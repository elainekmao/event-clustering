MALNUTRITION RATES AMONG CHILDREN IN THE DEMOCRATIC </p><p>PEOPLE\'S REPUBLIC OF KOREA (DPRK) HAVE DECLINED CONSIDERABLY </p><p>OVER THE PAST FOUR YEARS, ACCORDING TO THE SURVEY RELEASED </p><p>BY WFP AND UNICEF ON FEBRUARY 20, CONJOINTLY WITH THE HOST </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S CENTRAL BUREAU OF STATISTICS AND INSTITUTE OF </p><p>CHILD NUTRITION. MAJOR FINDINGS OF THE SURVEY ARE: A) THE </p><p>PROPORTION OF CHILDREN UNDERWEIGHT (WEIGHT-FOR-AGE) HAS </p><p>FALLEN FROM 61 PERCENT IN 1998 TO 21 PERCENT IN 2002; B) </p><p>WASTING, OR ACUTE MALNUTRITION (WEIGHT-FOR-HEIGHT), HAS </p><p>FALLEN FROM 16 PERCENT TO 9 PERCENT; AND C) STUNTING, OR </p><p>CHRONIC MALNUTRITION (HEIGHT-FOR-AGE), HAS DROPPED FROM </p><p>62 PERCENT TO 42 PERCENT.

END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>BACKGROUND </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>2. THIS NUTRITION ASSESSMENT - THE LARGEST OF ITS KIND EVER </p><p>TO BE UNDERTAKEN IN NORTH KOREA - COVERED BOTH CHILD AND </p><p>MATERNAL NUTRITION AND WAS CARRIED OUT IN OCTOBER 2002 BY </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT\'S CENTRAL BUREAU OF STATISTICS (CBS) AND </p><p>INSTITUTE OF CHILD NUTRITION (ICN), IN COLLABORATION WITH </p><p>UNICEF AND THE WORLD FOOD PROGRAM (WFP). THE SURVEY SAMPLE </p><p>INCLUDED 6,000 RANDOMLY SELECTED HOUSEHOLDS LOCATED IN 200 </p><p>RANDOMLY SELECTED RI AND DONG OF SEVEN PROVINCES (DPRK HAS </p><p>NINE PROVINCES), AND IN THREE CITIES. THE HOUSEHOLDS </p><p>SELECTED WERE THOSE WITH CHILDREN UNDER SEVEN YEARS OF AGE. </p><p>IN EACH HOUSEHOLD SELECTED, THE YOUNGEST CHILD WAS WEIGHED </p><p>AND MEASURED, AND INFORMATION COLLECTED ON HOUSEHOLD FOOD </p><p>SUPPLIES. IN HOUSEHOLDS WHERE THE CHILD WAS UNDER TWO YEARS </p><p>OF AGE, THE MOTHER WAS ALSO INTERVIEWED CONCERNING MATERNAL </p><p>AND CHILD HEALTH CARE PRACTICES, INFANT FEEDING PRACTICES, </p><p>AND MATERNAL FEEDING PRACTICES. MOTHERS OF CHILDREN UNDER </p><p>TWO YEARS OLD CHILDREN WERE ALSO WEIGHED AND MEASURED, AND </p><p>INVITED TO UNDERGO A HEMOGLOBIN EXAMINATION. </p><p> </p><p>3.

THEY WERE ASSISTED BY PROVINCIAL LEVEL LOGISTICS </p><p>TEAMS THAT ARRANGED FOR LOCAL PREPARATIONS AND SUPPORT IN </p><p>THE RI AND DONG, AND BY A PROVINCIAL LEVEL DATA ENTRY AND </p><p>QUALITY CONTROL TEAM. UNICEF AND WFP PROVIDED FINANCIAL AND </p><p>LOGISTICAL SUPPORT. THE INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH, LONDON </p><p>AND THAILAND HEALTH FOUNDATION, BANGKOK, PROVIDED TECHNICAL </p><p>ADVICE. CBS WAS DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR PREPARATION OF </p><p>QUESTIONNAIRE, IDENTIFICATION OF SURVEY TARGET HOUSEHOLDS, </p><p>ENLISTMENT AND TRAINING OF SURVEY TEAM MEMBERS, ORGANISATION </p><p>AND MONITORING OF FIELD SURVEY ACTIVITIES, REVIEW OF </p><p>QUESTIONNAIRES AND DATA COLLECTION, DATA ANALYSIS AND REPORT </p><p>WRITE-UP. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>FINDINGS </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>4. MAJOR FINDINGS OF THE SURVEY ARE: </p><p> </p><p>A) THE PROPORTION OF CHILDREN UNDERWEIGHT (WEIGHT-FOR-AGE) </p><p>HAS FALLEN FROM 61 PERCENT IN 1998 TO 21 PERCENT IN 2002; </p><p>B) WASTING, OR ACUTE MALNUTRITION (WEIGHT-FOR-HEIGHT), HAS </p><p>FALLEN FROM 16 PERCENT TO 9 PERCENT; AND </p><p>C) STUNTING, OR CHRONIC MALNUTRITION (HEIGHT-FOR-AGE), HAS </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ8202 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  00791  02 OF 02  260638Z </p><p>ACTION AID-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AGRE-00  AMAD-00  CA-01    CIAE-00  COME-00 </p><p>      USNW-00  DODE-00  DOEE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    MEDE-00 </p><p>      EAP-00   EB-00    EUR-00   FAAE-00  FBIE-00  UTED-00  VC-00 </p><p>      H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    L-00     VCE-00   M-00 </p><p>      AC-01    NEA-00   NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OCS-03   OES-00   OIC-02 </p><p>      PA-00    PER-00   PM-00    ACE-00   P-00     SCT-00   SP-00 </p><p>      IRM-00   TEST-00  TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00  SA-00    R-00 </p><p>      PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-01   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00 </p><p>      SWCI-00    /009W </p><p>                  ------------------3B7A29  260639Z /38 </p><p>P 260546Z FEB 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 8457 </p><p>INFO EU MEMBER STATES COLLECTIVE </p><p>AMEMBASSY BEIJING </p><p>AMEMBASSY SEOUL </p><p>AMEMBASSY TOKYO </p><p>AMEMBASSY CANBERRA </p><p>USEU BRUSSELS 3147 </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 02 ROME 000791 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>AIDAC </p><p> </p><p>FROM U.S. MISSION IN ROME </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  00791  02 OF 02  260638Z </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR A/S KELLY, A/S PRM DEWEY, IO A/S HOLMES, EAP/K </p><p>DONG AND BELLER, AND IO/EDA WINNICK </p><p>USDA/FAS FOR U/S PENN, MCHAMBLISS AND RTILSWORTH </p><p>USAID FOR ADMINISTRATOR NATSIOS, AA/DCHA WINTER, AA/ANE </p><p>CHAMBERLAIN, D/DCHA/FFP LLANDIS AND JBRAUSE </p><p>NSC FOR JDWORKEN </p><p> </p><p>E.O.  12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS:     EAID, PREL, UN, PREF, EAGR, ECON, KN, KS </p><p>SUBJECT: WFP/UNICEF DPR KOREA NUTRITION SURVEY SHOWS MARKED </p><p>DECLINE IN MALNUTRITION RATES AMONG CHILDREN </p><p> </p><p>DROPPED FROM 62 PERCENT TO 42 PERCENT. </p><p> </p><p>5. IN GENERAL, CAREFUL REVIEW OF THE RESULTS SUGGESTS THAT </p><p>REAL IMPROVEMENTS HAVE OCCURRED. THESE IMPROVEMENTS ARE, </p><p>HOWEVER, MUCH MORE PRONOUNCED FOR UNDERWEIGHT GAINS THAN </p><p>THEY ARE FOR STUNTING.  THE FALL IN UNDERWEIGHT ACROSS THREE </p><p>SURVEYS (1998, 2000 AND 2002) - FROM 60 PERCENT TO 28 </p><p>PERCENT TO 20 PERCENT - SHOWS A CONSISTENT TREND. </p><p> </p><p>6. HOWEVER, THE RATES OF CHILD UNDERWEIGHT AND STUNTING ARE </p><p>STILL HIGH AND REQUIRE CONTINUED AND SUSTAINED EFFORTS. </p><p>THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT MATERNAL NUTRITION IS FAR FROM </p><p>OPTIMAL WITH A THIRD OF MOTHERS MEASURED RECORDING LESS THAN </p><p>22.5 CM FOR MUAC. MOREOVER, ABOUT ONE-THIRD OF MOTHERS </p><p>COVERED BY THE SURVEY WERE OBSERVED TO BE BOTH MALNOURISHED </p><p>AND ANEMIC. </p><p> </p><p>7. THE ASSESSMENT PROVIDED THE FIRST OBJECTIVE ANALYSIS OF </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  00791  02 OF 02  260638Z </p><p>DIFFERING VULNERABILITY ACROSS THE COUNTRY.  STUNTING AMONG </p><p>CHILDREN IN NAMPO CITY WAS 25 PERCENT, FOR EXAMPLE, COMPARED </p><p>TO 48 PERCENT IN SOUTH HAMGYONG PROVINCE.  THE WASTING RATE </p><p>IN PYONGYANG WAS JUST UNDER 4 PERCENT, AGAINST 12 PERCENT IN </p><p>SOUTH HAMGYONG.  THE SURVEY FOUND SIMILAR PATTERNS IN FOOD </p><p>AVAILABILITY AND THE INCIDENCE OF CHILDHOOD DIARRHEA. UNICEF </p><p>AND WFP SAID SUCH PATTERNS CONFIRMED THEIR OBSERVATIONS FROM </p><p>FIELD MONITORING THAT THE NORTHEASTERN PROVINCES ARE MORE </p><p>VULNERABLE THAN OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>WFP/UNICEF CONCLUSION </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. THOUGH CHILD MALNUTRITION HAS FALLEN CONSIDERABLY, </p><p>ACCORDING TO THE SURVEY, BOTH WFP AND UNICEF COMMENTED THAT </p><p>THERE IS STILL "GREAT CAUSE FOR CONCERN." CITING WORLD </p><p>HEALTH ORGANIZATION (WHO) CRITERIA, THEY CONCLUDE THAT CHILD- </p><p>WASTING RATES ARE STILL HIGH, AND CHILD STUNTING RATES VERY </p><p>HIGH. JAMES T. MORRIS, WFP EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, COMMENTED </p><p>THAT:  "THE CRISIS IS NOT OVER. IF THE UN CAN\'T PROVIDE MORE </p><p>MEDICINE AND FOOD - AND QUICKLY - WE WILL SEE MALNUTRITION </p><p>RATES RISE AGAIN, UNDOING MUCH OF THE PROGRESS THAT HAS BEEN </p><p>MADE."
