<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 TEL AVIV 017508 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT PASS TO SECRETARY\'S PARTY </p><p> </p><p>E.O.  12958:  DECL:  11/05/05 </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, PGOV, XF, IS </p><p>SUBJECT:  A BLACK DAY FOR THE JEWISH NATION </p><p> </p><p>1. CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT.  CLASSIFIED BY RICHARD ERDMAN, </p><p>POL/C, PER SECTIONS 1.5(B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>2. NEWS OF RABIN\'S ASSASSINATION HAS LEFT ISRAELIS DAZED, </p><p>STUNNED, ANXIOUS, AND IN SHOCK.  THE FULL IMPACT HAS YET TO SINK </p><p>IN, OF COURSE.  BUT GIVEN RABIN\'S CENTRAL ROLE IN VIRTUALLY EVERY </p><p>PHASE OF ISRAEL\'S POLITICAL LIFE SINCE ITS CREATION, THE </p><p>PYSCHOLOGICAL, HISTORICAL, AND NATIONAL IMPACT IS BEING COMPARED </p><p>TO THAT FOLLOWING PRESIDENT KENNEDY\'S ASSASSINATION.  AS ONE </p><p>CONTACT PUT IT, THE OVERWHELMING SENSE OF SADNESS GOES FAR BEYOND </p><p>RABIN THE MAN; IT GOES TO THE HEART OF WHAT ISRAEL IS ALL ABOUT. </p><p>THERE IS THE SENSE THAT ISRAEL HAS LOST WHATEVER WAS LEFT OF ITS </p><p>ORGINAL INNOCENCE, ITS YOUTH, ITS SENSE OF INTIMACY AND </p><p>CONNECTEDNESS IN A SHARED FATE.  IN A WORD,  ALL THE THINGS THAT </p><p>HAVE MADE ISRAEL UNIQUE IN THE EYES OF ITS PEOPLE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  THAT RABIN WAS GUNNED DOWN BY A LONE ASSASSIN AS HE LEFT </p><p>PERHAPS THE LARGEST PEACE RALLY IN TEL AVIV HISTORY HAS MADE THE </p><p>SITUATION ALL THE MORE POIGNANT.  SOME 120,000-150,000 ISRAELIS-- </p><p>JOINED BY GOVERNMENT MINISTERS, KNESSET MEMBERS, AND AMBASSADORS </p><p>FROM EGYPT, JORDAN AND MOROCCO--HAD GATHERED IN THE CITY CENTER </p><p>TO EXPRESS THEIR SUPPORT FOR PEACE AND FOR RABIN\'S EFFORTS TO </p><p>ACHIEVE IT.  THE GUNSHOTS THAT FELLED HIM AND THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF </p><p>HIS DEATH ABOUT AN HOUR LATER TURNED A MASSIVE, JOYOUS EVENT INTO </p><p>A NATIONAL NIGHTMARE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  THE ASSASSINATION, THE FIRST EVER IN THE FORTY-SEVEN YEAR </p><p>HISTORY OF ISRAEL, IS BEING SEEN ACROSS THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM AS </p><p>AN ASSAULT ON ISRAELI DEMOCRACY AND AS A STERN REMINDER THAT </p><p>FRATERNAL VIOLENCE MUST BE CHECKED, LEST IT SPLINTER THE NATION </p><p>AS IT HAS IN THE PAST.  ILLUSTRATIVELY, THE JERUSALEM POST, NO </p><p>FRIEND OF RABIN OR OSLO II, EDITORIALIZED THIS MORNING THAT </p><p>"NOTHING, ABSOLUTELY NOTHING, IS A GREATER BLOW TO THE LIFE OF </p><p>THE JEWISH NATION THAN FRATERNAL VIOLENCE, AND NOTHING MAKES SUCH </p><p>VIOLENCE MORE THREATENING TO THE NATION\'S FUTURE THAN THE </p><p>ASSASSINATION OF THE HEAD OF GOVERNMENT."  ISRAEL\'S FATE, THE </p><p>COMMENTARY CONTINUES, DEPENDS ON ISRAELIS UNITING, DESPITE THEIR </p><p>POLITICAL DIFFERENCES, TO UTTERLY REJECT VIOLENCE BETWEEN JEWS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  A KEY POLLSTER WHO HAS DONE EXTENSIVE PRIVATE POLLING FOR </p><p>RABIN OVER THE YEARS DESCRIBED THE ASSASSINATION TO US AS THE </p><p>"PEAK OF THE POLARIZATION OF ISRAELI SOCIETY IN THE LAST DECADE." </p><p>NO ONE EXPECTED IT TO GO THIS FAR, BUT THERE IS A CLEAR SENSE </p><p>THAT A LINE HAS BEEN CROSSED, THAT THE PEACE PROCESS MUST NOT </p><p>STOP, AND THAT VIOLENCE AT ANY LEVEL CANNOT AND MUST NOT BE </p><p>ACCEPTED. </p><p> </p><p>6.  ACCORDING TO BOTH THIS AND OTHER CONTACTS, RABIN\'S </p><p>ASSASSINATION WILL WAKE UP THE MODERATE RIGHT, WHICH SUPPORTS THE </p><p>PEACE PROCESS BUT HAS DOUBTS ABOUT OSLO II.  AT THE SAME TIME, </p><p>PRESSURES WILL GROW TO JOIN RANKS AT A TIME OF NATIONAL CRISIS. </p><p>TOLERANCE FOR THE KIND OF UNCIVIL AND VIOLENT BEHAVIOR AND </p><p>RHETORIC THAT HAVE MARKED THE PAST FEW MONTHS WILL BE SHARPLY </p><p>REDUCED.  THE RIGHT, FACED WITH AN UPWELLING OF PUBLIC SUPPORT </p><p>FOR UNITY IN TIME OF NATIONAL CRISIS, WILL BE FORCED TO MODERATE </p><p>ITS OPPOSITION.  AND THE SECULAR AND RELIGIOUS COMMUNITIES, </p><p>HAVING LOOKED DOWN THE ABYSS OF FRATRICIDAL JEWISH STRIFE, WILL </p><p>BE UNDER INCREASED PRESSURE TO FIND A WAY TO LIVE TOGETHER WITH </p><p>GREATER MUTUAL TOLERATION AND RESPECT, DESPITE THEIR ENORMOUS </p><p>DIFFERENCES. </p><p> </p><p>7.  IN THIS ANALYSIS--WHICH WE THINK IS CLOSE TO THE MARK--THE </p><p>MODERATE RIGHT WILL BE CRITICAL TO EFFORTS TO STEM POLARIZATION </p><p>OVER THE PEACE PROCESS AND TO BRIDGE THE GAPS BETWEEN THE LEFT </p><p>AND RIGHT.  IF THESE MODERATES DECIDE THAT THEIR SIDE--THE RIGHT- </p><p>-HAS HELPED BRING ON A NATIONAL CRISIS BY TAKING ITS OPPOSITION </p><p>TOO FAR, THERE COULD BE A BACKLASH.  THE SETTLERS COUNCIL\'S </p><p>ANNOUNCEMENT TODAY THAT IT WILL CEASE ITS ACTIVE RESISTANCE TO </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT CENSUS MAY BE AN EARLY SIGN OF THE KIND OF </p><p>MODERATING PRESSURES THAT WILL BE AT WORK.  OPPOSITION LEADER </p><p>NETANYAHU\'S SUPPORT THIS MORNING IN THE KNESSET FOR LABOR TO FORM </p><p>THE NEXT GOVERNMENT, AND HIS PRIVATELY EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT THE </p><p>PUBLIC WILL HOLD LIKUD RESPONSIBLE FOR CONTRIBUTING TO AN </p><p>ATMOSPHERE IN WHICH SUCH A TRAGIC EVENT COULD TAKE PLACE, MAY BE </p><p>A FURTHER INDICATION.  WHATEVER THE CASE, MOST PEOPLE WE HAVE </p><p>SPOKEN WITH ARE CONVINCED THAT LABOR WILL BENEFIT FROM AN </p><p>OUTPOURING OF SYMPATHY AND SUPPORT AS WELL AS THE PUBLIC\'S </p><p>PREFERENCE TO GO WITH THE DEVIL THEY KNOW. </p><p> </p><p>8. WITH THE NATION IN SHOCK AND MOURNING, ISRAELIS ARE NOT YET </p><p>FOCUSSING MUCH ON LONGER TERM POLITICAL SUCCESSION ISSUES.  FOR </p><p>THOSE WHO ARE, A KEY QUESTION IS WHO CAN BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN </p><p>LEFT AND RIGHT.  FOR ALL THE CONTROVERSY SURROUNDING HIS PEACE </p><p>POLICIES AND OUTSPOKENESS, RABIN TO SOME EXTENT BRIDGED THAT </p><p>LEFT-RIGHT DIVIDE AND WAS NEVER SEEN AS A MAN ONLY OF THE LEFT. </p><p>PERES, DESPITE HIS IMPROVING PUBLIC IMAGE IN RECENT MONTHS, BY </p><p>CONTRAST IS WIDELY IDENTIFIED AS A MAN OF THE LEFT AND DISTRUSTED </p><p>BY MANY ON THE RIGHT.  BOTH IN HIS TRANSITION ROLE AND AS PRIME </p><p>MINISTER, SHOULD HE BE ASKED TO FORM A NEW GOVERNMENT, A KEY </p><p>QUESTION WILL BE WHETHER PERES CAN BOTH CARRY THE LABOR BLOC AS </p><p>WELL AS BRING ALONG THE CRUCIAL CENTER AND CENTER-RIGHT. IN THIS </p><p>REGARD, THERE IS SPECULATION THAT POPULAR LABOR FEDERATION LEADER </p><p>AND KNESSET MEMBER HAIM RAMON, WHO HAS A MORE CENTRIST POLITICAL </p><p>IMAGE, WILL PLAY A KEY ROLE IN ATTRACTING THE MODERATE RIGHT, </p><p>BROADENING THE GOVERNMENT\'S BASE, AND MODERATING THE LEFT-RIGHT </p><p>DIVIDE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>INDYK </p><p></p></div>
