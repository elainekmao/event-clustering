<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L HAVANA 00781 </p><p> </p><p>USIA FOR AR, P/G, B/CR; DEPT FOR ARA/CCA; </p><p>ROME ALSO FOR VATICAN; CINCLANT FOR POLAD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS:        PREL, PGOV, CU, SP </p><p>SUBJECT:     SPAIN AND CASTRO </p><p> </p><p>REF:         MABRID 1246 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  USINT APPRECIATES EMBASSY MADRID\'S EXCELLENT </p><p>REPORT ON SPAIN\'S GROWING DISENCHANTMENT WITH FIDEL </p><p>CASTRO.  WE FOLLOW THE SPANISH-CUBAN RELATIONSHIP AS </p><p>CLOSELY AS WE CAN FROM HAVANA, AND OUR INFORMATION TRACKS </p><p>WELL WITH THAT IN REFTEL.  WE OFFER A COUPLE OF THOUGHTS </p><p>FROM THE HAVANA PERSPECTIVE. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>2.  (C)  MORE THAN MOST, THE SPANIARDS HAVE INDULGED IN </p><p>WISHFUL THINKING ABOUT FIDEL CASTRO.  PERHAPS BECAUSE </p><p>OF HIS GALICIAN ROOTS, PERHAPBSECAUSE OF HIS POWERFUL </p><p>PERSONALITY, PERHAPS BECAUSE OF HIS CAREFULLY CULTIVATED </p><p>ROMANTIC IMAGE AS THE CARIBBEAN DAVID FACING THE NORTH </p><p>AMERICAN GOLIATH, THEY HAVE TENDED TO GIVE HIM THE </p><p>BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT.  THEY ALSO THOUGHT THEY HAD </p><p>SPECIAL INFLUENCE.  IF THEY EVER DID, THEY NO LONGER </p><p>HAVE.  CASTRO HAS NOW SHOWN THAT HE CAN BE AS DISMISSIVE </p><p>OF FELIPE GONZALEZ AS HE CAN OF ANYONE ELSE WHO OFFERS </p><p>HIM ADVISE HE DOES NOT LIKE. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>3.  (C)  THE SPANIARDS -- AND FOR THAT MATTER MOST </p><p>WEST EUROPEANS -- HAVE BEEN SLOW TO RECOGNIZE CASTRO </p><p>FOR WHAT HE IS:  A SOMETIMES CHARMING BUT ALWAYS </p><p>RUTHLESS DICTATOR.  NOW THAT THEY ARE LESS LIKELY TO </p><p>RATIONALIZE HIS EGREGIOUS BEHAVIOR (SUCH AS THE </p><p>CURRENT CRACKDOWN ON HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS) THEY SEEM </p><p>TO BE MORE LIKELY TO OVERREACT TO IT.  THEY TEND TO </p><p>SEE THE CURRENT SITUATION IN MORE APOCALYPTIC TERMS </p><p>THAN THEY MIGHT HAVE IF THEIR VISION HD NOT BEEN </p><p>CLOUDED BY ROMANTICISM AND WISHFUL THINKING FOR THREE </p><p>DECADES.  MOREOVER, MADRID\'S PESSIMISM PROBABLY ALSO </p><p>REFLECTS THAT OF SPANISH EMBASSY PERSONNEL HERE WHO </p><p>SEEM TO TAKE CASTRO\'S INTRANSIGENCE AS A PERSONAL </p><p>AFFRONT.  THEY HAVE ALSO BEEN DISILLUSIONED BY THE </p><p>RECENT HARDLINE PRONOUNCEMENTS OF PCC IDEOLOGY CHIEF </p><p>CARLOS ALDANA TO WHOM THEY HAD EARLIER IMPUTED THE </p><p>ROLE OF INNER CIRCLE LIBERAL. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>4.  (C)  ALL OF THIS IS NOT TO SUGGEST THAT THE </p><p>CASTRO REGIME IS NOT IN CRISIS.  AND IT IS VERY </p><p>POSSIBLE, EVEN LIKELY THAT CHANGE, WHEN IT COMES, WILL </p><p>BE VIOLENT.  HOWEVER WE BELIEVE THAT THE CUBAN REALITY </p><p>HAS NOT CHANGED AS MUCH AS THE SPANISH PERCEPTION OF IT. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>5.  (C)  FINALLY, WITH REGARD TO WHETHER OR NOT CASTRO </p><p>WILL BE INVITED TO THE SEVILLE SUMMIT, MWE HAVE SEEN </p><p>PRESS REPORTS IN THE PAST TWO WEEKS QUOTING FELIPE </p><p>GONZALEZ TO THE EFFECT THAT AS LONG AS HE WAS ISSUING </p><p>THE INVITATIONS, CASTRO WOULD GET ONE.  THAT STATEMENT, </p><p>IF ACCURATELY REPORTED WOULD SEEM TO OVERTAKE THE </p><p>SUGGESTION IN PARAGRAPH 11 OF REFTEL THAT THE GOS </p><p>MIGHT USE THE INVITATION FOR LEVERAGE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FLANIGAN </p><p></p></div>
