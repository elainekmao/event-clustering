The Mission\'s INL program officer and PAS office worked </p><p>closely on the press release and PAS did an excellent job in </p><p>spreading the good news.  PAS also posted the press release, </p><p>photos from the ceremony, and the Ambassador\'s remarks on the </p><p>Embassy web page.  Publicity from the event also caught the </p><p>attention of other government ministers who were quick to </p><p>approach the INL program officer for additional details on </p><p>the distribution of the funds. </p><p> </p><p>3.
