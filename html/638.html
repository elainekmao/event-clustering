THE WITNESS SAID </p><p>THAT EKREM CUDIC FROM BRCKO WAS FORCED TO WORK EVEN </p><p>THOUGH VERY ILL AND WAS BADLY BEATEN FOR NOT BEING </p><p>ABLE TO WORK HARDER.  ONE DAY, EKREM CUDIC TOOK AWAY </p><p>A GUARD\'S RIFLE AND SLAPPED HIM.  THE OTHER GUARDS </p><p>SHOT AND KILLED HIM. </p><p> </p><p>12.

UNTIL THEN, </p><p>PRISONERS HAD ONLY ONE BLANKET APIECE TO COVER THE </p><p>BARE CONCRETE FLOOR.  AFTERWARDS, THEY WERE GIVEN </p><p>STRAW FOR THE FLOOR.  BEFORE THE ICRC ARRIVED, A CORN </p><p>CRIB WAS EMPTIED AND SOME OF THE MEN WERE MOVED </p><p>THERE.  THE ICRC WAS TOLD THESE MEN WERE REFUGEES, </p><p>NOT PRISONERS.

THE NAME OF </p><p>THE CAMP WAS ALSO CHANGED FROM "CONCENTRATION CAMP </p><p>BATKOVIC" TO "COLLECTIVE CENTER BATKOVIC".
