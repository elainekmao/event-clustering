<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ROME 000579 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DOL FOR ILAB/BRUMFIELD </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR DRL/IL AND EUR/WE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: ELAB, PGOV, PGOV, IT, IT ELAB </p><p>SUBJECT: PARLIAMENT PASSES AMBITIOUS LABOR MARKET REFORM </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  00579  01 OF 02  131309Z </p><p>REF: ROME 294 </p><p> </p><p>1. SUMMARY: PARLIAMENT LAST WEEK APPROVED A SWEEPING REFORM </p><p>OF ITALY\'S RIGID EMPLOYMENT RULES.  THE MEASURE IS ONE OF </p><p>THE MAIN STRUCTURAL ECONOMIC REFORMS PROMISED BY THE </p><p>BERLUSCONI GOVERNMENT AND THE FIRST TO BE APPROVED BY THE </p><p>PARLIAMENT. THE NEW MEASURES ARE DESIGNED TO GIVE EMPLOYERS </p><p>MORE FLEXIBILITY TO TAILOR THEIR WORKFORCE TO CHANGING </p><p>NEEDS. THE GOVERNMENT BELIEVES THE REFORMS WILL HELP REDUCE </p><p>UNEMPLOYMENT AND BOOST THE COMPANIES\' GROWTH. EMPLOYERS ARE </p><p>PREDICTABLY SATISFIED WITH THE REFORMS. TRADE UNIONS ARE </p><p>SPLIT INTO TWO FACTIONS: CISL AND UIL SUPPORT THE MEASURES </p><p>IN PRINCIPLE, THOUGH THEY WILL SEEK SOME ADJUSTMENTS VIA THE </p><p>IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS, WHILE CGIL, ITALY\'S LARGEST AND </p><p>MOST LEFT-LEANING CONFEDERATION, OPPOSES THEM. THE REFORMS </p><p>SHOULD INCREASE THE EMPLOYMENT RATE OF YOUNG PEOPLE AND </p><p>REDUCE THE NUMBER OF INFORMAL JOBS, BUT ADDITIONAL REFORMS </p><p>WILL BE NEEDED TO IMPROVE THE OVERALL LABOR PICTURE. END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. ON FEBRUARY 5, THE SENATE APPROVED THE BIAGI LAW, A </p><p>SWEEPING REFORM OF RULES GOVERNING ITALY\'S RIGID LABOR </p><p>MARKETS. THE LAW, NAMED FOR THE LABOR MINISTRY ADVISOR </p><p>ASSASSINATED LAST YEAR FOR ADVOCATING THE REFORMS, IS ONE OF </p><p>THE MAIN STRUCTURAL REFORMS ANNOUNCED BY BERLUSCONI AND THE </p><p>FIRST APPROVED. </p><p> </p><p>3. THE LAW INTRODUCES NEW KINDS OF FLEXIBLE LABOR CONTRACTS, </p><p>INCLUDING: "JOB ON CALL" (UNDER WHICH THE EMPLOYER PAYS THE </p><p>WORKER A RETAINER AND CAN EMPLOY HIM WHENEVER AS NEEDED); </p><p>JOB SHARING; AND "STAFF LEASING" (ESSENTIALLY HIRING WORKERS </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  00579  01 OF 02  131309Z </p><p>FROM AN EMPLOYMENT AGENCY). IT ALSO REDUCES BARRIERS TO PART- </p><p>TIME HIRING IN ORDER TO ENCOURAGE EMPLOYMENT OF YOUNG PEOPLE </p><p>AND WOMEN. COMPANIES WILL RECEIVE MORE FREEDOM TO </p><p>"OUTSOURCE" ASPECTS OF THEIR BUSINESS AND WILL BE REQUIRED </p><p>TO PROVIDE MORE TRAINING TO APPRENTICESHIP EMPLOYEES. THE </p><p>LAW LIMITS THE USE OF FREE-LANCE CONTRACTS (CURRENTLY WIDELY </p><p>USED BY COMPANIES TO EMPLOY ADDITIONAL STAFF WITHOUT </p><p>ASSUMING THE LONG-TERM FINANCIAL LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH </p><p>FORMALLY HIRING NEW FULL-TIME WORKERS) AND ENCOURAGES </p><p>EMPLOYERS INSTEAD TO USE SHORT-TERM CONTRACTS.  THE LAW ALSO </p><p>PARTIALLY PRIVATIZES EMPLOYMENT AND OUTPLACEMENT SERVICES, </p><p>WHICH WILL NOW BE PROVIDED NOT ONLY BY LARGELY INEFFECTIVE </p><p>PUBLIC AGENCIES BUT ALSO BY PRIVATE AGENCIES, CONSULTANTS </p><p>AND UNIVERSITIES TRYING TO REDUCE THE MISMATCH BETWEEN </p><p>SUPPLY AND DEMAND OF EMPLOYMENT. </p><p> </p><p>4. PASSAGE OF THE MEASURE CAPS 18 MONTHS OF DEBATE AND </p><p>DISPUTE OVER LABOR MARKET REFORMS.  IT BUILDS ON A REFORM </p><p>PACKAGE PASSED IN 1997 BY THE THEN CENTER-LEFT D\'ALEMA </p><p>GOVERNMENT THAT PERMITTED FOR THE FIRST TIME SOME USE OF </p><p>PART-TIME AND FREE-LANCE WORKERS.  BOTH PACKAGES ARE </p><p>DESIGNED TO REDUCE UNEMPLOYMENT (WHICH VARIES REGIONALLY </p><p>FROM 4% IN NORTHERN ITALY TO 20% IN SICILY AND OTHER PARTS </p><p>OF SOUTHERN ITALY) AND THE "INFORMAL" (AND UNTAXED) </p><p>EMPLOYMENT ARRANGEMENTS UNDER WHICH ALMOST 20% OF THE </p><p>WORKFORCE  IS EMPLOYED.  IN OCTOBER 2001, LABOR MINISTER </p><p>MARONI ISSUED A WHITE BOOK CONTAINING THE PROPOSED REFORMS. </p><p>CONFINDUSTRIA, THE MAIN EMPLOYERS\' ASSOCIATION, AGREED </p><p>ALMOST COMPLETELY ON THE NEED FOR PROPOSED REFORMS, AND TWO </p><p>OF THE THREE LARGEST LABOR CONFEDERATIONS, CISL AND UIL, </p><p>AGREED TO DISCUSS THEM.  THE LARGEST LABOR CONFEDERATION, </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  00579  01 OF 02  131309Z </p><p>CGIL, HOWEVER, DISAGREED ON THE CONCEPT OF THE PROPOSED </p><p>REFORM AND OPPOSED IT. </p><p> </p><p>5. THE NEW LAW DOES NOT ADDRESS THE BERLUSCONI GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>CONTROVERSIAL PROPOSALS TO GIVE EMPLOYERS MORE FLEXIBILITY </p><p>TO FIRE WORKERS.  THAT PROPOSAL, WHICH IS PROCEEDING </p><p>SEPARATELY THROUGH PARLIAMENT, PROVOKED THE HARSH REACTION </p><p>OF ALL THREE CONFEDERATIONS LAST YEAR THAT CULMINATED IN A </p><p>GENERAL STRIKE IN APRIL. AFTERWARD CISL AND UIL AGREED TO </p><p>RESUME NEGOTIATION. THE PACT FOR ITALY, WHICH WAS SIGNED IN </p><p>JULY BY EMPLOYERS, THE GOI AND MOST TRADE UNIONS (BUT NOT </p><p>CGIL), PROVIDES FOR A LIMITED AND EXPERIMENTAL REFORM OF </p><p>ARTICLE 18 AND INTRODUCES SOME FLEXIBILITY IN THE LABOR </p><p>MARKET. ON FEBRUARY 18, PARLIAMENT WILL DEBATE ON THE BILL </p><p>THAT WOULD REFORM ARTICLE 18. THAT TIMETABLE NO DOUBT WAS </p><p>INFLUENCED (AS WAS THE APPROVAL OF THE BIAGI LAW) BY THE </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL COURT\'S DECISION LAST MONTH TO A PERMIT A </p><p>POPULAR REFERENDUM ON THE PROVISION (REFTEL).  PARLIAMENT </p><p>WILL ALSO DISCUSS REFORMS TO UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS SCHEMES. </p><p> </p><p>6. ANTONIO D\'AMATO, THE PRESIDENT OF CONFINDUSTRIA, CALLED </p><p>THE BIAGI REFORM LAW "THE MOST RELEVANT IN THE LAST THIRTY </p><p>YEARS" AND SAID HE EXPECTS IT TO GENERATE INCREASES IN </p><p>EMPLOYMENT. CISL AND UIL CONSIDER IT POSITIVE BUT </p><p>INEFFECTIVE WITHOUT NEW PRIVATE AND PUBLIC INVESTMENT IN </p><p>INFRASTRUCTURE AND IN THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR.

LABOR MINISTRY </p><p>UNDERSECRETARY MAURIZIO SACCONI ANNOUNCED THAT THE GOI WAS </p><p>READY TO RESUME DIALOGUE WITH SOCIAL PARTNERS, CGIL </p><p>INCLUDED, ON THE IMPLEMENTING DECREES, STARTING WITH </p><p>EMPLOYMENT SERVICES, STAFF LEASING AND OUTSOURCING. TIZIANO </p><p>TREU, ONE OF THE LEADERS OF THE MODERATE CENTER LEFT PARTY, </p><p>THE DAISY, AND FORMER LABOR MINISTRY, CONSIDERS USELESS THE </p><p>MAIN PART OF THE LAW. </p><p> </p><p>7. THE BIAGI LAW\'S PASSAGE IS NOT THE FINAL WORD ON LABOR </p><p>REFORM.  THE GOI MUST NOW ISSUE IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS (IN </p><p>ACCORDANCE WITH THE PRINCIPLES OUTLINED IN THE LEGISLATION) </p><p>TO DETAIL EXACTLY HOW THE NEW FORMS OF FLEXIBILITY, AND THE </p><p>REVISION OF PART-TIME AND FREE LANCE CONTRACTS, WILL BE </p><p>IMPLEMENTED, IN OBSERVANCE OF THE PRINCIPLES PROVIDED BY THE </p><p>LAW ITSELF.  THE GOVERNMENT HAS TWELVE MONTHS TO COMPLETE </p><p>THIS PROCESS AND HAS PLEDGED TO CONSULT CLOSELY WITH BOTH </p><p>EMPLOYERS AND TRADE UNIONS IN DRAFTING THE RULES.  CLEARLY, </p><p>THE CISL AND UIL HOPE TO USE THIS PROCESS TO ADDRESS SOME OF </p><p>THEIR MISGIVINGS ABOUT THE BROAD PROPOSALS.  THE LABOR </p><p>MINISTRY REPORTEDLY HAS ALREADY DRAFTED MANY OF THE </p><p>IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS AND HOPES TO HAVE THE BULK OF THEM </p><p>IN PLACE BY THIS SUMMER. </p><p> </p><p>8. COMMENT ITALY\'S HIGH LEVEL OF UNEMPLOYMENT (8.9 PERCENT), </p><p>AND ITS LOW EMPLOYMENT RATE (AT 55 PERCENT, THE LOWEST IN </p><p>EUROPE), DEMONSTRATE THE LACK OF INNOVATIONS AND INVESTMENTS </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  00579  02 OF 02  131309Z </p><p>OF COMPANIES AND THE RIGIDITIES OF THE LABOR MARKET. </p><p>BERLUSCONI\'S CENTER-RIGHT GOVERNMENT WANTS TO ADDRESS BOTH </p><p>ISSUES BY INTRODUCING NEW KINDS OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR WORKERS </p><p>AND COMPANIES.  THE MEASURES APPROVED APPEAR CRUCIAL FOR </p><p>REDUCING INFORMAL JOBS AND THE UNEMPLOYMENT OF YOUNG PEOPLE, </p><p>WHICH WILL SUPPORT ECONOMIC GROWTH.  WE DON\'T BELIEVE THEY </p><p>WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO RAISE THE EMPLOYMENT RATE OF WOMEN AND </p><p>TO INCREASE THE ACTIVITY RATE(THE NUMBER OF BOTH EMPLOYED </p><p>AND UNEMPLOYED EXPRESSED AS PERCENTAGE OF THE TOTAL </p><p>POPULATION).  THOSE CHALLENGES WILL REQUIRE A CHANGE IN THE </p><p>WELFARE SERVICES DEVOTED TO FAMILIES IN ORDER TO PARTIALLY </p><p>EXEMPT FROM PERSONAL CARE FUNCTIONS, AND EXTRA INVESTMENTS </p><p>IN TRAINING AND COUNSELING. IN SOUTHERN ITALY THE LACK OF </p><p>INVESTMENT AND INFRASTRUCTURE ARE THE MAIN WEAKNESSES, WHICH </p><p>MUST BE ADDRESSED IN ORDER TO STIMULATE JOB CREATION. </p><p> </p><p>9. WE EXPECT CGIL AND THE COMMUNIST RENEWAL PARTY (RC) WILL </p><p>CONTINUE TO STRONGLY OPPOSE THE BIAGI LAW\'S REFORM MEASURES, </p><p>INCLUDING VIA STRIKES AND POLITICAL INITIATIVES SUCH AS </p><p>POPULAR REFERENDA.  IN DEFENDING THEIR TRADITIONAL CONCEPT </p><p>OF THE LABOR MARKET, CGIL AND THE RC WILL FOCUS THEIR </p><p>OBJECTIONS ON THE REFORM PACKAGE\'S CREATION OF "UNSTABLE </p><p>JOBS" INSTEAD OF LONG-TERM OR PERMANENT CONTRACTS. THE GOI </p><p>WILL NEED TO MAKE EXTRA EFFORTS TO EXPLAIN TO PUBLIC OPINION </p><p>THE NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR UNEMPLOYED WORKERS AND TO POINT </p><p>OUT THE CONSERVATIVE AND UNFRUITFUL APPROACH OF THE LEFT </p><p>THAT OPPOSES THE REFORM OF LABOR MARKET AND PROPOSED THE </p><p>REFERENDUM ON THE EXTENSION OF ARTICLE 18 TO BE HELD NEXT </p><p>SPRING.
