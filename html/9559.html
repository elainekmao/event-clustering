<p>UNCLAS THE HAGUE 001844 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FAA LONDON FOR JOSEPH TEIXERA </p><p>STATE FOR EB/TRA FOR M.WALKLET AND S.PARSON </p><p>USEU FOR J.KESSLER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAIR, ECON, NL, ENIV </p><p>SUBJECT: AIRCRAFT NOISE:  DUTCH PARLIAMENT RAISES NEW </p><p>CONCERNS ABOUT SCHIPHOL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.     Summary.  The Dutch parliament is reviewing aircraft </p><p>noise levels in response to pressure from communities in the </p><p>area of Amsterdam Schiphol Airport.  Sleep disturbances have </p><p>increased as the 5th runway has come on line.  It remains to </p><p>be seen whether or not the study will lead to a change in </p><p>regulations, but it is likely that if the debate were to </p><p>continue, it will pose a challenge to advocates of further </p><p>airport expansion.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.     A study of airport noise commissioned by the Dutch </p><p>Second Chamber revealed a significant increase in sleep </p><p>disturbances as a result of airport expansion.  The findings </p><p>may lead to changes in limits set for air travel at </p><p>Amsterdam\'s airport.  The Second Chamber is frequently the </p><p>target of lobbying by city councils in townships surrounding </p><p>Amsterdam Schiphol Airport who have opposed plans to expand </p><p>the airport.  The latest study, conducted by the Royal </p><p>Institute of Health and Environmental, measured the degree of </p><p>sleep disturbance among a sample population.  It found a </p><p>significant increase since the 2002 opening of the airport\'s </p><p>fifth runway.  Developers of the new runway originally </p><p>claimed its addition to the airport would reduce sleep </p><p>disturbances in the region.  The findings of the environment </p><p>and health study will be paired with an economic impact </p><p>study, and the package will be presented to the Second </p><p>Chamber for review.  The Parliament will then make a </p><p>recommendation for whether or not to change standing </p><p>regulations on air traffic.  Dutch regulations set a ceiling </p><p>for the total number of "sleep-disturbed residents" in the </p><p>Schiphol area, in addition to limiting night flights and </p><p>specifying flight paths, </p><p> </p><p>3.     Maryanne Heijman of the Environmental Division of the </p><p>Civil Aviation Authority said the Transport Ministry hopes </p><p>economic factors will receive full consideration as the </p><p>Second Chamber considers the noise abatement issue.  Heijman </p><p>predicts that there will be no change in the regulations </p><p>governing noise restrictions until at least 2006, but she </p><p>does expect the discussion to continue within the Chamber, </p><p>among community organizations, and in the press.  News of the </p><p>study has put the issue back on the front pages of Dutch </p><p>newspapers. </p><p> </p><p>4.     Comment:  The airport\'s rapid growth over the past 10 </p><p>years, coupled with industrial development in the "Amsterdam </p><p>Airport Area", are significant drivers of the Netherlands\' </p><p>economy.  Schiphol just finished a major expansion phase and </p><p>has further plans for increasing commercial air business in </p><p>the near future.  The Ministry of Transport and its private </p><p>sector allies argue that continued development of the airport </p><p>-- services and facilities -- is key to the country\'s future </p><p>competitiveness and economic growth.  The noise pollution </p><p>issue could undermine their expansion campaign.  But whether </p><p>or not it will reignite debate over aircraft standards (read </p><p>hushkits) remains to be seen.  End Comment. </p><p>RUSSEL </p><p></p></div>
