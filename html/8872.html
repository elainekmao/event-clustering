<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 06 HANOI 001549 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR INL/AAE; EAP/BCLTV; INR/EAP/SEA; L/LEI </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: SNAR, PREL, PGOV, KCRM, PINS, VM, CNARC </p><p>SUBJECT:  NARCOTICS CERTIFICATION PROCEDURES FOR 2003 </p><p> </p><p>REF:      A.  STATE 153955         G.  Hanoi 1043 </p><p>          B.  STATE 99648          H.  Hanoi 353 </p><p>          C.  UNVIE 373            I.  Hanoi 549 </p><p>          D.   02 Hanoi 2980           J.  Hanoi 1504 </p><p>E.   02 STATE 190339          K.  Hanoi 550 </p><p>F.   HCMC 499            L.  Hanoi 117 </p><p>                                   M.  Hanoi 1538 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  In response to ref a request, post is providing </p><p>responses keyed to 2003 certification demarche points (ref </p><p>b) as follow: </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  Implementation of the counternarcotics Master Plan </p><p>for 2001-2005: </p><p> </p><p>--This is an ongoing activity that continues to make slow </p><p>but steady progress.  The United Nations Office of Drugs and </p><p>Crime (UNODC) continues its support with a USD 276,000 </p><p>project designed to assist the GVN to finalize the plan </p><p>(which now is extended to 2010).  The USG is contributing </p><p>USD 100,000 to the project.  According to UNODC Resident </p><p>Representative Dr. Doris Buddenberg, the GVN submitted its </p><p>final draft to UNODC in January and the plan now is in the </p><p>Office of the Government (Prime Minster\'s office) waiting </p><p>for approval.  According to Dr. Buddenberg, approval should </p><p>be forthcoming "soon," as MPS and MOLISA have resolved </p><p>interagency issues concerning responsibilities for drug </p><p>treatment and rehabilitation. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  Continued focus on narcotics-related corruption, </p><p>including policy statements that make it clear that </p><p>narcotics-related corruption will not be tolerated and will </p><p>be severely punished, including the removal and prosecution </p><p>of corrupt officials, when found: </p><p> </p><p>--The UN, law enforcement agencies, and even the GVN view </p><p>corruption in Vietnam as an endemic problem that exists at </p><p>all levels and in all sectors.  In its public statements, </p><p>the GVN takes a strong stand against corruption in general, </p><p>but has not singled out narcotics-related corruption for </p><p>specific attention.  Colonel Bui Xuan Bien, the director of </p><p>the Standing Office for Drug Control (SODC), confirmed that </p><p>"any GVN official who violates laws about corruption" would </p><p>be prosecuted.  A major criminal case (that of "Mafia" chief </p><p>"Nam Cam" in Ho Chi Minh City) included charges of </p><p>corruption, in addition to crimes such as murder, assault, </p><p>gambling, etc.  Two defendants had been expelled from the </p><p>Communist Party of Vietnam\'s Central Committee in 2002 in </p><p>connection with this case; one of these had also been a Vice </p><p>Minister of Public Security.  Another defendant had been the </p><p>Deputy Supreme Prosecutor.  Of the 155 defendants, including </p><p>numerous police officials, 154 were found guilty.  There </p><p>were six death sentences and a variety of other prison </p><p>sentences, including life imprisonment.  On the day of the </p><p>verdict, one of Nam Cam\'s top syndicate officials, Nguyen </p><p>Van Hoa, and seventeen others were arrested in Japan for </p><p>trafficking in heroin, according to press reports.  In </p><p>March, nine MPS officials were judged guilty for bribery. </p><p>In June, the People\'s Court in Quang Nam province in central </p><p>Vietnam sentenced the director of a state-run construction </p><p>company to life imprisonment for embezzlement.  In another </p><p>case, President Tran Duc Luong rejected leniency pleas from </p><p>two former executives sentenced to death for a scheme to </p><p>"appropriate state property through graft," according to a </p><p>May press report. </p><p> </p><p>--Senior GVN officials continue to speak out against </p><p>corruption.  In late January, Prime Minister Phan Van Khai </p><p>visited MPS and emphasized the need to fight all crime and </p><p>corruption.  In March, the Prime Minister said that </p><p>officials who "turn a blind eye to drug-related crime will </p><p>be punished."  In February, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs </p><p>spokesperson said in response to a question that the GVN </p><p>considers the fight against corruption "an important task." </p><p> </p><p>--A bilateral anti-corruption agreement with Sweden, </p><p>providing about USD 2.7 million to fund research on socio- </p><p>economic policy and anti-corruption measures over a three- </p><p>year period was signed in 2002.  Under the agreement, Sweden </p><p>is supporting a study on the "institutional framework of </p><p>anti-corruption policies."  While the official agreement is </p><p>with the Ministry of Planning and Investment, the actual </p><p>partner is the Communist Party of Vietnam and, according to </p><p>an official of the Swedish Development Corporation, the </p><p>program is "quite sensitive."  A diagnostic study on how to </p><p>implement the program "should be started by the end of the </p><p>year." </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  Developing and implementing regulations enabling </p><p>the tools provided in the new counternarcotics law to be </p><p>used fully and effectively to investigate major drug- </p><p>trafficking groups: </p><p> </p><p>-- The National Assembly passed a comprehensive </p><p>counternarcotics law on December 9, 2000, which came into </p><p>effect on June 1, 2001.  The GVN directed MPS and other </p><p>ministries, including the Ministry of Justice (MOJ), to </p><p>agree on a common approach for implementation.  In addition, </p><p>MOJ was tasked with working with MPS and other relevant </p><p>agencies to review existing counternarcotics legal documents </p><p>and make appropriate amendments to facilitate implementation </p><p>of the new law.  According to Dr. Buddenberg, UNODC is </p><p>assisting the GVN in an "ad hoc" manner in this area, </p><p>especially concerning implementing decrees and legal </p><p>training.  There is now a "donor coordination" group </p><p>consisting of Sweden, Denmark and the USAID-funded Support </p><p>for Trade Acceleration project that meets once a month to </p><p>discuss legal issues; however, the focus is not specifically </p><p>on narcotics. </p><p> </p><p>--Since our last report, the GVN has made public eight </p><p>decrees related to the counternarcotics law.  These decrees: </p><p>a.  list the narcotic substances and pre-substances; </p><p>b.  guide the control of lawful drug-related activities in </p><p>Vietnam; </p><p>c.  stipulate the rehabilitation order, procedures, and </p><p>regimes for drug addicts consigned to compulsory </p><p>rehabilitation centers; </p><p>d.  designate family organization and community-based </p><p>rehabilitation; </p><p>e.  prescribe the regime of compensation and allowances for </p><p>individuals, families, agencies, and organizations suffering </p><p>life, health, and property damage while participating in </p><p>drug prevention activities; </p><p>f.  stipulate the rewards and commendations for individuals, </p><p>families, agencies, and organizations recording achievements </p><p>in drug prevention; and, </p><p>g.  assign responsibility on international cooperation in </p><p>the field of drug prevention.  According to DEA\'s Hanoi </p><p>Country Office, this decree contains no concrete formulation </p><p>fro creating a framework to allow for information sharing </p><p>and/or cooperative law enforcement efforts, however.  The </p><p>decree also does not provide implementing regulations for </p><p>international controlled deliveries, which is at least </p><p>mentioned in the 2001 drug law. </p><p> </p><p>--An eighth (and key) decree, concerning law enforcement, </p><p>has apparently been issued, but according to an MPS </p><p>official, it has not been made public due to its </p><p>"sensitivity."  According to DEA, without knowing what is in </p><p>this decree and/or without access to MPS officers, DEA (and </p><p>other foreign law enforcement entities) are unable to know </p><p>what law enforcement training would be most useful. </p><p> </p><p>--A preliminary analysis by a UNODC legal official concluded </p><p>that the decrees are "insufficient in terms of establishing </p><p>a proper drug control legal system," however.  The decrees </p><p>tend to focus on drug control areas, which are "generally </p><p>less complex and controversial," the official added.  There </p><p>is still a need for "new and proper" legal instruments in </p><p>areas such as procedures, conditions, systems for </p><p>investigations, international cooperation, extradition, </p><p>controlled delivery, and maritime cooperation, according to </p><p>the analysis. </p><p> </p><p>--Another problem is Vietnam\'s lack of judicial capacity. </p><p>The UNODC\'s Dr. Buddenberg lamented that this issue is </p><p>"still not adequately addressed" by the donor community. </p><p>Without improved judicial capacity, concrete progress in </p><p>this area "will be difficult," she opined. </p><p> </p><p>--While not directly related to the drug law, on May 29 the </p><p>GVN issued Decree 58, which deals with the control of </p><p>import, export, and transit of drug substances, precursors, </p><p>additive drugs, and psychotropical substances.  According to </p><p>the decree, only businesses authorized by the Ministries of </p><p>Health, Industry, and Public Security can import/export drug </p><p>substances, precursors, additive drugs and psychotropical </p><p>substances for specific, licit purposes.  The GVN has tasked </p><p>MPS to coordinate with other concerned ministries and </p><p>agencies to manage and control the import/export of these </p><p>narcotic substances.  While this decree may prove useful, </p><p>thus far the GVN has shown a tendency not to use the laws </p><p>already on the books in a proactive manner. </p><p> </p><p>--While the counternarcotics law allows for law enforcement </p><p>techniques such as controlled deliveries, the GVN appears </p><p>reluctant to engage in this area and/or meaningfully </p><p>cooperate with DEA\'s Hanoi Country Office or other law </p><p>enforcement entities in Hanoi (ref l).   In January, </p><p>February, and March 2003, DEA informed MPS\' counternarcotics </p><p>unit (C-17) about three major heroin shipments transiting </p><p>Vietnam.  C-17 officials did not respond or react to the DEA- </p><p>provided information.  According to DEA, implementing </p><p>controlled delivery techniques could have resulted in major </p><p>seizures.  In addition, even when DEA has offered funding to </p><p>assist in an operation, DEA\'s MPS counterparts have not </p><p>cooperated.  Furthermore, the MPS continues to stick to its </p><p>line that it is unable to share operational information with </p><p>DEA due to "national security considerations." </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  Increased seizures of opium, heroin, and </p><p>amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS), followed by increased </p><p>investigations and prosecutions of traffickers: </p><p> </p><p>--The GVN has continued to arrest and prosecute drug </p><p>traffickers in 2003, but there is a relative decline thus </p><p>far in 2003.  According to GVN statistics, during the first </p><p>five months of calendar year 2003, there were 4,135 drug </p><p>cases with 6,310 suspects arrested.  If projected over the </p><p>entire year, it appears that case numbers will decline </p><p>significantly - by 30 percent in the number of cases and by </p><p>35 percent in the number of suspects arrested. (Note:  For </p><p>past drug reports, we have routinely received such </p><p>statistics from SODC.  Despite several requests, SODC </p><p>declined to provide us with updated drug statistics in 2003. </p><p>We instead obtained the information from the Ministry of </p><p>Labor, Invalids, and Social Affairs - MOLISA, which also </p><p>plays a role in counternarcotics activities, primarily in </p><p>the drug treatment and rehabilitation area.  End note.) </p><p>Concerning arrest and case statistics, DEA and other law </p><p>enforcement entities have not changed their view that most </p><p>arrests involve relatively low-level street dealers. </p><p> </p><p>--On the seizure front, the official press (and post - ref </p><p>j) reported on a major seizure of 40 kilograms of heroin </p><p>that occurred in June.  This seizure represents over 65 </p><p>percent of the total amount of heroin seized in Vietnam </p><p>(57.4 kilograms) during 2002.  Despite this relatively </p><p>impressive seizure, the UN\'s "Mini-Dublin" 2003 report noted </p><p>that, Vietnam remains a "major transit route for drug </p><p>traffickers, with Vietnamese traffickers demonstrating </p><p>increased sophistication in trafficking techniques and </p><p>concealment."  The report further stated that Vietnam is </p><p>atypical in that very few drugs (at least until this recent </p><p>seizure) are seized at border crossings, indicating the </p><p>"inefficiency of Vietnam\'s border control capacity." </p><p> </p><p>--Attempting to address this issue, UNODC (supported </p><p>primarily by the USG) will implement beginning in July 2003 </p><p>a project to improve law enforcement and information </p><p>capacity within the GVN.  Concerning prosecutions, the GVN, </p><p>according to law enforcement sources, moves fairly </p><p>vigorously to prosecute those arrested.  However, those </p><p>prosecuted are generally street-level dealers.  In addition, </p><p>GVN law enforcement authorities have not demonstrated the </p><p>will to pursue higher-level narcotics traffickers, according </p><p>to DEA. </p><p> </p><p>--Vietnam\'s threshold for the death penalty is among the </p><p>lowest in the world and drug sentences tend to be harsh. </p><p>Possession of 100 grams of heroin or 20 kilograms of opium </p><p>can result in the death penalty, according to SODC and press </p><p>reports.  An April press report noted that a man and his </p><p>wife in Vung Tau were sentenced to death for trafficking </p><p>33.3 kilograms of opium and 0.3 kilograms of heroin.  From </p><p>January to April 2003, 27 drug traffickers were sentenced to </p><p>death.  On June 12, a 15-year old Australian - Vietnamese </p><p>girl received a life sentence for attempting to bring about </p><p>six-tenths of one kilogram of heroin into Vietnam, according </p><p>to a press report. </p><p> </p><p>--MOLISA\'s statistics for seizures other than heroin also </p><p>point to a sharp downward trend.  Projecting the January - </p><p>May statistics over CY 2003, opium seizures may decline 48 </p><p>percent; cannabis 54 percent, and ATS by nearly 75 percent. </p><p>Dr. Tran Xuan Sac, Director of National Policy and Planning </p><p>in MOLISA\'s Department of Social Evils Prevention, </p><p>nonetheless predicted that seizures would "probably </p><p>increase" over the course of the year, while declining to </p><p>explain how or why. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  Productive cooperation with regional neighbors, </p><p>including Laos, the PRC, and Burma to reverse threatening </p><p>trends in narcotics trafficking: </p><p>--During 2003, Vietnam has continued efforts at regional </p><p>cooperation.  According to a January 2003 "People\'s Police" </p><p>press report, from 1998 to the end of 2002 the GVN sent 122 </p><p>delegations, including over 700 counternarcotics police </p><p>officials, to overseas training and/or conferences.  Vietnam </p><p>has existing counternarcotics MOUs with the PRC, Burma, </p><p>Thailand, Cambodia, and Laos.  In May, Vietnam was set to </p><p>host an "MOU Conference" in Hanoi, but the conference was </p><p>postponed until October due to SARS.  According to SODC and </p><p>press reports, in March MPS Deputy Minister Le The Tiem </p><p>visited the PRC and discussed bilateral drug cooperation </p><p>with the leadership of the PRC\'s Drug Control Committee. </p><p>Tiem also traveled to Thailand to learn more about </p><p>Thailand\'s drug control activities; during this visit, Tiem </p><p>also proposed hosting a drug control conference among six </p><p>Vietnamese northern border provinces and two PRC border </p><p>provinces.  In February, another GVN delegation traveled to </p><p>Thailand to attend a regional conference on controlling </p><p>opium poppy cultivation.  In April, Vietnamese and Lao </p><p>provincial counterparts from Nghe An and Laos\' Xiengkhouang </p><p>provinces met to improve cross-border counternarcotics </p><p>cooperation.  In June, Vietnam hosted the ASEAN Senior </p><p>Officials Meeting on Transnational Crime (SOMTC) and </p><p>Counterterrorism as well as separate SOMTC+EU, SOMTC+China, </p><p>SOMTC+3, and SOMTC+US sessions.  The meetings included a </p><p>discussion on regional drug issues. Specifically, the </p><p>Burmese delegation discussed the need for an enhanced </p><p>regional approach.  According to DEA, there is no evidence </p><p>that the attendance of GVN law enforcement officials at </p><p>regional or international fora leads to enhanced </p><p>cooperation, however. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  Continued eradication of domestic illicit poppy </p><p>cultivation and support of crop-substitution projects to </p><p>eliminate it completely: </p><p> </p><p>--The USG officially estimates that there are about 2,300 </p><p>hectares of opium poppy under cultivation in Vietnam. </p><p>However, there has not been a satellite-based opium yield </p><p>survey since 2000.  This estimate is considered high by the </p><p>GVN, UNODC, and law enforcement sources.  The GVN estimates </p><p>approximately 315 hectares of poppy cultivation in generally </p><p>remote, mountainous regions.  According to UNODC\'s "Global </p><p>Illicit Drug Trends (2002), "due to small production, </p><p>Vietnam cultivation figures have been included in the `other </p><p>Asia\' category since 2000."  In 1999, the last year Vietnam </p><p>was considered independently, UNODC estimated opium </p><p>cultivation at 442 hectares.  Based on numerous provincial </p><p>visits, there appears to be a sincere effort to eradicate </p><p>poppy, when found.  However, GVN officials have admitted </p><p>that complete eradication is unrealistic, given the </p><p>remoteness of mountainous areas in the northwest and extreme </p><p>poverty among ethnic minority populations who still use </p><p>opium for medicinal purposes.  Regrowth in remote areas, </p><p>particularly in the northwest, remains a small, but </p><p>apparently persistent problem, as does limited cannabis </p><p>growth in areas near the Cambodian border.  According to </p><p>SODC\'s Bien, the GVN eradicated 124 hectares of opium poppy </p><p>during the first quarter of CY 2003, virtually all of it in </p><p>the northwest.  Bien confirmed that "when we find poppy, we </p><p>eradicate it." </p><p> </p><p>--Regarding crop substitution, there is a major UNODC </p><p>project (with significant USG support) ongoing in the Ky Son </p><p>district of Nghe An province, one of the drug "hotspots" in </p><p>northern Vietnam.  This project, currently in its second </p><p>phase, includes a crop substitution/alternative development </p><p>component, where various types of fruit trees and other </p><p>enterprises, such as bee raising, have been implemented in </p><p>areas formerly dedicated to poppy.  UNODC\'s Buddenberg </p><p>viewed the first phase as "successful," with an increase in </p><p>agricultural production and corresponding drop in drug </p><p>activity.  Based on an Embassy monitoring visit in April </p><p>(ref g), there is progress in the livestock and agricultural </p><p>models (the focus of USG assistance); however, the selection </p><p>process of those receiving project assistance was not clear, </p><p>a problem that UNODC is now addressing.  A similar project </p><p>planned in Son La province, another drug area along the Lao </p><p>border, will not proceed.  Prior to the proposed project </p><p>signing, the GVN requested an alternate project location and </p><p>more autonomy in administering the project.  UNODC declined </p><p>to meet the GVN\'s demands; after deliberation, UNODC decided </p><p>not to proceed. </p><p> </p><p>--In addition to Ky Son, the GVN\'s Ministry of Agriculture </p><p>and Rural Development (MARD) has continued to support </p><p>projects in various provinces.  The GVN, through MARD, </p><p>independently supports crop substitution projects in other </p><p>provinces, including Hoa Binh, Yen Bai, Ha Giang, Cao Bang, </p><p>and Lang Son.  The GVN has tasked MARD to develop a national </p><p>crop substitution proposal to include in the GVN\'s 2001-2005 </p><p>Master Plan.  To avoid indirectly encouraging poppy </p><p>cultivation through subsidies for eradication, the GVN has </p><p>placed all crop substitution subsidies under national </p><p>programs to alleviate poverty in poor, mountainous regions. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U)  Continued focus on creating a legal framework to </p><p>address money laundering and other forms of financial </p><p>crimes: </p><p> </p><p>--At present, money laundering is not considered a major </p><p>issue in Vietnam because of the state-controlled banking </p><p>system and high transaction costs.  However, partly due to </p><p>the work on terrorist financing, over the last year there </p><p>has been a growing awareness and concern among State Bank of </p><p>Vietnam (SBV) officials on the issue of money laundering and </p><p>financial crimes in general.  SBV officials have begun to </p><p>work with the U.S., the IMF, and other donors to identify </p><p>and address weaknesses in their banking system.  However, </p><p>without major reform (including greater transparency), it </p><p>will be difficult for sufficient safeguards to be </p><p>introduced.  According to a 2003 UNODC report, "Vietnam is </p><p>obviously ill equipped to fight the escalation in financial </p><p>crimes unfolding in most of Southeast Asia."  While the </p><p>State licenses wholly foreign-owned and joint venture state- </p><p>private banks to operate alongside the State commercial </p><p>banks, their market penetration and asset base are small. </p><p>Foreign exchange currency controls for private and joint </p><p>venture banks are considered to be strict.  However, the </p><p>banking system in Vietnam is segmented and lacks real, </p><p>transparent, and easily verifiable controls.  Although banks </p><p>are under the supervision of the State Bank, that </p><p>supervision is minimal.  Vietnam is in the process of </p><p>implementing banking reform as part of their World Bank and </p><p>IMF loans, and some of that reform is relevant to these </p><p>issues (increased transparency, more effective regulation, </p><p>and overall stability of the banking system).  It will be </p><p>critical that reform of the banking system is accompanied by </p><p>law enforcement training regarding financial crimes. </p><p> </p><p>--There is currently no specific law in Vietnam regarding </p><p>money laundering, although it is mentioned in the </p><p>comprehensive counternarcotics law very generally, but </p><p>internal discussion has begun on the need to draft specific </p><p>regulations on this issue.  According to UNODC, the GVN is </p><p>aware of the potential problem and "trying to take </p><p>preventive measures" such as inviting international experts </p><p>and participating in ILEA training.  To that end, post had </p><p>lined up several appropriate State Bank officials to attend </p><p>ILEA-sponsored training on financial crimes in May; </p><p>unfortunately, Vietnam\'s participation in the course was </p><p>cancelled by ILEA due to SARS. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U)  Increasing efforts to support drug awareness and </p><p>prevention, demand reduction, and treatment of drug users </p><p>and addicts: </p><p> </p><p>-- The GVN views drug awareness and prevention as a </p><p>significant objective in its fight against drugs as well as </p><p>an integral part of its efforts fully to comply with the </p><p>1988 UN Drug Convention.  The GVN has continued a steady </p><p>drumbeat of anti-drug propaganda, culminating in June\'s drug </p><p>awareness week (the week of June 23).  If last year\'s </p><p>activities are any guide, during the week youth and mass </p><p>organizations will engage in various activities to spread </p><p>the anti-drug message.  These include art contests, </p><p>speeches, and meetings.  Within the past few months, state- </p><p>controlled television has begun a weekly program called "SOS </p><p>Drugs" and has been airing a series of anti-heroin spots. </p><p>According to the UNODC\'s Buddenberg, Vietnam and UNODC will </p><p>be signing an agreement to implement a demand reduction </p><p>project (supported mainly by Italy) "within the next few </p><p>months." </p><p> </p><p>-- By the end of 2002, the GVN admitted officially to </p><p>142,000 registered addicts, although the UN and other </p><p>agencies suspect the actual number is substantially higher. </p><p>Even that official figure is 25 percent higher than 2001. </p><p>MOLISA is the GVN ministry tasked with providing drug </p><p>treatment services.  Since 2001, emboffs have visited most </p><p>drug treatment centers in northern Vietnam as well as some </p><p>in the south.  According to SODC, there are 73 centers at </p><p>the provincial level, which have a capacity of between 50 to </p><p>3,000 addicts each.  Provincial authorities run most </p><p>centers, but some are supported by mass organizations, such </p><p>as the Youth Union.  Drug treatment centers range from the </p><p>most basic to relatively modern.  Most suffer from a lack of </p><p>physical and material resources.  The addict population is a </p><p>combination of those who enter voluntarily and others who </p><p>are undergoing "compulsory" treatment.  Drug treatment, as </p><p>with other public sector services in Vietnam, suffers from a </p><p>lack of resources.  However, the GVN has continued efforts </p><p>to expand drug treatment in 2003.  According to a March </p><p>press report, of 142,000 addicts, approximately 48,000 had </p><p>undergone detoxification treatment. </p><p> </p><p>--Some drug treatment centers suffered some escapes, likely </p><p>due in part to a 2002, GVN decree that mandated minimum </p><p>stays of one year.  No such escapes have been reported in </p><p>2003, however.  Vocational training in the centers is </p><p>uneven, ranging from fairly good to nonexistent.  This is </p><p>mainly due to a lack of resources.  Lack of resources has </p><p>also had a negative impact on the GVN\'s plan to improve drug </p><p>treatment in one of Vietnam\'s "hotspot" provinces, Nghe An. </p><p>A 700-bed center was scheduled to fully open in early 2003, </p><p>but due to funding constraints, this has been delayed until </p><p>the end of 2003, according to MOLISA\'s Dr. Sac.  Presently, </p><p>there are "only a few addicts" staying in the partially </p><p>completed facility, he added. </p><p> </p><p>--In addition to drug treatment centers, those with less </p><p>severe addictions may be treated under a community-based </p><p>treatment scheme (ref I).  Despite apparently good </p><p>intentions, it appears that implementation is rather thin </p><p>and uneven, with "peer pressure" the main component of </p><p>treatment following detoxification.  Community-based </p><p>treatment nonetheless at least provides addicts with a </p><p>supportive infrastructure (and limited vocational training) </p><p>that would otherwise not be available. </p><p> </p><p>--During its June 2003 session, the National Assembly </p><p>approved a five-year pilot project on post-treatment </p><p>vocational training developed by the HCMC People\'s </p><p>Committee.  The one to three-year program is compulsory for </p><p>those judged at high risk for returning to drugs.  It is </p><p>voluntary for others who have finished their compulsory </p><p>treatment and judged less at risk.  According to Nguyen </p><p>Hoang Mai of the National Assembly\'s Social Affairs </p><p>Committee, the goal of the program is to try to reduce the </p><p>relapse rate (generally estimated at about 80 percent, </p><p>similar to western countries) by providing recovering </p><p>addicts with more skills that will enable them to assume </p><p>"productive lives after treatment."  The pilot project, set </p><p>to begin on August 1, will be implemented in HCMC (where the </p><p>relapse rate may be as high as 90 percent), and other </p><p>provincial cities, according to press reports. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U)  Signing a narcotics agreement with the United </p><p>States to permit even closer counternarcotics cooperation </p><p>between Vietnam and the United States: </p><p> </p><p>--We are unable to report progress on this front during </p><p>2003.  The GVN has yet officially to respond to the </p><p>Department\'s October 2002 non-paper, despite repeated </p><p>promises to do so.  The GVN apparently harbors concerns over </p><p>concerning human rights, taxation, and the training </p><p>participant certification regarding non-drug trafficking </p><p>(refs k and m).  The MFA has also unofficially expressed </p><p>concern over what officials have termed the "small size" of </p><p>the projects attached to the draft Letter of Agreement </p><p>(LOA).  Senior GVN officials and official documents continue </p><p>to claim that signing the agreement remains a priority; this </p><p>view has not thus far translated to meaningful progress. </p><p>Both countries nonetheless agree in principle that an LOA </p><p>would enhance cooperation and allow the bilateral </p><p>relationship to develop further. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p></p></div>
