Summary: A year after Maoist insurgents unilaterally </p><p>broke a four-month truce with the government, this week saw </p><p>further reports of civilian deaths and widespread </p><p>destruction of public facilities. As two United Nations </p><p>agencies criticized the insurgency for exacerbating the </p><p>already precarious situation of the country\'s poor and </p><p>disadvantaged, children and schools continued to come under </p><p>Maoist threat, forcing some students to flee their homes to </p><p>avoid forced recruitment. Two interest groups publicly </p><p>opposed the upcoming "indefinite strike" against educational </p><p>institutions called by the insurgents.  Opinion polls showed </p><p>clear support for US military assistance and no faith in </p><p>offers for peace talks by the Maoists.  Conflict in the </p><p>Everest region has raised concerns that celebrations </p><p>commemorating the first successful ascent will have to be </p><p>canceled. End summary. </p><p> </p><p>NAT\'L HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION URGES END TO VIOLENCE; </p><p>CONFIRMS SEVEN CIVILIANS KILLED AT JUMLA </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p> </p><p>2. In a November 28 press statement released after a visit </p><p>to western Jumla district, the National Human Rights </p><p>Commission (NHRC) called on the Maoists to stop killing </p><p>unarmed civilians and destroying essential infrastructure </p><p>such as hospitals, schools and banks.   The fact-finding </p><p>mission, sent to investigate a November 14 battle between </p><p>Maoists and government forces (ref A), stated that four </p><p>civilians and three prisoners were among those killed. </p><p> </p><p>3. NHRC has also appealed to the government to address the </p><p>immediate needs of the local citizens and to provide </p><p>compensation to the families of civilian victims in Jumla </p><p>and in other incidents around the country.  In addition to </p><p>visiting the site of last week\'s battle, the team traveled </p><p>to southwestern Bardiya district to investigate the November </p><p>25 death of two students and a civilian woman who were </p><p>killed along with two police officers when a group of 12-15 </p><p>Maoists opened fire on a market. </p><p> </p><p>4. In a break with murderous precedent, sixteen of 18 </p><p>policemen kidnapped by the Maoists in their attack have been </p><p>released. (Note: Military and police prisoners were also </p><p>released following the September 7 attack in Arghankanchi. </p><p>End note.) </p><p> </p><p>JUMLA DAMAGE ESTIMATED AT 250,000 USD </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. The November 14 attack in Jumla did 20 million Nrs </p><p>(250,000 USD) worth of damage, according to local estimates. </p><p>Twenty-eight buildings, including the airport tower, bank, </p><p>post office and education office, were destroyed, together </p><p>with the private homes of three local families.  According </p><p>to local reports, Maoists ransacked the private houses after </p><p>they had taken control of the District Police office, </p><p>walking away with "whatever they could lay their hands on." </p><p>The local branch of Rastriya Banijya Bank claims that it </p><p>lost 1.9 million Nrs (24,300 USD) in cash, and 1.6 million </p><p>Nrs (20,400 USD) in gold.  A government assessment of the </p><p>damage is currently underway. </p><p> </p><p>MAOISTS DISRUPT POWER SUPPLY TO REMOTE DISTRICTS; </p><p>HYDRO PROJECT DELAYED BY ONE YEAR </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>6. Electricity supply to the entire midwestern and </p><p>farwestern regions has been affected by Maoist destruction </p><p>of a 132-kilovolt tower in southern Dang district. </p><p>Following destruction of the tower, Dang and four other </p><p>districts have had to tap into electricity from an adjacent </p><p>power grid.  As a result, all fourteen districts of the </p><p>midwestern and farwestern regions have had to resort to load- </p><p>shedding to meet the demand. </p><p>7. Meanwhile, the director of the 70-megawatt Middle- </p><p>Marsyangdi hydropower project announced that the insurgency </p><p>has delayed construction by least one year.  The conflict </p><p>has made it impossible for construction to continue on a 24- </p><p>hour basis, and tightened security has prevented the project </p><p>from transporting explosives to the construction site. </p><p>Middle-Marsyangdi is the third largest hydropower project in </p><p>the country.  A German development agency has supplied 85 </p><p>percent of the 175 million USD project. </p><p> </p><p>UNFPA BLAMES INSURGENCY FOR PLIGHT OF WOMEN </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. At a conference to address the effects of political </p><p>disruption on the women of South Asia, United Nations Family </p><p>Planning Agency (UNFPA) representative Bina Pradhan </p><p>expressed concern about the use of women in the Maoist </p><p>insurgency, and said that the conflict has placed Nepali </p><p>women in a desperate situation.  Citing threats against </p><p>civilians, Pradhan said that women and children have been </p><p>among the hardest hit. "At the same time that political </p><p>disturbance has forced many of them to flee homes," she </p><p>said, "those who stayed back are reeling in abject poverty." </p><p>Pradhan stated that women affected by the insurgency were in </p><p>danger of being trafficked as a result of social upheaval </p><p>and bleak economic conditions. </p><p> </p><p>CONFLICT ENDANGERS FOOD SUPPLY </p><p>FOR MARGINAL ECONOMIC GROUPS </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization </p><p>(FAO) has released a study identifying seven livelihood </p><p>groups as vulnerable to food shortages in the country, and </p><p>stating that the Maoist insurgency is contributing to an </p><p>already precarious situation.  The report recommended </p><p>immediate action to assist subsistence farmers with land of </p><p>less than 0.5 hectares, rural service providers, </p><p>agricultural laborers, porters and urban squatters, the </p><p>groups most affected by food shortage.  Subsistence farmers </p><p>make up 30 percent of Nepal\'s population and 80 percent of </p><p>those named as most vulnerable. </p><p> </p><p>10. The FAO report cited unproductive land, small-sized </p><p>holdings and lack of irrigation as among the chief causes of </p><p>the food shortage, and charged that the country\'s armed </p><p>conflict is aggravating the problem.  The report says that </p><p>the insurgency has cut off farming in "several areas," and </p><p>that many forests that served as food and fuel sources for </p><p>the Maoists--and for subsistence groups--have been made off- </p><p>limits by the government. (Note: Post reported food supply </p><p>issues in ref B. End note.) </p><p> </p><p>11. In southwestern Bardiya district, farmers report that </p><p>Maoists have warned them against harvesting their rice or </p><p>any other food grains.  The farmers expect that the </p><p>insurgents will steal the entire anticipated harvest of 40 </p><p>metric tons of grain. In northwestern Bajura, locals report </p><p>that Maoists are demanding food from the villagers at </p><p>gunpoint, and imposing taxes on subsistence farmers with no </p><p>cash.  When the farmers can\'t pay, the insurgents take a </p><p>portion of their harvest. </p><p> </p><p>STUDENTS LEAVE VILLAGES TO AVOID MAOIST DRAFT </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>12. In southern Sarlahi district, students are leaving their </p><p>villages and settling in town centers due to fear of being </p><p>used as human shields by the Maoists.  According to local </p><p>reports, Maoists have been pressuring village families to </p><p>provide 500 Nrs (7 USD) per month or send their children to </p><p>join the insurgency.  (Note: Most farming families in the </p><p>Terai region earn less than 10 USD per month. End note.) </p><p>Students in Sarlahi are afraid to attend school for fear of </p><p>being kidnapped, says a local teacher. </p><p> </p><p>13. Similar tales have come from areas throughout the </p><p>country, including far-eastern Ilam and southwestern Surkhet </p><p>districts.  In Ilam, 150 youths are reported to have fled </p><p>their homes to avoid extortion and forced recruitment, with </p><p>another 65 reported in Surkhet.  A local from one of the </p><p>villages in Surkhet claims that Maoists have already forced </p><p>70 lower caste or poor children to join the insurgency. </p><p> </p><p>14. The threats against students have come in the middle of </p><p>wheat-sowing season, depriving their struggling families of </p><p>much-needed extra labor. </p><p> </p><p>INTEREST GROUPS PROTEST SCHOOL CLOSINGS </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>15. At least two organizations have publicly criticized the </p><p>call by Maoists for an "indefinite strike" against </p><p>educational institutions.  Following a meeting with the </p><p>Minister of Education and Sports, members of the Private and </p><p>Boarding Schools\' Organization told reporters that they hope </p><p>to be able to convince Maoists that schools have already </p><p>been "set free" and that no further steps need to be taken. </p><p>The All Nepal National Free Students\' Union (ANNFSU) has </p><p>declared a plan to rally students from 500 schools and </p><p>colleges to protest the strikes. </p><p> </p><p>STUDENT INJURED BY ATTACK ON SCHOOL; </p><p>MAOISTS BOMB TRIBHUVAN UNIVERSITY </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>16. Officials from a Kathmandu school expressed relief that </p><p>only one student was injured when a Maoist bomb exploded on </p><p>the ground floor of a building packed with students and </p><p>teachers attending afternoon classes on November 28.  The </p><p>bomb, planted by a group of ten young men who forced their </p><p>way onto the campus grounds, exploded in the library, </p><p>destroying four computers and a photocopying machine, and </p><p>blowing out part of the brick wall.  The second and third </p><p>floors of the building were also damaged.  One student, who </p><p>was picking up his school certificates on the ground floor </p><p>when the bomb exploded, suffered minor injuries. </p><p> </p><p>17.  On November 29, an early-morning bomb exploded near the </p><p>administrative offices of Tribhuvan University on the </p><p>outskirts of Kathmandu. The blast damaged the building, but </p><p>no injuries were reported.  Tribhuvan is Nepal\'s oldest and </p><p>most prestigious university. </p><p> </p><p>OPINION POLLS SHOW NO FAITH IN PRACHANDA, </p><p>APPROVAL FOR US MILITARY AID </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>18. Two Internet opinion polls, recently published by the </p><p>weekly Nepali Times, show overwhelming support for US </p><p>military aid to Nepal and a clear lack of faith in Maoist </p><p>leader Prachanda\'s sincerity.  Respondents were 64.9 percent </p><p>in favor of US military aid. When asked whether Maoist </p><p>leader Prachanda is serious in his latest offer for peace </p><p>talks, 67.7 percent of respondents voted no, with only 26.6 </p><p>percent saying yes. </p><p> </p><p>CONFLICT THREATENS EVEREST JUBILEE </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>19. In yet another blow to tourism, trekking outfitters are </p><p>concerned that planned celebrations commemorating Sir Edmund </p><p>Hillary\'s historic first ascent of Mt. Everest in 1953 will </p><p>be disrupted by the ongoing conflict.  According to </p><p>newspaper reports, trekkers have heard Maoists in the </p><p>Everest region boast that they will attack Lukla airport </p><p>once the tourist season ends later this month, and Post has </p><p>heard increasing reports of Maoist activity in the area (ref </p><p>B).  British trekking outfitter Himalayan Kingdoms was </p><p>reported to be monitoring the situation daily, and prepared </p><p>to refund clients\' money if the security situation worsens. </p><p>The 50-year anniversary celebrations are scheduled to begin </p><p>early in 2003.  Tourism in Nepal is reported to have slumped </p><p>by more than 70 percent since the insurgency began. </p><p> </p><p>MAOISTS CONTINUE VIOLENCE AGAINST CIVILIANS </p><p>AND GOVERNMENT FACILITIES </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>20. Maoists in northeastern Taplejung district killed two </p><p>civilians on November 22, taking the young men to the </p><p>playground of a local secondary school before shooting them </p><p>in the back of the head.  On November 23, also in Taplejung, </p><p>Maoists called 28-year-old Laxmi Poudel from his house and </p><p>beheaded him in his front yard.  In the same village on the </p><p>same night, Maoists shot and killed a second young man after </p><p>abducting him from a wedding ceremony. Meanwhile, in </p><p>Kathmandu, Maoists detonated a pressure cooker bomb in the </p><p>home of an ex-policeman. No injuries were reported. </p><p> </p><p>21. On November 26, Maoists burned down the Brahmapuri </p><p>Village Development Committee in southern Sarlahi district, </p><p>destroying all village records.  On the evening of November </p><p>27, a bomb blast destroyed the land revenue office in </p><p>Taulihawa, the capital of southern Kapilbastu district. </p><p>Total loss from the incident is estimated at 500,000 Nrs </p><p>(6370 USD). </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
