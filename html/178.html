ABOUT </p><p>400 OF THE LEADERS HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED TO A PRISON </p><p>"OUTSIDE" MADRAS WHERE THE WILL BE HELD FOR A FEW DAYS </p><p>TO COOL OFF.  SMITH ADDED THAT VENKATRAMAN CERTAINLY </p><p>WASN\'T GOING TO STAY LATE AT THE OFFICE TO FOLLOW THE </p><p>MATTER AND CITED THIS AS AN EXAMPLE OF THE KIND OF </p><p>RELAXED VIEW HELD BY MOST GOTN OFFICIALS THEY SPOKE WITH. </p><p> </p><p>5.  CANADIANS SAW FOOD MINISTER S. RAMACHANDRAN (RAM) </p><p>EVENING OCTOBER 28.  RAM CONFIRMED TODAY\'S PRESS REPORTS </p><p>THAT MGR WILL RETURN TO MADRAS MID-MORNING OCTOBER 31 </p><p>VIA BOMBAY.
