<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 THE HAGUE 001730 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR S/WCI - PROSPER, EUR - BOGUE, EUR/SCE - </p><p>JONES/GREGORIAN, L/UNA - MATHIAS, L/EUR - LAHNE, INR/WCAD - </p><p>SPRIGG, USUN - ROSTOW </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 1.6 FIVE YEARS AFTER CLOSURE OF ICTY </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, BK, HR, SR, NL, ICTY </p><p>SUBJECT: ICTY: UK DRAFT UNSCR ON THE COMPLETION STRATEGY </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. (A) JOHNSON-ROSTOW E-MAIL 6/30/03 </p><p> </p><p>     B. (B) THE HAGUE 1510 </p><p>     C. (C) STATE 194768 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Legal Counselor Clifton M. Johnson per 1.5(b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) International Criminal Tribunal for the Former </p><p>Yugoslavia (ICTY) President Theodor Meron passed to embassy </p><p>legal counselor the draft of a Security Council resolution </p><p>developed by the UK that would require the ICTY Prosecutor to </p><p>implement key elements of the Tribunal\'s so-called completion </p><p>strategy.  As noted ref a, Meron explained that the draft </p><p>originated from UK FCO Legal Adviser Wood and was </p><p>subsequently refined to reflect Meron\'s input.  The text at </p><p>para 2 below, reflecting some additional input from Meron, </p><p>was passed back to the UK last week.  Some Embassy additions </p><p>are suggested in paras 3 and 4. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Begin text of draft UNSCR: </p><p> </p><p>"The Security Council, </p><p> </p><p>Recalling the statement made by the President of the Security </p><p>Council on 23 July 2002 (S/PRST/2002/21), </p><p> </p><p>Strongly reaffirming that the Tribunal should concentrate its </p><p>work on the prosecution and trial of the civil, military and </p><p>paramilitary leaders suspected of being responsible for </p><p>serious violations of international humanitarian law </p><p>committed in the territory of the former Yugoslavia since </p><p>1991, rather than minor actors, </p><p> </p><p>Endorsing once more the broad strategy of transferring cases </p><p>involving intermediary and lower-level accused to competent </p><p>national jurisdictions as likely to be in practice the best </p><p>way of allowing the Tribunal to achieve its current objective </p><p>of completing (investigations by 2004,) all trial activities </p><p>at first instance by 2008 (and appeals, reviews and other </p><p>proceedings around 2010) (the "completion strategy") </p><p>(S/2002/678, Annex) </p><p> </p><p>Having heard the joint presentation by the High </p><p>Representative to Bosnia and Herzegovina and the President of </p><p>the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia </p><p>("the Tribunal"), </p><p> </p><p>Having taken note of the recommendation of the Tribunal with </p><p>regard to the creation, as proposed by the High </p><p>Representative, of a special Chamber, within the State Court </p><p>of Bosnia and Herzegovina, to deal with serious violations of </p><p>international humanitarian law, </p><p> </p><p>      1. Welcomes with satisfaction the decision of the </p><p>Steering Board of the Peace Implementation Council of 12 June </p><p>2003 endorsing the approach outlined by the High </p><p>Representative concerning the establishment of a War Crimes </p><p>Chamber within the State Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina; </p><p> </p><p>      2. Urges the High Representative to establish the said </p><p>War Crimes Chamber as expeditiously as possible; </p><p> </p><p>      3. Notes that a Donors\' Conference will be held in The </p><p>Hague on . . . 2003 with a view to raising funds to finance </p><p>the establishment of the proposed War Crimes Chamber and, to </p><p>that end, invites States and relevant international and </p><p>regional organizations to contribute funds as well as to </p><p>provide qualified personnel to assist the Chamber in its work; </p><p> </p><p>      4. Notes the statement by the President of the Tribunal </p><p>that an essential prerequisite to achieving the objectives of </p><p>the completion strategy is the establishment and early </p><p>functioning of the War Crimes Chamber and that as soon as the </p><p>Chamber has begun to function, the Tribunal intends, pursuant </p><p>to its Rules of Procedure and Evidence, to consider referring </p><p>cases of lower or intermediate-level accused to the Chamber, </p><p>as well as to other competent national jurisdictions as </p><p>appropriate; </p><p> </p><p>      5. Notes with satisfaction the measures undertaken by </p><p>States of the former Yugoslavia with the support of other </p><p>States and relevant international and regional organizations, </p><p>to strengthen their national judicial systems in order to </p><p>facilitate the implementation of this policy and encourages </p><p>further such measures and support; </p><p> </p><p>      6. Further notes that since the Presidential statement </p><p>of 23 July 2003, (19) indicted persons remain at large and (. </p><p>. .) persons previously indicted have been taken into </p><p>custody, and that therefore issuing further indictments, </p><p>except in cases of civilian, military and paramilitary </p><p>leaders at the highest level, would be incompatible with </p><p>achieving the objectives of the completion strategy; </p><p> </p><p>      7. Aware that the Tribunal will be in a position to </p><p>complete its historic mission only with the apprehension and </p><p>prosecution of Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic and calls </p><p>upon all States to render all necessary assistance to the </p><p>Tribunal in its efforts to bring these and all other accused </p><p>persons to justice. </p><p> </p><p>      8. Requests the Prosecutor to henceforth concentrate on </p><p>issuing indictments only in the exceptional circumstances </p><p>specified in paragraph 6 above, on considering the referral </p><p>of cases to competent national jurisdictions as indicated in </p><p>paragraph 5 above, and to use, in the interests of efficiency </p><p>and justice, all appropriate means at her disposal to reduce </p><p>the length and complexity of all cases before the Tribunal. </p><p> </p><p>      9. Requests the President of the Tribunal to use his </p><p>best efforts to ensure that the objectives of the completion </p><p>strategy are achieved. </p><p> </p><p>      10. (Decides to remain actively seized of the matter.) </p><p> </p><p>End text of draft UNSCR. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Comment: The draft resolution would give a UNSC </p><p>imprimatur to the establishment of the war crimes chamber in </p><p>the new Bosnia State Court and restrict the investigative </p><p>mandate of the Office of the Prosecutor (OTP), marking two </p><p>steps forward toward meeting the goals of the completion </p><p>strategy.  However, the resolution is an opportunity for the </p><p>Council to emphasize other aspects of the ICTY\'s work that </p><p>are also critical to accomplishment of the completion </p><p>strategy goals.  For instance, the draft pays limited </p><p>attention to obligations of states to cooperate with the </p><p>Tribunal, an omission which would be especially striking </p><p>given the Tribunal\'s recent opinions on Belgrade cooperation </p><p>(ref b).  The resolution could draw upon UNSCR 1423 (2002), </p><p>operative paragraph 3, which "underlines that full </p><p>cooperation by States and entities with the International </p><p>Tribunal includes, inter alia, the surrender for trial of all </p><p>persons indicted by the Tribunal and provision of information </p><p>to assist in Tribunal investigations."  The Council could </p><p>also reaffirm its support for the mission of the ICTY, in </p><p>particular its contributing role -- as emphasized in this </p><p>year\'s guilty plea by Biljana Plavsic -- to peace and </p><p>reconciliation in the Balkans.  Finally, the draft correctly </p><p>identifies "the length and complexity" of cases before the </p><p>Tribunal as a problem posed to the completion strategy, but </p><p>to be fair, the resolution could also note that the chambers </p><p>play a role in ensuring efficient proceedings as well. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Comment, cont\'d:  The proposed draft UNCSCR focuses </p><p>solely on the Bosnia State Court and the scope of the </p><p>Prosecutor\'s mandate.  It does not address other issues </p><p>flagged in Ref C such as the UK initiative to split the </p><p>ICTY/ICTR prosecutorial functions and create a new chief </p><p>prosecutor position for the ICTR and the extension of Chief </p><p>Prosecutor Del Ponte\'s ICTY mandate to the end of 2004.  If a </p><p>decision is made to include all of these issues in a single </p><p>resolution, then that resolution would need to be issued in </p><p>September (given the expiration of the Prosecutor\'s mandate </p><p>in September), and it would make sense, if possible, to </p><p>advance President Meron and High Commissioner Ashdown\'s joint </p><p>presentation on the Sarajevo war crimes chamber to September </p><p>as well.  If we pursue two separate resolutions, then the </p><p>current notional calendar for Meron\'s visit -- joint address </p><p>with HR Ashdown on October 8, followed by his own report to </p><p>the UNGA on the 9th and presentation of the formal ICTY </p><p>report on the 10th -- would seem to work.  Would appreciate </p><p>USUN and the Department\'s understanding of the schedule of </p><p>these events and whether this is likely to hold or whether </p><p>the October 8 joint presentation will be advanced to </p><p>September.  End comment. </p><p>BAILY </p><p></p></div>
