<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KINSHASA 002795 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/17/2010 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, CG </p><p>SUBJECT: KABILA ADDRESSES NATION, ANNOUNCES REFORMS </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR WILLIAM LACY SWING FOR REASONS </p><p>1.5(B)(D) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) PRESIDENT JOSEPH KABILA ADDRESSED THE NATION AT THE </p><p>KIMBANGUIST CENTER MAY 17 ON THE FOURTH ANNIVERSARY OF </p><p>MOBUTU\'S OVERTHROW.  IN THIS, HIS FIRST PUBLIC ADDRESS HERE </p><p>SINCE HIS INAUGURATION ON JANUARY 26, KABILA ANNOUNCED THE </p><p>FOLLOWING MEASURES IN A BRIEF, LOW-KEY ADDRESS WHICH OFFERED </p><p>FEW DETAILS. </p><p> </p><p>-- REPLACEMENT OF CONTROVERSIAL DECREE 194 WITH OTHER </p><p>GUIDELINES FOR POLITICAL PARTY ACTIVITY; </p><p> </p><p>-- AMNESTY FOR ALL THOSE PRISONERS WHO HAVE NOT COMMITTED </p><p>SERIOUS CRIMES SUCH AS MURDER (WE UNDERSTAND THAT ABOUT 340 </p><p>DETAINEES IN ALL WILL BE FREED); AND, </p><p> </p><p>-- SOCIO-ECONOMIC MEASURES TO PROVIDE IMMEDIATE RELIEF TO THE </p><p>POPULATION. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) ALTHOUGH NOT IN HIS REMARKS, SEVERAL MINISTERS </p><p>CONFIRMED TO THE AMBASSADOR ON MAY 17 THE FOLLOWING </p><p>ADDITIONAL POSITIVE DEVELOPMENTS: </p><p> </p><p>-- THE FOUR CHILD-SOLDIERS WHICH HUMAN RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS </p><p>FEARED HAD BEEN EXECUTED HAVE, IN FACT, BEEN RELEASED THIS </p><p>WEEK (AND HAD NOT BEEN TORTURED); AND, </p><p> </p><p>-- THE NINETEEN "KADOGO" SOLDIERS FROM THE LATE PRESIDENT </p><p>LAURENT KABILA\'S PROTECTION UNIT HAVE NOT BEEN EXECUTED (AS </p><p>HAD BEEN RUMORED) AND HUMAN RIGHTS MINISTER NTUMBA, WITH WHOM </p><p>THE AMBASSADOR SPOKE ON MAY 17, HAS BEEN TO MAKALA PRISON </p><p>THIS WEEK TO VISIT THEM. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) COMMENT:  ALTHOUGH OPINION SEEMS SOMEWHAT DIVIDED ON </p><p>THE SIGNIFICANCE OF PRESIDENT KABILA\'S REMARKS, GIVEN THE </p><p>ABSENCE OF DETAIL, THE MORE GENERAL VIEW IS POSITIVE.  BASED </p><p>ON THE AMBASSADOR\'S MEETING WITH KABILA ON MAY 14, IT IS </p><p>CLEAR THAT HE IS KEENLY AWARE OF THE URGENT NEED FOR </p><p>POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC REFORMS, AND THIS WOULD APPEAR TO BE A </p><p>PROMISING BEGINNING. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SWING </p><p></p></div>
