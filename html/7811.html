<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 000742 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O 12958:N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECPS, ECON, ETRD, CE, ECONOMICS </p><p>SUBJECT: WI-FI SURVEY, SRI LANKA </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 85946 </p><p> </p><p>1.  Post response to reftel Wi-Fi survey request </p><p>follows: </p><p> </p><p>A)  Has host country allocated unlicensed radio- </p><p>frequency spectrum for use by Wi-Fi and similar </p><p>wireless technologies or is it planning to do so?  If </p><p>so are there separate allocations for indoor and </p><p>outdoor use?  Alternatively, is host country planning </p><p>to authorize Wi-Fi services as low-power devices </p><p>without a specific radio-service allocation? </p><p> </p><p>--  At the moment Wi-Fi is a licensed service and </p><p>allowed in the 2.4GHz and 2.43GHz band.  Sri Lanka </p><p>has not allocated unlicensed radio frequency spectrum </p><p>for Wi-Fi or any similar technologies. </p><p> </p><p>--  Sri Lanka is planning to allocate the full 2.4GHz </p><p>ISM band for indoor and part of 2.4GHz ISM band for </p><p>outdoor use with certain power level restrictions in </p><p>both categories. </p><p> </p><p>--  Telecommunications authorities are exploring the </p><p>possibility of making this license-exempt either for </p><p>private or commercial use or both.  But no decision </p><p>has been made yet. </p><p> </p><p>B)  Can Wi-Fi systems be used without a license in </p><p>host country?  If licenses are required what briefly </p><p>are the licensing procedures? </p><p> </p><p>--  Presently, Wi-Fi systems cannot be used without a </p><p>license.  The applicant should forward an application </p><p>form with the copy of specifications.  If technical </p><p>details are satisfactory, approval will be given and </p><p>an annual license is issued upon the payment of a </p><p>fee. </p><p> </p><p>C)  Can Wi-Fi systems be used for commercial purposes </p><p>without a license? </p><p> </p><p>No </p><p> </p><p>D)  Are there any commercial Wi-Fi networks that </p><p>provide service to the public currently operating in </p><p>host country? </p><p> </p><p>Yes </p><p> </p><p>E)  Can post provide any examples of how Wi-Fi is </p><p>currently being used in host country?  We are </p><p>particularly interested in developing country </p><p>examples that demonstrate how Wi-Fi can be used to </p><p>create digital opportunity and address social and </p><p>economic challenges. </p><p> </p><p>-- Currently, the Telecommunications Regulatory </p><p>Commission does not permit unlicensed operation in </p><p>2.4GHz band.  License operators are permitted to use </p><p>802.2 lb equipment with 30 MHz slot from 2.4 GHz to </p><p>2.43 GHz on shared basis.  The licensees fall into 3 </p><p>groups. </p><p> </p><p>-- 1.  Four facility-based data operators are using </p><p>this and other technologies to provide public </p><p>(commercial) data services, primarily Internet </p><p>access.  The maximum allowable output power for this </p><p>category is limited to 1 Watt.  This is for longer </p><p>distance outdoor applications. </p><p> </p><p>-- 2.  Four other large organizations are authorized </p><p>to use the same 30Mhz band with a maximum power of </p><p>100mW.  These users are permitted to use external </p><p>antenna and allowed to transmit within their </p><p>premises. </p><p> </p><p>-- 3.  Other small users are allowed to use this </p><p>equipment within (the above mentioned) 30Mhz band </p><p>with a maximum power of 100mW and are not permitted </p><p>to use other antennas except the original equipment </p><p>antennas. </p><p> </p><p>F)  We welcome whatever additional information about </p><p>Wi-Fi related host country developments that post </p><p>believes might be helpful.  Such information could </p><p>include: Is Wi-Fi in use in rural areas?  If so how </p><p>is "backhaul" connectivity provided to the Wi-Fi </p><p>system (i.e., via satellite, DSL lines, cable TV </p><p>networks)? Are there any longer distance (beyond 100 </p><p>meters outdoors) Wi-Fi networks in use in-country? </p><p>How many Wi-Fi units have been sold in host country? </p><p>-- The usage in rural areas is very limited.  The </p><p>backhaul connectivity is normally through DSL lines. </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
