REASONS: 1.5 (B) </p><p>AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) AMBASSADOR MCDONALD DELIVERED REF A DEMARCHE TO </p><p>MDC NATIONAL CHAIRMAN ISAAC MATONGO, WHO WAS ACCOMPANIED </p><p>BY MORGAN TSVANGIRAI\'S POLITICAL ADVISOR AND RIGHT-HAND </p><p>MAN, GANDI MUDZINGWA, IN THE ABSENCE OF MDC PRESIDENT </p><p>MORGAN TSVANGIRAI, WHO IS CURRENTLY OUT OF THE COUNTRY. </p><p>WE DO NOT EXPECT HIM TO RETURN UNTIL NEXT WEEK AT THE </p><p>EARLIEST.  DRAWING ON THE POINTS IN PARAGRAPH TWO OF REF </p><p>A, AMBASSADOR CONVEYED THE USG\'S STRONG CONCERN ABOUT </p><p>TSVANGIRAI\'S SEPTEMBER 30 STATEMENTS WARNING OF VIOLENCE </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>AGAINST MUGABE IF HE DOES NOT RESIGN SOON.  THESE </p><p>STATEMENTS ARE NOT HELPFUL FOR DEMOCRATIC DISCOURSE AND </p><p>COULD PROVIDE THE PRETEXT THE GOZ IS LOOKING FOR TO </p><p>CRACK DOWN HARSHLY ON THE MDC.  AMBASSADOR ADVISED IN NO </p><p>UNCERTAIN TERMS THAT TSVANGIRAI, GIVEN HIS LEADERSHIP </p><p>POSITION AND THE TENSE POLITICAL ATMOSPHERE, SHOULD NOT </p><p>SPEAK OF VIOLENT ACTIONS, EVEN OBLIQUELY, AND ONLY </p><p>CONSIDER PEACEFUL MASS ACTION. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) MATONGO RESPONDED BY SAYING THAT THE MDC AND ITS </p><p>PRESIDENT, MORGAN TSVANGIRAI, HAVE ALWAYS STOOD FOR NON- </p><p>VIOLENCE.  HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT TSVANGIRAI GOT CARRIED </p><p>AWAY.  MATONGO, WHO ATTENDED THE SEPTEMBER 30 RALLY AND </p><p>SAT NEXT TO THE MDC LEADER, QUOTED TSVANGIRAI AS SAYING </p><p>THE MDC WILL ALWAYS TRY TO CHANGE THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>PEACEFULLY, BUT IF MUGABE DOES NOT GO, THE PEOPLE WILL </p><p>TAKE MATTERS INTO THEIR OWN HANDS AND THE MDC LEADERSHIP </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  05666  051716Z </p><p>WILL BECOME BY-STANDERS.  DESPITE MONTHS OF VIOLENCE AT </p><p>THE HANDS OF RULING PARTY SUPPORTERS, THE MDC HAS NEVER </p><p>RESPONDED VIOLENTLY AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT.  ON THE </p><p>QUESTION OF MASS ACTION, THE MDC IS CONSULTING WITH </p><p>OTHER ORGANIZATIONS, BUT DOES NOT HAVE ANY PLANS FOR </p><p>MASS ACTION ANY TIME SOON.  MATONGO STATED THAT AT A </p><p>RALLY NEAR MUTARE EARLIER THIS WEEK, PEOPLE TOLD HIM </p><p>THAT THEY CANNOT WAIT UNTIL 2002 TO SEE MUGABE GO. </p><p>ZANU-PF IS INSTITUTING VIOLENCE AS ITS SOLE MEANS OF </p><p>STAYING IN POWER, MATONGO PROFESSED, AND CITED RENEWED </p><p>INTIMIDATION IN MARONDERA WEST, WHERE A PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>BY-ELECTION IS DUE TO BE HELD, MBERENGWA WEST, MREWA, </p><p>AND OTHER DISTRICTS.  SEVERAL MDC SUPPORTERS HAVE BEEN </p><p>BEATEN UP AND ONE HOSPITALIZED IN THE LAST WEEK, </p><p>ACCORDING TO THE MDC CHAIRMAN. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) COMMENT: IN OUR DISCUSSIONS WITH OTHER MDC </p><p>OFFICIALS THIS WEEK, WE HAVE IMPRESSED UPON THEM THE </p><p>IMPORTANCE OF REFRAINING FROM VIOLENT RHETORIC IN THIS </p><p>TENSE POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT.  ON SEPTEMBER 29, </p><p>AMBASSADOR HAD URGED TSVANGIRAI TO USE RESTRAINT AND </p><p>ABIDE BY THE LAW IN ANY MASS ACTION (REF D).  IT IS </p><p>CLEAR THAT THE MDC LEADERSHIP WAS EMBARRASSED BY </p><p>TSVANGIRAI\'S IMPRUDENT REMARKS.  PUBLICLY, IT HAS GONE </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>OUT OF ITS WAY TO PLAY DOWN THE STATEMENTS, SAYING THAT </p><p>TSVANGIRAI WAS MERELY WARNING MUGABE THAT PUBLIC ANGER </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>COULD FORCE HIM FROM POWER, AS IT HAS DONE WITH OTHER </p><p>DICTATORS (REF E).  INTERESTINGLY, MINISTER OF STATE FOR </p><p>NATIONAL SECURITY NICHOLAS GOCHE TOLD THE AMBASSADOR ON </p><p>OCTOBER 4 THAT THE BACK-AND-FORTH WITH THE MDC OVER THE </p><p>REMARKS IS MORE ABOUT POLITICS THAN ANYTHING ELSE (REF </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  05666  051716Z </p><p>B).  ON OCTOBER 4, IAN HAY-CAMPBELL, THE BRITISH DEPUTY </p><p>HIGH COMMISSIONER HERE, INFORMED US THAT THE MDC </p><p>EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE HAD DECIDED TO POSTPONE INDEFINITELY </p><p>ANY MASS ACTION IN LIGHT OF TSVANGIRAI\'S STATEMENT TO </p><p>AVOID A HARSH REACTION FROM THE GOVERNMENT.  MATONGO </p><p>CONFIRMED THIS INFORMATION, EXPLAINING THAT THE </p><p>EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE HAD NOT DECIDED ON THE DATE OR THE </p><p>MEANS TO CONDUCT MASS ACTION.  THE MDC CHAIRMAN ALSO </p><p>HINTED THAT TSVANGIRAI MAY POSTPONE HIS RETURN FROM </p><p>EUROPE UNTIL THIS EPISODE BLOWS OVER.  WE DO NOT BELIEVE </p><p>THE MDC IS ABOUT TO STRAY FROM ITS POLICY OF NON- </p><p>VIOLENCE, AND ITS DECISION TO POSTPONE MASS ACTION IS A </p><p>GOOD INDICATION OF THIS.  WE THINK OUR MESSAGE HAS BEEN </p><p>RECEIVED AND TAKEN TO HEART.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>MCDONALD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
