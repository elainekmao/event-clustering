<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HONG KONG 008575 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL:09/24/09 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, CH, HK, TW, US, PINR </p><p>SUBJECT:  PROMINENT HK JOURNALIST: CHINA\'S ARMY WANTS </p><p>A FIGHT, HU JINTAO\'S FUTURE MURKY </p><p> </p><p>(U)  CLASSIFIED BY E/P CHIEF LISA KUBISKE.  REASON 1.5 </p><p>(B). </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p>1.  (C) LONG-TIME CHINA REPORTER WILLY WO-LAP LAM </p><p>RECENTLY DESCRIBED AN INSULAR CHINESE MILITARY </p><p>LEADERSHIP THAT INCREASINGLY HAS LOOKED TO LIMITED </p><p>ARMED CONFLICT WITH TAIWAN AS A MEANS TO RESTORING THE </p><p>ARMY\'S PRESTIGE.  HE ADDED THAT VICE PRESIDENT HU </p><p>JINTAO WAS OUT OF FAVOR WITH PRESIDENT JIANG ZEMIN </p><p>BECAUSE OF HIS POOR HANDLING OF THE ACCIDENTAL BOMBING </p><p>OF THE CHINESE EMBASSY IN BELGRADE AND BY HAVING A </p><p>RELATIONSHIP WITH A YOUNG WOMAN.  JIANG, LAM SAID, HAD </p><p>CONSEQUENTLY JUDGED HU UNWORTHY OF SUCCEEDING HIM AS </p><p>CHINA\'S TOP LEADER.  LAM ALSO ASSERTED THAT JIANG </p><p>ZEMIN HAS PROTECTED THE CAREER OF DING GUANGEN AND </p><p>OTHER FORMER MEMBERS OF DENG XIAOPING\'S OFFICE IN THE </p><p>HOPE OF ENJOYING SIMILAR TREATMENT FOR JIANG\'S </p><p>PROTEGES FOLLOWING HIS DEPARTURE.  THE DISCUSSION ALSO </p><p>SHED SOME LIGHT ON LAM\'S ADMITTEDLY SPOTTY TRACK </p><p>RECORD READING THE TEA LEAVES IN BEIJING.  HE NOTED </p><p>THAT HIS SOURCES AT TIMES HAVE FED HIM STORIES </p><p>DESIGNED TO SPIN MORE THAN INFORM.  LAM COMPLAINED, </p><p>MOREOVER, OF HIS INABILITY TO CONFIRM OR DENY A STORY </p><p>WITH BEIJING AUTHORITIES BEFORE GOING TO PRESS.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) A FREE-WHEELING LUNCH DISCUSSION ON SEPTEMBER </p><p>14 WITH WILLY WO-LAP LAM OF HONG KONG\'S LEADING </p><p>ENGLISH LANGUAGE DAILY, THE SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST, </p><p>PROVIDED SOME DETAIL LACKING IN LAM\'S RECENT REPORTING </p><p>ON CHINESE POLITICS.  WHEN ASKED ABOUT RECENT PRESS </p><p>REPORTS OF HIGH-RANKING PLA OFFICERS SPYING FOR </p><p>TAIWAN, LAM SAID HIS SOURCES HAVE TOLD HIM MANY </p><p>OFFICERS INCREASINGLY HAVE SEEN SOME FORM OF LIMITED </p><p>MILITARY ACTION AGAINST TAIWAN AS AN ATTRACTIVE </p><p>SOLUTION TO THE ARMY\'S SEEMINGLY ENDLESS STREAM OF </p><p>PUBLIC HUMILIATION.  ACCORDING TO LAM\'S SOURCES, THE </p><p>ARMY MIGHT ATTACK ONE OF THE TAIWAN-HELD ISLANDS IN </p><p>THE TAIWAN STRAIT THEN WITHDRAW.  LAM SAYS OFFICERS </p><p>WHO FAVOR SUCH ACTION HAVE SAID AN ATTACK WOULD </p><p>RESTORE THE ARMY\'S TARNISHED IMAGE AND LEGITIMACY, </p><p>YIELD INCREASED MILITARY FUNDING, AND LEAD TO </p><p>PROMOTIONS FOR OFFICERS WHO HAVE NOT SEEN COMBAT SINCE </p><p>THE BORDER SKIRMISHES WITH VIETNAM IN THE 1980S.  WHEN </p><p>POLOFFS REMARKED THAT ANY SUCH MOVE WOULD BE </p><p>DISASTROUS FOR CHINA, LAM SAID THAT HIS CONTACTS HAVE </p><p>TOLD HIM THAT MANY OFFICERS FROM THE TOP TO THE BOTTOM </p><p>OF THE CHAIN OF COMMAND WERE ILL-INFORMED ABOUT </p><p>INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS AND EITHER DID NOT UNDERSTAND OR </p><p>DID NOT CARE ABOUT THE FOREIGN POLICY OR ECONOMIC </p><p>IMPLICATIONS OF THEIR ACTIONS.  LAM SAID, HOWEVER, </p><p>THAT THE ARMY COULD NOT DECIDE TO GO TO WAR WITHOUT </p><p>CIVILIAN APROVAL.  IN ANY EVENT, HE SAID, CHINA WOULD </p><p>NOT ATTACK IF TAIWAN PRESIDENT LEE TENG-HUI\'S </p><p>SUCCESSOR IN ELECTIONS NEXT MARCH TOOK A LOW-KEY </p><p>APPROACH TO LEE\'S "TWO STATES THEORY"; A RETRACTION </p><p>WOULD NOT BE NECESSARY.  THE ARMY WOULD BE WATCHING </p><p>AND WAITING UNTIL THEN. </p><p> </p><p>LEADERSHIP TIDBITS </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) LAM FREQUENTLY PEPPERED THE CONVERSATION WITH </p><p>INFORMATION HE HAS KEPT OUT OF PRINT.  FOR EXAMPLE, HE </p><p>DECLARED WITHOUT PROMPTING THAT VICE PRESIDENT HU </p><p>JINTAO HAD SCANDALIZED JIANG ZEMIN BY CARRYING ON A </p><p>RELATIONSHIP WITH A CHINESE CENTRAL TELEVISION NEWS </p><p>ANCHORWOMAN IN HER TWENTIES -- YOUNGER THAN HU\'S OWN </p><p>DAUGHTER.  LAM CITED THIS AS AN EXAMPLE OF WHY JIANG </p><p>HAD DECIDED THAT HU "DEFINITELY" WOULD NOT SUCCEED HIM </p><p>AS THE "CORE" OF THE NEXT GENERATION OF CHINESE </p><p>LEADERS.  HE ADDED WITHOUT ELABORATION THAT, BASED ON </p><p>HU\'S HANDLING OF THE ACCIDENTAL BOMBING OF CHINA\'S </p><p>BELGRADE EMBASSY, JIANG NOW BELIEVED THE VICE </p><p>PRESIDENT WAS TOO WEAK TO SUCCEED HIM.  THUS, JIANG </p><p>WOULD STAY ON FOR ANOTHER TERM, OR STEP DOWN BUT </p><p>REMAIN IN CONTROL WITH PLIANT FIGUREHEADS HOLDING THE </p><p>FORMAL LEADERSHIP POSITIONS.  (COMMENT: THIS LINE </p><p>PROVIDED A TIDY WAY FOR LAM TO COVER HIMSELF WHEN HU </p><p>WAS NAMED CENTRAL MILITARY COMMISSION VICE CHAIRMAN ON </p><p>SEPTEMBER 22.  END COMMENT.)  IN PRINT THE NEXT DAY, </p><p>THIS TIME CITING A "DIPLOMATIC SOURCE," LAM BRIEFLY </p><p>REFERRED TO A SCANDAL INVOLVING AN UNNAMED "FOURTH </p><p>GENERATION LEADER" AND HIS TELEVISION NEWSCASTER </p><p>MISTRESS BUT LEFT OUT THE REST OF THE DETAILS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) AS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF LAM\'S UNPROMPTED </p><p>ASSERTIONS, HE SAID THAT JIANG ZEMIN WAS A BUDDHIST, </p><p>THOUGH AN "UNORTHODOX" ONE.  LAM CLAIMED ONE OF HIS </p><p>BEIJING SOURCES TOLD HIM THAT LAST LUNAR NEW YEAR </p><p>JIANG GOT UP AT THREE IN THE MORNING AND DROVE TWO </p><p>HOURS OUT OF BEIJING TO ATTEND A BUDDHIST CEREMONY AT </p><p>AN UNNAMED TEMPLE.  HE ADDED THAT JIANG WENT TO VISIT </p><p>DAOIST SAGES AT "WUDAN MOUNTAIN" FOLLOWING THE </p><p>ACCIDENTAL BOMBING IN BELGRADE AND SPENT AN HOUR </p><p>DISCUSSING "MATTERS OF STATE" WITH A DAOIST PRIEST. </p><p>(COMMENT: THOUGH HE DID NOT SAY SO, PERHAPS LAM WAS </p><p>DESCRIBING WHAT HE SEES AS JIANG\'S POTENTIAL </p><p>VULNERABILITY IN THE PARTY\'S ONGOING CRACKDOWN ON </p><p>SPIRITUAL PRACTICES.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) LAM ALSO STATED UNEQUIVOCALLY, BEFORE WRITING </p><p>ABOUT RUMORS TO THE CONTRARY, THAT PROPAGANDA CHIEF </p><p>DING GUANGEN WOULD STAY IN HIS POST.  LAM SAID HIS </p><p>SOURCES MADE CLEAR THAT DING WAS HATED "BY EVERYONE" </p><p>IN BEIJING BUT THAT JIANG WOULD PROTECT DING ON THE </p><p>ADVICE OF HIS MENTOR WANG DAOHAN.  ACCORDING TO LAM, </p><p>WANG WARNED THAT DING -- LIKE CMC MEMBER WANG RUILIN - </p><p>- WAS CONSIDERED ONE OF DENG XIAOPING\'S STAFF AND </p><p>THEREFORE MUST BE PROTECTED IF JIANG WANTED THE SAME </p><p>CONSIDERATION TO BE GIVEN TO HIS PROTEGES ONCE HE </p><p>RETIRES. </p><p> </p><p>UNRELIABLE SOURCES </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) IN ANSWERING POLOFFS\' QUESTIONS ABOUT </p><p>DEADLINES AND PRESS TIMES IN HONG KONG, LAM COMMENTED </p><p>THAT HIS STORIES DON\'T PAN OUT AT TIMES BECAUSE HIS </p><p>SOURCES SOMETIMES FLOAT STORIES AS TRIAL BALLOONS OR </p><p>TO SATISFY SOME OTHER AGENDA.  GIVEN LAM\'S TIGHT </p><p>DEADLINE AND HIS INABILITY TO CONTACT CHINESE </p><p>OFFICIALS DIRECTLY TO CONFIRM STORIES, HE SAID HE CAN </p><p>BE WRONG SOMETIMES. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) POLOFFS FOUND LAM TO BE A CAGEY BUT TALKATIVE </p><p>INTERLOCUTOR WHO APPEARS GENUINE IN HIS DESIRE TO TELL </p><p>A GOOD NEWS STORY; HIS IS NO "DRUDGE REPORT."  BUT HIS </p><p>REPORTING DOES NOT APPEAR TO MEET U.S. JOURNALISTIC </p><p>STANDARDS OF SOURCING EITHER, AND SHOULD BE READ WITH </p><p>THAT IN MIND.  MOREOVER, LAM REPORTS FROM A PLACE </p><p>WHERE STORIES CAN TAKE ON A LIFE OF THEIR OWN, AND </p><p>WHERE IT CAN BE HARD TO DISTINGUISH CORROBORATION FROM </p><p>REPETITION OF THE SAME RUMOR OR OUTRIGHT SPIN.  FOR </p><p>EXAMPLE, IN A SEPARATE MEETING LAST WEEK WITH POLOFF, </p><p>LI LIANSHENG, A RESEARCH FELLOW AT HONG KONG\'S XINHUA </p><p>NEWS AGENCY -- AND APPARENT "BARBARIAN HANDLER" FOR </p><p>XINHUA HONG KONG CHIEF JIANG ENZHU -- ECHOED LAM\'S </p><p>RECENTLY PUBLISHED STORIES ABOUT PREMIER ZHU RONGJI\'S </p><p>DECLINING POWER.  LI SAID HE HAD EVEN HEARD NEW RUMORS </p><p>THAT ZHU MAY STEP DOWN AFTER THE OCTOBER 1 NATIONAL </p><p>DAY CELEBRATIONS.  LI ATTRIBUTED ZHU\'S SUPPOSED FALL </p><p>TO HIS "TOO SOFT" APPROACH IN DEALING WITH THE </p><p>FALUNGONG MOVEMENT.  POLOFFS SUSPECT THAT LI\'S LINE </p><p>WAS INTENDED TO BOLSTER HIS PLEAS FOR THE UNITED </p><p>STATES TO "DO MORE" TO HELP IMPROVE SINO-U.S. </p><p>RELATIONS -- LIKE DEEMPHASIZING CHINA\'S HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>RECORD -- LEST REFORMERS LIKE ZHU PAY THE PRICE FOR </p><p>APPEARING WEAK IN DEALING WITH THE UNITED STATES. </p><p>SOME OF LAM\'S BEIJING SOURCES MAY HAVE TOLD HIM </p><p>SIMILAR STORIES ABOUT ZHU AND HU JINTAO TO FURTHER THE </p><p>SAME AGENDA.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>KLOSSON </p><p></p></div>
