<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 004864 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>FSI FOR DIRECTOR KATHY PETERSON AND LISA FOX/ED KASKA </p><p>USTR FOR SAUMS/BELL </p><p>USDOC FOR 4520/ITA/MAC/ONE/PTHANOS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, BEXP, PREL, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDAN\'S DIPLOMATS FOCUS ON TRADE AND INVESTMENT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED. </p><p> </p><p>1.  (sbu)  Summary.  Reflecting the emphasis he has put </p><p>on economic and commercial development and the growing </p><p>private sector export and investment orientation of </p><p>Jordan\'s economy, King Abdullah personally launched a </p><p>four-day USAID-supported economic/commercial training </p><p>program for Jordanian ambassadors on August 14.  This </p><p>follows a decision by the king to reorient the work of </p><p>Jordan\'s ambassadors, who have traditionally focused on </p><p>political and cultural activities, toward increased </p><p>support for Jordan\'s business community -- as symbolized </p><p>by the appointment of prominent businessman Karim Kawar </p><p>as ambassador to the United States.  The foreign ministry </p><p>is planning to follow up with a broader econ/commercial </p><p>training initiative for all of Jordan\'s diplomatic corps. </p><p>End summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>King Opens Investment Promotion Forum </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (sbu)  On August 14, King Abdullah officially opened </p><p>a four-day conference designed to train and encourage </p><p>Jordanian ambassadors to increase their focus on </p><p>promoting investment and trade.  The August 13-16 </p><p>program, which had low-profile funding support from </p><p>USAID\'s AMIR program, included short modules on the roles </p><p>of Jordan\'s various trade promotion agencies (JIB, </p><p>JEDCO).  In addition, respective economic ministers gave </p><p>presentations on the work of the ministries of trade, </p><p>telecom, finance, and planning.  The Charge gave a well- </p><p>received presentation on opportunities for Jordanian </p><p>ambassadors to use the U.S.-Jordan FTA to promote </p><p>Jordanian trade as well as inward and outward investment. </p><p>The EU charge gave a similar presentation. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (u)  The program also featured familiarization visits </p><p>to Jordan\'s largest industrial estate, a Qualified </p><p>Industrial Zone (QIZ), and a tour of the new Aqaba </p><p>Special Economic Zone, in an effort to enthuse the </p><p>assembled ambassadors about the kingdom\'s most promising </p><p>export sectors and its comparative advantages as an </p><p>investment destination.  Ambassadors by and large came </p><p>away energized about promoting investment in their </p><p>countries of responsibility, and the program was deemed a </p><p>success by both foreign ministry reps and by the palace\'s </p><p>economic unit, which organized the program. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>King Heralds New Focus for Ambassadors </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (sbu)  This first-of-its-kind program was an </p><p>outgrowth of the king\'s desire to have ambassadors abroad </p><p>do more commercial work.  An indication of this shift was </p><p>the king\'s appointment of Karim Kawar, a successful IT </p><p>entrepreneur with no previous government experience, to </p><p>be Jordan\'s ambassador in Washington.  According to </p><p>Kawar, the king told him upon his appointment:  "You </p><p>focus on trade and investment promotion; handling the </p><p>political relationship is my job."  Kawar said the king </p><p>instructed him that his first responsibility would be to </p><p>create success stories from the FTA. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (u)  The king reiterated this message to all his </p><p>ambassadors during the opening.  To encourage this new </p><p>focus, the king announced that, starting in 2003, the </p><p>palace would present an award to the ambassador with the </p><p>most impressive economic performance each year.  He </p><p>highlighted the expanding role of Jordan\'s private sector </p><p>as the motor of economic growth. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (sbu)  This program is further evidence of the </p><p>seriousness with which the king and Jordan treat economic </p><p>and commercial issues.  In addition to the USAID support, </p><p>the embassy\'s econ section worked with the foreign </p><p>ministry and the king\'s economic advisor to design the </p><p>program.  As part of our ongoing effort to press ahead </p><p>with effective implementation of the FTA, we will </p><p>encourage similar training activities in the future with </p><p>segments devoted to the FTA.  In the short term, we will </p><p>continue to follow-up with the palace and ministry by 1) </p><p>providing information on the State Department\'s Cobb </p><p>Award, and 2) working with them to design a broader trade </p><p>and investment promotion training program for Jordanian </p><p>diplomats, which will be led by the foreign ministry\'s </p><p>Diplomatic Institute.  We will continue our initial </p><p>discussions with NFATC regarding its possible help in </p><p>developing such a program. </p><p>Berry </p><p></p></div>
