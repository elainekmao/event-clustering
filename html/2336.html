(SBU) SEVERAL HCMC PROTESTANT "HOUSE CHURCH" LEADERS </p><p>TOLD POLOFF ON DECEMBER 19, THAT LOCAL POLICE HAD </p><p>CALLED THEM IN INDIVIDUALLY DURING THE WEEK OF DECEMBER </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HO CHI  01411  211152Z </p><p>9, TO WARN THEM NOT TO USE CHRISTMAS AS AN OPPORTUNITY </p><p>TO "CAUSE PROBLEMS FOR THE GOVERNMENT."  THE PROTESTANT </p><p>LEADERS SAID THEY INTERPRETED THIS WARNING NOT AS A </p><p>PROHIBITION ON RELIGIOUS CHRISTMAS GATHERINGS, BUT </p><p>RATHER AS A CAUTION NOT TO CRITICIZE THE GOVERNMENT AT </p><p>ANY LARGE PUBLIC GATHERINGS AT CHRISTMAS TIME.  THEY </p><p>EXPECT TO GO AHEAD WITH A PLANNED GATHERING OF UP TO </p><p>1000 PROTESTANTS AT A CATHOLIC CHURCH IN THE CITY WHOSE </p><p>PRIESTS HAVE AGREED TO LET THEM "BORROW" THE CHURCH FOR </p><p>THE PROTESTANT CHRISTMAS SERVICE. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) THE PROTESTANT LEADERS WERE AWARE THAT ON </p><p>DECEMBER 11, SEVERAL PROTESTANT PASTORS FROM VIETNAM\'S </p><p>CENTRAL HIGHLANDS WERE SUMMONED TO HANOI TO HEAR A </p><p>SIMILAR WARNING.  THE VIETNAM NEWS AGENCY REPORTED THAT </p><p>NATIONAL ASSEMBLY SPEAKER NGUYEN VAN AN HAD ASKED THE </p><p>PASTORS TO "CONVEY HIS MERRY CHRISTMAS WISHES TO THE </p><p>PROTESTANT COMMUNITY IN THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS," BUT </p><p>ALSO WARNED THEM TO "STAY VIGILANT AND FIGHT BAD </p><p>ELEMENTS WHO ABUSE RELIGION TO UNDERMINE NATIONAL </p><p>UNITY."   SEPARATELY, A RELIABLE PROTESTANT SOURCE TOLD </p><p>EMBASSY POLOFF THAT THE GVN COMMITTEE ON RELIGION HAD </p><p>SUMMONED SIX CENTRAL HIGHLAND ETHNIC MINORITY LEADERS </p><p>OF THE RECENTLY LEGALIZED SOUTHERN EVANGELICAL CHURCH </p><p>OF VIETNAM TO HANOI FROM DECEMBER 7-16 FOR MEETINGS </p><p>WITH VARIOUS GVN OFFICIALS. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) THE MONTAGNARD FOUNDATION, INC., BASED IN </p><p>SOUTH CAROLINA, PUT OUT A PRESS RELEASE THAT INCLUDED A </p><p>PLEA TO PRESIDENT BUSH AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY </p><p>TO MONITOR AN EVENT IN THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS WHERE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HO CHI  01411  211152Z </p><p>"HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF HILL TRIBE MONTAGNARDS WILL </p><p>UNITE IN A PEACEFUL PRAYER VIGIL TO CELEBRATE CHRISTMAS </p><p>AND CALL FOR AN END TO MARTIAL LAW BY HANOI\'S COMMUNIST </p><p>AUTHORITIES AND TO RESPECT HUMAN RIGHTS AND RELIGIOUS </p><p>FREEDOM IN VIETNAM."

(COMMENT: </p><p>POST BELIEVES IT IS HIGHLY UNLIKELY THE ETHNIC MINORITY </p><p>PROTESTANTS COULD ORGANIZE A SIMILARLY LARGE GATHERING </p><p>THIS CHRISTMAS BECAUSE OF THE CONTINUING EMPHASIS ON </p><p>SECURITY BY PROVINCIAL AND DISTRICT AUTHORITIES IN THE </p><p>AREA.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) THE HCMC PROTESTANT LEADERS SAID THEY HAVE </p><p>HEARD FROM PROTESTANT PASTORS IN OTHER PROVINCES WHO </p><p>HAVE ALSO BEEN WARNED NOT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF </p><p>CHRISTMAS TO "CAUSE PROBLEMS."  THEY SAID THEY WERE </p><p>UNAWARE OF ANY PLANNED LARGE GATHERING IN THE CENTRAL </p><p>HIGHLANDS.  THEY EMPHASIZED THAT THEIR OWN CHRISTMAS </p><p>SERVICE IN HCMC WILL BE A RELIGIOUS CELEBRATION AND </p><p>WILL NOT TOUCH ON POLITICS IN ANY WAY. </p><p> </p><p>YAMAUCHI </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
