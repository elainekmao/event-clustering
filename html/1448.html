<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KINSHASA 008532 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/23/2010 </p><p>TAGS: CG, PINS, PREL, ECON PGOV </p><p>SUBJECT: KISANGANI OBSERVATIONS AND IMPRESSIONS </p><p> </p><p> CLASSIFIED BY WILLIAM LACY SWING FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) (D) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) The following two-part series reports on Embassy staff </p><p>member\'s recent visit to Kisangani, capitol of Oriental </p><p>Province.  Part one addresses the military and security </p><p>situation, and Part two the political and economic issues </p><p>facing Kisangani and the province. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Summary: During visit to Kisangani November 28 to </p><p>December 1, Emboff spoke to local businessmen, </p><p>representatives of international and local NGOs, and MONUC </p><p>officers.  Although Kisangani has been calm for months, there </p><p>has been fighting recently between RCD/Goma and MLC only </p><p>sixty kilometers north of Kisangani.  Most viewed the </p><p>situation as still inherently unstable and precarious, as </p><p>access to diamond-rich areas appears to be a major objective </p><p>of the different local military and political actors.  The </p><p>"governor" of Oriental Province emphasized support of the </p><p>Lusaka Peace Agreement, the Inter-Congolese Dialogue, and </p><p>Congolese territorial integrity.  He urged the international </p><p>community to pay more attention to Kisangani given its </p><p>isolation and desperate economic situation, implying that </p><p>there was a tendency to favor Goma and Bukavu.  The </p><p>"governor" said that the USG could stop the war if it only </p><p>wanted to.  Civil society reps say the "governor" has only </p><p>very limited support in Goma. </p><p>      Nearly all interlocutors in Kisangani had two </p><p>complaints: (a) that the city had become completely isolated; </p><p>and (b) that the province as a whole had been "balkanized" to </p><p>a regrettably large extent. Travel around the province was </p><p>virtually impossible, the province having become divided into </p><p>many small "spheres of influence."  These divisions had </p><p>resulted in Kisangani\'s trade and communications options </p><p>being cut off eastward as well as westward.  Within the city, </p><p>the problems of Hema-Lendu tension and NGO tax harassment </p><p>were cited. </p><p>     The economy of Kisangani is in fairly dire straits, as </p><p>both eastern and western surface supply routes have been </p><p>completely cut and diamond trading has moved northward out of </p><p>the city.  What little goods Kisangani is able to import come </p><p>only via small planes from the east, or, in the case of </p><p>agricultural produce, by canoe and bicycle.  Most of the </p><p>diamond producing areas remain in MLC territory, and now that </p><p>the Ugandans have moved north of Kisangani, this trade </p><p>bypasses Kisangani, passing to Kampala via more northern </p><p>routes.  As the diamond trade has been the basis for </p><p>Kisangani\'s economy for some time now, the city\'s economy has </p><p>collapsed, and money is in extremely short supply. </p><p>     Civil Society members expressed gratitude to the US </p><p>Embassy in Kinshasa for having issued them documents which </p><p>facilitated their return to rebel areas after attending a </p><p>civil society conference in Kinshasa earlier in the year. </p><p>They were also appreciative that someone from the American </p><p>government had visited, and hoped that this was the beginning </p><p>of a closer relationship.  Finally, they were extremely </p><p>gratified to learn that the US Embassy was very actively </p><p>supporting the idea of the establishment of a "humanitarian </p><p>corridor" along the Congo River between Kisangani and </p><p>Mbandaka.  People proposed that in addition, an extremely </p><p>beneficial and possibly more practical interim measure would </p><p>be to broker the opening up of Kisangani and Goma airports to </p><p>commercial and humanitarian traffic, an initiative that could </p><p>potentially be monitored by MONUC.  End Summary </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Military/Security Situation </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>     3. (C) Kisangani has not seen any combat in the city </p><p>proper since the withdrawal of Rwandan and Ugandan regular </p><p>troops, after three violent confrontations between them in </p><p>August 1999, and May and June 2000.  Notwithstanding, all </p><p>agree that the security situation remains precarious and that </p><p>a new round of fighting could break out again at any time--at </p><p>least between MLC and RCD troops, if not by their respective </p><p>Ugandan and Rwandan backers. (The population was seriously </p><p>traumatized by the fighting earlier this year and remains </p><p>very jumpy-ready to run into the forest with the first sound </p><p>of gunshots.) </p><p>     According to MONUC, both Rwandan and Ugandan armies have </p><p>withdrawn to distances some 100 km from the city of </p><p>Kisangani, in compliance with accords to this effect. </p><p>However, as RCD/Goma-appointed authorities continue to </p><p>administer Kisangani and the military force in and around the </p><p>city are "RCD/Goma" troops, Rwanda maintains considerable </p><p>influence in the city.  The local population, in fact, </p><p>believes that many of the "RCD" troops are actually borrowed </p><p>RPA soldiers.  They claim to see increasing numbers of </p><p>obviously Tutsi soldiers, especially in the local drinking </p><p>spots that used to be highly frequented by RPA soldiers when </p><p>they were living openly in the town.  Kisangani residents </p><p>have difficulty accepting that all these could possibly be </p><p>"Banyamulenge" (or other Congolese Tutsis) as the RCD claims. </p><p> Uniforms are of little help in distinguishing soldiers of </p><p>the different armies at this point, since many RCD troops </p><p>have now been issued RPA-type uniforms.  Having no way of </p><p>knowing who is Congolese and who isn\'t, MONUC officers say </p><p>they have to accept the RCD\'s explanation that these Tutsi </p><p>soldiers are Congolese and thus legitimate RCD regulars. </p><p>     MONUC and local Civil Society groups assert that in many </p><p>ways, the population was better off under foreign (Rwandan </p><p>RPA and Ugandan UPDF) army control.  RPA and UPDF soldiers </p><p>were regularly paid, relatively well disciplined, and </p><p>supervised by a professional officer corps.  During that </p><p>period, the unpaid, less-well supervised and relatively </p><p>undisciplined RCD did not carry weapons.  The RCD troops </p><p>were, however, issued arms by the RPA at the time of the </p><p>RPA\'s withdrawal, and RCD soldiers now largely live off the </p><p>population, confiscating food and other goods at will, </p><p>especially in supply areas just outside the city. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>     4.(C) RCD and MLC Clash </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>     In mid-November, RCD and MLC armies clashed north of </p><p>Kisangani, on the road to Banalia and Buta.  There were </p><p>reportedly three casualties and some wounded.  RCD forces </p><p>captured approximately fourteen MLC policeman.  The </p><p>skirmishes were apparently the result of an effort by RCD </p><p>troops to extend RCD control to Bengamisa, a town 48 </p><p>kilometers from Kisangani and some 18 kilometers beyond the </p><p>village of Lindi (which had hitherto served as the border </p><p>areas of RCD control and MLC control).  According to MONUC, </p><p>whoever controls the Bengamisa-Yangambi road is likely to be </p><p>able to control diamond traffic from the diamond-rich area </p><p>just north of Yangambi (approximately 100 kilometers west of </p><p>Kisangani). </p><p>     Some three hundred RCD troops, many of whom are Tutsi </p><p>(and believed by the population to be RPA soldiers) suddenly </p><p>moved considerably north of the city of Kisangani and crossed </p><p>a river into the area north of Linda--normally territory </p><p>controlled by MLC police.  Capturing MLC police on the other </p><p>side of the river in a surprise attack, the RCD troops </p><p>proceeded northward to capture Bengamisa, also protected only </p><p>by MLC police and headed toward Balaia on the Aruwini River. </p><p>At kilometer 62, however, they encountered the MLC army, </p><p>which headed southward from Banalia upon learning of the </p><p>invasion.  Some fighting ensued and went on intermittently </p><p>for two days.  MONUC, which was able to reach the area of the </p><p>fighting by the second day, had the impression that there had </p><p>already been meetings between commanders on both sides and </p><p>that some kind of a cease-fire/pull-back agreement had been </p><p>reached.  This may have resulted from MONUC\'s earlier </p><p>communications with RCD/Goma and MLC/Gbadolite alerting their </p><p>respective leaders of the fighting and high potential for </p><p>another catastrophic clash of rebel and supporting foreign </p><p>armies.  RPA and UPDF troops reportedly remained at a </p><p>considerable distance throughout the conflict and did not </p><p>participate in these skirmishes.  In the pull-back agreement, </p><p>however, RCD appears to have retained control of Benganisa, </p><p>the town which may have been their original objective in the </p><p>offensive.  MONUC and the population thus wonder whether the </p><p>MLC might not as some point try to recover this territory and </p><p>retaliate in an offensive. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Local Attitudes Toward MONUC </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>     There is considerable concern among the international </p><p>NGO community that MONUC will not be able to help them much </p><p>if real trouble breaks out.  MONUC still has only thirty-five </p><p>people in Kisangani, and they do not attempt to monitor the </p><p>left bank of the river at all.  Some residents\' perception of </p><p>MONUC as doing little to free Kisangani from rebel occupation </p><p>leads them to the false conclusion that MONUC favors the RCD </p><p>and Rwanda.  MONUC troops were not very visible in October </p><p>when the university students went on a rampage in the city </p><p>over school fees (which included throwing rocks at some of </p><p>the headquarters of international NGOs.)  The international </p><p>NGO community found itself largely on its own to attempt to </p><p>ascertain what was happening. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SWING </p><p></p></div>
