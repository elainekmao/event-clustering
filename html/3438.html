<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001783 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR INR/R/MR, AF/PD, AF/S </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KMDR, PREL, KPAO, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION DRC PEACE PROCESS; HARARE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   An editorial published in the August 4 edition of the </p><p>      independent weekly "The Sunday Mirror" and an opinion peace </p><p>      published in the August 3 edition of government-controlled </p><p>      daily "The Herald" focus on the recent signing of the peace </p><p>      deal between the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and </p><p>      Rwanda.  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   Under headline "DRC peace pact: The cleansing of </p><p>      Rwanda?" the independent weekly "The Sunday Mirror" (08/04) </p><p>      comments: </p><p> </p><p>      ". . .Sadly, neither the Lusaka Accord nor the Sun </p><p>      City Agreement managed to stop the DRC conflict, and </p><p>      in both cases Rwanda and its surrogate forces, the </p><p>      rebel group RCD-Goma, continued to fuel the crisis. </p><p>      Now that there is an agreement, which specifically </p><p>      addresses Rwanda\'s security concerns, many </p><p>      commentators have expressed the hope that peace will </p><p>      come to the DRC at last.  The question though, is, </p><p>      why put so much effort in appeasing Rwanda when it </p><p>      is so clear that they are the aggressors. . .?  It </p><p>      should therefore be made clear from the beginning, </p><p>      that by signing the Pretoria agreement, Rwanda is </p><p>      not automatically absolved of the horrors that it </p><p>      perpetrated in the DRC.  The case before the </p><p>      International Court of Justice must still be heard, </p><p>      and Rwanda must still pay reparations to the DRC for </p><p>      the invasion and for all the suffering it caused. </p><p>      Also, now that the DRC is on the road to peace, the </p><p>      international community should now focus on Rwanda. </p><p>      Why has this small country caused so much suffering </p><p>      not only to its own people in the 1994 genocide, but </p><p>      also in the DRC since 1998?  There is a clear need </p><p>      for internal soul searching in Rwanda.  An </p><p>      Inter-Rwandese Dialogue may not be a bad idea after </p><p>      all!" </p><p> </p><p>  3.   Under headline "Signing of accord set to bring peace </p><p>      to DRC" the government-controlled daily "The Herald" </p><p>      (08/03) carried the following op-ed by Tim Chigodo: </p><p> </p><p>      "The people of the DRC should feel relieved </p><p>      following the signing of a peace accord to end the </p><p>      four-year devastating war in the Great Lakes region. </p><p>      The peace agreement signed by President Joseph </p><p>      Kabila of the DRC and President Paul Kagame of </p><p>      Rwanda in South Africa on July 30 after marathon </p><p>      negotiations should finally bring the brutal war, in </p><p>      which more than 2 million people have been killed </p><p>      and several others displaced, to an end.  Although </p><p>      some analysts are wary of the success of the accord </p><p>      following the failure of the Lusaka agreement, the </p><p>      commitment shown by the DRC and Rwanda leaders now </p><p>      should lead to cessation of hostilities. . .Other </p><p>      analysts said the recent accord was likely to </p><p>      succeed because it had the blessing of the United </p><p>      States, France and the former colonial power Belgium </p><p>      who have in the past created problems.  Political </p><p>      sources close to the deal said the three countries </p><p>      had pledged support for the recent peace </p><p>      agreement. . .Until a lasting solution to the DRC </p><p>      war is found, peace cannot be guaranteed in southern </p><p>      Africa. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>WHITEHEAD </p><p></p></div>
