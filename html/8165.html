The situation in northern Iraq remains calm.  CMOC and other </p><p>sources project that approximately 100,000 IDPs will start </p><p>returning from major cities in Kurdish-controlled Iraq to areas </p><p>recently controlled by the former regime once the harvest and </p><p>school seasons are completed.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>DART VISIT TO MAKHMUR </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  The Ministry of Reconstruction and Development (MORAD) </p><p>coordinated a visit to communities in southern Arbil Governorate </p><p>for DART Field Team North, the Civil Military Operations Center </p><p>(CMOC), non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and U.N. agencies. </p><p>This region, referred to in Arbil as "newly liberated," was under </p><p>the control of the former Government of Iraq (GOI). </p><p> </p><p>3.  In previous meetings with the humanitarian aid community in </p><p>Arbil, the Minister and others in the Kurdish Regional Government </p><p>(KRG) promoted a development plan for approximately 40 villages </p><p>that were evacuated and destroyed during the past 40 years. </p><p>These villages are now being repopulated by Kurdish returnees. </p><p> </p><p>4.  The Arabs who were moved into some of these communities by </p><p>the GOI have now abandoned the villages, or so it appears.  Some </p><p>Kurdish internally displaced persons (IDPs) previously residing </p><p>in Arbil, have begun returning to their villages.  In most cases, </p><p>when the Kurdish villages were "Arabized", they were destroyed </p><p>and the new Arab villages were built nearby.  The Kurds were sent </p><p>to collective towns or became IDPs in the Kurdish-controlled </p><p>areas.  It is important to note that there was a significant </p><p>population of Arabs who lived in the region independent of </p><p>"Arabization" programs and have remained in their villages. </p><p> </p><p>5.  The DART visited the Gwer sub-district of Arbil.  Located on </p><p>wheat- and barley-covered plains sloping toward Baghdad, the </p><p>villages in Gwer are hot, dry, and dusty.  Homes are made of mud </p><p>and straw, and there are few trees.  Public services are minimal. </p><p>KRG officials claim that the region was neglected by the former </p><p>regime because it was Kurdish, although there are Arab villages </p><p>in the region that received support from the GOI. </p><p> </p><p>6.  The DART visited several villages in the sub-district.  They </p><p>all appeared to have small numbers of returnees.  In each </p><p>village, the DART was informed that more people are preparing to </p><p>return when public services are provided.  There was a lack of </p><p>school-age children in the villages; they will remain in the </p><p>towns to finish the school year.  Employment seems to center </p><p>around animal husbandry and farming.  Previous residents planted </p><p>the large fields of wheat and barley, and it is unclear who will </p><p>harvest the crops. </p><p> </p><p>7.  Outside of the larger towns, there is no electricity.  Water </p><p>is drawn from hand-dug wells or brought in by tanker.  Well water </p><p>is dirty and saline, and wells appeared to be 15 to 20 meters </p><p>deep.  There are bore wells in some villages, but the equipment </p><p>has been looted.  There are health centers in larger villages </p><p>that serve surrounding, smaller villages.  They are poorly </p><p>equipped and staffed.  There are medical centers in the Gwer and </p><p>Makhmur district seats.  Qandil, a Swedish NGO, supports the </p><p>health center in Gwer.  The Center in Makhmur has been assessed </p><p>by several NGOs. </p><p> </p><p>8.  The DART met the Minister and the mayor in Makhmur at the </p><p>mayor\'s office.  The Minister chaired a short meeting, where the </p><p>mayor offered a brief history of the "Arabization" program.  He </p><p>solicited support from the aid community, recommending that </p><p>returnees be given tents and sources of water.  The DART </p><p>suggested that a comprehensive plan be developed for a more </p><p>orderly return. </p><p> </p><p>9.  There has also been some concern that while the returns may </p><p>be voluntary and without incident, there may be a great deal of </p><p>"encouragement" on the part of the KRG to repopulate the area </p><p>with Kurds.  Furthermore, some Arabs reported that their homes </p><p>have been looted by Kurds.  Two DART Abuse Prevention Officers </p><p>(APOs) will return to Makhmur to investigate these allegations. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>WFP MEETING IN KIRKUK </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  The DART traveled to Kirkuk on 8 May to meet with U.N. World </p><p>Food Program (WFP) local staff.  WFP staff in Kirkuk believe that </p><p>the silos and mills in the governorate are in generally good </p><p>condition, and CMOC/Kirkuk personnel believe there are around </p><p>130,000 metric tons (MT) of wheat in governorate silos, and a </p><p>300,000 MT harvest due in the area next month.   WFP also raised </p><p>concern about the shortage of fuel needed for farmers to bring </p><p>their grain to market next month.  CMOC personnel noted that the </p><p>Bayji refinery should be repaired and sufficient fuel should be </p><p>available in two weeks. </p><p> </p><p>11.  WFP/Kirkuk raised the following as the greatest constraints </p><p>to stepping up the public distribution system (PDS): 1) Security </p><p>of its warehouses (currently guarded by local security </p><p>personnel); 2) Replacement of Ministry of Trade (MOT) furniture </p><p>and equipment that had been looted.  MOT staff in both Mosul and </p><p>Kirkuk have secured disks with database information on food </p><p>agents and beneficiaries, but the offices have no computers or </p><p>other supplies; and 3) Salaries of MOT staff.  MOT staff have not </p><p>yet received the nationwide USD 20 emergency payment for </p><p>government employees, and they are concerned about when they will </p><p>receive their salaries. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>AGRICULTURE MEETINGS </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  The DART met with Ministry of Agriculture technical </p><p>personnel from the three northern provinces to discuss the major </p><p>agricultural needs in the next few months.  The biggest concern </p><p>was marketing for wheat from last year\'s crop (50,000 to 100,000 </p><p>MT) and this year\'s harvest (approximately 600,000 to 700,000 MT) </p><p>starting in the next few weeks.  If the farmers are to recoup </p><p>their investments, they will need money to pay their costs and </p><p>prepare for future crops. </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
