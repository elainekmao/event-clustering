<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 AMMAN 004086 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT PASS USAID FOR MSCOVILL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAL, EINV, EAID, PREL, IS, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: PALESTINIAN-JORDANIAN BUSINESSMEN PONDER ROLE IN </p><p>PALESTINE\'S ECONOMIC FUTURE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>Summary </p><p>------------ </p><p>1.  (SBU)  A group of Palestinian-Jordanian businesspeople </p><p>met with econoffs July 11, to discuss what they believe might </p><p>be the leading investment opportunities and economic </p><p>prospects following the establishment of a Palestinian state, </p><p>as well as the role of Palestinian-Jordanians in promoting </p><p>development in Palestine. The businesspeople outlined which </p><p>sectors were of interest to them, what conditions would be </p><p>needed to facilitate business, and what obstacles would need </p><p>to be overcome. The meeting demonstrates that despite the </p><p>ongoing conflict in Israel and the Palestinian territories, </p><p>Palestinian-Jordanian businesspeople are still convinced that </p><p>a future settlement is attainable and would provide </p><p>substantial economic opportunities </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>Opportunities </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  Palestinian-Jordanian businesspeople representing </p><p>a variety of sectors (pharmaceuticals, paints, poultry, olive </p><p>oil, QIZ textiles, real estate development, etc.) highlighted </p><p>several investment opportunities they were looking into </p><p>within Palestine, prospectively based on cooperation between </p><p>Palestine and Jordan following the establishment of an </p><p>independent Palestinian state and reduction of violence in </p><p>Israel and the West Bank.  Following months of one-on-one </p><p>commentary on the matter from contacts within the </p><p>Jordanian-Palestinian business community, Econoffs arranged </p><p>for a roundtable discussion among key contacts to spark a </p><p>broader dialogue on long-term business prospects in the West </p><p>Bank and a frank discussion of internal impediments to </p><p>investment.  The assembled businessmen included owners of </p><p>both commercial and industrial concerns, landholding and </p><p>shareholding companies, and a number of  licensees and </p><p>distributors of U.S. products/companies, with individual </p><p>business assets ranging between USD 1 million and USD 10 </p><p>million both within Jordan and in the West Bank. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  Several of the businesspeople pointed to </p><p>opportunities they had identified in food processing, </p><p>chemicals and paints, housing, and private education which </p><p>were hampered by the ongoing conflict, infrastructure </p><p>limitations, and transportation difficulties, but which would </p><p>again become attractive following establishment of a </p><p>Palestinian state. Moreover, they saw opportunities for </p><p>cooperation between Jordan and Palestine in the tourism </p><p>sector and through export-oriented mergers in the agriculture </p><p>sector. The businesspeople claimed that high wage </p><p>expectations (a result of years of enjoying the benefit of </p><p>Israeli minimum wage laws) might hinder international </p><p>competitiveness until investments in education and productive </p><p>capital bring the economy up to speed with wage expectations. </p><p> </p><p>--Real Estate/Construction: The businesspeople were </p><p>enthusiastic about the real estate sector, stating that even </p><p>now the demand and resources are there for the sector to take </p><p>off. One attendee claimed that land could be acquired for </p><p>development in exchange for a stake in anticipated returns </p><p>following construction. They claimed that with the onset of </p><p>peace and the adoption of legal instruments conducive to long </p><p>term financing and mortgages, real estate will be an </p><p>instantaneously profitable sector. </p><p> </p><p>--Agriculture/Food Processing: When discussing food related </p><p>industries, the businesspeople emphasized processing over </p><p>production, given the small scale of agriculture. One </p><p>businessman with experience in poultry suggested that with </p><p>minimal electrical infrastructure to support refrigeration, </p><p>meat processing would gain a more secure foothold in the </p><p>Palestinian market. Moreover, many saw potential for "cottage </p><p>industries" in high-end, specialty food products such as </p><p>tahini or quality olive oil and its byproducts, including </p><p>soap. </p><p> </p><p>--Private Education: Several businesspeople stated that </p><p>private education would be a major target of investment. As a </p><p>business, they said it would be supported by the Palestinian </p><p>cultural emphasis on education, families from abroad wanting </p><p>to send children back to the homeland, and a lack of serious </p><p>competition from the severely embattled established </p><p>institutions. They also mentioned partnerships with U.S. </p><p>private universities as a potentially profitable avenue for </p><p>development. </p><p> </p><p>--Tourism: Many businesspeople felt that both the West Bank </p><p>and Jordanian tourism sectors would benefit immensely from </p><p>coordinating traditional religious tours of West Bank holy </p><p>sites with tours of Jordanian destinations. Increased traffic </p><p>to Jordan,s own famous holy sites at Mount Nebo and the </p><p>newly revitalized baptism site would have knock-on benefits </p><p>for other Jordanian tourism draws like Petra and Jerash. </p><p> </p><p>--Pharmaceuticals: In one of their more improbable schemes, </p><p>they talked about the opportunity posed by the lag between </p><p>the establishment of the Palestinian state and accession to </p><p>international intellectual property agreements. Given this </p><p>window to profiteer from the production of patented </p><p>medications, one businesswoman suggested that the </p><p>infrastructure for a legitimate pharmaceuticals industry </p><p>could be financed though the profits of illicit production </p><p>(sic!). </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  Beyond identifying opportunities sector by sector, </p><p>the businesspeople suggested that the Palestinian-Jordanian </p><p>community would serve as an eager source of venture capital </p><p>for the fledgling state economy. They claimed that financial </p><p>flows from Palestinian Jordanians would mirror those of </p><p>Palestinians worldwide waiting to take money out of bank </p><p>accounts in the Caymans and Switzerland and put it into </p><p>Palestinian development. They pointed to the flood of funds </p><p>from abroad in the early days of the Oslo Agreement, </p><p>suggesting that this extreme enthusiasm for investing that </p><p>followed a temporary peace agreement would be far outstripped </p><p>by the outpouring of financial support for a newly </p><p>established state. Several businessmen even expressed an </p><p>interest in relocating current Jordanian operations to the </p><p>West Bank, moving entire businesses, not just dinars, into </p><p>the new state. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  Looking at a broader trading picture, the </p><p>businesspeople expressed their desire to keep IFTA benefits </p><p>and to extend existing US tax incentives for investment in </p><p>Israel to a new Palestinian state. They also expressed hope </p><p>that the Palestinian territories could be brought under the </p><p>US-Jordan FTA umbrella. The businessmen see an opportunity to </p><p>use the incentives for investment and special trade </p><p>relationships provided under the free trade framework to </p><p>consolidate businesses currently competing within Jordan and </p><p>the West Bank (stone, olive oil, glassware, vegetables, etc.) </p><p>into export industries targeted at the US and Israeli </p><p>markets. Additionally, they look forward to the development </p><p>of the Gaza port as an alternative to Haifa, movement into </p><p>upper-end textile production (through use of Palestinian </p><p>skilled/semi-skilled labor developed largely through past </p><p>employment in Israel), and displacing Israeli goods both </p><p>within the West Bank and in US export markets. </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>Obstacles </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  Having set aside fundamental issues of achieving a </p><p>peaceful settlement to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and </p><p>the subsequent establishment of a Palestinian state for </p><p>purposes of this discussion, the businesspeople focused </p><p>primarily on their visions for private investment and </p><p>relations between the private sector and the new state. </p><p>However, even after theoretically removing the primary </p><p>obstacles to Palestinian statehood, several additional </p><p>obstacles to economic development were identified. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU)  The businesspeople made clear that the development </p><p>of a business friendly environment in the new state would be </p><p>critical to its success in attracting private investment. </p><p>Anecdotes of the costs of PNA and municipal intrusions into </p><p>privately identified business opportunities (in dairy, </p><p>cement, and poultry) helped to drive home the central theme </p><p>of the night, the need for a strictly limited public sector. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU)  The businesspeople were highly cynical about </p><p>government involvement in the economy beyond the development </p><p>of "minimal" infrastructure (water, electricity, roads, Gaza </p><p>port etc.), going so far as to envision a new state with no </p><p>currency, a constitutional upper limit on taxation (taking </p><p>advantage of its status as a new and debtless nation), and a </p><p>transparency-inducing monitory board representing/composed of </p><p>businesspeople, NGO members, and international agencies. More </p><p>modest goals included active business associations, </p><p>government focus on fiscal soundness, and the adoption of </p><p>accounting standards to allow some degree of transparency, at </p><p>least in business. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU)  In terms of cooperation between Jordan and </p><p>Palestine, Jordanian hostility to the acquisition of </p><p>prominent Jordanian industries by Palestinian investors and </p><p>insistence on a partial (through a currency basket) adoption </p><p>of the Jordanian dinar pose a threat to the environment of </p><p>cooperation between the two nations which will be essential </p><p>to future bilateral flows of investment, according to the </p><p>businesspeople. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>The Aid Conundrum </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU)  The businesspeople argue that within Palestine </p><p>the need to develop infrastructure and the demand for basic </p><p>social services are immense, and the corresponding pressure </p><p>to raise state revenues will threaten the ability of private </p><p>businesses to keep the public sector at bay. The </p><p>businesspeople recommended that aid to the new state should </p><p>be targeted at addressing these initial hurdles rather than </p><p>at servicing future debts, so as to reduce pressures for </p><p>early growth of the public sector. These requests for public </p><p>sector aid seemed at odds with earlier statements imploring </p><p>econoffs that all future aid to the new state target the </p><p>private sector. The inconsistency suggests a disconnect </p><p>between their understanding of a fundamental demand upon the </p><p>new state to help business by supplying infrastructure and </p><p>their gut-aversion to putting any funds into the public </p><p>sector, whether through aid or taxes. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (SBU)   This meeting was seen as the first in a series </p><p>to identify opportunities, mobilize investors, and address </p><p>barriers to development in a future Palestinian state. This </p><p>discussion was an encouraging sign that </p><p>Palestinian-Jordanians are ready to look beyond the barriers </p><p>to a peaceful settlement in the short term, and have </p><p>identified ways to invest their own capital and their own </p><p>businesses in the economic future of an independent </p><p>Palestinian state. </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
