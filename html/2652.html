THE </p><p>GAZETTING OF THE ACT BRINGS IT INTO IMMEDIATE EFFECT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) COMMENT: PRESIDENT MUGABE PROBABLY WAITED UNTIL </p><p>AFTER THE ELECTION TO SIGN THE ACT BECAUSE HE DID NOT </p><p>WANT TO GIVE HIS INTERNATIONAL DETRACTORS MORE </p><p>AMMUNITION FOR TOUGH ACTION DURING HIS CAMPAIGN.  HE </p><p>ALSO KNEW THAT KEY PROVISIONS OF THE ACT WOULD NOT GO </p><p>INTO EFFECT UNTIL AFTER THE ACT WAS GAZETTED.
