<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ABU DHABI 000171 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR D/HS HOMELAND SECURITY GROUP, DS/ITA, </p><p>DS/OP/NEA, NEA/ARP, S/CT, NEA/EX, CA/VO, CA/OCS/NEASA, </p><p>AND M </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PTER, CVIS, PREL, AMGT, TC </p><p>SUBJECT: UNCLASSIFIED REPORT OF THIRD MEETING OF POST\'S </p><p>HOMELAND SECURITY WORKING GROUP </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A) ABU DHABI 96, B) 02 ABU DHABI 6017, </p><p>      C) 02 ABU DHABI 2399, D) ABU DHABI 511 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Post provides the following unclassified version </p><p>of ref a as requested by CA. </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) The UAE Mission\'s HSWG is rapidly developing </p><p>into a highly useful forum to discuss a broad range of </p><p>issues which bear on homeland security.  The pooling of </p><p>information and ideas, and the support provided by the </p><p>HSWG for the consular mission, has already been </p><p>commented upon favorably by conoffs, who feel better- </p><p>informed and less isolated as a result.  The third </p><p>monthly meeting of the HSWG provided an opportunity for </p><p>Conoffs to brief on the possibility of possible IV </p><p>fraud, particularly by Yemeni applicants here seeking to </p><p>enter the U.S. as stepchildren of U.S. citizens -- such </p><p>visas can be obtained in as little as 18 months and are </p><p>not subject to the Condor process, although they do go </p><p>through CLASS.  Concerns regarding UAE passports issued </p><p>as travel documents to non-citizens and erroneous place </p><p>of birth information for naturalized UAE citizens were </p><p>also raised, as was possible entry into CLASS of </p><p>individuals seeking to violate U.S. export control </p><p>regulations.  The Congen Dubai representative briefed on </p><p>Dubai\'s new expedited exit and entry system for </p><p>residents of that emirate which is now online at Dubai </p><p>international airport.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>MORE SECURITY FOCUS NEEDED ON IMMIGRANT VISA PROCESS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) A/DCM convened the third monthly meeting of the </p><p>UAE\'s Homeland Security Working Group (HSWG) on January </p><p>5.  Consular officers briefed the HSWG on the disparity </p><p>between the extensive Condor process for NIV applicants </p><p>of concern and the lack of similar procedures for </p><p>Immigrant Visa (IV) applicants.  In some cases, IVs can </p><p>be obtained in as little as 18 months.  Conoffs are </p><p>concerned in particular with potential fraudulent </p><p>applications for IVs here by Yemenis claiming to be the </p><p>stepchildren of U.S. citizens.  In most cases, the </p><p>claimed Amcit parent is listed as deceased, making DNA </p><p>testing impossible, and submitted documents are often of </p><p>a highly suspicious nature. </p><p> </p><p>CONCERNS REGARDING UAE PASSPORTS </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Conoffs briefed on difficulties determining </p><p>the status of holders of UAE passports, as well as the </p><p>validity of the identifying information contained in </p><p>these documents.  The UAEG has confirmed that UAE </p><p>passports are on occasion issued to non-UAE citizens as </p><p>travel documents.  These passports are not different </p><p>either in form, content or validity from the passports </p><p>issued to nationals (see refs b and d).  Furthermore, </p><p>the data contained in UAE passports -- particularly </p><p>those of naturalized citizens -- is frequently incorrect </p><p>(see ref c).  UAE naturalized citizens, for example, </p><p>will have their place of birth changed to Abu Dhabi. </p><p>This is common practice because the benefits enjoyed by </p><p>nationals depend upon the emirate from which they hail. </p><p> </p><p>OTHER ISSUES </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  Consulate Dubai representative (Consular </p><p>section chief) reported on the Dubai emirate initiative </p><p>to issue fast-track cards to residents which expedites </p><p>arrival/departure at Dubai International Airport.  The </p><p>card contains digitized passport and other data, and is </p><p>verified by an index fingerprint scanner.  While this is </p><p>in many cases a more secure means of determining </p><p>identity of a traveler than a passport, the use of the </p><p>card on arrival and departure means that there is no </p><p>record on any travel document of the comings and goings </p><p>through Dubai of the card holder -- other than that </p><p>contained in Dubai Immigration computers.  At the close </p><p>of the meeting, Foreign Commercial Service export </p><p>control officer reported on the results of several pre- </p><p>license checks. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
