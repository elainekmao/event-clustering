<p>UNCLAS FRANKFURT 000392 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, GM </p><p>SUBJECT: CAN THE CDU WIN AN ABSOLUTE MAJORITY IN THE HESSE </p><p>ELECTIONS? </p><p> </p><p>1.  The latest polls in Hesse, released January 8 and 9, put </p><p>CDU Minister-President Koch ahead of his SPD challenger </p><p>Gerhard Boekel by near 15 percentage points.  There is an </p><p>increasing possibility that the CDU could win an absolute </p><p>majority and not require any assistance from the FDP, who </p><p>may have a hard time reaching the five percent threshold in </p><p>its bid to return to parliament.  Berlin-based polling </p><p>institutes FORSA and Infratest dimap (in brackets) give the </p><p>following projections: </p><p> </p><p>CDU       47 (47) </p><p>SPD       32 (33) </p><p>Greens    12 (10) </p><p>FDP        5 ( 5) </p><p> </p><p>2.  The parties are reacting cautiously to the latest polls. </p><p>On January 9, Interior Minister Volker Bouffier (CDU) warned </p><p>that despite the CDU\'s excellent chances of winning, it </p><p>would be risky to bet on a CDU absolute majority.  "But </p><p>every voter should make the CDU as strong as possible," </p><p>Bouffier said, and "A vote for the FDP doesn\'t help us reach </p><p>our goal."  SPD Shadow Interior Minister Manfred Schaub told </p><p>us that last year\'s national elections proved that voter </p><p>sentiment could change at the last minute.  He also said: </p><p>"Elections in Hesse have always been close.  One possible </p><p>outcome is that so many CDU voters want an absolute majority </p><p>that the FDP could fail to make the 5 percent threshold, </p><p>thus giving the SPD-Greens a slight majority."  (Comment: </p><p>This is certainly possible.  If the FDP lost enough votes to </p><p>the CDU that the FDP did not reach the five percent mark, </p><p>then the CDU could win a plurality, while still losing to </p><p>the combined strength of the SPD and Greens. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Green Party caucus chief Tarek Al Wazir sees the </p><p>weakness of the Hesse SPD as quite serious.  In addition, </p><p>the Green Party\'s own polling data indicates the FDP\'s </p><p>return to state parliament is still uncertain.  "I consider </p><p>the probability of the FDP\'s making the 5 percent threshold </p><p>as less than 50 percent right now.  What is certain is that </p><p>the number three position is ours."  In contrast, FDP caucus </p><p>chairman Joerg-Uwe Hahn says that the FDP has no fear of </p><p>getting less than 5 percent.  "People will be surprised at </p><p>our strong showing.  We saw strong gains in the national </p><p>elections and we will see them in Hesse as well." </p><p> </p><p>4. This message has been coordinated with Embassy Berlin. </p><p> </p><p>BODDE </p><p></p></div>
