<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN 1188 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: NA </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, BX </p><p>SUBJ: THE SULTAN\'S FIRST YEAR ON HIS OWN - A SOLID PERFORMANCE </p><p> </p><p>1. CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT </p><p> </p><p>2. SUMMART: THE SULTAN OF BRUNEI HAS NOW GOVERNED BRUNEI ON </p><p>HIS OWN FOR A LITTLEMSORE THAN ONE YEAR.  IMPORTANT </p><p>ACCOMPLISHMENTS INCLUDE VISITS TO ALMOST EVERY AREA OF THE </p><p>NATION AND AN EMPHASIS ON A RESPONSIVE GOVERNMENT.  HE HAS </p><p>WARNED AGAINST THE SPREAD OF EXTREMIST ISLAMIC BELIEFS AND </p><p>MOVED TO REINFORCE A MODERATE ISLAMIC WAY OF LIFE IN BRUNEI. </p><p>IN THE FOREIGN POLICY AREA, BRUNEI SEEKS A ROLE THT IS BEYOND </p><p>MERE RECOGNITION OF ITS RIGHT AS AN INDEPENDENT NATION.  THE </p><p>MILITARY\'S CONTACTS WITH OTHER NATIONS ARE EXPANDING AND IT IS </p><p>MOVING TOWARDS UPGRADING ITS EQUIPMENT CAPABILITIES.  THE </p><p>SULTAN\'S ADMINISTRATION HAS SHOWN A WILLINGNESS TO TACKLE </p><p>DIFFICULT SOCIAL AND CULTURAL PROBLEMS IN THIS MALAY SOCIETY </p><p>THROUGH THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A DRUG REHABILITATION CNETER AND </p><p>AN INFORMATION PROGRAM AIMED AT PREVENTING THE SPREAD OF </p><p>AIDS.  BRUNEI\'S PROBLEMS, ESPECIALLY WHEN COMPARED TO THOSE OF </p><p>ITS NEIGHBORS, ARE MODEST.  THE NATION NEEDS TO IMPROVE BASIC </p><p>SERVICES, SUCH AS TELEPHONE AND WATER SERVICE.  MORE </p><p>TROUBLESOME IS THE CONTINUAL BLURRING OF LINES BETWEEN PUBLIC </p><p>AND PRIVATE BUSINESS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3. WITH THE DEATH OF THE SERI BEGAWAN (SUTLAN\'S FATHER) IN </p><p>SEPTEMBER 1986, THE SULTAN COULD FINALLY SET HIS OWN </p><p>COURSE FOR THE GOVERNMENT, CHOOSE HIS OWN CABINET, AND </p><p>GOVERN THE NATION OF BRUNEI, WITHOUT THE INTERVENTION OF HIS FATHER. </p><p>IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE FORTY DAY MOURNING PERIOD HE </p><p>INSTALLED A NEW CABINET THAT GAVE SOME VERY ABLE MEN, </p><p>SUCH AS PEHIN ISA, IMPORTANT POSTS.  AT THE SAME TIME </p><p>THE SULTAN SHUNTED ASIDE SEVERAL INDIVIDUALS, SUCH AS PEHIN AZIZ, </p><p>WHOSE IDEAS FOR BRUNEI DID NOT MATCH HIS OWN.  ONE OF THE FIRST AREAS </p><p>THE SULTAN AND PEHIN ISA TACKKED WAS THE CRITICISM THAT THE </p><p>SULTAN WAS TOO DISTANT FROM THE PEOPLE.  FOR THE LAST YEAR </p><p>THE SULTAN HAS JORNEYED AT LEAST ONCE A MONTH TO A </p><p>KAMPONG, MET THE KAMPONG LEADERS, VISITED THE KAMPONG </p><p>SCHOOL AND MOSQUE, AND THEN SEEN A PRIVATE </p><p>SECTOR ENTERPRISE RUN BY A BUDDING BUMIPUTRA BUSINESSMAN.  ALL </p><p>OF THIS HAS BEEN RECORDED BY RADIO TELEVISION BRUNEI AND SHOWN </p><p>ON THE VENING NEWS.  ANOTHER REGULAR FEATURE OF THESE VISITS </p><p>HAVE BEEN THE SULTAN ACCEPTING PETITIONS FROM THE KAMPONG ELDERS </p><p>FOR SERVICES AND NEEDS OF THE KAMPONG.  DURING THIS YEAR THE </p><p>SULTAN HAS VISITED ALL OF BRUNEI, INCLUDING KAMPONGS ONLY </p><p>ACCESSIBLE BY AIR OR RIVER BOAT.  A CONSITENT THEME EMPHASIZED </p><p>BY THE SULTAN AND ISA DURING THE YEAR IS THE GOVERNMENT IS TO </p><p>BE RESPONSIVE TO THE NEEDS OF THE PEOPLE. </p><p> </p><p>4. THROUGH THESE KAMPONG VISITS PEHIN ISA, WHO HEADS THE </p><p>ESTABLISHMENTS OFFICE, AND HIS STAFF HAVE BEGUN TO TACKLE THE </p><p>KAMPONG PROBLEMS, INCLUDING THE INCREASING NUMBER OF ILLEGAL ALLIENS </p><p>AND THE LACK OF SERVICES.  IN A SIMILIAR MOVE, THE MINISTER OF </p><p>EDUCATION HAS UNDERTAKEN A PROGRAM TO VISIT EVERY SHCOOL IN THE </p><p>NATION (THERE ARE 176 SCHOOLS) AND MEET THE SCHOOL PRINICPALS AND </p><p>TEACHERS.  ONE OF THE VIIBLE CHANGES IS THAT SCHOOLS ARE NOW REPARIED </p><p>WHEREAS BEFORE THEY WERE IN DEPLORABLE SHAPE, ESPECIALLY FOR A </p><p>NATION OF BRUNEI\'S WEALTH. </p><p> </p><p>5. ANOTHER CIRICISM OF THE BRUFEI GOVERNMENT IS THT IT </p><p>DOESN\'T FACE TOUGH ISSUES WITH CULTURAL AND SOCIAL </p><p>IMPLICATIONS.  ONE EXAMPLE IS THAT THE OFFICIAL LINE ON </p><p>DRUGS USED TO BE THAT THERE WAS NO PROBLEM.  DURING THE </p><p>LAST YEAR THE SULTAN HAS WARNED AGAINST THE EVILS OF DRUG </p><p>ABUSE AND THE GOVERNMENT ESTABLISHED A DRUG REHABILITATION </p><p>CENTER.  WHILE BRUNEI\'S DRUG PROGLEM IS MINOR COMPARED TO </p><p>THAT OF MALAYSIA, THE GOVERNMMENT NOW ACKNOWLEDGES </p><p>THE ISSUE AND IS WORKING TO PREVENT DRUG ABUSE. </p><p> </p><p>6. ANOTHER DIFFICULT ISSUE THAT THE HEALTH MINISTER AND HIS </p><p>DEPARTMENT HAVE FACED FORTHRIGHTLY IS AIDS.  THE NATION HAS </p><p>LAUNCHED A PUBLIC INFORMATION COMPAIGN WITH POSTERS AND </p><p>PAMPHLETS.  WHAT WAS TACITLY ACKNOWLEDGED WITH THE INTRODUCTION </p><p>OF THIS CAMPAIGN IS THAT BRUNEI HAS A COMMUNITY OF HIGH RISK </p><p>MEN, SOMETHING MOST BRUNEIANS PREFER TO OVERLOOK. </p><p> </p><p>7. ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS THE GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>REALIZATION THAT SOMETHING MUST BE DONE ABOUT THE HIGH NUMBER </p><p>OF TRAFFIC DEATHS AND ACCIDENTS THAT TAKE PLACE IN BRUNEI.  THE </p><p>HEALTH MINISTRY AND COMMUNICATIONS MINISTRY WORKED TOGETHER TO </p><p>PASS A SELT BELT LAW, A GOOD START.  THEN THE MINISTER OF </p><p>COMMUNICATIONS LAUNCHED A CAMPAIGN FOR DRIVER\'S EDUCATION. </p><p> </p><p>8. THE IMMIGRATION DEPARTMENT WORKS TO STOP ANY </p><p>KNOWN ISLAMIC EXTREMIST FROM ENTERING THE NATION.  TOP </p><p>GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS ARE WORRIED BY THE PROBLEMS IN MALAYSIA </p><p>WITH ISLAMIC EXTREMISTS AND WORK TO PREVENT TE GROWTH IN </p><p>BRUNEI.  THE SULTAN IS ALSO PROMOTING </p><p>MAINSTREAM ISLAMIC BELIEFS.  THIS YEAR THE SULTAN PERFORMED </p><p>THE HAJ ALONG WITH MANY OF ADVISORS.  THE PEOPLE OF BRUNEI, </p><p>INCLUDING BUSLOADS OF SCHOOL CHILDREN, LINED THE STREETS WHEN </p><p>HE DEPARTED AND AGAIN WHEN HE RETURNED.  THE DAY WHEN THE </p><p>SULTAN RETURNED THERE WAS A MASSIVE PUBLIC GATHERING NEAR </p><p>THE PALACE WHERRE THE SULTAN SPENT HOURS WITH HIS </p><p>SUBJECT, TAKING WITH EVERYONE, ALL TO THE CONSTERNATION </p><p>OF HIS SECURITY PEOPLE. </p><p> </p><p>9. THE SULTAN HAS WORKER TO SIDESTEP THOSE WHOSE VIEWS </p><p>ARE NOT IN LINE WITH HIS, FOR INSTANCE, THE GRAND MUFTI </p><p>WHO IS CONSIDERED PART OF THE OLD GUARD.  HIGH GOVERNMENT </p><p>OFFICIALS ARE PROMOTING THE CAREER OF THE RELATIVELY YOUNG </p><p>PERMANENT SECRETARY OF RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS, WHOSE SPEECHES </p><p>RELFLECT THE SULTAN\'S MODERATE ISLAMIC VIEWS. </p><p> </p><p>10 IN THE FOREIGH POLICY ARDA, BRUNEI IS MOVING BEYOND ITS </p><p>GOAL SINCE INDEPENDENCE, WHICH WAS RECOGNITION OF THE COUNTRY </p><p>AND ITS RIGHT TO EXIST AS AN INDEPENDENT STATE.  THE FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTRY IS PLAYING MORE OF A ROLE IN ASEAN MEETINGS AND </p><p>PREPARING FOR BRUNEI\'S LEADERSHIP OF VARIOUS COMMITTEES.  THE </p><p>ASEAN LABOR CONFERENCE, HELD IN LATE 1986, WAS THE FIRST </p><p>MEETING AT THE MINISTERIAL LEVEL HELD IN BRUNEI.  ONE OF THE </p><p>DIRECT BENEFICIARIES OF THE SERI BEGAWAN\'S PASSING FROM THE </p><p>SCENE HAS BEEN INDONESIA.  SEVERAL MONTHS AGO THE SULTAN </p><p>OFFERED A SOFT LOAN OF $100 MILLION TO INDONESIA, SOMETHING </p><p>THAT WOULD HAVE NEVER HAPPENED DURING THE SULTAN\'S FATHER </p><p>TIME BECAUSE HE NEVER FORGAVE THE INDONESIANS FOR THEIR </p><p>ROLE IN THE 1962 UPRISING. </p><p> </p><p>11. WHILE BRUNEI FOREIGN POLICY EMPHASIZES CONSENSUS, AS DOES </p><p>ITS WAY OF LIFE, AND AVOIDING CONFLICTS, THE RECENT ASEAN DEBATE </p><p>ON WHETHER OR NOT TO GO TO MANILA DEMONSTRATE THE NATION IS </p><p>WILLING TO TAKE A POSITION AND DEFEND IT.  EARLY ON BRUNEI </p><p>DECIDED THE MINISTERIAL MUST GO ON IN MANILA AND HAS NOT </p><p>WAVERED FROM THAT POSITION. </p><p> </p><p>12. THE MILITARY HAS CONTINUED TO EXPAND THEIR CONTACTS WITH </p><p>OTHER NATIONS THIS PAST YEAR.  THEY HAVE MOVED TO SHARE </p><p>INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION WITH THE MALAYSIANS AND THE MALAYSIANS </p><p>WORKED WITH THE BRUNEIANS TO CLEAR SEA AND AIR TRAFFIC DURING </p><p>THE BRUNEIAN\'S FIRING OF TWO EXOCET MISSLES.  THE BRUNEIANS ARE </p><p>CONSIDERING A JOINT VENTURE IN A MUNITIONS PLANT IN MALAYSIA. </p><p>SINGAPORE EXISTING PROGRAMS IN BRUNEI CONTINUE TO GROW.  RBAF </p><p>TROOPS ARE OBTAINING BASIC SPECIAL FORCES TRANING IN </p><p>AUSTRALIA. </p><p> </p><p>13. THE MILITARY IS MOVEING TOWARDS NEW EQUIPMENT ACQUISTIONS </p><p>INCLUDING FIXED WING AIRCRAFT, NEW PATROL BOATS (CORVETTE </p><p>CLASS) AND AN INTEGRATED RADAR SYSTEM.  THE MAJOR CONSTRAINT IS </p><p>THE LACK OF PERSONNEL.  OVER 4,000 MEN ARE ALREADY IN THE </p><p>MILITARY, A LARGE AMOUNT FOR A NATION OF JUST 225,000 WITH ONLY </p><p>ABOUT 135,000 MALAYS. </p><p> </p><p>14. BRUNEI\'S PROBLEMS ARE MODEST, ESPECIALLY WHEN COMPARED TO </p><p>NEIGHBORING NATIONS.  IN SPITE OF THE BEST EFFORTS OF THE NEW </p><p>MINISTER OF DEVELOPMENT, HIS MINISTRY, WHICH IS REALLY A GIANT </p><p>PUBLIC WORKS DEPARTMENT, JUST ISN\'T ABLE TO MAINTAIN ROADS WELL </p><p>OR BUILD GOOD BRIDGES IN A TIMELY FASHION.  WHY A NATION WITH </p><p>6 FEET OF RAINFALL A YEAR HAS PERIODIC WATER SHORAGES IS A </p><p>QUESTION NO MINISTRY OFFICALS WANTS TO ANSWER.  LOCAL TELEPHONE </p><p>SERVICE CONTINUES TO BE A SORE SPOT WITH EVERYONE. </p><p> </p><p>15. ONE PROBLEM THAT IS GETTING BIGGER IS THE BLURRING OF </p><p>LINES BETWEEN PULBIC AND PRIVATE BUSINESS.  AN OBVIOUS EXAMPLE </p><p>IS THE INTERNATION BANK OF BRUNEI, FORMERLY THE ISLAND </p><p>DEVELOPMENT BANK.  THIS BANK IS CONTROLLED BY THE ROYAL FAMILY </p><p>AND THE DIRECTORS ARE MEMBERS OF THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE.  THE </p><p>QUESTION IS WHO SHOULD REGULATE THE BANK IF THE MINISTRY </p><p>OFFICIALS ARE THE DIRECTORS.  ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS THE GROWING </p><p>NUMBER OF FIRMS WITH CLOSE TIES TO THE ROYAL FAMILY OR </p><p>RELATIVES OF MINISTERS.  THE QUESTION IS: "JUST HOW COZY CAN </p><p>THE RELATIONSHIPS BE BEFORE THEY CAUSE DIFFICULTIES. </p><p> </p><p>16. ANOTHER PROBLEM AREA IS ON PUBLICITY ATTACHED TO </p><p>THE SULTAN\'S VENTURES OUTSIDE OF BRUNEI, WHETHER IT BE THE </p><p>RECENT PURCHASE OF THE BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL OR THE SOFT </p><p>LOAN FOR INDONESIA.  MONEY SPENT INSIDE BRUNEI IS NOT </p><p>VIEWED IN A HARSH LIGHT, FOR INSTANCE, BRUNEIANS DO NOT </p><p>VIEW THE PALACE AS AN EXTRAVAGENCE BECAUSE IT DOUBLES AS A </p><p>GOVERNMENT BUILDING AND THEY GET TO VISIT IT AT LEAST ONCE </p><p>A YEAR, AT HARI RAJA, WHEN THE SULTAN SHAKES EVERYONE\'S </p><p>HAOND AND GIVES FOOD TO ALL VISITORS.  HOWEVER, BRUNEIANS </p><p>QUESTION PURCHASES OR VENTURES OUTSIDE THE NATION WITH THE </p><p>ARGUMENT THAT THE MONEY SHOULD BE SPENT ON DEVELOPING </p><p>BRUNEI. </p><p> </p><p>FERGUSON </p><p></p></div>
