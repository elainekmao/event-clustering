Part of MAG\'s </p><p>    Editorial Charter reads: "MAG is a privately owned </p><p>    newspaper publishing company established in 2002 which is </p><p>    not aligned to any group or political party in Zimbabwe, </p><p>    Southern African Development Community (SADC), or anywhere </p><p>    in the world.  In short we are politically neutral and </p><p>    impartial.  In Zimbabwe, we vow to pursue a middle-of-the- </p><p>    road, apolitical path that necessitates that we report </p><p>    business, political and other events as they happen..." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
