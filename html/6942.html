<p>S E C R E T AMMAN 001881 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/29/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MOPS, EPET, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZ01: MUASHER SAYS STORY ON RESUMPTION OF OIL </p><p>TANKER TRAFFIC BETWEEN JORDAN AND IRAQ MOST LIKELY NOT TRUE </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: A/DCM Doug Silliman for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S)  The Ambassador raised with Foreign Minister Marwan </p><p>Muasher March 29 local press reports that as many as thirty </p><p>Jordanian oil tanker trucks have returned to Iraq to restart </p><p>the delivery of Iraqi crude to Jordan.  The Ambassador said </p><p>he found the reports beyond comprehension.  In response to a </p><p>specific Jordanian request two days ago to resume deliveries </p><p>of Iraqi crude via road, we had told them that we could not </p><p>agree to any heavy truck traffic on the Amman-Baghdad highway </p><p>moving east to west.  The Ambassador commented that, in fact, </p><p>he had checked with the U.S. military in the region and did </p><p>not believe that tankers had actually gone back to Iraq.  He </p><p>asked for confirmation from the GOJ that this was correct. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S)  He repeated warnings that it would be extremely </p><p>dangerous for tanker trucks to try to resume crude oil </p><p>deliveries.  Fighting continued in western Iraq.  Coalition </p><p>forces dominated the area, but have not yet secured the </p><p>Amman-Baghdad highway, nor the road to the oil loading </p><p>terminal near H-1.  Further, the Ambassador pointed out the </p><p>dire consequences to U.S.-Jordanian relations if coalition or </p><p>Iraqi forces were accidentally to kill a Jordanian oil truck </p><p>driver.  The public outcry would be almost uncontrollable. </p><p>The GOJ would find itself in an impossible position.  The </p><p>damage from such an incident would far outweigh any gain </p><p>Jordan would receive by resuming a small fraction of its oil </p><p>imports from Iraq -- imports not needed since alternate </p><p>sources had been secured. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S)  Muasher said he did not believe the reports to be </p><p>true, but pledged he would check into them and respond </p><p>quickly.  He agreed that the risks of restarting land transit </p><p>of Iraqi oil under the current conditions far outweighed the </p><p>possible benefits. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S)  Our military colleagues in Task Force - West report </p><p>that no Jordanian oil tankers have crossed the Iraqi border </p><p>in recent days.  While it appears that this press story may </p><p>not be true, we felt it necessary to set down a strong marker </p><p>against any resumption of oil shipments to Jordan while </p><p>hostilities are ongoing in Iraq.  From a more long-term </p><p>perspective, the Ambassador reminded the Foreign Minister </p><p>that a mutually agreed condition to our supplemental economic </p><p>assistance was an end to Jordanian dependency on "subsidized" </p><p>Iraqi oil. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
