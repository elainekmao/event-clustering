<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 000728 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS, S/CT, INR/NESA; NSC FOR E. </p><p>MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  04-29-13 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, PINR, CE </p><p>SUBJECT:  After Tigers issue public apology, key </p><p>minister says he will rejoin GSL peace talks team </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  (A) SA/INS-Colombo 04/28/03 class e-mail </p><p> </p><p>-      (B) Colombo-SA/INS 04/28/03 fax </p><p>-      (C) Colombo 720, and previous </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Lewis Amselem, Deputy Chief of </p><p>Mission.  Reasons 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  A contretemps was sparked April 28 </p><p>when key Minister Milinda Moragoda suddenly announced </p><p>that he would no longer be a part of the GSL\'s peace </p><p>talks team.  Moragoda blamed the Tigers, asserting that </p><p>the group had spread inaccuracies about him.  The Tigers </p><p>quickly apologized and Moragoda has since retracted his </p><p>decision.  The whole confusing skein of events seems to </p><p>have rebounded in a positive way, with the Tigers -- who </p><p>have been sending very negative signals of late -- </p><p>inviting Moragoda to meet with them.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>============================================= </p><p>ACT ONE:  Key Minister Departs GSL Peace Team </p><p>============================================= </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  A contretemps was sparked late April 28 when a </p><p>key Sri Lankan minister announced he would no longer be </p><p>a part of the government\'s delegation to the peace </p><p>talks.  (Note:  Per a recent decision, the Tamil Tigers </p><p>have suspended their participation in the peace talks. </p><p>The GSL and the Norwegians are working to get the talks </p><p>back on track -- see Ref C.)  In a thinly disguised leak </p><p>(see Para 5 below), Milinda Morogoda, the Minister of </p><p>Economic Reforms, told the press that he was resigning </p><p>from the government\'s team because the Liberation Tigers </p><p>of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) had spread inaccuracies about him. </p><p>He complained specifically that LTTE Political Chief </p><p>S.P. Thamilchelvam had told a local newspaper that </p><p>Moragoda had promised the Tigers that they would be able </p><p>to attend the April 14 Washington seminar.  (Note:  The </p><p>Tigers were not able to attend the seminar because they </p><p>are on our FTO list.)  Morogoda, who vociferously denied </p><p>he had given any such promise, said he would refuse to </p><p>take part in talks until the Tigers cleared the air over </p><p>the matter. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) (((Note:  In making his comments, Moragoda was </p><p>making reference to a long interview given by </p><p>Thamilchelvam that was published in the April 27 edition </p><p>of the SUNDAY LEADER -- see Ref B for text of the </p><p>interview.  In the quote that angered Moragoda, </p><p>Thamilchelvam was cited as stating that Moragoda had </p><p>told the LTTE that he would "make all endeavors to </p><p>ensure Dr. Balasingham\'s participation on behalf of the </p><p>LTTE in the Washington conference.  That was a promise </p><p>given by Milinda Morogoda."  FYI:  Anton Balasingham is </p><p>the LTTE\'s chief negotiator.))) </p><p> </p><p>========================= </p><p>ACT TWO:  LTTE Apologizes </p><p>========================= </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Reacting at lightning speed to Moragoda\'s </p><p>comments, the London-based Balasingham formally </p><p>apologized to Morogoda on April 29.  The apology was </p><p>issued by the pro-LTTE website TamilNet and also in a </p><p>phone call Balasingham placed to Morogoda (also see </p><p>Para 5 below).  On TamilNet, Balasingham was quoted as </p><p>saying that the LTTE regretted that Morogoda had been </p><p>offended as "his contributions to furthering the peace </p><p>process are invaluable.  Mr. Morogoda could not and </p><p>certainly did not give us an assurance that we would be </p><p>able to participate."  A Reuters news report also quoted </p><p>Balasingham as saying "Mr. Milinda Morogoda is a pillar </p><p>of strength of the peace process and I deeply regret </p><p>that this misunderstanding has happened."  In the </p><p>meantime, Thamilchelvam also denied on TamilNet that he </p><p>had made the comments attributed to him and suggested </p><p>there had been errors in translation of his remarks. </p><p>============================ </p><p>ACT THREE:  Morogoda is Back </p><p>============================ </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Accepting Balasingham\'s apology with grace, </p><p>Moragoda announced publicly that he was back on the </p><p>government\'s peace team on April 29.  Moragoda confirmed </p><p>this announcement in a conversation with the Ambassador </p><p>earlier that day.  Morogoda told the Ambassador that </p><p>Balasingham, in a very conciliatory mode, had called him </p><p>late April 28 to apologize over the incident. </p><p>Balasingham claimed that Thamilchelvam\'s comments had </p><p>been "mistranslated" and that it was all a </p><p>misunderstanding.  (Note:  FYI.  Morogoda had called the </p><p>Ambassador on April 28 and reviewed with him his plan to </p><p>announce his resignation from the GSL peace talks team. </p><p>He asked the Ambassador\'s advice regarding how to spread </p><p>the news.  The Ambassador demurred giving any advice on </p><p>the matter.) </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) In a further sign of conciliation during their </p><p>phone call, Balasingham invited Morogoda to accompany </p><p>him to the Wanni region next week to meet with the LTTE </p><p>leadership.  (Note:  This is the first that we heard of </p><p>Balasingham\'s plan to visit Sri Lanka.)  Balasingham </p><p>said he realized that radio silence vis-a-vis the </p><p>Norwegian government facilitators was perhaps not the </p><p>best course of action and he told Morogoda that he </p><p>planned to invite Norwegian special envoy Erik Solheim </p><p>to meet with him in London soon.  (Note:  Solheim has </p><p>reportedly been trying to meet with Balasingham for the </p><p>past several weeks to no avail.  Per Ref C, we </p><p>understand that a Norwegian team is due to visit the </p><p>Wanni on April 30 in an effort to break the ice between </p><p>Norway and the LTTE.) </p><p> </p><p>======= </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>======= </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Moragoda is a key member of the government\'s </p><p>peace talks team.  Although not the GSL\'s chief </p><p>negotiator, a position held by the more senior G.L. </p><p>Peiris, Moragoda is acknowledged to be a well-informed, </p><p>well-connected, dynamic presence on the team.  His </p><p>absence would be a real loss for the GSL and it is good </p><p>that he\'s back on the team.  In any case, the whole </p><p>confusing skein of events seems to have rebounded in a </p><p>positive way with the Tigers inviting Moragoda to meet </p><p>with them.  Given that they have been sending very </p><p>negative signals of late, e.g., pulling out from the </p><p>talks, such a meeting could potentially go some way in </p><p>helping clear matters up.  (Note:  The fact that </p><p>Moragoda mentioned the matter to the Ambassador before </p><p>his sudden announcement and asked him how he should play </p><p>it with the press was interesting.  It tends to </p><p>underscore the uncertainty and doubt with which the </p><p>government approaches the whole subject of how to deal </p><p>with the Tigers.)  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
