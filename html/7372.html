<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ROME 001565 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/08/2013 </p><p>TAGS: MOPS, MARR, PREL, IT, IRAQI FREEDOM </p><p>SUBJECT: U/S BOLTON BRIEFS ITALIAN DEFENSE MINISTER </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: DEPUTY CHIEF OF MISSION EMIL SKODON FOR </p><p>REASONS 1.5(B)(D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY.  UNDERSECRETARY OF STATE JOHN BOLTON MET WITH </p><p>ITALIAN DEFENSE MINISTER ANTONIO MARTINO IN ROME ON APRIL 9 </p><p>TO DISCUSS IRAQ AND THE TRANSATLANTIC ALLIANCE.  THE MOD IS </p><p>    PREPARING A PACKAGE OF POST-CONFLICT CONTRIBUTIONS FOR THE </p><p>PRIME MINISTER\'S APPROVAL TO INCLUDE MILITARY POLICE, </p><p>MINESWEEPERS AND NBC UNITS, ACCORDING TO MARTINO.  U/S BOLTON </p><p>URGED MARTINO TO USE ITALY\'S EU PRESIDENCY TO MAKE PROGRESS </p><p>ON POL-MIL ISSUES SUCH AS NATO-EU INTEGRATION.  MARTINO HOPES </p><p>TO MEET WITH SECRETARY POWELL, SECRETARY RUMSFELD AND DR. </p><p>RICE ON MAY 6, FOLLOWING THE NATO-UKRAINE MEETING IN </p><p>WASHINGTON.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) U/S BOLTON THANKED MARTINO FOR HIS SUPPORT ON THE </p><p>173RD AIRBORNE BRIGADE\'S DEPLOYMENT FROM ITALY, AND FOR THE </p><p>GOI\'S SUPPORT IN GENERAL ON IRAQ.  MARTINO NOTED THAT </p><p>DISPUTES OVER THE IRAQ CONFLICT HAVE RESULTED IN MANY </p><p>EUROPEAN COUNTRIES RE-ASSESSING AND RECONFIRMING THE </p><p>IMPORTANCE OF THEIR BONDS WITH THE US.  AS AN EXAMPLE, </p><p>MARTINO SAID GERMAN DEFMIN STRUCK HAD RECENTLY EMPHASIZED TO </p><p>HIM THE IMPORTANCE OF GERMANY\'S PARTNERSHIP WITH THE US.  IN </p><p>CONTRAST, FRANCE WAS LIKELY TO CONTINUE TO BE UNHELPFUL; THE </p><p>FRENCH DEFMIN HAD ADMITTED TO HIM THAT THE GOF\'S GOAL IS TO </p><p>RESTORE FRANCE TO WORLD POWER STATUS. MARTINO MENTIONED TO </p><p>U/S BOLTON THAT THE FRENCH HAVE FORMALLY APPROACHED THE GOI </p><p>TO SUGGEST THAT THREE ITALIAN SHIPS (TWO MINESWEEPERS AND A </p><p>SUPPORT SHIP) IN DJIBOUTI FOR A CANCELLED EXERCISE (ARABIAN </p><p>GAUNTLET) JOIN SEVERAL FRENCH SHIPS TO DO A BILATERAL </p><p>COUNTERMINING OPERATION BEFORE INTEGRATING INTO A EUROMARFOR </p><p>UNIT OPERATING IN THE GULF IN SUPPORT OF OPERATION ENDURING </p><p>FREEDOM.  MARTINO SUSPECTED THIS MIGHT BE A FRENCH ATTEMPT TO </p><p>FIND A WAY INTO OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM AND ASKED FOR USG </p><p>THOUGHTS ON THE FRENCH PROPOSAL. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) MARTINO TOLD U/S BOLTON THAT THE POST-CONFLICT </p><p>    PROPOSAL THE MOD IS PREPARING FOR THE PM\'S APPROVAL WILL </p><p>INCLUDE MILITARY POLICE, MINESWEEPERS AND NBC UNITS.  DESPITE </p><p>ITALY\'S LIMITED MILITARY RESOURCES, MARTINO SAID HE WANTS TO </p><p>PRESENT A SELF-SUSTAINING PACKAGE.  THE MILITARY POLICE </p><p>CONTRIBUTION WILL LIKELY BE A JOINT CARABINIERI-GUARDIA </p><p>CIVILE OPERATION, BASED ON HIS DISCUSSION WITH THE SPANISH </p><p>DEFMIN AT THE EU DEFMIN MEETING IN ATHENS, MARTINO EXPLAINED. </p><p> HE OBSERVED THAT SOLIDERS SERVING OUTSIDE OF THEIR COUNTRIES </p><p>NOW ACT AS AMBASSADORS OF PEACE, BRINGING STABILITY AND </p><p>ASSISTANCE, RATHER THAN AS COLONISTS AS IN THE PAST.  THE </p><p>CARABINIERI ARE VERY EXPERIENCED IN THIS AREA, HE SAID.  U/S </p><p>BOLTON NOTED THAT CIVILIAN POLICE WILL BE PARTICULARLY </p><p>IMPORTANT DURING THE GAP BETWEEN THE FALL OF SADDAM HUSSEIN\'S </p><p>REGIME AND THE INSTALLATION OF AN INTERIM AUTHORITY, A PERIOD </p><p>THAT WAS RAPIDLY APPROACHING.  THE SOONER ITALY\'S CARABINIERI </p><p>CAN GET THERE THE BETTER, HE SAID.  THEIR EXPERIENCE TRAINING </p><p>LOCAL POLICE WOULD BE IN GREAT DEMAND, HE ADDED; MOST OF THE </p><p>EXISTING POLICE FORCE MAY NEED TO BE REPLACED BECAUSE OF TIES </p><p>TO THE BA\'ATH PARTY. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) IN CLOSING, MARTINO MENTIONED TO U/S BOLTON THAT HE </p><p>PLANS TO ATTEND THE MAY 4-5 NATO-UKRAINE MEETING IN </p><p>WASHINGTON. HE SAID HE HOPES TO MEET WITH SECRETARY POWELL, </p><p>SECRETARY RUMSFELD AND DR. RICE ON MAY 6.  COMMENT: WE </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>UNDERSTAND REQUESTS FOR THESE MEETINGS ARE ALREADY BEING </p><p>WORKED IN WASHINGTON.  GIVEN MARTINO\'S STATUS AS A SERIOUS </p><p>CANDIDATE TO REPLACE LORD ROBERTSON AT NATO, WE ENDORSE SUCH </p><p>MEETINGS AS AN EXCELLENT OPPORTUNITY FOR SENIOR USG </p><p>POLICYMAKERS TO ASSESS MARTINO\'S VIEWS ON ISSUES IMPORTANT </p><p>FOR NATO.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>    5. (U) U/S BOLTON CLEARED THIS CABLE. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p> 2003ROME01565 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
