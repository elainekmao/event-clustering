(A) KATHMANDU 2038 </p><p> </p><p>     B. (B) KATHMANDU 2035 </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Four people were slightly injured in a series of </p><p>small explosions in the heart of Kathmandu--including two in </p><p>or near the Thamel tourist district--October 27.  The </p><p>Maoists\' October 28 strike in the Kathmandu Valley and </p><p>October 27 strike in the southern Terai plains region </p><p>bordering India were largely observed by the general public. </p><p>At least 30 Maoists were reported killed when the Royal Nepal </p><p>Army (RNA) repulsed a Maoist attack on a small airport in the </p><p>remote northeastern district of Okhaldhunga October 27.  An </p><p>October 24 press statement from the Maoist Central Committee </p><p>reiterates the insurgent leadership\'s openness to talks and </p><p>calls on the King to create an environment conducive to </p><p>dialogue.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>THAMEL TARGETED </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) In an apparent effort to intimidate the local </p><p>population into observing the general strike, or "bandh," </p><p>they had called for October 28 in Kathmandu Valley (Ref B), </p><p>suspected Maoists set off a series of small bombs within the </p><p>space of a few hours October 27 in heavily traveled areas of </p><p>Kathmandu--including, for the first time, the tourist </p><p>district of Thamel.  Although a mid-afternoon bomb placed in </p><p>a bathroom near a popular pizza restaurant in Thamel blew out </p><p>the walls of the restroom and some windows of adjoining </p><p>shops, no injuries were reported.  A bomb in the parking lot </p><p>of a crowded movie theatre (the only English-language cinema </p><p>in town) a few blocks from Thamel near the Royal Palace </p><p>injured one Nepali, while a third explosion at a dairy near </p><p>the Indian and British Embassies injured three.  No injuries </p><p>were reported in a fourth explosion in the historic city of </p><p>Bhaktapur. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>VALLEY, TERAI STRIKES OBSERVED </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  The October 28 strike called by the Maoists for the </p><p>Kathmandu Valley appears to have been generally observed </p><p>within the city, with about 65 percent of shops and </p><p>businesses remaining closed for the day.  Commercial and </p><p>private vehicular traffic was minimal throughout the day, </p><p>with only the occasional government- or diplomatic-plated </p><p>vehicle speeding past processions of bicycles and rickshaws. </p><p>Both Lincoln International School, which is attended by most </p><p>dependent children at the Embassy and the USAID Mission, and </p><p>the British School were closed for the day.  An October 27 </p><p>bandh called for the southern plain region (known as the </p><p>Terai) bordering India was apparently best observed in </p><p>outlying districts, while business in the larger (and better </p><p>defended) cities of Hetauda and Nepalgunj seemed less </p><p>affected.  Sources in the Nepal Sadbhavana Party, whose </p><p>stronghold is in the Terai, told us urban areas of </p><p>Nawalaparasi, Rautahat and Rupandehi Districts were deserted, </p><p>with shops closed and no vehicular movement.  An NGO source </p><p>told us almost all shops were open in Nepalgunj (home of the </p><p>RNA\'s First Division), however, and motorcycles (but no </p><p>private cars or jeeps) were plying the streets, although </p><p>long-distance buses had apparently suspended operations for </p><p>the day.  A businessman in the industrial town of Hetauda in </p><p>Makwanpur District offered the most encouraging report, </p><p>telling us that all the shops were open and traffic normal </p><p>October 27. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>OKHALDHUNGA ATTACK </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  A large force of Maoists attacked a combined </p><p>police/RNA post guarding an airport in Okhaldhunga District, </p><p>180 miles northeast of Kathmandu, at about 10:30 p.m. local </p><p>time October 27.  According to an RNA source, the security </p><p>forces succeeded in repulsing the attack, which ended by </p><p>about 2:30 a.m. October 28.  The Maoists, who suffered at </p><p>least 32 confirmed casualties, did not succeed in penetrating </p><p>the perimeter.  Two RNA soldiers, including the platoon </p><p>commander, a captain, were killed in the attack.  Chief of </p><p>Army Staff Gen. Pyar Jung Thapa reportedly visited the site </p><p>and inspected RNA defenses there the previous week. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>MORE PARTY PROPAGANDA ON PEACE TALKS </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) A press statement from the Maoist Central Committee, </p><p>dated October 24, claims that the party "has kept the door </p><p>for peace talks and negotiation open."  The "grave situation" </p><p>of the country presents two options.  Either the King must </p><p>"demonstrate the kind of sacrifice that could ultimately </p><p>benefit the nation and the people" by accepting the election </p><p>of a constituent assembly, with the aim of drafting a new </p><p>constitution.  On the other hand, "if the King, instead of </p><p>leading the nation toward national unity and people\'s </p><p>sovereignty, tries to suppress people by deploying the Royal </p><p>Nepal Army and an international army . . . then there is no </p><p>alternative before the people but to go ahead with the </p><p>historic struggle. . . . Here we would like to make clear </p><p>that our party is ready for both options."  If the King </p><p>prefers to seek dialogue, the statement puts the burden on </p><p>him to offer a proposal for a "conducive atmosphere." </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  Up to now, the Maoists, despite their fiery </p><p>anti-foreign rhetoric, have generally not targeted </p><p>tourist-frequented areas in their campaign.  Even though no </p><p>one was hurt in the October 27 bombing in Thamel and just one </p><p>person slightly injured in the cinema parking lot bombing the </p><p>same day, the message was clear.  The Maoists clearly have </p><p>the capability to harm foreigners.  In this context, the </p><p>Maoists\' injunction to the King to create a "conducive </p><p>atmosphere" for dialogue takes on a significantly more </p><p>threatening tone---and throws into even greater uncertainty </p><p>the insurgents\' sincerity in calling for talks.  In view of </p><p>this unsettling new note, the EAC has reviewed the Embassy\'s </p><p>security posture and determined that it is appropriate.  We </p><p>will continue to monitor the security situation with and </p><p>inform the Department of any significant developments. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
