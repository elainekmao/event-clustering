CHRISTOPHER RITTER OF USAID\'S BUREAU FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH, </p><p>AGRICULTURE & TRADE (EGAT) RECENTLY REVIEWED FAO\'S WORLD </p><p>AGRICULTURAL INFORMATION CENTRE (WAICENT) AND RELATED </p><p>PROJECTS IN SETTING STANDARDS IN AGRICULTURAL INFORMATION </p><p>MANAGEMENT AND CAPACITY BUILDING IN INFORMATION MANAGEMENT </p><p>FOR DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. KEY FOCAL ISSUES WERE: MAKING SURE </p><p>THE INFORMATION FAO DELIVERS IS ACTUALLY USEFUL AND ITS </p><p>SUCCESS IN CONVINCING POLICY-MAKERS OF THE IMPORTANCE OF </p><p>INFORMATION MANAGEMENT. HE CONCLUDED THAT FAO IS "AHEAD OF </p><p>THE CURVE" IN COPING WITH THE PROBLEM OF AGRICULTURAL </p><p>KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT IN DEVELOPMENT. MOREOVER, HE IDENTIFIED </p><p>AREAS FOR POSSIBLE FAO/USAID COLLABORATION. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p>BACKGROUND - IMPROVING RURAL COMMUNICATION - INSTITUTIONS </p><p>AND PROCESSES; AND CAPACITY BUILDING </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  05916  01 OF 03  101628Z </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p> </p><p>2. CHRISTOPHER RITTER, A AAAS DIPLOMACY FELLOW WITH </p><p>USAID/EGAT, RECENTLY REVIEWED FAO\'S WORLD AGRICULTURAL </p><p>INFORMATION CENTRE (WAICENT) AND ITS EFFORTS RELATED TO </p><p>SETTING STANDARDS IN AGRICULTURAL INFORMATION MANAGEMENT AND </p><p>CAPACITY BUILDING IN INFORMATION MANAGEMENT FOR DEVELOPING </p><p>COUNTRIES. </p><p> </p><p>3. FAO HAS RECENTLY DEVELOPED TWO MODELS WHICH ADDRESS </p><p>DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF IMPROVING AGRICULTURAL INFORMATION </p><p>EXCHANGE AND COMMUNICATION. THE VIRTUAL EXTENSION, RESEARCH </p><p>AND COMMUNICATION NETWORK (VERCON) MODEL AIMS AT ENHANCING </p><p>LINKAGES BETWEEN THE RESEARCH AND EXTENSION FUNCTIONS, BASED </p><p>MAINLY ON IMPROVED EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION USING MODERN </p><p>INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES (ICTS). </p><p>THE IDEA IS TO SUPPORT DIRECT, TWO-WAY COMMUNICATION BETWEEN </p><p>FIELD EXTENSION STAFF AND RESEARCHERS WHO, IN THE EXISTING </p><p>REGIME, ONLY HAVE CONTACT THAT IS MEDIATED BY HIGHER </p><p>ADMINISTRATIVE LEVELS--IF THEY HAVE ANY AT ALL. </p><p> </p><p>4. THE VERCON CONCEPT IS CURRENTLY BEING PILOTED IN EGYPT, </p><p>WHERE CONVENTIONAL PHONE-BASED E-MAIL CONNECTIONS ARE HAVING </p><p>A LARGE EFFECT IN CUTTING THROUGH LAYERS OF BUREAUCRACY TO </p><p>CONNECT EXTENSIONISTS DIRECTLY, AND ESSENTIALLY FOR THE </p><p>FIRST TIME, WITH RESEARCHERS AND NEW SOURCES OF AGRICULTURAL </p><p>INFORMATION. </p><p> </p><p>5. THE FARMER INFORMATION NETWORK (FARMNET) MODEL AIMS AT </p><p>BUILDING COMMUNICATION NETWORKS BETWEEN AGRICULTURAL </p><p>PRODUCERS THEMSELVES, OR THEIR REPRESENTATIVES IN RURAL </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  05916  01 OF 03  101628Z </p><p>COMMUNITIES, PUBLIC AND PRIVATE AGRICULTURAL SERVICE </p><p>PROVIDERS OF MANY FORMS, AND INTERFACES WITH THE "MARKET" </p><p>FOR RURAL PRODUCE.  FARMNET IS MEANT TO EXPLOIT FULLY THE </p><p>EXISTING COMMUNICATION INFRASTRUCTURE, INCLUDING TELEPHONY, </p><p>PRINT AND RADIO, WHILE ALSO AUGMENTING INFORMATION </p><p>TECHNOLOGY (IT) SELECTIVELY USING APPROPRIATE NEWER ICTS. </p><p>FARMNET PILOT STUDIES ARE UNDERWAY IN PARTNERSHIP WITH </p><p>GOVERNMENTS IN NAMIBIA AND UGANDA. SPECIFICALLY, THE FARMNET </p><p>PROJECT IN UGANDA RETAINS A FOCUS ON RADIO, BUT WILL INCLUDE </p><p>E-MAIL, ALONG WITH OTHER OLDER AND NEWER ICTS TO IMPROVE </p><p>WEATHER AND MARKET INFORMATION DELIVERY. LINKING VERCONS </p><p>WITH FARMNETS IS AN OBVIOUS THING TO WORK ON. </p><p> </p><p>6. ON CAPACITY BUILDING, FAO IS WORKING ON AN INFORMATION </p><p>MANAGEMENT RESOURCE KIT AIMED AT ADDRESSING THE DEMANDS OF </p><p>ITS MEMBERS IN AGRICULTURAL INFORMATION MANAGEMENT USING </p><p>MODERN ICTS.  THE RESOURCE KIT CONSISTS OF A SET OF </p><p>EDUCATIONAL MODULES, DELIVERED THROUGH COMPUTER-BASED </p><p>DISTANCE LEARNING AND FOUR MODULES ARE IN VARIOUS STAGES OF </p><p>DEVELOPMENT. THE CONTENT OF THE MODULES IS BEING DEVELOPED </p><p>BY CONTRACTORS, INCLUDING CORNELL UNIVERSITY, THE UNIVERSITY </p><p>OF SASKATCHEWAN, THE TECHNICAL CENTRE FOR AGRICULTURAL AND </p><p>RURAL COOPERATION IN WAGENINGEN (CTA), </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ2965 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  05916  02 OF 03  101629Z </p><p>ACTION IO-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  CIAE-00  COME-00  CTME-00 </p><p>      WHA-00   SRPP-00  EAP-00   EB-00    EUR-00   E-00     UTED-00 </p><p>      VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   VCE-00   NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OES-00 </p><p>      OIC-02   OMB-01   IRM-00   STR-00   TEST-00  TRSE-00  USIE-00 </p><p>      R-00     PRM-00   SAS-00     /003W </p><p>                  ------------------158BA7  101739Z /38 </p><p>P 101453Z DEC 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 7264 </p><p>INFO EU MEMBER STATES COLLECTIVE </p><p>AMEMBASSY OTTAWA </p><p>AMEMBASSY CANBERRA </p><p>AMEMBASSY TOKYO </p><p>AMEMBASSY BERN </p><p>USDA FAS WASHDC 2459 </p><p>USEU BRUSSELS 2995 </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 03 ROME 005916 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FROM U.S. MISSION IN ROME </p><p> </p><p>USDA/FAS FOR U/S PENN, MCHAMBLISS AND LREICH </p><p>USAID FOR A/NATSIOS, AA/EGAT ESIMMONS, AA/DCHA WINTER, </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  05916  02 OF 03  101629Z </p><p>DAA/PPC JSIMON </p><p>STATE FOR A/S IO HOLMES, A/S PRM DEWEY, U/S GLOBAL </p><p>DOBRIANSKY, IO/EDA WINNICK </p><p>NSC FOR JDWORKEN </p><p>USEU BRUSSELS FOR USAID/PLERNER </p><p>TOKYO FOR USAID REP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAID, EAGR, AORC, WFP, FAO, UN, PREF, EU </p><p>SUBJECT: FAO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY UPDATE - "AHEAD OF THE </p><p>CURVE" </p><p> </p><p>AND THE INTERNATIONAL SERVICE FOR NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL </p><p>RESEARCH (ISNAR) IN THE HAGUE. FAO WORKS WITH A LOCAL </p><p>INSTRUCTIONAL DESIGNER TO TRANSLATE CONTRACTORS\' CONTENT </p><p>MATERIAL INTO SELF-STRUCTURED, COMPUTER-BASED INSTRUCTIONAL </p><p>UNITS APPROXIMATELY 30 MINUTES IN LENGTH. IN GENERAL, RITTER </p><p>IS OF THE VIEW THAT FAO HAS A QUALITY PRODUCT AND A SOLID </p><p>PROCESS WITH GOOD PROSPECTS FOR MAINTAINING A HIGH LEVEL OF </p><p>QUALITY. </p><p> </p><p>7. FAO IS ALSO FACILITATING THE DEVELOPMENT OF A GLOBAL </p><p>PARTNERSHIP INITIATIVE, CALLED AGORA (ACCESS TO GLOBAL </p><p>ONLINE RESEARCH IN AGRICULTURE), WHICH AIMS TO PROVIDE FREE </p><p>OR REDUCED-PRICE ACCESS TO LEARNED JOURNALS IN AGRICULTURE </p><p>FOR DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. THIS IS A PROJECT THAT IS ENGAGING </p><p>INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS (IPR) MATTERS WITH THE GOAL OF </p><p>INCREASING ACCESS TO AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH THAT IS CURRENTLY </p><p>DISSEMINATED THROUGH PROPRIETARY CHANNELS -MAINLY </p><p>COPYRIGHTED JOURNALS, SUBSCRIPTIONS - WHICH ARE TOO COSTLY </p><p>FOR INDIVIDUALS OR INSTITUTIONS IN MANY DEVELOPING </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  05916  02 OF 03  101629Z </p><p>COUNTRIES. THIS PROJECT BUILDS ON THE MODEL OF THE HEALTH </p><p>INTERNETWORK ACCESS TO RESEARCH INITIATIVE (HINARI), AN </p><p>INITIATIVE IN THE HEALTH SECTOR DEVELOPED BY THE WORLD </p><p>HEALTH ORGANIZATION (WHO), WHICH HAS BROUGHT THE MAJOR </p><p>COMMERCIAL PUBLISHERS INTO AN AGREEMENT TO PERMIT ACCESS TO </p><p>SEVERAL HUNDRED JOURNALS. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>THE MASSIVE JOB OF KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. FAO\'S WORLD AGRICULTURAL INFORMATION CENTER (WAICENT) </p><p>AIMS AT IMPROVING MEMBERS\' ACCESS TO THE COLLECTION OF </p><p>CONTENT ON THE ORGANIZATION\'S WEBSITE AND INTRANET </p><p>(PRESENTLY OVER 500,000 WEB PAGES, 100,000 FULL-TEXT </p><p>DOCUMENTS, ETC).  IMPROVING ACCESS TO SUCH ENORMOUS </p><p>QUANTITIES OF DIGITALLY BASED INFORMATION IS A MAJOR </p><p>"TASKER" FOR ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS FAO. </p><p> </p><p>9. FAO\'S APPROACH TO INCREASING ACCESS TO AGRICULTURAL </p><p>INFORMATION IS THROUGH INNOVATIVE WORK IN THE TECHNOLOGY OF </p><p>MANAGING HUGE AMOUNTS OF INFORMATION. THE WEAKEST PART OF </p><p>WAICENT IS ITS USER INTERFACE, WHICH NEEDS WORK. TO ITS </p><p>CREDIT, FAO REALIZES REFINEMENT THOUGH TESTING AMONG END </p><p>USERS OUTSIDE OF FAO IS REQUIRED. HOWEVER, THE UNDERLYING </p><p>DESIGN OF WAICENT IS IMPRESSIVE AND OFFERS A SOLID </p><p>FOUNDATION ON WHICH TO REFINE THE PUBLIC FACE OF WAICENT. </p><p>FAO IS ALSO SLOWLY COMING TO GRIPS WITH THE ULTIMATE, BUT </p><p>VERY DIFFICULT TO ANSWER QUESTION: HOW WAICENT\'S INFORMATION </p><p>RESOURCES ARE ACTUALLY BEING USED AND WHAT IMPACT THAT USE </p><p>IS HAVING ON AGRICULTURE. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  05916  02 OF 03  101629Z </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>CONCLUSIONS </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>10. MANAGING LARGE AMOUNTS OF INFORMATION OF RADICALLY </p><p>DIFFERENT TYPES - INCLUDING CONVENTIONAL PRINT SOURCES, </p><p>IMAGES, STATISTICAL DATABASES, INTERACTIVE APPLICATIONS, AND </p><p>MULTIMEDIA RESOURCES - IS A RELATIVELY NEW PROBLEM FOR FAO, </p><p>USAID, AND ALL OTHER MAJOR DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATIONS. </p><p>ATTENTION SHOULD BE DIRECTED TO SUPPORTING THE AGENCIES THAT </p><p>ARE MAKING THE BEST EFFORTS AND TAKING LESSONS FROM THEM </p><p>THAT CAN BE WIDELY APPLIED TO IMPROVE WHAT EACH PLAYER IN </p><p>THIS DOMAIN IS DOING. </p><p> </p><p>11. IN GENERAL, FAO IS WELL PLACED TO WORK ON INTERNATIONAL </p><p>INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTUE, POLICIES AND </p><p>STANDARDS. </p><p> </p><p>12.
