<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 001033 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/08/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINS, EFIN, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: ETHNICITY DRIVING LOCAL POLITICS IN KOGI </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA 829 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter.  Reason: 1.5(b) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) Communal conflict and electoral politics are </p><p>inextricably inter-linked in much of Nigeria.  Paras 13-15 of </p><p>reftel offer a brief general analysis of this insidious </p><p>danger to the country\'s nascent democracy.  There follows a </p><p>specific illustrative case-in-point. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) Nigeria\'s Constitution establishes a formula for </p><p>dividing the money flowing into the Federation Account among </p><p>the three tiers of government -- federal, state and local. </p><p>When one state is divided into two (for example, the division </p><p>of old Bauchi into new Bauchi and Gombe), the two descendant </p><p>states together get more federal revenue than did their </p><p>common ancestor, even though total landmass and population </p><p>are unchanged.  While many factors influence revenue </p><p>allocation (population, land area, tax base, etc.), one key </p><p>criterion has always been "equality of states."  This means a </p><p>significant share of the revenue available for distribution </p><p>to the states (historically 25-30 percent) is divided equally </p><p>among them.  The result is a tendency to divide Nigeria into </p><p>ever more numerous, ever-smaller states.  Since independence, </p><p>Nigeria has gone from three regions, to four, to 12 states, </p><p>to 19, 21, 30, and, most recently, 36. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) The common citizens of the new states get little or </p><p>no benefit from creation of new states.  In fact, they </p><p>usually lose.  Although the two new states together have more </p><p>federally-allocated revenue than their predecessor, demands </p><p>against that revenue are higher still.  Elites come first, </p><p>and that means schools, roads and clinics take a back seat to </p><p>foreign travel, governor\'s mansions, offices, cars and an </p><p>entirely new state-level civil service. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) The growth of government in the past decade has been </p><p>greatest at the local level, however.  While the number of </p><p>states has not quite doubled, local government authorities </p><p>(LGAs) have almost tripled (from 272 to 774).  The same logic </p><p>that drives state creation impels minting new LGAs. </p><p>Moreover, ethnicity concerns, often veiled in state-creation </p><p>debates, are right out in the open.  LGAs get some revenue </p><p>from their states and some from Abuja.  A few LGAs generate </p><p>significant revenue internally, but most would wither and die </p><p>without state and federal money. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) Kogi State Governor Prince Abubakar Audu, an Igala, </p><p>recently decided to create 25 new LGAs (bringing Kogi\'s total </p><p>to 46).  However, the majority of the new LGAs (14) were </p><p>carved out of Igala-land.  Areas dominated by Ibiris and </p><p>Kabbas (the other two major Kogi tribes) together with 11 new </p><p>LGAs, bringing their collective total to 23.  The Igala also </p><p>now have 23, even though they comprise just over one-third of </p><p>the population.  Moreover, Audu put the Ajaokuta steelworks </p><p>in an Igala-dominated LGA, even though Ajaokuta itself is </p><p>traditional Ibiri territory. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) Because resources and patronage flow to LGAs, Kogi\'s </p><p>non-Igala inhabitants were upset.  Okenne, the largest </p><p>Ibiri-dominated town, erupted in violence during the week of </p><p>March 11.  Townspeople ordered the Ibiri Commissioners </p><p>(members of Audu\'s cabinet) to resign.  When they refused, </p><p>their houses were torched.  The Army records unit based at </p><p>Lokoja was called in to restore order and reportedly did so </p><p>without incident. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Unrest has, unfortunately, continued.  There are now </p><p>reports of between four and ten deaths associated with LGA </p><p>creation in Kogi.  Kogi did not follow constitutional </p><p>requirements for creation of new LGAs (see below), but Audu\'s </p><p>Igala kinsmen are unlikely to take kindly to the near-certain </p><p>court ruling against their new patronage vehicles.  More </p><p>unrest is nearly certain.  Meanwhile, Kogi local governance, </p><p>already in disarray because of funding shortfalls and </p><p>corruption, is said now to be in a shambles, with no funds </p><p>for the "take-off" of the new LGAs and the existing ones </p><p>uncertain about the extent of their authority and </p><p>responsibilities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) A number of other states have also created new LGAs, </p><p>among them Ebonyi, Ogun, Niger and Kebbi.  Governor Bola </p><p>Tinubu of Lagos has vowed to do the same.  While the GON had </p><p>refused to acknowledge the new entities, it had heretofore </p><p>trod gently.  Conflict over the creation of new LGAs, or </p><p>control over existing ones, has been a driving force behind </p><p>communal conflict in the Niger Delta.  In the wake of the </p><p>Kogi violence, however, Attorney General Godwin Kanu Agabi </p><p>March 14 declared all new LGAs illegal, claiming that no </p><p>state government had followed proper procedures when </p><p>establishing them.  Whether Agabi\'s declaration will have any </p><p>force of law remains to be seen.  A court in Ebonyi ruled </p><p>against the state government March 21 because it, like Kogi, </p><p>manifestly failed to meet the constitution\'s requirements. </p><p>However, Niger appears to have taken the proper </p><p>constitutional course, and Agabi\'s rejection of its new LGAs </p><p>would appear more difficult to justify.  Continued resort to </p><p>the courts is certain, though broad and authoritative </p><p>decisions are doubtless many months away.  Meanwhile, </p><p>governors who see their political futures enhanced by LGA </p><p>creation will likely ignore Agabi and blame any resource </p><p>shortfalls on the federal government. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
