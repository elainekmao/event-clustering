<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 OTTAWA 001061 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR WGSARS, OES/PCI, WHA/CAN (RUNNING) </p><p> </p><p>HHS FOR OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY, OFFICE OF </p><p>INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS (STEIGER) </p><p> </p><p>CDC for Global Health Office (Cox) and Epidemiology </p><p>Program Office </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: TBIO, AMED, CA, Health, SARS </p><p>SUBJECT: WGSARS: Canada-wide Status Report April 11 </p><p>(Number 2) </p><p> </p><p>Ref. (A) Ottawa 1043 (SARS Canada-wide Report #1) </p><p> </p><p>     (B) Toronto 1048 (Ontario SARS Health Emergency) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. Health Canada reports 253 probable or suspect cases </p><p>across Canada, a net increase of 9.  Health Canada, as </p><p>a precaution, has asked blood collection agencies not </p><p>to accept blood donations from those who have traveled </p><p>outside Canada to SARS affected regions, or have been </p><p>to a facility under SARS quarantine in Canada.  Also, </p><p>during flights from SARS affected regions, all </p><p>passengers will be asked to fill out a "traveler </p><p>tracing" form to provide to Canadian authorities upon </p><p>arrival to facilitate passenger and health authority </p><p>contact.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Figures </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>2. As of 13:00 EDT, April 10, 2003, Health Canada has </p><p>received reports of 253 probable or suspect cases of </p><p>severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Canada. </p><p>The distributions of the cases to date are as follows: </p><p>  -- Ontario is reporting 95 probable and 111 suspect </p><p>  cases.  All cases have occurred in persons who have </p><p>  traveled to Asia or had contact with SARS cases in </p><p>  the household or in a health-care setting. (See </p><p>  Toronto reporting for more detail on the situation </p><p>  in Ontario). </p><p>  -- British Columbia is reporting 3 probable and 32 </p><p>  suspect cases. </p><p>  -- New Brunswick is reporting 2 suspect cases. </p><p>  -- Saskatchewan is reporting 1 suspect case. </p><p>  -- Alberta is reporting 5 suspect cases. </p><p>  -- Prince Edward Island is reporting 4 suspect </p><p>  cases. </p><p> </p><p>3. Fatalities: </p><p> </p><p>  -- No change: 10, all clustered in Toronto, Ontario. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>Protecting Canada\'s Blood Supply </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  As a precautionary measure to protect the blood </p><p>supply in Canada and recipients from the possible </p><p>threat of SARS, Health Canada has directed the Canadian </p><p>Blood Service and Hma-Quebec to temporarily exclude </p><p>persons who meet the following profile from donating </p><p>blood (for a period of 10 days): </p><p>  -- traveled within the previous 10 days to an </p><p>  affected area outside Canada. The affected areas are </p><p>  currently: China, including the Hong Kong Special </p><p>  Administrative Region; Hanoi, Vietnam; Singapore and </p><p>  Taiwan; </p><p>  -- been a patient, worked in, or visited a facility </p><p>  that is under quarantine for SARS. </p><p> </p><p>5. Health Canada has also requested that provincial </p><p>public health officials, when investigating possible </p><p>SARS cases, ask whether the individual has donated </p><p>blood.  If the individual has donated blood within 10 </p><p>days prior to the first day of symptoms, public health </p><p>officials are asked to notify Canadian Blood Services </p><p>and Hma-Qubec.  In such cases the donor\'s blood and </p><p>blood products will be withdrawn from inventory. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>Information to trace travelers </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. Beginning Thursday, April 10th, as an added </p><p>precautionary measure, Health Canada has arranged for </p><p>in-flight distribution of a health alert card to </p><p>passengers on all direct flights to Canada from Hong </p><p>Kong, Singapore and Beijing. </p><p> </p><p>7. Flight attendants will also ask passengers to fill </p><p>out a traveler tracing form (also known as contact </p><p>information cards) that will enable health authorities </p><p>to contact passengers over a two-week period after </p><p>their arrival in Canada, if necessary.  These forms </p><p>must be filled out before clearing customs.  Upon </p><p>arrival, Health Canada staff will gather these contact </p><p>forms from passengers.  Health Canada anticipates that </p><p>this in-flight distribution will also be expanded to </p><p>direct flights from other Asian destinations in the </p><p>near future - but no details are as yet available. </p><p> </p><p>Cellucci </p><p></p></div>
