<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001222 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR INR/R/MR AND AF/PDPA DALTON, MITCHELL AND SIMS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, KMDR, OIIP, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION IRAQ; HARARE </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under headline "Bombing out Iraq\'s ruins" the </p><p>      pro-government weekly "The Sunday Mirror" dedicated </p><p>      its June 15 editorial to calling on the United </p><p>      States "to ship out" of Iraq and "hand over the </p><p>      country to its rightful owners" - the Iraqis. </p><p>      Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   ". . .While the global media was awash with images of </p><p>      ululating Iraqis, celebrating the removal of Saddam </p><p>      Hussein, there is no way they can hide from the world that </p><p>      Iraqis simply want the Americans to ship out.  For the U. </p><p>      S. to insist on a post-Iraq program that seeks to </p><p>      perpetuate their stay in and control over the country is an </p><p>      insult to sovereign people who wish for nothing more than </p><p>      to define their own existence.  We register our concern </p><p>      over sentiments expressed by the more conservative and </p><p>      hawkish sections of the George W. Bush administration </p><p>      calling for more troops to be poured into Iraq.  For, what </p><p>      is clear is that no amount of military presence by the </p><p>      Americans will quench the Iraq people\'s growing opposition </p><p>      to the continued occupation of their country.  In fact, it </p><p>      is our view that any escalation of U. S. military presence </p><p>      will spur the rise of nationalist groups actively </p><p>      challenging the unwelcome presence of the American forces. </p><p>      What should inform the U. S. program on post-war Iraq is </p><p>      the imperative to hand over the country to its rightful </p><p>      owners.  To argue that Iraq needs to be managed by external </p><p>      forces for a longer period before the Iraqis themselves </p><p>      mature to the task of self-governance is simply arrogant </p><p>      and smacks of hegemonic ulterior motives." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
