<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L BOGOTA 007805 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 8/28/11 </p><p>TAGS: MOPS, MARR, PTER, PGOV, PREL ,CO </p><p>SUBJECT: UPDATE ON OPERATION SEVENTH OF AUGUST </p><p> </p><p>REF: BOGOTA 7555 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR ANNE W. PATTERSON; REASONS 1.5 </p><p>(B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) AS REPORTED REFTEL, ON AUGUST 17 THE COLOMBIAN </p><p>MILITARY LAUNCHED A HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL JOINT ARMY/AIR </p><p>FORCE OPERATION TO DESTROY MOBILE FARC UNITS SEEKING TO </p><p>ATTACK MILITARY TARGETS IN META AND GUAVIARE DEPARTMENTS. </p><p>ON AUGUST 27, FARC SUPREME MILITARY COMMANDER "MONO </p><p>JOJOY" PUBLICLY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT ALIAS "URIAS CUELLAR," </p><p>HIS RIGHT-HAND MILITARY STRATEGIST HAD BEEN KILLED BY THE </p><p>ARMY.  ALTHOUGH "JOJOY" DOWNPLAYED THE NUMBER OF FARC </p><p>CASUALTIES, THE ARMY HAS RECOVERED THE BODIES OF AT LEAST </p><p>20 FARC COMBATANTS.  THERE ARE CREDIBLE REPORTS THAT THE </p><p>BODIES OF AT LEAST ANOTHER 80 FARC COMBATANTS WERE BURIED </p><p>OR HIDDEN BY FARC UNITS AS THEY FLED FROM ARMY PURSUIT. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) ARMED FORCES COMMANDER GEN. TAPIAS HAS ANNOUNCED </p><p>THAT OPERATION "SEVENTH OF AUGUST" WILL CONTINUE AS THE </p><p>ARMY PURSUES AND ENCIRCLES REMNANTS OF THE FARC COLUMNS, </p><p>NUMBERING SOME 1,300 FARC REGULARS.  ARMY COMMANDER </p><p>GENERAL MORA ORDERED AN ADDITIONAL 500 TROOPS COMMITTED </p><p>TO THE OPERATION; THESE TROOPS ARE NOW POSTED AT </p><p>STRATEGIC LOCATIONS DESIGNED TO PREVENT ELEMENTS OF THE </p><p>FARC FORCE FROM ESCAPING BACK TO THE FARC DEMILITARIZED </p><p>ZONE ("ZONA DE DESPEJE").  SOME FARC REGULARS ARE </p><p>SPLITTING INTO SMALL GROUPS IN AN EFFORT TO EVADE </p><p>DETECTION. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) MILITARY SOURCES ADD THAT CURRENT EFFORTS ARE </p><p>FOCUSING ON PSYOPS DESIGNED TO ENCOURAGE THE FARC </p><p>COMBATANTS TO SURRENDER.  THESE OPERATIONS CONSIST MAINLY </p><p>OF DROPPING LEAFLETS ARGUING THAT IT IS BETTER TO </p><p>SURRENDER TO THE MILITARY, WHO TAKES GOOD CARE OF ITS </p><p>PRISONERS, THAN BE KILLED IN ACTION.  FARC MORALE IN THE </p><p>AREA IS REPORTEDLY LOW, AND THE COLOMBIAN MILITARY IS </p><p>ATTEMPTING TO PRESS ITS ADVANTAGE.  FARC COMBATANTS ARE </p><p>SAID TO BE STARVING AS A RESULT OF THE MILITARY\'S SEIZURE </p><p>EARLY IN THE OPERATION OF AT LEAST EIGHT TONS OF RATIONS </p><p>DESTINED FOR THEM; AS MANY AS 30 GUERRILLAS HAVE ALREADY </p><p>DESERTED, ACCORDING TO INTELLIGENCE SOURCES. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>COMMENT: </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) BY ALL ACCOUNTS, OPERATION "SEVENTH OF AUGUST" </p><p>WILL LIKELY TURN OUT TO BE THE COLOMBIAN ARMED FORCES </p><p>MOST SUCCESSFUL OPERATION AGAINST THE FARC IN RECENT </p><p>YEARS.  AS THE ARMY CONTINUES TO ENCIRCLE THE FLEEING </p><p>FARC REGULARS AND THEIR FOOD SUPPLIES CONTINUE TO </p><p>DWINDLE, THE ARMY\'S PSYOPS SHOULD PAY DIVIDENDS AS FARC </p><p>SOLDIERS COME OUT OF THE BUSH TO SURRENDER. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) THERE ARE REPORTS FROM SEVERAL FARC SOLDIERS WHO </p><p>SURRENDERED EARLIER THAT THERE ARE MANY FARC WOMEN AND </p><p>MINORS AMONG THOSE WISHING TO SURRENDER.  IF, IN FACT, A </p><p>SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF MINORS SURRENDER, THIS OPERATION </p><p>COULD DEAL ANOTHER MAJOR BLOW TO THE FARC\'S INTERNATIONAL </p><p>IMAGE.  AT THE SAME TIME, THIS OPERATION IS BEING </p><p>CONDUCTED IN TERRAIN THAT MIGHT PERMIT THE GUERRILLAS TO </p><p>SLIP THROUGH THE ARMY\'S BLOCKING POSITIONS AND THUS ALLOW </p><p>THE FARC COMBATANTS TO RETURN TO THEIR SANCTUARY IN THE </p><p>DESPEJE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PATTERSON </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
