<p>S E C R E T NDJAMENA 00848 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, CD, LY, FR </p><p>SUBJECT: QADHAFI THREATENS DEBY </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) NDJAMENA 795, (B) NDJAMENA 800 </p><p> </p><p>1.  SECRET - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p>- </p><p>2. SUMMARY:  QADHAFI WARNED DEBY DURING LATTER\'S RECENT </p><p>VISIT TO LIBYA THAT THERE COULD BE NO STABILITY IN CHAD </p><p>IF BILATERAL RELATIONS DID NOT REMAIN POSITIVE. </p><p>BILATERAL RELATIONS WITH FRANCE ARE GOOD AND DEBY IS </p><p>INCREASINGLY AWARE OF THE NEED TO BE FLEXIBLE ON </p><p>DOMESTIC POLITICAL ISSUES, ACCORDING TO DEPARTING </p><p>FRENCH AMBASSADOR.  END SUMMARY. </p><p>- </p><p>3.  ALONG WITH MANY OTHER WELL-WISHERS, I WAS AT </p><p>N\'DJAMENA AIRPORT AT NOON TODAY, FEBRUARY 26, TO SAY </p><p>FAREWELL TO DEPARTING FRENCH AMBASSADOR GENDREAU.  HE </p><p>PULLED ME ASIDE TO NOTE POINTS MADE BY PRESIDENT DEBY </p><p>IN THEIR FINAL MEETING EARLIER THE SAME MORNING. </p><p>ACCORDING TO GENDREAU, AT THEIR MEETING IN BENGHAZI </p><p>LAST WEEK, QADHAFI ESSENTIALLY THREATENED DEBY WITH </p><p>DESTABILIZATION IF CHAD DID NOT MAINTAIN FRIENDLY </p><p>RELATIONS WITH LIBYA.  QADHAFI REFERRED TO THE </p><p>INGRATITUDE OF EARLIER CHADIAN LEADERS AND NOT SO </p><p>SUBTLY INDICATED TO DEBY THAT HE COULD MAKE TROUBLE IF </p><p>DEBY FOLLOWED SUIT.  GENDREAU SAID THAT DEBY RESENTED </p><p>THIS LANGUAGE AND REMAINS ON GUARD TOWARDS QADHAFI AND </p><p>LIBYA. </p><p>- </p><p>4.  GENDREAU ALSO COMMENTED ON CHAD-FRANCE RELATIONS </p><p>WHICH HE CHARACTERIZED AS GOOD, AND HE ADDED THAT LOCAL </p><p>FRENCH BUSINESSMEN, ESPECIALLY THE SMALLER MERCHANTS, </p><p>SAY THEY NOTE AN IMPROVED ATTITUDE OF CHADIAN </p><p>AUTHORITIES TOWARD THEM.  IN RESPONSE TO MY COMMENT </p><p>REGARDING DEBY\'S NEED TO DEAL WITH EMERGING DOMESTIC </p><p>POLITICAL PROBLEMS, GENDREAU SAID THAT THE CHADIAN </p><p>PRESIDENT IS INCREASINGLY AWARE OF THE NEED FOR </p><p>FLEXIBILITY IN THIS AREA. </p><p>- </p><p>5.  COMMENT:  THIS WAS A HURRIED CONVERSATION THAT DID </p><p>NOT ALLOW TIME TO EXPLORE THE POINTS MADE BY GENDREAU. </p><p>AS INDICATED REF (A), THE CHADIANS WHO ACCOMPANIED DEBY </p><p>TO BENGHAZI WITH WHOM WE HAVE SPOKEN HAVE INDICATED </p><p>THAT DEBY\'S SUBSTANTIVE DISCUSSIONS WERE ONLY PARTLY </p><p>SUCCESSFUL.  IT IS NOT CLEAR, HOWEVER, WHETHER GENDREAU </p><p>WAS REFERRING TO QADHAFI\'S MENACING SPEECH OR REMARKS </p><p>MADE PRIVATELY TO DEBY.  IN ANY CASE, GENDREAU\'S REPORT </p><p>SUGGESTS THAT DEBY AND QADHAFI DID NOT ESTABLISH A GOOD </p><p>PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP.  WE ARE SOMEWHAT SURPRISED BY </p><p>GENDREAU\'S COMMENTS ON THE MOOD OF FRENCH BUSINESSMEN </p><p>HERE SINCE BUSINESS ACTIVITY IS AT A STANDSTILL. </p><p>HOWEVER, THE FRENCH GENERALLY PROBABLY FEEL LESS </p><p>HOSTILITY FROM THE GOC THAN WHEN HABRE WAS IN POWER. </p><p>ON DOMESTIC ISSUES, IT MAY BE THAT BY NOW DEBY IS </p><p>RESPONDING TO INTENSIFYING PRESSURE FROM SOUTHERNERS </p><p>AND OTHERS TO KEEP HIS PROMISES REGARDING </p><p>DEMOCRATIZATION, BUT SO FAR THERE IS LITTLE TANGIBLE </p><p>PROOF OF SUCH AN ATTITUDE REPORTED BACK TO US BY OTHER </p><p>SOURCES, OTHER THAN DEBY\'S OWN INNER CIRCLE.  (REF B). </p><p>- </p><p>6.  MINIMIZE CONSIDERED. </p><p> </p><p>BOGOSIAN </p><p></p></div>
