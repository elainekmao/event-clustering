<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 001709 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/18/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PINS, MOPS, MARR, TU, IZ, Iraq </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY/IRAQ: MOVING TOWARD APPROVAL OF U.S. </p><p>OVERFLIGHTS </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador W.R. Pearson; reasons: 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) In separate meetings March 17-18, ruling AK party </p><p>parliamentary group deputy chairman Salih Kapusuz; former </p><p>President Demirel\'s right-hand-man Muharrem Ozguven; Director </p><p>General of Turkish Customs (and AK party member) Nevzat </p><p>Saygilioglu; and Faruk Demir, executive director of a </p><p>think-tank with deep contacts in the Presidency and Prime </p><p>Ministry, told us the GOT intends to have parliament pass an </p><p>Iraq operation-related resolution March 19 or 20.  Demir told </p><p>us afternoon March 18 that, based on his conversations with </p><p>the Prime Ministry, the Cabinet will consider three draft </p><p>resolutions evening March 18: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(a) same text as the resolution permitting U.S. land </p><p>deployment and Turkish forces\' deployment abroad which failed </p><p>a parliamentary vote March 1; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(b) a text granting the U.S. air corridors and uses of bases </p><p>(no ground deployment) plus Turkish deployment abroad; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(c) a text granting the U.S. air corridors only plus Turkish </p><p>deployment abroad. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In emphasizing that there is a new sense of fear and urgency </p><p>in the AK leadership, Demir told us his Prime Ministry </p><p>sources say the choice will be (b) or (c). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) When we called on Kapusuz March 18 he was about to </p><p>chair an AK parliamentary group meeting to discuss the draft </p><p>resolution.  His group\'s M.P.s remain under strong pressure </p><p>from constituents to oppose cooperation with the U.S., </p><p>Kapusuz asserted.  He therefore angled for the U.S. to give </p><p>him a trump card by bringing the $6 billion economic package </p><p>back to the table ("without re-opening it," he hastily tried </p><p>to add).  March 17 General Director of Customs Saygilioglu </p><p>also pressed us to make a gesture by putting the economic </p><p>package back in play.  Without commenting on the package we </p><p>told both interlocutors that Washington is looking only at </p><p>what action the GOT will take. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) We understand Kapusuz focused the AK M.P.s attention </p><p>on the need to pass a resolution; the content is not </p><p>important, he reportedly said, but a resolution is essential. </p><p> Following the AK group meeting Kapusuz declared publicly </p><p>that there will be no group decision on the vote; as during </p><p>the failed March 1 vote on a broader land-deployment </p><p>resolution, AK M.P.s will be free to vote as they wish.  Main </p><p>opposition CHP leader Baykal, whose gratuitous opposition to </p><p>cooperation with the U.S. on Iraq has set a new benchmark for </p><p>mendacity, has also announced that he is freeing his M.P.s </p><p>from the previous group decision to oppose any resolution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Comment: In AK party circles, talk has often been </p><p>cheap, as we have frequently seen.  The cabinet may be </p><p>flirting with options that would enable Turkey to try to </p><p>persuade the U.S. to reinstate the full economic, political, </p><p>and military package.  If so, they may/may now be moving for </p><p>three reasons: (a) the military operation is virtually </p><p>certain; (b) the TGS has spoken out -- twice now; and (c) the </p><p>markets are headed for real instability. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
