<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 SANAA 001451 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/23/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PBTS, PREL, PTER, PGOV, SA, YM, COUNTER TERRORISM </p><p>SUBJECT: MINISTER OF INTERIOR ON YEMEN-SAUDI SECURITY </p><p>COOPERATION </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Charge Alan G. Misenheimer for Reasons 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  Begin summary:  On June 21, Charge met with Minister </p><p>of Interior Alimi to discuss recent developments in </p><p>Yemen-Saudi border security, Red Sea counter-terrorism </p><p>cooperation, press reports of Yemeni terrorist arrested in </p><p>Saudi Arabia, and other issues.  The Charge was accompanied </p><p>by RSO and PolOff.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>Yemen-Saudi Arabia Border Security </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  During a 6/21 meeting with Minister of Interior, Dr. </p><p>Rashad Alimi, Charge asked him to discuss the recent </p><p>Yemen-Saudi border agreement and its implications for </p><p>improved border security.  Alimi noted that Yemen-Saudi </p><p>border cooperation is complicated by populations that </p><p>straddle the border and flow freely from one side to the </p><p>other.  The border security agreement between the two </p><p>countries established several committees to manage this </p><p>phenomenon, but controlling the flow of "cars and lambs" </p><p>around the border towns is very difficult.  Smuggling remains </p><p>a major problem; some groups are able to bypass ROYG </p><p>checkpoints crossing from Yemen\'s Hadramut region into Saudi </p><p>Arabia, and vice versa. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  Overall, Alimi described Yemen-Saudi border </p><p>cooperation as strong and improving.  The joint committees </p><p>are responsive to changes in the situation and meet whenever </p><p>Yemeni or Saudi Arabia desires.  Since the recent terrorist </p><p>attacks in Riyadh, Alimi feels there is a heightened Saudi </p><p>commitment to security throughout the Kingdom. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Noting that the Minister of Defense was unable to </p><p>attend a scheduled 6/17 meeting in order to deal with a </p><p>security incident near Marib, Charge asked whether terrorist </p><p>suspects had been arrested. Alimi explained that the incident </p><p>was not terror-related, but criminal.  A group of criminals </p><p>in Saudi broke a colleague out of police custody and fled </p><p>across the border into Yemen.  Saudi Armed Forces, not </p><p>police, followed the fugitives about 240 kilometers into </p><p>Yemen, killing one during the exchange of gunfire which </p><p>ensued.  The fugitives car later overturned in the desert. </p><p>The remaining suspects ran off and remain at large.  The </p><p>Minister of Defense went to Marib for talks with his Saudi </p><p>Defense counterpart after this "hot pursuit." </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  According to Alimi, ROYG considers the incident the </p><p>sort of territorial infringement that underscores the need </p><p>for cooperation.  The ROYG asked the Saudis to ensure that it </p><p>does not happen again, "Yemen will take care of the Yemeni </p><p>side of the border, but we accepted their apology." </p><p> </p><p>6. (C)  In response to the Charge\'s query on recent press </p><p>reports of Yemeni terrorists arrested in Saudi Arabia, Alimi </p><p>noted that two people were arrested with false Yemeni </p><p>passports, but are now believed to be Egyptians.  The ROYG is </p><p>currently seeking the extradition of about 100 Yemenis in </p><p>Saudi Arabia for criminal prosecution. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>Qatari and Djiboutian Cooperation </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  Alimi indicated that there was no direct CT </p><p>discussions during the recent visits of the Djiboutian </p><p>President or the Qatari Emir to Yemen.  However, Qatar has an </p><p>active  CT agreement with Yemen and works with all its </p><p>neighbors on Red Sea security -- a top ROYG priority.  That </p><p>security requires an effective Coast Guard reporting to the </p><p>MOI.  Alimi then repeated a familiar refrain - Yemen needs </p><p>financial assistance to defray the Coast Guard\'s $100 million </p><p>plus price tag.  The Saudis have not been forthcoming - </p><p>during Alimi\'s last trip to the Kingdom, they told him that </p><p>the U.S. should assist the Coast Guard because of Yemen\'s </p><p>cooperation in the war on terror. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>And Now, About Our Cars... </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  Charge thanked Alimi for MOI\'s commitment to the </p><p>security of American interests in Yemen, and reiterated the </p><p>need for continued vigilance.  Alimi agreed to look into some </p><p>administrative delays that affect Embassy security including </p><p>non-diplomatic license plates for Embassy vehicles and an </p><p>18-car backlog of privately owned vehicles for mission </p><p>personnel at Hodeidah port. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MISENHEIMER </p><p></p></div>
