<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 04 ABUJA 001533 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF AND INL </p><p>DOJ FOR OPDAT: JIM SILVERWOOD AND OIA: JASON CARTER </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, KCRM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: A CLOSE LOOK AT THE GON\'S ANTI-CORRUPTION </p><p>COMMISSION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA 1305 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED - PLEASE HANDLE ACCORDINGLY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Assistant U.S. Attorney Susan DeWitt visited Abuja </p><p>June 11 </p><p>- 29 as part of an INL-funded U.S. Department of Justice </p><p>Overseas </p><p>Prosecution Development and Training (OPDAT) program to work </p><p>with </p><p>Nigeria,s fledgling Anti-Corruption Commission and design </p><p>possible training assistance to this important GON entity. </p><p>DeWitt,s visit came against the backdrop of Nigeria being </p><p>identified by respected international NGO "Transparency </p><p>International" as the world,s second most corrupt country. </p><p>The </p><p>following reflect DeWitt,s expert observations made during </p><p>her </p><p>three weeks spent with Commission prosecutors and its </p><p>management. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) The Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related </p><p>Offenses Commission (ICPC) recently filed its first two cases </p><p>in </p><p>the High Court in Abuja.  In both matters, the defendants </p><p>filed </p><p>motions challenging the constitutionality of the </p><p>anti-corruption </p><p>act, which the trial court denied.  In both cases, the </p><p>defendants </p><p>also filed interlocutory appeals of the trial court,s denial </p><p>of </p><p>these motions, which the Court of Appeals also denied. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) The first case concerned an attempt by five </p><p>defendants </p><p>to bribe the Special Assistant to the Chairman of the ICPC </p><p>with </p><p>350,000 naira (approximately USD 3,000) to destroy two </p><p>petitions </p><p>that had been filed with the ICPC against some of the </p><p>defendants. </p><p> The action was filed in May and the trial started in early </p><p>June. </p><p>It is expected to be completed within the next week.  The </p><p>second </p><p>case involves a 3,500,000 naira (approximately USD 35,000) </p><p>bribe </p><p>given to a member of the Judicial Commission of Inquiry for </p><p>the </p><p>investigation of the Management of Nigeria Airways Limited </p><p>and </p><p>other members of this commission to show "favour" to the head </p><p>of </p><p>a local company.  The trial in this matter was scheduled to </p><p>start </p><p>on June 28, but a second motion to stay the trial was filed </p><p>and </p><p>is now pending before the trial court.  The prior appeal of </p><p>this </p><p>matter was also appealed to the Supreme Court and a hearing </p><p>is </p><p>expected to take place in the next few days. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Crustacean Courtroom Pace </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Since there are no court reporters or recording </p><p>equipment in Nigerian courts, the proceedings are very slow. </p><p>Although the amount of notes of proceedings taken by judges </p><p>in </p><p>Nigeria apparently varies somewhat from judge-to-judge and </p><p>case- </p><p>to-case, the judge in these matters appears to be taking down </p><p>most of the proceeding almost verbatim to prepare the </p><p>"written </p><p>note" or record of the trial.  The judge presiding over these </p><p>two </p><p>cases, who is one of two judges designated to hear all anti- </p><p>corruption matters in Abuja, seems very knowledgeable, even- </p><p>handed and fair.  He made a good record on his rulings and </p><p>controlled the courtroom, but did not interfere with the </p><p>parties </p><p>presentation of their respective cases.  He was clearly </p><p>trying to </p><p>push the case forward in a timely manner and was working very </p><p>hard to do so.  Even so the proceedings were delayed by </p><p>numerous </p><p>motions and defense requests for adjournment.  The prosecutor </p><p>also seemed well prepared and was able to effectively present </p><p>the </p><p>case. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) The Anti-Corruption Act requires that prosecutions </p><p>be </p><p>completed within 90 days from the date of arraignment, unless </p><p>there is "good reason" for it to take longer.  The defense </p><p>attorneys in both of these matters appear to be testing the </p><p>limits of this requirement. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Commission Procedure and Structure </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) The ICPC has received more than 100 petitions, some </p><p>of </p><p>which have been referred to other agencies for appropriate </p><p>action </p><p>and some of which have been determined to be frivolous or </p><p>lacking </p><p>in prima facie evidence of an offense.  The remaining </p><p>petitions </p><p>are being considered further.  Several petitions have been </p><p>referred to ICPC investigators for further investigation and </p><p>it </p><p>is anticipated that they will result in additional </p><p>prosecutions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) The ICPC has five prosecutors on loan from the </p><p>Ministry </p><p>of Justice, and ten investigators, also on loan.  The ICPC </p><p>hopes </p><p>to hire its own staff, including investigators, starting in </p><p>the </p><p>next couple of months.  The ICPC hired an outside consultant </p><p>to </p><p>prepare an applicant questionnaire so that applicants could </p><p>be </p><p>"objectively screened."  After the screening, selected </p><p>applicants </p><p>will be interviewed for staff positions.  An applicant </p><p>examination is scheduled to take place on Saturday, June 30, </p><p>2001, and approximately 27,000 people have applied for the </p><p>approximately 90 positions with the ICPC. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) As of this time, no attorneys have been hired in any </p><p>of </p><p>the States, but two anti-corruption judges have been selected </p><p>in </p><p>each of the 36 States and the ICPC is receiving petitions </p><p>from </p><p>various States, not just the Federal Capital Territory.  No </p><p>offices have been set up in any of the 36 States or Six Zones </p><p>(except the FCT), so petitions must be delivered directly to </p><p>the </p><p>ICPC offices in Abuja. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) Recently, the ICPC set up three subcommittees: (1) a </p><p>legal review committee, which is tasked with reviewing the </p><p>petitions filed with the ICPC and deciding which cases to </p><p>further </p><p>investigate and prosecute; (2) a public outreach and </p><p>education </p><p>committee, which is tasked with both public education on anti- </p><p>corruption issues and also public relations for the ICPC; and </p><p>(3) </p><p>a government procedures and policies committee, which is </p><p>tasked </p><p>with examining the practices, systems and procedures of </p><p>public </p><p>bodies and to make proposed changes on ways to reduce and </p><p>prevent </p><p>corruption and fraud in those bodies.  Each member of the </p><p>ICPC is </p><p>on at least one sub-committee, and each subcommittee has at </p><p>least </p><p>four members. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Looking for Good Targets </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) Professor Uche Modum, one of the ICPC members, </p><p>asked </p><p>AUSA DeWitt informally for advise on how to get information </p><p>regarding corrupt individuals that she reads about in the </p><p>paper. </p><p>DeWitt explained to her the concept of "pro-active </p><p>investigations," and how these are conducted in the United </p><p>States, often taking months or even years to investigate. </p><p>(Comment:  Modum appeared to be attempting to find out how </p><p>the </p><p>ICPC could get access to U.S. intelligence on corrupt </p><p>officials </p><p>in Nigeria.  End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU) When meeting with the ICPC as a group, DeWitt </p><p>raised </p><p>the concept of pro-active investigations.  Chairman Akanbi </p><p>advised that all investigations must start with a written </p><p>petition to the ICPC, or an oral report to the ICPC that is </p><p>then </p><p>reduced to writing.  He seemed very resistant to the concept </p><p>of </p><p>pro-active investigations.  Although the Anti-Corruption Act </p><p>does </p><p>contain a provision that indicates that investigations start </p><p>from </p><p>written petitions, this interpretation places serious </p><p>limitation </p><p>on the work of the ICPC.  Also, other provisions in the Act </p><p>appear to give the ICPC broader investigatory powers. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Future USG Assistance </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (SBU) The ICPC currently appears overwhelmed by foreign </p><p>visitors and offers of assistance.  U.S. efforts should be </p><p>coordinated in some manner to avoid over-load.  Also, to some </p><p>extent, the ICPC has to and wants to work through their </p><p>issues on </p><p>their own, so that should be taken into consideration in </p><p>connection with U.S. offers of assistance.  Assistance aimed </p><p>at </p><p>staff capacity-building, rather than policy advice, will </p><p>likely </p><p>be more readily accepted and could be timed to correspond to </p><p>the </p><p>hiring of permanent staff.  On the legal side, the </p><p>investigators </p><p>could benefit from further training by U.S. investigators, </p><p>and </p><p>more importantly, the ICPC would use an advisor on how to </p><p>train </p><p>their own investigators and how to develop standards and </p><p>codes of </p><p>conduct for both prosecutors and investigators. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (SBU) The ICPC could use specialized outside assistance </p><p>during this developmental phase, especially when they get </p><p>staff </p><p>hired.  Specifically, AUSA DeWitt recommends that we find </p><p>professionals with expertise in each of the areas for which </p><p>the </p><p>Commission has formed sub-committees.  An expert in civil </p><p>service </p><p>reform could work with staff and members of the corruption </p><p>prevention sub-committee on model civil service processes and </p><p>procedures.  Similarly, an expert on community outreach and </p><p>public relations could provide invaluable assistance to the </p><p>public outreach sub-committee and its staff.  In addition, </p><p>the </p><p>AUSA believes that the ICPC would use assistance in setting </p><p>up </p><p>administrative and accounting procedures. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. (SBU)  Help could also be offered to members of the </p><p>ICPC in making contacts with counterparts on anti- </p><p>corruption commissions in other countries that have </p><p>succeeded, such as Botswana, Hong Kong and Singapore, and, </p><p>if possible, to even pair members of these others </p><p>commissions with the heads of the three sub-committees set- </p><p>up within the ICPC. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15. (SBU) The ICPC continues to move extremely slow in </p><p>getting itself established.  It has a grossly inadequate </p><p>budget for the task at hand, and still does not have a full </p><p>and/or permanent staff.  The prosecutors assigned to the </p><p>ICPC are a mixed group in term of experience and </p><p>capabilities.  Some have several years of prosecution </p><p>experience while others have little prosecution experience </p><p>but have experience with civil litigation.  All five </p><p>prosecutors seem diligent and dedicated to their work, </p><p>although five prosecutors will not be able to handle the </p><p>work of the Commission in 36 States.  Until it get its own </p><p>prosecutors, the ICPC plans to use the five prosecutors </p><p>loaned to them while hiring attorneys in different States, </p><p>temporarily and as needed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16. (SBU) There are several possible reasons the Commission </p><p>is moving slowly.  First, setting up this type of </p><p>Commission anew is a slow and difficult process under the </p><p>best of circumstances.  Second, the ICPC simply does not </p><p>have a sufficient budget.  Third, up to now, it does not </p><p>appear that Chairman Akanbi has delegated much </p><p>responsibility to other Commission members.  He appears by </p><p>nature to be a careful and methodical person and the </p><p>possible threat of corruption within the ICPC is probably </p><p>in the forefront of his concerns, particularly at this </p><p>early stage of the ICPC,s history. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>17. (SBU) These concerns are magnified by the fact that </p><p>most of the current ICPC staffing (and all of the </p><p>investigators and prosecutors) are on loan from other </p><p>offices and are not controlled or selected by the ICPC. </p><p>The Chairman is slowly making changes and introducing new </p><p>ideas to the other Commission members, in part because he </p><p>is not sure whom he can trust on the Commission and in part </p><p>to maintain the quality of the process.  These factors, </p><p>combined with the usual logistical problems in Nigeria, </p><p>mean that it will probably take a couple of years for the </p><p>ICPC to be fully functioning. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
