AFTER THE BILATERAL TRADE AGREEMENT JOINT COMMITTEE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HO CHI  00538  01 OF 03  211143Z </p><p>MEETING IN HANOI, MEMBERS OF THE US DELEGATION SPENT A DAY </p><p>IN HCMC FOCUSING ON INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS (IPR) IN </p><p>THE COUNTRY\'S ECONOMIC HUB.  LOCAL OFFICIALS INDICATED THEY </p><p>ARE AWARE OF IPR PROBLEMS AND ARE TRYING TO FIND WAYS TO </p><p>ADDRESS THEM.  VIETNAMESE BUSINESSPEOPLE COMPLAIN THAT </p><p>RAMPANT IPR VIOLATIONS ARE HURTING THEIR BOTTOM LINE. </p><p>HOWEVER, PIRATED PRODUCTS, PARTICULARLY OPTICAL DISCS </p><p>PRODUCED IN CHINA, ARE WIDELY AVAILABLE THROUGHOUT HCMC. </p><p>ENFORCEMENT, SPLIT AMONG SEVERAL DIFFERENT AGENCIES, IS </p><p>UNCOORDINATED AND INEFFECTUAL.  THE DELEGATION STRESSED TO </p><p>LOCAL OFFICIALS THAT IPR ENFORCEMENT WAS A KEY COMMITMENT IN </p><p>THE BTA, AND IMPORTANT TO ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, A SENTIMENT </p><p>WITH WHICH HCMC OFFICIALS EXPRESSED AGREEMENT.  THE DAY </p><p>ENDED WITH A VISIT TO HCMC\'S "HARD ROCK CAF" WHICH US </p><p>RIGHTS-HOLDERS HAVE BEEN TRYING - UNSUCCESSFULLY - TO CLOSE </p><p>DOWN FOR MORE THAN A YEAR.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>DELEGATION STRESSES NEED TO PROTECT IPR </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>2.  AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE FIRST MEETING OF THE JOINT </p><p>COMMITTEE OF THE BILATERAL TRADE AGREEMENT (BTA), MEMBERS OF </p><p>THE US DELEGATION FROM USTR, STATE, COMMERCE, AND THE </p><p>COPYRIGHT OFFICE JOINED CONGEN ECONOFFS IN HO CHI MINH CITY </p><p>TO REVIEW THE IPR SITUATION IN THE CITY.  THE DELEGATION </p><p>REINFORCED THE MESSAGE DELIVERED IN HANOI: IMPROVING IPR </p><p>PROTECTION WAS A KEY BTA COMMITMENT, INTEGRAL TO THE WTO </p><p>ACCESSION PROCESS, AND VITAL TO VIETNAM\'S ECONOMIC </p><p>DEVELOPMENT.  NOT SURPRISINGLY, VIETNAMESE OFFICIALS - AT </p><p>THE DEPARTMENT OF TRADE, THE MARKET MANAGEMENT BOARD, AND </p><p>THE DEPARTMENT OF SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, AND THE ENVIRONMENT </p><p>(DOSTE - WHICH REGULATES PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS) AGREED. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HO CHI  00538  01 OF 03  211143Z </p><p>ALL SAID THEY WERE DOING THEIR BEST TO STOP INFRINGEMENTS, </p><p>BUT THE PROCESS WAS COMPLICATED BY THE LARGE NUMBER OF </p><p>DIFFERENT AGENCIES CHARGED WITH IMPLEMENTING AND ENFORCING </p><p>IPR LAWS.  THEY ALSO OPERATE WITH INADEQUATE RESOURCES AND </p><p>UNDER CONSTRAINTS TO THEIR LEGAL AUTHORITY.  FINES ARE </p><p>NOMINAL AND LIMITS ON THEIR AUTHORITY MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO </p><p>CATCH OFFENDERS AND ENFORCE THE LAW, THEY CLAIMED. </p><p> </p><p>IPR IS IMPORTANT - IN THEORY </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>3.  AT DOSTE, THE CHIEF OF THE INDUSTRIAL PROPERTY </p><p>MANAGEMENT SECTION, MS. TRUONG THUY TRANG, EXPLAINED THAT </p><p>FIVE AGENCIES WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR IPR ENFORCEMENT.  HER </p><p>OFFICE HANDLES THE REGULATION OF TRADEMARK AND PATENTS.  A </p><p>SEPARATE DOSTE INSPECTORATE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ACCURATE </p><p>PRODUCT LABELING.  SHE ALSO CITED THE MARKET MANAGEMENT </p><p>BOARD, THE ECONOMIC POLICE, CUSTOMS, AND THE CIVIL COURTS. </p><p>SHE LEFT OUT THE DEPARTMENT OF CULTURE AND INFORMATION, </p><p>WHICH REVIEWS AND CENSORS "SENSITIVE" MATERIAL, BUT IS ALSO </p><p>RESPONSIBLE FOR COPYRIGHT PROTECTION. </p><p> </p><p>4.  MS. TRANG ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS </p><p>WERE MORE THEORY THAN REALITY, BUT CLAIMED HCMC HAD THE BEST </p><p>IPR ENFORCEMENT IN THE COUNTRY.  ALTHOUGH HER AGENCY HAD NO </p><p>DIRECT ENFORCEMENT ROLE, IT OFTEN TRIED TO MEDIATE BETWEEN </p><p>RIGHTS-HOLDERS AND INFRINGERS.  DOSTE COULD ALSO ADVISE </p><p>ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES OF IPR VIOLATIONS, SHE SAID, BUT COULD </p><p>NOT COMPEL THEM TO ACT.  SHE STATED THAT WHILE THE MARKET </p><p>MANAGEMENT BOARD "HAD ALL OF THE POWER," THEY WERE OFTEN </p><p>LESS EFFECTIVE THAN DOSTE\'S MEDIATION EFFORTS.  SHE OFFERED </p><p>TO LOOK INTO ANY SPECIFIC CASES OF CONCERN. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HO CHI  00538  01 OF 03  211143Z </p><p> </p><p>5.  THE DELEGATION TOOK THE BAIT AND ASKED ABOUT THE CASE OF </p><p>HCMC\'S "HARD ROCK CAF," RUN BY SOMEONE WHO DID NOT HAVE THE </p><p>RIGHT TO THE TRADEMARK.  THE US RIGHTS-HOLDER HAD FILED A </p><p>COMPLAINT LAST YEAR TO TRY TO SHUT THE PLACE DOWN.  MS. </p><p>TRANG STATED THAT SHE WAS AWARE OF THE CASE AND HAD MET WITH </p><p>THE OWNER IN A MEDIATION EFFORT.  HE HAD PROMISED IN WRITING </p><p>TO REMOVE THE OUTDOOR SIGNATURE "HARD ROCK CAF" SIGN FROM </p><p>HIS ESTABLISHMENT.  WHEN THE DELEGATION REMARKED IT WOULD BE </p><p>VISITING THE SITE LATER THAT AFTERNOON, SHE BACKTRACKED AND </p><p>STATED THAT THE LAW FIRM REPRESENTING THE RIGHTS-HOLDER HAD </p><p>NOT ADVISED HER AS TO WHETHER THE SIGN HAD ACTUALLY BEEN </p><p>REMOVED.  SHE ALSO NOTED THAT DOSTE DID NOT HAVE AUTHORITY </p><p>TO ENTER THE RESTAURANT TO SEE IF THE TRADEMARK WAS BEING </p><p>USED IMPROPERLY INSIDE. </p><p> </p><p>6.  AT THE MARKET MANAGEMENT BOARD, WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR </p><p>ENFORCING ALL LAWS RELATING TO DOMESTIC TRADE IN THE CITY, </p><p>DIRECTOR HUYNH TAN PHONG POINTED OUT THAT HIS OFFICE HAD </p><p>WORKED WELL WITH A NUMBER OF FOREIGN COMPANIES WHO HAD IPR </p><p>PROBLEMS, NAMING PHILIPS, PROCTER & GAMBLE, AND RICOH.  (THE </p><p>ATTORNEY WHO HAD REPRESENTED RICOH - WHICH WAS TRYING TO </p><p>STOP THE SALE OF COUNTERFEIT TONER CARTRIDGES - HAD EARLIER </p><p>TOLD THE DELEGATION THAT THE MMB WERE SO UNDER-RESOURCED </p><p>THAT THE DIRECTOR HIMSELF VISITED A SHOP PRETENDING TO BE A </p><p>BUYER, IN ORDER TO ID THE COUNTERFEITS.)  MR. PHONG </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGED THAT HCMC AND THE COUNTRY STILL FACED HUGE IPR </p><p>PROBLEMS, BUT PLEDGED TO ASSIST WITH ANY IPR-RELATED </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HO CHI  00538  02 OF 03  211143Z </p><p>REQUEST.  WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE "HARD ROCK CAF" CASE, HE </p><p>SAID THE FILE WAS STILL WITH DOSTE, SO HIS AGENCY DID NOT </p><p>YET HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO TAKE ACTION. </p><p> </p><p>7.  OFFICIALS AT THE LOCAL DEPARTMENT OF TRADE ALSO </p><p>REITERATED THE IMPORTANCE OF IPR ISSUES FOR HO CHI MINH </p><p>CITY.  DIRECTOR PHAM THI KIM HONG NOTED THAT ONE OF THE </p><p>CITY\'S MAJOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT GOALS WAS TO ESTABLISH A </p><p>LOCAL INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY.  THIS COULD ONLY </p><p>HAPPEN IF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS WERE TRULY PROTECTED. </p><p>AT THE SAME TIME, HOWEVER, SHE DISAVOWED ANY ENFORCEMENT </p><p>ROLE FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF TRADE.  WHEN THE DELEGATION </p><p>POINTED OUT THAT THE MARKET MANAGEMENT BOARD FELL UNDER HER </p><p>DEPARTMENT\'S JURISDICTION, SHE STATED IT WAS ONLY NOMINALLY </p><p>SO, AND THAT THE MMB OPERATED AUTONOMOUSLY.  DEPUTY DIRECTOR </p><p>NGUYEN DINH MAI, WHO ALSO ATTENDED THE MEETING, STATED </p><p>INFORMALLY TO ONE DELEGATION MEMBER THAT IPR CONCERNS NEEDED </p><p>TO BE RAISED WITH THE HCMC PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE IN ORDER TO </p><p>MAKE PROGRESS. </p><p> </p><p>IPR VIOLATIONS HURT LOCAL BUSINESS </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>8.  LOCAL VIETNAMESE BUSINESSPEOPLE WHO MET THE DELEGATION </p><p>STRESSED THAT IPR INFRINGERS HAD AFFECTED THEIR BUSINESSES. </p><p>MR. LE HONG THANH, DIRECTOR OF SAIGON AUDIO, A LOCAL </p><p>RECORDING COMPANY, STATED THAT BECAUSE ALL OF HIS PRODUCTS </p><p>WERE COPIED, IT WAS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO GENERATE PROFITS </p><p>ON NEW MUSIC.  IT WAS DIFFICULT TO SELL LEGITIMATE COPIES </p><p>AND RECOUP COSTS, LET ALONE GENERATE PROFITS IN A MARKET </p><p>WHERE PIRATED COPIES OUTNUMBERED LEGITIMATES BY ABOUT 20/30 </p><p>TO ONE.  TO GENERATE REVENUE, SAIGON AUDIO HAD TAKEN TO RE- </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HO CHI  00538  02 OF 03  211143Z </p><p>RELEASING "OLDIES," WHICH COULD BE SOLD MORE CHEAPLY.  THEY </p><p>ALSO REDUCED THE NUMBER OF NEW RECORDINGS BY VIETNAMESE </p><p>ARTISTS FROM 100 TO 40 PER YEAR.  HIS COMPANY, ALONG WITH </p><p>OTHERS IN THE LOCAL AUDIO AND VIDEO INDUSTRY, HAD SUBMITTED </p><p>A PETITION TO THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT ASKING FOR MORE </p><p>COPYRIGHT PROTECTION.  HE BELIEVES SOME PIRATED PRODUCTION </p><p>IS OCCURRING IN VIETNAM, PARTICULARLY FOR LOCAL FILMS AND </p><p>TAPES.  THIS IS IN CONTRAST TO PIRATED COPIES OF AMERICAN </p><p>AND OTHER FOREIGN FILMS/RECORDINGS, MOST OF WHICH ARE </p><p>BELIEVED TO COME FROM CHINA. </p><p> </p><p>9.  MR. NGUYEN VINH LOC, THE LOCAL DISTRIBUTOR OF BOSE </p><p>SPEAKERS, ALSO COMPLAINED THAT HIS COMPANIES HAVE TO COMPETE </p><p>WITH FAKES.  HE SAID SHODDY COPIES ARE IMPORTED FROM CHINA </p><p>AND BETTER QUALITY COUNTERFEITS COME OUT OF TAIWAN.  FALSE </p><p>BOSE LABELS ARE ATTACHED ONCE THE PRODUCT ENTERS THE </p><p>COUNTRY.   MR. LOC STATED THAT A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO, BOSE </p><p>HAD TRIED WORK WITH LOCAL ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND AN </p><p>ATTORNEY TO STOP THE SALE OF THE FAKES.  HE CLAIMED THIS WAS </p><p>COMPLETELY INEFFECTUAL.  HE SUGGESTED THAT FOR IPR </p><p>ENFORCEMENT TO WORK THERE MUST BE POLITICAL WILL AT A </p><p>RELATIVELY HIGH LEVEL.  HE FELT "THE VIETNAMESE WAY" WOULD </p><p>BE TO GO THROUGH THE PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE AND URGE THEM TO </p><p>SEND THE ORDER DOWN TO THE ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES.  ONLY </p><p>WORKING WITH THE AGENCIES DID NOT BRING RESULTS. </p><p> </p><p>CDS, DVDS, AND EXPENSIVE T-SHIRTS </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>10.  AT THE END OF THE DAY, THE DELEGATION VISITED A </p><p>DOWNTOWN STREET LINED WITH SMALL SHOPS SELLING CDS AND DVDS, </p><p>NONE OF WHICH APPEARED TO BE LICENSED COPIES.  DVDS SELL FOR </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HO CHI  00538  02 OF 03  211143Z </p><p>ABOUT 20,000 VND (ABOUTUSD1.20).  MOSTLY LOCAL PRODUCT WAS </p><p>DISPLAYED IN THE SHOPS, BUT FOREIGN FILMS AND AUDIO </p><p>RECORDINGS WERE ALSO AVAILABLE.  THE GROUP ALSO STROLLED </p><p>OVER TO THE "HARD ROCK CAF" A FEW BLOCKS AWAY, WHERE THE </p><p>SIGN WAS STILL OVER THE FRONT ENTRANCE.  INSIDE, THE WALLS </p><p>AND CEILING DRIPPED WITH ROCK N\' ROLL EPHEMERA AND, </p><p>STRANGELY, AUTO AND MOTORCYCLE PARTS.  THE INTERIOR MIGHT </p><p>NOT BE CONFUSED WITH ITS LICENSED COUNTERPARTS ELSEWHERE IN </p><p>THE WORLD, BUT THIS PLACE DID HAVE A BOOTH BY THE DOOR </p><p>SELLING EXPENSIVE "HARD ROCK CAF SAIGON" T-SHIRTS AND </p><p>TRINKETS.  EVEN WITH ALL OF THE EFFORTS BY A LOCAL LAW FIRM </p><p>AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES, IT APPEARS THIS PLACE IS DOING </p><p>BUSINESS AS USUAL. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p>11.  ALL OF THE LOCAL OFFICIALS WHO MET THE DELEGATION SPOKE </p><p>STRONGLY ABOUT THE NEED TO ATTACK VIETNAM\'S IPR PROBLEMS AND </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGED THAT WEAK IPR ENFORCEMENT WOULD ACT AS A BRAKE </p><p>ON HCMC\'S ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT.  THIS OFFERS SOME HOPE THAT, </p><p>EVEN IN THIS DIFFICULT ENVIRONMENT, LOCAL OFFICIALS AND </p><p>BUSINESS REALIZE THERE ARE CLEAR BENEFITS TO IPR PROTECTION. </p><p>AT THE SAME TIME, IN THE SAMPLE CASE WE RAISED AT EVERY </p><p>MEETING - THAT OF THE "HARD ROCK CAF" - OFFICIALS SEEMED </p><p>READY TO PASS THE BUCK - TO OTHER AGENCIES OR EVEN TO THE </p><p>LAW FIRM REPRESENTING THE RIGHTS-HOLDER.  AND WHILE </p><p>SPIDERMAN IS UNLIKELY TO DESCEND AND ROUND UP ALL OF THE </p><p>SPECIAL INTERESTS PROFITING ON THE PIRATED GOODS AVAILABLE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HO CHI  00538  03 OF 03  211143Z </p><p>IN THE LOCAL MARKET, GOOD QUALITY COPIES OF SPIDERMAN ARE </p><p>ALREADY AVAILABLE HERE ON DVD. </p><p> </p><p>12.  THE DELEGATION DID NOT HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO CLEAR </p><p>THIS CABLE. </p><p> </p><p>YAMAUCHI </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
