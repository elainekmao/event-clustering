<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ABU DHABI 000725 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARP, NEA/PPD, NEA/RA, INR </p><p>SECDEF FOR OASD/PA </p><p>USCINCCENT FOR POLAD </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH; PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: OIIP, KMDR, TC </p><p>SUBJECT:  MEDIA REACTION:  MORE ON POWELL\'S UNSC SPEECH AND MEPI </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  SUMMARY:  LOCAL NEWSPAPERS CONTINUED TO REPORT EXTENSIVELY ON </p><p>SECRETARY POWELL\'S SPEECH AT THE UNSC.  EDITORIALS IN THE ARABIC </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>DAILIES NOTE THAT THE U.S. IS PLANNING TO ATTACK IRAQ IN ORDER TO </p><p>CONTROL ARAB AND IRAQI RESOURCES, MAINLY OIL.  THE EDITORIALS </p><p>ALSO CLAIM THAT THE ATTACK WOULD RESULT IN RESHAPING THE ENTIRE </p><p>REGION ACCORDING TO AMERICAN AND ISRAELI INTERESTS.  MEANWHILE, </p><p>AN AL BAYAN EDITORIAL CALLED ON ARABS TO WAKE UP BEFORE IT IS TOO </p><p>LATE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  COMMENT:  FOLLOWING THE SECRETARY\'S PRESENTATION AT THE UN, </p><p>AL-ITTIHAD, THE SEMI-OFFICIAL ARABIC DAILY MOST LIKELY TO MIRROR </p><p>OFFICIAL THINKING, HAS BEEN MARKEDLY LESS NEGATIVE REGARDING USG </p><p>POLICIES TOWARDS IRAQ THAN THE OTHER, MORE DOGMATIC LOCAL ARABIC </p><p>DAILIES.  AL-ITTIHAD IS RUNNING COMMENTARIES AND COVERAGE </p><p>CRITICAL OF THE IRAQI REGIME, MANY OF WHICH LARGELY BLAME THE </p><p>CURRENT CRISIS ON SADDAM HUSSEIN AND NOT THE US ADMINISTRATION. </p><p>END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>3.  UNDER THE HEADLINE, "RESHAPING THE REGION," ABU DHABI-BASED </p><p>PAN-ARAB DAILY "AKHBAR AL-ARAB" 2/8 EDITORIALIZED: </p><p> </p><p>"WITH A RUDE FRANKNESS AND CLEAR WORDS, SECRETARY OF STATE COLIN </p><p>POWELL DEFINED THE REAL GOALS FOR HIS NATION\'S IMPULSE TO ATTACK </p><p>IRAQ, THE REARRANGEMENT OF THE MIDDLE EAST IN ACCORDANCE TO U.S. </p><p>INTERESTS.  THE OBJECTIVES OF INVADING AND OCCUPYING IRAQ ARE NOT </p><p>VIRTUAL ASSUMPTIONS ANYMORE.  SECRETARY POWELL HAS DISCARDED THE </p><p>FAADE OF A DOVE AND JOINED THE HAWKS HAS PLACED THE IMMINENT WAR </p><p>ON TRACK.  WE HOPE THAT POWELL\'S FRANKNESS WOULD PERSUADE THE </p><p>DOUBTFUL AND DECEIVED WITH GOOD AMERICAN INTENTIONS.  THE GOAL OF </p><p>THE WAR GOES BEYOND IRAQ AND IS ONLY THE BEGINNING OF A LAUNCHING </p><p>PAD TO RESHAPE THE REGION, ITS BORDERS, AND ITS REGIMES, IN </p><p>ACCORDANCE WITH AMERICAN INTERESTS WITH CONSIDERATION FOR ISRAELI </p><p>ASPIRATIONS AND AMBITIONS TO DOMINATE THE REGION AND CONTROL ITS </p><p>RESOURCES..." </p><p> </p><p>4.  THE EDITOR-IN-CHIEF OF THE DUBAI-BASED BUSINESS-ORIENTED "AL- </p><p>BAYAN" ON 2/8 WROTE IN A FRONT-PAGE EDITORIAL: </p><p> </p><p>"... IRAQ MUST KNOW THAT IT IS USING ITS SPARE TIME.  THE RESULT </p><p>IS BEING DECIDED.  POWELL\'S SPEECH BEFORE THE UNSC WAS A WAR </p><p>MESSAGE AND MUST BE UNDERSTOOD BY IRAQ AS SUCH ... THE COUNTDOWN </p><p>FOR THE WAR IS AWAITING THE COMPLETED ARRIVAL OF AMERICAN TROOPS </p><p>AFTER TWO WEEKS ... THE WAR THIS TIME WILL TAKE PLACE ON IRAQI </p><p>SOIL AND IS UNDOUBTEDLY DIFFERENT FROM PREVIOUS IRAQI WARS, THE </p><p>GULF WAR, AND THE WAR WITH IRAN, WHERE MOST OF THE BATTLES </p><p>OCCURRED OUTSIDE IRAQ.  IT MEANS DESTROYING EVERYTHING ON THE </p><p>GROUND, AND IRAQ WILL NOT BE ABLE TO STAND IN THE FACE OF AN </p><p>AMERICAN ARSENAL EQUIPPED WITH THE MOST SOPHISTICATED AND MODERN </p><p>MACHINES ... THE U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE SAYS THAT THE WAR ON </p><p>IRAQ WOULD CAUSE SOME TROUBLE BUT THAT ALL TROUBLES WOULD BE </p><p>EASED WITH OIL.  THE SUCCESS IN IRAQ WILL INCREASE AMERICA\'S </p><p>APPETITE TO SWALLOW THE REST OF THE CAKE.  AMERICA\'S AMBITIONS </p><p>AND AGENDA ARE NOT SECRET ANYMORE.  THEY STATE IT PUBLICLY IN ALL </p><p>MEDIA.  THEIR SUCCESS IN IRAQ AND THE FALL OF BAGHDAD WILL LEAD </p><p>INTO RESHAPING THE REGION FUNDAMENTALLY AND POSITIVELY." </p><p> </p><p>5.  SHARJAH-BASED PAN-ARAB DAILY "AL-KHALEEJ" EDITORIALIZED ON </p><p>2/8: </p><p> </p><p>"IS THERE A COMMON FACTOR THAT LINKS THE PARTNERSHIP INITIATIVE </p><p>FOR DEMOCRACY PROPOSED BY WASHINGTON FOR THE SO-CALLED REFORM OF </p><p>THE ARAB WORLD AND THE AGGRESSION WASHINGTON AND LONDON ARE </p><p>PLANNING TO WAGE AGAINST IRAQ?  THE GOAL IS ONE: RESHAPING THE </p><p>ARAB REGION FUNDAMENTALLY ACCORDING TO U.S. INTERESTS INCLUDING </p><p>THOSE OF ISRAEL ... AMERICA WILL TURN IRAQ IN PARTICULAR AND THE </p><p>ARAB NATIONS IN GENERAL INTO EARTHENWARE WHERE THE POTTER CAN </p><p>DECIDE THEIR FORM, SHAPE, SIZE AND WEIGHT.  THE ISSUE IS NOT OF </p><p>ALLEGED WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION WHICH AMERICA, BRITAIN, AND </p><p>ISRAEL WANT TO ELIMINATE BUT TO TAKE CONTROL OF ARAB DESTINY AND </p><p>REDRAW IT TO SUIT THEIR NEW COLONIAL GREED..." </p><p> </p><p>6.  TAKING A TOUGH LINE AGAINST THE US, AN "AL BAYAN" EDITORIAL </p><p>COMMENTED ON 2/9: </p><p> </p><p>"ARAB REACTION TO POWELL\'S PRESENTATION ADDED FRESH EVIDENCE OF </p><p>THE ARAB REGIME\'S WEAKNESS IN FRONT OF THE US OFFENCE TO </p><p>DISMEMBER AND REMAKE THE MIDDLE EAST ... WE HEARD NO BOLD ARAB </p><p>REACTION TO POWELL\'S THREATS TO ATTACK IRAQ AND HIS FABRICATED </p><p>EVIDENCE ON BAGHDAD\'S ALLEGED WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION.  IT IS </p><p>REGRETTABLE THAT THERE WAS NO ARAB REACTION TO EXPOSE POWELL\'S </p><p>DRAMA TO INVADE IRAQ.  UNFORTUNATELY, REACTIONS FROM WESTERN </p><p>CAPITOLS (MOSCOW, PARIS, AND BERLIN), ALTHOUGH NOT IN DEFENCE OF </p><p>IRAQ OR ARABS, WERE STRONGER AND MORE DECISIVE THAN THOSE OF ARAB </p><p>CAPITALS BECAUSE THEIR INTERESTS ARE VULNERABLE TO THE \'COWBOY\' </p><p>INVASION (PLANNED) BY THE U.S. ... WHILE THESE COUNTRIES ARE </p><p>TRYING TO HAMPER THE US WAR WAGON TO PROTECT THEIR OWN INTERESTS </p><p>IN THE REGION, THE ARABS ARE INVOLVED IN SELLING THE US PROPOSAL </p><p>TO IRAQI PRESIDENT SADDAM HUSSEIN TO EXILE TO AVERT WAR." </p><p> </p><p>WILLIAMS </p><p></p></div>
