<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 001214 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, P, EUR AND EB </p><p>TREASURY FOR U/S TAYLOR </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY\'S ECONOMY:  PRIVATIZATION UPDATE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. (A) ANKARA 1131 </p><p>     B. (B) 02 ANKARA 3538 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but Unclassified.  Not for Internet Distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary:  The GOT\'s ambitious $4 billion </p><p>privatization plan for 2003 is moving forward, with some </p><p>positive and negative developments.  On the positive side, </p><p>three large state companies (TEKEL, PETKIM, TUPRAS) are </p><p>slated for sale in the first half of 2003:  PETKIM\'s tender </p><p>is already out and the other two are being prepared.  On the </p><p>negative side, fears of resulting job losses, which have </p><p>delayed privatization efforts for the past decade, have </p><p>resurfaced in the form of a proposed job privatization bill </p><p>that would guarantee 70,000 new civil service jobs for </p><p>laid-off employees of privatized firms.  Another step </p><p>backward is the planned merger by the GOT of two steel </p><p>producers - one already privatized but bankrupt (Kardemir) </p><p>and the other a profitable company in the process of being </p><p>fully privatized (Erdemir). End Summary </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Privatization Administration Vice President Haluk </p><p>Buyukbas recently updated us on GOT\'s ambitious 2003 </p><p>privatization program.  There are currently 34 companies </p><p>(employing more than 62,000 unionized workers and 10,000 </p><p>civil servants) under the portfolio run by the GOT,s </p><p>Privatization Administration (PA) ) 19 of those companies </p><p>are fully owned by the PA.  Fourteen companies are scheduled </p><p>to go on the auction block this year, in 38 separate sales. </p><p>The highlighters for sale in the first half of 2003 are the </p><p>tobacco and alcohol giant TEKEL, the petrochemical company </p><p>PETKIM, and Turkish Refineries (TUPRAS). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>TEKEL </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Tenders for the alcohol and tobacco giant TEKEL will </p><p>be advertised in June with final sale expected by the end of </p><p>the year.  Sales of the spirits distilleries and cigarette </p><p>factories are expected to be made in two large block sales </p><p>and are expected to represent a large portion of the $4 </p><p>billion 2003 privatization target.  U.S. businesses have </p><p>complained of draconian import laws Parliament enacted last </p><p>year aimed at protecting TEKEL from competition during the </p><p>sales process, so as to ensure high market valuation (see </p><p>septel). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PETKIM </p><p>------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) The PA has announced a tender for PETKIM on Jan 20, </p><p>2003 and specified April 2, 2003 as the deadline for </p><p>submission of bids.  Only 4% of PETKIM shares are currently </p><p>being traded at the Istanbul Stock Exchange (ISEM); the </p><p>Pension Fund owns 4% of the shares and PA,s shares amount to </p><p>89%.  The PA is targeting block sale of a minimum 51% of </p><p>shares this year, which would switch control of the company </p><p>to the private sector.  The investors will have the </p><p>flexibility to bid for up to 89% of the company shares in the </p><p>tender. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Although PETKIM is the sole petrochemical producer </p><p>in the Turkish market, it only has a 35% market share; the </p><p>rest are imports.  There are currently no trade restrictions </p><p>or customs barriers for petrochemical imports.  PA has not </p><p>conducted a valuation for PETKIM so far.  Buyukbas thinks </p><p>what potential buyers are willing to pay would become the </p><p>value of the company, rather than the PA setting the price. </p><p>The PA expects several international and Turkish consortiums </p><p>to bid for PETKIM. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>TUPRAS </p><p>------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) A total of 34.5% of TUPRAS shares are currently </p><p>traded at the Istanbul Stock Exchange.  The PA is planning to </p><p>announce a minimum 17% block sale of TUPRAS in the second </p><p>quarter of 2003, in order to reduce state control of the </p><p>company to under 50%.  TUPRAS currently has an 86% share in </p><p>the total crude oil processing in Turkey.  Atas (owned by BP) </p><p>refinery processes the remaining amount, but the PA expects </p><p>this refinery to cease production by 2005, since it does not </p><p>satisfy EU environmental conditions due to a lack of </p><p>investment.  Buyukbas said Russian energy companies Yukos and </p><p>Lukoil have expressed great interest in TUPRAS privatization. </p><p> Given their financial strength, they are likely to be the </p><p>most competitive bidders.  Buyukbas said the PA appointed </p><p>Salomon Smith Barney as the consultant for TUPRAS </p><p>privatization, and the company is expected to prepare a </p><p>strategy for TUPRAS privatization by May 2003. </p><p>7. (SBU) Other large enterprises on the auction block for the </p><p>second quarter are Sumer Holding A.S. (textiles and leather), </p><p>Tugsas (fertilizers and ammonium nitrate), and Tumosan Turk </p><p>Motor (machinery).  The highlighted tender for the second </p><p>half of 2003 is Turkish Airlines, which is scheduled to be </p><p>advertised in September under a block sale and a public </p><p>offering. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Two Recent Steps Backward </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) Deputy PM Sener announced February 20 that the GOT </p><p>had agreed to submit to parliament a &privatization job </p><p>law8 that would guarantee 70,000 new civil service positions </p><p>for laid-off workers (see ref A). Besides defeating any gains </p><p>in efficiency resulting from privatization, this policy is </p><p>counterproductive, especially considering other programs are </p><p>already in place to mitigate the losses of laid-off workers. </p><p>A joint World Bank-GOT &Privatization Social Support </p><p>Project,8 initiated in 1999, provides $250 million in </p><p>severance packages to displaced workers (70% funded by WB; </p><p>30% by GOT).  World Bank expert Ismail Arslan told us the </p><p>severance packages would provide workers up to $30,000, and </p><p>that they were very generous when compared to similar </p><p>programs in other countries.  He added that less than $20 </p><p>million of the $250 million pot has been spent thus far, </p><p>because the GOT is not privatizing. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) On February 22, Deputy PM Sahin announced a plan to </p><p>merge the antiquated, bankrupt, and inefficient Kardemir </p><p>(steel company - see ref B) with Erdemir (iron and steel), </p><p>Turkey\'s largest steel producer which is already half </p><p>privatized and is planned to be fully privatized by the </p><p>Privatization Administration.  Kardemir, which is owned by </p><p>its labor union, received a $250 million bailout in 1995 and </p><p>had its debts paid by the GOT.  By 2001, the company was </p><p>again about to go bankrupt before being saved by a government </p><p>bailout, in the form of restructured debts and loans. </p><p>Erdemir management, meanwhile, plans to increase its annual </p><p>steel production and reduce its workforce, making it more </p><p>competitive with the private sector.  Erdemir Board Chairman </p><p>Recai Berber told the press on Feb. 21 that Erdemir would </p><p>"stumble" if Kardemir was merged with it. (Comment:  Merger </p><p>of the bankrupt but privatized Kardemir and the </p><p>half-privatized Erdemir will reduce Erdemir\'s remaining </p><p>privatization potential.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Privatizations Further Down the Road </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) As for new entrants into the PA portfolio, Buyukbas </p><p>said the PA had high expectations for the privatization of </p><p>toll ways, the National Lottery, and Istanbul Stock Exchange. </p><p> The GOT needs to amend certain laws to start the </p><p>privatization process for these entities.  Buyukbas said </p><p>among these entities, the National Lottery Administration </p><p>would bring the highest revenue to the GOT, noting by way of </p><p>comparison that privatization of only 17% of the Greek </p><p>National Lottery brought Euro 500 million. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
