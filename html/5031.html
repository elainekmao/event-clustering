<p>UNCLAS GUATEMALA 000064 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, AMGT, APER, GT </p><p>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR HAMILTON PRESENTS CREDENTIALS </p><p> </p><p>1. Ambassador John R. Hamilton presented credentials to </p><p>President Alfonso Portillo in a ceremony at the National </p><p>Palace on the morning of January 8, 2003. </p><p> </p><p>2. Following his presentation of Credentials, Ambassador </p><p>Hamilton made the following statement to the press: </p><p> </p><p>In the course of the ceremony in which I presented my </p><p>credentials, I expressed to President Portillo my </p><p>determination to take every opportunity to support Guatemala </p><p>in the construction of a more democratic, more peaceful, and </p><p>more prosperous future for the Guatemalan people. </p><p> </p><p>Our countries have a long history of close cooperation in </p><p>promoting our mutual interests and in meeting the challenges </p><p>we share. I declared to President Portillo my desire to see </p><p>that the ties of cooperation that link our countries not only </p><p>continue, but become stronger and deeper. </p><p> </p><p>Today is an apt time to reflect upon the relationship between </p><p>the United States and Guatemala, because negotiations begin </p><p>today for a free trade agreement between the United States and </p><p>Central America. This agreement offers a new opportunity for </p><p>our peoples. Free trade brings greatest benefits to countries </p><p>that have an environment of transparency and respect for the </p><p>rule of law. I sincerely hope the Government of Guatemala will </p><p>undertake more concrete actions to respond to these challenges </p><p>in the coming months. </p><p> </p><p>HAMILTON </p><p></p></div>
