<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L OTTAWA 001164 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/22/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PREF, CA, MEPP, Iraq </p><p>SUBJECT: MEPP: CANADIAN VIEWS ON POST-IRAQ DYNAMIC, </p><p>CONFERENCE ON PALESTINIAN REFUGEES </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Minister Counselor Brian Flora, </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: Michael Molloy, Canada\'s Special Coordinator </p><p>for the Middle East Peace Process, believes the U.S. victory </p><p>in Iraq will have the biggest impact on the region of any </p><p>event since the 1967 War.  How the U.S. handles the </p><p>post-conflict phase, he told us, will set the tone for the </p><p>West\'s relationship with the Islamic world.  Molloy said that </p><p>most Palestinians are fed up with the intifadah, and that </p><p>Arab states are increasingly willing to compromise on </p><p>refugees in exchange for a Palestinian state.  Israel sees </p><p>the war in Iraq as a reaffirmation of its muscular approach, </p><p>Molloy argued, and the U.S. will have to force Israeli </p><p>concessions on settlements in order to have a breakthrough in </p><p>the MEPP.  Molloy encouraged the USG to send observers to a </p><p>conference Canada is hosting June 17-20 on Palestinian </p><p>refugees (see para 6).  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) We met with Molloy and his staff on April 16 to </p><p>discuss the impact of the war in Iraq on the Middle East </p><p>peace process.  Molloy believes we are at a crossroads in the </p><p>region, with the potential for catastrophe or exceptional </p><p>progress.  He feels the parameters of an Israeli-Palestinian </p><p>agreement are pretty clear - a return to 1967 borders with </p><p>adjustments/offsets, a divided Jerusalem, security provisions </p><p>for Israel, and settlement of refugees. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Molloy said that more and more Israelis see the West </p><p>Bank as a liability.  He feels that 13 settlements, with </p><p>11-12,000 Israelis, are key.  If the U.S. was willing to take </p><p>a tough approach with Israel on settlements, Molloy </p><p>contended, it would pay huge dividends in the Arab world. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Molloy believes the refugee issue can be resolved with </p><p>very little return to Israel proper, and that Palestine needs </p><p>to be made the destination of choice.  Large-scale </p><p>international funding will be needed, he continued, but money </p><p>alone is not enough.  The dignity of the refugees is also </p><p>important.  Molloy\'s Senior Advisor Jonathan Laine, who </p><p>returned in 2002 from a posting in Ramallah, contended that </p><p>the intifada had killed any chance of refugee return to </p><p>Israel. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Molloy said there were indications that Syria and </p><p>other Arab countries would be flexible on refugee </p><p>resettlement in exchange for an agreement on a Palestinian </p><p>state.  He said this subject was no longer taboo, as shown by </p><p>the planned participation of Arab scholars at a July 11-13 </p><p>refugee conference at the Max Planck Institute in Heidelberg. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) Laine noted that the International Development </p><p>Research Centre (IDRC) of Canada will be hosting a conference </p><p>on Palestinian refugees June 17-20 in Ottawa.  This will be a </p><p>stocktaking conference, where international experts will </p><p>discuss existing research on the refugee issue and identify </p><p>gaps where further study is needed.  Confirmed U.S. </p><p>participants include Michael Fischbach, Robert Malley, Martin </p><p>Indyk, Geoffrey Aronson, and Susan Akram.  The Canadian </p><p>Government, which chairs the Refugee Working Group, has </p><p>invited the USG (and other key countries/organizations) to </p><p>send two observers to the conference. </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) Molloy also mentioned that Canada had been asked to </p><p>join a task force on Palestinian reform, and that he would </p><p>want to discuss with State NEA how Canada could be most </p><p>helpful. </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
