<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 004161 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/27/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY: CORRUPTION CHARGES DIMMING GENC PARTY\'S </p><p>LUSTER </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ANKARA 3784 </p><p>     B. ANKARA 4026 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Acting Political Counselor Nicholas S. Kass. </p><p>Reason: 1.5 (b)(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: New corruption charges against Motorola </p><p>deadbeat Cem Uzan, stemming from his abuse of Uzan-linked </p><p>companies against Turkish citizens in Turkey, are having a </p><p>negative impact on his populist, xenophobic Genc Party\'s </p><p>standing in the public eye.  The controversy surrounding </p><p>the notoriously shady Uzan clan is undercutting Genc\'s efforts </p><p>to craft a more moderate (i.e, less anti-U.S.) facade, and to </p><p>cultivate ties to the Turkish State/military seen as </p><p>essential for Genc\'s emergence as a champion of the Establishment </p><p>against the ruling AK Party.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>Hitting, and Hurting, At Home </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Cem Uzan has long been a controversial figure, stemming </p><p>from a string of criminal racketeering and other charges </p><p>against the Uzan business empire.  Over the past year, most of </p><p>the headlines focused on Uzan\'s defrauding of U.S. and other </p><p>companies, which in a bizarre way had added to Genc\'s budding </p><p>popularity and mystique among angrier elements of the Turkish </p><p>electorate. In the words of a popular saying on the streets in </p><p>Ankara and other urban locales, "if Uzan is smart enough to </p><p>cheat the Americans he\'s smart enough to run the country." </p><p>That sentiment seemed to hold sway when the mugs and suckers </p><p>were the "foreigners" that, reflected in the xenophobic </p><p>logorrhea of the Genc leader\'s stump speech, are intent on </p><p>keeping Turkey perpetually in thrall. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Lately, however, the Uzans have been accused of </p><p>fleecing Turkish citizens, whom Genc claims it is </p><p>trying to protect.  As reported in reftels, the  GOT </p><p>seized Cukurova and Kepez electricity companies -- both </p><p>owned by the Uzans -- for serious accounting malfeasance. </p><p>Uzan subsequently lashed out against AK and P.M. Erdogan in a </p><p>speech in Bursa, prompting Erdogan to file a defamation suit </p><p>against the Genc leader fueling a story that casts Uzan in the </p><p>role of the heavy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) In recent meetings, many of our contacts have indicated </p><p>to us that the corruption charges are beginning to have their </p><p>effect on Uzan\'s popularity and public support for Genc. </p><p>Huseyin Kocabiyik, former close advisor to former P.M. Tansu </p><p>Ciller (herself the subject of numerous corruption charges) </p><p>and head of an Ankara-based think tank, told poloff June 27 </p><p>that Uzan is making major tactical mistakes in his handling of </p><p>the story.  "Uzan should have behaved as if he were a victim </p><p>of oppression -- as Erdogan has done for so long and so </p><p>successfully," he said.  (Note: playing the victim was also a </p><p>Ciller specialty.  End note).  Citing data compiled by his </p><p>firm, Kocabiyik stated that in the wake of Uzan\'s Bursa speech, </p><p>public support for Genc had dropped from 14% to 12% in a </p><p>matter </p><p>of days. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>Takkiye Makeover Muffed </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) The corruption charges and Uzan\'s public rebuke come as </p><p>Genc is trying to moderate its public image in a bid for </p><p>respectability and the mainstream votes it needs to challenge </p><p>AK.  While the Genc reality remains unedifying, the rhetoric, </p><p>for now, is less overtly hostile to the U.S. (reftels). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Uzan himself has softened his tone, pleading publicly that </p><p>the USG should "trust me."  Speaking to a group of reporters </p><p>on June 18, Uzan noted, "we have been allies with the U.S. </p><p>for 50-60 years; America is an important friend and ally." </p><p>Privately, Genc officials are trying to convey a similar </p><p>message. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- An Ankara provincial official responsible for political </p><p>affairs told poloff June 12 that Genc will do whatever it </p><p>takes to solve Turkey\'s problems.  Repeating a message we have </p><p>heard many times from Genc, the administrator averred, "if </p><p>people want to call us fascist, then we are fascist.  If </p><p>people want to call us communist, then we are communist." When asked </p><p>about Genc\'s rampant anti-American media campaign in the </p><p>run-up to the Nov. 2002 elections and Operation Iraqi Freedom, the </p><p>official  objected, saying "we have never been anti-American </p><p>-- anti-IMF, maybe, but never anti-American." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Genc Party\'s Amasya sub-provincial chairman Ali Dinc </p><p>offered similar sentiments to poloff June 27. Because Genc is against </p><p>the "overly strict conditions" the IMF places on loans, and </p><p>because of U.S. influence in the IMF, "America gets blamed." </p><p>He suggested that the U.S. is "too sensitive" to Genc\'s </p><p>political tactics.  Kemal Aksungur -- from Genc\'s media and </p><p>public relations office -- June 24 candidly explained to </p><p>poloff that the anti-American messages were "just tactics," </p><p>but needed to be modified now that Genc is trying to </p><p>become a serious player. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>Limits to State Connections? </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) As noted in ref A, contacts across the political </p><p>spectrum have told us that Genc is reaching out to the </p><p>military in an attempt to present itself as the only viable </p><p>alternative to AK.  Genc members themselves are trying to </p><p>promote this perception; AK, meanwhile, clearly recognizes </p><p>Genc\'s potential as State-backed challenger.  A non-political </p><p>(civil servant) Prime Ministry Adviser to Erdogan recently </p><p>asserted to us that Maj. General Erdal Senel, head of the TGS </p><p>Legal Department,is close to Uzan.  "Hurriyet" columnist </p><p>Cuneyt Ulsever, among others, has also indicated to us that a </p><p>number of retired senior military, including the disgruntled </p><p>Gen. Doga Aktulga, are associated unofficially with Genc. </p><p>Kocabiyik, the well-known political operator, suggested that </p><p>there are a number of officers -- both retired and active -- </p><p>who are Genc sympathizers. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) There are, however, limits to Genc\'s efforts to </p><p>cultivate and profit from ties to the military.  Ulsever </p><p>speculated that the corruption charges against Uzan have </p><p>made it more difficult for the Establishment to embrace him </p><p>as its defender against AK.  Kocabiyik discounts support to </p><p>Genc from the highest levels: "the man at the top of TGS -- </p><p>I don\'t think I need to say his name -- told me that the </p><p>military will not support Genc."  Several generals -- </p><p>Turgut, Acar, Tasdeler, and Kalyoncu -- have privately </p><p>expressed to us their disdain for Uzan and Genc, believing </p><p>Uzan is out only for himself. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) According to Yahsin Topaloglu, a researcher/activist </p><p>and independent pollster who has worked for AK and several </p><p>centrist parties, Uzan\'s outreach to the generals is </p><p>circumscribed by the ethnic considerations that, lying just </p><p>beneath the surface of State-fostered Turkish nationalism, </p><p>are omnipresent and define patterns of relationships and </p><p>influence in Turkish socio-political life.  Uzan, Topaloglu </p><p>stated, is from Adapazari, and of ethnic Bosnian descent. </p><p>While he has friends among his ethnic brethren, he is </p><p>cordially despised by the "Anatolians, Chechens, </p><p>Circassians," and others in the services. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>One Rival Down, One to Go? </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) According to a number of contacts, the Uzans have </p><p>always profited from their relationships with Turkey\'s </p><p>top guns -- including Presidents Ozal in the 1980s and </p><p>Demirel in the 1990s.  Now, however, Uzan appears to have </p><p>been caught flat-footed by AK -- which is clearly becoming </p><p>adept at some aspects of political hardball as executed in </p><p>Turkey.  While Genc is by no means down for the full ten- </p><p>count, the recent corruption charges have disoriented it, </p><p>siphoning off some of its momentum and, perhaps more </p><p>importantly, tarnishing its image as a party of the people. </p><p>This has left Erdogan and AK, for the moment at least, free </p><p>from serious political threats -- except, perhaps, from </p><p>within AK itself (septel).  Our discussions with several </p><p>senior military officers suggest that, consequently, </p><p>they feel compelled for now to tolerate AK in power, </p><p>precisely because they cannot see Genc as an alternative. </p><p>They would certainly do otherwise if they had any hope </p><p>that Genc could fit the bill. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
