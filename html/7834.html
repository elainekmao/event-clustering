<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 000819 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF/W AND AF/PD </p><p>LAGOS FOR PAS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, KDEM, PREL, NI </p><p>SUBJECT:  NIGERIAN MEDIA AND THE RECENT ELECTIONS </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary.  GON media officials have reacted angrily </p><p>to what they view as instances of negative foreign </p><p>press coverage of Nigeria  recent elections and to </p><p>comments by some international observer missions </p><p>critical of government-owned media  treatment of </p><p>opposition candidates during the campaign period. </p><p>Minister of Information Gana has threatened to expel </p><p>foreign media operating in Nigeria if perceived anti- </p><p>GON reporting continues.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p>EU Monitoring Report, Foreign Journalists Under Fire </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  In its report following the April 19 elections, </p><p>the EU monitoring mission noted a number of problems </p><p>concerning the Nigerian media  treatment and coverage </p><p>of the electoral campaign.  The EU report observed </p><p>that, federal and state-owned media favored ruling </p><p>party candidates and incumbents at the national and </p><p>state levels.  Equal access to the media, while </p><p>officially the policy of the National Broadcasting </p><p>Commission (GON media regulatory and oversight body), </p><p>was not fully practiced by government-owned </p><p>broadcasting organizations.  The EU gave higher marks </p><p>to the private media, who provided more airtime to </p><p>opposition candidates.  However, the EU added that </p><p>funding disparities among the parties also translated </p><p>into unequal airtime and ad space among the </p><p>candidates; moreover, the private media were more </p><p>reluctant to be critical of paying customers.  Despite </p><p>these lapses, the EU concluded that the Nigerian print </p><p>media  overall performance was positive in that </p><p>election coverage was ample and broad, but also noted </p><p>that reporting focused on personalities (vice issues). </p><p>Finally, the EU applauded the Broadcasting </p><p>Organization of Nigeria (BON) for its organization of </p><p>election debates.  (Note:  None of the other observer </p><p>missions included a critique of the Nigerian media in </p><p>their reports.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>GON Refutes EU Charges; Slams Foreign Reporters </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  Following an April 23 press conference, Minister </p><p>of Information Jerry Gana railed against the foreign </p><p>press and the EU report for contributing to a negative </p><p>impression of the recent elections.   Gana </p><p>specifically criticized CNN, BBC, and the VOA for </p><p>their reporting.  He claimed that,  ost of the </p><p>correspondents came with a pre-determined idea of what </p><p>the election should look like.  They came to just find </p><p>faults; they did not come to cover the elections. </p><p>That is why they just closed their eyes and prayed </p><p>that things should happen. Concerning the BBC and </p><p>VOA, Gana stated,  o country would allow the BBC or </p><p>the VOA to do what it does to Nigeria especially on </p><p>the Hausa Service. He added that the GON has made </p><p>known its dissatisfaction to the respective corporate </p><p>offices of the foreign media organizations with whom </p><p>the GON is displeased.  Gana noted that if such </p><p>efforts fail, the GON  ill have no option but expel </p><p>them from our country.  (Note:  The BBC later </p><p>invited Gana to its Abuja studios for an on-air </p><p>interview but the Minister refused to appear.  End </p><p>Note.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  Gana faulted the EU monitoring report for its </p><p>criticism of the government media, claiming that no </p><p>editorial position was biased, manipulated or guided </p><p>by anything but professionalism.  He commended the </p><p>Nigerian media for its performance throughout the </p><p>election period. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  Falling in line with the Minister of Information </p><p>position, Voice of </p><p>Nigeria Director General and </p><p>Chairman of the BON Taiwo Allimi noted that reporting </p><p>by foreign correspondents  as shown that these </p><p>foreign media have taken a stand against the Nigerian </p><p>nation as a peaceful and a united country.  Anywhere </p><p>in the world, it is not the function of any free press </p><p>to deliberately promote an assault on a sovereign </p><p>nation and a people committed to ensuring the </p><p>sustenance of democracy. Like Gana, Allimi singled </p><p>out the BBC, VOA, and CNN for criticism and requested </p><p>that they  eep their politics in the interests of </p><p>their home countries to themselves and be truly </p><p>professional. Allimi was reportedly angered by what </p><p>he considered to be unbalanced reporting bordering on </p><p>inaccuracy and an insufficient understanding of the </p><p>problems, constraints, and challenges before the </p><p>Nigerian nation in carrying out the elections. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  Similarly, the Director General of the NBC, Dr. </p><p>Silas Babajiya Yisa, said the Nigerian media performed </p><p>well during the elections and he congratulated the </p><p>journalists for their professionalism.  He also urged </p><p>the foreign media to resist negative reporting on </p><p>Nigeria. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>The U.S. Mission View on Media and the Elections </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  The Mission believes that the media provided </p><p>adequate electoral coverage overall.  However, as the </p><p>EU stated, government-owned media did show favoritism. </p><p>Although the private media was open to all, airtime </p><p>and page space were disproportionately allotted to </p><p>those who could pay.  This campaign was short on </p><p>substantive debate and the media is partially at </p><p>fault.  By and large, journalists did not attempt to </p><p>veer their political coverage toward issues but </p><p>instead were content to focus their reporting on </p><p>personalities and the political horse-trading that has </p><p>been the traditional fare of Nigerian politics.  Thus, </p><p>the media was competent in covering what was going on </p><p> owever, the media was not very creative in trying </p><p>to push the political debate to higher ground. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  In our own monitoring of Nigerian Television </p><p>Authority (NTA) coverage during the campaign period, </p><p>we have seen regular reporting on PDP candidates and </p><p>only spotty attention paid to the ANPP or others.  Of </p><p>all the government media, the Nigerian national wire </p><p>service agency (NAN) did the most balanced job in </p><p>providing a wide array of reporting covering all </p><p>candidates.  We also have monitored VOA and other </p><p>Hausa language service reporting of the elections, and </p><p>their reporting has been balanced and aired views of </p><p>all sides. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  When government reporters have tried to exercise </p><p>independence to the detriment of the GON, they have </p><p>come under fire from superiors, as happened on April </p><p>12 to an NTA Kaduna reporter.  When he reported during </p><p>a live national news broadcast that the state INEC </p><p>Commissioner was consulting with Abuja before </p><p>releasing the Gubernatorial results (the election law </p><p>gives each state commissioner authority to announce </p><p>results independently), the NTA anchor in Abuja </p><p>reprimanded the reporter on the air not to question </p><p>the procedure.   We also note that where the private </p><p>press has violated electoral rules regarding the media </p><p>but the reporting favored Obasanjo, no sanction has </p><p>been forthcoming.  The independent newspaper,  his </p><p>Day, redicted an Obasanjo victory at the polls and </p><p>published a post-election weekend exit poll in support </p><p>of the President  win prior to the INEC announcement. </p><p>The questionable poll served to confirm previous non- </p><p>existent polls published by a group believed to be </p><p>affiliated with the Vice President  office and used </p><p>to bolster the impression of strong support for the </p><p>PDP. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  The Nigerian government  pique with foreign </p><p>broadcasters is not new; Gana frequently criticizes </p><p>the foreign press when it has reported  bad news about </p><p>Nigeria.  The high stakes that occasion the elections </p><p>have only made Gana and the GON more sensitive.  The </p><p>GON very much wanted the international impression of </p><p>the Nigerian elections to be one of an uncritical </p><p>endorsement of the process and the results.  As this </p><p>has not occurred and significant criticisms have been </p><p>levied, it comes as no surprise that Gana and others </p><p>would blame the foreign press and international </p><p>monitors for being anti-Nigerian. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
