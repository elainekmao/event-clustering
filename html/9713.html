<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 001303 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS, DRL/IRF(BARNES) </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:   N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, KIRF, MV, LTTE - Peace Process, Religious Freedom </p><p>SUBJECT:  IRF report:  Draft 2003 Maldives submission </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  (A) State 194330 </p><p>-      (B) Colombo-IRF 05/23/03 class email </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) This message is Sensitive but Unclassified -- </p><p>Please handle accordingly. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Per the request in Ref A, Mission submits the </p><p>draft 2003 International Religious Freedom report for </p><p>the Maldives.  As also requested in Ref A, a Word </p><p>document with tracked changes based on the 2002 report </p><p>has already been forwarded to the Department (see </p><p>Ref B). </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) The draft 2003 Maldivian IRF report follows: </p><p> </p><p>Begin text: </p><p> </p><p>MALDIVES </p><p> </p><p>The 1997 constitution designates Islam as the official </p><p>state religion and the practice of other religions is </p><p>prohibited by law.  Foreigners are allowed to practice </p><p>their religion only if they do so in private and do not </p><p>encourage Maldivian citizens to participate. </p><p> </p><p>There was no change in the status of respect for </p><p>religious freedom during the period covered by this </p><p>report, and freedom of religion remains severely </p><p>restricted.  The president is the ``supreme authority to </p><p>propagate the tenets of Islam.\'\'  The government </p><p>observes Shari\'a (Islamic law), and severely restricts </p><p>the practice of other faiths. </p><p> </p><p>Citizens regard Islam as one of their society\'s most </p><p>distinctive characteristics and believe that it promotes </p><p>harmony and national identity. </p><p> </p><p>The U.S. Government does not maintain a resident Embassy </p><p>in the Maldives; the U.S. Ambassador in Colombo, Sri </p><p>Lanka, is also accredited to the government in Male. </p><p>The U.S. Government discusses religious freedom issues </p><p>with the government in the context of its overall dialog </p><p>and policy of promoting human rights. </p><p> </p><p>SECTION I. RELIGIOUS DEMOGRAPHY </p><p> </p><p>The Maldives is an archipelago consisting of </p><p>approximately 1,200 coral atolls and islands scattered </p><p>over 500 miles in the Indian Ocean southeast from India, </p><p>and its population is approximately 280,000. </p><p> </p><p>It is believed that the entire indigenous population is </p><p>Muslim, the majority of which adhere to the Sunni branch </p><p>of Islam.  Foreigners in the Maldives -- more than </p><p>300,000 tourists annually (predominantly Europeans and </p><p>Japanese) and about 20,000 foreign workers </p><p>(predominantly Pakistani, Sri Lankan, Indian, and </p><p>Bangladeshi) -- are allowed to practice their religion </p><p>privately only. </p><p> </p><p>SECTION II. STATUS OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOM </p><p> </p><p>Freedom of religion is restricted significantly.  The </p><p>1997 constitution designates Islam as the official state </p><p>religion, and the government interprets this provision </p><p>to impose a requirement that citizens be Muslims. </p><p> </p><p>Foreign residents are allowed to practice their </p><p>religion, if they do so privately, and can not encourage </p><p>Maldivian citizens to participate. </p><p> </p><p>- Restrictions on Religious Freedom </p><p> </p><p>In July 2000, the president stated that no other </p><p>religion will be allowed in the country, and the Home </p><p>Affairs Ministry announced special programs to safeguard </p><p>and strengthen religious unity.  The government has </p><p>established a Supreme Council of Islamic Affairs to </p><p>provide guidance on religious matters.  The government </p><p>also has set standards for individuals who conduct </p><p>Friday services at mosques to ensure adequate </p><p>theological qualifications. </p><p> </p><p>The president must be a Sunni Muslim and under the </p><p>constitution is the ``supreme authority to propagate the </p><p>tenets of Islam.\'\'  Cabinet ministers also are required </p><p>to be Sunni Muslims.  Members of the People\'s Majlis </p><p>(Parliament) must be Muslim.  The government observes </p><p>Shari\'a (Islamic law). </p><p> </p><p>There are no places of worship for adherents of other </p><p>religions.  The government prohibits the importation of </p><p>icons and religious statues but generally permits the </p><p>importation of religious tracts, such as Bibles, for </p><p>personal use. </p><p> </p><p>The government prohibits non-Muslim clergy and </p><p>missionaries from proselytizing and conducting public </p><p>worship services.  Conversion of a Muslim to another </p><p>faith is a violation of Shari\'a and may result in a loss </p><p>of the convert\'s citizenship. </p><p> </p><p>Islamic instruction is a mandatory part of the school </p><p>curriculum, and the government funds the salaries of </p><p>instructors of Islam. </p><p> </p><p>- Abuses of Religious Freedom </p><p> </p><p>The law severely restricts a citizen\'s right to freedom </p><p>of expression in order to protect ``the basic tenets of </p><p>Islam.\'\' </p><p> </p><p>There were no reports of religious detainees or </p><p>prisoners during the period covered by this report. </p><p> </p><p>- Forced Religious Conversion </p><p> </p><p>There were no reports of forced religious conversion, </p><p>including of minor U.S. citizens who had been abducted </p><p>or illegally removed from the United States, or of the </p><p>government\'s refusal to allow such citizens to be </p><p>returned to the United States. </p><p> </p><p>SECTION III. SOCIETAL ATTITUDES </p><p> </p><p>Most citizens regard Islam as one of their society\'s </p><p>most distinctive characteristics and believe that it </p><p>promotes harmony and national identity. </p><p> </p><p>SECTION IV. U.S. GOVERNMENT POLICY </p><p> </p><p>The U.S. Government does not maintain a resident embassy </p><p>in the Maldives; the U.S. Ambassador in Colombo, Sri </p><p>Lanka also is accredited to the government in Male.  The </p><p>U.S. Government discusses religious freedom issues with </p><p>the government in the context of its overall dialog and </p><p>policy of promoting human rights. </p><p> </p><p>End text. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Mission confirms the statement in Section II </p><p>of the above draft that there are no reports of </p><p>religious prisoners or detainees. </p><p> </p><p>ENTWISTLE </p><p></p></div>
