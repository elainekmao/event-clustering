On October 16, 2002 at approximately 11:30AM, a white </p><p>Cessna aircraft traveling northbound was observed by </p><p>witnesses decending over Honduran territory in the vicinity </p><p>of San Jose de La Landa, Honduras.  During the descent </p><p>witnesses observed a suitcase being thrown out of a side door </p><p>of the aircraft. The aircraft subsequently conducted an </p><p>emergency landing (131088N/0871466W) at a hacienda identified </p><p>as La Bodega. The ground was saturated in deep mud at the </p><p>time of the landing.  Witnesses reported seeing a fire rise </p><p>from the area where the aircraft came to rest. </p><p> </p><p>2.  Hours later at approximately 4:00PM local, a Honduran Air </p><p>Force (HOAF) helicopter was observed landing at the site </p><p>remaining for at least 30 minutes.  Witnesses believe that </p><p>only military personnel were initially present at the site. </p><p>Most witnesses were away from the wreckage at the time and </p><p>did not know if anything was removed. Police eventually </p><p>arrived at the scene later that day. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Police do not believe the fire was a result of the crash </p><p>as the wings were left intact adjacent to the charred remains </p><p>of the fuselage loaded with fuel. The rear portion of the </p><p>plane still connected to the aircraft had a heavy smell of </p><p>cocaine.  Several used cans of butane and shreds of </p><p>string/rope were located in the wreckage suggesting the </p><p>traffickers were prepared to burn the aircraft in the event </p><p>of an emergency. </p><p> </p><p>4.  The police arrested two subjects at an unspecified time </p><p>after landing.  Both subjects were taken into custody </p><p>approximately six kilometers from the aircraft site walking </p><p>through farm land.  The pilot was identified as Luis Mauricio </p><p>PALACIO-Giraldo (NADDIS 3070303).  NADDIS records indicate </p><p>that PALACIO is a registered Pilot from Colombia.  The </p><p>passenger was a Guatemalan citizen identified as Jose Ramon </p><p>GAMBOA-Lara. Identifying data on the arrested subjects can be </p><p>found in the indexing section. </p><p> </p><p>5.  PALACIO appeared visibly nervous during questioning.  The </p><p>pilot claimed they departed from San Jose, Costa Rica and </p><p>were destined for Guatemala to display the aircraft to a </p><p>potential buyer.  PALACIO stated he did not know GAMBOA very </p><p>well as GAMBOA was only an agent for the sale of the </p><p>aircraft.  PALACIO was visibly disturbed when police </p><p>questioned him on the submission of a flight plan.  When </p><p>PALACIO was asked who contracted him to fly the plane, </p><p>PALACIO immediately asked for a lawyer.  GAMBOA immediately </p><p>asked for a lawyer when questioned about his association with </p><p>PALACIO. </p><p> </p><p>6.  On October 17, a story appeared in the local newspapers </p><p>reporting the downed aircraft.  Rather than receiving timely </p><p>notification from the Honduran authorities, the TCO found out </p><p>about the incident from the newspaper report. </p><p>The TCO/TAT then inquired with El Centro de la Informacion </p><p>Conjunto (CEINCO) on their knowledge of the issue.  CEINCO is </p><p>the Honduran Joint Intelligence Center (JICC) that acts as a </p><p>central conduit for information sharing and dissemination. </p><p>CEINCO claimed to have no prior knowledge of the incident. </p><p>CEINCO informed the TCO that Police Commander </p><p>Maradiaga-Pancheme in Choluteca, HD most likely acted </p><p>unilaterally to initiate the investigation. </p><p> </p><p>7. The TCO learned that on the morning of the 17th of October </p><p>a team composed of one fiscal and other law enforcement </p><p>personnel found 3.3 kilos of cocaine in the charred remains </p><p>of the aircraft.  Information also indicated that the HOAF </p><p>once again arrived on the scene early that day. </p><p> </p><p>8.  On the afternoon of October 17, 2002, DEA I/A Domingue </p><p>and TAT I/A Scholl traveled to the site accompanied by </p><p>Comisario Jorge Carrias of CEINCO and Comisario </p><p>Maradiaga-Pancheme, Police Chief in Choluteca, HD. Upon </p><p>arrival at the site I/A Domingue retrieved numbers from the </p><p>aircraft motors.  Number 110079 was located on the aircraft </p><p>motor housing.  Number 43371100202 was found on a second </p><p>device attached to the motor.  A third item was documented </p><p>under part# 420930 and associated with serial# FF1093. </p><p>9.  The Honduran police report dated October 18, 2002 </p><p>indicated at 13:00 hours on October 16, 2002, police from </p><p>Department Number 6 received a phone call informing officers </p><p>of the downed aircraft.  The report infers from witness </p><p>accounts that PALACIO and GAMBOA burned the aircraft to </p><p>destroy evidence. Police officers seized $5,300.00 from </p><p>PALACIO and $1,940.00 from GAMBOA.  In addition a Garmin GPS </p><p>and two Nokia cell phones were seized.  The report indicated </p><p>that Honduran Air Force Helicopter 971 was deployed in </p><p>response to the ingress of the unauthorized aircraft after it </p><p>was detected on radar.  Colonel Sarmiento Santos Moya, Major </p><p>Juan Ramon Bautista, Lieutenant Noel Matute Baquedano and </p><p>mechanic Walter Matute were documented as being aboard the </p><p>responding helicopter. </p><p> </p><p>10. Dissemination of information by the Honduran Defense and </p><p>Security agencies is a continuing problem despite the </p><p>thousands of dollars that are invested to create an effective </p><p>operational network.  Information accuracy and timeliness </p><p>rank as top deficiencies that obscure interdiction courses of </p><p>action and chain of command accountability.  There have been </p><p>two prior air ingress events in which Honduran Defense and </p><p>Security agencies failed to intervene or follow up (see ref). </p><p> The TCO later discovered that the Police Director and the </p><p>Minister of Security were informed on Oct 16 of the event yet </p><p>failed to make agreed upon notification to the TCO.  Several </p><p>meetings between U.S. and Honduran officials to formulate </p><p>response procedures and solidify a timely dissemination cycle </p><p>have produced no improvement.  The TCO is left to conclude </p><p>there is an extreme level of apathy about informing the TCO </p><p>or the Honduran authorities purposely choose not to inform </p><p>the TCO. </p><p> </p><p>11. The seized cocaine was tested as positive on October 22, </p><p>2002 by the Criminal Laboratory of the Ministerio Publico. </p><p>The cocaine evidence was assigned control number 6368-2002. </p><p>The TCO will obtain the telephone numbers stored in the </p><p>memory of the seized cellular phones and GPS information to </p><p>exploit for intelligence value. </p><p> </p><p>12. Pursuant to the DEA Agents Manual, section 6242.11, this </p><p>twx is submitted in lieu of a DEA-6. </p><p> </p><p>13. Any questions concerning this cable can be directed to </p><p>C/A Tom Berger, S/A Ivan Rios or I/A John Domingue at </p><p>(301)985-9321. </p><p> </p><p>INDEXING </p><p> </p><p>1.
