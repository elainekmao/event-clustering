<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001031 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PDPA FOR DALTON, MITCHELL AND SIMS </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: GOVERNMENT MEDIA CRITICIZE ARCHBISHOP NCUBE FO </p><p>MEETING WITH SECRETARY POWELL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under headline "Pius Ncube must make his </p><p>      intentions clear" the government-controlled daily </p><p>      "Chronicle\'s" May 22 editorial was critical of Bulawayo </p><p>      Archbishop Pius Ncube for having met with Secretary of </p><p>      State Colin Powell during a recent visit to Washington. </p><p>      Excerpts follow. </p><p> </p><p>  2.   ". . .Instead of us being told that the Archbishop </p><p>      was welcomed by and held talks with fellow Catholics in </p><p>      the U.S., we are told that he met General Colin Powell, </p><p>      the U.S. Secretary of State and a host of secret </p><p>      agents.   General Powell is a military man who got his </p><p>      ego inflated to unimaginable proportions following his </p><p>      escapades in Iraq. . .  Since Gen. Powell insinuated </p><p>      that they (Powell and Ncube) seemed to agree on the </p><p>      main issues, seeing that his (Ncube\'s) stance was </p><p>      `principled,\' this would seem to point to a consensus </p><p>      over the removal of the government of Zimbabwe that was </p><p>      elected in 2002.  Some American Kainsteiner has made it </p><p>      no secret that the U.S. seeks to remove the </p><p>      democratically elected government of Zimbabwe.  It </p><p>      becomes cause for concern if men of the cloth start </p><p>      giving political speeches from the pulpit. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
