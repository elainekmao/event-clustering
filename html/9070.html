<p>UNCLAS OTTAWA 001857 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EB/ESC/ESP (GLASS), S/CT (FOX), IO/PHO (PEREZ), </p><p>AND WHA/CAN </p><p>TREASURY FOR GENERAL COUNSEL (DAVID AUFHAUSER), OFAC </p><p>DIRECTOR (NEWCOMB), TREASURY DAS FOR TERRORISM (ZARATE), </p><p>AND TREASURY TASK FORCE ON TERRORIST FINANCING </p><p>NSC FOR PETERS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETTC, EFIN, PTER, PREL, CVIS, KVPR, CA, UNSC, Iraq, Terrorist Finance </p><p>SUBJECT: TERRORIST FINANCE - OTTAWA: TREASURY LETTER ON </p><p>IRAQI ASSETS </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 186972 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary:  The GOC has received reftel letter and is </p><p>exploring the legal procedures necessary to complete transfer </p><p>of assets to the Iraqi government in compliance with the </p><p>expected notification from the UN 661 Committee.  The frozen </p><p>Iraqi government assets are held by banks, and the GOC does </p><p>not know details of ownership or number of accounts.  The </p><p>Department of Foreign Affairs raised the possibility that the </p><p>GOI might want to keep the C$20,000 in Canada to cover costs </p><p>related to its missions here.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) We confirmed the GOC\'s receipt of the letter </p><p>referred to in reftel and used the opportunity to clarify </p><p>possible procedures for release of Iraqi assets.  Canada has </p><p>approximately C$20,000 in frozen Iraqi government assets and </p><p>the GOC is not aware of any assets in Canada belonging to </p><p>individuals. </p><p> </p><p>Complications </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Although Iraqi government assets were frozen in </p><p>compliance with the UN order after Gulf War I, there was no </p><p>requirement for banks to report details of the accounts to </p><p>the GOC.  Thus the GOC does not know the names of the account </p><p>holders, the exact number of accounts or the total amount in </p><p>each account.  Seizure by the GOC for transfer to the </p><p>Development Fund In Iraq would require a legislative change, </p><p>a lengthy process as parliament has recessed for the summer. </p><p> </p><p>Awaiting notification from the 661 Committee </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) The GOC is waiting for notification from the UN 661 </p><p>Committee in order to finalize the details of its legal </p><p>options.  A lawyer working on the issue agreed that, given </p><p>the fact that the GOC does not know details of the accounts </p><p>and does not have legal authority to transfer the funds </p><p>without legislative action, a letter from a "duly authorized" </p><p>official of the Iraqi government to the Minister of Finance </p><p>and the Minister of Foreign Affairs requesting transfer of </p><p>GOI assets to a specified account (the DFI) might do the </p><p>trick.   The GOC would then issue a general certificate </p><p>authorizing banks to make the transfer.  Banks would make the </p><p>decision on whether they considered the GOI requesting </p><p>official "duly authorized" but would probably follow GOC </p><p>guidance. </p><p> </p><p>Does the Iraqi Government Want to Transfer the Assets? </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p>5. SBU) DFAIT pointed out that a request to transfer the </p><p>assets could depend on GOI plans for its missions in Canada. </p><p>Iraq has real property in Canada (consulates as well as the </p><p>embassy).  DFAIT believes the diplomatic account is in </p><p>arrears, and there may be property taxes outstanding.  If </p><p>Iraq plans to sell its missions, it would make sense to </p><p>transfer the funds, but if the GOI plans to maintain a </p><p>diplomatic presence in Canada it may wish to keep the funds </p><p>for use here. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
