Erdogan said that such an operation could not be </p><p>realize without a coalition.  Erdogan added that PM Gul will </p><p>be traveling to the Middle East soon to seek support from </p><p>Arab countries.  "Hurriyet" reports the same news under the </p><p>headline `Middle East trip for Saddam,\' and states that AKP </p><p>leader Erdogan will travel to the region this month to seek </p><p>support.  Citing the US media, "Hurriyet" also reports that </p><p>the Pentagon plans to launch an international public </p><p>relations campaign, which will include bribing some </p><p>journalists to print pro-American stories.  "Sabah" reports </p><p>that PM Gul denied reports that the US has delivered 50 </p><p>truck-loads of military equipment to Iraq.  Gul confirms </p><p>claims that DepSecDef Wolfowitz and U/S Grossman had </p><p>presented US demands to Turkey during their recent visit. </p><p>However, the PM  stressed that Turkey has not yet responded </p><p>to these requests.  "Milliyet" reports that Turkey has </p><p>deployed nearly 40,000 troops along the Iraqi border in </p><p>preparation for a possible operation.  These troops could be </p><p>increased in line with developments.  "Yeni Safak" reports </p><p>that Turkey would play a limited role in a possible war </p><p>against Iraq, because the US is afraid of a possible clash </p><p>between Turks and Kurds. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Cyprus: "Cumhuriyet" reports on the heated argument between </p><p>CHP leader Baykal and FM Yakis in parliament yesterday over </p><p>the FM\'s statement that `Turkish troops would become </p><p>occupiers of EU territory if the UN Cyprus plan is </p><p>rejected.\'  There are rumors that Yakis will be given a new </p><p>assignment when Erdogan becomes Prime Minister and Gul is </p><p>moved to Foreign Minister.  "Sabah" reports that the Greek </p><p>Cypriots have launched a peace campaign in support of </p><p>Annan\'s Cyprus plan.  The goal of the Greek Cypriots is to </p><p>ensure Turkish support for the plan, thus securing EU entry </p><p>of a United Cyprus.  All papers report that there will be a </p><p>summit at the Presidential Palace today to discuss Turkey\'s </p><p>foreign policy. President Sezer will chair the meeting, </p><p>which will also include PM Gul, FM Yakis, Chief of General </p><p>Staff Ozkok, and Foreign Ministry U/S Ziyal.  After this </p><p>meeting, there will be a second meeting with the </p><p>participation of TRNC president Denktas to discuss the </p><p>Cyprus issue in more detail. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION:  Iraq-US/Turkey </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The US war plan" </p><p>Editor-in-Chief of the tabloid "Star," Fatih Cekirge, </p><p>claimed (12/18): "Two weeks ago, the Turkish Ambassador to </p><p>Washington was summoned to the State Department.  During the </p><p>meeting he was officially notified about the US war plan for </p><p>Iraq and was presented with a list of US demands from </p><p>Turkey.  The plan includes the use of Turkish airbases as </p><p>well as Turkish territory.  The capacity of the airbases </p><p>will be expanded for the use of the American air force, and </p><p>US grounds troops will launch a military operation from </p><p>Turkish soil into northern Iraq. . The meeting in Ankara at </p><p>the presidential palace today is to make a crucial decision </p><p>about this plan.  Ankara feels uneasy about it, yet the </p><p>message from Washington is clear enough: Ankara must support </p><p>the plan in exchange for Washington\'s recent support for </p><p>Turkey\'s EU membership accession.  We will see if the AKP </p><p>government will push for a `yes\' to the plan, thereby </p><p>putting Turkey into very big trouble." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"An Iraq operation and the economy" </p><p>Fatih Altayli argued in mass appeal Hurriyet (12/18): </p><p>"Sooner or later there is going to be a military operation </p><p>against Iraq.  This is not going to happen because of </p><p>weapons of mass destruction or terrorism, but because the US </p><p>economy is in need of it.  The future of the US economy </p><p>depends on an operation.  US economic figures are not very </p><p>encouraging at the moment, with ongoing stagflation, lots of </p><p>bankrupt firms, a large number of unemployed and so on. . It </p><p>seems that the hope for a better economic future for America </p><p>goes through a military strike against Iraq." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
