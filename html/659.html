<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L HAVANA 002542 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FOR ARACCA -- DENNIS HAYS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:      OADR:DECL </p><p>TAGS:      PGOV, CU </p><p>SUBJECT:   RUMORS OF CASTRO\'S ILL HEALTH -- UPDATE </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) HAVANA 2484; B) HAVANA 2455; C) FBIS 201404Z APR 94 </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL -- ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  THE STATUS OF THE RUMORS REGARDING CASTRO\'S HEALTH: </p><p>THE RUMOR HAS SPREAD TO MUCH OF THE HAVANA POPULATION </p><p>AND COMES IN TWO VARIATIONS:  THAT CASTRO HAS AN </p><p>ISCHEMIA OF THE BRAIN AND THE OTHER, THAT THIS WAS </p><p>BROUGHT ON BY AN ATTEMPT ON HIS LIFE.  ONE VERSION OF </p><p>THE RUMOR HAS IT THAT CASTRO CANNOT BE MOVED BECAUSE OF </p><p>THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE ILLNESS, BUT THAT CIMEQ HOSPITAL </p><p>HAS BEEN PREPARED FOR HIM ONCE HIS CONDITION </p><p>STABILIZES.  (THIS WOULD IN EFFECT RESOLVE THE </p><p>DIFFERENCES BETWEEN RUMORS THAT WE HAD HEARD REFS A,B.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  RAUL CASTRO HAS BEEN FEATURED FAR MORE PROMINENTLY </p><p>IN THE CUBAN MEDIA IN THE LAST FEW DAYS, INCLUDING HIS </p><p>SPEECH IN GUANTANAMO OVER THE WEEKEND AND A FRONT PAGE </p><p>PHOTO IN THE APRIL 20 GRANMA, WITH ANOTHER STORY ON THE </p><p>BACKPAGE.  (RAUL SOMETIMES GETS FRONT PAGE COVERAGE, BUT </p><p>IT IS UNUSUAL FOR HIM TO GET SO MUCH ATTENTION IN THE </p><p>SAME EDITION.)  ONE OTHER ODDITY:  IN THE APRIL 20 </p><p>"DOING RADIO" PROGRAM ON RADIO REBELDE (REF C), MIAMI </p><p>CORRESPONDENT MARCOS CASTELLO NOTES HOW THE EXILE </p><p>COMMUNITY IS TRYING TO "MAR THE LEGITIMACY" OF THIS </p><p>WEEKEND\'S DIALOGUE.  AS AN EXAMPLE, HE REPORTED THAT </p><p>THERE WERE REPORTS IN MIAMI THAT THERE WAS "AN ALLEGED </p><p>PROBLEM" WITH CASTRO AND THAT "A HOSPITAL HAS BEEN TAKEN </p><p>OVER." </p><p> </p><p>4.  WE HOPE TO HEAR FROM OUR ACTIVIST CONTACTS WITHIN </p><p>THE NEXT DAY OR TWO. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
