<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 OTTAWA 001721 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR OES (WATSON), OES/EGC (REIFSNEIDER, DEROSA), </p><p>EB/ESC/ISC (MCMANUS, DUDLEY), WHA/CAN (MASON, RUNNING, </p><p>NORMAN) </p><p> </p><p>USDOC FOR ITA/MAC -- OFFICE OF NAFTA </p><p> </p><p>DOE FOR INT\'L AND POLICY (PUMPHREY AND PERSON), IE-141 </p><p>(DEUTSCH) AND BPA (ATKINS) </p><p> </p><p>EPA FOR OFFICE OF THE ADMINISTRATOR, INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS </p><p>AND BRIAN MCLEAN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ENRG, CA </p><p>SUBJECT: INTERNATIONAL PARTNERSHIP FOR THE HYDROGEN ECONOMY: </p><p>      CANADIAN REACTIONS </p><p> </p><p>REF:      (A) STATE 146268 </p><p> </p><p>      (B) STATE 153914 </p><p> </p><p>1. SUMMARY:  GOC OFFICIALS APPEAR TO BE CAUTIOUSLY </p><p>INTERESTED IN PARTICIPATING IN THE IPHE, BUT HAVE </p><p>SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS ABOUT HOW IPHE WILL RELATE TO THE IEA\'S </p><p>HYDROGEN COORDINATION GROUP.  THEY ALSO POSED NUMEROUS </p><p>QUESTIONS ABOUT IPHE\'S POSSIBLE STRUCTURE AND PROCESS - SEE </p><p>ACTION REQUESTED, PARAGRAPH 7.  THIS INITIATIVE WILL REQUIRE </p><p>SOME SELLING AT THE POLITICAL LEVEL, AND TO THIS END WE URGE </p><p>WASHINGTON AGENCIES TO CONSIDER VISITS TO OTTAWA BY SENIOR </p><p>OFFICIALS FROM DOE AND STATE TO PROMOTE THE IPHE.    END </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>2.    EMBASSY ESTH COUNSELOR AND ENERGY SPECIALIST DISCUSSED </p><p>THE USG\'S PROPOSAL FOR THE INTERNATIONAL PARTNERSHIP FOR THE </p><p>HYDROGEN ECONOMY (IPHE) WITH KEY OFFICIALS AT NATURAL </p><p>RESOURCES CANADA (NRCAN) ON JUNE 16.  NRCAN PERSONNEL WERE </p><p>FAMILIAR WITH THE PROPOSAL:  ALL HAD SEEN THE INFORMATION </p><p>PROVIDED IN REFTEL A, SOME HAD HEARD SECRETARY ABRAHAM\'S </p><p>INVITATION AT THE IEA MINISTERIAL IN APRIL, AND OTHERS HAD </p><p>SEEN A PRESENTATION BY DOE\'S CHRIS BORDEAUX AT THE MOST </p><p>RECENT MEETING OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY EXPERTS UNDER THE </p><p>NORTH AMERICAN ENERGY WORKING GROUP IN OTTAWA ON JUNE 5. </p><p> </p><p>3.   CANADIAN OFFICIALS\' MOST IMPORTANT QUESTIONS WITH </p><p>RESPECT TO IPHE PERTAINED TO ITS RELATIONSHIP TO THE IEA\'S </p><p>HYDROGEN COORDINATION GROUP (REF B).  NOTING THAT THE WORK </p><p>BEING PURSUED IN THAT FORUM IS SUBSTANTIVE AND IS ALREADY </p><p>WELL UNDERWAY, THEY EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT THE IPHE </p><p>INITIATIVE WOULD DUPLICATE WHAT WAS ALREADY BEING DONE IN </p><p>THE IEA CONTEXT AND/OR THAT IT WOULD SPREAD THE GOC\'S </p><p>AVAILABLE RESOURCES TOO THIN.  IN ADDITION, NRCAN OFFICIALS </p><p>RAISED QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW THE IPHE PROCESS WOULD RELATE TO </p><p>IEA EFFORTS ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTEROPERABLE CODES AND </p><p>STANDARDS. </p><p> </p><p>4.   CANADIAN OFFICIALS INQUIRED BRIEFLY ABOUT SECRETARY </p><p>ABRAHAM\'S EFFORT TO PROMOTE THE IPHE AMONG PROSPECTIVE </p><p>MEMBERS DURING VISITS TO THEIR CAPITALS.  (COMMENT:  THE </p><p>FACT THAT SECRETARY ABRAHAM HAS PROMOTED THE IPHE DIRECTLY </p><p>WITH THE EU AND OTHER FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS, BUT HAS NOT DONE </p><p>SO WITH CANADA, MAKES THIS A SENSITIVE TOPIC IN OTTAWA.  END </p><p>COMMENT). </p><p> </p><p>5.   OUR INTERLOCUTORS WERE INTERESTED IN THE POSSIBLE </p><p>FORMAT OF THE PROSPECTIVE MEETING TO LAUNCH THE IPHE IN FALL </p><p>2003.  THEY RECOMMENDED STRONGLY THAT WE NOT TRY TO HOLD </p><p>MEETINGS AT THE POLICY AND TECHNICAL LEVELS SIMULTANEOUSLY </p><p>(CITING THE CASE OF THE CARBON SEQUESTRATION LEADERSHIP </p><p>FORUM), BUT RATHER THAT WE PUT POLICY ISSUES FIRST AND THEN </p><p>DEAL SEPARATELY WITH STRUCTURAL AND TECHNICAL MATTERS. </p><p> </p><p>6.   OTHER ISSUES IN WHICH NRCAN SHOWED INTEREST INCLUDED: </p><p> </p><p>-- THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE IPHE\'S TIME FRAMES (I.E. IS IT </p><p>REALISTIC TO MAKE HYDROGEN THE "TRANSPORTATION FUEL OF </p><p>CHOICE" BY 2020?); </p><p> </p><p>-- WHETHER INDIA AND CHINA WERE LIKELY TO PARTICIPATE; </p><p> </p><p>-- HOW THE IPHE SECRETARIAT WOULD BE STRUCTURED AND WHERE IT </p><p>MIGHT BE LOCATED; </p><p> </p><p>-- HOW INDUSTRY/PRIVATE SECTOR GROUPS WOULD BE INVOLVED IN </p><p>THE PARTNERSHIP; </p><p> </p><p>-- HOW WILL IPR ISSUES BE HANDLED; </p><p> </p><p>-- WHETHER U.S. STATES AND/OR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS BE INVOLVED </p><p>IN THE PARTNERSHIP (NRCAN UNDERSTANDS THAT CALIFORNIA AND </p><p>OTHER STATES HAVE BEEN ACTIVE ON HYDROGEN AND FUEL CELL </p><p>DEVELOPMENT); </p><p> </p><p>-- WHETHER THE IPHE WILL ENGAGE IN ACTUAL PROJECTS, OR JUST </p><p>BE A FORUM FOR EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION; AND </p><p> </p><p>-- HOW IPHE MIGHT CONNECT TO CSLF. </p><p>7. ACTION REQUESTED:  BASED ON OUR DISCUSSIONS THUS FAR, IT </p><p>IS CLEAR THAT THE GOC IS INTERESTED IN THE IPHE AND GIVING </p><p>IT CAREFUL CONSIDERATION. HOWEVER, OFFICIALS ARE ALSO </p><p>CONCERNED ABOUT ORGANIZATIONAL DETAILS AND ABOUT THE </p><p>POSSIBLE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS NEW PARTNERSHIP INITIATIVE FOR </p><p>EXISTING BILATERAL AND MULTILATERAL (PARTICULARLY IEA) </p><p>COOPERATION ON HYDROGEN TECHNOLOGIES AND FUEL CELLS. </p><p>REQUEST THAT WASHINGTON PROVIDED RESPONSES FOR QUESTIONS AND </p><p>CONCERNS RAISED IN PARAGRAPHS 2, 4 AND 5 ABOVE SO THAT WE </p><p>CAN REASSURE THE GOC ON THESE ISSUES TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE. </p><p>END ACTION REQUESTED. </p><p> </p><p>8. OUR MEETING WITH NRCAN OFFICIALS WAS CLEARLY INCONCLUSIVE </p><p>WITH REGARD TO CANADIAN PARTICIPATION IN THE IPHE, </p><p>PARTICULARLY SINCE IT INVOLVED ONLY ONE AGENCY OF THE </p><p>SEVERAL IN THE CANADIAN GOVERNMENT THAT WOULD PRESUMABLY </p><p>PLAY A ROLE IN DECIDING ON CANADIAN PARTICIPATION.  THE U.S. </p><p>PROPOSAL FOR AN INTERNATIONAL PARTNERSHIP HAS RAISED A </p><p>NUMBER OF BASIC QUESTIONS THAT THE GOC WILL HAVE TO WRESTLE </p><p>WITH AS THEY CONSIDER HOW TO RESPOND.  ANY ADDITIONAL </p><p>INFORMATION THAT WASHINGTON AGENCIES MAY BE ABLE TO PROVIDE </p><p>TO US WILL BE USEFUL IN ENGAGING NRCAN AND OTHER CANADIAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT AGENCIES ON THE IPHE PROPOSAL.  FINALLY, BEYOND </p><p>ALL THE TECHNICAL AND BUREAUCRATIC ISSUES THAT WE HAVE </p><p>ENCOUNTERED IN OUR INITIAL DISCUSSIONS WITH GOC OFFICIALS, </p><p>THERE IS A NEED TO SELL THE CONCEPT AT THE POLITICAL LEVEL </p><p>IF WE ARE SERIOUS ABOUT ENGAGING CANADA IN THE IPHE.  THAT </p><p>IS AN EFFORT THAT WE EXPECT THE AMBASSADOR TO BE FULLY </p><p>INVOLVED IN, ONCE WE HAVE THE INFORMATION TO RESPOND TO SOME </p><p>OF THE BASIC ISSUES RAISED ABOVE.  HOWEVER, WE WOULD ALSO </p><p>URGE WASHINGTON AGENCIES TO CONSIDER VISITS TO OTTAWA BY </p><p>SENIOR OFFICIALS FROM DOE AND STATE TO PROMOTE THE IPHE. </p><p> </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
