<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L HARARE 001267 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>AF/FO, AF/S </p><p>NSC FOR AFRICA SR DIR FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/23/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINS, ZI, MDC </p><p>SUBJECT: MDC LEADER TSVANGIRAI WELL AND DETERMINED TO MOVE </p><p>FORWARD </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: JOSEPH G. SULLIVAN FOR REASONS 1.5B/D </p><p> </p><p>1.(c) Tsvangirai released: The Ambassador met MDC President </p><p>Morgan Tsvangirai at his home on June 23.  Except for a bad </p><p>cold, he was upbeat and determined following his June 20 </p><p>release from prison after two weeks.  Tsvangirai expressed </p><p>appreciation for the many messages of solidarity received and </p><p>for the public pressure for his release and for a political </p><p>solution to Zimbabwe\'s crisis. Tsvangirai was stoic and </p><p>strong and determined that neither he nor the MDC would be </p><p>broken through GOZ tactics of violence, intimidation or </p><p>humiliation.  He acknowledged that his family had feared for </p><p>his fate inside prison, but said that he was not mistreated </p><p>by the guards and that the prisoners were very supportive. </p><p>He suffered only as other prisoners suffered, 150 to a large </p><p>cell with poor food and inadequate cover for the cold winter </p><p>nights.  Tsvangirai hopes that this second treason charge </p><p>will never be taken to court and that the first treason </p><p>charge will be dismissed shortly based on a defense motion </p><p>following the conclusion of state testimony. </p><p> </p><p>2. (c) MDC politics: Tsvangirai said that the MDC would never </p><p>be lured into ZANU/PF efforts to divide the MDC and to play </p><p>up to a supposed moderate group led by Sec Gen Welshman </p><p>Ncube. Tsvangirai said that all recognized that the MDC </p><p>derived its strength from unified positions and that anyone </p><p>acting outside the party had little weight.  The Party would </p><p>be meeting in the next week to chart the way forward, but, </p><p>while mass action was still part of MDC options, Tsvangirai </p><p>did not anticipate any such action in the near term.  Nor did </p><p>he believe that pressure for violent action would grow within </p><p>the MDC. </p><p> </p><p>3. (c) President Bush\'s travel to Africa/ Need for a roadmap: </p><p>Tsvangirai was very focused on President Bush\'s upcoming </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>travel to Africa and anxious that Zimbabwe be raised </p><p>prominently by the US during the visit.  Tsvangirai said that </p><p>what was needed was a "roadmap for resolving the political </p><p>crisis.  The first and most difficult was finding a dignified </p><p>way for Mugabe to step down.  A transition process was next, </p><p>although its length would depend on the shape and content of </p><p>a transition. Elections were also  critical to restore </p><p>legitimacy; their timing would depend on the transition. </p><p>Tsvangirai promised to keep us informed of the status of </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>negotiations efforts in anticipation of President Bush\'s </p><p>visit. </p><p> </p><p>4. (c) South African and other mediation efforts:  Tsvangirai </p><p>described South African efforts to broker a solution so far </p><p>as "talks about the conditions and content of inter-party </p><p>talks.  He did take some comfort in a reportedly tough </p><p>message delivered to Mugabe by Vice President Jacob Zuma </p><p>following President Mbeki\'s discussions at the G-8 meetings </p><p>to the effect that South Africa could not wait indefinitely </p><p>for a solution to the Zimbabwean crisis.  Tsvangirai believed </p><p>that the South Africans had belatedly accepted that the MDC </p><p>was essential to a solution and that eventual elections were </p><p>also necessary.  Nonetheless, the South Africans gave </p><p>preference to stability over democracy and would most like to </p><p>see the MDC absorbed as a junior partner in a ZANU-PF </p><p>government.  Tsvangirai said he would also be open to any </p><p>efforts by Father Fidelis to arrange an "ice-breaking" </p><p>meeting between Mugabe and Tsvangirai.  Similarly, Tsvangirai </p><p>viewed meetings between a Church delegation and senior </p><p>ZANU-PF leaders as potentially useful because of the </p><p>seniority of the ZANU delegation.  However, Tsvangirai was </p><p>skeptical of apparently independent initiatives by State </p><p>Security Minister Goche seeking to talk with Welshman Ncube </p><p>during Tsvangirai\'s imprisonment and by Justice Minister </p><p>Chinamassa offering Tsvangirai the Vice Presidency in a </p><p>Mnangagwa Presidency.  Tsvangirai noted that President Mugabe </p><p>appeared to show no urgency in finding a solution and to </p><p>continue searching for a succession formula dominated by </p><p>ZANU-PF. </p><p> </p><p>5.(c) Comment:  ZANU-PF\'s effort to take advantage of its </p><p>suppression of MDC-organized marches, its demonstrated </p><p>control of the security forces and its ability to imprison </p><p>and humiliate Tsvangirai have not succeeded.  Tsvangirai has </p><p>emerged undeterred and ZANU-PF will have to recognize the </p><p>need to deal with him and the MDC in order to resolve the </p><p>national crisis. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
