<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L RANGOON 001321 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/10/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, TH, BM </p><p>SUBJECT: THAI/BURMESE AGREEMENT TO REOPEN THE BORDER </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: COM Carmen Martinez. Reason: 1.5 (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary:  Thai Permanent Secretary Tej Bunnag told the </p><p>Burmese October 7 in Rangoon that the Thai cabinet decided to </p><p>prohibit any Thai-based groups from attacking neighboring </p><p>countries, according to Thai embassy sources.  He also </p><p>reportedly said that Prime Minister Thaksin so instructed the </p><p>new Minister of Defense.  The Burmese were evidently </p><p>satisfied.  All border crossings are to reopen on October 15. </p><p> End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) According to Thai embassy sources, the agreed minutes </p><p>of the October 7 meeting between Thai Permanent Secretary Tej </p><p>Bunnag and Burma\'s Deputy Foreign Minister Khin Maung Win </p><p>were pre-cooked with an eye to public consumption in </p><p>Thailand.  However, Bunnag also provided oral assurances </p><p>regarding security as part of the negotiations to reopen the </p><p>border.  Basically, Bunnag briefed the Burmese on the Thai </p><p>cabinet decision (reportedly taken on June 28) not to allow </p><p>any groups to use Thai territory for attacks on neighboring </p><p>countries.  Bunnag also told the Burmese that Prime Minister </p><p>Thaksin had directly instructed new Thai Defense Minister </p><p>Thammarak to relay that decision to the First and Third Army </p><p>Commanders, and to ensure that both complied. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Other issues incorporated in the agreed minutes </p><p>included narcotics cooperation, border trade, illegal </p><p>workers, and refugees.  On border trade, the Thais agreed </p><p>that all transactions will have to be settled in accordance </p><p>with Burmese trade rules, which now require letters of credit </p><p>rather than telex transfers or cash payments.  On illegal </p><p>workers, the two sides agreed to hold the next joint task </p><p>force meeting in Yangon on November 11.  On the other two </p><p>issues -- refugees and counternarcotics -- the decision was </p><p>simply to renew discussions and cooperation on the same terms </p><p>as before. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Thai embassy sources also said that the agreement to </p><p>open the border covered all border crossing points, and not </p><p>just the three major crossings, as reported in the press.  On </p><p>October 15, the three major crossings at Kawthoung, Myawaddy, </p><p>and Tachileik will all be open, as well as all 20 smaller </p><p>crossing points, this source claimed. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Finally, Thai embassy sources emphasized that </p><p>relations between Burma and Thailand were still far from </p><p>normal, despite the agreement on opening the border.  The </p><p>newspaper references to Thailand as "Yodya" and the ban on </p><p>advertising of Thai products still continued.  Nevertheless, </p><p>the Thai embassy was hopeful that those irritating measures </p><p>would also end as news of the agreement filtered through the </p><p>Burmese bureaucracy. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) An improvement in Thai-Burma relations may bolster the </p><p>chances of cooperation on narcotics and other regional </p><p>issues.  It could also serve to reduce the regime\'s concerns </p><p>about perceived Thai support for Burma\'s ethnic insurgents. </p><p>Such a reduction could possibly bolster the confidence of </p><p>some SPDC members on beginning serious dialogue with the NLD </p><p>and ethnics, although other regime supporters would just be </p><p>glad to see troubles on the Thai border diminish.  End </p><p>Comment. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
