(U) SUMMARY: IN HIS AUGUST 1 ANGELUS MESSAGE, POPE JOHN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  03986  01 OF 02  150143Z </p><p>PAUL II MADE A STRONG AND EMOTIONAL APPEAL FOR PEACE IN THE </p><p>MIDDLE EAST, CALLING ON ISRAELITES AND PALESTINIANS TO RETURN </p><p>TO THE PATH OF NEGOTIATIONS, AND URGING THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>COMMUNITY TO COMMIT ITSELF TO A PRESENCE IN THE REGION "TO </p><p>CREATE THE CONDITIONS FOR A PRODUCTIVE DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE </p><p>PARTIES.  THE POPE FORCEFULLY STATED THAT "THERE IS NO </p><p>JUSTIFICATION FOR THOSE WHO INDISCRIMINATELY KILL INNOCENT </p><p>DEFENSELESS CIVILIANS."  HE EXPRESSED HIS CONCERN FOR THE </p><p>PLIGHT OF BOTH THE PALESTINIANS AND ISRAELIS, AND EMPHASIZED </p><p>THAT NEITHER ATTACKS, ARMS, NOR WALLS OF SEPARATION WOULD </p><p>LEAD TO A JUST SOLUTION.  FINALLY, CALLING ATTENTION TO THE </p><p>INABILITY OF WORSHIPERS TO ATTEND SERVICES BECAUSE OF THE </p><p>CURFEWS, HE CONDEMNED WHAT HE TERMED A RESTRICTION ON FREEDOM </p><p>OF RELIGION AND APPEALED TO CHRISTIANS LIVING IN THE HOLY </p><p>LANDS NOT TO ABANDON THE REGION DESPITE THE CURRENT TROUBLES. </p><p> END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>POPE ANGUISHED BY CONTINUING VIOLENCE </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) IN HIS FIRST SUNDAY ANGELUS MESSAGE SINCE HIS RETURN </p><p>FROM CANADA, GUATEMALA AND MEXICO, POPE JOHN PAUL II CHOSE TO </p><p>MAKE A POINTED APPEAL FOR AN END TO VIOLENCE IN THE MIDDLE </p><p>EAST.  OBSERVING THAT HE "CAN\'T STOP THINKING" ABOUT THE HOLY </p><p>LANDS WHOSE PEOPLE HAVE NO RESPITE FROM THE "ALMOST DAILY </p><p>EPISODES OF ABOMINABLE VIOLENCE," THE POPE ASKED RHETORICALLY </p><p>WHEN THE ISRAELI AND PALESTINIAN PEOPLE WOULD COME TO </p><p>UNDERSTAND THAT THE ABILITY TO LIVE TOGETHER "DOES NOT SPRING </p><p>FROM ARMS."  "NEITHER ATTACKS, NOR WALLS OF SEPARATION, NOR </p><p>RETALIATION WILL EVER LEAD TO AN EQUITABLE SOLUTION OF THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  03986  01 OF 02  150143Z </p><p>CURRENT CONFLICT."  HE SAID HE SUFFERS WITH THOSE WHO MOURN </p><p>THE DESTRUCTION, PARTICULARLY THE INNOCENTS WHO ARE PAYING </p><p>THE PRICE OF THE CURRENT VIOLENCE. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>NO JUSTIFICATION FOR TERROR </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) REINFORCING HIS REJECTION OF TERROR IN ALL FORMS, THE </p><p>POPE SAID HE WANTED TO REPEAT TO ALL FROM WHATEVER ETHNIC </p><p>GROUP THEY BELONG TO, THAT "THERE IS NO JUSTIFICATION FOR </p><p>THOSE WHO INDISCRIMINATELY KILL INNOCENT DEFENSELESS </p><p>CIVILIANS."  CONVEYING EQUAL CONCERN FOR THE SUFFERING OF </p><p>BOTH SIDES, THE POPE OBSERVED THAT FROM 1967 TO THE PRESENT </p><p>THERE HAS BEEN "A TERRIBLE SUCCESSION OF UNSPEAKABLE </p><p>SUFFERING: SUFFERING OF THE PALESTINIANS, HUNTED FROM THEIR </p><p>OWN LANDS OR CONSTRAINED, IN RECENT TIMES, TO A STATE OF </p><p>PERMANENT SIEGE, OBJECTS OF A SORT OF COLLECTIVE PUNISHMENT; </p><p>SUFFERING OF THE ISRAELI POPULATION WHICH LIVES IN DAILY </p><p>TERROR OF BEING BOMBED BY ANONYMOUS ATTACKERS." </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>APPEAL FOR INTERNATIONAL PRESENCE </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) IN RECENT DISCUSSIONS, THE HOLY SEE HAS INTENSIFIED </p><p>ITS PUSH FOR SOME FORM OF INTERNATIONAL INTERPOSITION FORCE </p><p>ON THE GROUND IN THE REGION (REFTELS).  REINFORCING THIS </p><p>MESSAGE, THE POPE CALLED ON THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY "TO </p><p>COMMIT ITSELF WITH GREAT DETERMINATION TO BE PRESENT ON THE </p><p>GROUND, OFFERING THE NEEDED MEDIATION TO CREATE THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  03986  01 OF 02  150143Z </p><p>CONDITIONS FOR A PRODUCTIVE DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE PARTIES." </p><p>AT THE SAME TIME, HE APPEALED TO THE ISRAELIS AND </p><p>PALESTINIANS TO RETURN TO HONEST NEGOTIATIONS." </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p>POPE SEES FREEDOM OF RELIGION RESTRICTED IN HOLY LANDS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) ADDING URGENCY TO HIS APPEAL TO PEACE, THE POPE </p><p>REITERATED HIS CONCERN FOR CHRISTIANS IN THE HOLY LANDS -- </p><p>MANY OF WHOM HAVE BEEN EMIGRATING TO ESCAPE THE VIOLENCE AND </p><p>LACK OF OPPORTUNITY IN THE STRIFE-TORN REGION.  IN THIS </p><p>CONNECTION, THE POPE ASSERTED THAT THE CURRENT RIGID CURFEW </p><p>IMPOSED BY THE ISRAELIS HAD RESULTED IN A FUNDAMENTAL </p><p>VIOLATION OF THE FREEDOM OF RELIGION, AS BELIEVERS OF ALL </p><p>FAITHS NO LONGER HAD ACCESS TO PLACES OF WORSHIP. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ0393 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        VATICA  03986  02 OF 02  131621Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AMAD-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DODE-00  WHA-00 </p><p>      PERC-00  DS-00    VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   VCE-00   NEA-00 </p><p>      NSAE-00  DSCC-00  DRL-02   NFAT-00  SAS-00     /002W </p><p>                  ------------------D89D77  131621Z /38 </p><p>R 131615Z AUG 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY VATICAN </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC </p><p>INFO ARAB ISRAELI COLLECTIVE </p><p>EUROPEAN POLITICAL COLLECTIVE </p><p>AMCONSUL JERUSALEM </p><p>USINT HAVANA </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 VATICAN 003986 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR S (CKELLY), EUR/WE MENNUTI AND NEA/IPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/13/2012 </p><p>TAGS: IS, PREL, PHUM, KIRF, VT </p><p>SUBJECT: POPE APPEALS FOR INTERNATIONAL PRESENCE IN MIDDLE </p><p>EAST; RETURN TO NEGOTIATIONS </p><p> </p><p>6.
