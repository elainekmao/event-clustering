<p>UNCLAS DJIBOUTI 000401 </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/E </p><p>CENTCOM ALSO FOR POLAD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, DJ </p><p>SUBJECT: DJIBOUTI: NEW PRIME MINISTER NAMED </p><p> </p><p>REF: DJIBOUTI 00265 </p><p> </p><p>1.  PRESIDENT ISMAIL OMAR GUELLEH ANNOUNCED ON MARCH 4 </p><p>THE APPOINTMENT OF DILEITA MOHAMED DILEITA AS PRIME </p><p>MINISTER.  DILEITA IS AN AFAR, AND IS PRESENTLY </p><p>DJIBOUTIAN AMBASSADOR TO ETHIOPIA.  THE PREVIOUS PRIME </p><p>MINISTER, BARKAT GOURAD HAMADOU, RESIGNED FEBRUARY 6 </p><p>BECAUSE OF POOR HEALTH, REF A.  SINCE INDEPENDENCE IN </p><p>1977 THE PRESIDENT HAS TRADITIONALLY BEEN AN ISSA AND </p><p>THE PRIME MINISTER AN AFAR.  THERE IS SPECULATION, </p><p>INCLUDING BY THE GOVERNMENT NEWS AGENCY, THAT </p><p>DILEITA\'S APPOINTMENT IS THE BEGINNING OF A CABINET </p><p>RESHUFFLE.  THE POSITION OF PRIME MINISTER IS LARGELY </p><p>CEREMONIAL, WIELDING LITTLE POWER. </p><p> </p><p>2.  THE APPOINTMENT IS AN INTERESTING COMPROMISE, </p><p>BECAUSE DILEITA IS NOT A PARTY MEMBER OF EITHER THE </p><p>RULING RPP, OR THE OPPOSITION FRUD.  HE IS KNOWN TO BE </p><p>CLOSE TO THE FORMER PRIME MINISTER.  MOST PEOPLE HAD </p><p>PREDICTED THAT ONE OF THE PROMINENT AFARS IN THE RPP </p><p>WHO ARE MEMBERS OF THE CABINET WOULD GET THE NOD, SUCH </p><p>AS ALI GUELLEH ABOUBAKER, PRESIDENTIAL CHIEF OF STAFF; </p><p>MOHAMED DINI FARAH, MINISTER OF HEALTH; OR ALI MOHAMED </p><p>DAOUD, MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  DILEITA MOHAMED DILEITA WAS BORN MARCH 12, 1958 IN </p><p>TADJOURAH, DJIBOUTI TO AN INFLUENTIAL FAMILY.  HE WENT </p><p>TO HIGH SCHOOL IN CAIRO, EGYPT AND RHEIMS, FRANCE, AND </p><p>RECEIVED A DEGREE IN FOREIGN AFFAIRS FROM A COLLEGE IN </p><p>MEDEA, ALGERIA IN 1981.  THE NEXT YEAR HE BEGAN A </p><p>DIPLOMATIC CAREER IN THE DJIBOUTIAN FOREIGN MINISTRY. </p><p>BY 1985 HE HAD THE RANK OF EMBASSY COUNSELOR, BUT </p><p>REMAINED IN DJIBOUTI.  IN 1986 HE TRAINED IN THE </p><p>FRENCH MINISTRIES OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND DEVELOPMENT. </p><p>IN 1988 HE BECAME DEPUTY HEAD OF PROTOCOL IN THE </p><p>PRESIDENT\'S OFFICE.  IN 1993 HE BECAME COUNSELOR FOR </p><p>CONSULAR AFFAIRS AT THE DJIBOUTAN EMBASSY IN PARIS, </p><p>WHERE HE REMAINED UNTIL BEING APPOINTED AMBASSADOR TO </p><p>ETHIOPIA IN 1996.  HE IS DIVORCED WITH ONE CHILD. </p><p> </p><p>4.  BARKAT, AGE 70, HAD BEEN PRIME MINISTER FOR 22 </p><p>YEARS.  FOLLOWING A STROKE MARCH 11, 2000, HE SPENT </p><p>SIX MONTHS IN A PARIS HOSPITAL.  HE RETURNED TO </p><p>DJIBOUTI OCTOBER 2, PARTLY PARALYZED.  MANY PEOPLE HAD </p><p>THOUGHT THAT BARKAT\'S LEAVING THE JOB WAS AN OPENING </p><p>FOR PROGRESS IN THE POWER-SHARING NEGOTIATIONS WITH </p><p>THE FRUD.  THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED WING OF THE </p><p>FRUD SIGNED A PEACE ACCORD FEBRUARY 7, 2000 THAT ENDED </p><p>SIX YEARS OF OCCASIONALLY VIOLENT CLASHES, AND HAVE </p><p>BEEN NEGOTIATING EVER SINCE.  THE ARMED WING OF THE </p><p>FRUD IS LED BY AHMED DINI AHMED WHO SERVED BRIEFLY AS </p><p>PRIME MINISTER JUST AFTER INDEPENDENCE.  THE </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS HAVE NOT BEEN GOING WELL LATELY, AND IT </p><p>WAS THOUGHT THAT THE PRIME MINISTERSHIP MIGHT BE A </p><p>BARGAINING CHIP WITH THE FRUD. </p><p> </p><p>5.  THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN SPENDING A LOT OF TIME OUT </p><p>OF THE COUNTRY RECENTLY.  HE HAS BEEN BACK IN DJIBOUTI </p><p>FOR ALMOST TWO WEEKS FOLLOWING TRIPS TO KHARTOUM AND </p><p>ASMARA, AND HE LEAVES FOR BEIJING IN THE NEXT COUPLE </p><p>OF DAYS.  THE PRESIDENT DECIDED NOT TO ATTEND THE </p><p>AFRICAN SUMMIT ON AFRICAN UNION IN SIRTE, LIBYA, </p><p>APPARENTLY PREFERRING TO WORK ON DOMESTIC POLITICS. </p><p>BECAUSE THE PRIME MINISTER\'S JOB IS LARGELY </p><p>CEREMONIAL, IT IS THOUGHT THAT THE PRESIDENT DID NOT </p><p>MISS THE SIRTE CONFERENCE JUST TO SELECT SOMEONE FOR </p><p>THIS ONE POSITION, AND MORE CABINET CHANGES WILL BE </p><p>MADE SOON.  HOWEVER, PREDICTING WHOLESALE CABINET </p><p>CHANGES HAS BEEN POPULAR SPORT EVER SINCE ISMAIL OMAR </p><p>GUELLEH CAME TO POWER IN APRIL 1999, YET THE ONLY </p><p>CHANGE HE HAS MADE SO FAR IS TO NAME A NEW PRIME </p><p>MINISTER. </p><p> </p><p>YAMAMOTO </p><p></p></div>
