WFP DEPUTY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR JEAN JACQUES GRAISSE LAID </p><p>OUT THE FOOD NEEDS FOR AFRICA OVER THE COMING MONTHS, </p><p>FOCUSING ON THE FOLLY OF REFUSING TO ACCEPT "COMPLETELY </p><p>SAFE" U.S. FOOD.  HE TERMED THIS "THE MOST ABSURD </p><p>SITUATION" HE HAD SEEN IN A CAREER OF RELIEF WORK. </p><p>AMBASSADOR HALL REVIEWED HIS RECENT MISSION TO AFRICA AND </p><p>URGED THE AMBASSADORS TO GET THEIR GOVERNMENTS TO STEP UP </p><p>THEIR ASSISTANCE LEVELS, BOTH OF COMMODITIES AND OF CASH. </p><p>HE UNDERSCORED THE MORAL ISSUES AT HAND, AND NOTED THAT HOW </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  06141  010934Z </p><p>POLITICAL LEADERS RESPOND -- BOTH IN FAMINE-STRUCK </p><p>COUNTRIES AND DONOR COUNTRIES, WILL BE HELD IN JUDGMENT BY </p><p>THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.

MOST OF THE </p><p>AMBASSADORS/CHARGES TOOK DETAILED NOTES, AND MANY INDICATED </p><p>THEY WOULD REPORT U.S. CONCERNS BACK TO CAPITALS.  WE HAVE </p><p>PRESSED AND WILL CONTINUE TO PRESS THE DEAN OF THE VATICAN </p><p>DIPLOMATIC CORPS (FROM SAN MARINO) TO MAKE THIS ISSUE A </p><p>THEME OF HIS ANNUAL GREETING TO THE POPE ON JANUARY 13. </p><p>THE POPE\'S RESPONSE, WHICH IS PICKED UP BY MEDIA ALL OVER </p><p>THE WORLD, COULD VERY WELL PROVIDE AMMUNITION TO USE WITH </p><p>BISHOPS CONFERENCES AND OTHER ELEMENTS OF THE CHURCH THAT </p><p>HAVE BEEN UNHELPFUL ON THE BIOTECH MESSAGE IN RECENT </p><p>MONTHS. </p><p>NICHOLSON </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> </p><p></p><p> 2002VATICA06141 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
