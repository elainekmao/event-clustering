<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 002120 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR SA/INS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11-12-12 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PREL, CE, LTTE - Peace Process, External Relations, Human Rights </p><p>SUBJECT:  Controversial journalist\'s visa extension </p><p>denied amidst speculation of LTTE and/or political </p><p>influence </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  (A) Reston VA dtg 110418Z NOV 02 </p><p> </p><p>-      (B) Reston VA dtg 110356Z NOV 02 </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador E. Ashley Wills.  Reasons </p><p>1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) SUMMARY:  GSL recently denied a visa extension </p><p>for Paul Harris, a UK national and a journalist loosely </p><p>affiliated with the "Daily Telegraph" in London.  The </p><p>British High Commission doubts that Harris will return </p><p>except perhaps to finalize some personal financial </p><p>matters.  Speculation in the press is that the denial </p><p>was based on political pressure because of Harris\' </p><p>criticism of the government and the Liberation Tigers of </p><p>Tamil Eelam (LTTE).  The President\'s office has alleged </p><p>that the visa denial amounts to suppression of freedom </p><p>of the press.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>Harris out, the President pounces </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) The visa case of Paul Harris, a UK national and </p><p>controversial journalist in Sri Lanka who is loosely </p><p>affiliated with the "Daily Telegraph" in London (and </p><p>writes for local publications), has created a minor </p><p>furor in the Sri Lankan press.  On November 8 Harris\' </p><p>visa to Sri Lanka expired.  Prior to the expiration of </p><p>the visa Harris had applied for an extension, which was </p><p>denied by the MFA.  Harris departed Sri Lanka to the </p><p>Maldives on November 8, with the stated intention of </p><p>reapplying for a visa. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The President\'s office issued a statement on </p><p>November 6 accusing the government of preventing freedom </p><p>of the press.  In part, it stated, "Freedom of </p><p>expression and the right of dissent are bedrock </p><p>requirements for a democratic and free society and this </p><p>insidious silencing of an often lone voice against the </p><p>conventional wisdom of the government is a serious </p><p>erosion of media freedom and (a) set back for democracy </p><p>in Sri Lanka."  The statement received widespread </p><p>coverage in the weekend press.  Presidential spokesman </p><p>Harim Peiris added that although Harris may have </p><p>technically broken the terms of his visa the decision to </p><p>enforce the rules on him was arbitrary.  Peiris averred </p><p>that one way the President may make her point that she </p><p>supports freedom of the press and show she is in control </p><p>is to grant Harris Sri Lankan citizenship.  Peiris </p><p>emphasized that no such decision has yet been made. </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>MFA holds firm </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Responding to media coverage that was critical </p><p>of the MFA\'s decision to deny a visa extension for </p><p>Harris, the MFA released a statement explaining its </p><p>decision.  The MFA charged Harris with violating the </p><p>terms of his original visa, saying it prohibited him </p><p>from engaging in any work other than as a journalist for </p><p>the "Daily Telegraph."  The statement specifically </p><p>commented on Harris\' writing regular columns for the </p><p>"Daily Mirror," a local English language daily that has </p><p>expressed some criticism of the government and the </p><p>current peace process.  (NOTE:  Harris\' columns have </p><p>been openly critical of the direction of Sri Lanka\'s </p><p>peace process.  Among other things, Harris wrote that </p><p>his predictions that the LTTE would use the ceasefire to </p><p>prepare for future conflict, particularly through </p><p>recruitment of children, have come true.  He also wrote </p><p>that the government is not doing enough to counter or to </p><p>even address this development.  END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Deputy British High Commissioner Peter Hughes, </p><p>commented that late last week he had urged Harris to </p><p>abide by Sri Lanka\'s laws and not overstay his visa. </p><p>Hughes does not believe the GSL will revisit the </p><p>decision to deny the visa extension.  Hughes stated that </p><p>he spoke to Foreign Secretary Nihal Rodrigo about the </p><p>issue and Rodrigo indicated that the decision not to </p><p>extend the visa had been made at the "highest level" and </p><p>there was no intention to review the issue.  Hughes </p><p>added that the MFA believes that the worst of the </p><p>negative publicity about the denial passed over the </p><p>weekend.  Hughes forewarned that Harris is only </p><p>scheduled to stay in the Maldives until November 14, </p><p>when he may try to stir up attention again.  Hughes </p><p>closed by saying Rodrigo had intimated that the GSL was </p><p>willing to work out a deal for Harris to return to Sri </p><p>Lanka so that he can finalize his personal financial </p><p>arrangements, but then only for a week. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>Media organizations object </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Multiple organizations associated with freedom </p><p>of the press have expressed their dissatisfaction with </p><p>the actions of the GSL on this matter.  The Editor\'s </p><p>Guild of Sri Lanka, the Free Media Movement (a local </p><p>NGO), and the Foreign Correspondents Association of Sri </p><p>Lanka have criticized the decision not to extend Harris\' </p><p>visa as an infringement on freedom of the press.  In </p><p>addition to accusations that the government is trying to </p><p>get rid of a critic, some articles claim that the LTTE </p><p>is applying pressure on the GSL to silence Harris </p><p>because of his criticism of the LTTE and the peace </p><p>process in general. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) The GSL clearly wants Harris out, and it may well </p><p>be for what he has written about the peace process </p><p>rather than for violating the terms of his visa.  The </p><p>President saw his case as a chance to attack the Prime </p><p>Minister and his government over the same kind of heavy- </p><p>handed tactics he has accused her of in the past.  In </p><p>doing so, she may have scored a few points.  Still, the </p><p>Prime Minister\'s conduct since his December 2001 </p><p>election has earned him a reputation for honesty and </p><p>moderation, and the Sri Lankan public seems willing to </p><p>give him the benefit of the doubt on Harris.  Mission </p><p>will watch closely to determine if this case is an </p><p>isolated incident or the beginning of a trend toward </p><p>suppression of the press by the GSL. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
