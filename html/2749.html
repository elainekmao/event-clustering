<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 000731 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p>NSC FOR MORIARTY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/11/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PTER, PGOV, PHUM, PREL, PINR, NP, Maoist Insurgency, U.S-Nepali Relations </p><p>SUBJECT: PM DEUBA ON THE CURRENT CRISIS: WORRIED, BUT </p><p>POSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. KATHMANDU 710 </p><p>     B. STATE 63807 </p><p>     C. KATHMANDU 708 </p><p>     D. KATHMANDU 672 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMBASSADOR MICHAEL E. MALINOWSKI, REASONS 1.5(B),(D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (S) Summary.  Prime Minister Deuba expressed gratitude for </p><p>international assistance to Nepal during an April 12 meeting </p><p>with U.S. and U.K. Ambassadors.  To continue recent "positive </p><p>steps," Deuba was hopeful that a White House meeting could be </p><p>arranged during his upcoming visit to the U.S.  Reviewing </p><p>developments overnight, Deuba confirmed a Maoist attack on </p><p>security forces in western Nepal and that India had </p><p>extradited eight suspected Maoists to Nepal.  Deuba hopes </p><p>India will "talk sense" to visiting former Prime Minister </p><p>Koirala, and added that he had not approved a meeting between </p><p>Koirala and Maoist representatives.  Deuba continues to worry </p><p>about efforts by Koirala to unseat him.  The PM enjoys good </p><p>relations with the King, who took pains to assure him of </p><p>Palace support for democracy.  Nepal\'s National Security </p><p>Council is now operational; next, Deuba hopes to </p><p>institutionalize ways of combating public corruption.  Post </p><p>concludes that high-profile exposure during Deuba\'s upcoming </p><p>trip to the U.S. will help him both fend off spoilers and </p><p>crystallize international support.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Deuba Grateful for Foreign Assistance </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Ambassador and UK Ambassador Ronald Nash breakfasted </p><p>with Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba at the British </p><p>residence April 12.  Reviewing the current situation in </p><p>Nepal, Deuba judged that "not all things are bad."  He </p><p>expressed great gratitude for the support he had received </p><p>from the U.S. and British governments, and specifically </p><p>acknowledged the presence in country of the U.S. military\'s </p><p>PACOM assessment team and a team from the U.S. National </p><p>Guard.  Deuba appreciated that Assistant Secretary Rocca had </p><p>included Nepal on the agenda in her recent talks in New </p><p>Delhi.  He also referred to helpful statements made by the </p><p>U.K. State Minister when he had come through Kathmandu </p><p>recently.  Nepal\'s Foreign Secretary had just concluded good </p><p>talks in Washington (Ref B) and London, and would travel to </p><p>Moscow in coming weeks.  The PM\'s own recent visit to Delhi </p><p>had gone well, he judged.  Prime Minister Deuba hopes he can </p><p>travel to Washington to meet with the President in May, with </p><p>the aim of building on what he termed "positive steps" in the </p><p>bilateral relationship and the struggle against terrorism </p><p>(Ref C). </p><p> </p><p>Maoists Continue Attacks, Target Infrastructure </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Deuba related that casualties would be high in an </p><p>April 11 series of attacks when Maoists overran two police </p><p>posts in western Nepal\'s Dang district (Septel).  Nepal\'s </p><p>security forces are stretched thin due to the need to guard </p><p>the country\'s infrastructure, which the Maoists continue to </p><p>attack, Deuba said. </p><p> </p><p>India Turns Over Maoists </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5. (S) Confirming press reports on India\'s hand-over of eight </p><p>wounded Maoists to Nepal, Deuba noted that the Indians had </p><p>acted on information provided by Kathmandu (Septel).  Deuba </p><p>described the Maoists as low-level.  (Note:  At a </p><p>U.S.-sponsored reception April 11, Chief of Army Staff Rana </p><p>also made this claim to Ambassador.)  (We note this is the </p><p>first such action on India\'s part, and may have been the </p><p>result of the series of U.S., U.K., and Nepalese visits to </p><p>New Delhi.) </p><p> </p><p>Koirala to India </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Deuba hopes the Indians can "talk some sense" into </p><p>former Prime Minister G.P. Koirala during Koirala\'s upcoming </p><p>visit to India (Ref A).  Asked by Ambassador about rumored </p><p>plans for a meeting in India between Koirala and Maoist </p><p>leader Baburam Bhattarai, Deuba replied that he had not </p><p>authorized talks between the former PM and the Maoists. </p><p>(Note:  COAS Rana told Ambassador April 11 that the Royal </p><p>Nepalese Army (RNA) had caught wind of plans for a </p><p>Koirala-Bhattarai meeting in India, and would have Koirala </p><p>under surveillance during his trip in order, presumably, to </p><p>discredit the former PM.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>Former PM\'s Shadow </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Deuba stated that G.P. Koirala continues to try to </p><p>oust him (Ref A).  Deuba is "quite worried" about this.  He </p><p>sees option in dissolving the government and calling for new </p><p>elections to give him six more months, at least.  The </p><p>Ambassadors asked the Prime Minister whether elections could </p><p>be held under current security conditions, pointed out the </p><p>added expense to an already-strapped treasury, and that an </p><p>election would further stretch Nepal\'s security assets. </p><p> </p><p>Opposition Aiming for 7-10 Split </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Deuba does not think the main opposition party, </p><p>CPN-UML, is working to unseat him at this time.  Rather, the </p><p>opposition seeks to fragment the ruling Nepali Congress Party </p><p>(NCP).  After Deuba was unseated by G.P. Koirala in 1997, </p><p>CNP-UML leader Madhav Nepal approached him about joining </p><p>forces.  Deuba had declined. </p><p> </p><p>Relations with King </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) The PM\'s visit to western Nepal with the King and the </p><p>COAS (Ref D) had been "positive" and had boosted morale, </p><p>Deuba said.  He added that his relations with the King are </p><p>good, though he understood that Koirala had problems with the </p><p>current King.  The King had assured Deuba that he supports </p><p>the present democratic system. </p><p> </p><p>Pending Security Measures </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Deuba told the Ambassadors he had called an all-party </p><p>meeting for April 15 to discuss ways of heading off the </p><p>upcoming general strike, or "bandh," scheduled for April </p><p>23-27.  He plans to hold political rallies and similar events </p><p>to get people into the streets.  The PM also pointed out that </p><p>Nepal\'s newly formed National Security Council had begun to </p><p>function.  One of the NSC\'s functions is to investigate human </p><p>rights abuses, he noted, and the head of the NSC himself will </p><p>handle the human rights portfolio. </p><p> </p><p>New Measure to Control Endemic Corruption </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) Asked about corruption in his administration, Deuba </p><p>stated that he knew that at least half of his cabinet members </p><p>were corrupt, but his government would fall if he moved to </p><p>get rid of them.  A survey of office-holders\' property was </p><p>underway; this would be used as a benchmark later on to see </p><p>who had acquired substantial property during their term of </p><p>office.  Deuba also noted that a new anti-corruption bill had </p><p>been passed by the lower house of Parliament.  (Note:  A vote </p><p>in the upper house could come as early as the evening of </p><p>April 12, the Parliament Secretariat told us.) </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) During breakfast, Deuba\'s obvious pleasure at growing </p><p>international support for Nepal and India\'s cooperation in </p><p>the return of the wounded Maoists was tempered by his </p><p>distress over the overnight attacks in western Nepal. </p><p>Although his position looks secure for now (Ref A), he faces </p><p>enormous challenges in the days to come.  Meetings at the </p><p>highest level in Washington will raise his standing both at </p><p>home and abroad and ensure a measure of continuity as Nepal </p><p>grapples with the increasingly menacing Maoist insurgency. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
