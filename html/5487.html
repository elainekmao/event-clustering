<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ISTANBUL 000149 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, TU, Istanbul </p><p>SUBJECT: PROTESTANTS TRY ADAPTIVE APPROACH TO CHURCH </p><p>ESTABLISHMENT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary: Seventeen nascent Protestant churches have </p><p>adopted a novel legal tactic designed to circumvent </p><p>regulations that for years have made it nearly impossible to </p><p>receive zoning approval for a church or prayer group.  The </p><p>success or failure of this strategy depends on the outcome of </p><p>the churches\' attempts to win legal recognition in a series </p><p>of ongoing court cases. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>In Legal Limbo </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Poloff recently met with Attorney Mustafa Demir, who </p><p>represents most of the American Protestant groups in </p><p>Istanbul, including a total of 22 churches and one </p><p>now-defunct school (Martyn International Academy).  In past </p><p>meetings, Demir and Amcit Protestant leader George Bristow </p><p>expressed their frustration at not being able to open a </p><p>church under Turkish law.  In fact, Demir said, there </p><p>is no provision in Turkish law, either positive or negative, </p><p>for the establishment of a new church.  Requests for a </p><p>building to be zoned as a church are typically ignored or </p><p>refused. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) For these reasons, Protestant groups often give up </p><p>trying to establish churches within any legal framework, </p><p>instead opting for informal arrangements, converting shops or </p><p>apartments into places of worship, and hoping that the </p><p>unregistered church will go unnoticed.  This approach </p><p>typically works for a time, but in a matter of months police </p><p>take notice, or neighbors complain, and the informal church </p><p>is shut down, the leaders often charged with zoning </p><p>violations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>The Mosque-like Approach </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Ironically, most Turkish mosques similarly inhabit a </p><p>legal no-man,s-land, in that they too usually lack zoning </p><p>permission.  Upon completion of a new mosque, the leadership </p><p>applies for benefits that, according to Turkish law, are </p><p>given to all religious institutions: free water, electricity, </p><p>gas, trash collection, and so forth. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Demir sees provision of these services as a means to </p><p>secure legal recognition without the zoning issue face-off. </p><p>He has advised his clients first to buy, lease, or renovate </p><p>the property they wish to use as a church.  Then, the church </p><p>requests provision of municipal services that all religious </p><p>institutions are entitled to.  Also, the church notifies the </p><p>local police that they have some security concerns, and </p><p>requests police protection.  Finally, if GoT authorities warn </p><p>the churches of their lack of a zoning permit, they file a </p><p>counter-suit asking for legal recognition from the state, </p><p>claiming that the utilities and police protection constitute </p><p>evidence of their recognized status in a manner similar to </p><p>any mosque. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) To date, 17 churches have initiated cases seeking </p><p>such legal recognition.  Of the 17, three have had initial </p><p>rulings: one finding in favor of the church, one against </p><p>(stating that the church was not a legal entity and thus </p><p>could not bring suit against the state), and one which has </p><p>been postponed for further examination.  Demir hopes that if </p><p>the one positive ruling stands on appeal, it can be used as </p><p>precedent to buttress the claims of the other churches. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>Under Another Umbrella </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) The same group of Istanbul Protestant churches had </p><p>previously run up against difficulties in running an </p><p>unregistered school, the Martyn International Academy (MIA). </p><p>Though the case is still pending, the board members of the </p><p>now-defunct school admitted to breaking Turkish law in the </p><p>operation of an unlicensed educational institution (see </p><p>reftel). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) In a similarly pragmatic manner, MIA has found a </p><p>means to re-open in another location on the Asian side of </p><p>Istanbul, under the auspices of the newly opened Istanbul </p><p>International School of Camlica.  The school has already been </p><p>registered, and the former MIA students and faculty have been </p><p>added on as the "English Language Section" of a school that </p><p>also offers instruction in Turkish and Korean.  200 former </p><p>MIA students have thus been able to attend classes under the </p><p>new school,s name. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) Comment: Having exhausted their earlier strategies </p><p>of normal application, and quiet evasion, Demir and Bristow </p><p>hope that their new "adaptation" strategy will prove more </p><p>fruitful.  Final resolution of the ongoing cases will soon </p><p>show whether or not their hopes are misplaced.  End Comment. </p><p>ARNETT </p><p></p></div>
