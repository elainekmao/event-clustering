<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 003870 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARN, NEA/PA, NEA/AIA, INR/NESA, R/MR, </p><p>I/GNEA, B/BXN, B/BRN, NEA/PPD, NEA/IPA FOR ALTERMAN </p><p>USAID/ANE/MEA </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH </p><p>PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p> </p><p>TAGS: KMDR JO </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON MIDDLE EAST </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                        Summary </p><p> </p><p>-- Lead stories in all papers today, June 29, focus on </p><p>the efforts to achieve a ceasefire by Palestinian </p><p>militant groups and National Security Advisor Rice\'s </p><p>arrival in the region to further the peace process.  A </p><p>number of editorial commentaries today discuss the </p><p>Palestinian factions agreement to a "truce". </p><p> </p><p>                 Editorial Commentary </p><p> </p><p>-- "A successful tactical move" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Mohammad Kawash writes on the back </p><p>page of independent, mass-appeal Arabic daily Al-Arab </p><p>Al-Yawm (06/29):  "The resistance factions did not </p><p>alter their strategies, nor did they retract their </p><p>objectives and their demands for a comprehensive </p><p>Israeli withdrawal and for the establishment of an </p><p>independent Palestinian state.  They are dealing with </p><p>the current dangerous events leniently, realistically </p><p>and sensibly..  The Palestinians are telling the </p><p>international community, as well as the Americans and </p><p>the Israelis, that the Palestinian people do not fight </p><p>for fighting\'s sake and do not go to war for war\'s </p><p>sake, but for their rights, their freedom, their </p><p>dignity and to achieve statehood.  The Palestinian </p><p>people, after all, want a normal and dignified life, </p><p>just like all people on this earth." </p><p> </p><p>-- "The truce is self-protecting and a first step </p><p>towards statehood" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Hamadeh Fara\'neh writes on the op-ed </p><p>page of semi-official, influential Arabic daily Al-Rai </p><p>(06/29):  "The American intervention is not a gift or </p><p>a grant given to the Palestinian people.  It is the </p><p>result of urgent demands by America\'s Arab friends </p><p>(Jordan, Egypt, Saudi and Morocco), of continuous </p><p>European pressure, and of the failure of Israeli </p><p>policy.  The American intervention came on the heels </p><p>of Palestinian sacrifices, their heroism and their </p><p>steadfastness.  We must, therefore, see the facts as </p><p>they are and not as we want them to be.  The truce is </p><p>not a conspiracy or a trick and accepting it on the </p><p>part of the Palestinians is not a sign of stupidity, </p><p>weakness or lack of ability.  It is, rather a </p><p>political tactic to reap the fruits of sacrifices and </p><p>a breath-catching station from which the battle for </p><p>independence continues even if it is by other tools. </p><p>The purpose is to eliminate the occupation and win </p><p>independence, not to fight.  Fighting, struggling and </p><p>sacrifices are the available means to achieve the </p><p>objective of independence, and the roadmap is the </p><p>internationally-provided program to put an end to the </p><p>occupation and achieve an independent state." </p><p> </p><p>-- "A truce to cross this period" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Jamil Nimri writes on the back page of </p><p>independent, mass-appeal Arabic daily Al-Arab Al-Yawm </p><p>(06/29):  "The Palestinian factions succeeded in </p><p>achieving a truce.  It is now up to the U.S. </p><p>administration and how much it wants to impose this </p><p>truce and stop the bloodbath.  Hamas\' and (Palestinian </p><p>Islamic) Jihad\'s agreement on the truce prevents Rice </p><p>and others to make war on Hamas the top item of the </p><p>agenda..  It is the right of any Palestinian to wonder </p><p>what happens next and whether all their sacrifices </p><p>over the past two years of the Intifada have been for </p><p>only this truce.  Unfortunately, for the time being, </p><p>the answer is yes.  This is because the current </p><p>international and regional climate does not offer any </p><p>political reward for military action..  Since </p><p>September 11, 2001, when Al-Qa\'eda operations came in </p><p>the same form as the Palestinian suicide bombings, all </p><p>the blame has been put on the Palestinian side, while </p><p>Israeli operations were viewed as self-defense..  The </p><p>world, which has never stopped acknowledging the </p><p>righteousness of the Palestinian cause, is now dealing </p><p>with only one priority, namely to stop the violence in </p><p>order to resume the peace process.  Therefore, for the </p><p>Palestinian side to appear as the party that does not </p><p>want to stop the violence would actually cover up </p><p>Israel\'s denial of Palestinian rights and its </p><p>continuance of the brutal campaign against the </p><p>Palestinian people.  In other words, armed struggle is </p><p>no longer giving Palestinians any privileges, rather </p><p>(it is giving them) only more material and political </p><p>losses." </p><p>-- "The ball is in the Israeli and American court" </p><p>Center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(06/29) editorializes:  "The atmosphere of openness </p><p>that prevails in the Palestinian political arena </p><p>brings much reassurance to those peace-loving forces </p><p>in the region and in the world.  The Palestinians are </p><p>proving, for the umpteenth time, that they are more </p><p>concerned to push the peace process forward and that </p><p>they are more willing to abide by their commitments.. </p><p>Washington, which has adopted policies that are </p><p>blindly biased in favor of the Hebrew state, finds </p><p>itself now face to face with the international </p><p>community, and must therefore bring something new to </p><p>the Arab-Israeli conflict.  It is no longer reasonable </p><p>or acceptable for the U.S. administration to continue </p><p>its crazy war against the so-called `Palestinian </p><p>terrorism\' when Israel\'s aggressiveness goes on </p><p>without any reins, wreaking death and destruction </p><p>among the Palestinians.  It is no longer acceptable </p><p>for Washington to continue its policy of covering up </p><p>for the occupation\'s actions and crimes..  The ball is </p><p>now in the American court.  Washington alone, as it </p><p>claims sponsorship for the peace process and for the </p><p>initiative of two states for two peoples, can </p><p>translate these initiatives and visions and force the </p><p>forces of occupation and racism to backtrack." </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
