<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L RANGOON 001567 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV, EB/IDF, AND IO/EDA </p><p>COMMERCE FOR ITA JEAN KELLY </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA JEFF NEIL </p><p>CINCPAC FOR FPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/08/2007 </p><p>TAGS: EAID, ECON, BM, UNDP, Economy </p><p>SUBJECT: RAZALI HEARS THE SAME TUNE ON ECONOMY, UNDP </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. RANGOON 1479 </p><p> </p><p>     B. RANGOON 1219 </p><p>     C. RANGOON 1068 </p><p>     D. RANGOON 1069 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: COM CARMEN MARTINEZ FOR REASONS 1.5 (B,D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: UN Special Envoy for Burma Razali Ismail, </p><p>during his November visit to Rangoon, paid a call on the </p><p>SPDC\'s Minister for National Planning and Economic </p><p>Development, and focal point for SPDC-UN relations, U Soe </p><p>Tha.  As he did during Razali\'s previous visit in August, the </p><p>Minister played Razali the same unbelievable tune: touting </p><p>the country\'s economic progress, explaining the necessity of </p><p>GOB "involvement" in UNDP programs, and justifying limiting </p><p>Aung San Suu Kyi\'s access to UN project sites.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Post has recently obtained an official GOB readout of </p><p>the meeting between the SPDC\'s economic planning czar U Soe </p><p>Tha (the GOB focal point for UNDP and UNICEF projects in </p><p>Burma) and Razali when he visited Rangoon in mid-November. </p><p>During the brief meeting, Razali asked U Soe Tha about the </p><p>sagging Burmese economy and for a progress report on the </p><p>projects proposed by the UNDP for the fourth iteration of its </p><p>Human Development Initiative (HDI-IV). </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) On the economy, U Soe Tha repeated almost verbatim his </p><p>message from August, citing purported year-on-year double </p><p>digit GDP growth rates thus far in FY 2002-03, an increase in </p><p>exports resulting in a trade surplus, and an "improving" </p><p>budgetary situation.  He did admit that inflation was </p><p>"slightly high," but said that "necessary measures" were </p><p>being taken to reduce the inflation rate. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) On the UNDP\'s HDI-IV projects, U Soe Tha told Razali </p><p>that 6 of 7 proposed projects would likely get underway </p><p>sometime this month.  However, it is unclear whether these </p><p>projects have actually been approved by the cabinet, or just </p><p>by "concerned ministries."  We also understand that the </p><p>UNDP\'s planned agricultural sector review has gotten the nod. </p><p> On a less encouraging note, the Minister repeated his August </p><p>warning to Razali that "the GOB will be more involved in the </p><p>HDI-IV than it was in the HDI-III."  Once again, though, the </p><p>Minister did not flesh out the details of this planned </p><p>"involvement." </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) As he did in August, Razali expressed his concern that </p><p>ASSK be allowed to visit and study HDI-IV program sites.  U </p><p>Soe Tha was unmoved, though, repeating his earlier reply that </p><p>government approval was necessary if any "outsider" wished to </p><p>study projects sites that were "the responsibility of </p><p>government organizations." </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Comment: Razali did not push U Soe Tha on the economy </p><p>as much as in August, leading us to think that the Envoy is </p><p>realizing that debating the finer points of economic reform </p><p>with the witless Minster is a fool\'s errand.  The regime is </p><p>claiming that it is removing obstacles to the UNDP\'s HDI-IV </p><p>programs.  However, UNDP tells us that progress on this front </p><p>has in fact been quite limited.  Likewise, the repeated, but </p><p>vague, threat of increased government attention to UNDP </p><p>projects and the apparent continued official reluctance to </p><p>allow ASSK access to aid project sites are of concern.  End </p><p>comment. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
