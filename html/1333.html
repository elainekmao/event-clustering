<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 TASHKENT 004223 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/02/10 </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, PTER, RU, AF, UZ </p><p>SUBJECT:  KARIMOV URGES CLOSER COOPERATION WITH U.S., COMMITS TO </p><p>FRANK AIRING OF DIFFERENCES </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMB JOHN E. HERBST, REASONS:  1.5 (B,D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY:  ON NOVEMBER 1, THE AMBASSADOR PRESENTED </p><p>CREDENTIALS TO PRESIDENT KARIMOV.  THIS WAS FOLLOWED BY A </p><p>SPIRITED DISCUSSION OF ABOUT ONE HOUR DURING WHICH KARIMOV </p><p>ARGUED FOR DEEPER COOPERATION WITH THE U.S., CHARGED RUSSIA WITH </p><p>MANEUVERING TO RESTORE HEGEMONY IN CENTRAL ASIA, AND OUTLINED </p><p>THE STRATEGY OF UZBEKISTAN (AND CIS FRIENDS UKRAINE AND GEORGIA) </p><p>TO FOIL RUSSIAN DESIGNS.  KARIMOV REITERATED HIS FAMILIAR </p><p>ARGUMENT ABOUT UZBEKISTAN\'S CENTRALITY TO THE ISLAMIC WORLD AND </p><p>VALUE AS A PARTNER TO THE UNITED STATES.  HE CONCLUDED BY </p><p>STATING UZBEKISTAN\'S WILLINGNESS TO RESPOND TO OUR CRITICISMS ON </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS AND OTHER ISSUES.  HE SEEMED, HOWEVER, TO RELEGATE </p><p>THE HARD OR CONTENTIOUS ISSUES TO FOREIGN MINISTER KAMILOV.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  AMBASSADOR HERBST PRESENTED HIS CREDENTIALS TO PRESIDENT </p><p>ISLOM KARIMOV ON NOVEMBER 1.  THE MEETING WHICH FOLLOWED WAS </p><p>ALSO ATTENDED BY FORMIN KAMILOV AND DCM (NOTETAKER).  PRESIDENT </p><p>KARIMOV THANKED THE AMBASSADOR FOR HAVING SPOKEN TO THE PRESS IN </p><p>UZBEK ON HIS ARRIVAL IN TASHKENT ON SATURDAY, OCTOBER 28.  THIS </p><p>GESTURE HAD SIGNIFIED THE RESPECT AND ESTEEM OF THE UNITED </p><p>STATES FOR UZBEKISTAN AND ITS PEOPLE.  RELATIONS WITH THE UNITED </p><p>STATES WERE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT.  UZBEKISTAN APPRECIATED THE </p><p>MATERIAL HELP IT RECEIVES FROM THE U.S. AND, ABOVE ALL, THE </p><p>ATTENTION UZBEKISTAN RECEIVES FROM SENIOR U.S. POLICY-MAKERS. </p><p>NO COUNTRY COULD UNDERTAKE DEMOCRATIC AND ECONOMIC REFORMS </p><p>WITHOUT HELP.  HE SALUTED THE EFFORTS OF THE UNITED STATES AND </p><p>EUROPE IN TRAINING THE NEXT GENERATION OF LEADERS.  THESE </p><p>EFFORTS WERE LAYING THE BASIS FOR PROGRESS ON DEMOCRATIC AND </p><p>ECONOMIC REFORMS. </p><p> </p><p>GROWING U.S. - UZBEKISTAN COOPERATION </p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) RELATIONS BETWEEN THE U.S. AND UZBEKISTAN HAD GONE </p><p>THROUGH VARIOUS PHASES IN THEIR SHORT HISTORY, KARIMOV OBSERVED. </p><p>THE VISIT OF SECRETARY ALBRIGHT IN APRIL HAD BEEN A </p><p>BREAKTHROUGH.  IN HER THREE DAYS IN UZBEKISTAN, SHE DID MORE </p><p>THAN MEET OFFICIALS.  SHE ACTUALLY GOT A FLAVOR FOR THE PEOPLE </p><p>AND THEIR CULTURE.  HUMAN CONTACTS WERE VERY IMPORTANT.  WHEN </p><p>KARIMOV MET HER IN NEW YORK AT THE MILLENNIUM SUMMIT, SECRETARY </p><p>ALBRIGHT HAD ACKNOWLEDGED THAT HER VISIT HAD GIVEN HER MUCH TO </p><p>REFLECT UPON.  THE VISIT HAD SHAPED HER OPINIONS ON UZBEKISTAN </p><p>AND THE REGION. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) KARIMOV NOTED THAT UZBEKISTAN\'S POSITIONS ON </p><p>INTERNATIONAL ISSUES - FOR EXAMPLE WITHIN THE U.N. FRAMEWORK - </p><p>OFTEN WERE IDENTICAL TO THOSE OF THE UNITED STATES.  THIS WAS </p><p>NOT BECAUSE UZBEKISTAN SOUGHT TO CURRY FAVOR WITH US.  IT WAS </p><p>BECAUSE UZBEKISTAN, ACTING IN PURSUIT OF ITS OWN INTERESTS, </p><p>USUALLY FOUND ITSELF IN AGREEMENT WITH THE U.S.  UZBEKISTAN </p><p>AGREED WITH THE U.S. MORE OFTEN THAN UZBEKISTAN\'S NEIGHBORS DID, </p><p>INDEED MORE OFTEN THAN MOST COUNTRIES.  UNLIKE SOME OF THEM, </p><p>UZBEKISTAN DID NOT SHIFT ITS POSITIONS DEPENDING ON SOME PETTY </p><p>CALCULATIONS.  KAZAKHSTAN, FOR EXAMPLE, WAS PRO-U.S. ON A </p><p>QUESTION ONE DAY AND OPPOSED THE U.S. THE NEXT. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) A CLEAR ILLUSTRATION OF UZBEKISTAN\'S CLOSENESS TO THE </p><p>U.S. ON KEY ISSUES WAS THE MIDDLE EAST, KARIMOV CONTINUED. </p><p>ISRAELI POLITICAL LEADER NATAN SCHARANSKY HAD RECENTLY COME TO </p><p>TASHKENT ON ONE OF HIS FREQUENT VISITS AND HAD MET KARIMOV. </p><p>KARIMOV AND HE HAD AGREED THAT COUNTRIES NOT DIRECTLY INVOLVED </p><p>IN THE PEACE PROCESS WERE GLAD TO SEE IT FALTER.  OTHER </p><p>"FANATIC" COUNTRIES WERE DELIBERATELY INFLAMING THE SITUATION. </p><p>THOSE THAT WERE COMPLACENT IN THE FACE OF THE WORSENING </p><p>SITUATION DID NOT CONSIDER THE DANGEROUS CONSEQUENCES FOR </p><p>THEMSELVES.  NOTING PRESIDENT PUTIN WAS NOW ON AN OFFICIAL VISIT </p><p>TO PARIS, KARIMOV SAID PUTIN AND THE FRENCH WERE PRESSING TO </p><p>OPEN THE PEACE PROCESS TO THEIR PARTICIPATION.  THE U.S. WAS </p><p>RIGHT TO RESIST THESE EFFORTS.  RUSSIA HAD NO RESOURCES TO OFFER </p><p>AND THEREFORE COULD NOT CONTRIBUTE TO MIDDLE EAST PEACE. </p><p>RADICAL FORCES WERE ALSO AT WORK IN AFGHANISTAN AND PAKISTAN, </p><p>KARIMOV NOTED.  THE GOU WORKED CLOSELY WITH THE U.S. ON </p><p>AFGHANISTAN THROUGH AMB SAFAYEV\'S MEETINGS WITH A/S INDERFURTH. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) ON THE ECONOMIC FRONT, KARIMOV NOTED HIS OWN GOOD </p><p>RELATIONS WITH USEXIM AND USEXIM PRESIDENT HARMAN.  U.S. </p><p>TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WAS ALSO VERY WELCOME.  HE CITED THE CASI </p><p>BORDER SECURITY PROGRAM AS AN INSTANCE OF THIS. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) THE VISIT OF NEWLY-APPOINTED DEFMIN GULAMOV TO THE U.S. </p><p>SHOWED OUR INCREASING CLOSENESS ON SECURITY ISSUES, KARIMOV </p><p>SAID.  GULAMOV WAS BEING RECEIVED AT A SENIOR LEVEL THROUGHOUT </p><p>THE ADMINISTRATION.  UZBEKISTAN WAS UNDERTAKING DEEP MILITARY </p><p>REFORMS AND HAD THE FIRST CIVILIAN DEFMIN IN THE CIS.  KARIMOV </p><p>KNEW AND RESPECTED GULAMOV AS A SCIENTIST.  THE RUSSIANS WOULD </p><p>MUCH PREFER TO DEAL WITH A GENERAL AS DEFMIN, SINCE GENERALS </p><p>TYPICALLY HAD BEEN TRAINED IN SOVIET MILITARY INSTITUTIONS. </p><p>GULAMOV, BY CONTRAST, WAS MODERN AND ENLIGHTENED.  KARIMOV DID </p><p>NOT WANT TO SEE THE MILITARY MEDDLE IN POLITICS OR TAKE PUBLIC </p><p>POSITIONS ON POLITICAL ISSUES AS IN RUSSIA. </p><p> </p><p>VIEWS ON THE NIS -- THE RUSSIANS ARE SCHEMING </p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) WITHIN THE CIS, UZBEKISTAN, GEORGIA, UKRAINE AND </p><p>SOMETIMES AZERBAIJAN HAD COMMON POSITIONS, SAID KARIMOV.  TO THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR\'S QUERY ABOUT MOLDOVA, KARIMOV REPLIED THAT LUSINCHI </p><p>WAS WEAK AND WOBBLY.  UZBEKISTAN AND ITS FRIENDS IN THE CIS WERE </p><p>COMMITTED TO A CIS OF INDEPENDENT, SOVEREIGN COUNTRIES AND </p><p>OPPOSED TO RUSSIAN ATTEMPTS TO DOMINATE THE OTHERS. </p><p>THE FOUR WANTED THE CIS TO FOCUS MAINLY ON BUILDING ECONOMIC </p><p>LINKS SUCH AS TRADE AND INVESTMENT.  IN AN INTERVIEW JUST </p><p>PUBLISHED IN THE FRENCH NEWSPAPER FIGARO, PUTIN HAD SAID RUSSIAN </p><p>FOREIGN POLICY DID NOT SEEK TO DOMINATE OTHERS.  THIS WAS NOT </p><p>TRUE.  ONE ONLY HAS TO LOOK, FOR EXAMPLE, AT HOW RUSSIA WAS </p><p>USING NATURAL GAS SALES AND TRANSPORT AS LEVERAGE OVER UKRAINE </p><p>AND TURKMENISTAN. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C)  THE EURASIAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY RECENTLY LAUNCHED IN </p><p>ASTANA BY RUSSIA, KAZAKHSTAN, BELARUS, KYRGYZSTAN AND TAJIKISTAN </p><p>SHOWED, KARIMOV ARGUED, THAT RUSSIA WAS GIVING UP ON THE CIS, </p><p>BECAUSE IT COULD NOT IMPOSE ITS WILL ON ALL.  RUSSIA WAS PUSHING </p><p>INSTEAD FOR A CLOSER, RUSSIA-DOMINATED SUBGROUP OF CIS </p><p>COUNTRIES.  ON THE SECURITY FRONT, RUSSIA WAS PUSHING A PARALLEL </p><p>INITIATIVE WITH THE MEMBERS OF THE CIS SECURITY TREATY.  RUSSIA </p><p>HOPED THAT THE OTHER CIS MEMBERS WOULD ULTIMATELY BE ATTRACTED </p><p>TO JOIN THESE SUB-GROUPS, WITH THE END RESULT BEING SOMETHING </p><p>LIKE THE USSR.  PUTIN WAS NOT DIFFERENT FROM YELTSIN, BUT MERELY </p><p>MORE AGGRESSIVE AND MORE FOCUSSED AROUND THE AGENDA OF RESTORING </p><p>RUSSIA\'S GREAT POWER STATUS. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) THE AMBASSADOR ASKED HOW UZBEKISTAN\'S RELATIONS WITH </p><p>RUSSIA AND PUTIN HAD EVOLVED SINCE THE LATTER\'S VISIT SOON AFTER </p><p>HIS ELECTION.  KARIMOV NOTED THAT PUTIN\'S FIRST VISIT HAD BEEN </p><p>AS PRIME MINISTER.  HE WAS SENT BY YELTSIN TO PERSUADE KARIMOV </p><p>TO COME TO MOSCOW FOR TALKS.  YELTSIN HAD TRIED HARD FOR A LONG </p><p>TIME TO BRING KARIMOV AND SHEVARDNADZE BACK UNDER MOSCOW\'S WING. </p><p>HE AND SHEVARDNADZE WERE DETERMINED NOT TO DO SO.  ALIYEV, </p><p>HOWEVER, WAS NOT SO FIRMLY SET ON MAINTAINING HIS DISTANCE FROM </p><p>THE RUSSIANS.  KARIMOV JUDGED HIM TO BE CAPABLE OF SWITCHING </p><p>CAMPS AT SOME POINT.  UNLIKE SHEVARDNADZE, ALIYEV WAS NOT DRIVEN </p><p>BY CONVICTION, ONLY TACTICAL ADVANTAGE.  INCIDENTALLY, NIYAZOV </p><p>WAS COMPLETELY UNRELIABLE AS A PARTNER FOR ANYONE.  HE HAD TRIED </p><p>TO USE TURKMENISTAN\'S NATURAL GAS TO BLACKMAIL VARIOUS PARTNERS </p><p>AND HAD BEEN SHOWN UP AS NOT SERIOUS. </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) ONCE PUTIN HAD BECOME PRESIDENT, HE HAD RENEWED HIS </p><p>ATTEMPTS TO BRING KARIMOV BACK INTO THE FOLD, KARIMOV CONTINUED. </p><p>RUSSIA CONSIDERED UZBEKISTAN TO BE A GATEWAY TO THE ARAB AND </p><p>MUSLIM WORLD.  WITH ITS HOLY SITES AND THE CONTRIBUTION OF NOTED </p><p>ISLAMIC SCHOLARS FROM UZBEKISTAN\'S HISTORY, UZBEKISTAN HAD TO BE </p><p>CONSIDERED CENTRAL TO THE ISLAMIC WORLD.  ISLAMIC PHILOSOPHY AND </p><p>LEARNING OWED MUCH TO UZBEKISTAN AND WAS NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH </p><p>WAHHABISM AND OTHER DEBASED IDEOLOGIES.  FRIENDSHIP WITH </p><p>UZBEKISTAN SHOULD BE IMPORTANT TO THE U.S. FOR THE SAME REASON - </p><p>TO BUILD BRIDGES TO THE ISLAMIC WORLD.  THE \'FANATICS\' WANTED </p><p>POWER IN UZBEKISTAN PRECISELY BECAUSE THEY RECOGNIZE THE </p><p>COUNTRY\'S IMPORTANCE IN ISLAMIC TRADITION.  THE LEADER OF </p><p>ISLAMIC COMMUNITIES IN THE UNITED STATES COMPLETELY SHARED </p><p>KARIMOV\'S VIEWS ON THIS MATTER.  RUSSIA UNDERSTOOD; THE U.S. </p><p>SHOULD TOO. </p><p> </p><p>AFGHANISTAN - TREADING LIGHTLY </p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) TURNING TO AFGHANISTAN, KARIMOV NOTED THE RECENT TALIBAN </p><p>VICTORIES AND MASOOD REVERSES.  THE RUSSIAN MEDIA HAD BEEN </p><p>EXAGGERATING THE DANGER OF A TALIBAN VICTORY FOR CENTRAL ASIAN </p><p>SECURITY.  THEY HAD DEPICTED A TASHKENT "SURROUNDED BY </p><p>WAHHABITES."  THE TALIBAN WERE SUPPOSEDLY MASSING FORCES ON THE </p><p>OTHER SIDE OF THE BORDER FROM TERMEZ AND ACQUIRING BOATS TO </p><p>INFILTRATE ACROSS THE AMU DARYA.  ALL OF THIS WAS PUBLISHED </p><p>DELIBERATELY TO SOW PANIC AMONG UZBEKISTAN\'S PEOPLE.  THE </p><p>RUSSIANS HOPED THAT THE PEOPLE WOULD PRESSURE KARIMOV TO ASK FOR </p><p>MILITARY HELP FROM RUSSIA.  RUSSIA HAD TRIED TO PROVOKE A "SMALL </p><p>BORDER WAR" BETWEEN UZBEKISTAN AND THE TALIBAN IN ORDER TO FORCE </p><p>THE GOU TO ACCEPT RUSSIAN MILITARY HELP.  THE AMBASSADOR ASKED </p><p>HOW RUSSIA COULD ACCOMPLISH THIS.  WAS KARIMOV SUGGESTING RUSSIA </p><p>SUPPORTED THE TALIBAN MATERIALLY?  KARIMOV ANSWERED NO. </p><p>RUSSIA\'S TACTICS WERE FOR EXAMPLE THE ISSUANCE OF PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>ADVISER YASTRZEMBSKIY\'S PUBLIC THREATS IN MAY OF RUSSIAN AIR </p><p>STRIKES ON TERRORIST BASES IN AFGHANISTAN.  THIS WAS INTENDED TO </p><p>PROVOKE THE TALIBAN TO ATTACK UZBEKISTAN (WHICH WOULD HAVE TO </p><p>ALLOW ITS AIRSPACE TO BE USED UNDER SUCH A SCENARIO).  RUSSIA </p><p>WAS MANEUVERING TO SET THE TALIBAN AGAINST UZBEKISTAN.  RUSSIA </p><p>HAD REINFORCED ITS SECURITY AND OTHER COOPERATION WITH </p><p>KYRGYZSTAN, KAZAKHSTAN AND TAJIKISTAN.  THIS WAS OF LITTLE USE </p><p>TO RUSSIA SO LONG AS UZBEKISTAN REFUSED TO PLAY.  RUSSIA ALSO </p><p>WAS BUILDING UP THE TALIBAN THREAT IN ORDER TO DIVERT </p><p>INTERNATIONAL ATTENTION FROM ITS DOINGS IN CHECHNYA.  UZBEKISTAN </p><p>WANTS NORMAL RELATIONS WITH RUSSIA, RELATIONS OF TWO STATES ON </p><p>AN EQUAL FOOTING, KARIMOV CONCLUDED.  THE RUSSIANS\' GOAL WAS </p><p>MILITARY BASES, WHICH KARIMOV WOULD NEVER ALLOW. </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) AS TO THE GOU\'S RECENT CONTACTS WITH THE TALIBAN, </p><p>KARIMOV SAID UZBEKISTAN DID NOT EXPECT TO FIND COMMON GROUND </p><p>WITH THESE RADICAL, FANATICAL IDEOLOGUES.  KARIMOV KNEW AND HAD </p><p>TOLD GENERAL MUSHARRAF ABOUT UZBEKISTAN\'S KNOWLEDGE OF TALIBAN </p><p>SUPPORT FOR TERRORISM AND INVOLVEMENT IN DRUG TRAFFICKING. </p><p>NEVERTHELESS, UZBEKISTAN WANTED TO AVOID NEEDLESSLY PROVOKING </p><p>CONFLICT WITH THE TALIBAN.  EVEN IF THE TALIBAN MANAGED TO TAKE </p><p>OVER THE WHOLE TERRITORY OF AFGHANISTAN, THEY WOULD NOT BE ABLE </p><p>TO GOVERN IT.  THE MOVEMENT WOULD SPLINTER AND NEW FIGHTING </p><p>WOULD START.  THE ONLY HOPE FOR A LASTING SETTLEMENT WAS AN </p><p>INCLUSIVE GOVERNMENT ENCOMPASSING MANY DIFFERENT POLITICAL </p><p>FORCES.  UZBEKISTAN SUPPORTED THE INITIATIVE OF THE FORMER KING </p><p>OF AFGHANISTAN.  HIS REPRESENTATIVE WOULD VISIT TASHKENT LATER </p><p>THIS MONTH. </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) THE AMBASSADOR TOLD KARIMOV THE U.S. IS COMMITTED TO </p><p>DEEPENING OUR COOPERATION WITH UZBEKISTAN ACROSS MANY FRONTS. </p><p>HE WAS IMPRESSED BY THE RANGE OF AREAS WHERE WE WERE ALREADY </p><p>WORKING TOGETHER.  THE UNITED STATES EMBASSY WOULD SURELY EXPAND </p><p>AND NEEDED THE COOPERATION OF THE GOU IN LOCATING SUITABLE </p><p>PROPERTY FOR CONSTRUCTION OF A NEW EMBASSY.  KARIMOV INDICATED </p><p>HIS SUPPORT.  THE AMBASSADOR NOTED AGAIN THAT WE NEEDED TO BUILD </p><p>OUR COOPERATION ACROSS ALL FRONTS, WHICH INCLUDED NOT ONLY </p><p>SECURITY BUT POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC AREAS. </p><p> </p><p>15. (C) PICKING UP THE AMBASSADOR\'S HINT, KARIMOV SAID HE HAD </p><p>DELIBERATELY DISCUSSED ONLY THE AREAS WHERE THE GOU AND U.S. </p><p>VIEWS WERE IN ACCORD.  NEXT TIME THE TWO SHOULD ADDRESS THOSE </p><p>AREAS WHERE THE GOU AND THE U.S. DID NOT SEE EYE TO EYE.  HE </p><p>KNEW WE HAD CONTACTS WITH SO-CALLED OPPOSITION FIGURES.  SOME OF </p><p>THEM WERE NOT GENUINE OPPOSITION FIGURES BUT INSANE (BOLNOY). </p><p>AFTER THE AMBASSADOR HAD BEGUN TO FORM HIS OWN DIRECT </p><p>IMPRESSIONS OF THESE MATTERS, HE WOULD BE GLAD TO OPEN A DIRECT, </p><p>FRANK EXCHANGE ON THEM.  FOR NOW, HE WOULD ONLY SAY THAT THE </p><p>U.S. SHOULD APPLY AN APPROPRIATE STANDARD WHEN JUDGING </p><p>UZBEKISTAN\'S PERFORMANCE.  THE STATE DEPARTMENT\'S DEMANDS WERE </p><p>NOT ALWAYS REASONABLE, BUT THE GOU WAS OPEN TO DISCUSSING THEM. </p><p>THE AMBASSADOR INDICATED WILLINGNESS TO ENGAGE WITH THE </p><p>PRESIDENT ON THESE ISSUES, AT WHICH POINT KARIMOV GESTURED TO </p><p>FORMIN KAMILOV, SAYING THE AMBASSADOR SHOULD DISCUSS THESE </p><p>MATTERS WITH KAMILOV. </p><p> </p><p>16. (C) COMMENT:  THIS WAS A GOOD FIRST MEETING WITH KARIMOV. </p><p>HE WAS SPONTANEOUS AND ALLOWED HIMSELF TO BE DRAWN AWAY FROM HIS </p><p>SCRIPT.  WE ARE INTRIGUED BY HIS SUGGESTION THAT, AFTER THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR HAD BEEN HERE A LITTLE WHILE, WE SHOULD DISCUSS THE </p><p>DIFFICULT INTERNAL POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC ISSUES.  BUT KARIMOV\'S </p><p>PROMPT REJOINDER THAT THE AMBASSADOR SHOULD TAKE THESE ISSUES UP </p><p>WITH KAMILOV MAY MEAN THAT KARIMOV PREFERS TO AVOID THEM. </p><p> </p><p>HERBST </p><p></p></div>
