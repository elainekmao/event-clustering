REASONS: 1.5 (B), (D </p><p>) </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  03962  130928Z </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY:  HOLY SEE CHINA DESK OFFICER, MONSIGNOR </p><p>GIANFRANCO ROTA-GRAZIOSI WELCOMED AMBASSADOR AT LARGE FOR </p><p>INTERNATIONAL RELIGIOUS FREEDOM HANFORD\'S EFFORTS TO </p><p>ENCOURAGE CHINA TO OPEN A DIALOGUE WITH THE HOLY SEE, BUT </p><p>EXPECTS LITTLE PROGRESS UNTIL AFTER THE LEADERSHIP PICTURE IS </p><p>CLEARER FOLLOWING THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY\'S CONFERENCE </p><p>THIS FALL.  HE DESCRIBED THE CHINESE SUGGESTION THAT THE </p><p>VATICAN\'S LACK OF CLARITY ON TAIWAN WAS THE BIGGEST OBSTACLE </p><p>TO PROGRESS AS A SMOKESCREEN FOR THE PRC\'S OWN INDECISION, </p><p>SINCE THE VATICAN HAD REPEATEDLY MADE CLEAR ITS WILLINGNESS </p><p>TO MOVE ITS EMBASSY TO BEIJING.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) DCM AND ACTING POLCHIEF MET AUGUST 12 WITH HOLY SEE </p><p>CHINA DESK OFFICER ROTA-GRAZIOSI TO REVIEW THE OUTCOME OF </p><p>AMBASSADOR HANFORD\'S AUGUST 5 VISIT TO CHINA (REFTELS) AND </p><p>DISCUSS POTENTIAL AREAS OF PROGRESS IN THE RUN-UP TO THE </p><p>PRESIDENT\'S OCTOBER MEETING WITH PRESIDENT JIANG.  DCM </p><p>OBSERVED THAT AMBASSADOR HANFORD WAS SEEKING TO BUILD A </p><p>DIALOGUE WITH OFFICIALS RESPONSIBLE FOR RELIGIOUS FREEDOM </p><p>ISSUES AND TO IDENTIFY SPECIFIC AREAS WHERE PROGRESS MAY BE </p><p>POSSIBLE, INCLUDING RESUMPTION OF A DIALOGUE WITH THE </p><p>VATICAN, CHANGES IN RELIGIOUS REGISTRATION LAWS, AND THE </p><p>PROVISION OF RELIGIOUS EDUCATION TO CHILDREN. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) ON OPENING OF A DIALOGUE WITH THE VATICAN, DCM NOTED </p><p>THE PRC OFFICIALS\' ASSERTION THAT THEY WANTED TO NORMALIZE </p><p>RELATIONS WITH THE VATICAN, IF ONLY THE VATICAN COULD CLARIFY </p><p>ITS RELATIONS WITH TAIWAN.  ROTA-GRAZIOSI SAW THIS AS A </p><p>DELAYING TACTIC TO MASK THE CHINESE OWN UNCERTAINTY OVER HOW </p><p>TO PROCEED ON RELIGIOUS ISSUES, AN UNCERTAINTY COMPOUNDED BY </p><p>THE UPCOMING COMMUNIST PARTY LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE.  HE NOTED </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  03962  130928Z </p><p>THAT SECRETARY OF STATE SODANO HAS TWICE MADE EXPLICIT THE </p><p>HOLY SEE\'S WILLINGNESS TO MOVE ITS EMBASSY TO BEIJING </p><p>"TONIGHT NOT TOMORROW" IF THE PRC WAS PREPARED TO OPEN </p><p>RELATIONS, SO THERE IS LITTLE DOUBT WHERE THE HOLY SEE STANDS </p><p>ON TAIWAN.  ROTA-GRAZIOSI SAID THE VATICAN WAS PREPARED TO </p><p>MAKE "THE LEAP OF FAITH" TO THE PRC\'S "ONE-CHINA" POLICY, </p><p>EVEN WHILE HE LAMENTED THAT THIS DID NOT REALLY REFLECT </p><p>TAIWAN\'S GLOBAL ROLE AND STATUS. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) REACTING TO THE CONCERN RAISED TO AMBASSADOR HANFORD </p><p>ABOUT THE NEED FOR THE POPE TO APOLOGIZE FOR THE OCTOBER 2000 </p><p>CANONIZATION OF CHINESE MARTYRS,  MONSIGNOR ROTA-GRAZIOSI </p><p>SAID THE POPE "WOULD NEVER APOLOGIZE FOR THE CANONIZATION." </p><p>ON THE OTHER HAND, HE NOTED THAT THE POPE HAD ALREADY </p><p>APOLOGIZED FOR THE CHURCH\'S "MISTAKES" IN THE PAST.  HE </p><p>LAMENTED THAT THE HOLY SEE HAS YET TO HEAR ANY FORMAL </p><p>RECOGNITION OF OR RESPONSE TO THIS OCTOBER 2001 APOLOGY. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) ROTA-GRAZIOSI EXPRESSED APPRECIATION FOR USG EFFORTS </p><p>TO FOSTER A DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE HOLY SEE AND CHINA AND FOR </p><p>OUR EFFORT TO PRESS FOR SHORTER AND MEDIUM-TERM CHANGES IN </p><p>RESTRICTIVE CHINESE POLICIES.  HE WAS SKEPTICAL, HOWEVER, </p><p>THAT CHINA WOULD BE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD, ADDING THAT IT WILL </p><p>"TAKE YEARS, IF NOT DECADES" FOR THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT TO </p><p>TRULY BE PREPARED TO EMBRACE RELIGIOUS FREEDOM.  HE EXPECTS </p><p>THE PRC WILL CONTINUE TO COMPLAIN ABOUT TAIWAN AND THE POPE\'S </p><p>CANONIZATION OF CHINESE MARTYRS TO AVOID AN OPEN DIALOGUE </p><p>WITH THE VATICAN.  ROTA-GRAZIOSI SAID THE HOLY SEE BELIEVES </p><p>PROGRESS FOR THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IN CHINA CAN BEST BE MADE BY </p><p>PROMOTING RELIGIOUS FREEDOM IN THE BROADEST SENSE FOR ALL </p><p>BELIEFS.  HE EXPRESSED HOPE THAT USG EFFORTS WILL PAY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  03962  130928Z </p><p>DIVIDENDS, BUT SAID CHANGING THE PRC\'S ATTITUDES IS "LIKE </p><p>DROPS OF WATER SCULPTING THE STONE". </p><p>HARDT </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> </p><p></p><p> 2002VATICA03962 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
