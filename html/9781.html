<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 ANKARA 004805 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT PASS USTR FOR WHITE </p><p>DEPT FOR E, EB/TPP, AND EUR/SE </p><p>USDA FOR FAS FOR ITP/SIMMONS, MEYER, RICHEY, FECITT </p><p>USDA FOR APHIS TERRI DUNAHAY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, EAGR, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: Turkey and Biotechnology </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but Unclassified.  Not for Internet Distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.   (SBU)  Summary: The development of biotechnology </p><p>legislation has been identified as a priority by the new </p><p>Turkish government. Regulations that parallel EU directives </p><p>have been drafted, however no action has been taken to put </p><p>them into place.  With the possible exception of the </p><p>Cartagena Biosafety Protocol, which the Turkish Parliament </p><p>recently ratified, there are no biotech regulations that </p><p>impact U.S. trade.  There is concern that a small number of </p><p>influential officials are spreading misinformation about the </p><p>safety of food and agricultural products developed using </p><p>biotechnology that will ultimately have a negative effect on </p><p>consumer perception and future legislation.  Local food and </p><p>agricultural companies are concerned yet remain quiet. </p><p>Annually, the United States exports approximately $250 </p><p>million of corn and soybean products for feed, up to $100 </p><p>million of corn and soybean oil and $200 million of cotton </p><p>to Turkey.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>Current and Potential Legislation </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>2.   (SBU) Biotechnology regulations in Turkey are limited </p><p>to a 1998 directive on field trials, which have since been </p><p>suspended (see Para 3).  While many industry observers </p><p>expect the void of regulation to continue, bureaucrats </p><p>insist that legislation will be published soon.  There are a </p><p>few signs that regulations are inevitable.  First, Turkey </p><p>ratified the Cartagena Biosafety Protocol on June 17, 2003. </p><p>If Turkey chooses to implement the biosafety protocol, some </p><p>type of regulatory framework will be needed. Sources also </p><p>indicate that Turkey has until 2005 to harmonize its </p><p>regulations with relevant EU directives in preparation for </p><p>accession talks.  Finally, the Genetics Laboratory at the </p><p>Ankara Provincial Control Laboratory of Molecular Biology </p><p>has been newly staffed and equipped and is awaiting </p><p>legislation to begin their work to test imports and domestic </p><p>products for GMO content. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>The brief regulatory history </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>3.   (SBU) In Turkey, regulations pertaining to the use and </p><p>importation of genetically modified organisms began when the </p><p>"Directive on the Principles of Field Trials of Genetically </p><p>Modified Organisms" issued by the Ministry of Agriculture </p><p>and Rural Affairs (MARA), entered into force in May 1998. </p><p>Note: This directive did not apply to, or otherwise affect </p><p>feed and food trade.  End Note.  After this date, several </p><p>field experiments with GMO crops were carried out in </p><p>different agronomic research institutes in the country. </p><p>Specific crops tested were corn, cotton and potatoes.  In </p><p>June 1999, the Ministry of Environment, through a circular, </p><p>warned all prefectures regarding the unauthorised planting </p><p>and use of genetically modified plants. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.   (SBU) Subsequently, an interagency commission on </p><p>"biotechnology and biosafety" which was established in the </p><p>framework of the Eighth Five-year Development Plan of the </p><p>State Planning Organisation issued a report stating that the </p><p>importation and experimental planting of genetically </p><p>modified seeds, authorised by the Ministry of Agriculture </p><p>and Rural Affairs, was hazardous, considering that Turkey </p><p>lacks regulation in the field, and qualified personnel to </p><p>ensure the controls. The commission requested that the </p><p>experiments be discontinued immediately, and that no other </p><p>authorisation be issued until the completion of legislation </p><p>and mechanisms of control. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.   (SBU) As a result, there has been no additional field </p><p>testing of biotech crops in Turkey.  While results of the </p><p>initial tests have been analysed by the Directorate of </p><p>Research and Development of MARA, the results - to the </p><p>frustration of industry participants and the scientific </p><p>community - have not been made public.  Again, the </p><p>suspension of this directive had no impact on trade. </p><p>Despite the potential benefits of producing BT corn and </p><p>cotton in Turkey, it is unlikely to occur in the near </p><p>future.  Monsanto, a large biotech seed developer, has </p><p>abandoned plans to introduce biotech seeds in Turkey, and is </p><p>instead producing and exporting conventional corn seeds </p><p>which it markets to the EU. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>A near ban and lessons learned </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>6.   (SBU) In July of 2000 MARA began developing regulations </p><p>which would prohibit imports of all food and feed products </p><p>not accompanied by `GMO-free\' certificates.  While </p><p>originally intending the ban to be immediate while </p><p>legislation was developed, it was later announced to go into </p><p>effect on January 1, 2001.  In the end, pressure from </p><p>industry groups - primarily the poultry industry and feed </p><p>millers association - convinced the GOT to suspend </p><p>implementation altogether.  The significance of these events </p><p>is that the GOT began to recognise that this issue has </p><p>greater economic implications for its domestic industries </p><p>than anticipated.  Since this event, the GOT has been much </p><p>more engaged with industry participants.  Further, the GOT </p><p>enlisted the Turkish Council of Scientific and Technical </p><p>Research (TBYTAK) to help develop legislation and a </p><p>national biosafety system taking into consideration </p><p>international standards. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>Recent draft legislation and references </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>7.   (SBU) In 2001, two draft directives were prepared, one </p><p>relating to the registration of genetically modified plants, </p><p>the other to the deliberate release of the GMOs into the </p><p>environment and their placement on the market.  While these </p><p>directives never went into effect, they drew heavily if not </p><p>exclusively from relevant EU directives.  It is fair to </p><p>expect that future legislation will also be designed to </p><p>conform to EU directives as well as the Biosafety Protocol. </p><p>The Accession Partnership document approved by the EU </p><p>Council on March 8, 2001 sets harmonisation with </p><p>environmental acquis communautaire as a medium term </p><p>objective. The National Programme for the Adoption of the </p><p>Acquis, presented by Turkey on March 19 2001, establishes </p><p>that the final objective concerning the deliberate release </p><p>into environment and the placing on the market of </p><p>genetically modified organisms in Turkey is to adopt and </p><p>apply pertinent EU legislation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.   (SBU) The Biotechnology and Biosafety Advisory </p><p>Committee, which includes representatives from MARA, </p><p>Environment, Health, Forestry, State Planning Office, and </p><p>the Undersecretariat of Foreign Trade has also prepared a </p><p>draft law for the establishment of a National Biosafety </p><p>Council, which in turn is intended to establish the national </p><p>biosafety system and legislation.  It is not clear to what </p><p>extent the Biosafety Advisory Committee and the National </p><p>Biosafety Council remain intact since the election of a new </p><p>government in 2002 and the appointment of a new Prime </p><p>Minister in 2003.  An official at the Undersecretariat of </p><p>Foreign Trade indicated that the Biosafety Advisory </p><p>Committee would be `formed\' in February of 2004. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p>Biotech atmosphere in the Turkish bureaucracy </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p>9.   (SBU) Many MARA officials have been publicly supportive </p><p>of biotechnology and the potential benefits the technology </p><p>may hold for Turkish producers.  Many others - in key </p><p>positions - are quite skeptical and misinformed and as a </p><p>result are actually spreading misinformation about the </p><p>safety of biotechnology to their colleagues and superiors. </p><p>For example, after hearing a sound science-based </p><p>presentation on the safety of bio-engineered foods from </p><p>another scientist, a Turkish biologist responded that she </p><p>would still never eat `those foods\'.  A general lack of </p><p>information prevails. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU) The Turkish Ministry of Agriculture and Rural </p><p>Affairs (MARA) has been relatively proactive to opening the </p><p>debate on biotechnology within the GOT.  Recently, MARA </p><p>officials approached FAS to host a seminar on biotechnology </p><p>in September. Much of this interest can be attributed to </p><p>ongoing outreach efforts and training activities that </p><p>engaged the GOT in the biotech debate. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>Atmosphere in the food and agricultural sectors </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>11.  (SBU) Many food companies are more concerned about </p><p>public perception than impending Turkish regulations.  Coca- </p><p>Cola and Pepsi, for example, require that all starch-based </p><p>sweeteners that they purchase be produced from non-GMO corn. </p><p>There is no law that requires this.  Many companies want to </p><p>ensure that their ability to export to the EU is preserved. </p><p>Some major food companies have received calls from consumers </p><p>asking if there are bio-engineered foods in their products. </p><p>In a recent meeting, these food companies said there was a </p><p>need for all major food companies to respond to these </p><p>concerns with one voice and one message.  Many other food </p><p>companies prefer the status quo: no regulations and no </p><p>consumer awareness.  While many of these food companies </p><p>recognize that they would benefit from educating consumers </p><p>and the GOT on issues related to biotechnology and food </p><p>safety, it is uncharted territory in Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  (SBU) In the next year, more outreach will be needed to </p><p>assist food and agricultural companies communicate </p><p>effectively with their customers and the GOT.  Even if the </p><p>best regulations are adopted, consumer acceptance of </p><p>biotechnology will be a major challenge in Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13.  (SBU) Conclusion: As Turkey recently ratified the </p><p>biosafety protocol, one can expect that regulations </p><p>governing the importation and marketing of biotech products </p><p>will soon follow.  Turkey is challenged by the dual need to </p><p>implement the biosafety protocol and develop comprehensive </p><p>regulations that adhere to EU directives. Experience </p><p>suggests that Turkey will protect the local feed industry, </p><p>yet may cave to perceived consumer concerns and implement </p><p>restrictive policies for biotech content in consumer foods. </p><p>In other words, future regulations will likely have a </p><p>greater impact on food products than feed products, and it </p><p>is not likely that Turkey will revisit field trials and </p><p>planting approvals until the EU progresses in this area. </p><p>While the U.S. market for $250 million in feed ingredients </p><p>and $200 million in cotton do not appear to be in jeopardy, </p><p>approximately $100 million in vegetable oil and corn and soy </p><p>food products may face restrictive regulations in the near </p><p>future. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEUTSCH </p><p></p></div>
