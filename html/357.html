<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ALEXANDRIA 00448 </p><p> </p><p>FOR NEA/EGY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PINT </p><p>SUBJECT:  ALEXANDRIA:  THE MOOD OF RAMADAN </p><p> </p><p>REF:  CAIRO 6435 </p><p> </p><p>1.  C - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>LIKE THE REST OF THE COUNTRY, EGYPT\'S SECOND CITY </p><p>ENTERED INTO RAMADAN ON MARCH 28 AND THE RESULTANT </p><p>REORIENTATION OF THE DAILY WORK AND LIVING ROUTINES TO </p><p>ACCOMODATE DAY-TIME FASTING AND NOCTURNAL FEASTING AND </p><p>FESTIVENESS.  THE OVERALL MOOD  IS OF AN EXTENDED </p><p>NOCTURNAL HOLIDAY SEASON, AND A PARTICULARLY INTENSE </p><p>SOCIAL LIFE.  IT IS QUALIFIED, HOWEVER, BY A SHARPER </p><p>SQUEEZE THIS YEAR THAN IN PAST YEARS RESULTING FROM </p><p>DECREASED AVAILABILITY OF FOOD STAPLES EXCEPT AT MUCH </p><p>HIGHER BLACK MARKET PRICES, OFTEN DOUBLE THE USUAL RATES. </p><p>WHILE OUR CONTACTS COMMONLY ESTIMATE THAT NO MORE THAN </p><p>60 PERCENT OF ALEXANDRIANS COMPLY FULLY WITH RELIGIOUSLY </p><p>PRESCRIBED ABSTINANCE, E.G., FROM FOOD, DRINK AND </p><p>NICOTINE  DURING DAYLIGHT HOURS, PROBABLY 80-90 PERCENT </p><p>OF THE POPULACE ARE CAREFUL TO OBSERVE THESE STRICTURES </p><p>IN PUBLIC.  THERE IS A CLEAR SENSE OF HEIGHTENING SOCIAL </p><p>PRESSURE TO CONFORM WITH THE PUBLIC REPEAT PUBLIC </p><p>NORMS OF BEHAVIOR, CONSISTENT WITH AN OVERALL CONTEXT </p><p>OF SLOW BUT SURELY CONTINUING TREND OF ISLAMIC RELIGIOSITY. </p><p>ATTENTION TO AND DISCUSSION OF POLITICAL ISSUES SEEMS TO </p><p>HAVE SLACKENED WITH THE NOTABLE EXCEPTION OF INCREASING </p><p>FOCUS AMONG THE POLITICALLY LITERATE ON ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN </p><p>ISSUES, NOTABLYSOVIETJEWISH IMMIGRATION.  END SUMMARY. </p><p>-- </p><p> </p><p>3.  DAY INTO NIGHT </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>WITH A MOSLEM MAJORITY OF PERHAPS 85 PERCENT OF ITS </p><p>ROUGHLY 5 MILLION INHABITANTS, ALEXANDRIA ON MARCH 28 </p><p>ENTERED THE LUNAR MONTH-LONG PERIOD OF RAMADAN AND RE- </p><p>ORIENTED MUCH OF ROUTINE ACTIVITY FROM DAY TO NIGHT. </p><p>ABOUT A WEEK LATER, THE COPTIC CHRISTIANS WHO MAKE UP </p><p>MOST OF THE REMAINDER ENTERED INTO THEIR OBSERVANCE OF </p><p>LENTEN FASTING.  WITH NOCTURNAL FEASTING BEGINNING AT THE </p><p>CRACK OF CANNONS AND CALLS TO PRAYER SIGNALLING SUNDOWN </p><p>FOLLOWED BY NIGHT TIME PROMENADES, CALLS ON FRIENDS AND </p><p>FAMILY AND SORTIES TO OPEN-AIR CARNIVALS, MOST ALEXANDRIANS </p><p>DO NOT GET TO BED BEFORE ONE OR TWO IN THE MORNING.  THEY </p><p>THEN WAKE FOR A PRE-DAWN BREAKFAST.  AS A RESULT, THE </p><p>WORK DAY COMMONLY DOES NOT BEGIN BEFORE TEN OR ELEVEN </p><p>IN THE MORNING AND LASTS ONLY UNTIL 2:30 OR 4:00 IN </p><p>THE AFTERNOON, ALTHOUGH STORES AND SERVICE SHOPS GEN- </p><p>ERALLY REOPEN AT 7:30 FOR BUSINESS UNTIL 11:00 OR EVEN </p><p>LATER.  BY LATE IN THE AFTERNOON, THE PRESCRIBED AB- </p><p>STINENCE FROM FOOD, DRINK, AND CIGARETTES HAS LOWERED </p><p>THE COLLECTIVE ENERGY LEVEL PERCEPTIBLY AND, NOTABLY </p><p>AMONG MOTORISTS ANXIOUS TO GET HOME FOR A QUICK NAP </p><p>BEFORE ANOTHER HEAVY NOCTURNAL SCHEDULE, TEMPERS HAVE </p><p>BEEN SHARPENED. </p><p> </p><p>4.  CONTACTS EXPLAIN TO THIS OBSERVOR EXPERIENCING </p><p>HIS FIRST RAMADAN IN EGYPT, THAT PERHAPS 85 OR 90 </p><p>PERCENT OF MOSLEMS ARE CAREFUL TO OBSERVE PUBLICALLY </p><p>REPEAT PUBLICALLY THE NORMS OF DAY TIME ABSTINENCE, BUT </p><p>THAT PROBABLY 20-30 PERCENT CANNOT RESIST THE </p><p>TEMPTATION TO SNEAK A CIGARETTE OR A FURTIVE COFFEE OR </p><p>SOFT DRINK AND, PERHAPS, EVEN A SNACK.  THE FEW MAJOR </p><p>TOURIST HOTELS SELL ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES ONLY TO FOREIGNERS </p><p>AND THEN ONLY FROM 5:30 OR 6:00 IN THE EVENING UNTIL </p><p>MIDNIGHT IN CAREFULLY LIMITED AREAS.  BY COMMON CON- </p><p>SENSUS, EVEN THE MINORITY OF MOSLEMS WHO REGULARLY IN- </p><p>BIBE A WHISKEY OR GIN AND TONIC AT FESTIVE OCCASIONS </p><p>DURING THE REST OF THE YEAR, ARE CAREFUL TO ABSTAIN </p><p>PUBLICALLY AND TOTALLY NOW.  THAT SAID, PIETY IS PRACTICAL </p><p>ECONOMIC SENSE FOR THE TYPICAL LOW INCOME ALEXANDRIAN. </p><p>THE LATTER\'S SALARY IS ABOUT THE EQUIVALENT OF US100 </p><p>DOLLARS MONTHLY.  BEER AND LIQUOR ARE WELL BEYOND HIS </p><p>PRICE RANGE -- AT ANYWHERE FROM THE EQUIVALENT OF ONE </p><p>DOLLAR TO THREE DOLLARS PER LIBATION -- SO OBLIGATORY </p><p>TEMPERANCE DURING RAMADAN REPRESENTS VIRTUALLY NO </p><p>CHANGE FROM HIS USUAL LIFE STYLE YEAR-ROUND.  DAILY </p><p>PRAYING IS, WE ARE TOLD, MARKEDLY MORE FREQUENT. </p><p>OVERALL, THERE IS A SENSE OF A CONTINUED, GRADUAL </p><p>TIGHTENING OF SOCIAL PRESSURES TO OBSERVE ISLAMIC NORMS </p><p>IN KEEPING WITH A YEAR-ROUND TREND OF INCREASING RELI- </p><p>GIOSITY IN OUTWARD DRESS AND BEHAVIOR. </p><p> </p><p>5.  FOOD:  AVAILABILITY AND PRICE SQUEEZE </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>THE GENERALLY FESTIVE NOCTURNAL HOLIDAY ATMOSPHERE HAS </p><p>BEEN QUALIFIED SIGNIFICANTLY BY A FOOD AVAILABILITY </p><p>AND PRICE SQUEEZE WHICH IS PERCEPTIBLY SHARPER THIS YEAR </p><p>THAN PREVIOUSLY.  ALEXANDRIANS INSIST THAT THEY PROBABLY </p><p>CONSUME AS MUCH OR MORE OF CERTAIN TYPES OF FOODS DURING </p><p>THIS LUNAR  MONTH THAN THEY DO IN THE REMAINING 11 MONTHS </p><p>OF THE YEAR COMBINED.  NOTABLY, HUGE AMOUNTS OF SYRUPY </p><p>AND OTHER HIGHLY SWEETENED CAKES, PASTRIES AND OTHER </p><p>RICH DESSERT GOODIES.  FURTHER, IN A CULTURE NOTABLE </p><p>FOR COMPULSIVE HOSPITALITY, RAMADAN BRINGS THAT IMPULSE </p><p>TO A FEVERISH PEAK.  THUS, BY DISTORTING ANNUAL </p><p>BUDGETS AND/OR BORROWING, MOST ALEXANDRIANS SPEND AS </p><p>MUCH OR MORE THAN THEY CAN POSSIBLY AFFORD TO OBSERVE </p><p>A DAILY PRACTICE OF LAVISH HOSPITALITY. </p><p> </p><p>6.  FLOUR, SUGAR, COOKING OIL AND RICE, IN THAT DESCEND- </p><p>ING ORDER OR PRIORITY, HAVE BEEN NOTICEABLY SCARCE SINCE </p><p>THE SECOND WEEK OF MARCH.  AVAILABILITY OF THESE STAPLES </p><p>IS GENERALLY RESTRICTED TO BLACK MARKET SOURCES WHO </p><p>DEMAND AND GET TWO AND THREE TIMES THE NORMAL PRICES. </p><p>(E.G., FLOUR, SUGAR AND RICE ARE SELLING AT DOUBLE THE </p><p>USUAL  PRICE, WHILE THE BETTER QUALITY OF COOKING OIL </p><p>HAS SOARED OUT OF THE REACH OF MANY CONSUMERS.)  PUSHING </p><p>AND SHOVING AT GOVERNMENT-OWNED OUTLETS BY POORER </p><p>ALEXANDRIANS EAGER TO GET THEIR RATIONS OF THE ABOVE </p><p>STAPLES HAS BECOME MORE INTENSE.  HOWEVER, THERE HAS BEEN </p><p>NO REPEAT OF A TRAGIC INCIDENT IN THE DELTA TOWN OF KAFR </p><p>DAWAR WHERE ON MARCH 26 FOUR WOMEN REPORTEDLY </p><p>WERE CRUSHED TO DEATH IN A MOB LINED UP OUTSIDE </p><p>A DISTRIBUTION OUTLET.  NEVERTHELESS, THERE IS </p><p>RESENTFUL GOSSIP ABOUT GOVERNMENT OUTLET EMPLOYEES </p><p>AND PRIVATE GROCERS LICENSED TO SELL GOVERNMENT- </p><p>SUPPLIED COMMODITIES.  THOSE ADVANTAGEOUSLY PLACED </p><p>ARE PROFITING HANDSOMELY FROM SALES OF GOVERNMENT </p><p>STOCKS TO AFFLUENT INDIVIDUALS OR CORPORATE BUYERS </p><p>LIKE RESTAURANTS OR HOTELS.  FURTHER, FRESH VEGETABLES </p><p>HAVE JUMPED 30 PERCENT OR MORE OVER THEIR USUAL </p><p>PRICE LEVELS.  LOCAL POLICE HAVE ATTEMPTED TO CRACK </p><p>DOWN ON MERCHANTS GUILTY OF THE MOST EGREGIOUS PRICE- </p><p>GOUGING BUT TO LITTLE EFFECT IN ELIMINATING IT AS </p><p>A PREVALING PRACTICE. </p><p> </p><p>7.  ON BALANCE, HOWEVER, THE STRIKING EGYPTIAN </p><p>TRAIT OF SOMEHOW MAKING DO HAS ASSERTED ITSELF </p><p>AND THE MOOD ON THE STREETS -- BASED ON OUR SIDEWALK </p><p>SORTIES APRIL 4 AND APRIL 9 AT NIGHT INTO THE CENTRAL </p><p>ALEXANDRIA AREA -- IS GENERALLY RELAXED.  BARRING </p><p>ANY FURTHER OR SUDDEN REDUCTION IN THE AVIALABILITY </p><p>OF FOOD, THERE IS NO DISCERNIBLE INDICATION OF ANYTHING </p><p>THAT MIGHT SPARK PUBLIC UNREST. </p><p> </p><p>8.  NEVERTHELESS, WE NOTE AMONG THETPOLITICALLY </p><p>LITERATE CLUSTERS OF ELITE OPINION AN INCREASING </p><p>CRITICAL INTEREST IN U.S. POLICIES ON THE ISSUES OF </p><p>SOVIET JEWISH IMMIGRATION TO ISRAEL AND, MOST RECENTLY, </p><p>THE STATUS OF JERUSALEM.  INDEED, AT A SUNDOWN DINNER </p><p>"IFTAR" OF THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE ON APRIL 4, HOSTED </p><p>BY THE LOCAL EGYPTIAN-AMERICAN FRIENDSHIP ASSOCIATION </p><p>IN HIS HONOR, AMBASSADOR WISNER WAS ASKED, WITH </p><p>IMPECCABLE COURTESY IN AN EXTREMELY ORDIAL </p><p>SETTING, TO "EXPLAIN" THE U.S. POSITION. WARMLY </p><p>APPLUADED FOR BOTH HIS PREPARED REMARKS AND THE Q AND </p><p>A SESSION THAT FOLLOWED DURING THE AMBASSADOR\'S </p><p>HOUR-AND-A-QUARTER SESSION, WE NOTE THAT PRIVATE </p><p>REMARKS TO US LATER FOCUSSED ON THE AMBASSADOR\'S </p><p>ELOQUENCE BUT THAT CONCERNS ON THE SUBSTANCE OF THE </p><p>IMMIGRATION QUESTION REMAIN UNABATED.  INTERESTINGLY, </p><p>WE SINCE HAVE HEARD FROM BUSINESS COMMUNITY CONTACTS </p><p>THE APPREHENSIVE REASONING THAT GIVEN THE PRESUMED </p><p>TERRITORIAL INABILITY OF BOTH ISRAEL PROPER AND </p><p>THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES LITERALLY TO ACCOMODATE </p><p>SOVIET JEWS, THE ISRAELIS ULITMATELY WILL BE OBLIGED </p><p>TO "RE-TAKE" THE SINAI LANDS CEDED TO EGYPT.  INDEED, </p><p>AS THE COLLECTIVE ATTENTION OF ALEXANDRIANS FOCUSES </p><p>LITERALLY ON INGESTION AND DIGESTION, INTEREST </p><p>IN POLITICAL ISSUES AMONG OUR RANGE OF USUAL </p><p>BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONAL CIRCLE CONTACTS HAS </p><p>SLACKENED. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MAXIM </p><p></p></div>
