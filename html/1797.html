<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 001587 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/02/2011 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, MASS, MARR, KCRM, SNAR, ETRD, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: AMBASSADOR MEETS WITH NSA ON REGIONAL AND </p><p>OTHER ISSUES </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter, reason 1.5(B/D) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  Ambassador Jeter met July 2 with National Security </p><p>Advisor (NSA) Aliyu Mohammed.  Regional issues dominated </p><p>discussions.  The NSA noted GON support for "internal </p><p>dialogue" outside Liberia.  He indicated the GON would host </p><p>an Abuja-based John Garang/Sadiq Al-Mahdi meeting on Sudan, </p><p>and voiced support for an expanded UN presence in DROC.  The </p><p>NSA said Jonas Savimbi had requested a meeting with Obasanjo, </p><p>but the GON wished to speak to Angolan President Dos Santos </p><p>first.  He indicated GON support for Namibian Foreign </p><p>Minister Gurirab for the OAU SecGen position, and said that </p><p>the Western Sahara did have a full-fledged Embassy in Abuja. </p><p>Regarding bilateral mil-mil assistance, the NSA said that all </p><p>OFR trucks had now been accounted for, including the two that </p><p>had gone missing, and would be shipped to Sierra Leone for </p><p>use by the Nigerian UNAMSIL contingent.  He pledged to solve </p><p>the problem of lack of counterparts for MPRI after the </p><p>Ambassador indicated the program appeared to be failing. </p><p>Mohammed also asked for another complete set of requirements </p><p>for the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) assessment, said </p><p>the GON would work hard to combat trafficking in women and </p><p>children, indicated renewed efforts to ensure a larger budget </p><p>for NDLEA, and said Obasanjo would convene a meeting of Niger </p><p>Delta leaders with oil companies, NGOs, and community </p><p>stake-holders to once again explore the prospects for peace </p><p>and development.  Embassy asked that the Embassy also be </p><p>invited to this meeeting.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  Ambassador Jeter met July 2 with the NSA, General </p><p>(ret.) Aliyu Mohammed, in Abuja.  Also in attendance were </p><p>Regional Affairs Counselor Twombley paying his farewell call, </p><p>and Poloff.  Mohammed\'s Assistant, Colonel Idris was also </p><p>present as notetaker.  This meeting was designed, inter alia, </p><p>as a follow-up on regional issues raised by President </p><p>Obasanjo during his May visit to Washington. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) On Sierra Leone, the NSA optimistically assessed the </p><p>disarmament process, although he expressed concern, with the </p><p>rainy season underway, of possible weather delays.  Unaware </p><p>that Ambassador William Swing\'s name had surfaced regarding </p><p>the UN SRSG position in Sierra Leone, the NSA said that the </p><p>GON would probably prefer that Ambassador Adeniji continue in </p><p>that position, but he would "check on that."  Ambassador told </p><p>the NSA that from the indirect reading he had gotten from </p><p>President Obasanjo during an earlier inquiry, the issue </p><p>seemed to be closed and we were not asking that it be </p><p>revisited.  Ambassador Jeter said that he was simply </p><p>informing the NSA so that he would be aware. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  On the subject of "internal dialogue" in Liberia, </p><p>Ambassador Jeter reprised his discussion with ECOWAS ExecSec </p><p>Kouyate and gave his view that any attempt to include Taylor </p><p>or conduct the dialogue within Liberia would risk both </p><p>legitimizing Taylor and embittering Conte of Guinea.  It had </p><p>to be done outside Liberia.  The NSA, although humorously </p><p>paraphrasing a local proverb, "You can\'t shave a head if the </p><p>head (Taylor\'s) isn\'t there," said that the GON would be </p><p>willing to host such a "dialogue," or support it logistically </p><p>at some other forum outside Liberia, if the U.S. thought this </p><p>would be worthwhile.  Ambassador said that this was not a </p><p>U.S. issue, and it was really up to the region to decide how </p><p>to proceed.  Kouyate still seemed very interested in the </p><p>idea, Ambassador said.  "I will contact President Konare of </p><p>Mali," the NSA replied, "and Executive Secretary Kouyate on </p><p>this." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) On Sudan, Mohammed said that the GON would soon host a </p><p>meeting between John Garang and Sadiq al-Mahdi, and that </p><p>al-Mahdi was already in the country.   Obasanjo would also </p><p>raise the issue at the upcoming OAU summit in Lusaka. </p><p>Mohammed said that the general perception within the GON was </p><p>that Garang was the problem.  Ambassador Jeter responded that </p><p>the USG was reviewing its Sudan policy, particularly </p><p>regarding Sudan\'s support for terrorism, its interference </p><p>with humanitarian operations, and the likely prospect of a </p><p>viable peace process.   Past bombings of humanitarian workers </p><p>had provoked widespread anger within the USG, the Ambassador </p><p>said.  The NSA said the GON had asked Sudan to halt the </p><p>bombing, and thought that it had, but Jeter said it was not </p><p>so clear that Sudan was complying with this request, beyond a </p><p>brief pause.  Ambassador said that we would seek up-to-date </p><p>information from the department on current humanitarian </p><p>operations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) On the DROC, Mohammed expressed general satisfaction </p><p>with Kabila the Younger during his short reign as President. </p><p>The country faced an enormous number of problems, not the </p><p>least being the continuing presence of elements of nine </p><p>foreign armies on her soil, he said.  But Kabila was </p><p>performing well.  Nigeria had 33 police trainers in Kinshasa, </p><p>and looked for other ways to assist, he said.  The clear </p><p>solution, he noted, was greater UN involvement, together with </p><p>useful interventions by outside parties. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  On Angola, the NSA said that Savimbi had asked for a </p><p>meeting with Obasanjo, but he had been told to "stand by." </p><p>The GON meant to check with President Dos Santos before </p><p>taking any action on Savimbi\'s request, said Mohammed. </p><p>Obasanjo hoped to confer with Dos Santos at the OAU summit in </p><p>Lusaka.  Moving briefly to the race for the Secretary General </p><p>of the OAU, Mohammed said that the GON supported Namibian </p><p>Foreign Minister Gurirab.  An earlier deal involving SADC </p><p>support for Konare of Mali had fallen through when Konare </p><p>withdrew, and now the GON felt obligated to support Gurirab, </p><p>particularly given the request of President Mbeki of South </p><p>Africa to do so. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) On Western Sahara, Mohammed acknowledged that the GON </p><p>had opened official relations with the Sharawi Republic, but </p><p>he was not sure at what level. (Note: the Moroccan Embassy </p><p>tells us that the Sahrawi Embassy is represented by an </p><p>Ambassador, and that the Sahrawi Mission enjoys the normal </p><p>range of diplomatic contacts with the GON.  End Note).  The </p><p>NSA went on to say that the GON supported the Baker UN </p><p>initiative, hoped it would continue, and hoped the Bush </p><p>Administration would support it, too. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) On bilateral mil/mil assistance, the Ambassador said </p><p>that matters were proceeding "much better" on various fronts. </p><p> The DATT enjoyed a much better relationship with his </p><p>counterparts.  The three bases had been identified for OFR </p><p>III, and work would begin soon to ready them for OFR </p><p>training.  The Ambassador noted that, on the subject of </p><p>trucks for OFR III, unless the trucks now in Nigeria from OFR </p><p>I were sent to Sierra Leone, we would be unable to provide </p><p>trucks for OFR III. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) Idris responded that all were now accounted for, and </p><p>would be shipped.  The NSA pledged to speak to the Chief of </p><p>Army Staff on this issue.  On the question of the Forward </p><p>Operating Base (FOB) for OFR III, the USG preferred to use </p><p>Abuja, but had not seen any progress on this decision.  The </p><p>NSA recommended that the Ambassador speak to Minister of </p><p>Defense Danjuma about the FOB. (Comment.  We have done so, </p><p>and hope we have a decision from Danjuma before he leaves for </p><p>foreign travel later today, July 5.  End comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) On MPRI, the Ambassador said that the program risked </p><p>being a failure without proper counterparts for the MPRI </p><p>personnel.  Mohammed said that "we are working on this," </p><p>including the provision of retired officers as counterparts. </p><p>"We will make this work," he said.  Regarding the request </p><p>from the National Assembly that MPRI open an office at the </p><p>Assembly building, the NSA requested that, although it was an </p><p>idea with merit, "this should not be done now." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) The conversation finished with several bilateral </p><p>issues, tracking the Ambassador\'s earlier conversation with </p><p>the President. The NSA asked for a new complete set of the </p><p>requirements for compliance with the Financial Action Task </p><p>Force (septel).  He expressed surprise at the lack of proper </p><p>information, and said he would meet with Finance Minister </p><p>Ciroma and Attorney General Ige to ensure proper forwarding </p><p>of the required information.  The NSA was aware that </p><p>narcotics certification was a yearly exercise, and he said </p><p>that the Obasanjo Administration was working hard to win a </p><p>sufficient budget for the NDLEA from the National Assembly </p><p>(now putting the finishing touches on a FY 2001 Supplemental </p><p>Budget).  The NSA also acknowledged the rising crime problem </p><p>in Lagos, noted the recent success of checkpoints on Ikoyi </p><p>and Victoria islands, and said "we will succeed" in reducing </p><p>crime. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) When the Ambassador expressed concern on the apparent </p><p>rising tension in the Niger Delta, the NSA noted the recent </p><p>hostage taking, peacefully resolved, at Bonny Island, and </p><p>said President Obasanjo would convene a meeting of oil and </p><p>service industry executives, traditional and political </p><p>leaders in the Delta, members of the National Assembly, and </p><p>South-South State Governors to discuss the events in the </p><p>region.  "We are in touch with Exxon/Mobil nearly every day," </p><p>he said, and "we are aware of their concerns."  At Ambassador </p><p>Jeter\'s request, the NSA said that the Embassy could send an </p><p>observer to this meeting.  He also agreed with the </p><p>Ambassador\'s assessment that the Production Sharing Contracts </p><p>bid process was slow, but did not offer an opinion on the </p><p>matter.  Digressing for a moment, on the question of </p><p>trafficking of women and children from Nigeria, the NSA noted </p><p>the close involvement of a small NGO headed by Vice President </p><p>Atiku\'s wife in this issue, and said he would contact the </p><p>Attorney General and the Inspector General of Police to </p><p>encourage redoubled efforts to discourage trafficking. </p><p>Finally, the Ambassador handed over a letter concerning the </p><p>National ID Card project from Chams/Polaroid Consortium, </p><p>which the NSA pledged to study and refer to the proper </p><p>officials. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C)  Comment. As always, the NSA proved attentive, </p><p>helpful and willing to intervene where his assistance could </p><p>be useful.  There has already been significant follow-up on </p><p>the issues raised with the NSA and the President.  End </p><p>comment. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
