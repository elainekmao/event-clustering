Gnehm.  Reasons 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) During a November 4 meeting with the Ambassador that </p><p>covered a number of topics (other subjects reported septels), </p><p>FonMin Muasher pledged that Jordan "will respond positively, </p><p>but in a credible manner" to the U.S. request to sign an </p><p>Article 98 agreement.  Muasher went on to note that, as </p><p>President of the ICC Member States Group, Jordan has "special </p><p>responsibilities.  We\'re not Micronesia."  He said that he </p><p>has asked Jordan\'s PermRep in New York, Prince Zeid, to </p><p>"negotiate this with Ambassador Negroponte and go through the </p><p>text point by point.  I understand that others -- Kuwait and </p><p>Bahrain -- have agreed, but they are not ICC signatories.  We </p><p>will sign, but we must do it correctly.  Just give us a week </p><p>or two." </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) For USUN: If the above description of the state of </p><p>play in New York is not accurate, please let us know so that </p><p>we can go back to the MFA with any concerns. </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
