SUMMARY:  ALL MEDIA PROMINENTLY HIGHLIGHTED THE CONTENTS OF </p><p>THE UNMOVIC AND IAEA REPORTS ON IRAQ.  EDITORIALS IN THE ARABIC </p><p>PRESS LAUDED EUROPEAN OPPOSITION TO A WAR AGAINST IRAQ, </p><p>DESCRIBING FRENCH AND GERMAN OPPOSITION AS A STUMBLING BLOCK TO </p><p>AMERICA\'S THIRST FOR WAR.  ANOTHER EDITORIAL CLAIMED THAT </p><p>WASHINGTON SEES ONLY THE NEGATIVE ASPECTS OF THE UN REPORT TO USE </p><p>THEM AS A JUSTIFICATION FOR A WAR ON IRAQ.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. COMMENTING ON THE UNMOVIC AND IAEA REPORTS, DUBAI-BASED </p><p>BUSINESS-ORIENTED DAILY "AL-BAYAN" ON 1/28 EDITORIALIZED: </p><p> </p><p>"THE ENTIRE WORLD, EXCEPT FOR THE U.S., BRITAIN AND ISRAEL, </p><p>REJECT THE OPTION OF WAR BECAUSE IT REPRESENTS A CATASTROPHE </p><p>WHOSE CONSEQUENCES MAY EXTEND BEYOND THE REGION ... HOWEVER, THE </p><p>EUROPEAN UNION REFUSES TO SURRENDER TO THE AMERICAN-BRITISH WILL </p><p>(TO GO TO WAR) ... SO FAR, ALL SIGNALS INDICATE THAT FRANCE AND </p><p>GERMANY REPRESENT A STUMBLING BLOCK FOR AN AMERICAN-BRITISH </p><p>THIRST FOR WAR.  THE VOICE OF WISDOM SHOULD URGE US TO ALLOW THE </p><p>UN INSPECTORS MORE TIME TO FINISH THEIR JOB ..." </p><p> </p><p>3.  UNDER THE HEADLINE "TIME IS NOT LOST FOR A SOLUTION", ABU </p><p>DHABI-BASED PAN-ARAB DAILY "AKHBAR AL-ARAB" ON 1/28 </p><p>EDITORIALIZED: </p><p> </p><p>"... IRAQ REQUIRES MORE TIME TO MAKE ESSENTIAL CHANGES IN ITS </p><p>SYSTEM, IDEOLOGIES, AND BEHAVIOR.  IT ALSO NEEDS MORE TIME ... TO </p><p>TALK TO ALL POLITICAL PARTIES AND OTHER FORCES THAT WOULD </p><p>CONTRIBUTE TO THE BUILDING A NEW DEMOCRATIC IRAQ ...

CRITICIZING THE U.S. ADMINISTRATION\'S INTERPRETATION OF THE </p><p>UNMOVIC AND IAEA REPORTS, PAN-ARAB SHARJAH-BASED DAILY "AL- </p><p>KHALEEJ" EDITORIALIZED ON 1/29: </p><p> </p><p>"IT SEEMS CLEAR THAT THE U.S. HAS CHOSEN TO USE ONLY THE NEGATIVE </p><p>PARTS OF THE UN REPORTS IN ITS ACCUSATION OF IRAQ\'S NON- </p><p>COMPLIANCE ... THE AMERICAN POSITION REGARDING THE UN REPORTS </p><p>RESEMBLES ITS PREVIOUS POSITIONS.  IN FACT, WASHINGTON USES THE </p><p>NEGATIVE CONTENT IN THE REPORT AS A JUSTIFICATION TO ATTRACT </p><p>OTHER NATIONS TO OPT FOR WAR, CLAIMING THAT IRAQ\'S WMD CAN ONLY </p><p>BE ELIMINATED BY FORCE ..." </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
