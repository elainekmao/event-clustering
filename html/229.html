<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L BAGHDAD 04620 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS: PREL, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: "THE GREAT SATAN NO LONGER A SATAN" </p><p> </p><p>1. CONFIDENTIAL ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2. SUMMARY: IRAQ HAS CONTINUED TO WARN AGAINST </p><p>COUNTRIES WHICH WOULD TRY TO "DEPRIVE IRAQ OF ITS </p><p>VICTORY" AND REGAIN THEIR LOST INPLUENCE IN IRAN. </p><p>REFLECTING IRAQI FEARS OF A U.S.-IRANIAN RAPPROCHE- </p><p>MENT, THE WARNINGS QUOTE FOREIGN PRESS REPORTS </p><p>THAT THE U.S. EMBASSY IN TEHRAN IS BEING REFURBISHED </p><p>AND NOTE THAT "NO ONE IN TEHRAN CURSES THE ARCH </p><p>SATAN ANY LONGER."  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  IRAQI MEDIA AUGUST 22, GAVE PROMINENT COVERAGE </p><p>TO REPORTS ORIGINALLY PUBLISHED IN THE MADRID </p><p>NEWSPAPER EL PAIS AND THE PARIS WEEKLY EXPRESS, </p><p>THAT THE AMERICAN EMBASSY BUILDINGS IN TEHRAN ARE </p><p>BEING REFURBISHED.  EXPRESS IS QUOTED THAT THE </p><p>IRANIAN REGIME INTENDS TO VINDICATE THE "GREAT </p><p>SATAN," WHILE EL PAIS IS REPORTEDLY MORE EXPLICIT, </p><p>DECLARING THAT IRAN IS MOVING QUICKLY TO REESTAB- </p><p>LISH RELATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES.  EL PAIS\'S </p><p>TEHRAN CORRESPONDENT REPORTS THAT PREPARATIONS WERE </p><p>UNDERWAY AT THE U.S. EMBASSY TO REINSTATE NORMAL </p><p>ACTIVITIES. </p><p> </p><p>4. ALSO ON AUGUST 22, THE MAIN EDITORIAL IN BOTH THE </p><p>BA\'TH PARTY AND GOVERNMENT NEWSPAPERS (THAWRA AND </p><p>JUMHURIYA) WARNED THAT UNNAMED POWERS ARE "MANEUVERING </p><p>TO DEPRIVE IRAQ OF ITS VICTORY."  THESE POWERS ARE </p><p>ACCUSED OF TRYING TO INFLUENCE THE UPCOMING NEGOTIA- </p><p>TIONS TO REGAIN THEIR LOST INFLUENCE IN IRAN.  A </p><p>SIMILAR EDITORIAL IN THAWRA ON AUGUST 21 CLAIMED </p><p>THAT "NO ONE IN THE CAPITALS OF THESE STATES ANY </p><p>LONGER CONDEMNS IRANIAN STATE TERRORISM OR IRANIAN </p><p>EXTORTION THROUGH HOLDING HOSTAGES.  AT THE SAME </p><p>TIME, NO ONE IN TEHRAN CURSES OR REMEMBERS THE ARCH </p><p>SATAN ANY LONGER" (FBIS JN2108072288). </p><p> </p><p>5. COMMENT: THE IRAQIS\' FEAR OF U.S.-IRAN RAPPROACHE- </p><p>MENT HAS BEEN REFLECTED MORE PROMINENTLY IN THE PAST </p><p>WEEK\'S MEDIA THAN PREVIOUSLY.  WE WOULD ASSUME SADDAM </p><p>GAVE A SIGNAL OF CONCERN TO HIS INFORMATION MINISTER </p><p>JASIM, WHO HAS ALWAYS BEEN READY TO ABUSE THE UNITED </p><p>STATES.  WHAT IS NOT CLEAR TO US IS WHAT THE U.S. </p><p>HAS DONE, SINCE THE TALABANI AFFAIR AT LEAST, THAT </p><p>WOULD HAVE SPURRED THIS CONCERN. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GLASPIE </p><p></p></div>
