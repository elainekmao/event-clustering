<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L VATICAN 003575 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR EUR/WE (CEFKIN); DRL/IRF (FARR) </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/19/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PHUM, KIRF, CH, VT </p><p>SUBJECT: VATICAN COMMENTS ON IRF BEIJING VISIT </p><p> </p><p>REF: FARR/HARDT EMAIL OF 07/18/02 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: CHARGE D. BRENT HARDT FOR REASONS E.O.12958 1.5 (B), (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  IN THE ABSENCE OF ARCHBISHOP CLAUDIO MARIA CELLI, </p><p>THE VATICAN\'S MAIN CHINA HAND, POLOFFS ON 07/19 MET TO </p><p>DISCUSS REFEMAIL POINTS WITH VATICAN CHINA DESKOFF, MSGR. </p><p>GIANFRANCO ROTA-GRAZIOSI.  ROTA-GRAZIOSI RECOMMENDED THREE </p><p>POSSIBLE APPROACHES FOR AMBASSADOR HANFORD TO PUT FORWARD TO </p><p>HELP UNBLOCK PRC/HOLY SEE DIALOGUE DURING HIS UPCOMING TRIP </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  03575  191444Z </p><p>TO BEIJING.  AVERRING THAT NOT MUCH WILL HAPPEN BEFORE THE </p><p>CCP PARTY CONFERENCE IN OCTOBER, ROTA-GRAZIOSI SEEMED </p><p>RESIGNED TO THE LIKELIHOOD THAT YEARS WOULD PASS BEFORE </p><p>PRC/HOLY SEE DIALOGUE WOULD BEAR FRUIT.  HE HELD LITTLE HOPE </p><p>THAT BEIJING COULD BE PERSUADED OFFICIALLY TO REOPEN DIALOGUE </p><p>WITH THE HOLY SEE, MUCH LESS TO CONCLUDE A SINO-VATICAN </p><p>AGREEMENT BEFORE PRC PRESIDENT JIANG VISITS THE U.S. IN THE </p><p>FALL. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  ROTA-GRAZIOSI WAS CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC, HOWEVER, ON </p><p>THREE LIMITED STEPS THAT THE DRL/IRF DELEGATION MIGHT URGE </p><p>THE PRC TO TAKE DURING THE DRL/IRF LATE JULY VISIT TO </p><p>BEIJING.  FOR EXAMPLE THE PRC MIGHT HOST AN OFFICIAL </p><p>DELEGATION FROM THE HOLY SEE.  HE SAID THAT THE HOLY SEE HAS </p><p>PROPOSED ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS TO THE PRC THAT AN ENVOY BE </p><p>ALLOWED TO MAKE AN OFFICIAL VISIT TO CHINA TO TRAVEL TO </p><p>VARIOUS DIOCESES AND HOLD MEETINGS WITH CLERGY FROM BOTH THE </p><p>OFFICIAL CHURCH AND THE UNDERGROUND CHURCH.  IN THE PAST, </p><p>CARDINAL ETCHEGARRAY HAS VISITED, BUT ONLY AS A "PRIVATE </p><p>PERSON."  HE MUSED THAT AN OFFICIAL HOLY SEE VISITOR COULD BE </p><p>QITHER CARDINAL OR BISHOP RANK, AND MIGHT EVEN CELEBRATE A </p><p>MASS AT A CHINESE OFFICIAL CATHEDRAL "AS A MARK OF </p><p>SOLIDARITY."  ROTA-GRAZIOSI BELIEVED A LESS HIGH-PROFILE MOVE </p><p>MIGHT BE PRC SUPPORT FOR WHAT THE POPE HAS CALLED A "CULTURAL </p><p>DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE HOLY SEE AND CHINA," ROTA-GRAZIOSI SAID </p><p>THE HOLY SEE WOULD BE HAPPY TO COLLABORATE WITH BEIJING ON </p><p>SOMETHING LIKE AN ART SHOW OF VATICAN MUSEUM PIECES, OR, MORE </p><p>AMBITIOUSLY, A SYMPOSIUM TO DISCUSS VATICAN/CHINESE HISTORY. </p><p>HE DID UNDERSCORE THAT IN THE PAST THE PRC HAD REFUSED TO </p><p>ACCEPT EVEN A SINGLE WORK OF ART FROM THE VATICAN MUSEUM AS </p><p>PART OF ANOTHER ART SHOW.  FINALLY, HE NOTED THAT IT WOULD </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  03575  191444Z </p><p>CERTAINLY HELP FOR THE U.S. DELEGATION TO URGE THE PRC TO </p><p>REOPEN ITS DIALOGUE WITH THE HOLY SEE, WHICH COULD START EVEN </p><p>VIA INFORMAL INTERMEDIARIES SUCH AS THE U.S., ITALY, SPAIN, </p><p>GERMANY, OR OTHER INTERESTED PARTIES. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) COMMENT:  ROTA-GRAZIOSI WAS SPEAKING FOR HIMSELF AND, </p><p>CHARACTERISTICALLY CAUTIOUS AS A VATICAN OFFICIAL, WAS </p><p>OBVIOUSLY NOT COMFORTABLE "BRAINSTORMING"  FOR POLOFFS.  IT </p><p>IS NOT CERTAIN THAT ARCHBISHOP CELLI WOULD ENDORSE ANY OR ALL </p><p>OF THESE IDEAS, SAVE THE LAST POINT.  THE HOLY SEE HAS </p><p>CONSISTANTLY EXPRESSED ITS APPRECIATION TO US FOR THE WORK OF </p><p>DRL/IRF AND FOR THE PRESIDENT\'S PERSONAL INTERVENTIONS ON </p><p>THIS ISSUE IN BEIJING. </p><p>HARDT </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> </p><p></p><p> 2002VATICA03575 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
