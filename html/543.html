<p>S E C R E T STATE 324006 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL:  OADR </p><p>TAGS: XT, PINR </p><p>SUBJECT:  INR ANALYSIS:  INTER-AMERICAN HIGHLIGHTS: </p><p>SEPTEMBER 30, 1992 </p><p> </p><p>SECRET/NOFORN/NOCONTRACT (NOT RELEASABLE TO FOREIGN </p><p>NATIONALS) </p><p></p><p>TABLE OF CONTENTS </p><p></p><p>PERU:  FUJIMORI GAINS STRENGTH </p><p>EL SALVADOR-HONDURAS:  SOLOMONIC BORDER RULING </p><p>NICARAGUA:  POLICE AND PROPERTY REFORMS...ALMOST </p><p>MEXICO:  LABOR PROBLEMS </p><p>ECUADOR:  ECONOMIC REFORM ADVANCES DESPITE PROTESTS </p><p> </p><p></p><p>--PERU:  FUJIMORI GAINS STRENGTH </p><p></p><p>IN THE SIX MONTHS SINCE THE APRIL 5 CIVIL-MILITARY COUP. </p><p>PRESIDENT ALBERTO FUJIMORI HAS OUTMANEUVERED THE </p><p>OPPOSITION, PLACATED THE OAS. AND WON A STUNNING VICTORY </p><p>IN THE BATTLE WITH THE SHINING PATH (SL) BY CAPTURING </p><p>ABIMAEL GUZMAN, ITS FOUNDER AND LEADER.  ALTHOUGH PERU </p><p>HAS ONE OF THE MOST STRINGENT AUSTERITY PROGRAMS IN </p><p>LATIN AMERICA. FUJIMORI.S POPULARITY RATING IS CLOSE TO </p><p>75 PERCENT IN THE WAKE OF THE SEPTEMBER 12 CAPTURE, AND </p><p>NOMINALLY INDEPENDENT PARTIES LOYAL TO THE PRESIDENT </p><p>APPEAR POISED TO WIN A MAJORITY IN THE NOVEMBER 22 </p><p>DEMOCRATIC CONSTITUENT CONGRESS (CCD) ELECTIONS. </p><p></p><p>THE NEW CONSTITUTION PROBABLY WILL STRENGTHEN THE POWERS </p><p>OF THE PRESIDENCY AND UNDERCUT THE DOMINANCE OF THE </p><p>TRADITIONAL POLITICAL PARTIES.  FUJIMORI.S AUTOCRATIC </p><p>AND SECRETIVE MODUS OPERANDI ULTIMATELY MAY UNDERMINE </p><p>HIS EFFORTS. HOWEVER.  (C) </p><p></p><p>DEAD END FOR SHINING PATH?  THE PRESIDENT\'S PLEDGE TO </p><p>WIPE OUT TERRORISM BY 1995 GAINED SUBSTANTIALLY IN </p><p>CREDIBILITY WITH GUZMAN.S ARREST\' PARTICULARLY BECAUSE </p><p>IT FOLLOWED THE JUNE CAPTURE OF MRTA LEADER VICTOR </p><p>POLAY.  GUZMAN\'S DETENTION COULD NOT HAVE COME AT A </p><p>BETTER TIME FOR FUJIMORI, IN VIEW OF THE NOVEMBER CCD </p><p>ELECTIONS.  THE EUPHORIA IN LIMA IS PALPABLE, THOUGH </p><p>ACCOMPANIED BY FEAR OF NEAR-TERM SL RETALIATION.  (C) </p><p></p><p>IT REMAINS UNCLEAR WHETHER SL CAN REGROUP UNDER NEW </p><p>LEADERSHIP.  THERE IS LITTLE REASON TO EXPECT A </p><p>SHORT-TERM COLLAPSE, BUT SL\'S LONG-TERM PROSPECTS APPEAR </p><p>DIMMER.  THE OUTCOME OF GUZMAN\'S MILITARY TRIAL IS NOT </p><p>IN DOUBT, THOUGH THE SCHEDULED OCTOBER 27 ANNOUNCEMENT </p><p>OF THE VERDICT AND SENTENCE IS LIKELY TO PROVOKE A </p><p>VIOLENT SL RESPONSE, ESPECIALLY IF FUJIMORI FINDS A WAY </p><p>TO JUSTIFY THE DEATH PENALTY.  (C) </p><p></p><p>INTERESTED PARTIES.  FUJIMORI JUST1FIED HIS APRIL 5 </p><p>DISSOLUTION OF CONGRESS PARTLY ON GROUNDS THAT AN </p><p>ANTIDEMOCRATIC "PARTYOCRACY" DEPRIVED THE PEOPLE OF </p><p>"REAL DEMOCRACY."  PROCEEDING ON THIS PREMISE, FUJIMORI </p><p>HAS TRIED TO DIFFUSE THE POWER OF THE TRADITIONAL </p><p>PARTIES. WHICH CONSTITUTE HIS MAIN OPPOSITION.  BOWING </p><p>TO PRESSURE FROM THE OAS FUJIMORI AGREED TO A NATIONAL </p><p>DIALOGUE AS A PRELUDE TO CCD ELECTIONS.  BUT THE </p><p>FRACTIOUS PARTIES LARGELY BOYCOTTED THE PROCEEDINGS. </p><p>ALLOWING THE PRESIDENT TO WRITE HIS OWN ELECTORAL </p><p>RULES.  (C) </p><p></p><p>BEFORE GUZMAN\'S CAPTURE, MOST PARTIES FEARED THAT </p><p>ENTERING THE CCD CONTESTS WOULD LEGITIMIZE A FUJIMORI </p><p>DICTATORSHIP AND HOPED THAT INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE WOULD </p><p>FORCE CONCESSIONS.  SOME OF THESE PARTIES NOW APPEAR TO </p><p>BE LEANING TOWARD PARTICIPATION IN THE ELECTIONS.  THE </p><p>POPULAR CHRISTIAN PARTY HAS OPTED TO ENTER.  EXILED </p><p>FORMER PRESIDENT GARCIA.S APRA, HOWEVER, HAS DECIDED TO </p><p>BOYCOTT. PERHAPS FEARING AN EMBARRASSINGLY POOR </p><p>SHOWING.  FORMER PRESIDENT BELAUNDE\'S POPULAR ACTION HAS </p><p>DECIDED TO FORGO THE CCD CONTESTS BUT TO RUN IN NEXT </p><p>JANUARY.S MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS.  SMALLER PARTIES ARE </p><p>GATHERING SIGNATURES OR FORMING COALITIONS TO QUALIFY </p><p>FOR REGISTRATION BY OCTOBER 8.  (C) </p><p></p><p>WHILE THE TRADITIONAL PARTIES BICKER INTERNALLY ABOUT </p><p>WHETHER TO PARTICIPATE IN THE ELECTIONS, FUJIMORI\'S </p><p>CAMPAIGN IS ALREADY UNDER WAY.  POLLS REFLECT </p><p>WIDESPREAD REJECTION OF THE TRADITIONAL PARTIES AND AN </p><p>OVERWHELMING VOTER PREFERENCE FOR NOMINALLY INDEPENDENT </p><p>CANDIDATES.  FUJIMORI IS OFFERING SUPPORTERS THREE </p><p>BRANDS OF THE SAME BASIC PRODUCT:  HIS 1990 ELECTORAL </p><p>VEHICLE CHANGE 90; THE RECENTLY FORMED NEW MAJORITY </p><p>MOVEMENT, HEADED BY HIS FORMER ENERGY MINISTER AND </p><p>CONFIDANT JAIME YOSHIYAMA; AND, ACCORDING TO A PRESS </p><p>REPORT, AN "INDEPENDENT" PARTY HEADED BY FORMER FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER CARLOS TORRES.  (C) </p><p></p><p>IF THE ELECTION WERE HELD TODAY, FUJIMORI LOYALISTS </p><p>WOULD CLEARLY WIN A MAJORITY.  ASSUMING THEY DO SO IN </p><p>NOVEMBER, THE NEW CCD PROBABLY WILL DRAFT A </p><p>CONSTITUTION TAILORMADE FOR FUJIMORI, POSSIBLY </p><p>INCLUDING NEW FROVISIONS ALLOWING FOR REELECTION OF AN </p><p>INCUMBENT PRESIDENT.  (C) </p><p></p><p>FUJIOCRACY.  FUJIMORI SEEMS TO BE GETTING AWAY WITH HIS </p><p>UNUSUAL CIVIL-MILITARY COUP.  HE CONTINUES TO ENJOY THE </p><p>SUPPORT OF THE ARMED FORCES WHICH, DESPITE SOME </p><p>RUMBLINGS IN THE RANKS, ARE PROBABLY DISINCLINED TO </p><p>TAKE POWER THEMSELVES OR RETURN IT TO THE DISCREDITED </p><p>PARTIES.  THE RECENT SACKING OF AIR FORCE COMMANDER </p><p>VELARDE UNDERSCORES FUJIMORI.S SELF-CONFIDENCE </p><p>VIS-A-VIS THE TOP BRASS.  HIS TIMETABLE AND GROUND </p><p>RULES FOR RESTORATION OF DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS HAVE </p><p>PLACATED THE OAS, AND THE PUBLIC SEEMS UNMOVED BY THE </p><p>PARTIES\' COMPLAINTS ABOUT FUJIMORI\'S MANIPULATION OF </p><p>THE PROCESS.  (C) </p><p></p><p>FUJIMORI IS MORE IN TOUCH WITH HIS PREDOMINANTLY </p><p>MESTIZO AND INDIAN COUNTRYMEN THAN THE LIMA ELITE EVER </p><p>WAS.  THE PROBLEM WITH THE "NEW PERU" UNDER </p><p>CONSTRUCTION IS THAT IT COULD BE TOO BASED ON FUJIMORI </p><p>TO OUTLAST HIM.  THE PRESIDENT REMAINS SKEPTICAL OF </p><p>INSTITUTIONS, DISTRUSTFUL OF ALL BUT A HANDFUL OF </p><p>CONFIDANTS, AND DRIVEN BY A POTENTIALLY </p><p>SELF-DESTRUCTIVE MESSIANIC ZEAL.  HE MAY WELL ATTEMPT </p><p>TO ENGINEER HIS OWN REELECTION IN 1995, THEREBY </p><p>FULFILLING HIS 1991 OFF-HAND REMARK THAT PERU "NEEDS AN </p><p>EMPEROR FOR 10 YEARS."  HIS DEPARTURE FROM THE SCENE. </p><p>WILLINGLY OR OTHERWISE, COULD LEAVE A VACUUM THAT THE </p><p>TRADITIONAL PARTIES AND ARMED FORCES WOULD VIE TO </p><p>FILL.  (C) (DRAFTED BY JAMES ALLEN) </p><p></p><p>--EL SALVADOR-HONDURAS:  SOLOMONIC BORDER RULING </p><p></p><p>THE INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE (ICJ) ON SEFTEMBER </p><p>11 RENDERED A LENGTHY AND COMPLICATED DECISION ON THE </p><p>LONGSTANDING SALVADOR-HONDURAS BORDER DISPUTE, AWARDING </p><p>ROUGHLY TWO-THIRDS OF THE LAND AREAS (BOLSONES) IN </p><p>QUESTION TO HONDURAS.  EL SALVADOR RECEIVED THE TWO </p><p>LARGEST ISLANDS IN THE GULF OF FONSECA--MEANGUERA AND </p><p>MEANGUERITA--WHILE EL TIGRE ISLAND WENT TO HONDURAS, </p><p>WHICH WAS GUARANTEED ACCESS TO THE PACIFIC.  THE ICJ </p><p>ALSO GRANTED EL SALVADOR, HONDURAS, AND NICARAGUA JOINT </p><p>SOVEREIGNTY OVER THE GULF BEYOND 3 NAUTICAL MILES FROM </p><p>THEIR RESPECTIVE SHORES.  (C) </p><p></p><p>SALVADORANS STUNNED.  PRIOR TO THE DECISION, </p><p>CONVENTIONAL WISDOM IN BOTH COUNTRIES WAS THAT </p><p>LAND-POOR EL SALVADOR WOULD BE AWARDED THE BOLSONES. </p><p>THE DECISION GIVING THE MAJOR PORTION TO HONDURAS WAS A </p><p>BITTER DISAPPOINTMENT, BUT PUBL1CLY AT LEAST MOST </p><p>SALVADORANS TRIED TO PUT THE BEST FACE ON THE OUTCOME. </p><p>PRIVATELY. THERE WERE MUTTERINGS THAT CRISTIANI HAD </p><p>FAILED TO PREPARE THE POPULATION FOR AN ADVERSE </p><p>OUTCOME  AND HIS ARENA PARTY WOULD SUFFER FOR IT.  (S) </p><p></p><p>DEMILITARIZED ZONE?  THE FMLN, MEANWHILE, CLAIMED </p><p>CRISTIANI WAS NOT SUFFICIENTLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE </p><p>BOLSONES BECAUSE THEY WERE POPULATED PRIMARILY BY "ITS" </p><p>PEOPLE.  ALTHOUGH THE DISPUTED AREAS ARE NOT HEAVILY </p><p>POPULATED (ABOUT 25,000). 10,000-15,000 ARE FMLN </p><p>SUPPORTERS OR SYMPATHIZERS WITH THEIR OWN CIVIC AND </p><p>ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS.  HAVING OPERATED INDEPENDENTLY </p><p>OF THE GOVERNMENT FOR YEARS, THESE CADRE DO NOT WELCOME </p><p>A HONDURAN PRESENCE NOW.  (S) </p><p></p><p>THE FMLN HAS PROPOSED DEMILITARIZING THE AREAS OR </p><p>TURNING THEM INTO A FREE-TRADE ZONE AND GIVING </p><p>RESIDENTS DUAL CITIZENSHIP.  THE FMLN ALSO WANTS </p><p>REPRESENTATION ON THE BINATIONAL COMMISSION ESTABLISHED </p><p>BY PRESIDENTS CRISTIANI AND CALLEJAS TO IMPLEMENT THE </p><p>ICJ DECISION AND IS REQUESTING A UN OBSERVER MISSION TO </p><p>PROTECT BOLSONES INHABITANTS FROM BOTH COUNTRIES\' </p><p>MILITARIES.  (S) </p><p></p><p>HONDURANS CAUTIOUS.  MILITARY AND CIVILIAN LEADERSHIP </p><p>BOTH APPEARED PLEASANTLY SURPRISED BY THE RULING AND </p><p>ALERT TO THE SENSITIVITY OF UPROOTING OR RELOCATING </p><p>BOLSONES RESIDENTS.  GENERAL DISCUA AND OTHERS </p><p>REPORTEDLY HAVE ADVISED CALLEJAS TO PROCEED WITH </p><p>CAUTION AND WITHOUT ARROGANCE.  NEVERTHELESS HONDURAS </p><p>IS NOT LIKELY TO ALLOW THE FMLN TO REMAIN IN CONTROL IN </p><p>HONDURAN TERRITORY.  NEITHER IS GENERAL DISCUA LIKELY </p><p>TO ACQUIESCE IN A DEMILITARIZED ZONE ON THE HONDURAN </p><p>BORDER.  BOTH COUNTRIES SAY THEY WILL RELY ON THE </p><p>BINATIONAL COMMISSION TO RESOLVE DIFFICULT HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>ISSUES.  (S) </p><p></p><p>CALLEJAS WILL LEAD A LARGE DELEGATION TO SAN SALVADOR </p><p>FOR CONSULTATIONS AT THE END OF SEPTEMBER  THUS </p><p>BEGINNING THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD OF BILATERAL </p><p>DISCUSSIONS BEFORE DEMARCATION OF THE NEW BORDERS.  THE </p><p>ICJ RULING APPARENTLY REQUIRES ALL THREE RIFARIAN </p><p>COUNTRIES--HONDURAS, EL SALVADOR, AND NICARAGUA--TO </p><p>WORK OUT ISSUES OF ACCESS AND ECONOMIC RIGHTS EXTENDING </p><p>FROM THE GULF OF FONSECA INTO THE PACIFIC.  AT THE </p><p>MOMENT, NO ONE APPEARS EAGER TO ENGAGE FORMALLY WITH </p><p>NICARAGUA ON THIS ISSUE.  (C) (DRAFTED BY VIVIAN </p><p>GILLESPIE) </p><p></p><p>--  NICARAGUA:  POLICE AND PROPERTY REFORMS...ALMOST </p><p></p><p>RECENT PERSONNEL CHANGES AND A NEW "ORGANIC" LAW APPEAR </p><p>TO MAKE ONLY SUPERFICIAL CHANGES IN THE </p><p>SANDINISTA-DOMINATED POLICE.  THE PROGRESS OF THE </p><p>CHAMORRO GOVERNMENT\'S EFFORTS IN POLICE REFORM, </p><p>INVESTIGATION OF ANTI-CONTRA VIOLENCE, AND PROPERTY </p><p>SETTLEMENT REMAINS GLACIALLY INCREMENTAL.  (C) </p><p></p><p>THE ORGANIC POLICE LAW PUBLISHED SEPTEMBER 11 SETS </p><p>TERMS OF OFFICE AND PERMITS DISMISSAL FOR CAUSE. BUT IT </p><p>ALSO ENSURES CONTINUED SANDINISTA LEADERSHIP IN TOP </p><p>JOBS BY PROMOTION FROM WITHIN.  MOREOVER, IT DOES NOT </p><p>APPEAR TO GIVE THE NEW CIVILIAN VICE MINISTER OF </p><p>GOVERNMENT. ROLAND AVILES. CONTROL OVER PERSONNEL </p><p>ASSIGNMENTS AND, HENCE. PROMOTION.  AVILES IS DESCRIBED </p><p>AS STRIDENTLY ANTI-SANDINISTA, BUT VERY CLOSE TO </p><p>PRESIDENCY MINISTER LACAYO AND MORE OF AN IMPLEMENTER </p><p>THAN AN INITIATOR.  (S) </p><p></p><p>REACTION TO POLICE CHANGES.  REACTION AMONG </p><p>NON-SANDINISTAS TO THE APPOINTMENT OF FERNANDO CALDERA </p><p>TO REPLACE RENE VIVAS AS POLICE CHIEF HAS BEEN </p><p>NEGATIVE, ACCORDING TO EMBASSY MANAGUA.  NICARAGUAN </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS DESCRIBE CALDERA AS </p><p>"DANGEROUS" AND A "COMMITTED SANDINISTA."  THE BISHOP </p><p>OF CHONTALES, WHO CLASHED WITH CALDERA IN YEARS PAST, </p><p>SAID HE WAS "AMAZED" BY THE APPOINTMENT.  THE BISHOP </p><p>AND OTHERS CITED RAMPANT HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES AND BAD </p><p>PRISON CONDITIONS UNDER CALDERA.S TENURE AS A REGIONAL </p><p>POLICE CHIEF IN THE EARLY-TO-MID 1980S.  (C) </p><p></p><p>FORMER RESISTANCE LEADER AND NOW SOCIAL CHRISTIAN </p><p>DEPUTY AZUCENA FERREY SAW ONE POSITIVE ASPECT:  THAT </p><p>FORMER SANDINISTA INTERIOR MINISTER TOMAS BORGE WAS NOW </p><p>FINISHED" IN NICARAGUA BECAUSE THOSE DISMISSED WERE </p><p>FROM HIS WING OF THE FSLN.  (C) </p><p></p><p>THE GOVERNMENT INSISTS THAT CALDERA WAS THE BEST CHOICE </p><p>OF THOSE ELIGIBLE FOR THE JOB.  CALDERA, FOR HIS FART. </p><p>HAS PLEDGED TO IMPROVE POLICE BEHAVIOR AND INVESTIGATE </p><p>THE ASSASSINATIONS OF FORMER CONTRA LEADER ENRIQUE </p><p>BERMUDEZ AND OTHERS.  (C) </p><p></p><p>ARCHBISHOP OBANDO Y BRAVO HAS AGREED IN PRINCIPAL TO </p><p>PARTICIPATE IN A TRIPARTITE COMMISSION. TOGETHER WITH </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES OF OAS/CIAV AND THE GOVERNMENT. TO LOOK </p><p>INTO KILLINGS OF MORE THAN 100 EX-CONTRAS SINCE 1990. </p><p>PLANS TO ESTABLISH THE COMMISSION FRAMEWORK APPEAR TO </p><p>BE MOVING AHEAD.  (C) </p><p></p><p>PROPERTY DECREES ANNOUNCED.  THE COMPLICATED PROCESS OF </p><p>UNTANGLING 10 YEARS OF SANDINISTA CONFISCATIONS AND </p><p>LAND REFORM IS INCHING FORWARD.  ON SEPTEMBER 9 A </p><p>DECREE SIGNED BY CHAMORRO CREATED A PROPERTY ATTORNEY </p><p>TO HEAD A THREE-PERSON NATIONAL COMMISSION TO </p><p>INVESTIGATE AND RECOMMEND RETURN OF PROPERTY OR </p><p>COMPENSATION.  THE REMAINDER OF THE PROPERTY </p><p>PACKAGE--AN OFFICE IN THE FINANCE MINISTRY TO DETERMINE </p><p>CLAIM VALUES AND TO ESTABLISH A COMPENSATION FUND AND </p><p>AN ARBITRATION MECHANISM--SHOULD BE ANNOUNCED LATER </p><p>THIS MONTH, ACCORDING TO EMBASSY MANAGUA.  THIS </p><p>APPROACH LEAVES IN SANDINISTA POSSESSION PROPERTIES </p><p>SEIZED AFTER THE ELECTION, WHILE IT OBLIGATES THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT TO PROVIDE ANY COMPENSATION DUE THE ORIGINAL </p><p>OWNERS.  (C) </p><p></p><p>THIS FAR AND NO FURTHER.  THE CHAMORRO GOVERNMENT </p><p>EVIDENTLY HOPES THE CHANGES WILL BE SUFFICIENT FOR </p><p>RELEASE OF BADLY NEEDED US ASSISTANCE.  FAILURE TO </p><p>RECEIVE THE US FUNDS PROBABLY WILL PUT NICARAGUA IN </p><p>NONCOMPLIANCE WITH ITS IMF PROGRAM AND WOULD ENDANGER </p><p>THE RELATIVELY SUCCESSFUL ECONOMIC PROGRAM.  INCENSED </p><p>BY US PRESSURES, CHAMORRO NONETHELESS HAS WARNED SHE </p><p>WILL RESIGN RATHER THAN ACCEDE TO MORE DRASTIC US </p><p>DEMANDS, AND LACAYO SHOWS NO SIGN OF WILLINGNESS TO </p><p>CONSIDER FURTHER CHANGES IN THE POLICE OR ARMY </p><p>LEADERSHIP AT THIS TIME.  (C) (DRAFTED BY VIVIAN </p><p>GILLESPIE) </p><p></p><p>--  MEXICO:  LABOR PROBLEMS </p><p></p><p>ANTICIPATION OF THE NORTH AMERICAN FREE TRADE AGREEMENT </p><p>(NAFTA) IS BRINGING A WRENCHING ADJUSTMENT TO FIRMS IN </p><p>MEXICO.  LABOR-MANAGEMENT RELATIONS ARE BEING REDEFINED </p><p>AS FIRMS SEEK TO INCREASE PRODUCTIVITY AND EFFICIENCY </p><p>BY INTRODUCING MORE FLEXIBLE WORK RULES AND NEW FORMS </p><p>OF MANUFACTURING AND INVENTORY CONTROL.  THIS OFTEN </p><p>MEANS FEWER WORKERS AND LINKING WAGE HIKES TO </p><p>PRODUCTIVITY, THREATENING THE POWER OF TRADITIONAL </p><p>UNION BOSSES ACCUSTOMED TO DISPROPORTIONATE INFLUENCE </p><p>ON COMPANY OPERATIONS.  (C) </p><p></p><p>THE NEW MEXICO.  TO INCREASE MEXICO.S ATTRACTIVENESS TO </p><p>FOREIGN INVESTORS, PRESIDENT SALINAS HAS TRIED STEADILY </p><p>TO TRIM UNION POWER YET NOT BREAK FAITH WITH THE </p><p>POWERFUL MEXICAN LABOR CONFEDERATION (CTM). A </p><p>TRADITIONAL, ALBEIT WANING, PILLAR OF THE RULING PRI </p><p>AND A MECHANISM FOR CONTROLLING LABOR.  SINCE TAKING </p><p>OFFICE, SALINAS HAS ORDERED THE ARREST OF CORRUPT UNION </p><p>OFFICIALS, PROMOTED NEW LABOR LEADERS, AND USED THE </p><p>DECENTRALIZATION OF PARASTATALS (PEMEX. FOR EXAMPLE) </p><p>AND SUCH GOVERNMENT FUNCTIONS AS EDUCATION TO WEAKEN </p><p>CORPORATIST UNION POWER.  BUT HE HAS BEEN UNWILLING TO </p><p>TAKE ON THE CTM AND ITS POWERFUL NONAGENARIAN LEADER. </p><p>FIDEL VELAZQUEZ, DIRECTLY BY ATTEMFTING TO REFORM </p><p>MEXICO.S RIGID, OUTDATED LABOR CODE.  (C) </p><p></p><p>A TURNING POINT?  THE SALINAS ADMINISTRATION SENT A </p><p>STRONG SIGNAL TO LABOR WHEN THE NATIONAL LABOR BOARD, </p><p>PROBABLY AT SALINAS\'S BEHEST, RULED ON AUGUST 17 IN </p><p>FAVOR OF VOLKSWAGEN, MEXICO\'S LARGEST CAR MAKER, IN ITS </p><p>DISPUTE WITH DISSIDENT UNIONISTS.  IN EARLY JULY THE </p><p>DISSIDENTS LED A STRIKE OF 14,000 MEMBERS OF THE </p><p>INDEPENDENT AUTO WORKERS UNION AT VW.S PUEBLA PLANT, </p><p>WHICH MAKES MEXICO\'S BEST-SELLING BEETLE, AND CARS FOR </p><p>EXPORT.  THE STRIKERS CLAIMED THE ELECTED UNION </p><p>PRESIDENT HAD SIGNED A NEW CONTRACT--ACCEPTING </p><p>PROVISIONS TYING RAISES AND PROMOTIONS TO </p><p>PRODUCTIVITY--WITHOUT VETTING IT WITH THE RANK AND </p><p>FILE.  (S) </p><p></p><p>VW RESPONDED BY VOIDING ITS OLD UNION CONTRACT. LOCKING </p><p>OUT STRIKERS, AND THREATENING TO LEAVE MEXICO--A </p><p>DEVELOPMENT THE GOVERNMENT FEARED COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE </p><p>EFFECT ON NAFTA AND POTENTIAL INVESTORS.  THE LABOR </p><p>BOARD\'S RULING WILL PERMIT THE COMPANY TO REHIRE MOST </p><p>OF THE WORKERS ON TERMS THAT ENSURE GREATER MANAGEMENT </p><p>FLEXIBILITY IN THE FUTURE.  VW REPORTEDLY PLANS TO </p><p>BRING IN 40 GERMAN AUTO PARTS MANUFACTURERS TO ALLOW IT </p><p>TO MEET NAFTA CONTENT RULES.  (S) </p><p></p><p>MEANWHILE. 20,000 TEXTILE WORKERS WENT ON A 58-DAY </p><p>STRIKE TO DEMAND HIGHER WAGES AND TO PROTEST WORK RULES </p><p>THAT MEANT FEWER JOBS.  ACCORDING TO LOCAL PRESS </p><p>REPORTS  MOST OF THE TROUBLE WAS IN NONCOMFETITIVE </p><p>FIRMS PRODUCING FOR THE DOMESTIC MARKET:  MEXICAN </p><p>EXPORT COMPANIES ARE ALREADY MAKING THE CAPITAL </p><p>INVESTMENTS NEEDED TO COMPETE UNDER NAFTA.  THE STRIKE. </p><p>WHICH WAS PUBLICLY SUPPORTED BY CTM LEADER VELAZQUEZ, </p><p>ENDED AMICABLY ON SEPTEMBER 4 WHEN GOVERNMENT. LABOR. </p><p>AND INDUSTRY LEADERS AGREED TO A 14-PERCENT WAGE HIKE </p><p>AND 50-PERCENT PAYMENT FOR LOST WAGES.  (C) </p><p></p><p>SPOKESMEN FOR THE WORKERS CLAIM THE SETTLEMENT MEANS </p><p>THE INDUSTRY-WIDE COLLECTIVE CONTRACT, WHICH EXPIRED IN </p><p>JULY, REMAINS IN FORCE.  MANY TEXTILE WORKERS HAD </p><p>PREVIOUSLY REACHED SEPARATE AGREEMENTS WITH THEIR </p><p>COMPANIES. HOWEVER; WORKERS IN MONTERREY\'S HIGHLY </p><p>AUTOMATED PLANTS RECEIVED 30-PERCENT SALARY HIKES. </p><p>MOREOVER. DESPITE THE PRI.S PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR THE </p><p>STRIKERS. THE GOVERNMENT IN PRACTICE ALLOWED THE </p><p>COLLECTIVE LABOR LAW TO BE IGNORED. THEREBY SETTING A </p><p>PRECEDENT FOR RESOLVING FUTURE LABOR CONFLICTS.  THIS </p><p>SETTLEMENT, LIKE THE ONE AT VOLKSWAGEN, REPRESENTS A </p><p>VICTORY FOR MANAGEMENT.  (C) </p><p></p><p>NO PAIN, NO GAIN.  EXPANDED TRADE SHOULD INCREASE REAL </p><p>WAGES FOR MOST MEXICAN WORKERS, BUT MANY OTHERS FACE </p><p>DISLOCATION AS COMPANIES RESTRUCTURE OR FOLD.  LABOR </p><p>ACTIVISTS IN THREATENED AREAS SAY BUSINESSES ARE USING </p><p>NAFTA AS A PRETEXT TO WEAKEN THE UNIONS, INCREASING THE </p><p>POTENTIAL FOR LABOR-MANAGEMENT CONFLICT IN THE SHORT TO </p><p>MEDIUM TERM.  GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS ARE WELL AWARE THAT </p><p>ONE DOWNSIDE OF NAFTA IS THAT AS LABOR POWER BECOMES </p><p>LESS CENTRALIZED. IT WILL BE MORE DIFFICULT TO CONTROL </p><p>THE UNIONS THROUGH TRADITIONAL POLITICAL PAYOFFS, AND </p><p>LABOR\'S LOYALTY TO THE PRI MAY BE IMPERILED.  (S) </p><p>(DRAFTED BY ANGELO IOFREDDA) </p><p></p><p>--  ECUADOR:  ECONOMIC REFORM ADVANCES DESPITE PROTESTS </p><p></p><p>THE NEW PRESIDENT OF ECUADOR, FREE MARKET PROPONENT </p><p>SIXTO DURAN, IS IMPLEMENTING A SERIES OF SPENDING CUTS </p><p>AS THE FIRST STAGE OF A COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM TO </p><p>LIBERALIZE AN ECONOMY MIRED IN RECESSION.  (C) </p><p></p><p>AUSTERITY NOW, LIBERALIZATION SOON.  AS HE PROMISED AT </p><p>HIS INAUGURATION. DURAN THIS MONTH OUTLINED A REFORM </p><p>PROGRAM INTENDED TO REVERSE SHARP ECONOMIC DECLINE. </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT DEVALUED THE SUCRE BY 28 PERCENT AND </p><p>RAISED THE SUBSIDIZED PRICES OF GASOLINE BY 125 PERCENT </p><p>AND ELECTRICITY BY AS MUCH AS 120 PERCENT.  DURAN PLANS </p><p>TO CUT GOVERNMENT SPENDING BY 4 PERCENT ACROSS THE </p><p>BOARD, AND ALREADY HAS OBTAINED ASSURANCES FROM </p><p>COMMANDERS THAT THEY WILL NOT OPPOSE SIMILAR CUTS IN </p><p>THE MILITARY.  TO FORESTALL POPULAR UNREST, THE </p><p>PRESIDENT HAS FROZEN PUBLIC TRANSPORT PRICES AND </p><p>PROMISED WAGE INCREASES.  AT THE SAME TIME, ECUADOR </p><p>WILL LOWER TRADE BARRIERS WITH COLOMBIA. BOLIVIA. AND </p><p>VENEZUELA.  (C) </p><p></p><p>DURAN INTENDS TO FOLLOW THIS INITIAL ROUND OF MEASURES </p><p>BY FREEING INTEREST RATES AND SUBMITTING TO CONGRESS </p><p>BILLS ON CAPITAL MARKET REFORM AND PRIVATIZATION.  THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT PLANS TO BEGIN PRIVATIZING THE HUGE STATE </p><p>SECTOR BY FIRST LEGALIZING PRIVATE COMPETITION TO </p><p>GOVERNMENT MONOPOLIES AND THEN SELLING ITS HOLDINGS IN </p><p>PRIVATE CORPORATIONS.  UNDER THIS CAUTIOUS APPROACH, </p><p>THE PRIVATIZATION OF LARGE STATE COMPANIES WILL </p><p>FOLLOW.  (C) </p><p></p><p>ECONOMY IN DOLDRUMS.  DURAN.S IMMEDIATE PRIORITY IS TO </p><p>REDUCE INFLATION BY CUTTING EXPENDITURES AND INCREASING </p><p>TAX REVENUES.  DURAN\'S TEAM OF FREE MARKETEERS IS </p><p>HEADED BY HIS VICE PRESIDENT. PRINCETON-EDUCATED </p><p></p><p>LIBERALIZATION LED THE OPPOSITION TO CALL HIM  AN </p><p>"ECONOMIC TERRORIST."  EIGHT OF 14 CABINET MEMBERS ARE </p><p>BUSINESS EXECUTIVES, INCLUDING THE MINISTERS OF </p><p>FINANCE. INDUSTRY. AND ENERGY.  (C) </p><p></p><p>DURAN INHERITED AN ECONOMY BESET BY STAGNATION, </p><p>50-PERCENT INFLATION, A BUDGET DEFICIT OF 7 PERCENT OF </p><p>GDF AND OVERRELIANCE ON OIL INCOME.  OIL NOW ACCOUNTS </p><p>FOR HALF OF GOVERNMENT INCOME AND 40 PERCENT OF </p><p>EXPORTS. BUT RESERVES ARE EXPECTED TO BE DEPLETED </p><p>WITHIN 12 YEARS.  NEGOTIATIONS WITH CREDITORS ON </p><p>ECUADOR.S ALMOST US DOLS 13 BILLION FOREIGN DEBT ARE </p><p>STALLED.  UNDEREMFLOYMENT IS ESTIMATED AT 50 PERCENT. </p><p>DEMAND FOR LABOR IS HELD DOWN BY A LABOR CODE OF MORE </p><p>THAN 600 ARTICLES THAT REGULATES ALMOST EVERY ASPECT OF </p><p>EMPLOYMENT  EFFECTIVELY PROHIBITING MANAGEMENT FROM </p><p>FIRING OR LAYING OFF WORKERS.  CONGRESS REFORMED THE </p><p>CODE SLIGHTLY LAST YEAR, BUT MANAGERS STILL REGARD </p><p>HIRING NEW WORKERS AS A LAST RESORT.  (C) </p><p></p><p>WEAK PROTESTS AGAINST REFORM.  THE LARGEST LABOR GROUP, </p><p>THE UNITED WORKERS FRONT, THREATENED TO CALL FOR </p><p>NATIONWIDE CIVIL UNREST IF THE PRESIDENT WENT AHEAD </p><p>WITH HIS PLANS, AND THE HEAD OF THE PUBLIC EMFLOYEES </p><p>UNION LABELED THE REFORMS "NEFARIOUS."  PROPAGANDA </p><p>SUPFORTING PERU.S SENDERO LUMINOSO TERRORISTS HAS NOW </p><p>APPEARED IN SEVERAL CITIES   ANTICIPATING A REACTION TO </p><p>HIS SEPTEMBER 4 ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE AUSTERITY PACKAGE. </p><p>THE PRESIDENT AUTHORIZED DEPLOYMENT OF THE ARMED </p><p>FORCES, AND TROOPS WERE ORDERED INTO THE STREETS ON </p><p>SEPTEMBER 7 AFTER FOUR SMALL BOMBS EXPLODED AT </p><p>GOVERNMENT BUILDINGS.  (C) </p><p></p><p>SO FAR THE PROTESTS HAVE HAD NO EFFECT.  A RESOUNDING </p><p>REJECTION BY THE ELECTORATE OF THE FAILED STATIST </p><p>POLICIES OF THE PAST HAS GIVEN THE DURAN ADMINISTRATION </p><p>A CLEAR MANDATE TO IMFLEMENT ITS SWIFT AND FAR-REACHING </p><p>ECONOMIC REFORM AGENDA.  IN THE FIRST ROUND OF </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL BALLOTING, DURAN AND HIS LIKE-MINDED CHIEF </p><p>OPPONENT RECEIVED 55 PERCENT OF THE VOTE  AND THE THREE </p><p>CENTER-RIGHT PARTIES IN COALITION WITH THE NEW </p><p>PRESIDENT HOLD 39 OF THE 77 SEATS IN THE UNICAMERAL </p><p>LEGISLATURE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(C) (DRAFTED BY MICHAEL ZAK) KANTER </p><p></p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
