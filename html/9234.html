<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 001190 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR E. MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  07-08-13 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PTER, CE, Political Parties </p><p>SUBJECT:  President\'s party weighs in on Tigers, GSL, </p><p>and alliance with left-wingers </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  Colombo 1143, and previous </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Donald Camp, Charge d\'Affaires. </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b, d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  In the wake of the June Tokyo donors </p><p>conference, Sri Lankan President Chandrika Bandaranaike </p><p>Kumaratunga, and her People\'s Alliance (PA) party, have </p><p>been relatively quiet in their attacks on Prime Minister </p><p>Ranil Wickremesinghe and his government\'s ruling United </p><p>National Party (UNP).  In recent meetings with Charge, </p><p>key presidential advisors and high-ranking PA members </p><p>discussed the PA\'s mounting distrust of the Tigers, the </p><p>president\'s continuing uneasy cohabitation relationship </p><p>with the PM, and their commitment to an alliance with a </p><p>radical, left-wing Sinhala chauvinist party.  Perhaps </p><p>reflecting the general popularity of the peace process, </p><p>the PA members were all clear that a (potential) change </p><p>in government would not mean a breakdown in talks, at </p><p>least from their side.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>PA WARINESS OF THE TIGERS </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) The most vocal interlocutor against the actions </p><p>of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) was key </p><p>presidential advisor Lakshman Kadirgamar who met with </p><p>Charge on June 27.  Kadirgamar characterized the recent </p><p>sidelining of LTTE theoretician Anton Balasingham as </p><p>noteworthy, with LTTE leader V. Prabhakaran\'s higher </p><p>visibility correlating to a more hardline approach. </p><p>(Note:  Just prior to the Tokyo conference, Balasingham </p><p>abruptly cut short his trip to the Wanni, a move seen as </p><p>suggesting that Prabhakaran was changing negotiating </p><p>tack.)  In separate meetings with Charge, Opposition </p><p>Leader Mahinda Rajapakse and Anura Bandaranaike </p><p>(President Kumaratunga\'s brother) were also harshly </p><p>critical of the LTTE\'s belligerent attitude and </p><p>continual rejection of each and every government offer </p><p>of an interim administration.  Rajapakse said the Tigers </p><p>were also destroying any public softening of attitudes </p><p>toward them with the recent killings of anti-LTTE Tamil </p><p>politicians. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) (Note:  Bandaranaike stated, however, that the </p><p>president maintains an informal mid-level dialogue with </p><p>the LTTE through intermediaries.  Through them, she has </p><p>assured the Tigers of her intent to continue the peace </p><p>process, regardless of who is in government.) </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>COHABITATION REMAINS FRAGILE </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Kadirgamar and Bandaranaike highlighted the </p><p>tense cohabitation situation.  They acknowledged the </p><p>prime minister\'s efforts to engage the Tigers in the </p><p>peace process, even speaking of the president\'s support </p><p>for the government\'s interim administration proposals. </p><p>In the next breath, however, each complained about the </p><p>PM\'s lack of consultation -- on the peace process, on </p><p>ministry issues -- with the president.  While the </p><p>president knew working with the prime minister was </p><p>essential, especially re the peace process, Kadirgamar </p><p>stated that cohabitation was not really working and </p><p>Bandaranaike reminded us of his sister\'s strong dislike </p><p>for the PM.  Kadirgamar added that it was a long- </p><p>standing request of the PA to be included in the peace </p><p>talks.  Rajapakse said that the president\'s non- </p><p>consultative move to take over the Development Lotteries </p><p>Board was retaliation against the PM for his absence of </p><p>consultation with her. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>COMMITMENT TO AN ALLIANCE WITH JVP </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) For months, the media has been detailing the </p><p>impending linkup between the PA and the left-wing, </p><p>Sinhala chauvanist Janantha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP). </p><p>Reports focus on the unresolved differences between the </p><p>two as dates for the final inking of the deal are </p><p>regularly announced, passed, and then rescheduled weeks </p><p>later.  All the PA interlocutors, however, consistently </p><p>told us the differences are being worked out and the </p><p>alliance will be signed.  Anura said such an alliance </p><p>was a matter of survival for both parties.  The growing </p><p>electoral strength of the JVP has made them attractive </p><p>to the PA, especially in the latter\'s desire to regain </p><p>control of parliament.  Still, snap elections following </p><p>any alliance do not seem likely.  Bandaranaike opined </p><p>that his sister would call for general elections before </p><p>the scheduled April 2004 provincial council elections, </p><p>reasoning that the new PA-JVP alliance would win the </p><p>general election and, therefore, the provincial one as </p><p>well. Bandaranaike dismissed the risk of losing PA </p><p>supporters over such an alliance, stating his party </p><p>followers had greater disillusionment with the current </p><p>UNP government than with the JVP. </p><p>6.  (C) Both Bandaranaike and Rajapakse claimed the JVP </p><p>had changed its opposition to the peace process, </p><p>although Bandaranaike indicated a presidential warning </p><p>to walk away from the proposed alliance may have helped </p><p>them change their minds.  Calling the current JVP </p><p>"mainstream," Kadirgamar characterized the change in </p><p>dealing with the JVP as "democracy at work." </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Original differences between the parties related </p><p>to the JVP\'s aversion to the peace process and </p><p>unwillingness to accept any "devolution" of power to the </p><p>LTTE.  At the moment, the sticking points seem to be </p><p>over the logistics of power sharing, both within the PA </p><p>and between the two parties.  The JVP reportedly has </p><p>blamed political jockeying within the PA for the hold up </p><p>in finalizing the alliance.  Rajapakse, for his part, </p><p>stated that his position in the party had not changed </p><p>and he remains senior vice president.  When pressed on </p><p>the issue, he did all but admit that the president was </p><p>using the alliance to ensure a political future for her </p><p>brother, Anura Bandaranaike.  (Note:  Bandaranaike is </p><p>arguably vying with Rajapakse for control within the </p><p>president\'s Sri Lankan Freedom Party, the main faction </p><p>of the PA.) </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) COMMENT:  With the constant guessing as to the </p><p>PA\'s future moves, it was telling that all three </p><p>interlocutors had similar messages, perhaps indicating a </p><p>rough unity at the top.  While roundly critical of the </p><p>Tigers, no one offered a different approach for working </p><p>with the group or suggested alternatives to the PM\'s </p><p>peace process efforts.  Each interlocutor focused </p><p>negatively on the lack of consultation and congenial </p><p>working relationship between the president and prime </p><p>minister, instead of specific deficiencies in the </p><p>government.  Rather than working on the poor </p><p>cohabitation relationship, the president may only be </p><p>waiting for the finalized alliance with the JVP to set </p><p>the stage for eventual election.  For the moment, </p><p>however, the party appears committed to the peace </p><p>process and not poised to make any sudden changes within </p><p>in the government. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>CAMP </p><p></p></div>
