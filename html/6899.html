<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 HANOI 000785 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, IZ, VM </p><p>SUBJECT: DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER ON IRAQ, RELATIONS WITH U.S. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED - PROTECT ACCORDINGLY </p><p> </p><p>REF: A.  02 Hanoi 3023   B. Hanoi 702   C. Hanoi 0567 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary.  Over an informal dinner on March 27, Deputy </p><p>Foreign Minister Le Van Bang and the Ambassador discussed </p><p>differences over Iraq and their effect on the bilateral </p><p>relationship.  They also explored ways to move the relationship </p><p>forward, including a series of high level visits, a possible </p><p>government/private sector conference in August, and GVN outreach </p><p>efforts within the U.S. overseas Vietnamese communities.  A long- </p><p>time proponent of improving U.S.-Vietnam relations, Bang was ever </p><p>the optimist about the future of the relationship and the need to </p><p>separate policy disagreements from a thriving trade relationship. </p><p>Bang and the Ambassador agreed, however, that continued harsh GVN </p><p>rhetoric on Iraq and a long war there could well slow down the </p><p>growth of relations.  Given the enduring "special" Vietnam-Iraq </p><p>relationship, however, it is unlikely that the GVN will temper </p><p>its criticism over Iraq any time soon.  Assistant Foreign </p><p>Minister Nguyen Duc Hung and the DCM also attended the dinner. </p><p>End summary. </p><p> </p><p>Iraq </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Candid discussion on GVN statements on Iraq dominated </p><p>much of the conversation.  The Ambassador informed Bang that </p><p>Washington was concerned about the harsh and sometimes insulting </p><p>language of GVN statements and editorials on Iraq.  He warned </p><p>Bang that if it continued much beyond this week, it would </p><p>inevitably affect the nature of the bilateral relationship. </p><p>Vietnam could even be grouped with countries in disfavor with the </p><p>USG, and that could affect USG programs here. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) The Ambassador also noted a series of actions by GVN </p><p>officials to limit or postpone contact with American officials </p><p>and programs.  One of the most disturbing, he noted, was the </p><p>possible snubbing of the American Chamber of Commerce at a major </p><p>business conference organized by the Office of the Prime Minister </p><p>in HCMC this week.  There, a senior GVN official apparently told </p><p>the president of AmCham HCMC that he needed to at least mention </p><p>the Iraq situation in his speech, since many in the audience "did </p><p>not think AmCham or an American should speak" because of the war. </p><p>The private citizen American was understandably confused about a </p><p>political quid pro quo at a speaking engagement.  The Ambassador </p><p>noted how foolish it was for the GVN to mix disagreement over </p><p>Iraq policy with business in ways that could discourage Americans </p><p>from investing and trading here. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Citing other examples of recent official GVN coolness </p><p>toward us, the Ambassador told Bang that previously confirmed </p><p>appointments with the Justice Minister and with provincial </p><p>officials in Quang Nam and Quang Ngai had been cancelled at the </p><p>last minute, apparently because of U.S. policy toward Iraq.  The </p><p>DCM noted that a group of GVN environmental officials cancelled </p><p>their IVG visit to the States at the last minute, apparently </p><p>because of Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Bang recalled that he had informed the Ambassador </p><p>several weeks ago that the GVN would cancel visits for a short </p><p>time if the U.S. started military operations in Iraq.  He </p><p>admitted that he was aware of the Ambassador\'s planned trip to </p><p>Quang Ngai and Quang Nam, and that the GVN had decided it was not </p><p>appropriate for provincial officials to meet with the Ambassador </p><p>at this time because of Iraq.  Bang also agreed that it was </p><p>unwise to let disagreement on Iraq affect the overall </p><p>business/commercial relationship, and stressed that both </p><p>countries should continue efforts to make it grow.   He stressed </p><p>that in the long run Iraq should not negatively affect the </p><p>expansion of U.S.-Vietnam relations. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) In a stretch of logic that neither the Ambassador nor </p><p>DCM could understand, Bang then attempted to explain why GVN </p><p>statements on Iraq were actually milder than they could have </p><p>been.  He claimed that GVN statements had referred to "U.S. </p><p>authorities" (meaning a group of people) rather than the U.S. </p><p>government as a whole, which would be considered much worse in a </p><p>Vietnamese context.  (The actual translation is "powerholders," </p><p>not "authorities -- ref b.)  He stated several times that there </p><p>were those in the government who did not want Iraq to affect the </p><p>relationship, but that veterans in senior positions were calling </p><p>for tough statements.   Some people even wanted to go to Iraq to </p><p>fight.  They were the ones driving the policy at the moment. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) Another concern for the GVN, according to Bang, were </p><p>the demonstrators who spontaneously formed in front of the </p><p>embassy every day.  They were, he claimed, "not under control" </p><p>and were reflecting popular opinion.  Assistant Minister Hung </p><p>asserted that the GVN could not control them and was worried that </p><p>they might resort to violence at some point. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) Without quite saying, "Let\'s get real, folks," the </p><p>Ambassador pointed out that government television trucks appeared </p><p>well before the demonstrators did, that demonstrators told the </p><p>embassy they had received about $1 to participate, and that the </p><p>GVN had proved itself quite adept at arresting those who were </p><p>peacefully expressing their views on human rights or democracy. </p><p>The Ambassador said that in any event he was not concerned about </p><p>the demonstrators because the U.S. believed in the peaceful </p><p>expression of opinion.  The concern of the USG, he emphasized, </p><p>was over the harsh tone of the official commentaries -- by Party </p><p>organs or the Government -- on the war, the cancelled meetings, </p><p>and their potential for affecting the relationship if they </p><p>continued much beyond this week.  Later in the conversation, Bang </p><p>acknowledged that universities and veteran groups had organized </p><p>many of the demonstrations. </p><p> </p><p>Moving the Relationship Forward - Visits and the Human Rights Act </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) The Deputy Minister and the Ambassador talked at length </p><p>about ways to move the relationship forward.  Bang raised the </p><p>timing of upcoming visits to the U.S. by Deputy Prime Minister </p><p>Vu Khoan and Prime Minister Phan Van Khai.   He proposed </p><p>June/July for Khoan, but observed that the war in Iraq would have </p><p>to be over by then.  The Ambassador suggested informally that </p><p>September/October might be a good time for the Prime Minister to </p><p>visit (since it was more than a year before the next U.S. general </p><p>election).  The Ambassador also noted that both sides needed to </p><p>pin down a date for the visit of the Defense Minister. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U) Bang suggested a new idea to highlight the developing </p><p>relationship.  He proposed holding a symposium on the bilateral </p><p>relationship in Hai Phong or Ha Long Bay in the first week of </p><p>August, which would be attended by government officials (Bang </p><p>suggested DAS Matt Daley and the Ambassador from the U.S. side), </p><p>businesspeople and NGO representatives.  The Ford Foundation had </p><p>agreed to fund the symposium and it would be co-organized by the </p><p>Foreign Ministry\'s Institute for International Relations (IIR) </p><p>and an American counterpart, possibly the Asia Foundation. </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU) To no one\'s surprise, Bang raised the likelihood of the </p><p>introduction of a Vietnam Human Rights Act in Congress, a move </p><p>that "would again affect the bilateral relationship in a very </p><p>negative way."  With that as his cue, the Ambassador spelled out </p><p>for Bang the recent series of unhelpful GVN actions to arrest or </p><p>detain a number of prominent Vietnamese for doing nothing more </p><p>than peacefully expressing their views on human rights and other </p><p>topics.  Among those he mentioned were Nguyen Dan Que, Le Chi </p><p>Quang, Tran Khue, Phan Que Duong, and Father Ly.  With shrugs of </p><p>apparent frustration, both Bang and Hung lamely asserted that </p><p>they had violated the law and, in case of Que, had been </p><p>communicating with U.S.-based groups to "oppose" the GVN. </p><p>Bang did agree that the timing of Que\'s arrest could not have </p><p>been worse. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (SBU)  The Ambassador informed Bang that the U.S. Mission in </p><p>Vietnam would grow as the relationship broadened and expanded. </p><p>He reminded Bang that the Embassy had been waiting more than a </p><p>month for an appointment to discuss pending visas for staff </p><p>assigned to new positions in Hanoi and HCMC.  While agreeing in </p><p>principle that the U.S. Mission should and could grow, Bang said </p><p>that that was not likely to happen until the Department </p><p>considered the longstanding GVN request for its UN Mission to </p><p>issue visas.  Bang said he wanted two employees at Vietnam\'s UN </p><p>Mission to be authorized to issue visas.  The Ambassador pointed </p><p>out that the USG also had a longstanding, unanswered consular </p><p>issue concerning its request for the GVN to broaden ConGen HCMC\'s </p><p>consular district in the south.  (Topic covered in full septel.) </p><p> </p><p>Outreach to the Viet Kieu - Will Reconciliation Take Generations? </p><p>----- --------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  (SBU) The discussion then turned to national reconciliation </p><p>and to the overseas Vietnamese communities in the U.S. (the Viet </p><p>Kieu).  Bang observed that while the Viet Kieu who actively </p><p>opposed the GVN were few in number, they had considerable </p><p>influence with certain Members of Congress.  As a former </p><p>ambassador to the U.S., he admitted that the Vietnamese Embassy </p><p>in Washington lacked an effective outreach program to the Viet </p><p>Kieu, a situation that, he said, stemmed from a lack of depth, </p><p>training and experience within the Vietnamese Foreign Service. </p><p>He agreed that the GVN needed to do more to promote </p><p>reconciliation with the overseas Vietnamese and said that he </p><p>would explore ways to assign someone to Washington with the right </p><p>mix of experience, language, interpersonal, and cultural skills. </p><p>He joked that he might go back for a tour to see his "old </p><p>friends" in the Vietnamese community in the U.S. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (SBU) The Ambassador emphasized to Bang the importance of </p><p>reconciling with the GVN\'s overseas Vietnamese detractors.  He </p><p>pointed out that many are very influential and told Bang that Dr. </p><p>Que\'s brother was present during his call on Virginia Senator </p><p>George Allen before he arrived in Vietnam.  The Ambassador </p><p>recounted a rather unpleasant exchange with Deputy Prime Minister </p><p>Nguyen Tan Dung a few weeks ago when he suggested to Dung that it </p><p>would help reconciliation if the GVN invited former South </p><p>Vietnamese leaders like ex-president Nguyen Cao Ky to return for </p><p>a visit (ref c).  At the suggestion, Dung\'s face, he said, </p><p>suddenly grew serious and the DPM almos exploded with anger. </p><p>With this attitude, the Ambassador told Bang (and Dung), </p><p>reconciliation would take generations.  Bang replied that the </p><p>Ambassador might have better luck in raising the suggestion with </p><p>Deputy Prime Minister Vu Khoan, Foreign Minister Nguyen Dy Nien, </p><p>former Deputy Prime Minister Nguyen Man Cam, than with former </p><p>military or security men like DPM Dung. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>15.  (SBU) Despite Bang\'s continuing optimism and proactive </p><p>approach to U.S. policy, the GVN is unlikely to heed our warning </p><p>to temper its troublesome language on Iraq any time soon.  The </p><p>GVN frequently highlights its pre-1975 "special" relationship </p><p>with Iraq, and those in the GVN and party leadership with wartime </p><p>experience and suspicion of the U.S. remain influential. </p><p>Nonetheless, the fact that two senior MFA officials agreed to </p><p>meet and talk with us informally and candidly is encouraging. </p><p>The dinner meeting, which Bang hosted, was obviously intended to </p><p>show that Vietnam\'s relationship with the U.S. remains important. </p><p>Despite deep disagreement over Iraq, we will continue to pursue </p><p>our programs here and our efforts to expand the relationship in </p><p>areas that serve our interests. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p></p></div>
