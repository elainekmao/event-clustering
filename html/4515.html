<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 008633 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CENTCOM AND EUCOM: PLEASE PASS TO POLADS AND J-5 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/22/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PINS, ECON, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: CODEL HASTERT\'S MEETINGS IN ANKARA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador W. Robert Pearson.  Reason: 1.5 </p><p>(b,d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: A codel led by Speaker Hastert met Nov. 21 </p><p>with P.M. Gul and Parliament President ("Speaker") Arinc. </p><p>Speaker Hastert congratulated Gul on AK\'s landslide election </p><p>victory and Turkey\'s recent progress on political and </p><p>economic reform.  Gul echoed AK leader Erdogan\'s commitment </p><p>to EU-related political reform; pledged continued progess on </p><p>economic reform; emphasized the importance of the recent UN </p><p>resolution on Iraq; and stressed that the AK government will </p><p>work constructively on Cyprus.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) In separate meetings Nov. 21 with P.M. Gul and </p><p>Parliament Speaker Arinc, Speaker Hastert congratulated the </p><p>AK (Justice and Development) Party on its overwhelming </p><p>victory in the Nov. 3 national elections.  Complementing </p><p>Turkey\'s efforts at improving its human rights record, and </p><p>its role as a model of stability in the region, Speaker </p><p>Hastert underscored the House of Representatives\' commitment </p><p>as an advocate for Turkey\'s EU membership.  Hastert further </p><p>underlined the importance of maintaining discipline on the </p><p>IMF-backed economic reform program and indicated that the </p><p>House is likely to take up QIZ legislation next year. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Both Gul and Arinc thanked the Speaker\'s delegation </p><p>for the USG\'s efforts to promote Turkey\'s EU accession bid. </p><p>They acknowledged that with a single-party government, Turkey </p><p>will be a more politically stable yet dynamic strategic </p><p>partner.  (Note: Arinc repeatedly referred to his </p><p>consitutional yet largely ceremonial capacity as Acting </p><p>President -- with President Sezer abroad at the Prague NATO </p><p>summit that day.  He also held the meeting in Presidential </p><p>Palace, primarily to assert the prerogatives of the </p><p>popularly-elected Parliament over an Executive that </p><p>reportedly tried to interfere in his election as TGNA Speaker </p><p>-- septel.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Claiming that future historians will look back on the </p><p>current period as "a turning point for Turkey," Gul laid out </p><p>the government\'s critical issues: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- EU membership: The AK government will continue to push for </p><p>EU reforms, not so much to meet the Copenhagen criteria as to </p><p>"put its own house in order."  (Arinc asserted that the new </p><p>government will be "aggressive" in its pursuit of EU </p><p>membership.)  Individual freedoms -- in every field </p><p>including, Gul noted, religion -- should be "guaranteed."  He </p><p>claimed many laws related to Turkey\'s EU aspirations will be </p><p>adopted in the run-up to December\'s crucial EU summit in </p><p>Copenhagen.  Nevertheless, Gul averred that some EU members </p><p>did not seem as sincere as the U.S. in its efforts to promote </p><p>Turkey\'s candidacy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Iraq: Gul explained that "just because Turkey is Muslim </p><p>doesn\'t mean we will support Saddam."  The recent UN </p><p>resolution is very important, and Iraq should be scutinized </p><p>to the fullest. (Arinc later echoed this sentiment.)  The new </p><p>government recognizes that Saddam has used weapons of mass </p><p>destruction in the past -- though Gul admitted he had not yet </p><p>been briefed by military or intelligence officials on Iraq. </p><p>He expects he will be better informed after this week\'s vote </p><p>of confidence in Parliament.  Gul assured Speaker Hastert </p><p>that ONW will be renewed again in the coming weeks. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Cyprus: Turkey must work to change the perception that it </p><p>does not want to solve the problem.  Gul said his </p><p>administration would work "in a positive way" to bring about </p><p>a solution.  (Arinc lightly admonished the Hastert delegation </p><p>for the Senate\'s (sic) passing of a resolution endorsing </p><p>"Greek Cypriot" accession to the EU, and intimated that </p><p>further "biased" actions would be detrimental to finding a </p><p>peaceful solution.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Economic reform: Gul underscored his government\'s </p><p>commitment to cooperation with the World Bank and IMF and to </p><p>fiscal discipline.  Pointing out that AK will "never be </p><p>populist on economic reform," Gul nevertheless admitted that </p><p>Turkey "would need help" from the USG  in continuing the </p><p>reform program. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Comment: The Speaker\'s delegation presented a useful </p><p>opportunity for Washington leadership to engage the new AK </p><p>Party-led Turkish Government directly at the highest levels. </p><p>The Speaker reviewed a number of our essential issues and </p><p>evoked useful replies on the direction of the new leadership. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
