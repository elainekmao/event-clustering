<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 001898 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>CENTCOM FOR POLAD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/30/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, EPET, ETRD, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZ01: INFOMIN: SEVEN OIL TRUCKS GO TO IRAQ, </p><p>RETURN EMPTY; JORDAN WILL NOT RESUME IRAQI CRUDE IMPORTS </p><p> </p><p>REF: AMMAN 1881 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: PolCouns Doug Silliman for reasons 1.5 (B)(D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  Information Minister Mohammad Adwan told the </p><p>Ambassador March 30 that, contrary to information reported in </p><p>ref conversation with Foreign Minister Marwan Muasher, the </p><p>GOJ had in fact sent seven oil tanker trucks to al-Qaem in </p><p>Iraq (near H-1) to take delivery of some Iraqi oil.  The </p><p>trucks had returned empty.  According to Adwan, the Iraqi </p><p>official in charge of the oil terminal at al-Qaem had told </p><p>the drivers that he had no "license" to give any more crude </p><p>oil to Jordan. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  Adwan said that the exercise was "a publicity stunt" </p><p>to disprove Iraqi VP Taha Yassin Ramadan\'s accusatory </p><p>statement last week that Jordan had shut off Iraqi oil </p><p>shipments.  Jordan, he confirmed, has no intention of </p><p>resuming shipments of Iraqi oil.  Adwan said he was pleased </p><p>that, should Iraqi officials again publicly criticize Jordan </p><p>over oil or trade issues, Jordan would be able to respond </p><p>that it was Iraq, not Jordan, that had shut down oil trade. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  COMMENT:  The Ambassador castigated Adwan about the </p><p>serious damage this "publicity stunt" could have caused to </p><p>U.S.-Jordanian relations if something had gone wrong. </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
