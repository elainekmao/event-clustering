(U) CLASSIFIED BY CHARGE D\'AFFAIRES DENNIS HARTER. </p><p> REASON:  1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) BEGIN SUMMARY:  AMB. PETERSON CALLED ON FM </p><p>NGUYEN DY NIEN JUNE 9 PRIOR TO THE FORMER\'S DEPARTURE </p><p>FOR WASHINGTON.  NIEN HOPED THAT JACKSON-VANIK WAIVERS </p><p>WOULD NO LONGER BE NECESSARY IN THE FUTURE AND THAT THE </p><p>USG WOULD TAKE A MORE "FLEXIBLE" STANCE ON THE BTA. </p><p>AMB. PETERSON SAID THE POLITICAL CLIMATE IN WASHINGTON </p><p>MADE IT HIGHLY UNLIKELY THE ANNUAL JACKSON-VANIK REVIEW </p><p>WOULD BE ELIMINATED ANY TIME SOON.  HE TOLD NIEN THAT </p><p>IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR HANOI TO SHELVE THE BTA UNTIL </p><p>VIETNAM WAS READY RATHER THAN TO CONTINUE TO INSIST </p><p>UNREALISTICALLY ON RENEGOTIATION OR CONCESSIONS. NIEN </p><p>EXPRESSED HANOI\'S ANNOYANCE WITH RECENT CONGRESSIONAL </p><p>RESOLUTIONS ATTACKING VIETNAM AND REPEATED HIS </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S REQUEST FOR U.S. AID FOR AGENT ORANGE </p><p>VICTIMS.  AMB. PETERSON EXPLAINED THE DIVISION OF </p><p>POWERS IN THE USG, STRESSED THE NEED TO FORGE AHEAD ON </p><p>ALL ISSUES AND REITERATED OUR OFFER TO WORK JOINTLY </p><p>WITH VIETNAMESE SCIENTISTS ON SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH ON </p><p>AGENT ORANGE.  THE AMBASSADOR URGED NIEN TO REVERSE HIS </p><p>MINISTRY\'S RECENT ACTIONS TO TRY TO RESTRICT EMBASSY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  01316  01 OF 03  150821Z </p><p>ACTIVITIES.  TYPICALLY, NIEN WAS MAINLY IN A LISTENING </p><p>MODE.  REGULAR EXCHANGES ARE NONETHELESS USEFUL IN </p><p>GETTING OUR MESSAGE TO THE SENIOR LEVELS OF THE GVN. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) AMBASSADOR PETERSON CALLED ON FM NGUYEN DY NIEN </p><p>JUNE 9 TO REVIEW THE STATE OF BILATERAL RELATIONS PRIOR </p><p>TO THE FORMER\'S TRIP TO WASHINGTON TO DEAL WITH THE </p><p>JACKSON-VANIK WAIVER VOTE AND OTHER ISSUES.  THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR SAID THAT HE WANTED TO SEE NIEN IN ORDER TO </p><p>LET HIM KNOW THAT HE WOULD BE FOCUSING PRIMARILY ON TWO </p><p>EVENTS IN WASHINGTON:  (A) THE ASEAN AMBASSADORS\' TOUR; </p><p>AND (B) TO TESTIFY BEFORE CONGRESS IN CONNECTION WITH </p><p>JACKSON-VANIK.  THE ASEAN AMBASSADORS\' TOUR PROVIDES A </p><p>BROAD AUDIENCE OF IMPORTANT BUSINESS PEOPLE INTERESTED </p><p>IN KNOWING ABOUT VIETNAM\'S SITUATION.  IN THIS REGARD, </p><p>THEY WOULD ALSO FOLLOW CLOSELY DELIBERATIONS ON THE </p><p>HILL REGARDING JACKSON-VANIK.  AMB. PETERSON SOLICITED </p><p>FM NIEN\'S VIEWS AND ANY IDEAS THAT WOULD HELP BUILD THE </p><p>RELATIONSHIP FURTHER. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) NIEN COMMENTED THAT "WE SHOULD MEET EVERY TIME </p><p>YOU GO TO WASHINGTON AS WELL AS WHEN YOU RETURN."  HE </p><p>THANKED PRES. CLINTON AND THE ADMINISTRATION FOR AGAIN </p><p>RECOMMENDING A JACKSON-VANIK WAIVER FOR VIETNAM, BUT </p><p>HOPED THAT IN THE FUTURE THIS WOULD NO LONGER BE AN </p><p>ANNUAL NECESSITY. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) AMB. PETERSON SAID MANY IN THE U.S. WOULD ALSO </p><p>LIKE TO DO AWAY WITH THE NEED FOR ANNUAL WAIVERS, BUT </p><p>THAT THE POLITICAL CLIMATE THERE MADE THIS UNLIKELY. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  01316  01 OF 03  150821Z </p><p>HE EXPRESSED HIS VIEW THAT THE VOTES FOR WAIVER WILL </p><p>CONTINUE INTO THE FUTURE.  ON THE OTHER HAND, </p><p>CONGRESSIONAL ACTION ON THE BILATERAL TRADE AGREEMENT </p><p>(BTA) COULD GO QUICKLY ONCE A VOTE WAS ABLE TO BE </p><p>SCHEDULED SINCE IT WOULD BE DONE ON A FAST-TRACK, UP- </p><p>OR-DOWN VOTE BASIS.  THIS WOULD WORK TO VIETNAM\'S </p><p>BENEFIT. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) NIEN EXPRESSED THE GVN\'S GREAT "ANNOYANCE" AT </p><p>RECENT CONGRESSIONAL RESOLUTIONS DIRECTED AT VIETNAM. </p><p>AMB. PETERSON REPEATED THAT WHICH HE HAD RECENTLY TOLD </p><p>TO DEPUTY NATIONAL ASSEMBLY CHAIRMAN QUANG:  THERE IS A </p><p>CONSTITUTIONALLY DEFINED DIVISION OF POWERS IN OUR </p><p>GOVERNMENT.  SUCH ACTIONS AS THE NON-BINDING </p><p>RESOLUTIONS RESULT FROM CONSTITUENT GROUP PRESSURES ON </p><p>CONGRESS AND DO NOT TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE U.S\' </p><p>BROADER RELATIONS WITH COUNTRIES.  HE REITERATED THE </p><p>USG\'S COMMITMENT TO BUILDING THE BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP </p><p>AND ITS RECOGNITION OF VIETNAM\'S GOVERNMENT, DESPITE </p><p>WHAT MIGHT APPEAR IN NON-BINDING CONGRESSIONAL </p><p>RESOLUTIONS CALLING THAT FACT INTO QUESTION. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) NIEN SHIFTED TO GENERAL SECRETARY LE KHA </p><p>PHIEU\'S RECENT OFFICIAL TRIP TO FRANCE, ITALY AND THE </p><p>EU.  DESCRIBING IT AS "VERY POSITIVE," HE SAID THE </p><p>EUROPEANS "WERE MORE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT US THAN WE ARE." </p><p>HE HOPED THE USG WOULD FOLLOW THE SAME POSITIVE COURSE </p><p>REGARDING VIETNAM, THAT THIS WOULD BE REFLECTED IN THE </p><p>U.S.\' APPROACH TOWARD THE BTA. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) ON THE BTA, AMB. PETERSON SAID HE WANTED TO </p><p>STRESS THAT, IF MINISTER OF TRADE VU KHOAN GOES TO </p><p>WASHINGTON TO MEET WITH USTR BARSCHEFSKY IN RESPONSE TO </p><p>HER RECENT INVITATION, THAT HE GO WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO </p><p>FINALIZE THE AGREEMENT.  IF NOT, THE PSYCHOLOGICAL </p><p>DAMAGE TO THE BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP COULD BE QUITE </p><p>SEVERE.  THE GVN SHOULD THINK VERY CAREFULLY ABOUT </p><p>THIS, HE ADDED.  IT WOULD BE BETTER TO TELL US THAT THE </p><p>GVN HAD DECIDED TO PUT OFF ALL FURTHER CONSIDERATION OF </p><p>THE BTA UNTIL VIETNAM WAS READY RATHER THAN TO SEND </p><p>KHOAN WITH DEMANDS THE USG WOULD FIND UNACCEPTABLE. </p><p>THE AMBASSADOR NOTED THAT WE ARE DEALING WITH SO MANY </p><p>ISSUES THAT ARE REACHING A HEAD FOR DECISIONMAKING THAT </p><p>IT IS FRAYING OUR COLLECTIVE NERVES. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) THE RELATIONSHIP IS STILL FRAGILE, THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR ADDED.  BOTH SIDES NEED TO AVOID THE MINOR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  01316  02 OF 03  150821Z </p><p>IRRITANTS SO AS TO BE UNDISTRACTED IN PURSUING THE </p><p>BIGGER ISSUES.  FOR EXAMPLE, MFA PROTOCOL\'S RECENT </p><p>EFFORTS TO RESTRICT THE U.S. EMBASSY\'S NORMAL </p><p>ACTIVITIES IMPLIES A BREACH OF TRUST.  SUCH ACTIONS </p><p>"STRETCH THE FABRIC" OF OUR RELATIONSHIP.  CORDIALITY </p><p>IS CENTRAL IF THE MFA AND OUR DIPLOMATS ARE TO BE ABLE </p><p>TO WORK CONSTRUCTIVELY TOGETHER.  NIEN GAVE THE </p><p>PREDICTABLE MFA REPLY OF "WE DON\'T DISCRIMINATE IN </p><p>THIS.  IT\'S NORMAL."   AMB. PETERSON REPLIED THAT WE DO </p><p>NOT MAKE SUCH DEMANDS LIMITING DIPLOMATIC ACTIVITIES ON </p><p>SRV AMB. LE VAN BANG AND HIS DIPLOMATS IN THE U.S. </p><p>DEMANDS SUCH AS INSISTING THE EMBASSY NOTIFY THE MFA </p><p>EACH TIME IT HELD A PUBLIC EVENT OR SEEKING CLEARANCE </p><p>OF EVERY MAILING WE MADE TO VIETNAMESE SHOWS LACK OF </p><p>TRUST AND "CAUSES ME PERSONAL PAIN."  SUCH IRRITANTS </p><p>ARE EASILY AVOIDABLE AND SHOULD BE AVOIDED.  NIEN SAID </p><p>HE UNDERSTOOD AND WOULD "CHECK" INTO THIS ISSUE.  HE </p><p>AGREED BOTH SIDES NEEDED TO MAINTAIN TRUST.  (COMMENT: </p><p>NIEN HAS GIVEN THE SAME "WE\'LL CHECK INTO THIS" REPLY </p><p>WHENEVER THE AMBASSADOR HAS RAISED SIMILAR CONCERNS IN </p><p>THE PAST.  THE OFFICIAL HARASSMENT HAS CONTINUED OR </p><p>INCREASED SINCE.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) AMB. PETERSON SAID ONE AREA WHERE THE USG IS </p><p>DEMONSTRATING CONCRETELY ITS COMMITMENT TO MOVE FORWARD </p><p>WITH THE RELATIONSHIP IS IN AID.  USAID WILL SOON SET </p><p>UP AN OFFICE HERE AND WILL BEGIN TO PROVIDE DIRECT </p><p>ASSISTANCE.  UNDER COMMODITY EXCHANGE PROGRAMS, THE </p><p>U.S. HAS JUST TRANSFERRED AN ENTIRE HOSPITAL (WITHOUT </p><p>STAFF) TO CENTRAL VIETNAM AND WE ARE PROVIDING $3 </p><p>MILLION FOR ADDITIONAL HUMANITARIAN EFFORTS.  NIEN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  01316  02 OF 03  150821Z </p><p>WELCOMED SUCH AID, BUT ADDED VIETNAM ALSO NEEDED AID TO </p><p>DEAL WITH AGENT ORANGE. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR SAID THE USG COULD HELP VIETNAM </p><p>WITH HEALTH PROBLEMS, REGARDLESS OF THE CAUSE.  HE </p><p>STRESSED, HOWEVER, ON AGENT ORANGE, THE SCIENCE HAS YET </p><p>TO BE DONE.  HE SAID HE PLANNED TO DISCUSS WITH THE </p><p>NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES THE IDEA OF INVITING SRV </p><p>SCIENTISTS TO A MEETING IN THE U.S. TO DISCUSS WORKING </p><p>ON A FRAMEWORK FOR JOINT COOPERATION ON RESEARCHING </p><p>AGENT ORANGE.  HE HAS ALREADY ASKED MOSTE MINISTER NHA </p><p>TO MAKE SCIENTISTS AVAILABLE. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) NIEN HAD NO FURTHER COMMENTS ON AGENT ORANGE. </p><p>HE RETURNED TO THE BTA, URGING GREATER FLEXIBILITY FROM </p><p>THE USG.  THE AMBASSADOR REPLIED THAT HE HAD JUST </p><p>ATTENDED A UNDP PRESENTATION OUTLINING VIETNAM\'S </p><p>GREATEST NEEDS FOR DEVELOPMENT FOR THE NEXT DECADE. </p><p>THE NUMBER ONE RECOMMENDATION WAS THAT VIETNAM SIGN THE </p><p>BTA IMMEDIATELY AS IS.  THE BTA LAYS OUT ALL THE </p><p>PRECONDITIONS FOR CREATING THE MOST JOBS, GROWTH OF </p><p>WEALTH, A MORE OPEN INVESTMENT ENVIRONMENT, ETC.  THIS </p><p>STUDY IS AIMED AT THE CPV\'S UPCOMING NINTH PARTY </p><p>CONGRESS.  THE PLANNING NEEDS TO BE DONE NOW IF THE </p><p>ENORMOUS POTENTIAL OF THE VIETNAMESE PEOPLE IS TO BE </p><p>REALIZED, HE SAID. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C) COMMENT:  TYPICALLY FOR SRV OFFICIALS, NIEN </p><p>HAD NOTHING NEW OR TERRIBLY INSIGHTFUL TO SAY ON U.S.- </p><p>SRV RELATIONS, PARALLELING VICE FM BIN\'S CONVERSATIONS </p><p>WITH U/S PICKERING ON THE SAME SUBJECTS.  THE PRINCIPAL </p><p>VALUE IN THE MEETING WAS FOR THE AMBASSADOR TO CONVEY </p><p>TO THE SENIOR LEVEL USG THINKING ON A RANGE OF ISSUES. </p><p> NIEN AND HIS COLLEAGUES WILL LISTEN EQUALLY AS CLOSELY </p><p>WHEN THE AMBASSADOR RETURNS TO FILL THEM IN ON THE </p><p>LATEST THINKING ON VIETNAM IN WASHINGTON. </p><p>HARTER. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
