<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KUWAIT 000138 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT. FOR NEA/ARP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/12/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PINR, KU, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: GETTING THEIR HANDS DIRTY; INFLUENTIAL KUWAITI </p><p>BUSINESSMEN STEP UP TO THE POLITICAL PLATE </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Richard H. Jones for reason 1.5 (d) </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) This message contains biographical information. </p><p>Please see para. 8 for biographical information. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Summary.  Faced with ineffectual political leadership, </p><p>some of the large commercial families of Kuwait have stepped </p><p>into the political fray to derail the rising tide of Islamism </p><p>here, according to one of Kuwait\'s most successful </p><p>businessmen.  During discussions with Poloff and Commercial </p><p>Chief, billionaire Fouad al-Ghanim detailed his political </p><p>activism in Kuwait, and shared his thoughts on a post-Saddam </p><p>Iraq, U.S. leadership and the Israel/Palestine conflict.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) During a January 12 dinner hosted by Kuwaiti </p><p>businessman Fouad al-Ghanim for a visiting delegation from </p><p>the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), Poloff and Commercial </p><p>Chief discussed local politics with our host.  Calling </p><p>Islamist MP Nasser al-Sane, the parliamentary leader of the </p><p>Islamic Constitutional Movement, "the worst hypocrite," he </p><p>said the Islamists "are taking the country down a black </p><p>hole."  Al-Ghanim, himself a member of the CFR, who says he </p><p>does not mix business with politics, explained that he has </p><p>become more involved, as the ruling family has been incapable </p><p>and/or unwilling to speak out against the Islamists. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Blaming the ruling family for not doing enough to </p><p>combat "the downward spiral of Kuwait" (i.e. the waxing of </p><p>Islamist power, as representative of the kind of thought </p><p>which stifles political and economic reform), he said he told </p><p>other merchant families they would have to get involved if </p><p>they were to reverse the trend.  While criticizing the GOK, </p><p>al-Ghanim also praised Kuwait for its freedoms. "Do you know </p><p>of any other country in the region where one can sit in a </p><p>Diwaniya and criticize the government?" he asked.  "Name one </p><p>Saudi official who can speak openly!" </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Al-Ghanim said he has personally and actively </p><p>supported liberal (non-Islamist) candidates in many electoral </p><p>districts throughout Kuwait.  Responding to Poloff,s </p><p>question about how he influences voters to back his </p><p>candidates, al-Ghanim said he used his personal financial </p><p>resources to take care of their needs.  During Ramadan, for </p><p>example, every household in Al-Sane\'s district received a 100 </p><p>lb. bag of rice from al-Ghanim.  In addition, he has sent </p><p>voters on the umra pilgrimage at his own expense; three times </p><p>chartering jets for this purpose, and one time sending his </p><p>own.  Particularly in Bedouin districts, he said, "all (the </p><p>voters) want is someone to take care of them."  Al-Ghanim has </p><p>encouraged other successful businessmen to take care of </p><p>voters, as well.  Noting one example, he said that after </p><p>experiencing the largesse of one of his colleagues, 1200 </p><p>voters paid their respects by attending his Diwaniya (The </p><p>average attendance in large Kuwaiti Diwaniyas would rarely </p><p>surpass 100 people).  These types of efforts have cost </p><p>al-Ghanim alone over KD 500,000 (over USD $1,5 million).  The </p><p>Islamists do not have the personal resources to do this, he </p><p>noted. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>A stable Iraq necessitates a stable region </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Al-Ghanim is very familiar with Iraq, having been </p><p>raised and schooled there.  While he is interested in </p><p>renewing his commercial ties in Iraq in the future, al-Ghanim </p><p>repeated a warning he said he had recently shared with </p><p>Secretary Powell and National Security Advisor Rice.  "You </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>have to look at this on a regional level," he said.  "You </p><p>cannot have stability in Iraq until you solve the situation </p><p>in Palestine."  He added that solving this problem would help </p><p>the U.S. in the region, by taking away the excuse Islamists </p><p>and other Arabs and Muslims use to support their </p><p>anti-Americanism. (Comment: During the Iran-Iraq war, he was </p><p>involved in the construction of major infrastructure </p><p>projects, such as power plants and bridges. End Comment) </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>Sow Peace, not Pride </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) In addition to its actions in the Middle East, </p><p>al-Ghanim said the U.S. needs to watch itself at home.  He </p><p>said Americans have allowed the authorities to go "too far" </p><p>in the U.S., creating the perception among many U.S. Muslims </p><p>and their brethren abroad that the U.S. war on terror is a </p><p>war on Islam.  Criticizing the Administration, al-Ghanim said </p><p>there are too many high-level advisers who are "conceited" </p><p>about American power, and this is reflected in both domestic </p><p>and foreign policies.  "You need to sow peace in the world, </p><p>not pride," he said. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>Biographical Information </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>8. (U) Fouad M. T. Al-Ghanim, born 20 December, 1944, is a </p><p>1966 graduate of Iowa State University, where he earned a </p><p>B.SC in Sciences and Humanities.
