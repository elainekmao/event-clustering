(SBU) SUMMARY: EMBASSY URGES WASHINGTON AGENCIES TO </p><p>SUPPORT THE WORLD BANK\'S POVERTY REDUCTION SUPPORT CREDIT </p><p>(PRSC) PROPOSAL TO BE PRESENTED TO THE BANK\'S BOARD IN EARLY </p><p>MAY.  WE RECOGNIZE THAT THE PRSC, LIKE THE IMF\'S POVERTY </p><p>REDUCTION AND GROWTH FACILITY (PRGF) CONSIDERED BY THE IMF </p><p>BOARD ON APRIL 6, IS NOT PERFECT.  IN FACT, WE AGREE WITH A </p><p>NUMBER OF THE OBSERVATIONS MADE BY THE U.S. EXECUTIVE </p><p>DIRECTOR\'S OFFICE WHEN IT ABSTAINED ON THE PRGF.  (WE </p><p>COMMENT ON SOME OF THESE OBSERVATIONS BELOW.)  BUT WE THINK </p><p>THE IMF/WB STRUCTURAL PROGRAM OPERATING IN TANDEM WITH THE </p><p>TRADE OBLIGATIONS THE VIETNAMESE GOVERNMENT HAS ASSUMED </p><p>UNDER THE ASEAN FREE TRADE AREA AGREEMENT AND WILL ASSUME </p><p>WHEN THE U.S.-VIETNAM BILATERAL TRADE AGREEMENT ENTERS INTO </p><p>FORCE PROVIDE THE BEST PROSPECT FOR PROMOTING MARKET- </p><p>ORIENTATION AND INTERNATIONAL COMPETITIVENESS THAT THE </p><p>VIETNAMESE ECONOMY HAS SEEN IN DECADES, IF EVER.  WHILE </p><p>UNTESTED, WE ARE ALSO HOPEFUL RECENT LEADERSHIP AND </p><p>STRUCTURAL CHANGES IN VIETNAM\'S POLITBURO WILL REINVIGORATE </p><p>ECONOMIC REFORM MOMENTUM.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) WHILE ABSTAINING ON THE PRGF DUE TO GRAMM </p><p>AMENDMENT CONSIDERATIONS (APPLICABLE ONLY TO IMF LENDING), </p><p>THE U.S. EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR TO THE IMF RAISED A NUMBER OF </p><p>VALID CONCERNS ABOUT THE PROPOSED FACILITY.  SINCE BOTH </p><p>STRUCTURAL PROGRAMS (PRGF AND PRSC) WERE DESIGNED TO WORK </p><p>TOGETHER, WE ANTICIPATE WASHINGTON AGENCIES MAY RAISE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  01017  01 OF 04  271124Z </p><p>SIMILAR ISSUES WHEN TAKING UP THE WORLD BANK\'S CREDIT </p><p>PROGRAM.  WHEN THE IMF\'S BOARD TOOK UP THE IMF\'S FACILITY, </p><p>THE U.S. EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR QUESTIONED THE VIETNAMESE </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S ABILITY TO KEEP PUBLIC SECTOR DEBT UNDER </p><p>CONTROL AND WHETHER FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY WOULD BE </p><p>ADEQUATELY SAFEGUARDED THROUGH THE LIFE OF THE PROGRAM.  THE </p><p>U.S. EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR ALSO QUESTIONED THE FIGURES FOR THE </p><p>STOCK OF NON-PERFORMING LOANS.  IN ADDITION, SERIOUS </p><p>RESERVATIONS WERE EXPRESSED ABOUT THE IMF\'S APPROACH TO </p><p>STATE-OWNED COMMERCIAL BANK REFORM; THE U.S. EXECUTIVE </p><p>DIRECTOR WONDERED WHY THE PROGRAM DIDN\'T FOCUS ON </p><p>DISMANTLING STATE-OWNED COMMERCIAL BANKS, SO THAT THEY COULD </p><p>BE REPLACED WITH PRIVATE COMMERCIAL BANKS, RATHER THAN </p><p>REHABILITATION THROUGH IMF-FUNDED RESTRUCTURING.  FINALLY, </p><p>QUESTIONS WERE RAISED REGARDING MONITORING OF STATE-OWNED </p><p>ENTERPRISES UNDER THE PROGRAM: IF STATE-OWNED COMMERCIAL </p><p>LENDING TO STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISES WERE CUT OFF, HOW WOULD </p><p>PROGRAM MANAGERS ASSURE STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISES WEREN\'T </p><p>FINANCED `BACKDOOR\' THROUGH THE GOVERNMENT\'S BUDGET, A </p><p>PARTICULARLY TROUBLING PROBLEM IN VIETNAM WHERE THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S BUDGET PRESENTATION REMAINS OPAQUE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) THESE ARE ALL EXCELLENT QUESTIONS AND, FRANKLY, IT </p><p>IS DIFFICULT TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE REPLIES.  WE COMMENT BELOW </p><p>ON SOME OF THESE CONCERNS. </p><p> </p><p>PUBLIC SECTOR DEBT - WE WERE SURPRISED WASHINGTON AGENCIES </p><p>FOCUSED ON THE STOCK OF VIETNAM\'S PUBLIC DEBT AT THE IMF </p><p>BOARD MEETING WHICH CONSIDERED THE PRGF.  THAT DEBT STANDS </p><p>AT 63% OF GDP, A LARGE NUMBER BUT LESS THAN HALF OF WHERE </p><p>MANY DEVELOPING COUNTRIES AND AT LEAST ONE DEVELOPED COUNTRY </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  01017  01 OF 04  271124Z </p><p>(JAPAN) ARE TODAY.  WE ALSO CONSIDER THE PROSPECTS FOR </p><p>VIETNAM\'S CONTINUED REAL GROWTH REMAIN FAVORABLE.  A MAJOR </p><p>REASON FOR THE GVN TO UNDERTAKE THE PRSC AND THE PRGF </p><p>PROGRAMS IS TO ADDRESS THE STOCK OF STA </p><p></p></div>
