NIWA MAY 28 LETTER TO AMBASSADOR JETER </p><p>     B. HOPPER/OVERFIELD JUNE 19 EMAIL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. The U.S. Mission to Nigeria cannot support at this time </p><p>the proposed project presented by the National Inland </p><p>Waterways Authority (NIWA) (Ref A).  This decision is based </p><p>on several considerations.   First, it is impossible to tell </p><p>from NIWA\'s proposal exactly what they wish the Army Corps of </p><p>Engineers to do. There is presently no funding and virtually </p><p>no prospects for significant funding for any major </p><p>undertaking.  ODC, USAID, and other Western donor agencies do </p><p>not have funding to pay for a major project nor has the </p><p>National Inland Waterway Authority demonstrated that they </p><p>have the funds necessary for even a preliminary study.  Given </p><p>the current fiscal constraints in Nigeria, where many </p><p>thousands of civil servants wait months for their salaries, </p><p>it is highly unlikely that GON funds, even if promised, would </p><p>be made available in the near term. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  The Mission would be pleased to revisit this decision if </p><p>the NIWA proposal were better defined and resources </p><p>identified.  Even at that point, the Mission would be hard </p><p>pressed to support major undertakings, especially outside the </p><p>metropolitan areas of Abuja and Lagos.  Mission </p><p>administrative offices are understaffed and in cramped </p><p>temporary quarters in which they will remain for the </p><p>foreseeable future, probably until the new Chancery is </p><p>completed in 2004. The security situation outside the major </p><p>cities is sometimes volatile with sudden, unanticipated, </p><p>communal violence a possibility in some areas of the country. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. An additional concern is the need for assurances that </p><p>environmental and economic impact studies, as required by </p><p>authorities in both Nigeria and the United States, are </p><p>undertaken before a major project, such as dredging of the </p><p>Niger River, begins.  Moreover, there are political forces in </p><p>Nigeria, including local communities that would be </p><p>significantly impacted by the proposed activity.  Nascent </p><p>environmental groups would also become involved eventually, </p><p>especially in the aggrieved and volatile Niger Delta. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
