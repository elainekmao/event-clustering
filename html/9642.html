<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 ANKARA 004692 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, EB/CBA, EB/IFD, AND EUR/SE </p><p>USDOC FOR 4212/ITA/MAC/OEURA/DDEFALCO </p><p>USDA FOR FAS FOR EC AND CCC/FSA </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA - MILLS AND LEICHTER </p><p>NSC FOR BRYZA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EINV, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: LITTLE PROGRESS ON RESOLVING BOT AND CARGILL/ADM </p><p>INVESTMENT ISSUES </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 3343 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary:  Turkish authorities are making little if </p><p>any progress toward resolving the investment disputes </p><p>involving U.S. power generation and starch-based sweetener </p><p>companies.  The BOT issue is being held up in part due to </p><p>disagreements between the Energy Ministry and the Energy </p><p>Market Regulatory Authority (EMRA); each is waiting for the </p><p>other to act, and neither is communicating with the </p><p>companies.  The EMRA President assured us this week that, if </p><p>the problem remains unresolved when the end-August licensing </p><p>deadline hits, he will unilaterally extend the deadline to </p><p>allow the companies to continue to operate.  On the sweetener </p><p>issue, Cargill has made some progress in its legal battles </p><p>over zoning, but understands that Industry Minister Coskun </p><p>has tentatively decided not to increase the quota for </p><p>starch-based sweetener production from 10 to 15 percent, as </p><p>was done last year.  If Coskun sticks to this decision, both </p><p>Cargill and ADM will face major difficulties.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) During the past week, EconCouns met with Energy U/S </p><p>Sami Demirbilek and Energy Market Regulatory Authority (EMRA) </p><p>President Yusuf Gunay to express concern about the lack of </p><p>progress in resolving the issues surrounding U.S.-owned and </p><p>USG-supported BOT power generation projects.  As reported in </p><p>reftel, the fundamental problem is that the Energy Ministry </p><p>has been pressing the power generation companies (in a </p><p>heavy-handed manner) to reduce their prices, or risk not </p><p>having their new license applications approved by EMRA. </p><p>(Note:  Under EMRA regulations, all power generation </p><p>companies, including those already operating, are required to </p><p>apply and obtain new operating licenses.  EMRA officials </p><p>insisted this was a pro forma process for existing companies, </p><p>but Ministry officials indicated it might not be.  Moreover, </p><p>the langauge in the license applications suggested the </p><p>companies might be giving up their existing contractual </p><p>rights by applying.  End note). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  EconCouns reminded both Demirbilek and Gunay that, </p><p>during a May 2003 visit to Ankara (reftel), a group of </p><p>international export credit agencies had expressed concern </p><p>about these developments and had urged the GOT to clarify in </p><p>writing that the companies, by applying for new licenses, </p><p>would not give up any of their existing contractual </p><p>obligations.  They also had suggested that any GOT move to </p><p>violate or force changes in existing contracts would have </p><p>negative consequences for Turkey\'s broader efforts to attract </p><p>investment into the sector.  (In response, GOT officials had </p><p>promised to clarify that the companies would not give up </p><p>their existing contractual rights by applying for new </p><p>licenses, and had insisted that they had no intention of </p><p>violating contracts.  Rather, they were only asking the </p><p>companies to work with them to facilitate Turkey\'s transition </p><p>to a market-based energy sector.)  Following the meeting, </p><p>OPIC had sent a letter to the EMRA President highlighting the </p><p>areas of discussion and the GOT commitments. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  EconCouns noted that, two months later, the GOT </p><p>has neither issued the promised clarification nor responded </p><p>to the OPIC letter.  With the deadline for issuance of new </p><p>licenses fast approaching (end-August), we are increasingly </p><p>concerned about the lack of progress.  EconCouns asked how </p><p>GOT authorities plan to resolve this problem. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Demirbilek said there were many possible solutions </p><p>to the problem, but under any circumstances the GOT would not </p><p>violate or unilaterally abrogate the contracts.  The first </p><p>step, however, is for EMRA to forward its proposals on how </p><p>the contracts could be revised to facilitate Turkey\'s shift </p><p>to a market-based electricity system.  The Ministry would </p><p>review those proposals, and then try to find a solution. </p><p>Despite repeated queries, Demirbilek did not comment on why </p><p>the GOT had failed to provide the promised clarification of </p><p>the companies\' rights under the existing contracts.  In a </p><p>troubling aside, he noted that the Ministry had determiend </p><p>that one of the companies -- Doga (partly owned by U.S.-based </p><p>Edison Mission) --  was violating the terms of its contract, </p><p>and was continuing to look into the other companies\' </p><p>performances.  (Note:  A standard GOT approach on domestic </p><p>and international energy issues has been to use a minor, </p><p>technical violation of contracts to force concessions from </p><p>its "partners.") </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) Gunay countered that EMRA was in no position to </p><p>present proposals to the Ministry, and in any case the </p><p>Ministry had no right to judge the utility of any proposals. </p><p>Instead, Gunay has asked the companies to offer ideas on how </p><p>they could facilitate the sector\'s transition.  These might </p><p>include, for example, giving up government purchase </p><p>guarantees in return for a longer operating period before </p><p>they turn the projects over to the government. </p><p>Unfortunately, Gunay said, the Ministry\'s approach on prices </p><p>has "turned off" the companies, making them defensive and </p><p>unenthusiastic about offering any concessions.  Gunay said </p><p>price should not be the issue.  Sure, the contract prices are </p><p>high, but the GOT signed these contracts and thus has no </p><p>grounds for complaint. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU)  As for next steps, Gunay said he had written to </p><p>the Ministry advising that EMRA had reached the licensing </p><p>stage.  He is not seeking the Ministry\'s approval, but wants </p><p>to be able to show that the Ministry was aware that EMRA </p><p>would be issuing licenses so that they could not later blame </p><p>EMRA for issuing licenses and thus undermining the Ministry\'s </p><p>efforts to obtain price concessions.  If the Ministry </p><p>responds to his letter by saying it is about to reach </p><p>agreement with the companies on a new price, he will extend </p><p>the licensing deadline to allow the agreement to be </p><p>concluded.  If the Ministry says there is no such agreement, </p><p>he will issue the licenses.   He urged us not to worry, </p><p>saying that, in the worst case, he would extend the licensing </p><p>deadline so the companies could continue to operate.  Gunay </p><p>added that he would respond to OPIC\'s letter as soon as he </p><p>heard back from the Ministry. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU)  In a separate meeting, Cargill executives updated </p><p>us on the problems facing both the company and the broader </p><p>starch-based sweetener industry, including U.S.-based ADM. </p><p>There has been some progress on the Cargill-specific issue, </p><p>which involves legal actions against its factory for being </p><p>improperly zoned.  The Danistay (State Council) had recently </p><p>rejected two law suits aimed at annulling its construction </p><p>license, based on the Danistay\'s view that the plaintiffs had </p><p>no legal basis for suing.  However, the Danistay had ruled </p><p>against Cargill in a third case -- brought by the same </p><p>plaintiffs -- involving the plant\'s emissions permit, based </p><p>on the argument that, since the plant was improperly zoned, </p><p>its emissions permit was improperly issued.  Cargill is </p><p>appealing this decision, and generally sees the Danistay\'s </p><p>actions as positive.  Meanwhile, senior Industry Ministry </p><p>officials, including Minister Ali Coskun, continue to tell </p><p>Cargill that they expect to submit to Parliament a new </p><p>industrial zoning law, which would effectively enable Cargill </p><p>to "re-zone" its factory, in September.  (Note:  Cargill </p><p>executives are a bit skeptical, as Coskun has been promising </p><p>action on this for some time.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU)  The other issue, which affects ADM as well as </p><p>Cargill, is how the government will implement the sugar </p><p>production quota.  Under the Sugar Law, the Sugar Board sets </p><p>an annual production quota for the entire sweetener industry </p><p>(sugar, fructose, glucose), and fructose/glucose producers </p><p>such as Cargill and ADM are limited to 10 percent of the </p><p>quota.  Last year, the government set the total quota </p><p>significantly above domestic demand (2,340,000 tons compared </p><p>to domestic demand of about 1,850,000 tons), and raised the </p><p>fructose/glucose sub-quota to 15 percent (as allowed by the </p><p>law).  These two moves enabled starch-based sweetener </p><p>producers to continue operating at reasonable levels, even if </p><p>below capacity. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) This year, however, Cargill has heard that Minister </p><p>Coskun is siding with the sugar beet producers and is </p><p>planning to keep the sub-quota at 10 percent (though the </p><p>overall sweetener production quota will remain at 2,340,000 </p><p>tons).  If he sticks to this decision, the starch-based </p><p>sweetener producers will be forced to produce at far below </p><p>capacity, raising serioius questions about their ability to </p><p>continue.  Cargill and ADM have organized a group made up of </p><p>their major customers -- the cola, fruit juice, and </p><p>confectionary companies -- to meet with Prime Minister </p><p>Erdogan in the coming weeks to lobby for a 15 percent quota. </p><p>If this approach fails, Cargill and ADM might ask the Embassy </p><p>to weigh in (until now, they have kept us informed but asked </p><p>us not to weigh in). </p><p>DEUTSCH </p><p></p></div>
