<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L BAGHDAD 05528 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS: PREL, USUN, IZ, IR </p><p>SUBJECT: RAFSANJANI STICKS TO NAMING AGGRESSOR BEFORE </p><p>-        CEASEFIRE </p><p> </p><p>REF: BAGHDAD 5515 </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) DURING RECENT MEETING, MFA INTERNATIONAL </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS DIRECTOR AL-QAYSI PROVIDED DCM WITH MFA </p><p>ARABIC TRANSLATION OF OCTOBER 25 TEHRAN RADIO INTERVIEW </p><p>WITH RAFSANJANI IN WHICH RAFSANJANI SAID THAT NAMING THE </p><p>AGGRESSOR MUST PRECEDE A CEASEFIRE AND THAO ONLY NAMING </p><p>THE AGGRESSOR OR DEFEATING THE AGGRESSOR WILL END THE </p><p>WAR.  AL-QAYSI ASKED RHETORICALLY WHY IRAQ SHOULD BE </p><p>ASKED TO ABANDON THE SEQUENTIAL ORDER OF 598 WHEN IRAN, </p><p>AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS, CONTINUES TO INSIST THAT "THE </p><p>AGGRESSOR BE NAMED" BEFORE THERE IS EVEN A CEASEFIRE, </p><p>MUCH LESS WITHDRAWAL.  THAT SAID, HE AND HIS COLLEAGUES </p><p>HAVE AVOIDED GIVING ANY HINT OF IRAQ\'S POSITION ON </p><p>SIMULTANEOUS VS SEQUENTIAL IMPLEMENTATION PENDING </p><p>DELIVERY OF IRAQ\'S RESPONSE TO THE SYG OCTOBER 30 </p><p>(REFTEL). </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) FOR THE RECORD, INFORMAL EMBASSY TRANSLATION OF </p><p>MFA TRANSLATION OF THE INTERVIEW FOLLOWS.  BEGIN TEXT: </p><p> </p><p>INTERVIEW WITH RAFSANJANI </p><p>TEHRAN RADIO </p><p>2330, OCTOBER 25, 1987 </p><p> </p><p>Q. MY QUESTION IS CONNECTED WITH THE GULF WAR.  THE </p><p>UNSG HAS SUGGESTED A PLAN OF NINE POINTS TO EFFECT A </p><p>TEMPORARY CEASEFIRE AND ESTABLISH A COURT TO JUDGE </p><p>THE AGGRESSOR.  REPORTS INDICATE THAT THE UNSG HAS </p><p>PASSED THEIR SUGGESTION TO OFFICIALS OF BOTY COUNTRIES </p><p>(IRAN AND IRAQ).  WHAT IS YOUR VIEW OF THIS AND WHAT </p><p>IS THE POSITION OF THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN? </p><p> </p><p>A. WE HAVE RECEIVED SUCH A THING.  ITS CONTENT IS </p><p>SIMILAR TO WHAT HAS ALREADY BEEN REPORTED.  IT HAS </p><p>BEEN AGREED TO ESTABLISH A COMMITTEE TO DETERMINE THE </p><p>AGGRESSOR AND THAT IT SHOULD START ITS WORK.  IT WAS </p><p>ALSO SUGGESTED THAT A CEASEFIRE SHOULD TAKE PLACE, BUT </p><p>THE TIMING OF THESE TWO THINGS HAS NOT BEEN FIXED.  WE </p><p>BELIEVE THAT A CEASEFIRE WILL TAKE PLACE AFTER THE </p><p>AGGRESSOR IS NAMED AND, IN THIS CONNECTION, THERE ARE </p><p>DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN THE FOREIGN MINISTRY, THE UNSG, </p><p>AND OTHERS.  WE DO NOT WANT TO USE DELAYING TACTICS </p><p>AND PROLONG THE DISCUSSIONS AS SOME PARTIES EXPECT </p><p>AND BELIEVE. </p><p> </p><p>FROM THE BEGINNING, WE HAVE SAID OUR LAST WORD.  WE </p><p>BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE ONLY TWO WAYS TO END THE WAR: </p><p> </p><p>(1) TO NAME THE AGGRESSOR; (2) TO DEFEAT THE AGGRESSOR, </p><p>WHICH WILL END THE WAR AUTOMATICALLY. </p><p> </p><p>THE FIRST WILL END THE WAR BY POLITICAL METHODS; THE </p><p>SECOND WILL END IT BY MILITARY MEANS.  IF THE UNSC </p><p>DOES ITS DUTY AND ACCEPTS ITS RESPONSIBILITIES, THE </p><p>FIRST (POLITICAL METHOD) WILL PREVAIL AND COULD BE </p><p>IMPLEMENTED.  END TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>NEWTON </p><p></p></div>
