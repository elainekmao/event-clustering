<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ISLAMABAD 000648 </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR SA/PAB, S/CT, DS/ITA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  2/06/11 </p><p>TAGS:  PTER, EAIR, PLO, PK </p><p>SUBJECT:  UPDATE:  PAN AM HIJACKERS </p><p> </p><p>REFS:  2000 ISLAMABAD 6055 (B)  2000 ISLAMABAD 1120 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U)  CLASSIFIED BY MICHELE J. SISON, DEPUTY CHIEF </p><p>OF MISSION, FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  SUMMARY.  ALL FIVE PAN AM 73 HIJACKERS </p><p>REMAIN INCARCERATED AT ADIALA PRISON, RAWALPINDI. </p><p>A JANUARY 31 LAHORE HIGH COURT (RAWALPINDI BENCH) </p><p>DEPORTATION HEARING CONSIDERED THE CASE OF </p><p>HIJACKER SULIEMAN AL-TURKI ONLY.  ACTION ON AL- </p><p>TURKI\'S DEPORTATION REMAINS PENDING AS THE LIBYAN </p><p>EMBASSY HAS NOT CONFIRMED THAT AL-TURKI IS A </p><p>LIBYAN CITIZEN.  IT IS UNLIKELY THAT THERE WILL </p><p>BE FURTHER MOVEMENT ON THIS CASE UNTIL AL-TURKI\'S </p><p>ATTORNEY FILES ANOTHER PETITION WITH THE COURT. </p><p>THE DEPORTATIONS IN QUESTION WOULD BE BACK TO THE </p><p>DEFENDANTS\' CLAIMED COUNTRY OF ORIGIN -- NOT, AT </p><p>THIS POINT, TO THE UNITED STATES TO STAND TRIAL. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  (SUMMARY, CONTINUED)  MEANWHILE, AN </p><p>INVESTIGATIVE TEAM FROM FBI\'S WASHINGTON FIELD </p><p>OFFICE ARRIVED ON JANUARY 30 TO CONTINUING THE </p><p>INTERVIEWING OF WITNESSES AND FEDERAL </p><p>INVESTIGATIVE AGENCY PERSONNEL WHO PARTICIPATED </p><p>IN THE ORIGINAL PAN AM 73 INVESTIGATION.  THE </p><p>TEAM WILL ALSO FOLLOW UP ON PREVIOUS FBI REQUESTS </p><p>FOR ORIGINAL DOCUMENTATION AND PHYSICAL EVIDENCE. </p><p> </p><p>3.   (C)  ON SEPTEMBER 5, 1986, SIX ABU NIDAL </p><p>ORGANIZATION (ANO) TERRORISTS HIJACKED PAN AM 73 </p><p>IN KARACHI.  TWENTY-TWO PASSENGERS WERE KILLED </p><p>AND 125 WOUNDED IN THE INCIDENT.  THE HIJACKERS </p><p>RECEIVED THE DEATH PENALTY, WHICH WAS THEN </p><p>REDUCED TO LIFE, AND THEN TO FOURTEEN YEARS (NOW </p><p>COMPLETED).  ONE OF THE HIJACKERS DIED WHILE IN </p><p>CUSTODY; THE OTHER FIVE -- SOULIEMAN AL TURKI, </p><p>MUSTAFA HASSAN SAEED BOMER, MANSOOR AL-RASHID, </p><p>MUHAMMAD ABDUL KHALIL HUSAIN AL-RAHAYAL AND JAMAL </p><p>SAEED ABDUL RAHIM AL-FAHID -- REMAIN INCARCERATED </p><p>IN ADIALA PRISON IN RAWALPINDI. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  THE NATIONALITY OF SEVERAL OF THE </p><p>HIJACKERS REMAINS IN QUESTION.  BOMER HAS BEEN </p><p>IDENTIFIED AS A JORDANIAN NATIONAL, AND WE </p><p>UNDERSTAND THAT DEPORTATION DISCUSSIONS ARE </p><p>UNDERWAY WITH THE GOJ.  THE GOVERNMENT OF LIBYA </p><p>HAS NOT YET ACCEPTED AL TURKI\'S CLAIM THAT HE IS </p><p>A LIBYAN.  AL TURKI\'S JANUARY 31 LAHORE HIGH </p><p>COURT (RAWALPINDI BENCH) DEPORTATION HEARING WAS </p><p>THUS STYMIED; WE EXPECT AL TURKI\'S LAWYER TO FILE </p><p>ANOTHER PETITION FOR RELEASE/DEPORTATION (TIMING </p><p>UNKNOWN).  THE REMAINING THREE HIJACKERS CLAIM TO </p><p>BE PALESTINIAN, A CLAIM THAT THE PALESTINIAN </p><p>EMBASSY HAS THUS FAR REPORTEDLY REJECTED. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  THE GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN IS AWARE OF </p><p>THE USG\'S INTEREST IN THE FUTURE PROSECUTION OF </p><p>THE FIVE HIJACKERS.  WE HAVE RAISED THE ISSUE </p><p>WITH INTERIOR MINISTER HAIDER A NUMBER OF TIMES, </p><p>AND HE HAS DIRECTED HIS MINISTRY TO ASSIST US </p><p>WITH OUR REQUEST FOR DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE AND </p><p>WITNESS ACCESS RELATED TO DEVELOPING THE CASE. IN </p><p>ADDITION, AT THE EMBASSY\'S REQUEST, INTERIOR </p><p>MINISTRY DEPUTY SECRETARY (POLITICAL) HUSSAIN </p><p>CHAUDRY BRIEFED US ON FEBRUARY 1 ON THE AL-TURKI </p><p>DEPORTATION HEARING (ONE OF CHAUDRY\'S OFFICER HAD </p><p>BEEN ASSIGNED TO ATTEND THE HEARING). </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  THE JANUARY 31 HEARING HAD BEEN SPURRED </p><p>BY A PETITION FILED BY AL TURKI\'S ATTORNEY </p><p>SEEKING IMMEDIATE RELEASE FROM CUSTODY (THE </p><p>DEFENDANT HAS NOW SERVED TIME IN EXCESS OF 14 </p><p>YEARS).  THE GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN\'S </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE INFORMED THE COURT THAT THE </p><p>MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS WAS WORKING WITH THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT OF LIBYA TO ARRANGE FOR SOULIEMAN\'S </p><p>DEPORTATION.  THE GOP REPRESENTATIVE ALSO </p><p>INFORMED THE JUDGE THAT CONSULAR ACCESS HAD BEEN </p><p>GRANTED TO THE LIBYAN EMBASSY TO MEET WITH THE </p><p>DEFENDANT, ALTHOUGH THE GOVERNMENT OF LIBYA HAD </p><p>NOT YET CONFIRMED AL TURKI\'S CITIZENSHIP. </p><p>ACCORDING TO MINISTRY OF INTERIOR OFFICIALS, THE </p><p>JUDGE APPARENTLY DID NOT SPECIFY A TIMEFRAME IN </p><p>HIS RULING, BUT INSTRUCTED THE GOVERNMENT OF </p><p>PAKISTAN REPRESENTATIVE TO WORK TO EXPEDITE AL </p><p>TURKI\'S DEPORTATION. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) THE FBI HAS BEEN ALLOWED TO PROCESS THE </p><p>HIJACKERS FOR PHOTOGRAPHS AND FINGERPRINTS.  THE </p><p>GOP HAS COOPERATED IN LOCATING AND ARRANGING </p><p>INTERVIEWS OF A NUMBER OF THE GOP WITNESSES.  THE </p><p>GOP HAS PROVIDED THE FBI WITH A CERTIFIED COPY OF </p><p>THE CASE PROPERTY, THE FIRST INFORMATION REPORT </p><p>(FIR) PREPARED ON THE CASE, AND AN UNSIGNED COPY </p><p>OF A JOINT STATEMENT BY THE HIJACKERS. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C)  THE VISITING FBI WASHINGTON FIELD OFFICE </p><p>TEAM CONTINUES IN ITS EFFORTS TO SECURE (A) </p><p>COMPLETE COPIES OF INTERROGATION REPORTS PREPARED </p><p>BY THE PAKISTANI INTER-SERVICES INTELLIGENCE </p><p>DIRECTORATE (ISID) FOR EACH OF THE FIVE </p><p>HIJACKERS; (B)  A CERTIFIED COPY OF THE TRIAL </p><p>TRANSCRIPT; (C)  A CERTIFIED COPY OF THE COURT </p><p>RECORD; (D) INDIVIDUAL STATEMENTS OF THE FIVE </p><p>HIJACKERS; (E)  A DUPLICATE VIDEOTAPE TAKEN OF </p><p>THE CRIME SCENE; (F)  LEGAL COMMENTS MEMORANDUM </p><p>DATED 9/6-9/87; AND (G) MEMORANDUM OF LEGAL </p><p>ADVISOR JAMSHED HAMID. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) THE VISITING SPECIAL AGENTS HAVE ARRANGED </p><p>A MEETING WITH ADIALA PRISON AUTHORITIES THIS </p><p>WEEK TO PURSUE THEIR INVESTIGATION. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MILAM </p><p></p></div>
