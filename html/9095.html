<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 SANAA 001577 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR A/S CRANER FROM AMBASSADOR HULL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/01/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PREL, PINR, YM, HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR AND MINISTER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS:  LET\'S </p><p>WORK TOGETHER </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edmund J. Hull for Reasons 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary:  The Ambassador called on the newly-appointed </p><p>Minister of Human Rights Amat al-Alim al-Suswa on June 30. </p><p>In a cordial meeting, they discussed the state of human </p><p>rights in Yemen, the 2002 Human Rights Report, developments </p><p>in the new Ministry and specific human rights issues, </p><p>including women, prisons, security forces and the media. </p><p>They also explored areas of closer cooperation, including </p><p>increasing potential USG assistance such as community </p><p>policing and media training.  The Ambassador offered to see </p><p>if A/S Craner might be available to meet with al-Suswa during </p><p>her planned visit to Washington for Yemen Days September 5-6 </p><p>(see paragraph 12).  Acting Pol/Econ Chief and A/PAO also </p><p>attended.  See biographic note in paragraph 11.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>General Environment for Human Rights; </p><p>New Ministry of Human Rights </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  The Ambassador and Minister agreed that human rights </p><p>remains a difficult issue in Yemen that must be addressed on </p><p>all fronts.  At the same time, they agreed that, unlike in </p><p>some other Middle Eastern countries, the environment of </p><p>openness and a higher level of freedom in Yemen offers </p><p>opportunities to make great progress in improving human </p><p>rights.  The Minister said there is great willingness to </p><p>admit to problems, but often the capacity to address them was </p><p>hindered by economic, social and sometimes bureaucratic </p><p>constraints. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  In the government formed in May 2003, the previous </p><p>structure of a Minister of State for Human Rights </p><p>coordinating the work of an inter-agency committee was </p><p>improved to the status of a full Ministry of Human Rights. </p><p>The Minister said she has a lot of work to do and asked for </p><p>patience while she works to improve the capacity of the new </p><p>ministry to undertake work, particularly in the areas of </p><p>staff development and addressing specific complaints. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>Human Rights Report (HRR) </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  The Ambassador encouraged the Minister to increase </p><p>the dialogue between the Embassy and the Ministry on human </p><p>rights in general and the HRR specifically.  He urged the </p><p>Minister to work with other ministries to bring old cases to </p><p>resolution.  The Minister agreed, citing the issue of the </p><p>disappeared from the 1986 and 1994 conflicts.  She said the </p><p>families of the disappeared had come to informal agreement </p><p>with the ROYG to resolve the issue, but that it should be </p><p>resolved in an official manner. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  The Minister indicated that the ROYG felt that the </p><p>HRR was "important input" in improving their human rights </p><p>situation.  The ROYG plans to issue an official government </p><p>response to the 2002 HRR as it did in 2001, which would be </p><p>published and discussed widely.  She said the inter-agency </p><p>process was ongoing to formulate the response.  The </p><p>Ambassador said the 2001 response was appreciated for its </p><p>evidence of Yemen taking the HRR seriously and that it was </p><p>taken into account as the 2002 HRR was drafted.  He added </p><p>that dialogue on the report should be continual and frequent </p><p>as well. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  The Minister said that the ROYG was planning to </p><p>develop a report on the U.S. treatment of Yemenis and </p><p>Yemeni-Americans, citing ill-treatment in the aftermath of </p><p>9/11 including Guantanamo detainees and arrests in the U.S. </p><p>The Ambassador said the U.S. has a sincere desire to protect </p><p>people\'s rights and that we should continue to discuss the </p><p>issue. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>Issues:  Women, Prisons, Security Services, Media </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  The Ambassador brought up the status of women as one </p><p>of the key concerns about human rights in Yemen.  The </p><p>Minister agreed, noting it as one of her main interests.  She </p><p>said it is a "huge, complex and difficult" issue because of </p><p>Yemeni traditional society.  She noted that the ROYG cabinet </p><p>plans to endorse a Strategy for Women.  She used the horrible </p><p>treatment of women in prisons as an example of the extreme </p><p>situation.  She said that while progress has been made on </p><p>their conditions with the change to more female guards and </p><p>higher political attention, the societal view that leaves a </p><p>stigma where families refuse to take back women prisoners </p><p>remains a huge hurdle. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U)  The Ambassador noted improvements in the treatment </p><p>of citizens by security services while stressing that much </p><p>more needs to be done.  The Minister agreed that the </p><p>ignorance by which some police and security services treat </p><p>citizens needs to be comprehensively addressed.  The </p><p>Ambassador described the concept of community policing in the </p><p>United States and said it might be one way to address the </p><p>issue.  He offered to work with the Minister and the Minister </p><p>of the Interior to explore such programs that could possibly </p><p>be assisted by the USG. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U)  As a former journalist, the Minister agreed with the </p><p>Ambassador that the media situation could be improved.  While </p><p>much press freedom is allowed, journalists still often censor </p><p>themselves for fear of government reprisal.  They agreed that </p><p>journalists need to be more professional as well, and the </p><p>Ambassador offered potential USG assistance in this regard </p><p>via training and visitor programs. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C)  The previous Minister of State for Human Rights, </p><p>Waheeba Fara\'a, offered promise when she was appointed the </p><p>first woman ROYG minister, but that promise was never </p><p>realized to full potential.  This new appointment of a </p><p>dynamic and energetic Minister, who appears to intend to </p><p>accomplish concrete progress rather than rhetoric and who is </p><p>well-regarded by internationals and ROYG officials alike, </p><p>offers greater promise for Yemen to improve its human rights </p><p>record.  The Embassy intends to explore concrete ways to </p><p>assist in addition to ongoing programs, including improving </p><p>community policing and training the media.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>Biographic Note </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.
