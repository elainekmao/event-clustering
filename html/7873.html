<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 002694 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDAN TOURISM TAKES ANOTHER SHORT-TERM HIT </p><p> </p><p>1.  (sbu)  SUMMARY.  The war in Iraq was a new blow to the </p><p>Jordanian tourism industry, which was already reeling from </p><p>the fallout of the Intifada and September 11.  With the war\'s </p><p>impact reflected in cancellations that began in January, the </p><p>Jordanian tourist industry has basically written off the rest </p><p>of 2003.  They are  looking increasingly to developing </p><p>tourism within the region and are seeking large scale </p><p>government financial assistance.  Tourism promoters and </p><p>hoteliers are full of big ideas for developing Jordan\'s </p><p>excellent tourism potential, but they bemoan what they see as </p><p>a lack of interest by the government.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>Tourism Board: Cancellations Began in January </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (sbu)  Jordan Tourism Board (JTB) Executive Director </p><p>Marwan Khoury told econoff April 20 that the effects of the </p><p>war in Iraq started being felt in Jordan\'s toursim sector in </p><p>January, when uncertainty over the timing of the war led to a </p><p>reduction in air travel and a cancellation in bookings.  By </p><p>March, he said, virtually no foreign visitors were in the </p><p>country other than journalists and aid officials.  Since </p><p>nearly all of these stayed in "five star" hotels in Amman, </p><p>these hotels have been able to hang on, but the rest have </p><p>been critically impacted by the loss of visitor traffic. </p><p>Apart from occasional weekend travel by Jordanians to the </p><p>Dead Sea and Aqaba, tourist spots throughout Jordan have seen </p><p>"zero" travelers, with Petra hit particularly hard.  Several </p><p>smaller hotels in Petra have closed, at least temporarily, as </p><p>has the five star Movenpick Nabatean Castle Hotel.  An </p><p>unknown number of tour guides throughout the country have </p><p>lost work, and a few shops and stalls in Petra have also </p><p>closed or gone out of business.  The direct contribution of </p><p>tourism to GDP, which at one time was as high as 12%, has </p><p>dropped to 8.5% or lower, Khoury said.  The indirect losses </p><p>are much higher, he thought. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (sbu) Khoury said the JTB is continuing efforts begun </p><p>last year to shift its focus to working aggressively on </p><p>developing tourism from within the region.  (USAID has been </p><p>helping JTB redesign its strategy.)  He said this focus was a </p><p>bit successful, as Jordan had drawn tourists from Lebanon and </p><p>the Gulf, and had seen an increase in tourism the last three </p><p>months of 2002 over the same period in 2001.  He said this </p><p>campaign will continue, with regional efforts directed toward </p><p>developing summer camps in conjunction with the Jordanian </p><p>Hotel Association, and will have brochures promoting the </p><p>camps ready for distribution throughout the Gulf very soon. </p><p>He said he had another idea: to turn the busy commercial area </p><p>of Sweifieh in Amman into a pedestrian-only shopping area, </p><p>with cafes, outdoor music, etc.  He said he had received a </p><p>positive response to this idea from the Ministry of Tourism, </p><p>but nothing from the Amman municipality. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (sbu)  In terms of seeking new markets outside the </p><p>region, Khoury said that JTB had opened a new office in </p><p>Russia, as that country had recently been added to the list </p><p>of countries whose citizens are able to obtain entry visas at </p><p>the Amman airport.  He is planning to attend a trade show in </p><p>Moscow in May.  He added that the JTB is planning to do a </p><p>market research study on the Eastern European market. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (sbu)  When asked about contacts with Israeli tourism </p><p>officials and/or entities, he said he used to have "a quite </p><p>fruitful" relationship with the GOI Ministry of Tourism, but </p><p>said that "ever since Likud came to power" there has been no </p><p>cooperation despite attempts by the JTB to initiate dialogue. </p><p> Regarding possible links with Iraq, Khoury said he was </p><p>looking forward to establishing some kind of relationship </p><p>once a formal tourism entity was established.  He said that </p><p>to the best of his knowledge, Iraq had no tourist board or </p><p>ministry in recent memory, because "they never believed in </p><p>tourism." </p><p> </p><p>6.  (sbu)  Khoury closed by saying that the lifting of the </p><p>U.S. and other travel advisories for Jordan would be key to </p><p>spurring the return of U.S. and European visitors.  He noted </p><p>that the Netherlands and the UK had lifted their travel </p><p>advisories (note: they still have public notices advising </p><p>vigilance and, in the case of the UK a stiff warning on the </p><p>possibility of terrorism.) </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>Hotel Association: Down in the Dumps </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>7.  (sbu)  Michael Nazzal, President of the Jordan Hotel </p><p>Association, echoed Khoury\'s view regarding the travel </p><p>warning.   He said the removal of the warning would have a </p><p>great effect, because people would see it "crawling across </p><p>their tv screens as they watch CNN" and would think that it </p><p>was safe to come to Jordan.  Nazzal said hotels have more or </p><p>less "written off" European tourists for the year.  He said </p><p>instead they\'ll focus on the summer camp program in which </p><p>children from the region will stay at a camp, similar to Boy </p><p>Scout camps, he said, but with an Islamic twist.  The kids\' </p><p>families, of course, will stay in the hotels at a reduced </p><p>rate.  Brochures advertising the camps will be ready by May 1. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (sbu)  Nazzal expressed consternation at Jordan\'s </p><p>inability, as a country, to sell itself internationally as a </p><p>tourist destination.  He said that if one looks at Lebanon, </p><p>for example, even regionally, on LBC and other Arab satellite </p><p>networks, one "sees a beautiful country, with a vibrant, </p><p>exciting capital."  Nazzal said that one wouldn\'t see that </p><p>sort of thing on Jordanian TV, because it\'s "too weak" and </p><p>not interested in promoting Jordan.  He added that the </p><p>Ministry of Tourism did not have "a quality staff that was up </p><p>to the job" of helping the JHA and others. </p><p> </p><p>10. (sbu)  As to the compensation arrangement the JHA has </p><p>worked out with the government, Nazzal said it\'s based on a </p><p>formula that projects average revenue based on room occupancy </p><p>rates.  Actual revenue is subtracted from this figure, and </p><p>the government makes up the difference.  Nazzal was not sure </p><p>how the government was applying this approach to non-hotel </p><p>tourism providers who are suffering as well. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (sbu)  Nazzal came back to the idea he previosly shared </p><p>regarding his proposal to turn Petra into a Davos-type resort </p><p>focused on fashion and the arts.  He has drawn up a proposal </p><p>for this "Petra Club," and has forwarded it to the MOT, where </p><p>he\'s sure it will languish.  Nonetheless, it is an </p><p>interesting proposal, one that would bring artists from all </p><p>over the country to live and work in Petra.  For the fashion </p><p>piece, it includes the construction of a convention center </p><p>with goal to hosting annual fashion shows, seminars, and the </p><p>like. </p><p>BERRY </p><p></p></div>
