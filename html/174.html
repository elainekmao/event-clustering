<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 TUNIS 11327 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINR </p><p>SUBJECT: REACTION TO AND BACKGROUND ON TUNISIA\'S NEW </p><p>         PRIME MINISTER AND PARTY LEADER </p><p> </p><p>REF: TUNIS 11130 </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>ZINE EL ABIDINE BEN ALI </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. LOCAL AND FOREIGN REACTION TO ZINE EL ABIDINE BEN </p><p>ALI\'S APPOINTMENT AS PRIME MINISTER IS GENERALLY </p><p>POSITIVE.  AT HOME, HE IS RESPECTED AS A COMPETENT </p><p>HARD-WORKER SOMEWHAT ALOOF FROM THE USUAL POLITICAL </p><p>SQUABBLES.  HIS MILITARY BACKGROUND AND TENURE AT THE </p><p>MINISTRY OF INTERIOR, HOWEVER, LEAD MANY TUNISIANS TO </p><p>SUSPECT A HARDENING OF GOT\'S POSITION VIS-A-VIS </p><p>DISSENT, AN IMPRESSION THAT BEN ALI\'S INITIAL </p><p>STATEMENT AND RECENT EDITORIALS BASED ON THAT </p><p>STATEMENT HAVE TAKEN PAINS TO DISPEL.  THE FOREIGN </p><p>MEDIA, INCLUDING SUCH CRITICS OF RECENT DEVELOPMENTS </p><p>IN TUNISIA AS "LE MONDE", HAVE SPOKEN FAVORABLY OF </p><p>HIS APPOINTMENT.  CHARACTERIZING BEN ALI AS A "STRONG </p><p>MAN", LE MONDE OPINED THAT BEN ALI IS THE RIGHT MAN </p><p>FOR THE JOB AT THIS TIME.  GOT SEEMS PARTICULARLY </p><p>GRATIFIED BY THIS ENDORSEMENT FROM THE FOREIGN MEDIA </p><p>AND HAS GIVEN IT PROMINENT COVERAGE. </p><p> </p><p>3. ZINE EL ABIDINE BEN ALI WAS BORN AT HAMMAM SOUSSE, </p><p>A SMALL TOWN NEAR PRESIDENT BOURGUIBA\'S BIRTHPLACE OF </p><p>MONASTIR, ON 3 SEPTEMBER 1936.  HE STUDIED AT THE </p><p>MILITARY ACADEMY OF SAINT-CYR AND THE ARTILLERY </p><p>SCHOOL IN CHALONS SUR-MARNE IN FRANCE AND TOOK THE </p><p>SENIOR FOREIGN OFFICERS INTELLIGENCE COURSE AT FORT </p><p>HOLABIRD, MARYLAND, AND AN ARTILLERY COURSE AT FORT </p><p>BLISS, TEXAS.  HE BECAME DIRECTOR OF MILITARY </p><p>INTELLIGENCE IN 1958, A POSITION HE HELD FOR 16 YEARS </p><p>UNDER FOUR DIFFERENT DEFENSE MINISTERS.  IN 1974, BEN </p><p>ALI WAS SENT AS MILITARY ATTACHE TO RABAT.  ACCORDING </p><p>TO JEUNE AFRIQUE, THIS APPOINTMENT RESULTED FROM </p><p>PRESIDENT BOURGUIBA\'S SUSPICIONS WHEN BEN ALI\'S NAME </p><p>APPEARED ON A LIST OF PROJECTED APPOINTMENTS </p><p>RESULTING FROM THE STILL-BORN TUNISIAN/LIBYAN UNION </p><p>AGREEMENT.  KNOWN FOR HIS DISCIPLINE AND COMPETENCE, </p><p>BEN ALI WAS CALLED BACK TO TUNIS TO RUN THE BUREAU OF </p><p>NATIONAL SECURITY (SURETE NATIONALE) JUST BEFORE </p><p>LABOR STRIFE CULMINATED IN GOT\'S VIOLENT CRACKDOWN OF </p><p>THE GENERAL STRIKE OF 1978.  IN 1980 HE REPORTEDLY </p><p>RAN AFOUL OF MRS. WASSILA BOURGUIBA AND WAS SENT AWAY </p><p>TO BECOME AMBASSADOR TO POLAND.  IN THE AFTERMATH OF </p><p>THE VIOLENT BREAD RIOTS OF 1984, BEN ALI WAS RECALLED </p><p>TO THE DIRECTORSHIP OF NATIONAL SECURITY.  ON 28 </p><p>APRIL, HE WAS NAMED MINISTER OF INTERIOR AND IN </p><p>MID-MAY WAS PROMOTED TO MINISTER OF STATE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  WHILE HIS PUBLIC APPEARANCE IS SOMEWHAT AUSTERE, </p><p>BEN ALI IN PRIVATE DISPOSES OF CONSIDERABLE CHARM AND </p><p>RADIATES CONFIDENCE.  IN RECENT MONTHS, HE HAS </p><p>INCREASINGLY BEEN CALLED UPON TO EXPLAIN GOT SECURITY </p><p>POLICY IN PUBLIC MEETINGS AND WITH THE FOREIGN PRESS </p><p>AND HANDLED THESE SITUATIONS WELL.  HE HAS LITTLE </p><p>EXPERIENCE IN FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND ECONOMICS, AND WILL </p><p>HAVE TO RELY ON HIS MINISTERIAL COLLEAGUES IN THESE </p><p>AREAS AT LEAST INITIALLY.  HIS TENDENCY FOR </p><p>MICRO-MANAGEMENT OF THE SECURITY SERVICE MUST ALSO </p><p>CHANGE AS INDICATED BY THE APPOINTMENT OF MOHAMED </p><p>KARBOUL, A CAREER INTERIOR MINISTRY OFFICIAL, AS </p><p>DIRECTOR GENERAL OF NATIONAL SECURITY OCTOBER 6. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>MAHJOUB BEN ALI </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  MAHJOUB BEN ALI, THE NEW DESTOURIAN SOCIALIST </p><p>PARTY (PSD) CHIEF, IS THE MOST PROMINENT OF FIVE OR </p><p>SIX HARDLINERS THAT PRESIDENT BOURGUIBA HAS CALLED </p><p>BACK TO SERVICE IN THE RECENT MONTHS.  REACTION TO </p><p>MAHJOUB\'S APPOINTMENT IS GENERALLY NEGATIVE.  THE </p><p>EDUCATED ELITE IN PARTICULAR HAVE A LOW OPINION OF </p><p>HIM.  THEY SNEER AT HIS LACK OF FORMAL EDUCATION AND </p><p>DEEM HIM RIGID AND NARROW-MINDED. </p><p> </p><p>6.  MAHJOUB BEN ALI, 62, WAS BORN IN BIZERTE.  IN </p><p>1952 HE WAS PUT IN CHARGE OF ORGANIZING </p><p>PRE-INDEPENDENCE RESISTANCE TO THE FRENCH IN THE </p><p>NORTH AND BECAME A PRINCIPAL LEADER OF THE RESISTANCE </p><p>MOVEMENT.  MAHJOUB LED THE GUERILLA ATTACK ON A </p><p>BUSLOAD OF FRENCH CIVILIANS IN 1952 THAT BOURGUIBA </p><p>CREDITS WITH SHAKING FRANCE OUT OF ITS COMPLACENCY </p><p>ABOUT TUNISIA.  HE LED THE NATIONAL GUARD FROM 1956 </p><p>UNTIL 1967 WHEN HE WAS DISMISSED FOR FAILING TO </p><p>CONTROL ANTI-AMERICAN DEMONSTRATIONS IN THE WAKE OF </p><p>THE 6 DAY WAR.  HE THEN OCCUPIED A NUMBER OF LESSER </p><p>POSITIONS WHERE HE EARNED A REPUTATION FOR </p><p>HEAVY-HANDEDNESS.  IN THE WAKE OF THE BOMBINGS AT THE </p><p>TOURIST HOTELS LAST AUGUST, HE WAS APPOINTED DEPUTY </p><p>DIRECTOR OF THE PSD IN CHARGE OF THE VIGILANCE </p><p>COMMITTEES. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PELLETREAU </p><p></p></div>
