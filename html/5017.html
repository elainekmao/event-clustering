ADANA NGO OPPOSES U.S. LED WAR ON IRAQ </p><p>(Bolge)  As reactions to a possible US-led war in </p><p>Iraq increased, Suleyman Ozkan, President of the </p><p>Adana chapter of the Inmates and Prisoners\' </p><p>Families Assistance and Solidarity Association, </p><p>announced the United States wanted to drown the </p><p>Middle East in blood and tears.  Ozkan claimed the </p><p>U.S. wanted to drag Turkey into an environment with </p><p>irrecoverable losses although it had not dressed </p><p>the wounds from the 1991 Gulf Crisis.  Around 200 </p><p>association members expressed that they were </p><p>against war and asked for an end to anti-democratic </p><p>practices in prisons. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.

OHAL was </p><p>lifted in Van two years ago, and in Hakkari on </p><p>November 30, 2002.  The checkpoints are deemed </p><p>impediments to freedom of travel and trade. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.

A group of 30 youths lit a </p><p>fire on the roof of the building and threw roof </p><p>tiles at the police. The group returned to their </p><p>dormitories after the arrested person was released. </p><p>Afterwards, the police arrested the two suspects </p><p>and nine others, seizing many knives and lots of </p><p>wire. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.

Tankers waiting to dump fuel oil they </p><p>had brought in from northern Iraq have reportedly </p><p>formed a 20-kilometer-long queue at the refinery. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13.  ANTI-BIOLOGICAL AND CHEMICAL COMMITTEES FORMED </p><p>(Turkiye)  After determination by the Diyarbakir </p><p>Governor\'s Office of shelters to be used by the </p><p>public in the event of war on Iraq, the province\'s </p><p>Civil Defense Directorate formed an "Anti- </p><p>Biological and Chemical Struggle Committee."  The </p><p>committee is made up of teachers from the Science </p><p>Faculty and expert doctors from the Dicle </p><p>University (Diyarbakir) Hospital. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14.  RELIEF MATERIALS DISPATCHED TO IRAQI BORDER </p><p>(Turkiye)  Eight truckloads of relief materials </p><p>sent by the Turkish Red Crescent were unloaded in </p><p>Silopi (Sirnak) to cope with possible infiltration </p><p>of refugees in the event of war on Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15.  NGOS OPPOSE WAR, URGE UN DECISION </p><p>(Turkiye)  It was announced by representatives of </p><p>various chambers in Adana and Mersin that any war </p><p>not based on legitimate grounds is a crime against </p><p>humanity.  Business circles in Adana, Mersin and </p><p>Tarsus (Mersin) signed a joint declaration saying </p><p>that "the operation on Iraq for which the United </p><p>States is making preparations is not based on </p><p>legitimate grounds; all the states in the world, </p><p>particularly our country, should oppose this issue </p><p>unless a United Nations\' decision has been </p><p>obtained, and that the likely war would bring great </p><p>material and moral losses to our country, </p><p>especially to the Cukurova (Adana) region, and that </p><p>we announce to the public opinion that our country </p><p>should not take part in this war unless a United </p><p>Nations\' decision has been obtained". </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16.  INTERIOR MINISTRY BANS VILLAGE GUARDS FROM </p><p>POLITICS </p><p>(Evrensel)  A recently circulated Interior Ministry </p><p>decree bans Hakkari village guards from becoming </p><p>administrators or members of political parties. </p><p>Based on the decree, 140 village guards in Cukurca </p><p>(Hakkari) were summoned to the district Jandarma </p><p>Command in early December and were asked to resign </p><p>from their political parties; otherwise their </p><p>weapons would be confiscated.  This new decree has </p><p>affected mostly MHP and DYP, not DEHAP. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>17.  FAMILY PLANNING </p><p>(Cumhuriyet)  A report by the Diyarbakir Chamber of </p><p>Physicians revealed that women in the Southeast </p><p>have insufficient information about birth and </p><p>family planning.  While 61% of women do not get any </p><p>pre-delivery medical care, 58% do not use any birth </p><p>control methods.  Fifty-four per cent of births </p><p>take place at home and 0.062 of babies are </p><p>stillborn, while the infant mortality rate is 0.076 </p><p>per cent.  The report noted that it was mandated by </p><p>law to get a spouse\'s consent for sterilization, </p><p>and that there were claims of forced birth-control </p><p>methods in the region.  The report emphasized that </p><p>it was up to the individual to choose any birth- </p><p>control methods after being informed adequately. </p><p>"The OHAL Regional Governor\'s teams should be </p><p>removed from family planning services.  While these </p><p>services are being rendered, modern, scientific, </p><p>legal, and moral principles should not be </p><p>neglected.  Especially legation of tubes </p><p>(sterilization) should only be applied on a </p><p>voluntary basis, not through any incentives, </p><p>persuasion, or pressure," the report said. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>18.  ADANA\'S SEYHAN DISTRICT MAYOR TO JOIN CHP </p><p>(Bolge)  It is claimed that Adana\'s Seyhan district </p><p>mayor, Yildiray Arikan, who plans to run for mayor </p><p>of Adana, has increased his efforts to join CHP, as </p><p>his party, YTP, has very little popularity.  It is </p><p>alleged that he will join CHP between January 14- </p><p>17. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ECONOMIC AND AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENTS </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>19.  MALATYA HOSPITAL EMPLOYEES FIRED </p><p>(Evrensel)  In the Turgut Ozal Medical Center, </p><p>affiliated with Malatya\'s Inonu University, where a </p><p>chapter of the national Health Union (Saglik-Sen) </p><p>is getting organized, 122 workers were terminated, </p><p>in addition to the 22 workers terminated a month </p><p>ago.  The terminated workers claimed that they had </p><p>received warnings that they should not register </p><p>with the union; otherwise, they would be </p><p>terminated.  They added that Rector Dr. Fatih </p><p>Hilmioglu was backing the sacking of workers. </p><p>HOLTZ </p><p></p></div>
