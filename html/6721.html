<p>S E C R E T ROME 001228 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FOR NP/CBM AND INR/SPM </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 1.6 (X1,X6) </p><p>TAGS: PARM, PREL, ETTC, IR, IT, EXPORT CONTROLS </p><p>SUBJECT: S63-03 IRANIAN ENTITIES SEEKING TO PROCURE CBW </p><p>MATERIAL FROM AG COUNTRIES </p><p> </p><p>REF: SECSTATE 71539 </p><p></p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: ECONOMIC COUNSELOR KAREN MILLIKEN. REASON: 1.5 (C AND D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (S) ECONOFF DELIVERED REFTEL POINTS TO MFA EXPORT CONTROL </p><p>COORDINATOR UGO DE MOHR ON MARCH 21.  DE MOHR (WHO HAS </p><p>REASSUMED HIS POSITION FOLLOWING AN EXTENDED ABSENCE) </p><p>WELCOMED THE RECEIPT OF FURTHER INFORMATION FROM THE U.S., </p><p>FOLLOWING UP TO RECENT DISCUSSIONS AMONG AUSTRALIA GROUP </p><p>MEMBERS OF IRANIAN EFFORTS TO PROCURE CBW MATERIAL FROM AG </p><p>COUNTRIES. DE MOHR NOTED, HOWEVER, THAT OUR INFORMATION WOULD </p><p>BE EVEN MORE USEFUL IF THERE WAS SOME INDICATION OF WHEN SUCH </p><p>PROCUREMENT ATTEMPTS OCCURRED AND AT WHAT FREQUENCY, AS A </p><p>MEANS OF DETECTING PATTERNS THAT MIGHT ASSIST OTHER AG </p><p>MEMBERS IN HALTING SUCH EFFORTS.  HE FURTHER COMMENTED THAT </p><p>THE GOI HAD IN THE PAST PROHIBITED EXPORTS TO THE IRANIAN </p><p>PASTEUR INSTITUTE (IPI) AFTER THE IRANIANS HAD REJECTED THE </p><p>DETAILED LEVEL OF INSPECTIONS ON WHICH THE GOI CONDITIONED </p><p>SUCH EXPORTS (THOUGH HE SAID ITALY NEVER SAW FIRM EVIDENCE </p><p>THAT THE IPI WAS INVOLVED IN ANY ACTIVITY OF CONCERN). </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) FOLLOWING UP ON THE AUSTRALIA GROUP MEETING IN </p><p>JANUARY, DE MOHR FAVORABLY NOTED THE U.S. INITIATIVE TO DRAFT </p><p>AND CIRCULATE A PAPER ON STREAMLINING THE PROCESS OF </p><p>INTRODUCING NEW ITEMS TO THE CONTROLLED LIST.  DE MOHR IS </p><p>LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING THE DRAFT.  MORE GENERALLY, HE </p><p>NOTED THAT THE CIRCULATION OF PAPERS FOR AG MEETINGS WAS </p><p>INCREASINGLY OCCURRING VERY CLOSE TO MEETING DATES, MAKING IT </p><p>DIFFICULT FOR AG MEMBER GOVERNMENTS, INCLUDING THE GOI, TO </p><p>CARRY OUT ESSENTIAL INTERNAL DISCUSSIONS TO ALLOW A </p><p>SUBSTANTIVE REACTION DURING THE MEETING. HE SUGGESTED </p><p>CIRCULATION OF PAPERS AT LEAST TWO MONTHS BEFORE A MEETING </p><p>    WOULD BE IDEAL. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE: WE WERE SURPRISED TO LEARN OF DE </p><p>MOHR\'S RETURN TO HIS OLD JOB, APPROXIMATELY ONE MONTH AFTER </p><p>HIS ASSISTANT TOLD US HE HAD QUIT THE POSITION AFTER BEING </p><p>PASSED OVER FOR AN AMBASSADORIAL ASSIGNMENT.  ACCORDING TO </p><p>HIS ASSISTANT, DE MOHR IS APPROACHING THE MFA\'S MANDATORY </p><p>RETIREMENT AGE, AND NEEDS TO RECEIVE SUCH AN APPOINTMENT SOON </p><p>IN ORDER TO SPEND A FULL TOUR OVERSEAS.  HE APPARENTLY HOPES </p><p>THAT AN APPOINTMENT WILL BE FORTHCOMING NEAR THE END OF THIS </p><p>YEAR. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p>	2003ROME01228 - Classification: SECRET </p><p></p><p></p></div>
