<p>UNCLAS HARARE 002617 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PD, AF/S, AF/RA, AF/PDPA </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: GOVERNMENT NEWSPAPER REPLAYS CARTER CRITICISM OF </p><p>PRESIDENT BUSH </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.  Under headline Bush needs political education the </p><p>      government-controlled daily "Chronicle" used its </p><p>      November 18 editorial to urge President Bush to take </p><p>      advice from former President Carter. Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.  ". . .The United States is in the forefront of </p><p>      calling for the disarmament of Iraq which is </p><p>      believed to have weapons of mass destruction but it </p><p>      is not prepared to lead the way by disarming itself. </p><p>      It is also known for preaching abstractions such a </p><p>      democracy, good governance and the rule of law but </p><p>      evidence on the ground does not show that it is </p><p>      practicing these values.  U.S. President George W. </p><p>      Bush and his British ally Tony Blair are threatening </p><p>      to attack Iraq should it not disarm. . .  Former </p><p>      U.S. president Jimmy Carter and this year\'s Nobel </p><p>      Peace price winner on Friday exposed the U.S.\'s </p><p>      hypocrisy when he said while the U.S. was leading </p><p>      the crusade for countries such as North Korea and </p><p>      Iraq to disarm, it is in fact building up dangerous </p><p>      weapons itself. . .  The 78-year old statesman also </p><p>      said that there was a feeling among other nations </p><p>      that the U.S. has become too arrogant, too dominant </p><p>      and too self-centered. . .\' and wants to control the </p><p>      world.  The former U.S. leader has made a pertinent </p><p>      observation and we hope the Bush administration will </p><p>      listen to this voice of reason.  It does not need a </p><p>      rocket scientist to tell that the U.S. is </p><p>      unnecessarily pushing its weight around accusing </p><p>      small nations of all sorts of things,  The question </p><p>      that many peace-loving people in the global village </p><p>      are asking is, who will police the Americans who </p><p>      appear to have declared themselves as world </p><p>      \'watchdog.\' </p><p> </p><p>      "Recently a Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of </p><p>      State for African Affairs in the U.S. government </p><p>      Mark Bellamy said his government was considering </p><p>      "all approaches\' to distribute food directly to </p><p>      villagers.  The U.S. Government has for sometime now </p><p>      been accusing the government of Zimbabwe of failing </p><p>      to comply with the basic principles of democracy and </p><p>      human rights violations.  We are also wondering </p><p>      whether Bush\'s win of that country\'s controversial </p><p>      presidential election through the courts can be </p><p>      defined by all standards as democrac" at play.  It </p><p>      is for this reason that we implore Bush to seek </p><p>      advice from the likes of Carter for better a America </p><p>      and a better world for all - big and small." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
