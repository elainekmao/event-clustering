Novak, Charge d\'Affaires. </p><p>Reasons:  1.5 (b, d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  In the aftermath of the June 14 </p><p>sinking of a Tiger ship, the GSL is trying to calm the </p><p>situation, assuring the Tigers that it is looking into </p><p>ways to devolve power to the north/east.  Minister </p><p>Moragoda, a key adviser to the PM, has expressed deep </p><p>concerns to us about the navy\'s handling of the </p><p>incident.  The Tigers remain very, very sore over the </p><p>sinking of their ship.  Despite the GSL\'s best efforts, </p><p>a bit of tension remains in the air.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>GSL Reaches Out </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) In the aftermath of the sinking of a </p><p>Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) ship on June 14, </p><p>the GSL is trying to calm the situation.  (Note:  Per </p><p>Ref B, the ship sank off the northeast coast during a </p><p>confrontation with the Sri Lankan Navy, "SLN," and </p><p>all 12 of its crew are believed dead.  It remains </p><p>unclear whether the crew of the ship detonated it or </p><p>whether it was sunk by SLN gunfire.  The SLN insists </p><p>that the Tigers destroyed the ship.)  In response to a </p><p>question at a June 16 press conference, G.L. Peiris, a </p><p>minister and the GSL\'s key peace process negotiator, </p><p>said the June 14 incident did not increase the risk of </p><p>war because the LTTE had promised it would not go down </p><p>that route again.  Peiris added that the Norwegian-run </p><p>Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission (SLMM) was looking into the </p><p>incident and would report on ways to avoid similar </p><p>incidents in the future. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Regarding the peace process in general, Peiris </p><p>related that the government was putting together new </p><p>proposals in an effort to break the ongoing stalemate. </p><p>(Note:  The LTTE pulled out of the peace talks in late </p><p>April and refused to attend the recent Tokyo donors </p><p>conference.  The LTTE is demanding the immediate </p><p>formation of an interim structure in the north/east, </p><p>which it would basically control.)  Peiris said the </p><p>government was thinking of recommending the formation of </p><p>"district development committees" in the handful of </p><p>districts comprising the north/east.  These committees </p><p>-- perhaps acting in conjunction with "special </p><p>commissioners" -- would be empowered to distribute </p><p>assistance, including some of that garnered from the </p><p>international community at the recent Tokyo conference. </p><p>Peiris remarked that these proposals would take some </p><p>more time to formulate.  The GSL hoped, however, to meet </p><p>face-to-face with the LTTE soon to discuss them -- "It </p><p>is necessary that the parties talk to each other to </p><p>carry the process forward," he said.  He stressed that </p><p>the proposals, if agreed to, would be only "temporary </p><p>measures" subject to further GSL-LTTE discussions re </p><p>forming some sort of interim arrangement in the </p><p>north/east. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) (((Note:  At the press conference, Peiris was </p><p>also asked about the recent assassination in Jaffna of </p><p>an anti-LTTE Tamil politician.  Peiris said the police </p><p>were investigating the incident and it would be handled </p><p>as a criminal matter.  Per Ref B, the Jaffna slaying was </p><p>perhaps the most brazen of about 30 similar killings </p><p>which have taken place this year.  The killings are </p><p>almost certainly being perpetrated by the LTTE.  End </p><p>Note.))) </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>Key Minister\'s Concerns re Navy </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) In his comments on the ship incident, Milinda </p><p>Moragoda, another key minister working on peace process </p><p>issues, told the Ambassador late June 16 that he had </p><p>deep concerns about the navy\'s handling of the matter. </p><p>Moragoda said as far as he understood the SLN had failed </p><p>to keep the SLMM fully informed of its actions. </p><p>Moreover, the SLN had not placed a monitor on board its </p><p>ships before commencing the operation, which should have </p><p>been standard procedure during the cease-fire. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) In parenthetical remarks, Moragoda said he also </p><p>had serious worries about command-and-control issues </p><p>related to the navy.  The government, for example, was </p><p>not informed of the SLN\'s actions on June 14.  There was </p><p>some indication, Moragoda continued, that the SLN had </p><p>briefed President Kumaratunga, but Prime Minister </p><p>Wickremesinghe was not kept in the loop.  (Note: </p><p>Kumaratunga and Wickremesinghe share a tense </p><p>cohabitation relationship.)  Admiral Sandagiri, the </p><p>commander of the navy who was in Hawaii for meetings at </p><p>CINCPAC, had also apparently been informed of what was </p><p>transpiring.  Moragoda noted that the SLN had also not </p><p>been fully in touch with the government re its </p><p>activities during a previous incident in March in which </p><p>a LTTE boat was sunk in similar circumstances.  Moragoda </p><p>was not clear whether the GSL planned to take action </p><p>against the navy in this instance, but he indicated that </p><p>the government was looking into the matter. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>Tigers Remain Angry </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) As for the LTTE, the group has had no further </p><p>comments re the sinking of its ship since its June 15 </p><p>letter to the SLMM.  (Note:  In the letter, the LTTE </p><p>complained in harsh tones about the SLN\'s actions in </p><p>intercepting the LTTE\'s ship, which the group said was </p><p>only an "oil tanker" -- See Ref B.)  In a June 17 </p><p>conversation, however, Joseph Pararajahsingham, a MP for </p><p>the Tamil National Alliance with very close LTTE links, </p><p>told us that the group remained "extremely angry with </p><p>the navy over the sinking of the ship." </p><p>Pararajahsingham said the LTTE felt that the sinking was </p><p>"totally uncalled for" and a clear violation of the </p><p>February 2002 ceasefire agreement.  When asked, </p><p>Pararajahsingham was not clear what the LTTE might do in </p><p>response, but he said the group was still committed to </p><p>the peace process.  Queried about Peiris\' comments, he </p><p>replied that the idea for "district development </p><p>committees" was an old one and he doubted the Tigers had </p><p>any interest in discussing the matter. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) (((Note:  In his comments to the Ambassador, </p><p>Moragoda noted that the Norwegian government </p><p>facilitators were having no luck enticing the Tigers </p><p>back to the peace talks.  Moragoda said Anton </p><p>Balasingham, the LTTE\'s London-based chief negotiator, </p><p>remained virtually incommunicado.  In the meantime, </p><p>Mission has been told by Japanese embassy sources that </p><p>the GoJ has also been unable to arrange meetings with </p><p>the LTTE in order to brief the group on what happened at </p><p>the Tokyo conference.  End Note.))) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) In his June 16 comments, Peiris was clearly </p><p>trying to calm things down.  Based on what we are </p><p>hearing, however, his remarks did not mollify the </p><p>Tigers, who remain very, very disturbed over the attack </p><p>on their ship and the apparent loss of their personnel. </p><p>It is still unclear whether the group plans to take some </p><p>sort of action to make its displeasure felt beyond its </p><p>complaint to the monitors about the navy.  Until the </p><p>Tigers\' precise course of action is clear, however, some </p><p>tension will remain in the air. </p><p>10.  (C) As for Moragoda\'s comments, the apparent </p><p>failure of the navy to bring the matter to the attention </p><p>of the government represents a real breach in civilian </p><p>control of the armed forces.  One would think the prime </p><p>minister would have to react to such a snub, but his </p><p>situation is a tricky one and a dressing down of the </p><p>navy is quite possibly something he might choose to </p><p>avoid.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>NOVAK </p><p></p></div>
