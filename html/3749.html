<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 005348 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARN, NEA/PA, NEA/AIA, INR/NESA, R/MR, </p><p>I/GNEA, B/BXN, B/BRN, NEA/PPD, NEA/IPA FOR ALTERMAN </p><p>USAID/ANE/MEA </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH </p><p>PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p>USCINCCENT//CCPA, USCENTCOM REAR MACDILL AFB FL </p><p>STATE PASS TO AID </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p> </p><p>TAGS: KMDR JO </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON MIDDLE EAST DEVELOPMENTS </p><p> </p><p>                        Summary </p><p> </p><p>-- Lead stories in the Jordanian media over the past </p><p>few days, September 13-17, focuses on a number of </p><p>developments related to Iraq and Peace Process issues. </p><p>Highlighted stories focus on Iraq\'s "unconditional" </p><p>approval of  return of the weapons inspectors to Iraq; </p><p>the Saudi Foreign Minister\'s remarks about Saudi </p><p>willingness to cooperate in "any U.N.-endorsed strike </p><p>on Iraq"; and President Bush\'s address to the U.N. </p><p>General Assembly about Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>                 Editorial Commentary </p><p> </p><p>-- "Rhetorical stances will not solve the region\'s </p><p>crisis" </p><p> </p><p>Semi-official, influential Arabic daily Al-Ra\'i </p><p>(09/17) editorializes:  "Moving the Iraqi file to the </p><p>United Nations constituted a positive step for </p><p>American diplomacy.  This means that the Arabs must </p><p>not simply rebut with rhetoric and speeches that were </p><p>used during the Cold War,  and before (the attacks of) </p><p>September 11 and its repercussions.  Arabs must </p><p>instead search boldly and realistically for a new form </p><p>of rhetoric that protects their principles and their </p><p>rights and that establishes a new and  balanced </p><p>formula that does not fall to the favor of the </p><p>interests of opponents and enemies." </p><p> </p><p>-- "Before the countdown to war begins" </p><p> </p><p>Center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(09/17) editorializes:  "The bad omen already clear in </p><p>the Iraqi issue now is how the situation in the </p><p>Palestinian territories could develop should a war in </p><p>the Gulf region start again.  It is expected that </p><p>Sharon would take advantage of the war atmosphere to </p><p>the maximum in order to implement his hellish plans </p><p>against the Palestinian people, including the transfer </p><p>of as many Palestinians as he could.  We call on the </p><p>Arab leaders to make good use of the time left, before </p><p>the United States begins its final countdown to this, </p><p>to intensify their diplomatic efforts and their </p><p>international contacts not only to spare Iraq the </p><p>destruction and division, but also to spare the </p><p>Palestinian people the tragedy of another transfer." </p><p> </p><p>-- "Check on implementation" </p><p> </p><p>Centrist, influential among the elite, English daily </p><p>Jordan Times (09/17) editorializes:  "In his address </p><p>to the 57the session of the U.N. General Assembly, </p><p>U.S. President George Bush lashed out at the U.N. </p><p>system for lacking what he called "backbone" in </p><p>standing up to Iraq.  By describing the United Nations </p><p>as inept and ineffective, he called on the </p><p>international organization to get its act together </p><p>against the dangers posed by the Iraqi regime or let </p><p>the United States do the job! By taking on the United </p><p>Nations as well as Iraq, the U.S. President opened a </p><p>Pandora\'s box on an issue that goes beyond Iraq and </p><p>its alleged possession of weapons of mass destruction </p><p>and touches other imminent regional threats.  Do we </p><p>dare ask why the resolutions on the Palestinian </p><p>question remain ink on paper?  Is it not true that </p><p>these resolutions have yet to be implemented because </p><p>of Washington\'s opposition to them?  That is why in </p><p>addressing the issue of the ineffectiveness of the </p><p>U.N. system we must not single out Iraq but also point </p><p>to other disputes over which the U.N. system failed to </p><p>demonstrate the necessary brawn to deal with them." </p><p> </p><p>-- "Will America let the Security Council establish </p><p>security?" </p><p> </p><p>Center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(09/14) editorializes:  "The United States insists on </p><p>letting the world hear the drums of war beating </p><p>against Iraq.  Most world countries were relieved </p><p>about the American move to transfer the crisis with </p><p>Iraq to the United Nations.  This means that </p><p>Washington, for the time being at least, has given up </p><p>on the idea of striking Iraq unilaterally.  Let the </p><p>U.S. administration then allow the Security Council to </p><p>act upon their international responsibilities and </p><p>commitment to world peace.  Let Washington allow the </p><p>Security Council itself to decide the extent of Iraq\'s </p><p>commitment to implementing Security Council </p><p>resolutions and recommendations and then decide </p><p>whether to use force.  We wonder, is it in the </p><p>interest of world peace and security to jump over the </p><p>dead bodies of Palestinians and their rights to be </p><p>free and independent from the claws of nuclear </p><p>empowered state and focus on an Arab country besieged </p><p>for the past twelve years in order to search for </p><p>weapons of mass destruction that have already been </p><p>eliminated in a world war?"
