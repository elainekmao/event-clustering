(C)   AT THE END OF A DECEMBER 13 MEETING WITH A/DCM ON A </p><p>SEPARATE ISSUE, BERLUSCONI FOREIGN POLICY ADVISOR GIANPAOLO </p><p>SCARANTE REQUESTED "INFORMAL" USG VIEWS ON THE POSSIBLE </p><p>RENEWAL OF A LONG-FROZEN SALE OF AGUSTA HELICOPTER PARTS TO </p><p>IRAN, CURRENTLY UNDER REVIEW WITHIN THE GOI. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)    ACCORDING TO SCARANTE, IN 1993 THE ITALIAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT FROZE AGUSTA\'S $25 MILLION CONTRACT TO DELIVER </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  06098  231347Z </p><p>HELICOPTER SPARE PARTS TO THE IRANIAN GOVERNMENT.  THE LEGAL </p><p>BASIS FOR THAT ACTION, HE SAID, WAS THE UNCHR RESOLUTION ON </p><p>IRAN IN EFFECT AT THAT TIME.  IN THE YEARS THAT FOLLOWED, AS </p><p>LONG AS SUCH A RESOLUTION REMAINED IN EFFECT, THE GOI WAS </p><p>ABLE TO MAINTAIN ITS FREEZE ON THE SALE.  WITHOUT A UNCHR </p><p>RESOLUTION ON IRAN THIS YEAR, HOWEVER, SCARANTE SAID THE GOI </p><p>HAD TO REVIEW WHETHER IT COULD CONTINUE TO HOLD UP DELIVERY </p><p>OF THE SPARE PARTS.  IN THIS CONTEXT, HE SAID HE WOULD </p><p>APPRECIATE A "LOW-KEYED, INFORMAL" USG VIEW ON ITALY\'S </p><p>LETTING THIS SALE GO FORWARD. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  ON DECEMBER 18, ECMIN PHONED SCARANTE TO CONVEY THAT </p><p>THE USG WOULD NOT/NOT FAVOR ITALY\'S ALLOWING THE PARTS TO BE </p><p>DELIVERED.  HE REMINDED SCARANTE THAT THE LONG-STANDING U.S. </p><p>EMBARGO OF MOST ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS WITH IRAN </p><p>REFLECTS OUR CONTINUED STRONG CONCERN WITH IRAN\'S PURSUIT OF </p><p>WMD AND BALLISTIC MISSILES, CONTINUING HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>VIOLATIONS, SUPPORT FOR INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM, AND </p><p>UNHELPFUL ACTIONS VIS-A-VIS AFGHANISTAN AND MIDDLE EAST </p><p>PEACE.  WE LIKEWISE STRONGLY ENCOURAGED OTHER COUNTRIES TO </p><p>LIMIT THEIR TRADE WITH IRAN.  ECMIN ALSO URGED THE GOI TO </p><p>EXAMINE THE SALE CLOSELY IN THE CONTEXT OF ITALY\'S </p><p>OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE WASSENAAR ARRANGEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  SCARANTE, WITHOUT ARGUING ANY OF THE ABOVE POINTS, </p><p>REITERATED THAT THE AGUSTA SALE WAS SIMPLY UNDER GOI REVIEW </p><p>AT THE PRESENT TIME, AND THAT USG VIEWS WOULD BE "AN </p><p>IMPORTANT FACTOR" IN THAT REVIEW.  ECMIN EXPRESSED </p><p>APPRECIATION FOR SCARANTE\'S HAVING CONTACTED THE U.S. </p><p>EMBASSY, AND URGED THAT THE GOI OFFER US THE OPPORTUNITY TO </p><p>CONSULT MORE FORMALLY IF THERE WAS ANY SERIOUS CHANCE THAT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  06098  231347Z </p><p>THE FREEZE MIGHT BE LIFTED.  SCARANTE INDICATED THAT THE GOI </p><p>WOULD STAY IN TOUCH. </p><p> </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME06098 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
