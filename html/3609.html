THE POPE DESCRIBED THE WORLD AS </p><p>"INCREASINGLY INTERDEPENDENT" AND SAID WE HAVE A DIVINE CALL </p><p>TO CULTIVATE AND PROTECT THE EARTH, ITS PEOPLE AND </p><p>RESOURCES.  HE EMPHASIZED THAT PEACE, JUSTICE AND THE </p><p>PROTECTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT CAN ONLY BE THE FRUIT OF </p><p>COMMON EFFORT BY ALL HUMANITY - RICH AND POOR. </p><p> </p><p>2.  THE HOLY SEE DELEGATION WILL BE LED BY ARCHBISHOP RENATO </p><p>MARTINO, THE HOLY SEE\'S PERMANENT OBSERVER TO THE UNITED </p><p>NATIONS.  ARCHBISHOP MARTINO TOLD REPORTERS AUGUST 26 THAT </p><p>THE FIRST PRINCIPLE OF THE RIO DECLARATION -- HUMAN BEINGS </p><p>ARE AT THE CENTER OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT CONCERNS -- </p><p>WOULD BE THE BASIS FOR HIS DELEGATION\'S PARTICIPATION IN </p><p>JOHANNESBURG.  THE RIO DOCUMENT\'S INSISTENCE ON THE PRIMACY </p><p>OF THE PERSON IN DEVELOPMENT ISSUES WAS, ACCORDING TO </p><p>MARTINO, A KEY HOLY SEE OBJECTIVE AT THAT MEETING. (COMMENT: </p><p>IN PRACTICAL TERMS FOR JOHANNESBURG THIS IMPLIES THAT THE </p><p>HOLY SEE WILL NOT BE WEDDED TO ANY PARTICULAR STRATEGY, </p><p>PARTNERSHIP, BENCHMARK OR DEADLINE UNLESS IT PROMOTES THE </p><p>VATICAN\'S TRADITIONAL PRIORITY OF THE VALUE OF THE HUMAN </p><p>PERSON, FAMILY, AND SOCIETY.

THE HOLY SEE\'S VIEWS ON PROMOTING GOOD GOVERNANCE TRACK </p><p>CLOSELY WITH U.S. PERSPECTIVES.  THEIR PREPARATORY PAPER </p><p>HIGHLIGHTS THE IMPORTANCE OF GOOD GOVERNANCE, PARTICULARLY </p><p>IN REGARD TO FIGHTING CORRUPTION, PROMOTING GREATER </p><p>DEMOCRATIC PARTICIPATION, ESTABLISHING WELL-FUNCTIONING </p><p>BUREAUCRACIES AND REGULATORY SYSTEMS, ENFORCING LAWS, AND </p><p>PROTECTING HUMAN RIGHTS.  THEY CONCLUDE THAT "THE LACK OF </p><p>STABLE INSTITUTIONS AND SOUND POLICIES ARE OFTEN A CAUSE OF </p><p>POVERTY, ONES THAT EVEN INCREASED LEVELS OF DEVELOPMENT </p><p>ASSISTANCE CANNOT OVERCOME.
