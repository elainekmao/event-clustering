(U) CLASSIFIED BY PETER W. GALBRAITH, AMBASSADOR, </p><p>PER 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S) CROATIAN FM GRANIC TOLD CHARGE FINN DECEMBER 29 </p><p>THAT THE GOC WAS CONCERNED BY REPORTS FROM NEW YORK </p><p>THAT THE U.S. WAS "SUPPORTING" A RUSSIAN-SPONSORED </p><p>CONDEMNATION OF CROATIA\'S HUMAN RIGHTS RECORD.  WAS </p><p>THIS, HE ASKED, A CHANGE IN POLICY?  GRANIC </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGED CROATIA HAD "MADE MISTAKES," BUT ARGUED IT </p><p>WAS WORKING HARD TO CORRECT PROBLEMS AND, MAKING CLEAR </p><p>THERE WAS SOME SPACE BETWEEN HIMSELF AND OTHERS IN THE </p><p>GOC ON THESE ISSUES, EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT A </p><p>RESOLUTION LIKE THAT THE RUSSIANS WERE PUSHING WOULD </p><p>DAMAGE PROSPECTS FOR CROATIA-SERBIA NORMALIZATION, </p><p>REINTEGRATION OF EASTERN SLAVONIA, AND PEACE IN B-H. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  CHARGE ASSURED GRANIC THERE WAS NO SHIFT IN </p><p>U.S. POLICY, BUT RATHER CONTINUITY -- CROATIA\'S HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS PROBLEMS WERE AND WOULD REMAIN A SERIOUS U.S. </p><p>CONCERN, ESPECIALLY SO LONG AS GOC STATEMENTS ABOUT </p><p>REMEDIES WERE NOT FOLLOWED UP WITH EFFECTIVE ACTION. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p>GRANIC REVIEWS CROATIA\'S POLITICAL, HUMAN RIGHTS RECORD </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  05299  01 OF 02  291641Z </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  CHARGE WAS SUMMONED TO THE MFA DECEMBER 29 FOR </p><p>A MEETING WITH FM GRANIC.  ALSO PRESENT WERE ASSISTANT </p><p>MINISTER FOR BILATERAL AFFAIRS BISCEVIC, CHEF DE </p><p>CABINET MATEK, DIRECTOR FOR NORTH AMERICA GRABAR, AND </p><p>U.S. EMBASSY POLOFF. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  RECALLING HIS RECENT "VERY PRODUCTIVE" TALKS </p><p>WITH SECRETARY CHRISTOPHER, GRANIC EMPHASIZED THAT </p><p>CROATIA WISHED TO COOPERATE FULLY IN THE IMPLEMENTATION </p><p>OF DAYTON, AND HAD DONE SO, ESPECIALLY REGARDING THE </p><p>ZUPANJA AREA.  (CHARGE OBSERVED THAT THIS WAS CORRECT </p><p>AND WAS MUCH APPRECIATED.)  GRANIC ADDED THAT THE GOC </p><p>WOULD SEND A DELEGATION TO THE DISARMAMENT TALKS IN </p><p>VIENNA AND COOPERATE FULLY IN EFFORTS THERE.  HE NOTED </p><p>PROGRESS IN EASTERN SLAVONIA, WITH MG KLEIN CURRENTLY </p><p>IN ZAGREB, A UNSC RESOLUTION EXPECTED SOON, AND SOME </p><p>PROGRESS ON THE NECESSARY TROOP CONTINGENTS.  IT HAD </p><p>BEEN AGREED DECEMBER 27 THAT HE WOULD VISIT BELGRADE </p><p>JANUARY 10 (WEATHER PERMITTING).  THERE WAS "NO DOUBT" </p><p>THAT CROATIA WOULD COOPERATE FULLY IN THE NORMALIZATION </p><p>PROCESS WITH SERBIA. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS PRESSURE COULD DELAY NORMALIZATION </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) IN THIS CONTEXT, HOWEVER, THE UNSYG\'S REPORT ON </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS MIGHT BE COUNTERPRODUCTIVE.  CROATIA HAD </p><p>"SHOWN WHAT IT IS DOING NOW," AND HAD TAKEN MANY STEPS </p><p>TO CLEAN UP ITS ACT AND PREVENT FURTHER "MISTAKES," </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  05299  01 OF 02  291641Z </p><p>ESPECIALLY IN THE PAST FEW MONTHS.  THE GOC HAD MADE </p><p>CLEAR ITS POLICY WOULD BE TO PROSECUTE ALL CRIMES.  ON </p><p>DECEMBER 27, THE GOVERNMENT HAD "RESOLVED THE QUESTION </p><p>OF PROPERTY," AND ON DECEMBER 28 IT HAD MET TO WORK UP </p><p>ITS "PROPOSAL" TO THE SABOR ON THIS.  THE HAGUE </p><p>TRIBUNAL WAS SENDING INVESTIGATORS TO CROATIA JANUARY </p><p>4-5 AND THEY WOULD HAVE FULL COOPERATION. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>U.S. COOPERATING WITH RUSSIA TO PRESSURE THE GOC </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) BUT RUSSIA HAD SEIZED ON THE BOUTROS-GHALI </p><p>REPORT TO PUSH IN THE UNSC FOR A RESOLUTION ON HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS IN CROATIA.  ON DECEMBER 28, THE U.S. REP HAD </p><p>SUPPORTED THE RUSSIAN APPROACH, USING RATHER STRONG </p><p>LANGUAGE.  "WE KNOW THAT YOU HAD PRESSURE FROM </p><p>MILOSEVIC," GRANIC SAID, BUT PRESSURE ON THE GOC NOW </p><p>WOULD NOT BE HELPFUL.  IT WAS ENTIRELY LEGITIMATE THAT </p><p> </p><p>THE U.S., NOW AS IN THE PAST, OFFER "CRITICAL </p><p>SUGGESTIONS" ON HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES, WHICH STIMULATED </p><p>DISCUSSION AND REMEDIAL ACTION.

(S) THE U.S. REP, GRANIC CLAIMED, HAD FOR THE FIRST </p><p>TIME SEEMINGLY "LED" AN EFFORT TO PUT PRESSURE ON THE </p><p>GOC ALONE.  GRANIC ASKED FOR AN EXPLANATION OF THE U.S. </p><p>ACTION IN NEW YORK; WAS THIS, HE ASKED, A "CHANGE OF </p><p>POLICY" TOWARD CROATIA?  CHARGE, NOTING HE HAD NOT YET </p><p>RECEIVED ANY REPORTS OF PROCEEDINGS IN NEW YORK </p><p>DECEMBER 28, SAID U.S. POLICY ON CROATIA HAD NOT </p><p>"SHIFTED," NOR WAS IT DRIVEN BY ANY PRESSURE FROM </p><p>MILOSEVIC.  HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES WERE A LONGSTANDING AND </p><p>MAJOR COMPONENT OF U.S. FOREIGN POLICY; SERIOUS HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS ABUSES HAD BEEN COMMITTED IN CROATIA, AND THE </p><p>U.S. WOULD CONTINUE TO CALL ATTENTION TO THEM, </p><p>ESPECIALLY SO LONG AS THERE WAS A CLEAR GAP BETWEEN </p><p>STATED POLICY AND EFFECTIVE ACTION. </p><p>9. (C) GRANIC CONCEDED THERE HAD BEEN A GAP BETWEEN </p><p>POLICY AND ACTION, BUT ARGUED IT WAS BEING CLOSED. </p><p>STEPS WERE BEING TAKEN ON THE PROPERTY ISSUE AND ON </p><p>RETURN OF REFUGEES, THERE WERE ONLY ABOUT 3,000 </p><p>REMAINING "REAL" APPLICANTS FOR RETURN WHOSE CASES </p><p>REMAINED UNRESOLVED; PROCEDURES WOULD BE EXPEDITED; IT </p><p>WAS SELF-EVIDENT THAT THOSE WHO WERE APPLYING TO COME </p><p>BACK TO CROATIA WERE NOT WAR CRIMINALS.  BUT EASTERN </p><p>SLAVONIA COULD NOT BE POSTPONED; DELAYS THERE WOULD </p><p>HAVE "INTERNAL REPERCUSSIONS" THAT WOULD ALSO BE FELT </p><p>ON THE BOSNIA PROCESS. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  05299  02 OF 02  291641Z </p><p>10. (C)  CHARGE SAID THAT NO ONE IN THE U.S. WAS </p><p>SUGGESTING POSTPONEMENT OF EASTERN SLAVONIA.  ON THE </p><p>CONTRARY, WE WERE PUSHING HARD TO GET THE PROCESS UNDER </p><p>WAY AND WERE WORKING TO HAVE ALL THE ELEMENTS IN PLACE </p><p>BY JANUARY 15.  HE NOTED THAT EASTERN SLAVONIA WOULD </p><p>OFFER THE GOC AN IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITY TO PROVE WITH </p><p>DEEDS THAT IT WANTED TO CLOSE THE GAP BETWEEN POLICY </p><p>AND TANGIBLE RESULTS.  THERE HAD BEEN MANY OFFICIAL </p><p>STATEMENTS ON THE RIGHT OF RETURN, BUT SO FAR ONLY A </p><p>HANDFUL HAD BEEN ALLOWED, AND NOT TO THE KRAJINA AREA. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>BETWEEN THE LINES, DIVERGENT VIEWS WITHIN THE GOC </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>11. (S) GRANIC EMPHASIZED MORE THAN ONCE HIS OWN </p><p>"PERSONAL" COMMITMENT TO BETTER GOC HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>PERFORMANCE.  (COMMENT: IT HAS LONG BEEN EVIDENT THAT </p><p>OTHERS IN THE GOVERNMENT, VIZ. SUSAK AND TUDJMAN, ARE </p><p>LESS PERSUADED OF THIS COURSE).  BISCEVIC, SEEING US </p><p>OUT, ALSO PLEADED FOR U.S. "UNDERSTANDING" OF THE </p><p>"PRACTICAL ASPECTS" OF HUMAN RIGHTS PRESSURES, WHEN </p><p>GRANIC HAD TO DEFEND HIS PRO-HUMAN RIGHTS STANCE WITHIN </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT.  CHARGE SAID THE U.S. UNDERSTOOD, BUT </p><p>CROATIA SHOULD ALSO WORK TO IMPROVE ITS HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>PERFORMANCE. </p><p> </p><p>12.
