END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>PROGRAM IN NAPLES </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  ON OCTOBER 22, CONSULATE NAPLES CO-SPONSORED WITH THE </p><p>ITALIAN FARMERS\' ASSOCIATION (CIA) A CONFERENCE IN NAPLES TO </p><p>DISCUSS POTENTIAL AGRICULTURAL BIOTECH APPLICATIONS IN THE </p><p>MEDITERRANEAN REGION.  APPROXIMATELY 100 ITALIANS FROM </p><p>THROUGHOUT ITALY ATTENDED THE CONFERENCE, INCLUDING FARMERS, </p><p>RESEARCHERS, UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS, ENVIRONMENTALISTS, </p><p>BUSINESSMEN INVOLVED IN THE FOOD PROCESSING INDUSTRY, AND </p><p>PRESS.  NAPLES CONSUL GENERAL BISHOP DELIVERED OPENING </p><p>REMARKS AT THE SESSION, WHICH WAS CHAIRED BY NAPLES </p><p>UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR OF AGRICULTURAL GENETICS DR. LUIGI </p><p>MONTI. </p><p> </p><p>3.  THE PROGRAM, DEVELOPED IN CONCERT WITH PA ROME, FAS ROME </p><p>AND THE ROME SCIENCE OFFICE, INCLUDED THREE U.S. SPEAKERS - </p><p>TWO SPONSORED BY PUBLIC AFFAIRS, AND THE THIRD BY FAS ROME. </p><p>DR. RAY BRESSAN (PROFESSOR OF PLANT PHYSIOLOGY AT PURDUE </p><p>UNIVERSITY) PLACED THE BIOTECHNOLOGY DEBATE IN ITS </p><p>HISTORICAL CONTEXT, EMPHASIZING BIOTECH AS A NATURAL </p><p>CONTINUATION IN THE PROCESS OF AGRICULTURAL INNOVATION THAT </p><p>HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR MILLENNIA.  BRESSAN STRESSED THAT </p><p>GIVEN THE EXPONENTIAL GROWTH OF THE HUMAN POPULATION OVER </p><p>THE PAST 150 YEARS, TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION IS THE ONLY WAY </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  05973  01 OF 03  131147Z </p><p>TO ENSURE A SUFFICIENT FOOD SUPPLY WITHOUT INCREASING STRESS </p><p>ON AN OVERBURDENED ENVIRONMENT.  PROF. MAARTEN CHRISPEELS </p><p>(PROFESSOR OF MOLECULAR AGRICULTURE, UNIVERSITY OF </p><p>CALIFORNIA AT SAN DIEGO) FOCUSED ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF </p><p>GENOMICS AND ONGOING RESEARCH EFFORTS TO ENHANCE THE </p><p>RESISTANCE OF PLANTS USED IN AGRICULTURE.  JANET CARPENTER, </p><p>A RESEARCHER AT THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR FOOD AND AGRICULTURE </p><p>POLICY, SUMMARIZED A NUMBER OF RECENT STUDIES ON THE IMPACT </p><p>OF GENETICALLY MODIFIED CROPS IN THE UNITED STATES.  THE </p><p>EVIDENCE OF A DRAMATIC DECLINE IN PESTICIDE USE AND LOWER </p><p>PRODUCTION COSTS FOR FARMERS, FOLLOWING THE INTRODUCTION OF </p><p>BIOTECH CROPS, WAS PARTICULARLY INTERESTING TO THE AUDIENCE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  ON THE ITALIAN SIDE, PROF. FABIO VERONESI FROM THE </p><p>UNIVERSITY OF PERUGIA ARGUED THAT BIOTECHNOLOGY COULD PLAY A </p><p>CRUCIAL ROLE IN "DEFENDING" THE AUTHENTICITY OF "TYPICAL" </p><p>PRODUCTS FROM ITALY\'S VARIOUS REGIONS.  GENETIC TESTING, </p><p>ACCORDING TO VERONESI, MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO DETECT "FAKES" - </p><p>IMPORTED PRODUCTS THAT ARE BEING PASSED OFF AS THE "REAL </p><p>THING."  VERONESI\'S ARGUMENT HAS GREAT RESONANCE IN ITALY, </p><p>WHERE IT IS OFTEN ARGUED THAT BIOTECHNOLOGY THREATENS TO </p><p>UNDERMINE THE HIGH-END NICHE MARKET FOR TYPICAL ITALIAN </p><p>PRODUCTS.  DR. ALBINO MAGGIO, A BIOTECH RESEARCHER AT THE </p><p>NATIONAL AGENCY FOR NEW TECHNOLOGIES, ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENT </p><p>(ENEA), DISCUSSED HIS RESEARCH IN GENETIC MANIPULATION THAT </p><p>MAKES CROPS MORE RESISTANT TO HIGH-SALINITY ENVIRONMENTS. </p><p>THE ISSUE IS ESPECIALLY RELEVANT IN SOUTHERN ITALY, WHERE </p><p>SOIL SALINIZATION IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM IN KEY AGRICULTURAL </p><p>REGIONS SUCH AS PUGLIA AND SICILY.

IN A THOROUGH OVERVIEW OF THE STATE OF </p><p>BIOTECHNOLOGY IN THE EU, DE CASTRO CALLED FOR DRAMATIC </p><p>BUDGET INCREASES FOR RESEARCH.  HOWEVER, HE POINTED OUT THAT </p><p>RESEARCH IN BIOTECH NOW </p><p> WOULD IN NO WAY PRECLUDE FUTURE </p><p>DECISIONS TO LIMIT THE MARKETING OF GENETICALLY MODIFIED </p><p>FOODS IN EUROPE. </p><p>5.  THE AUDIENCE WAS GENERALLY OPEN-MINDED ABOUT THE </p><p>POTENTIAL OF BIOTECHNOLOGY IN THE ITALIAN CONTEXT.  THE </p><p>PROGRAM CONCLUDED WITH A LIVELY DISCUSSION, DURING WHICH </p><p>VIRTUALLY ALL PARTICIPANTS - INCLUDING THE NAPLES PRESIDENT </p><p>OF LEGAMBIENTE, ITALY\'S LARGEST ENVIRONMENTAL NGO - AGREED </p><p>THAT THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT SHOULD PUSH AHEAD WITH INCREASED </p><p>RESEARCH IN THE BIOTECH FIELD.  DR. MASSIMO PACETTI, </p><p>NATIONAL PRESIDENT OF THE FARMERS\' ASSOCIATION, CLOSED THE </p><p>MEETING BY CITING THE POTENTIAL OF BIOTECHNOLOGY TO INCREASE </p><p>ITALY\'S AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION, INCREASE FARMERS\' INCOMES, </p><p>AND REDUCE HARM TO THE ENVIRONMENT. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  05973  02 OF 03  131147Z </p><p>6.  THE PROGRAM WAS COVERED EXTENSIVELY BY LOCAL/REGIONAL </p><p>MEDIA INCLUDING "RAI 3," "TELECAPRI," "NATIONAL NETWORK 5 </p><p>STELLE," "CANALE 21," "IL MATTINO," "ANSA," "IL DENARO," "IL </p><p>GIORNALE DI NAPOLI,"AND RADIO CLUB \'91."  THE LEADING </p><p>NATIONAL ECONOMIC DAILY "IL SOLE 24 ORE," "LA STAMPA," AND </p><p>THE NATIONAL NETWORK "RAI 1" ALSO PROVIDED STRAIGHT FORWARD </p><p>COVERAGE. </p><p> </p><p>7.  THE NAPLES PROGRAM MOVED OUR AGENDA FORWARD BY EXPANDING </p><p>THE SCOPE OF SCIENCE-BASED BIOTECH DEBATE IN SOUTHERN ITALY, </p><p>AN AREA IN WHICH KNOWLEDGE OF U.S. BIOTECH RESEARCH AND </p><p>FIELD RESULTS ARE RELATIVELY THIN. CONSULATE NAPLES EXPANDED </p><p>ITS RANGE OF BIOTECHNOLOGY CONTACTS IN THE SOUTH, THUS </p><p>LAYING THE GROUNDWORK FOR FURTHER "AUDIENCE-BUILDING" IN </p><p>FUTURE PROGRAMS. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>PROGRAM IN ROME </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  BEFORE GOING TO NAPLES, BRESSAN AND CHRISPEELS MET WITH </p><p>FAO OFFICIALS, PROF. JOSE ESQUINAS-ALCAZAR, SECRETARY OF THE </p><p>COMMISSION ON GENETIC RESOURCES FOR FOOD AND AGRICULTURE, </p><p>AND ANDREA SONNINO, SENIOR AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH OFFICER. </p><p>CHRISPEELS MADE A PRESENTATION ABOUT HIS NEW BOOK "PLANTS, </p><p>GENES AND CROP BIOTECHNOLOGY" AND ASKED FOR FAO HELP ON </p><p>DISTRIBUTING IT TO DEVELOPING COUNTRIES UNIVERSITY TEACHERS. </p><p> </p><p>9.  ON OCT. 23 EMBASSY ROME ORGANIZED AN OPEN DISCUSSION </p><p>MEETING WITH THE MOST IMPORTANT ITALIAN CONSUMERS </p><p>ASSOCIATIONS, TRADE UNION REPRESENTATIVES, AND ENVIRONMENTAL </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  05973  02 OF 03  131147Z </p><p>NGO\'S (GREENPEACE AND WWF).  THE THREE SCIENTISTS MADE SHORT </p><p>PRESENTATIONS AND A LONG Q AND A SESSION FOLLOWED. IN ROME </p><p>THE SPEAKERS MANAGED TO CORRECT FALSE IMPRESSIONS ABOUT </p><p>BIOTECHNOLOGY HELD BY MANY CONSUMERS IN ITALY. ONE SIMPLE </p><p>BUT IMPORTANT POINT THEY MADE WAS THAT BIOTECH PRODUCTS ARE </p><p>CONTROLLED BY PUBLIC AUTHORITIES IN THE U.S. (I.E. THE FDA) </p><p>AND THOROUGHLY TESTED BEFORE BEING APPROVED FOR THE MARKET. </p><p>THIS CAME AS A SURPRISE TO SOME PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS, WHO </p><p>WERE CONVINCED THAT DECISIONS ABOUT COMMERCIALIZATION WERE </p><p>BASED SOLELY ON RESEARCH CONDUCTED BY THE PRODUCERS </p><p>THEMSELVES.  POST BELIEVES THAT THE EVENT WAS A SUCCESS:  IT </p><p>WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT POST ORGANIZED AN EVENT INVITING </p><p>STRONG ANTI-GMO REPRESENTATIVES AND ALL THE INVITED PEOPLE </p><p>CAME (A VERY RARE EVENT).  MOREOVER, EVEN IF SCIENTISTS AND </p><p>AUDIENCE DID NOT CHANGE THEIR POSITIONS, THE DEBATE WAS </p><p>LIVELY AND FRANK AND LASTED FOR TWO HOURS LONGER THAN </p><p>PROGRAMMED. </p><p> </p><p>10.  WHILE IN ROME, EMBASSY VATICAN CHARGE ORGANIZED A </p><p>LUNCHEON FOR THE THREE EXPERTS, WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF THE </p><p>VATICAN FOREIGN MINISTRY, THE PONTIFICAL ACADEMIES AND THE </p><p>SANT\'EGIDIO COMMUNITY - A VATICAN-RELATED NGO THAT WORKS IN </p><p>CONFLICT PREVENTION AND DEVELOPMENT, PRIMARILY IN AFRICA. </p><p>CHRISPEEL\'S PRESENTATION OF BIOTECH FOOD SAFETY AND THE </p><p>APPROPRIATENESS OF USING BIOTECH AS A KEY TOOL IN DEVELOPING </p><p>COUNTRY FOOD SECURITY HELPED REINFORCE THE INCLINATIONS OF </p><p>THE BIO-ETHICISTS FROM THE PONTIFICAL ACADEMIES.
