<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ROME 004963 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/10/2012 </p><p>TAGS: KAWC, KJUS, PREL, PGOV, HR, IT, UN, EUN </p><p>SUBJECT: CROATIA/ICTY: GOI SUPPORTS STRONG PRIVATE, NUANCED </p><p>PUBLIC, POSITION ON BOBETKO INDICTMENT </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 188407 </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  04963  120519Z </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: POL MC TOM COUNTRYMAN.  REASON:1.5 (B)(D) </p><p> </p><p> 1.  (C)  DRAWING ON POINTS REFTEL, POL MC ON OCTOBER 4 </p><p>UNDERLINED TO DIRECTOR OF MFA BALKANS OFFICE MAURIZIO MASSARI </p><p>USG\'S VIEW THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF CROATIA SHOULD COMPLY </p><p>IMMEDIATELY AND IN FULL WITH THE INDICTMENT BY THE ICTY OF </p><p>GENERAL BOBETKO.  HE UNDERSCORED THE SERIOUS RAMIFICATIONS OF </p><p>NON-COMPLIANCE, INCLUDING THE PRECEDENT THIS ACTION COULD SET </p><p>FOR RESPONSES TO FUTURE INDICTMENTS AND IC SUPPORT FOR </p><p>CROATIA\'S EU AND NATO ASPIRATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  MASSARI SAID THE GOI HAD THE SAME VIEW AS THE USG ON </p><p>THE IMPORTANCE OF THE GOC\'S COMPLETE COOPERATION WITH THE </p><p>ICTY ON THIS AND ALL INDICTMENTS.  HE HAD INSTRUCTED THE </p><p>ITALIAN EMBASSY IN ZAGREB ON OCTOBER 3 TO DELIVER A STRONG </p><p>MESSAGE TO THE GOC, URGING THAT IT SURRENDER BOBETKO </p><p>IMMEDIATELY.  ON SEPTEMBER 30, CROATIAN PARLIAMENT SPEAKER </p><p>ZLATKO TOMCIC HAD MET IN ROME WITH PRESIDENT OF THE CHAMBER </p><p>OF DEPUTIES PIER FERDINANDO CASINI.  MASSARI SAID THAT WHEN </p><p>CASINI MADE SIMILAR TOUGH POINTS, TOMCIC RESPONDED THAT THE </p><p>GOC WOULD NEED "SEVERAL WEEKS" JUST TO EXAMINE THE ICTY </p><p>INDICTMENT, FOLLOWED BY AN INDETERMINATE PERIOD TO RESPOND. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  MASSARI SAID THAT WHILE THE GOI FAVORS A TOUGH LINE </p><p>WITH THE GOI, IT THOUGHT THAT A MORE "NUANCED" APPROACH WAS </p><p>NEEDED FOR PUBLIC DISCOURSE ON THE CASE.  USE OF PHRASES SUCH </p><p>AS "UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER" WERE COUNTERPRODUCTIVE, AND </p><p>COULD CAUSE A BACKLASH WITH THE GENERAL PUBLIC, POSSIBLY </p><p>RALLYING SUPPORT FOR HARDLINE HDZ VIEWS.  THE PUBLIC LINE </p><p>SHOULD FOCUS ON THE POSITIVE ASPECTS OF COOPERATION, SUCH AS </p><p>THE BENEFITS TO THE GENERAL POPULATION OF CLOSER TIES TO THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  04963  120519Z </p><p>EU.   MASSARI SAID THAT THE IC MUST CALIBRATE CAREFULLY ITS </p><p>PUBLIC AND PRIVATE APPROACHES.  HE ALSO SUGGESTED THAT JOINT </p><p>U.S./EU APPROACHES TO THE GOC, POSSIBLY AN EU TROIKA/USG </p><p>DEMARCHE, COULD BE AN EFFECTIVE METHOD OF SWAYING GOC VIEWS. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME04963 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
