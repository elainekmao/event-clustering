O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EINV, ETRD, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: GOZ Announces Export Support Mechanism </p><p> </p><p>Ref: Harare 343 </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary:  As previewed in reftel, the GOZ has </p><p>announced a long-awaited support mechanism for exporters, </p><p>which amounts to a targeted devaluation on export </p><p>revenue.  This is welcome news for exporters, but it is </p><p>unclear if forex-starved importers will be able to access </p><p>U.S. dollars at the new 800:1 rate.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. Under the previous mechanism, exporters were required </p><p>to exchange 50 percent of revenue at the official rate of </p><p>55:1 and had to petition the Reserve Bank for access to </p><p>the other 50 percent in hard currency.  (The market rate </p><p>is currently around 1400:1.)  In many cases, the GOZ </p><p>withheld over 95 percent of revenue.  Now exporters will </p><p>exchange the first 50 percent at 800:1, receiving about </p><p>15-times as many Zimdollars.  They will still have to </p><p>petition for the second 50 percent within a 60-day </p><p>period.  If the Reserve Bank grants them access to the </p><p>second 50 percent, they will earn an effective blend rate </p><p>of around 1100:1. </p><p> </p><p>3. After the GOZ announced its 2003 budget in November, </p><p>most exporters halted production or exchanged forex </p><p>earnings exclusively on the black market.  The new policy </p><p>may induce some of them to restart operations and return </p><p>to legality.  The Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries </p><p>and a host of other organizations have lobbied the GOZ </p><p>for export relief.  The new 800:1 rate replaces all </p><p>previous rates, in particular those for tobacco and gold </p><p>exports. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>4. In yesterday\'s announcement, the GOZ took a small step </p><p>toward acknowledging macroeconomic reality and moving </p><p>beyond its unsupported and preposterous official exchange </p><p>rate of 55:1.  However, unresolved issues remain.  Most </p><p>importantly, the GOZ has not disclosed whether it will </p><p>sell U.S. dollars to importers at 800:1.  Given the </p><p>present array of price controls, many are unable to </p><p>import goods at market cost.  Furthermore, exporters will </p><p>want to see whether the GOZ withholds their second 50 </p><p>percent of export revenue (deposited in the Reserve Bank </p><p>foreign currency accounts), which could effectively </p><p>deflate the blend rate from 1100 to 400:1.  Post will </p><p>continue to track the impact of the devaluation and other </p><p>measures noted in reftel. </p><p> </p><p>Sullivan </p><p></p></div>
