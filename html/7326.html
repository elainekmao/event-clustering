<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 002204 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/08/2013 </p><p>TAGS: AEMR, AMGT, PREL, ASEC, CASC, CVIS, EFIN, ETRD, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZO1: AMMAN SITREP 33 (4/10 1845 LOCAL) </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) FBIS GMP20030409000226 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM Gregory L. Berry for reasons 1.5 (B)(D). </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>General Overview </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Most Jordanians are still sorting through the complex </p><p>emotions unleashed by the events of the past 24 hours in </p><p>Baghdad and elsewhere in Iraq.  Many appear in a state of </p><p>shock that Saddam\'s rule collapsed so quickly, depressed that </p><p>"once again the Arabs have lost," and uncomfortable with the </p><p>sight of American troops occupying a historic Arab capital. </p><p>Generally, however, they are relieved -- relieved that their </p><p>worst nightmares about the war\'s impact on Jordan failed to </p><p>occur and relieved that the human suffering of Iraqis appears </p><p>close to an end.  Most continue to remain deeply skeptical of </p><p>U.S. motives and fear that Israel will use these events to </p><p>its advantage against the Palestinians.  It is clear that </p><p>many are struggling to reconcile their disappointment and </p><p>shock with the undeniable scenes of joy in Baghdad. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>Consular Issues </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) See para 11 below. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>GOJ Actions/Statements </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) In an April 9 letter addressed to PM Ali Abul Ragheb, </p><p>King Abdullah directed the GOJ to "take all necessary </p><p>measures to launch a national campaign to extend humanitarian </p><p>aid and secure essential medical and food supplies to the </p><p>Iraqi people." (Jordan Times April 10) </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Minister of Information Mohammad al-Adwan stated April </p><p>9 that Jordan would not "interfere in the issue of </p><p>determining the future government of Iraq.  The future and </p><p>destiny of Iraq should be in the hands of its people.  Jordan </p><p>will under no circumstances accept division of Iraq." (Jordan </p><p>Times, April 10) </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) Foreign Minister Marwan Muasher, Minister of Energy </p><p>and Mineral Resources Mohammed Batayneh, and Minister of </p><p>Information Adwan April 9 all categorically denied rumors </p><p>that Jordanian and Israeli officials will meet to discuss the </p><p>possibility of restarting an old oil pipeline linking Iraq to </p><p>the Israeli port of Haifa through Jordan.  Adwan stated that </p><p>"no contacts have been made with anyone regarding such an </p><p>issue."  Batayneh characterized the rumors as "groundless and </p><p>totally untrue." (Jordan Times April 10).  FM Muasher echoed </p><p>these statements in an April 9 interview on Al-Jazeera and </p><p>added that "any improvement in relations with Israel is </p><p>contingent on how the Israeli government is responsive with </p><p>the Middle East peace efforts." (ref A) </p><p>-------- </p><p>Security </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) The investigation into the April 8 shooting incident </p><p>involving an Embassy TDYer continues (septel). This evening </p><p>two public gatherings in Amman are planned in response to the </p><p>Jordanian journalist killed in Iraq.  As of 1500 local, the </p><p>PSD has not yet confirmed whether any demonstrations or </p><p>gatherings are expected for this weekend. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>Economic and Trade Developments </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) No new issues. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>Refugee/Humanitarian Issues </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (S) The Jordan-Iraq border remains open.  CENTCOM sources </p><p>report that Iraqi officials have abandoned their border </p><p>posting, leaving the Iraqi side of the Karameh border </p><p>crossing unstaffed and vacant.  One report said the Iraqi </p><p>border officials reportedly joined the 100-plus car convoy of </p><p>journalists headed east on Hwy 10; but in fact that convoy </p><p>decided to remain near the border overnight.   CENTCOM </p><p>elements indicate that U.S. forces are moving to control the </p><p>now abandoned Iraqi border checkpoints with Jordan (Karameh) </p><p>and Syria (near the Syrian town of at-Tanf). </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) IOM reports that 11 TCNs crossed the border into </p><p>Jordan on April 9.  No TCNs or Iraqi refugees have crossed </p><p>into Jordan today.  IOM is repatriating 38 Moroccans, 14 </p><p>Somalis and 3 Iraqis with Egyptian travel documents later </p><p>today.  The total TCN transit camp population hovers around </p><p>200, comprised of Somali and Sudanese nationals who do not </p><p>want to be repatriated, 24 undocumented Palestinians and six </p><p>Iraqi refugees.  The Jordan Red Crescent agreed to house the </p><p>Iraqi refugees indefinitely, as it would not be </p><p>cost-effective for UNHCR to open its camp for only six </p><p>refugees.  IOM is in the process of scaling down its TCN </p><p>transit operations and will leave only 1 international and 8 </p><p>locally hired employees in Ruwaished. </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) UNHCR and IOM hope to convince the Government of </p><p>Jordan to allow the 24 Palestinians to join relatives in </p><p>Amman, provided those relatives provide letters of guarantee. </p><p> They are meeting with the GOJ later this afternoon to </p><p>discuss the issue. </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>Press </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU) A large convoy of journalists, including Amcits, is </p><p>crossing into Iraq from Jordan today.  The convoy, estimated </p><p>at between 75 and 120 vehicles, was at the border at </p><p>approximately 1330 local. It was expected to break up into </p><p>multiple convoys once having crossed into Iraq.  Embassy </p><p>Amman and CENTCOM Public Affairs liaison have continued to </p><p>urge strongly against travel into what remains an active </p><p>battle area.  We have told all who will listen that there can </p><p>be no guarantee of security offered by Coalition military </p><p>forces.  The Government of Jordan has come under intense </p><p>pressure from the journalists to allow passage, and we </p><p>understand they are processing the group slowly through the </p><p>border.  We have informed CENTCOM of the issue.  We do not </p><p>have a complete list of who is in this group of journalists. </p><p>According to CBS, Dan Rather is among them.  Rather is </p><p>determined, apparently, to reach Baghdad tonight.  Others </p><p>simply want to get inside Iraq so that they can file </p><p>datelines from inside Iraqi territory.  The Consular Section </p><p>is prepared to assist any Amcit journalists who may encounter </p><p>problems and return to Jordan.  We will continue to follow </p><p>this situation closely and will provide updates to the CMS </p><p>Task Force via e-mail as they become available. </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
