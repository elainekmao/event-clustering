USAID\'S CURRENT PROGRAM TOTALS APPROXIMATELY $2 </p><p>MILLION PER YEAR FOR A VARIETY OF ACTIVITIES WITH A NUMBER OF </p><p>NGO PARTNERS.  USAID IS FUNDING FAMILY HEALTH INTERNATIONAL </p><p>(FHI) TO PROVIDE COMPREHENSIVE HIV/AIDS PREVENTION PROGRAMS </p><p>IN FOUR PROVINCES INCLUDING DROP-IN CENTERS FOR INJECTION </p><p>DRUG USERS (IDUS) AND COMMERCIAL SEX WORKERS AND EXTENSIVE </p><p>BEHAVIOR CHANGE COMMUNICATION CAMPAIGNS.

ACCORDING TO A RECENT GOVERNMENT PRESS RELEASE, VIETNAM </p><p>HAS DETECTED 39,845 HIV INFECTED PEOPLE AS OF OCTOBER 1. </p><p>HOWEVER, IT IS ESTIMATED THAT 107,000 PEOPLE ARE LIVING WITH </p><p>HIV/AIDS.  AMONG THEM, 5,955 HAVE DEVELOPED FULL-BLOWN AIDS </p><p>AND 3,247 DIED.  THE LARGEST NUMBERS OF HIV-INFECTED PERSONS </p><p>AND AIDS PATIENTS ARE FOUND IN QUANG NINH PROVINCE, AND THE </p><p>CITIES OF HAIPHONG, HANOI, AND HO CHI MINH CITY.  ALL 61 </p><p>PROVINCES HAVE REPORTED HIV/AIDS CASES. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  VIETNAM HAS EXPERIENCED A MARKED INCREASE IN HIV </p><p>INFECTION.  DRUG INJECTION, LONG A PROBLEM IN VIETNAM, HAS </p><p>CONTRIBUTED TO THE EXPLOSIVE EPIDEMIC GROWTH.  HIV INFECTION </p><p>AMONG IDUS NOW EXCEEDS 50% IN HO CHI MINH CITY AND HAIPHONG. </p><p>THERE ARE ALARMING LINKAGES BETWEEN DRUG USERS AND OTHER </p><p>POPULATIONS, PARTICULARLY SEX WORKERS.  NEARLY A QUARTER OF </p><p>IDUS IN HANOI AND OVER A FIFTH IN DA NANG SAID THAT THEY HAD </p><p>BOUGHT SEX IN THE PAST YEAR, AND MOST DID NOT USE CONDOMS. </p><p>THIS CLEARLY REPRESENTS A WORRYING POTENTIAL FOR THE WIDER </p><p>SPREAD OF HIV TO SEX WORKERS AND THEIR CLIENTS. </p><p> </p><p>7.  THERE ARE POSITIVE SIGNS THAT THE VIETNAMESE DELEGATION\'S </p><p>ATTENDANCE AT THE ICAAP IN MELBOURNE HAS HELPED STRENGTHEN </p><p>THE HAND OF THOSE IN THE GVN WHO ARGUE THAT HARM REDUCTION </p><p>EFFORTS (SUCH AS NEEDLE EXCHANGE PROGRAMS) AND OTHER PUBLIC </p><p>HEALTH APPROACHES ARE MORE EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING HIV/AIDS </p><p>THAN THE CURRENT OFFICIAL GVN MENTALITY, WHICH TREATS </p><p>HIV/AIDS AS A "SOCIAL EVIL" AND HAS HAMPERED THE FIGHT </p><p>AGAINST THE DISEASE. </p><p>PORTER </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
