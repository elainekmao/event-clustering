<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 HARARE 000468 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF/S </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JFRAZER </p><p> </p><p>E. O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAGR, ETRD, ECON, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: Heinz subsidiary barely weathering the storm </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED -- NOT FOR INTERNET POSTING </p><p> </p><p>(SBU)  Summary:  A recent visit to an American company in </p><p>Zimbabwe shows that no strategy is too insignificant for a </p><p>local branch of a multinational to consider in its efforts </p><p>to stay afloat in the current economy.  Despite crippling </p><p>price controls, soaring input costs, and severe labor force </p><p>pressures, Olivine -- which is locally based and has no </p><p>ability to relocate outside of Zimbabwe -- is limping along. </p><p>Survival strategies include the usual:  decreasing </p><p>production, or rebranding, reformulating, and resizing its </p><p>products to avoid government-mandated prices that recover </p><p>barely a quarter of production costs.  Olivine has even </p><p>inquired whether it can refine relief oil provided by food </p><p>donors in order to earn some reasonable income.  Recognizing </p><p>the surreal environment in which they operate, Olivine\'s </p><p>managers are attempting to keep their business afloat -- for </p><p>their employees as well as for their bottom line -- until </p><p>some long-hoped-for economic solution appears. End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU)  Laboff and Econ chief visited Olivine, a former </p><p>Zimbabwean company now jointly owned by American </p><p>multinational Heinz and the GOZ, in order to assess the </p><p>impact of the current economy on an "American" company. </p><p>Olivine was sold by its local founders to Heinz, which </p><p>purchased the company in a cooperative venture with the GOZ, </p><p>in the early 1980s.  The deal actually took several years to </p><p>complete, since the GOZ originally demanded 51% ownership. </p><p>Heinz, which refused to buy in unless it retained majority </p><p>status and control of management, finally prevailed and </p><p>Heinz formally purchased the company in 1984.  Olivine\'s </p><p>primary businesses include processing oilseeds and producing </p><p>edible and industrial oils, manufacturing soaps, </p><p>manufacturing margarine, bakers\' fats and other vegetable </p><p>spreads, and preparing and packaging Heinz branded products </p><p>such as catsup, condiments and canned goods. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>Operational Constraints </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU)  The current economic climate has been devastating </p><p>to Olivine.  Many of its products -- cooking oil, soap, </p><p>margarine, bakers\' fats and some canned goods -- are </p><p>considered "essential," and have been subjected to price </p><p>controls.  In some cases, the government-mandated prices are </p><p>barely one-quarter of the cost of production.  Additionally, </p><p>since the majority of Olivine\'s products are intended for </p><p>the domestic market, the company cannot benefit from export- </p><p>directed economic strategies, such as the ability to retain </p><p>forex.  Olivine is also subject to increased constraints due </p><p>to its American-based legal obligations; in a post-Enron </p><p>environment, Olivine is precluded from taking advantage of </p><p>some less-than-forthright tactics which are supporting its </p><p>Zimbabwean competitors (with the sole exception of </p><p>purchasing necessary forex on the parallel market, see </p><p>below). </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU)  Labor concerns remain a constant headache for </p><p>Olivine\'s management.  The brain-drain has had a massive </p><p>negative impact on Olivine\'s skilled workforce:  Olivine has </p><p>lost 11 of 31 journeyman-level craftsmen to emigration </p><p>within the last year.  HIV/Aids has also taken its toll; the </p><p>manager of the cotton seed processing unit died the day </p><p>before our visit after a three-year battle with Aids, and </p><p>attendance of his co-workers at his funeral actually closed </p><p>the processing unit for the day.  Finally, the hyper- </p><p>inflationary pressures on Olivine\'s 2000-plus workforce have </p><p>erupted into several major labor confrontations, culminating </p><p>in an episode in which Olivine managers were besieged and </p><p>held hostage in their offices by an angry mob of workers </p><p>demanding higher wages.  Currently, management is conducting </p><p>a last-ditch negotiating marathon with the Works Council in </p><p>an attempt to formalize a wage increase by the end of </p><p>February and ahead of a GOZ-imposed six-month wage freeze. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU)  Additionally, as an agro-industrial company </p><p>dependent upon agricultural produce, Olivine has been </p><p>particularly hard hit by the reduction of Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>agricultural productivity as it is forced to search farther </p><p>afield for its inputs.  Olivine has traditionally processed </p><p>about 75% of the soybeans produced by Zimbabwe farmers. </p><p>While an average year would see an annual yield of 120 to </p><p>130 thousand kgs of soybeans, forecasts for this year are </p><p>indicating a total crop of less than 60 thousand kgs. </p><p>Olivine must necessarily make up the difference by </p><p>purchasing imported inputs -- at real-world prices -- if it </p><p>intends to even approach current production rates. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>Coping Mechanisms While Waiting for a Change </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU)  As with most other manufacturers, Olivine is </p><p>simply trying to maintain its positions while hoping for a </p><p>political change which will bring economic relief.  Despite </p><p>the legal and ethical implications which constrict American- </p><p>related businesses, Olivine has been reduced to sourcing its </p><p>forex on the parallel market -- an illegal necessity which </p><p>has had direct impact on its bottom line.  Its most recent </p><p>purchase of parallel-market forex was in November, at a </p><p>1600:1 rate.  That translated directly into price increases </p><p>in mid-November, at about the time the new budget was </p><p>announced.  When the GOZ noticed the "unapproved" price </p><p>increases, it quickly slapped price controls on many of </p><p>Olivine\'s products -- and back-dated the price controls to </p><p>the beginning of November. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) Olivine has reduced its production to a bare </p><p>minimum in efforts to keep its plant operational without </p><p>being so unprofitable that it must close down.  It has laid </p><p>off its seasonal complement of 300-400 contract workers, and </p><p>management sees no possibility of re-hiring them for the </p><p>next production period.  The soybean oil refining plant is </p><p>running at 30% of capacity.  Where it used to produce ten </p><p>types of soap, Olivine now produces three.  Ironically, </p><p>because of the skewed exchange rate, Olivine\'s "official" </p><p>profits (at the fictitious 55:1 official rate) would make it </p><p>appear to be one of the best-performing Heinz facilities </p><p>worldwide.  Olivine\'s managers have consequently refused to </p><p>calculate its profits at the official rate, and Olivine </p><p>therefore shows no profit at all in Heinz\'s international </p><p>figures. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU)  Olivine has also resorted to many of the coping </p><p>mechanisms of other Zimbabwean manufacturers: rebranding, </p><p>reformulating, and repackaging.  Although its economy-line </p><p>soap is price controlled at an unrealistically low retail </p><p>level, Olivine has simply changed the color of the soap from </p><p>blue to brown, and increased the price of its "new" product </p><p>to a sustainable level.  Similarly, it has changed the </p><p>moisture content of its margarine in order to produce a new </p><p>"spread" which is not price-controlled and allows them to </p><p>keep operating.  Although the 750 ml size bottle of cooking </p><p>oil is price-controlled, the 50-liter drum of "industrial" </p><p>oil is not controlled -- despite the fact that it is exactly </p><p>the same product.  To be sure, the GOZ is aware of some of </p><p>these coping mechanisms, and Olivine has been warned not to </p><p>divert too much product to the "industrial" packaging, under </p><p>the threat of having that, too, slapped with price controls. </p><p>Olivine has cut production to a mere trickle, which is not </p><p>sustainable but which allows them to at least stay in </p><p>business, in hopes of economic changes.  However, faced with </p><p>the prospect of shutting down completely -- and putting two </p><p>thousand employees, some of them 30-year veterans, out on </p><p>the street -- Olivine simply plows ahead, making management </p><p>decisions on a daily, ad hoc basis. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>Positioning for the Hoped-For Recovery </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU)  However, Olivine -- like most other Zimbabwean </p><p>businesses -- tries to prepare for a better economic </p><p>environment in a post-Mugabe economy.  For instance, cotton </p><p>is one of the few crops actually predicted to do well in the </p><p>short term.  In an attempt to facilitate its handling of an </p><p>increased cotton crop, Olivine has made plans to increase </p><p>capacity in its cottonseed production unit should the </p><p>promise be fulfilled.  Olivine is also trying to maintain </p><p>its permanent workforce so that it can ramp up production </p><p>with a minimum of delay should the situation improve.  At </p><p>significant cost, Olivine continues to subsidize a canteen </p><p>for its lowest-grade employees, and often provides the only </p><p>meal many of its employees get each day.  Olivine has also </p><p>approached the Embassy with the request to refine any relief </p><p>oil provided by international donors, and hopes thereby to </p><p>utilize some of its excess capacity and earn some badly- </p><p>needed revenue. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU)  Olivine is admittedly only one of the </p><p>manufacturers struggling in Zimbabwe today.  However, its </p><p>status as an American business offers both provocation and </p><p>protection.  The only canned goods in Zimbabwe subject to </p><p>price controls are Heinz brands; Olivine\'s CEO, while he is </p><p>aware of this anomaly, has not ascribed it too much meaning </p><p>-- yet.  Due to its position as the largest refiner of </p><p>edible oils in Zimbabwe, Olivine is an attractive target to </p><p>certain elements in the GOZ, which believe that if an </p><p>"essential" business cannot compete under price controls, it </p><p>should be given to somebody who can make it.  Although the </p><p>GOZ would reportedly like to "indigenize" Olivine, </p><p>contractual obligations require that its 49% stake be </p><p>offered to Heinz on a first-refusal, sweetheart-deal basis. </p><p>Only if Heinz refuses to buy, can the GOZ offer its shares </p><p>to an indigenous businessman -- and then at a higher price </p><p>than that offered to Heinz. </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU) The alternative, of course, is for the GOZ to </p><p>nationalize the entire business.  Olivine\'s CEO is keenly </p><p>aware of that possibility, which is another reason he </p><p>attempts to carefully balance his operation in order to </p><p>simultaneously avoid bankruptcy and avoid being declared an </p><p>"economic saboteur."  Such a declaration, of course, would </p><p>open the door (under the current political reality) for a </p><p>takeover which would destroy the company -- and which could </p><p>not effectively be resisted by management, American business </p><p>or not. </p><p></p></div>
