<p>UNCLAS KATHMANDU 000390 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PINR, NP, Political Parties </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL\'S MAIN OPPOSITION PARTIES MERGE, BUT REMAIN </p><p>IN THE MINORITY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Putting the U Back in UML </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Nepal\'s main opposition party, the Communist Party </p><p>of Nepal - United Marxist and Leninist (UML), merged </p><p>February 15 with a smaller former offshoot, the Communist </p><p>Party of Nepal - Marxist-Leninist (ML).  (Note: The </p><p>combined parties will continue to use the UML name. </p><p>Although communist by name, these parties more closely </p><p>resemble European social-democratic parties.  UML leaders </p><p>claim to be even more democratic that the ruling Nepali </p><p>Congress, which in the UML view remains feudal, nepotistic </p><p>and corrupt.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>The Minority\'s Minority No More </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) In 1998, friction between leading figures in the </p><p>UML came to a head when UML parliamentarians opposed to </p><p>the Mahakali Treaty with India broke ranks and formed the </p><p>ML.  Although the ML garnered six percent of the votes in </p><p>the 1999 general election - making it the third largest </p><p>party in terms of the popular vote - it was unable to win </p><p>any seats in Parliament.  Efforts at reunification began a </p><p>year later, when the ML leadership saw that, as a former </p><p>minority in a minority party, they had made no inroads </p><p>with a platform only slightly to the left of the well- </p><p>established UML.  The head of the UML\'s foreign department </p><p>expressed hopes that the reunified UML could win a </p><p>majority in the next national elections, slated for 2004. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) The history of the Communist Party of Nepal (CPN) </p><p>has, since its founding in 1949, been a story of schisms, </p><p>factions, and (occasional) reunifications.  Two of the </p><p>main Maoist leaders, Prachanda and Baburam Bhattarai, both </p><p>founded their own schismatic CPN franchises in 1994, and </p><p>two years later merged them into the Maoist movement </p><p>currently menacing the nation.  (Note:  According to UML </p><p>leader Madhav Nepal, since the Maoists\' insurgency began </p><p>at least 45 CPN-UML cadres have died at the hands of the </p><p>Maoists.)  While the UML reunification was formalized </p><p>February 15, many assignments in the new party leadership </p><p>have yet to be made.  The centripetal trend behind the UML- </p><p>ML merger stems in part from increasing frustration over </p><p>Nepal\'s security and economic problems, but also because </p><p>many ambitious CPN leaders dislike being left out in the </p><p>cold. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
