<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ZAGREB 000621 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/06/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, IZ, HR, UNSC </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZ01: DEMARCHES ON UNGA AND CHR SESSIONS: GOC REPLY IS </p><p>"CAUTIOUS" </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 70678 </p><p> </p><p>     B. STATE 70649 </p><p>     C. ZAGREB 615 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: CLASSIFIED BY NICHOLAS HILL, POL/ECON COUNSELOR, </p><p>FOR REASONS: 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.   (C) DCM DELIVERED MARCH 18 REFTEL DEMARCHES TO MARIO </p><p>    NOBILO, ASSISTANT FOREIGN MINISTER FOR MULTILATERAL AFFAIRS. </p><p>DCM EXPLAINED THE U.S. DECISION NOT TO SEEK ANOTHER UNSC </p><p>RESOLUTION AND URGED THAT THE GOC NOT SUPPORT HOLDING AN UNGA </p><p>EMERGENCY SESSION ON IRAQ NOR USE THE COMMISSION ON HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS FOR DISCUSSING THE CURRENT SITUATION CONCERNING IRAQ. </p><p>NOBILO SAID HE UNDERSTOOD OUR POSITION, AND SAID THE GOC </p><p>WOULD BE "CAUTIOUS" ABOUT USING THESE VENUES, ALTHOUGH HE </p><p>AGREED THAT THE UNCHR WOULD NOT BE AN APPROPRIATE FORUM. </p><p>CROATIA DID NOT WANT TO SEE FURTHER HARM TO THE UN. </p><p> </p><p>2.   (C) IN DISCUSSING REFTELS, NOBILO STATED THE GOC\'S </p><p>DISAPPOINTMENT THAT THE U.S. HAD DECIDED TO WORK "OUTSIDE" </p><p>THE SECURITY COUNCIL CONTEXT.  HE SAID HE HOPED A WAR WOULD </p><p>BE SHORT AND THAT LOSS OF LIFE WOULD BE MINIMIZED.  HE SAID </p><p>THE GOC WAS VERY CONCERNED THAT A CONFLICT WOULD CONTRIBUTE </p><p>TO A SPREAD OF TERRORISM.  THE ASSISTANT MINISTER ADDED THAT </p><p>HE HOPED CROATIA WOULD BE A "PARTNER" IN POST CONFLICT </p><p>INSTITUTION BUILDING. </p><p> </p><p>3.   (C) THE DCM UNDERSCORED DISAPPOINTMENT WITH PRESS </p><p>REPORTS EARLIER ON MARCH 18 INDICATING THAT, IN ANNOUNCING </p><p>THAT HIS MARCH 18-19 TRIP TO LONDON HAD BEEN CANCELLED, PRIME </p><p>MINISTER RACAN HAD SAID TO THE PRESS THAT CROATIA AND THE UK </p><p>OBVIOUSLY WERE "NOT ON THE SAME SIDE" (REF C).  FURTHERMORE, </p><p>THE PM HOPED THE U.S. WOULD "UNDERSTAND" THE GOC\'S POSITION. </p><p>THE DCM SAID THAT, IN FACT, THE U.S. DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE </p><p>GOC POSITION; WE WERE VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT CROATIA HAD </p><p>FAILED TO JOIN THE COALITION TO DISARM IRAQ.  MOREOVER, WE </p><p>HOPED THAT PM RACAN DID NOT MEAN TO SUGGEST THAT CROATIA AND </p><p>THE UK WERE NOT ON THE SAME SIDE VIS-A-VIS THE IRAQ REGIME. </p><p> </p><p>    4.   (C) NOBILO RESPONDED THAT HE HAD NOT SEEN TRANSCRIPTS OF </p><p>EXACTLY WHAT THE PRIME MINISTER SAID.  THE KEY PROBLEM FOR </p><p>RACAN WAS THAT ALL THE FOCUS OF A LONDON VISIT WOULD HAVE </p><p>BEEN ON IRAQ, AND CLEARLY CROATIA HAD A DIFFERENT VIEW. </p><p>INDEED, IF RACAN HAD TRAVELLED TO LONDON, NOBILO FEARED, THE </p><p>"ENTIRE DISCUSSION" WOULD HAVE BEEN OVER IRAQ.  (WE LEARNED </p><p>SEPARATELY FROM UK SOURCES THAT THE IRAQ SITUATION MEANT THE </p><p>BRITISH COULD NOT GUARANTEE RACAN A MEETING WITH PM BLAIR.) </p><p>ROSSIN </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p></p></div>
