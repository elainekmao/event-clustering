(SBU) Per reftel request we provide the following </p><p>information: </p><p> </p><p>==  Zimbabwe is not currently an AGOA beneficiary and </p><p>government behavior both before and since the recent </p><p>presidential election continues to drastically reduce the </p><p>prospect of it qualifying in the near and likely medium </p><p>term, absent a change of government.  In all four broad </p><p>areas (market economy, rule of law, poverty reduction and </p><p>human rights) Zimbabwe has been and looks set to continue </p><p>backslidng.  Serious threats to and attacks on an open- </p><p>market economy based on respect for private property </p><p>rights and the rule of law are sponsored and carried out </p><p>by the GOZ.  Politically-driven, disastrous, economic </p><p>policies are still being pursed, causing disposable </p><p>income, the formal job count and standards of living to </p><p>fall precipitously. </p><p> </p><p>==  Examples of such policies are myriad and include: the </p><p>illegal occupation, looting and seizure of commercial </p><p>farms with government sanction and support; violence </p><p>directed at opposition political party members and </p><p>supporters; a fraudulent election; intimidation of the </p><p>judiciary, independent press and labor movement; non- </p><p>equal protection under the law; a blind eye turned to </p><p>corruption and cronyism; price controls and a grossly </p><p>undervalued official currency peg; circumvention of the </p><p>mandated tender processes; the control of hard currency </p><p>proceeds from exports, and threats by President Mugabe to </p><p>seize or nationalize all non indigenous-owned commercial </p><p>and productive assets in the country. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) We have conducted no AGOA outreach training or </p><p>programming, and though the private sector and many civil </p><p>servants would like to see policies change so as to enjoy </p><p>AGOA benefits, current conditions and the outlook remain </p><p>far from even minimal compliance from either the spirit </p><p>or letter of the legislation. </p><p> </p><p>WHITEHEAD </p><p></p></div>
