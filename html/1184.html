<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L THE HAGUE 001929 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SECDEF FOR OSD/ISA - NATO </p><p>JCS FOR J-5 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/27/2010 </p><p>TAGS: KPKO, PREL, MARR, ER, ET, NL, UNSC </p><p>SUBJECT: SHIRBRIG SUPPORT FOR ETHIOPIA/ERITREA PEACE: DUTCH </p><p>WEIGHING PARTICIPATION </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. SECSTATE 121009 </p><p>     B. COPENHAGEN 2465 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by A/Polcouns Eric Lundberg, Reasons 1.5 b/d </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.(C) The Dutch MFA is studying the UN military advisors </p><p>request for Dutch a contribution to a SHIRBRIG operation in </p><p>Ethiopia/Eritrea (refs a and b).  MFA UN Political expert </p><p>Marjolijn van Deelen told A/Polcouns on June 26 that no Dutch </p><p>decision will be made until a satisfactory UN mandate and </p><p>command structure are defined.  However, Van Deelen observed </p><p>that a prospective deployment of Dutch forces to </p><p>Ethiopia/Eritrea was more doable than the recently-declined </p><p>Dutch participation in UNAMSIL in Sierra Leone, since the </p><p>former presented a more clear-cut mission that could </p><p>reasonably remain within a Chapter VI mandate.  Another </p><p>selling point, of course, is that SHIRBRIG commander General </p><p>Patrick Cammaert is a Dutchman. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.(SBU) Discussions within the Dutch government are currently </p><p>focused on whether participation in a Horn of Africa </p><p>operation meet the criteria adopted by the current coalition </p><p>in 1994 for participation in peacekeeping operations.  These </p><p>criteria are as follows: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Dutch interests served (which include international peace </p><p>and security); </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Clear mandate, consistent with international law; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Solidarity and credibility of international support; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Evident support over the long term among participants and </p><p>countries of the region; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Dutch parliamentary and public support; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Concrete objectives; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Realizable objectives; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Burden sharing among a PKO participants; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Available Dutch military units; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Clear command structure (no duel key); </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Satisfactory risk level; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Adequate rules of engagement; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Adequate (UN or other) financial support; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Clear timetable for Dutch force participation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.(C) Ref B notes that the Dutch will be asked to contribute, </p><p>in priority order, an infantry battalion with engineer </p><p>company, one role 2 medical hospital, one helicopter wing, or </p><p>one brigade headquarters company.  Van Deelen said that the </p><p>nature of the Dutch contribution would be determined once a </p><p>decision to participate was made -- in other words, the </p><p>availability or not of particular units would not determine </p><p>the ultimate decision.  Within the next day, she said, the </p><p>MFA would determine whether to participate in an initial </p><p>SHIRBRIG survey mission to Ethiopia/Eritrea.  Thereafter, she </p><p>advised, deliberations would continue within the GON on the </p><p>question of larger Dutch participation, with the MFA UN </p><p>Affairs department taking the lead. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.(C) There does not appear to have been any MFA-MOD </p><p>consultation on this proposal.  Notwithstanding our MFA </p><p>contact\'s confidence that military commitments would follow </p><p>political decisionmaking on Dutch deployment, mission is not </p><p>entirely confident that the Dutch military at this moment has </p><p>the force flexibility or budget wherewithal to deploy a </p><p>battalion-plus force to the Horn of Africa.  End comment. </p><p>SCHNEIDER </p><p></p></div>
