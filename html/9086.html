<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 001143 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS; NSC FOR E. MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:   DECL: 07-01-13 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PTER, PINS, NO, JA, CE, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  Sri Lanka:  Peace process poised to enter new </p><p>phase </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  (A) Oslo 1298, and previous </p><p> </p><p>       (B) Colombo 1121, and previous (notal) </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Donald Camp, Charge d\'Affaires. </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b, d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  With the prime minister back from a </p><p>successful visit to the United Kingdom, Sri Lanka\'s </p><p>peace process is on the verge of entering a new phase. </p><p>The Tigers are hinting at a return to talks, while the </p><p>government is preparing an interim administration </p><p>proposal.  The Liberation Tigers\' of Tamil Eelam </p><p>(LTTE\'s) political leader Thamilchelvam told the </p><p>Japanese ambassador on June 30 that the LTTE sought to </p><p>respond positively.  These developments, however, take </p><p>place in an atmosphere of continued Tiger violence and </p><p>tension in the south.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>POSITIVE TIGER HINTS </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Recent actions by the Tigers continue to </p><p>indicate a possible thaw in their hardline stance </p><p>towards the government\'s efforts to resume peace </p><p>negotiations.  As previously reported, June 23 comments </p><p>by LTTE theoretician Anton Balasingham about a possible </p><p>resumption of talks followed his London meeting -- the </p><p>first since Tokyo -- with Norwegian facilitators.  Since </p><p>then, the Tigers have continued to reach out to the </p><p>international community, finally accepting a Japanese </p><p>offer to brief them on the Tokyo conference.  (Note: </p><p>Efforts by the Japanese to visit both the Tigers in the </p><p>Wanni and Balasingham in London immediately following </p><p>the June 9-10 conference were spurned as the group </p><p>continued its hardline stance.)  On June 30, the </p><p>Japanese ambassador traveled to the Wanni for a meeting </p><p>with LTTE political leader S.P. Thamilchelvam. </p><p>Afterwards, Japanese Embassy contacts described the </p><p>meeting to poloff as "cordial and constructive."  They </p><p>said Thamilchelvam seemed intent on waiting for the next </p><p>GSL proposal before agreeing to talks, but that the LTTE </p><p>was seeking to respond positively.  When contacted, a </p><p>Tamil National Alliance (TNA) parliamentarian in the </p><p>east, Joseph Pararajasingham, told us that he too felt </p><p>hopeful about the current situation. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Meanwhile, the June 27 LTTE-sponsored Pongu </p><p>Tamil ("Rising Tamil") rally in Jaffna reportedly had </p><p>fewer participants than originally forecast.  Embassy </p><p>contacts described the event as "placid."  Speakers </p><p>reportedly made no reference to the stalled peace talks. </p><p> </p><p>GSL DELIBERATE RE NEXT STEPS </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) In the wake of the prime minister\'s recent trip </p><p>to London (June 22-30), the government is drafting a </p><p>proposal for an interim administration.  While in </p><p>London, the PM and his delegation reportedly consulted </p><p>with senior British government officials on the legal </p><p>challenges facing Sri Lanka\'s reconstruction efforts. </p><p>Key government minister G.L. Peiris at a June 26 </p><p>briefing stated the GSL would be offering a new draft </p><p>proposal by mid-July.  In a follow-up comment to poloff, </p><p>Peiris stressed the proposal was merely the next step of </p><p>an ongoing process, but one that would require careful </p><p>deliberation.  The GSL\'s conduct suggests it is putting </p><p>more work into this current proposal for an interim </p><p>administration than in previous drafts.  (Note:  In the </p><p>lead-up to the early June Tokyo donors conference, the </p><p>GSL offered draft administration proposals almost daily </p><p>to the Tigers, who rejected them almost as quickly.) </p><p>TNA member Pararajasingham said he expected a favorable </p><p>Tiger response to the GSL\'s draft proposal. </p><p> </p><p>NORWEGIANS REGROUP </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) In a good sign from the peace process </p><p>facilitators, Norwegian polchief Tomas Stangeland </p><p>confirmed that former ambassador Jon Westborg has just </p><p>returned to Sri Lanka as a special envoy to shepherd the </p><p>peace process while the current ambassador, Hans </p><p>Brattskar, is out of the country for several weeks. </p><p>Norwegians and LTTE reports speculate that the </p><p>Norwegians could schedule a GSL-Tiger meeting sometime </p><p>in August or September, with Switzerland as a possible </p><p>venue. </p><p> </p><p>LTTE-INVOLVED KILLINGS CONTINUE </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Meanwhile, tensions in the South and the Tamil </p><p>community continued to mount over increased LTTE </p><p>violence.  The Tigers are alleged to be responsible for </p><p>the killing of a former member of an anti-LTTE political </p><p>party on June 27, in addition to an unsuccessful attempt </p><p>to storm a prison and release a fellow cadre detained on </p><p>murder charges.  Both incidents took place in the east. </p><p>(Note:  These incidents follow the previously reported </p><p>killings of a highly-respected counterterrorism police </p><p>officer in Colombo on June 23 and an anti-LTTE Tamil </p><p>politician in Jaffna on June 14, both with the hallmarks </p><p>of a Tiger hit.)  Opposition Leader Mahinda Rajapakse </p><p>and key presidental confidant Lakshman Kadirgamar called </p><p>attention to these killings during conversations with </p><p>Charge on June 26 and 27.  Both men spoke of their </p><p>growing distrust for the Tigers, even as they stressed </p><p>that no one supported a return to violence. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) The tension continued as increased security in </p><p>Colombo was apparent over the June 28-29 weekend.  While </p><p>press reports detailed the detention of "hundreds of </p><p>Tamils," police contacts have told us that most have </p><p>been released, with only a small number of individuals </p><p>being held for interrogation.  Interior Minister John </p><p>Amaratunga, during a June 30 meeting with Charge, </p><p>characterized the Tiger activity as "isolated </p><p>incidents," and said that increased security measures </p><p>were temporary. </p><p> </p><p>MONITORING MISSION REPORTS ON SHIP SINKING </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) The Norwegian-led Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission </p><p>(SLMM) on June 27 released its report on the June 14 </p><p>sinking of a suspected LTTE arms vessel off Mullativu. </p><p>The SLMM said that neither party violated the ceasefire </p><p>agreement and the GSL was within its rights in </p><p>challenging the ship.  It said the LTTE ship was in </p><p>violation of the United Nations Convention on the Law of </p><p>the Sea by not flying "an appropriate flag, and </p><p>official, visible identification."  The report urges </p><p>both parties to contact the SLMM more promptly in the </p><p>future, and lays the burden of reaching an agreement </p><p>preventing future sea clashes "as soon as possible" on </p><p>the GSL and LTTE.  Both sides have received the report </p><p>without comment, with the entire SLMM report being </p><p>posted on the pro-LTTE website, TamilNet. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) The recent comments by both the GSL and the </p><p>Tigers point to positive signs on the surface for a </p><p>resumption of peace process talks.  Underneath, however, </p><p>the Tigers\' continued violence and the government\'s </p><p>security measures indicate each are wary of being too </p><p>optimistic.  Despite all the undercurrents, the prospect </p><p>for restarting face-to-face negotiations is the most </p><p>hopeful since the early June conference in Tokyo.  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>CAMP </p><p></p></div>
