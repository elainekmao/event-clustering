<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L TEL AVIV 015987 </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR NEA, NEA/IAI, SMEC AND S/CT </p><p>LONDON FOR SUTPHIN; PARIS FOR LIEF </p><p>NSC FOR RIEDEL/MALLEY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/14/09 </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PGOV, KPAL, IS </p><p>SUBJECT: ISRAELI RAID KILLS HAMAS ACTIVISTS </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY POL/C JOHN SCOTT.  REASON 1.5(B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) THE GOI\'S BUREAU FOR COUNTERTERRORISM CONFIRMED </p><p>ON DECEMBER 14 THAT AN IDF SPECIAL FORCES UNIT KILLED </p><p>EIAD BATAT AND NADER MASALMAH IN A FIREFIGHT THE EVENING </p><p>OF DECEMBER 13.  THE CLASH OCCURRED IN THE VILLAGE OF </p><p>BEIT AWWA, IN AREA B, APPROXIMATELY 10 KMS WEST OF </p><p>HEBRON, NEAR THE GREEN LINE.  ACCORDING TO MEDIA </p><p>REPORTS, BATAT AND MASALMAH OPENED FIRE ON THE IDF UNIT </p><p>AS IT APPROACHED THE HOUSE THEY WERE IN.  THE SPECIAL </p><p>FORCES UNIT RETURNED FIRE, KILLING BATAT AS HE TRIED TO </p><p>ENTER A VEHICLE TO FLEE AND MASALMAH, AS HE FIRED ON THE </p><p>ISRAELIS FROM THE ROOF OF THE HOUSE.  THE EIGHT OTHERS </p><p>IN THE HOUSE AT THE TIME -- INCLUDING A WOMAN AND </p><p>CHILDREN -- WERE UNHARMED.  BATAT REPORTEDLY WAS </p><p>CARRYING A HANDGUN AND EXPLOSIVES.  GOI SOURCES TOLD THE </p><p>MEDIA THAT BASED ON "EVIDENCE" AT THE SCENE AND </p><p>"INTELLIGENCE" INFORMATION, IT APPEARED THAT BATAT AND </p><p>MASALMAH WERE PREPARING TO CARRY OUT A TERRORIST ATTACK. </p><p>THREE INDIVIDUALS WERE ARRESTED IN THE RAID, INCLUDING </p><p>RELATIVES OF MASALMAH. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) ACCORDING TO LTCOL UDI LEVI OF THE </p><p>COUNTERTERRORISM BUREAU, THE IDF UNIT HAD SPECIFIC </p><p>INFORMATION ABOUT BATAT\'S AND MASALMAH\'S WHEREABOUTS. </p><p>LEVI DESCRIBED BATAT AS A "SENIOR" FIGURE IN THE HAMAS </p><p>MILITARY WING WHO HAD BEEN INVOLVED IN A FIREFIGHT IN </p><p>THE OTNIEL SETTLEMENT SW OF HEBRON LAST JANUARY, IN </p><p>WHICH ONE BORDER POLICE OFFICER WAS KILLED AND ONE IDF </p><p>SOLDIER WOUNDED.  LEVI SAID BATAT HAD BEEN OPERATING IN </p><p>THE SOUTHERN WEST BANK FOR SOME TIME.  HE DESCRIBED THE </p><p>DECEMBER 13 RAID AS THE GOI\'S MOST SUCCESSFUL AGAINST </p><p>HAMAS SINCE THE SEPTEMBER 1998 ATTACK -- ALSO NEAR </p><p>HEBRON -- WHICH KILLED THE ABWADALLAH BROTHERS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) IN RESPONSE TO THE RAID, HAMAS LEADERS PUBLICLY </p><p>VOWED TO CONTINUE ATTACKING ISRAELIS AND WARNED THAT </p><p>ISRAEL BORE FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CONSEQUENCES OF </p><p>THE ATTACK.  PA LEGISLATOR HANAN ASHRAWI CONDEMNED THE </p><p>RAID, TELLING THE MEDIA THAT BATAT AND MASALMAH HAD BEEN </p><p>KILLED IN COLD BLOOD, AS PART OF THE GOI\'S POLICY OF </p><p>"DELIBERATELY TARGETING, THEN ASSASSINATING" WANTED </p><p>INDIVIDUALS THEY COULD NOT OTHERWISE BRING TO JUSTICE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) COMMENT:  LEVI WOULD NOT CONFIRM (BUT DID NOT </p><p>DENY) THAT THE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY WAS INVOLVED IN </p><p>PROVIDING SPECIFIC INFORMATION ABOUT BATAT\'S AND </p><p>MASALMAH\'S WHEREABOUTS, SINCE BEIT AWWA LIES IN THE AREA </p><p>UNDER JOINT GOI-PA CONTROL.  ALTHOUGH BATAT HAS LONG </p><p>BEEN SOUGHT BY THE GOI, MASALMAH IS A NEWCOMER WHOSE </p><p>NAME HAS  NOT APPEARED PREVIOUSLY ON ANY GOI LIST OF </p><p>KNOWN TERRORISTS.  HE SIMPLY MAY HAVE BEEN IN THE WRONG </p><p>PLACE AT THE WRONG TIME. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>WALKER </p><p></p></div>
