LABOR </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Turkish labor force numbers around 20.2 million persons, </p><p>with nearly 35 percent employed in agriculture.  The </p><p>official unemployment rate was 12.3 percent in the first </p><p>quarter of 2003.  Students are required to complete eight </p><p>years of schooling and to remain in school until they are 15 </p><p>years old.   Turkey has an abundance of unskilled and semi- </p><p>skilled labor.  However, there is a shortage of qualified </p><p>workers for highly automated high-tech industries. </p><p>Individual high-tech firms, both local and foreign-owned, </p><p>have generally conducted their own training programs for </p><p>such job categories.  Vocational training schools for some </p><p>commercial and industrial skills exist in Turkey at the high </p><p>school level.  Apprenticeship programs, both formal and </p><p>informal, remain in place, although they are dying out in </p><p>some traditional occupations.  Turkey\'s labor force has a </p><p>reputation for being hardworking, productive and dependable. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Labor-management relations have been generally good in </p><p>recent years.  Employers are obliged by law to negotiate in </p><p>good faith with unions that have been certified as </p><p>bargaining agents.  Strikes are usually of short duration </p><p>and almost always peaceful.  Since 1980 Turkey has faced </p><p>criticism by the International Labor Organization (ILO), </p><p>particularly for shortcomings in enforcement of ILO </p><p>Convention 98 (right to organize and collective bargaining). </p><p>In 2003, Parliament approved  a Job Security Bill, which </p><p>aims to ensure consultation between employers and labor </p><p>groups in some areas while providing employers with greater </p><p>flexibility in laying off staff. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The 1995 and 2001 constitutional amendments reduced </p><p>restrictions on the right to strike to a certain degree and </p><p>civil servants (defined broadly as all employees of the </p><p>central government ministries, including teachers) are </p><p>allowed to form trade unions and to engage in limited </p><p>collective negotiations, but are prohibited from striking. </p><p>A recent amendment to Free Zones Law No. 3218 rescinds the </p><p>prohibition against the right to strike in these zones. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The GOT and the civil service unions will begin negotiations </p><p>on a new two-year contract. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15.  FOREIGN TRADE ZONES/FREE PORTS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Since passage of the Turkish law on free zones in 1985, 21 </p><p>zones have been established.  The zones are open to a wide </p><p>range of activity, including manufacturing, storage, </p><p>packaging, trading, banking, and insurance.  Foreign </p><p>products enter and leave the free zones without payment of </p><p>any customs or duties.  Income generated in the zones is </p><p>exempt from corporate and individual income taxation and </p><p>from the value-added tax, but firms are required to make </p><p>social security contributions for their employees. </p><p>Additionally, standardization regulations in Turkey do not </p><p>apply to the activities in the free zones, unless the </p><p>products are imported into Turkey.  In contrast to most </p><p>other free zones, sales to the Turkish domestic market are </p><p>allowed. </p><p>Goods and revenues transported from the zones into Turkey </p><p>are subject to all relevant import regulations.  There are </p><p>no restrictions on foreign firms operations in the free </p><p>zones.  Indeed, the operator of one of Turkey\'s most </p><p>successful free zones located in Izmir is an American firm. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16.  FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT STATISTICS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>According to Turkish Treasury data, as of  November 2002, </p><p>there are 6,311 foreign firms invested and are operating in </p><p>Turkey.  The Turkish government has provided permits for </p><p>foreign capital since 1980 amounting to USD  34.0 billion, </p><p>and aggregate actual inflows reached USD  15.7 billion.  In </p><p>2002, EU countries accounted for  63.6 percent of authorized </p><p>new foreign investment, OECD countries accounted for  90.4 </p><p>percent, and Islamic countries for  2.6 percent.  Over the </p><p>past two decades, France (16.6 percent) has been the top </p><p>source of foreign investment, followed by the Netherlands ( </p><p>15.7 percent), Germany (12.7 percent) and the U.S. (11.6 </p><p>percent)  (Note: these figures are based on the amount of </p><p>authorized investment, not on actual capital inflows). </p><p>Because of the absence of a bilateral tax treaty until 1998, </p><p>much U.S.-origin capital was invested in Turkey through </p><p>third-country subsidiaries.  By unofficial estimates the </p><p>U.S. may be the largest source of foreign investment in </p><p>Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In 2002, about  58.0 percent of authorized foreign </p><p>investment took place in services,  39.8 percent in </p><p>manufacturing, and about  2.2 percent in mining and </p><p>agriculture combined.  The sub-sectors with the greatest </p><p>amount of authorized foreign investment include banking </p><p>(10.3 percent);; trade ( 11.4 percent); food, beverage and </p><p>tobacco processing ( 11.9 percent); and insurance (7.7 </p><p>percent).  Between 1980 and November  2002, 45.0 percent of </p><p>actual capital inflows were invested in services,  52.0 </p><p>percent in manufacturing,  2.0 percent in agriculture, and </p><p>1.0 percent in mining.  The  food industry, trade and </p><p>finance sectors received the highest share of increased </p><p>foreign direct investment permits in 2002. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FDI Inflow by Years (million USD) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Year           Actual    Inflow/GDP      No firms </p><p>                    Inflow                   (Cumulative) </p><p>1980-1988      1,172 </p><p>1989             663        0.80           1,525 </p><p>1990             684        0.67           1,856 </p><p>1991             907        0.69           2,123 </p><p>1992             911        0.78           2,330 </p><p>1993             746        0.56           2,554 </p><p>1994             636        0.64           2,830 </p><p>1995             934        0.66           3,163 </p><p>1996             914        0.53           3,582 </p><p>1997             852        0.54           4,068 </p><p>1998             953        0.49           4,533 </p><p>1999             813        0.41           4,950 </p><p>2000           1,707        0.85           5,328 </p><p>2001           3,288        2.21           5,841 </p><p>2002(*)          569        0.48           6,311 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>TOTAL          15,749                      6,311 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Source: General Directorate of Foreign Investment; (*) </p><p>January through November 2002. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FDI Inflow by Source Country (1999-2002/ million USD) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Country        Cumulative Value    Share (percent) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Italy               1,968               30.9 </p><p>Netherlands           962               15.1 </p><p>U.S.A.                793               12.4 </p><p>United Kingdom        647               10.1 </p><p>Germany               514                8.1 </p><p>Bahrain               323                5.1 </p><p>Japan                 267                4.2 </p><p>France                263                4.1 </p><p>Switzerland           104                1.6 </p><p>Belgium-Luxemburg      25                0.4 </p><p>Spain                  23                0.4 </p><p>Others                488                7.7 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Total               6,377              100.0 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turkey\'s External Investment by Country (As of December </p><p>2002) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Country           Amount          Share </p><p>                              (USD millions) </p><p>Netherlands         1,868.2       30.9 </p><p>United Kingdom        523.1        8.9 </p><p>Germany               532.7        8.8 </p><p>Luxembourg            245.8        4.1 </p><p>Russia                163.7        2.7 </p><p>Azerbaijan            741.8       12.3 </p><p>Kazakhstan            431.5        7.1 </p><p>United States         192.6        3.2 </p><p>Romania               122.7        2.0 </p><p>Others              1,218.6       20.1 </p><p>                          6,040.8       100.0 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Source: General Directorate of Banking and Foreign Exchange, </p><p>Treasury </p><p>Major foreign investors </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turkey\'s largest foreign investors include Telecom Italia, </p><p>Renault, Toyota, Fiat, Castrol, Enron Power, Citibank, </p><p>Pirelli Tire, Unilever, RJR Nabisco, Philip Morris, United </p><p>Defense, Honda, Hyundai, Bosch, Siemens, DaimlerChrysler, </p><p>Chase Manhattan, AEG, Bridgestone-Firestone, Cargill, </p><p>Novartis, Coca Cola, Colgate-Palmolive, General Electric, </p><p>General Motors-Opel, ITT, Ford Motor Co., Lockheed Martin, </p><p>Gillette, Goodyear, Hilton International, Aventis, </p><p>McDonald\'s, Nestle, Mobil, Pepsi, Pfizer, Procter and </p><p>Gamble, InterGen, Abbot Laboratories, Aria and Shell. </p><p>Pearson </p><p></p></div>
