<p>UNCLAS STATE 229666 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EPET, ENRG, PREL, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: TALKING POINTS ON IRAQI SUSPENSION OF OIL EXPORTS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  BACKGROUND: ON DECEMBER 1, IRAQ SUSPENDED OIL EXPORTS </p><p>WHICH FUND THE UN OPERATED OIL-FOR-FOOD PROGRAM.  IT DID SO </p><p>EVEN THOUGH THE SECURITY COUNCIL AGREED TO ALLOW SHIPMENTS </p><p>TO CONTINUE UNTIL UN OFFICIALS COULD CONCLUDE A PRICING </p><p>MECHANISM THAT REFLECTS A FAIR MARKET VALUE FOR IRAQ\'S </p><p>DECEMBER EXPORTS.  AT PRESENT, IT APPEARS THAT THE MARKET </p><p>HAS DISCOUNTED IRAQ\'S MOVE. THE PRICE OF CRUDE OIL FOR </p><p>JANUARY DELIVERY FELL $1.80 DECEMBER 1 AND CLOSED AT $32.02 </p><p>A BARREL. </p><p> </p><p>2.  OVER THE PAST YEAR, POSTS HAVE ENGAGED HOST COUNTRIES </p><p>ON A VIGOROUS DIALOGUE CONCERNING THE OIL MARKETS. WE </p><p>BELIEVE THAT THIS LATEST IRAQI PROVOCATION COULD IMPACT </p><p>LESS DEVELOPED COUNTRIES, AND EMERGING ECONOMIES IN A </p><p>NEGATIVE MANNER IF REDUCED OIL SUPPLIES LEAD TO LARGE PRICE </p><p>INCREASES OR SIGNIFICANT MARKET INSTABILITY. WE ARE WORKING </p><p>WITH MAJOR OIL PRODUCERS AND WITHIN THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>ENERGY AGENCY TO MITIGATE THE OIL MARKET IMPACT. POSTS MAY </p><p>DRAW ON FOLLOWING TALKERS, WITH HOST GOVERNMENTS OR IN </p><p>PUBLIC, AS APPROPRIATE: </p><p> </p><p>Q: IRAQ HAS MADE GOOD ON ITS THREAT TO CUT OIL SHIPMENTS. </p><p>IS THE U.S. CONCERNED ABOUT THE EFFECT ON GLOBAL MARKETS? </p><p> </p><p>A: IRAQ\'S SUSPENSION OF OIL EXPORTS IS AN ATTEMPT TO COERCE </p><p>THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.  IRAQ SUBMITTED PROPOSED OIL </p><p>PRICES TO THE UN FOR DECEMBER THAT WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER </p><p>THAN WORLD MARKET PRICES.  THE UN PANEL OF OIL EXPERTS - </p><p>THE INTERNATIONAL OVERSEERS - RECOMMENDED AGAINST APPROVING </p><p>THOSE PRICES.  THE UN\'S IRAQ SANCTIONS COMMITTEE </p><p>UNANIMOUSLY AGREED.  WE CANNOT ACCEPT IRAQ\'S USE OF OIL AS </p><p>A POLITICAL TOOL. </p><p> </p><p>THE UNITED STATES IS WORKING WITH THE INTERNATIONAL ENERGY </p><p>AGENCY MEMBERS AND MAJOR OIL PRODUCERS, ON AN OIL SUPPLY </p><p>RESPONSE WHICH, IF NEEDED, WOULD COMPENSATE FOR THE OIL </p><p>VOLUMES WHICH IRAQ IS THREATENING TO WITHDRAW FROM THE </p><p>WORLD MARKET.  THIS RESPONSE WOULD INCLUDE DRAWDOWNS FROM </p><p>STRATEGIC PETROLEUM STOCKS AS APPROPRIATE. </p><p> </p><p>THE UNITED STATES AND THE IEA ARE READY TO TAKE ACTION TO </p><p>ADD SUPPLY VERY QUICKLY IF THE SITUATION WARRANTS. </p><p> </p><p>IRAQ SHOULD NOT BELIEVE THAT A CESSATION OF OIL EXPORTS </p><p>WILL GAIN IT ANY LEVERAGE WITH THE UNITED NATIONS.  WE CALL </p><p>ON IRAQ TO WORK WITH THE UNITED NATIONS TO QUICKLY REACH AN </p><p>AGREEMENT ON THE OIL PRICING ISSUE. </p><p> </p><p>Q: WHY HASN\'T THE UN APPROVED A NEW PRICING STRUCTURE FOR </p><p>DECEMBER?  WHAT\'S THE U.S. VIEW ON THIS? </p><p> </p><p>A: IRAQ SUBMITTED PROPOSED PRICES TO THE UN FOR DECEMBER </p><p>THAT ARE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN WORLD MARKET PRICES.  THE </p><p>UN PANEL OF EXPERTS - THE INTERNATIONAL OVERSEERS - </p><p>RECOMMENDED AGAINST APPROVING THOSE PRICES.  THE UN\'S IRAQ </p><p>SANCTIONS COMMITTEE UNANIMOUSLY AGREED.  WE SUPPORT THIS </p><p>JUDGEMENT.  IRAQ\'S PROPOSED PRICING MAY NOT BE ADEQUATE TO </p><p>MEET THE HUMANITARIAN NEEDS OF THE IRAQI PEOPLE AND WOULD </p><p>CREATE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR UNAUTHORIZED PAYMENTS OUTSIDE </p><p>THE OIL-FOR-FOOD PROGRAM. </p><p> </p><p>WE BELIEVE THIS ISSUE SHOULD BE RESOLVED CONSISTENT WITH </p><p>THE INTENT OF UN RESOLUTIONS, WHICH WERE DESIGNED TO MEET </p><p>THE HUMANITARIAN NEEDS OF THE IRAQI PEOPLE. </p><p> </p><p>3. MINIMIZE CONSIDERED. </p><p>ALBRIGHT </p><p></p></div>
