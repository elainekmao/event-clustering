<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 VATICAN 005167 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPT. EUR/WE (MENNUTI) </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PREL, PGOV, SOCI, PREL, PGOV, SOCI, VT, VTPHUM </p><p>SUBJECT: VATICAN BACKS U.S. BISHOPS\' SEXUAL ABUSE POLICY, </p><p>BUT SEEKS CANONICAL DUE PROCESS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) IN AN OCTOBER 18 LETTER TO THE U.S. CONFERENCE OF </p><p>CATHOLIC BISHOPS, THE HOLY SEE CONVEYED ITS SUPPORT FOR THE </p><p>U.S. BISHOPS\' EFFORTS TO ADDRESS SEXUAL ABUSE ISSUES, BUT </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  05167  01 OF 02  231022Z </p><p>ALSO INDICATED ITS DESIRE FOR REVISIONS IN THE BISHOP\'S </p><p>ABUSE POLICY DOCUMENT ADOPTED IN DALLAS IN JUNE 2002. </p><p>ALTHOUGH JUDGED POSITIVELY AS A WHOLE, THE DOCUMENT WAS SEEN </p><p>BY THE VATICAN TO BE AMBIGUOUS AND CONFUSED IN SOME PARTS, </p><p>AS WELL AS CONTRARY TO THE LAWS OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH </p><p>(CANON LAW).  A COMMISSION OF FOUR U.S. BISHOPS AND FOUR </p><p>VATICAN OFFICIALS WILL CONDUCT THE REVISION, EXPECTED TO BE </p><p>COMPLETED IN TIME FOR THE U.S. BISHOPS\' NEXT MEETING IN </p><p>NOVEMBER.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>BISHOPS\' POLICY ON TRACK, BUT FINE-TUNING NEEDED </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) THE MUCH-ANTICIPATED VATICAN RESPONSE TO THE U.S. </p><p>CONFERENCE OF CATHOLIC BISHOPS\' "NORMS FOR DIOCESAN POLICIES </p><p>DEALING WITH ALLEGATIONS OF SEXUAL ABUSE OF MINORS BY </p><p>PRIESTS, DEACONS, OR OTHER CHURCH PERSONNEL," CONVEYED IN A </p><p>LETTER FROM THE PREFECT OF THE HOLY SEE\'S CONGREGATION </p><p>(DEPARTMENT) FOR BISHOPS, CARDINAL GIOVANNI BATTISTA RE, </p><p>EXPRESSED STRONG SUPPORT FOR THE BISHOPS\' EFFORTS TO RESPOND </p><p>TO THE SEX ABUSE PROBLEM IN THE U.S.  THE HOLY SEE EXPRESSED </p><p>"FULL SOLIDARITY" WITH THE U.S. BISHOPS\' CONDEMNATION OF </p><p>SEXUAL MISDEEDS AND SUPPORT FOR THEIR EFFORTS TO "RESPOND </p><p>FIRMLY" TO THE MISDEEDS OF A "VERY SMALL NUMBER" OF CHURCH </p><p>PERSONNEL.  CARDINAL RE EMPHASIZED THAT THE HOLY SEE REGARDS </p><p>SEXUAL ABUSE OF MINORS AS "PARTICULARLY ABHORRENT."  AT THE </p><p>SAME TIME, THE RE LETTER ALSO MADE CLEAR THAT THE VATICAN </p><p>SAW POTENTIAL FOR CONFUSION AND MISINTERPRETATION IN SOME </p><p>ASPECTS OF THE NORMS.  RE\'S LETTER IS THE FRUIT OF MONTHS OF </p><p>INTERNAL DISCUSSION AMONG FIVE VATICAN DEPARTMENTS.  IT </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  05167  01 OF 02  231022Z </p><p>REFLECTED THE UNEASE FELT HERE THAT CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF </p><p>THE NORMS COULD VIOLATE THE DUE-PROCESS RIGHTS OF ACCUSED </p><p>CLERGY. </p><p> </p><p>3.   (U) THE HOLY SEE\'S CONCERNS WITH THE U.S. NORMS ARE </p><p>CENTERED ON THE MECHANISMS FOR ADMINISTERING THE POLICY, ITS </p><p>COMPATIBILITY WITH CANON LAW, AND LACK OF CLARITY IN SOME </p><p>TERMINOLOGY.  FOR EXAMPLE, THE HOLY SEE IS CONCERNED ABOUT </p><p>THE POTENTIAL CHALLENGE TO A BISHOP\'S AUTHORITY BY SO-CALLED </p><p>"REVIEW BOARDS" -- BODIES WITH A HEAVY LAY COMPONENT </p><p>MONITORING HOW SEX ABUSE ACCUSATIONS ARE DEALT WITH -- WHICH </p><p>ARE TO BE SET UP IN EVERY DIOCESE.  THE U.S. DOCUMENT </p><p>DEFINES THESE AS CONSULTATIVE, HOWEVER, THE VATICAN BELIEVES </p><p>THEY COULD SEEK TO ASSERT AUTHORITY OVER BISHOPS TO HOLD </p><p>THEM ACCOUNTABLE.  THE HOLY SEE ALSO EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT </p><p>THE DEFINITION OF "SEXUAL ABUSE."  THE "NORMS" DEFINE SEXUAL </p><p>ABUSE BROADLY, INCLUDING NON-PHYSICAL ACTS.  THE VATICAN </p><p>SEES THIS AS "VAGUE AND IMPRECISE AND THEREFORE DIFFICULT TO </p><p>INTERPRET." </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) AN ADDITIONAL CONCERN IS THAT THE NORMS GO FURTHER </p><p>THAN CANON LAW AND RECENT PAPAL DIRECTIVES IN DEALING WITH </p><p>PRIESTS CONVICTED OF SEXUAL ABUSE -- EITHER IN A CIVIL OR </p><p>CHURCH COURT.  INSTANT DISMISSAL FROM THE CLERICAL STATE -- </p><p>THE SO-CALLED "ONE STRIKE AND YOU\'RE OUT" POLICY -- DOES NOT </p><p>CONFORM TO CHURCH LAW.  (COMMENT:  THE VATICAN ALSO MAKES A </p><p>DISTINCTION BETWEEN ABUSE AND SEXUAL MISDEMEANOR, E.G., A </p><p>YOUNG PRIEST HAVING A CONSENSUAL RELATIONSHIP WITH A 17 YEAR- </p><p>OLD GIRL. INDEED, FROM THE VATICAN PERSPECTIVE THE LATTER </p><p>RELATIONSHIP IS NOT A CIVIL MISDEMEANOR IN MANY COUNTRIES </p><p>WHERE PRIESTS WORK.  END COMMENT.)  ALTHOUGH THE U.S. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  05167  01 OF 02  231022Z </p><p>BISHOPS MAINTAIN THAT CURRENT CHURCH LAW PROCEDURES WILL BE </p><p>RESPECTED, THE VATICAN IS SEEKING CHANGES TO SPECIFY EXACTLY </p><p>HOW THIS WILL BE DONE. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) TO ACHIEVE THESE REFINEMENTS AND PROVIDE THE VATICAN </p><p>"RECOGNITIO" REQUESTED BY THE U.S. BISHOPS FOR THEIR POLICY, </p><p>THE HOLY SEE AND THE U.S. BISHOPS HAVE CREATED A MIXED </p><p>COMMISSION OF FOUR U.S. BISHOPS AND FOUR REPRESENTATIVES </p><p>FROM THE HOLY SEE DICASTERIES HAVING A ROLE IN THE MATTERS </p><p>UNDER REVIEW -- THE CONGREGATION FOR THE DOCTRINE OF THE </p><p>FAITH, THE CONGREGATION FOR BISHOPS, THE CONGREGATION FOR </p><p>THE CLERGY, AND THE PONTIFICAL COUNCIL FOR LEGISLATIVE </p><p>TESTS.  THEIR REVISIONS ARE EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED IN TIME </p><p>FOR THE NEXT U.S. BISHOPS MEETING IN NOVEMBER.  AFTER THE </p><p>BISHOPS INCORPORATE THE CHANGES INTO THEIR\' NORMS, THE HOLY </p><p>SEE WOULD THEN APPROVE THE REVISED DOCUMENT (PROVIDE </p><p>"RECOGNITIO"), WHICH THEN AUTOMATICALLY BECOMES BINDING FOR </p><p>THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IN THE UNITED STATES (THOUGH NOT </p><p>ELSEWHERE). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ5751 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        VATICA  05167  02 OF 02  231022Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AMAD-00  CIAE-00  DODE-00  DS-00    UTED-00 </p><p>      VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   LAB-01   VCE-00   NSAE-00  TEST-00 </p><p>      DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-02   SAS-00     /003W </p><p>                  ------------------FCA70A  231023Z /38 </p><p>R 230934Z OCT 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY VATICAN </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC </p><p>INFO WHITE HOUSE WASHDC </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 02 VATICAN 005167 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPT.

(SBU) CONTRARY TO MEDIA REPORTS SUGGESTING THAT THE HOLY </p><p>SEE REJECTED THE U.S. BISHOPS\' PROPOSALS, THE HOLY SEE\'S </p><p>RESPONSE IS BROADLY SUPPORTIVE WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY </p><p>CONCERNED THAT THE U.S. PROPOSALS -- HAMMERED OUT RAPIDLY </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  05167  02 OF 02  231022Z </p><p>LAST SUMMER UNDER AN INTENSE MEDIA SPOTLIGHT -- LACK THE </p><p>PRECISION AND CLARITY NEEDED TO ENSURE AN EFFECTIVE POLICY </p><p>THAT BOTH PROTECTS MINORS FROM ABUSE WHILE PROVIDING </p><p>ADEQUATE SAFEGUARDS FOR CLERGY IN THE FACE OF POTENTIAL </p><p>FALSE ALLEGATIONS.  THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT THE VATICAN </p><p>WANTS TO DEAL EFFECTIVELY WITH THE PROBLEM OF SEXUAL ABUSE </p><p>BY CLERGY, BUT DOES NOT WANT TO DO SO AT THE COST OF </p><p>DEPRIVING CLERGY OF DUE PROCESS.  THE HOLY SEE DOES NOT AT </p><p>THIS TIME REGARD THE U.S. BISHOPS\' EFFORT AS A MODEL FOR THE </p><p>REST OF THE WORLD, WHERE IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES VOLUNTARY </p><p>NORMS HAVE ALREADY BEEN AGREED WITH THE TACIT APPROVAL OF </p><p>THE HOLY SEE.  NEVERTHELESS, THERE IS LITTLE DOUBT THAT THE </p><p>U.S. POLICY WILL BECOME A POINT OF REFERENCE FOR OTHER </p><p>COUNTRIES COMING TO TERMS WITH PAST CASES OF ABUSE.  FOR </p><p>THIS REASON, THE HOLY SEE WANTS TO BE SURE THAT THE U.S. </p><p>NORMS ARE FULLY CONSISTENT WITH CHURCH LAW AND PROVIDE A </p><p>LASTING BASIS TO PROTECT MINORS FROM ABUSE WHILE ENSURING </p><p>CANONICAL DUE PROCESS FOR ACCUSED CLERGY. </p><p> </p><p>HARDT </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> </p><p></p><p> 2002VATICA05167 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
