SULLIVAN FOR REASONS 1.5 B/D </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: THE UNDP-LED MISSION TO EVALUATE </p><p>COMPLIANCE WITH, AND SUGGEST WAYS FORWARD ON THE ABUJA </p><p>ACCORD ON LAND REFORM HAS FOUND MOSTLY FRUSTRATIONS AND </p><p>ONLY OCCASIONAL BRIGHT SPOTS DURING THEIR EXTENDED </p><p>MISSION IN ZIMBABWE.  PATTERNS VARY WIDELY ACROSS THE </p><p>COUNTRY, BUT THE DISRUPTION PROVOKED BY LACK OF CLEAR </p><p>DIRECTION IS CAUSING WIDESPREAD DIFFICULTIES IN </p><p>PLANTINGS FOR BOTH ORIGINAL FARMERS AND FOR NEW </p><p>SETTLERS.  SOME GOZ MINISTERS HAVE SOUGHT TO BULLY THE </p><p>UNDP-LED MISSION INTO ACCEPTING THE CHAOTIC PROCESS, BUT </p><p>THE TEAM SEEMS FIXED ON PRESENTING AN HONEST, IF NON- </p><p>CONFRONTATIONAL REPORT.  THE GOZ IS SUPPOSED TO SEND A </p><p>DELEGATION TO NY IN ANOTHER WEEK TO MEET WITH MARK </p><p>MALLOCH BROWN AND SEE WHAT FOLLOW-UP CAN BE GIVEN TO </p><p>TEAM RECOMMENDATIONS.  MOST UNDP-LED TEAM MEMBERS SEE </p><p>LITTLE PROSPECT FOR PROGRESS UNTIL AFTER ZIMBABWE\'S </p><p>ELECTIONS, BUT THEY WISH TO KEEP THE DOOR OPEN FOR </p><p>FUTURE ENGAGEMENT BY PRESENTING A SERIES OF </p><p>RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE STEPS. END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) DURING A NOVEMBER 29 LUNCHEON WITH THE UNDP-LED </p><p>TEAM, KEY GOZ MINISTERS AND SOME POTENTIAL DONORS, </p><p>EXCLUDING THE UK, THE AMBASSADOR HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO </p><p>SOUND OUT PROGRESS OF THE PROLONGED MISSION.  TEAM </p><p>LEADER ABDULLAH JANNE TOLD US THAT THE TEAM HAD FOUND </p><p>MANY PROBLEMS AND ONLY A FEW BRIGHT SPOTS.  HE SAID THE </p><p>TEAM HAD TRAVELLED THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY AND HAD WIDE- </p><p>RANGING CONVERSATIONS TO EVALUATE THE STATE OF THE ABUJA </p><p>AGREEMENT ON LAND AND PROSPECTS FOR INTERNATIONAL </p><p>ENGAGEMENT ON LAND REFORM.  JANNE SAID THE TEAM WOULD </p><p>DEPART THE MIDDLE OF DEC 2 WEEK AND ISSUE A REPORT OF </p><p>OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS WHICH WOULD IDENTIFY </p><p>POSITIVE AREAS TO FOLLOW THROUGH ON AND PROBLEMS WHICH </p><p>NEEDED TO BE ADDRESSED.  A GOZ TEAM LED BY AGRICULTURE </p><p>MINISTER MADE WOULD THEN TRAVEL TO NY FOR ENGAGMENT WITH </p><p>THE UNDP. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) OTHER TEAM MEMBERS, INCLUDING WORLD BANK, IMF AND </p><p>EU REPRESENTATIVES, TOLD US THAT THE PROGRESS OF </p><p>GOVERNMENT LAND REFORM EFFORTS VARIED WIDELY WITH THE </p><p>ABSENCE OF CLEAR RULES AND DISRUPTION OF PRODUCTION MOST </p><p>PREVALENT.  A POSITIVE EXCEPTION WAS MIDLANDS PROVINCE </p><p>WHERE THE PROVINCIAL GOVERNOR, SENIOR GOVERNMENT </p><p>MINISTERS COMMERCIAL FARMERS AND SETTLERS ALL WORKING </p><p>COLLABORATIVELY TO OVERCOME MOST PROBLEMS THAT HAVE </p><p>EMERGED IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF LAND REDISTRIBUTION. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03612  01 OF 02  031909Z </p><p>AS A RESULT, IN MIDLANDS TILLING IS PROCEEDING ON BOTH </p><p>COMMERCIAL AND SETTLED FARMS.  TEAM MEMBERS GAINED THE </p><p>IMPRESSION OF CONSIDERABLE DIFFERENCES WITHIN THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT ITSELF.  FOR EXAMPLE, THEY WERE TOLD THAT THE </p><p>AGRICULTURE MINISTER\'S RECENT DECLARATION OF LOW LIMITS </p><p>ON MAXIMUM FARM SIZE TO BE ENFORCED BY GOVERNMENT LAND </p><p>ACQUISITION WOULD NEVER BE APPROVED BY THE PARLIAMENT. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) AT THE NOV 29 LUNCHEON, AGRICULTURE MINISTER MADE </p><p>WAS HIS USUALLY AGGRESSIVE SELF TOWARD TEAM LEADER JANNE </p><p>IN FRONT OF A TABLE OF ABOUT EIGHT OTHER TEAM MEMBERS </p><p>AND DONORS.  MADE ACCUSED JANNE\'S TEAM OF ASKING </p><p>INTRUSIVE QUESTIONS IN THEIR FARM VISITS WHICH SHOWED </p><p>LACK OF RESPECT FOR THE GOVERNMENT\'S REPORT OF THE </p><p>STATUS OF THE RESETTLEMENT PROCESS.  JANNE, A NATIVE OF </p><p>SIERRA LEONE, KEPT HIS COOL, BUT WE UNDERSTAND THAT </p><p>UNSYG KOFI ANNAN WAS VERY UPSET WITH GOZ TREATMENT OF </p><p>HIS MISSION. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) THE AMBASSADOR WAS SEATED AT A TABLE WITH </p><p>MINISTER OLIVA MUCHENA, WHO WORKS ON LAND ISSUES WITH </p><p>VICE PRESIDENT MSIKA.  MUCHENA, WHO HAS WORKED CLOSELY </p><p>WITH THE COOPERATIVE LAND REFORM INITIATIVE, ZJIRI, SAID </p><p>SHE WAS WORKING HARD WITH THE COMMERCIAL FARMERS AND </p><p>PRIVATE SECTOR PARTICIPANTS IN THE ZJIRI INITIATIVE TO </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ1197 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  03612  02 OF 02  031454Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00  CTME-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  DOEE-00  DOTE-00  WHA-00   PERC-00  SRPP-00  DS-00 </p><p>      EAP-00   EB-00    EUR-00   EXIM-01  E-00     FAAE-00  VC-00 </p><p>      FRB-00   H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    ITC-01   L-00 </p><p>      VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00 </p><p>      PC-01    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    SSO-00 </p><p>      STR-00   USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-02   G-00 </p><p>      NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00    /012W </p><p>                  ------------------46427F  031454Z /38 </p><p>P 031402Z DEC 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 0456 </p><p>INFO USMISSION USUN NEW YORK PRIORITY </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>NSC WASHDC </p><p>DEPT TREAS WASHDC </p><p>USDOC WASHDC </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p>AMEMBASSY ABUJA </p><p>AMEMBASSY OTTAWA </p><p>AMEMBASSY CANBERRA </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 003612 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF/S, AF/EX, HR/OE </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JFRAZER </p><p>USDOC FOR 2037 JDIEMOND </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  03612  02 OF 02  031454Z </p><p>NAIROBI PASS TO ASSISTANT SECRETARY WKANSTEINER </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>PRETORIA FOR AG ATTACHE </p><p>PASS USTR - ROSA WHITAKER </p><p>TREASURY FOR ED BARBER AND C.
