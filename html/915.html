<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 MADRID 011809 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>S/CT FOR REAP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS:  PTER, SP </p><p>SUBJECT:  SPAIN:  1997 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT </p><p> </p><p>REF.  STATE 203771 </p><p> </p><p>1.  THE ONLY TERRORIST GROUP OPERATING IN SPAIN IS THE BASQUE </p><p>TERRORIST GROUP ETA (FATHERLAND AND LIBERTY), WHICH CONTINUED </p><p>IN 1997 ITS CAMPAIGN OF MURDER, BOMBINGS, KIDNAPPINGS, AND </p><p>STREET VIOLENCE.  THE GOVERNMENT HAD SOME SUCCESS AGAINST ETA </p><p>DURING THE YEAR, WITH KEY ARRESTS IN SPAIN AND FRANCE AND </p><p>EXTRADITIONS OF ETA TERRORISTS FROM FRANCE AND LATIN AMERICA. </p><p>MANY LATIN AMERICAN GOVERNMENTS CONTINUE TO HARBOR ETA </p><p>TERRORISTS, HOWEVER, IN RESPONSE TO WHICH THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>LAUNCHED A CAMPAIGN TO CONVINCE LATIN AMERICAN AND OTHER </p><p>GOVERNMENTS OF THE TRUE NATURE OF ETA.  THE MARXIST TERRORIST </p><p>GROUP "GRAPO" WAS INACTIVE IN 1997 AND SOME OF ITS LEADERS </p><p>WERE RELEASED FROM PRISON.  SPAIN SOUGHT WITH LIMITED SUCCESS </p><p>AT THE JUNE EU SUMMIT IN AMSTERDAM TO SECURE AGREEMENT ON A </p><p>PROTOCOL AIMED AT PREVENTING AN EU MEMBER STATE FROM GRANTING </p><p>POLITICAL ASYLUM TO A NATIONAL OF ANOTHER EU MEMBER STATE. </p><p>ALSO IN 1997 THE AUTHORITIES BROKE UP A RING OF THE ALGERIAN </p><p>ISLAMIC TERRORIST GROUP GIA OPERATING IN SPAIN.  THERE WERE NO </p><p>ACTS OF TERRORISM IN SPAIN IN 1997 AGAINST OR AFFECTING U.S. </p><p>CITIZENS OR FACILITIES. </p><p> </p><p>THE FOLLOWING RESPONSES ARE KEYED TO PARAGRAPH 3 REFTEL. </p><p> </p><p>A)  ARRESTS AND PROSECUTIONS OF ETA TERRORISTS WERE ONGOING </p><p>THROUGHOUT THE YEAR.  THERE ARE OVER 500 ETA TERRORISTS IN </p><p>SPANISH JAILS AND THE NUMBER IS INCREASING.  FOR THE FIRST </p><p>TIME, THE GOVERNMENT MOVED IN 1997 TO PROSECUTE ETA\'S </p><p>POLITICAL WING, THE HERRI BATASUNA (HB) POLITICAL PARTY, WHICH </p><p>HAS SEATS IN THE NATIONAL AND BASQUE REGIONAL PARLIAMENTS. </p><p>ALL 23 MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL COMMITTEE (EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE) </p><p>OF THIS LEGAL POLITICAL PARTY WERE BROUGHT TO TRIAL IN OCTOBER </p><p>ON CHARGES OF VIOLATING THE SPANISH LAW CRIMINALIZING </p><p>COLLABORATION WITH AN ARMED BAND.  THE CHARGE STEMS FROM HB\'S </p><p>DISSEMINATION DURING THE 1996 NATIONAL ELECTION CAMPAIGN OF A </p><p>VIDEO CONTAINING FOOTAGE OF ETA TERRORISTS ADVOCATING </p><p>VIOLENCE.  ON DECEMBER 1, SENTENCES OF SEVEN YEARS AND FINES </p><p>OF ABOUT 3,500 DOLLARS FOR EACH OF THE 23 WERE ANNOUNCED. </p><p> </p><p>B)  THE SPANISH GOVERNMENT HAS ENERGETICALLY SOUGHT </p><p>EXTRADITION FROM COUNTRIES IN WHICH ETA FUGITIVES RESIDE, AND </p><p>HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL, PARTICULARLY WITH REGARD TO FRANCE. </p><p>FRENCH-SPANISH COOPERATION IN 1997 HAS LED TO KEY ARRESTS OF </p><p>ETA LEADERS AND EXTRADITIONS FROM FRANCE TO SPAIN. JUST BEFORE </p><p>THE FRENCH-SPANISH SUMMIT IN DECEMBER, THE FRENCH INTERIOR </p><p>MINISTER ANNOUNCED THAT IN 1996, 144 PEOPLE DIRECTLY OR </p><p>INDIRECTLY CONNECTED WITH ETA WERE ARRESTED ON FRENCH SOIL AND </p><p>IN THE FIRST 10 MONTHS OF 1997 53 SUCH PERSONS WERE ARRESTED, </p><p>23 OF THEM SPANISH BASQUES.  THE MINISTER ADDED THAT 62 ETA </p><p>ACTIVISTS WERE TGRIED IN FRANCE IN 1997, AND THAT SINCE </p><p>JANUARY 1, 1996, 23 SPANISH ETA TERRORISTS WERE EXTRADITED AND </p><p>HANDED OVER TO SPANISH AUTHORITIES.  SPAIN HAS ALSO SOUGHT </p><p>EXTRADITIONS FROM LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES.  THE DOMINICAN </p><p>REPUBLIC AND MEXICO EXTRADITED ETA TERRORISTS TO SPAIN IN </p><p>1997.  THERE HAVE BEEN NO TERRORIST RELATED U.S. REQUESTS FOR </p><p>EXTRADITION IN 1997. </p><p> </p><p>C)  THERE HAVE BEEN NO IMPEDIMENTS TO GOS PROSECUTION OR </p><p>EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS. </p><p> </p><p>D)  SPANISH GOVERNMENT LEADERS, INCLUDING PRESIDENT JOSE MARIA </p><p>AZNAR AND INTERIOR MINISTER JAIME MAYOR OREJA, HAVE </p><p>REPEATEDLY, FREQUENTLY, AND PUBLICLY DENOUNCED ETA TERRORISM. </p><p>THEY SIMILARLY SPEAK OUT PUBLICLY AGAINST TERRORIST INCIDENTS </p><p>IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND ELSEWHERE.  FOLLOWING THE KIDNAPPING </p><p>AND MURDER OF A TOWN COUNSELOR IN JULY, THE GOS PUT FORWARD </p><p>LEGISLATION TO STRENGTHEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AGAINST TERRORISM. </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOT CHANGED ITS POLICY OF WILLINGNESS TO </p><p>ENGAGE IN A DIALOGUE WITH ETA PROVIDED ETA FIRST RENOUNCES </p><p>VIOLENCE. </p><p> </p><p>E)  THE DAILY REQUIREMENTS OF THE ONGOING STRUGGLE AGAINST ETA </p><p>CONSUME A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF THE TIME AND RESOURCES OF THE </p><p>GOS.  THAT ASIDE, THE FOLLOWING INTERVENTIONS IN THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL ARENA BY THE GOVERNMENT ARE NOTEWORTHY.  IN </p><p>NOVEMBER 1996 SPAIN BECAME THE FIRST MEMBER OF THE EU TO </p><p>RATIFY THE EUROPEAN EXTRADITION TREATY SIGNED ON SEPTEMBER 27, </p><p>1996.  SPAIN SIGNED A NUMBER OF EXTRADITION TREATIES WITH </p><p>LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES.  THE GOS INTRODUCED MEASURES FOR </p><p>CONSIDERATION BY THE EU\'S INTER-GOVERNMENTAL CONFERENCE THAT </p><p>WOULD HAVE MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR A MEMBER STATE TO GRANT </p><p>POLITICAL ASYLUM TO A NATIONAL OF ANOTHER MEMBER STATE, BUT </p><p>DUE TO CONSIDERABLE OPPOSITION FROM CERTAIN EU MEMBERS, A MUCH </p><p>WATERED DOWN VERSION WAS EVENTUALLY APPROVED AT THE JUNE EU </p><p>AMSTERDAM SUMMIT.  THE AGREED TEXT PRESERVES THE RIGHT TO </p><p>GRANT ASYLUM TO A NATIONAL OF ANOTHER EU MEMBER STATE BUT </p><p>MERELY REQUIRES THE ASYLUM GRANTING STATE TO INFORM THE </p><p>EUROPEAN COUNCIL (THE REST OF THE EU MEMBER STATES) OF ITS </p><p>ACTION.  SPANISH CONCERN ON THIS ISSUE IS MOTIVATED BY THE </p><p>SEVERAL YEARS OLD REFUSAL OF BELGIUM TO EXTRADITE TWO ETA </p><p>TERRORISTS TO SPAIN ON THE GROUNDS THAT THE REQUEST FOR </p><p>POLITICAL ASYLUM OF THE TWO MUST BE RESOLVED IN THE BELGIAN </p><p>COURT SYSTEM FIRST.  OTHER ACTIONS BY THE GOS DURING THE YEAR </p><p>INCLUDED THE MAKING AND DISTRIBUTION OF A VIDEO PURPORTING TO </p><p>TELL THE TRUE STORY OF ETA, INTENDED MAINLY FOR DISTRIBUTION </p><p>IN LATIN AMERICA, WHERE SOME GOVERNMENTS AND PUBLIC OPINION IN </p><p>SOME COUNTRIES CONTINUE TO VIEW ETA IN ROMANTIC, "FREEDOM </p><p>FIGHTER" TERMS.  TO REINFORCE THE VIDEO, A BIPARTISAN </p><p>DELEGATION OF THE SPANISH PARLIAMENT TRAVELLED TO SELECTED </p><p>LATIN AMERICAN STATES TO REINFORCE THE MESSAGE OF THE VIDEO. </p><p>PRESIDENT AZNAR, ON A VISIT TO CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA, </p><p>ANNOUNCED THE SIGNING OF NEW EXTRADITION AGREEMENTS WITH </p><p>VARIOUS STATES OF THE REGION, INCLUDING PANAMA. </p><p> </p><p>F)  THERE WAS NO SPANISH GOVERNMENT SUPPORT FOR TERRORISM IN </p><p>1997. </p><p> </p><p>G)  THE SPANISH GOVERNMENT MADE NO PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN </p><p>SUPPORT OF A TERRORIST-SUPPORTING COUNTRY ON A TERRORISM ISSUE </p><p>IN 1997. </p><p> </p><p>H)  THERE HAS BEEN NO CHANGE SINCE 1996 IN THE SPANISH </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S ATTITUDE TOWARD TERRORISM, INTERNATIONAL OR </p><p>DOMESTIC. </p><p> </p><p>I)  UNDER THE NEW TRANSATLANTIC AGENDA, SIGNED IN MADRID IN </p><p>DECEMBER 1995, THE U.S. AND THE EU, OF WHICH SPAIN IS A </p><p>MEMBER, MAINTAIN ONGOING ANTI-TERRORIST COOPERATION ACROSS A </p><p>BROAD FRONT.  THE FIRST BILATERAL COUNTERTERRORISM </p><p>CONSULTATIONS WITH THE U.S. TOOK PLACE IN MAY, WHEN THE GOS </p><p>HOSTED A DELEGATION LED BY THE DEPARTMENT COORDINATOR FOR </p><p>SECURITY AND COUNTER TERRORISM.  THE GOS HAS REQUESTED THAT </p><p>BILATERAL TERRORISM CONSULTATIONS WITH THE U.S. BE </p><p>INSTITUTIONALIZED ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. </p><p> </p><p>J)  GOS COUNTERTERRORISM COOPERATION WITH THE U.S. IS </p><p>EXCELLENT.  AN EXAMPLE OF THIS WAS THE DECEMBER 4, 1996 </p><p>SPANISH EXTRADITION OF ACHILLE LAURO HIJACKER MAJID AL-MOLQI, </p><p>TO ITALY.  GOS OFFICIALS WERE AWARE OF THE CONSIDERABLE U.S. </p><p>INTEREST IN AL-MOLQI\'S EXTRADITION.  AL MOLQI HAD FAILED TO </p><p>RETURN TO PRISON IN ROME IN FEBRUARY 1996 AT THE END OF A 12- </p><p>DAY PAROLE.  HE WAS LATER PICKED UP IN SPAIN. </p><p> </p><p>K)  THE USG HAS NOT IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS SOUGHT SPANISH </p><p>COOPERATION IN THE PREVENTION OF ANY PARTICULAR ACT OF </p><p>INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM AGAINST U.S. CITIZENS OR INTERESTS. </p><p> </p><p>ROSSIN </p><p></p></div>
