(C) SUMMARY. During a private meeting with the Ambassador </p><p>on June 20, the Cardinal expressed heightened concern over </p><p>the pervasiveness of drug-related corruption at the highest </p><p>levels of government as well as continuing death threats he </p><p>had received. Cardinal Oscar Andres Rodriguez Maradiaga used </p><p>the bully pulpit of his chairmanship of the National </p><p>Anti-Corruption Council to raise questions about a corrupt </p><p>political arrangement that was allegedly negotiated between </p><p>Liberal Party President Rafael Pineda Ponce and former </p><p>Honduran President Rafael Leonardo Callejas.  The Cardinal\'s </p><p>criticisms were widely reported by the media as truth and </p><p>spawned a fiery response from Pineda Ponce, who challenged </p><p>the Cardinal to come forward with his evidence of the </p><p>supposed deal.   END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p>CARDINAL EXPRESSES CONCERN OVER CORRUPTION/DEATH THREATS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Cardinal Rodriguez expressed significant concern that </p><p>drug-related corruption had penetrated the highest levels of </p><p>the Congress and the Public Ministry in a June 20 meeting </p><p>with the Ambassador.  He provided the Ambassador with a </p><p>confidential document from an informant, outlining </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>allegations of corruption within the Public Ministry.  (Note: </p><p>Embassy had previously received this document from another </p><p>source.)  The Cardinal believes the culture of corruption and </p><p>impunity in Honduras to be so pervasive that he was planning </p><p>to resign from his position as Chair of the CNA. </p><p>Additionally, the Cardinal relayed that threats to his life </p><p>have continued in recent weeks. He has accepted an offer from </p><p>the Ministry of Public Security for a single police officer </p><p>to serve as a security detail during his public appearances </p><p>only.  The Ambassador urged the Cardinal not to resign and to </p><p>continue his vigilance in fighting corruption. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) During a March discussion with the Ambassador, </p><p>Cardinal Rodriguez privately confided that he had received a </p><p>recent death threat that merited concern (ref A).  Though </p><p>Post has been unable to assess the credibility of the </p><p>gatekeeper\'s kidnapping story, the Cardinal interpreted the </p><p>kidnapping to represent an escalation in the seriousness of </p><p>threats to his life.  The Cardinal indicated to the </p><p>Ambassador in March that the recent threats would not deter </p><p>his anti-corruption campaign. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>ACCUSATIONS AGAINST PINEDA PONCE AND CALLEJAS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) According to May 20 press reports, Cardinal Oscar </p><p>Andres Rodriguez Maradiaga, Archbishop of Tegucigalpa (who is </p><p>also rumored to be a potential successor to Pope John Paul II </p><p>(ref B)) raised questions during a meeting of the National </p><p>Anti-Corruption Council (CNA) that a corrupt political </p><p>arrangement may have been negotiated between Liberal Party </p><p>President Rafael Pineda Ponce, the former president of </p><p>Congress who ran unsuccessfully against Ricardo Maduro for </p><p>president in 2001, and former Honduran President Rafael </p><p>Leonardo Callejas (1990-94), a Nationalist.  According to the </p><p>Cardinal, who described his sources as "faithful," Callejas </p><p>influenced Nationalist Party judges on the Supreme Court to </p><p>dismiss the case against the son-in-law of Pineda Ponce, </p><p>Jorge Adolfo Chavez Hernandez, a former member of Battalion </p><p>3-16, who has been accused of masterminding the 1998 murder </p><p>of environmentalist and Catacamas (in the Department of </p><p>Olancho) town councilman, Carlos Antonio Luna Lopez.  The </p><p>Cardinal suggested that, in exchange, Pineda Ponce influenced </p><p>Liberal Supreme Court judges to dismiss seven pending </p><p>corruption cases against Callejas.  The Cardinal\'s </p><p>accusations call into question the legality of both </p><p>politicians\' actions as well as the credibility and </p><p>transparency of the Supreme Court.  These press reports were </p><p>confirmed by German Espinal, the Executive Director of the </p><p>CNA. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) (Note:  As stated in the Human Rights Report, in May </p><p>and July 2002, police arrested Chavez and Jose Angel Rosa in </p><p>the 1998 murder of Luna.  The arrests occurred after both the </p><p>prosecuting attorney and judge in the case received death </p><p>threats.  In May 2002 the local judge resigned from the court </p><p>because of these death threats.  Former security official </p><p>Jose Marcos Hernandez Hernandez and two other suspects still </p><p>remain at large and one other suspect in the murder, Oscar </p><p>Aurelio "Machetillo" Rodriguez Molina, remains in prison. </p><p>End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>REACTIONS OF THE ACCUSED </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) On June 18, after weeks of avoiding a direct </p><p>confrontation with the Cardinal, Pineda Ponce publicly </p><p>challenged the Cardinal to present his evidence to a court. </p><p>In a letter sent to Attorney General Roy Medina, Pineda Ponce </p><p>urged Medina to require the Cardinal to present his </p><p>information regarding the supposed political arrangement </p><p>between Pineda Ponce and Callejas.  The same week, Chavez </p><p>claimed his innocence in Luna\'s killing and accused the </p><p>Cardinal of lashing out at Honduran politicians as part of a </p><p>strategy for winning the papacy.  Callejas has not responded </p><p>publicly to the Cardinal\'s allegations but noted his deep </p><p>respect for the Cardinal as a moral leader.  The Cardinal has </p><p>declined to comment on Pineda Ponce\'s challenge.  Espinal </p><p>told EmbOffs that the Cardinal would present his testimony </p><p>and evidence to the Attorney General\'s Office on June 26 </p><p>during a sworn deposition. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>THE CARDINAL\'S ANTI-CORRUPTION CAMPAIGN </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) As chair of the CNA, Cardinal Rodriguez is leading a </p><p>campaign to implement a 20-year national anti-corruption </p><p>strategy (refs C and D).  President Ricardo Maduro </p><p>(Nationalist Party) ratified and endorses the work of the </p><p>CNA, which receives funding from the World Bank, the </p><p>Inter-American Development Bank, the United Nations </p><p>Development Programs, as well as from several bilateral </p><p>donors, such as USAID.  Last year, the Cardinal called for </p><p>the creation of an international court to try corruption </p><p>cases and to channel confiscated funds back into developing </p><p>countries.  The Cardinal has urged Hondurans to acknowledge </p><p>the depths of the corruption problem and to support an </p><p>anti-corruption strategy buttressed by political will. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>CARDINAL CLAIMS DEVELOPED COUNTRIES APATHETIC </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) In a private meeting with the Ambassador in March, </p><p>the Cardinal also expressed his desire that the international </p><p>community employ stricter conditionalities on developing </p><p>countries as a deterrent to corruption.  During the week of </p><p>June 7, the Cardinal publicly charged developed countries </p><p>apathetic toward what he considers to be an exorbitant debt </p><p>burden and crushing interest rates in developing countries. </p><p>The Cardinal deemed a lack of political will, and not a lack </p><p>of funds, to be the chief impediment to resolving the debt </p><p>problem in developing countries.  In particular, the Cardinal </p><p>cited the multi-billion dollar commitment of developed </p><p>nations to wage war in Iraq as an example of the availability </p><p>of funds and political will to employ them. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>INFLUENCE OF CARDINAL GIVES COMMENTS ADDED WEIGHT </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) Comment:  Even though the details surrounding the </p><p>Cardinal\'s statements on Pineda Ponce and Callejas have yet </p><p>to be revealed, both the Honduran media and the public at </p><p>large have embraced the story as truth.  Meanwhile, Pineda </p><p>Ponce\'s response to the Cardinal represents a bold and risky </p><p>political maneuver.  That Pineda Ponce chose to directly </p><p>address the alleged criticisms speaks to the perceived power </p><p>of the Cardinal\'s rhetoric to sting high profile figures.  A </p><p>recent public survey rated Cardinal Rodriguez the third most </p><p>powerful figure in Honduras, behind President Maduro and the </p><p>Ambassador.  Meanwhile, this unfolding drama appears to have </p><p>given voice to a Honduran public frustrated by rampant </p><p>corruption and impunity.  It has also sparked a vigorous </p><p>debate in the media about corruption in all major public </p><p>institutions, especially the Attorney General\'s Office and </p><p>the police.  Given the threats to the Cardinal\'s life, his </p><p>high political profile within Honduras and possible candidacy </p><p>for the papacy, both the allegations of pervasive </p><p>narco-corruption and concerns over the Cardinal\'s physical </p><p>security merit careful monitoring.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
