Malinowski for reasons 1.5 (b) and </p><p> (d). </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p>======= </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  On January 28, Foreign Minister Narendra Bikram Shah </p><p>briefed the Ambassador on his January 23-26 trip to Bhutan. </p><p>Shah revealed a timeline for the Twelfth and Thirteenth </p><p>bilateral Ministerial Meetings to restart the work of the </p><p>Joint Verification Team to repatriate Bhutanese refugees. </p><p>Bhutan\'s King Wangchuck appears to be personnally engaged in </p><p>establishing a compromise with Nepal to break through the </p><p>impasse.  The Government of Nepal (GoN) is cautiously </p><p>optimistic but will grade the Government of Bhutan\'s (GoB) </p><p>sincerity on the number of refugees it is willing to </p><p>repatriate.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>Bhutan\'s King is Engaged </p><p>======================== </p><p> </p><p>2. (S/NF)  In a late afternoon meeting with the Ambassador on </p><p>January 28, Foreign Minister Narendra Bikram Shah briefly </p><p>outlined the results of his trip to Bhutan (Ref A).  During </p><p>his trip, which was intended as an informal visit, Shah met </p><p>with Bhutan\'s Foreign Minister Thinley, Prime Minister Dorji, </p><p>and King Wangchuck in a setting where the King did most of </p><p>the talking.  According to Shah\'s account, the King walked </p><p>line-by-line through Bhutan\'s position paper to clarify the </p><p>intent of his government in resolving the impasse: </p><p> </p><p>-- Category 1, Forcibly Evicted Refugees:  The King affirmed </p><p>GoB\'s previous commitment to accept the return of these </p><p>refugees and acknowledges its responsibility for their </p><p>departure. </p><p> </p><p>-- Category 2, Voluntary Refugees:  The King told Shah that </p><p>under Bhutanese law, these individuals lost their citizenship </p><p>upon their departure from the Kingdom.  However, with great </p><p>objection from his Cabinet, the King will direct that the GoB </p><p>liberally interpret the citizenship law. In making this </p><p>concession, the King appealed to Shah for a reciprocal </p><p>commitment from the Government of Nepal--i.e., refugees in </p><p>this category will be asked to make a voluntary application </p><p>for citizenship to return to Bhutan, those individuals </p><p>unwilling to do so should be accepted by Nepal.  (Comment: As </p><p>descrbied by Shah, it is unclear if acceptance by Nepal </p><p>equates to citizenship or a form of immigration parole within </p><p>Nepal.  End comment.) </p><p> </p><p>-- Categories 3, Criminals, and 4, Non-Bhutanese:  According </p><p>to Shah, the King believes these two categories are much more </p><p>difficult.  Criminals assessed to be Bhutanese will be </p><p>allowed to return, as long as they are willing to face </p><p>charges in Bhutan.  However, the King stated that many </p><p>Category 4 refugees are really Indians seeking benefits. </p><p> </p><p>Cautious Optimism: Many a Slip Between a Cup and a Lip </p><p>============================================= ========= </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S/NF)  During their meeting, Shah and the Bhutanese King </p><p>committed to holding the long-delayed Twelfth Round of </p><p>ministerial-level talks in Kathmandu on February 14, the eve </p><p>of the donor roundtable meeting in Geneva.  Shah did not </p><p>provide any details of the meeting\'s agenda.  He did, </p><p>however, reveal that a Joint Verification Team would assemble </p><p>in Bhutan upon the Round\'s conclusion to sort through the </p><p>paperwork from the first verification exercise completed at </p><p>the Khundunabari refugee camp in December 2001 (Ref B). </p><p>Nepal\'s delegation would be led by the Home Ministry and </p><p>accompanied by the Director General of Immigration. </p><p>According to Shah, Bhutanese commitment must be demonstrated </p><p>in Bhutan\'s acceptance of Category 2 refugees in large </p><p>numbers.  A Thirteenth Round is tentatively scheduled for </p><p>March, where any outstanding difficulties from the Joint </p><p>Verification Team can be addressed, plans can be made for </p><p>emptying the Khundunabari camp, and a timeline and procedures </p><p>can be established to empty the remaining camps. </p><p> </p><p>Foreign Minister, "Let Our Two Countires Settle this Dispute" </p><p>============================================= ================ </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Shah emphasized the GoN and GoB desire to settle the </p><p>refugees bilaterally.  He is aware of the assistance offered </p><p>by third parties to help, but asks, "let our two countries </p><p>settle this dispute."  Shah was surprised and encouraged by </p><p>King Wangchuck\'s personal engagement on this issue.  However, </p><p>his optimism is tempered by the repeated delays in the </p><p>repatriation process. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>======= </p><p> </p><p>5.  (S/NF)  The change in tone from the GoB may augur a </p><p>bilateral breakthrough. However, Shah\'s caution is well </p><p>founded, with the GoN linking future talks upon the progress </p><p>of the Joint Verification Teams. Further, his appeal to </p><p>resolve the situation bilaterally may be interpreted as a </p><p>request to play down U.S. offers of third-country settlement. </p><p>The GoN might have concerns that offers of third-country </p><p>settlement could mitigate GoB\'s voluntary repatriation offer </p><p>for Category 2 refugees, as they may defer returning in light </p><p>of greater economic opportunities in the U.S. or elsewhere. </p><p>We believe it important that donors attending the February 17 </p><p>aid consortium meeting in Geneva be encouraged to press the </p><p>GoB to move ahead on resolving this long-standing issue (Ref </p><p>C). </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
