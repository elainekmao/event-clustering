<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 VATICAN 000135 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, PHUM, VT, VTPREL </p><p>SUBJECT: POPE\'S MESSAGE TO DIPLOMATIC CORPS FOCUSES ON WAR, </p><p>PEACE AND SOLIDARITY AMONG NATIONS </p><p> </p><p> ------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.    IN HIS ANNUAL SPEECH TO THE DIPLOMATIC CORPS JANUARY </p><p>13, POPE JOHN PAUL II OFFERED HIS PERSPECTIVE ON THE STATE OF </p><p>THE WORLD.  CITING THE CURRENT "FEAR THAT OFTEN DWELLS IN THE </p><p>HEARTS OF OUR CONTEMPORARIES," HE IDENTIFIED THE CAUSES OF </p><p>THIS FEAR AS: "INSIDIOUS TERRORISM, UNRESOLVED PROBLEMS IN </p><p>THE MIDDLE EAST INCLUDING THE HOLY LAND AND IRAQ, THE TURMOIL </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  00135  01 OF 02  141831Z </p><p>IN SOUTH AMERICA -- ARGENTINA, COLOMBIA AND VENEZUELA -- </p><p>FAMINE AND CONFLICTS IN AFRICA, PANDEMICS, AND ENVIRONMENTAL </p><p>EXPLOITATION.  THE POPE SOUGHT TO STRIKE A NOTE OF OPTIMISM </p><p>AMIDST THIS LITANY OF WOES, ASSERTING THAT RESPECT FOR LIFE, </p><p>RESPECT FOR LAW, AND SOLIDARITY CAN PREVENT HUMANITY FROM </p><p>"SINKING INTO THE ABYSS."  WHILE THE POPE MADE A STRONG </p><p>APPEAL AGAINST WAR, HE DID NOT CLOSE THE DOOR ON WAR AS A </p><p>LAST OPTION WITH THE APPROVAL OF THE UN.  CONTRARY TO </p><p>HEADLINES IN ONE ITALIAN PAPER, THE HOLY SEE TOLD US THEY ARE </p><p>NOT PLANNING ON SENDING ENVOYS TO IRAQ AND BAGDAD AT THIS </p><p>TIME. </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>WAR WITH IRAQ </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.    AS EXPECTED, THE POPE\'S ANNUAL ADDRESS TO THE </p><p>DIPLOMATIC CORPS STRONGLY REJECTED WAR, TERRORISM AND ARMED </p><p>VIOLENCE SPECIFICALLY IN ISRAEL/PALESTINIAN TERRITORIES AND </p><p>IRAQ.  WHILE THE MEDIA FOCUS WILL BE ON THE POPE\'S "NO TO </p><p>WAR," THE POPE ALSO MAINTAINED THE LINES OF THE FULL HOLY SEE </p><p>POSITION ON IRAQ WHICH RECOGNIZES THAT THE DECISION TO WAGE </p><p>WAR TO ENSURE THE COMMON GOOD WAS AN OPTION -- EVEN IF A LAST </p><p>ONE AND "IN ACCORDANCE WITH VERY STRICT CONDITIONS" (I.E., </p><p>THE HOLY SEE\'S INTERPRETATION OF THE JUST WAR THEORY). </p><p>ACCORDING TO THE POPE, ONLY THE UN HAD THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>AUTHORITY TO MAKE A DECISION TO WAGE WAR.  BUT HE </p><p>SPECIFICALLY UNDERLINED THAT CONFLICTS CAN BE AVOIDED BY </p><p>"GOOD WILL, TRUST IN OTHERS, FIDELITY TO COMMITMENTS AND </p><p>COOPERATION BETWEEN RESPONSIBLE PARTNERS."  HE ALSO </p><p>EMPHASIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF COUNTRIES RESPECTING COMMON AND </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  00135  01 OF 02  141831Z </p><p>INVIOLABLE PRINCIPLES IN ORDER TO GUARANTEE STABILITY TO ALL </p><p>PEOPLES. (COMMENT: WE TAKE THE PONTIFF\'S REFERENCE TO LIVING </p><p>UP TO ONE\'S COMMITMENTS AS A DIRECT APPEAL TO BOTH IRAQ AND </p><p>NORTH KOREA TO BEHAVE AS RESPONSIBLE MEMBERS OF THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.  END COMMENT). </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>SOLIDARITY AMONG NATIONS </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3.    THE POPE\'S SAID THE WORLD\'S VARIOUS CRISES COULD BE </p><p>AVERTED ONLY WITH RESPECT FOR LIFE, INCLUDING THE REJECTION </p><p>OF CLONING AND EUTHANASIA, AS WELL AS THE REJECTION OF WAR; </p><p>RESPECT FOR LAW AS A FOUNDATION FOR NATIONAL AND </p><p>INTERNATIONAL STABILITY; AND THE DUTY OF SOLIDARITY WITH LESS </p><p>FORTUNATE PEOPLES AND NATIONS AS A COUNTER TO VIOLENCE. HE </p><p>EXHORTED DEVELOPED NATIONS TO SHARE THEIR TECHNOLOGICAL </p><p>KNOW-HOW WITH DEVELOPING NATIONS.  HERE, HE SPECIFICALLY </p><p>CALLED ON THE DEVELOPED WORLD TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO WATER, AND </p><p>TO GENERIC MEDICINES TO FIGHT CURRENT PANDEMICS.  (COMMENT: </p><p>THE HOLY SEE REMAINS CONCERNED ABOUT THE COLLAPSE OF THE WTO </p><p>TALKS IN GENEVA LAST MONTH ON TRIPS, AND THEIR IMPLICATIONS </p><p>FOR THE POOREST COUNTRIES.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>CHRISTIAN EUROPE AND RESTRICTIVE RUSSIA </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.    THE POPE USED HIS ADDRESS TO REPEAT THE HOLY SEE\'S CALL </p><p>FOR CHRISTIANITY AND RELIGIOUS TRADITIONS TO BE ACKNOWLEDGED </p><p>IN A PROPOSED EUROPEAN CONSTITUTION.  ACCORDING TO THE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  00135  01 OF 02  141831Z </p><p>PONTIFF, THE NEWLY ENLARGED EUROPE IS THE FRUIT AND RECIPIENT </p><p>OF CHRISTIAN VALUES.  IN RECOGNITION OF THIS FOUNDATION, HE </p><p>CALLED FOR RELIGIOUS FREEDOM, STRUCTURES FOR DIALOGUE BETWEEN </p><p>NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS AND CHURCHES, AND PROTECTION OF ALREADY </p><p>GAINED NATIONAL JURIDICAL STATUS AS KEY CONSTITUTIONAL </p><p>ELEMENTS TO ASSURE CONTINUED PROTECTION OF RELIGION IN </p><p>EUROPE.  THE POPE MADE AN IMPASSIONED PLEA FOR RUSSIAN </p><p>AUTHORITIES TO ALLOW CATHOLIC CLERGY FREE ACCESS TO CONDUCT </p><p>THEIR PASTORAL WORK IN THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION.  HE </p><p>UNDERSCORED THAT HE WAS STILL WAITING FOR A FORMAL RESPONSE </p><p>FROM RUSSIAN REGARDING ITS REFUSALS OF VISAS TO FOREIGN </p><p>PRIESTS AND BISHOPS. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>AFRICA: REASONS TO REJOICE AND DESPAIR </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.    THE POPE GAVE SPECIAL FOCUS TO AFRICA, EXPRESSING </p><p>SATISFACTION THAT ANGOLA, BURUNDI, AND THE DEMOCRATIC </p><p>REPUBLIC OF CONGO AND EVEN SUDAN HAD EMBARKED ON THE PATH OF </p><p>PEACE.  TO BUILD ON THIS SUCCESS, HE URGED UNDERSTANDING AND </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ5146 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        VATICA  00135  02 OF 02  140740Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AMAD-00  CIAE-00  INL-00   DODE-00  DS-00 </p><p>      EUR-00   UTED-00  VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01 </p><p>      VCE-00   NSAE-00  TEST-00  DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-02   SAS-00 </p><p>        /003W </p><p>                  ------------------24F408  140741Z /38 </p><p>P 140715Z JAN 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY VATICAN </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>ARAB ISRAELI COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p>EUROPEAN POLITICAL COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 02 VATICAN 000135 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, VT </p><p>SUBJECT: POPE\'S MESSAGE TO DIPLOMATIC CORPS FOCUSES ON WAR, </p><p>PEACE AND SOLIDARITY AMONG NATIONS </p><p> </p><p>FINANCIAL AID FROM THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.  AT THE SAME </p><p>TIME, THE POPE LAMENTED THE RECENT VIOLENCE IN IVORY COAST </p><p>AND THE CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC, CALLING FOR CEASEFIRES AND </p><p>DIALOGUE.  HE LAUDED THE SUCCESS OF THE AFRICAN UNION AND </p><p>REGIONAL MEDIATION IN HELPING AFRICANS TO FIND THEIR OWN </p><p>SOLUTIONS TO THE CONTINENT\'S PROBLEMS.  HE MADE TWO </p><p>REFERENCES TO "THE GRAVE PROBLEM OF FAMINE" IN AFRICA -- A </p><p>POINT THE EMBASSY HAD SUCCESSFULLY FOUGHT TO INSERT IN THE </p><p>DIPLOMATIC CORPS DEAN\'S ADDRESS TO THE POPE. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  00135  02 OF 02  140740Z </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>PLEA FOR GOOD GOVERNANCE AND THE COMMON GOOD </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.    A COMMON THREAD OF THE DISCOURSE WAS THE POPE\'S CALL ON </p><p>POLITICAL LEADERS TO "SERVE THE COMMON GOOD."  HE STRESSED </p><p>THAT MORAL CONVICTION WAS ESSENTIAL TO POLITICAL LEADERSHIP </p><p>AND CALLED FOR "GOOD GOVERNANCE" THAT WOULD ENSURE MATERIAL </p><p>AND SPIRITUAL WELL BEING, REJECT INJUSTICE AND INSTITUTIONAL </p><p>CORRUPTION, PROTECT HUMAN FREEDOM AND RIGHTS, AND ENGAGE IN </p><p>PUBLIC SERVICE. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7.    WHILE MEDIA ARE LIKELY TO FOCUS ON THE "NO TO WAR" </p><p>PHRASE, THE POPE\'S DISCOURSE REMAINED BALANCED ON IRAQ AND </p><p>THE MIDDLE EAST, AND AVOIDED DIRECT CRITICISM OF THE U.S.  IN </p><p>FACT, HIS FOCUS ON RESPECT FOR INTERNATIONAL LAW, WHICH, ON </p><p>THE ONE HAND, SEEKS TO ENSURE THE U.S. ACTS WITHIN THE UN </p><p>FRAMEWORK, ALSO CLEARLY SUGGESTS THAT THE IRAQ\'S AND NORTH </p><p>KOREA\'S OF THE WORLD NEED TO FOLLOW RULES OF CONDUCT AND </p><p>ADHERE TO AGREEMENTS ALREADY SIGNED.  IN LIGHT OF OUR ONGOING </p><p>DIALOGUE WITH THE HOLY SEE ON AFRICAN FAMINE, WE WELCOMED THE </p><p>PONTIFF\'S REFERENCES TO FAMINE IN AFRICA, AND HIS OPENING THE </p><p>DOOR TO "KNOW HOW" IN RESPONDING TO DEVELOPMENT ISSUES.  HIS </p><p>BLAST AT CONTINUED VISA PROBLEMS FOR CATHOLIC PRIESTS IN </p><p>RUSSIA REFLECTS THE SERIOUSNESS WITH WHICH HE VIEWS THIS </p><p>PROBLEM, WHICH HE TERMED A "CRISIS" NOT IN KEEPING WITH </p><p>RUSSIA\'S DEMOCRATIC ASPIRATIONS. END COMMENT. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  00135  02 OF 02  140740Z </p><p> </p><p>NICHOLSON </p><p>SKODON </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> </p><p></p><p> 2003VATICA00135 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
