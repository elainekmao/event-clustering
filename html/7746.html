<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 000738 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS, S/CT; NSC FOR </p><p>E. MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:   DECL:  05-02-13 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, PINS, CE, NO, JA, KWMM </p><p>SUBJECT:  In possible sign of a thaw, Tigers meet with </p><p>Norwegian facilitators carrying messages from GSL </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  (A) Colombo-SA/INS 05/02/03 fax </p><p> </p><p>-      (B) Colombo-SA/INS 04/30/03 class e-mail </p><p>-      (C) FBIS Reston Va DTG 301441Z Apr 03 </p><p>-      (D) Colombo 728, and previous </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Lewis Amselem, Deputy Chief of </p><p>Mission.  Reasons 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  Norwegian facilitators met with the </p><p>Tigers on April 30.  The Norwegians were carrying </p><p>letters from the GSL in response to the Tigers\' recent </p><p>withdrawal from the peace talks and a key assistance </p><p>committee.  In other news, the peace track gets even </p><p>busier next week as top LTTE, Norwegian, and Japanese </p><p>officials visit Sri Lanka.  The fact that the April 30 </p><p>meeting took place is an indication that peace process </p><p>tensions may be receding a bit.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) MEETING IN THE WANNI:  In the first meeting of </p><p>its kind in some time, Norwegian Ambassador Hans </p><p>Brattskar and MFA envoy Jon Westborg met with Liberation </p><p>Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) Political Chief S.P. </p><p>Thamilchelvam on April 30.  (Note:  Westborg was </p><p>Norway\'s ambassador to Sri Lanka before Brattskar </p><p>recently took up the post.)  The meeting took place in </p><p>the LTTE-controlled Wanni region in northern Sri Lanka. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Tomas Stangeland, polchief at the Norwegian </p><p>embassy, told us that the meeting was held in a cordial </p><p>atmosphere.  He added that it was also "constructive." </p><p>He confirmed that the main purpose of the meeting was </p><p>for the Norwegians to provide the LTTE two letters from </p><p>the GSL (see Para 4-5 for more details re the letters). </p><p>Stangeland, who attended the meeting, added that the </p><p>Norwegian side had also discussed several problems </p><p>relating to the implementation of the February 2002 </p><p>ceasefire agreement.  (Note:  In addition to the meeting </p><p>in the Wanni, we have heard reports that Norwegian </p><p>special envoy Erik Solheim was planning to meet LTTE </p><p>chief spokesman Anton Balasingham in London soon.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) GSL LETTERS TO THE LTTE:  The first letter </p><p>provided by the Norwegian facilitators contained a </p><p>response by Prime Minister Wickremesinghe to the LTTE\'s </p><p>April 21 pullout from the peace talks.  (Note:  The text </p><p>of the PM\'s letter was sent to SA/INS in Ref B.)  The </p><p>PM\'s letter was conciliatory in tone, making several </p><p>specific points in response to Balasingham\'s earlier </p><p>letter pulling out of the negotiations.  The PM\'s main </p><p>points were:  that there had been substantial progress </p><p>in reducing tensions throughout the country with the </p><p>ceasefire holding for over a year; the LTTE\'s inability </p><p>to attend the Washington conference was due to U.S. law </p><p>and was not the fault of the GSL; and that there was no </p><p>intention to exclude the LTTE from future negotiations </p><p>concerning humanitarian and economic topics.  The PM </p><p>wound up his letter by urging Balasingham to "review </p><p>your present stance" and return to the peace </p><p>negotiations as soon as possible. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) The second letter provided by the Norwegians to </p><p>the LTTE was from GSL Peace Secretariat chief Bernard </p><p>Goonetilleke and focused on the LTTE\'s pullout from an </p><p>important humanitarian committee last week.  (Note: </p><p>Goonetilleke has been selected to be Sri Lanka\'s next </p><p>foreign secretary.)  Goonetilleke\'s letter, the text of </p><p>which is contained in ref A, took a bit of a firmer tack </p><p>than the PM\'s in that it warned the group that further </p><p>postponement of peace negotiations could lead to a delay </p><p>in the disbursement of assistance-related funds. </p><p>Goonetilleke added that Subcommittee on Immediate </p><p>Humanitarian and Rehabilitation Needs (SIHRN) -- the </p><p>joint committee the LTTE had recently pulled out of -- </p><p>had actually done a lot of good work.  The GSL urged the </p><p>LTTE to make use of the committee if the group truly </p><p>wanted to provide assistance to displaced persons, and </p><p>create better economic conditions in the north and east. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) UPCOMING VISITS:  In other peace-related news, </p><p>the peace track heats up in the next week.  The </p><p>Norwegian embassy has confirmed that Balasingham will </p><p>arrive in country on May 5 and immediately transit to </p><p>the Wanni.  It is not clear how long Balasingham will </p><p>stay on this visit.  In the meantime, Norwegian Deputy </p><p>Foreign Minister Helgesen and Japanese Special Envoy </p><p>Akashi are also due to arrive in Sri Lanka for visits </p><p>focused on the peace process next week. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) COMMENT:  The fact that the April 30 meeting </p><p>took place is an indication that recent peace process </p><p>tensions may be receding a bit.  In past weeks, the </p><p>Tigers had issued a number of hard-line messages while </p><p>refusing to meet and discuss what was on their minds. </p><p>In light of that, the fact that the group is back </p><p>meeting with the Norwegians is constructive, perhaps </p><p>heralding new thinking on the group\'s part re their </p><p>decisions to pull out of the peace talks and the June </p><p>donors conference in Tokyo.  It is clear, however, that </p><p>getting the process back on track involves a delicate </p><p>tango, and, per the Tigers\' mood, there could easily be </p><p>setbacks.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
