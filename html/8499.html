(SBU) Summary: UNFPA, into the second year of its </p><p>four-year "special program" in Burma, is encouraged by its </p><p>successes.  To help ensure further progress, though, the </p><p>agency\'s Rangoon office hopes that a chronic shortage of </p><p>contraceptives will be remedied in short order.  The agency </p><p>plans to expand both the width and depth of its program in </p><p>the next two years, continuing to work with local and </p><p>international NGOs, other UN agencies, and the Burmese </p><p>government.  UNFPA\'s programs address serious health and </p><p>social needs in Burma, and thus expansion will benefit many </p><p>underserved women and adolescents.  However, we\'ll keep an </p><p>eye on two potential pitfalls of expansion: a deterioration </p><p>in monitoring, and an expansion in leakages.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>UNFPA Spreads its Wings in Burma </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) The UNFPA established itself well in the first year of </p><p>its program in Burma.  Though UNFPA has worked in Burma since </p><p>1969, it only established a country office in the summer of </p><p>2002.  UNFPA\'s representation in Burma was raised in 2003 </p><p>from chief of operations to representative level.  Currently </p><p>UNFPA is into the second year of its $16 million, four-year </p><p>program. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) UNFPA\'s programs in Burma address behavior change, </p><p>adolescent reproductive health, and general reproductive </p><p>health services.  It generally tries to build the capacity of </p><p>the decrepit rural healthcare network of health centers and </p><p>sub-centers by providing resources and training.  On the </p><p>population side, UNFPA continues its work analyzing the </p><p>numbers from a 2001 fertility and reproductive health survey </p><p>it carried out with the Burmese government.  UNFPA recently </p><p>took over the responsibility, normally held by UNICEF, to </p><p>provide drugs for people with sexually transmitted diseases. </p><p>The agency is also involved in HIV/AIDS education and </p><p>prevention as part of the UN country team\'s Expanded Theme </p><p>Group on HIV/AIDS, and is awaiting Ministry of Health </p><p>approval to begin its own HIV/AIDS programming -- centered on </p><p>education and "100 percent condom usage." </p><p> </p><p>Maternal Mortality is the Key Problem, Focus </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) There\'s no question that UNFPA\'s mission to address </p><p>maternal mortality tracks with the country\'s needs.  In 1997, </p><p>the maternal mortality rate in Burma was about 255 per </p><p>100,000 live births.  Raw statistics collected at the end of </p><p>2001 indicate that the rate has increased since then. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) There\'s also strong evidence of demand for UNFPA\'s </p><p>activities, both education and contraceptive supplies. UNFPA </p><p>estimates that only 29 percent of married women of </p><p>reproductive age use contraceptives.  In its operating area, </p><p>UNFPA is only able to supply 12-15 percent of likely clients. </p><p> Consequently, urban women avail themselves of a booming </p><p>black market for counterfeit, expired, or uncertified </p><p>contraceptive devices brought over from China.  In rural </p><p>areas, UN agencies, NGOs, and other commentators tell us, </p><p>women turn to illegal abortions as a contraceptive measure. </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) Additionally, UNFPA, along with various INGOs, helps </p><p>fills a niche for contraceptive choice.  Though the </p><p>government has focused on 100 percent condom distribution as </p><p>part of its HIV/AIDS program, there\'s not been much attention </p><p>on other modes of contraception. </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) Through its training programs, aimed at the vastly </p><p>female rural health corps and health statisticians, UNFPA </p><p>helps build capacity among female caregivers and </p><p>administrators. </p><p> </p><p>Relations with NGOs, Donors, and the Government </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) UNFPA carries out its work in conjunction with rural </p><p>government health workers, other UN agencies (especially the </p><p>WHO), international NGOs, and local government-controlled </p><p>NGOs (including the Myanmar Maternal and Child Welfare </p><p>Association and the Myanmar Medical Association).  UNFPA\'s </p><p>condom distribution is contracted to PSI, with which U.S. AID </p><p>works closely to implement its nascent $1 million HIV/AIDS </p><p>program in Burma.  Other partner INGOs include Marie Stopes </p><p>International, the International Planned Parenthood </p><p>Federation, and the Japanese Organization for International </p><p>Cooperation in Family Planning.  Save the Children and World </p><p>Vision also provide reproductive health services here, but </p><p>are not currently affiliated with UNFPA. </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) The INGOs with whom we spoke were generally positive </p><p>about UNFPA\'s operations here.  Some were a bit critical of </p><p>UNFPA\'s, and all UN agencies\', dealing with the regime and </p><p>government NGOs.  However, they admitted that the UN had </p><p>little choice but to work with the government to some degree, </p><p>and UNFPA was more vigilant than others in minimizing GOB </p><p>interference. </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) UNFPA\'s usual bilateral donors (the Netherlands and </p><p>the Scandinavian countries) are not active in reproductive </p><p>health in Burma, having put their limited Burma assistance </p><p>funds into the fight against HIV/AIDS.  However, the Japanese </p><p>government is doing some work on reproductive health.  UNFPA </p><p>receives some limited grassroots funding from the Japanese </p><p>Embassy in Rangoon for renovating rural health clinics.  We </p><p>were told that Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) </p><p>was planning a $2-$3 million multi-year program to provide </p><p>reproductive health alongside UNFPA in several dozen </p><p>townships. </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU) UNFPA\'s relations with its two government </p><p>interlocutors, the Ministry of Population and Immigration </p><p>(MOPI) and the Ministry of Health (MOH), are generally good. </p><p>UNFPA\'s representative reports that MOPI has been </p><p>surprisingly helpful and efficient in collaborating to </p><p>improve population statistics (there\'s been no official </p><p>census taken since the one UNFPA helped organize in 1983). </p><p>The Ministry of Health (MOH) has been somewhat more </p><p>bureaucratic and slow -- a complaint heard from many UN </p><p>agencies and health INGOs.  However, the UNFPA representative </p><p>reported that under the new Health Minister, Dr. Kyaw Myint, </p><p>cooperation and efficiency have increased.  For example, </p><p>Minister Kyaw Myint responded rapidly to UNFPA\'s request to </p><p>establish 20 new clinics/information centers/social halls </p><p>aimed at adolescents.  This proposal had languished for </p><p>months under the previous minister. </p><p> </p><p>12. (SBU) Though UNFPA does not channel its funds through the </p><p>MOH or other government ministries, it does work directly </p><p>with local health officials and government-run clinics.  It </p><p>also relies on the MOH\'s central distribution network to get </p><p>contraceptive devices sent to the various townships.  The </p><p>UNFPA representative complained that this distribution </p><p>network is slow and inefficient, but that there is no other </p><p>alternative if the GOB is to allow UNFPA to continue its </p><p>operations. </p><p> </p><p>Future Plans are Ambitious </p><p> </p><p>13. (SBU) Aside from the hoped-for HIV/AIDS program, UNFPA </p><p>intends to expand its capacity-building work.  The Rangoon </p><p>office intends to bring in consultants in 2003 to conduct a </p><p>thorough gender analysis.  In part, the impetus for this </p><p>study is the evolving economic role for women in Burma, as </p><p>more and more men seek economic opportunities outside the </p><p>country.  Following up this study, UNFPA, alongside the </p><p>Myanmar National Working Committee for Women\'s Affairs, plans </p><p>to do several workshops on gender issues and trafficking in </p><p>persons aimed at male policymakers at all levels of </p><p>government. </p><p> </p><p>14. (SBU) Though it is limited by its MOU with the government </p><p>to reproductive health, UNFPA is also examining a pilot </p><p>project to work with the UN Interagency Project to Combat </p><p>Human Trafficking in the Mekong Sub-Region\'s (UNIAP) </p><p>expanding Burma operations.  Specifically, UNFPA is looking </p><p>to assist a small, local development group (headed by </p><p>Catholic and Buddhist nuns) in Mon State to provide small </p><p>loans and other assistance to women and girls who might </p><p>otherwise seek a more dangerous living over the border in </p><p>Thailand. </p><p>Problems and Obstacles Remain </p><p> </p><p>15. (SBU) UNFPA\'s small operation in Burma allows it to exist </p><p>with fewer obstacles than other, larger UN agencies. </p><p>However, there are three issues worth watching.  First, a </p><p>major problem faced by UNFPA in Burma is a lack of funding </p><p>for contraceptive supplies.  Though condoms are not a </p><p>problem, procurement of contraceptive pills, injections, </p><p>IUDs, and the "morning after" pill has been inadequate.  The </p><p>representative said that UNFPA\'s procurement for Burma is </p><p>$800,000 in the hole for 2003, in large part due to a drop </p><p>off of bilateral donations and a general reduction of UNFPA\'s </p><p>funding around the world. </p><p>16. (SBU) Exacerbating this problem is leakage and government </p><p>misuse of what contraceptive supplies UNFPA can bring into </p><p>the country.  That being said, at this point leakage of </p><p>contraceptives for resale into the black market is not as </p><p>large a problem as it is for drugs and other high-value </p><p>items.  There are allegations that the government hijacks </p><p>some supplies of condoms, in particular, for their own use, </p><p>or for "donation" to a government-controlled NGO.  However, </p><p>the seriousness of this problem is unclear. </p><p> </p><p>17. (SBU) Monitoring, always a difficult task in Burma, is </p><p>easier for UNFPA because of the small size of its program. </p><p>Currently the agency is operating in 84 townships (about 25 </p><p>percent of the country\'s total), mostly in more heavily </p><p>populated rural areas that have better transportation </p><p>infrastructure.  Thus it is easier for UNFPA staff to make </p><p>regular monitoring missions.  The representative said that he </p><p>or his staff are making about four monitoring trips per month </p><p>to various program sites.  However, UNFPA aims to expand to </p><p>100 townships by 2005, which could put a strain on monitoring </p><p>effectiveness without additional hiring. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
