<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 001192 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>OFFICIAL INFORMAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FOR KFITZGIBBON </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/22/2006 </p><p>TAGS: PINS, PGOV, PHUM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: POTENTIAL FOR VIOLENCE IN KANO RISING </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) ABUJA B) ABUJA 0762 C) ABUJA 1644 D) ABUJA 1635 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by DCM Tim Andrews for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> 1. (U)  Summary:  In a series of meetings held in Kano May </p><p>10-12, Government officials, religious leaders, academics and </p><p>journalists repeatedly stressed to Poloff the "dangerous" </p><p>level of tension between Kano\'s Hausa-Fulani and large </p><p>immigrant Igbo and Yoruba population.  Communal relations </p><p>there appear to have deteriorated since the Ambassador\'s </p><p>visit in March, largely because of the continued perception </p><p>among Kano\'s Hausa majority that Lagos State Government is </p><p>unwilling to prosecute OPC members responsible for the </p><p>killing of Hausas in the Ajegunle incident last October (Ref. </p><p>C).  The activities of Shari\'a vigilante groups have also </p><p>increased apprehension among </p><p>Southerners.  Leaders on all sides are concerned, and are </p><p>warning of the potential for a bloody inter-ethnic conflict </p><p>in the city if something is not done to lesson the tension. </p><p>The Obasanjo Administration\'s reluctance to go beyond </p><p>immediate intervention in times of crisis has not helped to </p><p>alleviate those concerns.  If the Lagos and Kano Governors do </p><p>not begin to coordinate their efforts, and take at least some </p><p>steps towards reconciliation, another round of violence may </p><p>be difficult to avoid.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>Storm Clouds </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  The Chairman of the Kano chapter of the Christian </p><p>Association of Nigeria, Reverend G.A. Ojo, is pastor of the </p><p>First Baptist Church, the largest Yoruba church in Kano. Ojo </p><p>said that his church was being reduced to an all-male </p><p>membership, as the Yoruba in Kano were sending their families </p><p>back South.  He said that tensions between Kano\'s Hausa </p><p>majority and its Southern population had risen </p><p>"significantly."  Ojo praised the efforts of Governor </p><p>Kwankwaso, the Emir of Kano, the police and Muslim religious </p><p>leaders for preventing reprisals by Kano\'s Hausa against </p><p>their Yoruba neighbors following the Ajegunle incident last </p><p>October, in which hundreds of Hausas--largely from Kano--were </p><p>killed in a Lagos suburb. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  Ojo said that Kano\'s long-resident Southern minority, </p><p>which numbers in the range of half a million people, was very </p><p>aware of the historical ebb and flow of inter-ethnic violence </p><p>in Kano.  That collective memory extends to the pogrom </p><p>against Igbos in Kano in 1966--itself a reaction to the coup </p><p>attempt in which mostly Igbo officers killed Northern Premier </p><p>Sir Ahmadu Bello, Premier Tafawa Balewa and other Nigerian </p><p>leaders.  By some estimates, up to 30,000 thousands Igbo and </p><p>Yoruba were thought to have been killed in that incident, </p><p>which was a major precipitating factor in the Biafran </p><p>secession.  Ojo commented that "everyone" was aware that </p><p>tensions were particularly high at the moment, and that any </p><p>of several incidents--in Kano or Lagos--could spark a major </p><p>episode of inter-ethnic violence.  Ojo added that the Igbos </p><p>in Sabon Gari were all armed, and implied that the Yorubas </p><p>were as well.  He said that a direct attack against Sabon </p><p>Gari--a densely-populated rectangular enclave approximately </p><p>2.5 by one kilometers--would be unlikely because it is </p><p>essentially an "armed camp."  Ojo predicted that the violence </p><p>would probably be focused on the substantial number of Igbo </p><p>and Yoruba living elsewhere in the city. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  Ojo asserted that while the Shari\'a issue in Kano did </p><p>not help matters, Christian leaders had confidence in the </p><p>Government\'s intentions not to allow Shari\'a to affect their </p><p>population.  Their primary concern, he said, was with crime </p><p>and mob violence.  He added that an action by Shari\'a </p><p>enforcers, for example, could provide an opportunity for </p><p>Kano\'s "Yandabas" (gangs of criminally inclined, unemployed </p><p>youth) to set off unrest in order to begin looting.  Ojo said </p><p>that Kano\'s Hausas were "furious" over the failure of Lagos </p><p>State to prosecute Frederic Fashehun (leader of the OPC) and </p><p>other OPC members for their perceived involvement in the </p><p>Ajegunle incident.  He complained bitterly about the actions </p><p>of the OPC in Lagos and Lagos State Governor Bola Tinubu: </p><p>"Either they do not know that what they do puts us at risk, </p><p>or they do not care.  But we have no control over them.  We </p><p>can only sit and wait." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>The National Police </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  Deputy Commissioner of Police, Emmanuel Ezozue, an </p><p>Igbo, confirmed that Kano\'s security situation had become </p><p>"dangerous."  He said that preventing reprisal violence after </p><p>Ajegunle was a significant accomplishment, but added that </p><p>anger in the Hausa community over that incident had not </p><p>dissipated in the intervening seven months.  If anything, he </p><p>said, it was increasing because of a perceived lack of </p><p>justice in Lagos and the severely depressed economy in Kano. </p><p>Ezozue said, "My own brother left Kano for Abuja.  It\'s just </p><p>too dangerous."  Asked whether Kano\'s police would be able to </p><p>stop the unrest feared by many, the Deputy Commissioner said </p><p>flatly, "No.  There are too many of them, and not enough </p><p>police." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>The Governor </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C)  Governor Kwankwaso discussed at length the recent </p><p>Hisbah enforcement action against hotels that continue to </p><p>serve alchohol in the State (Ref. A).  He said that while he </p><p>had arrested those involved in the burning of the Igbo-owned </p><p>Henzina Hotel, he could not try them at this point because of </p><p>the potential reaction by Shari\'a supporters.  Kwankwaso said </p><p>that Kano\'s Hausa majority, independent of the Shari\'a </p><p>question, continued to be outraged by the failure to </p><p>prosecute any of the organizers or perpetrators of the </p><p>violence in Ajegunle.  He was especially critical of Lagos </p><p>Governor Bola Tinubu: "The man should have kept Fashehun </p><p>under house arrest in his hotel, a house, anywhere, for six </p><p>months so people up here would calm down.  Letting him go </p><p>after one week did not help me manage the situation here." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C)  Kwankwaso said that he had requested but not received </p><p>any help from the Obasanjo Administration on how to handle </p><p>the increasingly precarious security situation in Kano.  In </p><p>the immediate aftermath of the Ajegunle violence, delegations </p><p>sent by the Federal Government fanned out across the </p><p>nation--including Kano--to preach peace and restraint. </p><p>Clearly frustrated with the lack of current support from </p><p>Abuja in addressing the causes of the violence, Kwankwaso </p><p>declaimed: "Kano is the most difficult city in Nigeria to </p><p>manage!  It is the second largest in the country, and most of </p><p>its people are poor, even by our standards.  Lagos has </p><p>bankers, lawyers, a middle class, in addition to its poor.  I </p><p>have a few rich Alhajis--the rest are nail clippers and </p><p>people selling sugar-cane on the streets."  Acknowledging the </p><p>economic roots of recurring unrest in Kano, Kwankwaso added, </p><p>"A hungry man is an angry man.  And many people in Kano are </p><p>hungry."  (Note: Violent crime in Lagos is much worse, viewed </p><p>in per capita terms, than Kano, so the Governor\'s assertion </p><p>is not entirely accurate.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C)  Kwankwaso re-iterated that many of Kano\'s poor Hausas </p><p>were focusing much of their anger on the perceived injustice </p><p>against their kinsmen in the Ajegunle incident and its </p><p>aftermath.  He said that immediate revenge would have </p><p>dissipated the collective anger generated by that incident. </p><p>Kwankwaso added that he had been only half successful in </p><p>preventing a recurrence of violence: while reprisals for </p><p>Ajegunle were averted, the anger it generated remains. </p><p>According to Kwankwaso, the desire for vengeance appeared to </p><p>be growing. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C)  Consul General Lagos has reported to us that the </p><p>commission convened to study the causes of the Ajegunle riots </p><p>is nearing the completion of its report.  It appears that the </p><p>Commission may adopt the conspiracy theory that the violence </p><p>was instigated by a prominent Northerner to de-stabilize the </p><p>country, and therefor conclude that the Hausas in the </p><p>Ajegunle market riot started the violence and essentially </p><p>provoked the conflict that led to their own deaths.  While it </p><p>is difficult to determine with absolute certainty all that </p><p>happened in Ajegunle, as far as Northerners are concerned, </p><p>the bare facts of the incident speak for themselves: a large </p><p>number of the non-indigene Hausa minority were killed by a </p><p>majority population of Southerners, which suggests the </p><p>simpler explanation of bitter, long-standing grievances </p><p>boiling over, as they often do in Nigeria, with the minority </p><p>ethnic group taking the lion\'s share of the casualties.  Not </p><p>surprisingly, Hausas and Yorubas have divergent perspectives </p><p>on those events, and on the Odu\'a Peoples\' Congress (OPC), </p><p>that are not easily reconciled.  The OPC appears to be viewed </p><p>by Lagos State government as a legitimate civilian cultural </p><p>and law enforcement organization, whose responses can be </p><p>sometimes excessive.  It is generally viewed in the North as </p><p>a criminal, para-military organization that enjoys the tacit </p><p>support of Governor Tinubu and his Attorney General, and took </p><p>the lead in the unrest that resulted in the deaths of </p><p>hundreds of Hausas. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C)  Acting in the ad-hoc manner of previous heads of </p><p>state, President Obasanjo is reluctant to address this </p><p>situation beyond traditional responses to immediate </p><p>violence--police and army repression.  He risks alienating </p><p>what Yoruba base he has if he aggressively pursues the OPC. </p><p>He is already viewed by much of the Northern leadership as </p><p>having "gone ethnic."  In the eyes of Northerners, neither </p><p>Minister of Justice Bola Ige nor Governor Tinubu appear </p><p>interested in prosecuting criminal acts by OPC members </p><p>either. Although there are many Northerners serving in the </p><p>Obasanjo Administration, including senior conservatives who </p><p>remain loyal to his government, many other Hausas believe </p><p>that President Obasanjo is representing Yoruba--rather than </p><p>national--interests.  Barring intervention by the Executive, </p><p>the problem is left to the Governors, the police, and--if </p><p>there is a truly serious outbreak of inter-communal </p><p>violence--the military to solve. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  Comment: Truth can remain highly elusive in any </p><p>discussion across ethnic lines about seminal historical </p><p>events in Nigeria.  Each of the three major ethnic groups </p><p>tailors--or invents--facts to support its own long-standing </p><p>story of victimization by the others, which usually and </p><p>conveniently elides over that group\'s role as victimizer. </p><p>These stories color even the most basic perceptions, and </p><p>provide the rationale for occasionally devastating violence </p><p>against members of the perceived "aggressor" ethnic group, </p><p>thereby creating new victims ad nauseam.  Rightly or wrongly, </p><p>Kano\'s Hausas believe that their people were victimized by </p><p>the OPC in Lagos, and that both the Lagos State and Federal </p><p>Governments have failed to arrest and to prosecute the </p><p>perpetrators.  By all accounts, due to poverty, prejudice, </p><p>familial ties and anger at perceived injustice, many Hausas </p><p>in Kano appear poised to seek vengeance against their Yoruba </p><p>neighbors with fairly slight provocation.  Once violence of </p><p>that nature commences, regardless of the justification, the </p><p>Igbos are usually also attacked.  This is partly because they </p><p>are Southerners, but primarily because their homes and </p><p>businesses are targets of opportunity for looting by </p><p>participants in the violence. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  Comment Continued.:  There has been limited contact </p><p>between Governors Tinubu and Kwankwaso, while the Mission </p><p>maintains close ties with both.  Encouraging co-operation on </p><p>calming ethnic tensions is one option for the USG to pursue. </p><p>At the least, Governor Tinubu should be made aware that </p><p>releasing an inflammatory report on the Ajegunle incident in </p><p>Lagos will not enhance the security of his ethnic kinsmen in </p><p>Kano, to say the least.  A visit to Kano by the Governor or </p><p>other Lagos officials to express regret for the loss of life </p><p>at Ajegunle--similar to Gov. Makarfis\' "tour" of the </p><p>East--might be helpful in defusing some of the tension. </p><p>USAID is currently planning conflict-resolution programs </p><p>which may be of use, if their resources could be partly spent </p><p>on a public education campaign via radio for the largely, </p><p>illiterate Northern population. We will continue to sound </p><p>opinion amongst Nigerian security personnel, including NSA </p><p>Aliyu Mohammed, to guage their own level of concern, and to </p><p>express our misgivings about the security situation in Kano. </p><p>End Comment. </p><p>Andrews </p><p></p></div>
