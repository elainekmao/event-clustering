Commentaries </p><p>view the clause as a kind of punishment for Turkey for </p><p>refusing full cooperation with the U.S. in the war with </p><p>Iraq.  Papers give extensive front-page coverage to the </p><p>journalists killed by U.S. tank fire in Baghdad on Tuesday, </p><p>describing the  attack as a `bloody warning\' to the press. </p><p>An Al-Jazeera manager said to "Zaman": `Whether intentional </p><p>or not, coalition forces have begun targeting press members. </p><p>You can imagine the threat Iraqi civilians are living </p><p>under.\'  Meanwhile, three Iraqi Embassy diplomats who were </p><p>declared persona non grata left Turkey on Tuesday. </p><p>Commenting on his visit to Damascus on Sunday, Foreign </p><p>Minister Gul said that beside Iran and Syria, Ankara intends </p><p>to hold consultations with Israel as well.  The Israeli </p><p>foreign minister will pay a visit to Ankara next week to </p><p>discuss the war and economic relations with Turkey. </p><p>Opposition CHP leader Baykal criticized the government for </p><p>seeking a rapprochement with Iran and Syria, and added that </p><p>such moves blocked possible cooperation with the U.S.  MFA </p><p>diplomats feel uneasy about the cancellation of Khalilzad\'s </p><p>scheduled visit to Ankara this week, Baykal said.  Pointing </p><p>to developments in Northern Iraq, Baykal claimed that the </p><p>U.S. has not fulfilled pledges made by Secretary Powell </p><p>during his visit to Ankara last week to prevent Kurdish </p><p>groups from entering Mosul and Kerkuk.  Meanwhile, survivors </p><p>of a massive 1999 earthquake in Izmit province lined up to </p><p>donate blood to Iraqis wounded in the war, pointing out that </p><p>Saddam Hussein donated $10 million worth of fuel after the </p><p>quake.  The fuel was used to build homes for earthquake </p><p>victims.  Turkey\'s Red Crescent (Kizilay) announced on </p><p>Tuesday that it would send water, food, and medicine to </p><p>Northern Iraq and Basra.  The Red Crescent said all expenses </p><p>would be met by the International Red Cross, papers report. </p><p>U.S., the Red Cross, and Red Crescent representatives held a </p><p>meeting at the MFA on Tuesday, and will soon sign a protocol </p><p>on humanitarian aid activities in the war zone.  On the </p><p>other hand, all Iraqi opposition groups will reportedly meet </p><p>in Nasirija in southern Iraq on Saturday. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION:  Restructuring Iraq </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Military victory and political defeat" </p><p>Hasan Cemal commented in mass appeal Milliyet (4/9): "It is </p><p>true that making peace can sometimes be harder than making </p><p>war.  There seems to be a difference of opinion between the </p><p>US and the UK regarding the possible role for the UN to play </p><p>in post-war Iraq.  On the other hand, Washington is also the </p><p>scene of a tiff between the Pentagon and the State </p><p>Department on the future of Iraq. . All of this clearly </p><p>indicates some different tendencies and approaches about how </p><p>to establish security and stability in Iraq.  We should not </p><p>ignore the legitimacy issue either.  The new Iraqi </p><p>administration will emerge from an occupation, and it </p><p>remains to be seen to what extent it will gain legitimacy in </p><p>the Arab world and the larger international community. . The </p><p>end of Saddam is clear and definite, but Iraq in the post- </p><p>Saddam era has uncertainties.  Let\'s hope that we do not see </p><p>chaos in Iraq, but rather a speedy normalization process in </p><p>the near future." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"End of military war, and the beginning of political war" </p><p>Murat Yetkin opined in the liberal-intellectual Radikal </p><p>(4/9): "The only way to achieve political victory in Iraq is </p><p>to establish an administration with the support of the </p><p>people instead of one imposed by foreign military powers. </p><p>Yet there is no indication that the former will happen </p><p>instead of the latter.  It is irrational to believe that a </p><p>former US army general or a former ambassador will be able </p><p>to establish a new administration in Iraq with popular </p><p>support.  It is also risky to appoint a local figure to head </p><p>an American-led administration.  There are names circulating </p><p>for the new administration, such as Ahmad Chalabi or Bahram </p><p>Salih, which are seen by the majority of Iraqis as either </p><p>`crooks\' or `traitors.\'  .If Washington wants to turn its </p><p>military victory into a political triumph, it must create a </p><p>synergy with the UN system as well as regional countries and </p><p>the genuine representatives of Iraqi people." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
