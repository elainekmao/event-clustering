<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HALIFAX 0086 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR DS/IP/WHA, DS/DSS/ITA, DS/ICI/PII, DSERCC, WHA/EX </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ASEC, PREL, CA, US, Iraq </p><p>SUBJECT:  ANTI-WAR PROTESTS IN HALIFAX </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) AS REPORTED VIA E-MAILS OVER THE PAST WEEK, CONGEN </p><p>HALIFAX HAS BEEN THE SITE OF THREE MAJOR (BY ATLANTIC CANADA </p><p>STANDARDS) ANTI-WAR DEMONSTRATIONS SINCE THE COMMENCEMENT OF </p><p>HOSTILITIES IN IRAQ.  ALL THREE PROTESTS---ORGANIZED BY A </p><p>COMBINATION OF MILITANT STUDENT GROUPS, CHURCH GROUPS, AND THE </p><p>SELF-STYLED "HALIFAX PEACE COALITION"---TOOK THE FORM OF MARCHES </p><p>ACROSS TOWN, ENDING UP IN FRONT OF THE OFFICE BUILDING HOUSING </p><p>THE CONGEN.  ALL THREE TOOK PLACE WITHOUT VIOLENCE, ALTHOUGH </p><p>DEMONSTRATORS ENGAGED IN STRONG ANTI-U.S. RHETORIC AND BURNED </p><p>U.S. FLAGS ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) BOTH HALIFAX REGIONAL POLICE AND THE ROYAL CANADIAN </p><p>MOUNTED POLICE (RCMP) TRACKED THE DEMONSTRATIONS CAREFULLY AND </p><p>PROVIDED PROTECTION TO CONGEN OFFICES, PROVIDING 20-30 UNIFORMED </p><p>POLICE OFFERS AT EACH EVENT.  RCMP CONTACTS HAVE KEPT CG AND PSO </p><p>INFORMED IN DETAIL OF THESE AND OTHER PLANNED PROTEST </p><p>ACTIVITIES. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) THE FIRST DEMONSTRATION OCCURRED AT 1400 HOURS (LOCAL) </p><p>ON THURSDAY, MARCH 20.  APPROXIMATELY 100 PROTESTERS ARRIVED AT </p><p>THE FRONT ENTRANCE TO THE OFFICE BUILDING (PURDYQS TOWER II) IN </p><p>WHICH CONGEN HAS ITS NINTH-FLOOR OFFICES.  THE DEMONSTRATORS </p><p>CHANTED, PLAYED DRUMS, AND SOUNDED AIR HORNS FOR ABOUT 25 </p><p>MINUTES BEFORE DEPARTING.  THE PROTESTERS ALSO THREW BAGS OF </p><p>WATER-SOLUBLE PAINT AT THE FRONT ENTRANCE AREA AND DREW FIGURES </p><p>AND GRAFFITI ON THE STREET WITH CHALK.  BUILDING MAINTENANCE </p><p>QUICKLY CLEANED THE AREA. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) THE SECOND DEMONSTRATION OCCURRED LATER THE SAME DAY AT </p><p>1755 HOURS.  MORE THAN 600 PROTESTERS ARRIVED AS A GROUP AT THE </p><p>FRONT ENTRANCE TO PURDYQS TOWER II.  THE DEMONSTRATION LASTED </p><p>ABOUT ONE HOUR AND FEATURED SEVERAL SPEAKERS.  THE CROWD WAS </p><p>WELL BEHAVED AND DEPARTED AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE SPEECHES. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) THE THIRD DEMONSTRATION TOOK PLACE ON SATURDAY, MARCH </p><p>22.  PROTESTERS ARRIVED WITH POLICE ESCORT AT THE FRONT OF </p><p>PURDYQS TOWER II AT ABOUT 1400 HOURS.  PROTESTERS ORGANIZED BY </p><p>THE "HALIFAX PEACE COALITION" MARCHED ACROSS TOWN CARRYING IRAQI </p><p>FLAGS, ANTIWAR BANNERS, AND ANTI-U.S. PLACARDS.  SEVERAL </p><p>DEMONSTRATORS BURNED A LARGE U.S. FLAG WHEN THEY ARRIVED IN </p><p>FRONT OF THE CONSULATE.  STUDENT LEADERS, CHURCH LEADERS, AND </p><p>MEMBERS OF THE MUSLIM COMMUNITY DELIVERED SPEECHES AND CHANTING </p><p>SLOGANS EXCORIATING THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, IN SOME CASES USING </p><p>FAIRLY VIRULENT LANGUAGE.  SEVERAL TV NEWS CREWS COVERED THE </p><p>EVENT.   MEDIA REPORTS DESCRIBED THE CROWD AS NUMBERING BETWEEN </p><p>1,000-2,000, BUT WE CONSERVATIVELY ESTIMATE THE TOTAL NUMBER AT </p><p>CLOSER TO 600-800. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) INDICATIONS OF A MAJOR ANTI-U.S. PROTEST AT THE CG </p><p>RESIDENCE FORCED CONGEN HALIFAX TO CANCEL A LARGE RECEPTION WE </p><p>WERE SCHEDULED TO HOLD THERE ON MARCH 25.  POLICE AND UNIVERSITY </p><p>OFFICIALS WARNED US THAT THEY HAD RECEIVED CLEAR INDICATIONS </p><p>THAT STUDENT GROUPS WERE ORGANIZING THEMSELVES TO CONDUCT A </p><p>MAJOR PROTEST AT THE CG RESIDENCE TO DISRUPT OUR RECEPTION. </p><p>SOME OF THE 30 LOCAL ART STUDENTS WHO WERE TO ATTEND THE </p><p>RECEPTION AS GUESTS OF HONOR HAD BEEN THREATENED AND PRESSURED </p><p>TO BOYCOTT THE RESIDENCE.  ON THE ADVICE OF THE RCMP, WE </p><p>POSTPONED THE EVENT. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) THESE DEMONSTRATIONS ARE SMALL COMPARED TO THOSE THAT </p><p>HAVE TAKEN PLACE IN LARGER CANADIAN CITIES SUCH AS TORONTO OR </p><p>MONTREAL, BUT SIGNIFICANT BY HALIFAX STANDARDS.  AS IS USUALLY </p><p>THE CASE IN THE MARITIMES, THE PROTESTORS ARE CONDUCTING </p><p>THEMSELVES IN A RESTRAINED, MOSTLY NON-VIOLENT MANNER.  THE FACT </p><p>THAT CONGEN HALIFAX IS LOCATED IN A LARGE OFFICE BUILDING </p><p>(CLOSED TO THE PUBLIC ON WEEKENDS) WHICH ALSO HOUSES DOZENS OF </p><p>OTHER COMPANIES TENDS TO UNDERCUT ANY DANGER OF DIRECT ACTION </p><p>AGAINST OUR OFFICES. WE UNDERSTAND THAT MILITANT STUDENT GROUPS </p><p>AND THE "HALIFAX PEACE COALITION" INTEND TO ORGANIZE PROTESTS </p><p>EVERY SATURDAY AFTERNOON IN FRONT OF THE OFFICE BUILDING HOUSING </p><p>THE CONGEN. </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) WE ARE COORDINATING CLOSELY WITH THE RCMP, THE HALIFAX </p><p>REGIONAL POLICE, AND OUR OWN BUILDING SECURITY PEOPLE TO </p><p>MINIMIZE ANY RISK.  PSO HAS REVIEWED PROCEDURES WITH THE LOCAL </p><p>CONTRACT GUARD TO CONTROL ACCESS TO THE ENTRANCE OF THE </p><p>CONSULATEQS OFFICE SPACE.  NO PROTESTERS HAVE TARGETED THE CG </p><p>RESIDENCE AS OF YET, BUT RCMP CONTACTS HAVE CONFIRMED THAT THE </p><p>LOCATION OF THE RESIDENCE IS KNOWN TO LOCAL ANTI-WAR ACTIVISTS. </p><p>KASHKETT </p><p></p></div>
