<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 002254 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SECSTATE WASHDC FOR EB/ESC/ESP </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/REIDEL </p><p>TREASURY FOR OFAC DIRECTOR/RNEWCOMB AND TREASURY TASK FORCE </p><p>ON TERRORIST FINANCING </p><p>JUSTICE FOR OFFICE OF THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL/DLAUFMAN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/22/2012 </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, ELAB, NP, PTER, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL: FUNDING TERRORISM, MAOISTS TAP OVERSEAS </p><p>REMITTANCES </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Michael E. Malinowski for 1.5(b & d). </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (S) According to a prominent Kathmandu banker and </p><p>long-time Embassy contact, Maoists are tapping into </p><p>remittances from Nepalese employed abroad. Maoist tactics </p><p>include extorting remittances from family members, recruiting </p><p>members working abroad to send funds to their revolutionary </p><p>cause, and serving as moneylender to finance the initial </p><p>costs of foreign employment. Sources estimate that Maoists </p><p>take at least $500,000 USD per month from Malaysia, Saudi </p><p>Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, and, perhaps </p><p>other countries with significant numbers of Nepalese </p><p>expatriate workers. </p><p> </p><p>Maoists Prey on Expatriate Labor </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) According to Prithivi Pande (PROTECT), Chief Executive </p><p>Director of Nepal Investment Bank LTD, Maoists are tapping </p><p>into remittances from Nepalese employed abroad. In an </p><p>interview with EconOff, Mr. Pande described the bank\'s </p><p>efforts to garner a portion of the remittance payment market </p><p>by providing services for the transfer of funds and financing </p><p>the initial costs of foreign employment. The global war on </p><p>terrorism has disrupted parts of the hundi and hawala fund </p><p>transfer system and opened the remittance services market to </p><p>established financial institutions. It was through Nepal </p><p>Investment Bank\'s marketing efforts that the bankers became </p><p>aware of Maoist access to remittances. </p><p> </p><p>Tactics in Nepal </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) Manpower agencies working in Malaysia told Pande that </p><p>the Maoists provide financing to foreign employees to cover </p><p>the initial expenses for foreign employment. An employee\'s </p><p>expenses include round-trip airfare, visa fees, and manpower </p><p>agency fees averaging $1,285 USD (100,000 Nepali Rupees) for </p><p>work in Malaysia and the Gulf. Desperate laborers </p><p>traditionally borrowed from local moneylenders at rates of </p><p>30-35 percent, which were repaid by family members receiving </p><p>the remittance. The sources were unable to estimate the </p><p>extent of the problem but added that families receiving </p><p>remittances from abroad are targets for Maoist revenue </p><p>collection. (Comment: The Nepali press has reported this as </p><p>well.) </p><p> </p><p>Tactics Abroad </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (S) While marketing services in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and </p><p>the United Arab Emirates, Rajesh Khanal (PROTECT), </p><p>Relationship Manager for the Bank, heard from Nepalese </p><p>manpower companies that Maoists were soliciting funds and </p><p>recruiting members for their revolutionary cause. Mr. Khanal </p><p>traveled to the Saudi city of Dammam (4-5 hours from Riyadh) </p><p>on November 8 to gather in a city square with other </p><p>Nepalese--a Nepalese expatriate tradition that takes place </p><p>every Friday. While in the public square, he witnessed </p><p>Maoists openly recruiting members and soliciting funds in </p><p>Nepali. </p><p> </p><p>5. (S) The manpower agencies in contact with the Nepal </p><p>Investment Bank believe up that to 20 percent of expatriate </p><p>Nepalese in the Gulf remit funds to the Maoists directly. The </p><p>bankers estimate that nearly 200,000 Nepalis work in Saudi </p><p>Arabia and are able to return $100 USD per month after </p><p>expenses. If extrapolated to the entire community of 300,000 </p><p>Nepalese believed to work in the Gulf, the bankers estimate </p><p>Maoists could receive at least $500,000 USD per month in </p><p>direct funding. (Comment: All figures provided are soft and </p><p>based on anectdotal evidence. However, should the upper </p><p>estimates of Maoist infiltration, numbers of Nepalese present </p><p>in the region, and estimates of monthly per capita </p><p>remittances prove valid; the Maoists could net USD $6 million </p><p>per month.) </p><p> </p><p>6. (S) EconOff will conduct follow-on interviews with </p><p>Nepalese manpower agencies to confirm the banker\'s reports, </p><p>try to determine the extent of Maoist penetration, and </p><p>identify financial links for asset freeze. The Embassy would </p><p>welcome any insights into these terrorist funding networks </p><p>that addressee posts may be able to provide. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
