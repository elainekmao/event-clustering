<p>S E C R E T ROME 002791 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>THE HAGUE FOR CWC DEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/19/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PARM, IT, CWC </p><p>SUBJECT: ITALY CONCERNED ABOUT ALBANIAN CHEMICAL WEAPONS </p><p> </p><p>REF: SECSTATE 163256 </p><p> </p><p>    CLASSIFIED BY: POLITICAL-MINISTER COUNSELOR TOM COUNTRYMAN FOR REASONS </p><p>1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p> 1.  (C) POLMIL OFFICER ON JUNE 18 CONVEYED REFTEL POINTS TO </p><p>GIOVANNI IANNUZZI, DIRECTOR OF THE MFA\'S OFFICE FOR </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION OF INTERNATIONAL DISARMAMENT AGREEMENTS.  NBC </p><p>EXPERT GENERAL GIANFRANCO TRACCI ALSO PARTICIPATED IN THE </p><p>PURSUANT DISCUSSION. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S) IANNUZZI WAS PLEASED THAT THE U.S. INTENT IS TO MOVE </p><p>TO STRENGTHEN THE PHYSICAL SECURITY AT ALBANIA\'S DECLARED </p><p>CHEMICAL WEAPONS STORAGE SITE -- PARTICULARLY GIVEN ITS </p><p>PROXIMITY TO ITALIAN TERRITORY. IANNUZZI SAID REFTEL POINTS </p><p>GAVE HIM THE SENSE THAT ITALY AND THE USG WERE IN GENERAL </p><p>AGREEMENT ON AN APPROACH.  HOWEVER, HE WAS NOT READY TO RULE </p><p>OUT AN INTERNATIONAL EFFORT.  "WE ARE NOT, IN PRINCIPLE, </p><p>OPPOSED TO IT," IANNUZZI SAID, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE "THE </p><p>PARAMETERS OF THE PROBLEM ARE NOT COMPLETELY CLEAR."  HE </p><p>ARGUED THAT IT WAS THEORETICALLY POSSIBLE TO USE THE G-8 </p><p>GLOBAL PARTNERSHIP AS A MECHANISM FOR MANAGING THE COSTS </p><p>ASSOCIATED WITH DESTRUCTION OF THE BLISTER AGENT, BUT MADE </p><p>CLEAR HE WAS NOT PROMOTING IT AS A SOLUTION.   IANNUZZI </p><p>APPRECIATED USG OPENNESS TO ENGAGING IN FURTHER EXPERT-LEVEL </p><p>DISCUSSIONS AT THE JUNE 24-27 EXECUTIVE COUNCIL MEETINGS IN </p><p>THE HAGUE, WHICH HE MAY ATTEND. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S) AS FOR ITALIAN ASSISTANCE, THE GOI APPROACHED ALBANIA </p><p>A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO AND IS STILL WAITING FOR AN OFFICIAL </p><p>RESPONSE.  ITALY IS PERPLEXED AS IT HAS NOTED SOME RESISTANCE </p><p>ON THE PART OF ALBANIA IN COMING COMPLETELY CLEAN ABOUT THE </p><p>AGENT STORED AT THE SITE. IANNUZZI ADMITTED THAT THE GOI WAS </p><p>    RATHER EMBARRASSED BY THE GOA\'S BEHAVIOR GIVEN ITALY\'S ROLE </p><p>IN NURTURING ALBANIA, AND THE FACT THAT ITALY HAS KNOWN FOR </p><p>YEARS THAT THE ALBANIANS WERE IN POSSESSION OF CHEMICAL </p><p>WEAPONS AGENTS.  IN EARLY JUNE, ROME SENT INSTRUCTIONS TO THE </p><p>ITALIAN AMBASSADOR IN TIRANA TO SEEK ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATION </p><p>ON ALBANIA\'S CWC DECLARATION.  AMBASSADOR IANNUCCI </p><p>SUBSEQUENTLY ENGAGED THE GOA, BUT IANNUZZI JUDGED THAT THE </p><p>RESPONSE HE RECEIVED WAS NOT SATISFACTORILY CONCRETE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S) IANNUZZI EMPHASIZED THAT ITALY IS VERY CONCERNED </p><p>ABOUT THE SAFETY OF ITS MILITARY PERSONNEL STATIONED IN THE </p><p>VICINITY OF THE STORAGE SITE.  HE FEARED THAT THERE COULD BE </p><p>MORE AGENT THAN THAT ALREADY KNOWN TO EXIST.  MANAGING THE </p><p>MATTER CORRECTLY AND EFFICIENTLY IS MADE ALL THE MORE URGENT </p><p>BY THE FACT THAT TIRANA DOES NOT EXERT FULL CONTROL OVER </p><p>ALBANIAN TERRITORY.  ITALY RECOGNIZES THAT SWITZERLAND HAS </p><p>HANDS-ON EXPERIENCE WORKING IN ALBANIA ON CW DESTRUCTION, AND </p><p>HAS DISCUSSED THE GENERAL NATURE OF THE CURRENT PROBLEM WITH </p><p>THE SWISS IN THE HAGUE.  IANNUZZI ACKNOWLEDGED, IF SOMEWHAT </p><p>RELUCTANTLY, THAT BERN HAS THE STATUS OF A PRIVILEGED </p><p>INTERLOCUTOR WITH TIRANA ON CHEMICAL WEAPONS.  THE KEY FOR </p><p>ITALY IS THE SAFETY OF ITS MILITARY FORCES AND DESTRUCTION OF </p><p>THE AGENT UNDER INTERNATIONAL SUPERVISION. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (S) GENERAL TRACCI CONCLUDED BY SPECULATING THAT CHINA </p><p>MAY HAVE SOLD THE AGENT TO ALBANIA, ARGUING THAT IT WOULD BE </p><p>IMPORTANT FOR STATE PARTIES TO THE CWC TO ADDRESS THIS HEAD </p><p>ON IF EVIDENCE OF A BEIJING-TIRANA CONNECTION EMERGES. </p><p>IANNUZZI, WHILE COMPLIMENTING TRACCI FOR HIS NBC EXPERTISE, </p><p>DID NOT COMMENT DIRECTLY ON THE GENERAL\'S POINT. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p></p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p>	2003ROME02791 - Classification: SECRET </p><p></p><p></p></div>
