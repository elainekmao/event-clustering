(C)  SUMMARY.  PRESIDENT MUGABE RECENTLY HAS </p><p>MET WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF THE COMMERCIAL </p><p>FARMERS UNION (CFU) AND THE WAR VETERANS </p><p>ASSOCIATION THAT IS SPEARHEADING THE OCCUPATIONS </p><p>OF FARMS, BOTH SEPARATELY AND TOGETHER.  AS OF </p><p>APRIL 20 IN HARARE, THE GENERAL SENSE IS THAT THE </p><p>MEETINGS HAVE SOMEWHAT LESSENED THE TENSIONS IN </p><p>AT LEAST SOME RURAL AREAS.  AMBASSADOR MCDONALD </p><p>ALSO HAS HAD SEPARATE MEETINGS WITH CFU </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES, AN INDEPENDENT MEDIATOR WHO </p><p>PARTICIPATED IN THE RECENT STATEHOUSE MEETINGS, </p><p>AND THE NIGERIAN HIGH COMMISSIONER, WHO PROVIDED </p><p>US A LIMITED READOUT ON THE VISIT HERE OF THE </p><p>NIGERIAN FOREIGN MINISTER.  WE SEE A WILLINGNESS </p><p>TO TALK AND EVEN SOME OPENNESS TO COMPROMISE, BUT </p><p>WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT THE FARM OCCUPATIONS ARE A </p><p>MEANS FOR MUGABE TO EXERCISE POLITICAL POWER, NOT </p><p>AN END IN THEMSELVES.  WE ARE SKEPTICAL THAT THE </p><p>FARM INVASIONS WILL CEASE BEFORE ELECTIONS ARE </p><p>HELD.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  IN A SERIES OF WELL-PUBLICIZED MEETINGS, </p><p>PRESIDENT MUGABE HAS MET SERIALLY WITH </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES OF THE COMMERCIAL FARMERS WHO </p><p>HAVE SEEN MANY OF THEIR MEMBERS\' PROPERTIES </p><p>OVERRUN BY SQUATTERS, LEADERS OF THE WAR VETERANS </p><p>ASSOCIATION WHO HAVE LED THE INCURSIONS, AND THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02197  01 OF 04  201632Z </p><p>TWO GROUPS TOGETHER.  AFTER THEIR JOINT MEETING </p><p>LAST NIGHT, I.T APPEARS THAT THE PROTAGONISTS WILL </p><p>CONTINUE TO TALK AND MAY WORK TOWARD A SOLUTION, </p><p>EVEN THOUGH THE OCCUPIERS WILL REMAIN ON THE </p><p>FARMS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.  IT APPEARS FOR </p><p>THE MOMENT THAT THE MEETINGS MAY HAVE ABATED THE </p><p>VIOLENCE THAT CLAIMED THE LIVES OF TWO FARMERS </p><p>THIS WEEK. </p><p> </p><p>MEETING THE FARMERS </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) OUR SERIES OF MEETINGS BEGAN ON APRIL 19, </p><p>WHEN TIM HENWOOD, LEADER OF THE COMMERCIAL </p><p>FARMERS UNION (CFU), AND THE CFU REGIONAL VICE </p><p>PRESIDENT, WILLIAM HUGHES (PLEASE PROTECT BOTH), </p><p>MET WITH THE AMBASSADOR AT THE EMBASSY.  TDY </p><p>POLOFF AND ECONOFF ALSO ATTENDED.  THE DISCUSSION </p><p>CENTERED AROUND THE MEETING THE CFU </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES HAD WITH PRESIDENT MUGABE ON </p><p>APRIL 17 AND THE CONDITIONS FARMERS ACROSS THE </p><p>NATION ARE FACING IN THE WAKE OF THE ONGOING FARM </p><p>INVASIONS AND RECENT KILLINGS OF TWO FARMERS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) HENWOOD SAID THE MEETING WITH MUGABE HAD </p><p>BEEN FRANK, AND HE FELT SOME PROGRESS HAD BEEN </p><p>MADE.  HE ALSO WAS REALISTIC ABOUT THE DIFFICULTY </p><p>OF READING MUGABE\'S INTENTIONS AFTER MEETING HIM, </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGING THAT MERE WORDS FROM MUGABE NEED TO </p><p>BE BACKER BY ACTIONS BEFORE AN INTERLOCUTOR CAN </p><p>BE SURE MUGABE IS ON COURSE. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02197  01 OF 04  201632Z </p><p>5.  (C)  HENWOOD CONFIRMED TO US THAT MANY </p><p>FARMERS HAVE LEFT THEIR FARMS, AND MORE ARE IN </p><p>THE PROCESS OF DOING SO.  HE DID NOT GIVE </p><p>NUMBERS, BUT IMPLIED THAT THE NUMBERS WERE </p><p>SUBSTANTIAL, ESPECIALLY IN THE AREAS WHERE </p><p>KILLINGS HAVE TAKEN PLACE OR OTHER VIOLENCE HAS </p><p>FLARED.  HE ALSO SAID THAT THERE ARE AREAS OF THE </p><p>COUNTRY IN  WHICH THERE HAVE BEEN NO INVASIONS </p><p>AND THINGS ARE GENERALLY PEACEFUL.  WHEN ASKED, </p><p>HE SAID ABOUT 40 OR 50 FARMERS HAVE SIGNED </p><p>DOCUMENTS AT THE DEMAND OF THE OCCUPIERS THAT </p><p>SUPPOSEDLY TRANSFER THE OWNERSHIP OF THE FARMLAND </p><p>TO THE OCCUPIERS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  MUCH OF THE USEFUL INFORMATION HENWOOD </p><p>CONVEYED WAS ABOUT THE NATURE AND SCOPE OF THE </p><p>FARM INVASIONS. </p><p> </p><p>  IT APPEARED TO HIM THAT THE AREAS SUFFERING </p><p>FROM INVASIONS WERE WHERE SIGNIFICANT ACTIONS HAD </p><p>TAKEN PLACE DURING ZIMBABWE\'S WAR OF LIBERATION. </p><p>OFTEN THE WAR VETERANS WERE RETURNING TO THEIR </p><p>FORMER AREAS OF OPERATION. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ8718 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  02197  02 OF 04  201632Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DODE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00 </p><p>      EUR-01   VC-01    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   L-00     AC-01 </p><p>      NSAE-00  OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00 </p><p>      P-00     SP-00    TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02 </p><p>      G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /008W </p><p>                  ------------------4E44AA  201639Z /38 </p><p>R 201636Z APR 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 5806 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC </p><p>USLO ABUJA </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 04 HARARE 002197 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>PARIS PLEASE PASS TO A/S SUSAN E. RICE </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR AF PDAS POWELL, AF DAS SCHNEIDMAN, </p><p>AF/S DIRECTOR RENDER, AF/S DESK OFFICER GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 4/20/10 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, ZI </p><p> </p><p>SUBJECT: MUGABE MEETS PROTAGONISTS IN ATTEMPT TO </p><p>CONTROL FARM CRISIS </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  02197  02 OF 04  201632Z </p><p>  DEATH THREATS TO FARMERS WERE WIDESPREAD. </p><p> </p><p>THESE WERE WHAT HAD LED TO MANY OF THE FARM </p><p>EVACUATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>  THERE HAD BEEN SOME BURNING OF FARMHOUSES AND </p><p>OUTBUILDINGS, INCLUDING AT LEAST ONE FULL TOBACCO </p><p>STORAGE SHED NEAR HARARE THAT HAD DESTROYED THAT </p><p>FARMER\'S HARVEST OF TOBACCO. </p><p> </p><p>  MOST OF THE OCCUPIED FARMS ARE BEING HELD BY </p><p>ONLY A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE.  A SMALL NUMBER OF </p><p>FARMS HAVE LARGE NUMBERS OF OCCUPIERS. </p><p> </p><p>  THE OCCUPIERS ARE NOT GENERALLY ARMED. </p><p> </p><p>  MANY FARM WORKERS--WHO ARE BLACKS--HAVE BEEN </p><p>BADLY BEATEN, A FACT NOT RECEIVING MUCH PRESS </p><p>ATTENTION.  HENWOOD SAID THE OCCUPIERS ON THE </p><p>FARM OF THE FIRST WHITE FARMER TO BE KILLED HAVE </p><p>SINCE RETURNED TO INTIMIDATE THE WORKERS THAT </p><p>REMAIN, AND HAVE BEEN WAVING BODY PARTS FROM ONE </p><p>OF THE FARM WORKERS THEY HAD EARLIER ABDUCTED. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  HENWOOD SAID THE KILLINGS OF THE TWO </p><p>FARMERS APPEAR QUITE DIFFERENT.  IN THE FLRST </p><p>DEATH, IT APPEARS THAT TEMPERS FLARED AND THINGS </p><p>GOT OUT OF CONTROL.  IN CONTRAST, HE SAID THE </p><p>SECOND KILLING LOOKED DELIBERATE AND WELL </p><p>PLANNED.  IN THAT CASE, THE FARM HAD NOT BEEN </p><p>OCCUPIED PRIOR TO THE KILLING, THE ATTACKERS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02197  02 OF 04  201632Z </p><p>ARRIVED EARLY IN THE MORNING IN A CONVOY AND </p><p>IMMEDIATELY OPENED FIRE WITH THE MANY GUNS THEY </p><p>HAD BROUGHT WITH THEM.  HE ALSO SAID THE </p><p>ATTACKERS DID NOT SPEAK NDEBELE, THE NATIVE </p><p>TONGUE IN THE REGION OF THE ATTACK. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  SOMEWHAT SURPRISINGLY, HENWOOD SAID THE </p><p>COOPERATION FROM HIGHER LEVEL ARMY AND POLICE </p><p>OFFICIALS HAD BEEN FAIRLY GOOD.  WHILE ORDINARY </p><p>POLICE ON THE SCENES OF THE ATTACKS HAD DONE </p><p>ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO PREVENT THEM--IN THE FIRST </p><p>KILLING THE VICTIM WAS REMOVED FROM A POLICE </p><p>STATION IN THE PRESENCE OF THE POLICE-SOME </p><p>SPECIAL UNITS THAT HAD BEEN DISPATCHED AT HIS </p><p>REQUEST BY GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS HAD COOPERATED. </p><p>THEY HAD, HOWEVER, ARRIVED FAR TOO LATE TO BE OF </p><p>ANY PRACTICAL USE. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  HENWOOD SAID THAT ALTHOUGH THE CFU WAS </p><p>DOING WHAT IT COULD TO PROTECT ITS MEMBERS, THEY </p><p>HAD COME TO FEEL THEY WERE A BIT PERIPHERAL TO </p><p>THE HEART OF THE PROCESS, WHICH WAS A POLITICAL </p><p>QUESTION.  IN SO MANY WORDS, HE SAID THE LAND </p><p>ISSUE WAS A POLITICAL FOOTBALL FOR MUGABE AND THE </p><p>WAR VETERANS.  THUS, THE CFU AND ITS MEMBERS FIND </p><p>THEMSELVES IN THE MIDDLE OF AN ISSUE THEY CAN </p><p>ULTIMATELY DO LITTLE TO AFFECT. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C)  HENWOOD ALSO PASSED ON SOME INFORMATION </p><p>THAT SOUNDED AS IF IT HAD PARTLY BEEN GLEANED </p><p>FROM SOURCES OF UNKNOWN CREDIBILITY AND PARTLY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02197  02 OF 04  201632Z </p><p>RESULTED FROM READINGS OF THE POLITICAL TEA </p><p>LEAVES.  FOR WHAT IT IS WORTH, HENWOOD SAID HE </p><p>THOUGHT THE CABINET HAD BEEN SPLIT ABOUT 50-50 </p><p>OVER THE LAND OCCUPATIONS WHEN THEY BEGAN, BUT </p><p>THAT NOW MUGABE WAS NEARLY THE LAST REMAINING </p><p>DEFENDER OF THEM.  HE THOUGHT THIS EXPLAINED THE </p><p>WIDE SPLIT BETWEEN VICE PRESIDENT MSIKA AND </p><p>PRESIDENT MUGABE OVER ENFORCING THE LATEST COURT </p><p>JUDGMENT ORDERING THE GOVERNMENT TO END THE </p><p>OCCUPATIONS.  HOWEVER, WE BELIEVE IT IS LIKELY </p><p>THAT MUGABE APPROVED MSIKA\'S STATEMENT AND THEN </p><p>CONTRADICTED HIM. </p><p> </p><p>MEETING THE MIDDLEMAN </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C)  LATER ON APRIL 19, WE MET WITH FATHER </p><p>FIDELIS, A CATHOLIC PRIEST WHO HAD ATTENDED THE </p><p>APRIL 17 MUGABE-CFU MEETING IN THE SOMEWHAT </p><p>HAZILY DEFINED ROLE OF MEDIATOR OR FACILITATOR. </p><p>HE IS WELL KNOWN TO THE EMBASSY AND WE HAVE A </p><p>POSITIVE VIEW OF HIM.  FR. FIDELIS AGREED WITH </p><p>HENWOOD THAT THE MEETING HAD BEEN RELAXED AND </p><p>FRANK.  IT WAS APPARENTLY A GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ8720 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  02197  03 OF 04  201632Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DODE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00 </p><p>      EUR-01   VC-01    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   L-00     AC-01 </p><p>      NSAE-00  OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00 </p><p>      P-00     SP-00    TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02 </p><p>      G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /008W </p><p>                  ------------------4E44BA  201639Z /38 </p><p>R 201636Z APR 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 5807 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC </p><p>USLO ABUJA </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 04 HARARE 002197 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>PARIS PLEASE PASS TO A/S SUSAN E.

FIDELIS HAD OF THE CFU </p><p>REACTION TO THE MEETING WITH THE REACTION THE CFU </p><p>HAD GIVEN DIRECTLY TO US, HOWEVER, WE ARE NOT </p><p>SURE THE SIDES WERE LISTENING AS WELL AS TALKING. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C)  FR. FIDELIS THOUGHT THE EXPLANATION </p><p>MUGABE HAD GIVEN TO THE FARMERS ABOUT THE ORIGINS </p><p>OF THE LAND PROBLEM IN THE BRITISH COLONIAL </p><p>PERIOD HAD PRODUCED REAL UNDERSTANDING ON THE </p><p>FARMERS\' PART OF MUGABE\'S MOTIVATION.  THE CFU </p><p>CHARACTERIZED THIS PART OF THEIR TALKS WITH </p><p>MUGABE AS A REPLAY OF A BROKEN RECORD.  FR. </p><p>FIDELIS ALSO CLAIMED THE CFU DELEGATION HAD TOLD </p><p>MUGABE THEY NOW REALIZE THE "NO" VOTE ON THE </p><p>RECENT CONSTITUTIONAL REFERENDUM HAD BEEN A </p><p>MISTAKE--SOMETHING WE FIND HARD TO BELIEVE. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C)  FR. FIDELIS WAS EVASIVE ON GIVING AN </p><p>OPINION ON SOME IMPORTANT ISSUES, SUCH AS WHERE </p><p>THE WAR VETERANS ARE GETTING THEIR VEHICLES AND </p><p>WEAPONS, BUT HE DID HAVE INTERESTING OBSERVATIONS </p><p>ON SOME OTHER ISSUES.  FOR EXAMPLE, HE HAS BEEN </p><p>DEALING WITH THE WAR VETS AND THE LAND TAKEOVER </p><p>ISSUE FOR SEVERAL YEARS BUT SAID IT WAS POINTLESS </p><p>TO TALK WITH THE VETERANS\' LEADER, "HITLER" </p><p>HUNZVI.  HE CHARACTERIZED HUNZVI AS "NOT A </p><p>SOLUTION MAN."  HE ALSO SAID THAT WHILE THERE </p><p>WERE SOME LOGICAL ANSWERS TO SOME OF THE VEXING </p><p>ISSUES IN THE CURRENT POLITICAL TANGLE, THEY WERE </p><p>OF LITTLE USE BECAUSE EMOTIONS HAVE COME TO THE </p><p>FORE. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02197  03 OF 04  201632Z </p><p> </p><p>THE NIGERIAN READOUT </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C)  ON APRIL 20 THE AMBASSADOR HAD AN </p><p>INITIAL MEETING WITH THE NEWLY ARRIVED NIGERIAN </p><p>HIGH COMMISSIONER, B.W. JUTA, THAT FOCUSED MAINLY </p><p>ON THE NIGERIAN VIEWS OF THE CURRENT POLITICAL </p><p>SITUATION AND THE JUST-CONCLUDED VISIT OF </p><p>NIGERIAN FOREIGN MINISTER LAMIDO TO PRESIDENT </p><p>MUGABE. </p><p> </p><p>15.  (C)  COMMISSIONER JUTA SAID PRESIDENT </p><p>OBASANJO HAD DECIDED TO SEND HIS FM AS SOON AS HE </p><p>HEARD OF THE DEATH OF THE FIRST WHITE FARMER, AND </p><p>THAT IT WAS THE VIOLENCE SURROUNDING THE LAND </p><p>ISSUE THAT MOST CONCERNED OBASANJO.  JUTA DID NOT </p><p>PROVIDE A DETAILED READOUT OF THE LAMIDO-MUGABE </p><p>MEETING, BUT SAID THE MOST IMPORTANT MESSAGE FROM </p><p>THE NIGERIAN SIDE WAS THEIR CONCERN OVER VIOLENCE </p><p>AND THE APPEARANCE THAT LAW AND ORDER WAS </p><p>BREAKING DOWN.  THE MESSAGE THEY TOOK FROM MUGABE </p><p>WAS THAT THE SITUATION WAS NOW UNDER CONTROL, HE </p><p>REGRETTED THE DEATHS, AND THAT HE WAS SENDING A </p><p>HIGH LEVEL DELEGATION TO THE APRIL 27 TALKS WITH </p><p>GREAT BRITAIN.  THE NIGERIANS APPEAR TO VIEW THE </p><p>DIRECT ZIMBABWE-BRITAIN TALKS AS AN IMPORTANT </p><p>OPPORTUNITY TO CALM THE SITUATION IN ZIMBABWE. </p><p> </p><p>16.  (C)  IN RESPONSE TO AMBASSADOR MCDONALD\'S </p><p>OBSERVATION THAT THE ROOTS OF THE CURRENT </p><p>PROBLEMS LAY IN THE POLITICS OF ZIMBABWE, AND </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02197  03 OF 04  201632Z </p><p>THAT THAT IS WHERE THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY </p><p>MUST HELP ZIMBABWEANS LOOK FOR SOLUTIONS, JUTA </p><p>DEMURRED.  HE SAID NIGERIA VIEWED ALL QUESTION OF </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN POLITICS AS AN INTERNAL MATTER, AND </p><p>THAT NIGERIA SOUGHT TO EXPRESS THEIR VIEWS ONLY </p><p>OVER THE LAND ISSUE, ESPECIALLY INSOFAR AS IT </p><p>COMBUSTS INTO VIOLENCE. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p> </p><p>17.  (C)  ZIMBABWE AT THE MOMENT IS A GOOD </p><p>EXAMPLE OF CHURCHILL\'S AXIOM THAT JAW-JAW IS </p><p>BETTER THAN WAR-WAR.  IT IS UNCLEAR WHAT, IF ANY, </p><p>REAL RESOLUTION TO THE LAND PROBLEM WILL COME </p><p>FROM TALKS BETWEEN THE WAR VETERANS, THE FARMERS, </p><p>AND PRESIDENT MUGABE.  HAVING FAILED IN THE </p><p>PREVIOUS TWENTY YEARS TO ARRIVE AT A LASTING </p><p>SOLUTION, IT IS UNLIKELY THEY WILL DO SO NOW. </p><p>INDEED, POLITICS SEEMS TO PREVAIL FOR NOW. </p><p>NONETHELESS, TALK IS PREFERABLE TO THE DEATHS, </p><p>INTIMIDATION, AND POPULATION FLIGHT THAT WE HAVE </p><p>SEEN IN RECENT DAYS. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ8722 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  02197  04 OF 04  201633Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DODE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00 </p><p>      EUR-01   VC-01    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   L-00     AC-01 </p><p>      DCP-01   NSAE-00  OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00 </p><p>      ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    IRM-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00 </p><p>      DSCC-00  DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /009W </p><p>                  ------------------4E44C0  201639Z /38 </p><p>R 201636Z APR 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 5808 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC </p><p>USLO ABUJA </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 04 OF 04 HARARE 002197 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>PARIS PLEASE PASS TO A/S SUSAN E.

WE BELIEVE OUR PROPOSED HIGH- </p><p>LEVEL APPROACH TO MUGABE (REFTEL), AIMED AT </p><p>MAKING HIM REALIZE HIS LEADERSHIP OBLIGATIONS AS </p><p>HEAD OF GOVERNMENT, IS CURRENTLY THE BEST MEANS </p><p>FOR US TO ASSIST IN ZIMBABWE.  WE ARE DEVELOPING </p><p>TALKING POINTS THAT CAN BE USED FOR THIS </p><p>INITIATIVE.  WE AGREE WITH THE THEME OF "HOW CAN </p><p>WE HELP."  IT IS CONCEIVABLE THAT THE FARMERS AND </p><p>MUGABE CAN FIND SOME ACCOMMODATION WITH ONE </p><p>ANOTHER, EVEN WHILE REMAINING DIVIDED ON </p><p>FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES OF HISTORICAL INJUSTICE AND </p><p>THE OBLIGATIONS PAST GENERATIONS CAN IMPOSE ON </p><p>THE PRESENT.  AFTER ALL, UNTIL THE RECENT SPATE </p><p>OF LAND OCCUPATIONS THEY APPEARED TO HAVE FOUND A </p><p>WORKABLE PROCESS THROUGH THE RESULTS OF THE LAND </p><p>CONFERENCE OF 1998.
