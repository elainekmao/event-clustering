<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 008975 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA CROCKER, NEA/NGA AND EUR/SE; </p><p>LONDON FOR KHALILZAD, PEARCE AND EGOLDRICH; </p><p>DAMASCUS FOR WALKER </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/13/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MARR, TU, IZ, Iraq </p><p>SUBJECT: NORTHERN IRAQ: TURKS TELL PUK ASSISTANCE AGAINST </p><p>ANSAR AL-ISLAM DEPENDS ON OUTCOME OF LONDON OPPOSITION </p><p>CONFERENCE, PLUS ITF INTRIGUES </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> (U) Classified by Charge d\'Affaires a.i. Robert Deutsch. </p><p>Reasons:  1.5 (B and D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>Turks Link Help vs. Ansar to Conference Outcome </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Operation Northern Watch POLAD met with Patriotic </p><p>Union of Kurdistan Ankara rep Bahros Galali December 13. </p><p>Galali said he had met earlier in the week with Turkish </p><p>military officials (NFI) who told him that if, in Turkey\'s </p><p>view, the London opposition conference had a positive result, </p><p>Turkey would do all it could to help the PUK, including in </p><p>the fight against Ansar al-Islam.  However, if Turkey was </p><p>unhappy with the outcome, Turkey would be unable to provide </p><p>the PUK with assistance.  The TGS officers told Galali that </p><p>the PUK should block the participation at the conference of </p><p>KDP-friendly Turkmen.  The PUK declined to do so. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>Rumors of Turkish Troops, Ammo to Border </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Galali told us he had information that the Turks were </p><p>moving troops, ammunition and food stocks to the Iraqi </p><p>border.  He had heard rumors from a number of sources that </p><p>Turkey was training three thousand soldiers to serve in an </p><p>"international police force" in Iraq, that the group included </p><p>Iraqi Turkmen, and that the plan was for these soldiers to </p><p>remain in northern Iraq indefinitely.  He said he feared </p><p>Turkey would "attack our area and take control of our region </p><p>until there is a new government in a stable Baghdad." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>ITF Office Run By Turkish Turks-Visa Scams </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Galali told us he had been informed by a friend in the </p><p>TGS that the Iraqi Turkmen Front (ITF) office in Zakho was </p><p>staffed by Turks, not by Iraqi Turkmen, and that he had been </p><p>advised that the Zakho ITF office would help him get PUK </p><p>people into Turkey for a USD 600/person fee.  Galali added </p><p>that this week, in his effort to get PUK delegates to London, </p><p>he had one politburo member who went to the Zahko ITF office </p><p>with his Iraqi passport, and was first told the passport was </p><p>invalid.  He got a new passport in Dohuk and was turned away </p><p>by the ITF office in Zakho again.  The third time he put USD </p><p>600 in his passport and received a Turkish visa. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>ITF Insisting on 20 Seats, Endorsement of Views </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. Finally, Galali said he ran into ITF Chairman Sanan Aga at </p><p>the Ankara airport earlier in the day.  Aga told Galali that </p><p>the ITF was bringing 20 delegates to the London opposition </p><p>conference, although the organizers had only offerd the ITF 8 </p><p>spots.  Aga said if the conference did not let all the ITF </p><p>delegates in, the ITF would walk out of the conference.  Aga </p><p>also told Galali that if the ITF did not get its positions </p><p>approved, it would not accept the results of the conference. </p><p>DEUTSCH </p><p></p></div>
