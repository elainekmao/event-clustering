Ashley Wills: </p><p>Reasons:  1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY:  We warmly welcome your upcoming visit. </p><p>It comes at an important time, with the peace process </p><p>facing serious turbulence.  After months of progress, </p><p>including six rounds of talks, the Tigers recently </p><p>suspended negotiations.  There have been tentative signs </p><p>that the Tigers\' may be edging away from their hard-line </p><p>stance, but the situation remains fluid.  The peace </p><p>process is also being buffeted by domestic problems, </p><p>such as cohabitation stresses and a delicate economic </p><p>situation.  Despite all the turbulence, this period </p><p>remains one of tremendous promise and your visit will </p><p>help cement the gains made in U.S.-Sri Lankan relations, </p><p>including in the defense area.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>=============================== </p><p>Background on the Peace Process </p><p>=============================== </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) We look forward to your May 11-14 visit to Sri </p><p>Lanka.  It comes at an important time.  As you know, the </p><p>United National Front (UNF) government led by Prime </p><p>Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe has taken an activist </p><p>posture regarding the peace process since it assumed </p><p>power in December 2001.  In short order, the government </p><p>and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) re- </p><p>initiated the stalled Norwegian government facilitation </p><p>effort and put unilateral ceasefires into effect.  A </p><p>formal Norwegian-monitored ceasefire accord was signed </p><p>in February 2002.  Continuing the positive trend, the </p><p>two sides met in Thailand in September 2002 for their </p><p>first round of peace talks since 1995.  Before the talks </p><p>took place, the GSL met the long-standing demand of the </p><p>LTTE and lifted its ban on the organization.  The LTTE, </p><p>subsequently, edged away from its long-standing demand </p><p>for a separate state.  Since September, the government </p><p>and the LTTE have held five more rounds of talks.  In </p><p>addition, donor countries met at a conference in Oslo in </p><p>November 2002, with the Deputy Secretary in attendance. </p><p> </p><p>======================== </p><p>Tiger Pullout from Talks </p><p>======================== </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Despite so much progress in so short a time, the </p><p>situation remains highly fluid, with the LTTE\'s </p><p>commitment to the peace process in real question after </p><p>its April 21 decision to "suspend" its participation in </p><p>the peace talks.  At the same time, the group stated </p><p>that it would not attend the Tokyo donors conference in </p><p>June.  In making these announcements, the LTTE said it </p><p>wanted to see more progress on such matters as </p><p>humanitarian relief and a sharp reduction in the size of </p><p>the Jaffna security zones before coming back to the </p><p>talks.  There are recent signs that the Tigers may be </p><p>edging away from their hard-line stance, however.  The </p><p>tone of the group\'s reaction to our press statement on </p><p>their pullout from the talks was relatively moderate, </p><p>for example.  That said, despite feverish Norwegian and </p><p>Japanese efforts, it is still not clear whether the </p><p>peace process will be back on track soon. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Re the LTTE\'s intentions and motivations, we </p><p>think the group\'s pullout from the talks was tactical in </p><p>nature, with the LTTE\'s trying to reset the peace </p><p>process more to its advantage.  In the longer term, we </p><p>think it is likely that the group is using the peace </p><p>process more as a test to see if it can get power in the </p><p>north and east without the inconvenience of war rather </p><p>than as an honest-to-goodness parley that leads to real </p><p>ethnic reconciliation.  Some of the LTTE\'s policy </p><p>pronouncements raise red flags, for example, including </p><p>its apparent lack of interest in disarmament and </p><p>demobilization.  The group is also clearly unwilling to </p><p>end its arms resupply efforts.  The forced recruitment </p><p>of children is also a major human rights issue, as is </p><p>the group\'s assassination of Tamil opponents, </p><p>intimidation of Muslims in the east, and widespread use </p><p>of extortion.  In spite of these negative signs, the GSL </p><p>continues to hope that the peace process will help </p><p>domesticate the LTTE through time, strengthening </p><p>potential moderate elements in the group. </p><p> </p><p>===================== </p><p>Tensions in the South </p><p>===================== </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Another factor that could help unravel the peace </p><p>process is domestic opposition in the south.  While </p><p>playing to a small audience thus far, Sinhalese </p><p>chauvinists led by the radical Janantha Vimukthi </p><p>Peramuna (JVP) have engaged in rallies against the peace </p><p>process.  President Kumaratunga, meanwhile, has sent </p><p>mixed signals, at times constructive, at times critical. </p><p>Kumaratunga\'s attitude seems largely bound up in the </p><p>cohabitation tensions that routinely flare between her </p><p>and the government.  Most recently, Kumaratunga and her </p><p>party, the People\'s Alliance (PA), have been busily </p><p>trying to negotiate a pact with the JVP as a means to </p><p>counter the UNF government.  It is not clear whether a </p><p>PA-JVP alliance will come to fruition, but if it does </p><p>the reaction from the LTTE is bound to be sharply </p><p>critical. </p><p> </p><p>=============== </p><p>Economic Issues </p><p>=============== </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Sri Lanka\'s economic situation is quite delicate </p><p>and could have an impact on the peace process.  Although </p><p>it has the most open economy in South Asia and a </p><p>relatively high per capita income (USD 837), economic </p><p>growth has been uneven and is mostly confined to the </p><p>greater Colombo region.  The UNF government appears </p><p>committed to putting the right policies in place to re- </p><p>ignite economic growth, but it has moved haltingly.  If </p><p>economic progress is not made, opponents of the </p><p>government could gain added political traction, a </p><p>situation that could easily cascade to the detriment of </p><p>the peace process. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) Meanwhile, our trade relationship with Sri </p><p>Lanka is gaining strength.  The Trade and Investment </p><p>Framework Agreement (TIFA) signed last July in </p><p>Washington has produced two rounds of highly successful </p><p>bilateral talks.  At the second TIFA meeting in </p><p>Washington in March, Deputy USTR Jon Huntsman signaled </p><p>that the U.S. and Sri Lanka would soon begin moving </p><p>toward a bilateral Free Trade Agreement.  The FTA, which </p><p>we expect to be announced later this year, will provide </p><p>a much-needed boost to U.S. trade and investment here, </p><p>as well as to the GSL\'s economic reform efforts.  It </p><p>will also be a strong statement of our confidence in the </p><p>peace process and the economic potential of a united Sri </p><p>Lanka. </p><p> </p><p>============== </p><p>Defense Issues </p><p>============== </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) We have long maintained that a strong Sri Lankan </p><p>military is essential in keeping the Tigers at the </p><p>negotiating table.  The three U.S. Department of Defense </p><p>assessments conducted last fall identified several </p><p>critical weaknesses in the GSL\'s defense organization </p><p>that we are working to help alleviate.  Most notably, </p><p>Sri Lanka\'s lack of a viable maritime surveillance and </p><p>interdiction capability has allowed the LTTE to smuggle </p><p>new weapons and munitions into the country.  Sri Lanka </p><p>recently purchased a US aerial surveillance system, is </p><p>looking at acquiring new radars, will be granted a </p><p>refurbished U.S. Coast Guard Cutter under the excess </p><p>defense articles program, and hopes to buy 30mm </p><p>automatic cannons for their navy vessels.  Our </p><p>continuing support for these and other such initiatives </p><p>are key in ensuring that Sri Lanka\'s military is capable </p><p>of providing a position of strength from which the </p><p>government can negotiate. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) The GSL has consistently supported U.S. military </p><p>operations with blanket overflight and landing </p><p>clearances as well as access to ports.  As the peace </p><p>process continues, the military has begun to look </p><p>towards increasing participation in United Nations </p><p>peacekeeping operations and accepting a larger role in </p><p>assisting the U.S. in the global war on terror.  Most </p><p>recently, Sri Lanka even has begun to explore ways of </p><p>assisting in Iraqi reconstruction efforts, an area where </p><p>the military\'s resources and expertise could be </p><p>utilized. </p><p>========== </p><p>Key Points </p><p>========== </p><p>10. (C) This exciting and turbulent period in Sri Lanka </p><p>provides many opportunities for the U.S.  Prime Minister </p><p>Wickremesinghe has worked hard to move closer to the </p><p>U.S. (e.g., he played a key role in the GSL\'s signing of </p><p>an ICC Article 98 non-surrender agreement in November). </p><p>Per the recent policy review, the U.S. has taken steps </p><p>to enhance its engagement with the GSL, and, as noted </p><p>above, various high-level USG agencies have visited to </p><p>review commercial, economic, and defense issues.  Your </p><p>upcoming visit -- as with the Deputy Secretary\'s visit </p><p>in August 2002 and your previous visit in March 2002 -- </p><p>will help underline strong U.S. support for the peace </p><p>process and our hope for even closer bilateral ties. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (SBU) We suggest that you make the following key </p><p>points in your meetings with Sri Lankan officials: </p><p> </p><p>-- Express strong U.S. support for the peace process and </p><p>Norwegian facilitation. </p><p> </p><p>-- GSL needs to keep up momentum;  Sri Lanka is a vital </p><p>symbol of movement toward peace and stability in a </p><p>troubled South Asian region. </p><p> </p><p>-- All parties should work in national interest in </p><p>regard to the peace process and economic reform.  It is </p><p>important that peace process not falter because of </p><p>political infighting. </p><p> </p><p>-- Express appreciation to GSL for signing an ICC </p><p>Article 98 non-surrender agreement with U.S., and our </p><p>hope for even closer bilateral ties, including in </p><p>multilateral settings such as the UN. </p><p> </p><p>-- Express appreciation for Sri Lanka\'s continuous </p><p>support of our military operations through granting of </p><p>overflight and landing rights. </p><p> </p><p>-- Express continued support for defense related </p><p>initiatives and our growing military-to-military </p><p>relationship. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
