<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 KUWAIT 003604 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR INR/R/MR, NEA/ARP, NEA/PPD, PA, INR/NESA, </p><p>IIP/G/NEA-SA, INR/B </p><p>WHITE HOUSE FOR PRESS OFFICE </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH, PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p>SECDEF FOR OASD/PA </p><p>CINCCENT FOR CCPA </p><p>USDOC FOR 4520/ANESA/ONE/FITZGERALD-WILKS </p><p>USDOC FOR ITA AND PTO/OLIA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KU, KDMR </p><p>SUBJECT: KUWAIT MEDIA REACTION, AUGUST 2-4: ANNIVERSARY OF </p><p>IRAQI INVASION; GUANTANAMO DETAINEES; 9/11 REPORT; AMERICAN </p><p>AMBASSADOR TO KUWAIT </p><p> </p><p>REF: Kuwait 03267 </p><p> </p><p>1.   SUMMARY: Some commentators see the August 2 anniversary </p><p>of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait as a reminder of Iraqi </p><p>reparations still due to Kuwait and the POWs still </p><p>unaccounted for, while others evince a desire to move </p><p>forward with reforms and national development now that this </p><p>external threat has been lifted. </p><p> </p><p>All newspapers report a statement by the Minister of Foreign </p><p>Affairs, Sheikh Dr. Mohammad Al-Sabah that the U.S. and </p><p>Kuwait are holding talks on Kuwaiti detainees at Guantanamo </p><p>Bay. One Islamist commentator demands greater government </p><p>efforts to win the release of the detainees. Another </p><p>Islamist sees "Zionist lobbyists" as behind the 9/11 report </p><p>that reflects an "American campaign against Saudi Arabia." </p><p> </p><p>A conservative writer directs another in a series of </p><p>critical comments (reftel) against American Ambassador to </p><p>Kuwait Richard H. Jones, accusing the Ambassador of </p><p>"unjustifiable interference in our affairs in a repugnant </p><p>and provoking manner" through the Ambassador\'s attendance at </p><p>local social events and his newspaper interviews. END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.   News Stories: All newspapers report on August 4 </p><p>statements by the Minister of Foreign Affairs Sheikh Dr. </p><p>Mohammad Al-Sabah that Kuwait and the US are holding talks </p><p>regarding the Kuwaiti detainees held at Guantanamo Bay. </p><p> </p><p>Al-Anba reports on August 3 that "a number" of RPGs were </p><p>fired from the Iraqi side of the border into Kuwait. No </p><p>casualties were reported. Al-Anba also reports that eight </p><p>"spies" have been arrested in recent days as the result of </p><p>intelligence gained from captured Iraqi documents. </p><p> </p><p>On August 4, all newspapers report that the remains of two </p><p>more Kuwaiti POWs found in Iraq have been identified. All </p><p>papers also report that a team will begin searching for </p><p>remains of Kuwaiti POWs that may have been buried in Kuwait </p><p>during the Iraqi occupation of 1990-91. </p><p> </p><p>Al-Seyassah reports that Prime Minister Sheikh Sabah Al- </p><p>Ahmad has asked the Minister of Interior to prepare a list </p><p>of "bedoons" (stateless residents in Kuwait) that should be </p><p>considered for naturalization. </p><p> </p><p>The President of Kuwait University, Dr. Nader Al-Jallal, </p><p>states that the university is on the way to fully </p><p>implementing gender segregation in all its colleges, Al- </p><p>Qabas reports. </p><p> </p><p>Editorials: </p><p> </p><p>3.  "August 2, 1990 is Like No Other Date" </p><p>Editor-in-chief of independent Al-Rai Al-Aam, Jassim Boodai, </p><p>opined (8/2):  "August 2, 1990 was a day that changed the </p><p>lives of Kuwaitis and caused an earthquake in the region. </p><p>This has changed since April 9, 2003, because Iraqis are </p><p>living a different life now. As for Kuwait, our priorities </p><p>must also change. We demand to put an end to our political, </p><p>economical and psychological suffering because it is not </p><p>appropriate any longer to hold on to our obsession with </p><p>security to the detriment of other issues. We should benefit </p><p>from the fall of Saddam by launching major political reforms </p><p>that could lead Kuwait to assume a high role in </p><p>international relations." </p><p> </p><p>4.  "This Memory is Behind Us" </p><p>Editor-in-chief of independent Al-Qabas, Waleed Al-Nesf, </p><p>opined (8/2): "For the first time ever, August 2, 1990 is </p><p>behind us. Nevertheless, we still have many lessons to </p><p>learn, and most of our problems have not yet been solved. </p><p>Now that the Iraqi regime has ended, we have to turn a new </p><p>page by focusing on our economic development and other </p><p>important issues. </p><p>5.  "In Order Not to Forget" </p><p>Editor-in-chief of independent Al-Anba, Bibi Al-Marzouk </p><p>opined (8/2): "We will not forget [the Iraqi invasion of </p><p>1990] because our demands are still on the table, awaiting </p><p>an Iraqi government. We will only forget if the Iraqis begin </p><p>to recognize our borders and sovereignty. We demand a change </p><p>in their educational curricula because Iraqi students still </p><p>believe that Kuwait is part of Iraq. We will only forget if </p><p>they fully compensate us [through reparations as a result of </p><p>the invasion] because this is our right. We will only forget </p><p>once we know the fate of our POWs. We will only forget when </p><p>the Iraqi government apologizes for the crimes committed </p><p>against us. Once all these terms have been met, then we will </p><p>forget." </p><p> </p><p>6.  Conservative Dr. Sami Khalifa wrote in independent Al- </p><p>Rai Al-Aam (8/2):  "I am astonished at the American </p><p>Ambassador who intervenes in our internal affairs by </p><p>ignoring all diplomatic norms and traditions which he should </p><p>respect. He does not miss an opportunity to participate in a </p><p>press interview, diwaniya calls, cultural forums, or social </p><p>events and unjustifiably interfere in a repugnant and </p><p>provoking manner. Will the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have </p><p>a word with this Ambassador?" </p><p> </p><p>7.  "[National Assembly Speaker] Al-Kharafi Exploded in the </p><p>Face of Americans" </p><p>Islamist Mohammad Al-Awadi wrote in independent Al-Rai Al- </p><p>Aam (8/2):  "Not too long ago, the government unjustifiably </p><p>retracted its efforts to demand the return of our detainees </p><p>from Guantanamo despite Kuwait\'s role in supporting the </p><p>Americans in the war to liberate Iraq. Kuwait opened its air </p><p>space and its land, and exposed itself to many dangers for </p><p>the America forces as a result. The Kuwaiti government must </p><p>exploit this situation by demanding from Washington the </p><p>release of our detainees in Guantanamo." </p><p> </p><p>8.  "The Secret Behind the Attack on Saudi Arabia" </p><p>Islamist Dr. Wael Al-Hasawi wrote in independent Al-Rai Al- </p><p>Aam (7/31):  "I do not know the reason for the American </p><p>campaign against Saudi Arabia and I do not know on what </p><p>grounds reports are being published alleging the Kingdom\'s </p><p>involvement in the September 11 attacks. Reason and logic </p><p>indicates that it would be impossible for Saudi Arabia to </p><p>hurt the US. Moreover, the Saudi-American relationship has </p><p>been strong since the establishment of the kingdom. I don\'t </p><p>have an answer, except to look to the Zionist lobby which </p><p>controls State Department policy and thinks differently from </p><p>how sensible Americans think." </p><p> </p><p>9.  "Is America Going to Stay in the Gulf?" </p><p>Dr. Hisham Al-Awadi wrote in independent Al-Watan (8/1): </p><p>"[T]he absence of Saddam and the achievement of stability in </p><p>Iraq my raise complicated questions over the future of the </p><p>American existence in the region. Iraqis have raised these </p><p>questions openly, while the people of the Gulf are asking </p><p>the same questions secretly. The justification for an </p><p>American presence is gradually disappearing. Unless the US </p><p>justifies its presence in the region, one can expect this </p><p>part of the world to enter into a new period of security </p><p>tensions." </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
