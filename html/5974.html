REASON:  1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Nepal\'s Coca-Cola bottler is continuing to receive </p><p>extortion demands from the Maoists, despite the cease-fire </p><p>and a claimed commitment by Maoist leader Prachanda to stop </p><p>such practices (Ref C).  In coordination with Coca-Cola\'s </p><p>Country Manager and its corporate offices in Atlanta and </p><p>Bangkok, the Embassy is executing an action plan aimed at </p><p>ending the continued extortion.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>Threats to Coca-Cola in Nepal </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) In December 2002 and January 2003, the Maoists sent </p><p>extortion letters to Coca-Cola\'s local representative in </p><p>Kathmandu, demanding USD 38,000 from the company, and </p><p>containing implied threats of further violence at company </p><p>facilities (Refs A and B).  (Note:  The Maoists have set </p><p>bombs at Coca-Cola facilities here on three separate </p><p>occasions since 2001.  End note.)  In a January 22 meeting </p><p>with the RSO, DCM, and econoff, Coca-Cola security officials </p><p>presented a strategy they described as "defer and deflect," </p><p>in which the bottler would spin out discussions with the </p><p>Maoists without ever paying the insurgents any money. </p><p>Emboffs suggested a public relations campaign calling </p><p>attention to the extortion activities, highlighting the </p><p>potential damage to the local economy if foreign investors </p><p>and employers like Coca-Cola leave Nepal.  The Coca-Cola </p><p>security officials undertook to discuss the idea with company </p><p>public relations officials. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Extortion:  A Grandfather Clause? </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  One week after the meeting, the Maoists declared a </p><p>ceasefire with the Government of Nepal (GON).  Apparently </p><p>stung by public criticism that Maoist extortion persisted </p><p>despite the ceasefire, on February 16 insurgent leader </p><p>Prachanda announced that he had instructed his cadre to </p><p>desist from collecting any funds other than "voluntary </p><p>donations" (Ref D).  On February 25, however,  N.N. Singh, </p><p>Coca-Cola\'s Country Manager, reported to Emboffs that two </p><p>Maoists had come to his office again on February 22 to pursue </p><p>their earlier demands.  (Note:  One of the visitors Singh </p><p>said he has met with several times; the other he had not seen </p><p>before.  End note.)  Singh said that when he raised </p><p>Prachanda\'s directive to his cadre to cease extortion, his </p><p>interlocutor replied that the demand remained valid because </p><p>it predated Prachanda\'s Feb. 16 order.  In fact, the Maoist </p><p>claimed that the ceasefire had actually raised his local </p><p>funding requirements, since he now must pay to feed and house </p><p>the many Maoist cadre streaming into Kathmandu.  Singh said </p><p>he told the Maoist representatives the demand would have to </p><p>be referred to corporate headquarters in Atlanta, and asked </p><p>them to contact him on February 28 for a formal response. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Singh told emboffs he knows that Coca-Cola will not </p><p>pay, and is worried about his Feb. 28 appointment with the </p><p>Maoists.  He doubts they would use violence against him </p><p>during the ceasefire, but fears they may exact revenge after </p><p>the ceasefire ends (which he apparently believes will be just </p><p>a matter of time).  When asked if he had notified the GON of </p><p>the demand and requested police protection, he noted ruefully </p><p>the last time he had done so the drunken carousing of the </p><p>five policemen assigned to his house had kept him up all </p><p>night.  He added that the Maoists  had themselves said they </p><p>prefer not to visit him at home anyway because of his </p><p>proximity to a U.S. Embassy house.  (Note:  Mr. Singh\'s </p><p>residence is on the same street as that of the DATT.  End </p><p>note.)  He asked that the Embassy pass a message to the </p><p>Maoists, possibly through Physical Planning Minister Narayan </p><p>Singh Pun, who is coordinating GON efforts to begin </p><p>negotiations, to desist from extortion.  Emboffs undertook to </p><p>include this suggestion in its ongoing consultations with </p><p>regional Coca-Cola officials about possible future actions. </p><p> </p><p>Embassy Action Plan </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) On February 25 Lee Winfield, Coca-Cola\'s Director of </p><p>Public Affairs and Communications for South East and West </p><p>Asia, contacted econoff to relay approval of the public </p><p>relations strategy outlined in Para 2 above.  Econoff, noting </p><p>Singh\'s visit earlier in the day, proposed a three-part </p><p>strategy for Embassy action:  a) contacting Minister Pun to </p><p>urge him to raise the issue with the Maoist leadership; b) </p><p>sending a parallel message to other Maoist intermediaries; </p><p>and c) should these efforts fail to prevent continued </p><p>extortion, issuing a public statement condemning Maoist </p><p>threats to U.S.-affiliated businesses.  Winfield endorsed the </p><p>strategy with the support of Coca-Cola\'s corporate offices in </p><p>Atlanta, with the proviso that Coca-Cola not be specifically </p><p>mentioned in any public or private communication. </p><p> </p><p>At Ambassador\'s Request, GON Support </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) The Ambassador called Minister Pun on February 26 to </p><p>request that the GON raise the continued extortion of </p><p>American businesses as a point of concern with the Maoist </p><p>leadership.  The Ambassador did not mention Coca-Cola, but </p><p>emphasized that threats to U.S. business are taken seriously </p><p>by the USG, which continues to review the possibility of </p><p>adding the Maoists to one of its terrorist lists.  Pun </p><p>committed to raising the issue during a February 27 meeting </p><p>with Maoist representatives. </p><p> </p><p>Working with the Chambers of Commerce </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU)  At a February 27 breakfast with the Nepal-USA </p><p>Chamber of Commerce, the Ambassador asked other businessmen </p><p>if they were continuing to receive extortion demands.  Most </p><p>said no, but a few, while not acknowledging direct threats, </p><p>indicated that the practice is continuing.  Noting the </p><p>Maoists\' continued need for funds, some speculated that the </p><p>demands might resume shortly.  The participants all said they </p><p>believed a general statement from the Embassy condemning </p><p>extortion (but not mentioning any company or individual </p><p>names) might prove beneficial.  The members\' also agreed with </p><p>the Ambassador\'s suggestion to raise the matter with other </p><p>bilateral Chambers of Commerce and their respective embassies </p><p>and explore the possibility of issuing a joint statement </p><p>condemning extortion.  The Ambassador has raised the problem </p><p>with the British and Indian Ambassadors and with the head of </p><p>the Nepal-India Chamber of Commerce. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  It is difficult to determine whether the extortion </p><p>demands are persisting with the complicity of the Maoist </p><p>leadership, or whether this is an independent local </p><p>initiative.  Whatever the source of the demands, we are </p><p>hopeful that Pun\'s message will succeed in turning them off. </p><p>If not, we are prepared, with Coca-Cola\'s blessing, to </p><p>publicize the Maoists\' hypocrisy. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
