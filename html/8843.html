<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 003654 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>PLEASE PASS TO SECRETARY\'S PARTY </p><p>USDOC 4520/ITA/MAC/ONE/PTHANOS </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR E FOR LARSON </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EB FOR WAYNE </p><p>ATHENS FOR TSA FOR MONTGOMERY </p><p>FRANKFURT FOR TSA FOR HARRIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAIR, ETRD, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: BAD NEWS FOR RJ </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) STATE 162415 </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED; PLEASE HANDLE ACCORDINGLY </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) SUMMARY: Ambassador Gnehm followed up with Royal </p><p>Jordanian Airlines (RJ) CEO Majali on recent Transportation </p><p>Security Administration (TSA) visits and meetings in </p><p>Washington between RJ officials and DAS John Byerly.  The </p><p>Ambassador stressed to Majali the importance of taking </p><p>seriously TSA guidance and directives, the need to decouple </p><p>RJ\'s prospective purchase of Boeing jets from bidding on </p><p>service rights to Baghdad, and the likelihood that any </p><p>decision on the composition of Iraqi Air will have to wait </p><p>for an interim Iraqi government.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>TSA: STRAIGHTEN UP AND FLY RIGHT </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Ambassador Gnehm, accompanied by Econoff, called on </p><p>Royal Jordanian Airlines (RJ) CEO Samer Majali on June 16. </p><p>The Ambassador took advantage of the meeting to reinforce the </p><p>strong messages on security and cooperation with TSA that </p><p>were delivered to RJ by visiting TSA officials in Amman in </p><p>early June and in Majali\'s recent meetings in Washington </p><p>(ref).  He stressed the need for RJ to take TSA directives </p><p>seriously and to implement them as quickly as possible. </p><p>Majali said that he had received a letter from Minister of </p><p>Transport Dahabi stating that RJ was "basically not in </p><p>compliance" with TSA policy and that the airline needed to </p><p>fulfill TSA directives according to deadlines agreed during </p><p>the visit. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Majali, however, said "TSA did not take proper </p><p>minutes or give us a report telling us how we are expected to </p><p>comply."  Noting that the Minister\'s letter (which had been </p><p>prepared by Civil Aviation Authority staff) served this </p><p>purpose by clearly outlining four important deadlines agreed </p><p>to by RJ and the TSA, the Ambassador told Majali that RJ\'s </p><p>credibility was on the line.  It was critical that all RJ and </p><p>other security staff take TSA\'s requirements extremely </p><p>seriously.  He said it was important that RJ and TSA maintain </p><p>frank and open channels of communication through which they </p><p>could address each others\' concerns. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  The Ambassador stressed that TSA has the final </p><p>word on whether or not RJ is in compliance with U.S. </p><p>regulations and thus able to continue to fly to the U.S.  If </p><p>TSA decided to suspend RJ flights to the U.S., no one in the </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>U.S. Government would or could overrule them.  Majali replied </p><p>that all deadlines would be met, and added that the airline </p><p>was appointing one person to be responsible for all safety </p><p>and security issues. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>IRAQ-BOEING LINKAGE: A MISTAKE </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) Also following up on reftel conversation, the </p><p>Ambassador told Majali that he had made a mistake in seeking </p><p>to link RJ\'s initiative on helping establish air service in </p><p>Iraq to its decision between Boeing and Airbus for RJ\'s </p><p>acquisition of new short-term jets.  Majali called this  a </p><p>"misunderstanding" of RJ\'s intent.  His point was that the </p><p>economic advantage of RJ expanding its activities to Iraq </p><p>would help offset what he said was the $25 million additional </p><p>cost of 737\'s versus A320s.  Since he assumed that any Iraqi </p><p>airline would go with Boeing, this could also lead to </p><p>"greater commonality" with RJ.  The Ambassador advised Majali </p><p>to separate the jet purchase from service to Baghdad since </p><p>decisions on Iraq\'s civil aviation regime could be a long </p><p>time coming. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU)  Comment:  The DCM had previously covered similar </p><p>ground on the security issues with Transportation Minister </p><p>Nader Dahabi and CAA Director General Hanna Najjar.  We </p><p>believe the airline and the government have got the message </p><p>that TSA is serious and that they can not afford to waste </p><p>Jordan\'s good reputation on security issues. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU)  The Jordanians clearly made a serious tactical </p><p>mistake in allowing the perception to persist that they are </p><p>linking a decision on aircraft replacement to their </p><p>initiative on Iraq.  Disturbingly, we understand that Majali </p><p>continued to pursue this tack in a meeting with Boeing CEO </p><p>Phil Condit this week in Paris.  Condit and senior Boeing </p><p>executives will be in Jordan over the weekend for the World </p><p>Economic Forum meeting at the Dead Sea, where they will </p><p>undoubtedly meet senior Jordanians including the King.  We </p><p>will convey this message to others in the decision-making </p><p>chain on the aircraft decision.  Senior U.S. officials who </p><p>are here for the WEF meetings, including Secretary Powell and </p><p>U/S Larson, may also wish to reinforce that now is the time </p><p>to make a decision and that Boeing is the most qualified </p><p>provider. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
