<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 RANGOON 000554 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/06/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PTER, BM </p><p>SUBJECT: EAP DAS DALEY MEETS WITH SPDC SECRETARY ONE </p><p>GENERAL KHIN NYUNT - DISCUSSIONS ON COUNTER-TERRORISM, </p><p>POLITICAL DIALOGUE, AND PRISONER RELEASES SHOW SOME RESULT </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 102828 (NOTAL) </p><p>     B. RANGOON 00539 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: COM CARMEN M. MARTINEZ FOR REASONS 1.5 (B AND D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY:  EAP DAS Matt Daley, COM, and DCM (note </p><p>taker) met with Secretary 1, General Khin Nyunt April 27 in </p><p>Rangoon.  General Khin Nyunt emphasized counter-terrorism </p><p>cooperation and the added security the GOB has provided to </p><p>the U.S. Embassy.  Daley urged the GOB to accelerate dialogue </p><p>with the NLD, to increase press freedoms, and to release more </p><p>political prisoners.  Since the meeting, twenty-one political </p><p>prisoners have been released, including Dr. Salai Tun Than </p><p>(Ref B). According to the Burmese embassy in Washington, Dr. </p><p>Salai Tun Than\'s release was ordered in direct response to </p><p>DAS Daley\'s request.  He also called on Senior General Than </p><p>Shwe to meet with UN Special Envoy Razali soon.  S-1 said </p><p>Razali would be invited for a visit in June.  The General </p><p>said Aung San Suu Kyi was "conceited" and although allowed to </p><p>travel around the country, had criticized the government in a </p><p>"very condescending manner."  DAS Daley suggested he "set </p><p>aside the protocol book, invite her to lunch, and sit down </p><p>and talk with her with no set agenda."  Results of the </p><p>demarche requested Ref A were reported separately.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) COUNTER-TERRORISM: Secretary 1, General Khin Nyunt </p><p>(the head of Military Intelligence and the third-ranking </p><p>officer in the ruling State Peace and Development Committee) </p><p>was accompanied by the Foreign Minister, the Deputy Foreign </p><p>Minister, and three other officials during the call by Daley, </p><p>COM, and DCM. </p><p> </p><p>-- After reftel demarche was delivered and discussed (see </p><p>septel reply to Ref A), Khin Nyunt spoke of the close </p><p>counter-terrorism cooperation extended by the GOB to the USG, </p><p>highlighting the added security provided the embassy during </p><p>the war in Iraq.  Daley thanked S-1 for the added security </p><p>and noted that terrorism in Southeast Asia was a bigger </p><p>concern than many people had previously realized. </p><p> </p><p>-- Khin Nyunt recounted the March 27 bomb attacks in Rangoon, </p><p>reporting one fatality (vice two, as we had previously </p><p>thought).  Daley noted that when we learned of these </p><p>bombings, we called them acts of terrorism and condemned </p><p>them.  S-1 also termed the recent sabotage of a natural gas </p><p>pipeline, reportedly by KNU insurgents, a terrorist attack. </p><p>(NOTE: the GOB has frequently attempted to blur the </p><p>distinction between terrorism per se and other forms of </p><p>violence related to ongoing ethnic insurgencies.) </p><p> </p><p>-- The general added, "We are trying our best to prevent </p><p>terrorism--we are taking steps to assure that our country </p><p>will not be used as a stepping stone to export terrorism to </p><p>other countries." </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) DIALOGUE WITH THE NLD: Daley stated that there is a </p><p>sense of disappointment in the U.S. and in the broader </p><p>international community that the process of dialogue appears </p><p>to be losing momentum.  We would hope this process could be </p><p>accelerated, DAS Daley emphasized.  General Khin Nyunt </p><p>responded pointedly, saying: </p><p> </p><p>"We are not trying to avoid dialogue with the NLD, but she </p><p>(ASSK) is very conceited.  Anyway, she has not yet proposed </p><p>any dialogue.  We let her travel in the country and what does </p><p>she do?  She criticizes the government in a very </p><p>condescending manner and stirs up the people against the </p><p>government." </p><p> </p><p>Daley commented that while Aung San Suu Kyi was undoubtedly </p><p>strong-willed both in personality and principles, the </p><p>government is powerful, and need not fear destabilization if </p><p>it moves forward on the democracy and human rights agenda. </p><p>Further, he had never known her to make a disrespectful </p><p>comment about the military as an institution even as she </p><p>called for a transformed polity.  DAS Daley urged Khin Nyunt </p><p>to set aside the protocol book, invite Aung San Suu Kyi to </p><p>lunch, and open a discussion with no set agenda. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) POLITICAL PRISONERS: Daley made a strong pitch to Khin </p><p>Nyunt to make a mass release of political prisoners as soon </p><p>as next month, adding that freeing all the political </p><p>prisoners would not threaten regime stability.  This would be </p><p>seen as an act of confidence and good faith by other nations, </p><p>international organizations, and potential business partners. </p><p> The more serious threat to the regime is economic, DAS Daley </p><p>continued, and an act of confidence and good faith could help </p><p>on that front.  COM proposed that, pending the release of all </p><p>political prisoners, the GOB release a group of approximately </p><p>190 prisoners who are suffering from severe physical and </p><p>mental illnesses.  COM and DAS also requested that an Embassy </p><p>consular officer be allowed to visit Dr. Salai Tun Than, as </p><p>his case has generated substantial congressional and public </p><p>interest and concern in the United States.  Regarding all </p><p>three proposals, General Khin Nyunt nodded and said, "I will </p><p>look into it." (Note: Per Ref B, three political prisoners </p><p>were released just a few days after this meeting.  Dr. Salai </p><p>Tun Than and 17 other political prisoners were released on </p><p>May 4th.  According to the Burmese embassy in Washington, the </p><p>release of Dr. Salai Tun Than was ordered in direct response </p><p>to DAS Daley\'s request.  End Note). </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) THE MEDIA: At Aung San Suu Kyi\'s request, DAS Daley </p><p>commented that the GOB-controlled media does not acknowledge </p><p>or even mention the NLD, in contrast to the regime\'s press </p><p>releases to foreign governments and media outlets, which </p><p>frequently mention prospects for possible cooperation or </p><p>talks with the NLD.  Could there be a bit more openness in </p><p>the local media?  S-1 did not respond. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) RAZALI: When DAS Daley pressed Khin Nyunt to invite </p><p>UN Special Envoy Razali back to Burma quickly and to assure </p><p>that he meets with Senior General Than Shwe, Khin Nyunt </p><p>replied that unfortunately the schedule for May was full.  He </p><p>was happy to announce, however, that Razali had just been </p><p>invited to come back in June. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) COMMENT: As always, Khin Nyunt conducted himself in </p><p>the polished, professional manner that has become something </p><p>of his trademark.  Within a regime of distinctly unpolished </p><p>generals, one of his key roles is to be the presentable face </p><p>of the SPDC to foreigners.  He was cordial and seemingly </p><p>agreeable even on the issue of a mass political prisoner </p><p>release.  However, he lost his suavity momentarily when </p><p>describing Aung San Suu Kyi.  There is clearly no love lost </p><p>between them.  Interestingly, as Daley made the point on </p><p>moving the political dialogue forward, the MFA attendees and </p><p>even Major Myo Aung could be seen to nod their heads in </p><p>agreement.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) DAS Daley has cleared on this message. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
