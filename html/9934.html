<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 001338 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/06/2013 </p><p>TAGS: EPET, PINS, ASEC, PGOV, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: RESTARTING OIL PRODUCTION IN WARRI </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA 1333 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Charge d\'Affaires, a.i. Dawn M. Liberi; reasons </p><p>1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.(C) Summary:  Into its fifth month, the crisis in Warri </p><p>probably has cost the Government of Nigeria several hundred </p><p>million U.S. dollars in lost revenue and continues to </p><p>truncate the country\'s oil production by almost 20 percent. </p><p>Despite this serious diminution and likely eager to return to </p><p>full production, the companies have indicated that they may </p><p>be willing to wait for the GON to take the difficult but </p><p>necessary steps to establish control over the area.  End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.(C) After the March 2003 outbreak of violence around </p><p>Warri, Chevron and Shell ceased production both on-shore and </p><p>off-shore in the area.  This cut over 800,000 barrels per day </p><p>(bpd) or roughly 40 percent of Nigeria\'s production.  In </p><p>mid-April, both companies resumed offshore production, </p><p>reducing the loss to 15-20 percent.  To date,  on-shore </p><p>facilities remain closed.  Company security officers deem the </p><p>environment not secure enough to resume operations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.(C) Over the past month, Delta State Governor Ibori has </p><p>traveled throughout this part of his state visiting closed </p><p>oil installations and talking with community leaders and </p><p>armed militants of the Federated Niger Delta Ijaw Communities </p><p>(FNDIC).  After his tour to dulcify the area, Ibori claimed </p><p>the environment was safe enough for the companies to return </p><p>and resume production.  He will likely renew that claim once </p><p>the current round of fighting subsides.  In a mid-July </p><p>meeting, Ibori had told the CRO that he is confident the </p><p>local communities (and by inference, the Ijaw militants) will </p><p>allow the companies to resume operations with the protection </p><p>of federal troops. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Ibori\'s efforts notwithstanding, the companies insist </p><p>that armed federal security personnel be stationed at the </p><p>reopened oil installations in sufficient strength to deter or </p><p>repel attacks by armed militants.  However, the militants </p><p>like their new found autonomy and are opposed to  any troop </p><p>deployments.  A confrontation is likely should the military </p><p>deploy more aggressively.  This probability leads some </p><p>company security officials to call for a well-planned </p><p>military sweep through the area.  (Note: see reftel report of </p><p>President Obasanjo\'s August 6 warning of a possible imminent </p><p>security operation.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SHELL\'S FALSE START </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.(C) According to Shell\'s Coordinator for Security Mike </p><p>Achu, Shell attempted to reopen one flow station -- Jones </p><p>Creek, in Warri North LGA -- on/about July 25 but ceased </p><p>after only a few days.  Achu claims that the deployment of </p><p>some 30 Nigerian army troops to the flow station -- essential </p><p>for the security of Shell staff at the facility  -- had not </p><p>been fully coordinated with military headquarters in Abuja </p><p>and the local army commander pulled them back to barracks in </p><p>Effurun.  Another industry source claims that Shell had </p><p>attempted to negotiate with the  militants through the peace </p><p>efforts of Delta Governor Ibori.  The FNDIC is willing to </p><p>allow the flow station to reopen but, as noted previously, it </p><p>is against soldiers deployed in areas it claims to control -- </p><p>a detail which spelled the doom of the  attempted restart of </p><p>the facility. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CHEVRON SEES A SILVER LINING </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.(C) During a July 30 meeting at Chevron\'s Headquarters, CRO </p><p>and ECONOFF asked the company\'s senior coordinator for </p><p>security, Hamish MacDonald, for an assessment of Warri. </p><p>MacDonald characterized the ongoing stalemate between the </p><p>Ijaw militants and the GON as an opportunity for Chevron to </p><p>change its approach to security and community relations.  A </p><p>cycle of extortion had been allowed to develop, fed by oil </p><p>company efforts to win the support of local communities </p><p>through assistance, generous hiring of locals and even </p><p>outright payoffs. This must stop, declared Hamish; rule of </p><p>law must be established in its place.  He pointed to the </p><p>deployment of a large-scale military force to pacify the area </p><p>now controlled by Ijaw militants as the first step in this </p><p>strategy.  Only after the area is secured by federal </p><p>government forces should Chevron resume production. </p><p>Anything less would leave the company vulnerable to </p><p>extortion attempts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.(C) MacDonald claimed that Chevron is prepared to take the </p><p>tough decision of foregoing opportunities to restart </p><p>production in the near-term in favor of waiting for a durable </p><p>resolution of the security crisis.  Noting that the GON is </p><p>absorbing the far greater cost of the reduction (as the GON </p><p>would normally receive an estimated 80 percent of the </p><p>revenue) Chevron hopes that Shell will join forces to press </p><p>the GON to assume its responsibility as security provider for </p><p>the oil producing areas. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Confusing Signals from a Confused Government </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.(C) Thanks largely to efforts by Shell to publicly </p><p>highlight the large-scale theft of oil, President Obasanjo </p><p>and his security team have paid increased attention to this </p><p>loss of oil.  The GON\'s recent intense focus on oil theft, </p><p>may have overshadowed the more serious security threat </p><p>presented by inter-ethnic conflict in Warri.  Some observers </p><p>suggest this reflects general confusion over how to proceed </p><p>or the GON\'s lack of good intelligence on the militancy </p><p>threat now facing it.  The Presidency has yet to produce a </p><p>comprehensive strategy for dealing with the Warri security </p><p>crisis that would bring the oil in that region back on line. </p><p>Instead, the President appears to be directing a military </p><p>deployment to confront the armed militants in the Warri </p><p>swamps. (see reftel)  MacDonald, who attended the Chevron </p><p>MD\'s July 16 meeting with President Obasanjo, claims that the </p><p>President has committed $50-100 million in NNPC "matching </p><p>funds" for the purchase of river boats and other equipment </p><p>needed by the Army and Navy to take carry out an operation in </p><p>Warri.  (Note: According to industry sources, the cost of </p><p>this $100 million worth of military procurement will </p><p>ultimately be borne by NNPC, Shell and Chevron in accordance </p><p>with their joint venture capital funding formula. End note) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.(C) The renewed fighting in the Warri LGAs has sidelined </p><p>attempts to negotiate the companies\' resumption of operations </p><p>in the area, but these efforts will resume with the next lull </p><p>in the fighting.  Shell and Chevron have largely resisted </p><p>this federal and Delta State government pressure to return to </p><p>the Warri swamps.  Citing adverse security conditions, they </p><p>have also declared "force majeure," releasing them of </p><p>production commitments under joint venture agreements with </p><p>the GON.  The companies seem able to absorb the lost proceeds </p><p>of Warri oil production.  However, we doubt the GON can </p><p>afford this luxury.  The companies may resist a restoration </p><p>of the status quo ante and insist that the GON establish its </p><p>writ throughout the region before the companies deploy their </p><p>human and material resources. </p><p>10.(C) The companies are right to place responsibility for </p><p>security squarely on the federal government\'s doorstep.  The </p><p>GON must tackle what amounts to a very expensive and public </p><p>usurpation of its authority in the Warri area.  This will </p><p>likely require a policy action by the GON.  Once the </p><p>immediate security challenge is handled, the GON cannot </p><p>return to its posture of sustained neglect of the Delta.  A </p><p>lasting solution will require a major GON commitment of </p><p>security and social resources.  Anything less will allow the </p><p>Warri crisis to worsen and spread to other areas of the Niger </p><p>Delta, where would-be-militants are keenly watching the </p><p>efforts of the FNDIC in Warri.  In the long-run, both </p><p>Nigerian and U.S. strategic interests would suffer. </p><p>LIBERI </p><p></p></div>
