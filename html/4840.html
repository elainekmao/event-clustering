<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ISTANBUL 002195 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, EB/IFD/OMA AND EUR/SE </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA - MILLS AND LEICHTER </p><p>STATE PASS USTR - NOVELLI AND BIRDSEY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/16/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, ECON, EFIN, TU, Istanbul </p><p>SUBJECT: LIMITED COPENHAGEN FALLOUT FAILS TO PROVIDE RELIEF </p><p>TO TURKISH MARKETS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 9075 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Consul General David Arnett. </p><p> Reasons: 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary: The week after Copenhagen has been a tough </p><p>one on Turkey\'s financial markets.  The Istanbul Stock </p><p>Exchange (ISE) has slumped dramatically, losing over 14 </p><p>percent of its value, the Turkish lira has depreciated 7 </p><p>percent, and interest rates on lira-denominated Treasury </p><p>bills have spiked up to over 55 percent (a rise of 5 </p><p>percent).  Istanbul market analysts ascribe the declines, </p><p>however, not to disappointment with the summit\'s outcome, but </p><p>to a return to the country\'s "real" agenda.  That agenda, </p><p>they suggest, was largely drowned out in the media build-up </p><p>to Copenhagen.  But now, attention is again returning to the </p><p>other issues and risks before Turkey, including notably the </p><p>prospect of an imminent military operation against Iraq and </p><p>political uncertainty surrounding a new and largely untested </p><p>majority government.  As for Copenhagen itself, analysts </p><p>ascribed its lack of resonance not just to the decision\'s </p><p>openness to interpretation, but to a concerted effort by </p><p>Turkish government, business, and media to spin it </p><p>positively.  End  Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) Unsettled Markets: Markets have been active and </p><p>unsettled over the last week.  In the first two days after </p><p>the summit, the ISE slumped nearly 12 percent.  After </p><p>stabilizing briefly, it resumed its downward trend on </p><p>Thursday, December 19.  The lira and interest rates, Turkey\'s </p><p>other two key economic indicators, responded similarly, with </p><p>interest rates spiking back up to the mid-50s, and the lira </p><p>again depreciating to a rate above 1.6 million to the dollar. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) EU Blues: Though increasing optimism in the run-up to </p><p>Copenhagen about the prospects for a firm starting date for </p><p>negotiations sparked fears that the markets would react </p><p>negatively to the eventual outcome, in fact comment and </p><p>reaction has been muted.  Cem Akyurek, research director at </p><p>Global, Turkey\'s largest brokerage, attributed the reaction </p><p>to a concerted effort by government, business, and media to </p><p>put the best face on what he characterized as a "strikingly </p><p>negative" decision.  Easing the task were the conflicting </p><p>opinions about the outcome not just in the Turkish and </p><p>international press, but from European and other leaders. </p><p>Akyurek, who has been sceptical about AK\'s economic policies </p><p>and leadership, also gave the government grudging credit for </p><p>its "mature" response.  He pointed to the government\'s </p><p>message that it remains committed to pressing forward on </p><p>reform as an essential balm for the market, a view echoed by </p><p>other analysts.  Bender Securities, for instance, </p><p>characterized the "EU anchor" as a key positive over the long </p><p>term in its daily market report. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) The "Real" Agenda: The market\'s ability to come to </p><p>terms relatively quickly with the Copenhagen outcome has not </p><p>provided overall relief, however.  Most analysts ascribe the </p><p>negative trend to concern about Iraq and the prospects for </p><p>imminent military action.  Others point also to initial </p><p>missteps by the new government, particularly in the economic </p><p>field, where lack of coordination has brought conflicting </p><p>messages on issues ranging from Turkey\'s new public tender </p><p>law (and whether the government plans to delay its </p><p>implementation or not) to return of a portion of the </p><p>compulsory savings accounts collected by the government in </p><p>past decades.  On these issues, analysts remain divided. </p><p>Akyurek remains strikingly pessimistic about AK and its </p><p>plans, noting that the mixed messages he and visiting </p><p>investors have heard in Ankara also extend to such key issues </p><p>as maintenance of primary surplus and inflation targets. </p><p>Others, however, are more sanguine: HC Istanbul Director Elif </p><p>Zapparoli told us that she would be "shocked" if AK actually </p><p>made good on those suggestions.  "These guys are in this for </p><p>the long haul," she suggested, and "will not jeopardize their </p><p>position by picking a fight with the IMF."  (Note: Akyurek\'s </p><p>boss, Global Chairman Mehmet Kutman, also falls in this </p><p>"optimist" camp.  In a recent mailing, he effusively </p><p>characterized the AK government as "young, hardworking, and </p><p>highly disciplined," suggesting that for the first time in </p><p>"recent memory" it offered Turkey "the possibility of </p><p>government in the spirit of public service.") </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Iraq: For Istanbul\'s market analysts, Iraq remains the </p><p>new key wildcard.  Most ascribe recent market dynamics to </p><p>increasing concern about the prospects for imminent military </p><p>action, and the potential costs Turkey will face.  Drawing on </p><p>the experience of the Gulf War, some studies estimate the </p><p>potential impact on Turkey in the tens of billions of </p><p>dollars.  (A recent-- albeit seriously flawed-- study by the </p><p>Foreign Economic Relations Board estimated Turkey\'s losses at </p><p>15-20 billion dollars).  Analysts admit that the issue cuts </p><p>both ways, however.  In his recent letter, Kutman conceded </p><p>that the costs of an operation "will be very much outweighed </p><p>by the benefit...of having a stable and democratic government </p><p>in Iraq."  Zapparoli echoed these sentiments, while Akyurek </p><p>also saw a safety net in the market\'s belief that given </p><p>Turkey\'s strategic importance, neither the U.S. nor the IMF </p><p>would permit it to fail. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Comment: Despite their disappointment, Turkey\'s </p><p>markets have reacted calmly to the Copenhagen decision.  But </p><p>at the same time, they have taken off the rose-colored </p><p>glasses through which they filtered all other developments. </p><p>With increasing uncertainty surrounding Iraq, and growing </p><p>concerns about government policy, markets are likely in for a </p><p>bumpy ride until the former situation is resolved, one way or </p><p>another, and until the government imposes more discipline in </p><p>conveying its economic message.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ARNETT </p><p></p></div>
