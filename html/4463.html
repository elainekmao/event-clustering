<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 008534 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EUR/SE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/22/2007 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MARR, PHUM, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: ARTICLE 98: GOT SAYS NEGOTIATIONS LIKELY EARLY IN </p><p>2003 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 7591 AND PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Acting Polcouns Nicholas S. Kass.  Reason: </p><p>1.5(b)(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Feza Ozturk, head of the MFA International Political </p><p>Organizations Department, told Poloff November 21 that the </p><p>GOT would likely be prepared to negotiate an Article 98 </p><p>agreement with the USG following the December 12-13 EU Summit </p><p>in Copenhagen.  Ozturk said the GOT is wary of raising the </p><p>profile of the issue while the EU considers Turkey\'s </p><p>membership application, emphasizing that the USG should </p><p>not/not make any public comments before the Summit about the </p><p>GOT\'s willingness to reach an agreement.  Ozturk said the MFA </p><p>at the Undersecretary level had decided to support an Article </p><p>98 agreement, and had sent a letter to the Turkish General </p><p>Staff (TGS) seeking its support.  Ozturk said he would inform </p><p>the Embassy of the TGS response, which he predicted would be </p><p>favorable. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Poloff observed that an Article 98 agreement should </p><p>not affect Turkey\'s EU bid, particularly because the EU FMs </p><p>at the September 30 GAC had given a green light for EU </p><p>members to reach bilateral Article 98 agreements with the </p><p>U.S., under certain guidelines.  Ozturk said the issue had </p><p>unfortunately been politicized by the press, which would </p><p>interpret a pre-Summit Article 98 agreement by the GOT as a </p><p>slight to the EU.  He said he was confident an agreement </p><p>could be reached quickly after the Summit. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
