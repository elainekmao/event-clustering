Also all funds and economic resources belonging to, </p><p>or owned by or held by former president Saddam Hussein, </p><p>senior officials of his regime, immediate members of their </p><p>families or any legal persons or entities owned or </p><p>controlled by these persons should be frozen. </p><p>This EU-regulation has now the force of law in the </p><p>Netherlands. All financial institutions in the Netherlands </p><p>will be informed by the financial supervisors of the new </p><p>regulations. </p><p> </p><p>(SBU) Funds and economic resources that are frozen pursuant </p><p>to the EU-regulation mentioned above shall only be unfrozen </p><p>for the purpose of their transfer to the Development Fund of </p><p>Iraq, under the conditions set out in UNSCR 1483 (2003). </p><p>Before funds and other economic resources can be transferred </p><p>they will have to be confiscated. At this moment, according </p><p>to Dutch law, confiscation of (any) funds is only possible </p><p>after a criminal conviction. In order to be able to </p><p>confiscate and transfer funds to the Development Fund of </p><p>Iraq, new legislation will be drafted which will enable us </p><p>to confiscate funds and resources without a conviction of </p><p>the owners of the funds. </p><p> </p><p>END TEXT OF LETTER </p><p> </p><p>Russel </p><p></p></div>
