<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 001246 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/18/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MOPS, MASS, LI, NI, ECOWAS </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: ABUBAKAR ON ECOWAS LIBERIA FORCE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) ABUJA 1210 </p><p>     (B) ABUJA 1211 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER; REASONS 1.5 </p><p>(B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY: During a July 12 meeting with </p><p>Assistant Secretary for African Affairs Kansteiner, </p><p>former Nigerian Head of State General Abdulsalaam </p><p>Abubakar discussed the proposed deployment of an </p><p>ECOWAS force and the establishment of a transitional </p><p>government in Liberia.  Abubakar said Nigerian BG </p><p>Festus Okwonko had been named the Force Commander and </p><p>that Nigeria could field two battalions on short </p><p>notice.  Abubakar said 3,000 of the desired 5,000-man </p><p>force would come from ECOWAS members with Nigeria, </p><p>Ghana and Mali shouldering most of the load in the </p><p>beginning and Senegal possibly contributing to the </p><p>force after the initial deployment.  He hoped the </p><p>remaining 2,000 soldiers would come from contributions </p><p>from the United States, South Africa and/or Morocco. </p><p>Abubakar thought that Taylor should leave Monrovia </p><p>within the next one-two weeks, lest Taylor start </p><p>obfuscating and the LURD resume fighting.  Abubakar </p><p>was also concerned that, to prevent chaos, </p><p>peacekeepers should deploy before Taylor leaves. </p><p>Abubakar and A/S Kansteiner discussed a Taylor </p><p>departure simultaneous with the arrival of the </p><p>peacekeeping force as a possible course of action. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) During a July 12 meeting with Assistant </p><p>Secretary for African Affairs Walter Kansteiner, </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>former Nigerian Head of State General Abudulsalaam </p><p>Abubakar discussed deployment of an ECOWAS force to </p><p>Liberia.  Abubakar said Nigerian BG Festus Okwonko </p><p>would be the Force Commander.  Okwonko planned to </p><p>accompany Abubakar to Accra the afternoon of July 12. </p><p>(NOTE: Abubakar indicated Okwonko had served with </p><p>ECOMOG forces in Liberia.  He was most recently </p><p>assigned to the Command and Staff College in Jaji and </p><p>was formerly the Nigerian DATT in Addis Ababa.  END </p><p>NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Abubakar thought ECOWAS could eventually field </p><p>3,000 of a desired 5,000-man force.  Nigeria, Ghana </p><p>and Mali would furnish most of the troops while </p><p>Senegal and others were expected to make smaller </p><p>contributions once the initial force was already on </p><p>the ground.  Abubakar expected the remaining 2,000 to </p><p>come from the United States, South Africa and Morocco. </p><p>He had not yet heard whether South Africa or Morocco </p><p>would participate.  He indicated that ECOWAS forces </p><p>would require significant logistical support from the </p><p>U.S. or other donor countries.  Abubakar said the </p><p>Liberians wanted the U.S. to lead the mission and that </p><p>it was essential to deploy forces to Monrovia </p><p>immediately. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) A/S Kansteiner emphasized that President Bush </p><p>had not yet decided whether to deploy American troops </p><p>and that we were still considering the full range of </p><p>policy options on Liberia - from financial assistance </p><p>only to full troop deployment.  A/S Kansteiner </p><p>commented that, should Taylor step aside and if a </p><p>decision to commit troops were taken, the quickest the </p><p>U.S. could deploy would be on or about August 1. </p><p>Abubakar gave a time-table of a week or two for </p><p>Taylor\'s departure.  Waiting any longer, he felt, </p><p>could further destabilize the situation - Taylor might </p><p>start playing tricks and the LURD would not remain </p><p>bridled.  Thus, it was imperative that some force get </p><p>on the ground quickly.  Kansteiner asked whether a </p><p>quickly deployed but small ECOWAS force would be </p><p>challenged by the LURD, MODEL and perhaps the GOL. </p><p>Abubakar acknowledged that possibility but felt that </p><p>the potential consequences of not deploying would be </p><p>greater. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Abubakar was dismayed that the ECOWAS Joint </p><p>Verification Team (JVT) was stuck in Freetown and had </p><p>not yet visited Monrovia.  With UNAMSIL\'s refusal to </p><p>provide lift for the JVT and uncertainty over </p><p>Nigeria\'s ability to do so, it was unclear when the </p><p>JVT would be deployed.  A/S Kansteiner and Abubakar </p><p>agreed the JVT was important for both logistical and </p><p>symbolic reasons and that it must complete its mission </p><p>before any ECOWAS force could go to Liberia. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Responding with concern to A/S Kansteiner\'s </p><p>assertion that Taylor\'s departure was a prerequisite </p><p>to any possible U.S. troop deployment, Abubakar </p><p>worried that anti-Taylor sentiments had grown so </p><p>strong that the cease-fire might break down if a force </p><p>were not deployed soon.  A/S Kansteiner asked whether </p><p>a simultaneous Taylor departure/U.S. troop arrival was </p><p>a tenable solution;  Abubakar felt this concept might </p><p>present a way forward. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Abubakar did not think it necessary for the </p><p>peace process to address the fate of members of </p><p>Taylor\'s cadre who also fear indictment by the Special </p><p>Court for Sierra Leone.  He said that extracting </p><p>Taylor quickly would calm the situation and open the </p><p>door to working other problems.  Responding to </p><p>Kansteiner\'s concerns about recent LURD threats </p><p>against peacekeepers should any deploy before Taylor\'s </p><p>departure, Abubakar said such statements were worrying </p><p>and that he had been counseling the LURD to desist. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) On the transitional government, Abubakar </p><p>emphasized the importance of maintaining the </p><p>constitutionality of the transfer of power upon </p><p>Taylor\'s departure.  He stated that Taylor should hand </p><p>power to Vice President Blah or to whomever he </p><p>selects, such as Roland Massaquoi, to replace Blah as </p><p>Vice President.  That Vice President, in turn, should </p><p>step aside in favor of an interim government by </p><p>October 2003.  The interim government would be charged </p><p>with beginning the demobilization process and </p><p>preparing for elections in October 2004.  Abubakar </p><p>agreed with A/S Kansteiner that the transitional </p><p>government should be led by an experienced and </p><p>respected civil servant.  He also commented that he </p><p>had told LURD and MODEL leaders they should not expect </p><p>a place in the transitional government if they intend </p><p>to seek office in the October 2004 election. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. COMMENT: After having sat around the table for many </p><p>hours with LURD and GOL representatives, Abubakar\'s </p><p>main concern is the prompt removal of Taylor. </p><p>Abubakar had gauged the LURD\'s patience and </p><p>presciently found it to be wanting.  Abubakar sensed </p><p>that the cease-fire would not hold much longer if </p><p>Taylor\'s departure remains more promissory than </p><p>definite.  Because he has probably spent more time </p><p>recently with the LURD than anyone else, his </p><p>observations are credible and should continue to </p><p>inform our thinking.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
