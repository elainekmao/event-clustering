<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ROME 001918 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/15/2012 </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  01918  01 OF 02  171715Z </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PREL, IT, NATO, ITNATO </p><p>SUBJECT: U/S GROSSMAN DELEGATION CONSULTS WITH ITALIAN </p><p>OFFICIALS ON PRAGUE SUMMIT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: ACTING DCM MARGARET DEAN FOR REASONS 1.5(B), (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY.  THE GOI AGREES THAT THE PRAGUE SUMMIT SHOULD </p><p>BE A SUBSTANTIVE MEETING THAT COVERS MORE THAN JUST NATO </p><p>ENLARGEMENT.  MEETING WITH U/S GROSSMAN AND HIS DELEGATION IN </p><p>ROME ON APRIL 16, SENIOR ITALIAN OFFICIALS ENDORSED THE IDEA </p><p>OF REDEFINING THE DEFENSE CAPABILITIES INITIATIVE TO FOCUS ON </p><p>A FEW ACHIEVABLE PRIORITIES, EXPRESSED INTEREST IN THE </p><p>UNIFIED COMMAND PLAN\'S IMPACT ON NATO, AGREED THAT PRAGUE </p><p>WOULD PRESENT AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONSIDER HIGH READINESS FORCE </p><p>HEADQUARTERS DETAILS, AND DISCUSSED NATO-RUSSIA RELATIONS. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>NEW CAPABILITIES </p><p>---------------- </p><p>2. (C) U/S GROSSMAN\'S DELEGATION REVIEWED U.S. GOALS FOR THE </p><p>NATO SUMMIT IN PRAGUE WITH SENIOR MFA AND MOD OFFICIALS IN </p><p>ROME ON APRIL 16. THE ITALIAN DELEGATION, HEADED BY MFA </p><p>SECRETARY GENERAL BALDOCCI, INCLUDED MFA POLITICAL DIRECTOR </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>ARAGONA, VICE CHOD CAMPORINI, MOD DIPLOMATIC ADVISOR GRECO, </p><p>MFA MINISTER FOR SECURITY AFFAIRS PENSA, AND MFA NATO OFFICE </p><p>DIRECTOR BRAUZZI.  ON NEW CAPABILITIES, BALDOCCI, ARAGONA, </p><p>AND GEN. CAMPORINI AGREED THAT INTRODUCING A NEW, MORE </p><p>FOCUSED CAPABILITIES INITIATIVE AT PRAGUE WOULD BE </p><p>CONSTRUCTIVE.  CAMPORINI NOTED THAT ITALY\'S LIMITED DEFENSE </p><p>FUNDS HAVE BEEN WISELY INVESTED IN PROGRAMS THAT ARE PAYING </p><p>OFF, SUCH AS THE ADDITION OF LIFT CAPACITY WITH THE PURCHASE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01918  01 OF 02  171715Z </p><p>OF 24 C130JS. HE SUGGESTED THAT NATO EXAMINE THE CAPABILITIES </p><p>OF A NEW COMMUNICATIONS SATELLITE PROJECT THAT COULD MEET </p><p>SOME ALLIED REQUIREMENTS WITHOUT EXCESSIVE COST (LESS THAN </p><p>$500 MILLION FROM DESIGN TO OPERATION). </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) CAMPORINI EXPRESSED SOME DOUBTS ABOUT POOLING FORCES </p><p>AND RESOURCES UNTIL THE POLITICAL ISSUES HAVE BEEN RESOLVED. </p><p>SHARING CAPABILITIES BETWEEN NATO AND THE EU IS AN IMPORTANT </p><p>PREREQUISITE TO ANY COOPERATIVE POOLING EFFORT, HE SAID. </p><p>ESDP MUST COMPLEMENT NATO, AND NATO FORCES MUST BE AVAILABLE </p><p>FOR ALL POSSIBLE REQUIREMENTS.  U/S GROSSMAN EMPHASIZED THAT </p><p>THE US WANTS ESDP TO SUCCEED BUT IS CONCERNED THAT THE EU MAY </p><p>FAIL TO FULFILL THE HEADLINE GOAL BY 2003.  U/S GROSSMAN </p><p>URGED THE EU TO RESOLVE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN GREECE AND </p><p>TURKEY AND COMPLETE THE BERLIN PLUS PROCESS SO THAT ESDP CAN </p><p>MOVE FORWARD.  BEFORE THE QUESTION OF NATO\'S FUTURE ROLE CAN </p><p>TRULY BE ADDRESSED, THE ALLIANCE NEEDS TO BE MORE BALANCED IN </p><p>TERMS OF MILITARY CAPABILITIES, U/S GROSSMAN SAID. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  DISCUSSION IN PRAGUE OF THE HRF HEADQUARTERS WOULD BE </p><p>USEFUL, ACCORDING TO CAMPORINI.  THE HRF CANDIDACY PROCESS, </p><p>WHICH PITTED NATO COUNTRIES AGAINST ONE ANOTHER IN AN </p><p>EXPENSIVE EXERCISE, WAS NOT CONSTRUCTIVE, HE ADDED.  NOW THAT </p><p>WE HAVE SIX NATO ELEMENTS, WE NEED TO DECIDE WHAT TO DO WITH </p><p>THEM.  HE ENDORSED A RECENT BRITISH IDEA OF PAIRING UP HRF </p><p>COMMANDS.  WHILE THIS MAY RESULT IN A REDUNDANCY OF </p><p>RESOURCES, CAMPORINI SAID IT COULD BE AN ACCEPTABLE SOLUTION. </p><p>ITALY SUPPORTS A MORE RATIONAL APPROACH TO CAOC\'S AND JOC\'S, </p><p>CAMPORINI SAID, ALTHOUGH THE GOI IS NOT IN A POSITION TO </p><p>START THE DISCUSSION ON RATIONALIZING THESE COMMANDS.  ONCE </p><p>THE DISCUSSION IS UNDERWAY, ITALY IS WILLING TO PARTICIPATE, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01918  01 OF 02  171715Z </p><p>AND IS EVEN PREPARED TO MAKE SACRIFICES THAT WOULD IMPROVE </p><p>THE EFFICIENCY OF THE ALLIANCE. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  BALDOCCI AND OTHER KEY DELEGATION MEMBERS EXPRESSED </p><p>PARTICULAR INTEREST IN THE FUTURE OF SACLANT AND SACEUR UNDER </p><p>THE NEW UCP.  THEY URGED THAT MAJOR NATO COMMANDERS REMAIN </p><p>DOUBLE-HATTED, WITH BOTH A NATO AND A SIGNIFICANT US COMMAND. </p><p> FROM THE ALLIES\' POINT OF VIEW, HE SAID, THIS IS AN </p><p>IMPORTANT LINK THAT SHOULD BE PRESERVED BECAUSE OF THE STRONG </p><p>MESSAGE IT SENDS. </p><p> </p><p>NEW MEMBERS </p><p>----------- </p><p>6. (C) THE ITALIANS AGREED THAT ALBANIA AND MACEDONIA ARE NOT </p><p>READY FOR NATO MEMBERSHIP BUT SHOULD FEEL THE ENLARGEMENT </p><p>PROCESS IS FAIR.  BALDOCCI NOTED THAT POLITICAL CIRCUMSTANCES </p><p>MAY IMPACT ENLARGEMENT BUT REITERATED THAT A GEOSTRATEGIC </p><p>BALANCE IS AN ESSENTIAL PREREQUISITE FOR ITALY.  PRIME </p><p>MINISTER BERLUSCONI WILL PUBLICLY EXPRESS ITALY\'S SUPPORT FOR </p><p>MEMBERSHIP FOR BULGARIA AND ROMANIA DURING HIS STOPS IN SOFIA </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ4902 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  01918  02 OF 02  171715Z </p><p>ACTION P-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   CIAE-00  SRPP-00  EUR-00   VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00 </p><p>      INR-00   L-00     AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OMB-01   PA-00 </p><p>      PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   SP-00    SSO-00   SS-00    TRSE-00 </p><p>      T-00     USIE-00  PMB-00   DRL-02   G-00     SAS-00     /005W </p><p>                  ------------------879BC3  171715Z /45 </p><p>O 171456Z APR 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 3312 </p><p>INFO NATO EU COLLECTIVE IMMEDIATE </p><p>AMEMBASSY BRATISLAVA IMMEDIATE </p><p>AMEMBASSY BUCHAREST IMMEDIATE </p><p>AMEMBASSY KIEV IMMEDIATE </p><p>AMEMBASSY LJUBLJANA IMMEDIATE </p><p>AMEMBASSY MOSCOW IMMEDIATE </p><p>AMEMBASSY RIGA IMMEDIATE </p><p>AMEMBASSY SKOPJE IMMEDIATE </p><p>AMEMBASSY SOFIA IMMEDIATE </p><p>AMEMBASSY TALLINN IMMEDIATE </p><p>AMEMBASSY TIRANA IMMEDIATE </p><p>AMEMBASSY VILNIUS IMMEDIATE </p><p>AMEMBASSY ZAGREB IMMEDIATE </p><p>SECDEF WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>JOINT STAFF WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 ROME 001918 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/15/2012 </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  01918  02 OF 02  171715Z </p><p>TAGS: NATO, PREL, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: U/S GROSSMAN DELEGATION CONSULTS WITH ITALIAN </p><p>OFFICIALS ON PRAGUE SUMMIT </p><p> </p><p>AND BUCHAREST ON APRIL 17 AND 18, THEY SAID, BUT HE WILL ALSO </p><p>ENCOURAGE THOSE COUNTRIES TO CONTINUE WITH NEEDED REFORMS TO </p><p>REACH NATO STANDARDS.  ON SLOVAKIA, U/S GROSSMAN AND DAS </p><p>BRADTKE EXPLAINED THAT FUNDING NGO EFFORTS TO GET THE VOTE </p><p>OUT MAY BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE AND LEAST INTRUSIVE WAY TO HELP </p><p>SLOVAKIA PRESERVE ITS MEMBERSHIP POSSIBILITIES. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) ARAGONA AND BALDOCCI STRESSED THE IMPORTANCE OF </p><p>PROTECTING THE INTEGRITY OF THE NATO MILITARY STRUCTURE, </p><p>INCLUDING COLLECTIVE DECISION-MAKING.  FRAGMENTATION COULD BE </p><p>A SERIOUS BLOW TO THE WHOLE STRUCTURE, HE WARNED.  THEY </p><p>AGREED THAT ENLARGEMENT WILL PRESENT OTHER ISSUES SUCH AS THE </p><p>NEED TO CREATE A MECHANISM TO SUSPEND OR EXPEL NATO MEMBERS </p><p>AS THE COHERENCE OF THE ALLIANCE IS DILUTED.  THIS HAS BEEN </p><p>SOMEWHAT CONTROVERSIAL IN EUROPEAN DEBATES, ARAGONA SAID, BUT </p><p>IS AN IDEA ITALY COULD SUPPORT. </p><p> </p><p>NEW RELATIONSHIPS </p><p>----------------- </p><p>8. (C) WHEN ASKED ABOUT RUSSIA\'S POSITION ON MEMBERSHIP FOR </p><p>THE BALTICS, U/S GROSSMAN EMPHASIZED THAT ONE REASON FOR </p><p>HOLDING A NATO-RUSSIA SUMMIT IN ROME IN LATE MAY IS TO HELP </p><p>PRESIDENT PUTIN NEUTRALIZE OPPOSITION TO ENLARGEMENT.  ITALY, </p><p>ALONG WITH OTHER ALLIES, WILL NEED TO ENSURE THAT THE MAY </p><p>SUMMIT IN ROME RESOLVES RUSSIA\'S PUBLIC OPINION PROBLEMS SO </p><p>THAT THESE WILL NOT INTERFERE WITH THE PRAGUE SUMMIT.  DAS </p><p>BRADTKE SUGGESTED THAT ENCOURAGING THE BALTICS TO STATE THAT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01918  02 OF 02  171715Z </p><p>THEY WOULD LIKE TO JOIN CFE WHEN POSSIBLE MAY ALSO HELP PUTIN </p><p>WITH RUSSIAN PUBLIC PERCEPTIONS ON ENLARGEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>9.
