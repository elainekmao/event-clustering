End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) On April 4, King Gyanendra addressed thousands at a </p><p>civic reception in Dhangadhi in Nepal\'s far-west.  This is </p><p>the second public event since the King\'s coronation; the </p><p>first was reported reftel.  The King\'s brief remarks </p><p>highlighted the importance of the monarchy as an institution, </p><p>the need for good governance to achieve development, and his </p><p>commitment to representative multiparty democracy.  In a </p><p>pointed statement to political parties and the Maoists, he </p><p>called on them to "contribute in earnest to make the peace </p><p>process a success" and not to stand against the popular will </p><p>of the Nepali people for peace.  In statements directed at </p><p>the international community, the King requested the political </p><p>parties to support the interim cabinet, arguing that "the </p><p>international community has begun to place their faith in </p><p>Nepal and its governance due to the improvement in the </p><p>country\'s general condition."  Unlike the monarch\'s first </p><p>address, where political parties criticized the expense and </p><p>tried to paint the civic program as an attempt to sideline </p><p>them, there was little positive or negative publicity </p><p>surrounding the latest speech. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Comment:  The King\'s speech, the second in a series </p><p>of carefully staged "public outreach" events, was crafted to </p><p>resonate with domestic audiences weary of the long insurgency </p><p>and grateful for the respite provided by the cease-fire.  By </p><p>calling on the Maoists and the political parties together to </p><p>"contribute to peace," the King signaled that he considers </p><p>each equally important--and potentially obstructive--to </p><p>progress towards peace.  The speech also co-opted many of the </p><p>Maoist themes for a "new Nepal" and "true democracy," placing </p><p>them in a framework that does not require radical change of </p><p>the constitution, as envisaged by the Maoists. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
