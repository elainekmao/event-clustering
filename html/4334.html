<p>UNCLAS KATHMANDU 002169 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS AND DS/IP/SA </p><p>STATE ALSO PASS USAID/DCHA/OFDA </p><p>MANILA FOR USAID/DCHA/OFDA </p><p>LONDON FOR POL - RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PGOV, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL:  MAOISTS LAUNCH SIMULTANEOUS ATTACKS ON </p><p>DISTRICT HEADQUARTERS, POLICE POST </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) At about midnight November 15, Maoist insurgents </p><p>launched an attack on the headquarters in Jumla District in </p><p>northwestern Nepal.  Communications with the headquarters </p><p>were cut immediately after the attack, and accurate </p><p>information remains difficult to obtain.  Initial reports </p><p>indicate that four soldiers and 33 policemen, including the </p><p>Deputy Superintendent of Police, were killed, and another 13 </p><p>soldiers and 9 policemen wounded.  A seven-man detachment </p><p>from the National Intelligence Division (NID), as well as the </p><p>Chief District Officer (CDO), have been reported missing. </p><p>Local government buildings, including the office of the Chief </p><p>District Officer (CDO), were reportedly burned or otherwise </p><p>damaged.  The Maoists succeeded in stealing nearly a third of </p><p>the police\'s arsenal of weapons, as well as more than USD </p><p>45,000 in cash and gold from a local bank.  There are no </p><p>estimates of Maoist casualties. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  According to an RNA source, the Maoists overran </p><p>the 200-man police station, using 81 mm mortars and 2-inch </p><p>mortars.  Initial attempts by the Royal Nepal Army (RNA) to </p><p>dispatch reinforcements to the site were unsuccessful, </p><p>reportedly because of snowy weather conditions in the remote, </p><p>mountainous district.  RNA troops have since been sent to </p><p>reinforce the garrison, and have begun cordon and search </p><p>operations in the area to capture the attackers.  The RNA </p><p>source reported that some of the fleeing insurgents ran into </p><p>an RNA blocking position, but had no figures on potential </p><p>casualties from that encounter. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  Also at midnight November 15, Maoist insurgents </p><p>attacked a remote police post, located approximately 260 km </p><p>by road from Jumla, in Tarkakot in Gorkha District in </p><p>north-central Nepal.  Of the 55 policemen on duty at the time </p><p>of the attack, at least 23 were killed and 10 injured. </p><p>Police Headquarters reported the attackers made off with </p><p>nearly all of the weapons (.303 rifles) from the post. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  Comment:  Unlike earlier attacks on district </p><p>headquarters in Achham (February) and Arghakhanchi </p><p>(September), the Maoists this time failed to overrun the RNA </p><p>position.   These latest attacks on government forces belie </p><p>Maoist rhetoric claiming the insurgents are ready for </p><p>dialogue.  Sources close to the Maoists report they feel they </p><p>have the upper hand in the field.  If the Maoists are indeed </p><p>serious about negotiations--and many observers doubt that </p><p>they are--they are hoping to negotiate from a position of </p><p>strength. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
