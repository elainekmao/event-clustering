<p>UNCLAS KATHMANDU 000255 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS </p><p>E.O. 12958:    N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, NP, Human Rights </p><p>SUBJECT: ICRC RESUMES VISITS TO KATHMANDU JAILS </p><p> </p><p>REF:  KATHMANDU 0088 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  According to International Committee of the </p><p>Red Cross (ICRC) Head Delegate Jean-Jacques Bovay, on </p><p>January 30 the Government of Nepal (GON) began allowing </p><p>ICRC access to prisoners for the first time since the </p><p>November 26 imposition of a state of national emergency. </p><p>Bovay said that his organization has registered 62 </p><p>prisoners at two Kathmandu jails, including the district </p><p>police station at Hanuman Dhoka, and expressed </p><p>confidence that his organization will soon regain its </p><p>previous unfettered access to jails throughout the </p><p>country.  Bovay thanked the Embassy and the USG for </p><p>pressing the Government of Nepal (GON) to ensure </p><p>confidential ICRC access to prisoners despite the </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>emergency. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  Comment:  Following November 26, the Embassy </p><p>and other USG visitors have on a number of occasions </p><p>reminded our GON interlocutors--including the Prime </p><p>Minister and the Chief of Army Staff--of their country\'s </p><p>international treaty obligations to allow ICRC access to </p><p>prisoners.  Each time we were assured-- most recently </p><p>during the January 18-19 visit of the Secretary of State- </p><p>-that resumed access would soon be forthcoming.  We will </p><p>follow up with the ICRC to ensure that visits to jails </p><p>outside of Kathmandu resume as well. </p><p> </p><p>Malinowski </p><p></p></div>
