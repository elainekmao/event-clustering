He was immediately subdued </p><p>and handcuffed by sky marshals on board. </p><p> </p><p>-- Immediately thereafter, another passenger closer to the </p><p>back of the airplane stood up and made the same claim.  He </p><p>was also immediately subdued and handcuffed by the sky </p><p>marshals.  The plane landed safely in Abu Dhabi at 3:40 a.m. </p><p> </p><p>-- The aircraft landed in Abu Dhabi and the two were taken </p><p>off.  They were identified as "Muhammad Ali Hussein" and </p><p>"Abdul Nasser Farraj."  They were identified as Libyan </p><p>nationals and taken into custody by Abu Dhabi authorities. </p><p>Both had boarded in Amman as transit passengers originating </p><p>in Tripoli, Libya (Tripoli-Amman-Abu Dhabi). </p><p> </p><p>-- The Abu Dhabi authorities searched the plane and luggage </p><p>thoroughly and found nothing suspicious.
