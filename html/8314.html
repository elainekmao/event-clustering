<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 003487 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/28/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY: MFA D/U/S ILKIN\'S MAY 27 CYPRUS BRIEFING </p><p>TO ANKARA DIPLOMATIC CORPS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 3412 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by DCM Robert S. Deutsch.  Reason:1.5(b)(d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: MFA Deputy U/S Baki Ilkin briefed </p><p>representatives of EU and Permfive countries May 27 regarding </p><p>GOT  and "TRNC" efforts to reinvigorate the Cyprus process. </p><p>Ilkin asserted that decisions by "TRNC" leader Denktas and </p><p>the GOT allowing Greek Cypriots to visit the north and the </p><p>Turkish mainland are helping to improve the atmosphere on the </p><p>island.  He volunteered, however, that such steps do little </p><p>directly to ameliorate the core disputes between Greek- and </p><p>Turkish Cypriots on issues including territory, restitution, </p><p>and Greek Cypriot right of return to the north.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Ilkin noted at the outset that in the aftermath of the </p><p>latest, unsuccessful round of UN-sponsored Cyprus talks, all </p><p>sides needed to bridge the widening "confidence gap."  As a </p><p>result, at Denktas\'s initiative, the "TRNC" decided last </p><p>month to allow Greek Cypriots to visit their former homes in </p><p>the north, a move matched by the GOT\'s decision to permit </p><p>Greek Cypriot tourism in Turkey.  According to Ilkin, some </p><p>300 thousand Greek Cypriots have taken advantage of the move </p><p>to see the north; some 150 thousand Turkish Cypriots have </p><p>visited the south.  Currently, Greek- and Turkish Cypriots </p><p>are crossing the border at rates of up to six thousand and </p><p>three thousand per week, respectively.  Some 1,000 Turkish </p><p>Cypriots go south daily to work, he added.  The Greek Cypriot </p><p>side, Ilkin alleged, is trying to place some restrictions on </p><p>those visiting the north: any foodstuffs brought back from </p><p>Turkish Cyprus in excess of half a kilo can be confiscated at </p><p>the border; moreover, the Greek Cypriot Parliament is looking </p><p>at legislation to make it a criminal offense for any Greek </p><p>Cypriot to spend the night in the Turkish sector. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Ilkin noted that such measures, while helping to </p><p>improve the atmosphere on the island, "do not solve the </p><p>problem by themselves."  In that vein, the "TRNC" and the GOT </p><p>are willing to discuss the issues.  However, Ilkin said he </p><p>wanted to make it clear that: 1) the "TRNC," not/not the GOT, </p><p>will continue to be the Greek Cypriots\' interlocutor in any </p><p>talks; and 2) the UNSYG\'s Cyprus plan (Annan III) cannot be a </p><p>"basis" for further negotiations -- that would eliminate </p><p>"room for maneuver."  Instead, 3) the plan could serve as an </p><p>instruments to bridge the gaps; "elements" of the plan could </p><p>be salvaged and discussed if indeed this would be useful in </p><p>making progress.  If the plan were a "basis", preserving its </p><p>balance would leave too little space for negotiation between </p><p>the two sides.  Denktas and the GOT are willing to see a </p><p>negotiation of the two side\'s request for changes to the </p><p>plan.  "The problem is that the disagreement between the </p><p>sides is on the same four or five issues," Ilkin said.  This </p><p>makes compromise difficult.  Nonetheless the "TRNC" is </p><p>evaluating how to proceed, despite the Greek Cypriot </p><p>"pre-conditions" enumerated by President Papadopoulos </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Ilkin asserted that lifting the embargo on the "TRNC" </p><p>was key to establishing increased confidence to underpin </p><p>future negotiations. He noted that the EU was considering a </p><p>package toward this end, but said the GOT was withholding </p><p>judgment pending: 1) the actual publication of the package </p><p>and 2) Denktas\' evaluation of it. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) During the Q and A segment, several EU diplomats urged </p><p>the GOT to act with dispatch to get the process moving again, </p><p>noting that there is not all that much time until Cyprus </p><p>officially joins the EU next May; it will shortly again </p><p>become a fish-or-cut-bait situation.  UK Ambassador </p><p>Westmacott observed that by not accepting Annan III as the </p><p>"basis" of negotiations, it appeared the GOT is trying to </p><p>start again from scratch.  This he said, would only doom the </p><p>Cyprus process to failure again.  Ilkin demurred with an arch </p><p>joke, saying that he "knows how to play softball and </p><p>hardball." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Comment: Ilkin\'s briefing reflected the GOT stance </p><p>reported reftel, but did little to advance the prospects for </p><p>a Cyprus settlement process that gets back on track quickly. </p><p>End comment. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
