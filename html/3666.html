<p>UNCLAS HARARE 002060 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JFRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR CNEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAGR, ECON, PHUM, PGOV, ZI, Land Reform </p><p>SUBJECT: POLICE, MILITARY ENFORCE NEW, UNOFFICIAL FARM </p><p>EVICTION DEADLINE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary.  According to several reports received over the </p><p>weekend, the GOZ has purportedly issued directives from "the </p><p>highest levels" to both police and military to finalize the </p><p>removal of commercial farmers.  The Commercial Farmers Union </p><p>(CFU), merely a shadow of its former presence, as well as </p><p>Justice for Agriculture (JAG) and private sources report that </p><p>a new deadline was set for all farmers -- including farmers </p><p>who have had their notices of acquisition overturned in the </p><p>courts -- to vacate their property and homesteads by mid-day </p><p>on September 8.  Any farmer refusing to comply would be </p><p>arrested and any property remaining on the farms after this </p><p>date would be considered forfeited to the GOZ. Press reports </p><p>and eyewitness accounts report hundreds of farmers evacuating </p><p>their property.  No reports of violence or new arrests have </p><p>yet been received. End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. Reports received from various regions throughout the </p><p>country indicate that the GOZ is engaged in an intensified </p><p>effort to force all commercial farmers with any acquisition </p><p>notices -- whether preliminary or final -- off their land, </p><p>even those with pending judicial challenges.  One farmer </p><p>reported that the District Police chief advised him that the </p><p>orders were now "coming from the top" and that evictions were </p><p>to proceed regardless of court orders overruling the legality </p><p>of acquisition notices.  This police chief claimed that </p><p>Mugabe had mandated that there be a list of vacated </p><p>properties belonging to the 2900-plus targeted commercial </p><p>farmers on his desk by Monday morning.  This farmer further </p><p>reported that commercial farmers who wish to continue farming </p><p>are now being advised by their evictors to turn over their </p><p>title deeds to the GOZ, go in person to the Ministry of </p><p>Agriculture, and apply to be granted land in accordance with </p><p>the new farm size limits.  The farmer speculated that the GOZ </p><p>is attempting to capitalize on the optic of hundreds of white </p><p>commercial farmers standing in line for hours, hats in hand, </p><p>in order to be allocated a piece of land. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Another report from the Chiredzi area, in Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>southeastern corner, indicated that a local magistrate </p><p>publicly stated her sympathy with the farmers appearing </p><p>before her on charges of violating the acquisition orders, </p><p>and whose only crime was farming while attempting to </p><p>judicially defend their right to their property.  However, </p><p>this magistrate stated that she was under "immense political </p><p>pressure" from the governor.  She further indicated that she </p><p>could not change bail conditions or dismiss the cases without </p><p>permission from the Lands Ministry, which of course was not </p><p>sympathetic.  The magistrate postponed the cases, but the </p><p>prosecutor was informed that he would have to issue a </p><p>subpoena or summons to the relevant ministry to ensure that a </p><p>representative would be available on the court date.  The </p><p>farmers believed that the issue of summons/subpoena would be </p><p>used to continue their cases endlessly without reaching </p><p>resolution. </p><p> </p><p>4. Reports from Karoi, previously one of the more cohesive </p><p>farming regions holding out in the face of concerted GOZ </p><p>pressure, indicate that armed and uniformed police units as </p><p>well as armored military units have been a prominent feature </p><p>of the latest eviction push.  Some farmers continue to hold </p><p>fast and assert their right to challenge the GOZ\'s haphazard </p><p>implementation of land redistribution, which in many cases </p><p>does not even comply with the GOZ\'s own attempts to legalize </p><p>the proceedings.  Many more, however, are finally giving in, </p><p>packing up, and moving out.  As one farmer reported, there is </p><p>increasing tension on the ground as well as a belief that </p><p>farmers who resist the process -- even those who have been </p><p>granted judicial relief -- are now putting their lives, as </p><p>well as their property, at risk. </p><p> </p><p>5. Comment.  This latest eviction push follows closely on the </p><p>heels of Mugabe\'s triumphant speech upon his return from the </p><p>Johannesburg summit, in which he said white farmers should </p><p>comply with GOZ land redistribution, leave the country, or </p><p>face jail.  It is clear that a national directive was issued </p><p>shortly thereafter, as GOZ security services and local </p><p>officials appear to have communicated a uniform message to </p><p>commercial farmers nationwide that the September 8 deadline </p><p>would be enforced.  We are trying to get a more comprehensive </p><p>sense of how many farms are affected, but anecdotal evidence </p><p>at this stage suggests that we could be witnessing the end </p><p>game for Zimbabwe\'s white farmers.  End comment. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
