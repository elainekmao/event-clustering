<p>UNCLAS ANKARA 001499 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, EB AND EUR/SE </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA - MILLS AND LEICHTER </p><p>NSC FOR QUANRUD AND BRYZA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKISH ECONOMY MARCH 10:  AD REF AGREEMENT ON </p><p>LOI; MARKETS SERENE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) IMF ResRep advised this morning that Fund staff and </p><p>GOT officials had reached ad ref agreement on a Letter of </p><p>Intent, and that IMF Mission Chief had returned to Washington </p><p>with the draft.  We do not have details yet, but understand </p><p>from ResRep that the two sides reached a compromise agreement </p><p>on direct tax reform (based on a revised draft of the </p><p>legislation), and on reducing redundant positions in State </p><p>Enterprises (GOT agreed to pass decrees eliminating obstacles </p><p>to laying off SEE employees).  The GOT is still talking with </p><p>the World Bank about how to resolve the issue of direct </p><p>income payments to farmers in the budget, but Fund staff </p><p>apparently decided this should not be an obstacle to </p><p>proceeding. (Note:  World Bank Country Director Ajay Chhibber </p><p>was quoted in the press at mid-day today as saying the Bank </p><p>could not accept the budget, which he labeled "anti-poor," </p><p>and would not proceed with its planned $1.375 billion loan </p><p>unless the budget was changed.  End Note) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Fund staff hopes to work out some smaller issues </p><p>over the next 7-10 days via e-mail.  Then, the key question </p><p>will be enactment of the 2003 budget.  Finance Ministry and </p><p>Parliamentary sources told us today that the Planning and </p><p>Budget Commission is scheduled to complete work on the budget </p><p>on March 16.  The full Parliament could begin debate on the </p><p>budget as early as March 17.  This debate normally takes </p><p>10-11 days (i.e., approval around March 28), though the </p><p>government could make a political decision to limit debate in </p><p>hopes of enacting the budget sooner. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Markets remained calm this morning.  The lira </p><p>strengthened to TL 1,608 million/dollar in the interbank </p><p>market.  Yields on the benchmark 1/24/04 t-bill fell slightly </p><p>from 57.68 to 56.9, and the stock market rose 0.10 percent. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
