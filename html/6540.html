<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 001685 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NEA/PPA, NEA/ARN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/20/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, PGOV, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZ01. JORDANIAN STREET ON THE EVE OF WAR: </p><p>DESPONDENT, ANGRY, CYNICAL </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMBASSADOR EDWARD W. GNEHM.  REASONS:  1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY.  On the eve of likely coalition military </p><p>action against Iraq, the mood in Jordan is resigned to war, </p><p>but nevertheless very angry.  Although the street is </p><p>relatively quiet, EmbOffs\' conversations with Jordanians on </p><p>the subject of USG policy, while often beginning politely, </p><p>invariably result in emotional, angry responses that </p><p>aggressively question USG intentions in Iraq and the world in </p><p>general.  Media commentators are thrashing the USG and </p><p>President Bush, with one popular mainstream writer comparing </p><p>the President to Hitler (septel).  Jordanians are stocking up </p><p>on foodstuffs and gasoline, but not in quantities that are </p><p>resulting in shortages. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Even if military action in Iraq results in a good </p><p>outcome for Jordanians (and Iraqis), it is clear we have a </p><p>deep hole to dig out of if we intend to restore USG </p><p>credibility on the Jordanian street.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>THE ANGRY YOUTH OF JORDAN </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) On March 19, PolOff randomly engaged a group of </p><p>university students at a cafe in downtown Amman.  The group </p><p>consisted of 5 middle/lower-middle class undergraduates. </p><p>After brief pleasantries, the students began to express their </p><p>opinions.  As the students\' emotions grew, PolOff\'s responses </p><p>to their questions were often waved off or interrupted.  The </p><p>group basically sounded out three points on which they agree: </p><p> First, America has affronted the world (and confirmed its </p><p>intention to dominate the world) by ignoring and essentially </p><p>obliterating the authority of the UN Security Council. </p><p>Second, the USG, operating on selfish motives, is about to </p><p>invade a country which poses no realistic threat to it. </p><p>Third, the USG\'s support for Israel, in the face of </p><p>horrendous Arab/Palestinian suffering, leaves Arabs with no </p><p>reason to trust it, let alone support it in actions which </p><p>will likely lead to civilian casualties in Iraq.  "My brother </p><p>is in the West Bank, the Israelis shot him in the knee last </p><p>year.  I\'m very angry, and I don\'t have a lot of anger left </p><p>to focus against Saddam.  He\'s never done anything to hurt me </p><p>or my family," said one female student.  Another asked why </p><p>the USG has "done nothing" to Israel after the death of AMCIT </p><p>peace activist Rachel Corrie.  "Palestinians gave her more </p><p>respect than her own government did.  That\'s horrible," she </p><p>said.  Note:  The group was careful to distinguish between </p><p>Americans and the USG, and even drew a distinction between </p><p>the USG and the President, whom they universally viewed as a </p><p>"warmonger." </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>THE TWENTY SOMETHINGS </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) On March 19, PolOff met with a young, western-educated </p><p>public relations/internet technology professional in the same </p><p>cafe.  She seemed optimistic about what the war would do for </p><p>Jordan and its economy, and characterized Saddam "as a </p><p>madman."  But, she said, the result of the war, even if all </p><p>went well and Iraqis benefited, would leave the US with "zero </p><p>credibility" here.  "You have a long road to go to get to </p><p>where people here will believe the President over even a </p><p>random conspiracy theory on the internet."  In the past week, </p><p>even well-educated young adults have dissembled into </p><p>conspiracy theories on various reasons for the war, ranging </p><p>from a USG desire to destroy the Euro currency to an </p><p>irrational need for President Bush to avenge his father\'s </p><p>"failures".  It is nearly impossible to convince people that </p><p>USG intentions are in the interests of the Iraqi people. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>RESIGNED TO BOYCOTT - FOR NOW </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Despite the emotional anger against USG policy, most </p><p>people here appear resigned that "America is going to do what </p><p>it wants to do."  Most do not expect the street to "erupt," </p><p>although there are again calls for boycott, with several </p><p>Jordanians telling PolOff they have been receiving, and </p><p>forwarding, "numerous" SMS requests to boycott US goods. </p><p>EconOff received one such message from an unknown source </p><p>calling on "everyone" to begin worldwide boycotts against </p><p>American products as soon as the "U.S. invasion begins." </p><p>Note: while our American Chamber of Commerce contacts and </p><p>others in the business community expect to see local calls </p><p>for boycotts of American or "Zionist" products to continue, </p><p>we see no hard evidence of such campaigns materializing as of </p><p>yet. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>NO SHORTAGES ON ESSENTIALS </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Thus far, people are calmly preparing for possible </p><p>interruption of their daily lives.  "We\'ve been through this </p><p>before, this is the second gulf war," one Amman resident </p><p>said.  There appears to be an almost macho, defiant attitude </p><p>against stocking up in some circles.  Most people, however, </p><p>are purchasing essentials to get them through a period of </p><p>uncertainty. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Business community contacts in Zarqa (Jordan\'s second </p><p>largest city, about 20 miles northeast of Amman) confirm that </p><p>purchases of foodstuffs have increased in the past few days, </p><p>but note that current stocks and production capacities are </p><p>easily sufficient to accommodate increased consumption </p><p>levels.  They note that this increased consumption closely </p><p>followed Trade Minister Bashir\'s recent announcement that </p><p>food stocks were plentiful and Jordanians should not start </p><p>hoarding.  Remon Altalteh, owner of one of Zarqa\'s major </p><p>flour mills, confirmed orders have risen, but noted that </p><p>grain stocks are high and his mill is only doing half the </p><p>business it could handle.  Gasoline stations continue to do </p><p>normal business, with no evidence of queuing or hoarding of </p><p>fuel. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (C)  Jordanians are largely resigned to a likely war. </p><p>Scratch beneath the surface, however, and resignation turns </p><p>to serious anger and frustration towards the USG, </p><p>particularly in the younger crowd.  At the moment, the USG </p><p>has practically zero credibility with the young set, and its </p><p>credibility within the business community and some political </p><p>circles hinges on the social/political outcome of the war and </p><p>demonstrated progress (instead of "empty promises") on the </p><p>roadmap.  While positive results for the Iraqi and Jordanian </p><p>people will help restore some belief that the USG does harbor </p><p>good intentions, we expect skepticism and anger toward USG </p><p>policy to remain.  This skepticism may limit public GOJ </p><p>support for USG objectives, as they try to balance support </p><p>for us with sensitivity toward the highly charged emotions of </p><p>its people. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
