On July 31 Maoists agreed to sit for a third round of </p><p>formal peace talks with the Government of Nepal (GON). </p><p>Kamal Thapa, Information Minister and GON negotiating team </p><p>member, welcomed the decision but remained cautious, saying </p><p>that a date for a third round of talks would be set through </p><p>"mutual consultation."  Kofi Annan, UN Secretary General, </p><p>issued a statement on July 30 once again offering UN </p><p>assistance to Nepal to achieve a peaceful outcome. </p><p>According to July 25 press accounts, the Government of India </p><p>has voiced concern over reports that Maoists from Nepal are </p><p>forming ties with terrorist groups in India.  Maoist </p><p>leadership reportedly is under intense pressure from Maoist </p><p>cadres and international allies such as the Revolutionary </p><p>Internationalist Movement (RIM) to abandon dialogue and </p><p>return to all-out war.  Despite the continuing ceasefire and </p><p>in direct violation of the code of conduct, Maoists attacked </p><p>security forces, murdering three and injuring two.  The </p><p>insurgents continue to intensify extortion demands, severely </p><p>beating those who fail to comply.  Sher Bahadur Deuba, </p><p>President of the Nepali Congress (Democratic) and former </p><p>Prime Minister, accused the Maoists on July 25 of preparing </p><p>for war.  Maoists have threatened to punish severely anyone </p><p>who defies their orders to stop working with US affiliated </p><p>development and humanitarian organizations.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>GON ACCEDES TO MAOIST DEMANDS; </p><p>MAOISTS AGREE TO FURTHER PEACE TALKS </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  Timeline: </p><p> </p><p>---On July 23, Maoists responded to the GON\'s July 13 </p><p>invitation to sit for a third round of talks by setting new </p><p>preconditions (Ref A). </p><p> </p><p>---In its response on July 25, the GON addressed each of the </p><p>Maoists\' preconditions, declaring its continued commitment </p><p>to the peace process, and inviting the Maoists to sit for </p><p>talks by August 15.  The GON assured the Maoist leadership </p><p>that the GON\'s negotiating team has full legal authority to </p><p>make decisions, so there is no need for the King\'s direct </p><p>involvement; agreed to make public the whereabouts of over </p><p>three hundred Maoist cadres as soon as possible; and said it </p><p>is willing to release three central committee members.  The </p><p>GON refused to accept the controversial demand that the </p><p>Royal Nepal Army (RNA) be restricted to within five </p><p>kilometers of their barracks, explaining that "to restrict </p><p>and limit the responsibility and domain of the army would </p><p>not be in the broader interest of the country." </p><p> </p><p>---On July 27 Baburam Bhattarai, Maoist ideologue and head </p><p>of the Maoist negotiating team, issued an eight-page list of </p><p>ultimata, demanding that the GON fulfill their prerequisites </p><p>by July 31 or the Maoists would conclude that the GON has </p><p>"unilaterally dissolved the ceasefire and dialogue." </p><p> </p><p>---On July 29 the GON conceded several of the Maoists\' </p><p>demands, releasing three central committee members from </p><p>prison, and releasing information on thirty-six missing </p><p>Maoist cadres (Ref B).  The GON\'s quick response put </p><p>pressure on the Maoists not to walk away from the dialogue. </p><p>Minister Lohani said on July 30 that "now it is up to the </p><p>Maoists." </p><p> </p><p>---On the afternoon of July 31 Pushpa Kamal Dahal </p><p>(Prachanda), Maoist supreme leader, issued a statement that </p><p>the Maoists would sit for a third round of talks (Ref C) and </p><p>invited the political parties to be involved. </p><p> </p><p>GON CAUTIOUSLY WELCOMES MAOIST DECISION </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>3.  The GON welcomed the decision of the Maoists to sit for </p><p>a third round of talks, but warned, "we should not get too </p><p>excited."  Minister Thapa said the GON would proceed </p><p>carefully, and would try "every possible means" to involve </p><p>the political parties.  The GON had requested talks by mid- </p><p>August, but Thapa conceded that a date would be set through </p><p>"mutual consultation." </p><p> </p><p>UN SECRETARY GENERAL OFFERS ASSISTANCE </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  On July 30 Kofi Annan, UN Secretary General, issued a </p><p>statement expressing the UN\'s willingness to assist Nepal in </p><p>finding a peaceful solution to the current conflict. </p><p>Annan\'s statement praised the ceasefire and said the "UN </p><p>remains at the disposal of Nepal to assist in the </p><p>achievement of a negotiated peaceful solution."  Prakash </p><p>Chandra Lohani, Minister of Finance and member of the GON\'s </p><p>negotiating team, declared on July 27 that there was no need </p><p>for third-party mediators, reportedly saying, "this is our </p><p>internal matter and we are striving to resolve it." </p><p> </p><p>5.  Human rights organizations, political parties and </p><p>members of civil society have expressed the importance of </p><p>the GON and Maoists continuing with the peace dialogue.  The </p><p>National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) issued a statement </p><p>on July 29 urging both sides to sit immediately for a third </p><p>round of talks.  The NHRC also faulted the ongoing exchange </p><p>of letters for creating "misunderstandings" which </p><p>jeopardized the future of the peace talks. </p><p> </p><p>6.  Facilitators for the peace talks issued a joint </p><p>statement on July 29 appealing to both sides to sit for </p><p>direct talks, and to continue efforts to ensure the success </p><p>of the peace process.  The facilitators complained that the </p><p>"peace dialogue has not been disrupted but nothing </p><p>significant has been initiated."  The team reportedly also </p><p>opined that rigid stands by both the GON and the Maoists had </p><p>pushed the peace talks into a "critical stage," but were </p><p>still confident the next round of talks would take place. </p><p> </p><p>7.  In separate statements on July 30, leaders from Nepal\'s </p><p>major political parties reportedly have warned against a </p><p>return to violence, saying the people of Nepal would not </p><p>accept any action that pushed the country to further </p><p>violence.  Girija Prasad Koirala, President of the Nepali </p><p>Congress (NC), reportedly called it "inappropriate" for the </p><p>Maoists to issue an ultimatum during a time of uncertainty. </p><p>Koirala also declared that the Maoists should hold talks </p><p>with the political parties if they were not satisfied with </p><p>the GON.  Committee members from the Communist Party of </p><p>Nepal-United Marxist Leninist (CPN-UML) said the GON\'s </p><p>willingness to fulfill some of the demands kept hope alive </p><p>for another round of talks.  The CPN-UML staged a rally in </p><p>the capital on July 31 to pressure the GON and the Maoists </p><p>to continue dialogue.  The Rastriya Prajatantra Party (RPP) </p><p>also called on the Maoists to sit for another round. </p><p>MAOISTS FORMING TIES IN INDIA </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>8.  According to press reports on July 25, the Government of </p><p>India voiced concern over the possibility that Maoists from </p><p>Nepal are forming ties with terrorist groups in India.  At a </p><p>meeting attended by senior police and civilian officials </p><p>from the Indian state of Bihar and the India-Nepal border </p><p>districts of Bara and Parsa, Indian officials reportedly </p><p>voiced concerns on alleged violence committed in India by </p><p>Maoists who are aligning themselves with India\'s militant </p><p>People\'s War Group (PWG) and Maoist Communist Center (MCC). </p><p>The governments of Nepal and India have agreed in the past </p><p>to share intelligence in order to combat terrorist </p><p>activities in both countries. </p><p> </p><p>RIM EXERTS RADICAL INFLUENCE FROM INDIA </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  On July 30 Mohan Bikram Singh, a former mentor to </p><p>Baburam Bhattarai and Pushpa Kamal Dahal (Prachanda), told a </p><p>local publication that the Maoists "no longer see any </p><p>purpose in continuing with dialogue."  Singh also claimed </p><p>that the Maoists are under intense pressure from Maoist </p><p>cadres and international allies to abandon dialogue and </p><p>return to violence.  At the forefront of those exerting </p><p>pressure is the Revolutionary Internationalist Movement </p><p>(RIM), which is known for encouraging revolution over </p><p>dialogue.  (Note:  RIM imposed pressure on the Shining Path, </p><p>the Maoist organization in Peru, to abandon dialogue and </p><p>return to war.  End note).  Senior Maoist leaders reportedly </p><p>attended a recent RIM conference in the Indian State of </p><p>Bihar (Ref D), where attendees praised the insurgency, </p><p>claiming "Nepal is advancing to new heights and transforming </p><p>the country into a bastion of world proletarian movement," </p><p>and adopted the slogans of "Hands Off Nepal" and "Look to </p><p>the Himalayas, a Better World in Birth."  RIM reportedly has </p><p>also aligned itself with the Maoists and the Maoist </p><p>Communist Center (MCC) of India. </p><p> </p><p>MAOISTS CLASH WITH SECURITY FORCES </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  On July 30 five unarmed Royal Nepal Army (RNA) </p><p>personnel in the eastern district of Sindhuli were attacked </p><p>by a large group of armed Maoists.  Responding security </p><p>forces found three alive and two who had been brutally </p><p>beaten and then shot to death.  The soldiers reportedly had </p><p>just returned from collecting their salaries, which the </p><p>insurgents appropriated.   The brutal murders were condemned </p><p>by the Defense Ministry in a press release issued on July </p><p>31.  On July 29 Maoists reportedly killed a head constable </p><p>of police in Kaski District by slashing his throat. </p><p> </p><p>11.  Security forces and Maoists clashed in the western </p><p>district of Surkhet on July 30.  According to security </p><p>forces, the insurgents opened fire and a clash ensued for </p><p>almost two hours.  No injuries were reported, but army </p><p>personnel recovered nine socket bombs, ammunition and rifles </p><p>left by the Maoists at the scene. </p><p> </p><p>DEUBA ACCUSES MAOISTS OF PREPARING FOR WAR </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>12.  Sher Bahadur Deuba, President of the Nepali Congress </p><p>(Democratic) and former Prime Minister, accused the Maoists </p><p>on July 25 of preparing for war.  According to press reports </p><p>Deuba said that the Maoists would "stage a drama of </p><p>dialogue" before waging war, and claimed that the insurgents </p><p>were actively recruiting cadres, extorting money and </p><p>importing ammunition from abroad.  (Note:  Deuba was Prime </p><p>Minister when the Maoists walked out of peace talks after </p><p>two rounds of dialogue in 2001 and subsequently launched </p><p>simultaneous attacks on a police post and army barracks, </p><p>killing fourteen soldiers and thirty-seven policemen. End </p><p>Note). </p><p> </p><p>13.  The local press quoted an unnamed senior Royal Nepal </p><p>Army (RNA) official on July 30 as saying that the Maoists </p><p>have amassed arms and ammunition in the eastern region of </p><p>the country as a possible prelude to war. </p><p> </p><p>MAOISTS WARN AGAINST WORKING WITH USG PROGRAMS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>14.  Maoists continue to increase anti-American rhetoric. </p><p>The insurgents have posted notices in the districts of </p><p>Nuwakot, Rasuwa, and Sindhupalchowk ordering residents not </p><p>to work with USG funded projects and warning of severe </p><p>punishment to anyone who defies the order.  The notice </p><p>claims "under the cover of Save the Children US, the U.S. </p><p>imperialists are conducting activities."  Maoists have </p><p>warned that if the notices are ignored, they would be </p><p>"compelled to take severe action." </p><p> </p><p>15.  The All Nepal National Independent Students\' Union- </p><p>Revolutionary (ANNISU-R), the Maoist affiliated student </p><p>organization, has reached a deal with the Private and </p><p>Boarding School Organization of Nepal (PABSON) to </p><p>discontinue employment of any foreign teachers, mostly </p><p>Indian nationals and Bhutanese refugees.  The militant </p><p>student organization has announced "severe action" against </p><p>any schools that fail to comply. </p><p> </p><p>MAOIST EXTORTION INTENSIFIES </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>16.  Maoists continue to intensify extortion demands.  In </p><p>the far-western district of Humla the insurgents reportedly </p><p>are targeting teachers and businessmen in the villages, and </p><p>looting food from the farmers.  Civilians who refuse to </p><p>donate allegedly have been abducted and beaten.  In Kailali </p><p>District a group of Maoists severely beat two civilians who </p><p>were unable to give them USD 700, an exorbitant amount in </p><p>that region. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>17.  The breakdown of the ceasefire has been avoided for </p><p>now, but the prospects for further peace talks remain </p><p>fragile.  Prachanda\'s statement, though agreeing to another </p><p>round of talks, is ominously critical of the dialogue so </p><p>far, labeling the peace process as a "joke and a situation </p><p>of confusion."  The Maoist negotiating team reportedly is </p><p>still in India, so it is unclear when a third round will </p><p>occur.  Virtually no one to who we talk expresses any </p><p>confidence that a return to warfare can be avoided in the </p><p>longer term without concerted foreign pressure.  End </p><p>Comment. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
