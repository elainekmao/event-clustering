<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ABU DHABI 000784 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARP, NEA/PPD, NEA/RA, INR </p><p>SECDEF FOR OASD/PA </p><p>USCINCCENT FOR POLAD </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH; PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: OIIP, KMDR, TC </p><p>SUBJECT:  MEDIA REACTION:  IRAQ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  SUMMARY:  UAE MEDIA EXTENSIVELY COVERED INTERNATIONAL </p><p>PROTESTS AND REACTION AGAINST A MILITARY STRIKE IN IRAQ.  LOCAL </p><p>AND REGIONAL MEDIA CRITICIZED WHAT THEY CALLED A WEAK ARAB STANCE </p><p>TOWARDS THE CURRENT CRISIS.  "AL ITTIHAD" CRITICIZES U.S. PLANS </p><p>TO CONTROL THE MIDDLE EAST, NOTING THIS IS NOT JUSTIFIED BY </p><p>INTERNATIONAL LAW.  SIMILARLY, AN "AL BAYAN" EDITORIAL ARGUES THE </p><p>INCREASING INTERNATIONAL OPPOSITION TO A U.S.-LED ATTACK ON IRAQ </p><p>INDICATES A REJECTION OF U.S. EFFORTS TO DOMINATE THE REGIONAL </p><p>AND CONTINUE ITS VIOLATION OF INTERNATIONAL LAW.  "AL KHALEEJ" </p><p>ARGUES THAT U.S. ISOLATION IS INCREASING DAILY AND PROVES THAT </p><p>THE WORLD WILL NOT BE A HOSTAGE TO THE CURRENT PLANS OF THE U.S. </p><p>ADMINISTRATION.  ANOTHER "AL ITTIHAD" EDITORIAL ARGUES THAT THE </p><p>ARABS MUST SEIZE THIS OPPORTUNITY AND JOIN THE ORGANIZED </p><p>INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS TO FIND A PEACEFUL SOLUTION TO THE CRISIS </p><p>DRING THE UPCOMING REGIONAL SUMMIT.  FINALLY, A SEPARATE "AL </p><p>KHALEEJ" EDITORIAL URGES ARABS TO SAY "NO TO WAR." END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  CRITICIZING U.S. PLANS FOR THE MIDDLE EAST, ABU DHABI-BASED </p><p>SEMI-GOVERNMENT "AL ITTIHAD" EDITORIALIZED ON 2/10: </p><p> </p><p>"... THE AMERICAN GOALS EXCEED IRAQ.  THE U.S. PLAYS A ROLE WHICH </p><p>CONFLICTS WITH THE INTERESTS OF THE PEOPLE IN THE REGION.  WHO </p><p>GIVES THE U.S. THE RIGHT TO CONTROL COUNTRIES IN THE MIDDLE EAST </p><p>AND RE-ARRANGE THEM?  WE FIRMLY SAY THAT THERE IS NO LAW THAT </p><p>JUSTIFIES WHAT IS HAPPENING.   IT IS FAIR TO ASK WHERE IS YOUR </p><p>CLAIMED FOR DEMOCRACY WHEN YOU ARE PLANNING TO REARRANGE THE </p><p>MIDDLE EAST WITHOUT PAYING ATTENTION TO THE INTERESTS OF ITS </p><p>PEOPLE AND WHEN YOU DECLARE THAT THE TARGET OF THE REARRANGEMENT </p><p>IS TO STRENGTHEN YOUR OWN INTERESTS.  AMID THE NOISE AND DRUMS OF </p><p>WAR, WE HEAR ABOUT THE INTENTION TO OCCUPY IRAQ AND STAY FOR A </p><p>LONG TIME AFTER TURNING IT INTO AN AMERICAN AND BRITISH COLONY. </p><p>THIS IS NOT ACCEPTED BY ANY ARAB OR MUSLIM.  IRAQ IS NOT </p><p>AFGHANISTAN, AND IF THERE IS OCCUPATION, ARABS AND MUSLIMS WILL </p><p>HAVE ONE STANCE AND SAY ONE WORD ... WE STRESS THAT THERE IS </p><p>STILL A CHANCE FOR PEACE AND THE CRISIS COULD BE SOLVED </p><p>PEACEFULLY.  WE MUST HEAR THE VOICE OF WISE PEOPLE IN FRANCE, </p><p>GERMANY, AND EUROPE CALLING FOR PEACE AND MORE PATIENCE BECAUSE </p><p>THE MISSION OF THE WMD INSPECTORS HAS NOT FAILED YET, AND IRAQ IS </p><p>COOPERATING WITH THEM ..." </p><p> </p><p>3.  ASSUMING THAT THE U.S. LACKS INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT FOR ITS </p><p>WAR ON IRAQ, DUBAI-BASED BUSINESS-ORIENTED "AL BAYAN" </p><p>EDITORIALIZED ON 2/10: </p><p> </p><p>"... ONCE AGAIN THE U.S. DOES NOT HAVE INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT FOR </p><p>ITS PLANS IN IRAQ.  IT WILL BE A DISASTER IF THE U.S. GOES TO WAR </p><p>ALONE, IGNORING THE U.N.  THIS HAS ONE EXPLANATION ONLY, I.E., </p><p>THAT THE U.S. IS PLAYING THE ROLE OF A NEW IMPERIAL POWER TRYING </p><p>TO DOMINATE OTHERS, AND CONSEQUENTLY VIOLATING INTERNATIONAL </p><p>LAWS." </p><p> </p><p>4.  PRAISING THE FRENCH-RUSSIAN-GERMAN INITIATIVE, "AL ITTIHAD" </p><p>EDITORIALIZED ON 2/12: </p><p> </p><p>"... EFFORTS EXERTED BY FRANCE, RUSSIA, GERMANY, AND OTHER </p><p>EUROPEAN COUNTRIES MUST BE TREATED WELL AS THEY MAY LEAD TO GOOD </p><p>RESULTS.  THEY ALSO MUST BE TREATED CAREFULLY AS SOME MAY </p><p>CONSIDER THEM AS A SHIELD TO PROTECT THE WRONG PEOPLE.  HOWEVER, </p><p>THEY ARE A NEW CHANCE TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY EVEN IF THE THERE IS </p><p>LITTLE HOPE." </p><p> </p><p>5.  DESCRIBING THE CONFLICT INSIDE NATO AS A REAL CRISIS BETWEEN </p><p>WASHINGTON AND ITS ALLIES, SHARJAH-BASED PAN-ARAB "AL KHALEEJ" </p><p>EDITORIALIZED ON 2/13: </p><p> </p><p>"... ARAB COUNTRIES MUST, IN THESE CRITICAL MOMENTS, TAKE THE </p><p>OPPORTUNITY TO SUPPORT THE FRENCH-GERMAN EFFORTS (FOR A PEACEFUL </p><p>RESOLUTION) AND BECOME A PRESSING FORCE TO STOP THE AMERICAN </p><p>DRIVE TOWARDS AN AGGRESSION BRINGING DISASTERS FOR ARABS IF IT </p><p>HAPPENS." </p><p> </p><p>6.  COMMENTING ON THE DISCUSSION INSIDE THE UNSC AND THE </p><p>WORLDWIDE DEMONSTRATIONS AGAINST A U.S.-LED WAR ON IRAQ, "AL </p><p>KHALEEJ" EDITORIALIZED ON 2/16: </p><p> </p><p>"... THE U.S. ISOLATION INCREASED DURING THE LAST TWO DAYS.  THE </p><p>WORLD PROVES THAT IT IS NOT A HOSTAGE TO THE AMERICAN </p><p>ADMINISTRATION AND ITS PLANS.  IT ALSO PROVES THAT IT IS READY TO </p><p>RESIST THOSE PLANS.  THE ARABS MUST JOIN THIS PARADE IN THEIR </p><p>NEXT SUMMIT." </p><p> </p><p>7.  IN ANOTHER EDITORIAL, "AL KHALEEJ" SAID ON 2/15: </p><p> </p><p>"... THE U.S.-BRITISH-ISRAELI WAR AGAINST IRAQ WILL AFFECT ALL </p><p>ARABS.  THUS, THE TITLE OF THE AWAITED REGIONAL SUMMIT MUST BE </p><p>\'NO TO WAR\' IN THE REGION." </p><p> </p><p>8.  ARGUING THAT THERE IS A FISSURE IN THE ALLIANCE OF WAR </p><p>SUPPORTERS, "AL ITTIHAD" EDITORIALIZED ON 2/16: </p><p> </p><p>"... THE ARABS - WHO ARE EXPECTED TO HOLD THEIR SUMMIT NEXT WEEK </p><p>- MUST TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY AND JOIN THE ORGANIZED INTERNATIONAL </p><p>EFFORTS HOPING TO FIND A PEACEFUL SOLUTION FOR THE CRISIS, </p><p>PUTTING PRESSURE ON THE IRAQI REGIME TO COMPLY WITH THE U.N. </p><p>RESOLUTIONS, AND PLACING THE INTEREST OF THE IRAQI PEOPLE OVER </p><p>ANY PERSONAL INTERESTS." </p><p> </p><p>9.  CRITICIZING THE SILENCE OF ARABS, ABU DHABI-BASED PAN-ARAB </p><p>"AKHBAR AL ARAB" EDITORIALIZED ON 2/14: </p><p> </p><p>"... UNDOUBTEDLY, THE ARABS WILL BE THE NEXT TARGET OF AN ATTACK </p><p>FOLLOWING THE OCCUPATION AND DESTRUCTION OF IRAQ.  WASHINGTON IS </p><p>NOT KEEPING THIS A SECRET ANYMORE.  IT TALKS IN PUBLIC ABOUT </p><p>REDRAWING THE MIDDLE EAST MAP IN A WAY TO SERVE AMERICAN AND THEN </p><p>ISRAELI INTERESTS." </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
