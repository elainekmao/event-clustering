(U) REF A TURKISH PRESS SUMMARY (BEIN6 REPEATED TO </p><p>MOSCOW) NOTED TURKISH PRESS REPORTS THAT ON OCTOBER 29 </p><p>-KURDISH SEPARATISTS FROM TURKEY STARTED A THREE-DAY </p><p>MEETING IN MOSCOW AIMED AT UNITING AND STRENGTHENING THE </p><p>KURDISH MOVEMENT WITHIN THE COMMONWEALTH OF INDEPENDENT </p><p>STATES. THE MEETING, SPONSORED BY THE PKK (KURDISTAN </p><p>WORKERS\' PARTY), IS PART OF A CAMPAIGN IN THE FORMER </p><p>EAST BLOC. THE CONFERENCE WAS CLOSED TO TURKISH </p><p>JOURNALISTS.- REF B PRESS SUMMARY QUOTED TURKISH PRESS </p><p>REPORTS THAT THE CONFERENCE ENDED OCTOBER 31 HAVING </p><p>ELECTED ONE YURI NEBIEV LEADER OF A -KURDISH UNION." </p><p>TURKEY REPORTEDLY PROTESTED THE CONFERENCE VIA </p><p>DIPLOMATIC CHANNELS. (NB: TURKEY HAS NOT ASKED THE USG </p><p>FOR SUPPORT ON THIS ISSUE.) </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>THE THREAT </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) DEPARTMENT UNDERSTANDS THAT PRO-PKK CONFERENCES </p><p>OF THIS NATURE HAVE BEEN HELD PREVIOUSLY, AND THAT THE </p><p>RUSSIANS HAVE IN THE PAST ASSURED TURKEY THAT MOSCOW HAS </p><p>NO INTENTION OF ESTABLISHING TIES WITH THE PKK (REF C). </p><p>EXPERIENCE WITH THE PKK AND ITS FRONTS IN WESTERN EUROPE </p><p>HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT THE ORGANIZATION CAN POSE A DANGER </p><p>EVEN WITHOUT THE FORMAL SUPPORT OF THE HOST GOVERNMENT. </p><p>DEPARTMENT WOULD BE CONCERNED WERE MOSCOW TO BECOME A </p><p>CENTER OF OPERATIONAL SUPPORT ACTIVITY FOR PKK TERRORISM </p><p>(E.G., WEAPONS PROCUREMENT, TRAINING) -- REPORTS OF SUCH </p><p>ACTIVITY HAVE SURFACED IN THE PAST (E.G.

(C) THE USG CONSIDERS THE PKK TO BE A TERRORIST </p><p>ORGANIZATION, NOT/NOT A LEGITIMATE POLITICAL MOVEMENT. </p><p>OUR SUPPORT FOR TURKISH EFFORTS TO COMBAT THE PKK IS </p><p>BASED NOT ONLY ON THE THREAT IT POSES TO TURKEY, BUT IN </p><p>PART ON THE GROUP\'S PAST AND PRESENT ACTIONS THREATENING </p><p>AMERICAN LIVES AND INTERESTS. SINCE THE 1984 START OF </p><p>ITS CAMPAIGN TO CARVE A KURDISH STATE OUT OF THE TURKISH </p><p>SOUTHEAST, THE PKK HAS REPEATEDLY TAKEN AMERICANS </p><p>HOSTAGE AND ATTACKED US ECONOMIC TAR6ETS. THE PKK\'S </p><p>ONGOING BOMBING CAMPAIGN AIMED AT TOURIST SITES IN </p><p>TURKEY ENDANGERS AMERICAN AS WELL AS TURKISH AND </p><p>PORT FORTHE PKK WAS FREQUENTLY ALLEGED. </p><p> </p><p>5. (S) THE PKK\'S POLITICAL WING, ERNK, MAINTAINS A </p><p>PRESENCE IN A NUMBER OF EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, INCLUDING </p><p>SOME WHICH BAN THE PKK. AFTER THE PKK ENGAGED IN </p><p>TERRORISM IN WESTERN EUROPE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 1993, </p><p>FRANCE AND GERMANY BANNED THE GROUP AND DOZENS OF ITS </p><p>FRONTS. ERNK CLAIMS ITS INTERNATIONAL OFFICES ENGAGE </p><p>ONLY IN ORGANIZATIONAL AND INFORMATION ACTIVITY. </p><p>HOWEVER, THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT IN SOME COUNTRIES ERNK </p><p>OFFICIALS HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN OPERATIONAL TERRORIST </p><p>SUPPORT ACTIVITY. DEPARTMENT SEEKS TO DISCOURAGE </p><p>GOVERNMENTS FROM DRAWING A FACILE DISTINCTION BETWEEN </p><p>"TERRORIST- PKK AND "POLITICAL" ERNK. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>ACTION REQUESTED </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) AT THIS STAGE, THE DEPARTMENT WOULD LIKE TO </p><p>REVIEW THE LATEST READILY-AVAILABLE INFORMATION ON </p><p>PKK-RELATED ACTIVITY IN RUSSIA, WITH AN EYE TOWARD A </p><p>POSSIBLE DEMARCHE TO MOSCOW DETAILING OUR CONCERNS ABOUT </p><p>THE PKK AND ITS FRONTS. PLEASE REPORT ON THE NATURE, </p><p>SCOPE, AND PARTICIPANTS OF THE CONFERENCE CITED IN REFS </p><p>A AND B, WITH PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO ANY RUSSIAN </p><p>GOVERNMENTAL INVOLVEMENT OR FACILITATION.

MORE BROADLY, DEPARTMENT WOULD BE INTERESTED IN </p><p>ANY INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO EMBASSY ON ACTIVITIES AND </p><p>INFRASTRUCTURE OF THE PKK, ERNK, OR OTHER PRO-PKK </p><p>SUPPORT OR FRONT ORGANIZATIONS IN RUSSIA. </p><p> </p><p>7.
