<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 002661 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EB/ESC, EUR/SE, NEA/RA, AND TREASURY </p><p>(BFOX/JZARATE/WMURDEN) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 4/24/2006 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, ETTC, EFIN, TU, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: FREEZING IRAQI ASSETS: INITIAL TURKISH RESPONSE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 101736 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. SUMMARY: (C) On April 24, we delivered reftel demarche to </p><p>Central Bank Governor Sureyya Serdengecti and Banking </p><p>Regulation and Supervision Agency (BRSA) Acting Chairman </p><p>Ibrahim Canakci.  Both officials said they would make this a </p><p>top priority and welcomed any information or assistance. </p><p>Serdengecti welcomed the USG delegation of experts as well. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Serdengecti told us he would make investigation of </p><p>Iraqi assets a top priority.  The Central Bank monitors </p><p>electronic bank transfers and gets other information on bank </p><p>transfers.  He also welcomed a U.S. delegation visit. </p><p>"Exchanging information is always beneficial.  We learn from </p><p>them, they learn from us.  It\'s a great idea," Serdengecti </p><p>said.  Serdengecti explained that, while the Central Bank can </p><p>search for records of Iraqi assets, freezing those assets in </p><p>Turkey would be the responsibility of the Ministry of Finance </p><p>(visit is planned for April 25 - septel). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Serdengecti said he suspected there were still </p><p>existing Turkish-Iraqi private sector links, recalling </p><p>requests by Turks to exchange huge amounts of Kuwaiti dinars </p><p>after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990.  But Serdengecti </p><p>also noted the Saddam regime may have been reluctant to </p><p>deposit money in Turkey, given the claims of Turkish </p><p>exporters to Iraq, which date back to before the first Gulf </p><p>War.  They amount to $1.2 billion in non-payments, beginning </p><p>during the 1980\'s, when GOI and Iraqi businesses did not pay </p><p>Turkish exporters during the Iran-Iraq War.  Under an </p><p>agreement between the GOT and the Saddam Hussein regime, the </p><p>GOI was supposed to reimburse the Treasury, which in turn was </p><p>reimbursing the exporters.  Serdengecti said that all </p><p>payments from the GOI ended just prior to the first Gulf War </p><p>(Treasury was the loser, as it reimbursed exporters the full </p><p>amount.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Earlier April 24, BRSA Acting Chairman Ibrahim </p><p>Canakci told us the BRSA\'s sworn bank auditors would be </p><p>alerted to this request.  He also welcomed any information or </p><p>assistance the U.S. could offer. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
