ROME 443 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: POLITICAL MINISTER-COUNSELOR THOMAS COUNTRYMAN </p><p>FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: PM BERLUSCONI WILL NOT/NOT MEET TAREQ AZIZ </p><p>DURING HIS TRIP TO ROME.  WHILE NOT CONFIRMED YET, IT IS </p><p>LIKELY FM FRATTINI WILL MEET AZIZ IN ROME FEB. 14.  GOI </p><p>OFFICIALS CONFIRMED THAT THEY WILL GIVE AZIZ A STRONG MESSAGE </p><p>IN PRIVATE AND WILL REITERATE THE SAME MESSAGE PUBLICLY: THE </p><p>GAME IS OVER; SADDAM MUST COOPERATE IMMEDIATELY, ACTIVELY AND </p><p>FULLY IN IRAQ\'S DISARMAMENT AND GO INTO EXILE, OR ELSE FACE </p><p>VERY SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.

BERLUSCONI HAD </p><p>ALREADY DECIDED HE WAS NOT GOING TO MEET WITH TAREQ AZIZ, </p><p>DIONISI TOLD US FEB. 11, AND OUR POINTS CONFIRMED HIS </p><p>POSITION.  THE PM HAS NOT DECIDED YET WHO FROM THE GOI WOULD </p><p>MEET AZIZ, STRESSED DIONISI, BUT IT WAS LIKELY TO BE FM </p><p>FRATTINI, ON FEB. 14 AFTER AZIZ\'S AUDIENCE WITH THE POPE (REF </p><p>E.) </p><p> </p><p>3.

IF AZIZ WERE TO MEET ONLY WITH THE POPE AND </p><p>OPPOSITION MEMBERS WHO ARE AGAINST THE WAR, ITALIAN AND </p><p>INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC OPINION WOULD PERCEIVE HIM AS A "SAINT" </p><p>AND THOSE WHO REFUSED TO MEET HIM, THE GOI IN THIS CASE, AS </p><p>"EVIL," SAID DIONISI.  IT WOULD BE MORE USEFUL TO MEET WITH </p><p>AZIZ, GIVE HIM IN PRIVATE AND THEN REITERATE IN PUBLIC THE </p><p>MESSAGE THAT SADDAM MUST COOPERATE IMMEDIATELY, ACTIVELY, AND </p><p>VOLUNTARILY IN IRAQ\'S DISARMAMENT, GO PEACEFULLY INTO EXILE, </p><p>OR BE DISARMED AND REMOVED FROM POWER BY FORCE. </p><p> </p><p>4.

(NOTE: ANNAN </p><p>WILL HAVE A WORKING LUNCH WITH BERLUSCONI IN ROME FEB. 18, TO </p><p>WHICH AZIZ WILL NOT/NOT BE INVITED EVEN IF HE IS STILL IN </p><p>ROME, ASSURED DIONISI.  END NOTE.)
