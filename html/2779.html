(SBU) SUMMARY: AN EASTER SUNRISE SERVICE PACKED THE </p><p>COMPOUND OF A 90-YEAR-OLD WOODEN CHURCH WITH THOUSANDS </p><p>OF ETHNIC MINORITY CATHOLIC WORSHIPPERS FROM VILLAGES </p><p>IN KON TUM PROVINCE IN VIETNAM\'S CENTRAL HIGHLANDS. </p><p>THE TWO-HOUR SERVICE, CONDUCTED ENTIRELY IN ETHNIC </p><p>LANGUAGES, INCORPORATED TRIBAL MUSIC AND DANCE. </p><p>AFTERWARDS, DURING A CONVERSATION WITH THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>IN THE PRESENCE OF WHAT APPEARED TO BE PLAINCLOTHES </p><p>SECURITY OFFICERS, THE CHURCH\'S PRIEST WAS RELUCTANT TO </p><p>ESTIMATE THE NUMBER OF WORSHIPPERS IN ATTENDANCE.  POST </p><p>ESTIMATES THAT UPWARDS OF 10,000 PERSONS WERE PRESENT </p><p>TO FREELY EXERCISE THEIR FAITH.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) AMBASSADOR, CG, CONOFF, FSN POL/ECON ASSISTANT </p><p>AND THE AMBASSADOR\'S INTERPRETER ATTENDED THE EASTER </p><p>SUNRISE SERVICE AT KON TUM\'S "NHA THO GO" OR "WOODEN </p><p>CHURCH".  CONGEN HAD BEEN INFORMED THAT THE SERVICE </p><p>WOULD LIKELY BE WELL-ATTENDED.  SHOULD THE NUMBER OF </p><p>WORSHIPPERS OVERFLOW THE SANCTUARY, PEOPLE WOULD BE </p><p>ACCOMMODATED IN AREAS IMMEDIATELY OUTSIDE THE CHURCH </p><p>BUILDING.  ARRIVING AT THE CHURCH, CONGENOFFS </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HO CHI  00394  01 OF 02  171252Z </p><p>DISCOVERED THAT THE "OVERFLOW" AMOUNTED TO MORE THAN </p><p>10,000 WORSHIPPERS.  THE CHURCH COMPOUND WAS NOT </p><p>CAPABLE OF HOLDING ALL ATTENDEES AND THE SPILLOVER </p><p>CROWD BLOCKED THE ROAD IN FRONT OF THE CHURCH, CAUSING </p><p>DIFFICULTY FOR PASSING VEHICLES. (COMMENT: POST\'S </p><p>ESTIMATE OF 10,000-PLUS PEOPLE IN THE CHURCH COMPOUND </p><p>IS BASED ON THE NUMBER OF ROWS IN A SECTION MULTIPLIED </p><p>BY THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN EACH ROW.) </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) FATHER LIEN THANH NGUYEN, AN ETHNIC VIETNAMESE </p><p>KINH ORIGINALLY FROM NORTHERN VIETNAM, LED THE WORSHIP </p><p>PRIMARILY IN THE BA NA LANGUAGE, WITH PORTIONS IN THE </p><p>SEDANG LANGUAGE.  FOLLOWING THE ORDER OF SERVICE, </p><p>WORSHIPPERS DECKED IN TRADITIONAL, COLORFUL DRESS </p><p>ALTERNATED STANDING AND SITTING ON THE GROUND OR ON </p><p>STRAW MATS.  THE MUSICAL INTERLUDES WERE PROVIDED BY </p><p>ETHNIC MINORITY MUSICIANS USING TRADITIONAL INSTRUMENTS </p><p>(WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE ORGAN).  GIRLS IN BRIGHTLY- </p><p>WOVEN NATIVE DRESS PERFORMED DANCES, ACCOMPANIED BY </p><p>HIGHLAND GONGS.  MIDWAY THROUGH THE SERVICE, THE BISHOP </p><p>OF KON TUM ARRIVED TO CELEBRATE THE EUCHARIST. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) COMMUNION WAS SERVED TO THE ENTIRE CROWD BY AN </p><p>ESTIMATED 30 WHITE-ROBED PRIESTS FROM LOCAL CHURCHES. </p><p>THROUGHOUT THE CROWD, ORDERLY LINES CIRCLED AROUND </p><p>THOSE SERVING THE COMMUNION WAFER.  COMMUNION ITSELF </p><p>LASTED 25 MINUTES. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) SOME ATTENDEES CARRIED SMALL BOOKS IN THEIR </p><p>ETHNIC LANGUAGE, APPARENTLY EITHER PRAYER OR SONG </p><p>BOOKS.  FEW CELEBRANTS SPOKE VIETNAMESE.  WORSHIPPERS </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HO CHI  00394  01 OF 02  171252Z </p><p>SMILED AND WERE SHYLY CURIOUS ABOUT THE PRESENCE OF </p><p>FOREIGNERS/AMERICANS AT THE SERVICE.  LOCAL VIETNAMESE </p><p>MEDIA CARRYING STILL AND VIDEO CAMERAS DOCUMENTED THE </p><p>SERVICE.  PLAINCLOTHES POLICE WERE ALSO IN ATTENDANCE </p><p>AND MONITORED THE CROWD FROM THE BACK, BUT AT NO TIME </p><p>INTERFERED WITH THE SERVICE.  (NOTE: POST BELIEVES SOME </p><p>OF THE LOCAL MEDIA REPRESENTATIVES WERE ACTUALLY </p><p>SECURITY AGENTS AS WELL.  WHEN CONOFF TRIED TO TAKE </p><p>PHOTOS TO DOCUMENT THE "MEDIA\'S" PRESENCE, THEY AVERTED </p><p>THEIR FACES.) </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) COMMENT:  AFTER THE SERVICE, FATHER LIEN </p><p>INDICATED THAT CROWDS OF THIS SIZE - OR LARGER - ARE </p><p>ROUTINE ON IMPORTANT DAYS IN THE CATHOLIC CALENDAR. </p><p>ONE OF THE PLAINCLOTHES SECURITY AGENTS FOLLOWED THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR AND CONGENOFFS INTO THE RECTORY, STAYED A </p><p>DISCREET DISTANCE AWAY, AND DID NOT OVERTLY INTERFERE </p><p>WITH CONVERSATION.  FATHER LIEN, HOWEVER, SEEMED TO </p><p>DOWNPLAY THE NUMBERS SEEN THAT EASTER SUNDAY.  STILL, </p><p>CONGENOFFS WERE IMPRESSED BY THE NATURALNESS OF BOTH </p><p>THE SETTING AND THE CONGREGATION DURING THE SUNRISE </p><p>SERVICE.  NOBODY LOOKED FEARFUL OR FURTIVE.  IT WAS A </p><p>STRIKING EXAMPLE OF HOW "FREE" RELIGION CAN BE IN </p><p>VIETNAM - AS LONG AS IT IS A LEGALLY RECOGNIZED </p><p>RELIGION.  THE LARGE, PEACEFUL CROWD - WHILE MONITORED </p><p>BY PLAINCLOTHES POLICE - WAS LEFT TO PRACTICE THEIR </p><p>FAITH OPENLY.  THE SHEER NUMBERS, THE RESPECT FOR </p><p>ETHNIC MINORITY CULTURE, AND THE QUIET INTENT OF EACH </p><p>BELIEVER AS HE/SHE LISTENED TO A MASS CELEBRATED IN TWO </p><p>ETHNIC LANGUAGES WAS MOVING.
