<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 002504 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/18/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, TU, IS </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKS AND ISRAELIS SAY THEY ARE PLEASED WITH </p><p>FOREIGN  MINISTER SHALOM\'S VISIT TO TURKEY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: TEL AVIV 1959 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by DCM Robert Deutsch for reasons </p><p>1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary: The Israeli Embassy used terms </p><p>like "positive, excellent," and Turkish MFA "successful" </p><p>to describe Israeli Foreign Minister Shalom\'s first </p><p>official visit to Turkey April 13-14.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Israeli DCM Nahshon told us April 15 plans for </p><p>FonMin Shalom\'s April 13-14 visit had been in suspense </p><p>a "long time" -- the last time an Israeli FonMin </p><p>visited Turkey was during Turkish FonMin Cem\'s tenure, </p><p>more than a year ago.  Nahshon averred that the two </p><p>countries share interests in many fields.  He noted </p><p>Israel accepted "with gratitude" Turkey\'s offer to </p><p>play "any role" it could in the Middle East Peace </p><p>Negotiations, although nothing formal is envisioned </p><p>currently.  Turkish MFA Levant desk officer Demirok </p><p>told us Shalom began his travel with a private visit </p><p>with the Jewish community in Istanbul prior to his </p><p>official meetings with President Sezer P.M. Erdogan </p><p>and FonMin Gul. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Nahshon and Demirok noted discussions also </p><p>focused on working together on water projects in </p><p>Turkey\'s GAP region.  The two counties expect to </p><p>sign a bilateral agreement in May to transport 50 </p><p>million cubic meters of water/year for 20 years from </p><p>Manavgat, Turkey, to an Israeli port, most likely Haifa. </p><p>Israel plans to offer the water shipping contract for </p><p>public tender. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Nahshon said Israel and Turkey have different </p><p>perspectives, but not necessarily different opinions, </p><p>regarding terrorism emanating from Syria and Lebanon. </p><p>Assuring us Turkey is justified in embarking on new </p><p>dialogue with Syria, he said that as a result of </p><p>Shalom\'s visit Israel understood the Turks would </p><p>visit Syria to "understand the Syrian mind and to </p><p>tell them they are making a mistake in their current </p><p>policy." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  Comment: Prevailing wisdom in Ankara is that, </p><p>while the AK government does not want to be seen by </p><p>its conservative grass roots to be embracing Israel, </p><p>Erdogan and Gul now recognize relations with Israel </p><p>are an untouchable equity of the Turkish military. </p><p>End comment. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
