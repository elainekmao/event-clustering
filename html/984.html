<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 HAVANA 000075 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ROME ALSO FOR EMBASSY VATICAN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 1-6-09 </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, PGOV, PINR, CU </p><p>SUBJECT:  CASTRO SPEAKS ON REVOLUTION\'S 40TH BIRTHDAY </p><p> </p><p>REF:  FBIS 301938Z DEC 98 </p><p> </p><p>(U)  CLASSIFIED BY MICHAEL G. KOZAK, PRINCIPAL </p><p>OFFICER, FOR REASON 1.5 (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  SUMMARY:  IN A RELATIVELY SHORT JANUARY 1 </p><p>SPEECH, FIDEL CASTRO RECALLED THE HEROIC MOMENTS OF </p><p>HIS REVOLUTIONS TRIUMPH 40 YEARS AGO AND WARNED OF </p><p>THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC CRISIS HE SAID WAS INEVITABLE. </p><p>ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS, CASTRO SPOKE TO CUBAS YOUTH, </p><p>TELLING THEM THAT CUBAS REVOLUTION "HAS JUST BEGUN", </p><p>AND REMINDING THEM THAT "GLORIOUS ACCOMPLISHMENTS" </p><p>AWAIT THEM, TOO.  CASTROS CHICKEN LITTLE SCENARIO </p><p>FOR WORLD FINANCES AND HIS TOTAL AVOIDANCE OF THE </p><p>CUBAN PEOPLES REAL PERSONAL CRISES GIVE NO EVIDENCE </p><p>OF A PLAN FOR RESCUING CUBA FROM THE ECONOMIC AND </p><p>OTHER CRISES IT FINDS ITSELF IN.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  CASTROS SPEECH, PRINTED IN ITS ENTIRETY IN </p><p>THE JANUARY 4 EDITION OF THE WEEKLY "TRABAJADORES", </p><p>TOOK PLACE IN SANTIAGO DE CUBAS CESPEDES PARK. </p><p>CASTRO SPENT THE FIRST THIRD OF HIS SPEECH RECALLING </p><p>THE SACRIFICES AND HEROISM OF THE GUERRILLAS WHO </p><p>HELPED WIN THE FIRST BATTLES OF THE REVOLUTION IN </p><p>SEVERAL EASTERN CUBA TOWNS.  FIDEL CALLED CAMILO </p><p>CIENFUEGOS AND CHE GUEVARA "MEN OF IRON", AND </p><p>ENCOURAGED CUBAN YOUTH TO READ CHES WAR NARRATIVE </p><p>"PASAJES DE LA GUERRA REVOLUCIONARIA."  CASTRO NOTED </p><p>THAT THE ONLY OUTSIDE ASSISTANCE THE REVOLUTION </p><p>RECEIVED WERE 150 SEMI-AUTOMATIC RIFLES SENT BY THE </p><p>VENEZUELAN ADMIRAL LARRAZABAL.  OTHERWISE, SAID </p><p>FIDEL, "MORE THAN NINETY PERCENT OF THE ARMS AND </p><p>MUNITIONS WITH WHICH WE MADE AND WON THE WAR WERE </p><p>TAKEN FROM THE ENEMY IN COMBAT." </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  TRANSITIONING FROM THE BATTLEFIELD TO </p><p>PRESENT-DAY CUBA, CASTRO SAID "FOR THE NEWER </p><p>GENERATIONS, THE REVOLUTION HAS JUST BEGUN."  CASTRO </p><p>NOTED THAT THOSE PRESENT WERE NOT THE SAME AS THOSE </p><p>CUBANS PRESENT AT THE TIME OF THE REVOLUTIONS </p><p>TRIUMPH.  CASTRO ADDED THAT HE HIMSELF WAS "NOT </p><p>EXACTLY THE SAME MAN" THAT HE WAS FORTY YEARS AGO. </p><p>"HE IS ONLY SOMEONE MUCH YOUNGER, WHO HAS THE SAME </p><p>NAME, WHO DRESSES THE SAME, WHO THINKS THE SAME, WHO </p><p>DREAMS THE SAME." </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  COMPARING DEMOGRAPHICS OF 1959 CUBA TO 1999 </p><p>CUBA, CASTRO SAID OF THE ROUGHLY 11 MILLION CUBANS IN </p><p>CUBA TODAY, 7.2 MILLION WERE BORN AFTER THE TRIUMPH </p><p>OF THE REVOLUTION, AND ANOTHER 1.35 MILLION WERE LESS </p><p>THAN TEN YEARS OLD.  HE CLAIMED THAT "THIRTY PERCENT" </p><p>OF CUBANS IN 1959 COULD NOT READ, AND "SIXTY PERCENT" </p><p>HAD NOT COMPLETED SIXTH GRADE.  NOW, SAID CASTRO, </p><p>TEACHERS AND PROFESSORS IN CUBA NUMBER 250,000; </p><p>THERE ARE 64,000 DOCTORS, AND 600,000 UNIVERSITY </p><p>GRADUATES.  "AN ILLITERATE PERSON DOES NOT EXIST, AND </p><p>IT IS EXTREMELY RARE THAT SOMEONE NOT HAVE A SIXTH </p><p>GRADE EDUCATION."  IN SUM, CASTRO SAID THE "HEROIC" </p><p>CUBAN PEOPLES MOST GLORIOUS AND REVOLUTIONARY EPOCH </p><p>HAS BEEN THE STILL-ONGOING "SPECIAL PERIOD", "AS WE </p><p>REMAIN ABSOLUTELY ALONE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WEST, 90 </p><p>MILES AWAY FROM THE UNITED STATES, AND WE HAVE </p><p>DECIDED TO KEEP GOING FORWARD." </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  CASTRO DEVOTED ALMOST THE ENTIRE REMAINDER </p><p>OF HIS SPEECH, ROUGHLY SIXTY PERCENT, WARNING </p><p>LISTENERS THAT THE CURRENT ECON0MIC SYSTEM IS </p><p>"UNSUSTAINABLE", THAT "THE ECON0MIC ORDER THAT </p><p>PREVAILS TODAY ON THE PLANET WILL INEVITABLY FALL", </p><p>AND THAT "MARKET THEOLOGY IS SECTARIAN, </p><p>FUNDAMENTALIST, AND ANTIECUMENICAL." </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  USING INFLAMMATORY RHETORIC, CASTRO </p><p>DISCUSSED THE "WOLVES" WHO SPECULATE IN FOREIGN </p><p>CURRENCIES, CREDITING GEORGE SOROS WITH "BRINGING </p><p>GREAT BRITAIN TO ITS KNEES" THROUGH SPECULATION IN </p><p>THE BRITISH POUND.  THE CUBAN LEADER ALSO SAID "THE </p><p>WHOLE WORLD IS TALKING ABOUT AN INTERNATIONAL </p><p>FINANCIAL CRISIS, THE ONLY ONES WHO HAVENT FOUND OUT </p><p>ABOUT IT ARE THE AMERICANS:  THEY HAVE SPENT MORE </p><p>THAN EVER, AND THEIR SAVINGS ARE LESS THAN ZERO." </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  CASTRO DESCRIBED TO THE SANTIAGO CROWD A </p><p>WORLD IN WHICH COMPLEX FINANCIAL STRUCTURES HAD </p><p>GOTTEN OUT OF CONTROL, COMPARING THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL </p><p>SYSTEM TO A HUMAN BODY INFECTED WITH AIDS.  FIDEL </p><p>SAID THE WORLD HAD TURNED INTO "ONE BIG CASINO" WHERE </p><p>"CURRENCY SPECULATION" AND TRADING IN </p><p>DERIVATIVES--EVEN "EMPLOYING COMPUTERS" TO MAKE </p><p>"SOPHISTICATED CALCULATIONS"--HAD BECOME </p><p>COMMONPLACE.  CASTRO CITED THE COLLAPSE OF THE LONG </p><p>TERM CAPITAL FUND IN WHICH "TWO NOBEL PRIZE WINNERS </p><p>IN ECONOMY AND SOME OF THE BEST PROGRAMMERS IN THE </p><p>WORLD" COMBINED TO BRING THE FUND TO THE VERGE OF </p><p>FINANCIAL COLLAPSE, THE CONSEQUENCES OF WHICH WERE </p><p>"INCALCULABLE." </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  ALSO NOTEWORTHY IN CASTROS REMARKS WAS HIS </p><p>CALL FOR THE THIRD WORLDS (PRESUMABLY INCLUDING </p><p>CUBA) PROBLEMS TO BE RESOLVED FROM OUTSIDE.  "THERE </p><p>ISNT THE MOST MINIMAL IDEA OF HOW TO RESOLVE THE </p><p>THIRD WORLDS PROBLEMS."  "WHERE ARE THE CONSUMERS OF </p><p>THE THIRD WORLDS PRODUCTS?"  CASTRO SAID THE </p><p>UNITED NATIONS, PROVIDED IT "PUTS AN END TO THE </p><p>DICTATORSHIP OF THE SECURITY COUNCIL", COULD HELP </p><p>PROGRAM WORLD DEVELOPMENT.  CERTAINLY, SAID CASTRO, </p><p>THAT RESPONSIBILITY CANNOT BE "IN THE HANDS OF </p><p>MULTINATIONALS AND IN THE BLIND AND CHAOTIC LAWS OF </p><p>THE MARKET."  CASTRO ADDED THAT THE AUTHORITY OF THE </p><p>U.N. GENERAL ASSEMBLY SHOULD BE BROADENED. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  COMMENT:  CASTROS SPEECH IS TYPICAL IN ITS </p><p>FOCUS ON TWO CURRENT THEMES: THE "MILITARY MIRACLE" </p><p>OF HIS REVOLUTIONS OVERTHROW OF THE BATISTA </p><p>GOVERNMENT, AND THE "INEVITABLE" GLOBAL FINANCIAL </p><p>COLLAPSE BROUGHT ON BY UNBRIDLED FREEDOM OF THE </p><p>GLOBAL CAPITALIST SYSTEM.  WITH LITTLE TO OFFER IN </p><p>DOMESTIC ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE, CASTRO (AGAIN) </p><p>CONCENTRATED HIS REMARKS ON THE CERTAINTY OF THE PAST </p><p>AND PLAYED ON FEARS OF A WORLD ECONOMIC CRISIS TO </p><p>VINDICATE THE CORRECTNESS OF HIS OWN INSISTENCE ON </p><p>RETAINING A SOVIET STYLE COMMAND ECONOMY.  HIS </p><p>REMARKS COMMEMORATING THE REVOLUTIONS 40TH </p><p>ANNIVERSARY GIVE LITTLE ROOM FOR HOPE THAT HE IS </p><p>PREPARING FOR ADDITIONAL MARKET ORIENTED REFORMS. </p><p>APPARENTLY WE WILL HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL THE CUBAN </p><p>ECONOMY AGAIN REACHES THE SORT OF DIRE SITUATION IT </p><p>FACED IN 1994 BEFORE CASTRO AND HIS REACTIONARY </p><p>COLLEAGUES WILL BE FORCED TO COME TO TERMS WITH THE </p><p>NEED FOR REFORM.  NOTE:  FOR ANOTHER RECENT EXAMPLE </p><p>OF GOC SPEECHMAKING REMOVED FROM REALITY, SEE </p><p>NATIONAL ASSEMBLY PRESIDENT RICARDO ALARCONS SPEECH </p><p>ENDING THE ASSEMBLYS MOST RECENT SESSION (REFTEL). </p><p> </p><p>KOZAK </p><p></p></div>
