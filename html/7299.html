<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HO CHI MINH CITY 000342 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EAP/BCLTV, EAP/PD, EAP/P, DRL </p><p> </p><p>E. O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PREL, SOCI, PGOV, VM, HUMANR </p><p>SUBJECT: HARASSED UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE:  DON DUONG AND FAMILY </p><p>DEPART </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED - PROTECT ACCORDINGLY </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary:  Actor Bui Don Duong, his wife, and their two </p><p>sons departed Ho Chi Minh City today on the first leg of their </p><p>journey to the U.S. as intending immigrants.  Up to the last </p><p>minute, GVN security forces delayed and humiliated the family at </p><p>Tan Son Nhut Airport, almost causing them to miss their flight. </p><p>ConGenoffs were also hassled and prevented from observing portions </p><p>of the departure process.  In a deviation from past practice on </p><p>diplomatic airport access, ConGenoffs were variously told: 1) they </p><p>could only see off a national of their own country; 2) the Customs </p><p>area was now off limits (it wasn\'t last Friday); and 3) the </p><p>Immigration area was now off limits (again, it wasn\'t last </p><p>Friday).  Suggested press guidance para 10.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Ending a protracted ordeal that included police </p><p>questioning, emotional media attacks, telephone harassment, </p><p>passport confiscation, being blackballed for employment, having </p><p>his children bullied at school, and vandalism against his sister\'s </p><p>restaurant in HCMC, Don Duong and family departed HCMC on EVA Air </p><p>392 to Taipei on April 9.  From there, they will connect to the </p><p>West Coast of the U.S., where they will be reunited with the </p><p>actor\'s sister and immigrant visa sponsor, Susie Bui. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) After an initial wave of critical media coverage </p><p>("besmirched his country\'s honor", "traitor to Vietnamese ideals," </p><p>etc.) and police summons for questioning in September-October </p><p>2002, harassment and pressure "to apologize" had become somewhat </p><p>sporadic during November 2002-February 2003.  During that time, </p><p>however, Don Duong\'s children were subjected to schoolyard </p><p>taunting and accusations.  He was unable to get any work as an </p><p>actor.  Contracts he had were broken.  Permission to travel </p><p>overseas to represent Vietnam at film festivals was denied, and </p><p>his passport was confiscated. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) On his fourth try to apply for a new passport, Don Duong </p><p>was successful - but only after he signed a written pledge </p><p>promising not to knowingly violate any published Vietnamese laws </p><p>and regulations.  This new passport was issued on March 17. </p><p>Having already "pre-processed" the family as much as possible, </p><p>remaining visa interviews and formalities were completed on March </p><p>19.  At that time Don Duong\'s intention was to immigrate - as a </p><p>normal immigrant - to the U.S. at the end of his sons\' Vietnamese </p><p>school year in May. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) The next week, renewed harassment began.  Media stories </p><p>began appearing about Don Duong\'s "selling out to Hollywood and </p><p>American dollars."  The equivalent of agent provocateurs came to </p><p>his sister\'s restaurant, slashing pictures, refusing to pay, </p><p>talking loudly about Don Duong\'s betrayal of his country, and </p><p>picking fights with wait staff.  If Don Duong happened to be </p><p>visiting his sister or eating at the restaurant, these "customers" </p><p>would invite him for a drink - criticizing him for being "uppity </p><p>and arrogant" if he declined, but trying to provoke him into </p><p>saying something negative about the GVN if he sat down to chat. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) Two weeks ago a friend with contacts in the military </p><p>told Don Duong that the Army had opened a "new file" on him, and </p><p>was looking for something to catch him on.  It was then that Don </p><p>Duong decided to move up his departure date.  The news about the </p><p>"new file" was followed by more staged incidents at the sister\'s </p><p>restaurant, one of which resulted in Don Duong being summoned to </p><p>his local ward police station on April 7.  Claiming that he was </p><p>busy preparing for his trip to the U.S., he asked the police for a </p><p>later appointment, and was simply told to come whenever he </p><p>finished packing (he never went). </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) On April 9, ConGenoffs were allowed the usual access to </p><p>Tan Son Nhut Airport at the first checkpoint.  However, a </p><p>cameraman allegedly from Vietnam TV, was filming Don Duong\'s </p><p>arrival, and followed the family through each departure </p><p>checkpoint.  At the Customs checkpoint, ConGenoffs were refused </p><p>access with the various excuses: a) you are not seeing off a </p><p>national of your own country; b) the Customs area is now off </p><p>limits; and c) the Immigration area is now off limits too.  When </p><p>it was pointed out to them that just last Friday a ConGenoff had </p><p>had unimpeded access to those areas, in accordance with past </p><p>practice, the Customs Police simply shrugged their shoulders and </p><p>said the policy had changed.  Two supervisors were summoned, but </p><p>it turned out that one of them was the officer who would direct a </p><p>slow and ever so comprehensive baggage search. </p><p>An Australian ConGen colleague who joined ConGenoffs was also </p><p>denied permission to enter the customs area. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) Although unable to enter the Customs area, ConGenoffs </p><p>were able to see Don Duoung and his family escorted into a small </p><p>room where at least eight customs officers opened up their six </p><p>large suitcases and three large boxes.  The officers examined </p><p>every article inside the luggage.  They took several photos of the </p><p>contents, holding up underwear to the light.  After an hour of </p><p>searching, the Customs officers allowed the family and other </p><p>airport staff to repack the bags and boxes, put them through the X- </p><p>ray machines once more, and onto the luggage trolley.  Don Duong </p><p>was taken to a separate counter, where he was apparently required </p><p>to sign more papers (promising what we do not know). </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU) EVA Airlines held the flight for 15 minutes to enable </p><p>Don Duong and his family to board.  The family was never paged for </p><p>the last call, as is common practice at Tan Son Nhut.  Through a </p><p>glass window on the International Arrivals side of the airport, </p><p>ConGenoff was able to observe the family going down the Departure </p><p>Lobby corridor, directly to the gate and jetway.  The "cameraman" </p><p>continued filming until the last moment, while a large contingent </p><p>of security officials blanketed the boarding lobby.  EVA Air #392 </p><p>departed at 13:15, with Don Duong and family on board. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U) Suggested press guidance on an if asked basis: </p><p> </p><p>Q:  Is it true that the movie actor Don Duong was able to depart </p><p>Vietnam today?  What is his status? </p><p> </p><p>A:  Yes, Don Duong and his family departed Vietnam on April 9 </p><p>local time.  They are beneficiaries of an immigrant visa petition. </p><p> </p><p>Q:  How was he treated at the airport?  Do you know? </p><p> </p><p>A:  Officers from our Consulate General in Ho Chi Minh City </p><p>observed harassment.  We find this harassment to be regrettable. </p><p>We will continue to urge the Vietnamese Government - in public and </p><p>private -- to respect human rights, including freedom of artistic </p><p>expression, which is an essential component for a strong, </p><p>prosperous democratic society. </p><p> </p><p>It would be extremely regrettable if the Government of Vietnam </p><p>misdirected any of its displeasure toward any members of Don </p><p>Duong\'s or his wife\'s families who remain in Vietnam. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (SBU) Press Guidance Background:  Don Duong is a Vietnamese </p><p>actor who had roles in two American films - "We Were Soldiers </p><p>Once" about the Vietnam War and "Green Dragon" about Vietnamese </p><p>refugees in the U.S.  Vietnamese state media, the military, and </p><p>other GVN officials have criticized him for besmirching the </p><p>country\'s honor by his portrayals of a Vietnamese army colonel in </p><p>"We Were Soldiers Once" and as a sympathetic refugee coordinator </p><p>in "Green Dragon."  Actors Mel Gibson and Forrest Whittaker, and </p><p>film director Randall Wallace - among others - have inquired about </p><p>Don Duong\'s situation in Vietnam.  For nearly eight months he was </p><p>blackballed for employment, harassed by the police, and victimized </p><p>by officially-directed media attacks.  He was virtually driven out </p><p>of his homeland. </p><p> </p><p>YAMAUCHI </p><p></p></div>
