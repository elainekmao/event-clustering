<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 LAGOS 000104 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/27/2007 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, KDEM, KISL, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: CONVERSATION WITH FORMER INFORMATION </p><p>MINISTER PRINCE MOMOH </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: CONSUL GENERAL ROBYN HINSON-JONES FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>D (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  Summary. Prince Tony Momoh, former Minister of </p><p>Information and Culture, successful public relations </p><p>consultant and influential political columnist for the </p><p>"Vanguard" newspaper says that the Shari\'a law case of Amina </p><p>Lawal will be decided in Lawal\'s favor.  He believes there </p><p>was an inevitable political aspect to the rioting between </p><p>Christians and Muslims around the Miss World Contest. He was </p><p>tapped to be Director of Publicity for, Dr. Alex Ekwueme, who </p><p>until he was defeated at the party convention on January 3, </p><p>was the most credible challenger to President Obasanjo within </p><p>the People\'s Democratic Party (PDP).  Momoh is cautiously </p><p>bullish on the Nigerian economy and political scene and </p><p>believes structural changes will solve most problems.  End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Culture and Islam </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) In an hour-long, wide-ranging meeting with PolOffs, </p><p>Prince Anthony Sulaiman Macnonoh Momoh, lawyer, journalist, </p><p>businessman and former Minister of Information and Culture </p><p>(1986-90) gave his views on a number of subjects.  He was </p><p>eager to share his views on the Lawal case (Note: Amina </p><p>Lawal, a Nigerian Muslim woman, was convicted of adultery and </p><p>condemned to death by stoning by a Islamic court in Nigeria </p><p>this year.  Her case is on appeal.  End note.)   Momoh, a </p><p>Muslim, stated that Muslims in the North were "embarrassed" </p><p>by the world and media reaction to the Lawal case.  He said </p><p>that there had "always" been stonings for adultery in Muslim </p><p>communities in Nigeria.  "It is the local way of dealing with </p><p>crime and maintaining discipline," he said.  "In Edo State, </p><p>in the Muslim community where I was raised, there were </p><p>stonings for adultery and women were driven out of the </p><p>community or severely ostracized for lesser infractions," he </p><p>continued. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Momoh explained that there are actually three judicial </p><p>systems in Nigeria: one modeled on British common law, one </p><p>based on Islamic law and one following "customary" or African </p><p>indigenous law.  All these courts are officially and </p><p>constitutionally recognized in Nigeria and all are subject, </p><p>again under the Nigerian Constitution, to review by the </p><p>Supreme Court.  "Customary" law courts are the Southern </p><p>equivalent to Shari\'a (Islamic) courts in the North, and one </p><p>is no worse nor any better than the other.  Momoh pointed out </p><p>that, even today, Igbo women in many Southern States have few </p><p>rights under customary law and are themselves considered </p><p>property of male family members under this law.   "Everyone </p><p>knows that the Lawal case will be decided by the Supreme </p><p>Court and death by stoning is clearly unconstitutional in </p><p>Nigeria. This case is a media and public relations phenomena </p><p>and Muslims in the North are embarrassed by the attention </p><p>focused on a long-time, accepted practice."  He concluded </p><p>saying that media focus on a particular issue can shape </p><p>history.  "If CNN had been around in the 1960s, Biafra would </p><p>be a reality today." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Politics and Islam </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  Momoh also had strong views on the political </p><p>implications of the recent religious rioting and killings </p><p>that had led to the cancellation of the staging of the Miss </p><p>World Contest in Nigeria.  The riots left 200 people dead and </p><p>hundreds more injured when Muslims reacted to a newspaper </p><p>editorial that reportedly insulted the Prophet Mohamed.  He </p><p>said "Northern Muslims were looking for a reason to start </p><p>violent protests against the current administration and, if </p><p>it hadn\'t been the Miss World Contest, it would have been </p><p>something else."  According to Momoh, the Obasanjo </p><p>administration and the ruling People\'s Democratic Party (PDP) </p><p>that came into power in 1999 needed alliance with a second </p><p>party to cement their power.  As the Alliance for Democracy </p><p>(AD) had a firm hold on the Southwest, the PDP turned to the </p><p>All Nigerian People\'s Party (ANPP) that is strongest in the </p><p>Northwest.  The PDP offered to support the ANPP in pushing </p><p>Shari\'a law as a replacement for the British-derived criminal </p><p>code in several Northern States.  Momoh says that, "The North </p><p>made Babangida and Obasanjo, and they (the Northerners) were </p><p>promised much by both men.  Now that Obasanjo has clearly </p><p>failed to live up to many of the promises made to the North, </p><p>they are out to obstruct his every move and crush his every </p><p>plan."  He continued that the rioting was politically </p><p>motivated and "the rioters were obviously not even people who </p><p>could or would read newspapers."  The PDP is now scrambling </p><p>to try to win back Northern Muslims by introducing Shari\'a </p><p>legislation, but, says Momoh, "Shari\'a has become a political </p><p>weapon that will swallow up the current leadership." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Elections </p><p>5.  (C) Turning to the subject of the 2003 legislative, </p><p>gubernatorial and presidential elections, Momoh was </p><p>absolutely certain that there will be much election-related </p><p>violence as elections approach.  "Nigerians are ruthless and </p><p>relentless businessmen.  Politics in Nigeria is a business </p><p>and so violence is a part of both business and politics </p><p>here," he said.  Nigerians need to understand politics as </p><p>government serving the people and not a business where each </p><p>man is out to get as much for himself as fast as he can from </p><p>the public coffers.   He said the decision by the courts to </p><p>force the Independent National Elections Commission (INEC) to </p><p>legalize additional political parties was clear from the </p><p>beginning.  First, because the Constitution does not allow </p><p>citizens to run as independents, and, second, because it </p><p>empowers INEC only to document registration of parties and </p><p>not to make rules for the structure of parties.  Momoh said </p><p>that the current over thirty political parties will winnow </p><p>down to two or three through alliance and coalition, and will </p><p>eventually become a liberal left and conservative right as in </p><p>the US.  He concluded, saying that the party conventions to </p><p>chose candidates to be held in January, will merely be </p><p>"rubber stamps of the already rigged primaries.  Whoever is </p><p>named at the conventions will be the winners."  (Comment. </p><p>Charges of fixing, tampering and rigging were leveled at </p><p>party primaries in several states and some primaries were </p><p>annulled by the national parties. End comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A President from an ethnic minority </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C)  (Comment.  Momoh was the Director of Publicity for </p><p>both political efforts of former vice president (1979-83), </p><p>Dr. Alex Ifeanyichukwu Ekwueme.  Ekwueme\'s latest attempt to </p><p>challenge Obasanjo for the Presidency met defeat at the </p><p>January 3-5 PDP convention when Obasanjo was chosen as the </p><p>party\'s candidate. Momoh met with us in December on the day </p><p>Ekwueme announced his candidacy.  End comment.)   Momoh was </p><p>adamant that the South-south must produce the next President </p><p>of Nigeria.  "This is not negotiable," he stated, echoing </p><p>many prominent politicians and hopefuls from the Southeast </p><p>and South-south.  He explained that the Nigerian Constitution </p><p>clearly states that no one region of the country can </p><p>monopolize the Presidency.  The Presidency must rotate after </p><p>a President from a particular region has served two four-year </p><p>terms. As it turned out, the Presidency will probably remain </p><p>in the south, but the southwest to be exact, with the </p><p>nomination of Obasanjo. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Corruption and economic progress </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  Corruption in government and politics is not just a </p><p>Nigerian problem, it is a human problem.  "Citizens are not </p><p>taught to serve today," Momoh said.  "They just take and </p><p>never give anything back to society."  He pointed out that a </p><p>government employee with the title of "Counselor" makes </p><p>500,000 Nigerian naira per month (equivalent to approximately </p><p>4,000 USD.)  The attraction to the average citizen is clear </p><p>in a country where the annual per capita income is only 300 </p><p>USD.  "We have become too materialistic," he continued, "and </p><p>no one believes that heaven is the reward.  Everyone wants </p><p>everything here and now.  If you are not a millionaire, you </p><p>are a failure."  Momoh believes that government and, </p><p>consequently politics, must be "decongested."  He, as have </p><p>others, wants  less federal government and more power and </p><p>authority devolved to the local level.  He says that the </p><p>Nigerian people are not used to a federal, centralized type </p><p>government and need to be educated and mobilized at the grass </p><p>roots by local leaders.  He contends that corruption will die </p><p>if local authorities are allowed to handle their own affairs </p><p>and funds.  "The only failing areas in Nigeria are those that </p><p>are government controlled.  Nigerians are energetic, </p><p>business-oriented and know how to handle their own affairs." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Comment.  Momoh is still a voice to be reckoned with </p><p>as he writes a regular column of political and cultural </p><p>commentary for the influential "Vanguard" newspaper as well </p><p>as runs his own successful public relations firm.  He is also </p><p>a lawyer and enthusiastic supporter of building democracy and </p><p>a civil society in Nigeria.  He jokingly said that since he </p><p>is one of his father\'s 265 children (from multiple wives), he </p><p>was thinking of forming his own Momoh family political party </p><p>to deal with issues he considers important for the future of </p><p>Nigeria.  Despite his occasional bleak tone, Momoh is </p><p>optimistic about Nigeria\'s future and sees Nigeria eventually </p><p>succeeding.  He told us Nigeria is following much the same </p><p>path to democracy that the US did. He said, "Nigeria is the </p><p>other part of America, only on this side of the Atlantic." </p><p>HINSON-JONES </p><p></p></div>
