<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 004786 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>USTR FOR NOVELLI/SAUMS </p><p>USDOC FOR 4520/ITA/MAC/ONE/PTHANOS </p><p>USDOC FOR TECHNOLOGY ADMINISTRATION - KEN FERGUSON </p><p>OPIC FOR TARBUSH/COWAN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: BEXP, ECPS, ECON, IS, JO, OPIC </p><p>SUBJECT: U.S. FIRM INTERESTED IN CALL CENTERS IN JORDAN </p><p> </p><p>1.  (u)  Summary.  In an initiative that it sees both as </p><p>a promising business venture and an element of support </p><p>for regional peace, the U.S. firm Stream International </p><p>is seriously looking at Jordan as a site for an </p><p>international call service center that would employ over </p><p>300 technically skilled Jordanian workers.  Modeled on a </p><p>venture in northern Ireland, the initiative could </p><p>eventually be expanded to the West Bank and Gaza. </p><p>Stream says that if it irons out some technical details, </p><p>including telecommunications support, the project could </p><p>be up and running next year.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (u)  Craig Weinstein, Director of Corporate Services </p><p>of Massachusetts-based Stream International, visited </p><p>Amman in early August to assess the potential of Jordan </p><p>as a site for one of Stream\'s international call service </p><p>centers (call centers).  Stream, a subsidiary of the </p><p>U.S. electronics giant Solectron, currently has such </p><p>centers in 24 U.S. and foreign locations, including </p><p>Londonderry and Mumbai.  These facilities serve clients </p><p>that include companies like Dell, Hewlett Packard, </p><p>Microsoft and Morgan Stanley by providing centers that </p><p>customers can call or email for technical and other </p><p>service support.  In Jordan\'s case, a center would </p><p>service Arabic-speaking callers from the region as well </p><p>as English-speaking callers from North America and </p><p>Europe. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (u)  Weinstein said that his company\'s interest in </p><p>Jordan and the region more broadly was an outgrowth of </p><p>its association with peace through economic development </p><p>initiatives in northern Ireland.  He cited Senator </p><p>Mitchell and the U.S. American International Group (AIG) </p><p>as supporters of this work.  (The Ambassador had </p><p>received an introductory letter for Weinstein from </p><p>American International Group Vice Chairman Frank </p><p>Wisner.)  Weinstein said that if the project was </p><p>successful in Jordan, he foresaw similar operations in </p><p>the West Bank and Gaza, the political environment </p><p>permitting. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (u)  Weinstein, whose visit was coordinated by the </p><p>palace\'s economic division and the local Century </p><p>Investment Group, told the Ambassador and econ chief how </p><p>he was impressed by the infrastructure he found in </p><p>Jordan.  This included a favorable business climate, a </p><p>good telecommunications infrastructure, and the </p><p>availability of educated, technically-inclined and </p><p>English-speaking potential employees.  The project </p><p>involves a substantial training component for 300-400 </p><p>potential employees.  This includes training in call </p><p>center management as well as in the technical subjects </p><p>on which employees would provide phone support.  While </p><p>further discussions were needed, Weinstein thought </p><p>Stream could move relatively quickly, with </p><p>groundbreaking later this year and a start-up in the </p><p>first half of 2003.  The next steps will be discussed at </p><p>a Solectron board of directors meeting in September and </p><p>a conference in November at Ulster University that will </p><p>review linkages between northern Ireland and the Middle </p><p>East. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (u)  Among the issues requiring further discussion </p><p>is access to telecommunications.  Weinstein said he had </p><p>had positive discussions with the Minister of </p><p>Telecommunications and Jordan Telecom (JT) about using </p><p>(JT\'s) fiber optic links to Europe to carry the volume </p><p>of telecom traffic initially expected.  Eventually, </p><p>however, calls would have to be managed through a </p><p>company-wide voice over IP network.  Voice over IP, </p><p>however, is not currently permitted in Jordan in order </p><p>to protect Jordan Telecom\'s international gateway </p><p>monopoly.  Although the issue is being studied by both </p><p>Jordan Telecom and by the new telecom regulator, this </p><p>could therefore require some policy innovation. </p><p>However, Weinstein did not think this would be a major </p><p>obstacle, as a new closed network would not detract from </p><p>the volume of Jordan Telecom\'s traffic.  We also called </p><p>to his attention the fiber optic backbone project being </p><p>developed by Seattle-based Real Time Communications. </p><p>Berry </p><p></p></div>
