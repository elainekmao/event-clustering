<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 RANGOON 000707 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP AND INL </p><p>DEA FOR OF, OFF </p><p>CDR USPACOM FOR FPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/16/2013 </p><p>TAGS: SNAR, KCRM, PINS, BM </p><p>SUBJECT: BURMA\'S OPIUM FIELDS -- GOING, GOING, .... </p><p> </p><p>REF: RANGOON 575 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: COM Carmen Martinez. Reason: 1.5 (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: According to information presented by UNODC\'s </p><p>Resident Representative, Burma eliminated approximately </p><p>one-quarter of its opium fields in 2003.  According to </p><p>UNODC\'s latest survey, the acreage under opium cultivation in </p><p>Burma in 2003 totaled only 62,100 hectares, down 24 percent </p><p>from 2002.  The reduction, according to UNODC, was equivalent </p><p>to the entire current crop in Laos. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Acreage under Cultivation </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) UNODC will release its worldwide opium survey in New </p><p>York next week.  In a pre-brief on June 13, UNODC\'s Resident </p><p>Representative told the Chief of Mission that opium </p><p>cultivation in Burma had again declined radically.  According </p><p>to UNODC\'s survey, the acreage under opium cultivation in </p><p>Burma in 2003 totaled only 62,100 hectares, down 24 percent </p><p>from 2002 and more than 60 percent from the 163,000 hectares </p><p>planted in Burma in 1996.  The Resident Representative noted </p><p>that the reduction in acreage under cultivation in Burma in </p><p>2003 was equivalent to Laos\' entire current crop. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) According to UNODC\'s numbers, the reduction was </p><p>sharpest in northern Shan State, where acreage under opium </p><p>cultivation was down 45 percent. In eastern Shan state, the </p><p>reduction was 26 percent; in southern Shan State 19 percent. </p><p>Only in the Wa territories did acreage under cultivation </p><p>increase.  While the acreage under opium cultivation was down </p><p>in the Wa Alternative Development Project area around Mong </p><p>Yang and Mong Pawk (by about 12 percent), in the Wa </p><p>territories as a whole, acreage under cultivation was up 21 </p><p>percent to 21,300 hectares (i.e., about one-third of Burma\'s </p><p>total production.) </p><p> </p><p>Yield/Hectare </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Largely offsetting the decline in acreage, however, </p><p>was a sharp increase in yield, thanks to excellent weather. </p><p>According to UNODC, the yield/hectare throughout Burma was up </p><p>about 27 percent from 10.2 kilograms per hectare to 12.9 </p><p>kilograms per hectare.  As with acreage under cultivation, </p><p>yields were also highest in the Wa territories at about 16.1 </p><p>kilograms per hectare. </p><p> </p><p>Production </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Overall production, finally, came in at about par with </p><p>2002, as increased yields per hectare approximately offset </p><p>the decline in acreage under cultivation.  According to </p><p>UNODC\'s numbers, Burma produced about 810 metric tons of </p><p>opium in 2003, down only marginally from the 828 metric tons </p><p>UNODC estimated in 2002. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) A couple of points stand out from UNODC\'s survey. </p><p>First, the weather for opium production was excellent for </p><p>opium production in Burma in 2003.  There was no drought. </p><p>Yet acreage under production declined radically, most </p><p>logically as a result of government efforts. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Secondly, in 2003, the government held the cease-fire </p><p>groups to their pledges regarding opium. In fact the largest </p><p>declines in 2003 took place in territories controlled by the </p><p>Peng Kya Shin\'s Kokang Chinese, which had pledged to be out </p><p>of opium production by 2000, and then reneged.  In 2003, </p><p>thanks to Burmese government pressure, the acreage under </p><p>cultivation in the Kokang Chinese capital district of Lawkai </p><p>was cut to barely 20 percent of its 2002 level. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Finally, in 2005 the government will get another </p><p>opportunity to show if it is really ready to take on the the </p><p>ceasefire groups.  As matters now stand, 2005 is to be the </p><p>last year of opium production in the Wa territories.  End </p><p>Comment. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
