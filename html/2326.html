<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 003236 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: KISL, OEXC, PGOV, PREL, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA - THE AMBASSADOR\'S IFTAR </p><p> </p><p>1.  Ambassador Jeter hosted a very successful </p><p>Iftar on Wednesday, December 12.  Although FSOs </p><p>assigned to the (former) Embassy Office in Abuja </p><p>had hosted Iftars in the past, Ambassador Jeter </p><p>was the first U.S. Ambassador accredited to </p><p>Nigeria to host an Iftar in the national </p><p>capital.  I sent a strong message of goodwill to </p><p>the Nigeria Muslim community and served as part </p><p>of a larger effort to build mutual trust. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  Attendees included several Ministers, </p><p>Presidential Advisors, and the Inspector-General </p><p>of Police, as well as three key figures in the </p><p>nexus between Islam and Nigeria\'s broader civil </p><p>society:  Justice Bashir Sambo, a renowned </p><p>Islamic jurist and author who serves as </p><p>Secretary of Jama\'atu Nasril Islam (JNI), the </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>largest Muslim civic group in Nigeria; </p><p>AbdulMumin Bello; a leading official of the </p><p>Islam in Africa Organization (IAO); Dr. Hadi </p><p>Dahiru Bauchi, a Koranic radio commentator and </p><p>son of Sheikh Dahiru Bauchi, one of the most </p><p>influential scholars of Islam in Nigeria today; </p><p>and Kabiru Yusuf, editor-in-chief of the "Trust" </p><p>newspapers, the most influential print media in </p><p>northern Nigeria.  "Trust" and most of its </p><p>columnists have generally responded with </p><p>skepticism to and sometimes rejected outright </p><p>USG explanations for actions and policy in the </p><p>war on terrorism.  Most of the Ambassadors and </p><p>High Commissioners from Islamic countries who </p><p>were in Abuja attended as well. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  Guests were impressed with (in some cases </p><p>pleasantly surprised by) the authenticity of the </p><p>event -- from the provisions for a prayer area </p><p>to the mix of Middle Eastern and traditional </p><p>Nigerian fast-breaking food and drink.  A number </p><p>stayed hours beyond the anticipated end of the </p><p>event to talk about issues of the day, availing </p><p>themselves of the prayer area for Isha\'i as well </p><p>as Magrib prayers.  The Ambassador\'s welcoming </p><p>remarks elicited a positive response from </p><p>Justice Sambo, deputized by other guests to </p><p>reply.  Sambo emphasized the importance of </p><p>events such as the Ambassador\'s Iftar to </p><p>building inter-cultural awareness and </p><p>understanding.  He recalled how much he </p><p>benefited from a 1998 USIS-sponsored program of </p><p>travel to the U.S. that included Archbishop of </p><p>Abuja John O. Onaiyekan.  Sambo said the number </p><p>of guests would have been far greater but for </p><p>the fact that many prominent Muslims had </p><p>traveled to Saudi Arabia for Umra.  He </p><p>emphasized the importance of contact and </p><p>dialogue, saying,"There is a lot of ignorance </p><p>and mistrust among us.  The real terrorist we </p><p>need to fight is ignorance." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  Justice Sambo made it clear he expected the </p><p>U.S. Ambassador\'s Iftar to become a tradition. </p><p>We anticipate doing just that, but with some </p><p>modifications.  First, we plan to arrange a </p><p>separate women\'s Iftar next year.  There was </p><p>insufficient time to arrange two Iftars this </p><p>year.  While some in the Mission felt women </p><p>should be included in the Iftar, our senior </p><p>Muslim FSNs unanimously opposed the idea, saying </p><p>that some invitees would feel the Embassy was </p><p>trying to "impose" Western norms.  Since the </p><p>major purpose of this event was to demonstrate </p><p>respect for Islam and for the culture and norms </p><p>of northern Nigeria, we chose to make this a </p><p>male-only event.  Second, the Ambassador Iftar </p><p>should be held mid-way through Ramadan in order </p><p>to make certain we do not miss prominent </p><p>personalities Who may be performing Unra. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  There was considerable interest in and </p><p>discussion of U.S. policy toward the Middle East </p><p>-- particularly in respect of the conflict </p><p>between Palestinians and Israel.  The Mission </p><p>will by septel seek support for a speaker on </p><p>this subject. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.   One of the guests decided just before </p><p>leaving that the Ambassador and DCM should join </p><p>in the Eid El-Fitr call on President Obasanjo. </p><p>The call, preceded by brunch at the home of Vice </p><p>President Atiku Abubakar, took place on </p><p>Saturday, December 15.  The Ambassador and DCM </p><p>were the only diplomats present in a group that </p><p>included essentially all of the senior Muslim </p><p>figures in Abuja that day. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  The Vice President told the Ambassador how </p><p>greatful he was that we had come to this </p><p>important event and; President Obansanjo </p><p>publicly thanked the Ambassador and DCM before </p><p>the entire assemble group and the media. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
