(U) SUMMARY:  DURING A MARCH 1-3 TRIP TO THE CENTRAL </p><p>HIGHLANDS, CONGENOFFS MET WITH VILLAGERS IN TWO DAK LAK </p><p>COMMUNITIES AND VISITED A PROTESTANT WORSHIP HOUSE IN ONE </p><p>OF THE COMMUNITIES.  SEVERAL OF THE VILLAGERS WERE ETHNIC </p><p>MINORITY VIETNAMESE RETURNEES FROM CAMBODIA -- TWO OF WHOM </p><p>HAD RETURNED ON THEIR OWN, PRIOR TO UNHCR REPATRIATION. </p><p>ONE FAMILY HAD BEEN TURNED BACK TO VIETNAM AT THE BORDER. </p><p>NONE CLAIMED ANY MISTREATMENT AT THE HANDS OF VIETNAMESE </p><p>AUTHORITIES UPON THEIR RETURN, THOUGH ONE SAID OTHER </p><p>VILLAGERS HAD TAUNTED HER.  THERE WAS ONE DETAILED </p><p>COMPLAINT ABOUT A LAND DISPUTE.  BECAUSE THE VILLAGERS DID </p><p>NOT SPEAK MUCH VIETNAMESE, CONGENOFFS HAD TO RELY ON THE </p><p>VILLAGE CHIEF AND A VILLAGE INTERPRETER TO HELP WITH </p><p>TRANSLATION.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>THE RETURNEE WHO CAME IN FROM THE COLD </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) IN DAK LAK PROVINCE, CG EMI LYNN YAMAUCHI AND FSN </p><p>POL/ECON ASSISTANT MET WITH Y THAT, AN ETHNIC MNONG BHER </p><p>MALE.  HE HAD RETURNED TO YUN YUH VILLAGE ON FEBRUARY 16, </p><p>2001, WITHOUT ASSISTANCE FROM UNHCR (WHOSE FIRST GROUP OF </p><p>REPATRIATES TO VIETNAM RETURNED ON FEBRUARY 19).  THE </p><p>VILLAGE CHIEF AND ANOTHER VILLAGER WHOSE RELATIVES WERE </p><p>STILL IN CAMBODIA ALSO ATTENDED THIS MEETING. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) ACCORDING TO Y THAT, HE WAS "LURED AWAY BY BAD </p><p>PEOPLE" AND CROSSED THE BORDER TO CAMBODIA, 15 KM AWAY. </p><p>THE "BAD PERSON\'S" NAME WAS MA CHEL.  HE HAD LEFT HIS </p><p>COFFEE FIELDS, WIFE AND FOUR CHILDREN BEHIND. Y THAT STAYED </p><p>IN THE MONDOLKIRI CAMP, BUT AS FAR AS HE KNEW, HIS CAMP HAD </p><p>RECEIVED NO VISITORS FROM VIETNAM, CAMBODIA, OR THE U.S. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HO CHI  00203  01 OF 03  041656Z </p><p>NOW THAT HE WAS BACK IN YUN YUH, HE WAS HAPPY.  HIS FRIENDS </p><p>CAME TO VISIT HIM AND HE WAS TREATED WELL UPON HIS RETURN. </p><p>Y THAT SPORTED A CRISPLY-IRONED, PINK SHORT-SLEEVED SHIRT, </p><p>KHAKI SHORTS, AND NUMEROUS TATTOOS ON HIS FOREARMS.  HE </p><p>OFFERED TO SHOW CONGENOFFS HIS HOME, WHICH WAS MODEST, BUT </p><p>FULL OF "FRIENDS".  THE COFFEE TABLE FEATURED FAMILY PHOTOS </p><p>UNDER THE GLASS TOP. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Y SER, THE VILLAGE CHIEF SINCE 1987, RESPONDED TO </p><p>QUESTIONS FROM THE CG.  HE STATED THAT ECONOMIC AND LIVING </p><p>STANDARDS HAD BEEN IMPROVING IN YUN YUH UNTIL AROUND 1999. </p><p>THE VILLAGE MAINLY CULTIVATES COFFEE AND HAS NOT STARTED TO </p><p>DIVERSIFY ITS CROPS.  IT HAS A POPULATION OF 811, OF WHOM </p><p>"750 ARE BELIEVERS WHO HAVE THEIR OWN WORSHIP HOUSE". </p><p>THERE IS NO RESIDENT PASTOR, WHICH IS WHY THEIR WORSHIP </p><p>HOUSE CANNOT BE CALLED A CHURCH.  THE VILLAGE HAD HAD A </p><p>PEACEFUL, "NORMAL" CHRISTMAS, WITH LARGE ATTENDANCE AT THE </p><p>WORSHIP HOUSE SERVICES. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) ACCORDING TO VILLAGE CHIEF Y SER, 64 VILLAGERS - </p><p>INCLUDING ENTIRE FAMILIES - HAD LEFT YUN YUH LAST SPRING. </p><p>HE DISCOVERED THIS WHEN PEOPLE DID NOT SHOW UP FOR WORSHIP </p><p>SERVICES AND FROM "CAMBODIAN TRADERS WHO HAD TOLD (HIM) </p><p>THEY HAD SEEN SOME OF (HIS) PEOPLE OVER IN CAMBODIA."  Y </p><p>SER SAID THERE HAD BEEN NO HINT OF PROBLEMS PRIOR TO THEIR </p><p>DEPARTURE.  WHILE HE HAD HEARD THAT OTHER VILLAGES "HAD </p><p>LOST" PEOPLE, HE BELIEVED HIS VILLAGE HAD LOST THE MOST. </p><p>YUN YUH VILLAGE HAS ELECTRICITY AND IRRIGATION.  THERE IS </p><p>AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, WITH INSTRUCTION IN VIETNAMESE BY </p><p>VIETNAMESE KINH TEACHERS. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HO CHI  00203  01 OF 03  041656Z </p><p>6. (U) CONOFFS HAD SPLIT OFF FROM THE CG AND DPO, AND WERE </p><p>FOLLOWED BY FOUR "VILLAGERS" WHO REMAINED WITH THEM FOR THE </p><p>TWO-HOUR VISIT.  ALTHOUGH THE FOUR MEN APPEARED TO BE </p><p>VILLAGERS, IT SEEMED THEY MIGHT ALSO VILLAGE SECURITY </p><p>OFFICERS.  IN RESPONSE TO CONOFFS\' QUESTIONS ABOUT </p><p>RELIGIOUS PRACTICE, THESE VILLAGERS SAID THEY WERE </p><p>PROTESTANTS.  BASED ON SUBSEQUENT INTERACTION, CONOFFS SAW </p><p>NO REASON TO DOUBT THAT.  WHEN CONOFFS ASKED TO SEE THEIR </p><p>PLACE OF WORSHIP, THEY WERE LED TO A BARN-LIKE STRUCTURE </p><p>CONTAINING 24 BENCHES, AN ALTAR WITH A SIMPLE CROSS, BIBLES </p><p>IN THE LOCAL DIALECT, AND CHRISTIAN SONGBOOKS.  THE </p><p>VILLAGERS EXPLAINED THAT 120 HOUSEHOLDS WERE PROTESTANT. </p><p>SEVEN HUNDRED WORSHIPPERS ATTENDED SERVICES EVERY SUNDAY; </p><p>14 HOUSEHOLDS WERE CATHOLIC AND TRAVELED TO A NEARBY TOWN </p><p>TO ATTEND SERVICES.  WHEN ASKED ABOUT CHRISTMAS 2001, THE </p><p>VILLAGERS SAID THERE WERE "NO PROBLEMS." </p><p> </p><p>"I\'M PRETTY SURE I MADE IT TO CAMBODIA" </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) ALSO IN DAK LAK PROVINCE, CONGENOFFS VISITED BUON </p><p>SUT M\'GRU VILLAGE, COMPRISED OF ETHNIC EDE AND VIETNAMESE </p><p>KINH.  ACCORDING TO THE VILLAGE CHIEF OF 27 YEARS, MA HONG, </p><p>NINE PEOPLE WERE TURNED BACK AT THE CAMBODIAN BORDER BY </p><p>VIETNAMESE SOLDIERS.  ONE GROUP WAS A DIVORCED WOMAN AND </p><p>HER CHILD; THE OTHER GROUP WAS A WIFE (WHOSE HUSBAND HAD </p><p>ALREADY GONE TO CAMBODIA) AND HER FIVE CHILDREN.  THE SUT </p><p>M\'GRU VILLAGE CHIEF SAID THERE HAD BEEN NO BEATINGS, NO </p><p>VIOLENCE AT THE BORDER.  HE SAID HE FELT SORRY FOR THE </p><p>RETURNEES, WHO HAD "BEEN LURED AWAY BY BAD PEOPLE."  DURING </p><p>HIS TENURE AS VILLAGE CHIEF, THE POPULATION HAD INCREASED </p><p>FROM 300 TO THE CURRENT 1001.  SUT M\'GRU HAS BEEN </p><p>ELECTRIFIED SINCE 1994.  IT HAS AN ELEMENTARY AND JUNIOR </p><p>HIGH SCHOOL WITH VIETNAMESE KINH AND EDE TEACHERS.  MA HONG </p><p>EXPECTS THE ETHNIC MINORITY LANGUAGE BILINGUAL PROGRAM TO </p><p>BEGIN NEXT YEAR.  MOST VILLAGERS FOLLOW TRADITIONAL TRIBAL </p><p>PRACTICES OF WORSHIPPING THE GODS OF WATER, GOOD HARVESTS, </p><p>ETC.  MA HONG NOTED THAT WHILE THERE WERE "JUST A FEW </p><p>PROTESTANT HOUSEHOLDS," THEY WORSHIPPED AT HOME. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) DPO SPOKE THROUGH A VILLAGE INTERPRETER WITH AN </p><p>EDE WOMAN WHO SAID SHE HAD TRIED TO GET TO THE CAMPS IN </p><p>CAMBODIA, BUT HAD GOTTEN LOST ON THE WAY.  THE CONVERSATION </p><p>- TRANSLATED FROM EDE TO VIETNAMESE AND THEN ENGLISH - TOOK </p><p>PLACE IN A COMFORTABLE, LARGE WOODEN HOUSE WHERE THE WOMAN, </p><p>WHO IS ONE OF TWELVE CHILDREN, WAS SURROUNDED BY FAMILY </p><p>MEMBERS.  THE WOMAN\'S NAME WAS A MI THOI.  SHE SAID SHE </p><p>WENT TO CAMBODIA BECAUSE A "BAD PERSON" HAD TOLD HER THAT </p><p>IF SHE COULD JUST GET ACROSS THE BORDER, SHE WOULD BE GIVEN </p><p>MONEY AND THE CHANCE TO HAVE A BEAUTIFUL LIFE IN A NEW </p><p>COUNTRY.  SHE SAID SHE CROSSED INTO CAMBODIA BUT COULD NOT </p><p>FIND THE CAMPS.  AFTER SPENDING TWO WEEKS IN THE WOODS, SHE </p><p>RETURNED TO SUT M\'GRU.  A MI THOI SAID SHE WAS ON HER OWN </p><p>THE WHOLE TIME, EXCEPT FOR HER 6-YEAR OLD SON, WHOM SHE HAD </p><p>TAKEN WITH HER.  SHE SAID SHE WAS DIVORCED AND A </p><p>PROTESTANT, BUT DID NOT INDICATE THIS WAS A FACTOR IN HER </p><p>DECISION TO LEAVE THE VILLAGE FOR CAMBODIA.  DPO LATER </p><p>LEARNED A MI THOI HAD NO EDUCATION, SINCE HER FAMILY HAD </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HO CHI  00203  02 OF 03  041657Z </p><p>BEEN TOO POOR WHEN SHE WAS YOUNGER. </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) A MI THOI REPEATED SEVERAL TIMES THAT HER FAMILY </p><p>HAD WELCOMED HER BACK AND THAT SHE WAS VERY HAPPY TO BE </p><p>WITH THEM AGAIN.  STILL, SHE APPEARED QUITE SAD.  SHE SAID </p><p>HER FAMILY AND THE WHOLE VILLAGE HAD HELPED HER SINCE HER </p><p>RETURN.  ASKED FOR SPECIFICS, SHE SAID HER FAMILY HAD GIVEN </p><p>HER A HOUSE OF HER OWN.  THE ONLY PROBLEM SHE MENTIONED WAS </p><p>RELATED TO A FEW "BAD VILLAGE OFFICIALS" WHO THOUGHT SHE </p><p>WAS RICH BECAUSE OF HER NEW HOUSE AND WERE CAUSING HER </p><p>DIFFICULTIES.  A MI THOI DID NOT SEEM AFRAID TO SPEAK UP </p><p>AND ANSWERED SEVERAL QUESTIONS AT LENGTH AND WITH EMOTION. </p><p>DPO BELIEVES THE VILLAGE INTERPRETER PROBABLY SUMMARIZED </p><p>ANSWERS RATHER THAN TRANSLATING ALL THE DETAILS, BUT </p><p>GENERALLY PROVIDED AN ACCURATE PICTURE OF A YOUNG WOMAN </p><p>LEADING A VERY DIFFICULT LIFE WHO DECIDED TO TRY FOR </p><p>SOMETHING BETTER AND FAILED. </p><p> </p><p>UNSCRUPULOUS LOCAL AUTHORITIES AND LAND CONFISCATION? </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) CG (ACCOMPANIED BY FSN POL/ECON ASSISTANT AND </p><p>VILLAGE CHIEF MA HONG) VISITED THE WIFE (WHOSE HUSBAND HAD </p><p>ALREADY GONE TO CAMBODIA) AND HER FIVE CHILDREN.  THE </p><p>HUSBAND\'S NAME IS Y-DHEC EBAN.  THE WIFE\'S NAME IS H\'DRO </p><p>ADUONG.  ACCORDING TO THE WIFE, HER HUSBAND LEFT FOR </p><p>CAMBODIA LAST AUTUMN.  THE TIMELINE IS UNCLEAR, BUT SOME </p><p>TIME LATER, THE FAMILY CAME HOME ONE NIGHT TO FIND THE </p><p>ELECTRICITY CUT OFF.  UNCERTAIN ABOUT WHAT THAT MEANT, THEY </p><p>DECIDED TO TRY TO FOLLOW THEIR FATHER TO CAMBODIA, BUT WERE </p><p>TURNED BACK AT THE BORDER.  H\'DRO ADUONG GREW MORE RETICENT </p><p>AT THIS POINT, EVEN THOUGH IT APPEARED THE VILLAGE CHIEF </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HO CHI  00203  02 OF 03  041657Z </p><p>WAS REASSURING HER IN THEIR NATIVE EDE LANGUAGE. </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU) THE FAMILY\'S ELDEST DAUGHTER HOWEVER, WHO </p><p>APPEARED TO BE ABOUT 20-YEARS OLD, WAS FIDGETING AND </p><p>CLEARLY ANGRY ABOUT SOMETHING.  SHE HAD ENGAGED IN A </p><p>RUNNING DISCUSSION WITH HER MOTHER IN ETHNIC EDE SINCE THE </p><p>CG\'S ARRIVAL.  SHE SAID HER NAME WAS A ME PHIAN.  IN </p><p>RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS, SHE CLAIMED THAT THERE HAD BEEN LAND </p><p>PROBLEMS WITH THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES OVER THE LAST 20 </p><p>MONTHS.  AFTER RUMMAGING IN A CUPBOARD, SHE PRODUCED COPIES </p><p>OF LEGAL DOCUMENTS SEEKING RETURN OF LAND THAT HER FATHER </p><p>(Y-DHEC EBAN) CLAIMED THE VILLAGE CHIEF AND CU SUE COMMUNE </p><p>PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE HAD UNLAWFULLY CONFISCATED AND SOLD FOR </p><p>THEIR OWN PROFIT.  A SEPARATE DOCUMENT WAS A LETTER OF </p><p>COMPLAINT TO THE VILLAGE POLICE, ALLEGING THAT BECAUSE OF </p><p>THE LAND DISPUTE, SIX OTHER ETHNIC MINORITY VILLAGERS HAD </p><p>COME TO BEAT Y-DHEK EBAN\'S WIFE.  THEY INJURED HER SO BADLY </p><p>THAT SHE HAD TO GO TO THE DAK LAK PROVINCIAL HOSPITAL FOR </p><p>EMERGENCY TREATMENT.  BOTH DOCUMENTS INDICATE THE </p><p>PETITIONER (Y-DHEK EBAN) HAD PRESENTED HIS CASE SEVERAL </p><p>TIMES TO THE COMMUNE COMMITTEE. </p><p> </p><p>12. (SBU) WHEN CG LATER ASKED A PROVINCIAL OFFICIAL WHETHER </p><p>SHE WAS FAMILIAR WITH THE CASE, THE OFFICIAL RESPONDED YES. </p><p>ACCORDING TO THIS OFFICIAL, THE FAMILY IS RIGHT ON CERTAIN </p><p>POINTS, BUT WRONG ON OTHERS.  THEN THE OFFICIAL VOLUNTEERED </p><p>RETURNED ON THEIR OWN AND SOME WHO NEVER MADE IT ACROSS </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HO CHI  00203  03 OF 03  041657Z </p><p>THAT THE ETHNIC MINORITY VILLAGERS OFTEN DO NOT UNDERSTAND </p><p>LAWS AND REGULATIONS - "EVEN THOSE THAT GIVE THEM GREATER </p><p>PRIVILEGES AND BENEFITS THAT THE REST OF US (VIETNAMESE </p><p>KINH) DO NOT HAVE." </p><p> </p><p>13. (SBU) RETURNING TO THE ELDEST DAUGHTER A ME PHIAN, SHE </p><p>SAID THE FAMILY HAD DEPARTED ON DECEMBER 24 FOR THE </p><p>CAMBODIAN BORDER.  SHE WAS NOT CERTAIN WHEN THEY HAD </p><p>RETURNED, BUT THE VILLAGE CHIEF RECKONED IT WAS 8-9 DAYS </p><p>AFTER THAT.  CG ASKED HOW THE FAMILY HAD BEEN TREATED SINCE </p><p>THEIR RETURN.  A ME PHIAN RESPONDED WITH A NEUTRAL SHRUG, </p><p>BUT COMPLAINED THAT SOME DRUNKEN VILLAGERS HAD TAUNTED AND </p><p>SCARED THE FAMILY LATE ONE NIGHT.  THE VILLAGE CHIEF THEN </p><p>INTERRUPTED TO SAY THAT THE POLICE RESPONDED IMMEDIATELY </p><p>AND TOOK THE ROWDIES TO THE COMMUNE STATION AND TOLD THEM </p><p>NOT TO DO IT AGAIN.  A ME PHIAN DID NOT CONTRADICT THIS. </p><p>ASKED IF THE BROKEN CLOCK WITH A THREE-DIMENSIONAL PICTURE </p><p>OF THE LAST SUPPER MEANT THE FAMILY WAS PROTESTANT OR </p><p>CATHOLIC, SHE REPLIED THEY WERE PROTESTANT.  SHE GAVE NO </p><p>INDICATION THAT SHE THOUGHT THIS HAD PLAYED A ROLE IN </p><p>EITHER THE LAND OR BORDER-CROSSING ISSUES. </p><p> </p><p>14. (SBU) COMMENT: A ME PHIAN\'S FEARLESSNESS IN PRESENTING </p><p>US THE LAND DOCUMENTS RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE VILLAGE CHIEF </p><p>(WHO MIGHT WELL HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE "CORRUPT LOCAL </p><p>OFFICIALS" REFERRED TO IN THE WRITTEN ALLEGATIONS) WAS </p><p>IMPRESSIVE.  SHE HAD RECEIVED NO SCHOOOLING, AND IN FACT, </p><p>THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF EDUCATION AMONG THE RETURNEES WE MET </p><p>WAS FOURTH GRADE.  EVEN THE VILLAGE CHIEF TOLD US THAT HIS </p><p>IDEA OF "FAR AWAY" WAS ANYTHING BEYOND 60 METERS.  DAK LAK </p><p>MARKED THE FIRST TIME WE HAD HEARD A GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HO CHI  00203  03 OF 03  041657Z </p><p>HINT OPENLY AT RESENTMENT TOWARD ETHNIC MINORITIES FOR THE </p><p>SPECIAL BENEFITS THEY ARE ENTITLED TO.  IT WAS ALSO THE </p><p>ONLY DETAILED "LAND PROBLEM" WE HEARD ABOUT ON THIS TRIP. </p><p>SEPTEL WILL FOLLOW ON THIS LAST SUBJECT.  YAMAUCHI </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
