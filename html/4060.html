<p>UNCLAS AMMAN 006189 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/PDD; IIP, R. PA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO PREL OIIP JO </p><p>SUBJECT: RAMADAN PUBLIC AFFAIRS STRATEGY 2002 </p><p> </p><p>Ref: secstate 201932 </p><p> </p><p>1.   Following is an outline of the PD Ramadan </p><p>activities which emphasize respect for Islam and shared </p><p>values during the month of Ramadan.  In Jordan, Ramadan </p><p>is a festive time similar to the Christmas season. </p><p>After the Iftar, most Jordanians spend their time on </p><p>visits to family and friends, cultural entertainment or </p><p>congregating in cafes and watching the many Ramadan TV </p><p>serials available on local and satellite TV.  Embassy </p><p>officers from all sections, starting with the </p><p>Ambassador and DCM, attend and host a wide variety of </p><p>iftars involving a wide spectrum of the community. </p><p>Following are the main Ramadan Public Affairs </p><p>activities which we plan during this period. </p><p> </p><p>2.   Press and News Media Activities </p><p> </p><p>We plan to invite 50 journalists to an iftar hosted by </p><p>Ambassador Gnehm.  In addition, we will equip all of </p><p>the Embassy officers who will be attending iftars and </p><p>other Ramadan gatherings with "speaker kits," featuring </p><p>talking points and background information on hot issues </p><p>such as Iraq and the Palestinian-Israeli conflict as </p><p>well as student visas.  We will also draw the attention </p><p>of JTV and other news media to Secretary Powell\'s Nov. </p><p>6 iftar as well as any other high-level Ramadan events </p><p>in the U.S.  Our web page will feature materials on the </p><p>above events plus other information about Muslim life </p><p>in the U.S., the "dialogue of civilizations" and </p><p>related topics. </p><p> </p><p>3.   Cultural Activities </p><p> </p><p>In addition to an Ambassadorial iftar for 50 academics, </p><p>artists, and intellectuals, particularly young people, </p><p>we will propose an iftar which either the Ambassador or </p><p>PAO could host for the legal community.  The latter </p><p>group cooperates with us closely in our judicial reform </p><p>projects and includes many religiously conservative </p><p>young professionals.  The CAO plans a Ramadan evening </p><p>with poetry readings and oud music.  We would also like </p><p>to do an Arabic-language DVC on the topic of Ramadan in </p><p>the U.S.,  perhaps about "Ramadan before and after </p><p>Sept. 11."  Finally, we would invite members of the IV </p><p>delegation from various Sharia\' Law faculties to a </p><p>Ramadan evening or Iftar in which they would discuss </p><p>their recent trip to the U.S. </p><p> </p><p>4.   Other activities. </p><p> </p><p>About a week after the Eid following Ramadan, Promo-7, </p><p>the local affiliate of Webber-Shandwick, plans to </p><p>sponsor in close coordination with post a speaker tour </p><p>featuring a Muslim-American group who will discuss </p><p>Muslim life in America and shared values between Islam </p><p>and the U.S.  The speakers will include a 28-year old </p><p>female author, the public affairs director of the </p><p>Supreme Islamic Council of America, a paramedic and an </p><p>entrepreneurial couple who appeared in the TV Public </p><p>Service Announcements about Muslim Life in the U.S. </p><p>This group will meet with young business people, </p><p>artists and intellectuals and will be interviewed on </p><p>Jordan satellite TV in advance of the PSA\'s which we </p><p>understand may be aired on local and/or satellite TV. </p><p>Post is assisting Promo 7 in its effort to obtain </p><p>permission to air the PSA\'s on JTV during Ramadan. </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
