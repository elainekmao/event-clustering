<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 TEGUCIGALPA 002556 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>WHA/CEN, DRL, AND EB </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KJUS, KDEM, PGOV, ECON, PHUM, HO </p><p>SUBJECT: TRANSPARENCY INTERNATIONAL RATES HONDURAS AMONG </p><p>THE MOST CORRUPT IN THE REGION </p><p> </p><p>REF: TEGUCIGALPA 01927 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) SUMMARY:  On August 29, Transparency International </p><p>released its 2002 Corruption Perceptions Index ranking </p><p>Honduras 71 of 102 countries analyzed.  Honduras scored 2.7 </p><p>on a scale of 1 to 10 (with 10 being a perfect score) - the </p><p>same score it received in 2001.  The CPI highlighted the fact </p><p>that Honduras is the third most corrupt country in Central </p><p>America, trailing Nicaragua and Guatemala.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>THE INDEX </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) Transparency International (TI) is the world,s </p><p>leading non-governmental organization dedicated to fighting </p><p>corruption.  It is an international organization based in </p><p>Germany, which has more than 80 independent national chapters </p><p>around the world.  First initiated in 1995, the 2002 CPI </p><p>draws on 14 different surveys that derive information from </p><p>both residents and expatriates - including business people, </p><p>academia and risk analysts.  The CPI does not measure the </p><p>prevalence of actual corruption, but rather measures the </p><p>degree to which corruption is perceived to exist among public </p><p>officials and politicians.  The index provides a snapshot of </p><p>the views decision-makers who make key decisions on </p><p>investment and trade.  The purpose of the CPI is to build </p><p>public awareness about corruption and to increase pressure on </p><p>governments to directly address the issue. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) TI defines corruption as the abuse of public office </p><p>for private gain.  TI considers a variety of factors, </p><p>including the tendency of a country to receive international </p><p>bribes, the illicit enrichment of public officials, national </p><p>codes of conduct, the capability to identify cronyism, </p><p>transparency in the government acquisition system and public </p><p>access to information. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>HONDURAS RECEIVES BAD MARK </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) On August 29, TI released its 2002 CPI that ranked </p><p>Honduras number 71 out of a total of 102 countries analyzed. </p><p>Honduras received a score of 2.7 on a scale of 1 to 10 - 10 </p><p>indicating the lowest level of corruption, or a "perfect" </p><p>score.  This is the same score Honduras received in the 2001 </p><p>CPI.  According to the CPI Honduras is the third most corrupt </p><p>country in Central America, trailing only Nicaragua and </p><p>Guatemala (both with a score of 2.5).  Costa Rica led the </p><p>Central American countries with a score of 4.5, while Chile </p><p>received the highest mark in all of Latin America with a </p><p>score of 7.5. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) German Espinal, coordinator of the technical agency </p><p>for the Honduran National Anticorruption Commission, said </p><p>that Honduras,s ranking in the CPI reflects deterioration of </p><p>the country,s democratic credibility, and signals the </p><p>challenge the government faces in trying to gain public </p><p>confidence. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>BUT IT COULD HAVE BEEN WORSE </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) President of TI Peter Eigen underscored the fact that </p><p>there have been a number of setbacks "to the credibility of </p><p>democratic rule" in Latin America in the past year. </p><p>Argentina joined Honduras, Panama, Guatemala, Nicaragua, </p><p>Venezuela, Bolivia, Ecuador, Haiti and Paraguay with a score </p><p>of 3 or less in the CPI 2002.  Peru, Colombia, Mexico, El </p><p>Salvador, Panama, Argentina, Guatemala, Venezuela and Ecuador </p><p>all received lower scores in 2002 than in 2001.  With scores </p><p>plunging in many Latin American countries, some observers </p><p>opine that Honduras,s score is not so bad. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) Reftel outlines recent anticorruption efforts in </p><p>Honduras and provides a summary of the strides that have been </p><p>made.  There is no question that corruption is still </p><p>pervasive in Honduras, but there has been some measurable </p><p>progress.  However, the positive developments that have </p><p>occurred have not been enough to adequately address the </p><p>problem, and as reflected in the CPI, the public confidence </p><p>of Hondurans has not improved. </p><p> </p><p>PIERCE </p><p></p></div>
