(SBU) Summary:  The regime\'s continued mismanagement of </p><p>the Burmese economy has given another push to its downward </p><p>slide in recent months.  The government\'s increasing reliance </p><p>on trade restrictions, rather than fiscal and monetary policy </p><p>measures, has slashed imports and halted temporarily the </p><p>plummeting of the kyat.  However, this hamfisted approach </p><p>will leave key structural issues completely unaddressed and, </p><p>in the long run, do more harm than good.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>Trade: \'Tis Better to Give than Receive </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) GOB trade figures for the first half of 2002 reflect </p><p>an improving trade balance for Burma.  According to </p><p>government statistics, exports have risen about 10.5 percent </p><p>while imports have plummeted over 35 percent.  As a result, </p><p>the government can brag of the first trade surplus in many </p><p>years.  However, the reality for the economy is much more </p><p>negative. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) The decline in imports reflects a number of factors </p><p>-- including the closure of the Thai border for several </p><p>months over the summer.  Even more significantly, however, </p><p>the government has actively discouraged imports over the past </p><p>year in hopes of conserving foreign exchange.  In recent </p><p>weeks, import requests, all of which must be cleared at the </p><p>highest levels, have been regularly denied or edited.  The </p><p>government requires that all foreign exchange spent on </p><p>imports be offset by export earnings.  Also, according to a </p><p>1998 regulation, 80 percent of an entity\'s imports must be </p><p>off a government-approved list of "essential" items -- a list </p><p>that frequently changes and often has little to do with what </p><p>is truly essential to the economy. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Exports rose during the same period largely because </p><p>of Burma\'s increasing role as an exporter of seafood and a </p><p>strong early showing for rice exports.  However, exports for </p><p>the full year may sink due to a sharp decline in exports of </p><p>garments and textiles to the United States and growing </p><p>questions over the availability of rice stocks.  Reliable </p><p>sources have told us that rice warehouse managers sold much </p><p>of their stock when prices started to rise, expecting to buy </p><p>it all back when prices fell.  Continuing high prices have </p><p>made this impossible.  As a result, exports are being pinched </p><p>during the second half of 2002.  For the government, the </p><p>choice will be between fulfilling export goals and keeping </p><p>the people fed.  As in the past, we expect the government to </p><p>choose political stability over exports. </p><p> </p><p>Inflation: Countdown to Blast Off </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Inflation, meanwhile, will worsen in upcoming months </p><p>as import controls are felt.  During the August-October </p><p>period, the overall consumer price index rose 7.4 percent </p><p>(with the CPI of imports leading the way with a nearly 10 </p><p>percent jump).  The price of key edible staples rose even </p><p>faster, with rice up 14.3 percent, beans up an average of 10 </p><p>percent, and fish paste up 12.5 percent. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Official import limitations, of course, have only a </p><p>partial impact on the supply of goods.  Despite government </p><p>efforts to crack down on illicit as well as legal imports, a </p><p>robust black market in consumer goods and other imported </p><p>materials has always managed to keep consumers and producers </p><p>well supplied.  However, as in the past, prices will increase </p><p>across the board, reflecting the risks and costs associated </p><p>with smuggling and black marketing. </p><p> </p><p>Exchange Rate:  Riding the Roller Coaster </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) The dollar rate for the kyat has gyrated wildly </p><p>during the past three months.  After hitting an all-time high </p><p>of 1310 kyat to the dollar on September 25, the kyat </p><p>appreciated nearly 24 percent to 1000 kyat/dollar by the end </p><p>of October, before again dropping to about 1075 kyat/dollar. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) There are at least three reasons for the short-term </p><p>strengthening of the kyat.  First, the military-controlled </p><p>Union of Myanmar Economic Holdings, Ltd. (UMEHL) lost its </p><p>lucrative right to import diesel and cooking oil.  Because </p><p>UMEHL, unlike other importers, was not required to pay for </p><p>its imports with export earnings, the holding company had </p><p>been a major consumer of black market dollars.  With its </p><p>operations now curtailed, the demand for foreign exchange in </p><p>the black market has fallen sharply.  Second, the authorities </p><p>cracked down on the widely popular, but illegal, gambling </p><p>networks.  The organizers of these gambling rings were large </p><p>consumers of black market dollars, daily changing their large </p><p>kyat earnings into dollars (in effect funding capital </p><p>flight).  Finally, seasonal factors have played a role, </p><p>including a demand for kyat to fund harvest purchases, and an </p><p>influx of foreign exchange as the tourist season gets </p><p>underway. </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) The kyat\'s recent strength, of course, will not </p><p>endure, if only because the currency will shortly have to </p><p>cope not only with the nearly inevitable breakdown of the </p><p>government\'s trade controls, but also with the irresistible </p><p>force of the government\'s annual budget financing, which is </p><p>felt most clearly in the months from February through April. </p><p>Each year at that time, the GOB drops several hundred billion </p><p>kyat into the market, with a predictable impact on the kyat\'s </p><p>value against all other currencies. </p><p> </p><p>Investment: Bottoming Out </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) The foreign investment situation could not be worse. </p><p>During the first half of 2002, investment was down 97 percent </p><p>from the same period a year earlier.  During the first half </p><p>of 2002 there was only a single approved investment, by a </p><p>Hong Kong textiles firm, for a mere $1.5 million.  Opaque </p><p>policymaking, corruption, government interference, and a </p><p>generally bad investment climate were the prime factors </p><p>behind the decline.  This year, as a result, seems a total </p><p>loss.  However, the numbers could get a small bump up next </p><p>year from expected investment in mining in the north, and in </p><p>the off-shore energy sector. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU) Watching the GOB manage the Burmese economy is like </p><p>watching a man trying to tie his shoes with one hand.  The </p><p>GOB has only one policy tool -- trade restrictions (coupled </p><p>with arrests) -- that it knows how to use at all, and it uses </p><p>that tool in every contingency.  Prices too high?  Restrict </p><p>trade!  Kyat depreciating?  Restrict trade (and arrest </p><p>people)!  Investment falling?  Restrict trade (and </p><p>investment)!  Never, ever, however, is there any effort to </p><p>develop some balance in the government\'s fiscal operations, </p><p>or any restraint in regard to monetary policy.  Given that </p><p>approach, there is really little one can expect except </p><p>increasing financial imbalances, soaring prices, and </p><p>eventually collapsing production.  Sad to say, but that is </p><p>the future of the Burmese economy.  End comment. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
