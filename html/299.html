BEGIN TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>SENDERO LUMINOSO (SHINING PATH) </p><p></p><p>DANGEROUS AND UNPREDICTABLE </p><p></p><p>PERU\'S SENDERO LUMINOSO (SHINING PATH) IS AN EXTREMELY </p><p>DANGEROUS AND UNPREDICTABLE TERRORIST AND INSURGENCY </p><p>GROUP.  ITS DECLARED AIM IS TO DESTROY EXISTING PERUVIAN </p><p>INSTITUTIONS AND REPLACE THEM WITH AN INDIAN-BASED </p><p>PEASANT REVOLUTIONARY REGIME, INSPIRED IN PART BY MAO </p><p>ZEDONG\'S CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN CHINA. </p><p></p><p>SENDERO INTIMIDATES THE POPULACE BY EXECUTING -- </p><p>FREQUENTLY IN GRUESOME WAYS -- CIVILIANS WHO HAVE </p><p>GOVERNMENT TIES, AND OTHERS IT CONSIDERS IDEOLOGICAL </p><p>ENEMIES.  IT AGGRESSIVELY CONDUCTS POLITICAL </p><p>INDOCTRINATIONS IN AREAS IT CONTROLS AND, SINCE 1987. </p><p>HAS DEVELOPED TIES TO NARCOTIC TRAFFICKERS AND TO THE </p><p>PEASANT COCA-GROWERS WHOM IT SEEKS TO PROTECT.  ALTHOUGH </p><p>INITIALLY OPERATING AS A GUERRILLA FORCE IN THE RURAL </p><p>AREAS, SENDERO HAS ADDED URBAN TERRORISM AS A COMPLEMENT </p><p>TO ITS RURAL "PEOPLE\'S WAR" INSURGENCY. </p><p></p><p>ESTIMATES OF TOTAL NUMBERS OF PEOPLE KILLED SINCE MAY </p><p>1980 -- WHEN SENDERO BEGAN ITS VIOLENT CAMPAIGN -- REACH </p><p>ALMOST 15,000, WITH NEARLY 2,000 KILLED LAST YEAR. </p><p></p><p>BACKGROUND </p><p></p><p>SENDERO BEGAN AS A MOVEMENT IN THE LATE 1960S AT THE </p><p>NATIONAL UNIVERSITY AT SAN CRISTOBAL OF HUAMANGA IN </p><p>AYACUCHO, A COLONIAL-ERA PROVINCIAL CAPITAL HIGH IN THE </p><p>ANDES, 230 MILES SOUTHEAST OF LIMA.  ABIMAEL GUZMAN </p><p>REYNOSO, ITS FOUNDER WHO IS CALLED, "PRESIDENT GONZALO, </p><p>END QUOTE BY HIS FOLLOWERS, WAS A PHILOSOPHY PROFESSOR </p><p>AT THE UNIVERSITY AND A LEADER OF THE PRO-CHINESE </p><p>FACTION WITHIN PERU\'S COMMUNIST PARTY.  IN 1970, HE AND </p><p>HIS FACTION TOOK THE NAME , "SHINING PATH OF JOSE CARLOS </p><p>MARIATEGUI, END QUOTE  THE FOUNDER OF THE COMMUNIST </p><p>PARTY IN PERU IN THE 1920S.  SENDERO WENT UNDERGOUND IN </p><p>1978 AND, TWO YEARS LATER, LAUNCHED ITS FIRST VIOLENT </p><p>ATTACK -- ON A RURAL POLLING STATION ON MAY 17, 1980, </p><p>BURNING ALL THE BALLOT BOXES.  SENDERO\'S ANTI-DEMOCRATIC </p><p>NATURE WAS PARTICULARLY APPARENT IN THIS FIRST ATTACK </p><p>SINCE THE 1980 ELECTION MARKED THE RETURN TO CIVILIAN </p><p>RULE IN PERU AFTER TWELVE YEARS OF MILITARY DICTATORSHIP. </p><p></p><p>ESTIMATES OF THE NUMBER OF SENDERO MILITANTS RANGE UP </p><p>TO 5,000, WITH MANY MORE SUPPORTERS.  ALTHOUGH SENDERO </p><p>FOCUSES ITS APPEAL ON THE DISADVANTAGED ETHNIC-INDIAN </p><p>SEGMENT OF PERU\'S POPULATION, IT HAS SUCCESSFULLY </p><p>RECRUITED AMONG THE SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF THE MIDDLE AND </p><p>UPPER CLASSES AS WELL.  IT ALSO SEEKS TO RECRUIT 13-15 </p><p>YEAR-OLDS AS ARMED MILITANTS SINCE THEY CAN BE MORE </p><p>EASILY PROPAGANDIZED INTO SUPPORTING WITH UNMITIGATING </p><p>VIOLENCE SENDERO\'S CAUSE. </p><p></p><p>IDEOLOGY </p><p></p><p>LOOKING TO MAO ZEDONG FOR INSPIRATION, SENDERO </p><p>CONSIDERS ITS PHILOSOPHY AS THE FULLEST DEVELOPMENT OF </p><p>"SCIENTIFIC COMMUNIST THOUGHT, END QUOTE AND SEEKS TO </p><p>ESTABLISH THROUGH VIOLENT REVOLUTION A "PEOPLE\'S </p><p>REPUBLIC OF NEW DEMOCRACY END QUOTE IN PERU.  IT DEEPLY </p><p>DISTRUSTS SOVIET AND CUBAN "REVISIONISM, END QUOTE AND </p><p>HAS DUBBED THE SOVIETS SOCIAL IMPERIALISTS." </p><p></p><p>SENDERO ALSO DISTRUSTS NICARAGUA, NORTH KOREA AND </p><p>VIRTUALLY ALL OTHER COMMUNIST REGIMES.  IT DENOUNCES </p><p>DENG XIAOPING\'S "REVISIONISM END QUOTE IN CHINA, VIEWING </p><p>INSTEAD THE DEPOSED "GANG OF FOUR" AS HEROES OF THE </p><p>CULTURAL REVOLUTION.  SENDERO LEADER GUZMAN, ACCORDING </p><p>TO DOCUMENTS FROM THE GROUP\'S FOURTH PLENUM OF THE </p><p>CENTRAL COMMITTEE, ALSO LABELLED LIBYA\'S MU\'AMMAR </p><p>QADHAFI "A FAKE." </p><p></p><p>SENDERO\'S GOAL IS TO DESTROY NOT ONLY THE GOVERNMENT, </p><p>BUT ALSO THE SOCIAL ORDER.  IT CLAIMS TO CHAMPION THE </p><p>DISADVANTAGED INDIAN PEASANTS, BUT SHOWS NO REMORSE IN </p><p>KILLING THOSE WHO, IN ITS VIEW, DISPLAY A "PETIT RURAL </p><p>BOURGEOISIE END QUOTE MENTALITY.  SENDERO ALSO </p><p>IMPLEMENTS A STRICT MORAL CODE -- INCLUDING NO SMOKING </p><p>OR DRINKING -- AND DESPITE AIDING NARCOTIC TRAFFICKERS </p><p>AND COCA-GROWERS, IT IS KNOWN TO HAVE EXECUTED THOSE </p><p>UNDER ITS CONTROL FOUND USING DRUGS THEMSELVES. </p><p></p><p>STRATEGY AND TACTICS </p><p></p><p>SENDERO HAS ATTEMPTED TO TERRORIZE THE POPULATION </p><p>THROUGH VIOLENCE, AND HAS MURDERED GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, </p><p>PARLIAMENTARIANS, JUDGES, POLITICAL ACTIVISTS, </p><p>JOURNALISTS, DEVELOPMENT WORKERS (BOTH FOREIGN AND </p><p>NATIVE), PROFESSORS, TEACHERS, PEASANTS, AND </p><p>OCCASIONALLY TOURISTS.  IN 1988 ALONE, IT KILLED 17 </p><p>PROVINCIAL MAYORS.  IT HAS ATTACKED GOVERNMENT BUILDINGS </p><p>AND FOREIGN EMBASSIES.  FOLLOWING THE SHOOTING OF TWO </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY DEPUTIES IN MAY OF THIS YEAR (ONE ATTACK </p><p>APPARENTLY CRIMINALLY MOTIVATED), OVER 20 PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>DEPUTIES FROM TWO DIFFERENT POLITICAL PARTIES PUBLICLY </p><p>ANNOUNCED THAT THEY HAD RECEIVED DEATH THREATS OR </p><p>ATTEMPTS ON THEIR LIVES, INDICATING THE EXTENT TO WHICH </p><p>PUBLIC OFFICIALS HAVE BEEN THREATENED BY THE TERRORIST </p><p>VIOLENCE. </p><p></p><p>RURAL AND URBAN </p><p> </p><p>SIMILAR TO MAO\'S DOCTRINE OF ENCIRCLING </p><p>THE CITIES FROM THE COUNTRYSIDE, SENDERO SEES THE RURAL </p><p>AREAS AS THE PRINCIPAL THEATER FOR ITS ARMED ATTACKS. </p><p>URBAN SUBVERSION AND TERRORISM, HOWEVER, HAVE BECOME </p><p>INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT TO ITS STRATEGY.  IN A JULY 1988 </p><p>INTERVIEW (THE FIRST THE SECRETIVE SENDERO LEADER HAD </p><p>GIVEN SINCE 1979), GUZMAN STATED THAT SENDERO MUST BE </p><p>PREPARED FOR WHAT HE CHARACTERIZED AS THE FINAL ASSAULT </p><p>-- THE TAKING OF THE CITIES.  OTHER DOCUMENTS FROM EARLY </p><p>1988 ALSO INDICATE THAT SENDERO WAS STRESSING URBAN </p><p>SUBVERSION AND TERRORISM AS A COMPLEMENT TO ITS RURAL </p><p>WARFARE. </p><p></p><p>THIS NEW URBAN EMPHASIS, HOWEVER, WAS DEALT A SEVERE, </p><p>BUT NOT CRIPPLING, BLOW WHEN OSMAN MOROTE BARRIONUEVO, </p><p>BELIEVED TO BE SENDERO\'S SECOND-IN-COMMAND, WAS ARRESTED </p><p>IN LIMA AND CONVICTED LATER IN 1988.  OTHER RECENT </p><p>SETBACKS WERE THE EARLY AUGUST ARRESTS IN LIMA OF 29 </p><p>SENDERO MEMBERS WHICH, ACCORDING TO THE PERUVIAN </p><p>INTERIOR MINISTER, DISMANTLED A MAJOR SUBVERSIVE </p><p>NETWORK, AND THE ARREST LATER IN THE MONTH OF SAMUEL </p><p>VIDAL ESPINOZA, A SENDERO LEADER WHO WAS CHARGED WITH </p><p>SEVERAL CRIMES INCLUDING THE MURDER OF RODRIGO FRANCO, A </p><p>HIGH RANKING GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL. </p><p></p><p>IN ADDITION TO TERRORISM, SENDERO\'S URBAN STRATEGY </p><p>INCLUDES SEEKING TO INFILTRATE TRADE UNIONS, STUDENT </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS AND LEFTIST POLITICAL PARTIES.  IT HAS </p><p>ALSO BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR ARMED STRIKES IN SEVERAL RURAL </p><p>AREAS IN 1989 AND A ONE-DAY GENERAL STRIKE IN JULY WHICH </p><p>PARALYZED TRANSPORTATION IN MUCH OF LIMA. </p><p></p><p>ECONOMIC SABOTAGE </p><p> </p><p>SENDERO ALSO PURSUES A CAMPAIGN OF ECONOMIC SABOTAGE </p><p>AND IN 1988 ALONE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTIMATES OF </p><p>LOSSES AS HIGH AS $2.65 BILLION.  IT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR </p><p>NUMEROUS BLACKOUT AND BROWNOUTS IN LIMA AND OTHER AREAS </p><p>OF PERU THROUGH ITS SYSTEMATIC BOMBING OF ELECTRIC </p><p>PYLONS.  THIS CAMPAIGN CULMINATED WHEN SENDERO BLACKED </p><p>OUT LIMA AS WELL AS MANY INTERIOR DEPARTMENTS FOR A </p><p>TOTAL OF 21 DAYS DURING THE MONTH OF AUGUST. </p><p></p><p>SENDERO HAS ATTACKED RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS, </p><p>KILLING GOVERNMENT ENGINEERS WHO WERE WORKING TO UPGRADE </p><p>RURAL FACILITIES.  EXAMPLES INCLUDED THE DECEMBER 1987 </p><p>ATTACK ON THE OFFICE OF THE GOVERNMENT IRRIGATION </p><p>PROJECT IN AYACUCHO, IN WHICH IT KILLED THREE ENGINEERS, </p><p>INCLUDING THE HEAD OF THE CACHI RIVER IRRIGATION </p><p>PROJECT.  THE PROJECT, WHICH SENDERO HAD VOWED TO BLOCK, </p><p>WOULD IRRIGATE 34,000 ACRES OF FARMLAND AND PROVIDE </p><p>25,000 KILOWATTS OF ELECTRICITY TO THE REGION.  IN JUNE </p><p>1988, SENDERO EXECUTED AN AMERICAN USAID CONTRACT </p><p>EMPLOYEE AND A PERUVIAN COLLEAGUE NEAR QUICHA BAJA WHO </p><p>WERE WORKING ON A LOCAL AGRICULTURAL PROJECT.  IN </p><p>DECEMBER 1988, IT KILLED TWO FRENCH AND TWO PERUVIAN </p><p>ENGINEERS WORKING ON A RURAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT IN THE </p><p>SOUTH CENTRAL DEPARTMENT OF APURIMAC, AND ALSO THAT </p><p>MONTH, ATTACKED A DEVELOPMENT PROJECT RUN BY THE </p><p>EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY.  THE EEC RECALLED ITS AID </p><p>EMPLOYEES BECAUSE OF THAT ATTACK, AND IN JANUARY OF THIS </p><p>YEAR, THE DUTCH GOVERNMENT WITHDREW ITS DEVELOPMENT </p><p>WORKERS FROM THE COUNTRYSIDE BECAUSE OF THE THREAT OF </p><p>SENDERO ATTACKS. </p><p></p><p>ALTHOUGH THESE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS WOULD AID THE </p><p>RURAL POPULATIONS WHOSE INTERESTS SENDERO CLAIMS TO </p><p>DEFEND, SENDERO ATTACKS THEM IN ORDER TO UNDERMINE THE </p><p>ESTABLISHED GOVERNMENT AND TO PRESENT TO THE PEASANTRY </p><p>NO HOPE FOR IMPROVEMENT UNTIL SENDERO AUTHORITY IS </p><p>ESTABLISHED.  IN THE WORDS OF GUZMAN QUOTED AT SENDERO\'S </p><p>FOURTH PLENUM OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE, "OUR POLICY IS </p><p>TO RAZE TO THE GROUND, TO LEAVE NOTHING...IN A WAR, WHAT </p><p>YOU CAN\'T USE OR CARRY OFF, YOU DESTROY, YOU BURN." </p><p></p><p>ANTI-ELECTION CAMPAIGN </p><p></p><p>SENDERO APPEARS TO HAVE LAUNCHED A CAMPAIGN AGAINST </p><p>THE UPCOMING MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS IN NOVEMBER AND THE </p><p>GENERAL ELECTIONS IN APRIL 1990.  DURING THE SUMMER </p><p>MONTHS, SENDERO TERRORISTS SELECTIVELY ASSASSINATED OVER </p><p>A SCORE OF POLITICAL LEADERS TO INCLUDE LOCAL MAYORS, </p><p>PARTY REPRESENTATIVES AND CANDIDATES.  THROUGH LETHAL </p><p>INTIMIDATION, SENDERO POSES A POTENTIAL THREAT TO PERU\'S </p><p>DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM AS THE CONSTITUTION CALLS FOR A </p><p>CANCELLATION OF THE VOTE COUNT IF 30 PERCENT OF THE </p><p>ELECTORATE ARE PREVENTED FROM CASTING THEIR BALLOTS. </p><p></p><p>THE COCA CONNECTION </p><p></p><p>SENDERO GUERRILLAS HAVE BECOME INCREASINGLY ACTIVE IN </p><p>UPPER HUALLAGA VALLEY, THE LOCALE OF MOST OF PERU\'S </p><p>ILLEGAL COCA PRODUCTION, AND HAVE BECOME A THREAT TO THE </p><p>PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT\'S U.S.-ASSISTED DRUG ERADICATION, </p><p>CROP SUBSTITUTION, AND INTERDICTION EFFORTS.  ATTACKS BY </p><p>BOTH TRAFFICKERS AND SENDERO GUERRILLAS HAVE INCREASED </p><p>SUBSTANTIALLY IN 1989, FORCING THE SUSPENSION OF SOME OF </p><p>THESE OPERATIONS FOR SIX MONTHS. </p><p></p><p>SENDERO REPORTEDLY ACTS AS AN INTERMEDIARY BETWEEN THE </p><p>PEASANT GROWERS AND THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS, WINNING HIGHER </p><p>PRICES FOR THE GROWERS, TAKING A CUT OF THE PROFITS, AND </p><p>PROVIDING PROTECTION.  IN A POLICE RAID ON A SUSPECTED </p><p>DRUG TARGET IN THE TOWN OF UCHIZA IN FEBRUARY OF THIS </p><p>YEAR, 45 KILOS OF COCAINE PASTE WERE SEIZED AND EIGHT </p><p>SUSPECTS ARRESTED.  TWO WERE SENDERO MEMBERS. </p><p></p><p>SENDERO\'S INVOLVEMENT IN DRUGS BECAME INCREASINGLY </p><p>APPARENT SINCE 1987 WHEN, IN JUNE OF THAT YEAR, THE </p><p>DIRECTOR OF BRAZIL\'S NARCOTICS DIVISION STATED PUBLICLY </p><p>THAT SENDERO WAS INVOLVED WITH THE TRAFFICKERS OPERATING </p><p>ON THE BRAZILIAN BORDER AND RECEIVED LARGE AMOUNTS OF </p><p>MONEY FROM THEM. </p><p></p><p>SENDERO, WHICH NOW DOMINATES DOZENS OF VILLAGES IN THE </p><p>REGION AND IS INFLUENTIAL IN SEVERAL LARGER TOWNS, HAS </p><p>PUBLICLY STATED THAT THE GOVERNMENT\'S ANTI-NARCOTICS </p><p>OPERATIONS ARE A COVER FOR "IMPERIALIST EXPANSION" -- A </p><p>CONVENIENT IDEOLOGICAL RATIONALE FOR ATTACKING THEM. </p><p>SENDERO IS ORGANIZING COCA GROWERS TO PROTEST THE </p><p>ANTI-DRUG OPERATIONS, AND A PRO-SENDERO NEWSWEEKLY HAS </p><p>CONTRIBUTED TO SENDERO\'S DISINFORMATION CAMPAIGN BY </p><p>REPORTING THAT CROP ERADICATION HERBICIDES WERE </p><p>POISONING CHILDREN, SEVERAL OF WHOM, THE NEWSWEEKLY </p><p>CLAIMED, HAVE ALREADY DIED.  THE POISONING CLAIMS ARE </p><p>UNTRUE AND EXCEPT FOR A ONE-TIME APPLICATION TEST, </p><p>HERBICIDES HAVE NOT BEEN USED IN THE CROP ERADICATION </p><p>EFFORTS. </p><p></p><p>           PARTIAL INCIDENT CHRONOLOGY </p><p></p><p>1989 </p><p></p><p>SEPTEMBER </p><p></p><p>SENDERO IS SUSPECTED IN THE SHOOTING DEATH OF </p><p>DARIO FERMIN AZPARRENT, THE MAYOR OF JUMANGA IN THE </p><p>AYACUCHO DEPARTMENT.
