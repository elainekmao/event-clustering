<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 05 ZAGREB 000350 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>VIENNA ALSO FOR BOSNIA </p><p> </p><p>USVIENNA FOR USDEL OSCE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS: War Crimes </p><p>SUBJECT:  GOC DRAFT "POLITICAL SOLUTION FOR A PEACEFUL AND </p><p>          DEMOCRATIC REINTEGRATION" OF THE UNPAS </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) ZAGREB 320; (B) ZAGREB 298 (NOTAL) </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  DURING A JANUARY 24 CONVERSATION WITH THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>(REF A), FOREIGN MINISTER GRANIC HANDED OVER A GOC DRAFT </p><p>PROPOSAL (IN ENGLISH) OF "THE JURIDICAL AND POLITICAL </p><p>SOLUTION FOR A PEACEFUL AND DEMOCRATIC REINTEGRATION OF </p><p>THE TEMPORARILY OCCUPIED PARTS OF THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA </p><p>(UNPAS) INTO THE CROATIAN CONSTITUTIONAL AND JURIDICAL </p><p>SYSTEM" (FULL TEXT OF PROPOSAL IN PARA 6).  GRANIC </p><p>EXPLAINED THAT THIS WAS THE PAPER PROMISED BY PRESIDENT </p><p>TUDJMAN IN HIS MEETING WITH DOD U/S SLOCOMBE (REF B).  THE </p><p>GOC PROPOSAL, DRAFTED AS A COUNTERPOINT TO THE Z-4 PLAN, </p><p>REPRESENTS THE STRICT CONSTITUTIONALIST LINE STRONGLY </p><p>PREFERRED BY THE PRESIDENT.  THIS POSITION, SIMPLY PUT, IS </p><p>THAT "NO POLITICAL SOLUTION SHOULD OFFER THE KRAJINA SERBS </p><p>MORE THAN IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE UNDER THE CROATIAN </p><p>CONSTITUTION AND LAWS IN COMBINATION WITH PRESIDENT </p><p>TUDJMAN\'S NOVEMBER 1993 PEACE INTIATIVE." </p><p>- </p><p>3.  THIS NEWEST PROPOSAL IS THEREFORE BASICALLY A RE- </p><p>WORKED VERSION OF PREVIOUS STATEMENTS, ADOPTING SOME OF </p><p>THE LANGUAGE FROM THE Z-4 PLAN, PARTICULARLY ON HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS GUARANTEES, WITH LANGUAGE AND CULTURAL RIGHTS </p><p>GUARANTEED.  BUT THE PROPOSAL STRICTLY AVOIDS ANY </p><p>MEANINGFUL POWER-SHARING ARRANGEMENTS WHICH WOULD PERMIT </p><p>SIGNIFICANT AUTONOMY FOR THE SERB-MAJORITY AREAS. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00350  01 OF 05  251832Z </p><p> </p><p>4.  INSTEAD, THE GOC PROPOSAL WOULD FORM A NEW COUNTY </p><p>(ZUPANIJA) FROM THE DISTRICTS AROUND GLINA (SECTOR NORTH) </p><p>AND KNIN (SECTOR SOUTH).  THIS ZUPANIJA WOULD BE ENTITLED </p><p>TO THE SAME POWERS OF ANY OTHER CROATIAN ZUPANIJA UNDER </p><p>THE CURRENT LAW ON LOCAL SELF-GOVERNMENT, WHICH UNDER </p><p>CROATIA\'S HEAVILY CENTRALIZED FORM OF GOVERNMENT MEANS </p><p>ESSENTIALLY ONLY ADMINISTRATIVE POWERS OF A VERY LOCAL </p><p>NATURE.  THE COUNTY PREFECT  (ZUPAN) WOULD BE, AS IN OTHER </p><p>CROATIAN ZUPANIJA, APPOINTED BY PRESIDENT TUDJMAN.  THE </p><p>GOC PROPOSAL WOULD THEN GRANT LIMITED ADDITIONAL POWERS TO </p><p>THE NEW ZUPANIJA (LISTED IN SECTION II.7 OF THE TEXT </p><p>BELOW) SUCH AS LAND USE PLANNING; COORDINATION OF </p><p>EDUCATIONAL, HEALTH, WELFARE AND INFRASTRUCTURAL NETWORKS; </p><p>AND "COORDINATION OF ALL MATTERS...ESSENTIAL FOR THE </p><p>REALIZATION OF THE NATIONAL RIGHTS AND CULTURAL AUTONOMY </p><p>OF THE SERBIAN ETHNIC COMMUNITY OR MINORITY." </p><p> </p><p>5.  COMMENT:  THE GOC SEES ITSELF NEGOTIATING FROM A </p><p>POSITION OF STRENGTH.  NONETHELESS, WE BELIEVE TUDJMAN IS </p><p>WILLING TO OFFER SUBSTANTIAL AUTONOMY TO THE SERBS IN </p><p>EXCHANGE FOR CROATIAN SOVEREIGNTY OVER ALL ITS TERRITORY. </p><p>THIS PROPOSAL MAY BE MERELY A HARD LINE OPENING GAMBIT AND </p><p>DOUBTLESS REFLECTS ACUTE GOC CONCERN OVER THE CONTENT OF </p><p>THE Z-4 PLAN.  IF THE GOC CONSENTED TO NEGOTIATE WITH THE </p><p>KRAJINA SERBS, ON THE BASIS OF THE Z-4 PLAN OR ON ANY </p><p>OTHER BASIS, THEY WOULD MOST CERTAINLY PUSH TO HAVE ANY </p><p>EVENTUAL SETTLEMENT LOOK AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE LIKE THIS </p><p>NEWEST PAPER.  FOR THEIR PART, THE KRAJINA SERBS, WHO FIND </p><p>(WHAT THEY KNOW OF) THE Z-4 PLAN TO BE A NON-STARTER, WILL </p><p>ONLY BE FURTHER ALIENATED BY THIS CROATIAN POSITION.  END </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00350  01 OF 05  251832Z </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>6.
