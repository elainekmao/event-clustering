CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  DURING A FEBRUARY 20 MEETING ON ANOTHER SUBJECT, </p><p>THE AMBASSADOR TOOK UP WITH FIRST DEPUTY FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER BESSMERTNYKH ALLEGATIONS REPORTEDLY MADE BY </p><p>SOVIET AMBASSADOR IN KABUL BORIS PASTUKHOV THAT THE </p><p>U.S. AND PAKISTAN WERE ASSISTING MUJAHEDIN GROUPS IN </p><p>FOMENTING REBELLION IN SOVIET CENTRAL ASIA.  PASSING </p><p>BESSMERTNYKH AN AP ACCOUNT OF PASTUKHOV\'S SUNDAY, </p><p>FEBRUARY 18 PRESS CONFERENCE (REF), THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>NOTED THAT PASTUKHOV HAD REPORTEDLY ACCUSED "THE </p><p>UNITED STATES AND PAKISTAN OF USING MOSLEM </p><p>FUNDAMENTALISTS TO FUNNEL MILITARY AID TO STRIFE-TORN </p><p>SOUTHERN SOVIET REPUBLICS"..."AND HAD CREATED AN </p><p>ORGANIZATION SPECIFICALLY TO FUEL THIS UNREST" (THE </p><p>UNION OF NORTHERN PEOPLE OF AFGHANISTAN). </p><p> </p><p>3.  THE AMBASSADOR ASKED BESSMERTNYKH TO CLARIFY </p><p>WHETHER PASTUKHOV HAD ACTUALLY SAID THIS.  THIS WAS A </p><p>VERY SERIOUS CHARGE, AND AS BESSMERTNYKH KNEW THERE </p><p>WAS NO BASIS FOR ACCUSATIONS OF THIS SORT AGAINST THE </p><p>U.S., AND WE HAD NO INTEREST IN ENGAGING IN THIS SORT </p><p>OF ACTIVITY. </p><p> </p><p>4.  BESSMERTNYKH SAID HE WAS NOT AWARE OF THE REPORT </p><p>IN QUESTION AND COULD NOT COMMENT IMMEDIATELY ON ITS </p><p>ACCURACY; HE WOULD LOOK INTO IT.  HOWEVER, SPEAKING </p><p>PRELIMINARILY, HE COULD SAY THAT THERE WERE CERTAIN </p><p>FACTS OF WHICH BOTH THE U.S. AND USSR HAD TO BE </p><p>AWARE.  FIRST, MUJAHEDIN WERE INVOLVED IN </p><p>CROSS-BORDER ACTIVITY -- THIS WAS IRREFUTABLE. </p><p>SECOND, CERTAIN ELEMENTS OF THE GOVERNMENT OF </p><p>PAKISTAN (I.E., ISI) WERE ENCOURAGING MUJAHEDIN </p><p>ACTIVITY AGAINST SOVIET CENTRAL ASIA.  BESSMERTNYKH </p><p>DID NOT BELIEVE THAT THIS ACCORDED WITH THE POLICY OF </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN, BUT NEVERTHELESS IT WAS A </p><p>FACT THAT ENCOURAGEMENT WAS BEING PROVIDED. </p><p>BESSMERTNYKH ADDED THAT WHILE HE TOOK NOTE OF THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR\'S STATEMENT THAT ACCUSATIONS OF THIS SORT </p><p>AGAINST THE U.S. WERE GROUNDLESS, HE ALSO HOPED THE </p><p>U.S. WOULD TRY TO RESTRAIN THOSE FORCES IN THE </p><p>PAKISTANI GOVERNMENT THAT WERE BEHIND THIS ACTIVITY. </p><p> </p><p>MATLOCK </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p></p></div>
