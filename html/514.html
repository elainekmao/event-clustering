CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p>- </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  ON APRIL 24, BURMA\'S RULING MILITARY </p><p>COUNCIL ISSUED ITS MOST DRAMATIC POLITICAL STATEMENT </p><p>IN MORE THAN A YEAR.  IT PLEDGED TO RELEASE AN </p><p>UNSPECIFIED NUMBER OF POLITICAL DETAINEES "PROMPTLY", </p><p>TO OPEN A DIALOGUE WITH OPPOSITION POLITICIANS WITHIN </p><p>TWO MONTHS, AND TO CONVENE A "NATIONAL CONVENTION" SIX </p><p>MONTHS LATER.  THE ANNOUNCEMENT BREAKS SIGNIFICANT NEW </p><p>GROUND BY ACKNOWLEDGING THE EXISTENCE OF POLITICAL </p><p>PRISONERS AND BY SETTING TIME FRAMES FOR INITIAL MOVES </p><p>TOWARD CONSTITUTIONAL RULE.  COMING ONE DAY AFTER </p><p>GENERAL THAN SHWE REPLACED SAW MAUNG AS HEAD OF STATE, </p><p>IT REINFORCES EARLIER SPECULATION THAT THE FORMER </p><p>LEADER MAY HAVE BEEN THE PRINCIPAL ROADBLOCK TO </p><p>ADOPTION OF A MORE PRAGMATIC APPROACH ON POLITICAL AND </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES. </p><p> </p><p>3.  NEVERTHELESS, THE MILITARY RETAINS TIGHT CONTROL </p><p>AND IS STILL FOLLOWING THE BASIC SCENARIO OUTLINED IN </p><p>ITS DECLARATION 1/90, A COMPLEX MULTI-STAGED PROCESS </p><p>UNLIKELY TO PRODUCE A CIVILIAN GOVERNMENT BEFORE 1994 </p><p>AT THE EARLIEST.  AS THE PLEDGE TO RELEASE POLITICAL </p><p>DETAINEES CONTAINS A GAPING LOOPHOLE -- THE EXCLUSION </p><p>OF THOSE WHO "ENDANGER STATE SECURITY" -- IT IS ALSO </p><p>UNCLEAR WHETHER AUNG SAN SUU KYI OR ANY OTHER MAJOR </p><p>OPPOSITION FIGURES WILL BE FREED.  STILL, IT IS A </p><p>LONG-AWAITED STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND HAS BEEN </p><p>GENERALLY WELL RECEIVED BY BURMESE OF ALL STRIPES.  WE </p><p>THUS RECOMMEND THAT THE DEPARTMENT CONSIDER ISSUING A </p><p>CAREFULLY NUANCED STATEMENT CHARACTERIZING THE BURMESE </p><p>ANNOUNCEMENT AS A POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT AND STRESSING </p><p>THAT WE WILL BE WATCHING ITS IMPLEMENTATION AND </p><p>BROADENING WITH KEEN INTEREST.  (SEE PARA 11.)  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p>- </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p>UNEXPECTED ANNOUNCEMENT REVIVES BURMESE POLITICAL HOPES </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  ON APRIL 24, ONE DAY AFTER GENERAL THAN SHWE </p><p>REPLACED SAW MAUNG AS CHIEF OF STATE (REF A), BURMA\'S </p><p>RULING STATE LAW AND ORDER RESTORATION COUNCIL (SLORC) </p><p>MADE A SURPRISE ANNOUNCEMENT.  IT PLEDGED: </p><p> </p><p>-- TO RELEASE AN UNSPECIFIED NUMBER OF POLITICAL </p><p>DETAINEES "PROMPTLY"; </p><p> </p><p>-- TO OPEN A DIALOGUE WITH ELECTED PARLIAMENTARIANS </p><p>AND THE REMAINING POLITICAL PARTIES WITHIN TWO MONTHS; </p><p>AND </p><p> </p><p>-- TO CONVENE A "NATIONAL CONVENTION" SIX MONTHS </p><p>LATER. </p><p> </p><p>THE ANNOUNCEMENT, SIGNED BY INTELLIGENCE CHIEF AND </p><p>SLORC SECRETARY-1 KHIN NYUNT, HAD THE INSTANT EFFECT </p><p>OF REVIVING POLITICAL HOPES AMONG THE BURMESE POPULACE </p><p>AND RAISING EXPECTATIONS THAT MOVEMENT TOWARD A </p><p>CIVILIAN GOVERNMENT IS FINALLY IN THE REALM OF THE </p><p>POSSIBLE. </p><p> </p><p>5.  OUR OWN INITIAL ASSESSMENT AND THAT OF SEVERAL </p><p>SOLID BURMESE SOURCES IS THAT THIS REPRESENTS A </p><p>SIGNIFICANT BREAK WITH THE PAST.  THE MOST STRIKING </p><p>ASPECT OF THE OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENT IS ITS </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT THAT BURMA HAS DETAINED PEOPLE FOR </p><p>POLITICAL REASONS, A 180-DEGREE REVERSAL FROM PREVIOUS </p><p>ASSERTIONS THAT ALL DETAINEES HAD "VIOLATED EXISTING </p><p>LAW."  HOWEVER, HOW THE GOB WILL IMPLEMENT ITS </p><p>COMMITMENT TO RELEASE THESE PEOPLE REMAINS AN OPEN </p><p>QUESTION:  THE ANNOUNCEMENT CONTAINS A LOOPHOLE IN </p><p>EXCLUDING THOSE WHO "ENDANGER STATE SECURITY" AND DOES </p><p>NOT MAKE IT CLEAR WHETHER THE RELEASES WILL INCLUDE </p><p>PERSONS ALREADY CONVICTED OF "CRIMINAL" OFFENSES -- AS </p><p>OPPOSED TO THOSE MERELY "ARRESTED AND DETAINED" FOR </p><p>POLITICAL REASONS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  IN AN OPTIMISTIC VEIN, ONE FORMER POLITICIAN </p><p>SPECULATED TO US THAT THE "SECURITY" EXCLUSION IS </p><p>LARGELY A FACE-SAVING PHRASE AND THAT UP TO 90 PERCENT </p><p>OF POLITICAL PRISONERS COULD BE ON THE STREETS </p><p>SHORTLY.  HOWEVER, A MUCH MORE CAUTIOUS ASSESSMENT WAS </p><p>PROVIDED BY TWO SEASONED BURMESE JOURNALISTS (PROTECT) </p><p>WHO DO NOT EXPECT THE IMMINENT RELEASE OF AUNG SAN SUU </p><p>KYI OR ANY OTHER ACTIVE OPPOSITION FIGURES LIKE NLD </p><p>LEADERS KYI MAUNG AND FORMER GENERAL TIN 00.  MOST </p><p>SOURCES AGREE THAT THE AUTHORITIES WILL PROBABLY LIFT </p><p>THE HOUSE ARREST OF U NU, SINCE THE ELDERLY AND </p><p>ENFEEBLED FORMER PRIME MINISTER HAS NOT BEEN CONVICTED </p><p>OF ANY CRIME AND HARDLY REPRESENTS A SECURITY THREAT </p><p>AT THIS POINT. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>POLITICAL "DIALOGUE" FINALLY IN SIGHT </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  THE COMMITMENTS TO MEET WITH POLITICAL LEADERS AND </p><p>TO CONVENE A NATIONAL CONVENTION ARE NOT NEW, AND MUST </p><p>BE SEEN IN THE CONTEXT OF THE SLORC\'S "DECLARATION </p><p>1/90" -- A CONVOLUTED ROADMAP FOR EFFECTIVELY NEGATING </p><p>THE RESULTS OF THE 1990 ELECTIONS.  ACCORDING TO THAT </p><p>DECLARATION, THE SOLE FUNCTION OF THE NATIONAL </p><p>CONVENTION WILL BE TO DRAFT A CONSTITUTION WHICH WILL </p><p>STILL BE SUBJECT TO APPROVAL BY SLORC AND POSSIBLY A </p><p>NATIONAL REFERENDUM.  ONLY AFTER ADOPTION OF THE </p><p>CONSTITUTION WOULD NEW ELECTIONS BE HELD AND POWER </p><p>TRANSFERRED TO A (LIKELY COSMETIC) CIVILIAN GOVERNMENT. </p><p> </p><p>8.  NEVERTHELESS, THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THE GOB HAS </p><p>PROVIDED ANY TIME FRAME FOR EVEN THESE INITIAL STEPS </p><p>TOWARD DRAFTING A CONSTITUTION.  IN FACT, FORMER </p><p>CHIEF OF STATE SAW MAUNG EXPLICITLY TOLD OUR CHARGE IN </p><p>JANUARY THAT THERE IS "NO TIME FRAME" FOR MOVES TOWARD </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL RULE.  INTELLIGENCE CHIEF KHIN NYUNT </p><p>AND OTHERS HAD ALSO INDICATED EARLIER THAT THE </p><p>POLITICAL PARTIES THEMSELVES WOULD BE EXPECTED TO TAKE </p><p>THE INITIATIVE FOR CONVENING A NATIONAL CONVENTION -- </p><p>AN INVITATION TO "SUICIDE" GIVEN THE GOB PENCHANT FOR </p><p>PICKING OFF THOSE WHO SHOW POLITICAL INITIATIVE.  NOW, </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT HAS PLEDGED TO START TALKS WITHIN TWO </p><p>MONTHS WITH THE LEADERS OF THE "POLITICAL PARTIES </p><p>EXISTING LAWFULLY" AND "INDIVIDUAL" MP\'S.  HOW THEY </p><p>WILL IMPLEMENT THIS AND WHETHER POLITICIANS WILL BE </p><p>FREE TO TAKE INDEPENDENT POSITIONS REMAINS TO BE </p><p>SEEN. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>BUT PARTICIPATION MAY BE LIMITED </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  BASED ON THE NEW LEADERSHIP\'S STATEMENT, THE GOB NOW </p><p>APPEARS WILLING TO SIT DOWN WITH SOME BUT NOT ALL OF </p><p>THOSE ELECTED TO PARLIAMENT IN THE MAY 1990 </p><p>ELECTIONS:  ACCORDING TO THE LATEST OFFICIAL </p><p>ANNOUNCEMENTS, 98 OF THE 485 ELECTED MP\'S HAVE EITHER </p><p>BEEN DISQUALIFIED (68), RESIGNED (12), OR DIED (8) </p><p>OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS.  AN ADDITIONAL 20 OR SO ARE </p><p>BELIEVED TO BE IN DETENTION, EITHER CONVICTED OR </p><p>AWAITING TRIAL BUT NOT YET FORMALLY DEREGISTERED BY </p><p>THE ELECTIONS COMMISSION.  OF THE ORIGINAL 235 PARTIES </p><p>FORMED IN 1989 AND THE 93 THAT CONTESTED THE 1990 </p><p>ELECTIONS, ONLY TEN REMAIN LEGAL.  AMONG THESE ARE THE </p><p>NATIONAL LEAGUE FOR DEMOCRACY (NLD), THE SHAN NLD, AND </p><p>THE PROGOVERNMENT NATIONAL UNITY PARTY, WHICH TOGETHER </p><p>ACCOUNTED FOR 423 OF THE ORIGINAL PARLIAMENTARIANS. </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT\'S REFERENCE TO "INDIVIDUAL" MPS </p><p>APPARENTLY INCLUDES TWO GROUPS:  THOSE ELECTED FROM </p><p>PARTIES WHICH HAVE SINCE BEEN ABOLISHED, AND A HANDFUL </p><p>OF NLD MPS WHO HAVE EITHER RESIGNED OR BEEN EXPELLED </p><p>FROM THE PARTY. </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>COMMENT AND RECOMMENDATION </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  THOUGH THERE ARE MANY UNCERTAINTIES AND CAVEATS </p><p>IN THE SLORC\'S SHORT STATEMENT, IT SEEMINGLY </p><p>REPRESENTS THE FIRST PROMISE OF A BREAK-UP OF BURMA\'S </p><p>POLITICAL LOGJAM.  WE CAN ONLY SPECULATE ON THE </p><p>FACTORS LEADING UP TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT BUT IT NOW </p><p>APPEARS SAW MAUNG -- DESPITE HIS LACK OF DAY-TO-DAY </p><p>MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS </p><p>-- MAY HAVE BEEN THE KEY IMPEDIMENT TO ANY POLITICAL </p><p>OPENING.  WHATEVER THE CASE, HIS DEPARTURE HAS </p><p>PROVIDED A CONVENIENT EXCUSE FOR THAN SHWE, PRESUMABLY </p><p>ACTING ON THE ADVICE OF KHIN NYUNT (AND POSSIBLY NE </p><p>WIN) TO MOVE FORWARD -- AT LEAST ON PAPER.  WHILE </p><p>DOMESTIC CONSIDERATIONS WERE PROBABLY KEY, WE ALSO </p><p>ASSUME THAT MOUNTING INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE -- </p><p>INCLUDING A MORE ACTIVE ROLE BY THE UNITED NATIONS AND </p><p>SOME QUIET ENCOURAGEMENT FROM CHINA -- MAY HAVE PUSHED </p><p>THE MILITARY IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION </p><p> </p><p>11.  WHILE ANY U.S. REACTION SHOULD UNDERSCORE THE </p><p>NEED FOR DEEDS RATHER THAN MERE WORDS, EMBASSY </p><p>BELIEVES IT MIGHT BE APPROPRIATE FOR DEPARTMENT TO </p><p>NOTE THE LATEST GOB COMMITMENTS AS A FIRST STEP TOWARD </p><p>GREATER RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND CONSTITUTIONAL </p><p>RULE.  ALONG THESE LINES, A NUANCED STATEMENT SHOULD </p><p>STRESS THAT WE WILL BE OBSERVING THE IMPLEMENTATION </p><p>(AND BROADENING) OF THIS PROGRAM WITH GREAT INTEREST. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HUDDLE </p><p></p></div>
