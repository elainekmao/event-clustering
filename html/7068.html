<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 001999 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/26/2013 </p><p>TAGS: AEMR, AMGT, PREL, ASEC, CASC, CVIS, EFIN, ETRD, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZO1: AMMAN SITREP 26 (4/03 1000 LOCAL) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM Gregory L. Berry for reasons 1.5 (B)(D). </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>General Overview </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) The Embassy will operate on a normal schedule April 3. </p><p> Consular services will be open.  Activities at the American </p><p>Language Center will remain suspended.  Movements of American </p><p>staff remain restricted. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>Consular Issues </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) No new issues. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>GOJ Actions/Statements </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) In an interview with the official news agency Petra </p><p>April 2, King Abdullah said that he is "in harmony with... </p><p>our people who reject the invasion of Iraq."  He said that </p><p>Jordan had used its good offices with influential countries </p><p>to avert the war.  He said that the Iraqi people should have </p><p>the right to choose their own leadership, and described as </p><p>"groundless" allegations that Jordan\'s airspace or territory </p><p>have been used for attacks on Iraq.  "Frankly speaking, we </p><p>have been asked to open our airspace for military airplanes, </p><p>but we firmly rejected that," he said.  The King\'s somewhat </p><p>stronger public stance against the war comes in reaction to </p><p>intense public pressure and nearly universal opposition to </p><p>the war. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>Security </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Jordanian police reported no significant </p><p>demonstrations last night (April 2).  They are, however, </p><p>expecting small demonstrations today (April 3) at the Union </p><p>University near the Sports City, and at Al-Ishra University </p><p>on the Airport Road south of Amman.  On Friday, April 4, </p><p>after prayers, the police are expecting a large march from </p><p>the Hussein Mosque in downtown Amman to the Municipality of </p><p>Amman offices.  This march has been approved by the </p><p>government.  Additional demonstrations are also anticipated </p><p>in Ma\'an, Irbid, Salt and the Bakaa and Wahdat Camps. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>Economic and Trade Developments </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) No new issues. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>Refugee/Humanitarian Issues </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.
