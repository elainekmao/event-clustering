<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 05 LIBREVILLE 000603 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR WILLIAMS </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA - T. WRAY </p><p>KINSHASA ALSO FOR BRAZZAVILLE OFFICE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/11/05 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINR, PREL, ECON, GB </p><p>SUBJECT:  OMAR BONGO AND THE GABONESE POLITICAL SCENE </p><p> </p><p>REFS: (A) STATE 56003 (NOTAL) </p><p>      (B) LIBREVILLE 75 (NOTAL) </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR REASONS 1.5 (B, D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) SUMMARY: AFTER NEARLY 34 YEARS IN OFFICE, GABONESE </p><p>PRESIDENT OMAR BONGO IS A WILY POLITICIAN WHO STILL HAS A </p><p>FIRM GRIP ON POWER.  HE IS UNQUESTIONABLY "THE BOSS" AND </p><p>MAINTAINS AN EXTENSIVE CIRCLE OF FAITHFUL AND PANDERING </p><p>ALLIES.  MANY REMAIN LOYAL LARGELY BECAUSE THEIR LOYALTY IS </p><p>RICHLY REWARDED WITH FINANCIAL AND JOB SECURITY.  PRESIDENT </p><p>BONGO\'S CURRENT TERM ENDS IN 2005, AND SPECULATION SURFACES </p><p>FREQUENTLY AS TO WHETHER HE IS GROOMING SOMEONE TO SUCCEED </p><p>HIM.  ALTHOUGH HE CLEARLY WATCHES THOSE CLOSEST TO HIM TO </p><p>EVALUATE THEIR POTENTIAL, BONGO DOES NOT APPEAR AS YET TO </p><p>HAVE CHOSEN ANYONE IN PARTICULAR, AND IS LIKELY BIDING HIS </p><p>TIME TO SEE WHO EMERGES AS A CAPABLE CANDIDATE WORTHY OF </p><p>HIS SUPPORT.  INEVITABLY, BONGO\'S OWN FATE WILL BE TIED TO </p><p>GABON\'S FALLING OIL REVENUES, VITAL TO HIS ABILITY TO KEEP </p><p>PEACE IN A COUNTRY WITH STAGGERING DISPARITIES IN WEALTH </p><p>AND SIMMERING ETHNIC PRESSURES.  THE DECEMBER LEGISLATIVE </p><p>ELECTIONS WILL BE AN INDICATOR OF BONGO\'S (AND HIS RULING </p><p>PARTY\'S) FUTURE, BUT MORE, OF HIS INCLINATION TO ALLOW </p><p>GABON\'S SLOW DEMOCRATIZATION PROCESS TO CONTINUE.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>BONGO: HE JUST KEEPS GOING AND GOING... </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) PRESIDENT EL HADJ OMAR BONGO IS FIRMLY IN CONTROL </p><p>IN GABON.  WHILE HE IS DEPENDENT ON THE ADVICE AND SUPPORT </p><p>HE RECEIVES FROM HIS INNER CIRCLE, THERE IS NO QUESTION OF </p><p>WHO CALLS THE SHOTS.  THOSE CLOSE TO HIM REFER TO HIM </p><p>UNSELFCONSCIOUSLY AS "LE PATRON" ("THE BOSS") AND REGARD </p><p>HIM WITH A COMBINATION OF AFFECTION AND RESPECT FOR HIS </p><p>POLITICAL WILES, HIS MASTERY OF DETAIL AND HIS PRODIGIOUS </p><p>MEMORY.  AFTER NEARLY 34 YEARS IN POWER, AND WITH THE HELP </p><p>OF GENEROUS OIL REVENUES, BONGO HAS ESTABLISHED A MASTERY </p><p>OF THE LEVERS OF INFLUENCE THAT NONE CAN CHALLENGE. </p><p>GABON\'S MINERAL WEALTH HAS MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR HIM TO </p><p>REWARD THOSE CLOSE TO HIM, ENSURING A STRONG SENSE OF </p><p>LOYALTY, AND TO PURCHASE THE COOPERATION OF THOSE IN </p><p>OPPOSITION.  INDEED, HE IS KNOWN AS A "SOFT TOUCH" FOR HIS </p><p>WILLINGNESS TO FINANCE ALMOST ANYONE WITH A PERSUASIVE </p><p>PROPOSAL.  AN EMBASSY CONTACT WHO KNOWS BONGO WELL SAYS </p><p>THAT HE IS PERENNIALLY SURPRISED AT THE NUMBER OF </p><p>INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE GRANTED SMALL FORTUNES BECAUSE OF THEIR </p><p>ABILITY TO CONVINCE THE PRESIDENT THAT THEIR SERVICES ARE </p><p>INDISPENSABLE TO HIS SURVIVAL IN OFFICE.  WHETHER THIS IS A </p><p>REFLECTION OF BONGO\'S NAIVETE OR HIS OWN WAY OF ACQUIRING </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) BONGO IS ALSO A CUNNING LEADER WHO ENJOYS </p><p>THOROUGHLY THE GAME OF POLITICS.  HE IS WELL INFORMED AND </p><p>BENEFITS FROM NETWORKS HE HAS PUT IN PLACE BOTH INSIDE AND </p><p>OUTSIDE GABON, INCLUDING AN ARRAY OF FEMALE "FRIENDS" WITH </p><p>WHOM HE MAINTAINS CLOSE RELATIONS.  BONGO PLACES GREAT </p><p>STOCK IN KNOWING PERSONALLY THE PLAYERS IN ANY ISSUE OF </p><p>IMPORTANCE.  AT THE SAME TIME, HE IS CAREFUL NOT TO </p><p>INITIATE ANY UNDERTAKING -- PARTICULARLY OUTSIDE GABON -- </p><p>WITHOUT A GOOD DEGREE OF CERTAINTY ABOUT THE OUTCOME.  FOR </p><p>EXAMPLE, ALTHOUGH HE CRAVES THE POSITIVE REFLECTION THAT </p><p>COMES FROM HIS SUCCESSFUL MEDIATION OF REGIONAL CONFLICTS, </p><p>BONGO ENGAGES IN SUCH EFFORTS ONLY AFTER CAREFUL </p><p>CONSIDERATION.  IN MEDIATING THE CIVIL WAR IN CONGO/B, FOR </p><p>EXAMPLE, HE MOVED CAUTIOUSLY, MAKING CERTAIN THAT EACH </p><p>INITIATIVE WAS ACCOMPANIED BY A THOROUGH ROUND OF MEETINGS </p><p>OF THE KEY PARTIES.  HIS HESITATION TO BECOME INVOLVED IN </p><p>THE CONGO/K DELIBERATIONS SHOWS SIMILAR CAUTION:  UNTIL ALL </p><p>OF THE PARTIES ASK HIM TO BE INVOLVED, AND HE CAN BE </p><p>RELATIVELY CONFIDENT OF SOME POSITIVE OUTCOME, BONGO IS </p><p>LIKELY TO LIMIT HIS INVOLVEMENT.  WHEN HE DOES CHOOSE TO </p><p>ACT, HIS YEARS IN OFFICE, AND THE NOT INCONSIDERABLE </p><p>INFLUENCE AS ELDER STATESMAN THAT HE ENJOYS AMONG AFRICANS, </p><p>ALLOW BONGO A WIDE MARGIN OF MANEUVER.  THE MANTLE OF </p><p>AUTHORITY -- BUTTRESSED BY A PERSONABLE AND EVEN CHARMING </p><p>EXTERIOR -- PROVIDES HIM WITH THE ABILITY TO SPEAK FRANKLY </p><p>TO PEOPLE, SOMETIMES TELLING THEM TRUTHS THAT OTHERS MIGHT </p><p>NOT BE ABLE TO SAY. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>BONGO\'S INNER CIRCLE </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) BONGO RELIES ON A RELATIVELY SMALL CIRCLE FOR </p><p>ADVICE.  NONETHELESS, AS DEMONSTRATED BY THE JANUARY </p><p>OUSTING OF EQUIPMENT MINISTER ZACHARIE MYBOTO (REF B), THE </p><p>LONGEST SERVING MEMBER OF THE PRESIDENT\'S CABINET, NO ONE </p><p>IN BONGO\'S INNER CIRCLE IS UNTOUCHABLE.  MINISTER OF </p><p>INTERIOR ANTOINE MBOUMBOU MIYAKOU IS ONE OF THE PRESIDENT\'S </p><p>MOST LOYAL FOLLOWERS AND TRUSTED ADVISORS.  BACKED BY THE </p><p>POLICE AND CONSIDERED BY SOME TO BE UNSCRUPULOUS IN HIS </p><p>ZEAL, MIYAKOU\'S LOYALTY KNOWS NO LIMITS.  HE PROVIDES BONGO </p><p>WITH POLITICAL ADVICE AND UNFAILING SUPPORT.  MIYAKOU IS </p><p>ALSO WELL-PLACED TO ASSIST "LE PATRON" BECAUSE OF HIS </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CONDUCT OF ELECTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) PRIME MINISTER JEAN-FRANCOIS NTOUTOUME-EMANE IS </p><p>ALSO A CLOSE ADVISOR, TO SOME DEGREE BY DEFAULT GIVEN HIS </p><p>POSITION.  BONGO AND THE PRIME MINISTER HAVE AT TIMES HAD </p><p>HEATED PUBLIC DISAGREEMENTS, AND BONGO MAY NOT TRUST (OR </p><p>EVEN LIKE) HIM.  THE PRESIDENT NONETHELESS RESPECTS </p><p>NTOUTOUME-EMANE\'S INTELLECT, CONSIDERED BY MANY TO BE THE </p><p>STRONGEST IN THE GOVERNMENT (ONE POPULAR NICKNAME FOR THE </p><p>PM IS "JACKY THOUSAND-ENCYCLOPEDIAS").  FOREIGN MINISTER </p><p>JEAN PING (WHO IN THE PAST ALSO HAD A RELATIONSHIP, </p><p>RESULTING IN A CHILD, WITH PRESIDENTIAL DAUGHTER AND </p><p>ADVISER PASCALINE BONGO) IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE GABONESE EXPERT </p><p>ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS, AND ADVISES BONGO ACCORDINGLY.  HE HAS </p><p>LITTLE INFLUENCE ON DOMESTIC AFFAIRS, HOWEVER, AND DOES NOT </p><p>APPEAR TO BE PERSONALLY CLOSE TO THE PRESIDENT.  REFORM- </p><p>MINDED FINANCE MINISTER EMILE DOUMBA IS BONGO\'S PRIMARY </p><p>RESOURCE FOR ECONOMIC ADVICE, BUT IS SIMILARLY OUTSIDE THE </p><p>CIRCLE OF "PRESIDENTIAL INTIMATES." </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) OTHER INDIVIDUALS UPON WHOM THE PRESIDENT RELIES </p><p>INCLUDE AGING SENATE PRESIDENT GEORGES RAWIRI, WHO IS SEEN </p><p>BY MANY AS THE MAN MOST LIKELY TO REPLACE BONGO IN THE </p><p>SHORT TERM IF THE PRESIDENT WERE SUDDENLY TO EXIT THE </p><p>SCENE.  EDUCATION MINISTER AND GOVERNMENT SPOKESMAN ANDRE </p><p>MBA OBAME AND PRESIDENTIAL SON AND DEFENSE MINISTER ALI-BEN </p><p>BONGO ALSO PLAY BOTH POLITICAL AND POLICY ADVISING ROLES, </p><p>AND FREQUENTLY WORK TOGETHER TO ACHIEVE COMMON GOALS (SEE </p><p>REF B).  MINISTER OF MINES, ENERGY, AND PETROLEUM PAUL </p><p>TOUNGUI IS AN ADVISOR OF APPARENTLY GROWING INFLUENCE.  HE </p><p>IS INTELLIGENT, TECHNICALLY COMPETENT, AND HEADS THE MOST </p><p>POWERFUL MINISTRY IN THE GOVERNMENT.  OTHER BONGO </p><p>CONFIDANTS INCLUDE FORMER CAMPAIGN ASSISTANT NGOYOU </p><p>MOUSSAVOU, VICE PRESIDENT DIDJOB DIVUNGI DI NDINGE, AND </p><p>ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COUNCIL CHAIRMAN LOUIS GASTON MAYILA. </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>RELATIONSHIPS </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) RELATIONSHIPS ARE EVERYTHING IN THIS SMALL </p><p>COUNTRY, WHERE VIRTUALLY ALL OF THE PROMINENT FAMILIES ARE </p><p>RELATED IN SOME WAY TO PRESIDENT BONGO AND TO EACH OTHER. </p><p>AT TIMES GABON CAN SEEM LIKE AN AFRICAN PEYTON PLACE.  IN </p><p>ADDITION TO PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS, ETHNICITY PLAYS A VITAL </p><p>ROLE IN ALLIANCES.  BONGO HAS BEEN VERY CAREFUL TO APPEASE </p><p>DIFFERENT ETHNIC GROUPS BY PARCELING OUT CHOICE POSITIONS </p><p>AMONG THEM.  SOME CONSIDER THE SECRET TO BONGO\'S LONGEVITY </p><p>TO BE HIS ABILITY TO BALANCE THE DESIRES OF THE LARGER </p><p>GABONESE ETHNIC GROUPS.  AS A MEMBER OF ONE OF THE </p><p>COUNTRY\'S SMALLER GROUPS (BATEKE), HE HAS SUCCESSFULLY </p><p>POSITIONED HIMSELF ABOVE THE ETHNIC FRAY WHILE KEEPING THE </p><p>LARGER GROUPS (E.G., THE FANG AND BAPOUNOU) QUIESCENT.  ONE </p><p>RESULT OF BONGO\'S CONSTANT EFFORTS TO APPEASE DIFFERENT </p><p>ETHNIC GROUPS HAS BEEN TO CREATE MINISTRIES HEADED AND </p><p>STAFFED BY ONE ETHNIC GROUP OR ANOTHER.  THOUGH POLITICALLY </p><p>EFFECTIVE, THE PRACTICE HAS NOT LED TO COOPERATIVE OR </p><p>EFFICIENT INTERMINISTERIAL OPERATIONS.  AT THE CABINET </p><p>LEVEL, ETHNIC CONSIDERATIONS CREATE SHIFTING ALLIANCES </p><p>AMONG BONGO ADVISORS.  CURRENTLY, FOR EXAMPLE, ALI-BEN </p><p>BONGO IS CLOSE TO GENERAL NGUETSARA, THE CANTANKEROUS HEAD </p><p>OF THE GENERAL OFFICE FOR DOCUMENTATION AND IMMIGRATION. </p><p>AT THE SAME TIME, ALI-BEN AND EDUCATION MINISTER MBA OBAME </p><p>ARE PERCEIVED AS GOOD (PERHAPS "VERY GOOD," ACCORDING TO </p><p>SALACIOUS RUMORS) FRIENDS, AND ALI-BEN MAINTAINS CLOSE TIES </p><p>TO TRANSPORTATION MINISTER IDRISS NGARI. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>SUCCESSION </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) OMAR BONGO HAS GIVEN NO INDICATION YET THAT HE IS </p><p>GROOMING SOMEONE PARTICULAR TO SUCCEED HIM IN 2005. </p><p>INDEED, WHETHER BONGO, WHO IS 67, WILL SEEK RE-ELECTION IN </p><p>2005 REMAINS AMBIGUOUS, THOUGH MANY ASSUME HE WILL NOT. </p><p>BONGO IS EXTREMELY CAUTIOUS WHEN IT COMES TO PROTECTING HIS </p><p>OWN IMAGE; HE WOULD NOT WANT TO BE CAUGHT BACKING ANYONE </p><p>BUT THE EVENTUAL WINNER.  BONGO WILL NOT THROW HIS SUPPORT </p><p>BEHIND ANYONE WHO HAS A CHANCE OF LOSING, THEREBY </p><p>TARNISHING THE PRESIDENT\'S LEGACY.  AT THE SAME TIME, HE </p><p>APPEARS TO HAVE NO INTEREST YET IN ENDOWING ANY OF HIS </p><p>FOLLOWERS WITH "HEIR APPARENT" CREDENTIALS.  MOST BELIEVE </p><p>BONGO IS BIDING HIS TIME, WATCHING FOR A CANDIDATE TO PROVE </p><p>HIMSELF, BUILD A (NON-THREATENING) CONSTITUENCY, </p><p>DEMONSTRATE HIS CAPABILITIES, AND THEREBY EARN THE </p><p>PRESIDENT\'S SUPPORT.  BONGO IS BOTH VERY CAUTIOUS AND A </p><p>REALIST.  ONE OF THE CHARACTERISTICS HE WILL BE LOOKING FOR </p><p>IN A SUCCESSOR WILL BE THAT INDIVIDUAL\'S ABILITY TO PROMOTE </p><p>STABILITY IN THE MIRE OF TURMOIL THAT IS CENTRAL AFRICA. </p><p>BONGO TAKES HIS ROLE AS THE REGION\'S "DOYEN " -- A MEDIATOR </p><p>AND PEACEMAKER -- SERIOUSLY.  HE WILL SUPPORT SOMEONE </p><p>WORTHY OF CARRYING ON THAT ROLE. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) DEFENSE MINISTER ALI-BEN BONGO IS ONE PERSON </p><p>PRESIDENT BONGO MAY BE WATCHING AS A POSSIBLE SUCCESSOR. </p><p>IF THIS IS THE CASE, BEING THE PRESIDENT\'S SON WILL NOT </p><p>NECESSARILY GIVE HIM AN ADVANTAGE OVER OTHERS.  HE WILL </p><p>NEED TO PROVE HIMSELF LIKE THE REST.  A FORMER FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER, THE YOUNGER BONGO HAS INCREASED HIS VISIBILITY IN </p><p>RECENT MONTHS.  IN FEBRUARY HE ORGANIZED A "NATIONAL </p><p>MILITARY DAY," CELEBRATED BY PARADES TO SHOW OFF NEW </p><p>UNIFORMS HE PURCHASED FOR THE ARMED FORCES.  DURING A </p><p>FEBRUARY TRIP TO GERMANY HE ARRANGED FOR THE GABONESE </p><p>MILITARY TO PURCHASE 600 MERCEDES TRUCKS OVER THE NEXT </p><p>SEVERAL YEARS.  THE YOUNGER BONGO IS EAGER TO INCREASE THE </p><p>MILITARY\'S CAPABILITIES AND PROFESSIONALISM, </p><p>ENTHUSIASTICALLY SUPPORTING PARTICIPATION IN U.S. IMET </p><p>TRAINING PROGRAMS AND HOSTING A VARIETY OF MILITARY </p><p>EXERCISES AND CONFERENCES.  ALI-BEN BONGO, WHO CONVERTED TO </p><p>ISLAM WITH HIS FATHER IN THE 1970S, ALSO STYLES HIMSELF A </p><p>LEADER OF GABON\'S MUSLIMS AND, IN THAT ROLE, IS A USEFUL </p><p>EAR FOR THE ELDER BONGO IN THAT SMALL (ABOUT 5 PERCENT OF </p><p>THE GABONESE) BUT INFLUENTIAL COMMUNITY. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) MINES, ENERGY, AND PETROLEUM MINISTER PAUL TOUNGUI </p><p>ALSO GIVES SIGNS OF RECEIVING GROWING SUPPORT FROM </p><p>PRESIDENT BONGO.  RECENTLY PROMOTED TO THE RANK OF MINISTER </p><p>OF STATE (REF B), TOUNGUI IS A LONGTIME ADVISOR TO THE </p><p>PRESIDENT WITH A REPUTATION AS A CLEVER ADMINISTRATOR AND </p><p>POLITICAL MANEUVERER.  MANY TOOK TOUNGUI\'S RECENT PROMOTION </p><p>AS A SIGN THAT PRESIDENT BONGO IS DRAWING HIM CLOSER TO THE </p><p>CENTER OF POWER.  TOUNGUI\'S RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PRESIDENT </p><p>IS FURTHER REINFORCED BY HIS LONG-TERM AMOROUS RELATIONSHIP </p><p>(OR "MARRIAGE", AS IT IS DESCRIBED HERE) WITH BONGO\'S </p><p>DAUGHTER AND NOMINAL CHIEF OF STAFF, PASCALINE. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>ECONOMICS AND CORRUPTION </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) THE MOST SERIOUS THREAT TO GABON\'S LONG-TERM </p><p>STABILITY (AND TO BONGO\'S REGIME) IS THE EXPECTED DECREASE </p><p>IN OIL REVENUES.  BONGO\'S ABILITY TO USE THIS CONSIDERABLE </p><p>WEALTH TO REWARD AND ENRICH POWERFUL INDIVIDUALS AND GROUPS </p><p>WITHIN THE COUNTRY HAS BEEN THE KEY TO HIS MAINTAINING </p><p>STABILITY AND PRESERVING POWER FOR THE PAST THREE DECADES. </p><p>AFTER REACHING A HIGH OF 18.5 MILLION TONS IN 1998, OIL </p><p>PRODUCTION DECREASED TO 13.5 MILLION TONS IN 2000 AND MAY </p><p>FALL TO AS LITTLE AS 6.5 MILLION TONS IN 2005.  WHILE DEEP- </p><p>WATER EXPLORATION CONTINUES OFFSHORE, THERE IS VIRTUALLY NO </p><p>HOPE THAT GABON WILL BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN ITS CURRENT </p><p>DEPENDENCE ON OIL REVENUES IN THE MEDIUM AND LONG TERMS. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C) BEFORE THE ARRIVAL OF FINANCE MINISTER EMILE </p><p>DOUMBA IN 1999, THE SYSTEM OF DISPENSING GOVERNMENT REVENUE </p><p>WAS COMPLETELY ARBITRARY AND UNDISCIPLINED.  DESPITE </p><p>DOUMBA\'S PROGRESS IN REIGNING IN OFF-BUDGET EXPENDITURES, </p><p>PRESIDENT BONGO CONTINUES TO EXERCISE PERSONAL CONTROL OVER </p><p>A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF GOVERNMENT REVENUE.  BONGO </p><p>UNDOUBTEDLY SETS THE TONE AND IS AWARE OF THE WORST </p><p>EXAMPLES OF CORRUPTION WITHIN HIS ADMINISTRATION, BUT </p><p>RARELY TAKES ANY ACTION TO CONTROL IT.  BOWING TO PRESSURE </p><p>FROM THE IMF, AN ANTI-CORRUPTION BILL WAS RECENTLY AND </p><p>BELATEDLY INTRODUCED TO THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY.  THE </p><p>LEGISLATION IS CURRENTLY UNDERGOING "SOFTENING", HOWEVER, </p><p>AND SEEMS UNLIKELY TO HAVE AS MUCH AFFECT ON BONGO\'S WAY OF </p><p>OPERATING AS THE LOSS OF OIL REVENUE.  BONGO ALSO </p><p>ENGINEERED PASSAGE OF A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT IN LATE </p><p>2000 THAT PROVIDES THE PRESIDENT ABSOLUTE IMMUNITY FOR </p><p>ACTIONS TAKEN WHILE IN OFFICE.  MANY READ THE MOVE AT THE </p><p>TIME AS A SIGN OF BONGO LAYING THE GROUNDWORK FOR AN </p><p>EVENTUAL "GRACEFUL" DEPARTURE FROM POWER. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C) GABON DOES NOT HAVE A GREAT DEAL TO SHOW FOR OVER </p><p>TWO DECADES OF WINDFALL OIL REVENUES, ASIDE FROM THE </p><p>PRIVATE WEALTH ACCUMULATED BY A RELATIVELY FEW INDIVIDUALS </p><p>CLOSE TO THE PRESIDENT.  THE LARGE MAJORITY OF THE </p><p>COUNTRY\'S WEALTH IS ESTIMATED TO BE HELD BY LESS THAN </p><p>50,000 OF ITS 1.2 MILLION CITIZENS, ALTHOUGH THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>IS CAREFUL NOT TO COLLECT OR PUBLISH STATISTICS THAT WOULD </p><p>ALLOW A RELIABLE ASSESSMENT.  DESPITE THE LACK OF DATA, </p><p>WORLD BANK ANALYSTS PRIVATELY ESTIMATE THAT GABON MAY HAVE </p><p>ONE OF THE HIGHEST INCOME DISPARITIES OF ANY COUNTRY IN THE </p><p>WORLD.  ONE THING THAT IS CLEAR IS THAT ONCE THERE IS NO </p><p>LONGER A STEADY FLOW OF CASH TO CALM THOSE WHO MIGHT </p><p>PROTEST SUCH INEQUALITY, BONGO (OR WHOEVER REPLACES HIM) </p><p>WILL BE LEFT TO RELY ON HIS CONSIDERABLE OTHER SKILLS OF </p><p>PERSUASION TO PREVENT DISSATISFACTION FROM GETTING OUT OF </p><p>CONTROL. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>UPCOMING LEGISLATIVE ELECTIONS </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>15.  (C) THE UPCOMING DECEMBER LEGISLATIVE ELECTIONS, AND </p><p>THE SUCCESS OR FAILURE OF THE OPPOSITION, WILL PROVIDE SOME </p><p>MEASURE OF THE GABONESE PEOPLE\'S SATISFACTION WITH THE </p><p>STATUS QUO.  THE ELECTIONS WILL UNDOUBTEDLY TEST PRESIDENT </p><p>BONGO\'S SKILLS OF PERSUASION AND DEMONSTRATE THE EXTENT OF </p><p>HIS POLITICAL INFLUENCE.  THE ELECTIONS WILL BE THE FIRST </p><p>TO OCCUR SINCE BONGO WAS RETURNED FOR A FIFTH TERM IN 1998. </p><p>THOSE ELECTIONS, THOUGH UNQUESTIONABLY MORE OPEN THAN THEIR </p><p>PREDECESSORS, WERE MARRED BY IRREGULARITIES THAT GENERALLY </p><p>FAVORED THE INCUMBENT, INCLUDING INCOMPLETE AND INACCURATE </p><p>ELECTORAL LISTS AND THE USE OF FALSE DOCUMENTS TO CAST </p><p>VOTES.  DESPITE THE FLAWS, MOST INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS </p><p>CONCLUDED AT THE TIME THAT THE RESULT GENERALLY REFLECTED </p><p>THE POPULAR WILL.  THE OPPOSITION BELIEVES THE RULING PARTY </p><p>(PARTI DEMOCRATIQUE GABONAIS -- PDG) FIXED THE 1998 </p><p>ELECTIONS, AND MANY GABONESE ANTICIPATE SIMILAR BEHAVIOR </p><p>THIS YEAR.  THE ACCUSATION TENDS, HOWEVER, TO GLOSS OVER </p><p>THE FACT THAT THE OPPOSITION RAN A FRAGMENTED AND FECKLESS </p><p>CAMPAIGN.  BONGO HIMSELF IS CLEARLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE </p><p>UPCOMING ELECTIONS, BUT IT IS TOO EARLY TO TELL WHETHER HIS </p><p>PARTY FACES ANY REAL DANGER OF LOSING ITS MAJORITY IN </p><p>PARLIAMENT.  THE CAMPAIGN WILL ALSO BE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR </p><p>THE OPPOSITION TO DEMONSTRATE WHETHER IT LEARNED FROM ITS </p><p>1998 MISTAKES. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>OPPOSITION LEADERS IN GABON </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>16.  (C) BONGO\'S WIN IN 1998 WEAKENED AND DISHEARTENED THE </p><p>ALREADY FRAGMENTED GABONESE OPPOSITION.  AFTER 34 YEARS OF </p><p>THE SAME PARTY IN POWER, THE POPULATION HAS GROWN </p><p>APATHETIC, WITH MANY YOUNGER PEOPLE REFUSING TO GO TO THE </p><p>TROUBLE TO VOTE.  BONGO\'S APPROACH IN DEALING WITH THE </p><p>OPPOSITION HAS MIRRORED HIS MANAGEMENT OF THE GOVERNMENT: </p><p>PAYOFFS AND CO-OPTATION.  FEW OPPOSITION LEADERS HAVE </p><p>RESISTED HIS TEMPTATIONS, FURTHER REDUCING THEIR INFLUENCE </p><p>WITH A CYNICAL ELECTORATE.  IN THE NEAR TERM, WE EXPECT THE </p><p>OPPOSITION TO REMAIN RELATIVELY WEAK UNLESS RADICAL EVENTS </p><p>SHAKE BONGO\'S GRIP ON POWER. </p><p> </p><p>17.  (C) FORMER FINANCE MINISTER AND BONGO ALLY-TURNED- </p><p>OPPONENT JEAN-PIERRE LEMBOUMBA IS NOT PARTICULARLY VISIBLE </p><p>IN THE GABONESE POLITICAL SCENE TODAY.  KNOWN TO HAVE </p><p>AMASSED CONSIDERABLE WEALTH AS A RESULT OF CROOKED DEALINGS </p><p>DURING HIS FINANCE MINISTRY DAYS, LEMBOUMBA NOW LIMITS HIS </p><p>POLITICAL ACTIVITY TO FINANCING OPPOSITION PARTIES AND </p><p>NEWSPAPERS.  RUMORS CONTEND THAT HE MAY HAVE RECONCILED </p><p>WITH BONGO AND MADE A DEAL, PROMISING TO TONE DOWN HIS </p><p>OPPOSITION RHETORIC. </p><p> </p><p>18.  (C) PIERRE MAMBOUNDOU, PRESIDENT OF THE GABONESE </p><p>PEOPLE\'S UNION (UPG), IS KNOWN AS THE LEADER OF THE "REAL" </p><p>OPPOSITION.  THE SECOND-PLACE FINISHER IN THE 1998 </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS, MAMBOUNDOU HEADS THE HIGH COUNCIL </p><p>OF THE RESISTANCE, A GROUP OF TEN OPPOSITION PARTIES THAT </p><p>MEETS WEEKLY TO STRATEGIZE.  A REPUTEDLY HONEST MAN WHO </p><p>SUPPORTS HIS CLAIMS WITH FACTS, HE MAY BE THE ONLY MAJOR </p><p>OPPOSITION FIGURE WHO HAS NOT TAKEN MONEY FROM BONGO. </p><p> </p><p>19.  (C) MANY CONTEND THAT LONG-TIME OPPOSITION LEADER AND </p><p>LIBREVILLE MAYOR PAUL MBA-ABESSOLE IS NO LONGER A SERIOUS </p><p>THREAT TO THE PRESIDENT.  FATHER MBA-ABESSOLE (HE IS ALSO A </p><p>CATHOLIC PRIEST), WHO LEADS GABON\'S OLDEST AND LARGEST </p><p>OPPOSITION PARTY, IS WIDELY VIEWED TO HAVE BEEN CO-OPTED BY </p><p>BONGO.  HIS PARTY, LONG CALLED THE NATIONAL RALLY OF </p><p>LUMBERJACKS, RECENTLY CHANGED ITS NAME TO THE LESS COLORFUL </p><p>"RALLY FOR GABON".  THE NAME CHANGE WAS ACCOMPANIED BY AN </p><p>AIRING OF THE PARTY\'S DIRTY LAUNDRY, WITH THE MORE VOCAL </p><p>CRITICS OF THE REGIME LEAVING TO CHART THEIR OWN POLITICAL </p><p>COURSE.  DURING THIS STRIFE THE PARTY NEWSPAPER "LE </p><p>RASSEMBLEUR" (FORMERLY "LE BUCHERON" -- "THE LUMBERJACK"), </p><p>WHICH FOR YEARS PUBLISHED SCATHING ALLEGATIONS OF </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL CORRUPTION, HAS CONSIDERABLY TONED DOWN ITS </p><p>ATTACKS. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>CONCLUSION </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>20.  (C) OMAR BONGO HAS BECOME ONE OF AFRICA\'S (AND THE </p><p>WORLD\'S) LONGEST-SERVING HEADS OF STATE BY BUILDING A </p><p>CAREFUL BALANCE OF COMPETING ETHNIC INTERESTS AND OILING IT </p><p>GENEROUSLY WITH PETROLEUM REVENUES.  AS THE OIL MONEY DRIES </p><p>UP, BONGO -- OR HIS SUCCESSOR -- WILL FIND THE MACHINE </p><p>INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT TO KEEP RUNNING.  FOR NOW, HOWEVER, </p><p>SATISFACTION WITH THE STATUS QUO ON THE PART OF THOSE WHO </p><p>BENEFIT FROM IT, AND FEAR OF THE STRIFE THAT MIGHT REPLACE </p><p>IT ON THE PART OF THOSE WHO DON\'T, KEEP BONGO FIRMLY IN </p><p>CONTROL.  FOR THAT REASON THE DECEMBER LEGISLATIVE </p><p>ELECTIONS WILL LIKELY SAY MORE ABOUT THE REGIME\'S </p><p>WILLINGNESS TO CONTINUE TO RELAX ITS CONTROLS ON GABON\'S </p><p>VERSION OF DEMOCRACY THAN THEY WILL ABOUT HOW GABON WILL BE </p><p>GOVERNED IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS. </p><p> </p><p>LEDESMA </p><p></p></div>
