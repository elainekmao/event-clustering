<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HANOI 000598 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV, DRL, PRM, INR </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR EAST ASIAN DIRECTORATE </p><p>SECDEF FOR ISA/EAP STERN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL: 03/14/10 </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  00598  01 OF 02  150056Z </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, KIRF, SOCI, VM, ETMIN, HUMANR, RELFREE </p><p>SUBJECT: DIFFERENT VIEW OF HIGHLAND EVENTS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) CLASSIFIED BY DENNIS G. HARTER, CHARGE </p><p>D\'AFFAIRES, REASONS: 1.5 B AND D. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) SWEDISH DCM TOLD CHARGE SHE BELIEVED THE </p><p>REPORTS OF UNREST IN THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS HAVE BEEN </p><p>HIGHLY EXAGGERATED AND BELIEVES FIRST DEMONSTRATIONS </p><p>OCCURRED IN LATE JANUARY WELL BEFORE PUBLICITY OF </p><p>FEBRUARY EVENTS HIT THE U.S. AND OTHER INTERNATIONAL </p><p>REPORTING.  SHE CLAIMS THE TWO RELIGIOUS WORKERS WHO </p><p>WERE DETAINED IN LATE JANUARY WERE DETAINED BECAUSE OF </p><p>DEMONSTRATIONS IN THE AREA BUT ALSO ASSERTS THE </p><p>DEMONSTRATIONS HAD LITTLE OR NO RELIGIOUS CONNECTIONS. </p><p>THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT APPARENTLY RELEASED THESE </p><p>INDIVIDUALS RATHER QUICKLY AFTER DECIDING THEIR </p><p>INITIAL ARREST WAS UNWARRANTED.  DCM DAHLIN SAID THERE </p><p>ARE A NUMBER OF REASONS FOR THE PROBLEMS IN THE </p><p>HIGHLANDS AND THE MOST SERIOUS IS THE ISSUE OF LAND </p><p>USAGE. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) ACCORDING TO DCM DAHLIN, HANOI AUTHORITIES </p><p>DECIDED IN JANUARY TO OPT FOR THE LARGE-SCALE </p><p>DAM/ELECTRICITY PROJECT IN SON LA RATHER THAN THE </p><p>SMALLER VERSION WHICH WOULD HAVE REQUIRED LESS </p><p>DISLOCATION OF THE LOCAL POPULATION.  THIS DECISION </p><p>MEANT THAT 150,000 PEOPLE WILL HAVE TO BE RELOCATED </p><p>OUT OF THE SON LA REGION AND THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS WAS </p><p>DESIGNATED TO RECEIVE THESE INDIVIDUALS/FAMILIES.  IN </p><p>ADDITION TO LOCAL CONCERNS ABOUT THE EXPANSION OF </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00598  01 OF 02  150056Z </p><p>PLANTATION AGRICULTURE, RELOCATION OF POOR VIETNAMESE </p><p>INTO THE HIGHLANDS AND THEIR CONSEQUENT OCCUPATION OF </p><p>TRADITIONAL TRIBAL LANDS, THIS NEW INFLUX OF PEOPLE </p><p>APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN A MAJOR CAUSE OF LOCAL CONCERN. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) DAHLIN EXPLAINED THAT THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES AND </p><p>THE LOCAL MILITIA/POLICE FORCES REPRESENT THE LOWEST </p><p>LEVEL OF QUALITY IN THE VIETNAMESE BUREAUCRATIC AND </p><p>SECURITY HIERARCHY.  ANYBODY WHO HAS ANY SKILLS OR ANY </p><p>CONNECTIONS GETS OUT OF THIS AREA, IF THEY ARE EVER </p><p>EVEN ASSIGNED THERE.  THIS HAS MEANT A STEADY RUN OF </p><p>UNRESPONSIVE LOCAL OFFICIALS WHO CONTINUE TO LINE </p><p>THEIR OWN POCKETS THROUGH EXPLOITATION OF THE DEMAND </p><p>FOR ACCESS TO LOCAL LANDS FOR AGRICULTURAL PURPOSES. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) PUBLIC RESENTMENT ON RELIGIOUS GROUNDS HAS ALSO </p><p>OCCURRED FROM TIME TO TIME BECAUSE LOCAL OFFICIALS </p><p>HAVE ACTED TO DISRUPT HOUSE CHURCH ACTIVITIES AND TO </p><p>TEAR DOWN "ILLEGAL" STRUCTURES.  BUT, DAHLIN SAID, </p><p>THERE APPEARS TO BE NO REAL EVIDENCE THIS WAS INVOLVED </p><p>IN THE RECENT EVENTS OF FEBRUARY.  SHE NOTES THERE WAS </p><p>NO RPT NO INDICATION OF DEMONSTRATIONS IN THE HIGHLAND </p><p>PROVINCE OF LAM DONG, THE ONE PROVINCE IN THE REGION </p><p>WHERE THE CENTRAL AUTHORITIES HAVE ALREADY DECIDED </p><p>THERE IS NO POSSIBILITY OF PERMITTING ADDITIONAL </p><p>RESETTLEMENT BECAUSE OF THE EXTREME POVERTY OF THE </p><p>AREA.  SHE BELIEVES, AS DO HER SOURCES, THAT THE LAND </p><p>ISSUE HAS BEEN AND REMAINS THE NUMBER ONE PROBLEM IN </p><p>THE REGION. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) BASED ON DISCUSSIONS WITH FOREIGNERS AND </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  00598  01 OF 02  150056Z </p><p>VIETNAMESE FRIENDS WHO WERE IN THE AREA DURING THE </p><p>DEMONSTRATIONS, DAHLIN ALSO SAID THE NUMBERS OF </p><p>DEMONSTRATORS REPORTED IN PRESS STORIES ARE WIDELY </p><p>EXAGGERATED.  SHE SAID THE LARGEST DEMONSTRATION WAS </p><p>PROBABLY NO MORE THAN A THOUSAND PEOPLE, STILL A </p><p>CONSIDERABLE NUMBER FOR SUCH AN EVENT, GATHERED FROM A </p><p>NUMBER OF DIFFERENT VILLAGES IN BOTH GIA LAI AND DAK </p><p>LAK.  BUT THIS NUMBER IS WELL UNDER THE 10 TO 20,000 </p><p>WHICH SOME SOURCES HAVE CLAIMED WERE ASSEMBLED. </p><p>THERE WAS ROCK-THROWING, CLASHES WITH THE POLICE, AND </p><p>CERTAINLY FLAGS AND BANNERS ADVOCATING THE FOUNDATION </p><p>OF THE "DEGA KINGDOM" AS OUTSIDERS CLAIMED AND THE </p><p>VIETNAMESE GOVERNMENT HAS ACKNOWLEDGED. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) DAHLIN RECOUNTED ATTENDING AN EARLY-FEBRUARY </p><p>FUNCTION AT WHICH A NUMBER OF VIETNAMESE MILITARY WERE </p><p>PRESENT AND SHE HEARD THEM LAUGHING AND SAW THEM </p><p>STANDING UP TO TOAST THE "NEW STATE OF DEGA."  ASKED </p><p>WHAT WAS GOING ON THEY RECOUNTED THE HIGHLAND </p><p>DEMONSTRATIONS AND BANNERS WITH MUCH LAUGHTER AND </p><p>CLEARLY HAD NO CONCERNS THAT THIS REPRESENTED ANY KIND </p><p>OF "THREAT" TO THE AUTHORITIES OR TO STABILITY IN THE </p><p>REGION. DAHLIN SAID THE DISPATCH OF MILITARY PERSONNEL </p><p>IN FEBRUARY TO THE AREA REPRESENTED CLEAR INDICATION </p><p>THE JANUARY EVENTS HAD NOT BEEN REPORTED IN TIME TO </p><p>THE CENTRAL AUTHORITIES.  IF IT HAD BEEN REPORTED BY </p><p>THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, DAHLIN BELIEVED THE </p><p>VIETNAMESE WOULD HAVE FIRST SENT SENIOR PARTY AND </p><p>GOVERNMENT PERSONNEL TO THE AREA TO TRY TO DEFUSE THE </p><p>SITUATION.  THAT THEY DID SEND THE MILITARY WAS </p><p>PROBABLY STILL AN EFFORT BY THE HANOI LEADERS TO </p><p>DEFUSE THIS ISSUE, SINCE THEY TOO RECOGNIZED THE USE </p><p>OF LOCAL POLICE OR MILITIA FORCES WOULD ONLY HAVE </p><p>INFLAMED CONFRONTATIONS WITH THE LOCAL POPULATION. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) DAHLIN ACKNOWLEDGED THERE WAS VIOLENCE IN THE </p><p>EARLY FEBRUARY DEMONSTRATIONS AND ATTRIBUTES PART OF </p><p>THIS TO THE FACT THERE APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN NO </p><p>RESPONSE TO POPULAR PROTEST TOWARD THE END OF JANUARY. </p><p>ACCORDING TO DAHLIN, WHEN THE FIRST PROTESTS OCCURRED </p><p>VINACAFE AND OTHER PLANTATION OWNERS SENT SOME OF </p><p>THEIR "SECURITY GUARDS" TO BREAK UP THE </p><p>DEMONSTRATIONS.  SHE IMPLIED THEY HAD BEEN RESPONSIBLE </p><p>FOR MUCH OF THE EARLY VIOLENCE AND IT WAS IN PART IN </p><p>PROTEST TO THIS ACTIVITY THAT THE SECOND GATHERINGS </p><p>OCCURRED.  HIGHLANDER ATTACKS AGAINST THE POLICE ALSO </p><p>INDICATED LONG-TERM UNHAPPINESS WITH THE WAY IN WHICH </p><p>THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES HAVE ADMINISTERED </p><p>GOVERNMENT/SECURITY ISSUES IN THE AREA. AND, SHE SAID, </p><p>THE GATHERING OF THE POPULACE AND THEIR FEELING OF </p><p>"POWER" IN THEIR NUMBERS PROBABLY ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO </p><p>THE CONFRONTATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) ASKED ABOUT THE LIKELIHOOD OF EXTERNAL </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00598  02 OF 02  140930Z </p><p>AGITATION OR INVOLVEMENT IN THE EVENTS, DAHLIN </p><p>RESPONDED SHE HEARD OF NO SUCH CONNECTIONS.  SHE </p><p>BELIEVES THE INFORMATION ON THE LOCAL COMPLAINTS AND </p><p>PLANS FOR COORDINATED DEMONSTRATIONS WAS SPREAD BY </p><p>WORD OF MOUTH AND THROUGH THE OMNIPRESENT CELL PHONES </p><p>WHICH ARE WIDELY SEEN AROUND THE MAJOR CITIES EVEN IN </p><p>THE HIGHLANDS. FOREIGN OBSERVERS IN THE REGION -- </p><p>FINLAND AND DENMARK HAD AID WORKERS THERE -- WERE </p><p>ENCOURAGED BY THEIR COUNTERPARTS TO TAKE HOLIDAYS IN </p><p>THE COASTAL AREAS BECAUSE THERE WAS A GENUINE DESIRE </p><p>TO ENSURE THEY WERE NOT HURT IN THE MIDST OF ANY </p><p>CONFRONTATIONS BETWEEN THE LOCAL POPULATION AND THE </p><p>MILITARY.  DEMONSTRATING THE INEPTITUDE OF LOCAL </p><p>AUTHORITIES, DAHLIN SAID AN INDONESIAN COFFEE </p><p>DELEGATION TRAVELING BY VAN IN DAK LAK WAS APPREHENDED </p><p>BY MILITIA FORCES AND WAS EXCLUDED FROM FURTHER TRAVEL </p><p>IN THE AREA BECAUSE "THEIR TRIBE DID NOT HAVE </p><p>SETTLEMENTS IN THAT PART OF DAK LAK." </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) CHARGE ASKED DAHLIN WHO IF ANYONE HAD GONE </p><p>BACK IN AND WHETHER SHE -- BECAUSE OF SWEDEN\'S SPECIAL </p><p>RELATIONSHIP WITH VIETNAM -- MIGHT TRY TO BE AMONG THE </p><p>FIRST TO RETURN TO THE AREA TO SEE WHAT IS GOING ON. </p><p>DAHLIN, WHO HAD JUST RETURNED FROM SWEDEN ON MONDAY, </p><p>SAID SHE INDEED PLANNED TO TALK WITH HER AMBASSADOR </p><p>ABOUT DOING THAT, PERHAPS AS EARLY AS NEXT WEEK.  HER </p><p>INITIAL THOUGHT IS TO PURSUE ACCESS AS PART OF A </p><p>POSSIBLE VISIT TO A SWEDISH BUSINESS OPERATION IN THE </p><p>AREA BUT SAID SHE MIGHT ALSO TRY TO GO THERE DIRECTLY </p><p>FOR A "TOURIST" VISIT.  SHE SAID SHE DID NOT BELIEVE </p><p>THE VIETNAMESE WILL STONEWALL THE DIPLOMATIC CORPS FOR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  00598  02 OF 02  140930Z </p><p>MUCH LONGER NOW THAT THE PRESS TRIP IS UNDERWAY.  BUT, </p><p>SHE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE HARD FOR THE VIETNAMESE TO </p><p>PERMIT A VERY WIDE ACCESS FOR DIPLOMATS TO ANY OF THE </p><p>REALLY TROUBLED AREAS. </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) COMMENT: DAHLIN\'S LONG-TERM WORK IN VIETNAM </p><p>AND HER EXCELLENT SOURCES IN THE COUNTRY MAKES HER </p><p>VIEWS A HIGHLY VALUABLE CONTRAST TO THE SELF- </p><p>INTERESTED AND INFLAMMATORY COMMENTARIES WHICH HAVE </p><p>DOMINATED THE PUBLIC MEDIA.  THERE IS STILL MUCH TO BE </p><p>LEARNED ABOUT THE UNDERLYING CAUSES AND THE NATURE OF </p><p>THE EVENTS WHICH OCCURRED IN JANUARY-FEBRUARY BUT THIS </p><p>PERSPECTIVE SHOULD BE CONSIDERED CAREFULLY BEFORE THE </p><p>USG COMMITS ITSELF TOO BROADLY TO ACCEPTING THE </p><p>ASSERTIONS OF OVERSEAS-BASED, INTEREST GROUPS. </p><p>HARTER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
