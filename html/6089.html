MFA </p><p>acknowledges reports submitted by IIPA, IACC and PhRMA, </p><p>but states that it will submit substantive comments once </p><p>it has had the opportunity to review them in greater </p><p>detail.  The MFA note acknowledges IPR enforcement </p><p>problems.  Alluding to PhRMA\'s submission, MFA maintains </p><p>that there is a need for flexible implementation of </p><p>trade commitments affecting public health. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Begin Text MFA Reply: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>No. CEGY-I 25.02.2003 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PRELIMINARY VIEWS ON "THE SPECIAL 301 REVIEW" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Since we consider protection of intellectual property as </p><p>an important tool to encourage and promote human </p><p>creativity and productivity, we aim at meeting </p><p>international standards and fulfilling international </p><p>agreements in the area of intellectual property </p><p>protection. We also make our contribution to </p><p>international cooperation initiatives. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In this context, we do our best, within the limits of </p><p>our existing capabilities and resources, in order to </p><p>adopt relevant international agreements and create an </p><p>environment to promote foreign investments where a </p><p>certain level of intellectual property protection is </p><p>ensured. However, it is not unusual to face some </p><p>difficulties about implementation and enforcement of new </p><p>legislation. Moreover, if some commercial interests are </p><p>concerned and if some people face unemployment and short- </p><p>term losses of income in a developing economy, these </p><p>difficulties are further complicated. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>So far, we have welcomed criticism brought forward by </p><p>our trade partners in the framework of our international </p><p>commitments, such as those voiced at the World Trade </p><p>Organization TRIPS Council during the review of our </p><p>legislation. In this connection, we attach utmost </p><p>importance to comments of the United States Government </p><p>and its "Special 301 Review". </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In the context of, "Special 301 Review" we have had a </p><p>satisfactory level of cooperation with the US Government </p><p>up to now and we expect this to continue. We are also </p><p>pleased with the interest of the US companies and the </p><p>concerned specialized associations in the implementation </p><p>and enforcement of intellectual property protection in </p><p>Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>After a preliminary study of the points raised by these </p><p>associations, namely IIPA, IACC and PhRMA, and their </p><p>comments mentioned in their submissions, we would like </p><p>to assure you that they will receive Turkish </p><p>Government\'s due consideration and our relevant </p><p>authorities will study them in detail with respect to </p><p>their technical aspects. We hope to submit our </p><p>substantial comments later after this study. </p><p>Nevertheless, we wish to present some preliminary </p><p>observations at this stage. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Regarding the comments of IIPA and IACC, we are also </p><p>aware of certain problems of implementation and </p><p>enforcement. Despite our known efforts to improve the </p><p>capacity and expertise of law enforcement authorities in </p><p>this field, still there are certain shortcomings. We </p><p>should also take into account the economic situation in </p><p>the aftermath of a severe financial crisis. Since, </p><p>immediate implications of enforcement of intellectual </p><p>property protection are unemployment and loss of income </p><p>for some segments of society, in some cases this issue </p><p>becomes very sensitive. As we all know, accommodation of </p><p>intellectual property protection and development issues </p><p>is a widespread matter of debate in various </p><p>international fora. We should also bear in mind that </p><p>some copyright violations concern educational materials </p><p>and this requires a special attention. Nevertheless, we </p><p>appreciate the relatively balanced approach of these two </p><p>associations and again we assure that these comments </p><p>will receive our due consideration and appropriate </p><p>measures will be taken accordingly. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>As for the comments of PhRMA, needless to say health </p><p>issues have a special dimension in the context of </p><p>international trade regulations. Public health is such </p><p>an issue that it cannot be regulated only by trade </p><p>concerns. Special considerations of governments in </p><p>health and social policies should be given due respect. </p><p>As we know, one of the most heated debates of the WTO </p><p>Doha Development Agenda Negotiations is on this very </p><p>issue and there is a growing global concern on the </p><p>relationship between public health and intellectual </p><p>property protection. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Compared with other social policy issues, health </p><p>policies have a particular significance, since in some </p><p>cases it is a question of life and death. It is not a </p><p>surprise that health issues have a priority among others </p><p>for governments. That is especially the case for </p><p>developing countries with populations more vulnerable. </p><p>Therefore, in the context of international trade, they </p><p>require flexibility more than other trade issues. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The comments of PhRMA will also receive our due </p><p>consideration and of course appropriate measures within </p><p>the limits of possibilities will be taken accordingly. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>We expect that the US Government will take into </p><p>consideration our good will on this issue prior to the </p><p>finalisation of the "Special 301 Review". </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>End Text. </p><p>Pearson </p><p></p></div>
