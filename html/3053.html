<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 HARARE 001307 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR AF SENIOR DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR CNEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/30/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, ASEC, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: TSVANGIRAI DISCUSSES ZIMBABWE\'S CHALLENGES WITH </p><p>STAFFDEL </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) HARARE 1219 B) HARARE 1151 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: political section chief Matt Harrington. </p><p>Reasons: 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai told a visiting staffdel </p><p>that the MDC was pursuing its legal challenge of the election </p><p>result, had embarked on a campaign to sensitize African </p><p>governments to the situation in Zimbabwe, and welcomed </p><p>dialogue with ZANU-PF, so long as the ruling party did not </p><p>insist on preconditions.  He gave the impression that </p><p>organized mass action remained likely but was not imminent. </p><p>The MDC leader advocated the formation of a bipartisan </p><p>national committee, perhaps based in Parliament, to ensure </p><p>fair distribution of food assistance.  His delegation </p><p>cautioned the West to handle the NEPAD/Zimbabwe linkage very </p><p>carefully --  some in the region believe Mbeki\'s advocacy of </p><p>this initiative is a sign that he has sold out to the West. </p><p>Excluding Zimbabwe from NEPAD, therefore, could ironically </p><p>strengthen Mugabe\'s hand with key players on the continent. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) HIRC staff members Malik Chaka and Pearl Alice Marsh, </p><p>accompanied by the Ambassador and political section chief, </p><p>met on May 29 with Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) </p><p>leader Morgan Tsvangirai.  Tsvangirai was joined by MDC </p><p>Members of Parliament Priscilla Misihairabwi and Trudy </p><p>Stevenson, and special advisor Gandi Mudzingwa. </p><p> </p><p>MDC\'s Next steps </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Tsvangirai noted that the staffdel was visiting </p><p>Zimbabwe at a time of deepening political, social, and </p><p>economic crisis.  The current regime\'s lack of political </p><p>legitimacy was exacerbating the country\'s other difficulties, </p><p>including  food shortages, a worsening economy, and a </p><p>collapsing health sector.  The MDC, he continued, has decided </p><p>to proceed along several fronts.  First, the party had filed </p><p>a legal challenge of the election results, although it </p><p>recognized that the judiciary has been subverted.  Second, it </p><p>had embarked on an active diplomatic campaign to sensitize </p><p>African governments to the deteriorating situation in </p><p>Zimbabwe.  Third, the party had welcomed the initiative by </p><p>Presidents Mbeki and Obasanjo to bring the MDC and ZANU-PF </p><p>together in a formal dialogue.  Tsvangirai expressed his view </p><p>that dialogue is the best option for finding a constructive </p><p>way forward, but said the ruling party was now trying to </p><p>impose all sorts of preconditions for resumption of the </p><p>talks, long after the agenda had been agreed on.  Without </p><p>elaborating, he noted that Nigerian Foreign Minister Lamido </p><p>was in town trying to reconvene this process (Note: </p><p>Tsvangirai\'s advisor Gandi Mudzingwa later told us that </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Lamido had advised the MDC he was working to convince Mugabe </p><p>to rejoin the talks.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) The MDC leader said there has been significant </p><p>pressure on the party leadership to craft a firm response to </p><p>the stolen election, as Zimbabweans are angry and do not </p><p>accept the status quo.  The party has had to work very hard </p><p>to restrain the public reaction, as the GOZ response to </p><p>demonstrations would certainly be brutal and bloody. </p><p>Tsvangirai mentioned three crises that need to be addressed </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>urgently.  First, the food shortage could lead to a </p><p>"catastrophic situation," and a bipartisan national committee </p><p>ought to be established to devise an effective solution.  In </p><p>addition, the rapid shutting down of companies was causing a </p><p>commensurate -- and alarming -- rise in unemployment and </p><p>poverty rates, and an effective policy must be implemented on </p><p>the AIDS pandemic, a national disaster that goverment had not </p><p>demonstrated the political will to address. </p><p> </p><p>MDC\'s Africa diplomacy </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Noting the MDC\'s attempts to build African support, </p><p>Marsh asked whether the West had misplayed its hand by too </p><p>strongly criticizing Mugabe and his policies in advance of </p><p>the election.  Not at all, Tsvangirai replied.  Africa, he </p><p>said, must live up to international human rights norms, and </p><p>cannot continue to insist that it be judged by lower </p><p>standards if it expects the world\'s respect.  Asked the MDC\'s </p><p>objectives in lobbying African nations, Tsvangirai said the </p><p>party\'s approach was to recognize the injustices of the </p><p>colonial past and the contributions made by the liberation </p><p>generation.  At the same time, it is pointing out that, </p><p>instead of contributing to Zimbabwe\'s prosperity, this </p><p>country\'s liberation generation is employing organized </p><p>violence to suppress the population.  Africa, he said, is at </p><p>a stage where it must deal with both sides of the political </p><p>divide, and that is how tolerance and democratic values are </p><p>nurtured.  The MDC wants an election rerun "at some point," </p><p>but wants to secure agreement on a transitional mechanism in </p><p>the meantime. </p><p> </p><p>Transitional mechanism </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Chaka inquired what a transitional mechanism would </p><p>look like, and wondered how the MDC would maintain its </p><p>independence while participating in such an arrangement.  The </p><p>MDC, Tsvangirai replied, would not follow (former ZAPU </p><p>leader) Joshua Nkomo\'s example and allow itself to be </p><p>co-opted.  The transitional mechanism (which might include a </p><p>50-50 sharing of Cabinet posts) should be tasked with laying </p><p>the groundwork for a new election, and should oversee </p><p>implementation of confidence-building measures such as </p><p>disbanding of the militias and de-politicization of the </p><p>police. </p><p> </p><p>Internal ZANU-PF dynamics </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Chaka expressed surprise that no one in ZANU-PF had </p><p>been willing to confront Mugabe about the damaging </p><p>consequences of his policies.  There are two primary groups </p><p>in the ruling party, Tsvangirai replied, the hardliners and </p><p>the reformers, and Mugabe believes he can control the destiny </p><p>of Zimbabwe using the hardliners, the most prominent of whom </p><p>is Speaker of Parliament and heir apparent Emmerson </p><p>Mnangagwa.  There are many in the ruling party who are </p><p>unhappy with the direction of the country, but they feel </p><p>vulnerable because Mugabe has, over the years, evolved from a </p><p>quasi-democrat to benign dictator to brutal dictator. </p><p> </p><p>Food crisis </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  Marsh asked what kind of national body Tsvangirai </p><p>envisioned for dealing with the looming food shortages.  War </p><p>veterans nationwide, he replied, are taking over food </p><p>distribution efforts and are denying MDC supporters access. </p><p>A bipartisan committee, perhaps based in Parliament, would </p><p>ensure that food is distributed to all who need it, </p><p>regardless of political affiliation.  The Ambassador noted </p><p>that he had urged the United Nations to establish an </p><p>independent mechanism to monitor food deliveries, and that we </p><p>and other donors would likely support such a body.  He </p><p>informed Tsvangirai that the USG would be announcing that it </p><p>had been forced to divert to Zambia, Malawi and Mozambique </p><p>10,000 metric tons of yellow maize intended for Zimbabwe </p><p>because the GOZ had refused to grant an exemption to its own </p><p>restrictions on grain with Genetically Modified Organisms </p><p>(GMO). </p><p> </p><p>Mass action </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) Chaka said he had read recent press reports quoting </p><p>Tsvangirai\'s vows to organize mass action.  What precisely </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>does the MDC leader mean by mass action, and are there large </p><p>numbers of Zimbabweans prepared to participate in it, </p><p>particularly in light of the failed stayaway shortly after </p><p>the election?  That stayaway had failed, Tsvangirai said, </p><p>because it was organized by the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade </p><p>Unions as a protest of labor conditions, not a demonstration </p><p>of unhappiness with the country\'s broader political crisis. </p><p>There is no question of numbers or capacity to organize, as </p><p>mass action will happen.  People\'s anger is deep, and they </p><p>are not prepared to countenance another six years of rule by </p><p>President Mugabe.  The MDC, however, has not yet decided what </p><p>form it will take. </p><p> </p><p>NEPAD and the West\'s approach </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C)  Marsh asked what the West could do to help </p><p>extricate Zimbabwe from its current plight.  The West\'s </p><p>approach has been constructive, Tsvangirai said, as the </p><p>efforts to isolate the GOZ leadership are having an effect, </p><p>if not on Mugabe at least on those around him.  He urged the </p><p>international community to continue to pressure and isolate </p><p>the Zimbabwean president, and to try to find a dignified exit </p><p>for him.  MP Trudy Stevenson added that it would be useful if </p><p>the G-8 makes it clear at the upcoming summit that the </p><p>continent\'s approach to Zimbabwe will affect the success of </p><p>NEPAD.  Yes, Tsvangirai agreed, there is no way that Zimbabwe </p><p>can be walled off from the benefits of NEPAD, as if it\'s an </p><p>island.  If they are to have any credibility, African </p><p>governments must be able to demonstrate that they can police </p><p>themselves effectively.  MP Priscilla Misihairabwi warned </p><p>that the West must be very careful in how it handles the </p><p>NEPAD/Zimbabwe linkage.  Some in the region, she said, are </p><p>deeply suspicious of NEPAD and believe the initiative </p><p>indicates Mbeki has sold out to the West, so excluding </p><p>Zimbabwe could very well strengthen Mugabe\'s hand in his </p><p>attempts to portray himself as the preeminent defender of the </p><p>continent\'s interests.  The Ambassador pointed out that, </p><p>although he expected positive statements to be made about </p><p>NEPAD at the G-8 meeting, no checks would be written, and </p><p>there will be plenty of opportunities to shape NEPAD down the </p><p>road. </p><p> </p><p>Continuing Harassment </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) The Ambassador asked Tsvangirai to comment on press </p><p>reports that police had raided his rural home the night of </p><p>May 26.  According to the MDC leader, a group of heavily </p><p>armed police had entered his home without a warrant in </p><p>Buhera, Manicaland province, saying they were searching for </p><p>arms of war.  They beat up one of the home\'s caretakers and </p><p>proceeded to arrest 13 MDC supporters in the vicinity, even </p><p>though they had not committed any apparent crime.  Tsvangirai </p><p>expressed relief that his mother, who lives in the house, had </p><p>been elsewhere at the time. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) Tsvangirai was upbeat but did not present a </p><p>particularly focused picture of his party\'s plans in the </p><p>near-term.  In fact, he concentrated more on describing the </p><p>range of challenges facing Zimbabwe than on proposing </p><p>achievable cures.  Such vagueness likely derives from the </p><p>reality that there is not agreement among senior members of </p><p>the party about the way forward.  Tsvangirai\'s failure in his </p><p>introductory remarks to mention mass action likely indicates </p><p>that such a step has been put on the back burner for now. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
