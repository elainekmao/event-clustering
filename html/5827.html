<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 001100 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, P, EB AND EUR/SE </p><p>TREASURY FOR U/S TAYLOR AND OASIA - MILLS AND LEICHTER </p><p>STATE PASS USTR - NOVELLI AND MOWERY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY\'S ECONOMY: MARKET AND IMF UPDATE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but unclassified, and not for internet </p><p>distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary: Turkish markets remain hopeful that the </p><p>GOT will respond positively to the USG by the weekend, though </p><p>Deputy PM Sener\'s late afternoon press statement of "no </p><p>agreement yet" sparked some selling.  IMF mission staff in </p><p>Ankara are less hopeful of reaching agreement on the 2003 </p><p>budget primary surplus, following a late February 18 meeting </p><p>with State Minister Babacan.  We include for the curious a </p><p>spring calender of Turkey\'s debt redemptions.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Markets Stable But Uneasy, Some Profit-Taking </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) On February 19, Turkish financial markets were </p><p>basically stable, in high trading volumes, with some </p><p>profit-taking after the market rallies of the past two days. </p><p>The lira ended the day unchanged from yesterday\'s close at TL </p><p>1,626,000 to the dollar; T-bill rates inched downward to 56.5 </p><p>percent (from 57 yesterday); the Istanbul Stock Exchange was </p><p>down 1.5 percent. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) There was some selling (hedge fund clients of </p><p>Deutsche Bank we understand) following Deputy PM Sener\'s late </p><p>afternoon press statement, coming out of the Cabinet meeting, </p><p>that there was no agreement yet on the U.S. troop deployment. </p><p> But the predominant sentiment remains positive about the </p><p>prospects of a deal.  JP Morgan/Chase bond trader summed up </p><p>the market expectation as a positive GOT response to the U.S. </p><p>before the weekend. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) CEO of Akbank Zafer Kurtul sounded one cautionary </p><p>note:  he told us that the GOT needs to clear up its U.S. </p><p>package negotiations  before the next large T-bill auction on </p><p>March 3.  If not, there will be a major "market disruption" </p><p>he predicted.  (Note:  Akbank is Turkey\'s largest private </p><p>sector commercial bank, and the largest holder of T-bills.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Spring Debt Redemption Calendar:  Beware March 5 </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Turkish Treasury deputy DG for public finance </p><p>Volkan Taskin provided us the following domestic debt </p><p>redemption calendar.  For the remainder of February, there is </p><p>only a TL 394 (about $238 million) domestic debt redemption </p><p>to state banks on February 26; Taskin said the Treasury may </p><p>hold a small auction on February 25, or may not, depending on </p><p>market conditions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Date   Payment to        Payment to public sector </p><p>       Market             (Cenbank/state banks/etc) </p><p>----  --------------      ------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3/5    TL 3.8 quad        TL 100 trillion </p><p>3/12   -                  TL 511 trillion </p><p>3/15   -                  TL 9 trillion </p><p>3/19   TL 4.5 quad        TL 500 trillion </p><p>3/24   -                  TL 25.8 trillion </p><p>3/26   -                  TL 339 trillion </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>March total:  TL 9.8 quadrillion ($6 billion) in domestic </p><p>debt service; $0.8 billion in external debt service. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4/9    TL 4.6 quad        TL 600 trillion </p><p>4/24   TL 1.6 quad </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>April total: TL 7.8 quadrillion ($4.4 billion) in domestic </p><p>debt service;  $0.5 billion in external debt service. </p><p>Smaller redemption dates in April not given. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5/7    TL 4.2 quad        TL 200 trillion </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5/10   -                  TL 2.8 quadrillion </p><p>                          (payment to CenBank) </p><p>5/14   TL 1.2 quad        TL 1.2 quad </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5/21   TL 3.6 quad        TL 100 trillion </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>May total:  TL 13 quadrillion ($7.4 billion) in domestic debt </p><p>service; $1 billion in external debt service. Smaller </p><p>redemption dates in May not given. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) Taskin\'s comment to us echoed that of Akbank CEO </p><p>above:  the GOT must provide clarity to the markets before </p><p>the March 5 redemption date.  Taskin said good press </p><p>announcements on both the U.S. package and the IMF program </p><p>would be enough.  In that positive scenario, he saw no need </p><p>for a bridge loan.  In the absence of this positive scenario </p><p>(i.e., no U.S. package or IMF program annoucement) Taskin </p><p>said Treasury would work with local banks to try to ensure </p><p>high debt roll-over rates for as long as possible.  In this </p><p>case he predicted March 4 auction rates in the 65-70 percent </p><p>range.  (Comment: Given the average maturity of </p><p>TL-denominated T-bills of about 8 months, this means a much </p><p>higher debt service in late 2003 than projected.  It would </p><p>immediately reignite concerns of debt sustainability.   End </p><p>Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>IMF Less Hopeful </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) IMF resrep reported Feburary 19 that the late </p><p>February 18 meeting with State Minister Babacan had not gone </p><p>well.  Treasury U/S Oztrak had met with PM Gul on February </p><p>14, and then reported to the IMF team GOT agreement on </p><p>several 2003 budget issues.  On February 18 Babacan appeared </p><p>to step back from this agreement. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  The draft LOI had included a GOT commitment not to </p><p>undertake new amnesties or re-schedulings of back taxes or </p><p>other public receivables (e.g., employer\'s social security </p><p>premiums, state bank loans, electricity arrearages, all of </p><p>which AK figures have publicly mentioned).   PM Gul </p><p>reportedly agreed with Oztrak to this commitment, but Babacan </p><p>explicitly told the IMF team that he couldn\'t agree. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Babacan said there would be no new fiscal saving </p><p>measures, though the primary surplus shortfall is, per the </p><p>IMF calculations, now 1. 7 percent of GNP or about TL 6 </p><p>quadrillion (about $3.8 billion).  Oztrak had indicated that </p><p>Gul was committed to taking measures needed to close this </p><p>shortfall. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) Comment:  IMF/GOT negotiations on the 2003 budget </p><p>are ongoing, and will likely continue up to the last minute </p><p>before the GOT submits the budget to its parliament.  Though </p><p>GOT staff are pushing for a budget submission this week, the </p><p>interim budget goes through end March.  GOT staff appear to </p><p>be pushing becuase of the fragility of market sentiment.  But </p><p>even if IMF staff and the GOT reach agreement on the 2003 </p><p>budget, IMF staff told us they will not recommend a Fourth </p><p>Review board date, given the long list of outstanding </p><p>structural reform conditions.  Full update septel. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
