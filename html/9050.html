<p>UNCLAS AMMAN 003891 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>TREASURY FOR OFAC FOR DAVID MILLS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETTC, MOPS, PREL, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDAN-BASED COMPANY WORRIED ABOUT IRAQI SUBSIDIARY </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) AMMAN 2509 B) AMMAN 2374 </p><p> </p><p> SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED; NOT FOR INTERNET DISTRIBUTION </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Dr. Muwaffak Haddadin, Director General, Arab </p><p>Company for Drug Industries and Medical Appliances (ACDIMA) </p><p>met with Econoff June 29 to express concern regarding </p><p>ACDIMA\'s Iraq-based subsidiary Arab Company for Antibiotics </p><p>Industries (ACAI).  Haddadin said he was concerned about the </p><p>security of the plant, which is 25 kilometers southeast of </p><p>Baghdad, and the safety of its employees.  ACAI is a producer </p><p>of antibiotics and other pharmaceuticals. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Haddadin said that, as of last week, the factory </p><p>had yet to sustain any damage, either during the war itself </p><p>or since the end of the war in April.  But he said that there </p><p>was an increased presence of local militias and possible </p><p>looters, threatening the day-to-day operation of the plant. </p><p>Haddadin noted that the plant, which had been inspected by </p><p>UNMOVIC in December 2002, contained a number of potentially </p><p>dual-use components, including an autoclave and injection </p><p>equipment.  That being the case, he suggested that it would </p><p>be in American interests to find a way to protect the </p><p>factory, possibly with "a tank or some military presence." </p><p>Haddadin said he would send us a map with the location of the </p><p>factory. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Haddadin also asked Econoff if the Embassy had </p><p>received a response to his request for a license to unblock </p><p>funds frozen pursuant to U.S. sanctions against Iraq (REF A). </p><p> Econoff responded in the negative, but told Haddadin Post </p><p>would follow up. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
