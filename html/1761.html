<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 001380 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/18/2006 </p><p>TAGS: EAIR, CVIS, PGOV, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: VISA FRAUD ON LAGOS/NYC FLIGHT--MEETINGS </p><p>WITH MINISTERS OF AVIATION AND INTERNAL AFFAIRS </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter; reasons 1.5 (b) and </p><p>(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U)  Summary.  Ambassador Jeter met with Aviation Minister </p><p>Kema Chikwe and Minister of Internal Affairs Afolabi during </p><p>the week of June 11 to discuss the problem of fraudulent U.S. </p><p>visas and other travel documentation on the direct Lagos-New </p><p>York flight, and to discuss solutions.  The Ambassador </p><p>informed the Ministers that the INS was willing to send a few </p><p>of its officers back to Nigeria to assist Nigerian </p><p>immigration and airline officials in detecting fraudulent </p><p>travel documents, including visas, and to train immigration </p><p>officers in fraud-detection.  Both Ministers responded </p><p>favorably to the proposal, and expressed concern over the </p><p>potential impact high turnaround rates might have on the </p><p>long-term economic viability of this and future direct </p><p>U.S.-Nigeria flights.  While jurisdiction over this issue is </p><p>shared between Aviation and Internal Affairs, both Ministers </p><p>expressed a desire to address this problem in an expeditious </p><p>manner.  The Ambassador promised to send a draft MOU from INS </p><p>that could serve as the starting point for negotiations for </p><p>an INS presence at Lagos\' Murtalla Mohammed Airport.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U)  In a June 11 meeting, Ambassador Jeter congratulated </p><p>Minister of Aviation Kema Chikwe on the progress made in </p><p>civil aviation during her tenure.  Chikwe said that Virgin </p><p>Air would soon commence flights into Abuja and Lagos that </p><p>would compete with British Air, and hopefully compel BA to </p><p>offer better onboard and other services.  Ambassador Jeter </p><p>addressed the high turnaround rate for fraudulent visas on </p><p>the South African Airways (SAA)/Nigerian Airways (NA) flight </p><p>from Lagos to New York.  He said that the fines paid by the </p><p>airlines were very substantial (over a quarter of a million </p><p>dollars) and threatened the profitability of the route, but </p><p>more importantly might scare off other competitors interested </p><p>in beginning direct Nigeria-U.S. flights.  Chikwe responded </p><p>that this development was disturbing.  The Ambassador </p><p>recalled that informal assistance had been provided by INS </p><p>agents at the Lagos Airport after the commencement of the </p><p>flight, and at that point there were no significant problems </p><p>with visa fraud.  Ambassador Jeter told the Minster that the </p><p>USG was willing to send an INS team back to Nigeria to train </p><p>Nigerian immigration officers to better detect fraudulent </p><p>visas and other documentation.  Chikwe said that such </p><p>training would be helpful, and should be done in a timely </p><p>fashion.  She asked the Ambassador to send her a letter </p><p>formally describing the proposal, to include a draft MOU, and </p><p>said she would work with Minister of Internal Affairs Afolabi </p><p>to get the MOU signed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U)  On privitization, the Ambassador asked Chikwe her </p><p>position on the proposed sale of Nigeria Airways.  She </p><p>described the three options proposed by the Bureau of </p><p>Privitization of Enterprises\' (BPE) guidelines for selling </p><p>Nigeria Airways as turn-around, liquidation and creating a </p><p>new competing option.  She said that turning Nigeria Airways </p><p>around prior to sale was currently the consensus option, but </p><p>complaind that the International Finance Corporation\'s (IFC) </p><p>condition-- a five year monopoly on most routes--was onerous, </p><p>and would harm the Nigerian consumer.  She added that the IFC </p><p>blamed the Ministry for having signed the Open Skies </p><p>Agreement, which she said would ultimately benefit the </p><p>Nigerian travelling public.  Chikwe said that the EX-IM Bank </p><p>loan facility of USD 30 million for the repair of Nigeria </p><p>Airways\' (NA) decrepit aircraft would go a long way toward </p><p>"beautifying" NA prior to sale.  Chikwe also said that she </p><p>was in favor of dual-designation of routes as a means of </p><p>encouraging short-term growth in air traffic, and creating </p><p>income for NA.  In that context, she mentioned that Virgin </p><p>Air would soon be flying into Abuja from London.  "British </p><p>Air cannot hold this country to ransom any longer," Chikwe </p><p>said. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U)  On June 13, Ambassador Jeter met with Minister Sunday </p><p>Afolabi and his staff to discuss the SAA/NA visa fraud </p><p>problem.  After Afolabi read a letter from the Ambassador </p><p>that had been sent to him in April on this subject, (a letter </p><p>he claimed he had never received), he commented on the </p><p>seriousness of the problem.  The Ambassador said that during </p><p>the first month of the flight, there were no fraudlent </p><p>documents, but that since then the rate had increased </p><p>alarmingly, and threatened the commercial viability of the </p><p>SAA/NA flight.  Ibrahim Jarma, Comptroller General of the </p><p>Prisons Service, commented that the Immigration team at the </p><p>Murtalla Mohammed received an award for their excellent work </p><p>in catching fraudulent visas, but the team was later split up </p><p>and assigned to other duties.  Ambassador again said tha INS </p><p>was willing to send a team back to Nigeria to assist in </p><p>screening passengers and to train Nigerian officials, but </p><p>added that a MOU would have to be signed by all parties. </p><p>Afolabi said that Chikwe would take the lead on this since it </p><p>fell within her Ministry\'s jurisdiction, but agreed to work </p><p>with her and other GON Ministries to get the MOU signed. </p><p>Poloff asked whether it would be possible as an interim </p><p>measure to re-unite the original team of officers that were </p><p>trained by the INS to work the flight pending the conclusion </p><p>of a MOU. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  Comment:  Both the Ministers of Aviation and Internal </p><p>Affairs seemed to recognize the importance of addressing this </p><p>issue before Nigeria develops a reputation with foreign </p><p>immigration agencies and air carriers for incompetence in </p><p>weeding out fraudulent visas.  While Chikwe and Afolabi both </p><p>appear prepared to take action, getting from "yes" to a </p><p>signature can be a fairly torturous process.  In a separate </p><p>meeting with the Secretary to Government for the Federation </p><p>(SGF) Ufot Ekaette (septel), the Ambassador also raised the </p><p>issue of getting a MOU signed by both Aviation and Internal </p><p>Affairs so that INS officers could be re-deployed as soon as </p><p>possible.  The SGF asked for a copy of the Ambassador\'s </p><p>letter to Afolabi, and said he would assist in bringing the </p><p>process to a conclusion in case it were to stall.  We are </p><p>complying with that request. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C)  Chikwe\'s comments regarding privatization are </p><p>interesting in light of her reputation as one of the most </p><p>corrupt Ministers in the Obasanjo Administration. </p><p>Reportedly, Chikwe exercises her regulatory control over the </p><p>airline industry in such a way as to obtain maximum pecuniary </p><p>benefit to herself.  Little wonder that she would oppose the </p><p>IFC\'s five-year monopoly of routes by Nigeria Airways--she </p><p>would lose access to the foreign air carriers who apparently </p><p>feather her nest.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
