<p>S E C R E T OTTAWA 001252 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/02/2013 </p><p>TAGS: MARR, MOPS, PREL, XG, XH, IZ, CA, Iraq </p><p>SUBJECT: CANADIAN RESPONSE ON FLEEING IRAQI REGIME OFFICIALS </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) STATE 98747 (B) STATE 102827 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Minister Counselor Brian Flora, </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>SEE ACTION REQUEST PARA 2. </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) In response to reftel requests, the Canadian </p><p>Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade (DFAIT) </p><p>provided us the following response on April 29: </p><p> </p><p>"The issue of apprehending and dealing appropriately with </p><p>persons who have allegedly committed crimes against humanity </p><p>or war crimes requires international cooperation and </p><p>multilateral approaches. </p><p> </p><p>The policy of the Canadian Government is unequivocal.  Canada </p><p>is not and will not become a safe haven for foreign nationals </p><p>who have committed war crimes, crimes against humanity or </p><p>other reprehensible acts regardless of when or where they </p><p>were committed.  One of the purposes of the Canada\'s Crimes </p><p>Against Humanity and War Crimes Program is to ensure that </p><p>Canada complies with its international obligations.  This </p><p>includes the investigation, prosecution and extradition or </p><p>surrender of alleged war criminals, as well as cooperation </p><p>with international tribunals.  Extradition to a foreign </p><p>government or surrender to an international tribunal may </p><p>occur upon request in accordance with Canadian law. </p><p> </p><p>Also, the provisions contained in Canada\'s Crimes Against </p><p>Humanity and War Crimes Act govern criminal prosecutions in </p><p>Canada.  The Crimes Against Humanity and War Crimes Act </p><p>provides for the prosecution of individuals present in Canada </p><p>for any offense stated in the Act regardless of where the </p><p>offense occurred.  For crimes committed outside Canada, the </p><p>Act may be applied retroactively. </p><p> </p><p>In terms of administrative remedies, the Immigration and </p><p>Refugee Protection Act provides grounds of inadmissibility to </p><p>Canada for persons alleged to have committed war crimes and </p><p>crimes against humanity.  The Act renders inadmissible senior </p><p>officials of regimes which have been designated by the </p><p>Minister of Citizenship and Immigration as being involved in </p><p>terrorism, systematic or gross human rights violations or </p><p>crimes against humanity.  The governments of Iraq under Ahmed </p><p>Hassan Al-Bakr and Saddam Hussein have been so designated. </p><p>The individuals named in your demarche would appear to be </p><p>subject to the provisions of this designation.  Individuals </p><p>who pose a danger to the public of Canada will be detained </p><p>under the Immigration Act. </p><p> </p><p>The Department of Citizenship and Immigration (CIC) liaises </p><p>closely with our international partners and is currently </p><p>aware of over 300 Iraqi officials who are inadmissible to </p><p>Canada.  Overseas missions, ports of entries and offices in </p><p>Canada are on the alert for officials form the listed Iraqi </p><p>regimes.  Furthermore, information-sharing agreements between </p><p>Canada and the US allow for the exchange of information with </p><p>the Department of Homeland Security and the Consular Affairs </p><p>Branch at the US State Department." </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) ACTION REQUEST: DFAIT officials subsequently informed </p><p>us that all of the Iraqi officials listed in reftel B are </p><p>inadmissable to Canada.  They asked if this list can be </p><p>declassified so that CIC headquarters can it with their </p><p>immigration officials worldwide.  Please advise. </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
