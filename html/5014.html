<p>UNCLAS GUATEMALA 000055 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR WHA/CEN, ALSO FOR D/HS, HOMELAND SECURITY GROUP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PTER, CVIS, PREL, PGOV, APER, SNAR, GT </p><p>SUBJECT: ESTABLISHMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY WORKING GROUP </p><p> </p><p>REF: 02 STATE 263389 </p><p> </p><p>1. Embassy Guatemala has established a Homeland Security </p><p>Working Group (HSWG) comprising all the agencies at Post with </p><p>law enforcement or security responsibilities, as well as </p><p>appropriate Mission section heads.  The HSWG will ensure Post </p><p>is able to coordinate its resources to provide Mission-wide </p><p>support for "Homeland Security Abroad" initiatives.  The HSWG </p><p>will meet every other week, or as needed, to implement </p><p>instructions from Washington and to follow up on initiatives </p><p>generated at post.  The HSWG will be chaired by the DCM, and </p><p>the Political Section will serve as coordinator. </p><p> </p><p>2. The HSWG will work in close coordination with the EAC and </p><p>other standing committees responsible for transnational crime </p><p>issues, but will not replace those committees.  The Rule of </p><p>Law Committee, the Visas Viper Committee, and the Narcotics </p><p>and Corruption Committee will address issues that arise in </p><p>their particular areas of responsibility, but that do not </p><p>specifically involve threats to homeland security. The EAC </p><p>will continue functioning normally, and will be able to </p><p>invoke the HSWG if it determines the emergency it is </p><p>addressing also involves a threat to homeland security. </p><p> </p><p>3.  In the immediate aftermath of the September 11 attacks, </p><p>post set up a similar working group to coordinate </p><p>Mission-wide responses to terrorism, with good results.  The </p><p>Counter-Terrorism Working Group proved to be both responsive </p><p>to Washington and adaptable to changing local conditions. </p><p>The Homeland Security Working Group will make that function </p><p>permanent. </p><p>Hamilton </p><p></p></div>
