<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 CAIRO 011981 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR LEAF </p><p>LONDON FOR TUELLER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL: 11/09/07 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, KISL, PHUM, PINR, EG </p><p>SUBJECT: EGYPT\'S MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD - DOWN BUT NOT OUT </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) CLASSIFIED BY POL/ECON MINISTER COUNSELOR </p><p>JEFF MILLINGTON FOR REASON 1.5 (D). </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD AND JOURNALIST SYNDICATE </p><p>MEMBERS MUHAMMAD ABD AL-QUDUS AND SALAH ABD AL-MAQSUD </p><p>TOLD US RECENTLY THAT: </p><p> </p><p>--  THE LATEST MOVE IN THE GOVERNMENT\'S ONGOING </p><p>CAMPAIGN TO SUPPRESS THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD (MB) WAS </p><p>THE ARRESTS IN AUGUST AND SEPTEMBER OF DOZENS OF MB </p><p>STUDENT ACTIVISTS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.  THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S INTENT WAS TO DETER ISLAMIC ACTIVISM ON </p><p>CAMPUSES PRIOR TO THE ACADEMIC YEAR. </p><p> </p><p>--  THE MB WILL CONTINUE WITHIN THE JOURNALISTS </p><p>SYNDICATE AND ELSEWHERE TO OPPOSE THOSE EGYPTIANS WHO </p><p>ADVOCATE GREATER PEOPLE-TO-PEOPLE TIES WITH ISRAEL. </p><p> </p><p>--  EGYPT\'S MB REMAINS IN CLOSE CONTACT WITH OFFICIALLY </p><p>RECOGNIZED MB POLITICAL PARTIES IN JORDAN, YEMEN AND </p><p>ALGERIA. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) THE GOVERNMENT\'S CONTINUING ARRESTS AND </p><p>DETENTIONS OF MB MEMBERS HAS PUT THE ORGANIZATION, </p><p>WHICH REMAINS ILLEGAL HERE, ON THE DEFENSIVE.  ITS </p><p>LEAFLETS DECRY THE DETENTIONS WITHOUT TRIAL, AND SEEK </p><p>OTHER OPPOSITION GROUPS\' SUPPORT AGAINST THESE ABUSES </p><p>OF POLITICAL FREEDOMS.  DESPITE ITS CURRENT WEAKNESS, </p><p>HOWEVER, THE MB HAS ROOTS IN EGYPT AT ALL LEVELS OF </p><p>SOCIETY AND A DEMONSTRATED CAPACITY TO SURVIVE </p><p>GOVERNMENT CRACK-DOWNS. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) EMBOFF MET SEPARATELY WITH MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD </p><p>LEADERS SALAH ABD AL-MAQSUD AND MUHAMMAD ABD AL-QUDUS </p><p>NOVEMBER 6 AND 9.   BOTH ARE PROMINENT JOURNALISTS WHO </p><p>WERE ELECTED TO THE 12-MEMBER BOARD OF THE JOURNALISTS </p><p>SYNDICATE AND WRITE EDITORIALS FOR THE ISLAMIC </p><p>OPPOSITION PRESS (MAINLY THE TWICE WEEKLY "AL-SHAAB" OF </p><p>THE ISLAMIC SOCIALIST LABOR PARTY, AND THE WEEKLY </p><p>"AL-HAQIQAH" OF THE ISLAMIC-ORIENTED LIBERAL PARTY). </p><p>BOTH HAVE SERVED PRISON TIME FOR THEIR MEMBERSHIP IN </p><p>THE MB, WHICH IS AN ILLEGAL ORGANIZATION IN EGYPT. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>PERCEIVED U.S. ANTI-MUSLIM BIAS </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) ABD AL-QUDUS FOCUSED ON WHAT IS PERCEIVED IN </p><p>THE EGYPTIAN STREET AS A BIAS IN U.S. POLICY TOWARDS </p><p>ISRAEL AND AGAINST MUSLIMS.  PRESSURING ARAB STATES TO </p><p>ATTEND DOHA WAS ONE INDICATION, PER ABD AL-QUDUS.  HE </p><p>UNDERSTOOD IN THEORY THE ECONOMIC BENEFIT TO THE ARABS </p><p>OF DOHA BUT REMAINED ADAMANTLY OPPOSED TO IT.  IF THE </p><p>EGYPTIAN GOVERNMENT ATTENDED DOHA, THE EGYPTIANS IN THE </p><p>STREET WOULD BE ANGRY, HE PREDICTED.  ANOTHER </p><p>INDICATION IS THE APPOINTMENT OF AMERICAN JEWS TO </p><p>POLICY-MAKING JOBS IN THE MIDDLE EAST.  EMBOFF ASKED </p><p>HIM NOT TO PREJUDGE PERSONS BASED ON THEIR RELIGIOUS </p><p>BACKGROUNDS, BUT TO FOCUS ON SPECIFIC DIFFERENCES WITH </p><p>U.S. POLICY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p>GOVERNMENT CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  BOTH MB MEMBERS COMPLAINED ABOUT CONTINUING </p><p>GOVERNMENT PRESSURE ON THE PROFESSIONAL SYNDICATES. </p><p>TWO YEARS AGO, FOLLOWING THE ELECTORAL SUCCESSES OF MB </p><p>AND OTHER ISLAMIC-ORIENTED LEADERS IN THE SYNDICATES, </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT TOOK STEPS TO SHUT THEM DOWN.  ONLY THE </p><p>JOURNALISTS SYNDICATE IS CURRENTLY OPERATING UNDER ITS </p><p>ELECTED BOARD.   (NOTE:  LAWYERS HAVE TOLD US THEY </p><p>EXPECT NEW ELECTIONS FOR THEIR SYNDICATE IN NEXT </p><p>APRIL).  THE JOURNALISTS SYNDICATE, ELECTED FAIRLY PER </p><p>ABD AL-MAQSUD IN 1995, IS COMPOSED OF 2 MB MEMBERS, ONE </p><p>EACH FROM THE NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY, NASSERIST, </p><p>WAFD AND SOCIALIST TAGAMMU PARTIES, AND SIX </p><p>INDEPENDENTS AMONG WHOM ARE SEVERAL ISLAMIC-ORIENTED </p><p>WRITERS. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) ABD AL-MAQSUD DESCRIBED THE GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE MB:  IT STARTED IN EARLY 1995 WITH </p><p>A SERIES OF ARRESTS AGAINST MB LEADERS IN THE </p><p>SYNDICATES, LEADING TO A NOVEMBER 1995 MILITARY COURT </p><p>JUDGMENT AGAINST 54 MB LEADERS.  THEY RECEIVED PRISON </p><p>SENTENCES RANGING FROM THREE TO FIVE YEARS.  THE MAIN </p><p>CHARGE - THAT THEY WERE PLOTTING THE OVERTHROW OF THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT -- IS COMPLETELY FALSE, PER ABD AL-MAQSUD. </p><p>THE MB BELIEVES IN BALLOT BOXES NOT VIOLENCE, HE </p><p>STRESSED. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) THE GOVERNMENT SYSTEMATICALLY PREVENTS MB </p><p>PARTICIPATION IN ELECTIONS, ACCORDING TO ABD AL-MAQSUD. </p><p>IN THE 1995 PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS, 170 MB MEMBERS </p><p>WERE CANDIDATES BUT NOT ONE WAS ELECTED OWING TO FRAUD, </p><p>HE SAID.  IN THE APRIL 1997 LOCAL GOVERNMENT ELECTIONS, </p><p>AGAIN NOT ONE MB CANDIDATE WON.  THE GOVERNMENT USED </p><p>PRESSURE TACTICS, INCLUDING ARRESTS AND DETENTIONS, TO </p><p>FORCE MANY MB CANDIDATES TO WITHDRAW.  FINALLY, THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT HAS ALREADY COOKED THE RESULTS OF NEXT </p><p>MONTH\'S NATION-WIDE UNIVERSITY STUDENT UNION ELECTIONS, </p><p>ABOLISHING LISTS OF CANDIDATES WITH ISLAMIC LEADERS AND </p><p>FORCING OTHERS TO WITHDRAW THEIR NAMES.  33 STUDENTS OF </p><p>ALEXANDRIA UNIVERSITY WERE ARRESTED FOR BEING MB </p><p>MEMBERS IN AUGUST, AND ANOTHER GROUP WAS ARRESTED IN </p><p>SEPTEMBER PRIOR TO THE OPENING OF THE ACADEMIC YEAR, IN </p><p>ORDER TO DETER ISLAMIC POLITICAL ACTIVITY ON CAMPUS. </p><p>BOTH ABD AL-MAQSUD AND ABD AL-QUDUS SAID THAT NINE OF </p><p>THE STUDENTS ARRESTED IN ALEXANDRIA WERE TORTURED IN </p><p>PRISON (ABD-AL-QUDUS SHOWED EMBOFF A PAMPHLET ON THE </p><p>ALLEGED TORTURE OF THESE STUDENTS, WHO HAVE SINCE BEEN </p><p>RELEASED). </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) ABD AL-QUDUS SAID HE HAD HELPED FOUND IN 1996 </p><p>"THE COMMITTEE TO DEFEND PRISONERS OF CONSCIENCE" </p><p>COMPOSED OF DIVERSE OPPOSITION FIGURES FROM THE MB, </p><p>SOCIALISTS, NASSERISTS AND WAFDISTS.   THE COMMITTEE, </p><p>WHOSE HONORARY CHAIRMAN IS NOBEL PRIZE WINNER NAGUIB </p><p>MAHFOUZ, DISTINGUISHES BETWEEN CONVICTED TERRORISTS </p><p>FROM THE IG, WHOM IT DOES NOT HELP, AND PERSONS </p><p>DETAINED UNDER MARTIAL LAW WITHOUT A CRIMINAL </p><p>CONVICTION.  THE LATTER NUMBER OVER 20,000 PER </p><p>ABD AL-QUDUS.  (COMMENT:  THIS IS UNDOUBTEDLY AN </p><p>EXAGGERATED NUMBER, THOUGH THE NUMBER OF DETAINEES IS </p><p>DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE.  HUMAN RIGHTS GROUPS ESTIMATE A </p><p>TOTAL PRISON POPULATION OF 32,000 INCLUDING THOSE </p><p>SERVING SENTENCES AND THOSE BEING HELD PENDING TRIALS </p><p>AND SENTENCES.  END COMMENT).  LEAFLETS PRINTED BY THE </p><p>COMMITTEE EMPHASIZE ITS BROAD BASE OF OPPOSITION </p><p>SUPPORT, AND LIST DETAINEES WHO REMAIN IN PRISON </p><p>WITHOUT TRIAL. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD CAMPAIGNS AGAINST THE PRO-PEACE </p><p>CAMP AND WASAT PARTY (BUT NOT THE COPTS) </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) EMBOFF ASKED BOTH MB LEADERS ABOUT THEIR </p><p>POSITION, AS ADVOCATES OF GREATER POLITICAL FREEDOMS, </p><p>ON THE ATTEMPT OF THE JOURNALISTS\' SYNDICATE TO </p><p>DISCIPLINE SYNDICATE MEMBERS LUTFI AL-KHOLI AND OTHERS </p><p>FOR ADVOCATING GREATER NORMALIZATION WITH ISRAEL. </p><p>ISN\'T THIS CONTRARY TO THE RIGHT TO FREEDOM OF </p><p>EXPRESSION?  BOTH SAID THIS WAS NOT A FREEDOM OF </p><p>EXPRESSION ISSUE BUT RATHER A QUESTION OF ADHERENCE TO </p><p>A SYNDICATE GENERAL ASSEMBLY DECISION IN 1980 TO FORBID </p><p>NORMALIZATION PRIOR TO A COMPLETE PEACE TREATY WITH ALL </p><p>ARAB PARTIES. (NOTE:  AL-AHRAM WRITER LUTFI AL-KHOLI IS </p><p>CONTESTING THIS SYNDICATE DECISION IN COURT FOR BEING </p><p>CONTRARY TO THE EGYPTIAN CONSTITUTION\'S GUARANTEE OF </p><p>FREEDOM OF SPEECH.) </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) EMBOFF ALSO ASKED ABOUT THE MB\'S APPARENT </p><p>OPPOSITION TO THE ATTEMPT TO ESTABLISH A NEW POLITICAL </p><p>PARTY ON ISLAMIC PRINCIPLES CALLED AL-WASAT (THE </p><p>"MIDDLE"). ABD AL-MAQSUD SAID HE AND HIS WIFE HAD BEEN </p><p>AMONG THE ORIGINAL 71 FOUNDERS OF AL-WASAT BUT WITHDREW </p><p>FOLLOWING THE MB LEADERSHIP\'S DECISION THAT THE MOMENT </p><p>WAS NOT RIGHT FOR A POLITICAL PARTY.  HOW CAN WE HAVE A </p><p>PARTY WHEN THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT EVEN ALLOW US TO </p><p>PUBLISH A NEWSPAPER, HE ASKED.  HE MINIMIZED THE </p><p>IMPORTANCE OF THE FORMER MB MEMBERS WHO CONTINUE TO </p><p>PURSUE THIS NEW PARTY. </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) ON THE ANTI-COPT STATEMENTS MADE BY MB SUPREME </p><p>GUIDE MUSTAFA MASHOUR IN AN AL-AHRAM INTERVIEW LAST </p><p>APRIL, ABD AL-MAQSUD DENIED THAT THIS WAS MB POLICY OR </p><p>PRACTICE.  THERE WERE THREE COPTS IN THE MB LEADERSHIP </p><p>AFTER WORLD WAR II, HE CLAIMED.  HE HIMSELF USED TO </p><p>HAVE A COPT ROOMMATE AND HIS GREATEST ALLY IN THE </p><p>JOURNALISTS SYNDICATE BOARD ELECTIONS WAS A COPT.  THE </p><p>MB CONSIDERS COPTS EQUAL MEMBERS OF EGYPTIAN SOCIETY, </p><p>HE INSISTED. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>EGYPT MB TIES WITH COUNTERPARTS IN JORDAN, </p><p>YEMEN AND ALGERIA </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) ABD AL-MAQSUD NOTED THAT IN THREE COUNTRIES </p><p>MUSLIM BROTHER GROUPS ARE LEGAL POLITICAL PARTIES:  THE </p><p>ISLAMIC ACTION FRONT IN JORDAN; THE REFORM ("ISLAH") </p><p>PARTY IN YEMEN, WHICH USED TO BE IN THE GOVERNING </p><p>COALITION; AND THE MOVEMENT FOR A PEACEFUL SOCIETY </p><p>("HAMAS") IN ALGERIA, WHICH CONTROLS FIVE GOVERNMENT </p><p>MINISTRIES.  EGYPT\'S MB IS IN CLOSE CONTACT WITH EACH </p><p>OF THESE PARTIES, HE SAID.  (NOTE:  ABD AL-MUNEIM SAID, </p><p>DIRECTOR OF AL-AHRAM CENTER, TOLD US THAT MAQSUD HOSTED </p><p>A DELEGATION FROM ALGERIA\'S HAMAS TO EGYPT FOR THE </p><p>INTER-PARLIAMENTARY UNION MEETING HERE IN SEPTEMBER). </p><p>OTHER LEGITIMATE ISLAMIC PARTIES IN TURKEY (REFAH) AND </p><p>IN PAKISTAN ARE NOT MB AFFILIATES BUT DO MAINTAIN TIES </p><p>WITH THE MB IN EGYPT, HE SAID. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C) THE EFFORTS OF ABD AL-MAQSUD AND </p><p>ABD AL-QUDUS TO PORTRAY THE MB AS JUST ANOTHER </p><p>POLITICAL ORGANIZATION THAT IS WILLING TO WORK IN A </p><p>MULTI-PARTY SYSTEM SEEMS TO US TO BE A TACTICAL </p><p>MANEOUVER RATHER THAN A SINCERE CONVERSION TO </p><p>DEMOCRATIC PRACTICES.  THE GOVERNMENT, OF COURSE, IS </p><p>NOT CONVINCED AND ALSO PROMINENT LEFT-WING OPPOSITION </p><p>FIGURES ARE NOT AT ALL UNHAPPY WITH THE GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>CRACK-DOWN ON THE MB.  THE ANTI-MB CROWD SAYS THE </p><p>ORGANIZATION\'S PHILOSOPHY WILL ALLOW IT TO REVERT TO </p><p>VIOLENT ACTIVISM WHEN THE TIME IS APPROPRIATE. </p><p>ACCORDING TO THEM, THE MB IS RELATIVELY WEAK RIGHT NOW </p><p>AND THUS PRACTICING "DISSIMULATION" WHEN IT TALKS ABOUT </p><p>DEMOCRACY.  "DISSIMULATION" IS A TRADITIONAL SHI\'ITE </p><p>DOCTRINE THAT HAS BEEN ADOPTED BY UNDERGROUND SUNNI </p><p>GROUPS LIKE THE MB. </p><p> </p><p>15. (C) THOUGH THE GOVERNMENT HAS SUCCEEDED IN </p><p>WEAKENING THE MB, WE DOUBT IT CAN SHUT DOWN THIS </p><p>ORGANIZATION, WHICH HAS A 70-YEAR HISTORY IN EGYPT AND </p><p>FOLLOWERS AT ALL LEVELS OF SOCIETY.  ONE INDICATION OF </p><p>ITS DIVERSITY:  MUHAMMAD ABD AL-QUDUS, BORN INTO </p><p>CAIRO\'S ARISTOCRACY, SEEMS TO HAVE ADOPTED POLITICAL </p><p>ISLAM AS A REACTION TO HIS FAMILY\'S MILITANT </p><p>SECULARISM.  HIS MATERNAL GRANDMOTHER, FATMA AL-YOUSEF, </p><p>FOUNDED THE LEFT-WING WEEKLY "ROSE AL-YOUSEF" AND HIS </p><p>FATHER, IHSAN ABD AL-QUDUS, WROTE NOVELS FAMOUS </p><p>THROUGHOUT THE ARAB WORLD FOR PORTRAYING THE TRAVAILS </p><p>OF MODERN ARAB WOMEN.  THE SON IS ALSO A RESPECTED </p><p>WRITER OF THE INTELLIGENTSIA CLASS, WHOSE MEMBERS OF </p><p>ALL PERSUASIONS MAINTAIN OLD SCHOOL TIES AND SIT </p><p>TOGETHER CHATTING AMIABLY WHILE DISAGREEING WITH EACH </p><p>OTHER ON VIRTUALLY EVERYTHING. </p><p>END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BATTLE </p><p></p></div>
