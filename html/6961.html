<p>UNCLAS HARARE 000638 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PDPAP FOR DALTON, MITCHELL AND SIMS </p><p>IRAQ PD FOR SMITH, PINESS AND ROOKARD </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: IZ, PREL, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION WAR WITH IRAQ; HARARE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under headline "Al Jazeera and the war in Iraq" </p><p>      the pro-government weekly "The Sunday Mirror" </p><p>      dedicated its March 30 editorial to hailing the </p><p>      Arabic language television network Al Jazeera\'s </p><p>      coverage of the United States-led war against Iraq. </p><p>      "While the U.S. and its allies were absolutely </p><p>      unchallenged on the propaganda battlefront in the </p><p>      1991 Gulf War, this time round the world can be </p><p>      assured of an alternative view on the ongoing war," </p><p>      the paper stated.  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   ". . .The UK/U.S. propaganda war strategy has </p><p>      suffered a major setback with Al Jazeera\'s prominent </p><p>      and competing coverage of the war in Iraq.  While the </p><p>      U.S. has bludgeoned virtually everyone with high- </p><p>      sounding claims of its avowed support for media </p><p>      freedom, events currently unfolding do not exactly </p><p>      manifest Uncle Sam\'s love for press freedom.  On </p><p>      March 24, Al Jazeera launched an English-language Web </p><p>      site that almost immediately fell victim to hackers. </p><p>      . .  All this because Al Jazeera has broken the </p><p>      U.S./UK propaganda monopoly. . . While the U.S. and </p><p>      its allies were absolutely unchallenged on the </p><p>      propaganda battlefront in the 1991 Gulf War, this </p><p>      time round the world can be assured of an alternative </p><p>      view on the ongoing war." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
