<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ISTANBUL 001014 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/30/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: GENC (YOUNG) PARTY MACHINATIONS IN KIRKLARELI </p><p>PROVINCE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Consul General David Arnett for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Genc (Young) Party is in the process of attempting to </p><p>build a Turkey-wide base of support, seeking to co-opt local </p><p>politicians and appeal to broadly-nationalist sentiment. </p><p>Conversations with political leaders in one rural province </p><p>suggest that the combination of political ambition, murky </p><p>business dealings, and strong-arm tactics has left some of </p><p>the target audience wary of Cem Uzan and his party. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>Genc Comes to Kirklareli </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Kirklareli is the capital of the province of the same </p><p>name in Trakya (European Turkey), a city of 53,000 people, </p><p>with an economy centered on farming and border trade with </p><p>Bulgaria.  Kirklareli has a long history of center-left </p><p>voting, and CHP took the largest share in the last elections. </p><p> AK and Genc Party, both competing for center-right votes, </p><p>took second and third.  Longer-standing parties that </p><p>previously did well in the province (such as MHP, DYP, ANAP, </p><p>and DSP) were badly defeated, taking on average just a few </p><p>percent of the vote. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Genc Party has sought to consolidate and build upon </p><p>its base in Kirklareli in the wake of the November election, </p><p>establishing a party headquarters, courting local </p><p>politicians, and publicizing its populist rhetoric.  The </p><p>strategy, it appears, can only take Genc so far, as evidenced </p><p>by the comments of contacts in Kirklareli.  The province, </p><p>though a political backwater in itself, may be indicative of </p><p>a large segment of the rural and newly-urban voters who have </p><p>displayed some reticence toward Genc. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>By Any Means Necessary? </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) In the run-up to the November 2002 election, Kirkareli </p><p>sources report that Genc Party used particularly aggressive </p><p>tactics to attract voters there, including: forcing employees </p><p>of Telsim, Imar Bankasi, and other Uzan family businesses to </p><p>join Genc, using Uzan media outlets (including cell-phone </p><p>text messaging) to drive home the Genc message, increasing </p><p>profits to Uzan sub-contractors and distributors who visibly </p><p>supported the party and providing free cement for home </p><p>building to poorer segments of the population from the Uzans\' </p><p>nearby Halapasa Cement Factory. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) According to Kirklareli Mayor Cengiz Bagdan, many </p><p>local politicians were also approached to join Genc, himself </p><p>included.  Bagdan professes no interest currently in leaving </p><p>nationalist MHP, though he admits that may change as local </p><p>elections get closer. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Separately, Sait Lutfu Gur, Chairman of the Chamber of </p><p>Tradesmen and Craftsmen, confirmed Genc Party\'s aggressive </p><p>politics.  Gur believes, however, that the nationalist </p><p>rhetoric of Genc combined with strong-arm tactics has little </p><p>resonance in this area of Turkey.  Kirklareli\'s economy was </p><p>more lightly affected than elsewhere by economic crises, and </p><p>has significantly less unemployment.  Benefiting from free </p><p>trade, Gur and his colleaugues passionately argued for a </p><p>reduction in trade barriers as the best way to help the </p><p>Turkish economy, which runs against some of Genc\'s more </p><p>strident xenophobic rhetoric. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Rural, statist, and moderately conservative, </p><p>Kirklareli has many traits similar to other Genc strongholds. </p><p> Some of Genc\'s more unseemly strong arm tactics have kept a </p><p>lid on any budding enthusiasm there, especially when coupled </p><p>with Kirklareli\'s pro-trade, left-of-center attitudes. </p><p>ARNETT </p><p></p></div>
