<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L BEIRUT 002749 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.0.12356:DECL:07/12/00 </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, PTER, LE </p><p>SUBJECT:  AMAL PERSPECTIVES ON HIZBALLAH CHANGES </p><p> </p><p>REFTEL:  A) BEIRUT 2725, B) BEIRUT 2659 </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL -- ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY.  HIZBALLAH ANNOUNCED THE RE-ELECTION OF </p><p>ITS TWO TOP LEADERS AND SOME MODEST STRUCTURAL </p><p>CHANGES, BUT HAS NOT RELEASED NAMES OF NEW </p><p>CONSULTATIVE COUNCIL MEMBERS, OSTENSIBLY ON SECURITY </p><p>GROUNDS.  A SENIOR AMAL OFFICIAL CONFIRMED HIS </p><p>PARTY\'S UNDERSTANDING THAT HIZBALLAH ULTRA-EXTREMIST </p><p>SUBHI TUFAYLI IS OUT.  THE AMAL SOURCE SAID THE </p><p>CHANGE CAME AMIDST A WIDER SHIFT IN POWER WITHIN </p><p>HIZBALLAH, AWAY FROM BIQA\' VALLEY CADRES TOWARD </p><p>SOUTHERN LEADERS.  WHILE THE CHANGES WITHIN HIZBALLAH </p><p>ARE SEEN HERE AS FURTHER STEPS PREPARATORY TO AN </p><p>EVENTUAL TRANSITION FROM MILITIA TO LEGITIMATE </p><p>POLITICAL PARTY, AMAL BELIEVES (OR AT LEAST HOPES) </p><p>THAT HIZBALLAH IS MISTAKEN IN ITS CONFIDENCE OF </p><p>SYRIAN BACKING FOR ITS POLITICAL AMBITIONS IN AN ERA </p><p>OF PEACE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  HIZBALLAH HAS ANNOUNCED THE RE-ELECTION OF </p><p>SECRETARY GENERAL HASSAN NASRALLAH AND DEPUTY SECGEN </p><p>NA\'IM QASSIM AT A GENERAL CONVENTION EARLIER THIS </p><p>MONTH, BUT WILL NOT RELEASE THE MEMBERSHIP OF THE </p><p>CONSULTATIVE COUNCIL (MAJLIS ASH-SHURA).  A PARTY </p><p>SPOKESMAN CITED THE ISRAELI THREAT AS REASON FOR </p><p>SECRECY.  THERE WAS NO WORD ON WHETHER NASRALLAH HAS </p><p>RETURNED FROM IRAN, WHERE HE WAS PRESUMABLY VETTING </p><p>THE CONVENTION RESULTS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  MUHAMMAD \'UBAYD, POLITICAL ADVISOR FOR AMAL </p><p>MOVEMENT AND SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE INFORMATION </p><p>MINISTRY, CONFIRMED TO US THAT SUBHI TUFAYLI, FORMER </p><p>PARTY SECGEN AND A RECOGNIZED LEADER OF THE MOST </p><p>RADICAL TREND IN HIZBALLAH, DID NOT WIN RE-ELECTION </p><p>TO THE COUNCIL.  \'UBAYD SAW TUFAYLI\'S OUSTER AS PART </p><p>OF A TREND AT THE CONVENTION TO EASE OUT BIQA\' VALLEY </p><p>ELEMENTS IN FAVOR OF SOUTHERNERS (THE HOME BASE OF </p><p>NA S RALLAH ) . </p><p> </p><p>5.  THE BIQA\'-SOUTH FAULT LINE COINCIDES GENERALLY </p><p>WITH A (COMPARATIVE) HAWK-DOVE SPLIT INSIDE THE </p><p>PARTY.  HIZBALLAH HAS A STRONGER BASE IN THE BIQA\' </p><p>AND AMONG SOUTHERN SUBURB RESIDENTS ORIGINALLY FROM </p><p>THE BIQA\', THAN IT DOES IN THE SOUTH, WHERE POLITICAL </p><p>LOYALITIES ARE MORE LIKELY TO REST WITH AMAL AND THE </p><p>OLD LANDED FAMILIES.  HIZBALLAH HAS WORKED TO MAKE </p><p>IN-ROADS THERE, BUT THE UNPOPULARITY OF THE </p><p>RESISTANCE IN MANY QUARTERS ALONG THE FRONT LINES HAS </p><p>UNDERMINED THOSE EFFORTS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  CONSOLIDATION OF HIZBALLAH LEADERSHIP IN SOUTHERN </p><p>HANDS IS CONSISTENT WITH THE STRENGTHENING OF THOSE </p><p>FORCES WITHIN THE PARTY WHO ARE BRACED FOR AN END TO </p><p>MILITIA ACTIVITIES, AND WANT TO PREPARE FOR MORE </p><p>NORMAL POLITICAL ACTIVISM.  AMAL OFFICIAL \'UBAYD </p><p>CLAIMED TO US, HOWEVER, THAT HIZBALLAH\'S MAINSTREAM </p><p>HAS OVER-ESTIMATED SYRIAN WILLINGNESS TO PROTECT THE </p><p>PARTY ONCE PEACE WITH ISRAEL IS REACHED.  COMMENT: </p><p>THIS OBSERVATION COULD BE WISHFUL THINKING ON THE </p><p>PART OF AMAL, WHICH IS STRUGGLING WITH HIZBALLAH FOR </p><p>SHI\'A LOYALTIES.  IF DAMASCUS IS TRUE TO FORM, IT </p><p>WOULD MOST LIKELY NOURISH BUT CONFINE HIZBALLAH, AS A </p><p>TOOL TO KEEP SYRIA\'S PRINCIPAL SHI\'A ALLY, NABIH </p><p>BERRI, IN LINE.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>7.  REF A CONVEYS OTHER DETAILS ON CHANGES MADE </p><p>WITHIN HIZBALLAH, AS REPORTED BY IBRAHIM AL-AMIN IN </p><p>"AL-SAFIR" NEWSPAPER.  IN SHORT, TYRE-BASED HIZBALLAH </p><p>MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT MUHAMMAD RA\'D BECAME HEAD OF THE </p><p>POLITICAL COUNCIL (THE RENAMED POLITBURO), BUMPING </p><p>OUT HUSSEIN KHALIL.  KHALIL WAS NAMED POLITICAL </p><p>ADVISOR TO NASRALLAH, IN WHAT LOOKS LIKE A </p><p>COME-DOWN.  A JIHADI COUNCIL WAS MADE TO CONSOLIDATE </p><p>CONTROL OVER ALL SECURITY AND MILITARY OPERATIONS, </p><p>UNDER SOUTHERNER HASHIM SAFI-AD-DIN.  THE BLOC OF </p><p>HIZBALLAH MPS GAINED A MORE FORMAL ROLE WITHIN THE </p><p>PARTY WITH THE CREATION OF THE "COUNCIL OF THE </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY BLOC."  A LEBANESE REPRESENTATIVE OF </p><p>AL-KHAMEIN\'I, THE BIQA\'-BASED MUHAMMAD YAZBEK, </p><p>RETAINED A PLACE IN THE EXECUTIVE BOARD OF THE </p><p>CONSULTATIVE COUNCIL. </p><p> </p><p>8. FOR WHAT IT IS WORTH, PAPERS ALSO REPORT TRENDS </p><p>WHICH SUGGEST BUSINESS AS USUAL FOR HIZBALLAH:  THE </p><p>OFTEN INACCURATE DAILY "NIDA\' AL-WATAN" REPORTED THE </p><p>RE-ELECTION OF IMAD MUGHNIYAH AS THE CENTRAL SECURITY </p><p>CHIEF, WITH FOUR ASSISTANTS NAMED MUSTAFA BADR </p><p>AD-DIN, TALAL HAMIYAH, HAJ MUHAMMAD AHMAZ, AND </p><p>HUSAYNI ATRYSSI.  THE MORE RESPECTED "AN-NAHAR" </p><p>REPORTS THAT HIZBALLAH HAS RECEIVED MORE </p><p>SOPHISTICATED WEAPONS FOR USE AGAINST THE ISRAELIS, </p><p>BUT OFFERS NO FURTHER CLARIFICATION. </p><p> </p><p>SCHLICHER </p><p></p></div>
