RANGOON 30 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: COM Carmen Martinez for Reasons 1.5 (B,D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: Mounting public frustration with the </p><p>country\'s disgraced, largely Chinese-owned, private banks has </p><p>led to fears among the Chinese business community and others </p><p>of an anti-Chinese backlash.  Though this remains a </p><p>possibility, particularly if SPDC decides it needs a </p><p>convenient scapegoat, the vast majority of depositers appear </p><p>thus far more inclined to blame the SPDC, rather than the </p><p>Chinese, for their troubles.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>Chinese Dominance in Banking Sector </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) There is no denying the Chinese dominance in the </p><p>banking sector.  Of the nation\'s twenty private banks, only </p><p>eight are actually owned and operated by private citizens (as </p><p>opposed to various government ministries or the military\'s </p><p>economic arms).  Of these eight privately held private banks, </p><p>six of them have chairmen or primary owners of Chinese </p><p>descent.  Of the odd banks out, one is run by a Shan crony of </p><p>Senior General Than Shwe, the other by a Burman. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The Chinese were less prominent in the recently </p><p>imploded informal financial institutions as, in those, </p><p>Burmans and Muslims also played a large role.  Of the 16-17 </p><p>shadow banks whose ownership we have been able to trace, only </p><p>four were Chinese or ethnic Chinese Burmese.  Four were </p><p>Indian or Muslim, and the rest Burman. </p><p> </p><p>Finger Pointing </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) There is some concern (particularly in the Chinese </p><p>business community) that the dominance of ethnic Chinese in </p><p>the disgraced banking sector will trigger public resentment </p><p>against the Chinese population.  There is some history of </p><p>this, with anti-Chinese riots occuring in the 1960s.  Indeed, </p><p>it is not outside the SPDC\'s bag of tricks to try and divert </p><p>political discontent caused by its bungling of the banking </p><p>crisis, by surreptitiously feeding the notion that the </p><p>"conniving" Chinese are to blame. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) However, barring some obvious act of provocation, we </p><p>don\'t think this is likely.  Commentators here tell us that </p><p>while people may have lost faith in the banks, most don\'t </p><p>connect their downfall with the ethnicity of their ownership. </p><p> However, the problem may be that people here, consciously or </p><p>unconciously, factor enthnicity into their calculations about </p><p>the probability of a GOB rescue.  In any case, the banks </p><p>hardest hit by withdrawals (AWB, Yoma, MUB, MOB, and </p><p>Mayflower) have by and large been owned or managed by ethnic </p><p>Chinese banks.  Finally, the possibility of ethnic strife </p><p>remains in the back of many minds.  As one economic </p><p>journalist warned us, because of residual anti-Chinese </p><p>sentiment among Burmans, it would not be too difficult to </p><p>stir up ethnic-derived conflict. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) That all said, our feeling so far is that the public\'s </p><p>ire will fall squarely on the ruling junta.  After enduring </p><p>fifteen years of economic mismanagement and political </p><p>oppression by the SLORC/SPDC regime, the public (at least in </p><p>Rangoon) is primed to blame its daily woes on the junta.  In </p><p>the meantime, the ethnic Chinese chairmen and management of </p><p>the private banks are bending over backward to regain their </p><p>customers trust -- through notices, advertising, and efforts </p><p>to explain the situation and fairly disburse available funds. </p><p> Provided these bankers are not caught up in some new </p><p>scandal, they should be able to avoid any undue blame for the </p><p>current crisis. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
