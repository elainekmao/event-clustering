(S) THOMAS OSORIO (STRICTLY PROTECT), HEAD OF ICTY\'S </p><p>ZAGREB OFFICE, TOLD US MARCH 4 THAT RECENT STATEMENTS BY OTP </p><p>SPOKESPERSON HARTMANN AND OTP POLITICAL ADVISOR JORIS </p><p>LAMBASTING THE GOC FOR ITS FAILURE TO CAPTURE ICTY INDICTEE </p><p>ANTE GOTOVINA WERE "UNPROFESSIONAL."  OSORIO TOLD US THAT HE </p><p>HAS SEEN NO CREDIBLE EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT RECENT OTP CLAIMS </p><p>THAT GOTOVINA IS "MOVING FREELY" IN CROATIA.  ACCORDING TO </p><p>OSORIO, THE OTP WAS PREPARED CITE THE GOC FOR NON-COMPLIANCE </p><p>ON TECHNICAL GROUNDS IF CROATIA DID NOT SERVE THE ICTY </p><p>INDICTMENT TO GENERAL BOBETKO, EVEN THOUGH THE ICTY JUDGE WAS </p><p>SET TO RULE THAT THE GENERAL\'S HEALTH PRECLUDED A TRIAL. </p><p>WHILE THE OTP\'S FRUSTRATION IS UNDERSTANDABLE, MISMANAGEMENT </p><p>OF THE GOTOVINA CASE AND PILING ON OVER BOBETKO UNDERCUTS THE </p><p>ICTY\'S CREDIBILITY WITH ITS ALLIES AND STRENGTHENS THE HAND </p><p>OF REJECTIONISTS JUST AS THE TRIBUNAL ENTERS A PERIOD OF </p><p>INCREASING TENSION WITH THE GOC OVER NON-COMPLIANCE WITH </p><p>DOCUMENT REQUESTS RELATED TO CROATIA\'S INVOLVEMENT IN BOSNIA </p><p>DURING THE WAR. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p>                          SECRET </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00470  01 OF 03  052218Z </p><p> </p><p>ANOTHER INTEMPERATE BLAST FROM THE OTP </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) IN SEPARATE MEDIA INTERVIEWS ON FEBRUARY 27 AND 28, </p><p>OTP SPOKESPERSON FLORENCE HARTMANN AND OTP POLITICAL ADVISOR </p><p>JEAN-JAQUES JORIS ISSUED STATEMENTS SAYING THAT ICTY INDICTEE </p><p>ANTE GOTOVINA WAS "MOVING FREELY IN CROATIA," AND THAT THE </p><p>GOC FAILED TO USE THE NUMEROUS OPPORTUNITIES IT HAD TO CATCH </p><p>THE FUGITIVE.  JORIS WENT ON TO ADD THAT THE OTP HAD PROVIDED </p><p>"EVIDENCE" TO THE GOC ON GOTOVINA, BUT YET THE GOC FAILED TO </p><p>ACT.  BOTH HARTMANN AND JORIS ALSO OPENLY CRITICIZED CROATIAN </p><p>COOPERATION ON DOCUMENT SHARING, HIGHLIGHTING SPECIFICALLY </p><p>ITS FAILURE TO DELIVER BOSNIA-RELATED DOCUMENTS DESPITE </p><p>NUMEROUS ICTY REQUESTS. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) ON MARCH 3, WE MET WITH CROATIAN POLICE DIRECTOR RANKO </p><p>OSTOJIC TO DISCUSS THE GOTOVINA CASE.  OSTOJIC REPEATED HIS </p><p>MANTRA THAT THE POLICE FAITHFULLY FOLLOW UP ON EVERY LEAD, </p><p>BUT ACTIONABLE EVIDENCE HAS NEVER BEEN PROVIDED (OR DEVELOPED </p><p>BY THE CROATIANS).  A SPECIAL POLICE UNIT HAS GOTOVINA\'S </p><p>FAMILY AND CLOSE ASSOCIATES UNDER SURVEILLANCE.  OSTOJIC, </p><p>HOWEVER, CATEGORICALLY REFUTED JORIS\' CHARGE ON GOTOVINA. </p><p>NEITHER HE, NOR AMBASSADOR KRNIC, THE HEAD OF THE GOC OFFICE </p><p>FOR COOPERATION WITH ICTY, WHO RECENTLY VISITED THE HAGUE ON </p><p>CONSULTATIONS, HAD RECEIVED ANY INFORMATION FROM THE OTP ON </p><p>GOTOVINA\'S WHEREABOUTS. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) PUBLICLY, THE GOC HAS DENIED THAT THERE IS ANY BREAK </p><p>IN CROATIA\'S COOPERATION WITH THE ICTY.  PRIME MINISTER RACAN </p><p>COMMENTED THAT, "FOR VARIOUS REASONS," PEOPLE ARE ATTEMPTING </p><p>                          SECRET </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00470  01 OF 03  052218Z </p><p>"TO FABRICATE" A CONFLICT BETWEEN ICTY AND THE GOC. </p><p> </p><p>OTP NOT PROFESSIONAL </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (S) IN LIGHT OF THE WAR OF WORDS BETWEEN THE OTP AND THE </p><p>GOC, THE APPARENT DISCONNECT BETWEEN THE OTP AND THE GOC OVER </p><p>INFORMATION SHARING AND OUR CONCERNS -- EXPRESSED REFTEL -- </p><p>THAT THE OTP DOES NOT HAVE A COHERENT STRATEGY FOR DEALING </p><p>WITH CROATIA, WE MET MARCH 4 WITH ICTY ZAGREB OFFICE HEAD </p><p>THOMAS OSORIO (STRICTLY PROTECT THROUGHOUT).  WHILE CALLING </p><p>THE OTP\'S HANDLING OF THE GOTOVINA CASE AMATEURISH, OSORIO </p><p>CONFIRMED THAT THE OTP\'S COMPLAINTS ABOUT GOC DOCUMENT </p><p>SHARING ARE VALID AND ARE REACHING CRISIS LEVELS. </p><p> </p><p>6. (S) ON GOTOVINA, THE OTP IS ITS OWN WORST ENEMY, OSORIO </p><p>SAID.  AS FAR AS HE KNOWS, THERE IS NO NEW CREDIBLE </p><p>INFORMATION AVAILABLE DEMONSTRATING GOTOVINA\'S PRESENCE IN </p><p>CROATIA.  THERE WERE REPORTED SIGHTINGS OF GOTOVINA IN ZAGREB </p><p>AROUND CHRISTMAS.  HOWEVER, THE OTI INVESTIGATORS, WHO </p><p>DEVELOPED THE LEAD FROM INTERVIEWS WITH OTHER CROATIAN WAR </p><p>CRIMES SUSPECTS, ONLY PROVIDED THE INFORMATION TO THE </p><p>CROATIAN POLICE WELL AFTER THE FACT.  BY THAT TIME, THE LEAD </p><p>-- IF INDEED IT EVER WAS CREDIBLE -- HAD GONE STALE. THIS </p><p>ERROR WAS PART OF A CONTINUING TREND AMONG OTP OFFICIALS WHO </p><p> </p><p>                          SECRET </p><p> </p><p>                              SECRET        PTQ5115 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  00470  02 OF 03  052222Z </p><p>ACTION SWCI-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   COR-01   NP-00    AF-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  CIAE-00 </p><p>      INL-00   USNW-00  DODE-00  DOEE-00  PERC-00  SRPP-00  DS-00 </p><p>      EAP-00   EUR-00   FBIE-00  VC-00    IPS-01   TEDE-00  INR-00 </p><p>      IO-00    LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00 </p><p>      OIC-02   OMB-01   PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00 </p><p>      SCT-00   SP-00    SSO-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00 </p><p>      PRM-00   DRL-01   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /008W </p><p>                  ------------------3FB428  052223Z /38 </p><p>O 041825Z MAR 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 9595 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY LONDON IMMEDIATE </p><p>AMEMBASSY MOSCOW IMMEDIATE </p><p>AMEMBASSY SARAJEVO IMMEDIATE </p><p>AMEMBASSY THE HAGUE IMMEDIATE </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK IMMEDIATE </p><p>USMISSION USNATO IMMEDIATE </p><p>USOFFICE PRISTINA IMMEDIATE </p><p> </p><p>S E C R E T SECTION 02 OF 03 ZAGREB 000470 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>C O R R E C T E D COPY (ADDING PRISTINA) </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EUR, EUR/SCE, S/WCI </p><p>THE HAGUE FOR JOHNSON/KAYE/WHEATON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 1.6X6: 5 YEARS AFTER CLOSURE OF ICTY </p><p>                          SECRET </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00470  02 OF 03  052222Z </p><p>TAGS: KAWC, ICTY, PGOV, PREL, HR </p><p>SUBJECT: OTP BOMBAST ON GOTOVINA / CROATIAN NON-COOPERATION </p><p>ON DOCUMENT SHARING </p><p> </p><p>REFUSE TO VERIFY INFORMATION WITH THE LOCAL ZAGREB OFFICE </p><p>WHICH HAS BEEN COORDINATING THE GOTOVINA INVESTIGATION WITH </p><p>THE CROATIAN POLICE FROM THE OUTSET.  INSTEAD, OTI </p><p>INVESTIGATORS PASS ON THOSE ERRONEOUS, STALE OR CIRCULAR </p><p>LEADS TO JORIS, HARTMANN AND DEL PONTE AS FACT.  OSORIO SAID </p><p>THAT HE URGENTLY CONTACTED OTP ADVISOR ANTON NIKIFOROV TO </p><p>INTERCEDE WITH HARTMANN AND JORIS TO CORRECT THE RECORD.  HE </p><p>ALSO ASKED THAT NIKOFOROV ENSURE THAT ANY FUTURE STATEMENTS </p><p>ON GOTOVINA ARE SUPPORTED BY INCONTROVERTIBLE FACT. </p><p> </p><p>DOCUMENT SHARING: REAL GOC "NON-COMPLIANCE"? </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (S) OSORIO SAYS THAT THE OTP VIEW OF CROATIAN COOPERATION </p><p>ON DOCUMENT SHARING HAS CHANGED DRAMATICALLY FOR THE WORSE </p><p>SINCE LAST OCTOBER, WHEN DEL PONTE TOLD THE UNSC THAT SHE WAS </p><p>SATISFIED WITH CROATIAN COOPERATION.  OVER THE PAST FEW </p><p>MONTHS, THE OTP HAS CONDUCTED A COMPREHENSIVE INFORMATION </p><p>AUDIT AND HAS DETERMINED THAT THE GOC IS SUBSTANTIALLY </p><p>LAGGING IN RESPONDING TO DOCUMENT REQUESTS ON A WIDE RANGE OF </p><p>ISSUES.  AS REPORTED REFTEL, THE MAJOR GOC FAILING CONTINUES </p><p>TO BE THE PROVISION OF DOCUMENTS ON CROATIAN INVOLVEMENT IN </p><p>THE WAR IN BOSNIA. </p><p> </p><p>8. (S) WE ASKED OSORIO TO ADDRESS THE CROATIAN ARGUMENT, NOW </p><p>BANDIED IN THE LOCAL MEDIA, THAT OTP DOCUMENT REQUESTS ARE </p><p>TOO BROAD.  OSORIO SAID THAT SUCH CHARGES ARE FALSE. </p><p>                          SECRET </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00470  02 OF 03  052222Z </p><p>INVESTIGATORS ARE PUTTING TOGETHER THE FINAL PIECES OF THEIR </p><p>CASES AND KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THEY ARE LOOKING FOR, HE SAID. </p><p>IN THE CASE OF THE BOSNIA, REQUESTS ARE VERY DETAILED, EVEN </p><p>TO THE POINT WHERE INVESTIGATORS ARE SEEKING SPECIFIC </p><p>TRANSCRIPTS OF CONVERSATIONS OF PRESIDENT TUDJMAN AND </p><p>THEN-DEFENSE MINISTER GOJKO SUSAK FROM 1993.  THESE </p><p>TRANSCRIPTS REPORTEDLY SHOW TUDJMAN DECIDING WHICH OFFICIALS </p><p>SHOULD BE APPOINTED TO THE CROATIAN PARA-GOVERNMENT OF </p><p>HERCEG-BOSNA AND ORDERING SPECIFIC UNITS OF THE CROATIAN </p><p>MILITARY (HV) TO ENTER AND FIGHT IN BOSNIA.  ACCORDING TO </p><p>OSORIO, IN ONE CASE, THE TRIBUNAL HAS A COPY OF SUCH A </p><p>TRANSCRIPT AND MERELY ARE SEEKING A CERTIFIED COPY FOR </p><p>EVIDENTIARY PURPOSES.  OSORIO SAID THAT THE GOC ALSO HAS </p><p>FAILED TO PROVIDE BANK RECORDS RELATED TO THE TRANSFER OF </p><p>FUNDING THROUGH PRIVREDNA BANKA TO SUPPORT HV AND HVO </p><p>OPERATIONS IN BOSNIA. </p><p> </p><p>9. (S) ON JANUARY 30, DEL PONTE WROTE A LETTER TO DEPUTY </p><p>PREMIER GORAN GRANIC, IN WHICH, ACCORDING TO OSORIO, THE ICTY </p><p>CHIEF PROSECUTOR READ THE GOC "THE RIOT ACT."  THE LETTER </p><p>STATES THAT THE OTP IS "CONCERNED AND DISAPPOINTED" THAT </p><p>DOCUMENTS "ARE BEING WITHHELD" AND THAT CROATIA IS "NOT IN </p><p>COMPLIANCE" WITH ITS UNSC AND DAYTON OBLIGATIONS ON THE </p><p>PROVISION OF BIH DOCUMENTATION.  THE JANUARY 30 LETTER STATES </p><p>THAT IF THE GOC DOES NOT HAND OVER THE DOCUMENTS IN QUESTION </p><p>BY APRIL 4, THE OTP WILL REQUEST THAT A JUDGE SUBPOENA THEM. </p><p>THE OTP ALSO WILL ASK THE JUDGE TO ISSUE A SEARCH WARRANT, </p><p>ARMED WITH WHICH ICTY OFFICIALS WOULD APPROACH PRIVREDNA </p><p>BANKA TO OPEN ITS ARCHIVES.  ADDITIONALLY, THE OTP WILL </p><p>PETITION THE JUDGE TO SUBPOENA THE GOC -- EITHER GRANIC OR </p><p>KRNIC -- TO EXPLAIN TO THE TRIBUNAL CROATIAN NON-COMPLIANCE. </p><p>                          SECRET </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00470  02 OF 03  052222Z </p><p>THE ACT OF SUBPOENAING WOULD TRIGGER A REPORT OF </p><p>NON-COMPLIANCE TO THE UNSC, OSORIO ADDED. </p><p> </p><p>10. (S) GRANIC REPLIED TO DEL PONTE IN MID-FEBRUARY, </p><p>AFFIRMING THAT THE GOC WOULD MAKE ITS "BEST EFFORT" TO FIND </p><p>THE DOCUMENTS IN QUESTION, BUT SOME DOCUMENTS "DID NOT </p><p>EXIST."  OTHER DOCUMENTS WOULD NOT BE "EASY TO FIND" BECAUSE </p><p>THE INFORMATION THAT THE OTP PROVIDED WAS NOT SPECIFIC </p><p>ENOUGH.  WITH REGARD TO THE BANK DOCUMENTS, GRANIC SAID THAT </p><p>GOC EFFORTS TO PROVIDE THE DOCUMENTS WERE COMPLICATED BY </p><p>CROATIAN BANK SECRECY LAWS. </p><p> </p><p>11. (S) WHILE OSORIO COULD NOT CONFIRM WHY THE GOC WAS </p><p>WITHHOLDING THE DOCUMENTS -- IT IS COMMON KNOWLEDGE THAT HV </p><p>UNITS FOUGHT IN BOSNIA DURING THE WAR -- OSORIO AGREED WITH </p><p>US THAT ONE POSSIBLE MOTIVE COULD BE GOC FEAR THAT THE </p><p>DOCUMENTS WOULD CONFIRM DIRECT CROATIAN INTERVENTION IN </p><p>BOSNIA FROM THE OUTSET OF THE WAR AS WELL AS THE INTENTION OF </p><p>PRESIDENT TUDJMAN TO CARVE OUT OF BOSNIA AN ETHNICALLY PURE </p><p>INDEPENDENT CROATIAN ENTITY.  OSORIO BELIEVED THESE FACTS </p><p>WOULD PROVIDE SUFFICIENT BASIS FOR THE GOBIH TO FILE A STRONG </p><p>SUIT AGAINST CROATIA FOR WAR REPARATIONS BEFORE THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE. </p><p> </p><p>BOBETKO CASE STILL SIMMERING </p><p> </p><p>                          SECRET </p><p> </p><p>                              SECRET        PTQ5124 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  00470  03 OF 03  052224Z </p><p>ACTION SWCI-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   COR-01   NP-00    AF-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  CIAE-00 </p><p>      INL-00   USNW-00  DODE-00  DOEE-00  PERC-00  SRPP-00  DS-00 </p><p>      EAP-00   EUR-00   FBIE-00  VC-00    IPS-01   TEDE-00  INR-00 </p><p>      IO-00    LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00 </p><p>      OIC-02   OMB-01   PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00 </p><p>      SCT-00   SP-00    SSO-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00 </p><p>      PRM-00   DRL-01   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /008W </p><p>                  ------------------3FB45A  052224Z /38 </p><p>O 041825Z MAR 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 9596 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY LONDON IMMEDIATE </p><p>AMEMBASSY MOSCOW IMMEDIATE </p><p>AMEMBASSY SARAJEVO IMMEDIATE </p><p>AMEMBASSY THE HAGUE IMMEDIATE </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK IMMEDIATE </p><p>USMISSION USNATO IMMEDIATE </p><p>USOFFICE PRISTINA IMMEDIATE </p><p> </p><p>S E C R E T SECTION 03 OF 03 ZAGREB 000470 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>C O R R E C T E D COPY (ADDING PRISTINA) </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EUR, EUR/SCE, S/WCI </p><p>THE HAGUE FOR JOHNSON/KAYE/WHEATON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 1.6X6: 5 YEARS AFTER CLOSURE OF ICTY </p><p>                          SECRET </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00470  03 OF 03  052224Z </p><p>TAGS: KAWC, ICTY, PGOV, PREL, HR </p><p>SUBJECT: OTP BOMBAST ON GOTOVINA / CROATIAN NON-COOPERATION </p><p>ON DOCUMENT SHARING </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12. (S) OSORIO DESCRIBED DEL PONTE AS BEING FRUSTRATED WITH </p><p>BOTH THE ICTY PRESIDING JUDGE AND THE GOC ON THE BOBETKO </p><p>CASE.  DEL PONTE IS "PISSED OFF" WITH THE PRESIDING JUDGE </p><p>BECAUSE HE HAS NOT RULED ON THE MEDICAL EXPERT TEAM\'S REPORT </p><p>ON GENERAL BOBETKO AND ON THE GENERAL\'S FITNESS TO STAND </p><p>TRIAL.  THE OTP\'S EXPECTATION STILL IS THAT THE JUDGE WILL </p><p>RULE THAT BOBETKO IS UNFIT. </p><p> </p><p>13. (S) AT THE SAME TIME, DEL PONTE IS FURIOUS AT THE </p><p>CROATIAN COURTS FOR NOT ORDERING THAT THE BOBETKO INDICTMENT </p><p>BE DELIVERED TO THE ACCUSED OR TO HIS LAWYERS, AS IS </p><p>SPECIFIED UNDER CROATIAN LAW.  POINTING TO A FEBRUARY 13 </p><p>LOCAL PRESS REPORT IN WHICH BOBETKO RECEIVED LOCAL HDZ </p><p>OFFICIALS IN THE HOSPITAL, OSORIO SAID THAT IF BOBETKO IS FIT </p><p>ENOUGH TO RECEIVE LOCAL GUESTS, HE IS FIT ENOUGH TO RECEIVE </p><p>THE INDICTMENT.  THE OTP IS PREPARING A REQUEST TO THE GOC </p><p>THAT IT -- AS THE OTP\'S LOCAL AGENT -- FILE A MOTION BEFORE </p><p>THE PRESIDING ZAGREB JUDGE TO REQUEST HIM TO SERVE THE </p><p>INDICTMENT TO BOBETKO OR HIS LEGAL REPRESENTATIVES.  FAILURE </p><p>OF THE GOC TO ACT ON THE OTP\'S BEHALF WOULD BE ANOTHER REASON </p><p>TO CITE CROATIA FOR NON-COMPLIANCE, OSORIO SAID.  WHILE HE </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGED THAT SOME COULD PERCEIVE THIS APPROACH AS "SOUR </p><p>GRAPES," HE SAID IT WAS AN IMPORTANT POINT OF PRINCIPAL THAT </p><p>STATES COMPLY FULLY WITH ALL THEIR OBLIGATIONS.  THIS IS ONE </p><p>SUCH CASE. </p><p>                          SECRET </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00470  03 OF 03  052224Z </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) THE OTP\'S PREDILECTION TO ISSUE UNSUBSTANTIATED </p><p>STATEMENTS ON GOTOVINA\'S WHEREABOUTS AND ITS LACK OF </p><p>CONSULTATION WITH ITS OWN EXPERTS ON THE GROUND DAMAGES THE </p><p>OTP\'S CREDIBILITY WITH THE ICTY\'S INTERNATIONAL SUPPORTERS, </p><p>PARTICULARLY WITH US AND THE BRITISH.  THE OTP MUST MAKE </p><p>CLEAR TO US WHAT EVIDENCE IT HAS ON GOTOVINA.  MORE BROADLY, </p><p>IT MUST DO A FAR BETTER JOB IN MANAGING ITS CROATIA PORTFOLIO </p><p>IF WE ARE TO WEIGH IN EFFECTIVELY ON ICTY\'S BEHALF WITH </p><p>RECALCITRANT GOC OFFICIALS. </p><p> </p><p>15. (C) THE OTP\'S MISHANDLING OF THE GOTOVINA CASE THREATENS </p><p>TO OVERSHADOW WHAT APPEARS TO BE SERIOUS CROATIAN </p><p>NON-COMPLIANCE OVER DOCUMENT SHARING.  THE OTP\'S </p><p>UNPROFESSIONAL BEHAVIOR ON GOTOVINA DIMINISHES THE </p><p>INSTITUTION, WEAKENS THE FEW PROFESSIONALS IN CROATIA INTENT </p><p>ON CAPTURING THE FUGITIVE, AND STRENGTHENS THE HAND OF THE </p><p>MANY HERE THAT ARGUE THAT ICTY IS ONLY PURSUING A PURELY </p><p>POLITICAL AGENDA. </p><p>ROSSIN </p><p> </p><p>                          SECRET </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
