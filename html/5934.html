<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 MONTREAL 000245 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>USDOC WASHDC </p><p>FCC WASHDC </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EB/CIP ALEWIS AND SSHIPMAN AND IO/OIC </p><p> </p><p>STATE PASS USTR FOR J.MCHALE AND J.MELLE </p><p> </p><p>FCC FOR INTERNATIONAL - D.ABELSON, J.MANN AND P.COOPER </p><p> </p><p>USDOC FOR 4310/IEP/OOC/WH/J.BENDER </p><p> </p><p>USDOC FOR 4320/ITA/MAC/WEST HEMIS/INTL- </p><p>AMER/AFFAIRS/JBENDER/CBUSQUETS </p><p> </p><p>USDOC FOR 6420/ITA/TD/IT/OFF OF TELECOM TECHNOLOGIES </p><p> </p><p>E.0. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, ECPS, EFIN, EINV, ETTC, CA, BEXP, Telecommunication, Communication </p><p>SUBJECT: QUEBEC TELECOMS STRUGGLE WITH OVERCAPACITY, LACK OF </p><p>CAPITAL </p><p> </p><p>REF: 02 OTTAWA 3290 </p><p> </p><p>1. SUMMARY: QUEBEC\'S TELECOMMUNICATION INDUSTRY, A SECTOR </p><p>WHICH AT ITS PEAK IN 1999 SUPPORTED 114,500 JOBS, CUT MORE </p><p>THAN 21,000 JOBS IN 2002.  ANALYSTS ARE PREDICTING ANOTHER </p><p>ROUGH YEAR WITH LOW INVESTMENT RATES AND A POSSIBLE INCREASE </p><p>IN BANKRUPTCIES IN SMALLER COMPANIES. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. MONTREAL-BASED BELL CANADA ENTERPRISES (BCE), CANADA\'S </p><p>LARGEST AND OLDEST TELECOM, ANNOUNCED IN JULY 2002 A C$8 </p><p>BILLION WRITE DOWN ON ITS INVESTMENTS IN TELEGLOBE, THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL LONG-DISTANCE SERVICES COMPANY.  IN THE WAKE </p><p>OF THE WRITE-DOWN, JEAN MONTY, WHO HAD BEEN WITH THE COMPANY </p><p>FOR 28 YEARS AND CEO SINCE 1997, RESIGNED.  MONTY WAS </p><p>REPLACED BY HIS OBVIOUS SUCCESSOR, MICHAEL SABIA, WHO HAVING </p><p>BEEN A PROTEGE OF PAUL TELLIER AT CN, MOVED TO BCE, IN 1999 </p><p>AS PRESIDENT OF BELL CANADA INTERNATIONAL.  SABIA\'S FIRST </p><p>MAJOR DECISION WAS TO SELL BCE\'S HIGHLY PROFITABLE PHONE </p><p>DIRECTORIES BUSINESS TO A U.S. INTEREST FOR $C3 BILLION IN </p><p>CASH IN ORDER TO REPURCHASE THE 20 PERCENT STAKE U.S.-BASED </p><p>SBC INC. HELD IN BCE.  JOHN HENDERSON, TELECOM ANALYST AT </p><p>SCOTIACAPITAL, SAYS "SABIA GOT A GREAT DEAL, BUT I DON\'T </p><p>THINK HE HAD TO SELL THE PHONE DIRECTORIES BUSINESS TO DO </p><p>IT."  HENDERSON FEARS THAT THE SALE OF WHAT WAS SEEN AS A </p><p>CASH COW MIGHT HURT BCE IN THE LONG-TERM.  BCE, WHICH HAD </p><p>AGREED TO EITHER REPURCHASE THE SBC STAKE OR PERMIT SBC TO </p><p>INCREASE ITS OWNERSHIP, OPTED TO MAINTAIN ITS INDEPENDENCE. </p><p> </p><p>3. MONTREAL-BASED MICROCELL TELECOMMUNICATIONS, OWNER OF THE </p><p>FIDO MOBILE PHONE BRAND (THE SMALLEST OF CANADA\'S FOUR </p><p>WIRELESS PHONE COMPANIES), FINALLY CAVED IN TO ITS CREDITORS </p><p>AND DECLARED BANKRUPTCY AFTER MOUNTING LOSSES AND OVER C$2 </p><p>BILLION IN DEBT.  THROUGH A COURT ORDERED RESTRUCTURING </p><p>PLAN, MICROCELL GAVE UP 68 PERCENT OF ITS EQUITY TO ITS </p><p>CREDITORS IN RETURN FOR THE ELIMINATION OF ITS C$2 BILLION </p><p>DEBT LOAD.  THE RESTRUCTURING PLAN CALLS FOR MICROCELL TO </p><p>DOUBLE ITS CUSTOMER BASE AND RETURN TO PROFITABILITY BY </p><p>2005.  "MICROCELL HAS A VERY DIFFICULT YEAR AHEAD, THERE IS </p><p>NO INDICATION THAT THEY WILL BE ABLE TO REBOUND FROM THE </p><p>BANKRUPTCY THIS YEAR, LET ALONE IN 2005," SAID </p><p>SCOTIACAPITAL\'S HENDERSON.  HE DOESN\'T BELIEVE THAT THE </p><p>BANKERS NOW HOLDING THE LION\'S SHARE OF MICROCELL STOCK WILL </p><p>HOLD THEIR EQUITY INTEREST FOR LONG. </p><p> </p><p>4. MICROCELL IS THE ONLY TELECOM COMPANY IN QUEBEC WHICH </p><p>USES THE EUROPEAN-FORMAT GSM MOBILE PHONE TECHNOLOGY, A </p><p>FORMAT THAT PERMITS USERS TO RETAIN THE SAME TELEPHONE </p><p>NUMBER AND MOBILE PHONE NO MATTER WHERE THEY TRAVEL, SIMPLY </p><p>BY CHANGING A CHIP WITHIN THE PHONE UNIT.  AS SUCH, ANALYSTS </p><p>HAVE SUGGESTED MICROCELL MIGHT BE A POSSIBLE TAKEOVER TARGET </p><p>FOR ONTARIO-BASED ROGERS/ATT WIRELESS, WHICH USES THE SAME </p><p>GSM TECHNOLOGY.  HENDERSON BELIEVES THERE ARE GREAT </p><p>SYNERGIES FOR ROGERS/ATT AND SUSPECTS A MOVE IN 2003. </p><p>LAWRENCE SURTEES OF INTERNATIONAL DATA CORPORATION CANADA </p><p>(IDCC), A LEADING INDUSTRY INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH COMPANY, </p><p>DOES NOT CONCUR, ASKING "WHY WOULD ROGERS PAY FOR SOMETHING </p><p>THAT IS REDUNDANT."  SURTEES SAYS MICROCELL\'S BIGGEST </p><p>PROBLEM IS LACK OF SERVICE COVERAGE OUTSIDE OF MAJOR AREAS, </p><p>LEADING TO THE HIGHEST RATE OF CUSTOMER "CHURN," (WHEN </p><p>CUSTOMERS DROP ONE SERVICE FOR ANOTHER).  FARAJ NAKHLEH, </p><p>VICE-PRESIDENT OF THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION OF </p><p>CANADA (ITAC) BELIEVES, FIDO IS A GOOD DEAL AND WILL BE </p><p>BOUGHT OUT THIS YEAR FOR UNDER $C1 BILLION.  "[FIDO] HAS </p><p>OVER ONE MILLION CUSTOMERS AND NO DEBT; WHO WOULD NOT WANT </p><p>SUCH A PLUM," HE ASKED. </p><p> </p><p>5. ANOTHER QUEBEC-BASED PLAYER IS TELECOMMUNICATION </p><p>EQUIPMENT MAKER SR TELECOM (SRT), A COMPANY WHOSE MARKET IS </p><p>ALMOST ENTIRELY OVERSEAS.  SRT HAS DEVELOPED AN INNOVATIVE </p><p>TECHNOLOGY THAT PROVIDES FIXED WIRE PHONE LINE SERVICE WITH </p><p>WIRELESS EQUIPMENT, ALLOWING REMOTE OR UNDERSERVED AREAS TO </p><p>HAVE FULL TELECOMMUNICATION ACCESS.  FOUNDED IN 1981, SRT </p><p>NOW EXPORTS ITS EQUIPMENT TO OVER 100 COUNTRIES WORLDWIDE. </p><p>CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER DAVID ADAMS TOLD AMBASSADOR CELLUCCI </p><p>DURING A RECENT VISIT TO THE COMPANY HEADQUARTERS IN </p><p>MONTREAL THAT SRT WANTS TO SELL ITS EQUIPMENT IN THE U.S. </p><p>ACCORDING TO ADAMS, "APPROXIMATELY SIX PERCENT OF THE U.S. </p><p>DOES NOT HAVE ACCESS TO LAND-LINE TELEPHONES; WE PLAN TO </p><p>FILL THAT NICHE."  HOWEVER, SRT HAS NOT ESCAPED THE BURST OF </p><p>THE TELECOM BUBBLE.  THE COMPANY HAD RECORD REVENUES IN 1999 </p><p>OF C$ 180 MILLION, BUT HAS POSTED TWO CONSECUTIVE YEARLY </p><p>LOSSES SINCE, INCLUDING A 2001 LOSS OF C$13.7 MILLION.  SRT </p><p>IS A SMALL PLAYER BY U.S. STANDARDS, BUT IT IS A WORLD </p><p>LEADER IN ITS FIELD.  EMILIO IODICE, VICE PRESIDENT OF SRT, </p><p>SAYS "WE HAVE A GOOD PRODUCT, ONE THE U.S. WILL BE ABLE TO </p><p>BENEFIT FROM AND ONE THAT WILL REDUCE THEIR DIGITAL DIVIDE." </p><p> </p><p>6. ONTARIO-BASED NORTEL NETWORKS, THE ONE-TIME DARLING OF </p><p>THE STOCK MARKET AND ONE OF THE WORLD\'S LARGEST TELEPHONE </p><p>SWITCHING PROVIDERS, HIT AN ALL-TIME LOW OF C$0.67 A SHARE </p><p>LAST OCTOBER.  NORTEL REDUCED ITS WORK FORCE IN CANADA BY </p><p>OVER 8,000 EMPLOYEES IN 2002 AND SOLD OFF ITS ONCE-PROUD HI- </p><p>TECH FACILITIES IN MONTREAL.  THE APPROXIMATELY 2,000 </p><p>REMAINING NORTEL EMPLOYEES IN QUEBEC ARE MAINLY SWITCHING </p><p>SYSTEM ENGINEERS AND TECHNICIANS. </p><p> </p><p>7. JOHN HENDERSON OF SCOTIACAPITAL NOTES THAT A </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEE IS DISCUSSING INCREASING THE GOC\'S </p><p>PRESENT LIMIT OF 20 PERCENT DIRECT FOREIGN OWNERSHIP IN </p><p>TELECOM COMPANIES TO 33.4 PERCENT (REFTEL).  HENDERSON </p><p>BELIEVES THAT RELAXATION OF FOREIGN INVESTMENT RULES WOULD </p><p>BRING NEW CAPITAL TO THE INDUSTRY.  MICHAEL SABIA, CEO OF </p><p>BCE, TOLD THE COMMITTEE (02/18/03) THE INCREASE IN FOREIGN </p><p>OWNERSHIP WOULD ALLOW A "GREATER FLOW" OF CAPITAL.  WHILE </p><p>HENDERSON DOES NOT THINK U.S. CAPITAL WOULD RUSH IN GIVEN </p><p>INCREASED INVESTMENT CAPABILITY, HE BELIEVES COMPANIES SUCH </p><p>AS FRANCE TELECOM AND DEUTSCHE TELECOM MIGHT BE TEMPTED. </p><p> </p><p>8. FARAJ NAKHLEH, VICE PRESIDENT OF ITAC, SEES 2003 AS A </p><p>YEAR OF CONSOLIDATIONS, WITH A SLOW RETURN TO PROFITABILITY. </p><p>HE AGREES WITH HENDERSON THAT A RELAXATION OF GOC FOREIGN </p><p>OWNERSHIP RESTRICTIONS COULD HELP INTRODUCE NEW CAPITAL INTO </p><p>THE QUEBEC TELECOMS.  THE DECISION, WHICH NAKHLEH TERMED </p><p>"LONG-OVERDUE," WOULD ALLOW EUROPEAN TELECOMS TO GAIN A </p><p>FOOTHOLD IN NORTH AMERICA THROUGH ENTRY INTO THE CANADIAN </p><p>MARKET. </p><p> </p><p>9. COMMENT: REVISIONS TO THE FOREIGN OWNERSHIP RESTRICTIONS </p><p>COULD BRING NEEDED CAPITAL TO THE QUEBEC TELECOM INDUSTRY, </p><p>BUT IN THE SHORT-TERM, THIS SECTOR IS EXPECTED TO </p><p>CONSOLIDATE RATHER THAN EXPAND.  AS SUCH, THE FIDO NETWORK </p><p>STANDS OUT AS A TAKEOVER TARGET, EVEN BY A EUROPEAN TELECOM, </p><p>GIVEN PARENT MICROCELL\'S DEBT-FREE STATUS FOLLOWING ITS </p><p>BANKRUPTCY REORGANIZATION AND ITS USE OF EUROPEAN FORMAT </p><p>MOBILE PHONE TECHNOLOGY. END COMMENT. </p><p>ALLEN </p><p></p></div>
