MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  03-21-13 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, PINS, PINR, CE, NO, JA, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  Sixth round of Sri Lanka-Tamil Tiger peace </p><p>talks set to wrap up on March 21 </p><p> </p><p>Ref:  (A) FBIS Reston Va DTG 200609Z Mar 03 </p><p> </p><p>-     (B) Colombo 462, and previous </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador E. Ashley Wills. </p><p>Reasons: 1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY:  The sixth round of GSL-Tamil Tiger </p><p>peace talks are set to wrap on March 21.  Mission will </p><p>provide the Department with the joint press statement </p><p>issued at the end of the talks as soon as it is </p><p>available.  Thus far, the talks have largely focused on </p><p>ceasefire modalities, development assistance, and long- </p><p>term political issues.  Despite initial expectations </p><p>that they would be contentious, the talks seem to have </p><p>been relatively constructive.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The sixth round of the Norwegian government- </p><p>facilitated peace talks between the Sri Lankan </p><p>government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam </p><p>(LTTE) are set to wrap up on March 21.  The talks, which </p><p>began on March 18, in the resort town of Hakone, Japan, </p><p>have, by most accounts, proceeded in a relatively smooth </p><p>and cordial fashion.  As with previous rounds, GSL and </p><p>LTTE negotiators are expected to release a joint press </p><p>statement on the outcome of their talks late March 21, </p><p>Japan time.  Mission will forward the press statement to </p><p>SA/INS as soon as it is available. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Per previous reporting (Ref B), the first three </p><p>days of talks have focused largely on ceasefire </p><p>modalities, development assistance, and long-term </p><p>political issues.  The LTTE used the first day of the </p><p>talks (March 18) to condemn the March 10 sinking of one </p><p>its resupply ships by the Sri Lanka Navy (see Ref B re </p><p>the LTTE\'s position re this incident).  In discussing </p><p>the March 10 incident, the two sides also reviewed </p><p>possible ways to strengthen the February 2002 ceasefire </p><p>agreement.  The second day of talks (March 19) focused </p><p>on development assistance and human rights issues.  The </p><p>development assistance discussion dealt with </p><p>resettlement of displaced persons, and administrative </p><p>and financial matters related to the funneling of </p><p>assistance to the war-torn north and east.  Late on the </p><p>second day, Ian Martin, a former official of Amnesty </p><p>International, presented a human rights "road map" to </p><p>the negotiators.  There was no agreement on the road </p><p>map, which focuses largely on issues related to the </p><p>LTTE, but the two sides agreed to continue to discuss </p><p>it. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) In the meantime, the focus of the third day of </p><p>talks (March 20) reportedly shifted to long-term </p><p>political issues.  During a meeting with the Ambassador </p><p>(focusing mainly on Iraq), Prime Minister Ranil </p><p>Wickremesinghe stated that the GSL proposed an outline </p><p>regarding long-term political issues to the Tigers. </p><p>(Note:  The PM was not clear on the exact nature of the </p><p>GSL\'s proposal, but it presumably involved federalism </p><p>ideas for the north/east.)  The LTTE did not respond </p><p>immediately, but promised to review the proposal. </p><p>Wickremesinghe expressed his hope that some sort of </p><p>outline re political issues will be ready by the time of </p><p>the June donor\'s conference in Tokyo. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U)  (((Note:  On March 21 a number of articles </p><p>appeared in the local press expressing concern that the </p><p>June donor\'s conference could be overshadowed by events </p><p>in Iraq.  In this regard, Ref A reports that Japan\'s </p><p>Special Advisor for Sri Lanka Akashi stated that "the </p><p>war against Iraq could cause considerable damage to the </p><p>economy of Sri Lanka and also take away from the </p><p>international attention from the Norwegian-led peace </p><p>bid."))) </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) COMMENT:  Despite initial fears that the sixth </p><p>round of talks would be contentious, all indications are </p><p>that the talks went smoothly and were carried out in a </p><p>cordial manner.  It appears that the LTTE did not want </p><p>to give any ammunition to those who oppose the GSL and </p><p>the peace process in the south.  There is also </p><p>speculation that the LTTE, in behaving well at the </p><p>talks, may be catering to the international community in </p><p>the expectation that it (the LTTE) will receive a great </p><p>deal of aid during the June donor\'s conference.  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
