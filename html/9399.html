<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 001437 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PDPA FOR DALTON, MITCHELL AND SIMS </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION PRESIDENT BUSH\'S VISIT TO AFRICA; </p><p>HARARE </p><p> </p><p>  1.   President George W. Bush\'s visit to five nations in </p><p>      Africa remains a sizzling issue in the leading </p><p>      newspapers in Zimbabwe.  An epigrammatic sample of </p><p>      some of the articles, op-ed and opinion pieces </p><p>      follow: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   Under headline "Cyclone Bush hits Africa" the </p><p>      July 13 edition of the independent weekly "The Daily </p><p>      News On Sunday" carried the following opinion piece </p><p>      by Barnabas Thondhlana, Deputy Editor, under his </p><p>      column "Thodhlana on Sunday" on page 13: </p><p> </p><p>      "Cyclone Bush has come and gone, leaving in its wake </p><p>      the gnashing of teeth. . .!  The last time a high- </p><p>      profile American government official was in this </p><p>      part of the world, this resulted in change. . .Given </p><p>      the hegemonic position of the U. S., it is not a </p><p>      minor thing to have the President of the most </p><p>      powerful country in the world paying a visit to </p><p>      Africa.  The visit may be a turning point for the </p><p>      whole of Africa and not a threat.  It gives Africa a </p><p>      chance to re-organize our priorities, and does not </p><p>      have to be a win-lose situation.  This is a win-win </p><p>      situation.  Unless you have something to hide.  `If </p><p>      Mr. Bush is coming to seek cooperation, then he is </p><p>      welcome, but if he is coming to dictate what we </p><p>      should do, then we will say: go back home, Yankee,\' </p><p>      Mugabe told his supporters in Chivi last weekend. </p><p>      We can shout `Yankee go home\' until we are hoarse, </p><p>      but we cannot ignore Bush.  Be afraid, be afraid, </p><p>      Cyclone Bush is here." </p><p> </p><p>  3.   Under headline "Bush leaves Africa a sober man" the </p><p>      July 13 edition of the government-controlled weekly </p><p>      "The Sunday Mail" carried the following article by </p><p>      Munyaradzi Huni, Political Editor, on page 9: </p><p> </p><p>      ". . .One just had to follow the Texan as he </p><p>      traveled from Senegal, South Africa, Botswana, </p><p>      Uganda and Nigeria to see how sober Mr. Bush was </p><p>      getting as he came face to face with the stunning </p><p>      realities in Africa. . .Despite the excitement, </p><p>      there are two things that are certain to happen </p><p>      after the Texan\'s visit.  One - This trip to Africa </p><p>      by Mr. Bush will definitely force America to re- </p><p>      think and re-shape its foreign policy towards </p><p>      Africa.  Two - This trip will definitely open up the </p><p>      eyes of the MDC leadership and make them realize </p><p>      that it\'s a waste of time to think Britain and </p><p>      America will smuggle them into power.  The game has </p><p>      to be played at home, and here in Zimbabwe. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>  4.   Under headline "United States foreign policy a threat </p><p>      to American security" the same newspaper carried the </p><p>      following opinion piece by Dr. Muqtedar Khan, a visiting </p><p>      fellow at the Brookings Institution\'s Saban Center for </p><p>      Middle East Policy, on page 9: </p><p> </p><p>      "The world is becoming anti-American.  Not only do </p><p>      most people across the planet look upon the U. S. </p><p>      with disfavor, they also dislike President George W. </p><p>      Bush, who is not the most popular leader even in </p><p>      America where British Prime Minister Tony Blair is </p><p>      more trusted and admired.  More and more people are </p><p>      less keen on co-operating with the U. S. in foreign </p><p>      policy or in the war on terror.  Growing anti- </p><p>      Americanism will not only undermine the war on </p><p>      terror, but its extreme manifestations in the Muslim </p><p>      world is attracting new and numerous recruits to the </p><p>      ranks of Al-Qaeda and their associates.  Experts are </p><p>      in agreement that the primary reason why people now </p><p>      hate America is American foreign policy.  Its </p><p>      exclusively self-regarding outlook, its arrogant </p><p>      unilateralism, its unwise and untrustworthy rhetoric </p><p>      and its beleaguered posture, is alienating. . </p><p>      .Rather than ensuring American security, it seems </p><p>      that American foreign policy, particularly the </p><p>      invasion and now occupation of Iraq, have created </p><p>      conditions which put the U. S. and its interests at </p><p>      greater risk.  President Bush is surrounded by </p><p>      policy hawks that view September 11 as an </p><p>      opportunity to reassert the prerogatives of the </p><p>      American Empire through unilateral use of force. </p><p>      They wish to reshape the world to perpetuate </p><p>      America\'s imperial aspirations.  Unfortunately for </p><p>      them the world is unwilling to co-operate.  The </p><p>      harder they push the more resentment they will </p><p>      generate and the more difficult it will become to </p><p>      save the empire and its interests." </p><p> </p><p>  5.   Under headline "President Bush\'s sudden change leaves </p><p>      MDC in a quandary" the government-controlled Bulawayo-based </p><p>      weekly "Sunday News" (07/13) carried the following news </p><p>      analysis on page 10: </p><p> </p><p>      "The sudden `climb-down\' by U. S. President Mr. </p><p>      George W. Bush from a hard-line stance against </p><p>      Zimbabwe to an attitude of constructive engagement </p><p>      after he met South African leader Mr. Thabo Mbeki. . </p><p>      .has left the opposition MDC in a quandary. . .The </p><p>      MDC and its media mouthpieces were praying that Mr. </p><p>      Bush would effect `regime change\' in Zimbabwe and </p><p>      hand over power to Mr. Tsvangirai, who has been </p><p>      accused of being a puppet of imperialists.  But Mr. </p><p>      Tsvangirai\'s hopes were dashed when Mr. Bush emerged </p><p>      from talks with Mr. Mbeki on Wednesday.  The </p><p>      American leader clearly said he is of `one mind\' </p><p>      with Mr. Mbeki on the issue of Zimbabwe. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>  6.   Under headline "Dishonest broker or politically </p><p>      broke?" the July 12 edition of "The Saturday Herald" </p><p>      carried the following op-ed by Nathaniel Manheru, under his </p><p>      column "The Other Side": </p><p> </p><p>      "The lot of puppets is a hard and unenviable one. </p><p>      They have to keep guessing the master\'s next move. </p><p>      And where the master is `a Texan idiot,\' unable `to </p><p>      think properly,\' one mercurially given to sudden </p><p>      shifts and turns, the guessing game can be </p><p>      insuperably hard. . .Unfortunately for Tsvangirai, </p><p>      his political master for once thought `properly\' </p><p>      and, without beating about the bush, told the world </p><p>      that Mbeki is `an honest broker,\' the `point man\' on </p><p>      Zimbabwe who is `working very hard\' and `making good </p><p>      progress.\'  Boom! The curtains falls and the day </p><p>      darkens. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>  7.   Under headline "What are the consequences of Bush\'s </p><p>      safari?" the July 12 edition of the government- </p><p>      controlled daily "Chronicle" carried the following </p><p>      op-ed by Dr. Godfrey Chokowore, under his regular </p><p>      column "Perspective" on page 4: </p><p> </p><p>      ". . .In conclusion it must be accepted that while </p><p>      Zimbabwe and Africa in the final analysis welcome </p><p>      the United States President George W. Bush as a </p><p>      world statesman, Zimbabwe and Africa should equally </p><p>      remind him that the potential of the U. S. A. to </p><p>      make the world a better place to live in, rests on </p><p>      its obligation to respect the historical reality of </p><p>      other countries, cooperation and complete </p><p>      elimination of unilateralistic practices in its </p><p>      foreign policy." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
