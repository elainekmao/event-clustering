SUMMARY:  SECRETARY POWELL\'S VISIT TO THE REGION, THE ONGOING </p><p>RECONSTRUCTION OF IRAQ, AND THE ROADMAP DOMINATED COVERAGE IN UAE </p><p>PRINT AND ELECTRONIC MEDIA.  AN "AL BAYAN" EDITORIAL COMMENTED ON </p><p>SECRETARY POWELL\'S VISIT TO THE REGION, LABELING THE OPTIMISM </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>SURROUNDING THE VISIT AS "UNJUSTIFIED."  AN "AL ITTIHAD" </p><p>EDITORIAL URGED PRESIDENT BUSH TO ESTABLISH A SOLID FOUNDATION </p><p>FOR A SETTLEMENT OF THE MIDDLE EAST CONFLICT BEFORE THE END OF </p><p>HIS TERM.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SHARJAH-BASED PAN-ARAB DAILY "AL KHALEEJ" AND SISTER ENGLISH- </p><p>LANGUAGE DAILY "GULF TODAY" CONDUCTED AN INTERVIEW WITH U.S. </p><p>AMBASSADOR TO THE UAE, MARCELLE WAHBA, AT THE U.S. EMBASSY IN ABU </p><p>DHABI.  BOTH "AL KHALEEJ" AND "GULF TODAY" PUBLISHED THE </p><p>TRANSCRIPT FULL-PAGE, IN ITS ENTIRETY, AND IN A Q & A FORMAT.  IN </p><p>THE INTERVIEW, AMBASSADOR WAHBA DISCUSSED THE ROADMAP, THE </p><p>RECONSTRUCTION OF IRAQ, AND U.S. RELATIONS WITH SYRIA, IRAN, AND </p><p>THE UN.  HEADLINES INCLUDED: </p><p> </p><p>--"NEXT STEP IS THE ROADMAP; SYRIAN ROLE VITAL: WAHBA" (GULF </p><p>TODAY) </p><p>--"US FOCUS IS NOW ON THE PEACE ROADMAP" (GULF TODAY) </p><p>--"THE ROADMAP IS OUR NEXT STEP AND WILL NOT BE CHANGED OR </p><p>MODIFIED" (AL KHALEEJ) </p><p>--"AMERICA LOOKS FOR A POSITIVE, UNOBSTRUCTIVE ROLE FROM </p><p>DAMASCUS" (AL KHALEEJ) </p><p>--"IRAQIS SHOULD RULE THEIR COUNTRY, AND THE UNITY OF IRAQ IS OUR </p><p>TOP PRIORITY" (AL KHALEEJ) </p><p> </p><p>3.  COMMENTING ON ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER ARIEL SHARON\'S ATTITUDE </p><p>TOWARDS THE CONTINUATION OF NEGOTIATIONS WITH SYRIA, "AL KHALEEJ" </p><p>EDITORIALIZED 5/10: </p><p> </p><p>"... SHARON IS NOT IN A HURRY TO START NEGOTIATIONS WITH SYRIA, </p><p>SINCE THE REGIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES, THE AMERICAN OCCUPATION OF </p><p>IRAQ, ARAB CONCESSIONS, AND THE UNLIMITED AMERICAN SUPPORT FOR </p><p>HIS ADMINISTRATION AND ITS AGGRESSIVE POLICIES ARE ALL REASONS </p><p>THAT ENCOURAGE HIM TO PLACE A STICK IN THE WHEELS TO STOP ANY </p><p>ATTEMPT AT PEACE.  THAT IS WHY HE (SHARON) IS CONSIDERING </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS WITH SYRIA WITHOUT PRECONDITIONS ..." </p><p> </p><p>4.  COMMENTING ON THE OPTIMISM SURROUNDING SECRETARY OF STATE </p><p>COLIN POWELL\'S VISIT TO THE REGION, DUBAI-BASED BUSINESS-ORIENTED </p><p>ARABIC DAILY "AL-BAYAN" EDITORIALIZED 5/10: </p><p> </p><p>"... OPTIMISTS SHOULD BE REALISTIC IN DEALING WITH THIS VISIT AND </p><p>SHOULD NOT GIVE IT MORE CREDIT THAN IT DESERVES.  ISRAEL HAS NOT </p><p>MADE A STRATEGIC DECISION FOR PEACE AS AN OPTION IN DEALING WITH </p><p>THE ARAB WORLD." </p><p> </p><p>5.  URGING PRESIDENT BUSH TO TAKE DECISIVE ACTION ON THE MIDDLE </p><p>EAST PEACE PROCESS, ABU DHABI-BASED SEMI-GOVERNMENT "AL ITTIHAD" </p><p>EDITORIALIZED 5/10: </p><p> </p><p>"... WE KNOW THAT PRESIDENT BUSH, WHOSE TERM ENDS NEXT YEAR, WAS </p><p>ABLE TO SUCCEED IN BOTH AFGHANISTAN AND IRAQ, BUT THE LITTLE TIME </p><p>HE HAS LEFT FOR HIS CURRENT TERM MIGHT NOT GIVE HIM TIME TO MAKE </p><p>A DIFFERENCE IN A COMPLICATED CONFLICT SUCH AS THAT IN THE MIDDLE </p><p>EAST; HE COULD HOWEVER AT LEAST ESTABLISH A FOUNDATION FOR AN </p><p>ONGOING SETTLEMENT TO PROVIDE ALL THE PEOPLE OF THE REGION WITH </p><p>SECURITY, PEACE, AND ECONOMIC GROWTH.  HOWEVER, THIS MUST NOT BE </p><p>AT THE EXPENSE OF THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE AND THEIR RIGHT TO AN </p><p>INDEPENDENT COUNTRY." </p><p> </p><p>6.  REFERRING TO THE RECENT ATTACKS IN RIYADH AND ASSERTING THAT </p><p>TERRORISM IS SPREADING LIKE THE FLU IN THE MIDDLE EAST, "AL </p><p>ITTIHAD" EDITORIALIZED 5/09: </p><p> </p><p>"... EXTERMINATING THOSE (TERRORISTS) AND ERADICATING THEM ... IS </p><p>AN INTERNATIONAL AND HUMAN RESPONSIBILITY FOR ALL COUNTRIES AND </p><p>PEOPLE, SINCE THEY THREATEN EVERYONE AND DO NOT DIFFERENTIATE BY </p><p>SEX, RELIGION, COLOR OR LANGUAGE, AND THEY THREATEN SOULS, </p><p>PROPERTIES, AND CIVILIZATION IN ALL ITS ASPECTS.  THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL CAMPAIGN AGAINST TERRORISM SHOULD BECOME STRONGER </p><p>THAN IN THE PAST, AND ALL ORGANIZATIONS, GOVERNMENTS, AND EVEN </p><p>ORDINARY PEOPLE SHOULD COOPERATE TO STOP THIS DANGER AND REVEAL </p><p>ITS SOURCES IN ORDER TO EXTERMINATE IT FROM THE WHOLE WORLD." </p><p> </p><p>7.  UNDER THE HEADLINE "A MAP WITH NO ROAD," "AL KHALEEJ" </p><p>EDITORIALIZED 5/08: </p><p> </p><p>"... SHARON DOES NOT WANT A LEGAL ENTITY OR EVEN A REAL COUNTRY </p><p>FOR THE PALESTINIANS.  AT THE BEST, HE WANTS RACIST CAMPS LIKE </p><p>THE \'BANTUSTANS\' THAT WERE IN SOUTH AFRICA WHEN IT WAS RULED BY </p><p>APARTHEID OR TO BE OCCUPIED FOREVER WITHOUT RIGHTS.  THE LIKUD </p><p>CONFIRMED THEIR REJECTION ESTABLISHING A \'REPUBLIC OF PALESTINE,\' </p><p>WHICH MEANS THAT THE \'REPUBLIC\' OF THE ROADMAP WILL NEVER SEE THE </p><p>LIGHT OF DAY EXCEPT AS DEMANDED BY THE ZIONISTS ..." </p><p> </p><p>8.  CRITICIZING SADDAM HUSSEIN\'S REGIME, "AL ITTIHAD" </p><p>EDITORIALIZED 5/08: </p><p> </p><p>"... THE COLLAPSED REGIME DID NOT LEAVE ANY GOOD DEEDS THAT COULD </p><p>LEAD TO ANY SYMPATHY FOR IT, IT LEFT ONLY MISERABLE MEMORIES ... </p><p>IT LEFT THE GRAVES OF AS MANY VICTIMS AS THERE ARE PALM TREES IN </p><p>IRAQ, TORTURE DENS AS LONG AS THE TIGRIS AND EUPHRATES, AND </p><p>INNUMERABLE EXECUTION FIELDS ..." </p><p> </p><p>ALBRIGHT </p><p></p></div>
