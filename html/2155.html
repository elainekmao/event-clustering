<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HANOI 002914 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, ECON, VM, DPOL </p><p>SUBJECT:   VIETNAM:  NATIONAL ASSEMBLY CHAIRMAN SETS OUT </p><p>LEGISLATIVE AGENDA FOR 2002. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  SUMMARY:  AT A RECENT BRIEFING FOR THE DIPLOMATIC CORPS, MR. </p><p>VU MAO, CHAIRMAN, OFFICE OF THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY, SET OUT THE </p><p>NATIONAL ASSEMBLY\'S LEGISLATIVE AGENDA FOR 2002.  THE THREE MAJOR </p><p>TASKS OF THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY WILL BE: REVIEW OF THE ECONOMY AND </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  02914  01 OF 02  080046Z </p><p>APPROVAL OF THE FIVE YEAR PLAN; APPROVAL OF THE BUDGET; AND </p><p>AMENDMENTS TO THE CONSTITUTION.  THE NATIONAL ASSEMBY IS SET TO </p><p>CONVENE ON NOVEMBER 20 FOR THE NEXT SESSION.  SOME OF MAO\'S </p><p>COMMENTS WERE CLEARLY DESIGNED FOR HIS "WESTERN" AND DONOR- </p><p>COUNTRY AUDIENCE, BUT HE DID SHED SOME LIGHT ON CURRENT </p><p>VIETNAMESE PRIORITIES.   END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>ECONOMY, BUDGET & CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM </p><p> </p><p>2.  BY THE END OF 2001, THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY WILL NEED TO REVIEW </p><p>THE ECONOMY AND SET TASKS FOR 2002, INCLUDING APPROVAL OF THE </p><p>BUDGET AND TARGETS FOR GROWTH RATE, INFLATION, ETC.   THE </p><p>NATIONAL ASSEMBLY WILL ALSO NEED TO LOOK AT THE CONSTITUTION IN </p><p>TERMS OF NECESSARY REVISIONS TO MAKE CLEAR THAT THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>ENCOURAGES "ALL ECONOMIC PLAYERS", ACCORDING TO MAO. </p><p> </p><p>3.  MAO CITED DIFFICULTIES THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS HAVING IN </p><p>MOVING FROM A CENTRAL PLANNED SYSTEM TO MORE MARKET BASED AND </p><p>NOTED THAT THE PROBLEMS WILL ONLY GET WORSE IF NOT ADDRESSED. </p><p>THERE CONTINUES TO BE SERIOUS CONFUSION BETWEEN "GOVERNMENT </p><p>MANAGEMENT" AND "BUSINESS MANAGEMENT."  THE MINISTRIES ARE OFTEN </p><p>SO BUSY WORKING ON MANAGING THEIR STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISES THAT </p><p>THEY NEGLECT THEIR "GOVERNANCE DUTIES" HE CHARGED. </p><p> </p><p>4.  THE WORK OF THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY REGARDING CONSTITUTIONAL </p><p>REVISIONS WILL FOCUS ON: ADMINISTRATIVE REFORM ISSUES; </p><p>ADMINISTRATION OF THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY; AND ELECTIONS. </p><p>ADMINISTRATIVE REFORM WILL INCLUDE ISSUES RELATED TO COURTS AND </p><p>PROSECUTORY PROCESS (BY END 2002), LOCAL GOVERNMENT RULES, AND </p><p>RULES REGARDING THE PEOPLE\'S COUNCILS (BY END 2004). </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02914  01 OF 02  080046Z </p><p>5.  MAO DETAILED THE NEED TO REVISE THE CONSTITUTION (SEPTEL), </p><p>NOTING THAT ALTHOUGH THE PROCESS OF REFORM HAS BEEN ONGOING FOR </p><p>15 YEARS, PROBLEMS AND CHALLENGES REMAIN.  THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>ADMINISTRATION CANNOT MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE NATION.  IN </p><p>PARTICULAR, THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY NEEDS ADDITIONAL ADMINISTRATIVE </p><p>SUPPORT, ESPECIALLY SINCE IT STARTED TO TELEVISE DEBATES.  FOR </p><p>THE FIRST TIME, THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY HAS TO RESPOND TO QUESTIONS </p><p>FROM THE PEOPLE, AND THE GOVERNMENT MUST RESPOND TO QUESTIONS </p><p>FROM THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY. </p><p> </p><p>6.  ACCORDING TO MAO, THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY CURRENTLY DOES NOT </p><p>HAVE THE DEPTH OR BREADTH OF TALENT TO DRAFT OR APPROVE </p><p>SUFFICIENT LAWS TO MEET THE NEEDS OF A "RULES-BASED" GOVERNMENT. </p><p>STAFF LEVELS FOR THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY ARE LOW - ONLY 300 </p><p>STAFFERS COMPARED WITH 3000 FOR THE JAPANESE DIET - AND NOW THE </p><p>NATIONAL ASSEMBLY IS FACING DOWNSIZING DEMANDS MADE OF ALL </p><p>GOVERNMENT OFFICES.  MOST MEMBERS SERVE ONLY ON A PART-TIME BASIS </p><p>AND THE "QUALITY" OF MEMBERS IS HIGHLY UNEVEN ACCORDING TO MAO. </p><p>HE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY RANKS INCREASE TO 500 </p><p>FROM 450 MEMBERS AND TO "BETTER REPRESENT THE 60 PROVINCES, </p><p>MINORITIES, AND WOMEN." </p><p> </p><p>7. THERE IS ALSO AN INTERNAL DEBATE ON THE APPROACH NEW LAWS </p><p>SHOULD TAKE. THAT IS, SHOULD LAWS ALLOW ALL ACTIVITIES IN AN AREA </p><p>EXCEPT THOSE WHICH ARE SPECIFICALLY PROHIBITED?  OR SHOULD LAWS </p><p>PROHIBIT ALL ACTIVITIES EXCEPT THOSE WHICH ARE SPECIFICALLY </p><p>ALLOWED?   (N.B.  THIS IS THE "NEGATIVE LIST" VS "POSITIVE LIST" </p><p>DEBATE.)  MAO NOTED THAT THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY CAN ONLY PASS </p><p>ABOUT 10 LAWS A YEAR UNDER THE CURRENT RULES BECAUSE EACH </p><p>INDIVIDUAL ARTICLE OF EACH LAW MUST BE DISCUSSED.  ADDITIONALLY, </p><p>THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY LACKS EXPERIENCED STAFF FOR DRAFTING LAWS </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02914  01 OF 02  080046Z </p><p>SO THE QUALITY OF LEGISLATION IS OFTEN POOR, REQUIRING ADDITIONAL </p><p>DEBATE. (N.B. AT PRESENT, GOVERNMENT AGENCIES DRAFT LEGISLATION </p><p>WITH LITTLE TO NO CONSULTATION BETWEEN MINISTRIES.) </p><p> </p><p>8.  REGARDING REFORM OF THE COURTS AND PROSECUTORY PROCESS, THE </p><p>GOAL OF THE SYSTEM SHOULD BE TO IMPLEMENT JUSTICE, BUT MANY CASES </p><p>RESULT IN UNFAIR JUDGEMENTS, MAO SAID.  THERE IS A NEED TO MAKE </p><p>COURTS MORE ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR DECISIONS.  A VIETNAM WHERE </p><p>THERE IS RULE OF LAW AND "DEMOCRACY" IS THE GOAL. HOWEVER, IN </p><p>CERTAIN CASES, THERE ARE PROBLEMS WITH VIOLATIONS OF CITIZENS\' </p><p>RIGHTS.  IN ADDITION, SOME PUBLIC EMPLOYEES EXPECT BRIBES TO DO </p><p>THEIR JOBS OR TAKE PAYMENT TO ISSUE WAIVERS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF </p><p>GAPS IN THE LAW. TO DEAL WITH THESE PROBLEMS, VIETNAM NEEDS TO </p><p>CHANGE THE LEGAL ENVIRONMENT AS WELL AS CHANGE ATTITUDES AMONG </p><p>PUBLIC SERVANTS. </p><p> </p><p>9.   MAO ALSO DISCUSSED THE NEED TO CLARIFY THE RESPONSIBILITIES </p><p>OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS VS CENTRAL GOVERNMENT AND TO LOOK AT GREATER </p><p>AUTONOMY FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS.  HE NOTED THAT IN VIETNAM, THE </p><p>CENTRAL GOVERNMENT IS INVOLVED IN ALL AREAS - BUT THAT THERE </p><p>NEEDS TO BE GREATER DECENTRALIZATION IN AREAS LIKE EDUCATION AND </p><p>SOCIAL SERVICES.  LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE COMPLAINING AND THE </p><p>NATIONAL ASSEMBLY NEEDS TO LOOK AT WAYS TO EMPOWER THEM AS WELL </p><p>AS WAYS TO IMPROVE THE "QUALITY" OF LOCAL OFFICIALS. </p><p> </p><p>10. REGARDING GREATER AUTONOMY FOR HO CHI MINH CITY, MAO NOTED </p><p>THAT IN VIETNAM, GOVERNMENT ADMINISTRATION WORKS ON 4 LEVELS - </p><p>CENTRAL, PROVINCIAL, DISTRICT, AND COMMUNE. THE HCMC DEBATE IS </p><p>ABOUT THE DISTRICT LEVEL ADMINISTRATION - SHOULD IT CONTINUE TO </p><p>EXIST AND IF SO, IN WHAT AREAS?  HCMC HAS PROPOSED REMOVING THE </p><p>PEOPLE\'S COUNCIL AT THE DISTRICT LEVEL BECAUSE THE NUMEROUS </p><p>DIFFERENT COUNCILS PREVENT EFFECTIVE GOVERNANCE OF HCMC AS A </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  02914  02 OF 02  080046Z </p><p>SINGLE CITY.  MAO ARGUED THAT THE DISTRICT LEVEL WAS STILL </p><p>REQUIRED IN RURAL AREAS AND THE PROPOSAL WAS CONTRARY TO THE </p><p>EXISTING CONSTITUTION.  (N.B.  HE DIDN\'T ADDRESS WHETHER THE </p><p>NATIONAL ASSEMBLY WILL ADDRESS THIS ISSUE SPECIFICALLY WHEN </p><p>CONSIDERING AMENDMENTS TO THE CONSTITUTION.) </p><p> </p><p>11.   MAO  CONCLUDED  HIS  TALK WITH  AN  APPEAL  TO  DONORS  FOR </p><p>INCREASED   TRAINING  AND  TECHINICAL  ASSISTANCE  FOR   NATIONAL </p><p>ASSEMBLY  MEMBERS AND STAFF IN ORDER TO IMPROVE  THE  QUALITY  OF </p><p>GOVERNANCE IN VIETNAM.  HE NOTED THAT MOST ASSISTANCE GOES TO THE </p><p>CENTRAL  GOVERNMENT  -  NOT  TO  THE  NATIONAL  ASSEMBLY  OR  THE </p><p>JUDICIARY  BRANCH, WHICH ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR EFFECTING CHANGE  IN </p><p>VIETNAM. </p><p> </p><p>12.  COMMENT: SOME OF MAO\'S COMMENTS WERE CLEARLY DESIGNED FOR </p><p>HIS "WESTERN" AND DONOR-COUNTRY AUDIENCE - LIKE INCREASING THE </p><p>PARTICIPATION OF MINORITIES AND WOMEN IN THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY - </p><p>BUT HE DID SHED SOME LIGHT ON CURRENT VIETNAMESE PRIORITIES. </p><p>INTERESTINGLY, HE DID NOT ONCE MENTION THE RATIFICATION OF THE </p><p>BTA AS A PRIORITY FOR THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY, WHEN IN FACT MANY </p><p>OTHERS, INCLUDING TOP PARTY LEADERS, GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND THE </p><p>PRESS, HAVE EMPHASIZED IT AS A NUMBER ONE PRIORITY FOR THE </p><p>NATIONAL ASSEMBLY WHEN IT RECONVENES IN LATE NOVEMBER. </p><p>PORTER </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
