STATE 102827 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edmund J. Hull, for Reasons 1.5 (b,c,d) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S/NF)  On 6/21 Abdul Hakim al-Iryani, Advisor to Foreign </p><p>Minister Qirbi, asked for USG assistance in vetting the </p><p>asylum request of former Iraqi Ambassador to Azerbaijan, </p><p>Ghalib Abdu Husayn al-Tamimi, his wife, and their six </p><p>children.  PolOff delivered USG response provided by ORCA </p><p>(para 2) on June 25.  Iryani was pleased by the timeliness of </p><p>the reply, but felt the response lacked the decisiveness ROYG </p><p>requires.  He noted that this request is currently being </p><p>handled by the Yemeni Ambassador to Turkey.  In response, </p><p>PolOff re-affirmed the firm USG position that al-Tamimi </p><p>should not be granted asylum. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S/NF rel Yemen)  Begin text: </p><p> </p><p>Ghalib Abdu Husayn al-Tamimi has served as Iraqi Ambassador </p><p>to Azerbaijan in Baku since approximately 1998.  We also have </p><p>information that subject may also be an Iraqi Intelligence </p><p>Service Officer who worked as a torturer in the General </p><p>Security Directorate.  This information, however, has not </p><p>been confirmed.  Subject attended university in Moscow and </p><p>subsequently worked in Russia for several years as First </p><p>Secretary in Iraq\'s Moscow embassy from 1989-1993.  He was </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>part of an Iraqi commercial delegation that arrived in Moscow </p><p>to confer with a Russian team of negotiators in October 1994 </p><p>and also worked in the Iraqi Ministry of Foreign Affairs </p><p>Third Political Department.  He is in his late 40s or early </p><p>50s, married, and has six children.  The 2002 Azerbaijani </p><p>Diplomatic List showed Tamimi\'s wife as Afrah Tamimi.  He is </p><p>Shi\'a and speaks Russian fluently. </p><p> </p><p>End text. </p><p> </p><p>HULL </p><p></p></div>
