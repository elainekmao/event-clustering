JONES; REASON 1.5 (A, D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (S) Note on classification: Kuwait\'s extensive support for </p><p>U.S. and allied security forces in the country is extremely </p><p>sensitive domestically and within the region. </p><p>While all of the figures in the unclassified and the </p><p>sensitive but unclassified sections of this report are from </p><p>unclassified sources, the assembled data -- necessary to </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>portray to Congress the breadth of Kuwaiti support -- could </p><p>be misused.  Addressees should conform </p><p>strictly to classification guidelines in the distribution of </p><p>this information.  End note. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) POC for questions regarding this report is PolOff Gene </p><p>Del Bianco , 965-539-5307 ext. 2533 (office), 538-0282 (fax), </p><p>DelBiancoGJ2@state.gov.  Information in this report is </p><p>current as of December 15, 2002. </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>TEXT OF REPORT </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. GENERAL ASSESSMENT: </p><p> </p><p>A. IMPORTANT POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS </p><p> </p><p>A1. (S) Kuwait\'s strong commitment to shared U.S. security </p><p>objectives remained firm in 2002.  There was no diminution in </p><p>the Iraqi threat, which remains the GOK\'s number one concern. </p><p>   Kuwait provided critical support throughout 2002 for </p><p>Operation Southern Watch (OSW) and other AOR operations </p><p>including Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF).  Reliance on U.S. </p><p>security forces remained key to Kuwaiti national security. </p><p>Kuwaitis continue to believe that their security and freedom </p><p>as a nation depend on continued U.S. presence in the Gulf and </p><p>in Kuwait. </p><p> </p><p>A2. (C) The continued violence between the Israelis and </p><p>Palestinians remains a significant concern of the GOK. </p><p>Although support for U.S. military cooperation remained as </p><p>strong as ever, the GOK did take steps to downplay media </p><p>spotlighting of the security relationship.  Behind the </p><p>scenes, however, Kuwait offered unstinting support for the </p><p>U.S. military, particularly in the areas of force protection </p><p>and military assets allocation. </p><p> </p><p>A3. (SBU) Kuwait is participating in the GCC Mutual Defense </p><p>Agreement. </p><p> </p><p>A4. (U) Strong oil prices in 2002 generated a significant GOK </p><p>budget surplus.  The official FY02 budget figure listed for </p><p>defense spending by the GOK Ministry of Defense is </p><p>569,193,000 Kuwaiti Dinar (KD) (USD 1.88 billion at </p><p>1KD=$3.3).  The overall GOK official national budget for FY02 </p><p>is 3,521,650,000 KD. (USD 11,621,445 billion at 1KD=$3.3). </p><p>GOK defense spending is approximately 16.16 percent of the </p><p>GOK FY02 national budget. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>B. MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS IN DEFENSE POLICY: </p><p>B1. (U) The GOK\'s support of the United States since the </p><p>September 11 attacks has been immediate and robust.  This </p><p>includes increased security for U.S. DOD and DOS </p><p>installations and personnel, approval for substantial </p><p>additional force deployments, and basing. </p><p> </p><p>B2. (SBU) The GOK has moved forward on four major Foreign </p><p>Military Sales (FMS) programs. </p><p> </p><p>B2.1 (SBU) A Letter of Acceptance (LOA) for 16 AH-64D Apache </p><p>helicopters and 8 Longbow Fire </p><p>Control Radars was signed by the GOK on 31 August, 2002.  The </p><p>request also embraces the Total Package Approach (TPA) for </p><p>program support.  Total package is estimated at nearly USD </p><p>1.2 billion. </p><p> </p><p>B2.2 (SBU) The GOK is expected to sign an LOA by April 2003 </p><p>for the 71 meter AEROSTAT system with TPS-63 radar.  The </p><p>total package is estimated at approximately $110 million. </p><p> </p><p>B2.3 (SBU) The GOK is expected to sign a Letter of Acceptance </p><p>(LOA) in early 2003 for F/A-18 AMRAAM purchase. The LOA </p><p>estimated value is $50m.  The LOA is for 80 AMRAAM </p><p>AIM-120C-5.  In addition to missiles, the purchase will </p><p>provide related test equipment to the Kuwait Air Force in </p><p>support of the F/A-18 program. </p><p> </p><p>B2.4 (SBU) Kuwait is also considering the purchase of surface </p><p>launched AMRAAM, the estimated program value is $333 million. </p><p> </p><p>B3. (S) Kuwait has allowed U.S. forces to utilize the </p><p>following areas and facilities. </p><p> </p><p>B3.1 (S) Camp Doha. The Coalition Forces Land Component </p><p>Command (CFLCC) Headquarters is based at Camp Doha as well as </p><p>approximately 6,200 Military and civilian personnel and </p><p>associated equipment. </p><p> </p><p>B3.2 (S) Camp Arifjan. Newly constructed for and occupied by </p><p>U.S. Military forces, Camp Arifjan supports theater logistics </p><p>requirements and currently houses 1,646 Military and civilian </p><p>personnel. </p><p> </p><p>B3.3 (S) Commando Camp. A portion of the Kuwaiti Commando </p><p>Camp has been recently occupied by the Headquarters of the </p><p>1st Marine Expeditionary Force (I MEF). The camp currently </p><p>houses approximately 1,000 Marines. </p><p> </p><p>B3.4 (S) Kuwait Navy Base (KNB). KNB is currently being </p><p>enhanced to provide a Joint Logistics Over the Shore (JLOTS) </p><p>capability for U.S. forces. There are approximately 50 </p><p>personnel at KNB. </p><p> </p><p>B3.5 (S) Ahmed Al-Jaber Air Base is home to the USAF 332nd </p><p>Air Expeditionary Wing (AEW) and approximately 2,400 U.S. </p><p>Military personnel. </p><p> </p><p>B3.6 (S) Ali Al-Salem Air Base is home to the USAF 386th AEW </p><p>and 1,600 U.S. Military and civilian personnel, and 491 </p><p>British Royal Air Force Personnel. </p><p> </p><p>B3.7 (S) Desert Camps. There are currently five desert camps </p><p>that are used by CFLCC forces for basing and support. Kuwait </p><p>has approved plans to establish more camps as necessary in </p><p>support of the defense of Kuwait. </p><p> </p><p>B3.8 (SBU) Desert Training Areas. U.S. forces have access to </p><p>approximately 25% of Kuwait,s total land area for training, </p><p>including areas for maneuver and live-fire training. In </p><p>addition, Kuwait has recently made these areas off-limits to </p><p>its own citizens (unless on official business) in order to </p><p>increase security for U.S. Military forces. </p><p> </p><p>B4. (S) Kuwait was one of the few regional countries to allow </p><p>U.S. Air Force strike aircraft to launch offensive operations </p><p>into Afghanistan.  The GOK approved all OEF-related requests. </p><p> </p><p>B5. (S) The GOK agreed to the designation of the Kuwait Armed </p><p>Forces Hospital (KAFH) as a casualty reception facility in </p><p>support of OEF.  The CFLCC has deployed a 120-person Combat </p><p>Support Hospital with equipment to staff specific wards and </p><p>specialty clinics </p><p>at KAFH to provide Level III medical capabilities in </p><p>combination with the Kuwaiti staff. </p><p> </p><p>B6. (S) The extent of U.S. military deployments to Kuwait is </p><p>unparalleled in the region.  The normally robust Kuwait-U.S. </p><p>military bilateral exercise program was substantially reduced </p><p>earlier in 2002 due to U.S. operational commitments. </p><p>However, coalition training continued with the Intrinsic </p><p>Action Task Force, Patriot units, Exercise Lucky Sentinel, </p><p>and various small-unit training collaborations. Currently, </p><p>Exercise INTERNAL LOOK (IL)  is being held in Kuwait and </p><p>elsewhere in the region. The exercise brings the tactical </p><p>headquarters of 5th Corps (V Corps), 3rd Infantry Division, </p><p>and I MEF to conduct a computer simulation of war in the </p><p>region.  The GOK Ministry of Defense is taking part as </p><p>appropriate in some aspects of the exercise. </p><p> </p><p>B7. (S) As of December 15, U.S. troops in-country number </p><p>approximately 16,630.  The personnel are distributed as </p><p>follows: </p><p> </p><p>(1) U.S. Army: 11,000. </p><p> </p><p>--(S) CFLCC:  The OEF Coalition Forces Land Component Command </p><p>(CFLCC) comprises the U.S. Army Central Command (ARCENT) </p><p>headquarters in Kuwait.  It was activated on November 20, </p><p>2001 at Camp Doha, Kuwait.  Currently numbering over 850 </p><p>personnel, the CFLCC controls all land operations in the </p><p>CENTCOM Area of Responsibility with the exception of </p><p>coalition joint operations area Afghanistan (CJOA AFG).  It </p><p>also has responsibility for Operation Desert Spring (ODS) in </p><p>Kuwait. </p><p> </p><p>--(S) Operation Desert Spring (ODS)is the permanent presence </p><p>of a mechanized/armored task force of over 1200 soldiers and </p><p>a U.S. Army Special Forces Company.  For OEF, U.S. Central </p><p>Command (CENTCOM) also deployed an additional Brigade Combat </p><p>Team of approximately  2,200 soldiers.  Deployment numbers </p><p>continue to increase as additional forces are added to the </p><p>CJFLCC staff and BCT. </p><p> </p><p>--(S) Other Army Forces in Kuwait include: The 377th Theater </p><p>Support Command (TSC)currently numbering 432 personnel at </p><p>Camp Arifjan.  The TSC provides logistical support and </p><p>reception, staging and onward movement and integration of </p><p>component forces arriving in theater; an Aviation Brigade </p><p>Headquarters, an Attack Aviation Battalion, and an Aviation </p><p>Maintenance Battalion are also currently stationed in Kuwait. </p><p> Current Army aviation assets in country include, 32 AH-64 </p><p>Apache attack helicopters, and 13 UH-60 Blackhawks.  The </p><p>513th Military Intelligence Brigade, consisting of 450 </p><p>personnel; three Patriot air defense batteries with a 50 </p><p>soldier infantry detachment that provides security;  two </p><p>logistics support vessels; and a Multiple Launcher Rocket </p><p>System (MLRS) field artillery battalion. Other Army forces </p><p>include: engineer, chemical, military police, transportation, </p><p>signal, and public affairs units. </p><p> </p><p>(2) U.S. Air Force: 4,000. </p><p> </p><p>-- (S) Operation Southern Watch (OSW) continues to enforce </p><p>the southern no-fly zone in Iraq, flying from Ahmed Al-Jaber </p><p>AB (332nd Air Expeditionary Wing) and Ali Al-Salem AB (386th </p><p>AEW). The 332nd AEW currently includes 24 strike aircraft </p><p>(F-16 and A-10) and various Combat Search and Rescue </p><p>packages. The 386th AEG includes various lift aircraft, 6 </p><p>Predator unmanned aerial vehicles and the Command and </p><p>Reporting Center (CRC) for command and control and early </p><p>warning.  It is tied to the Kuwait Air Operations Center for </p><p>integrated air defense capability involving three American </p><p>and five Kuwaiti Patriot Batteries. </p><p> </p><p>-- (S) Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) continues to employ </p><p>strike aircraft from the 332nd AEW at Al-Jaber AB in order to </p><p>conduct strike operations in Afghanistan, including currently </p><p>F-16CG aircraft.  Intra-theater lift (C-130\'s and </p><p>occasionally C-17\'s) are based at Al-Salem </p><p>AB, and some Predator UAV flights into Afghanistan are </p><p>controlled by the 386th AEW via satellite link-up. </p><p> </p><p>(3) U.S. Navy Special Warfare: 130. </p><p> </p><p>-- (S) There are approximately 130 SEAL personnel at Camp </p><p>Doha, with 8 boats, stationed at the Kuwait Naval Base in </p><p>support of Multi-national Maritime Interdiction Operations </p><p>(MIO).  The SEAL units conduct non-compliant boardings of </p><p>vessels smuggling Iraqi oil, in support of </p><p>United Nations Security Council Resolutions on Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>(4) U.S. Marine Corps: Currently 1,500. </p><p> </p><p>-- (S) I MEF FWD Tactical Command Post - currently occupying </p><p>Commando Camp and participating in Exercise INTERNAL LOOK. </p><p> </p><p>-- (S) CENTCOM\'s Coalition Joint Task Force - Consequence </p><p>Management (CJTF-CM) is headquartered at Camp Doha with an </p><p>interagency staff and an initial reaction force </p><p>comprising a Marine Amphibious Group Task Force headquarters </p><p>as well as specialist units from the USMC and the Czech and </p><p>German Armed Forces.  CJTF-CM conducts combined and joint </p><p>consequence management operations in support of the </p><p>Department of State in its response to a host nation request </p><p>for help in reducing the effects of a known or suspected </p><p>deliberate or inadvertent release of chemical, biological, </p><p>radiological or nuclear contamination, or the use of high </p><p>explosives (CBRN-E) within CENTCOM\'s area of responsibility. </p><p> </p><p>C. GRANT AID, PEACEKEEPING, HUMANITARIAN OPERATIONS, AND </p><p>COUNTERPROLIFERATION AND NUCLEAR THREAT REDUCTION: </p><p> </p><p>(U) Using its C-130 airlift capabilities, the GOK delivered </p><p>multiple batches of humanitarian aid items for Afghan </p><p>refugees.  The GOK also contributed USD 800,000 to U.S. </p><p>relief agencies after the terrorist attacks of September 11, </p><p>and the GOK and Kuwaiti citizens raised approximately USD </p><p>eight million for Afghan </p><p>refugees. </p><p> </p><p>D. HOST NATION\'S CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE WAR ON TERRORISM: </p><p> </p><p>(SBU) Given the nature of the threat posed by Iraq, the USG </p><p>did not ask the Kuwait Armed Forces to offer or contribute </p><p>forces to the OEF coalition.  However, Kuwait\'s in-kind </p><p>support has been significant.  The GOK has fully supported </p><p>all OEF requests.  This includes block over-flight and basing </p><p>clearances for aircraft, hospital support, and bed-down of </p><p>significant force deployments, doubling the U.S. military </p><p>footprint in-country.  Kuwait security forces have responded </p><p>to all requests for additional security measures to protect </p><p>U.S. government personnel and installations, working closely </p><p>with U.S. security officers on a number of force protection </p><p>initiatives, particularly following the October 8 terrorist </p><p>attack on Faylaka Island. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.
