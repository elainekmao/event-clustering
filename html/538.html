<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L RANGOON 05650 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/TB, NEA/INS, HA AND INM/AMB BORG </p><p>CINCPAC ALSO FOR FPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, PHUM, CH, IN, BM </p><p>SUBJECT: BURMA\'S LEADER EXUDES CONFIDENCE -- AND A </p><p>         SOFTER LINE </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  THE INDIAN AMBASSADOR TOLD CHARGE TODAY THAT HIS </p><p>FAREWELL MEETING WITH GENERAL THAN SHWE ON SEPTEMBER </p><p>17 HAD REINFORCED HIS SENSE THAT RANGOON\'S NEW HEAD </p><p>OF STATE IS SOMEWHAT SERIOUS ABOUT LIBERALIZING BURMA </p><p>-- AND ENCOUNTERING RESISTENCE ON THIS SCORE FROM </p><p>POWERFUL INTELLIGENCE CHIEF KHIN NYUNT.  ELABORATING, </p><p>HE CHARACTERIZED THAN SHWE AS "ASSIDUOUSLY PEDDLING A </p><p>SOFTER LINE" BOTH RE INDIAN-BURMESE RELATIONS AND </p><p>INTERNAL POLITICAL EVOLUTION.  THE GENERAL ADMITTED, </p><p>FOR EXAMPLE, THAT THE MILITARY "CANNOT STAY IN POWER </p><p>TOO LONG WITHOUT RISKING UNPOPULARITY" AND THAT </p><p>BURMA\'S "POOR ECONOMY WON\'T RECOVER WITHOUT FOREIGN </p><p>EXPERTISE AND INPUTS."  THAN SHWE ALSO VENTURED THAT </p><p>THE "FRACTIONING (SIC: FRAGMENTATION) OF BURMA CAN </p><p>ONLY BE AVOIDED IF THE PEOPLE ARE BROUGHT IN AND CAN </p><p>SHARE IN THE CAKE." </p><p> </p><p>3.  WHILE GENERAL THAN SHWE INTERLARDED THESE </p><p>ADMISSIONS WITH MORE CONVENTIONAL GOB RHETORIC ON THE </p><p>MILITARY\'S CONTINUING ROLE IN KEEPING THE COUNTRY </p><p>TOGETHER, HIS "LIBERAL" ADMISSIONS WENT WELL BEYOND </p><p>THE NORM -- EVEN FOR PRIVATE TALKS.  STRONGMAN KHIN </p><p>NYUNT -- WHO SAT IN BUT WAS STUDIOUSLY KEPT OUT OF </p><p>THE DISCOURSE BY THAN SHWE -- WAS CLEARLY </p><p>DISCOMFORTED BY ALL THIS CANDOR.  AT ONE POINT, THE </p><p>INTELLIGENCE CHIEF EVEN VIGOROUSLY NODDED HIS HEAD IN </p><p>DISAGREEMENT.  COMMENT:  DURING THAN SHWE\'S TALK WITH </p><p>THE JAPANESE AMBASSADOR SOME MONTHS BACK, THE </p><p>INTELLIGENCE CHIEF TWICE BROKE IN TO DISAGREE WITH </p><p>HIS BOSS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  DURING THE DISCUSSION OF INDIAN-BURMESE </p><p>RELATIONS, THAN SHWE CHARACTERIZED TIES AS "ON THE </p><p>IMPROVE" BUT THEN FAULTED NEW DELHI FOR SOURING THE </p><p>RELATIONSHIP IN THE FIRST PLACE, CHIEFLY BY ALLOWING </p><p>ALL INDIA RADIO TO RUN AMOK.  HOWEVER, HE CAREFULLY </p><p>BALANCED THIS "HISTORICAL" CRITICISM BY OBSERVING </p><p>THAT THE RECENT VISIT TO INDIA BY DEPUTY FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER AND REGIME INSIDER U AYE HAD GONE VERY </p><p>WELL.  LOOKING AHEAD, THAN SHWE HOPED THAT HIS </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER WOULD SOON GET AN INVITATION TO NEW </p><p>DELHI.  THE INDIAN AMBASSADOR RESPONDED BY NOTING </p><p>THAT FURTHER POLITICAL PROGRESS IN BURMA WOULD EASE </p><p>THE WAY FOR HIGH-LEVEL EXCHANGES. </p><p> </p><p>5.  TURNING TO THE PRC-BURMA NEXUS, THE INDIAN </p><p>AMBASSADOR VOICED HIS GOVERNMENT\'S CONCERN THAT CHINA </p><p>MAY BE ALLOWED TO BUILD A NAVAL BASE ON THE ANDAMAN </p><p>SEA COAST (SEPTEL HAS DETAILS).  THAN SHWE BRUSHED </p><p>AWAY THIS FEAR, NOTING THAT "BURMA LACKS THE MONEY </p><p>FOR ANY JOINT BUILDING OF A NAVAL BASE" AND </p><p>"CERTAINLY WON\'T ALLOW CHINA OR ANY FOREIGN POWER TO </p><p>HAVE A BASE HERE."  WHEN THE INDIAN AMBASSADOR </p><p>PURSUED PRC-BURMESE TIES FURTHER BY ASKING ABOUT THE </p><p>ARMS RELATIONSHIP, THE HEAD OF STATE OBSERVED THAT </p><p>"HIS COUNTRY HAD FEW ALTERNATIVES."  CLOSING THE </p><p>SUBJECT, HE TOLD THE INDIAN AMBASSADOR NOT TO WORRY </p><p>AS "BURMA IS ADEQUATELY CONCERNED ABOUT SOVERIGNTY </p><p>ISSUES."  COMMENT:  A WORLD-CLASS UNDERSTATEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>6.  GENERAL COMMENT:  THAN SHWE CONTINUES TO IMPRESS </p><p>US AS MORE INTERESTED IN PURSUING A LIBERAL COURSE </p><p>THAN EITHER HIS PREDECESSOR SAW MAUNG OR KHIN NYUNT, </p><p>AT LEAST BY BURMESE MILITARY STANDARDS.  (A VIEW </p><p>SHARED BY OTHER WESTERN EMBASSIES HERE.)  THOUGH THIS </p><p>HAS NOT LED TO AN OPEN SPLIT BETWEEN BURMA\'S TWO TOP </p><p>GUNS -- IN PART BECAUSE THE RULING GENERALS PERCEIVE </p><p>A STRONG NEED FOR A UNITED PUBLIC FRONT -- THERE ARE </p><p>QUASI-OVERT SIGNS OF FRICTION.  FOR EXAMPLE, KHIN </p><p>NYUNT RECENTLY TOOK THE UNUSUAL STEP OF COMPLAINING </p><p>TO THE THAI AMBASSADOR ABOUT THE GOB\'S (READ THAN </p><p>SHWE\'S) ADMISSION TO HOLDING POLITICAL PRISONERS. </p><p>THIS ACTION, THE STRONGMAN CLAIMED, WAS CLEARED BY </p><p>NEITHER MOFA NOR HIMSELF. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HUDDLE </p><p></p></div>
