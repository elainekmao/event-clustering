<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 002070 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/02/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, AMGT, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZ01: JORDANIAN FSNS AND THE WAR NEXT DOOR </p><p> </p><p>REF: SANAA 607 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMBASSADOR EDWARD W. GNEHM, REASONS 1.5 B AND D </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary:  As in Sanaa (reftel), the FSNs at the </p><p>U.S. Mission in Amman are experiencing societal pressures </p><p>and some personal doubts about working for the USG as a </p><p>result of the war with Iraq. A recent news article </p><p>implying that some FSNs effectively are spying on </p><p>demonstrators for the Embassy was particularly disturbing </p><p>to them. The Post FSN committee has expressed FSN worries </p><p>about life-insurance restrictions should they be </p><p>killed in a war-related or terrorist incident and has </p><p>asked about establishing a "danger pay" for FSNs working </p><p>at the Embassy.  Meanwhile, rising anti-American </p><p>sentiments have resulted in some vendors and landlords </p><p>refusing to work with the Embassy now. Even some </p><p>professional-level contacts are shying away from </p><p>association with the Embassy. The Regional Medical Officer </p><p>recently was advised by close Jordanian medical colleagues </p><p>to stay away from the hospital principally used by the </p><p>Embassy because they feared for his personal safety. As </p><p>the war in Iraq and the Intifada go on, pressures on our </p><p>FSN employees to disassociate themselves from the Embassy </p><p>are likely to grow. End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  The referenced telegram from Sanaa struck a chord </p><p>with us here in Amman where our FSNs are experiencing </p><p>similar pressures and concerns now that the battle has </p><p>been joined in Iraq.  Many FSNs have expressed the </p><p>increasing discomfort they feel due to their association </p><p>with the Embassy. This includes hearing disparaging remarks </p><p>from friends and family members, some of whom have </p><p>encouraged them to quit working for the Americans.  Some </p><p>have noted that they feel very uncomfortable calling </p><p>Jordanian contacts and requesting meetings or information. </p><p>One pointed to a small news article published in the most </p><p>recent edition of As-Sabeel -- the mouthpiece of the </p><p>Islamic Action Front -- which reported that "some members </p><p>of the American Embassy staff" are gathering information </p><p>on demonstrations, protests, and other political activity </p><p>that is being used by the USG. The unstated but clear </p><p>implication (in the view of some FSNs) is that those FSNs </p><p>are acting as "spies" for the Americans against their </p><p>Arab brethren.  Obviously, the type of information we are </p><p>talking about is the bread and butter of Embassy </p><p>reporting.  However, it is being painted in the most </p><p>negative of terms, terms which make our FSNs feel very </p><p>uncomfortable. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  The degree to which FSNs are feeling societal </p><p>pressures due to their employment with the Embassy varies. </p><p>FSNs working in the Political section -- who are often </p><p>called on to explain U.S. policy and act as </p><p>intermediaries -- are feeling particularly vulnerable and </p><p>have expressed their growing reservations about working </p><p>for the USG at this time. On the other hand, Consular FSNs, </p><p>although upset by U.S. policies and actions in the region, </p><p>are able to focus their energies on processing visas, which </p><p>they see as providing services to Jordanians.  However, </p><p>one Consular FSN told the acting Consul that she is unable </p><p>to sleep because she is constantly watching the news and </p><p>worrying about the war.  FSNs in USAID report similar </p><p>pressures and anxieties.  The pictures of civilian </p><p>casualties of the war on Arab television are particularly </p><p>disturbing to FSN employees. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  During recent bi-weekly meetings with the </p><p>Management Counselor, Post FSN Committee members discussed </p><p>FSN employee concerns about safety and security. Of </p><p>particular concern to them was the fact that the post\'s </p><p>FSN life insurance program would provide no benefits to </p><p>their families in the event that they were killed as a </p><p>result of war or a terrorist attack.  (Post has addressed </p><p>this by purchasing war-risk supplemental insurance for </p><p>FSNs.) They pointed also to the fact that Americans at </p><p>post are receiving danger pay while FSNs are uncompensated </p><p>for the risks they take in working for the Embassy. They </p><p>worry about being watched and possibly targeted as they </p><p>enter and leave the Embassy compound, as well as about </p><p>possible attacks away from the office. Post management </p><p>views these concerns as valid and is exploring the </p><p>possibility of obtaining a "Unique Conditions of Work" </p><p>allowance to provide the FSNs with some financial </p><p>compensation for those risks. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Meanwhile, we are beginning to experience the </p><p>effects of anti-American sentiments on a professional level </p><p>outside of the Embassy. During a recent visit to the Arab </p><p>Medical Center, the principal hospital used by the Embassy, </p><p>the RMO was pulled aside by concerned Jordanian medical </p><p>colleagues and advised that he should stay away from the </p><p>hospital for his own safety. On the other hand, another </p><p>Embassy officer recently went on a condolence call </p><p>with some trepidation, only to find himself received </p><p>with typically warm Jordanian hospitality. </p><p>6.  (C)  Some vendors and landlords are beginning to </p><p>balk at doing business with the Embassy.  We no longer </p><p>tell potential landlords that we are from the US Embassy </p><p>when looking at properties and we are sometimes rejected </p><p>by landlords when they see the lease and realize they are </p><p>dealing with the USG. In one case, an ironwork vendor who </p><p>has done grill work for the Embassy for years is refusing </p><p>to work with us now. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Comment: While the recent political climate change </p><p>for Americans in Jordan is largely due to the war with </p><p>Iraq, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict remains at the fore- </p><p>front of Jordanian concerns. To date we have experienced </p><p>no degradation in either the quality of FSN performance </p><p>or their willingness to continue working for the USG. </p><p>However, the familial and societal pressures on our FSN </p><p>staff to disassociate themselves from the Embassy will </p><p>increase as the conflict in Iraq -- and the Intifada -- </p><p>go on.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
