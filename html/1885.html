<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 002073 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, KTIA, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: PRELIMINARY REACTIONS TO U.S. </p><p>COMMENTS ON DRAFT BILATERAL DEBT RESCHEDULING </p><p>AGREEMENT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF(S): (A) STATE 140051 (B) ABUJA 1914 (C) ABUJA 1374 </p><p>AND PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. On August 15, EconOff met with Debt Management </p><p>Office Director-General, Akin S. Arikawe, to discuss </p><p>USG reactions to Nigeria\'s proposals for the bilateral </p><p>debt rescheduling agreement as described Ref A. </p><p>Arikawe read through the entire document with EconOff </p><p>and provided immediate reactions to almost all </p><p>paragraphs.  The following contains his preliminary </p><p>comments and do not necessarily reflect the formal </p><p>reply that will be forthcoming in the next 2 - 3 </p><p>weeks. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. Arikawe admitted that, although "they were worth a </p><p>try," he had not expected the USG to agree to the </p><p>proposed fixed interest rate of 4 percent, the </p><p>application of payments first to interest and then to </p><p>principal, or to reciprocal language on termination of </p><p>agreement.  However, Arikawe felt other issues </p><p>warranted closer attention by the USG. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. Per Ref A, USG wants to retain Article IV, </p><p>Paragraphs 1 and 2, which discuss comparable </p><p>treatment.  Arikawe said this would be no problem as </p><p>long as the USG understands that Nigeria will likely </p><p>receive more favorable terms from other creditors. </p><p>Arikawe commented, for example, that he expects </p><p>Nigeria to receive a fixed interest rate from an Euro- </p><p>based country (he did not specify which one).  He </p><p>stated that under the comparable treatment clause, the </p><p>USG could be bound to offer a comparable interest </p><p>rate. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. Arikawe did not accept the USG\'s refusal to delete </p><p>Article IV, Paragraph 4 because, he said, the USG </p><p>holds no other claims other than those included by the </p><p>Agreed Minute. EconOff pointed out that, if the U.S. </p><p>holds no other claims, then the paragraph does no </p><p>harm.  However, Arikawe continued to assert that there </p><p>is no need to include this paragraph.  Arikawe </p><p>explained that with some creditors, such as Germany, </p><p>this clause is necessary because they hold debt not </p><p>covered by the Agreed Minute. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. On the accrual of Additional Interest, Arikawe </p><p>exclaimed that the USG was being "very harsh."  He </p><p>named five or six European countries, including Norway </p><p>and Germany, that had already agreed to grace periods </p><p>of between 15 and 45 days.  Arikawe explained that </p><p>grace periods were sometimes necessary for political </p><p>reasons; the National Assembly may delay approval for </p><p>debt payments in order to maintain political leverage. </p><p>He commented that USG refusal to provide any grace </p><p>period also failed to meet the comparable treatment </p><p>terms described in the Agreed Minute. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. Regarding debt swaps, Arikawe was surprised by the </p><p>USG\'s negative response since Embassy officers had </p><p>recently met with him to raise such a possibility </p><p>(reported in Ref C).  Arikawe believed there was </p><p>strong interest on the part of third parties to buy </p><p>Nigerian debt.  He provided an example of a private </p><p>power company that had expressed interest in assisting </p><p>Nigeria in reducing gas flaring through such an </p><p>arrangement.  Arikawe promised to deliver EconOff a </p><p>letter providing more detailed information on these </p><p>third parties. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. The following reactions pertain to Annex G of the </p><p>draft agreement: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Arikawe said the GON could not accept the accrual </p><p>of interest on payments due on a non-business day if </p><p>the payment is made on the following business day.  He </p><p>explained that if a payment is due on a day that </p><p>happens to be a U.S. bank holiday, for example, then </p><p>Nigeria\'s payment could not be transferred into the </p><p>appropriate account until the following day.  Nigeria </p><p>should not be held accountable for determining which </p><p>days in the U.S. are "non-business days," he stated. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Arikawe had no immediate comment regarding Annex G, </p><p>Paragraphs B.4, C, or D. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Regarding sovereign immunity, Arikawe explained </p><p>that the proposed language would be unacceptable if </p><p>the draft terms are more onerous than the original </p><p>contract terms. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Regarding Events of Default, Arikawe said he could </p><p>accept this clause only if it applies to a default on </p><p>Nigeria\'s U.S. debt, not if it applies to a default on </p><p>debt held by any other Paris Club member. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Regarding Disposition of Indebtedness, the GON </p><p>requests that they be notified before the USG takes </p><p>action to dispose of Nigeria\'s debt.  The reason, </p><p>Arikawe said, is that if the USG proposes to sell to a </p><p>hostile third party that would impose more onerous </p><p>repayment terms, then the GON should be informed and </p><p>have the right to refuse. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Regarding Expenses, Arikawe explained, the courts, </p><p>not the agreement, should decide whether Nigeria is to </p><p>be held responsible for any costs associated with a </p><p>judicial claim. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. Before concluding the meeting, EconOff emphasized </p><p>to Arikawe that the process for negotiating bilateral </p><p>debt agreements in the United States is bureaucratic, </p><p>not political; the USG\'s cookie-cutter approach makes </p><p>Nigeria\'s requested changes difficult to obtain. </p><p>Arikawe understood, commenting that this was a problem </p><p>Nigeria was encountering in many countries, </p><p>particularly Germany where the negotiations are done </p><p>completely by a private financial institution on </p><p>commission from the government. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. Post will forward the GON\'s formal reply to Ref A </p><p>as soon as it is made available. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
