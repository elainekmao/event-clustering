<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 005240 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA -- MCDONALD </p><p>CENTCOM FOR POLAD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/12/2007 </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, PREL, ETRD, JO, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDANIAN ASSESSMENT OF ECONOMIC IMPACT OF </p><p>POSSIBLE IRAQ HOSTILITIES </p><p> </p><p>REF: AMMAN 4697 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: CDA GREGORY L. BERRY.  REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (c)  Post has faxed to NEA/ARN a copy of a paper given to </p><p>DAS Satterfield by Prime Minister Abul Ragheb that describes </p><p>a preliminary Jordanian government interagency assessment of </p><p>the economic impact on Jordan of possible military </p><p>hostilities involving Iraq.  The paper assumes and attempts </p><p>to quantify the value of the loss of grant and subsidized oil </p><p>shipments for Iraq, as well as knock-off effects on </p><p>government revenues and the transportation, tourism, and </p><p>export industries.  It estimates the total cost to the </p><p>Jordanian economy at about $1.4 billion.  Copies of the paper </p><p>are available from NEA/ARN. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (c)  Foreign Minister Muasher told the Charge that he </p><p>would like to discuss the paper during meetings he has </p><p>requested in Washington with the Secretary and other senior </p><p>U.S. Government officials.  Central Bank governor Umayya </p><p>Touqan has also raised a related issue related to impact on </p><p>Jordan\'s banking system of an abrupt halt in UN Oil for Food </p><p>Program trade with Iraq (reftel).  We would also appreciate </p><p>Washington guidance on the issue Touqan raised. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (c)  In post\'s view, given an overall absence of detail, </p><p>the numbers provided in the Jordanian paper are hard to </p><p>assess.  Yet, it seems clear that loss of the oil subsidy </p><p>would be a major economic hit to Jordan.  Although the </p><p>adjustment to market-based oil prices is probably a good </p><p>thing in the long-term, the transitional economic costs will </p><p>no doubt be significant and painful, particularly at a time </p><p>when the Jordanians would be facing major social dislocations </p><p>because of a conflict.  On the other hand, Jordan has </p><p>resources of its own to deal, at least in part, with the </p><p>other identified costs, which are mostly temporary. </p><p>Following are some additional points that may prove useful in </p><p>Washington\'s analysis of the paper and the issues it raises. </p><p> </p><p>--  The paper mentions in passing the possible need to </p><p>provide for refugee flows, but does not quantify the </p><p>potential need.  The Jordanian government has been reluctant </p><p>for political reasons to discuss with the embassy or </p><p>humanitarian organizations its planning for this eventuality. </p><p> The Department may want to suggest to FM Muasher that </p><p>low-key contingency planning by the Jordanians with the </p><p>international community wuold be prudent. </p><p> </p><p>--  The calculation of the value of the Iraqi oil grant and </p><p>subsidy is probably actually underestimated to the extent </p><p>that it sets a higher than market value on the low-quality </p><p>consumer goods exported to Iraq under the oil for goods </p><p>protocol.  Viable alternative markets probably do not exist </p><p>for most (60-70%?) of such goods, so the loss of the Iraqi </p><p>market would mean a permanent loss of income and jobs for a </p><p>significant portion of Jordan\'s manufacturing sector. </p><p> </p><p>--  The paper lumps together permanent and temporary shocks. </p><p>Permanent shocks would include the higher national oil bill </p><p>at market prices and the probable loss of Iraq as a captive </p><p>market for low-quality consumer exports.  Temporary shocks </p><p>include the impact on port and land transport, loss of </p><p>tourism and remittance income. </p><p> </p><p>--  Depending on the scenario, the temporary shocks could be </p><p>quickly reversed and even turn into "positive shocks."  (Note </p><p>that real GDP grew by over 20% in 1992.)  Similarly, the </p><p>opportunity for Jordan of the reopening of the Iraqi economy </p><p>to normal business is not addressed. </p><p> </p><p>--  In addition to not addressing offsetting factors, the </p><p>paper does not discuss resources currently available to </p><p>Jordan.  These include $5 billion in official reserves, $1.5 </p><p>billion in claims on Iraq, and substantial foreign assets of </p><p>the banking system and private sector, as well as the </p><p>increased credibility of the central bank and government. </p><p> </p><p>--  Furthermore, it does not seem to consider savings on debt </p><p>payments under the new Paris Club arrangement or the </p><p>substantial increase in non-Iraq exports expected this year. </p><p>Regarding the latter, it will be critical to keep QIZ exports </p><p>flowing, especially via Haifa; otherwise there could be a </p><p>permanent damage to the initiative. </p><p> </p><p>--  Another critical factor will be how the international </p><p>banking community reacts during a crisis.  Banks, especially </p><p>but not only European and Japanese ones, could preemptively </p><p>interrupt relationships with Jordanian banks ("redlining"), </p><p>making it impossible for Jordanian banks to access overseas </p><p>funds or clear international payments.  This could lead to </p><p>trade disruptions and defaults by Jordanian banks with messy </p><p>and potentially long-lasting legal and financial consequences. </p><p> </p><p>--  In addition to directly providing cash to the Jordanian </p><p>government, there could be other ways to address some of the </p><p>needs identified.  For example, to minimize monetary </p><p>instability and reduce the probability of a speculative hard </p><p>currency outflow, the U.S. could announce a commitment to </p><p>make additional temporary reserves available to the Jordanian </p><p>Central Bank.  This would also increase the ability of the </p><p>Jordanian government to guarantee domestic lending or finance </p><p>debt deferrals for hotels or other firms. </p><p> </p><p>--  We could also consider U.S. government guarantees for </p><p>borrowing by the Jordanian government or banks, although the </p><p>U.S. budget cost of this would be equivalent to direct </p><p>lending.  For this reason, it is likely preferable to provide </p><p>guarantees and lending through international institutions. </p><p> </p><p>--  The IMF and World Bank would be probable sources of </p><p>emergency funding and guarantees, as could be the </p><p>international donor community.  The Paris Club could also </p><p>provide additional extraordinary debt relief, but this would </p><p>be unlikely to provide much help in a crisis since the vast </p><p>majority of debt payments due over the next six years were </p><p>already deferred by the July Paris Club agreement. </p><p>BERRY </p><p></p></div>
