<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L VATICAN 001975 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EUR/SCE (MENNUTI) </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/22/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, VE, VT </p><p>SUBJECT: ENGAGING CATHOLIC CHURCH IN VENEZUELA </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE: 73097 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: AMBASSADOR JIM NICHOLSON, REASON E.O. 12958 1.5 (B,D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C)  PER REFTEL, AMBASSADOR MET WITH VATICAN FM EQUIVALENT </p><p>ARCHBISHOP JEAN LOUIS TAURAN EVENING OF APRIL 19 TO URGE THE </p><p>HOLY SEE TO TAKE AN ACTIVE AND APPROPRIATE ROLE IN SUPPORT OF </p><p>VENEZUELAN DEMOCRACY.  TAURAN WAS WELL BRIEFED ON THE </p><p>SITUATION IN VENEZUELA.  AS USUAL, HE REFERRED TO THE POPE\'S </p><p>STATEMENT ON THE SITUATION (PROMOTING RECONCILIATION AND </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  01975  221619Z </p><p>PEACE), GIVEN AT THE WEDNESDAY, APRIL 17 GENERAL AUDIENCE. </p><p>HE WAS GUARDEDLY POSITIVE ON THE CHURCH TALKING A PLACE IN </p><p>PRESIDENT CHAVEZ\' "NATIONAL DIALOGUE," BUT SAID THAT THE </p><p>POSITION OF THE CHURCH VIS A VIS CHAVEZ WAS UNCERTAIN, GIVEN </p><p>THE LATTER\'S HISTORICAL HOSTILITY TO THE CHURCH.  AMBASSADOR </p><p>AGREED, RECALLING THAT CHAVEZ HAD CALLED THE CHURCH "A </p><p>CANCER" ON THE VENEZUELAN BODY POLITIC JUST A COUPLE OF </p><p>MONTHS AGO. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  TAURAN SAID THE CHURCH HAD TO BE CAREFUL, THAT EVEN </p><p>THOUGH TIME WAS SHORT, THEY WOULD TAKE A LOW PROFILE UNTIL </p><p>THE EARLY POST-COUP PERIOD PLAYS OUT.  HE SAID CHAVEZ IS </p><p>TALKING RECONCILIATION NOW BUT, TAURAN AVERRED, CHAVEZ WAS </p><p>NOT AT ALL TRUSTWORTHY.  THE HOLY SEE FEARS A NEGATIVE </p><p>REACTION TO THE FACT THAT THE CARDINAL ARCHBISHOP OF CARACAS, </p><p>VELASCO GARCIA, HAD SIGNED A DOCUMENT AT THE SATURDAY </p><p>INAUGURATION OF PRESIDENTIAL USURPER CARMONA. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  TAURAN COUNSELED THE USG TO "PRESSURE" THE MILITARY </p><p>AND BUSINESS CLASSES IN VENEZUELA TO SUPPORT THE NATIONAL </p><p>RECONCILIATION NOW THAT CHAVEZ WAS BACK IN POWER.  HE </p><p>SPECULATED THAT SOME GENERALS WHO HAD SUPPORTED THE COUP, </p><p>HAVING SEEN THAT A CARMONA PRESIDENCY LOOKED LIKE IT WOULD </p><p>INVESTIGATE CORRUPTION SCANDALS IN VENEZUELA, DECIDED THAT </p><p>PERHAPS CHAVEZ WAS THE LESSER OF TWO EVILS. TAURAN DECRIED </p><p>THE CONTINUING PRESENCE OF "THOSE 15 CUBAN ADVISORS" AND </p><p>RECALLED THAT WHEN THE POPE MET FIDEL CASTRO IN 1998, FIDEL </p><p>HAD SAID THERE WAS A YOUNG NEW LEADER ON THE SCENE, CALLING </p><p>CHAVEZ "SPLENDID."  TAURAN CLOSED BY ASSURING US THAT HE </p><p>WOULD SPEAK TO HIS NUNCIO OVER THE WEEKEND, AND WOULD STAY IN </p><p>CLOSE TOUCH AS WE GO FORWARD. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  01975  221619Z </p><p>NICHOLSON </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p></p></div>
