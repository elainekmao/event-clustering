REASONS: 1.5 </p><p>(B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) AFTER FORCING SUPREME COURT CHIEF JUSTICE ANTHONY </p><p>GUBBAY INTO EARLY RETIREMENT ON FEBRUARY 2 (REFTEL), THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT HAS NOW TURNED ITS ATTENTION TO GUBBAY\'S FOUR </p><p>COLLEAGUES ON ZIMBABWE\'S HIGHEST BENCH.  ON FEBRUARY 9, </p><p>JUSTICE MINISTER PATRICK CHINAMASA ASKED FOR THE </p><p>RESIGNATION OF JUSTICE NICHOLAS MCNALLY AND WAS EXPECTED TO </p><p>MAKE THE SAME DEMAND LATER IN THE DAY OF JUSTICE AHMED </p><p>IBRAHIM.  MCNALLY, WHO REACHES THE MANDATORY RETIREMENT AGE </p><p>OF 70 IN DECEMBER OF THIS YEAR, IS INCLINED TO SUBMIT HIS </p><p>RESIGNATION, CONVINCED THAT THE ONLY ALTERNATIVE IS FURTHER </p><p>INTIMIDATION AND LIKELY PHYSICAL HARM BY THE GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>SO-CALLED WAR VETERANS AND SUSPENSION OF HIS PENSION.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>GO, OR ELSE </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) ZIMBABWEAN SUPREME COURT JUSTICE NICHOLAS MCNALLY </p><p>(PROTECT) TOLD POLITICAL SECTION CHIEF ON FEBRUARY 9 THAT </p><p>JUSTICE MINISTER PATRICK CHINAMASA HAD ASKED HIM EARLIER </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00694  01 OF 02  091143Z </p><p>THAT DAY TO SUBMIT HIS RESIGNATION, EVEN THOUGH HE DOES NOT </p><p>REACH THE MANDATORY RETIREMENT AGE OF 70 UNTIL DECEMBER OF </p><p>THIS YEAR.  ASKED WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF HE REFUSED, </p><p>CHINAMASA SAID THE PRESIDENT DID NOT WANT MCNALLY TO GET </p><p>HURT, BUT, IF HE DECLINED TO COMPLY WITH THE GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>REQUEST, "THERE WILL BE AN UGLY CONFRONTATION." </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) THE JUSTICE TOLD POLCHIEF HE IS INCLINED TO GIVE IN </p><p>TO CHINAMASA\'S ULTIMATUM.  ALTHOUGH MCNALLY WOULD FEEL </p><p>TERRIBLE ABOUT "DESERTING" ZIMBABWEANS WHO RELY ON THE </p><p>JUDICIARY TO BE AN EFFECTIVE CHECK ON THE EXECUTIVE, </p><p>PARTICULARLY DURING THESE DIFFICULT TIMES, HE FELT AS </p><p>THOUGH HE HAS LITTLE CHOICE.  THE JUSTICE IS CONVINCED </p><p>THAT, IF HE WERE TO CHOOSE TO STAY ON, THE SO-CALLED WAR </p><p>VETERANS WOULD BE DIRECTED TO INTENSIFY THEIR INTIMIDATION </p><p>OF HIM AND LIKELY WOULD SEEK TO DO PHYSICAL HARM TO HIM OR </p><p>HIS FAMILY.  IN ADDITION, MCNALLY SAID HE WILL BE DEPENDENT </p><p>UPON HIS PENSION ONCE HE RETIRES, AND FEARS THAT THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT MIGHT SIMPLY SUSPEND PAYMENT OF IT.  BESIDES, </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT HAS MADE CLEAR ITS DETERMINATION TO </p><p>CONTINUE TO IGNORE JUDICIAL RULINGS AND HAS NOW STOPPED </p><p>BOTHERING EVEN TO APPEAR IN COURT TO ANSWER CLAIMS FROM </p><p>FARMERS AND MEMBERS OF THE OPPOSITION.  A FURTHER </p><p>CONSIDERATION IS THAT MCNALLY COULD NOT COUNTENANCE WORKING </p><p>FOR GODFREY CHIDYAUSIKU, THE LIKELY CANDIDATE TO REPLACE </p><p>ANTHONY GUBBAY AS CHIEF JUSTICE.  THE NORMALLY RESERVED </p><p>MCNALLY CALLED THE PRO-ZANU-PF CHIDYAUSIKU A "SLIMY </p><p>BASTARD."  CHINAMASA REPORTEDLY IS EYEING THE CHIEF JUSTICE </p><p>POSITION HIMSELF, BUT MCNALLY THOUGHT CHIDYAUSIKU WAS THE </p><p>ODDS-ON FAVORITE. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00694  01 OF 02  091143Z </p><p>4.  (C) MCNALLY SAID CHINAMASA WOULD BE MEETING LATER IN </p><p>THE DAY WITH HIS COLLEAGUE, JUSTICE AHMED IBRAHIM, AND </p><p>WOULD DEMAND HIS IMMEDIATE RESIGNATION AS WELL.  IBRAHIM IS </p><p>ONLY 63, BUT MCNALLY THOUGHT HE WOULD BE INCLINED TO COMPLY </p><p>WITH CHINAMASA\'S DEMAND.  WHAT REMAINS UNCLEAR, MCNALLY </p><p>OFFERED, IS WHETHER THE GOVERNMENT WOULD DEMAND THE </p><p>DEPARTURE OF THE COURT\'S TWO BLACK JUSTICES, AND WHETHER OR </p><p>NOT THEY WOULD AGREE TO GO IF PRESSED. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) AFTER FORCING CHIEF JUSTICE GUBBAY INTO EARLY </p><p>RETIREMENT ON FEBRUARY 2 (REFTEL), THE GOVERNMENT IS NOW </p><p>INTIMIDATING HIS COLLEAGUES INTO STEPPING DOWN AS WELL. </p><p>THE DEPARTURE OF ALL THREE JUDGES (TWO WHITE AND ONE OF </p><p>ASIAN HERITAGE) WOULD KNOCK OUT 60 PERCENT OF THE SUPREME </p><p>COURT IN A SEVEN-DAY PERIOD.  MCNALLY, WHO OPPOSED THE IAN </p><p>SMITH REGIME AND HAS SERVED ON THE SUPREME COURT SINCE </p><p>1984, CLEARLY RESENTED THE GOVERNMENT\'S PRESSURE, BUT </p><p>ENSURING HIS PERSONAL SAFETY AND THAT OF HIS FAMILY, ALONG </p><p>WITH THE NEED TO PRESERVE HIS FINANCIAL SECURITY IN </p><p>RETIREMENT, PROVIDE COMPELLING REASONS TO GO.  THESE </p><p>DEPARTURES, HOWEVER, DRIVE THE STAKE FURTHER INTO THE HEART </p><p>OF THE RULE OF LAW HERE, AND REMOVES THE ONLY GENUINE CHECK </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ0024 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  00694  02 OF 02  091143Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DINT-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00   FAAE-00 </p><p>      FBIE-00  VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    L-00 </p><p>      VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00 </p><p>      PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    SSO-00   STR-00 </p><p>      TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-01   DRL-02   G-00 </p><p>      NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00    /009W </p><p>                  ------------------C364B2  091143Z /38 </p><p>O 091144Z FEB 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 8201 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 000694 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR WILLIAMS </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>PASS USAID FOR AFR/SA C.
