<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 000279 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CAIRO FOR POL - J. MAXSTADT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/06/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, KDEM, MASS, IV, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: JANUARY 25 MEETING WITH OBASANJO </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter for Reasons 1.5 </p><p>(b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary: During a one-hour January 25 meeting with </p><p>Ambassador Jeter, President Obasanjo spoke optimistically, </p><p>though briefly, about his electoral chances.  In the lead- </p><p>up to the election, the President predicted his opponents </p><p>would try to exploit Iraq and the perception of the USG as </p><p>anti-Moslem to mount protests assailing his Administration </p><p>and its pro-Western leaning. On Cote d\'Ivoire, Obasanjo </p><p>declared Nigeria would not send peacekeeping troops but </p><p>might give logistical support to the ECOFORCE deployment. </p><p>Nigeria would also remain engaged diplomatically.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>THE DIFFICULT PART IS OVER! </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The President described the PDP convention as his </p><p>most troublesome hurdle on the road to reelection.  Having </p><p>cleared that obstacle, he predicted winning approximately </p><p>"60%" of the vote in the April general election.  Obasanjo </p><p>gauged that religion could become a divisive element in the </p><p>campaign, given ANPP\'s flagbearer Muhammadu Buhari\'s </p><p>purported statements on Shari\'a and on the imperative of </p><p>Moslems voting for a co-religionist.  However, the </p><p>confident Obasanjo planned to counter the centrifugal </p><p>tactics of his foes by getting on the campaign trail to </p><p>inform the electorate that, during his term at the helm, he </p><p>had benefited Nigeria\'s Moslem\'s more than Buhari did as </p><p>Head of State. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Regarding electoral violence, Obasanjo felt </p><p>violence would not mar the election although some incidents </p><p>would be inevitable.  However, he warned that the emotive </p><p>confluence of electoral politics, religion, Iraq and the </p><p>Middle East made for a potentially combustible mixture in </p><p>Nigeria. Electoral foes would try to stoke religious </p><p>sentiment and indirectly generate opposition to him by </p><p>protesting against USG policy on Iraq and the Middle East. </p><p>(Note: The previous day, President Obasanjo telephoned the </p><p>Ambassador that Nigerian security forces had blocked </p><p>numerous "rascally boys" from entering Abuja for the </p><p>purpose of protesting USG policy on Iraq. Although the </p><p>alleged hirelings had been turned back (Obasanjo would not </p><p>reveal where they were coming from), Obasanjo remained </p><p>concerned that trouble was still afoot. At the President\'s </p><p>express insistence, we cancelled State Department Public </p><p>Affairs Officer Nabeel Khoury\'s speaking engagement on </p><p>USG\'s Middle East policy scheduled that day in nearby </p><p>Kaduna. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Comment: We are unable to verify the presence of </p><p>the alleged protesters but the account is plausible. Some </p><p>Embassy Officers had heard rumors of a protest scheduled </p><p>for either Abuja or Kaduna.  Obasanjo certainly does not </p><p>want the security headache that goes along with such </p><p>protests.  Demonstrations in Abuja can be like wildfire -- </p><p>once started, they can get out of hand quickly.  Given </p><p>Obasanjo\'s strong identification with America in the </p><p>Nigerian mind, the President recognizes that an anti- </p><p>American protest is tantamount to an anti-Obasanjo outing; </p><p>in any event, it could quickly take that turn.  While </p><p>confident in winning the election, protests in the capital </p><p>would not present an attractive visual and would dampen </p><p>Obasanjo\'s campaign.  End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>HOW IRAQ IS PLAYING IN NIGERIA </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Because of this volatility, Obasanjo cautioned that </p><p>we tread lightly in using public fora to explain our Middle </p><p>East and Iraq policies. He also thought that any overt </p><p>attempts by Nigeria\'s friends in the West to defuse </p><p>religion as a potential campaign issue would be counter- </p><p>productive.  If we decided, nevertheless, to go forward </p><p>with such programs, Obasanjo asked that our plans be vetted </p><p>with him. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Ambassador Jeter informed the President about the </p><p>January 25-27, private conference on USG engagement with </p><p>Islam that we were co-sponsoring with the Emir of Kano and </p><p>that was closed to the public and press. Obasanjo responded </p><p>positively to the idea but asked that we inform him of any </p><p>similar future events.  When Ambassador Jeter mentioned the </p><p>receipt of a letter from Zamfara State Governor Ahmed Sani </p><p>requesting the Embassy to co-sponsor a conference on </p><p>Shari\'a, Obasanjo shook his head negatively. He asserted </p><p>that Sani was not a suitable co-sponsor.  (Note: Although </p><p>in different political parties, Obasanjo has a congenial </p><p>personal relationship with Sani, referring to the firebrand </p><p>as his "campaign manager" in Zamfara.  The President </p><p>probably believes Sani, known as the champion of Shari\'a in </p><p>the North, would not be able to resist inflammatory </p><p>statements in an attempt to milk all the political capital </p><p>that he could from such a conference. End note.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Before accepting proposals for public conferences </p><p>on religion or Shari\'a, the Embassy should first seek the </p><p>advice of the Sultan of Sokoto, the spiritual leader of </p><p>Nigeria\'s Muslims.  Obasanjo said he sought out the Sultan </p><p>when Zamfara\'s Deputy Governor issued his infamous Fatwa </p><p>against Isioma Daniels, the journalist who wrote the </p><p>controversial Miss World editorial that sparked rioting in </p><p>Kaduna last year.  "I asked the Sultan was this the proper </p><p>way to issue a Fatwa?" Obasanjo recalled.  The Sultan\'s </p><p>response was negative.  As a result of their conversation, </p><p>the Sultan rescinded the improper Fatwa and the controversy </p><p>began to die, Obasanjo remarked.  If we decided to go </p><p>forward on a conference on Shari\'a, Obasanjo said that we </p><p>too should seek the Sultan\'s advice. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>Cote d\'Ivoire and Regional Peacekeeping </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Obasanjo\'s comments indicated his endorsement of </p><p>the Ivorien peace plan was not whole-hearted.  He described </p><p>the plan as effectively "disrobing" President Gbagbo. </p><p>However, in the final analysis, Nigeria "could not be </p><p>holier than the Pope."  If this is what the Ivoriens </p><p>agreed, Nigeria will support it, he declared. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) However, deployment of Nigerian peacekeepers would </p><p>not be part of that support, the President said. Nigeria </p><p>might send engineers, medical units, signal corps or other </p><p>logistical help, however, front-line troops, not even after </p><p>the elections, would not be included.  Prior to embarking </p><p>on another expensive peacekeeping deployment, Nigeria </p><p>needed to put "some things in order" regarding its ECOMOG </p><p>deployments in Sierra Leon and Liberia, he opined. </p><p>Foremost, Nigeria had not rendered an accurate public </p><p>accounting of the losses it suffered in those missions. </p><p>"No one knows how many died in Sierra Leone and Liberia" he </p><p>lamented. The closest approximation to an accounting is </p><p>former ECOMOG Force Commander S.V. Malu\'s estimate of 800 </p><p>Nigerian soldiers dead. Ambassador noted that several years </p><p>ago, he had heard very confidentially from Malu\'s ECOMOG </p><p>Chief of Staff that Nigeria had lost more than 1,000 troops </p><p>in Liberia.  Obasanjo noted that that figure also matched </p><p>his conclusions.  Obasanjo went on to clarify that Nigeria </p><p>was not turning its back on peacekeeping, but that it must </p><p>"come to closure" on these two missions prior to joining </p><p>any future PKO\'s in the region. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) If Nigeria could not participate in the Ivorien </p><p>peacekeeping mission, Ambassador Jeter urged Obasanjo to </p><p>become more engaged diplomatically in the Ivorien peace </p><p>process. Nigeria has been "missing in action" on the </p><p>diplomatic front, he stressed. Obasanjo pledged Nigeria </p><p>would become more engaged politically, making clear that </p><p>Nigeria had not repudiated its heretofore active </p><p>involvement in sub-regional peacekeeping.  Moreover, he </p><p>said that Nigeria would engage again in peacekeeping but </p><p>must do so in a way that is more transparent to the average </p><p>Nigerian. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) Obasanjo discounted reports of official Liberian </p><p>involvement in the Ivorien morass. He believed ex-factional </p><p>fighters from Liberia were gravitating to Cote d\'Ivoire </p><p>because it represented what they knew, a way to make money </p><p>by the use of a gun. Poverty was the ultimate culprit, he </p><p>argued. Poor men with guns were like locusts swarming to </p><p>the latest harvest. No country was immune to this somber </p><p>reality; any country in West Africa could be destabilized </p><p>for USD 100,000. Obasanjo hoped to address this issue </p><p>within the larger context of regional development during </p><p>the July Sullivan Summit in Abuja. Already, six Heads of </p><p>State had accepted his invitation. He hoped POTUS would </p><p>also accept. (Note: A copy of the invitation to POTUS has </p><p>been forwarded Septel. End Note.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) While very confident about his reelection </p><p>prospects, President Obasanjo was very concerned about the </p><p>possible protests regarding Iraq and the Middle East. He </p><p>also has become more reticent about Cote d\'Ivoire. Before, </p><p>the Nigerians were giving some indications that they would </p><p>consider an active peacekeeping role after the April </p><p>elections. Obasanjo seemed to nix that idea. His rationale </p><p>that Nigeria must publicly account for its Liberian and </p><p>Sierra Leonean deployments is valid and essential for a </p><p>democracy. However, the timing is a bit odd. Perhaps it is </p><p>an indirection to let us know that stiff opposition would </p><p>mount should he propose a major Nigerian peacekeeping </p><p>operation right after the election. Additionally, his </p><p>reluctance may be due to France\'s role in forging a </p><p>controversial peace agreement that Obasanjo personally </p><p>probably does not like. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
