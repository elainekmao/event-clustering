HARARE 1101 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Officer Audu Besmer for reasons 1.5 b/d </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) MDC Presidential Advisor Gandi Mudzingwa and MDC MP </p><p>Roy Bennett both said recently that the June mass action was </p><p>a success overall, but suffered from organizational problems </p><p>that the party is resolving.  Mudzingwa thought the problems </p><p>were due to too many MPs becoming involved in key </p><p>decision-making, but Bennett said parallel local MDC </p><p>structures competed for resources, preventing adequate </p><p>organizing for the mass action.  It would appear that </p><p>although the MDC would like to send the outward message that </p><p>the June mass action was a resounding success, they </p><p>acknowledge organizational and command and control problems </p><p>that detracted from its overall impact.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Too Many Cooks </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Mudzingwa said the MDC viewed the June mass action as </p><p>a success primarily because it forced Mugabe to use security </p><p>forces against the populace.  This was a sign that Mugabe </p><p>acknowledges that the populace in sufficient numbers is </p><p>sufficiently willing to protest so as to require a show of </p><p>military force to prevent public protest.  Gandi said that in </p><p>contrast to the previous mass action, over which he had </p><p>primary command and control, this most recent mass action </p><p>suffered from too many others becoming involved in key </p><p>decision-making.  As a result of the success of the March </p><p>2003 stayaway, many MDC MPs wanted to get into the limelight, </p><p>and in on decision-making, for the June mass action.  Hence </p><p>some bad decisions were made; in particular, public comments </p><p>(like Tsvangirai\'s "Final Push" speech) were not cleared </p><p>properly.  Though scolding those responsible would be </p><p>destructive at this point, Gandi said the party did have a </p><p>plan to sort out decision-making and planning was already </p><p>underway for future mass action. </p><p> </p><p>Parallel Local Structures Counterproductive </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) On July 2 MDC MP Roy Bennett told Poloff the June mass </p><p>action was a success, but suffered from organizational </p><p>problems.  MDC Action Committees received funding from party </p><p>headquarters to plan for the mass action and organize at the </p><p>local level.  Bennett said that Mudzingwa spearheaded the </p><p>creation of these committees in February 2002 to organize for </p><p>the March 2003 mass action.  Bennett said these committees </p><p>were set up alongside existing party structures.  The two </p><p>groups apparently competed against one another for funding </p><p>and control, and significant resentment arose.  In some </p><p>cases, each group informed police of the other\'s activities </p><p>and police subsequently cracked down on one or the other, </p><p>negating both groups\' efforts to organize the people for mass </p><p>action.  According to Bennett, the Zimbabwean people heeded </p><p>the call to protest, but the party leaders and organizers did </p><p>not show up in significant numbers to galvanize people who </p><p>had gathered into marches.  Bennett said this problem has led </p><p>to resentment between some elected MPs and Mudzingwa and </p><p>technocrats under his leadership.  The issue was hotly </p><p>debated at the recent MDC executive meeting, and the two </p><p>local structures are subsequently being incorporated and the </p><p>MDC\'s reach hopefully deepened in the process.  Bennett also </p><p>confirmed that future mass actions were being planned. </p><p> </p><p>Comment: </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) It appears that although the MDC would like to send </p><p>the outward message that the June mass action was a </p><p>resounding success, they acknowledge internally that there </p><p>were shortcomings in its organization that detracted from its </p><p>overall impact.  The Party\'s message leading up to the mass </p><p>action was ambiguous and led to exaggerated expectations of </p><p>what could be achieved and consequent disappointment that no </p><p>breakthrough in Zimbabwe\'s crisis was achieved.  It would </p><p>also appear there are internal power struggles and </p><p>differences of opinion which need to be resolved before the </p><p>party undertakes further mass action.  End Comment. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
