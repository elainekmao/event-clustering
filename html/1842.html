THE SOUTHERN AFRICA CORRESPONDENTS FOR THE NEW YORK </p><p>TIMES AND THE WASHINGTON POST SUCCESSFULLY USED THE NEW </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  02327  031030Z </p><p>MEDIA ACCREDITATION PROCEDURES PUT INTO PLACE BY </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN INFORMATION MINISTER JONATHAN MOYO IN JUNE </p><p>2001.  THE JOHANNESBURG-BASED JOURNALISTS ARRIVED IN </p><p>ZIMBABWE AUGUST 1 AND 3 AND INTEND TO SPEND ABOUT A WEEK </p><p>IN THE COUNTRY COVERING POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC ISSUES. </p><p> </p><p>2. THE JOURNALISTS FOLLOWED THE NEWLY ESTABLISHED </p><p>PROCEDURE OF APPLYING FOR PERMISSION, ON COMPANY </p><p>LETTERHEAD, TO ENTER ZIMBABWE ONE MONTH IN ADVANCE OF </p><p>ARRIVAL.  THEY DEALT DIRECTLY WITH THE MINISTRY OF </p><p>INFORMATION IN HARARE RATHER THAN THROUGH THE ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>HIGH COMMISSION IN SOUTH AFRICA.  IN RESPONSE TO THE </p><p>APPLICATIONS, THE MINISTRY OF INFORMATION SENT </p><p>"INVITATION" LETTERS TO THE CORRESPONDENTS IN </p><p>JOHANNESBURG.  UPON ARRIVAL AT THE AIRPORT IN HARARE, </p><p>THE JOURNALISTS PRESENTED THESE LETTERS TO IMMIGRATION </p><p>OFFICIALS AND WERE ALLOWED TO ENTER WITH THE INSTRUCTION </p><p>TO REPORT THE NEXT DAY TO THE MINISTRY OF INFORMATION TO </p><p>GET THEIR VISA/ACCREDITATION.  UPON PAYMENT OF THE USD </p><p>100 FEE, THE WASHINGTON POST CORRESPONDENT WAS GIVEN A </p><p>VISA/CREDENTIAL VALID FOR 9 DAYS, THE AMOUNT OF TIME HE </p><p>REQUESTED.  THIS FEE MUST BE PAID EACH TIME THE </p><p>JOURNALIST ENTERS ZIMBABWE.  THE NEW YORK TIMES </p><p>REPORTERS ARE TO REPORT TO THE MINISTRY LATER TODAY. </p><p> </p><p>3. IN THIS CASE THE NEW ACCREDITATION PROCEDURE FOR </p><p>FOREIGN JOURNALISTS WORKED EXACTLY AS ADVERTISED BY </p><p>MINISTER MOYO.  THE JOURNALISTS TELL US THAT MINISTRY </p><p>OFFICIALS SAY THEY "WILL BE FLEXIBLE" IF A BREAKING </p><p>STORY IN ZIMBABWE MAKES ADVANCE APPLICATION FOR A VISA </p><p>IMPRACTICAL.  WE EXPECT THERE WILL BE OPPORTUNITIES TO </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02327  031030Z </p><p>TEST THE MINISTRY\'S FLEXIBILITY IN THE MONTHS TO COME. </p><p>WE WILL ALSO WATCH WITH INTEREST TO SEE IF UNFLATTERING </p><p>REPORTING ON ZIMBABWE MAKE THE VISA/ACCREDITATION </p><p>PROCESS MORE DIFFICULT. </p><p> </p><p>HOOKS </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
