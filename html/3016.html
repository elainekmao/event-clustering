<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 001594 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>KAMPALA FOR AID - DAWN LIBERI; RIYADH FOR POL - R. HANKS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O.12958: DECL: 5/23/12 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, EFIN, EAID, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: OBASANJO SAYS BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP </p><p>IS A ONE-WAY STREET </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA 1091 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER. REASON 1.5 </p><p>(B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: During a late evening May 18 </p><p>conversation with Ambassador Jeter, an animated </p><p>President Obasanjo claimed the bilateral relationship </p><p>was too one-sided. While we dun him with multiple </p><p>demands to reform at home and hew our line on foreign </p><p>policy issues abroad (Zimbabwe and Cuba), we were deaf </p><p>to his pleas for debt relief. The bilateral </p><p>relationship would suffer unless we were more </p><p>forthcoming on the debt issue, he asserted. Recently </p><p>returned from the ECOWAS meeting in Yamoussoukro, </p><p>Obasanjo stated that he and President Wade were </p><p>selected to mediate a Liberian cease-fire. However, </p><p>Obasanjo was not very sanguine about the assignment, </p><p>stating President Taylor had previously rebuffed his </p><p>attempted brokerage between the GOL and its political </p><p>opposition. Although not wanting to speak in great </p><p>detail about domestic politics, Obasanjo expressed </p><p>confidence that elections would be nonviolent and that </p><p>he would emerge on top. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>YOU ARE INDEBTED TO RELIEVE MY DEBT </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) A few minutes into a brief discussion with </p><p>Ambassador Jeter about difficulties the Embassy was </p><p>having with the Ministry of Women\'s Affairs regarding </p><p>operation of the EDDI-funded Community Resource Center </p><p>in Abuja, Obasanjo quickly picked up the telephone. </p><p>Calling the Women\'s Affairs Minister, he ordered her </p><p>to resolve the problem quickly. Purposefully within </p><p>earshot of the Ambassador, Obasanjo stressed he had </p><p>much bigger fish to fry with the USG and wanted this </p><p>relatively minor irritant off the bilateral docket so </p><p>that he could focus on the issue that interested him </p><p>the most -- debt relief. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Putting down the telephone receiver and angling </p><p>his body toward the Ambassador, Obasanjo plaintively </p><p>remarked the USG "would not be his friend for long" </p><p>unless he saw progress on debt relief. Becoming more </p><p>agitated as he spoke, Obasanjo grumbled that he </p><p>traveled the world for three years championing debt </p><p>relief but had returned home empty-handed. Stopping </p><p>himself mid-sentence from using a strong expletive, he </p><p>lamented, "I have not received one f. penny, not one!" </p><p>He stated that he had talked to President Bush and </p><p>Prime Minister Blair but to no avail. "I don\'t </p><p>understand it," he decried. Obasanjo then raised the </p><p>failed debt/environment swap, claiming the USG did not </p><p>even have the courtesy to formally notify him the </p><p>proposal was aborted by the oil companies. He learned </p><p>of the failure through the media but only after he had </p><p>publicized the deal in Nigeria.  By skimming 10 </p><p>percent of the bilateral debt, he had viewed the swap </p><p>as a good first step and a political victory. Instead, </p><p>the episode became a significant embarrassment, he </p><p>maintained. When Ambassador Jeter tried to make the </p><p>linkage between reform and relief, Obasanjo flung </p><p>himself back in his chair for effect and bellowed, </p><p>"Come on, Ambassador!" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) While we act cavalierly on issues of grave </p><p>concern to him, we had the temerity to demand he </p><p>follow our lead on issues important to us, Obasanjo </p><p>asserted. Citing the recent Cuba resolution before the </p><p>UN Human Rights Commission, Obasanjo railed that the </p><p>USG expected him to change long-standing GON policy on </p><p>Cuba, a traditional friend, because the issue was </p><p>important to the White House. Yet when he asked the </p><p>USG to change its established policy on debt, he </p><p>received a cold shoulder. Obasanjo emphasized he was </p><p>as much a leader of a nation as President Bush. If we </p><p>wanted him to continue carrying our water in </p><p>international fora, we should reciprocate on issues of </p><p>importance to Nigeria. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>LET\'S TALK </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) When the Ambassador stated the need for </p><p>frequent dialogue to more clearly define areas of </p><p>convergent and divergent views, Obasanjo agreed but </p><p>stressed that Zimbabwe was off-limits. Iterating a </p><p>theme of their April meeting (reftel), Obasanjo told </p><p>Ambassador Jeter that all of Africa was looking to </p><p>Nigeria on Zimbabwe. He had to ensure that whatever </p><p>decision he took would be seen as truly Nigeria\'s and </p><p>not an imposition from the West. "So if you try to </p><p>talk to me about Zimbabwe, I will cut you off," he </p><p>pledged. Obasanjo added that the USG linkage of NEPAD </p><p>and Zimbabwe was wrong-minded. He also blanched the </p><p>USG would attempt to tell him what NEPAD\'s mandate </p><p>should be when he was one of NEPAD\'s architects. </p><p>(Comment: Obasanjo\'s statements imply a significant </p><p>difference between his vision of the peer review </p><p>mechanism and what we assume it will be.  End </p><p>comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>LIBERIA, AGAIN! </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Obasanjo related that a significant portion of </p><p>the Yamoussoukro NEPAD conference was devoted to </p><p>Liberia. He stated that President Taylor was in </p><p>serious trouble but had himself to blame; there was </p><p>little sympathy among ECOWAS Heads of State for their </p><p>colleague in Monrovia. Obasanjo did not relish being </p><p>named, along with ECOWAS Chairman Wade, to mediate a </p><p>cease-fire in Liberia. Obasanjo also claimed that Wade </p><p>was piqued after Taylor had spat in his soup by </p><p>insisting on continuation of the "Rabat Process" </p><p>instead of the proposed intra-ECOWAS diplomacy under </p><p>Wade\'s leadership. Giving the impression he did not </p><p>intend to invest significant energy in this endeavor, </p><p>Obasanjo remarked that Taylor had rejected his attempt </p><p>to reconcile the GOL with its political opposition </p><p>when such a process might have forestalled the LURD </p><p>emergence. I did my best to bring Taylor to Abuja for </p><p>talks, but he would not come."  Now Taylor\'s hubris </p><p>had led to a much stronger challenge to his </p><p>government\'s survival. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Obasanjo also denied rumors Nigeria had </p><p>furnished weapons to Taylor. He pointed north to </p><p>Tripoli as a possible source and said he would ask </p><p>Quaddafi who has been surprisingly forthright when </p><p>questioned about Liberia in the past. (Comment: </p><p>Obasanjo seems to have warmed to the task since the </p><p>meeting. On May 22, ECOWAS ExSec Chambas informed </p><p>Ambassador that he had a two-hour meeting with </p><p>Obasanjo to discuss an ECOWAS team of military </p><p>advisors visit to Liberia to assess and investigate </p><p>the deteriorating security situation there. In a May </p><p>23 aside, NSA Aliyu Mohammed told the Ambassador the </p><p>GON had convinced Taylor to come to Abuja for talks </p><p>about his situation at home. End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>ELECTIONS AT HOME -- A PIECE OF CAKE/ A SLICE OF GOD </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Clearly not wanting to engage in a detailed </p><p>discussion about internal politics, Obasanjo </p><p>nonetheless became more relaxed when Ambassador Jeter </p><p>asked about security preparations for the upcoming </p><p>elections, particularly local government contests in </p><p>August. Downplaying recent incidents of localized </p><p>electoral violence, Obasanjo said security </p><p>preparations were in train. Predicting no major </p><p>trouble, he averred, "God and we" would make sure that </p><p>electioneering did not run amok. Obasanjo expressed </p><p>confidence that he would be reelected. On his vision </p><p>for a second term, he stated that his first term was </p><p>devoted to excising the "debris" clogging the system </p><p>due to years of misrule. In the next term, he would </p><p>stick to the same programs and policies but would be </p><p>able to move faster because of the ground clearing </p><p>done this term. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) In many respects a continuation of the meeting </p><p>reported reftel, this session did not break new </p><p>ground. However, it brought into sharper focus </p><p>Obasanjo\'s edginess regarding lack of progress on debt </p><p>relief. There is no reason not to take him at his </p><p>word.  Unless there is a better meeting of the minds </p><p>on the debt question, Obasanjo and the GON will </p><p>increasingly become more difficult partners. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
