<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 001029 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 3/26/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: SUPREME COURT OVERTURNS LOCAL </p><p>GOVERNMENT EXTENSIONS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER; REASON 1.5 (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) On March 28, the Nigerian Supreme Court ruled </p><p>that the National Assembly had overstepped its </p><p>constitutional authority in enacting the electoral law </p><p>that, in effect, extended the tenure of local </p><p>government officials by rescheduling local government </p><p>elections from April 2002 to 2003. In a lengthy </p><p>twenty-eight page decision, the court concluded the </p><p>National Assembly was not entitled to amend the tenure </p><p>of the local government officials or change the date </p><p>for local government elections. The authority to amend </p><p>local government tenures resides in State Assemblies, </p><p>according to the Court. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Pursuant to the judgment, local government </p><p>terms remain at three years as mandated by the </p><p>constitution instead of the four years contemplated by </p><p>the electoral law.  This means that incumbents must </p><p>vacate their offices by May 29, 2002. However, the </p><p>ruling did not address what happens after May 29.  To </p><p>prevent a nationwide vacancy at the local government </p><p>level, either elections have to take place in the next </p><p>few weeks or the governors will exercise their </p><p>executive authority to appoint interim officials until </p><p>electoral preparations can been finalized.  The latter </p><p>prospect pleases many state Chief Executives who would </p><p>like nothing better than to place cronies in the local </p><p>government positions in order to make the path </p><p>smoother for their own reelection bids in 2003. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Due to a variety of legal requirements and </p><p>logistical constraints, it is highly unlikely that </p><p>elections can be held before May 29.  It is more </p><p>likely that the Governors will appoint interim local </p><p>officials until these legal and logistical </p><p>requirements can be met. (A more complete analysis of </p><p>these hurdles will follow Septel.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) COMMENT: Today was a good day for Nigerian </p><p>constitutional jurisprudence. For many reasons, it </p><p>would have been more expedient for the Court to affirm </p><p>the electoral law. However, the Justices appeared to </p><p>be guided more by legal reasoning than extraneous, </p><p>albeit pragmatic, political and logistical concerns. </p><p>The decision was legally sound and one we had forecast </p><p>in previous reporting. However, the judgment raises </p><p>new concerns -- particularly regarding voter and party </p><p>registration for the local elections -- to replace the </p><p>concerns it resolved.  How INEC and the GON handle </p><p>these issues will determine whether today\'s ruling not </p><p>only helped clarify the separation of state and </p><p>federal legislative powers but also whether it helped </p><p>to lend some needed credibility to the electoral </p><p>process. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
