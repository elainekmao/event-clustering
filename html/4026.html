(U) SUMMARY. The seizure on Thursday, October 17 of 3 </p><p>metric tons of food by ZANU-PF activists in Insiza was the </p><p>first documented incident of international food aid theft and </p><p>partisan redistribution.  The Government has denied the </p><p>allegations and tried to divert attention from ZANU-PF food </p><p>aid theft to British involvement in food distribution. END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) On Friday, October 18, the World Food Program </p><p>indefinitely suspended food distributions in Insiza district, </p><p>Matebeleland South, where a parliamentary by-election is </p><p>scheduled to take place October 26-67.  ZANU-PF activists </p><p>seized 3 metric tons of food from WFP,s implementing </p><p>partner, Organization of Rural Associations for Progress </p><p>(ORAP), on Thursday October 17 and began distributing it in </p><p>an unauthorized manner.  A relatively small portion of the </p><p>food seized was U.S.-donated cooking oil.  (NOTE: Mrs. </p><p>Sithembiso Nyoni, who is now Minister of Small and Medium </p><p>Enterprise Development, founded ORAP in 1981.  Both political </p><p>parties have accused ORAP of being partisan in its relief </p><p>activities but checks by us and WFP have shown ORAP to be </p><p>diligently implementing WFP distribution guidelines. END </p><p>NOTE)  Explaining WFP\'s decision to suspend operations in </p><p>Insiza, WFP country director Kevin Farrell told journalists </p><p>that WFP will only distribute its food on the basis of need </p><p>without regard to political affiliation.  He said WFP is </p><p>seeking assurances from the Government of Zimbabwe (GOZ) that </p><p>such incidents will not take place again. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) ZANU-PF dismissed the report as false and tried to </p><p>paint WFP as not being nonpartisan.  In the government </p><p>controlled newspaper, The Herald, Jonathan Moyo, Minister of </p><p>State for Information and Publicity insisted that the WFP was </p><p>being used t further British political interests in Insiza </p><p>and challenged the WFP to assure the country that the British </p><p>are not directing it.  "While we appreciate assistance from </p><p>well-meaning quarters, whether from WFP or anyone else," Moyo </p><p>said, "we are not going to allow it to compromise our </p><p>sovereignty."  The state media, controlled by Moyo, also </p><p>claimed implausibly that ORAP was controlled by MDC activists </p><p>bent on distributing food in a partisan manner. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) The raid on the food distribution depot occurred the </p><p>day after Jonathan Moyo told journalists that the British </p><p>High Commissioner was ordering all NGOs to distribute food to </p><p>MDC supporters ahead of the Insiza by-election but the same </p><p>day the story appeared in the state-run newspaper.  Moyo </p><p>reiterated that the British High Commissioner should desist </p><p>from meddling in Zimbabwe internal affairs.  The British High </p><p>Commission issued a statement on October 17 denying these </p><p>allegations. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) The GOZ is appropriately concerned about the WFP </p><p>food suspension and public statements.  WFP Director Kevin </p><p>Farrell and Minister of Social Welfare July Moyo will travel </p><p>to Insiza October 21 to address the issues. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) ACTION: Post recommends State issue a statement </p><p>expressing outrage and concern about the seizure and partisan </p><p>use of international food aid and we plan to issue a </p><p>statement in Harare as well.  We are sending proposed </p><p>language to the Department separately.  We are also urging </p><p>WFP to insist on return of the food, although we do not </p><p>recommend making this point public as yet. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
