DANFORTH, ITALIAN MFA AGREE ON SUDAN APPROACH </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: POLMINCOUNS T. COUNTRYMAN FOR REASON 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.    (C) SUMMARY:  IN A JANUARY 11 MEETING AT THE MFA, </p><p>SENATOR DANFORTH AND THE MFA DIRECTOR GENERAL FOR AFRICA, </p><p>BRUNO CABRAS, SPOKE OF THE HISTORIC OPPORTUNITY THE SUDANESE </p><p>NOW HAVE TO MAKE PEACE WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>COMMUNITY.  CABRAS REVEALED THAT THE GOI WOULD PROVIDE AN </p><p>ADDITIONAL THREE SPECIALISTS TO HELP IN THE NEGOTIATIONS AND </p><p>MONITORING PROCESSES.  THE TWO MEN TOUCHED ON ASSUAGING </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  00163  01 OF 02  160239Z </p><p>EGYPTIAN FEARS, MAINTAINING INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE THROUGH </p><p>THE IMPLEMENTATION PHASE, AND SUPPORTING THE GOOD EFFORTS OF </p><p>KENYA AND IGAD.  THE MEETING CONFIRMED THAT USG AND GOI </p><p>THINKING ON SUDAN ARE COMPATIBLE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>MFA:  GOI KEENLY INTERESTED IN SUDANESE PEACE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.    (U) AT THE REQUEST OF SPECIAL ENVOY FOR PEACE IN SUDAN </p><p>JOHN DANFORTH, CABRAS AND HE MET AT THE MFA FOR A SATURDAY </p><p>EXCHANGE OF VIEWS.  ALSO PRESENT AT THE MEETING WERE NSC </p><p>AFRICA DIRECTOR MATT MCLEAN, POLMC, POLOFF (NOTETAKER), AND </p><p>MFA EAST AFRICA OFFICE DIRECTOR PAOLA IMPERIALE. </p><p> </p><p>3.    (C) CABRAS UNDERLINED THE GOI\'S INTEREST IN THE PEACE </p><p>PROCESS AND REVEALED THAT NEW GOI PERSONNEL WOULD BE SENT TO </p><p>ASSIST.  THERE WAS "KEEN INTEREST IN THE VATICAN, PRESIDENCY, </p><p>AND MFA" IN SUDAN, BOTH FOR HISTORICAL AND MORAL REASONS AND </p><p>BECAUSE THERE WERE A LOT OF ITALIAN RELIGIOUS WORKERS IN THE </p><p>SOUTH OF SUDAN.  "WE KNOW WE HAVE TO DO MORE," CABRAS SAID, </p><p>PERHAPS REFLECTING MULTIPLE DEMARCHES POST DELIVERED LAST </p><p>YEAR REQUESTING FUNDING AND PERSONNEL FOR THE NUBA MOUNTAINS </p><p>CEASE-FIRE MONITORING UNIT.  HE PROVIDED A DOCUMENT </p><p>COMMITTING A BRIGADIER GENERAL TO MACHAKOS FOR PEACE </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS AND A COLONEL AND MAJOR FOR THE NUBA MOUNTAINS </p><p>TO SERVE, RESPECTIVELY, AS FIELD COMMANDER AND </p><p>LIAISON/OBSERVER.  THIS WAS IN ADDITION TO THE GOI DIPLOMATIC </p><p>LIAISON OFFICER ALREADY IN PLACE.  ASKED WHETHER REPORTS OF </p><p>MILITARY ENGAGEMENT ARE INVESTIGATED BY MONITORS, CABRAS SAID </p><p>THAT ALL REPORTS OF CEASE-FIRE VIOLATIONS ARE INVESTIGATED, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  00163  01 OF 02  160239Z </p><p>BUT THERE HAVE BEEN NO MAJOR VIOLATIONS.  ON THE WHOLE, THE </p><p>AGREEMENT IS HOLDING. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>KEEPING CAIRO ENGAGED AND THE PROCESS ADVANCING </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>4.    (C) CABRAS SAID THAT EGYPT WAS "ALMOST TERRORIZED BY </p><p>THE PEACE PROCESS, WITH ITS POSSIBILITY OF AN INDEPENDENT </p><p>SOUTHERN SUDAN."  IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO ENSURE THAT EGYPT </p><p>DID NOT OPPOSE THE PROCESS.  IN RESPONSE TO DANFORTH\'S </p><p>REQUEST FOR ADVICE FOR HIS MEETINGS IN EGYPT, CABRAS </p><p>SUGGESTED HE REITERATE THAT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY DOES </p><p>NOT WANT SOUTHERN SECESSION BUT AT THIS POINT THE SPLM NEEDS </p><p>A BACKUP PLAN IN CASE THE AGREEMENT IS NOT IMPLEMENTED.  HE </p><p>ALSO ADVISED THAT WE KEEP THE NEW ARAB LEAGUE SPECIAL ENVOY </p><p>IN THE LOOP TO ASSUAGE EGYPTIAN CONCERNS. </p><p> </p><p>5.   (C) IN RESPONSE TO DANFORTH\'S STATEMENT THAT HE HAS </p><p>TRIED TO BE AS EVEN-HANDED AS POSSIBLE, EVEN THOUGH THE U.S. </p><p>VIEW IS THAT THE SOUTH IS THE VICTIM, CABRAS SAID IT WAS </p><p>IMPORTANT TO CONVEY PRESIDENT BUSH\'S CLEAR MESSAGE THAT THE </p><p>SPLM WILL NOT BENEFIT BY GOING SLOWLY.  FOR THE TIME BEING, </p><p>THE GOI DID NOT VIEW THE CURRENT DELAY IN NEGOTIATIONS AS A </p><p>BAD SIGN.  HOWEVER, THE GOS WAS "VERY NERVOUS" ABOUT THE </p><p>SUDAN PEACE ACT, WHICH IT PERCEIVED AS AIMED AGAINST IT, AND </p><p>NEEDED TO BE REASSURED THAT IT APPLIES TO BOTH SIDES. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>SUPPORTING THE GOOD EFFORTS OF KENYA AND IGAD </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  00163  01 OF 02  160239Z </p><p> </p><p>6.   (C) CABRAS SAID THE GOI WAS THINKING OF PROVIDING </p><p>FUNDING FOR STRUCTURAL SUPPORT TO THE INTER-GOVERNMENTAL </p><p>AUTHORITY FOR DEVELOPMENT (IGAD) IN ADDITION TO CURRENT </p><p>HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE AND PEACE PROCESS AID TO IGAD.  HE </p><p>PRAISED IGAD\'S WORK AS MEDIATOR AND KENYAN GEN. SUMBEIYWO\'S </p><p>EFFORTS AS KENYA\'S SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE TO THE TALKS.  THE </p><p>GOI VIEWED THE SUDAN PEACE ACT AS A USEFUL STICK AND WOULD </p><p>OFFER THE GOS THE PROMISE OF AN EU AID PACKAGE, TO BE </p><p>PROVIDED IMMEDIATELY UPON THE CONCLUSION OF AN ACCORD, AS A </p><p>CARROT.  THE GOI WOULD ENSURE THAT THE IMF WAS GIVING THE GOS </p><p>THE SAME MESSAGE.  MCLEAN SUGGESTED THAT AID DISBURSEMENTS BE </p><p>TIED TO PROGRESS IN IMPLEMENTATION, AND CABRAS AGREED, THOUGH </p><p>HE ADDED THAT TIME WOULD TEND TO CONSOLIDATE THE AGREEMENT IN </p><p>PEOPLE\'S MINDS.  CABRAS NOTED THAT THE CONCLUSION OF THE </p><p>AGREEMENT MIGHT WELL BE ON THE GOI WATCH AS EU PRESIDENT </p><p>(JULY TO DECEMBER 2003). </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>THE GOS WILL BE FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGED BY PEACE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>7.
