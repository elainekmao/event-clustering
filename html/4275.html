(SBU) SUMMARY: Following a well-subscribed initial public </p><p>offering (IPO), Jordan Telecom (JTC) stock had its first day </p><p>of public trading on the Amman Stock Exchange (ASE) November </p><p>3.  The listing made JTC the largest company on the ASE in </p><p>terms of operating capital, and placed the Amman bourse among </p><p>the largest in the Middle East.  The success of the IPO, </p><p>which represented 10.5% of the company, has prompted the </p><p>government to consider selling another chunk of JTC stock, </p><p>and perhaps parts of the newly unbundled electric companies, </p><p>via IPOs as early as next year.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>A CLEAR DEMONSTRATION OF INVESTORS\' CONFIDENCE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) Making good on its pledge to accelerate </p><p>privatization, the Government of Jordan put 15% of JTC, </p><p>amounting to 37.5 million shares, on the market October 9 via </p><p>an IPO, the first such offering of state assets to the </p><p>Jordanian public.  Individuals or companies were able to </p><p>subscribe for a minimum of 100 shares, with a three percent </p><p>discount applied to the first 1000 shares purchased by </p><p>individual subscribers.  There was no ceiling on the size of </p><p>investment, and the IPO was open to international and </p><p>domestic investors and institutions.  On October 7, the </p><p>government announced that it set the price range at between </p><p>$3.25 and $3.75  per share, depending on demand.  The </p><p>deadline for participation in the IPO, originally set at </p><p>October 23, was extended by one day.  The final price per </p><p>share, announced October 28, was $3.35. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) According to figures issued by the Securities </p><p>Depository Center (SDC), 26.2 million shares were bought, </p><p>resulting in gross privatization proceeds of $87 million. </p><p>Jordanian and Arab individual purchases accounted for </p><p>approximately 6.7 million of the shares, with 27,000 going to </p><p>ten foreign subscribers.  The SDC said that 49 Jordanian </p><p>institutions and 6 Arab entities purchased the rest, with the </p><p>Social Security Corporation buying the bulk of it at 5%. </p><p>Although the IPO represented only 10.5% of JT, Finance </p><p>Minister Michel Marto termed the IPO a success and called it </p><p>"a clear demonstration of investors\' confidence in our </p><p>economic reforms and privatization program".   As part of the </p><p>offer, JTC announced that shares would be listed on the ASE </p><p>beginning November 4, with an opening price of $3.50. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) Following the sale, the government\'s stake in JTC is </p><p>41.5%, France Telecom\'s remains 40%, the Social Security </p><p>Corporation\'s rises to 12%, with the remaining one percent </p><p>owned by the Jordan Telecom Employees\' Provident Fund. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>A STAR IS BORN? </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) Closing at $3.43, slightly below its opening price, </p><p>JTC shares made their debut as scheduled.  The listing of JTC </p><p>on the ASE made it the second-highest ranked company (out of </p><p>157) on the bourse in terms of market capitalization at </p><p>$821.8 million, and increased the market capitalization of </p><p>the Exchange by more than 10%, making the ASE one of the </p><p>largest bourses in the region.  A total of 56,000 shares </p><p>changed hands the first day.  As of close of business </p><p>November 6, another 49,000 shares had been traded, with the </p><p>stock rising to $3.50 at the closing bell. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>IMPORTANT TO KEEP UP THE MOMENTUM </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) In a briefing given to econoffs on the progress of </p><p>privatization (SEPTEL), Adel Al-Kodah, Chairman of the </p><p>Executive Privatization Commission, said that it was </p><p>"important to keep up the momentum" generated by the IPO.  He </p><p>said that the Commission was planning to offer shares in the </p><p>electricity generation and distribution companies via an IPO </p><p>some time next year.  He added that the government would </p><p>offer the next tranche of another 10 to 15% of its stock in </p><p>JTC through an IPO next year. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) With the pressure of the impact of new entrants </p><p>into the telecom market on the IPO and share prices behind </p><p>it, JTC may now be able to view the Real Time fiber-optic </p><p>cable project a bit more favorably (REF B).  Be that as it </p><p>may, with global interest in telecom stocks limited due to </p><p>the downturn in the sector in general and regional unrest </p><p>making foreign investors chary, the government can consider </p><p>the JTC IPO a success.  Providing investment opportunities </p><p>for day-to-day investors in a sound company such as JTC marks </p><p>specific progress in economic reform and capital market </p><p>expansion.  It also emphasizes the Jordanian Government\'s </p><p>commitment to move ahead on privatization, despite an </p><p>investment atmosphere that is far from ideal.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
