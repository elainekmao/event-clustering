<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 05 ADANA 0025 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EUR/SE AND NEA/NGA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PGOV, TU, SY, IZ, ADANA </p><p>SUBJECT:  THE VIEW FROM SIRNAK PROVINCE: </p><p>"LET US REBUILD THE CHIMNEY-LESS FACTORY" </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary: In southeastern Turkey\'s Sirnak </p><p>province, one of two bordering Iraq, the </p><p>preoccupation of government officials, NGOs, and </p><p>businessmen is less about war than about war\'s </p><p>aftermath.  The populace is desperate to revive </p><p>border trade and commerce.  Kurdish interlocutors </p><p>worry that the GOT might continue to wall off </p><p>northern Iraq in the interest of political-strategic </p><p>considerations, at the expense of the economic well </p><p>being of the region.  GOT officials and Kurdish </p><p>representatives do not seem to gauge some human- </p><p>rights demands - such as language rights and village </p><p>return - with the same scale.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  On January 13-14, Adana Political-Economic </p><p>Officer and FSN Political Assistant paid calls on </p><p>government official, NGOs, and businessmen in Sirnak </p><p>province.  The province has a population of </p><p>approximately 250,000, probably 99 percent Kurdish. </p><p>As a result of the armed struggle with the PKK, the </p><p>province has seen a huge migration of villagers into </p><p>the cities.  Of the twelve southeastern provinces </p><p>placed under a State of Emergency in 1987, Sirnak </p><p>province was one of the last two (the other being </p><p>Diyarbakir province) to have the regime lifted -- on </p><p>November 30, 2002. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Cizre </p><p>:::::::: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  Cizre, located on the banks of the Tigris, </p><p>is the largest city in the province, with a </p><p>population of approximately 110,000.  Its economy </p><p>has become hostage to the vicissitudes of cross- </p><p>border trade between Turkey and northern Iraq. </p><p>Almost certainly the most common profession in Cizre </p><p>is that of trucker.  Rigs of various dimensions are </p><p>everywhere.  At the moment, most are either idle or </p><p>else rusting away in truck mass-graveyards sprinkled </p><p>throughout the surrounding countryside.  As for the </p><p>queue of trucks lined up on the Turkish side waiting </p><p>to cross the nearby Habur gate into northern Iraq, </p><p>we counted no fewer than 150. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  Adnan Elci, president of the Cizre </p><p>Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said the economic </p><p>situation has been bad ever since the Gulf War more </p><p>than a decade ago, and is getting worse.  Prior to </p><p>the events of 9/11, many Cizre-area residents were </p><p>able to make money by hauling goods to northern Iraq </p><p>and bringing back diesel fuel for sale in Turkey - </p><p>technically in contravention of the UN embargo but </p><p>winked at by both Turkish and U.S. authorities.  In </p><p>this diesel trade, truckers could expect to make one </p><p>or two trips per month into northern Iraq.  On that </p><p>basis, a Cizre-based trucker could make a living. </p><p>At its peak, some 40-50,000 trucks were involved in </p><p>the diesel trade.  The closing down of this trade </p><p>after 9/11 brought the local economy to a </p><p>standstill. Elci himself had recently spent a month </p><p>in northern Iraq.  Daily life for residents of </p><p>northern Iraq, according to him, was now better than </p><p>it was for people on the Turkish side of the border </p><p>- an opinion we heard from other interlocutors in </p><p>Sirnak province.  When asked whether he thought the </p><p>new AKP government would do anything from Ankara to </p><p>improve life along the border, he flatly replied no, </p><p>adding that he did not believe that the new </p><p>government had the courage of its convictions.  As </p><p>for the prospect that eventual EU membership for </p><p>Turkey might improve life in Cizre, Elci flatly </p><p>stated that EU membership would never happen. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Silopi </p><p>::::::::: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  The Mayor of Silopi, Neset Oktem (formerly </p><p>DYP, now independent), has been in office for two </p><p>terms.  His city now has perhaps 80,000 residents, a </p><p>very large percentage of whom came as migrants from </p><p>the countryside.  As with Cizre, the economy is a </p><p>border-city economy, and cross-border trade is its </p><p>only "industry," or, as we heard it described, its </p><p>"chimney-less factory."   Silopi is the closest city </p><p>to the Habur gate between Turkey and northern Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  Oktem wants change.  Like many other </p><p>interlocutors in Sirnak Province, he offered his </p><p>hope that war with Iraq could be averted and then </p><p>followed up with a pregnant "but."  Even though </p><p>Silopi has no jobs, people keep coming, in the </p><p>expectation that the border trade sooner or later </p><p>has to revive.  (Note: It is not only rural job- </p><p>seekers who have been coming to Silopi of late. </p><p>Journalists, both foreign and domestic, have been </p><p>thick on the ground lately, we were told.  Unable to </p><p>get permission to go on into northern Iraq, thus </p><p>stranded in Silopi, they have been interviewing </p><p>residents willy-nilly, going so far as to interview </p><p>Silopi primary schoolers about the looming war.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  Oktem saw the re-establishment of border </p><p>trade as the overwhelming priority for the province. </p><p>By comparison, an issue such as Kurdish-language </p><p>rights "gets me no votes," he said.  On this </p><p>particular topic, in fact, the Mayor (who speaks </p><p>Kurdish) showed a flash of indignation.  "Why," he </p><p>asked, "should I be insisting on my children going </p><p>to school in Kurdish?   Why shouldn\'t I be insisting </p><p>that they learn English or French?"  The Mayor, who </p><p>incidentally visited four U.S. cities in 1986 on a </p><p>(non-USG sponsored) Turkish mayors tour, went on to </p><p>make other points that seem more likely to come from </p><p>the mouths of Turkish officials than Kurdish </p><p>activists.  For example, he maintained that it was </p><p>now safe for villagers to return to the villages </p><p>they were forced to abandon during the GOT/PKK </p><p>conflict.   He was passionate in his denouncement of </p><p>jailed PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan, to whom he </p><p>ascribed responsibility for the more than 1,000 </p><p>deaths in his constituency, and vitriolic when </p><p>discussing EU member states that sought to shelter </p><p>Ocalan and his supporters. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) Kemal Palta is a Silopi-based oil-trader who </p><p>owns a fleet of 10 trucks and also recently opened </p><p>up a flourmill.  (Note: Palta\'s office features </p><p>framed certificates from USAID\'s Office of Foreign </p><p>Disaster Assistance for his role in Operations Quick </p><p>Transit I and II in 1996.)   Mr. Palta\'s assessment </p><p>of the current situation on the border was that, as </p><p>war draws nearer, fewer truckers and traders are </p><p>keen on crossing into Iraq. On the question of </p><p>Kurdish-language rights, Palta opined that recent </p><p>GOT reforms were not uppermost in the minds of </p><p>people in the border region.  Not only was their </p><p>primary concern economic survival, their appetite </p><p>for Kurdish-language media can now largely be met by </p><p>technology.  Short-wave radios and satellite TV </p><p>dishes are commonplace, and some people have access </p><p>to Kurdish websites. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU)  Silopi has resident representatives of </p><p>both the International Organization for Migration </p><p>(IOM) and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees </p><p>(UNHCR).  Erdogan Kalkan (UNHCR) and his lawyer </p><p>brother Ihsan Kalkan (IOM Silopi and UNHCR Van) are </p><p>natives of the region who returned after university </p><p>education elsewhere.  In sharing their thoughts </p><p>about the current refugee situation and the possible </p><p>consequences of war, they noted that at the moment </p><p>northern Iraqi Kurds were flowing in both </p><p>directions.  That is, a significant number was now </p><p>returning from Europe in order to resettle in </p><p>northern Iraq.  Erdogan Kalkan cited several </p><p>reasons: they were fed up with their status (or </p><p>"non-status") in various European countries; the </p><p>economic and security situation in northern Iraq had </p><p>improved; families were reuniting; and "Barzani and </p><p>Talabani were calling back their people."   Ihsan </p><p>Kalkan, when asked about UNHCR preparations for </p><p>possible war in Iraq, commented that he believed </p><p>everyone involved in refugee preparations and </p><p>operations was better prepared than they had been in </p><p>1991.  UNHCR had acquired experience, and lessons </p><p>had been learned - not just here but also in other </p><p>hot spots around the world over the past decade. </p><p>UNHCR was also doing preparatory work in northern </p><p>Iraq, specifically in Dohuk and Suleimaniye.  He </p><p>emphasized there still remain too many hypotheticals </p><p>in the mix to be able to predict with certainty how </p><p>many refugees might be generated because of war, </p><p>where they would come from, or where they would be </p><p>received. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sirnak </p><p>::::::::: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U)  Unlike Cizre or Silopi, the city of </p><p>Sirnak, the capital of the province, is up in the </p><p>hills.  It is also smaller; its current population </p><p>is probably about 40,000.  This figure is very much </p><p>an estimate.  It has suffered even more than Cizre </p><p>or Silopi from an influx of people from the </p><p>surrounding countryside, and the strain shows. </p><p>Inspectors recently discovered e. coli bacteria </p><p>contamination in the city\'s drinking water, </p><p>apparently due to a lack of money to pay for </p><p>chlorification.  In the side streets of Sirnak cows </p><p>wander freely and can be seen grazing out of garbage </p><p>dumpsters. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  (SBU)  As the provincial capital, Sirnak houses </p><p>the governor,  Huseyin Baskaya, who has ten years </p><p>experience in the province, having previously served </p><p>as deputy governor.   The Governor prioritizes the </p><p>problems facing the province as follows: 1. </p><p>Commerce, economy, jobs.  2.  Access for livestock </p><p>to high pasturage.  3.  Health and medical services. </p><p>4.  Infrastructure.  5.  Education in general.  As </p><p>for human rights issues - such as torture and </p><p>Kurdish-language rights and village returns - they </p><p>didn\'t make the cut, and he downplayed their </p><p>importance.  He stated that there was no prohibition </p><p>against use of Kurdish in public places, and said </p><p>that Kurdish was freely spoken in his own building. </p><p>There was no longer any restriction against Kurdish </p><p>cassettes or videos, he said. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  (SBU)  As for village returns, Baskaya provided </p><p>the figure of 33 villages in the province to which </p><p>return has been approved.  Of these, eight have seen </p><p>actual return.  Why was the figure not higher?  His </p><p>explanation was that there was only limited demand - </p><p>a theme that other interlocutors in Sirnak province, </p><p>some of them Kurds, echoed.  Those who want to go </p><p>back to their villages were, he said, almost </p><p>exclusively the elderly.  Younger people do not want </p><p>to go back.  Going further, he outlined what he, as </p><p>a representative of the Turkish government, had </p><p>offered to potential returnees.  The government can </p><p>provide roads, sewage, electricity, some basic </p><p>building materials, and leveling of the ground to </p><p>allow for new construction.  His tone implied this </p><p>was a reasonable and generous offer by the state, </p><p>and that it was up to villagers to do the rest.  He </p><p>expressed the belief that many displaced villagers </p><p>had unrealistic expectations that the state could, </p><p>would or should do more.  This belief had perhaps </p><p>been inadvertently encouraged, he noted, by the fact </p><p>that the Sirnak authorities had in fact built a </p><p>couple of "model villages" from scratch not far </p><p>outside of town.  He also expressed suspicion that </p><p>some displaced villagers were not in fact interested </p><p>in village return per se, but rather in acquiring a </p><p>second or "country" house.  He cited an example of a </p><p>villager who sought to have the government pay him </p><p>wages for time spent rebuilding his own house in his </p><p>village.  We raised the question of what kind of </p><p>paperwork, if any, displaced people must submit </p><p>before being able to return to their village.  The </p><p>Governor justified this requirement as being normal </p><p>and sensible.  The State had an obligation to know </p><p>where people were so that it could better protect </p><p>them, he said, whether it be from land mines or the </p><p>depredations of terrorists. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13.  (SBU)  Around the corner from the Governor\'s </p><p>office, in the office of Osman Cihan, the acting </p><p>mayor (HADEP) of Sirnak, one hears a rather </p><p>different take on the current situation.  Cihan said </p><p>the people of Sirnak do not trust the government. </p><p>In the matter of village returns, for example, he </p><p>claimed that the Governor\'s good intentions might be </p><p>one thing - but what about the military?  It was </p><p>ultimately the military that ran the show and </p><p>reserved for itself the final say about permitting </p><p>returns.  The acting mayor\'s figures for number of </p><p>villages opened for return, and number of villages </p><p>to which return has taken place, did not match with </p><p>those of the Governor.  Kurdish-language rights were </p><p>important to the populace, averred Cihan, despite </p><p>what the government might say.  People would indeed </p><p>like to be able to use Kurdish as a language-of- </p><p>instruction in school and be able to use Kurdish in </p><p>court.  One area, however, where the acting mayor </p><p>and the Governor did agree, however, was that the </p><p>number one priority was jobs.  Cihan cited the </p><p>example of a nearby coal mine, where some 400 jobs </p><p>had been lost when the mine was privatized.  The </p><p>ripple effect of that job loss had been enormous in </p><p>an economy as bad off as Sirnak\'s.  (Note:  The </p><p>acting mayor is a former coal miner himself; now he </p><p>handles carbon in a different molecular </p><p>configuration - his other profession is jeweler. </p><p>End note.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14.  (SBU)  Our final call in Sirnak was on Kamil </p><p>Ilhan, the president of the Sirnak Chamber of </p><p>Commerce and Industry.  Ilhan had only recently </p><p>returned from Iraq, in fact, from Baghdad, where he </p><p>had been a member of Trade Minister Suzmen\'s </p><p>delegation. Evidently, the Ministry had not thought </p><p>to include any representatives from southeastern </p><p>Turkey; Ilhan had raised a stink about it and gotten </p><p>himself included.  Rather than fly with the </p><p>delegation, he chose to drive all the way to Baghdad </p><p>and back. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15.   (SBU)  On his drive back to Turkey, Ilhan </p><p>stopped at various places in northern Iraq.  He said </p><p>northern Iraq was running a surplus in a number of </p><p>agricultural items.  In this vein, he showed us a </p><p>list he had prepared of agricultural products from </p><p>northern Iraq that he planned to submit to Ankara </p><p>for import approval.  It was his hope that these </p><p>imported products could be processed in Sirnak.  He </p><p>expressed doubt any such list would be approved by </p><p>Ankara.  Even in a post-Saddam era, he declared, it </p><p>was not clear whether Ankara would welcome bustling </p><p>trade and economic development in the Kurdish region </p><p>of southeastern Turkey and northern Iraq.   When </p><p>asked what his chamber\'s wish list would look like, </p><p>he named four things.  First, free trade across the </p><p>border.  This would bring a huge multiplier effect. </p><p>Truck traffic would spawn all kinds of ancillary </p><p>economic activity, all the way from hotels and </p><p>restaurants through automotive facilities all the </p><p>way to little boys selling ice by the roadside. </p><p>Second, the resumption of the diesel trade - even if </p><p>Iraqis and not just Turks got into the business. </p><p>Third, special concessions to businesses in Sirnak </p><p>province for processing agricultural imports from </p><p>northern Iraq.  These concessions would be </p><p>necessary, he believed, to enable small Sirnak firms </p><p>to stand up to the competition of large Turkish </p><p>firms.  Fourth, permission for cross-border joint </p><p>ventures.  There were so many family and cultural </p><p>links across the Turkey-Iraq border that it would </p><p>make economic sense.  As an example, he mentioned a </p><p>chicken-processing plant he himself had opened in </p><p>Sirnak province a while back, only to have it go </p><p>into the red and fail.  If he could, he would open </p><p>that same business in northern Iraq tomorrow.  That, </p><p>however, he continued, may be precisely what the </p><p>Turkish state feared. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16.  (SBU) Comment:  While the debate about Iraq in </p><p>Turkey and indeed throughout the world often seems </p><p>to turn on questions of morality and international </p><p>law, the view from Sirnak Province is pragmatic and </p><p>it is focused over the horizon.  For one, Saddam </p><p>Hussein is truly hated.  For another, almost </p><p>anything would be better than the ongoing economic </p><p>paralysis.  Turkish officialdom and Kurdish </p><p>activists may not see eye to eye on the importance </p><p>of language rights and village return, but they </p><p>agree that the populace hungers for jobs and </p><p>economic development.  The question being asked by </p><p>people in Sirnak is whether their ties with Kurds </p><p>across the border in Iraq will count as a positive </p><p>or a negative in a post-Saddam era.  End comment. </p><p>HOLTZ </p><p></p></div>
