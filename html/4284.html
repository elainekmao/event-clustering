The meeting was well </p><p>attended by Chiefs of Mission and senior representatives of </p><p>most major donor countries to Zimbabwe.  Key GOZ </p><p>participants included Minister of Labor, Public Works and </p><p>Social Welfare July Moyo and Minister of Health and Child </p><p>Welfare Dr. David Parirenyatwa.  At the outset, both </p><p>ministers thanked donor representatives for their countries\' </p><p>assistance to date, discussed the country crisis and </p><p>response, and concluded with a list of areas of additional </p><p>need.  These initial statements provided little new </p><p>information, largely reiterating information presented in </p><p>prior documentation on these subjects.  Most of the </p><p>subsequent questions and answers covered similarly familiar </p><p>topics, with the ministers\' responses also largely echoing </p><p>past exchanges on these subjects.  Meeting highlights </p><p>included a testy exchange on the "Insiza (World Food </p><p>Programme (WFP) food seizure) incident" which remains </p><p>unresolved, and a coerced announcement that the government </p><p>had agreed to allow Save the Children Federation to resume </p><p>food assistance activities in Binga and Nyaminyami </p><p>Districts.  At the conclusion, all present concurred that it </p><p>had been a useful exchange, and agreed to continue to </p><p>participate in future such meetings on a regular basis. </p><p>This meeting represents an initial attempt by HC Angelo to </p><p>promote a more direct dialogue on humanitarian issues </p><p>between the government and donors.  (Angelo clearly took </p><p>advantage of donor expressions of concern to press the GOZ.) </p><p>The Mission remains sceptical that this new venue will prove </p><p>any more effective than past similar U.N.-brokered </p><p>initiatives at dialogue with the GOZ.  However, the Mission </p><p>will continue to participate, if for no other reason than it </p><p>provides us with a useful venue to put forth our points to </p><p>government on the increasingly desperate situation, and our </p><p>increasingly frustrated efforts to respond to it.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  On November 6, Ambassador Sullivan and A/USAID Director </p><p>attended a meeting, hosted and chaired by the U.N. </p><p>Humanitarian Co-ordinator to Zimbabwe (J. Victor Angelo), </p><p>between major donor country representatives and key GOZ </p><p>officials on the worsening humanitarian crisis in the </p><p>country.  The meeting was the first of a planned series of </p><p>regular such donor-government meetings, in a new HC </p><p>initiative to promote a more direct dialogue between the two </p><p>groups.  The meeting was well attended by Chiefs of Mission </p><p>and senior representatives of most major donor countries to </p><p>Zimbabwe.  GOZ participants included Minister of Labor, </p><p>Public Works and Social Welfare July Moyo, Minister of </p><p>Health and Child Welfare Dr. David Parirenyatwa, and </p><p>associated ministry staff. </p><p> </p><p>3. The meeting started with statements by both ministers </p><p>that thanked donor representatives for their countries\' </p><p>assistance to date, discussed the country crisis and </p><p>response, and concluded with a list of areas of additional </p><p>need.  These rather lengthy initial statements provided </p><p>little new information, largely reiterating information </p><p>presented in prior documentation on these subjects </p><p>(especially the September Zimbabwe Vulnerability Assessment </p><p>Committee (VAC) report and the U.N.\'s Consolidated Appeal </p><p>(CAP) for Zimbabwe - see Reftel). </p><p> </p><p>4.  Most of the subsequent questions and answers (Q&A) </p><p>covered similarly familiar topics, such as the plight of the </p><p>ex-commercial farm workers, NGO registration/approval </p><p>(Germany), politicization of food aid (Sweden, U.S.), </p><p>improved program transparency, information-sharing and </p><p>coordination (especially regarding GOZ/Grain Marketing Board </p><p>(GMB) food aid and sales activities - Britain, U.S.), and </p><p>several statements on respective country contributions to </p><p>date to the humanitarian crisis by the U.S., British and the </p><p>EU.   The ministers\' responses to these questions also </p><p>largely echoed past exchanges on these subjects.  Major </p><p>points of this Q&A included: </p><p>- ex-commercial farm workers could not be singled out for </p><p>special treatment; rather, they must be treated the same as </p><p>others with "no discrimination" within a given area(GOZ). </p><p>As long as this principle was adhered to, there would be no </p><p>problem with assistance to this target group.  In this </p><p>regard, Moyo mentioned the GOZ\'s current UN-supported effort </p><p>to survey farm workers nationwide to get a better idea of </p><p>their numbers, locations, conditions and needs.  [Note:  A </p><p>review of the draft Terms of Reference for this survey </p><p>reveals that the real purpose behind this survey is to </p><p>determine the status of payment of retrenchment packages for </p><p>these workers, presumably so that additional pressure can </p><p>placed on commercial farmers (and Britain?) to own up to </p><p>this government-imposed responsibility.  End Note.] </p><p>- many of the current problems with coordination and </p><p>purported "politicization" of humanitarian assistance </p><p>resulted from NGO activities that were not duly approved by </p><p>central government or implemented through </p><p>accepted/established local government structures.  Hence, </p><p>all programs must be reviewed and approved by central </p><p>government, and implemented through established local </p><p>structures to avoid these problems.  Government would </p><p>continue its best efforts to enlist the support of </p><p>additional NGOs, who followed these procedures, to assist in </p><p>the relief effort. </p><p>- "politicization of assistance" was an "emotional" and </p><p>"highly distorted" issue due to the current polarized </p><p>political environment.  Hence, there was a need for prompt </p><p>reporting and joint investigation of reported incidents to </p><p>ensure that the facts were ascertained, "false" reports were </p><p>quickly quashed and appropriate corrective measures could be </p><p>effected in a timely manner. </p><p>- good information and coordination of government programs </p><p>(especially the GMB) was hampered by various operational </p><p>constraints, such as unpredictability of supplies, </p><p>logistical bottlenecks, etc.  However, within these </p><p>constraints, government would endeavour to provide better </p><p>information on their program operations in the interest of </p><p>avoiding duplication and maximizing the effectiveness of </p><p>limited aid resources. </p><p>- major new donor commitments noted included the long- </p><p>awaited arrival of some $26 million in critical medicines, </p><p>and the provision of additional equipment and supplies to </p><p>the country\'s central blood transfusion unit - both by the </p><p>EU. </p><p> </p><p>5.   Meeting highlights included a brief and testy exchange </p><p>on the "Insiza incident", where approximately 3 MT of WFP </p><p>food commodities (including some U.S.-donated vegetable oil) </p><p>were seized by ruling party supporters in several wards in </p><p>the run-up to the recent Parliamentary by-election in this </p><p>district.  In response to the U.S. Ambassador\'s query on the </p><p>status of this issue, following HC Angelo\'s confirmation </p><p>that WFP food distributions remained suspended in this </p><p>district, Minister Moyo indicated the results of his </p><p>personal investigations into these incidents, characterizing </p><p>them as "complicated" and unfortunate "errors of judgement." </p><p>In response to the Ambassador\'s query on plans for the </p><p>restitution of the stolen commodities, the Minister stated </p><p>that it was better not to dwell on restitution (read </p><p>"retribution") for past mistakes, but rather to move forward </p><p>with "lessons learned" for avoiding such incidents in the </p><p>future.   It was clear following this exchange that this </p><p>issue remains unresolved, much to the chagrin of the GOZ and </p><p>their party supporters within this district. (On the weekend </p><p>following this meeting, State media claimed that agreement </p><p>had been reached to resume food deliveries in Insiza, a </p><p>claim rebutted by HC who told the Ambassador that issues of </p><p>restitution must be addressed as well as correct </p><p>acknowledgement by GOZ of the source of the cutoff.) </p><p> </p><p>6. Near the end of the meeting, Minister Moyo announced an </p><p>agreement by all levels of government to allow Save the </p><p>Children Federation (SCF/UK) to resume food distribution and </p><p>supplementary feeding activities in Binga and Nyaminyami </p><p>Districts, following an almost two-month cessation for </p><p>"political reasons" after the local government elections at </p><p>end-August.  It is significant to note, however, that </p><p>Minister Moyo only made this welcome announcement under </p><p>pressure from HC Angelo.  The Embassy learned Nov 11 from UN </p><p>that SCF/UK is re-mobilizing staff now in preparation for </p><p>the resumption of food distribution and feeding activities </p><p>on Nov 13.  End Note.] </p><p> </p><p>7. At the meeting\'s conclusion, all present concurred that </p><p>it had been a useful exchange, with a generally constructive </p><p>ambience, and agreed to continue to participate in future </p><p>such meetings on a regular basis. </p><p> </p><p>8. Comment:  This meeting represents an initial attempt by </p><p>HC Angelo to promote a more direct dialogue on humanitarian </p><p>issues between the government and donors.  Through this </p><p>initiative, Angelo seems to be trying to re-engage </p><p>government/donors at some level through a dialogue on issues </p><p>surrounding this somewhat less controversial area of </p><p>bilateral relations, as well as trying to extricate himself </p><p>from the center of difficult dialogue between government and </p><p>donors.  As a first attempt, the meeting went well, with a </p><p>reasonable exchange of views on several important subjects. </p><p>Even the testy exchange on politicization of food assistance </p><p>was important for the Government to hear. We are not </p><p>optimistic that this initiative will prove any more </p><p>effective than past similar U.N.-brokered initiatives at </p><p>dialogue with the GOZ.  However, the Mission will continue </p><p>to participate to put forth our points to government on the </p><p>increasingly desperate country situation, and our </p><p>increasingly frustrated efforts to respond to it. </p><p>Sullivan# </p><p></p></div>
