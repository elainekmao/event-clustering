<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 GUATEMALA 000128 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR WHA/CEN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/14/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINR, SNAR, GT </p><p>SUBJECT: PAN IN THE PROCESS OF OVERCOMING INTERNAL RIVALRY </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. 02 GUATEMALA 2891 </p><p> </p><p>     B. 02 GUATEMALA 2977 </p><p>     C. 02 GUATEMALA 3158 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Officer Erik Hall for reason 1.5 (d) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary:  The National Advancement Party\'s two rival </p><p>leaders, presidential candidate Oscar Berger and party </p><p>Secretary General Leonel Lopez Rodas, announced their accord </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>to work together in support of Berger\'s presidential </p><p>candidacy.  In a symbolic media event on January 13, </p><p>bulldozers demolished a cement block wall between PAN </p><p>headquarters and the adjacent Berger campaign office.  The </p><p>deal worked out between the two men consolidates the support </p><p>of Lopez loyalists for Berger\'s presidential candidacy in </p><p>exchange for Berger\'s support for other candidacies backed by </p><p>Lopez.  While details about the deal are partial, they </p><p>apparently include an even split of Congressional </p><p>candidacies, consensual decision-making in the PAN\'s </p><p>executive committee, and future consideration of an accord on </p><p>the vice presidency and mayoralty of the capital.  Key </p><p>private sector backers of Berger are happy with the accord, </p><p>and some hope Berger will now reach outside the PAN in </p><p>selecting his running-mate.  By assuring party unity for the </p><p>moment, the agreement between the two men boosts Berger\'s </p><p>presidential prospects.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Background </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) The PAN\'s November primary generated significant </p><p>animosity between the two leaders of the Party -- Oscar </p><p>Berger and Leonel Lopez (see RefTels -- and neither side </p><p>sought a rapprochement with the other in the early days after </p><p>the election.  Despite Berger\'s overwhelming primary victory, </p><p>Lopez Rodas continued to exercise significant control over </p><p>the party organization through his influence with its local </p><p>affiliates and his majority in the party\'s Executive </p><p>Committee.  Several of Berger\'s financial backers echoed the </p><p>views of a Prensa Libre editorial calling on Berger to broker </p><p>peace with Lopez in order to preserve party unity.  They </p><p>argued that Berger\'s unwillingness to make concessions to </p><p>Lopez threatened to split the party, making a loss in the </p><p>national elections more likely. </p><p> </p><p>The Deal:  Lopez Rodas\' Version </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Leonel Lopez Rodas told us on January 12 that he and </p><p>Oscar Berger had reached a firm agreement on the following: </p><p> </p><p>--  They will name an equal number of congressional </p><p>candidates on the national list with Berger getting even </p><p>numbers and Lopez getting odd numbers.  The same applies to </p><p>the list for congressmen representing Guatemala City. </p><p> </p><p>--  Mauricio Urruela (a Lopez supporter) is the candidate for </p><p>mayor of Guatemala City (for now).  He will receive the full </p><p>support of the party.  In early April, the PAN will conduct a </p><p>poll, and if it looks as if Urruela will not win, he will be </p><p>replaced by Berger\'s candidate, Eduardo Castillo. </p><p> </p><p>--  Lopez Rodas is the favorite to become the Vice </p><p>Presidential candidate.  However, if by April it looks as if </p><p>the PAN needs to bring in someone from outside to boost their </p><p>chances, then Lopez and Berger will make a decision on who to </p><p>ultimately fill this slot. </p><p> </p><p>-- Lopez considers Berger\'s campaign manager, banker Eduardo </p><p>Gonzalez, to be the main barrier to effective communication </p><p>and collaboration between his camp and Berger\'s.  Lopez </p><p>believes Gonzalez has been the strongest advocate of not </p><p>making concessions to Lopez that could later undermine </p><p>Berger\'s ability to carry out his own plan of government if </p><p>elected. </p><p> </p><p>The Deal:  View from Berger Supporters </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) The Berger-Lopez Rodas agreement is viewed somewhat </p><p>differently by Berger supporters.  Carlos Arias, CACIF\'s </p><p>Labor Commission chief and purportedly a political strategist </p><p>for Berger\'s major sponsors, gave PolOff a different account </p><p>of the Berger-Lopez Rodas deal in a discussion on January 10. </p><p> The sponsors, which Arias refers to as the "organized </p><p>private sector" (SPO), is comprised of the Gutierrez-Bosch </p><p>clan and others, including Peter Lamport, who acts as the </p><p>group\'s international affairs person.  Cement king Enrique </p><p>Novella was part of the team before he died in a plane crash </p><p>in El Salvador late in 2002.  According to Arias: </p><p> </p><p>--  The SPO is happy that Berger has accommodated Lopez </p><p>Rodas.  The deal includes an even split of Congressional </p><p>candidates and consensual decision-making in the PAN </p><p>executive committee (Lopez Rodas had a one-vote margin of </p><p>control there, but has agreed that Berger will be added to </p><p>the group). </p><p>--  The Vice Presidency is not part of the bargain.  That </p><p>issue will be revisited in March or April.  Arias implied </p><p>that there was an agreement that the Vice Presidential </p><p>candidate should come from outside the PAN (ruling out Lopez </p><p>Rodas).  Ideally, it would be someone who could first unify </p><p>the small third parties and bring leftist votes to Berger. </p><p>Arias said his personal preference would be Alvaro Colom. </p><p>There have also been talks with Mayan organizations about </p><p>Rigoberto Queme, the indigenous Mayor of Quetzaltenango. </p><p>(Comment:  Queme has registered a party to give him an option </p><p>to run for president.  End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p>--  Arias said that the PAN\'s candidate for Mayor of </p><p>Guatemala City was also not part of the Lopez Rodas-Berger </p><p>deal.  He noted that Prensa Libre had a story saying Berger </p><p>had selected Mauricio Urruela as his preferred candidate. </p><p>Arias called Urruela "a thief" from a good family who is </p><p>hated by the SPO.  He called the press article a trial </p><p>balloon. </p><p> </p><p>--  Asked what role Eduardo Gonzalez would have in a </p><p>potential Berger administration, Arias said Gonzalez would </p><p>run it from within.  He credited Gonzalez with engineering </p><p>Berger\'s primary victory. </p><p> </p><p>--  The SPO invested heavily in the PAN primaries, and also </p><p>contracted a U.S. political consultant and Felipe Noguera, an </p><p>Argentine based in Miami for technical assistance.  For now, </p><p>they have retained only Noguera\'s services. </p><p> </p><p>--  SPO members recognize that to recoup power they must </p><p>focus on the 2003 election (supporting Berger) while also </p><p>looking beyond the presidency and cultivating Congressional </p><p>deputies in as many parties as possible.  They are now </p><p>totally committed to legal, constitutional pursuit of lasting </p><p>influence in the GOG, "whatever their attitudes may have been </p><p>in the past." </p><p> </p><p>--  The immediate task now is to finalize Berger\'s political </p><p>platform.  In parallel, the SPO will also produce its own </p><p>proposals on a plan of government, including how to finance </p><p>it, and distribute it to all political parties. </p><p> </p><p>--  With the new accommodation between Lopez Rodas and </p><p>Berger, the main losers, according to Arias, will be the </p><p>Unionist party.  The Unionist split from the PAN was a </p><p>reaction by former president Arzu against Lopez Rodas.  While </p><p>some Unionists will return to the PAN to support Berger </p><p>nevertheless, some Unionists closest to Arzu will not be </p><p>welcomed by Lopez Rodas. </p><p> </p><p>--  According to Arias the SPO\'s "kings" of the private </p><p>sector have changed their thinking:  first, by deciding to </p><p>work together for mutual rather than private interests, and </p><p>second, to accommodate to new rules of the game under </p><p>globalization by seeking influence by operating within the </p><p>democratic system.  He believes it is in the interest of the </p><p>SPO for the USG to be aware of this democratic evolution and </p><p>hopefully to welcome it. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Note:  Felipe Noguera, the Argentine consultant, has </p><p>a long history as consultant to El Salvador\'s ARENA party, </p><p>according to Pollo Campero magnate Juan Luis Bosch in a </p><p>conversation with EconCouns.  ARENA is the political model </p><p>the SPO is emulating, including its support for Berger and </p><p>the PAN, and resuscitating the local pro-private sector think </p><p>tank FUNDESA as a copy of El Salvador\'s FUSADES.  Bosch paid </p><p>for Noguera\'s participation in CACIF\'s general annual </p><p>assembly a year ago, which was orchestrated around </p><p>presentations by Noguera y Associates that purported, by </p><p>"scientific" and "objective" criteria, to show that the PAN </p><p>was the only option for right-thinking Guatemalans.  End </p><p>Note. </p><p> </p><p>Berger Campaign Worried About Possible Narco-Financing </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) We met on January 13 with Eduardo Gonzalez, Berger\'s </p><p>campaign manager, at his request.  Gonzalez is worried that </p><p>the Berger campaign will be offered financing from dubious </p><p>sources that might have links to illegal activities, and </p><p>asked for Embassy assistance in "vetting" contributors.  We </p><p>informed Gonzalez that the Embassy can not vet their campaign </p><p>contributors, and urged the PAN to check out campaign </p><p>contributors locally, as their supporters in distant areas </p><p>were likely to know who is a druggie and who isn\'t, and to </p><p>just say "no" if they have any doubts. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Gonzalez also said that Berger is worried about how </p><p>to limit the influence of organized crime in their </p><p>government.  We responded that the key is appointing honest, </p><p>reliable, incorruptible Ministers of Government and Defense, </p><p>passing effective conspiracy legislation, and pressing the </p><p>Courts and Public Ministry for results.  Gonzalez said that </p><p>Berger is determined to carry out a profound reform of the </p><p>military, but that he would want USG advice in the process. </p><p>Once in Government, he said, Berger would need counsel from </p><p>the USG on which officers are close to Ortega Menaldo. </p><p>Gonzalez added that he is worried about the possible use of </p><p>violence by organized crime to keep Berger from taking </p><p>office. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) The Berger-Lopez Rodas agreement is an important </p><p>milestone for Berger, who emerges considerably strengthened </p><p>by the alliance.  On January 15 a major national daily </p><p>supporting Berger reported polls showing Berger way ahead in </p><p>popular preferences, at 45%, followed by Colom, with 9.7% and </p><p>the FRG\'s Rios Montt at only 2.6% (Note: Guatemalan polls are </p><p>not historically reliable.  End Note).  A good vice </p><p>presidential pick would further boost Berger\'s chances. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) Berger also emerges from the accord hostage to Lopez </p><p>Rodas\' influence until the election.  Lopez Rodas detests </p><p>Gonzalez, who is widely viewed as the power behind the Berger </p><p>throne.  We suspect that Gonzalez will play a far greater </p><p>role in a Berger government, should it come about, than Lopez </p><p>Rodas.  Lopez knows that after the election he will be of </p><p>less value to Berger unless he is able to establish a firm </p><p>base in Congress for his allies.  Gonzalez is not only the </p><p>architect of Berger\'s campaign, he is also the guy CACIF and </p><p>the SPO trusts to keep the next government running in their </p><p>direction. </p><p>Hamilton </p><p></p></div>
