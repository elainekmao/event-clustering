Boggs, for reasons 1.5(b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY: Nepal\'s Minister for Water Resources Dipak </p><p>Gyawali is sharply critical of India\'s policies on </p><p>cross-border energy trade.  He told us that he believes New </p><p>Delhi focuses on the strategic aspects of water and energy to </p><p>the exclusion of economics.  Despite Nepal\'s current power </p><p>surplus, Gyawali understands that Nepal will need to develop </p><p>storage capacity in the future, in addition to slated </p><p>run-of-the-river projects, in order to compensate for the </p><p>high seasonal variability of water flows.  He believes that </p><p>joint venture models have the greatest potential for tapping </p><p>Nepal\'s huge hydroelectric potential.  In our view, India\'s </p><p>resistance to joining South Asian regional initiatives is </p><p>holding back the economic development of both countries and </p><p>will impede national as well as donor-funded efforts to </p><p>alleviate South Asia\'s poverty.  Please see action request </p><p>for Department and Embassy New Delhi in final paragraph.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Water Resources Minister: India "Resistant to Economics" </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) In the context of the recent SARI/E-sponsored Energy </p><p>Information Administration (EIA) regional workshop in </p><p>Kathmandu, SARI/Energy regional Coordinator, SARI/E Nepal </p><p>coordinator, and Kathmandu-based Regional Environment Officer </p><p>(REO) had a private dialogue with Water Resources Minister </p><p>Dipak Gyawali and Secretary for Water Resources Keshab Chand. </p><p> Gyawali (in typically outspoken fashion) sharply criticized </p><p>India\'s policy on regional energy trading, saying that India </p><p>was not just resistant to cross-border cooperation, but </p><p>"resistant to economics."  Gyawali stated that as long as </p><p>India continued to view water and energy in purely strategic </p><p>(and not economic) terms, there would be little progress in </p><p>bilateral energy trading, and hence little opportunity for </p><p>Nepal to develop its energy exports. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) When asked about Nepal supplying India\'s enormous </p><p>future power needs, Gyawali pointed out that many Indian </p><p>states provide free (or nearly free) power to certain favored </p><p>customers, such as farmers.  "If the price is zero, then </p><p>obviously the demand will be infinite."  The Minister cited a </p><p>recent example where India had cut back on minuscule </p><p>purchases of a few kilowatts of power in border areas.  "So </p><p>if they don\'t need five kilowatts, then don\'t tell me they </p><p>need 40,000 megawatts." </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Gyawali conceded that although Nepal currently </p><p>enjoys a surplus of supply for its grid, he expects the </p><p>situation to turn around in 2-3 years.  Nepal will need more </p><p>run-of-the river projects in the 100-MW range, but also </p><p>storage capacity to deal with seasonal variations.  Joint </p><p>ventures have the greatest potential for mobilizing the </p><p>necessary capital, he thought.  He said that Nepal needs to </p><p>know more about both the irrigation and power systems of </p><p>Uttar Pradesh and Bihar in order to estimate the scope for </p><p>future cooperation with India.  (The Minister left soon </p><p>thereafter for an official visit to Patna, capital of Bihar.) </p><p> </p><p>MEA Mandarins Circling the Wagons? </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) In a subsequent conversation, managing Director </p><p>General Janak Lal Karmacharya of the Nepal Electricity </p><p>Authority (NEA, which comes under Gyawali\'s Water resources </p><p>Ministry) told SARI representatives that Nepalese officials </p><p>were still upset over the treatment meted out to the Nepali </p><p>delegation at an aborted U.S.-Nepal-India hydropower </p><p>partnership meeting in New Delhi in November 2002.  (Note: </p><p>the event was aimed at technical management improvement, not </p><p>power trade.  India boycotted the meeting, even though the </p><p>Nepalis had already arrived.)  However, he felt that we </p><p>should take a long-term view, preparing the ground for future </p><p>cooperation, but not expecting early breakthroughs. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Department of Electricity Development Director </p><p>General Lekh Man Singh told us that progress on the Arun III </p><p>cascade project, expected to provide a total of 402 MW, was </p><p>glacial.  The GOI still had to agree in order for Nepal to </p><p>activate a USD 10 million Asian Development Bank credit to </p><p>update technical and engineering studies which could </p><p>eventually lead to ADB financing of the project.  Further, </p><p>Indian MEA officials had attempted to block the Australian </p><p>West Seti project (750 MW) on the grounds that India should </p><p>not pay foreign exchange for Nepali power when there were </p><p>still possible hydro sites to develop in India.  According to </p><p>Singh, only a high-level intervention by Nepali officials </p><p>with Indian ForMin Yashwant Sinha succeeded in getting this </p><p>decision reversed.  He believed that the MEA mandarins might </p><p>try again to short-circuit the project when it gets to the </p><p>Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) stage. </p><p> </p><p>Divide and Conquer Strategy Appears Anachronistic </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) COMMENT: India\'s preference for dealing with its </p><p>neighbors on a bilateral basis extends well beyond the issue </p><p>of energy, and certainly beyond USAID\'s regional energy </p><p>program.  There will be little immediate impact on the </p><p>prospects for a regional power pool or bilateral work in the </p><p>hydropower sector, since India has participated minimally in </p><p>SARI/E programs aimed at this aspect to date.  If one of </p><p>SARI\'s objectives is, however, to engender a more productive </p><p>atmosphere for energy trading negotiations between India and </p><p>Nepal, much more clearly needs to be done.  Fortunately, </p><p>there is much more to SARI.  From Nepal\'s perspective, SARI </p><p>provides numerous other benefits in training and technical </p><p>information sharing with regional counterparts with or </p><p>without India.  Further, such activities supplement our </p><p>bilateral efforts.  We therefore support SARI/E\'s </p><p>continuation, although the focus on regional energy trading </p><p>may need to be revamped in favor of sector reform </p><p>initiatives.  The door must be left open for India to </p><p>re-think its bilateral-only approach. </p><p> </p><p>The Emperor Has No Clothes </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) COMMENT CONTINUED: However, we remain deeply </p><p>concerned over India\'s apparent unwillingness to collaborate </p><p>fully in regional efforts which stand to bring much-needed, </p><p>long-term benefit to poverty-stricken Nepal.  Indeed, </p><p>indications are multiplying that India will resist </p><p>participating in any forum organized by the U.S. that has </p><p>only South Asian countries as participants.  The hamstringing </p><p>of Nepal\'s efforts to realize its enormous hydroelectric </p><p>potential by its only market is a major obstacle to Nepal\'s </p><p>development prospects.  This is particularly costly at a time </p><p>when low standards of living and lack of economic opportunity </p><p>in the countryside are fueling an insurrection that is </p><p>sending Nepal backward. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) ACTION REQUEST FOR DEPARTMENT AND NEW DELHI: There is </p><p>a considerable U.S. investment to protect in this regional </p><p>initiative.  We believe the U.S. has a strong interest in </p><p>promoting regional cohesion and alleviating South Asia\'s </p><p>crushing poverty.  It would therefore be in the U.S. interest </p><p>to try to wean the GOI, especially the MEA, from its </p><p>anachronistic insistence on bilateral approaches to regional </p><p>problems -- which has long been a source of irritation to </p><p>India\'s smaller neighbors, such as Nepal.  Department and </p><p>Embassy New Delhi may wish to consider how best to further </p><p>the objectives of SARI and other USG-sponsored regional </p><p>initiatives through a discreet but consistent dialogue with </p><p>decision-makers in MEA and other GOI power centers. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
