REASONS: 1.5 </p><p>(B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) ACCORDING TO PRESS ACCOUNTS, MOVEMENT FOR </p><p>DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC) PRESIDENT MORGAN TSVANGIRAI WAS, ON </p><p>FEBRUARY 15, FORMALLY CHARGED UNDER THE COLONIAL-ERA LAW </p><p>AND ORDER MAINTENANCE ACT WITH INCITING VIOLENCE.  THE </p><p>CHARGE REFERS TO TSVANGIRAI\'S REMARK AT A PUBLIC RALLY LAST </p><p>SEPTEMBER 30 THAT, IF PRESIDENT MUGABE DID NOT GO </p><p>PEACEFULLY, "WE WILL REMOVE YOU VIOLENTLY."  ALTHOUGH </p><p>TSVANGIRAI\'S STATEMENT WAS CARELESS, HE AND OTHER MDC </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>OFFICIALS HAVE SINCE CLARIFIED, ON NUMEROUS PUBLIC AND </p><p>PRIVATE OCCASIONS, THAT HE MEANT THAT, IF THE PRESIDENT DID </p><p>NOT STAND DOWN SOON, A PUBLIC ANGRY AND FRUSTRATED BY THE </p><p>BREAKDOWN IN THE RULE OF LAW AND THE SERIOUS ECONOMIC </p><p>DECLINE WOULD FORCE HIM FROM OFFICE.  TSVANGIRAI WAS </p><p>REPORTEDLY ASKED BY THE HARARE MAGISTRATES COURT TO PAY </p><p>Z$10,000 (US $150) IN BAIL AND ORDERED TO STAND TRIAL IN </p><p>THE HIGH COURT ON APRIL 30. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) MDC SPOKESMAN LEARNMORE JONGWE CONFIRMED THE PRESS </p><p>ACCOUNTS IN A FEBRUARY 16 CONVERSATION WITH US.  JONGWE </p><p>TOLD US THAT THE MDC LEADERSHIP HAS NOT DECIDED YET HOW IT </p><p>WILL RESPOND TO THE FILING OF THE CHARGE.  TWO </p><p>POSSIBILITIES, HE SAID, ARE CHALLENGING THE </p><p>CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE LAW AND ORDER MAINTENANCE ACT OR </p><p>ACTUALLY PROCEEDING TO TRIAL AND REFUTING THE CHARGE AT </p><p>THAT STAGE.  THE MDC\'S EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE HAS SCHEDULED A </p><p>MEETING FOR FEBRUARY 21 TO DECIDE HOW TO PROCEED. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00767  161156Z </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN HOLDING THIS POTENTIAL </p><p>CHARGE OVER TSVANGIRAI\'S HEAD FOR NEARLY FIVE MONTHS.  THE </p><p>FACT THAT IT HAS NOW DECIDED TO PROCEED WITH A CASE IS </p><p>EVIDENCE THAT THE GOZ INTENDS TO TURN UP THE HEAT FURTHER </p><p>ON THE MDC\'S LEADERSHIP.  ALTHOUGH WE ANTICIPATE THE COURT </p><p>LIKELY WILL DISMISS THE CHARGE, THIS DEVELOPMENT FOLLOWS </p><p>LAST WEEK\'S POLICE DETENTIONS OF MDC VICE-PRESIDENT GIBSON </p><p>SIBANDA AND NATIONAL YOUTH LEADER NELSON CHAMISA, AND THE </p><p>BEATING OF MDC SECRETARY FOR SECURITY JOB SIKHALA BY MEN IN </p><p>ARMY UNIFORMS.  THE RECENT MOVES AGAINST THE MDC, THE </p><p>INDEPENDENT MEDIA AND THE JUDICIARY, COMBINED WITH CALLS </p><p>THIS WEEK BY SENIOR ZANU-PF OFFICIALS FOR DENYING PASSPORTS </p><p>TO OPPOSITION SUPPORTERS AND BLACKLISTING LAW FIRMS </p><p>SUSPECTED OF SUPPORTING THE OPPOSITION, ARE SIGNS OF AN </p><p>INCREASINGLY DESPERATE GOVERNMENT. </p><p> </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
