The situation in northern Iraq remains calm.  On 5 May, DART </p><p>Team North visited Mosul for the first time.  The climate in the </p><p>city appears vibrant and bustling, and there is a large Coalition </p><p>presence.  Delegates representing a cross-section of Mosul\'s </p><p>religious and ethnic groups elected 24 town council </p><p>representatives, an interim mayor who is a retired army general, </p><p>and a deputy mayor on 5 May.  CMOC-Mosul reported that of the </p><p>thirteen hospitals in the city, seven are functioning.  Kurdish </p><p>residents forced out of villages by the former regime more than </p><p>two decades ago are now beginning to return.  WFP has </p><p>approximately 13,000 MT of food commodities in Mosul, and there </p><p>is an estimated 250,000 MT of wheat stored in the Mosul silos, </p><p>but its condition is unknown.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>MOSUL TOWN COUNCIL ELECTED </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  On 5 May, delegates representing a cross-section of Mosul\'s </p><p>religious and ethnic groups elected 24 town council </p><p>representatives, an interim mayor who is a retired army general, </p><p>and a deputy mayor.  The proceedings went smoothly, although some </p><p>delegates are said to have walked out because the council was </p><p>divided along ethnic lines.  The delegates and elected mayor </p><p>received standing ovations from the delegation of more than 200. </p><p>Representatives from the Office of Reconstruction and </p><p>Humanitarian Assistance (ORHA) and the Civil Military Operations </p><p>Center (CMOC)-Mosul also attended. </p><p> </p><p>------ </p><p>HEALTH </p><p>------ </p><p> </p><p>3.  The DART attended a health sector meeting on 4 May.  Hosted </p><p>by Northwest Medical Teams International (NWMTI), the meeting was </p><p>attended by non-governmental organizations (NGOs) active in the </p><p>health sector, CMOC, and a representative of the Department of </p><p>Health in Arbil. </p><p> </p><p>4.  NGOs summarized their activities, paying particular attention </p><p>to the "newly-liberated" areas of Arbil Governorate and aid to </p><p>medical facilities in Mosul.  CMOC was represented by officers </p><p>from the Erbil, Mosul, and Kirkuk offices; briefings were given </p><p>on the situation in Kirkuk and Mosul. </p><p> </p><p>5.  CMOC has been assessing medical facilities in Kirkuk and </p><p>offered to assist NGOs in coordinating their efforts in that </p><p>city.  They reported that the central medical distribution system </p><p>in the city is intact and functioning.  Hospitals and clinics are </p><p>pleased with the system, CMOC said, although some outlying areas </p><p>report problems. </p><p> </p><p>6.  CMOC-Mosul reported that of the thirteen hospitals in the </p><p>city, seven are functioning.  Staffing needs are being met, </p><p>although there are problems with, among other things, salaries </p><p>and transportation.  Current needs include equipment and medical </p><p>supplies.  A priority in the Mosul medical community is to repair </p><p>and renovate the infectious disease hospital. </p><p> </p><p>7.  On 5 May, the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG), Minister </p><p>of Health and Social Affairs, chaired a meeting of NGOs currently </p><p>working in Arbil and Dahuk Governorates.  The Minister informed </p><p>NGOs that the Ministry should identify health needs and </p><p>coordinate NGO activities in this sector.  He went on to say that </p><p>the Ministry would support and facilitate NGO efforts to meet </p><p>these needs.  The Minister thanked NWMTI for chairing previous </p><p>meetings, but he made it clear that the Ministry would chair </p><p>future health sector meetings. </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>RETURNING IDPS </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  Two meetings were held at the KRG Ministry of Reconstruction </p><p>and Development (MORAD) on 3 and 4 May to address a MORAD </p><p>proposal to reconstruct villages in southern Arbil Governorate. </p><p>Approximately 40 villages in the area were "Arabized" more than </p><p>two decades ago by the Saddam regime, which controlled the area </p><p>until recently.  Kurdish residents were forced out of the </p><p>villages and have been internally displaced in Arbil and </p><p>elsewhere in the Kurdish-controlled region.  They are now </p><p>beginning to return to those villages.  The Minister has asked UN </p><p>agencies and NGOs to visit the villages to assess needs and </p><p>participate in the rebuilding of the region.  The visit is </p><p>scheduled for 6 May. </p><p> </p><p>---- </p><p>FOOD </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p>9.  During the visit to Mosul, a DART food officer met with U.N. </p><p>World Food Program (WFP) local staff.  WFP has approximately </p><p>13,000 metric tons (MT) of food commodities in Mosul.  The Iraqi </p><p>Ministry of Trade (MOT) has other stocks (left over from the </p><p>interrupted March distribution) and there is possibly an </p><p>estimated 250,000 MT of wheat stored in the Mosul silos.  The </p><p>grain\'s condition is unknown.  Coalition forces and the MOT are </p><p>considering distribution of the MOT warehouse stocks.  The silos </p><p>are generally functional but are in need of some maintenance. </p><p>Eleven of the thirteen mills in the area are functioning.  They </p><p>are privately owned and were protected from looting.  Of the </p><p>remaining silos, one is now controlled by Coalition forces and </p><p>the other is controlled by the Peshmerga. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>CMOC - NGO COORDINATION MEETING </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  Also on 5 May, the DART attended the first CMOC/NGO </p><p>coordination meeting in Mosul.  In contrast to coordination </p><p>meetings in Arbil, attended by over a dozen NGOs, only three NGOs </p><p>attended the coordination meeting in Mosul.  Of the three </p><p>present, only Qandil is currently working in Mosul.  CMOC </p><p>provided security information, as well as general information in </p><p>a number of sectors, including health and education.  There seems </p><p>to be some confusion among the NGOs as to CMOC\'s role.  At one </p><p>point, Dutch Consortium asked if they now had permission to work </p><p>in Mosul.  CMOC explained they do not control NGO activities and </p><p>aimed to help NGOs work safely throughout the region.  CMOC was </p><p>unaware of several key issues related to NGOs\' ability to work in </p><p>northern Iraq, including the relationship between a city being </p><p>deemed permissive and the inability of civilian aircraft to fly </p><p>into Iraq.  These meetings are expected to be a weekly event. </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
