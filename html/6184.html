<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HANOI 000551 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV AND DRL/IRF </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, KIRF, PINS, SOCI, VM, ETMIN, HUMANR, RELFREE </p><p>SUBJECT:  Reported attempts at forced renunciation of faith </p><p> </p><p>Ref:  Hanoi 0349 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  A reliable contact within the Evangelical Church </p><p>of Vietnam - North (ECVN) provided Embassy with copies of 13 </p><p>handwritten letters from Hmong Protestants in the Northwest </p><p>Highlands province of Lao Cai, detailing harassment by local </p><p>authorities and attempts at forced renunciation of faith. </p><p>All letters were apparently written in mid-February; many </p><p>indicate that pressures were especially notable in October </p><p>and November 2002.   The letters uniformly request help from </p><p>the UN, the ECVN, and the world protestant council (sic) to </p><p>"resolve" their problems.  Many letters note that, although </p><p>their churches had been recognized by the ECVN, the </p><p>government refused to accept this affiliation.  Several </p><p>letters reported authorities confiscating Bibles, hymnbooks, </p><p>and even tables and chairs.  (Septel will report on poloff\'s </p><p>February visit to Lao Cai, which unfortunately preceded our </p><p>receipt of these reports.  When poloff asked about similar </p><p>problems other Lao Cai Protestants had earlier reported, </p><p>provincial authorities denied the existence of Protestants </p><p>in their jurisdiction.) </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  The letters come from individuals in several </p><p>villages in four of Lao Cai\'s nine districts: Bao Thang, Bao </p><p>Yen, Van Ban, and Bac Ha.  One Protestant from Thai Nien </p><p>commune in Bao Thang district claimed a 100-person </p><p>"delegation to forbid faith" composed of commune, district, </p><p>and provincial officials had arrived in the commune on </p><p>October 6, 2002, while another smaller group came on October </p><p>10.  They told people not to pray and claimed that following </p><p>Protestantism was really "following America," since </p><p>"America" was spreading this faith to undermine the </p><p>Vietnamese Government.  They reportedly claimed that Vietnam </p><p>"forbids" Protestantism.  In another village in the same </p><p>commune, a "working delegation" also arrived on October 6 </p><p>and broke up a prayer meeting.  Another delegation came on </p><p>October 13 and tried -- unsuccessfully -- to "force" people </p><p>to sign statements renouncing Protestantism.  In yet another </p><p>village in this commune, officials from an "office to </p><p>prohibit faith" arrived on October 13, 2002 to forbid </p><p>communal prayer, and have come regularly on weekends since </p><p>then to make sure no one was praying.  They reportedly </p><p>threatened that those whose houses are used for communal </p><p>prayer might be arrested or kept under house arrest. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  Protestants in Dien Quan commune of Bao Yen </p><p>district wrote that "party and government cadres" had </p><p>claimed that anyone who doesn\'t renounce their faith "must </p><p>leave Vietnam" and had claimed that Protestantism was from </p><p>the U.S. and so people who refuse to renounce should go to </p><p>live there.  Officials came on at least two occasions in May </p><p>2002 to urge people to renounce their faith, but residents </p><p>refused.  Residents in a different village in the same </p><p>commune wrote that some people were pressured in detention </p><p>to sign renunciations but nonetheless maintain their faith. </p><p>Officials told them that not only were Protestants </p><p>"following America" but were also "reactionaries." </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  Another letter from Son Thuy commune in Van Ban </p><p>district reported unsuccessful efforts by local authorities </p><p>in November 2002 to forced people to sign renunciations, to </p><p>stop communal prayers, and to detain certain believers.  In </p><p>a different village in this commune, officials from the </p><p>"delegation to prohibit faith" tried on October 28 and </p><p>November 1 to get people to sign renunciations of faith, but </p><p>without success. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  Protestant Hmongs in Bao Nhai commune of Bac Ha </p><p>district reported that authorities had organized meetings </p><p>"many times" to stress that Protestantism is an "illegal </p><p>religion" that "follows America" and sometimes order </p><p>believers to report to the police chief.  They noted that </p><p>they refuse to go. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  Comment:  These reports make clear that at least </p><p>some local authorities in ethnic minority areas are </p><p>attempting -- usually without great success -- to suppress </p><p>the spread of Protestantism, and often incorrectly asserting </p><p>that this faith is illegal in Vietnam.  Especially worrisome </p><p>are the allegations of formal committees or offices set up </p><p>for such a campaign, at least in Lao Cai province.  As noted </p><p>in reftel, however, other Vietnamese Protestant leaders have </p><p>denied that there is any widespread campaign to force </p><p>renunciation of the Protestant faith.  It is also striking </p><p>that these letter writers usually indicate that they refused </p><p>blandishments -- in some cases, cash offers -- and threats </p><p>to induce them to renounce their faith.  Virtually all the </p><p>letter writers also noted that they only became Protestants </p><p>in 1989 or 1990, which underscores the perception on the </p><p>part of many Vietnamese officials that Protestantism is </p><p>somehow "non-Vietnamese."  The frequent references to </p><p>"following America" reflect the unfortunate belief by local </p><p>officials that attempts by US-based evangelical individuals </p><p>or groups to convert ethnic minorities are somehow part of a </p><p>US "plot" against Vietnam.  While Embassy does not have any </p><p>firm evidence of a systematic campaign against Protestants, </p><p>even in ethnic areas, these reports are disturbing.  Embassy </p><p>will continue to raise this issue with local, provincial, </p><p>and national officials and urge greater respect for freedom </p><p>of religion throughout Vietnam and among all faiths. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p></p></div>
