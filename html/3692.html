<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 005196 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>WHITE HOUSE FOR TUCKER ASKEU </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: O9/O9/2O12 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAL, IZ, XF, IS, JO, MEPP </p><p>SUBJECT: GOJ PUSHES BACK AT POPULAR DISSATISFACTION </p><p>ON IRAQ AND DOMESTIC ISSUES </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. AMMAN 4719 B. AMMAN 5131 C. STATE 1693O4 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: CDA Gregory L. Berry for reasons 1.5 </p><p>(B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (S) In recent weeks, the GOJ--through the King\'s </p><p>public address on August 15 (see Ref A), the Prime </p><p>Minister\'s speech to the Jordan press association on </p><p>September 2, and Royal Court Chief Fayez Tarawneh\'s </p><p>September 2 address to the Amman World Affairs Council </p><p>(see Ref B)--has respondcd more aggressively to public </p><p>criticism of the GOJ\'s stance on Iraq, the MEPP, and </p><p>other domestic issues, including its decision to </p><p>postpone elections.  In doing so, the King, PM, and </p><p>other GOJ officials have put forth the idea of "Jordan </p><p>First", underscoring that Jordanian interests are its </p><p>primary concern and that GOJ policy on the issues, </p><p>particularly Iraq, will reflect this.  By taking these </p><p>issues to the public, the GOJ is also beginning to </p><p>address popular frustration with an uneven record of </p><p>government communication on core issues.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>IRAQ: PREPARING THE PUBLIC </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) In contrast to the GOJ\'s sometimes misleading </p><p>public statements on Iraq in July, the King in his </p><p>August 15 speech and PM in his September 2 interview </p><p>placed the responsibility for resolving the current </p><p>crisis on the Iraqi government.  PM Abul Ragheb </p><p>emphasized that the GOJ will maintain a "balanced </p><p>relationship between Iraq and the U.S." and </p><p>underscored that both were "strategic partners of </p><p>Jordan."  By placing the burden of responsibility on </p><p>Saddam Hussein and emphasizing the strategic nature of </p><p>its relationship with the U.S., the GOJ appears to be </p><p>signaling to Jordanians that it will not jeopardize </p><p>its relationship with the U.S. in the event of a </p><p>conflict with Iraq.  However, recent discussions with </p><p>embassy contacts indicate the government\'s message so </p><p>far has had only a limited impact on the public. </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) Street opinion in Jordan, while harboring no </p><p>fondness for Saddam Hussein, remains critical of </p><p>perceived U.S. efforts to impose its will on the </p><p>region.  Public frustration over Iraq is one facet of </p><p>the popular consensus that the Arab world has no </p><p>influence on U.S. actions in the region.  Recent high- </p><p>level U.S. public diplomacy efforts on Iraq have not </p><p>shaken the view of many here that the U.S. will use </p><p>the U.N. as nothing more than a facade, and that </p><p>consultations will be limited.  As for the U.S. case </p><p>against Iraq, Jordanians persist in dismissing or </p><p>downplaying the possibility that Iraq may be harboring </p><p>CBW or WMD, despite Iraq\'s sordid and well-documented </p><p>history of WMD use. </p><p> </p><p>4. (S) Politically sophisticated contacts worry about </p><p>the economic and political ramifications for Jordan of </p><p>any prolonged offensive against Iraq.  Most caution </p><p>that public opinion will run heavily against the U.S., </p><p>but those connected to the government believe the </p><p>security services will be able to handle popular </p><p>discontent on the streets, albeit with stretched </p><p>resources.  To curb the "street", these contacts urge </p><p>the U.S. to make sure that any move against Saddam is </p><p>quick: "do not let the situation linger."  The </p><p>reaction of the Iraqi people to any action will likely </p><p>affect public opinion here.  If the Iraqi people were </p><p>to welcome U.S. troops as liberators, "it will diffuse </p><p>tensions." </p><p> </p><p>5. (S) The potential for U.S. military action against </p><p>Iraq is inevitably linked to the Palestinian issue in </p><p>the minds of Jordanians.  Criticism of U.S. policy on </p><p>Iraq is often tied to the U.S.\'s "one-sided" approach </p><p>to the MEPP and the perceived reluctance to enforce a </p><p>"just" solution on the Palestinian issue.  There is </p><p>widespread speculation that Israel will use any action </p><p>against Iraq to transfer Palestinians from the West </p><p>Bank to Jordan while the International Community is </p><p>focused elsewhere. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>DOMESTICALLY, NO APOLOGIES POR POSTPONING ELECTIONS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>6. (C) While the GOJ\'s evolving public policy on Iraq </p><p>has yet to have much impact, the King\'s postponement </p><p>of elections--as announced in his August 15 speech-- </p><p>continues to generate broad criticism.  The PM </p><p>addressed these critics in his September 2 remarks by </p><p>warning that if elections were held now, they could </p><p>"fall under external influence."  He defended the </p><p>quick tempo of temporary laws that have been passed </p><p>since the Parliament was dissolved last June, citing </p><p>their necessity for the "country\'s development."  He </p><p>also offered unusually strong criticism of the </p><p>political role that professional associations have </p><p>assumed and encouraged the associations to stick to </p><p>addressing the concerns of their professions, not </p><p>politics.  The PM also confronted criticism that the </p><p>government is outlawing demonstrations, "We did not </p><p>ban rallies and marches, but rather regulated them." </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) The message on elections is a hard sell to both </p><p>sophisticated political observers and the street. </p><p>Most contacts balk at the government\'s defense that </p><p>regional instability is a reason to delay.  "The </p><p>situation is more unstable now than when the </p><p>government first delayed elections...and it is only </p><p>growing worse!"  One Parliamentarian detailed, </p><p>district by district, how the Islamists could only </p><p>gain 20-25 seats under the current electoral system-- </p><p>hardly a threat to the government.  (The government </p><p>response in private is that a number of "swing" </p><p>parliamentarians would ally themselves with the avowed </p><p>Islamists on key issues including Iraq, creating </p><p>management problems with the GOJ.  Many contacts argue </p><p>that people need some forum for venting their growing </p><p>frustrations--protesting in Parliament is better than </p><p>protesting in the street.  Even some supporters of the </p><p>government argue that a sitting Parliament with a </p><p>strong opposition voice would strengthen the King\'s </p><p>hand, both domestically and internationally. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>SOMEONE NEEDS TO TALK TO THE PEOPLE </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) The government\'s reluctance to defend it\'s </p><p>policies directly with the people--the King\'s mid- </p><p>August public address is only the second time he has </p><p>spoken to the nation on camera since the beginning of </p><p>the Intifada--has been a long-standing theme with our </p><p>contacts.  One Circassian contact opined in July that </p><p>Jordan needs either a strong government with a Prime </p><p>Minister who can communicate with the people, or a </p><p>strong King with a natural feel for Jordanian </p><p>constituencies, but right now "we have neither-" </p><p>While it remains to be seen if the government\'s recent </p><p>attempts at public diplomacy will affect public </p><p>opinion, the government has at least recognized the </p><p>need to defend its often unpopular policy decisions. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) The GOJ\'s recent efforts to directly address </p><p>the people is a welcome step.  While many Jordanians </p><p>may not accept the government\'s reasoning, there is a </p><p>pressing need to prepare the populace for potential </p><p>disruptions in coming months.  The issue of Iraq will </p><p>be particularly divisive here, as the public </p><p>imagination will be focused on the plight of the Iraqi </p><p>people, not their leader.  We can expect zigs and zags </p><p>in the GOJ\'s language on Iraq as circumstances </p><p>dictate, but the government seems to have settled on a </p><p>broad outline for its public audience. </p><p>BERRY </p><p></p></div>
