THIS CABLE TRANSMITS AN INR MEMO OF JUNE 1 ON </p><p> </p><p>"POLITICAL ISLAM IN BLACK AFRICA."  THE MEMO IS A </p><p>SUMMARY OF VIEWS EXPRESSED BY ACADEMICS AT A MAY 7 </p><p>CONFERENCE SPONSORED BY INR AND, AS SUCH\' DOES NOT </p><p>REPRESENT THE VIEWS OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT.  YOUR </p><p>COMMENTS ARE WELCOMED. </p><p> </p><p>BEGIN SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>2.  AN INR CONFERENCE ON POLITICAL ISLAM IN BLACK AFRICA </p><p>HELD ON MAY 7 CONCLUDED THAT: </p><p> </p><p>--POLITICAL ISLAM THROUGHOUT THE MUSLIM WORLD IS NOT A </p><p>MONOLITHIC FUNDAMENTALIST MOVEMENT\' BUT A VARIED </p><p>PHENOMENON, RANGING FROM REVOLUTIONARIES SUCH AS </p><p>LEBANON\'S HIZBALLAH TO REFORMERS IN JORDAN AND KUWAIT. </p><p> </p><p>--ISLAMISTS ARE ROOTED IN BOTH THE PAST AND THE </p><p>PRESENT.  THEY HAVE MODERN EDUCATIONS (TURABI. THE </p><p>LEADER OF THE NATIONAL ISLAMIC FRONT IN SUDAN, IS </p><p>TRILINGUAL) AND EFFICIENT ORGANIZATIONS (INCLUDING FAXES </p><p>AND CASSETTES). </p><p> </p><p>--MILITANT BRANDS OF POLITICAL ISLAM DO NOT FOSE AN </p><p>IMMINENT THREAT TO BLACK AFRICA.  THE MAJORITY OF </p><p>AFRICAN MUSLIMS BELONG TO MAINSTREAM MUSLIM </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS AND SUPPORT DEMOCRATIZATION AS A MEANS OF </p><p>REFORMING CORRUPT GOVERNMENTS AND STAGNANT ECONOMIES. </p><p>IF DEMOCRATIZATION FAILS, POLITICAL ISLAM COULD POSE A </p><p>LONGER-TERM CHALLENGE TO STATES WITH LARGE MUSLIM </p><p>POPULATIONS SUCH AS NIGERIA. </p><p></p><p>--THE SUDANESE REGIME HAS PLANS FOR PROPAGATING </p><p>POLITICAL ISLAM BUT LACKS THE RESOURCES TO DO THIS. </p><p>KHARTOUM IS NOT A THREAT TO NEIGHBORING UGANDA OR KENYA, </p><p>WHERE MUSLIMS ARE SMALL INEFFECTIVE MINORITIES.  A </p><p>SUDANESE INVASION OF UGANDA, OR A SUDANESE LINK-UP WITH </p><p>AN UGANDAN MUSLIM "FIFTH COLUMN" TO OVERTHROW MUSEVENI. </p><p>ARE UNLIKELY. </p><p></p><p>--IRAN DOES NOT GIVE A HIGH PRIORITY TO BLACK AFRICA, </p><p>AND ITS ATTEMPT TO GAIN INFLUENCE HAS HAD ONLY LIMITED </p><p>SUCCESS.  ITS LONG RANGE OBJECTIVES ARE UNCLEAR. </p><p>TEHRAN\'S GREATEST ATTRACTION IS ITS DEFIANCE OF THE WEST. </p><p></p><p>--THE REAL IMPACT OF POLITICAL ISLAM ON THE INTERESTS OF </p><p>THE U.S. AND THE WEST LIES IN THE SPREAD OF ISLAMIC </p><p>CULTURE.  AS WESTERN CULTURAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS, WHICH </p><p></p><p>ONCE HAD A CRITICAL IMPACT ON AFRICAN YOUTH, ARE </p><p>REDUCED, ISLAMIC STATES ARE FILLING THE GAP. </p><p></p><p>BEGIN TEXT </p><p></p><p>3.  INR\'S MAY 7 CONFERENCE ON POLITICAL ISLAM IN BLACK </p><p>AFRICA BROUGHT TOGETHER THE FOLLOWING ACADEMIC </p><p>SPECIALISTS:  JOHN ESPOSITO, COLLEGE OF THE HOLY CROSS; </p><p>JOHN VOLL, UNIVERSITY OF NEW HAMPSHIRE; NELSON KASFIR, </p><p>DARTMOUTH COLLEGE; PRISCILLA STARRATT, NEW ENGLAND </p><p>COLLEGE; AND JOHN HUNWICK, NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY. </p><p></p><p>4.  THE CHALLENGE OF POLITICAL ISLAM:  ESPOSITO </p><p>PRESENTED A POLICY FRAMEWORK FOR CONSIDERING POLITICAL </p><p>ISLAM IN BLACK AFRICA.  THE WEST TENDS TO "DEMONIZE" </p><p>POLITICAL ISLAM, PORTRAYING IT AS A MONOLITHIC </p><p>FUNDAMENTALIST THREAT TO WESTERN VALUES.  THE REALITY IS </p><p>A WIDE SPECTRUM OF MOVEMENTS THAT STRETCHES FROM AFRICA </p><p>TO SOUTHEAST ASIA AND INCLUDES BOTH REVOLUTIONARIES AND </p><p>REFORMERS.  REFORMERS CONSTITUTE THE MAJORITY AND HAVE </p><p>PARTICIPATED IN THE POLITICAL MAINSTREAM IN SUCH STATES </p><p>AS JORDAN AND KUWAIT. </p><p></p><p>5.  WHAT MAKES ISLAMISTS APPEAR TO BE A THREAT IN </p><p>WESTERN EYES IS THEIR MODERNITY.  ALTHOUGH THEY ROOT </p><p>THEIR PRESENT AND FUTURE GOALS IN PAST VALUES, THEY HAVE </p><p>MODERN EDUCATIONS, ARE ORGANIZED, AND OFTEN BECOME THE </p><p>LEADING OPPOSITION MOVEMENTS IN AUTHORITARIAN STATES. </p><p>THE MAJORITY OF MUSLIMS  RELIGIOUS OR SECULAR, WANT </p><p>DEMOCRACY.  THEY WISH TO LEGITIMIZE DEMOCRACY BY </p><p>REJUVENATING THE ISLAMIC CONCEPTS OF CONSULTATION AND </p><p>CONSENSUS.  SIMILARLY, JEWS AND CHRISTIANS HAD TO </p><p>LEGITIMIZE DEMOCRACY, WHICH WAS ANTITHETICAL TO THEIR </p><p>TRADITIONAL BELIEFS (THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH DID NOT </p><p>ACCEPT POLITICAL PLURALISM UNTIL VATICAN II). </p><p></p><p>6.  ATTEMPTS TO REPRESS ISLAMIST MOVEMENTS, SUCH AS </p><p>NASSER\'S "DECAPITATION" OF THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD, WILL </p><p>STRENGTHEN AND RADICALIZE THEM.  ALTERNATIVELY, IF </p><p>POLITICAL SYSTEMS BECOME MORE COMPETITIVE, SOME </p><p>ISLAMISTS MIGHT SELF-DESTRUCT, BUT OTHERS MIGHT BECOME </p><p>MORE PRAGMATIC AND RESPOND TO BROADER CONSTITUENCIES, </p><p>FOCUSING ON NATIONAL INTERESTS AND HOW TO DEAL WITH THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. </p><p></p><p>7.  FORMER AF ASSISTANT SECRETARY HERMAN COHEN NOTED THE </p><p>U.S. PERCEPTION THAT POLITICAL ISLAM MEANS NASTY PEOPLE </p><p>USING ISLAM TO UNDERMINE U.S. INTERESTS.  A REFERENCE </p><p>WAS MADE TO CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER\'S RECENT ARTICLE </p><p>LABELING POLITICAL ISLAM THE "NEW COMINTERN."  ESPOSITO </p><p>AND OTHER ACADEMICS ARGUED THAT THE CAPABILITIES OF THE </p><p>SUDANESE AND IRANIAN REGIMES HAVE BEEN OVERESTIMATED. </p><p></p><p>8.  POLITICAL ISLAM IN SUDAN:  JOHN VOLL EMPHASIZED THAT </p><p>THE NIF REGIME IN SUDAN IS NOT AN ABERRATION--A MOVEMENT </p><p>PUT IN POWER BY ISLAMIST CONSPIRATORS IN 1989 OR SPAWNED </p><p>BY THE IRANIAN REVOLUTION--BUT THE LOGICAL OUTCOME OF </p><p>LONG-TERM TRENDS.  WHAT WOULD BE UNNATURAL WOULD BE A </p><p>SUDANESE REGIME WHICH WAS NON-RELIGIOUS OR ANTI-MUSLIM, </p><p>AND WHICH WAS UNINVOLVED IN THE AFFAIRS OF NEIGHBORING </p><p>STATES.  HE SUPPORTED THESE CONCLUSIONS, AS FOLLOWS. </p><p></p><p>--SUDAN HAS HAD A SERIES OF ISLAMIST GOVERNMENTS SINCE </p><p>THE EARLY 19TH CENTURY, INCLUDING THE FAMOUS MAHDIYYA </p><p>(1884-1898).  EVEN THE BRITISH CONDOMINIUM (1899-1956) </p><p>IDENTIFIED ITSELF AS A FRIEND OF ISLAM.  IN THE </p><p>POST-1956 INDEPENDENCE PERIOD, NO SUDANESE ELECTED </p><p>GOVERNMENT HAS DISASSOCIATED THE STATE FROM ISLAMIST </p><p>TRADITIONS.  THE NIF GOVERNMENT IS NOT THE FIRST TO TRY </p><p>TO UNIFY THE COUNTRY ON AN ISLAMIC BASIS.  THE NIF IS </p><p>ONLY ONE STRAND OF POLITICAL ISLAM IN SUDAN, WHICH </p><p>INCLUDES TRADITIONAL POLITICAL PARTIES SUCH AS THE UMMA. </p><p></p><p>--SUDAN IS PART OF "SUDANIC AFRICA," A BELT OF CULTURAL </p><p>INTERACTION EXTENDING FROM WEST AFRICA TO THE GULF OF </p><p>ARABIA.  AFRICANS MAKING THE PILGRIMAGE TO MECCA ARE IN </p><p>MOTION ACROSS THE BELT, AND MANY SETTLE TEMPORARILY IN </p><p>SUDAN.  CONSEQUENTLY, SUDANESE THINK MORE IN TERMS OF AN </p><p>EAST/WEST AXIS THAN A NORTH/SOUTH AXIS.  SUDANESE </p><p>INTEREST IN EGYPT HAS BEEN OVERSTATED; EGYPTIAN PEASANTS </p><p>ARE NO MORE INTERESTED IN THE NIF THAN THEY WERE IN THE </p><p>MAHDI.  IN CONTRAST, THE POROUS SUDAN-CHAD BORDER </p><p>FACILITATED QADHAFI\'S INTERVENTION IN CHADIAN POLITICS </p><p>AND ENABLED DEBY TO OVERTHROW THE PREVIOUS CHADIAN </p><p>PRESIDENT.  SUDAN\'S EQUALLY POROUS EASTERN BORDER </p><p>FACILITATES INTERACTION WITH ERITREA. </p><p></p><p>--IN THE DISCUSSION PERIOD, DR. ROBERT JENKINS OF THE </p><p>HOUSE FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE QUOTED NIF OFFICIALS AS </p><p>SAYING THAT "IF NECESSARY TO PROTECT OUR BROTHERS, WE </p><p>WILL USE FORCE."  ACCORDING TO VOLL, THE NIF IS NOT </p><p>SAYING THAT IT WILL DISPATCH THE SUDANESE ARMY TO </p><p>CONQUER AFRICA, BUT IS SAYING WHAT THE MUJAHADEEN, WHO </p><p>WENT AS INDIVIDUALS TO FIGHT IN AFGHANISTAN, SAID--THAT </p><p>EACH MUSLIM HAS THE OBLIGATION TO HELP OPPRESSED MUSLIMS </p><p>ELSEWHERE. </p><p></p><p>9.  THE NIF\'S IMPACT IN EAST AFRICA:  NELSON KASFIR </p><p>ARGUED THAT THE NIF IS NOT A THREAT TO NEIGHBORING </p><p>UGANDA AND KENYA, BUT COULD CAUSE SOME TROUBLE IN </p><p>TANZANIA.  THE SUDANESE REGIME IS EXTREMELY WEAK, BOTH </p><p>POLITICALLY AND ECONOMICALLY.  TURABI DOES NOT HAVE THE </p><p>SUPPORT THAT HE DID A DECADE AGO.  THE NIF STAGED ITS </p><p>1989 COUP TO KEEP FROM BEING FROZEN OUT OF POWER.  THE </p><p>NIF ALSO HAS ITS HANDS FULL IN THE SOUTHERN SUDAN. </p><p>DESPITE NIF MILITARY GAINS AND SOUTHERN INSURGENT </p><p>SPLITS, THE REGIME CANNOT BREAK THE INSURGENTS\' HOLD ON </p><p>THE SOUTHERN COUNTRYSIDE. </p><p></p><p>10.  THE SUDANESE REGIME WILL CONTINUE TO BOMB THE </p><p>UGANDAN BORDER AREAS OCCASIONALLY TO COUNTER MUSEVENI\'S </p><p>AID TO SOUTHERN INSURGENTS, BUT AN INVASION IS </p><p>UNLIKELY.  IT IS ALSO UNLIKELY THAT THE NIF COULD LINK </p><p>UP WITH A "FIFTH COLUMN" OF UGANDAN MUSLIMS.  MUSEVENI </p><p>IS ON REASONABLY GOOD TERMS WITH MUSLIMS IN NORTHWESTERN </p><p>UGANDA, AND MANY OF THE UGANDANS HE IS AT ODDS WITH IN </p><p>THE NORTH AND NORTHEAST ARE CHRISTIANS.  FURTHER, </p><p>UGANDAN MUSLIMS ARE A SMALL. DIVIDED, SCORNED MINORITY </p><p>(ESTIMATED AT 10 PERCENT OF THE POPULATION) WITH LITTLE </p><p>POLITICAL CLOUT.  MOST UGANDAN MUSLIMS ARE CONCERNED </p><p>WITH THEIR LOCAL INTERESTS AND THE OPPORTUNITIES OFFERED </p><p>BY MUSEVENI\'S DEMOCRATIZATION PLANS. </p><p></p><p>11.  KENYAN MUSLIMS ALSO ARE A SMALL, DIVIDED MINORITY </p><p>(ESTIMATED AT FIVE TO SIX PERCENT OF THE POPULATION), </p><p>OVERSHADOWED BY A LARGELY CHRISTIAN POLITICAL ELITE. </p><p>MUSLIMS WHO LIVE ON THE COAST HAVE FELT ESPECIALLY </p><p>MARGINALIZED SINCE INDEPENDENCE.  THEY FORMED A MUSLIM </p><p>PARTY IN 1992 TO COMPETE IN THE NATIONAL LEGISLATIVE </p><p>ELECTIONS, WINNING TWO SEATS IN AN ALLIANCE WITH A MAJOR </p><p>OPPOSITION PARTY.  THE MUSLIM PARTY APPEARS TO BE A </p><p>COALITION OF PEOPLE WITH LOCAL GRIEVANCES BUT NO WEDGE </p><p>FOR INTRODUCING RELIGION INTO THE POLITICAL ARENA. </p><p></p><p>12.  TANZANIA, WITH A MUCH LARGER MUSLIM POPULATION </p><p>(ESTIMATED AT 30-40 PERCENT OF THE POPULATION), MAY BE </p><p>MORE RECEPTIVE TO SUDANESE PROSELYTIZING.  IN APRIL 1993 </p><p>THREE SUDANESE TEACHERS WERE DEPORTED FOR INCITING </p><p>MUSLIMS AGAINST NON-MUSLIMS.  ALTHOUGH AN AFRICAN CANNOT </p><p>GET AHEAD IN UGANDA NOR KENYA BY BECOMING A MUSLIM, IT </p><p>COULD BE ADVANTAGEOUS IN TANZANIA. </p><p></p><p>13.  VOLL SAID THAT AN IRANIAN-ORIENTED BRAND OF </p><p>POLITICAL ISLAM COULD APPEAL TO SMALL  SEPARATE MUSLIM </p><p>MINORITIES IN STATES SUCH AS SOUTH AFRICA AS A MEANS OF </p><p>TRANSCENDING THEIR DIVISIONS.  COUNTERING THE APPEAL IN </p><p>SOUTH AFRICA IS THE DESIRE OF MUSLIMS, MALAY OR ASIAN, </p><p>TO PARTICIPATE IN THE POST-APARTHEID DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM </p><p>NOW BEING NEGOTIATED. </p><p> </p><p>14.  POLITICAL ISLAM IN WEST AFRICA:  PRISCILLA STARRATT </p><p>DISCUSSED POLITICAL ISLAM IN WEST AFRICAN STATES WHICH </p><p>HAVE MAJORITY MUSLIM POPULATIONS.  SHE ATTRIBUTED ITS </p><p>GROWING APPEAL TO ECONOMIC DECLINE, INCREASING </p><p>INEQUALITIES, AND CORRUPTION.  MANY AFRICAN MUSLIMS </p><p>BELIEVE THAT BOTH WESTERN CAPITALISM AND MARXISM\' AS </p><p>WELL AS THE NATION-STATE, HAVE FAILED THEM AND THEY ARE </p><p>LOOKING FOR SOLUTIONS WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THEIR OWN </p><p>CULTURE.  ISLAMIC GOVERNMENTS ARE VIEWED AS BEING JUST. </p><p>SOME MUSLIMS SEE CHRISTIANITY AS A COLONIAL LEGACY AND </p><p>BELIEVE THAT THE REESTABLISHMENT OF AN ISLAMIC STATE IN </p><p>THE SUDANIC BELT, WHERE ISLAMIC EMPIRES FLOURISHED </p><p>DURING THE 18TH AND 19TH CENTURIES, WOULD BE THE FINAL </p><p>STAGE OF DECOLONIZATION. </p><p></p><p>15.  OVERALL, WEST AFRICAN MUSLIMS ARE DIVIDED ABOUT THE </p><p>MERITS OF POLITICAL ISLAM, AND THERE ARE NO ACTIVE </p><p>ISLAMIC PARTIES IN THE REGION.  WEST AFRICANS, IN </p><p>GENERAL, ARE PREOCCUPIED WITH CONSTRUCTING NEW </p><p>DEMOCRATIC POLITICAL SYSTEMS WHICH OFFER HOPE FOR </p><p>REFORM.  IF DEMOCRATIZATION FAILS. POLITICAL ISLAM COULD </p><p>BECOME MORE IMPORTANT, ESPECIALLY IN THE SUDANIC BELT. </p><p></p><p>16.  STARRATT, WHO HAD LIVED FOR 15 YEARS IN NORTHERN </p><p>NIGERIA, WAS CONCERNED ABOUT GROWING MUSLIM-CHRISTIAN </p><p>TENSIONS IN THE NORTH AND IN NIGERIA AS A WHOLE.  THESE </p><p>TENSIONS CENTER ON SUCH ISSUES AS SHARI\'A AND NIGERIA.S </p><p>ATTEMPT TO JOIN THE ORGANIZATION OF ISLAMIC CONFERENCE. </p><p>SHE WARNED THAT IF NIGERIANS FAIL TO REFORM THEIR </p><p>CORRUPT GOVERNMENT AND REVIVE THEIR STAGNANT ECONOMY, </p><p>ISLAMISTS COULD COME TO POWER WITHIN THE NEXT FEW </p><p>YEARS.  THIS ASSESSMENT MET WITH SKEPTICISM FROM MOST </p><p>PARTICIPANTS. </p><p></p><p>17.  BLACK AFRICA AND THE WIDER ISLAMIC WORLD:  JOHN </p><p>HUNWICK NOTED THAT PAN-ISLAMIC NETWORKS AND </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS ARE AS OLD AS ISLAM ITSELF.  THE </p><p>PILGRIMAGE TO MECCA WAS THE PRECURSOR OF THE FAX MACHINE </p><p>AND CASSETTE TAPE.  AFRICAN MUSLIMS TODAY PUBLISH THEIR </p><p>BOOKS IN ENGLISH, FRENCH, AND ARABIC, STUDY IN EGYPT, </p><p>SAUDI ARABIA, IRAN, MOROCCO AND LIBYA  AND ATTEND </p><p>INTERNATIONAL ISLAMIC CONFERENCES.  HUNWICH SAID THE </p><p>ORGANIZATION OF THE ISLAMIC CONFERENCE, WHICH INCLUDES </p><p>18 AFRICAN MEMBERS OUT OF 46, IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE OF </p><p>THE PAN-ISLAMIC NETWORKS. </p><p></p><p>18.  COMPETITION AMONG MIDDLE EASTERN STATES IN BLACK </p><p>AFRICA WAS EXAMINED BY HUNWICK AND OTHER PARTICIPANTS: </p><p></p><p>--LIBYA:  QADHAFI HAS USED A VARIETY OF MECHANISMS TO </p><p>GAIN INFLUENCE.  IN STATES WITH MUSLIM MINORITIES. HE </p><p>HAS SOUGHT TO SUPPORT THOSE MINORITIES THROUGH THE </p><p>OPENING OF ISLAMIC CULTURAL CENTERS AND THE DISPACH OF </p><p>MUSLIM MISSIONARIES AND ARABIC TEACHERS.  IN STATES WITH </p><p>SOCIALIST-ORIENTED REGIMES, SUCH AS BURKINA FASO, THE </p><p>EMPHASIS HAS BEEN ON THE IDEOLOGY OF THE "GREEN BOOK." </p><p>IN THE MUSLIM MAJORITY STATES OF THE SUDANIC BELT. HE </p><p>HAS ALTERNATIVELY SUPPORTED AND ATTACKED REGIMES, </p><p>INCLUDING THE SUDAN. </p><p></p><p>--IRAN:  IRANIAN OBJECTIVES IN BLACK AFRICA ARE UNCLEAR, </p><p>BUT THE ACADEMICS DID NOT BELIEVE THAT TEHRAN ASSIGNS A </p><p>HIGH PRIORITY TO THE REGION.  THE WEAKNESS OF THE </p><p>IRANIAN ECONOMY CURBS TEHRAN.S FOREIGN POLICY </p><p>AMBITIONS.  IRAN\'S PRIMARY INFLUENCE IN AFRICA IS </p><p>INTELLECTUAL AND CULTURAL, DRAWING ON THE MODEL OF AN </p><p>ISLAMIC REVOLUTION WHICH HAS STOOD UP TO THE WEST AND </p><p>SURVIVED. </p><p></p><p>--SAUDI ARABIA:  THE SAUDIS HAVE SUPPORTED RELIGIOUS </p><p>PROPAGANDA AND AID PROGRAMS, IN PART TO COUNTER THE </p><p>INFLUENCE OF IRAN AND OTHER STATES. </p><p></p><p>19.  MIDDLE EASTERN COUNTRIES HAVE POURED CONSIDERABLE </p><p>RESOURCES INTO AFRICA, FOR DEVELOPMENT, CULTURE, AND </p><p>EDUCATION.  THE ACADEMICS AGREED THAT THE SECOND </p><p>CATEGORY WILL BEAR THE MOST FRUIT IN THE LONG RUN.  VOLL </p><p>WARNED THAT THE REAL THREAT OF POLITICAL ISLAM TO THE </p><p>U.S. AND THE WEST IS CULTURAL.  AS WESTERN CULTURAL AID </p><p>PROGRAMS, WHICH ONCE HAD A CRITICAL IMPACT ON AFRICAN </p><p>YOUTH, ARE PARED BACK, ISLAMIC STATES ARE MOVING TO FILL </p><p>THE GAP. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>WHARTON </p><p></p></div>
