<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 KATHMANDU 001005 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/22/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, PTER, ASEC, PINR, NP, Government of Nepal (GON) </p><p>SUBJECT: PARLIAMENT DISSOLVED; ELECTIONS CALLED FOR </p><p>NOVEMBER; PM KICKED OUT OF PARTY </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. KATHMANDU 996 </p><p>     B. KATHMANDU 995 </p><p>     C. KATHMANDU 740 (EXDIS) </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Michael E. Malinowski, Reasons 1.5(b),(d) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary.  Nepal\'s King on May 22 announced the </p><p>dissolution of Parliament and called elections for November </p><p>13 after a faction of the ruling party refused to support </p><p>Prime Minister Deuba\'s attempt to extend the state of </p><p>emergency.  The ruling party then kicked out the PM May 23. </p><p>Three Ministers resigned May 23, and the PM will likely </p><p>appoint a new Cabinet.  Deuba\'s move was constitutional, </p><p>experts judged, but raises many questions including what </p><p>happens if circumstances prevent elections from being held </p><p>and whether the emergency can be extended.  After dissolution </p><p>Parliament\'s upper house takes on many of the roles of the </p><p>lower house, including deciding on the emergency, but Deuba </p><p>does not likely have the votes there to secure an extension. </p><p>Alternatively, the emergency could be extended by executive </p><p>fiat.  The army says recent developments will have no effect </p><p>on their operations.  Deuba has tried to make the best of a </p><p>bad situation, but will be under tremendous pressure to bring </p><p>about positive change in the coming months to justify his </p><p>actions.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Parliament Dissolved, Elections Slated, PM Excommunicated </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) On the recommendation of Prime Minister Sher Bahadur </p><p>Deuba\'s Cabinet, Nepal\'s King Gyanendra dissolved the lower </p><p>house of Parliament late on May 22 and set fresh elections </p><p>for November 13.  His announcement followed an inconclusive </p><p>and hastily convoked meeting of Nepali Congress Party (NCP) </p><p>Members of Parliament earlier in the evening.  The MPs </p><p>convened after a stormy meeting of the Party\'s Central </p><p>Working Committee (CWC) - dominated by supporters of Deuba\'s </p><p>political rival, NCP President and former PM Girija Prasad </p><p>("G.P.") Koirala - which decided not to support Deuba\'s </p><p>efforts to extend the state of emergency in effect since </p><p>November 26, 2001.  (Note:  According to PM Deuba, he acted </p><p>to preempt a no-confidence motion reportedly planned for the </p><p>afternoon of May 23 (Septel).  End Note.)  Another CWC </p><p>meeting held May 23 decided to strip Deuba of his NCP </p><p>membership. </p><p> </p><p>Three Ministers Resign; New Cabinet a Possibility </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Late in the day Post learned that three Ministers had </p><p>resigned:  Ram Sharan Mahat at the Finance Ministry; Amod </p><p>Prasad Upadhyaya at Education and Sports; and Rajendra Kharel </p><p>at Women, Children and Social Welfare.  Tirtha Man Shakya, a </p><p>lawyer and former Chief Secretary (Nepal\'s highest-ranking </p><p>civil servant), confirmed that after dissolving Parliament </p><p>the PM is free to dismiss his cabinet and appoint "anyone off </p><p>the street."  Speculation is rife in the capital about who </p><p>will be brought in to serve in an interim cabinet. </p><p> </p><p>Deuba\'s Gambit Constitutional </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) As related Ref C, Deuba was constitutionally within </p><p>his rights to dissolve Parliament and call for new elections. </p><p> The King, as constitutional monarch, was then compelled to </p><p>accede to the PM\'s request.  Under the current 1990 </p><p>constitution, a precedent was set when former Prime Minister </p><p>G.P. Koirala dissolved Parliament and called for new </p><p>elections in 1994 after members of his own party withdrew </p><p>their support on a key policy vote.  The Supreme Court upheld </p><p>Koirala\'s 1994 move, but subsequent attempts to dissolve </p><p>Parliament by a minority government PM in 1995 and a </p><p>coalition government PM in 1998 were blocked by the Court </p><p>because these PMs moved after no-confidence motions were </p><p>already underway.  In acting before a no-confidence motion </p><p>could be tabled, Deuba seems to have taken into account the </p><p>Court\'s inevitable scrutiny on this count. </p><p> </p><p>But Raises Thorny Constitutional Issues </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Even so, Deuba\'s actions raise a number of </p><p>complicated constitutional issues.  For example, Nepal\'s </p><p>constitution does not include a provision for what happens </p><p>when elections cannot be held within a specified period of </p><p>time, in this case six months, as may eventually be the case </p><p>given Nepal\'s widespread Maoist insurgency.  Although Deuba\'s </p><p>actions to date have been constitutional, questions remain </p><p>about what would happen if the November 13 elections do not </p><p>come off or are contested.  According to Tirtha Man Shakya, </p><p>simply setting a date was enough to fulfill the </p><p>constitutional requirement.  Whether or not elections are </p><p>actually held on that date is immaterial.  Shakya admitted, </p><p>however, that although he himself considered this view </p><p>legally sound, it was subject to review by the courts, who </p><p>may take a different view.  He added that Nepal\'s </p><p>constitution is oddly silent on the subject of what measures </p><p>would have to be taken in the wake of a failure to hold </p><p>Parliamentary elections.  Again, he said, this is a matter </p><p>for the courts to decide. </p><p> </p><p>How to Hold Elections? </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) How to hold elections within six months, as required </p><p>by the constitution, is the greatest challenge now facing </p><p>Nepal\'s democracy.  The army has declared itself ready to </p><p>guarantee the security of the elections, but under emergency </p><p>conditions this task would be problematic at best.  Shakya </p><p>suggested that the constitution provides one way out by </p><p>defining a quorum in Parliament as twenty-five percent of </p><p>members.  Thus a partial election could be held - in as few </p><p>as 52 of Nepal\'s 205 constituencies - that would serve to </p><p>constitute a new body. </p><p> </p><p>Upper House Takes Lower House Powers </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Some critics alleged that the emergency will lapse </p><p>because the bill to extend it has not yet been introduced </p><p>into the upper house, where it must "mature" for five days </p><p>before a vote can take place.  Legal experts demurred, </p><p>however, stating that under the constitution the upper house </p><p>takes up the powers of the lower house when the latter has </p><p>been dissolved.  Therefore, because the bill has already been </p><p>introduced and has matured in the lower chamber, the upper </p><p>house can go ahead and vote on it.  (Note:  Deuba\'s action </p><p>dissolved the lower house, the House of Representatives, but </p><p>the upper house - the National Assembly - remains in place. </p><p>The National Assembly has sixty members, including ten "of </p><p>high reputation" nominated by the King; 35 elected by the </p><p>lower house; and three each elected by local officials in </p><p>Nepal\'s five development regions.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>Emergency Unlikely to Pass Upper House </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Under the constitution, following the expiration of </p><p>the initial six-month period, the state of emergency can be </p><p>extended an additional six months by a two-thirds vote of </p><p>Parliament.  Since the lower house has been dissolved, it </p><p>falls to the upper house to vote on an extension.  As 23 of </p><p>the National Assembly\'s 59 sitting members belong to the main </p><p>opposition party, the CPN-UML, Deuba will be unable to extend </p><p>the state of emergency for the full six months without UML </p><p>support.  (Note:  Deuba told the Ambassador May 23 that he </p><p>does not believe that he has enough votes in the upper house </p><p>to get the motion approved (Septel).  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) However, by keeping the Assembly out of session, he </p><p>will be able to continue the emergency for an additional </p><p>three months by having the Cabinet ask the King to issue an </p><p>Ordinance to that effect.  Alternatively, should the state of </p><p>emergency lapse the PM could have the King declare a new </p><p>emergency, starting the clock over again.  Shakya judges that </p><p>in this way the government could declare successive </p><p>emergencies, with only a gap of a day - or even hours - </p><p>between them. </p><p> </p><p>General: No Impact on RNA Operations </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Chief of General Staff Lt. Gen. Pyar Jung Bahadur </p><p>Thapa said that dissolution of Parliament and possible </p><p>expiration of the state of emergency will have "no immediate </p><p>impact" on Royal Nepalese Army (RNA) operations.  General </p><p>Thapa did not want to speculate much beyond the near term, </p><p>however. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) Painted into a corner by the machinations of </p><p>political rivals, PM Deuba has tried to make the most of a </p><p>bad situation.  By calling new elections he bought time to </p><p>clean house and continue the prosecution of the campaign </p><p>against the Maoists, who of late seem to be feeling the heat. </p><p> By his actions he has shown himself conversant with twelve </p><p>years of constitutional legal precedent, and he shows every </p><p>indication of continuing to use the law to his own advantage. </p><p> Deuba may have six months to a year in which to justify his </p><p>actions and make his mark - to get his country back on an </p><p>even political and economic keel.  The pressure for him to </p><p>perform is now greater than ever, as his critics will take </p><p>every opportunity to drag him down. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
