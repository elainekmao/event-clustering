<p>UNCLAS OTTAWA 000713 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: AFIN, ABUD, AORC, USOAS </p><p>SUBJECT: CANADA WON\'T SUPPORT OAS QUOTA PAYMENT INCREASE </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 50110 </p><p> </p><p>Embassy delivered reftel talking points to Alison Benn, OAS </p><p>coordinator in the Inter-American Division of DFAIT\'s Latin </p><p>America and Caribbean Bureau, on March 4.  Benn told poloff </p><p>at that time that the question of increasing Canada\'s OAS </p><p>quota payment had not yet been discussed at DFAIT. In a </p><p>follow-up discussion March 14, Benn advised poloff that </p><p>Canada will not support an OAS quota payment increase at this </p><p>time. Benn said that Canada wants to see greater </p><p>accountability on OAS\'s part. She indicated that before </p><p>Canada would agree a quota increase is necessary, it would </p><p>have to do further research to identify what OAS costs are </p><p>increasing, and why they are increasing. (Note: in an </p><p>off-the-record comment, Benn (please protect) said she found </p><p>it ironic that Brazil and the U.S. were leading this effort, </p><p>as they had been in arrears on their OAS assessments. End </p><p>note.) </p><p> </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
