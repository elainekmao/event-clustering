<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 003408 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/19/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, KPAL, IS, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDANIAN PALESTINIANS NOTCH UP CRITICISM OF ARAFAT </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMBASSADOR EDWARD W. GNEHM FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) While Jordanian Palestinians have long grumbled about </p><p>Arafat, two prominent Jordanian Palestinian leaders recently </p><p>expressed to us a new level of criticism of the PA President. </p><p> Some Palestinian Jordanians are even calling into question </p><p>Arafat\'s true nationality in another round of anti-Arafat </p><p>conspiracy theories.  Despite the intensified criticism from </p><p>the more critical thinkers here, Arafat remains the </p><p>emotion-evoking symbol of the Palestinian people for the </p><p>majority of Palestinian Jordanians.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>WHO IS ARAFAT? </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Poloff met separately with former Prime Minister Taher </p><p>al-Masri and former Royal Court Advisor Adnan Abu Odeh on </p><p>June 19, prominent Jordanians of Palestinian origin.  Both </p><p>offered harsh criticism of Arafat.  Taher al-Masri, whose </p><p>brother Maher is a member of Arafat\'s cabinet, complained </p><p>that Arafat is a major obstacle to reform, which the PA </p><p>desperately needs.  At a World Affairs Council the same </p><p>night, he told the elite audience that Palestinians should </p><p>not reject out of hand U.S. pressure to reform the PA and </p><p>reminded the audience that it was Arafat who refused to sign </p><p>the Judiciary and Basic Law.  Note: Jordanian press </p><p>editorials have also been calling for PA reform, "even though </p><p>it is being directed by the U.S."  Al-Masri also confided to </p><p>Poloff that "if something happens to Arafat, it would not be </p><p>a bad thing" and prefaced his comments by saying he would not </p><p>have said that a few months back. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Al-Masri commented on the new PNA cabinet by saying it </p><p>was "an okay first step, as long as it isn\'t isolated."  He </p><p>also reported that at least 5-6 of those around </p><p>Arafat--including Abu Mazen, Hikmat Zeid, and Nabil Amr--were </p><p>really tough on him in a recent meeting on reform, and Hikmat </p><p>Zeid--who is not part of Arafat\'s new Cabinet--walked out of </p><p>the room after calling Arafat an "S.O.B.".  According to </p><p>al-Masri, the new PA Minister of Interior and former Special </p><p>Representative of the PLO Commission in Jordan, Abdel Razzak </p><p>al-Yahya, was a moderate who had built a million dollar </p><p>mansion in Amman\'s ritzy Abdoun area while working for </p><p>Arafat. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Abu Odeh, while never fond of Arafat, bitterly </p><p>complained to Poloff about continued corruption among Arafat </p><p>and his cronies and derided Arafat for his limited vocabulary </p><p>and his inability to think conceptually.  Abu Odeh cited </p><p>several examples of the continued corruption and also </p><p>criticized Arafat\'s campaign to damage the reputation of </p><p>Mustapha Bourgouti, who was being targeted because of his </p><p>increased popularity and his clean reputation.  In response </p><p>to a question about what the U.S. could do to push PA reform, </p><p>Abu Odeh said the U.S. should open an investigation into PA </p><p>corruption and cite several specific examples.  By doing so, </p><p>the U.S. could improve its own reputation at the grass roots </p><p>level, but could avoid blaming Arafat directly.  While Abu </p><p>Odeh applauded some of the new PA Cabinet members, he derided </p><p>the choice of Yahya as Interior Minister.  Like al-Masri, he </p><p>pointed to the million dollar villa in Abdoun that he said </p><p>Arafat built for Yahya and said that Arafat was calling on </p><p>Yahya to return the favor. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Interestingly, both Al-Masri and Abu Odeh told Poloff </p><p>that conspiracies about Arafat are on the rise since Arafat\'s </p><p>negotiations with Israel to lift the sieges on the Muqatta </p><p>and the Church of Nativity.  Al-Masri told Poloff that at a </p><p>recent social gathering, an elderly Palestinian refugee </p><p>alleged that Arafat was originally a Jew.  Al-Masri said many </p><p>were now questioning Arafat\'s Palestinian bonafides and even </p><p>al-Masri asked why there were few, if any, records of </p><p>Arafat\'s childhood days in Egypt.  "You can\'t find one </p><p>neighbor or one childhood friend of Arafat!"  Abu Odeh </p><p>reported similar statements and said people here were </p><p>questioning whether Arafat was Palestinian or Egyptian. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) While criticism of Arafat and PA corruption are not </p><p>new, we are seeing a resurgence of criticism of Arafat </p><p>similar to what we were hearing prior to Israeli actions that </p><p>isolated Arafat in the Muqatta.  Still, these recent comments </p><p>suggest that at least two of the more critically thinking </p><p>Palestinian Jordanians are beginning to recognize Arafat\'s </p><p>liabilities.  This does not hold true for the vast majority </p><p>of Palestinian Jordanians who continue to see Arafat not only </p><p>as the President of the PNA, but the symbol of the </p><p>Palestinian struggle as well.  Israeli actions that isolate </p><p>Arafat--such as the re-occupation of Ramallah--only </p><p>strengthen Arafat\'s emotional appeal here, and make it more </p><p>difficult for voices like al-Masri and Abu Odeh to be heard. </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
