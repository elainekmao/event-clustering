<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 004732 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR NP/RA, T, NP/MNA, IO/T AND NEA/NGA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/25/2013 </p><p>TAGS: DA, IR, KNNP, MNUC, PARM, PREL </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY PROMISES FULL SUPPORT FOR THE USG\'S </p><p>IAEA/IRAN STRATEGY, EXPRESSES DEEP CONCERN OVER IRAN\'S </p><p>NUCLEAR AND BALLISTIC MISSILE PROGRAMS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Classified by Charge d\'Affaires ad interim Robert </p><p>Deutsch. Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) SUMMARY. NP A/DAS Mark Fitzpatrick and T Senior </p><p>Advisor David Wurmser were in Ankara on July 24 to consult </p><p>with a team of Turkish MFA officials, led by Ambassador Turan </p><p>Morali (Director-General for International Security Affairs </p><p>and Disarmament), on the way forward in addressing Iran\'s </p><p>nuclear program through the IAEA. Morali and his team </p><p>stressed that Turkey shares USG concerns over the Iranian </p><p>program, and noted that the combination of Iran\'s nuclear </p><p>weapons ambitions and ballistic missile program is </p><p>particularly worrying. Morali expressed full support for </p><p>delivering a tough message to Iran on this issue, both </p><p>bilaterally and within the IAEA. Significantly, he also </p><p>promised to speak with the Egyptians, who have provided </p><p>top-cover to Iran within the IAEA. However, Morali also </p><p>admitted that Turkey will maintain its policy of </p><p>"constructive engagement" with Iran, due to the fact that it </p><p>is a direct neighbor. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>THE USG STRATEGY AND CONCERNS </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The meeting began with Fitzpatrick and Wurmser giving </p><p>an overview of the USG strategy for halting the Iranian </p><p>nuclear weapons program through the IAEA. The USG expects </p><p>that IAEA Director-General El Baradei\'s report to the </p><p>September Board of Governors (BOG) meeting regarding </p><p>inspections in Iran will provide ample evidence of safeguards </p><p>violations. Therefore, the IAEA Board of Governors (BOG) </p><p>should issue a finding of Iranian non-compliance with IAEA </p><p>safeguards requirements to the UN Security Council in </p><p>September. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Fitzpatrick went on to say that it is crucial that the </p><p>wording of the resolution and the votes in favor of it are </p><p>lined up before the BOG meeting. However, El Baradei has said </p><p>that he will issue the report on August 29 -- this allows </p><p>only a week for consideration of the report and international </p><p>consultation before the BOG meeting. The USG is pressing the </p><p>IAEA Secretariat to release the report by August 15, </p><p>Fitzpatrick said, and hopes that Turkey will also weigh in </p><p>with the IAEA on this issue. Fitzpatrick also requested that </p><p>Turkey use any influence that it has on countries like </p><p>Morocco, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt, which have either tended to </p><p>act as apologists for Iran within the IAEA, or have tried to </p><p>expand the Iran issue to include Israel\'s nuclear program and </p><p>a Nuclear Weapons Free Zone in the Middle East. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>TURKEY IS VERY CONCERNED OVER IRAN\'S </p><p>NUCLEAR AND MISSILE PROGRAMS </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Morali said that Turkey is comforted that it is not </p><p>alone in its concerns regarding Iran\'s nuclear program. The </p><p>June BOG meeting demonstrated that many members of the </p><p>international community fully concur with Turkey\'s position </p><p>on the matter -- Iran\'s nuclear weapons program must be </p><p>halted and reversed, and it must prove to the international </p><p>community that its nuclear program is intended only for </p><p>civilian, peaceful purposes. An aggressive strategy on the </p><p>part of the IAEA and like-minded states is integral to this </p><p>effort. To that end, Morali promised that Turkey would </p><p>demarche the Egyptians in an effort to ensure their </p><p>cooperation at the September BOG meeting. Morali also </p><p>expressed concern that Iran would try to "clean up" some of </p><p>its nuclear sites in hopes of hiding incriminating evidence. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Morali and Bulent Tulun (Deputy Director-General for </p><p>Disarmament) agreed with the point made by Fitzpatrick and </p><p>Wurmser that Iran does not need enrichment and reprocessing </p><p>capabilities for a civilian, peaceful nuclear program. Morali </p><p>promised to raise this point with Iranian representatives. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Tulun also pointed out that the combination of Iran\'s </p><p>nuclear and ballistic missile programs is of particular </p><p>concern. Fitzpatrick and Wurmser strongly concurred. Wurmser </p><p>also noted that Iran\'s ballistic missile program is itself </p><p>evidence of an intent to develop nuclear weapons, since it </p><p>does not make strategic sense to develop long-range missiles </p><p>only for the purpose of delivering conventional warheads. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>TURKEY PRESENTS ITS CONCERNS TO IRAN </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Morali stressed that Turkey has made its concerns </p><p>clear to Iran, and provided two specific examples of the </p><p>occasions on which it has done so. He said that the Iranian </p><p>ambassador had recently come to see him, complaining about a </p><p>statement from Turkey in a recent CTBT PREPCOM (Morali told </p><p>him that he must be referring to Turkey\'s statement before </p><p>the June BOG meeting; it had made no such statement to the </p><p>CTBT PREPCOM). Morali told him that Iran must stop stalling </p><p>the IAEA and "open up." The Ambassador claimed that Iran is </p><p>ready to give IAEA inspectors full access and that it is </p><p>ready to sign the Additional Protocol, with one condition: </p><p>that it reflect in writing that Iran will receive </p><p>international assistance with its civilian nuclear program. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Morali reflected that he believed this condition to be </p><p>acceptable, since Iran already receives such assistance from </p><p>the IAEA. However, he also pointed out that Turkey\'s official </p><p>position is that Iran should sign the Additional Protocol </p><p>without condition. Fitzpatrick noted that the USG would not </p><p>support any condition to Iran\'s signing of the Additional </p><p>Protocol. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) The Iranian ambassador also raised the "double </p><p>standards" issue (i.e. the Israeli nuclear program). Morali </p><p>told him that Iran should not push this argument, since if it </p><p>starts pointing fingers at other nuclear powers, that implies </p><p>it too wants to become a nuclear power. Turkey\'s policy is </p><p>clear and consistent: it does not want any of its neighbors </p><p>to have nuclear weapons. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) In addition, the Turkish Prime Minister raised this </p><p>issue with the Iranian Deputy President during a meeting in </p><p>May. The Prime Minister told the Deputy President openly, in </p><p>front of many other participants, that Iran must convince the </p><p>international community that it has nothing to hide. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>THE DIFFICULTY IN ADDRESSING THE PROBLEM </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) At the same time, Morali noted that there are a </p><p>number of factors impeding the effort to convince Iran to </p><p>roll back its nuclear weapons program (besides whatever </p><p>strategic rationale has driven its development). The first is </p><p>that many officials within the Iranian government probably do </p><p>not know the extent of this program within their country. In </p><p>addition, while the reformists don\'t want Iran to be isolated </p><p>within the international community, they are also unlikely to </p><p>push against the nuclear weapons program, for fear of </p><p>recrimination from the conservatives. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>....BUT WE CAN\'T BURN OUR BRIDGES WITH IRAN </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) Morali admitted that Turkey is handling this issue </p><p>very delicately. The fact that Iran is a direct neighbor, and </p><p>that the current Turkish government has some affinity for </p><p>Iran, means that Turkey will maintain its policy of </p><p>"constructive engagement" with Iran. Turkey\'s statement </p><p>before the June BOG, for example, was "balanced," in that it </p><p>did note some areas of Iranian cooperation. Nevertheless, </p><p>Turkey fully concurs that a firm message must be given to </p><p>Iran on this issue, even if Turkey presents its concerns </p><p>quietly, out of the public eye. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) COMMENT: Turkey\'s response to our concerns on Iranian </p><p>proliferation is clear. They will work closely with us </p><p>diplomatically for an international effort to reverse Iran\'s </p><p>program. Nonetheless, given Iran\'s proximity to Turkey, they </p><p>will surely limit public elements of this effort and seek to </p><p>maintain their stance in the bounds of "good neighborliness." </p><p>END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15. (U) This cable has been cleared with A/DAS Fitzpatrick. </p><p>DEUTSCH </p><p></p></div>
