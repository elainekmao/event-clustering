(C) The treason trial of MDC President Morgan Tsvangirai, </p><p>MDC Secretary General Welshman Ncube, and MDC Shadow Minister </p><p>of Agriculture Renson Gasela resumed on May 12 for its ninth </p><p>week after a month-long recess.  According to lead defense </p><p>attorney George Bizos, based on the State\'s weak evidence </p><p>presented so far, the defense intends to move for dismissal </p><p>by the end of May; on May 15 Tsvangirai said he was confident </p><p>that he would be acquitted.  Another defense lawyer, Innocent </p><p>Chagonda, was also confident this week that judge Garwe would </p><p>find it difficult to convict Tsvangirai. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) On May 12 and 13, the defense continued its </p><p>cross-examination of Assistant Police Commissioner Moses </p><p>Magandi.  The State\'s star witness Ari Ben Menashe previously </p><p>said that he had informed Magandi, while they were traveling </p><p>to England for a meeting with Tsvangirai, that he was going </p><p>to the DRC later to meet with Rupert Johnson.  But Magandi </p><p>denied this week that Menashe told him of his trip to the </p><p>DRC.  Bizos also questioned Magandi on whether he had </p><p>informed his superiors that the videotape did not show </p><p>Tsvangirai saying that he wanted to "assassinate" President </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Mugabe.  Magandi admitted that he did not.  When Bizos asked </p><p>Magandi if there were any special identifying marks on the </p><p>videotape and the audiotape that could be used to confirm </p><p>that the tapes in front of them were the correct tapes, </p><p>Magandi admitted that there were no special marks.  However, </p><p>he refused to admit that it would have been easy for anyone </p><p>to change the tapes. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) The prosecution then introduced the next state </p><p>witness, Central Investigation Department (CID) Officer </p><p>Stephen Mutamba.  Although Mutamba admitted that the quality </p><p>of the audiotape was poor, except for one part, he still </p><p>managed to read from a police transcript what the police </p><p>believed Ben Menashe to have said at the second London </p><p>meeting.  During his cross-examination by the defense, </p><p>Mutamba admitted that he had only been looking for evidence </p><p>that would incriminate Morgan Tsvangirai and ignored evidence </p><p>that Tsvangirai had not said anything about "assassinating" </p><p>Mugabe. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) In circumstances where it was obvious that Ben Menashe </p><p>had lied, Magandi and Mutamba preferred to say that they did </p><p>not know what Ben Menashe had said.  Based on misstatements </p><p>Magandi made, the state appeared to have coached the second </p><p>witness, Mutamba, and he was better prepared for </p><p>cross-examination. </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) Although the attendance in court was poor at first, </p><p>toward the end of the week it increased steadily.  On May 12, </p><p>nine members of the MDC women\'s league were arrested after </p><p>they were denied entry to the High Court allegedly because </p><p>they were not dressed appropriately; they were wearing MDC </p><p>t-shirts. </p><p> </p><p>Comment: </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Both witnesses\' testimony appeared to benefit the </p><p>defense more than the prosecution even though they were State </p><p>witnesses.  Under apolitical circumstances we would be </p><p>confident of acquittal.  However, the circumstances are not </p><p>apolitical.  The central questions the GOZ and Judge Garwe </p><p>faces are whether there is any basis under the law for a </p><p>conviction, what would be the political fallout of convicting </p><p>Tsvangirai with such flimsy evidence, and whether the Supreme </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Court would overturn the conviction (which the defense would </p><p>surely appeal).  Judge Garwe, current Judge President of the </p><p>High Court, must also be pondering if his career will outlast </p><p>the current regime, and the potential damage of a conviction </p><p>for his own reputation.  End Comment. </p><p>WHITEHEAD </p><p></p></div>
