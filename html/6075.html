(SBU) SUMMARY: The following is AmEmb Accra\'s response to </p><p>the tasker requesting information for the second annual </p><p>Trafficking in Persons Report. In summary, Ghana has problems </p><p>with both domestic and international human trafficking.  The </p><p>GOG and local NGOs have so far combined efforts to focus on </p><p>combating domestic trafficking in children and the cultural </p><p>complacency that allows such trafficking and the resulting </p><p>child labor to occur.  Efforts to combat international </p><p>trafficking have been hampered by a number of factors: slow </p><p>action on enacting appropriate legislation criminalizing </p><p>trafficking, changes in the directorship of the agencies that </p><p>lead GOG efforts on the issue, and the simple lack of </p><p>resources common to most developing nations. END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) The following responses are keyed to Ref A. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>Para 16: Overview </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>A. (U) Ghana is both a country of origin and a destination </p><p>for internationally trafficked persons.  However, internal </p><p>trafficking is more common than cross-border trafficking. </p><p>The Government does not have official figures on the number </p><p>of trafficked persons, either domestic or cross-border, and </p><p>estimates are difficult to come by and of limited </p><p>reliability. </p><p> </p><p>B. (U) Domestically, most trafficking is in children, with </p><p>northerners more likely to be trafficked than southerners. </p><p>Boys are sent from the Northern Region to work in the fishing </p><p>communities in the Volta Region, and girls from the Northern </p><p>and Eastern Regions to the cities of Accra and Kumasi to work </p><p>as domestic helpers, porters, and assistants to local </p><p>traders. </p><p> </p><p>Internationally, the majority of trafficking involves </p><p>children between the ages of seven and seventeen being </p><p>shipped to and from the neighboring countries of Cote </p><p>d\'Ivoire, Togo, and Nigeria to work as laborers or household </p><p>help, or young women who are shipped to Western Europe, </p><p>mostly to work as prostitutes.  Ghana is also a transit </p><p>country.  There is a growing trade in Nigerian women </p><p>transiting Ghana on their way to Western Europe to work in </p><p>the sex industry, and there is reportedly some trafficking in </p><p>persons from Burkina Faso, going through Ghana on their way </p><p>to Cote d\'Ivoire. </p><p> </p><p>C. (U) Due to a lack of current reliable data, we have not </p><p>been able to detect any appreciable changes in the direction </p><p>or extent of trafficking over the past year. </p><p> </p><p>D. (U) The most detailed studies on child trafficking have </p><p>been done by the African Center for Human Development (April </p><p>2000), and the Ministry of Manpower and Employment in </p><p>conjunction with the ILO (February 2001).  Other local and </p><p>international organizations, both governmental and </p><p>non-governmental, have looked at the issue of trafficking in </p><p>persons, but mostly in the broader context of child labor. </p><p> </p><p>E. (U) Ghana is not a major destination for international </p><p>trafficked victims.  Those trafficked domestically are used </p><p>primarily for labor, such as farming, fishing, housekeeping, </p><p>street vending, and other menial work.  They are either not </p><p>paid at all, or are given very low wages.  Because trafficked </p><p>children are often sent away by families unable to support </p><p>them, and sometimes in exchange for cash payments, they </p><p>cannot easily return home despite their maltreatment. </p><p> </p><p>F. (U) Children from impoverished rural backgrounds are the </p><p>primary victims of trafficking from Ghana to other countries. </p><p> Much of the recruitment of children between the ages of </p><p>eight and fifteen is done with the consent of the parents, </p><p>who are sometimes given an advance payment or promised </p><p>regular stipends from the recruiter.  The parents are told </p><p>the children will receive food, shelter, and often some sort </p><p>of training or education.  Some children are sent to work for </p><p>extended family members in urban areas, who may treat the </p><p>children relatively well.  Many, however, are given to </p><p>professional recruiters, who, upon reaching the cities, hand </p><p>the children off to those who will be their actual employers. </p><p> At that point, the children begin their work as housemaids, </p><p>hawkers, shop assistants, etc.  In many cases, the children </p><p>never receive the education or vocational training the </p><p>recruiters promised.  Young Ghanaian women are also </p><p>reportedly targeted by international traffickers promising </p><p>jobs in Western Europe.  They are sent directly from Ghana to </p><p>Europe, mostly Germany, Italy or the Netherlands, or they may </p><p>be transshipped through neighboring countries.  Once at their </p><p>final destination, they are commonly forced into </p><p>prostitution.  Some young women also end up in the Middle </p><p>East, where they work in menial jobs or as domestic help. </p><p> </p><p>G. (U) The Ghanaian Government continues to show an increased </p><p>awareness of the problem of trafficking and the political </p><p>will to address it. The GOG hosted a Meeting of Experts </p><p>Against Trafficking In Persons on October 23-24, 2001, which </p><p>was sponsored by the Economic Community of West African </p><p>States (ECOWAS) and the United Nations Office for Drug </p><p>Control and Crime Prevention (UNODCCP). GOG attorneys served </p><p>as principal drafters and organizers of the conference. </p><p> </p><p>The resulting "ECOWAS Initial Plan of Action to Combat </p><p>Trafficking in Persons" for 2002-2003, called on member </p><p>states to ratify international and regional anti-crime </p><p>conventions, adopt uniform laws against trafficking in </p><p>persons, implement measures to protect and assist the </p><p>trafficking victims, sensitize and educate government and law </p><p>enforcement officials to view trafficking as a crime, and </p><p>discourage the demand for trafficked persons in their </p><p>countries.  The ECOWAS Plan mandated that states establish an </p><p>operational National Task Force on Trafficking by June 2002 </p><p>and begin national awareness campaigns. </p><p> </p><p>Since the ECOWAS conference, the largest area of action has </p><p>been in prevention through public outreach campaigns. </p><p>Several high-level GOG officials have responded publicly to </p><p>implement Ghana,s National Plan to Combat Trafficking and </p><p>raise public awareness on the issue.  The Vice President </p><p>formally launched Ghana,s National Task Force on Trafficking </p><p>in Persons three months ahead of the ECOWAS deadline at an </p><p>ILO-sponsored conference on child trafficking in Ghana.  This </p><p>conference was attended by a high-level delegation, including </p><p>five ministers.  The Ministry of Justice leads the Task </p><p>Force, which is made up of representatives from the </p><p>Ministries of Manpower Development and Employment, Ministry </p><p>of Women and Children,s Affairs, the National Police, Ghana </p><p>Immigration, and members of Civil Society. </p><p> </p><p>In other examples of public outreach, the Minister of Women </p><p>and Children\'s Affairs and some Members of Parliament seized </p><p>the opportunity presented by commemorative events such as the </p><p>OAU Day of the African Child (June 16, 2002) and National </p><p>Children,s Day (Aug 21, 2002) to heighten national awareness </p><p>of trafficking in children.  A Supreme Court Justice has been </p><p>quoted in the press warning of the dangers and penalties for </p><p>exploiting children.  The Justice, who chairs a National </p><p>Multi-Sectoral Child Protection Committee, was inaugurating a </p><p>branch of the committee in the Brong-Ahafo Region. </p><p> </p><p>Government and law enforcement officials have participated </p><p>extensively in public awareness outreach campaigns as well as </p><p>training programs sponsored by the USG and </p><p>local/international NGOs.  Last Spring, INS Accra and Post </p><p>RSO recommended a rising Ghana Immigration official to attend </p><p>an International Visitor Program on Human Trafficking. </p><p>Several months after the program, that official rose to the </p><p>top to become the Director of Ghana Immigration.  Impressed </p><p>by the program, she helped organize seminars for immigration </p><p>officers to sensitize them on the issue of trafficking. </p><p>Officials from the Ministry of Manpower Development and </p><p>Employment, Social Welfare Division have been engaged in </p><p>ILO/IPEC training and awareness projects on combating child </p><p>labor - the most common form of human trafficking within </p><p>Ghana. GOG officials have worked side-by-side with NGOs in </p><p>distributing posters and bumper stickers, presenting </p><p>theatrical messages in local communities, and encouraging </p><p>school art and essay competitions.  Officials from the </p><p>Department of Social Welfare attended an ILO/IPEC </p><p>"train-the-trainers" workshop on child labor monitoring in </p><p>December 2002. </p><p> </p><p>Second, the GOG has worked closely with NGOs to provide </p><p>protection - focusing on rescue and rehabilitation of </p><p>internally trafficked children.  ILO/IPEC and the Ministry of </p><p>Manpower Development and Employment are currently embarking </p><p>on an initiative to return street children (many of whom are </p><p>runaway trafficking victims) back to their homes in the </p><p>north. This Street Children initiative is part of the </p><p>government,s Poverty Reduction Program funded by a loan from </p><p>the World Bank. Out of the 30 children selected for the </p><p>project, only 18 appeared for the return trip.  Both ILO/IPEC </p><p>and the Ministry are looking for ways to provide more </p><p>counseling and education to the children before attempting to </p><p>repatriate them to their communities.  As the Ministry,s </p><p>Social Welfare Department has limited resources such as </p><p>children,s homes, vehicles, and counselors, the government </p><p>is tapping into the (also limited) resources of local NGOs. </p><p> </p><p>The International Organization for Migration, funded through </p><p>PRM, has begun an initiative to rescue, rehabilitate, and </p><p>return child trafficking victims who are working in fishing </p><p>villages in the Brong-Ahafo Region.  The programs seeks to </p><p>encourage fishermen to release the children in exchange for </p><p>training or equipment that would enable them to fish without </p><p>the use of children.  It is interesting to note that many </p><p>organizations are seeking to address domestic trafficking </p><p>outside the formal legal system.  The problems listed in the </p><p>following paragraph may explain this. </p><p>Prosecution efforts have been the slowest to materialize. </p><p>Many government/law enforcement officials and NGOs complain </p><p>that the lack of specific laws against trafficking impedes </p><p>prosecution of traffickers (who are prosecuted under other </p><p>laws, see para 18, A). Last year,s TIP report noted that </p><p>Ghana,s National Plan involved amending the Ghanaian </p><p>criminal code to define trafficking in persons as a crime. </p><p>The Ministry of Justice has explained that the delay in </p><p>enacting the legislation is due to a decision to draft </p><p>in-depth stand-alone legislation criminalizing trafficking </p><p>rather than amending existing laws. The first draft, which </p><p>among other things would establish specific penalties for </p><p>trafficking is nearly completed.  It is scheduled to soon go </p><p>to stakeholders for comments, and be submitted to Parliament </p><p>for action by Fall 2003.  (COMMENT: Even if Ghana enacts </p><p>anti-trafficking legislation soon, actual prosecution of </p><p>traffickers will likely be slow in coming. The judicial </p><p>system in Ghana is completely under-resourced, (most courts </p><p>lack information technology capability, for example), </p><p>creating an incredible backlog of cases waiting to go to </p><p>trial. END COMMENT) </p><p> </p><p>H. (U) There is no evidence that Government authorities, or </p><p>individual members of government forces, act to facilitate, </p><p>condone, are complicit, take bribes, or assist in trafficking </p><p>operations. </p><p> </p><p>I. (U) The Government is limited in addressing the problem of </p><p>trafficking by both culture and resources.  Child trafficking </p><p>in Ghana is difficult to define.  Children from rural </p><p>communities are commonly sent by their parents to work as </p><p>housemaids for distant relatives in cities.  Given the severe </p><p>poverty that many rural families face, sending a child to </p><p>work for well-off relations in the city, with the hope that </p><p>the child will receive some vocational training or education, </p><p>is regarded as a genuine attempt to improve that child\'s </p><p>opportunities.  The idea that sending children to live with </p><p>extended family under these circumstances is  "trafficking" </p><p>would make no sense to many Ghanaians.  Other, more </p><p>exploitative forms of trafficking, such as cross-border </p><p>trafficking or situations where the children are recruited by </p><p>professionals who traffic them for profit, are recognized as </p><p>problems by the Government, but law enforcement authorities </p><p>are not equipped with adequate training or financial </p><p>resources to deal with the problem. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>Para 17: Prevention </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>A. (U) With the adoption of the ECOWAS Plan in October 2001, </p><p>the GOG has openly acknowledged that trafficking is a </p><p>problem, and with the development of its National Plan, has </p><p>begun to address the problem on a coordinated and systematic </p><p>basis (see para 16, G). </p><p> </p><p>B. (U) See para 16, G. </p><p> </p><p>C. (U) A local NGO, The African Center for Human Development </p><p>(AFCHD), has taken several full-page newspaper advertisements </p><p>on their efforts to combat child trafficking within Ghana, </p><p>and on their new rescue and rehabilitation centers for </p><p>rescued children. They have held numerous workshops for local </p><p>leaders, traditional rulers, social workers and law </p><p>enforcement, as well as radio shows in local languages </p><p>discussing the consequences of trafficking and child labor. </p><p>They report an overwhelming response to their efforts. </p><p>Families and trafficked children are seeking out the </p><p>assistance of the ACFHD.  There are even some local fishermen </p><p>who have volunteered to return trafficked children who work </p><p>for them to their families. </p><p> </p><p>The ILO International Program the Elimination of Child Labor </p><p>(ILO/IPEC) has specific programs to combat trafficking.  They </p><p>also use radio and television programs in local languages to </p><p>sensitize communities in what they call "recruitment areas." </p><p>ILO/IPEC is currently working on flyers of information - </p><p>designed to address the cultural underpinnings of child </p><p>trafficking - to pass out to communities, local </p><p>transportation owners and officials, which should be </p><p>completed by Spring 2003. In addition, they are working with </p><p>the Ghana National Drama Company to portray a television </p><p>drama on trafficking using nationally recognized stars.  This </p><p>film will also be used in sensitization and training </p><p>programs. </p><p> </p><p>U.S. Embassy in Accra funds several gender-based NGOs through </p><p>its Democracy and Human Rights Fund.  These organizations run </p><p>empowerment and education workshops on violence against women </p><p>and children.  INL program funds, administered by the local </p><p>UNDP office in coordination with the Embassy, have funded </p><p>several NGOs as well as the Women and Juvenile Police Unit </p><p>(WAJU), focusing on crisis center establishment, counseling, </p><p>police training and community outreach on abuse of women and </p><p>children.  Although these projects are not specifically </p><p>targeted at trafficking in persons, they are crucial to </p><p>tackling the underlying culture that supports crimes against </p><p>vulnerable populations, such as trafficking in women and </p><p>children.  All of the above efforts have been successful in </p><p>the sense that real needs are being addressed, so much so </p><p>that NGOs and local authorities are starting to feel pressure </p><p>on their resources to adequately deal with rescue, </p><p>rehabilitation and reintegration of trafficked children to </p><p>their homes. </p><p> </p><p>D. (U) The Government of Ghana has agreed to pay ten percent </p><p>of the cost of an ILO/IPEC program called "Combatting </p><p>Trafficking in Children for Labor Exploitation in West and </p><p>Central Africa," which includes both training of government </p><p>and NGO officials in the rehabilitation of trafficked </p><p>children and a public relations campaign.  In addition, the </p><p>GOG supports programs designed to empower women and children </p><p>that indirectly help prevent trafficking.  Certain components </p><p>of the Government\'s National Poverty Reduction Program are </p><p>designed to alleviate child poverty and improve children\'s </p><p>access to education, and the Ministry of Women\'s Affairs runs </p><p>programs which serve to educate women on the importance of </p><p>children\'s education. </p><p> </p><p>E. (U)  The Government does support programs (see above), </p><p>though scarcity of resources is always a problem. </p><p> </p><p>F. (U) The Government\'s relationship with NGOs, international </p><p>organizations, and civil society is constructive. </p><p> </p><p>G. (U) The Director of Ghana Immigration is committed to </p><p>combating human trafficking and has begun training officers </p><p>to detect human trafficking.  However, the GOG does not have </p><p>the required resources to adequately monitor and control </p><p>Ghana\'s lengthy land borders.  The lack of sufficient data to </p><p>monitor immigration patterns, for example, stems from the </p><p>lack of communication infrastructure between border posts and </p><p>their regional offices. </p><p> </p><p>H. (U) See para 16, G. </p><p> </p><p>I. (U) See para 16, G.  In addition, the Ministry of Manpower </p><p>Development and Employment has conducted studies on child </p><p>labor with the ILO which touch on the problem of trafficking </p><p>in children. </p><p> </p><p>J. (U) The GOG does have a National Plan to Combat </p><p>Trafficking as well as a National Task Force made up of the </p><p>Ministries of Justice, Manpower Development and Employment, </p><p>and Women and Children,s Affairs, the National Police, Ghana </p><p>Immigration, and members of Civil Society.  The Task Force </p><p>has had a slow start after the initial inauguration, in large </p><p>part because of changes in directorships in important </p><p>Ministries such as Manpower Development and Employment. </p><p>However, most of the same actors are involved in a joint </p><p>GOG-ILO/IPEC Steering Committee to Combat Trafficking at a </p><p>lower, more functional level, which helps coordinate </p><p>trafficking programs nationwide. </p><p> </p><p>K. (U)  The Ministry of Justice has the lead on developing </p><p>the new law against trafficking.  The Ministry of Manpower </p><p>Development and Employment takes the lead on the program </p><p>level to combating child labor as well as child trafficking. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p>Para 18, Investigation and Prosecution of Traffickers </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p>A. (U) There is no specific provision in Ghanaian law </p><p>outlawing trafficking in persons.  There are laws against </p><p>slavery, prostitution, rape (or child rape, termed </p><p>"defilement"), use of underage labor, manufacture of </p><p>fraudulent documentation, etc.  Traffickers are prosecuted </p><p>under these statutes.  However, the Ministry of Justice is </p><p>currently finalizing a draft law criminalizing human </p><p>trafficking that will soon go out to stakeholders for </p><p>comment.  It is estimated the draft legislation will go to </p><p>Parliament in the Fall 2003. </p><p>B. (U) There are currently no specific penalties for </p><p>trafficking, but penalties for related offenses range from </p><p>six months to 25 years (see above). </p><p> </p><p>C. (U) In June 1998, Parliament passed comprehensive </p><p>legislation to protect women and children\'s rights.  The bill </p><p>doubled the mandatory sentence for rape, making it punishable </p><p>by 5 to 25 years in prison.  It also banned the practice of </p><p>ritual servitude, criminalized indecent assault and forced </p><p>marriage, and raised the punishments for defilement, incest, </p><p>and prostitution involving children.  There is no specific </p><p>penalty for trafficking in persons, although a specific </p><p>penalty is envisioned for the trafficking law being drafted. </p><p> </p><p>D. (U) Traffickers have been prosecuted under statutes listed </p><p>in para 18, A.  Penalties imposed range from several months </p><p>to many years in prison. Sentences for rape or defilement, </p><p>for example, are often 10 to 15 years in length.  Information </p><p>on sentencing of traffickers is not kept separately from </p><p>other data on sentencing for rape, kidnapping, and other </p><p>offenses for which traffickers can be prosecuted. </p><p> </p><p>E. (U) Within Ghana, brokers or recruiters procure children </p><p>from rural areas and move them to the locations where they </p><p>will work (see para 16, F).  These recruiters may move as </p><p>many as ten children at one time.  Internationally, some </p><p>trafficking groups are reportedly taking advantage of Ghana\'s </p><p>growing international air links by moving Nigerian women </p><p>through Ghana to Europe as a way of avoiding stricter airport </p><p>controls in Nigeria. </p><p> </p><p>F. (U) Local law enforcement does not use any special </p><p>techniques in the detection or investigation of trafficking; </p><p>however, there are several current cases involving detection </p><p>of trafficking by police through tip-offs by local residents, </p><p>and arrests have been made (under the related offenses </p><p>mentioned above). </p><p> </p><p>G. (U) The National Plan to Combat Trafficking includes a </p><p>training component for police and immigration officials. </p><p>Presently, Ghana Immigration does attempt to identify </p><p>traffickers and trafficked persons through the detection of </p><p>fraudulent documentation.  In the past year, Ghana </p><p>Immigration Service (GIS) has been successful in stopping </p><p>child traffickers in the north of Ghana.  INS Accra and Post </p><p>RSO recommended three candidates from GIS and the National </p><p>Police to participate in the International Visitors\' Program </p><p>for training in connection with human trafficking.  The </p><p>candidates traveled in the Spring of 2002. This program </p><p>inspired the GIS official, who shortly after the IVP program </p><p>rose to Director, to provide seminars to her officers. INS </p><p>Accra, as well as the immigration services of other Embassies </p><p>in Ghana, have trained GIS officials in the detection of fake </p><p>documents such as passports and visas.  GIS has been </p><p>receptive to such training, and has called on INS and </p><p>Consular officials on many occasions when they have had </p><p>questions about travelers going to the U.S. who they suspect </p><p>may be victims of trafficking.  Many government officials and </p><p>law enforcement agencies have attended training sponsored by </p><p>local and international NGOs in the past year. </p><p> </p><p>H. (U) See para 16, G, for discussion of GOG cooperation with </p><p>its neighbors in the ECOWAS sub-region.  In addition, Ghana </p><p>Immigration has been very receptive to training in the </p><p>detection of fake documents and other techniques to prevent </p><p>trafficking and various forms of illegal immigration (see </p><p>above). </p><p> </p><p>I. (U) We have no examples of the extradition of accused </p><p>traffickers. </p><p>J. (SBU) There is no evidence of government involvement in or </p><p>tolerance of international trafficking.  However, it is more </p><p>difficult to assess the Government\'s position on domestic </p><p>trafficking.  It is commonplace for poor children from rural </p><p>areas to go to cities to work as domestic help for extended </p><p>family relations.  This is not viewed as "trafficking" and is </p><p>not illegal in Ghana, but is seen as a way of giving the </p><p>children improved opportunity. </p><p> </p><p>K. (U) We are unaware of any Government officials involved in </p><p>trafficking. </p><p> </p><p>L. (U) Ghanaian Parliament ratified ILO Convention 182 in May </p><p>2001.  Ghana ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of the </p><p>Child in 1989, becoming one of the first countries do so. </p><p>The Government passed a Children\'s Act in 1998, which </p><p>specifies the rights of children in Ghana and codifies the </p><p>law in such areas as child custody, health, and education. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>Para 19, Protection and Assistance to Victims </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>A. (U) Any protection or shelter given to the victims of </p><p>trafficking, either international or domestic, is done on a </p><p>case-by-case basis, as resources are limited.  In many cases, </p><p>the authorities do try to reunite trafficked and abused </p><p>children with their families.  NGOs have sought to provide </p><p>services the police and social services cannot by </p><p>establishing a few crisis centers. However, as awareness of </p><p>the problem grows and trafficking victims seek assistance, </p><p>the limited resources for providing such assistance becomes </p><p>more strapped. </p><p> </p><p>B. (U) See para 17, D. </p><p> </p><p>C. (U) If they are arrested, the victims of international </p><p>trafficking are prosecuted on an occasional, case-by-case </p><p>basis, for offenses such as possession of altered travel </p><p>documents.  In 2000, Ghana Immigration officials detained six </p><p>PRC nationals with fake U.S. visas who were being trafficked </p><p>through Accra from Hong Kong to the United States.  The PRC </p><p>nationals were prosecuted for possession of counterfeit </p><p>documents and sentenced to six months in a local prison. </p><p> </p><p>D. (SBU) We are unaware of trafficking victims\' being </p><p>encouraged to seek redress against traffickers. </p><p> </p><p>E. (U) The Government does not provide specific protection </p><p>for victims of trafficking beyond those available to all </p><p>crime victims or witnesses. </p><p> </p><p>F. (U) Aside from Ghana Immigration,s internal trafficking </p><p>seminars, Post is not aware of any other GOG funded training. </p><p>Much of the specialized training for officials in the past </p><p>year has been sponsored by NGOs with outside donor funds. </p><p>The Women and Juvenile Unit (WAJU) of the National Police, </p><p>using INL funds, is currently working on internal training as </p><p>well as community outreach initiatives on trafficking and </p><p>domestic violence issues. </p><p> </p><p>G. (U) Repatriated victims of trafficking are given </p><p>assistance on an ad hoc basis.  Though the Government has no </p><p>formal program to provide assistance to victims of </p><p>trafficking per se, WAJU assists victims of abuse and </p><p>violence, including trafficking victims.  Crisis centers are </p><p>extremely few. The Department of Social Welfare has a few </p><p>children,s homes and remand homes, but these are generally </p><p>inappropriate and inadequate to deal with trafficking </p><p>victims.
