(S) RELATIONS WITH MILITARY FORCES - ALL UN AGENCIES WORKING </p><p>ON THE GROUND WILL NEED TO INTERACT WITH THE COALITION </p><p>MILITARY AUTHORITIES.  IN WFP\'S VIEW, THESE LINKAGES SHOULD </p><p>BE STRENGTHENED PRIOR TO THE START OF THE CONFLICT AND SHOULD </p><p>NOT BE CONFINED SOLELY TO ISSUES RELATED WITH THE COORDINATES </p><p>OF THE HUMANITARIAN OPERATIONAL SITES.

IT </p><p>WAS NOTED THAT HISTORICALLY IRAQ HAS IMPORTED TWO-THIRDS OF </p><p>ITS BASIC FOOD NEEDS. </p><p> </p><p>                          SECRET </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  00371  02 OF 03  062223Z </p><p>5.  (S) THE PRESENT DISTRIBUTION PROCESS - WFP STARTED WITH THE </p><p>BASIC ASSUMPTION THAT HOUSEHOLD FOOD STOCKS (FROM THE OUTSET </p><p>OF CONFLICT) WOULD BE ADEQUATE TO LAST FOR ONE MONTH.  USAID </p><p>AGREED WITH THIS ASSESSMENT.  WFP IRAQ COUNTRY DIRECTOR DUE </p><p>CONFIRMED THAT THE GOI WAS PRESENTLY FINALIZING FOOD </p><p>DISTRIBUTION PLANS FOR APRIL/MAY AT SOMEWHAT REDUCED LEVELS </p><p>(DUE TO LACK OF SOME ITEMS SUCH AS PULSES) AND HE ESTIMATED </p><p>THAT THESE RATIONS WOULD LAST THROUGH MID-TO-END APRIL.  WFP </p><p>BELIEVES THAT MANY POOR FAMILIES, THE MOST FOOD INSECURE, ARE </p><p>SELLING A PORTION OF THE PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM (PDS) </p><p>FOOD RECEIVED IN ORDER TO MEET THEIR OTHER ESSENTIAL </p><p>REQUIREMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (S) STANDBY BORROWING ARRANGMENTS - ON REGIONAL BORROWING, </p><p>WFP REPORTED A 100,000 MT CEREALS "LINE OF CREDIT" SIGNED </p><p>AGREEMENT WITH SYRIA.  WITH IRAN, THERE IS A QUASI-AGREEMENT </p><p>TO BORROW UP TO 40,000 MT OF WHEAT; IN KUWAIT, CONVERSATIONS </p><p>ARE IN PROGRESS RELATED TO COMMODITY LOANS OF UP TO 200,000 </p><p>MT, BUT THERE ARE QUALITY ISSUES RELATED TO ANY IN-KIND </p><p>PAYBACK. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (S) WFP REVIEWED REGIONAL PURCHASE OPTIONS AND TIME FRAMES </p><p>FOR PROCUREMENT IN KAZAKHSTAN, INDIA, DUBAI, KUWAIT, AND </p><p>ELSEWHERE IN THE REGION.  MILLING CAPACITY OUTSIDE IRAQ </p><p>(WHEAT INTO WHEAT FLOUR) WAS DISCUSSED.  WFP ESTIMATED THAT </p><p>COSTS FOR FOOD PROCUREMENT, MILLING AND TRANSPORT, WOULD </p><p>AMOUNT TO APPROXIMATELY 270 MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE FIRST </p><p>MONTH\'S SUPPLY, AND CONTRACTS NEEDED TO BE TENDERED URGENTLY. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (S) ON START UP COSTS, WFP ESTIMATED AN IMMEDIATE </p><p>ORGANIZATIONAL NEED FOR U.S. DOLLARS 82 MILLION FOR FUEL, </p><p>                          SECRET </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  00371  02 OF 03  062223Z </p><p>CONTRACTED SERVICES, UNHAS, STAFF DEPLOYMENT, COMMUNICATIONS </p><p>SERVICES AND EQUIPMENT, VEHICLES AND SUPPLIES.  OF THIS SUM, </p><p>42 MILLION DOLLARS IS FOR FUEL.  THIS INVESTMENT IS REQUIRED </p><p>FOR RUNNING A LOGISTICAL OPERATION TO DELIVER OVER ONE </p><p>MILLION TONS OF BASIC FOODS (IN MONTHS TWO AND THREE) THAT </p><p>WOULD KEEP THE PDS FUNCTIONING IN 18 GOVERNORATES AND </p><p>SUPPLYING MORE THAN 43,000 FOOD AGENT DISTRIBUTION POINTS. </p><p>WFP REMARKED ON THE IMPORTANCE OF BUDGETING FOR THE SALARIES </p><p>OF PDS PERSONNEL IN THIS TRANSITION PERIOD.  IT IS IMPERATIVE </p><p>THAT THE PDS SYSTEM REMAIN OPERATIONAL. NOTE: BY SOME POINT </p><p>IN MONTH FOUR, IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE OIL-FOR-FOOD SHIPMENTS </p><p>WOULD BE RESUMED AND THAT THE PDS WOULD RETURN TO FUNCTIONING </p><p>NORMALLY.  END NOTE. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (S) ON THE OIL-FOR-FOOD ISSUE (THE CURRENT PIPELINE IS AN </p><p>ESTIMATED U.S. DOLLARS 2.6 BILLION) GRAISSE RELATED A </p><p>CONVERSATION WITH UN U/S FRECHETTE SUGGESTING A CLOSER </p><p>WORKING RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN OCHA, UNICEF AND WFP WITH THE </p><p>OIL-FOR-FOOD GROUP.  WFP SUGGESTED THE URGENCY OF OBTAINING </p><p>GUIDANCE FROM THE SECURITY COUNCIL AND AUTHORIZATION ON THE </p><p>UTILIZATION BY THE UNITED NATIONS (AS APPROPRIATE) OF PROGRAM </p><p>ASSETS IN THE OIL-FOR-FOOD PIPELINE. </p><p> </p><p>11.
