(C) SUMMARY:  THE GOC INITIATED A COMMENT AND DISCUSSION </p><p>PERIOD FOR A DRAFT NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR ROMA IN MARCH, AND </p><p>WOULD LIKE TO FINALIZE THE PLAN BY THE FALL.  NGOS TELL US </p><p>THE DRAFT PLAN IS A WELCOME EFFORT TO ADDRESS THE SEVERE </p><p>OBSTACLES FACED BY THE ROMA IN CROATIA, BUT FALLS SHORT ON </p><p>THE DETAILS AND FUNDING.  PRONE TO RELY ON EXPRESSIONS OF </p><p>INTENT WHEN IT COMES TO ADDRESSING BROAD SOCIAL PROBLEMS, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00836  01 OF 02  151548Z </p><p>SUCH AS ESTABLISHING A NATIONAL STRATEGY, IT REMAINS TO BE </p><p>SEEN IF THE GOVERNMENT WILL TAKE MEANINGFUL ACTIONS TO </p><p>IMPROVE THE LIVES OF ROMA IN CROATIA.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) ANTE SIMONIC, DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER, ASSEMBLED A </p><p>WORKING GROUP LATE LAST YEAR TO DRAFT A NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR </p><p>ROMA.  THE GOC OFFICE FOR NATIONAL MINORITIES IS PLAYING A </p><p>COORDINATING ROLE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE NATIONAL </p><p>STRATEGY, AND HAS RECEIVED SUPPORT FROM OSCE/OHIDR AND THE </p><p>COUNCIL OF EUROPE.  ON MARCH 12 THE GOVERNMENT HELD A PUBLIC </p><p>ROUNDTABLE TO PRESENT THE DRAFT NATIONAL STRATEGY, AND </p><p>SIMONIC ANNOUNCED THERE WOULD BE A PERIOD OF PUBLIC </p><p>DISCUSSION AND COMMENT BEFORE A FINAL REPORT WOULD BE </p><p>PRESENTED TO THE GOVERNMENT.  ONCE THE GOVERNMENT APPROVES </p><p>THE REPORT IT WILL BE PRESENTED TO PARLIAMENT FOR ADOPTION. </p><p>MLENA KLAJNER, ACTING HEAD OF THE GOVERNMENT OFFICE FOR </p><p>NATIONAL MINORITIES, TOLD US THE NATIONAL STRATEGY IS NOT </p><p>LIKELY TO BE ADOPTED BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) THE DRAFT NATIONAL STRATEGY CONTAINS A LONG LIST OF </p><p>LARGELY GOVERNMENT-DIRECTED ACTIVITIES IN EDUCATION, </p><p>GOVERNANCE, SOCIAL WELFARE, EMPLOYMENT, INTERNAL AFFAIRS, </p><p>CULTURE, AND HOUSING.  THE PROPOSED ACTIVITIES CONSIST OF </p><p>LONG-TERM, MEDIUM-TERM, AND SHORT-TERM TASKS THAT ARE TO BE </p><p>UNDERTAKEN BY GOVERNMENT MINISTRIES AND INSTITUTIONS, NGOS, </p><p>AND THE ROMA COMMUNITY.  ROMA REPRESENTATIVES ARE TO BE </p><p>SYSTEMATICALLY INVOLVED IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PLAN </p><p>THROUGH PARTICIPATION IN LOCAL SELF-GOVERNMENT, AND THROUGH </p><p>THE COMMITTEE FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NATIONAL PROGRAM </p><p>FOR ROMA.  THE COMMITTEE, TO CONSIST OF NINE REPRESENTATIVES </p><p>OF RELEVANT MINISTRIES AND GOVERNMENT OFFICES, SEVEN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00836  01 OF 02  151548Z </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES FROM ROMA COUNCILS, AND ONE REPRESENTATIVE </p><p>FROM A HUMAN RIGHTS NGO, WILL MEET "AS NECESSARY" TO MONITOR </p><p>THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NATIONAL STRATEGY. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) THE CROATIA HELSINKI COMMITTEE (HHO), THE MOST ACTIVE </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS NGO IN CROATIA WORKING ON ROMA ISSUES, TOLD US </p><p>THAT WHILE THE GOVERNMENT IS WELL-INTENTIONED THE NATIONAL </p><p>STRATEGY IS REALLY ADDRESSING "LUXURY ITEMS" RATHER THAN </p><p>BASIC NEEDS, AND IS BETTER SUITED TO A DEVELOPED COUNTRY </p><p>RATHER THAN CROATIA.  HHO FURTHER FAULTED THE GOC FOR NOT </p><p>TAKING A HUMAN RIGHTS APPROACH TO THE DOCUMENT, AND FOR NOT </p><p>INCLUDING ANYONE FROM OUTSIDE THE GOVERNMENT IN THE INITIAL </p><p>DRAFTING.  ON THE OTHER HAND, HHO PRAISED THE GOC FOR THE </p><p>EFFORT, CITING IT AS THE FIRST SYSTEMATIC ATTEMPT TO ADDRESS </p><p>PROBLEMS FACING THE ROMA POPULATION IN CROATIA.  HHO WILL </p><p>CLOSELY MONITOR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NATIONAL STRATEGY. </p><p>"CHILDREN FIRST," A LOCAL NGO WITH LONG EXPERIENCE IN WORKING </p><p>WITH THE ROMA, REJECTED WHAT IT TERMED THE "GHETTOIZATION" </p><p>INHERENT IN SEPARATE SOLUTIONS FOR THE ROMA PROPOSED IN THE </p><p>NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR PROBLEMS FACED BY ALL THOSE IN POVERTY. </p><p> WHILE WELCOME, PROPOSED EFFORTS TO EXPAND EARLY CHILDHOOD </p><p>EDUCATION WERE CRITICIZED AS NOT GOING FAR ENOUGH. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) ROMA NGOS SUCCESSFULLY HELD A FIRST CONGRESS OF ROMA </p><p>IN CROATIA IN FEBRUARY 2003 AND UNANIMOUSLY SUPPORTED THE </p><p>NATIONAL STRATEGY.  HOWEVER, ACCORDING TO HHO, ROMA VIEW THE </p><p>NATIONAL STRATEGY AS "TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT."  AS A </p><p>DISEMPOWERED COMMUNITY, ROMA SUPPORT FOR THE GOVERNMENT IS A </p><p>GIVEN.  UNFORTUNATELY, ROMA NGOS ARE FRACTIOUS AND NUMEROUS </p><p>-- CERTAINLY IN COMPARISON TO THEIR SMALL NUMBER, PERHAPS </p><p>30-40,000 IN THE CROATIAN POPULATION AS A WHOLE -- AND HAVE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00836  01 OF 02  151548Z </p><p>DIFFICULTY IN WORKING TOGETHER IN PURSUIT OF COMMON GOALS. </p><p>NON-ROMA NGOS THAT ARE ACTIVELY ENGAGED ON ROMA ISSUES ARE </p><p>UNANIMOUS IN THEIR VIEW THAT THE ROMA ARE INCAPABLE OF </p><p>EFFECTIVELY WORKING ON THEIR OWN BEHALF.  BOJAN MUNJIN, WHO </p><p>FOLLOWS ROMA ISSUES FOR THE HHO, SAID THE ROMA WERE A "SAD </p><p>AND DEPRESSED COMMUNITY" WHO ARE SO POORLY EDUCATED THAT THEY </p><p>HAVEN\'T "THE TOOLS OR IMPLEMENTS" TO FIGHT FOR THEIR RIGHTS. </p><p>KLAJNER TOLD US THERE ARE OVER 50 ROMA NGOS, AND THAT A </p><p>SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY GIVEN TO THOSE NGOS ENDS UP IN </p><p>PRIVATE POCKETS, AN ASSESSMENT SHARED BY MANY IN THE DONOR </p><p>COMMUNITY.  SHE SAID IT IS NOT UNCOMMON FOR DIFFERENT </p><p>BROTHERS IN THE SAME FAMILY TO HEAD UP SEPARATE AND COMPETING </p><p>NGOS. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) BLANKA SHEGOVIC, DIRECTOR OF "CHILDREN FIRST," HAS </p><p>WORKED WITH THE ROMA COMMUNITY FOR AT LEAST SEVEN YEARS, </p><p>ESTABLISHING PLAY GROUPS AND PRE-SCHOOL PROGRAMS DESIGNED TO </p><p>HELP ROMA CHILDREN STAY IN SCHOOL.  SHE TOLD US THAT FEW ROMA </p><p>NGOS ARE ENGAGED IN ACTIVITIES FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE ROMA </p><p>COMMUNITY, BUT RATHER EXIST AS A MEANS FOR THE LEADER TO </p><p>ESTABLISH A POWER BASE SECURED BY FUNDING PROVIDED BY DONORS. </p><p> MANY ROMA DO NOT WANT NON-ROMA NGOS INVOLVED IN ROMA ISSUES. </p><p> SHEGOVIC RECALLED AN ENCOUNTER THAT ILLUSTRATED THE POINT, </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ0567 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  00836  02 OF 02  151548Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   AMAD-00  CIAE-00  INL-00   DODE-00  SRPP-00 </p><p>      EB-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01   L-00     NSAE-00 </p><p>      NSCE-00  OIC-02   OPIC-01  PA-00    PRS-00   P-00     SP-00 </p><p>      SS-00    STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  ECA-00   PRM-00   DRL-01 </p><p>      G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00    /005W </p><p>                  ------------------563401  151646Z /38 </p><p>R 151547Z APR 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 9965 </p><p>INFO EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES COLLECTIVE </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 ZAGREB 000836 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/15/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, HR </p><p>SUBJECT: ANOTHER PROBLEM SOLVED? -- CROATIA FLOATS NATIONAL </p><p>STRATEGY FOR ROMA </p><p> </p><p>AND LEFT HER SPEECHLESS: A ROMA NGO LEADER COMPLAINED TO HER </p><p>"YOU ARE GETTING RICH ON OUR CHILDREN WHEN IT SHOULD BE US </p><p>GETTING RICH ON OUR CHILDREN."  MOST ROMA NGO LEADERS NEVER </p><p>COMPLETED ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, AND SEVERAL ARE ILLITERATE.  OF </p><p>THE ENTIRE ROMA POPULATION OF CROATIA, ESTIMATES ARE THAT NOT </p><p>MORE THAN 100 CHILDREN ARE ATTENDING SECONDARY SCHOOLS. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) COMMENT:  THE GOC HAS A RECORD OF TRYING TO ADDRESS </p><p>BROAD SOCIAL PROBLEMS -- GENDER, TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS, AND </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00836  02 OF 02  151548Z </p><p>NOW THE ROMA -- VIA NATIONAL STRATEGIES.  INVARIABLY THEY </p><p>DESCRIBE A LARGE NUMBER OF ACTIVITIES, BUT ARE SHORT ON </p><p>DETAIL, AND CONTAIN UNREALISTIC DEADLINES AND VAGUE LINES OF </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY.  IN ADDITION, FUNDING FOR ACTIVITIES IS </p><p>USUALLY NOT ADDRESSED.  THE ROMA STRATEGY INCLUDES SOME </p><p>SPECIFIC BUDGET ESTIMATES; WE COUNTED OVER $4 MILLION FOR </p><p>ACTIVITIES IN 2003 ALONE, BUT THERE IS NO INDICATION WHERE </p><p>THAT MONEY WILL COME FROM, OR IF THE GOC WILL BE ABLE TO </p><p>ALLOCATE FUNDING FOR ACTIVITIES THIS YEAR.  NATIONAL </p><p>STRATEGIES SOUND GOOD IN THEORY, BUT AT THEIR BEST THEY </p><p>REMAIN AN EXPRESSION OF INTENT -- WHETHER OR NOT THE GOC WILL </p><p>FOLLOW THROUGH WITH CONCRETE ACTION ON ISSUES OF CONCERN TO </p><p>THE ROMA REMAINS TO BE SEEN.  END COMMENT. </p><p>ROSSIN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
