<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 003732 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/09/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY\'S OPPOSITION CHP DEVELOPS "NUANCES" ON EU </p><p>POLICY IN WAKE OF MAY 28 NSC MEETING </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ANKARA 3509 </p><p>     B. ANKARA 3618 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Acting Political Counselor Nicholas S. </p><p>Kass.  Reason: 1.5 (b)(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Ref A noted main opposition CHP\'s general support for </p><p>the AK government\'s sixth EU reform package, which could be </p><p>brought to Parliament perhaps as early as this week. </p><p>However, in light of the May 28 NSC meeting and the </p><p>well-publicized opposition to the reform process among </p><p>hardliners in the military leadership (ref B), there are </p><p>signs that CHP is beginning to shift its stance on AK </p><p>EU-related efforts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Several CHP M.P.s -- including Bulent Tanla and </p><p>Foreign Affairs Committee member Hasim Oral -- have asserted </p><p>to us privately that the party will continue to support the </p><p>government\'s effort "fully and unconditionally." </p><p>Nevertheless, other, senior CHP M.P.s -- Deputy Group </p><p>Chairman Haluk Koc and Central Administrative Board member </p><p>Fuat Cay -- offered to us June 9 a more nuanced version of </p><p>the party\'s approach on the issues. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) While professing CHP\'s commitment to the EU, Koc and </p><p>Cay listed their objections to the current reform package: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Both claimed that allowing foreign observers to monitor </p><p>Turkish elections, as currently envisioned in the AK </p><p>government\'s draft, is unacceptable.  Turkey already allows </p><p>OSCE observers, they argued.  "We are not Armenia or </p><p>Azerbaijan," said Koc.  "We aren\'t a third world democracy, </p><p>are we?" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Koc noted that CHP does not want state-owned TRT </p><p>television to be involved in any way in Kurdish broadcasting </p><p>-- another key, and controversial, provision in the AK </p><p>government\'s plan.  Koc worried that "if Kurdish is allowed </p><p>to run on TRT, then legally State television will have to </p><p>give voice to all Turkish minorities," even the Circassians, </p><p>(who have long been integrated into the "Turkish" ethnic body </p><p>politic). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Cay strongly objected to the inclusion of a measure that </p><p>would allow the establishment of places of worship in </p><p>apartment buildings.  "This has nothing to do with the EU. </p><p>We already have more mosques -- 80,000 -- than schools -- </p><p>60,000." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- While both endorsed AK\'s efforts to abolish article 8 of </p><p>the anti-terror law, Cay volunteered that "other mechanisms </p><p>exist, like article 312 of the penal code" (note: under which </p><p>PM Erdogan was jailed in 1999.  End note) to protect the </p><p>interests and equities of the Turkish State. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) June 9 mainstream press reports indicate that AK is </p><p>shelving the provision on places of worship.  Nevertheless, </p><p>this is precisely the kind of issue that routinely raises the </p><p>hackles of -- and provides ammunition to -- the "Party of </p><p>Ataturk" and the Kemalist secularist elites, whom CHP </p><p>represents.  The party\'s subtle shift almost certainly </p><p>reflects attempts by Chairman Baykal -- known for aggressive </p><p>tactics of limited effectiveness -- to curry favor both with </p><p>the voters and military hard-liners.  The comments of Cay and </p><p>Koc, particularly with respect to Article 8 issues, appear to </p><p>reflect such considerations.  CHP\'s tactics could complicate </p><p>the reform package\'s prospects -- particularly if AK bucks </p><p>long-held Turkish State shibboleths and submits the package </p><p>to Parliament as promised before the NSC\'s meeting at the end </p><p>of June. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
