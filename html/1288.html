(C) SUMMARY: ON SEPTEMBER 21, DCM AND POLOFF CALLED </p><p>ON NEWLY APPOINTED DEPUTY MINISTER FOR EDUCATION, </p><p>SPORTS, AND CULTURE AENEAS CHIGWEDERE.  THE DEPUTY </p><p>MINISTER, A RELIABLE EMBASSY INTERLOCUTOR IN HIS EARLIER </p><p>POSITIONS, WAS CHARACTERISTICALLY FRANK IN HIS </p><p>DISCUSSION OF ZANU-PF POLITICS AND HIS WARNING OF DIRE </p><p>CONSEQUENCES FOR ZIMBABWE IF THE U.S. CONGRESS PASSES </p><p>THE ZIMBABWE DEMOCRACY ACT (ZDA).  WHILE RECOGNIZING THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S FAILINGS SINCE INDEPENDENCE, AND EVEN </p><p>CALLING MUGABE A LIABILITY, CHIGWEDERE ARGUED THAT </p><p>PASSAGE OF THE ZDA WOULD ONLY ACCELERATE CHAOS IN </p><p>ZIMBABWE.  ALTHOUGH WE SEE CHIGWEDERE AS A REALIST, </p><p>ZIMBABWE HAS MUCH FARTHER TO FALL BEFORE HIS WORST CASE </p><p>SCENARIO IS REALIZED.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) ON SEPTEMBER 21, DCM AND POLOFF CALLED ON NEWLY </p><p>APPOINTED DEPUTY MINISTER FOR EDUCATION, SPORTS, AND </p><p>CULTURE AENEAS CHIGWEDERE.  CHIGWEDERE, A SECOND-TERM </p><p>MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT, HAS BEEN A RELIABLE AND UNUSUALLY </p><p>FRANK INTERLOCUTOR FOR THE EMBASSY.  DCM CONGRATULATED </p><p>CHIGWEDERE ON HIS APPOINTMENT, AND THE DEPUTY MINISTER </p><p>POINTED OUT THAT THE MINISTRY HAS AN ALL NEW LEADERSHIP, </p><p>INCLUDING A NEW MINISTER AND PERMANENT SECRETARY. </p><p>CHIGWEDERE WENT ON TO SAY BLUNTLY THAT PRESIDENT MUGABE </p><p>HAD APPOINTED NEW BLOOD INTO THE MINISTRY TO IMPLEMENT </p><p>REFORM, SINCE THE OLD LEADERSHIP WOULD HAVE JUST SLOWED </p><p>THINGS DOWN. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  05352  01 OF 02  221133Z </p><p> </p><p>ZDA TO UNLEASH MILITARY RESPONSE? </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) THE DEPUTY MINISTER QUICKLY TURNED TO THE </p><p>ZIMBABWE DEMOCRACY ACT (ZDA) CURRENTLY BEFORE THE U.S. </p><p>HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.  (NOTE: THE ZDA, AS WRITTEN, </p><p>WOULD END ALL BILATERAL ASSISTANCE TO THE GOZ.  HOWEVER, </p><p>NEARLY ALL U.S. ASSISTANCE TO ZIMBABWE IS DISBURSED </p><p>THROUGH NGOS AND WOULD BE EXEMPT.  END NOTE.)  DCM </p><p>EXPLAINED THAT WE CANNOT PREDICT IF THE ZDA WILL PASS OR </p><p>NOT.  THE EXECUTIVE DOES NOT HAVE THE POWER TO TURN OFF </p><p>THE BILL, BUT IF IT IS NOT ACTED UPON BEFORE CONGRESS IS </p><p>DUE TO ADJOURN ON OR ABOUT OCTOBER 6, THE ZDA WILL DIE </p><p>IN COMMITTEE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) CHIGWEDERE PREDICTED THAT IF THE ZDA DOES PASS, </p><p>IT WILL LEAD TO AN ARMY TAKEOVER.  WHEN ASKED TO EXPLAIN </p><p>HOW THIS MIGHT HAPPEN, CHIGWEDERE SAID THE ZDA WOULD </p><p>ACCELERATE ZIMBABWE\'S ECONOMIC DECLINE AND LEAD TO </p><p>UNREST THAT WOULD FORCE THE ARMY TO INTERVENE. </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN URBANITES WOULD NOT "LIFT A FINGER" TO OPPOSE </p><p>THE MILITARY BECAUSE OF THE MEMORY OF THE RECENT </p><p>ELECTIONS AND THE MATABELELAND MASSACRES OF THE 1980S, </p><p>AND ZIMBABWE WOULD BE STUCK WITH A MILITARY GOVERNMENT </p><p>FOR THREE TO FIVE YEARS.  THERE IS NO DOUBT OF THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S FAILURES SINCE INDEPENDENCE, CHIGWEDERE </p><p>OPINED, BUT THE MILITARY, POLICE, AND WAR VETERANS WOULD </p><p>NEVER PERMIT A GOVERNMENT THAT WAS NOT SYMPATHETIC TO </p><p>THEIR CAUSE.  CHIGWEDERE ADDED THAT THE MILITARY WOULD </p><p>NEVER SUPPORT TSVANGIRAI AS PRESIDENT SHOULD HE COME TO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  05352  01 OF 02  221133Z </p><p>POWER IN SOME KIND OF POPULAR REVOLUTION, BUT WAS MORE </p><p>VAGUE WHEN ASKED IF THE MILITARY WOULD SUPPORT A </p><p>LEGITIMATELY ELECTED TSVANGIRAI. </p><p> </p><p>NEW DEAL ON LAND? </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) ON THE LAND ISSUE, CHIGWEDERE REPORTED THAT THE </p><p>GOZ IS NEGOTIATING WITH THE COMMERCIAL FARMERS\' UNION </p><p>(CFU) THROUGH BACK CHANNELS TO OBTAIN SEVERAL HUNDRED </p><p>FARMS AND TO PAY FOR THEM THROUGH A TRUST FUND.  THE </p><p>DEPUTY MINISTER SAID THE GOVERNMENT IS ALSO IN TOUCH </p><p>WITH THE BRITISH ON THIS ISSUE, AND CLAIMED THEY SUPPORT </p><p>THE FACE-SAVING IDEA OF A DONOR-FUNDED TRUST FUND TO </p><p>BREAK THE LAND REFORM IMPASSE.  ZIMBABWE AND THE U.K. </p><p>HAVE BEEN SO AT ODDS OVER LAND REFORM THAT NEITHER IS </p><p>PUBLICLY WILLING TO SWALLOW THEIR PRIDE.  CHIGWEDERE </p><p>OFFERED THAT IT IS NOT GOVERNMENT POLICY TO EXPEL ALL </p><p>WHITE FARMERS FROM THEIR LAND--THE MOST PRODUCTIVE FARMS </p><p>IN MASHONALAND WOULD BE EXEMPTED.  ON THE OTHER HAND, IT </p><p>IS GOVERNMENT POLICY, HE STATED BLUNTLY, TO HARASS </p><p>FARMERS INTO SURRENDERING LARGE TRACTS OF LAND BORDERING </p><p>COMMUNAL AREAS BY PERMITTING COMMUNAL FARMERS TO CUT </p><p>DOWN TREES, STEAL WIRE, OR OCCUPY THE LAND OUTRIGHT. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ5849 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  05352  02 OF 02  221133Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DINT-00  DODE-00  DOTE-00 </p><p>      SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00   FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00 </p><p>      H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00 </p><p>      OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00 </p><p>      SP-00    IRM-00   SSO-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00 </p><p>      DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /006W </p><p>                  ------------------888844  221133Z /38 </p><p>O 221133Z SEP 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 7173 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY ADDIS ABABA </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 005352 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p>LONDON FOR CHARLES GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p>ADDIS ABABA FOR LUKASAVICH </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/22/05 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: ZANU-PF MODERATE WARNS OF CONSEQUENCES IF </p><p>ZIMBABWE DEMOCRACY ACT PASSES </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  05352  02 OF 02  221133Z </p><p>MUGABE SEEN AS LIABILITY IN ZANU-PF </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) CHIGWEDERE PROVIDED AN UNUSUALLY FRANK AND, IN </p><p>OUR JUDGMENT, ACCURATE DESCRIPTION OF THE CURRENT STATE </p><p>OF ZANU-PF POLITICS.  HE FLAT-OUT STATED THAT MUGABE HAS </p><p>BECOME A LIABILITY FOR THE PARTY, AND THE SOONER HE </p><p>RETIRES, THE BETTER.  IT WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR HIM </p><p>TO DO SO, HOWEVER, BECAUSE IT IS NOT IN THE AFRICAN </p><p>TRADITION FOR CHIEFS TO SIMPLY STEP ASIDE AND BECOME </p><p>"ORDINARY MEN."  ONLY GOD CAN RETIRE A CHIEF, CHIGWEDERE </p><p>ADDED.  HOWEVER, MUGABE HAS BEEN MISLED BY HIS CIRCLE OF </p><p>SYCOPHANTS, WHO, AS IN ANOTHER AFRICAN TRADITION, ONLY </p><p>WISH TO PLEASE THEIR CHIEF AND ARE LOATH TO SAY OR DO </p><p>ANYTHING THAT WOULD UPSET HIM.  THIS HAS LED TO AN IVORY </p><p>TOWER SYNDROME IN WHICH MUGABE DOES NOT FULLY UNDERSTAND </p><p>THE DEPTH OF DISCONTENT IN THE COUNTRY.  WHEN ASKED IF </p><p>THERE IS ANYONE WHO COULD SUCCEED MUGABE, THE DEPUTY </p><p>MINISTER SAID ONLY FINANCE MINISTER MAKONI WOULD COME </p><p>CLOSE TO FILLING HIS SHOES, AS MUGABE\'S INNER CIRCLE HAD </p><p>BEEN REJECTED BY THE PEOPLE IN THE JUNE 24-25 ELECTION. </p><p>MAKONI, HOWEVER, DOES NOT HAVE A BROAD BASE OF SUPPORT </p><p>SINCE MOST OF THE YOUNGER GENERATIONS HAVE NOT BEEN </p><p>PERMITTED TO ADVANCE IN THE PARTY.  HE DID NOT SEE ANY </p><p>GOOD PROSPECTS FOR YOUNG BLOOD TO FILTER UP THE PARTY </p><p>HIERARCHY SO LONG AS THE OLD GUARD REMAIN FIRMLY </p><p>ENTRENCHED. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) COMMENT: A COMMITTED AFRICANIST, CHIGWEDERE IS, </p><p>IN ZANU-PF TERMS, SOMEONE WE WOULD DESCRIBE AS A </p><p>MODERATE.  UNLIKE MOST OF MUGABE\'S CABINET, HE IS KNOWN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  05352  02 OF 02  221133Z </p><p>FOR TELLING IT LIKE IT IS, BUT HIS PREDICTION THAT A </p><p>MILITARY TAKEOVER IS IN THE WINGS IF THE ZDA PASSES IS </p><p>FARFETCHED.  HIS ARGUMENT CONTAINED FEW SPECIFICS, BUT </p><p>PROBABLY REFLECTS A GROWING REALIZATION IN ZANU-PF THAT </p><p>THE GOZ IS INCREASINGLY ISOLATED, BOTH AT HOME AND </p><p>ABROAD.  WHAT LITTLE POPULAR SUPPORT ZANU-PF\'S </p><p>LEADERSHIP HAS LEFT IS STEADILY ERODING, INSIDE AND </p><p>OUTSIDE THE PARTY.  CHIGWEDERE\'S APPEAL TO HALT PASSAGE </p><p>OF THE ZDA BASED ON AN IMMINENT MILITARY COUP TRUMPETS </p><p>ZANU-PF\'S GROWING DESPERATION.  IT IS VERY UNLIKELY THAT </p><p>PASSAGE OF THE ZDA WOULD HAVE ANY PRACTICAL EFFECT ON </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S ECONOMY, BUT IT COULD BECOME A CONVENIENT </p><p>SCAPEGOAT FOR THE GOZ\'S OWN GROSS MISMANAGEMENT OF THE </p><p>ECONOMY.  IT IS NOT INCONCEIVABLE THAT MUGABE WOULD </p><p>PREFER TO HAVE THE ACT BECOME LAW SO HE COULD ADD THE </p><p>U.S. TO HIS LONG LIST OF EXCUSES FOR HIS OWN </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S POOR PERFORMANCE.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>MCDONALD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
