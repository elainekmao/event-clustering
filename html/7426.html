Within </p><p>this framework, Turkey has already prepared a list of Arab </p><p>and Turkoman officials who should definitely take place in </p><p>the new Iraqi administration.  Weekend papers report that </p><p>Kurdish groups have started leaving Kirkuk and Mosul, but </p><p>Turkish troops remain on the highest alert to intervene if </p><p>necessary.  Meanwhile, 15 Turkish military officials went to </p><p>Northern Iraq to monitor developments in Mosul and Kirkuk. </p><p>"Sabah" covers the military delegation\'s report, saying that </p><p>`there have been no systematic attacks against the </p><p>Turkomen.\'  The majority of peshmerge militants have left </p><p>Kirkuk, but a few have remained to assist US troops until </p><p>the arrival of reinforcements.  "Radikal" reports that Syria </p><p>has become the new US target following the fall of Iraq. </p><p>The Bush administration accuses Syria of giving military </p><p>support to Saddam, providing shelter to fleeing Iraqi </p><p>officials, and hiding Iraqi weapons of mass destruction. </p><p>Today\'s "Turkiye" reports that the US is considering </p><p>launching a military operation against Syria.  Sunday\'s </p><p>"Hurriyet" reports that portraits of Saddam have been </p><p>removed from the walls of the Iraqi Embassy in Ankara. </p><p>"Yeni Safak" reports that during the first week of the </p><p>operation against Iraq, the US administration , in order to </p><p>change the war situation through diplomatic channels, sent a </p><p>delegation to Iraq led of Dick Cheney\'s daughter Elizabeth </p><p>Cheney.  Elizabeth Cheney, who works for the State </p><p>Department\'s Middle and Near East department, is also an </p><p>advisor to Israeli PM Ariel Saron, according to "Yeni </p><p>Safak." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EU:  "Radikal" reports that the Cyprus issue will be at the </p><p>top of the agenda of Turkey-EU relations this week.  Today </p><p>the EU will approve an updated Accession Partnership Accord </p><p>for Turkey.  FM Abdullah Gul will go to Luxembourg today to </p><p>participate at the EU Foreign Ministers meeting. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The cost of war to the U.S." </p><p>Cuneyt Ulsever opined in mass appeal Hurriyet (4/14): "The </p><p>war with Iraq has brought the U.S. some long-term costs. . </p><p>Unlike the Clinton-era understanding of the U.S. as a </p><p>`gracious imperial state,\' the U.S. has now become a state </p><p>that will mainly be viewed from a position of pure fear. </p><p>Coercion breeds coercion.  Unfortunately, terrorist acts </p><p>against the U.S. will increase henceforth, and without </p><p>receiving the sympathetic reaction the world displayed </p><p>against the September 11 attacks. .  Palestinian-inspired </p><p>terrorist acts will expand their area of legitimacy, and the </p><p>U.S. will feel, more than ever, obliged to solve the </p><p>Palestine problem.  The U.S. has shattered essential </p><p>organizational models such as the UN and NATO.  However, </p><p>America badly needs such organizations if globalization is </p><p>to gain legitimacy.  The U.S. will have to pay a high cost </p><p>for its ambition." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"After Saddam" </p><p>Yasemin Congar wrote in mass appeal Milliyet (4/14): "A day </p><p>before the collapse of the Baath regime in Baghdad, a U.S. </p><p>official said to reporters that a democratic Turkey should </p><p>be pleased with the change in Iraq.  `Turkey will have the </p><p>largest trade volume with the new Iraq. .  Turkey has got no </p><p>reason to be worried about the rights of the Kurds.  We want </p><p>the Kurds, as all other Iraqi ethnic groups, to get an equal </p><p>share from Iraq\'s national wealth.  If Turkey continues to </p><p>implement democratic and economic reforms, the Turkish </p><p>nation, and Kurdish-origin Turks, will live a more </p><p>prosperous life.  There will be no reason for Ankara to </p><p>worry that Iraqi Kurds will act as a model in the region,\' </p><p>he said. .  In a briefing for Arab and Muslim journalists, </p><p>Deputy Secretary of Defense Wolfowitz said that Turkey\'s </p><p>concern regarding Northern Iraq is legitimate, for </p><p>terrorists who found shelter in the region have killed </p><p>thousands in the 1990s.  He noted that not only the U.S., </p><p>but the KDP and PUK have also helped `a great deal\' in </p><p>Turkey\'s fight against the PKK.  Wolfowitz stressed that </p><p>both the Kurds and Turkomen have been targeted in Saddam\'s </p><p>ethnic cleansing operations.  He reminded that Arabs were </p><p>settled in place of displaced ethnic groups, and claimed </p><p>they would be allowed to return home through a `systematic </p><p>legal process\' instead of by `brute force.\' .  How does </p><p>Ankara regard Wolfowitz\'s assertion?  Is it possible for </p><p>Turkey to establish a relationship of trust with the KDP and </p><p>PUK in a new Iraq? .  How many in Ankara believe that </p><p>removal of Saddam will be the beginning of a much better </p><p>future for Iraq and Turkey?" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Who is threatening world peace?" </p><p>Semih Idiz commented in mass appeal Aksam (4/14): "Allowing </p><p>the destruction of the National Museum in Baghdad, which </p><p>stood witness to Mesopotamia\'s five thousand years of </p><p>history, will be remembered as a crime against humanity by </p><p>the U.S.  Washington had planned measures for the protection </p><p>of oil wells months before the operation, but did nothing to </p><p>protect the museum. .  It\'s gradually becoming clear that </p><p>this war has got nothing to do with the welfare of the Iraqi </p><p>nation.  It is now understood that it is related with the </p><p>`black gold\' and Israel, a country essential for America\'s </p><p>regional interests.  The evidence for the latter is seen in </p><p>U.S. statements that Syria might be next because of its </p><p>support for Hizbullah, the enemy of Israel.  It seems that </p><p>the Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz, Perle `cabal\' has developed an </p><p>extremely dangerous master plan.  Those who claim that Bush, </p><p>not Saddam was a threat to world peace are right." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
