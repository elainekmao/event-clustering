<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ADANA 0108 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINS, PGOV, PHUM, TU, IZ, ADANA, Press Summaries </p><p>SUBJECT:  SOUTHEAST TURKEY PRESS SUMMARY, </p><p>          APRIL 15, 2003 </p><p> </p><p>1.  This is the Southeastern Turkey press summary </p><p>for April 15, 2003.  Please note that Turkish </p><p>press reports often contain errors or </p><p>exaggerations; AmConsulate Adana does not vouch </p><p>for the accuracy of the reports summarized here. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>POLITICAL, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  Milli Gazete/Bolge: Incirlik AFB became </p><p>active once more yesterday noon as five C-130s </p><p>took off and another one landed at the base. It </p><p>is reported that the cargo planes carried </p><p>military equipment brought to the AFB from other </p><p>US bases in the southeast and Iskenderun port. </p><p>Bolge reports the "Maersk Rostock" freighter </p><p>discharged 10 containers of US humanitarian </p><p>relief to be forwarded to Iraq via southeastern </p><p>Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  Cumhuriyet: Goc-Der, The Immigrants Social </p><p>Assistance and Cultural Association has launched </p><p>a campaign to end the village guard system, which </p><p>is perceived as the most important impediment for </p><p>return to the villages. Many people moved to </p><p>urban centers because of the terror that started </p><p>in the southeast in 1984. While GOT officials </p><p>have stated that some 375,000 people left from </p><p>some 3,000 southeastern villages and hamlets, </p><p>some NGOs have estimated much higher, citing </p><p>millions of internally displaced people. With the </p><p>support of NGOs and municipalities, Goc-Der is </p><p>going to prepare a "Migration Map" of Turkey. The </p><p>project aims primarily to determine: the exact </p><p>number of migrants stemming from the 15-year-long </p><p>clash; how many of them managed to return; what </p><p>are their living conditions; and what is the </p><p>status of uncultivated land.  At Goc-Der\'s </p><p>initiative, petitions with 18,000 signatures </p><p>demanding return to the villages were submitted </p><p>to the Turkish parliament. According to the </p><p>parliament\'s Human Rights Commission report of </p><p>April 2003, a total of 58,513 persons from 10,511 </p><p>families have been returned to 456 villages and </p><p>347 hamlets. Clashes between village guards who </p><p>have been settled in the evicted villages and the </p><p>returnees have been reported, and thus Goc-Der </p><p>portrays the village guard system as the main </p><p>obstacle. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  Turkiye: Acting on a tip, Van Security </p><p>Directorate teams seized over 20 kilos of </p><p>Iranian-origin heroin in the secret compartments </p><p>of a private car. Two persons arrested in </p><p>connection with trafficking of the drugs were </p><p>ordered held by the court. The police searching </p><p>the houses of the suspects and there seized one </p><p>unlicensed pistol and EU 10,600. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  Turkiye: Jandarma teams, acting with a search </p><p>warrant issued by Adana State Security Court, </p><p>seized 37 illegal publications, books, magazines, </p><p>and documents at Ramazan Elcin\'s house in Gecitli </p><p>district and Mehmet Sefik Arslan\'s house in Misis </p><p>district of Yuregir township. An investigation </p><p>has started, the officials said. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  Hurriyet: An independent parliamentary deputy </p><p>from Hakkari, Mustafa Zeydan, joined ANAP. With </p><p>his transfer, ANAP will henceforth be represented </p><p>in the Turkish parliament. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ECONOMIC AND CULTURAL DEVELOPMENTS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  Turkiye: It is reported by the Gaziantep- </p><p>based Southeast Anatolian Exporters Union that </p><p>there has been a more than five percent increase </p><p>in pine nut exports in the first three months of </p><p>the year. The Exporters Union also announced </p><p>similar increases in nuts, red lentils, </p><p>chickpeas, and in wheat flour. More dramatic was </p><p>the decrease in exports of pistachios, sugar, </p><p>electric-electronic items, oil seeds, cement, and </p><p>livestock. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  Hurriyet: As oil tankers could not come to </p><p>Yumurtalik because of the war in Iraq, the </p><p>Turkish Ministry of Energy asked to halt pumping </p><p>of oil last week because the pipes were already </p><p>full. Between 5 to 5.5 thousand cubic meters of </p><p>oil had been pumped daily from the lines, but no </p><p>oil tankers were able to ship the oil from the </p><p>storage in Yumurtalik to the international </p><p>markets. </p><p>HOLTZ </p><p></p></div>
