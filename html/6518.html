(SBU) Queen Alia International Airport Director Nasri </p><p>Nowar told us that while the airport remains open, most </p><p>international carriers have suspended or are about to suspend </p><p>service.  These include KLM, Air France, Lufthansa, Alitalia, </p><p>and British Airways.  He said that national carrier Royal </p><p>Jordanian Airlines (RJ) and regional carriers Gulf Air, </p><p>Emirates, and others continue to operate.  The airport is on </p><p>what Nowar called "high security alert status."  In the event </p><p>of hostilities, Nowar said he expected to keep the airport </p><p>open.  He said that he has worked with a number of </p><p>humanitarian agencies to coordinate arrangements for use of </p><p>the airport for humanitarian purposes. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) RJ officials told us the airline had canceled its </p><p>Thursday and Friday UN-approved charter flights to Baghdad. </p><p>Otherwise, the airline hopes to continue to operate normally </p><p>for as long as possible and as long as insurance is </p><p>available.  This includes RJ\'s direct service to JFK, </p><p>Chicago, and Detroit.  If operations out of Amman become </p><p>impossible, RJ will transfer its hub to Athens, with regular </p><p>shuttle flights to Amman.  Nowar added that a number of </p><p>Iraqis, denied entry into Jordan in accordance with current </p><p>GOJ policy, were expected to be returned to Baghdad via an </p><p>unscheduled RJ flight today, Wednesday, March 19. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
