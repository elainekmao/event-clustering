<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 HARARE 000648 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR J. FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR C. GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR C. NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR T. PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/01/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PINR, ASEC, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MDC WINS HIGHFIELD AND KUWADZANA </p><p> </p><p>REF: HARARE 636 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Officer Audu Besmer for reasons 1.5 b/d </p><p> </p><p>Summary: </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) The opposition MDC won by-elections in the Harare </p><p>high-density suburbs of Highfield and Kuwadzana by </p><p>significant margins, despite an electoral process tilted </p><p>heavily in favor of ZANU-PF.  The March 29-30 voting process </p><p>itself was peaceful and orderly, if at times slow.  The </p><p>environment in the vicinity of many polling stations, </p><p>however, was very tense as roving bands of ZANU-PF youths and </p><p>supporters threatened and harassed voters and diplomatic </p><p>observers.  We would expect the GOZ to claim victory a </p><p>Pyrrhic in that it increased the percentage of its urban </p><p>support, and to respond with a violent crackdown on MDC </p><p>supporters in the two constituencies.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) According to state radio, MDC officials and the </p><p>Director of the Zimbabwe Election Support Network (ZESN), a </p><p>coalition of NGOs interested in maintaining the integrity of </p><p>elections, the MDC won Highfield with 8,759 votes, against </p><p>only 4,844 for ZANU-PF.  In Kuwadzana, the MDC received </p><p>12,548 votes to ZANU-PF\'s 5,002.  These numbers represent a </p><p>fifty percent increase in votes cast for ZANU-PF in </p><p>Highfield, and a eleven percent increase in votes cast for </p><p>ZANU-PF in Kuwadzana since the 2000 parliamentary elections. </p><p>In contrast, these numbers represent a forty percent decrease </p><p>in votes cast for the MDC in Highfield, and a twenty percent </p><p>decrease in votes cast for the MDC in Kuwadzana as compared </p><p>to the 2000 parliamentary elections.  The MDC\'s victories </p><p>were announced on government-controlled radio broadcasts late </p><p>in the day on March 31. </p><p> </p><p>Diplomatic Access to Polling Stations Problematic </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Six Emboffs along with about twenty diplomats from </p><p>other Western and African countries observed voting in </p><p>by-elections in the Harare high-density suburbs of Kuwadzana </p><p>and Highfield March 29-30.  Even though interested foreign </p><p>missions in Harare had received and were carrying letters </p><p>from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs indicating that </p><p>accreditation for diplomats was not necessary, some polling </p><p>station officials denied some diplomats access on March 29. </p><p>The government-appointed Electoral Supervisory Commission </p><p>issued a letter to polling station presiding officers by </p><p>March 30 and diplomats then gained full access.  Emboffs </p><p>observed that voting proceeded peacefully and in good order, </p><p>if at times slowly.  Emboffs observed lines of 100-350 </p><p>prospective voters at most of the nineteen polling stations </p><p>on March 29, but, consistent with expectations, lines of only </p><p>10-20 voters on March 30.  The historical pattern in </p><p>Zimbabwean elections is that most people vote on the first </p><p>day.  By the afternoon of March 30 a few polling stations had </p><p>logged about 1600 total votes each.  Emboffs observed and </p><p>party polling agents confirmed less than ten percent of </p><p>prospective voters were turned away. </p><p> </p><p>Violence </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) There were more incidents of violence than is typical </p><p>on the voting days, which historically have been peaceful. </p><p>According to a representative of the prominent human rights </p><p>organization, the Amani Trust, the Avenues Medical Clinic </p><p>treated ten people on March 30 for beating wounds reportedly </p><p>inflicted by ruling party supporters in Kuwadzana and </p><p>Highfield.  In one case, ZANU-PF youths beat an MDC member </p><p>assigned to bring food to MDC polling agents, who by law </p><p>cannot leave their polling stations.  The MDC member suffered </p><p>a large head wound and bruises over his entire body when </p><p>Poloff saw him at the Avenues Medical Clinic on March 30. </p><p>According to another MDC member assigned with the victim to </p><p>deliver food, ZANU-PF supporters chased the MDC members, </p><p>including a Highfield MDC polling agent.  They drove to the </p><p>Highfield police station seeking protection but police were </p><p>unresponsive.  Later, the youths blocked the car in which the </p><p>MDC members were traveling.  Others escaped on foot, but the </p><p>youths beat the victim severely. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) On March 29 in Highfield, Emboff observed ZANU-PF </p><p>youths beating one man while other ZANU-PF youths were </p><p>handing out bread from the back of a flatbed truck. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) ZESN reported that on March 30 ZANU-PF supporters </p><p>abducted two of their independent observers from polling </p><p>stations in Kuwadzana and beat them severely.  Another was </p><p>beaten at a polling station in Highfield. </p><p> </p><p>Intimidation </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Emboffs observed ZANU-PF youths, possibly National </p><p>Youth Service members in plain clothes, roving around polling </p><p>stations in the two constituencies on foot and in large flat </p><p>bed trucks and small pickups.  These youths threatened voters </p><p>and Emboffs verbally at the entrances to many polling </p><p>stations, and Emboffs observed large numbers of voters </p><p>leaving voting lines without having voted.  Riot police were </p><p>heavily deployed in both constituencies in large </p><p>military-style vehicles, but they did little to control </p><p>illegal campaigning by ZANU-PF youths. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) On March 29, at a supermarket shopping plaza near a </p><p>Kuwadzana polling station ZANU-PF supporters were drumming </p><p>and chanting "don\'t vote, go home or we will attack you" </p><p>while, ironically, holding a campaign banner for the ZANU-PF </p><p>candidate--in clear violation of Zimbabwe\'s electoral laws. </p><p>The Deputy South African High Commissioner attempted to </p><p>reason with the mob, but they surrounded him and shouted at </p><p>him to "go back to South Africa." </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) In an encounter on March 29 in Highfield, the ZANU-PF </p><p>candidate, Joseph Chinotimba accused Emboffs of being </p><p>terrorists and said they had no right to be at the polling </p><p>station. </p><p> </p><p>Irregularities and Electoral Law Violations </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) On March 29-30 diplomats saw Elliott Manyika, </p><p>ZANU-PF\'s National Political Commissar and Cabinet Minister, </p><p>visiting polling stations throughout both constituencies.  On </p><p>March 30 he addressed a ZANU-PF rally near the Kuwadzana </p><p>District Office polling station --clearly illegal under </p><p>Zimbabwean election law and certainly intimidating to MDC </p><p>voters standing in line--encouraging support for the ruling </p><p>party. </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) On March 29 and 30 diplomats saw a police officer in </p><p>one case, and ZANU-PF officials in other cases, checking </p><p>names off some sort of registry as people approached and </p><p>"checked in" at tables set up near polling stations in </p><p>Highfield.  The registrants were then ferried to nearby </p><p>polling stations in pickup trucks to vote.  The diplomats </p><p>questioned the officials involved and confirmed that they </p><p>were members of ZANU-PF.  The officials warned the diplomats </p><p>to leave.  We presume that the registry was for ruling party </p><p>voters who had cast ballots for the ZANU-PF candidate or </p><p>intended to do so, and would comprise the beneficiary list </p><p>for rewards such as scarce mealie meal. </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) At one polling station in Highfield on March 29, </p><p>Emboffs observed ZANU-PF youths entering and exiting without </p><p>the required official identification badges.  The MDC polling </p><p>agent there reported that they had harassed him and had </p><p>broken his vehicle windshield while the polling agent was </p><p>inside the polling station. </p><p> </p><p>Comment: </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) ZANU-PF employed its usual tactics of violence and </p><p>intimidation and flaunted electoral and other laws willy </p><p>nilly in the process.  The significant decrease in the number </p><p>of votes cast for the MDC, in the face of widespread popular </p><p>dissatisfaction with this regime, is a testament to the </p><p>effectiveness of the GOZ intimidation machine.  Having been </p><p>thrashed at the polls, we still expect the GOZ to claim </p><p>victories in having increased its share of the votes cast in </p><p>both constituencies.  And while 200 people spontaneously </p><p>celebrated on the street in front of MDC\'s headquarters in </p><p>downtown Harare when the results were announced on March 31, </p><p>we would expect this jovial mood to give way very shortly to </p><p>fear in the face of government retribution against MDC </p><p>supporters in these two steadfast opposition constituencies. </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) Comment continued.  Cheating in an urban environment </p><p>is more difficult, but how ZANU-PF let these elections slip </p><p>away remains unanswered.  It is possible / probable that some </p><p>phantom ballots were cast for ZANU-PF, but clearly not </p><p>enough.  Prior to the elections, the MDC claimed voter roll </p><p>rigging of 11,000 in Highfield and 8,000 in Kuwadzana, nearly </p><p>equal to the total votes the MDC received.  ZANU-PF clearly </p><p>did not pull out all the stops, and as a result the magic </p><p>number of parliamentary seats they must obtain to reach the </p><p>absolute two-thirds majority they seek remains at this time, </p><p>still tantalizingly out of reach.  End Comment. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
