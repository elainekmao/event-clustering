(C) SUMMARY: ZIMBABWEAN JUSTICE MINISTER AND </p><p>MUGABE CONFIDANT STATES THAT THE VICTORIA FALLS </p><p>MEETING WAS CALLED IN ORDER TO REMOVE ANY OBSTACLES </p><p>TO CONTINUED FORWARD PROGRESS THAT MIGHT HAVE </p><p>RESULTED FROM CEASE-FIRE VIOLATIONS SINCE THE RECENT </p><p>KAMPALA AGREEMENT.  ZIMBABWE AND NAMIBIA, HE ASSERTS, </p><p>ARE PARTICULARLY EAGER TO FIND A QUICK EXIT FROM THE </p><p>DRC, BUT CAN DO SO ONLY IF IT IS CLEAR THAT UGANDA </p><p>AND RWANDA ARE ALSO WITHDRAWING.  HE REPORTS THAT, </p><p>AFTER BEING APPROACHED BY RWANDA AND UGANDA, ZIMBABWE </p><p>HAD INITIATED CONVERSATIONS WITH THE EX- </p><p>FAR/INTERAHAMWE ABOUT THEIR RESETTLEMENT IN THE </p><p>INTERIOR OF THE DRC.

ZIMBABWE FEELS IT IS IMPORTANT TO AVOID </p><p>A RUPTURE WITH KABILA, AND BELIEVES THAT DDRR ISSUES </p><p>WILL BE EASIER TO ADDRESS ONCE MONUC IS DEPLOYED ON </p><p>THE GROUND AND IF THERE IS BROADER INTERNATIONAL </p><p>ENGAGEMENT.  HE ARGUES THAT THESE ISSUES ARE MORE </p><p>EASILY PRESSED BY THIRD PARTIES, AND URGES THAT THE </p><p>USG INTENSIFY ITS SHUTTLE DIPLOMACY, PARTICULARLY </p><p>BETWEEN KINSHASA AND HARARE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>BACKGROUND OF THE VIC FALLS MEETING </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) : ON APRIL 21 S/E WOLPE, AMBASSADOR MCDONALD, </p><p>LT. COL. GADDIS AND ECONOFF NOTETAKER MET WITH </p><p>EMERSON MNANGAGWA, MINISTER OF JUSTICE, LEGAL AND </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS AND A CLOSE CONFIDANT OF </p><p>PRESIDENT MUGABE, TO DISCUSS RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN </p><p>THE CONGO AND THE EXECUTION OF THE LUSAKA PEACE </p><p>ACCORD.  IN A NEARLY 90 MINUTE-LONG MEETING, THE </p><p>JUSTICE MINISTER COVERED CONSIDERABLE GROUND, AND </p><p>OFFERED PARTICULARLY CANDID OBSERVATIONS ABOUT THE </p><p>EX-FAR/INTERAHAMWE AND ZIMBABWE\'S RELATIONSHIP WITH </p><p>KABILA. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) MNANGAGWA SAID THAT ZIMBABWE HAD BECOME VERY </p><p>ANXIOUS ABOUT THE INCIDENTS THAT HAD OCCURRED ON THE </p><p>GROUND SINCE THE KAMPALA CEASE-FIRE/DISENGAGEMENT </p><p>AGREEMENT.  THE VARIOUS PERSONNEL MOVEMENTS AND </p><p>CEASE-FIRE VIOLATIONS HAD RAISED QUESTIONS ABOUT THE </p><p>COMMITMENT BY THOSE INVOLVED, AND THERE WERE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02198  01 OF 05  212004Z </p><p>SUSPICIONS THAT SOME SIDES STILL SOUGHT MILITARY </p><p>GAINS.  ZIMBABWE FEARED THAT EVENTS MIGHT BE SPINNING </p><p>OUT OF CONTROL. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) MNANGAGWA SAID THAT IT WAS MUSEVENI WHO HAD </p><p>SUGGESTED THE VICTORIA FALLS MEETING, AND WHO HAD </p><p>UNDERTAKEN TO DELIVER KAGAME.  MUGABE AND NUJOMA HAD </p><p>PROMISED TO DELIVER DOS SANTOS, WITH KABILA ALSO </p><p>INVITED.  THE IDEA WAS TO HAVE "AN INFORMAL, NON- </p><p>BINDING SETTING" IN WHICH THE LEADERS MIGHT REMOVE </p><p>ANY OBSTACLES THAT HAD EMERGED AS A RESULT OF THE </p><p>INCIDENTS THAT HAD OCCURRED OVER THE PAST THREE TO </p><p>FOUR WEEKS.  THE ZIMBABWEANS INTENDED TO PRESS FOR A </p><p>RENEWED SENSE OF COMMITMENT TO DISENGAGEMENT AT THE </p><p>HIGHEST LEVEL; TO DETERMINE HOW MUCH THE TWO SIDES </p><p>COULD "VOLUNTARILY MOVE BACKWARD" IN THE SPIRIT OF </p><p>COMMITMENT TO THE LUSAKA AGREEMENT; AND TO FIND A </p><p>METHOD OF INSURING THAT AGREEMENTS MADE WERE HONORED. </p><p>IF THE LEADERS "SEE LIGHT," THEY WILL THEN BRIEF </p><p>CHILUBA.  MNANGAGWA ADDED THAT ZIMBABWE AND NAMIBIA </p><p>WERE PARTICULARLY ANXIOUS FOR A PULLBACK.  (ANGOLA, </p><p>HE SAID, HAD VIRTUALLY NO TROOPS ON THE GROUND AND </p><p>WAS NO LONGER A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR.)

(C) ACCORDING TO THE JUSTICE MINISTER, MBEKI AND </p><p>CHISSANO WERE COMING TO VIC FALLS FOR A DIFFERENT </p><p>REASON: TO DISCUSS ZIMBABWE\'S LAND QUESTION.  MBEKI, </p><p>HE SAID, HAD SPECIFICALLY REQUESTED THAT HE NOT BE </p><p>INVOLVED IN THE INFORMAL CONGO DISCUSSIONS. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>WHAT TO DO WITH NON-STATE ACTORS </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) AFTER PRAISING ZIMBABWE\'S LEADERSHIP IN </p><p>SECURING THE RECENT KAMPALA AGREEMENTS, AND ASSURING </p><p>THE JUSTICE MINISTER THAT THE USG WOULD CONTINUE TO </p><p>INSIST ON THE FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF LUSAKA AND THE </p><p>FULL RESTORATION OF CONGOLESE SOVEREIGNTY AND </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02198  02 OF 05  212004Z </p><p>TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY, S/E WOLPE BROACHED THE KNOTTY </p><p>PROBLEM OF DISARMAMENT AND RESETTLEMENT OF THE NON- </p><p>STATE ACTORS.  HE ASKED THE JUSTICE MINISTER IF IT </p><p>MIGHT BE POSSIBLE TO ACCELERATE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF </p><p>LUSAKA BY BOLD MOVES ON BOTH SIDES: A DEEPER </p><p>DISENGAGEMENT AND PARTIAL WITHDRAWAL BY RWANDA AND </p><p>UGANDA, LINKED TO UNDERTAKINGS BY THE GDRC AND ITS </p><p>ALLIES WITH RESPECT TO THE DISARMAMENT AND </p><p>DEMOBILIZATION OF NON-SIGNATORY FORCES.  WHAT DID </p><p>ZIMBABWE FEEL IT COULD DO THAT MIGHT ENCOURAGE RWANDA </p><p>AND UGANDA TO BE MORE FORTHCOMING? </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) MNANGAGWA RESPONDED FRANKLY THAT THE GOZ HAD </p><p>NOT YET DEVELOPED CONCRETE POSITIONS ON DDRR, BUT </p><p>ZIMBABWE DID RECOGNIZE THIS WAS THE CRUCIAL QUESTION. </p><p>HE SAID THAT TWO MONTHS AGO, AFTER BEING QUIETLY </p><p>APPROACHED BY RWANDA AND UGANDA, ZIMBABWE GAVE THE </p><p>GREEN LIGHT TO ZIMBABWE MILITARY INTELLIGENCE TO SEE </p><p>WHAT COULD BE DONE.  HE HIMSELF HAD SPOKEN WITH THE </p><p>EX-FAR/INTERAHAMWE.  HE DISCOVERED THAT THE LARGEST </p><p>PART OF THEM WANTED TO SETTLE IN THE DRC.  THE </p><p>ZIMBABWEANS THEN ASKED THE HUTU FIGHTERS IF THEY </p><p>WOULD BE PREPARED TO ACCEPT DISARMAMENT.  IN THE </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN VIEW, A SOLUTION WAS IN SIGHT: IF THE EX- </p><p>FAR/INTERAHAMWE ELEMENTS WERE TO SETTLE IN THE DRC, </p><p>THEY WOULD NOT/NOT BE ON THE BORDER BUT IN THE </p><p>INTERIOR; THEREFORE, THEY WOULD NO LONGER POSE A </p><p>THREAT TO RWANDA OR BURUNDI. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) HOWEVER, THE JUSTICE MINISTER CONTINUED, THE </p><p>DRC LEARNED OF THE ZIMBABWEAN INITIATIVE AND KABILA </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02198  02 OF 05  212004Z </p><p>HAD REACTED VERY NEGATIVELY.  THE ZIMBABWEANS HAD </p><p>THEREFORE TURNED OFF THIS ATTEMPT AT FINDING A </p><p>SOLUTION TO THE EX-FAR/INTERAHAMWE PROBLEM.  THE </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN IMMEDIATE GOAL, HE SAID, WAS "TO MAXIMIZE </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN INFLUENCE ON KABILA, RATHER THAN ON THESE </p><p>FORCES."  "WE NEED TO PLAY A ROLE THAT IS APPRECIATED </p><p>BY KABILA," HE SAID, "SO WE CAN PUSH HIM TO TAKE </p><p>POSITIONS THAT WOULD BE ACCEPTABLE TO THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY."  ZIMBABWE HAD CONCLUDED </p><p>THAT, GIVEN KABILA\'S OPPOSITION TO ANY SUCH </p><p>DISCUSSION, PUSHING THE EX-FAR/INTERAHAMWE ISSUE AT </p><p>THIS POINT WOULD BE VERY COSTLY IN TERMS OF THE </p><p>BIGGER PICTURE.  (IN AN ASIDE, THE JUSTICE MINISTER </p><p>OBLIQUELY REFERENCED SOME DISCUSSIONS THE DRC HAD HAD </p><p>WITH THE EX-FAR/INTERAHAMWE ABOUT HOW THEIR DEMANDS </p><p>COULD BE ADDRESSED.  HOWEVER, HE DOUBTED THERE HAD </p><p>BEEN ANY DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN THESE ELEMENTS AND </p><p>EITHER UGANDA OR RWANDA.) </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) MNANGAGWA AGREED THAT THE DISARMAMENT </p><p>RESOLUTION HAD TO BE RESOLVED IF LUSAKA WERE TO BE </p><p>FULLY IMPLEMENTED.  BUT, HE SAID, ZIMBABWE COULD NOT </p><p>BE IN THE LEAD OR SEEN AS THE CHAMPION OF THIS </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ3113 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  02198  03 OF 05  212004Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    ACQ-00   CIAE-00  SMEC-00  DINT-00  DODE-00 </p><p>      DOEE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-01   OIGO-02 </p><p>      FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-01    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00 </p><p>      L-00     AC-01    NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00 </p><p>      PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    TRSE-00  USIE-00 </p><p>      PMB-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00 </p><p>        /012W </p><p>                  ------------------4EC120  212008Z /38 </p><p>P 211945Z APR 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 5811 </p><p>INFO USMISSION USUN NEW YORK PRIORITY </p><p>NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY KAMPALA </p><p>AMEMBASSY KINSHASA </p><p>AMEMBASSY PRETORIA </p><p>AMEMBASSY LUANDA </p><p>AMEMBASSY LUSAKA </p><p>AMEMBASSY MAPUTO </p><p>AMEMBASSY WINDHOEK </p><p>AMEMBASSY KIGALI </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p>AMEMBASSY LONDON </p><p>AMEMBASSY PARIS </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 05 HARARE 002198 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  02198  03 OF 05  212004Z </p><p>STATE FOR AF A/S SUSAN RICE, DAS POWELL, AF/S, AF/E, </p><p>USUN FOR AMBASSADOR HOLBROOKE AND SODERBERG, </p><p>USUN/W/BOBORR </p><p>STATE PASS DOD FOR OSD/PKHA/JSCHEAR </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p>LONDON FOR PFLAUMER </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/21/10 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PINR, CG, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: S/E WOLPE DISCUSSES DISENGAGEMENT AND </p><p>DISARMAMENT WITH MUGABE CONFIDANT </p><p> </p><p>INITIATIVE.  RATHER, ZIMBABWE WANTED TO SEE MORE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL PLAYERS INVOLVED.  ONCE MONUC DEPLOYED, </p><p>ZIMBABWE WOULD BE LESS SIGNIFICANT AND LESS VISIBLE, </p><p>AND IT WOULD BE EASIER TO WORK THE DDRR ISSUES.  IT </p><p>WOULD ALSO BE EASIER TO ADDRESS THE DIFFICULT DDRR </p><p>ISSUES IF THEY WERE PRESSED BY THIRD PARTIES, HE </p><p>SAID. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) WOLPE OBSERVED, WITH THE JUSTICE MINISTER\'S </p><p>CONCURRENCE, THAT KABILA DID IN FACT APPEAR TO </p><p>RESPOND TO STRONG PRESSURE.  WHY, THEN, WAS ZIMBABWE </p><p>RELUCTANT TO EXERT THE SAME PRESSURE ON KABILA ON THE </p><p>DISARMAMENT ISSUE THAT IT HAD BROUGHT TO BEAR IN </p><p>CONNECTION WITH THE KAMPALA CEASE-FIRE AGREEMENT? </p><p>MNANGAGWA RESPONDED THAT THIS WAS A CORE ISSUE FOR </p><p>KABILA, AND ZIMBABWEANS FEARED THE CONSEQUENCES IF </p><p>THEY PUSHED KABILA TOO FAR.  KABILA WAS ALREADY </p><p>SHOPPING AROUND FOR OTHERS TO FILL THE ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02198  03 OF 05  212004Z </p><p>ROLE, AND THAT HAD MADE THE GOZ EVEN MORE CAUTIOUS. </p><p>WOLPE NOTED THAT ALL OF THE EQUIPMENT KABILA HAD </p><p>PURCHASED HAD DONE LITTLE TO IMPROVE KABILA\'S </p><p>POSITION, AND THAT HE REMAINED DEPENDENT 0N THE </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN ARMY.  MNANGAGWA SAID THAT, WHILE THIS </p><p>MIGHT BE TRUE, KABILA COULD PROVIDE MORE SIGNIFICANT </p><p>ARMS TO THE NON-SIGNATORY FORCES, AND CREATE HAVOC </p><p>FOR THE CONGO AND THE REGION.  KABILA, HE SAID, HAD </p><p>EARLIER PROVIDED SOME ARMS TO THE EX-FAR/INTERAHAMWE, </p><p>BUT THIS ARMS SUPPLY HAD BEEN LIMITED THANKS TO </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN INTERVENTION. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>HOW ABOUT RESUPPLY AND TRAINING? </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) WOLPE ASKED IF ZIMBABWE AND THE ALLIES MIGHT </p><p>BE ABLE, IN EXCHANGE FOR A DISENGAGEMENT INITIATIVE </p><p>BY RWANDA AND UGANDA, TO AT LEAST INSURE THE </p><p>CESSATION OF TRAINING AND RESUPPLY OF THE NON- </p><p>SIGNATORY FORCES.  MNANGAGWA INITIALLY RESPONDED THAT </p><p>THIS WOULD BE DIFFICULT FOR THE ALLIES TO MANAGE, AND </p><p>THAT ZIMBABWE HOPED THAT CHILUBA AND MASIRE COULD </p><p>ASSIST THE PARTIES "IN TALKING ACROSS THE LINES." </p><p>SUBSEQUENTLY, HOWEVER, MNANGAGWA SAID THAT HE </p><p>BELIEVED A COMMITMENT TO TERMINATE TRAINING AND </p><p>RESUPPLY COULD IN FACT BE MADE BY THE ALLIES TO </p><p>UGANDA AND RWANDA. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>MASIRE AND THE NATIONAL DIALOGUE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02198  03 OF 05  212004Z </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) WOLPE TURNED TO THE QUESTION OF MASIRE AND </p><p>THE INTER-CONGOLESE DIALOGUE, DESCRIBING THE EFFORTS </p><p>THE USG HAD BEEN MAKING TO GET KABILA TO UNDERSTAND </p><p>THAT HE COULD EMERGE IN A STRONGER POSITION BY FULLY </p><p>EMBRACING LUSAKA AND ACCEPTING MASIRE\'S FACILITATION. </p><p>MNANGAGWA AGREED WITH WOLPE, AND SAID THAT ZIMBABWE </p><p>HAD MADE THE SAME POINT WITH THE CONGOLESE PRESIDENT. </p><p>HE SAID IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT THAT MASIRE ESTABLISH A </p><p>MORE PUBLIC PROFILE, AND THAT HE BE SEEN TO BE </p><p>ACTIVELY CONSULTING WITH ALL OF THE REGIONAL </p><p>CAPITALS. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE? </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C) WHEN ASKED BY S/E WOLPE WHAT MESSAGE HE </p><p>COULD CARRY FROM HARARE TO RWANDA AND UGANDA, THE </p><p>JUSTICE MINISTER REPLIED: "THAT ZIMBABWE IS ANXIOUS </p><p>TO SEE A CONCLUSION TO THIS WAR."  MNANGAGWA OBSERVED </p><p>THAT RWANDA AND UGANDA WOULD NO DOUBT SAY THE SAME </p><p>THING.

HOWEVER, KABILA REJECTED </p><p>THE APPLICATION OF THIS RESTRICTION TO THE </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL GUARD, WHICH IS PRESENTLY DEPLOYED IN </p><p>THREE PROVINCES; KINSHASA, ORIENTALE AND KATANGA. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>MORE USG SHUTTLE DIPLOMACY IS NEEDED </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>17.

HOWEVER, ONCE THE DECISION WAS TAKEN, THERE </p><p>COULD BE AN EXPLOSION OF HIGH-LEVEL CONTACT AND </p><p>COMMUNICATION.  THIS WAS NOT A REAL PROBLEM. </p><p>HOWEVER, WHAT WOULD HELP NOW IS IF THE USG WOULD </p><p>ENGAGE IN MUCH MORE FREQUENT SHUTTLING BETWEEN THE </p><p>CAPITALS OF KINSHASA AND HARARE, BETWEEN KABILA AND </p><p>MUGABE.. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>18.  (C) THE REMARKABLE CANDOR OF THE JUSTICE </p><p>MINISTER -- NOTING THE CENTRAL IMPORTANCE TO LUSAKA </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION OF DDRR; ACKNOWLEDGING HIS OWN </p><p>DISCUSSIONS WITH, AND REFLECTIONS ABOUT, THE EX- </p><p>FAR/INTERHAMWE; AND DESCRIBING ZIMBABWE\'S DIFFICULT </p><p>RELATIONSHIP WITH KABILA -- IS TESTIMONY TO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02198  05 OF 05  212004Z </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S URGENT NEED TO FIND A QUICK WAY OUT OF THE </p><p>DROC.  KABILA\'S REJECTION OF ANY SUBSTANTIVE </p><p>DISCUSSION ON DDRR REMAINS A MAJOR HURDLE TO LUSAKA </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION.  IN THE VIEW OF MNANGAGWA, THIS COULD </p><p>BEST BE ADDRESSED THROUGH BROADER INTERNATIONAL </p><p>ENGAGEMENT ON THIS ISSUE.  THE ELEMENTS OF AN INITIAL </p><p>DEAL COULD BE IN THE MAKING, THOUGH, IF THE </p><p>ZIMBABWEANS WOULD BE WILLING AT SOME POINT TO COMMIT </p><p>JOINTLY WITH THEIR ALLIES TO TERMINATE TRAINING AND </p><p>RESUPPLY OF THE EX-FAR/INTERAHAMWE. </p><p> </p><p>19.

IT WOULD APPEAR </p><p>ALSO THAT ZIMBABWE\'S COMFORT LEVEL WITH SOUTH AFRICA </p><p>HAS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY WITH MBEKI\'S ASSUMPTION </p><p>OF THE PRESIDENCY.  ZIMBABWE\'S LEANING ON KABILA TO </p><p>ACCEPT A SOUTH AFRICAN ROLE MAY ULTIMATELY MAKE IT </p><p>POSSIBLE FOR SOUTH AFRICA TO PLAY A MORE SUBSTANTIVE </p><p>ROLE IN DROC PEACEKEEPING.
