<p>UNCLAS COLOMBO 000126 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>FOR DS/IP/SA, DS/IP/SPC/CCBC, DS/OP/SPC/WMD, M/MED AND </p><p>SA/INS </p><p>New Delhi for RMO </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ASEC, AMED, PTER, CE, MIssion Security </p><p>SUBJECT: SUSPICIOUS WHITE POWDER AT AMEMBASSY COLOMBO </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but unclassified - protect accordingly. </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) During the late afternoon hours on January 21, our </p><p>Protocol FSN employee opened a locally-delivered letter at </p><p>her desk.  Upon looking into the envelope, the employee </p><p>noticed an unidentified white powder substance.  The </p><p>employee contacted RSO.  Upon arrival, RSO turned off the </p><p>office\'s air vent, inspected the office and determined that </p><p>the substance did not appear to be spilled.  The employee </p><p>was sent to get cleaned-up.  RSO wearing appropriate </p><p>protective gear retrieved the envelope and locked the </p><p>office.  Without removal of the letter, the envelope was </p><p>further inspected by RSO in our off-site mail handling room. </p><p>Inspection revealed that the envelope contained a </p><p>handwritten threat letter and a white powder substance the </p><p>consistency of the flour.  The envelope and letter were </p><p>triple-sealed in zip-lock bags and secured in the off-site </p><p>facility.  The following morning (1/22/03) the package was </p><p>delivered to Sri Lanka Medical Research Institute for </p><p>analysis. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Also on January 22, a second powder-filled envelope </p><p>was intercepted in our off-site mailroom.  This envelope </p><p>displayed the return address for the Sri Lanka Finance </p><p>Minister.  The envelope was sealed in zip-lock bags and </p><p>released to the Sri Lanka Police for investigation.  We do </p><p>not of course believe the envelope came from the Finance </p><p>Minister, but because it listed the Minister by name and </p><p>address, the matter was referred directly to the police. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Post treats all white powder incidents seriously, </p><p>but also suspects the testing will determine the white </p><p>powder substance is benign.  RSO is attempting to determine </p><p>how the first letter got past the off-site mail screening </p><p>process, but has in the meantime reissued instructions about </p><p>appropriate mail handling procedures. </p><p> </p><p>AMSELEM </p><p></p></div>
