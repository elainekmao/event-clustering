AN OP-ED BY AMBASSADOR JOSEPH SULLIVAN RECEIVED </p><p>    PROMINENT PUBLICATION IN TWO INFLUENTIAL ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>    NEWSPAPERS ON NOVEMBER 1.  THE PRIVATELY-OWNED "DAILY </p><p>    NEWS" CARRIED THE PIECE AS THE ONLY OPINION PIECE ON </p><p>    THEIR OP-ED PAGE.  THE PRIVATELY OWNED WEEKLY </p><p>    "FINANCIAL GAZETTE" DEDICATED AN ENTIRE PAGE TO THE </p><p>    ARTICLE.  TEXT OF THE OP-ED PIECE FOLLOWS. </p><p> </p><p>2. ACTING TOGETHER AGAINST TERROR </p><p>BY JOSEPH G. SULLIVAN </p><p>UNITED STATES AMBASSADOR TO ZIMBABWE </p><p> </p><p>TERRORISM POSES AN OVERRIDING THREAT TO INNOCENT PEOPLE </p><p>EVERYWHERE.  AS THE LONG LIST OF NATIONS WHO LOST </p><p>CITIZENS IN THE ATTACKS ON THE WORLD TRADE CENTER </p><p>SHOWS, TERROR\'S INNOCENT VICTIMS ARE OF ALL </p><p>NATIONALITIES, AND ALL FAITHS.  AMONG THE NATIONS </p><p>ATTACKED IN NEW YORK WAS ZIMBABWE, TWO OF WHOSE </p><p>CITIZENS ARE AMONG THE MORE THAN 30 AFRICANS KILLED OR </p><p>MISSING.  TERRORISM\'S EVIL AND PERVASIVE NATURE MEANS </p><p>NO ONE CAN FEEL TRULY SAFE.  THIS IS TRUE IN ALL </p><p>PLACES, IN ALL LANDS. </p><p> </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGING THIS FACT, THE COMMUNITY OF NATIONS IS </p><p>WORKING TOGETHER IN A GLOBAL EFFORT TO PROTECT THE </p><p>SAFETY AND RIGHTS OF ALL THE WORLD\'S PEOPLE.  MORE THAN </p><p>40 COUNTRIES IN EUROPE, THE MIDDLE EAST, AFRICA AND </p><p>ASIA HAVE GRANTED AIR TRANSIT OR LANDING RIGHTS TO U.S. </p><p>AND BRITISH MILITARY AIRCRAFT.  MORE COUNTRIES HAVE </p><p>SHARED INTELLIGENCE.   MANY MORE NATIONS, INCLUDING </p><p>ZIMBABWE, HAVE EXPRESSED OUTRAGE AT THE SEPTEMBER 11 </p><p>ATTACKS AND HAVE STATED THEIR DETERMINATION TO TAKE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03277  01 OF 02  020557Z </p><p>PART IN THE GLOBAL EFFORT TO COMBAT TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>THESE NATIONS UNDERSTAND, AS DO MOST ZIMBABWEANS, THAT </p><p>THE WAR AGAINST TERROR IS NOT ABOUT THE WEST VS. ISLAM </p><p>OR ABOUT DISAGREEMENT WITH PAST OR PRESENT AMERICAN </p><p>FOREIGN POLICIES.  THIS IS A WAR AGAINST THE HATE- </p><p>FILLED, UNILATERAL INTOLERANCE OF A TINY NUMBER OF </p><p>PEOPLE AND THEIR PROTECTORS.  AS PRESIDENT BUSH PUT IT, </p><p>"THIS IS A WAR AGAINST HATRED."  IT IS A WAR TO PROTECT </p><p>THE RIGHTS AND DREAMS OF THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE </p><p>WORLD\'S PEOPLE.  IT IS A WAR TO PRESERVE FREEDOM OF </p><p>RELIGION, THE RIGHT OF ALL PEOPLE TO EDUCATION AND </p><p>PROFESSIONAL ACCOMPLISHMENT, THE RIGHT TO SPEAK FREELY </p><p>AND ENGAGE IN PEACEFUL DEBATE, THE RIGHT TO TRAVEL, THE </p><p>RIGHT TO ENJOY MUSIC, THEATER, DANCE, ART AND </p><p>LITERATURE, AND THE RIGHT TO BE FREE OF FEAR. </p><p> </p><p>IN RESPONSE TO THE ATTACKS ON HUMANITY THAT TOOK PLACE </p><p>IN THE UNITED STATES ON SEPTEMBER 11, THE UNITED STATES </p><p>AND GREAT BRITAIN HAVE BEGUN THE MILITARY ACTIONS THAT </p><p>FORM PART OF THE GLOBAL CAMPAIGN TO DEFEAT TERRORISM. </p><p>THE UNITED NATIONS CHARTER AND THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL </p><p>RECOGNIZE THESE ACTIONS AS LEGITIMATE MEASURES OF SELF- </p><p>DEFENSE.  THEY ARE ALSO THE MOST VISIBLE PART OF A VAST </p><p>AND UNPRECEDENTED INTERNATIONAL EFFORT TO EXTEND THE </p><p>REACH OF JUSTICE TO THOSE PLACES WHERE THE GERM OF </p><p>TERROR HAS FESTERED. </p><p> </p><p>PRESIDENT BUSH\'S ORDER DIRECTING MILITARY ACTION </p><p>AGAINST THE AL-QAEDA NETWORK AND THE TALIBAN REGIME </p><p>THAT GIVES THEM SHELTER WAS DELIBERATE AND FOCUSED IN </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03277  01 OF 02  020557Z </p><p>TIMING AND SCOPE.  ALTHOUGH THE RAGE OF THE AMERICAN </p><p>PEOPLE AND THE WORLD IS WELL JUSTIFIED, THE U.S. DOES </p><p>NOT STRIKE IN ANGER AND DOES NOT TARGET INNOCENTS.  IN </p><p>THE DAYS FOLLOWING SEPTEMBER 11, THE WORLD HAS COME TO </p><p>REALIZE, THAT NATIONS MUST WORK TOGETHER TO DEFEAT </p><p>TERROR.  GOVERNMENTS HAVE COME TO REALIZE THAT ACTING </p><p>RESOLUTELY IN THE INTEREST OF COMMON GLOBAL SECURITY IS </p><p>A MATTER OF URGENT NECESSITY.  PRESIDENT MUGABE AND </p><p>MINISTER OF JUSTICE CHINAMASA, IN THEIR STRONG </p><p>CONDEMNATIONS OF TERRORISM, HAVE MADE ZIMBABWE\'S </p><p>POSITION CLEAR. </p><p> </p><p>LEFT UNCHECKED, TERRORISM WILL AFFECT THE LIVES OF </p><p>EVERYONE.  TERRORISTS ROB INNOCENT VICTIMS OF LIFE, AND </p><p>ROB ALL OF US OF OUR SECURITY.  TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE </p><p>VERY FREEDOMS THAT ARE THE HALLMARKS OF DEMOCRATIC </p><p>SOCIETIES, TERRORISTS HAVE DEMONSTRATED COLD-BLOODED </p><p>SKILLS OF INFILTRATION.  DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY, THEY </p><p>THREATEN OUR FREEDOM. </p><p> </p><p>THE PEOPLE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE TRAGEDIES OF SEPTEMBER </p><p>11 DO NOT UNDERSTAND DISCUSSION, NEGOTIATION OR </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ5545 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  03277  02 OF 02  020557Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DODE-00  SRPP-00 </p><p>      DS-00    UTED-00  VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   VCE-00   NSAE-00 </p><p>      NSCE-00  TEST-00  USIE-00  DSCC-00  NFAT-00  SAS-00     /000W </p><p>                  ------------------38D9E5  020557Z /38 </p><p>R 020523Z NOV 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 0179 </p><p>INFO OAU COLLECTIVE </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 003277 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF, AF/S, AF/PD (COX, ROBERTSON, SANDERS) </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO PREL ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: ANTI-TERROR OP-ED BY AMBASSADOR SULLIVAN </p><p> </p><p>COMPROMISE.

THAT IS WHAT THE </p><p>CURRENT MILITARY ACTIONS, AND THE MANY OTHER EFFORTS </p><p>NOW UNDERWAY, SEEK TO DO. </p><p> </p><p>PEOPLE OF ALL NATIONS AND FAITHS KNOW THAT WE ARE ALL </p><p>VULNERABLE TO TERROR, WHICH BY ITS NATURE IS CARELESS </p><p>OF ITS TARGETS AND INDIFFERENT TO HUMAN LIFE.  SUCH </p><p>SOLIDARITY HAS NOW TURNED TO SUPPORT OF WORLD ACTION TO </p><p>ROOT OUT TERROR. THIS COALITION OF CONCERNED NATIONS IS </p><p>A TRULY HISTORIC RESPONSE TO AN UNPARALLELED ATTACK AND </p><p>CONTINUING THREAT AGAINST EVERYONE. </p><p> </p><p>WORKING TOGETHER WITH A SHARED SENSE OF PURPOSE WE CAN </p><p>EXTEND THE REACH OF JUSTICE EVEN INTO THE DARKEST CAVES </p><p>WHERE TERROR HIDES, AND MAKE OUR WORLD A SAFER PLACE. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
