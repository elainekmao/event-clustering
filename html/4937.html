Under headline "Only return to sanity will end food </p><p>      shortages" the independent daily "The Daily News" dedicated </p><p>      its January 3 editorial to persuading the government of </p><p>      Zimbabwe to cooperate with the international community, </p><p>      adding that "the survival of the nation should not be made </p><p>      a sacrificial lamb on the alter of political expediency." </p><p>      Excerpts follow: </p><p> </p><p>  2.    "The only way to end the shortages caused by the self- </p><p>      inflicted economic crisis - the worst in Zimbabwe\'s history </p><p>      - is for the government to face reality, by accepting aid </p><p>      from the international community.  It is imperative for the </p><p>      government to bring back sanity and peace so as to create </p><p>      an economic environment that does not drive potential </p><p>      investors away or cost the country thousands of lives </p><p>      through starvation.  The survival of the nation should not </p><p>      be made a sacrificial lamb on the alter of political </p><p>      expediency. . .If the government is really anxious about </p><p>      the fate of the millions of people facing death from </p><p>      starvation, they must swallow their pride and accept </p><p>      responsibility for the current food shortage.  They must </p><p>      create the appropriate conditions to resuscitate the </p><p>      economy that has itself been starved of investment.  The </p><p>      land reform program is a disaster because it was ill </p><p>      planned.  Millions of people cannot pay for that blunder </p><p>      with their lives." </p><p> </p><p>WHITEHEAD </p><p></p></div>
