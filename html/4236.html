<p>UNCLAS HARARE 002429 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PD, AF/S, AF/S, AF/RA, AF/PDPA </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: EDITORIAL ON FOOD CRISIS AND ZIMBABWE\'S </p><p>RELATIONS WITH THE WEST </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   In its November 7 editorial, "NEPAD peer review: </p><p>      why it scares some leaders," the independent daily </p><p>      "Daily News" challenged the Government of Zimbabwe to </p><p>      address allegations of using food aid as a political </p><p>      weapon. Excerpts follow. </p><p> </p><p>  2.   ". . .The government has set itself on a </p><p>      political course against the West, with the United </p><p>      States this week threatening to do more than just </p><p>      protest against the unfair distribution of food aid. </p><p>      It is wrong-headed of the government to believe that </p><p>      there are no Zimbabweans who are aggrieved by the use </p><p>      of food aid as a political weapon, and that the </p><p>      accusation by the West is without foundation.  It is </p><p>      just as wrong for the government to believe that all </p><p>      the criticism and condemnation of its political and </p><p>      economic blunders is confined to, or is influenced by, </p><p>      the West.  There are millions of Zimbabweans facing </p><p>      starvation who blame the government for their </p><p>      miserable situation.  They don\'t need the West to tell </p><p>      them when their empty stomachs are rumbling from </p><p>      hunger.  Instead of stubbornly seeing a Western spy </p><p>      under every bed, the government ought to open its eyes </p><p>      to the consequences of its policies. . .  Sovereignty </p><p>      which places little value on human life is not worth </p><p>      the paper it is written on." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
