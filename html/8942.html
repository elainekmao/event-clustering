Boggs for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p>======== </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S) Despite the agreed terms of the cease-fire with the </p><p>Government of Nepal (GoN) barring extortion, Maoists have </p><p>continued to press businesses and local residents for </p><p>"donations," increasing both the breadth and scope of their </p><p>demands.  In areas lacking a government presence, the Maoists </p><p>have begun to collect taxes and royalties on natural resource </p><p>harvests and skim proceeds from cannabis smuggling.  Contrary </p><p>to earlier reports (refs D and E), the Maoists have lowered </p><p>their profile in garnering funds from remittances.  The GoN </p><p>has failed to reduce Maoist access to funds and does not </p><p>appear to be in a position to do so in the near-term.  If </p><p>reports are to be believed, Maoist fund-raising has increased </p><p>since the commencement of the cease-fire.  Some sources </p><p>indicate that these funds may be intended to build up </p><p>military supplies for a resumption of hostilities.  End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p>Overview </p><p>========= </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  Nepal\'s Maoists have adopted several methods to fund </p><p>their activities.  The following provides a summary of </p><p>Mission information on Maoist sources of finances, including </p><p>extortion, taxation on natural resource harvests, drug </p><p>trafficking, and remittances.  Also addressed are the limited </p><p>activities of the Government of Nepal (GoN) to restrict </p><p>Maoist finances. </p><p> </p><p>Extortion </p><p>========== </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Nepal\'s Maoists have continued to extort money and </p><p>food despite specific prohibitions in the March 13 Code of </p><p>Conduct adopted as the basis for the current cease-fire (ref </p><p>A).  Over the past three weeks, Maoist cadre have increased </p><p>their efforts by demanding more funds and broadening their </p><p>number of targets.  According to Sandip Shah, General Manager </p><p>of Bhote Koshi Power and member of the wealthy Soaltee Group </p><p>of Companies, the business group has been asked repeatedly </p><p>for funds.  The amounts demanded has tripled since the </p><p>beginning of the cease-fire.  Embassy interlocutors who </p><p>reside in Kathmandu Valley report that the Maoists have </p><p>launched widespread extortion drives on a house-to-house </p><p>basis, with demands ranging up to USD 1,300. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Throughout rural Nepal, Maoists systematically </p><p>extort both food and funds to maintain their local forces. </p><p>At a June 13 meeting of international donors to Nepal, </p><p>attendees reported an up-tick in Maoist extortion activities </p><p>nationwide and noted areas of particular concern: </p><p>-- The German development agency GTZ reported that Maoist </p><p>extortion from project staff in Ramechap District (60 kms </p><p>East of Kathmandu) was increasing and may force the project </p><p>to shut down; </p><p>-- The UN Security Office saw a substantial increase of </p><p>extortion in Dhankuta District (541 kms East of Kathmandu); </p><p>and </p><p>-- GTZ and the UK Department for International Development </p><p>(DfID) reported a sizable increase in extortion from project </p><p>staff in Surkhet District (in the Maoist-affected midwest) </p><p>over the past month. </p><p>At the same meeting DfID staff noted that villagers in Humla </p><p>(a district in Nepal\'s northwest) expressed frustration that </p><p>after six years of Maoist local governance and extortion, no </p><p>services are being provided nor development taking place. </p><p>5.  (C) An independent AmCit consultant provided the Embassy </p><p>with a pre-publication draft of a paper on Nepal\'s Maoists. </p><p>In a footnote, he details some of the extortion (termed </p><p>"revolutionary taxation" by the Maoists) he observed in </p><p>Maoist controlled areas.  Small shopkeepers in Rolpa (a </p><p>midwestern district in the Maoist heartland) report payments </p><p>of USD 0.65 per month; and government employees working in </p><p>Maoist "occupied areas" report payments equal to one day\'s </p><p>wages per month, USD 1.30 to 2.60.  He also reports that the </p><p>Maoists are adopting kidnapping for ransom.  (Note:  The </p><p>Mission has no confirmation of the use of kidnapping for </p><p>ransom as a method of fund-raising.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) The Maoists typically defend their continued practice </p><p>of extortion by claiming funds so collected are "voluntarily" </p><p>donated.  When a representative of a prominent American firm </p><p>pressed the issue, he was told that traditional sources of </p><p>financing--including bank robberies that reportedly had </p><p>netted them USD 6 million--have been restricted by the </p><p>cease-fire, requiring the Maoists to fund-raise in other </p><p>ways.  In this particular instance, the Maoist representative </p><p>stated that he took direction from Maoist negotiator and </p><p>Central Committee member Krishna Bahadur Mahara (ref A). </p><p> </p><p>Taxation of Natural Resource Harvests </p><p>====================================== </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) The Embassy has learned through both press reports </p><p>and visits to rural areas that the Maoists are collecting </p><p>taxes on harvests of natural resources.  During a tour of </p><p>Doti (a district in Nepal\'s far-west), the Ambassador was </p><p>told by a district forestry official that the Maoists had </p><p>taken over ranger posts and are now collecting fees for </p><p>harvesting forest products.  Forestry fees were previously </p><p>collected by forest rangers and placed in government coffers </p><p>(ref B).  In an extreme case, the press reported June 14, </p><p>Maoists in Baglung (a district in Nepal\'s midwest) were </p><p>collecting royalties on the harvest of Yarchagumba (an </p><p>herbal/insect product with a reported effect similar to </p><p>Viagra).  The rare herb ranges in price from USD 1,300 to USD </p><p>1,800 per kg in India and China.  Under normal circumstances, </p><p>the government collects royalties of USD 260 per kg.  The </p><p>destruction of forestry offices in the district has left a </p><p>void in the government\'s collection capacity which the </p><p>enterprising Maoists are only too eagerly filling.  The press </p><p>also regularly reports that Maoists stop illicit timber </p><p>harvesters in Nepal\'s lowlands and request funds for the </p><p>harvesters\' passage.  Those who pay are normally left alone, </p><p>while those who refuse are usually beaten and have their </p><p>timber confiscated.  (Comment:  The taxation of natural </p><p>resource harvests is difficult to generalize.  Maoist </p><p>activities reflect the resources available in their area of </p><p>operation and the level of government presence.) </p><p> </p><p>Drug Trafficking </p><p>================= </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Superintendent of Police for the Narcotic Drug </p><p>Control Law Enforcement Unit Hemant Malla reported to poloff </p><p>and econoff that Maoist insurgents in the middle hills of </p><p>Nepal levy a tax on both the cultivation and transportation </p><p>of cannabis.  Malla stated that most of the cannabis is </p><p>smuggled to India.  He went on to report that there is some </p><p>anecdotal evidence that the Maoists are taking a cut of from </p><p>the Indian smugglers, but of an unknown amount.  One source </p><p>told Malla that a 35 percent tax is being levied on cannabis </p><p>sold to China through rural Dolpa (ref C).  The Dolpa route </p><p>is not normally a significant route for cannabis smuggling, </p><p>due to the lack of roads.  However, the closure of the </p><p>Nepal-China border due to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome </p><p>(SARS) led to an increase of cultivation and shipment through </p><p>Dolpa. </p><p> </p><p>Remittances </p><p>============ </p><p> </p><p>8.  (S) Embassy reports of increasing Maoist interference in </p><p>remittances (refs D and E) during the November/December 2002 </p><p>timeframe could not be reaffirmed during interviews with </p><p>contacts in June 2003.  Reports in late 2002 alleged that </p><p>Maoists were designating individuals to be sent overseas for </p><p>employment, were recruiting members from overseas to send </p><p>remittances for the Maoist cause, and extorting remittances </p><p>from recipient family members in Nepal.  In interviews in </p><p>June 2003, however, interlocutors reported not receiving </p><p>extortion requests.  (Note:  The lack of Maoist contact with </p><p>manpower agencies and others involved in Nepal\'s growing </p><p>remittance business does not match recent reports of the </p><p>Maoists\' fund-drive activities.  This change in Maoist </p><p>approach came during a period when remittances were labeled </p><p>in press and government statements as the only healthy </p><p>economic sector.  The Embassy will continue to expand </p><p>contacts in this area in an attempt to corroborate and </p><p>account for this apparent shift.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p>GoN Actions </p><p>============ </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) The GoN has done very little to suppress Maoist </p><p>fund-raising or to seize Maoist assets.  According to </p><p>Executive Director Rajan Singh Bhandari, Nepal\'s central bank </p><p>(NRB) seized roughly USD 65,000 from accounts of prominent </p><p>Maoists in early 2002.  All of the accounts were held at the </p><p>Agriculture Development Bank of Nepal.  The NRB has made no </p><p>subsequent seizures and lacks a investigative arm to seek out </p><p>further Maoist assets.  The NRB can claim, however, some </p><p>success in moving remittance transfers from the traditional </p><p>hundi/hawala to formal banking channels.  The NRB reports </p><p>that this change increased its foreign exchange holdings by </p><p>twenty-five percent in the last fiscal quarter. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>======== </p><p> </p><p>10. (S) Maoist claims that they can no longer fund their </p><p>activities through traditional sources, i.e., bank robberies, </p><p>belies the scope of their financial operations.  Extortion in </p><p>Kathmandu Valley and the increase in the demands on Nepalese </p><p>business groups could well make up for the amounts stolen </p><p>over the past seven years.  It appears that the GoN, out of </p><p>fear of hampering the peace process, has restrained its </p><p>police forces from arresting Maoist extorters.  The lack of </p><p>GoN pressure may have emboldened the Maoists to grab as much </p><p>as they can during the peace process.  The level of </p><p>fund-raising seems to have increased beyond the revenues </p><p>required to maintain Maoist cadres in the field.  Reports of </p><p>excesses funds has fueled speculation that the Maoists may be </p><p>using the money to restock and re-equip in possible </p><p>preparation for a resumption of hostilities. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
