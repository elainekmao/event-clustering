<p>UNCLAS RABAT 12531 </p><p> </p><p>S/CT FOR WHARTON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  N/A </p><p>TAGS:  PTER, MO </p><p>SUBJECT:  MOROCCO:  1989 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A) STATE 363024, B) STATE 31797 </p><p> </p><p>1.  FOLLOWING IS POST\'S CONTRIBUTION TO DEPARTMENT\'S </p><p>ANNUAL REPORT ON TERRORISM: </p><p> </p><p>IN 1989 THE UNITED STATES AND MOROCCO SIGNED AN </p><p>AGREEMENT ON JOINT COOPERATION IN FIGHTING AGAINST </p><p>INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM, ORGANIZED CRIME AND THE </p><p>ILLICIT PRODUCTION, TRAFFICKING AND ABUSE OF </p><p>NARCOTICS (REF B).  IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF </p><p>THIS AGREEMENT, THE UNITED STATES HAS ENJOYED EXCELLENT </p><p>COOPERATION WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF MOROCCO IN COUNTERING </p><p>TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>IN 1983 THE UNITED STATES AND MOROCCO NEGOTIATED A </p><p>MUTUAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE CONVENTION (WHICH INCLUDES </p><p>EXTRADITION PROVISIONS).  THE AGREEMENT WAS SIGNED </p><p>BY THE UNITED STATES, BUT HAS NOT YET BEEN SIGNED BY </p><p>MOROCCO. </p><p> </p><p>MOROCCO SUFFERED FROM LIBYAN SUPPORTED DOMESTIC </p><p>TERRORIST ATTACKS IN THE EARLY SEVENTIES, BUT AS A </p><p>RESULT OF A CHANGING DOMESTIC/REGIONAL POLITICAL </p><p>ENVIRONMENT, THERE IS NO LONGER ANY SIGNIFICANT </p><p>THREAT OF POLITICALLY MOTIVATED TERRORISM IN MOROCCO. </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT OF MOROCCO, AND KING HASSAN II PERSONALLY, </p><p>ARE ADAMANTLY OPPOSED TO TERRORISM.  THE PLO HAS MAIN- </p><p>TAINED DIPLOMATIC REPRESENTATION IN MOROCCO SINCE 1971, </p><p>AND MOROCCO CONTINUES TO PROVIDE STRONG DIPLOMATIC AND </p><p>POLITICAL BACKING FOR ARAFAT AND THE PLO MAINSTREAM. </p><p>MOROCCO COUNSELS MODERATION TO THE PLO, AND MOROCCAN </p><p>POLICY SEEKS TO PROMOTE A NEGOTIATED SETTLEMENT TO </p><p>THE ARAB-ISRAELI CONFLICT.  THE MOROCCAN GOVERNMENT, </p><p>THEREFORE, DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY KIND OF SUPPORT  FOR </p><p>TERRORIST GROUPS, WHETHER WITHIN OR OUTSIDE THE PLO </p><p>UMBRELLA. </p><p> </p><p>THERE WERE NO ACTS OF TERRORISM IN MOROCCO IN 1989, AND </p><p>SO, NO PROSECUTIONS INVOLVING TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>USSERY </p><p></p></div>
