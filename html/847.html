<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L BANJUL 002424 </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/W </p><p>ALSO FOR AID </p><p>DAKAR PASS TO PRAIA </p><p>DAKAR FOR RSO, POLOFF </p><p>LONDON FOR YOUNG </p><p>PARIS FOR MORAN </p><p>USEU FOR NAHAS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: OCTOBER 1, 2001 </p><p>TAGS: MCAP, MOPS, PGOV, KDEM, GA </p><p>SUBJECT:  THE GAMBIA: JAMMEH\'S VICTORY -  VICTORY FOR </p><p>THE MILITARY? </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) BANJUL 2394 </p><p> </p><p>1. CLASSIFIED BY POLITICAL OFFICER KIMBERLY KELLY, </p><p>REASON 1.5 B & D </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) SUMMARY:  AS THE DUST SETTLES FROM THE </p><p>ELECTION, MORE IS CREATED AS THE MILITARY TAKE TO THE </p><p>STREETS, EVEN THOUGH JAMMEH DISSOLVED THE ARMED </p><p>FORCES PROVISIONAL RULING COUNCIL. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) THE PRESENCE OF SOLDIERS ON THE STREETS IN THE </p><p>GREATER BANJUL AREA HAS INCREASED DRAMATICALLY IN THE </p><p>PAST MONTH COMPARED TO WHAT WE HAVE SEEN HERE OVER </p><p>THE PAST YEAR. DURING THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN, </p><p>YAHYA JAMMEH WAS ALWAYS ACCOMPANIED BY A LARGE </p><p>MILITARY BODYGUARD.  THE GAMBIA NATIONAL ARMY (GNA) </p><p>COMMANDER, LT. COL. JATTA, WAS SEEN AT JAMMEH RALLIES </p><p>WEARING JAMMEH COLORS.  SOLDIERS MADE IT NO SECRET </p><p>WHO THE MILITARY SUPPORTED IN THE ELECTION. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) THE MILITARY TOOK TO THE STREETS IN FULL FORCE </p><p>ON SEPTEMBER 27 AND 28 IN CELEBRATION OF YAHYA </p><p>JAMMEH\'S VICTORY AT THE POLLS.  SEVERAL TRUCK LOADS </p><p>OF SOLDIERS DROVE PAST THE EMBASSY, SHOUTING AND </p><p>WAVING THEIR FISTS.  ONE ELECTION OBSERVER SAID IT IS </p><p>AS IF THE MILITARY HAS NOW LEGITIMIZED ITSELF. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) IN HIS ADDRESS TO THE NATION ON SATURDAY, </p><p>SEPTEMBER 28, JAMMEH ANNOUNCED THE DISSOLUTION OF THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT OF THE ARMED FORCES PROVISIONAL RULING </p><p>COUNCIL, WHICH HAS BEEN THE GOVERNING BODY SINCE THE </p><p>JULY 1994 COUP.  HE STATED THAT THE CABINET IS THE </p><p>80LE PROVISIONAL GOVERNING BODY UNTIL SUCH TIME THAT </p><p>THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY IN ELECTED. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) COMMENT: IT APPEARS THAT THE SOLDIERS SEE </p><p>JAMMEH\'S VICTORY AS A VICTORY FOR THE MILITARY. </p><p>THE MILITARY POWER THAT TRAVELLED WITH JAMMEH DURING </p><p>HIS CAMPAIGN SERVED AS INTIMIDATION AS WELL AS </p><p>PROTECTION (ALTHOUGH WHY HE WOULD NEED ANTI-AIRCRAFT </p><p>GUNS (REFTEL) AS PROTECTION IS AN OPEN QUESTION). THE </p><p>OVERT PRESENCE OF THE MILITARY ON THE STREETS HAS </p><p>PROBABLY HELPED MAINTAIN THE CALM WE HAVE WITNESSED </p><p>SINCE THE ELECTION.  WHETHER OR NOT IT WILL BE </p><p>MAINTAINED ONCE THE SOLDIERS FINALLY GO BACK TO THE </p><p>BARRACKS REMAINS TO BE SEEN. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ROHN </p><p></p></div>
