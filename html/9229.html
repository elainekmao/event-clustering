Mainstream newspapers have started dedicating acres of </p><p>      editorial space to mull over United States President George </p><p>      W. Bush\'s visit to Africa.  Editorial excerpts follow: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   Under headline "The Bush African trail" the </p><p>      independent weekly "The Daily News on Sunday" (06/29) </p><p>      comments: </p><p> </p><p>      ". . .George W. Bush. . .who begins an historic </p><p>      journey through a changing Africa next month, has an </p><p>      opportunity to join that pantheon of conservative </p><p>      statesmen, by engaging the leaders in a dialogue for </p><p>      a change in their priorities. . .Understandably, </p><p>      Bush is not visiting Zimbabwe, because President </p><p>      Robert Mugabe is (an) old man who refuses to open </p><p>      his eyes to the reality of his country.  Politically </p><p>      and economically, he is bereft of new ideas to </p><p>      rescue his country from certain disaster.  He should </p><p>      step aside to let younger people with 21st century </p><p>      ideas take over.  Bush must convince South Africa\'s </p><p>      President Thabo Mbeki that Mugabe must step down if </p><p>      the regime change in Zimbabwe is to be without </p><p>      bloodshed." </p><p> </p><p>  3.   Under headline "African leaders must ignore Bush\'s </p><p>      antics" the government-controlled weekly "The Sunday </p><p>      Mail" (06/29) comments: </p><p> </p><p>      "The American President, George W. Bush, has grown </p><p>      so arrogant that he is now giving deadlines on when </p><p>      governments should be set up or deposed, ahead of </p><p>      his African visit.  The contempt he is showing for </p><p>      African leadership is as sickening as his attitude </p><p>      towards the leadership of the people of Afghanistan </p><p>      and Iraq. . .On what pedestal is he standing?  In </p><p>      fact, he speaks with an air of a god.  It was clear </p><p>      that the weapons of mass destruction that his </p><p>      country possesses have deluded him into believing </p><p>      that he is now a divine being who can speak and it </p><p>      will (be) done.  He sees himself as Almighty God. . </p><p>      .No wonder the revered former South African </p><p>      president, Nelson Mandela, once remarked that the </p><p>      Texan `cannot think properly\' anymore.  We welcome </p><p>      the stance that Mr. Mandela has taken in advance of </p><p>      Bush\'s visit that the Texan should be met with a </p><p>      clear message of how appalled Africans are by the </p><p>      murderous policies of the Bush and Blair </p><p>      administrations.  African leaders across the </p><p>      continent must stand firm and refuse to be </p><p>      patronized. . .Bush is a war-monger and not a </p><p>      peacemaker and must be made to feel like </p><p>      one. . .Zimbabwe and Africa should simply ignore </p><p>      Colin Powell and Bush and look inside and among </p><p>      themselves for solutions to the challenges that </p><p>      beset them." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
