<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 HANOI 001411 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV, DRL, and DRL/PHD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, EAID, SOCI, VM </p><p>SUBJECT: TRAINING VIETNAM\'S JUDGES:  MORE WORK NEEDED </p><p> </p><p>Ref:  A)  HCMC 0499 and previous </p><p> </p><p>      B)  HANOI 0935 </p><p>      C)  FBIS SEP20021128000048 </p><p>      D)  02 HANOI 2902 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  Summary:  The low quality of professional skills </p><p>among Vietnamese judges at all levels -- local, provincial </p><p>and national -- is a well-recognized problem (refs c & d). </p><p>Judges for the high-profile Nam Cam trial in Ho Chi Minh </p><p>City (ref a) were carefully picked from among the best </p><p>available throughout the country.  Undergraduate legal </p><p>education became available only in 1979, and not until 1990 </p><p>were new judges required to have even a bachelor\'s degree. </p><p>Efforts to provide intensive specialized training for judges </p><p>began in 1998 with the creation of a Ministry of Justice </p><p>(MOJ)-managed training school.  The GVN is debating the </p><p>merits of establishing a National Judicial Training Academy </p><p>to help improve the quality of judges and other court </p><p>personnel.  The GVN welcomes foreign technical assistance, </p><p>including from the U.S., to improve the quality of its </p><p>judges.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>Humble beginnings </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.   (U)  Vietnam did not even have a Ministry of Justice </p><p>between 1960 and 1981; thereafter, it was considered a very </p><p>backwater and under-funded Ministry until at least the </p><p>1990s.  (Its subsequent rise was demonstrated with its move </p><p>in 2002 to the elegantly refurbished -- at least on the </p><p>exterior -- old Soviet Embassy buildings on a major </p><p>thoroughfare.)  No tertiary-level legal education was </p><p>available until 1979.  Judges were not required to have a </p><p>bachelor-level degree -- in any field -- until 1990. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>Academic Training </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  In Vietnam, academic legal education is offered </p><p>primarily by the Hanoi Law University, the Ho Chi Minh City </p><p>Law University, and the Law Faculty of Hanoi National </p><p>University, although smaller law faculties also exist at Hue </p><p>University, Can Tho University, Dalat University, and the </p><p>National Police Academy.  The Hanoi Law University, </p><p>established in 1979, is the largest and most prestigious </p><p>legal education program in term of numbers of students and </p><p>lecturers.  The Ho Chi Minh City Law University was </p><p>established in 1987, initially as a branch of the Hanoi Law </p><p>University.  Private institutions are not yet allowed to </p><p>provide legal training, according to one law professor. </p><p>Vice Rector of the Hanoi Law University Le Hong Hanh told </p><p>poloffs that training at law colleges, even at the graduate </p><p>level, is abstract and not tailored for professional judges, </p><p>trial attorneys, prosecutors, or other court officials. </p><p>Graduates from law colleges are not trained for specific </p><p>functions such as being a prosecutor, he asserted.  The </p><p>Police Academy, under the Ministry of Public Security (MPS), </p><p>reportedly provides a more vocational approach, but only for </p><p>MPS staff. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  The law bachelor\'s curriculum requires four years. </p><p>One and a half years are devoted to classes mandated by the </p><p>Ministry of Education and Training (MOET) for all Vietnamese </p><p>college students, including Marxist-Leninist ideology and Ho </p><p>Chi Minh thought, "scientific socialism," foreign languages, </p><p>and computer courses.  There is a separate set of core </p><p>courses for all law students that provides basic courses in </p><p>various fields of law -- criminal, civil, family, </p><p>administrative, labor, land, financial, banking, and </p><p>international.  The core law course also includes a set of </p><p>historical and comparative law classes covering theories of </p><p>relations between "the state and the law," culminating in a </p><p>specific study of state and law relations in Vietnam.  This </p><p>sequence, together with the compulsory courses, places the </p><p>law and courts in the clear context of a state "guided" by </p><p>the CPV.  The final part of the law school curriculum is </p><p>composed of specialized courses in the fields of law </p><p>mentioned above as well as related classes such as criminal </p><p>investigation, forensics, auditing, intellectual property, </p><p>and contracts. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  According to law professors, there is currently </p><p>some internal debate over how to handle "unclear issues" in </p><p>the curriculum over the CPV\'s future role in the kind of </p><p>"rule of law" state that Vietnam is becoming.  The formal </p><p>curriculum still hews closely to "the Party line," but there </p><p>are a few "study groups" including professors and students </p><p>that discuss such issues "rather freely," according to some </p><p>foreign-educated professors. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>Training the next generation of judges </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  In January 2002, a CPV Politburo resolution on </p><p>"urgent judicial tasks" identified judicial training as a </p><p>national priority.  Also in 2002, the National Assembly </p><p>revised the Ordinance on Judges and Lay Assessors to mandate </p><p>that all future judges hold a certificate from MOJ\'s </p><p>training school, which had been set up in 1998, prior to </p><p>appointment.  (The requirement does not hold for sitting </p><p>judges.)  Lay assessors, who also sit on court panels and </p><p>decide cases alongside judges, still receive very little </p><p>training (ref b). </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  According to the MOJ school director, Dr. Phan Huu </p><p>Thu, there have been six sessions of these one-year courses </p><p>for "judges to be" thus far.  Participants -- mostly court </p><p>clerks with several years of experience assisting judges </p><p>administratively -- are selected by district and provincial </p><p>courts for their potential to win appointment as judges. </p><p>They must also be otherwise qualified for the bench: </p><p>candidates must be "reliable," have a bachelor\'s degree in </p><p>law, be of "good character," and have at least four years </p><p>experience in the legal field for appointment to a district </p><p>court (six years for a provincial court).  CPV membership is </p><p>not a formal requirement.  Beginning in 2004, the school </p><p>will require an entrance exam to make sure that all </p><p>applicants are sufficient qualified academically, Thu said. </p><p>The school also has courses for other legal officials </p><p>including clerks of court, notaries, and executors (court </p><p>officials charged with ensuring that sentences are carried </p><p>out and that appeals are handled correctly). </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U)  Dr. Thu said roughly 60 per cent of course </p><p>graduates had already been appointed to the bench.  The </p><p>aspiring judges spend eight months in the classroom.  Almost </p><p>all of this time is devoted to the Criminal Procedures Code </p><p>and on case studies based on it, as well as on </p><p>practicalities such as how to issue an arrest warrant. </p><p>According to Dr. Thu (who matriculated at a French law </p><p>school), the case study method used borrows elements from </p><p>France, Japan, Germany, and the U.S.  Students then intern </p><p>for two and a half months at a court in their home province, </p><p>and devote the final month to preparing for and taking the </p><p>final exam.  Apparently, nearly everyone passes. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U)  Dr. Thu claimed his school had already made </p><p>important contributions to improving the quality of new </p><p>judges, attorneys, and other court officials.  However, he </p><p>expressed regret that the school is still unable to provide </p><p>in-service training for existing judges -- many of whom have </p><p>had little or no formal academic training.  Nor has the </p><p>school provided training for specialized judges serving in </p><p>the Labor or Economic Courts.  Management of trials is not </p><p>part of the curriculum, and very little attention is given </p><p>to the role of the judge. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>Other Training for Court and Procuracy Officials </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U)  The Supreme People\'s Court (SPC) and the Supreme </p><p>People\'s Procuracy (SPP) also manage separate schools </p><p>providing professional training for their respective staffs. </p><p>The SPC training school, established in 1994, is a modest </p><p>affair with just a few rotating trainers, providing only </p><p>short-term training.  Serving judges teach the courses. </p><p>Some courses cover relevant laws for judges newly assigned </p><p>to various specialized courts.  There are also general in- </p><p>service training courses lasting one to two months that </p><p>include topics ranging from how to interpret laws to </p><p>courtroom management.  A main focus has been to provide at </p><p>least some training for pre-1990 appointees who often have </p><p>little or no formal training.  SPC officials say that they </p><p>would like to expand the school, currently housed in four or </p><p>five dilapidated rooms of the SPC building in Hanoi, to </p><p>provide more thorough training, but lament that there is no </p><p>funding to do so. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U)  The SPP runs two "colleges" -- in Ho Chi Minh City </p><p>and in Hanoi -- providing both short-term and long-term </p><p>training for prosecutors and other Procuracy staff.  The </p><p>colleges no longer offer bachelor\'s degree programs but </p><p>instead offer a one-year intensive course for Procuracy </p><p>employees who already have bachelor\'s degrees in law.  This </p><p>certificate is now a requirement for appointment as a </p><p>prosecutor. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>A National Judicial Academy? </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  (U)  According to Director Thu of the MOJ training </p><p>school, discussions are underway on the establishment of a </p><p>national judicial academy to provide advanced training for </p><p>all types of court officials, merging the separate </p><p>institutes under the Ministry of Justice, the Supreme </p><p>People\'s Court, and the Supreme People\'s Procuracy.  At </p><p>present, the differing approaches of these schools </p><p>reportedly have led to a less than harmonious approach to </p><p>legal training.  Thu said he personally favored putting the </p><p>academy under the Ministry of Justice. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (U)  Le Huu The, Director of the SPP Procuratorial </p><p>Science Institute, and Nguyen Van Don, Director of the Hanoi </p><p>Procuracy College, separately dismissed the necessity of </p><p>making their training institutions part of a bigger academy. </p><p>Both pointed out that the training of employees must be in </p><p>line with the Procuracy\'s overall personnel plan and </p><p>underscored their discomfort with the idea of the MOJ </p><p>running an institution that would train Procuracy staff. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (U)  Deputy Director Ngo Cuong of the SPC Judicial </p><p>Science Institute also voiced doubts that the MOJ would do a </p><p>good job running such an institution.  Cuong criticized the </p><p>current MOJ training school for being already unable to meet </p><p>the needs of its students and their employers.  Cuong </p><p>claimed that the school\'s curriculum was too focused on how </p><p>to carry out procedural functions such as issuing documents. </p><p>According to Cuong, "most of the students in classes for </p><p>judges have long worked as clerks of court.  They should </p><p>already know court procedures very well."  Cuong criticized </p><p>the MOJ school for failing to provide practical training on </p><p>how to run a courtroom and how to deal with actual cases. </p><p>He admitted that the MOJ school is useful for training </p><p>notaries and executors, and perhaps even attorneys, but </p><p>asserted that the SPC should take the lead in both long- and </p><p>short-term professional training for judges. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>15.  (U)  However the GVN decides to train judges, part of </p><p>their training must be to develop the role of the judge as </p><p>an impartial "moderator" between prosecutor and defense </p><p>attorney.  Officials such as the SPC\'s Cuong recognize this </p><p>and complain that current training neglects this aspect of a </p><p>judge\'s work and perpetuates the dominant role of the </p><p>prosecutor in the courtroom, where approximately 95 pct of </p><p>all cases end in conviction.  (Even higher during the just- </p><p>concluded Nam Cam case.)  Common wisdom in Vietnam holds </p><p>that prosecutors and judges generally determine the outcomes </p><p>of trials before they even begin.  One attorney claimed that </p><p>judges have been known to ask defendants questions such as, </p><p>"When did you commit the crime?" </p><p> </p><p>16.  (U)  CPV and GVN officials have spoken of the need for </p><p>speeding up Vietnam judicial reform process for several </p><p>years, and have prioritized upgrading the capabilities of </p><p>judges and other court officials.  This will require not </p><p>only elevating the role and responsibility of judges, but </p><p>also allowing defense attorneys to operate on a more </p><p>genuinely equal footing with prosecutors (septel).  It will </p><p>require years to develop genuinely knowledgeable judges and </p><p>defense attorneys, as well as to overcome a legal culture </p><p>dominated by prosecutors and police. </p><p> </p><p>17.  (U)  Some USG assistance is already underway toward the </p><p>goal of improving the quality of judges through mechanisms </p><p>such as the USAID-funded STAR program (in support of U.S.- </p><p>Vietnam Bilateral Trade Agreement implementation), the U.S.- </p><p>Vietnam Trade Council BTA and legal curriculum programs, and </p><p>PAS International Visitors programs.  The UNDP Legal Needs </p><p>Assessment (ref d) targets areas for foreign technical </p><p>assistance, including strengthening the legal education </p><p>system.  Vietnamese judges, from Presiding Judge of the </p><p>Supreme People\'s Court Nguyen Van Hien on down, have </p><p>expressed strong interest in learning more about the U.S. </p><p>court system.  A delegation from the Supreme People\'s Court, </p><p>possibly led by Justice Hien, is planning to visit the U.S. </p><p>in summer 2003 under the auspices of the STAR program. </p><p>PORTER </p><p></p></div>
