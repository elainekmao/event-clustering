<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 001036 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/23/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PTER, PINR, NP, Government of Nepal (GON) </p><p>SUBJECT: FINANCE MINISTER RESIGNS IN ANGER, BUT HOPES TO </p><p>HEAL PARTY RIFT </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. KATHMANDU 1007 </p><p> </p><p>     B. KATHMANDU 1005 </p><p>     C. KATHMANDU 740 (EXDIS) </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Michael E. Malinowski, Reasons 1.5(b),(d) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary.  Three Ministers resigned May 23 because the </p><p>Prime Minister had not consulted them on the decision to </p><p>suspend Parliament, Finance Minister Mahat told Ambassador </p><p>May 24.  Even so, Mahat said he was prepared to stay in the </p><p>Cabinet under the right conditions.  Mahat was especially </p><p>bitter because of his efforts in support of the PM\'s </p><p>policies.  The rift in the Nepali Congress Party (NCP) would </p><p>have to be mended, but antipathy between Deuba and a faction </p><p>opposed to him would make this difficult.  Holding elections </p><p>would be a challenge under current security conditions, Mahat </p><p>added.  In the past Deuba had had difficulty fighting an </p><p>entrenched and corrupt party machine.  Things seemed to be </p><p>going Deuba\'s way May 24 as 33 Ministers came out with a </p><p>statement of support and senior stateman K.P. Bhattarai </p><p>indicated he would work to heal the ruling party rift.  A </p><p>split in the NCP would almost certainly mean a loss to the </p><p>main opposition party in the next election.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>FinMin Bitter About Not Being Consulted </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Although he blamed former Prime Minister G.P. Koirala </p><p>for precipitating the crisis, Finance Minister Mahat decided </p><p>to resign because Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba had not </p><p>consulted him on the decision to dissolve Parliament, Mahat </p><p>told Ambassador May 24.  Mahat called the Embassy to speak to </p><p>the Ambassador the day after he and two other Ministers </p><p>tendered their resignations.  (Note:  As of COB May 24 the </p><p>King had not yet accepted their resignations and thus they </p><p>remained as Ministers.  According to an aide to the PM, Deuba </p><p>himself had not yet officially accepted the offers to resign, </p><p>and was holding them in his pocket.  End Note.)  The PM had </p><p>not consulted Parliament either on the decision to dissolve, </p><p>Mahat noted.  Mahat indicated that he would be willing to </p><p>stay in the cabinet provided that the other Ministers were </p><p>"serious people" and he got party permission, as he would </p><p>lose his party ticket without it. </p><p> </p><p>This Is How You Repay Me? </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) As a member of the NPC Central Working Committee </p><p>(CWC), Mahat had supported Deuba against Koirala in that </p><p>body.  Then he joined Deuba when the Cabinet had backed the </p><p>PM\'s recommendation to extend the state of emergency.  Mahat </p><p>was bitter that - after supporting Deuba to such a degree - </p><p>he had not been consulted on the decision to dissolve </p><p>Parliament.  (Note:  One news report on the press conference </p><p>where Mahat announced his resignation said he was in "an </p><p>aggressive mood."  End Note.)  Mahat was not aware of any </p><p>analysis or consultations done beforehand on the subject of </p><p>dissolving Parliament.  (Note:  Post caught wind of Deuba\'s </p><p>musings about whether to dissolve Parliament six weeks ago </p><p>(Ref C).  Note.)  The main problem was that Deuba tried to </p><p>please everyone, Mahat judged.  The PM was sincere, but had a </p><p>"weak temperament."  In passing, the FinMin also expressed </p><p>bitterness about Deuba\'s failure to support his proposals in </p><p>Parliament and about instances when the PM overruled him. </p><p> </p><p>Mahat:  Patch Up Ruling Party Rift </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The rift in the Nepali Congress Party would have to be </p><p>patched up, Mahat believed.  If Deuba were removed from the </p><p>NCP, he would have no locus of power within it and no power </p><p>base.  Deuba could try to form an alternative party, but </p><p>constitutional and regulatory obstacles made it difficult to </p><p>create a new national party.  Furthermore, Deuba was not the </p><p>charismatic type who could pull it off.  Party history and </p><p>symbolism was very important in Nepal, Mahat concluded. </p><p>(Note:  Party symbols are especially important in a society </p><p>where nearly half the population is illiterate.  End Note.) </p><p>Efforts to mend fences would be hampered by an element within </p><p>the NCP who were set on destroying him, Mahat went on.  Even </p><p>so, Mahat felt that Koriala\'s image had been "sullied" </p><p>because people blame him for forcing the PM\'s decision to </p><p>dissolve Parliament. </p><p> </p><p>Elections a Question Mark </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) The PM\'s desire to extend the emergency due to </p><p>security reasons contradicted his claim that elections could </p><p>be held within six months, Mahat said.  Mahat noted that </p><p>local-body elections could not even be held, even though the </p><p>terms of local officials expire in about a month.  Mahat </p><p>mused about possible fears that the military and/or palace, </p><p>in league with the Deuba faction, could try to manipulate the </p><p>elections. </p><p> </p><p>A System Hard to Fight </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Mahat agreed that Nepal\'s political system was flawed </p><p>in that the parties played too great a role in dictating </p><p>policy and - more egregiously - in forcing the government to </p><p>dispense patronage.  Unfortunately that was the reality in </p><p>Nepal, Mahat added.  He judged that PM Deuba was not an </p><p>effective leader and thus could not stand up to the party </p><p>machine.  For example, although Deuba was decidedly opposed </p><p>to corruption, Mahat watched as time and again he gave in to </p><p>party pressure to appoint people to high office who were </p><p>either novices or corrupt.  On the corruption count, Mahat </p><p>mentioned the new Chief Secretary, most public corporation </p><p>heads and the Royal Nepal Airlines Corporation (RNAC) </p><p>Chairman as examples. </p><p> </p><p>Going Deuba\'s Way </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) After Mahat\'s morning call, signs began to appear that </p><p>things may be starting to shift Deuba\'s way.  In the </p><p>afternoon Nepal\'s state radio reported that 33 out of 41 </p><p>Ministers had signed a letter to the PM saying they "fully </p><p>supported" him.  Former Prime Minister and current MP Krishna </p><p>Prasad Bhattarai, the only surviving founding member of the </p><p>NCP, returned to the capital from medical treatment abroad </p><p>and said he would participate in the new elections.  This was </p><p>widely viewed as a statement of support for Deuba.  Bhattarai </p><p>planned to meet separately with Deuba and Koirala May 25, </p><p>and, according to a close advisor, would ask Koirala to </p><p>withdraw Deuba\'s suspension from the party.  (Note:  On May </p><p>23 the NCP CWC suspended Deuba\'s party membership and asked </p><p>him to provide, within three days, an explanation of his </p><p>decision to dissolve Parliament.  Deuba was not, however, </p><p>thrown out of the party, as erroneously reported in Ref B. </p><p>End Note.)  One member of Nepal\'s upper house viewed with </p><p>significance the fact that no other Ministers had resigned </p><p>despite Koirala\'s calls that they do so. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) The situtation in Nepal remains extremely fluid but it </p><p>is now clear that Deuba has managed to raise a </p><p>counter-attack.  Events on May 24 seemed to be going his way. </p><p> Comments by elder statesman K.P. Bhattarai - a long-time </p><p>Koirala rival - were especially helpful to Deuba.  The cost </p><p>of a split within the NCP will likely be a certain loss in </p><p>the elections to the leading opposition party.  With </p><p>Bhattarai standing by to mend fences, the NCP may yet be able </p><p>to resurrect itself. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
