<p>UNCLAS ANKARA 001473 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, P, EUR/SE AND EB </p><p>TREASURY FOR U/S TAYLOR AND OASIA - MILLS </p><p>NSC FOR QUANRUD AND BRYZA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EINV, ECON, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR RAISES FOREIGN INVESTMENT ISSUES WITH </p><p>FINANCE MINISTER, WHO AGREES TO MEET WITH U.S. COLA </p><p>COMPANIES </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but unclassified, and not for internet </p><p>distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) AMB paid an office call on Finance Minister Kemal </p><p>Unakitan March 7 largely to discuss the status of the 2003 </p><p>budget (septel).   AMB also raised the need to improve the </p><p>foreign investment climate in Turkey, and wanted to cite </p><p>several examples. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) AMB said the Citibank General Manager in Turkey had </p><p>praised Unakitan\'s instrumental role in resolving a tax issue </p><p>involving Citibank\'s foreign portfolio investors.  AMB said </p><p>he wanted to add his appreciation to the minister.  His </p><p>intervention had allowed Citibank\'s important economic </p><p>activity in Turkey to continue.  Unakitan, clearly pleased, </p><p>said he was only doing his job. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) AMB then raised the long-standing tax treatment of </p><p>cola beverage producers. AMB stressed the differing tax </p><p>treatment of Cola versus other beverages, and how the 48 </p><p>percent tax rate on cola was stifling investment and limiting </p><p>employment in this field.  Unakitan replied that he was aware </p><p>of the problem.  He had met with U.S. cola companies briefly </p><p>at Davos in January.  He told the AMB he would meet the cola </p><p>companies in Ankara and give the problem a more extended </p><p>hearing.  AMB thanked him and said he would pass this onto </p><p>the U.S. cola producers. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
