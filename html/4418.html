AKP WANTS ELECTIONS CANCELLED IN SIIRT </p><p>(Sabah/Milli Gazete)  AKP petitioned the Higher </p><p>Election Council (YSK) to cancel the elections in </p><p>Siirt due to lack of a ballot council in a Pervari </p><p>(Siirt) village where 700 voters were unable to vote. </p><p>If YSK cancels the elections there, AKP will </p><p>reportedly nominate AKP chairman Recep Tayyip Erdogan </p><p>from Siirt if his political ban is lifted. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  RIGHTS VIOLATIONS IN THE SOUTHEAST </p><p>(Evrensel)  The Diyarbakir Chapter of the Human Rights </p><p>Association (HRA) issued a report regarding violations </p><p>experienced during the November 3 parliamentary </p><p>elections.  The report claimed the Democratic People\'s </p><p>Party (DEHAP) was the only political party which </p><p>suffered from rights violations in the region. </p><p>According to the report, DEHAP observers were not </p><p>allowed into schools (to watch vote casting), police </p><p>officers tore electorate information cards, voters </p><p>were subjected to such maltreatments as insults and </p><p>threats, and were forced to cast their votes openly. </p><p>HRA President Selahattin Demir indicated 310 rights </p><p>violations, including arrests, threats, preventions, </p><p>detentions, maltreatments, forcible open vote casting </p><p>and assaults took place in the region prior to and </p><p>during the elections.  Demir claimed village guards, </p><p>village chiefs, jandarma, tribal chiefs, and from time </p><p>to time political parties, had exercised pressure on </p><p>voters and accused them of election fraud. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  PKK ARRESTS CONTINUE </p><p>(Turkiye)  Gaziantep Security Directorate Anti-terror </p><p>squad arrested three PKK members who had received </p><p>training in a (PKK) camp in northern Iraq.  Police </p><p>found out that PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan, following </p><p>his capture, had ordered his less known members to go </p><p>to Turkey in order to incite the public to carry out </p><p>mass activities (demonstrations), recruit new members, </p><p>and stage civil disobedience.  The arrestees were </p><p>later arraigned in a local court and ordered to remain </p><p>in custody.  In a separate operation, Jandarma </p><p>arrested eleven people accused of assisting and </p><p>abetting the PKK in Diyarbakir\'s Lice and Hani </p><p>townships.  In Nusaybin (Mardin), police arrested PKK </p><p>member Ibrahim Tanhan while he was trying to take a </p><p>bag full of clothing to PKK members in rural areas.  A </p><p>local court later ordered Tanhan to remain in custody. </p><p>Van police seized one truck load of medical supplies </p><p>and equipment destined for PKK camps in Iran and </p><p>arrested four people in connection with the seizure. </p><p>Also, Hakkari Jandarma seized weapons associated with </p><p>the PKK during searches in rural Hakkari. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS AGAINST KURDISH PETITIONERS </p><p>REVERSED </p><p>(Evrensel)  The Van Administrative Court reversed </p><p>disciplinary actions given by Van\'s Centennial </p><p>University to 171 students for petitioning for an </p><p>elective course in Kurdish.  The reversal followed the </p><p>students\' appeal.  Also, the Adana Administrative </p><p>Court reversed the Cukurova University\'s (Adana) </p><p>decision to suspend and expel 54 students for </p><p>demanding education in Kurdish. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  KURDISH NAMING PROBLEMS CONTINUE </p><p>(Evrensel)  The Diyarbakir Birth Registry Directorate </p><p>denied a parent permission to give the name "Amed" to </p><p>his son.  The parent later petitioned the Prosecutor\'s </p><p>Office to allow him to give the name he wanted to his </p><p>child.  Lawsuits were opened against Mersin parent </p><p>Zeki Geris, who had given the non-Turkish names </p><p>"Baver" and "Xebat" to his twins, and parent Filiz </p><p>Coskun for having named her child "Siyar." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  REMAINS OF ANCIENT PROVINCE FOUND IN ADANA </p><p>(Bolge)  The remains of what used to be a Hittite </p><p>province were unearthed during archaeological </p><p>excavations carried out in Adana\'s Tufanbeyli </p><p>township.  Assistant Professor Serdar Girginer of </p><p>Cukurova University\'s (Adana) Archaeology Department </p><p>and his team carried out the excavations, which began </p><p>on August 20.  Girginer said studies showed Tufanbeyli </p><p>was the region\'s culture center in 2,000 B.C. </p><p>Girginer noted the project would expand to neighboring </p><p>provinces and last nearly five years. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ECONOMIC AND AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENTS </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.
