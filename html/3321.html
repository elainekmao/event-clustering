(C)  SUMMARY: CARDINAL WALTER KASPER, THE  VATICAN </p><p>OFFICIAL RESPONSIBLE FOR CHRISTIAN UNITY (INCLUDING THE </p><p>DIALOGUE WITH RUSSIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH) SAID THAT THE HOLY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  03527  01 OF 02  170549Z </p><p>SEE\'S ATTEMPTS AT DIALOGUE WITH THE RUSSIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH </p><p>(ROC) ARE IN A DIFFICULT MOMENT AND NOT ADVANCING.  KASPER </p><p>TOLD INCOMING DCM THAT THE ROC REMAINS TOO NATIONALISTIC AND </p><p>FALSELY PERCEIVES AS A THREAT THE TINY MINORITY OF CATHOLICS </p><p>IN RUSSIA -- JUST OVER 251,000 BAPTIZED CATHOLICS.  ACCORDING </p><p>TO KASPER, THE POPE IS NOW RESIGNED TO THE LIKELIHOOD THAT HE </p><p>WILL NEVER VISIT RUSSIA.  THE ROC NEVERTHELESS CONTINUES A </p><p>GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH VARIOUS CATHOLIC INDIVIDUALS AND </p><p>AGENCIES - NOTABLY THOSE THAT FUND ROC ACTIVITIES.  DESPITE </p><p>THE BECALMED HOLY SEE/ROC DIALOGUE, THE VATICAN WILL BE </p><p>PATIENT AND KEEP ITS DOORS OPEN TO COOPERATION WITH THE ROC </p><p>WHEREVER POSSIBLE. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>DIALOGUE RUNS AGROUND </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  INCOMING DCM PAID A CALL JULY 16 ON CARDINAL WALTER </p><p>KASPER, PREFECT OF THE PONTIFICAL COUNCIL FOR PROMOTING </p><p>CHRISTIAN UNITY.  QUERIED ON THE STATE OF CATHOLIC/RUSSIAN </p><p>ORTHODOX DIALOGUE, KASPER CONCEDED THAT IT WAS STALLED.  HE </p><p>SHARED VATICAN DFM  MIGLIORE\'S CONCERNS (REF B) AT THE GOR </p><p>REFUSAL OF VISAS TO CATHOLIC CLERGY -- ESPECIALLY BISHOP </p><p>MAZUR.  HE SAID THE HOLY SEE HAD SENT A FORMAL, WRITTEN QUERY </p><p>FROM THE POPE TO PRESIDENT PUTIN SIX WEEKS AGO ASKING FOR </p><p>CLARIFICATION OF THE GROUNDS OF THAT VISA REFUSAL, BUT AS OF </p><p>YET HAD HAD NO RESPONSE (SOMETHING HE CHARACTERIZED AS </p><p>EXTRAORDINARY, UNDIPLOMATIC AND IMPOLITE).  HE ALSO EXPRESSED </p><p>DISMAY AT THE RECENT HARSH RHETORIC COMING FROM THE RUSSIAN </p><p>PATRIARCH\'S SPOKESMAN ACCUSING THE CATHOLIC CHURCH OF </p><p>COMPETING WITH THE RUSSIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  03527  01 OF 02  170549Z </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>RUSSIAN FEARS, VATICAN ASSURANCES </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  CARDINAL KASPER SAID THAT THERE WERE MANY REASONS </p><p>FOR THE LACK OF PROGRESS IN HOLY SEE/RUSSIAN ORTHODOX </p><p>DIALOGUE: THE ROC IS "TOO NATIONALISTIC," UNFOUNDED FEARS OF </p><p>A CATHOLIC THREAT TO ROC POWER AND INFLUENCE FROM THE 251,000 </p><p>(BAPTIZED) CATHOLICS IN RUSSIA (VS. 105 MILLION RUSSIAN </p><p>CITIZENS), AND "HISTORICAL" CONCERNS RELATING TO </p><p>POLISH/RUSSIAN CONFLICTS IN CENTURIES PAST.   (NOTE: IN REF A </p><p>WE REPORTED VATICAN NIS COUNTRY DIRECTOR TRICARICO\'S MORE </p><p>UNVARNISHED ASSESSMENT: "THEY ARE ALL FORMER COLLABORATORS </p><p>WHO HAVEN\'T BEEN ABLE TO SHAKE OLD HABITS." END NOTE.) </p><p>KASPER REPEATED THE VATICAN ASSERTION THAT THE CATHOLIC </p><p>CHURCH ABSOLUTELY DOES NOT "PROSELYTIZE" IN RUSSIA.  HE SAID </p><p>THE CHURCH WOULD NOT TURN AWAY A RUSSIAN WHO IN GOOD </p><p>CONSCIENCE SOUGHT TO JOIN, AS THIS WAS A MATTER OF FREEDOM OF </p><p>RELIGION.  BUT HE POINTED OUT THAT EVEN THE NUNS WHO CARE FOR </p><p>RUSSIAN ORPHANS ENSURE THAT THOSE CHILDREN GO TO ORTHODOX, </p><p>NOT CATHOLIC, CHURCHES EVERY SUNDAY.  HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT </p><p>SOME CATHOLICS MAY HAVE BEEN OVERZEALOUS, AS WERE SOME </p><p>ORTHODOX.  BUT THAT WAS NOT VATICAN POLICY. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  KASPER EXPLAINED THAT THE RECENT CREATION OF FOUR </p><p>DIOCESES IN RUSSIA WAS NO MORE DECLARING RUSSIA TO BE </p><p>"VATICAN TERRITORY" THAN WAS DECLARING THE 300-PLUS DIOCESES </p><p>IN THE U.S.A. TO BE VATICAN TERRITORY.  HE SAID THE CHURCH </p><p>HAD AN APOSTOLIC ADMINISTRATION IN RUSSIA IN CZARIST TIMES. </p><p>THE RENEWED APOSTOLIC ADMINISTRATIONS IN RUSSIA AND UKRAINE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  03527  01 OF 02  170549Z </p><p>AFTER 1990 HAD ONLY BEEN TEMPORARY MEASURES.  ELEVATING THOSE </p><p>AREAS TO DIOCESES WAS NEEDED TO PROVIDE PASTORAL CARE TO THE </p><p>LARGELY ETHNIC POLES, LITHUANIAN, AND OTHER MINORITIES THAT </p><p>HAD BEEN DISPERSED THROUGHOUT THE SOVIET UNION BY STALIN. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>POPE GIVING UP HOPE ON A MOSCOW VISIT </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  ASKED WHETHER THE POPE STILL HOPED TO VISIT MOSCOW, </p><p>KASPER REPLIED THAT IN HIS VIEW THE POPE HAD COME TO TERMS </p><p>WITH THE FACT THAT HE WOULD NOT HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO MEET </p><p>WITH RUSSIAN PATRIARCH ALEXIY AND HAD GIVEN UP ON THAT </p><p>"DREAM."  IT WAS PARTICULARLY TROUBLING TO THE PONTIFF </p><p>BECAUSE HE HAD MET WITH ALL OF THE OTHER ORTHODOX PATRIARCHS </p><p>AND HAD BEGUN TO BUILD BRIDGES.  KASPER THOUGHT THAT AS </p><p>FELLOW SLAVS, THE POPE AND ALEXIY WOULD HAVE A COMMON </p><p>VOCABULARY FOR LAUNCHING AN HISTORIC RECONCILIATION.  ALAS, </p><p>IT NOW APPEARS THIS BRIDGE WOULD HAVE TO BE BUILT UNDER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ7778 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        VATICA  03527  02 OF 02  170550Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DODE-00  DS-00    VC-00 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   LAB-01   VCE-00   NSAE-00  SSO-00   SS-00 </p><p>      DSCC-00  DRL-02   SAS-00     /003W </p><p>                  ------------------CC3A4B  170550Z /38 </p><p>O 170552Z JUL 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY VATICAN </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>INFO EUROPEAN POLITICAL COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY MOSCOW PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 VATICAN 003527 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EUR/WE (MENNUTI), DRL/IRF (FARR) EUR/RUS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/16/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, KIRF, RU, VT </p><p>SUBJECT: VATICAN KEEPING "DOORS OPEN" TO RUSSIAN ORTHODOX </p><p>DESPITE CONTINUED TENSIONS </p><p> </p><p>DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C)  NOTWITHSTANDING CURRENT OBSTACLES, KASPER MADE CLEAR </p><p>THAT THE CHURCH WOULD BE PATIENT AND "KEEP ITS DOORS OPEN TO </p><p>THE ORTHODOX."  KASPER NOTED (INNOCENTLY RATHER THAN </p><p>IRONICALLY) THAT ALTHOUGH THE RUSSIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH WON\'T </p><p>TALK TO THE HOLY SEE, IT DOES HAVE FRUITFUL CONTACTS WITH </p><p>CATHOLIC INDIVIDUALS AND AGENCIES -- ESPECIALLY THOSE, LIKE </p><p>THE SEVERAL GERMAN CHURCH FUNDING AGENCIES, WHICH PROVIDE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  03527  02 OF 02  170550Z </p><p>MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR ROC OPERATIONS AND ASSISTANCE.  HE </p><p>ALSO NOTED THE CATHOLIC/ORTHODOX DIALOGUE WORKS WELL IN </p><p>WESTERN COUNTRIES, WHICH KASPER ASCRIBED TO A MORE MODERN AND </p><p>OPEN WORLDVIEW OF MOST CITIZENS IN THE WEST. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) KASPER\'S ASSERTION THAT THE POPE HAD GIVEN UP ON </p><p>VISITING MOSCOW WAS THE STRONGEST AFFIRMATION WE HAVE HAD </p><p>FROM A SENIOR CURIAL OFFICIAL THAT THE POPE HAS ACCEPTED THE </p><p>PROBABILITY THAT HE WILL NOT FULFILL HIS VISION OF OUTREACH </p><p>TO THE RUSSIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH.  HE CONVEYED A STRONG SENSE </p><p>THAT HE AND THE POPE WERE TROUBLED BY THE HARDNESS OF RUSSIAN </p><p>ORTHODOX ATTITUDES, AND THAT HE WAS UNCERTAIN HOW TO OVERCOME </p><p>THEM.  "IF PUTIN AND BUSH CAN COME TOGETHER," HE WONDERED, </p><p>"WHY CAN\'T THE PATRIARCH AND THE POPE?"  KASPER AGREED THAT </p><p>CHANGES WOULD PROBABLY COME ONLY WHEN RUSSIA WAS BETTER </p><p>INTEGRATED WITH THE WEST AND HAD COME TO ACCEPT WESTERN NORMS </p><p>ON FREEDOM OF RELIGION. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) COMMENT CONTINUED:  THE COUNCIL FOR PROMOTING </p><p>CHRISTIAN UNITY ORIGINATED IN THE VATICAN II REFORMS AND IS </p><p>RESPONSIBLE FOR PROMOTING DIALOGUE AND MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING </p><p>WITH OTHER CHRISTIAN DENOMINATIONS AS WELL AS WITH THE JEWISH </p><p>FAITH.  CONSERVATIVES WITHIN THE ROMAN CURIA BELIEVE THE IDEA </p><p>OF DIALOGUE AS EQUALS WITH OTHER DENOMINATIONS VIOLATES CORE </p><p>PRECEPTS OF CATHOLICISM, AND THUS THEY ARE EQUIVOCAL ABOUT </p><p>THE COUNCIL\'S WORK.  KASPER IS AN IMPORTANT THINKER ON THE </p><p>CHURCH\'S ROLE IN THE WORLD, AND FREQUENTLY ADDRESSES THE NEED </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  03527  02 OF 02  170550Z </p><p>FOR BROADER DIALOGUE AMONG DIFFERENT FAITHS -- WHICH IS </p><p>TECHNICALLY OUTSIDE OF HIS BRIEF.  OUR SANT\'EGIDIO FRIENDS, </p><p>WHO HELP ORGANIZE THE POPE\'S EPISODIC INTERFAITH DAYS OF </p><p>PRAYER (MOST RECENTLY IN ASSISI IN JANUARY), TELL US THEY </p><p>BELIEVE KASPER IS ONE OF THE FEW SENIOR CURIA OFFICIALS WHO </p><p>"GET IT" ON INTERFAITH DIALOGUE AND THE NEED TO TALK TO EVEN </p><p>THE MOST DIFFICULT INTERLOCUTORS IF THE CHURCH IS TO AVOID </p><p>THE MUCH FEARED "CLASH OF CIVILIZATIONS."  END COMMENT. </p><p>HARDT </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> </p><p></p><p> 2002VATICA03527 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
