CONFIDENTIAL -- ENTIRE TEXT </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  WHILE THE CROATIAN POLITICAL OPPOSITION HAS MOSTLY </p><p>FALLEN IN BEHIND THE GOVERNMENT\'S POSITION ON TERMINATING </p><p>THE UNPROFOR MANDATE HERE, SOME PARTIES, INCLUDING THE </p><p>SERBIAN PEOPLE\'S PARTY (SNS), THE ISTRIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY </p><p>(IDS) AND THE CROATIAN INDEPENDENT DEMOCRATS (HND) HAVE </p><p>POINTED OUT THE DANGERS THAT THE GOC DECISION ON UNPROFOR </p><p>WILL MEAN FOR CROATIA.  THESE THREE PARTIES HAVE NOT </p><p>BOUGHT INTO THE NATIONALISTIC RHETORIC THAT HAS BEEN </p><p>ECHOED BY THE OTHER OPPOSITION PARTIES AND HDZ, AND WHICH </p><p>HAS CLOUDED THE PROPOSALS FOR AUTONOMY FOUND IN THE Z-4 </p><p>PLAN.  HND OFFICIALS CONSIDER THE Z-4 PLAN TO BE A SOUND </p><p>BASIS FOR FURTHER TALKS.  THE IDS CHAMPIONS REGIONAL </p><p>AUTONOMY, BUT IS CONCERNED THAT THE Z-4 PLAN WOULD GRANT </p><p>AUTONOMY TO SERBS WHILE OTHER ETHNIC GROUPS MUST LIVE WITH </p><p>CENTRALIZED AUTHORITY IN ZAGREB.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>CROATIAN INDEPENDENT DEMOCRATS (HND) </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00817  01 OF 02  231647Z </p><p> </p><p>3.  ON FEBRUARY 22 THE AMBASSADOR MET WITH STIPE MESIC, </p><p>PRESIDENT OF THE CROATIAN INDEPENDENT DEMOCRATS (HND) WHO </p><p>SAID THAT HE CONSIDERS THE Z-4 PLAN TO BE A SOUND BASIS </p><p>FOR FURTHER TALKS.  BROAD AUTONOMY AND DEMILITARIZATION, </p><p>HE BELIEVES, ARE A NECESSARY CONFIDENCE BUILDING MEASURE </p><p>FOR SERBS TO AGREE TO REINTEGRATION.  HE CITED EVIDENCE OF </p><p>CROATIAN WAR CRIMES -- THE PLANNED DESTRUCTION OF SERB </p><p>HOUSES AND THE INABILITY OF THE POLICE TO FIND THE </p><p>PERPETRATORS, AS WELL AS THE ALLEGED INVOLVEMENT OF </p><p>TUDJMAN\'S CHIEF BODYGUARD IN THE MURDER OF A SERB FAMILY </p><p>IN THE ZAGREB SUBURBS -- AS A MAJOR FACTOR IN SERB </p><p>DISTRUST OF THE GOC.  HE SAID THAT THE GOC ATTEMPT TO </p><p>LIMIT THE RIGHT TO DUAL CITIZENSHIP TO CROATS ONLY IS </p><p>UNWORKABLE, THAT RIGHT MUST BE APPLIED TO SERBS, ITALIANS, </p><p>AND OTHER MINORITIES ON AN EQUAL BASIS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  MESIC THINKS TUDJMAN WILL CONSIDER A REVISED UNPROFOR </p><p>MANDATE (UNDER A DIFFERENT NAME) WHEN HE REALIZES THAT </p><p>MILOSEVIC IS PLAYING TRICKS.  MESIC SAID THAT TUDJMAN\'S </p><p>VISION OF AN ETHNICALLY PURE GREATER CROATIA IS </p><p>FUNDAMENTALLY AT ODDS WITH MILOSEVIC\'S GREATER SERBIA. </p><p>MESIC THOUGHT THAT A NEW MANDATE WOULD BUILD TRUST BETWEEN </p><p>SERBS AND CROATS AND FACILITATE REINTEGRATION IF IT </p><p>PROVIDED A SECURE ENVIRONMENT FOR CROATIA\'S SERBS AND THE </p><p>RETURN OF DISPLACED PERSONS, AS WELL AS ESTABLISHED </p><p>CONTROL OF CROATIA\'S BORDERS.  HE VIEWED TERMINATION OF </p><p>THE MANDATE AS A POINTLESS MOVE WHICH WOULD SERVE TO UNDO </p><p>ALL THE GAINS ACHIEVED UNDER THE ECONOMIC CONFIDENCE </p><p>BUILDING MEASURES AGREEMENT BETWEEN ZAGREB AND KNIN. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00817  01 OF 02  231647Z </p><p>5.  IN ONE OF THE FEW FAVORABLE PRESS ARTICLES, PUBLISHED </p><p>IN THE WEEKLY "GLOBUS," HND VICE PRESIDENT JOSIP MANOLIC </p><p>WROTE THAT Z-4 IS THE "MOST SERIOUS INTERNATIONAL DOCUMENT </p><p>OFFERING A SOLUTION TO THE CRISIS IN CROATIA."  HE WAS </p><p>CRITICAL OF THE GOC FOR NOT PROPOSING THEIR OWN PLAN, </p><p>WHICH WAS EMPHASIZED BY MESIC WHEN HE TOLD THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>THAT THE GOC SHOULD HAVE HAD SOMETHING TO FILL THE VOID </p><p>WHEN THEY CANCELLED THE UNPROFOR MANDATE.  MANOLIC </p><p>CRITICIZED THE VIEW THAT Z-4 WOULD CREATE A STATE WITHIN A </p><p>STATE, WRITING THAT, IN HIS OPINION, CONSTITUTIONAL LAW </p><p>GIVES THE SERBS THE RIGHT TO HAVE ADMINISTRATIVE AND COURT </p><p>AUTHORITY AS WELL AS PARLIAMENTARY INSTITUTIONS TO PASS </p><p>LEGISLATION ON ISSUES OF LOCAL AUTONOMY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>ISTRIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY (IDS) </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>6.  THE IDS HAS LONG BEEN A CHAMPION OF REGIONAL AUTONOMY, </p><p>BUT IS UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THE Z-4 PLAN\'S GRANTING LOCAL </p><p>AUTONOMY ONLY TO SERBS.

THE </p><p>MAIN ISSUE ON THE AGENDA WAS THE RECENT RULING AGAINST </p><p>REGIONAL AUTONOMY BY THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT WHICH STRUCK </p><p>DOWN 19 PROVISIONS OF THE ISTRIAN COUNTY STATUTE </p><p>PERTAINING TO OFFICIAL USE OF THE ITALIAN LANGUAGE AND </p><p>DECENTRALIZATION OF LOCAL ADMINISTRATION. </p><p> </p><p>7.  SOLDATIC SAID THAT THE IDS\'S OPTIONS TO CHANGE THE </p><p>COURT\'S DECISION ARE LIMITED.  THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT\'S </p><p>RULING WAS FINAL AND THERE WAS NO AVENUE FOR PURSUING AN </p><p>APPEAL.  IDS, HOWEVER, WILL CONTINUE TO LOBBY THE SABOR </p><p>FOR CHANGES IN THE CONSTITUTION.  BEYOND THAT THE IDS WILL </p><p>TRY TO REFORMULATE SOME STATUTES INTO SOMETHING ACCEPTABLE </p><p>TO THE GOC AND CONTINUE TO TEST THE LAW TO SEE HOW MUCH </p><p>AUTONOMY ZAGREB WILL ALLOW.  THEY ADDED, HOWEVER, THAT NOT </p><p>ONLY COULD THE DECISION PROVIDE MOTIVATION TO ANTI-CROAT </p><p>EXTREMISTS IN BOTH ITALY AND ISTRIA TO PURSUE MORE VOCAL </p><p>CAMPAIGNS FOR SEPARATISM AND BORDER CHANGES, BUT IT ALSO </p><p>DID NOT BODE WELL FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF GOC CONCESSIONS </p><p>TO KNIN. </p><p> </p><p>8.  ALONG WITH THE SNS, IDS UNANIMOUSLY OPPOSED </p><p>TERMINATION OF THE UNPROFOR MANDATE.  IN PRIVATE JAKOVCIC </p><p>SAID THAT THE GOC DECISION ON UNPROFOR AND THE "RSK\'S" </p><p>REFUSAL TO EVEN LOOK AT THE Z-4 PLAN MADE HIM, FOR THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00817  02 OF 02  231648Z </p><p>FIRST TIME, "REALLY SCARED FOR THE FUTURE."  BOTH SIDES </p><p>HAD TAKEN EXTREME POSITIONS WHICH WERE NOT EASY TO BACK </p><p>DOWN FROM, AND THE GOC WAS NOT FACING UP TO THE </p><p>POSSIBILITY THAT IT COULD LOSE A WAR WITH THE "RSK," </p><p>ESPECIALLY WITH BSA AND FRY SUPPORT.  HE SAID HE HAD </p><p>CONSIDERED THE IDEA OF OFFERING TO LEAD A GROUP OF </p><p>OPPOSITION LEADERS TO KNIN IN AN EFFORT TO RESTART </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS, BUT ADMITTED THAT THE IDEA HAD PROBLEMS (FOR </p><p>INSTANCE, WHAT WOULD THEY DO IF GREETED WITH THE "RSK" </p><p>FLAG AND ANTHEM).  ALSO, OTHER OPPOSITION PARTIES PROBABLY </p><p>WOULD NOT SUPPORT SUCH A MOVE BECAUSE MANY ARE SUPPORTING </p><p>THE GOC POSITION. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>CROATIAN PEASANTS PARTY (HSS) </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  THE HSS TYPIFIES THE STANCE ASSUMED BY MOST OF THE </p><p>REST OF THE OPPOSITION.  NEW HSS PRESIDENT ZLATKO TOMCIC, </p><p>IN A CALL ON THE AMBASSADOR NOVEMBER 8, SAID THAT THE HSS </p><p>SUPPORTED THE GOC DECISION TO TERMINATE THE UNPROFOR </p><p>MANDATE, BUT THEY WOULD SUPPORT A REVISION OF THE MANDATE </p><p>(UNDER A DIFFERENT NAME) IF IT PROVIDED GUARANTEES TO </p><p>CONTROL CROATIA\'S BORDERS.  TOMCIC SAID THAT IN GENERAL </p><p>THE HSS SUPPORTS THE Z-4 PLAN AS A BASIS FOR DISCUSSION </p><p>BUT HAD SERIOUS RESERVATIONS, PARTICULARLY ON THE ISSUE OF </p><p>TIES TO SERBIA.  TOMCIC CLAIMED THE HSS WAS IN FAVOR OF </p><p>ADMINISTRATIVE AUTONOMY FOR THE SERBS, BUT WHEN ASKED BY </p><p>THE AMBASSADOR IF THIS MEANT THAT SERBS COULD PURCHASE, </p><p>FOR EXAMPLE, SCHOOL TEXTBOOKS FROM SERBIA, TOMCIC </p><p>ANSWERED, "ABSOLUTELY NOT."  A FLUSTERED SILENCE ENSUED </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00817  02 OF 02  231648Z </p><p>WHEN THE AMBASSADOR POINTED OUT THAT THAT WOULD DENY </p><p>AUTONOMY TO THE SERBS. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  THE ATTITUDE OF THE HND AND IDS (AND SNS) -- THIRD, </p><p>AND, ROUGHLY, SIXTH LARGEST PARTIES IN THE SABOR -- IS A </p><p>SMALL HOPEFUL SIGN THAT ATTITUDES AMONG THE OPPOSITION\'S </p><p>CONSTITUENCIES HAVE NOT SOLIDIFIED AGAINST SERB AUTONOMY </p><p>AND THE Z-4.  THERE ARE AT LEAST A FEW VOICES CHALLENGING </p><p>TUDJMAN\'S RATHER UNREALISTIC ASSESSMENT OF WHAT UNPROFOR\'S </p><p>DEPARTURE WILL MEAN FOR CROATIA. </p><p> </p><p>GALBRAITH </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p></p></div>
