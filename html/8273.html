<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 000945 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O.12958: DECL: 1.6x1 </p><p>TAGS: CASC, ASEC, PREL, PTER, EPET, NI </p><p>SUBJECT:  Evaluating the Terrorist Threat to U.S. Oil </p><p>Workers in Nigeria </p><p> </p><p>Ref: TD 315/21866-03 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter.  Reason: </p><p>1.5(c) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) The Mission understands that consideration </p><p>is being given to issuing a revised travel warning for </p><p>Nigeria to make specific mention of a possible </p><p>terrorist threat to U.S. oil facilities in Nigeria. </p><p>Given the dated and speculative nature of the possible </p><p>threat, the Mission strongly urges the Department to </p><p>consider carefully and fully the implications of </p><p>taking such an action. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) The Mission\'s two EACs (Embassy Abuja and </p><p>Consulate General Lagos) met during the week of May </p><p>19, and concluded that the information contained in </p><p>the referenced report did not warrant issuance of a </p><p>warden message or revision of the existing travel </p><p>warning for Nigeria to make specific mention of a </p><p>possible terrorist threat to oil facilities.  U.S. oil </p><p>companies operating in Nigeria and American citizens </p><p>living here are acutely aware of security issues, and </p><p>possible threat emanating from within and outside </p><p>Nigeria.  The possibility of an attack similar to </p><p>those perpetrated against the U.S.S. Cole and the </p><p>French tanker is clear to U.S. oil company managers, </p><p>and they ensure security awareness of their personnel </p><p>through in-house newsletters, emails, and other media. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) The oil-producing Niger Delta is a rough </p><p>neighborhood.  Security incidents involving aggrieved </p><p>Nigerian employees or disaffected local inhabitants </p><p>are not unusual.  U.S. and other companies operating </p><p>in the area maintain a constant state of vigilance. </p><p>While a terrorist attack would be qualitatively </p><p>different from an extortion attempt, many of the </p><p>measures a company would take to deter the former are </p><p>the same as those that would be taken to reduce the </p><p>chances of the latter.  And, again, the companies are </p><p>aware that their facilities could be the target of a </p><p>terrorist attack. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S/NF) Let us be clear about the quality and </p><p>timeliness of the information contained in the </p><p>referenced intelligence.  The source is someone whose </p><p>reliability is unknown and who might have reason to </p><p>confuse or misdirect us.  Moreover, the source </p><p>"recently recalled" a conversation from the year 2000 </p><p>that the source had with a senior Al-Qaida figure, in </p><p>which the senior Al-Qaida figure said he had sent </p><p>someone to Nigeria for an unspecified purpose that </p><p>might have been surveillance of oil installations. </p><p>The source does not know that the Al-Qaida envoy </p><p>conducted any surveillance in Nigeria, much less that </p><p>the target of the surveillance (if there was any) was </p><p>oil installations.  All the source really knows (if </p><p>the source is reliable, and, of course, we do not know </p><p>that) is that the journey took 45 days. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) The crucial question we need to ask is: </p><p>"What do we know as a result of this new information </p><p>that we did not know before?"  We in the Mission do </p><p>not believe we know anything more of substance.  The </p><p>follow-on question would be:  "What can we say to the </p><p>oil companies that would help them be better prepared </p><p>than they already are for a possible attack?"  We in </p><p>the Mission believe they are already as prepared as </p><p>the state of our current knowledge would warrant; we </p><p>should not unnerve them with speculation cloaked in </p><p>the guise of actionable intelligence, especially </p><p>intelligence that gathered nearly three year ago. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) In an email dated 24 May 2003, DS/ITA said it </p><p>"strongly feels that updating the travel warning </p><p>solely / solely on this one threat report would not / </p><p>not be sound.  Not appropriate.  ...it was confirmed </p><p>that the threat information was outdated and very </p><p>speculative in nature.  However, DS/ITA does feel </p><p>(stating the obvious) that U.S. oil companies / </p><p>offshore oil rigs in Nigeria will always be "high </p><p>profile" targets.  As noted in previous emails, U.S. </p><p>oil companies completely understand the security </p><p>environment in which they operate." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (S/NF) The Mission agrees.  Were we to issue a </p><p>warning about a possible threat to oil installations, </p><p>we would have to provide context, i.e., that the </p><p>information is three years old and of questionable </p><p>reliability.  If we did that, the U.S. oil companies </p><p>would wonder why we bothered.  Being less specific </p><p>(e.g., the original tearline for the referenced TD: </p><p>"As of early May 2003, Al-Qaida may have been </p><p>considering attacks against U.S.-flagged oil tankers </p><p>and U.S. oil companies in Nigeria") risks leading our </p><p>fellow citizens and U.S. oil companies to conclude </p><p>that we have something new or "hot."   Risk-averse </p><p>shipping and insurance companies would also wonder </p><p>what we know.  We could see tankers refuse to call at </p><p>Nigerian ports and/or sharp rises in insurance rates </p><p>for tankers and rigs.  U.S. economic interests and the </p><p>employment prospects of some AmCits in the industry </p><p>could be at risk.  Do we want to run those risks on </p><p>the basis of "outdated and speculative" information? </p><p>We think not. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) In conclusion, the Mission agrees with DS/ITA. </p><p>Unless we have something more than the referenced TD </p><p>and the recent worldwide caution -- something current </p><p>and specific to Nigeria, we believe U.S. oil companies </p><p>in Nigeria are sufficiently concerned about and most </p><p>of their AmCit employees adequately aware of the </p><p>global terrorist threat to U.S. oil interests. </p><p>Because their security-consciousness is so high, any </p><p>warning other than one that makes clear how dated and </p><p>speculative the information is risks being confusing </p><p>and misleading rather than enlightening.  If the </p><p>Department has information that would tend to confirm </p><p>the referenced TD, the Mission would like to receive </p><p>it, so that the EACs might consider it. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU) The Mission is in the process of updating </p><p>the Travel Warning for Nigeria.  We would like to </p><p>defer submission of a new text until after June 4.  By </p><p>then a week will have elapsed since the Presidential </p><p>inauguration, and we will have a better idea of the </p><p>overall security climate. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
