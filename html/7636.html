<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 000739 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF/W AND AF/EPS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECIN, PHUM, EAID, PREL, PGOV, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: GON SAYS NEPAD PEER REVIEW MECHANISM ON </p><p>THE WAY </p><p> </p><p>REF: 02 ABUJA 1027 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary. A GON official says Heads of State at a March </p><p>meeting of the New Partnership for Africa\'s Development </p><p>(NEPAD) had concluded negotiations on a Memorandum of </p><p>Understanding of the African Peer Review Mechanism. The </p><p>official said the review would be conducted by independent </p><p>experts and focus on ways to promote economic growth and </p><p>sustainable development. He also expressed concern that </p><p>international donors not require aid recipients to </p><p>participate in the mechanism. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. Ambassador Isaac Aluko-Olukun, a GON official seconded to </p><p>the Secretariat of NEPAD, told G-8 diplomats in a March 13 </p><p>briefing that NEPAD Heads of State had concluded negotiations </p><p>on a Memorandum of Understanding of the African Peer Review </p><p>Mechanism. He said ten countries had signed on: Algeria, </p><p>Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Mozambique, </p><p>Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, and Uganda. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. At the briefing, Aluko-Olukun clarified that NEPAD, and </p><p>therefore the peer review mechanism, fell under the African </p><p>Union umbrella. A draft Memorandum of Understanding </p><p>distributed at the briefing said the peer review mechanism\'s </p><p>primary purpose was to ". . . foster the adoption of </p><p>policies, standards and practices that lead to political </p><p>stability, high economic growth, sustainable development and </p><p>accelerated sub-regional and continental economic integration </p><p>. . ." The draft memorandum would go into effect when five </p><p>African Union member-states have assented. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. Aluko-Olukun said a special secretariat would be </p><p>established to conduct actual peer reviews. The secretariat </p><p>would include "expatriate professionals" and other technical </p><p>experts. Three reviews would be conducted yearly, meaning </p><p>that some countries would not be reviewed for many years. He </p><p>said that Nigeria may be one of the first countries reviewed, </p><p>but not until after elections. One remaining task, he noted, </p><p>was to find a leader for the secretariat who would inspire </p><p>confidence in the process and lend it credibility. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. Aluko-Olukun said there was some opposition to the </p><p>original draft memorandum because, which some leaders saw as </p><p>"too binding." He said some members were concerned the </p><p>memorandum was a legally binding treaty and, as such, would </p><p>require legislative or other approval. He said the final </p><p>version, which he promised to make available, had met the </p><p>concerns of those members who "didn\'t want to give up </p><p>sovereignty." He added that resolution of the concerns </p><p>regarding sovereignty would not weaken the review mechanism </p><p>because the entire process was voluntary anyway. Aluko-Olukun </p><p>continued that the leaders worried that joining the peer </p><p>review mechanism would become a condition for future </p><p>international development assistance. He said there was </p><p>consensus that the mechanism was an African initiative and </p><p>should remain independent of international donor funding </p><p>decisions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. Aluko-Olukun spoke about cooperation between the G-8 and </p><p>NEPAD, noting that initial G-8 support for NEPAD had "set a </p><p>good tone." He said that a joint G-8 and NEPAD action plan </p><p>could strengthen cooperation in promoting economic, social, </p><p>and political reform in Africa. On conflict resolution, he </p><p>claimed NEPAD was looking beyond just cooperation on </p><p>peacekeeping with G-8 nations and was looking for ways to </p><p>prevent conflict in cooperation with G-8 countries. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. Aluko-Olukun also commented on Poverty Reduction Strategy </p><p>Programs (PRSP) being adopted by some African nations. He </p><p>asserted that many African leaders were disappointed because </p><p>they had agreed to such a program but had not seen any </p><p>supportive international development funding as a result. </p><p>Aluko-Olukun said NEPAD leaders were also concerned that </p><p>often PRSPs did not sufficiently emphasize on trade and </p><p>investment policy and that significant G-8 foreign direct </p><p>investment rarely resulted from them. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. On the role of regional sub-groups within NEPAD and the </p><p>African Union, Aluko-Olukun said that there was a need for </p><p>rationalization: he noted that there were now sixteen </p><p>sub-regional organizations, with many countries belonging to </p><p>several. Aluko-Olukun said there was no easy way to get </p><p>there, but suggested that five regional sub-groups made </p><p>sense, to serve as building blocks for the African Union. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. Comment: Agreement on a Memorandum of Understanding of the </p><p>African Peer Review Mechanism is a notable achievement for </p><p>NEPAD, but the true test for the system will come when the </p><p>secretariat is established and the first review is conducted. </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>We think it unlikely that Nigeria will volunteer to go first, </p><p>and will instead seek postponement until well after </p><p>elections, perhaps not until 2005 or later. A more likely </p><p>candidate is Uganda, another co-founder of NEPAD. End Comment. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
