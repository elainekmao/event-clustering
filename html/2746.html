<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 001159 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 1.6X6 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: ELECTIONEERING IN NIGERIA; PERCEPTIONS </p><p>BEGIN TO SOUR </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ABUJA 829 </p><p>     B. ABUJA 979 </p><p>     C. ABUJA 886 </p><p>     D. ABUJA 680 </p><p>     E. ABUJA 1029 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter; Reason 1.6X6. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: The Electoral Law, Electoral Commissioners, </p><p>and funding for the Electoral Commission all have one thing </p><p>in common: The actions taken by the Obasanjo Administration </p><p>on these key electoral issues, however innocent, raise the </p><p>perception of possible early election rigging in Nigeria. END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The election season has already begun in Nigeria. </p><p>Some candidates for the Presidency have already declared, and </p><p>President Obasanjo is expected to announce his plans for 2003 </p><p>soon.  Tensions have started to rise as potential candidates </p><p>and their supporters begin to harshly and vociferously </p><p>criticize the Administration.  History and reality dictate </p><p>that the 2003 elections are likely to include some </p><p>less-than-democratic practices, such as vote-buying (packets </p><p>of rice and 200 Naira notes).  However, we have already begun </p><p>to see some troubling decisions by the Administration that, </p><p>even if made for the most innocent reasons, give rise to the </p><p>perception that the President is stacking the deck. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The paradigm was begun with the controversial </p><p>Electoral Act.  Since the same Act placed local polls after </p><p>state and national polls in 2003, it prohibited new parties </p><p>from participating in state and national elections until </p><p>2007.  Such an action could be defended as limiting the </p><p>elections to a manageable number of parties.  However, the </p><p>Governors reacted strongly and brought a case before the </p><p>Supreme Court, as it is in their interest to pack new Local </p><p>Government Councils with members who can turn the local </p><p>governments into electoral machines that are supportive of </p><p>the Governors.  National Assembly members seeking more </p><p>financially lucrative gubernatorial posts and an </p><p>Administration seeking to replace certain governors to </p><p>improve reelection prospects, of course, sought a different </p><p>outcome.  The Supreme Court ruled on March 28 that the </p><p>timetable in the Electoral Law was unconstitutional (Ref E). </p><p>Thus, the Governors won round one, and the Supreme Court </p><p>affirmed it constitutional role.  (However, it is entirely </p><p>unclear that the Independent National Electoral Commission </p><p>and the state electoral commissions are prepared to carry out </p><p>local government elections as early as May 18.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>====================== </p><p>WELCOME TO THE MACHINE </p><p>====================== </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) President Obasanjo\'s decision to fire 34 Resident </p><p>Electoral Commissioners (RECs) of the INEC was equally </p><p>disturbing for many.  While the President has the legal </p><p>prerogative to change RECs, this action implies a desire to </p><p>exert greater control over state elections (since most of the </p><p>released officers were appointed before his Administration). </p><p>Lame claims from the PDP that there was no ulterior motive to </p><p>this action have not resonated.  Count the APP among those </p><p>who suspect the Obasanjo Administration\'s electoral </p><p>preparations are less than even-handed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) APP National Chairman Yusuf Ali told reporters that </p><p>his party would sue the Federal Government over the hiring of </p><p>34 new Commissioners to replace the 34 Obasanjo fired several </p><p>weeks ago. (Note: Obasanjo fired all but three of 37 INEC </p><p>State Commissioners resident in the 36 States and the Federal </p><p>Capitol Territory.  The Commissioners are the top INEC </p><p>officials in their jurisdiction and are responsible for the </p><p>preparation of the national election in their locales. End </p><p>Note.)  The APP head claimed that the suit was necessary </p><p>because the new Commissioners were PDP partisans who could </p><p>not be trusted to run impartial elections. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Many of the new Commissioners are PDP loyalists and, </p><p>in at least one state, a member of the PDP state executive </p><p>was appointed to fill the INEC post.  But more importantly, </p><p>according to one source, the President has taken steps to </p><p>make sure PDP party officials in the states and at the </p><p>national level are Obasanjo supporters to prevent threats </p><p>from within his own party.   Commenting to PolMilOff, a PDP </p><p>insider who worked on the 1999 Obasanjo campaign said, "We </p><p>may have to pay someone to challenge the President.  Any real </p><p>opponent would consider the chances of winning and decide not </p><p>to run.  After all, it is hard to lose when you control both </p><p>the players and the referees." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>======================= </p><p>INEC: NO MONEY; NO VOTE </p><p>======================= </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) The Administration has yet to release the 8-billion </p><p>Naira (USD 75m) promised by President Obasanjo for INEC to </p><p>begin voter registration and other election preparations. </p><p>(NOTE: NSA Aliyu Mohammed told the Ambassador that the </p><p>Administration is aware of N119 billion that has been </p><p>allocated by the President but is "stuck" in the Central </p><p>Bank, inferring that this was an effort to sabotage the </p><p>Obasanjo Administration.  It is possible that the INEC monies </p><p>are part of these delayed/missing funds.  END NOTE).  INEC </p><p>has blamed the lack of funding for the delays in its work, </p><p>and has begun to solicit funds from donors.  As tight as the </p><p>Nigerian budget is, it is hard to ignore the fact that </p><p>incomplete registration of voters, particularly in the rural </p><p>north, will serve the reelection efforts of the </p><p>Administration.  Unless new rolls are completed, an important </p><p>percentage of the voting population, those who have turned 18 </p><p>since the last elections, will be disenfranchised from the </p><p>polls.  Moreover, the names of those who have died since the </p><p>last registration exercise will be fair game for those who </p><p>might choose to vote more than once. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>======= </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>======= </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) The validity and outcome of an election is often </p><p>decided long before voting day.  The Obasanjo Administration </p><p>is racking up a series of decisions that give rise to the </p><p>perception of possible early rigging.  As sensitive as </p><p>election issues are likely to be, early discussion with the </p><p>GON about the importance of transparent procedures and the </p><p>importance of how GON actions are perceived is critical.  We </p><p>plan to do just that (See septel on the Mission\'s Elections </p><p>Working Group). </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
