<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 003180 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EINV, ECON, PREL, PGOV, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: UPDATES ON ALSCON AND AJAOKUTA </p><p>PRIVATIZATIONS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) Summary.  The Bureau of Public Enterprise (BPE) has </p><p>confirmed that the GON was going forward with the Aluminium </p><p>Smelter Company of Nigeria (ALSCON) and Ajaokuta Steel </p><p>Company Limited (ASCL).  U.S. manufacturer Aluminum Company </p><p>of America (ALCOA) is one of three companies expressing </p><p>interest in the ALSCON purchase (a 51 percent stake).  The </p><p>other companies are Glencore (a Swiss company) and Russian </p><p>Aluminum.  The BPE has scheduled a late-January selection of </p><p>a core investor from the interested bidders.  Only one </p><p>company expressed interest in the purchase of the Ajaokuta </p><p>Steel Company Limited leading to an extension of the deadline </p><p>to November 21.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) ALSCON, a 2.36 billion dollar capital investment, is </p><p>one of the world,s most expensive smelters.  Located at Ikot </p><p>Abasi, Akwa Ibom State, the company occupies roughly 100 </p><p>hectares with direct access to the Imo River. The company was </p><p>incorporated in 1989 but only produced aluminum ingots </p><p>between 1997 and 1999, and never exceeded half of its </p><p>projected 193,000 ton-a-year capacity.  The BPE listed a) </p><p>inadequate working capital; b) the high price of natural gas; </p><p>c) the need to re-dredge the Imo River; d) a hostile local </p><p>community; and e) non-completion of the project as the </p><p>problems which led to the May 1999 closure of the plant. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Reynolds Aluminum initially served as the plant\'s </p><p>technical advisor and held a ten percent equity stake until </p><p>the company was bought out by ALCOA.  (The Government of </p><p>Nigeria retains a 70 percent equity interest in ALSCON and </p><p>the German company Ferrostaal AG, a division of the MAN </p><p>group, holds 20 percent.) After ALCOA\'s initial negotiations </p><p>with the GON proved unsatisfactory, the U.S. company </p><p>announced it would divest itself of its ten percent ownership </p><p>of ALSCON and abandon its role as technical advisor. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Since ALSCON shut down production in 1999, the GON has </p><p>not stopped investing money in the project.  According to </p><p>Abiodun Wright, the BPE official supervising the ALSCON </p><p>privatization, more than half a million dollars a month is </p><p>spent to maintain a skeleton staff of 700 to keep the </p><p>machinery in working order. Ms. Wright called the </p><p>expenditures necessary to keep the facility in a </p><p>"preservation mode", to make it more attractive to potential </p><p>investors and so that the eventual winning bidder can </p><p>commence operations immediately. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (U)  ALCOA now seems poised to re-enter the negotiation </p><p>for ALSCON.  "This Day" newspaper quoted a GON source as </p><p>saying ALCOA had decided not to divest but was looking to </p><p>increase its equity in ALSCON.  Recent news articles suggest </p><p>ALCOA may have the inside track of winning the bid. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>Ajaokuta Steel Company Limited (ASCL) </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) After her update on ALSCON, Wright asked how BPE </p><p>could more effectively advertise to the U.S. to find a core </p><p>investor for the Ajaokuta steel complex.  Earlier in the </p><p>month, the BPE extended the submission date to November 21 </p><p>for those interested in a 51 percent stake in the Ajaokuta </p><p>Steel Company. The uncompleted plant has been regarded </p><p>internationally as the quintessential "white elephant" </p><p>project.  The World Bank reportedly advised the GON to </p><p>abandon the dream of producing steel and consider converting </p><p>the complex into an industrial estate or power plant. </p><p>(Comment: Ajaokuta,s technology is several generations </p><p>behind. It is difficult to envision a scenario where the </p><p>plant could be more profitable.  Perhaps because of this, </p><p>only one company has expressed interest in becoming the core </p><p>investor.  End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) When asked why the GON continued committing funds </p><p>into the Ajaokuta although it was going to be privatized, </p><p>Wright confided that the Ministry of Power and Steel had </p><p>until very recently maintained the hope of running Ajaokuta </p><p>as a State-owned enterprise. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.    (SBU) Perhaps the general lack of budget resources -- </p><p>as much as BPE\'s Privatization Act -- led to the Power and </p><p>Steel Ministry\'s losing its battle to build and run this </p><p>steel city that stretches for miles, costs billions of </p><p>dollars, and never produced a single bar of steel.  Agagu has </p><p>reportedly just resigned as Minister of Power and Steel to </p><p>run for Governor of Ondo State in the Southwest. Before </p><p>leaving, he made a public statement predicting the steel </p><p>plant would be completed soon and that Nigeria would realize </p><p>its goal of becoming a steel-producing industrial nation. </p><p>This appears to be an exaggeration of Ajaokutan dimensions. </p><p>Meanwhile, the Guardian newspaper (Lagos-based) of November </p><p>21 reports that Siemens Limited won a contract worth $390 </p><p>million Euros to build a power generating and transmission </p><p>facility at Ajaokuta, as recommended by the World Bank. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
