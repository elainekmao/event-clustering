<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L BAGHDAD 03856 </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR ROSENBLATT </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS: PREL, US, IZ </p><p>SUBJ:  SADDAM AND THE WESTERN MEDIA--CONTINUED </p><p> </p><p>REFS:  (A)  BAGHDAD 3788, (B) BAGHDAD 3783 </p><p> </p><p>1. (C-ENTIRE TEXT) </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY  THE GOI HAS PUBLICLY AND PRIVATELY </p><p>COMPLAINED ABOUT "DISTORTION" IN THE ABC VERSION </p><p>OF PRESIDENT SADDAM HUSAYN\'S INTERVIEW WITH </p><p>DIANE SAWYER.  IT HAS PUBLISHED BOTH THE THREE- </p><p>HOUR "UNCUT" VERSION AND WHAT IT CLAIMS IS THE </p><p>TEXT OF THE 20-MINUTE ABC PROGRAM. </p><p>ONCE AGAIN, SADDAM HAS FOUND "EVIDENCE" OF A U.S. </p><p>CAMPAIGN AGAINST HIM, YET HE IS SOLDIERING ON IN </p><p>HIS NEW POLICY OF AVAILABILITY TO THE WESTERN </p><p>PRESS (LE  FIGARO IS NEXT) AND IN HIS WILLING- </p><p>NESS TO LET THE IRAQI PUBLIC SEE AND HEAR HIM </p><p>UNCUT,WARTS AND ALL.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  FOLLOWING THE MEDIA HEADLINES GIVEN TO </p><p>PRESIDENT BUSH\'S \'ID AL-ADHA MESSAGE TO IRAQI </p><p>PRESIDENT SADDAM HUSAYN (REF A) AND SADDAM\'S </p><p>CORDIAL REPLY (HIGHLIGHTED IN JULY 6 NEWSPAPERS), </p><p>IRAQ\'S GOVERNMENT-DIRECTED ARABIC PRESS LET OUT </p><p>A HOWL OF FRUSTRATION JULY 7 AT ABC AND DIANE </p><p>SAWYER FOR AIRING ONLY A SMALL "DISTORTED" </p><p>PORTION OF SADDAM\'S JUNE 24 THREE-HOUR PLUS </p><p>INTERVIEW WITH SAWYER.  "DELIBERATE DISTORTION </p><p>IN CONVERSATION OF THE LEADER WITH AMERICAN TV </p><p>NETWORK:  THIS IS THE SPURIOUS DEMOCRACY OF THE </p><p>AMERICANS."  THE ARTICLE ACCOMPANYING THE HEAD- </p><p>LINES DEVELOPS THESE THEMES AND INVITES READERS </p><p>TO COMPARE WHAT ABC AIRED (TEXT PRINTED JULY 7) </p><p>WITH TEXT OF THE FULL INTERVIEW  (PUBLISHED </p><p>JUNE 30), TO SEE JUST HOW DISTORTED U.S. REPORT- </p><p>ING ON IRAQ IS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  U/S HAMDUN MADE THE SAME COMPLAINT ABOUT </p><p>"DISTORTION" TO US PRIVATELY, THOUGH IN MORE </p><p>TEMPERATE TERMS, ON JUNE 30.  WHEN WE POINTED </p><p>OUT THAT COMPRESSING 3 HOURS INTO 20 MINUTES </p><p>WOULD UNAVOIDABLY REMOVE SOME OF THE CONTEXT </p><p>OF SPECIFIC REMARKS, HAMDUN SAID HE MEANT THERE </p><p>WAS DELIBERATE AND NEGATIVE DISTORTION (HE HAD </p><p>SEEN THE ABC VERSION). </p><p> </p><p>5.  COMMENT:  CLEARLY, THE ABC INCIDENT HAS </p><p>FUELLED SADDAM\'S BELIEF THAT THE WESTERN MEDIA </p><p>ARE ENGAGED IN AN ANTI-IRAQ CAMPAIGN--EDITORIALS </p><p>ARE ALREADY MAKING THAT POINT--AND ADD TO THE </p><p>SENSE THAT IRAQ WILL NOT GET A "FAIR" HEARING </p><p>IN THE WEST.  NEVERTHELESS, SADDAM IS NOT THROWING </p><p>IN THE TOWEL; HE IS EXPECTED TO GRANT AN </p><p>INTERVIEW TO  LE FIGARO THIS WEEK, AND 40 MORE </p><p>EUROPEAN (AND ONE JAPANESE) JOURNALISTS HAVE </p><p>SENT IN THEIR REQUESTS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  IT IS INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT NOT ONLY HAVE </p><p>THE IRAQIS REACTED TO THE "DISTORTION" BY </p><p>RUNNING SIX HOURS OF SADDAM\'S INTERVIEWS BUT HAVE </p><p>PRINTED WHAT WAS AIRED BY ABC, INCLUDING MATERIAL </p><p>THAT WAS EXCISED FROM THE VERSION OF THE INTER- </p><p>VIEW AS BROADCAST HERE.  THE JULY 7 ARABIC </p><p>PRESS TRANSCRIPTS OF THAT INTERVIEW CONTAIN, FOR </p><p>EXAMPLE, SADDAM\'S DENIAL THAT HE EVER KILLED </p><p>ANYONE AND HIS EXCHANGE WITH SAWYER ABOUT PUNISH- </p><p>MENT FOR THOSE WHO INSULT THE PRESIDENT.  BUT, </p><p>AS WE HAVE SAID BEFORE, IT SHOULD BE CLEAR TO </p><p>EVERYONE THAT SADDAM HUSAYN IS FEELING COMFORT- </p><p>ABLE AND CONFIDENT:  HE PERMITTED ALL IRAQIS </p><p>TO READ AND SEE HIS INTERVIEWS, DEMONSTRATING </p><p>THAT HE DOES NOT MIND APPEARING BEFORE THEM AS </p><p>LESS THAN IMPECCABLE. </p><p> </p><p>7.  ACTION REQUESTED.  WE ARE MOST KEEN TO SEE </p><p>A VIDEO OF SAWYER\'S INTERVIEW WITH SADDAM, IN </p><p>ORDER TO COMPARE IT WITH THE TWO VERSIONS </p><p>PUBLISHED HERE. </p><p> </p><p>GLASPIE </p><p></p></div>
