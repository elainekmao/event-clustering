<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L VATICAN 003503 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EUR/WE (MENNUTI) </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/15/2012 </p><p>TAGS: IS, PGOV, PHUM, PREL, VT </p><p>SUBJECT: (C) VATICAN SEES ARAFAT\'S MARGINALIZATION AS ROAD </p><p>TO RADICALIZATION AND MILITARY SOLUTION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: CLASSIFIED BY D. BRENT HARDT, CDA, REASON E.O. 12958 1.5 </p><p> (B,D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C)  SUMMARY:  VATICAN DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER MIGLIORE </p><p>TOLD DCM JULY 12 THAT USG MARGINALIZATION OF ARAFAT WILL </p><p>LIKELY EMPOWER HAMAS AND THEREBY JUSTIFY ISRAEL PM SHARON\'S </p><p>PLAN TO SEEK A MILITARY SOLUTION.  THE VATICAN BELIEVES </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  03503  151458Z </p><p>ARAFAT\'S PRESENCE CAN STILL LIMIT HAMAS\' APPEAL. ACCORDING TO </p><p>MIGLIORE, THE VATICAN SUPPORTS AN INTERNATIONAL PEACEKEEPING </p><p>FORCE FOR THE PALESTINIAN TERRITORIES, AND WOULD SEEK A SEAT </p><p>AT ANY INTERNATIONAL PEACE CONFERENCE FOR THE MIDDLE EAST. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  DURING INCOMING DCM\'S JULY 12 COURTESY CALL ON </p><p>VATICAN DFM CELESTINO MIGLIORE, MIGLIORE RAISED HIS CONCERN </p><p>AT USG POLICY CALLING FOR NEW LEADERSHIP OF THE PALESTINIAN </p><p>AUTHORITY.  MIGLIORE SAID THE ISRAEL/PALESTINIAN CONFLICT </p><p>REMAINS OF GREAT CONCERN TO THE HOLY SEE, WHICH WISHES TO SEE </p><p>AN INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE CONVENED AS SOON AS PRACTICABLE. </p><p>WHILE ACKNOWLEDGING ARAFAT\'S SHORTCOMINGS. HE AVERRED THAT </p><p>ARAFAT REMAINS A USEFUL RALLYING SYMBOL FOR PALESTINIANS.  TO </p><p>MOVE HIM OUT NOW WOULD ONLY PAVE THE WAY FOR MORE RADICAL </p><p>ELEMENTS SUCH AS HAMAS, HE PREDICTED.  DRAWING THE THREAD OUT </p><p>FURTHER, MIGLIORE SAID MARGINALIZING ARAFAT WOULD BE A "GIFT </p><p>TO SHARON," WHO WOULD THEN BE FREE TO PURSUE THE MILITARY </p><p>CAMPAIGN THAT THE HOLY SEE BELIEVES HE HAS WANTED ALL ALONG </p><p>-- AND SOMETHING THE HOLY SEE CATEGORICALLY REJECTS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  MIGLIORE RECALLED THAT SECRETARY POWELL TOLD VATICAN </p><p>PM EQUIVALENT CARDINAL SODANO DURING THE PRESIDENT\'S JUNE </p><p>VATICAN VISIT THAT THERE WAS NO CURRENT PLANNING FOR A </p><p>CONFERENCE TO EXPLORE WAYS TO MOVE THE PEACE PROCESS FORWARD. </p><p> MIGLIORE UNDERSCORED THE IMPORTANCE OF DEVELOPING IDEAS FOR </p><p>MOVING THE PROCESS FORWARD.  HE SAID THE HOLY SEE HAS ITS OWN </p><p>IDEAS, BUT NO PLAN AS SUCH, OTHER THAN ITS "CLEAR AND </p><p>SPECIFIC POLICY OF SUPPORT FOR INTERNATIONAL PROTECTION FOR </p><p>THE HOLY PLACES IN JERUSALEM."  HE DID REMIND US OF THE HOLY </p><p>SEE\'S STANDING SUPPORT FOR AN INTERNATIONAL INTER-POSITIONAL </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  03503  151458Z </p><p>FORCE TO STOP THE VIOLENCE, AND NOW ITS STRONG INTEREST IN AN </p><p>OBSERVER ROLE IN ANY INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON THE MEPP. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  COMMENT:  THE LEITMOTIF OF HOLY SEE FOREIGN POLICY </p><p>IS DEFENSE OF THE HUMAN PERSON THROUGH PEACE, DIALOGUE, AND </p><p>SOLIDARITY.  THE VATICAN IS FEARFUL THAT THE PACE AND LEVEL </p><p>OF VIOLENCE IN ISRAEL AND THE PALESTINIAN TERRITORIES HAS </p><p>DULLED PEOPLES\' SENSES, AND THAT VIOLENCE WILL TURN WORSE </p><p>BEFORE IT EASES (IN FACT, FM TAURAN EXPRESSED THESE FEARS TO </p><p>US WHEN THE CURRENT INTIFADA BEGAN IN LATE 2000).  ARAFAT, AS </p><p>DIFFICULT AS HE IS, HAS BEEN A REGULAR VISITOR AT THE HOLY </p><p>SEE AND IS SOMEONE THE VATICAN FEELS IT CAN WORK WITH TO </p><p>PROTECT THE CHRISTIAN HOLY SITES.  THE VATICAN NOW SEES ITS </p><p>INTERESTS THREATENED EVER MORE BY A POSSIBLE TURN AMONG </p><p>PALESTINIANS TO ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALIST LEADERSHIP IF ARAFAT </p><p>GOES. </p><p>HARDT </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> </p><p></p><p> 2002VATICA03503 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
