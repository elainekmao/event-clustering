<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ASHGABAT 001049 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/07/11 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, TX </p><p>SUBJECT: BERDIEV SACKED; MEREDOV NEW FOREIGN MINISTER </p><p> </p><p>(U) CLASSIFIED BY CDA ERIC T. SCHULTZ, REASONS 1.5 (B) </p><p>AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) PRESIDENT NIYAZOV OPENED THE SEVENTH SESSION OF </p><p>THE MEJLIS (PARLIAMENT) JULY 7 WITH A SPEECH IN WHICH HE </p><p>HARSHLY CRITICIZED AND THEN DISMISSED FOREIGN MINISTER </p><p>BATYR BERDIEV.  NIYAZOV ACCUSED BERDIEV OF EXCESSIVE </p><p>DRINKING, AND SAID THAT AS A RESULT OF BERDIEV\'S PERSONAL </p><p>FAILINGS HE HAD BEEN INEFFECTIVE IN MANAGING EITHER THE </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTRY OR THE COUNTRY\'S EXTERNAL RELATIONS.  IN </p><p>PARTICULAR HE CITED CORRUPTION IN THE MINISTRY\'S CONSULAR </p><p>SECTION\'S VISA ISSUANCE AND THE MINISTRY\'S FAILURE TO </p><p>MAKE PROGRESS ON RESOLVING THE DISPUTE WITH AZERBAIJAN </p><p>OVER CASPIAN DEMARCATION.  HE ALSO CRITICIZED BERDIEV FOR </p><p>PROMOTING PEOPLE FROM HIS OWN REGION AND FAILING TO </p><p>IDENTIFY AND PROMOTE A GOOD FIRST DEPUTY MINISTER. </p><p>NIYAZOV PROMISED BERDIEV AN ONWARD ASSIGNMENT BUT GAVE NO </p><p>INDICATION WHAT IT WOULD BE. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) NIYAZOV APPOINTED THE CHAIRMAN OF THE MEJLIS, </p><p>RASHID MEREDOV TO BE THE NEW FOREIGN MINSTER AND NAMED </p><p>THE GOVERNOR OF BALKANABAT PROVINCE (TURKMENBASHI) </p><p>REJEPBAY ARAZOV AS MEREDOV\'S REPLACEMENT.  MEREDOV HAD </p><p>ONLY BEEN SPEAKER, NOMINALLY THE NUMBER TWO POSITION IN </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT, SINCE APRIL.  ARAZOV HAD BEEN GOVERNOR OF </p><p>BALKANABAT SINCE LAST JANUARY, WHEN HE WAS TRANSFERRED </p><p>FROM OIL AND GAS MINISTER.  IN THE NEUTRAL TURKMENISTAN </p><p>REPORT OF THE SPEECH, NIYAZOV IS QUOTED AS TELLING </p><p>MEREDOV THAT KNB CHAIRMAN MUHAMMET NAZAROV WILL OVERSEE </p><p>HIS WORK.  NAZAROV THUS (OFFICIALLY) ADDS FOREIGN AFFAIRS </p><p>TO HIS EVER-GROWING LIST OF RESPONSIBILITIES. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) CHARGE SPOKE AT LENGTH JULY 5 WITH TWO FORMER </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTRY OFFICIALS WHO ARE HEADED TO THE U.S. ON </p><p>MUSKIE FELLOWSHIPS, NIKOLAI NAZAROV AND AZAT ATANJANOV. </p><p>THEY FORESHADOWED BERDIEV\'S DEPARTURE, NOTING THAT WHILE </p><p>HE HAD BEEN A VERY GOOD AMBASSADOR IN VIENNA AT THE OSCE, </p><p>HE HAD PROVEN A POOR MANAGER AND HAD BEEN UNABLE TO </p><p>ESTABLISH HIS AUTHORITY OVER THE MINISTRY.  HE HAD BEEN </p><p>UNABLE TO ACQUIRE EITHER THE RESOURCES OR THE ACCESS TO </p><p>THE PRESIDENT THAT WOULD HAVE BUTTRESSED HIS AUTHORITY. </p><p>THEY BOTH ALSO FORESHADOWED NAZAROV\'S NEW ROLE, NOTING </p><p>NIYAZOV\'S PATTERN OF LOADING DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES </p><p>ON A TRUSTED DEPUTY.  SHIKHMURADOV HAD FILLED THAT ROLE </p><p>THROUGHOUT MUCH OF THE DECADE.  WITH HIS FALL FROM POWER, </p><p>THE FOREIGN MINISTRY HAD ALSO LOST INFLUENCE. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) COMMENT: BERDIEV WAS PRESENT ALONG WITH NAZAROV </p><p>AND MEREDOV AT THE EMBASSY\'S JULY 4 RECEPTION.  HE GAVE </p><p>US NO INDICATION THAT HIS DISMISSAL WAS IMMINENT. </p><p>HOWEVER, MOST OF THE DIPLOMATIC CORPS HAS FELT FOR SOME </p><p>TIME THAT HE WAS ON THIN ICE.  IN PART, THIS WAS BECAUSE </p><p>BERDIEV WAS SEEN AS FORMER FOREIGN MINISTER </p><p>SHIKHMURADOV\'S MAN.  IN PART, IT WAS BECAUSE BERDIEV WAS </p><p>TOO YOUNG, TOO INEXPERIENCED, AND TOO WEAK TO SURVIVE IN </p><p>TURKMEN POLITICS.  NONETHELESS, THE PREVAILING SENTIMENT </p><p>IS THAT BERDIEV\'S DISMISSAL, AND ESPECIALLY THE PERSONAL </p><p>ATTACK ON HIS CHARACTER, WAS UNJUST. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) COMMENT CONTINUED: THE CHOICE OF MEREDOV IS A </p><p>SURPRISE, BUT NOT NECESSARILY AN UNPLEASANT ONE FOR US. </p><p>HE IS A 41-YEAR-OLD LAWYER WITH SOME ENGLISH, WHO SEEMS </p><p>WESTERN-ORIENTED.  HOWEVER THE MOST INTERESTING </p><p>BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE IS THAT HIS FATHER, OVEZGELDIY, IS ONE </p><p>OF THE EMBASSY\'S LANGUAGE INSTRUCTORS, A FACT WHICH </p><p>CANNOT HAVE BEEN UNKNOWN TO NIYAZOV.  MEREDOV\'S </p><p>APPOINTMENT, TAKEN TOGETHER WITH NAZAROV\'S RARE PRESENCE </p><p>AT THE JULY 4 RECEPTION (HE ALMOST NEVER ATTENDS NATIONAL </p><p>DAYS AND DID NOT ATTEND EITHER THE RUSSIAN SOVEREIGNTY </p><p>DAY JUNE 12, OR THE QUEEN\'S BIRTHDAY JUNE 16), AND THE </p><p>RECENT EXIM PAYMENT OF USD 50 MILLION, COULD BE SEEN AS </p><p>THE BEGINNING OF A TURKMEN EFFORT TO REENGAGE WITH THE </p><p>U.S., AS AMBASSADOR MANN URGED THE GOTX TO DO IN HIS </p><p>FAREWELL CALLS. </p><p> </p><p>SCHULTZ </p><p></p></div>
