JAMES NICHOLSON FOR REASONS </p><p>1.5 (A) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.(U) SENATOR, I WOULD LIKE TO CONGRATULATE YOU ON YOUR </p><p>APPOINTMENT  AS THE PRESIDENT\'S SPECIAL ENVOY FOR PEACE IN </p><p>SUDAN.  THE DIFFICULT SITUATION IN THAT COUNTRY IS ONE OF </p><p>THE MOST PRESSING ISSUES FOR THE VATICAN ON THE AFRICAN </p><p>CONTINENT. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  05577  262037Z </p><p> </p><p>2.(SBU) BECAUSE OF THE VATICAN\'S DEEP INTEREST IN THE </p><p>CONFLICT IN SUDAN, I WOULD LIKE TO INVITE YOU TO PAY A </p><p>VISIT DURING YOUR UPCOMING TRAVEL TO DISCUSS THE </p><p>SITUATION WITH THE VATICAN\'S FOREIGN MINISTER ARCHBISHOP </p><p>TAURAN.  THE SUDAN IS AN AREA IN WHICH THE UNITED STATES </p><p>AND THE VATICAN SHARE MUTUAL CONCERNS AND OBJECTIVESNLS. </p><p> </p><p>3.(C) MY EMBASSY HAS ENGAGED THE VATICAN ON THE SUDAN </p><p>ISSUE OVER THE LAST YEAR.  IN 2000, FOR INSTANCE, WHEN </p><p>SUDAN WAS A CANDIDATE FOR A UN SECURITY COUNCIL SEAT, </p><p>EMBASSY VATICAN APPROACHED THE VATICAN FOREIGN MINISTER </p><p>AND ASKED HIM TO USE THE VATICAN\'S INFLUENCE IN CERTAIN </p><p>COUNTRIES TO DEFEAT THE SUDANESE CANDIDACIES.  VATICAN </p><p>NUNCIOS (AMBASSADORS) IN SEVERAL KEY COUNTRIES MET WITH </p><p>THEIR HOST COUNTRY FOREIGN MINISTERS AND PRESENTED THE </p><p>CASE.  THE SUDANESE CANDIDACY WAS DEFEATED, AND THE </p><p>VATICAN PLAYED AN IMPORTANT ROLE. </p><p>4.(C) EMBASSY VATICAN HAS ALSO BEEN INVOLVED IN </p><p>DEVELOPING CONTACTS AND SOURCES THAT CAN BE USEFUL TO </p><p>YOUR MISSION.  ARCHBISHOP FITZGERALD, THE DIRECTOR OF THE </p><p>PONTIFICAL COUNCIL FOR INTERELIGIOUS DIALOG AND AN EXPERT </p><p>ON ISLAM, HAS MAINTAINED CONTACTS WITH ISLAMIC LEADERS IN </p><p>SUDAN AND IS AN EXPERT ON THE SITUATION.  FABRIZIO </p><p>RICARDI, A LEADER OF THE SANT\'EGIDIO COMMUNITY (THE </p><p>VATICAN NGO WHICH NEGOTIATED THE MOZAMBIQUE PEACE TREATY) </p><p>HAS BEEN TRAVELLING TO THE SUDAN ON A REGULAR BASIS. THE </p><p>COMBONI FATHERS, A MAJOR CATHOLIC MISSIONARY ORDER WHICH </p><p>IS BASED IN ROME AND THE ITALIAN CITY OF PESARO, HAS A </p><p>LARGE PRESENCE IN SOUTHERN SUDAN. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  05577  262037Z </p><p>5.(SBU) IF YOUR SCHEDULE PERMITS, I WOULD RECOMMEND A </p><p>DISCUSSION WITH THE VATICAN FOREIGN MINISTER ON NEXT </p><p>STEPS IN THE SUDAN.  I WOULD ALSO USE THE OPPORTUNITY OF </p><p>YOUR VISIT TO INTRODUCE YOU AND YOUR STAFF TO VATICAN AND </p><p>OTHER OFFICIALS WHO MIGHT BE ABLE TO ASSIST YOU IN YOUR </p><p>MISSION. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) I HOPE YOU WILL BE ABLE TO STOP IN VATICAN CITY, </p><p>I WOULD GREATLY APPRECIATE HEARING DIRECTLY FROM YOU ON </p><p>WAYS I CAN BETTER ENGAGE THE VATICAN IN PURSUIT OF YOUR </p><p>OBJECTIVES.  NICHOLSON </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> </p><p></p><p> 2001VATICA05577 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
