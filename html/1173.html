SUMMARY AND ACTION REQUEST:  This is an action request; </p><p>see paragraph five below.  The Finance Section of the </p><p>International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia </p><p>(ICTY) has recently renewed its 1998 request for advice as to </p><p>the proper disposition to be made of a refund (in the amount </p><p>of NLG 190,165) from the Dutch tax authorities of value-added </p><p>tax (VAT) paid on goods and services purchased with USG funds </p><p>and donated to the ICTY.  Embassy requests guidance.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  In 1994, the USG proposed a donation in kind of a </p><p>computer system -- computer hardware and software and all </p><p>necessary support, including installation, maintenance, and </p><p>training -- for the Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) of the </p><p>ICTY.  In 1995, the USG DOJ used a contract with CACI </p><p>International Inc., a U.S. corporation, to purchase computer </p><p>goods and services.  CACI, in turn, subcontracted with Borsu </p><p>Systema, a Dutch corporation, to provide some of those goods </p><p>and services in The Netherlands.  The goods and services were </p><p>then contributed by the USG to the ICTY pursuant to the 1994 </p><p>proposal of an in-kind donation of a computer system. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  Borsu Systema, the aforementioned Dutch subcontractor, </p><p>charged VAT for the goods and services it provided.  As a </p><p>consequence, since 1996, the Embassy has been engaged in </p><p>efforts to recover the VAT paid on those goods and services. </p><p>In 1998, the Finance Section of the ICTY notified the Embassy </p><p>that the Dutch Government had deposited into the ICTY\'s bank </p><p>account a VAT refund (in the amount of NLG 190,165) for VAT </p><p>that had been paid on goods and services purchased with USG </p><p>funds and donated to the ICTY.  The ICTY asked whether the </p><p>USG agreed to the money being deposited in the ICTY\'s </p><p>account.  Per reftel, Embassy sought guidance as to whether </p><p>the refunded VAT could be retained by the ICTY.  Embassy also </p><p>requested guidance as to whether there were any legal or </p><p>other constraints that would restrict the purposes for which </p><p>the funds could be used. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  On 18 May 2000, Embassy received a letter from the </p><p>Finance Section of the ICTY, renewing its request for advice </p><p>as to whether the Tribunal could keep the refunded VAT in the </p><p>amount of NLG 190,165, or whether it must pay it back to the </p><p>USG. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. ACTION REQUEST:  Embassy seeks guidance as to whether the </p><p>refunded VAT may be retained by the ICTY.  If the ICTY may </p><p>retain the funds, please advise whether there are any legal </p><p>or other constraints that would restrict the purposes for </p><p>which the funds could be used.  Finally, if ICTY may not </p><p>retain the funds, please provide instructions for the ICTY to </p><p>transfer the funds back to the USG. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  A copy of the ICTY letter to the Embassy has been faxed </p><p>to the Department (S/WCI - Warrick). </p><p>SCHNEIDER </p><p></p></div>
