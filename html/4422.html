<p>UNCLAS TEGUCIGALPA 003170 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR PD/WHA (MBUCKLEY) </p><p>INFO IIP </p><p>EMBASSIES FOR PAOS, APAOS, Ios, </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: OIIP, KPAO, HO, PA </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION:"GREEN LIGHT" </p><p> </p><p>Editorial in Tegucigalpa-based daily "La Tribuna"(liberal </p><p>party periodical) (11/16),"Green Light": The victory of the </p><p>Republicans in the recent elections has given Bush a </p><p>majority in both the Senate and the House, which has not </p><p>occurred since President Eisenhower. </p><p> </p><p>"The vast majority of the voters relegated to second </p><p>priority their normal concerns with the economy and their </p><p>personal well-being." </p><p> </p><p>"The Democrats underestimated Bush\'s popularity. In all the </p><p>elections, Bush made the difference.  His campaign expert </p><p>Karl Rove did not allow the voters to forget the terrorist </p><p>attacks. And coincidentally, during the two weeks preceding </p><p>the election, a sniper was terrorizing Washington, D.C.-- </p><p>individual security, collective security, the security of </p><p>the nation were the only real themes of this election". </p><p> </p><p>"The final triumph of Bush is the victory he obtained in the </p><p>Security Council of the UN. Any negative reaction by Sadam </p><p>would now give Bush the green light he needs to invade Iraq </p><p>with the consent of the entire international community. </p><p>Bush does not want to disarm Iraq -- he wants to eliminate </p><p>Hussein. It has been a long time since a U.S. President has </p><p>had such support for his initiatives. This victory presages </p><p>a much greater role for the imperial power in world </p><p>politics." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
