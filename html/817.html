<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 RIYADH 000763 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FOR INR/B </p><p> </p><p>E.O.12958: DECL:  2/27/2011 </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, PINR, SA </p><p>SUBJECT:  SAUDI ARABIA: CROWN PRINCE\'S FAMILY ALLIES </p><p> </p><p>REF: 95 RIYADH 5297 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  CLASSIFIED BY DCM THEODORE KATTOUF: 1.5 B. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  SPECULATION THAT THE CROWN PRINCE ANGRILY </p><p>DEPARTED FOR HAFR AL-BATIN FOLLOWING KING FAHD\'S </p><p>RESUMPTION OF FULL GOVERNING POWERS ON FEBRUARY 21 IS </p><p>DISMISSED BY SOURCES WITHIN THE SAUDI ARABIA NATIONAL </p><p>GUARD AND AMONG ABDULLAH\'S ADVISERS.  NONETHELESS, THE </p><p>NUMBER OF SENIOR PRINCES WHO ACCOMPANIED THE CROWN </p><p>PRINCE ON HIS FAMILY CAMPING TRIP ILLUSTRATES THE </p><p>POLITICAL ALLIANCES WHICH ABDULLAH HAS CULTIVATED TO </p><p>OFFSET THE DOMINATION OF THE NUMEROUS AND POWERFULLY </p><p>POSITIONED SUDAYRI BROTHERS.  THE FAMILY ENCLAVE </p><p>DEMONSTRATES PUBLICLY ABDULLAH\'S STRONG BASE AMONG THE </p><p>SURVIVING SONS OF KING ABD AL-AZIZ.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>ABDULLAH PITCHES TENT IN HAFR AL-BATIN </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  ON FEBRUARY 22, THE DAY AFTER FAHD UNEXPECTEDLY </p><p>RESUMED FULL GOVERNING POWERS WHICH ENDED THE CROWN </p><p>PRINCE\'S TWO MONTH REGENCY, ABDULLAH DEPARTED RIYADH FOR </p><p>AN OPULENT FAMILY CAMPING TRIP IN THE NORTH-EASTERN </p><p>CORNER OF THE KINGDOM, AT HAFR AL-BATIN.  SOURCES WITHIN </p><p>THE SAUDI ARABIA NATIONAL GUARD DISMISS RUMORS THAT </p><p>ABDULLAH LEFT IN A HUFF, NOTING THAT SUCH A DESERT </p><p>OUTING IS NORMAL FOR THE CROWN PRINCE, BUT HAD BEEN </p><p>DELAYED WHILE HE FILLED IN FOR FAHD.  ACCORDING TO ONE </p><p>OF THE CROWN PRINCE\'S ADVISERS, ABDULLAH DEPARTED </p><p>QUICKLY FOR HAFR AL-BATIN SINCE HIS PRESENCE IN THE </p><p>CAPITAL IS REQUIRED PRIOR TO THE START OF THE ANNUAL </p><p>SANG-SPONSORED CULTURAL FESTIVAL, JANADRIYYAH, SLATED TO </p><p>BEGIN MARCH 7. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  SOME ROYAL OBSERVERS ARGUE THAT ABDULLAH\'S </p><p>RETREAT TO HAFR IS A REFLECTION OF THE KING\'S </p><p>SATISFACTION WITH THE CP\'S GOVERNING PERFORMANCE SINCE </p><p>THE ROYAL CAMP SITE IS TRADITIONALLY THE PRESERVE OF </p><p>FAHD AND HIS INTIMATES.  ONLY TRUSTED AIDES, CLOSE </p><p>ADVISERS, AND IMMEDIATE FAMILY MEMBERS ACCOMPANY THE </p><p>KING ON HIS TRIPS TO HAFR, A SITE WHICH HAS BEEN USED TO </p><p>FETE BOTH PRESIDENT CLINTON AND FORMER SECSTATE SHULTZ. </p><p>LENDING WEIGHT TO THIS INTERPRETATION IS THE FACT THAT </p><p>WHEN THE CROWN PRINCE HAS SOUGHT TO COMMUNICATE HIS </p><p>DISPLEASURE WITH ROYAL DECISIONS IN THE PAST, HE HAS </p><p>FLOWN OFF TO MOROCCO, NOT TO THE KINGDOM\'S BEDOUIN </p><p>INTERIOR. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>AND TAKES ALONG HIS COTERIE OF ROYAL SUPPORTERS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  THE FAMILY CONSTELLATION WHICH ACCOMPANIED </p><p>ABDULLAH ON HIS POST-REGENCY RETREAT REPRESENTS AN </p><p>INTRIGUING SNAP-SHOT OF WHOM, AMONG THE MORE SENIOR </p><p>ROYAL FAMILY MEMBERS, SHARES A PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP </p><p>WITH THE CROWN PRINCE.  THE CAMPERS INCLUDED: </p><p> </p><p>O    HALF-BROTHERS: </p><p> </p><p>THE STANDARD COTERIE OF NON-SUDAYRI HALF-BROTHERS IS </p><p>PRESENT IN HAFR, INCLUDING: DEPUTY SANG COMMANDER, BADR </p><p>BIN ABD AL-AZIZ; HAIL GOVERNOR MUQRIN BIN ABD AL-AZIZ; </p><p>MEDINA GOVERNOR ABD AL-MAJID BIN ABD AL-AZIZ; FORMER </p><p>QASIM GOVERNOR, ABD AL-ILAH BIN ABD AL-AZIZ; FORMER </p><p>MECCA GOVERNOR, FAWWAZ BIN ABD AL-AZIZ; AND NAWWAF BIN </p><p>ABD AL-AZIZ.  (COMMENT:  TO THIS GROUP, WE WOULD ADD </p><p>FORMER TABUK GOVERNOR, MAMDUH BIN ABD AL-AZIZ, WHO, </p><p>WHILE ABSENT FROM HAFR, TYPICALLY ACCOMPANIES THE CROWN </p><p>PRINCE AND IS A REGULAR AT ABDULLAH\'S EVENING FAMILY </p><p>MAJLIS.  SIMILARLY, BANDAR AND MISH\'AL BIN ABD AL-AZIZ, </p><p>PASSED OVER IN THE LINE OF SUCCESSION, ARE ALSO </p><p>CONSIDERED NATURAL SUPPORTERS OF THE CROWN PRINCE. </p><p>MISH\'AL TRAVELLED WITH THE CROWN PRINCE TO QASIM FOR THE </p><p>SANG\'S NOVEMBER 1995 TRAINING EXERCISE (REFTEL), WHERE </p><p>ABDULLAH WAS HOSTED BY BANDAR\'S SON, QASIM GOVERNOR </p><p>FAYSAL BIN BANDAR.)  IN ALL, SEVEN OF THE EIGHTEEN </p><p>SURVIVING, NON-SUDAYRI SONS OF KING ABD AL-AZIZ </p><p>TRAVELLED TO HAFR. </p><p> </p><p>O    SONS: </p><p> </p><p>WITH THE EXCEPTION OF KHALID BIN ABDULLAH, WHO WAS </p><p>DISMISSED FROM THE SANG FOLLOWING POLICY DISAGREEMENTS </p><p>WITH HIS FATHER\'S ADVISERS, ALL OF ABDULLAH\'S NINE SONS </p><p>ARE PRESENT IN HAFR AL-BATIN.  TWO SONS, NOT PREVIOUSLY </p><p>RECORDED IN OUR ROYAL FAMILY GENEOLOGY, ARE LISTED: </p><p>MUHAMMAD AND MAJID.  (NOTE: THE LATTER MAY INCLUDE </p><p>ABDULLAH\'S ONE YEAR OLD SON WHO, ACCORDING TO THE CP\'S </p><p>PERSONAL PHYSICIAN, IS A SOURCE OF GREAT PRIDE, COMING </p><p>AS HE DID AFTER A LONG STREAK OF DAUGHTERS.) </p><p> </p><p>O    YOUNGER GENERATION: </p><p> </p><p>IN ADDITION TO PRINCE TURKI BIN ABDULLAH BIN MUHAMMAD </p><p>BIN SAUD AL KABIR, THE ADVISER CUM PRIVATE SECRETARY TO </p><p>THE CROWN PRINCE, ANOTHER GROUP OF THIRD AND FOURTH </p><p>GENERATION PRINCES PRESENT IN HAFR MAY BE ABDULLAH\'S </p><p>SON-IN-LAWS.  ONE WHOM WE CAN POSITIVELY IDENTIFY AS A </p><p>SON-IN-LAW (AND FELLOW EQUESTRIAN ENTHUSIAST) IS THE </p><p>SANG WESTERN COMMANDER WHO REPLACED KHALID BIN ABDULLAH </p><p>-- HRH PRINCE FAYSAL BIN ABDULLAH BIN MUHAMMAD AL SAUD. </p><p>WE ARE NOT CERTAIN ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP OF PRINCE </p><p>FAYSAL BIN THAMIR BIN ABD AL-AZIZ (THE SOLE OFF-SPRING </p><p>OF THAMIR, WHO COMMITTED SUICIDE IN THE U.S. IN 1957 </p><p>FOLLOWING A SEX CHANGE OPERATION) AND PRINCE KHALID BIN </p><p>BANDAR BIN MUHAMMAD BIN ABD AL-AZIZ. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  ABDULLAH\'S ENTOURAGE ILLUSTRATES THE ALLIANCES </p><p>HE HAS FORMED WITHIN THE ROYAL FAMILY AMONG BROTHERS </p><p>WHOSE SENIORITY, IN TERMS OF AGE, IS NOT MATCHED BY </p><p>PREMIER GOVERNMENT POSTINGS.  REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE </p><p>CROWN PRINCE\'S FAMILY SUPPORTERS SHARE THE SAME POLICY </p><p>OBJECTIVES, IT IS CLEARLY IN THE PERSONAL POLITICAL </p><p>INTERESTS OF THESE PRINCELY "HAVE-NOTS," DISADVANTAGED </p><p>BY NON-SAUDI MATERNAL LINEAGE OR A POOR RECORD IN </p><p>GOVERNMENT OFFICE, TO BAND TOGETHER AGAINST THE TIDE OF </p><p>SUDAYRI BROTHERS, NUMERICALLY RICH AND POWERFULLY </p><p>POSITIONED.  AT THE SAME TIME, THEIR INCLUSION IN </p><p>ABDULLAH\'S VACATION RETREAT REINFORCES IN THE PUBLIC </p><p>MIND THAT WHILE THE CROWN PRINCE MAY BE AN ONLY </p><p>(MATERNAL) CHILD, HIS FAMILY BACKING AMONG THE SURVIVING </p><p>SONS OF ABD AL-AZIZ IS SECURE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MABUS </p><p></p></div>
