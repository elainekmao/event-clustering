USMISSION PROVIDES A RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS RAISED IN REF </p><p>A, RELATED TO THE LOCAL AVAILABIITY OF FOOD RESOURCES FOR </p><p>LOCAL/REGIONAL PURCHASE IN THE HORN OF AFRICA AND THE FOOD </p><p>AID PIPELINE FOR ETHIOPIA IN EARLY 2003. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p>QUESTION: WHAT IS THE AVAILABILITY OF FOOD FOR </p><p>LOCAL/REGIONAL PURCHASE FOR FOOD AID IN THE HORN OF AFRICA? </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. PRELIMINARY ESTIMATES BY THE FAO/WFP MISSION PRESENTLY </p><p>UNDERWAY SHOW A 25 PERCENT DECLINE IN NATIONAL "MEHER" (MAIN </p><p>GROWING SEASON) CEREAL AND PULSE PRODUCTION FROM LAST YEAR </p><p>TO THIS YEAR IN ETHIOPIA, RESULTING IN AN ESTIMATED TOTAL </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  05937  01 OF 02  111640Z </p><p>CEREAL AND PULSE PRODUCTION OF 8.95 MILLION MT, A 21 PERCENT </p><p>DECLINE COMPARED WITH AVERAGE PRODUCTION. BASED ON THESE </p><p>ESTIMATES AND AFTER MAKING FURTHER ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT </p><p>BEGINNING AND ENDING STOCKS, 2003 "BELG" (MINOR GROWING </p><p>SEASON) PRODUCTION, SEED REQUIREMENTS AND POST-HARVEST </p><p>LOSSES, COMMERCIAL IMPORTS AND EXPORTS, IT IS PROBABLE THAT </p><p>THERE WILL BE A CEREALS AND PULSES DEFICIT OF ABOUT 2.5 </p><p>MILLION MT IN ETHIOPIA IN 2003. GIVEN OVERALL DECLINE IN THE </p><p>PRODUCTION OF CEREALS IN THE COUNTRY, PRICES CAN BE EXPECTED </p><p>TO FURTHER INCREASE BEFORE THE BELG HARVEST IN JUNE. </p><p> </p><p>3. IN ERITREA, THE FAO/WFP MISSION FORECASTS A CEREALS </p><p>HARVEST OF 74,000 MTS, NEARLY 60 PERCENT BELOW THE AVERAGE </p><p>OF THE LAST TEN YEARS. IN SUDAN, AS PER FAO, PROSPECTS FOR </p><p>2002 CROPS, NOW BEING HARVESTED, ARE GENERALLY UNFAVORABLE. </p><p> </p><p>4. THE GENERAL CONCLUSION IS THAT, GIVEN THE SUBSTANTIAL </p><p>GRAIN DEFICIT ANTICIPATED IN 2003, MOST OF THE FOOD AID </p><p>REQUIRED WILL HAVE TO BE IMPORTED FROM EXTERNAL SOURCES. </p><p>DONORS ARE FREE TO EXPLORE POSSIBLE AVAILABILITY ELSEWHERE </p><p>IN THE GREATER HORN OF AFRICA. IT IS UNDERSTOOD THAT THE </p><p>WORLD FOOD PROGRAM AND THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION PLAN TO </p><p>CONDUCT IN THE NEAR FUTURE A LOCAL CEREAL AVAILABILITY STUDY </p><p>IN ETHIOPIA TO ASCERTAIN THE MAGNITUDE (IF ANY) OF CEREALS </p><p>FOOD AID AVAILABLE LOCALLY, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE </p><p>AVOIDANCE OF A SIGNIFICANT PRICE IMPACT ON LOCAL MARKETS. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p>QUESTION: WILL THE FOOD GAP BE SUFFICIENTLY COVERED BY </p><p>DONORS THROUGH JANUARY 2003? </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  05937  01 OF 02  111640Z </p><p> </p><p>5. IN ETHIOPIA, OUT OF A TOTAL OF OVER 897,000 MT FOOD </p><p>ASSISTANCE REQUIRED IN 2002, ONLY ABOUT 581,000 MT, OR 65 </p><p>PERCENT, WAS OBTAINED FROM DONORS, INCLUDING A CONTRIBUTION </p><p>OF 47,600 MT BY THE ETHIOPIAN GOVERNMENT (GFDRE). DONOR </p><p>RESPONSE TO THE 2002 APPEAL INCREASED FROM AN AVERAGE OF 46 </p><p>PERCENT OF NEEDS DURING JANUARY-JUNE, TO 69 PERCENT DURING </p><p>JULY-DECEMBER. CARRYOVER PLEDGES FROM 2002 ALLOCATIONS ARE </p><p>ESTIMATED AT 70,000 MT. THIS IS ONLY SUFFICIENT TO COVER 64 </p><p>PERCENT OF 109,000 MT REQUIRED IN JANUARY 2003. </p><p> </p><p>6. WITH 2003 FIRST QUARTER NEEDS ESTIMATED AT NEARLY 411,000 </p><p>MT (MONTHLY REQUIREMENTS EXCEEDING 100,000 MT THROUGH JULY), </p><p>FOOD ASSISTANCE IS URGENTLY REQUIRED TO PREVENT A BREAK IN </p><p>THE ETHIOPIA FOOD AID PIPELINE. </p><p> </p><p>7. EQUALLY WORRISOME ARE THE CURRENTLY LOW STOCK LEVELS IN </p><p>THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY FOOD SECURITY RESERVE (EFSR), </p><p>ESTABLISHED IN THE 1980S IN ORDER TO BRIDGE THE PERIOD </p><p>BETWEEN FOOD AID PLEDGES AND FOOD AID ARRIVALS. A FIRM DONOR </p><p>PLEDGE OF FOOD AID GRAIN ALLOWS THE EFSR TO RELEASE A </p><p>CORRESPONDING VOLUME FOR RAPID DISTRIBUTION BY THE GFDRE\'S </p><p>DISASTER PREVENTION AND PREPAREDNESS COMMISSION (DPPC) AND </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ7025 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  05937  02 OF 02  111641Z </p><p>ACTION IO-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AF-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   AMAD-00  CIAE-00 </p><p>      COME-00  CTME-00  INL-00   USNW-00  WHA-00   SRPP-00  EAP-00 </p><p>      EB-00    EUR-00   E-00     UTED-00  VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00 </p><p>      LAB-01   VCE-00   DCP-01   NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OES-00   OIC-02 </p><p>      OMB-01   IRM-00   STR-00   TEST-00  TRSE-00  USIE-00  EPAE-00 </p><p>      ECA-00   PRM-00   DRL-02   SAS-00     /007W </p><p>                  ------------------162B2D  111822Z /38 </p><p>P 111503Z DEC 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO AMEMBASSY THE HAGUE PRIORITY </p><p>SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 7281 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY ADDIS ABABA </p><p>AMEMBASSY ASMARA </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p>AMEMBASSY OTTAWA </p><p>EU MEMBER STATES COLLECTIVE </p><p>AMEMBASSY TOKYO </p><p>USEU BRUSSELS 3000 </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 02 ROME 005937 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FROM U.S. MISSION IN ROME </p><p> </p><p>AMEMBASSY ADDIS ABABA FOR AMBASSADOR BRAZEAL AND USAID </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  05937  02 OF 02  111641Z </p><p>ACTING DIRECTOR PARK </p><p>USDA/FAS NAIROBI FOR FRED KESSEL AND USAID REDSO </p><p>STATE FOR A/S PRM DEWEY, A/S IO HOLMES AND AF/E </p><p>USAID FOR AA/DCHA WINTER, D/DCHA/FFP LLANDIS </p><p>USDA/FAS FOR MCHAMBLISS, RTILSWORTH AND LREICH </p><p>NSC FOR JWDORKEN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS:     EAID, AORC, WFP, UN, PREF, EAGR, EU, ER, ET, NL </p><p>SUBJECT: DUTCH QUESTIONS ON FOOD CRISIS IN THE HORN OF </p><p>AFRICA </p><p> </p><p>NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS (NGOS); THIS "LOAN" FROM THE </p><p>EFSR IS REPAID WHEN THE NEWLY PLEDGED FOOD AID ARRIVES IN </p><p>COUNTRY. </p><p>8.
