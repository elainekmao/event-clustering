(C) SUMMARY: IN A JULY 3 MEETING WITH THE FINANCE MINISTER, </p><p>MURERWA TOLD US THAT HALTING ZIMBABWE\'S ECONOMIC TAILSPIN WAS THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S NUMBER ONE PRIORITY, IN PART AS A RESPONSE TO THE </p><p>STRONG SHOWING OF THE OPPOSITION IN THE RECENT PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>ELECTIONS.  HE COULD NOT PROVIDE US SPECIFICS ON HOW THIS WOULD BE </p><p>CARRIED OUT.  HE ALSO TOLD US THAT WHETHER HE WOULD STAY ON AS </p><p>FINANCE MINISTER WAS STILL IN THE AIR, AND APPEARED TO US TO BE </p><p>READY FOR A CHANGE IN DUTIES.  HE LAMENTED THE RECENT ELECTION </p><p>VIOLENCE, AND MOUTHED THE PARTY LINE THAT THE WHITE FARMERS COERCED </p><p>THEIR WORKERS TO SUPPORT THE MDC.  AT THE HEAD OF FINANCE, IT MAY BE </p><p>TIME FOR A CHANGE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) IN A CALL ON FINANCE MINISTER HERBERT MURERWA ON JULY 3, </p><p>ACCOMPANIED BY ECON/COMM CHIEF AND POLOFF, THE AMBASSADOR WAS </p><p>ADVISED THAT ADDRESSING ZIMBABWE\'S SEVERE ECONOMIC PROBLEMS WILL BE </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT\'S NUMBER ONE PRIORITY.  ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THE MDC\'S </p><p>STRONG SHOWING IN THE JUST COMPLETED PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS WAS DUE </p><p>TO THE ELECTORATES BAD ECONOMIC PLIGHT, THE MINISTER STATED THAT THE </p><p>RULING PARTY KNEW THAT "BREAD AND BUTTER ISSUES" ARE PARAMOUNT. </p><p>"THE PARTY PERFORMED POORLY", MURERWA TOLD US, "BECAUSE OF THE </p><p>PROTEST VOTE AND, ESPECIALLY IN MATABELELAND, BECAUSE THE OPPOSITION </p><p>HAD ENCOURAGED AN ETHNIC SPLIT", A DEVELOPMENT THE MINISTER </p><p>LAMENTED.  THE MINISTER WARNED AGAINST THE DANGERS OF FANNING ETHNIC </p><p>TENSIONS IN ZIMBABWE, AND IMPLIED THAT THE RULING PARTY WOULD NOT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03637  01 OF 02  051257Z </p><p>TOLERATE ANY SUCH ACTIONS FROM THE NEW OPPOSITION PARTY.  MURERWA </p><p>PROCLAIMED THE SAVING GRACES OF THE LONG-STALLED "MILLENIUM ECONOMIC </p><p>RECOVERY PROGRAM", DECLARING THAT IT WOULD "TACKLE THE ROOT CAUSES </p><p>OF INFLATION, CREATE A BETTER ENVIRONMENT FOR FOREIGN DIRECT </p><p>INVESTMENT, RESOLVE THE LAND ISSUE ONCE AND FOR ALL, AND FULFILL THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S GOAL OF CREATING JOBS IN THE URBAN AREAS, ETCETERA, </p><p>ETCETERA."  LIKE THE PLAN ITSELF, THE MINISTER WAS MUM ON JUST HOW </p><p>THESE ADMIRABLE GOALS WOULD BE ATTAINED. WHEN THE POLITICAL OFFICER </p><p>QUESTIONED IF THE GOZ HAD THE ASSETS AND RESOURCES TO EXECUTE AN </p><p>AMBITIOUS LAND PROGRAM AND URBAN JOBS PROGRAM AT THE SAME TIME, THE </p><p>FINANCE MINSTER BEAMED AT US AND DODGED THE QUERY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>WILL HE STAY ON AS FINANCE MINISTER? </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) ON THE MATTER OF HIS POSSIBLE REAPPOINTMENT, MURERWA WAS </p><p>EXTREMELY CIRCUMSPECT.  (COMMENT: IN RECENT DAYS THE RUMOR MILL HAS </p><p>PLACED GIDEON GONO, MANAGING DIRECTOR OF THE COMMERCIAL BANK OF </p><p>ZIMBABWE, AT THE HEAD OF THE SUCCESSION LIST; THOUGH THE JOB\'S VALUE </p><p>AS A REWARD FOR GONO\'S TIRELESS EFFORTS TO SECURE FINANCING FOR THE </p><p>COUNTRY\'S FUEL IMPORTS CAN BE QUESTIONED.  THIS IS BECAUSE THE NEXT </p><p>FINANCE MINISTER WILL FACE THE DAUNTING TASK OF HAVING TO PULL </p><p>ZIMBABWE OUT OF A VERY DEEP ECONOMIC HOLE, WITH INFLATION, A SEVERE </p><p>BALANCE OF PAYMENTS IMBALANCE AND A RUNAWAY BUDGET DEFICIT AS THE </p><p>BIGGEST NEAR-TERM CHALLENGES.  END COMMENT.)  MURERWA JOKED THAT </p><p>PERHAPS BECOMING THE MINISTER OF EDUCATION, SPORTS AND CULTURE WOULD </p><p>BE PREFERABLE, AS THEN HE COULD AT LEAST VISIT ALL THE COUNTRY\'S </p><p>GOLF COURSES. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03637  01 OF 02  051257Z </p><p>THE PATH FORWARD </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) ON A MORE SERIOUS POLITICAL NOTE, THE MINISTER DECLARED THAT </p><p>IT WAS TIME FOR HIS COUNTRY TO HEAL ITS WOUNDS AND MOVE FORWARD. </p><p>THE HISTORIC LAND INEQUALITY ISSUE HAD TO BE SOLVED, AND ZIMBABWE </p><p>PUT BACK ON THE PATH TO GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT.  THE AMBASSADOR MADE </p><p>THE POINT THAT THE UNITED STATES COULD HELP ZIMBABWE DEAL WITH ITS </p><p>ECONOMIC MISTAKES, BUT THE GOVERNMENT\'S HUMAN RIGHT VIOLATIONS </p><p>INFLICTED ON ITS OWN PEOPLE WERE NOT ACCEPTABLE.  THE ECON OFFICER </p><p>ALERTED THE MINISTER TO THE ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS OF THE AFRICAN </p><p>GROWTH AND OPPORTUNITY ACT (AGOA), STATING THAT HUMAN AND DEMOCRATIC </p><p>RIGHTS ISSUES, RATHER THAN MARKET AND OPERATING ENVIRONMENT ISSUES, </p><p>WERE NOW MORE PROBLEMATIC FOR ZIMBABWE.  THE MINISTER ASSURED US </p><p>THAT ENHANCING RELATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES WAS A TOP PRIORITY </p><p>OF HIS GOVERNMENT, AND PROMISED POSITIVE STEPS TO DECISIVELY QUALIFY </p><p>FOR THE BENEFITS OF THE AGOA.  (NOTE: THE MINISTER WAS SURPRISINGLY </p><p>UNINFORMED ABOUT THE PROVISIONS OF THE AGOA DEADLINES, ALTHOUGH HE </p><p>RESPONDED TO ECON/COMM CHIEF\'S POINTS ON THE NEED TO ACT QUICKLY TO </p><p>ENSURE THAT ZIMBABWE QUALIFIES THIS FISCAL YEAR.  END NOTE)  ON THE </p><p>DETAILS OF THE LAND REFORM PROGRAM HE TOLD US WE WOULD HAVE TO TALK </p><p>WITH VICE PRESIDENT MSIKA AND THE MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE.  HE </p><p>FLATLY STATED THAT A DECISION ON DEVALUATION WOULD HAVE TO AWAIT THE </p><p>APPOINTMENT OF A NEW CABINET, WHICH HE EXPECTED TO CONTAIN ABOUT </p><p>HALF NEW FACES.  THE MINISTER CLOSED BY ASSURING US THAT A </p><p>TURNAROUND WAS LOOMING, THOUGH HIS TESTIMONY DELIVERED WITH </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ7965 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  03637  02 OF 02  051541Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   ACQ-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00 </p><p>      SMEC-00  CTME-00  INL-01   DINT-00  DODE-00  DOEE-00  DOTE-00 </p><p>      SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00   EXIM-01  E-00     FAAE-00 </p><p>      FBIE-00  VC-00    FRB-00   H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   ITC-01 </p><p>      LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  OMB-01   OPIC-01 </p><p>      PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    IRM-00 </p><p>      SSO-00   SS-00    STR-00   T-00     USIE-00  FMP-00   PMB-00 </p><p>      DSCC-00  DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /011W </p><p>                  ------------------6A743F  051541Z /45 </p><p>P 051300Z JUL 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 6509 </p><p>INFO SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY LONDON </p><p>USDOC WASHDC </p><p>NSC WASHDC </p><p>DEPTTREAS WASHDC </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 003637 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF, AF/S, AF/EPS, EB/IFD/ODF, EB/TPP/ODC </p><p>TREASURY FOR ED BARBER AND GRACE SONE </p><p>USDOC FOR 2037/ERIC HENDERSON </p><p>STATE PASS USTR/RWHITTAKER </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p>LONDON FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  03637  02 OF 02  051541Z </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/05/05 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, PREL, EAGR, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR CALLS ON FINANCE MINISTER MURERWA AND HEARS </p><p>PARTY PLATITUDES ON A TURNAROUND PLAN </p><p> </p><p>CHARACTERISTIC BONHOMIE, DID NOT SUFFICE TO MAKE US TRUE BELIEVERS. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>POLITICAL VIOLENCE </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) THE MINISTER SAID THE COUNTRY NEEDED TO MOVE FORWARD, AFTER </p><p>ITS RECENT ELECTION SEASON VIOLENCE, AND FOCUS NOW ON ECONOMIC </p><p>RECOVERY.  HE DOWNPLAYED, HOWEVER, THE DEGREE OF VIOLENCE ZIMBABWE </p><p>JUST EXPERIENCED, NOTING THAT SOUTH AFRICA HAS MORE VIOLENCE ON A </p><p>DAILY BASIS THAN ZIMBABWE HAD DURING ITS ELECTION PERIOD.  HE </p><p>CONCEDED THAT THE MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANNGE IS A "NATIONAL </p><p>PARTY" AND HOPED THAT IT WILL WORK WITH THE RULING PARTY TO ADDRESS </p><p>THE COUNTRY\'S ECONOMIC PROBLEMS. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) MURERWA APPEARED TIRED BUT RESIGNED AND NOT QUITE SURE OF </p><p>WHERE HE SHOULD HANG HIS HAT AS THE NEWLY REELECTED MP FOR </p><p>GOROMONZI.  THAT HIS BATTERIES ARE LOW IS NO SURPRISE, AND ALTHOUGH </p><p>ONE OF THE MORE DECENT MINISTERS, A NEW FACE IN HIS CHAIR WOULD BE </p><p>WELCOME BY US; PROVIDED THE PERSON IS COMPETENT, OPEN-MARKET </p><p>ORIENTED, AND NOT MERELY A SYCOPHANT OF THE POLITBURO OR PRESIDENT. </p><p>END COMMENT. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03637  02 OF 02  051541Z </p><p> </p><p>MCDONALD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
