<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 002822 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/13/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, SOCI, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: ISLAMIC ACTION FRONT ANNOUNCES LIST OF 29 </p><p>CANDIDATES FOR PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edward W. Gnehm.  Resons 1.5 (B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.(C) The Islamic Action Front (IAF), the political arm of </p><p>the Muslim Brotherhood, published on May 12 its list of 29 </p><p>candidates running in the June 17 parliamentary elections. </p><p>Press reports called the list "surprising" because of the </p><p>number of new faces on the list at the expense of veteran, </p><p>better known names from the past.  Embassy contacts believe </p><p>that the emergence of the IAF\'s "new breed" of politicians is </p><p>a sign of an internal struggle between the younger and older </p><p>members within the IAF, and evidence that the new generation </p><p>may be gaining an upper hand within the organization. </p><p> </p><p>2.(C) Another cause for surprise is the inclusion of only one </p><p>female candidate, unusual when considering that Jordan\'s </p><p>Elections Law for the first time sets aside six seats in the </p><p>new parliament for women.  Embassy contacts expected the IAF </p><p>to have fielded more female candidates in various lightly </p><p>populated and conservative districts  to increase their </p><p>chances for capturing these new seats.  The new female quota </p><p>will award seats to the six female candidates who receive the </p><p>highest percentage of votes cast.  A number of local </p><p>political observers are now saying that the IAF may have a </p><p>number of "stealth" female candidates who will run as </p><p>independents, rather than formally under the IAF banner. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
