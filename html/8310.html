<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KUWAIT 002291 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EB AND NEA/ARP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/30/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, ETRD, EINV, PREL, IZ, KU, ZP </p><p>SUBJECT: WORKING TO DEVELOP THE ECONOMIES OF IRAQ AND THE </p><p>GULF STATES </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 131981 </p><p> </p><p>     B. KUWAIT 1213 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Richard H. Jones for reason 1.5 (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.(C)  Current GCC trade and investment practices, with a few </p><p>important exceptions, are generally dismal and should not be </p><p>considered as a model for Iraq.  Our goal, in fact, should be </p><p>the opposite: to use our successful efforts in Iraq to become </p><p>a model for GCC economies.  There are, however, a few </p><p>\'success stories\' in the GCC that might be useful to emulate </p><p>in Iraq.  We\'ll leave it to our colleagues to elaborate, but </p><p>from Kuwait, Dubai\'s efforts to become a favorite destination </p><p>of foreign investors and to protect intellectual property </p><p>rights appear to be in the vein of what Iraq needs (but watch </p><p>out for the onerous \'offset\' requirements attached to </p><p>government procurement contracts there).  And Bahrain has </p><p>become a leader in financial services, particularly in the </p><p>areas of bank oversight and supervision. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Finally, the concept of the GCC Customs Union (and the </p><p>eventual monetary union), as dysfunctional as its start-up </p><p>has been, represents an ideal that we should encourage (while </p><p>at the same time trying to lower the external barriers the </p><p>Union presents). </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Reftel requests thoughts on how regional investments </p><p>in Iraq can be encouraged.  We have seen press reports citing </p><p>CPA Ambassador Bremer\'s announcement of a trade finance </p><p>facility fund that will provide support to exporters and </p><p>investors moving their products and funds into Iraq.  We </p><p>reiterate our recommendations (Reftel b) that organizations </p><p>such as OPIC and EXIM take up this role for American firms </p><p>and joint ventures, while at the same time we encourage MIGA </p><p>to do the same on a more global basis.  Finally, Gulf states </p><p>themselves could be encouraged to provide trade and </p><p>investment finance assistance to their nationals with </p><p>training and technical assistance programs that allow </p><p>countries like Kuwait to create its own investment insurance </p><p>agency. </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
