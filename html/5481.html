<p>UNCLAS LAGOS 000265 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR DS/DSS/ITA, DS/IP/AF, DS/DSS/OSAC, DS/IP/CC, </p><p>CA/OCS/ACS, AF/W </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ASEC, KCRM, CASC, PINS, EIND, EPET, PGOV, EINV, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: EXPLOSION IN LAGOS </p><p> </p><p>1.  Sensitive But Unclassified. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  At approximately 1110 on Sunday, February 2, 2003, there </p><p>was an explosion in Idumagbo Street, located between the </p><p>Carter Bridge and Third Mainland Bridge on Lagos Island.  The </p><p>area is a lage market and residential area comprised of two </p><p>and three story business and residential buildings. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  No official Americans live on Lagos Island and no FSN </p><p>staff have been identified as living in this area of Lagos. </p><p>The closest USG facility to the area of the explosion is the </p><p>Consulate\'s Public Affairs Section which is located on the </p><p>opposite end of the island about four miles away.  Three </p><p>buildings reportedly collapsed as a result of the explosion </p><p>and several others are severely damaged.  Julius Berger </p><p>Construction Company was asked to assist with rescue </p><p>operations.   As of 1600 hours local on 3 February, there are </p><p>no known American casualties among the twenty-eight confirmed </p><p>dead, and up to fifty injured. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  Immediately following the explosion "area boys" and </p><p>others began looting a bank that was either at ground zero or </p><p>near the point of detonation.  It took police several hours </p><p>to contain the looting.  Police have reportedly cordoned off </p><p>the area. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  Local Guard Force REACT vehicles were sent to the area to </p><p>ascertain the cause of the explosion.  There are no confirmed </p><p>reports of how the explosion occurred. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  Speculative reports point to several possible causes of </p><p>the explosion.  Initial reports indicated that either </p><p>political motives, an attempt to hide problems at the bank, </p><p>or a bank robbery gone bad were behind the blast.  The police </p><p>bomb squad continues to investigate, but offered RSO the </p><p>possibility that some repairmen caused the explosion while </p><p>drilling a hole and hitting some electrical wires connected </p><p>to a water heater.  Other reports indicate there may have </p><p>been a bomb or a collection of gas cylinders that exploded. </p><p>Immediately after the blast, the Lagos State Governor\'s </p><p>office told CG that a gas cylinder in an area of poorly </p><p>constructed buildings could have been responsible for the </p><p>total collapse of one building and severe damage to others. </p><p>The police are not expected to have conclusive evidence of </p><p>the cause for at least several days. </p><p>HINSON-JONES </p><p></p></div>
