NIEN NOTED </p><p>THESE CONCERNS, INDICATING HE WOULD INFORM COMPETENT </p><p>VIETNAMESE AUTHORITIES REGARDING THE U.S. VIEWS.  ON OTHER </p><p>MATTERS, NIEN QUERIED KELLY ABOUT THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION\'S </p><p>POLICY IN THE ASIA PACIFIC REGION, AND SPECIFICALLY THE U.S. </p><p>STANCE ON CHINA AND RUSSIA.   NIEN SPOKE HIGHLY ABOUT THE </p><p>PROGRESS THE U.S. AND VIETNAM HAVE MADE IN RECENT YEARS AND </p><p>INDICATED THAT THE RATIFICATION OF THE BTA WOULD BRING THE </p><p>RELATIONSHIP "TO A NEW LEVEL."   HE BRIEFLY REITERATED THE </p><p>LONGSTANDING VIETNAMESE POSITION THAT THE U.S. IS </p><p>RESPONSIBLE FOR THE `CONSEQUENCES OF WAR\', AS HAD VICE </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER NGUYEN DINH BIN IN A MORE EXTENSIVE </p><p>BILATERAL ON MAY 17.  NIEN SAID HE LOOKS FORWARD TO THE </p><p>VISIT TO HANOI OF THE SECRETARY IN LATE JULY FOR SENIOR </p><p>ASEAN/ARF MEETINGS.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>2.

(SBU) NIEN, NOTING KELLY WAS THE SENIOR MOST U.S. </p><p>OFFICIAL TO VISIT HANOI SINCE THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION </p><p>ASSUMED OFFICE, ASKED ABOUT U.S. POLICIES IN ASIA AND THE </p><p>PACIFIC, ESPECIALLY THE U.S. STANCE TOWARDS CHINA AND </p><p>RUSSIA.  KELLY RESPONDED THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION WANTS TO </p><p>"REACH OUT AND PARTICIPATE" IN SOUTHEAST ASIA AND SECRETARY </p><p>POWELL PROVIDED INSTRUCTIONS THAT HE WAS TO PAY PARTICULAR </p><p>ATTENTION TO THE MAJOR SOUTH EAST ASIAN COUNTRIES.  HE WAS </p><p>PLEASED THEREFORE TO HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE </p><p>IN THE JUST-CONCLUDED ARF SOM MEETING AND TO HAVE ENGAGED IN </p><p>DIALOGUE WITH THE SOUTHEAST ASIAN SENIOR OFFICIALS.  IN THAT </p><p>REGARD, HE NOTED THAT FRANK DISCUSSIONS HAD TAKEN PLACE IN </p><p>THE MULTILATERALS NOT ONLY OVER MATTERS OF AGREEMENT, BUT </p><p>ALSO IN AREAS OF DISAGREEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) ON RUSSIA, KELLY NOTED THE PRESIDENT AND PRESIDENT </p><p>PUTIN WILL HAVE OPPORTUNITIES TO MEET AND TALK NOT ONLY AT </p><p>THE UPCOMING G-8 IN GENOA, BUT ALSO AT ANOTHER LOCATION IN </p><p>EUROPE IN THE COMING MONTHS.  ON CHINA, KELLY SAID HE HAD </p><p>VISITED BEIJING TWO DAYS EARLIER PURSUING A DIALOGUE WHICH </p><p>INCLUDED A DISCUSSION OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS.  HE SAID THE U.S. </p><p>AND CHINA HAVE MANY ISSUES TO DISCUSS AT BOTH THE HIGH AND </p><p>WORKING LEVELS BUT THAT HE HOPED THESE CAN BE RESOLVED SOON. </p><p>ON NORTH KOREA, KELLY MENTIONED THAT SIMILAR TO THE CLINTON </p><p>ADMINISTRATION, THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION WILL SEEK TO IMPROVE </p><p>RELATIONS WITH NORTH KOREA.  IN THAT REGARD, A REVIEW OF THE </p><p>NORTH KOREA POLICY IS ALMOST COMPLETE. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) TURNING TO VIETNAM, KELLY INDICATED THE BUSH </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  01217  181321Z </p><p>ADMINISTRATION WILL CONTINUE ITS POLICY OF ENGAGEMENT.  IN </p><p>THAT REGARD, THIS ADMINISTRATION ASKED AMBASSADOR PETERSON </p><p>TO `HOLDOVER\'.  NIEN RESPONDED THAT DURING THE AMBASSADOR\'S </p><p>TENURE IN HANOI, THE TWO COUNTRIES HAD SEEN A NUMBER OF </p><p>CONTRIBUTIONS TO BILATERAL RELATIONS.  HE NOTED THAT HE HAS </p><p>HIGH EXPECTATIONS FOR THE FUTURE OF THE RELATIONSHIP.  HE </p><p>POINTED OUT THE EXCELLENT COOPERATIVE WORK OF THE MIA/POW </p><p>PROGRAM AS AN EXAMPLE OF THE "GOOD RESULTS" WHICH CAN FLOW </p><p>FROM THE COOPERATIVE EFFORT. </p><p> </p><p>6.   (SBU) NIEN SAID THAT THE RELATIONSHIP CAN BE ELEVATED </p><p>TO "A NEW LEVEL" AS THE U.S.-VIETNAM BILATERAL TRADE </p><p>AGREEMENT IS RATIFIED BY THE U.S. CONGRESS.  KELLY RESPONDED </p><p>THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS DETERMINED TO MOVE AHEAD WITH THE </p><p>AGREEMENT AS IT IS IN THE INTERESTS OF THE TWO COUNTRIES. </p><p>HE NOTED TRADE MATTERS CAN CREATE DOMESTIC TENSIONS; THE </p><p>PROCESS OF DEALING WITH TRADE ISSUES NEVER WORKS AS EASILY </p><p>AS WE WOULD LIKE.  BUT, HE ADDED, WE HOPE THE PROCESS WILL </p><p>BE DEALT WITH URGENTLY BY THE CONGRESS. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) KELLY SAID THAT SINCE HE HAD MET WITH VICE FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER BIN THE PREVIOUS EVENING A MATTER HAD COME TO HIS </p><p>ATTENTION WHICH MADE "THE ATMOSPHERE FOR THE RELATIONSHIP </p><p>MORE DIFFICULT, NOT NECESSARILY FOR THE BTA, BUT IT DOESN\'T </p><p>HELP THE BTA EITHER."  HE REFERRED IN PARTICULAR TO THE </p><p>ARREST ON MAY 17 OF DISSIDENT CATHOLIC PRIEST NGUYEN VAN LY </p><p>IN HUE FOR VIOLATING THE TERMS OF HIS SURVEILLANCE ORDER AND </p><p>A SEPARATE INTERROGATION OF UNIFIED BUDDHIST CHURCH OF </p><p>VIETNAM (UBCV) MONK THICH QUANG DO BY AUTHORITIES IN HO CHI </p><p>MINH CITY.   KELLY SAID HE HOPED THESE PERSONS CAN BE </p><p>RETURNED TO THEIR RESIDENCES AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 05        HANOI  01217  181321Z </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) NIEN REPLIED THAT THESE INDIVIDUALS HAD VIOLATED </p><p>VIETNAMESE LAWS.  THE VIETNAMESE GOVERNMENT DID NOT WANT TO </p><p>TAKE THE STEPS IT HAD TAKEN.  BUT IT HAD TO DO SO, JUST AS </p><p>LAWS ARE ENFORCED IN OTHER COUNTRIES.  AT THE SAME TIME, HE </p><p>SAID HE WOULD TAKE NOTE OF THESE CONCERNS AND MAKE CERTAIN </p><p>THEY ARE CONVEYED TO THE COMPETENT VIETNAMESE AUTHORITIES. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU) A/S KELLY\'S EXPRESSION OF CONCERN OVER THE ARREST </p><p>OF FATHER LY AND THE SUMMONING OF BUDDHIST MONK THICH QUANG </p><p>DO FOLLOWED UP THE AMBASSADOR\'S SIMILAR POINTS MADE THE </p><p>PREVIOUS EVENING TO THE MFA\'S AMERICAS DESK.  (SEE REFTEL) </p><p>THESE INCIDENTS ARE INDEED TROUBLING.  THE U.S. HAS LAID </p><p>DOWN YET ANOTHER MARKER THAT HUMAN RIGHTS CONCERNS CAN, </p><p>UNFORTUNATELY, NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE VERY POSITIVE </p><p>ENGAGEMENT MOMENTUM IN OTHER AREAS OF THE RELATIONSHIP. </p><p>END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U) A/S KELLY DID NOT HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW </p><p>THIS MESSAGE BEFORE HE DEPARTED FOR BANGKOK ON MAY 18. </p><p> </p><p>PETERSON </p><p></p></div>
