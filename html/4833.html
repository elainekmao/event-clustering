Following is Post\'s draft of the 2003 National Trade </p><p>Estimate for Nigeria. Dept. is requested to provide end-year </p><p>trade and investment data in the trade summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. </p><p>NIGERIA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>TRADE SUMMARY </p><p>In 2002, the U.S. trade deficit with Nigeria was $X.X </p><p>billion, an improvement over the 2001 deficit of $X.X </p><p>billion. U.S. goods exports to Nigeria were $XXX million in </p><p>2002, an increase of XX.X percent from 2001. U.S. goods </p><p>imports from Nigeria were $X.X billion in 2002, a decrease of </p><p>almost XX.X percent from 2001. Nigeria was the United States\' </p><p>XXth largest export market in 2002. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In 2001, the stock of U.S. foreign direct investment in </p><p>Nigeria was $X.X billion, an increase of about XX percent </p><p>from 2000. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>IMPORT POLICIES </p><p>Tariffs </p><p>Tariffs provide the Nigerian government with its second </p><p>largest source of revenue after oil exports. In its last </p><p>major tariff revision in March 2002, the Nigerian government </p><p>cut duties on 123 tariff line items (mostly raw materials and </p><p>capital equipment) to as low as 2.5 percent, while raising </p><p>them on 62 line items (largely finished goods and </p><p>agricultural commodities) to as high as 100 percent. The </p><p>government announced similar cuts and increases--often on the </p><p>same good from year-to-year--in 2000 and 2001. The government </p><p>will likely announce another round of tariff adjustments as </p><p>part of the 2003 budget process. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The arbitrary nature of Nigeria\'s tariffs and uneven </p><p>collection of duties help make the import process difficult </p><p>and expensive and create a severe bottleneck for commercial </p><p>activities.  The problem affects foreign investors, as well, </p><p>and is aggravated by Nigeria\'s high-level of dependence on </p><p>imported goods, both finished products and raw materials. </p><p>High duties create the incentive to avoid tariff payments. </p><p>Common illicit practices include under-invoicing imports, </p><p>"round-tripping" foreign exchange, and smuggling. The gap </p><p>between the official exchange rate for the naira (used for </p><p>most imports) and the parallel market\'s discounted rate </p><p>(between 5 and 20 percent during most of 2002, at 10 percent </p><p>by year\'s end) accentuates the demand for foreign exchange </p><p>and encourages corrupt practices that are difficult to </p><p>eliminate. In general, most leading Nigerian importers of </p><p>high tariff items successfully avoid payment of full tariffs. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Non-tariff trade barriers </p><p>Nigeria appears not to be fully compliant with its WTO </p><p>obligations because of implementation of new non-tariff trade </p><p>barriers.  In 2002, the Nigerian Government imposed new </p><p>non-tariff trade barriers on a number of goods, reversing a </p><p>trend over recent years to eliminate such barriers.  In March </p><p>2002, the government banned the import of vehicles over five </p><p>years old; it also banned used refrigerators, air </p><p>conditioners, and compressors.  Textiles containing </p><p>"hazardous chemicals such as chlorides" were banned early in </p><p>2002, and in September 2002, the government banned all </p><p>imports of printed textiles sold in Nigeria as "African </p><p>Prints."  In August 2002 bans were placed on the import of </p><p>sorghum, millet, wheat flour, cassava, frozen poultry, and </p><p>vegetable oil in. Bans on imports of kaolin, gypsum, mosquito </p><p>repellent coils, used clothing, and bagged cement also remain </p><p>in effect. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Customs barriers </p><p>Nigeria\'s ports continue to be a major obstacle to imports. </p><p>Importers face long clearance procedures, corruption, high </p><p>berthing and unloading costs, and uncertain application of </p><p>customs regulations.   In 2001, the Nigeria Customs Service </p><p>(NCS) began a 100 percent inspection regime at Nigerian ports </p><p>to reduce smuggling and under-valuation of imports.  The NCS </p><p>continues to operate a pre-shipment inspection regime, in </p><p>which contracted shipping inspection companies at the port of </p><p>origin issue inspection reports that their counterparts in </p><p>Nigeria use to create a Clean Report of Inspection for NCS, </p><p>which lists the items shipped, their value, and applicable </p><p>customs duties. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The NCS planned to launch a 100 percent destination </p><p>inspection regime in 2002. Under that regime, the NCS would </p><p>act as the sole entity conducting valuation at Nigerian ports </p><p>of destination. Introduction was delayed after protests from </p><p>importers who feared that without a pre-shipment inspection </p><p>report NCS officials might use the new authority to extract </p><p>additional unauthorized facilitation fees. NCS risk </p><p>assessment and other databases are not yet fully operational, </p><p>another reason for delay. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STANDARDS, TESTING, LABELING, AND CERTIFICATION </p><p>The combination of high import duties and uneven application </p><p>of import and labeling regulations makes legal importation of </p><p>high-value perishable products problematic. Disputes among </p><p>Nigerian agencies over the interpretation of regulations </p><p>often cause import delays.  The frequent changes in customs </p><p>guidelines help slow the movement of goods through the port </p><p>of Lagos, resulting in product deterioration and significant </p><p>losses for importers of perishables. </p><p>The National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and </p><p>Control (NAFDAC), which is charged with protecting the </p><p>Nigerian consumer from fraudulent or unhealthy products, has </p><p>targeted for special attention the illicit importation of </p><p>counterfeit and expired pharmaceuticals, particularly from </p><p>the Far East and South Asia. However, NAFDAC has also on </p><p>occasion challenged legitimate, processed food imports, </p><p>including those from U.S. exporters. NAFDAC\'s severely </p><p>limited institutional capacity to carry out inspection and </p><p>testing contributes to an occasionally heavy-handed or </p><p>arbitrary approach in regulatory enforcement. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Not only do products enter Nigeria without full payment of </p><p>tariffs, many imports do not fulfill the country\'s health, </p><p>labeling, and sanitary standards.  Nigeria\'s rules concerning </p><p>labeling, testing, and sanitary and phytosanitary standards </p><p>are relatively well defined. Regardless of origin, all food, </p><p>drug, cosmetic, and pesticide imports must be accompanied by </p><p>a certificate of analysis from the manufacturer and </p><p>appropriate national authority. Specified animal products, </p><p>plants, seeds, and soils must possess sanitation </p><p>certificates. U.S. exporters may obtain these certificates </p><p>from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.  By law, items </p><p>entering Nigeria must be labeled exclusively in the metric </p><p>system; products with dual or multi-markings will be refused </p><p>entry.  However, products not meeting these criteria can be </p><p>found throughout Nigeria\'s markets.  While U.S. products do </p><p>not appear to be subject to extraordinary restrictions or </p><p>regulations, the widespread use of fraudulent documentation </p><p>by non-U.S. exporters can prejudice the access for U.S. </p><p>exporters.  When the level of illicit, undocumented imports </p><p>for particular products such as frozen chicken exceed that of </p><p>legal imports, meeting stipulated Nigerian standards does not </p><p>necessarily ease access to the Nigerian market. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT </p><p>The Obasanjo Administration has made modest progress on its </p><p>pledge to practice open and competitive bidding and </p><p>contracting for government procurement and privatization. The </p><p>Nigerian Government has succeeded in reducing the most </p><p>blatant forms of corruption, but it has been less successful </p><p>in eradicating back-room maneuvers that bias decisions. </p><p>Particularly in the initial stages of the tendering process, </p><p>the Nigerian Government has demonstrated transparency, </p><p>even-handedness, and, at times, even excessive meticulousness </p><p>in weighing competitive bids.  However, as tenders proceed </p><p>through the decision-making system, the process often becomes </p><p>more opaque. Allegations by unsuccessful bidders of corrupt </p><p>behavior by senior government officials and foreign companies </p><p>are common. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In January 2001, the Government issued new procurement and </p><p>government contract policy guidelines.  The guidelines </p><p>clarify competitive tendering and decision-making procedures, </p><p>define bid security and mobilization fee rules, and provide </p><p>for audits of capital projects.   However, it is alleged that </p><p>to avoid this due diligence process some government agencies </p><p>are tendering contracts the value of which is smaller than </p><p>the threshold amount of one million naira (about $7,700). </p><p>Foreign companies incorporated in Nigeria receive national </p><p>treatment, and government tenders are published in local </p><p>newspapers.  According to Nigerian Government sources, </p><p>approximately five percent of all government procurement has </p><p>been awarded to U.S. companies. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EXPORT SUBSIDIES </p><p>The Nigerian Export Promotion Council (NEPC) and the Nigerian </p><p>Export-Import Bank (NEXIM) administer incentive programs for </p><p>industrial exports that include a duty drawback program, an </p><p>export development fund, tax relief, a capital assets </p><p>depreciation allowance, and a foreign currency retention </p><p>program. However, funding constraints limit the effectiveness </p><p>of these programs. In addition, only favored individuals and </p><p>businesses allegedly have derived any benefit from them. </p><p>Aside from these limited incentive programs, Nigeria\'s </p><p>non-oil export sector firms do not receive subsidies or other </p><p>significant support from the government. Recognizing that </p><p>Nigerian exporters were penalized by the official exchange </p><p>rate, in late 2001 the government agreed to permit exporters </p><p>to repatriate their earnings at an exchange rate slightly </p><p>higher than the official rate, but lower than the parallel </p><p>market rate. Nigeria imposes on foreign oil companies some of </p><p>the stiffest restrictions and fee structures of any in effect </p><p>in the oil producing countries in the world. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In an effort to attract investment in export-oriented </p><p>industries, the Nigerian Government established the Nigerian </p><p>Export Processing Zone Authority (NEPZA) in 1992. Of five </p><p>zones established under NEPZA, only the Calabar and Bonny </p><p>Island (Onne) Export Processing Zones function. NEPZA rules </p><p>dictate that at least 75 percent of production in the zones </p><p>must be exported, although lower export levels are reportedly </p><p>being tolerated. In 2001, the Government converted the </p><p>Calabar Export Processing Zone into a free trade zone; it is </p><p>unclear whether the new designation will help to improve its </p><p>export performance. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In March 2002, the Ministry of Finance established export </p><p>incentives for agricultural cash crops.  Cocoa, groundnuts, </p><p>rubber, cotton, palm oil, gum arabic, and ginger are eligible </p><p>for a five-percent export expansion grant. This program was </p><p>not operational as of January 2003. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS (IPR) PROTECTION </p><p>Nigeria is a member of the World Intellectual Property </p><p>Organization (WIPO) and a signatory to the Universal </p><p>Copyright Convention (UCC), the Berne Convention, and the </p><p>Paris Convention (Lisbon Text). Legislation pending in the </p><p>National Assembly would establish the legal framework for a </p><p>TRIPS compliant IPR system in Nigeria. However, IPR law in </p><p>force does, in principal, afford rightholders a degree of </p><p>protection in compliance with most TRIPS provisions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Following the advent of democracy in 1999, Nigerian </p><p>artists--including writers, filmmaker, and musicians--have </p><p>mounted a campaign calling for more effective copyright </p><p>protection and amendment to existing law. Lawyers active in </p><p>IPR issues formed the Industrial Property Law Interest Group </p><p>(IPLIG) to educate the public and lobby on behalf of </p><p>industrial IPR issues. IPLIG has sponsored several copyright </p><p>conferences and initiated an IPR course at the Lagos Law </p><p>School. Software company representatives continue to work </p><p>directly with the Nigerian Government to reduce the number of </p><p>agencies using pirated software. Nigerian filmmakers formed </p><p>the Proteus Entertainment Agency to challenge copyright </p><p>infringement and promote stronger copyright laws and law </p><p>enforcement. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Despite Nigeria\'s active participation in these conventions, </p><p>its reasonably comprehensive domestic IPR laws, and growing </p><p>interest among individuals in seeing their intellectual </p><p>property protected, piracy is rampant. Counterfeit </p><p>pharmaceuticals, business and entertainment software, and </p><p>music and video recordings, and other consumer goods are sold </p><p>openly throughout the country. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The government\'s lack of institutional capacity to address </p><p>IPR issues is a major constraint to enforcing IPR. The key </p><p>Nigerian institutions suffer from low morale, poor training, </p><p>and limited resources. Neither the Trademarks Office in the </p><p>Ministry of Commerce nor the National Agency for Food and </p><p>Drug Administration and Control, two agencies responsible for </p><p>significant IPR protection, are computerized. Fraudulent </p><p>alteration of IPR documentation is reportedly common, even in </p><p>government offices. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Law enforcement, particularly for patents and trademarks, </p><p>remains weak, and the judicial process is slow and subject to </p><p>corruption. Companies rarely seek trademark or patent </p><p>protection because they generally perceive it as ineffective. </p><p>Nonetheless, recent government efforts to curtail IPR abuse </p><p>have yielded some results. A number of high profile actions </p><p>have been taken against IPR violators. The Nigerian Police, </p><p>working closely with the Nigerian Copyright Commission (NCC), </p><p>has occasionally raided enterprises allegedly producing and </p><p>selling pirated software and videos. However, most raids </p><p>appear to be conducted against small pirates, not large and </p><p>well-connected ones. Moreover, very few cases involving </p><p>copyright, patent, or trademark infringement have been </p><p>successfully prosecuted, and most cases have been settled out </p><p>of court, if any final resolution occurs at all. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Nigeria\'s broadcast regulations do not permit re-broadcasting </p><p>or excerpting foreign programs unless the station has an </p><p>affiliate relationship with the foreign broadcaster. This </p><p>regulation is generally respected. Some cable providers do </p><p>illicitly transmit foreign programs, however. The National </p><p>Broadcasting Commission (NBC) monitors the industry and is </p><p>responsible for punishing infractions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>IPR problems in Nigeria\'s film industry worsened dramatically </p><p>following the government\'s 1981 nationalization of the </p><p>country\'s filmmaking and distribution enterprises, part of </p><p>its campaign to "indigenize" the economy. The legitimate film </p><p>distribution market has yet to recover. Almost no feature </p><p>films have been distributed in the country in two decades, </p><p>and the widespread pirating of foreign and domestic videos </p><p>appears to have discouraged the entry of licensed </p><p>distributors in this medium as well. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SERVICES BARRIERS </p><p>Foreign participation in the services sectors is generally </p><p>not restricted, and regulations provide 100 percent access to </p><p>service sectors including banking, insurance, and securities. </p><p>Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) directives stipulate minimum </p><p>levels of paid-in capital. At least two foreign banks have </p><p>initiated operations in Nigeria in recent years and other </p><p>Nigerian banks have received infusions of foreign capital. </p><p>Professional bodies in engineering, accounting, medicine and </p><p>law define the minimum personal qualifications required for </p><p>participation. Nigeria does not impose limits on expatriate </p><p>employment, except in the oil and gas sector. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>INVESTMENT BARRIERS </p><p>Under the Nigerian Investment Promotion Commission  (NIPC) </p><p>Decree of 1995, Nigeria allows 100 percent foreign ownership </p><p>of firms outside the petroleum sector. Investment in the </p><p>petroleum sector is limited to existing joint ventures or </p><p>production-sharing agreements. Foreign investors may buy </p><p>shares of any Nigerian firm except firms on a "negative list" </p><p>(for example, manufacturers of firearms and ammunition and </p><p>military and paramilitary apparel).  Foreign investors must </p><p>register with the NIPC after incorporation under the </p><p>Companies and Allied Matters Decree of 1990.  The decree </p><p>abolished the expatriate quota system, except in the oil </p><p>sector, and prohibits nationalization or expropriation of a </p><p>foreign enterprise by the Nigerian government except for </p><p>cases determined to be in the national interest. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Despite extensive government efforts led by NIPC to improve </p><p>the country\'s investment climate, disincentives to investing </p><p>in Nigeria continue to plague foreign entrepreneurs. Among </p><p>the hurdles to overcome: high business taxes, confusing land </p><p>ownership laws, activist labor unions, arbitrary application </p><p>of regulations, corruption and extensive crime. There is not </p><p>a tradition supporting the sanctity of contracts, and the </p><p>court system for settling commercial disputes is weak, and </p><p>some believe biased.  Local content restrictions are </p><p>encroaching upon the oil sector; foreign oil companies are </p><p>under pressure to increase procurement from indigenous firms. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Government efforts to eliminate financial crime such as money </p><p>laundering and advance-fee fraud (or "419 fraud" after the </p><p>relevant section of the Nigerian Criminal Code) have grown in </p><p>recent years but are largely ineffective. Meanwhile, fraud, </p><p>theft, and extortion are endemic. With the help of U.S. law </p><p>enforcement agencies, "419" perpetrators are being prosecuted </p><p>by the government. </p><p>International watchdog groups routinely rank Nigeria among </p><p>the most corrupt countries in the world. Yet, Nigeria is now </p><p>beginning to show signs of reversing decades of corruption </p><p>and economic neglect. In general, U.S. investors remain </p><p>cautious about conducting business in Nigeria.  The sale of </p><p>U.S. goods and services to either public or private sector </p><p>enterprises is not restricted.  However, anti-competitive </p><p>behavior throughout the Nigerian economy is endemic, </p><p>affecting U.S. products and services. The export of U.S. </p><p>goods and commodities to Nigeria also suffers from unfair </p><p>trade practices by foreign competitors who are often willing </p><p>to accommodate Nigerian requests for improper documentation </p><p>and payments.  Some U.S. exporters believe sales are lost </p><p>when they refuse to engage in illicit or corrupt behavior. </p><p>Other U.S. businesses with extensive experience in Nigeria </p><p>believe that strict adherence to U.S. Foreign Corrupt </p><p>Practices Act (FCPA) standards is understood by their </p><p>Nigerian business counterparts and ultimately helps these </p><p>U.S. companies minimize their exposure to corruption. </p><p>ELECTRONIC COMMERCE </p><p>The growth of electronic commerce and telecommunications in </p><p>Nigeria, albeit from a low base, offers opportunities for the </p><p>provision of U.S. products and services. While there are no </p><p>trade restrictions that discriminate against U.S. products, </p><p>high technology industries suffer from the same constraints </p><p>noted for more traditional industries. </p><p>ANDREWS </p><p></p></div>
