<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 LAGOS 000739 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CAIRO FOR MAXSTADT, TASHKENT FOR BURKHALTER </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ASEC, EPET, ECON, PINS, PGOV, PARM, PHUM, PREF, SMIG, NI </p><p>SUBJECT:  NIGERIA: AN IJAW\'S VIEW OF THE IJAW-ITSEKIRI </p><p>CONFLICT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Ref:  Lagos 736 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary: On April 6, EconOff heard the Ijaws\' side of </p><p>the story regarding their longstanding conflict with the </p><p>Itsekiris, the subject of reftel.  The Ijaws argue that they </p><p>have a legitimate claim to the land in and about Warri.  Our </p><p>Ijaw interlocutor, who acted as if he spoke for the Ijaws </p><p>collectively, disclosed impatience with negotiations to </p><p>resolve the conflict.  He said the Ijaws have concluded an </p><p>agreement with ChevronTexaco that will enable a modus </p><p>vivendi.   The same cannot be said for the relations between </p><p>the Ijaws and Nigerian military forces in the region. </p><p>Should they interfere with the April 12 and 19 elections, </p><p>the Ijaws will be prepared to oppose force against force. </p><p>End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  Doyah Tiemo, an Ijaw leader and former banker and </p><p>financial consultant, spoke with EconOff on April 6 about </p><p>the Ijaw-Itsekiri conflict.  Tiemo asserted that the </p><p>conflict is about land ownership, as did an Itsekiri contact </p><p>(reftel).  He blamed the Itsekiris, whom he said claim </p><p>exclusive ownership to Warri and its environs and look upon </p><p>Ijaws as settlers or migrant tenants, terms he considers </p><p>derogatory.  According to Tiemo, the Itsekiris found the </p><p>Ijaws already in place when the former arrived in the Warri </p><p>area.  Tiemo said the Ijaw\'s have been in the region since </p><p>1450 so they cannot be characterized as  "settlers". The use </p><p>of the terms tenant or settler thus impedes peace, he said. </p><p>Tiemo asserted that the Ijaws helped the Itsekiris establish </p><p>themselves in the area when it became necessary for the </p><p>first son of the Oba of Ilua to leave Benin.  The Ijaws then </p><p>provided land to him and his 70 chiefs and all settled in </p><p>the Warri area. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  Tiemo doubted that a meeting between members of the </p><p>Ijaws, Itsekiris, and Urhobos on the one hand, and President </p><p>Obasanjo on the other hand, would take place on April 7 </p><p>because the Ijaws had reservations about the list of </p><p>invitees. The Delta State government compiled the list of </p><p>the delegates for the meeting with the President, Tiemo </p><p>said.  Some of the Ijaw youth groups oppose the Ijaw elders </p><p>who figure prominently on the list, people whom they feel </p><p>have sold them out. The youth are also unhappy that the </p><p>proposed delegates have yet to deliver results from </p><p>negotiations on their behalf.  Furthermore, the delegates do </p><p>not appear to have a clear mandate from the Ijaw community </p><p>with respect to what it should expect from the meeting. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. Tiemo said relations between the Itsekiris and Ijaws </p><p>might improve if more local government areas (LGA) were </p><p>established and if they would in turn allow for the economic </p><p>development of areas by the respective ethnic groups.  This </p><p>would mean that the different groups could have their own </p><p>assemblies at the state level.   Tiemo\'s plan calls for the </p><p>creation of three additional LGAs to bring the total to six. </p><p>The Istekiris and Ijaws would then control three LGAs each, </p><p>and a seventh LGA would serve as a central unit and be </p><p>composed of Ijaws, Urhobos, and Itsekiris. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. Tiemo disclosed deep-seated Ijaw grudges against the oil </p><p>companies operating in the region.  He stated that the </p><p>companies "undermine" the Ijaws even though most of the oil </p><p>wells are on their land.  One complaint Tiemo mentioned </p><p>against the oil companies is the alleged insufficient number </p><p>of Ijaws on their work force.  To rectify this situation, </p><p>ChevronTexaco recently agreed to employ as permanent staff </p><p>an Ijaw from each of the ten communities per year for the </p><p>next five years, he said. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  Contrary to the Itsekiri viewpoint (reftel), Tiemo does </p><p>not welcome Nigeria\'s military presence in the area.  He </p><p>opined that should the military forces intervene in the </p><p>conduct of the elections, they will encounter resistance </p><p>from the Ijaw boys, a group of young men 15-20 years old. </p><p>He said the Ijaws are numerous, know the terrain, and are </p><p>better equipped than the military forces in the area.  The </p><p>Ijaws have GSM phones, satellite phones, mobile radio </p><p>equipment, and automatic weapons.  (Comment:  Indeed, both </p><p>the oil companies and the Nigerian military have admitted </p><p>that the Ijaws are far better armed than they realized. End </p><p>commen). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  Tiemo concluded the discussion by reaffirming the Ijaw\'s </p><p>claim to the land disputed by the Itsekiris.  He added that </p><p>all the ethnic groups in the area have to live together </p><p>peacefully since Warri and its environs are the mainstay of </p><p>the country\'s economy.   But making his point that arms and </p><p>other combat equipment are in the hands of Ijaw youth, he </p><p>boasted that most members of the Ijaw community contribute </p><p>money to support them and, with money, the boys have no </p><p>difficulty obtaining what they want. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HINSON-JONES </p><p></p></div>
