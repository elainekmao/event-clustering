<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 05 LONDON 008320 </p><p> </p><p>S/CT FOR REAO </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EI, PGOV, PINR, PREL, PTER, UK </p><p>SUBJECT: UNITED KINGDOM: 2002 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 201772 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) THIS TELEGRAM CONTAINS EMBASSY LONDON\'S CONTRIBUTIONS </p><p>TO THE 2002 "PATTERNS OF GLOBAL TERRORISM" REPORT.  EMBASSY </p><p>INPUT IS KEYED TO REFTEL QUESTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) SIGNIFICANT ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE UK TO SUPPORT THE </p><p>GLOBAL COALITION AGAINST TERRORISM, PARTICULARLY LAW </p><p>ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS TAKEN AGAINST AL-QAIDA OPERATIVES, BUT </p><p>INCLUDING DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS TO BLOCK TERRORIST ASSETS, ENACT </p><p>NEW COUNTER TERRORISM LAWS, RATIFY EXISTING TREATIES. </p><p> </p><p>A) THE UK REMAINS ONE OF THE UNITED STATES\' STRONGEST ALLIES </p><p>IN THE FIGHT AGAINST TERRORISM AND HAS MADE THE ELIMINATION </p><p>OF TERRORISM AS A FORCE IN INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS A PRIMARY </p><p>OBJECTIVE OF ITS FOREIGN POLICY.  THE U.S. AND THE UK </p><p>COOPERATE CLOSELY AND EFFECTIVELY BILATERALLY AND IN </p><p>MULTILATERAL FORA, SUCH AS THE G-8 AND THE UNITED NATIONS, TO </p><p>COUNTER TERRORIST ACTIVITIES.  COUNTER TERRORISM IS A FOCUS </p><p>OF THE UK\'S BILATERAL RELATIONSHIPS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. </p><p>THE UK\'S INTELLIGENCE AND SECURITY AGENCIES HAVE </p><p>SIGNIFICANTLY DEEPENED THEIR WORK AGAINST TERRORISM WITH </p><p>THEIR FOREIGN COUNTERPARTS, ESPECIALLY THE U.S. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE UK WAS INVOLVED FROM THE OUTSET ALONGSIDE THE U.S. IN </p><p>THE EFFORT TO EXPEL AL-QAIDA FROM ITS BASES IN AFGHANISTAN, </p><p>KILL AND CAPTURE ITS OPERATIVES, AND OVERTHROW THE TALIBAN </p><p>REGIME.  THE UK LED THE INTERNATIONAL SECURITY ASSISTANCE </p><p>FORCE (ISAF), WHICH BECAME OPERATIONAL IN FEBRUARY 2002, </p><p>UNTIL TURKEY ASSUMED COMMAND OF ISAF.  IN MARCH 2002, THE UK </p><p>DEPLOYED A 1,700-STRONG FORCE, KNOWN AS TASK FORCE JACANA, TO </p><p>EASTERN AFGHANISTAN FOR FOUR MONTHS.  JACANA WORKED ALONGSIDE </p><p>U.S. FORCES IN THE REGION TO COMBAT AL-QAIDA.  IN 2002, </p><p>BRITISH MILITARY FORCES ALSO PARTICIPATED IN COALITION </p><p>OPERATIONS AIMED AT DENYING AL-QAIDA TERRORISTS AN </p><p>ALTERNATIVE BASE OUTSIDE AFGHANISTAN.  THIS INCLUDED MARITIME </p><p>PATROLS IN THE ARABIAN SEA. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE ANTI-TERRORISM, CRIME AND SECURITY ACT (2001) PROVIDES </p><p>HMG THE POWER TO DETAIN INDEFINITELY IMMIGRANTS AND ASYLUM </p><p>SEEKERS SUSPECTED OF BEING INTERNATIONAL TERRORISTS, BUT WHO </p><p>CANNOT BE REMOVED FROM THE UK IMMEDIATELY.  SINCE THE ACT </p><p>CAME INTO FORCE IN DECEMBER 2001, TWELVE FOREIGN NATIONALS </p><p>HAVE BEEN DETAINED USING ITS POWERS.  OF THE TOTAL DETAINED, </p><p>TWO HAVE VOLUNTARILY LEFT THE UK.  THE OTHER 10 REMAIN IN </p><p>DETENTION. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE PREDECING TERRORISM ACT OF 2000 PROVIDES THE HOME </p><p>SECRETARY WITH THE POWER TO PROSCRIBE FOREIGN TERRORIST </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS AND CREATES A NUMBER OF OFFENSES THAT RELATED </p><p>TO PROSCRIPTION.  THE ACT INITIALLY PROSCRIBED AL-QAIDA AND </p><p>20 OTHER TERRORIST GROUPS.  IN OCTOBER, THE UK PROSCRIBED </p><p>FOUR ADDITIONAL TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS WITH LINKS TO </p><p>AL-QAIDA, INCLUDING JEEMAH ISLAMIYAH, THE ABU SAYYAF GROUP, </p><p>THE ISLAMIC MOVEMENT OF UZBEKISTAN, AND ASBAT AL-ANSAR. </p><p> </p><p>-- AS OF OCTOBER 2002, THE UK HAD FROZEN THE ASSETS OF OVER </p><p>100 ORGANIZATIONS AND OVER 200 INDIVIDUALS, BOTH IN RESPONSE </p><p>TO SPECIFIC UN SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTIONS (UNSCRS) AND </p><p>UNDER UK DOMESTIC MEASURES.    IN RESPONSE TO UNSCRS BOTH </p><p>BEFORE AND AFTER SEPTEMBER 11, 2001, PARTICULARLY AGAINST </p><p>AL-QAIDA AND THE TALIBAN, THE UK FROZE A TOTAL OF $100 </p><p>MILLION IN TERRORIST ASSETS.  MOST OF THESE FUNDS HAVE NOW </p><p>BEEN UNFROZEN AS A RESULT OF AFGHANISTAN\'S LIBERATION, AND </p><p>HAVE BEEN MADE AVAILABLE TO THE LEGITIMATE AFGHAN GOVERNMENT. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE UK IMPLEMENTED UNSCR 1333 ON DECEMBER 19, 2000; UNSCR </p><p>1373 WAS IMPLEMENTED SEPTEMBER 18, 2001; AND UNSCR 1390 WAS </p><p>IMPLEMENTED JANUARY 28, 2002.  BANKS WERE IMMEDIATELY </p><p>INSTRUCTED TO FREEZE THE ASSETS OF ANY NAMES ATTACHED TO THE </p><p>UNSCRS. THE UK IMPLEMENTED THE UN INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION </p><p>FOR THE SUPPRESSION OF TERRORIST FINANCING ON 10 APRIL 2002. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE ANTI-TERRORISM CRIME AND SECURITY ACT (2001) CONTAINS </p><p>SEVERAL PROVISIONS DESIGNED TO HELP THE POLICE AND THE COURTS </p><p>DEPRIVE TERRORISTS OF FINANCIAL RESOURCES.  THE ACT ALLOWS </p><p>POLICE TO SEIZE ANYWHERE IN THE UK FUNDS THAT ARE INTENDED </p><p>FOR USE IN TERRORIST ACTS, ARE RESOURCES OF PROSCRIBED </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS, OR ARE OBTAINED THROUGH TERRORISM.  THE ACT </p><p>ALSO EXPANDS POLICE POWERS TO MONITOR AND FREEZE TERRORIST </p><p>ACCOUNTS, AND REQUIRES BANKS AND OTHERS TO REPORT TO THE </p><p>POLICE ANY MONEY OR PROPERTY SUSPECTED OF BELONGING OR </p><p>DERIVED FROM TERRORIST FUNDS.  FAILURE TO COMPLY MAY RESULT </p><p>IN IMPRISONMENT FOR UP TO 5 YEARS, AND/OR UNLIMITED FINES. </p><p>THE ACT ALSO MAKES IT AN OFFENSE TO LAUNDER TERRORIST FUNDS, </p><p>REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE FUNDS ARE OR ARE INTENDED TO BE </p><p>USED FOR THE HIRE OF ACTS OF TERRORISM.   IT ALSO STRENGTHENS </p><p>PROVISIONS CONTAINED UNDER THE TERRORISM ACT OF 2000, WHICH </p><p>PROHIBITS UK FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS FROM DISCLOSING ANY </p><p>INFORMATION THAT IS LIKELY TO PREJUDICE A POLICE </p><p>INVESTIGATION OR TO DISPOSE OF ANY RELEVANT INFORMATION.  THE </p><p>ANTI-TERRORISM CRIME AND SECURITY ACT 2001 MAY BE SEEN IN </p><p>FULL AT: WWW.HMSO.GOV.UK </p><p> </p><p>-- THE UK HAS INTRODUCED A NEW DOMESTIC REGULATORY REGIME TO </p><p>ENSURE THAT BUREAUX DE CHANGE AND MONEY TRANSMITTERS </p><p>IMPLEMENT MONEY-LAUNDERING REGULATIONS EFFECTIVELY.  THE </p><p>PROCEEDS OF CRIME BILL INTRODUCED IN OCTOBER 2001 REQUIRES </p><p>BUSINESSES IN THESE SECTORS TO FILE A SUSPICIOUS TRANSACTION </p><p>REPORT (STR) WHEN IT IS SUSPECTED THAT A PERSON HERE OR </p><p>ANOTHER PERSON IS LAUNDERING THE PROCEEDS OF ANY CRIME. </p><p>UNDER THE MONEY LAUNDERING REGULATIONS 2001, ALL MONEY </p><p>SERVICE OPERATORS, INCLUDING BUREAUX DE CHANGE AND OPERATORS </p><p>OF ALTERNATIVE REMITTANCE SYSTEMS, ARE REQUIRED TO REGISTER </p><p>THEIR OPERATION WITH CUSTOMS AUTHORITIES, WHICH HAVE THE </p><p>POWER TO INSPECT THEIR OPERATIONS AT ANY TIME.  A COPY OF </p><p>THESE REGULATIONS CAN BE FOUND AT WWW.HMSO.GOV.UK.  THE </p><p>PROCEEDS OF CRIME BILL 2001 REQUIRES FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS </p><p>AND CASH DEALERS TO VERIFY THEIR CUSTOMERS\' IDENTITY AND </p><p>ADDRESS. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE UK IS COMMITTED TO ENSURING THAT ENTITIES, IN </p><p>PARTICULAR NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS, CANNOT BE MISUSED TO </p><p>FINANCE TERRORISM.  THE CHARITY COMMISSION, MANDATED TO </p><p>REGULATE VIRTUALLY ALL CHARITIES IN ENGLAND AND WALES, IS </p><p>EMPOWERED TO INITIATE INVESTIGATIONS OF CHARITIES SUSPECTED </p><p>OF SUPPORTING TERRORISM.  SINCE SEPTEMBER 11, 2001, THE </p><p>COMMISSION HAS CLOSED DOWN TWO CHARITIES FOR SUSPECTED </p><p>SUPPORT OF TERRORISM, AND ANOTHER HAS HAD ITS ASSETS FROZEN. </p><p> </p><p>-- IN NOVEMBER 2001, A MULTI-AGENCY TERRORIST FINANCE TEAM </p><p>(TFT) WAS SET UP IN THE NATIONAL CRIMINAL INTELLIGENCE </p><p>SERVICE TO ASSIST THE UK GOVERNMENT IN CUTTING OFF TERRORIST </p><p>FUNDS.  THE TEAM COMBINES COUNTER TERRORIST AND FINANCIAL </p><p>INTELLIGENCE ANALYSIS EXPERTISE.  THE MAIN FUNCTION OF THE </p><p>TFT IS TO EXAMINE STRS FOR POSSIBLE TERRORIST CONNECTIONS. </p><p>ADDITIONALLY, THE TFT\'S POSITION WITHIN THE EUROPEAN UNION </p><p>WILL ENABLE IT TO IDENTIFY LINKS BETWEEN TERRORIST AND OTHER </p><p>FINANCING.  SINCE ITS FOUNDING, OVER 3,500 DISCLOSURES HAVE </p><p>BEEN REFERRED TO THE TFT. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE UK\'S FINANCIAL SERVICES AUTHORITY, TOGETHER WITH OTHER </p><p>GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, HAVE HELD TWO SEMINARS PROVIDING THE </p><p>UK\'S FINANCIAL SERVICES SECTOR WITH UP-TO-DATE INFORMATION </p><p>AND ADVICE ON STOPPING TERRORIST FINANCING. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE UK DID NOT ENACT MAJOR NEW COUNTER TERRORISM </p><p>LEGISLATION IN 2002.  THE UK HAS RATIFIED ALL 12 UN COUNTER </p><p>TERRORISM CONVENTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) DESCRIBE THE RESPONSE OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM OF THE UK </p><p>TO ACTS OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM AND/OR SIGNIFICANT ACTS OF </p><p>DOMESTIC TERRORISM DURING 2002, INCLUDING ANY HOST GOVERNMENT </p><p>PROSECUTIONS RELATING TO TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>B) UK LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS BEEN EXTREMELY AGGRESSIVE IN EFFORT </p><p>TO DISRUPT AND/OR PROSECUTE INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED IN TERRORIST </p><p>ACTIVITY. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE INVESTIGATION INTO AND PROSECUTION OF SEVERAL </p><p>ALGERIANS DETAINED ON SEPTEMBER 25, 2001 CONTINUES.  MOHAMED </p><p>MEHDI MESLI AND BAGHDAD MEZIANE HAVE BEEN CHARGED UNDER THE </p><p>PROVISIONS OF THE TERRORISM ACT OF 2000 AND WITH CRIMINAL </p><p>OFFENSES UNDER THE UK POLICE AND CRIMINAL EVIDENCE ACT </p><p>(PACE).  UK AUTHORITIES HAVE DETAINED SEVERAL OTHER </p><p>INDIVIDUALS UNDER UK IMMIGRATION LAW IN CONNECTIONS WITH THIS </p><p>INVESTIGATION. </p><p> </p><p>-- IN AUGUST 2002, UK AUTHORITIES PROSECUTED FRANK ETIM, AKA </p><p>SULAYMAN ZAIN-UL-ABIDIN, AKA FRANCIS ASIBONG VINCENT ETIM, </p><p>FOR OFFENSES COMMITTED UNDER THE TERRORISM ACT OF 2000, </p><p>SPECIFICALLY FOR PROVIDING INSTRUCTION OR TRAINING IN THE </p><p>MAKING OR USE OF (A) FIREARMS, (B) EXPLOSIVES, OR (C) </p><p>CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL OR NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND FOR INVITING </p><p>ANOTHER TO RECEIVE INSTRUCTION OR TRAINING.  ETIM WAS </p><p>ACQUITTED, BUT THE PROSECUTION IS AN EXAMPLE OF LAW </p><p>ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS TO TARGET UK-BASED EXTREMISTS BELIEVED TO </p><p>BE INVOLVED IN PROVIDING MATERIAL SUPPORT TO TERRORIST </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>-- UK AUTHORITIES ARE CURRENTLY PREPARING TO PROSECUTE </p><p>ABDULLAH IBRAHIM EL-FAISAL, AKA TREVOR WILLIAM FORREST, AKA </p><p>FAISAL ABDALLAH AL-JAMAIKEE FOR OFFENCES OF 1) INCITEMENT TO </p><p>MURDER AND 2) DISTRIBUTION OF RACIALLY INFLAMMATORY MATERIAL, </p><p>LIKELY TO PROVOKE RACIAL HATRED. </p><p> </p><p>-- UK LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES ARE USING THE "NO FLY LIST" TO </p><p>DETAIN AND INTERVIEW INDIVIDUALS WHO MAY POSE A THREAT TO </p><p>U.S. INTERESTS. </p><p> </p><p>-- UK SECURITY AND LAW ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES DISRUPTED </p><p>NUMEROUS TERRORIST ATTACKS BY DISSIDENT IRISH REPUBLICAN AS </p><p>WELL AS ENGAGED IN VIOLENT STREET CLASHES WITH LOYALIST </p><p>PARAMILITARY GROUPS.  UK AUTHORITIES ARE PREPARING FOR THE </p><p>TRIAL OF REPUBLICAN DISSIDENTS INVOLVED IN AN ATTEMPT TO </p><p>DETONATE A CAR BOMB IN THE CITY OF BIRMINGHAM. </p><p> </p><p>-- HMG CONTINUES ITS INVESTIGATION OF THE 1998 BOMBING IN </p><p>OMAGH, WHICH IS LINKED TO THE REAL IRA AND KILLED 29 PEOPLE. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) DID THE UK EXTRADITE OR REQUEST THE EXTRADITION OF </p><p>SUSPECTED TERRORISTS FOR PROSECUTION DURING THE YEAR? </p><p> </p><p>C) A BILATERAL EXTRADITION TREATY, WHICH ENTERED INTO FORCE </p><p>ON JANUARY 21, 1977, AND A SUPPLEMENTARY TREATY, WHICH </p><p>ENTERED INTO FORCE ON DECEMBER 23, 1986, GOVERN EXTRADITION </p><p>BETWEEN THE U.S. AND THE UK.  THERE HAVE BEEN NO EXTRADITIONS </p><p>IN THE PAST YEAR TO THE U.S. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE UK CONTINUES TO ASSIST WITH THE U.S. REQUEST FOR THE </p><p>EXTRADITION OF KHALED AL-FAWWAZ, ABDEL MOHAMMED ABDEL ABDUL </p><p>BARY, AND IBRAHIM EIDAROUS TO THE U.S. FOR THEIR INVOLVEMENT </p><p>IN THE BOMBING OF THE U.S. EMBASSIES IN EAST AFRICA.  IN </p><p>DECEMBER 2001, THE HOUSE OF LORDS REJECTED THEIR APPEAL TO </p><p>BLOCK THE EXTRADITION, BUT THE THREE MEN HAVE APPEALED THIS </p><p>RULING TO THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE UK COURTS DENIED THE U.S. REQUEST TO EXTRADITE LATFI </p><p>RAISSI, WHO ALLEGEDLY HELPED TRAIN THE SEPTEMBER 11 </p><p>HIJACKERS, BECAUSE THEY DETERMINED THAT THE U.S. HAD NOT </p><p>PRESENTED ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO APPROVE THE REQUEST. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) DESCRIBE ANY SIGNIFICANT IMPEDIMENTS TO UK GOVERNMENT </p><p>PROSECUTION AND/OR EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS. </p><p> </p><p>D) IT IS UK POLICY TO PROSECUTE AND/OR EXTRADITE SUSPECTED </p><p>TERRORISTS WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF UK LAW, THE EUROPEAN </p><p>CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS, THE 1951 CONVENTION ON REFUGEES, </p><p>AND UK ASYLUM LAWS.  UK LAW REQUIRES PRIMA FACIE EVIDENCE IN </p><p>SUPPORT OF AN EXTRADITION REQUEST, AND DOES NOT ALLOW </p><p>EXTRADITION TO OCCUR WHERE THE REQUEST IS BELIEVED TO BE MADE </p><p>FOR THE PURPOSE OF PUNISHING A PERSON ON ACCOUNT OF HIS/HER </p><p>RACE, RELIGION OR POLITICAL OPINION.  UK LAW DOES NOT ALLOW </p><p>THE EXTRADITION OF INDIVIDUALS IF THEY WOULD FACE THE DEATH </p><p>PENALTY.  THE UK HAS BEEN WILLING TO EXTRADITE INDIVIDUALS IF </p><p>IT RECEIVES ASSURANCES THAT THE DEATH PENALTY WOULD BE </p><p>WAIVED. </p><p> </p><p>-- SATISFYING THE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS FOR EXTRADITION CAN BE </p><p>TIME-CONSUMING (UP TO SIX YEARS IN SOME INSTANCES).  IN </p><p>NOVEMBER 2002, THE GOVERNMENT INTRODUCED LEGISLATION TO </p><p>STREAMLINE AND SHORTEN THE UK EXTRADITION PROCESS.  IF </p><p>ADOPTED IT WOULD ELIMINATE DUPLICATION OF HEARINGS AND </p><p>APPEALS THAT ARE PART OF THE CURRENT SYSTEM.  THE PROPOSED </p><p>LEGISLATION ALSO SIMPLIFIES THE RULES ON AUTHENTICATING </p><p>FOREIGN DOCUMENTS SO THAT FAXED DOCUMENTS WOULD BE ACCEPTED </p><p>AS VALID. </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) DISCUSS UK RESPONSES OTHER THAN PROSECUTION.  THESE </p><p>WOULD INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, PUBLIC STATEMENTS BY </p><p>GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS OR OFFICIAL NEWS AGENCIES FOLLOWING A </p><p>TERRORIST INCIDENT (IN OR OUTSIDE THE UK) AND EFFORTS BY THE </p><p>UK TO INVESTIGATE TERRORIST INCIDENTS OR TO ASSIST WITH </p><p>INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM INVESTIGATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>E) SINCE 9/11, THE UK HAS ENGAGED IN A SUSTAINED GLOBAL </p><p>PUBLIC DIPLOMACY CAMPAIGN TO HIGHLIGHT THE GLOBAL NATURE OF </p><p>THE THREAT POSED BY THE AL-QAIDA NETWORK AND TO URGE OTHER </p><p>COUNTRIES TO RESPOND VIGOROUSLY TO TERRORIST INCIDENTS AND </p><p>THREATS. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE UK ASSISTS WITH INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM </p><p>INVESTIGATIONS.  A TEAM FROM THE METROPOLITAN POLICE HAS BEEN </p><p>IN ATHENS WORKING CLOSELY WITH THEIR GREEK COUNTERPARTS TO </p><p>INVESTIGATE THE JUNE 2000 ASSASSINATION OF BRITISH MILITARY </p><p>ATTACH BRIGADIER STEPHEN SAUNDERS AND IN THE WIDER HUNT FOR </p><p>MEMBERS OF THE 17 NOVEMBER TERRORIST GROUP.

(U) DESCRIBE MAJOR COUNTER TERRORISM EFFORTS UNDERTAKEN IN </p><p>2002 BY THE UK, INCLUDING STEPS TAKEN IN INTERNATIONAL FORA. </p><p> </p><p>F) THE UK SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED THE COUNTER TERRORISM </p><p>ASSISTANCE IT PROVIDES TO OTHER COUNTRIES.  THIS INCLUDES </p><p>OPERATIONAL COUNTER TERRORISM TRAINING, SUCH AS BOMB </p><p>DISPOSAL, HOSTAGE NEGOTIATION AND POLICE INVESTIGATIVE </p><p>SKILLS, AND CAPACITY BUILDING PROGRAMS DESIGNED TO HELP </p><p>COUNTRIES DRAW UP THEIR OWN COUNTER TERRORISM LEGAL </p><p>FRAMEWORKS.  MAJOR UK ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS ARE UNDERWAY IN </p><p>SOUTH AND SOUTH EAST ASIA, INCLUDING INDIA, THE PHILIPPINES, </p><p>AND INDONESIA. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE UK ALSO PROVIDES ASSISTANCE TO OTHER COUNTRIES\' LAW </p><p>ENFORCEMENT AND REGULATORY AUTHORITIES FOR TERRORIST </p><p>FINANCING INVESTIGATIONS.  THE UK CONTINUES TO SUPPORT THE </p><p>PROVISION OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND CAPACITY BUILDING IN A </p><p>NUMBER OF OTHER COUNTRIES, AND IS FUNDING PROGRAMS DESIGNED </p><p>TO ADDRESS A RANGE OF ANTI-TERRORIST FINANCING. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE UK ACTIVELY CAMPAIGNED IN INTERNATIONAL FORA, </p><p>INCLUDING THE EU, NATO, G-8, AND UNITED NATIONS, FOR </p><p>COORDINATED GLOBAL EFFORTS TO COMBAT TERRORISM AND ROUTINELY </p><p>LOBBIED UN MEMBER STATES TO RATIFY THE TWELVE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>CONVENTIONS AND PROTOCOL RELATING TO TERRORISM.

(U) DESCRIBE ANY SIGNIFICANT UK SUPPORT FOR INTERNATIONAL </p><p>TERRORISM, TERRORISTS OR TERRORIST GROUPS. </p><p> </p><p>G) HMG DOES NOT PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM, </p><p>TERRORISTS OR TERRORIST GROUPS.  HMG CONSISTENTLY AND </p><p>STRONGLY CONDEMNS ALL ACTS OF AND SUPPORT FOR TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) HAS THE UK MADE ANY PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF A </p><p>TERRORIST-SUPPORTING COUNTRY ON A TERRORISM ISSUE? </p><p> </p><p>H) HMG HAS NOT MADE ANY PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF A </p><p>TERRORIST-SUPPORTING COUNTRY ON A TERRORISM ISSUE AND </p><p>CONSISTENTLY AND STRONGLY CONDEMNS ALL ACTS OF AND SUPPORT </p><p>FOR TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) DESCRIBE U.S. COUNTER TERRORISM EFFORTS AND </p><p>INITIATIVES WITH THE UK, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, </p><p>REQUESTS TO THE UK FOR SPECIFIC COOPERATION AND EFFORTS BY </p><p>THE U.S. IN THE UK TO ELIMINATE INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL </p><p>SUPPORT TO TERRORIST GROUPS DIRECTLY OR IN SUPPORT OF THEIR </p><p>ACTIVITIES. </p><p> </p><p>J) THE UK GOVERNMENT HAS, SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH THE U.S., OR </p><p>SOON AFTER, FROZEN THE ASSETS OF VIRTUALLY EVERY ORGANIZATION </p><p>AND INDIVIDUAL ON THE NOVEMBER 2001 U.S. EXECUTIVE ORDER AND </p><p>SUBSEQUENT ANNEXES.
