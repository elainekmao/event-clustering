<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 SANAA 000521 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR NEA, NEA/ARP, NEA/EX, S/CT, CA, DS/DSS, </p><p>DS/IP/NEA, DS/DSS/ITA, DS/ICI/PII, CENTCOM FOR POLAD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/19/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ASEC, AMGT, PREL, PTER, AADP, CASC, YM, EAC, COUNTER TERRORISM </p><p>SUBJECT: (TFI201) SANAA EAC MEETING MARCH 19 </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. SANAA 516 </p><p>     B. SANAA 511 </p><p>     C. SANAA 398 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edmund J. Hull for Reasons 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p> 1.  (S/NF)  Begin Summary:  The Ambassador convened an </p><p>Emergency Action Committee (EAC) meeting on March 19 to </p><p>assess threat information in light of further information on </p><p>the shooting incident at the Hunt Oil facility in Marib (refs </p><p>a, b and septel) and the Iraq contingency.  Because the </p><p>investigation into the Marib incident is ongoing, a </p><p>determination of motive is premature (septel), as is a </p><p>decision on any recommendation for authorized departure.  EAC </p><p>members decided to go to the StandFast stance at close of </p><p>business March 20, which means that the Embassy will be </p><p>closed, American employees must remain at their assigned </p><p>StandFast locations (Embassy, residence or Alternate Command </p><p>Center) and only cleared FSNs are allowed at the Embassy (ref </p><p>c).  Key offices and personnel represented at the meeting </p><p>included: AMB, DCM, POL/ECON, CONS, ADMIN, PD, RSO, ORCA, </p><p>OMC, SOC YEMEN and RMO. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>Update on Shootings in Marib </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S/NF)  Embassy investigative team in Marib is receiving </p><p>good cooperation from the Yemeni authorities and are </p><p>continuing their investigation.  Conflicting information </p><p>about the perpetrator and an ongoing site visit to the crime </p><p>scene mean that a motive is not yet determined.  The injured </p><p>Canadian was medevaced March 19 after successful surgery on </p><p>March 18 that left him in stable condition.  Embassy is </p><p>providing assistance as needed.  Details reported septel. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>Current Threat Information; </p><p>StandFast 3/20 COB for Iraq Contingency </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S/NF)  ORCA said there was no change to current threat </p><p>information, but continued to recommend caution and indicated </p><p>that a "lone wolf" attack scenario remains the most likely </p><p>(ref a).  SOC said the Central Security Organization had no </p><p>indications of planned demonstrations.  DAO reported that </p><p>airport officials confirmed normal operations with no plans </p><p>to close or curtail in the event of war in Iraq.  EAC members </p><p>discussed airlines continuing to operate.  Pol/E reported </p><p>that Emirates Airlines and Yemenia Airlines planned to </p><p>continue operations. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S/NF)  EAC members discussed the current Centcom </p><p>guidance on force protection condition.  After a discussion </p><p>of likely scenarios and opsec considerations, EAC agreed to </p><p>move to a StandFast posture effective at close of business on </p><p>March 20. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (S/NF)  EAC decided to alert American employees about the </p><p>StandFast decision immediately, while waiting until after the </p><p>March 20 EAC meeting to alert FSNs via a DCM-hosted meeting. </p><p>A declaration of StandFast means the immediate closure of the </p><p>Embassy and curtailment of all but essential operations. </p><p>American employees must remain at their assigned StandFast </p><p>location (Embassy, residence or Alternate Command Center) and </p><p>cannot travel without RSO permission.  FSN access is severely </p><p>limited to a list of essential employees updated daily by </p><p>section heads via the RSO (ref c). </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  The distribution of gas masks and atropine kits will </p><p>be made March 19 by HU and FMO. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (S/NF)  Because of the Marib incident of an employee </p><p>being the killer and the issue of an exposed area for vehicle </p><p>bomb checks in front of the Embassy, EAC decided to end </p><p>parking privileges inside the compound for FSNs effective </p><p>with the shift to StandFast.  FSNs will be asked to park </p><p>their cars along the barricaded median outside the Embassy </p><p>wall to help block sightlines while vehicles are checked. </p><p>After StandFast, the issue will be reviewed to decide whether </p><p>to continue the practice or alter it. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  Admin made arrangements for supplies, including </p><p>mattresses, sheets and toiletries, to be made available for </p><p>those employees remaining in the Embassy during StandFast. </p><p>The cafeteria will be open for breakfast, lunch, dinner and </p><p>weekends.  In addition, Admin has ensured that motorpool </p><p>handled the change to travel via armored vehicles only during </p><p>MoveSafe with DAO\'s able assistance. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>No Immediate Request for Authorized Departure </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  Ambassador continued to ask EAC members to consider </p><p>seriously whether Post should recommend a change to </p><p>authorized departure status.  Ambassador said that without a </p><p>completed investigation and concrete information on motive </p><p>for the Marib incident, the matter should be discussed again </p><p>at the March 20 EAC.  Section heads queried their staff to </p><p>see if who would plan to leave under authorized departure. </p><p>ADM, Pol/Econ, CONS and DAO indicated that none of their </p><p>staff or spouses would plan on leaving under current </p><p>circumstances. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>Warden Messages </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U)  CONS reported that, per Department instruction, a </p><p>Warden Message advising Americans to consider buying plane </p><p>tickets in advance as a precautionary measure would be </p><p>disseminated March 19.  CONS will also work with other </p><p>sections to continue close contact with the airlines and </p><p>airport to stay up to date on available flights. </p><p>HULL </p><p></p></div>
