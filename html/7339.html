<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 OTTAWA 001043 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR WGSARS, OES/PCI, WHA/CAN (RUNNING) </p><p> </p><p>HHS FOR OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY, OFFICE OF </p><p>INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS (STEIGER) </p><p> </p><p>CDC for Global Health Office (Cox) and Epidemiology </p><p>Program Office </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: TBIO, AMED, CA, SARS </p><p>SUBJECT: WGSARS: Canada-wide Status Report April 10 </p><p>(Number 1) </p><p> </p><p>Ref. (A) Toronto 01048 and previous </p><p> </p><p>1. As of April 9, 2003, Health Canada has received </p><p>reports of 242 probable or suspect cases of severe </p><p>acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Canada. There have </p><p>been 10 deaths in Canada. All Canadian cases have </p><p>occurred in persons who have traveled to Asia or had </p><p>contact with SARS cases in the household or in a health- </p><p>care setting.  Health Canada has compiled the following </p><p>figures regarding the SARS outbreak in Canada, accurate </p><p>as of 13:00 EDT, April 09: </p><p> </p><p>2. Number of Cases: </p><p> </p><p>Ontario is reporting 94 probable and 101 suspect </p><p>cases. All cases have occurred in persons who have </p><p>traveled to Asia or had contact with SARS cases in the </p><p>household or in a health-care setting. </p><p> </p><p>British Columbia is reporting 3 probable and 31 </p><p>suspect cases. </p><p>New Brunswick is reporting 2 suspect cases. </p><p>Saskatchewan is reporting 1 suspect case. </p><p>Alberta is reporting 6 suspect cases. </p><p>Prince Edward Island is reporting 4 suspect cases. </p><p> </p><p>3. Health Canada provides the following definitions: A </p><p>"suspect" case of SARS is a person who fits into one of </p><p>the following two categories: a person who develops </p><p>fever and one or more respiratory symptoms, including </p><p>cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, </p><p>within 10 days of returning from travel to areas in </p><p>Asia where SARS cases are being reported, or a person </p><p>who develops fever and one or more respiratory </p><p>symptoms, including cough, shortness of breath or </p><p>difficulty breathing, within 10 days of having had </p><p>close contact with a "probable " case of SARS (i.e. </p><p>within one meter). </p><p> </p><p>4. A "probable" case of SARS is similar to a suspect </p><p>case, but often the case has a more severe illness, </p><p>with progressive shortness of breath and difficulty </p><p>breathing, and in some cases, chest x-rays shows signs </p><p>of atypical pneumonia.  Health Canada emphasizes that </p><p>the above descriptions of a probable and suspect case </p><p>are provided for communication purposes and not for </p><p>scientific purposes. </p><p> </p><p>5. Fatalities: </p><p> </p><p>      10, all clustered in Toronto, Ontario. </p><p> </p><p>6. Provincial Health Status Level: </p><p> </p><p>Reflecting the relative severity of the outbreak </p><p>in Ontario, that province is the only one to have </p><p>declared a provincial Health emergency, doing so on </p><p>March 26th.  Also, on March 26, Ontario made SARS a </p><p>reportable disease under the provincial health statute. </p><p> </p><p>British Columbia added SARS to the list of </p><p>of reportable communicable diseases in B.C. on April 1st. </p><p>While any unusual communicable disease like SARS is </p><p>already considered reportable under the B.C. Health </p><p>Act, SARS was specifically added by name to listing of </p><p>disease under the communicable disease regulations for </p><p>greater surety. </p><p> </p><p>In tiny Prince Edward Island (about the size of </p><p>Delaware), SARS has also been made a reportable disease </p><p>under the province\'s public health act. </p><p> </p><p>In all other provinces, the standard approach has </p><p>been the provincial medical officers of health, in </p><p>coordination with Health Canada, have issued advisories </p><p>to physicians and healthcare workers outlining SARS </p><p>symptoms and "at-risk" indicia, and defining the course </p><p>of action to take. </p><p> </p><p>7. Federal Assistance & Health Asset Deployments: The </p><p>focus of federal assistance is on Toronto, the </p><p>epicenter of the Canadian SARS outbreak. </p><p> </p><p>A Health Canada SARS Team of physicians and nurses </p><p>has been deployed to Pearson International Airport </p><p>(Toronto) to provide information to airline and airport </p><p>staff.  Health Canada has also sent quarantine officers </p><p>to Vancouver and Dorval (Montreal) International </p><p>Airports to support airport staff.  These health </p><p>professionals are monitoring passengers arriving on </p><p>direct flights from Hong Kong, Singapore and Beijing; </p><p>passing out Health Alert Notices to incoming </p><p>passengers; and supporting airport staff.  Health </p><p>Canada staff at Toronto\'s Pearson International </p><p>airports also inform all departing travelers from that </p><p>airport about the symptoms of SARS and advise those who </p><p>have symptoms, or been in contact with a SARS affected </p><p>person, or visited a SARS affected facility, to defer </p><p>travel and seek medical attention. </p><p> </p><p>At the request of Ontario, Health Canada shipped </p><p>10,000 masks to Toronto as a stopgap measure until the </p><p>province receives additional masks from its supplier. </p><p>These masks are part of Health Canada\'s national </p><p>emergency stockpile (National Emergency Stockpile </p><p>System). </p><p> </p><p>Health Canada has deployed a total of 14 personnel </p><p>to Ontario to assist Toronto\'s public health unit and </p><p>the Ontario Ministry of Health with the investigation </p><p>of the SARS cases. Health Canada has also provided </p><p>guidelines for infection control and recommendations on </p><p>actions for public health settings. </p><p> </p><p>Health Canada has provided two mobile x-ray </p><p>machines and processors to Toronto for two isolation </p><p>units that have been set up in non-hospital facilities. </p><p>8.
