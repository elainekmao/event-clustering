SUMMARY:  VIETNAM\'S TEXTILE INDUSTRY ANTICIPATES A BOOST </p><p>IN ORDERS FROM OVERSEAS BUYERS RELUCTANT TO DO BUSINESS IN </p><p>COUNTRIES SUCH AS PAKISTAN AND INDONESIA, IN LIGHT OF THE </p><p>CURRENT SECURITY SITUATION.  THIS IS ACCORDING TO BUSINESS </p><p>PEOPLE IN HO CHI MINH CITY, THE CENTER OF VIETNAM\'S TEXTILE </p><p>INDUSTRY.  ALTHOUGH NO JUMP IN ORDERS HAS YET OCCURRED, </p><p>INDUSTRY EXPERTS STATE THAT IF SECURITY CONCERNS REMAIN </p><p>HEIGHTENED FOR SEVERAL MONTHS, BUYERS COULD SWITCH THEIR </p><p>ORDERS TO VIETNAM (AND OTHER COUNTRIES PERCEIVED AS STABLE </p><p>AND SAFE).  MOST AGREE, HOWEVER, THAT THE BILATERAL TRADE </p><p>AGREEMENT (BTA) AND THE WORLD ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN, WHICH </p><p>STARTED WELL IN ADVANCE OF SEPTEMBER 11, WILL HAVE A MUCH </p><p>STRONGER EFFECT ON THE FUTURE OF THE TEXTILE INDUSTRY HERE. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>THE SHIFT TO VIETNAM MAY BE COMING - OR NOT </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>2. ALTHOUGH BUSINESS IS SLUMPING IN RESPONSE TO THE ECONOMIC </p><p>SLOWDOWN, A NUMBER OF BUSINESS PEOPLE IN VIETNAM\'S TEXTILE </p><p>INDUSTRY INDICATE THAT THEY ALREADY SEE ADDED INTEREST IN </p><p>VIETNAM AS AN ALTERNATIVE SOURCE OF PRODUCTION FOR TEXTILES </p><p>AND GARMENTS IN LIEU OF INDONESIA, PAKISTAN, OR OTHER MOSLEM </p><p>COUNTRIES. ONE FACTORY OWNER HERE NOTED HE HAD BEEN </p><p>CONTACTED BY A BUYER WHO WANTED TO DIVERSIFY PRODUCTION AWAY </p><p>FROM THE MIDDLE EAST, FEARING A LABEL FROM THAT REGION WOULD </p><p>HURT U.S. SALES.  OTHERS HAVE TOLD US THEY HAVE RECEIVED </p><p>INITIAL INQUIRIES, BUT NO SIGNIFICANT NEW BUSINESS YET. </p><p> </p><p>3.  THE INDUSTRY REPS AND EXPERTS WE TALKED TO AGREE THAT IT </p><p>IS TOO EARLY FOR A MAJOR SHIFT IN ORDER PATTERNS.  MORE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HO CHI  01255  080205Z </p><p>NOTICEABLE IS THE OVERALL DROP IN BUSINESS IN THE LAST FEW </p><p>MONTHS.   MANY BLAME THIS DROP - WHICH BEGAN A DOWNHILL </p><p>SLIDE WELL IN ADVANCE OF SEPTEMBER 11 -- ON WORLDWIDE </p><p>ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.  AUTUMN SHOULD BE OUR PEAK PRODUCTION </p><p>SEASON, ONE GARMENT MAKER STATED, BUT FEW PLANTS ARE WORKING </p><p>AT FULL CAPACITY. </p><p> </p><p>4.  ALL STATED, HOWEVER, THAT A SUSTAINED ARMED CONFLICT IN </p><p>AFGHANISTAN (OR ELSEWHERE, FOR THAT MATTER) WILL CAUSE </p><p>BUYERS TO SHIFT THEIR GARMENT ORDERS FROM COUNTRIES WHERE </p><p>THEY FEAR TO TRAVEL OR WHERE THEY BELIEVE THERE IS NO </p><p>GUARANTEE ORDERS WILL BE FILLED, BECAUSE OF INSTABILITY. </p><p>FOR EXAMPLE, LE QUOC AN, THE CHAIRMAN OF VINATEX, A STATE </p><p>OWNED TEXTILE CONGLOMERATE, STATED AT A LOCAL SEMINAR ON THE </p><p>TEXTILE INDUSTRY THAT VIETNAM COULD AND SHOULD SELL ITS </p><p>STABILITY AND SECURITY. </p><p> </p><p>5.  OF COURSE THE BIGGER IMPACT ON VIETNAM IS THE </p><p>RATIFICATION OF THE BTA, WHICH ALLOWS TEXTILE AND GARMENT </p><p>MAKERS TO EXPORT TO THE U.S. WITH LOWER TARIFFS AND --UNTIL </p><p>A TEXTILE AGREEMENT IS IN FORCE --  WITHOUT QUOTAS.  VIETNAM </p><p>CURRENTLY HAS LESS THAN ONE PERCENT OF U.S. TEXTILE AND </p><p>GARMENT IMPORT MARKET, AND LOCAL FIRMS HAVE BEEN GEARING UP </p><p>TO CAPITALIZE ON THIS NEW OPPORTUNITY.  STATE-OWNED VINATEX, </p><p>A CONGLOMERATE OF GARMENT FACTORIES WHICH CONTROLS ABOUT 28% </p><p>OF VIETNAM\'S CURRENT TEXTILE EXPORTS, HAS ALREADY OPENED </p><p>OFFICES IN NEW YORK AND HONG KONG TO INTRODUCE ITSELF TO THE </p><p>U.S. MARKET. </p><p> </p><p>6.  ONE BUSINESSMAN NOTED THAT A SHIFT AWAY FROM INDONESIA </p><p>OR PAKISTAN DOES NOT AUTOMATICALLY MEAN VIETNAM WILL GET THE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HO CHI  01255  080205Z </p><p>BUSINESS.  THERE ARE OTHER MORE ESTABLISHED PRODUCERS WHO </p><p>ARE WELL-POSITIONED TO MAKE GAINS. THIS BUSINESSMAN CLAIMED </p><p>ONE CITY IN CHINA\'S GUANGDONG PROVINCE EXPORTS MORE TEXTILES </p><p>THAN ALL OF VIETNAM.  IT MAY BE EASIER FOR BUYERS TO SHIFT </p><p>THEIR ORDERS TO FACTORIES WHERE THEY ALREADY HAVE </p><p>ESTABLISHED RELATIONSHIPS ON THE GROUND.  ALL THEY WOULD </p><p>HAVE TO DO IS INCREASE CAPACITY. </p><p> </p><p>7.  COMMENT:  VIETNAM\'S TEXTILE COMPANIES ARE SALIVATING AT </p><p>THE OPPORTUNITY OF UNFETTERED ACCESS TO THE U.S. MARKET NOW </p><p>THAT THE BTA IS ABOUT TO GO INTO EFFECT.  SOME HAVE ALREADY </p><p>BEEN EXPORTING TO THE U.S. AND OTHERS ARE GEARING UP FOR THE </p><p>NEW POSSIBILITIES.  IF THEY CAN SELL VIETNAM AS A STABLE, </p><p>SECURE PLACE TO DO BUSINESS, IT SHOULD HELP THEM GET INTO </p><p>THE MARKET.  THEIR STAYING POWER, HOWEVER, WILL BE </p><p>DETERMINED BY WHETHER THEY CAN OFFER COMPETITIVE PRICING AND </p><p>QUALITY - AN OPEN QUESTION. </p><p> </p><p>YAMAUCHI </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
