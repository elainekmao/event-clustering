<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ANKARA 004956 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, EB/IFD AND EUR/SE </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA - MILLS AND LEICHTER </p><p>NSC FOR BRYZA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/05/2008 </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, PGOV, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: MEETINGS WITH CENTRAL BANK GOVERNOR AND TREASURY </p><p>U/S COINCIDE WITH INTEREST RATE CUT, MARKET OPTIMISM </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) CLASSIFIED BY ECONOMIC COUNSELOR SCOT MARCIEL FOR </p><p>REASONS 1.5 (B), (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) SUMMARY: CENTRAL BANK GOVERNOR SERDENGECTI AND </p><p>TREASURY U/S CANAKCI EXPRESSED CAUTIOUS OPTIMISM ABOUT THE </p><p>NEAR-TERM MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK IN MEETINGS WITH EMBOFFS THAT </p><p>COINCIDED WITH A CENTRAL BANK INTEREST RATE CUT.  THE RATE </p><p>CUTS FOLLOWED A TWO-DAY MARKET RALLY SPARKED BY THE IMF\'S </p><p>APPROVAL OF TURKEY\'S FIFTH REVIEW AND A RESCHEDULING </p><p>OF TURKEY\'S 2004 AND 2005 REPAYMENTS TO THE FUND. SERDENGECTI </p><p>THOUGHT THE IMF HAD BEEN SOFT ON THE GOT AND NOTED </p><p>THAT MANY PEOPLE BELIEVE THIS IS DUE TO POLITICAL INFLUENCE </p><p>FROM THE USG.  SERDENGECTI AND CANAKCI AGREED ON THE </p><p>IMPORTANCE OF TIMELY APPROVAL OF THE IMF\'S SIXTH REVIEW. </p><p>REGARDING THE UPCOMING MEETINGS IN WASHINGTON ON THE U.S. </p><p>ASSISTANCE MOU, TREASURY OFFICIALS WOULD ONLY SAY THAT ONE OR </p><p>TWO ISSUES THAT WERE SUBSTANTIVE RATHER THAN MERELY </p><p>TECHNICAL.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>CENTRAL BANK GOVERNOR LESS SKEPTICAL: </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) EMBOFFS PERIODIC MEETING WITH CENTRAL BANK (CB) </p><p>GOVERNOR SUREYYA SERDENGECTI COINCIDED WITH A CENTRAL BANK </p><p>INTEREST RATE REDUCTION OF 3 PERCENTAGE POINTS.  THE RATE CUT </p><p>FOLLOWED A STRONG TWO-DAY RALLY IN THE ISTANBUL </p><p>MARKETS AFTER THE IMF BOARD APPROVED TURKEY\'S FIFTH REVIEW </p><p>AND INFLATION NUMBERS ANNOUNCED OVER THE WEEKEND BEAT </p><p>EXPECTATIONS. </p><p>4.  (C) WITH THE GOVERNMENT HAVING PULLED OFF THE IMF </p><p>APPROVAL AND INFLATION COMING DOWN, THE NORMALLY SKEPTICAL </p><p>SERDENGECTI (STRICTLY PROTECT) AGREED THAT TURKEY HAD A REAL </p><p>OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE RECENT IMPROVEMENT </p><p>IN THE MACROECONOMIC SITUATION.  IN HIS DISCUSSIONS WITH </p><p>GOVERNMENT MINISTERS, SERDENGECTI SAID HE WOULD CONTINUE TO </p><p>STRESS THE IMPORTANCE OF MEETING THE FUND\'S DEADLINES, GIVEN </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT\'S TENDENCY TO BEHAVE AS IF THERE WERE </p><p>NONE.  SERDENGECTI SAID HE WOULD BE TELLING HIS GOVERNMENT </p><p>COUNTERPARTS THAT IF THEY MAKE MORE MISTAKES, TODAY\'S </p><p> RATE CUT WILL BE THE LAST ONE FOR A LONG TIME. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) IN NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE GOT OVER THE FIFTH REVIEW AND </p><p>THE RESCHEDULED 2004-5 REPAYMENTS TO THE FUND, SERDENGECTI </p><p>SAID HE HAD FOUND THE FUND SOMEWHAT SOFT.  HE PASSED ON THAT </p><p>MANY OBSERVERS, ESPECIALLY IN TURKEY, </p><p>BELIEVE THIS IS BECAUSE OF USG INFLUENCE WITH THE FUND, </p><p>POSSIBLY RELATED TO IRAQ. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) SERDENGECTI WAS ENCOURAGED BY THE WEEKEND </p><p>ANNOUNCEMENT OF IMPROVED INFLATION NUMBERS (PRICES ACTUALLY </p><p>FELL SLIGHTLY IN JULY).  ALTHOUGH SOME ANALYSTS ATTRIBUTED </p><p>THE REDUCTION IN INFLATION TO SOFT AGRICULTURAL PRICES OR THE </p><p>STRONG LIRA,  SERDENGECTI NOTED THAT TURKEY HAS EXPERIENCED </p><p>HIGH INFLATION IN THE PAST WHEN THESE CONDITIONS WERE </p><p>PRESENT.  PROVIDED THERE WAS NO NEW CRISIS OR GOVERNMENT </p><p>MISTAKE, THE TURKISH AUTHORITIES HAVE A REAL CHANCE TO </p><p>CONVINCE PUBLIC OPINION THAT INFLATION IS UNDER CONTROL BY </p><p>BRINGING THE INFLATION RATE DOWN TO THE TEENS IN 2004 OR EVEN </p><p>TO THE 12 PERCENT TARGET.  BUT IN ORDER TO SUSTAIN THE </p><p>IMPROVED INFLATION SITUATION, THE GOVERNMENT HAS TO EXERCISE </p><p>STRONG CONTROL OVER FISCAL AND INCOMES POLICIES. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) SERDENGECTI POINTED OUT THAT, IF THINGS GO WRONG, A </p><p>SUDDEN FALL IN THE LIRA WOULD UNDERMINE THE IMPROVED </p><p>INFLATION SITUATION.  PROVIDED THE LIRA REMAINED BELOW TL 1.5 </p><p>MILLION TO THE DOLLAR, THERE WOULD BE NO SERIOUS RISK </p><p>TO THE PROGRESS ON INFLATION. DESPITE MUCH HAND-WRINGING IN </p><p>THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY AND THE GOVERNMENT ABOUT THE </p><p>STRONG LIRA\'S POTENTIAL EFFECT ON EXPORTS, AND THE EU\'S </p><p>DELAYED RECOVERY, SERDENGECTI POINTED OUT TURKEY\'S CONTINUED </p><p>STRONG EXPORT PERFORMANCE. AS FOR THE CAUSES OF THE LIRA\'S </p><p>SURPRISINGLY STRONG PERFORMANCE IN RECENT MONTHS, THE CENTRAL </p><p>BANK HAD FOLLOWED UP ON RUMORS THAT MONEY FROM IRAQ WAS AN </p><p>IMPORTANT FACTOR IN THE LIRA\'S APPRECIATION. ITS CONCLUSION </p><p>WAS THAT SHARPLY-INCREASED BORDER TRADE FROM IRAQ HAS PLAYED </p><p>A ROLE AS IRAQIS SOUGHT A VARIETY OF GOODS </p><p>FROM  SOUTHEAST TURKEY.  BUT THE CENTRAL BANK DISMISSED </p><p>RUMORS THAT SENIOR IRAQI OFFICIALS MIGHT BE MOVING MONEY </p><p>INTO TURKISH LIRA: EVEN IF SADDAM AND OTHER IRAQIS WERE </p><p>MOVING FUNDS THROUGH TURKEY, THEY WERE UNLIKELY TO VIEW </p><p>TURKEY OR TURKISH LIRA </p><p>AS A SAFE HAVEN. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) SERDENGECTI SAID THAT THE CENTRAL BANK HAD HAD TO </p><p>PUT OFF MOVING TO INFLATION TARGETING FROM MONETARY TARGETING </p><p>BECAUSE THE CONDITIONS ARE NOT YET RIGHT.  INSTEAD, IT IS </p><p>USING A SORT OF HYBRID SYSTEM IN WHICH THE USE </p><p>OF BASE MONEY IS A LESS CENTRAL BENCHMARK. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) SERDENGECTI REVEALED THAT THE CENTRAL BANK HAD </p><p>WRITTEN TO THE GOVERNMENT ABOUT POSSIBLE IRREGULARITIES AT </p><p>IMAR BANK SIX YEARS AGO, BUT THAT NO ACTION HAD BEEN TAKEN </p><p>UNTIL RECENTLY.  SERDENGECTI EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT THE </p><p>IMAR PROBLEM MIGHT HURT THE INDEPENDENT BANK REGULATORY </p><p>BODY\'S (BRSA) CREDIBILITY OR HURT CONFIDENCE IN THE BANKING </p><p>SYSTEM, PARTICULARLY WHEN DEPOSITORS REALIZE THEY MAY NOT GET </p><p>THEIR MONEY FOR A LONG TIME.  ON THE POSITIVE SIDE, </p><p>THE REVELATIONS ABOUT IMAR BANK HAVE AT LEAST SLOWED DOWN THE </p><p>UZANS\' POLITICAL MOMENTUM. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>TREASURY CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC ON MACRO OUTLOOK, </p><p>CLOSE-MOUTHED ON BILATERAL ASSISTANCE DISCUSSIONS: </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) IN A SEPARATE MEETING WITH TREASURY UNDERSECRETARY </p><p>IBRAHIM CANAKCI AND DEPUTY DIRECTOR GENERAL MELIH NEMLI, </p><p>CANAKCI AGREED WITH EMBOFFS\' ASSERTION THAT THE GOT NOW HAD A </p><p>REAL OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD ON THE IMF APPROVAL AND </p><p>RECENT MACRO TRENDS, PROVIDED IT QUICKLY PUSHED THROUGH THE </p><p>REFORMS NEEDED TO OBTAIN IMF APPROVAL OF THE SIXTH </p><p>REVIEW.  ACCORDING TO CANAKCI, "HAVING CLARIFIED THE </p><p>FINANCING ISSUES, THE NEXT STEP IS TO CLARIFY THE BUDGET </p><p>PICTURE WITH A CREDIBLE BUDGET FOR 2004."  CANAKCI CLAIMED </p><p>THAT ECONOMY MINISTER BABACAN AND THE PRIME MINISTER NOW </p><p>UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF SECURING TIMELY APPROVAL OF THE </p><p>SIXTH REVIEW IN ORDER TO CONVINCE MARKET PARTICIPANTS </p><p>OF THE GOVERNMENT\'S COMMITMENT TO REFORM.  CANAKCI BELIEVED </p><p>SENIOR GOT OFFICIALS HAD LEARNED FROM THE NEGATIVE </p><p>CONSEQUENCES OF EARLIER DELAYS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU) CANAKCI NOTED THE IMPROVEMENT IN THE DEBT-TO-GDP </p><p>RATIO. THE CURRENT ESTIMATE IS THAT THE RATIO WILL FALL </p><p>TO 69.4 PERCENT AT YEAR-END AS COMPARED TO AN EARLIER </p><p>PROJECTION OF 77.2 PERCENT. THOUGH MOST OF THE IMPROVEMENT </p><p>WAS DUE TO THE APPRECIATION OF THE TURKISH LIRA, THE STATE </p><p>PLANNING ORGANIZATION IS NOW UNOFFICIALLY PROJECTING A </p><p>2003 GROWTH RATE OF SLIGHTLY ABOVE THE PROGRAM TARGET OF 5 </p><p>PERCENT, GIVING HOPE FOR FURTHER IMPROVEMENT IN DEBT/GDP. </p><p>CANAKCI DESCRIBED A RELATIVELY COMFORTABLE GOVERNMENT DEBT </p><p>MANAGEMENT SITUATION FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2003, DUE TO A </p><p>COMBINATION OF LOWER INTEREST RATES AND A HIGH ROLLOVER RATE </p><p>IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR.  TREASURY PROJECTS A ROLLOVER </p><p>RATIO OF 77 PERCENT FOR THE LAST 5 MONTHS OF 2003, AS </p><p>COMPARED TO 92 PERCENT IN THE FIRST SEVEN MONTHS.  IF </p><p>TREASURY CAN BORROW MORE THAN THE $500 MILLION PROJECTED ON </p><p>THE EUROBOND MARKET DURING THE REST OF THE YEAR AND WITH $700 </p><p>MILLION OF  PRIVATIZATION RECEIPTS EXPECTED, TREASURY SHOULD </p><p>BE IN A GOOD POSITION FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2003. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU) ACCORDING TO CANAKCI, TREASURY IS TRYING TO REDUCE </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT\'S FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK PROFILE ON BORROWINGS </p><p>BY BORROWING MORE IN TURKISH LIRA. THE ROLLOVER RATIO ON </p><p>FOREIGN EXCHANGE BORROWINGS, FOR EXAMPLE, WAS </p><p>ONLY 80 PERCENT IN THE FIRST SEMESTER.  CANAKCI AGREED WITH </p><p>EMBOFFS THAT CORPORATE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK BEARS WATCHING. </p><p>CENTRAL BANK ECONOMIST GUVEN SAK HAD RECENTLY ESTIMATED THAT </p><p>THE TOP 100 TURKISH CORPORATIONS HAD A TOTAL OPEN POSITION OF </p><p>$4.5 BILLION.  CANAKCI BELIEVED IT WAS DIFFICULT TO GET A </p><p>GOOD HANDLE ON THESE CORPORATES\' NET </p><p>FOREIGN EXCHANGE POSITION, HOWEVER, AS THEY ALSO HAVE </p><p>SIGNIFICANT ASSETS IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) CANAKCI WOULD NOT BE DRAWN OUT ON WHO WOULD </p><p>PARTICIPATE IN THE GOT\'S DELEGATION TO WASHINGTON THE WEEK OF </p><p>AUGUST 18 TO DISCUSS THE PROPOSED ASSISTANCE MOU.  ACCORDING </p><p>TO CANAKCI, THE MAKE-UP OF THE DELEGATION HAS NOT YET </p><p>BEEN DETERMINED.  WHEN PRESSED ON WHETHER THE GOT SHARED THE </p><p>U.S. VIEW THAT THESE WERE TECHNICAL DISCUSSIONS TO GO </p><p>OVER THE DETAILS OF THE AGREEMENT, NEMLI SAID THERE WERE AT </p><p>LEAST A COUPLE OF ISSUES THAT WERE MORE THAN TECHNICAL, </p><p>BUT WOULD NOT ELABORATE FURTHER.  HE ADDED THAT HE EXPECTED </p><p>THE TALKS TO BE CONCLUDED QUICKLY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEUTSCH </p><p></p></div>
