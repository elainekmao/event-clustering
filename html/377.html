(U)  SUMMARY.  KUWAIT\'S CABINET JULY 29 WELCOMED </p><p>TALKS WITH IRAQ -- NOW SET TO BEGIN IN JEDDAH JULY 31, </p><p>CALLED FOR A "FAIR AND CONCLUSIVE SETTLEMENT," AND </p><p>REJECTED "ALL FORMS OF ARM-TWISTING, INTIMIDATION, AND </p><p>THE USE OF FORCE."  THE CABINET ALSO VOICED ITS APPROVAL </p><p>OF DECISIONS TAKEN BY OPEC TO RAISE OIL PRICES AND WAS </p><p>BRIEFED ON VISITS BY ARAB LEADERS, INCLUDING YASSER </p><p>ARAFAT.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  STATE MINISTER FOR CABINET AFFAIRS DR. </p><p>ABDULRAHMAN AL-AWADI JULY 29 SAID THE CABINET WELCOMED </p><p>PROPOSED TALKS BETWEEN KUWAIT AND IRAQ, NOW SCHEDULED TO </p><p>BEGIN IN JEDDAH JULY 31.  THE CABINET EXPRESSED ITS </p><p>"SINCERE DESIRE" FOR A SUCCESSFUL MEETING WHICH WOULD </p><p>HELP PRODUCE A "FAIR AND CONCLUSIVE SETTLEMENT OF ALL </p><p>OUTSTANDING DIFFERENCES."  THE MINISTERS EXPRESSED </p><p>APPRECIATION FOR ARAB LEADERS\' EFFORTS, ESPECIALLY THOSE </p><p>OF PRESIDENT MUBARAK AND KING FAHD, AND REITERATED </p><p>KUWAIT\'S REJECTION OF "ALL FORMS OF ARM-TWISTING, </p><p>INTIMIDATION, AND THE USE OF FORCE IN SETTLEMENT OF </p><p>DISPUTES AMONG BROTHERS."  (REF A AND B FBIS REPORTS) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  THE CABINET ALSO EXPRESSED SATISFACTION WITH </p><p>RESULTS OF THE RECENT OPEC MINISTERIAL AND HOPED ALL </p><p>MEMBER STATES WOULD ABIDE BY THEIR QUOTAS.  AL-AWADI </p><p>ADDED THAT KUWAIT "ASPIRES" TO RAISE OIL PRICES, BUT </p><p>ONLY WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF A COLLECTIVE AND BINDING </p><p>OPEC AGREEMENT.  HE NOTED THAT INCREASED OIL REVENUES </p><p>WOULD RAISE THE STANDARD OF LIVING IN THE GULF STATES, </p><p>BUT SAID THAT "THE PROCESS OF RAISING PRICES DOES NOT </p><p>TAKE PLACE UNTIL THE EXPERTS SO RECOMMEND."  (COMMENT: </p><p>I.E., UNTIL MARKET CONDITIONS ALLOW IT.  END COMMENT) </p><p>(REF C FBIS REPORT) </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  CROWN PRINCE/PRIME MINISTER SHAIKH SAAD </p><p>AL-ABDULLAH BRIEFED THE CABINET ON RECENT VISITS BY ARAB </p><p>LEADERS TO DISCUSS THE KUWAIT-IRAQ DISPUTE, INCLUDING </p><p>ARAB LEAGUE SECRETARY GENERAL KLIBI (JULY 26), EGYPTIAN </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL ADVISOR OSAMA AL-BAZ (JULY 26), SAUDI </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER SAUD AL-FAISAL (JULY 28), AND PLO </p><p>LEADER YASSER ARAFAT (JULY 29).  THE CROWN PRINCE WILL </p><p>LEAD KUWAIT\'S DELEGATION TO THE JEDDAH TALKS.  THE </p><p>DELEGATION WHICH DEPARTED FOR JEDDAH AT 1000 JULY 31, </p><p>INCLUDES MINSTATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS SHAIKH NASSER </p><p>MOHAMMED AL-AHMED, MFA U/S SULAIMAN MAJID AL-SHAHEEN, </p><p>OIL MINISTER DR. RASHEED AL-AMIRI, JUSTICE MINISTER </p><p>DHARI AL-OTHMAN, AS WELL AS OTHER OFFICIALS FROM THE </p><p>CROWN PRINCE\'S DIWAN, FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND OIL.  (REF D </p><p>FBIS REPORT) </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) DURING THE CABINET MEETING READOUT, AL-AWADI </p><p>SAID THE AGENDA FOR THE JEDDAH MEETINGS WAS KNOWN BY </p><p>BOTH SIDES BUT DIDN\'T EXPAND ON THE SUBJECT.  IN </p><p>RESPONSE TO A QUESTION ON WHETHER THE DISPUTE WOULD BE </p><p>RAISED AT THE UPCOMING OIC MINISTERIAL, HE STRESSED THAT </p><p>KUWAIT WANTS TO SEE THE PROBLEM SOLVED WITHIN AN ARAB </p><p>FRAMEWORK.  (REF E FBIS REPORT) </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  BEFORE DEPARTING KUWAIT MIDDAY JULY 29, ARAFAT </p><p>TOLD REPORTERS HIS MEETINGS WITH THE AMIR AND THE CROWN </p><p>PRINCE HAD BEEN "POSITIVE AND CONSTRUCTIVE."  ISSUES </p><p>DISCUSSED INCLUDED SOVIET JEWISH EMIGRATION TO THE </p><p>OCCUPIED TERRITORIES AND THE UPCOMING JEDDAH TALKS. </p><p>ARAFAT EXPRESSED HOPE THAT THE JEDDAH TALKS WOULD PUT AN </p><p>END TO THE CRISIS THAT "HAS TARNISHED RELATIONS BETWEEN </p><p>ARAB BROTHERS."  (REF F FBIS REPORT) </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  IN OTHER BUSINESS, FINANCE MINISTER SHAIKH ALI </p><p>KHALIFA AL-ATHBI REPORTED ON HIS RECENT TALKS IN MUSCAT </p><p>WITH OTHER MEMBERS OF THE GCC TRIPARTITE COMMITTEE </p><p>CHARGED WITH STUDYING THE IMPACT OF RECENT INTERNATIONAL </p><p>CHANGES IN THE GULF STATE. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  COMMENT.  THE CABINET\'S "ARM-TWISTING" </p><p>STATEMENT WAS LIKELY A RESPONSE TO EDITORIALS OUT OF </p><p>BAGHDAD WHICH CONTINUE TO PRESS IRAQ\'S CASE PUBLICLY AND </p><p>WHICH, KUWAITIS FEEL, DEMAND THAT KUWAIT ACT LIKE A </p><p>DOORMAT IN ITS TALKS WITH IRAQ (REF G AND H FBIS </p><p>REPORTS).  THE CABINET STATEMENTS ARE A SIGNAL TO </p><p>BAGHDAD THAT THE KUWAITIS WILL NOT BE EASILY ROLLED.  WE </p><p>NOTE THAT THE DPM/FM SHAIKH SABAH AL-AHMED AND FINANCE </p><p>MINISTER SHAIKH ALI KHALIFA AL-ATHBI WILL NOT ATTENT THE </p><p>TALKS.  AS FORMER OIL MINISTER AND THE ARCHITECT OF </p><p>KUWAIT\'S OIL POLICY, SHAIKH ALI KHALIFA IS NOT </p><p>WELL-LIKED BY THE IRAQIS AND SO HIS ABSENCE IS POLITIC. </p><p>THE ABSENCE OF ANY FINANCE OFFICIALS AT ALL, HOWEVER, IS </p><p>PROBABLY MEANT AS A SIGNAL THAT THE GOK INTENDS THESE </p><p>TALKS TO BE MORE THAN A NEGOTIATION ON HOW MUCH </p><p>PROTECTION MONEY IT WILL TAKE TO PAY OFF IRAQ FOR THE </p><p>TIME BEING.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HOWELL </p><p></p></div>
