SULLIVAN FOR REASONS 1.5B/D </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) THE AMBASSADOR MET MARCH 8 WITH THE HEAD OF </p><p>THE NIGERIAN ELECTION OBSERVER DELEGATION CHIEF </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  00618  081132Z </p><p>SHONEKAN, THE NIGERIAN ELECTION COMMISSION </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE AND HIGH COMMISSIONER JUTA.  SHONEKAN </p><p>HAD EARLIER BEEN PRESIDENT OBASSANJO\'S SPECIAL </p><p>EMISSARY TO ZIMBABWE FOR THE ABUJA PROCESS AND </p><p>ACCOMPANIED OBASSANJO ON HIS LATE JANUARY VISIT TO </p><p>ZIMBABWE TO MEET WITH PRESIDENT MUGABE AND MDC </p><p>LEADER TSVANGIRAI.  SHONEKAN, WHO SAID HE WAS </p><p>SURPRISED THAT OBASSANJO HAD SELECTED HIM FOR THIS </p><p>ELECTION MISSION, PUT HIS EMPHASIS ON THE NEED FOR </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S ECONOMIC RECOVERY UNDER WHICHEVER </p><p>CANDIDATE WAS ELECTED.  HE RELATED THE COMMITMENTS </p><p>TO END VIOLENCE AND RUN A FAIR ELECTION MADE BY </p><p>PRESIDENT MUGABE DURING HIS JANUARY VISIT. BUT, </p><p>SHONEKAN NOT SEEM TO DRAW THE APPROPRIATE </p><p>CONCLUSIONS ABOUT MUGABE\'S LACK OF GOOD FAITH WHEN </p><p>THE AMBASSADOR OUTLINED THE GOVERNMENT-ORGANIZED </p><p>CAMPAIGN OF TARGETED VIOLENCE AND INTIMIDATION WHICH </p><p>WAS CONTINUING AND THE PROCEDURAL MANIPULATIONS AT </p><p>WORK.  SHONEKAN WAS PLEASED WITH HIS MEETING WITH </p><p>MDC LEADER TSVANGIRAI, AND PARTICULARLY HIS </p><p>WILLINGNESS TO FORM A NATIONAL UNITY GOVERNMENT, BUT </p><p>WAS NOT DISTRESSED ABOUT THE ABSENCE OF INDICATIONS </p><p>OF CONCILIATORY SIGNALS FROM ZANU-PF. </p><p> </p><p>2.(C) THE NIGERIAN ELECTION COMMISSIONER (WE DID NOT GET </p><p>HIS NAME.) AND THE NIGERIAN HIGH COMMISSIONER WERE MORE </p><p>ENGAGED.  THEY EXPRESSED PARTICULAR DISTRESS ABOUT THE </p><p>REPORT THAT TENS OF THOUSANDS OF ARMED FORCES MEMBERS </p><p>HAD VOTED ABSENTEE.  THE ELECTION REGISTRAR HAD </p><p>CONFIRMED TO THEM THAT THIS WAS SO, BUT SAID HE DID NOT </p><p>KNOW UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES THEY HAD VOTED. THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00618  081132Z </p><p>AMBASSADOR CONFIRMED THAT OUR INFORMATION SHOWED THAT </p><p>THEY HAD VOTED UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF THEIR COMMANDING </p><p>OFFICER.  THE ELECTION COMMISSIONER EXPRESSED CONCERN </p><p>OVER THE LAST-MINUTE CHANGES IN ELECTION PROCEDURES AND </p><p>THE HIGH COMMISSIONER EXPRESSED CONCERN WHEN HE RECEIVED </p><p>A CALL FROM HIS ELECTION OBSERVERS IN MUTARE REPORTING </p><p>THAT ZANU-PF ACTIVISTS HAD BEEN GIVEN ELECTION OBSERVER </p><p>BADGES IDENTICAL TO THOSE OF HIS DELEGATION. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) CHIEF SHONEKAN\'S LACK OF ENGAGEMENT IN THE KEY </p><p>ELECTION ISSUES WAS NOTABLE AND WE HAVE LITTLE </p><p>CONFIDENCE IN WHAT RECOMMENDATIONS HE WILL MAKE TO </p><p>PRESIDENT OBASSANJO FOLLOWING THE ELECTIONS.  HE EVEN </p><p>SEEMED TO SHRUG OFF OUR COMMENT THAT PRESIDENTS </p><p>OBASSANJO AND MBEKI HAD THE GREATEST CAPACITY TO </p><p>CONVINCE PRESIDENT MUGABE TO ACCEPT A PEACEFUL </p><p>DEMOCRATIC TRANSITION.   HC JUTA, ON THE OTHER HAND, WAS </p><p>MORE ENGAGED THAN WE HAVE EVER SEEN HIM AND HE MADE A </p><p>POINT OF SUGGESTING THAT WE BE IN CONTACT ON MONDAY TO </p><p>COMPARE NOTES.  WE KNOW THAT JUTA WAS RECENTLY CALLED </p><p>HOME TO RECOMMEND HOW PRESIDENT OBASSANJO COULD BE </p><p>HELPFUL AND HE SEEMS TO BE TAKING THE RESPONSIBILITY </p><p>SERIOUSLY. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
