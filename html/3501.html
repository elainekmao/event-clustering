<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 001831 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR AF AND AF/S </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/14/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: ZIMBABWEAN DIPLOMATIC NOTE POSES MORE QUESTIONS </p><p>THAN ANSWERS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: CHARGE ROBERT E. WHITEHEAD FOR REASONS 1.5 B/D. </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) Embassy received a diplomatic note and statement at </p><p>COB on August 9, before the long Hero\'s Day weekend.  Below </p><p>is the entire text. </p><p> </p><p>Begin text of Diplomatic Note: </p><p> </p><p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Zimbabwe </p><p>presents its complements to the Embassy of the United States </p><p>of America and has the honor to forward a statement in </p><p>response to recent remarks by the US Assistant Secretary of </p><p>State, Mr. Walter Kansteiner. </p><p> </p><p>The Ministry would like to assure the Embassy that the </p><p>Government of Zimbabwe does share the same concerns as the </p><p>United States on such issues as democracy and good governance </p><p>and is willing to engage the Government of the United States </p><p>on such matters.  The Ministry believes however that such </p><p>dialogue will be facilitated by mutual understanding by both </p><p>sides of the dynamics which shape political policies.  It is </p><p>in this vein that the attached statement has been made, for </p><p>onward transmission to the relevant authorities. </p><p> </p><p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Zimbabwe </p><p>avails itself of this opportunity to renew to the Embassy of </p><p>the United States of America, the assurances of its highest </p><p>consideration. </p><p> </p><p>Harare </p><p> </p><p>August 2002 </p><p> </p><p>End text of Diplomatic Note. </p><p> </p><p>Begin text of Statement: </p><p> </p><p>The Zimbabwe Government maintains that there is a concordance </p><p>of views and value systems between the US Administration and </p><p>itself.  It has conducted its relations with the US on this </p><p>basis.  We have always believed that both our countries are </p><p>looking forward to a world where mankind can be freed from </p><p>the misery caused by race, xenophobia, terrorism, hunger, </p><p>disease, and war. </p><p> </p><p>The Government of Zimbabwe is aware that one of the </p><p>historical realities of our time, is that the United States </p><p>is the leading democracy in the world today.  We have </p><p>maintained the hope that the US Administration is prepared to </p><p>lead the world in this regard and that, sooner rather than </p><p>later, the US Administration will assume this role, not only </p><p>for the benefit of larger developed nations, but for the </p><p>developing nations as well. </p><p> </p><p>The Zimbabwe Government has recently become aware that the US </p><p>Administration has attitudes which make it difficult for it </p><p>to relate positively and constructively with Zimbabwe.  These </p><p>attitudes may have a basis somewhere, but we cannot believe </p><p>that they arise from genuine concerns about Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>conduct of its domestic affairs, nor from direct differences </p><p>between the US and Zimbabwe in the manner both regard their </p><p>respective obligations as sovereign governments.  The </p><p>Zimbabwe leadership fought for and introduced national </p><p>freedom and participatory democracy to the country and the </p><p>government has maintained the second longest unbroken record </p><p>as a multiparty democracy in Africa.  It continues to uphold </p><p>the principles of democracy, rule of law and human rights. </p><p> </p><p>The recent remarks by the US Assistant Secretary of State, </p><p>Mr. Walter Kansteiner, 31 July 2002, claiming that democracy </p><p>and human rights were no longer applicable to Zimbabwe, </p><p>appear to reflect what the US Administration would wish to </p><p>say about Zimbabwe, but they do not match the reality of </p><p>governance in Zimbabwe.  It is of grave concern that such </p><p>remarks should be uttered.  They distort the essence of </p><p>Zimbabwe\'s genuine effort to promote democracy, the rule of </p><p>law, equity, and prosperity among its people whom colonial </p><p>racism had impoverished for over a century. </p><p> </p><p>Mr. Roger Winter, the USAID Assistant Administrator visited </p><p>Zimbabwe recently.  He visited Mashonalaland Central, (Tsenga </p><p>Village, Mount Darwin) to see for himself the extent of </p><p>people\'s participation and involvement in the distribution of </p><p>food relief.  Mr. Winter would admit that this visit brought </p><p>him face to face with our governance at work and especially </p><p>the high level of consultation and stakeholder involvement in </p><p>their own local affairs.  It is assumed that Mr. Winter has </p><p>not yet had the opportunity to share his experiences with Mr. </p><p>Kansteiner and we hope that he will have the opportunity to </p><p>do so soon. </p><p> </p><p>Zimbabwe wishes that the concordance of values it has always </p><p>shared with the United States should remain the firm basis </p><p>upon which to build our relations in trade, investment, </p><p>tourism and technical cooperation.  The Zimbabwe Government </p><p>assures the Government of the United States of its highest </p><p>consideration and continued friendship. </p><p> </p><p>End text of Statement. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Comment: Frankly, we were a bit perplexed about the </p><p>timing and substance of this diplomatic note, the cordiality </p><p>of which was not echoed in Mugabe\'s August 12 and 13 speeches </p><p>(septel).  Although we have been frozen out by the MFA since </p><p>the March election, the Americas desk officer delivered this </p><p>note in person, telling us he had been instructed to do so by </p><p>the permanent secretary, who is no America-phile.  Although </p><p>some of the note\'s claims are laughable -- the GOZ "continues </p><p>to uphold the principles of democracy, rule of law, and human </p><p>rights" -- the letter appears to be an overture, a feeler to </p><p>see if we are interested in engaging with the GOZ on issues </p><p>of mutual concern.  Given recent threats by President Mugabe </p><p>and other senior GOZ officials to impose retaliatory </p><p>sanctions on EU and U.S. officials, the note could be a </p><p>last-ditch effort to ward off such action, which the </p><p>professionals at MFA know would only further isolate </p><p>Zimbabwe.  We believe a brief letter of acknowledgment is </p><p>appropriate, stating that the USG has always believed in the </p><p>importance of bilateral dialogue, that we are happy to share </p><p>with them once again our views on the way forward.  We want </p><p>to avoid giving the GOZ the impression, however, that mere </p><p>dialogue, in the absence of significant policy changes, will </p><p>lead to an improved bilateral relationship with us or other </p><p>key international players.  End comment. </p><p>WHITEHEAD </p><p></p></div>
