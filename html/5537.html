<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 KUWAIT 000486 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR INR/R/M, NEA/ARP, NEA/PPD, PA, INR/NESA, IIP/G/NEA- </p><p>SA, INR/B </p><p>WHITE HOUSE FOR PRESS OFFICE </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH, PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p>SECDEF FOR OASD/PA </p><p>CINCCENT FOR CCPA </p><p>USDOC FOR 4520/ANESA/ONE/FITZGERALD-WILKS </p><p>USDOC FOR ITA AND PTO/OLIA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KU, KDMR </p><p>SUBJECT: KUWAIT MEDIA REACTION, 30 JANUARY-5 FEBRUARY: </p><p>KUWAIT SECURITY; US PRESENCE IN KUWAIT; WAR IN IRAQ; AMCIT </p><p>REPATRIATION CASE </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary: For the second time this week, Kuwaiti Islamic </p><p>activist Mohamed al-Mulaifi has offered a carefully worded </p><p>apologia for al-Qaeda\'s terrorist operations based on his </p><p>exegesis of Quranic texts.  Asserting that the Prophet </p><p>Mohammed abided by a truce with the city of Mecca while </p><p>continuing to attack its caravans outside of its walls, </p><p>Mulaifi-who was accused of incitement for referring to the </p><p>killers of a US Marine on Falaika Island in October </p><p>"martyrs"-implies that it is acceptable to both accept the </p><p>US presence in Kuwait and struggle violently against it.  He </p><p>also calls on the government of Kuwait to "deal gently" with </p><p>its extremists and "engage them in dialogue." </p><p> </p><p>On Iraq, blame for Saddam for bringing the region to the </p><p>brink of war contrasts with ambivalence about the US role. </p><p>An MP accuses Americans of over-stepping their bounds in the </p><p>repatriation case of an American-Kuwaiti girl, averring that </p><p>Americans are here to defend Kuwait, "not to control Kuwaiti </p><p>citizens." One Islamist commentator urges jihad in response </p><p>to the "expected American-Jewish war against Iraq." Also, </p><p>alleged comments by the German ambassador to Kuwait that </p><p>removing Saddam from power would be a "disaster for Kuwait" </p><p>leads to reflections on the challenges posed by a post- </p><p>Saddam Iraq. End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. News stories: The lead story was increased security in </p><p>Kuwait, including the deployment of over 4000 police and </p><p>National Guardsmen on the streets of Kuwait. </p><p> </p><p>All newspapers reported Iraqi Vice President Taha Yaseen </p><p>Ramadan\'s threats made on February 1 to initiate suicide </p><p>attacks against Saudi Arabia and Kuwait in response to a </p><p>U.S. attack on Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>Minister of Interior, Mohammed Al-Khaled, stressed that what </p><p>is happening in the region concerns the Iraqi regime and the </p><p>United States, and that Kuwait has nothing to do with it. He </p><p>added that Kuwait is ready regardless to deal with any </p><p>emergency or Iraqi aggression. </p><p> </p><p>On February 2, it was reported that forty-five Iraqi sailors </p><p>were arrested in Kuwaiti regional waters. When the sailors </p><p>refused to return to Iraq they were handed over to the UN </p><p>Iraq-Kuwait Observer Mission (UNIKOM). </p><p> </p><p>Al-Rai Al-Aam reported on February 1 that the Ministry of </p><p>Information will air programs on local and satellite on "the </p><p>legitimacy of the American presence in Kuwait, and its role </p><p>in protecting the country against the dangers of the Iraqi </p><p>regime." Also on February 1, Al-Qabas published a very </p><p>positive two-page spread on U.S. troops in Kuwait, coming as </p><p>a result of the first embed of local media with the U.S. </p><p>military. </p><p> </p><p>Minister of Awqaf and Islamic Affairs, Ahmed Baqer, met with </p><p>mosque imams and preachers reportedly in order to formulate </p><p>a strategy to put an end to extremism. Baqer also asked that </p><p>no cassettes or brochures be distributed in the mosques </p><p>unless they are from the Ministry. </p><p> </p><p>On January 28, Mohammed Yousef Al-Mulaifi, Head of the </p><p>Information Department at the Ministry of Awqaf and Islamic </p><p>Affairs, who was detained after praising the two attackers </p><p>who killed an American Marine on Failaka Island as </p><p>"martyrs," was released without charge, out of "respect for </p><p>the principles of democracy and freedom." The court, </p><p>however, ordered him to pay KD 500, and to sign a written </p><p>commitment that he will "maintain good behavior" for the </p><p>next two years(see para 10). </p><p> </p><p>Al-Rai Al-Aam reported that the Public Prosecutor released </p><p>on KD100 bail (approximately USD 300) two brothers who </p><p>issued a fake I.D. for Sami Al-Mutairi, the man who </p><p>confessed to killing an American civilian contractor in an </p><p>ambush on January 21. The Public Prosecutor argued that the </p><p>brothers issued the I.D. with "good intent," as they did not </p><p>know that Al-Mutairi was not a mosque supervisor as he </p><p>claimed. </p><p> </p><p>On February 1, all newspapers ran the text of the January 30 </p><p>warden message and travel warning to American citizens in </p><p>Kuwait advising Americans to strongly consider leaving </p><p>Kuwait. </p><p> </p><p>3. MP Adnan Abdelsamad wrote in Al-Dustoor, the National </p><p>Assembly\'s weekly newspaper (1/29), that the American </p><p>Embassy and officials at the Ministry of Interior had </p><p>colluded to facilitate the departure from Kuwait of a minor </p><p>Kuwaiti citizen against the will of her father. MP </p><p>Abdelsamad declared that he holds the Minister of the </p><p>Interior responsible for this. He goes on to write, "They </p><p>say [the Americans] are here to protect the sovereignty of </p><p>Kuwait from external dangers, so why would they violate </p><p>Kuwaiti laws? Kuwaiti agreements with the U.S. don\'t include </p><p>controlling Kuwaiti citizens." </p><p> </p><p>4.  "The Security of Kuwait First" </p><p>Lead editorial in independent Al-Anba stated (2/1): "To put </p><p>the security forces on alert is a must under these </p><p>circumstances. The Ministry of Interior was supposed to </p><p>tighten its security measures immediately after the Failaka </p><p>incident. We did not have to wait for the murder of another </p><p>American civilian. The citizens and the expatriates of </p><p>Kuwait will be pleased to see the security forces on the </p><p>streets and they won\'t be bothered by the checkpoints." </p><p> </p><p>5.  "We Must Be Alert" </p><p>MP Abdelmohsen Jamal wrote in independent Al-Qabas (2/1): </p><p>"[C]an the Iraqi regime cause instability in Kuwait? There </p><p>are many people who sympathize with the Iraqi regime and </p><p>therefore we must be alert to any internal attempt that </p><p>could cause any fraction in our society." </p><p> </p><p>6.  "Against the War" </p><p>Liberal Dr. Shamlan Al-Essa, professor of Political Science </p><p>at Kuwait University, wrote in independent Al-Siyassah </p><p>(2/1):  "Many people and movements in Kuwait have expressed </p><p>their rejection to the war. not because of their love for </p><p>Saddam, but rather because they reject on principle the idea </p><p>of waging a war against Arabs and Muslims. They believe that </p><p>the U.S. has undeclared goals in Iraq to fully control </p><p>sources of oil. In principle, we are against the war for </p><p>humanitarian reasons, but at the same time, we are tired of </p><p>the deteriorating Arab situation in the region. therefore, </p><p>there in no harm in any change led by the US." </p><p> </p><p>7.  Liberal weekly Al-Talea published a statement (2/1) by </p><p>Islamist Dr. Ajeel Al-Nashmi, former Dean of the School of </p><p>Sharia and Islamic Studies at Kuwait University, that was </p><p>posted on Al-Jazeera\'s website, inciting confrontation with </p><p>America. Dr. Al-Nashmi\'s statement, as quoted in Al-Talea, </p><p>reads, "As for the expected American-Jewish war against </p><p>Iraq, Muslims should not contribute directly or indirectly </p><p>in endangering the soul of other Muslims. This war is not </p><p>just against Iraq, but against all Muslim countries and </p><p>linked to the Jews\' plans. and should be countered by </p><p>activating the spirit of Islamic jihad." </p><p> </p><p>8.  "If It Wasn\'t For You, Saddam" </p><p>Ali Al-Ajmi wrote in independent Al-Rai Al-Aam (2/2): "If it </p><p>wasn\'t for you, tyrant, there would not be one foreign </p><p>soldier on Kuwait\'s land. You led us to resort to them to </p><p>protect ourselves against your treachery at a time when </p><p>Kuwait looked with disdain on any foreign presence on its </p><p>land. This was one of our political constants. If it wasn\'t </p><p>for your invasion of Kuwait, the door would not have been </p><p>opened for treaties such as Oslo, Madrid, and Camp David II </p><p>to which Arabs were led, humiliated and deprived of free </p><p>will. You opened the door wide to foreign intervention </p><p>thanks to your foolishness and recklessness, and hung Arab </p><p>dignity out to dry." </p><p> </p><p>9.  "Where is The Arab Street?" </p><p>Faisal Al-Qinai wrote in Independent Al-Siyassah (2/2): </p><p>"Regrettably, we have not seen one demonstration in any Arab </p><p>capital to condemn Iraq\'s threats against Kuwait. Nor have </p><p>we heard one statement from the Arab League on this issue. </p><p>This peculiar Arab behavior is what forces us to be more </p><p>friendly to the Americans" </p><p> </p><p>10. In independent Arabic daily Al-Seyassah (2/2), Islamist </p><p>Mohammed Yousef Al-Mulaifi, Head of the Information </p><p>Department at the Ministry of Awqaf and Islamic Affairs, </p><p>presents a theological argument between those who support </p><p>Usama Bin Laden and those who agree with Ahmed Baqer, </p><p>Minister of Awqaf and Islamic Affairs. Baqer\'s argument is </p><p>that killing Americans is forbidden because they have signed </p><p>a covenant with the Muslim people of Kuwait. Al-Mulaifi </p><p>attributes the following argument to Bin Laden\'s followers: </p><p>We agree that it is indeed forbidden to kill infidels with </p><p>whom we have a covenant. Americans have not kept this </p><p>covenant because "they have announced Jerusalem to be the </p><p>eternal capital of the Jews. Can anyone deny that everything </p><p>that is happening to our people in Palestine is because of </p><p>their support? . Are those who came to the land of Muslims </p><p>to impose a war on our neighbors, a war that Muslims don\'t </p><p>want, can you label them as those with whom we have a </p><p>covenant?" Throughout Al-Mulaifi\'s column, he refers to Al- </p><p>Qaeda with the word `terrorist\' between parenthesis and </p><p>followed by an exclamation mark. </p><p> </p><p>11.  How Do We Stop Al-Qaeda Operations? </p><p>Islamist Mohammad Al-Mulaifi wrote in independent Al- </p><p>Seyassah (2/5): "Al-Qaeda operations, called `guerrilla </p><p>warfare,\' have become the alternative to an inclusive </p><p>confrontation after their failure in Afghanistan. This type </p><p>of war is a based on the strategy used by the Companion of </p><p>the Prophet (Sahabi), Abu Bussair, to defeat the infidels of </p><p>Quraish. [I]s this strategy applicable to defeating the </p><p>enemies of Islam today? In fact, one of the biggest mistakes </p><p>that Muslims commit is taking religious texts out of context </p><p>to serve their own needs and interests. Anti-terrorism </p><p>campaigns will not stop these operations because those who </p><p>believe that they should sacrifice their blood for their </p><p>beliefs will not be frightened. Therefore, let us put aside </p><p>the strategy of violence and adopt the strategy of dialogue. </p><p> </p><p>12. "Dr. Daum\'s Warning" </p><p>Ahmad Al-Dayain wrote in independent Al-Rai Al-Aam (2/4): </p><p>"The German Ambassador to Kuwait, Dr. Daum, stated in a </p><p>seminar held by Kuwait University\'s Gulf and Arab Peninsula </p><p>Studies Center that ousting Saddam will be a great disaster </p><p>for Kuwait, resulting in the waiving of Iraq\'s debts and </p><p>compensations to Kuwait. The Ambassador\'s statement does not </p><p>mean that Saddam\'s presence is the best solution for Kuwait, </p><p>but it simply means that his ouster will impose new </p><p>challenges on us. [including] requests for Kuwait to </p><p>contribute to the rehabilitation of Iraq; expansion of </p><p>Iraq\'s marine outlets to the Arabian Gulf; the nature of </p><p>Kuwaiti relations with a new Iraqi regime." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>URBANCIC </p><p></p></div>
