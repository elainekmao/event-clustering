<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ROME 000081 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EUR/WE AND EUR/SCE </p><p></p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/07/2022 </p><p>TAGS: EU, IT, PGOV, PREL, ITALIAN POLITICS </p><p>SUBJECT: AN INSIDER\'S VIEW OF RUGGIERO\'S SACKING </p><p> </p><p>REF: 2001 ROME 06753 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: A/POL MINISTER COUNSELOR GARY ROBBINS. </p><p>REASON: 1.6 X.6 </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>GOOD RIDDANCE </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  ON 7 JANUARY, THE HEAD OF THE MFA\'S BALKAN OFFICE, </p><p>MAURIZIO MASSARI (STRICTLY PROTECT) TOLD POLOFF THAT HE WAS </p><p>"NOT SORRY TO SEE FORMER FM RUGGIERO GO," AND THAT THIS VIEW </p><p>WAS SHARED BE MANY AT HIS LEVEL (ROUGHLY, THE EQUIVALENT OF </p><p>OFFICE DIRECTOR IN THE DOS).  MASSARI SAID THAT THERE WAS </p><p>SOME "BITTERNESS" AMONG HIS COLLEAGUES OVER THE "LOST </p><p>OPPORTUNITY" CAUSED BY RUGGIERO\'S PUBLIC BICKERING WITH HIS </p><p>BOSS AND REFUSAL TO CONSULT WITH HIS FELLOW MINISTERS OVER </p><p>MATTERS OF GOVERNMENT POLICY.  RUGGIERO COULD HAVE USED HIS </p><p>REPUTATION AMONG OTHER EURO-MINISTERS AND HIS SKILLS AS AN </p><p>ACCOMPLISHED DIPLOMAT TO ADVANCE ITALY\'S STANDING AS A WORLD </p><p>LEADER.  THAT CHANCE WAS LOST WHEN RUGGIERO REFUSED TO PLAY </p><p>THE POLITICAL GAME.  MASSARI ALSO CONFIRMED OUR VIEWS, </p><p>REPORTED SEPTEL, THAT RUGGIERO\'S DEPARTURE WAS A REFLECTION </p><p>OF INTER-GOVERNMENTAL AND PERSONALITY CLASHES, AND DID NOT </p><p>REFLECT ANY MOVEMENT TOWARDS A MORE ISOLATIONIST, LESS </p><p>PRO-EUROPEAN FOREIGN POLICY BY THE GOI. </p><p></p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>HE\'S NO DINI </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  MASSARI COMPARED RUGGIERO\'S PERFORMANCE WITH THAT OF </p><p>FORMER FM DINI, WHO WAS, IN MASSARI\'S VIEW, ALSO A SKILLED </p><p>INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMAT BUT, IN CONTRAST TO RUGGIERO, A TEAM </p><p>PLAYER.  FROM A PERSONAL PERSPECTIVE, MASSARI HOPED THAT THE </p><p>NEXT FM WOULD PAY MORE ATTENTION TO ITALY\'S ROLE IN BALKAN </p><p>STABILIZATION, AN AREA ALMOST TOTALLY IGNORED BY RUGGIERO. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>WHO\'S NEXT </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  WHEN ASKED TO SPECULATE ON RUGGIERO\'S SUCCESSOR, </p><p>MASSARI SAID THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO POINT TO ANY ONE </p><p>INDIVIDUAL.  HOWEVER, HE HAD JUST RETURNED FROM A MEETING </p><p>CHAIRED BY THE DIRECTOR GENERAL FOR EUROPEAN AFFAIRS (A/S </p><p>EQUIVALENT) AND OFFICE DIRECTORS, WHERE CONSENSUS SPECULATION </p><p>WAS THAT WHATEVER THE CHOICE, IT WOULD BE MADE MORE ON THE </p><p>BASIS OF POLITICAL LOYALTY THAN FOREIGN POLICY ACUMEN. </p><p>MASSARI ALSO SAID HE WOULD "NOT BE SURPRISED" IF ITALY\'S </p><p>AMBASSADOR TO THE EU (AND FORMER MFA SECRETARY GENERAL) </p><p>UMBERTO VATTANI, WHO "ENJOYS PM BERLUSCONI\'S FULL CONFIDENCE" </p><p>WAS BROUGHT BACK FROM BRUSSELS TO RUN THE </p><p>TECHNICAL/SUBSTANTIVE OPERATIONS OF THE MINISTRY, POSSIBLY AS </p><p>AN UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE OR (AGAIN) AS SECRETARY GENERAL </p><p>OF THE MFA. </p><p> </p><p></p><p>4.  (C)  COMMENT.  WHILE MASSARI\'S VIEW MAY NOT BE SHARED </p><p>ACROSS THE ENTIRE MFA, PARTICULARLY AMONG THOSE BROUGHT IN BY </p><p>RUGGIERO, WE HEARD SIMILAR RUMBLINGS FROM HIGH-LEVEL CONTACTS </p><p>IN THE MINISTRY PRIOR TO RUGGIERO\'S RESIGNATION (REFTEL).  WE </p><p>WILL CONTINUE TO PROBE OUR INTERLOCUTORS FOR THEIR THOUGHTS </p><p>ON RUGGIERO\'S DEPARTURE, AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, ANY CHANGES IN </p><p>THE DIRECTION OF ITALIAN FOREIGN POLICY HIS FIRING MAY </p><p>PORTEND. </p><p> </p><p> 5.  (U) MINIMIZE CONSIDERED. </p><p>POPE </p><p></p><p> 2002ROME00081 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
