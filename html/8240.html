Iraqi oil revenues previously controlled by the UN </p><p>will be transferred to the Iraqi Development Fund, papers </p><p>note.  Foreign Minister Gul hailed the `historic\' decision </p><p>adopted by the UN.  U.S. Ambassador to Ankara, Robert </p><p>Pearson said on TV on Friday that it would be in Turkey\'s </p><p>interest if Ankara pursued an Iraq policy parallel to the </p><p>American one.  Ambassador Pearson stressed that Turkey would </p><p>play a role in the U.S. projects of bringing democracy to </p><p>Iraq, and peace to the Middle East.  Pearson reminded </p><p>viewers that the U.S. has been working with Turkey to </p><p>provide natural gas, food and water in Iraq\'s rebuilding </p><p>process. Ambassador Pearson also noted that Iran and Syria </p><p>should accept the new reality in Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Iraq: U.S. Embassy Ankara has released a statement denying </p><p>the former Prime Minister Ecevit\'s claim last week of a </p><p>`hidden agreement\' between the U.S. and Kurdish nationalists </p><p>living outside Turkey, "Milliyet" reports.  The paper quote </p><p>the press release as saying that the `U.S. has worked </p><p>clearly and openly to ensure the maintenance of the </p><p>territorial integrity of Iraq and will continue to do so,\' </p><p>the statement said.  "Radikal" notices a `slight </p><p>improvement\' in Turkey-U.S. ties as seen in the `first high- </p><p>level visit\' by the Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Lynn </p><p>Pascoe\'s meetings with the MFA and government officials on </p><p>Thursday.  Pascoe has expressed disappointment with Turkey\'s </p><p>reluctance to cooperate with the U.S. in war with Iraq. </p><p>Turkish officials explained it as a by a `democratic reflex\' </p><p>of the regime, Radikal says.  A "Milliyet" op-ed believes </p><p>Turkey\'s interests require good relations with the new Iraq </p><p>and the Iraqi Kurds.  Bearing in mind the Arab region\'s </p><p>enmity of Israel and the Jews, U.S. cannot discard Turkey, </p><p>the commentator thinks.  The column also stresses that some </p><p>`miscalculation\' by Ankara had a damaging effect on Turkey, </p><p>U.S. ties. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EU reforms; IMF:  The latest EU harmonization laws reform </p><p>package  brings some significant changes, papers report: The </p><p>National Security Council (NSC) will not be represented any </p><p>more in a censor\'s board checking the content of films and </p><p>songs.  Article 8 of the Law on the Struggle Against </p><p>Terrorism, which bans propaganda violating the integrity of </p><p>the state, will be scrapped.  The European Court of Human </p><p>Rights (ECHR) decisions will be taken into account as </p><p>grounds for retrials, and the powers of State Security </p><p>Courts (DGMs) will be curtailed.  However, some reforms </p><p>considered earlier by the government are not included in the </p><p>package: Propaganda in Kurdish will not be allowed during </p><p>elections, and NSC will continue to be represented at the </p><p>media watchdog Radio and Television High Council (RTUK), </p><p>reports underline.  Meanwhile, State Minister Babacan said </p><p>that completion of the fifth IMF review might be delayed due </p><p>to the scheduled timetable of the Parliament.  The IMF team </p><p>will leave Turkey on May 31, and IMF\'s Riza Moghadam is </p><p>expected to replace Turkey Desk Chief Juha Kahkonen, papers </p><p>report. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Greek Cypriots visit Turkey after 40 years: A 40-year taboo </p><p>ends and 270 Greek Cypriots on board six buses came through </p><p>the Greek, Turkish border on Thursday to Istanbul after the </p><p>GOT decision to allow Greek Cypriots into Turkey without </p><p>visas, all dailies report.  Papers say Greek Cypriot </p><p>visitors were surprised by the warm reception given to them </p><p>in Turkey.  Meanwhile, Turkish Cypriot leader Denktas said </p><p>that the emerging oil pipelines from the Caucasus to Turkey </p><p>have added to the geo-strategic importance of Cyprus, which, </p><p>he believes, is a trump card in Turkey\'s hands.  Denktas </p><p>claimed the UN plan for Cyprus was designed to provide </p><p>legitimacy to the Greek Cypriots\' EU accession, and that he </p><p>would never sign it. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION:  Genocide resolution on the Congressional </p><p>agenda </p><p>"A litmus test at the Congress for Turkish-American </p><p>Friendship" </p><p>Fatih Altayli warns against the Judiciary Committee-approved </p><p>resolution in mass appeal Hurriyet (5/23): "The US House of </p><p>Representatives is being manipulated by the Armenian lobby. </p><p>The recent draft resolution, which was sent to the floor, is </p><p>skillfully crafted to disguise the real goal: to have the US </p><p>Congress approve the Armenian genocide claims. .  Turkish- </p><p>American relations have gone through a similar case during </p><p>the Clinton era.  It was the time of much better relations </p><p>between the two countries, and Clinton intervened at the </p><p>last minute to prevent a similar resolution from adopted by </p><p>the Congress.  It remains to be seen whether President Bush </p><p>is going to take the same move this time.  It is also </p><p>possible President Bush might use the same argument, just </p><p>like the Turkish leaders Gul and Erdogan did during the </p><p>parliamentary rejection of the motion on the Iraq war, i.e. </p><p>"such things happen in a functioning democracy".  . Thus the </p><p>whole issue will be like a litmus test vis--vis the Turkish- </p><p>American relationship and its future prospects." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Turkey needs the Pentagon\'s support" </p><p>Zeynep Gurcanli wrote in tabloid Star (5/23): "The draft at </p><p>the Congressional agenda has a reference to the genocide </p><p>against Jews, therefore the Jewish lobby did not take any </p><p>action in support of Turkey.  State Department tried to </p><p>block the draft or at least to omit the expression `Armenian </p><p>genocide\' yet failed.  In the past, a similar draft was </p><p>prevented from receiving Congressional approval following </p><p>the Pentagon\'s intervention.  At that time, the Pentagon </p><p>listed the facts about military sales to Turkey and used </p><p>this argument before the congressmen by underlying that the </p><p>US should avoid moves that could harm its loyal ally. . </p><p>However, the basis for this argument has collapsed when the </p><p>motion allowing US troops in Turkey was rejected by the </p><p>Turkish Parliament. The hawks in the Pentagon were deeply </p><p>disappointed with the attitude of Turkey.  For this reason, </p><p>Turkey will now be deprived of Pentagon support in a very </p><p>critical time.  And the fact of the matter is that for </p><p>Turkey there will be very hard times ahead if they must deal </p><p>with mojor issues in the absence of Pentagon\'s support." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
