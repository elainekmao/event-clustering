O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, EAGR, ECON, ZI, Land Reform </p><p>SUBJECT: Black Farmer\'s Take on Land Reform </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but unclassified. </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Summary:  A large-scale black commercial farmer </p><p>believes most settlers on expropriated white commercial </p><p>farms will fail and give up during 2003, leaving a future </p><p>government to pick up the pieces of uncompensated land </p><p>redistribution.  At the same time, he expressed regret </p><p>that white farmers did little to assist nascent black </p><p>commercial farmers in the years before the GOZ began its </p><p>controversial fast-track land reform.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Wilson Nyabonda has emerged as one of Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>most successful black commercial farmers.  We recently </p><p>toured his vast tobacco, soybean, paprika and maize crops </p><p>while exchanging views on Zimbabwean agriculture. </p><p>Nyabonda believes Zimbabwe\'s so-called new farmers -- </p><p>those resettled on seized white farms -- have little </p><p>prospect of success.  They and the GOZ overrated the </p><p>value of land in farming, which Nyabonda calculates at 10 </p><p>percent among other inputs.  He sees no evidence new </p><p>farmers are willing or able to invest the remaining 90 </p><p>percent in seed, fertilizer, equipment, transport or </p><p>workers.  He is troubled by their lack of emotional </p><p>commitment, evinced by the obsession among the </p><p>politically-connected to take over the family houses of </p><p>white farmers, then worry about crops later.  Ethical </p><p>considerations aside, Nyabonda feels a well-anointed </p><p>house should be the "last" concern of a devoted farmer, </p><p>and he himself is only building an upscale house after 8 </p><p>years on his property.  He also worries that his farm </p><p>cannot comfortably coexist alongside many smaller new </p><p>farms in an area where commercial farmers have always </p><p>benefited from economies of scale. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) At the same time, Nyabonda recounted his </p><p>frustration that the Commercial Farmers Union (CFU) did </p><p>not provide support for him and other emerging black </p><p>commercial farmers in the early-1990s.  By 1995, most of </p><p>them broke ranks and formed the Indigenous Commercial </p><p>Farmers Union (ICFU), an association that is still </p><p>thriving today.  The CFU lived on as a white-farmer </p><p>lobby, limiting its influence with the race-conscious </p><p>GOZ. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>4. (SBU) Few Zimbabweans have much good to say about the </p><p>GOZ\'s version of land reform, which has turned the </p><p>breadbasket of Southern Africa into a beggar nation. </p><p>However, white farmers -- regarded simultaneously as </p><p>enterprising overachievers and vestiges of race-based </p><p>privilege -- still provoke polarized sentiments.  The </p><p>truth is more nuanced.  White farmers here ran the most </p><p>productive agro-businesses anywhere, making Zimbabwe tops </p><p>in world tobacco exports and inspiring black </p><p>entrepreneurs like Nyabonda to follow in their footsteps. </p><p>But along the way, they did not appreciate the need to </p><p>embrace black commercial farmers -- equally business- </p><p>savvy but with fewer advantages -- or the ticking time- </p><p>bomb they epitomized and that President Mugabe finally </p><p>exploded in the path of political opposition. </p><p>Ironically, neither white nor recently resettled farmers, </p><p>everyone\'s present focus, will mean much in Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>agricultural future.  The country will come to depend on </p><p>the generation of black commercial farmers that acquired </p><p>land in a more conventional way. </p><p> </p><p>Sullivan </p><p></p></div>
