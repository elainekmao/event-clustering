<p>UNCLAS COLOMBO 000629 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR INR/R/MR, I/RW, I/REC; PA </p><p>SA/INS (FOR JWALLER); SA/PD (LJIRWIN, LSCENSNY, </p><p>WREINCKENS); SSA/PAB </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, OPRC, KMDR, OIIP, CE, External Relations </p><p>SUBJECT:  MEDIA PLAY:  IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>1. Sri Lankan front-page readers woke up to headlines </p><p>describing the Iraqi regime\'s collapse and to photographs </p><p>of coalition forces and Iraqi civilians enjoying each </p><p>other\'s company.  English front pages ran headlines such as </p><p>"Saddam\'s rule collapses in chaos," "Saddam\'s rule </p><p>crumbles," and "U.S. forces welcomed in Baghdad."  The </p><p>vernacular dailies mostly followed suit with "Saddam regime </p><p>likely to collapse," "Iraqi people warmly greets American </p><p>forces," and "No news of Saddam."  The stories were </p><p>accompanied by pix of an "Iraqi civilian embracing an </p><p>American soldier," "Iraqi man put flowers on the head of a </p><p>U.S. marine," "Iraqis loot the house of a Baath party </p><p>official," and, of course, the ubiquitous pix of the Saddam </p><p>statue wrenched from its pedestal in Baghdad."  Only one of </p><p>Sri Lanka\'s dozen dailies told a different story:  DIVAINA </p><p>(an opposition Sinhala daily) reported "Horrible street </p><p>fights between two forces even yesterday," while running a </p><p>pix of three U.S. helicopters surveilling a palatial </p><p>building in Baghdad. </p><p> </p><p>2. Although editorials continued to focus on other issues, </p><p>an independent Sinhala daily, LAKBIMA, did comment on the </p><p>"racket of rebuilding war torn Iraq."  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>"The U.S.\'s attitude toward the UN Security Council is no </p><p>secret.  America won\'t work very hard to get Security </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Council approval for a scheme to reconstruct Iraq.... </p><p> </p><p>"Is a retired American General going to take over in </p><p>Saddam-less Iraq?  They say that he will be entrusted with </p><p>the oil and responsible for humanitarian aid....  Many </p><p>diplomats are skeptical ... and Arabs don\'t like it either. </p><p>However, America has already appointed him...." </p><p> </p><p>Wills </p><p></p></div>
