<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 RIYADH 002696 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR TUELLER; PARIS FOR ALLEGRONE </p><p> </p><p>E.O.12958: DECL:  07/11/06 </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, PREL, SA </p><p>SUBJECT:  THE SAUDI KING: FIT TO REIGN, NOT TO RULE </p><p> </p><p>REF:  RIYADH 2349 AND PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  CLASSIFIED BY CHARGE D\'AFFAIRES THEODORE </p><p>KATTOUF: 1.5 B, D. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  SUMMARY:  THE KING\'S RECENT MEDICAL AND </p><p>POLITICAL COMEBACK, EVIDENCED IN HIS SUSTAINED CHAIRING </p><p>OF THE WEEKLY COUNCIL OF MINISTERS SESSIONS AND HIS </p><p>SUBSTANTIVE ENGAGEMENTS WITH HIGH-LEVEL VISITORS, IS </p><p>PROOF OF FAHD\'S CAPACITY TO REIGN.  WHILE FRENCH AND </p><p>BRITISH VISITORS LEFT THEIR MEETINGS WITH THE KING </p><p>SURPRISED BY THE EXTENT OF HIS RECOVERY, THEY POINT TO </p><p>FAHD\'S REDUCED STAMINA, IMPAIRED MENTAL AGILITY, AND </p><p>IMMOBILITY AS NATURAL LIMITS ON HIS ABILITY TO RULE IN A </p><p>DAY-TO-DAY CAPACITY.  THE KING\'S IMPROVED HEALTH </p><p>OBVIATES ANY RETURN TO AN ABDULLAH REGENCY, BUT WILL NOT </p><p>REVERSE THE GRADUAL ACCRETION OF AUTHORITY BY THE CROWN </p><p>PRINCE AND MINDEF SULTAN.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>THE COMEBACK KING </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  DEFYING THE PREDICTIONS OF SOME WITHIN HIS </p><p>MEDICAL ENTOURAGE, THE KING IS ENJOYING A MEDICAL AND </p><p>POLITICAL COMEBACK.  DATING FROM HIS JUNE 8 RECEPTION OF </p><p>OMAN\'S SULTAN QABOOS, FAHD\'S PUBLIC APPEARANCES HAVE </p><p>GROWN IN NUMBER AND IN CONSEQUENCE.  MORE OFTEN THAN </p><p>NOT, FAHD IS CHAIRING THE WEEKLY COUNCIL OF MINISTERS </p><p>MEETING AND HIS RECEPTION OF FOREIGN V.I.P.\'S HAS </p><p>EVOLVED FROM PERFUNCTORY "DROP-BY\'S" TO ENGAGEMENTS OF </p><p>POLITICAL SIGNIFICANCE.  THE KING\'S LEVEL OF ACTIVITY </p><p>SUGGESTS THAT THERE WILL BE NO IMMINENT RESUMPTION OF </p><p>THE CROWN PRINCE\'S REGENCY.  HOWEVER, RECENT WESTERN </p><p>VISITORS HAVE DRAWN SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT CONCLUSIONS ABOUT </p><p>THE KING\'S MENTAL AND PHYSICAL CAPABILITIES. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>RIFKIND ON FAHD: ONE TRACK MIND </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  THE BRITISH READ-OUT ON FAHD\'S HEALTH, </p><p>FOLLOWING FOREIGN MINISTER RIFKIND\'S JULY 1 MEETING WITH </p><p>THE KING (REFTEL), CLOSELY PARALLELS OUR ASSESSMENT OF </p><p>FAHD DURING SECDEF PERRY\'S JUNE 29 VISIT.  CAPABLE OF </p><p>GOING BEYOND PROTOCOL AND OF HANDLING A FOCUSED </p><p>SUBSTANTIVE EXCHANGE, FAHD IS NEVERTHELESS NOTICEABLY </p><p>MORE FREQUENTLY REPETITIVE AND "LESS SHARP."  U.K. </p><p>AMBASSADOR ANDREW GREEN RELATED TO CHARGE THAT, IN </p><p>RESPONSE TO A QUESTION POSED BY RIFKIND, FAHD WAS UNABLE </p><p>TO SHIFT GEARS AND ADDRESS A TOPIC UNRELATED TO HIS </p><p>PRIMARY AGENDA.  IN THE AWKWARD PAUSE WHICH ENSUED, THE </p><p>DELEGATION WAS QUICKLY SUMMONED TO A DINNER HOSTED BY </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER SAUD AL-FAYSAL.  THE KING APPEARED TO </p><p>THE BRITISH OBSERVERS TO BE IN REASONABLY GOOD PHYSICAL </p><p>CONDITION, ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>FRENCH TAKE: MENTALLY ENGAGED, PHYSICALLY DIMINISHED </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  ACCORDING TO FRENCH EMBASSY COUNSELOR PAUL </p><p>ORTHOLAN, CHIRAC AND HIS DELEGATION WERE SURPRISED BY </p><p>THE KING\'S LEVEL OF PARTICIPATION THROUGHOUT THE JULY </p><p>6-8 VISIT.  FAHD WAS PRESENT AT THE AIRPORT, STANDING ON </p><p>THE TARMAC IN THE STIFLING JEDDAH HEAT AS CHIRAC\'S PLANE </p><p>LANDED.  WHILE THE ARRIVAL CEREMONY WAS TRUNCATED (E.G., </p><p>NO NATIONAL ANTHEMS) IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE KING\'S TIME </p><p>ON HIS FEET AND HIS EXPOSURE TO THE HEAT, FAHD DROVE </p><p>WITH CHIRAC TO THE GUEST PALACE AND LATER IN THE EVENING </p><p>HOSTED A DINNER, FOLLOWED BY A 90 MINUTE BILATERAL WHICH </p><p>INCLUDED A 15 MINUTE TETE-A-TETE BETWEEN FAHD AND THE </p><p>FRENCH PRESIDENT.  AT THE CONCLUSION OF CHIRAC\'S VISIT, </p><p>FAHD DROVE WITH CHIRAC TO THE AIRPORT AND SAW HIM OFF. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  WHILE THE KING REPEATED HIMSELF FREQUENTLY IN </p><p>HIS DINNER AND BILATERAL DISCUSSIONS, CHIRAC AND HIS </p><p>PARTY VIEWED THIS MORE AS AN ARAB MANNERISM, THAN A </p><p>MANIFESTATION OF HIS NOVEMBER 1995 STROKE.  ORTHALON </p><p>NOTED THAT THE EXCHANGES FOCUSED ON THE PEACE PROCESS, </p><p>WITH LONG KINGLY DIGRESSIONS INTO PRIOR SAG INITIATIVES </p><p>TO PROMOTE PEACE IN THE REGION, BUT THAT WITHIN THIS </p><p>CONVERSATIONAL ORBIT, FAHD WAS FULLY ABREAST OF THE </p><p>CAIRO SUMMIT, THE G-7 LYON STATEMENT, AND THE EU </p><p>FLORENCE COMMUNIQUE.  ON THE WHOLE, ORTHALON REPORTED, </p><p>KING FAHD APPEARED IN BETTER MENTAL SHAPE THAN THEY HAD </p><p>BEEN LED TO BELIEVE. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  HOWEVER, ORTHALON EMPHASIZED, CHIRAC WAS STRUCK </p><p>BY THE KING\'S PHYSICAL DETERIORATION.  (NOTE: CHIRAC IS </p><p>THE FIRST WESTERN OBSERVER TO HAVE VIEWED THE KING IN </p><p>ACTION OVER A SUSTAINED PERIOD OF TIME.  TYPICALLY THE </p><p>KING HAS GREETED VISITORS STANDING IN A RECEPTION HALL, </p><p>BUT HAS NOT BEEN SEEN OR TELEVISED WALKING.)  FAHD </p><p>APPEARED TO BE ALMOST CRIPPLED, ORTHALON REPORTED, AND </p><p>WALKED WITH "TREMENDOUS" DIFFICULTY, HUNCHED OVER, USING </p><p>A CANE, AND SUPPORTED ON EITHER SIDE BY AN AIDE.  AT THE </p><p>END OF THE DINNER, FAHD REQUIRED ASSISTANCE IN STANDING </p><p>UP.  FOLLOWING THE 90 MINUTE BILATERAL, THE KING WAS </p><p>UNABLE TO RISE AND CHIRAC LENT A HAND IN ASSISTING FAHD </p><p>TO A WHEELCHAIR.  THE FRENCH DELEGATION DID NOT KNOW </p><p>WHAT TO MAKE OF FAHD\'S DARK SUNGLASSES, WHICH HE WORE </p><p>THROUGHOUT THE DINNER AND SUBSEQUENT MEETING. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>COMMENT: A REIGNING MONARCH </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  FAHD\'S APPARENT RECOVERY IS SUFFICIENT TO QUELL </p><p>DOUBTS AS TO HIS ABILITY TO REIGN.  HIS CAPACITY TO </p><p>RULE, HOWEVER, APPEARS TRUNCATED.  REDUCED STAMINA, </p><p>IMPAIRED MENTAL AGILITY, AND IMMOBILITY WILL DELIMIT </p><p>FAHD\'S INVOLVEMENT IN THE DAY-TO-DAY AFFAIRS OF STATE. </p><p>THUS, WHILE THE KING APPEARS TO HAVE RECOVERED </p><p>SUBSTANTIALLY FROM HIS STROKE LAST NOVEMBER, IT IS ALSO </p><p>CLEARQ, HE QIKELY TO COMPLETELY REGAIN HIS </p><p>EARLIER FORM EITHER MENTALLY OR PHYSICALLY. </p><p>CONSEQUENTLY, WE ANTICIPATE THAT THE CROWN PRINCE AND </p><p>MINDEF SULTAN WILL CONTINUE TO FILL THE WIDE GAPS LEFT </p><p>BY THE KING\'S REDUCED ABILITY TO MANAGE SAUDI DECISION- </p><p>MAKING. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>KATTOUF </p><p></p></div>
