DR. LANG AGREED THAT THIS HAD BEEN THE </p><p>SIMPLE AND RUTHLESSLY EFFECTIVE PLAN OF THE SERBS FROM </p><p>THE OUTSET, THOUGH LATER IMITATED BY OTHER SIDES.  "AT </p><p>THE END OF THIS CENTURY IT HAS BEEN SHOWN THAT GENOCIDE </p><p>IS REALLY THE MOST PROFITABLE FORM OF AGGRESSION," LANG </p><p>ADDED. </p><p> </p><p>8.  MR.

TO MAKE THE POINT, HE OBSERVED THAT EVEN IN THE </p><p>BARBAROUS STRUGGLE BETWEEN USTASHA, CHETNIK AND </p><p>PARTISAN FORCES IN WORLD WAR II, MASS RAPE HAD NOT </p><p>FIGURED PROMINENTLY AMONG THE MANY ATROCITIES </p><p>COMMITTED.

PROFESSOR ROKSANDIC SPOKE AT LENGTH ON THE ROLE OF </p><p>THE MEDIA AS A WEAPON OF WAR AND THE SIGNAL INSTIGATION </p><p>TO THIS ETHNIC CONFLICT.  THE USE OF MASS MEDIA AT THE </p><p>OUTSET AND THROUGHOUT THE WARS IN CROATIA AND BOSNIA- </p><p>HERZEGOVINA TO FAN ETHNIC SUSPICIONS AND ANXIETIES INTO </p><p>ACTS OF VIOLENCE IS, IN ITSELF, A WAR CRIME, ROKANDIC </p><p>ARGUED.  A/S SHATTUCK TOOK THE POINT FURTHER, ASKING IF </p><p>ROKANDIC WAS SUGGESTING A DELIBERATE EXPLOITATION OF </p><p>MEDIA BY SERB LEADER MILOSEVIC IN PARTICULAR, AND THAT </p><p>SUCH TACTICS SHOULD COME WITHIN THE AUTHORITY OF THE </p><p>WAR CRIMES TRIBUNAL.  ROKSANDIC SAID THAT IT SHOULD BE </p><p>INVESTIGATED. </p><p> </p><p>10.  LANG AGREED AND EXPANDED ON THIS THEME. </p><p>ASSESSMENTS THAT THE CONFLICT IN FORMER YUGOSLAVIA WAS </p><p>AN INEVITABILITY OWING TO CERTAIN TRAITS AMONG "THE </p><p>BALKAN PRIMITIVES" ARE "RACIST AND DECEPTIVE, " LANG </p><p>SAID.  THIS IDEA -- CIRCULATED WIDELY IN WESTERN MEDIA </p><p>AND AMONG POLICY ANALYSTS -- CONTRIBUTED TO </p><p>INTERNATIONAL INACTION IN THE CRISIS AND HENCE WAS </p><p>POSSIBLY FUELED BY SERB PROPAGANDA EFFORTS. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>WHAT IS TO BE DONE? </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  THE GROUP AGREED THAT ONGOING EFFORTS TO INTERRUPT </p><p>HUMANITARIAN AID CONVOYS IN THE REGION CONSTITUTED A </p><p>WAR CRIME AGAINST CIVILIAN POPULATIONS AND THAT THIS </p><p>WAS ONE AREA IN WHICH ACTION COULD STILL BE TAKEN TO </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00176  03 OF 04  131753Z </p><p>SAVE LIVES, NOT JUST EXACT RETRIBUTION AFTER THE FACT. </p><p> </p><p>12.  THEY ALSO AGREED THAT OTHER HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>VIOLATIONS CONTINUE UNABATED AND MUST BE STOPPED, BUT </p><p>LANG OBSERVED THAT HUMAN RIGHTS DISCUSSIONS IN THE </p><p>BALKANS NOW OFTEN BECOME BOGGED DOWN IN ARGUMENTS ABOUT </p><p>"WHO IS MORE VICTIMIZED," WHICH OBSCURE PRIORITIES AND </p><p>STUNT EFFECTIVE ACTION. </p><p> </p><p>13.  A/S SHATTUCK AND AMBASSADOR GALBRAITH ASKED THE </p><p>GROUP TO COMMENT ON U.S. INSISTE </p><p>NCE THAT MINORITY </p><p>RIGHTS ARE KEY TO ANY PEACE PROCESS, AND MUST BE </p><p>OBSERVED BOTH IN LAW AND IN FACT.  ROKSANDIC AGREED BUT </p><p>SAID "THAT DISCUSSION HAS NOT YET TAKEN PLACE" IN </p><p>CROATIA BETWEEN CROATS AND THE ELEMENTS OF THE SERB </p><p>MINORITY WHICH DESIRE PEACEFUL COEXISTENCE.
