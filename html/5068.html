<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 000237 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/09/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDAN FIRST CAMPAIGN PRESSES AHEAD: </p><p>RECOMMENDATIONS INCLUDE QUOTAS FOR WOMEN PARLIAMENTARIANS </p><p> </p><p>REF: AMMAN 6522 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: CDA GREGORY L. BERRY FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) The "Jordan First" campaign continues to make </p><p>headlines almost daily as the GOJ moves to implement </p><p>recommendations put forward in December by the Jordan First </p><p>Committee--consisting of 31 political and business leaders. </p><p>While some of the initiatives are straightforward, </p><p>others--particularly the introduction of quotas for women in </p><p>Parliament--have proven to be controversial.  The Islamic </p><p>Action Front (IAF) and Opposition Parties--those who have </p><p>been able to capitalize most on popular pan-Arab issues--have </p><p>not surprisingly voiced their opposition to the "Jordan </p><p>First" campaign. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>RECOMMENDATIONS INCLUDE SPRING ELECTIONS: KING AGREES </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  The "Jordan First" committee presented its findings </p><p>and recommendations to King Abdullah on December 18 and the </p><p>GOJ has moved apace to implement the findings.  Prime </p><p>Minister Abul Ragheb on January 8 announced the formation of </p><p>five new committees that will be charged with implementing </p><p>the recommendations of the original committee: the </p><p>Constitutional Court Committee, the Political Parties </p><p>Committee, the Women\'s Parliamentary Quota Committee, the </p><p>Anti-Corruption Committee, and the Professional Associations </p><p>and Civil Society Institutions Committee. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  The committee\'s specific recommendations included: </p><p>quotas for women in parliament, the creation of a </p><p>constitutional court, school curricula reform, and amending </p><p>the political parties law to strengthen the political party </p><p>system.  The committee also recommended that elections be </p><p>held this spring, and idea the King subsequently reaffirmed. </p><p>The focus of the five newly-formed committees suggest that </p><p>the government\'s attention will mostly be on political and </p><p>judicial reform. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>QUOTAS FOR WOMEN ALSO INCLUDED </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) The most controversial of the recommendations--and one </p><p>the King seemed committed to--is the adoption of temporary </p><p>quotas for women in parliament.  The quota issue has been </p><p>controversial even among politically-active women who would </p><p>most benefit.  In discussions with several women who had </p><p>recently returned from the US after participating in the IV </p><p>program "Women as Political Leaders: US Elections and </p><p>Political Campaigns", Poloff found that two of the five </p><p>voiced opposition to the quotas.  One argued that the </p><p>IAF--who she opined did not represent the interests of </p><p>women--would be able to capitalize on the quotas because of </p><p>their effective campaign machinery and might win a majority </p><p>of the women-quota seats with their own female candidates. </p><p>Those women who approved of the quota emphasized that it </p><p>would be a temporary measure, to allow women a toehold in the </p><p>lower (i.e. elected) house of Parliament.  Some also suggest </p><p>that representation for women would help moderate the IAF, as </p><p>well as Jordanian political life as a whole.  Both proponents </p><p>and opponents of a quota system stress that training for </p><p>women in Parliament will be vital, since the professionalism </p><p>that they show will help determine opportunities for women </p><p>candidates in the future. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) The GOJ has yet to define how the quotas will be </p><p>enforced, but there is almost a universal assumption that </p><p>there will be a mechanism in place by the Spring elections. </p><p>The issue of women quotas is likely to be particularly </p><p>controversial among the more traditional tribal elements. </p><p>Poloff talked to conservative East Banker Mahmoud Kharabsheh, </p><p>who, as a "Jordan First" committee member, was the lone vote </p><p>against establishing quotas.  Kharabsheh argued that the </p><p>quotas for women were illegal from a constitutional </p><p>perspective (though there are already quotas in place for </p><p>some minorities, such as Circassians), and that the current </p><p>law already allowed for women to be elected (though under the </p><p>current electoral law, only one woman has ever been popularly </p><p>elected). </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>IAF AND OPPOSITION NOT SOLD </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) The IAF has publicly criticized the campaign.  An </p><p>article in As-Sabeel, the IAF mouthpiece, accused the "Jordan </p><p>First" campaign of contradicting the sections of the </p><p>constitution that stipulate the religion of the state as </p><p>Islam and that Jordan is a part of the Arab nation.  The IAF </p><p>also claimed that the campaign was designed to restrict the </p><p>Islamic movement and political parties, and to undermine the </p><p>(political) role of professional unions. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) The IAF generates much of its popular support by </p><p>embracing popular pan-Arab issues.  They have been able to </p><p>capitalize on "anti-normalization" issues and will most </p><p>likely be some of the loudest voices of dissent should there </p><p>be any military action against Iraq.  There is no incentive </p><p>for the IAF to shift the debate to internal issues in Jordan </p><p>while regional issues have the ire and attention of most of </p><p>their constituency. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) The Opposition Parties Higher Coordination </p><p>Committee--made up of 13 parties (including the IAF) with </p><p>disparate agendas--declined a GOJ-invitation to participate </p><p>on the committee that will oversee political parties.  The </p><p>spokesperson for the opposition parties publicly argued that </p><p>political reform should wait until after parliamentary </p><p>elections, when new laws would not be relegated to temporary </p><p>law status. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) The GOJ has begun to push back against the criticism. </p><p> Minister of State for Political Affairs and Minister of </p><p>Information Mohammad Adwan voiced his criticism of the </p><p>opposition parties\' stance in the Jordan Times on January 9: </p><p>"They prefer to stay on the sidelines of the scene </p><p>specializing in criticizing without helping the different </p><p>segments of society and participating in the constructive </p><p>building of a strong Jordan."  A Jordan Times editorial the </p><p>same day opined that the opposition parties\' decision not to </p><p>participate was, "at the least disappointing, if not utterly </p><p>irresponsible." </p><p> </p><p>------ </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) The GOJ is pursuing the "Jordan First" campaign with </p><p>increasing vigor as the expected US conflict with Iraq draws </p><p>nearer and the Israeli-Palestinian crisis deepens.  There is </p><p>still some skepticism in Jordanian society that "Jordan </p><p>First" is merely an amalgam of empty slogans that will effect </p><p>little change.  Whether it will achieve its goal of forging a </p><p>national identity and re-focusing the populace on internal </p><p>issues is unclear, but it has been the impetus for a </p><p>commitment to Spring elections and could bring some welcome </p><p>reforms in the political and judicial sectors. </p><p>BERRY </p><p></p></div>
