<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L HARARE 000780 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/23/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, ZI, SF, MI </p><p>SUBJECT: MULUZI/MBEKI VISIT POSTPONEMENT </p><p> </p><p>REF: LILONGWE 406 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: JOSEPH G. SULLIVAN FOR REASONS 1.5 B/D </p><p> </p><p> 1.(c) Stephen Nkomo, Governor of Matabeleland South and </p><p>brother of the late Joshua Nkomo,  passed away last weekend, </p><p>was declared a national hero by the ZANU/PF Politburo, and </p><p>will be buried at heroes\' acre on Friday April 25. </p><p>Typically, President Mugabe would speak at the occasion and </p><p>might visit the Nkomo family prior to the event.  Such a </p><p>death does not typically mean the cancellation of all other </p><p>activities.  Indeed, Angolan Foreign Minister Joao Miranda </p><p>arrived April 22 at the invitation of Foreign Minister </p><p>Mudenge and has a very full program April 23, reportedly to </p><p>discuss the SADC task force meeting scheduled for early May. </p><p>The ZCTU work stayaway also began fairly successfully today </p><p>April 23 and is scheduled to run through, at least, April 25. </p><p> </p><p>2.(c) Comment:  While the GOZ has a plausible excuse for </p><p>postponing the Muluzi/Mbeki visit, we would not be surprised </p><p>if the GOZ was anxious to avoid the pressure they feared </p><p>might be coming their way. Certainly, the GOZ has been using </p><p>delay and obfuscation with respect to the SADC Organ of </p><p>Consultation and the SADC Task Force visits. Even, Mudenge\'s </p><p>invitation to Miranda "to prepare the SADC Task Force visit" </p><p>appears an attempt to gain control of the agenda of the task </p><p>force visit in contradiction to prior efforts of SADC </p><p>Ambassadors here to plan a balanced program.  We would also </p><p>not be surprised to see the Zimbabweans seek to sow seeds of </p><p>discord between the Angolan SADC Presidency and Presidents </p><p>Muluzi and Mbeki. </p><p> </p><p>3.(c) Comment continued:  President Mugabe\'s professed </p><p>readiness, in a friendly televised interview, to meet MDC </p><p>leader Tsvangirai was conditioned very carefully on </p><p>Tsvangirai\'s willingness to accept Mugabe as President. </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Mugabe also hinted vaguely in that interview at his possible </p><p>willingness to consider retirement, but we read these </p><p>comments as designed to diminish pressure on his regime. </p><p>Nonetheless, we believe that the Muluzi/Mbeki initiative is </p><p>the best current hope for changing the equation and hope that </p><p>these leaders will stick to their intentions and press hard </p><p>when they come. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
