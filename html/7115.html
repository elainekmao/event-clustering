<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 LAGOS 000713 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EAID, EPET, EINV, EFIN, PGOV, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA\'S NIGER DELTA DEVELOPMENT COMMISSION: MIXED </p><p>REVIEW </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary:  The Niger Delta Development Corporation (NDDC) </p><p>was established in 2001 to ensure sustainable development of </p><p>Nigeria\'s troubled oil-producing region. Events of the last </p><p>month in the Delta region suggest that the NDDC has failed </p><p>to meet the test. Since 2001, the NDDC has received about </p><p>$323 million for operations, yet the inhabitants of the </p><p>region have perceived little change in living standards. </p><p>NDDC officials believe the Corporation can improve their </p><p>situation through coordination of activities of donor </p><p>agencies in the area.  The NDDC has commissioned the design </p><p>of an $8.5 million master plan for this purpose. However, </p><p>development will only be sustainable to the extent that it </p><p>supports an enabling environment for the oil and gas </p><p>producers in the region.  The NDDC\'s propensity to implement </p><p>projects raising its profile, the legacy it inherited of </p><p>failed projects, its financial opaqueness, and the </p><p>observations of skeptics suggest that the NDDC will have </p><p>difficulty establishing itself as an effective institution </p><p>of social stability and economic development. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>NDDC\'s Mandate </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  On February 18 NDDC Managing Director Godwin Omene </p><p>briefed EconOff on the NDDC, the challenges it faces, and on </p><p>a master plan in progress. NDDC\'s predecessor, the Oil </p><p>Mineral Producing Areas Development Commission (OMPADEC), </p><p>had been established in 1992 to administer three percent of </p><p>Nigeria\'s total crude oil revenue for the benefit of the </p><p>Niger Delta\'s population.  OMPADEC failed due to poor and </p><p>irregular funding, instability of its board of directors, </p><p>and lack of political will to complete projects, according </p><p>to Omene. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  The NDDC took up OMPADEC\'s discredited mandate on August </p><p>21, 2001.  Its brief was broad, as the NDDC aims to </p><p>formulate policies for the sustainable development of a </p><p>region comprising Nigeria\'s nine oil-producing states: Abia, </p><p>Rivers, Akwa Ibom, Imo, Delta, Bayelsa, Edo, Ondo, and Cross </p><p>River.  This landmass covers 70,000 square kilometers and </p><p>comprises seven forms of terrain (dry land, seasonal flooded </p><p>land, swamps, shallow inland waters, near offshore land, and </p><p>the deep offshore seabed). The region\'s bio-diversity is on </p><p>par with that of Mississippi, and its population </p><p>approximates 20 million. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. Although the Niger Delta accounts for about 90 percent of </p><p>Nigeria\'s export earnings from oil production and 70 percent </p><p>of the revenue accruing to the Federation Account, the per </p><p>capita income of the Delta\'s inhabitants is below the </p><p>national average of $280.  The Delta thus remains one of </p><p>Nigeria\'s least developed regions.  The continued </p><p>restiveness in the region is partly attributable to this </p><p>fact. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>NDDC Funding </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. Nigeria\'s constitution provides that at least 13 percent </p><p>of the oil revenues of the Federation Account must be </p><p>allocated to the oil producing states on the basis of a </p><p>derivation principle.  With the concurrence of these states, </p><p>the Federal Government theoretically allocates 15 percent of </p><p>this funding to the NDDC.  Oil and gas producing companies </p><p>in the Niger Delta contribute 3 percent of their annual </p><p>operating budget to the Commission.  The Commission should </p><p>arguably receive 50 percent of all monies due to member </p><p>states from the Federal Government\'s Ecological Fund.  The </p><p>NDDC is also entitled to any monies given to it in the form </p><p>of loans or grants.  The NDDC may keep any proceeds from its </p><p>other assets as well. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. Omene stated that in fact the NDDC receives only 10 </p><p>percent of its agreed allocation of the funds earmarked for </p><p>the states from the Federation Account.  The oil companies </p><p>pay their 3 percent contribution, minus monies earmarked for </p><p>gas flaring expenditures.  While Omene commends the oil </p><p>companies for their contribution, he is pushing for more </p><p>funds. Omene said the NDDC would need three to four times </p><p>the funds it receives annually to implement its planned </p><p>projects. (The March 26 issue of Nigeria\'s "The Guardian" </p><p>newspaper reported that NDDC has received about 42 billion </p><p>naira ($323 million) for operations since 2001.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  As alluded to above, there is debate about which </p><p>institution should receive Ecology Fund monies. The NDDC had </p><p>thought that it was to receive 50 percent of the ecology </p><p>funds, but Omene said the oil-producing states will get the </p><p>funds directly.  He hopes that an amendment to the Act will </p><p>change this since the NDDC wants to use these funds to drain </p><p>plots, rehabilitate fish ponds and fresh water pools, </p><p>restore coastal environs and lost villages, and recover </p><p>spillage sites.  The environmental damage to be rectified, </p><p>he said was, and continues to be, cased by flaring of </p><p>natural gas in Nigeria, which at 50 percent of gas output is </p><p>the highest worldwide. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>Master Plan </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. Omene said the NDDC faces the challenge of designing a </p><p>feasible yet visionary master plan. The act that established </p><p>the NDDC calls for the corporation to implement policies </p><p>that bear on health, education, employment, </p><p>industrialization, agriculture and fisheries, housing and </p><p>urban development, water supply and electric power, and </p><p>transportation and telecommunications. The NDDC plans to </p><p>implement its mandate through its 11 directorates. </p><p>Collectively, they will try to coordinate the programs of </p><p>all the international and domestic development agencies in </p><p>the Niger Delta. Omene said NDDC consultants will encourage </p><p>local community groups to express their needs, input that </p><p>will become an integral component of the master plan. </p><p>9. The NDDC has appointed two consulting firms to draft this </p><p>plan.  German Technical Cooperation International Services, </p><p>an arm of the German international aid agency, Gesellschaft </p><p>fr Technische Zusammenarbeit or GTZ, is working with a </p><p>Nigerian company, WILBAHI, on the project. The NDDC has set </p><p>an October 2003 deadline for completing the design of the </p><p>master plan at a cost of $8.5 million. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>Achievements </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. Although the NDDC\'s consultants advised it to await </p><p>completion of the master plan before implementing projects, </p><p>the NDDC has initiated several to show that it is active. </p><p>Omene said the NDDC has completed 211 projects including </p><p>primary schools, river canals, rural electrification, and </p><p>road construction since 2001. Another 700 projects are </p><p>ongoing. The Niger Delta communities have high expectations </p><p>of the NDDC, Omene said, since it has completed some of its </p><p>predecessor\'s 1,506 abandoned projects. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. According to Omene, the NDDC has placed stringent </p><p>requirements on its contractors, given its predecessor\'s </p><p>history of waste and corruption. Those who change </p><p>specifications or otherwise do not perform are discharged, </p><p>not paid, or fined. Payments are made according to project </p><p>completion stage. Large advances are not given: contractors </p><p>receive 25 percent of the value of contracts at the </p><p>commencement of projects. Banks must certify payments </p><p>according to work completed.  The NDDC has 24 project </p><p>monitors. Non-governmental organizations (NGOs), community </p><p>groups, donors, state and local governments, and foreign </p><p>governments also monitor what the NDDC does. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>Mixed Review </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. The GON established the NDDC to bring peace and </p><p>development to a troubled region. Is the NDDC living up to </p><p>public expectations? The NDDC believes it is performing </p><p>well, given the funds at its disposal. The oil producing </p><p>states believe the NDDC should share more funding with them. </p><p>NGOs tend to be critical.  We conclude that the NDDC has yet </p><p>to meet this challenge. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. The Niger Delta region boasts numerous NGOs. The most </p><p>notable is MOSOP (the Movement for the Survival of the OGONI </p><p>People), a group that became prominent after the late </p><p>General Abacha hanged Ken Saro Wiwa, MOSOP\'s Ogoni leader </p><p>and eight other activists.  Other NGOs in the area include </p><p>the Niger Delta Human and Environmental Rescue Organization </p><p>(ND-Hero), Environmental Rights Action (ERA), and the Niger </p><p>Delta Wetlands Center. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. Representatives of MOSOP and ND-HERO told EconOff they </p><p>think the NDDC is not performing well. According to these </p><p>contacts, the Presidency dispenses patronage through </p><p>contracts awarded by the NDDC.  In one alleged instance, </p><p>NDDC funds meant for a road in Rivers State were diverted to </p><p>build a hotel in Port Harcourt. In another case, the wife of </p><p>a state governor allegedly benefited from NDDC funds for pet </p><p>projects. In yet another case, the Rivers State government </p><p>claims a bypass allegedly built by the NDDC. A NGO contact </p><p>revealed that this road existed before the NDDC was </p><p>established; the NDDC simply reconditioned it. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>Aid Request </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15. Omene seized the opportunity of EconOff\'s visit to </p><p>request USG assistance.  He said the NDDC wants to identify </p><p>an NGO and funding to address the environmental problems </p><p>resulting from oil and gas exploration and production. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16. The NDDC\'s task is enormous.  It must satisfy the needs </p><p>of disparate local ethnic groups and communities, whose only </p><p>bond is their increasing frustration over the lack of </p><p>development and perceived inattention to their plight at all </p><p>levels of government.  Their grievances include the </p><p>marginalization of minority ethnic groups and distrust of </p><p>the oil companies.  The NDDC must persuade these groups to </p><p>cooperate and to create an enabling environment that can </p><p>sustain development projects.  While it may not be evident </p><p>to the region\'s inhabitants, development will be sustainable </p><p>to the extent that it supports an enabling environment for </p><p>the oil and gas producers in the region. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>17.  The NDDC\'s willingness to implement ad hoc projects, at </p><p>times manipulated by politicians, lends credence to reports </p><p>that the NDDC is not transparent and is incapable of </p><p>managing itself, let alone the development of the Delta </p><p>region. Given its predecessor\'s failures, the NDDC must </p><p>prove itself to its Delta constituency. To succeed, the </p><p>Corporation must engage local communities and ultimately use </p><p>the funds entrusted to it to implement meaningful projects. </p><p>If it does this, the NDDC will have taken steps toward </p><p>promoting economic development and social stability in the </p><p>Delta.  If it does not, the Niger Delta will continue to be </p><p>an area of instability to the detriment of its inhabitants, </p><p>the Nigerian government, and the oil and gas companies </p><p>operating in its midst.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HINSON-JONES </p><p></p></div>
