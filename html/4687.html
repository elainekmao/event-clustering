RANGON 1468 </p><p> </p><p>     B. RANGOON 1248 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) The full text of the Burma Country Commercial Guide is </p><p>available on the internet or via email from </p><p>wohlauerbv@state.gov.  The following is a summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) The U.S. Government has an official policy to neither </p><p>encourage nor discourage trade with Burma.  Since May 1997, </p><p>the U.S. Government has prohibited new investment by U.S. </p><p>persons or entities.  A number of U.S. companies exited the </p><p>Burma market even prior to the imposition of these sanctions, </p><p>however, due to the increasingly poor business climate, and </p><p>mounting criticism in the United States from human rights </p><p>groups, consumers, and some shareholders because of the </p><p>Burmese government\'s serious human rights abuses and lack of </p><p>progress toward democracy.  No new sanctions were applied </p><p>during FY 2001-02, although President Bush has continued the </p><p>national emergency in place regarding the situation in Burma. </p><p> The U.S. Congress has been deliberating a bill that would </p><p>impose additional sanctions on the import of Burmese textiles. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Burma\'s economy remains over 60 percent dependent on </p><p>agriculture and extraction of natural resources.  The </p><p>manufacturing sector makes up only 8 percent of GDP.  Burma\'s </p><p>principal exports are natural gas, garments, beans and </p><p>pulses, teak, and prawns and seafood.  Burma is also one of </p><p>the world\'s leading producers of opiates.  U.S.-Burma trade </p><p>is heavily skewed in favor of Burma.  Burmese garment exports </p><p>to the United States, which more than doubled in 2000 to $415 </p><p>million, fell slightly in 2001 and are headed for a sharper </p><p>decline in 2002.  U.S. exports to Burma, mostly machinery, </p><p>totaled only $11.3 million in 2001 and are also off in 2002. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Most of the population is located in rural areas and </p><p>survives at subsistence levels.  Nearly half the children </p><p>suffers from malnutrition, and many children never enter </p><p>primary school.  Drug use and HIV/AIDS are problems that are </p><p>growing unchecked.  UN agencies and several international </p><p>NGOs are in Burma, but their effectiveness is limited by lack </p><p>of government cooperation and the restrictions many countries </p><p>have on the provision of humanitarian assistance to Burma. </p><p>The country\'s infrastructure, including the telephone </p><p>network, is in a terrible state of disrepair.  Likewise, the </p><p>educational infrastructure is in ruins as the government has </p><p>kept universities closed for much of the past fifteen years. </p><p>As a result, human resources have been severely damaged, with </p><p>potentially serious long-term consequences. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Economic information is very difficult to obtain, as </p><p>the government does not publish reliable data -- or in some </p><p>cases, any data.  The economy suffers from serious economic </p><p>distortions, including an official exchange rate that </p><p>overvalues the Burmese kyat about 200 times.  Expansionary </p><p>monetary policies and state deficit spending have contributed </p><p>to inflation, which rose to over 60 percent for FY 2001-02. </p><p>Foreign exchange is likewise in very short supply, with an </p><p>average of only two or two and one half months of import </p><p>cover throughout FY 2001-02.  The government has responded to </p><p>this foreign exchange shortage by squeezing importers. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) As reported in reftels, we see no sign that the </p><p>government is moving toward improving its investment climate </p><p>or reforming its economic policies.  In the year ahead, this </p><p>ongoing mismanagement will only intensify the impact of </p><p>forthcoming economic blows due to low levels of new foreign </p><p>investment, and probable declines in key exports.  As usual </p><p>the people, some of whom are already relying on government </p><p>rice rations for survival, will bear the brunt of this </p><p>further economic disintegration. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
