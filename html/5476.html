<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 FRANKFURT 000986 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINR, EAIR, GM </p><p>SUBJECT: KOCH AND CDU WIN ABSOLUTE MAJORITY IN HESSE </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) 2002 FRANKFURT 00550; B) FRANKFURT 00682 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) The Hesse CDU, led by Minister President Roland Koch </p><p>won the February 2 elections in Hesse with an absolute </p><p>majority, a first in the state\'s postwar history.  The SPD </p><p>recorded an unprecedented defeat, falling ten percent from </p><p>its 1999 results.  The Green Party received more than 10 </p><p>percent, their second best result ever.  The FDP got more of </p><p>the vote than it had for 30 years, but will no longer be a </p><p>part of the state government.  The results are as follows, </p><p>with the second number showing the change compared with </p><p>1999: </p><p> </p><p>CDU:      48.8 percent (+5.4) </p><p>SPD:      29.1 percent (-10.3) </p><p>Greens:   10.1 percent (+2.9) </p><p>FDP:       7.9 percent (+2.8) </p><p> </p><p>The CDU is Happy, But Nobody Else </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) The CDU now has 56 seats in the 110 seat state </p><p>parliament, the slimmest possible absolute majority, but an </p><p>absolute majority nonetheless.  CDU party followers </p><p>attribute the unprecedented victory mainly to voter </p><p>unhappiness with the national government, but also to </p><p>Minister-President Roland Koch\'s strong performance both in </p><p>the campaign and as state leader.  The new Koch </p><p>administration will certainly use its mandate for bolder CDU </p><p>policy initiatives including Frankfurt airport expansion, </p><p>which Koch energetically promotes.  Some CDU members as well </p><p>as Koch himself did not really want an absolute majority, </p><p>preferring a coalition with the FDP instead.  Koch offered </p><p>the possibility to form a coalition, but the FDP leadership </p><p>refused, stating it would have no leverage under the current </p><p>circumstances. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) The FDP is now the smallest party in the state and </p><p>the mood is mainly negative.  State FDP Chairperson and </p><p>current Justice Minister Ruth Wagner said bitterly, "We </p><p>saved Roland Koch (referring to the CDU financing scandal in </p><p>2000) but he reaps the reward."  The Green Party recorded </p><p>its first state election gain in Germany in five years and </p><p>their second best result ever in Hesse.  The Hesse Greens </p><p>were strong opponents of Frankfurt airport expansion, but </p><p>constituencies in the neighborhood of the airport saw only a </p><p>slight increase in the Green vote. </p><p> </p><p>The Hesse SPD in Shambles </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) The impact of the defeat is enormous within the </p><p>state SPD.  The party had never received less than 36 </p><p>percent of the vote in the state\'s postwar history.  Party </p><p>Chairman and Caucus Chief Gerhard Boekel stepped down from </p><p>both positions following the defeat.  The party now faces a </p><p>serious power vacuum and infighting over its future </p><p>direction.  The times are now gone when Hesse could be </p><p>considered a swing state.  "Hesse is black now," one SPD </p><p>member said, referring to the CDU party\'s color.  The SPD </p><p>won only two of 55 constituencies and lost in nearly all of </p><p>their traditional strongholds.  The SPD results were called </p><p>"disastrous," "catastrophic," and "apocalyptic."  Most SPD </p><p>supporters put the blame on Chancellor Schroeder.  One </p><p>remarked cynically, "We should go and put stickers on our </p><p>campaign posters saying `Thank you Gerhard.\'"  Some said </p><p>Boekel did a good job, but his predecessors (Finance </p><p>Minister Hans Eichel as State Party Chairman and Armin </p><p>Clauss as Caucus Chief) stepped down too late, leaving </p><p>Boekel only a year to campaign.  Chancellor Schroeder\'s </p><p>lukewarm support for Boekel was also viewed as "too little, </p><p>too late."  At SPD caucus headquarters in Wiesbaden on </p><p>election night, hard feelings towards "those in Berlin" were </p><p>barely disguised. </p><p> </p><p>Iraq Did Not Play a Role </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) Despite the SPD\'s last minute scramble with </p><p>petitions against a war in Iraq, most observers agree that </p><p>the Iraq issue did not play any significant role in the </p><p>state elections.  In exit polling, only one percent of the </p><p>voters claimed to have been influenced by Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) Koch\'s victory strengthens his position on both </p><p>state and national levels.  The likelihood of his becoming a </p><p>chancellor candidate in 2006 is now much stronger.  In </p><p>contrast to CDU Party Chair Angela Merkel, Koch can now say </p><p>he delivered Hesse for the CDU while Merkel has never won an </p><p>election.  Koch\'s biggest obstacle will continue to be his </p><p>polarizing personality.  (Hesse Broadcasting presented an </p><p>exit poll on February 2 showing that Koch is the most </p><p>polarizing politician since the late CSU leader and Bavarian </p><p>Minister-President Franz Josef Strauss.)  Koch no longer has </p><p>the FDP to tone down his image and balance his policies.  He </p><p>will have to find ways to accomplish this on his own.  End </p><p>comment. </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) This message has been coordinated with Embassy </p><p>Berlin. </p><p> </p><p>BODDE </p><p></p></div>
