This cable contains an action request.  See para. 9. </p><p> </p><p>2. Summary.  In a productive June 9-10 meeting in Athens, the </p><p>members of the Central Dublin Group reviewed regional reports </p><p>from Central Asia (Italy), Eastern Europe (Germany), </p><p>Southwest Asia (UK) and Southeast Asia and China (Australia). </p><p> Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou addressed the Group </p><p>in connection with the thematic discussion of the "Balkan </p><p>route." Europol, UN Office of Drugs and Crime (ODC) and the </p><p>U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) made presentations.  In </p><p>connection with the 2004 Olympics to be held in Athens, there </p><p>was a brief presentation on sports and doping by officials of </p><p>the Olympic Committee.  It was noted that Spain and the </p><p>United States would switch regional chairs for the next two </p><p>years: Spain would be responsible for the regional report on </p><p>South America and the U.S. for Central America.  The reports </p><p>would be due at the next meeting of the Central Dublin Group </p><p>in December/January 2004.  On the margins of the meeting, the </p><p>Italian delegation asked if the U.S. Embassy in Bishkek could </p><p>take the lead on formation of a Mini Dublin Group in </p><p>Kyrgystan.  This was the first meeting of the Group attended </p><p>by EU accession state members who were there as observers. </p><p>USEU NAS Frank Kerber, INL/PC Program Analyst Maren Brooks, </p><p>and Embassy Athens JHA officer Alfred Schandlbauer attended </p><p>the meeting.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>General Discussion </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3. The thematic discussion of the "Balkan route" was opened </p><p>by Jorge Molling, Deputy Head of the Europol Drugs Unit.  He </p><p>divided the Balkan drug trafficking route into three primary </p><p>sectors: the northern, central and southern routes.  The </p><p>northern route, in turn, could be divided into three: 1) </p><p>Turkey-Bulgaria-Romania-Hungary-Poland; 2) </p><p>Turkey-Bulgaria-Romania-Germany; and 3) </p><p>Turkey-Bulgaria-Serbia-Croatia-Slovenia.  The central route </p><p>is Turkey-Bulgaria-FYROM-Bosnia-Italy. The southern route is </p><p>Turkey-Greece-Albania-Italy).  He noted that 75 percent of </p><p>the heroin in Europe is processed in Turkey by organized </p><p>criminal groups.  Fifteen percent of the Balkan economy is </p><p>based on the illicit drug trade.  The UNODC presentation was </p><p>given by Vladimir Femepetov. He noted that 75 percent of the </p><p>heroin in Europe is processed in Turkey by organized criminal </p><p>groups, and that 15 percent of the Balkan economy is based on </p><p>the illicit drug trade.  Tony Ballas, DEA representative at </p><p>Embassy Athens, said that the Balkan route for contraband, </p><p>illegal narcotics and human trafficking is the prime gateway </p><p>to the Western Europe market.  In addition, the Balkans have </p><p>become a major transfer and storage point.  There has been a </p><p>proliferation of clandestine labs along the route for the </p><p>manufacture and/or synthesis of heroin and synthetic drugs </p><p>like Ecstasy.  The French delegate gave a summary of the </p><p>recommendations of the Ministerial Conference on drug </p><p>trafficking routes from Central Asia to Europe hosted by </p><p>France on May 21-22, 2003. </p><p> </p><p>4. Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou addressed the </p><p>Group, stressing that the interrelation between supply and </p><p>demand for narcotics "should prompt us to examine how we can </p><p>contribute to combating criminalty and whether it is possible </p><p>for drug users to stay away from criminal circles."  He </p><p>stressed the great importance attached by the Greek </p><p>Presidency to problem of drug trafficking, as well as to all </p><p>security issues relating to narcotics smuggling, while </p><p>underlining the need for the EU to formulate a common policy </p><p>on the issue.  Papandreou noted the "polarization" between </p><p>more lenient policies in some European countries and those in </p><p>favor of the present legal structure.  He said it is </p><p>important to hold a continuous dialogue on drug policy with </p><p>all regions of the world, including the U.S., "the leader in </p><p>the area of anti-narcotics policies."  On harm reduction, the </p><p>Foreign Minister said: "I continue to believe that it is a </p><p>justified approach.  There is some ambiguity which allows </p><p>certain misconceptions and criticism by international </p><p>narcotics control agencies of the practices adopted in </p><p>certain (European) countries, as well as hesitation on the </p><p>part of other countries  (read U,S,) to adopt measures which </p><p>have proven effective."   Finally, he called on the EU to </p><p>promote an open dialogue on how to deal with the growing </p><p>problem of cannabis use. </p><p> </p><p>Regional Reports </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. The members reviewed regional reports from Central Asia </p><p>(Italy), Eastern Europe (Germany), Southwest Asia (UK) and </p><p>Southeast Asia and China (Australia).  It was noted that </p><p>Spain and the United States would switch regional chairs for </p><p>the next two years: Spain would be responsible for the </p><p>regional report on South America and the U.S. for Central </p><p>America.  The reports are due at the next meeting of the </p><p>Central Dublin Group in December/January 2004.  On the </p><p>margins of the meeting, the Italian delegation asked if the </p><p>U.S. Embassy in Bishkek could take the lead on formation of a </p><p>Mini Dublin Group in Kyrgystan. </p><p> </p><p>Other Business </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. The chair (Raymond Yans, Belgian consul in Luxembourg) </p><p>announced that the next meeting of the Central Dublin Group </p><p>would be held in Brussels in December or January 2003, </p><p>depending on the availability of meeting rooms at the EU. </p><p>The thematic discussion at this meeting will be the </p><p>toxicological impact of cannabis use.  In this connection, </p><p>the chair asked if the U.S. could provide a scientific expert </p><p>on the subject. </p><p> </p><p>7. The chair noted that several EU ambassadors, including </p><p>Germany and The Netherlands, had asked about the harmful </p><p>health and environmental impact of the U.S. eradication and </p><p>fumigation program in Central and South America.  He asked </p><p>whether the U.S. could provide an expert to discuss this </p><p>issue at the next meeting. </p><p> </p><p>Accession States </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. This was the first meeting to which the EU accession </p><p>states were invited.  Only Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech </p><p>Republic sent observers.  The accession states will continue </p><p>in observer status at the winter meeting, but will assume </p><p>full membership at the summer 2004 session.  These countries </p><p>have converted from their previous status as the subjects of </p><p>Mini Dublin regional reports to that of Dublin Group members </p><p>solely by virtue of their accession to the EU next year. </p><p>Kiyokazu Ota, Minister at the Japanese Mission to the UN in </p><p>Vienna, and Elizabeth Day, Second Secretary at the Australian </p><p>Mission to the UN in Vienna, expressed their concern </p><p>privately to the USDEL that inclusion of all ten accession </p><p>states clearly weighed Central Dublin Group membership in </p><p>favor of the EU (25 to 5), with the U.S., Canada, Japan, </p><p>Australia and Norway the only non-EU members.  They indicated </p><p>their intention to press for a discussion of "Dublin Group" </p><p>membership criteria at the next meeting. </p><p> </p><p>9. Action request.  Please advise whether the U.S. intends to </p><p>provide experts on the health impact of cannabis use as well </p><p>as the U.S. eradication and fumigation program in Central and </p><p>South America at the winter Dublin Group meeting.  Request </p><p>also department thoughts on membership criteria for Dublin </p><p>Group. </p><p> </p><p>FOSTER </p><p></p></div>
