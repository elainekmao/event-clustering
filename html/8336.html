<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 SANAA 001194 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p>FBI FOR DIRECTOR MUELLER FROM AMBASSADOR </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/29/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PTER, KCRM, YM, COUNTER TERRORISM </p><p>SUBJECT: SCENESETTER FOR FBI DIRECTOR MUELLER\'S VISIT TO </p><p>YEMEN </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. SANAA 1078 </p><p>     B. SANAA 1077 </p><p>     C. SANAA 1066 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edmund J. Hull, for Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>Introduction </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>1. (S/NF)  The Ambassador has briefed President Saleh on your </p><p>visit.  Saleh wishes to meet with you and welcomes the </p><p>establishment of a LEGATT office in Sanaa.  As noted in the </p><p>2002 Patterns of Global Terrorism Report, ROYG has provided </p><p>"excellent cooperation with the U.S."  Your visit could </p><p>hardly be better timed.  Having just mounted successful </p><p>parliamentary elections and weathered the anxieties generated </p><p>by the war in Iraq, Saleh and his newly formed government are </p><p>in an upbeat mood as they formulate their agenda for the next </p><p>two years.  CT cooperation with the USG figures prominently </p><p>in that agenda.  Pushing for sustained Yemeni efforts to </p><p>re-capture Cole suspects and enlisting Saleh\'s personal </p><p>support for the LEGATT office should be two primary </p><p>objectives of this visit. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S/NF)  Yemen Minister of Interior (MOI) Alimi also looks </p><p>forward to meeting with you during your visit.  Alimi has </p><p>plans for expanding MOI\'s CT capabilities and has requested </p><p>the FBI\'s cooperation and assistance.  The other key </p><p>interlocutor for you here will be General Ghaleb Gamish, head </p><p>of the Political Security Organization (PSO -- Yemen\'s </p><p>intelligence service).  Both should be included in your </p><p>meeting or luncheon with Saleh. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>OVERVIEW </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  U.S. relations with Yemen, the poorest and most </p><p>populous nation on the Arabian Peninsula, have improved </p><p>steadily in recent years.  Yemen has made commendable </p><p>progress in political and economic reform, and internal </p><p>security. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Since unification in 1990, Yemen has taken numerous </p><p>steps to broaden political participation.  Yemen was the </p><p>first country on the Arabian Peninsula to have universal </p><p>suffrage and the first to have direct presidential elections. </p><p> Yemen held remarkably peaceful and orderly parliamentary </p><p>elections on April 27, and a new cabinet has been appointed. </p><p>The agenda for the new government, which will focus on </p><p>economic development and security, should be released in </p><p>early June. </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>JIBLA TRIAL </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  The trial of Abed Abdulrazak Kamel, confessed </p><p>murderer of three American citizens in Jibla on December 30, </p><p>2002, concluded on May 7.  Kamel was sentenced to death on </p><p>May 10.  Reports indicate that he intends to appeal.  The </p><p>investigation phase of the trial was marked by excellent FBI </p><p>support and U.S.-Yemen cooperation, including joint crime </p><p>scene investigations.  FBI and ROYG officials conducted joint </p><p>interviews with Kamel and all of the witnesses. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>USS COLE </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (S/NF)  On April 11, ten prisoners, including four </p><p>individuals implicated in the attack against the USS Cole, </p><p>escaped from a high-security prison facility in Aden. </p><p>Following the escape the local PSO Chief and the prison </p><p>guards in Aden were questioned, roadblocks were set up, and </p><p>photos of the escapees were carried by major newspapers. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (S/NF)  The re-arrest of the escapees is a matter of the </p><p>highest priority.  President Saleh has assured the Ambassador </p><p>that the ten will be re-captured.  A reward of up to 10 </p><p>million riyals (USD 54,645) has been offered for information </p><p>leading to their arrest. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (S/NF)  Nevertheless, we need to urge continued Yemeni </p><p>efforts or this campaign will flag.  Moreover, if they are </p><p>recaptured, Saleh will almost certainly move to try Quso and </p><p>Bedawi quickly.  He believes the delay in their trail, at </p><p>U.S. behest, kept them alive and in less secure confinement. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>COUNTERTERRORISM </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (S/NF)  The ROYG has been effective in disrupting </p><p>terrorist activities inside Yemen, and taken steps to monitor </p><p>extremist elements.  The ROYG is also responsive and </p><p>effective in providing security for Embassy personnel.  It </p><p>looks to the U.S. for training and financial assistance in </p><p>accomplishing these tasks. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (S/NF)  The ROYG has conducted CT operations throughout </p><p>Yemen to capture key al-Qaida operatives, and has cracked </p><p>down on religious institutions implicated in breeding </p><p>extremism, including Dar al-Hadith institute in Marib and </p><p>Al-Iman University in Sanaa, resulting in the expulsion of </p><p>foreign students.  Yemen is also monitoring its ports of </p><p>entry for entrants from Iraq and Afghanistan.  ROYG has </p><p>provided excellent support to Embassy security, and </p><p>intelligence sharing has improved.  The Yemenis have also </p><p>been supportive of our requests for action against terrorist </p><p>financing sources in Yemen, but this is a field in which </p><p>bilateral cooperation has been limited. </p><p> </p><p>---- </p><p>IRAQ </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (S/NF)  A member of the UN Security Council at the time </p><p>of Iraq\'s 1990 invasion of Kuwait, Yemen allied itself with </p><p>Iraq and voted against the UN resolution authorizing the use </p><p>of force in Iraq during the Gulf War.  Yemen suffered </p><p>greatly.  It was marginalized by its Arab neighbors and over </p><p>a million Yemenis working in Gulf states were sent home. </p><p>U.S. support for Yemen re-unification after the 1994 civil </p><p>war provided an opening for improved relations, and the ROYG </p><p>responded.  Yemen has since issued statements consistent with </p><p>those of the Arab mainstream -- lamenting the suffering of </p><p>the Iraqi people and opposing long-term U.S. occupation of </p><p>Iraq -- but stopped short of denouncing the U.S.  Saleh\'s </p><p>desire to protect relations with the U.S. and the lingering </p><p>economic impact and isolation caused by the ROYG\'s foreign </p><p>policy after the first Gulf War notably softened its </p><p>opposition to Operation Iraqi Freedom. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>REGIONAL ISSUES </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C)  Yemen has actively attempted to repair damage to </p><p>its relations with other Gulf states caused by its support </p><p>for Iraq during the 1991 Gulf War.  Yemen has re-established </p><p>relations with Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, and the border </p><p>dispute with Oman has been resolved.  Yemen has also settled </p><p>the dispute with Eritrea over the Hanish Islands (although </p><p>fishing disputes remain a bilateral irritant), and reached a </p><p>border agreement with Saudi Arabia. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>U.S. ASSISTANCE </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  (S/NF)  The USG continues to help Yemen develop its CT </p><p>capabilities.  U.S. Marines are currently training Yemeni </p><p>security forces in Hodeidah, Sanaa, and Marib; support for </p><p>Yemen\'s economic and political development continues; and </p><p>USAID will re-open in June. </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>THE EMBASSY </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C)  Sanaa is no longer on authorized departure, </p><p>although minor dependents are not permitted at post.  Embassy </p><p>security continues to benefit from ROYG cooperation augmented </p><p>by structural improvements and personal protective measures. </p><p> </p><p>HULL </p><p></p></div>
