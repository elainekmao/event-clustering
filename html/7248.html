<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 COLOMBO 000600 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR SA, SA/INS,D, LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL; NSC FOR E. </p><p>MILLARD </p><p>PASS TO USAID, AMBASSADOR, WENDY CHAMBERLAIN, AA/ANE; </p><p>GORDON WEST, DAA/ANE; JAMES BEVER AND BERNADETTE BUNDY, </p><p>ANE/SA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAID, CE, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT: FIFTH CORE TOKYO GROUP AND WIDER GROUP MEETING </p><p> </p><p>1.  SUMMARY:  The Core Group meeting provided an update on </p><p>the status of the upcoming Seminars, workshops and </p><p>planning sessions in Washington, Colombo and Japan in </p><p>preparation for the June 9-10 Tokyo Donor Conference. The </p><p>agenda for Tokyo is evolving and the latest version </p><p>referenced below has been faxed to the State Desk </p><p>Officer. Topics discussed at the meeting included the </p><p>recently concluded World Bank meetings on Sri Lanka, an </p><p>update on the Washington seminar, the bilateral donor </p><p>draft Principles for Development and Peace paper, </p><p>ADB/WB/UN needs assessment document and the Sri </p><p>Lanka/Japan private sector meeting following the Tokyo </p><p>Donor Conference. END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>2.   Minister Moragoda chaired. He reported on his </p><p>positive meetings with the EU and some member country </p><p>representatives and thanked the EU for agreeing to co- </p><p>chair the Tokyo Donor Conference.  He indicated that one </p><p>of the topics discussed with the EU was the need for an </p><p>expanded Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission. </p><p> </p><p>3.   Minister Moragoda will hold bilateral meetings with </p><p>Canada and Holland on the margins of the Washington </p><p>seminar and will also meet with the UN Secretary General </p><p>Anan and World Bank President Wolfensohn.  Other meetings </p><p>may be scheduled.  The Minister said that the Indian </p><p>Ambassador to Washington was likely to attend since the </p><p>Indian Finance Minister will not attend the World Bank </p><p>meetings. </p><p> </p><p>4.   The Japanese Ambassador reported on the changes in </p><p>the draft Tokyo Conference agenda based on meetings held </p><p>with the Multilaterals on April 4 in Tokyo as follows: </p><p> </p><p>--    In Plenary Session 2 following Norway\'s general </p><p>remarks, summary reports will be given on the outcome of </p><p>the Colombo Civil Society and Private Sector meetings. </p><p>Three new organizations have been invited to participate </p><p>in the Tokyo meeting: IFAD, IOM and OPEC. The Japanese </p><p>Ambassador indicated that the World Bank remarks might be </p><p>moved from the concluding session to one of the plenary </p><p>sessions. </p><p> </p><p>--   In the First Operative Session the ADB and UNDP will </p><p>talk on the Needs Assessment and in the Second Operative </p><p>Session the World Bank and IMF will report on Sri Lanka\'s </p><p>economic performance and reconstruction and development </p><p>agenda. </p><p> </p><p>5.   The World Bank\'s representative, Peter Harrold, </p><p>reported on the PRSP/Regaining Sri Lanka and CAS review. </p><p>Support was strong among Board members for overall </p><p>lending with approval of $850 million over four years </p><p>with the provision for up to one billion based on </p><p>performance. Harrold said that if the World Bank meeting </p><p>was the curtain raiser for Tokyo, it would appear that </p><p>now is the time for support to Sri Lanka.  He also </p><p>indicated that a two hour meeting was held with US </p><p>officials prior to the Board review.  Minister Moragoda </p><p>told the group that the GSL needed to look at the </p><p>concerns raised at the meeting and address them.  These </p><p>concerns mainly revolved around the issue of sufficient </p><p>consultations prior to drafting the Regaining Sri Lanka </p><p>document.  Harold suggested that there should be a </p><p>renewed emphasis on an ongoing consultation process and </p><p>there was a particular need to establish a mechanism for </p><p>consultations with civil society. </p><p> </p><p>6.   Ambassador Wills informed the group of efforts to </p><p>devise a statement of principles by bilateral donors to </p><p>be put before the negotiating sides prior to Tokyo, </p><p>preferably at the next round of talks.  If widely </p><p>accepted, the document will be issued at the Tokyo </p><p>Conference.   Minister Moragoda emphasized that while he </p><p>and the GSL supported the idea of such a paper, he didn\'t </p><p>want the GSL\'s economic program stalled as a result. </p><p>Ambassador Westborg, who had participated in discussions </p><p>on the Principles paper, said the sooner the paper came </p><p>out the better to allow time for the two sides to review </p><p>and discuss it. Ambassador Wills commented that he did </p><p>not want representatives from either side to think that </p><p>the donors were ganging up on them. The Japanese </p><p>Ambassador, who has been reluctant to discuss openly the </p><p>"Principles" paper, has greatly softened his position </p><p>after meeting with Ambassador Wills and the small group </p><p>of other bilateral donor principals. The Japanese </p><p>Ambassador agreed with Ambassador Wills that the document </p><p>should be provided to the two sides as expeditiously as </p><p>possible and that the message should be succinct and </p><p>pragmatic.  The objective was not to scare off the LTTE </p><p>and jeopardize their participation in Tokyo.  Ambassador </p><p>Wills quipped that if the "Principles" scared them off, </p><p>we don\'t want to give them money anyway!" </p><p> </p><p>7.  Peter Harrold reported that the Needs Assessment </p><p>document had been completed and had just been sent to the </p><p>GSL and the LTTE simultaneously.  The GSL and the LTTE </p><p>have just been given a copy of the Multilateral Needs </p><p>Assessment.  The GSL will forward it to donors, civil </p><p>society and the private sector in the next two days but </p><p>the timeframe with comments due by April 22 in </p><p>preparation for the next round of peace talks on April </p><p>29. </p><p> </p><p>8.   According to Harrold, the cost estimates arising from </p><p>the needs assesment have gone down from 1.6 to 1.3 billion </p><p>since the donor briefing last week and greater attention </p><p>has been paid to phasing to take into account capacity to </p><p>absorb the funds.  Minister Moragoda expressed concern </p><p>about the possible macro economic implication of the </p><p>package and about the raised expectations on the part of </p><p>the LTTE as to how quickly funding would be implemented. </p><p>It was agreed that the IMF would run a macroeconomic </p><p>filter through. Ambassador Wills sought clarification of a </p><p>comment made at the last meeting that the LTTE would only </p><p>agree to </p><p>projects that provided state-of-art reconstruction and </p><p>equipment.  Harrold indicated that the LTTE had become </p><p>more pragmatic in saying that what it wanted was for </p><p>the North and the East to get to the level of the rest of </p><p>the country and then march forward together. The World </p><p>Bank representative told the group that in terms of </p><p>volume, time and phasing, the Assessment was considered </p><p>practical. </p><p> </p><p>9.    The Japanese Ambassador reviewed Tokyo\'s comments </p><p>on the planning process for the Colombo seminar and the </p><p>Tokyo civil society and private sector meetings.  Tokyo </p><p>is currently planning a meeting for civil society, </p><p>Japanese NGOs, the GSL and LTTE on June 8 and a private </p><p>sector meeting covering trade, investment and tourism on </p><p>June 9. </p><p> </p><p>10.  The Japanese are looking to the GSL to provide a </p><p>comprehensive incentive package to attract Japanese </p><p>investors, a package with data on investment </p><p>opportunities and a package of measures on deregulation, </p><p>tax schemes, access to resources and infrastructure. On </p><p>May 6 Japanese officials and representatives of the two </p><p>largest Sri Lankan Chambers of Commerce have been invited </p><p>to a meeting to provide the private sector view about </p><p>what is needed to attract foreign investment.  The </p><p>Japanese Chamber of Commerce will organize the private </p><p>sector meeting.  Ambassador Wills suggested that the US </p><p>would be interested in hearing about the package of </p><p>incentives the GSL was putting together in preparation </p><p>for the private sector meeting in Japan. </p><p> </p><p>11.  The Wider Tokyo Group meeting followed immediately </p><p>after that of the Core Group.  Minister Moragoda thanked </p><p>the EU for agreeing to co-host the Tokyo meeting and for </p><p>the positive meetings he had in Brussels. He also took </p><p>the opportunity to thank the donors who supported the GSL </p><p>at the recent World Bank Board meeting. Since the IMF </p><p>conditions have all been met, the Minister was hopeful </p><p>that the review would also go smoothly.  The Minister </p><p>then provided a summary of the status of preparations for </p><p>the Colombo meetings and asked for short briefings from </p><p>the Japanese Ambassador, the World Bank, UN </p><p>representatives and Ambassador Wills. Peter Harrold </p><p>provided a status report on the Needs Assessment and the </p><p>timing for comments as discussed in number 7 & 8. </p><p> </p><p>12.  COMMENT:  The Japanese Ambassador and GOJ appear to </p><p>be more favorably disposed to the idea of a Principles </p><p>paper but are concerned about the reaction of the LTTE. </p><p>Although there continues to be wordsmithing on the </p><p>Principles paper, feedback from the other donors has been </p><p>Positive.  (The draft statement of principles will be </p><p>cabled to Washington by septel.)  After initial feedback </p><p>on the findings of the Needs Assessment, we are told that </p><p>the document has been revised to reflect greater </p><p>prioritization, sequencing and attention to absorptive </p><p>capacity. The GSL is particularly concerned that the </p><p>assessment fit in the economic framework but others are </p><p>concerned about raising unrealistic expectations on the </p><p>speed with which this level of assistance can be </p><p>implemented. END COMMENT </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
