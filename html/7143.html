UNHCR has heard anecdotal reports of two to three thousand Iraqis </p><p>fleeing Basrah.  On 31 March, Coalition forces deemed the coastal land </p><p>route to Umm Qasr a permissive environment.  NGO convoys traveling to </p><p>Umm Qasr will need to coordinate their movements through the HOC.  On 3 </p><p>March, UNICEF reported that there are no confirmed cases of cholera in </p><p>As Sulaymaniyah.  A 29 March rapid assessment conducted by Coalition </p><p>forces reported that the population of An Nasiriyah is in need of </p><p>water, baby formula, and basic medical supplies.  On 30 March, a </p><p>UNICEF-sponsored convoy of 14 water tankers crossed into Iraq to delive </p><p>water to residents of Safwan, Umm Qasr, and Az Zubayr.  The cargo of th </p><p>Sir Galahad has been fully off-loaded in Umm Qasr. On 29 March, the DAR </p><p>met with representatives from IOM to discuss plans to incorporate </p><p>protection issues into IOM\'s programs.  During the HOC briefing on 29 </p><p>March, an update on the status of borders in the region was provided. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>POPULATION DISPLACEMENTS </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  A spokesman from the Humanitarian Operations Center (HOC) reported </p><p>that  5,000 residents are displaced around the Az Zubayr bridge, near </p><p>Basrah. Coalition forces are providing relief supplies, and the </p><p>condition of the displaced persons is reported to be stable. </p><p> </p><p>3.  In a meeting with the DART on March 29, the Head of the United </p><p>Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Kuwait office expressed </p><p>concern over a lack of cooperation by the Government of Kuwait (GOK) in </p><p>preparing for potential Iraqi refugees. UNHCR heard the GOK was </p><p>preparing several camps for Iraqis in the border area but when </p><p>the issue was raised with Kuwaiti officials, UNHCR was informed that </p><p>the borders are closed and no refugees would be allowed in.  UNHCR has </p><p>stated that it is only willing to help establish refugee camps inside </p><p>Kuwait if the borders are kept open. </p><p> </p><p>4.  UNHCR has heard anecdotal reports of two to three thousand Iraqis </p><p>fleeing Basrah east toward the Iranian border, but has received no </p><p>reports that the refugees arrived at the border.  It is not known if </p><p>these people returned home or are housed with extended family or friend </p><p>outside the city. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>SECURITY - SOUTHERN IRAQ </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5.  On 31 March, Coalition forces deemed the coastal land route to Umm </p><p>Qasr a permissive environment.  NGO convoys or relief vehicles travelin </p><p>to Umm Qasr will need to coordinate their movements through the HOC. </p><p> Coalition forces will inform humanitarian convoys of the area\'s </p><p>security status and may provide escort. However, military escort will </p><p>not be provided for travel to areas not cleared as safe by the </p><p>Coalition. </p><p> </p><p>6.  On 1 April, UNSECOORD conducted a security assessment of Umm Qasr. </p><p>If the findings of the security assessment are approved by U.N. </p><p>Headquarters in New York, the UNSECOORD security officer will send a </p><p>humanitarian assessment team to Umm Qasr on or about 2 April </p><p>to begin to establish a U.N. presence in Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>COALITION ASSESSMENT OF AN NASIRIYAH </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>7.  A 29 March rapid assessment conducted by Coalition forces reported </p><p>that the population of An Nasiriyah is in need of water, baby formula, </p><p>and basic medical supplies.  A local town leader reported that the </p><p>population has sufficient stocks of basic foods to last for eight </p><p>months, but fresh meats, vegetables, and fruits are needed. Coalition </p><p>forces reportedly seized the main government warehouse that stored food </p><p>for the OFF program. The warehouse is reported to contain significant </p><p>food stocks. </p><p> </p><p>8.  Iraqi forces have reportedly intimidated the local population with </p><p>loudspeaker instructions to leave their homes in order to slow the </p><p>Coalition advance.  Individuals have also been intimidated by death </p><p>threats to military-age males who refuse to fight the Coalition. </p><p> </p><p>9.  According to local sources, the police have fled An Nasiriyah, all </p><p>the hospitals and many businesses are closed, and roads into the town </p><p>are currently blocked.  The An Nasiriyah Military Hospital was badly </p><p>damaged, but the hospital still contains a large inventory of </p><p>pharmaceuticals and medical supplies.  There is a limited amount of </p><p>electricity and water, and there are no telephones in service. </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>WATER </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p>10.  On 30 March, a UNICEF-sponsored convoy of 14 water tankers crossed </p><p>into Iraq to deliver water to residents of Safwan, Umm Qasr, and Az </p><p>Zubayr.  One additional truck, carrying 15 water bladders to the three </p><p>towns, was delayed by Kuwaiti police because of a documentation problem </p><p> The HOC is working to resolve the issue with the Ministry of Interior. </p><p> The DART\'s Military Liaison Unit (MLU) is also tracking this issue. </p><p> </p><p>11.  The water will be distributed by staff members at the hospitals in </p><p>Umm Qasr and Az Zubayr, and by staff at the Primary Health Center in </p><p>Safwan.  UNICEF reports that this convoy will occur daily, and thus </p><p>enable Coalition forces to use their water tankers to supply residents </p><p>in towns further north that are not secure enough for civilian workers. </p><p> </p><p>12.  A ceremony was scheduled for 31 March to open the water pipeline </p><p>from Kuwait towards Umm Qasr.  The pipeline is expected to provide 2.7 </p><p>million liters of water per day to southern Iraq.  Coalition forces and </p><p>UNICEF-sponsored convoys will provide tankers to deliver water from </p><p>the pipe\'s outlet to southern Iraqi populations in need. </p><p>------ </p><p>HEALTH </p><p>------ </p><p> </p><p>13.  On 31 March, UNICEF reported that there are no confirmed cases of </p><p>cholera in As Sulaymaniyah.  UNICEF is aware of three cases of cholera </p><p>in An Nasariyah in February, and reported that a few cases  of cholera </p><p>occur in the area each year. UNICEF provided one million sachets of ora </p><p>rehydration salts  to local UNICEF representative Iraq in February but </p><p>has no information on how the supplies might have been distributed. </p><p> </p><p>---- </p><p>FOOD </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p>14.  There is no mill at the port of Umm Qasr.  The closest mills are </p><p>in Basrah, where there are eleven.  The vacuvators at Umm Qasr are able </p><p>to work, but the power supply remains questionable.  The DART is trying </p><p>to find a person at the port who can conduct a "mega test" to measure </p><p>the electrical system\'s capacity. </p><p> </p><p>15.  The cargo of the Sir Galahad has been fully off-loaded in Umm </p><p>Qasr.  A distribution plan was not made available through the HOC. </p><p> However, on 31 March the HOC reported that the waterway into Umm Qasr </p><p>Port is non-permissive for humanitarian vessels due to the recent </p><p>discovery of unexploded ordinances. </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>NON-FOOD ITEMS </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>16.  By 31 March, UNHCR plans to have enough non-food items stocked in </p><p>the region for 300,000 people. UNHCR wanted to pre-position enough </p><p>supplies in the region to handle 600,000 refugees but does not </p><p> currently have the necessary funding. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>PROTECTION </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>17.  On 29 March, the DART met with representatives from the </p><p>International Organization for Migration (IOM) to discuss plans to </p><p>incorporate protection issues into IOM\'s programs. IOM will be working </p><p>closely with the U.N. Humanitarian Coordinator for Iraq (UNOCHI), </p><p>which will take the lead on protection concerns in IDP camps. </p><p> </p><p>18.  UNOCHI will have five regional officers, each with a regional </p><p>coordinator.  UNOCHI will include an IDP protection officer in each </p><p>region. </p><p> </p><p>19.  The DART members urged IOM to address protection concerns and ways </p><p>to mitigate abuses and to develop response mechanisms at the camp level </p><p>in its overall strategy and programming.  The DART promised </p><p>to share protection documents with IOM staff in Kuwait.  IOM reported </p><p>that each camp manager will be aware  of protection concerns and report </p><p>abuses to UNOCHI. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>BORDERS </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>20.  During the HOC briefing on 29 March, an update on the status of </p><p>borders in the region was provided. </p><p> </p><p>21.  Between Turkey and Iraq, the Habur border crossing point (BCP) is </p><p>open on Turkish side but not operating on Iraqi side. Consequently, </p><p>legal trans-border transportation is not possible. The Cukurca BCP </p><p>remains under military control and is closed for any civil/humanitarian </p><p>activity. The borders between Turkey and Syria remain open. </p><p> </p><p>22.  Between Kuwait and Iraq, the borders of Abdaly and Umm Qasr remain </p><p>officially closed, though some local NGOs have delivered supplies from </p><p>Kuwait into Southern Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>23.  Between Jordan and Iraq, the Trebil BCP is open to humanitarian </p><p>and commercial traffic. For humanitarian traffic, a security pass and </p><p>vehicle sticker obtained in Amman from the Ministry of Interiors (MoI) </p><p>is required to enter the border security zone.  A separate pass </p><p>obtained  from  the MoI in Amman is required to access refugee camps in </p><p>the border area. </p><p> </p><p>24.  All borders between Iran and Iraq remain closed.  The borders </p><p>between Syria and Iraq are open, however, negligible commercial </p><p>trans-border movement has been observed by Coalition forces. </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
