CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p>- </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  A YEAR AFTER KHOMEINI\'S DEATH, IRAN\'S </p><p>LEADERS ARE DIVIDED OVER THE COUNTRY\'S FUTURE POLITICAL </p><p>DIRECTION.  THEIR DISAGREEMENTS, ALTHOUGH SOMETIMES </p><p>EXPRESSED IN OBSCURE THEOLOGICAL TERMS, ARE ON DISPLAY </p><p>IN VIGOROUS DEBATES IN THE MEDIA, PARLIAMENT, FRIDAY </p><p>SERMONS, AND OTHER PUBLIC SPEECHES. THIS DEBATE, </p><p>HOWEVER, IS FOR INSIDERS ONLY, AND THE OPINIONS OF </p><p>THOSE OUTSIDE THE RULING ELITE ARE NEITHER SOUGHT NOR </p><p>CONSIDERED.  WHILE THE POLITICIANS ARGUE, THE ECONOMY </p><p>CONTINUES TO STAGNATE.  EFFORTS TO REVIVE DOMESTIC </p><p>PRODUCTION, REBUILD THE OIL INDUSTRY, AND CONTROL </p><p>RUINOUS INFLATION HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY INADEQUATE. </p><p>HAVING MADE A REVOLUTION THAT REJECTED ECONOMICS AS A </p><p>BASIS OF NATIONAL POLICY, THE NEW LEADERS ARE FINDING </p><p>THAT PART OF KHOMEINI\'S LEGACY VERY DIFFICULT TO </p><p>CHANGE, NOR IS THERE YET ANY OVERWHELMING PRESSURE ON </p><p>THEM TO DO SO.  APATHY IS MORE PREVALENT THAN </p><p>RESISTANCE AND THERE SEEMS NO SIGNIFICANT ORGANIZED </p><p>OPPOSITION THAT WOULD THREATEN THE REVOLUTION ITSELF. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p>- </p><p>- </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>THE FEW RULE AND ARGUE; THE MANY WATCH </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  THE MASS POLITICS, WHICH CHARACTERIZED THE IRANIAN </p><p>REVOLUTION AND THE EARLY YEARS OF THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC, </p><p>ARE OVER.  PERHAPS THE LAST MANIFESTATION WAS </p><p>KHOMEINI\'S FUNERAL.  GONE ARE THE MILLION-STRONG </p><p>MARCHES AND DEMONSTRATIONS WHICH PROCLAIMED "DEATH TO </p><p>THIS" OR "LONG LIVE THAT".  NOW, ZEALOTS COMPLAIN WHEN </p><p>IRANIAN RADIO TV IGNORES TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE </p><p>DEMONSTRATING AGAINST WOMEN\'S IMMORAL DRESS (REFTEL). </p><p>AND A TEHRAN UNIVERSITY PROTEST AGAINST U.S.-IRAN TIES </p><p>IS ALMOST IGNORED. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>4.  IRAN\'S LEADERS ARE IN THE BUNKER WHERE THEY </p><p>SQUABBLE LOUDLY AMONG THEMSELVES.  THE SUPERNUMERARIES </p><p>WHO USED TO MARCH AND SHOUT, HOWEVER, NOW ONLY WATCH. </p><p>MOST OF THEM HAVE SHIFTED FROM SUPPORTING THE REGIME TO </p><p>ENDURING IT.  THEY GRASP AT ANY SIGN, SUCH AS ANOTHER </p><p>INCH MORE EXPOSURE OF WOMEN\'S HAIR, OR FIVE MINUTES </p><p>MORE MUSIC ON IRAN RADIO, THAT MIGHT INDICATE THINGS </p><p>ARE GETTING BETTER. </p><p>- </p><p>5.  BASED ON OUR OBSERVATION, WE WOULD ILLUSTRATE THE </p><p>BREAKDOWN OF IRANIAN POPULATION ROUGHLY AS FOLLOWS: </p><p> </p><p>(A) 0.5 PERCENT ARE IN THE REGIME. </p><p> </p><p>(B) 2.5 PERCENT SUPPORT IT. </p><p> </p><p>(C) 2.5 PERCENT OPPOSE IT. </p><p> </p><p>(D) THE REST (94.5 PERCENT) ENDURE IT. </p><p> </p><p>THOSE IN THE REGIME ARE TWO GROUPS:  AN OUTER CIRCLE OF </p><p>THOSE WHO, THROUGH POSITIONS IN THE GUARDS, THE ISLAMIC </p><p>COMMITTEES, ETC. HAVE ACCESS TO SCARCE GOODS AND </p><p>SERVICES SUCH AS SUBSIDIZED CONSUMER GOODS AT </p><p>SUBSIDIZED PRICES, REASONABLE HOUSING, AND UNIVERSITY </p><p>PLACES.  AN INNER CIRCLE OF ABOUT 5,000 SENIOR CLERICS, </p><p>MINISTERS, JUDGES, FRIDAY PREACHERS, PARLIAMENT </p><p>DEPUTIES, AND PROVINCIAL OFFICIALS, ACTUALLY RULE </p><p>IRAN.  WITHIN THIS GROUP. TWENTY-TO-THIRTY VETERANS OF </p><p>REVOLUTIONARY POLITICS MAKE THE DECISIONS.  THIS LAST </p><p>GROUP INCLUDES SUCH SURVIVORS AS AYATOLLAHS ARDABILI, </p><p>YAZDI, MESHKINI, JANNATI, MAHDAVI-KANI, AND REYSHAHRI. </p><p>OTHER MEMBERS ARE PRESIDENT HASHEMI-RAFSANJANI, SUPREME </p><p>LEADER KHAMENE\'I, MASHHAD BOSS VA\'EZ TABASI, PARLIAMENT </p><p>SPEAKER MAHDI KARROUBI, AND FORMER INTERIOR MINISTER </p><p>MOHTASHEMI-POUR. </p><p>- </p><p>6.  MEMBERS OF THIS GROUP ARE INTERCHANGEABLE PARTS OF </p><p>A MACHINE.  LONG PERSONAL ASSOCIATIONS AND TIES OF </p><p>MARRIAGE AND BUSINESS GIVE THIS GROUP ITS COHESION. </p><p>WHEN ONE MEMBER IS ELIMINATED BY DEATH, NATURAL OR </p><p>OTHERWISE, ANOTHER REPLACES HIM AND POLICIES CONTINUE. </p><p>DESPITE PERSONAL RIVALRIES, MEMBERS SHARE A LOVE OF </p><p>POWER, A DETERMINATION TO HOLD IT AT ALL COSTS, AND A </p><p>WORLD VIEW SHAPED BY KHOMEINI\'S UNCOMPROMISING AND </p><p>IDIOSYNCRATIC VISION OF A UTOPIAN ISLAMIC STATE. </p><p>- </p><p>7.  WITHIN THE ELITE, THERE IS FREE-WHEELING VIGOROUS </p><p>DEBATE WHICH OFTEN SPILLS INTO PUBLIC VIEW.  BUT THIS </p><p>DEBATE IS BY AND FOR INSIDERS.  OUTSIDERS -- BE THEY </p><p>CLERICS LIKE AYATOLLAH MONTAZERI OR NATIONALISTS LIKE </p><p>MAHDI BAZARGAN -- ARE NOT WELCOME TO PARTICIPATE.  MOST </p><p>IRANIANS ARE OF COURSE FREE TO WATCH AND LISTEN TO </p><p>THEIR BETTERS ARGUE, BUT OUTSIDERS\' OPINIONS ARE </p><p>NEITHER SOLICITED NOR CONSIDERED.  THE ELITE HAS SHOWN </p><p>THAT, WHEN THREATENED OR QUESTIONED, IT CAN ACT </p><p>DECISIVELY AND BRUTALLY. </p><p>- </p><p>- </p><p>------------------- </p><p>GUARDIANS OF PURITY </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  THE CURRENT LEADERS ARE DIVIDED OVER WHETHER IRAN </p><p>MUST CHANGE ITS MILITANT, REJECTIONIST POLICIES IN </p><p>ORDER TO ESTABLISH NORMAL RELATIONS WITH THE OUTSIDE </p><p>WORLD AND REBUILD HER ECONOMY.  ON ONE SIDE ARE THOSE </p><p>WHO PUSH ECONOMIC RECONSTRUCTION AND ARGUE THAT UNDER </p><p>PRESENT CONDITIONS A POLICY OF CONFRONTATION, SLOGANS </p><p>AND HARSH SOCIAL RESTRICTIONS HAS ALIENATED BOTH </p><p>IRANIANS AND FOREIGNERS FROM KHOMEINI\'S ISLAMIC </p><p>UTOPIA.  THEY SAY THAT IRAN, WITH HER MATURE </p><p>REVOLUTION, NO LONGER HAS ANYTHING TO FEAR FROM STABLE, </p><p>PREDICTABLE RELATIONS WITH OTHER STATES AND SYSTEMS. </p><p>SUCH RELATIONS MAY EVEN BRING IRAN ECONOMIC AND </p><p>POLITICAL BENEFITS. </p><p>- </p><p>9.  ON THE OTHER SIDE ARE THOSE WHO, WHILE NOT </p><p>EXPLICITLY OPPOSED TO RECONSTRUCTION OR IMPROVED LIVING </p><p>CONDITIONS, RESIST THE POLITICAL AND SOCIAL CHANGES </p><p>SUCH STEPS WOULD REQUIRE.  FOR THEM, GUARDING THE </p><p>PURITY OF KHOMEINI\'S VISION COMES BEFORE ALL THINGS. </p><p>THEIR BANNER IS THE "IMAM\'S LINE", A SHORTHAND FOR </p><p>NEGATIVE AND SIMPLISTIC THINKING THAT HAS LED TO THE </p><p>ISLAMIC REPUBLIC\'S EXCESSES AND SELF-DESTRUCTIVE </p><p>POLICIES.  IF GUARDING THAT VISION MEANS IRAN\'S </p><p>CURRENCY IS WORTHLESS, THAT HER FACTORIES PRODUCE </p><p>NOTHING, AND THAT HER OIL INDUSTRY CONTINUES TO </p><p>DETERIORATE, THEN SO BE IT.  SUCH THINGS WERE NEVER </p><p>IMPORTANT TO THE IMAM AND WHY SHOULD THE GUARDIANS OF </p><p>HIS LEGACY CONSIDER SUCH THINGS? </p><p>- </p><p>- </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>NOW FOR THE VERY BAD NEWS </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  THE IRANIAN ECONOMY IS A DISASTER.  EVEN THOSE WHO </p><p>BENEFIT BY SPECULATIONS IN CURRENCIES AND SCARCE </p><p>COMMODITIES ADMIT THAT SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE TO </p><p>RESTART ECONOMIC ENGINES THAT HAVE BEEN SHUT DOWN SINCE </p><p>1979.  THE IRANIAN RIAL IS ALMOST WORTHLESS (NOW </p><p>TRADING AT ABOUT 1350 TO THE U.S. DOLLAR) AND THE </p><p>RESULTING INFLATION HAS DESTROYED THE PURCHASING POWER </p><p>OF WAGE AND SALARY EARNERS AND OF PENSIONERS.  TOP </p><p>GOVERNMENT SALARIES ARE EQUIVALENT TO USD 150 PER </p><p>MONTH, AND MOST EMPLOYEES MUST HAVE SECOND JOBS. </p><p>- </p><p>11.  IRANIAN INDUSTRY IS PRODUCING AT ABOUT THIRTY </p><p>PERCENT OF CAPACITY.  MUCH OF IRAN\'S FOREIGN CURRENCY </p><p>EARNINGS GO FOR IMPORTS OF FOOD AND CONSUMER GOODS - </p><p>REFRIGERATORS, TELEVISIONS, CAR BATTERIES, TIRES, ETC. </p><p>-- WHICH HAVE NO DIRECT AFFECT ON PRODUCTIVITY. </p><p>OVER-REGULATION OF IMPORTS HAS LED TO CORRUPTION AND </p><p>PROFITEERING AS SUBSIDIZED GOODS IMPORTED UNDER STATE </p><p>LICENSES ARE DIVERTED TO THE FREE MARKET FOR LARGE </p><p>PROFITS.  MANY ENTERPRISES ARE UNDER CONTROL OF THE </p><p>LARGE "FOUNDATIONS" WHICH HAVE STRANGLED PRODUCTIVITY </p><p>AND PROFITS IN THE NAME OF ISLAMIC SOCIAL JUSTICE. </p><p>- </p><p>12.  IRAN HAS AN ENORMOUS HIDDEN DEBT WHICH SOME </p><p>ESTIMATE AT USD 200-300 BILLION.  THIS DEBT IS WHAT </p><p>IRAN DID NOT SPEND IN THE LAST TEN YEARS ON THE OIL </p><p>INDUSTRY, ROADS, POWER STATIONS, PORTS, SCHOOLS AND </p><p>HOSPITALS.  IT IS ALSO WHAT SHE DID NOT EARN FROM </p><p>NEGLECTED OR RUINED INVESTMENTS.  INSTEAD, IRAN FOR TEN </p><p>YEARS PUMPED AND SOLD CRUDE OIL TO BUY FOOD AND </p><p>WEAPONS, AND INVESTED ALMOST NOTHING IN HER ECONOMY. </p><p>FROM 1978, HUNDREDS OF PROJECTS -- FROM THOSE STILL ON </p><p>PAPER TO THOSE NEEDING ONLY THREE BOLTS TO FINISH -- </p><p>WERE ABANDONED AND LEFT FOR RUST AND VANDALS TO DESTROY. </p><p>- </p><p>13.  AS A DELIBERATE POLICY, THE AUTHORITIES ENCOURAGED </p><p>THOUSANDS OF IRANIANS, WHO COULD NOT ADJUST TO THE </p><p>RESTRICTIONS OF LIFE IN AN ISLAMIC REPUBLIC, TO LEAVE </p><p>THE COUNTRY.  ALTHOUGH OFFICIALS TALK ABOUT THEIR </p><p>RETURN, THERE ARE FEW SIGNS THAT THE ORIGINAL POLICIES </p><p>THAT DROVE THEM OUT ARE CHANGING.  MANY TRAINED AND </p><p>WELL-EDUCATED IRANIANS WHO HAVE NOT LEFT HAVE, FOR BOTH </p><p>ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL REASONS, GIVEN UP WORKING IN </p><p>THEIR SPECIALTIES AND EARN A LIVING IN THE FLOURISHING </p><p>BLACK MARKET.  OTHERS, WHO HAVE STUCK IT OUT FOR TEN </p><p>YEARS IN THE HOPE OF BETTER TIMES, ARE GIVING UP AND </p><p>LOOKING FOR ESCAPE ROUTES. </p><p>- </p><p>14.  THE ECONOMIC AGREEMENTS WITH THE SOVIET UNION WERE </p><p>FOR SHOW ONLY.  GIVEN IRAN\'S ENORMOUS ECONOMIC NEEDS, </p><p>THE AMOUNTS INVOLVED ARE INSIGNIFICANT.  THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S MAIN PURPOSES WERE POLITICAL:  TO SHOW </p><p>THAT IRAN HAD FRIENDS IN THE OUTSIDE WORLD AND TO SHOW </p><p>THE PEOPLE THAT THE GOVERNMENT WAS "DOING SOMETHING" IN </p><p>THE ECONOMIC SPHERE. </p><p>- </p><p>- </p><p>-------------- </p><p>POOR PROSPECTS </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>15.  POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC PROSPECTS ARE POOR. </p><p>ALTHOUGH SOME INDIVIDUALS WITHIN THE LEADERSHIP SAY </p><p>IRAN MUST GIVE UP BANKRUPT SLOGANS AND STOP MAKING </p><p>NEEDLESS ENEMIES, THEIR VIEWS HAVE NOT LED TO ANY </p><p>CONSISTENT NEW POLICY.  ONE DAY LEADERS SPEAK OF </p><p>TOLERANCE, THE NEXT DAY THEY LAUNCH A NEW CAMPAIGN </p><p>AGAINST UNISLAMIC DRESS AND BEHAVIOR.  TALK OF CHANGE </p><p>HAS REMAINED TALK, APPARENTLY MUCH OF IT AIMED AT </p><p>CONVINCING FOREIGNERS TO EXTEND CREDITS AND MAKE </p><p>INVESTMENTS.  SLOGANEERING AND IDEOLOGY MAY NO LONGER </p><p>HAVE THE MASS APPEAL OF TEN YEARS AGO, BUT THEY ARE </p><p>STILL POWERFUL WEAPONS IN TEHRAN\'S POWER STRUGGLES. </p><p>MANY OF TODAY\'S LEADERS CAME TO POWER BY IMITATING </p><p>KHOMEINI\'S OBSTINATE REFUSAL TO COMPROMISE, AND THEY </p><p>WILL NOT EASILY ABANDON THIS FORMULA. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>16.  IRAN\'S POPULATION GROWTH IS OUT OF CONTROL, </p><p>GROWING AT MORE THAN THREE PERCENT PER YEAR.  THE </p><p>COMBINATION OF POPULATION GROWTH AND NO INVESTMENT </p><p>MEANS THAT SERVICES -- SCHOOLS, WATER, TRANSPORT, AND </p><p>ELECTRICITY -- ARE BREAKING DOWN UNDER THE PRESSURE. </p><p>AFTER LIVING OFF THE STORED FAT FROM THE PREVIOUS </p><p>REGIME FOR TEN YEARS, IRAN WILL EITHER HAVE TO MAKE </p><p>RADICAL POLITICAL CHANGES TO REBUILD OR RESIGN ITSELF </p><p>TO PERMANENT THIRD-WORLD POVERTY. </p><p>- </p><p>- </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>POLITICAL BACKSWING NOT EVIDENT </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>17.  DETERIORATING LIVING STANDARDS AND THE LACK OF </p><p>CHARISMATIC LEADERSHIP HAS, AND WILL, LEAD TO OUTBURSTS </p><p>OF FRUSTRATION.  BUT THESE SHOW NO SIGN OF </p><p>TRANSFORMATION INTO SIGNIFICANT POLITICAL PROBLEMS FOR </p><p>THE REVOLUTION AS A WHOLE.  THERE IS NO ORGANIZED </p><p>OPPOSITION WITH STRENGTH CAPABLE OF THREATENING THE </p><p>REGIME\'S GRIP ON POWER.  THE DISPUTES MANIFEST IN THE </p><p>SPEECHES AND THE PRESS ARE WITHIN THE RANKS OF THE </p><p>REVOLUTION ITSELF.  THERE IS LITTLE HAPPENING IN  THE </p><p>STREETS AND IT IS NO THREAT.  APATHY AND WAR WEARINESS </p><p>PROVIDE A KIND OF SUPPORT THROUGH INERTIA.  MOST </p><p>IRANIANS WE SPEAK TO PREFER THIS REGIME -- IT IS THE </p><p>DEVIL THEY KNOW -- TO THE IDEOLOGY OF MOHAHEDIN AL </p><p>KHALQ OR A RETURN TO A DISCREDITED MONARCHY.  AND WHILE </p><p>TODAY\'S LEADERS FEUD OVER MANY ISSUES, THEY REMAIN </p><p>HIGHLY AWARE OF THEIR COLLECTIVE POSITION AND POWER. </p><p>THEY RARELY THREATEN EACH OTHER PERSONALLY.  THERE IS </p><p>NO APPARENT LESSENING OF THEIR ABILITY TO DEAL </p><p>RUTHLESSLY AND EFFECTIVELY WITH THEIR OPPONENTS OR </p><p>THOSE WHO QUESTION THEIR RIGHT TO RULE.  SO FAR, </p><p>DESPITE THEIR INEPTNESS IN MANY AREAS, THE REVOLUTION\'S </p><p>INNER CIRCLE LOOKS CAPABLE OF SURVIVING.  WALKER </p><p>UNQUOTE BAKER </p><p> </p><p>CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p></div>
