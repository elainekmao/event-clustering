BELLAVIA EXPLAINED THAT </p><p>THESE EXERCISES WERE NOT MILITARY IN NATURE, BUT WERE </p><p>DESIGNED TO COMBAT ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION FROM LIBYA TO </p><p>ITALY.  ACCORDING TO BELLAVIA, THE GOL DOES NOT </p><p>REQUIRE ENTRY VISAS FROM PEOPLE FROM SUB-SAHARAN </p><p>AFRICA.  AS A RESULT, LIBYA, A COUNTRY OF 6 MILLION </p><p>PEOPLE, NOW HAS 1.5 MILLION IMMIGRANTS IN ITS </p><p>TERRITORY (MAINLY FROM SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA AND THE </p><p>MAGHREB COUNTRIES).  THIS HAS CREATED A SERIOUS </p><p>PROBLEM FOR ITALY AS ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS FROM LIBYA USE </p><p>ITALY AS THEIR ENTRY INTO THE EU.  GIVEN THAT LIBYA </p><p>HAS LONG COASTS AND LITTLE CONTROL OVER THEM, </p><p>EXPLAINED BELLAVIA, ITALIAN NAVAL UNITS ARE HELPING </p><p>LIBYAN NAVAL UNITS COMBAT THE PROBLEM OF ILLEGAL </p><p>IMMIGRATION AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO AS LONG AS THIS </p><p>PROBLEM PERSISTS. </p><p>2.
