<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 KATHMANDU 001688 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>GENEVA FOR RMA </p><p>ROME FOR USMISSION </p><p>BRUSSELS FOR USMISSION </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/29/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREF, PREL, EAID, AORC, PHUM, NP, Bhutanese Refugees </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL AND BHUTAN TALK REFUGEES "INFORMALLY," BUT </p><p>PROCESS REMAINS STALLED </p><p> </p><p>REF: KATHMANDU 298 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Deputy Chief of Mission Robert K. Boggs, Reasons 1.5 (b) </p><p>, (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary.  Nepal and Bhutan have discussed the </p><p>Bhutanese refugee issue "informally," but a date has still </p><p>not been set for the next round of Ministerial-level talks on </p><p>the issue.  According to Nepal\'s Foreign Secretary, the </p><p>differences between the two sides have narrowed, and Bhutan </p><p>appeared flexible.  The EU recently sent a fact-finding </p><p>mission to the camps and subsequently wrote to the two </p><p>nations\' leaders asking that they speed the process of </p><p>verification and repatriation.  Also, Bhutan hosted visits by </p><p>two prominent Nepali politicians.  Many refugees have become </p><p>restless waiting for the process to resume, with some </p><p>pledging to "take action."  Without international attention, </p><p>progress on the Bhutanese refugee issue is unlikely.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Nepal: "Informal" Talks on Refugees Ongoing </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Nepal and Bhutan continue to discuss the Bhutanese </p><p>refugee issue "informally," Nepal\'s Foreign Secretary Madhu </p><p>Raman Acharya told DCM August 23.  To the outside world, the </p><p>status of the negotiations may "look like a deadlock," but </p><p>differences between the two nations have narrowed, and Bhutan </p><p>has shown some flexibility.  Acharya met Bhutan\'s Foreign </p><p>Secretary on the sidelines of the August 21-22 SAARC </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Ministerial in Kathmandu, and the discussion touched on the </p><p>refugee issue, Acharya related.  The Prime Minister also </p><p>raised the issue in a separate meeting with Bhutan\'s ForSec. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) According to Acharya, in these most recent discussions </p><p>Bhutan raised "legal problems," specifically, a national law </p><p>in Bhutan that would require returned refugees to reapply for </p><p>citizenship two years after their return to the country. </p><p>(Note:  Word has already spread through the camps that Bhutan </p><p>would insist that any returned refugee go through this </p><p>process to reacquire citizenship, and refugee activists have </p><p>expressed dismay over it in conversations with Poloff.  End </p><p>Note.) </p><p> </p><p>Still No Date for Ministerial </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The last formal round of bilateral talks occurred when </p><p>the two countries\' foreign secretaries met on November 6, </p><p>2001.  Since the beginning of the year, Foreign Ministry </p><p>officials in Kathmandu have told us repeatedly that the two </p><p>sides are "constantly" in touch, but that a date for another </p><p>round of talks has not yet been agreed on.  The GON has </p><p>become increasingly frustrated by its inability to secure a </p><p>date for the next round of talks with Bhutan.  Most recently, </p><p>Nepal has offered to convene a secretary-level meeting in the </p><p>absence of agreement on a date for a Ministerial. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Following the completion of verification interviews at </p><p>the Khudunabari refugee camp in December, 2001, efforts to </p><p>assign the refugees to four categories stalled due to </p><p>disagreement over the fate of those placed in the category of </p><p>"Bhutanese who left Bhutan voluntarily."  The next round of </p><p>formal Nepal-Bhutan talks is expected to focus on efforts to </p><p>"harmonize" positions on this issue.  In the meantime, there </p><p>are no plans to begin to interview residents of the other </p><p>camps, and the Nepali civil servants who were on the team </p><p>that conducted the interviews have been reassigned elsewhere. </p><p> A UNHCR Protection Officer commented to us that failing to </p><p>continue with verification interviews shows "a lack of </p><p>commitment" all around. </p><p> </p><p>EU Urges Both Sides to Hurry Up </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) EU diplomats recently called on MFA officials to </p><p>discuss the apparent standstill in negotiations.  The call </p><p>followed an EU "fact-finding mission" to the camps.  Upon the </p><p>mission\'s conclusion, the EU President sent letters to </p><p>Nepal\'s Prime Minister (in his role as Foreign Minister) and </p><p>Bhutan\'s Embassy in New Delhi.  The letters called on the two </p><p>governments to speed up the process and to implement, without </p><p>further delay, existing agreements on conducting verification </p><p>interviews.  The EU now considers that "the ball is in </p><p>Bhutan\'s court," a British Emboff told us after the letters </p><p>were sent. </p><p> </p><p>Positive Signs, but Suspicions Remain </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) A senior Nepalese diplomat who met with Bhutan\'s King </p><p>during a recent private visit to Thimpu told the Ambassador </p><p>that the meeting had made him optimistic that Bhutan was </p><p>serious about taking people back.  Meanwhile, Foreign </p><p>Ministry officials in Kathmandu have indicated to us, in </p><p>strict confidence, that Nepal would be willing to allow some </p><p>of the refugees to resettle within its borders (Reftel). </p><p>However, a Kathmandu-based Amcit businessman with ties to </p><p>Bhutan related to us his private conversation with the </p><p>Bhutanese Foreign Minister, who admitted that Bhutan was </p><p>stringing Nepal along, and hoped to maintain the diplomatic </p><p>advantage so as not to have to grant any concessions. </p><p> </p><p>Bhutan\'s Charm Offensive </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Although Bhutan\'s leaders claim to be too busy to meet </p><p>with their Nepalese counterparts, in recent months Thimpu has </p><p>hosted visits by two prominent opposition figures:  Madhav </p><p>Nepal, leader of Nepal\'s main opposition party, the Communist </p><p>Party of Nepal--United Marxist-Leninist (CPN-UML), and Chakra </p><p>Prasad Bastola, a former Foreign Minister and confidant of </p><p>former Prime Minister G.P. Koirala.  The Foreign Ministry </p><p>spokesperson told us that the government welcomed Bhutan\'s </p><p>invitations to Bastola and Nepal, insisting that the visits </p><p>could help move the process forward. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Madhav Nepal speculated that there could have been </p><p>several reasons why Bhutan invited him to visit.  In the main </p><p>he suspected that the Bhutanese did not like the ruling </p><p>Nepali Congress Party (NCP), and wanted to drive a wedge </p><p>between the Nepalese parties on this issue.  Madhav Nepal </p><p>added that in his audience with Bhutan\'s King, the monarch </p><p>had been very negative about UNHCR\'s role.  UNHCR\'s </p><p>statistics were incorrect, the King asserted, and many camp </p><p>residents were actually from India. </p><p> </p><p>Refugees Getting Restless </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) Over the past nine months, camp residents have </p><p>become restless awaiting the results of the verification </p><p>interviews.  A delegation elected to represent the </p><p>Khudunabari camp traveled to Kathmandu in June to circulate </p><p>copies of a petition addressed to Nepali and Bhutanese heads </p><p>of state.  The petition called for the two nations to declare </p><p>the results of the verification exercise, commence </p><p>verification interviews at the remaining camps, and begin </p><p>repatriating verified refugees to Bhutan. </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU) The delegation met with Poloff and also paid calls </p><p>on UNHCR and the British, Japanese and Australian embassies. </p><p>Ratan Gazmere, a Bhutanese refugee and activist recruited by </p><p>camp leaders to help with their campaign, accompanied the </p><p>delegation on its rounds.  He told Poloff that the refugees </p><p>were "very frustrated" with the delay.  At a camp meeting the </p><p>residents had made a collective decision that they "cannot </p><p>sit by any longer" and had to do something. </p><p> </p><p>12. (SBU) Gazmere pointed out that the camp population is </p><p>dynamic, and so much time has passed that many new families </p><p>have formed as a result of marriages, births and deaths.  For </p><p>that reason the data collected by the Joint Verification Team </p><p>(JVT) on the basis of family groupings becomes less valid </p><p>every day.  Before too long another round of verification </p><p>interviews will be required to bring the information up to </p><p>date, Gazmere insisted.  To force the Bhutanese to move the </p><p>process forward, Gazmere suggested that the GON unilaterally </p><p>announce the results of the verification interviews. </p><p>13. (C) In recent months refugee activists have been </p><p>publicizing studies purporting to prove that Bhutan has begun </p><p>a program to resettle the refugees\' lands in south Bhutan </p><p>with Drukpa ethnics from the north.  The release of one such </p><p>study, by the "Habitat International Coalition," was widely </p><p>covered in the press.  These reports have further inflamed </p><p>refugee sentiment.  One moderate refugee leader told Poloff </p><p>August 29 that the refugees planned to "take action" to bring </p><p>attention to their plight.  He assured us that these would be </p><p>peaceful. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) By stalling, both Bhutan and Nepal are looking to </p><p>maximize their own advantage.  Bhutan hopes to exclude from </p><p>repatriation the category of "Bhutanese who left Bhutan </p><p>voluntarily," while Nepal wishes to rectify the mistake it </p><p>made when it agreed to Bhutan\'s proposal establishing four </p><p>separate categories.  Although the Nepalis are hesitant to </p><p>declare the dialogue a "deadlock," the fact that the two </p><p>sides have not held formal talks on the issue in nine months </p><p>means that no progress is being made.  Meanwhile, the </p><p>refugees are getting restless.  The camps have so far been </p><p>peaceful, but the combination of frustration and restlessness </p><p>could lead to discontent, violence, or worse--the creation of </p><p>fertile recruitment grounds for the Maoists and other </p><p>militants.  The USG and other donors have an interest in </p><p>seeing the refugee crisis resolved quickly.  But without </p><p>prolonged and consistent attention from the international </p><p>community, the two nations are unlikely to get there on their </p><p>own. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
