<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 ADANA 0004 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINS, PGOV, PHUM, TU, IZ, Press Summaries, ADANA </p><p>SUBJECT:  SOUTHEAST TURKEY PRESS SUMMARY, </p><p>JANUARY 6-7, 2003 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  This is the Southeastern Turkey press summary </p><p>for January 6-7, 2003.  Please note that Turkish </p><p>press reports often contain errors or </p><p>exaggerations; AmConsulate Adana does not vouch for </p><p>the accuracy of the reports summarized here. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>POLITICS, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  ANTI-WAR STATEMENTS </p><p>Evrensel(01/06) reported that the Kahramanmaras </p><p>chapter of the State Employees\' Union Confederation </p><p>(KESK) issued an anti-war press release calling for </p><p>opposition to war.  Akif Ekici of the Gaziantep </p><p>Organized Industrial Zone said a new intervention </p><p>in Iraq would result in such negative effects as </p><p>market losses and decreases in employment and </p><p>production.  Evrensel (01/07) quoted State </p><p>Employees\' Union Confederation (KESK) Mersin </p><p>Chapters Platform Term Spokesperson Recep Kara as </p><p>voicing opposition to involvement in a war that had </p><p>nothing to do with Turkish people.  The presidents </p><p>of the Mersin Genel-Is labor union and Egitim-Sen </p><p>teachers union opposed war, as it would bring </p><p>nothing but suffering and tears.  The Egitim-Sen </p><p>secretary general called on laborers for active </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>opposition to war.  The Turkish Union of Architects </p><p>and Engineers Chambers (TMMOB) Van Provincial </p><p>Coordination Council President indicated a possible </p><p>war in Iraq would bring destruction to all the </p><p>people in the Middle East. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  SIRNAK RESIDENTS STOCKPILING FLOUR </p><p>(Sabah)  Residents of Sirnak\'s Silopi township have </p><p>been rushing to flourmills in an effort to </p><p>stockpile sacks of flour prior to the possible U.S. </p><p>operation against Iraq.  Six flourmills in the </p><p>province are not able to meet the demand, while </p><p>eight trailer trucks affiliated with the Turkish </p><p>Red Crescent Society are reported to have unloaded </p><p>materials in Silopi.  "Although we have a daily </p><p>capacity of 125-175 sacks, we cannot keep up with </p><p>the demand," said a local miller.  Evrensel (01/07) </p><p>quoted Silopi merchants as wanting "investments, </p><p>not war" in the region. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  SIRNAK RESIDENTS CONCERNED OVER LANDMINES AND </p><p>WAR </p><p>(Cumhuriyet)  Landmines planted as part of the </p><p>fight against the PKK in Silopi\'s (Sirnak) Ova </p><p>village, which is on the Iraqi border, killed three </p><p>people and damaged four tractors in 2001.  In the </p><p>same year, other ammunition such as mortar shells </p><p>and hand grenades also caused the death of 19 </p><p>people and the injury of 34 others in the region. </p><p>War preparations along the Iraqi border have led to </p><p>increased concerns on the part of Southeastern </p><p>people that they might return to dark days again. </p><p>Evrensel reported a four-fold increase in rental </p><p>prices as a result of reports stating that U.S. </p><p>soldiers would come to the district. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  SYRIA HANDS OVER PKK MEMBER </p><p>(Cumhuriyet/Turkiye/Evrensel)  Syria handed over to </p><p>Turkey a KADEK (PKK) member determined to have </p><p>participated in armed activities in rural Mardin on </p><p>behalf of KADEK.  Also, Mardin police arrested four </p><p>people who had come from Sanliurfa to join KADEK. </p><p>The four arrestees reportedly admitted having </p><p>traveled to join KADEK. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  "TRICKY TRIAL FOR USE OF KURDISH" </p><p>(Evrensel)  Attorney Sedat Yurttas of the </p><p>Diyarbakir Bar Association claimed the State was </p><p>trickily opening cases for "membership in an </p><p>illegal organization (i.e., KADEK/PKK)" or </p><p>"assisting and abetting an illegal organization </p><p>(KADEK)" instead of directly opening cases against </p><p>the use of Kurdish language and culture.  Attorneys </p><p>alleged such cases de facto violated EU </p><p>Harmonization Laws. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  MALATYA SUPPORT FOR DIYARBAKIR PETITION DRIVE </p><p>(Evrensel)  Malatya\'s Inonu University students </p><p>issued a January 5 press release in front of the </p><p>province\'s post office in support of the "I Want My </p><p>University Initiative" campaign launched by Dicle </p><p>University (Diyarbakir) students.  The students </p><p>called for reforming the structure of the Higher </p><p>Education Council (YOK), which they characterized </p><p>as a product of the "September 12" military regime </p><p>and an obstacle to science and free thought in </p><p>universities.  They carried "No to YOK," "Free of </p><p>charge, Scientific and Democratic Education," </p><p>"Budget to Education, Not War" and "No to YOK Bill" </p><p>banners and shouted anti-YOK slogans. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ECONOMIC AND AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENTS </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  DELAY IN RE-OPENING OF ADANA AIRPORT DRAWS </p><p>CRITICISM </p><p>(Bolge)  Residents of Adana criticized a delay in </p><p>completion of the repair project at the Adana </p><p>Airport, which was closed by the State Airports </p><p>Administration (DHMI) to flights on November 4. </p><p>Residents described the airport\'s closure for </p><p>repair during winter conditions as "an example of </p><p>irresponsibility."  DHMI officials had previously </p><p>announced they would try to complete the repair </p><p>project and re-open the airport by mid-January. </p><p>Muslim pilgrim candidates, however, complained they </p><p>were not being given a definite date on which they </p><p>could fly to Saudi Arabia, as it is not known when </p><p>the airport would resume operation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  EIGHTY-NINE PER CENT OF PLOTS AT ADANA\'S OIZ </p><p>SOLD </p><p>(Bolge)  Umit Ozgumus, President of the Adana </p><p>Chamber of Industry and Vice President of the Adana </p><p>Haci Sabanci Organized Industrial Zone, said that </p><p>89% (7,075,858 square meters) of the zone\'s plots </p><p>had been sold.  The zone is reported to be one of </p><p>Turkey\'s largest organized industrial zones. </p><p>Ozgumus indicated that 167 firms were currently </p><p>operational in the zone, while he expects </p><p>construction projects for another 85 firms to be </p><p>completed soon.  Another 109 firms are at the </p><p>project stage.  The zone houses 24 different </p><p>sectors, providing employment for 13,000 people. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  MORE TOURISTS VISIT GAZIANTEP MUSEUMS IN 2002 </p><p>(Milli Gazete/Bolge)  The number of domestic and </p><p>foreign tourists visiting Gaziantep museums </p><p>increased 141.7% in 2002, rising to 45,933 people, </p><p>compared to 19,000 visitors in 2001.  The increase </p><p>was attributed to the display in these museums of </p><p>mythological mosaics unearthed during excavations </p><p>in the ancient city of Zeugma, which was partly </p><p>submerged by water from Sanliurfa\'s Birecik Dam. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  TRUCKER PROTEST ENDS </p><p>(Turkiye/Milli Gazete/Evrensel)  A demonstration </p><p>staged by a group of truckers carrying fuel oil </p><p>from (northern) Iraq to the Turkish Petroleum </p><p>International Corporation (TPIC) Batman </p><p>Installations in protest of non-receipt of money </p><p>after waiting over three days in lines in order to </p><p>unload their cargoes ended on January 4.  Following </p><p>an agreement between the truckers and the </p><p>contracting firm that foresees that truckers will </p><p>receive a payment of TL 15 million (approx. USD 9) </p><p>per day after a three-day waiting period, truckers </p><p>began to unload their cargoes.  Currently, 1,700 </p><p>truckers are reported to be waiting in line in </p><p>front of the TPIC Batman Installations.  Iskender </p><p>Iskenderoglu of the contracting firm said that </p><p>access from the Habur (Sirnak) border gate had been </p><p>suspended until the lines disappear. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  SOUTHEASTERN EXPORTS DOWN OVER 8% IN THE FIRST </p><p>11 MONTHS </p><p>(Bolge)  According to the Southeastern Anatolia </p><p>Exporters\' Union, agricultural, animal-based, and </p><p>industrial product exports from the Southeastern </p><p>Anatolia Project (GAP) region to 118 countries and </p><p>eleven free zones in Turkey decreased 8.3% in </p><p>January-November 2002, falling to USD 542.8 million </p><p>from USD 591.4 million for the same period in 2001. </p><p>In the same period, USD 388,038 million of textile, </p><p>USD 61.5 million of grain, beans and seed products, </p><p>USD 60.3 million dried fruits, USD 19.8 million of </p><p>industrial products and USD 13.2 million of animals </p><p>and animal-based products were exported from the </p><p>region.  Eighty-two per cent of the exports were </p><p>from Gaziantep, with main export items being </p><p>machine-made carpets, synthetic yarns and synthetic </p><p>textiles.  Major customers included Italy, Germany </p><p>and Saudi Arabia. </p><p>HOLTZ </p><p></p></div>
