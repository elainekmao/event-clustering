<p>S E C R E T ABU DHABI 006422 </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARP AND SA/PAB </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/31/11 </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, PTER, AF, PK, TC </p><p>SUBJECT:  AFGHANISTAN\'S FUTURE - NEXT STEPS </p><p> </p><p>REF:  STATE 192153 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) CLASSIFIED BY DCM GORDON R. OLSON, FOR </p><p>REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) POLOFF REVIEWED REFTEL POINTS ON THE </p><p>FUTURE OF AFGHANISTAN WITH MUHAMMAD ABDUL RAHIM </p><p>ABDUL JALIL, MFA DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF AMERICAN </p><p>AND EUROPEAN AFFAIRS ON NOVEMBER 7.  SHE HANDED </p><p>OVER A COPY OF THE PRESIDENT\'S SPEECH TO THE </p><p>WARSAW CONFERENCE ON COMBATING TERRORISM. </p><p>ABDUL JALIL SAID HE HAD HEARD EXCERPTS OF THE </p><p>SPEECH ON AL-JAZEERA AND NOTED THAT THE </p><p>PRESIDENT HAD DELIVERED A FORCEFUL AND WELCOME </p><p>MESSAGE.  ABDUL JALIL CONDEMNED THE 9/11 </p><p>ATTACKS AND REITERATED THE UAE\'S STRONG </p><p>COMMITMENT TO THE ANTI-TERROR COALITION. </p><p>RECALLING THAT THE UAE HAD ITSELF BEEN A TARGET </p><p>OF TERRORIST ATTACKS IN THE 1970\'S AND 1980\'S </p><p>(THE FOREIGN MINISTER WAS ASSASSINATED AND </p><p>SEVERAL UAE DIPLOMATS ABROAD WERE TARGETED BY </p><p>ABU NIDAL), ABDUL JALIL DECLARED THAT WE NEEDED </p><p>TO STAND TOGETHER AGAINST THIS NEW THREAT.  UBL </p><p>DID NOT SPEAK FOR THE MUSLIM PEOPLE, HE STATED, </p><p>MOST OF WHOM JUST WANT TO LIVE IN PEACE. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) NOTING USG HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE TO </p><p>THE AFGHAN PEOPLE, POLOFF LAUDED THE UAE\'S OWN </p><p>SUBSTANTIAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM.  SHE SAID THE </p><p>U.S. ANTICIPATED THAT A HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE </p><p>DONORS CONFERENCE WOULD BE HELD AND ENCOURAGED </p><p>UAE PARTICIPATION. GIVEN THE FACT THAT THE UAE </p><p>HAS HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE TEAMS ON THE GROUND </p><p>IN AFGHANISTAN -- WORKING THROUGH THE UAE RED </p><p>CRESCENT SOCIETY -- THE DONORS\' CONFERENCE </p><p>WOULD PROVIDE AN EXCELLENT OPPORTUNITY FOR THE </p><p>EMIRATIS TO SHARE THEIR KNOWLEDGE AND COMBINE </p><p>THEIR EFFORTS WITH OTHERS IN THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>COMMUNITY.  ABDUL JALIL AGREED THAT THE UAE </p><p>NEEDED TO BE PART OF ANY DONORS CONFERENCE AND </p><p>EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT CONDITIONS ON THE </p><p>GROUND IN AFGHANISTAN, PARTICULARLY IN ADVANCE </p><p>OF THE HARSH WINTER. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) TURNING TO AFGHANISTAN\'S FUTURE, POLOFF </p><p>NOTED THE DIFFICULTY OF FORGING A COALITION </p><p>AMONG AFGHANISTAN\'S DIVERSE ETHNIC GROUPS. </p><p>NEVERTHELESS, WE BELIEVED THAT A BROAD-BASED </p><p>GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO BE ESTABLISHED AND THAT, AT </p><p>ALL COSTS, WE SHOULD AVOID THE CREATION OF A </p><p>POWER VACUUM.  TO THIS END, WE FULLY ENDORSED </p><p>THE EFFORTS OF UN SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE </p><p>BRAHIMI.  ABDUL JALIL, WHO SERVED UNTIL AUGUST </p><p>AS THE UAE\'S DCM IN TEHRAN, WONDERED ABOUT </p><p>IRANIAN DESIGNS AND HOPED THAT THE SIX PLUS TWO </p><p>MEETING IN NEW YORK WOULD BEAR FRUIT.  THE </p><p>PASHTUNS -- WHO HE ESTIMATED COMPRISE 51% OF </p><p>THE AFGHAN POPULATION -- WILL NEED TO PLAY A </p><p>MAJOR ROLE IN ANY FUTURE GOVERNMENT, ABDUL </p><p>JALIL SURMISED. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) PESHAWAR MINIMIZE CONSIDERED. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
