AT THE </p><p>INSTITUTE OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS (IIR) (ROUGHLY </p><p>EQUIVALENT TO THE DEPARTMENT\'S NFTAC), SENIOR RESEARCHER </p><p>PHAN NGHO UYEN CALLED VIETNAM\'S RELATIONS WITH THE EU AND </p><p>WITH THE INDIVIDUAL MEMBER STATES "VERY GOOD," WHILE </p><p>ADMITTING THEY WERE "PERHAPS NOT AS DEVELOPED AS THE </p><p>ECONOMIC RELATIONS." </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS FOCUS </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  DESPITE THE GENERALLY POSITIVE TREND IN THE EU- </p><p>VIETNAM RELATIONSHIP, HUMAN RIGHTS REMAIN A KEY ISSUE OF </p><p>CONCERN TO THE EU.  THE MFA\'S ANH NOTED THAT "WE TALK ABOUT </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS WHEN THE EU WANTS TO," ADDING THAT THE "TWO </p><p>SIDES SHOULD BE MORE UNDERSTANDING OF EACH OTHER."  SHE </p><p>ADDED THAT THE GVN IS SOMETIMES "UPSET" OVER HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>ISSUES RAISED BY EUROPEAN PARLIAMENTARY VISITS (ONE IS </p><p>ONGOING SEPTEMBER 9-14), SINCE SOME EU PARLIAMENTARIANS "DO </p><p>NOT UNDERSTAND THE HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION IN VIETNAM AND </p><p>MAKE INACCURATE STATEMENTS." </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) TO COUNTER WHAT ANH TERMED "DISTORTION" FROM EU </p><p>PARLIAMENTARIANS, THE MFA ORGANIZED A TRIP TO THE CENTRAL </p><p>HIGHLANDS IN MARCH 2002 TO PROVIDE AN "ACCURATE PICTURE" OF </p><p>THE HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION IN THAT AREA.  ONE EU PARTICIPANT </p><p>SUBSEQUENTLY COMPLAINED PRIVATELY TO US THAT THE TRIP HAD </p><p>BEEN "CAREFULLY MANAGED" BY THE GVN, LEAVING "ALMOST NO" </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02209  02 OF 04  100948Z </p><p>INTERACTION BETWEEN THE EU REPRESENTATIVES AND THE LOCAL </p><p>POPULATION.  ANOTHER PARTICIPANT COMPLAINED THAT THE TRIP </p><p>HAD TAKEN A "LONG TIME" TO GET ORGANIZED.  THE DIPLOMATS </p><p>WERE ACCOMPANIED BY A LARGE GROUP OF ESCORTS INCLUDING MANY </p><p>"REPORTERS," HE ADDED; LOCAL PEOPLE WERE PROBABLY </p><p>INTIMIDATED BY THE ESCORT, HE LAMENTED. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU)  THE EU\'S CALDARONE INSISTED THAT THE EU CONTINUES </p><p>"TO PUSH THE GVN ON HUMAN RIGHTS," BUT "PERHAPS NOT AS </p><p>STRONGLY AS THE U.S."  HE POINTED TO THE EU\'S VIETNAM FIVE- </p><p>YEAR COUNTRY STRATEGY, RELEASED IN MAY 2002, WHICH LISTS </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS AS ONE OF THE "CROSS-CUTTING THEMES" AND AS AN </p><p>"INTEGRAL PART" OF THE EU\'S ASSISTANCE.  WITH "LESS </p><p>HISTORICAL BAGGAGE" THAN THE U.S., THE EU PROBABLY DOES NOT </p><p>FIND AS MUCH HOSTILITY TOWARDS HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES AS DOES </p><p>THE U.S., HE OPINED. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U)  AT THE EU HEADQUARTERS LEVEL, EU COMMISSIONER FOR </p><p>EXTERNAL RELATIONS CHRIS PATTEN EXPRESSED "CONCERN" ABOUT </p><p>THE HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION IN VIETNAM IN JULY 2001.  THE EU </p><p>FOLLOWED WITH A STRONGER STATEMENT AT THE NOVEMBER JOINT </p><p>COMMISSION MEETING, EXPLICITLY CITING PROBLEMS WITH FREEDOM </p><p>OF OPINION AND RELIGION, THE SITUATION OF ETHNIC MINORITIES, </p><p>AND CONTINUED APPLICATION OF THE DEATH PENALTY.  THE GVN </p><p>RESPONDED FORCEFULLY TO THIS STATEMENT, PUBLICLY CLAIMING IT </p><p>DID "NOT REFLECT REALITY."  MORE RECENTLY, THE MAY STRATEGY </p><p>PAPER NOTED THAT THE GVN\'S PROGRESS IN HUMAN RIGHTS HAS BEEN </p><p>"LIMITED" AND THAT "NUMEROUS INSTITUTIONS OUTSIDE VIETNAM, </p><p>INCLUDING THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT, HAVE CRITICIZED THE GVN\'S </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS RECORD, PARTICULARLY CONCERNING THE DETENTION </p><p>AND IMPRISONMENT OF RELIGIOUS LEADERS. . ." </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02209  02 OF 04  100948Z </p><p> </p><p>11.  (SBU)  EUROPEAN EMBOFFS IN HANOI VARIOUSLY NOTED THE </p><p>IMPORTANCE THEIR INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES PLACE ON HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>PROBLEMS IN VIETNAM.  MIKAEL WINTHER, DANISH EMBASSY </p><p>COUNSELOR, SAID THAT HIS GOVERNMENT IS A "STRONG ADVOCATE" </p><p>OF HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES AND "FULLY SUPPORTS" THE EU\'S </p><p>DIALOGUE WITH THE GVN.  THE NETHERLANDS\' POLITICAL COUNSELOR </p><p>MICHIEL VAN DER VEN SAID HIS GOVERNMENT "STRONGLY SUPPORTS" </p><p>THE EU\'S DIALOGUE AND ALSO BRINGS UP HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES </p><p>BILATERALLY WITH THE GVN.  SWEDISH EMBASSY COUNSELOR FOR </p><p>DEVELOPMENT COOPERATION PER LUNDELL SAID THAT HIS EMBASSY </p><p>DISCUSSES HUMAN RIGHTS "FORCEFULLY" WITH VIETNAM.  HE ALSO </p><p>NOTED SWEDEN\'S "CONTINUED" SUPPORT FOR THE EU HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>DIALOGUE. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE:  EU\'S HELP APPRECIATED </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>12.
