A STATE 55166 </p><p>     B. B 99 THE HAGUE 2224 </p><p>     C. 99 THE HAGUE 1324 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) Begin Summary:  As a follow-up to Ambassador </p><p>Scheffer\'s 28 March letter to the Registrar of the </p><p>International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia </p><p>(ICTY) regarding possible relocation of Tribunal witnesses to </p><p>the United States (Ref A), Embassy legaloffs had discussions </p><p>with representatives from the ICTY Registry and the Victim </p><p>Witness Unit (VWU).  Although certain aspects of the USG </p><p>proposal were very well-received, ICTY representatives were </p><p>generally disappointed by the overall approach being </p><p>suggested.  The Acting Head of the VWU explained that the </p><p>ICTY only proposes witnesses for relocation if their lives </p><p>are at serious risk.  Consequently, when a request for </p><p>relocation is made it has to be acted upon quickly.  The </p><p>ICTY\'s overriding interest is in having some commitment from </p><p>the USG to a quick, flexible procedure that would ensure a </p><p>fast-track process through the normal INS procedures.  ICTY </p><p>representatives pressed hard on whether it might be possible </p><p>to achieve some kind of break-through on expedited processing </p><p>of requests.  Specific comments and requests for additional </p><p>information/clarification of the proposed approach based on </p><p>existing authorities are provided below.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) In discussions with Embassy legaloffs regarding the </p><p>possibility of concluding an agreement or arrangement with </p><p>the USG for relocation of witnesses to the United States, </p><p>ICTY representatives were candid about their disappointment </p><p>that the 28 March proposal did not provide for a special </p><p>relocation procedure, nor a commitment to expedite the </p><p>existing INS process.  Underscoring the fact that the VWU </p><p>only requests relocation for witnesses whose lives are at </p><p>serious risk because of their testimonies, the ICTY reps </p><p>noted that they well understand that a country making a </p><p>commitment to relocate witnesses must operate within the </p><p>provisions of its own laws.  In that regard, they pointed out </p><p>that other governments also have relied upon existing </p><p>domestic authorities in defining the scope of benefits for </p><p>relocated witnesses.  Unlike the USG proposal, however, those </p><p>other governments have committed themselves to special </p><p>fast-track procedures for ICTY witnesses.  In the case of </p><p>Canada, for example, provisions are made for witnesses who </p><p>need to be relocated on an urgent basis.  Other agreements </p><p>provide for the transfer to happen within two months, in the </p><p>event of urgent cases, even sooner.  The ICTY representatives </p><p>were keen to know whether it might be possible to achieve </p><p>some kind of break-through on expedited processing of </p><p>requests. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) Benefits Package:  The ICTY representatives indicated </p><p>that the benefits package for relocated witnesses as </p><p>described in Ambassador Scheffer\'s letter appeared to be very </p><p>good.  They requested certain details on the various </p><p>benefits.  In particular, the VWU would like to know what </p><p>benefits witnesses would be entitled to after the initial </p><p>eight months.  In addition, they requested information on </p><p>whether the witnesses would be entitled to housing, </p><p>education, and travel documents to enable the witnesses to </p><p>travel to and from the United States.  Finally, they raised </p><p>the need to relocate close family members (either together </p><p>with the witness or at a later stage).  In this regard they </p><p>noted that the war in the former Yugoslavia had torn apart </p><p>many families, and made many children orphans.  Such children </p><p>are often in the custody of distant relatives or even former </p><p>neighbors.  If possible, the VWU would like to ensure that </p><p>such children or relatives qualify as close family members </p><p>for relocation purposes. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) Requirement for Transcript of Witness\'s Testimony: </p><p>The 28 March letter indicated that in order for the INS to </p><p>assess whether the "persecutor bar" would apply in an </p><p>individual case, the INS would require a transcript of the </p><p>testimony of the witness.  In response to this requirement, </p><p>the VWU raised several concerns.  First, the ICTY </p><p>representatives pointed out that in some cases a witness may </p><p>need to be relocated before any appearance in court.  In such </p><p>cases, no transcript would exist.  Second, they reiterated </p><p>their earlier point that the ICTY only proposes relocation </p><p>for witnesses whose lives are at risk due to the contents of </p><p>their testimonies.  Given the sensitivity of such </p><p>testimonies, the Judges will normally grant protective </p><p>measures for these witnesses and proceed in closed session. </p><p>Thus, the transcripts of the proposed witnesses\' testimonies </p><p>will normally be confidential (i.e., sealed by the Court). </p><p>Although some witnesses proposed for relocation may testify </p><p>in open session under a pseudonym, the transcripts of such </p><p>sessions are also not available for release. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) Instead of relying on a transcript of a witness\'s </p><p>testimony, the VWU asked whether the INS would accept a </p><p>statement from the ICTY that would contain information on the </p><p>testimony, and explain why the testimony put the witness\'s </p><p>life at risk.  The VWU indicated that such a statement would </p><p>have to be treated as classified by the INS or other </p><p>authorities.  In addition, the VWU representatives informed </p><p>Embassy legaloffs that for all relocation requests, the </p><p>Registrar receives a certification from the Office of the </p><p>Prosecutor (OTP) that the witness in question is not a </p><p>suspect or under investigation for any crime over which the </p><p>ICTY has jurisdiction.  The certification from the OTP also </p><p>typically states that, as far as the Prosecutor is aware, the </p><p>witness has not committed any other crimes. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) After Relocation:  Assuming witnesses are relocated </p><p>to the United States pursuant to a request from the ICTY, the </p><p>ICTY would like to include a provision for the exchange of </p><p>information so the ICTY can be kept informed of the witness\'s </p><p>status once settled in the United States.  For example, ICTY </p><p>representatives would need to know about any threats that </p><p>arise or any other problems that develop in relation to the </p><p>witness\'s testimony.  Similarly, they would need to know if a </p><p>witness died or his/her whereabouts became unknown. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) In a related vein, the ICTY representatives indicated </p><p>that they would like to include a provision in a relocation </p><p>agreement or arrangement that in the (unlikely) event of </p><p>extradition, the witness or any member of the relocated </p><p>family should not be returned to the territory of the former </p><p>Yugoslavia without the written consent of both the witness </p><p>and the ICTY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) Fingerprinting:  Regarding the request for all </p><p>witnesses proposed for relocation to be fingerprinted, the </p><p>ICTY indicated that it is not technically equipped to provide </p><p>fully legible fingerprint cards. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) Comment:  Embassy notes that USG and ICTY reps have </p><p>been in engaged in efforts  to negotiate a formal arrangement </p><p>for the relocation of witnesses since September 1998. </p><p>Despite support for this effort from Executive and </p><p>Legislative branch officials, nothing concrete has been </p><p>achieved.  Embassy therefore recommends that if there is a </p><p>consensus within the USG to conclude an agreement with the </p><p>ICTY on this issue, face to face negotiations between ICTY </p><p>reps and representatives from all relevant agencies (e.g., </p><p>INS/DOJ/DOS) officials should be scheulded either in The </p><p>Hague or in Washington in the near future.  Alternatively, if </p><p>no consensus to accommodate the ICTY\'s request for an </p><p>expedited process exists, we should inform the ICTY that we </p><p>are unable to meet its request at this time, but will </p><p>continue to consider requests on an ad hoc basis under </p><p>existing authorities.  End Comment. </p><p>FENDRICK </p><p></p></div>
