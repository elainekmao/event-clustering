<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 KATHMANDU 001496 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR SA/INS AND SA/RA </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/GURNEY </p><p>NSC FOR MILLARD </p><p>PLEASE PASS TO USAID/ANE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/30/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, PINS, CASC, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL:  MAOISTS ATTACK SECURITY FORCES; PRESSURING </p><p>THE PENDING PEACE TALKS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. A. KATHMANDU 1431 </p><p>     B. B. KATHMANDU 1423 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM Robert K. Boggs for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p>======== </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) Since their July 31 commitment to a third round of </p><p>peace talks (ref A), the Maoists have increased activities in </p><p>violation of the cease-fire code of conduct resulting in the </p><p>deaths of 8 security personnel and one Maoist.  Maoist </p><p>violations could be a unilateral attempt to restrict the army </p><p>to within 5 kilometers of their barracks.  Coming on the </p><p>heels of threats to American development projects in three </p><p>districts north of Kathmandu (ref B), on August 2, Maoists </p><p>extorted money from American student volunteers and on August </p><p>4 accused USAID of implementing projects in these districts </p><p>designed to proselytize and convert Nepali Hindus to </p><p>Christianity.  Maoist aggressiveness is not limited to the </p><p>U.S., the Australian Embassy reported two recent incidents </p><p>against their projects.  Post will continue to confer with </p><p>non-governmental organizations and diplomatic missions to get </p><p>a better understanding of the scope and depth of recent </p><p>Maoist threats.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Maoist Code of Conduct Violations </p><p>================================== </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) Since their July 31 announcement committing them to a </p><p>third round of peace talks (ref A), the Maoists have </p><p>increased the pace of their violations of the agreed </p><p>code-of-conduct.  In nine days, the press has reported that </p><p>Maoists have ambushed government security patrols, stolen </p><p>government funds for the poor, executed a police officer, and </p><p>abducted both security personnel and civilians.  The reported </p><p>incidents are outlined below: </p><p> </p><p>-- July 31, Maoists ambushed an army unit en route to inspect </p><p>a telecommunications repeater just outside Sindhuli District </p><p>headquarters, 70 kilometers east of Kathmandu.  The Maoists </p><p>hung two soldiers, while three were able to escape, one with </p><p>minor injuries. </p><p> </p><p>-- August 1, Maoists shot a police officer in Bhairahawa, a </p><p>border town in south-central Nepal, while he was inspecting </p><p>damage caused by flooding. </p><p> </p><p>-- August 2, five students abducted five months ago from </p><p>their schools in Khotang District, in eastern Nepal, escaped </p><p>from a Maoist training camp. </p><p> </p><p>-- August 3, Maoists and an army patrol reportedly exchanged </p><p>fire in Dailekh District, in Nepal\'s mid-west, killing one </p><p>Maoist guerrilla and injuring six others.  The army took nine </p><p>into custody and confiscated improvised explosives, bullets, </p><p>and political documents. </p><p> </p><p>-- August 3, Maoists abducted seven civilians cutting timber </p><p>in Udaypur District in Nepal\'s eastern hills. </p><p> </p><p>-- August 3, Maoist cadres in Taplejung, in Nepal\'s far-east, </p><p>took over USD 300 from a village secretary intended for </p><p>distribution to the elderly and widows. </p><p> </p><p>-- August 4, insurgents abducted a police officer and his </p><p>brother returning from a rural post in Ramechap, a district </p><p>60 kilometers east of Kathmandu.  The brother was released </p><p>after a severe beating. </p><p> </p><p>-- August 5, the press reported a Maoist ambush of a combined </p><p>army and police patrol in Panchthar District in Nepal\'s </p><p>far-east.  The attack killed five and injured 28 others. </p><p> </p><p>-- August 5, Maoists reportedly attacked security forces on </p><p>patrol in Dailekh District in Nepal\'s mid-west.  No casualty </p><p>figures were provided; however, Maoists were quoted with </p><p>saying that their cadres have been ordered to attack </p><p>government forces that move outside a 5-kilometer radius of </p><p>their barracks.  (Note:  The Maoist negotiators claim, and </p><p>the government disputes, that the 5-kilometer restriction was </p><p>agreed to at the second round of peace talks.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Threats to Americans </p><p>===================== </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) On August 2, a group of American Christian students </p><p>volunteering with Global Roots of Boston were approached by a </p><p>group of Maoists in Nuwakot District immediately north of </p><p>Kathmandu.  The Maoists lectured the group for over an hour </p><p>with a speech that included anti-American and anti-Bush </p><p>sentiments.  The Maoists stated that they would not hold </p><p>American policies against the students, but the Maoists </p><p>demanded each of the students to pay a USD 5 fee (which they </p><p>did).  Carole Lester, the group\'s coordinator, quoted the </p><p>Maoists as saying, "This is our area.  We are in control.  If </p><p>you were not students, we would have charged you USD 50 per </p><p>person.  If you had been affiliated with an NGO </p><p>(non-governmental organization), you would have been charged </p><p>50 percent of the development costs."  The students were </p><p>building an extension to a village school with USD 5,000 </p><p>raised in the U.S.  Lester reported that after this </p><p>encounter, the group pulled out of the project and left </p><p>Nuwakot the next morning.  (Note:  The RSO had briefed the </p><p>coordinator before they departed for Nuwakot, urging them to </p><p>reconsider.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) The local press reported that at a press conference </p><p>on August 5, a Maoist leader of the Rasuwa, Nuwakot, and </p><p>Sindhupalchok Districts accused USAID of funding the </p><p>construction of four churches in the three districts in order </p><p>to proselytize.  He alleged that USAID has attracted more </p><p>than five thousand Hindus to Christianity.  (Note: </p><p>Prosylitizing is prohibited by Nepali law, although people </p><p>may voluntarily pursue a change in faith.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p>Australian-affiliated Projects Harassed </p><p>========================================= </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Maoist aggressiveness is not limited to the U.S. </p><p>For example, the Australian Embassy reported to the DCM two </p><p>recent Maoist threats to Australian-affiliated projects.  In </p><p>Kavre District, adjacent to Kathmandu to the east, an </p><p>Australian project vehicle was stopped by gun and grenade </p><p>toting Maoists who demanded a ride; against security </p><p>guidelines, the driver did so.  This event has put at risk </p><p>Australia\'s 20 year-old commercial forestry projects in Kavre </p><p>and Sindhupalchok (northeast of Kathmandu) Districts. </p><p>Australian project vehicles will no longer be allowed to </p><p>travel through these districts, and all project management </p><p>will be confined to Kathmandu.  The Australian Embassy will </p><p>reassess the security conditions in a couple of weeks and </p><p>adjust or cancel the program as necessary. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) In Rasuwa District, a district north of Kathmandu </p><p>on the Chinese border, the Australian Embassy reported that </p><p>an Australian who heads a Seventh-Day Adventist NGO has </p><p>negotiated repeatedly with Maoist representatives to avoid </p><p>paying extortion.  The Australian has had to travel to the </p><p>district on five occasions to participate in these </p><p>discussions, with one of the sessions lasting five hours.  To </p><p>date, the group has reportedly avoided paying the Maoists. </p><p>However, in the last session the Maoists stated that if the </p><p>effort had been affiliated with the U.S., they would not have </p><p>entertained negotiations and would have just shutdown the </p><p>project.  In addition to these two incidents, the Australian </p><p>Embassy reported that the Maoist extortion has become more </p><p>aggressive in both Kavre and Sindhupalchok Districts. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>======== </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Maoist Violations:  If Maoist statements that they </p><p>are unilaterally enforcing the supposed 5-kilometer </p><p>restriction are true, Post expects there will be more attacks </p><p>in coming days.  The Maoists\' rampant violations of the </p><p>code-of-conduct are not matched by the government, which has </p><p>refrained from retaliating against Maoist violations for fear </p><p>of providing the Maoists with a pretext for breaking the </p><p>cease-fire.  The heightened levels of violence appear to be a </p><p>Maoist tactic to pressure the government to concede to the </p><p>5-kilometer restriction on the movement of security forces in </p><p>the upcoming peace talks.  In view of previous government </p><p>statements on this issue (ref B), it is unlikely the </p><p>government will agree to this restriction. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) Maoist Threats to Americans:  The threats to Global </p><p>Roots volunteers confirms reports of Maoist threats to </p><p>American-associated groups in Nuwakot District (ref B).  The </p><p>alleged demand for a 50 percent cut of NGO project funds is a </p><p>new element that, if adhered to on a national scale, will </p><p>certainly restrict the efforts of USG development programs </p><p>and the work of many privately-funded American organizations. </p><p> Post will propose language for an amended Public </p><p>Announcement after conferring with USAID development partners </p><p>and other diplomatic missions regarding their recent </p><p>experiences with the Maoists.  End Comment. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
