HARARE 1381 </p><p>     B. HARARE 863 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Officer Audu Besmer for reasons 1.5 b/d </p><p> </p><p>Summary: </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) On July 8 police stopped about 15 to 20 MDC members </p><p>who attempted to march from Africa Unity Square in downtown </p><p>Harare to the US Embassy to deliver a petition.  While the </p><p>Daily News reported the number of demonstrators to be about </p><p>3000, reports from witnesses put the number at 15 - 20. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) On July 8, Harare Executive Mayor Elias Mudzuri was </p><p>re-arrested, held in a Harare Central Police Station cell for </p><p>seven hours and released without charge.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Non-Demonstration </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) On July 8 about 15 to 20 MDC members attempted to </p><p>march from Africa Unity Square in downtown Harare to the US </p><p>Embassy to deliver a petition criticizing South African </p><p>President Thabo Mbeki for lack of progress in resolving the </p><p>Zimbabwe crisis, and calling on the USG to pressure the GOZ </p><p>to agree to dialogue with the MDC.  Riot police broke up the </p><p>march before it started by beating and arresting several </p><p>would-be marchers.  According to march organizer Dennis </p><p>Murerwa, special assistant to MDC National Chairman Isaac </p><p>Matongo, the march was an MDC-organized mass action event </p><p>primarily done for publicity, rather than to deliver the </p><p>petition to the US Embassy.  Murerwa said the MDC leadership </p><p>sanctioned plans for ongoing mass actions, however may not </p><p>have been aware of specific plans for this march.  The </p><p>Embassy was not contacted, and has not yet received the </p><p>petition, but Murerwa promised to deliver it to Poloff on </p><p>July 9. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) A Daily News article on July 9 reported that about </p><p>3000 demonstrators marched through the streets of downtown </p><p>Harare carrying placards criticizing Mbeki and attempted to </p><p>gather at Africa Unity Square.  RSO and RSOfsn spoke with a </p><p>street vendor in Africa Unity Square on July 8 who reported </p><p>that only about 15 - 20 demonstrators were involved.  A </p><p>different source also reported to the Ambassador that the </p><p>number gathered was more like 15 - 20. </p><p> </p><p>Harare Mayor Released </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) On July 8, Harare Executive Mayor Elias Mudzuri was </p><p>re-arrested, held in a Harare Central Police Station cell for </p><p>seven hours and released without charge.  According to a </p><p>report in the Daily News, and Mudzuri\'s lawyer Beatrice </p><p>Mtetwa, Mudzuri intends to go to his office on July 9 for the </p><p>third consecutive day to face arrest.  Minister of Local </p><p>Government, Ignatius Chombo suspended the mayor in April 2003 </p><p>for alleged misconduct.  Mudzuri, the MDC, and the Combined </p><p>Harare Residents Association claimed the suspension was </p><p>illegal, and the matter is pending in court (Refs A and B). </p><p> </p><p>Comment: </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) The blatant discrepancy between the number of </p><p>demonstrators who actually showed up, and the number reported </p><p>in the Daily News does nothing for the credibility of that </p><p>paper in reporting on charged political events.  End Comment. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
