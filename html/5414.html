If Iraq does not obey, papers argue that war is </p><p>inevitable.  Persuaded by the Bush speech, France and Russia </p><p>voiced readiness to join the international coalition if </p><p>there is sufficient evidence about the Iraqi threat.  `We </p><p>will continue consultations.  But if Saddam does not fully </p><p>disarm for our nation\'s security and for global peace, we </p><p>will lead an international coalition to disarm him,\' </p><p>President Bush said. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Iraq: In a statement on Wednesday, the TGS said that troops </p><p>and military equipment have been sent to the Iraqi border to </p><p>enhance the readiness of Turkish military units in the </p><p>region.  The statement noted that the military buildup </p><p>should not be seen as a sign of Turkey\'s willingness to </p><p>enter war with Iraq.  The MFA Spokesman on Wednesday urged </p><p>the U.S. to disclose evidence regarding Iraqi WMD, and noted </p><p>that Turkey may review its Iraq policy after seeing the </p><p>proof presented by the U.S.  "Hurriyet" reports that U.S. </p><p>experts have presented Turkey new demands regarding the </p><p>modernization of Turkish airbases, including the enlargement </p><p>of runways and improvements in radar and air traffic </p><p>security systems.  "Aksam" claims that the U.S. will </p><p>transfer troops directly to Mosul and Kirkuk if Turkey </p><p>denies transit passage.  An Aksam article draws attention to </p><p>LA Times reports that the U.S. has 20 nuclear bombs on </p><p>Incirlik airbase, and would not necessarily wait for Iraq to </p><p>launch a chemical or nuclear attack before using them.  Such </p><p>press reports have not been denied by the U.S. </p><p>Administration, the paper notes.  "Milliyet" says that </p><p>Turkey and the U.S. have already agreed to transfer 20,000 </p><p>U.S. troops to Iraq across Turkish territory.  Milliyet </p><p>highlights a statement by the Iranian Ambassador to Ankara </p><p>that Turkey can prevent the U.S. from waging war against </p><p>Iraq.  The Iranian Ambassador noted that it would be risky </p><p>for the Americans to launch an attack without Turkish </p><p>support.  January\'s National Security Council (NSC) meeting </p><p>on Friday will discuss several war scenarios, according to </p><p>press reports.  The NSC will discuss ways to tackle the </p><p>uncertainty that might prevail in the region in the face of </p><p>a U.S. failure, and how to handle a possible civil war or </p><p>rebellion by the Kurds. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Cyprus: President Sezer and military members of the National </p><p>Security Council (NSC) are expected to issue warnings to the </p><p>government about AKP leader Erdogan\'s remarks concerning </p><p>Cyprus and Denktas at the Council\'s monthly meeting on </p><p>Friday.  The military is expected to warn the government </p><p>that Erdogan, a figure with no official status in the </p><p>Government, should refrain from making statements that cause </p><p>trouble for Turkey.  The MFA Spokesman on Wednesday denied </p><p>reports about tension between Denktas and Erdogan, and said </p><p>that Turkey has made a significant contribution to the </p><p>strategy followed by Denktas.  UN Cyprus envoy De Soto, who </p><p>met Erdogan in Ankara on Wednesday, complained about </p><p>Denktas\' unwillingness to attend negotiations, and stressed </p><p>that a new plan could be prepared that might fit his </p><p>expectations.  Some papers speculate that Foreign Minister </p><p>Yakis, who has chosen to make statements that contradict </p><p>Erdogan on Cyprus, might lose his post in a cabinet </p><p>reshuffle when Erdogan becomes Prime Minister.  Dailies say </p><p>that theAKP administration was angered at Yakis for voicing </p><p>open support to Denktas while Erdogan has blamed the Turkish </p><p>Cypriot leader for the deadlock.  "Cumhuriyet" claims that </p><p>Erdogan has been `left alone\' on the Cyprus issue.  The </p><p>paper notes that even Prime  Minister Gul told the UK PM </p><p>Blair on the phone the other day that Turkey would not </p><p>accept the Annan plan without changes. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION:  State of the Union </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The war message" </p><p>Sami Kohen wrote in mass appeal Milliyet (1/30): "The State </p><p>of the Union address can be summarized into one message: war </p><p>is coming.  Although President Bush did not declare a war or </p><p>give an ultimatum to Saddam, his approach to the Iraq issue </p><p>as well as his harsh rhetoric clearly indicated Washington\'s </p><p>determination to strike Iraq. . It seems that right after </p><p>the presentation of new evidence about Iraq, the US will </p><p>seek a second UNSC resolution.  Yet even in the absence of </p><p>another resolution, the military option will be implemented. </p><p>President Bush seems determined to go ahead with his </p><p>`unilateralist doctrine\' if and when he feels necessary." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Bush pushed the war button" </p><p>Mehmet Ali Birand wrote in sensational-mass appeal Posta </p><p>(1/30): "The gist of President Bush\'s message was as </p><p>follows: war is inevitable.  The US will act, unilaterally </p><p>if necessary, in order to finish Saddam Hussein.  President </p><p>Bush is on the path of no return.  Regardless of popular </p><p>reactions or even in the absence of a second UNSC </p><p>resolution, Washington will topple Saddam. . The State of </p><p>the Union also provided a calendar of events: February 15, </p><p>UNMOVIC\'s follow up report; February 20, UNSC\'s second </p><p>resolution debate; and in March, the military operation will </p><p>begin." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Defying the world" </p><p>Mustafa Balbay wrote in social democrat-intellectual </p><p>Cumhuriyet (1/30): "The state of the union has turned into a </p><p>state of defiance to the whole world.  The US seems very </p><p>determined to launch a military operation against Iraq.  The </p><p>debate within the administration now centers on `how to </p><p>handle the aftermath\' instead of `shall we do it or not.\'  . </p><p>Bush claims that Iraq has a huge variety of weapons, and the </p><p>US intends to present evidence to the UN.  The information </p><p>must have been provided by multi-national companies which </p><p>engage in arms deal with Iraq.  . The US did not present any </p><p>tangible evidence on the eve of the Afghan operation, and </p><p>this time the same thing seems to be happening.  Most </p><p>likely, the US will present `something\' in the name of </p><p>`proof\' and we will all have to see it that way." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
