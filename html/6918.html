<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 002048 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/28/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PINS, IZ, CY, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY\'S "WHERE ARE THEY NOW" FILE: CHP\'S KEMAL </p><p>DERVIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: 02 ANKARA 7606 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Acting Political Counselor Nicholas S. </p><p>Kass.  Reason: 1.5(b)(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) In a March 28 meeting with poloff, opposition CHP </p><p>deputy and former State Minster Kemal Dervis offered his </p><p>views of USG-GOT relations, Iraq, Cyprus, and his own </p><p>political ambitions.  Dervis made the following points: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- He sees himself as leading an effort to modernize CHP, in </p><p>part by trying to bring more women into the party fold; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- CHP, he stated, has always maintained a close political </p><p>and ideological relationship with the Turkish military.  An </p><p>analysis of Nov. 2002 election voting patterns reveals, he </p><p>claimed, that CHP won 80% of vote in areas heavily populated </p><p>by the military and their dependents; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- CHP\'s core is dominated by traditional Kemalism -- </p><p>"statism, suspicion of foreigners, and nationalism," Dervis </p><p>explained.  Ataturk had voiced some important truths -- among </p><p>these the idea that his own principles were subject to </p><p>change.  Unfortunately, the hard-core Kemalists in CHP (and </p><p>elsewhere) "refuse to modernize."  To them, modernization is </p><p>simply a Trojan horse for foreign interests that conflict </p><p>with Kemalism -- and thus threaten Turkey; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- On Iraq, Dervis tried to walk both sides of the fence.  He </p><p>said he supported USG overall goals, but as an </p><p>"internationalist" he cannot support "the way you are doing </p><p>it."  According to Dervis, CHP\'s opposition to the US-led war </p><p>effort is due to a variety of reasons, including: 1) a </p><p>primitive oppositionist impulse in CHP; and 2) traditional </p><p>leftist anti-war sentiments.  He offered the self-serving and </p><p>somewhat mystifying rationalization that, had CHP supported </p><p>the government on Iraq, anti-American sentiment in Turkey </p><p>"would be even more intense than it is now." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Regarding Cyprus, Dervis asserted that Turkey is not to </p><p>blame for the failure of the UNSYG sponsored settlement </p><p>talks.  The problem, he noted, "has deep historical roots." </p><p>Turkish psychology on this issue is complex; it is important </p><p>to avoid feeding the perception among Turks that "something </p><p>is being imposed on them." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Once seen as CHP\'s shining political star, Dervis\' </p><p>luster has faded considerably since the Nov. 2002 elections. </p><p>CHP leader Deniz Baykal -- perhaps seeing Dervis as a </p><p>potential rival -- excluded him from important committees and </p><p>CHP executive organs.  Instead, Dervis became head of CHP\'s </p><p>politically impotent science research arm.  According to CHP </p><p>M.P. and Human Rights Committee member Engin Altay, Dervis is </p><p>relegated to "producing reports that no one reads."  Many of </p><p>our CHP contacts say Dervis rarely even makes an appearance </p><p>at Parliament. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Dervis\' many years in the United States and </p><p>familiarity with the wider world insulates him from many of </p><p>the xenophobic pathologies of his colleagues in the </p><p>Establishment intelligentsia and other circles.  His private </p><p>criticism of Kemalism -- at odds with his politically </p><p>problematic public comments in the days before the elections </p><p>(reftel) -- have considerable merit.  Nevertheless, he </p><p>displays at a minimum a high degree of comfort with the party </p><p>line of CHP boss Deniz Baykal.  Before the election, </p><p>erstwhile Dervis allies began to criticize him for "selling </p><p>out" to Baykalism and its principal-free approach to </p><p>politics.  Dervis\' performance to date as a politician has </p><p>done nothing to dispel such sentiments. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
