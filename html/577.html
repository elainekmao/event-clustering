<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KHARTOUM 08788 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CAIRO ALSO FOR ASST SECTY. COHEN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MOPS, SU, SO </p><p>SUBJECT: TFS 0001: SOMALIA: SUDANESE GOVERNMENT BEGINS </p><p>TO REACT TO PROSPECTS FOR U.S. FORCES IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A. KHARTOUM OB?12 </p><p>      B. KHARTOUM OB?57 </p><p>      C. KHARTOUM 08766 </p><p> </p><p>1.  IN WHAT THE GOVERNMENT CONTROLLED MEDIA HERE </p><p>TERM "AN EXPRESSION OF ANXIETY," SUDAN\'S HEAD OF </p><p>STATE, LT. GEM. OMAR AL BASHIR, IN HIS DECEMBER </p><p>2ND PRESS CONFERENCE, SAID HE HAS WORRIED ABOUT </p><p>"THE SUDDEN ESCALATION OF THE CONFLICT IN </p><p>SOMALIA AND THE U.N. DECISION TO SEND FORTY </p><p>THOUSAND (SIC) U.S. FORCES TO THAT SMALL </p><p>COUNTRY." </p><p> </p><p>2.  BASHIR EMPHASIZED THAT "SUCH A LARGE-SCALE </p><p>FOREIGN INTERVENTION AT THE SIZE FIXED BY THE </p><p>U.N. WILL AGGRAVATE THE PROBLEM..."  HE ALSO </p><p>COMPLAINED THAT THE INTERVENTION IGNORES THE </p><p>"EFFORTS WHICH ARE BEING EXERTED BY THE </p><p>COUNTRIES OF THE HORN OF AFRICA..." WHICH HAD </p><p>"RECEIVED POSITIVE RESPONSES FROM ALL THE </p><p>CONFLICTING FACTIONS." </p><p> </p><p>3.  BASHIR ASSERTED THAT THE EFFORTS OF THE </p><p>"COUNTRIES IN THE AREA COULD RESULT IN THE </p><p>SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM."  ACCORDING TO HIM, </p><p>"SOMALIA HAS RECENTLY WITNESSED RELATIVE </p><p>STABILITY DUE TO THE PEACE EFFORTS CARRIED OUT </p><p>BY THE COUNTRIES OF THE HORN OF AFRICA."  HE </p><p>CALLED FOR AVOIDING ESCALATION. </p><p> </p><p>4.  SUMMING UP, BASHIR SAID; "SUDAN VIEWED THE </p><p>DISPATCH OF AMERICAN AND INTERNATIONAL FORCES TO </p><p>SOMALIA...AS UNJUSTIFIED AND PART OF AN </p><p>INTERNATIONAL CONSPIRACY AIMING FOR A MILITARY </p><p>PRESENCE IN THE HORN OF AFRICA REGION, WHICH </p><p>OVERLOOKS THE MOST IMPORTANT WATERWAY IN THE </p><p>WORLD..." </p><p> </p><p>5.  IN NAIROBI, FOR TALKS ON CONTINUING SUDAN\'S </p><p>STALLED PEACE PROCESS, DELEGATION CHIEF AND </p><p>MAJOR ISLAMIC FRONT FIGURE DR. ALI AL HAJ TOLD </p><p>THE PRESS THAT THE MOVEMENT OF U.S. FORCES INTO </p><p>SOMALIA "WOULD CAUSE INTERNATIONAL ANARCHY, </p><p>NON-RESPECT OF NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY AND A NEW </p><p>FORM OF IMPERIALISM." </p><p> </p><p>6.  COMMENT:  WE EXPECT SUDANESE ANXIETIES TO </p><p>RISE EVEN MORE AS THE INTERVENTION UNFOLDS.  THE </p><p>INTERPLAY OF STEADILY WORSENING RELATIONS WITH </p><p>THE U.S. AND THE OTHER INDUSTRIAL DEMOCRACIES </p><p>(AS WELL AS WITH SOME OF SUDAN\'S NEIGHBORS) AND </p><p>THE U.N\'S CONDEMNATION OF SUDAN\'S HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>ABUSES IS PRODUCING A CUMULATIVE ISOLATING </p><p>EFFECT ON THIS HARD-LINE REGIME.  THE FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER\'S VERY OUT OF STEP COMMENTS TO </p><p>AMBASSADOR (REFTEL C) SHOW ALSO THE DISARRAY THE </p><p>ACTION IS CAUSING INSIDE THE FRACTIOUS GOS. </p><p> </p><p>7.  AS REFTEL A REPORTS, THE SUDANESE PUBLIC IS </p><p>REACTING, AT TIMES QUITE ILLOGICALLY, TO WHAT </p><p>THEY SEE AS A CHANGE IN THE POLITICAL </p><p>ENVIRONMENT IN THIS REGION.  REFTEL B GIVING </p><p>MORE PRESS REACTION, RECORDS "THE MODERN SUDAN" </p><p>FRETTING THAT; "THE INFLUX OF SUCH A HUGE NUMBER </p><p>OF TROOPS WILL...EXPAND INTO AN ORGANIZED </p><p>INVASION OF THE WHOLE REGION." </p><p> </p><p>8.  THE INCREASING INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE ON THE </p><p>GOS, THE INTRODUCTION OF U.S. AND OTHER WESTERN </p><p>FORCES INTO THE HORN, WHATEVER THEIR MISSION AND </p><p>ITS STATED LIMITATIONS, AND THE CONTINUED WAVES </p><p>OF RUMOR AND SUPPOSITION ABOUT GOVERNMENTAL </p><p>SHIFTS HERE ARE TAKING A TOLL.  THE STREET RATE </p><p>ON U.S. DOLLARS HAS MOVED UP QUICKLY THIS WEEK </p><p>TO ONE HUNDRED SIXTY SUDANESE POUNDS FROM ONE </p><p>FORTY-EIGHT AND DOLLARS ARE NOW VERY SCARCE.  WE </p><p>EXPECT MORE OF THIS TO COME. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PETTERSON </p><p></p></div>
