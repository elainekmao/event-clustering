(U) This is an action cable.  Please see Paragraph 13 </p><p>below. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  To date, the Government of Vietnam (GVN) </p><p>has made little, if any, progress towards achieving the </p><p>goals set forth in the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) </p><p>signed in Hanoi on March 10, 2002, following bilateral </p><p>meetings held in Hanoi after the International Agent </p><p>Orange/Dioxin Conference funded by the U.S. National </p><p>Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS). </p><p>Embassy believes that this lack of progress reflects the </p><p>unwillingness of the GVN to allow its scientists to engage </p><p>in genuinely transparent, open rigorous scientific </p><p>investigation to determine the true extent of the impact of </p><p>AO/dioxin on health in Vietnam.  We believe that the GVN </p><p>will attempt to control, disrupt, or block any research </p><p>project that could potentially produce scientific evidence </p><p>that refutes the GVN\'s allegations of broad, catastrophic </p><p>damage to the health of Vietnamese citizens, especially </p><p>birth defects.  Joint research on the environmental issues </p><p>will probably be limited to projects that focus on soil </p><p>sampling and searches for low-cost emerging remediation </p><p>technologies.  Another factor that has hampered overall </p><p>Vietnamese responsiveness has been the disruption of the </p><p>leadership and functioning of National Steering Committee 33 </p><p>(responsible for oversight of all issues related to Agent </p><p>Orange) that resulted from the creation of the Ministry of </p><p>National Resources and Environment in August 2002.  Despite </p><p>this assessment, the Embassy advocates continuing the USG </p><p>effort to promote cooperative scientific research programs, </p><p>while at the same time taking a straightforward approach to </p><p>counter the Vietnamese propaganda campaign that hinges on </p><p>non-scientific, but visually effective and emotionally </p><p>charged, methodology aimed at laying blame on the USG.  Two </p><p>new proposed projects funded by NIEHS, one in environmental </p><p>remediation technologies and one in health research related </p><p>to pregnancy, will provide a gauge by which to further </p><p>assess Vietnamese attitudes and intentions.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) Dr. Anne Sassaman, Director, Extramural Grant </p><p>Program, National Institute of Environmental Health </p><p>Sciences, visited Hanoi during October 27-31, 2002, to </p><p>continue the dialogue with Vietnamese counterparts on joint </p><p>scientific research on health and environmental effects of </p><p>Agent Orange (AO)/dioxin in Vietnam, and to determine status </p><p>of Vietnamese efforts and attitudes towards pursuit of goals </p><p>defined in the Memorandum of Understanding signed on March </p><p>10, 2002, following bilateral discussions in Hanoi. </p><p>Embassy/Hanoi EST Officer accompanied Dr. Sassaman to most </p><p>of her relevant meetings.  In November, Dr. Sassaman briefed </p><p>members of the Interagency Working Group on AO/Dioxin (IWG- </p><p>AO/D) in Washington on the results of her visit.  On January </p><p>16, 2003, Embassy EST Officer met with Dr. Nguyen Tien Dung, </p><p>Director, Office 33, to follow-up on the unresolved issues </p><p>that had been discussed during Dr. Sassaman\'s visit.  In </p><p>early February, EST Officer also met with NIEHS officer in </p><p>charge of organizing an environmental assessment and </p><p>remediation workshop and the U.S. lead investigator in a </p><p>joint health research project that has received approval and </p><p>funding by NIEHS.  Embassy wishes to provide the IWG with </p><p>our observations and assessment of Vietnamese attitudes </p><p>toward implementation on joint scientific research. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Although the history of U.S. Government (USG) </p><p>efforts to engage the Vietnamese in joint scientific </p><p>research go back as far as 1994, we will look at events over </p><p>the past two years, beginning in December 2000 at the </p><p>bilateral meetings held in Singapore.  Based on our </p><p>observations of Vietnamese behavior over the past two years, </p><p>interaction with key players and observers on the Vietnamese </p><p>side following the March 2002 International Conference in </p><p>Hanoi funded by NIEHS, the results of Dr. Sassaman\'s recent </p><p>visit, and EST Officer\'s recent meetings with Office 33, the </p><p>Embassy\'s assessment is that the Government of Vietnam (GVN) </p><p>has no intentions of allowing its scientists to engage in </p><p>genuinely transparent, open, rigorous scientific </p><p>investigation to determine the true extent of the impact of </p><p>AO/dioxin on health in Vietnam.  Why?  Because, we believe, </p><p>the GVN will never permit research that in any way might </p><p>discredit the main theme of its two-decade long propaganda </p><p>campaign, i.e., AO/dioxin is to blame for a huge range of </p><p>serious health problems - especially birth defects and </p><p>mental retardation - of residents of central and southern </p><p>areas and/or northern soldiers who served there.  We feel </p><p>certain that many responsible GVN and Communist Party </p><p>officials know that allegations of the extreme degree of </p><p>adverse impact of AO/dioxin on health are grossly </p><p>exaggerated and unsupported by any objective measure.  Thus, </p><p>to engage in a truly comprehensive scientific research </p><p>program would expose the official folly, and place the </p><p>government in an untenable position.  It would also open a </p><p>Pandora\'s Box of questions about why the GVN - and more </p><p>importantly, the Communist Party - has misled its people and </p><p>focused on demonizing AO/dioxin and failed to carry out </p><p>appropriate public health programs that could have mitigated </p><p>other sources of threats to human health.  It is our </p><p>assessment that the GVN will permit only research that they </p><p>are confident will support and/or lend credence to their </p><p>claims.  Thus, any proposal that includes verifiable </p><p>measures of exposure, and independent validation of </p><p>diagnosis, the sine-qua-non of scientific study for health </p><p>impact assessment, will not be acceptable to the GVN.  If </p><p>there is any uncertainty about the outcome of the research, </p><p>they will either not approve it or cancel it if subsequent </p><p>indications imply that the results could contradict their </p><p>propaganda message.  We believe there are Vietnamese </p><p>scientists who, if given the opportunity, would seek to </p><p>conduct high quality scientific research.  No matter what </p><p>their motives and intentions, virtually all Vietnamese </p><p>scientists view joint research with U.S. experts as an </p><p>excellent mechanism by which to acquire training, equipment, </p><p>and technology.   Why did the GVN finally agree to </p><p>scientific research?  In our view, they realized that </p><p>agreement to engage in joint research would give the </p><p>appearance of cooperation with the USG, while at the same </p><p>enhance their leverage in pursuit of their main objective - </p><p>financial compensation and support for research </p><p>infrastructure from audiences sympathetic to their </p><p>propaganda message.  Thus, we believe the GVN\'s highest </p><p>priority continues to be waging its ongoing propaganda </p><p>campaign to morally indict the USG in collaborations with </p><p>sympathetic members of the broader international community </p><p>as its highest priority.  Engagement in a scientific </p><p>research endeavor is a secondary, supporting effort of the </p><p>primary strategy to force the USG to bow to international </p><p>pressure and in the words of several of the international </p><p>interlocutors of the GVN\'s position, "address the chemical </p><p>holocaust that has been visited on Vietnam - to fully </p><p>remunerate and premeditate the devastation caused and denied </p><p>since the 1960\'s." </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) On the environmental side, the Vietnamese probably </p><p>will not attempt to exert such heavy-handed control because </p><p>the focus of initial research is to test/evaluate relatively </p><p>inexpensive emerging soil sampling and remediation </p><p>technologies in locations where both sides agree there is a </p><p>high probability of dioxin residue in the soil (i.e., the </p><p>suspected "hot spots").  The ongoing pilot project between </p><p>U.S. EPA and the Vietnamese scientists at a suspected hot </p><p>spot in Danang Airbase is the only ongoing project upon </p><p>which to judge Vietnamese behavior.  We note that permission </p><p>for the soil samples obtained from that site to be sent back </p><p>to the U.S. for state-of-the-art testing was not granted </p><p>until after/after the soil sampling tests in Hanoi </p><p>demonstrated the high probability of a heavy dioxin residue. </p><p>We are waiting on the results of the testing in the U.S. and </p><p>follow-up visits by EPA.  The next phase of the "Danang </p><p>Project" is to seek methods of defining the parameters of a </p><p>"hot spot" and evaluating/assessing emerging low-cost </p><p>technologies for a pilot remediation project.  The </p><p>counterpart Vietnamese scientists are enthusiastic about </p><p>this project. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) The Vietnamese are more willing to study the </p><p>environmental effects, but we anticipate that there are </p><p>caveats.  We predict they will not participate in or allow </p><p>studies that would cause problems for their agricultural </p><p>export industries.  Thus, any study that looks at dioxin </p><p>contamination of food products will only be permitted if it </p><p>cannot be generalized to types and classes of foods that are </p><p>only of commercial importance to Vietnam, or in areas that </p><p>do not have any commercial food production.  Thus, it will </p><p>never be possible to do broad and scientifically useful </p><p>ecologic studies of dioxin.  Second, they will not permit </p><p>studies that undermine their propaganda campaign.  For </p><p>example, the Hatfield Consultants research report showed </p><p>that in the areas of heaviest spraying, the AO/dioxin </p><p>applied by aerial spraying was no longer at levels </p><p>considered hazardous to health.  This finding has never been </p><p>publicly admitted or commented on by the Vietnamese - and </p><p>subsequent soil sampling for areas of aerial spraying has </p><p>not been permitted. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) National Steering Committee 33, the entity </p><p>responsible for oversight and management of all programs to </p><p>deal with all issues related to AO, is composed of </p><p>representatives from at least ten different ministries or </p><p>equivalent level organizations.  The government decree that </p><p>established Committee 33 is classified "secret"; most or all </p><p>documents related to AO or the committee\'s actions are also </p><p>classified as they are considered to have national security </p><p>implications.  The senior representative from each ministry </p><p>or agency is a Vice-Minister or equivalent rank.  Committee </p><p>33 guides/controls the health and environmental research, </p><p>the internal propaganda campaign, the campaign to acquire </p><p>foreign donations, etc.  Although we do not know the precise </p><p>mechanisms by which this committee operates, we assume that </p><p>ministries such as S&T, Natural Resources and Environment, </p><p>Foreign Affairs, Health, Culture and Information, National </p><p>Defense, and Public Security as well as the Communist Party </p><p>Central Committee and the National Assembly play important, </p><p>key roles in the decision making process.  Former Minister </p><p>of Science, Technology and Environment Dr. Chu Tuan Nha </p><p>served as the Chairman until he was replaced as Minister in </p><p>August 2002.   Minister Nha, a scientist, was viewed by the </p><p>Embassy as someone with a generally pragmatic, objective </p><p>attitude who supported scientific research (but still </p><p>spouted the party line about "victims" when necessary).  In </p><p>October 2002, Committee 33 Standing Vice-Chairman Dr. Pham </p><p>Khoi Nguyen, who has now moved from his position of Vice- </p><p>Minister of S&T to become a Vice-Minister in the newly </p><p>created Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment </p><p>(MONRE), told Dr. Sassaman that a recommendation had gone </p><p>forward to the Office of Government to appoint a Deputy </p><p>Prime Minister (DPM) to chair the committee.  Dr. Nguyen </p><p>commented that elevating the chair to a higher level would </p><p>make the Committee more efficient (presumably because a DPM </p><p>would have more clout to resolve disputes between </p><p>ministries).  However, in January 2003, the GVN issued a </p><p>decree appointing Mr. Mai Ai Truc, Minister of Natural </p><p>Resources and Environment, as the new Chairman.  Although </p><p>the chairmanship was not elevated to the DPM level, </p><p>oversight of Committee 33 was shifted from DPM Pham Gia </p><p>Khiem, whose portfolio includes S&T and education, to First </p><p>DPM Nguyen Tan Dung.   This shift in oversight of Committee </p><p>33 coincided with placement of MONRE under the oversight of </p><p>DPM Dung.  Minister Truc is not a scientist.  His academic </p><p>background is literature; his entire career has been spent </p><p>working in the Party and/or People\'s Committee of Binh Dinh </p><p>Province.   Despite Minister Truc\'s lack of scientific </p><p>credentials, he has told the Ambassador that he has first- </p><p>hand experience with the spraying of AO and AO\'s impact on </p><p>the environment and health.  He said that, in his home </p><p>province, AO had caused bananas to grow to an enormous size. </p><p>The poor, starving residents had no choice but to eat this </p><p>AO-contaminated fruit.  As a result, the women had borne </p><p>many children with birth defects.  Minister Truc\'s comments </p><p>dovetailed nicely with the Vietnamese propaganda line.  The </p><p>Ambassador responded politely that there could be many other </p><p>possible causes of birth defects, including deficiencies in </p><p>prenatal care and the diet of pregnant women, and this </p><p>potential myriad of factors was the basis for the USG\'s </p><p>desire to conduct good scientific research to find the </p><p>answers. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) In discussions with the Dr. Nguyen Tien Dung, </p><p>Director of Office 33 (permanent staff for Committee 33), </p><p>Dr. Sassaman described the process for </p><p>reviewing/approving/funding research grants submitted to </p><p>NIEHS.  A key feature was the independent peer review to </p><p>evaluate the quality of the science.  Dr. Dung explained </p><p>that, in the Vietnamese process for research on topics </p><p>related to AO/dioxin, a proposal would undergo scientific </p><p>review (not an independent peer review, but one conducted by </p><p>a government ministry, such as Ministry of Health for health- </p><p>related research), and then go to Committee 33 for final </p><p>approval.  Committee 33\'s decision would be based not on the </p><p>merits of the science and/or potential benefits to </p><p>understanding the issue, but rather on non-scientific </p><p>factors and points of view (e.g., internal political, </p><p>national defense).  Both Dr. Dung and MONRE Vice-Minister </p><p>Dr. Pham Khoi Nguyen frequently used the term "control" when </p><p>describing Committee 33\'s role.  Dr. Dung explained that </p><p>data/information related to GVN policy on AO was still </p><p>considered a "state secret" and water, soil, human </p><p>tissue/blood samples were also considered to be state </p><p>secrets.  Committee 33\'s approval would be required each </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>time a scientist wished to send such items out of Vietnam </p><p>for testing and analysis.  In response to a question about </p><p>the process for obtaining approvals, Dr. Dung explained that </p><p>even if Committee 33 approved a research proposal that </p><p>clearly defined parameters of health research (defined </p><p>geographic area, target population, intended use of samples, </p><p>etc), approval would not be a blanket approval for the </p><p>lifetime of the project.  Committee 33 would have to approve </p><p>the shipment of each batch of samples.  The authority cannot </p><p>be delegated to a single senior official or to a sub- </p><p>committee.  This control factor would allow the Vietnamese </p><p>to stifle a research project at any point.  In this context, </p><p>Dr. Sassaman and Dr. Dung discussed the unresolved issues in </p><p>the MOU related to:  a) the degree to which research </p><p>findings will be made available to the international </p><p>scientific community; b) the avenues through which research </p><p>findings will be published; and c) the process that must be </p><p>followed for publication approval.  Dr. Dung\'s description </p><p>of the Vietnamese perception of these issues was that </p><p>"control" (of information and research findings) was of </p><p>paramount concern to Committee 33.  Dr. Sassaman explained </p><p>that no credible U.S. researcher would be willing to invest </p><p>time and effort into a project which could be undermined or </p><p>whose findings could not be published.  Dr. Sassaman </p><p>stressed that this was not a point to be taken lightly, and </p><p>Dr. Dung promised to relay her remarks to Committee 33. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU) On January 16, 2003, EST Officer met with Dr. Dung </p><p>to discuss the status of  Vietnam\'s efforts to move forward </p><p>on the issues discussed with Dr. Sassaman.  Dr. Dung offered </p><p>the following. </p><p> </p><p>         -- Office 33 has submitted a proposal to Committee </p><p>33 and Chairman Truc for establishing a mechanism for </p><p>general approval for human tissue and blood samples to be </p><p>sent abroad for testing and analysis.  Dr. Dung would not </p><p>offer an anticipated timeframe for approval. </p><p> </p><p>         -- Committee 33 has not yet appointed Vietnamese </p><p>members of a Vietnam-US Joint Advisory Committee, which per </p><p>the March 10 (2002) Memorandum of Understanding, would be </p><p>established to define the scope of the joint research </p><p>program; coordinate the collaborative research program on </p><p>human health and environmental effects of Agent </p><p>Orange/Dioxin; and review and approve research content areas </p><p>under the program.  (BEGIN COMMENT:  The U.S. members were </p><p>appointed in the summer of 2002.  END COMMENT) </p><p> </p><p>         -- Dr. Dung advised that Committee 33 had not yet </p><p>received the Vietnamese text of a joint grant proposal for </p><p>joint health research project submitted to NIEHS by a U.S. </p><p>investigator with a Vietnamese Ministry of Health </p><p>counterpart investigator.   (BEGIN COMMENT:  During Dr. </p><p>Sassaman\'s October 2002 visit, she discussed this proposal </p><p>with both Dr. Dung and the Vietnamese investigator.  At that </p><p>time, the Vietnamese investigator stated that the proposal </p><p>was being translated into Vietnamese.  Subsequently, in </p><p>January 2003, the proposal was evaluated via NIEHS\'s </p><p>independent peer review board and scored well enough to </p><p>receive funding.   EST Officer informed Dr. Dung that NIEHS </p><p>would be willing to fund the project only/only after </p><p>receiving formal confirmation that Committee 33 had approved </p><p>the project, and the issues of publication and human </p><p>tissue/blood testing had been resolved.   END COMMENT) </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU) The following is a brief review of GVN actions </p><p>that tend to support our assessment. </p><p>         --During the December 2000 bilateral talks in </p><p>Singapore, the Vietnamese delegation spent three days in a </p><p>failed attempt to get the U.S. side to sign a Memorandum of </p><p>Understanding which included a U.S. commitment to provide </p><p>humanitarian assistance to all the "victims" of AO/dioxin as </p><p>a pre-condition for engaging in joint scientific research. </p><p>A central theme was "the research has already been done and </p><p>we already know the results show direct cause-effect </p><p>relationship between AO/dioxin and the health of Vietnamese </p><p>people." </p><p> </p><p>         --The Vietnamese print and visual media </p><p>consistently conveys the message that there are many </p><p>"victims" of AO for which the USG should accept </p><p>responsibility providing humanitarian assistance.  The </p><p>frequency and tone sharpen just before and just after </p><p>significant events. </p><p> </p><p>         --The Vietnamese organizers (under direction from </p><p>Committee 33) refused to allow the international press to </p><p>attend the March 2002 conference.  Following the conference, </p><p>the main theme of Vietnamese media articles was not related </p><p>to the science.  Rather, the theme was "the USG finally </p><p>admitted that U.S. military forces had sprayed millions of </p><p>gallons of AO during the war." </p><p> </p><p>         --The GVN\'s consistent, persistent message has </p><p>been, "we do not need the science to prove a link between </p><p>AO/dioxin and the health of our people.   We already have </p><p>the proof."  This message runs counter to any expression of </p><p>intent to engage in serious joint scientific research, but </p><p>it is being parroted by the press (as mouthpieces of the </p><p>Party and the bureaucracy of government), by government </p><p>officials at all levels, by educated citizens in all walks </p><p>of life, and by many international NGOs and other </p><p>institutions.  The success of the propaganda campaign has </p><p>strengthened the GVN\'s resolve to continue on that front </p><p>while at the same time maintaining a faade of willingness </p><p>to engage the U.S. in scientific research on health effects. </p><p> </p><p>         --Except for the Danang soil sampling project, the </p><p>GVN has made no progress towards achieving goals set forth </p><p>in the March 10 MOU, not even to appoint members to the </p><p>joint advisory committee that is to provide oversight to </p><p>define the scope of the overall joint research program; </p><p>coordinate the collaborative research program on human </p><p>health and environmental effects of Agent Orange/Dioxin; and </p><p>review and approve research content areas under the program. </p><p>The creation of MONRE and the subsequent turmoil caused in </p><p>establishing a new management team within Committee 33 can </p><p>explain some of the inertia.  However, at the same time, the </p><p>propaganda campaign was not disrupted. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (SBU) As an indicator of the pervasiveness of the </p><p>Vietnamese position on AO/dioxin, we would like to share the </p><p>failure of our recent efforts to engage the Vietnamese in a </p><p>broader effort to look at public health issues that that </p><p>might be easily resolved.  At several points, HHS has </p><p>suggested to Vietnamese counterparts an affordable and </p><p>effective national campaign to eliminate cretinism. </p><p>Multiple sets of national data strongly indicate that </p><p>cretinism is the leading cause of preventable mental </p><p>retardation.  Hypothyroidism in pregnant women due to lack </p><p>of iodine has been a national epidemic for as long as the </p><p>data has been recorded.  Multiple surveys have shown </p><p>prevalence rates of between 15 and 40% of goiter in pregnant </p><p>women.  Various biochemical surveys have documented many </p><p>pregnant women with no detectable iodine in their urine. </p><p>This provides conclusive evidence that their baby will be </p><p>born with a significant mental defect, and in many cases, </p><p>with severe and profound mental retardation.  Off the </p><p>record, many international public health experts estimate </p><p>numbers of cretins born each year in Vietnam at a minimum in </p><p>the tens of thousands.  However, we have been unable to get </p><p>the GVN to engage in a substantive, high priority national </p><p>program for elimination of this deficiency.  There could be </p><p>various reasons for the GVN\'s reluctance to start such a </p><p>program.  We understand that it took the World Health </p><p>Organization many years to convince some African countries </p><p>to participate in a similar program.  However, we must </p><p>assume that some knowledgeable Vietnamese officials </p><p>recognize that conducting such a public campaign would lead </p><p>even the average citizen to wonder if the condition of a </p><p>vast majority of profoundly retarded children, whose </p><p>affliction has been blamed on AO/dioxin, could have been </p><p>avoided easily by pre-emptive remediation of a nutritional </p><p>deficiency.  Here are other examples of easily remediable </p><p>problems that are given insufficient attention, perhaps </p><p>because doing so would undermine the AO/dioxin blame game: </p><p>the high rates of cerebral palsy in the general population </p><p>due to birth injury, the epidemic of liver cancer due to </p><p>chronic active hepatitis because of poor medical practices </p><p>and inadequate blood screening.  Both of these conditions </p><p>are routinely blamed on AO/dioxin.  Parenthetically, we also </p><p>note a similar approach taken to another significant issue </p><p>of disability in Vietnam - the issue of UXO.  The government </p><p>makes every attempt to use this to generate sympathy and </p><p>funding, especially with the international community, and </p><p>often links the two issues of AO/dioxin and UXO together to </p><p>maximize the effect of demonizing the US for the "holocaust" </p><p>of the Vietnam War (a term that is constantly used by the </p><p>GVN and their international sympathizers).  The GVN never </p><p>mentions that much of the UXO resulted from their own </p><p>military and guerilla operations in the affected provinces </p><p>and any attempt to quantify this is always stopped </p><p>immediately. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (SBU) Pending Projects By Which to Gauge Vietnamese </p><p>Attitudes and Intentions: </p><p> </p><p>           a.  (SBU) On 7 February, EST Officer and NIEHS </p><p>officer Dr. William Suk met with the two lead Vietnamese </p><p>scientific investigators in the Danang Soil Sampling Project </p><p>being conducted jointly with U.S. EPA.  Dr. Suk is taking </p><p>the lead in an NIEHS plan to organize a workshop in Vietnam </p><p>to explore new, emerging technologies related to </p><p>environmental assessment and remediation.  This workshop </p><p>would be the first step in the next phase of the Danang </p><p>Project already discussed between EPA and the counterpart </p><p>Vietnamese organization for this project, the National </p><p>Center for Natural Science and Technology (NCST).  The </p><p>Vietnamese investigators were very excited about the </p><p>potential for this workshop, and offered the use of NCST </p><p>facilities.  However, they emphasized that GVN and Committee </p><p>33 approvals would not be automatic.  They expressed </p><p>optimism that Dr. Dang Vu Minh, Director General, NCST (and </p><p>a member of the Communist Party Central Committee and a </p><p>member of the National Assembly), who was tasked by the GVN </p><p>to manage the Danang Project, would support the workshop. </p><p>           b.  (SBU) On 8 February, EST Officer met with Dr. </p><p>David Carpenter, School of Public Health, University of New </p><p>York at Albany, who is the lead U.S. investigator on a joint </p><p>research project with the Hanoi Medical University related </p><p>to effects of AO/Dioxin on pregnancy.  In January 2003, this </p><p>project was approved by NIEHS for a 3-year grant.   NIEHS is </p><p>withholding release of funds pending receipt of formal </p><p>notification that Committee 33 has approved the proposal </p><p>without substantive changes.  Dr. Carpenter was in Hanoi to </p><p>meet with the lead Vietnamese investigator.   (COMMENT: </p><p>Embassy suggests that the IWG seek more details on the </p><p>project from NIEHS.  END COMMENT)  Dr. Carpenter, having </p><p>expected some obstacles related to funding issues, was </p><p>upbeat after his conversations with the Vietnamese </p><p>investigators.  However, as noted in Paragraph 9 above, this </p><p>proposal has not been yet been submitted to Committee 33 for </p><p>approval.  The lead Vietnamese investigator did not mention </p><p>any problems related to obtaining approval for shipment of </p><p>blood samples to the U.S. and predicted approval would be </p><p>granted for the overall project by April 2003.  EST Officer </p><p>and Dr. Carpenter discussed the potential for Committee 33, </p><p>even after granting general approval, to interfere with the </p><p>efficiency of the research.  (BEGIN COMMENT:  On 7 February, </p><p>one of the NCST investigators in the Danang Project, who was </p><p>familiar with the Carpenter project, voiced the opinion that </p><p>Committee 33 would never approve a project which allowed all </p><p>blood samples to be shipped to the U.S. for analysis.  The </p><p>investigator cited ongoing problems (mainly lengthy delays) </p><p>in obtaining Committee 33\'s approval to ship soil samples to </p><p>the U.S. and third countries.  END COMMENT)  Embassy views </p><p>this project to be a litmus test to evaluate the GVN\'s </p><p>willingness to pursue good science and demonstrate its </p><p>intentions towards health research on the AO/dioxin issue. </p><p>This is a pioneer endeavor. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (SBU) The USG must decide how to address the issue of </p><p>scientific cooperation, since it is now clear that the GVN </p><p>is unwilling to engage in any real scientific cooperation </p><p>and will undercut the effort to serve its propaganda </p><p>objectives.  We feel that ignoring this situation will have </p><p>the probable outcome of continued success on the part of the </p><p>Vietnamese in engaging the broader international community </p><p>to exert pressure on the USG to remediate and remunerate all </p><p>the "victims."  The issue is how to address this.  We </p><p>encourage the IWG and others in the USG to focus on this </p><p>issue. </p><p> </p><p>           -- The Vietnamese are succeeding at their </p><p>longstanding propaganda campaign.  We need to counter the </p><p>disinformation with valid, scientifically documented </p><p>information.  We should challenge bogus, slanted journalism </p><p>- both vernacular and international - with factual, </p><p>objective responses that expose the fallacies of the GVN </p><p>propaganda and describe other potential factors that </p><p>contribute to the health problems that the Vietnamese </p><p>attribute solely to AO/dioxin.  Silence or bland, non- </p><p>specific responses will only tend to "confirm" the </p><p>disinformation in the eyes of the audience.  We should </p><p>publicize our efforts to engage and support the Vietnamese </p><p>in joint scientific research, and expose foot dragging </p><p>and/or efforts by the GVN (Committee 33) to stymie the </p><p>progress of a worthwhile project.   We should not hesitate </p><p>to respond to efforts to attribute all maladies to AO/Dioxin </p><p>by noting the large number of Vietnamese who are victims of </p><p>their own government\'s inability to provide them with </p><p>adequate nutrition, quality medical services and protection </p><p>from environmental.  The Embassy cannot accomplish this </p><p>alone.  Our Public Affairs Officer, with support from the </p><p>new HHS officer (not yet selected) who will serve as Embassy </p><p>Health Attach, needs support to deal with Vietnamese </p><p>propaganda campaign and the constant barrage of queries from </p><p>the international media.  Embassy requests that the IWG, </p><p>with support from NIH/NIEHS, prepare a concise summary on </p><p>dioxin, which Embassy and other agencies involved in the </p><p>AO/Dioxin issue can use as a basis for talking points that </p><p>address key questions related to dioxin and what the </p><p>international scientific community knows about it.  Our </p><p>intent is that this would provide sufficient factual, </p><p>objective information that would demonstrate why the USG has </p><p>taken the position that there are many unanswered questions </p><p>about the health effects, and justify our call for further </p><p>scientific research to determine how much, if any, adverse </p><p>impact AO/dioxin has had on health in Vietnam.  In other </p><p>words, we need to be able to counter the Vietnamese position </p><p>that exposure to dioxin, no matter under what circumstances </p><p>and at what levels, eliminates all other possible causes of </p><p>a health problem.  This document would also serve as a </p><p>primer for the uninformed, particularly the press who tend </p><p>to focus solely on the fact that dioxin is a persistent </p><p>organic pollutant linked to health problems. </p><p> </p><p>           -- The Embassy is not advocating that we turn our </p><p>backs on sincere, genuine efforts to pressure the Vietnamese </p><p>to engage in serious scientific research.  We advocate </p><p>continuing a proactive approach to demonstrate to all </p><p>stakeholders that we want the March 10 MOU to be a framework </p><p>for advancing science, not just a piece of signed paper that </p><p>serves as "evidence" for the Vietnamese propaganda machine </p><p>to prove that the U.S. accepted blame for spraying </p><p>herbicides during the war and by default accepted the </p><p>allegations of causing catastrophic damage to the health of </p><p>hundreds thousands of Vietnamese citizens.  Embassy will </p><p>support the U.S. agencies (NIEHS, EPA, CDC) in all phases of </p><p>the Danang Project, including the new initiative on </p><p>exploring remediation technologies, and the health research </p><p>project currently awaiting Committee 33 approval.  We will </p><p>try to "push the right buttons" from the Office to </p><p>Government down to the functional agencies in the Vietnamese </p><p>bureaucracy to keep up pressure for implementation of these </p><p>projects. </p><p> </p><p>           --Embassy expects the soon-to-be assigned Health </p><p>Attach to take the lead in promoting cooperation in health </p><p>research by supporting NIEHS programs and by interacting </p><p>closely with the appropriate counterparts in the Ministry of </p><p>Health and the medical universities. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p></p></div>
