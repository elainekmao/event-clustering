(SBU) The following is a listing of important </p><p>narcotrafficking activities occurring in Honduras within the </p><p>past year.  It should be noted that there has been a sizable </p><p>increase in the use of aircraft as a delivery platform for </p><p>drug shipments.  The occurrence of illicit aircraft tracks </p><p>crossing into Honduras averages three incidents per day. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>AIRCRAFT ACTIVITY </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>-March 31, 2002:  A Beechcraft Queen Air crashed in the </p><p>remote Mosquitia region of Honduras.  Ninety-five AK-47s were </p><p>recovered at this site (ref B). </p><p> </p><p>-August 31, 2002:  Police responded to a crash site in Santa </p><p>Rita of a Piper Seneca (model PA-34-200T) bearing Colombian </p><p>tail number HK-2083P.

No drugs were seized but arrests were made.  An </p><p>Operation Gemini Clipper sticker was located on the aircraft </p><p>that bore the tail number N237H (ref B). </p><p> </p><p>-March 5, 2003:  A twin engine Air Commander believed to be </p><p>transporting 500 to 1,000 kilos of cocaine crashed in the </p><p>area of Kum, Nicaragua; Kum is located just south of the </p><p>Honduran border in the remote region of La Mosquitia.  Local </p><p>villagers are believed to have taken most of the load across </p><p>the Rio Coco into Honduras (ref B). </p><p> </p><p>-March 19, 2003:  A Beechcraft King Air entered southern </p><p>Honduras and continued northwest straddling the Honduran/El </p><p>Salvadoran border before it entered Guatemala where it was </p><p>ultimately forced down.  Two Colombians were arrested and </p><p>1,020 kilos of cocaine were seized (ref B). </p><p> </p><p>-April 2, 2003:  A Colombian-registered (HK-2862P) Piper </p><p>Seneca loaded with cocaine was captured by police after </p><p>landing on a Honduran highway near Arenal, in the Yolo </p><p>department.  The pilots fled the scene leaving Colombian </p><p>flight plans aboard.  Although only 397 kilos of cocaine were </p><p>recovered at the site, it is believed that the plane </p><p>originated with 1,000 kilos onboard (ref B). </p><p> </p><p>-April 8, 2003:  A Beechcraft Queen Air violated Honduran air </p><p>space in the south of the country, but was not intercepted. </p><p>The aircraft was believed to have approximately 1,000 kilos </p><p>of cocaine onboard (ref B). </p><p> </p><p>-April 14, 2003:  The Honduran Air Force forced down an Aero </p><p>Commander over southern Honduras.  The two Colombian pilots </p><p>were killed.  Honduran police collected approximately 942 </p><p>kilos of cocaine from the crash site (refs A, C, and D). </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>MARITIME ACTIVITY </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>-November 29, 2002:  Honduran authorities seized 2.2 kilos of </p><p>cocaine from a go-fast boat on a beach in La Mosquitia. </p><p>During the operation two traffickers were killed, two </p><p>captured, and the remaining two escaped. </p><p> </p><p>-December 11, 2002:  USD 460,000 was seized from F/U "Captain </p><p>Ryan" in La Ceiba, Honduras.

The twelve subjects arrested were in </p><p>possession of 12 hand guns, two AK-47s, one M-16, one GPS and </p><p>13 cell phones.  Some of the individuals arrested in the </p><p>event are known traffickers.  Subsequent investigation </p><p>revealed that they are connected to a prominent </p><p>narcotrafficking family. </p><p>-April 13, 2003:  An abandoned go-fast boat was found in the </p><p>vicinity of Puerto Castilla equipped with three 250 </p><p>horsepower engines and 10 barrels of fuel. </p><p>2. (SBU) Comment:  The events listed above offer only a </p><p>glimpse into the narcotrafficking operations that transit </p><p>Honduras.  Post, through the Political Section\'s INL </p><p>programs, DEA, and TAT, work closely with the GOH on </p><p>combating narcotrafficking.  It is clear to Post that the GOH </p><p>cannot fight this battle without the support of the USG.  End </p><p>Comment. </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
