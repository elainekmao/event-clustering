<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 001218 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/W AND IO </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: 18/04/02 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, NI, UNHRC-1 </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: RESPONSE TO UN RESOLUTION ON CUBA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A.) ABUJA 1164 B.) STATE 64509 C.) STATE 65639 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY CDA ANDREWS FOR REASON 1.5(D) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) MFA Permanent Secretary Hart was surprisingly </p><p>open to the possibility of a Nigerian abstention after </p><p>hearing our points April 17.  Hart agreed that the </p><p>language was mild, saying, "Cuba should have nothing </p><p>to fear" from it."  He said that he would discuss the </p><p>resolution with Foreign Minister Lamido when he </p><p>returned from Dakar. Hart also planned to contact </p><p>Nigeria\'s Ambassador in Geneva. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Hart was particularly interested in the degree </p><p>of support the resolution had within GRULAC.  Embassy </p><p>April 18 sent him a second copy of the resolution, </p><p>with co-sponsors appended, under cover of a Note </p><p>requesting Nigeria to vote "yes" on Friday. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Hart told us afternoon of April 18 that </p><p>Nigeria\'s Ambassador in Geneva had not returned his </p><p>telephone call from mid-morning.  The original </p><p>instructions had been to vote in line with Nigerian </p><p>practice (i.e., against the resolution), but there had </p><p>been a discussion with Lamido and others following our </p><p>demarche (para one) and receipt of our Note.  It had </p><p>been agreed that the Uruguayan draft offered an </p><p>approach to Cuba new enough that further study was </p><p>merited.  Hart said someone from his office was </p><p>enroute to Geneva and that he would speak with that </p><p>officer evening of April 18 if Nigeria\'s Ambassador </p><p>did not return his call in the interim.  The </p><p>Ambassador, said Hart, had been asked to consult with </p><p>the Kenyan, Senegalese and Sierra Leonean delegations, </p><p>as well as to report on Latin sentiment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) COMMENT: Nigeria\'s Ambassador is Geneva was </p><p>provided instructions based on the GON\'s experience </p><p>with past Cuba resolutions.  We do not know whether he </p><p>is playing a useful or negative role.  The knowledge </p><p>that he has not returned Hart\'s call leaves us ill at </p><p>ease, notwithstanding Hart\'s comment that the </p><p>Ambassador is doubtless very busy with his leading </p><p>role in the African Group.  Clearly, there is at least </p><p>some thought in Abuja of abstaining, but Nigeria\'s </p><p>Ambassador -- perhaps having staked out a position in </p><p>the African Group that he does not want to give up -- </p><p>appears not to be engaging in that dialogue with his </p><p>capital.  We have no objection to USDEL informing </p><p>Nigeria\'s Ambassador that Embassy Abuja has held </p><p>fruitful discussions with very senior levels of the </p><p>GON and encouraging him to call home.  We would </p><p>strongly encourage USDEL to motivate supportive </p><p>members of GRULAC to approach the Nigerian delegation </p><p>and urge Nigeria to take the lead within the African </p><p>Group and vote "yes."  We have intimated in our </p><p>conversations, but not stated directly, that the </p><p>Latins are doing on Cuba what Africa should be doing </p><p>through NePAD and that the wishes of the responsible </p><p>regional group deserve respect. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ANDREWS </p><p></p></div>
