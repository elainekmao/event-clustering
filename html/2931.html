<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001140 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>AF/PD FOR COX AND ROBERTSON, AF/S FOR KRAFT AND SCHLACHTER, </p><p>AF/RA FOR DIPALMA, INR/R/MR, NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ZI, PREL, PHUM </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REPORT MUGABE\'S VISIT TO THE UN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.   Under the headline "\'Smart sanctions fail\': Ban </p><p>   imposed on Zimbabwe\'s leadership has failed to work: </p><p>   Mudenge," the government-owned daily "Herald" offers the </p><p>   official view of President Mugabe\'s May 8-12 visit to UN </p><p>   headquarters in New York.  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>2.   "President Mugabe\'s visit to the UN in New York last </p><p>   week means that the so-called smart sanctions imposed on </p><p>   Zimbabwe\'s leadership have failed to work, the Minister </p><p>   of Foreign Affairs Stan Mudenge, said yesterday. . . </p><p>   The U.S. and the EU imposed the so-called targeted </p><p>   sanctions, which are supposed to ban President Mugabe </p><p>   and his entire Cabinet from visiting the U.S. and EU </p><p>   member countries.  Yet the President and the First Lady; </p><p>   as well as the Minister of Youth Development, Gender and </p><p>   Employment Creation, Elliot Manyika, spent close to a </p><p>   week in New York and their movements were not restricted </p><p>   at all.  A spokesman for Zimbabwe\'s Permanent Mission to </p><p>   the UN, Mr. Emmanuel Gumbo, dismissed media reports that </p><p>   Mugabe\'s movements were restricted as mischievous.  He </p><p>   said the President had \'25 green lights ahead of him to </p><p>   travel anywhere he wishes in the United States. . . .\'" </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
