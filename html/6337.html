<p>UNCLAS ANKARA 001623 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE ALSO FOR E, EB/IFD AND EUR/SE </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA - MILLS AND LEICHTER </p><p>NSC FOR QUANRUD AND BRYZA </p><p>USDOC FOR 4212/ITA/MAC/OEURA/DDEFALCO </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EINV, ECON, PGOV, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY STILL STRUGGLING TO IMPROVE INVESTMENT </p><p>ENVIRONMENT </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary:  Treasury Director General for Foreign </p><p>Investments Melek Us told us March 13 that the lack of </p><p>high-level direction over the past several months has stymied </p><p>the bureaucracy\'s ability to take decisions needed to improve </p><p>the foreign investment environment.  The government has </p><p>submitted a draft bill to improve the investment environment, </p><p>and soon will send forward a bill to create an investment </p><p>promotion agency.  However, Us admitted that foreign </p><p>investors were unlikely to look seriously at Turkey until the </p><p>Iraq "crisis" passes and the GOT convinces would-be investors </p><p>that it is committed to full implementation of its reform </p><p>program.  As a result, 2003 probably will not see significant </p><p>investment inflows, though it would not take much to surpass </p><p>2002\'s amazingly low total of $569 million.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Treasury Director General for Foreign Investment </p><p>Melek Us provided EconCouns with an update March 13 on the </p><p>government\'s efforts to improve the foreign direct investment </p><p>environment.  She acknowledged that there had been little </p><p>progress in the past six months, as bureaucrats put off </p><p>decisions due to uncertainty, first over the elections, and </p><p>subsequently over how long the Gul government would last. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Us said the interagency committee set up under the </p><p>previous government to propose measures to improve the </p><p>investment environment had finally met last week, after a </p><p>nearly five month hiatus.  The committee, chaired by State </p><p>Minister Ali Babacan, agreed to recommend to the government </p><p>that it submit legislation to create a new investment </p><p>promotion agency.  The agency, Us explained, would not be a </p><p>one-stop shop.  Rather, its mission would be to explain to </p><p>potential investors all the steps involved in investing in </p><p>Turkey, help then should they run into problems, and -- most </p><p>importantly -- market Turkey internationally as a good place </p><p>to invest. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Us admitted that this was not a propitious time to </p><p>try to "sell" Turkey to foreign investors.  Investors will </p><p>only begin to look at Turkey seriously, she said, once the </p><p>Iraq situation was resolved and the government demonstrated a </p><p>firm commitment to economic reform.  In the meantime, the </p><p>bureaucracy -- working with the private sector -- will try to </p><p>improve the legislative framework.  She expects Parliament to </p><p>pass both the investment promotion bill and long-pending </p><p>foreign investment legislation (an IMF condition) by </p><p>end-April.  Also, the government has submitted a new mining </p><p>law to Parliament; the only problem, per Us, is that no one </p><p>likes the draft, which apparently puts severe restrictions on </p><p>foreign investment in mining. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) In addition, the government is planning to issue </p><p>decrees to ease restrictions on land use for investors. </p><p>Starting January 1, 2004, the government will shift to an </p><p>inflation accounting system (the lack of which has been a </p><p>huge subject of complaint), and to an automatic, uniform </p><p>mechanism for granting tax allowances to foreign investors </p><p>(so they will not need to obtain a Treasury certificate to </p><p>obtain the allowance). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  EconCouns noted the importance of resolving </p><p>problems facing existing investors, and mentioned as examples </p><p>Cargill\'s land problem, the sugar quota, the cola tax, the </p><p>lack of effective IPR protection, and recent government </p><p>efforts to force energy companies to lower their prices.  Us </p><p>agreed, and admitted that the government was facing great </p><p>difficulty in resolving these problems.  She noted, for </p><p>example, that there was a consensus among the relevant </p><p>ministries in favor of finding a solution to Cargill\'s land </p><p>problem, but that nonetheless the government had not been </p><p>able to find such a solution.  She noted that Turkey\'s </p><p>constitution -- not just ordinary law -- prohibited </p><p>conversion of "first degree" agricultural land into </p><p>industrial land. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) Comment;  The outlook for FDI inflows in 2003 is </p><p>not rosy, though the second-half of the year could see some </p><p>improvement if the Iraq issue is resolved and the government </p><p>successfully implements its economic program, including some </p><p>major priviatzations.  In any case, it will be hard for </p><p>Turkey to attract less investment this year than it did in </p><p>2002, when inflows totaled an incredibly low $569 million. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
