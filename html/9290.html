<p>UNCLAS AMMAN 004189 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, KDEM, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: ISLAMIC ACTION FRONT TO PARTICIPATE IN AMMAN </p><p>MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS, BOYCOTT ALL OTHER POLLS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>1.  The Islamic Action Front (IAF) declared 2 July that it </p><p>would participate in municipal elections on 26 July but only </p><p>for seats in the Greater Amman Municipality (GAM).  IAF plans </p><p>to boycott all other municipal polls. </p><p> </p><p>2.  IAF Secretary-General Hamzeh Mansour announced the </p><p>boycott in protest of the &recent amendment to the Municipal </p><p>Elections Law that permits the Prime Ministry to appoint </p><p>mayors and up to half of municipalities, council members.8 </p><p>When questioned over the IAF,s participation in the capital, </p><p>Mansour explained that the GAM election law has, since its </p><p>adoption 16 years ago, provided for the appointment of some </p><p>members.  The only way he foresees changing the law is </p><p>through direct involvement in the capital,s governmental </p><p>affairs.  IAF believes all council members and the mayor of </p><p>GAM should be elected by popular vote and that the current </p><p>structure is &undemocratic.8 </p><p> </p><p>3.  Two years ago, GOJ implemented a significant structural </p><p>transformation program targeting municipal governing bodies. </p><p>328 municipalities were merged into 99 larger districts in an </p><p>effort to reduce costs and reform the work-force.  The </p><p>reform-oriented Municipal, Rural, and Environment Affairs </p><p>Minister, Abdul Razzaq Tbeishat, defended the amendment, </p><p>suggesting that it was implemented to connect those </p><p>&qualified to offer citizens efficient municipal services8 </p><p>with their elected counterparts. </p><p> </p><p>4.  IAF, the political wing of the pan-Islamic Muslim </p><p>Brotherhood, is the government,s leading opposition party. </p><p>It holds 18 seats in the new 110-member lower house of </p><p>parliament that will convene 15 July.  Two years ago, 80 IAF </p><p>members serving as mayors and council members resigned in </p><p>protest of the government,s merger program. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  Comment:  A more likely reason for IAF,s </p><p>participation only in Amman municipality is its relatively </p><p>greater success in Amman in the recent Parliamentary polls. </p><p>IAF did well in Amman races, winning as much as 49 percent of </p><p>the vote, according to some analysts.  It fared far less well </p><p>in rural and tribal areas.  The IAF boycott of municipal </p><p>polls outside Amman is likely designed to make a good showing </p><p>in the capital without risking defeat in the provinces. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
