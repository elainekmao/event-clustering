HOWEVER, </p><p>FUNCTIONING (THOUGH UNRATIFIED) BORDER REPATRIATION </p><p>ARRANGEMENTS WITH ITS NEIGHBORS AND OUR CONTINUING </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS WITH ZIMBABWE ON AN EXTRADITION TREATY </p><p>INDICATE ZIMBABWE WOULD ACT RESPONSIBLY IN A CASE </p><p>INVOLVING INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>D.
