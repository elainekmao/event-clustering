Officials from the State </p><p>Airports Administration (DHMI) in Adana said DHMI was </p><p>exerting efforts to complete the renovation project </p><p>within the stated period of time and re-open it on </p><p>December 31.  Contracting firm, MON, which won the </p><p>bidding tender, has begun to remove the asphalt of the </p><p>2,750-meter runway.  The estimated cost of the project </p><p>is TL 6.8 trillion (approx. USD 4.1 million). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  VILLAGE RETURN PROJECT </p><p>(Milli Gazete/Turkiye)  The Siirt Governor\'s Office </p><p>reportedly placed weight on the Village Return Project </p><p>in Siirt following the restoration of calm in the </p><p>Southeast.  Under the project, infrastructure services </p><p>have been completed in residential areas and </p><p>centralized villages, with residential units </p><p>constructed in Eruh\'s (Siirt) Cizmeli village opened </p><p>to evacuees\' settlement.  Governor Nuri Okutan said he </p><p>had mobilized all resources to implement the project, </p><p>of which 80% has been completed.  "There is quite a </p><p>high demand for returns in our region," Okutan added. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ECONOMIC AND AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENTS </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.

Nearly </p><p>another 40 merchants are preparing to close down. </p><p>Guroymak Merchants and Artisans Chamber President </p><p>Fedai Erdanis said dozens of merchants had applied to </p><p>the chamber to de-register.

ADANA BUSINESSMEN OPTIMISTIC ABOUT NEW GOVERNMENT </p><p>(Bolge)  The board of directors of the Adana Chamber </p><p>of Commerce emphasized the importance of the positive </p><p>environment created by the one-party government </p><p>formula that came out of the November 3 elections in </p><p>terms of solving problems facing Adana, as well as </p><p>Turkey.  They described the outcome as a big </p><p>opportunity.  "People have displayed their attitudes </p><p>toward the coalition governments by giving AKP the </p><p>ability to form a single-party government by itself </p><p>due to what was experienced during the last (outgoing) </p><p>government\'s period. </p><p>HOLTZ </p><p></p></div>
