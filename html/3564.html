(U)  CLASSIFIED BY POL/C SCOTT BELLARD; REASON 1.5(D) </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  02079  230926Z </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  IN TWO SEPARATE CONVERSATIONS ON AUGUST 20 AND 21, </p><p>THREE OF HANOI\'S LEADING DEMOCRACY ACTIVISTS TOLD POLOFF </p><p>THAT THEY VIEW GENERAL TRAN DO\'S AUGUST 14 FUNERAL AS AN </p><p>"HISTORIC POLITICAL EVENT" HIGHLIGHTING THE NATIONAL </p><p>LEADERSHIP\'S DISTANCE FROM THE PEOPLE.  DESPITE A NEAR- </p><p>TOTAL LACK OF ADVANCE PUBLICITY, BETWEEN ONE AND TWO </p><p>THOUSAND PEOPLE ATTENDED THE FUNERAL, ACCORDING TO DR. </p><p>NGUYEN THANH GIANG.  THEY INCLUDED MANY "REGULAR PEOPLE AND </p><p>VETERANS" AND "OLD PARTY MEMBERS," SAID ACTIVIST AND AUTHOR </p><p>HOANG TIEN ON AUGUST 20. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  PHAM QUE DUONG, DR. GIANG, AND TIEN (PLEASE </p><p>PROTECT) WERE ALL DISMISSIVE OF THE HIGHEST-RANKING </p><p>OFFICIAL REPRESENTATIVE AT THE FUNERAL, NATIONAL ASSEMBLY </p><p>FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN AND CPV CENTRAL </p><p>COMMITTEE MEMBER VU MAO.  THEY COMPLAINED THAT IT WAS </p><p>"INSULTING" THAT A POLITBURO MEMBER HAD NOT BEEN PRESENT. </p><p>TIEN NOTED THAT SENTIMENT IN THE CROWD AGAINST THE GVN\'S </p><p>AND CPV\'S HANDLING OF THE FUNERAL WAS REMARKABLY </p><p>WIDESPREAD.  DR. GIANG DESCRIBED HOW EVEN SOME OF "THE OLD </p><p>PARTY MEMBERS" AT THE FUNERAL HAD BEGUN BEHAVING AS IF THEY </p><p>WERE AT A DEMONSTRATION, PUMPING THEIR FISTS IN THE AIR IN </p><p>APPARENT ANGER AT THE CPV\'S AND GVN\'S "SHABBY TREATMENT" OF </p><p>GENERAL DO.  IT SHOWED A LACK OF RESPECT TOWARD A MAN MANY </p><p>REGARDED AS A NATIONAL HERO, GOING AGAINST VIETNAMESE </p><p>CULTURE AND TRADITION, GIANG AND TIEN SEPARATELY NOTED. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  TIEN HAS WRITTEN A SHARPLY CRITICAL TRACT ABOUT </p><p>THE FUNERAL ENTITLED "THE SOUND OF CLAPPING AT A FUNERAL" </p><p>(SEPTEL WILL PROVIDE TRANSLATION).  HE AND FELLOW ACTIVISTS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02079  230926Z </p><p>PHAM QUE DUONG AND VAN KHAC KHIN ARE IN THE PROCESS OF </p><p>DISTRIBUTING COPIES TO TOP GVN AND CPV OFFICIALS AS WELL AS </p><p>TO OTHER ACTIVISTS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  ACCORDING TO DUONG, THERE WERE POLICE BARRICADES </p><p>AROUND THE FUNERAL HALL.  HE EXPRESSED DOUBT THAT ANY </p><p>FOREIGNERS, MUCH LESS A US EMBASSY OFFICIAL, WOULD HAVE </p><p>BEEN ALLOWED TO ATTEND, ALTHOUGH HE SAID THAT HE SAW A FEW </p><p>FOREIGN JOURNALISTS OUTSIDE THE BARRICADES. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)   DR. GIANG DISCUSSED THE FUNERAL WITH POLOFF IN </p><p>THE PRESENCE OF ANOTHER MAN WHOM HE SIMPLY CALLED "ONG" (A </p><p>PRONOUN OF RESPECT) KHANH.  KHANH CLAIMED TO BE A </p><p>"REVOLUTIONARY" AND CPV MEMBER BEGINNING IN 1944 AS WELL AS </p><p>AN ASSISTANT TO THEN-POLITBURO MEMBER TRAN XUAN BACH. </p><p>(NOTE:  BACH WAS ELECTED TO THE POLITBURO AT THE SIXTH </p><p>PARTY CONGRESS IN 1986.  END NOTE.)   DR. GIANG SAID THAT </p><p>THE POLICE "DID NOT DARE" TO DO ANYTHING TO ELDERLY CPV </p><p>MEMBERS SUCH AS KHANH BECAUSE OF THEIR STATURE, AND CLAIMED </p><p>THAT KHANH REPRESENTED AN OLDER GENERATION OF CPV MEMBERS </p><p>THAT QUIETLY AGREES WITH THE DEMOCRACY ACTIVISTS.  DR. </p><p>GIANG REMARKED THAT VIETNAMESE YOUTH DO NOT PAY MUCH </p><p>ATTENTION EITHER TO THE CPV OR TO DEMOCRACY ACTIVISTS, BUT </p><p>OPINED THAT THEY "LIKED" THE DEMOCRACY ACTIVISTS MORE. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  THERE WAS LIMITED BUT RESPECTFUL COVERAGE IN MAJOR </p><p>VIETNAMESE NEWSPAPERS ABOUT TRAN DO\'S DEATH (BUT NOT ABOUT </p><p>HIS FUNERAL, AS FAR AS WE CAN ASCERTAIN), WHILE OMITTING </p><p>ANY DISCUSSION ABOUT HIS FALL-OUT WITH AND EVENTUAL </p><p>EXPULSION FROM THE PARTY IN HIS LATER YEARS. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02079  230926Z </p><p>8.  (C)  COMMENT:  EMBASSY AGREES WITH THE ASSESSMENT OF </p><p>THESE ACTIVISTS THAT THEY ARE UNLIKELY TO BE ALONE WITHIN </p><p>ELITE CIRCLES IN RESENTING THE TREATMENT OF GENERAL TRAN DO </p><p>BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER HIS DEATH.  WE NONETHELESS DO NOT </p><p>EXPECT ANY STRONG GVN RESPONSE -- APART FROM A POSSIBLE NEW </p><p>ROUND OF QUESTIONING AND/OR HEIGHTENED PETTY HARASSMENT -- </p><p>AGAINST THEM EVEN AFTER THE DISTRIBUTION OF TIEN\'S TRACT. </p><p>CPV AND GVN SENSITIVITIES ABOUT TRAN DO\'S UNIQUE STATURE </p><p>AND HISTORY, AS WELL AS SOME POSSIBLE TACIT SYMPATHIES </p><p>WITHIN THE CPV TOWARD DO\'S CRITICISMS, LIKELY WILL MAKE IT </p><p>DIFFICULT TO ARRIVE AT A SENIOR-LEVEL CONSENSUS ON ANY </p><p>LARGER CAMPAIGN OF RETALIATION OR ANY NEW CRACKDOWN AGAINST </p><p>DEMOCRACY ACTIVISTS. </p><p>PORTER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
