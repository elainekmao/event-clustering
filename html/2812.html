<p>UNCLAS HARARE 000973 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>AF/PD FOR COX AND ROBERTSON, AF/S FOR KRAFT AND </p><p>SCHLACHTER, AF/RA, INR/R/MR, NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ZI, PREL, PHUM </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION MEP; HARARE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.   Under headline "Israeli attacks on civilians </p><p>   abhorrent," the government-controlled daily "The </p><p>   Herald" dedicated its April 23 editorial to calling for </p><p>   the cessation of the "cycle of violence and counter- </p><p>   violence" in the Middle East.  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>2.   ". . .No rational person can condone or support </p><p>   the </p><p>   random killings of Israeli civilians by suicide </p><p>   bombers.  These are acts of terrorism.  But the </p><p>   Israeli solution, an attack on the civilians of </p><p>   Palestine, cannot, for the same reasons, be </p><p>   condoned or supported.  And, looking at how </p><p>   effective the action launched three weeks ago will </p><p>   be, we doubt that there will be any let up in the </p><p>   counter-terror attacks on Israeli civilians. </p><p>   Indeed, we expect there will be more such attacks. </p><p>   There is an urgent need to end this cycle of </p><p>   violence and counter-violence.  Israel\'s incredibly </p><p>   powerful war machine can obviously send troops </p><p>   anywhere in the occupied territories and can </p><p>   destroy whatever it wishes, and kill whomever it </p><p>   targets.  But it cannot destroy or kill the desire </p><p>   of the Palestinians for a state of their own, </p><p>   especially when such a state appears to be the only </p><p>   way they can live a normal life. </p><p> </p><p>   ". . .We believe that peace can come to Israel and </p><p>   Palestine.  But, as in Northern Ireland, South </p><p>   Africa and other places where dispute centered on </p><p>   religious and ethnic grounds, tremendous moral </p><p>   leadership must be exerted by the religious </p><p>   leaders.  Jewish rabbis the world over need to take </p><p>   a stand on principle, and tell the Israeli </p><p>   government that it cannot betray the core beliefs </p><p>   and tribulations that led to the establishment of </p><p>   Israel in the first place.  Palestinian imams and </p><p>   bishops have to explain that sometimes forgiveness </p><p>   is the only option God gives us.  There is still a </p><p>   chance that what is needed - two states, alike in </p><p>   dignity and living together in peace - can be </p><p>   achieved.  But that needs men and women of highest </p><p>   moral courage to stand up for peace and honor for </p><p>   all." </p><p> </p><p>WHITEHEAD </p><p></p></div>
