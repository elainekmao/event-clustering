<p>S E C R E T RANGOON 000838 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/10/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, BM, Ethnics, Human Rights </p><p>SUBJECT: ETHNIC LEADERS PLAN APPEAL TO LEADER OF JUNTA </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: COM CARMEN MARTINEZ FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (S)  Summary: Reverend Saboi Jum, the head of the Kachin </p><p>Baptist Convention, has revealed plans by ethnic leaders to </p><p>appeal directly to the head of the SPDC for a return to the </p><p>path of national reconciliation. Jum asked COM if the release </p><p>of Aung San Suu Kyi alone  would be enough to ease US </p><p>pressure on the junta. COM told Jum that the release of Aung </p><p>San Suu Kyi was important, but not enough to ease USG </p><p>pressure for release of all political prisoners, improved </p><p>human rights for all Burmese, and credible signs of </p><p>commitment to a transition to democracy. Given Jum\'s </p><p>closeness to the SPDC\'s Secretary One Khin Nyunt, it was an </p><p>excellent opportunity to reinforce the USG message. End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) Reverend Saboi Jum, the head of the Kachin Baptist </p><p>Convention and one of the most respected ethnic leaders in </p><p>Burma met with COM and DCM on July 9.  Jum and his brother, </p><p>Hkun Myat (a businessman) are both very close to the number </p><p>three man in the SPDC, Secretary One, General Khin Nyunt. </p><p>(Note: Jum played a vital part in negotiating the Kachin </p><p>cease-fire agreement, as did Khin Nyunt. Hkun Myat also </p><p>assisted in mediating cease-fire agreements with Karenni, Mon </p><p>and Karen insurgent groups. End Note) </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) Jum\'s stated purpose at the meeting was to reveal </p><p>plans by ethnic leaders to appeal directly to Senior General </p><p>Than Shwe (head of the ruling SPDC junta) for a return to the </p><p>path of national reconciliation.  Jum said that a decision </p><p>was taken by group of ethnic leaders earlier this month to </p><p>draft a letter to Senior General Than Shwe appealing to him </p><p>to allow renewed political activity on the part of the NLD, a </p><p>release of political prisoners, and the release of Aung San </p><p>Suu Kyi. </p><p> </p><p>4. (S) Jum said the letter would be given to Than Shwe on </p><p>July 19, Martyrs Day (commemorating the assassination of </p><p>General Aung San - Burma\'s national hero and the father of </p><p>Aung San Suu Kyi).  Jum said he was confident the letter </p><p>would actually be delivered to Than Shwe, as Jum is very </p><p>close to a monk that is a personal aide to the Senior </p><p>General.  (Jum said he would provide COM with a copy of the </p><p>letter.) </p><p> </p><p>5. (S) Jum asked if the USG\'s tough position on trade </p><p>sanctions and punitive measures against the regime could be </p><p>softened by the release of Aung San Suu Kyi.  He specifically </p><p>asked, "So, if they release Aung San Suu Kyi, would that be </p><p>enough for the United States?"  COM told Jum that the release </p><p>of ASSK was extremely important and should take place </p><p>immediately, but that the USG remained committed to the </p><p>resolution of the even larger problem of the SPDC\'s failure </p><p>to live up to its stated commitment to national </p><p>reconciliation.  The COM told Jum that the USG would not ease </p><p>up its pressure for release of all political prisoners, </p><p>improved human rights for all Burmese and credible signs of </p><p>commitment to a transition to democracy. </p><p> </p><p>6. (S) Comment: We feel strongly that Jum was on a mission </p><p>from not just the ethnic leaders re the planned appeal to </p><p>Than Shwe, but also from Khin Nyunt.  Jum seemed disappointed </p><p>by COM\'s response to his question regarding the "softening" </p><p>effect ASSK\'s release would have on the USG\'s toughening </p><p>Burma policy.  Given Jum\'s closeness to Secretary One, it was </p><p>an excellent opportunity to reinforce the USG message via </p><p>this channel.  End Comment. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
