<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 HANOI 001487 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV; S/CT; S; USPACOM FOR J-3; J06 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  NA </p><p>TAGS: PTER, ASEC, PREL, OTRA, VM, ASEAN, CTERR </p><p>SUBJECT: U.S. CT WORK PLAN FOR ASEAN ACCEPTED IN </p><p>PRINCIPLE </p><p>--          BY THIRD ANNUAL ASEAN SOMTC </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  SUMMARY:  The U.S. and ASEAN member states </p><p>agreed to accept in principle a U.S.-proposed </p><p>counterterrorism Work Plan at the ASEAN-U.S. Senior </p><p>Officials Meeting on Transnational Crime (SOMTC).  While </p><p>final approval of the Work Plan, probably as part of the </p><p>formal Summary Record, will take two weeks, ASEAN intends </p><p>to point to acceptance of the Work Plan as a major </p><p>achievement of the Hanoi SOMTC at the Phnom Penh ASEAN </p><p>Post-Ministerial Conference on June 19, 2003.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  State Department Coordinator for </p><p>Counterterrorism Cofer Black led a USG delegation </p><p>comprised of S/CT officers and representatives from EAP </p><p>and USPACOM to Hanoi, Vietnam, for the ASEAN-U.S. portion </p><p>of the Third Annual ASEAN Senior Officials Meeting on </p><p>Transnational Crime.  The stated goal of the ASEAN-U.S. </p><p>SOMTC was to operationalize the ASEAN-U.S. Joint </p><p>Declaration for Cooperation to Combat International </p><p>Terrorism signed August 2002 in Brunei. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  In response to potential areas of cooperation </p><p>identified in the 2002 ASEAN-U.S. Declaration, the U.S. </p><p>circulated a draft work plan in advance of the SOMTC. </p><p>The five categories outlined in the U.S. Work Plan are: </p><p>Information Sharing; Enhancing Liaison Relationships; </p><p>Capacity Building through Training and Education; </p><p>Transportation, Border, and Immigration Control; and </p><p>Compliance with UN and International Conventions.  Full </p><p>text of draft Work Plan, with text agreed to in </p><p>principle, follows para 6 below. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  In discussing the Work Plan, Indonesia raised </p><p>for consideration additional areas in which the U.S. </p><p>might provide assistance, including countering chemical </p><p>and biological terrorism, providing hardware and software </p><p>to combat cyber crime, and delivering technical </p><p>assistance to combat narcotics and arms trafficking.  The </p><p>U.S. delegation concurred on the importance of these </p><p>issues, and agreed to the possibility of examining these </p><p>issues in future SOMTCs. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  After several sidebar discussions with the </p><p>ASEAN Secretariat staff and comment from member states </p><p>noted above, both the U.S. and ASEAN member states agreed </p><p>to accept in principle the U.S.-proposed Work Plan.  The </p><p>ASEAN Secretariat must send a draft Summary Record, which </p><p>includes the Work Plan, to ASEAN capitals for detailed </p><p>review and comment.  This process is expected to take </p><p>approximately two weeks, and transmittal to the U.S. of </p><p>the formal Summary Record will take place one week later, </p><p>circa July 4.  Formal processes notwithstanding, both </p><p>sides are expected to refer to the Work Plan as the way </p><p>forward at the Phnom Penh ASEAN Post-Ministerial </p><p>Conference on June 19, 2003. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  Note: Brackets below indicate text that is </p><p>pending approval before June 18 ARF meeting. </p><p> </p><p>TEXT ENDORSED IN PRINCIPLE </p><p>WITH AMENDMENTS AT SOMTC+U.S. CONSULTATIONS </p><p>13 June 2003 </p><p>ASEAN-U.S. Counterterrorism Work Plan </p><p>U.S.-ASEAN CT Meeting </p><p>Hanoi, June 13, 2003 </p><p>--Consistent with the "ASEAN-U.S. Joint Declaration for </p><p>Cooperation to Combat International Terrorism," signed in </p><p>Bandar Seri Bagawan on August 1, 2002, ASEAN and its </p><p>member states and the U.S. have enhanced their </p><p>cooperation to meet the challenge to peace and security </p><p>presented by international terrorism.  Together, ASEAN </p><p>and its member states and the U.S., have taken steps, </p><p>both through multilateral and bilateral channels, to: </p><p>- improve intelligence and terrorist finance information </p><p>sharing; </p><p>- enhance liaison relationships among law enforcement </p><p>agencies; </p><p>- strengthen "capacity building" in order to respond to </p><p>transportation, border and immigration control </p><p>challenges; and </p><p>- stem the flow of terrorist-related material, money and </p><p>people. </p><p> </p><p>Significant progress has also been achieved in legal </p><p>matters through the revision of national laws to meet </p><p>international standards and as additional states comply </p><p>with relevant UN Security Council resolutions. As called </p><p>for in UN Security Council Resolution 1373 and the Joint </p><p>Declaration, member states have become parties to more of </p><p>the twelve international conventions and protocols </p><p>relating to terrorism. We welcome these positive steps to </p><p>combat the terrorist threat within and across national </p><p>boundaries and look forward to additional achievements </p><p>both with ASEAN and with its members. </p><p> </p><p>The participants in the Declaration should continue to </p><p>strengthen and expand their cooperation to combat </p><p>international terrorism in the areas identified in the </p><p>ASEAN-U.S. Declaration. Since the signature of the </p><p>Declaration, the United States has initiated or planned </p><p>programs to address many of the items outlined in the non- </p><p>paper on "Potential Areas for Cooperation among ASEAN and </p><p>the United States." </p><p> </p><p>In addition to the extensive cooperation currently or </p><p>expected to be underway, the United States suggests that the </p><p>participants focus on the following new items under the </p><p>"Areas of Cooperation" identified in the 2002 ASEAN-U.S. </p><p>Declaration. </p><p> </p><p> I.  Information Sharing. </p><p> In response to the terrorism section of the May 2002 </p><p>ASEAN Trans-National Crime Work Program and to the </p><p>references to "capacity building in national counter- </p><p>terrorism operations and systems" and to "disaster </p><p>management in the event of terrorist attacks" mentioned </p><p>in ""Potential Areas for Cooperation among ASEAN and the </p><p>United States," the United States expects to consider </p><p>means to facilitate efforts to improve communication </p><p>systems among ASEAN member nations and the ASEAN </p><p>Secretariat, in order to enhance crisis management </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>capabilities. </p><p> </p><p>II. Enhance Liaison Relationships. </p><p> To help realize the 2001 ASEAN Joint Action on Terrorism </p><p>Declaration\'s call to strengthen ASEAN\'s institutional </p><p>role in the fight against terrorism and to improve the </p><p>transparency of plans and programs of international and </p><p>regional organizations designed to combat terrorism, the </p><p>United States: </p><p> - supports strengthened cooperation between ASEAN and the </p><p>United Nations Counterterrorism Committee, the APEC </p><p>Counterterrorism Task Force, the G-8 Counterterrorism </p><p>Action Group established at the Summit in Evian, France, </p><p>the Pacific Islands Forum and other relevant </p><p>organizations. </p><p> - would be prepared to consider financial assistance for </p><p>the ASEAN Secretariat to enhance these types of </p><p>relationships. </p><p> </p><p>III. Capacity Building through Training and Education </p><p> </p><p>-  The United States would be prepared to consider </p><p>further assistance to member countries to develop the </p><p>legal, financial regulatory, financial intelligence, law </p><p>enforcement, and other capabilities and institutions to </p><p>effectively combat terrorist financing. </p><p> </p><p>- In response to the 2002 ASEAN Trans-national Crime Work </p><p>Program and in conjunction with facilitating enhanced </p><p>communications capabilities as noted in I. Information </p><p>Sharing, the United States would be prepared to consider </p><p>sharing technology and information for the production of </p><p>local, national, and regional consequence management and </p><p>disaster preparedness plans. </p><p> </p><p>IV. Transportation, Border, and Immigration Control </p><p> </p><p>The United States shares the concerns of ASEAN states, as </p><p>expressed in the 2002 ASEAN Trans-national Crime Work </p><p>Program (start bracket) and the Anti-Piracy Statement to </p><p>be adopted at the June 18 ASEAN Regional Forum </p><p>Ministerial (end bracket,) that sea piracy and other </p><p>threats to maritime security are of particular interest </p><p>to the region. Accordingly, the U.S. is prepared to </p><p>facilitate the efforts of ASEAN or individual members to </p><p>enhance maritime security. </p><p> </p><p>In response to references to sea piracy and other </p><p>maritime crime in "Potential Areas for Cooperation in </p><p>Combating International Terrorism among ASEAN and the </p><p>United States," possible assistance to meet this </p><p>challenge might include </p><p> - a registry of available maritime counter-terrorism </p><p>training </p><p>- additional training through relevant U.S. government </p><p>agencies, particularly to enhance communications </p><p>capabilities, and: </p><p>- in cooperation with other regional states, advice and </p><p>assistance to ASEAN states, as appropriate, to enhance </p><p>their capabilities to combat terrorism and piracy at sea. </p><p>- The U.S. would consider sharing its experience in </p><p>combating maritime narcotics trafficking multilaterally </p><p>in other regions. </p><p>V. Become party to and comply with UN and International </p><p>Conventions </p><p> </p><p>(Start bracket) The ARF Statement on Cooperation Against </p><p>Piracy and Other Threats to Maritime Security, which </p><p>ASEAN Regional Forum participants are expected to approve </p><p>at the upcoming ASEAN Regional Forum Ministerial, calls </p><p>for all states to become party to and comply with the </p><p>Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against </p><p>the Safety of Maritime Navigation 1988 and the Protocol </p><p>for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety </p><p>of Fixed Platforms on the Continental Shelf, 1988 (SUA </p><p>Convention and its Protocol)(end bracket). </p><p> </p><p>The ASEAN Secretariat\'s information paper on "Potential </p><p>Areas for Cooperation in Combating International </p><p>Terrorism Among ASEAN and the United States" calls for </p><p>the "effective implementation of counter-terrorism </p><p>related conventions." </p><p> </p><p>The United States, in cooperation with other regional </p><p>states, is prepared to assist parties to the SUA </p><p>Convention and its Protocol to implement fully both </p><p>instruments as needed, including but not limited to </p><p>assistance by providing model legislation and law </p><p>enforcement training. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU)  Ambassador Black, as well as EAP/Percival and </p><p>PACOM, have read and cleared this telegram. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p></p></div>
