<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 000534 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CAIRO POL FOR MAXSTADT </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/04/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PROP, ZI, NI, UK, AS </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: THE FOUNDATIONS OF OBASANJO\'S FANTASIES </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Ref:  (A) Harare 422 </p><p>-     (B) Abuja 343 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER; REASONS 1.5 (B) AND </p><p>(D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) Although not a formal member of the Front Line States, </p><p>Nigeria was in the vanguard of those fighting for the </p><p>liberation of southern Africa.  The current Chief of Staff of </p><p>the Air Force has told us stories of the role he played in </p><p>ferreting weapons to ZANU to shore up ZANU\'s fight against the </p><p>Rhodesians. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Nigeria\'s support for Mugabe today is rooted in the </p><p>era of liberation.  Nigerians generally, not just Obasanjo, </p><p>are loathe to "abandon" someone they see as both prot ?and </p><p>ally, the more so when there is a widespread perception that </p><p>"the West" (especially the UK) is carrying water for white </p><p>farmers whose forebears expropriated land belonging to the </p><p>rightful black owners.  In other words, the Nigerians believe </p><p>that land issues are at the root of the political crisis in </p><p>Zimbabwe, and they deeply resent pressure from the UK, feeling </p><p>HMG did not do nearly enough to realize a fair and equitable </p><p>redistribution of land in years past.  They also ignore the </p><p>overwhelming evidence that the GOZ is redistributing land not </p><p>to right historical wrongs but to provide favors to supporters </p><p>while punishing opponents.  For them, this redistribution is </p><p>"justice".  The lack of reference to historical antecedents </p><p>and established principles of land redistribution in Africa </p><p>does not invalidate the "principle," in their minds. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Obasanjo also believes he owes a debt to Mugabe, a </p><p>friend for more than 25 years with whom he has a deep personal </p><p>bond.  Obasanjo was Head of State during the Lancaster House </p><p>negotiations and has repeatedly stated that he pressured </p><p>Mugabe to accept a constitution that would hold land reform in </p><p>abeyance even though Mugabe wanted to forge ahead immediately </p><p>on the issue.  In the late eighties and early nineties, </p><p>Obasanjo also counseled Mugabe to bridle his drive for land </p><p>reform so events in Zimbabwe would not scare apartheid </p><p>supporters and thus throttle reform in South Africa.  After </p><p>having twice asked Mugabe to cool his heels, Obasanjo feels </p><p>obliged to support Mugabe on land reform now, the flaws that </p><p>riddle its implementation notwithstanding.  Obasanjo adheres </p><p>firmly to an erroneous belief that Zimbabwe\'s political and </p><p>economic crisis today is unrelated to the chaos arising from </p><p>political events that have taken place over the past year. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) The Nigerians, again not just Obasanjo, find it just </p><p>excruciatingly difficult to criticize Mugabe when they see him </p><p>in conflict with his old adversaries (white Zimbabweans); this </p><p>makes them want to see inequalities in land distribution as </p><p>root rather than secondary causes of political and economic </p><p>crisis.  Zimbabweans and Nigerian diplomats in Zimbabwe see an </p><p>autocratic and increasingly brutal old man who refuses to cede </p><p>power gracefully.  Nigerians in Nigeria, including Obasanjo </p><p>himself, still see the Mugabe they supported in the 70s. </p><p>These factors, together with the points made in para four, may </p><p>underlie Obasanjo\'s willingness to believe GOZ assertions </p><p>despite all evidence to the contrary.  Of course, we cannot </p><p>confirm that Nigerian diplomats in Harare report faithfully to </p><p>Abuja the views they hold forth to U.S. diplomats.  Ambassador </p><p>Olufemi George, the MFA Under Secretary for Africa, professes </p><p>a firm belief that land is the fundamental cause of Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>instability.  Other key advisors, including Foreign Minister </p><p>Sule Lamido and International Affairs Advisor Ad\'Obe Obe, take </p><p>equally hard lines.  The position that Obasanjo takes on the </p><p>Zimbabwe question is fed and reinforced by these hardliners. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Obasanjo was clearly annoyed with Australia for having </p><p>implemented sanctions that went beyond those imposed by the </p><p>Commonwealth.  He made that clear in his letter to Howard, and </p><p>it was one of the first points he raised in a meeting (ref B) </p><p>with Ambassador Jeter and AF DAS Bridgewater.  His personal </p><p>distaste for Howard magnified Obasanjo\'s outrage at Howard\'s </p><p>unilateral action.  Animus toward Howard is pervasive within </p><p>the GON. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Obasanjo has also been unhappy with MDC leader Morgan </p><p>Tsvangirai, whom he views as unreasonable and inflexible.  The </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>fact that Tsvangirai went to the media with details about an </p><p>earlier meeting with Obasanjo reportedly annoyed the Nigerian </p><p>President.  Moreover, Obasanjo tends to regard the views of </p><p>those shorter in the tooth than he (whether in chronological </p><p>years or in years of experience as a national leader) as less </p><p>worthy of serious consideration than those of contemporaries. </p><p>This tendency has at times heightened domestic tensions, and </p><p>it may be a factor in his dealings, respectively, with Mugabe </p><p>and Tsvangirai. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) That said, the British High Commissioner here </p><p>believes that there is flexibility in Nigeria\'s position. </p><p>Obasanjo desperately wants to hold the next Commonwealth </p><p>Summit in Abuja and will not jeopardize that opportunity even </p><p>for Mugabe.  The HC told Ambassador Jeter that if a </p><p>recommendation for Mugabe\'s continued suspension comes from </p><p>the Commonwealth Secretary General and Secretariat Obasanjo </p><p>will not oppose it and will go forward with the Commonwealth </p><p>Summit even if Mugabe is excluded.  However, if the </p><p>recommendation comes from Howard, it will be much harder for </p><p>Obasanjo to swallow. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
