<p>S E C R E T ABUJA 000753 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE PASS AF/W, NEA - DAS CROCKER </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/23/20013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, ECON, EPET, NI, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: GON SAYS OPEC UNLIKELY TO CUT </p><p>PRODUCTION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF:  STATE 101320 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter for reason </p><p>1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S) On April 22, Ambassador Jeter delivered reftel </p><p>demarche to President Obasanjo\'s Special Advisor on </p><p>Petroleum Affairs and Energy Rilwanu Lukman.  Lukman, </p><p>who is leading Nigeria\'s delegation to the April 24 </p><p>OPEC meeting in Vienna and was OPEC General Secretary </p><p>for ten years, said the normally conservative OPEC </p><p>would be unlikely to cut production until the </p><p>situation in Iraq is more clear.  Lukman cautioned, </p><p>however, it would not take much additional oil to </p><p>oversupply the market, and OPEC wants to maintain a </p><p>price of $22 to $28 dollars. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) Lukman said Iraq would likely take 9 to 12 </p><p>months to return production to its pre-Operation Iraqi </p><p>Freedom quota of 2.5 million barrels/day, and it would </p><p>be more than two years before Iraq produces oil at its </p><p>pre-Gulf War level of 3.1 million barrels/day.  He </p><p>told local press on April 23, "If Iraq doesn\'t come </p><p>back immediately, as I expect it will not, then we </p><p>have to continue to supply the market.  We don\'t want </p><p>the price to go too high."  He added, "we have to </p><p>anticipate when Iraq is likely to come back and </p><p>prepare accordingly.  We will find out what the </p><p>Americans are doing, how soon they will have a new </p><p>government in place, and, more importantly, how soon </p><p>it will take them to rehabilitate their </p><p>infrastructure." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
