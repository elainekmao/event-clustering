The shopkeepers, who have been </p><p>complaining that their customers are treated like </p><p>terrorists, are in big distress."  The security </p><p>circle around the US ConGen in Istanbul brought </p><p>the shopkeepers in Tepebasi to the verge of </p><p>bankruptcy. The shopkeepers said the increased </p><p>security measures due to the war in Iraq hurt </p><p>them very badly and added "We are living the </p><p>prisoners\' life in our own town. Our customers </p><p>have been driven out. We have no power left to </p><p>endure any longer.

Hotel Bale Reception Director, Umut Sarko </p><p>said "They tried to catch a cat in the street on </p><p>the grounds that there might be a bomb tied to </p><p>its strap. They interrogated the family of a </p><p>student staying at our hotel for having taken a </p><p>photograph." Hitit Gift Shop Owner, Ismail </p><p>Akdemir said, "It is as though this is the </p><p>American soil, and we are terrorists." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ECONOMIC AND AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENTS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.
