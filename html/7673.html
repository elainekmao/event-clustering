<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L OTTAWA 001169 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/25/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPKO, EU, MK, CA, NATO </p><p>SUBJECT: CANADIAN CONCERNS ABOUT EUROPEAN DEFENSE SUMMIT, </p><p>ESDP "BURDENSHARING" </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) STATE 103884 (B) USNATO 461 (C) WARSAW 1642 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Minister Counselor Brian Flora, </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Canada shares our strong concerns about the April 29 </p><p>"European Defense Summit" (ref. A), and is pleased that we </p><p>are making U.S. views clear to Europe.  Lisa Helfand, Foreign </p><p>Affairs Deputy Director for Defense and Security Relations, </p><p>said the GoC considers the Summit very unhelpful both for the </p><p>NATO Alliance and for ESDP goals.  She noted that Belgian </p><p>Political Director Carbonez had offered to come to Ottawa to </p><p>brief the GoC on the Summit, but Canada turned off the visit. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Helfand also gave us further details on the aborted </p><p>Canadian effort to deploy a staff officer to the EU\'s </p><p>Operation Concordia in Macedonia (refs. B and C).  Like </p><p>Poland, Canada was completely surprised that they would be </p><p>charged for participation.  Canada had planned to contribute </p><p>one staff officer (lieutenant colonel), but the day before he </p><p>was to deploy the EU presented Canada with a bill for 240,000 </p><p>Euros.  The EU informed Canada that since 25% of the </p><p>personnnel for Concordia were from non-EU countries, those </p><p>countries would have to pay 25% of the operating costs. </p><p>Individual country contributions were pro-rated on the basis </p><p>of GDP. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Helfand said that Canadian Foreign Minister Graham </p><p>raised this issue with EU Foreign Minister Solana, but that </p><p>the EU was unable/unwilling to backtrack from this policy. </p><p>Helfand said this could have implications in Bosnia if and </p><p>when the EU takes over from SFOR, where Canada currently has </p><p>1270 personnel.  The UK and the Netherlands would like the </p><p>Canadian Forces to stay in Bosnia, she said, but Canada will </p><p>not be interested if it is charged to participate while being </p><p>excluded from mission oversight. </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
