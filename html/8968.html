<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L COLOMBO 001116 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS, SA/PAB, SA/RA, S/CT </p><p>NSC FOR E. MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  06-25-13 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PTER, CE, IN, PK, External Relations </p><p>SUBJECT:  Sri Lankan MFA views on Indo-Pakistani </p><p>relations within SAARC </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Donald Camp, Charge d\'Affaires. </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b, d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) During separate June 24 meetings with Charge </p><p>focused on other subjects, Foreign Secretary Nihal </p><p>Rodrigo and MFA Additional Secretary for SAARC Sarala </p><p>Fernando touched on current Indo-Pakistani relations </p><p>within SAARC.  (Note:  Rodrigo is the former head of the </p><p>SAARC Secretariat in Kathmandu.)  They made the </p><p>following key points: </p><p> </p><p>--  The scheduled July 9-10 foreign secretaries meeting </p><p>in Kathmandu is intended to focus on a protocol to </p><p>SAARC\'s convention on counterterrorism.  Fernando stated </p><p>that the protocol is meant to address post-9/11 </p><p>counterterrorism issues, thus updating SAARC\'s </p><p>convention on the issue.  Each interlocutor described </p><p>the protocol as dealing with issues of terrorist </p><p>financing and "practical" issues on a regional basis. </p><p>Rodrigo said MFA legal advisor Rohan Perera has had </p><p>informal discussions re the protocol with India and </p><p>Pakistan in an effort to prevent Indo-Pakistan </p><p>disagreement over interpretations of "terrorism" and, </p><p>thus, help ensure a productive meeting.  (Note:  Perera </p><p>is in Washington this week and plans to discuss the </p><p>protocol at the Department.)  Rodrigo and Fernando also </p><p>thought that the upcoming July 9-10 meeting could be </p><p>successful if the discussion remained at the working </p><p>technical level, excluding politics. </p><p> </p><p>--  Fernando further thought that if the July Kathmandu </p><p>meeting went well, there would be the usual SAARC </p><p>ministerial meeting taking place on the UNGA sidelines </p><p>in September.  She added that success at these two </p><p>meetings might even lead to a follow-on summit.  The </p><p>Indians had made clear to the GSL, however, that they </p><p>would not commit too far in advance to any specific </p><p>summit date over worry of a possible terrorist attack. </p><p> </p><p>--  Related to a possible summit, the Indian government </p><p>was also uneasy re head of state attendance, wanting to </p><p>avoid the possibility of an awkward Vajpayee-Musharraf </p><p>encounter, preferring a Vajpayee-Jamali meeting.  With </p><p>some confidence, Fernando said Pakistan had informally </p><p>agreed to be represented at the summit by Prime Minister </p><p>Jamali, thereby addressing India\'s concern. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>CAMP </p><p></p></div>
