<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABU DHABI 001032 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR NEA/ARP AND NEA/NGA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/01/13 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, IZ, TC </p><p>SUBJECT: DESPITE WIDESPREAD PUBLIC OPPOSITION </p><p>        TO IRAQ WAR, UAE "STREET" QUIET SO FAR </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Classified by DCM Richard A. Albright, </p><p>for Reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Despite widespread public opposition to a </p><p>U.S.-led war on Iraq, the UAE "street" has been </p><p>quiet thus far.  Other than a few very well- </p><p>organized and very small demonstrations, there have </p><p>been no other public gatherings.  This is in </p><p>contrast to the onset of the Al-Aqsa intifada in </p><p>October 2000 and the Israeli incursion into Jenin in </p><p>April 2002, both of which witnessed large public, </p><p>but very peaceful demonstrations.  In a recent </p><p>meeting with the Ambassador, State Security Director </p><p>and Presidential son Shaykh Hazza bin Zayid Al- </p><p>Nahyan predicted that at most there would be a few </p><p>peaceful demonstrations should it come to war.  He </p><p>added that the authorities had not received any </p><p>requests for demonstrations, noting that the </p><p>security services had learned a lot from the </p><p>publicly sanctioned demonstrations during the </p><p>Palestinian Al-Aqsa intifada.  Hazza explained that </p><p>the services had placed agents in the demonstrations </p><p>to pinpoint potential troublemakers. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) During a visit to the American University </p><p>of Sharjah on February 23 to open an exhibition of </p><p>Ground Zero photographs, the Ambassador was greeted </p><p>by a small, extremely peaceful, group of student </p><p>protestors (mostly Arab expats) carrying gruesome </p><p>pictures of maimed Palestinian and Iraqi civilians </p><p>as well as placards condemning war on Iraq.  The </p><p>Ambassador stopped to chat with these students as </p><p>well as with another small group of Emirati women </p><p>protestors toting candles.  The head of the student </p><p>council delivered remarks at the exhibition\'s </p><p>opening ceremony critical of U.S. policy towards </p><p>Iraq but also very critical of terrorism, Usama Bin </p><p>Laden and Al-Qaida. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) APAO and Regional Information Resources </p><p>Officer found that it was "business as usual" during </p><p>a visit to UAE University in Al-Ain.  Several U.S. </p><p>citizens working at the university commented that </p><p>they had personally neither experienced nor </p><p>witnessed an increase in anti-U.S. sentiments among </p><p>the student population.  In fact, the resident </p><p>Americans noted that the university administration </p><p>is taking steps to circumvent anti-Americanism, </p><p>going so far as monitoring and, if necessary, </p><p>censoring presentations and speeches of foreign </p><p>visitors for any anti-U.S. rhetoric. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) COMMENT:  We believe there will be some </p><p>public demonstrations should the U.S. opt for war, </p><p>particularly without UN cover, but they will </p><p>probably remain non-violent.  Our non-official </p><p>contacts are almost overwhelmingly opposed to a </p><p>military option.  As elsewhere in the region, people </p><p>are careful to note their support for the Iraqi </p><p>people but their absolute disgust with Saddam\'s </p><p>regime. </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
