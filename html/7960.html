Summary: At our second annual Earth Day roundtable, </p><p>the ConGen\'s economic and public affairs sections </p><p>joined efforts to invite two U.S. company country </p><p>directors to discuss environmental protection, </p><p>corporate responsibility and national development.  Two </p><p>Vietnamese economics publications ran articles based on </p><p>the discussion, in which 10 prominent environmental </p><p>scholars, writers and business leaders participated. </p><p>End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  At the roundtable, representatives from CDM and </p><p>SELCO (Solar Energy Light Company) discussed how their </p><p>companies are improving wastewater processing (CDM) and </p><p>rural electrification (SELCO).  The CDM manager also </p><p>discussed international efforts to develop Vietnam\'s </p><p>infrastructure, and how pursuing environmentally sound </p><p>policies now will have significant benefits in the long </p><p>run.  The CDM representative noted that a recent World </p><p>Bank grant has drawn the attention of policymakers and </p><p>the educated public to the problems of open sewage and </p><p>contamination of the waterways. </p><p> </p><p>3.  The director of SELCO, whose company was recognized </p><p>in 2001 by Secretary Powell with the State Department\'s </p><p>Award for Corporate Excellence, discussed his firm\'s </p><p>efforts to electrify rural areas through solar power. </p><p>He emphasized the importance of using renewable energy </p><p>sources and skyrocketing energy demands in Vietnam. </p><p> </p><p>4.  The director of Saigon Hi-tech Park talked about </p><p>the organization\'s recycling of natural resources and </p><p>its energy-efficient power generating facility.  Other </p><p>scholars and business people focused on raising public </p><p>awareness, and on avoiding the problems of other </p><p>developing countries by implementing an eco-friendly </p><p>energy policy now, rather than later. </p><p> </p><p>5.  The Vietnam Economic Times (VET) and Agriculture </p><p>("Nong Nghiep") ran articles on the roundtable.  Both </p><p>pieces covered the discussion themes, and VET had a </p><p>sidebar interview with the director of CDM.  "Nong </p><p>Nghiep\'s" article focused on SELCO\'s projects and the </p><p>role of Vietnam\'s agricultural and rural development </p><p>bank in providing financing for families in isolated </p><p>areas who are installing SELCO\'s solar electric </p><p>systems. </p><p> </p><p>YAMAUCHI. </p><p></p></div>
