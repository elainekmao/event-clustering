<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 002827 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 1.6X5, 1.6X6 </p><p>TAGS: PINS, MOPS, PREF, PGOV, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: BENUE UPDATE FROM SSS DIRECTOR GENERAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ABUJA 2708 </p><p>     B. ABUJA 2750 </p><p>     C. ABUJA NI 2776 </p><p>     D. IIR 7 800 0052 02 </p><p>     E. IIR 7 800 0065 02 </p><p>     F. IIR 7 800 0064 02 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by CDA Andrews; Reasons 1.6X5, 1.6X6. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (S/NF) SUMMARY: During a November 2 meeting, SSS DG Are </p><p>briefed the CDA on the recent violence in Benue.  It was a </p><p>mystery to Are how the 19 murdered soldiers had let </p><p>themselves be disarmed.  Are insisted the Army was </p><p>investigating the alleged reprisals against villagers and </p><p>planned to punish those responsible.  Pointing to the number </p><p>of ex-military in the State, Are expressed concern Tiv </p><p>leaders needed to exercise statesmanship or the situation in </p><p>Benue might deteriorate further.  Are estimated the number of </p><p>internally displaced persons (IDP) to be 186,000.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) CDA Andrews November 2 met State Security Service </p><p>(SSS) Director General Kayode Are to discuss the recent </p><p>violence in Benue/Taraba States.  The meeting was arranged in </p><p>response to CDA\'s indirect request to VP Atiku Abubakar for </p><p>an opportunity to meet with someone who had accompanied him </p><p>on his fact-finding mission to Benue and Taraba. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S/NF) Are showed Andrews an internal SSS investigative </p><p>report summarizing interviews with witnesses and suspects in </p><p>the murder of the 19 soldiers (16 bodies have been recovered </p><p>to date).  Contrary to allegations in some media, no senior </p><p>GON official nor any nationally prominent figure was </p><p>implicated for supporting the Tiv militia.  The most senior </p><p>person directly implicated in the soldiers\' deaths was the </p><p>deputy chairman of a local government area. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) COMMENT: While not accusing Gemade of the deaths of </p><p>the soldiers and for reasons that may have to do more with </p><p>factional infighting in the PDP, Benue Governor Akume has </p><p>publicly blamed embattled PDP Chairman Barnabas Gemade for </p><p>hiring local thugs to engage in violence during a student </p><p>protest against the Army\'s alleged reprisal attacks.  Gemade, </p><p>in turn, has charged Akume with fomenting dissent in order to </p><p>further his political agenda.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (S/NF) Are said the SSS might never be able to  determine </p><p>how the 19 soldiers were disarmed.  The operating hypothesis </p><p>(see Ref D) is that the soldiers believed their ROE precluded </p><p>use of weapons, even in self-defense.  The soldiers, Are </p><p>continued, were marched by the militia to the Zaki-Biam Local </p><p>Government Area (LGA) headquarters, where the LGA Chairman, </p><p>Pilate-like, washed his hands of the situation, saying the </p><p>soldiers should be taken to the police.  At the police </p><p>station, ethnic Tiv police told the militia (in the Tiv </p><p>language) that the soldiers were "their problem" and that </p><p>they should "take care of them."  The soldiers were murdered </p><p>soon after; all were decapitated and castrated.  Some were </p><p>disemboweled.  Heads were mounted on poles and paraded. </p><p>(NOTE: Horrific photographs of the butchery were printed in </p><p>"Tell" magazine.  END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (S/NF) Despite the gruesome nature of the soldiers\' </p><p>deaths, SSS believed the military\'s response was wrong.  Are </p><p>said the Army is considering courts-martial for any soldier </p><p>involved.  There was no indication yet that anyone above the </p><p>rank of captain might have been complicit, but that </p><p>possibility could not be excluded.  Investigations were </p><p>continuing. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) CDA told Are that the GON needed to do a better job of </p><p>letting the public know that it was investigating both the </p><p>original murders and the reprisal attacks, with the intention </p><p>of tracking down culprits and bringing them to justice. </p><p>Partisans of one side to the conflict in the area were </p><p>contacting diplomatic missions, the media, and possibly NGOs </p><p>to present their perspective.  The GON\'s relative silence </p><p>risked creating an atmosphere in which its eventual </p><p>explanation might be seen as a contrivance.  Individuals and </p><p>groups concerned with human rights in the U.S. were not </p><p>unmindful of the difficulties the GON faces in resolving the </p><p>crisis.  They would show patience, but patience should not be </p><p>misinterpreted disinterest, Andrews stressed.  If the GON has </p><p>a story to tell, it should tell it accurately but quickly. </p><p>Nigeria\'s diplomats could do so in capitals to which they are </p><p>accredited.  The GON should not rely exclusively on the </p><p>reporting of foreign diplomats in Nigeria. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (S/NF) Are said he was perceived by all sides in the Benue </p><p>clash as neutral.  He had, in fact, reached out to some "Tivs </p><p>who want peace" to seek their support in lowering tensions. </p><p>He specifically mentioned retired BG John Atom Kpera.  He </p><p>wanted the GON to avoid an "information war" with Tiv </p><p>representatives and would encourage his interlocutors to urge </p><p>their ethnic brethren not to put the GON in a position where </p><p>it would feel compelled to respond to public accusations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (S/NF) Are expressed concern, however, that if Tiv leaders </p><p>did not begin to energetically discourage militia action, the </p><p>security situation in northern Benue state could deteriorate </p><p>badly.  He was saddened that two suspected militia members </p><p>had served under him in the Army.  One, he said, was a </p><p>particularly competent soldier and leader with combat </p><p>experience in Liberia and extensive time in peacekeeping. </p><p>With the Tivs, the Nigerian Army was not facing the usual </p><p>ethnic thuggery; many of these men were  well-trained and </p><p>perhaps well-armed. </p><p>10. (U) NOTE: Police three weeks ago stopped a vehicle </p><p>belonging to a retired military officer and reportedly found </p><p>several thousand rounds of ammunition.  The vehicle was </p><p>stopped in Nasarawa State, apparently headed for the </p><p>Taraba/Benue border area.  END NOTE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (S/NF) Andrews asked if conditions permitted Embassy </p><p>personnel to visit IDP camps.  Are said most camps were </p><p>around Makurdi and he had no objection to visiting this area </p><p>since it was relatively secure.  SSS believed there were </p><p>about 186,000 IDPs (Governor Akume has suggested the number </p><p>might be around 250,000, a figure Are considered too high). </p><p>Are discouraged visiting the Gboko, Takum and Wukari areas </p><p>because the security situation was still unstable.  He agreed </p><p>that inhabitants there could indeed show significant </p><p>destruction caused by the Nigerian Army, and reiterated the </p><p>GON\'s intention to prosecute those responsible. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (S/NF) Are claimed that LTG Malu\'s (ret) house was </p><p>attacked not out of animus toward Malu but because fleeing </p><p>militiamen began shooting at soldiers after taking refuge in </p><p>the compound.  Are said he was not taking Malu\'s calls </p><p>because Malu had the unfortunate tendency to quote publicly </p><p>those with whom he spoke.  (COMMENT:  Are avoids public </p><p>appearances, preferring to work in the background.  He is </p><p>deeply allergic to being quoted publicly.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (S/NF) Notwithstanding significant public antipathy </p><p>toward the Tivs who many consider an aggressive, militant </p><p>group, President Obasanjo was intent on restoring "everyone" </p><p>to his land.  That would be difficult this time, Are opined, </p><p>because those who had driven the Tiv out of Nasarawa and </p><p>Taraba had wiped out traces of Tiv habitation wherever </p><p>possible.  They had razed villages and even removed cemetery </p><p>markers, for example.  While lamenting this activity, Are </p><p>expressed some sympathy for the Tivs\' antagonists.  Tivs, he </p><p>said, do not assimilate into the local communities.  They get </p><p>the local populations to provide them (unused) land but then </p><p>build their own, separate communities.  After a generation or </p><p>two, Tivs often try to take over the entire area and drive </p><p>out the original settlers.  Are agreed that the importance of </p><p>"indigenousness" in Nigeria\'s political system was a major </p><p>aggravating factor in the violence. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) COMMENT: The gruesome murders of the hapless soldiers </p><p>have moved many Nigerians toward disgust at the Tiv militia. </p><p>While Nigerians do not condone the reprisal attacks, they </p><p>understand the emotion behind them.  Further, many Nigerians </p><p>view the military as the only institution capable of </p><p>maintaining order by containing large-scale violence.  If the </p><p>army now is perceived as vulnerable to attack by ethnic </p><p>militias, then maintenance of order becomes even more </p><p>difficult.  Thus, for those who see the Army as the lone </p><p>institution that stands between them and possible chaos, the </p><p>deaths of the civilians in Benue is an unfortunate but </p><p>acceptable price to pay.  The importance of </p><p>reprofessionalizing Nigeria\'s Army is thus once again made </p><p>clear.  END COMMENT. </p><p>Andrews </p><p></p></div>
