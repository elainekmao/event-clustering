<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L OTTAWA 000702 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR UNESCO OBSERVER; MARSEILLES FOR MONACO </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/13/2013 </p><p>TAGS: AORC, CA, UNESCO </p><p>SUBJECT: CANADA TO PURSUE UNESCO EXECUTIVE BOARD SEAT </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 61697 </p><p> </p><p>     B. STATE 54900 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Acting Political Counselor Mary Witt for reasons 1.5(b) </p><p>and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C)  Embassy presented the talking points contained reftel </p><p>A concerning the U.S. candidacy for election to the UNESCO </p><p>executive board to Jean-Luc Chouinard, Special Advisor for </p><p>UNESCO in the UN Specialized Agencies Section of DFAIT\'s </p><p>International Organizations Bureau, on March 11.  Poloff had </p><p>a follow-up discussion with Chouinard on March 13.  Chouinard </p><p>said that Canada welcomes the U.S.\'s return to UNESCO. </p><p>2.  (C)  Chouinard indicated Canada will be a candidate for a </p><p>seat on the UNESCO executive board.  He said Canada would </p><p>like our support for its candidacy, and will seriously </p><p>consider giving its support to our candidacy. Chouinard said </p><p>there are a possible 10 candidates for the 5 open Group 1 </p><p>seats on the executive board. He identified those candidates </p><p>as France, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, Monaco, Portugal, </p><p>Switzerland, Denmark, the U.S., and Canada. When asked about </p><p>the possibility of Canada supporting a consensus slate of </p><p>candidates, Chouinard responded that experience has shown </p><p>them that such slates aren\'t successful in UNESCO executive </p><p>board elections. Chouinard said the culture of UNESCO isn\'t </p><p>conducive to slates of candidates; in that sense, he noted, </p><p>UNESCO differs from other UN organizations. </p><p>3.  (C)   Chouinard shares our concern that a better balance </p><p>needs to be established in Group 1 board representation </p><p>between EU and non-E.U. states. He feels this will be hard to </p><p>do in the near term, but in the longer term we should work on </p><p>getting the Group 1 states to agree on a different, more </p><p>balanced approach to filling seats. Chouinard is hopeful </p><p>there will be a place for both the U.S. and Canada on the </p><p>executive board, as he thinks we could do a lot of useful </p><p>things if we are serving together. Comment: It is our </p><p>impression from the discussion with Chouinard that Canada </p><p>might agree to join a consensus slate, or to back a consensus </p><p>slate, after other possible members of the slate have been </p><p>identified. End comment. </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
