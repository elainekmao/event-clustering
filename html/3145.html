<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001437 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PD, AF/S, AF/RA </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, KPAO, ZI, Media and Communications </p><p>SUBJECT: GOVERNMENT TIGHTENS CONTROL OVER MEDIA -- NEW </p><p>ACCREDITATION REQUIREMENTS PUBLISHED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   The government of Zimbabwe has announced the new </p><p>      registration and accreditation requirements for media </p><p>      organizations and journalists as prescribed by the Access </p><p>      to Information and Protection of Privacy Act (AIPPA). </p><p>      According to an extraordinary gazette published on June 15, </p><p>      media organizations are now required to pay an application </p><p>      fee of Z$20,000 and a registration charge of Z$500,000. </p><p>      Local journalists working for the local media are now </p><p>      required to pay an application fee of Z$1,000 and an </p><p>      accreditation fee of Z$5,000, to allow them to operate in </p><p>      the country.  Local freelance journalists will pay an </p><p>      application fee of Z$500 and an accreditation fee of </p><p>      Z$2,500.  Local journalists working for the foreign media </p><p>      will pay an application fee of US$50 and an accreditation </p><p>      fee of US$1,000.  Foreign journalists intending to work </p><p>      temporarily in Zimbabwe are required to pay US$100 and </p><p>      another US$500 for accreditation.  All foreign media </p><p>      organizations seeking permission to operate a </p><p>      representative office in Zimbabwe are now required to pay </p><p>      an application fee of US$2,000 and another US$10,000 for </p><p>      permission to operate. </p><p> </p><p>  2.   The new regulations also require that applications </p><p>      from media organizations include information about their </p><p>      business plan.  That includes annual balance sheets, profit </p><p>      and loss statements, cash flow statements, and information </p><p>      about the organization\'s financial backers and its leaders\' </p><p>      professional experience.  Media organizations will also be </p><p>      required to pay a levy of 0.5 percent of its audited annual </p><p>      gross turnover to the Media and Information Fund. </p><p> </p><p>  3.   In conjunction with other aspects of AIPPA, most </p><p>      notably its prohibition on "publishing falsehoods" (thus </p><p>      far applied only to privately owned media), these new </p><p>      registration procedures strengthen the Government of </p><p>      Zimbabwe\'s ability to control the media. </p><p> </p><p>  4.   Under headline "Media should not be entrapped like the </p><p>      commercial farmers," the June 15 edition of the independent </p><p>      daily "The Daily News" carried the following editorial: </p><p> </p><p>      ".Registering with the registrar of companies is a </p><p>      legal requirement upon forming a company, so the </p><p>      requirement under the AIPPA that media companies - </p><p>      already registered under the Companies Act - should </p><p>      register again, amount to double registration.  If </p><p>      there is no intent to deny any media organization </p><p>      registration, why does the Media and Information </p><p>      Commission not accept registration under the </p><p>      Companies Act as being valid under the law.?  One of </p><p>      the dilemmas of registering is that it presupposes </p><p>      an acceptance to subject oneself to AIPPA.  Once you </p><p>      are in you can\'t get out.  It also might imply full </p><p>      acceptance of the penalties attached thereto.  In </p><p>      fairness to all, the media organizations should seek </p><p>      a postponement to the Sunday deadline, while the </p><p>      commission prepares itself for the task." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
