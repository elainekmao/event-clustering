Turkey, positive </p><p>about the U.S. plan to arm the northern Iraqi Kurds, offered </p><p>to distribute and collect light weaponry to the groups in </p><p>the region, but U.S. turned down the offer, reports say. </p><p>Ankara has found unacceptable the U.S. demand for exemption </p><p>of American troops from VAT.  Monday\'s papers carry Foreign </p><p>Minister Yakis\' remarks that compromise about political and </p><p>economic issues was near.  Yakis stressed Turkey would not </p><p>accept minority status for the Turkomen.  U.S. is against </p><p>Turkey\'s demand that Turkomen should be represented in the </p><p>post-war Iraqi administration, papers add.  Saturday\'s </p><p>"Milliyet" says Ankara wanted the militia in northern Iraq </p><p>dissolved into a single national Iraqi army after the war. </p><p>Weekend reports say if the GOT accepts the economic and </p><p>military aid package by the U.S., the parliament will </p><p>probably approve on Tuesday deployment of U.S. troops in </p><p>Turkey.  Saturday\'s papers report Ankara wanted a Turkish </p><p>representative in the interim administration to be set up by </p><p>the U.S. in post-Saddam Iraq.  Monday\'s papers carry </p><p>concerns of northern Iraqi Kurdish officials\' concerns over </p><p>Turkish military presence in the region.  "Milliyet" reports </p><p>that KDP leader Barzani has promised to refrain from </p><p>declaring an independent Kurdish state, stay away from </p><p>Mosul, Kirkuk, and respect the rights of Turkomen if Turks </p><p>do not enter northern Iraq.  Weekend papers report ongoing </p><p>Turkish military buildup on the Iraqi border.  Papers claim </p><p>Turkey has deployed 100,000 troops in the Southeast. </p><p>Sunday\'s "Hurriyet" reports U.S. military equipment was kept </p><p>at the port of Iskenderun to be deployed to northern Iraq </p><p>after the parliamentary decision to allow U.S. troops in </p><p>Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Cyprus: "Milliyet" reports that the UN Secretary General </p><p>Kofi Annan has arrived in Ankara to present to Turkish </p><p>officials a new version of the UN plan for resolving the </p><p>Cyprus issue.  There were five important changes in the plan </p><p>in line with the demands of the Turkish side, paper says. </p><p>The UN deadline for settlement in Cyprus expires on February </p><p>28.  Annan will hold meetings today with the Turkish </p><p>officials and present the plan to the parties in Cyprus on </p><p>Wednesday.  "Milliyet" lists the positive changes in the </p><p>plan, as follows: </p><p>1. Karpaz will remain part of Turkish Cypriot territory and </p><p>the Greek Cypriots in the region will be allowed to set up </p><p>their autonomous administration.  In exchange for Karpaz, </p><p>Turkish side will give territory from the Guzelyurt region, </p><p>to Greek side </p><p>2. Greek Cypriots who migrate from south to north will </p><p>exercise their political rights in the Greek Cypriot zone, </p><p>not in the Turkish zone </p><p>3. 50.000 of the migrated Turks (Turks from Anatolia who </p><p>have come to Cyprus since 1974) will stay in the island </p><p>4. The number of Turkish and Greek soldiers on the island </p><p>will be  a total of 7200 </p><p>5. The expression `partners\' used in the plan in connection </p><p>with the two parties will be replaced with the expression </p><p>`founding partners\'. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION:  US-Turkey cooperation on Iraq </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The grant should be IMF-linked" </p><p>Enis Berberoglu commented in mass appeal Hurriyet (2/23): </p><p>"Are we going to wait for another miracle to happen every </p><p>year in order to save the Turkish economy?  It started first </p><p>with the IMF support which followed by the Iraq war.  Yet </p><p>what is to happen next year?  There is only one way to make </p><p>Turkey a prestigious debtor: An economic program pursued by </p><p>the IMF\'s control and support instead of politics-engaged </p><p>governments.  Thus the IMF condition for the US grant is a </p><p>must.  It is a must, not because the US wants it so, but </p><p>because of the high risk of political abuse." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Just one more step" </p><p>Fehmi Koru argued in Islamic-intellectual Yeni Safak (2/24): </p><p>"It may be called `negotiations\' between Turkey and the US, </p><p>yet a closer look will provide us the truth.  It is about a </p><p>tactical game played by the US in order to manipulate Turkey </p><p>in its own war.  The bilateral relations are presented under </p><p>the `strategic partnership\' rhetoric, and it becomes a tool </p><p>in the US hands to exert pressure on Turkey. . Washington </p><p>not only used moral pressure via strategic partnership </p><p>rhetoric, but also tried to close a deal with Turkey at </p><p>almost.  Therefore a propaganda war has begun saying that </p><p>`the US is not desperate for Turkey\'s support and it will be </p><p>Turkey\'s loss to stay away from the war.\'  . Thanks to the </p><p>Turkish government\'s efforts, US tactics regarding imminent </p><p>Turkish support failed so far.  There is still hope for a </p><p>settlement without having a war.  Turkey can wait for a </p><p>second UNSC resolution and can pursue diplomacy with </p><p>Washington in the meantime.  There is no need to rush the </p><p>authorization decree to the parliament." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Result will not be obtained in the short term" </p><p>Osman Oralat wrote in economic/politics Dunya (2/24): "There </p><p>are enough indications to believe that the driving force </p><p>behind the US plan is about energy resources and oil fields. </p><p>The US wants to ensure its hegemony over the resources as </p><p>early as possible.  Therefore the Iraq operation is going to </p><p>be the first of the many more to come.  Even if the Iraq </p><p>operation is concluded in a short term, there will be new </p><p>operations on the way." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
