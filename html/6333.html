<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 SANAA 000492 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: SCUL, PREL, PGOV, IZ, YM </p><p>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR HULL\'S INTERVIEW WITH AL-AYYAM </p><p> </p><p>Translated text of Ambassador Hull\'s Arabic Interview with </p><p>Al-Ayyam. Other aspects of the Ambassador\'s March 9-10 visit </p><p>to Aden reported reftel. </p><p> </p><p>Begin Text: </p><p> </p><p>"Q: We have learned that today you visited various places in </p><p>Aden which have received U.S. assistance. Could you please </p><p>tell us what kind of assistance was given? </p><p> </p><p>A: Of course, my visit to Aden has two objectives, the first </p><p>one focuses on development and the other one focuses on </p><p>security.  We started today to focus on development, </p><p>including the assistance for manufacturing school furniture </p><p>for schools all over the Republic of Yemen. We visited a </p><p>school furniture factory in Mualla, Aden. We highly </p><p>appreciate the efforts of all partners and the efforts of </p><p>Yemeni workers. I think the factory currently employs about </p><p>700 Yemeni workers. In addition to that, we visited the </p><p>branch of the Yemen Women,s Union that has now a computer </p><p>lab to provide training. No doubt, the Union provides great </p><p>service to Yemeni society and Yemeni women, especially the </p><p>new generation. Our efforts will continue in Yemen to assist </p><p>Yemeni governorates, including Aden. </p><p> </p><p>Q: Does this assistance come within U.S. policy to support </p><p>Yemeni civil society institutions? </p><p> </p><p>A: Yes, we have a partnership with the Yemeni government and </p><p>with civil society institutions. </p><p> </p><p>Q: Let,s now move to the security side. The United States is </p><p>currently training Yemeni coast guards. It installed </p><p>observation systems in strategic locations in Aden city. How </p><p>is this security cooperation going, and what can we expect in </p><p>the near future? </p><p> </p><p>A: We believe that there is a link between development and </p><p>security. There is no development without security and no </p><p>security without development. Therefore, I believe that our </p><p>efforts regarding the Yemeni Coast Guard are very important. </p><p>We, at present, are working with two objectives. The first </p><p>one is to train the new coast guard cadres and the second one </p><p>is to provide boats and necessary equipment for the Coast </p><p>Guard. We want to benefit from our visit (to Aden) to find </p><p>locations for the Coast Guard and also locations for </p><p>workshops that can serve the Coast Guard in the future. </p><p> </p><p>Q: What is the number of the trainees who were sent to the </p><p>U.S.?  Will you send more groups? </p><p> </p><p>A: I think the first group of cadres was about 20 persons. </p><p>They are now studying English in Yemen. After they learn the </p><p>language, there will be training in the United States. </p><p> </p><p>Q: How do you evaluate Yemen,s efforts in counter-terrorism? </p><p> </p><p>A: I think Yemen is in the lead among states in </p><p>counter-terrorism. No doubt, this was achieved thanks to the </p><p>policy of President Ali Abdullah Saleh and the cooperation of </p><p>the Yemeni people. We recently noticed a concrete and </p><p>important progress in that regard. I think Yemen now, from </p><p>the terrorism side, is much safer than it was in the past. I </p><p>believe that by continuing more efforts in the future, we </p><p>will see stability and security in this country. </p><p> </p><p>Regarding the security of the southern part of the Red Sea, </p><p>there are many naval vessels that belong to the U.S., </p><p>Germany, and Spain. They all set out from Djibouti. Is there </p><p>a trend for using Aden seaport as well? </p><p> </p><p>A: I think it is possible to use Aden seaport if that is </p><p>acceptable by the Yemeni government. At present we use the </p><p>Port of Djibouti. No doubt that Aden seaport is excellent and </p><p>suitable for use, but it is up to the Yemeni government. </p><p> </p><p>Q: Regarding Iraq, the U.S. Administration is now trying to </p><p>get a new resolution passed by the U.N. Security Council. </p><p>There is opposition from many countries in the Council. How </p><p>do you view the issue of the new resolution? </p><p> </p><p>A: The new resolution is presented by the U.K. It is </p><p>supported by Spain and the U.S. We believe that it is useful </p><p>to be discussed by the Security Council. No one can predict </p><p>the result of that debate. However, it is good that such </p><p>issues will be discussed in full in the Security Council. </p><p> </p><p>Q: Don,t you believe that the rejection of that resolution </p><p>or its failure by veto could form a threat to the legal cover </p><p>that resolution No. 1441 provides? </p><p> </p><p>A: I do not think so. Resolution No. 1441 and the previous </p><p>ones state clearly commitments on the Iraqi government to get </p><p>rid of its weapons of mass destruction fully and immediately. </p><p>It is clear that the recent reports of al-Baradei and Blix </p><p>indicated that the Iraqi government did not comply. So, we </p><p>believe that we have sufficient legal cover to go to military </p><p>action without any other resolutions. </p><p> </p><p>Q: As a Yemeni and an Arab, how can I trust U.S. allegations? </p><p>A: I think we should review the history. We faced a lot of </p><p>problems in the past. Afghanistan and the terrorism coming </p><p>from it were a problem of the international community. We had </p><p>a great challenge regarding the Muslims in Kosovo who were </p><p>being persecuted. If we go further into the past, to the </p><p>Second World War and the great suffering in Europe and Asia. </p><p>I think in all these cases, the U.S. played a leading role in </p><p>facing those challenges. In Europe, during the Second World </p><p>War, in the former Yugoslavia, in Kosovo and the suffering of </p><p>Muslims there. And finally, the suffering of the Afghans as a </p><p>result of the Taliban rule. If you review the situation today </p><p>in all those places, people in Germany, Kosovo, Japan, and in </p><p>Afghanistan are enjoying a much better life as a result of </p><p>the effective leadership of the United States. Therefore, we </p><p>should be judged by our record. </p><p> </p><p>Q: Do you mean that the Iraqi people will be in a better </p><p>situation after the changing of the regime in Baghdad? </p><p> </p><p>A: Yes. No doubt the Iraqi people are a talented and educated </p><p>people and Saddam,s government has caused lots of suffering </p><p>to the Iraqi people and to the peoples of the region. The </p><p>Iraqi people have been suffering for three decades from the </p><p>evil of Saddam Hussein,s regime. The evidence of that is </p><p>that many people from Arab states, Europe, and America can </p><p>see university professors, doctors, and the elite of the </p><p>Iraqi people who were forced by the Baghdad regime to leave </p><p>their homeland and work in those countries as barbers, </p><p>taxi-drivers, and restaurant workers. I am sure that the </p><p>citizens of this Arab state will bear responsibility for the </p><p>developmental reconstruction that will change Iraq within a </p><p>few years. Those people were prevented from living in </p><p>dignity. It is enough for us to recall our memory regarding </p><p>Saddam Hussein,s use of chemical weapons against his people </p><p>in Halabja and against his neighbors. That can make us </p><p>realize that Iraq and the region will be in a better </p><p>situation without that regime. </p><p> </p><p>Q: Do you think that overthrowing the Iraqi president,s </p><p>regime and the establishment of a democratic state will lead </p><p>to the spread of democracy and freedom in the region? </p><p> </p><p>A: I think that we have to know that Arab states and the Arab </p><p>people are now undergoing a number of democratic experiences. </p><p>If you think what is going on in Yemen regarding the upcoming </p><p>elections, political pluralism, free press, and the ability </p><p>of papers such as al-Ayyam to publish reports, I think we </p><p>have to admit that there is a democratic activity that exists </p><p>in this part of the world. I do not believe that this </p><p>democratic activity has arrived in Iraq. In the last </p><p>elections in Iraq, Saddam Hussein got 100% of the votes. What </p><p>I think is that the opportunity will be given to the Iraqi </p><p>citizens soon to create their own democracy. I am confident </p><p>that this talented and educated people will add a great </p><p>experience in that regard for the efforts of many </p><p>(states/nations) in the region. </p><p> </p><p>Q: With regard to Yemen as a U.S. friend and ally, what does </p><p>the U.S. expects from Yemen in the coming conflict with the </p><p>Iraqi regime? </p><p> </p><p>A: We expect that Yemen will seek to achieve its national </p><p>interest. I think that this is up to the Yemeni government to </p><p>decide. I am certain that President Saleh and his government </p><p>will do that. As for us, we wish that our cooperation with </p><p>Yemen continue in the fields of development and security </p><p>because we believe that those fields serve the interests of </p><p>the U.S. and Yemeni people. </p><p> </p><p>Q: Some people say that America will enter Iraq to control </p><p>its oil? </p><p> </p><p>A: With regret, the Iraqi people did not benefit from the oil </p><p>which was discovered in 1928. Iraq is the first Arab oil </p><p>state. Yet, Iraqi oil should not be for Moscow, Washington, </p><p>London, Paris, or any other state, but it is for the people </p><p>of Iraq. This has not yet happened, but it will happen soon. </p><p> </p><p>Q: Many people accuse the U.S. of neglecting the Palestinians </p><p>and their suffering. What do you think? </p><p> </p><p>A: I believe that the nations of the Middle East are still </p><p>worried about  developments in Palestine. President Bush </p><p>reiterated his policy recently that the aim of our efforts is </p><p>to establish an independent and democratic Palestinian state </p><p>that lives peacefully side-by-side with Israel. We have a </p><p> road map, that leads us to that result. This map is not </p><p>the idea of the U.S. only, but it is also the idea of </p><p>Europeans, Russians, and the U.N. I believe that now we must </p><p>put this map in effect so that we reduce violence both on the </p><p>Israeli and Palestinian sides. We also must work towards </p><p>providing more security and a better life for the </p><p>Palestinians. President Bush said clearly that this is very </p><p>important to the U.S. government." </p><p> </p><p>HULL </p><p></p></div>
