FOR WHA, WHA/CEN, INL/LP, AND CA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/25/2013 </p><p>TAGS: SNAR, PREL, PGOV, KCRM, KJUS, SMIG, CVIS, HO </p><p>SUBJECT: HONDURAN PARLACEN CONGRESSMAN BUSTED ON DRUG </p><p>CHARGES IN NICARAGUA CLAIMS IMMUNITY </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. 02 TEGUCIGALPA 2549 </p><p>     B. 02 PANAMA 3031 (NOTAL) </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Chief Francisco L. Palmieri; </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) SUMMARY:  On Friday June 20, a Honduran representative </p><p>to the Central American Parliament (PARLACEN), Cesar Augusto </p><p>Diaz Flores, was arrested in Nicaragua for trafficking and </p><p>possession of seven kilos of heroin (said to be worth some </p><p>USD 6.3 million and a portion of a larger 20-kilo shipment </p><p>from the same source).  With details still developing in this </p><p>case, many questions are being raised about high-level </p><p>government officials meddling in illicit activities and the </p><p>use of legislative immunity by congressmen. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>Claiming Immunity After Being Caught Red-Handed </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) According to press reports and Honduran contacts, on </p><p>Friday, June 20, a Honduran representative to the Central </p><p>American Parliament (PARLACEN), Cesar Augusto Diaz Flores, </p><p>was arrested in Nicaragua for trafficking and possession of </p><p>seven kilos of heroin (said to be worth approximately USD 6.3 </p><p>million and part of a 20-kilo shipment from the same source). </p><p> At approximately 7:30 PM, Diaz was stopped just inside the </p><p>Costa Rican border for a standard vehicle check.  He was </p><p>traveling with three other companions in a gray Hyundai SUV </p><p>with diplomatic plates CD 044 (and an anti-corruption bumper </p><p>sticker).  When asked by the Costa Rican patrol for proof of </p><p>vehicle registration, Diaz reportedly became agitated and </p><p>explained that he had diplomatic plates and need not be </p><p>bothered with the inspection.  After some further bantering, </p><p>Diaz then wielded a .45 caliber pistol and fired two shots </p><p>outside of the vehicle.  No one was hurt in the shooting </p><p>incident.  He then turned his vehicle around and sped over </p><p>the border into Nicaragua, breaking through a security </p><p>barrier in the process.  He was then detained by Nicaraguan </p><p>authorities and the vehicle searched.  The search turned up a </p><p>small suitcase which held seven kilos of heroin. </p><p>Furthermore, the three companions (2 Chinese and 1 Guatemalan </p><p>who were later released) were unable to produce proper </p><p>documentation and it is now believed that Diaz may have been </p><p>involved with alien smuggling.  Diaz has since maintained his </p><p>innocence on all charges brought against him.  He is claiming </p><p>immunity from prosecution based on his status as a Honduran </p><p>member of the PARLACEN. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p>Growing Nexus between Political Elites and Organized Crime </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Cesar Augusto Diaz Flores is a leading political </p><p>figure in his native Sabanagrande, which is in the Department </p><p>of Francisco Morazan just 30 minutes south of the capital. </p><p>He is a member of the Liberal Party and served two terms in </p><p>the Honduran Congress from 1990-1994 and again from </p><p>1994-1998.  His political endorsement was actively being </p><p>sought by practically all of the possible candidates seeking </p><p>the Liberal Party presidential nomination because of his </p><p>popularity with the voters in southern Francisco Morazan </p><p>department.  He has a reputation of generosity and assistance </p><p>to people in need.  He is currently serving a 2002-2007 term </p><p>as 1 of 20 Honduran Congressman with the Central American </p><p>Parliament, with offices located in Guatemala.  (Note: </p><p>PARLACEN membership is widely sought by Honduran political </p><p>leaders because of its perceived broader regional legislative </p><p>immunity.  Former President Rafael Callejas is a PARLACEN </p><p>member.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) According to Embassy sources, Diaz is connected with a </p><p>well-known cartel involved with arms and drug trafficking. </p><p>More specifically, the Costa Rican Ministry of Security </p><p>claims that Diaz works directly with known Colombian </p><p>traffickers Delgado Orozco and Vazquez Salazar.  Costa Rican </p><p>authorities claim to have intelligence that puts Diaz at the </p><p>heart of some recent drug activities in Costa Rica, just </p><p>north of the capital city of San Jose.  Concurrently, Diaz </p><p>has been tied to a large stolen vehicle scam that imported </p><p>stolen vehicles from the U.S. for resale in Honduras.  Diaz </p><p>is known by EmbOff to be close friends with Wilfredo </p><p>Alvarado, the Honduran Consul General in San Jose and a </p><p>former head of the DLCN (the counternarcotics directorate) </p><p>and former special assistant to Attorney General Roy Medina </p><p>(another Liberal Party politician).  Post previously </p><p>suspected a possible connection, but had no proof, between </p><p>Alvarado and Diaz in the sale of Honduran citizenship for </p><p>purposes of smuggling aliens illegally to the United States. </p><p>5. (SBU) Diaz\'s case is similar in many respects to the </p><p>September 9, 2002 arrest of Ricardo Antonio Pena, a former </p><p>Nationalist Party member of the Honduran National Congress, </p><p>who also was traveling on a diplomatic passport and was </p><p>attempting to smuggle four kilos of heroin from Panama to </p><p>Costa Rica.  His U.S. nonimmigrant visa has since been </p><p>revoked by the Consular Section (ref A).  (Note:  Press </p><p>reports in 1999 alleged that Pena was linked to the </p><p>contraband trade in coffee.  End Note.) </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>Immunity or Impunity - When is Enough, Enough? </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>6.  (C)  COMMENT:  Diaz\'s arrest comes at a time when the </p><p>involvement of public figures of various sectors of the </p><p>Honduran government and political class in illicit activities </p><p>has come under intense media scrutiny and speculation.  His </p><p>criminal activity is yet another strong piece of evidence in </p><p>the growing indictment against Honduras\'s political and </p><p>economic elite.  It appears to be another case of the </p><p>outright purchase of power and corrupt use of official status </p><p>to carry out criminal activities.  His invocation of </p><p>parliamentary immunity in order to cover up exposed criminal </p><p>actions reveals the extent to which these powerful Honduran </p><p>political figures believe they are above the law.  It also </p><p>raises the question of when enough is enough in regards to </p><p>immunity claims by Honduran members of the National Congress </p><p>and the PARLACEN. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) COMMENT CONTINUED:  The Embassy has already received </p><p>credible reports from local sources that members of the </p><p>Liberal Party have begun an effort to press on behalf of </p><p>Diaz\'s claim to immunity from Nicaraguan prosecution and </p><p>incredibly to suggest that charges be brought against the </p><p>police agents that executed the search against him. </p><p>Nonetheless, Foreign Minister Guillermo Perez-Cadalso </p><p>declared to the media that the government will provide only </p><p>normal consular services and will await action by the </p><p>PARLACEN on any immunity claim by Diaz.  MFA Director General </p><p>for Foreign Policy Mario Fortin told PolOffs June 25 that the </p><p>GOH had no plans to protect Diaz or any other corrupt </p><p>officials claiming immunity.  However, Post believes there </p><p>are intense efforts under way by Diaz\'s supporters to force </p><p>PARLACEN to act in support of Diaz\'s immunity claim. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) COMMENT CONTINUED:  Honduran President Ricardo Maduro </p><p>and President of Congress Pepe Lobo are calling for immediate </p><p>immunity reforms.  According to these two leaders, no one </p><p>should be above the law and that it is now long-past time to </p><p>bring a stop to the ease with which people escape prosecution </p><p>on grounds of immunity.  Despite these public declarations, </p><p>the jury remains out on whether or not Diaz will be made an </p><p>example of, or if he will escape punishment like so many </p><p>before him.  What is obvious is that this is not simply a </p><p>Honduran problem, but one with which the entire Central </p><p>America region will have to deal. Sadly, we do not expect </p><p>Honduras or its top political figures to lead the effort to </p><p>reform this ongoing abuse of legislative immunity.  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
