<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 KATHMANDU 000568 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, ASEC, CASC, PTER, PHUM, PREL, PINR, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: MAOIST STATEMENT THREATENS TOURISM INDUSTRY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Maoists Threaten Tourism Industry </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) For the first time, a leader of Nepal\'s Maoist </p><p>insurgency has issued explicit threats against Nepal\'s </p><p>tourism industry.  Maoist leader Baburam Bhattarai issued </p><p>the statement March 15.  (Text of statement follows as </p><p>paragraph 4.)  The statement called for the cadres to </p><p>"smash" hotels and travel businesses owned by prominent </p><p>Nepalese.  It warned tourists about the danger of being </p><p>caught in the crossfire, and advised foreign travelers to </p><p>take "precautionary measures" and not to visit Nepal </p><p>during the upcoming general strike called by the Maoists </p><p>for April 2-6.  Bhattarai\'s statement was the fourth </p><p>Maoist press release in a week. </p><p> </p><p>EAC Met </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) EAC met March 18 to discuss this and other issues </p><p>(Reftel).  Post will consult today and tomorrow with other </p><p>Embassies and GON officials to gauge their respective </p><p>postures and planned responses. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) The Maoists have so far refrained from attacks on </p><p>the tourism industry or against foreign nationals.  Post </p><p>takes Bhattarai\'s statement seriously, as it legitimates </p><p>tourist facilities as targets for his cadres.  At the same </p><p>time, the Maoists set a precedent last year, when they </p><p>issued a threat against development agencies but never </p><p>acted on it.  This year they seem both more daring, and </p><p>more desperate.  As the April 2 start date for their </p><p>general strike approaches, Post expects the level of </p><p>Maoist agitation - and corresponding threat - to increase. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Begin text of statement: </p><p> </p><p>OPEN LETTER TO FOREIGN TOURISTS VISITING NEPAL </p><p> </p><p>Dear Foreign Tourists, </p><p> </p><p>Welcome to the country of the roof of the world, and </p><p>warmest greetings from the materially poor but spiritually </p><p>rich people of Nepal! </p><p> </p><p>As you very well know, a revolutionary People\'s War (PW) </p><p>under the leadership of Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) </p><p>is raging in Nepal against a fascist monarchical state </p><p>since February 1996.  After getting severe drubbing from </p><p>the heroic People\'s Liberation Army (PLA) in every battle </p><p>front and losing almost all of the countryside to the </p><p>advancing revolutionary forces, the fast crumbling </p><p>reactionary regime headed by hated Gyanendra Shah has </p><p>imposed brutal military dictatorship under the guise of </p><p>the so-called state of emergency in the country since </p><p>November 2001. </p><p> </p><p>This last desperate act of the tottering regime to save </p><p>its skin has already backfired on itself and the mass </p><p>rebellion in the form of the PW has intensified further in </p><p>recent weeks and will reach a crescendo in the coming </p><p>days.  It is now obvious that two states, two armies, two </p><p>laws and two cultures, one representing a handful of </p><p>moribund parasitic classes and the other representing the </p><p>vast majority of the democratic and progressive working </p><p>people, are engaged in life and death struggle in the </p><p>country. </p><p> </p><p>The United Revolutionary People\'s Council (URPC) is an </p><p>embryonic Central People\'s Government Organizing Committee </p><p>in the form of a revolutionary united front headed by the </p><p>CPN (Maoist).  We, therefore, deem it our duty to acquaint </p><p>you with some of our basic positions and dispel some </p><p>canards spread against us by the old reactionary state </p><p>machinery.  What are we basically fighting for? </p><p> </p><p>We are fighting for a genuine people\'s democracy in the </p><p>country.  As you know, in the current political </p><p>dispensation in Nepal the real state power vests in the </p><p>feudal monarchy that effectively controls the royal army, </p><p>and the parliament is a mere showcase to embellish the </p><p>hereditary autocracy. </p><p> </p><p>Besides, the self-proclaimed current "king" Gyanendra and </p><p>his son Paras are known criminal gangsters who have </p><p>usurped the throne in a bloody coup d\'tat against King </p><p>Birendra last June 2001. </p><p> </p><p>Anybody familiar with the Nepalese history will agree that </p><p>the archaic institution of feudal monarchy is the root </p><p>cause and bulwark of socio-economic backwardness, abysmal </p><p>poverty, glaring inequality and all-round underdevelopment </p><p>plaguing the country, and its abolition is a minimum </p><p>precondition for ushering in genuine democracy, both </p><p>political and economic, in the country. </p><p> </p><p>When the English could wage war against their monarchy in </p><p>the 17th century, or the French in the 18th century, or </p><p>other civilized peoples in the 19th and 20th century, why </p><p>can\'t the Nepalese people do the same even in the 21st </p><p>century?  And are we against tourism industry in general </p><p>and foreign tourists in particular?  Nothing could be </p><p>farther from the truth. </p><p> </p><p>We are all for making maximum utilization of the natural </p><p>and cultural resources for the rapid economic development </p><p>and well-being of the country and the people.  And given </p><p>the exquisite natural beauty and rich cultural heritage of </p><p>the country, promotion of tourism obviously comes high in </p><p>the priority list of the future economic development </p><p>policy. </p><p> </p><p>As regards the false accusations of our xenophobic </p><p>inclinations and preference for a closed political system, </p><p>this is another example of sinister disinformation </p><p>campaigns deliberately launched by the counter- </p><p>revolutionary forces.  By ideological persuasion we are </p><p>for the ultimate withering away of all national and state </p><p>boundaries and creation of a classless and stateless </p><p>global community of people.  Rather the fake votaries of </p><p>"globalisation" of capital are mortally against the </p><p>globalisation of labor as well and hence, in essence, </p><p>against genuine all-round globalisation. </p><p> </p><p>Foreign tourists are, therefore, most welcome in the </p><p>country and will be so in future as well.  However, we </p><p>would like to draw your attention to the grossly lopsided </p><p>nature of current tourism industry in the country and </p><p>would advise you to take special precautionary measures </p><p>while traveling during the period of war. </p><p> </p><p>Firstly, the tourism industry in Nepal is monopolized by </p><p>the arch-reactionary Shah-Rana family and their close </p><p>courtiers (for example, all the five-star hotels and most </p><p>of the star hotels and travel business are either owned or </p><p>controlled by them), and most of the earnings from tourism </p><p>is said to flow back to foreign countries. </p><p> </p><p>Therefore it is quite imperative to smash this anti-people </p><p>and anti-national monopolistic structure of the tourism </p><p>industry and foreign tourists would be advised not to </p><p>patronize such tourism services (e.g., hotels, airlines, </p><p>buses etc.) particularly owned by the hated Shah-Rana </p><p>families. </p><p> </p><p>Secondly, during wartime the unassuming traveler can be </p><p>caught between the crossfire of the contending armies. </p><p>The foreign tourists are, therefore, kindly advised not to </p><p>venture into areas where active fighting is going on. </p><p>They are most welcome into the revolutionary base areas, </p><p>which are firmly under the control of the revolutionary </p><p>forces. </p><p> </p><p>And a few words to our honored guests from neighboring </p><p>India.  Though the reactionary state media cries hoarse </p><p>about our so-called anti-India posture, you need not be </p><p>unduly perturbed.  Despite the conspiracy of the ruling </p><p>classes of both the countries to drive wedges between the </p><p>people of Nepal and India, we are conscious of the common </p><p>destiny of the two peoples and are for developing a close </p><p>and cordial relations between the two.  You are, </p><p>therefore, most welcome to visit Nepal. </p><p> </p><p>And finally, in view of the 5-day long "Nepal bandh" (i.e. </p><p>general shutdown) from April 2 to April 6, 2002, and the </p><p>subsequent surcharged atmosphere in the aftermath, the </p><p>foreign tourists are well advised to skip the tour </p><p>itinerary, if any, for the said period.  We deeply regret </p><p>the inconveniences likely to cause to you all. </p><p> </p><p>Wishing you all the best for a future visit to a </p><p>democratic, progressive and prosperous people\'s republic </p><p>of Nepal, </p><p> </p><p>March 15, 2002 </p><p>Yours sincerely, </p><p>Dr. Baburam Bhattarai, Convenor, </p><p>United Revolutionary People\'s Council, Nepal </p><p> </p><p>End text of statement. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
