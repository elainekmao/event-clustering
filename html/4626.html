<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 002324 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS AND DS/IP/NEA </p><p>STATE ALSO PLEASE PASS USAID/DCHA/OFDA </p><p>USAID FOR ANE/AA GORDON WEST AND JIM BEVER </p><p>MANILA FOR USAID/DCHA/OFDA </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/REIDEL </p><p>TREASURY FOR GENERAL COUNSEL/DAUFHAUSER AND DAS JZARATE </p><p>TREASURY ALSO FOR OFAC/RNEWCOMB AND TASK FORCE ON TERRORIST </p><p>FINANCING </p><p>JUSTICE FOR OFFICE OF THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL/DLAUFMAN </p><p> </p><p>E.O 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PHUM, CASC, PGOV, IN, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL: MAOIST PROMISES GO UP IN SMOKE </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) KATHMANDU 2302 </p><p> </p><p>     (B) KATHMANDU 2316 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Summary:  Mere days after Maoist leaders called for </p><p>peace talks with the Government of Nepal (GON) (ref A), </p><p>three separate incidents raised serious questions about </p><p>whether they would honor their promises to halt attacks on </p><p>party workers and infrastructure.  Maoists killed a Nepali </p><p>Congress worker, vandalized the offices of an NGO, and </p><p>attacked hydropower equipment imported by the UK. </p><p>Systematic attacks on hydropower projects over the past year </p><p>have left thousands of Nepali homes and industries without </p><p>power. End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.   A December 3 statement by Maoist leader Prachanda </p><p>claimed that in order to facilitate talks with the GON, the </p><p>Maoists would cease attacks on infrastructure and members of </p><p>other political parties (ref A).  Though few analysts </p><p>accepted the statement at face value, several political </p><p>parties lauded it as a hopeful sign that the insurgents may </p><p>be willing to work for peace.  Even those hopes were </p><p>battered the next day, when Maoists launched simultaneous </p><p>attacks on two southern police posts (ref B) and continued </p><p>their usual pattern of violence. </p><p> </p><p>3. On Wednesday, December 4, a group of suspected Maoists </p><p>killed a Nepali Congress worker in southern Nawalparasi </p><p>district.  According to press reports, a group of three </p><p>young men on bicycles shot the 60-year-old political worker </p><p>at point-blank range.  Maoist insurgents had previously sent </p><p>him a warning letter.  Also on Wednesday, Maoists vandalized </p><p>the offices of Backward Society Education (BASE), an NGO </p><p>campaigning for the liberation of bonded laborers in the mid- </p><p>and far-western Terai regions.  According to an NGO </p><p>spokesperson, Maoists damaged 700,000 Nrs (9000 USD) worth </p><p>of property in the attack. </p><p> </p><p>4.  On Thursday, December 5, Maoists attacked two trucks </p><p>carrying hydropower generation equipment imported by a UK </p><p>development firm.  The trucks were bound for Jhankre mini </p><p>hydropower plant and would have helped provide power to </p><p>11,000 rural households.  The trucks and equipment, valued </p><p>at 25 million Nrs (200,000 USD) were completely destroyed in </p><p>the attack.  The Jhankre hydro plant had been completely </p><p>destroyed by the Maoists on October 8, in an attack that </p><p>also damaged a hydropower plant at Khimti.  Total damage </p><p>from the October attack is estimated at 7-10 million USD. </p><p> </p><p>5. The Norwegian government has pledged significant </p><p>financial support for the development and rehabilitation of </p><p>major hydroelectric power plants, and the reaction of </p><p>Norway\'s Ambassador to Nepal to the attacks was stern.  "The </p><p>rebel attack on the trucks and the generation equipment </p><p>makes no sense in light of Prachanda\'s statement that the </p><p>Maoists would cease attacks on basic infrastructures that </p><p>benefit the poor," she said, also lamenting the effect that </p><p>the attack was liable to have to possible development. </p><p>Despite previous expectations that the Khimti-I power plant </p><p>would entice more foreign investment in the hydropower </p><p>sector, she was clear that "Norwegian private investors will </p><p>not be interested unless there is peace." </p><p> </p><p>6.  Systematic Maoist attacks on hydropower infrastructure </p><p>have left thousands of rural homes without power and have </p><p>crippled industry in towns that rely on those facilities for </p><p>electricity.  Power to the Mid- and Far-Western regions has </p><p>been compromised since the insurgents destroyed a 132 KV </p><p>transmission line on the national power grid, forcing 14 </p><p>districts to resort to load-shedding during peak hours. </p><p>Industrial towns in Kailali and Baridya have been without </p><p>power for seven months, since the insurgents destroyed a </p><p>power sub-station serving the western districts. </p><p> </p><p>7. Witnesses have quoted the Maoist attackers calling their </p><p>attacks on hydropower facilities "symbolic strikes against </p><p>the government."  Nepal Electricity Authority is not </p><p>collecting data on the total cost of Maoist destruction, but </p><p>recently released estimates of damage from two attacks in </p><p>April demonstrate that the effects of the attacks are far </p><p>from symbolic for rural families.   Damage of the 12- </p><p>megawatt Jhimruk Power Plant in Pyuthan is estimated at 240 </p><p>million Nrs (3 million USD).   Approximately 4,000 local </p><p>households will be without power until repair of the plant </p><p>can be completed in an estimated 15 months.  The 5.1- </p><p>megawatt Andhikhola Project in central Syangja suffered 18 </p><p>million Nrs (231,000 USD) worth of damage, forcing 25,000 </p><p>residents of Syangja, Palpa and Gulmi districts to live in </p><p>the dark for one month.  Industries came to a standstill </p><p>after the plant was destroyed, according to locals, and many </p><p>small-scale factories were forced to lay off employees. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
