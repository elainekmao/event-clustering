<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KUWAIT 001283 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR NEA/FO, NEA/NGA, NEA/RA, NEA/ARP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/05/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MARR, PHUM, PINR, IZ, KU </p><p>SUBJECT: (C) SCENESETTER FOR GOK MINSTATE\'S VISIT TO </p><p>WASHINGTON </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: (U) AMBASSADOR RICHARD H. JONES; REASON: 1.5 (B,D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  GOK Minister of State for Foreign Affairs </p><p>and Acting Minister of Finance and Planning, Shaykh Dr. </p><p>Mohammed Sabah al-Salem al-Sabah, leaves Kuwait April 6 on a </p><p>whirlwind tour to Beijing, Moscow, Paris, London, Washington, </p><p>and New York.  To governments that opposed Operation Iraqi </p><p>Freedom, he will convey the GOK\'s disappointment.  In </p><p>Washington, he will express thanks for US leadership in </p><p>ridding the world of Saddam Hussein\'s regime, and emphasize </p><p>Kuwait\'s strong partnership with us.  To seize the </p><p>opportunity this visit provides to bolster the excellent </p><p>bilateral relationship, we recommend that our leaders at the </p><p>highest level tell Dr. Mohammed that we appreciate Kuwait\'s </p><p>contributions, that we are determined to set Iraq firmly on </p><p>the path to a stable, peaceful, prosperous future, and that </p><p>we are committed to our strategic relationship with Kuwait. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  SAYING THANK YOU:  The first part of every USG </p><p>message to Dr. Mohammed should be \'thank you.\'  The GOK\'s </p><p>cooperation has been indispensable in the run-up to, and </p><p>execution of, Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF).  The Kuwaitis </p><p>turned over to us more than half the territory of their </p><p>country, they diverted nearly all commercial traffic from the </p><p>port of Shuaiba, they gave us the use of a large percentage </p><p>of the country\'s sole commercial airport, they allowed us to </p><p>use three airbases and to build a new desert base (Camp </p><p>Udairi) comprising a C-130-capable airstrip, the world\'s </p><p>largest heliport and numerous other facilities.  They </p><p>extended a fuel pipeline to Ali al-Salem and Ahmed al-Jaber </p><p>airbases and Camp Udairi, and they are providing in excess of </p><p>USD 100 million per month in fuel as Assistance-In-Kind, </p><p>cutting off some of their long-term customers in the process. </p><p> Over the past several years, they built Camp Arifjan at </p><p>their own expense (over USD 50 million), and they turned it </p><p>over to us three years ahead of schedule during the build-up </p><p>to OIF.  They have responded favorably to our requests for </p><p>extra security for American personnel and facilities, </p><p>stretching their resources to the very limit.  The GOK has </p><p>also committed to providing Jordan 25,000 barrels per day of </p><p>free oil, to help compensate for its loss of Iraqi oil.  As a </p><p>first step in the reconstruction and humanitarian relief </p><p>effort, the GOK built a water pipeline to Umm Qasr and the </p><p>Kuwait Oil Company firefighting team was first on the scene </p><p>and extinguished several of the oil-well fires in southern </p><p>Iraq.  Today, Kuwait is the only Arab country where public </p><p>opinion is solidly with us.  The GOK and its people </p><p>understand that they have put all their eggs in our basket, </p><p>alienating themselves from the Arab world by serving as the </p><p>launching pad for the war.  Dr. Mohammed will be looking for </p><p>acknowledgment that his country is more than just a loyal </p><p>friend, it is a full partner in the coalition. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) REAFFIRMING OUR COMMITMENT:  Convinced that we are on </p><p>the verge of eliminating Saddam\'s regime, Dr. Mohammed will </p><p>place our post-war intentions at the top of his agenda.  He </p><p>understands and supports our goal of setting Iraq on a solid </p><p>foundation for a peaceful and prosperous future under rule of </p><p>law, with a representative government.  His concern will be </p><p>how we intend to do this and whether we have the staying </p><p>power to pull it off.  Also, expect him to highlight the </p><p>utility of involving the United Nations as much and as </p><p>quickly as possible, so as to show the world that we have no </p><p>intention of occupying Iraq or of using its resources for our </p><p>own ends. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Many Kuwaitis have begun to fret that we might turn </p><p>our back on this small country once we have a friendly regime </p><p>in Baghdad.  Dr. Mohammed will welcome assurances that the </p><p>United States considers its relationship with Kuwait to be </p><p>strategic, regardless of developments in Iraq or elsewhere in </p><p>the region.   Kuwait also attaches great importance to its </p><p>ties with Saudi Arabia, and has been dismayed by reported </p><p>strains in the US-Saudi relationship.  Reaffirmation of the </p><p>strategic nature of our relations with the Kingdom would be </p><p>well received. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) PALESTINIAN ISSUE:  While Kuwait would like to see </p><p>progress towards resolving the Israeli-Palestinian issue, it </p><p>has never forgiven Arafat for siding with Saddam in 1990. </p><p>This mistrust has been deepened by the pro-Iraqi stance that </p><p>has again been evident in the Palestinian territories this </p><p>year.  The GOK\'s major contributions to OIF, and the </p><p>political risk it is taking in siding with us against an Arab </p><p>regime, mean that it feels committed, but not beholden, to </p><p>the United States.  We are not optimistic that the GOK will </p><p>respond positively to fresh appeals for aid to the </p><p>Palestinians at this time.  It will much prefer to focus its </p><p>energies on Iraq and would be more likely to accept an </p><p>invitation to join the core group on Iraqi reconstruction </p><p>(although it believes loans and investment, not grant aid, </p><p>should be the preferred means of financing reconstruction). </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) ARTICLE 98:  As this is written, we are awaiting </p><p>MFA\'s reaction to the latest draft Article 98 agreement.  Dr. </p><p>Mohammed has expressed the hope that he could sign the </p><p>agreement with the Secretary while in Washington.  We will </p><p>continue to press for closure, but recommend that the </p><p>Department also engage asap with Kuwait\'s Ambassador Shaykh </p><p>Salim to help bring this issue to closure in time. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) BOEING:  It would be useful for senior USG </p><p>interlocutors to urge the GOK to come to closure with the </p><p>Boeing-led consortium on the Memorandum of Agreement for the </p><p>Apache offset program.  Dr. Mohammed is responsible for this </p><p>issue in his capacity as acting Minister of Finance. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS (TIP):  Dr. Mohammed knows </p><p>Kuwait will probably be added to the State Dept.\'s TIP Report </p><p>this year.  He seems interested to learn more about what </p><p>other GCC states have done, and we are engaged with MFA on </p><p>that issue.  There is no reason why the GOK cannot make </p><p>progress in this area fairly quickly if it understands the </p><p>importance to the USG.  A word to the wise from senior </p><p>officials in Washington could help. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) BIO NOTE: Dr. Mohammed himself is our key </p><p>interlocutor in the Kuwaiti leadership.  Son, grandson, and </p><p>great-grandson of Amirs, former Ambassador to the United </p><p>States, with a PhD from Harvard, he is the man on whom the </p><p>most senior (and much older) members of the ruling family </p><p>rely to explain American interests and intentions.  He </p><p>personally stood up to respond to abusive and threatening </p><p>language from Iraq\'s delegation head at the March 4 OIC </p><p>Summit, Revolutionary Command Council Vice Chairman Izzat </p><p>Ibrahim.  This has increased his popular standing </p><p>significantly in Kuwait, where all the outpourings of emotion </p><p>during this crisis have been strongly pro-US. </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
