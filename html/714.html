(SECRET - ENTIRE TEXT) </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY.  IN A JANUARY 26 MEETING, SAUDI FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER SAUD AL-FAISAL TOLD NEA ASSISTANT SECRETARY </p><p>PELLETREAU THAT IRAN HAD BEEN PRESSURING THE SAG FOR AN </p><p>IMPROVEMENT IN RELATIONS, BUT THE SAG HAD SEEN NO </p><p>INDICATION THAT IMPROVING RELATIONS WOULD PRODUCE A </p><p>STABILIZING SITUATION.  HE SAID THE SAG WAS CONCERNED </p><p>ABOUT IRANIAN MEDDLING IN BAHRAIN.  PELLETREAU SAID THE </p><p>U.S. WAS CONCERNED ABOUT IRAN\'S SUPPORT OF SUBVERSIVE </p><p>ACTIVITIES AND ITS RECENT PURCHASE OF A RUSSIAN NUCLEAR </p><p>REACTOR.  HE SAID U.S. EFFORTS TO DENY IRAN NEW CREDIT </p><p>WERE HAVING SOME EFFECT.  SAUD SAID THAT HE HAD RECENTLY </p><p>HEARD THAT THERE WERE DIVISIONS WITHIN HIZBALLAH, AND </p><p>SUGGESTED THAT OUR INTELLIGENCE SERVICES HAVE AN </p><p>INFORMATION EXCHANGE ON THIS SUBJECT.  PELLETREAU </p><p>AGREED.  (OTHER SUBJECTS SEPTELS.)  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  IN THE LATE AFTERNOON OF JANUARY 26, ASSISTANT </p><p>SECRETARY PELLETREAU AND FOREIGN MINISTER SAUD MET AT </p><p>SAUD\'S HOME TO CONTINUE THEIR JANUARY 25 MEETING. </p><p>DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER AL-KURDI SAT IN ON THE SAUDI </p><p>SIDE AS NOTETAKER.  AMBASSADOR AND ACTING POLCOUNS </p><p>(NOTETAKER) ACCOMPANIED PELLETREAU. </p><p> </p><p>4.  SAUD RAISED THE ISSUE OF IRAN BY SAYING THAT THE </p><p>IRANIANS WERE CONSTANTLY CONTACTING THE SAG OUTSIDE </p><p>DIPLOMATIC CHANNELS AND THROUGH THIRD PARTIES RELAYING </p><p>THE MESSAGE THAT THE IRANIAN GOVERNMENT DOES NOT </p><p>UNDERSTAND WHY THERE HAS BEN NO IMPROVEMENT IN </p><p>SAUDI-IRANIAN RELATIONS, ESECIALLY SINCE THE IRANIAN </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER HAS VSITED SAUDI ARABIA TWICE.  SAUD </p><p>SAID THAT THE SAG HAS SEEN NO CHANGE IN IRANIAN POLICY </p><p>THAT WOULD INDICATE THAT AN IMPROVEMENT OF RELATIONS </p><p>WOULD PRODUCE A STABILIZING SITUATION.  ALSO, THERE WERE </p><p>UNRESOLVED REGIONAL ISSUES SUCH AS THE "THREE ISLANDS" </p><p>DISPUTE WITH THE UAE AND IRANIAN MEDDLING IN BAHRAIN. </p><p> </p><p>IRANIAN INVOLVEMENT IN BAHRAIN </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5.  PELLETREAU ASKED SAUD HOW SERIOUS HE THOUGHT THE </p><p>SITUATION IN BAHRAIN WAS.  SAUD SAID, "VERY SERIOUS." </p><p>THE SHIA IN BAHRAIN LOOK TO QOM FOR RELIGIOUS </p><p>LEADERSHIP, AND SINCE THE TIME OF THE SHAH, IRAN HAS </p><p>MADE TROUBLE FOR BAHRAIN.  HE SAID THAT IRAN DENIES IT </p><p>IS INVOLVED IN BAHRAIN.  IT HAS SENT MESSAGES TO THE </p><p>SAUDIS AND BAHRAINIS THROUGH THIRD PARTIES THAT IT WOULD </p><p>"DO ANYTHING" TO PROVE THAT IT WAS NOT INVOLVED IN </p><p>BAHRAIN.  SAUD SAID BAHRAIN WAS IN CONTACT WITH IRAN. </p><p> </p><p>6.  SAUD SAID THE BAHRAINI DISSIDENTS WERE MAKING </p><p>EXTENSIVE USE OF THE MEDIA.  INTERNATIONAL MEDIA </p><p>BROADCASTS INTO BAHRAIN TREAT THE DISTURBANCES AS IF </p><p>THEY WERE THE ONLY EVENTS GOING ON IN THE WORLD.  SUCH </p><p>MEDIA SCRUTINY WAS BAD FOR BAHRAIN\'S ECONOMY, WHICH </p><p>DEPENDS ON TOURISM AND BUSINESS.  THE ANSWER DID NOT LIE </p><p>IN DESTROYING THE COUNTRY.  HE HOPED WE WOULD BE </p><p>UNDERSTANDING OF BAHRAIN\'S SITUATION. </p><p> </p><p>7.  PELLETREAU SAID THAT WE HAD TOLD THE BAHRAINIS THAT </p><p>WE THOUGHT THEY WERE HANDLING THE SITUATION WITH </p><p>RESTRAINT.  THEY WERE A COUNTRY FRIENDLY TO THE U.S. AND </p><p>THE KINGDOM AND REQUIRED SUPPORT.  SAUD SAID, "BAHRAIN </p><p>NEEDS HELP NOW."  HE SAID IRAN NEEDS TO BE SENT A </p><p>MESSAGE THAT IT SHOULD NOT MEDDLE IN BAHRAIN\'S INTERNAL </p><p>AFFAIRS. </p><p> </p><p>OTHER IRANIAN SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITIES </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  PELLETREAU SAID THAT IRAN WAS DOING A NUMBER OF </p><p>THINGS IT SHOULD NOT BE DOING.  IT WAS TRYING TO ACQUIRE </p><p>WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION.  IT HAD CLOSE RELATIONS </p><p>WITH SUDAN.  IT WAS CARRYING OUT WIDER SUBVERSIVE </p><p>ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS CONDUCTING ACTIONS AGAINST EGYPT AND </p><p>SUPPORTING HIZBALLAH AND ITS TERRORIST ACTIVITIES. </p><p> </p><p>9.  SAUD SAID THAT HE HAD HEARD THAT THERE MAY BE </p><p>DIVISIONS WITHIN HIZBALLAH.  THERE ARE THOSE WHO WANT A </p><p>CLOSER RELATIONSHIP WITH IRAN, AND OTHERS WHO WANT </p><p>HIZBALLAH TO BE MORE INDEPENDENT.  HE SAID THAT AN </p><p>INFORMATION EXCHANGE ON THIS SUBJECT WOULD BE USEFUL, </p><p>AND THAT OUR INTELLIGENCE SERVICES SHOULD GET IN TOUCH </p><p>WITH EACH OTHER.  PELLETREAU AGREED. </p><p> </p><p>IRANIAN/RUSSIAN RELATIONS </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  PELLETREAU SAID THAT THE U.S. HAS BEEN IN CONTACT </p><p>WITH RUSSIA ABOUT ITS RELATIONS WITH IRAN, AND HAD </p><p>OBTAINED A RUSSIAN COMMITMENT NOT TO ENTER INTO ANY NEW </p><p>MILITARY CONTRACTS WITH IRAN.  HOWEVER, WE DO NOT KNOW </p><p>ALL THE DETAILS OF RUSSIA\'S CURRENT CONTRACTS.  SAUD </p><p>SAID THAT HE HAD HEARD THAT THE CONTRACTS WERE WORTH USD </p><p>4 BILLION.  HE LAUGHED AND SAID THAT RUSSIAN EQUIPMENT </p><p>WAS CHEAPER THAN U.S. EQUIPMENT.  THUS, USD 4 BILLION </p><p>OUGHT TO BUY QUITE A BIT.  PELLETREAU SAID THAT EVEN </p><p>THAT LARGE AMOUNT OF EQUIPMENT WON\'T COME CLOSE TO WHAT </p><p>IRAN THINKS IT NEEDS. </p><p> </p><p>11.  PELLETREAU SAID THAT WE HAD ALSO TALKED TO RUSSIA </p><p>ABOUT ITS CONTRACT TO BUILD A NUCLEAR REACTOR AS </p><p>BUSHEIR.  EVEN THOUGH IT WOULD COME UNDER IAEA </p><p>SAFEGUARDS, IT WOULD GIVE IRAN TECHNOLOGY IT COULD USE </p><p>FOR NON-PEACEFUL PURPOSES.  SAUD SAID THAT HE HAD </p><p>UNDERSTOOD THAT IRAN\'S OTHER REACTORS WERE UNDER IAEA </p><p>SAFEGUARDS.  PELLETREAU SAID THAT WAS TRUE, BUT WE KNEW </p><p>THAT THERE WAS MORE TO IRAN\'S NUCLEAR PROGRAM THAN WHAT </p><p>THE IAEA INSPECTORS SAW. </p><p> </p><p>12.  SAUD SAID THAT THE RUSSIANS DID NOT GIVE THE SAG </p><p>UNCONDITIONAL ASSURANCES WHEN IT RAISED RUSSIA\'S SALES </p><p>TO IRAN.  THE RUSSIANS SAID THAT FOR ECONOMIC PURPOSES </p><p>THEY HAD TO MAKE SALES.  HOWEVER, SAUDI ARABIA IS NOT </p><p>GOING TO BUY RUSSIAN GOODS. </p><p> </p><p>RESTRICTING NEW CREDIT </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  PELLETREAU SAID THAT WE HAVE HAD LIMITED SUCCESS IN </p><p>OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH THE G-7 COUNTRIES ABOUT NOT </p><p>PROVIDING NEW CREDITS TO IRAN.  GERMANY HAD NOT PROVIDED </p><p>NEW CREDITS, BUT HAD PAID THE GERMAN COMPANIES TO WHOM </p><p>IRAN OWED MONEY, AND THEN RENEGOTIATED IRAN\'S PAYMENT </p><p>TERMS.  IRAN HAD BET THAT OIL PRICES WOULD REMAIN HIGH. </p><p>NOW, IT WAS HAVING PROBLEMS.  AS A RESULT, OUR POLICY OF </p><p>RESTRICTING CREDIT TO IRAN WAS CAUSING IT TO CUT BACK ON </p><p>ITS MILITARY PROCUREMENT. </p><p> </p><p>EU\'S "CRITICAL DIALOGUE" </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>14.  PELLETREAU SAID THAT WE HAVE ASKED THE EU WHAT </p><p>RESULTS IT HAS TO SHOW FOR ITS "CRITICAL DIALOGUE" WITH </p><p>IRAN.  THE EUROPEANS TELL US THEY ARE STRENGTHENING THE </p><p>MODERATES.  HOWEVER, THERE DO NOT APPEAR TO BE ANY </p><p>MODERATES WHEN IT COMES TO IRAN\'S EXTERNAL POLICY.  SAUD </p><p>AGREED AND SAID THAT EVEN IRAN\'S INTERNAL POLICIES ARE </p><p>RESTRICTIVE, INCLUDING AREAS SUCH AS ITS BANKING SYSTEM. </p><p> </p><p>MABUS </p><p></p></div>
