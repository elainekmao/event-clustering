<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L  ROME 002956 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE PASS USDA FOR FAS ITP/MACKE AND OFSTS/RICHEY </p><p>STATE PASS USTR </p><p>GENEVA FOR USTR </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/30/2013 </p><p>TAGS: EAGR, ETRD, IT, PGOV, TBIO, UN </p><p>SUBJECT: GOI MINISTERS ASSERT SAFETY AND IMPORTANCE OF </p><p>BIOTECH PRODUCTS </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Economic Minister-Counselor Scott Kilner for reasons 1.5 </p><p> (b) (d) </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary. At the annual assembly of Assobiotec </p><p>(Italy,s national association of biotechnology companies) </p><p>held in Rome on June 10, 2003, Minister of Productive </p><p>Activities Antonio Marzano and Minister of Health Girolamo </p><p>Sirchia addressed the importance of the sector to Italy,s </p><p>future.  They stressed the safety of biotech and the </p><p>importance of biotechnology to the developing world.  Dr. </p><p>Adriano de Maio, Rector of LUISS University, and Dr. Claudio </p><p>Bordignon, Scientific Director of Fondazione San Raffaele </p><p>described the current plight of biotechnology research and </p><p>development capacity in Italy.  Despite these welcome words, </p><p>there is still no consensus about biotech policy within the </p><p>GOI cabinet, and we are not confident of gaining a policy </p><p>breakthrough in the short term. End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) CDA Skodon delivered opening remarks focusing mainly </p><p>on the US trade dispute with the European Union over the </p><p>moratorium on Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs).  He </p><p>cited the fact that even the Commission recognizes that there </p><p>are no known negative effects on human health and that the </p><p>moratorium prevents developing countries from reaping the </p><p>benefits of innovative agricultural technologies.  In </p><p>addition, he expressed his hope that the Italian Presidency </p><p>of the EU will take the lead to give European consumers the </p><p>right to choose to buy biotech products. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) Minister of Productive Activities Marzano discussed </p><p>the costs and benefits of biotechnology, citing benefits such </p><p>as new drugs, new vaccines, new therapies, and new diagnostic </p><p>instruments.  He stressed the fact that the drawbacks of </p><p>biotechnology have not been substantiated and are founded on </p><p>political references and anti-American feelings.  He </p><p>emphasized that we face death from starvation in the </p><p>developing world if we turn away from agricultural </p><p>biotechnology.  In addition, Italy and Europe risk becoming </p><p>consumers, rather than producers, of biotechnology research. </p><p>He stressed the need to keep Italian researchers in Italy and </p><p>to attract foreign researchers. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Marzano,s remarks were apparently influenced by a </p><p>June 4 internal memo on agricultural biotech from Director </p><p>General for Commercial Agreements Amedeo Teti to Vice </p><p>Minister of Productive Activities (Foreign Trade) Adolfo </p><p>Urso.  Teti,s paper, a copy of which was obtained by the </p><p>Embassy (please strictly protect), reiterates familiar themes </p><p>covered in recent bilateral discussions, including the </p><p>possibility that the U.S. request for WTO consultations on </p><p>the EU moratorium on biotech approvals could spur the GOI to </p><p>adopt a unified position on agricultural biotech.  The flip </p><p>side of a unified policy, according to Teti, would be the </p><p>GOI,s improved ability to manage the issue during its EU </p><p>presidency, especially given the upcoming WTO ministerial </p><p>meeting in Cancun.  He also called for the GOI to work </p><p>towards formulating a U.S.-EU compromise on ag biotech, in </p><p>which a less restrictive EU policy would be matched by U.S. </p><p>support for greater protection of geographic indications </p><p>(though Teti acknowledged continued U.S. opposition to </p><p>expandng GI protections). Teti further advocated greater GOI </p><p>leadership on ag biotech to make Italy compettive with other </p><p>more pro-GMO EU member states. Te expected results would </p><p>include more foreign inestment in the Italian biotech </p><p>sector, and incresed biotech research and development by </p><p>Italian SMEs (which, in contrast to large corporations, </p><p>geerally cannot shift biotech activity to more </p><p>bioech-friendly areas outside of the EU). </p><p> </p><p>5.(U) Miister of Health Sirchia addressed the Assobiotec </p><p>meeting on the lack of evidence of any harm to human health </p><p>of agricultural biotechnology.  He notedthat genetic </p><p>modification has happened naturallyover hundreds of years </p><p>and there is no proof tha genetic modification over </p><p>milliseconds has a diferent effect.  Protective measures </p><p>should only b considered when the evidence could prove </p><p>otherwse. Minister Sirchia also spoke of the importance f </p><p>linking industry to research in universities t make better </p><p>use of the resources allocated to tis sector. </p><p> </p><p>6.(U) Dr. Adriano De Maio and Dr. Cladio Bordignon both </p><p>discussed the more academic apects of the biotech sector </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>stating that there is very little funding for biotech </p><p>research activities in Italy.  A fundamental problem is the </p><p>lack of a concentration of and funding for research </p><p>centers--centers of excellence like the NIH and NSF in the </p><p>U.S.  These centers would, in their opinion, give a </p><p>much-needed focus for biotech research and increase </p><p>efficiency.  The importance of synthesis between academics, </p><p>research, and industry was also highlighted. </p><p> </p><p>7.(C) Embassy comment: On a day when Italian journalists were </p><p>on strike and coverage minimal, the two most pro-biotech </p><p>ministers of the Berlusconi government preached to an </p><p>audience of the converted. In addition, a half-dozen or so </p><p>Italian Parliamentarians and a number of representatives from </p><p>scientific institutions were identified by name.  The </p><p>ministers provided a welcome focus on the impact of </p><p>unreasonable concerns about biotech products on funding for </p><p>biotech research and, as importantly, the sorry state of </p><p>biotechnology companies in Italy, which are near dead last in </p><p>Europe in number and amount of investment capital.  Still, we </p><p>see little evidence that a breakthrough on GOI biotech policy </p><p>is likely due to continued opposition by other members of the </p><p>government, notably Agricultural Minister Alemanno.  We </p><p>therefore hold out no great hope for decisive Italian </p><p>leadership during the upcoming EU Presidency. </p><p> </p><p>8.(U) This cable was prepared by Science Section intern Lisa </p><p>George. </p><p> </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p>Sembler </p><p>NNNN </p><p>	2003ROME02956 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
