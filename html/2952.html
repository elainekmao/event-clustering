<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 002423 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/15/2007 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, ECON, ETRD, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: SADDAM\'S REGIME PROSPERING AND CONFIDENT ACCORDING </p><p>TO LONGTIME JOURNALIST </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edward Gnehm.  Reasons 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (S) Journalist Peter Arnett (please protect throughout) </p><p>shared with the Ambassador May 13 impressions from a </p><p>just-completed three-week tour of Iraq.  The images he </p><p>conveyed -- full flights into and out of Baghdad, markets </p><p>better stocked with products than before, huge, </p><p>recently-completed ornate Mosques, and the self-assured words </p><p>of Tariq Aziz and other GOI officials -- are of a </p><p>self-confident regime that believes it can withstand any </p><p>potential U.S. attack short of a full-scale ground invasion. </p><p>Baghdad, he noted, was full of European and other </p><p>international "solidarity activists" who had come to Iraq to </p><p>take part in Saddam\'s 65th Birthday celebrations.  He </p><p>observed that the GOI no longer looks to the international </p><p>media to generate public pressure to stop any U.S. action. </p><p>Instead, its active -- and in its own view successful -- </p><p>courting of its Arab neighbors and European NGOs is building </p><p>opposition to any U.S. action.  He also noted that Uday </p><p>apparently has recently become a Shi\'a, and has taken to </p><p>writing long tracts in his newspaper Babel on the virtues of </p><p>the Shi\'a sect.  Whether this indicates a change in his </p><p>notoriously libertine lifestyle remains to be seen. End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p>Full Planes, Busy Markets, New Mosques, and Plenty </p><p>of Interested International Businesspeople </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) Arnett observed that throughout his trip, it was clear </p><p>that Iraq is much more prosperous now than it has been at any </p><p>time since Desert Storm.  He flew into and out of Baghdad </p><p>from Amman, and also flew internally from Baghdad to Mosul in </p><p>the north and to Basra in the south.  All the flights, he </p><p>noted, were filled with businesspeople, Iraqi families, and </p><p>large numbers of Shi\'a pilgrims from other countries.  The </p><p>Iraqi planes on the internal flights were all in good repair, </p><p>and Saddam International Airport was "spic and span, </p><p>well-maintained, and bustling with flights to and from </p><p>everywhere."  He said he saw similar levels of activity at </p><p>Baghdad\'s bus terminals, with new buses departing regularly </p><p>for destinations all over the country. </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) A visit to Saddam City in Baghdad (which Arnett views </p><p>as a bellwether neighborhood) revealed that the quantity and </p><p>variety of goods found in working class markets have greatly </p><p>improved.  The expanded availability of goods is not limited </p><p>to upper class neighborhoods like Mansour, he said, but </p><p>clearly extends to other levels of society as well.  (Note: </p><p>UN officials he met said that supplies of medicines obtained </p><p>under O-F-F are, for the most part, meeting overall needs. </p><p>That said, the officials noted that there have been problems </p><p>importing some specialized medicines due to sanctions </p><p>restrictions on potential dual-use items.)  He also recounted </p><p>visiting an Iraqi family he has known for more than 10 years, </p><p>noting how their economic situation had improved </p><p>significantly.  The father is now making relatively good </p><p>money as a driver on the trade routes back and forth to </p><p>Syria.  Quite striking, as well, were the huge and ornate new </p><p>mosques that had been completed or are still under </p><p>construction in various parts of Baghdad.  Many Iraqis appear </p><p>to approve of and appreciate the new mosques, he said: "it </p><p>gives them a place to go." </p><p> </p><p>4. (S) Just as striking, in his view, has been the </p><p>proliferation of international business people in Baghdad </p><p>compared to the numbers he had seen on previous visits.  As </p><p>an example, he noted that delegations from both Indonesia and </p><p>Malaysia were negotiating with the Iraqis over oil </p><p>development projects in the Western Desert.  A senior Iraqi </p><p>official boasted to him that Iraq would soon be shown to have </p><p>the world\'s largest oil reserves.  This is, and would </p><p>continue to be, an irresistable lure to international </p><p>business.  Trade Minister Mohammed Salih, he noted, "made a </p><p>big issue of saying that Iraq very much wanted to rebuild its </p><p>trade relationship with the U.S. under the 1988 trade </p><p>agreement" and said he regretted that politics had thus far </p><p>prevented that from happening. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p>Saddam\'s Birthday Bash: Organized But Genuine Enthusiasm </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (S) Arnett\'s three-week visit coincided with Iraq\'s </p><p>commemoration of Saddam\'s 65th Birthday.  In total he </p><p>"endured" 22 hours of celebratory parades in Baghdad, Tikrit </p><p>and Mosul in honor of this occasion.  While the government </p><p>obviously instructed and organized the populace to </p><p>participate (bussing people in, for example, and sending </p><p>notices instructing people which event to attend), many </p><p>Iraqis took part of their own volition.  Much of this stems </p><p>from Saddam\'s emotional appeal as an Arab hero who fearlessly </p><p>stands up to America.  Part of it is a result of the largesse </p><p>Saddam bestows on those who are loyal.  In either case, the </p><p>journalist noted, the enthusiasm of many Iraqis came off to </p><p>him as genuine. </p><p> </p><p>6. (S) Arnett also passed on comments from Tariq Aziz that </p><p>reflected the regime\'s judgement that the people\'s support </p><p>is, in fact, real.  Aziz told him that the Government had </p><p>distributed "hundreds of thousands of weapons" into the hands </p><p>of the people.  If they were truly concerned about the </p><p>loyalty of average Iraqis, they would never have done this. </p><p>Americans and others "who may believe that the Iraqi </p><p>population is seething with rage against the regime are </p><p>sorely mistaken," Aziz said.  Aziz added: "The U.S. is </p><p>wasting its time and money with these so-called opposition </p><p>groups.  The relationship between the Government and the </p><p>people is a healthy one.  We are not afraid.  We are sure of </p><p>their patriotism."  Fondly recalling evenings spent in packed </p><p>cafes along the waterways and marveling over the many </p><p>positive changes in Iraq since his last visit several years </p><p>ago, Arnett opined that as time goes by regime change will be </p><p>more difficult, saying "each month (sees) more trade, more </p><p>prosperity, and more solidarity." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>No Relationship With UBL </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>7. (S) In the same interview, Tariq Aziz emphatically denied </p><p>any cooperation between Iraq and "terrorists," noting that </p><p>Palestinian "freedom fighters" fall into a different </p><p>category.  He told Arnett that "we don\'t work with </p><p>terrorists.  We don\'t need them.  We never recognized the </p><p>Taliban.  The attack on the WTC was the act of a desperate </p><p>individual.  Governments don\'t do things like that.  We are a </p><p>revolutionary government power and we would have been subject </p><p>to nuclear attack if we did such a thing." </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>"International Solidarity" Activists </p><p>More Effective Advocates than the Media </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (S) Saddam\'s birthday and the 34-nation "Baghdad </p><p>Conference" that had also taken place drew large numbers of </p><p>"international solidarity activists" from around the world. </p><p>The Iraqis, Arnett noted, appear to have settled on a </p><p>strategy of building grassroots support for Iraq in Europe </p><p>and elsewhere by courting and (in all likelihood, he noted) </p><p>financing these groups.  They see these organizations as </p><p>effective pressure centers that, over time, will be able to </p><p>affect their own governments\' policies toward Iraq and erode </p><p>support for, and participation in, any U.S.-led action.  This </p><p>has been especially true of its efforts in Arab countries. </p><p>He contrasted the energy and resources the GOI is devoting to </p><p>these groups to the diminished role the Iraqis have assigned </p><p>to the international media.  He noted, "their experience in </p><p>1991 showed that our reporting did nothing to stop the U.S.\'s </p><p>decision to launch Desert Storm." </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>A New, More Pious and Shi\'a Uday? </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (S)  One curiosity Arnett remarked on was Uday\'s recent </p><p>public conversion to Shi\'a Islam.  Uday has been utilizing </p><p>his newspaper "Babel" to pontificate on the virtues of Shi\'a </p><p>Islam.  This development has not gone unnoticed among Iraqi </p><p>Shi\'a.  What it ultimately portends, how most Iraqis view it, </p><p>and whether Uday has permanently forsaken his previously </p><p>notorious libertine lifestyle, Arnett jokingly remarked, </p><p>remain to be seen. </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
