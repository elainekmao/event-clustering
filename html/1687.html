REASONS: 1.5 </p><p>(B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC) PRESIDENT MORGAN </p><p>TSVANGIRAI APPEARED BEFORE HIGH COURT JUDGE MOSES CHINHENGO ON </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>MAY 7 TO FACE CHARGES -- UNDER THE COLONIAL-ERA LAW AND ORDER </p><p>MAINTENANCE ACT -- OF TERRORISM AND SABOTAGE AND OF INCITING </p><p>PUBLIC VIOLENCE.  AS REPORTED REFTEL, THE CHARGES REFER TO </p><p>TSVANGIRAI\'S STATEMENT AT A POLITICAL RALLY LAST SEPTEMBER 30 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>THAT PRESIDENT MUGABE WOULD BE REMOVED VIOLENTLY IF HE DID NOT </p><p>CHOOSE TO GO PEACEFULLY.  THE STANDING ROOM ONLY CROWD INCLUDED </p><p>SENIOR MDC OFFICIALS, FOREIGN AND LOCAL JOURNALISTS, EMBASSY\'S </p><p>POLITICAL SECTION CHIEF AND HIS FSN ASSISTANT, AND A RANGE OF </p><p>OTHER INTERESTED OBSERVERS.  DURING MOST OF THE HOUR-LONG </p><p>HEARING, A GROUP OF APPROXIMATELY 100 MOSTLY YOUNG MEN STOOD ON </p><p>THE STREET OUTSIDE CHANTING PRO-MDC SLOGANS, UNDER THE WATCHFUL </p><p>EYE OF A LARGE CONTINGENT OF RIOT POLICE. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) THE HEARING DID NOT DEAL WITH THE SUBSTANCE OF THE </p><p>CHARGES.  RATHER, JUDGE CHINHENGO FOCUSED EXCLUSIVELY ON THE </p><p>REQUEST BY TSVANGIRAI\'S LEAD ATTORNEY, CHRIS ANDERSEN, THAT THE </p><p>CASE BE REFERRED TO THE SUPREME COURT FOR A DETERMINATION OF </p><p>WHETHER THE LAW AND ORDER MAINTENANCE ACT (LOMA) IS CONSISTENT </p><p>WITH ZIMBABWE\'S CONSTITUTION.  ANDERSEN CONTENDED THAT THE LOMA </p><p>ARTICLES UNDER WHICH TSVANGIRAI IS CHARGED -- 51 AND 58 -- </p><p>VIOLATE THE CONSTITUTION BY IGNORING THE GUARANTEE OF FREEDOM OF </p><p>EXPRESSION, BY PLACING THE ONUS ON THE DEFENDANT TO PROVE HIS </p><p>INNOCENCE, AND BY DISREGARDING THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROTECTION </p><p>AGAINST EXCESSIVE PUNISHMENT, AS THE MAXIMUM PENALTY FOR </p><p>CONVICTION IN THIS CASE IS LIFE IMPRISONMENT.  PROSECUTOR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01536  071552Z </p><p>NATHANIEL SIBANDA CONTENDED THAT THE CASE SHOULD PROCEED TO TRIAL </p><p>IMMEDIATELY, GIVEN THE VERY SERIOUS CHARGES AND THE NEED FOR </p><p>GOVERNMENT TO MAKE CLEAR THAT, IN HIS WORDS, CALLING FOR THE </p><p>VIOLENT OVERTHROW OF A LAWFULLY-ELECTED LEADER IS NOT PERMISSIBLE </p><p>IN A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) AFTER DELIBERATING FOR THREE HOURS, JUDGE CHINHENGO </p><p>ANNOUNCED HIS INTENTION TO REFER THE CASE TO THE SUPREME COURT, </p><p>WHICH SHOULD, HE SAID, WEIGH IN BECAUSE THE CASE IS A MATTER OF </p><p>SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC INTEREST.  IN ADDITION, CHINHENGO DECLARED, </p><p>THE NATION\'S HIGHEST COURT SHOULD RULE ONCE AND FOR ALL ON THE </p><p>CONSTITUTIONALITY OF LOMA, A MUCH-CRITICIZED LAW -- DRAFTED, </p><p>IRONICALLY, BY THE IAN SMITH REGIME  -- WHICH GAVE THE COLONIAL </p><p>GOVERNMENT SWEEPING POWERS IN ITS EFFORT TO SUPPRESS BLACK </p><p>NATIONALISTS. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) CHINHENGO\'S RULING MUST BE CONSIDERED A SMALL BUT </p><p>IMPORTANT VICTORY FOR TSVANGIRAI, AS THE JUDGE ESSENTIALLY AGREED </p><p>WITH HIS LEGAL TEAM\'S CONTENTION THAT THE BASIS FOR THE CHARGES </p><p>AGAINST HIM MIGHT BE SUPERSEDED BY THE CONSTITUTION.  THIS IS A </p><p>CRUCIAL TEST CASE, BOTH BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT REGULARLY USES THE </p><p>LAW AND ORDER MAINTENANCE ACT TO INTIMIDATE THE POLITICAL </p><p>OPPOSITION AND BECAUSE MANY OBSERVERS INTERPRET THE CONSTITUTION </p><p>AS PROHIBITING CONVICTED FELONS FROM RUNNING FOR THE PRESIDENCY, </p><p>ALTHOUGH THE DOCUMENT IS VAGUE ON THIS POINT.  IT IS IMPOSSIBLE </p><p>TO PREDICT WHAT THE SUPREME COURT WILL DO.  IT COULD DECIDE TO </p><p>REFER THE CASE BACK TO THE HIGH COURT FOR TRIAL.  ALTHOUGH THE </p><p>CHARGES IN THIS CASE ARE CLEARLY POLITICALLY MOTIVATED -- </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  01536  071552Z </p><p>TSVANGIRAI WAS NOT ATTEMPTING TO INCITE VIOLENCE OR ENGAGING IN </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>TERRORISM OR SABOTAGE -- THE COURT MIGHT BE RELUCTANT TO STRIKE </p><p>DOWN BOTH ARTICLES IN FULL, FOR FEAR THAT DOING SO MIGHT REMOVE </p><p>AN IMPORTANT LEGAL MECHANISM FOR USE AGAINST GENUINE PERPETRATORS </p><p>OF THESE CRIMES.  ON THE OTHER HAND, AN EXAMINATION OF THE </p><p>INTENTIONS OF THE ORIGINAL DRAFTERS OF THE LOMA MIGHT MAKE THE </p><p>JUSTICES INCLINED TO OVERTURN THE RELEVANT ARTICLES.  THE </p><p>NATION\'S ATTENTION WILL NOW TURN TO THE SUPREME COURT, WHICH WE </p><p>ANTICIPATE WILL NOT HEAR THE CASE FOR AT LEAST SEVERAL MONTHS. </p><p> </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
