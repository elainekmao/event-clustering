<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 001839 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>OFFICIAL INFORMAL </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR SA/INS FROM AMBASSADOR WILLS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  10-03-12 </p><p>TAGS: AMGT, CE, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  OFFICIAL INFORMAL NUMBER 137 -0302) </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY DCM LEWIS AMSELEM.  REASONS 1.5, B,D. </p><p> </p><p>CONTENTS: TREASURY/AID ASSESSMENT READOUT </p><p>OTHER ASSESSMENTS </p><p>          DEMINING IN LTTE AREAS </p><p>          CAMBODIA\'S COLOMBO PLAN DUES </p><p> </p><p>TREASURY/AID ASSESSMENT READOUT </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>1.  (U)  The joint Treasury/AID team had a tremendously </p><p>successful one-week visit here last month.  It was packed </p><p>with meetings from early morning into each evening.  Even </p><p>though it was an office director (and below) level team, </p><p>we had no problems getting meetings with numerous </p><p>Ministers (Finance, Economic Reform, Labor and the </p><p>Central Bank Governor), who were eager to discuss U.S. </p><p>aid and technical assistance.  We in the mission, for our </p><p>part, are very happy with how the mission went and its </p><p>outcomes thus far. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) The main outcome of the Treasury portion of the </p><p>mission will be the placement of several (at least two, </p><p>maybe more) Treasury Advisors in GSL beginning probably </p><p>early 2003.  One would work on improving debt management </p><p>and one on improving budgeting; one may also assist with </p><p>the reorganization of state-run People\'s Bank (in big </p><p>trouble because of bad loans).  GSL was extremely </p><p>enthusiastic about having long-term Treasury Advisors </p><p>working with it to improve its performance on some of the </p><p>areas key to economic reform.  A follow-up mission from </p><p>Treasury to scope-out the particular projects is due here </p><p>week of October 14. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) While Treasury was here to identify specific </p><p>technical assistance projects, the AID portion of the </p><p>mission had a more general objective of determining what </p><p>areas the AID program should focus on in the future. </p><p>Based on the debrief the AID visitors gave the DCM at the </p><p>end of its visit, AID is looking to focus on two themes </p><p>here: facilitating economic growth island-wide and </p><p>economic-integration of the North/East with the rest of </p><p>the country.  Some specific areas mentioned were: making </p><p>industry and labor more productive; further developing </p><p>the financial sector; improving agricultural </p><p>productivity; helping GSL rationalize government (e.g. </p><p>customs reform); helping GSL communicate its reforms </p><p>better to the people; and promoting further </p><p>decentralization of government functions.  The visitors </p><p>also mentioned that AID would be willing to look at </p><p>helping Sri Lanka prepare for FTA negotiations with the </p><p>U.S., should that become a near-term possibility. </p><p> </p><p>OTHER ASSESSMENTS </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  As you know, the Peace Corps hasn\'t properly assessed </p><p>us yet.  That will happen soon.  The PACOM team is in </p><p>country now.  And the NDU team\'s report just reached us </p><p>by email yesterday (10/2) and has been forwarded to INS </p><p>and the SA FO, also via email.  (FO) </p><p> </p><p>DEMINING IN LTTE AREAS </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>5.  (C) In reply to your o/i query, we do not think the </p><p>U.S. should be involved directly (repeat directly) in any </p><p>demining projects that take place in LTTE-controlled </p><p>areas.  As you know, the LTTE is on the FTO and we do not </p><p>think USG officials should be involved in interactions </p><p>with the group.  For the same reason, we do not think the </p><p>U.S. should be involved in directly funding any local </p><p>NGOs controlled by the LTTE that are doing demining. </p><p>That said, we could see funding international NGOs that </p><p>may want to do demining in LTTE-controlled areas, such as </p><p>HALO Trust.  We already have a precedent to rely on:  we </p><p>provide funds to CARE which does work in LTTE areas.  In </p><p>general, however, we think there is more than enough </p><p>demining to be done in GSL-controlled areas, including </p><p>projects that directly benefit Tamils and Muslims.  The </p><p>QRDF\'s project in Jaffna, for example, mainly benefits </p><p>Tamils living in what is a GSL-controlled area. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) By the way, we are faxing you an exchange of </p><p>letters between the Ambassador and Donald McCoy.  McCoy, </p><p>writing on behalf of the Marshall Legacy Institute (MLI), </p><p>requests U.S. support for a demining project using dogs </p><p>that it would like to implement in Sri Lanka.  It sounded </p><p>like an excellent idea to us and we know that MLI has </p><p>done good work elsewhere.  Perry Baltimore, MLI\'s </p><p>president, is set to visit Sri Lanka in November and we </p><p>will meet with him.  He may call SA/INS and Pat Patierno </p><p>in PM/HDP for a briefing before he departs the U.S. (POL) </p><p> </p><p>CAMBODIA\'S COLOMBO PLAN DUES </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>7.  (U) During the most recent Colombo Plan meeting, </p><p>Cambodia\'s request to be exempt from the USD 14,500 </p><p>annual dues was raised again.  A motion was passed to </p><p>postpone making a decision on the matter until the April </p><p>14-16, 2003, Consultative Committee Meeting in Tehran. </p><p>As the issue comes up, we\'ll continue to insist that the </p><p>Khmers pay up, per the previous guidance we received from </p><p>the Department.  By the way, has anyone had a chance to </p><p>review our action request re participation in the Tehran </p><p>meeting, which was sent way back in July (Colombo 1412)? </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
