(01) HCMC 1134 B. (01) HCMC 1079 </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) SUMMARY: AN ETHNIC MINORITY LEADER FROM GIA </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HO CHI  00131  01 OF 02  080617Z </p><p>LAI PROVINCE RECENTLY DESCRIBED TO POLOFF A COMPLEX WEB </p><p>OF SHIFTING LOCAL ALLIANCES AMONG THE ETHNIC GROUPS IN </p><p>VIETNAM\'S CENTRAL HIGHLANDS.  MIXING RELIGION WITH </p><p>POLITICS, IT INCLUDES STRONG CONNECTIONS TO ETHNIC </p><p>MINORITY EXILES IN THE U.S.  ANOTHER ETHNIC MINORITY </p><p>LEADER FROM DAK LAK PROVINCE SAID THAT DIFFERENCES OF </p><p>OPINION CONCERNING MINORITY PERSONS FROM THE CENTRAL </p><p>HIGHLANDS SEEKING REFUGE IN CAMBODIA HAS MADE THE SPLIT </p><p>BETWEEN THE "DEGA PROTESTANTS" AND MAINSTREAM </p><p>PROTESTANTS IN THE AREA MORE RANCOROUS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) THE ETHNIC MINORITY LEADER FROM GIA LAI </p><p>PROVINCE ESTIMATED 30 PERCENT OF ETHNIC MINORITY PEOPLE </p><p>("MONTAGNARDS") IN GIA LAI PROVINCE SUPPORT THE NOTION </p><p>OF AN AUTONOMOUS "DEGA (ETHNIC MINORITY) STATE" IN THE </p><p>CENTRAL HIGHLANDS.  AMONG THIS 30 PERCENT, HOWEVER, </p><p>THERE ARE SERIOUS DIVISIONS. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) WHAT THE ETHNIC MINORITY LEADER TERMED "THE </p><p>POLITICAL GROUP" IS LARGELY SUPPORTIVE OF KOK K\'SOR, </p><p>CURRENTLY RESIDING IN SOUTH CAROLINA.  KOK K\'SOR </p><p>PROCLAIMED HIMSELF PRESIDENT-IN-EXILE OF AN INDEPENDENT </p><p>DEGA STATE IN SEPTEMBER 2000.  WHAT THE ETHNIC MINORITY </p><p>LEADER TERMED "THE RELIGIOUS GROUP" SUPPORTS K\'SOR, </p><p>INSOFAR AS HE PROMOTES PROTESTANTISM AS THE DEGA STATE </p><p>RELIGION.  A THIRD GROUP, WHICH HE SAID IS NEITHER </p><p>POLITICAL NOR RELIGIOUS, IS COMPOSED OF "OPPORTUNISTS" </p><p>WHO USE PROMISES OF DEGA AUTONOMY OR INDEPENDENCE TO </p><p>BUILD THEIR PERSONAL FIEFDOMS.  THIS THIRD GROUP WOULD </p><p>BE UNIMPORTANT, ACCORDING TO THE ETHNIC MINORITY </p><p>LEADER, EXCEPT THAT THEY PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HO CHI  00131  01 OF 02  080617Z </p><p>PERSUADING PEOPLE TO DEPART VIETNAM FOR UNHCR CAMPS IN </p><p>CAMBODIA -- OFTEN PROMISING RESETTLEMENT TO THE U.S. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) THE ETHNIC MINORITY LEADER CONFIRMED THAT THE </p><p>TOP ORGANIZER OF THE "POLITICAL GROUP" WAS A PERSON </p><p>NAMED JANA YBONR (ALSO KNOWN AS BOME) WHO WAS CONVICTED </p><p>OF DESTABILIZING PUBLIC SECURITY AND SENTENCED TO 12 </p><p>YEARS\' IMPRISONMENT IN SEPTEMBER (SEE REFTELS).  HE </p><p>SAID SEVEN PERSONS STILL FORM THE CORE LEADERSHIP OF </p><p>THE POLITICAL GROUP, AND THAT ALL SEVEN  STILL RESIDE </p><p>IN VIETNAM.  THE CURRENT HEAD OF THE GROUP IS A WOMAN </p><p>NAMED H\'JIP (ALSO KNOWN AS AMI SARA).  HE SAID SHE </p><p>RESIDES IN PHU NHUON DISTRICT OF GIA LAI PROVINCE, BUT </p><p>RECENTLY WENT INTO HIDING IN DAK LAK PROVINCE AND IS A </p><p>FUGITIVE FROM VIETNAMESE POLICE.  (NOTE: THE ETHNIC </p><p>MINORITY LEADER EXPLAINED THAT AMONG THE EDE AND GIA </p><p>RAI MINORITY GROUPS, ADULTS USUALLY CARRY AT LEAST TWO </p><p>NAMES - THEIR BIRTH-NAME AND THE NAME THEY ACQUIRE UPON </p><p>THE BIRTH OF THEIR FIRST CHILD.  FOR EXAMPLE, AMI SARA </p><p>MEANS "MOTHER OF SARA," AND AMA CHAM MEANS "FATHER OF </p><p>CHAM."  END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) THE HEAD OF THE "RELIGIOUS GROUP," ACCORDING </p><p>TO THE ETHNIC MINORITY LEADER, IS AMA CHAM, WHO </p><p>CURRENTLY RESIDES AT ONE OF THE UNHCR CAMPS IN </p><p>CAMBODIA.  THE MINORITY LEADER SAID THAT MOST OF THE </p><p>ORGANIZERS OF THE RELIGIOUS GROUP HAVE GONE TO </p><p>CAMBODIA.  HE SAID THIS GROUP OF "DEGA PROTESTANTS" </p><p>SPLIT FROM THE MAINSTREAM PROTESTANTS IN THE CENTRAL </p><p>HIGHLANDS (WHO MOSTLY FOLLOW MISSIONARIES AND PASTORS </p><p>OF THE CHRISTIAN AND MISSIONARY ALLIANCE OR CMA) TO </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HO CHI  00131  01 OF 02  080617Z </p><p>SUPPORT AN INDEPENDENT DEGA STATE LED BY KOK K\'SOR. </p><p>RECENTLY, HOWEVER, THE POLITICAL AND RELIGIOUS GROUPS </p><p>"ARGUE AND FIGHT AMONG THEMSELVES."  THE DEGA </p><p>PROTESTANTS INSIST THAT PROTESTANTISM MUST BE THE STATE </p><p>RELIGION, AND ALL CITIZENS OF A DEGA STATE MUST BE </p><p>PROTESTANT, ACCORDING TO THIS ETHNIC MINORITY LEADER. </p><p>MEANWHILE, THE POLITICAL GROUP WANTS AND NEEDS A </p><p>BROADER BASE OF SUPPORT. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) THE ETHNIC MINORITY LEADER SAID THAT SIMILAR </p><p>DIVISIONS EXIST WITHIN THE MONTAGNARD COMMUNITY IN THE </p><p>UNITED STATES.  THERE ARE THOSE WHO SUPPORT AN </p><p>INDEPENDENT DEGA STATE, AND THERE ARE THOSE WHO DESIRE </p><p>ONLY TO ADVOCATE FOR BETTER TREATMENT OF ETHNIC </p><p>MINORITIES IN VIETNAM.  AMONG THOSE WHO SUPPORT AN </p><p>INDEPENDENT STATE ARE BOTH THOSE WHO ACCEPT KOK K\'SOR </p><p>AS HEAD OF A GOVERNMENT-IN-EXILE AND THOSE WHO REJECT </p><p>HIM.  AMONG K\'SOR SUPPORTERS ARE THOSE WHO SEEK BROAD- </p><p>BASED SUPPORT AND THOSE WHO SEEK PARTICIPATION LIMITED </p><p>ONLY TO BAPTIZED PROTESTANTS.  (NOTE: THE LEADER SAID </p><p>HE IS AWARE OF THESE DIVISIONS WITHIN THE U.S.-BASED </p><p>COMMUNITY THROUGH FREQUENT PHONE CONVERSATIONS WITH </p><p>RELATIVES IN THE U.S.  END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) ANOTHER ETHNIC MINORITY LEADER FROM DAK LAK </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HO CHI  00131  02 OF 02  080617Z </p><p>PROVINCE TOLD POLOFF THAT SINCE THE GVN RECOGNIZED THE </p><p>SOUTHERN EVANGELICAL CHURCH OF VIETNAM IN APRIL 2001, </p><p>PROVINCIAL AUTHORITIES HAVE SOUGHT OUT MAINSTREAM </p><p>PROTESTANT PASTORS TO HELP MAINTAIN ORDER WITHIN THE </p><p>ETHNIC MINORITY COMMUNITIES.  THIS ETHNIC MINORITY </p><p>LEADER, WHO IS HIMSELF AN ORDAINED PROTESTANT PASTOR, </p><p>SAID THAT MAINSTREAM PASTORS ARE WILLING TO COOPERATE </p><p>WITH THE GOVERNMENT.  THEY TELL THEIR CONGREGATIONS NOT </p><p>TO RUN TO CAMBODIA.  IN CONTRAST, DEGA PASTORS EXHORT </p><p>THEIR FOLLOWERS TO CROSS THE BORDER TO UNHCR CAMPS. </p><p>THE SPLIT BETWEEN DEGA PROTESTANTS AND MAINSTREAM </p><p>PROTESTANTS HAS BECOME MORE ACRIMONIOUS OVER THIS </p><p>ISSUE, HE ASSERTED. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) COMMENT: ANY MOVES TOWARD AN INDEPENDENT DEGA </p><p>STATE IN VIETNAM\'S CENTRAL HIGHLANDS WOULD BE STRONGLY </p><p>RESISTED BY THE GVN.  IN NUMEROUS PUBLIC STATEMENTS AND </p><p>PRIVATE CONVERSATIONS, VIETNAMESE OFFICIALS STRESS THE </p><p>IMPORTANCE OF STABILITY AND UNITY.  THE SEVERAL </p><p>MINORITY LEADERS WE HAVE SPOKEN TO ALL WANT BETTER </p><p>TREATMENT FOR ETHNIC MINORITIES IN VIETNAM.  BUT WHEN </p><p>RELIGION MIXES WITH "SEPARATIST" POLITICAL GOALS, THE </p><p>GVN SEES ONLY THE PROBLEM OF ENSURING STABILITY AND </p><p>POLITICAL UNITY -- NOT A QUESTION OF RELIGIOUS BELIEF. </p><p>YAMAUCHI </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
