REASONS: 1.5 </p><p>B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) THE CANDIDATE FOR THE OPPOSITION MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC </p><p>CHANGE (MDC) OVERCAME A CONCERTED CAMPAIGN EFFORT BY THE RULING </p><p>ZANU-PF, INCLUDING SIGNIFICANT LEVELS OF VIOLENCE AND </p><p>INTIMIDATION (REFTELS), TO WIN THE MASVINGO MAYORAL ELECTION MAY </p><p>12-13.   THE MDC\'S ALOIS CHAIMITI, A RETIRED ENGINEER, RECEIVED </p><p>4,532 VOTES, WHILE 2,188 VOTES WENT TO JACOB CHADEMANA OF ZANU- </p><p>PF.  THE THREE INDEPENDENT CANDIDATES WERE ONLY A MINOR FACTOR, </p><p>POLLING 664 VOTES AMONG THEM.   ONLY SOME 7,000 PEOPLE OUT OF </p><p>27,000 REGISTERED VOTERS CAST THEIR BALLOTS, WHILE MORE THAN </p><p>3,000 VOTERS WHOSE NAMES DID NOT APPEAR ON THE VOTERS ROLL WERE </p><p>TURNED AWAY.  CHAIMITI, ZIMBABWE\'S FIRST MDC MAYOR, PLEDGED TO </p><p>WORK COOPERATIVELY WITH THE NINE ZANU-PF REPRESENTATIVES AND ONE </p><p>INDEPENDENT ON THE CITY COUNCIL FOR THE BETTERMENT OF MASVINGO. </p><p> </p><p>MDC\'S REACTION </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) THE MDC LEADERSHIP WAS UNDERSTANDABLY ELATED AT THE </p><p>OUTCOME.  PARTY PRESIDENT MORGAN TSVANGIRAI TOLD JOURNALISTS THE </p><p>PEOPLE OF MASVINGO HAD SENT A CLEAR MESSAGE THAT "THOSE PARTIES </p><p>THAT RELY ON VIOLENCE IN THEIR QUEST FOR PUBLIC OFFICE ...HAVE NO </p><p>PLACE IN THE NEW DEMOCRATIC DISPENSATION...NEVER AGAIN SHOULD THE </p><p>PEOPLE OF ZIMBABWE LEGITIMIZE VIOLENCE."  THE MDC\'S NATIONAL </p><p>DIRECTOR OF ELECTIONS, PAUL THEMBA NYATHI, SAID THE RESULTS </p><p>DEMONSTRATED THAT ZIMBABWEANS WANT POLITICAL CHANGE.  "THIS </p><p>SHOWS," NYATHI INSISTED, "THAT THE PEOPLE OF ZIMBABWE ARE NOW </p><p>AWARE THAT THE POWER TO CHANGE IS IN THEIR HANDS." </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01620  151502Z </p><p> </p><p>REACTION OF GOVERNMENT AND ZANU/PF </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) SAMUEL MUMBENGEGWI, ZANU-PF CHAIRMAN FOR MASVINGO </p><p>PROVINCE AND NATIONAL MINISTER OF EDUCATION, SPORTS, AND CULTURE, </p><p>BLAMED THE LOSS ON MDC-PERPETRATED VIOLENCE, WHICH HE SAID HAD </p><p>SCARED THE RULING PARTY\'S SUPPORTERS AWAY FROM THE POLLS, AND ON </p><p>THE ALLEGEDLY POOR STATE OF THE VOTERS ROLL.  THE GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>CHIEF PROPAGANDIST -- INFORMATION AND PUBLICITY MINISTER JONATHAN </p><p>MOYO -- DISMISSED THE MDC VICTORY, SAYING WHAT REALLY MATTERED </p><p>WAS THAT THE CITY COUNCIL REMAINED IN ZANU-PF\'S HANDS. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) WE WERE NOT SURPRISED AT THE LARGE PERCENTAGE OF VOTERS </p><p>WHO STAYED AWAY FROM THE POLLS, GIVEN THE TENSE POLITICAL </p><p>ATMOSPHERE WHICH PRECEDED THE ELECTION.  IN CONTRAST TO THE </p><p>HISTORICAL PATTERN, HOWEVER, ZANU-PF DID NOT BENEFIT THIS TIME </p><p>FROM THE LOW VOTER TURNOUT.  THE FACT THAT THE MDC RECEIVED 8,000 </p><p>FEWER VOTES IN MASVINGO THAN IT DID IN THE JUNE 2000 </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION, WHILE ZANU-PF\'S TALLY DECREASED BY FEWER </p><p>THAN 1,000 VOTES, IS LIKELY NOT A REFLECTION OF ERODING SUPPORT </p><p>FOR THE OPPOSITION PARTY.  RATHER, MANY MASVINGO RESIDENTS -- THE </p><p>MAJORITY OF WHOM WERE CLEARLY MDC SUPPORTERS -- TOLD A VISITING </p><p>EMBASSY OFFICER THAT IT WAS NOT WORTH RISKING POSSIBLE </p><p>RETALIATION TO VOTE IN THE MAYORAL RACE.  INSTEAD, THEY WERE </p><p>BIDING THEIR TIME UNTIL THE 2002 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, WHEN THEY </p><p>PLANNED TO CAST THEIR BALLOTS FOR THE PRIZE WHICH REALLY </p><p>MATTERED.  IN THE SHORT TERM, THE MASVINGO OUTCOME WILL BOOST THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  01620  151502Z </p><p>MORALE OF MDC SUPPORTERS NATIONWIDE, WHO WILL SEE THAT VICTORY IS </p><p>POSSIBLE EVEN IN THE FACE OF INTENSIVE INTIMIDATION, AND </p><p>INDICATES THAT THE MDC MIGHT HAVE THE UPPER HAND FOR NOW IN THE </p><p>PROVINCE THAT BOTH MAJOR PARTIES CONSIDER CRUCIAL TO THEIR </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL RACE PROSPECTS. </p><p> </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
