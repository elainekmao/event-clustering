<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ADANA 0099 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINS, PGOV, PHUM, TU, IZ, ADANA, Press Summaries </p><p>SUBJECT:  SOUTHEAST TURKEY PRESS SUMMARY, </p><p>          APRIL 08, 2003 </p><p> </p><p>1.  This is the Southeastern Turkey press summary </p><p>for April 08, 2003.  Please note that Turkish </p><p>press reports often contain errors or </p><p>exaggerations; AmConsulate Adana does not vouch </p><p>for the accuracy of the reports summarized here. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>POLITICICAL, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  Milliyet: Osman Ocalan, the brother of PKK </p><p>leader Abullah Ocalan, announced to Reuters that </p><p>the war on Iraq created a new opportunity for the </p><p>PKK, which now seeks to benefit from </p><p>disagreements between Washington and Ankara. </p><p>Osman Ocalan was interviewed by a Reuters\' </p><p>reporter in PKK/KADEK camp at Kandil Mountain in </p><p>northern Iraq.  He claimed the disagreement that </p><p>resulted by Ankara\'s refusal of the motion gave </p><p>them an opportunity to push their issues forward, </p><p>and assessed that it would be possible for the </p><p>PKK to establish ties with the US.  He expressed </p><p>his wish to form an alliance with Washington. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  Cumhuriyet/Evrensel/Tercuman/Milli Gazete: It </p><p>is reported that some of the 12 Patriot missiles </p><p>unloaded at Iskenderun port and forwarded on to </p><p>Incirlik AFB will be deployed at the Turkish </p><p>border, while others will be deployed in northern </p><p>Iraq. Meanwhile, 42 trucks that left the base in </p><p>Kiziltepe (Mardin) also arrived in Iskenderun. </p><p>"Explosive Material" and "Ammunition" signs were </p><p>seen on some of the containers.  Following the </p><p>conclusion of the movement from the bases in the </p><p>Mardin industrial zone, the rented facilities </p><p>will be turned over to the owners again. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  Sabah: Iskenderun will become the center for </p><p>transportation of food items to be exported to </p><p>Iraq under the oil-for-food program administered </p><p>by the United Nations. An independent company, </p><p>Cotegna, which has been selected by the UN, will </p><p>start working in Iskenderun to coordinate the </p><p>deliveries. Turkish firms interested in exporting </p><p>to Iraq will also apply to the office in </p><p>Iskenderun. It is reported that about 250 trucks </p><p>will carry foodstuffs from Iskenderun to Iraq on </p><p>a daily basis. Because the Habur border gate to </p><p>northern Iraq is sealed, the foodstuffs are being </p><p>kept in warehouses rented in Gaziantep for the </p><p>time being. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  Radikal: The UN expedited its shipment of </p><p>food items to civilians in northern Iraq under </p><p>the World Food Program. One thousand tons of </p><p>flour was shipped to Dohuk last week, and more </p><p>shipment of food items continued the previous </p><p>night and today, too. The authorities announced </p><p>that most of the shipment of 6 thousand tons of </p><p>flour had been accomplished, and the shipments </p><p>would continue as needed. The UN has dispatched </p><p>100 trucks of food items to northern Iraq since </p><p>last week. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  Radikal/Milli gazete: American doctors, who </p><p>evacuated their logistical support center in </p><p>Mardin, made rounds at the State Hospital in </p><p>Mardin. It is claimed that the Americans have </p><p>been doing such a study in order to evaluate the </p><p>possibility of bringing their wounded troops to </p><p>the hospital. The police visiting the hospital </p><p>afterwards determined that the US doctors had not </p><p>obtained permission from the governor\'s office to </p><p>visit the hospital. The police informed local </p><p>officials of the case. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  Turkiye/Bolge: Based on a tip, the police </p><p>arrested 11 persons on alleged membership in a </p><p>gang involved in extortion in Tarsus township of </p><p>Mersin. Three pistols of assorted make and </p><p>radius, one automatic hunting gun, and various </p><p>promissory notes were seized on the suspects, who </p><p>were ordered held by the court. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  Turkiye: Jandarmas searching some houses in </p><p>the hamlet of Dogan (Diyarbakir) seized 3 </p><p>unlicensed Kalashnikovs, 371 bullets for that </p><p>weapon, and 32 pistol bullets.  They arrested </p><p>three persons in connection with the weapons. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  Turkiye: Jandarma teams arrested a Hizbullah </p><p>member in Kabasakal hamlet near Ergani </p><p>(Diyarbakir). His name had previously been found </p><p>in a computer disc seized during an operation in </p><p>Istanbul in 2000. The interrogation of the </p><p>Hizbullah member, whose name has not been </p><p>disclosed, is continuing. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  Turkiye: 24 Afghan nationals who had </p><p>illegally passed into Turkey were arrested in </p><p>Ozalp township of Van. An investigation is </p><p>underway. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  Milliyet/Tercuman: The number of families in </p><p>Yenikoy hamlet near Siverek (Sanliurfa), dropped </p><p>from 15 to 3 due to ongoing blood feud that </p><p>stemmed from land dispute between the Gurkan and </p><p>Gurkmen families of the "Kiran" tribe five years </p><p>ago. Some 13 people have been killed in the fight </p><p>between the two families who, as a consequence of </p><p>the feud, were unable to cultivate their land or </p><p>send their children to school. While many people </p><p>have evacuated the village, the remaining </p><p>inhabitants, mostly women and children, have </p><p>built positions on the roofs of their houses and </p><p>reinforced their doors and windows to guard </p><p>against possible attacks. </p><p>HOLTZ </p><p></p></div>
