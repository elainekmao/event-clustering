(SBU)  SUMMARY:  THE EU, REPRESENTED BY THE TROIKA </p><p>AMBASSADORS, HELD A HUMAN RIGHTS DIALOGUE WITH THE GVN IN </p><p>HANOI ON DECEMBER 5 (REF A).  MORE THAN A DOZEN GVN </p><p>OFFICIALS PARTICIPATED, INCLUDING REPRESENTATIVES OF THE </p><p>MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS (MFA), MINISTRY OF PUBLIC </p><p>SECURITY (MPS), AND MINISTRY OF JUSTICE (MOJ).  TOPICS </p><p>INCLUDED THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS, PRISONERS AND DETAINEES OF </p><p>CONCERN, THE DEATH PENALTY, PRISON VISITS, AND FUTURE </p><p>DIALOGUES.  THE GVN PROVIDED AN UPDATE OF THREE PERSONS OF </p><p>CONCERN ON A EU LIST, AS WELL AS THREE OTHERS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  THE EU HAS EMBARKED ON A TWO-TIER HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>DIALOGUE WITH THE GVN.  LONG-STANDING WORKING LEVEL </p><p>DIALOGUES TAKE PLACE REGULARLY; THE LAST OCCURRED IN OCTOBER </p><p>AND THE NEXT IS TENTATIVELY SCHEDULED FOR MARCH.  ON </p><p>DECEMBER 5, THE EU TROIKA AMBASSADORS HAD THE SECOND HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS DIALOGUE AT THAT LEVEL; THE FIRST TOOK PLACE IN MAY </p><p>2002 AND WILL CONTINUE ON A SEMI-ANNUAL BASIS, CORRESPONDING </p><p>WITH CHANGES IN THE EU PRESIDENCY. AT THE LATEST MEETING, </p><p>THE TROIKA (WITH ITALY REPRESENTING GREECE) HANDLED THE </p><p>DIALOGUE BY ITSELF, WITHOUT ASSISTANCE FROM OTHER EU </p><p>MEMBERS, ACCORDING TO EU EMBASSY CONTACTS.  THE NEXT TROIKA </p><p>AMBASSADORS\' MEETING WILL BE IN MAY 2003. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  THE AMBASSADORIAL-LEVEL REPRESENTATION AT THE </p><p>DECEMBER 5 DIALOGUE GAVE IT "MORE CLOUT" THAN NORMAL, </p><p>ACCORDING TO ONE EU SOURCE (WITHOUT EXPLAINING THE EXACT </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  03028  01 OF 02  191033Z </p><p>BENEFITS IN WHAT APPEARED TO A MOSTLY LACKLUSTER EXCHANGE). </p><p>OVER A DOZEN GVN OFFICIALS ATTENDED, LED BY LE LUONG MINH, </p><p>THEN-ACTING DIRECTOR OF MFA\'S INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS </p><p>DEPARTMENT.  (NOTE:  MINH, WHO ALSO HEADED THE GVN </p><p>DELEGATION AT THE US-VIETNAM HUMAN RIGHTS DIALOGUE IN </p><p>NOVEMBER, HAS SINCE BEEN ASSIGNED AS ACTING DIRECTOR OF THE </p><p>MFA\'S MULTILATERAL ECONOMIC COOPERATION DEPARTMENT.  END </p><p>NOTE)  DEPUTY DIRECTORS OF THE EUROPE II DEPARTMENT, THE </p><p>CONSULAR DEPARTMENT, AND THE PRESS DEPARTMENT ALSO </p><p>REPRESENTED THE MFA.  AS AT THE VIETNAM/US DIALOGUE (REF B), </p><p>THE PARTICIPATION OF MINISTRIES OTHER THAN THE MFA WAS </p><p>UNPRECEDENTED FOR THE EU.  MOJ AND MPS REPRESENTATIVES ALSO </p><p>ATTENDED THE BILATERAL HUMAN RIGHTS DIALOGUE WITH AUSTRALIA </p><p>IN MAY 2002. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  ACCORDING TO AN EU EMBASSY SOURCE, IT WAS </p><p>"DIFFICULT" TO GET DISCUSSIONS GOING DURING THE THREE-HOUR </p><p>MEETING, AS THE GVN FREQUENTLY ANSWERED EU QUESTIONS "WITH </p><p>RHETORIC."  HOWEVER, EU REPRESENTATIVES CLAIMED TO HAVE </p><p>FOUND "CONVINCING" THE ANSWER OF THE MFA PRESS DEPARTMENT\'S </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE ABOUT REPORTS THAT THREE MONTAGNARDS HAD BEEN </p><p>EXECUTED RECENTLY BY LETHAL INJECTION.  THE PRESS OFFICIAL </p><p>STATED THAT NOT ONLY WERE THE REPORTS OF DEATH UNTRUE, BUT </p><p>THAT ONLY ONE OF THE THREE HAD EVEN BEEN IN DETENTION, AND </p><p>HAD ALREADY BEEN RELEASED. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  GVN OFFICIALS NOTED THE DIFFICULTIES IN CHECKING </p><p>LISTS OF PERSONS OF CONCERN (SUCH AS THE LIST OF ABOUT 15 </p><p>PERSONS SUBMITTED AT THE OCTOBER WORKING-LEVEL DIALOGUE) </p><p>BECAUSE SOME INDIVIDUALS WERE LISTED BY THEIR RELIGIOUS </p><p>NAMES, WHILE PRISONER RECORDS ARE BY CIVIL NAMES. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  03028  01 OF 02  191033Z </p><p>NONETHELESS, THE GVN PROVIDED THE EU TROIKA AMBASSADORS ORAL </p><p>UPDATES ABOUT THREE INDIVIDUALS ON THE OCTOBER LIST, AS WELL </p><p>AS INFORMATION ABOUT THREE INDIVIDUALS NOT ON THE EU LIST </p><p>(SEE PARA 8).  GVN OFFICIALS DID NOT EXPLAIN WHY THEY </p><p>PROVIDED INFORMATION ON THE OTHER THREE, DESPITE QUESTIONING </p><p>FROM THE EU PARTICIPANTS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  EU REPRESENTATIVES ASKED WHETHER DEATH PENALTY </p><p>STATISTICS WERE AVAILABLE.  (NOTE: THERE IS SOME FEELING </p><p>AMONG HANOI-BASED EU MEMBER COUNTRY DIPLOMATS THAT THE GVN </p><p>DOES NOT CARRY OUT ALL OF THE DEATH SENTENCES IT IMPOSES, </p><p>AND THAT THIS COULD BE SEEN AS A FAVORABLE HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>POINT.  END NOTE)  THE GVN SIDE REPLIED THAT NO SUCH </p><p>STATISTICS ARE AVAILABLE, BUT SOME OF THE GVN DELEGATES </p><p>APPEARED TO GRASP THE EU\'S POINT THAT THEY MIGHT TELL A MORE </p><p>FAVORABLE STORY, ACCORDING TO ONE EU EMBASSY SOURCE. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU)  THE EU TROIKA REQUESTED PERMISSION TO VISIT Z30A </p><p>PRISON IN DONG NAI OR B14 PRISON NEAR HANOI; BOTH REPORTEDLY </p><p>HOUSE A NUMBER OF PERSONS OF CONCERN.  GVN OFFICIALS </p><p>INDICATED WILLINGNESS TO ARRANGE A PRISON VISIT "ANY TIME," </p><p>BUT AS OF DECEMBER 18 HAD NOT YET REPLIED TO THIS EU </p><p>REQUEST.  (NOTE:  IN JUNE THE GVN TURNED DOWN A CANADIAN </p><p>EMBASSY REQUEST TO VISIT B14.
