<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 000495 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF/W </p><p>STATE PASS OPIC, TDA, AND EXIM </p><p>STATE PASS USTR AND DOT </p><p>COMMERCE FOR ITA/MAC </p><p>STATE PASS USTR </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, KCRM, EINV, BEXP, EFIN, ETRD, KPRV, ECON, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: ECONOMIC ROUNDUP MARCH 13 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA 257 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. This periodic economic report from Abuja and Lagos </p><p>includes: </p><p>--GON Bans Import of Toothpicks, Water, Biscuits, Spaghetti, </p><p>and Noodles </p><p>--Obasanjo Sacks Author of Controversial Audit Report </p><p>--Central Bank Warns of Excess Liquidity </p><p>--Nigerian Customs Posts Banner Year </p><p>--GON to Sell Steel Rolling, Palm Oil, and Brick Firms </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GON Bans Import of Toothpicks, Water, Biscuits, Spaghetti, </p><p>and Noodles </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p>2. With the elections approximately six weeks away, bad </p><p>economic policy has become a good way to garner votes. As a </p><p>consequence, protectionism seems to be governing the GON\'s </p><p>course for now. At a recent campaign stop, President Obasanjo </p><p>stated, "For a start, we are going to ban the importation of </p><p>tooth-picks, bottled water, biscuits, spaghetti and noodles </p><p>and every six months, we will meet to look at other things we </p><p>can ban to encourage local production. It is unacceptable </p><p>that we spend up to $13 million to import toothpicks and up </p><p>to $30 million to import bottled water." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. Chief Economic Advisor Magnus Kpakol confirmed the press </p><p>report, but declined to offer immediate comment. Meanwhile, </p><p>Econoff in Lagos obtained a copy of a customs circular dated </p><p>March 3 banning, with immediate effect, the import of </p><p>"toothpicks in any form, table drinking water (spring or </p><p>sparkling), all types of biscuits, and spaghetti and </p><p>noodles." Post will report further on these bans Septel, </p><p>including an assessment of their impact on U.S. exports to </p><p>Nigeria. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Obasanjo Sacks Author of Controversial Audit Report </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>4. The GON announced February 12 it would not extend Vincent </p><p>Azie\'s tenure as Acting Auditor General of the Federation. In </p><p>January, Azie had authorized the release of the 2001 Audit </p><p>Report that contained a list of allegations of billions of </p><p>naira of financial impropriety and other malfeasance in the </p><p>management of public accounts by the three arms of government </p><p>(Reftel). President Obasanjo had directed all Ministries to </p><p>explain to the National Assembly the anomalies identified in </p><p>the document. However, many Ministers publicly and privately </p><p>condemned Azie for grandstanding and seeking to embarrass </p><p>them. Apparently, the angry voices of these red-faced </p><p>officials were heard when it came time to decide on Azie\'s </p><p>extension. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. Joe Ajiboye, bypassed for the job six months ago, was </p><p>named Azie\'s replacement. Ajiboye is a Yoruba, like Obasanjo, </p><p>and the Senate refused to confirm him over concerns that </p><p>there were already too many Yoruba in senior GON financial </p><p>positions. (Note: The Central Bank Governor and Accountant </p><p>General are also Yoruba. End Note.) Minister of Finance Adamu </p><p>Ciroma claims the GON is putting Ajiboye forward again based </p><p>on the recommendation of the Civil Service Commission, which </p><p>gives Ajiboye an edge over Azie because Azie faces mandatory </p><p>retirement in October. However, Ciroma also said "What the </p><p>former Auditor-General did was gross insubordination and </p><p>incompetence," hinting that there may have been more to the </p><p>decision than retirement plans. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. Comment: Over the past two weeks, there has been some </p><p>public unhappiness over Azie\'s removal, with many newspapers </p><p>criticizing the move, saying it will deter whistle blowers </p><p>from stepping forward. Many Embassy contacts say that the </p><p>charges of incompetence are unfounded. Meanwhile, the </p><p>National Assembly has kept quiet about the report, and is </p><p>unlikely to look at it seriously until after elections, if at </p><p>all. Unless the GON produces evidence to support the </p><p>assertion of insubordination, public confidence in the </p><p>probity of public officials will not be enhanced by Azie\'s </p><p>dismissal. End Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Central Bank Warns of Excess Liquidity </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>7. The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) recently warned that </p><p>inflation might increase in 2003 because of higher government </p><p>spending. CBN Governor Joseph Sanusi said in a speech before </p><p>the Bankers\' Committee that while the naira remained </p><p>relatively stable at 126 to 128 to the dollar and the CBN </p><p>hard-curreny reserves had rebounded by the end of 2002, </p><p>excess liquidity would be a problem in 2003. He predicted </p><p>that, based on past election-year experience and the </p><p>government\'s current fiscal policy, the CBN would find it </p><p>difficult to manage liquidity and maintain macroeconomic </p><p>stability in 2003. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. Sanusi also noted that in 2002, private sector lending </p><p>rose by 22.6 percent, compared to 43.5 percent the previous </p><p>year. The smaller increase in lending, he said, contributed </p><p>to the slowdown in economic growth for 2002. The CBN reported </p><p>real GDP growth of 3.3 percent for the year, compared to 3.9 </p><p>for 2001. At the same time, the CBN reported that inflation </p><p>moderated to approximately 13.2 percent for 2002, down from </p><p>18.9 the previous year. (Note: The IMF reported there was a </p><p>real GDP contraction of 0.9 percent over 2002. The IMF figure </p><p>seems more realistic. End Note.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Nigerian Customs Posts Banner Year </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>9. The Nigerian Customs Service (NCS) posted record revenues </p><p>for 2002, according to Customs Comptroller-General Alhaji </p><p>A.A. Mustapha. NCS collected N184.39 billion for the year, </p><p>slightly surpassing the target of N180 billion. Mustapha </p><p>credits the surplus to enforcement of the 100 percent </p><p>examination regime and greater and more effective </p><p>anti-smuggling efforts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. Comment: In addition to mandatory examinations and </p><p>contraband raids, Customs\' revenue collection benefited from </p><p>protectionist GON trade policies enacted over the last year. </p><p>High tariffs, value added taxes, and additional levies on </p><p>certain imports such as sugar all add to the government </p><p>coffers, at the expense of importers and consumers. Arguments </p><p>in favor free trade and AGOA benefits are easily drowned out </p><p>by some GON officials and economic advisors who view higher </p><p>duties and import surcharges as a good source of federal </p><p>revenue and beneficial to local industry. End Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GON to Sell Steel Rolling, Palm Oil, and Brick Firms </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>11. The Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE) informed Post </p><p>February 19, 2003, that it is seeking core investors to </p><p>submit expressions of interest to buy (1) 51 percent shares </p><p>in three steel rolling mills, (2) 70 percent shares in two </p><p>palm oil processing mills, and (3) 100 percent shares in </p><p>seven brick manufacturing firms.
