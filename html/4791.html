<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 007349 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/PPD (MCGUINNESS, CBOURGEOIS), R, NEA/ARN, </p><p>NEA/P (ACASPER) </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, PREL, KISL, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: MEPI REACTION: AMMAN </p><p> </p><p>1.  SUMMARY:  THE MEPI AND SECRETARY POWELL\'S SPEECH HAVE </p><p>DOMINATED JORDANIAN EDITORIAL PAGES IN RECENT DAYS, WITH </p><p>REACTION BEST DESCRIBED AS COMPLEX:  SOME WRITERS HAVE </p><p>WELCOMED THE INITIATIVE, EXPRESSING A KIND OF RELIEF AT THE </p><p>ACCURATE IDENTIFICATION OF CORE DEFICIENCIES PLAGUING ARAB </p><p>SOCIETIES (IF MIXED WITH AN ADMITTED DEGREE OF "SHAME" THAT </p><p>IT WAS THE U.S. THAT DID SO AND SUSPICION OF TRUE U.S. </p><p>MOTIVES), WHILE OTHERS HAVE REJECTED THE INITIATIVE AS AN </p><p>APPARENT U.S. PALLIATIVE MEANT TO DISTRACT ARABS FROM THE </p><p>REAL DANGERS IN THEIR MIDST: UNLIMITED US SUPPORT FOR ISRAEL </p><p>AND THREATS AGAINST IRAQ.  OTHER COMMENTATORS HAVE MADE THE </p><p>POINT THAT THE INITIATIVE TEMPTS GREAT DANGER:  THAT BY </p><p>ENCOURAGING GREATER DEMOCRACY IN THE REGION AT A TIME WHEN </p><p>ISLAMIST MOVEMENTS ARE VIEWED AS THE BEST ORGANIZED </p><p>POLITICAL ELEMENTS IN MANY ARAB SOCIETIES (AND FEEDING OFF </p><p>WIDESPREAD OPPOSITION TO US POLICIES TO FURTHER ENHANCE </p><p>THEIR POPULAR APPEAL), THE RESULT CAN ONLY BE FURTHER </p><p>RADICALIZATION AND INSTABILITY HERE.  PRIVATELY, SOME IN THE </p><p>BUSINESS COMMUNITY HAVE EXPRESSED DISAPPOINTMENT THAT </p><p>SPECIAL MENTION OF JORDAN\'S ONGOING ECONOMIC REFORM EFFORTS </p><p>WERE NOT HIGHLIGHTED MORE IN THE SECRETARY\'S SPEECH. </p><p>OVERALL, THE ANNOUNCEMENT HAS ALREADY HAD THE POSITIVE </p><p>EFFECT OF STIMULATING AN IMPORTANT DEBATE ON DEMOCRATIZATION </p><p>AND REFORM, AS WITNESSED FIRST-HAND WHEN PAO AND USAID </p><p>MISSION DIRECTOR PRE-BRIEFED INFLUENTIAL JORDANIAN </p><p>COLUMNISTS PRIOR TO THE SPEECH.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SECRETARY POWELL\'S MEPI SPEECH RECEIVED FRONT-PAGE </p><p>COVERAGE IN ALL JORDANIAN DAILIES ON FRIDAY, 12/13, AND HAS </p><p>BEEN THE DOMINANT ISSUE IN THE EDITORIAL PAGES SINCE.  POST </p><p>IS REPORTING SEPARATELY, IN STANDARD "MEDIA REACTION" </p><p>FORMAT, SYNOPSES OF INDIVIDUAL OP-ED COLUMNS REGARDING THE </p><p>MEPI ANNOUNCEMENT; THIS CABLE ATTEMPTS TO CRYSTALLIZE SOME </p><p>OF THE PRINCIPAL COMMENTARY WE HAVE SEEN IN JORDAN ON THE </p><p>ISSUE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  PA AMMAN ROLLED OUT THE MEPI LOCALLY WITH A PRE-BRIEFING </p><p>FOR INFLUENTIAL JORDANIAN COLUMNISTS, CONDUCTED DECEMBER 12 </p><p>BY THE PAO AND USAID MISSION DIRECTOR.  THIS SESSION </p><p>REVEALED THE MIXED VIEWS BORNE OUT IN SUBSEQUENT PUBLISHED </p><p>COMMENTARY ON THE SPEECH.  IN GENERAL, THE COLUMNISTS WE </p><p>BRIEFED WERE SUPPORTIVE OF US EFFORTS TO ENCOURAGE </p><p>POLITICAL, ECONOMIC AND EDUCATIONAL REFORM IN THE REGION, </p><p>BUT EXPRESSED SKEPTICISM ABOUT HOW SUCH EFFORTS WOULD BE </p><p>VIEWED GIVEN WIDESPREAD DISAGREEMENT WITH US POLICY TOWARD </p><p>THE ARAB-ISRAELI CONFLICT AND IRAQ.  THE US POSITION ON THE </p><p>ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN DISPUTE WAS THE "MAGIC KEY" TO GAINING </p><p>ACCEPTANCE FOR OTHER US INITIATIVES IN THE REGION, ONE </p><p>COLUMNIST SAID -- A FAILURE TO MAKE CHANGES ON THAT ISSUE </p><p>WOULD MAKE INSIGNIFICANT THE IMPACT OF THE MEPI ON BROADER </p><p>US EFFORTS TO IMPROVE ITS IMAGE IN THE REGION.  THIS </p><p>AUDIENCE ALSO FOCUSED ON THE PURPORTED PARADOX WHEREBY THE </p><p>US WOULD ENCOURAGE INCREASED POLITICAL PARTICIPATION IN </p><p>COUNTRIES WHERE IT MAINTAINS FRIENDLY RELATIONS WITH </p><p>GOVERNMENTS PERCEIVED AS HOSTILE TO INCREASED POLITICAL </p><p>OPENNESS. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>FEARS OF SUCCESS:  GAINS BY ISLAMISTS </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE MEPI MIGHT LEAD TO FURTHER </p><p>POLITICAL GAINS BY ISLAMISTS TOUCHED OFF A LIVELY DISCUSSION </p><p>IN OUR MEETING WITH COLUMNISTS.  AS THE BEST ORGANIZED AND </p><p>MOST RESPECTED (AMONG THE MASSES) POLITICAL MOVEMENTS AT </p><p>PRESENT, ISLAMIST PARTIES WOULD BE THE PRINCIPAL </p><p>BENEFICIARIES OF REAL STEPS TOWARD DEMOCRACY, SEVERAL OF </p><p>THEM ARGUED.  IN ADDITION, "UNBALANCED" US POLICIES TOWARDS </p><p>THE PALESTINIANS AND IRAQ ARE ONLY FUELING THIS TENDENCY AND </p><p>BOOSTING THE CHANCES OF ISLAMIST TAKE-OVERS.  "WAS AMERICA </p><p>AWARE OF THIS DANGER BEFORE IT DECIDED TO LAUNCH THE </p><p>INITIATIVE?", ONE OF OUR GUESTS ASKED.  ANOTHER, A SELF- </p><p>DESCRIBED "LIBERAL", SAID THAT THE REGION WAS IN DESPARATE </p><p>NEED OF MORE DEMOCRACY, BUT HE FEARED THAT AMERICA\'S NATURAL </p><p>ALLIES IN THIS EFFORT (E.G., OTHER LIBERALS) WOULD SHY AWAY </p><p>FROM EMBRACING THE INITIATIVE OUT OF DEEP-SEEDED </p><p>DISAPPOINTMENT WITH OTHER U.S. POLICIES IN THE REGION AND </p><p>SUSPICIONS ABOUT TRUE U.S. MOTIVES.  THIS SAME WRITER SAID </p><p>IN A COLUMN 12/14 IN THE ARABIC DAILY AL ARAB AL YAMM:  "WE </p><p>WELCOME THIS POSITIVE AND CONSTRUCTIVE POSITION BECAUSE WE </p><p>VALUE DEMOCRACY AND YEARN TO BE ABLE TO ENJOY IT.  WE </p><p>CHALLENGE THE AMERICAN ADMINISTRATION TO IMPLEMENT THIS </p><p>INITIATIVE AS A PACKAGE, AND WE SHALL ASSUME THAT POWELL\'S </p><p>WORDS SPRING FROM REAL CONVICTION.  BUT WE MUST REPEAT TO </p><p>THE U.S. ADMINISTRATION FOR THE THOUSANDTH TIME THAT THE KEY </p><p>TO GAINING THE CONFIDENCE OF THE ARAB PEOPLES IS THROUGH </p><p>SOLVING THE PALESTINAIN PROBLEM." </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>REJECTIONISTS AND THE OPPOSITE VIEW </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  THE INITIATIVE HAS ALSO MET WITH OUTRIGHT REJECTION BY </p><p>CERTAIN QUARTERS.  IN OUR BRIEFING OF COLUMNISTS, ONE WRITER </p><p>SAID THAT "ANY NEW US ASSISTANCE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS </p><p>INITIATIVE WILL AMOUNT TO NOTHING NEXT TO THE DESTRUCTION </p><p>YOU WILL SOON UNLEASH ON IRAQ."  THIS SAME WRITER CLAIMED AN </p><p>INCONSISTENCY IN THE INITIATIVE\'S CALL FOR GREATER POLITICAL </p><p>PARTICIPATION, "WHILE THE US WORKS TO DRAW UP ITS OWN TERMS </p><p>FOR SUCCESS" IN THE UPCOMING PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY </p><p>ELECTIONS.  FOR ITS PART, THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD-AFFILIATED </p><p>JORDANIAN "ISLAMIC ACTION FRONT" (IAF) ISSUED A STATEMENT </p><p>DECEMBER 16 THAT READ, IN PART:  "REAL PARTNERSHIP WILL </p><p>EMERGE ONLY WHEN ALL U.S. FORCES LEAVE OUR COUNTRIES AND </p><p>WHEN THE UNITED STATES STOPS THREATENING US AND INCITING </p><p>AGAINST US AND WHEN IT STOPS SUPPORTING OUR ENEMIES AND </p><p>PROVIDING THEM WITH PROTECTION.  WE WANT DEMOCRACY AS A </p><p>NATIONAL CHOICE, NOT AS A U.S. RECIPE." </p><p> </p><p>7.  ON THE OTHER HAND, WE HAVE HEARD PRIVATELY FROM BUSINESS </p><p>AND EVEN SOME GOVERNMENT CONTACTS SOME DISAPPOINTMENT THAT </p><p>JORDAN\'S OWN ECONOMIC REFORM EFFORTS WERE NOT HIGHLIGHTED </p><p>MORE SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE SECRETARY\'S SPEECH AS AN EXAMPLE </p><p>OF THE KIND OF DIFFICULT, BUT ULTIMATELY REWARDING, STEPS </p><p>REQUIRED TO BREAK LOOSE THE ECONOMIES OF THE REGION.  A DAY </p><p>PRIOR TO THE SPEECH, KING ABDULLAH OFFERED STRONG PRAISE FOR </p><p>MEPI IN REMARKS ADDRESSED VIA DIGITAL VIDEO CONFERENCE TO </p><p>BUSINESS PEOPLE AND INVESTORS IN JORDAN, WASHINGTON AND FIVE </p><p>ARAB CAPITALS  IN AN EVENT RELATED TO THE ONE-YEAR </p><p>ANNIVERSARY OF THE U.S.- JORDAN FREE TRADE AGREEMENT.  THE </p><p>JORDANIAN BUSINESS COMMUNITY IS PROUD OF THE ECONOMIC GROWTH </p><p>JORDAN HAS MANAGED TO ACHIEVE IN THE YEAR SINCE THE ENTRY- </p><p>INTO-FORCE OF THE FTA, ESPECIALLY AS OTHER ECONOMIES IN THE </p><p>REGION HAVE CONTINUED TO SLIDE. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>AN OPENING OF THE DEBATE </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>8.  AMONG THE MORE POSITIVE REACTIONS WE HAVE SEEN IS A </p><p>TREND AMONG A NUMBER OF PROGRESSIVE AND INFLUENTIAL OPINION </p><p>WRITERS (AND OTHER PA CONTACTS) WHO HAVE WELCOMED THE </p><p>OPPORTUNITY TO GET THESE ISSUES ON THE TABLE AND INTO THE </p><p>PUBLIC DEBATE.  URAIB RINTAWI, A PROMINENT DAILY COLUMNIST </p><p>WROTE IN AL-DUSTOOR 12/14:  "THE NEED FOR POLITICAL, </p><p>ECONOMIC, ADMINSITRATIVE AND FISCAL REFORM IN THE ARAB WORLD </p><p>IS REAL, EVEN IF IT IS THE AMERICANS THAT TELL US ABOUT IT. </p><p>WE SHOULD NOT SUSPEND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS WAITING FOR A </p><p>SOLUTION TO THE ARAB-ISRAELI CONFLICT."  SIMILARLY, IN A </p><p>PIECE ON 12/16 IN SEMI-OFFICIAL AL-RAI, COLUMNIST JAMAL AL- </p><p>TAHAT SAID:  "THE VALUE OF THE INITIATIVE DOES NOT LIE IN </p><p>THE FUNDS ALLOCATED TO IT, BUT IN THE IDEA ON WHICH IT IS </p><p>BASED.  BUT IT IS ALSO AN EXPRESSION OF A TOTAL ARAB </p><p>FAILURE, TO THE POINT WHERE IT SEEMS THE U.S. IS SIDING WITH </p><p>THE ARABS AGAINST THEIR OWN IGNORANCE."  AT A PA-ORGANIZED </p><p>DISCUSSION PROGRAM FOR JORDANIAN STUDENTS ON "THE ROLE OF </p><p>THINK TANKS IN FORMULATING U.S. FOREIGN POLICY" AT THE </p><p>EMBASSY ON 12/16, NUMEROUS PARTICIPANTS WERE AWARE OF THE </p><p>MEPI AND EXPRESSED INTEREST IN HOW IT MIGHT ADVANCE, FOR </p><p>INSTANCE, OPPORTUNITIES FOR WOMEN IN JORDAN.  IN SUM, U.S. </p><p>ENCOURAGEMENT OF ARAB REFORM STRUCK A LOUD CHORD IN JORDAN, </p><p>EVEN IF DISTRUST OF U.S. OBJECTIVES IN THE REGION IS ALSO AN </p><p>ISSUE IN THE DEBATE WE HAVE SPARKED. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
