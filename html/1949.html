<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 002258 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PINS, CVIS, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: RIOTS IN JOS ABATE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) ABUJA 2255 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED - PROTECT ACCORDINGLY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) SUMMARY:  While rioting in Jos continued into a second </p><p>straight day (Saturday), by mid-morning on Sunday,  9 </p><p>September, AmCits and GON officials were reporting that order </p><p>had been restored.  A 1600 to 0700 curfew governs daily life </p><p>until further notice, however.  Embassy received word that </p><p>the military forces were doing a conscientious job of </p><p>confiscating illicit weapons, restoring order and protecting </p><p>American lives and property.  The number of Nigerians injured </p><p>or killed at this time is unclear.  At this time, wardens are </p><p>re-assessing earlier AmCit requests for evacuation </p><p>assistance.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>============================= </p><p>SATURDAY - CONFLICT CONTINUED </p><p>============================= </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) PolOff 8 September received calls from Terry </p><p>Hammack, a missionary with the Society of International </p><p>Missionaries in Jos, Plateau State, at 0700 and 1100. </p><p>According to Hammack, who said he had traveled about the city </p><p>on his motorcycle, a pall of smoke from riot fires was </p><p>shrouding the city.  Fires had continued through the night, </p><p>and sounds of gunfire had resumed during the morning.  Some </p><p>injured Nigerians had begun arriving at the missionary </p><p>hospital at his compound (Hammack was unable to indicate the </p><p>number of injured).  According to Hammack, Jos was "closing </p><p>down."  Meanwhile, Post began to hear second-hand that some </p><p>AmCits resident in Jos wanted to leave. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) PolOff also spoke with Webe Boer, an Amcit and </p><p>former OTI employee at 1300.  Boer had heard that the curfew </p><p>was round-the-clock.  He believed the rioting had begun </p><p>around the Kongo Mosque (vice the Central Mosque).  Boer </p><p>stated he had witnessed Christian vigilante groups entering </p><p>and destroying Muslim houses in the Government Reserved Area </p><p>(GRA) where he and Hammack live.  Boer said he had heard word </p><p>that people were also coming into Jos from surrounding </p><p>villages to join the rioting.  According to Boer, this type </p><p>of conflict "had been brewing for about a year."  He stated </p><p>that he believed the prevalent attitude was that, after the </p><p>burning of churches the previous day, "Christians were </p><p>reminding Muslims that Jos is a Christian city."  Boer noted </p><p>that a nearby house belonging to the (Muslim) Governor of </p><p>Bauchi State had been burned. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Boer stated that he believed AmCits in Jos were </p><p>safe, and that he had not heard of any attacks against </p><p>missionary compounds.  However, he feared a possible wave of </p><p>reprisals against Christians from the Muslim community.  Boer </p><p>had not seen evidence of a police or military presence, but </p><p>he had heard both forces were active in the city.  Boer was </p><p>hopeful that an impending rainstorm would quench the violence. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Post One in Lagos notified Abuja Duty Officer at </p><p>1400 of a call from an Italian nun regarding the welfare of </p><p>two American nuns.  Duty Officer made contact with the </p><p>American nuns, Sister Barbara and Sister Rice, who reported </p><p>that a Mosque next to their compound (1 Utan Lane) had been </p><p>burned to the ground.  The Italian nun had believed their </p><p>compound had been destroyed, but this was apparently </p><p>incorrect.  The American nuns reported that they were safe. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>====================== </p><p>SUNDAY - CALM RESTORED </p><p>====================== </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) PolOff spoke with Hammack again on 9 September. </p><p>Hammack reported that by 1000 on 9 September, things had </p><p>"quieted down."  Hammack said the police and military had </p><p>taken over the streets.  He had reports that the area worst </p><p>hit during the rioting was Bukaru, 15 kilometers south of </p><p>Jos.  Hammack said that Bukaru had proportionally fewer </p><p>Muslims than Jos, and therefore, the Muslims had less </p><p>protection.  He had heard that "people had been slaughtered </p><p>in the streets."  The Embassy has not been able to confirm </p><p>this report. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) PolOff spoke with Boer again on 9 September.  Boer </p><p>stated he had been moving about the city with soldiers from </p><p>the 3rd Armored Division.  Boer stated that the soldiers were </p><p>conscientiously checking vehicles and anyone looking </p><p>suspicious, and had been confiscating weapons.  He said the </p><p>soldiers were being cheered everywhere they went, and said </p><p>they had been doing "a very good job, including protecting </p><p>Americans."  Boer urged PolOff to pass this praise on to the </p><p>General Officer, Commanding of the 3rd Armored Division.  He </p><p>also reported that he had heard from the other two American </p><p>Fulbright scholars living at the University of Jos that they </p><p>were safe. </p><p>============== </p><p>AMCIT WELFARE </p><p>============== </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) Post had received reports early Sunday afternoon that </p><p>up to 50 AmCits residing in Jos and the surrounding area </p><p>might wish to be evacuated to Abuja.  Post sent the following </p><p>message on the warden network and followed up with telephone </p><p>calls: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"There are Americans in Abuja who would welcome fellow </p><p>citizens into their homes for a few days in Americans living </p><p>in and around Jos would like to leave the area briefly. </p><p>Please convey through the Warden Network numbers of </p><p>individuals or families who might wish to accept this offer." </p><p>9.  (U) By early Sunday evening, with curfew in effect and a </p><p>heavy police and military presence on Jos streets, our AmCit </p><p>contacts were reporting the city quiet and were no longer </p><p>seeking immediate evacuation assistance.  We will stay in </p><p>touch with them through the night, as necessary.  If </p><p>required, Post can mobilize sufficient vehicles to evacuate </p><p>50 persons.  The Nigerian Police have offered to support an </p><p>evacuation effort, should we undertake one. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U) Amcits in the Jos area report that ISPs serving the </p><p>Jos community are either very slow or inaccessible.  If U.S. </p><p>relatives of Jos-based Amcits report being unable to reach </p><p>family members by email, the Department may wish to pass </p><p>along this information.  Basic telephone service is still </p><p>working in much of the city. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>==================== </p><p>CONTACT INFORMATION </p><p>==================== </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U) There is no full-time consular officer assigned to </p><p>Post.  Lagos-based American Citizens Services Officer Sherry </p><p>Sykes arrived in Abuja Sunday afternoon and will stay in the </p><p>capital for at least two days, after which time the need for </p><p>her presence will be reassessed.  She can be reached at the </p><p>residence of Wayne Hemmings and Denise Rollins </p><p>(234-9-413-5740).  Mr. Hemmings is Embassy Duty Officer until </p><p>OOB on September 12, and he is carrying the Duty Officer </p><p>mobile phone (234-90-802-237).  The Mission Guard Force can </p><p>be reached on 234-9-523-0916, -0960, -5857 or -2235 and can </p><p>reach Embassy Officers by radio. </p><p>Andrews </p><p></p></div>
