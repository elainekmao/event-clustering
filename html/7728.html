<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 002539 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NEA/ARN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/29/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, ELAB, JO, ILAB </p><p>SUBJECT: LABOR SUPPORTING PARLIAMENTARY CANDIDATE; UNION </p><p>LEADER OPTIMISTIC ON POST-SADDAM WORLD AND COOPERATION WITH </p><p>THE PALACE. </p><p> </p><p>REF: AMMAN 3761 (2002) </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: CDA GREGORY L. BERRY.  REASONS: 15. (B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY.  Fathallah Omrani, Vice President of the </p><p>Jordanian International Textile Workers Union, told us April </p><p>29 he is optimistic a parliamentary candidate in Irbid </p><p>endorsed by the textile union would be elected.  He was also </p><p>pleased to report increased contact with the Palace on </p><p>QIZ/labor issues.  Finally, Omrani noted that QIZ investors </p><p>are "much more relaxed" following the fall of Saddam\'s </p><p>regime, and reported hints that QIZ investment here may </p><p>benefit from the SARS epidemic in Asia.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>GETTING ORGANIZED: LABOR </p><p>BACKS PARLIAMENTARY CANDIDATE </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  On April 29, PolOff met with Fathallah Omrani. </p><p>Omrani was upbeat, and was happy to report that union-backed </p><p>Gibreel Abu Rahman, director of a large QIZ textile plant </p><p>near Irbid, was off to a strong start with his parliamentary </p><p>election campaign.  Last week, Omrani organized a meeting of </p><p>120 QIZ workers, where he stressed the need for the workers </p><p>and their families to vote, and to vote for Abu Rahman. </p><p>Omrani told the workers that having a parliamentarian who was </p><p>elected "by the laborers" is crucial.  He estimates that </p><p>there are over 2,500 votes in the Irbid QIZ factories. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Omrani said he understands that many are going to vote </p><p>for their own tribe\'s candidate, but expects the majority of </p><p>laborers in the district to go with Abu Rahman.  Omrani told </p><p>PolOff that many QIZ workers, male and female, have </p><p>volunteered to work for Abu Rahman\'s campaign. "Abu Rahman is </p><p>very, very popular.  He is the labor candidate.  People know </p><p>that the union, and the new QIZ jobs, have allowed people to </p><p>take care of themselves and their families."  He noted that </p><p>thousands of people have access to basic health care through </p><p>the union\'s cooperative health clinic that Omrani organized </p><p>with QIZ plant mangers and factory owners (reftel). </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>ROYAL PALACE IS \'LISTENING\' </p><p>TO LABOR CONCERNS </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  Omrani reported that he has direct contact with the </p><p>Royal Palace on labor issues.  In early April, Omrani was </p><p>invited to a roundtable meeting with King Abdullah to discuss </p><p>labor issues.  Since then, he has had an on-going dialogue </p><p>with Dr. Khalid Wazani, Director of the Economic Department </p><p>for the Royal Palace.  Omrani said this is a refreshing </p><p>change after being "ignored" for years by the Prime Ministry </p><p>and other GOJ ministries.  He noted that Wazani specifically </p><p>told Omrani to "talk with him first" -- as opposed to the </p><p>ministries -- on issues of concern.  Omrani was very happy to </p><p>report delivery of computers donated by the GOJ, which were </p><p>delivered recently by Wazani.  According to Omrani, Wazani </p><p>will visit the QIZ factories next week, but has requested </p><p>that it be "low-key" with no media or photo opportunities. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  Omrani was confident that investors will continue to </p><p>invest in the QIZs here.  With the war over, investors are </p><p>"much more relaxed," he said.  He also said that some </p><p>investors reportedly are looking away from investing in </p><p>traditional textile powerhouses in southeast Asia because of </p><p>SARS, and he expects a mild windfall for Jordanian QIZs. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C)  Omrani is a well organized, politically astute labor </p><p>leader.  Thus, we expect Abu Rahman to be have effective </p><p>backing in his parliamentary campaign in Southern Irbid. </p><p>Given the dearth of organized political entities beyond the </p><p>IAF, a victory by organized labor would be noteworthy. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) From the labor side, the QIZs appear to be in very </p><p>good shape post-Saddam.  Omrani, who has been outspoken and </p><p>disenchanted with the GOJ at various times over the past few </p><p>years, seems to be genuinely mollified by the Palace </p><p>attention to him and his cause, and encouraging union members </p><p>to participate in the forthcoming parliamentary elections. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>BIO NOTE </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) Gibreel Abu Rahman.  Abu Rahman is a </p><p>Palestinian-Jordanian in his mid-thirties.  In 1996, he began </p><p>working at the Al-Aser sewing factory in quality control and </p><p>has risen to become the director of the 2,400 worker textile </p><p>plant.  We have nominated him for this year\'s international </p><p>visitor\'s program. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
