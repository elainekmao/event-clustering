<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 03 KABUL 001015 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR ZKHALILZAD, JDWORKEN, HMANN, RHANSON, DSEDNEY </p><p>DEPT FOR SA/PAB, SA/AR, S/CT </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/18/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PINR, PTER, AF, PK </p><p>SUBJECT: SE KHALILZAD\'S APRIL 11 MEETING WITH NDS CHIEF </p><p>ENGINEER AREF </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMBASSADOR ROBERT P. FINN FOR REASONS </p><p>1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (S/NF) Summary: SE Khalilzad met on April 11 with National </p><p>Directorate of Security (NDS) Chief Engineer Aref to discuss </p><p>current security conditions, his views on proposed </p><p>US-Afghan-Pakistan trilateral discussions, and to review NDS </p><p>reform.  Aref told SE Khalilzad that Pakistan was indeed </p><p>promoting instability in Afghanistan and that trilateral </p><p>discussions might offer a way to address these activities. </p><p>Aref reported that security conditions were generally good, </p><p>but that the central government still lacked authority in the </p><p>provinces.  Also, the NSC, as a new institution on the Afghan </p><p>scene, was struggling to find its appropriate role and assert </p><p>its authority on security matters within the Cabinet. </p><p>Finally, Aref noted that the appropriate strategy for NDS </p><p>reform had been worked out with US assistance.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (S/NF) SE Khalilzad met with NDS Chief Engineer Aref on </p><p>April 11.  Khalilzad was accompanied by Ambassador, COS, </p><p>NSC,s Rebecca Hanson, DOD/OSD,s Mustafa Popal and </p><p>Econ/Commoff (notetaker).  Khalilzad said his perception was </p><p>that the security situation was generally good, but that the </p><p>Taliban was regrouping.  Khalilzad asked Aref his views in </p><p>this regard, and solicited his views on Afghan security </p><p>conditions and assessment of NDS reform.  Khalilzad also </p><p>proposed a trilateral military-intel working group </p><p>(Afghan-Pakistani-US) to address Taliban and extremist </p><p>activities in Afghanistan. Engaging Pakistan to cease its </p><p>support of extremist activities was one main goal of this </p><p>working group, SE Khalilzad said. </p><p> </p><p>3. (S/NF) Aref noted that ISI activities in Afghanistan were </p><p>still a problem, and that such ISI officers are deliberately </p><p>promoting extremism against Afghanistan.  Peshawar-based ISI </p><p>Officers including Sultan and General Wahid were tasking </p><p>Afghans to work against the Afghan central government.  Aref </p><p>alleged that ISI agents/assets working in Kandahar and </p><p>Jalalabad were providing free passage to terror elements to </p><p>cross into and out of Pakistan in vehicles loaded with arms. </p><p>Aref said this showed that Pakistan did not recognize Kabul </p><p>as Afghanistan,s central authority.  (Note: Aref alleged </p><p>that 6,000 &safe passage8 permits for Afghan commanders had </p><p>been issued ) NFI.)  In light of these activities, Aref </p><p>agreed that trilateral talks were a good idea, and could </p><p>supplement other contacts planned with ISI ) NFI.  SE </p><p>Khalilzad noted he would raise the possibility of opening </p><p>this trilateral channel with President Karzai during </p><p>discussions over NDS reform. </p><p> </p><p>4. (S/NF) Aref said security had undoubtedly improved </p><p>compared to the previous year.  The NDS had begun many new </p><p>projects with American assistance.  According to Aref, 90 </p><p>percent of their efforts had been successful, but five to ten </p><p>percent of enemy plans had succeeded (including sabotage and </p><p>provoking provincial tribes against the central government). </p><p>Aref noted that the enemy program to assassinate key leaders </p><p>) including President Karzai and Minister of Defense Fahim </p><p>) was still in place.  Aref noted that the war in Iraq had </p><p>inspired the madrassas to increase propaganda for jihad </p><p>against Americans and the &infidel8 Karzai government.  In </p><p>addition to propaganda, the Taliban had attempted small-scale </p><p>attacks (e.g., in Zormat and Kandahar).  Aref noted that NDS </p><p>foiled these attacks, adding that the Taliban strategy was to </p><p>find isolated pockets and manipulate the local population. </p><p> </p><p>5. (S/NF) Aref said that the Afghan government had certain </p><p>political weaknesses.  It has not been able to assert its </p><p>control over the provinces, and is not even in the position </p><p>to fire bad governors.  Aref said that, nonetheless, the </p><p>government had many achievements ) especially in the </p><p>security sector ) but more was needed to improve the lives </p><p>of Afghans.  We cannot simply police them, Aref said, and </p><p>nothing else.  Aref added that the National Security Council </p><p>structure was a completely new experience in Afghanistan, and </p><p>that it would take time to find is place and appropriate role </p><p>in the system.  The NSC was discussing how to incorporate </p><p>Ismail Khan and General Dostum into the government in Kabul. </p><p>Aref thought a solution would help improve security </p><p>conditions in the south as well.  In general, Aref continued, </p><p>there are internal and external threats.  Of the internal </p><p>threats, Aref emphasized the reluctance of certain prominent </p><p>elements within the Cabinet to implement the decisions of the </p><p>NSC.  Aref noted he had passed messages about this to both </p><p>the President and ORCA, as U.S. lives were also at stake. </p><p>Aref added that sometimes the government makes a decision </p><p>that is not well communicated to other parts of the </p><p>government. </p><p> </p><p>6. (S/NF) Aref said that clashes within the government were </p><p>not based upon ethnic or political differences ) as some </p><p>thought.  He offered the example of Minister Jalali, who was </p><p>an expatriate and a Pashtun, with whom he has quickly </p><p>established a good working relationship.  Jalali is given </p><p>broad license to interact with NDS elements without first </p><p>receiving clearances through Aref.  Aref offered one solution </p><p>to some of the problems discussed.  His suggestion was to </p><p>make former King Zahir Shah more effective.  The former king </p><p>enjoys respect and wants to help unify the nation, </p><p>particularly with problems in the South. </p><p>FINN </p><p></p></div>
