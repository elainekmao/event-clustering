<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 002007 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS, INR/NESA, S/CT; NSC FOR E. MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  10-28-12 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, PINR, CE, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  Biographic sketches of new members of LTTE </p><p>negotiating team slated to attend upcoming talks </p><p> </p><p>Ref:  Colombo 1682 </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by W. Lewis Amselem, Deputy Chief of </p><p>Mission.  Reasons 1.5 (b, d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Para three contains brief biographic sketches of </p><p>two new members of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam </p><p>(LTTE) negotiating team.  (Note:  The second round of </p><p>peace talks between the LTTE and the Sri Lankan </p><p>government is scheduled to take place in Thailand from </p><p>October 31 - November 3.)  The two new members of the </p><p>LTTE team are:  S.P. Thamilchelvam, the chief of the </p><p>LTTE\'s political wing; and Colonel V. Karuna, an </p><p>important LTTE military commander.  (Note:  See Reftel </p><p>for bio-data on the other members of the LTTE team: </p><p>Anton Balasingham, the head of delegation and LTTE </p><p>spokesman; Adele Balasingham, the secretary for the team </p><p>and spouse of Anton Balasingham; J. Maheswaran, a </p><p>development expert; and V. Rudrakumar, a LTTE legal </p><p>adviser based in the U.S.) </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Para four also contains bio-data on V. </p><p>Balakumaran, who was recently selected by the LTTE to </p><p>serve as its principal representative on the GSL-LTTE </p><p>Joint Task Force on humanitarian issues. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Brief biographic sketches of the two new LTTE </p><p>delegation members follow: </p><p> </p><p>-- S.P. Thamilchelvam, age approximately 38, is head of </p><p>the LTTE\'s political wing.  Thamilchelvam is the LTTE </p><p>official most often in the press explaining the group\'s </p><p>positions (aside from the LTTE\'s official spokesman, </p><p>Anton Balasingham).  Since the advent of the peace </p><p>process, he has often been on local and international </p><p>TV, and has been a key interlocutor with the Norwegian </p><p>government peace facilitation team.  In interviews, he </p><p>is soft-spoken, often flashing his trademark (and </p><p>somewhat unnerving) toothy grin.  In his current </p><p>position, Thamilchelvam is said to work very closely </p><p>with LTTE leader V. Prabhakaran. </p><p> </p><p>Before joining the political wing, Thamilchelvam served </p><p>in the LTTE\'s military wing in Jaffna, reportedly </p><p>fighting in many battles against Sri Lankan security </p><p>forces, as well against the Indian Peacekeeping Force </p><p>(IPKF).  In fighting against GSL forces near the Jaffna </p><p>town of Chavakachcheri in 1994, he suffered a serious </p><p>leg injury, and he still walks with a limp and the </p><p>assistance of a cane.  Thamilchelvam is said to have </p><p>been close to Mahattaya, a top LTTE official who was </p><p>killed in the early 1990s after coming into conflict </p><p>with Prabhakaran. </p><p> </p><p>Thamilchelvam is from Mavattapuram near Jaffna town.  He </p><p>attended high school at Union College in Tellippalai, </p><p>Jaffna.  As is the case with many LTTE leaders, </p><p>including Prabhakaran, he is from a lower caste within </p><p>the Hindu community.  (Note:  The name of the caste is </p><p>"Ambattar," which was traditionally for barbers.)  He </p><p>speaks Tamil, and some English and Sinhalese. </p><p> </p><p>-- Colonel V. Karuna, approximately 35, is an important </p><p>LTTE military commander, now serving the group as its </p><p>military chief in Ampara and Batticaloa Districts in the </p><p>Eastern province.  In addition to Paduman, the military </p><p>chief in Trincomalee, Karuna is the most senior LTTE </p><p>official in the east and apparently the most senior </p><p>eastern Tamil in the group\'s hierarchy.  Although he has </p><p>not been involved in the Norwegian facilitation talks </p><p>before, he has dealt extensively with the Norwegian-run </p><p>Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission (SLMM).  Observers say </p><p>Karuna has been included on the LTTE\'s negotiating team </p><p>to ensure that the eastern Tamil perspective is heard. </p><p>Unlike his recently sidelined colleague, Karikalan (one </p><p>name only), the former political chief in the </p><p>Batticaloa/Ampara sector, Karuna is not said to be </p><p>viscerally anti-Muslim.  In the early 1980s, Karuna </p><p>reportedly received military training in India sponsored </p><p>by RAW, the Indian intelligence organization.  He is </p><p>from the town of Kiran in Batticaloa District.  He </p><p>attended high school at Batticaloa Central College. </p><p>Aside from Tamil, he reportedly speaks adequate English </p><p>and broken Sinhalese. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Bio-data on V. Balakumaran, the LTTE\'s choice as </p><p>its head representative on the JTF, follows: </p><p> </p><p>-- Velupillai Balakumaran (alias "Banku Bala"), age </p><p>roughly 45, is said to be a close associate of </p><p>Prabhakaran on political issues.  He has been working on </p><p>humanitarian-related issues for the LTTE off-and-on for </p><p>the past decade, which is apparently why he was chosen </p><p>for the JTF position.  A longtime militant, he helped </p><p>form a group called EROS (Eelam Revolutionary </p><p>Organization) in 1975.  The group was Marxist-Leninist </p><p>in ideology.  In 1990, when EROS split into two, one </p><p>group led by Balakumaran joined the LTTE.  Balakumaran </p><p>reportedly received training in India and also </p><p>reportedly trained with Prabhakaran himself in the mid- </p><p>1970s at a Tamil militant camp near Vavuniya town in </p><p>north-central Sri Lanka.  He is reportedly relatively </p><p>well-educated and well-traveled for a LTTE official.  He </p><p>is from Jaffna. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
