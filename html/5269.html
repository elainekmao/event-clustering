<p>UNCLAS COLOMBO 000125 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FSINFATC FOR SPAS/POL: ELLEN COSGROVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA/INS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, AFSI, AFSN, PGOV, CE </p><p>SUBJECT:  Nomination for Political FSN training course </p><p> </p><p>Ref:  02 State 255305 </p><p> </p><p>1.  In response to Reftel, Mission nominates Ms. Padmini </p><p>Raajadurrai to attend the April 7 to 18 training course </p><p>for Political FSNs at NFATC. </p><p> </p><p>2.  Information on the nominee is keyed to the order of </p><p>the queries in Reftel: </p><p> </p><p>Name -- Padmini Raajadurrai </p><p>Grade -- FSN-10 </p><p>Length of Service -- 4 years and 5 months </p><p>Time spent in the U.S. -- 6 weeks (In 1979 and 2002 Ms. </p><p>Raajadurai vacationed in the U.S.) </p><p>Previous training in the U.S. -- None </p><p>Previous nominations for political training course -- </p><p>Yes, for May 2002 course </p><p> </p><p>3.  Narrative justification for nomination: </p><p> </p><p>The peace process between the Sri Lankan government and </p><p>the Tamil Tigers has sharply increased the Political </p><p>Section\'s workload.  Ms. Raajadurai\'s portfolio has been </p><p>crucial in this timeframe, as we turn to her constantly </p><p>for information on what is happening Tamil-speaking </p><p>areas, including those areas now controlled by the Tamil </p><p>Tigers, a notorious terrorist organization.  To keep </p><p>track of what is happening in the Tamil community, </p><p>Mission will be adding a Tamil-speaking Political </p><p>Officer in April 2003.  We expect that Raajadurai will </p><p>play a key role in educating this officer on the </p><p>situation in Sri Lanka, including travelling with him to </p><p>key points throughout the island. </p><p> </p><p>Raajadurrai has developed excellent contacts, and has </p><p>the ability to retrieve vast amounts of information from </p><p>those contacts in timely manner.  She also manages her </p><p>time well and responds to requests from the officers in </p><p>the Section in a timely manner.  Based on the </p><p>contributions she has made to the Section, she was </p><p>recently promoted to a FSN 10. </p><p> </p><p>With her recent promotion, however, she will be expected </p><p>to perform at an even higher-level. Raajadurrai has the </p><p>potential to do so, but must improve in certain areas. </p><p>The proposed training will enhance her interview, </p><p>briefing and drafting skills.  It will also assist in </p><p>defining what information is important to the USG. </p><p>Raajadurai is also becoming more involved in planning </p><p>certain aspects of VIP visits.  The training provided in </p><p>this area will be used regularly, as Embassy Colombo has </p><p>seen a surge in the number of visits since the advent of </p><p>the peace process. </p><p> </p><p>In addition, a new FSN recently joined the political </p><p>section.  If Raajadurai is selected to attend the </p><p>training, she can use the techniques and procedures she </p><p>learns at NFATC to assist the new FSN in learning his </p><p>responsibilities.  One of Raajadurrai\'s strengths is her </p><p>ability and willingness to share information with her </p><p>co-workers.  Thus, training for Raajadurai will have a </p><p>multiplier effect within the Political Section. </p><p> </p><p>Mission would also be able to use the time set aside for </p><p>consultations to great use.  The information that </p><p>Raajadurrai provides to the Mission is often shared </p><p>directly with the Department.  The opportunity to meet </p><p>directly with the offices we are reporting to will </p><p>assist her in fine tuning her information-gathering </p><p>towards fulfilling USG interests. </p><p> </p><p>Currently, neither of the two FSNs in the Mission\'s </p><p>Political Section have had the opportunity to take part </p><p>in a NFATC Political FSN training course.  It is </p><p>Mission\'s strong belief that providing Ms. Raajadurai </p><p>with political training will immeasurably improve the </p><p>Section\'s capabilities, thus helping Mission achieve </p><p>U.S. goals in Sri Lanka. </p><p> </p><p>AMSELEM </p><p></p></div>
