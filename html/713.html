(U) BEGIN TEXT: </p><p> </p><p>FELLOW GAMBIANS ! </p><p>ON THE 27TH OF JANUARY I FORMALLY RECEIVED THE REPORT OF </p><p>THE NATIONAL CONSULTATIVE COMMITTEE. I DESCRIBED THE </p><p>EVENT AS ANOTHER MAJOR STEP FORWARD IN THE </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ARMED FORCES PROVISIONAL RULING </p><p>COUNCIL\'S PROGRAM AND TIMETABLE FOR RETURN TO CIVILIAN </p><p>RULE. TWO FURTHER STEPS OF EVEN GREATER SIGNIFICANCE </p><p>HAVE SINCE BEEN TAKEN. BOTH THE COUNCIL AND THE CABINET </p><p>HAVE NOW CONSIDERED THE REPORT. </p><p> </p><p>ON THE OCCASION OF THE LAUNCHING OF THE PROGRAM AND </p><p>TIMETABLE ON THE 24TH OF OCTOBER, 1994, I PROMISED THAT </p><p>THEY WERE SUBJECT TO YOUR VIEWS. A FEW OF YOU EXPRESSED </p><p>YOUR VIEWS IN THE PAPERS AND IN OTHER WAYS. BUT THE </p><p>OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF YOU DID NOT PUBLICLY EXPRESS </p><p>YOUR VIEWS. </p><p> </p><p>ON THE 13TH OF DECEMBER, 1994, THE NOW FAMILIAR NATIONAL </p><p>CONSULTATIVE COMMITTEE WAS COMMISSIONED TO SOUND YOUR </p><p>OPINION, NATIONWIDE. I HAVE EXPRESSED MY THANKS AND </p><p>APPRECIATION, AND THOSE OF COUNCIL, FOR YOUR WILLING AND </p><p>PATRIOTIC PARTICIPATION IN THE IMPORTANT CONSULTATIONS </p><p>CARRIED OUT BY THE COMMITTEE. I SEIZE THIS OPPORTUNITY </p><p>TO THANK YOU ONCE MORE. </p><p> </p><p>IN FAIRNESS TO BOTH YOU, THE PEOPLE OF THE GAMBIA, AND </p><p>TO THE ARMED FORCES PROVISIONAL RULING COUNCIL, THE </p><p>NATIONAL CONSULTATIVE COMMITTEE HIGHLIGHTED THE </p><p>ENTHUSIASTIC WELCOME YOU ACCORDED TO THE BLOODLESS </p><p>MILITARY TAKEOVER, AND YOUR HAPPINESS THAT THREE DECADES </p><p>OF SELF-PERPETUATING RULE BY ONE POLITICAL PARTY WAS </p><p>OVERTURNED. THE COMMITTEE FOUND THAT YOU ACCORDED </p><p>LEGITIMACY AND EVEN BLESSINGS TO THE COUP. </p><p> </p><p>THE COMMITTEE ALSO RECOGNIZED THE NEED TO PROTECT YOU, </p><p>THE PEOPLE, AND THE NATION, AGAINST THE EXPLOITATION AND </p><p>MANIPULATION YOU SUFFERED DURING THE PAST THIRTY YEARS. </p><p>THE NEED FOR CIVIC EDUCATION PROVIDED FOR IN COUNCIL\'S </p><p>PROGRAM IS ENDORSED IN THE REPORT, AND SO ARE THE </p><p>PROPOSED CONSTITUTIONAL AND ELECTORAL REVIEWS. THE </p><p>COMMITTEE WAS ALSO IN ACCORD WITH THE PROPOSED REVIEW OF </p><p>CONSTITUENCY BOUNDARIES AND THE VOTERS REGISTRATION </p><p>SYSTEM. THE PROPOSAL TO ESTABLISH AN INDEPENDENT </p><p>ELECTORAL COMMISSION IS STRONGLY ENDORSED IN THE REPORT </p><p>AS LONG OVERDUE. </p><p> </p><p>THE REPORT ALSO REFLECTS THE EMPHASIS YOU PLACE ON THE </p><p>NEED TO COMPLETE THE WORK OF THE FIVE COMMISSIONS OF </p><p>INQUIRY INTO PUBLIC OFFICERS\' ASSETS, GOVERNMENT </p><p>DEPARTMENTS, PUBLIC CORPORATIONS, LAND ADMINISTRATION, </p><p>AND DONATED CRUDE AND REFINED OIL. MANY SPEAKERS AT THE </p><p>COMMITTEE\'S VILLAGE MEETINGS ARE SAID TO HAVE BEEN </p><p>EXTREMELY PASSIONATE, AND OTHERS VIVIDLY AGITATED, WHEN </p><p>ECHOING THE COUNCIL\'S DEMAND THAT EVERY BUTUT STOLEN </p><p>FROM GOVERNMENT BE RECOVERED. </p><p> </p><p>AT THE SAME TIME, HOWEVER, YOU HELD DIVERGENT VIEWS AS </p><p>FAR AS THE DURATION OF THE TRANSITION PERIOD WAS </p><p>CONCERNED. THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE IS EQUALLY IMPORTANT, </p><p>AND I WILL COME BACK TO IT LATER IN THIS BROADCAST. </p><p>IN THE MEANTIME, I NOW TURN TO WHAT THE COMMITTEE HAD TO </p><p>SAY ABOUT OUR DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS. THE REPORT RIGHTLY </p><p>REFLECTS THE FACT THAT OUR DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS HAD </p><p>APPLIED LIMITED ECONOMIC SANCTIONS AGAINST THE GAMBIA IN </p><p>IMMEDIATE RESPONSE TO THE MILITARY TAKEOVER. THEY HAD </p><p>ALSO, FOLLOWING THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE FOUR YEAR </p><p>TIMETABLE, APPLIED FURTHER SANCTIONS IN THE FORM OF A </p><p>TRAVEL ADVICE AGAINST VACATION IN THE GAMBIA, RESULTING </p><p>IN MASSIVE REDUNDANCIES IN THE TOURIST SECTOR, AND </p><p>CONSIDERABLE LOSS OF REVENUE OTHERWISE DUE TO THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT. THIS RESULTED IN THE CLOSURE OF VIRTUALLY </p><p>ALL THE HOTELS, THEREBY CAUSING CONSIDERABLE HARDSHIP </p><p>FOR MANY OF YOU. IT WAS A MATTER OF GREAT REGRET THAT </p><p>WHILE THE INTRICATE AND TIME CONSUMING ARRANGEMENTS WERE </p><p>BEING MADE TO SET UP THE COMMISSIONS, PREPARE THE </p><p>TRANSITION PROGRAM AND TIMETABLE, AND CARRY OUT THE </p><p>NATIONAL CONSULTATIONS, OUR DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS </p><p>UNILATERALLY DECIDED THAT THE PROPOSED FOUR YEAR </p><p>TRANSITION PERIOD WAS TOO LONG, AND IMPOSED THE SAID </p><p>SANCTIONS WHICH CAUSED SO MUCH HARDSHIP. THE COMMITTEE </p><p>CANNOT BE BLAMED FOR CONCLUDING THAT THIS UNDESERVED </p><p>PUNITIVE MEASURE IS MERELY BECAUSE THE GAMBIA IS DEVOID </p><p>OF NATURAL RESOURCES AND STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE. </p><p> </p><p>IN ORDER TO PROTECT THE TOURIST INDUSTRY, CONSIDERABLE </p><p>EFFORT WAS MADE BY THE MINISTRY OF INFORMATION AND </p><p>TOURISM TO ATTRACT TOURISTS FROM OTHER EUROPEAN </p><p>COUNTRIES. INTERESTED TOUR OPERATORS VISITED THE GAMBIA, </p><p>AND EXPRESSED THEIR INTENTION TO BRING IN TOURISTS NEXT </p><p>SEASON. IN THE MEANTIME, A SMALL NUMBER OF TOURISTS </p><p>CONTINUED TO COME FROM THE TRADITIONAL CATCHMENT AREA, </p><p>MAINLY IN BRITAIN, THANKS TO THE UNDERSTANDING AND </p><p>COOPERATION OF THE TOUR OPERATORS THE GAMBIA EXPERIENCE, </p><p>WHO DECLINED TO JOIN THE APPARENT BOYCOTT. THIS </p><p>ENCOURAGING GESTURE, AT THE TIME OF THE CRITICAL AND </p><p>UNEXPECTED ECONOMIC SITUATION DESCRIBED EARLIER, WAS, </p><p>AND STILL IS, DEEPLY APPRECIATED. </p><p> </p><p>WHILE DETERMINED EFFORTS WERE BEING MADE TO PROTECT THE </p><p>TOURIST INDUSTRY, THE VARIOUS TRANSITION ACTIVITIES I </p><p>HAVE JUST REFERRED TO WERE GOING ON SIMULTANEOUSLY. THE </p><p>OUTCOME OF THIS TWO PRONG APPROACH HAS BEEN A SUCCESSFUL </p><p>ONE. IN ADDITION TO THE PROSPECT OF ADDITIONAL TOUR </p><p>OPERATORS, AND THE WITHDRAWAL OF THE SWEDISH TRAVEL </p><p>ADVICE, THE NATIONAL CONSULTATIVE COMMITTEE CONCLUDED </p><p>ITS WORK AND SUBMITTED ITS REPORT. </p><p> </p><p>MANY OF THE COMMITTEE\'S RECOMMENDATIONS TALLY WITH THE </p><p>PROVISIONS AND ACTIVITIES IN COUNCIL\'S PROGRAM AND </p><p>TIMETABLE. THE MAIN EXCEPTIONS ARE THE AREA OF FORMING </p><p>AN INTERIM GOVERNMENT AND THE ADVICE TO HOLD NO </p><p>REFERENDUM. </p><p> </p><p>THERE ALREADY EXISTS AN INTERIM GOVERNMENT WITH A LARGE </p><p>CIVILIAN MAJORITY OF TWO TO ONE, AND THERE IS NO LOGICAL </p><p>REASON FOR FORMING A NEW ONE. </p><p> </p><p>AS FOR THE HOLDING OF A REFERENDUM A NUMBER OF CLAUSES </p><p>IN THE GAMBIAN CONSTITUTION, STILL IN FORCE, CALL FOR A </p><p>REFERENDUM BEFORE MAJOR AMENDMENTS ARE MADE. THE </p><p>INTRODUCTION OF A NEW CONSTITUTION WOULD THEREFORE MAKE </p><p>A REFERENDUM EVEN MORE DESIRABLE. FURTHERMORE, NO </p><p>CONSTITUTION OF THIS COUNTRY WAS EVER PUT TO YOU THE </p><p>PEOPLE FOR ADOPTION. THE NEW CONSTITUTION SHOULD </p><p>THEREFORE BE VOTED UPON IN A REFERENDUM. </p><p> </p><p>THE MAIN ISSUE ON WHICH THE NATIONAL CONSULTATIVE </p><p>COMMITTEE WAS CREATED TO ADVISE WAS THE DURATION OF THE </p><p>TRANSITION PERIOD- IN THIS REGARD THE COMMITTEE </p><p>RECOMMENDED A PERIOD OF TWO YEARS WITH EFFECT FROM THE </p><p>22ND OF JULY, 1994. I AM PLEASED TO INFORM YOU, THAT </p><p>HAVING CAREFULLY CONSIDERED THE COMMITTEE\'S OBSERVATIONS </p><p>AND RECOMMENDATIONS, AND TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ALL THE </p><p>PREVAILING CIRCUMSTANCES, AND, IN PARTICULAR, YOUR BEST </p><p>INTERESTS, COUNCIL AND THE CABINET HAVE ACCEPTED THIS </p><p>RECOMMENDATION. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FELLOW GAMBIANS! </p><p>WITH THE ISSUE OF THE TIMETABLE FINALLY BEHIND US, WE </p><p>SHOULD NOW TURN OUR ATTENTION, WHOLLY, TO NATIONAL </p><p>UNITY, AND TO THE FORMIDABLE TASK OF DEVELOPING THE </p><p>MOTHERLAND. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF PRIORITY DEVELOPMENT </p><p>PROJECTS IN OUR PROGRAM. THE MOST URGENT ONES INCLUDE </p><p>THE AUGMENTATION OF THE GENERATING CAPACITY OF KOTU </p><p>POWER STATION. THERE ARE ALSO A FEW ROAD AND SCHOOL </p><p>BUILDING PROJECTS. SOMETHING SHOULD ALSO BE DONE FOR THE </p><p>EASANT FARMERS AND THE YOUTHS. THE TRANSITION </p><p>ACTIVITIES SUCH AS THE COMMISSIONS, THE VARIOUS REVIEWS, </p><p>REGISTRATION OF VOTERS, AND GENERAL AND PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>ELECTIONS ARE ALSO THERE. </p><p> </p><p>I APPEAL TO ALL OF YOU TO PLAY YOUR PART IN THE NATIONAL </p><p>EFFORT TO ACHIEVE THESE OBJECTIVES. </p><p> </p><p>I ALSO APPEAL AGAIN TO THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, AS I </p><p>DID AT OUR NEW YEAR MEETING, TO RESUME THEIR NORMAL, </p><p>POSITIVE ROLE AS DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS. THERE IS A LOT OF </p><p>WORK TO BE DONE DURING THE SHORT TRANSITION PERIOD, AND </p><p>THE IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE AND ADVICE OF OUR DEVELOPMENT </p><p>PARTNERS WOULD FACILITATE AND ENHANCE RAPID PROGRESS. </p><p>I THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION. </p><p> </p><p>GOD BLESS YOU ! </p><p>LONG LIVE THE SECOND REPUBLIC ! </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  COMMENT:  AT A RECEPTION ON FEBRUARY 4 </p><p>AMBASSADOR SAW JUSTICE MINISTER MBYE, SECRETARY </p><p>GENERAL WADDA, AND CHAIRMAN OF THE NCC PETERS.  IN </p><p>SEPARATE CONVERSATIONS, ALL WERE VERY EUPHORIC OF </p><p>CHAIRMAN JAMMEH\'S ACCEPTANCE OF THE NCC\'S </p><p>RECOMMENDATIONS WHICH REFLECTED THE WILL OF THE </p><p>PEOPLE.  AMBASSADOR AGREED THAT IT WAS PREFERABLE </p><p>THAT THE CHAIRMAN HAD ACCEPTED RATHER THAN REJECTED </p><p>THE NCC RECOMMENDATIONS, BUT POLITELY AND FIRMLY TOLD </p><p>THEM THAT TWO YEARS WAS TOO LONG AND THAT A </p><p>DEMOCRATIC REFERENDUM ON THE LENGTH OF THE TIMETABLE </p><p>HAD NOT TAKEN PLACE.  THEY SEEMED SURPRISED AT THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR\'S NEGATIVE RESPONSE.  THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE </p><p>BEEN.  AS WE WILL REPORT BY SEPTEL, THE EU AND UK </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES WERE ALSO DISAPPOINTED WITH THE TWO </p><p>YEAR TIMETABLE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>WINTER </p><p></p></div>
