SUMMARY: DEPUTY PM GRANIC\'S RASH CRITICISM THIS WEEK OF </p><p>THE ZAGREB DIPLOMATIC CORPS -- INCLUDING THE U.S. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00927  01 OF 02  280635Z </p><p>AMBASSADOR -- EMBARRASSED THE GOC AND OVERSHADOWED AN </p><p>OTHERWISE SOLID ATTEMPT TO SENSITIZE THE CROATIAN PUBLIC TO </p><p>IMPENDING NEW INDICTMENTS AFTER THE APRIL 16 VISIT OF ICTY </p><p>PROSECUTOR CARLA DEL PONTE TO ZAGREB (REFTEL).  REACTING TO </p><p>PRESS REPORTS THAT ZAGREB DIPLOMATS AGREED WITH DEL PONTE </p><p>THAT GOC COOPERATION WITH ICTY WAS HALF-HEARTED, GRANIC, </p><p>INTER ALIA, CALLED ZAGREB-BASED DIPLOMATS "SUPERFICIALLY </p><p>INFORMED."  GRANIC\'S REMARKS DREW UNIFORMLY STINGING </p><p>CRITICISM FROM THE LOCAL MEDIA AS WE AND OTHER MISSIONS </p><p>REFUSED TO COMMENT AND LEFT THE GOC TO STEW IN ITS OWN </p><p>EMBARRASSMENT.  PM RACAN, WHO COUNTS ON GRANIC TO SUPPORT </p><p>THE COALITION AND TO MANAGE THE GOC, EVENTUALLY SAID THAT </p><p>HIS DEPUTY\'S VIEWS WERE "PERSONAL" AND DID NOT REFLECT THE </p><p>GOC\'S POSITION.  MEANWHILE, ICTY INDICTEE GENERAL JANKO </p><p>BOBETKO CHECKED HIMSELF OUT OF THE HOSPITAL, A POTENTIALLY </p><p>DISTURBING TWIST TO A CASE THAT ONLY TWO WEEKS AGO, THE GOC </p><p>AND THE OTP BOTH BELIEVED WAS CLOSED.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>FOOT IN MOUTH DISEASE </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) IN AN APRIL 22 INTERVIEW TO THE NEWS DAILY "NOVI </p><p>LIST," DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER GORAN GRANIC COMMENTED ON OTP </p><p>CHIEF PROSECUTOR CARLA DEL PONTE\'S APRIL 16 VISIT TO </p><p>ZAGREB.  GRANIC REMARKED THAT CROATIA WAS COOPERATING FULLY </p><p>WITH THE ICTY AND COMMITTED THE GOC TO DELIVER TO THE HAGUE </p><p>ANY NEW INDICTEES WITHOUT DELAY.  (CROATIAN MEDIA SOURCES </p><p>SPECULATE THAT DEL PONTE IS SET TO DELIVER UP TO FIVE NEW </p><p>INDICTMENTS AGAINST FORMER CROATIAN OFFICIALS: ADMIRAL </p><p>DAVOR DOMAZET, GENERALS IVAN KORADE AND MLADEN MARKAC, AND </p><p>FORMER PRIME MINISTERS HRVOJE SARINIC AND FRANJO GREGURIC.) </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00927  01 OF 02  280635Z </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) THE INTERVIEW WILL BE REMEMBERED FOR GRANIC\'S </p><p>PETULANT REACTION TO THE INTERVIEWER\'S REMARK THAT FOREIGN </p><p>DIPLOMATS AGREED WITH DEL PONTE\'S ASSESSMENT THAT CROATIA </p><p>ONLY COOPERATED WITH THE ICTY RELUCTANTLY.  GRANIC SAID </p><p>SOME DIPLOMATS "PROVED NOT TO BE UP TO THE MARK," WERE </p><p>SOMETIMES "RIDICULOUS IN THE WAY THEY MADE JUDGMENTS" AND </p><p>MADE STATEMENTS THAT WERE "DOWNRIGHT TRAGIC."  ASKED TO </p><p>NAME THE DIPLOMATS, GRANIC LISTED: "MEMBERS OF THE BRITISH </p><p>EMBASSY, THE U.S. AMBASSADOR, THE FORMER SPANISH </p><p>AMBASSADOR, DUTCH OFFICIALS," AND "OTHER SUPERFICIALLY </p><p>INFORMED DIPLOMATS, INCLUDING REPRESENTATIVES OF SOME </p><p>INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONS IN CROATIA." </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) GRANIC\'S INTERVIEW IGNITED A MEDIA FIRESTORM, </p><p>EVEN AS WE, AND OTHER MISSIONS, BIT OUR TONGUES.  A </p><p>COLUMNIST FOR NOVI LIST EXCORIATED HIM FOR USING A "TONE </p><p>THAT IS NOT TO BE USED EVEN WITH ONE\'S OWN STAFF," ADDING </p><p>THAT GRANIC HIMSELF HELPED FOSTER THE IMPRESSION THAT </p><p>CROATIA COOPERATED UNWILLINGLY, ESPECIALLY IN THE CASE OF </p><p>GENERAL BOBETKO.  ANOTHER COMMENTATOR FOR THE SAME PAPER </p><p>SAID GRANIC\'S STATEMENTS COULD HAVE BEEN EXPECTED IN IRAQ </p><p>UNDER SADDAM OR IN AFGHANISTAN UNDER THE TALIBAN, BUT NOT </p><p>IN A MODERN EUROPEAN COUNTRY THAT CROATIA ASPIRES TO </p><p>BECOME.  FOCUSING ON THE GOC\'S EU ACCESSION DRIVE, ONE </p><p>COMMENTATOR SAID, "WITH ONLY ONE MOVE, GRANIC MANAGED TO </p><p>ANNUL THE ENTIRE POSITIVE ATMOSPHERE THAT WAS PICKING UP IN </p><p>THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS."  A FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMENTATOR </p><p>FOR THE GOVERNMENT-OWNED DAILY "VJESNIK" NOTED THAT </p><p>GRANIC\'S WORDS RECALLED THE ATTITUDE OF THE HDZ GOVERNMENT, </p><p>WHICH VIEWED ZAGREB\'S INTERNATIONAL REPRESENTATIVES AS </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00927  01 OF 02  280635Z </p><p>"ENEMIES OF CROATIAN STATEHOOD." </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) GRANIC, HOWEVER, APPEARS TO HAVE AT LEAST SOME </p><p>SYMPATHIZERS IN THE GOC.  UNNAMED FOREIGN MINISTRY SOURCES </p><p>TOLD "NOVI LIST" THAT GRANIC MIGHT HAVE BEEN UNDIPLOMATIC, </p><p>BUT THAT HE HAD "AT LEAST TOLD THE TRUTH." "AMBASSADORS MAY </p><p>SPEAK LIKE THAT IN SOME BANTU STATE, BUT NOT IN CROATIA, </p><p>WHICH IS A PART OF EUROPE." </p><p> </p><p>WE\'RE SORRY (WELL, SORT OF) </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) AT A APRIL 24 PRESS CONFERENCE, PM RACAN SOUGHT </p><p>TO LIMIT DAMAGE, SAYING THAT HE REGRETTED GRANIC\'S REMARKS </p><p>AND THAT THEY DID NOT REFLECT THE POLICY OF THE GOC.  AT </p><p>THE SAME TIME, HE SOUGHT TO INSULATE HIS DEPUTY -- AND </p><p>RIGHT HAND MAN -- FROM FURTHER CRITICISM, SAYING THAT </p><p>INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS OF THE GOVERNMENT HAD THE RIGHT TO AIR </p><p>THEIR PERSONAL VIEWS, WHICH MIGHT NOT BE, AND OFTEN WERE </p><p>NOT, THOSE OF THE GOVERNMENT.  THERE WAS NO NEED FOR </p><p>FURTHER DISCUSSION ON THE ISSUE, RACAN MAINTAINED. </p><p> </p><p>BOBETKO CHECKS OUT: INITIAL GOC AND ICTY REACTIONS </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ6638 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  00927  02 OF 02  280635Z </p><p>ACTION IO-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AMAD-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00  INL-00   DODE-00 </p><p>      DS-00    EUR-00   FBIE-00  UTED-00  VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00 </p><p>      LAB-01   VCE-00   NSAE-00  OIC-02   PA-00    SP-00    TEST-00 </p><p>      DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-01   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00 </p><p>        /004W </p><p>                  ------------------5BE944  280635Z /38 </p><p>R 280625Z APR 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 0037 </p><p>EUROPEAN POLITICAL COLLECTIVE </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 02 ZAGREB 000927 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS:  KAWC, UNSC, ICTY, PREL, PGOV, PHUM, HR </p><p>SUBJECT:CROATIA/ICTY: DPM GRANIC SHOOTS GOC IN FOOT AS </p><p>BOBETKO ISSUE REFUSES TO FADE </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) AS THE GOC WAS DEALING WITH GRANIC\'S GAFFE, ON APRIL </p><p>24 ICTY INDICTEE GENERAL JANKO BOBETKO CHECKED HIMSELF OUT </p><p>OF THE HOSPITAL AND RETURNED HOME, REPORTEDLY AGAINST HIS </p><p>DOCTORS\' ORDERS.  RACAN COMMENTED THAT THIS WAS A MATTER </p><p>FOR THE GENERAL, HIS FAMILY AND HIS DOCTORS TO DECIDE, AND </p><p>NOT A SUBJECT FOR POLITICIANS.  "WE CANNOT DENY THE GENERAL </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00927  02 OF 02  280635Z </p><p>THE RIGHT TO GO HOME," RACAN SAID. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) ICTY ZAGREB REPRESENTATIVE THOMAS OSORIO TOLD US </p><p>APRIL 24 THAT THE IMMEDIATE CHALLENGE BEFORE THE GOC IS TO </p><p>ENSURE THAT IT REPORTS THE DEVELOPMENTS IMMEDIATELY TO THE </p><p>ICTY REGISTRAR.  OSORIO COMMENTED THAT THE GOC WOULD HAVE </p><p>TO KEEP THE REGISTRAR AND THE PRESIDING ICTY JUDGE WELL </p><p>INFORMED OF DEVELOPMENTS IN THE BOBETKO CASE.  IT IS </p><p>POSSIBLE THAT THE JUDGE MIGHT DECIDE THAT BOBETKO\'S </p><p>DECISION TO REFUSE HOSPITAL TREATMENT IS SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH </p><p>A CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCE TO WARRANT REACTIVATING THE ARREST </p><p>ORDER. </p><p> </p><p>MOON </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
