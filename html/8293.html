WHILE ITALY CAN AND DOES </p><p>GENERATE SCIENTIFIC BREAKTHROUGHS, ESPECIALLY IN </p><p>HISTORICALLY STRONG DISCIPLINES SUCH AS MEDICINE AND </p><p>PHYSICS, AND CAN PRODUCE BRILLIANT INNOVATIONS, IT DOES NOT </p><p>HAVE AT PRESENT EITHER THE NECESSARY LEVEL OF R AND D </p><p>FUNDING AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL OR THE CRITICAL MASS OF </p><p>KNOWLEDGE CHARACTERISTIC OF INTERNATIONAL TECHNOLOGY </p><p>CLUSTERS.  ITALIAN ATTEMPTS TO BUILD THESE LINKS TO DATE - </p><p>VIA SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY PARKS, CENTERS OF EXCELLENCE OR </p><p>DESIGNATED TECHNOLOGY "POLES" OR REGIONS - HAVE ACHIEVED </p><p>LIMITED SUCCESS.  ITALIAN INDUSTRY CONTINUES TO PLACE TOO </p><p>MUCH CONFIDENCE ON HIGH TECHNOLOGY TO GROW NEXT GENERATION </p><p>BUSINESS, WHETHER NEW OR TRANSFORMATIONS OF EXISTING </p><p>INDUSTRIES.

THE RESIGNATION OF FORMER CNR PRESIDENT </p><p>LUCIO BIANCO (REF D), UNDER FIRE FROM THE MINISTER FOR THE </p><p>LAST HALF YEAR, COULD BE A SIGNIFICANT STEP ALONG THE PATH </p><p>TO REFORM.  NEW CNR COMMISSIONER DESIGNATE ADRIANO DE MAIO </p><p>TOLD US ON MAY 20 THAT HE PLANS TO MOVE ON MORATTI\'S PROGRAM </p><p>WITH A MINIMUM OF TALK AND A MAXIMUM OF ACTION.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>CNR REFORM REDUX? BACKGROUND AND STATUS </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U)  ON JAN. 31, 2003 THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS ISSUED A </p><p>DRAFT DECREE TO REFORM THREE RESEARCH INSTITUTES (THE </p><p>NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL - CNR, THE SPACE AGENCY - ASI, AND </p><p>THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ASTROPHYSICS - INAF).  WHILE </p><p>REFORM FOR ASI AND INAF IMPLIES MINOR CHANGES, THE CNR WOULD </p><p>BE RADICALLY RESTRUCTURED, AND THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS </p><p>DECIDED TO APPOINT A COMMISSIONER (PROF. ADRIANO DE MAIO) TO </p><p>OVERSEE THE REFORM.  CURRENT CNR PRESIDENT LUCIO BIANCO </p><p>APPEALED TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE REGIONAL COURT (TAR) WHICH </p><p>SUSPENDED HIS DISMISSAL ON FEB. 20.  ON MAY 13, BIANCO </p><p>RESIGNED WHEN HE LEARNED THAT THE RESEARCH REFORM PROPOSAL </p><p>HAD BEEN SUPPORTED BY THE TECHNICAL ADVISORS OF THE COUNCIL </p><p>OF MINISTERS, WHICH APPROVED THE REFORM LAW DECREES ON MAY </p><p>16 (REF D). </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  02330  01 OF 06  310644Z </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) THE LATEST REORGANIZATION CONFIRMED A SERIES OF </p><p>INITIATIVES THAT DATES FROM 1999 (REFS A-C).  THE 1999 </p><p>REFORM, WHICH CONSOLIDATED THE MORE-THAN-300 INSTITUTES OF </p><p>CNR INTO 108, TURNED OUT TO SIMPLY RENAME THE HEADS OF THE </p><p>INSTITUTES TO DIVISION DIRECTOR POSITIONS AND FAILED TO </p><p>ACHIEVE THE ECONOMIES OF SCALE OR INTERDISCIPLINARY ACTIVITY </p><p>INTENDED BY THE REFORM.  ONE POSITIVE ACHIEVEMENT WAS THE </p><p>INTRODUCTION OF A PEER-REVIEW SYSTEM FOR THE EVALUATION OF </p><p>RESEARCH PROPOSALS. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) CNR WAS HELD UP TO PUBLIC SCRUTINY FOR ITS MORIBUND </p><p>WAYS SEVERAL TIMES IN THE FALL OF 2001 IN NATURE MAGAZINE, </p><p>PARTICULARLY IN ITS INTERNATIONAL SEARCH FOR NEW CNR </p><p>INSTITUTE DIRECTORS, ALL OF WHOM TURNED OUT ULTIMATELY TO BE </p><p>ITALIAN AND FORMER CNR DIRECTORS.  ACCORDING TO A PRESS </p><p>ARTICLE, THE CORTE DEI CONTI (THE SUPREME ADMINISTRATIVE </p><p>COURT) COMMENTED ON THE CNR REFORM IN AUGUST 2002: "108 </p><p>INSTITUTES SURVIVED A REFORM WHICH ESSENTIALLY WAS LIMITED </p><p>TO AGGREGATIONS WITHOUT A STRATEGIC DESIGN AND JUST MOVED </p><p>INSTITUTES INTO OTHER INSTITUTES INSTEAD OF CLOSING THEM. </p><p>MOREOVER, THE FACT THAT THE INSTITUTES ARE LOCATED </p><p>[GEOGRAPHICALLY] FAR FROM EACH OTHER INCREASES THE RISK OF </p><p>DUPLICATIVE ACTIVITY THAT WAS TYPICAL OF THE PREVIOUS CNR </p><p>ORGANIZATION AND THUS SUBSTANTIALLY BETRAYS THE AIM OF THE </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ8139 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  02330  02 OF 06  310645Z </p><p>ACTION OES-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   CIAE-00  DINT-00  DODE-00  DOEE-00  SRPP-00 </p><p>      EB-00    EUR-00   E-00     UTED-00  VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00 </p><p>      IO-00    L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  NSF-01 </p><p>      OIC-02   PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   SP-00    SSO-00   SS-00 </p><p>      TEST-00  T-00     USIE-00  EPAE-00  PMB-00   G-00     SAS-00 </p><p>        /004W </p><p>                  ------------------6D7D50  310645Z /21 </p><p>R 280806Z MAY 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 0103 </p><p>USDOC WASHDC </p><p>WHITE HOUSE WASHDC </p><p>INFO AMCONSUL MILAN </p><p>AMCONSUL FLORENCE </p><p>AMCONSUL NAPLES </p><p>EU MEMBER STATES COLLECTIVE </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 06 ROME 002330 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR NSF REP SCHINDEL </p><p>DEPT FOR OES/STC AND STAS, EUR/WE </p><p> </p><p>WHITE HOUSE FOR OSTP </p><p>USDOC FOR TA MILLICK </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  02330  02 OF 06  310645Z </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: TSPL, KSCA, TBIO, TPHY, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: SWEEPING ITALIAN RESEARCH REFORMS SWEEP OUT CNR </p><p>PRESIDENT BIANCO BUT MAY NOT SWEEP IN INDUSTRIAL INNOVATION </p><p> </p><p>REFORM."

THE </p><p>DEPARTMENTS, ALSO CALLED "MACRO-AREAS", WILL BE: </p><p> </p><p>1)   BIOTECHNOLOGIES </p><p>2)   MEDICAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGIES </p><p>3)   MATERIALS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGIES (INCLUDING </p><p>   NANOTECHNOLOGIES) </p><p>4)   ENVIRONMENT AND EARTH SCIENCES AND TECHNOLOGIES </p><p>5)   INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION SCIENCES AND TECHNOLOGIES </p><p>6)   ADVANCED PRODUCTION SYSTEM SCIENCES AND TECHNOLOGIES </p><p>7)   JURIDICAL AND ECONOMIC SCIENCES </p><p>8)   HUMANISTIC SCIENCES </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  02330  02 OF 06  310645Z </p><p>THE EIGHT DEPARTMENTS WILL 1) COORDINATE THE INSTITUTES </p><p>WITHOUT DUPLICATION OF ACTIVITY; 2) ALLOCATE FUNDS ACCORDING </p><p>TO THE PROGRAMS AUTHORIZED BY A NEW ADMINISTRATIVE BOARD; 3) </p><p>ENTER INTO THE EUROPEAN EXCELLENCE NETWORK, AND PROMOTE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL CONTACTS; AND 4) SUPPORT COOPERATION WITH THE </p><p>INDUSTRIAL SECTOR. </p><p> </p><p>6. (U)  THE NEW REFORM ALSO PROVIDES FOR: </p><p>-  CREATION OF AN ADMINISTRATIVE BOARD - A GOVERNING BODY - </p><p>COMPOSED OF THE CNR PRESIDENT AND SIX PROMINENT </p><p>SCIENTISTS/MANAGERS NOMINATED BY THE MINISTRY, THE STATE- </p><p>REGION CONFERENCE, THE UNIVERSITIES RECTORS CONFERENCE, THE </p><p>CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE, AND CONFINDUSTRIA (INDUSTRIES </p><p>ASSOCIATION). </p><p>- A NEW SCIENTIFIC COUNCIL (20 MEMBERS NOMINATED BY THE </p><p>ADMINISTRATIVE BOARD, THE CNR PRESIDENT, THE CNR </p><p>RESEARCHERS, AND THE NATIONAL COUNCIL OF ECONOMY AND LABOR) </p><p>- A NEW EVALUATION COMMITTEE (EIGHT CNR-EXTERNAL MEMBERS </p><p>NOMINATED BY THE MINISTRY, THE STATE-REGION CONFERENCE, THE </p><p>UNIVERSITIES RECTORS CONFERENCE, THE CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE) </p><p>- A NEW COUNCIL OF DEPARTMENTS DIRECTORS (CNR PRESIDENT, DG, </p><p>AND DIRECTORS) </p><p>- A NEW AUDITORS\' COMMITTEE (THREE MEMBERS NOMINATED BY THE </p><p>RESEARCH MINISTRY AND BY THE ECONOMY MINISTRY) </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>ITALIAN SCIENTISTS ARE DIVIDED BY WHOSE OX IS GORED </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>7.

ON FEB. </p><p>12, 2003, PROF. BIANCO SAID THAT "THIS GOVERNMENT </p><p>(BERLUSCONI\'S) CUTS THE FUNDS AND PILOTS THE MANAGEMENT OF </p><p>WHAT IS LEFT."  IN PARTICULAR, BIANCO AND OTHER MEMBERS OF </p><p>THE CURRENT BOARD OF DIRECTORS, OPPOSED THE CREATION OF THE </p><p>NEW DEPARTMENTS, WHICH WOULD INCREASE THE "CENTRAL </p><p>BUREAUCRACY".  COMMENT:  ACTUALLY, THE WHOLE POINT OF THE </p><p>MORATTI REFORM IS TO REDUCE THE CNR BUREAUCRACY, WHICH WAS </p><p>UNRESPONSIVE TO DIRECT INSTRUCTIONS FROM THE MINISTRY DURING </p><p>BIANCO\'S TENURE.

(U) ATTEMPTS TO STRENGTHEN THE LINKAGE BETWEEN THE </p><p>RESEARCH COMMUNITY AND INDUSTRIAL SECTORS ARE MANY, FROM </p><p>RESEARCH CONTRACTS AWARDED TO UNIVERSITIES, TO THE </p><p>ESTABLISHMENT OF A NATIONAL NETWORK OF TECHNOLOGY AND </p><p>SCIENCE PARKS, TO THE DESIGNATION OF NATIONAL CENTERS OF </p><p>EXCELLENCE (A PROJECT BEGUN TWO YEARS AGO, WHICH HAS LARGELY </p><p>COLLAPSED), TO THE DESIGNATION BY THE MARKETING OF RESEARCH </p><p>OF ITALIAN REGIONS AS "POLES" FOR TECHNOLOGY INNOVATIONS </p><p>(E.G. TORINO FOR ICT, VENETO FOR NANOTECHNOLOGIES).  THE </p><p>DATA OVERALL SUGGESTS THAT WHILE THESE GOVERNMENT LED AND </p><p>FINANCED INTERVENTIONS YIELD SOME RESULTS, THE PROBLEMS </p><p>IDENTIFIED ABOVE PERSIST.  IN A RECENT VISIT TO THE </p><p>UNIVERSITY OF TRIESTE AND THE AREA SCIENCE PARK, ESTCOUNS </p><p>REVIEWED DATA WHICH SUGGEST THAT THE "HIGH-TECH" STRATEGY OF </p><p>THE REGION OF FRIULI-VENEZIA-GIULIA IN THE NORTHEAST OF </p><p>ITALY HAS SIGNIFICANT SHORTCOMINGS.  A REVIEW OF THE </p><p>TRADITIONAL INDUSTRIES OF THE REGION--FURNITURE, PAPER, FOOD </p><p>INDUSTRIES-- AND THE INVESTMENT STRATEGIES OF THE AREA PARK </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  02330  05 OF 06  310646Z </p><p>AND THE SURROUNDING INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH CENTERS - ICGEB </p><p>AND ICTP, MADE CLEAR THAT THERE ARE MANY OPPORTUNITIES FOR </p><p>EDUCATION IN SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING, BUT MANY FEWER FOR </p><p>RELEVANT EMPLOYMENT IN LOCAL INDUSTRY.  ACCORDINGLY, TRIESTE </p><p>EXPERIENCES AN "OUT-MIGRATION" OF ITS BEST-EDUCATED TO </p><p>MILANO, TORINO, AND HIGH-TECH AREAS OUTSIDE OF ITALY. </p><p>WITHIN THE SCIENCE PARK ITSELF THERE ARE A NUMBER OF SPIN- </p><p>OFF COMPANIES, BUT THEIR PRODUCTION IS MORE LIKELY TO BE </p><p>RELATED TO THE RESEARCH CENTERS THAN TO LOCAL INDUSTRY. </p><p>ACCORDINGLY, THEY STAY SMALL, HAVE CUSTOMERS OUT-OF-THE- </p><p>REGION, AND LITTLE PROSPECT FOR GROWTH.  THEY REMAIN IN THE </p><p>SCIENCE PARK FOR THE SIMPLE REASON OF SUBSIDIZED SPACE FOR </p><p>LABS AND OFFICE.  SINCE THE SCIENCE PARK DOES NOT HAVE A </p><p>LIMIT ON THE TIME PERIOD SPIN-OFFS MAY REMAIN UNDER </p><p>SUBSIDIZED CONDITIONS (A GO AND GROW POLICY) A SMALL COMPANY </p><p>PROVIDING A HIGHLY SPECIALIZED PRODUCT, LIKE TESTING OR </p><p>DIAGNOSTIC EQUIPMENT, WITH A LIMITED MARKET CAN SURVIVE </p><p>UNDER THESE SUBSIDY CONDITIONS-POTENTIALLY TAKING SPACE FROM </p><p>NEWER SPIN-OFFS WITH BETTER PROSPECTS FOR GROWTH.  NOR HAS </p><p>AREA SCIENCE PARK OR THE REGION DEVELOPED A SUCCESSFUL </p><p>INTERNAL MARKETING STRATEGY OR INCENTIVES TO ATTRACT FOREIGN </p><p>COMPANIES OR INVESTMENTS TO CREATE A SERIOUS INTERNATIONAL </p><p>INNOVATION CLUSTER.  THE SAME STORY COULD BE TOLD FOR OTHER </p><p>SCIENCE OR TECHNOLOGY PARKS IN ITALY, WITH AREA PARK IN </p><p>TRIESTE, THE OLDEST, BEST DOCUMENTED, AND GENERALLY REGARDED </p><p>AS THE MOST SUCCESSFUL. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>WHY DOES ITALY BEAT THE ODDS? </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  02330  05 OF 06  310646Z </p><p>19. (U) DESPITE ALL THESE NEGATIVES--LOW DOMESTIC PUBLIC AND </p><p>PRIVATE R AND D, POOR LINKAGES BETWEEN RESEARCHERS AND </p><p>INDUSTRY, LOW LEVELS OF INNOVATION AND FEW REGIONAL </p><p>INNOVATION CLUSTERS--IT REMAINS TRUE THAT ITALIAN RESEARCH </p><p>IS HIGHLY REGARDED INTERNATIONALLY, AND THAT ITALIAN </p><p>MANUFACTURED GOODS HAVE A REPUTATION FOR HIGH QUALITY. </p><p>EXPLANATIONS LIE IN THE EVIL WAYS OF AVERAGING, AND IN THE </p><p>STRUCTURE OF MEASURING R AND D AND INNOVATION. </p><p> </p><p>20. (SBU) WHILE ONLY ANECDOTAL DATA IS AVAILABLE, INTERVIEWS </p><p>WITH UNIVERSITY AND INSTITUTE RESEARCHERS POINT IN SEVERAL </p><p>CONSISTENT DIRECTIONS.  FIRST IS A GENERATION GAP, WITH MANY </p><p>RESEARCHERS NOW IN MID-CAREER BRINGING MORE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>EXPERIENCE (AND ASSOCIATED EXTERNAL FUNDING) TO THEIR </p><p>LABORATORIES.  THE MORE COMPETITIVE NATURE OF INTERNATIONAL </p><p>FUNDS HAS SHARPENED THE QUALITY OF RESEARCH PROPOSALS AND </p><p>THE NEED FOR QUALITY RESULTS.  ALTHOUGH NO RELIABLE DATA ON </p><p>EXTRAMURAL FUNDING IS AVAILABLE (DE MAIO CONFIRMED THIS ON </p><p>MAY 20), EMBASSY BELIEVES THAT FUNDING FROM EU AND NON-EU </p><p>SOURCES LIKE NIH COMPRISE A SIGNIFICANT PART OF THE </p><p>FINANCIAL RESOURCES OF THE BEST ITALIAN RESEARCHERS, </p><p>CREATING A TWO-TIER SYSTEM WHICH SOME RESEARCHERS RECEIVE </p><p>SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER SHARES OF FUNDING BASED ON QUALITY OF </p><p>RESEARCH.

HOWEVER, TWO IMPORTANT FORMS OF INCREMENTAL </p><p>INNOVATION ARE OVERLOOKED OR ONLY INCOMPLETELY CAPTURED BY </p><p>THE USUAL STATISTICAL REPORTS.  FIRST IS ONGOING PRODUCT </p><p>DEVELOPMENT, WHICH EVEN SMALL FIRMS DO AS A MATTER OF </p><p>SURVIVAL, CHANGING MATERIALS, ASSEMBLY PROCEDURES, FIT AND </p><p>FINISH (PAINTS, COATINGS, POLISHING OF SURFACES), AND </p><p>IMPROVING QUALITY CONTROL TO REDUCE PRODUCTION COSTS, </p><p>INCREASE RELIABILITY, AND IMPROVE COMPETITIVENESS IN THE </p><p>MARKET PLACE.  THE SECOND INNOVATION STRATEGY OFTEN ONLY </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  02330  06 OF 06  310647Z </p><p>INCOMPLETELY CAPTURED BY STATISTICS IS THE INTRODUCTION OF </p><p>NEW PRODUCTION METHODS VIA NEW MANUFACTURING PROCESSES AND </p><p>EQUIPMENT.  OFTEN NO R AND D IS REQUIRED, BECAUSE THE </p><p>TECHNOLOGIES ARE SUFFICIENTLY MATURE AND ALREADY </p><p>DEMONSTRATED.  FOR A SMALL COMPANY, NEW PRODUCTION MACHINERY </p><p>CAN SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCE COSTS BY USING LESS MATERIALS STOCK </p><p>IN PRODUCTION (FURNITURE MANUFACTURING, FOR EXAMPLE), </p><p>INCREASING UNIFORMITY AND FIT OF COMPONENTS, AND BY </p><p>INCREASING WORKER PRODUCTIVITY AND HENCE REDUCING COSTS PER </p><p>UNIT OF OUTPUT.  AND OF COURSE, SMALL AGILE FIRMS ENGAGED IN </p><p>CUSTOM PRODUCTION OFTEN FACE THE NEED TO INVENT TOOLS AND </p><p>TECHNOLOGIES TO MEET THE NEEDS OF DIVERSE CLIENTS, AND THEIR </p><p>"WETWARE" IS OFTEN MORE IMPORTANT THEN THEIR EQUIPMENT BASE. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>CONCLUSION - MISSING OR CATCHING THE WAVE? </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>22.

THE FLAWS ARE </p><p>TOO LITTLE MONEY OVERALL, AND A BELIEF BY THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>THAT SHIFTING SOME MONEY FROM BASIC RESEARCH TO APPLIED </p><p>RESEARCH OF COMMERCIAL RELEVANCE WILL BE ENOUGH TO ENCOURAGE </p><p>INDUSTRY TO MORE ACTIVELY "PULL" RESEARCH RESULTS INTO THE </p><p>ITALIAN ECONOMY.  HOWEVER, LEAVING ASIDE BIG PLAYERS LIKE </p><p>PARASTATAL FINMECCANICA, WHICH INVESTED 350 MILLION EUROS IN </p><p>R AND D LAST YEAR, FEW ITALIAN COMPANIES HAVE THE KNOW-HOW </p><p>OR AVAILABLE MONEY TO LOOK VERY FAR UPSTREAM FOR NEW </p><p>TECHNOLOGIES.
