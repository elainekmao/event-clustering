<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 004652 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARN, NEA/PA, NEA/AIA, INR/NESA, R/MR, </p><p>I/GNEA, B/BXN, B/BRN, NEA/PPD, NEA/IPA FOR ALTERMAN </p><p>USAID/ANE/MEA </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH </p><p>PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p>USCINCCENT//CCPA, USCENTCOM REAR MACDILL AFB FL </p><p>STATE PASS TO AID </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p> </p><p>TAGS: KMDR JO </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON U.S.-ARAB RELATIONS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                        Summary </p><p> </p><p>Lead story in all papers today, August 19, highlights </p><p>the beginning of Israel\'s withdrawal from Gaza and </p><p>Bethlehem.  Front-page wire-service reports quote the </p><p>Israeli Ministry of Defense, following a security </p><p>meeting with the Palestinians, as saying that the </p><p>implementation of "Gaza First" plan will commence </p><p>August 19.  Both Al-Arab Al-Yawm and Al-Dustour Arabic </p><p>dailies carry wire service reports citing former U.S. </p><p>Secretary of State Eagleburger\'s "objection" to an </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>American "intervention" in Iraq "now".  These reports </p><p>are carried under the headline claiming an American </p><p>campaign to "invent" justifications for an attack on </p><p>Iraq.  Editorial commentaries principally dealt with </p><p>developments in Arab-American relations, with </p><p>commentators feeding the growing perception that the </p><p>goals of the U.S. war on terrorism are shifting to a </p><p>broader offensive against all Arab regimes.  At the </p><p>same time, one influential columnist sought to put in </p><p>perspective the outcry over the U.S. reaction to the </p><p>Saad Eddin Ibrahim case by pointing out that a </p><p>nation\'s decision to withhold assistance can hardly be </p><p>termed "intervention".  True intervention, he </p><p>continued, is what America is doing in Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>                 Editorial Commentary </p><p> </p><p>-- "Reviewing Arab-American relations" </p><p> </p><p>Chief Editor Taher Udwan writes on the back page of </p><p>independent, mass-appeal Arabic daily Al-Arab Al-Yawm </p><p>(08/19):  "The `war on terrorism\' that the Bush </p><p>administration announced is shifting away from its </p><p>original objectives of pursuing Al-Qa\'eda and moving </p><p>towards pursuing Arab regimes without discrimination. </p><p>Day in and day out, it becomes clear that the Iraqi </p><p>regime is not the only target in this war on </p><p>terrorism.  There are targets that are being created </p><p>in the Arab world by the warmongers in the Pentagon. </p><p>Would that these developments push the Arab countries </p><p>towards an organized and responsible reassessment of </p><p>Arab-American relations before the iron gets too hot." </p><p> </p><p>-- "A new form of international relations" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Mazen Saket writes on the op-ed page </p><p>of center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(08/19):  "The American war against terrorism is </p><p>expanding in our Arab region and is turning into an </p><p>attack against all those who disagree with the United </p><p>States and fail to do its bidding.  The media campaign </p><p>against Saudi Arabia continues . and political and </p><p>economic pressures against Egypt increase.  We can </p><p>almost be certain that the U.S. plans for and </p><p>pressures on the countries of this region are behind </p><p>the recent media campaign against Jordan.  It is an </p><p>America campaign that seeks to force moderate </p><p>political regimes to go along with American schemes </p><p>and even take part in them.  To oppose a military </p><p>strike against Iraq and criticize the U.S. policy in </p><p>favor of Israel\'s aggressiveness and expansionism is </p><p>enough for the U.S. administration to consider those </p><p>countries and regimes as targets for political, </p><p>economic and media pressure campaigns.  The U.S. </p><p>administration\'s new form of relations with the Arabs </p><p>is not a reaction to the September 11 attacks, nor is </p><p>it a defense of American interests or a war against </p><p>terrorism and extremism; it is a return to </p><p>colonization." </p><p> </p><p>-- "American intervention in Egypt and Iraq" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Fahd Fanek writes on the back page of </p><p>semi-official, influential Arabic daily Al-Ra\'i </p><p>(08/19):  "The Egyptian opposition criticized American </p><p>intervention in Egypt\'s domestic affairs, but said </p><p>nothing about the American intervention in Iraq\'s </p><p>domestic issues.  This `intervention\' [in Egypt] is </p><p>theoretical and is not borne out by proof on the </p><p>ground.  There is no `additional\' assistance for Egypt </p><p>simply awaiting the President\'s approval.  On the </p><p>contrary, there has been talk for years about </p><p>decreasing U.S. assistance to Egypt and Israel.  In </p><p>addition, not giving further assistance can hardly be </p><p>considered intervening in (another country\'s) domestic </p><p>issues.  The U.S. government is free to do what it </p><p>feels like with its taxpayers\' money.  The countries </p><p>that receive this assistance know that such assistance </p><p>depends on the donor countries\' approval of their </p><p>conduct.  Even the nature of the American </p><p>`intervention\' is not clear.  The human rights </p><p>activist Saad Eddin Ibrahim is an American citizen </p><p>after all, and as such, the United States must try to </p><p>help him out.  The flagrant and blatant type of </p><p>American intervention is the one that is happening in </p><p>Iraq, [not Egypt]."  BERRY </p><p></p></div>
