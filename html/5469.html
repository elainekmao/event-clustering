<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 000196 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA/INS, G/TIP, PRM, AND INL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, KCRM, KWMN, EAID, SMIG, ELAB, KPAO, CE, Human Rights </p><p>SUBJECT:  Sri Lanka:  Proposal for anti-trafficking in </p><p>persons (TIP) project for FY 2003 </p><p> </p><p>Ref:  STATE 241260 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Per Reftel, Mission is providing the attached </p><p>program proposal to strengthen the capabilities of the </p><p>Sri Lankan National Child Protection Agency (NCPA) in </p><p>enforcing the government\'s laws regulating trafficking </p><p>of children in regards to prostitution and labor. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Attached is the project description based on the </p><p>outline provided in para. 14 of Reftel. </p><p> </p><p>BEGIN TEXT </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>A. Title:  Program to enhance Civil and Police </p><p>Coordination and Investigation Techniques in Preventing </p><p>the Trafficking of Children </p><p> </p><p>B. Name of Organization:  National Child Protection </p><p>Agency (NCPA), The Police Unit attached to the NCPA, and </p><p>the Police Division on Women\'s and Children\'s Issues. </p><p> </p><p>C. Duration:  One year. </p><p> </p><p>D. Objective:  The program will enhance the coordination </p><p>capabilities between the civilian investigators and </p><p>policy advisors with the police officers investigating </p><p>the crimes.  Particular focus should be on the </p><p>coordination between the civilian and police offices </p><p>within the NCPA.  A brief inprocessing/training program </p><p>should be established to bring new personnel into an </p><p>organization where the operations of the police and </p><p>civilian personnel must be intricately connected to </p><p>operate well.  In addition, a review should be conducted </p><p>to see which resources would most help the NCPA in its </p><p>mandate (reviewing items ranging from investigative </p><p>hardware to software for internal computer systems). </p><p> </p><p>E-1. Justification:  Sri Lanka has a small but </p><p>persistent problem of trafficking in children for </p><p>purposes of labor and sexual exploitation.  Since June </p><p>1999, the NCPA has been charged with bringing to the </p><p>police\'s attention instances of trafficking and other </p><p>abuses relating to children and to act in an advisory </p><p>position to the apprise the GSL of additional </p><p>legislation that is required.  The NCPA is in the </p><p>forefront of the GSL\'s efforts to prevent trafficking of </p><p>children in Sri Lanka.  In October 2002, the NCPA was </p><p>strengthen by the addition of a 14 person police unit </p><p>specifically tasked to assist the NCPA in its </p><p>investigations of those involved in trafficking and </p><p>other abuses against children.  With the ongoing peace </p><p>process, police are transferring from front-line </p><p>positions in Sri Lanka\'s fight against the Liberation </p><p>Tigers of Tamil Eelam to more traditional police roles. </p><p>This is not an easy transition.  This program will help </p><p>form the foundation for the relationship between the </p><p>civil and police authorities involved in combating </p><p>trafficking in children.  The USG will thus be </p><p>instrumental in insuring the development of a </p><p>professional and responsive anti-trafficking in persons </p><p>unit. </p><p> </p><p>E-2.  This program further develops the assistance that </p><p>the USG has already provided to the NCPA and lays the </p><p>foundation for future cooperation.  The USG has supplied </p><p>the NCPA with equipment in the past and has seen the </p><p>equipment used effectively in arresting those abusing </p><p>children. </p><p> </p><p>F. Performance Measures:  The NCPA has been involved in </p><p>investigations leading to the arrest for trafficking in </p><p>children, particularly in regards to sexual </p><p>exploitation, but the arrests are few and far between. </p><p>Performance Measures will include increased arrests and </p><p>successful prosecutions, and more hopefully a measurable </p><p>decline in the amount of children trafficked.  Mission </p><p>will review these issues through regular contact with </p><p>the NCPA, the police, and (I)NGOs focusing on the issue. </p><p> </p><p>G. Budget breakout: </p><p>Assessment phase:  USD 20,000 </p><p>Equipment purchase:  USD 30-50,000 (based on assessment) </p><p>Establishing inprocessing/training program:  USD 100,000 </p><p> </p><p>H. Host government contribution:  The NCPA and the </p><p>attached police unit is funded by the GSL. </p><p> </p><p>I. Other donor contribution:  Other donors have </p><p>contributed and continue to contribute to the work of </p><p>the NCPA.  The USG has provided equipment in the past. </p><p>This program will be outside of the current scope of </p><p>assistance being given to the NCPA. </p><p> </p><p>J. Funding Mechanism:  Funding for the program will be </p><p>directly between the USG and GSL. </p><p> </p><p>K. Point Of Contact:  Jason Wemhoener-Cuite, Political </p><p>Officer,  phone:  940-1-448-007 x2425. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
