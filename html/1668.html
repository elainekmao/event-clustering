Jeter; Reasons 1.5 (b) </p><p>and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY. During a post-Operation FOCUS RELIEF (OFR) </p><p>round-table meeting with the Nigerian National Security </p><p>Advisor (ref C), NSA Aliyu Mohammed also discussed </p><p>continental issues and President Obasanjo,s travel schedule. </p><p> He said President Obasanjo would travel to Asia in late May, </p><p>and would be back in Abuja only briefly on May 29 for </p><p>celebrations of the second anniversary of his inauguration </p><p>and Nigeria,s transition to democracy.  Mohammed noted that </p><p>President Kabila had been to Abuja, and would attend the </p><p>HIV/AIDS Summit immediately followed by an official visit </p><p>(This did not happen).  On Sudan, Mohammed said President </p><p>Bashir would offer John Garang autonomy for southern Sudan </p><p>but with unfavorable terms.  Egypt and Libya continued to </p><p>demonstrate deep interest and concern for the changing </p><p>Sudanese landscape.  On Niger and Chad, Nigeria recently </p><p>concluded an agreement with Chad and Niger for Nigerian </p><p>forces to stabilize the area around Lake Chad.  Nigeria is no </p><p>longer planning additional food aid for Niger, believing it </p><p>qualifies for broader international assistance.  Finally, </p><p>Libya continues to pressure Niger on loans taken by the Bare </p><p>regime, which used territory as collateral.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Following the OFR round-table on April 19, Ambassador </p><p>Jeter, DOD PDAS Bernd McConnell, AF PDAS Mark Bellamy, DATT, </p><p>and Counselor for Regional Affairs called on National </p><p>Security Advisor General (ret) Aliyu Mohammed.  The NSA was </p><p>joined by his principal assistant LTC Mohammed Inua Idris. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) In response to a series of questions from Ambassador </p><p>Jeter, the NSA noted that Democratic Republic of Congo </p><p>President Kabila had recently visited Nigeria.  (COMMENT: We </p><p>understand that President Obasanjo traveled to the </p><p>Presidential Wing of the Abuja airport to meet with President </p><p>Kabila.  END COMMENT.)  He said Kabila was seeking Nigerian </p><p>food assistance, but did not say whether Nigeria had agreed </p><p>to provide it. Kabila would also attend the HIV/AIDS Summit </p><p>and would remain afterward for an official visit to Nigeria </p><p>(Kabila was a no-show and Congo was not represented).  The </p><p>NSA, however, did state that the Nigerian Government was no </p><p>longer planning to purchase food aid for Niger, as he </p><p>understood that Niger was eligible to receive U.S. food </p><p>assistance itself.  (COMMENT:  We understand that the </p><p>Department has verified that there is a serious drought and </p><p>food shortage in Niger, and a request has been made to the </p><p>U.S. for PL 480 assistance.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The NSA noted that President Obasanjo would make an </p><p>official visit to Japan in late May, and then go on to </p><p>Indonesia for a G-15 conference.  He would return to Nigeria </p><p>on May 29 in order to participate in the ceremonies </p><p>celebrating the May 29, 1999 inauguration of a democratically </p><p>elected government.  He would then depart later the same day </p><p>to participate in celebrations for the founding of the CNN </p><p>television network to which he has been invited by CNN </p><p>President Ted Turner. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) The NSA then went on to discuss a number of other </p><p>continental issues.  He noted that based on discussions </p><p>between the Sudanese and the Kenyans, he believed Sudanese </p><p>President Bashir would offer John Garang autonomy for </p><p>southern Sudan but with terms that would not be acceptable to </p><p>Garang.  It would not be easy for Garang to get control over </p><p>the southern Sudanese oilfields, or to demarcate boundaries </p><p>through the swamps in the south.  The NSA also noted that the </p><p>Libyans and the Egyptians were talking with Sudanese </p><p>President Bashir regarding their concerns about southern </p><p>Sudanese autonomy.  The Egyptians were particularly worried </p><p>about the prospect of an autonomous southern Sudan taking </p><p>steps to dam or otherwise impede the flow of the Nile, </p><p>Egypt,s most sensitive foreign policy issue.  There would be </p><p>no resolution of the Sudan situation without Egypt. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) The NSA further stated his belief that Sudanese </p><p>opposition leader El Turabi did not realize that at least 75 </p><p>percent of the Sudanese no longer supported him.  Ambassador </p><p>Jeter told the NSA that U.S. Congressman Mike McNulty was </p><p>very interested in Sudanese matters, and the Congressman had </p><p>emphasized during a meeting with President Obasanjo that the </p><p>SPLA and Garang would have to be engaged to reach a </p><p>resolution to the conflict (Ref D).  He added that there was </p><p>great interest in the Sudan among religious and other groups </p><p>in the United States, including a wide array of Congressional </p><p>leaders. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) The NSA then said the pressure of drought in southern </p><p>Niger and in Chad was making the area around Lake Chad more </p><p>unstable.  Nigeria recently reached an agreement with Chad </p><p>and Niger for Nigerian forces to try to stabilize the area. </p><p>He also noted that Libyan leader Qadhafi continued to be </p><p>interested in the situation in Chad and that Chadian </p><p>President Idris Deby would travel to Tripoli to meet with </p><p>Qadhafi to discuss relations.  The NSA stated that Libyan </p><p>pressure on the Nigerien Government, particularly regarding </p><p>loans that had been made during the Bare regime that had used </p><p>Nigerien territory as collateral, had been increasing. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) In a brief reference to Burkina Faso, the NSA noted </p><p>that it too was interested in receiving some sort of food </p><p>assistance from Nigeria.  He mentioned that there would be an </p><p>upcoming meeting between President Obasanjo and President </p><p>Campaore, implying that Obasanjo might visit Ouagadougou in </p><p>the very near future. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
