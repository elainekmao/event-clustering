<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 TEGUCIGALPA 002829 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EB/OIA, INR/B, WHA/CEN, WHA/PPC, WHA/EX </p><p> </p><p>LABOR FOR ILAB, ROBERT WHOLEY </p><p> </p><p>STATE PLEASE PASS TO USAID FOR LAC/AA, USTR, EXIM, OPIC, </p><p>USED IDB, USED WB, USED IMF </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EINV, EAID, EAGR, PGOV, AMGT, HO </p><p>SUBJECT: NEW LAND CASE IN ROATAN GOOD TEST FOR GOH RESOLVE </p><p> </p><p>REF: Tegucigalpa 01756 </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary. American citizens Jean and Roger Moore </p><p>were suddenly and forcefully evicted from their Roatan home </p><p>in August of this year when the Melvyn McNab family </p><p>presented (and local judicial officials accepted) </p><p>unsubstantiated arguments that they had claim to this land. </p><p>A recently done cadastral survey by the GOH indicates that </p><p>the McNab claims are not true.  President Maduro, Supreme </p><p>Court President Vilma Morales, land registry officials and </p><p>local government representatives in the islands are all </p><p>aware of this case.  The Supreme Court has brought the case </p><p>to Tegucigalpa to investigate for irregularities.  The </p><p>Embassy believes the dispute represents an important test of </p><p>the GOH\'s professed interest in improving legal protections </p><p>for investors and positioning the Bay Islands for increased </p><p>investment and tourism.   End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) The Moores, and several other Americans, purchased </p><p>their beachfront lots in Paya Bay on the island of Roatan </p><p>from Amcit Eric Anderson in 1994; the property that he </p><p>subdivided is known in the land registry as plat number </p><p>306002.  He had full title to the land.  Anderson also has </p><p>an adjacent property, Plat 306001; it is this adjacent </p><p>property, purchased in the 1960s in the name of another </p><p>Honduran islander (at that time expats were not allowed to </p><p>own land near the coast) that has been the source of a </p><p>property dispute with Melvyn McNab since 1996.  This year, </p><p>however, McNab has expanded the dispute by providing to the </p><p>courts a redrawn map that changes the shape and location of </p><p>the disputed property (306001) to include the lots Anderson </p><p>sold to the Moores, Meyers and other Amcits.  The official </p><p>cadastral survey of the islands, just completed this summer, </p><p>clearly shows that the Moores\' land is located in plat </p><p>number 306002. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) On August 28th of this year, Jean Moore sent a fax </p><p>to the Embassy describing their forceful eviction on August </p><p>22nd from their home on the island of Roatan, Honduras. </p><p>According to the Moores, on August 9th, they received a </p><p>phone call from their caretaker who had been physically </p><p>removed in handcuffs from the house.  Judge Casco took </p><p>possession of all house keys from the caretaker.  The McNab </p><p>family then placed guards around the Moore\'s house and </p><p>property.  The Moore\'s arrived on Roatan on the 17th and </p><p>were denied access to their house.  Their attorney filed a </p><p>petition for an appeal for relief under the Honduran </p><p>Constitution, an amparo, to stop the eviction act.  The </p><p>petition was denied.  In the following days the Moores and </p><p>their attorneys tried to demonstrate their clear title over </p><p>the land and convince the judge to overturn his ruling, </p><p>without success.  On the 22nd, the Moores were told to </p><p>follow the police to their property.  The McNab family, </p><p>several police officers, including the Chief of Police, and </p><p>the McNab\'s attorney were all present as the Moores were </p><p>forced to remove all their personal belongings from their </p><p>property in a 2 hour time period.  They were not allowed to </p><p>lock the house and had to leave several items behind.  The </p><p>Moores report that there is already a family of six living </p><p>in the Moore house and some of their property has been </p><p>damaged. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Econoffs put the Moores in touch with Octavio </p><p>Sanchez, a legal advisor to the President, and Henry </p><p>Merriam, coordinator of a GOH program to complete cadastral </p><p>surveys and unify the land registries throughout Honduras. </p><p>They arranged to have a copy of the official survey of this </p><p>part of Roatan prepared.  The catastral survey appears to </p><p>fully support the American citizens\' assertion that the </p><p>Honduran party has no legal grounds for their claim to the </p><p>Moore\'s property. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) On September 11th the Embassy sent a letter signed </p><p>by the Charg d\'Affaires, Roger Pierce, to President Maduro </p><p>and Honduran Supreme Court (CSJ) President, Vilma Morales </p><p>with copies to Investment Minister, Camilo Atala, Tourism </p><p>Minister, Thierre Pierrefeu, and Cesar Batres, Godofredo </p><p>Alvarado and Octavio Sanchez, legal advisors to President </p><p>Maduro, stating the Embassy\'s concern about this case and </p><p>the apparent disregard of investor rights.  Econoffs visited </p><p>Roatan on September 26-29 to emphasize the importance of </p><p>fair treatment of Amcit investors in general, and quick </p><p>resolution of the Moore dispute in particular, in </p><p>conversations with the Governor, municipal authorities, </p><p>judicial authorities and the local land registry </p><p>representative.  We also met with the director of the IDB- </p><p>funded Tourism Ministry project that performed the usd 1.5 </p><p>million cadastral survey and urged rapid integration of the </p><p>cadastral results with the existing land registry. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Partially as a result of Embassy advocacy, the </p><p>Moore case has received rare high-level attention in the </p><p>GOH.  We are aware that President Maduro, CSJ President </p><p>Morales and the Minister of Interior (Gobernacion y </p><p>Justicia) have discussed the case.  Supreme Court President </p><p>Morales instructed the court in La Ceiba to send the case to </p><p>the Tegucigalpa courts to be reviewed for judicial </p><p>irregularities.  CSJ President Morales told econoff on </p><p>October 2 that the review will occur quickly and that she </p><p>will notify the Embassy of the results of the review. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>Background on the Legal Issues in the Dispute </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) Background: In the 1960\'s, Roy Anderson bought a </p><p>15-acre parcel of land in Wilkes Point, plat number 306001. </p><p>At that time, U.S. citizens weren\'t allowed to purchase land </p><p>so Mr. Anderson bought the property from the McLaughlin </p><p>family using a Honduran woman named Merly Cooper and </p><p>registered it under their company name, Calico S.A. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) In 1974, Roy Anderson purchased a second parcel of </p><p>land totaling 17 acres directly from the McLaughlin family, </p><p>as the law now allowed foreigners to own coastal land under </p><p>certain conditions (small private investor, tourism, etc.) </p><p>This second parcel is adjacent to the first, and is located </p><p>in Wilkes Point West - with plat number 306002.  In 1994, </p><p>Roger and Jean Moore purchased two lots from Erik Anderson </p><p>(Roy Anderson\'s son) on parcel 306002. </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) Mervin and Lurlene Cooper de McNab own land </p><p>adjacent to Wilkes Point West called Paya Bay.  Lurlene </p><p>McNab\'s maiden name is Cooper.  The McNab\'s are claiming </p><p>that Lurlene is the sole heiress to the deceased Merle </p><p>Cooper\'s land, however Merle Cooper never married and had no </p><p>children, therefore has no heirs.  The inheritance battle is </p><p>over parcel 306001 (the 15 acres purchased through Merle </p><p>Cooper.)  The Moore property is on parcel 306002.  However, </p><p>Mervin McNab pulled up all the fence lines and survey </p><p>markers between the two properties that runs North to South </p><p>and re-drew the map to show that the 15 acres runs East to </p><p>West along the coast cutting through both parcels (map faxed </p><p>to desk).  The official Government survey that was recently </p><p>completed using GPS, satellite tracking, and topographical </p><p>surveys clearly shows the delineation of the two parcels, </p><p>with no depiction of the McNab redrawn parcel. </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) We understand from judicial authorities that under </p><p>Honduran law the Moores\' property should not have been </p><p>subject to the confiscation because they are not a party to </p><p>the underlying dispute.  And, in fact, when the Moores first </p><p>appealed to the judge to rescind the eviction order, the </p><p>judge agreed, noting the Moores\' name did not appear on the </p><p>court documents.  Rather Erik Anderson was the defendant for </p><p>a 15-acre parcel in Wilkes Point.  However, when the Moores </p><p>went to the police station to pick up their keys, the judge </p><p>had changed his decision, and the eviction order was </p><p>enforced.  The Moores believe the McNab\'s attorney, through </p><p>her political connections, was responsible for the change in </p><p>the judge\'s decision. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU) We consider this an important test case for the </p><p>GOH\'s resolve to attack the endemic problems of land title </p><p>and abuse of the judicial system.  The Bay Islands have a </p><p>history of problems of this type, but the new cadastral </p><p>survey and the proposed land registry project together </p><p>provide the government and court system with an important </p><p>set of tools.  We are hoping that the political will exists </p><p>to ensure that a rapid and just resolution for the Moores\' </p><p>case (and the other Amcits who purchased property from Eric </p><p>Anderson) can be found.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>PALMER </p><p></p></div>
