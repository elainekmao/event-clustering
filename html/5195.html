<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 000113 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FOR IO AND AF </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/17/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PREL, LY, NI, UNHRC-1 </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: LIBYAN CHAIR </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) State 5849 </p><p>-    (B) 02 Abuja 3310 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by DCM Andrews: Reason: 1.5(d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary: Nigerian President Obasanjo reportedly is </p><p>making telephone calls in an effort to replace Libya with </p><p>Mozambique as the Africa Group\'s candidate to chair the 2003 </p><p>CHR session.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) DCM Andrews delivered ref A demarche by phone to </p><p>Presidential International Affairs Advisor Ad\'Obe Obe the </p><p>morning of January 17.  An appointment had been scheduled, </p><p>but Obe telephoned to say the President had called him. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) While a poor connection and Obe\'s short fuse for </p><p>seeing the President precluded making the entire demarche, </p><p>all key points got across.  DCM put particular emphasis on </p><p>Libya\'s violation of the human rights of Nigerian citizens. </p><p>Obe undertook to raise the issue with Obasanjo. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Obe contacted us in the this afternoon after talking </p><p>to Obasanjo.  Obe said the President would contact the AU </p><p>Chairman to see if Mozambique (the next AU Chairman) might </p><p>replace Libya.  Obe hoped to provide us further "feedback" </p><p>on Obasanjo\'s efforts later in the day. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) COMENT: We believe that the GON has never been happy </p><p>with the prospect of a Libyan CHR Chair (see also ref B), </p><p>but Foreign Minister Sule Lamido attended the Ministerial, </p><p>and he may not have resisted as strongly as Obasanjo would </p><p>have liked.  Libya\'s announcement that it planned to </p><p>execute a Nigerian citizen raised Tripoli\'s "negatives" in </p><p>Nigeria this week; Nigerian Deputy FM Onyia called in the </p><p>Libyan Ambassador to protest.  The execution was supposed </p><p>to take place this morning.  Apparently, it has been </p><p>rescheduled for January 18 (tomorrow).  If this sentence is </p><p>carried out as now scheduled, we can anticipate a </p><p>reasonably vigorous effort by Obasanjo and the GON to stop </p><p>Libya from assuming the chair. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
