TOKYO 1194 </p><p>     D. 02 RANGOON 1447 </p><p>     E. 02 RANGOON 1366 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: COM CARMEN MARTINEZ FOR REASONS 1.5 (B,D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: The new Japanese "Three Pillars" strategy of </p><p>humanitarian aid, economic reform, and democracy was </p><p>officially unveiled on April 29.  The Japanese ambassador in </p><p>Rangoon explained the details and origin of this policy to </p><p>the Chief of Mission (COM) during a lunch on May 5.  Though </p><p>he did not expect U.S. support, the ambassador asked for U.S. </p><p>understanding and pointed out how the U.S. and Japan </p><p>strategies might be complementary in achieving democratic </p><p>reform.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>The Three Pillars Strategy </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) During a lunch at his residence on May 5, Ambassador </p><p>Miyamoto gave a readout to the COM, DCM, and Economic Officer </p><p>(notetaker) on the recent visit to Rangoon of former Prime </p><p>Minister Yoshio Mori.  Mori visited April 29-May 2 on behalf </p><p>of two private Japanese foundations.  The ambassador stressed </p><p>that Mori was not an envoy of the Japanese government. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The former prime minister met with the SPDC leader, </p><p>Senior General Than Shwe, and delivered to him a letter from </p><p>current Japanese PM Junichiro Koizumi explaining the new </p><p>Japanese "Three Pillars" strategy for relations with Burma. </p><p>This policy, which the Japanese government described in </p><p>detail at the February Informal Consultative Group on Burma </p><p>meeting (Ref C) is founded on the concept of "total </p><p>engagement" with the Burmese regime; engaging on humanitarian </p><p>aid, economic reform, and progress toward democracy. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The ambassador clarified the reasoning behind this </p><p>definitive Japanese policy shift.  He characterized Japan\'s </p><p>recent Burma policy as fickle and rootless, changing with the </p><p>political winds.  These vagaries had eroded the traditional </p><p>trust and influence that Japan felt it had with the regime </p><p>and the Burmese people, adding that the Burmese people had a </p><p>"warm place in their heart for the Japanese."  The ambassador </p><p>said that upon arriving in the summer of 2002, he began to </p><p>examine the situation on the ground to see how the Japanese </p><p>might reassert themselves.  His conclusion was that the </p><p>Japanese government should rebuild its foundation of trust </p><p>with the Burmese regime through 360-degree engagement.  He </p><p>contrasted this with the Chinese and ASEAN engagement </p><p>policies that provide assistance without pushing for </p><p>political or economic reforms, and with the U.S. and European </p><p>policies that rely on sanctions and pressure for reform with </p><p>no assistance. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) The new policy is ambitious and, the ambassador </p><p>admitted, quite risky.  However, the ambassador opined that </p><p>something new was needed to break the current impasse, and </p><p>thus it was worth a try.  He was unable to respond, though, </p><p>to the COM\'s questions regarding the specific measurements </p><p>of, or a timetable for, the policy\'s success or failure.  He </p><p>would only say that success would be measured in </p><p>(unspecified) political reform.  Later in the meeting, the </p><p>ambassador, who clearly has a large personal stake in the </p><p>policy\'s success, indicated that a personal goal for him </p><p>would be substantial progress within a five-year time frame, </p><p>though again it was unclear what exactly the endgame was. </p><p>The new Japanese policy will have no conditionality, nor will </p><p>it receive a large budget for implementation.  Instead, </p><p>proposed projects would be approved for funding by Tokyo on a </p><p>case by case basis. </p><p> </p><p>Trust But Verify </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Miyamoto stressed that at this point the strategy is </p><p>focused only on rebuilding trust and relations with SPDC </p><p>decisionmakers.  He pointed out his aim to gain easier access </p><p>to SPDC Secretary One, General Khin Nyunt, and the frank </p><p>exchange of views between ex-PM Mori and Senior General Than </p><p>Shwe.  When the COM asked how the Japanese would ensure that </p><p>messages about political and economic reform would get </p><p>through to the top, the ambassador quickly replied that if </p><p>this problem arose PM Mori (or another senior envoy) could </p><p>return to deliver the message personally.  According to </p><p>Ambassador Miyamoto, PM Mori had invited Senior General Than </p><p>Shwe to spend two or three days in Tokyo as "his guest" </p><p>following Japan-ASEAN meetings coming up in December. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) The ambassador claimed that if he had closer ties with </p><p>Burmese leaders he would be able to read their intentions, </p><p>and that their close ties would keep the SPDC honest.  He </p><p>said that the Burmese government would respond better to </p><p>earnest requests for necessary changes from a government with </p><p>whom it has good personal ties, than to demands and pressure </p><p>from hostile governments.  The COM was skeptical of the </p><p>Japanese reliance on trust and goodwill as the basis for the </p><p>policy\'s success. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) If the relationships are established, the Japanese </p><p>will push forward with their specific objectives.  The UN\'s </p><p>overdue humanitarian assessment was mentioned as a possible </p><p>benchmark for basic human needs assistance, while the </p><p>long-awaited Japan-Burma economic structural adjustment </p><p>review would be the economic starting point.  It was less </p><p>clear what the Japanese had in mind for an opening gambit on </p><p>the political side.  However, the Ambassador said he would </p><p>use his hoped-for new relationships to push the SPDC to give </p><p>increased importance to the visits of UN Envoys Razali and </p><p>Pinheiro. </p><p> </p><p>Don\'t Stand in the Way </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) The overall message, diplomatically conveyed, was that </p><p>the Japanese were going to try a bold new policy, and while </p><p>they didn\'t expect U.S. support, they hoped that the United </p><p>States would not object.  Ambassador Miyamoto told the COM at </p><p>least twice that he thought the United States and Japan could </p><p>work together with complementary policies aimed at the same </p><p>objective -- democracy in Burma.  We are not yet 100 percent </p><p>convinced that Japan\'s intention is as wholeheartedly </p><p>democratic as the ambassador claimed.  Although it could be </p><p>helpful to have a close ally, who at least professes to be in </p><p>favor of democratic reform, with good access to Senior </p><p>General Than Shwe, we remain skeptical that the regime </p><p>understands that the goal of the Japanese policy is political </p><p>reform and transition to democracy. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
