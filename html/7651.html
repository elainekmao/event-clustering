ROME 1660 </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  01754  01 OF 02  242323Z </p><p>     B. ROME 1701 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: A/DCM TOM COUNTRYMAN FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  THE ITALIAN MFA, WHICH NOMINALLY HAS THE LEAD ON </p><p>ITALY\'S HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE EFFORTS IN IRAQ, IS SEEKING </p><p>TO DEPLOY IMMEDIATELY A 27-BED ICRC FIELD HOSPITAL TO BAGHDAD </p><p>(REF A).  AMBASSADOR BADINI, DIRECTOR OF THE GOI\'S IRAQ TASK </p><p>FORCE, TOLD A/DCM ON APRIL 24 THAT ITALY REQUESTED </p><p>AUTHORIZATION TO FLY AN ANTONOV AIRCRAFT CARRYING HOSPITAL </p><p>EQUIPMENT INTO BAGHDAD ON APRIL 28. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) A/DCM TOLD BADINI THAT BAGHDAD AIRPORT WAS NOT OPEN </p><p>FOR BUSINESS.  CENTCOM HAD INFORMED THE EMBASSY THAT AIR </p><p>TRANSPORT WAS NOT A FEASIBLE OPTION FOR THE TIME BEING. </p><p>A/DCM SUGGESTED THAT THE MFA CONSIDER MOVING THE HOSPITAL IN </p><p>THROUGH KUWAIT OR AMMAN.  EITHER ARRANGEMENTS FOR OVERLAND </p><p>TRAVEL WOULD HAVE TO BE MADE OR THE GOI\'S TASK FORCE COULD </p><p>WAIT UNTIL BAGHDAD AIRPORT WAS UP AND RUNNING.  BADINI </p><p>OBJECTED THAT ITALY DID NOT HAVE ANY VEHICLES POSITIONED IN </p><p>EITHER KUWAIT OR JORDAN TO DO THE JOB.  EXPRESSING SOME </p><p>DEGREE OF FRUSTRATION, HE SAID THAT IF THE USG ULTIMATELY DID </p><p>NOT WANT THE HOSPITAL IN BAGHDAD, THE TASK FORCE WOULD NOT </p><p>SEND IT TO ANOTHER LOCATION IN IRAQ. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) A/DCM REITERATED THAT THE GOI\'S NUMBER ONE PRIORITY </p><p>SHOULD BE WORKING ITS EFFORTS TO DEPLOY A FIELD HOSPITAL </p><p>THROUGH THE CENTCOM PLANNING CELL -- SPECIFICALLY VIA THE </p><p>ITALIAN LNO, GENERAL SANTINI.  WITHOUT CENTCOM APPROVAL, IT </p><p>WAS SIMPLY NOT POSSIBLE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH WORKING THE </p><p>OPERATIONAL DETAILS NECESSSARY TO REALIZE THE PROJECT. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01754  01 OF 02  242323Z </p><p>BADINI STATED THAT AN MFA SITE SURVEY TEAM CURRENTLY IN </p><p>BAGHDAD HAD RECEIVED A GREEN LIGHT TO DEPLOY THE HOSPITAL IN </p><p>BAGHDAD FROM GENERAL BLOUNT.  A/DCM URGED BADINI TO RELAY </p><p>THIS INFORMATION TO SANTINI, SO THAT PLANNING CELLS IN TAMPA </p><p>COULD GIVE BLOUNT\'S STATEMENTS FULL WEIGHT IN THEIR DECISION </p><p>ON LOCATION OF THE HOSPITAL.  BADINI COMPLAINED THAT THE LNO </p><p>CHANNEL WAS BROKEN AND THEREFORE HE LACKED CONFIDENCE IN IT. </p><p>A/DCM AGREED THE CHANNEL WASN\'T WORKING, BUT SAID THE ONLY </p><p>OPTION WAS TO FIX IT, NOT CIRCUMVENT IT. </p><p> </p><p>EMBASSY COMMENT </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) EMBASSY HAS DEVOTED THE LAST SEVERAL DAYS TO GETTING </p><p>THE MINISTRIES OF DEFENSE AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS TO GIVE GEN. </p><p>SANTINI MORE INFORMATION AND AUTHORITY TO ADDRESS NOT ONLY </p><p>PURELY MILITARY BUT ALSO THE HUMANITARIAN DEPLOYMENTS INTO </p><p>IRAQ.  OUR EFFORTS MAY BE PAYING OFF.  LATE APRIL 24, MINDEF </p><p>MARTINO\'S DIPLOMATIC ADVISER TOLD A/DCM THAT MOD HAD JUST </p><p>REACHED AGREEMENT WITH AMB. BADINI THAT MFA WOULD TRANSMIT </p><p>FULL OPERATIONAL DETAILS ON THE HOSPITAL DEPLOYMENT TO THE </p><p>DEFENSE STAFF, WHICH WILL PASS IT ON TO SANTINI WITH ORDERS </p><p>TO WORK OUT ALL REMAINING DETAILS (I.E., NOT ONLY PURELY </p><p>MILITARY ASPECTS).  IN ADDITION, THE GOI WILL SEEK TO </p><p>DOUBLE-TRACK THE INFORMATION THROUGH AMB. ANTONIO ARMELLINI, </p><p>THEIR NEWLY APPOINTED LIAISON TO OHRA, WHO SHOULD BE IN </p><p>KUWAIT SHORTLY.  WE ARE NOW CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC THAT </p><p>CENTCOM PLANNERS WILL SEE SOON A MORE INFORMED AND </p><p>FORTHCOMING GEN. SANTINI. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) THE EMBASSY IS FULLY AWARE OF AND GREATLY APPRECIATES </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01754  01 OF 02  242323Z </p><p>CENTCOM\'S EFFORTS TO FACILITATE AND EXPEDITE HUMANITARIAN </p><p>ASSISTANCE TO THE IRAQI PEOPLE THAT ITALY AND OTHER COUNTRIES </p><p>ARE TRYING TO MAKE AVAILABLE.  IT IS A DIFFICULT TASK MADE </p><p>MORE COMPLICATED WHEN COUNTRIES DO NOT FOLLOW ESTABLISHED </p><p>PROCEDURES.  NEVERTHELESS, WE ARE ALSO CONVINCED THAT ITALY </p><p>IS TRYING TO DO THE RIGHT THING, AND THEREFORE WANT TO </p><p>UNDERSCORE THREE REASONS WHY IT MAKES SENSE TO ALLOW THE GOI </p><p>TO DEPLOY THEIR HOSPITAL IN BAGHDAD, EVEN IF THE LOCATION </p><p>IDENTIFIED BY THE GOI IS NOT THE AREA WHERE THE HOSPITAL IS </p><p>MOST URGENTLY NEEDED. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) THE GOI CHOSE THE LOCATION BETWEEN THE AL NOUMAN </p><p>GENERAL HOSPITAL AND THE KHEDIMIA PEDIATRIC HOSPITAL (NEAR </p><p>SADDAM CITY) BECAUSE IT HAS PRIOR EXPERIENCE WORKING WITH </p><p>THOSE HEALTH FACILITIES (REF A).  SITING A FIELD HOSPITAL </p><p>THERE OPENS THE WAY FOR ITALY TO REESTABLISH A LONG-TERM </p><p>"SPONSORING" RELATIONSHIP WITH THE TWO PERMANENT HOSPITALS </p><p>WHICH WILL PERSIST AFTER ITS TEMPORARY FACILITY IS REMOVED. </p><p>MOREOVER, AS WE STRESSED IN REF B, HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE </p><p>PROVIDES THE GOI WITH JUSTIFICATION FOR PUTTING ITS PROPOSED </p><p>1700-2000 BOOTS ON THE GROUND TO DO PHASE IV PEACEKEEPING AND </p><p>MSU-TYPE WORK.
