CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY AND INTRODUCTION.  FOLLOWING MAJOR </p><p>FIGHTING ON THE NIGHT OF APRIL 16-17, A TENSE CALM </p><p>NOW PREVAILS IN WEST BEIRUT.  SHIITE AMAL MOVEMENT </p><p>LEADER NABIH BARRI EMERGED AS THE PRIME VICTOR IN </p><p>THE INTRAMUSLIM FIGHTING.  STATEMENTS MADE BY THE </p><p>VARIOUS LEADERS TRACK WITH OUR ANALYSIS (REFTEL A) </p><p>THAT THE FIGHTING REFLECTED TWO MAJOR CONFLICTS: </p><p>LEBANESE SHIA VS. LEBANESE SUNNI AND LEBANESE SHIA </p><p>VS. PALESTINIANS.  THE AMAL MOVEMENT, WITH THE </p><p>SUPPORT OF THE DRUZE PSP AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE </p><p>"NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC FRONT," HAS DEALT A SEVERE </p><p>BLOW TO THE SUNNI MURABITUN MILITIA AND HAS COME </p><p>OUT OF THE AFFAIR WITH ITS POSITION AS THE </p><p>STRONGEST POLITICAL AND MILITARY FORCE IN WEST </p><p>BEIRUT CONFIRMED AND ENHANCED. </p><p> </p><p>3.  THE SYRIAN ROLE REMAINS UNCLEAR, BUT MANY HERE </p><p>SPECULATE THAT DAMASCUS MUST HAVE CONDONED THE </p><p>AMAL/PSP MOVE AGAINST THE MURABITUN AND ITS </p><p>PRO-ARAFAT PALESTINIAN ALLIES AND MAY HAVE, IN </p><p>FACT, ACTIVELY SUPPORTED THE CLASH. </p><p> </p><p>4.  IN HIS RESIGNATION STATEMENT, PRIME MINISTER </p><p>RASHID KARAMI EXPRESSED DESPAIR OVER THE APRIL </p><p>16-17 FIGHTING, POINTED AN ACCUSING FIGURE AT </p><p>DAMASCUS, AND ASKED FOR SYRIA TO HELP RESOLVE THE </p><p>ENSUING CRISIS.  IT IS TOO SOON TO MAKE ANY FIRM </p><p>PREDICTIONS AS TO WHO THE NEXT PRIME MINISTER MAY </p><p>BE OR WHAT FORM THE NEW CABINET MAY TAKE, BUT WE </p><p>SET FORTH BELOW SOME OF THE RELEVANT FACTORS.  END </p><p>SUMMARY AND INTRODUCTION. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>AMAL, BACKED BY PSP, VICTORIOUS </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>5.  THE DUST IS NOW SETTLING IN WEST BEIRUT AFTER </p><p>VERY HEAVY FIGHTING OCCURRED ON THE NIGHT OF APRIL </p><p>16-17, RESULTING IN APPROXIMATELY THIRTY PERSONS </p><p>KILLED AND ONE HUNDRED WOUNDED.  BEIRUT AIRPORT </p><p>REMAINS OPERATIONAL, AND THE GREEN LINE IS </p><p>PARTIALLY OPEN, BUT SPORADIC SNIPING CONTINUES IN </p><p>VARIOUS AREAS OF WEST BEIRUT. </p><p> </p><p>6.  IN THE FIRST INSTANCE, STATEMENTS BY KEY </p><p>LEADERS CONFIRMED OUR EARLIER ANALYSIS THAT THE </p><p>EVENTS OF APRIL 16-17 REFLECTED A SHIA-SUNNI </p><p>CONFLICT.  THE SHIITE AMAL MILITIA, BACKED BY THE </p><p>DRUZE PSP, HIT HARD AT THE SUNNI MURABITUN MILITIA, </p><p>REPORTEDLY TAKING CONTROL OF ALL SIGNIFICANT </p><p>MURABITUN POSITIONS, INCLUDING THE "VOICE OF ARAB </p><p>LEBANON" RADIO STATION LOCATED IN THE ABDUL NASR </p><p>MOSQUE. </p><p> </p><p>7.  THE REACTION OF SUNNI LEADERS HAS BEEN STRONG. </p><p>PRIME MINISTER KARAMI RESIGNED (SEE BELOW), AND THE </p><p>GRAND MUFTI OF THE REPUBLIC, SHEIKH HASSAN KHALID, </p><p>STRONGLY CONDEMNED THE SHIA FOR STRIKING AGAINST </p><p>TRADITIONALLY SUNNI WEST BEIRUT.  "IT IS </p><p>INADMISSIBLE FOR BEIRUT TO BE STRUCK AND HUMILIATED </p><p>AND ITS AUTHORITY SEIZED BY THOSE VERY PEOPLE THAT </p><p>IT PROTECTED AND WILL CONTINUE TO PROTECT...BY </p><p>THOSE THAT IT WELCOMED AND HONORED AND WILL </p><p>CONTINUE TO WELCOME AND HONOR."  THE MUFTI ADDED </p><p>THAT THE SUNNIS WOULD NOT PERMIT THE INHABITANTS OF </p><p>WEST BEIRUT TO BE "STRUCK AS IF THEY HAD BECOME </p><p>ISRAELI AGENTS."  EXPRESSING SOLIDARITY WITH PRIME </p><p>MINISTER KARAMI, FORMER PM TAKIADDIN SOLH STRONGLY </p><p>REGRETTED THE FIGHTING WHICH "OPPOSED PARTIES </p><p>STRUGGLING FOR A COMMON CAUSE...WHO SHOULD DIRECT </p><p>THEIR WEAPONS EXCLUSIVELY AGAINST THE ISRAELI </p><p>ENEMY." </p><p> </p><p>8.  AMAL LEADER NABIH BARRI RESPONDED VEHEMENTLY TO </p><p>THE MUFTI\'S NOTION THAT THE SHIA WERE GUESTS IN </p><p>TRADITIONALLY SUNNI WEST BEIRUT.  "BEIRUT IS MY </p><p>CITY AND MY CAPTIAL," HE SAID, "WE WILL NOT ACCEPT </p><p>CANTONS THAT DEFINE US AS FOREIGNERS WHEN WE ARE </p><p>PEOPLE OF THE HOUSE."  SUPPORTING BARRI\'S </p><p>STATEMENT, THE DRUZE PSP SAID IT "COULD NOT </p><p>UNDERSTAND...HOW HE (THE MUFTI) COULD QUALIFY </p><p>CERTAIN RESIDENTS OF WEST BEIRUT (I.E., THE SHIA) </p><p>AS INTRUDERS. ...THOSE WHO DEFEND WITH THEIR BLOOD </p><p>THE CAPITAL AGAINST FASCIST-PHALANGE AGRESSION, </p><p>THOSE WHO STRUGGLE SO THAT BEIRUT WILL REMAIN ARAB </p><p>AND FREE CANNOT BE CALLED INTRUDERS." </p><p> </p><p>9.  IN THE SECOND INSTANCE, THE APRIL 16-17 </p><p>FIGHTING WAS A SHIA-PALESTINIAN SET-TO.  THE SHIA, </p><p>BACKED BY THE DRUZE, STRUCK HARD NOT ONLY AT THE </p><p>SUNNI MURABITUN BUT ALSO AT THE PRO-ARAFAT </p><p>PALESTINIANS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE </p><p>MURABITUN.  THEIR SUCCESS IN DOING SO, HOWEVER, WAS </p><p>LESS OVERWHELMING, IN PART BECAUSE THE PALESTINIANS </p><p>APPARENTLY DID NOT "RISE TO THE BAIT" AND </p><p>PARTICIPATE IN THE FIGHTING WITH ALL THEIR FORCE. </p><p>SINCE THE FIGHTING, AMAL AND PSP HAVE REPORTEDLY </p><p>ESTABLISHED CHECKPOINTS AROUND THE PALESTINIAN </p><p>REFUGEE CAMPS, TIGHTENING CONTROL OVER THE INFLUX </p><p>OF ARMS. </p><p> </p><p>10.  IN A MAJOR PUBLIC STATEMENT, AMAL HIT HARD AT </p><p>THE PALESTINIANS.  BARRI CALLED THE FIGHTING A </p><p>"NIGHTMARE" IN WHICH HIS AMAL MILITIA CONFRONTED </p><p>"AN UPRISING CAREFULLY PLANNED BY ARAB HANDS </p><p>EXPLOITING SECTARIAN IDEAS, FOREIGNERS, INTRUDERS, </p><p>AND GUESTS IN BEIRUT."  BARRI ASKED RHETORICALLY </p><p>"WHY SOME OUTSIDERS (I.E., THE PALESTINIANS) ARE </p><p>CONSIDERED AS GUESTS, EVEN IF THEY COME FROM </p><p>ANOTHER REGION AND ANOTHER CONFESSION, WHILE THE </p><p>REAL GUESTS IN BEIRUT (I.E., THE SHIA), WHO HAD THE </p><p>HONOR OF LIBERATING THE CITY FROM THE CHAINS OF MAY </p><p>17 AND THE AGENTS OF ISRAEL, ARE NOT WELL LOOKED </p><p>UPON..." </p><p> </p><p>11.  ON THE GROUND, THE VICTORS HAVE MOVED TO </p><p>CONSOLIDATE THEIR GAINS.  LEADERS OF AMAL, PSP, AND </p><p>THE SMALLER MEMBERS OF THE LEFTIST "NATIONAL </p><p>DEMOCRATIC FRONT" (SYRIAN SOCIALIST NATIONAL PARTY, </p><p>LEBANESE COMMUNIST PARTY, SYRIAN ARAB BAATH PARTY) </p><p>MET AT BARRI\'S WEST BEIRUT RESIDENCE ON APRIL 17 </p><p>AND ANNOUNCED THE FORMATION OF A UNIFIED MILITARY </p><p>COMMAND TO ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN ORDER IN WEST </p><p>BEIRUT (A THROW-BACK TO AN IDEA FIRST FIELDED AFTER </p><p>THE FEBRUARY 6, 1984, FIGHTING AND DROPPED AFTER </p><p>STIFF SUNNI RESISTANCE).  THIS GROUP PLANS TO SET </p><p>UP AN OPERATIONS ROOM AND A BUREAU OF CITIZENS </p><p>AFFAIRS.  IT SAYS IT WILL ALSO COMMAND A JOINT </p><p>"STRIKE FORCE" INITIALLY COMPRISING 300 MEN, TO BE </p><p>DOUBLED TO 600, DRAWN IN EQUAL NUMBERS FROM AMAL, </p><p>THE PSP, AND THE JUNIOR MEMBERS OF THE NDF. </p><p>ACCORDING TO THE BEIRUT DAILY, "LE REVEIL," WEST </p><p>BEIRUT NEIGHBORHOODS HAVE BEEN PARCELED OUT AMONG </p><p>THESE GROUPS.  AMAL IS REPORTEDLY RESPONSIBLE FOR </p><p>SECURITY IN TARIQ AL-JADIDAH, FAKAHANI, MAZRAH, AND </p><p>KARAKAS; THE PSP IN RAS BEIRUT, HAMRA, AYN </p><p>AL-MURAYSA, MINAT AL-HISN, MUSAYTIBAH, AND RAWSHAH; </p><p>AND THE VARIOUS SMALLER GROUPS UNDER THE EGIS OF </p><p>THE PSP IN SMALL, TOKEN  SECTIONS OF TERRITORY. </p><p> </p><p>12.  NOTABLY ABSENT FROM REPRESENTATION ON THE </p><p>UNIFIED MILITARY COMMAND OR IN THE DIVISION OF </p><p>SPOILS IS ANY SUNNI MUSLIM GROUP.  LACK OF GOL OR </p><p>LAF PARTICIPATION GOES WITHOUT SAYING.  MORE THAN </p><p>EVER BEFORE, NABIH BARRI HAS ESTABLISHED HIMSELF AS </p><p>THE STRONGMAN OF WEST BEIRUT.  THROUGH THE </p><p>FORMATION OF THE UNIFIED MILITARY COMMAND AND THE </p><p>ANNOUNCED FORMATION OF A "POLITICAL HIGH COMMAND," </p><p>THE SHIITE AMAL MOVEMENT WITH ITS ALLIES IS </p><p>CONSOLIDATING AND FORMALIZING ITS CONTROL OF WEST </p><p>BEIRUT.  THIS WILL BE A BITTER PILL FOR THE SUNNI </p><p>COMMUNITY TO SWALLOW. </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>SYRIAN ROLE </p><p>----------- </p><p>13.  THERE AS BEEN MUCH SPECULATION AND LITTLE </p><p>CONCRETE EVIDENCE CONCERNING THE ROLE THAT SYRIA </p><p>MAY HAVE PLAYED IN THE APRIL 16-17 FIGHTING.  AS WE </p><p>ANTICIPATED (REFTEL A), THE FACT THAT NABIH BARRI </p><p>HAD JUST RETURNED FROM DAMACUS BEFORE THE FIGHTING </p><p>HAS FUELED SPECULATION THAT SYRIA CONDONED AND </p><p>PERHAPS ACTIVELY SUPPORTED THE MOVE AGAINST THE </p><p>MURABITUN AND, ESPECIALLY, AGAINST THE PRO-ARAFAT </p><p>PALESTINIANS.  ACCORDING TO THIS LINE OF REASONING, </p><p>SYRIA MAY NEXT UNLEASH AMAL AND THE PSP AGAINST THE </p><p>PRO-ARAFAT PALESTINIANS IN THE BEIRUT SOUTHERN </p><p>SUBURBS AND IN SIDON.  IN ANY EVENT, SYRIA IS </p><p>CERTAINLY WATCHING DEVELOPMENTS HERE CLOSELY AND IS </p><p>APPARENTLY NOT UNHAPPY WITH THE COURSE THEY HAVE </p><p>TAKEN SO FAR. </p><p> </p><p>14.  IN HIS RESIGNATION STATEMENT (REFTEL B.), </p><p>PRIME MINISTER KARAMI EXPRESSED DEEP DESPAIR OVER </p><p>THE VIOLENCE IN WEST BEIRUT.  HE OBLIQUELY BUT </p><p>CLEARLY BLAMED SYRIA FOR THE "GRAVE AND SERIOUS" </p><p>EVENTS AND CALLED ON IT TO HELP SORT OUT THE </p><p>CRISIS.  ON APRIL 18, KARAMI DEPARTED FOR DAMASCUS </p><p>TO MEET WITH SARG LEADERS. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>REPLACING THE PRIME MINISTER </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>15.  THE IMMEDIATE CONSEQUENCE OF THIS LATEST </p><p>BATTLE IN WEST BEIRUT WAS TO FORCE THE RESIGNATION </p><p>OF PRIME MINISTER KARAMI WHO, CONFRONTED WITH </p><p>BARRI\'S SUCCESSFUL ATTACK ON SUNNI INTERESTS, HAD </p><p>NO CHOICE BUT TO RESIGN.  THE SELECTION OF A NEW </p><p>SUNNI PRIME MINISTER IS SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF </p><p>RESTRAINTS.  FOREMOST IS THE UNLIKELIHOOD OF ANY </p><p>SUNNI NOTABLE AGREEING TO REPLACE THE DESPAIRING </p><p>KARAMI UNDER THE PRESENT CONDITIONS.  KARAMI </p><p>CLEARLY FELT HUMILIATED BY THE EVENTS OF APRIL </p><p>16-17; NO SELF-RESPECTING SUNNI WOULD OVERTLY </p><p>ATTEMPT TO PROFIT BY THE "EFFENDI\'S" DISCOMFITURE. </p><p>SECONDLY, IT WILL BE DIFFICULT TO PERSUADE A SUNNI </p><p>LEADER TO PRESIDE OVER A CABINET WITH AN </p><p>UNREPENTANT BARRI AND JUMBLATT PRESENT.  FINALLY, </p><p>SYRIA\'S APPROVAL OF THE NEW PRIME MINISTER WILL BE </p><p>REQUIRED.  NOT KNOWING SYRIA\'S EXACT ROLE AND </p><p>INTENTIONS IN THE EVENTS IN THE WEST, THE </p><p>PROSPECTIVE SUNNI CANDIDATES WILL BE WARY. </p><p> </p><p>16.  UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, WE CAN FORESEE ONE </p><p>FORM WHICH A POSSIBLE SOLUTION MIGHT TAKE.  FOR </p><p>EXAMPLE, A MEETING OF SUNNI RELIGIOUS AND POLITICAL </p><p>NOTABLES AT THE DAR AL-FATWA, THE SEAT OF THE GRAND </p><p>MUFTI, MIGHT ISSUE A SET OF CONDITIONS THAT WOULD </p><p>HAVE TO BE MET BEFORE A SUNNI COULD ACCEPT THE </p><p>PREMIERSHIP.  THIS WOULD ALLOW THE NEW PRIME </p><p>MINISTER TO CLAIM THE BACKING OF THE SUNNI </p><p>COMMUNITY FOR NEW TERMS FOR HIS PARTICIPATION, THUS </p><p>MORE OR LESS TURNING THE PAGE ON KARAMI\'S </p><p>RESIGNATION.  WE CANNOT PRECLUDE THAT, UNDER THESE </p><p>CIRCUMSTANCES, KARAMI HIMSELF MIGHT NOT BE </p><p>REINCARNATED. </p><p> </p><p>17.  POSSIBLE PRECONDITIONS (APART FROM </p><p>CONCILIATORY STATEMENTS AND GESTURES FROM AMAL AND </p><p>THE PSP) INCLUDE AN AGREEMENT THAT BARRI AND </p><p>JUMBLATT WOULD PARTICIPATE IN CABINET MEETINGS, AND </p><p>THE IMPLEMENTATION OF AN EFFECTIVE SECURITY PLAN </p><p>FOR THE SUNNI HEARTLANDS OF WEST BEIRUT, SIDON, AND </p><p>POSSIBLY TRIPOLI.  ANY OF THE ABOVE CONCESSIONS </p><p>WOULD BE HARD TO EXTRACT FROM THE SHIA, WHO ARE </p><p>RIDING HIGH AT PRESENT.  THUS THE CABINET CRISIS </p><p>MIGHT BECOME A DRAWN-OUT AFFAIR. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>FORMING A NEW GOVERNMENT </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>18.  AS FOR THE FORMATION OF A NEW GOVERNMENT, WE </p><p>SEE TWO PRIMARY OPTIONS.  THE FIRST, A SMALL </p><p>CABINET MUCH LIKE THE OUTGOING "NATIONAL UNITY </p><p>GOVERNMENT," APPEARS DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE UNDER </p><p>PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES.  BASICALLY THE SAME </p><p>PERSONALITIES WOULD BE INVOLVED, AND THE SAME </p><p>ANIMOSITIES WOULD REAPPEAR.  IN SUM, THE </p><p>DIFFICULTIES FACED BY THE KARAMI GOVERNMENT ARE </p><p>PROBABLY TOO DEEP TO BE SIMPLY PAPERED OVER, </p><p>ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE RISE OF SHIA POWER VIS-A-VIS </p><p>THEIR SUNNI CORELIGIONISTS.  THE SECOND, AN </p><p>ENLARGED GOVERNMENT, RUMORS OF WHICH HAVE BEEN </p><p>CIRCULATING FOR SEVERAL MONTHS, MIGHT PROVE A MORE </p><p>FEASIBLE OPTION.  IN THIS CASE, WE WOULD POINT OUT </p><p>THE REPUTATION OF FORMER PRIME MINISTER TAKIADDIN </p><p>SOLH AS A CONCILIATOR PRESIDING OVER LARGE </p><p>GOVERNMENTS (THOUGH AGAIN, WE RECALL KARAMI\'S </p><p>PHOENIX-LIKE QUALITIES). </p><p> </p><p>BARTHOLOMEW </p><p></p></div>
