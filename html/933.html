<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ISLAMABAD 003474 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT ALSO FOR SA/PAB AND S/CT </p><p>LONDON FOR POL:TUELLER </p><p>CENTCOM/CINCPAC ALSO FOR POLAD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  5/10/08 </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, PTER, AF, PK </p><p>SUBJECT:  FOREIGN SECRETARY RAPS USG KNUCKLES ON "ONE-SIDEDNESS" OF </p><p>TERRORISM REPORT </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A. ISLAMABAD 3446; B. ISLAMABAD 3358 </p><p> </p><p>(U) CLASSIFIED BY CHARGE ALAN EASTHAM.  REASON:  1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY:  FOREIGN SECRETARY SHAMSHAD AHMED COMPLAINED TO THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR ON MAY 8 ABOUT THE "ONE-SIDED VIEW" OF THE JUST-RELEASED </p><p>USG REPORT ON TERRORISM, LAMENTING THAT INDIA WAS PORTRAYED MORE </p><p>POSITIVELY THAN PAKISTAN.  ACKNOWLEDGING A RECENT RESPITE (WITH THE </p><p>EXCEPTION OF THE APRIL 26/27 KILLINGS OF 22 PEOPLE IN AZAD KASHMIR </p><p>-- REF B), SHAMSHAD URGED THE U.S. TO USE ITS INFLUENCE IN DELHI TO </p><p>STOP INDIAN SUPPORT FOR CROSS-BORDER TERRORISM.  CONCERNING THE </p><p>APRIL 26/27 INCIDENT, SHAMSHAD SAID THE GOP HAD CONSCIOUSLY DECIDED </p><p>NOT TO RETALIATE, BUT WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO CONTINUE SUCH RESTRAINT </p><p>IF THERE WERE REPEATS OF SUCH INCIDENTS.  HE NOTED THAT IN THE </p><p>CONTEXT OF INCIDENTS OF THIS NATURE, DIALOGUE WITH INDIA WOULD BE </p><p>DIFFICULT, BUT HE SAID THE GOP NEVERTHELESS LOOKS FORWARD TO A </p><p>SUMMIT MEETING WITH THE INDIANS IN COLOMBO IN JULY TO EXPLORE HOW </p><p>TO PROCEED WITH THE DIALOGUE.  THE AMBASSADOR APPLAUDED THE GOP </p><p>RESTRAINT IN THE WAKE OF THE "SHOCKING" EVENT OF APRIL 26/27 AND </p><p>NOTED THAT HE UNDERSTOOD SHAMSHAD\'S POINT THAT SUCH RESTRAINT WOULD </p><p>NOT BE LIMITLESS IF THERE WERE REPEATS OF SUCH TRAGIC INCIDENTS. </p><p>SHIFTING TO AFGHANISTAN, SHAMSHAD SAID THE GOP IS ENHEARTENED BY </p><p>THE TALIBAN AGREEMENT TO RELEASE 1000 TONS OF FOOD FOR BAMIYAN AND </p><p>SAID ISLAMABAD IS PUSHING FOR A COORDINATORS\' MEETING BETWEEN THE </p><p>TWO SIDES.  (SEE REF A FOR DISCUSSION CONCERNING THE INDEPENDENT </p><p>POWER PROJECTS.) END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) FOREIGN SECRETARY SHAMSHAD AHMED CALLED IN THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>MAY 8 TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE RECENTLY-RELEASED USG REPORT, "PATTERNS </p><p>OF GLOBAL TERRORISM."  ACCORDING TO SHAMSHAD, THE REPORT GAVE A </p><p>"ONE-SIDED VIEW" OF THE SITUATIONS IN INDIA AND PAKISTAN.  HE </p><p>POINTED OUT THAT THE PAKISTAN SECTION OF THE REPORT HIGHLIGHTED </p><p>SECTARIAN VIOLENCE AND THE HARAKAT-UL-ANSAR, WHILE THE INDIA </p><p>SECTION EMPHASIZED THE MILITANCY IN INDIAN-HELD KASHMIR, WHICH -- </p><p>SHAMSHAD STRESSED -- IS ACTUALLY "AN INDIGENOUS FREEDOM STRUGGLE." </p><p>HE DECRIED THAT THE REPORT REFERRED TO NUMEROUS BOMBINGS IN INDIA </p><p>(ASCRIBED TO CROSS-BORDER SUPPORT FOR TERRORISM), WHILE THE REPORT </p><p>MAKES NO MENTION OF TERRORIST BOMBINGS IN PAKISTAN, IN WHICH THE </p><p>INDIANS HAVE HAD A ROLE, HE ADDED.  "WE EXPECTED THE USG TO </p><p>UNDERTAKE AN OBJECTIVE REVIEW OF THE SITUATIONS IN BOTH COUNTRIES," </p><p>HE LAMENTED.  "WASHINGTON," HE CONTINUED, "MUST USE ITS INFLUENCE </p><p>IN DELHI TO STOP GOI SUPPORT FOR CROSS-BORDER TERRORISM." </p><p>FINISHING HIS THOUGHT, SHAMSHAD NOTED THAT IN RECENT WEEKS THERE </p><p>HAS BEEN A "RESPITE" IN INDIAN-SUPPORTED TERRORISM IN PAKISTAN, </p><p>WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE APRIL 26/27 SLAYINGS OF 22 KASHMIRIS IN </p><p>AZAD KASHMIR (REF B). </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) SHUFFLING NOTES, SHAMSHAD GAVE A VIRTUALLY VERBATIM REPEAT </p><p>OF A MAY 4 BRIEFING GIVEN BY MFA ADDITIONAL SECRETARY (SOUTH ASIA) </p><p>TARIQ ALTAF (AND ATTENDED BY POLOFF) ON THE KILLINGS IN AZAD </p><p>KASHMIR.  DESCRIBING THE INCIDENT AS "VERY SERIOUS," SHAMSHAD SAID </p><p>THE INCIDENT WAS THE FIRST "TRANS-LINE OF CONTROL" INCIDENT OF THAT </p><p>NATURE -- "THE ATTACK ACROSS THE LOC VIOLATED THE SANCTITY OF THE </p><p>LINE OF CONTROL, SOMETHING WHICH MUST BE RESPECTED."  PAKISTAN, HE </p><p>SAID, HAS MADE A DELIBERATE DECISION NOT TO RETALIATE TO REDUCE </p><p>RISKS OF THE SITUATION "GETTING OUT OF CONTROL."  HE ADDED THAT THE </p><p>INCIDENT HAS HAD A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON PUBLIC OPINION, AND THERE </p><p>MUST BE AN IMMEDIATE END TO SUCH EVENTS, WARNING THAT IF THERE ARE </p><p>MORE SUCH INCIDENTS, "PAKISTAN WOULD FIND IT HARD NOT TO </p><p>RETALIATE."  OBSERVING THAT PAKISTAN CONDEMNS TERRORIST ACTS IN </p><p>INDIAN-HELD KASHMIR, SHAMSHAD DECLARED THAT THERE IS A "QUALITATIVE </p><p>DIFFERENCE" BETWEEN VIOLENT ACTS ON THE INDIAN SIDE -- "THERE\'S A </p><p>FREEDOM STRUGGLE UNDERWAY THERE" -- AND THE PAK SIDE, "WHERE THERE </p><p>IS NO SUCH STRUGGLE." </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) SHIFTING FOCUS, SHAMSHAD ASSERTED THAT "PAKISTAN HAS BEEN </p><p>WAITING FOR THE OPPORTUNE TIME TO PICK UP THE THREAD OF INDO-PAK </p><p>DIALOGUE."  HE EXPRESSED THE HOPE THAT DELHI WOULD "ADOPT A SERIOUS </p><p>ATTITUDE" TO IMPROVE THE ENVIRONMENT FOR RESUMING THE DIALOGUE. </p><p>DECLARING THAT THE PEOPLE OF PAKISTAN NEED TO BE CONVINCED ON THE </p><p>DIALOGUE, SHAMSHAD SAID THAT IN THE CURRENT ATMOSPHERE "NO </p><p>GOVERNMENT CAN AFFORD TO CARRY ON THE TALKS."  SHAMSHAD OBSERVED </p><p>THAT ISLAMABAD NEVERTHELESS IS "EARNESTLY LOOKING FORWARD" TO THE </p><p>TWO PRIME MINISTERS\' MEETING IN COLOMBO "TO EXPLORE THE </p><p>OPPORTUNITIES FOR DIALOGUE."  HE SAID ISLAMABAD WOULD SEND </p><p>INSTRUCTIONS TO ITS HIGH COMMISSION IN DELHI TO THIS EFFECT, BUT </p><p>"ONLY AFTER THE CURRENT PUBLIC ATTITUDE SUBSIDES."  WASHINGTON, HE </p><p>ADDED, CAN PLAY A ROLE IN KEEPING TEMPERS LOW.  RETURNING TO HIS </p><p>THEME AT THE BEGINNING OF THE MEETING, SHAMSHAD SAID WASHINGTON </p><p>SHOULD AVOID TAKING PRO-INDIAN STANCES WHICH PROVOKE A PAKISTANI </p><p>REACTION, ADDING THAT THE GOP "IS DOING ITS BEST" TO CONTROL THE </p><p>PUBLIC REACTION TO THE RECENTLY-ANNOUNCED MTCR-RELATED SANCTIONS ON </p><p>KHAN RESEARCH LABORATORIES.  THE AMBASSADOR OBSERVED THAT THE GOP </p><p>SEEMED TO BE SUCCEEDING IN THAT REGARD AS THE REACTION HAS BEEN </p><p>"MODEST." </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) RESPONDING TO SHAMSHAD\'S LENGTHY MONOLOGUE, THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>SAID HE WOULD CONVEY TO WASHINGTON THE GOP\'S CONCERNS ABOUT THE </p><p>TERRORISM REPORT.  DODGING THE AMBASSADOR\'S SEVERAL QUESTIONS </p><p>CONCERNING WHY THE ATTACKERS IN THE APRIL 26/27 INCIDENT FOCUSSED </p><p>ON ONLY TWO FAMILIES, SHAMSHAD SAID THE KILLERS WANTED TO GIVE THE </p><p>APPEARANCE THAT THE INCIDENT WAS "AN INSIDE JOB."  RESPONDING TO </p><p>ANOTHER QUERY, SHAMSHAD SAID THE GOP WAS SURE THE ATTACKERS HAD </p><p>COME FROM ACROSS THE LOC -- "WE HAVE INTERCEPTS THAT MAKE THAT </p><p>CLEAR," HE NOTED.  TERMING THE INCIDENT "SHOCKING AND </p><p>UNFORGIVABLE," THE AMBASSADOR APPLAUDED THE RESTRAINT THAT PAKISTAN </p><p>HAS EXERCISED IN THE WAKE OF THE INCIDENT, ADDING THAT HE </p><p>UNDERSTANDS SHAMSHAD\'S POINT THAT SUCH RESTRAINT WOULD NOT BE </p><p>LIMITLESS IF SUCH INCIDENTS WERE REPEATED.  THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>UNDERSCORED THAT THE INCIDENT SHOULD BE A TOPIC OF DISCUSSION FOR </p><p>THE INDO-PAK DIALOGUE.  RETURNING YET AGAIN TO HIS THEME OF USG </p><p>ONE-SIDEDNESS, SHAMSHAD REGRETTED THAT THE USG HAD NOT ISSUED A </p><p>STATEMENT CONDEMNING THE KILLINGS, REITERATING THAT WASHINGTON DOES </p><p>NOT MENTION THE INDIAN ROLE IN FOMENTING VIOLENCE IN PAKISTAN -- </p><p>"FOR US THIS IS VERY HARD TO EXPLAIN TO THE PEOPLE," HE ADDED. </p><p>WARMING TO THIS THEME, SHAMSHAD REGRETTED THE REPORTED WASHINGTON </p><p>DENIAL THAT IT WAS CONSIDERING SANCTIONING INDIA ON THE SAGARIKA </p><p>MISSILE. </p><p> </p><p>"BREAKTHROUGH ON AFGHANISTAN" </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) TURNING TO THE RECENT AFGHANISTAN STEERING COMMITTEE TALKS </p><p>IN ISLAMABAD BETWEEN THE TALIBAN AND THE NORTHERN ALLIANCE, </p><p>SHAMSHAD SAID THE TALKS HAD BEEN "A GOOD SUCCESS, A MAJOR </p><p>BREAKTHROUGH, THE FIRST TIME IN A FEW YEARS THAT THE SIDES SAT </p><p>TOGETHER FACE-TO-FACE."  HE GAVE THE U.S. AND HIS OWN GOVERNMENT </p><p>CREDIT FOR THE MEETINGS.  PAKISTAN\'S DESIRE, HE ADDED, IS TO </p><p>FACILITATE THE AFGHANISTAN DIALOGUE PROCESS, AND HE RECOUNTED PAK </p><p>EFFORTS TO BRING ABOUT THE TALKS.  HE NOTED THAT ALTHOUGH THE FIVE </p><p>DAYS OF TALKS HAD BEEN "INCONCLUSIVE," ONE SHOULD NOT BE </p><p>DISCOURAGED -- "PAKISTAN IS KEEPING IN TOUCH WITH ALL PARTIES." </p><p>TAKING CREDIT FOR THE RECENT TALIBAN ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THEY WOULD </p><p>ALLOW 1000 TONS OF FOOD AID INTO BAMIYAN PROVINCE, SHAMSHAD SAID </p><p>THIS "MAKES QUITE CLEAR THAT IF YOU DEAL WITH THE TALIBAN, THEN YOU </p><p>CAN GET EVERYTHING."  THE AMBASSADOR SUGGESTED THAT "MAYBE NOT </p><p>EVERYTHING."  WHAT IS IMPORTANT, SHAMSHAD UNDERSCORED, IS HOW ONE </p><p>DEALS WITH THE TALIBAN.  SCORING THE TALIBAN ANNOUNCEMENT AS A </p><p>POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT, SHAMSHAD SAID THE GOP IS NOW PUSHING FOR A </p><p>"COORDINATORS\' MEETING" BETWEEN THE TWO SIDES -- "PAKISTAN IS </p><p>INTENSIFYING ITS EFFORTS TO GET THE TWO SIDES BACK TOGETHER SOON; </p><p>WE MUST NOT LOSE THE MOMENTUM."  HE PROMISED TO KEEP THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>FULLY INFORMED OF THE GOP\'S PROGRESS ON THE AFGHANISTAN FRONT. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) NOTING AGREEMENT WITH THE GOP ON AFGHANISTAN, THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>OBSERVED THAT HE WOULD CHARACTERIZE THE STEERING COMMITTEE MEETING </p><p>AS "A STEP FORWARD" RATHER THAN A BREAKTHROUGH.  HE ALSO EXPRESSED </p><p>APPRECIATION FOR THE GOP\'S CONTRIBUTION IN HELPING MAKE THE MEETING </p><p>HAPPEN.  SHAMSHAD SAID NORTHERN LEADER PROFESSOR RABBANI HAD </p><p>RESPONDED POSITIVELY TO THE TALIBAN ANNOUNCEMENT ON ALLOWING 1000 </p><p>TONS OF FOOD AID INTO BAMIYAN AND WAS NOW CONSULTING HIS ALLIANCE </p><p>COLLEAGUES.  THE FOREIGN SECRETARY SAID DIVERGENCE WITHIN THE </p><p>NORTHERN ALLIANCE WAS "THE BIGGEST PROBLEM," TO WHICH THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR RESPONDED WITH THE OBSERVATION THAT THE TALIBAN, TOO, </p><p>HAD TROUBLES WITHIN ITS OWN RANKS.  SUPPORTING THE NOTION OF A </p><p>COORDINATORS\' MEETING, THE AMBASSADOR OBSERVED THAT THE U.S. AND </p><p>PAKISTAN ARE "ON THE SAME WAVE-LENGTH."  THE MOST IMPORTANT THING, </p><p>THE AMBASSADOR EMPHASIZED, IS THAT THE SIDES CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN </p><p>AGREEMENT ON "NO MILITARY OFFENSIVES."  ALL SIDES, HE UNDERSCORED, </p><p>MUST STAY FOCUSSED ON THIS ESSENTIAL POINT. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) DREDGING UP AN OLD THEME, SHAMSHAD CALLED FOR AN ARMS </p><p>EMBARGO ON AFGHANISTAN AND ASSERTED THAT PAKISTAN IS READY TO </p><p>COOPERATE ON THIS.  HE SAID ISLAMABAD IS "SURPRISED" THAT THE SIX </p><p>PLUS TWO PROCESS IS "SO CASUAL" ON THE NEED FOR AN EMBARGO. </p><p>RESPONDING, THE AMBASSADOR QUOTED UN SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE LAKHDAR </p><p>BRAHIMI AS SAYING THAT IF PAKISTAN AND IRAN AGREE TO CUT OFF ARMS, </p><p>THEN THERE WOULD BE NO NEED FOR AN EMBARGO, AND, WITHOUT PAK- </p><p>IRANIAN AGREEMENT, AN EMBARGO WOULD NOT BE POSSIBLE. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) COMMENT:  THIS MEETING WAS VINTAGE SHAMSHAD, WHO DUTIFULLY-- </p><p>AND WITH SOME PLEASURE -- LAMBASTED AMERICA ON THE LATEST </p><p>PERCEIVED SLIGHT, BUT WAS BEREFT OF ANY FRESH THINKING ON HOW BEST </p><p>TO PROCEED IN STRENGTHENING THE BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP OR ON HOW TO </p><p>WORK TOGETHER MOST CONSTRUCTIVELY IN ADVANCING PEACE IN </p><p>AFGHANISTAN.  BUT, WE HAVE LEARNED NOT TO EXPECT TOO MUCH. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EASTHAM </p><p></p></div>
