<p>UNCLAS AMMAN 004348 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECPS, EAID, JO </p><p>SUBJECT:  Creating Gender Sensitive ICT Synergies </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) SUMMARY: UNIFEM (United Nations Development Fund for </p><p>Women) plans to launch an "E-Village" project that will </p><p>integrate a number of information and communications </p><p>technologies (ICT) efforts underway in Jordan with the </p><p>construction of a computer assembly plant in a village near </p><p>Madaba.  Deema Bibi, UNIFEM ICT program manager for the </p><p>Arab Region, told EconOff the project\'s three main </p><p>objectives were training, economic opportunities, and </p><p>raising gender awareness.  The E-Village will form an ICT </p><p>hub that incorporates gender-sensitive strategies into </p><p>various ICT initiatives.  UNIFEM is in the final stages of </p><p>completing its project plan and hopes to secure the </p><p>necessary sponsorships and commitments by Fall 2003.  END </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) The E-Village project will offer a series of </p><p>different training programs to increase the capacity and </p><p>professional skills of village residents.  The Ministry of </p><p>Education will pilot the E-Learning initiative in E-Village </p><p>schools.  In conjunction with their current programs, </p><p>NetCorps and Microsoft plan to offer IT training and career </p><p>development workshops.  UNIFEM also hopes to create an ICT </p><p>incubator where citizens receive professional support to </p><p>transform their ideas into software/IT programs. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) In addition to training, UNIFEM is working with the </p><p>GOJ, the private sector, and the local IT association, </p><p>Intaj, to provide economic opportunities to the village. </p><p>American-based Polywell has agreed to set up a computer </p><p>assembly plant in the E-Village where villagers can apply </p><p>newly learned skills.  Intaj plans to assist in the </p><p>construction of an E-Services center where program </p><p>graduates can work on national ICT initiatives.  UNIFEM </p><p>also hopes to construct a career counseling and job </p><p>placement center. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) The final objective of the project is to raise </p><p>awareness of the importance of both ICT in development and </p><p>of involving women in the development process.  UNIFEM is </p><p>working with its partners to ensure that its ICT strategies </p><p>in the E-Village specifically target gender inequities. </p><p>UNIFEM will also use the E-Village to host policy advocacy </p><p>activities to support mainstreaming women into ICT. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) COMMENT:  While many ICT projects in the region </p><p>address gender discrepancies in their strategies, the E- </p><p>Village\'s promotion of gender awareness as a central tenet </p><p>of the initiative is unique.  END COMMENT </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
