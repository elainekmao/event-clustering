<p>UNCLAS AMMAN 001082 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>CCOMMERCE FOR 4520/ITA/MAC/ONE/COBERG </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EINV, CASC, ASEC, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDAN-AMERICAN BUSINESS COMMUNITY FORMS OSAC </p><p>COUNTRY COUNCIL </p><p> </p><p> 1.  (U) At a February 18 meeting convened by the U.S. </p><p>Chamber of Commerce in Jordan (the  Jordanian American </p><p>Business Association--JABA), approximately 30 representatives </p><p>of the Jordanian-American business community took the first </p><p>step towards the establishment of an Overseas Security </p><p>Advisory Council (OSAC) Country Council.  The meeting was the </p><p>culmination of a series of informal meetings among Emboffs, </p><p>business reps, and JABA officials,  requested by </p><p>businesspeople with U.S. links looking for a mechanism to </p><p>exchange-security related information and concerns.  The </p><p>meeting was open to JABA members and non-members alike. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) Addressing this initial organizational meeting, Azzam </p><p>Shweihat, JABA Vice Chair, stressed that the meeting was the </p><p>result of ongoing discussions rather than in response to any </p><p>specific threat or anticipated event.  Emboffs from RSO, FCS, </p><p>and Econ described the role, functions, and constitution of </p><p>OSAC and a Country Council, and suggested possible forms a </p><p>local Council could take.  In the discussion that followed, </p><p>attendees expressed security concerns regarding their </p><p>visibility and vulnerability as U.S. or U.S.-affiliated </p><p>institutions in times of conflict and instability.  Possible </p><p>solutions ranged from increased security to a temporary </p><p>removal of signage that suggested an American link. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) The group was nearly unanimous in its conclusion that </p><p>formalizing an information-sharing process via an OSAC </p><p>Country Council would go a long way towards addressing and </p><p>allaying their concerns.  As a result, and in accordance with </p><p>Department guidance, six reps formed an Interim Executive </p><p>Working Group (IEWG) to meet February 23 to discuss next </p><p>steps in forming a Country Council, including working with </p><p>post on logistics, drafting a proposed charter, and setting a </p><p>time for a general meeting.  Emboffs agreed to attend and to </p><p>provide any needed support and assistance. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
