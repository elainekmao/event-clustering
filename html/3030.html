REASON:  1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba was expelled from </p><p>the Nepali Congress Party for three years on May 26.  As a </p><p>counterattack, Deuba plans to call a party General </p><p>Convention, with the possible aim of deposing Nepali Congress </p><p>Party President G.P. Koirala from his post.  On May 27 King </p><p>Gyanendra re-imposed the state of national emergency, which </p><p>had expired on May 25, by royal ordinance until August 27. </p><p>Deuba has not yet formed a new Cabinet and told the </p><p>Ambassador it may be a few weeks before he is able to do so. </p><p>He reiterated to the Ambassador his commitment to holding </p><p>free and fair elections by the November 13 scheduled date. </p><p>Behind-the-scenes efforts to mend the rift between the PM and </p><p>Party President Koirala continue, but for right now the </p><p>oldest, largest party in the country seems remains polarized. </p><p> End summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>NEPALI CONGRESS NO MORE </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) As expected, on May 26 the Central Working </p><p>Committee (CWC) of the Nepali Congress Party revoked Prime </p><p>Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba\'s party membership after he </p><p>defied its directive not to seek extension of the state of </p><p>emergency.  The expulsion, which will remain in effect for </p><p>three years, follows the May 23 suspension of Deuba\'s party </p><p>membership, and is only the most recent step in the unfolding </p><p>confrontation between Deuba and Nepali Congress Party </p><p>President G.P. Koirala. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  Accusing the Party leadership of </p><p>"short-sightedness" and "jealousy," Deuba retaliated by </p><p>announcing that he might try to convene a party General </p><p>Convention.  (Note:  The General Convention meets every five </p><p>years.  However, the Party President must call an </p><p>out-of-cycle General Convention if 25 percent of the </p><p>Convention\'s 1,500 members sign a petition calling for such a </p><p>meeting.  End note.)  The PM has signaled that he might try </p><p>to use the special session of the General Convention to bring </p><p>a no-confidence motion against Party President Koirala. </p><p>(Note:  Two-thirds of the membership is required to carry </p><p>such a motion.  It is not clear if Deuba would have the </p><p>support within the party to carry such a vote.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>EMERGENCY EXTENDED </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) Also as expected, on May 27 King Gyanendra </p><p>re-instituted, by royal ordinance, the state of national </p><p>emergency that had lapsed the previous day.  The Prime </p><p>Minister was forced to rely upon a royal ordinance to </p><p>resurrect the emergency since neither house of </p><p>Parliament--with the Lower House dissolved late May 22 and </p><p>the Upper House prorogued on May 24--was in session when the </p><p>emergency expired.  Under the Constitution, the reinstated </p><p>emergency may last for only an additional three months--until </p><p>August 27.  (Note:  A Parliamentary extension would have </p><p>bought the Government an additional six months.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>A RETROFITTED CABINET? </p><p>NOT YET </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Deuba has made no move yet to refit his Cabinet--a </p><p>Cabinet whose bloated size and general inefficiency proved a </p><p>source of constant criticism for the PM from both inside and </p><p>outside his party, as well as from donors, including us.  The </p><p>PM\'s much-anticipated May 24 televised address to the nation </p><p>focused primarily on his reasons for seeking an extension to </p><p>the emergency--and thus for defying his party\'s orders--and </p><p>his decision to dissolve Parliament and call for new </p><p>elections.  Only two of the 39 members of his Cabinet have </p><p>tendered resignations, one of whom--former Finance Minister </p><p>Ram Sharan Mahat--has already signaled his willingness to </p><p>rejoin a new Cabinet (Ref B).  (Women, Children and Social </p><p>Welfare Minister Kharel has rescinded his May 24 offer to </p><p>resign and is back in.)  At a May 27 dinner, the PM told the </p><p>Ambassador he may have to defer addressing the question of a </p><p>new Cabinet for at least a few weeks as his attention is </p><p>riveted on more urgent matters, such as ensuring that free </p><p>and fair elections take place as scheduled by November 13. </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  Party President G.P. Koirala\'s support is generally </p><p>deemed more solid among party rank-and-file out in the </p><p>districts.  Thus Deuba\'s threat to convoke a General </p><p>Convention--if indeed he could garner the signatures to do </p><p>so--may be no more than a feint in the continuously </p><p>escalating tit-for-tat between the PM and his rival that now </p><p>threatens to split Nepali democracy\'s founding party.  While </p><p>some party insiders, such as former FinMin Mahat, continue to </p><p>hold out hope that behind-the-scenes efforts may help defuse </p><p>the confrontation, the rapid chain of events over the past </p><p>weeek has not been especially promising.  With each </p><p>successive move, the antagonists raise the stakes still </p><p>higher--and back themselves further and further into </p><p>increasingly narrow corners.  Koirala\'s strident claims of an </p><p>anti-democratic conspiracy in Deuba\'s actions (Ref A) can </p><p>only exacerbate the rift.  That said, both combatants\' sense </p><p>of political survival--and the realization that neither can </p><p>do well in the upcoming elections if the Nepali Congress </p><p>splits--may yet succeed in keeping the strife-ridden party </p><p>together. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
