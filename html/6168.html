<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 000448 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/05/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, ASEC, KDEM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA:  LEADING OPPOSITION POLITICIAN KILLED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter.  Reasons:  1.5 (B & </p><p>D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  Leading Nigerian opposition politician Marshall </p><p>Harry was killed in the early morning hours of March 5. </p><p>Marshall was a founding member of the ruling People\'s </p><p>Democratic Party (PDP) but split from the group over </p><p>disputes with President Olusegun Obasanjo and Rivers state </p><p>Governor Peter Odili.  He was recently named the South- </p><p>South Zonal Vice Chairman in the leading opposition party, </p><p>the All Nigeria People\'s Party (ANPP). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  According to one of his aides, Harry arrived in </p><p>Abuja March 5 from his home in Port Harcourt, Rivers State. </p><p>That evening he held a meeting with someone from the Buhari </p><p>presidential campaign organization.  Following this </p><p>meeting, Marshall met with ANPP Chairman Don Etiebet. </p><p>According to the aide, he made a phone call home between </p><p>these two meetings and asked whether the police had arrived </p><p>at his Port Harcourt office.  (NOTE:  It is possible that </p><p>he expected to be detained over an attempted political </p><p>rally in Port Harcourt which Odili had banned.  END NOTE.) </p><p>Following his meeting with Etiebet, he had dinner with an </p><p>unidentified politician.  (NOTE:  From the description of </p><p>one journalist, this politician could be former PDP </p><p>activist and leading member of the Arewa Consultative Forum </p><p>Sunday Awoniyi.  END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  Figures close to ANPP Presidential candidate </p><p>Muhammadu Buhari assert that Harry\'s murder was politically </p><p>motivated and imply that the ruling PDP had an interest in </p><p>seeing Harry eliminated, but they stop short of naming </p><p>names.  In April of last year, a lawyer claiming to </p><p>represent Harry asserted that his client\'s life was in </p><p>danger because of his opposition to Odili and sought police </p><p>protection. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  According to Harry\'s security guards, at least two </p><p>men entered his compound at around 3:30 AM, attacked them </p><p>and tied them up.  They then entered the house where they </p><p>confronted Marshall and his daughter.  The daughter says </p><p>that they offered the attackers money and jewelry to leave, </p><p>but the men refused.  They shot Marshall twice in the </p><p>abdomen and fled the house.  A photograph of the crime </p><p>scene shows a spartan, linoleum-tiled bedroom with a </p><p>massive bloodstain near the foot of the bed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  In a meeting with Ambassador and DCM the morning </p><p>of the attack, State Security Service Director-General </p><p>Lateef Kayode Are downplayed the political angle, </p><p>contending that Harry died as the result of a bungled armed </p><p>robbery.  Harry and Odili actually got along quite well, </p><p>Are asserted, claiming that Harry was Odili\'s "mole" in the </p><p>South-South ANPP. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  COMMENT:  Press reports strongly suggest that </p><p>Harry was targeted.  Assuming it was politically motivated, </p><p>this is the most significant assassination since Justice </p><p>Minister Bola Ige\'s murder in December, 2001.  Whether the </p><p>attack was political or criminal, it will be viewed by the </p><p>political opposition and many Nigerians as an attempt to </p><p>stifle and frighten the opposition.  For their part, the </p><p>government and ruling party have condemned the murder. </p><p>This will not account for much unless the police are seen </p><p>as actively pursuing Harry\'s killer, something that was not </p><p>done in Ige\'s case.  With Buhari\'s presidential campaign </p><p>due to open in Harry\'s home town of Port Harcourt on </p><p>Saturday, the linkage will be inevitable and the event on </p><p>Saturday perhaps has acquired extra significance due to </p><p>this tragedy.  In any case, the murder of a Vice Chairman </p><p>of the ANPP will increase political tensions and </p><p>uncertainty in the run-up to a much-criticized and hotly- </p><p>contested election process. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
