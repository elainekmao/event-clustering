<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 OTTAWA 002128 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR WHA/CAN, WHA/PDA </p><p>WHITE HOUSE PASS NSC/WEUROPE, NSC/WHA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, KMDR, OIIP, OPRC, CA, TFUS01, TFUS02, TFUS03 </p><p>SUBJECT:  MEDIA REACTION: IRAQ; MIDDLE EAST; AFRICA; </p><p>ARGENTINA </p><p> </p><p>IRAQ </p><p>1.   "Two down, one to go" </p><p>Under the sub-heading, "The good news from Iraq: </p><p>There\'s food in the markets, a new governing council </p><p>and Saddam\'s sons are dead," columnist Margaret Wente </p><p>wrote in the leading Globe and Mail (7/24): "As for the </p><p>situation in Iraq, I have a hunch it\'s going better </p><p>than the daily dose of woe dished up by the media might </p><p>lead us to believe. According to the media, Iraq is </p><p>Vietnam, with an all-out guerrilla war, a hostile local </p><p>population, anarchy in the streets, and American troops </p><p>who are ready to frag the brass.... Don\'t get me wrong. </p><p>Iraq will be a three-Excedrin headache for a long time </p><p>to come. Maybe it will all blow up. But please allow me </p><p>a tiny scrap of optimism. It could be going a whole lot </p><p>worse. And it\'s probably going a whole lot better than </p><p>you\'d think if you watched the news." </p><p> </p><p>2.   "Bush needs the UN" </p><p>Editorialist Serge Truffaut wrote in the liberal Le </p><p>Devoir (7/24): "This past week, the White House has </p><p>been juggling again with the UN. More precisely, </p><p>Secretary of State Colin Powell is dueling with the two </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>most UN-allergic people, Vice-President Dick Cheney and </p><p>his mentor Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld. Between </p><p>the lines, Powell is letting it be known that a new </p><p>resolution could be presented to the members of the </p><p>Security Council in order to envision a larger </p><p>coalition. This about-face is caused by the </p><p>difficulties facing the military on the ground and the </p><p>interim administration of Paul Bremer.... According to </p><p>Bush\'s legal position, Resolution 1483...allows any </p><p>country that so wishes to support the military effort </p><p>without rewording the [UN] resolution. France and </p><p>Germany, for example, could send troops under the aegis </p><p>of NATO. Nothing is less certain or desirable.... More </p><p>fundamentally, if an increase in the number of soldiers </p><p>is vital for the security of the Iraqis, then the Blair- </p><p>Bush duo should take a lower profile while the case is </p><p>handed over to the UN." </p><p> </p><p>3.   "Pacifying Iraq" </p><p>Editorialist Julie Lemieux wrote in the centrist Le </p><p>Soleil (7/24): "The key to the success of the military </p><p>operations in Iraq resides in the ability of the </p><p>Americans to raise the standard of living of the Iraqi </p><p>people. This won\'t be achieved as long as the country </p><p>remains mired in chaos, violence and crime.... In light </p><p>of the difficulties facing the British-American troops </p><p>on the grounds, one can wonder if the time has not come </p><p>for the Americans to admit they need help. By calling </p><p>on Old Europe to create a UN-led neutral coalition, the </p><p>U.S. would give itself all the chances in the world of </p><p>restoring order in Iraq and helping it recovering its </p><p>freedom. For now the Americans still seem to be </p><p>considered an occupation force rather than an army of </p><p>liberation by a good part of the Iraqi people. But one </p><p>could think this scenario would change if the </p><p>international community were called upon to play a </p><p>greater role." </p><p> </p><p>4.   "Two troubling questions about Iraq" </p><p>Columnist Gilles Paquin wrote in the centrist La Presse </p><p>(7/24): "Iraqis are waiting for irrefutable evidence. </p><p>After having been fed propaganda for thirty years, we </p><p>can understand their skepticism towards the powers that </p><p>be.... The evidence unveiled by General Sanchez is </p><p>essentially based on the identification of the bodies </p><p>by old regime officials detained by the Americans.... </p><p>It also rests on X-rays that made it possible to </p><p>identify old wounds suffered by the two men.... </p><p>Meanwhile doubts remain.... Iraqis will remember with </p><p>bitterness the bragging of American military officials </p><p>who claimed to have killed General Ali Hassan al-Majid, </p><p>aka Chemical Ali, this past April 7.  On June 6, </p><p>General Myers admitted the man was still alive." </p><p> </p><p>5.   "The Failure" </p><p>Editorialist Mario Roy wrote in the centrist La Presse </p><p>(7/23): "Yesterday Koffi Annan presented to the </p><p>Security Council a first report on the post war </p><p>situation in Iraq.... Let\'s not insist too much on the </p><p>apparent contradiction between the concern for security </p><p>and the desired withdrawal of the only group which can </p><p>at the present time insure that security...precisely </p><p>because no on else wants to step in. Let\'s rather focus </p><p>on the fact that the debate will center on the </p><p>opportunity of voting on a second resolution at the </p><p>Security Council (which roughly speaking is wished for </p><p>by `Old Europe,\' deemed superfluous by the U.S. and put </p><p>on hold by the UN).  This is more a matter of power </p><p>than legal correctness.  The point is to extract from </p><p>Washington the control over the reconstruction of Iraq, </p><p>the flow of money that will be funneled into it and </p><p>eventually the important levers for the economic future </p><p>of the country. This time, the Americans find </p><p>themselves in the position of having to make some </p><p>concessions." </p><p> </p><p>6.   "Better than they deserved" </p><p>The conservative National Post opined (7/23): "The U.S. </p><p>military turned up two aces in Mosul, Iraq yesterday - </p><p>Uday and Qusay Hussein, respectively </p><p>the aces of hearts and clubs in the \'most-wanted\' card </p><p>decks issued to U.S. troops.... Indeed, our single </p><p>regret is that the brothers were not taken alive. Uday </p><p>and Qusay were spoiled, pampered men who - like most </p><p>cruel bullies - would no doubt have spilled out </p><p>everything they knew once they found themselves on the </p><p>wrong side of the interrogation table. An Iraqi </p><p>court might then have passed sentence on them for their </p><p>crimes against humanity, and they would have spent the </p><p>rest of their lives in jail (assuming an Iraqi mob did </p><p>not tear them limb from limb first). Death in battle </p><p>was too dignified a fate for these foul human </p><p>specimens." </p><p> </p><p>MIDDLE EAST </p><p>7.   "Israel\'s prisoners dilemma" </p><p>The conservative National Post opined (7/24): "Will the </p><p>road map to Middle East peace go the way of the Oslo </p><p>accords? We hope not. But there are many troubling </p><p>signs. Principal among them is Israel\'s recent </p><p>announcement that it may accede to demands to release </p><p>several thousand of the roughly 6,000 Palestinian </p><p>prisoners held in the nation\'s jails and detention </p><p>centres - even without first obtaining a promise from </p><p>Palestinian Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas to disarm the </p><p>very terrorist groups in whose ranks many of Israel\'s </p><p>prisoners once served.... The Bush administration, </p><p>which is pushing Israel to release as many prisoners as </p><p>possible, should learn from history. </p><p>Israel released 415 members of the terrorist group </p><p>Hamas in 1992; many of them returned to the practice of </p><p>terror.... There is some room for compromise here. Many </p><p>of Israel\'s Palestinian prisoners are not terror </p><p>suspects, and Israel might be able to release these men </p><p>without too much risk. Such a gesture would go some way </p><p>to validating Mr. Abbas in the eyes of ordinary </p><p>Palestinians -a worthy objective given that he is a </p><p>sensible man whose loss would set the peace process </p><p>back years. Any compromise along these lines will </p><p>likely fail to satisfy the Palestinians: They demand </p><p>the release of the imprisoned terrorists, too - whom </p><p>they refer to euphemistically as \'political prisoners.\' </p><p>But unless and until Mr. Abbas agrees to liquidate and </p><p>disarm the terrorist groups who operate in the West </p><p>Bank and Gaza, any talk of releasing Palestinians </p><p>implicated in terrorism from Israeli jails is </p><p>premature." </p><p> </p><p>AFRICA </p><p>8.   "Bush must not fail to pick up the challenge of </p><p>Liberia" </p><p>The left-of-center Vancouver Sun (7/23) commented: </p><p>"...Intervention in Liberia is a tough call for </p><p>President George Bush. His country has no direct </p><p>national interest in the country where President </p><p>Charles Taylor is under UN indictment for war crimes in </p><p>neighbouring Sierra Leone, one of a patchwork </p><p>of regional civil wars that include Guinea and Ivory </p><p>Coast.... There are good arguments against Americans </p><p>being the first on the ground to try to halt the war, </p><p>and equally good ones for it to intervene. But the tone </p><p>coming from the White House on Liberia is one of dither </p><p>and indecision. The U.S. and Liberia have strong </p><p>historic links. The country was established in the </p><p>1840s as a homeland for freed American slaves.... While </p><p>the U.S. may have no direct and contemporary interest </p><p>in Liberia, that presents President Bush </p><p>with an opportunity. Critics say the U.S. is only using </p><p>its pre-eminent military power in its own self- </p><p>interest; Liberia could prove that\'s not so. The U.S. </p><p>could show it\'s willing to shoulder responsibilities </p><p>shirked by the UN. It may be the most practical </p><p>strategy is for a West African force supported by the </p><p>U.S. But president Bush does no favour for either </p><p>himself or his country by failing to pick up this </p><p>challenge." </p><p> </p><p>ARGENTINA </p><p>9.   "Argentina\'s popular President" </p><p>Foreign affairs columnist Marcus Gee observed in the </p><p>leading Globe and Mail (7/24): "When Nestor Kirchner </p><p>was elected president of Argentina in May, his chances </p><p>of success seemed slim.... Many said that the </p><p>colourless 53-year-old with a pronounced lisp was </p><p>doomed to become a lame duck. Some duck. Barely </p><p>two months later, Mr. Kirchner, who travelled to </p><p>Washington this week for his first official meeting </p><p>with President George W. Bush, is the most popular man </p><p>in his country, with a 75 per cent approval rating. </p><p>Promising to bring \'a cold wind of change\' from his </p><p>chilly southern province, Mr. Kirchner has thrilled the </p><p>public by taking on just about every power bastion </p><p>in the country. First, he forced most of the military </p><p>top brass into early retirement.... Then he forced the </p><p>unpopular chief justice to resign. Most inspiring has </p><p>been his decision to take on Argentina\'s unpunished </p><p>human-rights abusers.... To make sure that justice is </p><p>done, Mr. Kirchner is preparing to repeal a decree that </p><p>made it impossible for human-rights violators to be </p><p>extradited for trial abroad.... Mr. Kirchner and his </p><p>ministers have also indicated they will seek to </p><p>overturn two much-disputed 1987 laws that bar the </p><p>prosecution of military officers for dirty-war </p><p>crimes.... Cynics say that Mr. Kirchner is only making </p><p>a fuss about human rights to draw attention away from </p><p>the country\'s present-day troubles, such as the </p><p>crippled banking system and the country\'s $197-billion </p><p>debt. But he has a point about impunity. People who </p><p>don\'t face up to the misdeeds of their past are not </p><p>likely to be happy or successful in life. Countries are </p><p>no different.... A country with a recent past as </p><p>terrible as Argentina\'s cannot just pretend it never </p><p>happened. Like a festering wound, the unpunished crimes </p><p>of the dirty war have infected the nation, undermining </p><p>faith in government and contributing to the deep and </p><p>bitter disillusionment that afflicts almost every </p><p>Argentine. In his inaugural address, Mr. Kirchner </p><p>promised to govern \'without rancour but with memory.\' </p><p>More power to him." </p><p> </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
