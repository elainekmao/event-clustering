<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 002298 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR PRM/ANE, EUR/SE, EUR/PRA AND NEA/NGA </p><p>DEPT PASS USAID FOR BHA/OFDA - WGARVELINK AND FFP </p><p>EUCOM FOR JE, JR, J5, SOJ7 AND POLAD </p><p>GENEVA FOR RMA </p><p>CENTCOM FOR J3, J5 AND POLAD </p><p>KUWAIT FOR MDRO AND HOC </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/08/2008 </p><p>TAGS: EAID, IZ, MOPS, PREF, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZ01: GOT AND TURKISH RED CRESCENT ATTEMPTING TO </p><p>COORDINATE PLANNED AID FOR IRAQ WITH THE ICRC </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 2191 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary:  MFA organized a meeting of Turkish Red </p><p>Crescent (TRC), International Committee of the Red Cross and </p><p>U.S. Embassy representatives to present and discuss a TRC </p><p>proposal to send humanitarian supplies to Iraq and provide </p><p>medical treatment in Turkey for injured Iraqis.  The proposal </p><p>contemplates one convoy for northern Iraq and one for the </p><p>south.  ICRC responded that TRC and its counterparts in </p><p>front-line states must coordinate their assistance through </p><p>ICRC.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) MFA Deputy Director General for International </p><p>Political Organizations Tunc Ugdul hosted a joint MFA - </p><p>Turkish Red Crescent (TRC) - International Committee of the </p><p>Red Cross (ICRC) - U.S. Embassy meeting on April 8 to discuss </p><p>Turkey\'s plan, through its Red Crescent Society, to deliver </p><p>humanitarian relief to Iraq.  TRC President Ertan Gonen, ICRC </p><p>Regional Representative Finn Ruda, Econ Counselor and Mission </p><p>Disaster Relief Officer attended the meeting. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Gonen stated that Turkey would like to send </p><p>humanitarian supplies to both northern and southern Iraq and </p><p>to offer medical treatment for war wounded in Turkish </p><p>hospitals in Silopi, Diyarbakir and Ankara.  TRC contemplates </p><p>one six-truck convoy for Basra (via Syria or Jordan) to </p><p>deliver water and medicine, and another six-truck convey for </p><p>the north (probably Erbil) to ship medicines and food.  TRC, </p><p>working with the Anatolia Foundation NGO and Americare, would </p><p>provide supplies and transport.  The municipality of Izmit, </p><p>which received Iraqi aid following the 1999 Marmara </p><p>earthquakes, is prepared to donate bottled water.  Gonen </p><p>explained that, following donations from NATO allies and NGOs </p><p>and given the lack of a refugee crisis on the Turkish </p><p>frontier, Turkey has some surplus items which are urgently </p><p>needed in Iraq.  Gonen said TRC staff were available to </p><p>travel to Iraq to perform needs assessments.  He asked that </p><p>the USG provide security for convoys. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Gonen and Ugdul stated that TRC wished to coordinate </p><p>its efforts with the ICRC and emphasized that the GOT had no </p><p>intention of making a unilateral aid delivery.  Ugdul stated </p><p>that Turkey felt the need to reciprocate for Iraq\'s help </p><p>following Turkey\'s earthquakes, and raised Turkey\'s interest </p><p>in the well-being of Iraq\'s Turcoman minority (while </p><p>emphasizing that Turkish aid would be made available to all </p><p>in need regardless of ethnic origin).  Feza Ozturk, MFA </p><p>Department Head for International Political Organizations, </p><p>added that the Turkish authorities and TRC are under </p><p>considerable political pressure to demonstrate to the public </p><p>that they are responding to humanitarian needs in Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Ozturk pointed out that in the center and south, </p><p>families had received advance rations of food through July, </p><p>but that in the north, most families had received the </p><p>equivalent of only a few weeks advance rations.  The World </p><p>Food Program has requested MFA permission to ship food items, </p><p>most recently for a shipment of 56,000 tons of commodities to </p><p>be purchased in Turkey as well as imported from abroad, to </p><p>northern Iraq for this reason.  Ozturk suggested that there </p><p>is an inconsistency in the way Turkish Red Crescent and the </p><p>NGOs are perceived outside Turkey in that TRC is required to </p><p>coordinate its activities abroad with ICRC, while NGOs appear </p><p>to be entitled to operate freely in Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Ruda responded that ICRC had to be careful to </p><p>preserve neutrality and independence in order to be able to </p><p>deliver emergency aid wherever it is needed in Iraq.  Noting </p><p>recent incidents involving the Kuwaiti and United Arab </p><p>Emirates\' Societies, Ruda emphasized the security risks for </p><p>societies operating independently of the ICRC, and stressed </p><p>that ICRC would not sanction or assist with security for </p><p>national societies which act unilaterally.  Noting that </p><p>national societies and the ICRC had met April 6 in Abu Dhabi </p><p>on these issues, Ruda stated that ICRC is interested in </p><p>integrating aid from societies in neighboring states as the </p><p>security situation permits.  He stated that the societies and </p><p>ICRC agreed to establish an information link between the </p><p>Iraqi and Syrian Red Crescent which would pass information on </p><p>humanitarian needs to the other participants.  National </p><p>societies should route any assistance through ICRC hubs in </p><p>Damascus and Kuwait.  At the hubs, ICRC would coordinate with </p><p>both the GOI and CENTCOM on the logistics of delivering the </p><p>relief.  Goods would have to be reloaded to ICRC trucks.  In </p><p>the future, the combatants may accept direct relief from </p><p>national societies, but this is not now the case, said Ruda. </p><p>Ruda stated that he would report Turkey\'s offer to ICRC </p><p>headquarters, and that he had invited the ICRC\'s "Movement </p><p>Coordinator" in Iraq to come to Turkey to discuss the Turkish </p><p>proposal. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) Ruda stated that, while gaps in medical supplies </p><p>were beginning to appear, the food situation was largely in </p><p>hand.  ICRC had still not used up its prepositioned stocks of </p><p>medicines, including materials for 7,000 war wounded.  He </p><p>implied that the humanitarian situation was not so urgent as </p><p>to obviate the requirement to properly coordinate relief from </p><p>national societies through ICRC. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) Econ Counselor welcomed Turkey\'s offer to provide </p><p>assistance, but agreed that relief shipments needed to be </p><p>properly coordinated.  He said he would report Turkey\'s offer </p><p>to the Department and to CENTCOM, but cautioned that the U.S. </p><p>military was not likely to be able to provide direct security </p><p>for TRC convoys. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Comment and Action Request </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Embassy believes that Turkey\'s offer is largely </p><p>motivated by domestic political considerations and the fact </p><p>that a displaced persons emergency on or near Turkey\'s border </p><p>has not materialized.  The GOT and TRC have already begun to </p><p>return staff which had been deployed to crisis centers in </p><p>Diyarbakir back to Ankara.  Embassy would appreciate </p><p>Washington guidance, as requested reftel, as to whether and </p><p>how the U.S. military will restrict and/or coordinate NGO </p><p>access and/or activities in northern Iraq. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
