<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 BEIRUT 01676 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, PREL, LE </p><p>SUBJECT:  CHRISTIAN DECISION MOVEMENT RESPONDS TO </p><p>CONTINUING SYRIA PRESSURE </p><p> </p><p>REF:  FBIS NICOSIA 17 MARCH 85 </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  THE FOCUS OF SYRIAN PRESSURE ON DISSIDENT </p><p>CHRISTIANS HAS SHIFTED TO THE POLITICAL ARENA </p><p>AND THE USE OF LEBANESE MUSLIM LEADERS.  SYRIAN </p><p>VICE PRESIDENT KHADDAM HAS CANCELLED HIS </p><p>MARCH 18 VISIT TO BEIRUT. THE WEEKLY WEDNESDAY </p><p>MEETING OF THE LEBANESE CABINET HAS ALSO BEEN </p><p>POSTPONED BECAUSE MINISTERS JUMBLATT AND BARRI </p><p>WOULD NOT ATTEND.  JUMBLATT IS IN MOSCOW, </p><p>WHILE BARRI CLAIMS THAT THE ROAD TO BAABDA IS </p><p>UNSAFE.  THE IMPLICATION IS THAT THE ROAD </p><p>WILL NOT BE SAFE UNTIL THE CHRISTIAN DISSIDENTS </p><p>ARE BROUGHT INTO LINE.  IN A SPEECH IN MUKHTARA </p><p>SUNDAY TO COMMEMORATE THE EIGHTH ANNIVERSARY </p><p>OF THE ASSASSINATION OF KAMEL JUMBLATT, WALID </p><p>JUMBLATT URGED HIS SUPPORTERS TO REASON FOR </p><p>A POSSIBLE NEW ROUND OF FIGHTING.  HE THREATENED </p><p>TO "BREAK THE NECKS" OF THE CHRISTIAN REBELS. </p><p>AT A PRESS CONFERENCE SCHEDULED FOR LATE </p><p>TODAY (3/18), BARRI IS EXPECTED TO STEP UP THE </p><p>POLITICAL PRESSURE AGAINST JA\'JA"S CHRISTIAN </p><p>DECISION MOVEMENT (CDM). </p><p> </p><p>3.  IN THE FACE OF THIS CONTINUING PRESSURE, </p><p>RECONCILIATION EFFORTS CONTINUE WITHIN THE </p><p>CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY.  A TRIPARTITE COMMITTEE </p><p>COMPOSED OF MINISTER OF PUBLIC HEALTH  JOSEPH </p><p>AL-HASLEM, FORMER MINISTER AND PHALANGE POLITICAL </p><p>ALLY MICHEL AL-MURR, AND CDM EMERGENCY COMMITTEE </p><p>MEMBER KARIM PAKRADOUNI HAS BEEN MEETING TO </p><p>DRAFT A POLITICAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE FACTIONS. </p><p>L\'ORIENT-LE JOUR REPORTS THAT THIS COMMITTEE </p><p>HAS SUCCEEDED IN HAMMERING OUT THE OUTLINES OF </p><p>AN AGREEMENT BASED ON THE FOLLOWING POINTS: </p><p> </p><p>-  KEEPING CURRENT LEADERS IN PLACE </p><p> </p><p>-  RESTRUCTURING THE PHALANGE PARTY </p><p> </p><p>-  CLARIFYING RELATIONS BETWEEN THE PHALANGE AND THE LF </p><p> </p><p>-  MAINTAINING THE AUTONOMY OF THE LF </p><p> </p><p>-  PUSHING FOR THE RAPID CREATION OF A CHRISTIAN </p><p>NATIONAL COUNCIL </p><p> </p><p>DETAILS OF THE AGREEMENT HAVE NOT BEEN RELEASED </p><p>PENDING THE MARCH 18 MEETING OF THE PHALANGE </p><p>PARTY POLITICAL BUREAU. </p><p> </p><p>4.  IN A MARCH 17 PRESS CONFERENCE HELD IN </p><p>JOUNIEH, PAKRADOUNI TRIED TO PRESENT THE CDM </p><p>IN A MANNER WHICH WOULD ALLAY SYRIAN CONCERNS. </p><p>REFTEL PROVIDES THE TEXT OF THE CONFERENCE. </p><p>FOLLOWING ARE THE MAJOR POINTS: </p><p> </p><p>A.  CDM\'S MAJOR PRINCIPLES ARE 1)  SUPPORT FOR </p><p>THE UNITY OF LEBANON AND ITS FULL LIBERATION; 2) </p><p>SUPPORT FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A NEW FORMULA </p><p>FOR MUSLIM-CHRISTIAN RELATIONS;  AND 3) ACTION </p><p>TO GUARANTEE THE SECURITY OF THE CHRISTIAN </p><p>COMMUNITY. </p><p> </p><p>B.  CDM\'S "UPPERMOST OBJECTIVE" IS THE SPEEDY </p><p>ELECTION OF A NATIONAL CHRISTIAN COUNCIL TO </p><p>SERVE AS A CHRISTIAN PARLIAMENT. </p><p> </p><p>C.  CDM HAS RECEIVED NO AID FROM ISRAEL.  HOWEVER, </p><p>PAKRADOUNI QUALIFIED THIS DENIAL BY ADDING, </p><p>"THE COLLECTIVE LEADERSHIP HAS NOT YET DECIDED </p><p>ITS POLICY TOWARD ISRAEL." </p><p> </p><p>D.  CDM DOES NOT INTEND TO HARM THE PRESIDENT OR </p><p>THE PRESIDENCY.  HE STATED, "WE WANT THE </p><p>PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC TO REMAIN ABOVE PARTY </p><p>AND SECTARIAN DISPUTES.  WE WANT HIM TO BE THE </p><p>PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC-OF ALL LEBANON- AND </p><p>WE DO NOT WANT HIM TO BE MERELY THE PRESIDENT OF </p><p>THE CHRISTIANS OR OF MILITIAS." </p><p> </p><p>E.  CDM IS A "COUP" WITHIN THE LF AND THE PHALANGE </p><p>PARTY AIMED AT MAKING THE CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY </p><p>MORE DEMOCRATIC. </p><p> </p><p>F.  CDM SEEKS DIRECT MUSLIM-CHRISTIAN NEGOTIATIONS, </p><p>ESPECIALLY WITH MINISTERS BARRI AND JUMBLATT, </p><p>AIMING TOWARD A "PEACEFUL CO-EXISTENCE CHARTER." </p><p> </p><p>G.  CONTACTS WITH THE SYRIANS WILL CONTINUE. </p><p>PAKRADOUNI WILL MAKE A THIRD CALL TO SYRIAN VP </p><p>KHADDAM.  FURTHER, HE STATED THAT HIS "COMMUNICATIONS </p><p>WITH SYRIAN OFFICIALS PERMIT ME TO SAY THAT THERE </p><p>WILL BE NO SYRIAN INCURSION INTO OUR AREAS." </p><p> </p><p>H.  CDM OPPOSES THE REMOVAL OF THE BARBARA </p><p>CHECKPOINT. </p><p> </p><p>5.  COMMENT:  IT IS INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT </p><p>THE CDM ORIGINALLY CRITICIZED PRESIDENT GEMAYEL </p><p>FOR DEALING WITH THE SYRIANS AND FOR MAKING </p><p>CONCESSIONS AS PRESIDENT THAT HE WOULD NOT HAVE </p><p>MADE AS A STRICTLY CHRISTIAN LEADER.  NOW, </p><p>FACED WITH THE POLITICAL REALITIES OF </p><p>THEIR SITUATION, THE CDM LEADERSHIP IS BOTH </p><p>DEALING DIRECTLY WITH THE SYRIANS AND ENCOURAGING </p><p>PRESIDENT GEMAYEL TO REMAIN ABOVE THE SECTARIAN </p><p>FRAY.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>6.  ADDITIONAL INFORMATION HAS ALSO SURFACED </p><p>CONCERNING THE STATUS OF TITULAR LF COMMANDER </p><p>FUAD ABU NADER.  IN HIS PRESS CONFERENCE, </p><p>PAKRADOUNI ASSERTED THAT, "FUAD ABU NADER IS </p><p>STILL THE COMMANDER OF THE LEBANESE FORCES. </p><p>HE HAS SUPPORTED IN AN OFFICIAL STATEMENT THE </p><p>POLICY OF THE UPRISING WITHIN THE LEBANESE </p><p>FORCES.  A TEMPORARY COLLECTIVE LEADERSHIP </p><p>CALLED THE \'EMERGENCY COMMITTEE\' HAS BEEN </p><p>FORMED.  WE WILL SOON ANNOUNCE A NEW LEADERSHIP </p><p>FOR THIS COMMITTEE."  ABU NADER IS THUS STILL </p><p>FUNCTIONING AS A LEADER OF THE LF, THOUGH THE </p><p>DEGREE OF HIS PRESENT INFLUENCE AND HIS FUTURE </p><p>PROSPECTS REMAIN UNCLEAR. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BARTHOLOMEW </p><p></p></div>
