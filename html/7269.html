<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 002292 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, P, EUR/SE AND EB </p><p>TREASURY FOR U/S TAYLOR AND OASIA - MILLS </p><p>NSC FOR QUANRUD AND BRYZA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/02/2006 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY\'S ECONOMY APRIL 9:  NEWS OF U.S. AID </p><p>"CONDITIONALITY" DAMPENS MARKET MOOD; TREASURY CHIEF UNDER </p><p>PRESSSURE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 2258 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Econ Counselor Scot Marciel for reasons 1.5 (b, </p><p>d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Markets - U.S. Senate "Conditionality" A </p><p>Negative Surprise </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) On April 9 am, in the first trading session for the </p><p>new T-bill issued yesterday, volume was quite high - TL 1.1 </p><p>quadrillion ($670 million).  Rates, however, did not decline </p><p>as expected.   Traders cited the local press reports that the </p><p>Senate version of the U.S. aid for Turkey contains a </p><p>condition that Turkey not intervene in Northern Iraq, a </p><p>condition that the GOT is bound to contest, per some market </p><p>contacts. </p><p>--  T-bill yields rose about 0.5 percent to 63.5 percent </p><p>compounded. </p><p>--  The lira depreciated slightly to TL 1,647,000; </p><p>--  The Istanbul Stock Exchange closed down 2.4 percent in </p><p>morning trading. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Treasury Undersecretary Personally Unhappy, But </p><p>Still Sees Positive Prospects for the Economy </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Treasury Undersecretary Faik Oztrak, whom local press </p><p>is speculating will be replaced shortly (reftel), was clearly </p><p>unhappy in his April 8 meeting with Econ Counselor.  Oztrak </p><p>began by noting the Government\'s continuing credibility </p><p>problem in the financial markets.  "This government doesn\'t </p><p>understand," he said citing as an example PM Erdogan\'s April </p><p>8 meeting with AK parliamentary deputies.  Erdogan gave a </p><p>good statement about this GOT\'s determination to continue the </p><p>reform program started by the prior government.   But then, </p><p>per Oztrak, Erdogan also said this GOT will restructure state </p><p>bank Ziraat\'s loans to farmers (note:  news reports say </p><p>Erdogan offered to extend overdue debts for three years or </p><p>slash debts by 30 percent if repaid in lump sums.)  This </p><p>populist signaling undercuts the GOT\'s tough fiscal measures, </p><p>and makes it harder to reduce interest rates on GOT debt, </p><p>Oztrak said. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Moving to his situation, Oztrak said the Government </p><p>doesn\'t ask his advice on personnel appointments, including </p><p>the recent state bank board appointments, even though the </p><p>Treasury oversees the state banks.  Oztrak would have advised </p><p>against replacing the entire state bank board at this </p><p>sensitive time.  Furthermore, Oztrak said he doubted he would </p><p>go to Washington for the spring Bank and Fund meetings.  He </p><p>was invited to address a JP Morgan seminar in Washington, but </p><p>Babacan had balked, saying Oztrak needed Prime Ministerial </p><p>approval to talk at this seminar.  "I told Minister Babacan I </p><p>don\'t want to be a lame duck Treasury Undersecretary.  Either </p><p>I have full responsibility and authority or they appoint </p><p>someone else." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Oztrak said he would given a positive portrayal in </p><p>Washington.  The government had put forth a strong budget and </p><p>is implementing it.  Turkey\'s economy is very resilient and </p><p>responds quickly to reforms.   Furthermore, if the GOT </p><p>maintains its partial spending freeze (about TL 4 </p><p>quadrillion) until the fourth quarter, it will be able to </p><p>finance itself at lower rates.  The TL 4 quadrillion will </p><p>help reduce the market roll-over rates for Turkey\'s debt to </p><p>75 percent (from current 85-90 percent).  As roll-over </p><p>demands start to decrease, Treasury will calibrate the supply </p><p>of new debt issuances to ensure a gradually decreasing </p><p>interest rates on these securities.  Under conservative </p><p>projections of the new interest rate path, and also assuming </p><p>Turkey uses the U.S. loan package to help service domestic </p><p>debt, the net public sector debt to GNP ratio should decline </p><p>to 73 percent by year-end 2003 (from nearly 80 percent at </p><p>year-end 2003).  In addition, the composition of the holders </p><p>of Turkey\'s domestic debt is changing -  about one third of </p><p>the marketable part of the domestic debt is held by the </p><p>public (both individuals and corporations) and they are "less </p><p>fickle and longer-term investors" than the Turkish banks or </p><p>mutual funds.  This provides a measure of stability, Oztrak </p><p>observed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Comment:  Oztrak\'s optimistic picture is certainly </p><p>possible, but it is premised on gradually declining interest </p><p>rates which in turn requires the GOT to restore its </p><p>credibility in the markets. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
