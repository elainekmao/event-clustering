(A) HARARE 2529 </p><p> </p><p>     B. (B) HARARE 2496 </p><p>     C. (C) HARARE 2403 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: JOSEPH G. SULLIVAN FOR REASONS 1.5B/D </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary:  The suspension of international food deliveries </p><p>to two locations, GOZ foot-dragging in the GOZ\'s dealings </p><p>with international donors and documented reports of </p><p>politicization of GOZ-controlled food stocks provides ample </p><p>proof that the GOZ continues to place ZANU-PF political </p><p>interests ahead of the well-being of the Zimbabwean </p><p>population.  Ex-commercial farm workers have been especially </p><p>hard hit by this cynical policy.  UNSYG Kofi Annan has been </p><p>at the forefront of growing international condemnation of GOZ </p><p>manipulation of food as a political tool.  Barring other </p><p>effective leverage to move the Mugabe Government from its </p><p>current course, we think the best USG tactic would be to push </p><p>for a UNSC session that focuses on the humanitarian emergency </p><p>in Zimbabwe.  Using this platform to highlight GOZ efforts to </p><p>politicize food delivery might be the best way to pressure </p><p>the GOZ into getting more food to the neediest Zimbabweans, </p><p>irrespective of political considerations. End Summary </p><p> </p><p>GOZ Efforts to Politicize International Food Assistance </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) GOZ response to the country\'s humanitarian emergency </p><p>continues to place the well-being of its own people secondary </p><p>to the interests of the ruling ZANU-PF.  It is still largely </p><p>true that international food assistance has not been diverted </p><p>for political purposes because of objective World Food </p><p>Program(WFP) controls over, and NGO  implementation of, food </p><p>distribution.  The two most significant exceptions to this </p><p>have been in the extremely poor district of Binga in </p><p>Matabeleland North, where war veterans and government </p><p>officials have cut off food deliveries on two occasions in </p><p>the last six months.  The most recent cutoff came after Binga </p><p>residents voted in favor of the opposition MDC in rural </p><p>council elections and has already persisted almost eight </p><p>weeks. Only twelve days after the Government told donors that </p><p>Save the Children(UK) would be authorized to resume food </p><p>distribution in Binga did Minister July Moyo sign the </p><p>document authorizing this resumption.  In Insiza district in </p><p>Matabeleland South, seizure of WFP food by ZANU-PF militants </p><p>in the course of a parliamentary bi-election campaign led to </p><p>a WFP cutoff of food deliveries to the district, and all </p><p>subsequent discussions have failed to secure Government </p><p>agreement to recognize the fault, replace the stolen three </p><p>metric tons of food and provide  assurances for the future </p><p>that would be necessary for WFP to resume food deliveries. </p><p> </p><p>Other GOZ (In)Actions Slowing International Food Assistance </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.(C) Of greater overall impact in limiting the amount of </p><p>food assistance has been the GOZ\'s slow response to the WFP </p><p>and international donors.  The GOZ insisted on a laborious </p><p>NGO registration of or, in many cases, re-authorization </p><p>process for NGO\'s to be able to carry out food distribution </p><p>for the WFP or bilaterally.  This clearance process included </p><p>rigorous and time-consuming Central Intelligence Organization </p><p>clearances that so slowed the ability of NGO\'s to staff up </p><p>and organize as to assure that WFP will be unable to meet its </p><p>target distribution of 55,000 metric tons by the most </p><p>critical months of November and December.  On top of this has </p><p>been the GOZ\'s divided and protracted response to the GM/BT </p><p>food issue.  Following the mid-July letter to USAID A/A </p><p>Winter from Labor and Social Affairs Minister July Moyo </p><p>accepting US yellow maize through a swap arrangement, </p><p>different Ministers of the GOZ flip-flopped several times on </p><p>the issue before taking a Cabinet decision in early September </p><p>to accept GM/BT maize.  Even then, the Agriculture </p><p>Ministry/Grain Marketing Board (GMB) seems to have </p><p>slow-tracked the formal agreement with GMB for about four </p><p>weeks. Thereafter, the issue of labeling donated maize raised </p><p>by the Bio-safety Board cost additional time, but the Board </p><p>demonstrated substantial flexibility in addressing this </p><p>issue.  Nonetheless, it is only now that we are at the point </p><p>of having US maize distributed through WFP channels, many </p><p>months after this could have happened. </p><p> </p><p>GOZ Intentions and Explanations </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) We know from inside sources that the GOZ has the </p><p>intention to manipulate international food assistance for its </p><p>partisan political benefit, although we believe that WFP </p><p>controls have minimized the GOZ\'s ability to achieve this </p><p>goal.  We also know that the GOZ intends to maintain GOZ/GMB </p><p>predominance in delivering food to the population so that it </p><p>can distribute GMB food in a way which benefits ZANU/PF\'s </p><p>political agenda.  GOZ  limitations on, and delays in </p><p>international food assistance coming into the country served </p><p>GOZ objectives to maintain GMB predominance in food delivery </p><p>to the population and concomitantly, the population\'s </p><p>dependence on the Government.  Because of the slow startup in </p><p>international assistance, only now is the balance beginning </p><p>to shift toward an international food assistance balance of </p><p>close to half the basic food deliveries to the population. </p><p>In addition, of course, the GOZ has maintained its adamant </p><p>position of taking no steps to facilitate the private </p><p>sector\'s ability to alleviate the food shortage, which would </p><p>diminish by definition the GOZ\'s ability to use food as a </p><p>weapon. </p><p> </p><p>5.(C) The GOZ has utilized obfuscation, delay and outright </p><p>lies to mask its actions and objectives.  Foreign Minister </p><p>Mudenge, for example, told his South African counterpart at </p><p>the recent binational commission meetings that the Insiza </p><p>incident was caused by ZANU-PF militants\' reaction to an MDC </p><p>conspiracy with the distributing ORAP NGO to divert the WFP </p><p>food to MDC supporters -- this notwithstanding his having in </p><p>hand WFP documentation of ZANU-PF seizure of food with police </p><p>complicity.  Minister July Moyo was only a bit less </p><p>duplicitous in dealing with donors on the Insiza issue in </p><p>claiming that it was the result of a complex set of two-sided </p><p>political arm-wrestling and therefore did not merit an </p><p>unambiguous WFP or Government response. </p><p> </p><p>GOZ manipulation of its own Food Distribution </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.(C) With respect to Government-purchased food, the GOZ has </p><p>been blatant in its politicization of GMB food.  Since food </p><p>is sold at a highly subsidized and readily affordable price, </p><p>the key issues are where this food is delivered and who has </p><p>the right to purchase it.  It is not true that the </p><p>Matabeleland or the cities -- all MDC strongholds -- have </p><p>been deprived of all Government food, but the ability of WFP </p><p>or the international community to track the fairness of GOZ </p><p>food distribution has been quite limited.  Instead, we have </p><p>some documentation from Zimbabwean organizations of the </p><p>degree to which individual communities are benefited (such as </p><p>Insiza) or prejudiced, depending on their support for ZANU. </p><p>We also have frequent accounts of those seeking to buy food </p><p>being required to produce ZANU membership cards or other </p><p>proof of ZANU loyalty in order to purchase GMB maize.  In </p><p>discussing these issues with international donors, the GOZ </p><p>has been anything but transparent.  Notwithstanding President </p><p>Mugabe\'s pledge to WFP Director Morris in September that all </p><p>food of whatever provenance should be distributed on a </p><p>non-partisan basis, the GOZ has never  coordinated GMB </p><p>deliveries effectively with the WFP.  Minister July Moyo </p><p>handles this issue cleverly in his meetings with donors, </p><p>acknowledging that "some" politicization and corruption </p><p>occurs, but claims it to be contrary to policy.  He even </p><p>invites donors to report any problems to him, knowing that </p><p>such verification efforts are beyond the capacity of the UN </p><p>and the donors. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Ex-Commercial Farm Workers Largely Ignored </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>7.(C) As reported in ref c, the GOZ has shown virtually no </p><p>genuine interest in assisting former commercial farm workers </p><p>with food or humanitarian assistance, although it has </p><p>recently submitted a formal request to the UN to assist in </p><p>providing assistance to this group, although not as a </p><p>privileged group.  In fact, the GOZ has participated in the </p><p>massive dislocation of this group, often to the fringes and </p><p>most desolate parts of the country.  Commercial farm workers </p><p>are understandably intimidated and reluctant to identify </p><p>themselves.  Efforts by the UN and this Embassy to interview </p><p>displaced and needy commercial farm workers on the outskirts </p><p>of Harare were met by violent intervention of war veterans </p><p>(ref A), whose actions the GOZ has yet to repudiate or </p><p>punish. </p><p>International Reaction to Politicization of Food Assistance </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) The US and other donors and the WFP and the UN, </p><p>including the UNSYG, have spoken out on numerous occasions </p><p>against the politicization of food assistance.  The most </p><p>recent statement was by UNSYG Kofi Annan last week when he </p><p>endorsed the WFP policy against the politicization of food </p><p>assistance.  "The Secretary General notes the continuing </p><p>reports of politicization in food distribution and </p><p>humanitarian assistance in general."  "Those distributing aid </p><p>have an obligation to ensure that it is given to </p><p>beneficiaries based on their needs and not upon political </p><p>affiliation"  "The Secretary General fully supports the zero </p><p>tolerance policy on the politicization of food distribution </p><p>established by the World Food Program." " He appeals to the </p><p>Government of Zimbabwe to ensure that political </p><p>considerations do not affect food aid efforts within the </p><p>country."    With donor assistance, the UN has established an </p><p>OCHA position to identify and assist needy ex-commercial farm </p><p>workers and another Unit to verify that food assistance is </p><p>reaching the neediest Zimbabweans and to examine allegations </p><p>of improper distribution of food assistance. The UN believes </p><p>it has the mandate to examine distribution of food provided </p><p>by the WFP, that provided bilaterally, and also that provided </p><p>by the GOZ.  Comment: We think the first two mandates are </p><p>achievable and will help relieve the pressures from several </p><p>sides on the NGO\'s carrying out food distribution.  However, </p><p>the UN will be very hard pressed in the face of likely </p><p>minimal cooperation from the GOZ to constrain continued </p><p>Government politicization of its own food deliveries. </p><p>Similarly, as exemplified in the previous para, UN and our </p><p>efforts on the ground to find and assist ex-commercial farm </p><p>workers will be difficult in the face of Government </p><p>disinterest and active measures to the contrary. </p><p> </p><p>Comment: What to do ? </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. Some local NGO\'s have proposed cutting off all food </p><p>deliveries in retaliation for GOZ political manipulation of </p><p>food.  Other NGO\'s and some political opposition leaders have </p><p>proposed massive flooding of the country with food.  Both of </p><p>these options sound attractive, but are unlikely to be </p><p>effective in practice.  Cutting off all international food </p><p>assistance would only make the situation of the population </p><p>more desperate and would be unlikely to motivate the GOZ to </p><p>change its behavior.  Instead, the GOZ\'s ability to  control </p><p>to whom and under what conditions even scarcer food would be </p><p>accentuated and the GOZ would be quick to blame the </p><p>international community for resulting famine among those who </p><p>are not ruling party supporters.  Flooding the country with </p><p>food would only be possible through use of force(unlikely) or </p><p>by securing greater government cooperation by providing the </p><p>food for distribution directly by the </p><p>government(undesirable.) </p><p> </p><p>Comment continued: UNSC Focus on Humanitarian </p><p>Assistance to Zimbabwe </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. While we defer to experts on the limits of the possible, </p><p>we assume, based on similar experiences with respect to </p><p>Angola, that it would be possible to have a UNSC session </p><p>convened to focus on the humanitarian emergency in Zimbabwe </p><p>(if necessary, as part of a broader examination of the </p><p>Southern African emergency.  At such a session, the UN </p><p>Secretariat, OCHA, WFP and others could be called upon to </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>report on the dimensions of the humanitarian emergency and </p><p>efforts to deal with it.  One of the issues which should </p><p>receive ample focus at such a conference should be GOZ </p><p>efforts to politicize food delivery, and what needs be done </p><p>by the GOZ to provide food for all its citizens on the basis </p><p>of need rather than political criteria.  We would assume that </p><p>a UNSC statement or resolution which focused on this problem </p><p>in a clear way would be achievable, even if outright </p><p>condemnation of GOZ practices would be unlikely.  While less </p><p>than a "home run," there would be some positive impact to </p><p>such an outcome.  Most importantly, the GOZ would be likely </p><p>to seek to clean up its act, perhaps even in advance of a </p><p>UNSC session, in an effort to avoid condemnation, thus </p><p>helping more food get to more of the people who most need it. </p><p>The UNSC action would also provide a point of continuing </p><p>reference to press for future GOZ cooperation and </p><p>non-politicization of humanitarian assistance.  Finally, the </p><p>UNSC discussion and eventual statement would help make it </p><p>clear to Zimbabweans and the world that GOZ politicization of </p><p>food to its own citizens was a fact, and one of serious </p><p>international concern. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
