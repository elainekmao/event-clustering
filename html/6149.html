<p>UNCLAS ANKARA 001442 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, P, EUR/SE AND EB </p><p>TREASURY FOR U/S TAYLOR AND OASIA - MILLS </p><p>NSC FOR QUANRUD AND BRYZA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY\'S ECONOMY MARCH 6 AM: MARKETS STABLE, </p><p>ERDOGAN HINTS AT BUDGET RELIEF FROM U.S. PACKAGE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but unclassified, and not for internet </p><p>distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary:  Turkish financial markets were flat during the </p><p>morning of March 6, awaiting confirmation of their </p><p>expectation that a new GOT, led by AK Chairman Erdogan, would </p><p>deliver a U.S. financial package.  Erdogan and State Minister </p><p>Babacan, facing public complaints about the new taxes in the </p><p>draft 2003 budget, hinted that a U.S. package would be used </p><p>to ease fiscal restraints.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Markets In Waiting Mode </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) On Thursday morning March 6, Turkish financial </p><p>markets were flat.  Turkish investors told us market </p><p>expectations of a U.S. financial package continue, and </p><p>underpin the current relative state of calm.  Some foreign </p><p>hedge funds sold off on Monday, March 3 (JP Morgan/Chase </p><p>trader Gumisdis told us the house account sold off Monday in </p><p>"stop loss" transactions.)  But some amount of foreign hedge </p><p>fund money is still in the market, given what some see as a </p><p>large upside potential if the U.S. package does come through. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  At mid-day March 6, Turkish T-bills were stable at 57 </p><p>percent compounded (having strengthened 5 percentage points </p><p>from March 4, but still two percentage points higher than </p><p>Friday, February 28 close). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  The lira was unchanged at TL 1,605,000 to the dollar. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  The Istanbul Stock Exchange was up 0.2 percent in light </p><p>trading in the morning. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Erdogan and Babacan Hint At </p><p>Budget Relief From U.S. Package </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) In separate comments to the press March 4 and 5 AK </p><p>Chairman Erdogan and MinState in Charge of Treasury Babacan </p><p>hinted that a U.S. package would be used to ease the fiscal </p><p>measures announced by PM Gul on March 3. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  On March 4, Erdogan spoke to journalists in Istanbul </p><p>outside a court where he was giving testimony.  Asked if a </p><p>second parliamentary resolution would lead the GOT to revise </p><p>its just released 2003 budget, Erdogan said (per Embassy\'s </p><p>unofficial translation):  "The draft budget, which takes into </p><p>consideration measures needed under the current conditions, </p><p>is the prepared budget.  What would you do under </p><p>extraordinary circumstances?  You could provide a </p><p>supplemental budget.  If developments move in an optimistic </p><p>direction, the government could make a surprise." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  In a March 5 TV interview with Mehmet Ali Birand, Babacan </p><p>was asked about Erdogan\'s comments.  Babacan, according to </p><p>the daily Milliyet March 6, replied that Chairman Erdogan\'s </p><p>statements were consistent with GOT plans.  The loan portion </p><p>of the U.S. financial package would be used to restructure </p><p>government debt.  The grant portion, however, would be used </p><p>to support current budget expenditures, he said. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Comment:  IMF Resrep pointed to these press </p><p>statements as evidence of his view that this government might </p><p>reluctantly agree with reform conditionality, but in </p><p>practical terms it plans to use any U.S. package to get away </p><p>from implementing the IMF program. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
