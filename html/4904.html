<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ADANA 0436 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINS, PGOV, PHUM, TU, IZ, Press Summaries, ADANA </p><p>SUBJECT:  SOUTHEAST TURKEY PRESS SUMMARY, </p><p>DEC 28-29, 2002 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  This is the Southeastern Turkey press summary </p><p>for December 28-29, 2002.  Please note that Turkish </p><p>press reports often contain errors or </p><p>exaggerations; AmConsulate Adana does not vouch for </p><p>the accuracy of the reports summarized here. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>POLITICS, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  WAR PREPARATIONS IN THE SOUTHEAST </p><p>(Hurriyet/Sabah/Turkiye/Evrensel)  While countdown </p><p>for the possible U.S. operation against Iraq </p><p>continues, Turkey has intensified its preparations </p><p>along the (Iraqi) border.  U.S. soldiers to be </p><p>deployed in Turkey will stay with the Silopi </p><p>(Sirnak) Tank Battalion, where they stayed during </p><p>the (1991) Gulf War.  Walls around the battalion </p><p>are being heightened.  Industrial sites are being </p><p>prepared for military purposes.  War and terror </p><p>concerns on the part of Americans at Incirlik </p><p>(Adana) Air Base have affected Incirlik merchants, </p><p>with Americans stopping shopping.  Turkiye reported </p><p>Turkey plans to establish a total of eleven camps </p><p>in northern Iraq against a possible influx of </p><p>refugees in the wake of the U.S. operation. </p><p>Infrastructure projects for these camps have </p><p>already begun.  Hakkari Governor Orhan Isin said </p><p>his office would prepare and administer two of the </p><p>camps.  Milli Gazete points to increased military </p><p>activities along the Iraqi and Syrian border, with </p><p>security measures elevated.  Siverek (Sanliurfa) </p><p>people have reportedly begun to stockpile </p><p>foodstuffs prior to the operation.  Radikal quoted </p><p>Abdullah Sevinc of the municipality of Diyarbakir </p><p>as stating that former underground shelters in the </p><p>province have been converted into car parks, </p><p>underground shopping centers, coffee houses or </p><p>sports centers, creating a potential problem for </p><p>the future. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  USED GAS MASKS ON THE MARKET </p><p>(Hurriyet)  Gas masks, distributed to U.S. soldiers </p><p>at Adana\'s Incirlik Air Base during the 1991 Gulf </p><p>War, have taken their places in shop windows. </p><p>Masks sell at TL 40 million (approx. USD 25) each. </p><p>With merchants trying to turn the war danger into </p><p>profit, experts said citizens should know that </p><p>these masks might not work in case of a chemical </p><p>weapons attack. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  VARIOUS ANTI-WAR STATEMENTS </p><p>(Evrensel)  Adana Pharmacists Association President </p><p>Erdogan Colak voiced opposition to the possible </p><p>U.S. against Iraq, saying, "Why are we being pulled </p><p>into this war, which no one in Turkey, other than </p><p>the U.S. Ambassador, wants?"  Selahattin Demirtas, </p><p>President of the Diyarbakir chapter of the Human </p><p>Rights Association (HRA), said an anti-war platform </p><p>would be formed in Diyarbakir, which the paper </p><p>reported the U.S. wanted to use as an attack </p><p>center, in the upcoming days.  Demirtas said that, </p><p>over time, Diyarbakir might turn into the center of </p><p>anti-war struggles.  Islamist-oriented Independent </p><p>Industrialists and Businessmen\'s Association </p><p>(MUSIAD) Malatya President Selahattin Asan warned </p><p>the price of Turkey\'s involvement in the war would </p><p>be very high.  Hurriyet quoted Iskenderun (Hatay) </p><p>local administrators and businessmen as warning the </p><p>government to take solid steps with respect to the </p><p>possible war, as it would paralyze the Turkish </p><p>economy.  Milli Gazete reported the Antakya (Hatay) </p><p>chapter of the HRA and the Environmental Protection </p><p>Association staged an anti-war protest </p><p>demonstration, shouting anti-war slogans. </p><p>5.  SIX BISMIL (DIYARBAKIR) VILLAGE GUARDS RELEASED </p><p>(Evrensel)  The trial of ten village guards charged </p><p>with armed attack against two families who had </p><p>returned to Bismil\'s (Diyarbakir) Ugrak village and </p><p>killing three people and injuring four others began </p><p>in the Diyarbakir Felony Court (on December 27). </p><p>Eight of the defendants pleaded not guilty, </p><p>claiming they were not in the village when the </p><p>incident occurred.  Then, the court released six of </p><p>the defendants from custody and adjourned the trial </p><p>until a later date due to missing documents in the </p><p>case file. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  JANDARMA OFFICIALS CHARGED WITH TORTURE </p><p>(Evrensel)  The Batman Prosecutor\'s Office </p><p>initiated prosecution against two Besiri (Batman) </p><p>Jandarma Command officials for having tortured </p><p>three People\'s Democracy Party (HADEP) members </p><p>arrested during a May ID check for possession of </p><p>weapons.  The arrestees were reportedly subjected </p><p>to blindfolding, rough beating, pressurized water, </p><p>beating of the soles of the feet and psychological </p><p>pressure. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  MAYOR UNDER INVESTIGATION </p><p>(Evrensel)  An investigation has been launched </p><p>against Mardin\'s Derik district Mayor Ayse Karadag </p><p>for "participating in the inauguration ceremonies </p><p>of Democratic People\'s Party\'s (DEHAP) election </p><p>offices in Mardin, addressing the public and using </p><p>his official vehicle in election campaigns," </p><p>despite his political ban. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  PRO-OCALAN DEMONSTRATIONS </p><p>(Evrensel)  KADEK (PKK) leader Abdullah Ocalan\'s </p><p>isolation was protested in Adana, Izmir and </p><p>Gaziantep. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> 9.  TWENTY-ONE THOUSAND IRAQIS DEPORTED </p><p>(Evrensel)  According to the Habur (Sirnak) Customs </p><p>Directorate, 21,391 Iraqis arrested while trying to </p><p>illegally cross into Turkey over the past year have </p><p>been deported through the Habur border gate in </p><p>Silopi (Sirnak). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ECONOMIC AND AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENTS </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  SOUTHEASTERN AGRICULTURAL EXPORTS UP OVER 18% </p><p>(Evrensel)  According to the Southeastern Anatolia </p><p>Exporters\' Union, agricultural exports from the </p><p>Southeastern Anatolia Project (GAP) region to the </p><p>African continent increased 18.2% in the first </p><p>eleven months of the year, rising to USD 19.3 </p><p>million from USD 16.3 million for the same period </p><p>in 2001.  In the same period, USD 12.4 million of </p><p>textile, USD 5.1 million of grain, beans and seed </p><p>products and USD 1.7 million of dried fruits were </p><p>exported from the region. </p><p>HOLTZ </p><p></p></div>
