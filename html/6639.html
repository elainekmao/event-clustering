<p>UNCLAS GUATEMALA 000758 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, IZ, GT, UNSC, HNCHR-1 </p><p>SUBJECT: KEEPING THE IRAQ ISSUE IN THE SECURITY COUNCIL </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 74254 </p><p> </p><p>1.  In the absence of the Director General for Multilateral </p><p>Affairs, PolOff discussed reftel points with his assistant, </p><p>Sylvia Corado on March 21.  Corado said the MFA had </p><p>anticipated our position on this issue and agreed that the UN </p><p>Charter gives responsibility for international peace and </p><p>security to the UNSC.  She was noncommittal, however, to our </p><p>points that other UN bodies such as the General Assembly or </p><p>Commission on Human Rights would be inappropriate fora for </p><p>discussions on Iraq.  Corado said the Foreign Minister and </p><p>his Vice Ministers were consulting on our points, but </p><p>discussions were going slower than she would like due to the </p><p>Foreign Minister\'s travels.  Corado added that input from the </p><p>Guatemalan PermRep in New York would probably be decisive. </p><p>Corado could not comment on whether Guatemala would try to </p><p>influence the NAM to prevent efforts to introduce the Iraq </p><p>issue, but said she did not think the US had much to worry </p><p>about from the NAM. </p><p> </p><p>2.  FonMin Gutierrez has just returned from abroad and </p><p>Ambassador will endeavor to reach him. </p><p>HAMILTON </p><p></p></div>
