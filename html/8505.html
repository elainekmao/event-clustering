<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 KATHMANDU 001042 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA, SA/INS, EAP/CM, DRL-A/S CRANER, PRM </p><p>LONDON FOR SOUTH ASIA WATCH </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREF, PREL, NP, CH, Tibetan Refugees </p><p>SUBJECT: TIBETAN REFUGEE DEPORTATION: POST-MORTEM </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) SECSTATE 144931 (B) KATHMANDU 715 (C) </p><p> </p><p>     KATHMANDU 753 (D) KATHMANDU 984 (E) </p><p>     KATHMANDU 997 (F) KATHMANDU 998 (G) </p><p>     KATHMANDU 1018 </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>Summary </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Despite strenous efforts by the Embassy to dissuade it </p><p>from doing so, the Government of Nepal on May 31 deported 18 </p><p>Tibetan refugees to China. Th Mission began working this </p><p>issue in late April shortly after the refugees were first </p><p>detained.  Post pressed for the refugees\' release at all </p><p>levels of the Government of Nepal (GON), from the King down </p><p>to officials within the Home and Foreign Ministries, the </p><p>National Police and the Immigration Office.  On June 4, Home </p><p>Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Mandal as well as Foreign </p><p>Ministry Secretary Acharya gave strong assurances that the </p><p>deportation was a one-time occurrence and did not signify a </p><p>change in Nepal\'s official policy of allowing Tibetan </p><p>refugees to transit the country.  Acharya also confided that </p><p>the Chinese had exerted unusual pressure in this specific </p><p>case, confirmed our suspicion that the decision was made at </p><p>the highest level of government, and repeated with </p><p>resignation that the decision was one of the last made by the </p><p>outgoing government.  Post conveyed that the release of the </p><p>one remaining Tibetan refugee, who had arrived just days </p><p>after the group of 21 refugees, to UNHCR would go far to show </p><p>the West of Nepal\'s commitment to allow future Tibetans to </p><p>transit the country.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>Overview of Events </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) After the April 15 detention of 21 Tibetan refugees </p><p>(the 18 deported refugees plus 3 young children who were </p><p>later released to UNHCR) (Ref B), Ambassador Malinowski met </p><p>April 25 with Home Secretary Tikka Datta Niraula (Ref C) and </p><p>May 9 with King Gyanendra to press for the their release and </p><p>to convey the importance the U.S. places on the plight of the </p><p>Tibetan refugees. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) On May 29, the Embassy learned that the Department of </p><p>Immigration was preparing to hand over to Chinese Embassy </p><p>representatives 18 Tibetans detained on immigration </p><p>violations. Upon receipt of this information, Emboffs </p><p>contacted Home Ministry Joint Secretary Niranjan Baral to </p><p>stress the importance of abiding by internationally respected </p><p>norms and established practice.  Emboffs also contacted </p><p>Immigration Director Subarna Lal Shrestha, who suggested that </p><p>the deportation to China was "per our regulation," referred </p><p>Emboffs back to the Home Ministry.  EmbOffs, in a follow-up </p><p>call to Home Ministry Joint Secretary Baral, learned that the </p><p>international community\'s intervention, including that of the </p><p>U.S., had made the Ministry reconsider the matter (Ref D). </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) On May 30, Charge delivered Ref A demarche to Foreign </p><p>Secretary Madhu Raman Acharya, who denied that there had been </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>a change in GON policy toward Tibetans transiting Nepal (Ref </p><p>E).  Efforts to contact the Home Secretary throughout the day </p><p>proved futile.  At 0600 on Saturday May 31, EmbOffs learned </p><p>that the police were preparing to hand over the Tibetan </p><p>detainees to the Chinese Embassy.  EmbOff immediately called </p><p>Home Ministry Secretary Tika Datta Niraula at his residence, </p><p>but was hung-up on after identifying herself as a U.S. </p><p>diplomat.  Repeated attempts to call back were unsuccessful. </p><p>After attempts to call Ministry Joint Secretary Baral proved </p><p>in vain, Charge drove to Hanuman Dhoka jail to meet the </p><p>police and attempt to avert the detainees\' deportation. </p><p>Unfortunately, by the time he arrived (8:00am), the detainees </p><p>were gone (Ref F) and senior police officers made themselves </p><p>unavailable.  The following workday (June 2), the U.S. </p><p>Mission released a press statement deploring the GON decision </p><p>to deport the 18 Tibetans.  EmbOffs\' repeated calls to the </p><p>Home Ministry went unanswered. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>GON Assurances: No Change in Policy Toward Tibetans </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  In a June 4 meeting with Home Minister and Deputy </p><p>Prime Minister Badri Prasad Mandal, Charge received </p><p>assurances that GON humanitarian policy toward Tibetan </p><p>refugees in Nepal had not changed and that future Tibetan </p><p>refugees will be processed as before the deportation.  Mandal </p><p>confirmed that the Chinese Embassy had made a specific </p><p>request for this particular group of Tibetans, but had few </p><p>additional details as the decision was made, he claimed, </p><p>prior to his appointment as Home Minister.  (Note. Mandal was </p><p>appointed Home Minister on April 11, 2003 -- three days </p><p>before the refugees were detained.  End Note.)  Mandal </p><p>asserted that "this type of case will not occur again," as it </p><p>is in Nepal\'s interests to "keep cordial relations with the </p><p>U.S."  He said he recognized the importance of USG assistance </p><p>in combating the Maoist insurgency, adding, "we are serious </p><p>about" preventing another such incident.  In spite of Nepal\'s </p><p>two large neighbors, Mandal asserted that Nepal "can stand on </p><p>its own legs" in order to ensure positive and productive </p><p>relationships with the West, particularly the United States. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) In a second meeting on June 4, Foreign Secretary </p><p>Mahdu Raman Acharya described both the official and </p><p>nonofficial version of events surrounding the deportation. </p><p>(Foreign Minister Shah has been ill and unavailable for </p><p>official meetings.)  According to Acharya, the MFA directed </p><p>its Embassies on June 4 to issue an official press release </p><p>explaining the May 31 incident.  The text he presented </p><p>follows below. </p><p> </p><p>Begin Text: </p><p> </p><p>Nepal is home to more than 135,000 refugees, including </p><p>several thousand Tibetan refugees.  It is not the policy of </p><p>the HMGN to extradite refugees.  HMGN understands and gives </p><p>full consideration to humanitarian and human rights issues of </p><p>the asylum seekers.  Last year alone some 3,000 Tibetan </p><p>refugees were allowed to be processed from Nepal. There is no </p><p>change in policy of HMGN with regard to the refugees. </p><p> </p><p>We have learnt that the reported case of Tibetans were sent </p><p>back after the Immigration Authority of HMGN were fully </p><p>convinced from the investigation that they were not seeking </p><p>asylum, but were a rare case of illegal immigrants.  They </p><p>were allowed to go back after the fines were paid. </p><p> </p><p>HMGN is convinced that the Tibetans sent back do not have </p><p>anything which could be a cause of concern regarding their </p><p>human rights abuses. </p><p> </p><p>End Text. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Acharya reported that immigration officials discovered </p><p>the group of 21 Tibetans in a town in Eastern Nepal, adding </p><p>that it was not known when the group crossed the border.  He </p><p>said that Immigration officials believed the Tibetans were </p><p>intending to reside in Nepal, and consequently were </p><p>categorized as illegal immigrants.  (Note: The Office of </p><p>Tibet had told us the refugees were arrested just outside </p><p>Kathmandu, had just crossed into the country, and were on </p><p>their way to India (Ref B). End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) In confidence, Acharya admitted that the Chinese </p><p>Government had a specific interest in the case of the 18 </p><p>Tibetan refugees.  "It is difficult to go against strong </p><p>Chinese interests," he said, adding, "not that we like it, </p><p>but we could not resist it."  Acharya acknowledged that the </p><p>GON was perfectly aware of the USG position, but had "no </p><p>choice in this case," adding, "the Americans more than anyone </p><p>else know how difficult the Chinese can be."  He also </p><p>confirmed that this decision was made at the highest </p><p>political level within the GON.  He repeated with resignation </p><p>that the decision to go ahead with the deportation was the </p><p>last act of the outgoing government. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Charge showed Acharya copies of the Embassy and State </p><p>Department press releases, as well as Chairman Leach\'s </p><p>statement before the U.S. House of Representatives, adding </p><p>that several Congressmen had indicated an interest in cutting </p><p>U.S. aid to Nepal.  Charge then stressed to Acharya the </p><p>importance of processing remaining refugees in detention as </p><p>evidence of GON commitment to allow Tibetan refugees to </p><p>transit Nepal. (Note: Post learned from UNHCR contacts June 4 </p><p>that one Tibetan man who arrived only a few days after the </p><p>group of 21 Tibetans remained in GON custody.  Earlier this </p><p>week, UNHCR was granted access for an interview, after which </p><p>he was declared "of concern" to the U.N. and a formal letter </p><p>of request for his release was made.  End Note.)  Acharya </p><p>replied that there are "standing instructions" to process </p><p>Tibetan refugees as previously done before this incident. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Acharya said that usually the Chinese are quiet about </p><p>the flow of Tibetan refugees through Nepal. (Note. In a later </p><p>June 4 conversation former PM Sher Bahadur Deuba told </p><p>PolCouns that the Chinese frequently pressure the GON to hand </p><p>over detained Tibetan refugees.  End Note.)  Acharya added </p><p>that his government has conveyed to the Chinese that Nepal </p><p>will not deport future refugees back to China.  In fact, </p><p>Acharya suggested that the GON would try to shorten the </p><p>detention period required to hold Tibetan "illegal </p><p>immigrants" before their release to UNHCR. </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) In a June 4 telephone conversation, Prabakhar Rana, a </p><p>close confidant of the Palace, confirmed that a letter on the </p><p>refugees from an influential private American had been </p><p>delivered on June 2 to King Gyanendra.  Prabakhar also </p><p>confided that he is seeking an audience with the King </p><p>specifically to discuss the Tibetan refugee issue and </p><p>requested information on possible USG action in order to arm </p><p>him for his conversation with King Gyanendra. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>International Response </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>12. (U) The international response to this incident has been </p><p>strong.  Acharya mentioned that the German Foreign Minister </p><p>called the Nepali Foreign Minister to protest that week.  In </p><p>addition to the United States, the UK, UNHCR and Amnesty </p><p>International have issued press releases condemning the </p><p>incident while the EU intends to follow suit as soon as </p><p>possible.  The Foreign Secretary indicated that he has been </p><p>inundated with international messages of protest. </p><p> </p><p>13. (U) However, the Chinese Embassy in Kathmandu also issued </p><p>a June 3 press release defending the GON,s decision to </p><p>deport the 18 Tibetans, claiming it fell "within Nepal\'s </p><p>sovereign jurisdiction and a common international practice." </p><p>The press release also states that "China attaches great </p><p>importance to combating illegal immigrants, and is actively </p><p>involved in various international and regional cooperation in </p><p>this field.  We hold the view that politicizing or adopting </p><p>double standards will not be conducive for the proper </p><p>settlement of the issue of illegal immigrants." </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) The consensus among diplomats, the press and the </p><p>political elite, is that the primary reason for the </p><p>deportation was the unusual pressure put on the GON by the </p><p>Chinese Government.  Our meetings made it clear that despite </p><p>the GON\'s clear understanding of the US position regarding </p><p>the detained refugees, the GON made a calculated decision -- </p><p>most likely at the level of the King himself -- to deport the </p><p>refugees in order to appease their northern neighbor. </p><p> </p><p>15. (C) Comment Continued: The international outcry provoked </p><p>by this incident should make the GON weigh carefully any </p><p>future request to deport detained refugees.  We note with </p><p>concern Acharya\'s assertion that the GON now plans to detain </p><p>undocumented Tibetans as a matter of standard procedure -- a </p><p>significant departure from past practice, in which they were </p><p>directly transferred to the UNHCR.  Unfortunately, if their </p><p>detention becomes an issue of income generation, it may be </p><p>hard to stop.  Post is also concerned that despite Acharya\'s </p><p>and the Deputy Prime Minister\'s assurances that this incident </p><p>will not recur, any detention period could put the refugees </p><p>in jeopardy of deportation.  We hope that Acharya\'s assertion </p><p>that the GON desired to shorten the period of detention </p><p>indicates an interest in keeping the refugees below China\'s </p><p>radar screen.  End Comment. </p><p>BOGGS </p><p></p></div>
