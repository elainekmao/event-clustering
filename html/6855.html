<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 000582 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CAIRO FOR MAXSTADT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/26/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, KDEM, PINR, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: HEADCOUNT OF POLITICALLY MOTIVATED </p><p>KILLINGS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter.  Reasons: 1.5 (B & </p><p>D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  Violence is an integral part of the Nigerian </p><p>electoral scene.  In recent weeks, </p><p>the pace has picked up, with confirmed incidents of violence </p><p>occurring in at least 24 of </p><p>Nigeria\'s 36 states.  The incidents range from rock-throwing </p><p>at the motorcades of elected </p><p>officials to midnight assassinations of key political </p><p>figures.  The political scene was </p><p>rocked by the March 5 killing of the opposition ANPP </p><p>supporter Marshall Harry in Abuja </p><p>three days before he was to have launched the campaign for </p><p>presidential candidate retired </p><p>General Muhammadu Buhari in Rivers State. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  The following is a partial list of politically </p><p>motivated murders and near misses </p><p>over the last two years in Nigeria. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>- Governor James Ibori escaped from a gun battle between two </p><p>factions of the People\'s </p><p>Democratic Party (PDP) on February 4, 2001. </p><p>- Momoh Lawal, a relative of Umar Akaaba, former Chairman, </p><p>Okene LGA in Kogi </p><p>State, killed on March 5, 2001. </p><p>- Four killed in Abakaliki, Ebonyi State, when supporters of </p><p>National Senate President </p><p>Anyim Pius Anyim\'s clashed with those of Governor Sam Egwu\'s </p><p>on August 24, 2001. </p><p>- Victor Nwankwo, younger brother of Arthur Nwankwo, founder, </p><p>Eastern Mandate </p><p>Union (EMU), murdered on August 29, 2001. </p><p>- Monday Ndor, Rivers State legislator, killed in Port </p><p>Harcourt in August 2001. </p><p>- Odunayo Olagbaju, Osun State legislator, killed in Ile-Ife </p><p>on December 21, 2001. </p><p>- Chief Bola Ige, Attorney-General and Minister of Justice, </p><p>murdered on December 23, </p><p>2001. </p><p>- Janet Oladape, a PDP leader in Ondo State, clubbed to death </p><p>on August 13, 2002. </p><p>- Alhaji Ahmed Pategi, Kwara State Chairman, PDP, murdered in </p><p>Kogi State, on August </p><p>15, 2002.  Kola Kasum, his predecessor, was killed earlier in </p><p>the year. </p><p>- Barnabas Igwe, Chairman of the Nigeria Bar Association, and </p><p>his wife, Abigail Igwe, </p><p>murdered on September 1, 2002. </p><p>- Chimere Ikoku, former Vice Chancellor, University of </p><p>Nigeria-Nsukka, killed in his </p><p>residence in Enugu on October 20, 2002. </p><p>- Dele Arojo, PDP gubernatorial aspirant, killed by unknown </p><p>assailants in Lagos on </p><p>November 25, 2002. </p><p>- In December 2002, Alhaji Isyaku Muhammad, United Nigeria </p><p>Peoples Party (UNPP) </p><p>North-West vice chairman, was assassinated. </p><p>- One ANPP Chief killed in Ibadan, Oyo State capital in an </p><p>intra-party clash, January 13, </p><p>2003. </p><p>- On February 8, 2003 Chief Ogbonnaya Uche, All Nigeria </p><p>People\'s Party (ANPP) </p><p>senatorial candidate in Imo State, was assassinated. </p><p>- Mr. Theodore A. Agwatu, Principal Secretary to the Governor </p><p>of Imo State, killed in </p><p>February 2003. </p><p>- On February 18, 2003, a security man in the residence of </p><p>Paul Unongo, ANPP </p><p>gubernatorial candidate in Benue State, was murdered by </p><p>unknown gunmen while </p><p>Unongo escaped. </p><p>- On February 20, 2003, PDP gubernatorial candidate in Kwara </p><p>State, Bukola Saraki, </p><p>escaped an assassination attempt. </p><p>- On February 23, 2003, the Speaker of the Borno State House </p><p>of Assembly, Inuwa </p><p>Kubo, escaped an assassination attempt. </p><p>- March 5, 2003, Dr. Marshal Harry, South-South ANPP </p><p>vice-chairman, was murdered. </p><p>- Mrs. Emily Omope, an Alliance for Democracy (AD) member, </p><p>died on March 3, 2003 </p><p>from wounds incurred in an acid attack in December 2002 by </p><p>unknown persons. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  Unsurprisingly, most of these attacks have </p><p>occurred in the southern part of the </p><p>country.  However, the few incidents in the North show that </p><p>the potential for violence is </p><p>not limited to a particular region of the country.  The most </p><p>recent trend is attacks on </p><p>ANPP supporters who abandoned the ruling PDP to improve their </p><p>electoral chances. </p><p>Still, no party is immune to these attacks. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Violence in Nigerian elections has been present </p><p>since the country gained </p><p>independence and will continue to make up a part of the </p><p>political landscape for some time </p><p>to come.  However, violence in the past has usually involved </p><p>confrontations between </p><p>groups of thugs hired by contending politicians or their </p><p>financial backers.  The thugs and </p><p>innocent bystanders have been the major victims.  The </p><p>difference this time is that a </p><p>significant number of real political players have been </p><p>attacked, engendering an acute and </p><p>growing sense of insecurity among the political elites -- </p><p>something that has not been </p><p>observed in previous electoral cycles.  We expect the pattern </p><p>of attacks to continue </p><p>through and after the elections as various politicians </p><p>attempt to secure position and settle </p><p>scores in a political process short on democratic input among </p><p>the masses and long on </p><p>potential financial gains for the victors. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
