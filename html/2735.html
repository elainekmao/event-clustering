<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ROME 001769 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR DRL A/S LORNE CRANER FROM DCM WILLIAM POPE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/09/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PREL, IT, US, UNHRC-1 </p><p>SUBJECT: UNCHR: ITALIANS EXPECT INCREASED U.S. EFFORT TO </p><p>CONSULT </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. POPE/CRANER E-MAILS </p><p> </p><p>     B. ROME 1556 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: DCM WILLIAM POPE.  REASON 1.5 (B), (D). </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  01769  091420Z </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) MFA POLITICAL DIRECTOR GIANCARLO ARAGONA IS SCHEDULED </p><p>TO MEET YOU 4/11, AFTER ARRIVING IN WASHINGTON 4/10. </p><p>ARAGONA\'S ROLE WAS INSTRUMENTAL, IF NOT DECISIVE, IN THE </p><p>GOI\'S DECISION TO POSTPONE ITS UNCHR CANDIDACY AND THEREBY </p><p>MAKE WAY FOR THE U.S. TO RETURN TO THE COMMISSION IN 2003. </p><p>ALTHOUGH NO "DEAL MAKING" WAS INVOLVED, IT\'S FAIR TO SAY THE </p><p>ITALIANS EXPECT SOMETHING MORE FROM THIS GESTURE THAN AN </p><p>ABSTRACT EXPRESSION OF USG APPRECIATION AND GRATITUDE. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) A THEME WE FREQUENTLY HEAR IN ROME IS THAT THE USG </p><p>DOES NOT TREAT ITALY ON A PAR WITH CERTAIN EU PARTNERS (E.G., </p><p>U.K., GERMANY, FRANCE).  THE ITALIANS WOULD LIKE TO BE (AND </p><p>TO BE SEEN TO BE) CONSULTED ON MAJOR ISSUES BEFOREHAND.  SUCH </p><p>CONSULTATION WOULD NOT NECESSARILY CHANGE ITALIAN VIEWS.  AS </p><p>IS THE CASE IN OTHER INTERNATIONAL FORA, ITALIAN VIEWS ON </p><p>MATTERS BEFORE THE COMMISSION TEND TO BE STRAITJACKETED BY </p><p>THE "EU CONSENSUS."  HOWEVER, AS NOTED REF B, THE GOI UNDER </p><p>PRIME MINISTER SILVIO BERLUSCONI CONSIDERS THE ASSERTION OF </p><p>NATIONAL INTERESTS WITHIN EU FORUMS TO BE AS LEGITIMATE FOR </p><p>ITALY AS IT IS FOR COUNTRIES SUCH AS GERMANY AND FRANCE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, ADVANCE CONSULTATION </p><p>PRESENTS US CONSIDERABLE ADVANTAGES.  WITH THE SHARP </p><p>EXCEPTION OF THE DEATH PENALTY, WHICH ARAGONA IS LIKELY TO </p><p>RAISE, GOI VIEWS ON MATTERS BEFORE THE UNCHR TEND TO BE </p><p>PARALLEL OR, AT LEAST, SYMPATHETIC TO OURS.  WE STAND TO GAIN </p><p>FROM AN INVIGORATED GOI VOICE IN EU COUNCILS THAT HAS ALREADY </p><p>HEARD AND TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT USG VIEWS.  AND THERE ALSO WILL </p><p>BE OCCASIONS WHEN GOI ADVICE CAN HELP SHAPE FOR THE BETTER </p><p>OUR APPROACH TO THE EU AND COMMISSION MEMBERS AT LARGE. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01769  091420Z </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME01769 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
