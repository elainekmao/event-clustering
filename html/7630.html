END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>================================ </p><p>Tiger Statement re Key Committee </p><p>================================ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) In a statement issued late April 23, the </p><p>Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) announced that </p><p>it was postponing the next meeting of a key committee </p><p>focused on humanitarian assistance issues (see Para 3 </p><p>for information on this committee).  The statement came </p><p>in the form of a letter from S.P. Thamilchelvam, the </p><p>head of the LTTE\'s Political Section, to Ambassador </p><p>Bernard Goonetilleke, the head of the GSL\'s Peace </p><p>Secretariat. </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) (((Note:  Before the LTTE\'s April 23 </p><p>announcement, the next meeting of the Sub-Committee on </p><p>Immediate Humanitarian and Rebilitation Needs in the </p><p>North and the East, "SIHRN," had been scheduled to take </p><p>place April 25-26 in Kilinochchi in the LTTE-controlled </p><p>Wanni region.  SIHRN, which began operations earlier </p><p>this year as agreed in the peace talks, is a joint </p><p>committee made up of GSL and LTTE representatives. </p><p>Norwegian facilitators and Japanese advisers guide the </p><p>process.  SIHRN had been holding semi-regular meetings </p><p>up to this point.))) </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) The LTTE\'s statement attributes the decision to </p><p>postpone the meeting to "our leadership\'s wish to await </p><p>action and implementation on urgent matters" raised in </p><p>its April 21 announcement that it was pulling out of the </p><p>peace talks (see Ref B).  The statement, the text of </p><p>which is contained in Para 8, goes on to complain that: </p><p>"As you (the GSL) are aware, urgent action is required </p><p>on resettlement and rehabilitation of internally </p><p>displaced people and of refugees.  We wish to implore </p><p>the government of Sri Lanka to act on matters...enabling </p><p>the return to normal life to people" in the north and </p><p>east.  The statement wraps up by saying:  "We wish to </p><p>reiterate that mutual trust and cooperation can be </p><p>restored through decisive and urgent action" by the </p><p>government "to alleviate the hardships of the people in </p><p>the northeast." </p><p> </p><p>============================= </p><p>Norwegian and Indian Reaction </p><p>============================= </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) When queried, Norwegian government facilitators </p><p>admitted to being caught off guard by the LTTE\'s latest </p><p>action.  In an April 24 conversation, Norwegian embassy </p><p>polchief Tomas Stangeland told us the first indication </p><p>the GoN had that the meeting was being postponed was a </p><p>LTTE fax containing Thamilchelvam\'s letter that came in </p><p>April 23.  Up to that time, the Norwegians, convinced </p><p>the meeting was on, were preparing to send their team to </p><p>Kilinochchi.  In response to the unfolding events, </p><p>Stangeland said Norwegian Ambassador Hans Brattskar </p><p>planned to meet with GSL officials led by chief </p><p>negotiator G.L. Peiris to discuss next steps soon.  The </p><p>GoN has also forwarded a request to Kilinochchi to meet </p><p>with Thamilchelvam within the next week (as of late </p><p>April 24, there had been no response to this request </p><p>from the LTTE).  Stangeland added that he thought the </p><p>decision by the LTTE to postpone the meeting was </p><p>completely counter-productive.  He said the Norwegian </p><p>facilitation effort would keep plugging away, hoping </p><p>that the Tigers\' recent decisions were mere posturing. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) In an April 24 meeting, Indian High Commission </p><p>polchief Taranjit Sandhu told us the Tigers\' decision </p><p>was another "unfortunate" move by the group.  He said he </p><p>thought it was a "tactical" step by the Tigers, who </p><p>wanted to put pressure on the GSL to cave in on various </p><p>issues, including by reducing the security zones in </p><p>Jaffna.  India, he commented, had no indication that the </p><p>group was intending to leave the peace process </p><p>altogether.  The GoI would continue to monitor the </p><p>situation, however. </p><p> </p><p>======= </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>======= </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Coupled with their withdrawal from the peace </p><p>talks, the latest Tiger move places added pressure on </p><p>the whole process.  At this point, the government and </p><p>the Norwegians seem to be scrambling a bit to find a way </p><p>to respond to the LTTE and, by doing so, try to prevent </p><p>further unraveling.  While the LTTE is broadcasting its </p><p>views, it seems to have turned off the receive mode, </p><p>however.  Despite all the bad news, there is still not a </p><p>sense of panic regarding the state of the peace process. </p><p>That said, skepticism regarding the LTTE is steadily </p><p>rising.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>====================== </p><p>Text of LTTE Statement </p><p>====================== </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) The text of the LTTE statement issued late </p><p>April 23 follows: </p><p> </p><p>Begin text: </p><p> </p><p>Mr. Goonetilleke: </p><p> </p><p>In accordance with the decision of our organization\'s </p><p>leadership to suspend our participation in the </p><p>negotiations, we regretfully wish to postpone the next </p><p>meeting of the sub committee on immediate humanitarian </p><p>rehabilitation needs (SIHRN).  It is our leadership\'s </p><p>wish to await action and implementation on urgent </p><p>matters raised by Mr. A. Balasingham in his letter to </p><p>the prime minister, Hon. Mr. Ranil Wickremsinghe, prior </p><p>to setting a date for the next meeting.  As you are </p><p>aware, urgent action is required on resettlement and </p><p>rehabilitation of internally displaced people and of </p><p>refugees. </p><p> </p><p>We also wish to implore the government of Sri Lanka to </p><p>take immediate steps to act on matters already agreed at </p><p>previous meetings of the sub-committee and ensure </p><p>humanitarian and rehabilitation projects in the </p><p>northeast are implemented enabling the return of normal </p><p>life to the people living there.  In the meantime, we </p><p>are also hopeful that all efforts will be made by your </p><p>government to urgently seek the funds from pledges made </p><p>by several international donors at the Oslo conference </p><p>on 25th November last year to be targeted for identified </p><p>projects through the northeast reconstruction fund </p><p>(NERF).  In the last few months, from announcements made </p><p>at our meetings, expectations among the people of the </p><p>northeast have been raised to a high level.  Therefore </p><p>it would be meaningless for the sub-committee to </p><p>continue to meet regularly without any tangible action </p><p>on the ground. </p><p> </p><p>While we regret that we are compelled to postpone the </p><p>next meeting of the SIHRN, we wish to reiterate that </p><p>mutual trust and cooperation can be restored through </p><p>decisive and urgent action from the government of Sri </p><p>Lanka to alleviate the hardships of the people in the </p><p>northeast. </p><p>Yours Truly, </p><p> </p><p>S.P. Thamilchelvam </p><p>Head, Political Section </p><p>Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam </p><p> </p><p>End text. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
