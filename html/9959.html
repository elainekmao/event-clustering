<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 TEGUCIGALPA 001863 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR WHA, WHA/CEN, WHA/PPC, IO, AND INR/B </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/07/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PINS, PINR, ECON, HO </p><p>SUBJECT: REPLACING PEREZ-CADALSO: HONDURAS SEEKS NEW </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. TEGUCIGALPA 1778 </p><p> </p><p>     B. TEGUCIGALPA 1108 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Charge d\'Affaires, a.i., Roger Pierce; </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) SUMMARY: Guillermo Perez-Cadalso Arias, former </p><p>Minister of Foreign Affairs, is being sworn in this week as </p><p>the president of the National Autonomous University of </p><p>Honduras (UNAH).  In order to make himself eligible for the </p><p>position, Perez-Cadalso officially resigned as Foreign </p><p>Minister on July 22, and Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs </p><p>Anibal Quinonez is now serving as the acting Minister. </p><p>However, it is far from clear whether Quinonez will remain at </p><p>the helm of the Foreign Ministry on a permanent basis.  Rumor </p><p>has it that others, such as Ramon Medina Luna, President </p><p>Ricardo Maduro\'s National Security Advisor, and Oswaldo Ramos </p><p>Soto, an influential member of the National Congress, are </p><p>also in the running for the position. END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>Perez-Cadalso </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Guillermo Perez-Cadalso, former Minister of Foreign </p><p>Affairs, is being sworn in this week as the president of the </p><p>National Autonomous University of Honduras (UNAH).  On July </p><p>22, in order to make himself available for the position, </p><p>Perez-Cadalso presented his resignation to President Ricardo </p><p>Maduro, who had appointed him Minister of Foreign Affairs in </p><p>January 2002.  Perez-Cadalso was not pressured into quitting, </p><p>and has actually coveted the position of UNAH president for </p><p>some time.  The presidency of the university carries with it </p><p>more domestic prestige, and Perez-Cadalso is an academic at </p><p>heart, having led the UNAH\'s Law Department during the 1980s. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>Quinonez and Other Possible Replacements </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Anibal Quinonez is the Honduran Vice Minister for </p><p>Foreign Affairs, and current acting head of the Ministry. </p><p>Born January 7, 1950, he received a undergraduate degree in </p><p>law from UNAH and a Master\'s degree in International </p><p>Relations from the University of El Salvador in Argentina. </p><p>Quinonez entered the Honduran Foreign Service in 1973, and </p><p>served in Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, France, and Israel. </p><p>In 1981 he was named Ambassador to Uruguay and served </p><p>simultaneously as Non-Resident Ambassador to Paraguay until </p><p>1983.  During his time in Uruguay, U.S. EmbOffs in Montevideo </p><p>described him as a friend and admirer of the U.S.  Quinonez </p><p>was named Ambassador to Japan in 1985, and during his </p><p>nine-year stay in Tokyo he also served as the Non-Resident </p><p>Ambassador to South Korea, Philippines, Thailand, and </p><p>Singapore.  From 1995 to 1998 Quinonez served as the </p><p>Director-General of Foreign Policy, and was named to his </p><p>current post in 2002.  He has been an excellent contact of </p><p>the Embassy in this position.  Quinonez is married and has </p><p>four children. </p><p> </p><p>4. (S) Other names rumored to PolOffs as being in the running </p><p>for the Minister position are Ramon Medina Luna and Oswaldo </p><p>Ramos Soto.  Medina Luna was also mentioned at the beginning </p><p>of President Maduro\'s term as a possible Minister of Foreign </p><p>Affairs before being named National Security Advisor.  He is </p><p>an experienced professional with considerable expertise in </p><p>economic development and regional trade.  (Medina Luna is </p><p>married for a second time; his wife is Nicaragua.  He has </p><p>grown children from a previous marriage).  Ramos Soto being </p><p>considered as a possible successor to Perez-Cadalso is a bit </p><p>more surprising.  In April 1988 he allegedly incited a crowd </p><p>that later burned down the Embassy annex after U.S. </p><p>authorities captured (with Honduran Government approval) a </p><p>Honduran narcotrafficker.  Ramos Soto, then president of the </p><p>UNAH, claims that he neither proposed nor approved of the </p><p>action; he contends he merely told the students who became </p><p>the nucleus of the mob that he believed the U.S. action was </p><p>illegal.  More recently, Ramos Soto raised eyebrows this </p><p>spring when he used his position as the head of the National </p><p>Congress\' Commission on Constitutional Issues to advocate </p><p>giving the Congress, rather than the Supreme Court, the power </p><p>to interpret the constitution (ref B). </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) COMMENT:  While Quinonez would be a good choice, and </p><p>Medina Luna acceptable, it would be difficult to work with </p><p>Ramos Soto, who is from the "dark side" of the National </p><p>Party, and about whom there are allegations of significant </p><p>corruption.  The Maduro Administration seems to be in no </p><p>hurry to name a replacement to Perez-Cadalso </p><p>(correspondingly, GOH attendance at UNGA is still in flux). </p><p>Recently rocked by the defection of the Christian Democrats </p><p>from the ruling coalition (ref A), grumbling within his own </p><p>National Party, the resignation of Maduro confidant Cesar </p><p>Batres, and the ominous departure of the First Lady on a trip </p><p>to Spain (septel), attention within the Administration is </p><p>focused primarily on damage control.  Post will continue to </p><p>monitor progress on any permanent replacement and will report </p><p>accordingly.  END COMMENT. </p><p>Pierce </p><p></p></div>
