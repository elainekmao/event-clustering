<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 002437 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JFRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/04/2012 </p><p>TAGS: EAGR, PGOV, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: COMMERCIAL FARMERS\' LEADERSHIP IS THE VICTIM OF </p><p>DEEP PHILOSOPHICAL DIVISIONS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Labor officer Karen Bel for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C)  Summary:  Both Colin Cloete, President, and David </p><p>Hasluck, Director, of the Commercial Farmers\' Union (CFU) </p><p>tendered their resignations on October 29 at the CFU\'s </p><p>national council meeting.  These resignations, both of which </p><p>are effective within thirty days, highlight broad gulfs -- </p><p>between those remaining on their farms and those completely </p><p>dispossessed, between those who favor dialogue with the GOZ </p><p>and those who favor confrontation, between those who believe </p><p>they have a future alongside ZANU-PF and those who advocate </p><p>for a wholesale political change.  Part of the pressure which </p><p>resulted in these resignations was instigated by inflammatory </p><p>press reports of the two leaders\' meeting with an informal </p><p>delegation of visiting Americans headed by NY Councilman </p><p>Charles Barron.  Deputy Director Dr. Jerry Grant has also </p><p>resigned, leaving Vice President Doug Taylor-Freeme -- who is </p><p>more disposed to confrontation with the GOZ -- in charge </p><p>until a new president and director are chosen on November 26. </p><p> However, with as few as 600 commercial farmers (of whom 400 </p><p>are currently under either Section 5 preliminary notice or </p><p>Section 8 final notice of acquisition) from a previous high </p><p>of 4,500 commercial farmers remaining on their land, this </p><p>latest fracture in solidarity may well signal the complete </p><p>demise of commercial farmers as an effective and cohesive </p><p>group.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>Internal Conflicts Brewing </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU)  Colin Cloete, who was elected President in 2001, </p><p>has been one of the prime advocates maintaining dialogue with </p><p>the ZANU-PF GOZ.  Although he has experienced continued </p><p>pressure from settlers and local land committee officials on </p><p>his own farm in the Norton area, Cloete has continued to </p><p>express hope that the GOZ would recognize that white </p><p>Zimbabwean commercial farmers have a valuable role to play in </p><p>Zimbabwe\'s economic recovery.  David Hasluck, who has been </p><p>Director since 1984, is also an advocate for dialogue with </p><p>the GOZ.  Hasluck remains on his farm, and is currently </p><p>proceeding with a tobacco crop despite the presence of </p><p>settlers on his land.  Both men believe that "when things </p><p>come right," Zimbabwe will need commercial farmers in order </p><p>to re-create food security as well as a viable economy. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU)  The CFU has been subjected to multiple pressures </p><p>during the past six months.  The first wave of Section 8 </p><p>final acquisition orders "matured" in August, and thousands </p><p>of farmers were forced off their land by settlers, land </p><p>committee members, ZANU-PF beneficiaries, and war veteran </p><p>groups.  At the same time, some commercial farmers formed </p><p>Justice for Agriculture (JAG), a hardline advocacy group </p><p>which claimed a mandate to publicize the plight of commercial </p><p>farmers, dispossessed farm workers, and agro-businesses, all </p><p>of which are suffering under the chaotic land reform program. </p><p> JAG encouraged farmers to keep their title deeds, resist </p><p>attempts to subdivide their land, and challenge the GOZ in </p><p>court wherever possible.  In September, the CFU suspended </p><p>regional officer Ben Freeth for taking a "confrontational" </p><p>approach towards the government after he denounced the GOZ in </p><p>a prayer at a CFU meeting.  Many of the remaining CFU members </p><p>were incensed that Freeth was suspended for speaking what </p><p>many of them privately believed. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>Blindsided by the GOZ-controlled Press </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  However, the final nail in the coffin was apparently </p><p>Hasluck\'s statement -- taken out of context and published in </p><p>the GOZ-controlled press -- in which he reportedly unleashed </p><p>a "surprise onslaught" blaming Britain for a diplomatic </p><p>standoff with Harare, resulting in commercial farmers failing </p><p>to receive compensation for their land.  Hasluck admits </p><p>making statements about Britain in the Barron meeting, but he </p><p>claims that his statements were made in response to direct </p><p>and specific questions and did not take the form of an </p><p>"onslaught" against anybody.  Post had contacted the CFU in </p><p>order to facilitate a meeting with the Barron entourage </p><p>(which was in Zimbabwe at the invitation of the GOZ)  after </p><p>Barron stated that his group wanted to get "the other side of </p><p>the story," only to be told that the GOZ had already arranged </p><p>a meeting.  When Barron\'s group arrived at the CFU offices -- </p><p>apparently now perceived as a "legitimate" fact-finding </p><p>mission due to Post\'s request -- it had grown to include </p><p>several prominent ZANU-PF journalists.  In retrospect, the </p><p>CFU should have set the usual ground rules for the </p><p>participation of the press.  Despite doubts as to the group\'s </p><p>intentions, however, Hasluck and Cloete voiced the CFU\'s </p><p>position.  Their worst fears were realized when a distorted </p><p>version of the meeting made the front page of the following </p><p>day\'s Herald, with a picture of the Americans seated with the </p><p>two commercial farmers, alongside reports that Hasluck was </p><p>now joining Mugabe in blaming Britain for all of Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>troubles. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  This situation highlights the risks which Embassy </p><p>contacts face when they agree to meet with unofficial </p><p>delegations, particularly those that have some degree of </p><p>solidarity with Mugabe\'s regime.  The Barron delegation also </p><p>attempted to bring an expanded group in to meet with several </p><p>other Zimbabwean interlocutors unsympathetic toward the GOZ, </p><p>and could have faced the same press treatment.  However, </p><p>these individuals were sufficiently wary that they refused to </p><p>allow ZANU-PF press participation.  Regardless, in the case </p><p>of Amani Trust, the Barron delegation apparently leaked </p><p>accusations about international funding of Amani to the GOZ </p><p>press afterwards, and this information featured prominently </p><p>in subsequent press attempts to cast Amani as a "western </p><p>imperialist puppet" organization.  As long as visiting </p><p>American groups -- either knowingly or unwittingly -- are </p><p>subject to exploitation and manipulation by the GOZ, it may </p><p>be prudent to limit USG support for future unofficial trips. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C)  In the case of the CFU, it is unlikely that Hasluck </p><p>made the statements attributed to him in the manner reported, </p><p>but truth is less important than perception in the </p><p>highly-charged environment of Zimbabwe.  The alleged Hasluck </p><p>"onslaught" against Britain neatly parrots the current </p><p>ZANU-PF anti-British rhetoric and exploited pre-existing </p><p>rifts in the dwindling ranks of the beleaguered CFU. </p><p>Unfortunately, the CFU has now lost three of the few moderate </p><p>voices in its leadership, and another potential source of </p><p>civic debate and civic action has been silenced. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
