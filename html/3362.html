<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 004082 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR PRM/ANE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREF, EAID, KPAL, LE </p><p>SUBJECT: PRM AMBASSADORS\' FUND REQUEST FOR PALESTINIAN </p><p>REFUGEES IN JORDAN </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 15910 </p><p>     B. JUNE 25 BARTLETT/POLASCHIK E-MAIL </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary:  Ambassador requests $40,000 under the PRM </p><p>Ambassadors\' fund for refugees in the Middle East, to </p><p>purchase a 14-passenger minibus for the Community </p><p>Rehabilitation Center (CRC) at Baqa\'a camp ($20,000) and to </p><p>build an addition to the Women\'s Program Center (WPC) at </p><p>Jebel Hussein camp ($20,000).  The minibus purchase would </p><p>allow Baqa\'a camp\'s CRC to shuttle 215 disabled students from </p><p>their homes to the center, and to bring therapists to </p><p>homebound disabled children.  Both the GOJ\'s Department of </p><p>Palestinian Affairs and UNRWA have identified support for </p><p>disabled programs as one of the greatest needs in the refugee </p><p>community.  PRM support for an addition to Jebel Hussein </p><p>camp\'s WPC would allow the center to serve an additional 100 </p><p>vocational trainees per month, provide additional </p><p>revenue-generating programs and further overall USG refugee </p><p>goals of strengthening women\'s programs.  Both projects would </p><p>respond to critical gaps in refugee assistance programs.  We </p><p>are submitting two funding requests based on PRM\'s indication </p><p>(ref b) that up to $40,000 may be available for projects in </p><p>Jordan.  If only $20,000 is available, our first priority is </p><p>the minibus for Baqa\'a camp\'s CRC.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>A Bus for Disabled Children </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  In separate meetings with refcoord, both the GOJ\'s </p><p>Department of Palestinian Affairs and UNRWA relief officials </p><p>identified support for disabled programs as one of the </p><p>greatest needs in Jordan\'s refugee community.  UNRWA provides </p><p>assistance to disabled Palestinian refugees through Jordan\'s </p><p>10 Community Rehabilitation Centers (CRC) -- independent, </p><p>community-based organizations that are severely underfunded. </p><p>Although UNRWA provides financial and technical support to </p><p>the CRCs in Jordan (an average of $12,500 per center per </p><p>year), this is not enough to cover the centers\' running </p><p>costs, much less major purchases.  In addition to UNRWA </p><p>support, the CRC in Baqa\'a camp (established in 1998 with </p><p>significant support from PRM) receives rental income from </p><p>commercial properties it owns in the camp, as well as income </p><p>from the nominal fees paid by families who benefit from its </p><p>services.  The center relies heavily on contributions from </p><p>international NGOs and local embassies.  The center is </p><p>managed by an active, voluntary board and well-qualified </p><p>professional staff.  With technical support from UNRWA, it </p><p>also has strong financial management procedures in place. </p><p> </p><p>3.  PRM funding is requested to purchase a minibus for the </p><p>center, to shuttle to and from the center the 215 disabled </p><p>children it serves, and to bring therapists to homebound </p><p>disabled children -- a new program that can be implemented </p><p>only with a new bus.  The center currently provides services </p><p>for the hearing-impaired; speech therapy; physiotherapy; </p><p>primary education for the mentally impaired; and family </p><p>counseling services. </p><p> </p><p>4.  Baqa\'a camp\'s CRC would implement the program, purchasing </p><p>the bus from a local vendor as soon as funding is available. </p><p>The GOJ\'s Department of Palestinian Affairs, which identified </p><p>this project to refcoord, has indicated it will facilitate a </p><p>tax-exempt purchase and vehicle registration.  The sole cost </p><p>of the project is the $20,000 purchase price, which reflects </p><p>local market value for a 14-passenger minibus.  Refcoord </p><p>would monitor the project. </p><p> </p><p>5.  Support for this key disabled assistance program is the </p><p>Ambassador\'s first funding priority. </p><p> </p><p>Expanded Programs for Refugee Women </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  Jordan\'s 27 women\'s program centers (WPC) provide </p><p>vocational training, daycare, fitness and education programs </p><p>to Palestinian refugee women.  Although they receive some </p><p>financial and technical support from UNRWA (an average of </p><p>$8,000 per center per year), these independent, </p><p>community-based organizations do not have enough resources to </p><p>cover capital improvements.  The centers\' programs typically </p><p>are self-sustaining, financed by the fees charged to course </p><p>participants and daycare clients.  Support for the WPCs would </p><p>further overall USG refugee goals of strengthening women\'s </p><p>programs. </p><p> </p><p>7.  The WPC in Jebel Hussein camp was established in 1987, </p><p>with significant support from UNRWA.  It currently provides </p><p>vocational training (sewing, computer and hairdressing </p><p>courses), daycare and fitness program to 220 women per month. </p><p> It also runs a groundbreaking legal aid bureau (one of only </p><p>two in Jordan), where Palestinian refugee women can seek </p><p>specific legal advice and also attend workshops and seminars </p><p>on more general legal issues.  The center is governed by a </p><p>dynamic, voluntary board of 7 women, with strong </p><p>organizational skills, and has stringent management and </p><p>financial controls. </p><p> </p><p>8.  PRM funding is requested to build a 107 square meter </p><p>addition to the existing Jebel Hussein WPC building, which </p><p>would enable the center to expand its programs significantly </p><p>and serve an additional 100 trainees per month.  (All </p><p>training currently takes place in a cramped library and two </p><p>classrooms.)  The addition also would include space for a </p><p>small canteen, which would provide the center with another </p><p>source of income.  The women\'s committee will provide $6,740 </p><p>of its own funds toward construction costs.  A contribution </p><p>of $20,000 is requested to cover the remaining construction </p><p>costs. A budget breakdown reflecting both the USG </p><p>contribution and the Women,s Committee contribution is as </p><p>follows: </p><p> </p><p>Project Costs </p><p>Design Plans                        $   350 </p><p>Site Supervision              $ 2,120 </p><p>External Construction         $11,300 </p><p>Internal finishing                  $10,850 </p><p>Inflation & contingencies     $ 2,120 </p><p>Total Cost                    $26,470 </p><p> </p><p>Women,s Program Center (WPC) Contribution </p><p>Design Plan                   $   350 </p><p>Site Supervision              $ 2,210 </p><p>Internal Finishing            $ 1,880 </p><p>Inflation & Contingencies     $ 2,120 </p><p>Total                         $ 6,470 </p><p> </p><p>USG Contribution </p><p>External Contribution        $11,300 </p><p>Internal Finishing           $ 8,700 </p><p>Total                        $20,000 </p><p> </p><p>9.  Jebel Hussein Camp\'s WPC would implement the project, </p><p>including contracting and supervision of all construction </p><p>services.  Refcoord would monitor the project. </p><p> </p><p>Administrative Note </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  Post has the authority and procedures in place to </p><p>transfer these funds to the intended recipient agencies. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
