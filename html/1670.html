<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 000962 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/04/2011 </p><p>TAGS: PINS, PINR, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: COURTESY CALL ON NIGERIAN SSS CHIEF ARE </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter; Reasons 1.5 (B) </p><p>and (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: Ambassador Jeter called on the Director </p><p>General of the Nigerian State Security Service (SSS), Kayode </p><p>Are, on April 23 at SSS Headquarters.  The Ambassador was </p><p>accompanied by Embassy Counselor for Regional Affairs.  Afas </p><p>Gadzama, the SSS Deputy Director for Intelligence, also </p><p>participated.  Ambassador Jeter used the meeting to describe </p><p>the importance the U.S. places on Nigeria succeeding in </p><p>consolidating its democracy and on an internal intelligence </p><p>and security service\'s obeying the rule of law and responding </p><p>to democratically elected civilian authority.  A wide-ranging </p><p>discussion on regional issues also characterized the meeting. </p><p> END SUMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>=============== </p><p>DOMESTIC ISSUES </p><p>=============== </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Are noted he was very interested in helping make  the </p><p>Nigerian government\'s transition from dealing with the </p><p>Clinton Administration to the Bush Administration "seamless." </p><p> He noted that it was the Bush Administration that provided </p><p>Nigeria\'s Narcotics Certification.  He said he hoped that the </p><p>Bush Administration would understand Nigeria\'s role in </p><p>Africa, and added "We can provide a front line response and </p><p>bear the brunt" for international actions on the continent. </p><p>Are noted his agency is working at a faster pace than before </p><p>the Obasanjo inauguration.  He stated he was interested in </p><p>"capacity-building" to increase the capabilities of the SSS, </p><p>particularly in building data bases on issues of particular </p><p>interest.  Are then began a long discussion of economic </p><p>issues; pressing particularly for assistance in increasing </p><p>foreign investor confidence and engagement in Nigeria.  He </p><p>noted that U.S. narcotics certification would help foreign </p><p>investor confidence. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Are then described his strategy for preventing </p><p>Nigeria from becoming a haven for international terrorists, </p><p>particularly the north.  He said the SSS was now completing </p><p>the training of a group of intelligence officers from Niger </p><p>to strengthen that country,s "ineffective" security </p><p>organizations.  He said the SSS wanted to establish a cadre </p><p>of officers in neighboring countries with whom Nigeria would </p><p>be familiar and who could be dealt with more quickly and at a </p><p>lower working-level than the current ongoing exchanges </p><p>between national security advisors in each country.  He said </p><p>he was particularly interested in building good databases on </p><p>members of international terrorist organization.  Are also </p><p>said he believed some non-Nigerian members of Algerian </p><p>terrorist organizations may be hiding out in northern </p><p>Nigeria.  His service was looking for them and was causing </p><p>these fugitives to "keep low." He said they avoid causing </p><p>trouble in Nigeria to diminish their risk of being </p><p>discovered. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>==================== </p><p>REGIONAL COOPERATION </p><p>==================== </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The Ambassador and the DG discussed regional </p><p>cooperation in some detail.  Ambassador Jeter described his </p><p>perception of the successes and failures of regional </p><p>cooperation in southern Africa, based upon his 15 years of </p><p>working in that region.  Are noted that initial efforts to </p><p>build cooperation in West Africa had not gone very far.  He </p><p>observed that the West African Security Coordinators\' </p><p>meetings used to occur regularly, primarily among Anglophone </p><p>countries.  Francophone countries were now beginning to get </p><p>over their initial wariness toward the idea.  He stated that </p><p>security chiefs from the Anglophone countries met regularly </p><p>on a bilateral basis and he was interested in expanding the </p><p>participation in these meetings to include Cameroon and Chad. </p><p> Are added that last year there was a call for a joint </p><p>meeting of the chiefs of all the intelligence services in the </p><p>region.  Only four or five attended; Are said that he did not </p><p>believe this effort would be productive until all ECOWAS </p><p>countries participated. During the discussion on regional </p><p>issues, the Ambassador noted that Nigeria might find it </p><p>useful to discuss with some representatives of the Southern </p><p>Africa Development Community (SADC) how SADC managed to build </p><p>its regional institutions.  The Ambassador also expressed </p><p>U.S. support for ECOWAS and its regional efforts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Are also noted that West Africa differs from southern </p><p>Africa because in southern Africa there were several vibrant </p><p>economies, while in West Africa, Nigeria was the only country </p><p>that would pay for international undertakings.  He commented </p><p>that whenever any regional activity is proposed or initiated </p><p>in West Africa, it is always Nigeria who pays the bills. </p><p>Nigeria even pays for the travel of ECOWAS member-state </p><p>officials who come here for training.  He noted it was </p><p>important that the Nigerian National Assembly begin to </p><p>recognize this reality and make funds available to undertake </p><p>these regional responsibilities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) A long and detailed conversation ensued concerning </p><p>Sierra Leone and Liberia.  Are appeared to know all the </p><p>players personally, their whereabouts and their relationships </p><p>to one another.  He noted that Liberian President Charles </p><p>Taylor was a problem, but not the only one.  The SSS Chief </p><p>pointed to the break-down of civil society in Liberia and the </p><p>general attitude of Liberians toward corruption as a means to </p><p>acquire wealth as being the fundamental cause of that </p><p>country\'s problems.  He noted that perhaps the only </p><p>difference between Charles Taylor and ULIMO-K leader Alhaji </p><p>Kromah is that Taylor likes the good life and can lead it </p><p>through his position, while Kromah wants the same good life </p><p>but cannot get at the means of acquiring it.  Are also said </p><p>he believed Taylor would always manage to win an election in </p><p>Liberia because he was perceived by ordinary indigenous </p><p>Liberians as the man who helped get rid of their </p><p>Americo-Liberian oppressors.  He noted that "we need to find </p><p>a way to let Taylor know he can\'t keep it up."  Are also </p><p>noted his concern about the domino-effect of destabilization </p><p>and conflict in West Africa and feared that Cote d,Ivoire </p><p>might be next.  (Note: Interestingly, Are did not place much </p><p>emphasis on Burkinabe President Blaise Campaore\'s role in </p><p>destabilizing the region. End Note.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>================ </p><p>A VOTE OF THANKS </p><p>================ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Ambassador Jeter expressed his appreciation for the </p><p>behind-the-scenes role the SSS has played in facilitating and </p><p>protecting the visits of so many senior American officials </p><p>during the past two years and aiding in the protection of </p><p>U.S. Military Forces in Nigeria (Operation Focus Relief). </p><p>The Ambassador said he hoped that cooperation would continue </p><p>and that it was likely, given the high level of U.S. interest </p><p>in Nigeria, that there would be even more visitors in the </p><p>future. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>======= </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>======= </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) The meeting was unusual for someone in Are\'s position </p><p>as chief of an internal security and intelligence service </p><p>because it was clear he was primarily interested in </p><p>discussing Nigeria\'s domestic and external economic </p><p>situation, the military, and political development in Sierra </p><p>Leone and Liberia.  The explanation may be in the fact that </p><p>Are may have been wearing his board of directors and National </p><p>Security Council hats more than focusing entirely on his own </p><p>agency\'s activities. END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) BIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION: Lateef Kayode Kolawole Are </p><p>is the forty-five year old Director General of the SSS.  He </p><p>took over shortly after Nigerian President Obasanjo was sworn </p><p>in on 29 May 1999.  He has long-standing personal and working </p><p>connections to both President Obasanjo and to Nigerian </p><p>National Security Advisor Aliyu Mohammed.  His wife Angela, </p><p>is a close friend of President Obasanjo\'s wife Stella and </p><p>travels with her on her trips abroad.  He was forced to </p><p>retire from the Nigerian Army as a Lieutenant Colonel during </p><p>the Abacha regime, probably in some part due to his Obasanjo </p><p>and Mohammed connections. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C)  Are is an up-and-comer in the Nigerian Government </p><p>due to his connections and his relatively young age, by </p><p>Nigerian standards for, holding such an important position. </p><p>He is a member of the Nigerian National Security Council and </p><p>sometimes serves as Acting National Security Advisor when </p><p>Aliyu Mohammed travels outside Nigeria.  In addition to his </p><p>being chief of the some twenty thousand members-strong SSS, </p><p>the Nigerian Internal Security and Intelligence Agency, Are </p><p>is also reported to be on the boards of directors of several </p><p>Nigerian banks and corporations.  It is probable that he </p><p>obtained these positions after he became SSS Director </p><p>General.  Embassy personnel observed him several months prior </p><p>to the Obasanjo inauguration, and at the time he appeared to </p><p>be indigent and struggling. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
