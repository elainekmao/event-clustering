<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SANAA 001818 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR NEA DIBBLE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/27/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, YM, IZ, DEMARCHE </p><p>SUBJECT: YEMENI FM QIRBI SUGGESTS IRAQI GOVERNING COUNCIL </p><p>SOLICIT ARAB LEAGUE ACCEPTANCE </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. (A) STATE 215824 AND PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p>     B. (B) MUSCAT 1621 </p><p>     C. (C) SANAA 1788 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edmund J. Hull for reasons 1.5 (b and d) </p><p> </p><p>1. (u) This is an action request.  See comment/request in </p><p>paragraph 5. </p><p> </p><p>2. (c) In a meeting with FM Qirbi on July 27, the Ambassador </p><p>lauded the formation of the IGC and its recent participation </p><p>in the UNSC meeting in New York.  He noted UN SYG Annan\'s </p><p>supportive statements and Special Representative de Mello\'s </p><p>supporting role in helping the IGC to begin the process of </p><p>normalizing Iraq by naming ministers and ambassadors, writing </p><p>a new Constitution and preparing for elections.  He strongly </p><p>urged Yemen to make public statements in support of the IGC </p><p>and provided the talking points in reftel a as a non-paper. </p><p> </p><p>3. (c) In response to the demarche, Qirbi said Iraq is on the </p><p>agenda for the next Arab League ministerial in September and </p><p>indicated that the ROYG would follow the Arab League\'s </p><p>decisions on the IGC,  According to Qirbi, the need for the </p><p>IGC to have backing of the Iraqi people in the form of </p><p>constitutional status was discussed at a meeting of Arab </p><p>League countries and until the formulation of such a </p><p>government, Yemen views the "alliance" (coalition) as being </p><p>the "rulers" of Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>4. (c) In response to the question of whether Iraq would be </p><p>allowed a representative at the League\'s meeting of foreign </p><p>ministers, Qirbi suggested that IGC members might be </p><p>permitted to address the League in their "personal" </p><p>capacities.  He also suggested the need for a "roadmap" for </p><p>how the Arab League and its members will work with the UN to </p><p>benefit Iraq.  He asked whether or not the coalition wants </p><p>Arab participation in resolving Iraq-related issues and what </p><p>Arab countries\' role would be in supporting coalition </p><p>objectives.  Qirbi stated that Yemen sees the key goals as: a </p><p>democratic state with a new Constitution, ending "occupation" </p><p>and re-integrating Iraq into the region. </p><p> </p><p>5. (c) Comment/action request: The upcoming Arab League </p><p>ministerial in September could be an opportunity to gain </p><p>broad Arab acceptance of the IGC, if the UNSC precedent is </p><p>followed.  We recommend that the Department build early </p><p>support among sympathetic Arab League members for such a </p><p>step. End comment/action request. </p><p>HULL </p><p></p></div>
