SULLIVAN FOR REASONS </p><p>1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: ON NOVEMBER 7, AMBASSADOR, ACCOMPANIED </p><p>BY THE DATT, PAID AN INITIAL COURTESY CALL ON DR. SYDNEY </p><p>T. SEKERAMAYI, MINISTER OF DEFENSE, REPUBLIC OF </p><p>ZIMBABWE. AFTER AN OPENING EXCHANGE OF PLEASANTRIES, A </p><p>CORDIAL, RELAXED, AND OPEN CONVERSATION ENSUED </p><p>ENCOMPASSING SEVERAL TOPICS: HUMANITARIAN DEMINING </p><p>PROGRAM, HIV/AIDS, THE LUSAKA ACCORDS, AND FUTURE </p><p>DISENGAGEMENT OF FORCES FROM THE DROC.  ELOQUENT AND </p><p>KNOWLEDGEABLE ON DEFENSE ISSUES, SEKERAMAYI QUESTIONED </p><p>USG POLICY IN THE SOUTHERN AND CENTRAL AFRICAN REGIONS. </p><p>CONCLUDING THE HOUR LONG SESSION WITH A COMPARISON OF </p><p>SAVIMBI AND KAGAME, THE MINISTER OF DEFENSE PROVED AN </p><p>ENGAGING INTERLOCUTOR- A WELCOME DEPARTURE FROM HIS </p><p>ANIMATED BUT LESS THAN SUBSTANTIVE PREDECESSOR, THE LATE </p><p>MOVEN MAHACHI. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) THE MINISTER OF DEFENSE OPENED THE EXCHANGE BY </p><p>NOTING THAT FROM ZIMBABWE\'S INDEPENDENCE, THE GOZ AND </p><p>USG MAINTAINED GOOD RELATIONS AND HELD COMMON POSITIONS </p><p>REGARDING THE FUTURE OF THE SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT </p><p>COMMUNITY (SADC).  SEKERAMAYI PLEDGED THAT HE WOULD </p><p>CONTINUE ALONG THOSE LINES AND AVOID A BREAKDOWN IN </p><p>COMMUNICATIONS.  IN RESPONSE, THE AMBASSADOR EXPRESSED </p><p>HIS APPRECIATION FOR THE ORIENTATION BRIEFINGS AND TOURS </p><p>ORGANIZED BY THE ZIMBABWE DEFENSE FORCES SHORTLY AFTER </p><p>HIS ARRIVAL. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) SEKERAMAYI NEXT LISTED THE VARIOUS INITIATIVES </p><p>AND ENGAGEMENT ACTIVITIES CURRENTLY ONGOING.  MOST </p><p>APPRECIATED WAS THE DEMINING PROGRAM THAT BOTH REDUCED </p><p>SUFFERING AND FREED LAND FOR AGRICULTURAL USE.  IT WAS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03341  01 OF 02  081156Z </p><p>THE "HUMAN FACTOR" THAT HE MOST UNDERSTOOD BECAUSE, AS A </p><p>PHYSICIAN, HE HAD WITNESSED THE PAIN, AGONY, AND TRAUMA </p><p>RESULTING FROM MINE DETONATIONS.  THE MINISTER ALSO </p><p>EXPRESSED THE DESIRE THAT THE CLEARANCE PROCESS BE </p><p>COMPLETED QUICKLY INSTEAD OF HAVING TO "STAGGER" THE </p><p>EFFORT DUE TO RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR NOTED THAT, THE USG IS PREPARED </p><p>TO WORK WITH THE DEFENSE FORCES IN COMBATING HIV/AIDS. </p><p>THE MINISTER WAS VERY RECEPTIVE AND INDICATED THAT THIS </p><p>WAS AN AREA IN WHICH HE AND THE DEFENSE FORCES WELCOME </p><p>COOPERATION.  MOREOVER, SEKERAMAYI NOTED, IT IS THE </p><p>CONSTRAINT ON RESOURCES THAT RETARDS THE SUCCESS OF THE </p><p>CURRENT HIV/AIDS PROGRAM.  HE ASSURED THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>THAT THE APPROPRIATE DEFENSE FORCES OFFICERS WOULD SOON </p><p>CONFER WITH THE DATT REGARDING THIS INITIATIVE. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) NEXT, THE AMBASSADOR ELICITED MINISTER </p><p>SEKERAMAYI\'S PERSPECTIVES ON THE CURRENT SITUATION IN </p><p>THE DROC.  THE MINISTER RESPONDED THAT, SINCE THE EARLY </p><p>1960\'S, THE FORMER ZAIRE HAD NEVER EXPERIENCED PEACE AND </p><p>THAT CONSEQUENTLY STRUCTURES AND INSTITUTIONS WERE NEVER </p><p>BUILT TO SUSTAIN STABILITY.  RELATING EVENTS PRECEDING </p><p>THE DEPLOYMENT OF ZIMBABWEAN TROOPS, SEKERAMAYI NOTED </p><p>THAT PRESIDENT MUSEVENI ASKED ZIMBABWE TO ASSIST IN THE </p><p>REMOVAL OF MOBUTU.  WHEN THAT EVENT OCCURRED, THE </p><p>MINISTER AND THE GOZ BEGAN TO SEE THE CONTRADICTIONS IN </p><p>THE MOTIVES OF BOTH THE UGANDANS AND RWANDANS.  THE GOZ </p><p>WAS IMMEDIATELY SUSPICIOUS OF THE FOREIGN FORCES AND SAW </p><p>THAT THEY INTENDED TO BE AN OCCUPYING FORCE AND TO </p><p>COMMAND THE CONGOLESE ARMY BY USING FOREIGN OFFICERS. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03341  01 OF 02  081156Z </p><p>WHEN THE LATE LAURENT KABILA ASKED FOR ASSISTANCE, THE </p><p>GOZ RESPONDED AND STOPPED THE ADVANCE TO NDJILI AIRPORT </p><p>IN KINSHASA.  THE MINISTER BELIEVES THE GOZ SHOULD BE </p><p>COMMENDED FOR STOPPING THE CARNAGE IN THE DROC. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) SEKERAMAYI THEN ADDRESSED THE CONDITIONS FOR </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN WITHDRAWAL FROM THE DRC. ZIMBABWE, THE </p><p>MINISTER INSISTED, COULD NOT LEAVE A VACUUM IN THE DRC. </p><p>ONCE THE UN IS DEPLOYED, ZIMBABWE WILL LEAVE.  THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR THEN ASKED WHETHER THE GOZ WITHDRAWAL IS </p><p>CONTINGENT UPON THE WITHDRAWAL OF UGANDA AND RWANDA. </p><p>THE GOZ, REPLIED THE MINISTER, IS COMMITTED TO THE </p><p>"FIFO" PRINCIPLE: FIRST IN; FIRST OUT.  MOREOVER, ANY </p><p>POST-LUSAKA ACCORD ROLE FOR THE ZIMBABWE DEFENSE FORCES </p><p>WILL BE DEFINED BY AGREEMENTS WITH THE HOST COUNTRY. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR THEN RAISED THE ISSUE OF </p><p>DEMOBILIZATION AND DISARMAMENT AND THE SCANT LIKELIHOOD </p><p>OF UN FORCES UNDERTAKING AND SUCCESSFULLY ACCOMPLISHING </p><p>THAT MISSION.  ALTHOUGH GOOD NATURED AND NON </p><p>CONFRONTATIONAL, SEKERAMAYI NEVERTHELESS CHIDED THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR WITH, "DON\'T BE DODGY. WHY NOT THE UN?" </p><p>OFFERING AS EXAMPLES THE EVENTS SURROUNDING BOSNIA AND </p><p>THE DAYTON ACCORDS, THE MINISTER POINTED OUT THAT THE UN </p><p>HAD TACKLED MUCH LARGER PROBLEMS.

THE EX-FAR INTERHAMWE WAS, HOWEVER, NOT A PARTY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  03341  02 OF 02  081156Z </p><p>TO THE LUSAKA ACCORD AND THOSE WHO HAD ARMED OR MADE USE </p><p>OF EX-FAR INTERHAMWE HAD TO LEAD UNDER DDR. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) CONCEDING THE POINT, MINISTER SEKERAMAYI </p><p>INSISTED THAT KEGAME AND KABILA MUST BEGIN A DIALOGUE. </p><p>THAT WILL BE THE ONLY WAY TO TRULY COMPLETE THE PEACE </p><p>PROCESS.  ADDRESSING FUTURE SECURITY IN DRC, SEKERAMAYI </p><p>SAID THAT, HISTORICALLY, THE DRC NEVER HAD AN ARMY. </p><p>MOBUTU, HE SAID, "NEVER USED ZAIRIAN FORCES TO CONTAIN </p><p>CONFLICT BUT WOULD CALL ON THE BELGIANS, THE MOROCCANS, </p><p>THE FRENCH...ANYONE, BUT NEVER AN INDIGENOUS FORCE." </p><p>ACCORDING TO THE MINISTER, THERE IS A NEED TO PUT IN </p><p>PLACE A PROGRAM TO TRAIN A CAPABLE NATIONAL ARMY FOR THE </p><p>CONGOLESE PEOPLE. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) CONCLUDING THE SESSION IN SOMEWHAT A DRAMATIC </p><p>FASHION, DR. SEKERAMAYI OFFERED WHAT HE TERMED "FINAL </p><p>FOOD FOR THOUGHT".  CALLING ON THE AMBASSADOR TO RECALL </p><p>HIS POSTING IN ANGOLA, SEKERAMAYI DREW THE COMPARISON OF </p><p>SAVIMBI\'S RELUCTANCE TO TRAVEL TO LUANDA FOR MEETINGS </p><p>OVER ALLEDGED SECURITY CONCERNS. THIS, SAID THE </p><p>MINISTER, IS NO DIFFERENT THAN KAGAME, WHO NEEDED THE </p><p>DRC CONFLICT TO REMAIN IN POWER. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
