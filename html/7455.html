End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Progress on BTC Co\'s Key Concerns </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) BP\'s Turkey BTC Co General Manager, Yashar Latifov, </p><p>told econoff April 15 that important progress has been made </p><p>since BTC Co sent a "material breach" letter to Energy </p><p>Minister Guler on April 7.  The letter, signed by BTC Co CEO </p><p>Michael Townshend, advises the Minister that the GOT is in </p><p>"material breach of its obligations under the Host Government </p><p>Agreement, and, therefore, under the Intergovernmental </p><p>Agreement," due to improper management of the Turkish segment </p><p>of BTC.  Townshend requests that the Minister 1) give BOTAS </p><p>the necessary authority to manage the project; and 2) appoint </p><p>a qualified director of the BTC Directorate, BOTAS\' BTC </p><p>subsidiary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Energy Minister Guler confirmed to Latifov on April 15 </p><p>that progress had been made on both of these requests. </p><p>First, the Minister said, he had designated Fatih Ocali to </p><p>replace the current general manager of the BTC Directorate. </p><p>Latifov told econoff that Ocali was acceptable to BTC Co -- </p><p>he had the right credentials (10 years as BOTAS Deputy </p><p>General Manager, from 1985-1995) and was close to Minister </p><p>Guler.  Minister Guler also said he was working to ensure </p><p>that Ocali would have sufficient authority to implement the </p><p>BTC turnkey contract, but was still figuring out the </p><p>legal/administrative means of achieving this.  Guler told </p><p>Latifov not to worry, "this is a one-party government and we </p><p>will get done what we need to get done."  The BOTAS Board is </p><p>scheduled to approve the appointment of Ocali at its next </p><p>meeting on April 17. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) MFA officials told econoff that they shared many of </p><p>the concerns relayed in the "material breach" letter, and </p><p>they had briefed FM Gul to that effect.  They noted that the </p><p>project already had experienced some delays due to BOTAS\' </p><p>limited authority, but the situation had been exacerbated </p><p>with the dismissals of BOTAS GM Bildaci and Energy U/S </p><p>Yigitguden.  MFA officials said U.S. concern about this issue </p><p>had definitely been registered -- the MFA had reported the </p><p>contents of E/CBED Ambassador Mann\'s letter to Minister Guler </p><p>to the Prime Ministry and to the Presidency.  On the positive </p><p>side, these officials said, the BTC Co and Mann letters had </p><p>caused senior officials to focus on the problem and how to </p><p>resolve it. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) In addition to the steps mentioned above, other recent </p><p>developments may also contribute to resolution of the </p><p>outstanding BTC operational problems.  Over the last week: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- The GOT named Sami Demirbilek as the new Energy </p><p>Undersecretary, replacing Yurdakul Yigitguden; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Minister Guler appointed one of his personal advisors, </p><p>Mehmet Calil, to act as "BTC Coordinator;" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- The Foreign Minister reportedly convened a meeting to </p><p>discuss an action plan for addressing the outstanding </p><p>problems. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Meet the Press </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) The Turkish daily Radikal reported April 13 that BTC </p><p>Co had sent Minister Guler a letter, but got most of the </p><p>other facts wrong.  For example, the article claims that BTC </p><p>Co notified the GOT that the project was three months behind </p><p>schedule, and had instructed the Minister to stop making </p><p>political appointments to BOTAS.  Latifov spent most of April </p><p>14 doing press interviews to respond to the inaccuracies of </p><p>the Radikal article, with positive results:  many of the </p><p>Turkish dailies on April 15 quoted an unnamed BTC Co official </p><p>as stating that BTC construction was not significantly </p><p>delayed in Turkey, and none of the existing problems were </p><p>insurmountable. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) In connection with the BTC Co letter story, at least </p><p>two Turkish dailies have reported that the U.S. no longer </p><p>supports the BTC project since it will soon have access to </p><p>cheap Iraqi oil.  We are responding to these articles, </p><p>reiterating U.S. support for Caspian energy development and </p><p>successful completion of the BTC pipeline. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) BTC Co\'s "material breach" letter, followed by E/CBED </p><p>Amb. Mann\'s letter, seems to have spurred the Turks into </p><p>action.  Guler\'s commitments to BTC Co are promising, but he </p><p>must now translate his words into results.  We will continue </p><p>to monitor the situation closely to ensure that these initial </p><p>steps lead to resolution of the outstanding problems, which </p><p>could seriously jeopardize BTC if left unchecked.  The GOT is </p><p>clearly aware of U.S. interest on this issue, but we will </p><p>meet with the new Energy U/S and the Prime Minister\'s Chief </p><p>Advisor over the next several days to reiterate our concerns, </p><p>and ascertain the GOT\'s action plan for resolving the </p><p>outstanding issues. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
