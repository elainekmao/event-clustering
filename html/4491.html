<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ANKARA 008586 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EUR/SE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/25/2007 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: AK PARTY ANNOUNCES SWEEPING HUMAN RIGHTS REFORM </p><p>PLAN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by DCM Robert Deutsch; reasons 1.5 (b)(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary:  PM Gul announced Nov. 23 a broad plan </p><p>including sweeping legal changes designed to bring Turkey </p><p>into full compliance with EU human rights standards.  The GOT </p><p>is also preparing to introduce a 36-article legislative </p><p>reform package in support of the plan.  The administration </p><p>intends to draft a new constitution, improve the judicial </p><p>system, and combat torture and discrimination.  Gul also </p><p>pledged expanded cooperation with the U.S. and support for </p><p>Cyprus negotiations.  The reform program, rich in substance, </p><p>signals the AK Government\'s determination to govern -- and to </p><p>introduce fundamental and much-needed democratic changes in </p><p>the way political and economic life is conducted and ordered </p><p>in Turkey.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>PM Announces Action Plan </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) PM Gul read out portions of the GOT\'s new "Emergency </p><p>Action Plan" before Parliament Nov. 23.  The plan promises </p><p>sweeping changes to Turkey\'s laws and practices designed to </p><p>quickly meet the EU\'s Copenhagen Criteria.  In the field of </p><p>human rights, elements of the 64-page plan include: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Development of a new, "more pluralist and liberalist" </p><p>constitution, replacing the current 1982 constitution, which </p><p>was drafted in the aftermath of the 1980 military coup and </p><p>contains authoritarian language. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- A broad, government program to end torture and other human </p><p>rights abuses. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Amendments to laws inconsistent with the Copenhagen </p><p>Criteria, the European Convention on Human Rights, or the </p><p>Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and a commitment to </p><p>enforce the law according to the spirit of these conventions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Amendments to laws restricting freedom of expression and </p><p>the right to own property. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Strengthening of civil society and an enhanced role for </p><p>NGOs. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Legal amendments designed to make political parties more </p><p>democratic and transparent. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Legal amendments designed to strengthen the independence </p><p>of the judiciary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Replacing the controversial State Security Courts with a </p><p>new court system for handling terrorism, organized crime, and </p><p>economic crime. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Establishment of more streamlined trial procedures to </p><p>expedite trials. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Elimination of state discrimination in regard to religion, </p><p>race, gender, or political belief. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>Enhanced U.S. Relations, Cyprus Negotiations </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) In addition, Gul said the GOT would build on Turkey\'s </p><p>close strategic and military relations with the U.S. to </p><p>expand cooperation in trade, investment, and technology.  He </p><p>also pledged improved relations with Greece, said a solution </p><p>for Cyprus "has to be found," and welcomed UNSYG Annan\'s </p><p>proposal as a basis for Cyprus negotiations.  Gul\'s comments </p><p>followed statements by AK Party leader Tayyip Erdogan </p><p>November 21 that Turkey\'s EU candidacy was tied to progress </p><p>on Cyprus and ESDI.  Rejecting past GOT refusals to accept </p><p>links among the three issues, Erdogan said, "hawkish policies </p><p>will get us nowhere." (Comment: Erdogan\'s and Gul\'s remarks </p><p>continue to irritate Cyprus hardliners in the press and </p><p>elsewhere -- septel.  End comment). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>Legislative Package in the Wings </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The GOT is also preparing to introduce a 36-article </p><p>legislative reform package in support of the plan.  The </p><p>package has not been released, but according to press reports </p><p>and local EU representatives, it will include: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Expanding the right of retrial pursuant to rulings of the </p><p>European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).  D/PM Yalcinbayir, in </p><p>charge of the human rights portfolio, has indicated the </p><p>amendments would enable currently incarcerated convicts to be </p><p>retried in a Turkish court if the ECHR rules/has ruled in </p><p>their favor. (Note:  In August 2002, Parliament passed an </p><p>amendment allowing for retrial based on ECHR rulings, but the </p><p>measure was not retroactive and would apply only to cases </p><p>brought to the ECHR starting in 2003.  EU representatives </p><p>have criticized the August amendment as inadequate, noting </p><p>that the Copenhagen Criteria specifically require Turkey to </p><p>address the issue of prisoners currently jailed for </p><p>non-violent political activities.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Removing obstacles to prosecuting public servants.  (Note: </p><p>Under current law, prosecutors must obtain the approval of a </p><p>public servant\'s supervisor in order to prosecute. End Note). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Providing an amnesty for students banned from universities </p><p>for demanding education in Kurdish, as well as for those </p><p>banned for wearing Islamic headscarves. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Re-drafting the regulation on minority foundations, making </p><p>it easier for non-Muslim foundations to own property. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Relaxing rules governing the operations of international </p><p>and domestic NGOs. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Revising the Law on Political Parties to make it more </p><p>difficult to close parties. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>Procedural/Timeline Issues </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Two senior AK officials -- one close to Erdogan, the </p><p>other close to Gul -- told us Nov. 25 that there is as yet no </p><p>definite timeline for introducing and passing the reform </p><p>package, nor is it clear yet specifically which of the </p><p>elements of the package will be first on the agenda.  They </p><p>asserted that the AK-dominated Parliament could pass </p><p>"everything" prior to the Dec. 12 EU Copenhagen summit. </p><p>Turhan Comez -- formerly Erdogan\'s Chef de Cabinet, now an </p><p>M.P. from Balikesir -- said that Gul and Erdogan are working </p><p>out the details together, and the process will accelerate </p><p>after Erdogan returns from abroad this week.  Comez also </p><p>noted that the Parliament will soon determine the roster and </p><p>leadership of relevant committees, adding that, with its huge </p><p>majority and "unwavering determination," the AK Government </p><p>will be able to get all of the Copenhagen Criteria-related </p><p>elements of its plan through the legislature by Dec. 12. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) A long-serving Supreme Court Justice told D/Polcouns </p><p>Nov. 22 that in his opinion there are no procedural obstacles </p><p>to rapid passage of AK\'s program.  In terms of the </p><p>formalities of legislative practice, "AK can have all the </p><p>changes it wants in a month without much difficulty," even </p><p>after factoring in procedural details including committee </p><p>assignments and scheduling debates.  The important unresolved </p><p>questions are largely political, he said.  In fact, AK seems </p><p>to be moving relatively slowly in order to protect its flanks </p><p>politically from the elected Parliamentary opposition, the </p><p>bureaucracy, and a suspicious Deep State.  (Note: The Justice </p><p>also thought that Erdogan is happy to have Gul in place as </p><p>P.M. to deflect some of the flak that might be directed at AK </p><p>by the Kemalist Establishment.  However, regarding </p><p>constitutional matters, the Justice asserted that it is </p><p>imperative for the sake of democracy that Erdogan\'s current </p><p>ineligibility for public office be rescinded and that he take </p><p>his place in the formal government as soon as possible. End </p><p>Note). </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) The AK GOT\'s bold new plan is rich in substance.  It </p><p>builds on both the 9-point human rights program Erdogan </p><p>submitted Nov. 6 to EU-member-state Ambassadors, and the </p><p>economic "Emergency Action Plan" he announced Nov. 16.  While </p><p>designed to bolster Turkey\'s EU candidacy, the AK </p><p>Government\'s proactive approach also signals its </p><p>determination to govern Turkey, rather than simply to take </p><p>cues from traditional power centers. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Indeed, the AK Government is trying to introduce </p><p>fundamental and much-needed changes in the way political and </p><p>economic life is conducted and ordered in Turkey.  It is </p><p>staying on message, reiterating a desire to end the </p><p>longstanding Kemalist practice of "guiding" (or interfering </p><p>in) the private lives of Turkish citizens.  The new GOT is </p><p>also insisting on democratizing changes designed to force an </p><p>out of touch Kemalist Establishment to recognize Turkish </p><p>realities -- and accord official respect not only to </p><p>secularist elites, but also to more conservative and other </p><p>"undesirable" elements long relegated to the political, </p><p>social, and economic sidelines. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
