(S/NF)  On March 26, 2003, at approximately 1700, Italian </p><p>Ambassador to Yemen Giacomo San Felice visited Embassy Sanaa </p><p>and called on AMB Hull.  Ambassador San Felice stated that he </p><p>had information regarding an Iraqi IIS operative who intended </p><p>to bomb the U.S. Embassy the following day, March 27. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S/NF)  Following discussion in a meeting including ORCA, </p><p>DCM and RSO, Italians arranged for the suspected IIS </p><p>operative and a friend to come to Embassy Sanaa.  They </p><p>arrived at approximately 1800.  After thorough security </p><p>screening procedures, they entered the Chancery and were </p><p>separately interviewed by ORCA. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S/NF)  RSO provided walk-ins\' cellular phones to Embassy </p><p>assets for exploitation.and will forward the information </p><p>separate channel. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (S/NF)  The walk-in claims to be an IIS asset in command </p><p>of an operational cell.  ORCA finds his claim convincing. </p><p>The man stated he had orders to attack Embassy Sanaa using </p><p>multiple IEDs comprised of 6.8 kg of TNT rigged for timed or </p><p>command detonation.  The Iraqi operative stated that the </p><p>explosives were to be delivered in unspecified packages, </p><p>three with timers and two built for detonation by remote </p><p>control.  The cell realized that the explosions would have </p><p>limited physical effect on the well-fortified Embassy, but </p><p>desired a political effect from the attempt.  The cell also </p><p>undertook surveillance of DATT and PAO residence and Egyptian </p><p>consulate.  The individual has agreed to cooperate, terminate </p><p>the attack and turn over cell members and explosives. </p><p>Further details will be provided via ORCA reporting, </p><p>including knowledge of attacks in 11 other countries. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (S/NF)  Based on information provided by the walk-in, </p><p>ORCA arranged with ROYG Political Security Organization (PSO) </p><p>to seize the explosive devices and the three other members of </p><p>the attack cell evening of March 26.  Accordingly, RSO </p><p>believes the attack plan outlined in this report has been </p><p>thwarted. </p><p> </p><p>7. (S/NF)  RSO will brief Embassy security assets to be </p><p>vigilant regarding methods of explosive delivery with use of </p><p>timers or remote control devices.  Post will decide on </p><p>appropriate follow-on security measures. </p><p> </p><p>HULL </p><p></p></div>
