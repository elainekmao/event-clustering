<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 002477 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/19/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAL, XF, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDANIANS SAY UN ISSUES NOT ON AGENDA FOR BEIRUT </p><p>MINISTERIAL </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 94509 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM Gregory L. Berry for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  DCM reviewed ref points May 17 with Ali al-Ayed, </p><p>personal assistant to Foreign Minister Muasher, asking that </p><p>Jordan oppose any move at the May 17-18 Beirut Arab League </p><p>Meeting to call publicly for challenges to Israeli </p><p>credentials in international organizations or support for </p><p>Chapter VII action against Israel in the UNSC.  These </p><p>efforts, DCM argued, run counter to the spirit of the Arab </p><p>peace initiative.  Ayed undertook to pass these points to </p><p>FonMin Muasher. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  Later on May 17, Ayed contacted DCM to say that he </p><p>had reached Muasher before his departure for Beirut.  Ayed </p><p>said the Minister was surprised by the U.S. demarche, since </p><p>he understood the agenda in Beirut to be focused on core </p><p>issues.  He was not aware that the issues we raised were to </p><p>be discussed at all.  That said, he assured us that Jordan </p><p>would work for a moderate outcome if the issues came up. </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
