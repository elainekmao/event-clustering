<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 003039 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR AF: PDAS BELLAMY, PAS PERRY; AF/W BOOTH, </p><p>AF/RA BITTRICK </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/27/2011 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MOPS, MASS, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: PLAN FOR DEPLOYMENT TO BURUNDI </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter.  Reasons 1.5 (b) </p><p>and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1 (C)  Summary:  During a November 23 evening meeting with </p><p>Ambassador Jeter, Minister of State Lawal Batagarawa </p><p>reaffirmed that the GON remained committed to deploy troops </p><p>to Burundi to assist the implementation of the transitional </p><p>arrangement between the Buyoya government and moderate Hutu </p><p>politicians.  Batagarawa admitted that the work-out brokered </p><p>by President Mandela was frail, but worth trying.  Mandela, </p><p>according to Batagarawa, had not only arm-twisted Buyoya and </p><p>the Hutu politicians to work with each other, but also </p><p>cajoled Obasanjo to deploy troops into what could potentially </p><p>be harm\'s way.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  Batagarawa stated that the third Operation Focus </p><p>Relief (OFR)battalion had been tentatively ear-marked to </p><p>deploy to Burundi, satisfying Obasanjo\'s commitment to </p><p>Mandela.  (We have subsequently learned that a non-OFR </p><p>battalion has now been selected.)  The Minister of State </p><p>believed the Nigerian mission would be tripartite.  Pursuant </p><p>to the Mandela-brokered agreement Buyoya would be the </p><p>transitional President for 18 months with a Hutu Vice </p><p>President; after that period, the offices would rotate for an </p><p>equal duration,  with the Hutus gaining the Presidency and </p><p>the Tutsi taking the second chair.  Given the extremist Hutu </p><p>and Tutsi opposition to the transitional compromise, </p><p>participating Hutu politicians, many of whom are exiles, </p><p>required security protection once in Burundi.  This </p><p>protective detail would be the first element of Nigeria\'s </p><p>peace mission. The South African\'s contingent, which was </p><p>already deployed, was focusing heavily on this aspect of the </p><p>mission. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  As part of the transitional agreement, Burundi\'s army </p><p>would be reconfigured to achieve equal proportions of Hutu </p><p>and Tutsi throughout the ranks.  Given the Tutsi\'s numerical </p><p>inferiority, Batagarawa termed this a "good deal" for the </p><p>Tutsi.  If the Army\'s composition were to parallel the ethnic </p><p>distribution in Burundi\'s general population, the Hutu\'s </p><p>would predominate and eventually overrun the Tutsi, he </p><p>suggested.  Thus, the second part of the mission would be </p><p>restructuring and training the new, ethnically balanced army. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  Traditional peacekeeping would be the third element </p><p>of the mission, according to Batagarawa.  With the army being </p><p>drawn to the barracks for the restructuring, there will be a </p><p>security vacuum throughout the country.  As the Nigerian, </p><p>South African and other troops deploy to different areas of </p><p>the country, security would devolve to them, he predicted. </p><p>Acknowledging the upsurge in fighting that followed the </p><p>November 1 inauguration of the transition, Batagarawa hoped </p><p>that events on the ground would not force a change from a </p><p>traditional peacekeeping presence to a more robust </p><p>peacemaking posture. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  Given Burundi\'s difficult political terrain and the </p><p>nature of the tasks assigned to the force,  Batagarawa could </p><p>not estimate how long the deployment would last.  The figure </p><p>of six months had been bandied about, but the Minister of </p><p>State dismissed that as diplomatic slight-of-hand, a figure </p><p>used to dampen opposition to the deployment and to engender </p><p>confidence by promoting the idea that peace is on the fast </p><p>track.  However, Batagarawa argued, the job of restructuring </p><p>the army would be impossible to accomplish within that time </p><p>period. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C)  Batagarawa went on to state that the EU and Belgians </p><p>have promised to help fund the deployment of the African </p><p>contingents to Burundi.  The Dutch had also expressed an </p><p>interest in supporting Burundi peace deployments, he </p><p>believed.  Batagarawa said that while Nigeria had not asked </p><p>for any financial assistance to help fund its deployment, he </p><p>was sure Ghana and Senegal, the other two participating </p><p>states, would require and ask for financial and other help </p><p>before deploying troops. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C)  While Batagarawa did not seek funding for this </p><p>specific mission, he mentioned that Nigeria needed financial </p><p>relief to continue active participation in multiple </p><p>peacekeeping operations.  Batagarawa raised the idea that </p><p>donor nations provide Nigeria debt relief in proportion to </p><p>Nigeria\'s outlays for peacekeeping.  He said that Nigeria, in </p><p>participating in these far-flung operations, not only helped </p><p>to stabilize Africa, but was "doing the dirty work" that no </p><p>Western country wanted to do.  While these efforts were in </p><p>Nigeria\'s interest as well, he felt the West should give </p><p>Nigeria credit for its peacekeeping endeavors.  By receiving </p><p>debt relief, the GON could silence critics of Obasanjo\'s </p><p>foreign policy by showing that Nigeria\'s strategic </p><p>cooperation with the west, particularly the U.S., has </p><p>produced practical dividends. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C)  According to Batagarawa, the Burundi deployment is </p><p>imminent.  While cognizant of the logistical and other </p><p>challenges of such a distant deployment in a harsh, unknown </p><p>environment, the Nigerians seem committed to fulfilling the </p><p>President\'s pledge to Mandela.  This deployment is not only a </p><p>manifestation of Obasanjo\'s personalized diplomacy but, with </p><p>some prodding by Mandela also of his foreign policy vision of </p><p>Nigeria as a leading player in advancing continental </p><p>stability. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
