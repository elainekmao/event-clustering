STILL, THE DUTCH PREDICT HARD </p><p>SLOGGING WITH KUALA LUMPUR IF BETTER NON-PROLIFERATION EXPORT </p><p>CONTROLS ARE EVER TO BE REALIZED. THEY ARE MUCH MORE POSITIVE </p><p>ABOUT THE PROSPECTS IN SINGAPORE, HONG KONG AND MACAU. </p><p>FINALLY, THE DUTCH FOREIGN MINISTER SEEMS TO HAVE SAID </p><p>NOTHING MISSILE-SPECIFIC IN HIS BRIEF DISCUSSIONS ABOUT WMD </p><p>ISSUES WHEN MEETING IRANIAN FM KHARAZZI IN TEHRAN. THE </p><p>IRANIANS HAVE YET TO RESPOND TO THE DUTCH PROPOSAL, MADE TWO </p><p>WEEKS AGO, FOR A MTCR VISIT TO TEHRAN ON OR ABOUT SEPTEMBER </p><p>1.

THE TEAM ALSO MADE USE OF THE </p><p>OPPORTUNITY OF BEING IN ASIA TO VISIT MALAYSIA, IN ACCORDANCE </p><p>WITH THE INTERSESSIONAL REQUEST TO THIS EFFECT, AS ORIGINALLY </p><p>TABLED BY THE U.S. AND RUSSIAN FEDERATION (RF). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>IN ADDITION TO THE ACTING CHAIRMAN AND THE REPRESENTATIVES </p><p>FROM THE NETHERLANDS CHAIR, THE MTCR TEAM INCLUDED </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES FROM FINLAND (IN THE PERSON OF THE FUTURE </p><p>CHAIRMAN HIMSELF) AND JAPAN, AND WAS JOINED AT A LOCAL LEVEL </p><p>BY REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE AUSTRALIAN AND NEW ZEALAND </p><p>MISSIONS IN THE FOUR CAPITALS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ASIDE FROM THE MORE GENERAL AIM OF DISCUSSING AND RAISING </p><p>AWARENESS OF THE DANGERS OF MISSILE PROLIFERATION AND OF </p><p>SUPPLYING INFORMATION ON THE WAYS THE MTCR ADDRESSES SUCH </p><p>CONCERNS, THE VISITS TO SINGAPORE, HONG KONG AND MACAU WERE </p><p>USED TO FOCUS SPECIFIC ATTENTION ON THE ROLE THAT </p><p>TRANSSHIPMENT CENTERS CAN PLAY IN ACQUISITION EFFORTS BY </p><p>PROLIFERATORS TO OBTAIN MISSILES AND/OR SENSITIVE TECHNOLOGY </p><p>THAT CAN BE USED FOR THEIR MISSILE PROGRAMS.  INTERLOCUTORS </p><p>WERE ENCOURAGED TO ADHERE TO THE MTCR GUIDELINES, WITH A VIEW </p><p>TO COUNTER THESE DANGERS, AND WERE OFFERED ASSISTANCE BY MTCR </p><p>PARTNERS IN BUILDING UP AND FURTHER STRENGTHENING THEIR </p><p>EXPORT AND  TRANSSHIPMENT CONTROLS.  IN THIS FRAMEWORK AN </p><p>OVERVIEW WAS GIVEN OF THE NETHERLANDS EXPORT AND </p><p>TRANSSHIPMENT CONTROL SYSTEM BY WAY OF AN EXAMPLE OF THE MTCR </p><p>GUIDELINES, ALONG WITH SIMILAR UNDERTAKINGS OF A POLITICALLY </p><p>BINDING NATURE IN THE FRAMEWORK OF OTHER EXPORT CONTROL </p><p>REGIMES ARE INCORPORATED INTO NATIONAL LAW.  IT WAS STRESSED </p><p>THAT THIS WAS BY NO MEANS A BLUEPRINT FOR THE IDEAL CONTROL </p><p>SYSTEM, AND THAT IT WAS OF COURSE UP TO THE MTCR PARTNERS TO </p><p>DECIDE HOW TO IMPLEMENT AND INCORPORATE THE MTCR UNDERTAKINGS </p><p> AT A NATIONAL LEVEL, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIR OWN </p><p>LEGISLATION AND RESOURCES. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INTERSESSIONAL MANDATE FOR THE VISIT </p><p>TO MALAYSIA, THE TALKS WITH THE AUTHORITIES IN KUALA LUMPUR </p><p>HAD A MORE GENERAL BEARING, AND NO SPECIAL FOCUS WAS GIVEN TO </p><p>TRANSSHIPMENT ISSUES, ALTHOUGH THE SUBJECT WAS, UNAVOIDABLY, </p><p>TOUCHED UPON IN THE COURSE OF THE DISCUSSIONS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SINGAPORE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>IN SINGAPORE THE MTCR MISSION WAS RECEIVED BY A DELEGATION </p><p>LED BY MRS. KHENG HUA ISELI, DIRECTOR FOR INTERNATIONAL </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS OF THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND </p><p>COMPRISING OFFICIALS FROM THE MFA, THE MINISTRY OF TRADE AND </p><p>INDUSTRY, THE MINISTRY OF DEFENSE, THE TRADE DEVELOPMENT </p><p>BOARD, AND THE CUSTOMS AND EXCISE DEPARTMENT.  THE FULL </p><p>DELEGATION LIST IS ANNEXED FOR PARTNERS\' INFORMATION. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>THE SINGAPORE AUTHORITIES WELCOMED THE VISIT OF THE MTCR </p><p>MISSION AND STRESSED THEIR COUNTRY\'S GENERAL SUPPORT FOR THE </p><p>NON PROLIFERATION AIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE MTCR.  THEY </p><p>UNDERLINED THAT SINGAPORE FROM ITS PART HAD AN ADEQUATE </p><p>SYSTEM OF CONTROLS, BASED ON ITS IMPORT CERTIFICATE AND </p><p>DELIVERY VERIFICATION (IC/DV) SYSTEM, REQUIRING PERMITS FOR </p><p>THE IM-AND EXPORT OF STRATEGIC GOODS TO AND FROM SINGAPORE. </p><p>HOWEVER, AS A COUNTRY THAT IS ENTIRELY DEPENDENT ON TRADE, </p><p>SINGAPORE WAS FORCED TO STRIKE A BALANCE BETWEEN ITS </p><p>COMMERCIAL INTERESTS AND ITS CONTROLS ON TRADE.  TOO RIGID A </p><p>CONTROL SYSTEM COULD RUN COUNTER TO THOSE COMMERCIAL </p><p>INTERESTS.  IN THIS FRAMEWORK IT WAS EXPLAINED THAT </p><p>TRANSACTIONS ARE ONLY CONTROLLED WHEN A SINGAPOREAN ENTITY IS </p><p>INVOLVED IN THE DEAL, AS A CONSIGNOR OR A CONSIGNEE.  AS A </p><p>RULE, THEREFORE, TRANSSHIPMENT FLOWS FROM A FOREIGN CONSIGNOR </p><p>TO A FOREIGN CONSIGNEE ARE NOT CONTROLLED, IRRESPECTIVE OF </p><p>WHETHER THE GOODS REMAIN ON BOARD OR ARE DOWNLOADED AT THE </p><p>SINGAPORE HARBOR/AIRPORT.  IN THE VIEW OF SINGAPORE IT WAS </p><p>PRIMARILY THE EXPORTING COUNTRY\'S RESPONSIBILITY (AND HENCE </p><p>NOT THE TRANSSHIPMENT COUNTRIES\') TO CONTROL THAT SENSITIVE </p><p>GOODS WOULD NOT FALL INTO WRONG HANDS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>THE CHAIR, FROM HIS SIDE, STRESSED THE VIEW THAT </p><p>NON-PROLIFERATION IS A SHARED RESPONSIBILITY OF ALL PARTIES </p><p>CONCERNED; EXPORTING COUNTRIES COULD NOT DO IT ALONE, THE </p><p>CO-OPERATION OF TRANSSHIPMENT CENTERS WAS ALSO ESSENTIAL.  A </p><p>PEACEFUL AND STABLE ENVIRONMENT WAS A CONDITIO SINE QUA NON </p><p>FOR TRADE.  THEREFORE, THERE WAS NO QUESTION OF CHOOSING </p><p>BETWEEN STRICT CONTROLS AND COMMERCIAL INTERESTS, THE TWO </p><p>SHOULD GO HAND IN HAND. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>IN THIS CONTEXT THE QUESTION WAS PUT TO THE SINGAPORE </p><p>AUTHORITIES WHETHER SINGAPORE WOULD BE WILLING AND ABLE TO </p><p>CONTROL TRANSSHIPMENT CONSIGNMENTS ON REQUEST OF A FOREIGN </p><p>GOVERNMENT IN CASE OF SUSPICION OF DEVIATION TO UNDESIRABLE </p><p>DESTINATIONS, AND WOULD BE ABLE TO SEIZE SUCH SHIPMENTS, IF </p><p>THE SUSPICIOUS PROVED JUSTIFIED.  THE REPLY WAS THAT THERE </p><p>WAS NO LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR STOPPING SUCH TRANSSHIPMENT </p><p>CONSIGNMENTS, BUT THAT IN SUCH CASES COOPERATION OF THE </p><p>SHIPPING AGENCY COULD BE SOUGHT ON THE BASIS OF PERSUASION. </p><p>IT WAS STATED THAT, IN PRACTICE, THIS APPROACH HAD BEEN </p><p>SUCCESSFUL. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>WHEN ASKED WHETHER THE SINGAPORE AUTHORITIES WERE PLANNING TO </p><p>REVIEW THEIR EXPORT AND TRANSSHIPMENT CONTROLS AND WOULD, FOR </p><p>INSTANCE, CONTEMPLATE INTRODUCING A CATCH-ALL OR AD-HOC </p><p>MECHANISM FOR THE LICENSING OF TRANSSHIPMENT TRANSACTIONS, </p><p>SIMILAR TO THE NETHERLANDS EXAMPLE, THE SINGAPORE </p><p>INTERLOCUTORS AGAIN POINTED OUT THAT THEY BELIEVED THE </p><p>CURRENT CONTROL SYSTEM WAS ADEQUATE AND ALLOWED SINGAPORE TO </p><p>ENACT ITS INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS.  AT THE SAME TIME, </p><p>HOWEVER, THEY DID EXPRESS AN INTEREST IN THE WORKING OF THE </p><p>AD HOC LICENSING SYSTEM, AND WOULD LIKE TO RECEIVE SOME </p><p>FEEDBACK ON ITS FUNCTIONING IN PRACTICES. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>THE CHAIR INDICATED THE READINESS OF THE MTCR TO SUPPLY </p><p>SINGAPORE WITH ALL RELEVANT INFORMATION AND SUPPORT, AND </p><p>PROPOSED ESTABLISHING A FRAMEWORK FOR FUTURE CONTACTS ON A </p><p>MORE REGULAR BASIS AND THROUGH THE INTERMEDIARY OF A FIXED </p><p>POINT OF CONTACT ON BOTH SIDES.  ALTHOUGH SINGAPORE DID NOT </p><p>REJECT CONTINUATION OF THE DIALOGUE, ITS RESPONSE TO THIS </p><p>PROPOSAL WAS RATHER EVASIVE, INDICATING THAT DIPLOMATIC </p><p>CHANNELS COULD BE USED IF AND WHEN THERE WAS ANY SPECIFIC </p><p>NEED FOR FURTHER CONTACTS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>THE VISIT OF THE MTCR TEAM LARGELY REAFFIRMED THE IMPRESSIONS </p><p>OF THE JAPANESE COLLEAGUES AFTER THEIR BILATERAL DIALOGUE </p><p>EARLIER THIS YEAR (POC DOC 19, OF FEBRUARY 2000):  SINGAPORE </p><p>EXERCISES A LIMITED CONTROL ON EXPORTS OF STRATEGIC GOODS </p><p>FORM ITS TERRITORY, ON THE BASIS OF A BY NO MEANS </p><p>COMPREHENSIVE LIST OF SENSITIVE ITEMS.  TRANSSHIPMENT IS, AS </p><p>A RULE, NOT CONTROLLED AT ALL.  BECAUSE ITS BASIC PERCEPTION </p><p>STILL SEEMS TO BE THAT RIGOROUS CONTROLS WOULD HAMPER </p><p>COMMERCIAL INTERESTS, IT DOES NOT SEEM TO BE VERY WILLING TO </p><p>IMPROVE ITS CONTROL SYSTEM.  HOWEVER, AS ALREADY INDICATED, </p><p>THERE SEEMS TO BE AN INTEREST IN A CATCH-ALL, AD-HOC </p><p>LICENSING MECHANISM, WHICH COULD BE EMPLOYED IN CASES WHERE </p><p>INDICATIONS ARE RECEIVED OF EXPORT/TRANSSHIPMENT TO COUNTRIES </p><p>OF CONCERN. </p><p>HONG KONG </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>IN HONG KONG THE MTCR MISSION WAS RECEIVED BY A DELEGATION </p><p>LED BY MISS YVONNE CHOI, DEPUTY SECRETARY FOR TRADE AND </p><p>INDUSTRY.  THE MEMBERS OF THE DELEGATION INCLUDED MISS ELIZA </p><p>LEE, ASSISTANT DIRECTOR GENERAL OF THE TRADE DEPARTMENT, AND </p><p>MR. ANDREW WONG, HEAD OF TRADE CONTROLS, CUSTOMS AND EXCISE </p><p>DEPARTMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MISS CHOI EXPRESSED HER GREAT APPRECIATION FOR THIS FIRST </p><p>OFFICIAL MTCR VISIT TO HONG KONG, WHICH WOULD GIVE THE </p><p>MEMBERS OF THE MISSION AN OPPORTUNITY TO SEE THE FUNCTIONING </p><p>OF THE HONG KONG CONTROL SYSTEM WITH THEIR OWN EYES.  HONG </p><p>KONG GREATLY VALUED SUCH EXCHANGES OF VIEWS, AND WELCOMED A </p><p>FURTHER ENHANCEMENT OF THE TIES WITH THE MTCR IN THE FUTURE. </p><p>THE MTCR TEAM RECEIVED PRESENTATIONS OF THE - IMPRESSIVE - </p><p>HONG KONG CONTROL SYSTEM ON IM-AND EXPORT, AND TRANSSHIPMENT </p><p>OF STRATEGIC GOODS.  SERVICES, INCLUDING BROKERING, IN THE </p><p>CONTEXT OF WMD PROGRAMS ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO LICENSING </p><p>REQUIREMENTS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ON THE BASIS OF CONTROL LISTS, WHICH MIRROR THE LISTS OF THE </p><p>EXPORT CONTROL REGIMES, AND WHICH ARE REGULARLY UPDATED, </p><p>SHIPMENTS ARE STRINGENTLY CONTROLLED BY THE HONG KONG </p><p>AUTHORITIES.  FOR EACH TRANSACTION AN INDIVIDUAL LICENSE IS </p><p>REQUIRED.  FOR RE-EXPORT FROM HONG KONG, AT ALL TIMES AN END </p><p>USE CERTIFICATE AND A RE-EXPORT AUTHORIZATION BY THE </p><p>EXPORTING STATE ARE REQUIRED, TOGETHER WITH AN ACCEPTANCE OF </p><p>THE POSSIBILITY OF END USE CHECKS.  IN THIS WAY THE HONG KONG </p><p>CONTROLS COMPLEMENT THE EXPORT CONTROLS OF THE ORIGINAL </p><p>EXPORTING COUNTRY.  BOTH THE CONSIGNOR, THE CONSIGNEE, AS </p><p>WELL AS THE TRANSPORTER ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR UPHOLDING THE </p><p>LAW:  "ANYBODY WHO HAS A HAND IN THE TRANSACTION CAN BE HELD </p><p>ACCOUNTABLE."  IN ORDER TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE, THE HONG KONG </p><p>AUTHORITIES HAVE EXTENSIVE POWERS OF ENFORCEMENT, TO THE </p><p>POINT THAT, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF DOMESTIC PREMISES, SEARCHES </p><p>MAY BE EFFECTED WITHOUT CUSTOMS ORDER. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>VIS-A-VIS THE PRC, HONG KONG MAINTAINS STRICT AUTONOMY AS </p><p>REGARDS ITS TRADE CONTROLS:  TRADE FLOWS ACROSS THE PRC-HONG </p><p>KONG BORDER ARE SUBJECT TO THE SAME LICENSING REQUIREMENTS </p><p>AND CONTROLS AS TRADE WITH OTHER COUNTRIES.  EVEN PLA </p><p>VEHICLES ARE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT ONE WEEK\'S ADVANCE </p><p>NOTIFICATION WITH PARTICULARS ON PERSONNEL AND GOODS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>IT WAS UNDERLINED THAT HONG KONG\'S COMMITMENT OT STRINGENT </p><p>LICENSING AND CONTROLS WAS BORN OUT OF SELF INTEREST.  IF </p><p>HONG KONG WANTS TO MAINTAIN ITS POSITION AS HIGH TECH HUB, IT </p><p>NEEDS TO ENSURE THAT IT CAN ACQUIRE THE NECESSARY INFLOW OF </p><p>TECHNOLOGY FROM ITS TRADING PARTNERS, AND THIS IS ONLY </p><p>POSSIBLE IF THOSE PARTNERS CONTINUE TO HAVE FULL CONFIDENCE </p><p>IN ITS EXPORT CONTROLS, SO AS TO BE SURE THAT THAT TECHNOLOGY </p><p>IS NOT RE-EXPORTED T UNDUE DESTINATIONS.  SINCE ITS REVERSION </p><p>TO CHINA, HONG KONG UNFORTUNATELY NO LONGER FORMED PART OF </p><p>THE EXPORT CONTROL REGIMES, BUT IT WAS DETERMINED TO CONTINUE </p><p>TO LIVE UP TO THE EXPORT REGIMES GUIDELINES AND STANDARDS. </p><p>FORTUNATELY, IT RECEIVED ADEQUATE INFORMATION AND HELP FROM </p><p>PARTNERS TO ENABLE IT TO DO SO. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>THE DISCUSSIONS WERE COMPLEMENTED WITH VISITS TO THE LOK MA </p><p>CHAU BORDER CONTROL POINT WITH THE PRC, AND THE CUSTOMS AND </p><p>EXCISE DEPARTMENT OF THE HONG KONG INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>IN CONCLUSION, THE MTCR TEAM RECEIVED A VERY FAVORABLE </p><p>IMPRESSION OF THE HONG KONG TRADE CONTROL SYSTEM, WHICH CAN </p><p>SERVE AS AN EXAMPLE FOR OTHER TRANSSHIPMENT CENTERS IN THE </p><p>WORLD.  HONG KONG HAS BEEN VERY ACTIVE IN ADVERTISING ITS </p><p>CONTROL SYSTEM, INTER ALIA THROUGH NUMEROUS PRESENTATIONS AT </p><p>EXPORT CONTROL SEMINARS, ETC.  FOR THE INFORMATION OF </p><p>PARTNERS, A COPY OF AN OUTLINE OF THE SYSTEM IS ANNEXED. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ONE POINT OF CONCERN WOULD SEEM TO BE THE FACT THAT NOT ALL </p><p>IN-TRANSIT CONSIGNMENTS OF SENSITIVE GOODS CAN BE CONTROLLED </p><p>AND SEIZED, EVEN IN CASE OF HARD EVIDENCE OF UNDUE GOINGS ON. </p><p> THIS IS ON ACCOUNT OF THE FACT THAT FOR IN TRANSIT CONTROLS </p><p>A SHORT LIST OF VERY SENSITIVE ITEMS ("SCHEDULE 2") IS USED, </p><p>AS OPPOSED TO THE COMPREHENSIVE LIST ("SCHEDULE 1") USED FOR </p><p>IM AND EXPORT CONTROLS, AS WELL CONTROLS OF TRANSSHIPMENT </p><p>INVOLVING UNLOADING OF THE GOODS.  IN THIS RESPECT, THE HONG </p><p>KONG SHOWED AN ACTIVE INTEREST IN THE CATCH-ALL  AD HOC </p><p>LICENSING MECHANISM AS INCORPORATED IN THE NETHERLANDS EXPORT </p><p>AND TRANSSHIPMENT CONTROL SYSTEM. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>IT WAS AGREED THAT DIRECT CONTACTS BETWEEN THE MTCR AND HONG </p><p>KONG WILL BE INTENSIFIED, AND TO THIS END FORMAL POINTS OF </p><p>CONTACT WILL BE ESTABLISHED ON BOTH SIDES. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MACAU </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>IN MACAU, THE MTCR DELEGATION WAS RECEIVED BY A DELEGATION </p><p>HEADED BY MR. ANTONIO PEDRO, ADVISER TO THE SECRETARY FOR </p><p>ADMINISTRATION AND JUSTICE.  THE MACAU DELEGATION FURTHER </p><p>INCLUDED REPRESENTATIVES OF THE OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY OF </p><p>ECONOMY AND FINANCE, THE MARINE AND CUSTOMS POLICE, AND THE </p><p>ECONOMIC SERVICES. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>IT WAS EXPLAINED THAT THE MACAU GOVERNMENT WAS IN THE PROCESS </p><p>OF SETTING UP A NEW, SINGLE CUSTOMS ENTITY WHICH WOULD BE IN </p><p>CHARGE OF TRADE CONTROLS.  FOR THE TIME BEING, MACAU RELIED </p><p>ON A DUAL SYSTEM WHEREBY THE TECHNICAL ADMINISTRATION WAS </p><p>CARRIED OUT BY THE ECONOMIC SERVICES AND THE CONTROLS ON </p><p>TRADE WERE CARRIED OUT BY THE MARINE AND CUSTOMS POLICE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HAVING SAID THIS, WHAT FOLLOWED AS A DESCRIPTION OF WHAT </p><p>SEEMS A RATHER WEAK LICENSING AND CONTROL SYSTEM.  WITHOUT </p><p>GOING INTO DETAILS - THESE WERE NOT SUPPLIED - IT WOULD SEEM </p><p>THAT THIS SYSTEM ONLY APPLIES TO THE IM AND EXPORT OF A SHORT </p><p>LIST OF "CONVENTIONAL ARMS, MILITARY VEHICLES AND </p><p>AMMUNITION."  CONTROL WAS DESCRIBED AS STRICT, AND EASILY </p><p>ENFORCEABLE, DUE TO THE LIMITED VOLUMES OF GOODS INVOLVED. </p><p>THE SYSTEM, HOWEVER, DOES NOT APPLY TO DUAL USE GOODS, NOR TO </p><p>TRANSSHIPMENT FLOWS.  THE AUTHORITIES WERE AWARE THAT THEY </p><p>SYSTEM WAS FAR FROM PERFECT, BUT MENTIONED THAT MACAU ONLY </p><p>HAD A SMALL HARBOR, WHICH WAS HARDLY SUITABLE FOR THE </p><p>TRANSSHIPMENT OF LARGE CONSIGNMENTS OF ILLICIT GOODS.  UNTIL </p><p>1995 THERE HAS ALSO NOT BEEN AN AIRPORT, AND AT THE MOMENT </p><p>THE NEW AIRPORT WAS NOT USED TO CAPACITY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>IN THE LIGHT OF THE REVERSION TO THE PRC, THE MACAU </p><p>AUTHORITIES HAD HAD TO GIVE PRIORITY TO OTHER URGENT NEEDS. </p><p>HOWEVER, THEY WERE CONSCIOUS OF THEIR INTERNATIONAL </p><p>RESPONSIBILITIES IN THE FIELD OF NON PROLIFERATION, AND WERE </p><p>WILLING TO IMPROVE THEIR CONTROLS.  FOR THIS, HOWEVER, THEY </p><p>NEEDED ASSISTANCE AND INFORMATION FORM THE MTCR PARTNERS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>THE MTCR TEAM, IN RESPONSE, URGED THE MACAU AUTHORITIES TO </p><p>AFFORD AS MUCH PRIORITY AS POSSIBLE TO STRENGTHENING THEIR </p><p>EXPORT CONTROLS, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THAT TRADE VOLUMES COULD </p><p>BE EXPECTED TO INCREASE OVER THE COMING YEARS, AND ALSO </p><p>SEEING THE FACT THAT CERTAIN INDICATIONS HAD BEEN RECEIVED </p><p>THAT NORTH KOREA WAS ALREADY USING MACAU AS A TRANSSHIPMENT </p><p>CENTER.  THE MTCR OFFERED ALL NECESSARY ASSISTANCE TO MACAU </p><p>IN THIS RESPECT.  IN PARTICULAR, JAPAN PROPOSED THAT THE </p><p>JAPANESE EXPORT CONTROLS EXPERT, WHO WAS CURRENTLY ASSISTING </p><p>THE HONG KONG AUTHORITIES, WOULD PAY A VISIT TO MACAU AFTER </p><p>THE COMPLETION OF HIS TASKS IN JULY.  THIS PROPOSAL WAS </p><p>GRATEFULLY ACCEPTED.  IT WAS DECIDED TO APPOINT MR. NG KUOK </p><p>HENG, ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER OF THE MACAU MARINE AND CUSTOMS </p><p>POLICE AS POINT OF CONTACT FOR FUTURE CONTACTS WITH THE MTCR. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FOLLOWING THIS MEETING, THE MTCR DELEGATION WAS ALSO RECEIVED </p><p>BY THE SECRETARY OF SECURITY OF THE MACAU SAR, MR. CHEONG </p><p>KUOC VA, WHO EXPRESSED HIS APPRECIATION FOR THE MTCR VISIT </p><p>AND REAFFIRMED MACAU\'S WILLINGNESS TO WORK TOGETHER WITH THE </p><p>MTCR TO IMPROVE ITS CONTROLS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ALL IN ALL, THE MTCR TEAM ESTABLISHED THAT MACAU CURRENTLY </p><p>DOES NOT HAVE AN ADEQUATE EXPORT AND TRANSSHIPMENT CONTROL </p><p>SYSTEM.  IT IS CONSCIOUS OF THIS FACT AND IS ALSO WILLING TO </p><p>STRENGTHEN ITS CONTROLS IN COOPERATION WITH THE MTCR AND </p><p>OTHER EXPORT CONTROL REGIMES.  IT HAS, HOWEVER, BEEN FORCED </p><p>TO GIVE PRIORITY TO OTHER MATTERS FIRST.  HERE OBVIOUSLY LIES </p><p>A TASK FOR MTCR PARTNERS.  AS STATED, A JAPANESE EXPORT </p><p>CONTROLS EXPERT WILL VISIT MACAU SHORTLY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MALAYSIA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>AS STATED, THE MTCR TEAM MADE USE OF ITS PRESENCE IN ASIA TO </p><p>ALSO VISIT KUALA LUMPUR.  THE DELEGATION WAS RECEIVED BY A </p><p>DELEGATION OF OFFICIALS FROM THE MINISTRIES OF FOREIGN </p><p>AFFAIRS AND DEFENSE, HEADED BY MR. G. HUSSEIN BIN G. HANIFF, </p><p>UNDER SECRETARY FOR MULTILATERAL AND POLITICAL AFFAIRS OF THE </p><p>MFA. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>THE MALAYSIAN SIDE EXPRESSED ITS APPRECIATION FOR THIS FIRST </p><p>OFFICIAL VISIT BY AN EXPORT CONTROL REGIME TO KUALA LUMPUR, </p><p>AND WAS GRATEFUL TO HEAR ABOUT THE STEPS THAT WERE BEING </p><p>TAKEN BY MTCR PARTNER STATES TO COUNTER PROLIFERATION OF </p><p>MISSILES AN SENSITIVE MISSILE TECHNOLOGY.  FROM ITS SIDE, </p><p>MALAYSIA AT THE MOMENT DID NOT HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE EXPORT </p><p>CONTROL SYSTEM.  CERTAINLY, MALAYSIA WAS POLITICALLY </p><p>COMMITTED TO NON-PROLIFERATION AND TO THE CREATION OF A WORLD </p><p>FREE OF WMD.  BUT PUTTING IN PLACE AND IMPLEMENTING A </p><p>COMPREHENSIVE CONTROL MECHANISM WAS SEEN AS A DIFFICULT TASK. </p><p> MALAYSIA DID NOT HAVE THE CAPABILITIES TO ACHIEVE SUCH A </p><p>GOAL.  THERE WERE LICENSING REQUIREMENTS AND CONTROLS FOR THE </p><p>IMPORT AND EXPORT OF SOME SPECIFIC GOODS AND COMMODITIES, </p><p>INCLUDING ARMS, BUT THE CONCEPT OF DUAL-USE GOODS, AS </p><p>DESCRIBED BY THE MTCR TEAM, WAS NEW AND NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD </p><p>BY MALAYSIA.  HOW COULD ONE ESTABLISH THAT CERTAIN CHEMICALS </p><p>WERE INTENDED FOR USE IN WMD PROGRAMS, AND NOT FOR INSTANCE </p><p>FOR LEGITIMATE FERTILIZER PROGRAMS AND SUCH? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GENERALLY SPEAKING, IT WAS UNDERLINED THAT MALAYSIA WAS </p><p>LARGELY DEPENDENT ON ITS TRADE, AND WAS AFRAID THAT A </p><p>COMPREHENSIVE CONTROL SYSTEM WOULD RUN COUNTER TO ITS </p><p>COMMERCIAL INTERESTS, WHICH WERE MALAYSIA\'S PRINCIPLE SOURCE </p><p>OF INCOME. ITS MAIN PRIORITY WAS TO EXPAND ITS HARBOR </p><p>FACILITIES, WHICH WERE STILL VERY MUCH SMALLER THAN </p><p>SINGAPORE, AND IT FELT THAT TOO MANY CONTROLS WOULD RUN </p><p>COUNTER TO THIS OBJECTIVE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FROM ITS SIDE, THE MTCR TEAM ONCE AGAIN UNDERLINED ITS VIEW </p><p>THAT NON-PROLIFERATION IS A SHARED RESPONSIBILITY OF ALL </p><p>PEACELOVING NATIONS, AND THAT REGIONAL STABILITY AND SECURITY </p><p>ARE NECESSARY PREREQUISITES FOR ESTABLISHING FREE TRADE </p><p>RELATIONS.  IN THAT SENSE, EXPORT CONTROLS DO NOT RUN COUNTER </p><p>TO COMMERCIAL INTERESTS, THEY ARE TWO SIDES OF THE SAME </p><p>MEDALLION. IT WAS UNDERLINED THAT THE DUTCH EXPORT CONTROL </p><p>SYSTEM WAS ONLY ONE WAY TO IMPLEMENT NON-PROLIFERATION </p><p>UNDERTAKINGS, AND THAT EVERY COUNTRY WAS ENTITLED TO </p><p>INCORPORATE A SYSTEM OF CONTROLS IN SCALE WITH ITS OWN </p><p>POSSIBILITIES AND RESOURCES.  AN EXAMPLE OF THIS WAS THE NEW </p><p>ZEALAND SYSTEM, WHICH WORKED VERY WELL FOR THAT COUNTRY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>IN CONCLUSION, THE CHAIR EXPRESSED ITS HOPE THAT IT HAD BEEN </p><p>ABLE TO CONVINCE THE MALAYSIAN AUTHORITIES OF THE URGENT NEED </p><p>TO WORK TOGETHER WITH THE AIM OF COUNTERING THE PROLIFERATION </p><p>OF MISSILES AND MISSILE TECHNOLOGY AND THAT THE VISIT WOULD </p><p>INSPIRE THEM TO LOOK INTO THE IMPROVEMENT OF MALAYSIA\'S </p><p>EXPORT AND TRANSSHIPMENT CONTROLS. THE MTCR WAS READY TO </p><p>PROVIDE THE NECESSARY ASSISTANCE AND INFORMATION TO THIS END, </p><p>AND EXPRESSED THE HOPE THAT A FRAMEWORK COULD BE ESTABLISHED </p><p>FOR FUTURE CONTACTS BETWEEN THE MTCR AND MALAYSIA, ESPECIALLY </p><p>INCLUDING AT THE EXPERT LEVEL.  TO THIS END IT WAS AGREED </p><p>THAT THE MULTILATERAL POLITICAL AFFAIRS DIVISION OF THE MFA </p><p>COULD ACT AS THE POINT OF CONTACT ON THE MALAYSIAN SIDE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>IN GENERAL, THE MTCR TEAM FELT THAT THE MALAYSIAN AUTHORITIES </p><p>WILL NEED A GOOD DEAL OF CONVINCING IN ORDER TO IMPROVE </p><p>MALAYSIAN EXPORT AND TRANSSHIPMENT CONTROLS. IN THEIR HEARTS, </p><p>THEY BELIEVE RIGID CONTROLS ARE NOT COMPATIBLE WITH THEIR </p><p>COMMERCIAL INTERESTS.  HOWEVER, THEY DO NOT SEEM TO BE </p><p>UNWILLING TO LOOK INTO THE MATTER, AND IN THAT REGARD SEEMED </p><p>GENUINELY INTERESTED IN THE AD HOC MECHANISM, AS DESCRIBED IN </p><p>THE OVERVIEW OF THE DUTCH EXPORT CONTROL SYSTEM.  FOLLOW UP </p><p>TO THE MTCR VISIT BY MTCR PARTNERS IS CRUCIAL IN THIS RESPECT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PRELIMINARY CONCLUSIONS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>THE MTCR TEAM CONSIDERS THAT ITS OUTREACH MISSION TO ASIA CAN </p><p>CERTAINLY BE DEEMED TO HAVE FULFILLED ITS PRINCIPLE OBJECTIVE </p><p>OF INFORMING THESE COUNTRIES ABOUT THE MTCR AND ITS </p><p>OBJECTIVES, AND TRYING TO INVOLVE THEM CLOSER IN THE REGIME\'S </p><p>NON-PROLIFERATION EFFORTS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>OF COURSE THIS WAS HARDLY NECESSARY IN THE CASE OF HONG KONG, </p><p>THE FACT THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME AN OFFICIAL MTCR MISSION </p><p>MADE THE EFFORT TO TRAVEL TO THE HONG KONG SAR WAS OBVIOUSLY </p><p>GREATLY APPRECIATED, AND CAN ONLY HELP TO FURTHER STRENGTHEN </p><p>HONG KONG\'S RESOLVE TO UPHOLD AND WHERE POSSIBLE STRENGTHEN </p><p>ITS ALREADY IMPRESSIVE EXPORT AND TRANSSHIPMENT CONTROLS.  AS </p><p>FOR MACAU, THE MTCR TEAM BELIEVES THAT THE MISSION WAS </p><p>CERTAINLY APPRECIATED, AND IT HAS WITHOUT A DOUBT BEEN ABLE </p><p>TO RAISE THE AWARENESS - AND WILLINGNESS - ON THE SIDE OF </p><p>MACAU AUTHORITIES OF THE NEED TO IMPROVE ITS CONTROL SYSTEM. </p><p>THE SINGAPOREAN AUTHORITIES ON THE WHOLE GAVE THE IMPRESSION </p><p>THAT IT WOULD CERTAINLY TAKE SOME EFFORT TO CONVINCE THEM TO </p><p>TAKE THE NECESSARY STEPS TO IMPROVE THEIR CONTROL SYSTEM, </p><p>ESPECIALLY AS REGARDS THE CONTROL OF TRANSSHIPMENT FLOWS </p><p>THROUGH SINGAPORE.  HOWEVER, THE MTCR TEAM BELIEVES THAT IT </p><p>CLEARLY CONVEYED THE MESSAGE THAT THE MTCR WANTS THEM TO </p><p>ESTABLISH AND IMPLEMENT MORE STRINGENT EXPORT AND </p><p>TRANSSHIPMENT CONTROLS.  FINALLY, THE MTCR TEAM BELIEVES THAT </p><p>AS FAR AS MALAYSIA IS CONCERNED, THE MISSION SEEMS TO HAVE </p><p>BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN TAKING AWAY SOME OF THE MISTRUST THAT MAY </p><p>HAVE EXISTED VIS-A-VIS THE MTCR, AND HAS AT LEAST SUCCEEDED </p><p>IN OPENING A CHANNEL FOR FUTURE DIALOGUE WITH THE MALAYSIAN </p><p>AUTHORITIES. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>THE MTCR TEAM BELIEVES THAT ITS VISIT SHOULD BE GIVEN THE </p><p>NECESSARY FOLLOW-UP IN THE (NEAR) FUTURE, ESPECIALLY IN WAY </p><p>OF BILATERAL VISITS AT THE EXPERT LEVEL AND OF INVITING THEM </p><p>TO PARTICIPATE IN FUTURE SEMINARS OR MEETINGS IN THE </p><p>FRAMEWORK OF THE ROUND TABLE MECHANISM. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>END REPORT TEXT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SCHNEIDER </p><p></p></div>
