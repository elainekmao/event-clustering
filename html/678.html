<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 DHAKA 006796 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR SA/PAB; LONDON FOR TUELLER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, BG </p><p>SUBJECT: VIOLENCE ERUPTS DURING HASINA\'S "TRAIN MARCH;" </p><p>          AWAMI LEAGUE ALLEGES ASSASINATION ATTEMPT </p><p> </p><p>REF:  DHAKA 6682 </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY: THE OPPOSITION AWAMI LEAGUE ALLEGES THAT </p><p>ITS LEADER SHEIKH HASINA WAS TARGET OF AN ASSASSINATION </p><p>ATTEMPT SEP 23 DURING A "WHISTLESTOP" RAIL TOUR OF </p><p>WESTERN BANGLADESH.  ALTHOUGH GOVERNMENT AND OPPOSITION </p><p>SUPPORTERS CLASHED, WE HAVE SO FAR SEEN NO EVIDENCE THAT </p><p>AN ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT TOOK PLACE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  CLASHES BETWEEN RULING BANGLADESH NATIONALIST PARTY </p><p>(BNP) AND OPPOSITION AWAMI LEAGUE SUPPORTERS BROKE OUT </p><p>AT THE ISHURDI AND NATORE TRAIN STATIONS IN WESTERN </p><p>BANGLADESH SEPTEMBER 23, COINCIDING WITH STOPS BY AWAMI </p><p>LEAGUE (AL) CHIEF AND LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION SHEIKH </p><p>HASINA.  HASINA HAS BEEN ON A PROLONGED "WHISTLESTOP" </p><p>TOUR--A "TRAIN MARCH"--OF THE REGION TO DRUM UP SUPPORT </p><p>FOR THE OPPOSITION\'S SEPTEMBER 27 RAIL AND HIGHWAY </p><p>BLOCKADE AND ITS DEMAND FOR A CARETAKER GOVERNMENT TO </p><p>OVERSEE THE COUNTRY\'S NEXT GENERAL ELECTION. </p><p> </p><p>4.  ACCORDING TO PRESS REPORTS, BNP PARTISANS ARMED WITH </p><p>BLUNT WEAPONS AND HOMEMADE FIRECRACKERS ATTACKED AL </p><p>SUPPORTERS PROCEEDING TO THE ISHURDI STATION.  POLICE </p><p>OPENED FIRE AT ONE POINT TO BRING THE SITUATION UNDER </p><p>CONTROL.  REPORTS ALSO QUOTED WITNESSES WHO SAID </p><p>HASINA\'S RAIL CAR WAS FIRED UPON AS IT PULLED INTO THE </p><p>NATORE STATION.  FIRECRACKERS WERE TOSSED AS HASINA </p><p>ADDRESSED CROWDS FROM HER COMPARTMENT.  THE CLASHES LEFT </p><p>BETWEEN 60-100 INJURED, NONE CRITICALLY. </p><p> </p><p>5.  AWAMI LEAGUE STALWARTS BLAMED THE VIOLENCE ON THE </p><p>BNP GOVERNMENT.  AWAMI LEAGUE INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS </p><p>SECRETARY KAISER CHOWDHURY CALLED POLOFF SEPTEMBER 23 TO </p><p>SAY THAT "THE LEADER HAS BEEN FIRED UPON."  AL DEPUTY </p><p>LEADER ABDUS SAMAD AZAD TOLD REPORTERS THAT "BNP </p><p>TERRORISTS" HAD LAUNCHED A PLANNED ATTACK AGAINST HASINA </p><p>AND CREATED A "REIGN OF TERROR" AT ISHURDI AND NATORE. </p><p>AWAMI LEAGUE SECRETARY GENERAL ZILLUR RAHMAN DECRIED THE </p><p>"ASSASINATION ATTEMPT," WHICH HE SAID WAS "MASTERMINDED </p><p>BY THE HIGEST QUARTERS OF THE PRESENT ADMINISTRATION." </p><p>HASIA VOWED THAT NO ATTACK WOULD DETER THE MOVEMENT FO </p><p>CARETAKER GOVERNMENT, AND THAT SHE STOOD READY O "GIVE </p><p>MY OWN BLOOD." </p><p> </p><p>6.  THE GOVERNMENT, FO ITS PART, ISSUED A PRESS NOTE </p><p>SEPTEMBER 24 STATNG A PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION HAD </p><p>FOUND NO TRUTHIN THE ALLEGATIN THAT HASINA\'S TRAIN WAS </p><p>SHOT A.  IN REALITY, READ THE NOTE, HASINA ADDRESSED </p><p>COWDS AT WAYSIDE STATIONS IN A PEACEFUL ATMOSPHERE,AND </p><p>SUFFICIENT POLICE WERE MOBILIZED FOR HER SAFETY. </p><p>"UNRULY SUPPORTERS" OF OPPOSING POLITICAL PARTIES WERE </p><p>PRESENT IN NATORE AND ISHURDI, THROWING FIRECRACKERS, </p><p>BUT POLICE RESTORED ORDER QUICKLY.  A FRONT-PAGE </p><p>EDITORIAL IN THE PRO-BNP ENGLISH DAILY "NEW NATION" </p><p>SARCASTICALLY POINTED OUT THAT THIS WAS NOT THE FIRST </p><p>TIME HASINA HAD TRIED TO DRAMATIZE FOR POLITICAL GAIN </p><p>ALLEGED ATTEMPTS ON HER LIFE. </p><p> </p><p>7.  THE AWAMI LEAGUE HAS NOT PRESSED THE GOVERNMENT FOR </p><p>A FOLLOW-UP INVESTIGATION OF THE INCIDENTS AT ISHURDI </p><p>AND NATORE, ALTHOUGH TOP AWAMI LEAGUE ADVISOR KIBRIA </p><p>FAXED THE AMBASSADOR EXPRESSING "DEEP CONCERN ABOUT THE </p><p>ATTACK ON THE LIFE OF SHEIKH HASINA."  ACCORDING TO </p><p>KIBRIA, "THE GRAVE IMPLICATIONS OF THE TERROR CAMPAIGN </p><p>BY THE GOVERNMENT PARTY" WILL BECOME CLEAR WHEN ALL THE </p><p>FACTS ARE OUT.  KIBRIA DID NOT SPECIFY WHEN THIS MIGHT </p><p>HAPPEN. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  WE HAVE LITTLE FACTUAL BASIS TO SORT OUT CONFLICTING </p><p>CLAIMS AND DETERMINE WHETHER HASINA WAS THE TARGET OF AN </p><p>ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT.  (WE WILL REPORT ANY SIGNIFICANT </p><p>NEW INFORMATION.)  HOWEVER, CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE </p><p>SUGGESTS THAT THE CLASHES WERE NOT PART OF A </p><p>PREMEDITATED ATTEMPT ON HER LIFE.  THE MOST BELIEVABLE </p><p>ACCOUNTS WE HAVE HEARD BLAME THE VIOLENCE ON STATE </p><p>MINISTER FAZLUR RAHMAN, WHO HAILS FROM NEAR NATORE AND </p><p>WHOSE OWN BNP RALLY THERE WAS DISRUPTED BY OPPOSITION </p><p>AWAMI LEAGUE SUPPORTERS A FEW WEEKS EARLIER.  RAHMAN </p><p>ALLEGEDLY HELD A GRUDGE AND SENT OUT SOME OF HIS "BOYS" </p><p>TO BREAK UP HASINA\'S RALLY.  OTHER REPORTS SUGGEST THE </p><p>AWAMI LEAGUE KNEW IT WOULD FACE BNP DEMONSTRATIONS IN </p><p>THE REGION BEFORE THE TRAIN SET OUT THE MORNING OF THE </p><p>23RD.  IN ADDITION, ALL ACCOUNTS AGREE THAT HASINA </p><p>COMPLETED HER SPEECHES AT ISHURDI AND NATORE AND DID NOT </p><p>FLEE OR SEEK COVER DESPITE THE ALLEGED SHOTS AT HER </p><p>TRAIN.  WHAT IS CERTAIN IS THAT THE AWAMI LEAGUE HAS </p><p>SOUGHT TO WHIP UP POPULAR INDIGNATION OVER THE INCIDENTS </p><p>AND WILL UNDOUBTEDLY CONTINUE ITS PUBLIC DENUNCIATIONS </p><p>OF GOVERNMENT "TERRORISM." </p><p> </p><p>MERRILL </p><p></p></div>
