MILLARD; </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  09-09-12 </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PGOV, EAIR, ASEC, CASC, MV, IN, SE </p><p>SUBJECT:  Crew foils attempt to hijack Air Seychelles </p><p>flight; Alleged perpetrator in Maldivian custody </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  (A) Colombo-SA/INS 09-09-02 fax </p><p>-      (B) Ops Center-Colombo 09-09-02 telecons </p><p>-      (C) FBIS Reston Va DTG 090617Z Sep 02 </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by W. Lewis Amselem, Charge d\'Affaires. </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b, d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary:  Maldivian authorities have confirmed </p><p>that there was an attempted hijacking of an Air </p><p>Seychelles airliner on September 9.  The crew subdued a </p><p>passenger armed with a knife who tried to enter the </p><p>cockpit.  One member of the crew was injured in the </p><p>incident.  The flight landed safely in the Maldives, </p><p>where the alleged perpetrator has been detained.  The </p><p>Maldivian investigation into the incident continues. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Maldivian authorities have confirmed that </p><p>there was an attempted hijacking of an Air Seychelles </p><p>airliner earlier today (September 9).  According to </p><p>preliminary information gathered from sources in the </p><p>Maldivian government, a passenger aboard an Air </p><p>Seychelles flight (HM01017 from Mumbai to the Seychelles </p><p>via the Maldives) attempted to enter the plane\'s cockpit </p><p>at around 0500 hrs local time (+4 GMT) this morning, but </p><p>was subdued by crew members.  The man was armed with a </p><p>knife and indicated that he wanted to divert the </p><p>aircraft.  One member of the crew was slightly injured </p><p>during the incident.  After the plane landed safely in </p><p>the Maldives, the alleged perpetrator was immediately </p><p>placed in the custody of the Maldivian National Security </p><p>Service.  (Note:  Also see Colombo DAO IIR Septel for </p><p>additional information.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) (((Note:  Ref C AFP report asserts that the </p><p>incident involved two attempted hijackers, which </p><p>contradicts the information we have received from </p><p>Maldivian contacts.  The report adds that the Air </p><p>Seychelles flight had 200 passengers on board.))) </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Maldivian authorities have told us that they </p><p>continue to investigate the incident and will pass </p><p>whatever information they turn up to us.  They report </p><p>that one AmCit was on board the flight and was unharmed. </p><p>There is no information indicating a possible political </p><p>motivation to the attempted hijacking available at this </p><p>time.  The nationality of the alleged perpetrator is not </p><p>clear.  He was apparently carrying an Indian passport, </p><p>but Maldivian authorities have told us that the passport </p><p>was apparently a forgery.  (Note:  The Indian passport, </p><p>number S790172, identified the alleged perpetrator as </p><p>Chandra Babu Sasi; DoB 20-08-1970.)  Maldivian </p><p>authorities have said to us that the man looks as if he </p><p>could be an "Indian or Bangladeshi," but they are not </p><p>sure. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Comment:  As far as we are aware, this is the </p><p>first attempted hijacking involving the Maldives in any </p><p>way.  At this point, there is no indication that the </p><p>incident involves an Islamic extremist aspect, but it is </p><p>still too early to say for sure.  The Maldivian </p><p>government has been a solid member of the international </p><p>coalition against terrorism and we expect that it will </p><p>brief us thoroughly as it continues to investigate the </p><p>incident.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>AMSELEM </p><p></p></div>
