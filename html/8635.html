Despite </p><p>a vocal minority of "old economy" businessmen who grilled </p><p>U.S. speakers about compensation claims and complained that </p><p>"Jordan\'s share" of reconstruction contracts wasn\'t doled out </p><p>at the conference, a solid majority of business </p><p>representatives, including delegations from a dozen countries </p><p>from East Asia to Eastern Europe, used the conference to gain </p><p>information about new business realities in Iraq and to </p><p>network with contractors and attending Iraqi businessmen. </p><p>The conference highlighted the widening gap between a fading </p><p>breed of old economy traders and a new breed of professionals </p><p>in Jordan and the region who are positioning themselves to </p><p>capitalize on free-market opportunities in Iraq.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>CONFERENCE DRAWS GLOBAL INTEREST </p><p> </p><p>2.  (u)  Attendance at the day-long June 5 "Doing Business </p><p>With Iraq" conference surpassed the most optimistic </p><p>predictions of the conference\'s organizers.  Over 1,200 </p><p>people attended, including business delegations from Turkey, </p><p>Japan, India, Bulgaria, and throughout the Gulf, among </p><p>others.  Also in attendance were key Iraqi business figures </p><p>in Jordan, and self-styled representatives of Iraqi chambers </p><p>of industry and commerce.  The conference featured speakers </p><p>from major humanitarian assistance organizations, primary </p><p>contractors for the reconstruction process (including </p><p>Bechtel, ABT, and Creative Associates), and representatives </p><p>from the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA).  Trade </p><p>Minister Bashir opened the conference, and the Ambassador </p><p>spoke at the conference lunch event. </p><p> </p><p>KEY MESSAGES </p><p> </p><p>3.  (u)  Following a background briefing by McKinsey and Co. </p><p>highlighting Iraq\'s projected reconstruction needs (roughly </p><p>$500 billion to regain 1980 levels; a similar figure to </p><p>modernize), conference participants heard three main messages </p><p>repeated by virtually all the speakers throughout the day\'s </p><p>events.  First, speakers emphasized that reconstruction </p><p>contracts represented a tiny fraction of Iraq\'s long-term </p><p>rebuilding and commercial needs, and noted further that </p><p>competition for sub-contracts under existing awards was </p><p>fierce.  Bechtel repeated a theme from presentations </p><p>elsewhere that strong interest from globally competitive </p><p>companies was already well in evidence - over 8,000 </p><p>applications had been submitted through the Bechtel website </p><p>for reconstruction subcontracting.  Bechtel said companies </p><p>should be realistic about their expectations of winning </p><p>subcontracts, highlighting the competitive nature of the </p><p>bidding process. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (u)  Second, speakers repeated the refrain "go to </p><p>Baghdad," noting that the bulk of economic activity in Iraq </p><p>would be done on the ground, in the private sector, by </p><p>companies with initiative that were willing to take risks. </p><p>They acknowledged that there still existed in Iraq </p><p>significant risk factors, both on the security side and on </p><p>the legal/investment protection side, but noted that many </p><p>companies are already trading with Iraqi importers, some are </p><p>setting up offices, and others are actively seeking Iraqi </p><p>investment partners.  This message contrasted sharply with </p><p>what local businessmen said they had been hearing on the </p><p>street and unofficially from returnees from Baghdad, who had </p><p>(prior to June 5) discouraged travel into Iraq on security </p><p>grounds. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (u)  Third, speakers from the CPA acknowledged that the </p><p>disposition of outstanding contracts with the Saddam Hussein </p><p>regime were a thorny issue.  They stressed, though, that it </p><p>was too early to be able to answer specific questions about </p><p>specific contracts, especially since the UNSC had not yet </p><p>made a final determination regarding how uncompleted </p><p>contracts would be treated, or indeed whether or not pending </p><p>contracts could be executed.  Regarding outstanding contracts </p><p>under other mechanisms (i.e., the bilateral Jordan-Iraq </p><p>protocol and commercial contracts with formerly state-owned </p><p>enterprises), Trade Minister Bashir told the conference </p><p>settlement of claims would have to await the standing up of </p><p>an Iraqi counterpart ministry with which to discuss the issue. </p><p> </p><p>VOCAL MINORITY VENTS OVER CONTRACTS </p><p> </p><p>6.  (u)  An angry knot of several dozen Jordanian businessmen </p><p>grilled speakers from CPA, Bechtel, and McKinsey about </p><p>outstanding contracts.  One businessman used a Q&A session </p><p>following the initial presentation to accuse the U.S. of </p><p>"wanting to invest in war, but not in peace," an assertion </p><p>that met with some applause.  Primarily, this group of local </p><p>businessmen used the Q&A session to ask a dozen varieties of </p><p>the same question:  "how will I be compensated for my </p><p>specific outstanding contract?"  Speakers repeated the </p><p>message above regarding the complexity of the situation, an </p><p>unpopular response among those who had been trading with the </p><p>Saddam regime in the months leading up to war. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (sbu)  Following the conference, a number of like-minded </p><p>local businessmen complained that the meeting had been </p><p>mis-advertised.  Rather than the subcontracts for </p><p>reconstruction they expected to be handed to them on a silver </p><p>platter at the conference, these businessmen were confronted </p><p>with the reality that subcontracts would be competed </p><p>transparently and on the basis of quality and initiative from </p><p>competing firms.  Some 200 attendees left the conference </p><p>early, bringing local media with them to vent further about </p><p>how little they got out of the conference. </p><p> </p><p>SILENT MAJORITY NETWORKS, LEARNS, EARNS </p><p> </p><p>8.  (u)  Those who stayed, however, had significant and often </p><p>rewarding opportunities to network with third-country </p><p>investors looking for partners, with Iraqi businessmen </p><p>looking for partners/suppliers, and with contractors.  Many </p><p>local participants commented at the end of the conference </p><p>that they had done more business that day than in the </p><p>previous month.  Contractors and CPA officials also held </p><p>break-out sessions with small groups of interested </p><p>businesses, and Bechtel and CPA officials held an additional </p><p>five hours of one-on-one sessions with individual businessmen </p><p>throughout the conference day.  Key Iraqi business leaders in </p><p>Amman took over one of the break-out rooms early in the day </p><p>and could be seen "holding court" with interested parties </p><p>both from Jordan and from third country delegations. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (sbu)  Representatives from primary contractors were </p><p>impressed at the professionalism and capabilities of the </p><p>Jordanian companies with which they met.  Both the Bechtel </p><p>and the ABT reps noted that they had developed solid leads </p><p>for suppliers as a result of the conference. </p><p> </p><p>KEY JORDANIANS RECEIVE PERSONAL MESSAGE </p><p> </p><p>10.  (sbu)  Following the conference, the Ambassador held an </p><p>informal round table for key Jordanian business leaders with </p><p>CPA officials and primary contractors.  The business leaders </p><p>appreciated CPA\'s views on the on-the-ground realities in </p><p>Baghdad, and came away reassured that the USG is focused on </p><p>what the key short- and long-term issues are for Iraq, and </p><p>that the CPA had a plan to address those issues </p><p>systematically.  Business leaders stressed that the single </p><p>most critical piece of infrastructure holding back commerce </p><p>in Iraq was the re-establishment of financial institutions </p><p>and a banking sector.  Following closely behind as a key need </p><p>was the establishment of civil courts to provide a measure of </p><p>protection for investors. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (sbu)  Some business leaders noted that ultimately, </p><p>those who were sincere about taking advantage of </p><p>opportunities would just have to jump in with both feet, </p><p>accepting the inherent security and financial risk in </p><p>exchange for potentially significant rewards.  At the same </p><p>time, some business leaders observed that financial risks for </p><p>Jordanian companies were, on the whole, relatively higher </p><p>than for businesses in, for example, Kuwait - mostly because </p><p>of greater availability of venture/risk capital in the Gulf. </p><p>Business leaders said they would welcome the establishment of </p><p>some sort of umbrella arrangement by the CPA to provide some </p><p>measure of investor protection. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (sbu)  Ultimately, many business leaders agreed that the </p><p>optimal business plan for now would be to partner with a </p><p>knowledgeable Iraqi counterpart, both to spread the risk and </p><p>to take advantage of the local market expertise of Iraqi </p><p>partners.  An Embassy contact at the palace told us </p><p>separately that his family was already renewing dormant </p><p>relationships with Iraqi importers and investment partners to </p><p>restart businesses that had been thriving prior to the onset </p><p>of UNSC sanctions. </p><p> </p><p>ASSESSING THE CONCERNS </p><p> </p><p>13.  (sbu)  This conference highlighted the thirst for any </p><p>information about Iraq, both in Jordan and in the surrounding </p><p>region.  It also showed the deepening frustration many </p><p>companies are feeling over the inability to get an answer </p><p>regarding compensation claims for outstanding contracts - </p><p>both under the OFF program and through other trade </p><p>arrangements.  We believe a decision on handling of </p><p>outstanding OFF contracts, and rapid placement of COTECNA </p><p>inspectors at border points to stamp documents would go a </p><p>long way toward dispelling much of the frustration and anger </p><p>in local business communities over contracts they feel they </p><p>entered into in good faith with the UN. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (sbu)  On a similar note, the conference also </p><p>highlighted changing realities on the local business scene. </p><p>It is becoming increasingly apparent, even to old economy </p><p>stalwarts, that the "old ways" of doing business through </p><p>guaranteed carve-outs in protected markets for </p><p>non-competitive goods and services are rapidly falling by the </p><p>wayside.  One telling example:  Kellogg Brown and Root (KBR) </p><p>recently tendered the construction of a bypass road to </p><p>facilitate the rebuilding of a bridge in an Iraqi town.  A </p><p>Jordanian consultant assessed the project at $300,000.  Three </p><p>Jordanian bidders then colluded on their bids, putting in </p><p>offers starting at $1.2 million for the project.  KBR was </p><p>forced to reject all three bids, giving the project instead </p><p>to an Iraqi firm for around $300,000.  This sort of </p><p>self-destructive behavior is typical of old economy Jordanian </p><p>companies, and it is the sort of behavior that will </p><p>ultimately push them out of the reconstruction effort unless </p><p>they change their ways.  The meteor of open competition has </p><p>struck the Jordanian business world, and those dinosaurs that </p><p>cannot adapt will ultimately fade away. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
