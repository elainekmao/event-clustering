(U) Estarta Solutions, the result of a merger between two </p><p>prominent and well-established Jordanian IT companies, </p><p>represents a significant expansion of Microsoft\'s investment </p><p>and presence in Jordan.  The new company bills itself as an </p><p>international IT solutions company and consultant </p><p>specializing in e-government, e-education, banking and </p><p>finance, telecom, and logistics.  The deal demonstrates the </p><p>GOJ\'s determination to boost the development of the IT </p><p>sector.  End Summary </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>BACKGROUND </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) On May 20, following weeks of speculation and </p><p>negotiations, and amidst a great deal of fanfare, Microsoft </p><p>Vice President for Europe, the Middle East, and Africa Emre </p><p>Birkin announced the launch of Estarta Solutions, the result </p><p>of a merger between Jordan\'s two leading IT firms, ONEWORLD </p><p>Jordan and Zeine Technological Applications.  Birkin said </p><p>that reform of Jordan\'s investment framework laws and a </p><p>favorable "IT investment ambiance" in the country were behind </p><p>Microsoft\'s preference to launch a new project in Jordan. </p><p>The new firm, which will be based in Amman, will employ 200 </p><p>people.  Among its current clients are Thomson Financial, </p><p>Apple, Siemens, and the Jordanian government. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) Microsoft will take a small share in the company, as </p><p>will al-Foursan, a local venture capital fund specializing in </p><p>IT companies.  In addition to its investment stake, Microsoft </p><p>has committed to channel business to Estarta (such as for </p><p>creating an Arabic version of its Excel 7.0 spreadsheet </p><p>program).  According to a banker involved as an adviser in </p><p>the merger negotiations, some issues relating to the </p><p>corporate structure and management of the new company remain </p><p>to be worked out. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>THE HOPE OF JORDAN </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) At a dinner reception given by Estarta to celebrate </p><p>the launch and attended by the Ambassador, Minister of </p><p>Planning Bassem Awadallah, Minister of Trade, Industry and </p><p>Commerce Salah al-Bashir, and local IT professionals, </p><p>Minister of Information and Communications Technology Fawwaz </p><p>Zu\'bi opened the proceedings and said the "young </p><p>entrepreneurs" who forged the new company represented "the </p><p>hope of Jordan".  He said the merged company represented a </p><p>model for "what we would like to see in Jordan", and </p><p>expressed his hope that other international IT companies </p><p>might now be more encouraged to invest in Jordan as a result </p><p>of the deal.  The Ambassador cited Microsoft\'s participation </p><p>in the venture as "a vote of confidence in Jordan\'s ability </p><p>to grow". </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) Earlier, at a press conference announcing the merger, </p><p>King Abdullah stressed the importance of cooperation between </p><p>the private sector and the government, particularly the </p><p>Ministry of Information and Communications Technology, in </p><p>working "to open new horizons for IT in Jordan".  Contacts </p><p>between Microsoft and Jordan developed following a meeting </p><p>between King Abdullah and Microsoft CEO Bill Gates at the </p><p>World Economic Forum in Davos in 2000.  Their relationship </p><p>drove Microsoft\'s plans for expanding its presence in Jordan. </p><p> One reason for the long gestation period was the change in </p><p>Jordan\'s Companies Law required to permit the formation of a </p><p>joint stock company (as opposed to the more common form of a </p><p>limited liability partnership), as demanded by Microsoft. </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>SYNERGIES </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) We spoke with Estarta Senior Director Basil Qubain </p><p>about some of the upcoming projects the new company had in </p><p>the pipeline.  He stressed that Estarta was all about </p><p>creating new approaches and synergies for its clients, not </p><p>using existing applications to solve problems.  He cited </p><p>Mobius, a wireless platform that enables content providers to </p><p>send web-based content to any mobile phone, and Gaia, </p><p>Estarta\'s patent-pending pattern recognition software, as two </p><p>major projects with broad applications, ranging from </p><p>commercial to military, forged as solutions to client </p><p>problems and challenges.  As an example of Estarta\'s </p><p>cooperation with Microsoft, Qubain pointed to Muse, an </p><p>automated intelligence interface that plugs into Microsoft </p><p>programs and acts as a virtual information manager and </p><p>organizer.  By way of example, Qubain explained that once an </p><p>email is received by a user, Muse will list all previously </p><p>received emails linked either by subject or sender, enabling </p><p>the user to access and consolidate related information. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) Qubain said that the merger itself has gone quite </p><p>smoothly, as clients and personnel from Zeine and ONEWORLD </p><p>complement each other rather well.  He added Estarta did face </p><p>a challenge regarding rival mobile telecom companies Fastlink </p><p>and MobileCom, as each was a client of Zeine and ONEWORLD </p><p>respectively.  While theoretically it was possible to retain </p><p>both firms as clients, he said given current tensions between </p><p>the two it was impractical and unlikely.  Qubain said he did </p><p>not yet know how the dilemma would be resolved. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) Coming after a dry period following the September 11 </p><p>disaster, Microsoft\'s decision to invest in Jordan represents </p><p>a shot in the arm for Jordan\'s efforts to attract foreign </p><p>investment despite its volatile neighborhood.  It is also a </p><p>boost for the Jordanian IT sector.  Not just another IT shop, </p><p>Estarta has the goods and the drive to become, as it hopes, </p><p>the leading IT solution provider in the region with worldwide </p><p>reach.  The success of Microsoft\'s investment in Estarta </p><p>could well attract more likewise innovative firms and </p><p>investors to a sector that Jordan expects to be a key to its </p><p>continued economic growth. </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
