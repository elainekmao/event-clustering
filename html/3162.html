<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 001811 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT PASS TO USTR FOR WHITAKER AND COLEMAN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/17/2012 </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, EINV, ECON, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: POST PERSPECTIVE ON JUNE 24 TIFA COUNCIL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA 1606 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Classified by CDA Andrews for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The Nigerian delegation to the June 24 Trade and </p><p>Investment Framework Agreement Council in Washington will be </p><p>headed by Minister of Commerce Engineer Mustafa Bello.  The </p><p>annual Council meeting provides an opportunity for senior </p><p>level policy discussion and for both sides to take stock of </p><p>major issues on the bilateral trade and investment agenda. </p><p>However, GON preparedness may not be what we would hope. </p><p>They may not yet have in mind specific goals or a plan of </p><p>action they would like to see come from the meeting.  To make </p><p>the meeting as productive as possible, we should develop an </p><p>agenda that includes general policy discussion as well as </p><p>concrete steps that can be taken by both sides to advance </p><p>bilateral trade and investment.  We should maintain a careful </p><p>balance between the issues we push on and what we can do to </p><p>help them. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) We suggest that the U.S. delegation take this </p><p>opportunity to encourage GON economic reform, especially </p><p>tariff reduction and rationalization and exchange rate and </p><p>monetary policies.  We should thank the GON for their support </p><p>of U.S. positions at multilateral fora including the Doha WTO </p><p>meeting, and enlist their continued assistance on these and </p><p>other issues such as those which may arise at the World </p><p>Summit on Sustainable Development coming up in August in </p><p>South Africa.  We should push for movement on a number of </p><p>outstanding issues including ratification of the OPIC and </p><p>Open Skies agreements. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Nigeria will not enact appropriate legislation for </p><p>AGOA eligibility prior to this TIFA Council.  We should use </p><p>this meeting to reach final agreement on regulatory language </p><p>for the AGOA visa regime, and encourage the GON to resolve </p><p>the legislative roadblock on transshipment penalties that has </p><p>kept Nigeria from enjoying full AGOA benefits.  We should </p><p>discuss agricultural and textile opportunities.  While giving </p><p>the GON recognition for progress made in instituting due </p><p>process for capital projects, we should encourage the GON to </p><p>exercise fiscal restraint and enter in a program with the IMF </p><p>at the earliest opportunity.  We also should encourage </p><p>greater transparency in government contracting, including the </p><p>petroleum sector. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) Below is the text of the Objectives of the Second TIFA </p><p>Council meeting submitted by the Nigerian Ministry of </p><p>Commerce.  This is the only documentation we have received </p><p>from the GON regarding the TIFA meeting. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BEGIN TEXT: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It is pertinent to recall that the overall objective of the </p><p>TIFA is to develop further for both countries the </p><p>international trade and economic interrelationship.  This </p><p>objective is to be achieved through: </p><p>(1)   Fostering an open and predictable environment for </p><p>international trade and investment; </p><p>(2)   Mutual resolution of trade and investment problem </p><p>between the two countries; </p><p>(3)   Removal of trade and investment barriers between our </p><p>two countries; </p><p>(4)   Increased participation of both countries private </p><p>economic operators in foreign direct investment; </p><p>(5)   Elimination of non-tariff barriers in order to </p><p>facilitate great access to markets of both countries; </p><p>(6)   Providing adequate and effective protection and </p><p>enforcement of intellectual property rights etc; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The TIFA Council is essentially put in place to ensure full </p><p>implementation of these objectives and the inaugural Session </p><p>at Abuja addressed some of these issues.  The focus of </p><p>Washington meeting therefore, should be to: </p><p>(1)   Review the issues discussed at the inaugural Council </p><p>and perhaps assess the extent of implementation; </p><p>(2)   Discuss issues still constituting impediments to </p><p>unfettered and fair trade between our two countries and </p><p>proffer solutions to them; </p><p>(3)   Discuss new strategies to increase US-Nigeria trade and </p><p>investment flows; </p><p>(4)   Apprise the Council of Nigerian efforts at implementing </p><p>AGOA; </p><p>(5)   Explore new areas of technical assistance in developing </p><p>agriculture and empowerment of Nigerian women; </p><p>(6)   Cooperate in areas such as agriculture and </p><p>Biotechnology and irrigation projects; </p><p>(7)   Seek further grant assistance from the US Trade </p><p>Development Agency (TDA) and increased involvement of </p><p>Overseas Private Sector Investment Corporation (OPIC) in </p><p>Nigeria; </p><p>(8)   Further identify the funds which OPIC is making </p><p>available to Africa, so as to enable Nigeria to take </p><p>advantage of it </p><p>(9)   Create a forum for bilateral trade and investment </p><p>discussions between the two countries business entrepreneurs </p><p>that will be on the delegation; </p><p>(10)  Match potential Nigerian business partners with </p><p>American investors through the US "Strategic Alliance </p><p>programme"; </p><p>(11)  Seek Technical assistance in Bilateral and Multilateral </p><p>Trade Negotiations </p><p>(12)  Apprise the Council of Nigerian Government of efforts </p><p>at facilitating Trade etc. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It is hoped the above will meet the request of the U.S. </p><p>Government in firming up arrangements for the 2nd TIFA </p><p>meeting. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>END TEXT. </p><p>6. (U)  The Nigerian Delegation is: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(1)   Engr. Mustafa Bello, Honorable Minister of the Federal </p><p>Ministry of Commerce and Leader of the Delegation; </p><p>(2)    Mr. E.I. Ogbile, Director of External Trade Department </p><p>of the Federal Ministry of Commerce; </p><p>(3)    Alhaji Dogara Shehu, Special Assistant to the </p><p>Honorable Minister of Commerce; </p><p>(4)   Mr. Y.F. Agah, Federal Ministry of Commerce; </p><p>(5)   Mr. Y.S. Labaran, Federal Ministry of Commerce; </p><p>(6)   Mr. David I. Adulugba, Nigerian Export Promotion </p><p>Council; </p><p>(7)   Dr. Julius Bala, Nigerian Investment Promotion </p><p>Commission; </p><p>(8)   Mr. A.I. Sole, Federal Ministry of Industries; </p><p>(9)   Mr. V.O.E. Adeoba, Federal Ministry of Finance </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. The Ministry of Commerce still wants private sector </p><p>participation but they have not yet communicated to the </p><p>Mission the members of this group. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>Post-suggested Specific Action Items </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) General Policy Reform </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-     The Importance of Fiscal Discipline </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The USG should stress the negative effect of excessive </p><p>government spending on interest rates, inflation, private </p><p>investment, and long-term growth. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-     Importance of Re-establishing a Program with the IMF </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The USG should emphasize the benefits to Nigeria of resuming </p><p>a formal program with the IMF.  Particularly useful is to </p><p>describe the difficulties in debt rescheduling or reduction </p><p>while Nigeria is not part of a program. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-     Exchange Rate Unification </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Again, we should stress the costs to their economy of </p><p>maintaining the parallel exchange rate system.  If numbers </p><p>can be generated to represent the cost to the Nigerian </p><p>economy of "round tripping," it would focus political </p><p>attention on an issue that is usually ignored, or considered </p><p>a perquisite for those officials Nigerians traveling with </p><p>dollars purchased at the IFEM rate. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-     Transparency in Granting of Government Contracts </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The USG can use the information from Reftel on due process in </p><p>capital projects to emphasize the positive benefit of </p><p>reducing corruption.  However, U.S. firms are getting the </p><p>cold shoulder on a number of projects in a less than </p><p>transparent process with NNPC contracts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) AGOA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-     Regulation for Apparel and Textile Visas </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>We should be ready to reach agreement on a final draft from </p><p>the GON at the meeting. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-     Legislation for Transshipment Penalties </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>We should ask that the Nigerian government put pressure on </p><p>the National Assembly to pass legislation increasing </p><p>penalties for transshipment immediately.  This may require </p><p>separating the current language from the Customs Excise </p><p>Management Act (CEMA) where it has been attached. </p><p>-     Identification and Promotion of Niche Market </p><p> Products </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Council should review progress on identified products </p><p>(gum arabic, ginger, prawns) and efforts to identify new </p><p>ones. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-     Export Shipment Alternatives Pending Reform of Ports </p><p>- </p><p>The GON should look at the window of opportunity for direct </p><p>foreign investment in AGOA apparel and textiles. Can the </p><p>industry wait for port reform and rehabilitation?  Discuss </p><p>alternatives such as special Export Processing Zones (EPZ) or </p><p>shipment through neighboring ports. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-     Leather and Footwear </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>What is the potential for this industry and how should the </p><p>GON attract investment? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) Follow Up on US-Nigerian Agreements </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-     Open Skies </p><p>-     OPIC </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) USG Assistance for Capacity Building in Trade and </p><p>Investment </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-     USAID-sponsored Capacity Building Programs </p><p>-     Other Initiatives </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (SBU) Cash Calls and Any Other Outstanding Oil-sector </p><p>Issues </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (SBU) Recognition of Nigerian Economic Accomplishments </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-     Successful privatization process </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Though the NITEL bidders were unable to complete their </p><p>purchase when the world telecom market crumbled, the GON has </p><p>maintained its commitment to privatization.  Each </p><p>privatization has faced political opposition, and the GON </p><p>should be commended for keeping with the program despite </p><p>considerable pressure to keep many items off the auction </p><p>block. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-     Restructuring of Telecom Sector and GSM Success </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GSM telephones more than doubled Nigeria\'s telephone capacity </p><p>in less than six months.  The work of the NCC has made </p><p>possible the near-term renovation of the sector and created </p><p>the largest market for direct investment outside the oil </p><p>sector. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-     Partial Deregulation of the Downstream Oil Sector </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Note the success of the partial deregulation of the </p><p>downstream oil sector in increasing supplies of gasoline </p><p>throughout the country and how that availability is an </p><p>important democracy dividend. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ANDREWS </p><p></p></div>
