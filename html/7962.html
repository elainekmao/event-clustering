The situation in the Kurdish-controlled region of northern </p><p>Iraq remains calm.  The security level above the former "green </p><p>line" has been declared permissive.  CMOC has declared Kirkuk to </p><p>be permissive and Mosul to be semi-permissive during daylight </p><p>hours.  Confusion as to which political body has the lead </p><p>coordination role in Kirkuk and Mosul remains an issue.   A </p><p>UNOHCI representative explained that Mosul and Kirkuk would still </p><p>be treated separately from northern Iraq activities under U.N. </p><p>Security Resolution (UNSCR) 986.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>MINE ACTION MEETING </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  The DART Field Team North attended a mine action meeting on </p><p>30 April.  Hosted by the Civil Military Operations Center (CMOC), </p><p>the meeting was also attended by the U.N. Office for Project </p><p>Services (UNOPS), Mine Action Group, Norwegian Peoples Aid, the </p><p>Ministry of Humanitarian Aid and Cooperation, and several local </p><p>non-governmental organizations (NGOs) involved in mine clearing </p><p>and mine awareness programs. </p><p> </p><p>3.  The agenda included an overview of the proposed mine action </p><p>center structure for all of Iraq, data reporting and sharing, </p><p>standardization issues (prioritization criteria, mapping, and </p><p>marking), the need for a single coordinating authority in </p><p>northern Iraq, survey requirements, operating areas, and support </p><p>requirements. </p><p> </p><p>4.  CMOC is the coordination point for mine action in Arbil. </p><p>CMOC informed those present that the program will be inclusive </p><p>and national, and that there are people in Baghdad working to </p><p>build a national program and a central repository for data and </p><p>information sharing.  While each agency involved in mine action </p><p>seemed to have its own operating procedures, all agreed that </p><p>there is a need to standardize and coordinate all mine-action </p><p>activities.  During the meeting, CMOC announced that any agency </p><p>involved in mine or unexploded ordnance (UXO) demolition must </p><p>provide 24-hour notice before undertaking such activities. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>UNHCR FOOD DISTRIBUTION </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  The DART visited a U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees </p><p>(UNHCR) food distribution point for 2,000 Iranian refugees and </p><p>asylum seekers in Arbil on 2 May.  Upon request from UNHCR, </p><p>Coalition forces provided 42,000 Humanitarian Daily Rations, </p><p>enough to feed the refugees and asylum seekers for 21 days. </p><p>UNHCR expects refugees to consume more than one per day and </p><p>estimates the distributed food to last approximately 14 days. </p><p>UNHCR rationalized its request to the Coalitionary by explaining </p><p>that the WFP public distribution system (PDS) only provided </p><p>support to the refugees for 20 days a month.  Due to the war, </p><p>refugees were not able to work and thus had no income for </p><p>supplemental food.  This food will supplement WFP distributions </p><p>for the next two months. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>MINISTRY OF RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT (MORAD) </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>6.  The DART also met with the Kurdistan Regional Government </p><p>(KRG) MORAD Minister, Deputy Minister, and heads of Planning, </p><p>Rural Development, and Reconstruction and Development Offices on </p><p>1 May.  Established in 1993, MORAD is charged with reconstructing </p><p>those villages destroyed by the former Iraqi regime in the 1980s </p><p>and early 1990s.  MORAD\'s approach is an integrated one, focusing </p><p>on shelter, education, health services, electricity, water and </p><p>sanitation, and income generation.  MORAD coordinates with the </p><p>relevant ministries in the KRG. </p><p> </p><p>7.  The Minister estimated that the former regime destroyed 4,500 </p><p>of the 5,000 villages in the north.  To date, the Ministry has </p><p>reconstructed over 3,000 of these villages, and those remaining </p><p>are in border areas (bordering Iran and Turkey) or are mined and </p><p>have not been considered safe for reconstruction.  A major focus </p><p>for the Ministry is to promote rural development and sustainable </p><p>reintegration for those families who wish to return to their home </p><p>in those villages.  The Minister also noted that often these </p><p>families could earn greater income in their home villages than in </p><p>the cities from which they are returning. </p><p> </p><p>8.  A priority of the Ministry has been to rebuild shelter and </p><p>provide services to 313 families who have returned to 37 villages </p><p>in the "newly liberated areas" of Arbil Governorate.  While much </p><p>of the funding for previous reconstruction came from the U.N. </p><p>under UNSCR 986, the Ministry has none of the necessary funds or </p><p>materials to undertake this new project.  The Ministry is </p><p>planning to conduct a pledge session with various NGOs and U.N. </p><p>agencies to see who may be able to provide financial or material </p><p>resources to rebuild these villages.  The total estimated budget </p><p>is approximately USD 2.4 million. </p><p> </p><p>(Comment: The Ministry seems dedicated to its mandate and is very </p><p>organized.  They shared the same skepticism other ministries have </p><p>articulated about the U.N.; however, the Minister appears </p><p>somewhat sympathetic to the difficult position of the U.N. in pre- </p><p>war Iraq.  The Minister is also concerned about continuation of </p><p>reconstruction projects in a post-986 world.  In a previous </p><p>meeting, UNOPS mentioned that the both KDP and PUK ministries </p><p>allocated UN-HABITAT houses in urban settings meant for </p><p>internally displaced persons (IDPs) to KDP civil servants.  This </p><p>may be a reason behind the Ministry\'s interest in returning IDPs </p><p>to their original villages.  Also, while the Minister stressed </p><p>that all these returns were voluntary, UNOPS-IDP suggested this </p><p>might not always be the case.  End comment.) </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>AGRICULTURE AND IRRIGATION MINISTER </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>9.  The DART met in Arbil on 1 May with Ministry of Agriculture </p><p>and Irrigation Directors General from Duhok and Arbil </p><p>governorates.  Agriculture officials from As Sulaymaniyah also </p><p>attended the meeting.  Ministry officials noted that one of their </p><p>priorities was to develop a wheat market for last year\'s crop and </p><p>another was to develop a market for their upcoming harvest in </p><p>June.  They provided wheat harvest estimates of around 600,000 </p><p>metric tons (MT) in Arbil and Duhok, and 250,000 MT in As </p><p>Sulaymaniyah.  The officials also provided details on silo, </p><p>warehouse, and milling capacities in the three governorates.  A </p><p>big question has been how to purchase large quantities of wheat </p><p>from many small farmers.  Officials noted that this could be </p><p>accomplished by working through the Ministry of Agriculture and </p><p>Irrigation.  The Ministry could disseminate information to </p><p>farmers on quantities needed, grade and purchase amounts from </p><p>farmer or groups of farmers, and store the wheat in silos and </p><p>warehouses.  There are no local farmers\' cooperatives in Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>10.  The DART will discuss further with WFP the possibility of </p><p>assessing the potential harvest (in conjunction with FAO) and </p><p>purchasing a portion of this to meet needs in other areas of the </p><p>country.  Discussion with officials also touched on a number of </p><p>additional food security and water issues, including secondary </p><p>crops, fisheries, and small and large livestock health needs. </p><p>Ministry officials agreed to provide more detailed information to </p><p>the DART. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>IO/NGO COORDINATION MEETING </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  On 30 April, The DART attended the weekly IO/NGO </p><p>coordination meeting hosted by the Ministry of Humanitarian Aid </p><p>and Cooperation (MOHAC).  The meeting was well attended with over </p><p>50 participants representing various ministries of the Kurdish </p><p>Regional Government, the Office of Reconstruction and </p><p>Humanitarian Assistance (ORHA), CMOC, U.N., and international and </p><p>local NGOs. </p><p> </p><p>12.  The meeting opened with news of the return of U.N. </p><p>international staff.  A representative of U.N. Office for the </p><p>Humanitarian Coordination for Iraq (UNOCHI) explained that on 23 </p><p>April, six World Food Program (WFP) and the United Nations </p><p>Children\'s Fund (UNICEF) staff arrived.  On 24 April, 29 more </p><p>staff from UNOHCI, UNICEF, U.N. Development Program, and UNOPS </p><p>arrived in northern Iraq.  The MOHAC Minister noted that the </p><p>future of UNSCR 986 and the role of the U.N. in post-war Iraq </p><p>still remains unclear.  The UNOHCI representative explained that </p><p>the post-war period would be marked with greater cooperation with </p><p>NGOs.  (Note: Prior to the war, the U.N. could not work with </p><p>NGOs, as most were considered illegal by the former regime.  End </p><p>Note.)  The UNOCHI representative could not confirm that the U.N. </p><p>would have an official relationship with NGOs, although he hoped </p><p>to have more insight on the issue next week. </p><p> </p><p>13.  UNOHCI also explained that under the terms of UNSCR 986, </p><p>Mosul and Kirkuk would continue to be funded out of the portion </p><p>dedicated to the former Government of Iraq-controlled territory. </p><p>When asked whether PUK or KDP governorates were responsible for </p><p>these two areas, the MOHAC Minister commented, "I am not in a </p><p>position to give you a clear answer."  (Note: PUK was not </p><p>represented at this meeting.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p>14.  CMOC provided a security brief, stating that during daylight </p><p>hours, Kirkuk is permissible and Mosul is semi-permissive.  They </p><p>also mentioned that there are now CMOCs in Kirkuk and Mosul, and </p><p>that they continue to produce assessments for NGO use. </p><p> </p><p>15.  NGOs gave brief summaries of their work during the last </p><p>week.  Of note, Medair stated that there was great need for </p><p>assistance to returning IDPs, noting that there are 10,000 people </p><p>living in mosques and barracks in Mosul that are in need of </p><p>emergency aid, including food and clothing.  (Comment:  As was </p><p>obvious in this and previous meetings, many NGOs are working in </p><p>similar sectors in the same geographical area, e.g., health in </p><p>Makmour, with little or no coordination.  Even as NGOs share </p><p>information about assessments and areas in which they are </p><p>working, no organization has emerged that can help coordinate </p><p>these NGOs to prevent duplication of efforts or gaps in the </p><p>provision of services.  End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
