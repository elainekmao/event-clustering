<p>UNCLAS HANOI 000396 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINS, PTER, IZ, VM </p><p>SUBJECT:  "PROTESTING" FOR PEACE IN IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>REF:  FBIS SEP20030219000040 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  According to press reports, over 1,300 people </p><p>turned up for a rally at Hanoi\'s downtown Cultural and </p><p>Friendship Hall (a gift from the then-Soviet Union) on </p><p>February 18 to demonstrate solidarity with the people of </p><p>Iraq, express opposition to war and embargoes against Iraq, </p><p>and to call for a "political solution" in accordance with </p><p>the UN Charter, international law, and national independence </p><p>and sovereignty.  (Reftel carries text of the resolution </p><p>passed at the meeting, which received extensive media </p><p>coverage.)  Organizers included the Vietnam Fatherland Front </p><p>(a Communist Party of Vietnam organization), the Vietnam </p><p>Peace Committee, the Vietnam-Iraq Friendship Association, </p><p>and the Vietnam Committee for Solidarity and Cooperation </p><p>with Asian, Africa, and Latin American People. </p><p>Representatives from veterans, religious, workers, </p><p>intellectuals, ethnic minorities, and other groups </p><p>reportedly attended. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  Several speakers highlighted Vietnam\'s own </p><p>experiences as victim of war in sparking the "deep sympathy" </p><p>of the Vietnamese people toward the Iraqi people and the </p><p>desire to avoid further disruption to Iraqi lives.  The </p><p>Secretary General of the Vietnam Fatherland Front lamented </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>"strengthened military pressure" by the U.S., UK, and </p><p>Australia and against Iraq, and expressed worry about these </p><p>"threats to the peace and stability of the world."  Another </p><p>speaker claimed war against Iraq would "violate </p><p>international law and principle."  Another speaker noted </p><p>that even many people in the U.S. and UK sought peace and </p><p>opposed a war in Iraq.  Another noted that "U.S. and UK </p><p>authorities should not proceed with a war against Iraq . . . </p><p>and should avoid causing additional hardships" for the </p><p>people of Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  Septel will report on a similar meeting organized </p><p>in Ho Chi Minh City on February 18, which also received </p><p>extensive media coverage. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  Comment:  Events like these are carefully staged by </p><p>the CPV\'s "mass organizations" only after blessing from </p><p>senior CPV officials, and do not necessarily reflect genuine </p><p>popular opinion.  Nonetheless, the negative media coverage </p><p>of the U.S. build-up in the Gulf region and our diplomatic </p><p>efforts, the prominent coverage given recently to </p><p>international anti-war protests, and the media sympathy </p><p>expressed repeatedly for the Iraqi people have likely </p><p>succeeded in raising public distrust of U.S. intentions and </p><p>opposition to military action against one of Vietnam\'s </p><p>"traditional friends."  Neither the CPV or GVN would be </p><p>willing to permit spontaneous public demonstrations, </p><p>however; they would view this as a threat to social </p><p>stability and public order.  It is not improbable that these </p><p>same mass organizations will be permitted, encouraged, or </p><p>instructed to stage street protests near U.S. diplomatic </p><p>facilities after the outset of any military campaign in </p><p>Iraq, although authorities will be careful not to let them </p><p>get out of control. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p></p></div>
