<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ISLAMABAD 006509 </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR SA/PAB, DS, AND S/CT; CENTCOM/CINCPAC ALSO FOR POLAD; </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/SUTPHIN; PARIS FOR RAVELING </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  8/29/03 </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, PREL, MOPS, PK </p><p>SUBJECT:  PAKISTAN:  A CONVERSATION WITH BENAZIR BHUTTO </p><p> </p><p>(U) CLASSIFIED BY JOHN R. SCHMIDT, POLITICAL COUNSELOR. </p><p>REASON 1.5(D). </p><p> </p><p>1.   (C)  SUMMARY:  WITH HER RIVAL NAWAZ SHARIF IN DEEP POLITICAL </p><p>TROUBLE, FORMER PRIME MINISTER BENAZIR BHUTTO IS SEEKING TO </p><p>RESHAPE HER IMAGE AND REVIVE HER OWN TATTERED POLITICAL FORTUNES. </p><p>IN A WIDE-RANGING CONVERSATION WITH POLCOUNS ON AUGUST 27, SHE </p><p>CONDEMNED THE GROWING INFLUENCE OF THE ISLAMIC RIGHT, ADVOCATED </p><p>DRASTICALLY REDUCING THE SIZE OF GOVERNMENT, CALLED FOR THE END </p><p>OF POLITICAL PATRONAGE IN THE CIVIL SERVICE AND EXPRESSED </p><p>INTEREST IN PARTICIPATING IN AN ALL-PARTY CONSENSUS GOVERNMENT </p><p>WHEN AND IF THE NAWAZ REGIME FALLS .  WILLING ENOUGH TO ADMIT HER </p><p>OWN MISTAKES, SHE SEEMED ANXIOUS TO PORTRAY HERSELF TO A U.S. </p><p>AUDIENCE AS A MODERATE, SECULAR, PRO-WESTERN ALTERNATIVE TO THE </p><p>CURRENT POLITICAL FORCES AT LARGE IN THE COUNTRY.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>2.   QNGERS FROM THE RELIGIOUS RIGHT.  ALTHOUGH NO </p><p>FRIEND OF NAWAZ SHARIF, BENAZIR EXPRESSED DEEP CONCERN THAT THE </p><p>POLITICAL WEAKNESS OF THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT, DESPITE ITS </p><p>OVERWHELMING PARLIAMENTARY MAJORITY, WAS PLAYING INTO THE HANDS </p><p>OF THE EXTREMIST ISLAMIC RELIGIOUS PARTIES, PREEMINENTLY THE </p><p>JAMAAT-I-ISLAMI AND THE JAMAAT-ULEMA-I-ISLAMI.  SHE FEARED THAT, </p><p>IF THE SHARPLY DETERIORATING ECONOMY BEGAN TO BRING PEOPLE OUT </p><p>INTO THE STREETS, THESE ELEMENTS WOULD MAKE COMMON CAUSE WITH </p><p>SYMPATHETIC RETIRED GENERALS FROM THE ZIA ERA TO SPEARHEAD A </p><p>FUNDAMENTALIST ISLAMIC TAKEOVER.  SHE NOTED THAT THE NEWSPAPERS </p><p>WERE FULL OF ARTICLES BY INFLUENTIAL FORMER GENERALS MAKING </p><p>COMMON CAUSE WITH THE RELIGIOUS RIGHT.  (COMMENT:  WE DOUBT SHE </p><p>REALLY BELIEVES THAT HEADLINE-GRABBERS SUCH AS FORMER COAS MIRZA </p><p>ALSAM BEG AND FORMER DG/ISI HAMEED GUL ARE A THREAT.) </p><p> </p><p>3.   (C)  ON THE ARMY.  BENAZIR SAID SHE THOUGHT THERE WERE ALSO </p><p>PLENTY OF ACTIVE DUTY MID-LEVEL ARMY OFFICERS SYMPATHETIC TO THE </p><p>ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALIST CAUSE.  THE TOP ARMY LEADERSHIP, HOWEVER, </p><p>REMAINED SOLID AND MODERATE.  INDEED, SHE CONCEDED THAT ARMY </p><p>INTERVENTION OF SOME SORT COULD BE THE ONLY WAY TO AVERT A </p><p>FUNDAMENTALIST TAKEOVER IF THE NAWAZ GOVERNMENT BEGAN TO CRUMBLE. </p><p>SHE THOUGHT THE ARMY COULD PLAY A POSITIVE ROLE BY SETTING UP A </p><p>TECHNOCRATIC GOVERNMENT THAT WOULD INCLUDE REPRESENTATIVES FROM </p><p>ALL MAJOR POLITICAL PARTIES, INCLUDING HER OWN PPP AND NAWAZ\'S </p><p>PML (WITHOUT NAWAZ, OF COURSE).  BUT SHE WAS HIGHLY SKEPTICAL </p><p>THAT THE ARMY COULD RULE EFFECTIVELY ON ITS OWN BASED ON ITS PAST </p><p>PERFORMANCE. </p><p> </p><p>4.   (C) ON NAWAZ.  BENAZIR MADE NO EFFORT TO HIDE HER DISLIKE OF </p><p>NAWAZ SHARIF, WHOM SHE REGARDED AS BOTH WEAK AND NOT VERY BRIGHT. </p><p>SHE APPEARED TO HARBOR AN EVEN GREATER DISLIKE FOR HIS BROTHER </p><p>SHAHBAZ, WHO SHE CHARACTERIZED AS MORE INTELLIGENT, BUT ALSO MORE </p><p>BRUTAL, RELATING A BRIEF ANECDOTE ABOUT HOW HE HAD ORDERED A </p><p>HAPLESS BUREAUCRAT THROWN INTO A SEWER IN A MOMENT OF PERSONAL </p><p>PIQUE.  INTERESTINGLY, SHE WAS INCLINED TO ATTRIBUTE NAWAZ\'S </p><p>GROWING FLIRTATION WITH ISLAMIZATION TO HIS OWN LIGHTS RATHER </p><p>THAN SIMPLY TO POLITICAL OPPORTUNISM.  SHE CONTENDED THAT NAWAZ\'S </p><p>FATHER HAD BEEN VERY CLOSE TO "TALIBANISH" (HER WORD) ULEMA </p><p>(RELIGIOUS LEADERS) IN LAHORE AND HAD INCULCATED THESE SORTS OF </p><p>VALUES IN THE YOUNG NAWAZ.  SHE SAID THAT NAWAZ HAD DONE THE SAME </p><p>TO HIS OWN SON, NOTING THAT THE YOUNGER SHARIF HAD REFUSED TO </p><p>GIVE HIS AGE WHEN INTERVIEWED RECENTLY ON TELEVISION IN KEEPING </p><p>WITH A CONSERVATIVE ISLAMIC SUPERSTITION. </p><p> </p><p>5.   (C) ON HER OWN MISTAKES.  ASKED WHAT SHE WOULD DO </p><p>DIFFQHAD IT TO DO ALL OVER AGAIN, BENAZIR SAID SQ </p><p>WOULD ENDED THE PATRONAGE SYSTEM THAT LAID THE BASIS FOR THE </p><p>WIDESPREAD PUBLIC PERCEPTION OF HER AS CORRUPT.  SHE LAMENTED </p><p>THAT THERE HAD DEVELOPED IN PAKISTAN A SYSTEM IN WHICH EACH </p><p>INCOMING GOVERNMENT PACKED THE CIVIL SERVICE WITH ITS OWN </p><p>CRONIES.  THIS WAS A RECIPE FOR BOTH INCOMPETENCE AND CORRUPTION. </p><p>SHE HAD BEEN AS GUILTY OF THE PRACTICE AS ANY OTHER GOVERNMENT </p><p>LEADER BUT NO MORE SO.  SHE NOTED THAT SHE HAD YET TO BE </p><p>CONVICTED ON ANY CORRUPTION CHARGE DESPITE TWO YEARS OF </p><p>GOVERNMENT DIGGING.  NONETHELESS, THE PRACTICE OF PATRONAGE WAS </p><p>DESTRUCTIVE OF GOOD GOVERNMENT AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED BY AN </p><p>INDEPENDENT, PROFESSIONAL CIVIL SERVICE.  THIS WOULD BE A KEY </p><p>ELEMENT OF HER POLICY WERE SHE EVER TO RETURNQT: DURING THIS </p><p>EXCHANGE, SHE DID NOT MENTION HER HUSBAND, </p><p>WHO WAS HER CHIEF BAG MAN AND PATRONAGE DISPENSER.) </p><p> </p><p>6.   (C) ON THE ECONOMIC FAILINGS OF THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT. </p><p>HER CRITICISM OF GOVERNMENT ECONOMIC POLICIES WAS STANDARD FARE. </p><p>SHE SAID THE EFFORT TO FORCE THE INDEPENDENT POWER PRODUCERS </p><p>(IPPS) TO RENEGOTIATE THE CONTRACTS SIGNED BY HER REGIME HAD HAD </p><p>A CHILLING EFFECT ON FOREIGN INVESTMENT.  IT WAS ESSENTIAL FOR </p><p>GOVERNMENTS TO HONOR THE AGREEMENTS REACHED BY THEIR PREDECESSORS </p><p>EVEN IF THEY DID NOT LIKE THE TERMS.  OTHERWISE, THE </p><p>PREDICTABILITY AND CONFIDENCE SO ESSENTIAL TO ATTRACTING FOREIGN </p><p>INVESTMENT WOULD BE LACKING.  BENAZIR WAS ALSO HIGHLY CRITICAL OF </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT DECISION TO FREEZE HARD CURRENCY ACCOUNTS IN THE </p><p>WAKE OF ITS NUCLEAR TESTS.  SHE BELIEVED THE GOVERNMENT HAD NO </p><p>CLUE ABOUT HOW TO IMPROVE THE CURRENT ECONOMIC SITUATION SAVE FOR </p><p>BEGGING FROM RICH ARAB NEIGHBORS AND THROWING ITSELF ON THE MERCY </p><p>OF THE IMF. </p><p> </p><p>7.   (C) ON OTHER ASPECTS OF HER OWN PROGRAM.  IN ADDITION TO </p><p>PROFESSIONALIZING THE CIVIL SERVICE, BENAZIR SAID SHE STRONGLY </p><p>FAVORED DOWNSIZING GOVERNMENT AT ALL LEVELS.  GOVERNMENT-OWNED </p><p>ENTERPRISES SHOULD BE SOLD OFF AND THE NUMBER OF GOVERNMENT </p><p>MINISTRIES AND BUREAUCRATS SHARPLY REDUCED.  THE MILITARY BUDGET </p><p>WOULD ALSO NEED TO BE REDUCED.  PAKISTAN COULD NOT PRETEND TO </p><p>MATCH INDIA SOLDIER FOR SOLDIER AND MACHINE FOR MACHINE AND WOULD </p><p>NEED TO TAILOR ITS FOREIGN POLICY TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS REALITY. </p><p>AS FOR THE RELIGIOUS RIGHT, SHE SAID SHE FAVORED SHUTTING DOWN </p><p>THE MADARASSA SCHOOLS THAT WERE CHURNING OUT SO MANY YOUNG </p><p>FUNDAMENTALISTS.  HER BASIC THEME, HOWEVER, WAS THAT THE BEST WAY </p><p>TO COMBAT FUNDAMENTALISM WAS TO IMPROVE THE ECONOMY BY ENDING </p><p>CORRUPTION, DOWNSIZING GOVERNMENT AND ATTRACTING FOREIGN </p><p>INVESTMENT. </p><p> </p><p>8.   (C) ON RELATIONS WITH THE U.S. AND THE WEST.  BENAZIR TOLD </p><p>POLCOUNS SHE HAD SEEN PRESS REPORTS THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAD </p><p>AGREED TO SIGN THE CTBT DURING THE SHAMSHAD-TALBOTT TALKS IN </p><p>LONDON ON AUGUST 25.  SHE HOPED THIS WAS TRUE, SINCE PAKISTAN </p><p>COULD NOT AFFORD A NUCLEAR ARMS RACE WITH INDIA OR BAD RELATIONS </p><p>WITH THE UNITED STATES.  SHE SAID THAT ONE POSITIVE RESULT </p><p>FLOWING FROM THE MAY NUCLEAR TESTS WAS ITS IMPACT ON THE U.S. </p><p>THE TESTS HAD FORCED THE UNITED STATES TO PAY GREATER ATTENTION </p><p>TO PAKISTAN.  PAKISTAN NEEDED ACTIVE U.S. ENGAGEMENT AND SHE </p><p>HOPED THE UNITED STATES WOULD CONTINUE TO PLAY AN ACTIVE ROLE IN </p><p>THE REGION. </p><p> </p><p>9.   (C) ON THE TALIBAN AND BIN LADEN.  BENAZIR SAID SHE HAD </p><p>STRONGLY CONDEMNED THE EAST AFRICA BOMBINGS AND WAS STRONGLY </p><p>OPPOSED TO TERRORISM OF ANY KIND.  BUT SHE FELT THE U.S. SHOULD </p><p>HAVE PURSUED USAMA BIN LADEN THROUGH THE UN PROCESS IN THE FIRST </p><p>INSTANCE, PARTICULARLY SINCE THE AUGUST 20 CRUISE MISSILE STRIKES </p><p>HAD ALIENATED PUBLIC OPINION THROUGHOUT THE ISLAMIC WORLD.  SHE </p><p>SAID SHE WAS NO FAN OF THE TALIBAN, WHOM SHE VIEWED AS AN </p><p>EXTENSION OF THE RELIGIOUS RIGHT IN PAKISTAN.  INDEED, SHE WAS </p><p>FEARFUL THAT RETURNING TALIBAN MIGHT SERVE AS FOOT SOLDIERS FOR </p><p>RELIGIOUS EXTREMISTS IN A FUTURE CONFRONTATION WITH AUTHORITIES. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) ON WHAT IS GOING RIGHT IN PAKISTAN.  DESPITE HER </p><p>OPPOSITION TO THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT AND FEAR OF ISLAMIC </p><p>FUNDAMENTALISM, BENAZIR SAID SHE BELIEVED THERE HAD BEEN MANY </p><p>POSITIVE DEVELOPMENTS IN PAKISTAN IN THE TEN YEARS SINCE THE </p><p>DEATH OF ZIA (AUGUST 17, 1988) AND RETURN OF DEMOCRACY.  ALTHOUGH </p><p>SHE HAD FELT ITS STING MORE THAN ANY OTHER PAKISTANI POLITICIAN, </p><p>SHE WAS PROUD OF THE FACT THAT PAKISTAN HAD DEVELOPED A </p><p>REMARKABLY FREE PRESS, WHICH SHE BELIEVED WAS AN ESSENTIAL </p><p>UNDERPINNING OF GENUINE DEMOCRACY.  SHE SAID SHE ALSO BELIEVED </p><p>THAT THE JUDICIARY HAD ACHIEVED A LARGE MEASURE OF INDEPENDENCE, </p><p>ALTHOUGH IT REMAINED UNDER CONSIDERABLE PRESSURE FROM POLITICAL </p><p>AUTHORITIES.  SHE ALSO THOUGHT THAT ORDINARY PAKISTANIS HAD BEGUN </p><p>TO THINK FOR THEMSELVES AND TO QUESTION WHAT THEY WERE TOLD BY </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT AND BY POLITICIANS RATHER THAN PASSIVELY ACCEPT </p><p>SIMPLISTIC SLOGANS AS WAS PREVIOUSLY THE CASE. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) ON HER CURRENT POLITICAL SITUATION.  BENAZIR SAID SHE </p><p>THOUGHT THE WEAKNESS OF THE NAWAZ GOVERNMENT HAD IMPROVED HER OWN </p><p>POLITICAL POSITION IN THE COUNTRY.  SHE THOUGHT SHE WAS STRONG IN </p><p>RURAL AREAS, BUT REMAINED WEAK IN URBAN PUNJAB.  SHE RUED THE </p><p>FACT THAT THE ELECTORAL WEAKNESS OF HER OWN PPP PARTY (REDUCED IN </p><p>THE LAST ELECTION TO ITS SINDHI BASE) HAD FORCED HER TO MAKE </p><p>COMMON CAUSE WITH SOME OF THE SMALLER, MORE EXTREMIST RELIGIOUS </p><p>PARTIES UNDER THE  PAKISTAN AWAMI ITIHAT (PAI) UMBRELLA.  BUT SHE </p><p>FELT THAT HER PARTY WAS NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO CARRY THE BURDEN OF </p><p>OPPOSITION ON ITS OWN.  MORE RECENTLY, SHE HAD ALSO BEGAN </p><p>REACHING OUT TO SOME OF THE NATIONALIST REGIONAL PARTIES, SUCH AS </p><p>THE NORTHWEST FRONTIER PROVINCE-BASED ANP.  HOWEVER, WHEN ASKED </p><p>HOW SHE COULD MANEUVER FROM WHERE SHE WAS NOW BACK INTO A </p><p>POSITION OF POWER HER ONLY COMMENT WAS A RUEFUL "THAT IS THE 64 </p><p>DOLLAR QUESTION." </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) COMMENT.  BENAZIR WAS RELAXED AND TALKATIVE DURING A </p><p>CONVERSATION THAT STRETCHED ON FOR NINETY MINUTES.  HER COMMENTS </p><p>WERE CLEARLY CALCULATED TO GO DOWN WELL WITH AN AMERICAN AUDIENCE </p><p>AND SHE CLEARLY SEEMS TO BE POSITIONING HERSELF AS A MODERATE, </p><p>SECULAR, MORE WESTERN-ORIENTED ALTERNATIVE TO THE CURRENT </p><p>GOVERNMENT AND ITS EVEN MORE FUNDAMENTALIST FOES.  SHE HAS </p><p>RECENTLY TURNED FOR ADVICE TO A MODERATE FORMER MILITARY OFFICER, </p><p>RETIRED GENERAL TALAT MASOOD, WHO IS NOTED FOR PROMOTING THE NEED </p><p>FOR DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTION-BUILDING IN PAKISTAN.  AS FOR WHETHER </p><p>BENAZIR BELIEVES WHAT SHE IS SAYING, THAT IS HARD TO SAY.  HER </p><p>BEST CHANCE OF ONE DAY RETURNING TO POWER IS ALMOST CERTAINLY AS </p><p>PART OF A COALITION RATHER THAN ON HER OWN.  THAT MIGHT NOT BE A </p><p>BAD THING, GIVEN THAT, LEFT STRICTLY TO HER OWN DEVICES, SHE </p><p>WOULD REMAIN BEHOLDEN TO THE LANDLORDS OF HER FEUDAL SINDH BASE, </p><p>AND THESE ARE NOT THE SORT OF PEOPLE INTERESTED IN ENDING </p><p>PATRONAGE AND PROMOTING INSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRATIC REFORMS.  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MILAM </p><p></p></div>
