<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 002289 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/12/2011 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, EAID, MASS, MARR, KPKO, SL, NI, UNAMSIL </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: NSA MOHAMMED ON HUMANITRIAN ASSISTANCE </p><p>AND UNAMSIL ROTATION UPDATE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 143583 </p><p>     B. ABUJA 2117 </p><p>     C. STATE 151930 </p><p>     D. ABUJA 2218 </p><p>     E. ABUJA NI 2287 </p><p>     F. ABUJA 2286 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by CDA Andrews; Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) CDA Andrews called on NSA Aliyu Mohammed on 12 </p><p>September.  Mohammed echoed the words of President Obasanjo </p><p>regarding the terrorist attacks against the United States </p><p>(Ref F), and offered any and all assistance to locating the </p><p>perpetrators and bringing them to justice.  Andrews thanked </p><p>the NSA for the quick reaction of the Nigerian security </p><p>establishment to protect the Embassy and American lives and </p><p>property in Nigeria. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Andrews provided the NSA a briefing on the trip to </p><p>Kano and Jigawa States using OFR helicopters, and informed </p><p>the NSA that we expected an OFDA team in the following days, </p><p>assuming they did not have pressing duties in the United </p><p>States.  Mohammed thanked the Embassy profusely for the </p><p>goodwill gesture, noted he had informed both the President </p><p>and the Vice President of the Embassy\'s efforts and stated </p><p>that the OFDA team would be welcome, if they were able to </p><p>come. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Andrews noted the Embassy had received a letter from </p><p>the Senate President and the Speaker of the House requesting </p><p>an MPRI program to enhance the oversight capabilities of the </p><p>National Assembly Defense Committees. (COMMENT:  Both the NSA </p><p>and President had previously expressed reservation about MPRI </p><p>working with the National Assembly.  END COMMENT.)  Andrews </p><p>noted that, since Nigeria was a democracy, the Embassy could </p><p>not "lightly set aside" such a request when signed by the </p><p>presiding officers of both houses.  Mohammed replied that he </p><p>was an early supporter of the MPRI program, and said he would </p><p>discuss the Assembly\'s request with Senate President Anyim </p><p>that afternoon, and ask the Assembly leaders to also discuss </p><p>their interest in MPRI with President Obasanjo. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Andrews informed the NSA of recent discussions of </p><p>UNAMSIL troop rotations, including the initial request to </p><p>keep one Nigerian battalion in Sierra Leone until January </p><p>(Ref A) and the President\'s decision to support the request </p><p>(Ref B).  Andrews also told the NSA of the subsequent request </p><p>made to the Acting Minister of Defense that one Nigerian </p><p>battalion be replaced by a Senegalese OFR-trained battalion </p><p>(Ref C and D).  Finally, Andrews explained that we understood </p><p>that the Army had not received new orders and was proceeding </p><p>on its original orders (Ref E), which caused us some concern. </p><p> Mohammed asked that the Embassy work with his Military </p><p>Advisor LTC Idris to resolve the matter.  (NOTE: CDA sent LTC </p><p>Idris a letter, at his urging, explaining in detail the </p><p>requested rotation changes.  END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) After returning from the meeting, PolMilOff spoke with </p><p>Balarabe Lawal, SA to the Army Minister (Batagarawa is seized </p><p>with a visit of the Chinese Defense Minister).  Lawal stated </p><p>that Minister Danjuma himself had approved the rotation </p><p>changes when checking in with his office during his leave. </p><p>Lawal then checked with the Personal Staff Officer to the </p><p>Minister, at PolMilOff\'s urging, to confirm that the Army had </p><p>been informed.  Lawal reported that the Army had not been </p><p>informed, and that Chief of Defense Staff VADM Ibrahim Ogohi </p><p>had also sent a letter on the rotations.  The decision was </p><p>being held in abeyance until the Minister could consider all </p><p>of the information received.  COMMENT: We assume this means </p><p>that Ogohi is again creating obstacles.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) DATT COMMENT: According to Colonel Operations, Colonel </p><p>Kaka, as of 12SEP01 1300, the Army was proceeding on the </p><p>original schedule, i.e. rotation of two Nigerian battalions </p><p>on 17 September.  END DATT COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) Freetown minimize considered. </p><p>Andrews </p><p></p></div>
