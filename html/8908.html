<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 HO CHI MINH CITY 000572 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EAP/BCLTV, INR/B </p><p>USDOC FOR 3132 USFCS/OIO EAP/A. BACHER </p><p> </p><p>E. O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, ECON, SENV, SOCI, PREL, EINV </p><p>SUBJECT: NEWEST HCMC VICE CHAIRMAN: BAD HABITS TO BLAME FOR </p><p>TRAFFIC, SEWAGE, LAND USE PROBLEMS </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  HCMC People\'s Committee\'s newest Vice Chairman, Nguyen </p><p>Van Dua, discussed urban planning and quality of life issues with </p><p>Consul General in an initial courtesy call on June 11.  Vice </p><p>Chairman Dua focused on HCMC\'s serious waste management, land use </p><p>and trafffic issues, and its efforts to attract investment for </p><p>municipal projects.  He also discussed ideas for vocational </p><p>training and policies regarding construction and urban </p><p>development. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>NO ONE WANTS TO TOUCH IT: SEWAGE AND WASTE DISPOSAL </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  The Consul General paid a courtesy call on Mr. Nguyen </p><p>Van Dua, the newest of the HCMC People\'s Committee\'s five vice- </p><p>chairmen, on June 11.  The 45-minute discussion focused on urban </p><p>planning and quality of life in HCMC, as well as waste management, </p><p>vocational training, and investment efforts.  According to the Mr. </p><p>Dua (hard D), the municipal authorities are deeply concerned about </p><p>current inadequate methods for dealing with the large amounts of </p><p>waste produced daily.  Waste management problems are exacerbated </p><p>by leaks in antiquated water and sewage pipes.  While local and </p><p>Dutch scientists were working to address the waste issue, they had </p><p>yet to find solutions.  HCMC needed a more comprehensive approach, </p><p>to include use of new technologies for landfill, composting, and </p><p>waste-to-energy conversion. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  Asked why he thought foreign investors had yet to </p><p>express real interest in waste management projects, Vice Chairman </p><p>Dua blamed delays in land planning for disposal sites and poor </p><p>management practices.  In the past, civil servants had focused on </p><p>questionable sites, failing to take into consideration the impact </p><p>of drive time, environmental hazards, and other factors.  The HCMC </p><p>government was making adjustments, but the impact had yet to be </p><p>felt.  While one investor group had developed a plan to process </p><p>waste into energy, the costs were too high.  HCMC still needs </p><p>modern waste disposal technology -- but at an affordable cost. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  According to Mr. Dua, HCMC is studying new ideas for </p><p>managing waste, including the use of city waterways, rather than </p><p>roads, for transportation.  At the same time, the government is </p><p>working to raise awareness and encourage sorting and </p><p>classification of trash at the household level. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>BETTER MANAGEMENT THROUGH VOCATIONAL TRAINING </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  Vice Chairman Dua noted the importance of improved and </p><p>expanded vocational training to raise the quality of the </p><p>workforce.  Only 30 percent of the labor pool has professional </p><p>skills at present, but HCMC hopes to raise that figure to 40 </p><p>percent in the near future.  The Vice Chairman expressed interest </p><p>in working with San Francisco, within the framework of the Sister </p><p>City relationship, to meet training needs.  In particular, he </p><p>emphasized the importance of training line supervisors to organize </p><p>and manage their workers. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  Asked to choose between joint-venture, general use </p><p>vocational schools throughout the city, or more specialized </p><p>vocational schools to supply existing industrial parks, Vice </p><p>Chairman Dua saw value in both -- one for improving the labor pool </p><p>at large, the other for meeting specific labor needs.  He looked </p><p>forward to discussing appropriate sectors with any interested </p><p>investor with sufficient capital.  He also cited HCMC\'s need for a </p><p>detailed analysis of labor supply and demand. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>HCMC\'S FAMOUS TRAFFIC CHAOS ON THE DECLINE? </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU)  Despite signs of improvement in dealing with HCMC\'s </p><p>"famous" traffic problem, Vice Chairman Dua was not satisfied that </p><p>sufficient progress had been made.  Traffic deaths and injuries </p><p>are reportedly down 30 percent compared to last year, but the city </p><p>government wants to reduce accidents to the lowest level possible. </p><p>The Vice Chairman stressed that easing traffic flow and making </p><p>travel within the city safer and more convenient was essential to </p><p>improving quality of life for visitors and residents alike. </p><p>Public transport is a top priority, and the city is looking at </p><p>ways to convince people to take advantage of existing options. </p><p>Buses are currently the primary means of transport, but city </p><p>planners are examining other options.  Vice Chairman Dua asked the </p><p>CG to encourage American companies to participate in </p><p>transportation projects and expressed his eagerness to accept </p><p>recommendations for technical assistance and investment from the </p><p>U.S. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>URBAN PLANNING NIGHTMARES </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU)  Turning to other large infrastructure and construction </p><p>projects, Vice Chairman Dua noted his disappointment with the </p><p>Saigon South development, citing the modest number of projects </p><p>underway in the relatively large (2600 hectare) area.  He had high </p><p>praise, however, for the Thu Thiem New Urban Area Project (which </p><p>he managed just prior to his promotion in February of this year). </p><p>HCMC is soliciting anonymous design proposals and bringing in a </p><p>jury of international architects to help select the optimal </p><p>design.  (Note: Results for the Thu Thiem development project </p><p>should be announced o/a July 10, 2003.)  Mr. Dua said he expected </p><p>bidding packages to go out in October, and encouraged American </p><p>participation at every stage.  Construction on a new East-West </p><p>highway is expected to begin in November, and general upgrades are </p><p>planned for the downtown business district. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU)  Calling the Vietnamese mindset a "disaster" for urban </p><p>planning, the Vice Chairman blamed many of the city\'s housing </p><p>problems on the poor quality of existing residential options. </p><p>Given the choice, most people preferred to live in their own </p><p>houses rather than apartments, leading to a constant effort to out- </p><p>build one another.  From Mr. Dua\'s point of view, the new </p><p>construction is not only of dubious quality, but the architectural </p><p>designs are "ugly."  While better apartment quality would </p><p>certainly help, any real improvement would require a fundamental </p><p>change in attitude.  There is district-level authority to approve </p><p>most residential construction, but illegal buying and selling of </p><p>land is difficult to control, as is building without a permit. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU)  Vice Chairman Dua stressed the need to change the </p><p>mindset and behavior of HCMC\'s population in order to deal more </p><p>responsibly with both urban planning and waste management issues. </p><p>He said 2003 had been declared the "Year of Restoring Order in </p><p>Public Life," during which time efforts would be made to change </p><p>attitudes on littering, driving, construction, and other urban </p><p>issues.  He remarked that the SEAGAMES (Southeast Asia </p><p>Games)competition to be hosted by Vietnam in December 2003 might </p><p>provide an opportunity for the HCMC government to launch public </p><p>sanitation and anti-litter campaigns. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (SBU)  Asked to estimate the actual population of HCMC (some </p><p>official publications still list the figure as 6 million), Vice </p><p>Chairman Dua pointed to the large number of temporary residents </p><p>and the huge migratory influx of job-seekers from the provinces as </p><p>complicating an accurate count.  Describing the need to better </p><p>manage the division of labor between HCMC and neighboring </p><p>provinces, he hoped HCMC could move toward attracting a more </p><p>highly skilled, white-collar workforce to stabilize the </p><p>population.  When pressed, he did not contradict a population </p><p>estimate of "more than 8 million." </p><p> </p><p>12.  (SBU)  Vice Chairman Dua asked the CG for her "frank </p><p>observations" on the current state of the relationship between </p><p>city government and the population it served.  Noting that ConGen </p><p>staff were generally quite pleased to call HCMC home, she cited </p><p>police responsiveness as one specific area for improvement. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>STRENGTHENING THE SISTERHOOD </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  (SBU)  Vice Chairman Dua asked the CG to recommend specific </p><p>areas for cooperation with HCMC\'s Sister City in the U.S.  Noting </p><p>San Francisco\'s  reputation as being progressive and open-minded, </p><p>she recommended pursuing cultural and educational exchanges, mass </p><p>transit projects, fire prevention and safety training, vocational </p><p>training, and environmental improvement programs.  She also </p><p>mentioned that Chief Mario Trevino of the San Francisco Fire </p><p>Department hoped to visit Hanoi and HCMC in August to participate </p><p>in a jointly-organized Fire Prevention and Safety Conference. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>LOCAL BOY MAKES GOOD </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  (SBU)  Vice Chairman Dua assumed his new position as one of </p><p>HCMC\'s five Vice Chairmen in February 2003.  His portfolio </p><p>includes transportation, public works, land administration, </p><p>construction, and urban management.  He served previously on the </p><p>Project Management Board for the Thu Thiem New Urban Area for one </p><p>year, and as Secretary of the HCMC District 3 Party Committee for </p><p>five years before that.  He was Secretary of the HCMC Youth Union, </p><p>a traditional stepping-stone to prominence in city and national </p><p>politics, during 1992-1996.  Vice Chairman Dua holds an advanced </p><p>degree in politics, and bachelor\'s degrees in economics and law. </p><p>He understands/speaks some English. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>15.  (SBU)  ConGen first requested this initial courtesy call more </p><p>than two months ago, after Vice Chairman Dua indicated his </p><p>interest in meeting after a serendipitous encounter with the CG at </p><p>a representational event.  However, when we requested an </p><p>appointment, we were told that the new Vice Chairman was "not </p><p>ready", as he was still getting acquainted with his portfolio. </p><p>Having now seen Mr. Dua in action, it is clear he is comfortable </p><p>with his new responsibilities and willing to speak openly with USG </p><p>officials.  Our External Relations Office contacts say he has </p><p>already earned a reputation as a hard worker (in the office by </p><p>7:00 a.m., does not leave until after 9:00 p.m.), and is more </p><p>"openly emotional." </p><p> </p><p>16.  (SBU) Vice hairman Dua was confident and engaged throughout </p><p>the meeting, asking as many questions as he answered.  His </p><p>requests for feedback and criticism from the CG were bold and </p><p>unusual in a first meeting in the Vietnamese context.  This may </p><p>indicate that the powers-that-be continue to recognize the </p><p>importance of assigning outward-looking non-ideologues to </p><p>administer Vietnam\'s dynamic economic engine.  That said, HCMC </p><p>covers a huge metropolitan area, with many of the same pluses and </p><p>minuses of developing world cities anywhere.  Given budget </p><p>realities and varying levels of central government control, it </p><p>would be unrealistic to expect that even the most enlightened city </p><p>officials could solve such massive infrastructure and public </p><p>service problems anytime soon. </p><p>YAMAUCHI </p><p></p></div>
