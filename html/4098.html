<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 05 COLOMBO 002003 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS; NSC FOR E. MILLARD </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/28/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PINR, PINS, EAID, ELAB, CE, LTTE - Peace Process, Political Parties </p><p>SUBJECT: SRI LANKA: DAS CAMP AFFIRMS U.S. SUPPORT FOR PEACE </p><p>PROCESS </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) COLOMBO 2000 (B) COLOMBO 1992 (C) COLOMBO 1858 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Deputy Chief of Mission W. Lewis Amselem: Reasons 1.5 (b </p><p>,d) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary:  During his October 24-27 visit to Sri Lanka, </p><p>South Asia Bureau DAS Donald Camp delivered a message of firm </p><p>U.S. support for the peace process.  At the same time, Camp </p><p>encouraged both government and opposition leaders not to let </p><p>cohabitation stresses threaten the progress made thus far </p><p>toward peace.  Pressing the GSL to sign an ICC Article 98 </p><p>Agreement, Camp received continued assurances from the Prime </p><p>Minister that Sri Lanka would sign the agreement soon.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>The PM on Peace and Internal Politics </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) DAS Camp and the Ambassador called on Prime Minister </p><p>Ranil Wickremesinghe on October 24.  Camp opened the meeting </p><p>by expressing the high level of hope in the USG for Sri </p><p>Lanka\'s peace process.  As impressed as the U.S. is with what </p><p>Sri Lanka has achieved on peace, Camp continued, we are </p><p>concerned that internal politics might threaten the progress </p><p>made.  As reported ref A, Wickremesinghe then reviewed his </p><p>take on the current rift within the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress </p><p>(not a problem) and cohabitation strains with President </p><p>Kumaratunga (still a problem).  Camp asked Wickremesinghe </p><p>what his government could do to get the President\'s </p><p>unequivocal support for the peace process.  Wickremesinghe </p><p>said there was little hope of getting the President on board, </p><p>but asserted that his government for its part would continue </p><p>to try to work with her. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Camp told the PM he welcomed the appointment of </p><p>Devinda Subasinghe as Sri Lankan Ambassador in Washington. </p><p>Camp said he had known Subasinghe for years and that </p><p>Subasinghe himself knows Washington well; he would be an </p><p>asset to Sri Lanka.  The Ambassador suggested, as he has in </p><p>the past, that GSL might find it useful to post a Defense </p><p>Attache in Washington, in light of increasing military </p><p>exchanges between our two governments.  Wickremesighe said he </p><p>thought it was a good idea and would look into it further. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>Article 98 Agreement </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Camp thanked Wickremesinghe for his government\'s </p><p>"political decision" to sign an ICC Article 98 agreement, and </p><p>asked when Sri Lanka would be ready to sign. Wickremesinghe </p><p>recalled that he had assured A/S Rocca in New York (during a </p><p>meeting on the margins of the UNGA) that Sri Lanka would </p><p>sign; it is now just a question of getting the Foreign </p><p>Ministry bureaucracy to move.  Camp noted that many nations </p><p>had already signed Article 98 agreements with us.  Signing </p><p>soon would win GSL valuable positive attention among </p><p>Washington decision-makers; waiting too long could result in </p><p>other countries stealing Sri Lanka\'s thunder.  Wickremesinghe </p><p>assured Camp that he would push the MFA to sign soon. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Camp raised Article 98 in a meeting with Foreign </p><p>Minister Tyronne Fernando the following day, reiterating the </p><p>same points he made to the PM.  Fernando noted that the MFA </p><p>legal division had proposed an additional paragraph for the </p><p>agreement (ref B) that would make it easier for GSL to sign. </p><p>The Ambassador expressed skepticism that the additional </p><p>paragraph would be acceptable to Washington, saying that </p><p>Washington had put a lot of work into the text of the </p><p>agreement and that many other countries had signed it without </p><p>modifications.  Fernando asked Camp and the Ambassador to </p><p>await Washington\'s official response to the proposed </p><p>additional text and revisit the issue afterward, if necessary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>Key Ministers, GoN Ambassador Discuss Situation </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Over drinks at the Ambassador\'s Residence on October </p><p>25, DAS Camp met with G.L. Peiris and Milinda Moragoda, two </p><p>key ministers, and Norwegian Ambassador Jon Westborg.  G.L. </p><p>Peiris kicked off the discussion with a long discourse </p><p>focused on how much he distrusted President Kumaratunga.  On </p><p>this point, Peiris said the President wanted to destroy the </p><p>peace process to ensure her own political gain.  Her (October </p><p>24) speech made clear that she was laying the basis to </p><p>undermine government\'s peace initiative and also its economic </p><p>policies.  Peiris said this latter issue, in particular, was </p><p>of concern because the government was picking up much </p><p>criticism over cost of living increases and cuts in welfare </p><p>subsidies which had been mandated by the IMF.  He said he had </p><p>little doubt that the President was working in tandem with </p><p>the radical JVP (Janantha Vimukthi Peramuna) party to drive </p><p>home such points with the public in an effort to completely </p><p>undermine the PM.  Despite all the problems he had with the </p><p>President, Peiris said he still supported trying to work with </p><p>her in some way, including through regular briefings on the </p><p>status of the peace process, but he was not optimistic of </p><p>success. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Moragoda noted that it was this sort of criticism on </p><p>the economic front that made the government propose the </p><p>conference in Oslo in late November.  Moragoda added that the </p><p>GSL hoped that donors could announce "quick impact" projects </p><p>at the conference that would support the peace process in </p><p>this time of difficulty.  Westborg agreed that the conference </p><p>was critical, particularly as it came at a time when the </p><p>government was having a tough time getting the "economic </p><p>wheels turning."  Questioned about participation by other </p><p>countries, Moragoda said British Minister Clare Short had </p><p>indicated that she might be able to attend.  Norway and Sri </p><p>Lanka continued to work with India on the issue.  India was </p><p>naturally concerned about the issue of Tiger participation, </p><p>but Moragoda said he was reasonably confident that something </p><p>could be worked out.  Westborg confirmed that Anton </p><p>Balasingham, the Tigers\' spokesman and lead negotiator, would </p><p>represent the group in Oslo.  He noted that the Tigers had </p><p>been talked out of demanding "an equal seat at the table" </p><p>with the government in Oslo.  All they really wanted, </p><p>Westborg related, was to be "treated with dignity."  Both </p><p>Moragoda and Westborg expressed appreciation to Deputy </p><p>Secretary Armitage for his commitment to participate at the </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Oslo conference. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Asked about criticism from the President\'s party (such </p><p>as that from former Foreign Minister Kadirgamar) that the </p><p>government was not dealing with the tough issues in its talks </p><p>with the Tigers, Peiris replied that the government had no </p><p>intention of following a "failed" model.  Explaining his </p><p>point, Peiris said the previous government had wasted great </p><p>time (in 1999-2001) by demanding that the Tigers agree to </p><p>this or that point before agreeing to come to face-to-face </p><p>negotiations and in fact talks never did take place.  The </p><p>current government, however, was elected on a platform </p><p>committing itself to trying to end the war.  To implement </p><p>this objective, the government had decided to get to talks as </p><p>soon as possible, including by removing the legal ban on the </p><p>Tigers.  Peiris remarked that the government was committed to </p><p>a course of "consistent confidence-building" with the Tigers. </p><p> Once "confidence had been built," then the tough issues </p><p>could be grappled with -- "You cannot put the cart before the </p><p>horse in these matters," he underlined. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) In a separate meeting with Minister for Employment and </p><p>Labor and Chief Whip Mahinda Samarasinghe, DAS Camp heard </p><p>that the majority of MPs are committed to peace, and though </p><p>elections may consolidate the UNF\'s position, the negative </p><p>effects on the peace process would be unacceptable. </p><p>Samarasinghe criticized President Kumaratunga\'s actions, </p><p>saying that she is not acting in a way that recognizes that </p><p>she must get along with the PM.  He praised the Ambassador\'s </p><p>public and private support of the peace process and USAID\'s </p><p>assistance with his Productivity Policy.  Samarasinghe </p><p>discussed the strong role of labor unions and the difficulty </p><p>he is experiencing in passing labor reforms.  Camp explained </p><p>that the USG wants to support the peace process, as well as </p><p>economic and labor reforms, and that we will be as helpful as </p><p>we can.  Samarasinghe concluded with specific requests for </p><p>Dept. of Labor assistance to establish a Bureau of Labor </p><p>Statistics, and for USAID assistance to monitor the </p><p>implementation of the National Productivity Policy. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>Muslim Leader Reviews Party Infighting, Talks </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) DAS Camp and DCM also met with Rauf Hakeem, the </p><p>Minister of Ports and Shipping, and head of the Sri Lanka </p><p>Muslim Congress (SLMC).  Asked about the troubled situation </p><p>in his party (see ref A), Hakeem admitted that he was having </p><p>serious problems controlling a group of rebel SLMC MPs.  He </p><p>complained that the rebels had little understanding of the </p><p>complexities of negotiating with the Tamil Tigers, but </p><p>insisted on making demands that would make it impossible to </p><p>continue negotiations.  Hakeem said he understood that </p><p>Muslims in the east were worried about their situation given </p><p>the pressure they were under from the Tamil Tigers.  The </p><p>answer to their problems, however, was not to destroy the </p><p>peace process with unreasonable demands, but to work the </p><p>process so that Muslim views were truly heard.  In doing </p><p>this, Muslims should continue to demand and expect that </p><p>pressure would be put on the Tigers to honor the February </p><p>cease-fire accord.  The Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission (SLMM) </p><p>had to do a better job of holding the Tigers accountable for </p><p>their actions, particularly the Tiger-instigated hartals </p><p>(strikes), which were very destructive for Muslim businesses, </p><p>Hakeem stressed. </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) Queried about the second round of talks scheduled to </p><p>begin on October 31 in Thailand, Hakeem remarked that he </p><p>might not be attending.  His SLMC opponents would criticize </p><p>him no matter what he did and he was reluctant to give them </p><p>any openings at this time.  On the other hand, Hakeem </p><p>continued, he wanted to ensure that Muslims were not </p><p>forgotten in the peace process and that fact might motivate </p><p>him to attend.  Given all the pros-and-cons, he had not </p><p>finally made up his mind on the question of attending and </p><p>planned to meet the PM on October 26 to discuss the issue. </p><p>Hakeem added that it was also not clear when or whether he </p><p>would be meeting Tamil Tiger leader V. Prabhakaran.  (Note: </p><p>After the conclusion of the first round of talks in </p><p>mid-September, it was announced that Hakeem would meet with </p><p>Prabhakaran soon.)  Hakeem said the Tigers were giving </p><p>signals that they did not want the meeting to take place at </p><p>this time, perhaps because of the problems in the SLMC. </p><p>Hakeem said he was still willing to meet Prabhakaran, but was </p><p>not sure that a meeting would take place anytime soon. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>Meetings with the Opposition </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) DAS Camp focused on peace process and cohabitation </p><p>issues during his October 25 meeting with Mahinda Rajapakse, </p><p>Leader of the Opposition People\'s Alliance (PA).  Camp </p><p>queried Rajapakse on what the UNP has to do on the peace </p><p>process to satisfy the PA.  Rajapakse commented that the </p><p>President thinks the peace process "is her baby" and she </p><p>wants credit for it.  Camp cited a number of speeches made by </p><p>the Prime Minister acknowledging the President\'s early </p><p>efforts at peace.  Rajapakse said recognition is not enough; </p><p>the President and her party deserve a representative at the </p><p>talks. </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) Camp emphasized to Rajapakse the USG\'s hope that the </p><p>peace process not founder because of political problems in </p><p>Colombo.  The USG would like to see the parties cooperate on </p><p>the issue of peace, Camp said.  Rajapakse agreed, but </p><p>highlighted some concerns of the opposition.  First and </p><p>foremost, the LTTE is still recruiting and fundraising. </p><p>Second, many Sinhalese are convinced that the Norwegians are </p><p>too sympathetic to the LTTE, and many in the PA share that </p><p>concern.  Finally, the proposed Joint Task Force that is to </p><p>oversee development spending in the north and east must be </p><p>accountable to the Parliament, Rajapakse said; the people </p><p>will not be willing to let the LTTE control development </p><p>money.  Camp responded that the U.S. believes the Norwegians </p><p>are working in good faith for peace.  Regarding the Joint </p><p>Task Force, Camp said the U.S. always insists on proper </p><p>accountability procedures for its development assistance and </p><p>Sri Lanka will be no exception. </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) DAS Camp and Ambassador Wills met with former foreign </p><p>minister Lakshman Kadirgamar, a key adviser of President </p><p>Kumaratunga, on October 25.  Asked about the nationally </p><p>televised speech given by the President on October 24 (see </p><p>ref A), Kadirgamar commented that the President had had to </p><p>give the speech in order to highlight her concerns about the </p><p>direction of the peace process.  The President strongly </p><p>supported the objective of peace, but was concerned that the </p><p>government was not informing the country of exactly what it </p><p>had in mind.  Indeed, the government and the Norwegian </p><p>facilitators have noted that the GSL and the Tigers might </p><p>take "years" to reach substantive agreement on what a final </p><p>settlement might look like.  That is much too long.  The </p><p>government should tell the country by "mid-year next year </p><p>(2003)" precisely what it has in mind, Kadirgamar asserted. </p><p>If the government fails to do this, the President will be </p><p>forced to make an issue of it, he averred.  DAS Camp </p><p>underscored the USG\'s strong support for peace process.  It </p><p>was vital that the PM and the President work together in the </p><p>national interest, DAS Camp stressed.  Ambassador Wills </p><p>emphasized that Sri Lanka had a "once in a generation chance </p><p>for peace" and it was important that this opportunity not be </p><p>squandered due to political infighting. </p><p> </p><p>15. (C) In response to a query on how cohabitation was </p><p>working, Kadirgamar replied that President Kumaratunga </p><p>accepted the current situation and had made clear she was </p><p>willing to reach out to the government in her October 24 </p><p>speech.  Cohabitation was here to stay in Sri Lanka just as </p><p>it was a permanent feature of politics in some European </p><p>countries, and both parties had to get used to that fact. </p><p>The President had no intention of calling elections and the </p><p>government should accept that, Kadirgamar stated.  Kadirgamar </p><p>went on to note that a good model for future cohabitation </p><p>cooperation was the semi-regular schedule of meetings the two </p><p>sides had agreed to on peace process and national security </p><p>issues (see ref C).  Wrapping up, Kadirgamar related that the </p><p>government had to understand that any agreements it reached </p><p>with the Tamil Tigers would be subject to parliamentary </p><p>approval and perhaps even a referendum.  It would be best if </p><p>it worked with the President and her party now on these </p><p>issues, and not surprise them with the unexpected, he noted. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>16. (C) DAS Camp\'s visit reinforced the message of U.S. </p><p>support for the peace process delivered earlier by Deputy </p><p>Secretary Armitage (in August) and SA A/S Rocca (in March). </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>The GSL and the opposition also heard clearly his message </p><p>that the U.S. does not want to see the peace process derailed </p><p>by internal politics.  Fortunately the peace process appears </p><p>to be gaining strength, in spite of cohabitation tensions and </p><p>strains within the government coalition. </p><p> </p><p>17. (C) The GSL remains committed at the political level to </p><p>signing an Article 98 agreement, and DAS Camp\'s visit did </p><p>much to help push this forward.  Winning over the bureaucrats </p><p>at the MFA, especially the lawyers, will take additional </p><p>work.  Post is confident that GSL will sign the kind of </p><p>Article 98 agreement that we want; we are working to ensure </p><p>that happens sooner rather than later. </p><p> </p><p>18. (U) DAS Camp did not have the opportunity to clear this </p><p>message prior to departing Colombo. </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
