<p>UNCLAS ZAGREB 001553 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR AC/CAC (JYOUNG), EUR/AGS AND EUR/SCE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PARM, PREL, MARR, HR </p><p>SUBJECT: RACVIAC: CROATIA ASKS U.S. TO REMAIN IN ADVISORY </p><p>GROUP </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 168583 </p><p>     B. BERLIN 2394 </p><p></p><p>1.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  CROATIA BELIEVES THE U.S. IS </p><p>UNDERESTIMATING THE VALUE OF RACVIAC AS A TOOL FOR DEVELOPING </p><p>REGIONAL STABILITY AND ASKS THAT WE RECONSIDER THE CENTER\'S </p><p>BENEFITS BEFORE REDUCING OUR ENGAGEMENT IN THE ADVISORY </p><p>GROUP.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) ON JUNE 18, WE DELIVERED REF A TALKING POINTS TO </p><p>VICE SKRACIC, HEAD OF THE MFA\'S INTERNATIONAL SECURITY </p><p>DEPARTMENT.  DUE TO ONGOING REORGANIZATION OF THE MFA, </p><p>SKRACIC PROVIDED A DEFINITIVE RESPONSE TO OUR POSITION ONLY </p><p>ON JULY 2.  SKRACIC ASKED THAT WE CONSIDER CAREFULLY BEFORE </p><p>DISENGAGING FROM THE MULTINATIONAL ADVISORY GROUP (MAG). </p><p>DESPITE WHAT COULD APPEAR TO BE A PROLIFERATION OF REGIONAL </p><p>ARMS CONTROL "TALK SHOPS," RACVIAC PROVIDES UNIQUE VALUE, HE </p><p>ARGUED.  ACCORDING TO SKRACIC, RACVIAC IS INCREASINGLY USEFUL </p><p>AS A VENUE TO PROVIDE TRAINING TO WORKING-LEVEL OFFICIALS ON </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION OF COMPLEX REGIONAL ARMS CONTROL ARRANGEMENTS. </p><p> HE CLAIMED RACVIAC IS RELATIVELY EASY TO GET TO AND </p><p>INEXPENSIVE.  SKRACIC DECLARED THAT RACVIAC HAS NO PRETENSION </p><p>TO BE ANYTHING OTHER THAN A LEARNING CENTER; ITS EFFORTS TO </p><p>FORM RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE SOUTHEASTERN EUROPE CLEARINGHOUSE </p><p>FOR THE CONTROL OF SMALL ARMS AND LIGHT WEAPONS (SEESAC) AND </p><p>THE SHAPE SCHOOL AT OBERAMMERGAU ARE ATTEMPTS TO MAKE BETTER </p><p>USE OF THE FACILITIES IN CROATIA. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) SKRACIC AGREED THAT THE PROPOSED BUDGET OF 900,000 </p><p>EURO IS HIGH, BUT POINTED OUT THAT TWO-THIRDS OF THAT AMOUNT </p><p>HAVE ALREADY BEEN PLEDGED BY FRANCE AND GERMANY.  HE </p><p>SUGGESTED THAT EVEN IF THE U.S. CHOOSE NOT TO CONTRIBUTE </p><p>FINANCIALLY, IT SHOULD CONSIDER REMAINING IN RACVIAC\'S </p><p>    MULTINATIONAL ADVISORY GROUP.  THE LOSS OF U.S. PARTICIPATION </p><p>WOULD BE A BLOW TO THE ORGANIZATION\'S CREDIBILITY, SAID </p><p>SKRACIC. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) OUR ABILITY TO SHAPE RACVIAC\'S AGENDA HAS BEEN </p><p>LIMITED.  IF WE REMAINED IN THE MAG WITHOUT CONTRIBUTING TO </p><p>RACVIAC\'S BUDGET, WE WOULD HAVE EVEN LESS LEVERAGE THAN WE DO </p><p>NOW.  WHILE SKRACIC IS PROBABLY CORRECT THAT THE RACVIAC WILL </p><p>LOSE CREDIBILITY WITHOUT OUR ENGAGEMENT, WE AGREE WITH </p><p>EMBASSY BERLIN\'S CONCLUSION (REF B) THAT A CAREFUL, CORDIAL </p><p>FAREWELL TO THE MAG WITH NO RECRIMINATIONS WOULD BEST SERVE </p><p>OUR INTERESTS IN THE REGION. </p><p>FRANK </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p></p></div>
