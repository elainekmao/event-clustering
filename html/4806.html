<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 HANOI 003037 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, ECON, VM, DPOL </p><p>SUBJECT:  WRAP-UP OF THE 11TH NATIONAL ASSEMBLY 2ND SESSION </p><p> </p><p>REF:  HANOI 1780 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  SUMMARY.  THE 11TH NATIONAL ASSEMBLY (NA) CONCLUDED </p><p>ITS SECOND SESSION ON DECEMBER 16, HAVING BEGUN ITS USUAL </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  03037  01 OF 03  200759Z </p><p>YEAR-END MEETING ON NOVEMBER 12.  NA DELEGATES REVIEWED </p><p>REPORTS OF THE GOVERNMENT ON SOCIO-ECONOMIC SITUATION IN </p><p>2002, SET TARGETS FOR 2003, AND DISCUSSED AND PASSED SEVERAL </p><p>LAWS AND LEGAL DOCUMENTS, NAMELY THE LAW ON PROMULGATION OF </p><p>LEGAL DOCUMENTS, AND THE LAW ON THE STATE BUDGET.  DELEGATES </p><p>QUESTIONED SELECTED CABINET MEMBERS DURING A THREE-DAY </p><p>QUESTION-AND-ANSWER SESSION, ALTHOUGH THERE WERE COMPLAINTS </p><p>ABOUT THE LIMITED TIME AND THE LACK OF OPPORTUNITY TO QUERY </p><p>THE NEW MINISTER OF PUBLIC SECURITY.  THE NA AT LAST </p><p>APPROVED A RESOLUTION FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE </p><p>CONTROVERSIAL SON LA HYDROELECTRIC PLANT, WHILE PRIVATELY </p><p>CONTINUING TO EXPRESS SOME RESERVATIONS.  RELATIONS WITH THE </p><p>U.S. CAME UNDER BRIEF SCRUTINY, ALTHOUGH THE OVERALL </p><p>ASSESSMENT APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN POSITIVE.  OVER 100 "FULL- </p><p>TIME" NA DELEGATES HAVE NOW BEEN APPOINTED AND SHOULD BEGIN </p><p>WORK AT THE CENTRAL AND LOCAL LEVELS SOON.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>SOCIO-ECONOMIC SITUATION </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  DURING THE ANNUAL DISCUSSION ON THE GVN REPORT ON </p><p>SOCIO-ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS, SOME DELEGATES VOICED </p><p>DISSATISFACTION THAT THE GVN HAD FAILED TO PRESENT EFFECTIVE </p><p>MEASURES TO SOLVE MANY KEY PROBLEMS, IN PARTICULAR </p><p>WIDESPREAD OFFICIAL CORRUPTION AND WASTE, HIGH RATES OF </p><p>UNEMPLOYMENT, AND INADEQUATE ADMINISTRATIVE REFORM. </p><p>DELEGATES NONETHELESS PASSED THE RESOLUTION PROPOSED BY THE </p><p>GVN WITH THE FOLLOWING MAIN GOALS, INTER ALIA, FOR 2003: </p><p>--  GDP GROWTH BY 7-7.5 PCT </p><p>--  EXPORT VALUE UP BY 7.5-8 PCT </p><p>--  TOTAL INVESTMENT TO ACCOUNT FOR 35 PCT OF GDP </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  03037  01 OF 03  200759Z </p><p>--  1.5 MILLION NEW JOBS </p><p>--  JOB TRAINING FOR OVER 1 MILLION PEOPLE </p><p>--  HOUSEHOLDS UNDER THE POVERTY LEVEL DECLINE TO 12.5 PCT </p><p>--  MALNOURISHED CHILDREN REDUCED TO 28 PCT </p><p>--  BIRTH RATE REDUCTION OF 0.04 PCT </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  THE NA, AS EXPECTED, PASSED THE 2003 BUDGET, IN </p><p>WHICH EDUCATION STILL RECEIVES THE LARGEST SHARE, AND ALSO </p><p>AMENDED BUDGETARY RESPONSIBILITIES TO GIVE MORE AUTHORITY TO </p><p>LOCALITIES. </p><p> </p><p>LEGISLATION </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  THE NA PASSED A LAW ON AMENDMENTS AND CHANGES TO </p><p>THE LAW ON PROMULGATION OF LEGAL DOCUMENTS (ALSO REFERRED TO </p><p>AS THE LAW ON LAWS), REGULATIONS ON SESSIONS OF THE NATIONAL </p><p>ASSEMBLY, REGULATIONS ON NATIONAL ASSEMBLY DELEGATES AND </p><p>PROVINCIAL PARLIAMENTARIAN DELEGATIONS. DELEGATES ALSO </p><p>DISCUSSED AND COMMENTED ON SEVERAL DRAFT LAWS, INCLUDING THE </p><p>LAW ON THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY\'S SUPERVISORY ACTIVITIES AND </p><p>THE LAW ON NATIONAL BOUNDARIES.  THE NA ADOPTED A RESOLUTION </p><p>ON ITS 2003-2007 WORKPLAN TO DRAFT AND PASS 137 LAWS, </p><p>ORDINANCES, AND RESOLUTIONS.  (COMMENT:  IT IS UNCLEAR </p><p>WHETHER THIS REFERS TO SPECIFIC LEGISLATION ALREADY IN THE </p><p>WORKS OR NOT.  IT IS, AT BEST, A MODEST WORKPLAN GIVEN THE </p><p>LEGAL CHALLENGES FACING THE GVN OVER THIS DECADE.  END </p><p>COMMENT) </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  NA DELEGATES TURNED DOWN ONE OF THE MOST </p><p>CONTROVERSIAL PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO THE LAW ON LAWS.  THE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  03037  01 OF 03  200759Z </p><p>GVN HAD PROPOSED THAT INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS SHOULD </p><p>PREVAIL IN CASES IN WHICH THEY CONFLICTED WITH DOMESTIC </p><p>LAWS.  (NOTE: THIS WAS A DIRECT ATTEMPT TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE </p><p>OF CONFORMITY WITH THE BTA AND EVENTUALLY, THE WTO </p><p>AGREEMENTS, WITHOUT HAVING TO GO BACK AND CHANGE UPWARDS OF </p><p>200 LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT WILL CONFLICT.  END NOTE)  THE </p><p>DELEGATES DECLINED TO APPROVE THE CHANGE, CITING </p><p>"SOVEREIGNTY" REASONS.  JUSTICE MINISTER UONG CHU LUU, ON </p><p>BEHALF OF THE GVN, INFORMED THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY THAT THE </p><p>ITEM WOULD BE RE-WRITTEN IN A NEWER VERSION OF THE LAW.  IN </p><p>ANOTHER MOVE, DELEGATES ALSO VOTED TO AMEND EXISTING GVN LAW </p><p>SO AS TO REQUIRE THAT ALL LAWS BECOME EFFECTIVE ONLY AFTER </p><p>PUBLICIZED IN THE PUBLIC GAZETTE (ANOTHER BTA REQUIREMENT ON </p><p>TRANSPARENCY).  THERE WAS SOME OPPOSITION TO THIS MOVE; SOME </p><p>DELEGATES DECLARED IT WAS "IRRATIONAL" AND OTHERS CLAIMED </p><p>THE CHANGE WAS TOO VAGUE AND PREFERRED TO HAVE EACH LEGAL </p><p>DOCUMENT SPECIFY EFFECTIVE DATES. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  NA DELEGATES ALSO VOTED TO ESTABLISH AN AD-HOC </p><p>COMMITTEE TO EXAMINE MORE CAREFULLY THE DRAFT LAW RELATED TO </p><p>ITS OWN SUPERVISORY AND INSPECTION ACTIVITIES.  THE NEW BODY </p><p>WILL BE HEADED BY A MEMBER OF THE NA STANDING COMMITTEE, </p><p>WILL INCLUDE 25 MEMBERS, AND WILL ALSO SEEK INPUT FROM </p><p>EXPERTS INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE NA.  ACCORDING TO A SENIOR </p><p>STAFF MEMBER FROM THE OFFICE OF THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY (ONA), </p><p>THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THIS AD-HOC COMMITTEE IS </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ5631 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HANOI  03037  02 OF 03  200759Z </p><p>ACTION EAP-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00  COME-00  CTME-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  DOEE-00  ITCE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00 </p><p>      EXME-00  OIGO-00  E-00     FAAE-00  FBIE-00  UTED-00  VC-00 </p><p>      FRB-00   H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    ITC-01   LAB-01 </p><p>      L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OMB-01   OPIC-01 </p><p>      PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    SSO-00 </p><p>      STR-00   TEST-00  TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00 </p><p>      DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /009W </p><p>                  ------------------1AADF7  200800Z /38 </p><p>R 200716Z DEC 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HANOI </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 8432 </p><p>INFO AMCONSUL HO CHI MINH CITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY PHNOM PENH </p><p>AMEMBASSY VIENTIANE </p><p>USCINCPAC HONOLULU HI </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 03 HANOI 003037 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"UNPRECEDENTED" AND IS SEEN AS A SIGN OF THE NA\'S GROWING </p><p>ASSERTIVENESS. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  SEVERAL DELEGATES DURING THE SESSION EXPRESSED </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  03037  02 OF 03  200759Z </p><p>FRUSTRATION OVER WHAT THEY PERCEIVED AS AUTHORITARIAN </p><p>BEHAVIOR BY SOME AMONG THE NA LEADERSHIP WHEN DELIBERATING </p><p>ON DRAFT LEGISLATION DURING PLENARY SESSIONS.  IN TRYING TO </p><p>PERSUADE DELEGATES TO ACCEPT THE GVN DRAFTS, THESE LEADERS </p><p>APPEARED TO DAMPEN OPPORTUNITIES FOR DELEGATES TO HAVE FRANK </p><p>AND OPEN DISCUSSIONS ON SOME OF THE MORE CONTROVERSIAL </p><p>ISSUES.   NA CHAIRMAN NGUYEN VAN AN AT SEVERAL TIMES DURING </p><p>THE PLENARY SESSIONS APPARENTLY HAD TO BEG THE PARDON OF THE </p><p>DELEGATES IN RESPONSE TO THEIR DISCONTENT. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U)  ADDITIONALLY, SOME DELEGATES WERE REPORTEDLY UPSET </p><p>THAT THEIR "RATIONAL" COMMENTS WERE NOT REFLECTED IN FINAL </p><p>LEGISLATION.  THERE WERE APPARENTLY OPEN ARGUMENTS BETWEEN </p><p>SOME DELEGATES AND CABINET MINISTERS (WHO REPRESENTED </p><p>CHAIRMEN OF THE DRAFTING UNITS) DURING PLENARY MEETINGS OF </p><p>THE NA.  DELEGATE NGUYEN DINH LOC, THE MINISTER OF JUSTICE </p><p>UNTIL AUGUST 2002, AT ONE POINT PUBLICLY CALLED UPON </p><p>MINISTER OF FINANCE NGUYEN SINH HUNG "TO LISTEN TO RIGHT </p><p>COMMENTS FROM THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY" AFTER HUNG DECLINED TO </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGE POINTS RAISED BY DELEGATES ABOUT THE REVISED LAW </p><p>ON STATE BUDGET. </p><p> </p><p>QS-AND-AS WITH CABINET MEMBERS </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U)  TO THE DISAPPOINTMENT OF MANY DELEGATES, MINISTER </p><p>OF PUBLIC SECURITY LE HONG ANH WAS NOT ONE AMONG THE FEW </p><p>CABINET MINISTERS TO ATTEND THE 3-DAY Q&A SESSION, WHICH WAS </p><p>CARRIED LIVE ON NATIONAL TELEVISION.  SOME DELEGATES SAID </p><p>THAT ANH SHOULD BE OBLIGED TO RESPOND TO COMPLAINTS THAT THE </p><p>MPS HAD FAILED EFFECTIVELY TO DEAL WITH THE NAM CAM MAFIA </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  03037  02 OF 03  200759Z </p><p>GANG AND THE ALLEGED INVOLVEMENTS OF MPS OFFICIALS </p><p>(INCLUDING TWO MPS MINISTERS WHO LOST THEIR POSITIONS AND </p><p>WERE ALSO DEMOTED IN RANK). </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U)  SEVERAL OBSERVERS NOTED THAT THE Q&A SESSION </p><p>APPEARED MORE STAGED THAN IN PREVIOUS YEARS, WITH MINISTERS </p><p>USING THEIR ALLOCATED TIME MERELY TO READ PREPARED REMARKS, </p><p>LEAVING LITTLE TIME FOR DISCUSSION.  SOME DELEGATES HAVE </p><p>COMPLAINED THAT THE TIME ALLOCATED FOR THE Q&A SESSION WAS </p><p>TOO SHORT OVERALL.  PUBLIC INTEREST IN THE LIVE COVERAGE </p><p>APPEARED MINIMAL. </p><p> </p><p>SON LA DAM-- AT LAST! </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.

ESTIMATED COSTS WERE PROJECTED AT </p><p>BETWEEN USD 2-2.5 BILLION, WITH THE GVN CLAIMING 70 PCT WILL </p><p>BE FINANCED DOMESTICALLY.  AFTER THE VOTE, ONE NA DELEGATE </p><p>TOLD POL/C THAT NA DELEGATES NOW WERE "MORE SATISFIED, BUT </p><p>NOT SATISFIED" WITH THE COMPROMISE PROJECT.

(U)  FOREIGN MINISTER NGUYEN DY NIEN ON DECEMBER 4 GAVE </p><p>A BROAD OVERVIEW OF THE GVN\'S SUCCESSES IN THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>ARENA OVER THE PAST YEAR, BUT LOCAL MEDIA MERELY SUMMARIZED </p><p>HIS REMARKS BRIEFLY.  ONA CONTACTS DECLINED TO PROVIDE </p><p>EMBASSY A COPY OF HIS REPORT.  ACCORDING TO ONE NA DELEGATE, </p><p>FM NIEN PRAISED POSITIVE DEVELOPMENTS IN US-VIETNAM </p><p>RELATIONS, BUT NOTED SOME "NEGATIVE" INFLUENCES.  ANOTHER NA </p><p>DELEGATE SEPARATELY SAID THAT HE HAD INFERRED FROM FM NIEN\'S </p><p>COMMENTS ABOUT THE U.S. THAT THERE WERE "NEGATIVE FORCES" IN </p><p>THE U.S. TRYING TO INFLUENCE US POLICYMAKERS, BUT THAT THE </p><p>USG ITSELF MAINTAINED A CONSTRUCTIVE POLICY TOWARD VIETNAM </p><p>AND BOTH GOVERNMENTS WERE CONTINUING TO IMPROVE AND EXPAND </p><p>RELATIONS REGARDLESS. </p><p> </p><p>STAFFING </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>13.
