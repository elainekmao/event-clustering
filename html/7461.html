(U) This message is sensitive, but unclassified. </p><p>Please treat accordingly. </p><p> </p><p>2.   (U) SUMMARY:  Canada is clearly shifting its policy on </p><p>telecommunications competition toward a more pro-competitive </p><p>model. </p><p> </p><p>-- Following extensive public hearings, in late April a key </p><p>Parliamentary committee is expected to call for a sweeping </p><p>re-examination of the GOC\'s foreign ownership restrictions </p><p>in communications industries. </p><p> </p><p>-- During March the Minister of Industry called on the GOC\'s </p><p>telecom regulator to promote greater competition in local </p><p>phone service.  Accordingly, on April 10 the regulator </p><p>issued a public notice saying that major incumbent telcos </p><p>had broken various regulations in a pattern of anti- </p><p>competitive conduct, and that it will undertake spot </p><p>inspections to uncover and prosecute such behavior. </p><p>END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>3.   (U) BACKGROUND:  Canada\'s communications regulatory </p><p>agency is the Canadian Radio-Television and </p><p>Telecommunications Commission (CRTC).  The GOC\'s Departments </p><p>of Industry (for telecoms) and Canadian Heritage (for </p><p>broadcasting) determine policy.  In telecoms, the shift from </p><p>monopoly to competition began in the early 1990\'s, but </p><p>progress slowed after a few years: the major incumbent firms </p><p>retained dominant market shares, and newer entrants had </p><p>difficulty becoming profitable.  The latter complained in </p><p>particular of two barriers to competition:  (1) restrictions </p><p>on the degree of foreign ownership of telecom carriers, and </p><p>(2) the level of "contributions" which new entrants had to </p><p>pay to incumbents for the use of their facilities. </p><p> </p><p>4.   (SBU) In January 2002, Charles Dalfen became Chairman </p><p>of the CRTC.  Observers have been consistently positive </p><p>about the prospects for a more pro-competitive regulatory </p><p>regime under Dalfen\'s leadership.  On May 30, 2002, in a </p><p>decision that made both sides about equally unhappy, the </p><p>CRTC set out ground rules for competition in local telephone </p><p>service (ref B).  Since then, observers say, CRTC </p><p>decisionmaking on telecoms has begun to move more quickly </p><p>and has shown signs of becoming more favorable to smaller </p><p>competitors. </p><p> </p><p>5.   (U) OWNERSHIP RESTRICTIONS:  Foreign ownership of </p><p>telecom carriers in Canada is restricted to direct ownership </p><p>of no more than 20 percent of voting shares, and no more </p><p>than one-third of indirect ownership, effectively limiting </p><p>foreign ownership to a maximum of 46.7 percent of any </p><p>carrier.  U.S.-based telecom interests pressed the GOC in </p><p>1999-2001 to review these restrictions, without immediate </p><p>success. </p><p> </p><p>6.   (SBU) In late 2002 Industry Minister Allan Rock asked </p><p>the House of Commons Committee on Industry to examine this </p><p>issue (ref A).  Having held extensive hearings, the </p><p>Committee will release its report on April 28.  According to </p><p>press reports and contacts, the report will take a favorable </p><p>view of relaxing the restrictions.  In light of the </p><p>inextricable competitive links between telecommunications </p><p>and other media which are outside the Committee\'s (and </p><p>Minister Rock\'s) mandate, the report will advise the GOC to </p><p>hold a broader review covering ownership restrictions </p><p>affecting all these industries. </p><p> </p><p>6.   (U) LOCAL SERVICE COMPETITION: In a speech on March 26, </p><p>Minister Rock said that the GOC "expects that the CRTC will </p><p>continue to show its commitment to maintaining pro- </p><p>competition momentum . . .  (L)ocal competition is virtually </p><p>non-existent in all but our largest cities. We would like to </p><p>see the CRTC consider what additional measures it can take </p><p>to promote competition . . . the Government of Canada will </p><p>closely monitor the evolution of competition to ensure that </p><p>it does not deteriorate." </p><p> </p><p>7.   (U) On April 10, the CRTC issued a public notice on </p><p>regulatory compliance (no. 2003-4 at crtc.gc.ca) which </p><p>listed a variety of known infractions of tariffs, rules </p><p>and/or legislation by incumbent telecom firms.  Suggesting </p><p>that a complaints-based enforcement system had not been </p><p>adequate, the CRTC announced that it would designate </p><p>inspectors to verify compliance by conducting unannounced </p><p>inspections of these firms, which could begin anytime after </p><p>June 19, 2003. </p><p> </p><p>8.   (SBU) COMMENT:  While industry observers and </p><p>competitive firms received this announcement favorably, the </p><p>extent to which the CRTC will follow through remains to be </p><p>seen.  A spokesperson for the largest incumbent, Bell </p><p>Canada, was quoted arguing that determinations of past </p><p>"infractions" had been based on "erroneous" information from </p><p>competitors, and that it would be more accurate to say that </p><p>the CRTC and incumbent firms are in "disagreement" over </p><p>"complex and arcane" rules.  Skeptics would note that the </p><p>large incumbents have been perennially effective at winning </p><p>the "regulatory affairs game" vis--vis smaller firms, </p><p>mainly by casting themselves as instruments of public </p><p>policy.  In post\'s view, while Minister Rock\'s call for </p><p>greater competition provided a short-term push, progress </p><p>depends on the appetite of CRTC Chairman Dalfen for </p><p>substantial change.  Higher-level GOC policies, including </p><p>the foreign ownership issue, will likely be hostage to the </p><p>coming Liberal Party leadership transition and subsequent </p><p>election, which will distract GOC ministers until sometime </p><p>in 2004. </p><p> </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
