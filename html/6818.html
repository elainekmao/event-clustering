<p>UNCLAS OTTAWA 000869 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR WHA/CAN (Running) OES/ENV (Matuzak) IO </p><p>(Turak) </p><p> </p><p>GENEVA for Poulton </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: SENV, EAID, EU, IO, KSCA, AORC, CA </p><p>SUBJECT: CANADIAN VIEWS ON UNECE EFE MINISTERIAL </p><p> </p><p>REF: SECSTATE 75080 </p><p> </p><p>1. EST Counselor and EST Specialist made the demarche </p><p>requested in reftel to Jean-Louis Wallace of the </p><p>Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade </p><p>(DFAIT).  According to Wallace, Canada shares USG </p><p>concerns about the draft Environment for Europe </p><p>ministerial declaration.  Wallace indicated that he and </p><p>others in GoC had been dismayed as the draft </p><p>declaration expanded in scope.  Like the U.S., Canada </p><p>would like to see the declaration deal primarily with </p><p>issues that have broad consensus within the ECE and </p><p>less with issues that only have limited support or that </p><p>apply only to specific UNECE sub-regions. </p><p> </p><p>2. Our discussion with Wallace revealed that Canada </p><p>shares nearly every point of U.S. concern noted in </p><p>reftel.  Wallace told EST Counselor and EST Specialist </p><p>that there would be an interagency meeting, including </p><p>DFAIT and Environment Canada, in Ottawa this week at </p><p>which he would bring our demarche up for discussion, </p><p>and he intended to circulate USG talking points to his </p><p>interagency colleagues prior to the meeting to </p><p>facilitate further coordination.  Wallace also told us </p><p>he would be very willing to participate in a conference </p><p>call with U.S. counterparts in the run-up to UNECE </p><p>meetings to coordinate positions. </p><p> </p><p>Cellucci </p><p></p></div>
