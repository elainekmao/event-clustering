<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 004544 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/18/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKISH GENERAL STAFF OBJECTS TO EU REFORM PACKAGE </p><p>AIMED AT RESTRICTING MILITARY\'S POLITICAL POWER </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ANKARA 4319 </p><p>     B. ANKARA 4367 </p><p>     C. ANKARA 4499 </p><p>     D. ANKARA 2521 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by DCM Robert S. Deutsch.  Reason: 1.5 (b)(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) CNN Turk and NTV news channels report July 18 that the </p><p>Turkish General Staff (TGS) leadership has voiced objections </p><p>to the AK Government about its latest EU-related reform </p><p>package.  According to the reports, TGS opposes the reforms </p><p>because: 1) they "restrict the jurisdiction of the National </p><p>Security Council;" 2) the package would bring the military\'s </p><p>budget under civilian (Court of Accounts) control; and 3) the </p><p>proposals foresee holding NSC meetings every other month, </p><p>vice the current monthly schedule. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>Commentary </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) In a telephone conversation with us after the news </p><p>broke, AK Vice Chairman Firat was sparse in his comments, </p><p>noting, however, that "we (the Government) are under pressure </p><p>on a number of issues."  In a recent, more private </p><p>conversation reported ref A, Firat noted that TGS is </p><p>attempting to use the controversy surrounding the July 4 </p><p>brief detention of Turkish Special Forces (TSF) by U.S. </p><p>troops in Iraq to fan nationalist flames and undercut the </p><p>reform drive.  Firat indicated that TGS Chief Ozkok is facing </p><p>severe pressure from more hawkish elements in the military </p><p>leadership who are trying to make it difficult for Ozkok to </p><p>unseat them. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) In a meeting with Polmilcouns July 16, Air Force Maj. </p><p>Gen. Suphi Acar (J-5/Chief of Agreements), confirmed that the </p><p>hard-line/soft-line split within the military is more </p><p>pronounced since the July 4 detention of the TSF.  Moreover, </p><p>hard-liners long concerned about Ozkok\'s "accommodationist" </p><p>stance vis-a-vis AK and P.M. Erdogan are even more agitated </p><p>since the July 4 incident.  Acar noted that he counts himself </p><p>among those that feel that AK\'s true agenda is an eventual </p><p>Islamic state (a view echoed to Polmilcouns July 15 by Air </p><p>Force Lt. Gen. Turgut, Acar\'s boss and TGS Plans/Policy </p><p>Chief).  Ozkok, Acar said, must take a tougher line on AK\'s </p><p>attempts to diminish the role of the military in the MGK and </p><p>to take control of military spending.   Similarly, given the </p><p>widespread view of USG "support" for AK, many flag officers </p><p>want Ozkok to take a more aggressive line with the Americans, </p><p>too, and feel he capitulated on the Joint Statement.  Acar </p><p>agreed that the premier hard-liners are Army officers:  TGS </p><p>Deputy Chief Gen. Buyukanit and Army Gen. Yalman, NSC SecGen </p><p>Gen. Kilinc, Aegean Army Chief Gen. Tolon, and Lt. Gen. </p><p>Karabay (J-3/Ops Chief). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Cuneyt Ulsever, an influential columnist at the daily </p><p>"Hurriyet," told us July 18 that the NSC issue represents a </p><p>crucial test of AK and of Turkey\'s ability to continue the </p><p>reform process.  He noted that the military is particularly </p><p>concerned with maintaining the NSC\'s ability to impose </p><p>discipline on the civilians.  The NSC SecGen oversees </p><p>directly and indirectly hundreds of staffers -- including the </p><p>ASAM think tank headed by Umit Ozdag, who Ulsever asserted is </p><p>on the TGS payroll (note: which we have heard from numerous </p><p>other commentators -- septel).  "I know" for a fact, he </p><p>asserted, that Ozkok himself is not/not driving the </p><p>opposition to the reforms.  Ulsever also noted that the </p><p>opposition CHP is reversing course and opposing further </p><p>reform.  He related how CHP Deputy Kemal Dervis, one of the </p><p>party\'s more reform-minded members, is now trying to convince </p><p>journalists that AK "is seeking a Sharia state" even though </p><p>Dervis knows better.  (Note: in a July 16 meeting with us, </p><p>Dervis expressed slight "reservations" about AK even as he </p><p>applauded AK\'s reform push.  end note.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>What Will AK Do? </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (S) Maj. Gen. Acar asserted that, facing pressure from </p><p>within the military, Ozkok will insist, via his working </p><p>relationship with Erdogan, on diluting these measures to the </p><p>point that the military hard-liners would be satisfied.  Acar </p><p>expressed confidence that Ozkok would prevail, but admitted </p><p>that should AK decline to back down, the TGS Chief would face </p><p>"unbearable" pressure. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Ulsever added that it would be "political suicide" for </p><p>AK to take a step back now, given that it has extended </p><p>Parliament\'s current session precisely to enact these reforms </p><p>and to demonstrate to an overwhelmingly pro-reform public its </p><p>seriousness of purpose.  Dropping the reforms would also </p><p>potentially wreak havoc with the GOT\'s EU timetable, and </p><p>negatively effect the EU\'s report on Turkey due out this </p><p>fall.  Turkey\'s EU candidacy, Ulsever averred, depends on </p><p>what AK does right now. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) In the interest of helping Ozkok manage relations with </p><p>his hard-liners, AK is showing signs of back-tracking on key </p><p>reform proposals.  As recently as July 11, F.M. Gul assured </p><p>Ambassador that the Government is committed to transforming </p><p>the NSC into a "real" advisory vice governing body (ref B). </p><p>However, we note AK\'s willingness to temporize to limit the </p><p>extent of confrontation.  Recently they: 1) weakened a </p><p>comprehensive "reintegration" proposal intended to bring </p><p>PKK/KADEK militants down from the mountains (ref C); 2) </p><p>shelved controversial higher education reform bills (septel); </p><p>and 3) have shaded toward a more nationalist line on the July </p><p>4 incident.  AK\'s approach could represent a tactical </p><p>decision to wait for the outcome of the Aug 1-4 meeting of </p><p>the Supreme Military Council (YAS), in the hope that Ozkok </p><p>will have the wherewithal to ease out some of the military </p><p>hard-liners.  However, as so often in Turkey, biding one\'s </p><p>time becomes an end in itself (ref D), and might have </p><p>profound implications for Turkey\'s immediate and EU-related </p><p>future. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
