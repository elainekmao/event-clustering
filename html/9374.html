<p>UNCLAS TEGUCIGALPA 001655 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR CI/OCS/WHA, CA/OCS/ACS AND WHA/CEN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: CASC, HO </p><p>SUBJECT: CONSULAR MEETING WITH HONDURAN CENTRAL AUTHORITY </p><p>ON HAGUE CONVENTION ON INTERNATIONAL CHILD ABDUCTION </p><p>CASES </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. SUMMARY: On July 10, 2003, Deputy Consul General and </p><p>LES Consular Specialist met with the Interim Director of </p><p>the Instituto Hondureno de la Ninez y la Familia (IHNFA), </p><p>Attorney Luis Erasmo Elvir.  The IHNFA is the Designated </p><p>Central Authority in Honduras for the Hague Convention on </p><p>International Child Abduction. Consular reps presented </p><p>IHNFA Director with a new Hague application and much to </p><p>our dismay the IHNFA stated that the Hague Convention on </p><p>Child Abduction could not be applied in Honduras because </p><p>the GOH had not yet ratified the convention. END OF </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. On July 9, 2003, Post learned that IHNFA\'s Director, </p><p>Attorney Maria Elena de Carbajal had resigned and that </p><p>Attorney Luis Erasmo Elvir was currently Acting Interim </p><p>Director.  We made an appointment with Attorney Elvin to </p><p>submit a new application under the Hague for the return </p><p>of Amcit Kevin Obed Berrios.  On July 11, 2003 at 2:00 </p><p>p.m., Deputy Consul General and LES Consular Specialist </p><p>met with the Interim Director, Attorney Erasmo Elvir, and </p><p>his legal assessors, Attorney Melissa Calix and Attorney </p><p>Alba Cecilia Mena de Beln.  As we were submitting the </p><p>Obed Berrios application, we were informed that the Hague </p><p>Convention on Child Abduction could not be applied in </p><p>Honduras because the GOH had not yet ratified the </p><p>convention.  We were surprised to hear this from the </p><p>IHNFA reps, since we had raised this issue with them back </p><p>in July 27, 1998, and were under the impression that they </p><p>understood the mechanics of the Hague Convention. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Once again, Consular reps explained that the </p><p>applicability issue was settled in July 2001 when </p><p>Ambassador Policarpo Callejas, Ministry of Foreign </p><p>Affairs Advisor, confirmed that since both Honduras and </p><p>the USA are signatories to the Vienna Convention, the </p><p>Hague Convention International Child Abduction is in </p><p>force between the two countries.  The Vienna Convention </p><p>Article 27 states that a country may not invoke the </p><p>provisions of its internal law (ratification requirement) </p><p>as justification for its failure to implement specific </p><p>provisions of a treaty. </p><p> </p><p>4. The IHNFA reps provided us with a copy of a letter </p><p>dated May 30, 2003 addressed to the President of the </p><p>Honduran Congress, Porfiro Lobo, in which they requested </p><p>that Congress define the applicability of the Hague </p><p>Convention in Honduras.  Consular reps agreed to provide </p><p>IHNFA with copies of all the documentation we have </p><p>indicating that this issue has already been resolved.  We </p><p>will also send, via appropriate Embassy channels, a </p><p>letter to Mr. Lobo, with the same documentation, </p><p>requesting a prompt response to IHNFA\'s original inquiry. </p><p>It would appear that IHNFA is unwilling to apply the </p><p>Hague without the expressed permission of the Honduran </p><p>Congress, even though that permission is not required. </p><p>Post will continue to actively pursue resolution of this </p><p>matter, as we will continue to receive Hague applications </p><p>and we wish to see them processed without undue delay by </p><p>the GOH.  Post will advise the Department of any new </p><p>developments as they become available. </p><p> </p><p>PALMER </p><p></p></div>
