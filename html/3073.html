<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 002941 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>TREASURY FOR PIPATANAGUL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/05/2012 </p><p>TAGS: ETTC, ENRG, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDAN-IRAQ OIL PIPELINE UPDATE </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. AMMAN 185 </p><p>     B. 01 AMMAN 4049 </p><p>     C. AMMAN 1782 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMBASSADOR EDWARD W. GNEHM, REASONS 1.5 (B,D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (c)  Summary:  The GOJ recently extended the deadline for </p><p>final bids on a proposed crude oil pipeline connecting oil </p><p>fields near Baghdad to the Zarqa refinery.  The proposed </p><p>100,000 bpd pipeline (which equals Jordan\'s current oil </p><p>consumption) would be expandable to 150,000 bpd once the </p><p>Zarqa refinery is upgraded to handle the capacity.  While the </p><p>GOJ wants the project to move forward for cost-saving </p><p>reasons, investors are showing caution in finalizing bids for </p><p>the program given the uncertainties arising from Iraq </p><p>sanctions issues.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (u)  The Jordan Times reported on May 27 that the GOJ had </p><p>extended the bid deadline for the 35 bidders on the Jordanian </p><p>portion of a proposed crude oil pipeline from Baghdad to the </p><p>Zarqa refinery. The new bid deadline for the $365 million </p><p>BOOT (Build, Own, Operate, Transfer) project is July 15. </p><p>According to the Times, this second deadline extension was </p><p>granted at the request of the bidders, who asked for more </p><p>time to conduct feasibility studies.  The GOJ expects </p><p>construction to be completed 15 months after the winning bid </p><p>is announced. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (c)  According to Energy Minister Mohammed Batayneh, the </p><p>capacity of the pipeline would be 100,000 bpd, expandable to </p><p>150,000 bpd with additional pumping stations (refs a,b). </p><p>Current Jordanian demand is 100,000 bpd, with estimated </p><p>growth of 7-8% per year (ref c).  The Zarqa refinery will </p><p>likely hit its refining capacity of approximately 115,000 bpd </p><p>by 2005.  A February 19 Jordan Times article erroneously </p><p>listed capacity at 350,000 bpd.  Energy Ministry Secretary </p><p>General Azmi Khreisat said the GOJ had discussed the </p><p>possibility of one day building an export pipeline with a </p><p>350,000 bpd capacity.  He confirmed to us, though, that the </p><p>only existent concrete plans for the pipeline are for the </p><p>100,000 bpd figure, with expansion to 150,000 only following </p><p>upgrades of the Zarqa refinery - upgrades that would probably </p><p>take a decade to complete. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (c)  If completed, the pipeline would afford Jordan </p><p>significant savings over its current crude transport system. </p><p>Batayneh estimated cost savings of $6/ton (equal to $27 </p><p>million this year), plus recuperation of almost 7% of oil </p><p>imports that are currently lost to inefficiencies in the </p><p>transport system, including tanker accidents on the highway </p><p>(ref b).  Environmental savings have not been calculated. </p><p>(Note:  The claim of 7% loss of oil due to spillage is much </p><p>higher than we can verify independently from observing tanker </p><p>traffic on the Baghdad-Zarqa highway.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p>5.  (c)  Comment:  This pipeline plan has been on the books </p><p>for years.  The fact that interested bidders have asked for </p><p>another extension to continue feasibility studies is an </p><p>indicator that bidders are serious, but are being cautious in </p><p>light of what may be a raft of technical and legal issues. </p><p>Such issues could include limitations on Iraq\'s ability to </p><p>export oil under the oil-for-food program and strict </p><p>procedural guidelines from the UNSC for such exports, all of </p><p>which could call into question the long-term commercial </p><p>viability of the project.  Another complicating factor could </p><p>be uncretainties concerning the Jordan-Iraq oil protocol </p><p>which is subject to renegotiation annually, and which in any </p><p>event could be radically affected by any U.S.-Iraq </p><p>confrontation.  Due to the complexity of such issues, it will </p><p>probably be some time before real progress is made on the </p><p>project -- responsible companies will be cautious about </p><p>building one half of a pipeline to carry oil from a country </p><p>under UN sanctions.  Nevertheless, the GOJ remains committed </p><p>if for no other reason than to save between $30 and $78 </p><p>million per year compared to the current system. </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
