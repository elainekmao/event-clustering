<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KUWAIT 003534 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR NEA/ARP, S/WCI </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/02/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PHUM, PINR, KU </p><p>SUBJECT: (C) MINISTER SHARAR URGES ACTION ON GUANTANAMO </p><p>DETAINEES </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMB. RICHARD H. JONES; REASONS 1.5 (B,D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  Minister of State for Cabinet Affairs and </p><p>National Assembly Affairs Sharar told the Ambassador August 2 </p><p>that Kuwaitis look to the US to ensure due process for </p><p>Guantanamo detainees (which include 12 Kuwaitis).  They </p><p>discussed the GOK\'s prospects for cooperation with the </p><p>newly-elected National Assembly, the issue of the "bidoon" </p><p>(stateless persons living in Kuwait), and the situation in </p><p>the region.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) The Ambassador called on Minister of State for </p><p>Cabinet Affairs and National Assembly Affairs Mohammed </p><p>Dhayfallah al-Sharar August 2, as part of his round of </p><p>courtesy calls on members of the new Cabinet formed July 15. </p><p>Pol Chief sat in as notetaker.  The meeting was conducted </p><p>entirely in Arabic. </p><p> </p><p>(C) COOPERATION WITH NATIONAL ASSEMBLY </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>3.  (C) After congratulating Sharar on his reappointment (he </p><p>held the same posts in the last Cabinet), the Ambassador </p><p>asked for his assessment of the new National Assembly elected </p><p>July 5.  Sharar said the results show the people want </p><p>tangible results instead of "grillings" of Ministers and </p><p>similar grandstanding.  He noted the increase in Independents </p><p>at the expense of "parties," whether Islamic Constitutional </p><p>Movement or liberals. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Sharar said the GOK was preparing a sort of roadmap </p><p>that it would present to the National Assembly in October, </p><p>showing priorities, timelines, costs, and any needed </p><p>legislation.  He mentioned the issue of the "bidoon" </p><p>(stateless persons in Kuwait), saying it needs to be </p><p>addressed in a balanced way, not necessarily by granting </p><p>citizenship.  In his view, the bidoon, whose number he </p><p>estimated at 40,000, know they are better off in Kuwait with </p><p>their present ambiguous status than they would be in their </p><p>countries of origin:  Saudi Arabia, Syria, Iraq and Iran.  He </p><p>added that some 26,000 bidoon "got their passports" in the </p><p>past four years. </p><p> </p><p>(C) GUANTANAMO DETAINEES </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>5.  (C) Referring to the planned September visit to </p><p>Washington by Prime Minister Shaykh Sabah, Sharar said </p><p>Kuwait\'s alliance with the US is fundamental and needs </p><p>continual high-level dialogue.  He then raised the issue of </p><p>Kuwaiti detainees at Guantanamo, saying Kuwaiti citizens keep </p><p>asking what US policy is.  He stated that a great country </p><p>should ensure due process and dispose of cases fairly.  In </p><p>response to his question, the Ambassador said he did not have </p><p>any new information to share, but was aware that the GOK </p><p>Ambassador in Washington had discussed the issue with US </p><p>officials.  He noted that we have released some detainees </p><p>after deciding they were innocent, and highlighted the </p><p>potentially disastrous consequences of releasing unreformed </p><p>killers.  The Ambassador added that the USG was still </p><p>developing its position on possible bilateral agreements </p><p>under which detainees might be repatriated. </p><p> </p><p>(C) IRAQ AND THE REGION </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>6.  (C) Sharar asked how things were going in Iraq.  The </p><p>Ambassador replied that public services are improving slowly, </p><p>and the death of Uday and Qusay has made the population more </p><p>willing to help us.  Bechtel had begun work, and had </p><p>contracts with Kuwaiti firms.  Sharar replied that Kuwaitis </p><p>feel their country should have a leading role in rebuilding </p><p>Iraq.  They applaud the elimination of Saddam\'s regime, which </p><p>posed a danger to the world, and hope to hear news of his </p><p>capture or death.  Sharar assessed that tension had lessened </p><p>a great deal between Kuwaitis and Iraqis, who are bound by </p><p>historical ties.  The two countries have mutual interests, </p><p>especially in the economic realm.  He said there were plans </p><p>for a free trade zone on the border, and perhaps for a </p><p>Kuwaiti trade exhibition in Baghdad.  Iraqi businesspeople </p><p>were buying goods in Kuwait for sale in Iraq, and the GOK was </p><p>facilitating their movements.  The Ambassador suggested that </p><p>if they consolidated their shipments, it would enable them to </p><p>share the cost of necessary security for their trucks. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) In reply to Sharar\'s question, the Ambassador said he </p><p>was optimistic about the future of the region overall.  He </p><p>noted the serious efforts to achieve an Israeli-Palestinian </p><p>agreement.  The Minister responded approvingly that this is </p><p>"the main cause" of Arab disaffection with the US.  Resolving </p><p>that conflict would lead to positive changes in Syria and </p><p>Lebanon as well, he added.  He laughed in agreement when the </p><p>Ambassador observed that America has two kinds of critics in </p><p>the Arab World: those who believe we intervene too much and </p><p>those who don\'t think we intervene enough. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) On Iran, Sharar said he has seen many changes there </p><p>over the years since the Islamic revolution.  The population </p><p>is tired of the mullahs\' rule and wants a more open society. </p><p>The Ambassador noted the benefits of separating religion and </p><p>state.  Sharar replied "that\'s a point of view," before </p><p>declaring that persons of all faiths enjoyed freedom under </p><p>Islamic rule as practiced by the "rightly guided caliphs." </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
