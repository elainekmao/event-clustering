<p>UNCLAS OTTAWA 002173 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR WHA/CAN, WHA/PDA </p><p>WHITE HOUSE PASS NSC/WEUROPE, NSC/WHA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, KMDR, OIIP, OPRC, CA, TFUS01, TFUS02, TFUS03 </p><p>SUBJECT:  MEDIA REACTION: AFRICA; ECONIMIC ISSUES/WTO; </p><p>MIDDLE EAST </p><p> </p><p>AFRICA </p><p>1.   "The Plague" </p><p>Editorialist Mario Roy wrote in the centrist La Presse </p><p>(7/29): "Five years ago the main obstacle to fighting </p><p>AIDS was the cost: $10,000 per year per patient. Today </p><p>AIDS victims can be treated for less than a dollar a </p><p>day. Important financial contributions are presently </p><p>being made: the main donors are the United States, </p><p>Great Britain, the World Bank and the Gates Foundation. </p><p>More have been announced: the White House pledged $15 </p><p>billion over the next five years - although Congress </p><p>has pared down that figure - and the E.U. has pledged </p><p>$5 billion. Other problems remain: patents...logistics </p><p>and culture. The latter two being the most difficult to </p><p>solve.... Speaking before the African Union early this </p><p>month, Kofi Annan said Africa has to take its own </p><p>responsibilities and that at all levels, the fight </p><p>against AIDS should be the top priority. This implies </p><p>defusing conflicts, democratizing and fighting </p><p>corruption. That is a much taller order than smashing </p><p>shop windows, but it is the only thing that can really </p><p>work." </p><p> </p><p>ECONIMIC ISSUES/WTO </p><p>2.   "Leaving the jungle behind" </p><p>Editorialist Jean-Marc Salvet wrote in the centrist Le </p><p>Soleil (7/29): "The UN Report points out that the </p><p>subsidies given to the American cotton farmers are </p><p>three times bigger than American Aid to sub-Saharan </p><p>Africa. And that each European dairy cow gets more </p><p>support than Europe gives to each human being in that </p><p>same African region.... Unless one prefers the law of </p><p>the jungle, it goes without saying that an agreement on </p><p>agriculture and drugs will be better than no agreement </p><p>at all. Not to discuss these topics would favor the </p><p>status quo. The Montreal mini-summit is not a calamity </p><p>but an opportunity. We need to strive for more </p><p>regulations of international trade; we need fair </p><p>regulations. Otherwise the law of the jungle will keep </p><p>on prevailing." </p><p> </p><p>MIDDLE EAST </p><p>3.   "Ariel Sharon and the wall" </p><p>Editorialist Serge Truffaut wrote in the liberal Le </p><p>Devoir (7/29): "In Washington, Mahmoud Abbas\' message </p><p>was clearly heard. To wit, President Bush has been </p><p>hammering the point that a wall winding its way through </p><p>the West Bank would considerably slow down the trust </p><p>being developed between the parties.... These past two </p><p>days the Sharon government has had to make concessions </p><p>to...maintain the credibility or the sympathy it had in </p><p>the days of Yasser Arafat. Several experts have noted </p><p>that the Palestinian cause is perceived differently </p><p>since Abbas has taken over.... Abbas has even been able </p><p>to manoeuvre with enough craftsmanship to contain his </p><p>troops without having his leadership strongly </p><p>challenged. It is now up to Sharon to show some </p><p>goodwill. He eventually will have to pledge to stop the </p><p>construction of the wall. It remains to be seen if he </p><p>will be able to convince the extremists in his </p><p>coalition. If that is not the case, there will be new </p><p>elections within twelve months." </p><p> </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
