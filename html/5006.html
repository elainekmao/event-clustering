(U) THE POPE AND SENIOR VATICAN OFFICIALS HAVE LAUNCHED AN </p><p>END OF YEAR "PEACE OFFENSIVE" WITH A SERIES OF STATEMENTS AND </p><p>MESSAGES AIMED AT COUNTERING THE PERCEPTION THAT WAR IN IRAQ </p><p>IS INEVITABLE.  THESE MESSAGES HAVE ALSO URGED THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO PURSUE ALL POSSIBLE STEPS TO AVOID </p><p>WAR.  IN HIS NEW YEAR\'S HOMILY, THE POPE EMPHASIZED THAT </p><p>"PEACE IS POSSIBLE AND A DUTY," WHILE AT CHRISTMAS, HE CALLED </p><p>ON ALL BELIEVERS TO "EXTINGUISH THE OMINOUS SMOLDERING OF A </p><p>CONFLICT WHICH, WITH THE JOINT EFFORTS OF ALL, CAN BE </p><p>AVOIDED."  ALTHOUGH THE HOLY SEE\'S POSITION HAS NOT CHANGED </p><p>SUBSTANTIVELY FROM ITS PREVIOUS POSITION (REFTELS) THAT WAR </p><p>COULD BE JUSTIFIED IF THE UN DETERMINES MILITARY ACTION </p><p>NECESSARY AND ALL OTHER MEANS OF AVOIDING CONFLICT ARE </p><p>EXHAUSTED, RECENT STATEMENTS HAVE HAD GREATER URGENCY AND A </p><p>SHARPER TONE, SUGGESTING THAT THE HOLY SEE WOULD LIKELY </p><p>CONDEMN ANY ACTION THAT OCCURRED WITHOUT UN AUTHORIZATION OR </p><p>WITHOUT ALLOWING THE INSPECTION PROCESS TO RUN ITS COURSE. </p><p>THE HOLY SEE CONTINUES TO REJECT THE NOTION OF A PRE-EMPTIVE </p><p>WAR, ASSERTING THAT IT WOULD LEAD TO "THE LAW OF THE JUNGLE" </p><p>WITH EVERY COUNTRY BEING EMPOWERED TO TAKE UNILATERAL ACTION </p><p>TO RESOLVE PROBLEMS WITH NEIGHBORS OR ENEMIES.  THE POPE HAS </p><p>ALSO REPEATEDLY SPOKEN OUT ABOUT THE ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN </p><p>CONFLICT, WITH BALANCED CALLS FOR AN END TO THE SPIRAL OF </p><p>BLIND VIOLENCE AND SUFFERING OF ALL THE PEOPLES IN THE </p><p>REGION.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>SEIZING THE \'BULLY PULPIT\' FOR PEACE </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  00059  01 OF 03  081341Z </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) TAKING FULL ADVANTAGE OF THE \'BULLY PULPIT\' AFFORDED </p><p>THE POPE BY THE MANY HOLIDAY SEASON MASSES AND MESSAGES HEARD </p><p>BY MILLIONS WORLDWIDE, HE AND SENIOR VATICAN OFFICIALS HAVE </p><p>BEEN ACTIVELY PUSHING A \'MESSAGE OF PEACE\' TO COUNTER </p><p>ACCEPTANCE OF THE INEVITABILITY OF WAR IN IRAQ AND OF </p><p>CONTINUED VIOLENCE IN ISRAEL AND PALESTINIAN TERRITORIES. </p><p>ACCORDING TO ARCHBISHOP RENATO MARTINO, NEWLY APPOINTED HEAD </p><p>OF THE COUNCIL FOR JUSTICE AND PEACE, THE POPE IS "GENUINELY </p><p>VERY CONCERNED BY THE EVENTS THAT COULD TAKE PLACE IN THE </p><p>NEAR FUTURE."  ACCORDING TO MARTINO, THE POPE IS DOING </p><p>"EVERYTHING IN HIS POWER TO AVOID A DETERIORATION IN THE </p><p>SITUATION THAT COULD END IN CONFLICT." BEGINNING WITH HIS </p><p>CHRISTMAS DAY "URBI ET ORBI" ADDRESS, TELEVISED IN OVER 50 </p><p>COUNTRIES, THE POPE APPEALED TO THE WORLD "NOT TO YIELD TO </p><p>MISTRUST, SUSPICION, AND DISCOURAGEMENT, EVEN AS THE TRAGIC </p><p>REALITY OF TERRORISM FEEDS UNCERTAINTIES AND FEARS."  HE </p><p>FURTHER CALLED ON BELIEVERS AND MEN OF GOODWILL TO </p><p>"EXTINGUISH THE OMINOUS SMOLDERING OF A CONFLICT WHICH, WITH </p><p>THE JOINT EFFORTS OF ALL CAN BE AVOIDED." </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) AT THE NEW YEAR\'S MASS, THE POPE CALLED FOR PEACEFUL </p><p>MEANS TO OVERCOME INTERNATIONAL TENSIONS, STATING THAT </p><p>"BEFORE THE CONFLICTS OF THE DAY AND THE THREATENING TENSIONS </p><p>OF THE MOMENT, ONCE AGAIN I INVITE ALL TO PRAY SO THAT </p><p>PEACEFUL MEANS OF AGREEMENT WILL BE SOUGHT...IN HARMONY WITH </p><p>INTERNATIONAL LAW."  HE EMPHASIZED THAT "DESPITE SERIOUS AND </p><p>REPEATED ATTACKS AGAINST THE SERENE AND SHARED COEXISTENCE OF </p><p>PEOPLES, PEACE IS POSSIBLE AND A DUTY... AND MUST BE </p><p>CONSTRUCTED WITH EVERY EFFORT."  AFTERWARD, GREETING TENS OF </p><p>THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE, INCLUDING PEACE MARCHERS FORM THE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  00059  01 OF 03  081341Z </p><p>SANT\'EGIDIO COMMUNITY THROUGHOUT ITALY, THE POPE RECEIVED </p><p>EXTENDED APPLAUSE WHEN HE DECLARED:  "HOW CAN ONE NOT EXPRESS </p><p>ONCE AGAIN THE HOPE THAT AMONG THOSE WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE, </p><p>EVERYTHING POSSIBLE WILL BE DONE TO FIND PEACEFUL SOLUTIONS </p><p>TO THE MANY TENSIONS PRESENT IN THE WORLD, PARTICULARLY IN </p><p>THE MIDDLE EAST, AVOIDING FURTHER SUFFERINGS TO THOSE PEOPLES </p><p>WHO HAVE BEEN SO TRIED." </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>COUNTERING INEVITABILITY OF WAR </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) IN A PRE-CHRISTMAS TOUR D\'HORIZON INTERVIEW IN </p><p>ROME\'S LA REPUBBLICA NEWSPAPER, FOREIGN MINISTER JEAN-LOUIS </p><p>TAURAN LAUNCHED THE HOLIDAY PEACE BLITZ WITH THE THEME THAT </p><p>"THE USE OF ARMS IS NOT AN INEVITABLE FATALITY, AND WHAT IS </p><p>MORE, NO PROVISION IS MADE IN THE UN CHARTER FOR A PREVENTIVE </p><p>WAR."  TAURAN WENT ON TO UNDERSCORE BAGHDAD\'S RESPONSIBILITY </p><p>TO "APPLY POLICIES IN ACCORD WITH STANDARDS OF CONDUCT THAT </p><p>GO WITH BEING A MEMBER OF THE UNITED NATIONS."  NOTING THAT </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ8600 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        VATICA  00059  02 OF 03  081342Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AMAD-00  CIAE-00  INL-00   USNW-00  DODE-00 </p><p>      DS-00    UTED-00  VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01 </p><p>      VCE-00   NEA-00   DCP-01   NSAE-00  DHS-00   IRM-00   TEST-00 </p><p>      DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-02   NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00    /004W </p><p>                  ------------------21D465  081342Z /38 </p><p>P 081319Z JAN 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY VATICAN </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>INFO EUROPEAN POLITICAL COLLECTIVE </p><p>ISLAMIC CONFERENCE COLLECTIVE </p><p>AMEMBASSY TEL AVIV </p><p>AMCONSUL JERUSALEM </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 03 VATICAN 000059 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EUR/WE MENNUTI AND NEA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, IS, IZ, VT </p><p>SUBJECT: POPE LAUNCHES END OF YEAR PEACE OFFENSIVE </p><p> </p><p>HE HAD CONVEYED TO THE U.S. TWO MONTHS EARLIER (REFTELS) THE </p><p>HOLY SEE\'S VIEW OF THE NEED FOR DIALOGUE AND THE IMPORTANCE </p><p>OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY ASSUMING RESPONSIBILITY IN THE </p><p>FACE OF IRAQI DEFAULT, HE INSISTED THAT "NOTHING SHOULD BE </p><p>DECIDED WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF NATIONS AND INTERNATIONAL </p><p>INSTITUTIONS." </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  00059  02 OF 03  081342Z </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) TAURAN WAS SHARPLY CRITICAL OF POTENTIAL UNILATERAL </p><p>U.S. ACTION, INSISTING THAT "IT CANNOT BE THAT A MEMBER OF </p><p>THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY CAN DECIDE: \'I WILL DO THIS AND </p><p>YOU WILL HELP ME, OTHERWISE, STAY AT HOME.\'"  IF THIS WERE TO </p><p>HAPPEN, TAURAN CAUTIONED, "THE WHOLE SYSTEM OF INTERNATIONAL </p><p>RULES WOULD CRUMBLE, AND ONE WOULD RISK THE LAW OF THE </p><p>JUNGLE."  INEVITABLY, IN HIS VIEW, INDIVIDUAL STATES HAVING </p><p>DISPUTES WITH OTHER STATES WOULD, USING THE SAME LOGIC, </p><p>DECIDE THAT THEY WOULD "PUT THINGS IN ORDER" UNILATERALLY. </p><p>JUSTICE AND PEACE\'S MARTINO ALSO CAUTIONED AGAINST </p><p>UNILATERALISM RECENTLY, OBSERVING THAT "WE SHOULD REJECT </p><p>UNILATERALISM, AS WELL AS THE IDEA OF A WORLD POLICEMAN." </p><p>BOTH MARTINO AND FM TAURAN HAVE SPOKEN OF THE VALUE OF A </p><p>"MODERATING" EUROPEAN INFLUENCE, AIMED AT TAKING ADVANTAGE OF </p><p>ALL THE MEANS OF INTERNATIONAL LAW AND OFFERING ALL MEDIATION </p><p>POSSIBLE TO PREVENT WAR.  TAURAN CITED A COMMON CONVICTION IN </p><p>HIS CONTACTS WITH EUROPEAN AND ARAB LEADERS THAT "WAR IS NOT </p><p>THE ANSWER TO THE PROBLEM."  IN THIS REGARD, HE CITED WHAT IS </p><p>A GROWING VATICAN FEAR THAT WAR COULD UNLEASH AN </p><p>ANTI-CHRISTIAN, ANTI-WESTERN BACKLASH IN THE MUSLIM WORLD. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p>BUT RECOGNIZING LEGITIMACY OF ACTION AGAINST IRAQ </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) DESPITE THE PEACE OFFENSIVE, WHICH THE MEDIA HAS </p><p>WIDELY HAILED AS A SIGN THAT THE HOLY SEE WILL OPPOSE ANY </p><p>ACTION AGAINST IRAQ, THE HOLY SEE\'S POSITION REMAINS MORE </p><p>NUANCED THAN OFTEN PORTRAYED IN THE ITALIAN AND INTERNATIONAL </p><p>MEDIA.  IN FACT, EVEN AS TAURAN REJECTED THE IDEA OF A </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  00059  02 OF 03  081342Z </p><p>UNILATERAL PREVENTIVE WAR, HE DID NOT EXCLUDE THE POSSIBILITY </p><p>OF A MILITARY INTERVENTION "IF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, </p><p>DRAWING ON INTERNATIONAL LAW AND IN PARTICULAR RESOLUTIONS OF </p><p>THE SECURITY COUNCIL, DETERMINED THAT OPPORTUNE AND </p><p>PROPORTIONATE RECOURSE TO FORCE."  THIS IS IN LINE WITH THE </p><p>HOLY SEE\'S VIEW THAT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE </p><p>MUST TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR POTENTIAL IRAQI FAILINGS TO </p><p>RESPECT THE WILL OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>U.S. NUCLEAR WEAPONS DISCUSSION EVOKES REBUKE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) THE RECENT REPORTS FROM WASHINGTON ABOUT THE </p><p>POSSIBILITY OF THE U.S. USING NUCLEAR WEAPONS IN RESPONSE TO </p><p>A WMD ATTACK AGAINST THE U.S. EVOKED A HARSH REBUKE FROM </p><p>TAURAN, WHO SAID "IT WOULD BE BETTER NOT TO EVEN ECHO THIS </p><p>HYPOTHESIS, AS IT SEEMS SO MONSTROUS TO ME." </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p>SITUATION IN THE HOLY LANDS CONTINUES TO WEIGH ON POPE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) THE POPE\'S PEACE MESSAGE WAS NOT ONLY FOCUSED ON IRAQ, </p><p>BUT ALSO ON WHAT HE TERMED "THE SENSELESS SPIRAL OF BLIND </p><p>VIOLENCE" IN THE HOLY LAND.  SPEAKING ON THE SITUATION IN THE </p><p>MIDDLE EAST IN HIS WORLD DAY OF PEACE MESSAGE JANUARY 1, THE </p><p>POPE OBSERVED THAT "THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF BITTER MUTUAL </p><p>REJECTION AND AN UNENDING CHAIN OF VIOLENCE AND RETALIATION </p><p>HAVE SHATTERED EVERY EFFORT THUS FAR TO ENGAGE IN SERIOUS </p><p>DIALOGUE ON THE REAL ISSUES INVOLVED."  THE POPE SAID IT </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  00059  02 OF 03  081342Z </p><p>WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO CONCEIVE OF PROGRESS UNTIL THOSE IN </p><p>POSITIONS OF POWER BEGIN TO USE THEIR POWER TO IMPLEMENT </p><p>POLICIES BASED ON RESPECT FOR HUMAN DIGNITY AND HUMAN RIGHTS. </p><p> FM TAURAN REITERATED THAT THE HOLY SEE\'S POSITION ON THE </p><p>"THE MOTHER OF ALL CONFLICTS" REMAINS: RESPECT FOR THE OTHER </p><p>AND HIS LEGITIMATE ASPIRATIONS, WITHDRAWAL FROM THE OCCUPIED </p><p>TERRITORIES, PRESENCE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY ON THE </p><p>GROUND, AND INTERNATIONAL GUARANTEES FOR THE HOLY SITES. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) THE TRADITIONAL CHRISTMAS THEME OF \'PEACE ON EARTH\' </p><p>OFFERS A NATURAL FOCUS FOR THE HOLY SEE TO PROMOTE ITS </p><p>PREFERRED VISION OF A PEACEFUL SOLUTION TO THE IRAQ CRISIS. </p><p>THE POPE\'S PLEAS RECEIVED A WARM RECEPTION AT THE TRADITIONAL </p><p>MASSES AND IN ST.
