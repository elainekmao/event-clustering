<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 03 ADDIS ABABA 003801 </p><p> </p><p>C O R R E C T E D  C O P Y  -- PAR NUMBERING AND CLASSIFICATIONS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/21/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PREL, PINS, ET </p><p>SUBJECT: ETHIOPIA: 2002 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) STATE 201772 B) ADDIS ABABA 2978 C) ADDIS </p><p>     ABABA 3273 D) ADDIS ABABA 2973 E) IIR 6 830 </p><p>     0115 02 F) IIR 7 723 0396 02 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: COUNSELOR FOR POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC AFFAIRS </p><p>DAVID C BECKER FOR REASONS 1.5 (B), (C) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C)  SUMMARY:  ETHIOPIA IS A CONFIRMED AND COMMITTED </p><p>PARTNER IN THE GLOBAL WAR ON TERRORISM (GWOT) AT ALL LEVELS. </p><p>ALTHOUGH OFTEN LACKING IN CAPACITY, THE GOVERNMENT OF THE </p><p>FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA (GFDRE) HAS RESPONDED </p><p>PRO-ACTIVELY TO THE GLOBAL THREAT.  EMBASSY KNOWS OF NO </p><p>FOREIGN TERRORIST ORGANIZATION (FTO) ACTIVITY IN ETHIOPIA, </p><p>AND NO SUCH TOLERANCE BY THE GOVERNMENT.  THE GWOT FITS </p><p>NEATLY INTO THE RULING COALITION\'S POLITICAL AGENDA, WHICH </p><p>EQUATES ARMED OPPOSITION WITH INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM. </p><p>ETHIOPIA\'S CURRENT GOVERNMENT WILL REMAIN WITH US AS A </p><p>STEADFAST PARTNER AGAINST TERRORISM. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>ANNUAL RESPONSE </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U)  THE FOLLOWING RESPONSES FOR 2002 ARE KEYED TO </p><p>INSTRUCTIONS IN REFTEL A, PARA. 2: </p><p> </p><p>A. (U)  THE GFDRE STANDS FIRMLY AGAINST ALL FORMS OF </p><p>INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM, AND HAS CONSISTENTLY OFFERED </p><p>COOPERATION TO SUPPORT THE GWOT. </p><p> </p><p>B. (U)  THE JUDICIARY HAS NOT HAD TO RESPOND TO ANY ACTS OF </p><p>INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>C. (U)  ETHIOPIA HAS NOT EXTRADITED NOR REQUESTED </p><p>EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS FOR PROSECUTION.  IF </p><p>REQUESTED, THE GFDRE WOULD EXTRADITE SUSPECTED TERRORISTS TO </p><p>THE U.S. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE NO EXTRADITION TREATY. </p><p> </p><p>D. (U)  THE GFDRE\'S ABILITY TO RESPOND EFFECTIVELY TO </p><p>TERRORISM IS HAMPERED BY INSUFFICIENT FUNDING AND INADEQUATE </p><p>TRAINING OF ITS SECURITY FORCES AND JUDICIARY.  CRIMINAL </p><p>CASES OFTEN LANGUISH IN THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM AND SUSPECTS CAN </p><p>SPEND YEARS AWAITING TRIAL. </p><p> </p><p>E. (U)  GFDRE RESPONSES TO TERRORISM: THE GFDRE HAS </p><p>CONSISTENTLY CONDEMNED TERRORISM, INCLUDING THE 1998 NAIROBI </p><p>AND DAR ES SALAAM BOMBINGS AND THE 9/11 ATTACKS.  PRIME </p><p>MINISTER MELES ZENAWI REGULARLY CONDEMNS ALL FORMS OF </p><p>TERRORISM.  THE GFDRE HAS TAKEN ACTIONS TO CONTROL ITS BORDER </p><p>WITH SOMALIA TO PREVENT SMUGGLING AND TERRORIST MOVEMENT. THE </p><p>GFDRE AND THE GOVERNMENT OF DJIBOUTI ARE DISCUSSING WAYS TO </p><p>REDUCE TERRORISTS, ABILITY TO MOVE ACROSS THEIR BORDER EN </p><p>ROUTE TO AND FROM YEMEN. </p><p> </p><p>F. (U) SIGNIFICANT GFDRE COUNTERTERRORISM (CT) ACTIVITIES </p><p>INCLUDE POLITICAL, FINANCIAL, MEDIA, MILITARY AND LAW </p><p>ENFORCEMENT ACTION.   ETHIOPIA SIGNED THE OAU DRAFT </p><p>CONVENTION ON TERRORISM PRIOR TO ATTENDING THE SEPTEMBER </p><p>11-14 AFRICAN UNION TERRORISM CONFERENCE IN ALGIERS (ALTHOUGH </p><p>THEY FAVORED THE "FREEDOM FIGHTER" CLAUSE DESPITE EMBASSY,S </p><p>REFTEL B REQUEST).  IN A STATEMENT AFTER A SEPTEMBER BOMBING </p><p>OF AN ADDIS ABABA HOTEL, THE GFDRE SAID ETHIOPIA HAD BEEN </p><p>PLAGUED BY TERRORISM LONG BEFORE THE GWOT.  IN OCTOBER, </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER SEYOUM MESFIN TOLD UNGA THAT ALL WHO </p><p>DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY SUPPORT AND ENCOURAGE TERRORISM SHOULD </p><p>BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. THE ETHIOPIAN CENTRAL BANK HAS BEEN </p><p>PROMPT IN COMPLYING WITH OUR REQUESTS FOR NAME CHECKS AND </p><p>ASSET FREEZES.  TO OUR KNOWLEDGE, NO FTOS HAVE ASSETS IN </p><p>ETHIOPIA.  TO COUNTER THE THREAT OF AL-ITTIHAD AL-ISLAMIYA </p><p>(AIAI), THE GFDRE HAS UNDERTAKEN INCREASED MILITARY EFFORTS </p><p>TO CONTROL ITS LONG BORDER WITH SOMALIA. MEDIA REPORTS </p><p>INDICATE THAT FOUR PAKISTANIS WERE ARRESTED IN DIRE DAWA "ON </p><p>SUSPICION OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST ACTIVITY." POLICE </p><p>ARRESTED FOUR YEMENIS AND THREE PAKISTANIS ENTERING FROM </p><p>SUDAN.  WHILE IN TRANSIT TO ADDIS ABABA, THE SUSPECTS KILLED </p><p>A GUARD AND ALL SEVEN MANAGED TO ESCAPE. </p><p> </p><p>G. (U)  THE GFDRE DOES NOT LEND SUPPORT TO INTERNATIONAL </p><p>TERRORISM, AND OFFERS NO SUPPORT, PRIVILEGES OR TRAINING TO </p><p>TERRORISTS. </p><p> </p><p>H. (U)  THE GFDRE HAS NOT MADE ANY PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN </p><p>SUPPORT OF ANY TERRORIST-SUPPORTING COUNTRIES ON ISSUES </p><p>RELATED TO TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>I. (U)  THERE HAS BEEN NO CHANGE IN THE GFDRE\'S STRONG </p><p>SUPPORT FOR THE COALITION AGAINST TERRORISM IN 2002. </p><p> </p><p>J. (U)  THE GFDRE HAS CONSISTENTLY OFFERED FULL COOPERATION </p><p>IN THE GWOT, AND BURNISHES ITS ROLE AS A U.S. PARTNER.  THE </p><p>EMBASSY WORKS CLOSELY WITH MANY GFDRE COMPONENTS IN ALL </p><p>FACETS OF CT.  SEYOUM RECENTLY TOLD THE AMBASSADOR, "UNLESS </p><p>OUR CAPACITY LIMITS US, WE WILL NOT FAIL YOU." </p><p> </p><p>K. (U)  THE EMBASSY HAS RECEIVED CONTINUING COOPERATION FROM </p><p>THE GFDRE IN THE INVESTIGATION FOLLOWING THE 9/11 ATTACKS. </p><p> </p><p>L. (U)  THE GFDRE IS FULLY RESPONSIVE TO REQUESTS TO PROTECT </p><p>U.S. CITIZENS AND FACILITIES. </p><p></p><p>------------------------- </p><p>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  CONFIRMING REF. C, WE KNOW OF NO FTOS ON ETHIOPIAN </p><p>SOIL ACTIVE OR WORTH WATCHING. </p><p> </p><p>4. (S)  MELES MAY BE GOING TOO FAR:  THE PM MAY HAVE SOME </p><p>DIFFICULTY DISTINGUISHING THE GWOT FROM SECTARIAN RIVALRY. </p><p>AS REPORTED IN REF. D, MELES TOLD CODEL IN AUGUST THAT </p><p>ETHIOPIA IS IN THE GWOT FOR ITS OWN NATIONAL SECURITY.  HIS </p><p>PRIVATE COMMENTS INDICATE THAT HE MAY HAVE SOME DIFFICULTY </p><p>DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN ISLAM, ISLAMISM, AND TERRORISM.  HE </p><p>EQUATES ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALISM WITH TERRORISM, SAYING </p><p>WAHHABISM IS "INFILTRATING AND DOMINATING THE REGION."  HE </p><p>DESCRIBES ETHIOPIA AS BEING "AT THE EPICENTER" OF TERRORISM </p><p>SINCE THE SEVENTH CENTURY (REF. E).  FORTUNATELY, MELES HAS </p><p>NOT MADE ANY PUBLIC STATEMENTS BETRAYING SUCH A </p><p>"LUMP-THEM-ALL-TOGETHER" OUTLOOK.  THE OPPOSITION IS ALSO </p><p>WORRIED ABOUT THE POTENTIAL SPREAD OF EXTREMISM, AND, NOT </p><p>PRIVY TO THE GOVERNMENT\'S ACTIONS, FEARS THE GFDRE IS NOT </p><p>DOING ENOUGH.  ACCORDING TO A PROMINENT OPPOSITION </p><p>POLITICIAN, OVERT SAUDI AND COVERT IRANIAN INFLUENCE ARE </p><p>SPREADING EXTREMISM WHILE THE RULING COALITION IS TOLERATING </p><p>AN INCREASE IN SECTARIANISM. </p><p> </p><p>5. (S)  A SOURCE WITH UNESTABLISHED RELIABILITY HAS REPORTED </p><p>THAT THE ERITREAN "GREATER ALLIANCE," AN UMBRELLA GROUP </p><p>CONSISTING OF TEN ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDING THE ERITREAN </p><p>ISLAMIC JIHAD, HAS MOVED ITS HEADQUARTERS TO ETHIOPIA.  WE </p><p>HAVE SEEN THE REF. F REPORT THAT THE JIHAD IS BELIEVED TO </p><p>RECEIVE POLITICAL BACKING FROM THE GFDRE, BUT CANNOT CONFIRM </p><p>SUCH. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) THE GFDRE CONSIDERS ITS DOMESTIC ARMED OPPOSITION AS </p><p>TERRORISTS, DRAWING LITTLE JURIDICAL DISTINCTION BETWEEN SUCH </p><p>DIPARATE GROUPS AS AL-QAEDA AND THE HOME-GROWN OROMO </p><p>LIBERATION FRONT (OLF).  MELES TOLD PARLIAMENT IN SEPTEMBER </p><p>THAT THE FIGHT AGAINST THE OLF SHOULD NOT BE SEEN IN </p><p>ISOLATION FROM THE GWOT. THE GFDRE WILL LIKELY CONTINUE </p><p>SEEKING USG SUPPORT AGAINST THE OLF, INCLUDING ITS ADDITION </p><p>TO EXECUTIVE ORDERS AS AN FTO.  THE OLF IS WIDELY BELIEVED TO </p><p>HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR A JUNE ATTACK ON A RAILWAY STATION </p><p>IN DIRE DAWA AND A SEPTEMBER BOMBING OF AN ADDIS ABABA HOTEL. </p><p> THE TEN HOTEL BOMBING SUSPECTS APPEARED IN COURT THIS WEEK </p><p>AND PLED NOT GUILTY. THE OLF HAS DENIED THE GFDRE\'S PUBLIC </p><p>ALLEGATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C)  COMMENT:  MELES FINDS THE GWOT POLITICALLY </p><p>ADVANTAGEOUS FOR BOTH ETHIOPIA AND HIS RULING COALITION, AND </p><p>EVEN CALLED IT A "GODSEND" BECAUSE OF ETHIOPIA\'S UNFORTUNATE </p><p>EXPERIENCE WITH INTERNAL VIOLENCE AND INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM </p><p>(AS THEY DEFINE IT).  SHORTLY AFTER 9/11, ETHIOPIAN MILITARY </p><p>LEADERS SOUGHT U.S. ENGAGEMENT IN A PROPOSAL FOR A SERIES OF </p><p>LARGE-SCALE STRIKES ON NEIGHBORING SOMALIA, A BREEDING GROUND </p><p>AND SAFEHAVEN FOR TERRORISTS, AND A PERENNIAL THORN IN THE </p><p>SIDE OF EVERY ETHIOPIAN GOVERNMENT.  FOR THIS GOVERNMENT, THE </p><p>GWOT IS A TWO-FER: THEY USE IT TO DRAW CLOSER TO THE U.S. </p><p>AND/AND GAIN RESOURCES FOR THEIR OWN CT EFFORTS. END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BRAZEAL </p><p></p></div>
