<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 000138 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS, S/CT, DS/IP/SA, AND DS/OSAC </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/EREIDEL </p><p>TREASURY FOR OFAC/NEWCOMB </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PINS, ASEC, CASC, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: MAOISTS MAY FORCE COCA-COLA FROM NEPAL </p><p> </p><p>REF: 2002 KATHMANDU 2440 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) This cable contains business-sensitive information and </p><p>should be handled accordingly. </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p>======= </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) On January 22, Embassy officers met with Security </p><p>Managers for Coca-Cola, who are in Nepal to assess the risk </p><p>posed to its plants, distributors, and retailers after a </p><p>Maoist extortion request.  The representatives also met with </p><p>the Government of Nepal (GoN) to determine if any additional </p><p>security assistance would be forthcoming.  Given the Maoists\' </p><p>persistence and the GoN\'s apparent inability to guarantee </p><p>security for all of Coca-Cola operations, the company is </p><p>reviewing the possibility of closing operations in Nepal. </p><p>Should Coca-Cola withdraw from Nepal, the country will lose </p><p>its third largest taxpayer, a valuable employer, and its most </p><p>visible American commercial presence.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>Assessing Risks with Few Alternatives </p><p>===================================== </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) On January 22, Embassy officers met with Mr. Gordon </p><p>Sjue and Mr. Arthur Eberhart, Security Managers for The </p><p>Coca-Cola Company.   Coca-Cola is concerned with the threat </p><p>posed to its local operations (including 2 bottling plants, </p><p>63 distributors, and 38,000 retail locations) by the </p><p>company\'s refusal to meet a Maoist extortion request of USD </p><p>38,000 (reftel).  Over the course of the insurgency, the two </p><p>bottling plants have been bombed three times, and three </p><p>distributors have been scared away from carrying Coca-Cola </p><p>products due to direct Maoist threats.  The representatives </p><p>believe that in view of the attacks Coca-Cola interests have </p><p>already undergone, its continued presence in Nepal is at </p><p>significant risk that may force closure of operations.  The </p><p>representatives will deliver a security risk assessment and </p><p>recommendations to their regional headquarters in Bangkok and </p><p>corporate headquarters in Atlanta. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) The Coca-Cola representatives assured the Embassy </p><p>that they have no intention of paying the Maoists and </p><p>reported that they had presented a counter-offer to the </p><p>insurgents of financing development projects, such as potable </p><p>water facilities and mobile vision clinics, near their </p><p>bottling plants.  Coca-Cola worked with the Village </p><p>Development Committees and representatives of the Maoists </p><p>over the summer of 2002 to develop these proposals.  However, </p><p>the Maoists have now refused to accept any alternatives and </p><p>demand cash payment. </p><p> </p><p>GoN May Mourn the Loss, But Offers No Additional Help </p><p>============================================= ======== </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Sjue, Eberhart, and the RSO also met with Major </p><p>General Katwal, Co-coordinator for the National Security </p><p>Secretariat, to assess the Government of Nepal\'s (GoN) </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>ability to provide additional security for Coca-Cola\'s </p><p>distributors and retailers.  In a frank discussion, MG Katwal </p><p>stated that he could not offer protection beyond that already </p><p>provided at the two bottling plants.  He was encouraged that </p><p>Coca-Cola had decided not to meet the Maoists\' extortion </p><p>demands and had countered with development projects. </p><p>However, he agreed with Coca-Cola\'s representatives and the </p><p>RSO that the Maoists were more likely interested in cash at </p><p>the moment, probably to fund arms purchases.  When confronted </p><p>with the possibility that Coca-Cola may have to close, MG </p><p>Katwal reflected that its closure would be felt by the GoN </p><p>and may have negative implications for other multinational </p><p>corporations.  While concerned, he did not offer additional </p><p>GoN support to ensure Coca-Cola\'s continued operation. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>======= </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) The loss of Coca-Cola will have a significant impact </p><p>on Nepal\'s economy.  The company has 500 direct-hire </p><p>employees, with significant indirect employment through its </p><p>distributors and retailers; serves as Nepal\'s third largest </p><p>taxpayer; and represents the second largest American </p><p>investment in Nepal.  The push for cash rather than projects </p><p>that uplift the Nepali people is yet another demonstration of </p><p>the Maoists\' moral bankruptcy.  With Coca-Cola\'s bottling </p><p>plants relatively secure, the Maoists appear to be shifting </p><p>tactics and threatening Nepali distributors and </p><p>retailers--threats that already have achieved some success. </p><p>Little reliable security can be provided for such a large and </p><p>geographically dispersed corporate operation.  As retailers </p><p>and distributors are not dependent solely on Coca-Cola, they </p><p>are likely to drop its products in the face of repeated </p><p>Maoist threats, despite significant revenue losses.  The </p><p>Embassy will remain in consultation with Coca-Cola management </p><p>on the outcome of their risk assessment and a possible public </p><p>relations strategy for responding to the Maoist threat. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
