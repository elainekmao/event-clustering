<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 COLOMBO 000039 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR E. MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL: 01-07-13 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, PINR, CE, NO, JA, TH, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  Peace Process Update:  Fourth round of talks </p><p>kicks off; PM\'s address to nation; Japanese FM\'s visit </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  (A) Colombo-SA/INS 01/06/03 Fax </p><p> </p><p>-      (B) Oslo 16 </p><p>-      (C) Colombo 14, and previous </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by W. Lewis Amselem, Deputy Chief of </p><p>Mission.  Reasons 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) This update of Sri Lanka\'s peace process reviews </p><p>the following: </p><p> </p><p>>> Fourth round of GSL-LTTE talks begins in Thailand </p><p> </p><p>>> Muslim leader Hakeem attends talks as part of GSL </p><p>team -- and takes other Muslims with him </p><p> </p><p>>> In nationally televised address, Prime Minister </p><p>reviews progress of GSL\'s peace initiative </p><p> </p><p>>> In visit, Foreign Minister Kawaguchi underscores </p><p>Japan\'s support for peace process </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>Start of Fourth Round of Talks </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) The fourth round of Norwegian-facilitated talks </p><p>between the Sri Lankan government and the Liberation </p><p>Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) began at a resort hotel in </p><p>the Bangkok area on January 6. (Note:  The last round of </p><p>talks took place in Oslo in early December.  The </p><p>previous two rounds took place in Thailand in September </p><p>and November.)  The talks are scheduled to continue </p><p>until January 9, with a press briefing slated to take </p><p>place on January 10.  The first day of talks seems to </p><p>have taken place in a cordial atmosphere.  Photos and TV </p><p>news feed of the brief opening ceremony showed GSL and </p><p>LTTE team members standing together and grinning, </p><p>apparently in a relaxed mood. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) In a press briefing late January 6, G.L. </p><p>Peiris, a senior GSL minister and key negotiator, set an </p><p>optimistic tone and related that the first day mainly </p><p>involved developing an agenda for the rest of the </p><p>discussions.  As foreshadowed in Refs B and C, Peiris </p><p>stated that the key agenda items were the Sri Lankan </p><p>military\'s "high security zones" in Jaffna and human </p><p>rights in LTTE-controlled areas.  Before talks wrapped </p><p>up on January 6, the two sides had also begun </p><p>substantive discussions on humanitarian/resettlement </p><p>issues, including prioritization of assistance projects </p><p>and how to handle pledges by donors. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) COMMENT:  Entering this round of talks, there </p><p>were concerns that the two sides would not hit it off </p><p>because of recent disagreements over the Jaffna security </p><p>zones (see Ref C).  So far, however, it appears that the </p><p>government and the Tigers are striving to make things </p><p>work.  In fact, it\'s almost as if they want to prove the </p><p>peace process skeptics back home wrong.  If that spirit </p><p>prevails, it seems likely that the Norwegians will be </p><p>able to put together a positive joint communique at the </p><p>end of the talks, allowing the process as a whole to </p><p>maintain its momentum.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>Muslim Leader Attends Talks, Gains "Advisers" </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) After weeks of confusion, embattled Sri Lanka </p><p>Muslim Congress (SLMC) leader (and senior GSL minister) </p><p>Raul Hakeem is participating in the Thailand talks as a </p><p>member of the government delegation.  (Note:  Hakeem was </p><p>a member of the GSL team at the first three rounds of </p><p>talks.  He had to leave the third round of talks in Oslo </p><p>in December early because a group of party rebels was </p><p>threatening to eject him from the SLMC leadership.)  In </p><p>a new development, three other Muslims have joined </p><p>Hakeem in Thailand.  The three -- M.L.M. Cader, H.S. </p><p>Hasbullah, and M.I.M. Mohiudeen -- are reportedly </p><p>serving in an "advisory" capacity and not directly </p><p>participating in the talks.  (Note:  Cader and Hasbullah </p><p>are educators, who -- along with Hakeem -- are former </p><p>IVP grantees.  Mohiuddin is also well-known, having been </p><p>involved in Muslim politics in the east for years.) </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Asked about the addition of the three Muslim </p><p>advisers, M.L.A.M. Hizbullah, a senior MP for the Muslim </p><p>National Unity Alliance (NUA), told us that Prime </p><p>Minister Wickremesinghe, reacting to complaints by other </p><p>Muslims, had essentially ordered Hakeem to bring </p><p>additional members of the community with him to </p><p>Thailand.  Hizbullah commented that he and other Muslims </p><p>continued to demand that their community be granted </p><p>third party status at the talks and not remain part of </p><p>the government\'s team. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) COMMENT:  Although it\'s a victory of sorts that </p><p>he is even in Thailand, Hakeem is clearly struggling </p><p>politically.  Despite his best efforts, he has </p><p>not been able to quell the protests that he is not </p><p>attentive enough to the needs of eastern Muslims.  In </p><p>addition, criticism from his many SLMC opponents </p><p>continues to flare.  Although he has seemingly gained an </p><p>edge in the party leadership battle, both sides are </p><p>still heavily involved in litigation and it is not clear </p><p>where the chips will fall.  In the meantime -- and in </p><p>another humbling experience, Hakeem has been forced to </p><p>bite the bullet and accept the three advisers.  Given </p><p>the confluence of events, it seems that Hakeem is well </p><p>on the way to being marginalized unless he does </p><p>something in short order that halts the erosion in his </p><p>support.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>PM Addresses Nation </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) On the evening of January 5, Prime Minister </p><p>Wickremesinghe gave a nationally televised address. </p><p>(Note:  Ref A contains a text of the speech.)  In </p><p>essence, the address was of the "State of the Union"- </p><p>type in which the PM reviewed what he considered his </p><p>coalition\'s major successes of the past year.  Three </p><p>major points emerged:  First, the PM stated that </p><p>the peace process was at a "decisive moment" and that it </p><p>was now time to start making a transition to a permanent </p><p>peace.  Second, he reached out to President Kumaratunga, </p><p>urging her to work with him to make peace possible. </p><p>Third, the PM used part of the speech to underline the </p><p>GSL\'s commitment to economic growth and reform. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) The address received mostly favorable press play </p><p>in papers the next day.  The President\'s Office and her </p><p>People\'s Alliance party had no immediate comment on the </p><p>speech.  As could be expected, the radical JVP party </p><p>harshly criticized it, asserting that the peace process </p><p>was only working in favor of the LTTE.  (Note:  More </p><p>humorously, the JVP also asserted that the PM was wrong </p><p>to wear the "kit of George Bush," i.e., a coat and tie, </p><p>during the speech, and not local dress.)  Asked for his </p><p>reaction to the speech, Jehan Perera, the head of the </p><p>National Peace Council, a local think-tank, commented </p><p>that he thought the speech was constructive in that it </p><p>was "conciliatory" toward the president, which was </p><p>positive in terms of easing cohabitation strains. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) COMMENT:  Although their peace initiative has </p><p>been amazingly successful, one area where the PM and his </p><p>government have been criticized is with respect to </p><p>public relations.  Despite much advice, the PM and his </p><p>major advisers have not taken to the airwaves in any </p><p>sustained way to explain the peace process and solidify </p><p>support for the GSL\'s efforts.  The lack of such an </p><p>effort has not been too much of a problem thus far, but </p><p>could be in the future if the process hits bumps in the </p><p>road.  Wickremesinghe\'s speech seemed to go a way toward </p><p>helping plug the public relations gap, but it is still </p><p>not clear whether it will be part of a longer-term </p><p>effort.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>Visit of Japanese FM </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (SBU) Japanese Foreign Minister Yoriko Kawaguchi </p><p>visited Sri Lanka, January 5-7.  In Colombo, Kawaguchi </p><p>met with President Kumaratunga, the Prime Minister, and </p><p>Foreign Minister Fernando.  She also visited the war- </p><p>ravaged Jaffna area.  While in Jaffna, she promised </p><p>augmented Japanese rehabilitation assistance, including </p><p>funding for demining.  Noting that it was the first </p><p>visit by a Japanese FM to Sri Lanka in 16 years, Koji </p><p>Yagi, a Japanese Embassy poloff, told us that the trip </p><p>went extremely well.  He added that a key area of focus </p><p>in GSL-GOJ discussions during the visit involved a </p><p>review of modalities for the Sri Lanka donor conference </p><p>being hosted by the Japanese government in the June </p><p>timeframe. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) COMMENT:  Japan has been trying to play a more </p><p>important role in Sri Lanka\'s peace process for some </p><p>time and Kawaguchi\'s visit fits into that mold.  One </p><p>aspect of the visit that received significant local </p><p>coverage centered on comments by Hatsuhisa Takashima, an </p><p>assistant of Kawaguchi\'s, who was quoted as repeatedly </p><p>assuring press conference participants that Kawaguchi </p><p>will carefully brief the GoI on the results of her visit </p><p>to Sri Lanka (India is her next stop).  In very </p><p>solicitous remarks, Takashima went on to add that the </p><p>GoJ would ask India for its views about an invitation </p><p>Special Envoy Yasushi Akashi had received from the LTTE </p><p>inviting him to visit areas under its control.  (Note: </p><p>Per Reftels:  According to various sources, the Indian </p><p>government has not welcomed Japan\'s attempts to enhance </p><p>its involvement in Sri Lanka-related issues.)  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
