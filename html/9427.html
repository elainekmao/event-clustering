<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 04 GUATEMALA 001815 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR WHA/CEN; G/TIP:GREG HOLLIDAY; CA/VO AND CA/FPP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ELAB, PHUM, SMIG, PREL, ASEC, KSEP, KFRD, CA, CVIS, GT </p><p>SUBJECT: BILATERAL TIP WORKING GROUP FORMED </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 193839 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary:  In response to RefTel, on July 7, the </p><p>Ambassador and visiting G/TIP Program Officer Greg Holliday </p><p>met with an inter-governmental group including the Minister </p><p>of Government, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Vice </p><p>Minister of Labor, Secretary of Social Welfare, a Supreme </p><p>Court magistrate and other GOG officials to share the </p><p>Department\'s 2003 Trafficking in Persons (TIP) report </p><p>findings and to request stepped-up GOG collaboration to </p><p>combat trafficking in persons.  GOG participants described </p><p>ongoing efforts to combat trafficking and alien smuggling and </p><p>announced the formation of a GOG commission to follow-up on </p><p>issues included in the TIP report.  The Embassy plans to </p><p>follow-up on this result by developing and implementing a </p><p>comprehensive anti-TIP strategy and continuing to encourage </p><p>GOG attention to this issue.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Background </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) G/TIP Program Officer Greg Holliday visited Guatemala </p><p>July 7-9 and met with the Embassy\'s anti-TIP working group, </p><p>the GOG, locally-based NGOs and IOs working on anti-TIP, and </p><p>visited NGO victims assistance projects on the </p><p>Guatemalan-Mexican border at Tecun Uman.  Holliday also met </p><p>with Embassy NAS staff and the GOG\'s Secretary of Social </p><p>Welfare to discuss the results of an earlier G/TIP-funded </p><p>project; met with the main opposition candidate\'s campaign </p><p>advisor on social issues; discussed USG anti-TIP efforts with </p><p>participants in a Vital Voices leadership workshop; and gave </p><p>an interview to the leading daily "Prensa Libre." </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) Guatemala is rated a Tier II country in the </p><p>Department\'s 2003 TIP report.  The GOG acknowledges TIP as a </p><p>growing problem and is taking steps to combat it.   The </p><p>Embassy organized the bilateral meeting to take advantage of </p><p>Holliday\'s visit and the publication of the TIP report to </p><p>increase GOG understanding of and will to combat trafficking </p><p>in persons. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) The GOG responded enthusiastically to our request to </p><p>the MFA for an inter-governmental meeting on this subject. </p><p>Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Gabriel Aguilera hosted the </p><p>meeting, and the following GOG officials attended: </p><p> </p><p>-- Supreme Court Magistrate Napoleon Gutierrez </p><p>-- Minister of Government Dr. Jose Adolfo Reyes Calderon </p><p>-- Minister of Public Health and Social Assistance Dr. Julio </p><p>Molina Aviles </p><p>-- Vice Minister of Labor Sandra Mendez de Arevalo </p><p>-- Secretary of Social Welfare Marilys Barrientos de Estrada </p><p>-- Director General of Migration, Oscar Contreras Hernandez </p><p>-- MFA Director of Bilateral Affairs, Sara Solis Castaneda </p><p>-- MFA Human Rights Advisor Mario Rene Cifuentes </p><p> </p><p>The Ambassador and Mr. Holliday were accompanied by Acting </p><p>PolCouns (Embassy TIP Coordinator) and PolIntern. </p><p> </p><p>USG Pitch </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) The Ambassador acknowledged that trafficking in </p><p>persons is a serious problem in the U.S., and appealed for </p><p>GOG cooperation to fight this scourge.  He explained the </p><p>difference between trafficking in persons and alien </p><p>smuggling.  Holliday described how the USG is tackling the </p><p>problem in the U.S. domestically (through inter-governmental </p><p>coordination) and abroad.  He explained the findings of the </p><p>TIP report on Guatemala and the implications of a Tier II and </p><p>III rankings.  Holliday described G/TIP and USG programs </p><p>worldwide totaling $55 million in 2002 to combat trafficking, </p><p>and gave examples of means to address prevention, assistance </p><p>to victims, and law enforcement to catch and prosecute </p><p>traffickers. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) Holliday praised Guatemala\'s National Action Plan </p><p>to Combat Sexual Commercial Exploitation of Children and </p><p>Adolescents as a good first step and asked how implementation </p><p>of the plan was proceeding.  He said that governments benefit </p><p>from the expertise of IOs and NGOs working to assist victims </p><p>of trafficking, such as the IOM and ILO and Casa Alianza in </p><p>Central America.  He asked to hear about best practices being </p><p>implemented to combat trafficking in Guatemala, and gave an </p><p>example of a best practice in Nicaragua, where police visit </p><p>schools to increase awareness of children to the risks of </p><p>TIP.  Holliday urged GOG immigration authorities not to treat </p><p>victims of trafficking as illegal migrants.  Instead, victims </p><p>should be interviewed to develop investigations into </p><p>trafficking rings, and provided assistance.  Deportation of </p><p>victims does not solve the problem, he said, if the </p><p>trafficker goes free.  He noted GOG efforts to combat and </p><p>punish corruption and welcomed the start of a bilateral </p><p>dialogue on TIP. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) After hearing the GOG presentations (see below) the </p><p>Ambassador emphasized the need to implement concrete actions </p><p>to combat TIP.  He urged a re-examination of the National </p><p>Action Plan and Guatemalan laws to combat TIP.  Holliday said </p><p>that efforts to combat alien smuggling can be adapted to </p><p>combat TIP.  The hundreds of Guatemalans being deported from </p><p>Mexico every day, for example, could be interviewed by </p><p>Guatemalan authorities to determine if they are victims of </p><p>trafficking. </p><p> </p><p>GOG Presentations:  Confusing TIP with Alien Smuggling </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p>8.  (SBU) DirGen of Immigration Contreras described the </p><p>number of Salvadoran and Honduran undocumented migrants </p><p>deported by Guatemala (36,917 in the first six months of this </p><p>year), the number of people charged with migration crimes </p><p>during that period (54) and the number of buses used to </p><p>transport deportees to their countries.  Contreras said </p><p>President Portillo is concerned about the lack of border </p><p>control and lack of prevention of alien smuggling and </p><p>corruption; he then described GOG efforts to change the </p><p>situation since 2001, including Contreras\' appointment as </p><p>"intervenor" of the Migration Directorate.  117 migration </p><p>officials have been discharged for corruption, nine have been </p><p>charged, and 64 have been subject to disciplinary actions in </p><p>the migration directorate, including some directors of the </p><p>directorate\'s union.  He said that he had received threats </p><p>linked to the case of union corruption. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU) Continuing, Contreras said national Immigration </p><p>Service computer networks have been established where they </p><p>did not exist.  The Directorate is now much better equipped </p><p>to detect false documents and has created a "blacklist," </p><p>including information on terrorists and a national </p><p>immigration database.  The Directorate has received </p><p>assistance from the USG and the governments of Mexico and </p><p>Taiwan to upgrade its capabilities.  The Directorate has </p><p>cooperative relations with many Embassy sections, he said, </p><p>and helped in cases involving the smuggling of 50 Salvadoran </p><p>children to the U.S. and in the arrest of the ringleader </p><p>responsible for 18 recent smuggling deaths in Texas.  He </p><p>cited cooperative efforts and accords with Mexico to </p><p>modernize border crossing posts.  He said that he is willing </p><p>to cooperate with NGOs like Casa Alianza, but said "they </p><p>sometimes exaggerate and criticize our efforts to protect the </p><p>human rights of victims." </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU) In conclusion, Contreras said the Directorate </p><p>cooperates with the MFA on visa matters to avoid corruption </p><p>and said, under orders of the President, there are no </p><p>"political or military appointees in Immigration."  Since </p><p>9/11, the GOG has tightened up immigration procedures across </p><p>the board, he said.  He cited measure taken at the Aurora </p><p>International Airport in Guatemala City to tighten ingress, </p><p>and provided a report entitled "Results of Intervention, </p><p>December 2001-June 2003." </p><p> </p><p>11.  (SBU) MFA Human Rights Advisor Mario Rene Cifuentes said </p><p>the GOG takes the problem of trafficking, which is really a </p><p>modern form of slavery, very seriously.  He proposed that </p><p>this meeting be considered the start of a bilateral process </p><p>or dialogue on TIP.  In a formal presentation, Cifuentes </p><p>described the GOG\'s efforts to address the problem </p><p>bilaterally and regionally, including: </p><p> </p><p>-- the GOG-GOM Bi-national Group on Immigration Issues </p><p> </p><p>-- the GOG-GOM Bi-national Study on Immigration </p><p> </p><p>-- the GOG-GOM Ad Hoc Group on Temporary Agricultural Workers </p><p> </p><p>-- the GOG-GOM High-Level Group on Border Security </p><p> </p><p>-- the GOG-GOM Bi-national Group on Ports and Border Services </p><p> </p><p>-- similar bi-national efforts with El Salvador and </p><p>Honduras </p><p> </p><p>-- the Pilot Project on Temporary Agricultural Workers with </p><p>Canada </p><p> </p><p>-- Guatemala\'s pending request for a trilateral meeting on </p><p>migration between the U.S., Mexico and Guatemala, made at the </p><p>Regional Conference on Migration in Antigua in May 2002. </p><p>(Note:  the Embassy facilitated a meeting of the US, </p><p>Guatemalan and Mexican delegations to the Conference at GOG </p><p>request.  At that time, USdel officials and the Mexicans </p><p>offered to return to Guatemala at a later date to share </p><p>lessons learned from US border control on the US-Mexican </p><p>border, and US-Mexican cooperative efforts to combat alien </p><p>smuggling.  That meeting has not taken place but would </p><p>clearly still be welcomed by the GOG.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>-- the Regional Conference on Migration </p><p> </p><p>-- the Central American Commission of Directors of </p><p>Immigration </p><p> </p><p>Cifuentes then listed international conventions Guatemala is </p><p>party to related to TIP, including: </p><p> </p><p>-- the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking </p><p>in Persons, signed and pending in Congress </p><p> </p><p>-- The UN Convention on Protection of the Rights of Migrant </p><p>Workers and their Families (ratified March 14, 2003) </p><p> </p><p>-- Numerous ILO Conventions, including Convention 182 on the </p><p>Worst Forms of Child Labor </p><p> </p><p>-- the Hague Convention on Adoptions </p><p> </p><p>Finally, Cifuentes described inter-institutional efforts to </p><p>address issues related to TIP, including: </p><p> </p><p>-- the National Immigration Commission </p><p> </p><p>-- the National Commission to Combat Trafficking in Persons </p><p>(formed in June 2003 to follow-up issues identified in the </p><p>Department\'s 2003 TIP report.) </p><p> </p><p>-- the proposed National Commission Against Commercial Sexual </p><p>Exploitation of Children and Adolescents </p><p> </p><p>-- various port and border crossing security commission and </p><p>border consulate meetings </p><p> </p><p>12.  (SBU) Supreme Court justice Gutierrez acknowledged the </p><p>need for new legislation to combat TIP, and said the </p><p>judiciary is developing reforms to strengthen the penal code </p><p>that includes TIP.  He distanced the judiciary from the role </p><p>of public prosecutors, saying the role of the judiciary is to </p><p>judge, not to investigate.  He cited the need for control </p><p>over civil registries to combat undocumented migration, the </p><p>use of mobile courts to try traffickers, and better control </p><p>over the issuance of visas. </p><p> </p><p>Victims Assistance Efforts </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  (SBU) Turning to victims assistance, Immigration </p><p>Director Contreras cited GOG efforts to provide 45 </p><p>recently-apprehended smuggling victims from Ecuador with </p><p>shelter and medicines.  One of Contreras\' assistants added </p><p>that a project exists in cooperation with the IOM to </p><p>interview Guatemalan deportees from Mexico to determine if </p><p>they were victims of trafficking.  Contreras said his </p><p>Directorate has proposed training police in humane treatment </p><p>of victims, will construct a medical clinic for victims, and </p><p>will continue to practice direct repatriation of aliens to </p><p>avoid problems experienced in the past of mistreatment and </p><p>corruption in holding centers. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (SBU) Social Welfare Secretary Barrientos said that </p><p>legislation is pending in Congress to ratify the Trafficking </p><p>in Persons Protocol and also to create a National Commission </p><p>to Combat Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children and </p><p>Adolescents, which would implement the National Action Plan. </p><p>The Commission would be comprised of all GOG institutions </p><p>involved in combating trafficking, as well as NGOs.  The </p><p>Secretariat operates four shelters for child victims of abuse </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>referred by the courts.  Victims of trafficking referred by </p><p>the courts have access to these shelters.  (There are </p><p>currently approximately 100 children in each of these </p><p>shelters and 300 more children in selected private homes, she </p><p>said at a subsequent meeting.)  In 2002, the Secretariat </p><p>assisted 37 victims of trafficking, and in the first six </p><p>months of 2003 there have been 16.  The issue of trafficking </p><p>will be introduced to secondary schools in a 24 hour module, </p><p>and there are plans to extend education efforts to the </p><p>primary level to reach those most vulnerable to becoming TIP </p><p>victims. </p><p> </p><p>15.  (SBU) Health Minister Molina described his Ministry\'s </p><p>efforts to provide health services to migrant workers and </p><p>deportees in three GOG shelters and at the Casa del Migrante </p><p>(an NGO) on the border and in the capital. </p><p> </p><p>16.  (SBU) Vice Minister of Labor Mendez cited Ministry of </p><p>Labor cooperation with the ILO\'s Program To Eradicate Child </p><p>Labor (IPEC) in various sectors, and Ministry programs </p><p>designed to help workers succeed in Guatemala.  She cited a </p><p>new temporary labor pilot project with Canada which will </p><p>provide 100 Guatemalans the opportunity to migrate legally to </p><p>earn money for their families, rather than be trafficked. </p><p>She also described the Ministry\'s role to permit ordered </p><p>temporary migration for Guatemalans to work in Mexico. </p><p> </p><p>Comment and Action Plan </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>17.  (SBU) The assembled group of GOG officials had copies of </p><p>the translated TIP report, which we provided in an earlier </p><p>demarche to MFA, and appeared to be familiar with the </p><p>difference between trafficking and alien smuggling.  Their </p><p>responses, however, described efforts to combat the latter </p><p>more than the former.  While there is obviously substantial </p><p>overlap, we will need to continue to emphasize the need for </p><p>concrete steps focused on trafficking. </p><p> </p><p>18.  (SBU) Nevertheless, we are encouraged by the GOG\'s </p><p>commitment to coordinate its anti-TIP efforts and collaborate </p><p>with us to address this problem.  This is a good first step </p><p>and offers possibilities for future collaboration which we </p><p>hope to capitalize on over the coming year.  By tapping the </p><p>talents of the Embassy\'s anti-TIP agencies we hope to achieve </p><p>concrete progress on the legal regime, law enforcement, </p><p>victims assistance, and public awareness to combat this </p><p>scourge.  For example, the Embassy will help focus Congress </p><p>on ratification of the UN Protocol to Combat TIP.  We will </p><p>press the Public Ministry (the Attorney General was invited, </p><p>but absent at this meeting) to step up investigations of </p><p>trafficking in the border region (where at least two </p><p>convictions of traffickers were reported several years ago). </p><p>The Social Welfare Secretariat\'s shelters, which G/TIP has </p><p>supported in the past, offer a good infrastructure for child </p><p>victims, and the Secretariat has requested our help to create </p><p>a new center in Coatepeque (strategically located on the main </p><p>highway route to Mexico) specially geared to helping </p><p>trafficking victims of all ages.  We will evaluate this </p><p>proposal and report further on these possibilities and others </p><p>under discussion with IO and NGO partners in the fight </p><p>against TIP. </p><p>HAMILTON </p><p></p></div>
