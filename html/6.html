<p>S E C R E T TEHRAN 2077 </p><p> </p><p>Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 30 JUN 2005 </p><p> </p><p>C O R R E C T E D C O P Y ( FIRST PARAGRAPH AND PARA. 2.) </p><p> </p><p>E. O. 11652: GDS </p><p>TAGS: PFOR, IR, PK, XF </p><p>SUBJECT: AUDIENCE WITH SHAH APRIL 5 </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 053670 </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY: AFTER APRIL 5 PRESENTATION OF CREDENTIALS </p><p>EXPECT HAVE PRIVATE CONVERSATION WITH SHAH. I PLAN </p><p>LISTEN BUT IF SUBJECT OF PAKISTAN AND SHAH\' S CONCERNS </p><p>REGARDING US/ USSR NEGOTIATIONS COME UP THIS </p><p>WILL BE GOOD OCCASION TO PASS ON ANY THOUGHTS WE </p><p>HAVE REGARDING PAKISTAN AS BHUTTO ARRIVING TEHRAN </p><p>APRIL 7 AND TO REASSURE SHAH TOTAL ERA OF NEGOTIATION </p><p>WITH MOSCOW DOES NOT IN ANY WAY IMPLY LESSENING OF </p><p>TIES WITH IRAN. END SUMMARY. ACTION REQUESTED: </p><p>IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO HAVE BY OPEN OF BUSINESS APRIL 4 </p><p>SUMMARY OF OUR ECONOMIC AID TO PAKISTAN IN LAST 18 </p><p>MONTHS, HIGHLIGHTS OF RECENTLY REVISED ANNOUNCED ARMS </p><p>POLICY TO PAKISTAN AND ANY OTHER POINTS DEPT OR ISLAMABAD </p><p>THINK USEFUL TO PASS TO SHAH REGARDING BHUTTO VISIT. </p><p> </p><p>1. ON MORNING APRIL 5 I WILL BE PRESENTING MY CREDENTIALS </p><p>TO SHAH. THIS OCCASION TOGETHER WITH SEVERAL OTHER </p><p>AUDIENCES BEING SCHEDULED FOR APRIL DURING VISITS OF </p><p>DEPSEC RUSH AND GENERALS GOODPASTER AND RYAN WILL </p><p>PROVIDE AMPLE OPPORTUNITY TO PUT TO SHAH MESSAGES OR </p><p>THOUGHTS WE MAY HAVE ON: ( A) US/ IRANIAN RELATIONS, </p><p>( B) DEVELOPMENTS IN THIS PART OF THE WORLD AND, ( C) ROLE </p><p>IRAN CAN PLAY IN THESE DEVELOPMENTS TO OUR MUTUAL ADVANTAGE. </p><p> </p><p>2. AT PRESENTATION OF CREDENTIALS CEREMONY SHAH\' S CUSTOM </p><p>IS TO TAKE AMBASSADOR ASIDE AFTER CEREMONIALS FOR PRIVATE </p><p>CONVERSATION. THIS BEING MY FIRST OFFICIAL MEETING </p><p>WITH SHAH AS AMBASSADOR, MY INTENTION IS TO LISTEN TO </p><p>WHAT SHAH HAS TO SAY. I ANTICIPATE SHAH, AS IS HIS CUSTOM, </p><p>WILL TAKE ME ON ONE OF HIS " TOUR D\' HORIZONS". WITH </p><p>BHUTTO EXPECTED IN TOWN APRIL 7, PAKISTAN WILL UNDOUBTEDLY </p><p>COME UP. SHAH WILL PROBABLY CHIDE US FOR NOT HELPING </p><p>BHUTTO ADEQUATELY. IF SO, I PLAN REMIND SHAH OF ALL WE </p><p>HAVE DONE ECONOMICALLY FOR PAKISTAN IN LAST YEAR OR SO </p><p>AND OF RECENT DECISION TO LIFT ARMS EMBARGO ON NILITARY </p><p>ITEMS FROZEN IN PIPELINE SINCE 1971. TO THIS END WOULD </p><p>APPRECIATE HAVING BY MORNING APRIL 4 LOCAL TIME BREAKDOWN </p><p>OF ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE TO PAKISTAN FOR LAST 18 MONTHS AND </p><p>MAIN POINTS OF OUR PRESENT ARMS POLICY TOWARDS PAKISTAN </p><p>AND INDIA. </p><p> </p><p>3. IN ADDITION GIVEN SHAH\' S CLOSE RELATIONS WITH </p><p>BHUTTO AND INFLUENCE ON PAK PRESIDENT, ARE TTHERE ANY </p><p>POINTS REGARDING PAKISTAN WHICH DEPT OR ISLAMABAD THINK </p><p>I COULD USEFULLY PUT TO SHAH FOR HIS TALKS WITH BHUTTO. </p><p> </p><p>4. WE HAVE ALSO NOTED ZAHEDI\' S DESCRIPTION OF SHAH\' S </p><p>CONCERNS, WE BELIEVE THIS TO REFLECT SHAH\' S WORRY OVER </p><p>TREND OF EVENTS IN THIS AREA WHICH HE CONSIDERS HOSTILE </p><p>TO IRANIAN INTERESTS AND HIS NEED FOR PERIODIC REASSURANCE </p><p>THAT HE IS NOT ISOLATED, THAT HE CAN COUNT ON </p><p>CONTINUED US INTEREST IN IRAN AND THAT ANY DETENTE </p><p>ACHIEVED BETWEEN US AND USSR WILL NOT WORK TO IRAN\' S </p><p>DISADVANTAGE. </p><p> </p><p>5. IF SUBJECT COMES UP I PROPOSE MAKE SAME POINTS AS </p><p>DEPSEC RUSH MADE TO ZAHEDI AND ASSURE HIM THAT WE </p><p>HAVE NOT AND WOULD NOT DISCUSS IRAN/ US RELATIONS WITH </p><p>USSR WITHOUT IRAN\' S FULL KNOWLEDGE. </p><p> </p><p>6. FINALLY, AT APPROPRIATE TIME I SHALL MENTION </p><p>PRESIDENT\' S DEEP INTEREST IN HAVING SHAH AND EMPRESS </p><p>PAY OFFICIAL VISIT TO WASHINGTON DURING 1973. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HELMS </p><p></p></div>
