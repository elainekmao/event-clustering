<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 YEKATERINBURG 0156 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, RS </p><p>SUBJECT: THE ROMANOVS: THE FINAL CHAPTER IN YEKATERINBURG </p><p> </p><p>1. ON A SUNNY JULY 16 MORNING, THOUSANDS OF </p><p>YEKATERINBURGERS WAITED IN LINE TO PAY THEIR FINAL </p><p>RESPECTS TO NICHOLAS AND ALEXANDRIA.  EXACTLY EIGHTY </p><p>YEARS BEFORE, ON THE NIGHT OF JULY 16-17, 1918, THE </p><p>ROMANOVS HAD BEEN BRUTALLY MURDERED HERE.  THEIR </p><p>REMAINS NOW LAID IN STATE AT YEKATERINBURG\'S ASCENSION </p><p>CHURCH ACROSS THE STREET FROM THE SITE WHERE THE </p><p>EXECUTIONS HAD BEEN CARRIED OUT.  THE COFFINS OF THE </p><p>TSAR AND TSARITSA WERE DRAPED WITH THE BRIGHT YELLOW </p><p>IMPERIAL STANDARD BEARING THE BLACK DOUBLE-HEADED </p><p>EAGLE CREST.  BEHIND THEM LAID THE COFFINS OF THREE </p><p>GRAND DUCHESSES AND FOUR MEMBERS OF THE ROYAL </p><p>HOUSEHOLD STAFF. </p><p> </p><p>2. AT MIDDAY, THE ASCENSION CHURCH\'S SENIOR PRIEST </p><p>CONDUCTED A MEMORIAL SERVICE: \'WE PRAY FOR THE PEACE </p><p>OF SOULS INNOCENTLY SLAIN AND THEIR NAMES ARE KNOW TO </p><p>THEE, OUR LORD.\'   THE LITURGY WAS SOLEMN AND MODEST, </p><p>A WELCOME CHANGE AFTER YEARS OF UNSEEMLY POLITICAL </p><p>INFIGHTING OVER THE BONES.  GOVERNOR ROSSEL AND THE </p><p>REST OF THE LOCAL POLITICAL ELITE ATTENDED THE </p><p>SERVICE.  THEY WERE JOINED BY THE MINISTER OF CULTURE </p><p>FROM MOSCOW.  THE ONLY CONSPICUOUS ABSENTEES WERE THE </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL REPRESENTATIVE TO SVERDLOVSK OBLAST AND </p><p>YEKATERINBURG\'S ARCHBISHOP.  NO ONE FROM THE ROYAL </p><p>FAMILY WAS PRESENT.  THE MOST SATISFIED PERSON IN THE </p><p>CHURCH WAS ALEKSANDR AVDONIN, WHO WAS WITNESSING A </p><p>CEREMONY THAT HE HAD DREAMT ABOUT FOR YEARS.  AVDONIN </p><p>HAD DISCOVERED THE ROMANOVS\' GRAVESITE NEARLY TWENTY </p><p>YEARS AGO. </p><p> </p><p>3. AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE SERVICE, A MILITARY HONOR </p><p>GUARD CARRIED THE COFFINS FROM THE CHURCH SLOWLY PAST </p><p>THE CROWD TO WAITING VEHICLES.  AS THE LEAD </p><p>PALLBEARERS EMERGED FROM THE CHURCH WITH THE TSAR\'S </p><p>COFFIN, BLACK CLOUDS APPEARED AND A RAINSTORM BEGAN. </p><p>A FEW OLD WOMEN DROPPED TO THEIR KNEES AND CROSSED </p><p>THEMSELVES VIGOROUSLY.  SHORTLY AFTER THE LAST </p><p>COFFIN WAS LOADED AND THE MOTORCADE DEPARTED FOR THE </p><p>AIRPORT, THE RAIN STOPPED.  BY MID-AFTERNOON, THE </p><p>ROMANOVS HAD LEFT YEKATERINBURG FOR THE LAST TIME ON </p><p>THEIR WAY TO INTERMENT IN ST. PETERSBURG. </p><p> </p><p>4. THE SHOW NOW MOVES TO RUSSIA\'S NORTHERN CAPITAL, </p><p>BUT TWO QUESTIONS REMAIN IN YEKATERINBURG: </p><p> </p><p>--WHERE ARE THE REMAINS OF THE OTHER TWO ROYAL FAMILY </p><p>MEMBERS, THE TSAREVICH AND GRAND DUCHESS MARIYA? </p><p> </p><p>--AND HOW SHOULD YEKATERINBURG BEST COMMEMORATE THE </p><p>ROMANOVS\' MEMORY HERE? </p><p> </p><p>ON THE LATTER, THE YEKATERINBURG ARCHDIOCESE AND THE </p><p>OBLAST GOVERNMENT HAVE COMMISSIONED A DESIGN FOR A </p><p>\'CHURCH ON THE BLOOD\' TO BE BUILT ON THE SITE WHERE </p><p>THE ROYAL FAMILY WAS KILLED.  THE FIVE-DOMED CHURCH\'S </p><p>DESIGN IS SUPPOSED TO FOLLOW THE STYLE OF NOVGOROD\'S </p><p>ELEVENTH CENTURY CHURCHES.  CONSTRUCTION COSTS ARE </p><p>ESTIMATED AT USD 4 MILLION.  UNFORTUNATELY, THE NEW </p><p>CHURCH\'S COURTYARD WILL LIKELY BE MARRED BY A </p><p>TASTELESS SCULPTURE OF THE ROYAL FAMILY DESIGNED BY </p><p>YEKATERINBURG\'S VERSION OF TSERETELI. </p><p> </p><p>ON THE FORMER, AVDONIN CLAIMS THAT HE KNOWS WHERE THE </p><p>OTHER TWO CHILDREN WERE BURIED IN 1918.  AT A JULY 15 </p><p>PRESS CONFERENCE, GOVERNOR ROSSEL SAID THAT A SEARCH </p><p>FOR ALEKSEY AND MARIYA WILL BE MOUNTED.  HE HASTENED </p><p>TO ADD THAT, IF THEIR REMAINS ARE FOUND, THEY WILL BE </p><p>BURIED TOGETHER WITH THE REST OF THE FAMILY IN ST. </p><p>PETERSBURG. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>RUSSELL </p><p></p></div>
