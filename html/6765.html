Although </p><p>the demonstrators, virtually all students, reportedly have sought to </p><p>march on the U.S. Embassy, local police have restricted them to the </p><p>downtown area.  The demonstrations, occurring successively on March 23, </p><p>24, and 25, have ranged in number from 100 to 600 people and have laste </p><p>approximately 5 hours each day.  Local press coverage has included </p><p>graphic visuals, perhaps inciting the demonstrators.

However, as the gatherings have </p><p>continued, they have begun to take on a slight anti-government coloring </p><p> Local security officials expect demonstrations to continue, and perhap </p><p>to become more violent, as U.S. forces approach Baghdad.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>STUDENT PROTESTS </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  Four people, including two Djiboutian students and two </p><p>German soldiers, have been injured in anti-war demonstrations occurring </p><p>on the mornings of March 23, 24, and 25.  Local police have restricted </p><p>the demonstrations to the downtown area, using riot control tactics and </p><p>tear gas, although reports suggest that the protestors have sought to </p><p>continue their protests at the U.S. Embassy. The students responded by </p><p>throwing rocks at the police and vandalizing nearby vehicles.  On March </p><p>24, police reportedly fired upon the crowd, injuring two students </p><p>seriously.  The two remain hospitalized in serious condition. In </p><p>addition, U.S. military personnel received a report that two uniformed </p><p>German soldiers were injured as they drove by one of the demonstrations </p><p>in a German military vehicle. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Students report that the initial demonstrations of March 23 </p><p>were the direct result of bulletins posted on the university and high </p><p>school campuses. Students deny that they posted the bulletins themselve </p><p>or of having knowledge of who did so.  Senior FSNs, however, report tha </p><p>they have heard reports that local security forces posted the bulletins </p><p> Opposition unionist and high school teacher Souleiman Djama told ConOf </p><p>that he witnessed clandestine state security personnel posting bulletin </p><p>announcing demonstrations at a local high school. In a conversation wit </p><p>Conoff, Abdirazak Hassan Guedi, the judiciary council to the Minister o </p><p>the Interior, denied these claims, calling them rumor. Security </p><p>field reports indicate that the demonstrations were incited by local </p><p>Muslim clerics. </p><p> </p><p>MEDIA </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) The state-run newspaper "La Nation" gave front page coverage to </p><p>the first of the demonstrations on March 23.  The front page photo in </p><p>the March 24th edition pictured marching students waving Iraqi flags an </p><p>anti-war banners.  The opening line of the adjoining article read... </p><p>"Felt to be unjust and unjustified, the war against Iraq has provoked a </p><p>general outcry in the entire world."  A second cover article on </p><p>the same day titled "The war of images" spoke to the graphic nature of </p><p>the television coverage of the war.  The article specifically addressed </p><p>Al-Jazeera pieces, noting that "The war against Iraq is not as clean as </p><p>we might imagine. Despite the precision of their high technology, smart </p><p>bombs have caused numerous civilian casualties, the number of which can </p><p>only rise after every attack." </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) The fact that the demonstrations were covered in the state-run </p><p>newspaper and television suggests that at least the first demonstration </p><p>was government- sanctioned.  Djibouti is the only Arab League country </p><p>not to experience immediate anti-war demonstrations; thus, it is likely </p><p>that the President believed it necessary to demonstrate popular </p><p>opposition to the war prior to the March 24 Arab League meeting in </p><p>Cairo.  The President made his first critical public statement on March </p><p>24, likely to boost his position in Cairo. He opposes the war in Iraq </p><p>even though he believes there should be regime change, but he </p><p>fears that demonstrations of any kind will also become anti-government </p><p>because of the poor state of the Djiboutian economy. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) The most recent demonstration on March 25th was accompanied </p><p>by a police escort and conducted in a peaceable manner; however, the </p><p>most recent gatherings have begun to take on an anti-government cast. </p><p> Embassy personnel and U.S. military continue to monitor the situation </p><p>around town; all agree that this is only the beginning of what is </p><p>believed will be many more demonstrations to come. Embassy security </p><p>contacts have suggested that, due to the graphic media accounts </p><p>of the war, the potential for violent demonstrations will increase as </p><p>the fighting nears Baghdad. </p><p> </p><p>YAMAMOTO </p><p></p></div>
