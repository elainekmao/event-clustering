<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 ABUJA 002539 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL 08/23/12 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, KDEM, PREL, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA -- FORMER VP EKWUEME SAYS </p><p>PDP IN TURMOIL; PRESIDENTIAL RACE UNCLEAR </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F.JETER; </p><p>                  REASONS 1.5(B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY: During two meetings with </p><p>the Ambassador in late July and mid-August, </p><p>former civilian Vice President and current </p><p>Chairman of the PDP Trustee Board Alex </p><p>Ekwueme waxed about the danger of massive </p><p>defections from the party due to President </p><p>Obasanjo\'s waning popularity. As a result, </p><p>the Trustees established a committee to </p><p>assess Obasanjo\'s electoral chances. Ekwueme </p><p>unconvincingly stated that he did not want </p><p>to be in the running, but thought former </p><p>Head of State Ibrahim Babangida would seek </p><p>the UNPP\'s banner and would present a </p><p>formidable challenge. Former Head of State </p><p>Buhari, seeking the ANPP nomination, was </p><p>popular in the Muslim North but had little </p><p>appeal in other regions and had ostracized </p><p>the Christian community by intemperate </p><p>statements on religion. Perennial also-rans </p><p>such as Umaru Shinkafi were not serious </p><p>contenders, but were jockeying for Cabinet </p><p>positions and other pay-offs. Ekwueme </p><p>predicted that after a few more months of </p><p>backroom bargaining more serious candidates </p><p>would emerge and the real picture of the </p><p>presidential contest would unfold.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>IRE IN THE PDP HOUSE </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) As Chairman of the ruling PDP\'s </p><p>Board of Trustees, Ekwueme should be looking </p><p>forward to the upcoming elections.  Instead, </p><p>Ekwueme, in two separate meetings with the </p><p>Ambassador in late July and mid-August </p><p>respectively, related his discomfort with </p><p>the disunity infecting his party. During </p><p>their most recent meetings, the Trustees </p><p>decried the internecine battles between the </p><p>President and party leadership in the </p><p>National Assembly and despaired over the </p><p>violence and shameless cheating that </p><p>characterized PDP local government primaries </p><p>in July.  Yet the biggest headache was </p><p>President Obasanjo\'s sagging popularity and </p><p>the President\'s now renowned tendentiousness </p><p>which has alienated numbers of party </p><p>members.  Important people were prepared to </p><p>leave the PDP and join other parties, </p><p>particularly if Obasanjo attempted to hijack </p><p>the nomination, Ekwueme said. Because of </p><p>this intra-party power struggle and due to </p><p>the growing perception that Obasanjo might </p><p>be an electoral liability, the Board was </p><p>forming a committee to study the Party\'s </p><p>internal troubles, Ekwueme added. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) COMMENT: Preferring understatement </p><p>and subtlety, the soft-spoken Ekwueme </p><p>generally shuns blunt frankness. What he </p><p>leaves between the lines is as important as </p><p>what he says explicitly. Thus, things may be </p><p>even worse than Ekwueme\'s description of the </p><p>PDP misfortune.  Clearly, Ekwueme holds </p><p>Obasanjo largely responsible for the party\'s </p><p>woes. Because of Obasanjo, the PDP may be </p><p>courting a major decline in its electoral </p><p>fortunes. With Obasanjo steadily sinking, </p><p>Ekwueme and others do not want to be pulled </p><p>down by or because of him. Consequently, the </p><p>committee will assess damage done to the </p><p>party by its self-inflicted internal </p><p>conflicts. In reality, we have learned that </p><p>the real motivation for the committee\'s </p><p>formation was to gauge Obasanjo\'s electoral </p><p>prospects. The formation of the committee </p><p>evinces a diffusion of power within the PDP </p><p>and the democratic freedom to challenge the </p><p>Head of State, a development unprecedented </p><p>in Nigerian politics. However, it also says </p><p>legions about the President\'s diminished </p><p>political stature and the growing </p><p>disenchantment of the PDP leadership with </p><p>Obasanjo. End Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Continuing along this line, </p><p>Obasanjo\'s re-nomination was not a fait </p><p>accompli, Ekwueme told the Ambassador. </p><p>Already there were four other contenders who </p><p>had formally announced their bids for the </p><p>PDP nomination. Ekwueme expected more people </p><p>to contest for the PDP banner, but doubted </p><p>the veracity of rumors that Vice President </p><p>Atiku would leave the ticket to seek the </p><p>nomination in his own right. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL RACE -- THE PICTURE IS CLOUDY </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Looking outside the PDP, Ekwueme </p><p>thought former Head of State Babangida was </p><p>inching closer to a formal declaration.  A </p><p>long-term Babangida associate recently told </p><p>Ekwueme that Babangida would run, Ekwueme </p><p>confided to the Ambassador. Also, </p><p>Babangida\'s men were busy purchasing </p><p>vehicles and other equipment and materials </p><p>in apparent preparation for mounting a </p><p>campaign. He thought IBB would run under the </p><p>banner of the UNPP, political home of </p><p>numerous retired general officers, including </p><p>Admiral Augustus Aikhomu, Babangida\'s </p><p>military Vice-President and subsequent </p><p>political front-man. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Although IBB would probably run, </p><p>Ekwueme believed, the former Head of State </p><p>characteristically was keeping his options </p><p>open. IBB was also still exploring the </p><p>possibility of an Igbo candidate and a </p><p>northern Vice Presidential running mate. </p><p>Many more late night negotiating sessions </p><p>and horse-trading would be required before a </p><p>candidate emerged that could appeal to the </p><p>different segments of the fragmented Igbo </p><p>political elite. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Being a former Vice President and a </p><p>still widely respected figure, the urbane </p><p>Ekwueme would fit the bill; however, he </p><p>doubted Babangida would seek him out to </p><p>forge common cause. After masterminding the </p><p>coup that toppled Shagari and Ekwueme in </p><p>1983, and later using his political muscle </p><p>and riches to snatch the PDP Presidential </p><p>nomination from Ekwueme\'s grasp to hand it </p><p>to Obasanjo in 1999, Babangida saw Ekwueme </p><p>as an aggrieved adversary who might seek </p><p>vengeance. While professing no ill will </p><p>toward the former Head of State, Ekwueme </p><p>thought IBB would always be wary of him. </p><p>Instead, Babangida was looking at Igbos like </p><p>Senator Ike Nwachukwu, a former general and </p><p>Babangida\'s Foreign Minister. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) In the ANPP, former military strong- </p><p>man Muhammadu Buhari currently was the man </p><p>to watch. However, Buhari\'s strident and </p><p>divisive religious statements had made most </p><p>Christians and many moderate Muslims cringe. </p><p>While Buhari was popular with the young, </p><p>poor and restive in the Muslim community, he </p><p>could not pay one Northern Christian to vote </p><p>for him, Ekwueme declared. Obasanjo </p><p>benefited the longer Buhari, a regional and </p><p>religious lighting rod, remained a serious </p><p>candidate. Buhari would split the anti- </p><p>Obasanjo vote in the North while forcing the </p><p>Northern Christian and Southern vote, both </p><p>anti-Christian and Muslim, to unite and </p><p>gravitate to Obasanjo. Ekwueme did not </p><p>consider other announced candidates such as </p><p>perennial also-ran Umaru Shinkafi as </p><p>presidential timbre.  He thought Shinkafi </p><p>and others had entered the race in order to </p><p>raise their visibility and leverage that </p><p>visibility to gain Cabinet posts and/or </p><p>other future pay-offs. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) While discussion of the relative </p><p>strengths of Obasanjo, Babangida and Buhari </p><p>was interesting, Ekwueme cautioned that the </p><p>list of presidential candidates was not </p><p>static. In Nigeria\'s political culture, </p><p>presidential candidates emerge primarily </p><p>from the closed door bargaining among the </p><p>leaders of the political elite. The one who </p><p>announces his candidacy early and publicly </p><p>is rarely the one left standing when the </p><p>backroom political trade-offs are over.  The </p><p>most serious candidates usually emerge later </p><p>in the game.  While Obasanjo and the two </p><p>other former military Heads of State are the </p><p>most serious names right now, Ekwueme </p><p>predicted that the really formidable </p><p>contenders among the civilian politicians </p><p>would not emerge until December, when all of </p><p>the political bartering has been done and </p><p>the secret electoral compacts sealed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Although he felt Babangida would </p><p>enter the UNPP, Ekwueme felt IBB\'s hand also </p><p>was in the NDP and, to a lesser degree, the </p><p>ANPP. He did not see IBB\'s hand in the APGA </p><p>as others thought, but acknowledged that </p><p>some of the APGA hierarchy made their </p><p>fortunes during IBB\'s reign. Ekwueme was not </p><p>surprised the APGA was registered as a </p><p>national party by INEC even though parties </p><p>fielded by more widely known politicians </p><p>could not fulfill the geographic </p><p>requirements of having field offices in 24 </p><p>states. The APGA\'s ability to meet this </p><p>requirement had little to do with manifest </p><p>national character or being a party of </p><p>ethnic   diversity; instead, the APGA relied </p><p>on the wide diffusion of Igbos throughout </p><p>Nigeria. Igbos are in every state and you </p><p>can find an Igbo trader in almost every </p><p>village. Thus, the APGA simply used these </p><p>Igbo outposts as the address for their field </p><p>offices in the various states. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) Ekwueme stated that the larger </p><p>number of opposition parties generally </p><p>favored the PDP and Obasanjo. He predicted </p><p>that an integral part of Obasanjo\'s </p><p>political strategy would be to clandestinely </p><p>promote minor opposition candidates in order </p><p>to prevent a unified opposition around one </p><p>candidate. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) Asked when the PDP convention would </p><p>occur, Ekwueme thought it would not take </p><p>place in October as originally slated. He </p><p>noted that the National Executive Committee </p><p>and the Board of Trustees had to finalize </p><p>the guidelines for the party primaries for </p><p>the state and national offices and for the </p><p>election of delegates to the primaries prior </p><p>to establishing the date for the convention. </p><p>Therefore, it was highly unlikely that the </p><p>convention would take place before December. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) Ekwueme lamented the confused status </p><p>of the local government elections, saying </p><p>that the machinations that have delayed them </p><p>set a discordant, unfortunate precedent for </p><p>the state and national polls ahead. He </p><p>remembered the PDP trustees had advised </p><p>Obasanjo last year that he would rue the </p><p>decision to extend the tenure of the local </p><p>government councils. However, Obasanjo was </p><p>fixated on having his own independent </p><p>political constituency by making sure the </p><p>PDP could take the local governments in his </p><p>home state away from the Yoruba-dominated </p><p>Alliance for Democracy (AD). Obasanjo </p><p>thought he could accomplish this feat if </p><p>given more time, but he was wrong. Now, with </p><p>his popularity dramatically declining, the </p><p>President is afraid of holding local </p><p>elections prior to the party convention. He </p><p>does not want to limp into the convention </p><p>having again lost his local government area </p><p>and with the PDP possibly suffering a net </p><p>loss nationwide. That would be the closest </p><p>thing to a vote of no confidence that would </p><p>make the convention an untidy, and open </p><p>affair. Thus, Ekwueme predicted that local </p><p>government elections would not hold until a </p><p>month after the PDP convention. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) While he could not completely mask </p><p>his ambition, Ekwueme disclaimed any </p><p>intention to seek the presidency. He said </p><p>that he would be abroad, and thus out of the </p><p>picture, most of August and September when </p><p>much of the horse-trading would be done. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15. (C) The exceptionally intelligent and </p><p>experienced Ekwuewe may have been a bit </p><p>disingenuous regarding his own ambitions. He </p><p>has come close before and clearly he thinks </p><p>he can do a better job than the man </p><p>currently at the helm. Yet, Ekwueme is </p><p>caught in the bind of being in the same </p><p>party as Obasanjo. If he openly attacked </p><p>Obasanjo, he would be accused of disloyalty </p><p>and seeking self-vindication. However, </p><p>Ekwueme would not mind too much should </p><p>others continue fustigating the President. </p><p>By absenting himself during this potential </p><p>gathering storm within the PDP, he can watch </p><p>on the sidelines as things unfold, thus </p><p>averting blame from Obasanjo\'s friends and </p><p>foes. While a longshot, Ekwueme is probably </p><p>trying to position himself as an elder </p><p>statesman who could reconcile both camps in </p><p>the party should Obasanjo\'s renomination bid </p><p>fail. Given the fluidity and </p><p>unpredictability of Nigerian politics, </p><p>Ekweume could indeed be a political dark </p><p>horse; certainly, he would serve, if called. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15. (C) Ekwueme\'s views on the rest of the </p><p>Presidential candidates are insightful. </p><p>While Obasanjo, Babangida and Buhari are the </p><p>big three now, it is almost inevitable that </p><p>other names will emerge who will be serious </p><p>contenders.  We are hearing this refrain </p><p>more and more. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
