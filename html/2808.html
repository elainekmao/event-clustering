<p>UNCLAS HARARE 000966 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>AF/PD FOR COX AND ROBERTSON, AF/S FOR KRAFT AND </p><p>SCHLACHTER, AF/RA, INR/R/MR, NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ZI, PREL, PHUM </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REPORT ZIM TURNS 22; HARARE </p><p> </p><p>1.   Under headline "Forget about Mugabe\'s peace," the </p><p>   independent weekly "The Standard" dedicated its </p><p>   April 21 editorial to criticizing Robert Mugabe\'s </p><p>   for preaching but not practicing.  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>2.   "Robert Mugabe\'s hypocrisy continues to be </p><p>   exposed </p><p>   every time he addresses the nation.  Despite the </p><p>   fact that Zimbabweans and the world are well aware </p><p>   of his brutal dictatorial tendencies, Mugabe </p><p>   nevertheless vainly tries to portray himself as a </p><p>   unifying dove of peace.  His address at Thursday\'s </p><p>   Independence Day celebrations exposed this double </p><p>   standard.  Well aware of the political turmoil </p><p>   besetting Zimbabwe, Mugabe delivered a speech laden </p><p>   with the gospel of peace and political tolerance. . </p><p>   .  Unfortunately it comes too late.  Over 120 </p><p>   opposition supporters have been killed by his </p><p>   followers since the referendum.  His tone in recent </p><p>   years has been one of hate, bitterness and </p><p>   division.  In fact he has successfully divided this </p><p>   nation in order to rule it. . .  Mugabe\'s legacy of </p><p>   hate and division hangs over the country like a </p><p>   dark cloud." </p><p> </p><p>WHITEHEAD </p><p></p></div>
