A. KATHMANDU 228 </p><p>     B. B. KATHMANDU 170 </p><p>     C. C. STATE 16356 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Michael E. Malinowski for reasons 1.5 (d). </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p>======= </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) On February 13, Nepal\'s Secretary of Foreign </p><p>Affairs briefed international donors on the agreement reached </p><p>between Nepal and Bhutan on verification of Bhutanese </p><p>refugees.  The Government of Nepal (GoN) and participating </p><p>donors were openly skeptical of the agreement, pointing out </p><p>the lack of technical detail and a timeline.  Nepal has asked </p><p>for continued pressure on Bhutan to make good on its </p><p>commitments.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>The Minstry of Foreign Affairs Holds Donor Meeting </p><p>============================================= ===== </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) On Febraury 13, Nepal\'s Secretary of Foreign Affairs, </p><p>Madhu Raman Acharya, briefed donors on the agreement between </p><p>the Government of Bhutan (GoB) and GoN reached last week. </p><p>Also present and participating was outgoing Joint Secretary </p><p>for South Asia Gyan Chandra Acharya. Representatives from the </p><p>European Union, European donors, Australia, Japan, and the </p><p>U.S. were present, with India notably absent.  Secretary </p><p>Acharya confirmed that the GoN and GoB had harmonized </p><p>positions on the four categories of refugees (Ref A).  The </p><p>GoN provided some valuable additional detail on the </p><p>agreement, including GoN\'s opinion of the result. </p><p> </p><p>The Agreement </p><p>============= </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Secretary Acharya hailed the GoN/GoB agreement as a </p><p>breakthrough.  He emphasized the fact the agreement was put </p><p>into writing and signed by government representatives.  When </p><p>questioned, the Secretary declined to share a copy of the </p><p>agreement unless the GoB assented or there is a breach of its </p><p>terms.  (Comment: Subsequently, the DCM learned from the </p><p>German Ambassador that the Secretary would be willing to </p><p>provide a copy in private.  End comment.)  During the GoB/GoN </p><p>ministerial-level discussions, the parties established </p><p>guidelines on documentation and established assurances that </p><p>families would not be separated during the categorization </p><p>process. However, when donors pressed for details, Acharya </p><p>could provide very little substance. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) After the Secretary\'s brief statement, donors </p><p>questioned the need for four categories, in light of the </p><p>GoB\'s commitment to accept all those willing to return who </p><p>were Bhutanese.  Joint Secretary Acharya replied that in </p><p>accepting Bhutan\'s four categories, the GoN provided Bhutan </p><p>with a face-saving measure--allowing the GoB to place more </p><p>refugees into the voluntary category rather than the </p><p>forcefully expatriated category.  Donors confirmed that the </p><p>agreement did not address the restitution of property or </p><p>compensation to repatriated refugees.  When the GoN was </p><p>confronted with the real possibility that this might affect </p><p>refugees\' willingness to return, the Secretary stated that </p><p>the position of the GoN will depend on the numbers of </p><p>Bhutanese unwilling to return. </p><p> </p><p>Timeline </p><p>======== </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) No timeline for repatriation was established in the </p><p>agreement, although Secretary Acharya hopes that refugees </p><p>will begin to leave the camps by the second half of this </p><p>year.  The parties agreed to deploy the Joint Verification </p><p>Team (JVT) to Bhutan on Febraury 24 to review the </p><p>verification documents of the Khundunabari Camp.  Secretary </p><p>Acharya anticipates 3-4 weeks for the team to complete </p><p>categorization based on the documents.  He confirmed that an </p><p>additional ministerial meeting will be held in Thimpu on </p><p>March 24 to address any issues and move forward on </p><p>repatriating the first camp.  The Secretary sees no reason </p><p>why additional camps could not be verified during initial </p><p>repatriation, although this point was not part of the </p><p>agreement. </p><p> </p><p>GoN and Donor Skepticism </p><p>======================== </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) The Secretary and Joint Secretary demonstrated </p><p>obvious skepticism on the prospects for Bhutanese </p><p>repatriation.  Secretary Acharya bordered on the undiplomatic </p><p>in stating, "An agreement with Bhutan that is not in writing </p><p>is not an agreement."  He also expects frustration on all </p><p>sides with likely delays in implementation.  Participating </p><p>donors echoed the GoN\'s doubt.  The Secretary echoed the </p><p>Foreign Minister\'s comment that the GoN will measure </p><p>Bhutanese sincerity by the results of the Joint Verification </p><p>Team--how many does Bhutan ultimately take back (Ref B). </p><p>Acharya requested the international community to continue to </p><p>encourage (rephrased to "pressure" in private) Bhutan to turn </p><p>deeds into actions. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>======= </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) The agreement, while a notable step, lacks sufficient </p><p>detail to provide complete assurance of Bhutan\'s intentions. </p><p>Donors\' questions were met with ambiguous replies by the </p><p>Secretary, who placed much emphasis on the March 24 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>ministerial to resolve any remaining problems.  The efforts </p><p>of the international community to encourage Bhutan to follow </p><p>through could well be critical to the ultimate resettlement </p><p>of the over 100,000 refugees.  The upcoming conference in </p><p>Geneva would provide an exceptional opportunity for donors to </p><p>pin the GoB down on specific timelines, conditions, and </p><p>compensation (Ref C). </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
