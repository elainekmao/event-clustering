(SBU) Summary.  On December 19, the Board of Directors </p><p>for the State-owned electricity company ENEE announced the </p><p>annulment of the bid for a 210 MW electricity contract.  In </p><p>announcing the annulment, the Board said that the various </p><p>legal challenges presented by bidders to the decision to </p><p>award the contract to Honduran energy company Lufussa could </p><p>tie up the bid process in the courts for years and lead to a </p><p>potential national energy crisis.  The annulment moves the </p><p>decision on what to do with the contract to the Council of </p><p>Ministers which met early on December 20 to discuss options. </p><p>AES\' local representative (protect) reported to the Embassy </p><p>rumors that the ministers are leaning to signing a direct </p><p>contract with AES for the 210 MW.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) On December 19, the Board of Directors for the State- </p><p>owned electricity company ENEE unanimously agreed to annul </p><p>the public tender for a 210 MW electricity contract.  In a </p><p>press conference, the President of the ENEE Board of </p><p>Directors, Minister of Natural Resources Patricia Panting, </p><p>remarked that the decision to annul the bid was taken to </p><p>avoid a prolonged case in the court over the challenges to </p><p>the decision to award the 210 MW contract to Honduran energy </p><p>company Lufussa.  The Board feared that the legal challenges </p><p>to the bid decision would tie up the bid contract in the </p><p>courts for years and impede the creation of new energy </p><p>capacity to meet Honduras\' energy needs beginning in 2004. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) On November 26, AES, Comercial Laeisz and the </p><p>National Engineers group all challenged the results of the </p><p>bid, arguing that Lufussa should have been disqualified for </p><p>failing to include sufficient transmission facilities in its </p><p>original bid offer (ref e). </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) In annulling the bid process, the ENEE Board of </p><p>Directors has put the responsibility of taking a decision on </p><p>the 210 MW contract in the hands of the Council of Ministers </p><p>which met early on December 20 to discuss options.  AES\' </p><p>local representative reported to the Embassy that he has </p><p>heard rumors from various sources that the Council of </p><p>Ministers is leaning toward arranging a direct contract with </p><p>AES for the 210 MW.  Another option is to redo the entire </p><p>bid process.  Given the urgency in meeting Honduras\' energy </p><p>needs beginning in 2004, it seems unlikely that the GOH </p><p>would embark on another public tender for the 210 MW. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) Minister Panting reiterated that the bid process was </p><p>clean and transparent and that the annulment was not related </p><p>to any irregularities in awarding the contract to Lufussa. </p><p>ENEE Director Angelo Botazzi echoed Minister Panting\'s </p><p>remarks on the transparency of the process and stated that </p><p>it is in the best interest of the country to avoid a </p><p>prolonged legal battle in the courts which could leave </p><p>Honduras without new energy capacity in 2004.  Botazzi </p><p>warned of a potential energy crisis and alluded to the </p><p>energy crisis of 1994, when the government\'s program to </p><p>ration electricity led to prolonged blackouts across </p><p>Honduras. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Embassy has continuously advocated for AES to </p><p>receive fair treatment during the bid process.  Post is </p><p>pleased that the GOH annulled the contract with Lufussa and </p><p>would welcome a GOH decision to award the contract to AES, </p><p>but notes that if this were to happen there would likely be </p><p>negative public reaction by some interested parties. </p><p> </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
