REASON:  1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  The polarization between the Palace-appointed </p><p>interim government and mainstream political parties </p><p>continues.  Nepali Congress President and former Prime </p><p>Minister G.P. Koirala, who maintains that the previous </p><p>Parliament should be reinstated, led a rally November 26 </p><p>against the King\'s October 4 dismissal of the previous </p><p>government.  More such demonstrations may be likely. </p><p>Hardliners within the Nepali Congress are urging against </p><p>compromise with the Palace, according to a high-ranking party </p><p>source, who expressed concern that Koirala\'s continued </p><p>intransigence--and thus a protracted stalemate between the </p><p>parties and the Palace--could play right into the plans of </p><p>the Maoists.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>PARTIES STILL SITTING OUT ON THE SIDELINES </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  Despite the November 18 Cabinet expansion (Ref A), </p><p>no one from any of the seven Parliamentary parties--with the </p><p>exception of the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister </p><p>themselves--has accepted a position in the interim government </p><p>appointed by the King October 11.  (Note:  Ref A incorrectly </p><p>reported that Land Reform Minister Badri Narayan Basnet is a </p><p>member of the National Democratic Party.  In fact, Basnet is </p><p>a former member of the Nepali Congress.  End note.)  Party </p><p>activists on either side of the aisle lament that the King is </p><p>trying to prove he can go it alone without the parties, </p><p>claiming the monarch is heeding too attentively the views of </p><p>recitivist Palace insiders who paint all politicians as </p><p>corrupt, ineffectual, self-interested hacks.  Interim </p><p>government efforts to accomplish what successive democratic </p><p>governments could not--i.e., dealing with the Maoists and </p><p>cleaning up corruption--thus garner suspicion, rather than </p><p>support, from party leaders who feel themselves increasingly </p><p>sidelined and rendered superfluous by the King. Many are </p><p>particularly alarmed by the anti-corruption crusade (Ref C), </p><p>interpreting it as another Palace ploy to discredit the </p><p>democratic parties\' legacy.  (Note:  For some politicians, </p><p>their personal levels of culpability in assorted scandals </p><p>likely also figure prominently in these feelings of disquiet. </p><p> End note.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  At the same time, some party leaders appear jealous </p><p>of the new government\'s efforts to reopen talks with the </p><p>Maoists and may, according to some sources, be actively </p><p>attempting to thwart such overtures.  One </p><p>politician-cum-human rights activist alleged recently that NC </p><p>leader G.P. Koirala actually is urging the Maoists, </p><p>apparently through his own human rights channel, not to open </p><p>talks with the "illegitimate" interim government appointed by </p><p>the King. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  But despite their displeasure with the King\'s move, </p><p>the parties still appear clearly perplexed about how best to </p><p>respond.  The positions of the National Democratic Party and </p><p>the Nepal Sadbhavana Party (the third- and fourth-largest </p><p>parties respectively) are particularly sensitive, since the </p><p>current Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister hail from </p><p>their respective upper ranks.  One Nepal Sadbhavana Central </p><p>Committee member told us his party was acutely displeased </p><p>when Badri Mandal, their acting President, accepted the post </p><p>of Deputy PM--a step taken, according to the source, with no </p><p>prior clearance from the party leadership.  The National </p><p>Democratic Party, or Rastriya Prajatantra Party (RPP), </p><p>although traditionally allied with the Palace, has still </p><p>avoided nominating anyone (with the exception of PM Lokendra </p><p>Bahadur Chand) to the Cabinet.  Communist Party of Nepal - </p><p>United Marxist Leninist (UML) leader Madhav Nepal seems to be </p><p>quietly sitting on the fence, neither directly confronting or </p><p>criticizing the King nor explicitly endorsing his action. </p><p>The UML has so far shown a reluctance to engage in street </p><p>demonstrations, although a mass meeting is planned to be held </p><p>in Kathmandu Dec. 13.  UML leader Nepal has intimated that </p><p>his party would like the King to replace the current </p><p>technocrat Cabinet and Prime Minister with an all-party </p><p>government (and a PM yet to be named), and may have deferred </p><p>public displays thus far in the hope of pursuing "quiet </p><p>diplomacy" with the King.  So far, however, the Palace has </p><p>given no indication that it is entertaining any suggested </p><p>revisions to the Cabinet. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>KOIRALA OUT IN FRONT AGAIN </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  But if the UML, the RPP, and the Nepal Sadbhavana </p><p>are downplaying, at least for now, their displeasure with the </p><p>current set-up, the Nepali Congress Party, under the quixotic </p><p>leadership of five-time PM G.P. Koirala, shows no such </p><p>reticence.  The 79-year-old Koirala has kept up a steady </p><p>chorus of dissent, charging the King\'s dismissal of the </p><p>previous government was "unconstitutional," and warning </p><p>darkly of unspecified dangers to democracy posed by the </p><p>interim government.  On November 26, the Nepali Congress held </p><p>concurrent mass rallies in eight different cities across the </p><p>country; another rally was held in a ninth location just a </p><p>few days later.  With the exception of the rally in Pokhara, </p><p>each of the rallies was fairly well-attended, according to NC </p><p>spokesman Arjun Narasingh K.C., with the Kathmandu meeting, </p><p>addressed by none other than G.P. himself, drawing thousands </p><p>of participants.  Some of the attendees carried banners and </p><p>signs criticizing the King\'s October 4 dismissal of the </p><p>previous government.  Koirala was somewhat more circumspect </p><p>in his public remarks, avoiding direct criticism of the </p><p>monarch, suggesting instead that the King "take corrective </p><p>measures" by reinstating the Parliament dissolved last May. </p><p>(Note:  November 29 editions of Nepali dailies quoted Koirala </p><p>as warning that his party might support withdraw its support </p><p>of the constitutional monarchy in favor of a republic absent </p><p>ameliorative measures taken by the King.  The NC Party </p><p>spokesman told poloff the former PM once again had--as is </p><p>apparently so often the case--been misquoted.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>MAOISTS INTO THE MIX? </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Koirala\'s strong words against the monarch have won </p><p>him admiration and kudos from an unlikely quarter--the </p><p>Maoists--who have praised him as the one true democrat brave </p><p>enough to stand up to the King.  (Needless to say, a complete </p><p>reversal of their view of him during his tenures as Prime </p><p>Minister.)  NC spokesman Narasingh K.C. told us he fears that </p><p>Koirala may be increasingly distancing himself from the </p><p>political mainstream with his harsh rhetoric, boxing himself </p><p>more and more into a corner that will leave him little room </p><p>for maneuvering.  Self-interested opportunists within his own </p><p>party are counseling against moderation and compromise, </p><p>urging him to insist on the reinstatement of the previous </p><p>Parliament--a proposal which enjoys the dubious distinction </p><p>of having been rejected by all other parties and the King--as </p><p>his bottom line (a line which has no resonance among the </p><p>people, either).  The Maoists, who thrive on contention and </p><p>discord among domestic political forces to further their own </p><p>aims, are also encouraging a hard line, spokesman K.C. said. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  Narasingh K.C. said he had attended an all-party </p><p>meeting November 28 called by a far-left coalition (some with </p><p>covert links to the Maoists) that had gained no seats in the </p><p>previous Parliament.  The left-wing parties tried to convince </p><p>the Nepali Congress and UML representatives (the only </p><p>mainstream parties in attendance) to participate in mass, </p><p>all-party demonstrations and protests against the King\'s </p><p>action.  Neither the UML representative nor he agreed to the </p><p>proposal, Narasingh K.C. said.  If they did, he observed, the </p><p>agenda could be easily hijacked by the Maoists.  We are </p><p>getting "dragged to the Maoists\' side" by the political </p><p>impasse, he complained, since there seems to be little </p><p>latitude left for compromise and understanding between the </p><p>Palace and the NC. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) In a December 3 meeting with UML Central Committee </p><p>member and former Deputy Prime Minister Bamdev Gautam, the </p><p>Ambassador encouraged the political parties to work together </p><p>with the Palace to present a united front against the </p><p>Maoists, adopting as a basic principle that the insurgents </p><p>cease their violent activities.  The Ambassador also warned </p><p>that security forces are fearful the Maoists might try to </p><p>infiltrate street demonstrations and mass rallies planned by </p><p>the parties, in a bid either to discredit the mainstream </p><p>political parties or to provoke an over-reaction from the </p><p>Government.  Gautam said he recognized this danger.  He </p><p>reiterated the UML position calling for an all-party </p><p>government, perhaps formed under the auspices of Clause 128 </p><p>of the Constitution, but noted that there had been no further </p><p>discussion between the Palace and his party for the past two </p><p>weeks. (Note:  Clause 128 authorized the formation of the </p><p>first interim Cabinet "consisting of representatives from the </p><p>main political parties," before national elections could be </p><p>held, under democracy.  UML logic holds that since elections </p><p>cannot be held because of security conditions, Clause 128 </p><p>offers a constitutional precedent for forming an all-party </p><p>interim government until the situation improves and national </p><p>elections can be held.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) It is a little disheartening to reflect that the </p><p>Nepali Congress can mobilize its party machinery to rally </p><p>thousands of people in Kathmandu and elsewhere to protest the </p><p>King\'s action but seems unable to organize a program of </p><p>similar magnitude denouncing Maoist attacks against their own </p><p>party workers in the field, or against the frequent </p><p>Maoist-called general strikes that are so debilitating to the </p><p>economy and society.  The current impasse is absorbing most, </p><p>if not all, of the interim government\'s attention.  Asserting </p><p>its legitimacy is distracting this government from addressing </p><p>more urgent matters--like the insurgency--in much the same </p><p>way fending off the constant threats of no-confidence votes </p><p>and party splits had preoccupied previous governments.  So </p><p>far, however, creative resolutions to the stalemate have not </p><p>been forthcoming.  Reinstating the previous Parliament </p><p>appears to have the support of no one save G.P. Koirala, does </p><p>not appear to have any constitutional basis, and would likely </p><p>face a Supreme Court challenge.  (Note:  The Supreme Court </p><p>has already ruled the dissolution of Parliament in May to be </p><p>legal.  End note.)   Given the perennial contentiousness of </p><p>Nepali party politics, the all-party government proposed by </p><p>the UML would seem to have too many moving parts to prove </p><p>workable.  That said, an interim government in a multi-party </p><p>democracy--even one formed with the best intentions--should </p><p>be able to demonstrate some support from some of those </p><p>parties as a minimum requirement.  If that government is </p><p>facing a violent insurgency that claims to have broad-based </p><p>popularity, that support becomes even more crucial.  Without </p><p>it, this government will remain severely restricted in what, </p><p>if anything, it can accomplish toward a long-lasting solution </p><p>to the conflict.  We, along with the British, have quietly </p><p>been advising both the Palace and the political leaders to </p><p>compromise on their public postures, which are becoming </p><p>increasingly inflexible, to achieve a government that more </p><p>accurately represents the multi-party democracy it seeks to </p><p>preserve.  Unfortunately, however,  dialogue between the </p><p>parties on the Palace on a more feasible ruling formula, </p><p>e.g., a reshuffled Cabinet, which combines qualified </p><p>technocrats with representatives from all the Parliamentary </p><p>parties, seems for the moment to be at a standstill.  End </p><p>comment. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
