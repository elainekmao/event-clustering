<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 003641 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE PASS USTR FOR NED SAUMS </p><p>COMMERCE FOR 4520/ITA/MAC/ONE/PTHANOS </p><p>STATE PASS USAID FOR MSCOVILL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, EINV, ELAB, IS, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: AQABA AUTHORITIES HOST QIZ PROGRAM </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (u)  Aqaba Chief Commissioner Akel Biltaji hosted a group </p><p>of some 50 QIZ exporters and park managers for a two-day </p><p>program in the Special Economic Zone to tout improved port </p><p>services and to sell the Aqaba International Industrial </p><p>Estate as an investment option.  Participants were pleased </p><p>with the program, which reinforced some good news about </p><p>improvements to lead-times for door-to-door shipment from </p><p>QIZ\'s to the U.S. via Aqaba.  The program also raised </p><p>questions, though, about choices the Aqaba Special Economic </p><p>Zone Authority has made to accommodate expatriate labor in an </p><p>effort to attract foreign investment.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>AQABA QIZ PROGRAM JUNE 26-27 </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (u)  Akel Biltaji, Chief Commissioner of the Aqaba </p><p>Special Economic Zone Authority (ASEZA), hosted a two-day </p><p>program in Aqaba at the end of June for QIZ exporters and QIZ </p><p>park managers.  The aim of the program, which received </p><p>extensive support from the USAID-funded Jordan-US Business </p><p>Partnership (JUSBP), was twofold:  first, to expose QIZ </p><p>exporters to the services offered by the Port of Aqaba and </p><p>recent and planned improvements to port services; and second, </p><p>to encourage exporters to invest in the Aqaba International </p><p>Industrial Estate, a QIZ-qualified light industrial park </p><p>built with USAID assistance and slated to begin operation at </p><p>the end of 2002.  Representatives from all of Jordan\'s main </p><p>QIZ parks attended, along with several of their clients. </p><p>Also in attendance were representatives of local and </p><p>international shipping lines. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>SPOTLIGHT ON PORT, ASEZA ADVANTAGES </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (u)  Port Director Saud Soror highlighted strong, </p><p>consistent growth in port business in recent years in a </p><p>presentation on day one.  He noted in particular a 16% </p><p>increase in container transshipment through the port in the </p><p>first quarter of 2002, and further noted that the increased </p><p>volume coincided with fewer ship visits - an indicator that </p><p>larger container ships are now using Aqaba, a good growth </p><p>sign.  Soror also highlighted improvements to port </p><p>infrastructure totaling $10-12 million in the past 2-3 years, </p><p>in particular the addition of a third gantry crane that has </p><p>significantly decreased lead times to be on par with </p><p>international standards and lowering freight costs for </p><p>importers and exporters. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (u)  A day two presentation by ASEZA representatives </p><p>highlighted the business advantages offered in the ASEZ.  The </p><p>ASEZA reps promised quicker business registration times, </p><p>streamlined customs operations, and expediting for visa </p><p>applications.  More importantly for the assembled QIZ </p><p>exporters, they highlighted fast turnaround times for work </p><p>permits for laborers employed in the zone, and lower permit </p><p>fees compared to the rest of Jordan.  ASEZA reps also noted </p><p>regulations in the zone allow an investor to draw up to 70% </p><p>of its labor force from overseas, with the further promise </p><p>that, if an investor found he needed a higher percentage, </p><p>"come to us, we\'re flexible." </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>LEAD TIMES IMPROVING </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (u)  Perhaps the most important presentation for QIZ </p><p>operators, though, was a lengthy discussion of door-to-door </p><p>shipping times through both Aqaba and Haifa.  During the </p><p>presentation, agents for both Maersk and APL confirmed a </p><p>long-term commitment to shipping through Aqaba and said they </p><p>were working hard to reduce lead times from Aqaba to New York </p><p>through the use of larger, more frequently scheduled feeder </p><p>vessels.  The Maersk rep said the company had already added </p><p>four new feeders from Aqaba to Salala, had instituted </p><p>fixed-day sailing from Aqaba, and had just opened a field </p><p>office in Amman.  The APL rep noted the company was looking </p><p>at establishing a feeder route through Genoa, which could cut </p><p>3-5 days off current shipping times. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (u)  Local shipping magnate Amin Kawar told a surprised </p><p>assemblage that door-to-door shipping times from QIZ\'s to New </p><p>York through Haifa and through Aqaba are reaching parity.  He </p><p>attributed this to long overland shipping times from the QIZ </p><p>parks to Haifa, which he said average 7-8 days.  By </p><p>comparison, the trip from factory to boat in Aqaba might take </p><p>as little as 2-3 days.  With overland transportation reforms </p><p>being finalized by the GOJ (according to Biltaji), transit </p><p>times from QIZ to Aqaba could be cut to one day.  These </p><p>improvements could easily make up the current difference of </p><p>11-16 days between using Haifa and using Aqaba.  With lead </p><p>times converging, most exporters agreed Aqaba, at up to </p><p>$1,000 less per container to ship ($1500-$1700, versus $2500 </p><p>per container through Haifa) would become a more desirable </p><p>shipping point almost overnight.  Kawar told us on the </p><p>margins of the conference that, in fact, some 40% of QIZ </p><p>exports already used Aqaba as the primary shipping port - 80 </p><p>containers per week, versus 100 per week through Haifa. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (u)  The increasing frequency with which Aqaba is being </p><p>used as an export point for QIZ containers is good news.  It </p><p>means more jobs for Jordanian truckers and for Jordanian </p><p>dockworkers, and provides an incentive for Aqaba authorities </p><p>to continue their commitment to smoothing port operations. </p><p>The bad news is, no one knows Aqaba is already so widely </p><p>used.  The general consensus is that Haifa is still </p><p>overwhelmingly the port of choice for QIZ exporters.  This </p><p>serves to reinforce unenlightened arguments among economic </p><p>conservatives that the QIZ initiative provides no real </p><p>benefits to Jordan - jobs go to the Chinese, profits go to </p><p>foreign investors, and containers go to Haifa.  We will </p><p>continue to work with the GOJ, local chambers of industry, </p><p>and the sector to get the facts out. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (sbu)  Of more concern in the long run are the labor </p><p>incentives ASEZA advertises to foreign investors.  Offering </p><p>cheaper, faster work permits to larger percentages of foreign </p><p>workers runs counter to ASEZA\'s long-term strategy for </p><p>creating jobs for residents in poor neighborhoods of Aqaba </p><p>and Ma\'an.  These incentives are not likely to lead to </p><p>relocation of existing QIZ\'s in Jordan, due to investment </p><p>perqs that are available in Jordan proper but not in Aqaba. </p><p>They will prove a disincentive to hire local labor, though, </p><p>until the GOJ shows a stronger commitment to demand-driven </p><p>skills training for Jordanians, or until the GOJ starts </p><p>focusing its investment promotion efforts on responsible </p><p>companies that show a long-term commitment to the kingdom and </p><p>to worker training.  USAID is working with the GOJ to develop </p><p>such a skills training program targeting Jordanian workers in </p><p>the textile sector. </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
