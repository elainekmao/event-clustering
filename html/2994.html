<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 002587 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/21/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, KPAL, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDANIANS ASK FOR U.S. HELP IN FACILITATING </p><p>TRANSIT OF DONATION FROM KING TO JERUSALEM HOSPITAL </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Amb. Edward W. Gnehm for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  In a meeting with Ambassador and PolCouns May 20, </p><p>Prime Minister Ali Abul Ragheb stressed the need for U.S. </p><p>intervention to improve the "humanitarian situation" in </p><p>Palestinian areas of the West Bank, Jerusalem, and Gaza. </p><p>Israel has recently made it more difficult for humanitarian </p><p>supplies from Jordan to reach their destinations in the West </p><p>Bank, he claimed.  For example, he said, Israel has held up </p><p>for more than two weeks a personal donation of medical </p><p>supplies from King Abdullah to the Makassad Hospital in </p><p>Jerusalem.  He asked if the U.S. could intervene with Israel </p><p>to assure delivery of the supplies. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  He also complained that the pervasive Israeli </p><p>checkpoints in the West Bank have humiliated the Palestinian </p><p>population and brought normal life and economic activity to a </p><p>halt.  He complained that al-Quds University has been unable </p><p>to pay salaries to its teachers, but that Jordan had agreed </p><p>to pay the salaries until the situation improves. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  We know that Embassy Tel Aviv and ConGen Jerusalem </p><p>have worked tirelessly to facilitate humanitarian efforts. </p><p>Is there anything that Embassy Tel Aviv can do to help </p><p>persuade the Israelis to allow delivery of King Abdullah\'s </p><p>personal contribution to Makassad? </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
