<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 002277 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA AND SA/INS; NSC FOR E. MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  12-10-12 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, PINS, PHUM, CE, LTTE - Peace Process, Political Parties </p><p>SUBJECT:  As leadership dispute flares, Sri Lanka\'s </p><p>major Muslim party marginalized in peace process debate </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  Colombo 2267, and previous </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Lewis Amselem, Deputy Chief of </p><p>Mission.  Reasons 1.5 (b, d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  Dissension within the Sri Lanka Muslim </p><p>Congress (SLMC) continues to tear the party apart.  The </p><p>two sides vying for leadership of the SLMC have taken </p><p>their increasingly fractious battle to court and to the </p><p>press.  Initial fears that the SLMC\'s internal turmoil </p><p>would have a detrimental impact on the governing </p><p>coalition\'s stability and the peace process have proven </p><p>to be unfounded, thus far.  Rather, the primary effect </p><p>of the turmoil appears to be the self-marginalization of </p><p>the Muslim voice in the peace process debate.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Legal Maneuvering.  Dissension in the SLMC </p><p>continues to tear the principal Muslim party in Sri </p><p>Lanka apart.  The most recent upsurge in tensions began </p><p>on December 1 when dissidents led by SLMC MPs A.L.M. </p><p>Athaulla and M. Hafrath acted to remove Rauf Hakeem as </p><p>party leader -- See Reftel.  After it became clear that </p><p>both sides were not going to give in, the conflict moved </p><p>to the courts and on December 3 a Colombo court granted </p><p>an injunction request filed by the SLMC dissidents that </p><p>effectively suspended Hakeem as leader of the party.  At </p><p>this point, Hakeem seemed to be on the way out.  After </p><p>rushing back from Oslo (where he had been participating </p><p>in the third session of GSL-Tamil Tiger talks), Hakeem </p><p>made a comeback however.  In response to a countersuit </p><p>filed by Hakeem\'s camp, an appeals court overruled the </p><p>initial decision and Hakeem was back as SLMC leader.  On </p><p>December 13, another Colombo court is scheduled to hold </p><p>hearings to determine who the leader of the SLMC is.  In </p><p>the meantime, Hakeem is claiming that the dissidents </p><p>have been expelled from the party. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Battling in the Press.  Aside from the legal </p><p>jousting, the two sides have increasingly taken their </p><p>struggle to the press.  Barely a day goes by without </p><p>front-page articles highlighting the dueling press </p><p>conferences put on by the two sides.  Articles have </p><p>cited the two camps as making the following shrill </p><p>attacks: </p><p> </p><p>-- Hakeem has stated that the charges against him "are </p><p>only a pretext for certain self-serving people who are </p><p>bringing puerile arguments to get privileges and </p><p>benefits for themselves at the expense of the </p><p>community\'s long-term interest." </p><p> </p><p>-- Hakeem has also stated that the rebels in the SLMC </p><p>are trying to "destabilize the government and the peace </p><p>process." </p><p> </p><p>-- Athaulla on Hakeem: "He has a tendency of threatening </p><p>anybody who bravely indicated his stupidity." </p><p> </p><p>-- Hafrath: "The party at present is in the hands of </p><p>sincere and honest workers.  Several attempts have been </p><p>made in not so pleasant terms to undo the stability of </p><p>the party by certain elements." </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Ramifications for GSL and Peace Process.  Initial </p><p>fears that the turmoil within the SLMC would have a </p><p>detrimental impact on the governing coalition\'s </p><p>stability (the SLMC is a key part of the United National </p><p>Front coalition) and the peace process have proven to be </p><p>unfounded, thus far.  Although five of the 12 SLMC MPs </p><p>seem to be anti-Hakeem at this point, and the governing </p><p>coalition only holds a slim majority in Parliament, the </p><p>GSL is benefiting from the tacit support of the 16 MPs </p><p>loyal to the Tamil National Alliance (TNA).  The TNA\'s </p><p>support gives the GSL a significant cushion in </p><p>Parliament and, as of yet, there is little sign that the </p><p>government is close to falling or that it might lose any </p><p>tight votes.  In any case, although some observers </p><p>believe that they are in cahoots with the People\'s </p><p>Alliance (PA) opposition, the dissidents have indicated </p><p>that they would not abandon the government for now.  At </p><p>the same time, while they have made some anti-peace </p><p>process statements, the dissidents have not focused </p><p>their fire on the government\'s peace initiative.  As of </p><p>this point, their favorite target is Hakeem and what </p><p>they see as his abuse of power in running the SLMC -- </p><p>not the peace process. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) COMMENT:  The primary effect of the intra-SLMC </p><p>turmoil appears to be the self-marginalization of the </p><p>Muslim voice in the peace process debate.  When Hakeem </p><p>was forced to withdraw from the Oslo talks, Muslims lost </p><p>their direct voice in the negotiations.  In addition, </p><p>with the two sides so busy attacking each other, Muslims </p><p>have not fielded a coherent reaction to the Tigers\' </p><p>recent announcement that they would explore federalism </p><p>options "in areas of historical habitation of the Tamil- </p><p>speaking people" (See Reftels).  Although Muslims as </p><p>Tamil speakers are included within the ambit of this </p><p>construct, there is no sign that they are prepared to </p><p>join the debate on federalism soon.  This, despite the </p><p>fact that any decisions taken on this issue could have a </p><p>significant impact on the large community of Muslims in </p><p>the east.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
