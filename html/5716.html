<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 000974 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/09/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PHUM, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: HR ACTIVIST PREDICTS FUTURE PROTESTS WILL BE </p><p>PEACEFUL; "TRANSFER" ISSUE BIGGEST POTENTIAL FLASHPOINT </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. AMMAN 745 </p><p> </p><p>     B. AMMAN 6521 (2002) </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: CHARGE D\'AFFAIRS GREGORY L. BERRY.  REASONS: 1.5 (b) and </p><p> (d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  SUMMARY.  On February 9, PolOff met with long-time </p><p>human rights contact Fawzi Samhoury, who has close contact </p><p>with the IAF and professional associations.  Samhoury expects </p><p>upcoming demonstrations planned by opposition leaders </p><p>protesting possible military action against Iraq to remain </p><p>peaceful.  He commented that the Jan 31 "anti-war" </p><p>demonstration in Shmeisani (reftel A) was less "Pro-Saddam" </p><p>than it appeared.  Among Jordanians likely to participate in </p><p>forthcoming demonstrations, Samhoury claims demonstrators are </p><p>most upset with the lack of parliamentary elections and the </p><p>slower-than-expected pace of democratic reforms.  Samhoury </p><p>also noted a growing frustration towards Arab leaders for </p><p>failing to deal with the issue of Saddam.  He believes </p><p>transfer of Palestinians from the West Bank (expected by some </p><p>in the wake of military action in Iraq) is the one </p><p>"flash-point" that could possibly ignite the street.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  Samhoury said Islamic Action Front/Muslim </p><p>Brotherhood leaders told him they will try to "motivate" </p><p>Jordanians to demonstrate as a possible war approaches. </p><p>According to Samhoury, in the last demonstration organizers </p><p>did not provide transportation for people living outside of </p><p>Amman for fear their busses would be stopped by security </p><p>services.  The result was attendance of less than 3,000.  In </p><p>forthcoming demonstrations, such as one planned for February </p><p>15, Samhoury said he expects the organizers to step up </p><p>efforts to increase crowd sizes.  The organizers also will </p><p>likely attempt to plan demonstrations outside of Amman in the </p><p>near future as well.  Samhoury said protest organizers are </p><p>cooperating well with the GOJ and are "committed" to keeping </p><p>the demonstrations peaceful.  He believes this cooperation is </p><p>sustainable for at least the near-term. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) NOTE: On February 9, the IAF called on Jordanians </p><p>to participate in a one hour "black-out" on February 14 at </p><p>20:00 in an effort to "stop the war."  The IAF\'s statement </p><p>was typically vitriolic, describing US and British troops </p><p>massing in the region as "wolves," but called on Jordanians </p><p>to take non-violent actions, such as turning off the lights </p><p>and televisions in their homes, lighting candles and praying </p><p>for God to "keep the predators away." END NOTE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Although the January 31 demonstration was billed as </p><p>"anti-war," Samhoury said the participants were privately (if </p><p>not vocally) most upset about the lack of a parliament and </p><p>democratic reform.  In general, demonstrators expressed their </p><p>strong support for the opposition.  Samhoury said many people </p><p>were also upset with regional Arab leaders for failing to </p><p>avert the current Iraq crisis (note: this view was also </p><p>reported to us by public affairs contacts). </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  Samhoury is optimistic rallies will remain peaceful. </p><p> He believes Jordanians, although frustrated, will not take </p><p>to the streets in the event of an attack on Iraq.  "Only if </p><p>the Israelis try to transfer Palestinians from the West Bank </p><p>into Jordan or kill large numbers of Palestinians could </p><p>things go out of control.  Transfer is the worst thing in the </p><p>minds of people here, it will be worse for them than seeing </p><p>Iraqi civilians killed on TV."  Samhoury commented that the </p><p>USG would do well to make a push, "whatever you are able," </p><p>to spur Israeli-Palestinian peace efforts forward. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) NOTE AND COMMENT.  Samhoury is still proceeding with </p><p>his court case to have the Jordan Society for Citizens\' </p><p>Rights reinstated (reftel B).  Notwithstanding the </p><p>dissolution of the JSCR, Samhoury is still in contact with </p><p>human rights activists and demonstration organizers.  His </p><p>view tracks with what many here are telling us:  While some </p><p>Jordanians may occasionally hoist a pro-Saddam placard in </p><p>order to express frustration with the US, they are most </p><p>concerned about the possibility of Israeli actions in the </p><p>West Bank following military action in Iraq. </p><p>BERRY </p><p></p></div>
