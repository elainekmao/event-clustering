END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Dr. Sani A. Sufi, Secretary of the Judicial Commission </p><p>of Inquiry on the inter-communal conflict in Benue, Taraba, </p><p>Nassarawa and Plateau States April 15 briefed PolCouns and </p><p>PolMilOff on the Commission.  Sufi is a civil servant who is </p><p>concurrently Secretary of the Commission and Director of </p><p>Administration at the Ministry of Defense. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>====================== </p><p>THE DELAYS APPEAR OVER </p><p>====================== </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Sufi noted that while the Commission was announced </p><p>late last year, its inauguration took until March. The delay </p><p>was because the body was constituted as a full-fledged </p><p>judicial commission; arrangements had to be made with the </p><p>Supreme Court for the provision of bailiffs, court reporters </p><p>and other judicial support staff.  Because of the nature of </p><p>the Commission, the presiding officer had to be a well-known </p><p>jurist.  The Ministry of Justice also had to second two </p><p>prosecutors to work full time with the Commission. </p><p>Allocation of funds was difficult and time-consuming as well, </p><p>Sufi admitted.  Additionally, the Federal Government engaged </p><p>in informal consultations with the four states in question, </p><p>asking each state to either present the name of an indigene </p><p>it wanted on the commission or to comment on names proposed </p><p>by the federal government.  While these consultations took </p><p>time, they assured that the states would be more comfortable </p><p>about the make-up and the deliberations of the group.  The </p><p>four other members of the panel were chosen from among </p><p>Nigeria\'s corps of distinguished, retired civil servants. </p><p>These four were selected for their overall knowledge of </p><p>government and Nigeria.  Not from any of the affected states, </p><p>this quartet was selected to bring significant expertise and </p><p>greater objectivity to the Commission. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>   4. (U) The Commission Chairman is Justice Chukwuemeka </p><p>Opene, the Presiding Judge of the Federal Court of Appeal, a </p><p>highly respected jurist.  The other eight members include </p><p>Alhaji Mohammed Liman, Micleans Dikwal, Daniel Agogo, Alhaji </p><p>Haruna Ahmadu, Ambassador Yahaya Abdullahi, Alhaji Yahaya </p><p>Hamza, Chief Patrick Okon, and Ruth Akafa. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>============= </p><p>THE GAME PLAN </p><p>============= </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) The Commission\'s formal terms of reference include: 1) </p><p>Examining the proximate causes of the conflicts between </p><p>communities in the four states; 2) Identifying the basic </p><p>issues underlying tension between communities and providing </p><p>strategies for peace; 3) Identifying groups and individuals </p><p>involved in the crises; 4) Recommending appropriate </p><p>sanctions; 5) Examining the roles of states and local </p><p>governments and traditional authorities; 6) Providing </p><p>recommendations to improve existing security arrangements; </p><p>and 7) Providing recommendations on other measures to secure </p><p>peace and facilitate reconciliation between communities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) According to Sufi, the body will have the power to </p><p>summon witnesses and compel testimony. Sufi stated the </p><p>Commission will not only investigate the Benue tragedy but </p><p>also incidents of communal conflict in the other states as </p><p>well.  Stressing the Commission\'s judicial quality, Sufi </p><p>mentioned the panel was not limited to trying to reconcile </p><p>the disputant ethnic groups. The Commission would have the </p><p>authority to investigate any criminal act within the scope of </p><p>its mandate.  While not empowered to conduct criminal </p><p>proceedings itself, the Commission was expected to recommend </p><p>to the federal government, via the Justice Ministry, </p><p>appropriate criminal indictments for "anyone" identified as </p><p>having committed criminal acts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) The Commission has already collected 37 written </p><p>submissions from interested parties.  Sufi expected the </p><p>Commission to receive many more. The Commission would </p><p>actively solicit contributions from important individuals, </p><p>such as traditional rulers and local community leaders, who </p><p>might not be well-versed in the functions of a judicial </p><p>commission but whose input would be important to furnishing </p><p>the Commission with an accurate picture of the problems in </p><p>the affected areas.  Sufi stated that the Commission not only </p><p>anticipated receipt of reports averring particular incidents </p><p>of abuse or violence but more far-reaching submissions </p><p>offering policy suggestions to curb the conflicts.  He said </p><p>the Commission would ask institutions, such as the Institute </p><p>for Peace and Conflict Resolution and the National Institute </p><p>for Policy and Strategic Studies, to provide such position </p><p>papers. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Sufi commented that he had reviewed the Human Rights </p><p>Watch report on the Benue massacre.  He did not think the </p><p>Commission would actively seek contributions from HRW or </p><p>other international human rights groups.  He maintained that </p><p>the HRW report was based primarily on work done by Nigerian </p><p>groups.  The commission already had received reports from </p><p>several domestic human rights organs.  The Commission would </p><p>request submissions directly from other local groups whose </p><p>work that helped informed the HRW report but who had not yet </p><p>provided any report to the Commission, he emphasized. </p><p>9. (C) The GON had not placed any time limits on the panel\'s </p><p>investigative mandate, giving the body wide latitude </p><p>regarding how far it wanted to dig into the past history of </p><p>these conflicts.  Sufi remarked that many of these conflicts </p><p>had been brewing for decades.  The panel might have to dig </p><p>relatively deep to appropriately understand some of these </p><p>conflicts and to provide suggestions to the GON on resolving </p><p>these quarrels. The Federal Government also had not set a </p><p>timeframe for the Commission to finish its work, preferring </p><p>the body take the time needed to get the job done, Sufi </p><p>opined.   He expected that shortly after the group reconvened </p><p>April 29, they would begin their public work.  Sufi said the </p><p>Commission was contemplating holding public hearings for </p><p>approximately one week in each of the states. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) After the visits to the states, the group would </p><p>return to Abuja to digest the information gathered on the </p><p>four-state circuit ride and then continue public sittings </p><p>here.  The public hearings in Abuja would allow groups not </p><p>heard in the states to present evidence and would give the </p><p>Commission an opportunity to summon persons and organizations </p><p>implicated in criminal acts to present testimony.  These </p><p>people and groups would be afforded the right of counsel at </p><p>the hearings.  Sufi hoped the hearings in the states would </p><p>begin in May.  He did not know how long the hearings in Abuja </p><p>might take.  However, once they were finished, the Commission </p><p>would promptly present a report to the President. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) After expressing some frustration over the earlier </p><p>delay in getting the Commission\'s judicial support and </p><p>resources from the Supreme Court, Sufi voiced optimism that </p><p>the body would be effective and fulfill its terms of </p><p>reference.  He noted that the members selected made for a </p><p>"good composition," and he clearly held Justice Opene in </p><p>esteem.  He also praised Minister of State for Army </p><p>Batagarawa\'s efforts to help furnish much-needed logistical </p><p>support for the Commission. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) COMMENT: Nigerian judicial commissions have a history </p><p>of being very deliberate in their proceedings.  However, </p><p>Batagarawa clearly understands the importance that we attach </p><p>to the efficacy and impartiality of this tribunal in </p><p>promoting the rule of law and investigating what happened in </p><p>Benue last October (and in the other states before and </p><p>after).  While in a perfect world, we would have preferred </p><p>that Sufi have no ties to the Ministry of Defense, this is </p><p>not a perfect place, and his connections to the Ministry </p><p>might facilitate a level of cooperation that might not </p><p>otherwise exist.  We will sustain contact with Sufi and </p><p>monitor the Commission to make sure the link to the Ministry </p><p>does not have a corrosive impact on the panel\'s independence. </p><p> END COMMENT. </p><p>Andrews </p><p></p></div>
