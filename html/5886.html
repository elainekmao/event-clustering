<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 GUATEMALA 000473 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/19/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, EAID, PINS, ETRD, ELAB, KDEM, PINR, GT </p><p>SUBJECT: PROTESTS IN FINAL YEAR OF PORTILLO ADMINISTRATION </p><p>RAISE SPECTER OF DECLINING GOVERNABILITY </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Officer Erik Hall. Reason 1.5 (b&d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary:  Portillo\'s virtual absence from public </p><p>during a time of mounting social protests has led to growing </p><p>concern about governability.  The latest challenges, from </p><p>teachers, ex-PACs and the "campesinos," are not easily </p><p>attributed to Portillo\'s traditional opponents in the private </p><p>sector, and the GOG has few resources to address their </p><p>demands.  Bloody prison riots fuel public concerns that the </p><p>GOG may be abdicating its responsibility for security, as the </p><p>prisons were left in the hands of the mutinous prisoners.  As </p><p>election campaigning begins, Guatemalans are concerned about </p><p>the growing potential for confrontation and the lack of </p><p>effective action by the Portillo Administration to resolve </p><p>the conflicts.  One GOG official expressed concern that </p><p>governability could decline this year as popular demands grow </p><p>and the GOG either cannot or will not address them.  It is </p><p>important that monitoring of the election begin early so that </p><p>social tensions do not negatively impact on the transparency </p><p>of the electoral process. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Portillo Faces Growing Challenges in Final Year </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>2. (C) President Portillo is facing growing pressure from his </p><p>traditional populist base as he enters the final year of his </p><p>presidency.  His agreement in 2002 to negotiate with former </p><p>civil patrol members (ex-PACs) a compensation package for </p><p>their service during the internal conflict led other social </p><p>sectors to compete for the same potential GOG funds.  Public </p><p>school teachers, an important electoral base of any sitting </p><p>government, have been on strike for over six weeks seeking a </p><p>40% pay increase, and "campesino" groups demanding land are </p><p>increasingly marching in Guatemala City and blocking roads in </p><p>the countryside.  Portillo\'s reaction so far has been to let </p><p>his ministers talk with the protesters without making </p><p>commitments, but Portillo himself has been out of the public </p><p>eye for almost a month.  He surfaced in Panama for a recent </p><p>meeting of Central American presidents with Colombian </p><p>President Uribe, but other than that has not appeared in </p><p>public and has not spoken to the press.  He even recruited </p><p>Attorney General Carlos de Leon (constitutionally not a </p><p>member of the executive) to give a nationally televised </p><p>speech calling, on behalf of the President, for the avoidance </p><p>of violence in the protests.  Portillo\'s virtual absence has </p><p>led to much perhaps exaggerated press speculation that </p><p>Portillo is increasingly disengaging from the day to day </p><p>issues of governance and that governability will continue to </p><p>deteriorate in this final year of his administration. </p><p> </p><p>Teachers and Campesinos Drawing Closer </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) As the national teachers strike (an unofficial work </p><p>stoppage rather than a legally sanctioned strike) entered its </p><p>sixth week on February 17, police and military MPs cordoned </p><p>off key government buildings, but could not prevent </p><p>occupation by protesters.  The striking teachers number more </p><p>than 80,000 nationwide, and on January 30 and February 12 </p><p>turned out 20-40,000 in the capital -- the largest popular </p><p>protests in recent history.  On February 17, teachers agreed, </p><p>after mediation by Church leaders, to leave the occupied </p><p>Finance Ministry and restart dialogue with the Ministers of </p><p>Labor, Education, and Finance over their demands for more </p><p>funds for education, but the dialogue so far has not produced </p><p>the outlines of a solution.  Finance Minister Weymann told us </p><p>that the GOG does not have the funds to back up its original </p><p>offer of 100 Quetzales (approximately $13) a month pay </p><p>increase for the teachers (which the teachers rejected), and </p><p>said that giving in to the teachers would lead other public </p><p>sector workers to ask for similar increases which would </p><p>"break the bank." </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Meanwhile, campesino groups and organized labor have </p><p>voiced sympathy for the teachers, and talks between the two </p><p>groups were announced for February 18.  Nery Barrios, head of </p><p>the UASP union confederation which includes the striking </p><p>teachers and the major campesino federation, told the </p><p>Ambassador on February 13 that direct action (meaning </p><p>unsanctioned strikes and street-level protest) are the only </p><p>means available to workers to counter fruitless dialogue with </p><p>the GOG.  Jose Pinzon, leader of the other major labor </p><p>federation, the Union of Guatemalan Workers (UGT), said </p><p>workers are disillusioned by electoral politics, where </p><p>"(political candidates) run (for office) for the people, but </p><p>govern for their financial backers." </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) GOG Peace Commissioner Catalina Soberanis told </p><p>reporters on February 17 that the GOG had completed its </p><p>census of ex-PACs and had determined that 600,000 people were </p><p>eligible for compensation.  There has been no significant </p><p>movement, however, on funding a compensation package for the </p><p>former civil patrol members or the widows and orphans from </p><p>the internal conflict. </p><p> </p><p>Prison Riots Go Unchecked </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Even as Guatemalans wonder how the GOG is going to </p><p>address the growing social demands, two bloody riots at local </p><p>prisons have left many concerned that the GOG is not </p><p>fulfilling its responsibility to keep order and impose the </p><p>law.  The latest in a series of prison riots, which occurred </p><p>on February 12, left seven dead at the capital\'s preventive </p><p>detention facility, including the convicted murderer of </p><p>Monsignor Gerardi.  Reports that prisoners were playing </p><p>soccer with the decapitated heads of rival prisoners in full </p><p>view of the guards left most Guatemalans numbed.  News of </p><p>this gruesome event set off rumors of GOG intentions to use </p><p>the riot as an excuse to declare a "state of exception or </p><p>siege."  Guatemalans were deeply disturbed by the </p><p>Government\'s inability or unwillingness to impose order in </p><p>the two prisons that were now under the control of the </p><p>mutinous prisoners.  The prison riots coincide with an </p><p>alarming rise in violent crime that affects all Guatemalans, </p><p>but especially the poor, and has led some commentators to </p><p>question whether the Portillo Administration is increasingly </p><p>abdicating its role to provide effective citizen security. </p><p> </p><p>One GOG Insider Concerned About Lack of Response to Protests </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) The continuing social tensions and the lack of </p><p>effective GOG response has some concerned within the GOG as </p><p>well.  New Secretary for Strategic Analysis Arturo Montenegro </p><p>confided to us privately his misgivings about the </p><p>determination among Portillo Administration hard-liners, </p><p>especially Vice President Reyes Lopez, to meet growing social </p><p>and political opposition to the government with confrontation </p><p>or total inaction. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Montenegro believes that the teacher\'s strike has the </p><p>potential to become a bigger problem for the GOG.  He is </p><p>concerned that it is only a matter of time before the </p><p>ex-PAC\'s begin pressuring the government as well, and said </p><p>the government doesn\'t have any solution to offer.  Instead, </p><p>he said, the GOG was seriously considering firing the </p><p>teachers, adding fuel to the fire.  Election pressures will </p><p>make every possible group surface demanding resources from </p><p>the government.  Meanwhile, he said, the GOG is broke, and </p><p>cannot honor any promises it makes.  In addition, the crime </p><p>situation is fast getting out of hand and no one has a </p><p>solution; none of the solutions being talked about in the </p><p>Cabinet (including using the military) has any hope of </p><p>addressing the problem effectively, he opined.  Finally, </p><p>Montenegro worried that the international community </p><p>(including the US) will gradually disengage from Guatemala if </p><p>they don\'t see the Portillo Administration addressing its own </p><p>problems and strengthening governability in this final year. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) The confluence of popular demands and street-level </p><p>protests is no surprise--it has surfaced in several forms </p><p>since 2000 (which the GOG has dealt with, often by postponing </p><p>resolution of conflicts) and may increase as the election </p><p>campaign heats up.  The major social groups are competing for </p><p>resources the GOG doesn\'t have to offer, and are frustrated </p><p>after long fruitless efforts at dialogue with the government </p><p>and a succession of unmet promises.  To a large extent, </p><p>Portillo brought this series of social protests on himself by </p><p>conceding early to ex-PAC demands for compensation after they </p><p>blocked tourist and transportation access in the Peten last </p><p>year. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) The Government does not appear to have a coherent </p><p>strategy for dealing with the current social protests, and </p><p>the lack of leadership, indeed, the virtual absence of </p><p>President Portillo, has led many to question if the Portillo </p><p>Administration is beginning to disengage. </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) If the Portillo Administration does not respond </p><p>effectively to the current challenges to governability, and </p><p>protests continue through the electoral campaign, public </p><p>doubts about the transparency of the electoral process will </p><p>grow.  The international community has little to offer the </p><p>GOG in terms of addressing the underlying problems which have </p><p>led to the protests, but it is in our interest to seek an </p><p>early beginning to international election monitoring in order </p><p>to ensure the transparency and public credibility of the </p><p>elections. </p><p>HAMILTON </p><p></p></div>
