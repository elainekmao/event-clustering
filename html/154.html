<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 ALEXANDRIA 00292 </p><p> </p><p>USCINCCENT FOR POLAD HOWELL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS: KPRP, PINS, PGOV, PHUM, ECON, PINR, SOCI, EG </p><p>SUBJECT:  ISLAMIC TRILOGY, PART III:  COMMERCIAL AND </p><p>          PHILANTHROPIC ACTIVITIES OF THE ISLAMIC </p><p>          RIGHT IN ALEXANDRIA </p><p> </p><p>REF:  (A)  ALEXANDRIA 00289 </p><p>      (B)  ALEXANDRIA 00290 </p><p>      (C)  ALEXANDRIA 00291 </p><p>- </p><p>1.  (CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT.) </p><p>- </p><p>- </p><p>2.  SUMMARY AND COMMENT:  THIS TELEGRAM TRANSMITS </p><p>THE THIRD AND FINAL INSTALLMENT IN OUR SERIES </p><p>ON THE ISLAMIC RIGHT IN ALEXANDRIA.  WHILE THE </p><p>SPIRITUAL FORCE OF RIGHTIST ISLAM IS GROWING, </p><p>ITS POLITICAL POTENTIAL IS STILL RELATIVELY </p><p>UNFORMED AND DIFFICULT TO GAUGE IN ALEXANDRIA, </p><p>EVEN IF IT EXISTS BEHIND THE SCENES.  WHERE THE </p><p>ISLAMIC RIGHT IS HAVING ITS INFLUENCE MORE </p><p>PALPABLY FELT IS IN COMMERCE, SOCIAL AND WELFARE </p><p>ACTIVITIES, AND PHILANTHROPY.  FOR THE TIME </p><p>BEING, THIS HAS NOT TRANSLATED INTO ANY DIRECT </p><p>POLITICAL SPOILS.  HOWEVER, BUSINESSMEN WITH </p><p>ISLAMIC CREDENTIALS (OR IN ORDER TO OBTAIN </p><p>ISLAMIC CREDENTIALS) DONATE MONEY TO THE "ISLAMIC </p><p>GAMAAT," SOME OF THE PROMINENT RELIGIOUS LEADERS </p><p>MENTIONED IN PART II, AND MANY OF THE WELFARE </p><p>AND CHARITABLE ACTIVITIES THEY SPONSOR.  IN </p><p>THIS WAY, THE ACTIVITIES OF THE ISLAMIC ECNOMIC </p><p>SECTOR ARE SOMEWHAT DISTURBING, TENDING TO PROVIDE </p><p>THE FINANCIAL WHEREWITHAL TO POTENTIALLY DESTABILIZING </p><p>SOCIO-POLITICAL GROUPS WHO SOMETIMES HAVE A VERY </p><p>DIFFERENT POLITICAL AGENDA THAN THE GOE.  IN </p><p>OTHER WAYS, HOWEVER, THESE BUSINESSMEN ACTUALLY </p><p>CONTRIBUTE TO THE STABILITY OF THE CURRENT </p><p>REGIME BY PROVIDING A PORTION OF THE SAFETY NET </p><p>AND SERVICES WHICH AN OVERSTRETCHED GOVERNMENT </p><p>CANNOT PROVIDE.  END SUMMARY AND COMMENT. </p><p>- </p><p>- </p><p>WHO\'S WHO IN ALEXANDRIA\'S ISLAMIC BUSINESS WORLD? </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>3.  AN INCREASING NUMBER OF COMPANIES IN ALEXANDRIA, </p><p>AS ELSEWHERE IN EGYPT, ARE ADDING "ISLAMIC" TO </p><p>THEIR TITLES OR--MORE COMMONLY--LETTING WORD </p><p>SPREAD THAT THEY ARE ISLAMIC COMPANIES.  IN </p><p>PRACTICE, THIS SOMETIMES MEANS USING ISLAMIC </p><p>BANKING INSTITUTIONS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AND </p><p>GIVING PREFERENCE TO MUSLIMS AS EMPLOYEES.  IN </p><p>SOME INSTANCES, BUSINESSMEN ARE AFFILIATING </p><p>THEMSELVES WITH SUCH ACTIVITIES OR COMPANIES </p><p>BECAUSE IT IS CHIC TO DO SO.  OTHERS INVOLVE </p><p>THEMSELVES FROM SINCERE CONVICTION, BECAUSE THEY </p><p>HOPE TO PROFIT FROM SUCH ALLIANCES, OR THE </p><p>MOTIVATION MAY BE A COMBINATION OF THE ABOVE. </p><p>- </p><p>- </p><p>4.  TWO PILLARS OF THE LOCAL BUSINESS ESTABLISHMENT, </p><p>MUSTAFA AL-NAGGAR, AND MOHAMMED RAGAB HAVE LONG </p><p>BEEN IDENTIFIED WITH THIS CURRENT, ALTHOUGH THEY </p><p>ARE NOT AFFILIATED DIRECTLY WITH ANY ISLAMIC </p><p>COMPANIES PER SE.  TOGETHER, THEY ARE AMONG THE </p><p>LEADING BENEFACTORS IN ALEXANDRIA TO ISLAMIC </p><p>INDIVIDUALS, ORGANIZATIONS AND SOCIETIES--SOME RADICAL, </p><p>SOME NOT.  FOR EXAMPLE, AL-NAGGAR IS PERSONALLY </p><p>CLOSE TO SHAYKH AHMAD AL-MAHALLAWI, ALTHOUGH HE </p><p>(NAGGAR) NEVER ARTICULATES SIMILARLY INTOLERANT </p><p>POLITICAL OR RELIGIOUS VIEWS AND, INDEED, INSISTS </p><p>THAT AL-MAHALLAWI HAS MELLOWED.  NEVERTHELESS, </p><p>NAGGAR IS CONSIDERED ONE OF THE TWO WEALTHIEST </p><p>MEN IN ALEXANDRIA, AND HIS SUPPORT FOR THE </p><p>ISLAMIC RIGHT HERE, REGARDLESS OF MOTIVATION, </p><p>IS SIGNIFICANT. </p><p>- </p><p>- </p><p>5.  MOHAMMAD RAGAB IS YOUNGER, MORE DYNAMIC, AND--IN </p><p>THE VIEW OF OUR MUCH PRAISED COMMERCIAL SPECIALISTS--A </p><p>BETTER BUSINESSMAN THAN NAGGAR.  HE IS NOT AS </p><p>WEALTHY, BUT HE IS MORE AMBITIOUS AND OUTSPOKEN. </p><p>A SIGN OVER THE BAR NEXT TO THE OLYMPIC-SIZED </p><p>INDOOR POOL AT HIS SUMPTUOUS HOME ADVERTISES </p><p>THAT "FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR HEALTH, THE RAGABS </p><p>SERVE ONLY FRUIT JUICES AND SOFT DRINKS." </p><p>- </p><p>- </p><p>6.  THERE IS BAD BLOOD BETWEEN RAGAB AND NAGGAR, </p><p>LARGELY BECAUSE THE FORMER MOVED INTO THE IMPORTED </p><p>FOOD AREA WHICH HAD BEEN NAGGAR\'S MAINSTAY WHEN </p><p>THE CAR IMPORT AND HEAVY MACHINERY BUSINESS, </p><p>WHICH WAS RAGAB\'S PRINCIPAL ACTIVITY, LOST </p><p>VIABILITY WITH THE NEW IMPORT RESTRICTIONS. </p><p>RAGAB CURRENTLY HEADS THE ALEXANDRIA BUSINESSMEN\'S </p><p>GROUP BUT HAS AMBITIONS TO CUT A WIDER SWATH. </p><p>AS EFFECTIVE AS HE IS, HE IS DISLIKED IN SOME </p><p>CIRCLES BECAUSE HE IS VIEWED AS TOO MUCH OF A </p><p>SELF-PROMOTER.  NOT IDENTIFIED WITH ANY ONE </p><p>ISLAMIC SPIRITUAL PERSONALITY IN ALEXANDRIA, RAGAB </p><p>IS ALLEGED TO DONATE CONSIDERABLE SUMS OF MONEY </p><p>TO A VARIETY OF ISLAMIC CHARITIES AND "ISLAMIC </p><p>GAMAAT."  IN ADDITION, HE HAS HELPED PROMOTED </p><p>BUSINESSMEN WHO ARTICULATE A SIMILAR, "ISLAMIC," </p><p>POINT OF VIEW. </p><p>- </p><p>- </p><p>7.  ANOTHER FIGURE WHO IS OF INTEREST LOCALLY IS </p><p>DR. ALI AL-MEHELBA WHO HEADS THE AL-ANDALUS ACID </p><p>COMPANY (DISCUSSED IN DETAIL IN 86 ALEXANDRIA 1406). </p><p>TRAINED AS A MEDICAL DOCTOR, AL-MEHELBA MORE OR </p><p>LESS CAME FROM NOWHERE.  HIS CONSTRUCTION </p><p>ACTIVITIES (UPSCALE HOUSING, HOSPITALS, AND </p><p>TOURIST VILLAGE SCHEMES) ARE WIDE SCALE AND ARE </p><p>ALLEGEDLY FINANCED THROUGH SHAREHOLDING AND </p><p>PYRAMID FINANCING IN A WAY TO AVOID THE APPEARANCE </p><p>OF PAYING "INTEREST."  HOWEVER, HE APPEARS TO </p><p>HAVE OVER EXTENDED HIMSELF, AND LOCAL SOURCES </p><p>TELL US HE MAY BE IN TROUBLE.  THIS HAS NOT </p><p>STOPPED HIM, HOWEVER, FROM PLANNING ADDITIONAL </p><p>PROJECTS. </p><p>- </p><p>- </p><p>8.  MEHELBA IS BELIEVED TO HAVE CLOSE TIES AND </p><p>"FRIENDS" IN SAUDI ARABIA.  HE MAINTAINS BRANCHES </p><p>OF HIS FIRM THERE, IN PART TO ELICIT FINANCIAL </p><p>SUPPORT FROM THE LARGE EXPATRIATE EGYPTIAN </p><p>COMMUNITY WHO OFTEN INVEST IN HIS CONSTRUCTION </p><p>PROJECTS.  IT IS ALSO RUMORED THAT UNIDENTIFIED </p><p>SAUDI SOURCES GAVE MEHELBA HIS INITIAL BOOST </p><p>AND MAY ALSO BE CALLED UPON TO RESCUE HIM IF HIS </p><p>CURRENT LIQUIDITY PROBLEMS ARE NOT RESOLVED. </p><p>- </p><p>- </p><p>9.  TWO OTHER INTERESTING BUSINESS FIGURES HAVE </p><p>ALLEGED TIES TO SAUDI ARABIA.  ONE, TALAAT </p><p>MUSTAFA IBRAHIM (USUALLY KNOWN AS TALAAT MUSTAFA) </p><p>RUNS THE HUGE ALEXANDRIA CONSTRUCTION COMPANY. </p><p>NO ONE REALLY KNOWS WHERE MUSTAFA GOT HIS ORIGINAL </p><p>SEED MONEY:  ALEXANDRIANS ARE SUSPICIOUS THAT </p><p>MUSLIM BROTHERS (MANY OF WHOM WERE EXILED IN </p><p>SAUDI ARABIA) HELPED HIM OBTAIN SAUDI BACKING </p><p>IN THE MID-1970\'S. </p><p>- </p><p>- </p><p>10.  IN ANY EVENT, MUSTAFA TENDS TO WEAR HIS </p><p>ISLAM ON HIS SLEEVE, WHILE HIS WIFE, WHO WEARS </p><p>THE "HEGAB" OR HEAD COVERING, HAS MADE HERSELF </p><p>UNWELCOME IN SOME QUARTERS BECAUSE OF HER INCESSANT </p><p>EXHORTATIONS TO OTHER UPPER CLASS WOMEN TO DO </p><p>LIKEWISE.  MUSTAFA\'S MOST CONTROVERSIAL MOVE TO </p><p>DATE HAS BEEN THE PLACEMENT OF A LARGE, AND </p><p>HIGHLY VISIBLE BILLBOARD, WITH THE ISLAMIC CREED </p><p>EMBLAZONED ON IT, ON TOP OF ONE OF HIS BUILDINGS </p><p>(86 ALEXANDRIA 1425).  HE HAS VERY CLOSE RELATIONS </p><p>WITH MUHAMMED RAGAB, AND THE LATTER HAS BEEN </p><p>ACCUSED BY DETRACTORS OF TRYING TO PROMOTE HIM </p><p>INTO A KEY POSITION WITHIN THE ALEXANDRIA </p><p>BUSINESSMEN\'S GROUP.  TOGETHER, THE TWO WERE </p><p>RECENTLY INVOLVED IN A CONTROVERSIAL (BUT NOT </p><p>UNPOPULAR) PROPOSAL TO BUILD AN ISLAMIC-ORIENTED </p><p>PRIVATE COLLEGE IN ALEXANDRIA.  THE MINISTER OF </p><p>EDUCATION RECENTLY QUASHED THE IDEA ON CURRICULUM </p><p>GROUNDS, BUT MOVES ARE UNDERWAY TO TRY TO RESUSCITATE IT. </p><p>- </p><p>- </p><p>11.  ANOTHER "MYSTERIOUS" BUSINESSMAN WHO IS </p><p>BECOMING PROMINENT IS HAJJ AHMED EBEID (AKA </p><p>AHMAD UBAYD).  HE IS AFFILIATED WITH TWO ISLAMIC </p><p>INVESTMENT COMPANIES.  THERE HAVE BEEN SOME </p><p>SUGGESTIONS THAT EBEID IS AFFILIATED WITH ALI </p><p>AL-MEHELBA, BUT THIS HAS NOT YET BEEN CONFIRMED. </p><p>- </p><p>- </p><p>ALEXANDRIA ACTIVITIES OF ISLAMIC COMPANIES AND BANKS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>12.  THERE ARE SEVERAL "ISLAMIC COMPANIES" BASED </p><p>IN ALEXANDRIA, INCLUDING AL-ANDALUS ACID </p><p>(MENTIONED ABOVE), AL-MADINA AL-MINAWARA (REAL </p><p>ESTATE DEVELOPMENT), AL-MARWA, AL-SAFAA, AND THE </p><p>ALEXANDRIA CONSTRUCTION COMPANY, AN OLDER </p><p>COMPANY FOUNDED IN 1974.  A FORMER GOVERNOR OF </p><p>ALEXANDRIA TOLD US ON JANUARY 29 THAT THE </p><p>ISLAMIC COMPANIES ARE HEALTHY, GROWING RAPIDLY, </p><p>AND THAT THIS TREND WILL CONTINUE. </p><p>- </p><p>- </p><p>13.  THE LARGEST SUCH FIRM (AND ONE OF THE OLDEST) </p><p>IS PROBABLY TALAAT MUSTAFA\'S ALEXANDRIA </p><p>CONSTRUCTION COMPANY.  THIS COMPANY HAS BUILT </p><p>600 FLATS IN MONTAZA AND IS CONSTRUCTING SUMMER </p><p>FLATS IN MAMOURA.  TO THE WEST OF THE CITY, IT </p><p>CONSTRUCTED ITS FIRST PROJECT AND A PLANT TO </p><p>EXTRACT SALTS IN 1974 AND BUILT 1,500 FLATS TO </p><p>ACCOMMODATE THE WORKERS. </p><p>- </p><p>- </p><p>14.  IN AN OCTOBER 1986 DISCUSSION, MUSTAFA </p><p>STATED THAT HIS COMPANY, LIKE MANY OTHERS, PUTS </p><p>ITS MONEY IN THE FAYSAL BANK AND OTHER ISLAMIC </p><p>BANKS BECAUSE THEY "TRUST" THEM AND ALSO, BECAUSE </p><p>THEY CAN TAKE DOLLARS OUT OF EGYPT "IF OR WHEN </p><p>NECESSARY."  HE FLATLY DENIED THAT FUNDS FOR </p><p>ISLAMIC COMPANIES COME FROM SAUDIS OR THE SAG, </p><p>ALLEGING THAT THE MONEY COMES SOLELY FROM EGYPTIAN </p><p>EXPATS IN SAUDI ARABIA AND THE GULF WHO WANT TO </p><p>INVEST IN EGYPT, BUY FLATS, AND WHO HAVE "MORE </p><p>TRUST" IN ISLAMIC INSTITUTIONS THAN IN SECULAR </p><p>ONES. </p><p>- </p><p>- </p><p>15.  WHILE THE FAYSAL BANK HIRES ONLY MUSLIMS, </p><p>(86 ALEXANDRIA 1215), THIS IS NOT TRUE OF SOME </p><p>OF THE COMPANIES.  A GOOD CHRISTIAN SOURCE TOLD </p><p>US RECENTLY THAT HE HAS FRIENDS WHO WORK IN ONE </p><p>OF THE AL-ANDALUS COMPANIES.  MANY ARE DESIRABLE, </p><p>HE SAID, BECAUSE OF THEIR KNOWLEDGE OF FOREIGN </p><p>LANGUAGES. </p><p>- </p><p>- </p><p>ISLAMIC WELFARE ASSOCIATIONS IN ALEXANDRIA </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>16.  EMBASSY REPORTING 986 CAIRO 28338) HAS </p><p>DETAILED THE IMPORTANT ROLE PRIVATE WELFARE </p><p>ASSOCIATIONS ROLE PLAY AS A SAFETY NET AND AS A </p><p>STABILIZING FORCE IN A CHANGING SOCIETY.  SIMILAR </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS PROSPER IN ALEXANDRIA, AND MANY OF </p><p>THEM ARE SPONSORED BY THE ISLAMIC RIGHT.  SOME </p><p>OF THESE, LIKE THE "FAJR AL-ISLAM" AND "ASR-AL-ISLAM" </p><p>CLINICS MENTIONED IN REF B ARE AFFILIATED TO </p><p>RADICAL MOSQUES (COMMENT: THE "FAJR AL-ISLAM" </p><p>CHARITABLE SOCIETY WAS THE ONLY ISLAMIC CHARITABLE </p><p>SOCIETY IN ALEXANDRIA BANNED BY THE GOE IN THE </p><p>1981 CRACKDOWN.  THE BAN WAS SUBSEQUENTLY LIFTED. </p><p>END COMMENT.) </p><p>- </p><p>- </p><p>17.  MORE COMMONLY, HOWEVER, THE ISLAMIC RIGHT </p><p>SPONSORS MODERATE CHARITY AND WELFARE ACTIVITIES </p><p>WITH FEW OR NO POLITICO-RELIGIOUS TRAPPINGS. </p><p>ALEXANDRIA PHYSICIANS ARE PARTICULARLY ACTIVE </p><p>IN ESTABLISHING POLYCLINCS.  THEY SOLICIT </p><p>PRIVATE DONATIONS FROM MOSQUES, BUY THEIR </p><p>EQUIPMENT, AND STAFF THEIR CLINICS WITHOUT </p><p>ASSISTANCE FROM THE MINISTRIES OF SOCIAL AFFAIRS </p><p>OR HEALTH.  OFTEN, PHYSICIANS FROM THE UNIVERSITY </p><p>DONATE THEIR TIME IN THE AFTERNOONS.  HOSTELS FOR </p><p>NEEDY FEMALE STUDENTS FROM OUTSIDE ALEXANDRIA, </p><p>AS WELL AS DAY CARE AND OLD-AGE CENTERS, ARE OTHER </p><p>TYPES OF ACTIVITIES SUPPORTED BY WELL-TO-DO </p><p>DEVOUT MUSLIMS.  BECAUSE THE GOE IS UNABLE TO </p><p>PROVIDE ADEQUATE FACILITIES FOR THESE VERY </p><p>NECESSARY ACTIVITIES, ISLAMIC SOCIAL WELFARE </p><p>ASSOCIATIONS OF THIS NATURE FULFILL A STABILIZING </p><p>SOCIAL FUNCTION. </p><p>- </p><p>- </p><p>PHILANTHROPY FROM THE ISLAMIC RIGHT </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>18.  MANY OF THE PROMINENT OWNERS OF ISLAMIC </p><p>COMPANIES, SUCH AS MOHAMMED RAGAB, MUSTAFA AL-NAGGAR, </p><p>AND DR. ALI MAHELBA, ARE ALSO WELL KNOWN </p><p>PHILANTHROPISTS.  FOR EXAMPLE, RAGAB AND AL-NAGGAR </p><p>HAVE CONTRIBUTED LARGE AMOUNTS OF MONEY TO A NEW </p><p>DRUG REHABILITATION HOSPITAL IN MONTAZA; </p><p>AL-NAGGAR HAS DONATED VERY EXPENSIVE EQUIPMENT </p><p>TO THE UNIVERSITY OF ALEXANDRIA HOSPITAL; AND </p><p>DR. MAHELBA TOLD US VERY RECENTLY THAT HE IS SETTING </p><p>UP A PROJECT TO SUPPLY FOOD TO THE POOR BY GETTING </p><p>WEALTHY PEOPLE TO DONATE PROVISIONS. THE PROJECT HAS </p><p>BEEN WORKED OUT ON PAPER; HE NOW SEEKING SOMEONE </p><p>TO ADMINISTER IT.  THIS LIST OF PHILANTHROPIC </p><p>ACTIVITIES IS A LONG ONE AND AN IMPORTANT </p><p>(AND IN SOME CASES, VITAL) SOURCE OF SUPPORT TO </p><p>BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE HOSPITALS, CLINICS, </p><p>ORPHANAGES, AND SPECIALIZED WELFARE INSTITUTIONS. </p><p>WITH THE POSSIBLE EXCEPTION OF USAID, "ISLAMIC" </p><p>BUSINESSMEN ARE PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT BENEFACTORS </p><p>OF PRIVATE VOLUNTARY ORGANIZATIONS (ISLAMIC OR </p><p>OTHERWISE) IN ALEXANDRIA AT THE PRESENT TIME. </p><p>- </p><p>- </p><p>19.  CONCLUDING COMMENT:  ALTHOUGH THE ECONOMIC </p><p>SQUEEZE DEPICTED IN 86 ALEXANDRIA 1301 HAS EASED </p><p>SOMEWHAT, INCREASED NUMBERS OF UNEMPLOYED AND RISING </p><p>PRICES CONTINUE TO BE A SERIOUS POTENTIAL PROBLEM </p><p>IN ALEXANDRIA, AS ELSEWHERE.  THE LOCAL GOVERNMNET </p><p>IS TRYING TO GET A HANDLE ON THE MANY INFRASTRUCTURAL </p><p>INADEQUACIES AND GENERAL UNCLEANLINESS WHICH </p><p>PLAGUE ALEXANDRIA, BUT THE PROBLEMS THE GOVERNORATE </p><p>FACES CLEARLY OUTNUMBER THE AMOUNT OF RESOURCES </p><p>IT HAS AVAILABLE TO CORRECT THEM OR AT LEAST </p><p>BRING THEM UNDER CONTROL. </p><p>- </p><p>- </p><p>20.  IN THIS SENSE, THE EXPANDING ISLAMIC </p><p>PRIVATE SECTOR COMPANIES ARE A CONSTRUCTIVE </p><p>FORCE, PROVIDING JOBS AND CONTRIBUTING GENEROUSLY </p><p>TO VITALLY NEEDED SOCIAL SERVICES THROUGH A WIDE </p><p>RANGING COMMITMENT TO WELFARE AND PHILANTHROPIC </p><p>ACTIVITIES.  THUS, WHILE IT HAS BECOME FASHIONABLE </p><p>IN SOME QUARTERS TO VIEW THE ISLAMIC RIGHT </p><p>SOLELY IN TERMS OF A THREAT TO EGYPTIAN STABILITY, </p><p>IN SOME RESPECTS, MODERATE ISLAMIC PROPONENTS </p><p>MIGHT ACTUALLY CONTRIBUTE TO EGYPT\'S STABILITY, </p><p>PROVIDED THE ECONOMY DOES NOT FURTHER DETERIORATE </p><p>AND RADICALIZE KEY SEGMENTS OF THE POPULATION. </p><p>IF THIS WERE TO HAPPEN, EXTREMIST LEADERS FROM </p><p>THE ISLAMIC RIGHT, WHO IN ALEXANDRIA HAVE ADOPTED </p><p>A LOW PROFILE, COULD VERY WELL TRY TO EXPLOIT </p><p>A TROUBLED SITUATION AND SEIZE THE INITIATIVE </p><p>FROM THE NAGGARS, THE RAGABS, AND THEIR ILK </p><p>WHO, DESPITE THEIR FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR SOME </p><p>NON-VIOLENT RADICAL ELEMENTS, SEEM DEDICATED ONLY </p><p>TO SLOW, EVOLUTIONARY CHANGE IN EGYPT.  END </p><p>CONCLUDING COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HAMBLEY </p><p></p></div>
