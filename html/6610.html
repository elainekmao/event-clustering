<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 04 COLOMBO 000476 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS, SA/PD, S/CT, NEA/NGA, </p><p>DS/DSS/ITA, INR/NESA; NSC FOR E. MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL: 03-21-13 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PTER, KPAO, ASEC, CE, MV, IZ, External Relations </p><p>SUBJECT:  TFIZ01:  GSL releases relatively constructive </p><p>statement; Situation in Sri Lanka/Maldives remains calm </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  (A) State 74254 </p><p> </p><p>-      (B) Colombo-SA/INS 03-20-03 fax </p><p>-      (C) Colombo 468, and previous </p><p>-      (D) State 72928 </p><p>-      (E) State 72921 </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador E. Ashley Wills. </p><p>Reasons: 1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C/NF) SUMMARY:  The GSL has issued a relatively </p><p>constructive statement re the Iraq situation (text in </p><p>Para 10).  In a meeting late March 20, the PM gave the </p><p>Ambassador the opportunity to help craft the message and </p><p>some improvements were made.  The PM confirmed that the </p><p>GSL would not be able to join the coalition for </p><p>political reasons.  The Sri Lanka/Maldives situation </p><p>remains calm, with some anti-U.S. rallies in the cards. </p><p>Media coverage has spiked up.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C/NF) MEETING WITH PM:  Prime Minister </p><p>Wickremesinghe invited the Ambassador to meet with him </p><p>late March 20.  Foreign Minister Fernando, Foreign </p><p>Secretary Rodrigo, and Bradman Weerakoon, the PM\'s key </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>assistant, were also present.  At the meeting, the PM </p><p>provided a draft press statement re the Iraq situation </p><p>to Ambassador Wills and asked him to review it.  The PM </p><p>indicated that he was open to any suggestions on ways to </p><p>improve the draft (on the understanding that we would </p><p>not make our involvement known).  After reviewing the </p><p>draft, which was quite long and showed some effect from </p><p>the MFA\'s NAM, G-77 type of thinking, the Ambassador </p><p>made some suggestions, which the prime minister agreed </p><p>to.  These suggestions were clearly marked in the </p><p>annotated copy of the draft, which was sent to SA/INS in </p><p>Ref A. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C/NF) After the meeting concluded, the MFA issued </p><p>the statement (which included the Ambassador\'s </p><p>suggestions) on the evening of March 20 (see text </p><p>below).  In our estimation, the statement, while not </p><p>perfect, is relatively constructive in that it cites </p><p>Iraq\'s failure to disarm.  It also expresses </p><p>"confidence" that the coalition will move to minimize </p><p>any negative impacts the war may have.  On the down </p><p>side, the statement is a bit long, allowing observers to </p><p>pick-and-choose the language they want to focus on, </p><p>including that which gives a bit too much pride-of-place </p><p>to the UN\'s standing re war and peace issues. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C/NF) As foreshadowed in Ambassador\'s March 20 </p><p>conversation with Sri Lanka\'s Ambassador to the U.S. </p><p>Devinda Subasinghe (see Ref C), the PM made clear that </p><p>it would not be possible for Sri Lanka to join the </p><p>coalition.  In explaining why, Wickremesinghe stressed </p><p>that it would be difficult politically and </p><p>constitutionally because President Kumaratunga would </p><p>have to be involved in any decision on the issue.  The </p><p>PM did not think she would be at all helpful on the </p><p>matter and it was best not to move forward with </p><p>something so controversial at this point.  (Note:  The </p><p>Ambassador is slated to meet with the president on March </p><p>25, after her return from Europe.) </p><p> </p><p>5.  (S/NF) The Ambassador also used the meeting to </p><p>review with the prime minister Ref E points arguing for </p><p>the immediate closure of the Iraqi embassy and the </p><p>expulsion of its personnel.  The Ambassador also </p><p>provided the PM Ref D points providing legal </p><p>justification for the war.  The PM took both sets of </p><p>points on board.  (Note:  Mission has conveyed Ref A </p><p>points re keeping the Iraq issue in the UNSC to the Sri </p><p>Lankan and Maldivian governments.) </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) SRI LANKA/MALDIVES SITUATION:  The general </p><p>situation in Sri Lanka and the Maldives continues to be </p><p>calm.  Since the start of military operations against </p><p>the Iraqi regime early March 20 (local time), we have </p><p>not heard of any serious disturbances in Sri Lanka. </p><p>There reportedly have been several marches by small </p><p>groups of Muslims at various places in Sri Lanka, but </p><p>nothing large and nothing violent.  As mentioned in Ref </p><p>B, however, a test for the security situation will come </p><p>after the conclusion of Muslim prayers today, Friday, </p><p>March 21, when some Muslims and leftists plan a rally in </p><p>Colombo.  Rallies at other sites around the island are </p><p>also planned. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Mission continues to pick up all the right </p><p>signals from the GSL re security issues.  The DCM </p><p>attended a meeting of the diplomatic corps on March 20, </p><p>where Interior Minister Amaratunga promised full </p><p>security support.  Amaratunga noted specifically that no </p><p>demonstrations would be allowed anywhere near the U.S. </p><p>and UK embassies, which are located next to each other </p><p>in downtown Colombo.  At embassy\'s request, security </p><p>forces remain in place, guarding Mission homes. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) MEDIA COVERAGE:  As could be expected, Sri </p><p>Lankan media coverage of the situation has spiked up and </p><p>March 21 papers are full of news articles on the start </p><p>of military operations.  Editorial opinion re the war </p><p>continues to be largely negative toward the U.S., </p><p>including this March 21 sample entitled "Will War on </p><p>Iraq free U.S. from Terrorists threat?" from the </p><p>Opposition English-language daily ISLAND: </p><p> </p><p>"...the question arises whether elimination of the </p><p>Saddam Hussein regime will rid America and European </p><p>nations from the threat of terrorism.  The war in </p><p>Afghanistan and driving out the Taliban regime have not </p><p>eliminated Al-Qaida and its leader Bin Ladin.  Even US </p><p>intelligence agencies such as the CIA and FBI have said </p><p>openly that America will not be free of terrorist </p><p>attacks.  Much progress has been made in the global war </p><p>on terrorism and President Bush has been receiving a </p><p>good response to his appeal from most countries, </p><p>including many Islamic states.  But it is evident that </p><p>he is jeopardizing his global effort on terrorism with </p><p>this war which has proven to be much unpopular." </p><p> </p><p>(Note:  Additional media coverage is contained in </p><p>Septel.)  (Note:  Coverage of the situation on the </p><p>Maldivian government website "Haveeru.com.mv" continues </p><p>to consist primarily of AFP wire-service reports.  There </p><p>are also some local postings stressing that the GoRM is </p><p>keeping apprised of the situation, and working to </p><p>ameliorate any potentially negative impacts on tourism </p><p>and other elements of the local economy.) </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) COMMENT:  Mission has received truly </p><p>extraordinary support from the GSL, which has gone out </p><p>of its way to be as helpful as possible in meeting our </p><p>security concerns.  The next several days should tell </p><p>how serious any adverse reaction to the U.S.-led action </p><p>may or may not be.  On the political side, although the </p><p>government\'s statement may not have been helpful as we </p><p>would have liked (despite our best efforts), the PM went </p><p>out of his way to try to craft it so that it was </p><p>reasonably constructive and we think he succeeded in </p><p>large part.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U) The text of the Sri Lankan MFA\'s public </p><p>statement re the Iraq situation follows: </p><p> </p><p>BEGIN TEXT: </p><p> </p><p>March 20 Press Release:  Situation in Iraq </p><p> </p><p>Sri Lanka has consistently urged Iraq to comply fully </p><p>with the United Nations Security Council resolutions </p><p>obliging it to eliminate weapons of mass destruction. </p><p> </p><p>Until now there has been a lack of full compliance with </p><p>these resolutions.  Therefore, the elimination of </p><p>weapons of mass destruction in Iraq has not been </p><p>completed through peaceful means.  Unfortunately, the </p><p>lack of concurrence in the Security Council on how to </p><p>proceed with its own Resolution 1441 adopted unanimously </p><p>has led to the collapse of the UN process. </p><p> </p><p>Sri Lanka is greatly disturbed by the outbreak of this </p><p>conflict in the Middle East.  Sri Lanka is gravely </p><p>concerned about the massive political, economic, social, </p><p>and above all, humanitarian consequences that would </p><p>ensue in the military conflict, affecting Iraq, the </p><p>Middle East region and indeed international peace and </p><p>security.  We express confidence that the coalition </p><p>partners would move early to minimize adverse </p><p>consequences on the civilian population in Iraq and, in </p><p>association with other members of the international </p><p>community, coordinate rehabilitation efforts in the </p><p>country. </p><p> </p><p>Beyond the current issue, the UN must continue to play </p><p>an undiminished role in other situations of tension such </p><p>as, in particular, the question of Palestine.  There </p><p>should be substantial progress towards an enduring and </p><p>just peace in which the States of Palestine and Israel </p><p>can develop in peace, freedom and mutual trust within </p><p>secure boundaries in accordance with the Security </p><p>Council resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and 1397 </p><p>(2002). </p><p> </p><p>The all pervasive evil of terrorism must not at this </p><p>stage be permitted to exploit and thrive on the global </p><p>uncertainty and tension which have now been heightened. </p><p>The international consensus and collective will to </p><p>eradicate all forms and manifestations of terrorism, </p><p>wherever and in whatever circumstances it occurs, must </p><p>not be deflected or blunted.  Terrorism should not be </p><p>identified and stereotyped with any particular religion, </p><p>nationality or civilization. </p><p> </p><p>Sri Lanka is conscious of the hardships and dangers that </p><p>this military conflict would pose to millions of migrant </p><p>workers in the Middle-East region, including to several </p><p>hundred thousands of our own nationals.  Our Missions in </p><p>the region are working closely with the host governments </p><p>concerned to ensure the safety and security of Sri </p><p>Lankans and their well-being in the present volatile </p><p>situation. </p><p> </p><p>Other ramifications stemming from the instability in the </p><p>Middle -East extend to Sri Lanka as well.  In this </p><p>context, therefore, the Government has taken necessary </p><p>steps to coordinate a program whereby essential food </p><p>stocks such as rice, flour, sugar, lentils and milk </p><p>products, supplies of fuel and other necessities could </p><p>be ensured without interruption and at fair prices for </p><p>consumers in the country.  To this end, the Articles and </p><p>Services (Maintenance) Bill was passed unanimously today </p><p>in the Sri Lankan Parliament. </p><p> </p><p>It is tragic in the current dangerous situation that the </p><p>UN system, in particular the Security Council, has been </p><p>rendered ineffective, and apparently, even abandoned due </p><p>to disagreement among its members.  Sri Lanka </p><p>nevertheless continues to firmly believe that issues </p><p>affecting international peace and security should be as </p><p>far as possible identified, considered and resolved </p><p>through the UN, the primary global institution through </p><p>which the will of the international community can be </p><p>legitimately expressed. </p><p> </p><p>Therefore, it is essential that the role of the UN and </p><p>its credibility and authority be restored and respected. </p><p>The Government will continue to monitor closely the </p><p>complex implications of the situation in Iraq.  Sri </p><p>Lanka will also seek to work closely with like-minded </p><p>countries in the national and collective imperative to </p><p>keep United Nations alive. </p><p> </p><p>Sri Lanka urges a quick end to this crisis based on the </p><p>sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq and the </p><p>safety, security and welfare of its people. </p><p> </p><p>END TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
