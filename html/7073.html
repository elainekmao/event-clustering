<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 002006 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>USDOC FOR 4520/ITA/MAC/ONE/COBERG </p><p>STATE PASS USTR FOR NED SAUMS </p><p>GENEVA FOR USDEL WTO </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, JO, WTRO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDAN GPA OFFER PRELIMINARY RESPONSES </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. USDOC 1003 </p><p>     B. CAMPBELL-OBERG/SAUMS/SCHEDLBAUER EMAIL OF 4/2/03 </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but Unclassified; please protect accordingly. </p><p> </p><p>1.  (sbu)  Below are informal responses to questions posed </p><p>ref a based on our conversations with Jordan\'s GPA </p><p>negotiating team and on our own research.  Answers keyed to </p><p>PARAGRAPHS in ref a. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (sbu)  Para 4:  The list of units in Annex Three </p><p>represents a fairly complete list of units subordinate units </p><p>to Annex One entities.  Excluded units are comprised </p><p>primarily of units with very low levels of annual procurement </p><p>(less than $28,000), and partially or wholly state-owned </p><p>companies, which do not procure through government tendering </p><p>in any case, according to the GOJ\'s GPA negotiating team. </p><p>Units in Annex 3 are subordinate to Annex 1 entities, though </p><p>the line is not always straight - for instance, the head of </p><p>the National Library reports directly to the Culture Minister </p><p>(straight line), but the Jordan Institute of Standards and </p><p>Metrology is run by a Board of Directors chaired by the Trade </p><p>Minister (indirect).  Both, however, contract through the </p><p>Government Tenders Directorate (GTD) and the Government </p><p>Services Directorate (GSD). </p><p> </p><p>3.  (sbu)  Para 5:  Embassy passed to action addressees ref b </p><p>a list of websites that provides a complete outline of the </p><p>GOJ structure.  We note that the newly-formed Ministry of </p><p>Environment has been excluded from the list in Annex 1, and </p><p>that several key "independent" regulatory agencies have been </p><p>excluded from Annex 3, including (but nor limited to) the </p><p>Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC), the </p><p>Electricity Board, the Atomic Energy Commission, the Central </p><p>Bank, the Institute for Diplomacy, and the Public Transport </p><p>Regulatory Commission.  Possible explanations for these </p><p>exclusions could be "National Security" exclusions per </p><p>General Note 2(b), or that these entities are considered to </p><p>fall below the $28,000 annual procurement threshold, thus </p><p>obviating the need to list them in the Annex. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (sbu)  Para 6:  No GOJ ministry has a formal definition </p><p>of SME\'s.  However, the National Fund for Enterprise Support </p><p>(NAFES), a government-controlled small business support </p><p>agency, defines SME\'s as companies with 5-100 employees (no </p><p>definitions based on revenue or capital).  Support from NAFES </p><p>for these companies is in the form of technical assistance </p><p>for capacity building, along the lines of the USAID-funded </p><p>Jordan-U.S. Business Partnership (JUSBP).  Such support could </p><p>include training employees on how to enter the procurement </p><p>market.  In addition, Chambers of Industry and Commerce in </p><p>Jordan\'s primary population centers, along with professional </p><p>associations representing key sectors like contracting and </p><p>engineers, maintain an active dialogue with the GOJ and </p><p>encourage it to distribute contracts evenly among members </p><p>(since these organizations are mandatory membership groups </p><p>under Jordanian law, they effectively "represent" all </p><p>concerned SME\'s in relevant fields). </p><p> </p><p>5.  (sbu)  Para 7:  Ref b contains a listing of key </p><p>procurement set-ups for the Water, Energy, and Transport </p><p>Ministries, as well as an illustrative (not exhaustive) list </p><p>of companies supplying the sectors.  The Ministry of </p><p>Information, Communications, and Technology (MoICT) </p><p>traditionally procures from the GTD/GSD, but was excluded </p><p>from the Entities offer in Annex 1.  With the privatization </p><p>of the Postal service, though, most of their procurement </p><p>needs fall beneath the $28,000 threshold and are hence done </p><p>internally.  Detailed information on MoICT procurement sent </p><p>to action addressees via sep e-mail. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (sbu)  Para 8:  New procurement legislation and </p><p>implementing regulations are in draft and under consideration </p><p>by the cabinet.  There are no "new" regulations in English. </p><p>Ref b, however, contains links to websites with </p><p>English-language versions of all current legislation and </p><p>regulations, as well as documentation relevant to the </p><p>USAID-funded AMIR program\'s workplan for promoting GPA </p><p>accession. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (sbu)  Para 9:  Most construction contracts for the GOJ </p><p>are tendered by the Ministry of Public Works and Housing, </p><p>though other ministries may have input on specific projects </p><p>(e.g., the Water Ministry or Jordan Valley Authority on dams </p><p>and such).  Local infrastructure construction contracts are </p><p>usually tendered by individual municipalities, provided the </p><p>project is funded by the municipality.  For instance the </p><p>Greater Amman Municipality (GAM) is tendering a </p><p>bridge-building project to connect Abdoun with fourth circle. </p><p> In addition, the Aqaba Special Economic Zone Authority </p><p>(ASEZA) has MOU\'s with most government ministries to allow it </p><p>to act on their behalf within the ASEZ.  Thus ASEZA may have </p><p>construction contracting authority within the zone. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (sbu)  Para 10:  The GOJ\'s GPA accession process is not </p><p>widely known in the business community.  A "national </p><p>committee" of interested associations including chambers of </p><p>industry and commerce, professional associations, and </p><p>Jordan\'s AmCham, was formed last year to carry out the </p><p>background analysis that formed the basis for the initial GPA </p><p>offer.  That committee, the negotiating team tells us, will </p><p>continue to advise the team throughout the negotiating </p><p>process to ensure the interests of all groups are addressed. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (sbu)  The AmCham for its part has also  actively lobbied </p><p>the GOJ for swift conclusion of the GPA accession process. </p><p>For most AmCham members (who by and large are local </p><p>representatives of U.S. companies or licensed importers of </p><p>U.S. goods and services), the GPA and the attendant </p><p>legislative reform required to accede will mean an important </p><p>step forward in liberalizing procurement within the local </p><p>market.  They see this as a critical improvement to a system </p><p>that has heretofore been marked by a lack of transparency in </p><p>the procurement process.  For a few selected companies - </p><p>notably Petra Air Conditioning - the GPA represents an </p><p>opportunity to grow the U.S. side of their business.  One </p><p>company rep estimated U.S. orders for Petra could triple once </p><p>Jordan became a GPA member and it could bid on federal, </p><p>state, and local government procurement contracts. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (sbu)  The sectors most sensitive to the potential </p><p>market adjustments resulting from GPA accession include the </p><p>Engineers\' Association and the Contractors\' Association, both </p><p>of which are dominated by relatively small companies that </p><p>survive on one or two small ($250,000 or less) government </p><p>contracts annually to stay afloat.  These companies do not </p><p>look to other countries to secure contracts.  They are not </p><p>particularly worried about competition from GPA members, </p><p>since they believe most western firms would only bid on </p><p>tenders that would be too large for them in any case. </p><p>Rather, they fear competition down the road from developing </p><p>countries like China or India which might accede in the </p><p>future, and which they fear would provide stiff competition </p><p>for even small contracts.  We and the GOJ have explained that </p><p>those small markets can be carved out of the offer, but the </p><p>sensitivities remain. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (sbu)  We will provide additional to ref a questions as </p><p>they become available. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
