<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 000763 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR P, NEA/NGA, EUR/SE, PRM/ANE AND PM (PM ACTION </p><p>TEAM); OSD FOR ISA AND ISP; JCS FOR J5 AND J3, EUCOM FOR </p><p>J3, J4, J5 AND POLAD; CENTCOM FOR J3, J4, J5 AND POLAD; NSC </p><p>FOR BRYZA; STATE PLEASE PASS TO USAID FOR OFDA - </p><p>WGARVELINK; AMMAN/KUWAIT -- PLEASE PASS TO HUMANITARIAN </p><p>PLANNING TEAM </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/04/2012 </p><p>TAGS: MARR, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: IRAQ: TURKEY REQUESTS ADDITIONAL DETAILS ON </p><p>HUMANITARIAN DAILY RATIONS BEFORE RESPONDING TO USG REQUEST </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 27018 (NODIS) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) This is an action request.  See para 5. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) On December 12, the Office of Defense Cooperation </p><p>(ODC) Turkey submitted a note to the Turkish General Staff </p><p>(TGS) requesting authorization to ship humanitarian daily </p><p>rations (HDRs) from the US to Turkey.  The ODC letter noted </p><p>that the purpose is to have rations stored in Turkey in the </p><p>event of contingency operations.  The letter proposed that </p><p>the rations be shipped commercially and be received by a </p><p>Turkish prime vendor, who would store the rations in a </p><p>commercially-leased warehouse in Adana, Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) After numerous requests for a response (both during </p><p>the EUCOM-led mil-to-mil talks and during our on-going </p><p>bilateral discussions with TGS), ODC received a written </p><p>response from TGS J5 Lt. Gen. Turgut on January 23 (see para </p><p>3 for complete text) requesting that the US provided </p><p>additional information (i.e. quantity, type, distribution </p><p>plan) for the HDRs.  TGS also requested that the additional </p><p>information be provided to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to </p><p>be included in the plan being prepared in coordination with </p><p>the UNHCR. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Following is the complete text of TGS\'s letter: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Reference letter requested import of food items prepared by </p><p>the US and kept in the US to be sent to Turkey and be stored </p><p>in a leased storage in Adana to be used during possible </p><p>operation.  Turkish General Staff has not been provided with </p><p>sufficient information on quantity, type, and distribution </p><p>plan of goods planned to be brought in Turkey for </p><p>humanitarian aid and stored in a storage facility in Adana. </p><p>Information on leased storage also has not been provided. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In regard to this issue the following is deemed appropriate: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Humanitarian aid goods to be stored in Turkey for use </p><p>during potential Iraq operation should be procured primarily </p><p>from Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--For already procured goods, if the goods are needed to </p><p>support a potential mass population movement, the goods need </p><p>to be included in the United Nations High Commissioner for </p><p>Refugees (UNHCR) plan prepared in coordination with Turkey, </p><p>and the goods need to be stored in the areas defined for this </p><p>purpose. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Request the Office of Defense Cooperation Turkey forward the </p><p>subject request with all details to the Ministry of Foreign </p><p>Affairs in order to be included in the plan prepared in </p><p>coordination with the UNHCR. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>end text. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) On January 24, ODC Turkey conveyed TGS\'s response to </p><p>EUCOM and requested that EUCOM provide ODC-Turkey/Embassy </p><p>Ankara the requested information to enable the Embassy to </p><p>submit a diplomatic note to the MFA.  We understand that </p><p>EUCOM has since forwarded our request to CENTCOM.  Neither </p><p>ODC-Ankara nor the Embassy has received the requested </p><p>information and therefore are unable to move forward on the </p><p>issue. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Action Request:  Given the importance the USG attaches </p><p>to prepositioning the HDRs in Turkey (reftel), we recommend </p><p>that the Department, in coordination with CENTCOM and other </p><p>appropriate agencies, provide the Embassy as soon as possible </p><p>the information requested in para 3.  We also request that </p><p>the Department identify for us the USG agency/organization </p><p>that has the lead on the HDR issue so we can advise the MFA. </p><p>It is clear that TGS (we believe with at least the consent of </p><p>the MFA) has decided to take this issue out of the mil-to-mil </p><p>discussions and transfer it to the civilian authorities for </p><p>resolution, and the visiting USG Humanitarian Planning Team </p><p>raised the issue in general terms with the MFA January 28. </p><p>While we recognize that it took more than one month for the </p><p>Turks to respond to our initial request, the Turks have put </p><p>the HDR ball back in the USG court for the time being and </p><p>will not take action on the issue until they receive the </p><p>information requested in para 3.  The sooner we provide the </p><p>MFA the necessary information, the sooner we can shift the </p><p>pressure back on the Turks (where it belongs) and press for a </p><p>positive answer to this important request. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
