Kizildeli noted that </p><p>Turkey had voted with the consensus when the PermReps decided </p><p>to demarche Minsk on Lukashenko\'s non-attendance at the </p><p>summit.  Turkey would act in accordance with that decision. </p><p>However, because the Turks have bilateral relations with </p><p>Minsk and prefer to keep the dialogue with Belarus open and </p><p>not push the country any farther away from NATO, Turkey will </p><p>discourage Lukashenko\'s attendance through oral, vice </p><p>written, messages.  Kizildeli said it would "not be such a </p><p>bad idea" for Lukashenko to hear the truth about the manner </p><p>in which he is running Belarus at the EAPC, because he would </p><p>not hear the truth from his own people.  But she reiterated </p><p>Turkey would honor its commitment to discourage him from </p><p>attending. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
