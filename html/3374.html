<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 001714 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>USAID FOR AFR/SA MCOPSON; DCHA/FFP LLANDIS, DSKORIC </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JFRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR CNEARY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/25/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, EAID, ASEC, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: ZIMBABWE: FOOD DISTRIBUTION RESTARTS IN ONE </p><p>OPPOSITION AREA BUT THREATS OF INTERFERENCE ARISE IN </p><p>ANOTHER </p><p> </p><p>REF: HARARE 1398 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Officer Todd Faulk for reasons 1.5 (b) </p><p>and (d) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Post has learned from Amcit Father Tom McQuillen that </p><p>the Catholic Church has been permitted to restart food </p><p>distribution in the beleaguered Binga district of </p><p>Matabeleland North province in Zimbabwe.  War veterans, </p><p>acting on the order of Local Government Minister Ignatius </p><p>Chombo, forced the Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace </p><p>(CCJP) to cease food distribution efforts throughout Binga in </p><p>late May, and hindered attempts to deliver much-needed food </p><p>to hospitals and school children (reftel).  Chombo had </p><p>accused the CCJP of improperly assuming government functions </p><p>and ordered its operation closed, despite the fact that the </p><p>CCJP had become one of the largest sources of food for rural </p><p>Binga residents.  A major element of ZANU-PF concern was </p><p>clearly that the CCJP leader in Binga is an MDC candidate in </p><p>local council elections.  Father McQuillen informed us that </p><p>after an agreement was reached with local government, the All </p><p>Souls Catholic Church in Binga and Catholic charities of the </p><p>Zimbabwean Catholic Church was permitted to take over CCJP\'s </p><p>program, and it started distributing food again on July 22 </p><p>with the help of Catholics for Overseas Development (CAFOD), </p><p>a British NGO.  CAFOD made arrangements with local trucking </p><p>companies for All Souls to deliver 85 tons of mostly maize </p><p>meal during the week of July 22; it was able to deliver 23 </p><p>tons to schools and hospitals on the first day alone.  Father </p><p>McQuillen reported that the hunger situation in Binga </p><p>district has become acute; many teachers are reporting empty </p><p>classrooms because children have been too weak to go to </p><p>school.  (Comment: That should start to change with the new </p><p>deliveries.  End comment.)  As part of the distribution </p><p>agreement, All Souls sent letters to all Church centers in </p><p>the district informing them of the distribution and asking </p><p>them to report any attempt to politicize the food deliveries </p><p>or segregate recipients based on political affiliation. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) It was only after the Binga incidents generated much </p><p>bad publicity and public pressure from the USG and Vatican </p><p>that the Government worked to find a solution.  According to </p><p>the Apostolic Nuncio, it had been difficult for the </p><p>Government to move against the war vets but that President </p><p>Mugabe himself had eventually sought positive resolution of </p><p>the problem (some six weeks after it originated). </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) While relief was restarting in Binga, government </p><p>officials threatened to stop food deliveries to opposition </p><p>supporters in another opposition stronghold, Gwanda district </p><p>in Matabeleland South province.  According to the independent </p><p>"Standard" newspaper, Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister </p><p>Abedinico Ncube threatened to stop food deliveries at a July </p><p>20 public meeting if residents did not vote for ZANU-PF in </p><p>September rural council elections.  "Maize is in abundance </p><p>but very soon it will be available only to those who dump the </p><p>opposition and work with ZANU-PF."  While handing out food, </p><p>Ncube also reportedly told the recipients that "as long as </p><p>you value the government of the day you will not starve ... </p><p>(but) you cannot vote for the MDC and expect ZANU-PF to help </p><p>you."  In another case of food politicization, the MDC </p><p>released a press statement about a July 12 meeting in which </p><p>the ZANU-PF M.P. for Beitbridge, Kembo Mohadi, warned World </p><p>Vision and Organization Help that their food relief work was </p><p>at "government\'s invitation" and that they must follow the </p><p>Government\'s directives.  Mohadi reportedly asked the NGOs </p><p>for a list of the equipment it was using to distribute food </p><p>and said "Government" would soon be taking over the food </p><p>distribution.  He also reportedly stated that he was part of </p><p>a "Cabinet Committee on Social Services Action" and that </p><p>similar meetings were taking place across the country.  The </p><p>MDC statement noted that Mohadi held the meeting in Gwanda </p><p>town, which is represented in Parliament by MDC M.P. Paul </p><p>Temba-Nyathi, and that no MDC officials were invited to the </p><p>meeting.  However, local war veterans and representatives </p><p>from the government-controlled Grain Marketing Board were </p><p>present. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) World Vision Zimbabwe Director Rudo Kwaramba told us </p><p>and the press separately that politicians could talk, but </p><p>that no food distributed by World Vision had been nor would </p><p>be politicized. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) The incidents described above demonstrate the </p><p>pressing need for an independent monitoring mechanism.  We </p><p>are working with DFID here to develop a proposal that the EU </p><p>can join us in supporting.  Our objective is to provide </p><p>funding to the UN or one of its agencies, which in turn will </p><p>contact an outside organization to conduct the monitoring. </p><p>The UN\'s involvement is necessary, as they are the only ones </p><p>capable of eliciting GOZ agreement to permit monitoring.  We </p><p>would also specify that the outside contractor gather </p><p>information from all available Zimbabwean sources as to the </p><p>fairness and impartiality of food distribution. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
