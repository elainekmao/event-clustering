<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 005692 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>USTR FOR NED SAUMS </p><p>CAIRO ALSO FOR FAS ASIF CHAUDRY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/29/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, ECON, EINV, EAGR, PINR, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: MINOR CABINET RESHUFFLE UNLIKELY TO RESULT IN ANY </p><p>POLICY CHANGES </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMBASSADOR EDWARD W. GNEHM FOR REASONS 1.5 (b) AND (d) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) The Palace announced a minor Cabinet reshuffle on </p><p>September 26 involving five portfolios.  Amman had been rife </p><p>with rumors of a reshuffle since the King\'s August 15 </p><p>announcement that elections were postponed until the Spring. </p><p>In recent conversations with the Ambassador, several young, </p><p>progressive Cabinet members--including Bassam Awadullah, </p><p>Fawwaz Zo\'bi, and Saleh Bashir--spoke heatedly about what </p><p>they perceived as the real reason for the reshuffle--an </p><p>attempt by the PM to undermine them and their reform efforts. </p><p> While some outgoing ministers may be on the outs with the </p><p>Prime Minister, several will likely be re-appointed to other </p><p>positions within the government.  The Cabinet reshuffle </p><p>portends no major policy change.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>CABINET RESHUFFLE: MOSTLY ECONOMIC PORTFOLIOS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) King Abdullah and Prime Minister Ragheb instituted a </p><p>minor Cabinet reshuffle on September 26.  The following are </p><p>the new ministers: </p><p> </p><p>Minister of National Economy: Samer Tawil (former Secretary </p><p>General of the Ministry of Trade and Industry), replacing Dr. </p><p>Muhammad Halaiqa. </p><p> </p><p>Minister of Social Development: Dr. Ruwaida Ma\'ita (former </p><p>President of the al-Hashimiyeh University), replacing Dr. </p><p>Tammam al-Ghoul. </p><p> </p><p>Minister of Health: Dr. Walid al-Ma\'ani (former Minister of </p><p>Higher Education), replacing Dr. Faleh al-Nasser. </p><p> </p><p>Minister of Higher Education: Mohammad Hamdan (former </p><p>Secretary General of the Higher Council for Science and </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Technology), replacing Dr. Waleed al-Maani (who moved to the </p><p>health ministry). </p><p> </p><p>Minister of Agriculture: Trad al-Fayez (former Senate </p><p>member), replacing Dr. Muhammad Duwairi. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The Cabinet reshuffle had been rumored since the </p><p>King\'s August 15 announcement that elections would be </p><p>postponed until Spring.  The most important portfolio that </p><p>changed hands was likely the Ministry of National Economy, </p><p>whose main responsibility has been to deal with investment </p><p>issues.  The Prime Minister replaced old hand Mohammad </p><p>Halaiqa, who had shepherded Jordan\'s accession to the WTO and </p><p>FTA negotiations with the United States.  His influence and </p><p>effectiveness had declined over the past year, probably </p><p>because of personality conflicts with Abul Ragheb.  His </p><p>replacement, Samer Tawil, is personally close to the Prime </p><p>Minister, but he does not enjoy particularly close </p><p>relationships with other members of the economic team -- </p><p>including trade minister Saleh Bashir, for whom he worked as </p><p>deputy in the Ministry of Industry and Trade -- or with the </p><p>King.  Tawil, an accountant and businessman, is well know to </p><p>the embassy as a competent problem-solver.  He has the same </p><p>pro-reform inclinations as Halaiqa, but he does not have </p><p>Halaiqa\'s stature in the community.  It remains to be seen if </p><p>Tawil will be more effective than his predecessor Halaiqa in </p><p>addressing investment climate concerns. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) In a private conversation with the Ambassador before </p><p>the reshuffle was announced, Minister of Planning Bassam </p><p>Awadullah mentioned increasing friction between Halaiqa and </p><p>the PM.  According to Awadullah, the PM had purposefully </p><p>marginalized Halaiqa and Halaiqa had become passive in </p><p>meetings of the Council of Ministers.   Awadullah told the </p><p>Ambassador that the King favors Halaiqa and will probably </p><p>re-appoint him to another government position.  Awadullah </p><p>also predicted a similar reassignment for Tammam al-Ghoul, </p><p>the former Minister of Social Development, who despite her </p><p>ousting during the recent shuffle was still considered </p><p>"solid" by both the Cabinet and the King.  Her replacement at </p><p>the Ministry of Social Development, Ruwaida Ma\'ita, is </p><p>well-connected, but also well respected in the academic </p><p>community as a serious professional. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>RESHUFFLE REFLECTS INTERNAL POLITICS IN CABINET </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) While the Cabinet reshuffle may not lead to any major </p><p>policy changes, it has underscored the division in the </p><p>Cabinet between the ambitious, young reformers (who tend to </p><p>be close to King Abdullah), and those members who favor a </p><p>more cautious, gradual approach to reform.  PM Abul Ragheb </p><p>leads the latter, while Halaiqa was seen as a leader of the </p><p>former.  In discussions over the past two weeks, several </p><p>Cabinet members complained to the Ambassador that the PM\'s </p><p>real motive for the Cabinet reshuffle was to undermine the </p><p>influence of the young reformers.  Good sources report that </p><p>initially the PM tried to drop Awadullah from the government </p><p>but was told firmly by the Palace that that would not happen. </p><p> The PM then focused on Saleh Bashir.  Bassam Awadullah told </p><p>the Ambassador that he lobbied the King directly for Bashir </p><p>to remain and the King agreed (reversing his earlier </p><p>decision).  Bashir told the Ambassador that the PM had </p><p>offered him Halaiqa\'s position as the Minister of National </p><p>Economy.  Bashir refused, saying he preferred to stay where </p><p>he was or return to the private sector rather than go to a </p><p>position, where he had seen Halaiqa marginalized.  Tawil, who </p><p>now had no job, was given Halaiqa\'s position. </p><p>6. (C) While the King checked the PM\'s ability to cleanse the </p><p>Cabinet of progressives, the PM has replaced Halaiqa with </p><p>fiscally-conservative Minister of Finance Michel Marto as the </p><p>Cabinet\'s chair of the Economic and National Development </p><p>Committee.  This is a blow to progressive Cabinet members, </p><p>whose initiatives and reform agendas clash with the mandate </p><p>of the fiscally-conservative Marto.  For example, Zo\'bi on </p><p>several occasions has charged that Marto and the PM are </p><p>opposing his efforts to liberalize the IT sector.  According </p><p>to Zo\'bi, the PM had recently warned him not to directly </p><p>lobby the King in favor of broad band.  However, following </p><p>the King\'s strong endorsement of the IT sector--seen this </p><p>week by his high-profile involvement with the Information and </p><p>Communications Technology Forum--the PM called Zo\'bi to </p><p>congratulate him on his efforts at the conference and to </p><p>express his desire to discuss the broad band issue.  Perhaps, </p><p>said Zobi, the PM\'s political instincts will help turn the </p><p>PM\'s conservative attitude on the IT sector. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Despite the larger internal politics at play with the </p><p>reshuffle, we believe that one of the PM\'s motives for the </p><p>reshuffle was to get rid of several ineffectual ministers </p><p>(some would even put Bashir, who has yet to be identified </p><p>with a major policy initiative, into this category).  We are </p><p>also hopeful that the changes at the Health and Agriculture </p><p>Ministries will put more effective individuals in charge of </p><p>these politically sensitive portfolios.  Dr. Waleed Maani has </p><p>some prior business experience in the health field.  This is </p><p>in contrast to his predecessor, who tended to take populist </p><p>positions on IPR and drug pricing issues.  Dr. Faleh </p><p>al-Nasser had also been blocked by the massive health </p><p>ministry bureaucracy in making badly needed reforms in the </p><p>sclerotic ministry. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Trad Fayez, an ex-diplomat, replaces an agricultural </p><p>scientist at the agriculture ministry.  Despite an apparent </p><p>personal lack of agriculture experience, Fayez\'s family is </p><p>very involved in Jordan Valley farming.  We understand his </p><p>replacement of the ineffectual Dr. Duwairi signals a </p><p>commitment by the King and government to implement tough new </p><p>agriculture reforms under a new national agriculture strategy </p><p>that will be announced later this month (septel). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  The tension between the younger and more progressive </p><p>ministers, those eager for change, and the more conservative </p><p>PM and other ministers has been on the rise.  The PM saw the </p><p>reshuffle as a chance to reduce the influence of the younger </p><p>progressives but he was ultimately checked by the King, whose </p><p>affinity lies with this younger group.  That being said, for </p><p>the moment, the PM and the conservatives seem to have the </p><p>upper hand.  The King and the government are focused on </p><p>regional difficulties they expect to face in the months ahead </p><p>-- both in Iraq and Palestine.  Their eye is on elections in </p><p>the Spring.  We may, therefore, see a hiatus in the economic </p><p>reform process to which the King, and we believe even the </p><p>Prime Minister, are committed.  While there may be few, if </p><p>any, major new reform initiatives over the coming months, we </p><p>do not expect backtracking on reforms already made or in the </p><p>works. </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) Bios on the new ministers will follow in septel. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
