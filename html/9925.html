<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 004949 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EUR A/S JONES </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/06/2013 </p><p>TAGS: MASS, MOPS, MARR, PREL, TU, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: SAWYERS AND DE MELLO VISIT ANKARA TO CONSULT ON </p><p>IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by CDA Robert Deutsch, reasons 1.5, b/d. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Baghdad minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Summary: Outgoing British Iraq Special Envoy Sawyers </p><p>and UN Iraq envoy de Mello visited Ankara July 30-31 and </p><p>August 4 respectively.  Both visitors exchanged assessments </p><p>of Iraq with the GOT and noted the usefulness of a Turkish </p><p>contribution to the stability force without applying pressure </p><p>in that regard.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Departing British Iraq Special Envoy Sawyers visited </p><p>Ankara July 30-31.  According to UK DCM David Fitton, Sawyers </p><p>met with FM Gul, MFA U/S Ziyal, DefMin Gonul, Opposition </p><p>leader Baykal and several AK MPs. Fitton noted the visit was </p><p>primarily a useful exchange of views on Iraq.  Turkish </p><p>officials expressed their concerns about approving the </p><p>deployment of Turkish troops to participate in the Iraq </p><p>stabilization force.  Gul was the most optimistic about a </p><p>potential contribution, while Gonul and Ziyal focused more on </p><p>the difficulties.  The AK parliamentarians noted the uphill </p><p>struggle they faced to approve such a deployment with public </p><p>opinion currently very downbeat on a contribution and the US </p><p>in general.  Sawyers noted Turkish participation would be </p><p>useful and congratulated the GOT on its recently passed </p><p>rehabilitation law aimed at reintegrating PKK/KADEK members </p><p>back into Turkish society.  Fitton said the Turks were "quite </p><p>hopeful" the law would be effective, although, not </p><p>surprisingly, Baykal was skeptical. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) MFA Iraq Head of Department Kerim Uras said the </p><p>Turkish interlocutors noted to Sawyers the GOT\'s concerns </p><p>about the situation in Iraq saying, "you know the issues" </p><p>(i.e. Mahmoud Othman, PKK, the Turkmen, lack of contact with </p><p>the CPA, etc.).  Uras said Sawyers was very blunt and not </p><p>very open to hearing the Turkish views.  In addition, Turkish </p><p>officials believed Sawyers painted an overly rosy picture of </p><p>the situation in Iraq and "his arrogance left a very bad </p><p>taste in our mouths." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Uras said de Mello was in Ankara for a short period of </p><p>time, coming from and returning to Baghdad on the same day. </p><p>He met only with FM Gul and had a working lunch and dinner </p><p>with Turkish officials.  Uras said de Mello came with no </p><p>particular message, but like Sawyers, was merely here to </p><p>exchange views on and assessments of Iraq.  De Mello </p><p>expressed frustration at the low level of cooperation with </p><p>the UN on Iraq, noting that better cooperation would be good </p><p>for the security situation.  De Mello also noted a Turkish </p><p>contribution to the stability force would be useful, but </p><p>acknowledged there were risks involved for Turkish soldiers. </p><p>He doubted another UN resolution would be possible under the </p><p>current circumstances.  De Mello was pleased with the </p><p>humanitarian aid coming from Turkey and congratulated the GOT </p><p>on the August 1 passage of a law that allows a "more </p><p>official" WFP office to open in Turkey that will serve as a </p><p>hub for food aid to Iraq.  De Mello also told the Turks that </p><p>US forces had discovered and confiscated a large amount of </p><p>weapons at UNHCR\'s Mahmur Refugee camp, near the Turkish </p><p>border.  He suggested a joint plan by the US, TU, UNHCR and </p><p>his office to implement the rehabilitation law and repatriate </p><p>the PKK/KADEK members, most of whom were non-militant Kurds. </p><p>DEUTSCH </p><p></p></div>
