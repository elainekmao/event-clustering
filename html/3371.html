<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 002202 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/24/2007 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, KDEM, PINS, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: THREE NEW POLITICAL PARTIES--OLD WINE IN </p><p>NEW BOTTLES </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER.  REASONS 1.5 (B) </p><p>AND (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: INEC registered three new political parties </p><p>June 22, bringing the total of approved parties to six. </p><p>However, this doubling of the number of parties does not </p><p>represent liberalization of the political landscape. At least </p><p>two of the three parties, the NDP and the UNPP, are tied to </p><p>former Head of State Babangida.  The AGPA is more of a </p><p>mystery. There is some indication of Babangida\'s involvement, </p><p>as some believe the party is the former general\'s bridge to </p><p>the Southeast. Still others think President Obasanjo\'s </p><p>strategists registered the party to divide the Southeast in </p><p>order to douse the prospect of a North-Southeast alliance </p><p>against Obasanjo\'s presidential candidacy.  In any event, the </p><p>new parties are laden with former military officers as well </p><p>as civilians who had attained comfortable niches under </p><p>various military regimes.  INEC did not register any of the </p><p>less establishment-oriented parties that could have injected </p><p>fresh blood into the electoral contests.  In the end, the </p><p>decision to register only these parties will assure that </p><p>closed shop, politics-as-usual will be the dominant force </p><p>during the upcoming election season.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) </p><p>completed the party registration exercise on June 22, by </p><p>certifying three new parties: the All Progressives Grand </p><p>Alliance (APGA), the National Democratic Party (NDP) and the </p><p>United Nigeria Peoples Party (UNPP). Among the 24 parties </p><p>that failed to make the cut were the NCP, led by veteran </p><p>pro-democracy advocate Gani Fawehinmi and the PRP headed by </p><p>progressive Northern political veteran, former Kaduna State </p><p>Governor Balarabe Musa. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The registration of the NDP and UNPP is not surprising </p><p>but the AGPA validation was unexpected. Both the UNPP and the </p><p>NDP have been linked to Ibrahim Babangida (IBB) and power </p><p>structures of both groups are peopled with his acolytes. The </p><p>UNPP has several retired senior military officers and former </p><p>military Vice-President under Babangida, Augustus Aikhomu, is </p><p>the Chairman of the UNPP\'s Board of Trustees. Both the UNPP </p><p>and NDP have significant numbers of South/South political </p><p>personalities and some Southeasterners. The NDP seems to have </p><p>more Northerners in the formal party hierarchy than the UNDP. </p><p> The AGPA appears to be heavily Igbo influenced but none of </p><p>the Igbo major leaguers are formally involved.  It is not </p><p>immediately clear who are the heavy hitters, if any, behind </p><p>the APGA. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Discussions with UNPP and NDP members reveal strong </p><p>attachment to IBB.  Former Senator Dangana Ndayako, a </p><p>founding member of the PDP and now a charter member of the </p><p>NDP, told Polcouns that he and most party organizers </p><p>supported an IBB candidacy.  Two veteran reporters of the </p><p>Nigerian political scene told the Ambassador that the </p><p>euphoria in front of INEC headquarters when the approval of </p><p>the three parties was publicly announced resembled a </p><p>Babangida pep-rally.  Appearing in equal numbers with party </p><p>banners were those calling for IBB to run in 2003.  UNPP and </p><p>NDP party members spent as much time vocalizing their support </p><p>for Babangida as celebrating their parties\' successful </p><p>registration. APGA members were much more restrained. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>The UNPP - A Party and One-Half </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Ironically, by the time it was formally registered, </p><p>the UNPP should have ceased to exist; it had previously </p><p>merged with the APP to form the ANPP.  However, that merger </p><p>was de facto not de jure.  With its successful registration, </p><p>the UNPP is not only united with the APP in practice; it also </p><p>retains its own distinct corporate existence as well.  Unless </p><p>INEC abrogates the merger on the basis that the UNPP had no </p><p>legal existence at the time of the merger, the UNPP will </p><p>enjoy the political equivalent of having its cake and eating </p><p>it too. While unique, this duality is also causing tension </p><p>within the UNPP. Some UNPP members, who did not benefit from </p><p>the merger, are claiming that the merger was a nullity and </p><p>that, by their very actions, those UNPP members who favored </p><p>the union have exited the party. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> 6.  (C) Babangida allies who participated in the UNPP-APP </p><p>merger into the ANPP are working to block former Head of </p><p>State Buhari from capturing the ANPP nomination. Thus, in </p><p>addition to influencing ANPP positions, the UNPP can still do </p><p>its own thing as an independent party.  One member of the APP </p><p>before the merger told Polcouns in early July that </p><p>Babangida\'s influence in the party has risen due to the UNPP </p><p>influx and that Babangida will be one of the major factors </p><p>determining who gets the party\'s nomination. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p>The AGPA- A Babangida Ploy, an Obasanjo Ruse, or Both? </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) Taken at face value, the AGPA represents Igbo </p><p>agitation for an Igbo President in 2003.  In the end it </p><p>probably will not be a major factor unless allied with </p><p>another party.  A Southeastern-based party with a one-issue </p><p>platform (the ethnic identity of the President) does not have </p><p>sufficient gravitational pull to stand alone.  The situation </p><p>changes if the party is allied with a Northern-oriented </p><p>group, recreating the old North-Southeast axis. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Here is where intrigue knocks at the door.  Professor </p><p>Ukandi Damachi, an intelligent, information peddler and </p><p>consummate Babangida strap-hanger, recounted to Ambassador </p><p>Jeter a July 5 meeting Damachi had with Babangida.  Damachi </p><p>jokingly told the former Head of State that with the </p><p>registration of the UNPP and the NDP, Babangida had fathered </p><p>twins.  The former Head of State corrected Damachi, saying </p><p>with a grin that he had "triplets," adding the APGA to the </p><p>parties under his wing. However, an opposite spin on the </p><p>APGA\'s pedigree was offered by Gani Fawehinmi.  Fawehinmi, a </p><p>staunch Obasanjo critic who has repeatedly called for the </p><p>President\'s resignation, believes the APGA is Obasanjo\'s </p><p>artifice to divide the Southeast and the Igbo vote.  He </p><p>claimed Obasanjo will try to bully and buy off APGA party </p><p>officials so that the group will nominate him, thus </p><p>undermining the solidarity of the call for an Igbo president. </p><p>(Comment: Due to the convoluted nature of politics here, </p><p>plausibly both Damachi and Fawehinmi are partially right. In </p><p>that so much of what happens in determining the control of </p><p>the party depends on who is the highest bidder, both the </p><p>Obasanjo camp and Babangida may be trying to woo the AGPA for </p><p>divergent reasons: IBB wants to build the North-Southeast </p><p>Axis while Obasanjo seeks to prevent it. End Comment.). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) During a July 17 call on the Ambassador, </p><p>representatives from the APGA (5 members of the National </p><p>Executive Committee, including one-time presidential </p><p>candidate Sarah Djibril) claimed that AGPA was the only party </p><p>with no ties to the military elite.  The APGA leadership </p><p>disavowed that it was an Igbo dominated body, but with half </p><p>of its leadership from the Southeast, that argument was not </p><p>convincing.  We do note that the second-in-command hails from </p><p>Niger State, Babangida\'s home.  This may be happenstance, but </p><p>it gives rise to suspicions that IBB has access to APGA. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>The Losing Side of Party Registration </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) Ostensibly to advance the constitutional requirement </p><p>that new parties reflect "federal character" (ethnic and </p><p>regional diversity), INEC developed criteria to validate </p><p>party registrations.  The requirements included having </p><p>offices in 24 states, filing affidavits that no members </p><p>belong to any other party, establishing a transparent process </p><p>for the election of national representatives and holding </p><p>party membership open to all Nigerians. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) The goal of achieving "federal character" collided </p><p>with the goal of opening the political space so that people </p><p>with alternative ideas might compete in the electoral </p><p>process. One disgruntled human rights activist caviled that </p><p>someone who had creative ideas for improving his local </p><p>community in Lagos was faced with a Hobson\'s choice.  Either </p><p>that person would have to form a party and accumulate </p><p>sufficient funds to "establish an office in Bauchi" and other </p><p>far-flung places or, alternatively, join an existing </p><p>political party.  While the latter option would save money, </p><p>the person would still have to bribe existing party officials </p><p>to win the party\'s nomination.  By committing that initial </p><p>transgression, the person would be steadily infected by the </p><p>politics of corruption.  An isolated individual is no match </p><p>and will be engulfed by Nigeria\'s system of moneyed politics, </p><p>the activist lamented. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) Human rights activists not only bemoan the fact that </p><p>the registration did not create more opportunities for </p><p>political participation, many believe the registration </p><p>process was retrogressive.  These Nigerians point to the fact </p><p>that IBB is bankrolling the UNPP, the NDP and perhaps the </p><p>AGPA while also having placed a firm down payment to buy </p><p>influence in the ANPP. Meanwhile Obasanjo\'s team is trying to </p><p>strengthen control of the PDP and perhaps the APGA. </p><p>Additionally, while attempting to fortify their positions </p><p>within the various parties they influence, both likely will </p><p>spend money to weaken each other and cause dissent in the </p><p>heart of the others\' camp. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p>13. (C) Many cynical Nigerians believe that INEC is not a </p><p>free agent and the approval of the three parties was </p><p>engineered by Obasanjo to fragment the strongest pockets of </p><p>his opposition. For example, by registering the NDP he drives </p><p>a wedge in the North and upper Middle Belt between the older </p><p>Northern politicians in the ANPP and the younger ones in the </p><p>NDP. Although the APP and UNPP have announced their merger </p><p>creating the ANPP, a formal union has not yet taken place. </p><p>Obasanjo\'s team will work hard to scuttle the union, in order </p><p>to keep his opposition as divided as possible. As earlier </p><p>stated, registering the AGPA may also be Obasanjo\'s way of </p><p>keeping the Igbo\'s from gathering under one tent. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) Under a more charitable analysis, INEC did a credible </p><p>job registering the parties that satisfy the guidelines.  As </p><p>one INEC official put it, "We know which parties are </p><p>serious." However, pro-democracy activists counter that the </p><p>electorate, not INEC should determine whether a party is </p><p>"serious" or not. This criticism carries some merit.  While </p><p>INEC may have been pursuing the laudable goal of "federal </p><p>character", its decision may have paid inadequate attention </p><p>to political openness.  For example, none of the </p><p>"progressive" parties based in the Southwest or North were </p><p>approved.  While these parties have no chance of taking the </p><p>election, their campaigns would have likely been more </p><p>issue-based than the campaigns of the larger parties. As </p><p>such, they might have put modest "peer pressure" on the major </p><p>parties not to reside totally in the arena of power politics, </p><p>but give some, albeit limited, attention to key economic and </p><p>social issues facing the average Nigerian. However, these </p><p>parties also would have chipped into some of the votes </p><p>Obasanjo would likely win. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
