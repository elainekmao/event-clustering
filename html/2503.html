<p>UNCLAS KATHMANDU 000379 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS AND DS/OP/NEA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:    N/A </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PGOV, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: REVISED CASUALTY ESTIMATES FOR ACHHAM AS </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY DEBATE ON EMERGENCY STALLS </p><p> </p><p>REF(S):  (A)  KATHMANDU 0377; (B) KATHMANDU 0333 </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU)  Revised casualty estimates for the Maoists\' </p><p>Feb. 17 attacks on an airport and district headquarters </p><p>in Achham indicate that nearly 130 were killed, most of </p><p>them security forces.  Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba </p><p>was expected to address Parliament the morning of Feb. </p><p>18, beginning debate on the ratification of the state of </p><p>national emergency declared Nov. 26.  The session was </p><p>temporarily suspended, however, after Opposition MPs </p><p>interrupted the Home Minister\'s report on the Achham </p><p>incident.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>CIVILIAN CASUALTIES REVISED DOWNWARD </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  Initial civilian casualty estimates for the </p><p>deadly Feb. 17 attacks on the airport, district </p><p>headquarters, police station, and Royal Nepal Army (RNA) </p><p>barracks in Achham in western Nepal (Ref A) have been </p><p>revised sharply downward.  Information to date indicates </p><p>that only five civilians--the Chief District Officer, </p><p>the local head of the National Investigation Department </p><p>and his wife, the postmaster, and a photographer--were </p><p>killed in the midnight assault on the district </p><p>headquarters.  The number of RNA killed stands at 48, </p><p>including a captain and a lieutenant, while the number </p><p>of police casualties is estimated at 76 (49 at the </p><p>police station in Mangalsen and 27 at the airport). </p><p>(Note:  Ministry of Defense tallies do not include the </p><p>police casualties at the airport.  End note.)  Casualty </p><p>figures for the Maoists are unavailable, although the </p><p>RNA has reported finding only three bodies of suspected </p><p>Maoists at Mangalsen. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) Besides attacking the District Administration </p><p>Office, prison, army barracks, and police station and </p><p>robbing a bank at Mangalsen, the insurgents also set </p><p>fire to the post office, the tax office, forestry and </p><p>livestock offices, and the Nepal Telecommunications </p><p>Office.  Communications to the district have been cut </p><p>off since 3:00 a.m. Feb. 17. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY SESSION SUSPENDED </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) PM Deuba was expected to address Parliament at </p><p>11:00 a.m. on Feb. 18 at a session originally scheduled </p><p>for debate on ratification of the three-month-old state </p><p>of emergency (Ref B).  However, when Home Minister Khum </p><p>Bahadur Khadka rose first to report on the Achham </p><p>incidents, he was immediately shouted down by Opposition </p><p>MPs clamoring for the PM to address the session instead. </p><p>Parliament was suspended after 45 minutes of chaos </p><p>(including, by some accounts, benches being tossed </p><p>around), until 3:00 p.m.  As of 4:00 p.m., however, the </p><p>session had not resumed, with the Government of Nepal </p><p>(GON) apparently resisting Opposition pressure to have </p><p>the PM, rather than the Home Minister, speak about the </p><p>bloody attacks.  The session may resume after 5:00 p.m. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  Even with the revised casualty numbers, the </p><p>attacks in Achham still stand as the bloodiest in the </p><p>six years of the Maoist insurgency.  If the Maoists </p><p>meant to put pressure on Deuba just as debate on the </p><p>emergency was set to resume, they seem to have </p><p>succeeded.  That Nepal\'s Parliamentarians could not </p><p>overcome their personal political rivalries long enough </p><p>to allow serious, reasoned debate of this national </p><p>emergency is disturbing, but not surprising.  If the </p><p>squabbling in Parliament succeeds in postponing debate </p><p>on the emergency much longer, the Maoists will have won </p><p>yet another victory--but this time without having to </p><p>fire a single shot. </p><p> </p><p>Malinowski </p><p></p></div>
