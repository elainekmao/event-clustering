(C) SUMMARY: THE CONTINUED INDEPENDENCE OF THE </p><p>ZIMBABWE CONGRESS OF TRADE UNIONS (ZCTU) FROM THE RULING </p><p>ZANU-PF PARTY, AND ITS SUPPORT FOR THE OPPOSITION </p><p>MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC), HINGES ON THE </p><p>UPCOMING CONGRESS, ACCORDING TO SENIOR OFFICIALS OF THE </p><p>UMBRELLA LABOR ORGANIZATION.  ZANU-PF IS ACTIVELY </p><p>ATTEMPTING TO BUY THE ELECTION OF A FRIENDLY LABOR </p><p>FEDERATION LEADERSHIP BY PAYING UNIONS\' BACK DUES TO THE </p><p>ZCTU.  THE SUCCESS OF THESE EFFORTS WILL LIKELY DEPEND </p><p>ON WHETHER THE PRO-MDC FORCES WITHIN THE ZCTU ARE ABLE </p><p>TO PRESENT A UNIFIED SLATE OF CANDIDATES TO OPPOSE THOSE </p><p>BELIEVED TO BE SYMPATHETIC TO ZANU-PF.  THE OUTCOME OF </p><p>THIS STRUGGLE WILL BE CRITICAL FOR THE FUTURE VIABILITY </p><p>OF THE MDC AS AN OPPOSITION PARTY, AND ITS CANDIDATE\'S </p><p>CHANCES IN THE UPCOMING PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) ON FEBRUARY 14 AND 15 LABOFF MET, RESPECTIVELY, </p><p>WITH GIFT CHIMANIKIRE AND ISAAC MATONGO TO DISCUSS THE </p><p>UPCOMING ZCTU CONGRESS, WHICH WILL BE HELD FEBRUARY 23- </p><p>24 IN MASVINGO.  CHIMANIKIRE IS THE DEPUTY SECRETARY- </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00782  01 OF 02  211005Z </p><p>GENERAL OF THE MDC, A MEMBER OF THE ZCTU EXECUTIVE </p><p>COMMITTEE, AND SECRETARY-GENERAL OF THE 7,000-MEMBER </p><p>STRONG ZIMBABWE POST AND TELECOMMUNICATION WORKERS </p><p>UNION, ONE OF THE ZCTU\'S LARGER AND MORE INFLUENTIAL </p><p>UNIONS.  MATONGO IS THE ACTING PRESIDENT OF THE ZCTU AND </p><p>NATIONAL CHAIRMAN OF THE MDC.  BOTH MEN ARE KEY MEMBERS </p><p>OF THE MDC LEADERSHIP, AS WELL AS INFLUENTIAL MEMBERS OF </p><p>ORGANIZED LABOR IN ZIMBABWE, AND PLAYED CENTRAL ROLES IN </p><p>THE ZCTU\'S DECISION TO FORM THE MDC IN 1998. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>THE ZCTU\'S INDEPENDENCE DEPENDS ON CONGRESS OUTCOME </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) CHIMANIKIRE AND MATONGO WERE IN COMPLETE </p><p>AGREEMENT THAT THE FEBRUARY CONGRESS WILL BE CRUCIAL IN </p><p>DETERMINING WHETHER THE ZCTU REMAINS A TRULY INDEPENDENT </p><p>LABOR FEDERATION OR IS COOPTED BY ZANU-PF.  MATONGO TOLD </p><p>LABOFF THAT ZANU-PF WAS INDEED PAYING AFFILIATED UNIONS\' </p><p>DUES ARREARAGES TO THE ZCTU IN ORDER TO INFLUENCE THEIR </p><p>VOTES AT THE UPCOMING CONGRESS.  HE ADDED THAT HE DID </p><p>NOT BELIEVE THIS TACTIC WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL IN </p><p>INFLUENCING THE VOTES OF MOST OF THE UNIONS\' </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES BECAUSE THEY AND THEIR MEMBERSHIPS </p><p>REMAIN OVERWHELMINGLY PRO-MDC.  CHIMANIKIRE STATED THAT </p><p>AT LEAST TWO UNION LEADERS ARE PLANNING TO REVEAL AT THE </p><p>CONGRESS THAT ZANU-PF HAD PAID THEIR UNION\'S BACK DUES. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>A UNIFIED PRO-ZANU-PF SLATE OF CANDIDATES </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00782  01 OF 02  211005Z </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) ACCORDING TO CHIMANIKIRE AND MATONGO, THERE IS NO </p><p>DOUBT THAT THE ACTING SECRETARY-GENERAL OF THE ZCTU, </p><p>ISIDORE ZINDOGA, IS A ZANU-PF PARTISAN.  ZINDOGA, THEY </p><p>SAID, WAS AGAINST ZCTU STAYAWAYS THAT PROTESTED </p><p>GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE (GOZ) POLICIES, AND OPPOSED THE </p><p>FORMATION OF THE MDC.  IN ADDITION, HE HAS TRAVELED WITH </p><p>PRESIDENT MUGABE ON TRIPS OVERSEAS WITHOUT INFORMING THE </p><p>ZCTU GENERAL COUNCIL OF THE REASON FOR THESE TRIPS. </p><p>MOST RECENTLY, HE SIGNED AN AGREEMENT TO ENTER INTO A </p><p>TRIPARTITE SOCIAL CONTRACT WITH THE GOZ AND BUSINESS </p><p>WITHOUT THE APPROVAL OF THE ZCTU GENERAL COUNCIL.  ON </p><p>FEBRUARY 10 THE ZCTU GENERAL COUNCIL ANNULLED THE </p><p>TRIPARTITE AGREEMENT ZINDOGA SIGNED.  CHIMANIKIRE </p><p>MENTIONED THE WIDELY REPORTED SUSPICION THAT ZINDOGA IS </p><p>AN OPERATIVE OF THE GOZ CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE </p><p>ORGANIZATION (CIO), BUT OFFERED LITTLE EVIDENCE TO </p><p>SUBSTANTIATE HIS CLAIM.  BOTH STATED THAT IF ZINDOGA IS </p><p>ELECTED TO HIS CURRENT POSITION, HE WOULD SEEK TO SEVER </p><p>ALL INFORMAL LINKAGES BETWEEN THE ZCTU AND THE MDC AND </p><p>PREVENT ITS SUPPORTING THE MDC IN ANY MANNER.  MATONGO </p><p>ADDED THAT ZINDOGA IS THE HEAD OF A UNIFIED SLATE OF </p><p>PRO-ZANU-PF CANDIDATES THAT WILL BE NOMINATED AT THE </p><p>CONGRESS BY THEIR SUPPORTERS. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ3365 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  00782  02 OF 02  211006Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00  COME-00 </p><p>      CTME-00  DINT-00  DODE-00  DOTE-00  WHA-00   SRPP-00  DS-00 </p><p>      EB-00    EUR-00   EXIM-01  E-00     FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00 </p><p>      FRB-00   H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    ITC-01   LAB-01 </p><p>      L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01 </p><p>      PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    SSO-00 </p><p>      STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  BBG-00   PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-01 </p><p>      DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /013W </p><p>                  ------------------C821A6  211006Z /38 </p><p>R 211005Z FEB 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 8257 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC </p><p>DEPT OF LABOR WASHDC </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 000782 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>ILAB FOR RSHEPHARD </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR BWILLIAMS </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p>PASS USAID FOR AFR/SD - DWELLER, AFR/SA - CPALMA, </p><p>NNEWMAN, AA/AFR </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL 02/21/11 </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  00782  02 OF 02  211006Z </p><p>TAGS: ELAB, PGOV, PHUM, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: CONTINUED INDEPENDENCE OF ZIMBABWE LABOR </p><p>FEDERATION HINGES ON UPCOMING CONGRESS </p><p> </p><p>WILL THE PRO-MDC FORCES UNIFY BEHIND CANDIDATES? </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) CHIMANIKIRE AND MATONGO WERE BOTH ADAMANT THAT </p><p>THE UNIONS AND THEIR MEMBERSHIPS REMAIN OVERWHELMINGLY </p><p>PRO-MDC.  AT THE SAME TIME, HOWEVER, THEY EXPRESSED </p><p>CONCERN THAT IF THE PRO-MDC FORCES AT THE CONGRESS DID </p><p>NOT UNIFY BEHIND A SINGLE SLATE OF CANDIDATES, ZINDOGA </p><p>AND THE PRO-ZANU-PF SLATE COULD END UP BEING ELECTED. </p><p>CHIMANIKIRE AND MATONGO SAID A NUMBER OF QUALIFIED PRO- </p><p>MDC UNION LEADERS FEEL IT IS THEIR TIME TO ASSUME </p><p>LEADERSHIP POSITIONS IN THE ZCTU, COMPLICATING AGREEMENT </p><p>ON A SINGLE SLATE.  THERE ARE THREE SUCH CANDIDATES FOR </p><p>EACH OF THE TWO MOST IMPORTANT POSITIONS IN THE ZCTU: </p><p>SECRETARY-GENERAL AND PRESIDENT.  CHIMANIKIRE AND </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>MATONGO BOTH STATED THAT THE MDC WAS WORKING </p><p>AGGRESSIVELY BEHIND THE SCENES, THROUGH PERSONAL </p><p>MEETINGS AND TELEPHONE CALLS TO THE DIFFERENT </p><p>CANDIDATES, TO SECURE AGREEMENT ON A SINGLE PRO-MDC </p><p>SLATE.  MATONGO WAS CONFIDENT THAT SUCH AGREEMENT WOULD </p><p>BE REACHED BEFORE THE CONGRESS BEGINS, WHEREAS </p><p>CHIMANIKIRE BELIEVED THAT THE HORSE-TRADING INVOLVED MAY </p><p>MEAN THAT AGREEMENT WILL ONLY BE REACHED AT THE </p><p>CONGRESS.  BOTH MEN AGREED THAT IF THE PRO-MDC FORCES </p><p>PRESENT A UNIFIED SLATE, THEY WILL BE ELECTED BY A </p><p>LANDSLIDE. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00782  02 OF 02  211006Z </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>THE DIRECTION OF THE ZCTU AFTER THE CONGRESS </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) IF THE PRO-ZANU-PF CANDIDATES ARE ELECTED, </p><p>CHIMANIKIRE AND MATONGO DOUBT THAT ZINDOGA WILL MAKE A </p><p>PUBLIC BREAK FROM THE MDC AND DECLARE THE ZCTU\'S </p><p>ALLEGIANCE TO ZANU-PF.  RATHER, THEY BELIEVE HIS </p><p>STRATEGY WILL BE TO PREVENT THE ZCTU FROM UNDERTAKING </p><p>ANY ACTIVITIES THAT HE BELIEVES WILL AID THE MDC, SUCH </p><p>AS UNION EFFORTS AT VOTER REGISTRATION AND EDUCATION. </p><p>AT THE SAME TIME, HE WILL OPPOSE STAYAWAYS AND OTHER </p><p>ACTIONS PERCEIVED TO BE DIRECTED AT HARMING THE GOZ AND </p><p>ZANU-PF.  HE WILL ALSO LIKELY PURSUE A SOCIAL CONTRACT </p><p>THAT THE GOZ AND ZANU-PF CAN TOUT AS A GREAT ADVANCE FOR </p><p>WORKERS\' INTERESTS. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) CHIMANIKIRE AND MATONGO WERE CLEAR ON WHAT WILL </p><p>OCCUR IF PRO-MDC CANDIDATES ARE ELECTED AT THE CONGRESS. </p><p>THE ZCTU LEADERSHIP WILL DECLARE THAT IT IS FORMALLY </p><p>INDEPENDENT AND AUTONOMOUS OF THE MDC, BUT IT WILL ALSO </p><p>STATE THAT THE LABOR FEDERATION CONTINUES TO SUPPORT THE </p><p>GOALS OF THE MDC.  IN RECOGNITION OF ITS ROLE IN THE </p><p>FORMATION OF AND CONTINUING SUPPORT FOR THE MDC, IT WILL </p><p>ASK THE MDC TO ESTABLISH A FORMAL QUOTA WHEREBY ONE </p><p>QUARTER OF THE MDC\'S CANDIDATES FOR PARLIAMENT WOULD BE </p><p>WORKERS.  THE ZCTU WILL ALSO AID THE MDC\'S ELECTION </p><p>STRATEGY BY ENGAGING IN ACTIVITIES SUCH AS VOTER </p><p>REGISTRATION, VOTER EDUCATION, GETTING OUT THE VOTE, AND </p><p>TRAINING OF ELECTION OBSERVERS.  THESE STEPS WILL </p><p>ENHANCE THE CHANCES OF THE MDC CANDIDATE IN THE UPCOMING </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00782  02 OF 02  211006Z </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) COMMENT: THE UPCOMING ZCTU CONGRESS REMAINS A </p><p>CRITICAL EVENT IN ZIMBABWEAN POLITICS.  PRESIDENT MUGABE </p><p>AND ZANU-PF WOULD CLEARLY LIKE TO CUT INTO ORGANIZED </p><p>LABOR\'S SUPPORT FOR THE MDC, AND THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY </p><p>TO DO THIS WOULD BE TO SEVER THE INFORMAL CONNECTIONS </p><p>THAT EXIST BETWEEN THE ZCTU AND THE MDC.  FOR THE MDC, </p><p>MAINTAINING THE ZCTU\'S SUPPORT IS CRITICAL TO BOTH ITS </p><p>CONTINUED EXISTENCE AS A VIABLE POLITICAL PARTY, AS WELL </p><p>AS ITS PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE\'S CHANCES IN 2002.  IF THE </p><p>PRO-MDC FORCES ARE ABLE TO PRESENT A UNIFIED SLATE OF </p><p>CANDIDATES, WE BELIEVE IT LIKELY THAT THEY WILL BE </p><p>ELECTED, AND THE ZCTU WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE MDC. </p><p>IF THEY CANNOT UNIFY BEFORE THE VOTE AT THE CONGRESS, </p><p>MUGABE AND ZANU-PF ARE LIKELY TO SUCCEED AT BUYING THE </p><p>ELECTION OF PRO-ZANU-PF CANDIDATES.  SUCH AN OUTCOME </p><p>WOULD GREATLY HINDER THE MDC\'S CHANCES IN THE UPCOMING </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
