<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 BANJUL 002394 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/W </p><p>ALSO FOR AID </p><p>DAKAR PASS TO PRAIA </p><p>DAKAR FOR RSO, POLOFF </p><p>LONDON FOR YOUNG </p><p>PARIS FOR MORAN </p><p>USEU FOR NAHAS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 9/30/01 </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, PGOV, KDEM, GA </p><p>SUBJECT:  GAMBIAN ELECTION WRAP UP </p><p> </p><p>REFS: A) BANJUL 2383; B) BANJUL 2377; C) BANJUL 2373; </p><p>      D) BANJUL 2362; E) BANJUL 2277 </p><p> </p><p>1. CLASSIFIED BY CHARGE DOUGLAS ROHN FOR REASONS </p><p>1.5B&D. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  SUMMARY: CHAIRMAN YAHYA JAMMEH WON THE 26 </p><p>SEPTEMBER GAMBIAN PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION WITH A 56 </p><p>PERCENT MAJORITY.  PRIMARY CHALLENGER OUSAINOU DARBOE </p><p>RECEIVED 36 PERCENT, AND TWO MINOR CANDIDATES SPLIT </p><p>THE DIFFERENCE.  THE ELECTION PROCESS AS PLANNED AND </p><p>MANAGED BY THE PIEC WAS PEACEFUL, CALM, AND </p><p>EFFICIENT, A FACT WHICH PLEASES MANY GAMBIANS.  THE </p><p>PRE-ELECTION PERIOD WAS MARKED BY A POLICY OF </p><p>INTIMIDATION AND HARASSMENT BY GOTG SECURITY FORCES </p><p>THAT PROBABLY INFLUENCED THE VOTE.  THE GOTG BELIEVES </p><p>THAT IT HAS MET THE WEST\'S REQUIREMENT FOR AN </p><p>ELECTION, AND WILL TAKE A VERY SOUR VIEW OF ANY </p><p>CRITICISM OF THE JUST CONCLUDED ELECTORAL PROCESS. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  THE ELECTORAL PROCESS:  AS DESCRIBED IN REF </p><p>B, ELECTION DAY IN THE GAMBIA WAS QUIET, CALM, AND </p><p>PEACEFUL.  ACCORDING TO ANDREW LADLEY, A NEW ZEALAND </p><p>LAW PROFESSOR WORKING WITH THE PROVISIONAL </p><p>INDEPENDENT ELECTORAL COMMISSION (PIEC), ASIDE FROM A </p><p>FEW INCIDENTS, THE MOST SERIOUS OF WHICH WAS THE </p><p>MOSQUE AFFAIR NOTED IN REF B, THE ELECTION WAS A </p><p>MODEL OF EFFICIENCY AND TRANSPARENCY. IN HIS VIEW, </p><p>THAT FACT ALONE HAS ADVANCED THE CAUSE OF DEMOCRACY </p><p>HERE. HE WAS PARTICULARLY PLEASED WITH THE SUCCESS OF </p><p>THE ONE-DAY PRE-ELECTION COOLING OFF PERIOD. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  VOTING PATTERNS:  THE CHAIRMAN WON WITH A 56 </p><p>PERCENT MAJORITY.  HE DID WELL IN MOST PARTS OF THE </p><p>COUNTRY.  JAMMEH PAINTED DARBOE AS THE MANDINKA </p><p>CANDIDATE (DARBOE AND FORMER PRESIDENT JAWARA ARE </p><p>MANDINKA, AS ARE ABOUT 45 PERCENT OF GAMBIANS). </p><p>JAMMEH, WHO HAD BASED MUCH OF HIS CAMPAIGN STRATEGY </p><p>ON CONDEMNING AND OVERCOMING MANDINKA TRIBALISM AND, </p><p>INDEED, TRIBALISM IN GENERAL, DID WELL AMONGST THE </p><p>MANDINKA, WINNING UP TO 30 PERCENT OF THE VOTE IN </p><p>HEAVILY MANDINKA AREAS. HE CAPTURED MORE THAN 75 </p><p>PERCENT IN AREAS DOMINATED BY HIS NATIVE JOLA TRIBE. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  THE PIEC:  THE COMMISSION ADMINISTERED THE </p><p>ELECTION WELL.  EFFECTIVE SAFEGUARDS WERE IN PLACE TO </p><p>ENSURE THE FAIRNESS OF THE VOTE AND THE COUNT.  ON </p><p>THE TECHNICAL SIDE, THE PIEC DESERVES KUDOS.  WHEN </p><p>CALLED UPON TO CONTROL VARIOUS GOTG ABUSES, HOWEVER, </p><p>THEIR PERFORMANCE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY WEAKER.  THEY DID </p><p>PROTEST THE GOVERNMENT MEDIA\'S OBVIOUS SUPPORT FOR </p><p>JAMMEH (REF E), AND THEY TALKED TO THE ARMY, POLICE, </p><p>AND NIA ABOUT DEMONSTRATIONS OF SUPPORT FOR JAMMEH. </p><p>WHEN THE OPPOSITION CONTINUED TO BE BANNED FROM THE </p><p>MEDIA AND AS THE SECURITY FORCES CONTINUED TO SHOW </p><p>OBVIOUS SUPPORT FOR JAMMEH, NO FURTHER ACTION WAS </p><p>TAKEN.  AS VICE-CHAIRMAN BISHOP JOHNSON SAID AT THE </p><p>21 SEPTEMBER, PRESS CONFERENCE, "WE SHOWED THE YELLOW </p><p>CARD, BUT NOT THE RED."  HE EXPRESSED HIS FEAR THAT </p><p>TOO MUCH PRESSURE ON THE GOTG, "WOULD RESULT IN </p><p>CHAOS." </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  INTIMIDATION AS A POLICY - WE HAVE SPOKEN TO </p><p>NUMEROUS GAMBIAN CONTACTS AND WITH ZOE TEMBO, THE </p><p>ZAMBIAN DIRECTOR OF THE AFRICAN CENTRE FOR DEMOCRACY </p><p>AND HUMAN RIGHTS STUDIES, WHO COORDINATED THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL OBSERVER EFFORT.  BASED ON WHAT THEY </p><p>HAVE TOLD US, AND ON WHAT WE SAW IN THE BANJUL AREA </p><p>THE LAST FEW DAYS OF THE CAMPAIGN, THE GOTG WORKED AT </p><p>INTIMIDATING VOTERS.  ACCORDING TO TEMBO, FOR </p><p>EXAMPLE, SOLDIERS IN JAMMEH\'S ENTOURAGE TOLD VOTERS </p><p>IN MANY PLACES THAT, "THERE IS A WAR COMING IF YOU DO </p><p>NOT VOTE FOR JAMMEH."  SHE SAID THAT THE MILITARY </p><p>ESCORT, WHICH WAS LARGE AND ARMED WITH HEAVY WEAPONS, </p><p>TOLD VOTERS THAT, "WE HAVE ONE BULLET FOR EVERY VOTE </p><p>FOR DARBOE."  ON THE LAST DAY OF CAMPAIGNING THE ARMY </p><p>SHOWED UP WITH AN ARMORED VEHICLE AND TWO TWIN FORTY </p><p>MILLIMETER ANTI-AIRCRAFT CANNONS AT JAMMEH RALLIES IN </p><p>THE BANJUL/KOMBOS AREA.  TEMBO ALSO CLAIMS THAT THERE </p><p>WAS AN NIA PLAIN CLOTHES AGENT AT EVERY POLLING </p><p>PLACE, AND THAT THE VOTERS KNEW WHO THEY WERE AND WHY </p><p>THEY WERE THERE. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  TEMBO, A VETERAN OF MANY AFRICAN ELECTIONS </p><p>COMMENTED THAT THE VOTING WENT TOO PEACEFULLY.  SHE </p><p>SAID THAT, "THE PEOPLE ACTED LIKE ROBOTS."  SHE ALSO </p><p>NOTED THE LACK OF REAL JOY AT JAMMEH\'S ELECTION AMONG </p><p>NEARLY EVERYONE EXCEPT SOLDIERS AND SOME YOUNG </p><p>PEOPLE.  A PHENOMENON SHE SAID THAT SHE HAD NEVER </p><p>EXPERIENCED IN THE AFTERMATH OF AN AFRICAN ELECTION. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) JAMMEH\'S CAMPAIGN STRATEGY WORKED.  HE HAD </p><p>SPENT TWO YEARS TALKING ABOUT THE CORRUPTION OF THE </p><p>PRECEDING THIRTY.  LAWYER DARBOE HAD DEFENDED SOME OF </p><p>THE MINISTERS TRIED BY THE GOTG FOR CORRUPTION.  THE </p><p>APRC TRIED TO TAR HIM WITH THE BRUSH OF GUILT BY </p><p>ASSOCIATION.  THE PEOPLE DID NOT WANT TO GO BACK TO </p><p>THE JAWARA YEARS.  JAMMEH HAS DONE A LOT IN </p><p>COMPARISON WITH THE JAWARA GOVERNMENT.  HE HAS BUILT </p><p>16 SCHOOLS, IS BUILDING A HOSPITAL AND A NEW AIRPORT </p><p>TERMINAL, AS WELL AS A TRIUMPHAL ARCH.  HE HAS A </p><p>STRONG BASE OF LEGITIMATE SUPPORT. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  ON THE OTHER HAND, THE OPPOSITION, IN A VERY </p><p>SHORT TIME FRAME, WITH ALMOST NO TV OR RADIO TIME, </p><p>AND WITHOUT ACCESS TO THE GOVERNMENT RESOURCES THAT </p><p>JAMMEH SO FREELY USED, RECEIVED FORTY-FOUR PERCENT OF </p><p>THE VOTE. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) COMMENT: THE APRC WAS NOT GOING TO LOSE. </p><p>THEY DREW ON EVERY RESOURCE AVAILABLE TO THEM.  THE </p><p>INTIMIDATION AS WELL AS THE VIOLENCE (REF A) AT THE </p><p>END OF THE CAMPAIGN SHOWED THAT THEY WOULD DO </p><p>WHATEVER THEY THOUGHT THEY HAD TO TO WIN.  NOW THEY </p><p>BELIEVE THAT THEY HAVE SATISFIED WHAT THEY SEE AS A </p><p>WESTERN IMPOSED REQUIREMENT TO HAVE AN ELECTION.  THE </p><p>PIEC, INVOKING THE SPECTER OF RWANDA AND OTHER FAILED </p><p>STATES, AVOIDED FORCING THE GOVERNMENT TO EITHER PLAY </p><p>FAIR OR CALL OFF THE ELECTION.  THE GOTG WOULD HAVE </p><p>IGNORED THEM ANYWAY.  GAMBIANS ARE GENERALLY </p><p>SATISFIED THAT THEY HAD A PEACEFUL ELECTION.  THE </p><p>WERE AFRAID, THE GOTG PLAYED UPON THAT FEAR, ANDIT </p><p>WORKED. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C)  THE GOTG WILL SEE ANY FUTHER COMMENTS FROM </p><p>THE WEST ABOUT AN UNLEVEL PLAING FIELD AND A POLICY </p><p>F INTIMIDATION AS SOUR GRAPES.  NO MATTER OUR </p><p>PROTESTATIONS THAT OUR ONLY GOAL WAS A FREE AND FAIR </p><p>ELECTION, THEY HAVE ALWAYS PERCEIVED US AS SUPPORTING </p><p>DARBOE (REF D).   END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ROHN </p><p></p></div>
