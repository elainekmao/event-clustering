<p>UNCLAS ABUJA 001300 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, EAID, ECON, SENV, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: AMBASSADOR\'S CONVERSATION WITH LAGOS </p><p>GOVERNOR BOLA TINUBU </p><p> </p><p>1. SUMMARY.  Recently re-elected Lagos State Governor </p><p>Bola Tinubu continues to push his three-part plan for </p><p>improving the state through privatization, housing </p><p>construction and environmental clean-up.  In meetings </p><p>July 23 with senior Mission officials, Tinubu outlined </p><p>new road rehabilitation and technology initiatives </p><p>that specifically address the state\'s decrepit </p><p>infrastructure. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  On July 23, Ambassador Jeter, Consul General </p><p>Hinson-Jones and EDDI Director Sarah Moten met </p><p>Governor Tinubu in his Lagos office.  The meeting was </p><p>followed by a tour of a new computer center in the </p><p>state government\'s office complex and a joint ceremony </p><p>to award 50 scholarships under the Ambassador\'s Girls </p><p>Scholarship Program. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  Tinubu said he plans to rehabilitate all roads in </p><p>the state, whether Federal or State controlled.  Lagos </p><p>State needs to step into this traditionally federal </p><p>role because the central government has "abandoned" </p><p>the state\'s highways by failing to pay 7 billion naira </p><p>owed to the state for road maintenance, Tinubu said. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  Road maintenance is particularly important to </p><p>Tinubu to attract foreign investment.  Tinubu said he </p><p>realizes a decrepit, over-used highway system </p><p>discourages investors of all kinds, including those </p><p>who might put money into an urban transit program. </p><p>Stating that Lagos had "cars-per-road" ratio of 222 to </p><p>1, compared to 11 for the rest of country, the </p><p>Governor stressed Lagos needs to take ameliorative </p><p>action now before the road situation got worse. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  Tinubu also wants an additional one naira per </p><p>liter increase in the fuel pump price to be directly </p><p>channeled into maintenance of all roads in the state. </p><p>"If you don\'t put money on the infrastructure of Lagos </p><p>State, you\'re just wasting it," he said.  Such a fuel </p><p>tax may result in geographic disparities in fuel </p><p>prices, Tinubu said, something that he said is </p><p>necessary to let the market decide what price is best </p><p>for gasoline in Nigeria. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  Also on the subject of roads, Tinubu praised his </p><p>meeting with NSC Senior African Director Jendayi </p><p>Frazier on the margins of the recent POTUS visit.  As </p><p>a result of the meeting, Tinubu said he plans to work </p><p>with the Governor of Georgia to improve urban </p><p>transportation in Lagos. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  With federal assistance lacking, Tinubu said he </p><p>plans to finance this work through increased tax </p><p>revenues that result from more efficient tax </p><p>collection and accountability.  In the new </p><p>Transnational Computer Technology center, Tinubu\'s </p><p>administration trains state bureaucrats to use </p><p>computers to collect, sort and check tax information </p><p>and other data like health statistics and water usage </p><p>patterns.  Through the center\'s efforts, 20 of the </p><p>state\'s 36 administrative zones are already connected </p><p>to a central database, with the rest scheduled to be </p><p>on-line by next year.  The center\'s staff said tax </p><p>revenue has already increased four-fold, with another </p><p>two-fold increase expected by next year. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. In other remarks, Tinubu said Lagos is talking with </p><p>the World Bank to install a 1000-megawatt generator </p><p>for Lagos alone so that the State can operate </p><p>independently of the national grid.  He also discussed </p><p>technical education and said he wants a series of </p><p>"alternative schools" or "community colleges" to act </p><p>as intermediate skills training centers feeding the </p><p>state\'s manufacturing industry.  Lastly, Tinubu </p><p>outlined the state\'s need for a new wastemanagement </p><p>center and his work to improve the usage of drainage </p><p>dams from 20% to 70% efficiency. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. COMMENT.  The real needs of Lagos State are </p><p>monumental and continue to challenge Tinubu.  However, </p><p>he is attempting to respond and his efforts at </p><p>infrastructural improvements are noticed and </p><p>appreciated by the Lagosians who give him high marks </p><p>for trying to build foundations for sustainable </p><p>development in the State.  Tinubu intends to follow up </p><p>his urban transportation and other development ideas </p><p>by seeking partnerships with the state of Georgia. </p><p>END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LIBERI </p><p></p></div>
