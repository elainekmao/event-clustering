No.: 25/93/ </p><p>Date: 09/06/2002 </p><p> </p><p>Mr. Thomas Goldberger </p><p>Economic Counselor </p><p>Embassy of the United States of America </p><p>Amman, Jordan </p><p> </p><p>Dear Mr. Goldberger, </p><p> </p><p>Firstly, allow me to thank you on behalf of my colleagues who </p><p>participated in the United States Department of State </p><p>Transshipment Enforcement Conference which was held in </p><p>Barcelona/Spain on May 20-24-2002, namely Messers Faisal A. </p><p>Al-Serhan and Fadi B. Makhlouf for the excellent co-operation. </p><p> </p><p>Now that the conference has finished with great success, I </p><p>would also like to pass on a word of thanks to your excellent </p><p>team, namely to Mrs. Allyson Cornish and Mr. Gabi Afram who </p><p>contributed greatly with their knowledge and efforts to the </p><p>successful arrangement of this important event. </p><p> </p><p>Jordan is suffering from terrorists attacks.  It is prone to </p><p>suffer from terrorism in the future.  It is clear that the </p><p>role of Jordan and particularly of the Jordanian Customs in </p><p>the field of nonproliferation is growing every day.  We </p><p>address our wish to receive further and more in-depth </p><p>knowledge on how the dual use of materials and </p><p>nonproliferation function in practice.  A task which stays on </p><p>the top of our agenda and for which we will be happy to </p><p>benefit from your administration\'s knowledge and expertise </p><p>which your colleagues kindly agreed to do so in the very near </p><p>future.  Taking into account the increased co-operation </p><p>between our customs department and other international </p><p>customs administrations and organizations which will only be </p><p>to the benefit of trade and economies in the region but also </p><p>the worldwide. </p><p> </p><p>Finally, allow me to express our gratitude for your kind </p><p>invitation and careful considerations which resulted in the </p><p>intention of a delegation from your side to make an </p><p>evaluation tour to our country to look at the weakness points </p><p>which will fill up the gap left by virtue of circumstances </p><p>and allow a speedy and up-to-date hi-tech. </p><p> </p><p>Looking forward to future co-operation with you and your </p><p>Customs Services.  Hoping an active participation from our </p><p>side in the coming conference in Warsaw in October this year. </p><p> </p><p>Sincerely yours, </p><p> </p><p>Mohammad F. Obeidat </p><p>Head of International Co-operation Section </p><p> </p><p>end text </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
