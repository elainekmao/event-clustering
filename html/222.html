<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 CAIRO 19680 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:   DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, PINS, PINR, PREL, EG </p><p>SUBJECT:  MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD DEVELOPMENTS AND </p><p>PERSONALITIES </p><p> </p><p>REF: ALEXANDRIA 1019 </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  A MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD (MB) JOURNALIST </p><p>(STRICTLY PROTECT) REPORTED TO EMBOFF THAT THE </p><p>ORGANIZATION IS ANGERED AT THE AUTHORITIES OVER THE </p><p>FIRST RECENT ARREST OF A "PROMINENT MEMBER" OF THE </p><p>ORGANIZATION, COINCIDING WITH THE INTERIOR MINISTRY\'S </p><p>RENEWED CRACKDOWN ON ISLAMIC GROUPS.  THE JOURNALIST </p><p>CRITICIZED THE POLICE FOR PROVOCATIVE AND UNNECESSARY </p><p>BRUTALITY AGAINST THE JIHADISTS AT AINS SHAMS A FEW </p><p>DAYS PREVIOUSLY, BUT SAID THE MB MEMBERS "HAVE ORDERS" </p><p>TO MAINTAIN THEIR DISTANCE FROM THE SUCH GROUPS\' </p><p>ACTIVITIES.  THE JOURNALIST ALSO IDENTIFIED  "EXTREMELY </p><p>ANTI-AMERICAN" ABDEL MONEIM SELIM HABBARA AS THE </p><p>SUCCESSOR TO THE LATE GABIR RIZK AS THE MB\'S CHIEF </p><p>JOURNALIST/PUBLIC AFFAIRS OFFICER.  THE JOURNALIST </p><p>EMPHASIZED THE MB\'S ORGANIZATIONAL INDEPENDENCE FROM </p><p>IBRAHIM SHUKRY\'S SOCIALIST LABOR PARTY (SLP, UNDER </p><p>WHICH MB DEPUTIES WERE ELECTED TO PARLIAMENT), BUT HE </p><p>IDENTIFIED THE MB\'S BASES OF SUPPORT WITHIN THAT </p><p>PARTY.  HE SINGLED OUT "AL-SHA\'AB" (SLP NEWSPAPER) </p><p>EDITOR ADIL HUSSEIN AS "CLOSE" TO THE MB AND A </p><p>PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT FIGURE IN ISLAMIC POLITICS, </p><p>COMBINING INTELLECTUAL LEADERSHIP WITH STRONG POPULAR </p><p>CONTACT AND SUPPORT.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>3.  NEW MB "SPOKESMAN":  A VERY ACTIVE AND COMMITTED MB </p><p>JOURNALIST (STRICTLY PROTECT) WELL KNOWN TO EMBOFFS </p><p>COMMENTED FRANKLY ON MB-RELATED ISSUES DURING A RECENT </p><p>VISIT TO THE EMBASSY FOR A VISA INTERVIEW.  HE REPORTED </p><p>THAT THE MB LEADERSHIP HAD SUMMONED ABDEL MONEIM SELIM </p><p>HABBARA FROM (EVIDENTLY SELF-IMPOSED EXILE IN) THE GULF </p><p>TO SUCCEED THE LATE GABIR RIZK AS THE MB\'S "LIASON" </p><p>OFFICER AND EDITOR OF THE MB\'S MONTHLY "LIWA\' </p><p>AL-ISLAM".  THE JOURNALIST CONFIRMED THAT "LIWA\' HAS </p><p>REPLACED IL-DA\'AWA" AS THE MB\'S MOUTHPIECE.  "SELIM" </p><p>NOW RUNS "LIWA\'" FROM ITS MID-TOWN OFFICE, WHICH IS </p><p>SEPARATE FROM THE MB HQ AT THE FORMER LOCATION OF </p><p>"AL-DA\'WA".  HOWEVER, THE NAME OF BADR MOHAMMED BADR, </p><p>NOT SELIM, WILL CONTINUE TO APPEAR ON "LIWA\'S" </p><p>MASTHEAD, BECAUSE SELIM IS NOT REGISTERED WITH THE </p><p>JOURNALISTS\' SYNDICATE AND THEREFORE IS UNLICENSED. </p><p>SELIM IS UNLIKELY TO WELCOME CONTACT WITH U.S. </p><p>DIPLOMATS, THE JOURNALIST SAID, BECAUSE HE IS </p><p>EMOTIONALLY BOTH ANTI-SOVIET AND ANTI-AMERICAN.  SELIM </p><p>IS OF THE OLDER GENERATION OF MB LEADERS, HAVING BEEN </p><p>IN PRISON CONTINUOUSLY FROM 1954 UNTIL SADAT RELEASED </p><p>HIM FROM HIS LIFE SENTENCE IN 1974.  HE HAD BEEN IN THE </p><p>GULF FROM 1974 UNTIL SUMMONED BACK TO SUCCEED RIZK, </p><p>ACCORDING TO THE JOURNALIST. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>4.  (COMMENT: A JOURNALIST AND AUTHOR HIMSELF, RIZK HAD </p><p>OFTEN SAT IN ON OUR CONTACTS WITH THE MB LEADERSHIP, </p><p>AND HAD BECOME WELL KNOWN TO THE FOREIGN PRESS CORPS </p><p>DURING THE 1987 PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION CAMPAIGN AS THE </p><p>MB "SPOKESMAN" AND PRESS LIAISON MAN.  SELIM HAS NOT </p><p>YET BECOME WIDELY-KNOWN AS RIZK\'S SUCCESSOR.  THOUGH IT </p><p>IS TOO SOON TO DISCERN WHETHER SELIM WILL PROVE AN </p><p>ACTIVIST PR MAN, THE FACT THE AGING MB LEADERSHIP CHOSE </p><p>A RELATIVELY UNKNOWN AND THUS FAR RECLUSIVE SUCCESSOR </p><p>FOR THIS POST INDICATES ITS CONTINUED PREFERENCE FOR </p><p>MATURITY AND PERSONAL LOYALTY OVER YOUTHFUL DYNAMISM OR </p><p>PROVEN JOURNALISTIC OR PUBLIC RELATIONS SKILLS.  THIS </p><p>MAY BE ANOTHER INDICATION OF THE GENERATIONAL SPLIT </p><p>BETWEEN THE MORE PR-CONCIOUS, OUTWARDLY LOOKING MB </p><p>YOUTH AND A MORE AUTHORITARIAN AND CONSPIRATORIAL OLD </p><p>GUARD, AND THE CONTINUED UNCHALLENGED DOMINANCE OF THE </p><p>LATTER.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>5.  MB-GOVERNMENT RELATIONS:  THE JOURNALIST REPORTED </p><p>THAT THE AUTHORITIES HAD ARRESTED WITHOUT CHARGE </p><p>MOHAMMED ABDEL MONEIM, "ONE OF OUR PROMINENT PEOPLE </p><p>FROM ALEXANDRIA," AND HARRASSED THREE ACCOMPANYING MB </p><p>FIGURES UPON THEIR ARRIVAL AT THE AIRPORT FROM A RECENT </p><p>MB CONFERENCE IN THE FRG.  (REFTEL REPORTS FURTHER ON </p><p>THIS INCIDENT.)  BECAUSE THEY ENJOYED PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>IMMUNITY, PEOPLE\'S ASSEMBLY DEPUTIES \'ESAM EL-\'ARIAN, </p><p>MOKHTAR NOH, AND MOHAMMED MAHDI KESHEF WERE NOT </p><p>ARRESTED.  THE JOURNALIST SAID THIS WAS THE FIRST </p><p>ARREST OF ONE OF THEIR SENIOR FIGURES IN RECENT TIMES. </p><p>THE INCIDENT HAS ANGERED THE MB, HE SAID, WHICH VIEWS </p><p>IT AS A SIGNAL OF STEPPED-UP GOVERNMENT PRESSURE ON </p><p>THEM, PROBABLY CONNECTED TO INTERIOR MINISTER ZAKI </p><p>BADR\'S CRACKDOWN ON THE ISLAMIC GROUPS SINCE THE ESCAPE </p><p>OF THE JIHADISTS LAST MONTH.  AS FOR BADR, HOWEVER, THE </p><p>MB BELIEVES ON THE BASIS OF "RELIABLE INFORMATION" THAT </p><p>MUBARAK WILL DUMP HIM SOON, ONLY TO REPLACE HIM WITH </p><p>SOMEONE "EVEN TOUGHER, BUT MORE CLEVER."  FOR ITS PART, </p><p>THE JOURNALIST CONFIRMED, THE MB CONTINUES ITS EFFORTS </p><p>TO ESTABLISH A LEGAL POLITICAL PARTY.. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>6.  THE JOURNALIST WENT ON TO CRITICIZE THE PROVOCATIVE </p><p>ATTACKS OF THE POLICE ON THE ISLAMIC GROUPS, STORMING </p><p>MOSQUES WITH THEIR BOOTS ON, FOR EXAMPLE, AS THEY HAD </p><p>DONE AT THE JIHADISTS\' "ADAM" MOSQUE AT AIN SHAMS A FEW </p><p>DAYS AGO.  SO WANTON WERE THE ARRESTS IN THAT INCIDENT, </p><p>THE JOURNALIST ASSERTED IRONICALLY, THAT "THREE OF OUR </p><p>COPTIC BROTHERS WERE ARRESTED WITH THE JIHADISTS".  THE </p><p>RECKLESS POLICE ACTION, RESULTING IN THE DEATH OF </p><p>CHILD, HAD PROVOKED NEIGHBORHOOD SYMPATHY FOR THE </p><p>JIHADISTS, HE SAID.  THE MB CONDEMNS SUCH POLICE </p><p>OPPRESSION AGAINST THE ISLAMIC GROUPS, THE JOURNALIST </p><p>SAID, BUT ALSO "DISAPPROVES OF VIOLENCE" (BY SUCH </p><p>GROUPS); THE MB LEADERSHIP HAS ISSUED "STRICT ORDERS TO </p><p>STAY AWAY FROM UPRISINGS AND ACTIVITIES" OF THE ISLAMIC </p><p>GROUPS. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>7.  MB AMBIVALENCE TOWARD U.S.:  THE JOURNALISTS SAID </p><p>THE MB LEADERSHIP HAD DECLINED TO NOMINATE AN MB MEMBER </p><p>OF THE PEOPLE\'S ASSEMBLY AS ONE OF TWO SLP MEMBERS </p><p>INVITED TO JOIN A PARLIAMENTARY DELEGATION TO THE U.S., </p><p>SIMPLY BECAUSE THE USG HAD NOT ADDRESSED AN INVITATION </p><p>TO THE MB DIRECTLY AND FORMALLY.  EVIDENTLY UNCONSCIOUS </p><p>OF ANY IRONY, THE JOURNALIST STATED, HOWEVER, THAT THE </p><p>MB LEADERSHIP AT THE SAME TIME REMAINS WARY OF ANY </p><p>OFFICIAL CONTACTS OR INVOLVEMENT WITH THE USG IN </p><p>CONNECTION WITH MB TRAVEL TO THE U.S.  HE REMARKED THAT </p><p>MB MEMBERS OFTEN VISIT THE U.S. AT THE INVITATION OF </p><p>ISLAMIC GROUPS THERE.  (COMMENT: EMBASSY HAD INVITED </p><p>SLP LEADER AND OPPOSITION SPEAKER IBRAHIM SHUKRY TO </p><p>NOMINATE TWO SLP DEPUTIES OF HIS CHOICE TO PARTICIPATE </p><p>IN THE PARLIAMENTARY DELEGATION INVITED TO THE U.S. BY </p><p>A PRIVATE U.S. ORGANIZATION.  EMBASSY EXPRESSED NO </p><p>OBJECTION TO SHUKRY\'S INITIAL INQUIRY WHETHER MB </p><p>MEMBERS COULD BE NOMINATED.  SHUKRY LATER ADVISED US </p><p>THAT THE MB HAD DECLINED TO PARTICIPATE, WITHOUT </p><p>OFFERING A REASON.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>8.  THE JOURNALIST FURTHER EMPHASIZED THE MB\'S </p><p>ORGANIZATIONAL INDEPENDENCE FROM THE SLP, BUT SAID THAT </p><p>FOUR FIGURES IN THE SLP LEADERSHIP ARE STRONG </p><p>SUPPORTERS OF COOPERATION WITH THE MB:  SLP CHAIRMAN </p><p>SHUKRY, HIS DEPUTY HILMY MURAD, PARTY ASSISTANT </p><p>SECRETARY FOR YOUTH MAGDY HUSSEIN,  AND SLP NEWSPAPER </p><p>EDITORIALIST \'ADIL HUSSEIN.  (COMMENT: MAGDY HUSSEIN </p><p>RETURNED TO EGYPT VERY FAVORABLY IMPRESSED BY HIS VISIT </p><p>TO THE U.S. IN THE PARLIAMENTARY DELEGATION.  HILMY </p><p>MURAD -- WHO PERIODICALLY "RESIGNS"  FROM HIS PARTY </p><p>POST PURPORTEDLY IN PROTEST OF ANTI-DEMOCRATIC </p><p>GOVERNMENT POLICIES -- HAD PRIVATELY INDICATED TO US </p><p>STRONGLY SECULARIST, ANTI-MB VIEWS AT THE OUTSET OF THE </p><p>SLP-MB ALLIANCE IN 1987.  THE FOUR SLP FIGURES CITED </p><p>ARE RELATED BY BLOOD AND/OR MARRIAGE TO EACH OTHER AND </p><p>TO THE LATE AHMED HUSSEIN, ISLAMIC/NAZI FIREBRAND OF </p><p>THE 1930\'S AND 40\'S.  END COMMENT.)  FURTHERMORE, THE </p><p>JOURNALIST SAID, THE MB ENJOYS STRONG SUPPORT AMONG THE </p><p>YOUNGER SLP CADRES.  HOWEVER, THE MB FACES STRONG </p><p>ANTAGONISM FROM THE "MIDDLE RANKS" OF THE OLD-TIME SLP </p><p>MEMBERSHIP, WHICH INCLUDES "NASSERISTS AND </p><p>COMMUNISTS,"  AND OTHERS, SUCH AS PEOPLE\'S ASSEMBLY </p><p>MEMBER DR. SALAH ABDULLAH, WHO MERELY "DON\'T SUPPORT </p><p>THE ISLAMIC TREND VERY MUCH."  (COMMENT: JOURNALIST </p><p>IMPLIED CONFIDENCE OF THE MB THAT ITS SUPPORT FROM THE </p><p>TOP SLP LEADERSHIP AND THE YOUNGER ISLAMIC CADRES </p><p>EVENTUALLY WOULD PREVAIL OVER THE LEFTIST SECULARIST </p><p>ELEMENTS.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>9.  \'ADIL HUSSEIN:  RESPONDING TO EMBOFF\'S OBSERVATION </p><p>THAT MANY OUTSIDERS QUESTION \'ADIL HUSSEIN\'S RELIGIOUS </p><p>SINCERITY IN VIEW OF HIS PAST AS A MARXIST, THE </p><p>JOURNALIST VIGOROUSLY ASSERTED THAT HUSSEIN HAD </p><p>EXPERIENCED A PROFOUND CONVERSION AS A RESULT OF HIS </p><p>NEAR-DEATH UNDER SEVERE TORTURE WHILE IN PRISON, WHERE </p><p>HE HAD COME TO KNOW MB MEMBERS.  THE JOURNALIST CLAIMED </p><p>THAT \'ADIL HUSSEIN IS NOT MERELY AN INTELLECTUAL OR </p><p>IDEOLOGUE, BUT HAS GOOD RAPPORT WITH ORDINARY PEOPLE, </p><p>ENJOYING GREAT POPULARITY AMONG YOUTH.  HOWEVER, </p><p>HUSSEIN IS NOT A MEMBER OF THE MB, "THOUGH HE IS VERY </p><p>CLOSE TO US."  (COMMENT: HUSSEIN IS INFAMOUS AS THE </p><p>LEADING PROPONENT OF AN AMALGAMATION OF </p><p>NASSERISM/MARXISM AND ISLAM, THROUGH HIS AUTHORSHIP OF </p><p>BOOKS ON THE SUBJECT AND HIS WEEKLY, HIGHLY POLEMICAL </p><p>EDITORIALS IN THE SLP\'S "IL-SHA\'AB".  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>WISNER </p><p></p></div>
