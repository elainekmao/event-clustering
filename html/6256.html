<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 001514 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EUR/SE (SILVERMAN, GOELLNER-SWEET), DRL/IL </p><p>(WHITE) LONDON FOR GOLDRICH, PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL, LABOR FOR </p><p>BRUMFIELD </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/11/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, ELAB, PREL, PTER, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: "NEIGHBORS" DISAPPROVE OF TURKISH CONDUCT IN </p><p>FOREIGN RELATIONS </p><p> </p><p>Classified by DCM Robert Deutsch; reasons 1.5 (b)(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary:  Comments elicited during conversations with </p><p>mission representatives of neighboring countries regarding </p><p>Turkey\'s conduct of foreign affairs suggest little approval </p><p>or admiration exists for Turkish diplomatic maneuvers.  End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  Political officer (PO), who has the Middle East and </p><p>labor portfolios, initiated a series of courtesy visits to </p><p>representatives of neighboring missions and the Turkish </p><p>Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA).  Throughout all of PO\'s </p><p>meetings with MFA staff as well as other missions, Turks and </p><p>Arabs both affirmed they had mutually good and cooperative </p><p>relations with each other.  In recent weeks, MFA contacts </p><p>have alleged that they have been primarily preoccupied with </p><p>Iraq-related issues.  At the same time, contacts in Middle </p><p>Eastern embassies say that they have had no conversations </p><p>with the MFA regarding Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3   (C) Surprisingly, the Saudi Embassy provided PO with the </p><p>first peek behind the "cordial curtain" into what the </p><p>relationship between Arabs and Turks might really be.  The </p><p>Saudi political counselor (strictly protect) described Turks </p><p>as "mukh nashif" an Arabic term meaning "dry brain" to </p><p>explain the Turks\' legendary stubbornness in business </p><p>transactions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) The Israeli DCM (strictly protect) confided that when </p><p>"\'things\' are good it is easy and when bad harder to work </p><p>with Turkey."  The DCM compares the question of Turkish </p><p>admission to the EU with getting admitted to Yale or </p><p>Cambridge:  wanting is not enough; an applicant must be able </p><p>to offer "something special." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5  (C) The Moroccan DCM (strictly protect), who served in </p><p>Washington for eight years, was exasperated after enduring </p><p>four rounds of negotiations for what should be a mutually </p><p>beneficial trade agreement between the Turkey and Morocco. </p><p>He fumed, "They act as if they are still Ottomans!" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) The Embassy of Pakistan DCM (strictly protect) </p><p>recently served in Vienna and described the Turks as </p><p>"warlike." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) The Embassy of India Second Secretary (strictly </p><p>protect) affirmed India\'s interest in assisting with Afghan </p><p>reconstruction.  The secretary noted that historically India </p><p>was not warlike, which made it possible for aggressive </p><p>nations such as Turkey to invade it. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Finally, almost simultaneous conversations with </p><p>members of the Afghan mission and the European Union\'s labor </p><p>officer elicited virtually the same response when asked to </p><p>describe their missions\' relations with the Turks:  Both </p><p>diplomats sighed, rolled their eyes, shook their heads from </p><p>side to side and waved their right hands, as to describe a </p><p>crooked river. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Comment: Strongly held historic prejudices, reinforced </p><p>by Turkey\'s current negotiations with the US and others, </p><p>suggest that distaste for Turkish-style diplomacy still </p><p>persists.  End comment. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
