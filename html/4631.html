<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ISTANBUL 002110 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR USOECD </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EAID, TU, Istanbul </p><p>SUBJECT: ISTANBUL\'S MINIATURE OECD: ENCOURAGING PRIVATE </p><p>SECTOR DEVELOPMENT IN TRANSITION ECONOMIES </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) SENSITIVE-- NOT FOR INTERNET DISTRIBUTION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) SUMMARY: Officials at Istanbul\'s Center for Private </p><p>Sector Development, a joint undertaking of the OECD and </p><p>Turkish International Cooperation Administration (TICA), </p><p>outlined an ambitious program of seminars and programs for </p><p>next year in recent meetings with Pol/Econ Section Chief and </p><p>Econ Specialist.  The center seeks to encourage the </p><p>development of a vibrant and sustainable private sector in </p><p>target regions through programs focusing on such themes as </p><p>encouraging foreign direct investment, enterprise finance and </p><p>financial sector development, investment and agribusiness, </p><p>and rule of law and anticorruption efforts.  In addition, a </p><p>handful of Turkey-specific activities are planned, including </p><p>an assessment of regulatory reform in Turkey (the subject of </p><p>a major series of OECD studies last year) and several </p><p>sectoral workshops, organized in cooperation with the </p><p>Istanbul Chamber of Industry (ISO)  As in the past, the </p><p>center will focus on bringing together a range of government </p><p>officials from transition economies to share experiences and </p><p>focus on best practices.  In effect, Center Manager Engin </p><p>Goksu stressed, the center functions as a "miniature OECD", </p><p>focusing on the Southeastern European, Black Sea, Caucasus </p><p>and Central Asian regions, but also including Russia, Eastern </p><p>Europe and Mongolia.  While primarily funded by the OECD and </p><p>TICA, the Center is also seeking enhanced cooperation with </p><p>bilateral donors active in these areas, as well as with </p><p>potential corporate sponsors of specific programs.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) A Turkish/OECD Partnership: Pol/Econ Section Chief </p><p>and Economic Specialist recently toured the spacious offices </p><p>and conference facilities of Istanbul\'s "Center for Private </p><p>Sector Development" in the downtown Eminonu district, </p><p>overlooking the Golden Horn and Bosphorus.  The new </p><p>facilities, which the center moved into last year, permit it </p><p>to organize conferences on site, obviating the need to rent </p><p>more expensive facilities at local hotels.  TICA and the OECD </p><p>jointly support the center\'s activities, with Turkey paying </p><p>for the Istanbul facilities for the center, as well as </p><p>covering lodging and per diem costs for conference and </p><p>seminar participants.  The OECD largely covers the costs of </p><p>the materials and experts who organize the seminars (Center </p><p>Manager Goksu is on the OECD\'s Paris staff), leaving sending </p><p>countries responsible only for the airfare for their </p><p>participating officials.  On average, the center hosts 15-20 </p><p>programs a year, with some 30-50 participants per program. </p><p>Goksu indicated, however, that in some instances Central </p><p>Asian countries in particular have had difficulty paying the </p><p>high airfares from the region, so that Central Asian </p><p>participation has suffered as a result.  He indicated that in </p><p>his travels through the region in recent weeks he has sought </p><p>to disseminate information about the center to various </p><p>bilateral aid missions, in the hope of encouraging future </p><p>cooperation to help meet some of these costs. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) 2003 Program: Goksu outlined an ambitious draft </p><p>agenda of 22 separate programs for the center in 2003.  Eight </p><p>programs will be devoted to encouraging foreign direct </p><p>investment, including sessions on investment in the tourism </p><p>sector (a followup to a 2002 program to assess the impact of </p><p>the earlier session), public-private partnerships, exchange </p><p>controls and liberalization and its impact on FDI, and FDI, </p><p>privatization, and environmental issues.   Special regional </p><p>seminars will address investment in extractive industries in </p><p>the Caspian region, the Eurasia investment initiative </p><p>(including the Black Sea Investment initiative), and the </p><p>investment compact within the Stability Pact and the </p><p>Southeast European Cooperative Initative (SECI).   Two </p><p>programs are planned on enterprise finance and financial </p><p>sector development, including enterprise finance and risk </p><p>capital for Federation of Euro-Asian Stock Exchange (FEAS) </p><p>member countries, and a FEAS group meeting on capital market </p><p>development that will be held in Almaty.  Programs on </p><p>investment and agribusiness are planned focusing primarily on </p><p>Central Asia (in conjunction with UNCTAD), while the OECD </p><p>itself will take the lead on a series of programs addressing </p><p>Rule of Law issues, including "Constitutional Courts on the </p><p>role of constitutional law in the economic reform process," </p><p>dispute settlement and commercial arbitration, and the annual </p><p>meeting of the Anti-corruptio network for Transition </p><p>Economies.  Finally, separate programs will address </p><p>regulatory reform in Turkey, privatization in transition </p><p>economies, EBRD programs for investors in transition </p><p>economies, sectoral developments in Turkey (with Turkey\'s </p><p>ISO), E-government and E-commerce, and WTO membership for </p><p>transition economies. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) "A Miniature OECD": Goksu stressed that the center </p><p>essentially functions as a small-scale OECD, in that it </p><p>provides a forum for officials from a range of transition </p><p>economies to come together and exchange knowledge, best </p><p>practices, and information on how policies can best be </p><p>implemented.  While the center\'s geographic range is wide, </p><p>reaching essentially from Vienna to Ulaanbator, its focus </p><p>remains on the core regions of Southeastern Europe, the </p><p>Caucasus, and Central Asia.  Officials from other Eastern </p><p>European countries and the Russian Federation have </p><p>participated as well, however, as have officials from </p><p>Mongolia. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Comment: In addition to being an important outreach </p><p>mechanism for the OECD in its efforts to work with non-member </p><p>transition economies, the center also represents a </p><p>substantial commitment of resources by the GOT.  As such it </p><p>particularly represents Turkey\'s commitment and efforts to </p><p>build bridges to its newly independent neighbors in Central </p><p>Asia and the Caucasus.  While the center has in the past also </p><p>benefited from bilateral economic assistance, in particular </p><p>from GTZ, that aid has now ended, and it is solely reliant on </p><p>the GOT, OECD and assorted other international organizations </p><p>that help organize some programs.  Goksu stressed, however, </p><p>that he is committed to seeking not just some limited </p><p>targeted bilateral assistance to facilitate attendance, but </p><p>also to outreach to the corporate sector, as the center seeks </p><p>to fulfill its mandate of encouraging private sector </p><p>development in its target regions.  End comment. </p><p>ARNETT </p><p></p></div>
