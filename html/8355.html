<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 000924 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS, INR/NESA </p><p>NSC FOR E. MILLARD </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  05/30/13 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINS, PINR, CE, Political Parties </p><p>SUBJECT:  COHABITATION TEMPERS CONTINUE TO FLARE OVER </p><p>CONTROL OF NATIONAL LOTTERIES BOARD </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  Colombo 897, and previous (Notal) </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Lewis Amselem, Deputy Chief of Mission. </p><p>Reasons:  1.5 (b, d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  Cohabitation tempers continue to flare </p><p>over the control of the national lotteries board.  In </p><p>hard-hitting letters made public this week, President </p><p>Kumaratunga has again asserted that her office should </p><p>control the board.  The government, which remains in de </p><p>facto control of the board, continues to reject her </p><p>claim.  The test of wills over the issue does not seem to </p><p>be going away soon.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) PRESIDENT SENDS LETTERS:  Cohabitation tempers </p><p>continue to flare over control of the national lotteries </p><p>board.  (Note:  In early May, the president issued an </p><p>order taking over the lucrative Development Lotteries </p><p>Board, "DLB," from the government.  The government </p><p>refused to honor the president\'s order and remains in de </p><p>facto control of the board -- see Reftels.)  In her </p><p>latest moves on the issue, the president issued two </p><p>letters that were made public this week.  In a hard- </p><p>hitting letter to Prime Minister Wickremesinghe, she </p><p>reiterated her view that she had the right to take over </p><p>the board and that her decision must be honored by the </p><p>government.  Without going into specifics, she went on to </p><p>threaten to take "necessary corrective action" if she did </p><p>not receive an appropriate reply from the PM.  In </p><p>addition, in a separate letter to the head of the DLB, </p><p>the president demanded that the board stop disbursing </p><p>funds and stop hiring personnel. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) GOVERNMENT HOLDS TO ITS POSITION:  The </p><p>government is preparing its formal response to the </p><p>president\'s letters.  It has already made clear, however, </p><p>that it continues to reject her claims.  In  May 29 </p><p>remarks during his weekly press conference, chief </p><p>government spokesman and Minister of Constitutional </p><p>Affairs G.L. Peiris insisted that the president had not </p><p>acted appropriately per the Sri Lankan Constitution in </p><p>trying to take over the board. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Citing an advisory opinion by the Attorney </p><p>General, Peiris went on to explain that it was clear that </p><p>President Kumaratunga had failed to "consult" with the </p><p>GSL in a correct fashion before issuing her order and, </p><p>thus, the order was null-and-void.  (Note:  The Attorney </p><p>General\'s advisory opinion was issued in early May during </p><p>the first days of the confrontation over control of the </p><p>board -- see Reftels.  In another aspect of its legal </p><p>positioning, the GSL has underlined that the president\'s </p><p>order was never published in the official gazette as is </p><p>required -- a fact attributable sheerly to the pressure </p><p>the GSL has put on the official printing office not to do </p><p>so.  End Note.)  Peiris stressed that the government </p><p>wanted to see the whole matter settled amicably and </p><p>through "discussion and consultation." </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) NEXT STEPS:  Next steps in the confrontation over </p><p>the board are not precisely clear.  The ball appears to </p><p>be in the president\'s court at this point, inasmuch as </p><p>the government has already made clear that it will </p><p>continue to defy her order despite her latest missives. </p><p>Contacts note that one option for Kumaratunga is to take </p><p>the matter to the legal system and charge the government </p><p>with violating Sri Lanka\'s complicated rules on </p><p>executive/legislative powers. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Reflecting on this possibility, Taranjit Sandhu, </p><p>polchief at the Indian High Commission, told us that he </p><p>thought the president might be reluctant to do this </p><p>because Sri Lanka\'s legal system is notoriously volatile </p><p>and she may be afraid of an adverse decision.  (Note: </p><p>The lower courts in Sri Lanka\'s legal system probably </p><p>tilt basically toward the United National Front governing </p><p>coalition.  The Supreme Court and its chief justice, </p><p>however, are relatively friendly to the president, but </p><p>not all cases wend their way there.)  Sandhu remarked </p><p>that he was concerned that the matter would continue to </p><p>boil, with the president and the government getting </p><p>increasingly angry.  All of this would be to the </p><p>detriment of already strained cohabitation ties, he </p><p>noted. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) COMMENT:  The test of wills over the DLB issue </p><p>does not seem to be going away soon.  There is little </p><p>sign of either the president or the government backing </p><p>down from their respective hard-line stands.  For the </p><p>GSL, the confrontation over the matter continues to be a </p><p>serious irritant, especially as it is focusing most of </p><p>its efforts toward trying to revive the stalled peace </p><p>process (and is dealing with the unpredictable Tamil </p><p>Tigers as it does so).  For Kumaratunga, the issue is </p><p>another arrow in her quiver that tends to prove her long- </p><p>time contention that the government has no intention of </p><p>treating her with respect.  These arrows might come in </p><p>useful as a pretext if she decides to dismiss the </p><p>government and call new elections down-the-road.  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>8.
