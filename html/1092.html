(C) THE CFU TEAM\'S INDIRECT MESSAGE WAS A PLEA </p><p>FOR INTERNATIONAL FUNDING TO ALLOW THE GOZ TO PROCEED </p><p>WITH A RATIONAL PLAN WHICH WOULD NOT CONTAIN THE </p><p>SEEDS OF THE DESTRUCTION OF ZIMBABWE\'S ECONOMY.

THE AMBASSADOR ALSO POINTED OUT THAT THE </p><p>ONGOING, EVEN IF DIMISHED, VIOLENCE RELATED TO ZANU- </p><p>PF POLITICKING WAS VERY TROUBLING TO THE USG AND THUS </p><p>"BUSINESS AS USUAL" COULD NOT QUICKLY OCCUR AFTER THE </p><p>ELECTIONS.

(C) COMMENT: SWANEPOEL, WHILE PERHAPS NOT 100 </p><p>PERCENT OPEN AND SOMEWHAT OVERLY ROSEY, WAS FRANK AND </p><p>CANDID IN HIS DESCRIPTION OF WHERE MATTERS STAND, THE </p><p>DIRECTION THE GOVERNMENT APPEARED HEADED AND WHAT THE </p><p>CFU DESIRED.  AS MUGABE\'S HAND-PICKED POINT MAN AND </p><p>ARBITER FOR THE WHITE COMMERCIAL FARMING COMMUNITY HE </p><p>HAS A TOUGH ROW TO HOE.  THE CFU CONTINUES TO </p><p>CONSISTENTLY MAINTAIN BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE LINES </p><p>OF SUPPORT, WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE GOZ ON ITS LAND </p><p>REFORM PROGRAM AND TRYING TO PUSH IT INTO THE REALM </p><p>OF DOABLE AND REASONABLE.  WHETHER THE RULE OF REASON </p><p>OR OF PRACTICALITY WILL SHINE DOWN ON THE PROCESS </p><p>ONCE THE ELECTIONS ARE COMPLETE LOOKS LIKE A COIN </p><p>TOSS AT THE MOMENT, THOUGH FOR THE FUTURE OF ALL </p><p>ZIMBABWEANS WE HOPE IT IS SO.
