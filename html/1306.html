SUMMARY: DONOR COORDINATION AND COLLABORATION IN </p><p>  ZIMBABWE IS A CORE COMPONENT OF THE U.S. MISSION\'S </p><p>  RESPONSE TO THE HIV/AIDS CRISIS IN ZIMBABWE.  THE </p><p>  U.S. MISSION, AND ITS E.U. PARTNERS, ARE TAKING THE </p><p>  LEAD IN THE DONOR COMMUNITY IN MITIGATING THE </p><p>  HIV/AIDS CRISIS.  THE U.S. MISSION PLAYED AN </p><p>  IMPORTANT ROLE IN MOBILIZING THE DONOR COMMUNITY TO </p><p>  COORDINATE AND COLLABORATE IN ORDER TO MAXIMIZE THE </p><p>  IMPACT OF WHAT REMAIN LIMITED DONOR RESOURCES.  THE </p><p>  U.S. MISSION SUPPORTS THE INTENSIFIED COMMITMENT </p><p>  FOSTERED AT THE QUELUZ SUMMIT TO ADVANCE U.S. - E.U. </p><p>  COOPERATION ON HIV/AIDS. END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>  2. BACKGROUND: THE HIV/AIDS EPIDEMIC HAS PROPELLED </p><p>  ZIMBABWE RAPIDLY TOWARDS A CRISIS AT BOTH THE </p><p>  HOUSEHOLD AND NATIONAL LEVELS.  THE STATISTICS </p><p>  PORTRAY AN ALARMING SITUATION: UNAIDS ESTIMATES 25% </p><p>  OF THE SEXUALLY ACTIVE ADULT POPULATION TO BE HIV- </p><p>  INFECTED AND THERE ARE AN ESTIMATED 500,000 ORPHANS </p><p>  IN ZIMBABWE. SHOCKING AS THE CURRENT SITUATION IS, </p><p>  THE FULL IMPACT OF THE DISEASE HAS YET TO BE FELT. </p><p>  GIVEN THE HIGH PREVALENCE, MORTALITY RATES WILL </p><p>  CONTINUE TO ESCALATE IN COMING YEARS.  THE HIGH </p><p>  DEATH RATE WILL RESULT IN EVEN MORE ORPHANS -- AN </p><p>  ESTIMATED 910,000 BY THE YEAR 2005. </p><p> </p><p>  3. U.S. EMBASSY RESPONSE: GIVEN THE GRAVITY OF THE </p><p>  CRISIS, U.S. AMBASSADOR MCDONALD HAS MADE HIV </p><p>  PREVENTION A TOP PRIORITY FOR THE PROGRAMS SPONSORED </p><p>  BY THE MISSION. THE AMBASSADOR MOBILIZES OTHER </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  05624  01 OF 02  041356Z </p><p>  MEMBERS OF THE DONOR COMMUNITY, INCLUDING </p><p>  REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE EU DELEGATION, FREQUENTLY </p><p>  HOLDING INFORMAL DISCUSSIONS WITH FELLOW AMBASSADORS </p><p>  ABOUT PROVIDING FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO COMBAT THE </p><p>  EPIDEMIC.  THESE TALKS SET THE TONE AND TENOR FOR </p><p>  THE REST OF THE MISSION AND HOW IT RELATES TO THE </p><p>  GOZ,OUR MULTIPLE PRIVATE SECTOR PARTNERS AND THE </p><p>  DONOR COMMUNITY. </p><p> </p><p>  4. USAID PROGRAMMING: USAID PROGRAMMING CONTINUES TO </p><p>  PLAY A LEADING ROLE IN THE U.S. MISSION\'S HIV/AIDS </p><p>  ACTIVITIES.  USAID\'S BUDGET FOR HIV/AIDS HAS MORE </p><p>  THAN DOUBLED TO USD $7.2 MILLION THIS YEAR AND </p><p>  REPRESENTS OVER 50 PERCENT OF USAID/ZIMBABWE\'S </p><p>  ANNUAL BUDGET. HIV/AIDS CRISIS MITIGATION IS ONE OF </p><p>  THE USAID MISSION\'S CORE STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES.  THIS </p><p>  PROGRAM IS A DYNAMIC AND INNOVATIVE, FIVE-YEAR, $35 </p><p>  MILLION EFFORT FOCUSED ON BEHAVIOR CHANGE, POLICY </p><p>  AND ADVOCACY AND SUPPORT TO COMMUNITIES FOR CHILDREN </p><p>  ORPHANED BY AIDS.

COORDINATION AND COLLABORATION: AN OVERARCHING </p><p>  COMPONENT TO USAID\'S HIV/AIDS STRATEGIC PLAN IS </p><p>  COORDINATION AND COLLABORATION WITH DONORS WHOM THE </p><p>  U.S. MISSION CONSIDERS AS PARTNERS.  THE USAID </p><p>  MISSION HAS TAKEN A LEADERSHIP ROLE IN HIV/AIDS </p><p>  DONOR COLLABORATION, INCLUDING ESTABLISHING AN </p><p>  HIV/AIDS TECHNICAL GROUP, WHICH MEETS BI-MONTHLY TO </p><p>  SHARE TECHNICAL INFORMATION, COORDINATE STRATEGIES </p><p>  AND DISSEMINATE RESULTS OF PROGRAM ACHIEVEMENTS. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  05624  01 OF 02  041356Z </p><p>  PARTICIPANTS OF THE DONOR GROUP INCLUDE: EUROPEAN </p><p>  UNION (EU), WHO, UNDP, UNAIDS, UNICEF, WORLD BANK, </p><p>  THE AUSTRALIAN AGENCY FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT </p><p>  (AUSAID), THE EMBASSIES OF SWEDEN, DENMARK, NORWAY </p><p>  AND JAPAN, JAPAN INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION AGENCY </p><p>  (JICA) THE BRITISH DEPARTMENT OF INTERNATIONAL </p><p>  DEVELOPMENT (DFID), SWEDISH INTERNATIONAL </p><p>  DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATION (SIDA), THE CANADIAN </p><p>  INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AGENCY (CIDA), CENTERS FOR </p><p>  DISEASE CONTROL (CDC) AND USAID.

EU SUPPORT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST AIDS IN ZIMBABWE: </p><p>  THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY IS A RELATIVELY NEW </p><p>  COOPERATING PARTNER IN THE HEALTH SECTOR IN </p><p>  ZIMBABWE, APART FROM EXTENSIVE SUPPORT TO LOCAL </p><p>  FACILITIES THROUGH ITS MICROPROJECTS FUND, SUPPORT </p><p>  FOR THE HEALTH SECTOR UNDER THE SEVENTH AND SIXTH </p><p>  EUROPEAN DEVELOPMENT FUND (EDF) WAS MINIMAL.  THERE </p><p>  WAS, HOWEVER SOME SUPPORT FOR AIDS ACTIVITIES UNDER </p><p>  A REGIONAL PROGRAM.  UNDER THE EIGHTH EDF, WHICH </p><p>  RUNS FROM 1996-01, THE SITUATION IS VERY DIFFERENT. </p><p>  OF THE TOTAL NATIONAL INDICATIVE PROGRAMME (NIP) OF </p><p>  EURO 110 MILLION, EURO 24.5 MILLION HAS ALREADY BEEN </p><p>  COMMITTED FOR THE HEALTH SECTOR SUPPORT PROGRAMME I </p><p>  (HSSP I).  THIS WILL PROVIDE SUPPORT TO </p><p>  DECENTRALISATION AND THE PUBLIC-PRIVATE </p><p>  COLLABORATIVE FRAMEWORK.  ABOUT 70% OF THE TOTAL </p><p>  FUNDS WILL BE USED TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE HEALTH </p><p>  SERVICES FUND (HSF). </p><p> </p><p>   A FURTHER EURO 30 MILLION WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE TO </p><p>PRESERVE THE HUMAN CAPITAL OF THE COUNTRY IN THE </p><p>FACE OF THE SEVERE HIV/AIDS EPIDEMIC INCLUDING; </p><p> </p><p>     A.   PROVISION OF ESSENTIAL DRUGS AND SUPPLIES FOR </p><p>       TREATMENT OF SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS, </p><p>       INCLUDING HIV/AIDS AND TB.  (THE WORLD BANK WAS </p><p>       SUPPORTING THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE IN THE PROVISION </p><p>       OF THESE DRUGS UNTIL 1999).  THE EU ALSO PROPOSES TO </p><p>       SUPPORT THE PROPOSED COMMERCIALIZATION OF THE </p><p>       GOVERNMENT MEDICAL STORES. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  05624  02 OF 02  041357Z </p><p>     B.
