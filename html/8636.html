<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 04 COLOMBO 001015 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>Department for D (Gastright), INR/MR, I/RW, I/REC, </p><p>SA (CAMP, WALLER), SA/PD (BRENNIG, IRWIN, SCENSNY), </p><p>SSA/PAS; SSO (PASS TO D); TOKYO (HARA, BRYAN) </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, OPRC, KMDR, OIIP, CE, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  MEDIA PLAY: (JUNE 11) TOKYO CONFERENCE </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary.  In the aftermath of the Tokyo Conference, Sri </p><p>Lankan English and vernacular media was in high gear.  Tamil </p><p>newspapers ran positive headlines about Tokyo\'s outcome, but </p><p>reflected concern about opposition party views of donor </p><p>money.  Tamil editorials encouraged the LTTE to return to </p><p>peace talks and discussed the international community\'s </p><p>interest in Sri Lanka.  One Tamil editorialist observed, "It </p><p>should be noted that the change of attitude of the Tigers in </p><p>seeking solutions for the problems of the Tamil people and </p><p>entering the democratic stream was a great give-in by the </p><p>LTTE."  State-owned television, radio and newspapers toed </p><p>the optimistic government line.  Opposition media headlines </p><p>were sour, but editorials lacked their usual vitriol aimed </p><p>at the international community.  Independent media coverage </p><p>of Tokyo\'s outcome was very positive.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>2. LTTE statements and other Tamil reaction. </p><p>----- </p><p>Tamil newspapers ran positive headlines about Tokyo\'s </p><p>outcome, but reflected concern about opposition party views </p><p>of donor money.  Major dailies led with headlines about the </p><p>interim administration and international encouragement of </p><p>the peace process.  Independent daily VIRAKESARI reported, </p><p>"`Government and Tigers should soon talk on interim </p><p>administrative structure - Must find solutions on the basis </p><p>of a federal a system\' - Declaration at the Tokyo </p><p>Conference."  Independent daily THINAKKURAL elaborated, </p><p>"Tokyo Conference invites Tigers to resume peace talks; </p><p>Akashi will meet Balasingham in London; Japanese Ambassador </p><p>in Sri Lanka will travel to Kilinochchi immediately," while </p><p>pro-LTTE SUDAR OLI focused on Armitage\'s comments, "All </p><p>should work with courage and achieve peaceful solution </p><p>through talks." </p><p> </p><p>The fate of donor money generated much consternation in the </p><p>Tamil press.  Pro-LTTE  SUDAR OLI headlined, "Tokyo </p><p>Conference wants GSL to assure that the funds allocated for </p><p>NE will be spent in respective areas," while independent </p><p>daily THINAKKURAL quoted Japanese Special Envoy Akashi, </p><p>"Considerable amount of the aid received would be spent for </p><p>NE." </p><p> </p><p>Nearly all Tamil dailies paid special attention to People\'s </p><p>Alliance Spokesman Sarath Amunugama\'s recent comments. </p><p>Independent daily VIRAKESARI quoted him, "No benefits from </p><p>Tokyo Conference; we will speak on this once we come to </p><p>power."  Independent daily, THINAKKURAL added, "PA worried </p><p>that the Tokyo Conference has made the Sri Lankans bigger </p><p>debtors." </p><p> </p><p>Pro-LTTE TamilNet also featured Amunugama\'s remarks under </p><p>the headline, "`Tokyo donors\' conference will not benefit </p><p>Sri Lanka\' -PA." </p><p> </p><p>Block quote: </p><p> </p><p>Sri Lanka\'s main opposition People\'s Alliance (PA) led by </p><p>President Ms Chandrika Kumaratunge Tuesday said ninety </p><p>percent of aid pledged at the Tokyo donors\' conference are </p><p>loans and not grants. "Majority of the aid given at the </p><p>donors\' conference are on various interest rates with </p><p>several conditions attached," said People\'s Alliance media </p><p>spokesman Mr.Sarath Amunugama at a press briefing held </p><p>Tuesday at the office of the Leader of the Opposition. </p><p> </p><p>End block quote. </p><p> </p><p>Tamil editorials encouraged the LTTE to return to peace </p><p>talks and discussed the international community\'s interest </p><p>in Sri Lanka. </p><p> </p><p>--- Under the headline, "Prime Minister\'s speech and the </p><p>administrative structure," independent daily VIRAKESARI </p><p>commented, "It should be noted that the change of attitude </p><p>of the Tigers in seeking solutions for the problems of the </p><p>Tamil people and entering the democratic stream was a great </p><p>give-in by the LTTE." </p><p> </p><p>Block quotes. </p><p> </p><p>The LTTE alleges that the aid received for NE would not be </p><p>spent on NE. SIHRN, a body formed as a result of the peace </p><p>talks is almost paralyzed. This made the Tigers to demand a </p><p>powerful body with more authority to handle the aid that </p><p>would be received. </p><p> </p><p>The speech made by the PM has solutions for all these </p><p>problems. SL Constitution is the barrier for all the </p><p>progress. That is why the Tigers opted to go their way. It </p><p>was a victory for the government when the LTTE agreed to a </p><p>solution through peace talks. It should be noted that the </p><p>change of attitude of the Tigers in seeking solutions for </p><p>the problems of the Tamil people and enter the democratic </p><p>stream was a great give-in by the LTTE. If lasting peace </p><p>should dawn, both parties should be prepared to give-in more </p><p>and more. Otherwise this will be an ongoing series forever. </p><p>End block quotes. </p><p> </p><p>--- Under the headline, "Two things that the Tokyo </p><p>Conference teaches," pro-LTTE daily SUDAR OLI chronicled the </p><p>international community\'s interest in Sri Lanka and noted </p><p>that the cooperation of the LTTE is necessary to reach a </p><p>political settlement and reconstruct the north and east. </p><p> </p><p>Block quotes. </p><p> </p><p>It was possible to find out about the interest the </p><p>international community has in the LTTE at the Tokyo </p><p>Conference they boycotted. </p><p> </p><p>While addressing the conference, the Prime Minister accepted </p><p>the fault of the government and pointed out that action will </p><p>be taken to establish a provincial administrative structure </p><p>with the support of the international community.  There\'s </p><p>not much of a difference between an interim administrative </p><p>structure and a provincial administrative structure.  The </p><p>international community has accepted the provincial </p><p>administrative structure. </p><p> </p><p>The Tokyo Donor Conference has stressed that government and </p><p>the LTTE should jointly continue with peace talks and </p><p>utilize the assistance provided by the international </p><p>community in a proper manner for the reconstruction and </p><p>development work. </p><p> </p><p>The international community has given an assurance to grant </p><p>USD 4.5 billion as aid instead of USD 3 billion that was </p><p>expected.  If there is progress in the peace efforts the </p><p>international community will consider more aid. The </p><p>international community is greatly interested in a peaceful </p><p>Sri Lanka. </p><p> </p><p>End block quotes. </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>3. GSL statements and pro-government reaction. </p><p>----- </p><p>State--owned television, radio and newspapers toed the </p><p>optimistic government line.  One editorial addressed the </p><p>impact of donor conditions on the peace process.  State- </p><p>owned English DAILY NEWS enthused, "Donors reaffirm </p><p>commitment to rebuilding Sri Lanka," while state-owned </p><p>Sinhala sister DINAMINA reported, "`Message given by the </p><p>Tokyo conference - a supportive tool for restoring peace- </p><p>talks\' says PM at the conclusion of the confab."  The DAILY </p><p>NEWS\' positive coverage continued, "Tokyo a new beginning to </p><p>re-energise peace process - PM," and  "We will support you </p><p>in quest for peace - Armitage." </p><p> </p><p>Under the editorial headline, "Seizing the moment," state- </p><p>owned English DAILY NEWS observed that donor considerations </p><p>".should prompt both major parties in the peace process to </p><p>carefully map out their future courses of action." </p><p>Block quotes. </p><p>In other words, the massive aid pledge is an unprecedented </p><p>vote of confidence in Sri Lanka, on the part of the aid- </p><p>giving community. Chief, of course, among the latter are </p><p>Japan, the US and the EU. </p><p>Clearly, the aid promised would be concretely realised only </p><p>in tandem with tangible progress made in the peace effort. </p><p>In other words, this is financial assistance with strings </p><p>attached. Sri Lanka would need to provide proof that it is </p><p>safely on the path to a negotiated settlement, if the </p><p>promised donor funding is to be forthcoming. </p><p>These considerations should prompt both major parties in the </p><p>peace process to carefully map out their future courses of </p><p>action. As far as the Government is concerned, it is </p><p>abundantly clear that it would want to go ahead with the </p><p>negotiating process. However, it is only fair that it is </p><p>realised that the conditions on the ground should be </p><p>conducive to a return to the negotiating table on the part </p><p>of the LTTE. For instance, the development process in the </p><p>North-East should get on to a fast track if the LTTE is to </p><p>realise that it would be worthwhile giving the negotiations </p><p>another try. </p><p>End block quotes </p><p> </p><p>---- </p><p>4. Opposition statements and pro-opposition reaction. </p><p>----- </p><p>Opposition media headlines were sour, but editorials lacked </p><p>their usual vitriol aimed at the international community. </p><p>Independent, but nationalist-leaning, Sinhala daily DIVAINA </p><p>reported, "LTTE boycotted confab to keep away from </p><p>international human rights convention,"  and echoed the </p><p>opposition\'s gripes about donor aid delivery, "PA </p><p>spokesperson says `Tokyo aid added to our debts.\'"  Sister </p><p>paper English daily ISLAND detailed the same theme, "Per </p><p>capita debt zooms to Rs. 95,000 after Tokyo Aid - PA," but </p><p>softened its coverage with," "Donors pledges $4.5 b at Tokyo </p><p>confab - Aid above expectation and foundation for peaceful </p><p>Lanka - PM."  Independent Sinhala LANKADEEPA also covered </p><p>the PA\'s comments, "[This is] not a gift from Santa - 95% </p><p>aid is debt, per capita debt is 95,000- says Sarath </p><p>Amunugama [PA-spokesperson]." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--- Independent, but nationalist-leaning, English daily </p><p>ISLAND\'s editorial comment slammed the LTTE, but reversed </p><p>its frequent criticism of the international community\'s </p><p>involvement in the Sri Lanka\'s peace process.  Under the </p><p>headline, "Boycott boomerangs!" the ISLAND wrote, ".we do </p><p>concede the conference has been a great accomplishment by </p><p>those who put it together-- US Ambassador Ashley Wills, </p><p>Japanese envoy Yasushi Akashi, Prime Minister Ranil </p><p>Wickremasinghe and Minister Milinda Moragoda.  This support </p><p>of the developed nations was . ice cold water on the </p><p>hotheads of the LTTE who tried to hijack the conference by </p><p>virtual blackmail of the Sri Lanka government and the donor </p><p>nations." </p><p>Block quotes. </p><p>Despite this newspaper\'s reservations on foreign </p><p>interference in this purely internal affair of this country </p><p>and belief that foreign assistance is no panacea, we do </p><p>concede the conference has been a great accomplishment by </p><p>those who put it together-- US Ambassador Ashley Wills, </p><p>Japanese envoy Yasushi Akashi, Prime Minister Ranil </p><p>Wickremasinghe and Minister Milinda Moragoda. This support </p><p>of the developed nations was also ice cold water on the </p><p>hotheads of the LTTE who tried to hijack the conference by </p><p>virtual blackmail of the Sri Lanka government and the donor </p><p>nations. </p><p>The reaction of the LTTE to the Tokyo Conference is not </p><p>known at the time of writing but it would be extremely </p><p>quixotic for this terrorist group to defy this well meaning </p><p>and While reconstruction and rehabilitation is a process </p><p>that can bring the two growling parties together, the hard </p><p>nut to crack is the Eastern Province with Tamils, Muslims </p><p>and Sinhalese in near equal numbers. Till that issue is </p><p>resolved it is apparent that a solution will not be </p><p>forthcoming. </p><p>We have time and again said in this column that the basis on </p><p>any agreement will be dependent on the consensus being </p><p>reached between the UNF government and President </p><p>Kumaratunga. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe has paid </p><p>very statesmanlike compliments to President Kumaratunga at </p><p>Tokyo and if this is responded to in the right spirit that </p><p>elusive consensus may be reached. </p><p>End block quotes. </p><p> </p><p>--- LAKBIMA, a strongly nationalist Sinhala daily, was </p><p>unusually accommodating on its editorial page.  Under the </p><p>headline, "Assistance required for development," LAKBIMA </p><p>commented, "What the country needs right now is not </p><p>unconstructive criticism caused by political differences. </p><p>It needs positive dialogue as to how we should use this aid </p><p>appropriately.  Being highly enthusiastic about the funds </p><p>received is not enough.  Proper development plans are </p><p>needed.  Mutual cooperation is essential.  If everybody\'s </p><p>goal is the country\'s development, it will not be difficult </p><p>to work in unison." </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>5. Independent media reaction </p><p>----- </p><p>Independent media coverage of Tokyo\'s outcome was very </p><p>positive.  Independent television and radio carried </p><p>interviews with Deputy Secretary Armitage on both English </p><p>and vernacular news programs.  Independent Sinhala daily led </p><p>with, "`Return to peace talks\' - Tokyo confab\'s joint </p><p>statement - 51 countries, 21 organizations say in unison to </p><p>LTTE."  Independent English DAILY MIRROR gushed, "World </p><p>urges LTTE to resume talks - Clear and powerful message with </p><p>whopping aid package of US$ 4.5 billion," and "Overwhelmed </p><p>Premier says `Istuti, Nandri [thank you].\'"  DAILY MIRROR </p><p>business coverage observed, "Ranil promises speed for aid </p><p>projects," and "Private sector hails donor support." </p><p>Independent editorialists were silent. </p><p>AMSELEM </p><p></p></div>
