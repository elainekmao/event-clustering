<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 005996 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>PLEASE PASS TO APRIL PALMERLEE, G/IWI </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/14/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PGOV, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: SPECIAL COORDINATOR FOR WOMEN\'S ISSUES VISITS </p><p>JORDAN </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. AMMAN 05908 </p><p>     B. AMMAN 05922 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DEPUTY CHIEF OF MISSION GREGORY L. BERRY: 1.5 (b) and (d </p><p>). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY.  April Palmerlee, Special Coordination for </p><p>International Women\'s Issues, visited Jordan Oct 5-8 for the </p><p>recent NEA Economic Officers Conference.  During her visit, </p><p>Palmerlee made a site visit to a social services center in </p><p>Zarqa and met with a GOJ human rights official and a local </p><p>human rights activist. END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>FAMILY GUIDANCE AND AWARENESS CENTER </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) On October 7, Palmerlee and poloff visited the Family </p><p>Guidance and Awareness Center in Zarqa.  Director Nadia </p><p>Bushnaq, a long-time embassy contact, gave Palmerlee a tour </p><p>of the facilities.  Bushnaq has 25 years experience as a </p><p>social worker in Jordan and opened the Center in Zarqa four </p><p>years ago (note: Bushnaq also ran for parliament in 1993, but </p><p>was unsuccessful).  The Center provides a range of services </p><p>(mostly to women), such as guidance on how to cope with </p><p>spousal abuse and raising children in poverty.  She has </p><p>psychologists and legal counsel on site and operates a </p><p>hotline.  Bushnaq has a total of 40 employees, half of whom </p><p>are "field workers" performing outreach services throughout </p><p>Jordan.  An AID funded family planning physician regularly </p><p>meets women at the Center.  The Center currently receives </p><p>funding from the EU, the UN, the GOJ, several European </p><p>governments and the Canadian government.  Most recently, the </p><p>GOJ gave the Center a 40,000 USD grant to purchase a building </p><p>for internet classes, meetings, and other activities, such as </p><p>sewing and preparing foodstuffs.  Bushnaq\'s latest planned </p><p>projects include a children\'s center in Zarqa and a women\'s </p><p>shelter.  She has received considerable media coverage for </p><p>her efforts, including a recent 40 minute interview on JTV. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  Palmerlee met with several women at the Center, most </p><p>of whom were victims of spousal abuse and/or living in </p><p>poverty.  Many of these women credited Bushnaq with helping </p><p>them to get back on their feet. One woman told of how her </p><p>husband abandoned her and left her to raise four children, </p><p>all of whom were able to complete college and become </p><p>successful people.  "I could not have done this without </p><p>Nadia\'s help," she said. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) The Center is currently developing its internet </p><p>classroom.  Bushnaq said that the GOJ and several local </p><p>companies have contracts with the Center to provide internet </p><p>instruction.  The Center also provides poor women (and men) </p><p>with the opportunity to take classes for a small fee (which </p><p>can be waived for needy students).  The Center also teaches </p><p>women how to sew and produce foodstuffs, and their products </p><p>are marketed and sold by the center.  Bushnaq says that </p><p>teaching abused or neglected women marketable skills raises </p><p>their self esteem and ultimately empowers them. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>PALMERLEE MEETS WITH NANCY BAKIR, </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS ADVISOR TO THE PRIME MINISTRY </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Palmerlee had lunch with Nancy Bakir, Human Rights </p><p>Advisor to the Prime Ministry.  Bakir has been working for </p><p>the GOJ in various capacities for more than 20 years. </p><p>Currently, she is organizing the forthcoming first ladies\' </p><p>conference in Amman, which will be held in early November and </p><p>will include approximately ten first ladies from the region. </p><p>Palmerlee discussed the issue of honor killings with Bakir </p><p>(reftel a).  Bakir agreed with Palmerlee that honor killings </p><p>are a serious matter but noted that societal attitudes are </p><p>improving and that the Jordanian media now regularly report </p><p>on honor killings.  The two agreed that more effort needs to </p><p>be made to empower women in the political and business </p><p>arenas. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p>SA\'EDA KILANI, HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVIST, COMMENTS </p><p>ON MALE ATTITUDES TOWARDS WOMEN IN THE MIDDLE EAST </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Palmerlee also met with Sa\'eda Kilani, a local human </p><p>rights advocate.  Kilani is currently working on a book that </p><p>analyzes the phenomenon of the Egyptian soap opera hero </p><p>portrayed in "Haj al Mutamudawally".  Mutamudawally, Kilani </p><p>explains, has become an icon for Arab men throughout the </p><p>region.  He is the prototype "magnanimous polygamist," able </p><p>to attract women from every social class and background -- at </p><p>all times above criticism for his behavior.  Kilani notes </p><p>that men in the region look up to him and that this, in her </p><p>view, is instructive on the general attitude that men in the </p><p>region have toward women.  "He is who they want to be," </p><p>Kilani said, although she conceded that in Jordan only 8 </p><p>percent of men are polygamists. </p><p>7. (C) On human rights generally, Kilani commented that, </p><p>"although we have a constitution here it is qualified </p><p>significantly, and there is no \'ground floor\' of human </p><p>rights," such as provided by the US Constitution to </p><p>Americans.  That said, Kilani believes the GOJ is generally </p><p>interested in the advancement of women\'s issues and rights in </p><p>Jordan.  With regard to honor killings (reftel a), Kilani </p><p>said that people had become confused between laws with regard </p><p>to honor killings and "crimes of passion," and that, in her </p><p>opinion, the GOJ should do more to clarify the differences. </p><p>Kilani said that the fact that some Jordanian women live in </p><p>fear of being killed by their husband or close family member </p><p>is tragic, and noted efforts of Royal Family members (in </p><p>particular Prince Ali) to address the issue.  "The Royal </p><p>Court, in general, is quite supportive of women\'s rights," </p><p>Kilani said </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (C)  Bushnaq\'s center is one of the most successful social </p><p>services center in Jordan and has received funding from many </p><p>international sources, including the USG.  On women\'s issues </p><p>in general, we note the Queen\'s meeting with DAS Elizabeth </p><p>Cheney (reftel b) as well as the GOJ\'s recent pledge to move </p><p>forward on a legal framework through which honor crimes can </p><p>be better addressed (reftel a). </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
