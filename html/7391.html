<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 000643 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR D, SA, SA/INS, S/CT; NSC FOR E. MILLARD </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:   DECL: 04-14-13 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, EAID, ASEC, CE, NO, JA, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  Protesting "exclusion" from April 14 seminar, </p><p>Tigers say they might not attend conference in June </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  (A) Colombo-SA/INS 04/14/03 fax </p><p>-      (B) OpsCenter-Colombo 04/13/03 telecon </p><p>-      (C) FBIS Reston Va DTG 121213Z Apr 03 </p><p>-      (D) Colombo 589, and previous </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Lewis Amselem, Deputy Chief of </p><p>Mission.  Reasons: 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) In a public statement issued late April 12, </p><p>the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) organization </p><p>announced that it was reviewing its decision to </p><p>participate in the donors conference scheduled to be </p><p>held in Tokyo in June.  The statement, which was posted </p><p>on the pro-LTTE website "TamilNet" and faxed to SA/INS, </p><p>said this "review" was necessitated by the group\'s </p><p>"deliberate exclusion" from the State Department- </p><p>sponsored Washington seminar re Sri Lanka being held on </p><p>April 14.  (Note:  The LTTE is on the Foreign Terrorist </p><p>Organization list, and, thus, was not issued an </p><p>invitation to participate in the April 14 meeting -- See </p><p>Ref D.) </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) The statement makes no direct mention of the </p><p>U.S.  (Note:  Previous statements by the Tigers on this </p><p>issue have accused the U.S. of trying to "isolate" the </p><p>Tigers by not inviting them to Washington.)  It also </p><p>does not indicate that the group has any plans to end </p><p>its engagement in the peace process.  The group, for </p><p>example, does not threaten to end its participation in </p><p>the ongoing peace talks with the Sri Lankan government, </p><p>nor does it threaten to stop cooperating with the </p><p>Norwegian-led Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission (SLMM).  The </p><p>statement, however, does hit out hard against the GSL </p><p>and the Norwegian government facilitators, complaining </p><p>that they picked the wrong venue (i.e., Washington) to </p><p>hold the seminar (as the LTTE could not attend).  The </p><p>statement also goes on to criticize what the LTTE sees </p><p>as the GSL\'s failure to draw down the military\'s "high </p><p>security zones" in Jaffna, stating: </p><p> </p><p>"The irreconcilable attitude of the Sri Lankan military </p><p>hierarchy, and the impotence of (Prime Minister) Ranil </p><p>Wickremesinghe\'s administration have made all programs </p><p>of resettling and rehabilitating hundreds of thousands </p><p>of Tamil refugees and IDPs (displaced persons) </p><p>unrealizable.  The very efficacy of the negotiating </p><p>process has become questionable since decisions and </p><p>agreements reached at the peace talks are not being </p><p>implemented (thus) eroding the confidence of the Tamil </p><p>people." </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) With Sri Lanka completely shut down in </p><p>celebration of Sinhalese and Tamil New Year, there has </p><p>been little reaction to the LTTE\'s statement as of yet. </p><p>We managed to reach two Tamil contacts, however. </p><p>N. Raviraj, a MP for the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) </p><p>who has a difficult relationship with the LTTE (see </p><p>Ref D), told us that many Tamils were talking about the </p><p>LTTE\'s statement.  Raviraj said Tamils he had spoken </p><p>with felt that it was very unfortunate that the group </p><p>was speaking of possibly boycotting a conference meant </p><p>to bring aid to the war-torn north/east.  V. Thevaraj, </p><p>editor of "Virakesari," a Tamil-language newspaper, </p><p>thought that the LTTE\'s announcement was not a "good </p><p>thing" for the peace process.  He said the announcement </p><p>was clearly sparked by the Tigers\' deep anger at not </p><p>being invited to the Washington seminar. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) COMMENT:  The LTTE\'s announcement is clearly a </p><p>highly emotional one.  In making the statement, however, </p><p>it is positive that the group did not threaten to </p><p>withdraw from the peace talks.  (Note:  The seventh </p><p>round of talks is scheduled to take place April 29 - </p><p>May 2 in Bangkok, although the venue may be changed due </p><p>to the SARS epidemic.)  That said, the language used in </p><p>the statement re the GSL is quite sharp.  The Tigers\' </p><p>threat to boycott the donors conference is a bit </p><p>bizarre.  As mentioned above, a key aspect of the </p><p>meeting is to organize assistance to the north and east, </p><p>including LTTE-controlled areas.  The Tigers, of course, </p><p>have a long history of cutting off their nose to spite </p><p>their face, but their threat to boycott the conference </p><p>could well be a bluff given their clear interest in </p><p>seeing it go forward.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
