<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 ABUJA 000873 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FREETOWN FOR MCCONNELL AND BELLAMY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12598: DECLAS 4/19/11 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MASS, MARR, NI, SL </p><p>SUBJECT: Operation FOCUS RELIEF Roundtable </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter for reasons </p><p>1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) This is an action request.  Please see para 23. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) SUMMARY: Nigerian Minister of Defense Danjuma </p><p>chaired an Operation FOCUS RELIEF(OFR) round-table meeting </p><p>on April 19.  The Minister took the role of facilitator in </p><p>the almost-two hour meeting, restating and clarifying </p><p>various concerns raised by both sides.  General Malu was </p><p>unrepentant regarding his untenable focus on equipment </p><p>rather than the bilateral defense relationship.  However, </p><p>in the end, the participants agreed that: there was a need </p><p>for a MOU to clarify all issues related to OFR; on </p><p>Wednesday, April 25, a U.S. Nigerian team would travel to </p><p>the identified training sites to look at the Chief of Army </p><p>Staff\'s proposed billeting areas for the U.S. soldiers; the </p><p>length of deployment of the Nigerian battalions to Sierra </p><p>Leone will be one year.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Nigerian Minister of Defense, LTG Theophilus Y. </p><p>Danjuma (Rtd), chaired an Operation FOCUS RELIEF round- </p><p>table meeting on April 19.  In attendance on the Nigerian </p><p>side were: Minister Danjuma, Chief of Army Staff LTG Victor </p><p>Malu, Chief of Defense Staff Vice Admiral Ibrahim Ogohi, a </p><p>representative of the Air Force, a representative from the </p><p>Office of the MOD Permanent Secretary, and Danjuma\'s </p><p>Personal Staff Officer Col Ichyaku Pennap.  On the U.S. </p><p>side were: Ambassador Jeter, PDAS-D McConnell, PDAS-S/AF </p><p>Bellamy, BG Fuller, A/DCM, DATT, OSD AF Deputy Director, </p><p>OSD Nigeria Desk Officer Ikins, JCS representative Captain </p><p>Richard Heimmerle, and PolMilOff (notetaker). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) After a 30 minute small-group meeting (including </p><p>only the Ambassador, the Minister, Mr. McConnell and Mr. </p><p>Bellamy), Danjuma invited the American side to explain its </p><p>concerns.  Ambassador Jeter said that the meeting should </p><p>serve to look at the necessary preparations for OFR Phase </p><p>3, including the issues of basing, length of deployment, </p><p>and end-use for equipment transfers. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) McConnell began by noting that a meeting between the </p><p>Nigerian and American Presidents would occur in early May. </p><p>He said that the meeting would, no doubt, include a </p><p>discussion of the bilateral defense relationship, and that </p><p>he was confident that the Presidents would be looking to </p><p>the future growth of that relationship.  That is why it was </p><p>imperative to ensure commonality of purpose in this core </p><p>aspect of the relationship.  McConnell explained that Phase </p><p>3 (P3) was slated to begin on August 27, but that </p><p>preparations would have to begin very soon.  He noted that </p><p>Phase 2 (P2), which includes Ghana and Senegal, would </p><p>commence on May 29, and added that in those two countries, </p><p>U.S. soldiers would be housed with their host battalions. </p><p>He explained that the U.S. required this arrangement to </p><p>meet force protection requirements, and because this would </p><p>allow the American and West African soldiers to interact </p><p>and learn from each other, both during and outside of </p><p>training.  He strongly emphasized that this was a mutual </p><p>training and learning experience.  In terms of basing, he </p><p>said, the U.S. would like P3 in Nigeria look like P2 in </p><p>Senegal and Ghana.  He explained that the U.S. was not </p><p>necessarily requesting that the American soldiers live </p><p>inside Nigerian barracks, but inside of the perimeter of </p><p>battalion bases.  General Fuller agreed, and noted that </p><p>living alongside of their fellow soldiers was a Special </p><p>Forces tradition and suited their philosophy for joint </p><p>exercises and operations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) The Ambassador noted that it would be a good idea to </p><p>have an "off-site" for officers from the Special Forces </p><p>team and the Nigeria battalion participating in OFR P3 </p><p>before P3 began.  This would allow the officers to get to </p><p>know each other on a personal basis, generate mutual </p><p>understanding, and would also give the Special Forces </p><p>soldiers a chance to learn Nigerian culture from their </p><p>hosts.  Ambassador Jeter offered Embassy assistance for </p><p>such a meeting.  (COMMENT: There seemed to be general MOD </p><p>civilian support for this idea, though Malu and Ogohi </p><p>remained silent.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Malu then addressed his concerns, first by noting </p><p>that he believed the misunderstandings in Phase 1 (P1) </p><p>occurred because the training did not take place as </p><p>originally envisioned.  The Nigerian Army, he said, was </p><p>appreciative of and excited by the U.S. offer of </p><p>assistance.  However, the Service Chiefs had wanted to know </p><p>what equipment would be supplied (he said that the </p><p>equipment list for P1 was not passed to them until the </p><p>training began), and had expected the training to focus on </p><p>equipment not regularly found in the Nigeria inventory. </p><p>8. (C) Malu emphasized that, while grateful for the offer </p><p>to equip the battalions, he had expected the U.S. to </p><p>provide the type of logistical support his ECOMOG forces </p><p>had received in Liberia through PA&E.  He objected to </p><p>training in tactics because he did not want five Nigerian </p><p>battalions that had a different doctrine than the rest of </p><p>the Army.  He added that, when a Nigerian battalion is </p><p>selected for peacekeeping duty, they are already given </p><p>three months to train and prepare for the mission.  For P3, </p><p>Malu noted, the training should be based on the equipment </p><p>that would be provided, and that equipment should be items </p><p>that the Nigerian Army does not already have (he explained </p><p>that the Army has plenty of rifles, but needed more items </p><p>like machine guns and RPG:). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) The Minister then asked Malu to address the issue of </p><p>co-locating the soldiers.  Malu said he would not mind </p><p>locating space "outside the barracks", and allowing the </p><p>U.S. to assess the locations for security. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) McConnell responded that the equipment for P3 would </p><p>be the same as P1.  He explained that this had been </p><p>discussed before P1 had begun, and was based on limited </p><p>U.S. resources (USD 90 million) to fund OFR for seven West </p><p>African battalions (including the cost of equipment and the </p><p>soldiers).  The U.S. had agreed to weapons and equipment </p><p>for individual soldiers, crew served weapons (machine guns </p><p>and mortars), communications gear, medical equipment and </p><p>vehicles.  Moreover, the equipment was selected with </p><p>attention given to compatibility with Nigerian Army </p><p>equipment.  There had never been any U.S. suggestion of </p><p>equipping to UN scale, McConnell added. The training and </p><p>equipment "had to be a package deal," because the USG was </p><p>unable to provide lethal assistance without training and </p><p>still meet Congressional concerns.  Finally, McConnell </p><p>said, there was certainly a benefit to soldiers being </p><p>together, interacting, and exercising together, regardless </p><p>of the equipment or POI.  OFR was in the national interest </p><p>of both countries, and deserved support. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) The Ambassador explained to General Malu that the </p><p>kind of support he had received in Liberia from the U.S. </p><p>was still available, but in Sierra Leone it would be </p><p>provided by the UN.  OFR, the Ambassador noted, should be </p><p>looked at as the beginning of a process to build capacity </p><p>in the sub-region to deal with conflict as well as natural </p><p>disasters.  This went beyond ACRI, he said.  McConnell </p><p>noted that ACRI was moving from State to DOD, and the U.S. </p><p>would seek Nigeria\'s feedback on ACRI thus far.  ACRI would </p><p>have to make sense to Nigeria, McConnell said, because </p><p>Nigeria was a critical component. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) Malu returned to Liberia, and noted that PA&E </p><p>support there had been extremely important.  He added that </p><p>if he had had the choice of the PA&E support or an equal </p><p>amount of money, he would have chosen PA&E.  He asked why </p><p>the U.S. was not giving PA&E support to Nigeria now? </p><p>McConnell responded that constantly using PA&E would not </p><p>allow for the growth of the bilateral defense relationship. </p><p>In that case, Malu said, it would be better to give Nigeria </p><p>additional course vacancies through IMET, and then try to </p><p>do joint exercises in the future when the Nigerian Army </p><p>would be better prepared to participate.  He added that </p><p>every battalion slated for OFR had been to either Liberia </p><p>or Sierra Leone at least three times (implying a high level </p><p>of tactical combat experience and no need for additional </p><p>training). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) Minister Danjuma noted that General Malu was </p><p>arguing that if the current equipment scale was maintained, </p><p>then the POI should be shorter.  General Fuller stated that </p><p>the POI could be reviewed, but he did not believe it could, </p><p>or necessarily should, be shorter.  Moreover, EUCOM had </p><p>reviewed the P1 POI, and had already incorporated </p><p>suggestions from the Nigerian battalions who had </p><p>participated.  Finally, the POI was not just about the </p><p>equipment, but also about interaction of the soldiers. </p><p>McConnell reiterated that he believed both Nigerian and </p><p>American soldiers had gained a great deal in P1, and </p><p>rhetorically asked, "What is the downside to joint </p><p>training?" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. (C)  Chief of Defense Staff Ogohi then identified four </p><p>areas of concern: (a) If OFR training was just for Sierra </p><p>Leone-bound units, or if other Nigerian soldiers could gain </p><p>from it; (b) the need for a MOU; (c) his concern that the </p><p>UN mandate in Sierra Leone could end and that therefore, </p><p>August was a late starting date; and, (d) that basing had </p><p>to be decided by the Chief of Army Staff, and that the </p><p>Nigerian Army would provide for security. McConnell agreed </p><p>on the need for a MOU, and offered to provide a draft </p><p>document to the MOD.  On the UN mandate, McConnell </p><p>explained that no one could tell the future.  August had </p><p>been selected because of the time needed for preparations. </p><p>The Ambassador added that Nigeria was in P3 because the </p><p>U.S. could not get the necessary answers to put Nigeria in </p><p>P2 starting in May.  Moreover, McConnell pointed out, while </p><p>OFR was just a piece of the bilateral defense arrangement, </p><p>OFR could be used as an opportunity to demonstrate to the </p><p>U.S. Congress the validity of expanding the overall defense </p><p>relationship.  On basing, McConnell said he understood from </p><p>earlier comments that Nigeria had agreed that the U.S. </p><p>soldiers could live on the bases outside of the actual </p><p>barracks, that is, working the base perimeter. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15. (C) General Malu then returned to his concern that five </p><p>Nigerian battalions would learn different tactics and </p><p>doctrine than the rest of the Army.  General Fuller </p><p>explained that while this was ultimately a Nigerian </p><p>decision, the training was not on peacekeeping skills but </p><p>on combat operations, and that most of the skills could be </p><p>easily transferred.  We will move quickly and finish early </p><p>if standards are met, General Fuller added. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16. (C)  The Minister then said that the length of </p><p>deployment would be for one year, which was then confirmed </p><p>by Malu and Ogohi.  Returning to basing, the Minister </p><p>suggested that a team of Nigerians and Americans go to the </p><p>sites and see if the U.S. could accept the sites chosen by </p><p>the Army.  The Ambassador pointed out that four bases were </p><p>under discussion (three with the battalions and the forward </p><p>operating base (FOB) in Abuja), and asked if site surveys </p><p>had already been done.  Colonel Nelson affirmed that </p><p>surveys had been done, that he had sent a letter requesting </p><p>use of the FOB, and plans had been drawn up.  He had </p><p>believed that the notion of a "base-within-a-base" had been </p><p>accepted, but then learned that it had not seen. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>17. (C)  General Malu returned the discussion to the POI, </p><p>and said that the Army should give input into the POI. </p><p>General Fuller explained that the POI had in fact been </p><p>negotiated last summer, but that it could be reviewed </p><p>again.  However, he did not see much flexibility in </p><p>adjusting the length of the POI.  McConnell agreed that the </p><p>length of the POI could not be changed, but that changes in </p><p>the actual instruction could be discussed.  Malu again </p><p>noted his concerns regarding doctrine, stating that the </p><p>Commanding Officers from P1 had expressed concern about the </p><p>POI changing Army doctrine.  McConnell responded that the </p><p>POI focused on small unit tactics, not on doctrine.  Fuller </p><p>added that the ideas of the Commanding Officers of the </p><p>battalions from P1 had been integrated into the newest </p><p>version of the POI.  He noted that he would be happy to </p><p>meet with the Commanding Officers of the remaining three </p><p>battalions and incorporate their ideas. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>18. (C) Bellamy then addressed General Malu\'s comments </p><p>about the equipment, clarifying that it had already been </p><p>determined that the equipment in P3 would be the same as </p><p>P1.  General Malu again stated that he would have liked to </p><p>replace the rifles (of which the Army has enough) with more </p><p>machine guns or RPGs.  (DAO COMMENT:  Despite Malu\'s </p><p>comments, Nigerian Army rifles are generally in very poor </p><p>condition and not fit for combat.  END DAO COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>19. (C)  The Minister then summarized the meeting, which he </p><p>described as very useful.  He noted that that: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>- There is a need for a MOU to clarify equipment and other </p><p>issues </p><p>- On Wednesday, April 25, a Nigerian and a USG </p><p>representative would travel to the bases to look at the </p><p>Chief of Army Staff\'s proposed basing options for the U.S. </p><p>soldiers.  He added that adjustments could be made to </p><p>General Malu\'s proposals. </p><p>- Deployment of the Nigerian battalions to Sierra Leone </p><p>will be for one year. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>20. (C) Finally, the Ambassador raised the issue of the </p><p>trucks provided in Nigeria to the battalions during P1, </p><p>which had not been shipped to Sierra Leone as agreed.  The </p><p>Minister instructed General Malu to look into the trucks. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>21. (C) COMMENT: A number of positive conclusions were </p><p>reached in the meeting, including length of deployment and </p><p>a clear acknowledgement of U.S. concerns for force </p><p>protection.  Moreover, a clearing of the air on various </p><p>issues was certainly healthy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>22. (C) COMMENT CONTINUED:  Minister Danjuma was </p><p>impressive.  The normally reserved Minister took control of </p><p>the discussion at a number of points, redirecting the </p><p>discussion to the key issues at hand.  However, it was also </p><p>clear that he was hesitant to force a confrontation with </p><p>Malu or Ogohi.  The ultimate test of wills will come during </p><p>the inspection of the proposed sites for bases for U.S. </p><p>trainers.  OFR P3 for Nigeria could still collapse if </p><p>General Malu\'s notions do not meet with U.S. requirements, </p><p>and the U.S. inspectors are required to reject the options </p><p>he offers.  Malu certainly understands this.  In this case, </p><p>we will see how far the Nigerian political decision-makers </p><p>are willing to enforce their authority to continue a </p><p>program they clearly support. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>23. (C) ACTION REQUEST:  Post faxed a draft MOU to AF/W and </p><p>AF/RA for an initial review.  The document was reviewed and </p><p>edited in Abuja by PDAS-D McConnell, PDAS-S/AF Bellamy and </p><p>General Fuller.  Post requests quick coordination by the </p><p>Department to provide a draft MOU that we can forward to </p><p>the Minister for his comment.  END ACTION REQUEST. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>24. (U) This cable was not cleared by PDAS-D McConnell, </p><p>PDAS-S/AF Bellamy, or General Fuller. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>25. (U) Freetown minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
