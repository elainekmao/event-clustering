<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 LAGOS 000470 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, EINV, EAID, PINS, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: OUTREACH TO NCEMA AND NISER </p><p> </p><p>1.  Introduction and summary.  Staff of ConGen\'s Economic </p><p>Office reached out to two institutions of learning in the </p><p>city of Ibadan in Oyo State on February 25. This former </p><p>capital of Nigeria\'s old Western State is notable for </p><p>several research institutions including the University of </p><p>Ibadan, the premier institution of higher learning in </p><p>Nigeria. This report focuses on two key centers of learning, </p><p>the National Center For Economic Management and </p><p>Administration (NCEMA), and the Nigerian Institute of Social </p><p>and Economic Research (NISER.) International donors who </p><p>appreciate their activities should be able to work with </p><p>these institutions to leverage their own resources as they </p><p>seek to help Nigerians in the public and private sectors. </p><p>End introduction and summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>The Nigerian Center for Economic Management </p><p>and Administration </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. NCEMA,the younger of the two Nigerian institutions, was </p><p>established by the federal government in 1986.  The center </p><p>provides training to federal government officials who </p><p>formulate economic policies. Federal staff come from the </p><p>Central Bank of Nigeria, the Budget office in the Federal </p><p>Minister of Finance, and the National Planning Commission. </p><p>State civil servants also participate in these programs. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>NCEMA\'s Research Approach </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  NCEMA approaches problem solving through policy </p><p>research.  Professor Mike Obadan, the Director General of </p><p>NCEMA, said the Center\'s products are results oriented. </p><p>NCEMA\'s faculty comprises 22 researchers who also serve as </p><p>consultants to other institutions.  The Center runs seminars </p><p>and symposiums annually.  Among the former is an annual </p><p>federal budget seminar. Faculty members and other solicited </p><p>public officials often make presentations on topics of their </p><p>choice. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>Efforts at Capacity Building </p><p>for GON Officials </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  NCEMA organizes budget workshops for the staff of the </p><p>National Assembly and the Assembly members too.  NCEMA aims </p><p>to enhance their understanding of the budget process and its </p><p>implementation, to enable them contribute informed input or </p><p>amendments to the federal budget before its approval. The </p><p>Center is conducting a survey of corruption and governance </p><p>as well. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>Relationship with International Agencies </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  The World Bank collaborates with NCEMA on several </p><p>aspects of economic management and capacity building.  NCEMA </p><p>provides a training ground for Bank projects on capacity </p><p>building. Obadan said the Center formerly was linked with </p><p>the University of Bradford in the United Kingdom. NCEMA is </p><p>looking for opportunities to establish links with American </p><p>institutions. Professor Obadan expressed interest in </p><p>establishing a closer relationship with USAID. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>The Nigerian Institute of </p><p>Social and Economic Research </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.   NISER was established in 1950 during British rule in </p><p>Nigeria. The institute was then called WAISER (West African </p><p>Institute of Social and Economic Research) and focused its </p><p>research on the socioeconomic needs of the West African </p><p>countries under British rule.  At independence, the former </p><p>British colonies went their own way.  NISER was transformed </p><p>into an institute at the Nigeria\'s premier university, the </p><p>University of Ibadan. By 1977, NISER\'s "six-and-a-half" </p><p>research departments had become semi-autonomous. NISER\'s </p><p>researchers cover agriculture and rural development, </p><p>economic development, human resources development, physical </p><p>development, social development, technology policy and </p><p>development, and political development. What NISER staff </p><p>call its "half" department is the Center for African </p><p>Resources, a department with ad hoc staff pulled from </p><p>NISER\'s different research units. NISER has 60 full-time </p><p>professional researchers and its total staff numbers 400. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>NISER Research Projects </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>7.  Professor Olu Ajakaiye, Director General of NISER, said </p><p>NISER staff focus on four broad areas of activity. The first </p><p>is individual research designed mainly to sharpen the skills </p><p>of research staff. NISER\'s review of Nigerian developments </p><p>and its futures research also keep research staff abreast of </p><p>developments in the various spheres of Nigerian life. NISER </p><p>staff conduct annual monitoring research during which </p><p>NISER\'s research units audit their own performance.  Lastly, </p><p>NISER provides consulting services to third parties. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. NISER\'s Director General expects its researchers to spend </p><p>at least 50 percent of their time on research projects. </p><p>NISER has a close relationship with some government </p><p>agencies, such as the Central Bank of Nigeria, and is a </p><p>think-tank to other government agencies. </p><p>9. In collaboration with the World Bank, NISER hosted </p><p>seminars and workshops and provided input to Nigeria\'s five- </p><p>year development plans prior to Nigeria\'s implementation of </p><p>the first structural adjustment program (SAP) in 1986. The </p><p>SAP led to de-emphasis of long-range planning and emphasis </p><p>on short-term policy management.  NISER has since been </p><p>conducting research on Nigeria\'s social and economic </p><p>development and on its prospects.  NISER\'s research </p><p>documents often take the form of policy memoranda. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>On-Going Relationship </p><p>with Donor Agencies </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. NISER is working on the GON\'s poverty reduction strategy </p><p>program (PRSP). NISER hopes its research will lead to its in- </p><p>depth understanding of poverty so to make substantive input </p><p>to the PRSP.  NISER is executing a USAID-funded project on </p><p>legislative support to Nigerian states in collaboration with </p><p>the Mississippi Consortium for International Development. </p><p>Six states are benefiting from the program, which </p><p>essentially involves capacity building. NISER is carrying </p><p>out a corruption survey in collaboration with the Ahmadu </p><p>Bello University in Zaria, which is also funded by USAID. </p><p>And NISER is pursuing comparative research with Canada\'s </p><p>International Development Research Center and its African </p><p>affiliate, the Secretariat for International Support for </p><p>Economic Research in Africa. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  NISER has a clear vision of where it wants to go. It </p><p>wants to augment capacity within Nigeria\'s civil service by </p><p>being the instrument of choice for restructuring the service </p><p>through short- and long-term training. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  Comment.  NCEMA and NISER potentially can play </p><p>important roles in shaping Nigeria\'s economic policies. </p><p>These institutions boast faculty members well grounded in </p><p>divers aspects of economic policy. The donors who appreciate </p><p>their activities should be able to work with these </p><p>institutions to leverage their own resources as they seek to </p><p>help Nigerians in the public and private sectors. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HINSON-JONES </p><p></p></div>
