IN OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY, </p><p>VIOLENCE CONTINUES TO SPREAD, MORE ROADBLOCKS ARE BEING </p><p>ERECTED, SAFEHOUSES FOR REFUGEES FROM POLITICAL </p><p>VIOLENCE ARE BEING RAIDED, AND THE GOZ IS PREPARING TO </p><p>SEIZE FIREARMS BELONGING TO COMMERCIAL FARMERS, THEREBY </p><p>REMOVING THEIR LAST LINE OF DEFENSE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>MDC RALLY BLOCKED </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) POLICE AND ZANU-PF MILITANTS BLOCKED A PLANNED </p><p>MDC RALLY AT BULAWAYO\'S WHITE CITY STADIUM ON JANUARY </p><p>20.  MDC SECRETARY-GENERAL WELSHMAN NCUBE TOLD </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00211  01 OF 02  231638Z </p><p>JOURNALISTS ZANU-PF SUPPORTERS HAD OCCUPIED THE STADIUM </p><p>TO PREVENT THE RALLY FROM BEING HELD, WHILE POLICE BEAT </p><p>AND FIRED TEARGAS AT 8,000 - 10,000 MDC SUPPORTERS </p><p>WAITING TO ENTER THE STADIUM.  ACCORDING TO PRESS </p><p>REPORTS, AT LEAST 20 MDC SUPPORTERS WERE INJURED IN THE </p><p>MELEE, AND ONE OF THE VICTIMS WAS ADMITTED TO AN </p><p>INTENSIVE CARE UNIT WITH A SERIOUS HEAD INJURY.  SEVEN </p><p>MDC SUPPORTERS WENT MISSING, ACCORDING TO NCUBE.  A </p><p>POLICE SPOKESMAN DENIED CHARGES OF PARTISANSHIP, </p><p>CLAIMING THAT THE POLICE HAD ACTED TO "STOP VIOLENCE </p><p>BETWEEN SUPPORTERS OF TWO PARTIES." </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) MDC VICE-PRESIDENT GIBSON SIBANDA, WHO WAS THE </p><p>SENIOR PARTY OFFICIAL SCHEDULED TO ADDRESS THE RALLY, </p><p>TOLD POLITICAL SECTION CHIEF THAT THE MDC HAD INFORMED </p><p>THE POLICE THREE WEEKS IN ADVANCE OF THE PLANNED RALLY </p><p>AND HAD OBTAINED PERMITS AUTHORIZING THE EVENT FROM </p><p>BOTH THE POLICE AND THE CITY COUNCIL.  ACCORDING TO </p><p>SIBANDA, THE NIGHT BEFORE THE RALLY, SEVERAL HUNDRED </p><p>ZANU-PF SUPPORTERS CAMPED OUT INSIDE THE STADIUM IN A </p><p>CLEAR ATTEMPT TO DISRUPT THE FOLLOWING DAY\'S RALLY. </p><p>SIBANDA CLAIMED GOVERNMENT VEHICLES TRANSPORTED THE </p><p>GROUP THERE AFTER ATTENDING A ZANU-PF RALLY ADDRESSED </p><p>BY VICE-PRESIDENT JOSEPH MSIKA AND RULING PARTY </p><p>COMMISSAR ELLIOTT MANYIKA IN INYATHI, 50 KM NORTHEAST </p><p>OF BULAWAYO.  SIBANDA SAID THERE WAS NO QUESTION IN HIS </p><p>MIND THAT MSIKA AND MANYIKA HAD INSTRUCTED THEIR </p><p>SUPPORTERS TO BLOCK THE RALLY.  AFTER HE AND MDC </p><p>SECRETARY-GENERAL WELSHMAN NCUBE FAILED TO CONVINCE THE </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>SENIOR POLICE OFFICER PRESENT TO EVICT THE ZANU-PF </p><p>SUPPORTERS INSIDE SO THAT THE RALLY COULD TAKE PLACE, A </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00211  01 OF 02  231638Z </p><p>MELEE ENSUED BETWEEN THE IRATE MDC SUPPORTERS OUTSIDE </p><p>AND THE RIOT POLICE, WITH THE FORMER THROWING STONES </p><p>AND THE LATTER FIRING TEARGAS AND BEATING PEOPLE IN THE </p><p>CROWD.  IN ADDITION TO THE PERSON ADMITTED TO THE </p><p>INTENSIVE CARE UNIT, SIBANDA SAID A NUMBER OF MDC </p><p>SUPPORTERS HAD BEEN STABBED. </p><p> </p><p>VIOLENCE SPREADS </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) MEANWHILE, WAR VETERANS AND THE RECENTLY- </p><p>INAUGURATED YOUTH BRIGADES HAVE CONTINUED TO EXPAND </p><p>THEIR CAMPAIGN EFFORTS ON BEHALF OF ZANU-PF.  PHYSICAL </p><p>VIOLENCE CONTINUES TO BE THE PRIMARY TACTIC OF CHOICE. </p><p>ON JANUARY 13, MDC MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT WAS STABBED IN </p><p>THE ABDOMEN BY A GROUP OF ZANU-PF SUPPORTERS AFTER THEY </p><p>ABDUCTED HIM FROM LUPANE BUSINESS CENTER, ABOUT 160 </p><p>KILOMETERS NORTHWEST OF BULAWAYO.  HE WAS DUMPED SIX </p><p>KILOMETERS FROM THE BUSINESS CENTER, UNCONSCIOUS AND </p><p>BLEEDING.  ACCORDING TO LEARNMORE JONGWE, THE MDC\'S </p><p>SPOKESMAN, ZANU-PF MILITANTS KILLED THREE MDC MEMBERS </p><p>AND A FOURTH PASSERBY IN ZAKA DISTRICT, MASVINGO </p><p>PROVINCE, OVER THE PAST WEEK.

ACCORDING TO NUMEROUS </p><p>ANECDOTAL REPORTS, SIMILAR INCIDENTS OF BEATINGS </p><p>PERPETRATED PREDOMINANTLY BY ZANU-PF SUPPORTERS -- </p><p>INCLUDING INFLICTION OF SERIOUS PHYSICAL INJURY -- ARE </p><p>HAPPENING NATIONWIDE.   WE HAVE EVEN RECEIVED FIRST- </p><p>HAND REPORTS OF ZANU-PF SUPPORTERS BEATING RULING PARTY </p><p>MEMBERS WHO ARE NOT MILITANT ENOUGH OR HAVE THE GALL TO </p><p>MAINTAIN GOOD RELATIONS WITH PEOPLE ON THE OTHER SIDE </p><p>OF THE POLITICAL AISLE. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) IN ADDITION, WE RECEIVE REGULAR REPORTS OF </p><p>ROADBLOCKS BEING ERECTED AROUND THE COUNTRY, MOSTLY </p><p>AWAY FROM MAIN THOROUGHFARES IN MORE ISOLATED AREAS, </p><p>WHERE VEHICLE OCCUPANTS NOT IN POSSESSION OF ZANU-PF </p><p>CARDS ARE SUBJECTED TO PHYSICAL AND VERBAL ABUSE.  IN </p><p>SOME CASES, THOSE MANNING THE ROADBLOCKS SEIZE NATIONAL </p><p>IDENTITY DOCUMENTS OF THOSE WHO CANNOT PRODUCE ZANU-PF </p><p>CARDS, MEANING THEY MAY BE UNABLE TO VOTE IN THE </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) IN ANOTHER RECENT DEVELOPMENT THAT HAS CAUSED </p><p>STRONG CONCERN AMONG HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS, THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE HAS ZEROED IN ON SAFEHOUSES </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00211  02 OF 02  231639Z </p><p>OPERATED BY THE WELL-RESPECTED HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>ORGANIZATION AMANI TRUST FOR VICTIMS OF POLITICAL </p><p>VIOLENCE.  THE GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED MEDIA HAVE RUN </p><p>VITRIOLIC FRONT-PAGE STORIES DURING THE PAST WEEK </p><p>DESCRIBING THE SAFEHOUSES AS "KILLER HOUSES" INTENDED </p><p>TO HIDE MDC MURDERERS AND PERPETRATORS OF VIOLENCE </p><p>WANTED BY THE POLICE.  AMANI TRUST DIRECTOR TONY REELER </p><p>TOLD US THAT "THE GUYS IN DARK GLASSES" HAVE SHOWN UP </p><p>AT MANY OF THE SAFEHOUSES ASKING QUESTIONS AND </p><p>DEMANDING WRITTEN RECORDS.  GIVEN THE INFLAMMATORY TONE </p><p>OF THE RECENT PRESS ARTICLES, REELER FULLY EXPECTS THE </p><p>WAR VETERANS OR YOUTH BRIGADES TO ATTACK THE OCCUPANTS </p><p>SOON.  TO TRY TO PREEMPT SUCH AN ATTACK, AMANI TRUST IS </p><p>DIVIDING THE OCCUPANTS -- MANY OF WHOM HAVE BEEN BADLY </p><p>INJURED OR SEVERELY TRAUMATIZED -- INTO SMALLER GROUPS </p><p>AND MOVING THEM TO NEW LOCATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) COMMERCIAL FARMERS WHOSE PROPERTIES HAVE BEEN </p><p>DESIGNATED RECEIVED LETTERS FROM THEIR RESPECTIVE </p><p>REGIONAL POLICE COMMANDERS ON JANUARY 18 ORDERING THEM </p><p>TO SURRENDER ALL OF THEIR FIREARMS, LICENSED OR NOT, BY </p><p>FEBRUARY 4.  THE LEGAL PROVISION ON WHICH THE GOZ HAS </p><p>BASED THIS MOVE IS APPARENTLY FULL OF HOLES, BUT WE </p><p>UNDERSTAND THE GOZ PLANS TO ISSUE A STATUTORY </p><p>INSTRUMENT (DECREE) LEGALIZING THE SEIZURES.  (NOTE: WE </p><p>HAVE ALSO RECEIVED AN UNCONFIRMED REPORT THAT THE CIO </p><p>HAS CONFISCATED SOME WEAPONS AND LICENSES, WITHOUT </p><p>ISSUING RECEIPTS, IN THE FEATHERSTONE AREA 100 KM SOUTH </p><p>OF HARARE, ALTHOUGH THIS REPORTEDLY IS NOT YET GOZ </p><p>POLICY.  END NOTE.)  IAN COCHRAN, A COMMERCIAL FARMER </p><p>IN KAROI, WHICH HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY BADLY AFFECTED BY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00211  02 OF 02  231639Z </p><p>THE LAND INVASIONS, TOLD POLITICAL SECTION CHIEF HE WAS </p><p>EXTREMELY DISTURBED BY THIS NEW REQUIREMENT, AS HIS </p><p>FIREARMS PROVIDED HIS FAMILY\'S ONLY PROTECTION IN THE </p><p>CHAOTIC ENVIRONMENT PREVAILING IN HIS REGION.  IF </p><p>FORCED TO COMPLY, HE SAID HE AND HIS FAMILY WOULD LEAVE </p><p>THE COUNTRY.  IN THE MEANTIME, COCHRAN AND A NUMBER OF </p><p>OTHER FARMERS ARE ENCOURAGING THE COMMERCIAL FARMERS </p><p>UNION TO CHALLENGE THE POLICE ACTION IN COURT. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
