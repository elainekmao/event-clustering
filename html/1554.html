IRVING FOR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  00882  020725Z </p><p>REASONS: 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) ON MARCH 1, UNSG SPECIAL ENJOY MORJANE DELIVERED </p><p>A SPEECH ON THE DRC TO THE SADC REGIONAL PEACEKEEPING </p><p>TRAINING CENTER (RPTC) IN HARARE.  MORJANE\'S VISIT WAS </p><p>ARRANGED BY UNITAR-GENEVA AND SPONSORED BY THE RPTC. </p><p>THE RPTC\'S MANAGING DIRECTOR, PETER VOETMANN, PROVIDED A </p><p>READOUT TO POLOFF ON MORJANE\'S SPEECH, WHICH WAS </p><p>ATTENDED BY A NUMBER OF ZIMBABWE MILITARY OFFICERS AND </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE ZIMBABWEAN MINISTRIES OF </p><p>DEFENSE AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) ACCORDING TO VOETMANN, MORJANE WAS VERY </p><p>OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE DRC PEACE PROCESS AND PROGRESS </p><p>BEING MADE IN MONUC DEPLOYMENT.  MORJANE OUTLINED </p><p>OBSTACLES TO THE DEPLOYMENT OF PEACEKEEPERS, </p><p>PARTICULARLY POOR INFRASTRUCTURE AND DENSELY FORESTED </p><p>TERRAIN IN THE CONGO.  MORJANE CALLED FOR THE USE OF </p><p>SMALLER, COMPANY-SIZED UNITS OPERATING MORE </p><p>INDEPENDENTLY THAN NORMAL MILITARY UNITS.  AN ARMORED </p><p>INFANTRY BATTALION SIMPLY WOULD NOT BE EFFECTIVE IN THE </p><p>CONGOLESE ENVIRONMENT, THE ENVOY ARGUED.  HE ALSO STATED </p><p>THAT MORE SOPHISTICATED EQUIPMENT, SUCH AS HELICOPTERS, </p><p>WOULD BE NEEDED FOR EFFECTIVE MONITORING. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) MORJANE ALSO FLOATED THE IDEA THAT THE SADC </p><p>ALLIES SHOULD CONSIDER "CHANGING THEIR BERETS TO BLUE" </p><p>IN THE DRC.  HOWEVER, THE CONSENT OF ALL THE LUSAKA </p><p>PARTIES WOULD BE NECESSARY, INCLUDING PEOPLE ON ALL </p><p>LEVELS, FROM THE SOLDIERS ON UP.  THE ENVOY STATED THAT </p><p>MORE ROBUST RULES OF ENGAGEMENT WOULD HAVE TO BE DEVISED </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00882  020725Z </p><p>AS WELL, ACCORDING TO VOETMANN.  VOETMANN COMMENTED THAT </p><p>MORJANE\'S IDEA WOULD REQUIRE A "SUBSTANTIAL" COMMITMENT </p><p>FROM THE UN, HOWEVER. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) COMMENT: MORJANE\'S PROPOSAL TO CONVERT SADC </p><p>TROOPS ALREADY IN THE DRC TO UN PEACEKEEPERS IS AN </p><p>INTERESTING IDEA THAT PROBABLY HAS NOT RECEIVED WIDE </p><p>CONSIDERATION HERE.  AS VOETMANN SAID, HOWEVER, IT WOULD </p><p>REQUIRE A MAJOR FINANCIAL COMMITMENT THAT NEITHER THE UN </p><p>NOR THE BELLIGERENTS MAY BE PREPARED TO MAKE YET.  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
