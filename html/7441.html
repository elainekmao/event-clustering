<p>UNCLAS AMMAN 002260 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>ATHENS FOR TSAR MONTGOMERY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAIR, MOPS, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDAN ISSUES MODIFIED NOTAM </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 86416 </p><p> </p><p> 1.  (SBU) After receiving REFTEL talking points April 8, </p><p>Jordan Civil Aviation Authority Director Hanna Najjar told us </p><p>that he had "no problem" issuing a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM), </p><p>but said he would limit the contents to operational </p><p>instructions, ICAO provisions, frequencies, etc., removing </p><p>allusions to the U.S. and coalition military forces. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Najjar stressed other measures that the CAA was </p><p>already taking, such as denial of entry into Jordanian </p><p>airspace to aircraft without a flight plan and prior notice </p><p>of entry.  He added that the CAA mandates radio and radar </p><p>contact 10 minutes prior to entry into airspace; failure to </p><p>do so insures a military escort. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) The following is the modified NOTAM, issued April </p><p>10, by the CAA, available on the Defense Internet NOTAM </p><p>System (DINS) at www.notams.faa.gov: </p><p> </p><p>Advisory for All Aircraft Entering Jordanian Airspace </p><p> </p><p>This notice is effective immediately and will remain in </p><p>effect until further notice. </p><p> </p><p>A.  All aircraft should be positively identified by radar and </p><p>two way communication before entering Jordanian airspace. </p><p> </p><p>B.  The timely and accurate identification of civil aircraft </p><p>operating within Jordanian airspace is essential to preclude </p><p>the inadvertent use of military force against civil aircraft. </p><p> </p><p>C.  All civil aircraft flying within or entering the </p><p>Jordanian airspace shall continuously monitor one or both </p><p>international emergency frequencies (VHF 121.5 MHz and/or UHF </p><p>243.0 MHz). </p><p> </p><p>D.  When an aircraft carries a serviceable transponder, the </p><p>pilot shall operate the transponder at all times during the </p><p>flight regardless of whether the aircraft is within or </p><p>outside airspace where SSR is used for ATS purposes.  All </p><p>crews are reminded to continuously operate the SSR </p><p>transponder in accordance with the ICAO provisions (PANS-ATM </p><p>- Chapter 8, PANS-OPS, Vol. i, Part viii, and ICAO 7030 </p><p>Chapter 8). </p><p> </p><p>E.  When an aircraft carries serviceable weather radar the </p><p>pilot shall operate it at all times during the flight within </p><p>the Jordanian airspace regardless of weather conditions. </p><p> </p><p>F.  The pilot should ensure continuous display of aircraft </p><p>exterior and cabin lighting and illumination of logo lights, </p><p>if possible. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
