<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 001800 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/24/2013 </p><p>TAGS: AEMR, AMGT, ASEC, CASC, CVIS, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZO1: AMMAN SITREP 11 (3/25 1800 LOCAL) </p><p> </p><p>REF: FBIS GMP20030324000166 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Acting DCM Doug Silliman. Reason 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>General Overview </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) The Embassy continues on a normal schedule March 25, </p><p>with Consular services open.  The Peace Corps office opened </p><p>briefly to allow access to Jordanian staff, but activity at </p><p>the American Language Center remains suspended. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Jordan </p><p>confirmed that the Bank had ordered commercial banks to </p><p>freeze Iraqi government assets in Jordanian banks.  Other </p><p>Iraqi deposits are being closely monitored by the CBJ.  The </p><p>CBJ is in daily contact with banks on this issue. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The local owner of the Pizza Hut and Popeye\'s </p><p>restaurant franchises informed the Embassy of an anonymous </p><p>text message circulating on cell phones calling for a march </p><p>to American restaurants today, March 25, in order to "break </p><p>them."  The message specifically mentioned McDonald\'s, Burger </p><p>King, Pizza Hut, Popeye\'s and Kentucky Fried Chicken.  The </p><p>owner further stated that he contacted the police, who would </p><p>provide extra security.  Embassy RSO confirmed that PSD was </p><p>notified and requested to provide additional resources at the </p><p>named franchises.  The local owner added that although </p><p>business had been down 55% over the last week, he had heard </p><p>no directs calls for a boycott but feared it would not be </p><p>long in the coming. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Royal Jordanian is operating to all destinations </p><p>except Baghdad.  On March 25, CEO Samer Majali expressed an </p><p>interest in "helping the US" get Iraqi Airways flying </p><p>quickly.  He said RJ is ready to operate flights on behalf of </p><p>Iraqi airways out of Baghdad, even repainting planes if </p><p>necessary.  He stressed RJ\'s long familiarity with Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  With the international airport and seaport and the </p><p>border crossings to Israel remaining open, there has been no </p><p>interruption of imports or exports.  Insurance companies have </p><p>not designated Jordanian air or seaports as high risk/war </p><p>risk areas, although some exporters say shipping rates have </p><p>increased due to higher fuel costs.  QIZ companies report no </p><p>problems.  They are continuing to meet deadlines and fill </p><p>orders that were booked before hostilities began.  Target </p><p>Corporation told us they recently booked new orders with </p><p>Jordanian factories, and a QIZ company reported that investor </p><p>interest continues. </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) A FBIS report cited a previously-unknown internet </p><p>source as saying that two relatives of Saddam Hussein had </p><p>defected to Amman, including Hisham Hasan al-Majid, brother </p><p>of "Chemical Ali" al-Majid, and the son of the Iraqi </p><p>president\'s sister Siham.  The source also states that it is </p><p>believed that "Chemical Ali", Uday Hussein, and Izzat Ibrahim </p><p>al-Duri were killed in the raid by US bombers on Thursday </p><p>morning.  There are media reports of "hundreds" of Iraqis </p><p>returning to Iraq via the Jordanian border in order to "fight </p><p>for Iraq\'s honor." </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) The Amman Stock Exchange index, which had increased </p><p>1.25% and 0.96% during the first two trading following the </p><p>start of hostilities, declined by 0.75% on Monday and by </p><p>0.25% Tuesday.  Traders attributed this more to Monday\'s </p><p>global stock market drop than to increased domestic jitters. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>Consular Issues </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) No new issues.  Inquiries remain below normal, but </p><p>could be due to inclement weather in addition to the </p><p>political situation. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>GOJ Actions/Statements </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Nothing new to report. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>Security </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (U)  A demonstration and march organized by opposition </p><p>parties was scheduled for this afternoon in a commercial area </p><p>of western Amman, evidently approved by PSD.  Demonstrations </p><p>also continue at some universities but have been confined to </p><p>the campuses and have not involved any violence.  Current </p><p>snowstorms will likely limit the participation in these </p><p>demonstrations. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>Refugee/Humanitarian Issues </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>11. (C) The Jordan-Iraq border remains open and the flow of </p><p>TCNs remains at a trickle.  There is still no sign of any </p><p>Iraqi refugees/asylum seekers.  46 TCNs crossed into Jordan </p><p>over the last 24 hours, bringing the total population of the </p><p>transit camp to 169 -- Somalis, Sudanese, Malians, Eritreans </p><p>and 1 Djibouti national.  IOM repatriated seven Egyptians </p><p>this morning via the Aqaba ferry.  UNHCR Sr. Logistics </p><p>Officer reports that the Jordan Red Crescent is doing a very </p><p>poor job of managing the transit camp, noting that their food </p><p>supplier provided food for the first time yesterday, March </p><p>24, and that most likely the JRCS would be unable to handle </p><p>more than the trickle of TCNs currently entering the camp. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C)  On March 24, GOJ Minister of Interior Majali </p><p>personally reviewed the cases of 23 people with document </p><p>problems being held at the border.  UNHCR reported that the </p><p>one Iraqi national who was trying to transit Jordan en route </p><p>to Yemen was "persuaded" to return to Iraq.  UNHCR did not </p><p>believe the return was involuntary.  22 Palestinians will be </p><p>reviewed by UNRWA officials today.  If they are found to have </p><p>UNRWA status, they will be admitted to the transit camp until </p><p>a more permanent accommodation is identified for them.  UNHCR </p><p>also reports that a handful of vehicles is entering Iraq from </p><p>Jordan this morning, including a family of Iraqis laden down </p><p>with household possessions who said they\'re returning home to </p><p>Baghdad. </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>Press </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) Despite repeated PA denials, Embassy Information </p><p>Officer continues to receive inquiries from local journalists </p><p>asking about rumors that the daughter of VP Cheney is en </p><p>route to Baghdad to act as a "human shield." The Foreign </p><p>Minister and the Israeli press officer called the Embassy to </p><p>confirm that this story is untrue. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
