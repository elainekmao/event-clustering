EPSTEIN-K. METRES EMAIL </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: POLMINCOUNS T. COUNTRYMAN FOR REASONS 1.5 </p><p>(B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.    (C) SUMMARY.  AFRICA DG CABRAS REQUESTED A MEETING WITH </p><p>POLMINCOUNS TO GET U.S. VIEWS ON THE CRISIS IN NIGERIA AND </p><p>REVIEW OTHER TIMELY ISSUES.  SOME ITALIAN NGOS ARE CONCERNED </p><p>ABOUT THE APPLICATION OF THE DEATH PENALTY IN NIGERIA, BUT </p><p>CABRAS AGREED THAT THE GOI\'S FOREIGN POLICY PRIORITY MUST BE </p><p>FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS.  ON ZIMBABWE, CABRAS MENTIONED THAT </p><p>AN UPCOMING EU MEETING WOULD DISCUSS HOW TO HANDLE THE </p><p>QUESTION OF WHETHER TO INVITE MUGABE TO NEXT YEAR\'S EU-AU </p><p>MINISTERIAL.  THE EU MEETING WOULD ALSO DISCUSS COTE </p><p>D\'IVOIRE, AND THE GOI WOULD PUSH FOR GREATER EU INVOLVEMENT </p><p>IN PEACE NEGOTIATIONS. POLMINCOUNS RAISED THE FOOD CRISIS IN </p><p>SOUTHERN AND EASTERN AFRICA, AND CABRAS SPOKE BRIEFLY ABOUT </p><p>TERRORISM IN KENYA.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>NIGERIA:  DEATH PENALTY, ELECTIONS </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.    (C) ON DECEMBER 2, POLMINCOUNS MET WITH BRUNO CABRAS, </p><p>THE MFA DIRECTOR GENERAL FOR AFRICAN AFFAIRS.  CABRAS </p><p>REQUESTED THE MEETING IN ORDER TO PREPARE THE FONMIN FOR AN </p><p>UPCOMING MEETING WITH NESSUNO TOCCHI CAINO (LET NOBODY TOUCH </p><p>CAIN), A LOCAL ANTI-DEATH PENALTY NGO.  NOTE:  THE DEATH </p><p>SENTENCES AGAINST TWO UNWED NIGERIAN MOTHERS ATTRACTED </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  05832  01 OF 02  050113Z </p><p>WIDESPREAD CONCERN IN ITALY, PUTTING NIGERIA ON THE MFA\'S </p><p>RADAR SCREEN.  END NOTE.  POLMINCOUNS DREW FROM REF A POINTS </p><p>ON ELECTION ASSISTANCE, TO WHICH CABRAS REPLIED, "OUR </p><p>POSITIONS COINCIDE ALMOST PERFECTLY."  THE GOI\'S FIRST </p><p>PRIORITY WAS SUPPORTING THE ELECTION PROCESS; ITALY HAS </p><p>PROVIDED ITALIAN OBSERVERS AND TECHNICAL AID OVER AND ABOVE </p><p>THE EU PROGRAM.  CABRAS OPINED THAT THE REAL CAUSES OF THE </p><p>STRIFE WERE POLITICAL STRUGGLE AND ECONOMIC DEGRADATION, NOT </p><p>ETHNIC AND RELIGIOUS DIFFERENCES PER SE. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>EU-AU:  THE ZIMBABWE QUESTION, ROUND II </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.    (C) IN A DECEMBER 4 MEETING IN BRUSSELS, EU AFRICA </p><p>HANDS WILL DISCUSS HOW TO HANDLE THE EU-AU MINISTERIAL </p><p>PLANNED FOR LISBON IN 2003, IN LIGHT OF THE FAILURE OF THE </p><p>EU-SADC MAPUTU "SOLUTION" TO THE DILEMMA OF ACCORDING MUGABE </p><p>THE HONOR OF AN INVITATION TO EUROPE.  CABRAS ASSERTED THAT </p><p>SINCE THE PURPOSE OF THE MEETING WAS DIALOGUE, NO COUNTRY </p><p>COULD BE EXCLUDED.  HE BELIEVED THAT POSTPONEMENT WOULD "SEND </p><p>A VERY BAD MESSAGE" AND THAT THE AU STATES WOULD NOT COME IF </p><p>MUGABE WERE NOT INVITED.  POLMINCOUNS SAID THAT THE SUMMIT IS </p><p>MUCH MORE IMPORTANT TO THE AU THAN IT IS TO THE EUROPEAN </p><p>LEADERS.  THE EU SHOULD NOT BE SO HESITANT TO USE THAT </p><p>LEVERAGE TO FIND A WAY TO EXCLUDE MUGABE. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p>COTE D\'IVOIRE:  COULD THE EU HELP THE DISMAL SITUATION? </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  05832  01 OF 02  050113Z </p><p>4.    (C) TURNING TO COTE D\'IVOIRE, CABRAS SAID THE GOI\'S </p><p>FIRST PRIORITY WAS THE SUCCESS OF THE ECOWAS NEGOTIATIONS, </p><p>WHICH HE NOTED, "ARE NOT GOING WELL."  THE ROLE OF PRESIDENT </p><p>WADE OF SENEGAL, WHO "WANTED TO BE CENTER STAGE" IN SPITE OF </p><p>OTHER COUNTRIES\' DISSENSION, WAS PROBLEMATIC, AND THE REBELS </p><p>HAD CALLED INTO QUESTION THE ENTIRE CONSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURE </p><p>OF CDI.  IF THE GCI COULD NOT RECAPTURE MAN, THERE WOULD BE </p><p>NO MILITARY OPTION FOR THE GCI UNLESS FRANCE BACKED IT. </p><p>THERE WAS ALSO THE POSSIBILITY THAT GCI FORCES COULD TURN </p><p>AGAINST PRESIDENT GBAGBO, LEADING TO CDI\'S PARTITION AND </p><p>"ECONOMIC DISASTER FOR THE COUNTRY AND THE REGION." </p><p> </p><p>5.    (C) AT THE BRUSSELS MEETING, WHICH THE GOI WOULD CHAIR, </p><p>A DISCUSSION OF WHETHER DIRECT ENGAGEMENT BY THE EU IN CDI </p><p>COULD HELP WOULD BE "VERY, VERY HIGH ON THE AGENDA."  THE </p><p>GOI, WHICH FAVORS ENGAGEMENT BY THE EU, MIGHT PROPOSE SENDING </p><p>A SPECIAL ENVOY TO "ORIENT THE NEGOTIATION" BETWEEN THE </p><p>PARTIES.  CABRAS WASN\'T SURE THAT FRANCE WOULD BE </p><p>ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT AN EU ROLE BUT PREDICTED THAT IN A FEW </p><p>WEEKS OR MONTHS, THE GOF WOULD WELCOME THIS SHARING OF THE </p><p>BURDEN. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>FOOD CRISIS:  MFA WITH US ON GMO ISSUE </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ7541 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  05832  02 OF 02  050114Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AF-00    AID-00   CIAE-00  DODE-00  SRPP-00  EB-00 </p><p>      VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    L-00     VCE-00 </p><p>      AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   PA-00    PM-00 </p><p>      PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    SS-00    STR-00   TRSE-00 </p><p>      T-00     USIE-00  PMB-00   PRM-00   DRL-02   G-00     SAS-00 </p><p>        /007W </p><p>                  ------------------12D607  050114Z /21 </p><p>R 040510Z DEC 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 7184 </p><p>INFO EU MEMBER STATES COLLECTIVE </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY ABIDJAN </p><p>AMEMBASSY ABUJA </p><p>AMEMBASSY ACCRA </p><p>AMEMBASSY BAMAKO </p><p>AMEMBASSY CONAKRY </p><p>AMEMBASSY MONROVIA </p><p>AMEMBASSY OUAGADOUGOU </p><p>AMCONSUL LAGOS </p><p>USEU BRUSSELS 2989 </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 ROME 005832 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/03/2007 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PHUM, CI, ZI, NI, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA, ZIMBABWE, COTE D\'IVOIRE:  ITALY, EU </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  05832  02 OF 02  050114Z </p><p>CONSIDER APPROPRIATE ROLE </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.

ASKED ABOUT KENYA, </p><p>POLMINCOUNS MENTIONED THAT WE HAD RELEASED A TRAVEL ADVISORY </p><p>ALSO COVERING DJIBOUTI AND YEMEN.  CABRAS AGREED THAT SUCH </p><p>ACTION WAS NECESSARY BUT REGRETTED THE IMPACT OF SUCH </p><p>WARNINGS ON THE ECONOMIES OF THE COUNTRIES NAMED. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME05832 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
