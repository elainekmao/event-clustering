<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ROME 001168 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT. FOR IO, IO/SHA. DRL, DRL/MLA, SA/PAB AND EUR/WE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/19/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, IT, UNHRC-1, AFGHANISTAN, HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>SUBJECT: CHR-59: ITALIANS SUPPORT VIRTUALLY ALL U.S. </p><p>OBJECTIVES, PROPOSE AFGHANISTAN LANGUAGE </p><p> </p><p>REF: A.

(U) ITALY LARGELY SUPPORTS U.S. OBJECTIVES AND PLANS FOR </p><p>SPECIFIC COUNTRY RESOLUTIONS AT CHR-59, MFA HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>OFFICE DIRECTOR CALVETTA TOLD US MARCH 19.  RESPONDING TO OUR </p><p>MARCH 13 DEMARCHE (CALVETTA WAS UNAVAILABLE PRIOR TO THE </p><p>19TH), CALVETTA SAID THE MFA WAS PLEASED WITH THE EXPANDED </p><p>U.S.-EU HUMAN RIGHTS CONSULTATIONS.  HE AND HIS COLLEAGUES </p><p>HOPED WE COULD CONTINUE THEM DURING ITALY,S EU PRESIDENCY IN </p><p>THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR TO IMPROVE COORDINATION ON HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS ISSUES AT THE 2003 UNGA. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) CALVETTA INDICATED ITALY AND ITS FELLOW MEMBER-STATES </p><p>GENERALLY SHARED OUR VIEWS ON THE SPECIFIC COUNTRY </p><p>RESOLUTIONS (ITALIAN VIEWS ON SPECIAL UNGA/CHR SESSIONS </p><p>DETAILED IN REF A); IT STRONGLY SUPPORTED RESOLUTIONS INTER </p><p>ALIA ON CUBA, DPRK, BELARUS, TURKMENISTAN AND ZIMBABWE.  IRAN </p><p>REMAINED THE EXCEPTION; THE GAERC HAD DECIDED MARCH 18 NOT TO </p><p>PURSUE/RUN AN IRAN RESOLUTION.  CALVETTA REHEARSED FAMILIAR </p><p>ARGUMENTS THAT THE LURE OF A TCA AGREEMENT WITH THE EU COULD </p><p>STILL ENCOURAGE IMPROVED IRANIAN PERFORMANCE ON HUMAN RIGHTS, </p><p>STARTING WITH ADHERENCE TO THE EU BENCHMARKS.   IRAN,S </p><p>COMPLICATED POLITICAL SCENE, WITH AYATOLLAHS (SIC) REVIEWING </p><p>DRAFT PARLIAMENTARY LEGISLATION, MEANT SIGNIFICANT CHANGE </p><p>WOULD BE A SLOW PROCESS.  CONSEQUENTLY, THE EU JUDGED IT </p><p>NECESSARY TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL TIME ) PERHAPS A YEAR ) TO </p><p>EVALUATE IRAN,S ACTUAL COMMITMENT TO THE BENCHMARKS.   WE </p><p>NOTED THE STEADY DETERIORATION IN IRAN,S HUMAN RIGHTS RECORD </p><p>AND CLIMATE, EVEN WITH THE PROSPECT OF THE TCA, AS CLEAR </p><p>EVIDENCE THAT INCENTIVES ALONE WERE INSUFFICIENT.  CALVETTA </p><p>    SAID THE MFA HOPED THAT, IN THE WAKE OF THE GAERC\'S DECISION, </p><p>THE U.S. WOULD NOT FORCE THE ISSUE BY PROPOSING A RESOLUTION </p><p>ON IRAN THAT WAS CERTAIN TO BE DEFEATED. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) CALVETTA CONFIRMED THAT ITALY WAS DRAFTING LANGUAGE ON </p><p>AFGHANISTAN, TO BE PRESENTED AS AN ITEM NINE RESOLUTION.  HE </p><p>PROMISED TO SHARE THE DRAFT LANGUAGE ONCE IT WAS FINE-TUNED </p><p>(AND DID SO AM MARCH 20; WE ARE E-MAILING THE TEXT TO IO, </p><p>DRL, SA AND GENEVA).   ON CHINA, CALVETTA INDICATED THE EU </p><p>HAD AGREED TO SUPPORT A CHINA RESOLUTION IF THE U.S. DECIDED </p><p>TO PRESENT ONE. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) TURNING TO THEMATIC ISSUES, CALVETTA NOTED THAT </p><p>RECENT U.S.-EU CONSULTATIONS HAD FAILED TO SETTLE ON </p><p>MUTUALLY-ACCEPTABLE LANGUAGE ON SUCH DIVISIVE ISSUES AS THE </p><p>DEATH PENALTY, CHILD-SOLDIERS AND THE ICC.  AFTER A FEW </p><p>MINUTES, JOUSTING OVER OUR RESPECTIVE POSITIONS, CALVETTA </p><p>ASKED THAT THE U.S. MAKE GREATER USE OF STATEMENTS AND </p><p>EXPLANATION-OF-VOTES, RATHER THAN FORMAL CALLS FOR VOTES, TO </p><p>OBJECT TO EU LANGUAGE ON THESE TOPICS.  SUCH A TACTIC WOULD </p><p>IMPROVE THE COHESION BOTH THE U.S. AND EU WERE TRYING TO </p><p>CULTIVATE FOR THIS YEAR,S CHR SESSION.  WE PUSHED BACK ALONG </p><p>LINES OF REF C, NOTING THAT IT WOULD BE MUCH EASIER FOR US TO </p><p>DO SO IF THEMATIC LANGUAGE WAS NOT SCATTERED LIBERALLY </p><p>THROUGHOUT A SUCCESSION OF RESOLUTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) CALVETTA REAFFIRMED THAT ITALY WOULD BE MOUNTING A </p><p>STRONG EFFORT FOR A SEAT ON CHR-60, REMINDING US THAT ITALY </p><p>HAD STEPPED ASIDE THIS YEAR TO FACILITATE THE U.S. RETURN TO </p><p>THE COMMISSION.  WE REASSURED CALVETTA THAT WASHINGTON HAD </p><p>NOT FORGOTTEN ITALY,S GESTURE AND OBSERVED THAT CHR-60 </p><p>    ELECTIONS WERE STILL TWO MONTHS OFF, WITHOUT OFFERING ANY </p><p>SUBSTANTIVE COMMENT ON THE LIKELIHOOD OF U.S. SUPPORT FOR </p><p>ITALY,S CANDIDACY.  (COMMENT:  WE EXPECT MORE FREQUENT </p><p>REMINDERS ) AT HIGHER LEVELS ) OF ITALY,S GESTURE AS THE </p><p>CHR-60 ELECTIONS NEAR.) </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p> 2003ROME01168 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
