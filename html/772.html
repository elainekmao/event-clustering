CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  LEADER OF THE SUDANESE OPPOSITION </p><p>COALITION, AL-SAYED EL-MERGHANI, TOLD US SEPTEMBER 15 </p><p>THAT OPPOSITION EFFORTS WILL PRODUCE THE DOWNFALL OF THE </p><p>NATIONAL ISLAMIC FRONT (NIF) REGIME IN KHARTOUM. </p><p> </p><p>--  TO FURTHER THIS EFFORT, EL-MERGHANI ASKED THE USG TO </p><p>"ENCOURAGE" REGIONAL LEADERS TO LEND SUPPORT TO SUDANESE </p><p>OPPOSITION GROUPS.  WE RESPONDED THAT THE U.S. WOULD NOT </p><p>INTERFERE WITH INTERNAL MATTERS IN SUDAN, BUT AGREED TO </p><p>PASS ON HIS REQUEST.  PLEASE NOTE ACTION REQUEST, </p><p>PARAGRAPH 11. </p><p> </p><p>--  REGARDING TERRORIST ACTIVITY, EL-MERGHANI SAID HE IS </p><p>SURE THE NOTORIOUS BIN LADEN REMAINS IN SUDAN.  HE </p><p>ACCUSED THE GOS OF COMPLICITY IN THE ASSASSINATION </p><p>ATTEMPT ON PRESIDENT MUBARAK. </p><p> </p><p>--  EL-MERGHANI NOTED EVIDENCE OF SUPPORT FROM BOTH IRAN </p><p>AND IRAQ FOR THE NIF, CITING NIF LEADER TURABI\'S </p><p>PARTICULARLY CLOSE ASSOCIATION WITH SADDAM HUSSEIN.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  AFRICA WATCHER MET IN LONDON ON SEPTEMBER 15 WITH </p><p>LEADER OF THE SUDANESE DEMOCRATIC UNIONIST PARTY (DUP) </p><p>AND HEAD OF THE COUNTRY\'S OPPOSITION COALITION, AL-SAYED </p><p>MOHAMED OSMAN EL-MERGHANI.  ALTHOUGH EL-MERGHANI SPEAKS </p><p>SOME ENGLISH, HE USUALLY SPOKE IN ARABIC, WHICH HIS </p><p>AIDE, A. HADI (A SECURITY CONSULTANT BASED IN THE </p><p>BRITISH MIDLANDS), TRANSLATED.  MERGHANI WORE CEREMONIAL </p><p>BLACK ROBES AND A TURBAN. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>OPPOSITION GOALS </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  EL-MERGHANI NOTED THAT THE DUP HAD JUST COMPLETED </p><p>THE LONDON MEETING OF ITS EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE THAT DAY. </p><p>THE PARTY HAD RESOLVED THAT, IN THE ABSENCE OF SUPPORT </p><p>FROM THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, THE DUP WILL BEGIN TO </p><p>LOBBY SUDANESE IN EXILE FOR SUPPORT.  IN PARTICULAR, </p><p>EL-MERGHANI SAID, THE OPPOSITION IS SEEKING TO ESTABLISH </p><p>A RADIO STATION.  AT THE SAME TIME, OPPOSITIONISTS WILL </p><p>SEEK SUPPORT FROM DISGRUNTLED MEMBERS OF THE SUDANESE </p><p>MILITARY.  IN ADDITION TO GENERAL FATIH AHMED ALI, SOME </p><p>COMMANDERS IN BORDER AREAS ARE SYMPATHETIC TO THE </p><p>OPPOSITION. </p><p> </p><p>5.  ASKED FOR HIS PROGNOSIS, EL-MERGHANI SAID HE </p><p>BELIEVED SUDAN WILL AVOID SOMALIA\'S FATE, AND THAT THE </p><p>SUDANESE PEOPLE WILL "TOPPLE" THE NIF REGIME.  BUT THE </p><p>GOS WILL NEVER FALL ON ITS OWN.  THE CURRENT SPATE OF </p><p>DEMONSTRATIONS ARE THE FIRST HINT OF THAT KIND OF </p><p>EFFORT.  YET FOREIGN AFFAIRS SECRETARY EL-SADDIN HAS </p><p>SAID THAT IF THE GOS FALLS, HE WILL MAKE THE COUNTRY </p><p>UNGOVERNABLE, EL-MERGHANI TOLD US.  AND IF THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT FALLS AND THE OPPOSITION COMES TO POWER, </p><p>EL-MERGHANI BELIEVES SIXTH-COLUMNISTS FROM THE NIF WILL </p><p>POSE A SERIOUS DANGER TO ITS STABILITY, ALONG WITH </p><p>TERRORISTS WHOM THE NIF REGIME HAS SUPPORTED. </p><p> </p><p></p><p>REQUEST FOR USG SUPPORT </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  EL-MERGHANI SAID THE SUDANESE OPPOSITION DID NOT </p><p>WANT INTERVENTION FROM THE U.S. OR NEIGHBORING STATES, </p><p>BUT HOPED FOR SUPPORT.  IN PARTICULAR, HE ASKED THE U.S. </p><p>TO "ENCOURAGE" NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES -- HE MENTIONED </p><p>EGYPT, SAUDI ARABIA AND THE GULF STATES IN PARTICULAR -- </p><p>TO LEND SUPPORT TO THE OPPOSITION.  FOR IF THE </p><p>PPOSITION DOES NOT SUCCEED IN OVERTHROWING THE NIF </p><p>REGIME, EL-MERGHANI ARGUED, THE AREA WILL REMAIN </p><p>UNSTABLE.  IN RESPONSE, WE SAID THE U.S. WILL NOT </p><p>INTERVENE IN, NOR INTERFERE WITH THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS </p><p>OF, SUDAN.  WE WOULD CONTINUE TO PRESS FOR GREATER </p><p>RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS, AND TO SEEK A REGIONAL </p><p>SOLUTION TO INSTABILITY IN THE REGION.  THAT SAID, WE </p><p>AGREED TO CONVEY EL-MERGHANI\'S REQUEST BACK TO </p><p>WASHINGTON. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GOS SUPPORT FOR TERRORISM </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  ASKED ABOUT KHARTOUM\'S SUPPORT FOR TERRORISM, </p><p>EL-MERGHANI REPLIED THAT THE LOWEST LEVEL OF GOS SUPPORT </p><p>FOR TERRORISM IS ITS OPERATION OF VARIOUS ISLAMIC </p><p>"SALVATION GROUPS."  MANY OF THE MID-LEVEL MANAGERS OF </p><p>THESE GROUPS ARE EITHER SAUDI ARABIAN OR LIBYAN, THOUGH </p><p>MOST OF THE FIELD WORKERS ARE ACTUALLY PALESTINIAN. IN </p><p>ADDITION, MANY APPARENTLY PRIVATE FIRMS IN SUDAN ARE </p><p>ACTUALLY FUND-RAISING FRONTS FOR TERRORISTS, MOSTLY USED </p><p>FOR ACQUIRING WEAPONS, HE ADDED.  THE NOTORIOUS OSAMA </p><p>BIN LADIN REMAINS IN KHARTOUM, EL-MERGHANI MAINTAINED. </p><p>HE NOTED THAT A REPRESENTATIVE OF AN IRANIAN-FUNDED </p><p>ISLAMIC FRONT GROUP, A SAUDI CITIZEN NAMED (FNU) </p><p>MASSARI, IS CURRENTLY IN THE UK UNDER BIN LADIN\'S </p><p>DIRECTION; HE SAID HE HAD TOLD HMG OF THIS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>RELATIONS WITH EGYPT, IGADD </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  ASKED ABOUT THE MUBARAK ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT, </p><p>EL-MERGHANI ACCUSED THE GOS OF INVOLVEMENT IN IT, ADDING </p><p>HE BELIEVED IT WOULD CAUSE A SHAKE UP IN EGYPTIAN </p><p>SECURITY.  IN HIS VIEW, MANY ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALISTS HAD </p><p>INFILTRATED THE EGYPTIAN GOVERNMENT, INCLUDING ITS </p><p>SECURITY APPARATUS.  HE BLAMED LACK OF SAUDI SUPPORT ON </p><p>SIMILAR INFILTRATION BY ISLAMISTS.  HADI, EL-MERGHANI\'S </p><p>ASSISTANT, LATER ADDED THAT THE EGYPTIAN FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER\'S SUDANESE DESK RECENTLY UNDERWENT A PERSONNEL </p><p>UPHEAVAL AS A RESULT OF GOE SECURITY MEASURES, RESULTING </p><p>IN IMPROVED COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN CAIRO AND THE </p><p>SUDANESE OPPOSITION.  EL-MERGHANI ALSO APPLAUDED EGYPT\'S </p><p>REDUCTION OF DIPLOMATIC PRESENCE IN SUDAN.  ASKED ABOUT </p><p>PROSPECTS FOR IGADD BROKERING A REGIONAL SETTLEMENT, </p><p>EL-MERGHANI CALLED THE NIF REGIME "EVIL" AND INCAPABLE </p><p>OF AGREEING TO PEACE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>TURABI AND ISLAMISM </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  AT THE CENTER OF THE NIF REGIME IS TURABI, </p><p>EL-MERGHANI CONTINUED, WHO HAS CLOSE TIES TO IRAN AND </p><p>IRAQ.  THE NIF RECEIVES MANY DONATIONS FROM IRANIAN </p><p>FRONT ORGANIZATIONS, PARTICULARLY THE WRETCHED OF THE </p><p>EARTH, MANY OF WHICH EARN LARGE AMOUNTS OF MONEY THROUGH </p><p>THEIR OPERATION OF HOTELS IN TEHRAN.  THESE </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS HAVE RECENTLY BEGUN TO ANNOUNCE "A GREAT </p><p>LEAP," WHICH EL-MERGHANI BELIEVES MUST REFER TO PLANNED </p><p>ATTACKS ON FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS AND THEIR OFFICIALS. </p><p> </p><p>10.  TURABI HAS LONG HAD A CLOSE ASSOCIATION WITH SADDAM </p><p>HUSSEIN, EL-MERGHANI SAID.  TURABI URGED SADDAM TO </p><p>INVADE KUWAIT, AND ADVISED SADDAM TO INVOKE THE KORAN </p><p>DURING THE GULF WAR AND AFTER.  MORE RECENTLY, </p><p>EL-MERGHANI SAID HE HAD HEARD FROM "EYE-WITNESSES" THAT </p><p>TURABI HAS SAID THAT MUBARAK AND SAUDI ARABIAN KING FAHD </p><p>"MUST GO."  TURABI HAS ALSO DEVELOPED CLOSE CONTACT WITH </p><p>ISLAMISTS IN QATAR.  EL-MERGHANI SAID HE BELIEVES TURABI </p><p>PLANNED A SERIES OF ISLAMIST COUPS THROUGHOUT THE GULF </p><p>REGION, THAT WOULD EVENTUALLY BRING HIM ENORMOUS POWER </p><p>BEHIND THE SCENES.  FOR THIS REASON, EL-MERGHANI </p><p>CONCLUDED, HE BELIEVES THAT TURABI HAS BECOME </p><p>MEGALOMANIACAL.  IN CLOSING, HE ASKED TO MEET AMBASSADOR </p><p>CARNEY EITHER IN LONDON OR CAIRO AT SOME MUTUALLY </p><p>AGREEABLE TIME, AND TO RECOMMEND A CONTACT AT EMBASSY </p><p>CAIRO. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT AND ACTION REQUEST </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  EL-MERGHANI IS A SERIOUS INTERLOCUTOR, THOUGH IT </p><p>MAY BE DIFFICULT TO SUBSTANTIATE ALL HIS VIEWS.  WE </p><p>BELIEVE WE SHOULD REPLY TO HIS REQUEST FOR USG </p><p>ENCOURAGEMENT OF NEIGHBORING STATES IN HIS CAUSE\'S </p><p>BEHALF.  WHILE WE BELIEVE THE USG CANNOT OFFER SUCH </p><p>ENCOURAGEMENT, WE COULD OFFER TO KEEP IN CLOSE TOUCH </p><p>INSTEAD, PROBABLY IN CAIRO (WHERE HE SPENDS MOST OF THE </p><p>YEAR).  ACTION REQUEST:  PLEASE PROVIDE GUIDANCE TO </p><p>REPLY TO EL-MERGHANI\'S REQUEST.  NOTE:  EL-MERGHANI WILL </p><p>REMAIN IN LONDON UNTIL LATE SEPTEMBER; AFRICA WATCHER </p><p>CAN CONVEY USG RESPONSE VIA EL-MERGHANI\'S AIDE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEAL </p><p></p></div>
