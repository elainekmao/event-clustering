<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 002744 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/W EPSTEIN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958;  DECL: </p><p>TAGS: ECON, ELAB, PGOV, EFIN, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: IS NEXT JANUARY\'S 12.5% WAGE </p><p>INCREASE FOR REAL? STAY TUNED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY DCM ANDREWS.  REASON 1.5 (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) During his opening address before his National </p><p>Executive Committee on September 12, National Labour </p><p>Congress (NLC) President Adams Oshiomhole announced he </p><p>had won from the Obasanjo administration a 12.5 per </p><p>cent across-the-board wage increase.  The increase </p><p>would be enacted January 1, 2003. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) To ensure that the agreement was duly </p><p>implemented, Oshiomhole said Labor would set up a </p><p>joint implementation committee with the GON.   The </p><p>remaining half of this long-delayed 25 per cent wage </p><p>that the Obasanjo administration first had promised </p><p>for May 1, 2001, would be implemented a year later -- </p><p>January 1, 2004. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) The new GON-NLC wage hike pact is different </p><p>from its two predecessors in that neither the </p><p>presidency nor the Ministry of Information announced </p><p>it.  Neither, however, did they disavow it.  By </p><p>withholding official announcement, the GON may be </p><p>attempting to deflect criticism from the IMF and </p><p>international community for such a step that would </p><p>place even more pressure on an already burdened </p><p>budget.  In fact, the day Oshiohmole\'s announcement </p><p>appeared in the press, Chief Economic Advisor Magnus </p><p>Kpakol claimed ignorance about the wage increase at a </p><p>reception hosted by the IMF Country Director. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Optimists in the GON may believe that by the </p><p>beginning of the year, the budgetary consequences of a </p><p>wage increase will be mitigated by the assumed upsurge </p><p>in oil revenues due to higher than budgeted oil prices </p><p>coming into the system in late 2002 and early 2003. </p><p>(GON oil revenues were down the first half of 2002 </p><p>because of a roughly 20% lower quota -- 2.2 million </p><p>bpd was cut to 1.78 million bpd -- and lower prices </p><p>for Nigerian oil in late 2001 which reflected the post </p><p>9/11 drops in the oil futures markets of last fall.) </p><p>However, the average per barrel price for the final </p><p>two quarters of 2002 and first quarter of 2003 will be </p><p>40 per cent or more above the budgeted USD $18 per </p><p>barrel thus notably increasing revenues.  Some </p><p>politicians also argue that the wage hike can be paid </p><p>from the 11 percent devaluation the Naira underwent </p><p>since June, claiming each dollar now generates about </p><p>13 extra Naira, more than enough to cover the </p><p>increased cost.  Note: These arguments ignore </p><p>increased inflation and further devaluation of the </p><p>Naira, two likely and probably immediate results </p><p>(thanks to the Dutch Auction System) of further </p><p>deficit spending resulting from the 12.5 per cent wage </p><p>hike.  End note. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) GON Economic policy officials, including </p><p>Central Bank of Nigeria Research Director Joseph </p><p>Nnanna and Director General of the Debt Management </p><p>Office Akin Arikawe are pessimistic about revenues but </p><p>optimistic that Obasanjo will again postpone the wage </p><p>increase.  They say he will not raise wages in January </p><p>unless there is a radical improvement in the GON </p><p>fiscal situation and cite the lack of revenues as the </p><p>rationale for shelving the earlier wage increase.  The </p><p>new deal, they insist, also has a low-revenue escape </p><p>clause. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Comment: A deal to raise wages enhances </p><p>Obasanjo\'s position with organized labor (the largest </p><p>single component of organized civil society claiming </p><p>more than 5 million members) at a time when Obasanjo </p><p>is eager for support given the ongoing impeachment </p><p>threat against him.  Moreover, the news of a wage </p><p>increase may have pre-empted calls for labor action </p><p>against the Administration.  Confrontation with labor </p><p>would have only added to Obasanjo\'s current political </p><p>weakness.  In any case, Oshiohmole has previously been </p><p>supportive of Obasanjo despite the President\'s having </p><p>reneged on the promised 25 per cent increase last </p><p>year.  The current wage agreement may be seen as a </p><p>gesture of goodwill toward Oshiohmole and labor.  If </p><p>the GON institutes the increase, it will be one of </p><p>those instances where the positive immediate political </p><p>benefits outweigh the probable negative future </p><p>economic impact.  Obasanjo\'s final decision will </p><p>probably depend less on economic data and more on his </p><p>political standing come January 1, 2003. End comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
