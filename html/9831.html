Summary:  On 25 July 2003, Department and Embassy Rome </p><p>officers met with Italian Department of Fisheries Deputy </p><p>Director Plinio Conte to discuss Italy\'s implementation of </p><p>the 1999 US-Italy driftnet agreement.  It appears that Italy </p><p>has made significant progress towards ending the use of </p><p>large-scale, high seas driftnets.  Embassy Rome will forward </p><p>documents provided during the meeting to the Department. </p><p>End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  On July 25, as requested by ref A, EST section arranged </p><p>a meeting for OES/OMC officer Stetson Tinkham with </p><p>appropriate Italian fisheries officials.  Tinkham opened the </p><p>meeting with a brief statement of USG concerns that a lack </p><p>of reporting by Italy on how it was fulfilling the terms of </p><p>our 1999 bilateral agreement might cause the driftnet issue </p><p>to become an irritant in our bilateral relationship once </p><p>again. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Italian officials (list in para 6 below) led by </p><p>Fisheries Deputy Director Plinio Conte then described a </p><p>series of steps that they had taken to bring driftnet </p><p>fishing to an end.  These include: </p><p> </p><p>--Enacting new legislation that requires "compulsory </p><p>dismissal or conversion" (boats could be scrapped or convert </p><p>to another gear type) of the driftnet fishing licenses of </p><p>the last 89 licensed actively fishing Italian driftnet </p><p>vessels.  The legislation entered into force on December </p><p>2002 and allocated a total of 5 million Euro (equally </p><p>distributed between compensations to boat owners and to crew </p><p>members), including funds provided by the Sicily and </p><p>Calabria regional governments. </p><p> </p><p>--Identifying crew members and vessel owners who would be </p><p>compensated under the retirement scheme.  They noted that </p><p>each valid crew member (about 320) would receive 7,500 Euro </p><p>in compensation, even if they convert to another type of </p><p>fishing.  Note:  According to the law, the compensation for </p><p>the owners, who decide to convert to another type of </p><p>fishing, will vary from 9,861 to 60,333 Euro depending on </p><p>vessel tonnage.  If the owners decide to be compensated for </p><p>scrapping these vessels, the compensation (which will also </p><p>include EU funds) will be much higher, varying from 75,000 </p><p>to 353,560 Euro for the same-size vessels.  Italian </p><p>officials told us that "many" owners would apply for the </p><p>scrapping.  End note. </p><p> </p><p>--Canceling the driftnet portions of the fishing licenses of </p><p>all of the 89 remaining vessels. </p><p> </p><p>--Deleting the names of these vessels from the EU vessel </p><p>registry, which contains a unique registry number for each </p><p>vessel. </p><p> </p><p>--Seizing and sealing the nets from all 89 vessels. </p><p>According to the law, the driftnets can be "recycled or </p><p>transformed" and the owners keep the profits of these </p><p>operations. </p><p> </p><p>--Receiving European Commission approval for their </p><p>compensation plan in February 2003.  Part of the </p><p>Commission\'s review included a finding that the buyback </p><p>funds were not a "market-distorting measure."  Note: </p><p>according to the text of the EU approval, the GOI </p><p>compensation to convert is considered "reasonable", since </p><p>the owners would receive only 15 pct and the crew only 50 </p><p>pct of the EU compensation for definitive retirement (as </p><p>mentioned above).  End note. </p><p> </p><p>--Seeking to initiate a uniform sanction scheme among all EU </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>member states in order to reduce disparities in the level of </p><p>sanctions applied for fisheries violations.  Fisheries </p><p>International Affairs Giannella mentioned that the Council </p><p>will establish a catalogue of sanctions to be applied by </p><p>Member States for serious infringements.  Comment:  this is </p><p>a complicated matter because the Justice system is within </p><p>the competency of member states.  End of comment.  Giannella </p><p>also mentioned the idea of establishing a EU Joint </p><p>Inspection Structure at Community level, pooling national </p><p>and EU monitoring and inspection resources for more </p><p>effective implementation of control across the EU. </p><p>Regarding enforcement, Giannella pointed out that non-EU </p><p>(e.g. Malta and Cyprus) and North-African fishermen are </p><p>still allowed to use driftnets.  For this reason, the EU </p><p>will try to transform its driftnet ban into a Mediterranean- </p><p>wide ban, using the instrument of the General Fisheries </p><p>Council for the Mediterranean (GFCM).  According to </p><p>Giannella, Italy insists on the need of a comprehensive </p><p>approach by the EU of Med fisheries issues.  For this </p><p>reason, the GOI has organized the Euro-Mediterranean </p><p>Conference on Fisheries and Agriculture that will take place </p><p>in Venice on November 25-27, 2003. </p><p> </p><p>--Considering the use of marine reserves and marine </p><p>sanctuaries to protect spawning and nursery areas for marine </p><p>species. </p><p> </p><p>4.  Italian officials were not aware of recent NGO reports </p><p>of driftnet fishing out of ports on the island of Ischia, </p><p>but suggested that there will always be some who try to </p><p>break the rules.  They then provided copies of several </p><p>documents that will be forwarded to the Department </p><p>(OES/OMC).  These include:  the July 2002 law establishing </p><p>the mandatory end of driftnet fishing; a summary of driftnet </p><p>enforcement activities for 2002 (through October, the end of </p><p>the fishing season); and related documents.  Note:  2002 </p><p>driftnet enforcement data were already known to us (ref. B). </p><p>In summary, Port Authorities dedicated 15,101 hours and </p><p>93,614 nautical miles to driftnet monitoring in the 2002 </p><p>season.  During their monitoring activity, they caught and </p><p>seized the nets of 9 illegal driftnet vessels in Palermo, 44 </p><p>in Calabria, 19 in Catania, 12 in Bari, 2 in Naples, and 17 </p><p>in Sardinia.  End note. </p><p> </p><p>5.  GOI officials promised to provide information about </p><p>seized or surrendered driftnets recycling and a summary of </p><p>driftnet enforcement efforts for 2003 later in the year. </p><p> </p><p>6.  A list of participants in the meeting follows: </p><p> </p><p>U.S. - Stetson Tinkham (OES/OMC); Federica Signoretti </p><p>(Science Office, Embassy Rome). </p><p> </p><p>Italy - Plinio Conte (Fisheries Deputy Director); Comm. </p><p>Pietro Verna (head of National Center for Fishery Control </p><p>and Operations); Pasquale Giannella (International Affairs </p><p>director); Giovanni Granato (EU Funds Director); and Felice </p><p>Mazzeo (Fishery Regulations Director). </p><p> </p><p>7.    This cable has been cleared by OES/OMS Stetson Tinkam. </p><p> </p><p>Dwyer </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p> 2003ROME03484 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
