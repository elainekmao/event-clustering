<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KATHMANDU 002171 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS, SA/PD AND DS/IP/SA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/14/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PTER, ASEC, CASC, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL:  PURPORTED MAOIST PRESS RELEASE CLAIMS </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY FOR KILLINGS OF EMBASSY GUARDS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. (A) KATHMANDU 2139 </p><p> </p><p>     B. (B) KATHMANDU 2165 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: POL PMAHONEY.  REASON:  1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) On November 15, poloff met with Padma Ratna Tuladhar, </p><p>a long-time leftwing politician known to have contact with </p><p>the Maoists.  (Note:  Tuladhar acted as a facilitator during </p><p>the three rounds of talks held between the Government of </p><p>Nepal and the Maoists from August-November 2001.  End note.) </p><p>Tuladhar asked if the USG were weighing officially </p><p>designating the Maoists as terrorists.  Poloff, under </p><p>previous instructions from the Ambassador, told Tuladhar that </p><p>the Embassy had strong evidence that the December 15, 2001 </p><p>slaying of Embassy Surveillance Detection Unit guard Ramesh </p><p>Manandhar and the November 9 execution of Embassy contract </p><p>guard supervisor Deepak Pokhrel (Ref A) had been committed by </p><p>Maoists.  If truue, those killings constitute grievous </p><p>attacks against U.S. interests.  The USG may thus be </p><p>reviewing whether to place the Maoists on any of several </p><p>terrorist lists, she suggested. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  After COB the same day, a police contact gave RSO </p><p>FSN a copy of a press release, dated November 15, purportedly </p><p>from the Maoist Kathmandu Valley Regional Bureau.  Media </p><p>sources contacted believe the release to be authentic. </p><p>(Note:  We do not recall, among the numerous Maoist press </p><p>releases we have seen, one from the "Valley Regional Bureau." </p><p> End note.)  Among other assertions, the statement claims </p><p>responsibility for the killings of both Manandhar and </p><p>Pokhrel, alleging that the two had been "informing" on </p><p>Maoists.  The release emphasizes "our action is not targeted </p><p>at any tourists from foreign countries, or even at their </p><p>diplomatic missions in Nepal or the employees or staff of </p><p>those missions."  However, "our party has taken action </p><p>recently and killed the security personnel of the American </p><p>Embassy Mr. Deepak Pokhrel.  For a long time, he had been </p><p>saying he was a supporter of the People\'s War and contacted </p><p>our workers, collected information and took the information </p><p>to the administration. . . .Likewise, last year our party </p><p>also took action against Ramesh Manandhar and killed him.  He </p><p>used to inform and help arrest ordinary people walking on the </p><p>street . . . We would like to appeal to all the diplomatic </p><p>missions, including the American Mission, to stop spying.  We </p><p>have no policy of fighting with them unless they come to </p><p>fight with us."  The Embassy has e-mailed the full text of </p><p>the statement to SAFO and SA/INS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  Comment:  The Embassy notes the coincidence of the </p><p>November 9 killing of Deepak Pokhrel with a campaign launched </p><p>by western Maoists in the U.S. and Europe in support of their </p><p>Nepali brethren, which is intended to head off U.S. military </p><p>assistance to Nepal.  Part of this campaign has included a </p><p>petition signed by a wide range of people from various </p><p>fields, including some well-respected individuals (Ref B). </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Comment (cont.):  There have been a number of </p><p>indications recently that the Maoists, for whatever reason, </p><p>are particularly sensitive to being branded as terrorists, </p><p>and that they seemed to find some significance in the fact </p><p>that no Western donor has yet made a formal announcement </p><p>naming them as such.  Given the proximity of our talks with </p><p>Tuladhar and the issuance of this statement, we can only </p><p>conclude that Tuladhar has better and more direct contacts </p><p>than many give him credit for.  The allegations of spying are </p><p>an obvious and thin fabrication for what can only be </p><p>interpreted as two blatant--and deadly--direct attacks </p><p>against American interests. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  Suggested Press Guidance:  The USG condemns the </p><p>killings of its two unarmed security guards on December 15, </p><p>2001, and November 9, 2002.  The perpetrators must be brought </p><p>to justice.  We note the issuance of a press release, </p><p>purportedly by the Maoist Kathmandu Valley Regional Bureau, </p><p>claiming responsibility for these cruel and senseless </p><p>murders.  If true, these callous killings are only the most </p><p>recent evidence the Maoists\' complete disregard for human </p><p>rights and the sanctity of human life.  Our government takes </p><p>these attacks against our personnel in Kathmandu with the </p><p>utmost gravity, and is reviewing various possible steps in </p><p>response to these acts of terror.  End suggested press </p><p>guidance. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
