(U) This message is Sensitive but Unclassified -- </p><p>Please handle accordingly. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  The State Department-sponsored Quick </p><p>Reaction Demining Force (QRDF) is making excellent </p><p>progress in its humanitarian demining operations in </p><p>Jaffna.  Cooperation with the GSL and the Tamil </p><p>community is excellent, with the whole operation reaping </p><p>the U.S. solid kudos.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Since its deployment in Jaffna in northern Sri </p><p>Lanka in late March, the State Department-sponsored QRDF </p><p>program has made excellent progress in its humanitarian </p><p>demining operations in Jaffna.  Thus far, the team, </p><p>which consists of U.S. contractors from RONCO and </p><p>Mozambican deminers, has removed 106 mines and 74 pieces </p><p>of unexploded ordnance (UXO).  Total square meters </p><p>cleared as of mid-May is 10,326.  The majority of the </p><p>mines cleared thus far have been of the anti-personnel </p><p>type. (Note:  The site being demined, which is adjacent </p><p>to the village of Sarasalai, east of Jaffna town, also </p><p>has a high incidence of UXO.  The village is located on </p><p>a former forward defensive line which saw significant </p><p>shelling by both the military and the Tamil Tigers.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Cooperation from the GSL has been excellent. </p><p>Don Smith, the team leader, told us that the QRDF has an </p><p>excellent working relationship with Sri Lankan military </p><p>forces working in the area.  The Sri Lanka Army (SLA), </p><p>for example, is currently providing certain supplies to </p><p>the QRDF, as well as the use of emergency medical </p><p>facilities as needed.  (Note:  FYI:  The SLA is </p><p>currently demining three sites in Jaffna.  In general, </p><p>the military\'s demining is not up to international </p><p>humanitarian standards, which is also the case with </p><p>Tamil Tiger demining.) </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Cooperation with the Tamil community is </p><p>excellent.  Tamils reportedly welcome the efforts of the </p><p>QRDF, with civilians coming forward on a daily basis to </p><p>request assistance in demining their lands or providing </p><p>the QRDF pieces of UXO to dispose of.  Tamil politicians </p><p>have also told Mission how appreciative they are of the </p><p>QRDF\'s efforts. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) COMMENT:  As with its predecessor program in </p><p>Jaffna, the current QRDF operation continues to help the </p><p>U.S. in its relations with the GSL and the Tamil </p><p>community.  (Note:  A previous QRDF was also in place in </p><p>Jaffna last year.)  Moreover, the QRDF\'s efforts </p><p>reinforce our support for the peace process, which is </p><p>going through a rocky period at this time.  U.S. </p><p>assistance in the north also tends to undermine the </p><p>Tigers\' consistent refrain that no international </p><p>assistance is getting through to Tamils.  There is </p><p>little doubt that there is a problem with GSL assistance </p><p>dissemination, but some international projects (like </p><p>QRDF) are up-and-running.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
