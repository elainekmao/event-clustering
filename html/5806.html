<p>UNCLAS HARARE 000337 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF/S AND AF/EX </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JFRAZER </p><p>USDOC FOR 2037 DIEMOND </p><p>PASS USTR ROSA WHITAKER </p><p>TREASURY FOR ED BARBER AND C WILKINSON </p><p>STATE PASS TO USAID FOR MARJORIE COPSON </p><p> </p><p>E. O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, ETRD, EFIN, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: Leading Banker Fears Decision Paralysis </p><p> </p><p>Ref: a) Harare 111  b) Harare 244 </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary:  Unless the GOZ modifies its economic </p><p>policies, the Bankers\' Association President believes its </p><p>once-formidable infrastructure will be irreparably </p><p>damaged.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Standard Chartered Chief Executive and Zimbabwe </p><p>Bankers\' Association President Washington Matsaira told </p><p>Ambassador Sullivan that President Mugabe\'s inner-circle </p><p>"hawks" are subverting the Tripartite Agreement (septel) </p><p>as well as the Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries\' </p><p>(CZI) proposal to devalue the Zimdollar for exporters </p><p>(ref a).  Hardliners -- Justice Minister Patrick </p><p>Chinamasa, Agriculture Minister Joseph Made, Information </p><p>Minister Jonathan Moyo and Public Works Minister Ignatius </p><p>Chombo -- are either still enriching themselves from the </p><p>GOZ\'s interventionist policies (often accessing U.S. </p><p>dollars at the official rate) or unwilling to press </p><p>Mugabe to make a change.  This has led to decision-making </p><p>paralysis, particularly frustrating because CZI\'s </p><p>leadership believed it had convinced all the key players </p><p>of the need to devalue.  Matsaira said a group of </p><p>exporters even persuaded the GOZ to allow a one-time </p><p>parallel market exchange US$ 25 million last month, </p><p>seeming admission that the official rate is untenable. </p><p>There has been no further positive sign from government. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Matsaira notices increasing infrastructure and </p><p>even moral decay in Zimbabwe, symptoms of the economic </p><p>crisis that may become permanent by the year\'s end.  An </p><p>every-man-for-himself dictum is taking grip of a society </p><p>that once exalted community.  The banker sees unmotivated </p><p>teachers and bribe-hungry policemen with an audacity </p><p>unthinkable just 5 years ago.  The brain-drain is so </p><p>severe that it is no longer possible to fill certain </p><p>professional positions at Standard Chartered (in spite of </p><p>the country\'s high unemployment).  Indigenous fuel </p><p>companies clandestinely send their supply of heavily- </p><p>subsidized fuel to neighboring countries.  In sum, </p><p>Matsaira thinks Zimbabwe is gradually being "Zaire-ized," </p><p>a reference to Mobutu Sese Seko\'s misrule in today\'s </p><p>Democratic Republic of the Congo. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>4. (SBU) Matasaira\'s somber observations parallel those </p><p>that lower-grade local employees shared with us a few </p><p>weeks ago (ref b).  Zimbabweans surprise themselves with </p><p>their own growing contempt for laws and social-norms, one </p><p>step in the country\'s rapid metamorphism. </p><p> </p><p>Sullivan </p><p></p></div>
