(C) SUMMARY: ON NOVEMBER 16, A/S RICE, AMBASSADORS </p><p>RENDER AND MCDONALD, AND ECONOFF (NOTETAKER), MET WITH </p><p>FINANCE MINISTER SIMBA MAKONI FOR AN HONEST AND WIDE- </p><p>RANGING 75 MINUTE DISCUSSION.  TAKING PLACE ONLY A FEW </p><p>HOURS BEFORE THE MINISTER PRESENTED HIS FIRST BUDGET TO </p><p>THE PARLIAMENT AND THE NATION, THE MEETING CENTERED ON </p><p>MAKONI\'S EXPERIENCE DEALING WITH PRESIDENT MUGABE, AND </p><p>HIS IN-DEPTH SUGGESTIONS AND ADVICE ON HOW TO APPROACH </p><p>MUGABE AND BRING ABOUT DESIRED RESULTS.  HE ALSO SHARED </p><p>HIS OUTLOOK AND VIEWS ON SOME OF THE MAJOR ISSUES </p><p>CONFRONTING THE GOVERNMENT AND RULING PARTY; AND HIS </p><p>EXPECTATION THAT MUGABE WOULD EMERGE AS THE PARTY\'S </p><p>CANDIDATE FOR THE 2002 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>THOUGH THE SURFACE IS DAUNTING; DIALOGUE, </p><p>AND DEALS, ARE POSSIBLE </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) AFTER INTRODUCTIONS AND OPENING EXCHANGES, MAKONI </p><p>CAME QUICKLY TO HIS OBSERVATIONS AND JUDGEMENTS.  THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  06663  01 OF 03  290907Z </p><p>ECONOMY IS BAD AND THIS IS DUE TO THE POLITICAL CRISIS </p><p>THE COUNTRY IS EXPERIENCING, HE TOLD US.  WHILE THE </p><p>SURFACE APPEARANCE PROVIDED BY PRESIDENT MUGABE IS </p><p>DAUNTING AND VERY NEGATIVE, UNDERNEATH THERE IS THE </p><p>POTENTIAL FOR FLEXIBILITY AND RATIONAL DIALOGUE AND THE </p><p>REAL POSSIBILITY TO EFFECT POSITIVE CHANGE. HE TOLD US </p><p>THAT A WAY OUT OF THE CURRENT DILEMMA IS BEING SOUGHT BY </p><p>THE PRESIDENT, AND CITED AS EVIDENCE BOTH HIS AND </p><p>NKOSANNA MOYO\'S APPOINTMENT TO CABINET.  "THIS WOULD </p><p>NEVER HAVE HAPPENED IF THE NEED FOR CHANGE WAS NOT </p><p>RECOGNIZED BY PRESIDENT MUGABE."  MAKONI FLATLY STATED </p><p>THAT THOSE WHO SAY THERE CAN BE NO POSITIVE CHANGE UNTIL </p><p>PRESIDENT MUGABE IS OFF THE SCENE ARE WRONG.  WHILE THE </p><p>FINANCE MINISTER PERSONALLY BELIEVED MUGABE HAD </p><p>OVERSTAYED HIS TERM ("HIS LEAVING IS OVERDUE"), THE </p><p>PRESIDENT WILL ENGAGE IN STRAIGHT TALK AND SERIOUSLY </p><p>CONSIDER AN OFFERED DEAL THAT HE SEES AS FAVORING HIM. </p><p>"MUGABE IS A MAN OF STRONG VIEWS", MAKONI POINTED OUT, </p><p>"AND SO ONE NEEDS TO RELATE TO HIM IN THE SAME WAY." </p><p>"THIS IS HOW I HAVE GOTTEN RESULTS", HE ADMITTED, CITING </p><p>THE EXAMPLE OF THE DEVALUATION HE WON APPROVAL FOR BY </p><p>LAYING OUT THE MOVE AS A REAL WORLD NECESSITY WHICH THE </p><p>LONGER IGNORED WOULD ONLY CAUSE GREATER POLITICAL HARM TO </p><p>MUGABE ANDQ RULING PARTY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) FURTHER CLARIFYING THE POINT, MAKONI CAREFULLY </p><p>EXPLAINED THAT MUGABE VIEWS EVERYTHING THROUGH THE OPTIC </p><p>OF WHETHER IT THREATENS HIS TENURE.  THEREFORE, ANY </p><p>PROPOSAL MUST BE PACKAGED TO EMPHASIZE BENEFITS FOR </p><p>MUGABE.  IF GAINS CAN BE RATIONALLY LAID OUT AND ARGUED </p><p>FOR, PAIN CAN BE SOLD, HE TOLD US.  THE FINANCE MINISTER </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  06663  01 OF 03  290907Z </p><p>CITED OTHER STEPS HE HAS TAKEN WITH HIS PORTFOLIO (FOR </p><p>EXAMPLE, PERSONNEL AND SPENDING CUTBACKS IN THE 2001 </p><p>BUDGET) AS PAINFUL STEPS HE HAS SOLD AS NECESSARY IF </p><p>MUGABE WISHED TO RUN HIS PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN IN A </p><p>DOMESTIC ENVIRONMENT THAT HAD AT LEAST STARTED TO TURN </p><p>AROUND.  "REMEMBER", HE TOLD US IN A STATEMENT </p><p>APPROACHING THE ZEN, "WHAT APPEARS AND NOT WHAT IS, IS </p><p>WHAT IS IMPORTANT WHEN DEALING WITH MUGABE." </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>MUGABE\'S LAND OPTIC, AND CONSPIRACY IN GENERAL </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) RESPONDING TO A/S RICE\'S AND THE AMBASSADOR\'S </p><p>QUESTION ON THE CURRENT ECONOMIC DANGER FACING THE </p><p>COUNTRY AND THE PRESIDENT\'S RECOGNITION OF IT, THE </p><p>FINANCE MINISTER SHARED WITH US HIS PERCEPTION OF </p><p>MUGABE\'S VIEW OF THE LAND ISSUE, AND ALSO THE DARK FORCES </p><p>ARRAYED AGAINST HIM IN GENERAL.  MAKONI BEGAN HIS </p><p>EXPLANATION BY STATING THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS AWARE OF </p><p>THE ECONOMIC DIFFICULTIES AND UNHAPPINESS OF THE </p><p>POPULACE.  "HOWEVER, HE SEES IT AS CAUSED BY A CONSPIRACY </p><p>AIMED AGAINST HIM, AND SO HE WORKS OFF THE WRONG </p><p>PREMISE," HE TOLD US.

OVER PAST </p><p>MONTHS, THE ENEMY CAMP HAS GROWN. IT IS NOW NO LONGER THE </p><p>WHITE FARMERS ALONE, BUT INCLUDES: ALL FORMER RHODESIANS </p><p>STILL IN ZIMBABWE (I.E., URBAN WHITES); ALL ELITE NON- </p><p>ZANU-PF-PARTY BLACKS (AGAIN MAINLY URBAN); THE SO-CALLED </p><p>\'ZIMBA-BOERS\' (FORMER RHODESIANS LIVING IN SOUTH AFRICA); </p><p>AND, SINCE THE ELECTION, ALL URBAN BLACKS.  ALL THE </p><p>FOREGOING FORM THE "FIFTH COLUMN", MUGABE\'S PEJORATIVE </p><p>TERM FOR THOSE ARRAYED AGAINST HIM.  IN ADDITION, OF </p><p>COURSE, THERE ARE THE EVER-PRESENT FOREIGN IMPERIALISTS </p><p>LED BY GREAT BRITAIN, INCLUDING THE U.S., WHOSE SIZE IN </p><p>THE PERCEIVED-ENEMY FIRMAMENT VARIES DEPENDING ON THE </p><p>TOPIC AND TIMING.  FOR OUR SAKE THE MINISTER FURTHER </p><p>CLARIFIED THE VIEW OF THE U.S. AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL: </p><p>"YOU ARE USUALLY SEEN AS GENERALLY ENLIGHTENED, AND </p><p>SEEKING CONSTRUCTIVE ENGAGEMENT," HE STATED. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) RETURNING TO THE LAND ISSUE, MAKONI EXPLAINED </p><p>THAT MUGABE HAS FIRMLY DECIDED THAT GOING THE RATIONAL, </p><p>MEASURED ROUTE FOR LAND REFORM WILL FAIL HIM; BECAUSE THE </p><p>FIFTH COLUMN FORCES WILL HIDE BEHIND THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>COMMUNITY AND THWART OR STOP THE RESETTLEMENT PROCESS. </p><p>MUGABE BELIEVES THIS IS WHAT HAS OCCURRED SINCE THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  06663  02 OF 03  290907Z </p><p>SEPTEMBER 1998 LAND REFORM CONFERENCE, HIS ENEMIES </p><p>CONTROLLING THE DONORS AND CAUSING THEM TO RENEGE ON </p><p>THEIR PROMISES OF ASSISTANCE AND FUNDING.  "MUGABE WILL </p><p>NEVER SEE OR ADMIT THAT ZIMBABWE ALSO FAILED IN </p><p>FULFILLING ITS PLEDGES," MAKONI STATED, "JUST AS HE WILL </p><p>NEVER ADMIT THAT THERE IS NO RULE OF LAW NOW IN ZIMBABWE </p><p>OR THAT HIS INVASION DIRECTIVE WAS WRONG."  "DISCUSSING </p><p>THAT TOPIC IS USELESS," HE CONTINUED, "AND YOU MUST </p><p>PRESENT YOUR OR THE UNDP\'S PROPOSAL IN A NON-THREATENING </p><p>MANNER THAT ALSO CONTAINS THE GOLDEN RING OF POTENTIAL </p><p>SUCCESS AT THE 2002 POLLS."  "IF YOU COME UP WITH A </p><p>CREDIBLE PROGRAM THAT MEETS MUGABE\'S GOALS, YOU CAN REACH </p><p>AGREEMENT," MAKONI TOLD US.  A/S RICE STATED THAT SHE TOO </p><p>BELIEVED THAT THE UNDP INITIATIVE OFFERED THE BEST CHANCE </p><p>OF CONSTRUCTIVE MOVEMENT FORWARD, CAUTIONING THAT A LOT </p><p>OF WORK HAD TO BE DONE TO REALIZE GOALS AND BENEFITS, AND </p><p>THE COORDINATION OF ALL THE DONORS. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>THE DECEMBER CONGRESS AND THE 2002 CANDIDATE </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) IN RESPONSE TO AN A/S RICE QUESTION ON THE FUTURE </p><p>OF PRESIDENT MUGABE, THE MINISTER OFFERED A NUMBER OF </p><p>OBSERVATIONS.  HE STARTED BY RELATING THAT HE HAD KNOWN </p><p>MUGABE SINCE HIS EARLY DAYS IN POWER, AND FOUND HIM OF </p><p>LATE TO BE MUCH TOUGHER TO READ.  "MUGABE HAS BECOME MUCH </p><p>MORE PRICKLY, AND ONE HAS TO HAVE ONE\'S ARGUMENTS MUCH </p><p>BETTER ORGANIZED AND STRONGLY PRESENTED TO WIN THE DAY." </p><p>MAKONI CONTINUED THAT HIS STRONG GUT FEELING IS THAT </p><p>"MUGABE WILL SOLDIER ON."  THE ISSUE OF SUCCESSION WILL </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  06663  02 OF 03  290907Z </p><p>SURELY COME UP AT THE DECEMBER CONGRESS (EVEN THOUGH IT </p><p>IS NOT ON THE AGENDA), AND MUGABE ALONE WILL DECIDE THE </p><p>ISSUE AS THERE IS NO LOBBY STRONG ENOUGH, OR WILLING </p><p>ENOUGH, TO CARRY THE DAY CONTRARY TO THE PRESIDENT\'S </p><p>WISHES.  "EVEN THOUGH THERE ARE YOUNG ELEMENTS IN THE </p><p>PARTY WHO WANT HIM TO GO," HE STATED, "THIS IS COUNTERED </p><p>BY THE OLD GUARD WHO WHISPER IN BOB\'S EAR THAT \'YOU ARE A </p><p>YOUNG OLD MAN\'." </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>THE CONGO AND DOMESTIC POLITICS </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) THE SESSION DREW TO A CLOSE WITH THE FINANCE </p><p>MINISTER ASKING THE ASSISTANT SECRETARY THE QUESTION, </p><p>"WHAT CAN WE DO HERE TO BETTER THINGS IN YOUR VIEW, FOR </p><p>EXAMPLE IN THE CONGO?"  A/S RICE RESPONDED BY OUTLINING </p><p>IN GENERAL TERMS A POSSIBLE PATH FORWARD THAT CALLED FOR </p><p>GREATER COOPERATION BETWEEN THE EXTERNAL FORCES THAT HAVE </p><p>MUCH AT STAKE AND CAN BRING PRESSURE TO BEAR.  THE GOAL </p><p>IS ADHERENCE TO THE LUSAKA ACCORD; AND WITHDRAWAL OF THE </p><p>FOREIGN FORCES.  A/S RICE URGED DIALOGUE WITH RWANDA AND </p><p>UGANDA TO START A REAL EXIT, AND ALLOW KABILA TO TREAD </p><p>DOWN A PATH OF HIS OWN MAKING. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ0685 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  06663  03 OF 03  290907Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   ACQ-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00 </p><p>      SMEC-00  CTME-00  DINT-00  DODE-00  DOEE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00 </p><p>      DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00   EXIM-01  E-00     FAAE-00  FBIE-00 </p><p>      VC-00    FRB-00   H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   ITC-01   LAB-01 </p><p>      L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00 </p><p>      PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    IRM-00   SSO-00 </p><p>      SS-00    STR-00   T-00     USIE-00  FMP-00   PMB-00   DSCC-00 </p><p>      DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /010W </p><p>                  ------------------A52AA4  290907Z /38 </p><p>P 290902Z NOV 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 7733 </p><p>INFO SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY LONDON </p><p>AMEMBASSY PARIS </p><p>USDOC WASHDC </p><p>NSC WASHDC </p><p>DEPT OF TREASURY WASHDC </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 HARARE 006663 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF, AF/S, AF/EPS, EB/IFD/ODF, EB/TPP/ODC </p><p>TREASURY FOR ED BARBER AND BARAK HOFFMAN </p><p>USDOC FOR 2037/ERIC HENDERSON </p><p>STATE PASS USTR/RWHITTAKER </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p>LONDON FOR CHARLES GURNEY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  06663  03 OF 03  290907Z </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/29/08 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, PREL, EAGR, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: A/S RICE MEETS WITH FINANCE MINISTER SIMBA </p><p>MAKONI </p><p> </p><p>8.
