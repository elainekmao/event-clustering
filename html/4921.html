<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 000014 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>C O R R E C T E D  C O P Y////PARAS TWO AND FOUR//// </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR NEA AND PRM </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:DECL:12/31/12 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PREF, KPAL, KWBG, IS, JO </p><p>SUBJECT:  PLO REFUGEE AFFAIRS OFFICIAL QUIETLY TRYING TO </p><p>LAY GROUNDWORK FOR COMPROMISE ON RIGHT OF RETURN </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A) JERUSALEM 3982 </p><p> </p><p>      B) JERUSALEM 3541 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY DCM GREG BERRY PER 1.5 (b) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary:  Jordan-based PLO Refugee Affairs official </p><p>Mohamed Abu Bakr told refcoord December 24 that he and West </p><p>Bank Refugee Affairs Director Saji Salameh are quietly </p><p>trying to prepare the Palestinian refugee community for </p><p>what they see as an inevitable compromise on the right of </p><p>return.  Working in secret -- and without the knowledge of </p><p>either Abu Mazen or de facto PLO Refugee Affairs Department </p><p>head Marwan Abdelhamid -- Abu Bakr and Salameh are seeking </p><p>funding from the Canadian and Norwegian governments for </p><p>public opinion surveys and a broad public relations </p><p>campaign that would convince Palestinians of the need to </p><p>think pragmatically about right of return.  Abu Bakr said </p><p>they will not raise the proposal with PLO or PA leadership </p><p>until they have received Canadian and Norwegian reaction to </p><p>their proposal.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) In a December 24 meeting with refcoord, Jordan- </p><p>based PLO Department of Refugee Affairs Director (for </p><p>Palestinian refugees in Jordan, Syria and Lebanon) Mohamed </p><p>Abu Bakr dismissed as "nonsense" the notion that "five </p><p>million Palestinians will return to a country of five </p><p>million Israelis."  Abu Bakr told refcoord that </p><p>Palestinians need to think pragmatically about the right of </p><p>return and start preparing public opinion now for an </p><p>eventual, inevitable compromise.  In order to do so, Abu </p><p>Bakr said, the PLO must conduct studies and surveys of the </p><p>entire Palestinian population, including those not </p><p>typically included in the diaspora such as the 45,000 1948 </p><p>refugees believed to be resident in Iraq.  Abu Bakr </p><p>believes that any settlement made without a comprehensive </p><p>survey will not last, as the absence of a unified </p><p>Palestinian position would provide a pretext for </p><p>rejectionists to disavow and destroy the settlement. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) In order to prepare the groundwork for what they </p><p>see as an inevitable compromise, Abu Bakr said that he and </p><p>PLO Refugee Affairs West Bank Director Saji Salameh are </p><p>seeking funding from the Canadian and Norwegian governments </p><p>to conduct studies and surveys, followed by a wide-scale </p><p>public relations campaign to convince Palestinians of the </p><p>need to compromise on the right of return.  Abu Bakr </p><p>cautioned that neither Abu Mazen nor de facto head of the </p><p>Department of Palestinian Affairs Marwan Abdelhamid are </p><p>aware of this plan; neither he nor Salameh wanted to raise </p><p>the proposal until they had received an initial reaction </p><p>and hopefully a promise of funding from the Canadians and </p><p>the Norwegians.  Salameh was to have meet with the </p><p>Canadians on the margins of a late November Geneva forum on </p><p>compensation, but was unable to travel due to health </p><p>problems.  Abu Bakr promised to brief refcoord as soon as </p><p>he had reaction from the Canadians and Norwegians. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) When queried about the timing of his proposal -- </p><p>and specifically why Abu Bakr believes Palestinians might </p><p>be receptive to the idea of compromise when the situation </p><p>on the ground in the West Bank and Gaza had deteriorated so </p><p>dramatically over the last two years -- Abu Bakr said the </p><p>Palestinians havc "no choice" but to compromise.  (Note: </p><p>PLO Refugee Affairs West Bank Director Salameh appears to </p><p>have reversed his early position that the timing wasn\'t </p><p>right for a public debate on the issue -- see ref b.) </p><p>Although political realities dictate that PLO and PA </p><p>officials must use "different language" when discussing the </p><p>right of return in public, Abu Bakr said that more </p><p>pragmatic statements, such as those made by Sari Nusseibeh, </p><p>reflect the reality of the PA\'s position.  While little </p><p>appears to be moving on a political level between the </p><p>Israelis and the Palestinians, Abu Bakr believes that the </p><p>Palestinians cannot afford to waste time by not pushing </p><p>forward on their own internal political issues.  Should the </p><p>Israelis decided to negotiate, Abu Bakr said, political </p><p>progress could come very quickly and the Palestinian public </p><p>needs to be convinced of the importance of compromise.  To </p><p>this end, Abu Bakr and Salameh havc decided to change the </p><p>focus of the Department of Refugee Affairs, away from </p><p>humanitarian assistance projects and toward broader </p><p>political mobilization such as their proposed survey and PR </p><p>campaign. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Comment: Given the vehemence with which the PLO </p><p>publicly denounced Sari Nusseibeh\'s October 2002 proposal </p><p>for compromise on the right of return (ref a), it is </p><p>unlikely that the PLO leadership will publicly embrace Abu </p><p>Bakr and Salameh\'s proposal.  Yet their proposal reflects a </p><p>core truth essential to any long-term settlement:  that the </p><p>C O R R E C T E D  C O P Y/////PARAS TWO AND FOUR////// </p><p>Palestinian public -- both within the West Bank and Gaza </p><p>and elsewhere -- will need to be convinced of the </p><p>importance of compromise on the right of return.  Only a </p><p>serious internal Palestinian debate will reduce the gap </p><p>between public and private PLO rhetoric on this pivotal </p><p>question -- though the present circumstances hardly seem </p><p>propitious for a dispassionate discussion of anything </p><p>connected with the refugee issue. </p><p> </p><p>6.
