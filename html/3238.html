<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001563 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR AF/S AND AF/PD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, CASC </p><p>SUBJECT: TRIAL OF ANDREW MELDRUM CONTINUED UNTIL JULY 12 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.   THE TRIAL OF AMERICAN CITIZEN ANDREW MELDRUM, CHARGED </p><p>    UNDER ZIMBABWE\'S CONTROVERSIAL ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND </p><p>    PROTECTION OF PRIVACY ACT (AIPPA), CONTINUED THIS MORNING. </p><p>    THE PROSECUTION FINISHED PRESENTING ITS EVIDENCE. </p><p>    MELDRUM\'S LAWYER THEN MADE AN APPLICATION FOR THE CASE TO </p><p>    BE DISCHARGED AS, IN HER OPINION, THE STATE HAD CLEARLY </p><p>    FAILED TO ESTABLISH A PRIMA FACIE CASE AGAINST MELDRUM. </p><p>    THE PROSECUTION ARGUED IT HAD ESTABLISHED THE NECESSARY </p><p>    EVIDENCE OF MELDRUM\'S GUILT.  MAGISTRATE GODFREY MACHEYO </p><p>    THEN CONTINUED THE CASE UNTIL JULY 12. </p><p> </p><p>2.   MELDRUM, A ZIMBABWEAN RESIDENT AND CORRESPONDENT FOR </p><p>    THE GUARDIAN NEWSPAPER (UK) HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF "PUBLISHING </p><p>    FALSEHOODS" IN AN APRIL 24TH ARTICLE ABOUT A WOMAN </p><p>    ALLEGEDLY BEHEADED BY RULING PARTY SUPPORTERS.  MELDRUM </p><p>    PICKED UP THE STORY FROM ZIMBABWE\'S DAILY NEWS, WHICH HAS </p><p>    SINCE ADMITTED THAT THE ALLEGATIONS OF BEHEADING WERE FALSE </p><p>    AND OFFERED A FORMAL APOLOGY. </p><p> </p><p>3.   THE CRUX OF MELDRUM\'S DEFENSE THUS FAR SEEMS TO BE THE </p><p>    ISSUE OF JURISDICTION.  CAN THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE </p><p>    APPLY AIPPA TO AN ARTICLE PUBLISHED IN A BRITISH NEWSPAPER </p><p>    WHICH IS NOT SOLD IN ZIMBABWE?  THE PROSECUTION CONTENDS </p><p>    THAT ZIMBABWEANS MAY EASILY ACCESS MELDRUM\'S GUARDIAN PIECE </p><p>    VIA THE INTERNET AND THAT INTERNET DOWNLOADING CONSTITUTES </p><p>    "PUBLICATION IN ZIMBABWE." </p><p> </p><p>4.   EMBASSY OFFICIALS ARE IN REGULAR COMMUNICATION WITH </p><p>    MELDRUM AND WILL CONTINUE TO ATTEND HIS TRIAL. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
