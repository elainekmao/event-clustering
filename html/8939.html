<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 SANAA 001453 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/24/2013 </p><p>TAGS: MARR, PARM, PREL, MNUC, MASS, KN, YM, COUNTER TERRORISM </p><p>SUBJECT: U/S BOLTON\'S VISIT TO YEMEN: MEETING WITH </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL ATOMIC ENERGY ADVISOR </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Charge Alan G. Misenheimer for Reasons 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S/NF)  Begin summary:  On June 17, Under Secretary John </p><p>Bolton met with Dr. Moustafa Bahran, Chairman of the Yemeni </p><p>National Atomic Energy Commission (NATEC) and science advisor </p><p>to ROYG President Saleh.  Discussing the U.S. campaign to </p><p>target and cut off revenue that funds North Korea\'s nuclear </p><p>program, Bahran advised concentrating on the Ministry of </p><p>Defense (MOD) and suggested the U.S. keep Yemen\'s development </p><p>needs in mind.  Bahran outlined his work with the IAEA to </p><p>secure nuclear materials and radioactive sources, proposed a </p><p>joint Yemen-U.S.-UK-France resolution on the security of </p><p>radioactive sources, and suggested a regional initiative to </p><p>strengthen nuclear and radioactive controls.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>Yemen-DPRK Cooperation </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S/NF)  During a working breakfast on June 17, U/S Bolton </p><p>and the Chairman of Yemen,s National Atomic Energy </p><p>Commission Dr. Moustafa Bahran discussed several issues, </p><p>including Yemen\'s relationship with the DPRK.  Bolton noted </p><p>that, while the U.S. is pursuing a diplomatic solution, it is </p><p>also working to undermine the DPRK\'s nuclear program by </p><p>stopping weapons sales and other transactions that provide </p><p>funding.  Transit and purchasing countries, especially those </p><p>in the Middle East, must say "No" to the DPRK.  He called </p><p>Yemen the most important stop on his tour because of its </p><p>known DPRK SCUD missile purchases, highlighted by the </p><p>December 2002 interception of the So San cargo vessel.  The </p><p>time has come for ROYG to join the international community in </p><p>denouncing North Korea\'s unacceptable behavior. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S/NF)  Bahran said that Yemen-DPRK cooperation is purely </p><p>a question of cost.  The U.S. must convince the Ministry of </p><p>Defense (MOD), not the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA), of </p><p>the importance of this issue.  The MOD would have no problem </p><p>working with the U.S. if convinced the U.S. offered </p><p>affordable, realistic alternatives.   However, Bahran </p><p>cautioned, if the price difference is too high, MOD will </p><p>object. </p><p> </p><p>4. (S/NF) U/S Bolton suggested that the positive political </p><p>gains of ending cooperation with the DPRK should also be </p><p>calculated into the "final price".  The cooperation that led </p><p>to resolution of the So San incident is only one example of </p><p>the larger U.S.-Yemen partnership that the ROYG should take </p><p>into consideration.  Bahran advised that if the USG shows </p><p>consideration for Yemen\'s critical development needs, the </p><p>DPRK problem would end. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (S/NF)  U/S Bolton said that during a recent meeting of </p><p>11 countries in Madrid -- including Japan, a major donor to </p><p>Yemen -- a decision was made to conduct more operations like </p><p>the Spanish interdiction of the So San.  In light of the </p><p>growing threat posed by North Korea\'s weapons program, Bolton </p><p>noted these countries are willing to accept the burden of </p><p>interdiction costs. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p>Security of Nuclear Materials and Radioactive Sources </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  Bahran noted that, in December 2000, Yemen was one </p><p>of the first countries to raise the issue of protection and </p><p>physical security of radioactive sources (PSRS).  In 2002, </p><p>Yemen co-drafted and co-sponsored IAEA resolution </p><p>GC/46/Res/13.  While the resolution is adequate, it does not </p><p>do enough to address PSRS.  Bahran then outlined his efforts </p><p>to enlist support for the passage of a three-part resolution </p><p>at September\'s IAEA General Conference covering illicit </p><p>trafficking, nuclear materials, and radioactive sources.  He </p><p>met with the French Nuclear Commission in May, and plans to </p><p>approach his counterparts in the U.S. and the UK later this </p><p>summer to garner support for the resolution.  U/S Bolton then </p><p>offered to assist Bahran in scheduling a meeting with </p><p>Secretary Abraham at the Department of Energy. </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>Regional Initiative </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  Bahran cited poor security in many Gulf states as </p><p>the impetus for the formation of a regional authority to </p><p>harmonize PSRS licensing and enforcement.  By contributing to </p><p>regional security, a ROYG-led initiative might also help </p><p>Yemen\'s bid to join the Gulf Cooperation Council.  Bahran </p><p>said President Saleh would send him to talk to Gulf leaders, </p><p>but ROYG would appreciate U.S. assistance to set the stage </p><p>with the GCC.  U/S Bolton agreed to carry Bahran\'s ideas back </p><p>to Washington, but again suggested he raise these issues with </p><p>Secretary Abraham directly. </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  Comment:  Dr. Bahran obviously enjoyed his meeting </p><p>with U/S Bolton, and asked the U/S when he was meeting with </p><p>the President.  At that point, no meeting had been requested </p><p>or  scheduled.  Two hours later, President Saleh\'s office </p><p>called to request an immediate meeting at the Presidential </p><p>Palace (septel).  It appears likely that Bahran was directly </p><p>responsible, reflecting the close relations between President </p><p>Saleh and his science advisors. </p><p> </p><p>MISENHEIMER </p><p></p></div>
