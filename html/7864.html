<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ADANA 0130 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINS, PGOV, PHUM, TU, IZ, ADANA, Press Summaries </p><p>SUBJECT:  SOUTHEAST TURKEY PRESS SUMMARY, </p><p>          MAY 6, 2003 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  This is the Southeastern Turkey press summary </p><p>for May 6, 2003.  Please note that Turkish press </p><p>reports often contain errors or exaggerations; </p><p>AmConsulate Adana does not vouch for the accuracy </p><p>of the reports summarized here. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>POLITICAL, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  Turkiye: Although the US had announced the </p><p>PKK/KADEK as a "terrorist organization," the US </p><p>gave permission to the PKK/KADEK to open an </p><p>office in Mosul. It is believed that the US has </p><p>been disregarding Turkey\'s warnings about the PKK </p><p>because, after the collapse of Saddam\'s regime, </p><p>the US turned a blind eye to the PKK\'s seizure of </p><p>some of Iraq\'s weapons in northern Iraq. The PKK </p><p>has expedited its reorganization in northern Iraq </p><p>and has opened many offices throughout the </p><p>country, including Mosul. It is further claimed </p><p>that the US is trying to take its revenge from </p><p>Turkey because of the TGNA\'s failure to endorse </p><p>the motion that would have allowed the deployment </p><p>of US troops in Turkey. It is also reported that </p><p>the PKK has been making serious preparations to </p><p>infiltrate into Turkey again. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  Evrensel: In order to protest the shortening </p><p>of the time allowed for Abdullah Ocalan to meet </p><p>with his family and lawyers at Imrali prison, all </p><p>KADEK defendants in Turkey will boycott their </p><p>weekly meetings with their families. Making an </p><p>announcement on behalf of all KADEK inmates, </p><p>Nasrullah Kuran, said shortening Abdullah </p><p>Ocalan\'s meeting with his family and lawyers to </p><p>15 and 45 minutes respectively was inhumane and </p><p>illegal, and such applications are intended to </p><p>undermine the Kurdish-Turkish brotherhood. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  Sabah: Sabah paper claimed that, according to </p><p>two documents seized from Saddam\'s Secret </p><p>Intelligence Organization\'s (SIO) archives in </p><p>Baghdad, the PKK and Osman Ocalan had established </p><p>ties with the SIO. The first letter, written by </p><p>Osman Ocalan, gave information about former Prime </p><p>Minister Ecevit\'s visit to the US in January </p><p>2002, and suggested persuading the Prime Minister </p><p>about the Northern Front. The second document </p><p>suggested taking advantage of the PKK for </p><p>contacting the DHKP-C (Revolutionist Peoples </p><p>Communist Party-Front) which wanted to attack </p><p>Incirlik AFB in Adana. The documents indicated </p><p>the presence of a liaison between the PKK and </p><p>Iraq\'s Intelligence Organization. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  Turkiye: The President of the Executive Board </p><p>of Gaziantep-based Sanko Holding, Abdulkadir </p><p>Konukoglu, gave a one-million USD check to Prime </p><p>Minister Erdogan in order to address the wounds </p><p>of the earthquake in Bingol. The money was raised </p><p>in a campaign in Gaziantep to help the earthquake </p><p>victims. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  Turkiye/Milli Gazete/Milliyet: The Chief </p><p>Public Prosecutor of Bingol, M. Ali Erbay, said </p><p>an investigation was started against the </p><p>contractors, comptrollers, and project designers </p><p>of the buildings that collapsed in the </p><p>earthquake. Erbay said a warrant of arrest had </p><p>been issued for the contractor of the boarding </p><p>school that collapsed killing 84 students. The </p><p>contractor would face between one to six years of </p><p>imprisonment for failure of his obligations. In a </p><p>recent cabinet meeting, the government decided to </p><p>build 2,566 houses for the earthquake victims by </p><p>the end of the year. The government blamed the </p><p>PKK for the earthquake-victims\' demonstrations in </p><p>Bingol. After the quake in Bingol, the boarding </p><p>schools in the region are being inspected. </p><p>Because of cracks in the buildings, 500 students </p><p>in the boarding schools in Batman were sent to </p><p>other schools. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  Turkiye: The sound-bomb that exploded in </p><p>front of the Finance-Investment building on Inonu </p><p>Street in Mersin at 22:30 last night caused </p><p>material damages. No organization has claimed </p><p>responsibility. According to police officials, an </p><p>investigation is underway. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  Cumhuriyet: In his address at DEHAP\'s </p><p>Provincial Convention in Diyarbakir, DEHAP\'s </p><p>Chair, Mehmet Abbasoglu, claimed that his party </p><p>did not compete with other political parties in </p><p>the November 3 General Elections; rather, DEHAP </p><p>competed with the public prosecutors. Abbasoglu </p><p>stated, "As a political party founded five years </p><p>ago, the government did not give us any financial </p><p>support, and was trying to close us down </p><p>permanently." Abbasoglu added that the Prime </p><p>Minister did not visit the Bingol Municipality </p><p>after the earthquake to express his condolences </p><p>to the people, and, therefore, the Prime Minister </p><p>should apologize to the inhabitants of Bingol. </p><p>Abbasoglu claimed that isolation was being </p><p>imposed on Abdullah Ocalan at Imrali Island, and </p><p>it was a shame that people from Turkey could not </p><p>go to the island. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  Bolge: Because of the rumors that DYP\'s Adana </p><p>Provincial Chairman, Yavuz Tekeli, and Seyhan </p><p>District Chairman, Mustafa Tumer, will be </p><p>terminated by the party\'s headquarters, both </p><p>chairmen will resign from their parties today. It </p><p>is also reported that DYP\'s chairmen for Yuregir </p><p>and Kozan districts have also been making </p><p>preparations for their resignations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ECONOMIC AND AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENTS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  Tercuman: The Mardin Cement Plant signed an </p><p>agreement with Syria to export cement to that </p><p>country. According to the first phase of the </p><p>agreement, 250 thousand tons of cement will be </p><p>exported. The director of the plant, Ilker Guner, </p><p>announced that they already had achieved their </p><p>export goals for 2003, and they were now working </p><p>on their export objectives in 2004. He added that </p><p>they would make USD 11 million from the exports </p><p>to Syria. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  Radikal: After four months of closure, the </p><p>Habur Border Gate between Turkey and Iraq was </p><p>reopened to transit transportation as of </p><p>yesterday. The people in Silopi and Cizre are </p><p>extremely happy with the reopening of the gate </p><p>because the gate is perceived to be the artery of </p><p>the economy in the region. </p><p>HOLTZ </p><p></p></div>
