<p>UNCLAS HARARE 000232 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PDPA FOR DALTON, MITCHELL AND SIMS </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: INFORMATION MINISTER SAYS DAILY NEWS IS "ILLEGAL" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   In the continuing legal battle between the Associated </p><p>      Newspapers of Zimbabwe (ANZ), publishers of the independent </p><p>      daily "The Daily News," and the government of Zimbabwe over </p><p>      the mandatory registration of media houses and </p><p>      accreditation of journalists under the controversial Access </p><p>      to Information and Protection of Privacy Act (AIPPA), </p><p>      Information Minister Jonathan Moyo, in his opposing </p><p>      affidavit filed in the Supreme Court this week, has accused </p><p>      the newspaper of "operating illegally."  To date, the </p><p>      newspaper has neither applied for registration nor </p><p>      instructed its journalists to apply for accreditation at </p><p>      the government-controlled Media and Information Commission. </p><p>      ANZ filed an urgent application in the Supreme Court "to </p><p>      declare invalid and devoid of legal effect, sections of the </p><p>      Act which infringe on the rights of freedom of expression, </p><p>      association and compulsory acquisition of property provided </p><p>      for in the Constitution."  The Chairman of the Media and </p><p>      Information Commission, Tafataona Mahoso, has also filed an </p><p>      opposing affidavit in support of the Information Minister </p><p>      Jonathan Moyo.  No date has been set for the hearing of the </p><p>      matter. </p><p> </p><p>  2.   Meanwhile two international news agencies, Reuters and </p><p>      Agence France Press have obtained accreditation for their </p><p>      bureaus and news staff in Zimbabwe.  They submitted their </p><p>      fees in United States dollars, as demanded by the Media and </p><p>      Information Commission.  The Associated Press (AP) declined </p><p>      and closed its bureau, but retained two correspondents. </p><p>      Zimbabwean correspondents for foreign media have been </p><p>      advised by their lawyers that paying in American dollars </p><p>      would violate exchange control regulations - which bar </p><p>      Zimbabwe citizens and permanent residents from paying a </p><p>      Zimbabwean body such as the Media Commission in foreign </p><p>      currency.  The Media and Information Commission is yet to </p><p>      decide on the way forward in terms of the payments issue. </p><p>      Under AIPPA all those who have been refused accreditation </p><p>      must cease practicing or risk being arrested. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
