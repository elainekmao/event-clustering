<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 004477 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARN, NEA/PA, NEA/AIA, INR/NESA, R/MR, </p><p>I/GNEA, B/BXN, B/BRN, NEA/PPD, NEA/IPA FOR ALTERMAN </p><p>USAID/ANE/MEA </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH </p><p>PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p> </p><p>TAGS: KMDR JO </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON IRAQ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                        Summary </p><p> </p><p>-- The lead story in all papers today, July 21, </p><p>highlights King Abdullah\'s instruction to the current </p><p>Prime Minister to dissolve and reform a cabinet to </p><p>coincide with the formation of the newly-elected </p><p>Jordanian parliament.  The new government is expected </p><p>to be announced today.  Other lead stories highlight </p><p>"continued military and political deterioration" in </p><p>Iraq, with the killing of more U.S. soldiers.  Front- </p><p>page reports emphasized a "lack of movement" in the </p><p>recent meetings between Israeli PM Sharon and </p><p>Palestinian PM Abbas, particularly on the issue of the </p><p>release of Palestinian prisoners. </p><p> </p><p>                 Editorial Commentary </p><p> </p><p>-- "America\'s Political Parties in Iraq are Becoming </p><p>Isolated" </p><p> </p><p>Chief Editor Taher Udwan writes on the back page of </p><p>independent, mass-appeal Arabic daily Al-Arab Al-Yawm </p><p>(07/20):  "Once again, we feel optimistic, not just </p><p>because of the escalating resistance against the </p><p>occupation, but also because of the return to life of </p><p>Iraqi society, even though this is being done through </p><p>sectarianism never known in Iraq before.  It does not </p><p>matter as long as this sectarianism is increasingly </p><p>supporting anti-occupation slogans and is in defense </p><p>of the freedom and independence of Iraq.  The </p><p>demonstrations that took place in Baghdad, Koufa, </p><p>Basra and other Iraqi cities stressed that `America\'s </p><p>parties\' that have arrived aboard American tanks are </p><p>now besieged and isolated, as the Iraqi people prove, </p><p>day in and day out, that they will not be an American </p><p>`colony\'." </p><p> </p><p>-- "Why the resistance?" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Fahd Fanek writes on the back page of </p><p>semi-official, influential Arabic daily Al-Rai </p><p>(07/21):  "Every action has an equal reaction that is </p><p>reversed in direction, and the reaction to a foreign </p><p>occupation is national resistance.  This is a sacred </p><p>law of nature, which cannot be weakened by some of </p><p>those who are cooperating with the occupiers on the </p><p>pretext that the occupation is a reality and must thus </p><p>be acknowledged and cooperated with.  What applies to </p><p>the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza </p><p>applies to the American occupation of Iraq. </p><p>Resistance is not only the right of the people who </p><p>reside under the occupation, but is their duty..  We </p><p>will likely soon see, under the impact of the </p><p>resistance, an attempt to internationalize or Arabize </p><p>the occupation by brining in mercenary armies that </p><p>would implement the will and desire of the occupation </p><p>and save the blood of the American soldiers." </p><p> </p><p>-- "The scapegoat" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Bater Wardam writes on the op-ed page </p><p>of center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(07/21):  "Whether it was an assassination or a </p><p>suicide, the death of David Kelly, the British WMD </p><p>expert, is the beginning for exposing the biggest lie </p><p>in the history of international politics.  The cost of </p><p>this lie must be paid by those who perpetrated it by </p><p>completely ending their political lives, and here we </p><p>are referring to Tony Blair and George Bush.  The </p><p>leaders of the two biggest democratic countries in the </p><p>world have been lying to their people, to the world </p><p>and to the media throughout the months that preceded </p><p>the war on Iraq.  We in the Arab world have always </p><p>known it was a lie..  This political scandal must be </p><p>paid for by George Bush and Tony Blair alone.  David </p><p>Kelly and George Tenet must not become the scapegoats </p><p>for the biggest political lie in the history of the </p><p>United States and Britain.  Most importantly, the </p><p>American and British people must never believe any </p><p>similar lies that would be told against Iran or </p><p>Syria." </p><p>-- "With the Iraqi people\'s choice" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Musa Hawamdeh writes on the op-ed page </p><p>of center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(07/21):  "I have been surprised that some people </p><p>continue to refer to an article I wrote after the fall </p><p>of Baghdad in which I criticized the former Iraqi </p><p>regime, although I did not overlook the American and </p><p>Zionist motives in Iraq, and expressed my categorical </p><p>rejection of the war.  Some people misinterpreted my </p><p>criticism as welcoming the Americans and the British </p><p>to occupy Iraq.  This is utterly false..  Some people </p><p>want to prevent us from expressing our opinion freely </p><p>and honestly, as if our criticism of the Iraqi </p><p>President\'s policy justifies or supports the </p><p>occupation.  I do not know who would promote the </p><p>current thinking that you are either with Saddam, a </p><p>victim or a victimizer, or with the Americans, as if </p><p>you cannot reject the American occupation and reject </p><p>the policy of the former regime together..  I still </p><p>believe that the Saddam Hussein regime committed major </p><p>and fatal errors.  True, his only good-doing is marked </p><p>by his stand against the United States and Israel </p><p>after 1991, his call for liberating Palestine from the </p><p>sea to the river, although he did go into Kuwait in </p><p>1990 and into Iran in 1980 instead of Palestine, and </p><p>the fact that he has an Arab nationalistic thinking. </p><p>However, that does not prevent seeing the negative </p><p>aspects and the disastrous policies of this regime, </p><p>its contempt for freedom of expression, and its use of </p><p>the security and intelligence apparatus to crack down </p><p>against intellectuals and journalists.  All these </p><p>errors, however, do not give America the right to </p><p>occupy Iraq, change its regime, cancel its army and </p><p>its party, and form the sectarian governing council. </p><p>We support the Iraqi resistance whatever its direction </p><p>is, and if Saddam has something to do with it, we </p><p>still support the resistance.  We believe that Saddam </p><p>will not return as a president for Iraq and the </p><p>Iraqis, and that they alone are the masters of their </p><p>political future.  We, however, support the expulsion </p><p>of the Americans and the British from Iraq by all </p><p>means possible and we believe no cooperation, whether </p><p>on the Iraqi or Arab level, should take place with </p><p>this unjust occupation." </p><p> </p><p>-- "Who killed David Kelly?" </p><p> </p><p>Columnist Usama Sharif writes on the op-ed page of </p><p>center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(07/21):  "Clearly, the Iraqi issue, in both its </p><p>military and political aspects, is going to upset the </p><p>leaders of the Anglo-American coalition for a long </p><p>time, and may even threaten the hopes of the two </p><p>leaders of remaining in power.  While resistance </p><p>actions against the occupation are escalating and more </p><p>and more American soldiers are falling in the streets </p><p>of Iraqi cities and villages, the threads of the </p><p>political scandal are unraveling and public opinion </p><p>increasingly believes that its government meant to </p><p>mislead it to impose the option of going to war.  The </p><p>question that follows Kelly\'s death is why did Blair </p><p>and Bush resort to these tricks to launch the war and </p><p>what is the real reason for occupying Iraq?  More </p><p>importantly, will this scandal oust the two most </p><p>powerful leaders in the world?" </p><p> </p><p>HALE </p><p></p></div>
