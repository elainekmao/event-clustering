<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 ANKARA 000611 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EUR/SE, EUR/PGI, OES/PCI </p><p>PLEASE PASS EPA (BFREEMAN, HHUYNH) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O.12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: SENV, TBIO, PGOV, ECON, TU </p><p>SUBJECT:  QUENCHING THE THIRST: WATER FOR TURKEY\'S </p><p>HOUSEHOLDS </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary.  Turkey has invested $30 billion over the past </p><p>five decades in a massive water management system that </p><p>challenges the limitations of its semi-arid climate.  As a </p><p>result, Turkey provides household water supply systems to 70 </p><p>percent of its population, including 62 percent in rural </p><p>areas.  The thirsty system requires an annual $2 billion </p><p>investment and faces financial and institutional challenges </p><p>as well as threats to supply and quality. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Long-term strategy: 100 percent capture </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  In recent decades, Turkey has built 211 large and 765 </p><p>small dams that irrigate 4.5 million ha of land, generate </p><p>42,229 GWh/year of energy and provide 2 billion m3 of </p><p>potable water to 20 million people in 14 cities. Only India </p><p>and China have built more dams. To finance its water </p><p>infrastructure, Turkey has received IBRD/IDA support, </p><p>including $942.7 million for water supply and sewage </p><p>projects, $797.9 million for electric power and $118 million </p><p>for agriculture projects.  This effort has enabled Turkey to </p><p>capture 42 billion meters cubed (m3) of its 110 billion m3 </p><p>of exploitable water.  By comparison, exploitable water in </p><p>Greece is about half (62 billion m3) and a hundred times </p><p>less in Israel (1.65 billion m3). However, Turkey\'s water </p><p>per capita has fallen from 1,950 m3 to 1,580 m3 from 1990 to </p><p>2000 due to increases in population, urbanization and </p><p>industrialization as well as a decrease in renewable </p><p>resources. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  To provide adequate supply for its 67 million people, </p><p>the General Directorate of State Hydraulic Works (DSI) </p><p>within the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources (MOENR) </p><p>developed a 30-year plan to capture all exploitable water by </p><p>2030. This plan requires $ 2 billion annually for new </p><p>construction and operations.  As with previous years, the </p><p>allocation for 2002 fell short, this time at $1.2 billion. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  Seventy five (75) percent of water captured goes to </p><p>agriculture.  About 15 percent goes for industrial use and </p><p>the remaining 10 percent for household purposes.  The </p><p>remainder of this cable addresses domestic water supply. </p><p>Septels will address water for hydropower and agriculture. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Domestic supply: Slightly behind world average </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. NATIONAL AND RURAL SUPPLY. Water supply systems serve </p><p>about 70 percent of the population, including 62 percent of </p><p>those living in Turkey\'s 34,720 rural villages.  These </p><p>figures fall below WHO estimates that 82 percent of the </p><p>world\'s overall population and 71 percent of the world\'s </p><p>rural population are served by water supply systems. </p><p>Turkey\'s numbers show a stronger water infrastructure for </p><p>overall and rural populations than do WHO measurements for </p><p>overall and rural populations in Africa (62 and 47 percent, </p><p>respectively), but a less complete infrastructure than </p><p>Europe (96 and 87 percent) and Asia (81 and 75 percent). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. MUNICIPAL SUPPLY.  Turkey\'s municipal water systems reach </p><p>95 percent of the total municipal population.  This number </p><p>compares favorably to WHO estimates of municipal systems </p><p>that reach 93, 85, and 83 percent in municipal populations </p><p>in Latin America, Africa, and Asia, respectively. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. SUPPLY IN THE SOUTHEAST. The Southeastern Anatolia </p><p>Project (GAP) plans to complete its regional municipal water </p><p>network by 2010.  As of 1999, 42 percent of the region\'s </p><p>municipalities had water networks, 28 percent had networks </p><p>under construction and 30 percent had no connection to water </p><p>supply systems.  In provinces further east -- Agri, Hakkari </p><p>and Siirt -- the fewest number of villages have water supply </p><p>systems. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. DSI subsidizes municipalities by providing water </p><p>infrastructure.  Municipalities set their own water pricing </p><p>policies, with schemes varying from city to city. Among </p><p>samples studied, Istanbul\'s household water per m3 appears </p><p>to be most costly ($.73 - 2.56) and Kaseri\'s in Central </p><p>Anatolia among the least ($.30 - .54). These figures do not </p><p>include 18 percent VAT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A View from the cities </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. Ankara:  Without additional facilities, Ankara is </p><p>projected to face a water shortage in 2007. The city uses </p><p>only two thirds of its stored water due to insufficient </p><p>pipelines capacity. The much-needed Isikli project, which </p><p>would provide sufficient water through 2027, is currently </p><p>unfunded. The U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA) funded </p><p>a feasibility study on water loss management, but the </p><p>project went unfunded. TDA also provided funding for water </p><p>system feasibility studies in the three cities below. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. Istanbul:  A rapid population increase and an aging </p><p>water system that leaks 50 percent of its contents has </p><p>challenged Istanbul\'s municipal water resources. To meet its </p><p>water needs through 2040, Istanbul will undertake two major </p><p>water projects funded by the Japanese International </p><p>Cooperation Agency, including the dramatic Melen project </p><p>that will construct large pipelines under the Bosphorus and </p><p>build the largest water treatment plant in Europe. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. Antalya: During tourist season, the population of this </p><p>Mediterranean resort surges 73 percent.  In 2004, Antalya </p><p>will begin the second phase of a $535 million-project that </p><p>should meet the city\'s potable water supply and wastewater </p><p>requirements until 2020. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. Izmir: The recently constructed $120 million Tahtali Dam </p><p>will provide Izmir with sufficient water storage, treatment </p><p>and transportation for decades. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Institutional challenges </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. The General Directorate of State Hydraulic Works (DSI) </p><p>was established in 1953 within MOENR as the primary </p><p>executive state agency responsible for national water </p><p>resource planning, management and execution. Although </p><p>employing the best of Turkey\'s hydrologists, it is </p><p>criticized for failing to bring in "young blood" and for </p><p>being tight-fisted with information. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14.  Discussions with water professionals have identified </p><p>three challenges facing Turkey\'s water institutions: lack of </p><p>institutional coordination, lack of data sharing, and under- </p><p>trained professionals. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- In theory, only four government agencies have decision- </p><p>making authority in national water policy.  Unofficial </p><p>counts tally up to seven ministries and 18 general </p><p>directorates, plus 81 provincial governates with water </p><p>responsibilities and dozens of Water Users Associations that </p><p>manage 80 percent of irrigation water. One hydrology </p><p>professor called this cacophony "an appalling abdication of </p><p>responsibility" of the state.  However, an Ministry of </p><p>Environment official projected that about 80 percent of </p><p>these overlaps would be resolved in legislation submitted to </p><p>parliament on 1/8/03. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Data sharing is nearly non-existent.  Many government </p><p>agencies, consultants and researchers monitor water quality. </p><p>Each measures different parameters for different reasons. </p><p>Several unsuccessful attempts have been made to create a </p><p>national data bank. According to a former DSI Director </p><p>General, Turkey is "not even close" to establishing a </p><p>national water database because the under-funded agencies </p><p>compete rather than cooperate. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Professional skills need strengthening.  With </p><p>insufficient expertise available, many technical projects </p><p>completed in the 1970s (groundwater modeling programs, river </p><p>basin reports), have sat idle or without updates.  Newly </p><p>developed models become academic exercises with no follow- </p><p>up.  Often, outside consultants do work that should be done </p><p>in-house.  Alternately, work simply does not get done. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Some threats to water quality and supply </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15. The greatest threat to Turkey\'s fresh water is </p><p>inadequate waste management infrastructure.  Only 13 percent </p><p>of municipal waste is disposed of in sanitary landfills (Ref </p><p>A).  The rest is dumped without treatment in rivers and open </p><p>pits. Across Turkey, gas stations flush their tanks directly </p><p>into groundwater sources.  Many wastewater treatment plants </p><p>are poorly run.  A former DSI scientist told us of one plant </p><p>where water was more contaminated after treatment than </p><p>before. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16. Deforestation and erosion affect water resources. </p><p>Without healthy root systems to cling to soil, rainwater and </p><p>snowmelts run uncontrolled and cannot be captured.  More </p><p>than 75 percent of Turkey\'s land is prone to erosion and </p><p>forested areas have diminished 0.22 percent in the past </p><p>decade (20,000 ha per year). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>17.  An insufficient understanding of water-use principles </p><p>at the user level threatens water supply, particularly in </p><p>agricultural areas of the southeast.  Farmers with newly </p><p>installed irrigation systems frequently over-irrigate, </p><p>leading to salt-intrusion (salination) and water-rise </p><p>problems across broad geographic areas. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Groundwater contamination threatens health </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>18.  Insufficient enforcement of environmental laws and </p><p>water regulations, a lack of public awareness, a lack of </p><p>political will and a technical inability to match </p><p>contaminants with sources compound groundwater problems. </p><p>Industrial waste, agricultural run-off and other elements </p><p>are allowed to degrade groundwater quality.  In addition to </p><p>negatively affecting public health, this reduces crop </p><p>yields, freshwater biodiversity and quantities of freshwater </p><p>fish catches, and increases eutrophication and costs to </p><p>reduce pollution levels. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>19.  Turkey\'s National Environmental Action Plan lists one </p><p>of the three most important domestic water resources (the </p><p>Sakarya Basin in central Anatolia) among the most polluted. </p><p>The most polluted basins and lakes are concentrated in the </p><p>industrialized western region, with only Lake Van in eastern </p><p>Anatolia considered "at risk," this due to sewage discharge, </p><p>industrial wastewater, and agricultural run-off. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>20. Scientific studies brim with examples of groundwater </p><p>contamination that outpaces enforcement of the "polluter </p><p>pays" principal in environmental law. Many industries are </p><p>identified as heavy polluters -- textile industry, sugar </p><p>beet plants, paper factories, alkaloid companies.  Many </p><p>communities fight contamination -- Hatay (organic, inorganic </p><p>pollutants), Mersin (heavy industrial pollutants), Adana </p><p>(agricultural run-off), and Kemalpasa (cyanide). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>21. The former Director General acknowledges that water </p><p>quality is not well monitored due to economic constraints. </p><p>These constraints also affect DSI\'s laboratory capacity, </p><p>forcing Turkey to send samples to Canada to assure reliable </p><p>assessments. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>22. Turkey has made the best of a dry situation, but it </p><p>needs to clarify its water management further, strengthen </p><p>the professional capacity of its technicians, enhance its </p><p>public education efforts, and establish a national database. </p><p>Meeting the needs of a growing population will require </p><p>substantial investment in infrastructure and continual </p><p>institutional vigilance. </p><p></p></div>
