(SBU) SUMMARY: FODAG HAS LEARNED FROM THE WORLD FOOD </p><p>PROGRAM (PLEASE PROTECT) THAT THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL HAS </p><p>ASKED HIS UNDER-SECRETARY GENERAL FOR HUMANITARIAN AFFAIRS </p><p>TO "TAKE THE LEAD IN FACILITATING THE DEVELOPMENT AND </p><p>ARTICULATION OF A COHERENT SYSTEM-WIDE POSITION ON THE ISSUE </p><p>OF IMPORTATION OF FOOD AID CONTAINING GENETICALLY MODIFIED </p><p>ORGANISMS."  WE BELIEVE THAT A MORE APPROPRIATE ROLE FOR THE </p><p>UN WOULD BE TO FACILITATE THE PROVISION OF INFORMATION TO </p><p>COUNTRIES CONCERNING CURRENT NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL </p><p>POLICIES.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  THE WORLD FOOD PROGRAM (PLEASE PROTECT) PROVIDED </p><p>FODAG WITH CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN THE UN UNDERSECRETARY </p><p>GENERAL FOR HUMANITARIAN AFFAIRS AND THE HEADS OF THE ROME </p><p>FOOD AGENCIES IN WHICH UNDERSECRETARY OSHIMA STATES THAT THE </p><p>UN SECRETARY GENERAL, "CONCERNED BY THE HUMANITARIAN </p><p>SITUATION IN ZIMBABWE, AND PARTICULARLY THE CONCERNS </p><p>EXPRESSED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE ABOUT THE </p><p>IMPORTATION OF FOOD AID CONTAINING GENETICALLY MODIFIED </p><p>ORGANISMS," HAS ASKED UNDERSECRETARY OSHIMA TO "TAKE THE </p><p>LEAD IN FACILITATING THE DEVELOPMENT AND ARTICULATION OF A </p><p>COHERENT SYSTEM-WIDE POSITION ON THE ISSUE OF IMPORTATION OF </p><p>FOOD AID CONTAINING GENETICALLY MODIFIED ORGANISMS." </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  03508  01 OF 02  161859Z </p><p>(CORRESPONDENCE FAXED TO IO/EDA 7/10/02). </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) THE ROME UN BODIES  WITH RELEVANT POLICIES ARE:  THE </p><p>UN FOOD AND AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATION\'S (FAO) CODEX </p><p>ALIMENTARIUS COMMISSION (IS IT SAFE TO EAT?) AND THE WFP </p><p>(CAN IT BE USED AS FOOD AID?).  WE DO NOT KNOW IF </p><p>UNDERSECRETARY OSHIMA HAS QUERIED OTHER UN BODIES. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) THE WFP RESPONSE TO OSHIMA\'S REQUEST STATES THAT </p><p>WFP ACCEPTS ONLY FOOD AID WHICH MEETS FOOD SAFETY </p><p>REGULATIONS OF THE DONOR AND RECIPIENT COUNTRY AND WHICH </p><p>MEETS CODEX STANDARDS. THE LETTER FURTHER STATES THAT "IT IS </p><p>PROBABLY NOT A GOOD IDEA FOR A NONTECHNICAL BODY LIKE OCHA </p><p>TO GET INVOLVED IN SETTING POLICY IN THIS AREA, OR WE COULD </p><p>SOON BE AT ODDS WITH WTO, THE CODEX ALIMENTARIUS AND MAJOR </p><p>DONORS." </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) THE FAO RESPONSE NOTES THAT NATIONAL POLICIES </p><p>DIFFER ON THE SUBJECT, BUT STATES THAT THE FAO\'S "POSITION" </p><p>IS THAT THE CARTAGENA PROTOCOL SHOULD BE FOLLOWED ON THE </p><p>QUESTION OF ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY. (COMMENT: HOWEVER, THE FAO </p><p>RESPONSE INCORRECTLY CHARACTERIZES SEVERAL ASPECTS OF THE </p><p>REQUIREMENTS OF THE CARTAGENA PROTOCOL, INCLUDING IMPLYING </p><p>THAT THE ADVANCE INFORMED AGREEMENT PROVISIONS FOR LIVING </p><p>MODIFIED ORGANISMS FOR INTENTIONAL INTRODUCTION INTO THE </p><p>ENVIRONMENT WOULD APPLY TO FOOD AND STATING THAT THE </p><p>PROTOCOL STIPULATES THAT GRAIN SHIPMENTS SHOULD BE MILLED TO </p><p>ENSURE GRAIN FOR FOOD WILL NOT BE PLANTED. END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) CONCERNING FOOD SAFETY, THE FAO RESPONSE REFERS TO </p><p>THE SCIENCE-BASED STANDARDS OF THE FAO/WHO CODEX </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  03508  01 OF 02  161859Z </p><p>ALIMENTARIUS COMMISSION AND NOTES THAT THE CODEX AD HOC </p><p>INTERGOVERNMENTAL TASK FORCE ON FOODS DERIVED FROM </p><p>BIOTECHNOLOGY HAS DEVELOPED PRINCIPLES FOR THE SAFETY </p><p>ASSESSMENT OF FOODS DERIVED FROM GENETICALLY MODIFIED </p><p>SOURCES AND GUIDELINES FOR SAFETY ASSESSMENTS OF FOODS </p><p>DERIVED FROM GENETICALLY MODIFIED PLANTS.  (COMMENT:  THE </p><p>FAO RESPONSE DOES NOT MENTION THAT CODEX DOES NOT REQUIRE </p><p>LABELING FOR GMO PRODUCTS.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) THE FAO RESPONSE CONCLUDES: "FAO BELIEVES THAT </p><p>GOVERNMENTS MUST CONSIDER THE CONSEQUENCES OF STARVATION AND </p><p>MALNUTRITION FOR THE HEALTH OF THEIR POPULATIONS...AND </p><p>WHETHER THESE OUTWEIGH THE REMOTE POSSIBILITY OF INCREASED </p><p>RISKS TO HUMAN HEALTH FROM CONSUMING FOODS DERIVED FROM </p><p>MODERN BIOTECHNOLOGY AND THE ADDITIONAL RISK TO THE </p><p>ENVIRONMENT." </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7.
