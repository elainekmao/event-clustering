<p>S E C R E T AMMAN 000150 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/08/2013 </p><p>TAGS: SNAR, PTER, KCRM, PREL, JO, NL </p><p>SUBJECT: MULLAH KREKAR EXTRADITION: JORDANIANS THINK THE </p><p>DUTCH ARE ASKING FOR THE IMPOSSIBLE </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) THE HAGUE 27 (B) 12/30-12/31 BERRY-RUSSEL </p><p>     E-MAILS </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edward W. Gnehm.  Reasons 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (S) Post shares Embassy The Hague\'s frustration with the </p><p>current state of play of the Mullah Krekar extradition case. </p><p>To have Krekar walk free would be an outcome that would serve </p><p>no one\'s interests and would send the wrong signal to all </p><p>those working tirelessly in the fight against terrorism </p><p>around the world.  In the last week, the Ambassador has </p><p>talked with the Foreign Minister about the case, the DCM with </p><p>the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, and other </p><p>appropriate officers with GOJ counterparts. </p><p> </p><p>2. (S/NF) Based on those multiple discussions and many </p><p>previous contacts over the past several weeks, we have a </p><p>different perspective from that in reftel on where the </p><p>problem lies and what needs to be done to address it.  The </p><p>bottom line is that GOJ -- and the GID in particular -- has </p><p>little confidence that anything they can provide the GONL </p><p>will be sufficient to satisfy Dutch legal requirements.  Both </p><p>the Dutch reaction to the Jordanians\' original efforts to get </p><p>Krekar extradited on assassination charges, and the recent </p><p>outcome of the Courtallier case (ref b) have solidified their </p><p>thinking on this.  Moreover, there is a real cost to the </p><p>Jordanians in providing detailed intelligence information </p><p>which will become public in a court hearing. </p><p> </p><p>3. (S/NF) In the first instance, the Dutch refused to </p><p>consider a Jordanian extradition request based on a valid </p><p>Interpol arrest warrant because the charge in question was </p><p>attempted assassination -- a crime which we understand the </p><p>Dutch system does not recognize as a basis for extradition. </p><p>Then, with the Courtallier case, the Dutch court ruled that </p><p>information gathered through intelligence channels does not </p><p>constitute a suitable basis for extradition.  As the Krekar </p><p>case is -- like Courtallier -- based on intel, the GID sees </p><p>the writing on the wall and believes that there is little to </p><p>be gained by providing the Dutch with yet more information </p><p>that once in the public domain would jeopardize sources and </p><p>methods.  The end result, they believe, will be the same -- a </p><p>Dutch court will refuse to extradite Krekar. </p><p> </p><p>4. (S) In our view the current dilemma springs not from some </p><p>sort of uncharacteristic recalcitrance on the Jordanians\' </p><p>part (although we agree that they could have been much more </p><p>transparent in presenting their concerns to us at an earlier </p><p>stage of the process), but rather with the standards of </p><p>evidence required by Dutch courts.  The Jordanians </p><p>conscientiously have taken steps to address Dutch concerns </p><p>(providing written assurances that Krekar would only be tried </p><p>on the drug trafficking charges and, if convicted, would not </p><p>face the death penalty).  They tell us they have provided the </p><p>evidence available to them short of compromising sources and </p><p>methods.  However, neither our Jordanian counterparts nor we </p><p>can see how they can meet Dutch requirements in a case </p><p>clearly based on sensitive intelligence information. </p><p> </p><p>5. (S)  As we are not familiar with Dutch law we can not </p><p>offer suggestions as to whether there are unexplored avenues </p><p>to deal with the case in Dutch courts.  We would welcome </p><p>Embassy Oslo\'s comments on the likely outcome if Krekar is </p><p>expelled from the Netherlands to Norway, as presently seems </p><p>likely.  Recommendations from the Department on legal aspects </p><p>of the case would also be most welcome. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Note: For the record, we note that the Dutch are </p><p>mistaken if they believe a Jordanian security court has </p><p>overridden the civilian courts on the matter of Ra\'ed </p><p>Hijazi\'s appeal of his death sentence (ref A).  The issue </p><p>will ultimately be decided by the Court of Cassation, not by </p><p>the Security Court. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
