<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L MOSCOW 037083 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, PGOV, US, UR </p><p>SUBJECT:  GEORGIA -- DELIVERY OF LETTER ON </p><p>RECOGNITION, COMMENTS ON INTERNAL SITUATION </p><p> </p><p>REF:  STATE 418469 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  DEPUTY POLITICAL COUNSELOR DELIVERED </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL LETTER RECOGNIZING THE INDEPENDENCE OF </p><p>GEORGIA TO GEORGIAN REPRESENTATIVE IN MOSCOW PYOTR </p><p>PETROVICH CHIKMEIDZE ON FRIDAY, DECEMBER 27.  SHE ALSO </p><p>EXPLAINED THE PRINCIPLES ON WHICH DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS </p><p>WILL BE ESTABLISHED, AND EXPRESSED U.S. DESIRE TO </p><p>CONTINUE AN ACTIVE DIALOGUE WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF </p><p>GEORGIA AND TO SUSTAIN CONTACTS THROUGH THE U.S. </p><p>EMBASSY IN MOSCOW. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  CHIKMEIDZE EXPRESSED APPRECIATION FOR THE </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL LETTER, THEN EXPRESSED POLITE DISMAY THAT </p><p>DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS REMAINED AT ISSUE.  "THINGS ARE </p><p>VERY DIFFICULT AND COMPLICATED FOR US.  WE HAVE MADE </p><p>MANY MISTAKES, BUT IT WOULD BE BETTER IF WE TALK TO </p><p>EACH OTHER, IF YOU WOULD MAKE YOUR POINTS DIRECTLY TO </p><p>US, RATHER THAN SCOLDING US FROM A DISTANCE," HE </p><p>SAID.  HE ASSERTED GEORGIAN RESPECT FOR DEMOCRACY </p><p>AND FOR THE VALUES REPRESENTED SPECIFICALLY BY </p><p>AMERICAN DEMOCRACY, AND APPEALED FOR U.S. HELP AND </p><p>COOPERATION. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  TURNING TO THE CURRENT SITUATION IN TBILISI, </p><p>CHIKMEIDZE CRITICIZED THE OPPOSITION FOR "STRUGGLING </p><p>FOR DEMOCRACY WITH MACHINE GUNS."  AT THE SAME TIME, </p><p>HE VOLUNTEERED THAT GAMSAKHURDIYA HAD MADE MANY </p><p>MISTAKES, AND IMPLIED PERSONAL DOUBT AS TO WHETHER </p><p>GAMSAKHURDIYA SHOULD ATTEMPT TO STAY ON.  ACCORDING TO </p><p>CHIKMEIDZE, GAMSAKHURDIYA HAD BEEN OFFERED SAFE </p><p>PASSAGE OUT OF THE COUNTRY EARLIER THIS WEEK, AND HAD </p><p>INITIALLY AGREED TO THIS.  HIS ADVISORS, HOWEVER, WHOM </p><p>CHIKMEIDZE DESCIBED AS "THE WOMEN AROUND HIM," OPPOSED </p><p>THIS, AND CONVINCED HIM OUT OF IT.  CHIKMEIDZE ALSO </p><p>POINTED OUT THAT THERE ARE TUNNELS LEADING FROM THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT BUILDING INTO THE HILLS SURROUNDING THE </p><p>CITY;  HE ASSUMES THAT THE OPPOSITION IS ALSO AWARE OF </p><p>THESE POTENTIAL ACCESS/ESCAPE ROUTES. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  ACCORDING TO CHIKMEIDZE, THE ARMED OPPOSITION </p><p>STORMED THE FORMER KGB PRISON IN TBILISI AND HAS FREED </p><p>OPPOSITION FIGURES CHANTURIYA AND YOSELYANI, AMONG </p><p>OTHERS. (THIS HAS SINCE BEEN CONFIRMED BY THE MEDIA.) </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  CONCERNING GEORGIA\'S POSSIBLE PLACE IN THE </p><p>COMMONWEALTH, CHIKMEIDZE SAID THAT GAMSAKHURDIYA </p><p>FAVORS GEORGIAN MEMBERSHIP IN THE COMMONWEALTH, AND </p><p>THAT IF HE SURVIVES THE CURRENT STRUGGLE GEORGIA WILL </p><p>JOIN THE COMMONWEALTH.  MANY OTHERS OPPOSE THIS MOVE, </p><p>HOWEVER, ARGUING THAT THE COMMONWEALTH WILL NOT WORK </p><p>AND THEY DO NOT WISH TO GET INVOLVED IN A FAILING </p><p>EFFORT.  PROPONENTS OF THIS VIEW ACCOUNTED FOR </p><p>GEORGIA\'S POSITION AT THE ALMA-ATA MEETING. </p><p>NONETHELESS, CHIKMEIDZE SUPPORTED INVOLVEMENT IN THE </p><p>COMMONWEALTH FOR WHAT BENEFITS MIGHT COME OF IT, AND </p><p>EXPECTS THAT GEORGIA WILL EVENTUALLY JOIN THE GROUPING </p><p>REGARDLESS OF THE OUTCOME OF THE CURRENT POWER </p><p>STRUGGLE IN TBILISI. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>COLLINS </p><p></p></div>
