On November 13 - 15 together with UN Senior Humanitarian </p><p>Affairs Officer, Andrew Timpson, Poloff visited ex-commercial </p><p>farm workers and their families in Tete province, Mozambique, </p><p>northern Mashonaland Central province in Zimbabwe, and on a </p><p>commercial farm near Harare.  The lack of food security in </p><p>all three locations merits food assistance.  Although the </p><p>reception for ex-workers in Mozambique seemed to be friendly, </p><p>those remaining in Zimbabwe live in fear and are trying to </p><p>stay out of sight, complicating the relief response effort. </p><p>End Summary </p><p> </p><p>Displaced in Mozambique </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>2. Poloff interviewed about fifteen ex-commercial farm </p><p>workers in the Mozambican towns Chikafa and Goho who reported </p><p>that they knew of about sixty ex-farm worker families (about </p><p>300 people) who had moved into those areas since September </p><p>2002, and that more were arriving daily.  Justice for </p><p>Agriculture (JAG), a Zimbabwe-based commercial agriculture </p><p>advocacy organization, estimates that about 900 ex-commercial </p><p>farm worker families, or about 4,500 people, have already </p><p>moved into Tete province. </p><p> </p><p>3. All of the ex-commercial farm workers interviewed in Tete </p><p>were born in other parts of Mozambique (none were from the </p><p>Chikafa / Goho area), but had moved to live and work on </p><p>commercial farms in Zimbabwe from between 1958 and 1986.  All </p><p>had Zimbabwean identity cards, had voted in recent elections </p><p>in Zimbabwe, and most said they had Zimbabwean-born wives and </p><p>children (now with them in Mozambique).  All said war </p><p>veterans forced them out of their residences on commercial </p><p>farms, mostly in Guruve district, Mashonaland Central </p><p>province, and told them to "go back where they came from". </p><p>They said they heard rumors that village heads in Mozambique </p><p>were granting land, so they hired private trucks to ferry </p><p>them into the area. </p><p> </p><p>4. All the ex-workers had been granted twelve acres which </p><p>they had cleared, erected traditional round mud-brick African </p><p>huts with grass thatch roofs, and planted cotton, maize and </p><p>tobacco.  (Note: Poor soil quality, and insufficient rainfall </p><p>result in low agricultural productivity in the area off the </p><p>Zimbabwean escarpment on both sides of the border.  End </p><p>Note.)  Many had done day labor for their new neighbors, and </p><p>community work for a food-for-work program with </p><p>WFP-Mozambique, but, the expected WFP food delivery was </p><p>already three weeks behind schedule.  In Chikafa, there was </p><p>no electricity, no phone anywhere in the area, no running </p><p>water, no paved roads, and no school.  The nearest health </p><p>clinic and school were on the Zimbabwean side.  The nearest </p><p>school in Mozambique was about twenty kilometers north.  They </p><p>said they used their severance packages, anywhere between </p><p>ZWD$150,000 and ZWD$340,000 (about US$88 - 200), to finance </p><p>their transport, seeds and food, but all said those funds </p><p>were essentially exhausted.  Their clothing was in average </p><p>condition, and most of our interlocutors appeared thinner </p><p>than average, but not wasting.  They reported that they </p><p>bought basic foodstuffs and supplies on the Zimbabwean side </p><p>with severance money, but these were sometimes confiscated by </p><p>Zimbabwean police on the walk back to Mozambique.  (Note: </p><p>When asked, the Zimbabwean police justified these </p><p>confiscations as an attempt to combat smuggling, and insisted </p><p>that only very small, personal amounts of foodstuffs could be </p><p>exported.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>5. Although our interlocutors said they were hungry, and that </p><p>there was hunger in this area, they said the people in </p><p>Mozambique were friendly.  Some said they could send their </p><p>children to school on the Zimbabwean side (which has </p><p>instruction in Shona and English), if they had the school </p><p>fees.  Others said they would try to send theirs to the </p><p>Mozambican school (where instruction is in Shona and </p><p>Portuguese).  The interviews were conducted in Shona; no </p><p>ex-commercial farm workers spoke fluent English or </p><p>Portuguese.  They seemed comfortable with their </p><p>circumstances, and expressed disinterest in moving elsewhere. </p><p> They described their exodus and current hunger with a tinge </p><p>of sadness, and seemed bitter at being forced out of </p><p>Zimbabwe.  Due to that experience, and political tension, </p><p>they said they would never move back to Zimbabwe even if jobs </p><p>became available. </p><p> </p><p>Displaced in Zimbabwe </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>6. Although WFP reports that as many as 1000 ex-commercial </p><p>farm worker families are already displaced in Mashonaland </p><p>Central province (Ref C), near the border with Mozambique, </p><p>and interviews were scheduled with dozens, Poloff was only </p><p>able to interview two.  The others reportedly feared </p><p>reprisals by war veterans for talking to international </p><p>officials, and stayed away.  The two interviewed had been </p><p>forced off a commercial farm near Guruve having received no </p><p>severance packages, traveled by public bus to Chikafa (on the </p><p>Zimbabwean side) and been allotted twelve acres under similar </p><p>circumstances described above. </p><p> </p><p>7. They were born in Zimbabwe of Zimbabwean parents and had </p><p>first tried to move back to their ancestral communal area in </p><p>September, but were rejected by the community who said that </p><p>as ex-commercial farm workers, and suspected MDC supporters, </p><p>they could not accept them.  Although the village head in </p><p>Chikafa had allotted them land, they could not buy maize or </p><p>seed from the local Grain Marketing Board (GMB) depot, and </p><p>reported a generally unfriendly and threatening reception by </p><p>fellow Zimbabweans.  They said they had been eating forest </p><p>fruit primarily these days.  Their compounds were mud-brick </p><p>and thatch dwellings, and they seemed to be in the same </p><p>physical condition as ex-workers in Mozambique--thinner than </p><p>average, but not wasting. </p><p> </p><p>Eating Termites and Forest Fruit </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>8. On November 15, Poloff interviewed about fifteen </p><p>ex-commercial farm workers on the Thanner farm in Melfort </p><p>(about 25 kilometers southeast of Harare) who were eating </p><p>dried termites and unripe forest fruit to survive.  (Note: </p><p>Although dried caterpillars can be found in street markets in </p><p>Zimbabwe and are occasionally eaten in a fried sauce over </p><p>maize meal, these are not considered a staple.  End Note.) </p><p>The ex-workers laid out mats on the ground and were drying </p><p>what appeared to be a few kilos of termites in the sun, some </p><p>with wings still on, others de-winged and ready for </p><p>consumption.  During the interview, children were gnawing on </p><p>small green forest fruit; the workers reported that these </p><p>were the only food they had been eating in recent days.  They </p><p>reported that they were not prevented from buying maize at a </p><p>nearby GMB depot for political reasons, but rather, could not </p><p>because they simply didn\'t have the money. </p><p> </p><p>9. There had originally been about 120 farm worker families </p><p>at the Thanner farm; twenty had already left.  Those </p><p>remaining were living in their original dwellings, simple </p><p>mud-brick and tin roof huts with no electricity.  Some were </p><p>working two days a week for ZWD$290 per day (about US$0.17) </p><p>for the new settlers who had divided the farm into sixteen </p><p>individual plots.  The ex-workers had only small vegetable </p><p>garden-sized plots around their houses, far too small to </p><p>support the annual food needs of a whole family, and no maize </p><p>seed.  Six of the settlers, mostly civil servants living and </p><p>working in Harare, had started to farm their 50 - 160 acre </p><p>plots, but ten had never visited the location.  The </p><p>ex-workers appeared to be in similar physical condition as </p><p>their compatriots elsewhere--thin, but not wasting.  They </p><p>complained of hunger and asked Poloff and his companions for </p><p>food assistance.  Five to seven war veterans arrived from a </p><p>nearby farm, and violently halted the interview beating the </p><p>other members of Poloff\'s party, one severely (Ref A). </p><p> </p><p>Comment: </p><p>-------- </p><p>10. This is the first in a series of reports to characterize </p><p>the situation for IDPs.  Due to time constraints, Poloff was </p><p>unable to confirm the total numbers of ex-commercial farm </p><p>workers recently resettled in the Tete province of </p><p>Mozambique.  Based on the density of villages just across the </p><p>border it could easily number into the hundreds of families, </p><p>possibly even the JAG reported figure of 900 (4,500 people). </p><p>Due to effective intimidation, Poloff was unable to confirm </p><p>the plethora of independent reports suggesting that thousands </p><p>of families have already moved to other locations within </p><p>Zimbabwe.  (Note: We have no reason to doubt this estimate </p><p>and the likelihood that it is increasing.  End Note.)  No one </p><p>whom Poloff interviewed had been transported by GOZ vehicle, </p><p>or involuntarily, though all said they had been "forced" off </p><p>the commercial farms. </p><p> </p><p>11. Although the environment in Mozambique was friendly, it </p><p>did not seem to be easy.  There was little infrastructure, </p><p>and people seemed tired of all the work involved in moving, </p><p>building a house, and planting on meager nutrition.  They </p><p>moved and spoke lethargically.  They were not dying on their </p><p>feet, but without some food assistance in the coming months, </p><p>their plights will become dire. </p><p> </p><p>12. The situation for ex-workers in Dande (northern Zimbabwe) </p><p>was worse.  They had huts, compounds, and farmland, but could </p><p>not buy maize or seed from the GMB, and in the politically </p><p>threatening environment could not rely on anyone to help. </p><p>With meager resources at present, their need for food </p><p>assistance seems more acute, and without seed this year, more </p><p>prolonged. </p><p> </p><p>13. The situation for ex-workers in Melfort was also very </p><p>bad.  Their biggest problem seemed to be that they didn\'t </p><p>have enough land on which to grow their own food.  Working </p><p>for US$0.34 a week was simply not enough to cover their </p><p>family food needs.  They need food assistance, but, as Poloff </p><p>and his party experienced, war veterans controlled the farm </p><p>completely.  It would seem difficult to design a feeding </p><p>program which did not account for the war veterans\' control. </p><p> </p><p>14. The fear demonstrated by ex-workers who failed to appear </p><p>for interviews with us, and the desperation and tension </p><p>experienced on the Thanner farm suggest that the situation is </p><p>bad for any ex-commercial farm worker in Zimbabwe.  This fear </p><p>complicates response planning, as it appears ex-workers would </p><p>rather remain unseen than identify themselves for </p><p>international assistance, and the unwanted attentions of </p><p>neighboring ZANU-PF zealots.
