<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HO CHI MINH CITY 001221 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>USDOC FOR 3132/OIO/EAP/KELLEHER </p><p>USDOC FOR 1431/MAC/AP/HPPHO </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, ETRD, VN, BTA </p><p>SUBJECT: VIETRADE HCMC CLAIMS SEPTEMBER 11 EVENTS HURT VIETNAM EXPORTS, WORRIES ABOUT VN COMPANIES IN US MARKET </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HO CHI  01221  01 OF 02  290950Z </p><p>1.  IN AN OCTOBER 26 MEETING, VIETRADE HCMC DIRECTOR </p><p>CITES DAMAGE FROM THE EVENTS OF SEPTEMBER 11 TO </p><p>VIETNAM\'S EXPORTS, NOTING THAT EXPORT GROWTH IS </p><p>ESTIMATED AT 7% THIS YEAR, A DRAMATIC FALL FROM LAST </p><p>YEAR\'S 30% INCREASE.  ALTHOUGH LAUDING PASSAGE OF THE </p><p>BTA, HE STATED THAT VIETNAMESE COMPANIES NEED MUCH MORE </p><p>INFORMATION IF THEY WERE TO EXPAND INTO THE U.S. </p><p>MARKET.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>EXPORTS HURT BY OSAMA BIN LADEN </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>2.  IN A MEETING WITH DPO AND ECONOFF, MR. VO TA LUONG, </p><p>THE DIRECTOR OF THE VIETNAM TRADE PROMOTION AGENCY FOR </p><p>SOUTHERN VIETNAM, STATED THAT THE EVENTS OF SEPTEMBER </p><p>11 HAD AN INDIRECT BUT DAMAGING IMPACT ON VIETNAM\'S </p><p>EXPORTS.  HE STATED THAT ALTHOUGH VIETNAM EXPORTED </p><p>RELATIVELY LITTLE TO THE U.S., SHIPMENTS TO OTHER MAJOR </p><p>MARKETS HAD BEEN AFFECTED.  HE NOTED THAT NATIONAL </p><p>EXPORT GROWTH, WHICH HAD BEEN TARGETED AT 16% FOR THE </p><p>YEAR, HAD, UNTIL A FEW WEEKS AGO, BEEN ESTIMATED AT </p><p>10%.  NOW IT IS EXPECTED TO BE A MERE 7%.  THIS </p><p>COMPARES TO LAST YEAR\'S GROWTH RATE OF 30%.  ALTHOUGH </p><p>SOME OF THIS DROP CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE OVERALL </p><p>SLOWDOWN IN THE WORLD ECONOMY, HE STATED THAT THE </p><p>EVENTS OF SEPTEMBER 11, AND INCREASED SECURITY WORRIES </p><p>WORLDWIDE, HAD CLEARLY MADE LIFE MORE DIFFICULT FOR </p><p>VIETNAMESE EXPORTERS IN THE SOUTH. </p><p> </p><p>3.  MR. LUONG\'S VIEW CORRESPONDS TO COMMENTS FROM OTHER </p><p>OFFICIALS AND BUSINESS PEOPLE IN HCMC WHO NOTE THAT THE </p><p>NUMBER OF TRAVELERS, TRADE MISSIONS, AND NEW BUSINESS </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HO CHI  01221  01 OF 02  290950Z </p><p>INITIATIVES IN THE HCMC AREA HAVE FALLEN NOTICEABLY </p><p>OVER THE PAST FEW WEEKS.  ALTHOUGH VIETNAM IS CURRENTLY </p><p>TRUMPETING ITS RATING FROM THE POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC </p><p>RISK CONSULTANCY AS THE SAFEST PLACE TO DO BUSINESS IN </p><p>ASIA (BASED ON A SURVEY CONDUCTED IN THE WAKE OF THE </p><p>TERRORIST ACTS), THE EVENTS OF SEPTEMBER 11 HAVE </p><p>CLEARLY HAD A NEGATIVE IMPACT HERE, AND LOCAL OFFICIALS </p><p>AND BUSINESS PEOPLE KNOW IT. </p><p> </p><p>VIETRADE PROMOTES EXPORT AND INVESTMENT </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>4.   THE VIETNAM TRADE PROMOTION AGENCY (VIETRADE) IS </p><p>ONLY ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF OLD. THE HO CHI MINH CITY </p><p>OFFICE HAS A STAFF OF 10 PEOPLE AND IS RESPONSIBLE FOR </p><p>MOST OF THE SOUTHERN REGION OF VIETNAM.  PART OF THE </p><p>MINISTRY OF TRADE, IT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR STATE </p><p>MANAGEMENT, COORDINATION, AND IMPLEMENTATION OF TRADE </p><p>AND TRADE-RELATED INVESTMENT PROMOTION ACTIVITIES IN </p><p>VIETNAM.  VIETRADE ORGANIZES SEMINARS, TRADE MISSIONS, </p><p>AND ALL ASPECTS OF TRADE PROMOTION.  UNLIKE BUSINESS </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS THAT FINANCE THROUGH FEE-BASED SERVICES </p><p>OR MEMBERSHIP DUES, VIETRADE IS FUNDED BY THE NATIONAL </p><p>BUDGET AND CAN DRAW UPON ITS BUDGET TO COVER THE COSTS </p><p>OF SOME OF ITS EVENTS OR SUBSIDIZE PARTICIPATION OF </p><p>VIETNAMESE COMPANIES. </p><p> </p><p>5. ITS WORK IS SIMILAR TO THE MYRIAD OF OTHER </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE SET UP IN VIETNAM TO PROMOTE </p><p>TRADE AND INVESTMENT FOR A PARTICULAR PROVINCE, CITY, </p><p>INDUSTRIAL OR EXPORT ZONE, OR AMONG MEMBER COMPANIES. </p><p>IT ALSO SERVES AS A GOVERNMENT-TO-GOVERNMENT CHANNEL </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HO CHI  01221  01 OF 02  290950Z </p><p>FOR FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS OR INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS </p><p>TO WORK WITH THE GVN ON TRADE PROMOTION ACTIVITIES. </p><p>FOR EXAMPLE, VIETRADE IS CURRENTLY WORKING WITH THE </p><p>UNDP AND AN AGENCY OF THE SWISS GOVERNMENT ON A THREE- </p><p>YEAR PROJECT ON DEVELOPING EXPORT MARKETS FOR SEAFOOD </p><p>AND FOOTWEAR.  IT HAS ALSO WORKED CLOSELY WITH THE </p><p>ASEAN-JAPAN CENTER, WHICH IS A JAPAN-FUNDED </p><p>ORGANIZATION TO ASSIST ASEAN NATIONS IN ENTERING THE </p><p>JAPAN MARKET. </p><p> </p><p>6.  VIETRADE ALSO SERVES AS AN INFORMATION RESOURCE </p><p>WHICH GATHERS TRADE INFORMATION FROM A VARIETY OF </p><p>SOURCES OVERSEAS AND IN VIETNAM.  LUONG NOTED TO </p><p>CONOFFS THAT HE WOULD BE HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP DIRECTLY </p><p>WITH ANY VIETNAMESE COMPANIES THAT CONOFFS ENCOUNTER </p><p>WITH QUESTIONS ABOUT EXPORTING. </p><p> </p><p>HOW DO WE EXPORT TO THE U.S.? </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>7.  LUONG STATED THAT WITH THE PASSAGE OF THE BTA THE </p><p>VIETNAMESE BUSINESS COMMUNITY IS VERY INTERESTED IN </p><p>INFORMATION AND ASSISTANCE ON HOW TO ENTER THE U.S. </p><p>MARKET.  HE NOTES THAT, IN PARTICULAR, SMALL COMPANIES </p><p>DO NOT HAVE THE EXPERTISE OR RESOURCES TO PARTICIPATE </p><p>IN WHAT HE CHARACTERIZED AS "DISTANT U.S. MARKETS." </p><p>CAN THE USG HELP? </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HO CHI  01221  02 OF 02  290950Z </p><p>----------------- </p><p>8.  HE ASKED IF THE USG WOULD BE ABLE TO PROVIDE </p><p>ASSISTANCE TO VIETNAMESE COMPANIES SEEKING TO ENTER THE </p><p>U.S. MARKET.  DPO ADVISED THAT WHILE THE USG IS </p><p>PLANNING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS FOR VIETNAM AND </p><p>DIRECTLY ASSISTS U.S. EXPORTERS SEEKING TO DO BUSINESS </p><p>WITH VIETNAM, THE GVN WOULD GENERALLY HAVE THE LEAD </p><p>ROLE IN ASSISTING VIETNAMESE BUSINESSES HOPING TO </p><p>EXPORT TO THE U.S.  AT THE SAME TIME, WE RECOGNIZE THE </p><p>IMPORTANCE OF LOCAL COMPANIES BENEFITING FROM THE BTA </p><p>AND A CLOSER U.S.-VIETNAM TRADE RELATIONSHIP.  IN THAT </p><p>SPIRIT WE SHOULD TRY TO FIND CREATIVE WAYS TO SHARE </p><p>INFORMATION, CONTACTS AND EXPERIENCE.  DPO POINTED TO </p><p>THE PAST EXAMPLE OF CONGEN AND VIETRADE ORGANIZING A </p><p>U.S. CUSTOMS SEMINAR WHICH INCLUDED PARTICIPATION OF </p><p>VIETNAMESE COMPANIES. </p><p> </p><p>BIO NOTE </p><p>-------- </p><p>9.  MR. LUONG HAS WORKED FOR THE MINISTRY OF TRADE </p><p>SINCE GRADUATING FROM UNIVERSITY IN MOSCOW IN 1980 WITH </p><p>A DEGREE IN ENGLISH AND ECONOMICS.  HE HAS SERVED IN </p><p>HCMC SINCE 1992 AND HAS HELD A LEADERSHIP POSITION FOR </p><p>THE PAST THREE YEARS.  HE HAS HEADED UP THE HO CHI MINH </p><p>CITY OFFICE OF VIETRADE SINCE IT WAS ESTABLISHED A YEAR </p><p>AND A HALF AGO.  HE CONCURRENTLY HOLDS THE TITLE OF </p><p>DEPUTY DIRECTOR GENERAL OF THE HCMC OFFICE OF THE </p><p>MINISTRY OF TRADE.  MR. LUONG SPEAKS CONVERSATIONAL </p><p>ENGLISH, AND EXCELLENT RUSSIAN.  HE HAS NEVER TRAVELED </p><p>TO THE U.S. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HO CHI  01221  02 OF 02  290950Z </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p>10.  ALTHOUGH VIETRADE SEEMS FOCUSED ON MAJOR PROJECTS </p><p>PARTNERING WITH FOREIGN FUNDERS, CONGEN WILL TRY TO </p><p>FIND CREATIVE WAYS TO WORK WITH THE ORGANIZATION TO </p><p>ENCOURAGE VIETNAMESE BUSINESS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE </p><p>BTA. HIS CONCERNS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT VIETNAMESE </p><p>COMPANIES ARE READY TO COMPETE IN THE U.S. MARKET IS AN </p><p>OFT HEARD REFRAIN HERE. </p><p> </p><p>YAMAUCHI </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
