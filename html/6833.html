<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 001971 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR PRM/ANE, EUR/SE AND NEA/NGA </p><p>DEPT PASS USAID FOR BHA/OFDA - WGARVELINK AND FFP </p><p>EUCOM FOR JE, JR, J5, SOJ7 AND POLAD </p><p>GENEVA FOR RMA </p><p>CENTCOM FOR J3, J5 AND POLAD </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/20/2013 </p><p>TAGS: EAID, IZ, PREF, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZ01:  MFA ON SOURCING AND TRANSIT OF FOOD FOR </p><p>IRAQ AND OTHER HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE ISSUES </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Deputy Chief of Mission Robert Deutsch for </p><p>reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Summary: </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Emboffs and Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) </p><p>Leader discussed humanitarian planning issues on March 26 </p><p>with Feza Ozturk, MFA Head of Department for International </p><p>Political Organizations.  In response to a looming shortage </p><p>of wheat flour in northern Iraq, the World Food Program has </p><p>applied to MFA for permission to send 6,000 tons of wheat </p><p>flour across the border.  Turkey will shortly approve release </p><p>of 50,000 tons of wheat flour from its strategic reserve for </p><p>humanitarian purposes.  Ozturk confirmed that internally </p><p>displaced persons (IDPs) had not sought refuge on Turkey,s </p><p>borders.  Ozturk expects in the next several days to initiate </p><p>the ad hoc humanitarian aid coordination group suggested by </p><p>A/S Dewey earlier this month.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>WFP Transit: </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Ozturk told us that John Murray, the UN World Food </p><p>Program Emergency Coordinator, had contacted him about </p><p>emerging food shortages in northern Iraq, which had not </p><p>received as great a level of advance rations as the center </p><p>and south prior to the conflict.  Turkey is prepared to </p><p>release 50,000 metric tons of wheat flour for Iraq from its </p><p>strategic reserve, which would then be replenished by WFP. </p><p>Ozturk stated that this would require Cabinet approval, </p><p>expected within days.  Turkey would do everything possible to </p><p>facilitate transportation of food relief to northern Iraq, </p><p>but Ozturk warned that there could be transport bottlenecks </p><p>slowing down the flow of aid.  He said the key problem is </p><p>security for Turkish drivers and equipment delivering food to </p><p>Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Murray told us later in the day that WFP was trying </p><p>to address a Kurdistan Democratic Party request for wheat </p><p>flour, and that he had formally requested MFA approval to </p><p>ship 6,000 tons to Erbil on an emergency basis.  He said WFP </p><p>had not addressed the security issue on the Iraqi side yet, </p><p>but guessed that KDP authorities would make the necessary </p><p>security arrangements. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Current Situation on the Border and in Northern Iraq: </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Ozturk confirmed that IDPs have not arrived at the </p><p>Turkish border.  Instead, IDPs appear to be headed for rural </p><p>areas, and particularly to higher elevations about 6 to 12 </p><p>hours from the border.  Turkey has not set up any camps and </p><p>will not do so until they are needed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Coordination Mechanism: </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Ozturk advised that the Turkish General Staff and </p><p>other agencies had approved the concept of MFA hosting an ad </p><p>hoc, civilian humanitarian assistance coordination meeting </p><p>with the UN agencies and Embassy representatives.  He told us </p><p>he could not call the first meeting until he received written </p><p>confirmation of the interagency decision, which he expected </p><p>in the next day or two.  Ozturk suggested the initial meeting </p><p>include MFA, Embassy and a UNHCR representative.  Mission </p><p>Disaster Relief Officer encouraged Ozturk to include a </p><p>broader group from the UN, and particularly WFP.  Ozturk said </p><p>he expected an interagency approval in the near future for </p><p>the U.S. request to site humanitarian daily rations in Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NGOs: </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) Ozturk stated that MFA was reviewing NGO applications </p><p>for work in Turkey as well as for transit of goods to Iraq on </p><p>an expedited basis.  He reiterated the GOT,s position that </p><p>NGOs would be permitted to cross the border to respond to </p><p>humanitarian needs, but that Turkey would consider carefully </p><p>how many and which organizations should be approved. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
