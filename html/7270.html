SUMMARY:  THE ABU DHABI CAMPUS AT THE UAE\'S ZAYED UNIVERSITY </p><p>(ZU) FOR WOMEN RECENTLY HELD A STUDENT BAZAAR TO EXHIBIT STUDENT </p><p>PROJECTS AND ARTWORKS AND TO RAISE MONEY FOR THE UAE RED CRESCENT </p><p>SOCIETY\'S HUMANITARIAN AID DRIVE FOR IRAQI CHILDREN.  DURING THE </p><p>BAZAAR, APAO DISCUSSED LOCAL EVENTS AND THE WAR IN IRAQ WITH ZU </p><p>STUDENTS, STAFF, FACULTY, AND ADMINISTRATORS.  WHILE FRUSTRATION </p><p>WITH THE WAR IN IRAQ AND DISMAY AT IMAGES OF IRAQI CIVILIAN </p><p>CASUALTIES SIMMER BELOW THE SURFACE, LIFE AT ZU IS BUSINESS AS </p><p>USUAL FOR EMIRATI STUDENTS, ARAB EXPATRIATE STAFF, AND WESTERN </p><p>FACULTY.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  ZU\'S FEMALE STUDENTS, INCLUDING DAUGHTERS OF UAE ELITE, </p><p>AVOIDED DISCUSSION OF THE WAR IN IRAQ WITH APAO.  INSTEAD, </p><p>SEVERAL STUDENTS, INCLUDING THOSE WHO KNEW PAS STAFF PERSONALLY, </p><p>TALKED WITH APAO ABOUT THE YOUNG AMBASSADORS AND OTHER </p><p>INTERNATIONAL VISITORS EXCHANGE PROGRAMS.  ZU STUDENTS SEEMED </p><p>MORE CONCERNED WITH INVITING US TO LOOK AT THEIR ARTWORK, TELLING </p><p>US ABOUT THEIR POETRY, OR URGING US TO VOTE IN A CONTEST TO </p><p>CHOOSE A BEST DRAWING RATHER THAN ENGAGING ON IRAQI CIVILIAN </p><p>CASUALTIES, THE WAR IN IRAQ, AND U.S. FOREIGN POLICY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  NEVERTHELESS, ZU STUDENTS REMAIN VERY CONCERNED WITH THE </p><p>PLIGHT OF THE IRAQI PEOPLE AND, IN PARTICULAR, IRAQI CHILDREN. </p><p>ONE OF ZU\'S AMERICAN ADMINISTRATORS INFORMED APAO THAT "LOUDER, </p><p>MORE RAUCOUS, AND PARTICIPATORY EVENTS" HAD BEEN PLANNED BY THE </p><p>ZU STUDENT COUNCIL FOR THE BAZAAR.  HOWEVER, THE CAMPUS </p><p>ADMINISTRATOR PUT A HALT TO THESE EVENTS AFTER RECEIVING A CALL </p><p>FROM THE HIGHEST LEVELS.  WHILE THE RESULT WAS A STUDENT BAZAAR </p><p>ONE WOULD EXPECT AT ANY UNIVERSITY, THE ZU STUDENT COUNCIL VICE </p><p>PRESIDENT RESIGNED AS COORDINATOR OF THE EVENT TO PROTEST THE </p><p>ADMINISTRATION\'S DECISION TO BAR THE PLANNED ACTIVITIES.   THE </p><p>OFFICIAL ALSO EXPLAINED THAT STUDENTS HAD PLANNED A PEACE VIGIL </p><p>LATER IN THE WEEK, BUT THIS WAS ALSO DENIED PERMISSION. </p><p> </p><p>4.  THE ADMINISTRATOR FURTHER NOTED THAT THE AMERICAN FACULTY </p><p>WERE NOT UNCOMFORTABLE WITH LOCAL POLITICAL CONDITIONS.  WHILE </p><p>NOTING TAXI DRIVERS SEEMED "MORE DISTANT" THAN USUAL, THE </p><p>OFFICIAL REPORTED THAT NO AMERICAN FACULTY HAD RETURNED TO THE </p><p>U.S. AS A RESULT OF THE WAR.  ONE CANADIAN FACULTY MEMBER </p><p>RECENTLY RESIGNED BUT THIS WAS DUE TO PERSONAL AND FAMILY </p><p>REASONS.   SEVERAL AMERICAN FACULTY MEMBERS REQUESTED </p><p>CLARIFICATION OF THEIR CONTRACT STATUS IF AN EVACUATION OF ABU </p><p>DHABI WAS NECESSARY, BUT LOCAL CONDITIONS DID NOT WARRANT A </p><p>RESPONSE AT THIS TIME, THE OFFICIAL NOTED.  TO HEAD OFF ANY </p><p>ADDITIONAL CONCERNS, THE ZU ADMINISTRATION RECENTLY MET WITH ZU\'S </p><p>DUBAI AND ABU DHABI STAFFS TO PROVIDE REASSURANCE AND TO </p><p>ENCOURAGE THE FACULTY TO AVOID ANY CLASSROOM OR INFORMAL </p><p>DISCUSSIONS WITH STUDENTS ON REGIONAL EVENTS UNLESS NECESSARY FOR </p><p>COURSE PURPOSES.  AN INFORMAL CHAT WITH TWO AMERICAN FACULTY </p><p>MEMBERS LENT SUPPORT TO THIS VIEW, AS THEY INDICATED THEY HAD NO </p><p>INTENTION OR DESIRE TO LEAVE ABU DHABI IN THE NEAR FUTURE. </p><p> </p><p>5.  DURING THE BAZAAR, AN IRAQI STAFF MEMBER AND VENDOR EXPRESSED </p><p>THEIR CONCERNS ABOUT THE WAR WITH THE APAO.  BOTH HAVE FAMILY </p><p>MEMBERS IN IRAQ WITH WHOM THEY HAVE NOT COMMUNICATED FOR TWO </p><p>WEEKS.  THE IRAQI STAFF MEMBER RECEIVED A MESSAGE FROM HER FAMILY </p><p>URGING HER TO GET HER FAMILY OUT OF BAGHDAD.  SHE LOST CONTACT </p><p>WITH THEM BEFORE THE MESSAGE ARRIVED.  SIMILARLY, AN IRAQI VENDOR </p><p>SELLING IRAQI ARTWORKS AND HANDICRAFTS CRIED AS SHE EXPLAINED THE </p><p>HISTORY OF HER ARTWORKS.  SHE ALSO LOST CONTACT WITH FAMILY </p><p>MEMBERS STILL IN IRAQ.  BOTH WERE FRUSTRATED BUT ONLY EXPRESSED </p><p>THEIR CONCERNS FOR THEIR FAMILY\'S WELFARE AND DID NOT COMMENT ON </p><p>THEIR SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION TO THE WAR. </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
