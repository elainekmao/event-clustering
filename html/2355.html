THE ITALIAN MINISTER OF </p><p>AGRICULTURE ORDERED THE NATIONAL SEED </p><p>CERTIFICATION ENTITY (ENSE) TO PROVIDE BY </p><p>JANUARY 12 ASSESSMENT OF THE AVAILABILITY OF </p><p>GMO-FREE SOY AND CORN SEEDS FOR PLANTING. TO </p><p>CONSIDER AN EXPANSION OF THE POTENTIAL </p><p>SOURCES OF NON-GM SEEDS FOR THE 2002 PLANTING </p><p>SEASON, THE MINISTER CONTEMPLATES RESCINDING </p><p>EXISTING MINIMUM STANDARDS ON SEED </p><p>GERMINATION FOR THESE TWO SEED TYPES. </p><p>MINISTER ALEMANNO WILL DECLARE A TOLERANCE </p><p>FOR ADVENTITIOUS PRESENCE OF GM MATERIAL IN </p><p>SEEDS FOR PLANTING BASED ON THE FINDINGS OF </p><p>THE ENSE STUDY. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. ITALIAN MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE GIOVANNI </p><p>ALEMANNO ISSUED A DECREE DECEMBER 28, 2001 </p><p>REQUIRING A SURVEY ON AVAILABILITY OF SOY AND </p><p>CORN SEED WHICH ARE FREE FROM ADVENTITIOUS </p><p>PRESENCE OF GENETICALLY MODIFIED MATERIAL. </p><p>THE SEED CERTIFICATION INSTITUTE WHICH WILL </p><p>CARRY OUT THE SURVEY IS ENTE NAZIONALE </p><p>SEMENTI ELETTE, ENSE, A TECHNICAL OFFICE </p><p>FUNDED BY THE MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE AND </p><p>DIRECTED BY A BOARD APPOINTED BY THE </p><p>MINISTER. IN THE DEC 28 DECREE ALEMANNO </p><p>PRESUMED A CONSENSUS AMONG ITALIAN PRODUCERS </p><p>TO KEEP THE ITALIAN FOOD CHAIN FREE OF GMOS. </p><p> </p><p>3. THE DECREE STATES THAT IN ORDER TO </p><p>CONSIDER SOURCES OF CORN AND SOYBEAN SEEDS </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  00042  031430Z </p><p>FOR PLANTING WHICH ARE ABLE TO COMPLY WITH A </p><p>ZERO TOLERANCE FOR GM MATERIAL, CURRENT </p><p>MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR SEED GERMINATION RATES </p><p>MAY BE SUSPENDED. IN ORDER TO BE MARKETED IN </p><p>ITALY SEED CORN IS CURRENTLY REQUIRED TO HAVE </p><p>A GERMINATION RATE OF AT LEAST 90 PERCENT AND </p><p>SOYBEAN SEED MUST GERMINATE AT 80 PERCENT. </p><p> </p><p>4.  DATA ON SEED SALES FOR 2000 SHOW THAT THE </p><p>UNITED STATES SUPPLIED HALF, BY VALUE, OF </p><p>ITALY\'S CORN SEED IMPORTS. THE UNITED STATES </p><p>SUPPLIED ABOUT EIGHTY FOUR PERCENT OF ITALY\'S </p><p>IMPORTS OF SOYBEAN SEED FOR PLANTING IN THE </p><p>SAME YEAR. THE VALUE OF UNITED STATES SALES </p><p>OF THE TWO TYPES OF SEED WAS APPROXIMATELY </p><p>DOLS 32 MILLION. </p><p> </p><p>5. COMMENT: THIS DECREE IS NOT ONLY </p><p>UNEXPECTED BUT IT ALSO APPEARS TO CONTRADICT </p><p>WHAT ALEMANNO TOLD SECRETARY VENEMAN IN </p><p>NOVEMBER 2001. DURING SECRETARY VENEMAN\'S </p><p>MEETING WITH ALEMANNO HE VOLUNTEERED THAT </p><p>ZERO TOLERANCE FOR GMOS WAS UNATTAINABLE. WE </p><p>HAVE SEEN SIGNALS FROM ALEMANNO THAT HE IS </p><p>BECOMING MORE ANTI-GMO SINCE THAT TIME. THIS </p><p>POST\'S SOUNDING OF THE SKELETAL EPIPHANY WEEK </p><p>GOI REVEALS NO INDICATION THAT THE DECREE IS </p><p>ANYTHING BUT AN ALEMANNO MINISTRY OF </p><p>AGRICULTURE INITIATIVE. WE ARE DEVELOPING </p><p>INTERVENTION RECOMMENDATIONS. END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  00042  031430Z </p><p>6.
