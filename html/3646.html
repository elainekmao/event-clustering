<p>UNCLAS COLOMBO 001626 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR S/CT AND DS/ATA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: CE, KTIA, PTER, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT: SRI LANKA AND ATA TRAINING:  A PLEA FOR IT TO </p><p>CONTINUE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Prior to his departure for R&R Ambassador Wills asked </p><p>that the following message be sent. </p><p> </p><p>BEGIN TEXT </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) I have recently heard that S/CT and DS/ATA no longer </p><p>consider Sri Lanka a priority country when determining which </p><p>countries should benifit from the Anti-Terrorism Assistance </p><p>(ATA) Training Program. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) I hope that this is not true. The ATA program has been </p><p>extremely effective in training SL forces and in extending </p><p>American influence as the GSL for 20 years has battled one of </p><p>the world\'s deadliest terrorist groups, the LTTE (an FTO </p><p>listed group). </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) I have served in many countries where the ATA </p><p>program existed -- most recently as DCM in India where I </p><p>cancelled the program due to Indian abuse.  I am cognizant of </p><p>the potential benifit ATA can yield to a country as well as </p><p>the program\'s potential to be misused. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) I think the case to continue ATA training in Sri </p><p>Lanka is strong.   Sri Lanka consistently receives </p><p>compliments from ATA instructors and State Department escort </p><p>officers.  Here, unlike what was the case in India, this </p><p>needed program is very much appreciated -- especially by the </p><p>current pro-US government.  The program has had an impact. </p><p>Sri Lanka incorporates ATA curriculum into its police </p><p>training.  It sends candidates who can directly benifit from </p><p>the training - not political cronies.  Recent ATA graduates </p><p>include the Acting Inspector General of Police and likely </p><p>successor to the recently deceased IGP and many other </p><p>high-level police officials.  The corresponding benifit to </p><p>the USG from ATA training is immense as competent, pro-US </p><p>officers take positions of responsibility in the effort </p><p>against terror.  The ATA program review in 2001 found that </p><p>Sri Lanka was indeed using the training in an efficient and </p><p>productive manner. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) On the heels of the Sri Lankan Prime Minister\'s </p><p>meeting with President Bush and the recent visit of Deputy </p><p>Secretary Armitage to Sri Lanka, decreasing ATA\'s engagement </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>in this country would send the wrong message.  At a time when </p><p>we are increasing assistance to Sri Lanka, a reduction or </p><p>elimination of one of our highest profile and most successful </p><p>programs, and in one of our highest priority areas, to wit </p><p>the fight against terror, causes me concern. </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) I respectfully ask that S/CT and DS/ATA consider the </p><p>above when deciding which countries should benifit from ATA </p><p>training.  In my view, Sri Lanka deserves this program.  It\'s </p><p>a program which should be increased rather than reduced. </p><p> </p><p>7. (U)  Thank you very much, Ambassador E. Ashley Wills </p><p> </p><p>END TEXT </p><p> </p><p>AMSELEM </p><p></p></div>
