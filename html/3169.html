<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ROME 003006 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EUR/ERA, EB/IFD/OMA </p><p>STATE ALSO PASS TO SEC - FRIEDMAN </p><p>STATE ALSO PASS FRB - O\'DAY </p><p>TREASURY FOR DAS SOBEL, MONROE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  03006  01 OF 02  191443Z </p><p>FRANKFURT FOR TREASURY - WALLAR </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, EU, EU, IT, ITEFIN </p><p>SUBJECT: KEY ADVISOR TO EU PARLIAMENTARIAN ON EU FINANCIAL </p><p>SERVICES ACTION PLAN AND BILATERAL INVESTMENT TREATIES </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. A: STATE 79760 </p><p> </p><p>     B. B: STATE 822480 AND PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) THIS IS AN ACTION REQUEST.  SEE PARAGRAPH SIX. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) SUMMARY. THE EU\'S FINANCIAL SERVICES ACTION PLAN </p><p>(FSAP) REPRESENTS A GIANT STEP FORWARD FOR EUROPE, ARGUED </p><p>ALESSANDRO MARIA POGGIALI, A SENIOR ADVISOR TO EU </p><p>PARLIAMENTARIAN, RENATO BRUNETTA.  WITH DETAILS OF THIS </p><p>ACTION EMERGING FROM THE COMMISSION, POGGIALI DOES NOT EXPECT </p><p>THAT ITALY WILL HAVE ANY STRONG OBJECTIONS. ITALIAN </p><p>INVESTMENT AND FINANCIAL FIRMS ARE, HOWEVER, CONCERNED THAT </p><p>THEY WILL NOT BE COMPETITIVE IN A HARMONIZED EUROPEAN </p><p>FINANCIAL MARKET.  POGGIALI APPRECIATED HEARING U.S. VIEWS ON </p><p>THIS FINANCIAL SERVICES PLAN. ON AN UNRELATED TOPIC, WE </p><p>RAISED USG CONCERNS ABOUT THE TREATMENT OF BILATERAL </p><p>INVESTMENT TREATIES BETWEEN THE U.S. AND CANDIDATE COUNTRIES </p><p>WITH POGGIALI. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) PER REFTEL INSTRUCTIONS, WE ARE SETTING UP MEETINGS TO </p><p>DISCUSS THE EU\'S FINANCIAL SERVICES ACTION PLAN. WE HAVE </p><p>DISCUSSED REFTEL POINTS WITH OFFICIALS AT THE FINANCE </p><p>MINISTRY, WHO HAD ONLY A VAGUE KNOWLEDGE OF THE PLAN, AND WHO </p><p>INDICATED THAT ALL THE ACTION AND DISCUSSIONS ARE OCCURRING </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  03006  01 OF 02  191443Z </p><p>IN BRUSSELS. POGGIALI IS THE SENIOR ADVISOR ON ECONOMIC </p><p>ISSUES TO EU PARLIAMENTARIAN, RENATO BRUNETTA.  AN </p><p>INFLUENTIAL MEMBER OF ITALY\'S FORZA ITALIA PARTY, BRUNETTA IS </p><p>PART OF THE PRIME MINISTER\'S INNER CIRCLE ON ECONOMIC ISSUES. </p><p> POGGIALI IS FAMILIAR WITH THE FINANCIAL SERVICES PLAN, AND </p><p>INDICATED HE WILL PLAY A CRITICAL ADVISORY ROLE ON THIS ISSUE </p><p>DURING THE PARLIAMENTARY DEBATE. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) ACCORDING TO POGGIALI, THE COMMISSION\'S RAPPORTEUR </p><p>FOR THE FINANCIAL SERVICES ACTION PLAN (FSAP) COULD PUBLISH A </p><p>WORKING DOCUMENT BY THE END OF JUNE. UNDER THIS TIMETABLE, </p><p>THERE WILL BE A PARLIAMENTARY EXCHANGE OF VIEWS BEFORE THE </p><p>SUMMER RECESS AND A SECOND EXCHANGE OF VIEWS BY THE END OF </p><p>AUGUST. IF THE PROCESS UNFOLDS SMOOTHLY, A FINAL REPORT COULD </p><p>BE ISSUED IN SEPTEMBER, WITH A COMMITTEE VOTE IN OCTOBER, AND </p><p>A PLENARY VOTE IN NOVEMBER. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) WE SHARED WITH POGGIALI REFTEL POINTS, WHICH </p><p>UNDERSCORED THE USG\'S GENERAL SUPPORT FOR THE FSAP BUT ALSO </p><p>OUR CONCERN THAT THE PLAN\'S IMPLEMENTATION COULD RESULT IN </p><p>DISCRIMINATORY TREATMENT OF U.S. FIRMS.  POGGIALI EMPHASIZED </p><p>THAT SUCH IS NOT THE INTENT OF THE FSAP, AND THAT ITS GOAL IS </p><p>A TRANSPARENT AND COMPETITIVE MARKET.  WE ALSO RAISED OUR </p><p>CONCERNS ABOUT SUCH ISSUES AS "EQUIVALENCY".  (PER REFTEL, </p><p>EQUIVALENCY REFERS TO THE REQUIREMENT FOR FIRMS FROM THIRD </p><p>COUNTRIES THAT OPERATE IN THE EU TO EXPLICITLY COMPLY WITH EU </p><p>PROSPECTUS STANDARDS.) </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) ACTION REQUEST: POGGIALI ASKED FOR SPECIFIC POINTS IN </p><p>WRITING THAT SPELL OUT USG CONCERNS. POST BELIEVES THIS WOULD </p><p>BE USEFUL, AND IF A NON-PAPER EXISTS, REQUESTS TEXT AND </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  03006  01 OF 02  191443Z </p><p>AUTHORIZATION TO SHARE WITH POGGIALI AND GOI OFFICIALS. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) WHEN QUERIED IF THE COMMISSION AND PARLIAMENT ARE </p><p>SEEKING THE ADVICE AND OPINION OF FINANCIAL FIRMS, POGGIALI </p><p>SAID THAT HE HAS SPOKEN WITH OFFICIALS FROM CONSOB (ITALY\'S </p><p>EQUIVALENT TO THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION) AND </p><p>FROM ABI, THE ITALIAN BANKING ASSOCIATION.  BOTH CONSOB AND </p><p>ABI EXPRESSED STRONG SUPPORT FOR THE FSAP, BUT OFFICIALS ALSO </p><p>UNDERSCORED THEIR CONCERN THAT ITALIAN FINANCIAL FIRMS WILL </p><p>NOT BE ABLE TO COMPETE IN THIS NEW, HARMONIZED MARKET. </p><p>CONCURRING, POGGIALI SAID HE HAS HEARD A GENERAL UNEASE FROM </p><p>ITALIAN FINANCIAL FIRMS, WHO FEAR THAT THEY WILL BE BOXED OUT </p><p>BY OTHER EUROPEAN FINANCIAL FIRMS IN THEIR OWN MARKET. </p><p>(COMMENT: WE ALSO CONCUR. ITALIAN FINANCIAL FIRMS FOCUS </p><p>PRIMARILY ON THE HOME MARKET. FEW FOREIGN INVESTMENT AND </p><p>RETAIL BANKS ARE PRESENT IN THIS MARKET. LABYRINTHINE RULES, </p><p>RED TAPE, MINIMAL NEED FOR STOCK AND BOND OFFERINGS (SINCE </p><p>MOST BUSINESSES ARE SMALL OR MEDIUM-SIZED, AND FAMILY-OWNED) </p><p>GIVE THE ADVANTAGE TO ITALIAN FIRMS AND MAKE THE ITALIAN </p><p>MARKET LARGELY UNATTRACTIVE TO FOREIGN FIRMS. ITALIAN FIRMS </p><p>HAVE NOT VENTURED MUCH BEYOND ITALY\'S BORDERS INTO THE REST </p><p>OF THE EU. UNLESS ITALIAN FINANCIAL FIRMS QUICKLY ADOPT A </p><p>MORE COMPETITIVE STRATEGY, WITH AN OPEN, TRANSPARENT AND </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ4495 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  03006  02 OF 02  191444Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00  COME-00  CTME-00  DODE-00 </p><p>      ITCE-00  SRPP-00  EB-00    EXME-00  E-00     UTED-00  VC-00 </p><p>      FRB-00   H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    ITC-01   LAB-01 </p><p>      L-00     AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OMB-01   OPIC-01  ACE-00 </p><p>      SEC-01   SP-00    SSO-00   SS-00    STR-00   TEST-00  USIE-00 </p><p>      FMP-00   EPAE-00  DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /010W </p><p>                  ------------------BF801E  191445Z /38 </p><p>P 191432Z JUN 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 4338 </p><p>INFO EU CANDIDATE STATES COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p>EU MEMBER STATES COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p>AMCONSUL FLORENCE PRIORITY </p><p>AMCONSUL FRANKFURT PRIORITY </p><p>AMCONSUL MILAN PRIORITY </p><p>AMCONSUL NAPLES PRIORITY </p><p>DEPT OF TREASURY WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>USEU BRUSSELS PRIORITY 2719 </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 02 ROME 003006 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EUR/ERA, EB/IFD/OMA </p><p>STATE ALSO PASS TO SEC - FRIEDMAN </p><p>STATE ALSO PASS FRB - O\'DAY </p><p>TREASURY FOR DAS SOBEL, MONROE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  03006  02 OF 02  191444Z </p><p>FRANKFURT FOR TREASURY - WALLAR </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, EU, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: KEY ADVISOR TO EU PARLIAMENTARIAN ON EU FINANCIAL </p><p>SERVICES ACTION PLAN AND BILATERAL INVESTMENT TREATIES </p><p> </p><p>HARMONIZED MARKET, MANY WILL LOSE GROUND IN ITALY AND </p><p>EFFECTIVELY BE LOCKED OUT OF OTHER EUROPEAN MARKETS.

(SBU) TAKING THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS GENERAL EU </p><p>ECONOMIC ISSUES, WE RAISED USG CONCERNS ABOUT THE </p><p>COMMISSION\'S TREATMENT OF BILATERAL INVESTMENT TREATIES, </p><p>ESPECIALLY THOSE THE U.S. HAS WITH ACCESSION STATES (REFTEL </p><p>B).  POGGIALI WAS UNAWARE UNTIL NOW OF THIS CONTROVERSY BUT </p><p>INDICATED HE WILL LOOK FURTHER INTO IT.  COMPETENCY OVER </p><p>INVESTMENT ISSUES, HE NOTED, IS STILL OPEN BETWEEN MEMBER </p><p>STATES AND THE COMMISSION. UPON REFLECTION, HE THOUGHT THAT </p><p>IF OUR CONCERNS ABOUT COMMISSION ACTION ON BITS ARE VALID, </p><p>THIS MAY BE ONE WAY THE COMMISSION IS TRYING TO EXERT </p><p>COMPETENCY OVER THE ISSUE. </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) POGGIALI ASKED WHETHER THE USG IS IN COMMUNICATION </p><p>WITH COMMISSION OFFICIALS AND ACCESSION STATES, TO WHICH WE </p><p>AFFIRMED POSITIVELY.
