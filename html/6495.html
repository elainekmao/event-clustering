<p>UNCLAS COLOMBO 000456 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: MASS, PREL, PGOV, PTER, CE </p><p>SUBJECT:  SME LOR SUBMISSION FOR 30 MM BUSHMASTER CANNONS </p><p> </p><p>REF:  GOVERNMENT OF SRI LANKA LETTER OF REQUEST DATE 14 </p><p> </p><p>MARCH 2003 </p><p> </p><p>SUBJECT SME LOR SUBMISSION FOR 30MM BUSHMASTER CANNONS </p><p> </p><p>1. THE GOVERNMENT OF SRI LANKA HAS SUBMITTED REFERENCE </p><p>(FORWARDED UNDER SEPARATE COVER) REQUEST FOR A SYSTEM SALE </p><p>LETTER OF ACCEPTANCE FOR TEN 30MM AUTOMATIC "BUSHMASTER" </p><p>CANNONS WITH ASSOCIATED MOUNTING, FIRE CONTROL, TRAINING, </p><p>SPARES AND AMMUNITION. </p><p> </p><p>2. AMEMBASSY COLOMBO STRONGLY SUPPORTS THIS SALE AND IN </p><p>ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 70003 OF THE SAMM, THE FOLLOWING </p><p>INFORMATION IS SUBMITTED: </p><p> </p><p>A.  SRI LANKA REQUIRES THE BUSHMASTER CANNONS TO UPGRADE ITS </p><p>NAVY FAST ATTACK AND COASTAL PATROL CRAFT.  SRI LANKA NAVY </p><p>SHIPS OPERATING IN COASTAL WATERS ARE CURRENTLY OUTGUNNED BY </p><p>THE LTTE.  WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A SINGLE ANCIENT 40MM </p><p>CANNON ON THE NAVY\'S INDIAN-MADE OFFSHORE PATROL VESSEL, </p><p>DECK GUNS ARE ALL 20-23MM.   A US-DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE </p><p>ASSESSMENT OF THE SRI LANKAN MILITARY IN SEPTEMEBR 2002 </p><p>REPORTED THE WEAKNESS OF MARITIME SURVEILLANCE AND </p><p>INTERDICTION CAPABILITY TO BE THE CENTER OF GRAVITY IN THE </p><p>WAR AGAINST THE LTTE.  A LARGER CALIBER DECK GUN FOR THE </p><p>NAVY WAS THE ONLY LETHAL SYSTEM MENTIONED IN NEARLY FIVE </p><p>HUNDRED PAGES OF THE DOD ASSESSMENTS.  BUSHMASTER CANNONS </p><p>WOULD GIVE THE NAVY A GREATER CAPABILITY TO FIGHT THE </p><p>FASTER, MORE HEAVILY GUNNED LTTE BOATS, AND PROVIDE </p><p>ADDITIONAL INCENTIVE TO THE LTTE TO MOVE TOWARDS PEACE AND </p><p>AWAY FROM CONFLICT. </p><p> </p><p>B.  SIMILAR THOUGH SMALLER CALIBER WEAPONS ARE ALREADY IN </p><p>THE NAVY\'S INVENTORY, SO THERE SHOULD BE NO ALTERATION TO </p><p>FORCE STRUCTURE.  THE INCREASE IN RANGE, LETHALITY AND </p><p>ACCURACY HOWEVER, SHOULD GREATLY ENHANCE SRI LANKA\'S </p><p>CAPABILITY TO DEFEND ITS COASTAL WATERS AGAINST THE LTTE SEA </p><p>TIGERS. </p><p> </p><p>C.  IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT SRI LANKA\'S NEIGHBORS WILL HAVE </p><p>NO SIGNIFICANT OR NEGATIVE REACTION TO THIS SALE.  INDIA HAS </p><p>ASSISTED SRI LANKA AGAINST THE LTTE IN A NUMBER OF WAYS, NOT </p><p>THE LEAST OF WHICH HAS BEEN MARITIME INTERDICTION.  THE </p><p>INTRODUCTION OF A NAVAL WEAPON SYSTEM THAT MIGHT REDUCE </p><p>INDIA\'S ASSISTANCE REQUIREMENTS WOULD LIKELY BE VIEWED </p><p>POSITIVELY IN NEW DELHI. </p><p> </p><p>D.  WITH PROPER TRAINING, SAILORS IN THE SRI LANKA NAVY </p><p>SHOULD HAVE NO TROUBLE OPERATING AND MAINTAINING THE </p><p>BUSHMASTERS, AT LEAST UP TO AND INCLUDING INTERMEDIATE </p><p>LEVEL.  TRAINING AND SPARES ARE EXPECTED IN THE INITIAL </p><p>PURCHASE, SO THE NAVY WILL LIKELY TRAIN DEDICATED PERSONNEL </p><p>TO FOCUS ON BUSHMASTER SYSTEMS MAINTENANCE. </p><p> </p><p>E.  THIS SALE SHOULD BE FINANCED WITH COUNTRY FUNDS.  THIS </p><p>PROCUREMENT WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THE ANNUAL DEFENSE </p><p>PROCUREMENT BUDGET FOR 2003, BUT SENIOR OFFICIALS HAVE </p><p>VERIFIED THAT FUNDING WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE.  SINCE THE </p><p>PRIME MINISTER AND MINISTER OF DEFENSE HAVE DESIGNATED THIS </p><p>PROCUREMENT A PRIORITY, SUFFICIENT FUNDS SHOULD BE EARMARKED </p><p>FOR THE PURCHASE WITHIN THE REQUIRED TIME.  THE OVERALL </p><p>ECONOMIC IMPACT TO THE SRI LANKAN ECONOMY IS INSIGNIFICANT. </p><p> </p><p>F.  ALTHOUGH HUMAN RIGHTS CONSIDERATIONS CONTINUE TO BE A </p><p>PRIORITY WITH AMEMBASSY COLOMBO, THE GENERAL LEVEL OF HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS GUARANTEES IS GOOD AND IMPROVING CONTINUOUSLY IN SRI </p><p>LANKA.  THIS CONSDIERATION SHOULD NOT AFFECT THE PROPOSED </p><p>SALE. </p><p> </p><p>G. AMEMBASSY COLOMB0 STRONGLY RECOMMENDS THE APPROVAL OF </p><p>THIS PROPOSED SALE. </p><p> </p><p>3. POC FOR THIS ACTION IS LTC RICHARD S. GIRVEN, ARMY AND </p><p>DEFENSE ATTACHE, USDAO COLOMBO. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
