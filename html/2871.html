BARONE\'S CHALLENGING </p><p>MESSAGE WAS THAT:  THE MELTING POT STILL HOLDS ITS POWER: </p><p>THE PROMISE THAT ALL IMMIGRANTS CAN BE TRANSFORMED INTO "ONE </p><p>AMERICA" WHERE ALL CITIZENS ARE UNITED IN DEMOCRACY, FREEDOM </p><p>AND CIVIC RESPONSIBILITY. </p><p> </p><p>BARONE WAS EQUALLY IMPRESSIVE AND ENGAGING IN HIS </p><p>PRESENTATION ON CURRENT ISSUES IN THE U.S. CONGRESS, </p><p>ADDRESSED TO ITALIAN PARLIAMENT OFFICIALS AND JOURNALISTS. </p><p>(IN A FOLLOW UP ARTICLE FOR THE "U.S. NEWS AND WORLD REPORT" </p><p>ENTITLED "EUROPEANS FOR THE U.S.," BARONE REITERATES THAT </p><p>ITALY, AN IMPORTANT MEMBER OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, REMAINS A </p><p>STRONG SUPPORTER OF THE UNITED STATES AND GEORGE BUSH ON </p><p>SEVERAL FOREIGN POLICY ISSUES.) </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  02197  061623Z </p><p>BARONE\'S PRESENTATIONS WERE WIDELY COVERED BY ADN KRONOS </p><p>(NEWS AGENCY). </p><p> </p><p>7.
