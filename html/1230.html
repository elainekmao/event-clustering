SECSTATE 131524 </p><p>     B. BUCHAREST 1609 </p><p>     C. BAGHDAD 3010 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: POLITICAL SECTION CHIEF ROBERT S. GILCHRIST FOR REASONS </p><p>1.4 A, B AND D </p><p> </p><p>1. (S) Summary.  President Traian Basescu told an interagency </p><p>team led by Ambassador Richard Jones, Senior Advisor to the </p><p>Secretary and Coordinator for Iraq Policy, July 21 that </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Romania is "unconditionally committed" to a continued troop </p><p>presence in Iraq.  Basescu highlighted the armed forces\' </p><p>financial burdens in light of recent massive domestic flood </p><p>relief efforts and stated that additional USG financial </p><p>support for defense reform might permit Romania to increase </p><p>its contribution in Iraq.  Though not a member of the Paris </p><p>Club, Basescu confirmed that Romania has agreed to Paris Club </p><p>terms and will forgive 80 percent of Iraq\'s debts, which </p><p>total USD 2.6 billion.  President Basescu also raised </p><p>Romania\'s request to interview security detainee and </p><p>Iraqi-American citizen Mohammed Munaf, who is a criminal </p><p>suspect in Romania.  Defense Minister Atanasiu reaffirmed the </p><p>GOR\'s commitment in Iraq but provided insights into cost </p><p>saving measures under consideration by the MOD, including </p><p>possible reductions of overseas deployments in 2006.  Senior </p><p>MFA interlocutors also underscored the GOR\'s support for a </p><p>continued GOR presence in Iraq, stressing the importance of a </p><p>renewed UNSC mandate as well as an Iraqi government request </p><p>for a Multinational Force (MNF) presence.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>President Basescu: Unconditional Commitment to Iraq </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>2. (C) Ambassador Jones initiated the meeting with President </p><p>Basescu, accompanied by State Counselor for National Security </p><p>General Constantin Degeratu and State Counselor for </p><p>International Relations Anca Ilinoiu, by expressing gratitude </p><p>for Romania\'s steadfast commitment in Iraq.  Ambassador Jones </p><p>singled out Romania\'s contribution to UN force protection in </p><p>Basra as particularly significant, given that an abiding </p><p>international civilian presence in Iraq, such as the UN </p><p>mission, remains a high priority and constitutes a bellwether </p><p>for other international organizations of improved security </p><p>conditions. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Basescu stated that the GOR faces deep budgetary </p><p>problems in the wake of recent severe flooding across Romania </p><p>(Ref B).  He characterized the flood-affected areas as </p><p>covering a "small surface but having a huge impact," with </p><p>bridges, railroads and villages destroyed and thousands </p><p>rendered temporarily homeless.  He noted that the GOR has </p><p>incurred mammoth costs operating an "air bridge" between </p><p>Bucharest and flood ravaged zones.  Naturally, he continued, </p><p>Romania\'s armed forces have played a key role in providing </p><p>relief and organizing cleanup and repair.  So far, the </p><p>Romanian military has spent about USD 60 million and </p><p>anticipates spending USD 100 million on flood related </p><p>activities.  Flood relief costs have placed tremendous </p><p>pressures on the armed forces\' budget.  In addition to limits </p><p>imposed by fiscal constraints, Basescu said that despite the </p><p>absence of "signals from the population" opposing Romania\'s </p><p>overseas deployments, some journalists could begin to ask </p><p>"Why not use our troops here?" given the urgency of the flood </p><p>crisis. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Basescu explained that the armed forces face another </p><p>"major problem" - delays in planned MOD modernization and </p><p>reform this year and in 2004.  "I am really disappointed that </p><p>reform is not going fast enough, there are still too many </p><p>conscripts," the President observed.  (Note: The MOD\'s goal </p><p>is an all-professional armed forces by 2007.  End Note.) </p><p>Basescu asked if it would be possible for the USG to increase </p><p>support for defense reform. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Basescu immediately added, however, "we will not put </p><p>any condition on participation in Iraq and Afghanistan if </p><p>support cannot be increased."  He promised that Romania will </p><p>"remain an ally until the end of the mission, we won\'t play </p><p>politically."  Romania will not put a "question mark" around </p><p>its participation and "will not in any event diminish </p><p>participation in Afghanistan and Iraq."  Nonetheless, he </p><p>continued, financial support could permit the GOR to consider </p><p>increasing its contribution in Iraq.  Basescu stated that, in </p><p>any event, troop withdrawal by the end of 2006 is </p><p>"optimistic" and "we are mentally prepared for the extension </p><p>of our presence in Iraq." </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Ambassador Jones expressed appreciation for Basescu\'s </p><p>realistic assessment of the need for a continued </p><p>Multinational Force (MNF) presence beyond 2006.  Both the </p><p>Ambassador and team member Brigadier General Mark Kimmitt, US </p><p>Army CENTCOM, discussed ongoing efforts to increase the </p><p>quality of Iraqi security forces, such as embedding MNF teams </p><p>in Iraqi units, with the ultimate goal of enabling the Iraqis </p><p>to take over the fight against terrorists and insurgents.  BG </p><p>Kimmitt underscored that on-the-ground conditions rather than </p><p>an artificial calendar must drive MNF force contributions. </p><p> </p><p>Basescu Proposes Possible Gendarme Training </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>7. (C) Basescu stated he had spoken with the Romanian </p><p>Interior Minister Vasile Blaga regarding possible additional </p><p>contributions Romania could make to strengthen Iraqi </p><p>institutions.  He said that Romania "could send trainers to </p><p>train the gendarmerie in Iraq." BG Kimmitt described the </p><p>enduring need for a well-trained Iraqi gendarmerie and </p><p>outlined possible training modalities.  Basescu affirmed that </p><p>although Romania is a small country with "limited resources" </p><p>it will remain a "solid partner" and contribute in areas </p><p>where it can, such as gendarme training. </p><p> </p><p>Debt Reduction Pledge </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>8. (C) President Basescu stated that following a recent Paris </p><p>Club agreement Romania has decided to reduce its Iraq debt </p><p>(which totals USD 2.6 billion) by 80 percent.  He noted that </p><p>Romania is not a member of the Paris Club but voluntarily </p><p>complied with its debt reduction Recommendation.  Ambassador </p><p>Jones expressed appreciation for Romania\'s decision to </p><p>substantially forgive its Iraqi debt, observing that among </p><p>the three prongs of international support for Iraq - </p><p>military, political and economic - economic assistance has </p><p>been the weakest prong.  Ambassador Jones noted that Romania </p><p>is a good example for other creditors, especially non-Paris </p><p>Club members and nations like Romania that face financial </p><p>constraints. </p><p> </p><p>Romanian Access to Security Detainee Munaf </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>9. (S) Basescu raised the subject of Iraqi-American national </p><p>Mohammed Munaf, now held as a security internee by Coalition </p><p>Forces in Iraq under the authority of UNSCR 1546, asserting </p><p>that Romanian "prosecutors need to have a discussion with </p><p>him" because of his suspected involvement in the kidnapping </p><p>of three Romanian journalists earlier this year.  He stated </p><p>that the GOR continues to seek the approval of American </p><p>authorities to meet with Munaf for a "four hour discussion." </p><p>He continued that the GOR believes Munaf can provide key </p><p>information about the ongoing prosecution of alleged </p><p>kidnapping mastermind, </p><p>Syrian-Romanian businessman Omar Hayssam, whom Basescu </p><p>asserted is suspected of providing "financial resources to </p><p>terrorists."  Basescu promised that the GOR would "respect </p><p>all procedures" during the interview and would conduct the </p><p>interview in any location designated by the USG, given that </p><p>he is a security detainee.  He added that, pursuant to </p><p>Romanian law, his lawyer would "probably like to attend" the </p><p>interview.  In response to a direct query from Ambassador </p><p>Jones, Basescu said that the interview did not need to take </p><p>place in the Romanian Embassy as a previous diplomatic note </p><p>had indicated.  Ambassador Jones promised to help facilitate </p><p>appropriate GOR access to Munaf.  Regarding Munaf\'s final </p><p>disposition, Ambassador Jones encouraged Romania to engage in </p><p>a close dialogue with Iraq.  Basescu replied that Romania </p><p>already has an "extremely close" dialogue with Iraq on Munaf </p><p>and other issues. </p><p> </p><p>Committed - But Cautious - Defense Ministry </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>10.  (C) In a separate meeting at the MOD, Defense Minister </p><p>Teodor Atanasiu, accompanied by State Secretary for </p><p>Euro-Atlantic Integration and Defense Policy Ion Mircea </p><p>Plangu and CHOD General Eugen Badalan, began his comments by </p><p>noting that the GOR has "the commitment to remain until the </p><p>Iraqi armed forces can take over."  Atanasiu asserted that </p><p>costs related to the recent flooding compel Romania to </p><p>consider either reducing its overseas deployments or seeking </p><p>"cofinancing."  Absent "substantial financing," Atanasiu </p><p>continued, Romania "should consider reduction of its troops </p><p>overseas by 300" in 2006.  (Note: According to MOD </p><p>statistics, about 1700 Romanian troops are currently deployed </p><p>overseas, with more than 850 in Iraq and 540 in Afghanistan. </p><p>End Note.) </p><p>11.  (C) Atanasiu iterated that "we will maintain our forces </p><p>in Iraq until the Iraqi forces can take over" but Romania </p><p>must consider various options for its 2006 overseas </p><p>deployments including "proportional reductions" or "equal </p><p>reductions."  In the latter alternative, Romania would </p><p>withdraw a total of three companies (i.e. about one hundred </p><p>troops in each company) from the Western Balkans, Afghanistan </p><p>and Iraq.  Atanasiu added that the GOR is currently weighing </p><p>whether to withdraw its frigate from participation in </p><p>Operation Active Endeavor in Mediterranean, with a decision </p><p>likely this month or in August.  Atanasiu and CHOD Badalan </p><p>outlined several possible cost saving measures, including </p><p>overseas deployment reductions, "delay in equipment </p><p>modernization," and cancellation of exercises, before </p><p>concluding that the MOD will consider a "mixture of options" </p><p>for cost saving.  Badalan interjected that the bottom line is </p><p>that the MOD must seek a solution </p><p>to save the 60 million dollars it has already spent on flood </p><p>relief efforts.  Atanasiu explained that the GOR also faces </p><p>"budgetary concerns" related to anticipated EU accession in </p><p>2007, which limit excessive deficits.  BG Kimmitt encouraged </p><p>the MOD and MFA to consult closely with the U.S. before </p><p>making any changes in Romania\'s force presence overseas.  He </p><p>emphasized that maintaining the force protection unit for the </p><p>UN at Basra is and should remain a top priority. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) The CHOD added that the MOD needs to justify its </p><p>activities in a post flood environment, which means telling </p><p>the Romanian people either that money earmarked for overseas </p><p>deployments comes from external sources (read: donors) or the </p><p>MOD is reducing its overseas commitments.  The Charge noted </p><p>that the USG is exploring ways to assist with flood relief. </p><p> </p><p>The Centrality of a UN Mandate </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>13.  (SBU)  Following a working lunch with MFA officials, MFA </p><p>Director General for Global Affairs Stelian Stoian chaired an </p><p>interagency working group that discussed the GOR\'s continued </p><p>commitment to a troop presence in Iraq.  Key GOR participants </p><p>were MOD Director General Claudiu Degeratu, External </p><p>Intelligence Service (SIE) Director General Silviu Predoiu, </p><p>Internal Intelligence Service (SRI) Colonel Mihai Munteanu, </p><p>MFA NATO Division Director Mirela Maghiar, and MFA Middle </p><p>East Division Deputy Director Laura Mircea. </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) MFA State Secretary for Global Affairs Teodor </p><p>Baconschi, the de facto number two Foreign Ministry official, </p><p>joined the interagency meeting in progress and reaffirmed the </p><p>GOR\'s commitment to a continued presence in Iraq as expressed </p><p>earlier in the day by President Basescu\'s "message."  He </p><p>underscored that the GOR supports the "extension of the </p><p>mandate" authorizing the presence of the MNF, as provided by </p><p>United Nations Security Council Resolution 1546.  MFA DG </p><p>Stoian stressed that a new UN mandate should be </p><p>"comprehensive, so that the MNF </p><p>can defend itself and the people, covering all </p><p>possibilities."  Stoian also asked whether the Iraqi </p><p>government "is ready to request officially that the UN </p><p>authorize a military presence in Iraq post-elections?" </p><p>Ambassador Jones observed that Iraq recognizes that a </p><p>continued MNF presence there is essential and the USG will </p><p>engage in "close consultations" with the Iraqis.  (Note: </p><p>UNSC 1546, Articles 9 and 10, provide that the "presence of </p><p>the MNF is at the request of the incoming Interim Government </p><p>of Iraq and that the MNF will have the authority "to take all </p><p>necessary measures to contribute to the maintenance of </p><p>security and stability in Iraq."  Senior GOR leaders strongly </p><p>seek a continued UN mandate and explicit Iraqi government </p><p>request for an MNF presence.  Additionally, they recognize </p><p>the importance of robust ROE for MNF participants.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>Engaging Reluctant Europeans </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>15. (C) Baconschi asked about the possible impact on USG </p><p>relations with "new" European states that have "announced </p><p>their intention to withdraw," opining that Romania and Poland </p><p>are the United States\' "strongest" Eastern European allies in </p><p>Iraq.  BG Kimmitt noted that the coalition remains solid; </p><p>with the exception of Spain, no other nation in the 62-member </p><p>coalition has formally announced that it is concluding its </p><p>activities in Iraq, although some states have reduced or </p><p>modified their contribution or already carried out their </p><p>pledged contribution.  He continued that the leadership of </p><p>Romania and Poland has been significant in maintaining the </p><p>coalition\'s solidarity.  Ambassador Jones pointed out that </p><p>after nearly two and one half years the coalition remains </p><p>alive and well. </p><p> </p><p>16. (C) DG Stoian stressed that the GOR, an EU aspirant, now </p><p>participates in the EU working group addressing the </p><p>development of an EU common foreign policy.  The GOR is </p><p>working to "generate support" from EU countries for </p><p>engagement in Iraq and "EU reluctance is not as strong as it </p><p>was one year ago."  Stoian cited the possible engagement of </p><p>gendarme units in training Iraqi forces as one example of how </p><p>the U.S. "can count on Romania to try to get more Europeans </p><p>involved."  Baconschi underscored these remarks by promising </p><p>that the GOR will remain "proactive in the EU and seek a new </p><p>climate among member states." </p><p> </p><p>UN Force Protection </p><p>------------------- </p><p>17. (C) During the interagency meeting, Ambassador Jones </p><p>highlighted the importance of Romania\'s contributions to UN </p><p>force protection, noting that a successful UN presence </p><p>encourages the presence of other international organization. </p><p>DG Stoian praised UN "experience and expertise" in preparing </p><p>for Iraqi elections and observed that the UN presence boosts </p><p>the electoral process\' credibility.  Stoian also solicited </p><p>the team\'s views about NATO\'s role in Iraq.  BG Kimmitt </p><p>responded that NATO provides "value added" in Iraq and that </p><p>the MNF and NATO complement each other\'s activities. </p><p> </p><p>18.  (C) Comment.  The GOR has demonstrated steady progress </p><p>on its defense modernization efforts notwithstanding </p><p>Basescu\'s expressed concerns about the slow pace of reforms. </p><p>According to a close presidential advisor, Basescu raised the </p><p>topic in order to suggest a possible source of USG funding </p><p>support that would, ultimately, allow the GOR to continue, </p><p>possibly even increase, its impressive troop commitment in </p><p>Iraq.  The Romanians\' worries about funding sources in the </p><p>wake of this summer\'s flooding are well founded.  Over the </p><p>past several weeks, Romania has faced its most serious </p><p>humanitarian crisis since the fall of communism in 1989. </p><p>Humanitarian concerns aside, the financial impact has been </p><p>devastating, not just in the MOD but throughout the GOR, </p><p>which is cash strapped at the best of times.  Against this </p><p>backdrop, overseas deployments could "backfire" against the </p><p>GOR as ordinary Romanians question the presence of Romanian </p><p>troops overseas when their manpower, know how and equipment </p><p>are needed to clean up and reconstruct in the wake of the </p><p>flooding.  Under these circumstances, Romania\'s unequivocal </p><p>promise to maintain troops in Iraq, its pledge to forgive the </p><p>lion\'s share of its Iraq debt and its willingness to help </p><p>train Iraqi gendarmes even if additional funding support is </p><p>not available, demonstrate the depth of its engagement to </p><p>building democracy and fighting terrorism in Iraq.   End </p><p>Comment. </p><p> </p><p>19. (U) Amembassy Bucharest\'s reporting telegrams are </p><p>available on the Bucharest SIPRNet website: </p><p>www.state.sgov.gov/p/eur/bucharest </p><p> </p><p>20.
