<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KATHMANDU 001424 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA, SA/INS </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/GURNEY, NSC FOR MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/30/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINR, PTER, ASEC, PINS, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL: DELIVERING USG MESSAGE TO MAOIST FACILITATOR </p><p> </p><p>REF: SECSTATE 219519 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Michael E. Malinowski for reasons 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1 (C) On July 30, DCM Robert Boggs met with Padma Ratna </p><p>Tuladhar, one of two Maoist facilitators to peace </p><p>negotiations with the Nepal Government (GON).  Post could not </p><p>meet with Babarum Bhattarai as suggested reftel since all of </p><p>the Maoist leadership reportedly has moved to India.  RSO and </p><p>PolOff also attended the meeting, which was held in a secure </p><p>area within the Embassy guard house. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The DCM opened the meeting by emphasizing that the </p><p>message to be conveyed had come directly from Washington and </p><p>that the U.S. Government takes very seriously the looming </p><p>break in the cease-fire.  He urged the Maoists to return to </p><p>the negotiating table as the only means to resolving the </p><p>conflict.  The DCM expressed concern over Maoist </p><p>anti-American rhetoric and refuted Maoist claims that the </p><p>U.S. has "hundreds of military advisors" in the country </p><p>unduly influencing the Government of Nepal in the peace </p><p>process. "It is simply not true," he said.  The DCM stressed </p><p>that any act of violence towards Americans or American </p><p>interests in Nepal by the Maoists would have serious and </p><p>unavoidable consequences.  He mentioned that the Maoists had </p><p>been put on the U.S. terrorist watch list as a result of the </p><p>killings of two Embassy security personnel as well as for </p><p>other actions taken against U.S. interests.  The DCM warned </p><p>Tuladhar that if the Maoists were to continue to act against </p><p>U.S. interests in Nepal, they could be re-designated onto </p><p>other terrorist lists, which would lead to the imposition of </p><p>sanctions and other serious repercussions for the Maoist </p><p>organization. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Tuladhar did not respond directly to these points and </p><p>suggested disingenuously that he did not have direct access </p><p>to Bhattarai.  The DCM replied that the Embassy was aware </p><p>that Tuladhar is a member of the Maoist organization despite </p><p>his role as facilitator and expected him to deliver this </p><p>message immediately.  Tuladhar then agreed to convey the </p><p>message as soon as possible to the Maoist leadership, which </p><p>he confirmed is now based in India.  He then asked whether </p><p>the USG would send someone to meet with Babarum Bhattarai in </p><p>India, "perhaps in New Delhi or Calcutta," if the Maoist </p><p>leader agreed to such a meeting. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Tuladhar attempted to suggest that the Maoists were, </p><p>in fact, fighting for democracy.  Citing U.S. criticism of </p><p>human rights abuses by the Government of Nepal during the </p><p>1990-1991 period of democratization and agitation and support </p><p>for Nepal\'s democratic forces, Tuladhar seemed to suggest </p><p>that the U.S. should support the Maoist cause.  He added that </p><p>the Maoist leadership\'s perception was that the USG did not </p><p>desire peace and was influencing the GON to pursue a military </p><p>strategy.  The DCM refuted these points, explaining that U.S. </p><p>policy has been and continues to be supportive of the peace </p><p>process.  The DCM added that the U.S. believes that only a </p><p>negotiated settlement, not a military solution, will resolve </p><p>this conflict.  However, the U.S. could not support the </p><p>Maoists because they have not shown themselves to be a </p><p>positive, democratic force that supports human rights and the </p><p>rule of law. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Biographic Note.  Tuladhar is a putative human rights </p><p>activist and an independent communist leader.  He was elected </p><p>to the House of Representatives as an independent candidate </p><p>supported by the CPN (UML) in the 1991 general election. </p><p>Tuladhar is an ambitious political player and reportedly </p><p>would seek a cabinet-level position within a </p><p>Maoist-influenced government.  End Biographic Note. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Comment.  Tuladhar is a slippery interlocutor. </p><p>Although the tone of the demarche was stern, Tuladhar </p><p>appeared totally unruffled.  Despite his protestations to the </p><p>contrary, Post considers Tuladhar an influential and </p><p>well-connected spokesman of the Maoists.  Tuladhar has proven </p><p>to be an effective channel of communication to the Maoists in </p><p>the past, although on this occasion he did not write down a </p><p>single note during the demarche.  Embassy will pursue other </p><p>third party interlocutors to convey reftel points.  End </p><p>Comment. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
