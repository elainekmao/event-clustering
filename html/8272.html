<p>S E C R E T COLOMBO 000876 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR DS/IP/SA, DS/DSS/ITA AND SA/INS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 1.6 X1, X6 </p><p>TAGS: ASEC, AEMR, PTER, CASC, CE, MIssion Security </p><p>SUBJECT: COLOMBO EAC MEETING May 23, 2003 </p><p> </p><p>REF: State 137077 </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by S.V. Wright, Regional Security Officer, </p><p>reason 1.5(C) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.   (SBU) On May 23, 2003 Colombo Emergency Action </p><p>  Committee (EAC) met to discuss our local security situation </p><p>  following the recent bombings in Saudi Arabia and </p><p>  Casablanca, and as recommended in reftel.  The DCM chaired </p><p>  the EAC. </p><p> </p><p>2.   (SBU) The EAC agreed that Colombo continues to be calm. </p><p>  Most local attention is focused on the LTTE\'s pulling away </p><p>  from the peace negotiations, and rescue efforts following </p><p>  last week\'s cyclone and flooding.  Events in Saudi Arabia </p><p>  and Casablanca have received little local attention.  All </p><p>  committee members advised that none of their staff had </p><p>  expressed any increased security concern. </p><p> </p><p>3.   (C) AID Director advised that her discussions with </p><p>  contractors and others suggested that Sri Lankan Muslims </p><p>  continued to be disorganized politically, and that she did </p><p>  not see any immediate threat to the US from them.  The EAC </p><p>  was of the opinion that other that a lone unstable attacker, </p><p>  there was little threat from local Muslims generally. </p><p>  Although the Muslim/LTTE situation in the east continued to </p><p>  be unstable and dangerous in the local context, the </p><p>  committee agreed that at the moment, a Muslim threat to US </p><p>  interests in Sri Lanka would have to come from outside Sri </p><p>  Lanka. </p><p> </p><p>4.   (S) RSO advised that all security assets remain at high </p><p>  alert, and commented that we continue to have solid police </p><p>  and police Special Task Force contacts in the east. None </p><p>  have reported any increased aggressive activity from that </p><p>  part of the country.  Additionally, the Director of Internal </p><p>  Intelligence (DII) had advised RSO as recently as May 19, </p><p>  that the DII had no US-related threat information.  DATT </p><p>  also reported that he had received no new threat information </p><p>  from the Directorate of Military Intelligence (DMI).  Both </p><p>  DATT and RSO agreed to question all sources again. </p><p>  Political section also agreed that they had not picked-up </p><p>  any indication of increased risk to US interests, either </p><p>  locally or from contacts in the north and east. </p><p> </p><p>5.   (U) IBB Station Manager reported civil disturbances in </p><p>  Puttalam, near the transmitter station.  Inter-communal </p><p>  rioting broke-out following the murder of a Muslim girl by </p><p>  her uncle after she married a Singhalese man.  Local police </p><p>  responded quickly with overwhelming presence and a local </p><p>  curfew, and the situation has cooled somewhat. </p><p> </p><p>6.   (U) The EAC reconsidered our previous in-country travel </p><p>  restrictions to Puttalam, the north and the east, and agreed </p><p>  that our tight restrictions should remain in effect for now. </p><p> </p><p>7.   (U) The EAC will reconvene as events dictate or if </p><p>  relevant information is received from sources. </p><p> </p><p>Wills </p><p></p></div>
