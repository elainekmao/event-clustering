<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 KUWAIT 002993 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR INR/R/MR, NEA/ARP, NEA/PPD, PA, INR/NESA, </p><p>IIP/G/NEA-SA, INR/B </p><p>WHITE HOUSE FOR PRESS OFFICE </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH, PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p>SECDEF FOR OASD/PA </p><p>CINCCENT FOR CCPA </p><p>USDOC FOR 4520/ANESA/ONE/FITZGERALD-WILKS </p><p>USDOC FOR ITA AND PTO/OLIA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KU, KDMR </p><p>SUBJECT: KUWAIT MEDIA REACTION SPECIAL, JULY 7: NATIONAL </p><p>ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS IN KUWAIT </p><p> </p><p>1.   SUMMARY: Kuwaiti media report that liberal incumbents </p><p>and members of Kuwait\'s Islamic Constitutional Movement were </p><p>the biggest losers in the July 5 parliamentary elections </p><p>that resulted in nearly half of all members losing their </p><p>seats. Most commentators believe that acting Prime Minister </p><p>Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad will form the new government rather </p><p>than the ailing Crown Prince (and nominal Prime Minister) </p><p>Sheikh Saad, with one daily declaring in a banner headline: </p><p>"Sabah Al-Ahmad Prime Minister." A mock election for women </p><p>by the Kuwait Journalists\' Association was held on election </p><p>day, drawing over 900 women "voters." </p><p> </p><p>In contrast with the pre-election period, only one editorial </p><p>repeats allegations of vote-buying by the government.  Other </p><p>commentators argue that the election results reflect the </p><p>victory of personal over national interests, with one </p><p>criticizing a tendency to vote along tribal lines rather </p><p>than according to the merits of the candidates. Another </p><p>notes that despite the liberation of Iraq, Islamist </p><p>candidates gained seats while liberals lost. One </p><p>conservative writer states that liberals risk further </p><p>isolation if they continue to adopt "deviant voices that </p><p>fight religion and attack scholars." </p><p> </p><p>Several liberal commentators argue that with Islamists </p><p>gaining seats in the National Assembly, progress will </p><p>suffer, as "religion is an obstacle to development." END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.   News Stories: All newspapers report that the most </p><p>prominent loser in the 2003 elections was the liberal </p><p>movement, which media reports indicate lost nearly half of </p><p>its seats in parliament. Most newspapers attribute the loss </p><p>to the liberals\' alliance with the government. The Islamic </p><p>Constitutional Movement (Muslim Brotherhood) won lost four </p><p>of its six seats, including that of its leader, MP Mubarak </p><p>Al-Duwaila.  The ICM loss of seats is attributed to their </p><p>inability to coordinate with the Islamic Salafi movement. </p><p>The Salafi movement was able to increase their </p><p>representation to three seats, and pro-government candidates </p><p>also made gains. </p><p> </p><p>According to Al-Qabas on July 7, an Amiri Decree to </p><p>commission the new government is expected within the next 48 </p><p>hours. The new National Assembly will reconvene on July 19. </p><p> </p><p>All newspapers speculate over who will form the new </p><p>government: Crown Prince (and nominal Prime Minister) Sheikh </p><p>Saad, or his Acting Prime Minister, Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmed. </p><p>Most pundits believe Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmed will form the new </p><p>government, and Al-Qabas declares in a front-page banner </p><p>headline "Sabah Al-Ahmed Prime Minister." </p><p> </p><p>Several papers and editorials argue that the 2003 election </p><p>results prove that tribal loyalties won out over political </p><p>and religious affiliations. </p><p> </p><p>All newspapers report that on July 5 the Kuwait Journalist\'s </p><p>Association held a mock election for women in which over 900 </p><p>women voted for MP candidates, with liberal candidates </p><p>receiving the most "votes." </p><p> </p><p>Four Arabic dailies prominently published Ambassador Richard </p><p>Jones\' Fourth of July statement in which he praised </p><p>democracy in Kuwait and called on Kuwaitis. On July 7, Al- </p><p>Qabas carries photographs of Ambassador Jones congratulating </p><p>winners of the election. </p><p> </p><p>Al-Qabas reports that most political sources believe that </p><p>the position of National Assembly speaker will go to former </p><p>Speaker and independent, pro-government millionaire </p><p>businessman, Jassim Al-Khorafi. </p><p> </p><p>Candidate Basil Al-Jassir is contesting the results of the </p><p>election in his district, alleging that fraud was involved, </p><p>Al-Seeyasah reports. </p><p> </p><p>Al-Watan reports on July 6 that the Minister of Interior has </p><p>ordered the court marshal of a number of Ministry of </p><p>Interior officers after discovering their interference in </p><p>the election process. </p><p> </p><p>Editorials: </p><p> </p><p>3.  "What Comes After the Elections?" </p><p>Conservative Dr. Sami Khalifa wrote in independent Al-Rai Al- </p><p>Aam (7/7): "The new Parliamentarians must now focus of three </p><p>issues: 1) They must force the government to change its </p><p>negative and provocative method in dealing with them; 2) The </p><p>necessity to adopt clear and serious political agendas that </p><p>could lead to uniting the parliamentary blocks, whether </p><p>liberal or Islamic; 3) The necessity of adopting draft laws </p><p>to restructure the relationship between the government and </p><p>Parliament by canceling the participation of the government </p><p>in any voting that takes place in the Parliament." </p><p> </p><p>4.  "A Reading in Patriotism" </p><p>Dr. Khalid Ahmad Al-Saleh wrote in independent Al-Watan </p><p>(7/7):  "The liberal movement is passing through a serious </p><p>curve. If this movement continues to. adopt deviant voices </p><p>that fight religion and attack scholars, it will end up </p><p>forgotten by the nation\'s conscience and out of the </p><p>Parliament. However, if this movement is led by members who </p><p>adopt democracy and respect the nation\'s [values, </p><p>traditions] doctrine and Islam, then people will grant them </p><p>another opportunity to represent them in a new National </p><p>Assembly." </p><p> </p><p>5.  "The National Assembly\'s Surprise" </p><p>Liberal Chairman of the Political Science Department at </p><p>Kuwait University, Dr. Shamlan Al-Essa wrote in independent </p><p>Al-Seyassah (7/7):  "The surprise in the recent elections </p><p>was the fall of the liberal and the Islamic powers. The </p><p>biggest winner in the elections was the government. [M]any </p><p>of the new MPs do not have new ideas or initiatives because </p><p>most of them come from tribes or clans or belong to the </p><p>[Islamist] Salafi movement. This means that they will not </p><p>lead any change but will rather wait for the government to </p><p>offer reform projects. What was also striking in the </p><p>elections was the re-election of those elected Ministers </p><p>[Ministers chosen from the body of elected MPs] who offered </p><p>services for their constituents through breaching rules and </p><p>regulations. The strong return of the elected Ministers </p><p>means that the Kuwaiti voter is no longer interested in </p><p>principles, values, ethics and the interest of Kuwait. His </p><p>main concern is to achieve his own interests and others can </p><p>go to hell." </p><p> </p><p>6.  "Self-Change" </p><p>Liberal Dr. Ahmed Al-Baghdadi wrote in independent Al- </p><p>Seyassah (7/7): "Change is natural. A lack of change in life </p><p>is the death of life itself. [An ideology based on] religion </p><p>is an obstacle to development. A human being can be a good </p><p>Muslim without adopting a religious ideology. Islamic groups </p><p>are paying dearly for attempting to confront the coming </p><p>globalization. The Kuwaiti people are mistaken if they </p><p>believe that the current situation will be in their </p><p>interests. They are mistaken if they replace the State\'s </p><p>institutions and the values of constitutional democracy with </p><p>tribal. relations. It is our responsibility to pave the road </p><p>for the new generation and this can only be achieved by </p><p>separating political ideology from religious ideology. </p><p>Breaking this link is necessary to preserve the right of </p><p>individuals to choose their religion." </p><p> </p><p>7. "Dues of the Results of the Elections" </p><p>Liberal former Ahmed Al-Rubei wrote in independent Al-Qabas </p><p>(7/7):  "There is a forthcoming young generation that wants </p><p>change and have proven themselves in various electoral </p><p>districts. Our duty is to start a dialogue [with these young </p><p>MPs] to stress to them that the whole issue is not just a </p><p>matter of change for the sake of change. We must stress that </p><p>there are demands for democracy, foremost among them being </p><p>honesty, foresight and the belief that moral and national </p><p>principles must not be compromised under the pretext of </p><p>change. [This election] has been a failure for all parties </p><p>and movements without exception, and this is a matter that </p><p>deserves a study. There has been popular disappointment, </p><p>which led the people to react without thinking and without </p><p>looking into the future." </p><p> </p><p>8. "Discrepancies That Need Reading and Analysis" </p><p>Former Secretary General of the Kuwait Democratic Forum, </p><p>Ahmad Al-Dayeen wrote in independent Al-Rai Al-Aam (7/7): </p><p>"The Kuwaiti voter has submitted his ballot for tribal and </p><p>family considerations rather than political considerations. </p><p>He was influenced by personal relations more than the </p><p>political stance of the candidates. He has benefited from </p><p>those candidates who gave out `favors and services,\' and </p><p>those capable of buying votes in cash. [In addition,] after </p><p>the September 11 attacks and the rise of the American role </p><p>in the region, many believed that liberal power would be </p><p>strengthened and Islamic groups contained, especially those </p><p>who rejected the war on Iraq. Rather, we see that the number </p><p>of liberals in the new Parliament has decreased while the </p><p>numbers of the [Islamist] Salafi movement have increased." </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
