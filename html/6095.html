HUMANITARIAN NGOS SEEKING FORMAL REGISTRATION IN TURKEY </p><p>CONTINUE TO FACE A CUMBERSOME PROCESS, BUT THE TURKISH </p><p>GOVERNMENT HAS SAID IT WILL CONSIDER EXPEDITED ARRANGEMENTS </p><p>TO ALLOW DELIVERY OF RELIEF TO IRAQ THROUGH TURKEY.  MEMBERS </p><p>OF THE UNITED STATES AGENCY FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT\'S </p><p>DISASTER ASSISTANCE RESPONSE TEAM (USAID/DART) ARE IN ANKARA </p><p>TO FACILITATE THE REGISTRATION OF NGOS IN THE COUNTRY. </p><p>USAID/DART STRONGLY RECOMMENDS THAT NGOS WISHING TO PROVIDE </p><p>HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE TO NORTHERN IRAQ THROUGH TURKEY </p><p>PURSUE A TRANSIT PERMIT IMMEDIATELY.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. THE PROCESS OF NGO REGISTRATION IN TURKEY HAS AND </p><p>CONTINUES TO BE A CUMBERSOME AND COSTLY ONE WHICH FEW NGOS </p><p>HAVE MANAGED TO SUCCESSFULLY NAVIGATE.  THE REGISTRATION </p><p>PROCESS CALLS FOR AN NGO TO SUBMIT EXTENSIVE DOCUMENTATION </p><p>TO THE GOT, WITH A REQUIREMENT FOR HIGH-LEVEL REVIEW OF EACH </p><p>APPLICATION TO REGISTER.  HOWEVER, IN TIMES OF CRISIS, THE </p><p>GOT HAS ALLOWED FOREIGN NGOS TO OPERATE IN TURKEY WITHOUT </p><p>COMPLETING THESE FORMALITIES.  DURING THE 1999 EARTHQUAKES </p><p>IN TURKEY, THE GOT ESSENTIALLY LOOKED THE OTHER WAY TO </p><p>ALLOWINTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS TO RESPOND TO </p><p>THE HUMANITARIAN SITUATION.  ORGANIZATIONS, SUCH AS THE </p><p>AMERICAN RED CROSS, DID RESPOND TO THE DISASTER BUT WITHOUT </p><p>COMPLETION OF THE REGISTRATION PROCESS.  THIS ARRANGEMENT </p><p>LEFT HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS IN A DIFFICULT SITUATION, AS </p><p>THEY WERE UNABLE TO SEEK LEGAL RECOURSE IN TURKISH COURTS, </p><p>COULD NOT FULLY COMPENSATE STAFF THROUGH SOCIAL SECURITY </p><p>CONTRIBUTIONS, AND EXPERIENCED DIFFICULTIES WITH TAXATION OF </p><p>HUMANITARIAN SUPPLIES FOR THE AFFECTED POPULATION. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. USAID/DART MEMBERS ARE ON THE GROUND IN TURKEY AS PART OF </p><p>THE USG\'S CONTINGENCY PLANNING FOR HUMANITARIAN RELIEF FOR </p><p>IRAQ.  USAID/DART MEMBERS, AS WELL AS EMBASSY PERSONNEL, </p><p>HAVE MET WITH THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS SEVERAL TIMES </p><p>IN RECENT WEEKS ON NGO ACCESS TO NORTHERN IRAQ VIA TURKEY. </p><p>TWO LIKELY SCENARIOS HAVE EMERGED FROM THESE DISCUSSIONS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  NGOS WISHING TO ESTABLISH A PRESENCE IN TURKEY, BY </p><p>PROGRAMMING FUNDS INSIDE THE COUNTRY OR ESTABLISHING AN </p><p>OFFICE, MUST PROCEED WITH THE FORMAL REGISTRATION PROCESS. </p><p>THIS PROCESS IS ONLY FOR NGOS WHO PLAN TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE </p><p>IN TURKEY. BASED ON INFORMATION PROVIDED BY THE MFA AND </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMITTEE FOR RED CROSS AND RED CRESENT </p><p>SOCIETIES (ICRC), USAID/DART BELIEVES THAT THIS PROCESS WILL </p><p>TAKE SEVERAL MONTHS.  MFA INSISTS THAT EXTERNAL RELIEF FOR </p><p>DISTRIBUTION IN TURKEY BE COORDINATED WITH THE TURKISH RED </p><p>CRESCENT AND/OR UN AGENCIES. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  A SECOND AND MORE PROMISING SCENARIO IS FOR NGOS TO SEEK </p><p>A TRANSIT PERMIT THAT WILL ALLOW HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS </p><p>TO PASS THROUGH TURKISH CUSTOMS AT THE BORDER TO NORTHERN </p><p>IRAQ, BUT NOT ESTABLISH A PROGRAMMATIC OFFICE OR PROGRAM </p><p>FUNDS INSIDE OF TURKEY.  THE MFA HAS SAID THAT IT WOULD </p><p>CONSIDER NGO APPLICATIONS TO DELIVER HUMANITARIAN RELIEF </p><p>ITEMS IN THE EVENT THERE IS A NEED FOR THEM IN IRAQ.  MFA </p><p>ADVISED THAT THIS PERMIT COULD BE ISSUED WITHIN SEVERAL </p><p>WEEKS.   USAID/DART FEELS THAT THIS OPTION WOULD EXPEDITE </p><p>THE PROVISION OF HUMANITARIAN RELIEF TO NORTHERN IRAQ AND </p><p>ALLOW NGOS TO TRANSIT THROUGH TURKISH CUSTOMS IN A TIMELY </p><p>MANNER.  USAID/DART IS INVESTIGATING WHETHER THIS TRANSIT </p><p>PERMIT WOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO PROVIDE NGOS LEGAL RECOURSE, </p><p>BENEFITS TO EMPLOYEES, AND RELIEF FROM TURKISH TAXATION ON </p><p>PURCHASE OF HUMANITARIAN SUPPLIES. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE WAY FORWARD </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  USAID/DART STRONGLY RECOMMENDS THAT NGOS WISHING TO </p><p>PROVIDE HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE TO NORTHERN IRAQ THROUGH </p><p>TURKEY PURSUE A TRANSIT PERMIT IMMEDIATELY.  THE MINISTRY OF </p><p>FOREIGN AFFAIRS ENCOURAGED ALL NGOS SEEKING TO TRANSIT </p><p>HUMANITARIAN RELIEF SUPPLIES TO CONTACT THE MFA DIRECTLY. </p><p>THE CONTACT FOR THIS PROCESS IS THE HEAD OF DEPARTMENT IN </p><p>THE OFFICE OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ORGANIZATIONS.  NGOS </p><p>SHOULD BE PREPARED TO SUBMIT INFORMATION, IN ENGLISH, ON </p><p>THEIR CHARTERS, FOUNDING MEMBERS AND BY-LAWS, AS WELL AS ON </p><p>ANY PRIOR EXPERIENCE IN TURKEY.  USAID/DART ALSO RECOMMENDS </p><p>THAT NGOS CONTACT DART MEMBERS IN ANKARA, AS WELL AS MISSION </p><p>DISASTER RELIEF OFFICER ALDO SIROTIC (TEL. 90 312 455-5555), </p><p>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THIS PROCESS.  USAID/DART </p><p>REQUESTS THAT OFDA/WASHINGTON FACILITATE THE BROADCASTING OF </p><p>THIS INFORMATION TO THE NGO COMMUNITY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. TO DATE, USAID/DART HAS BEEN IN CONTACT BEEN WITH SEVERAL </p><p>NGOS WISHING TO PROVIDE HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE THROUGH </p><p>TURKEY TO NORTHERN IRAQ, INCLUDING THE INTERNATIONAL RESCUE </p><p>COMMITTEE (IRC), MERCY CORPS INTERNATIONAL, AND SAVE THE </p><p>CHILDREN/USA.  IRC APPEARS TO BE THE FURTHEST ALONG IN THIS </p><p>PROCESS AND PLANS TO SUBMIT THESE MATERIALS TO THE MFA IN </p><p>THE NEAR FUTURE.  USAID/DART WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR AND </p><p>REPORT ON THE STATUS OF IRC\'S REGISTRATION, AS WELL AS OTHER </p><p>NGOS, TO ENSURE THAT THE PROCESS IS EXPEDITED AND AS </p><p>TRANSPARENT AS POSSIBLE.
