IRVING FOR </p><p>REASONS: 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY: PRESIDENT ROBERT MUGABE IS GEARING UP </p><p>FOR WHAT WILL BE THE MOST DIFFICULT ELECTION OF HIS </p><p>POLITICAL CAREER.  MUGABE WILL USE ALL THE RESOURCES OF </p><p>HIS OFFICE, THE RULING PARTY, AND THE STATE TO WIN RE- </p><p>ELECTION AND DENY THE OPPOSITION MDC THE PRESIDENCY. </p><p>THE PRESIDENT WILL USE A WIDE RANGE OF TACTICS, FROM </p><p>INTIMIDATION AND VIOLENCE AGAINST VOTERS, MANIPULATION </p><p>OF ELECTORAL LAWS, VOTE-BUYING, AND BALLOT STUFFING, TO </p><p>ACHIEVE HIS GOAL.  MUGABE STILL VALUES THE APPEARANCE OF </p><p>WINNING A LEGITIMATE ELECTION, SO HE WILL MAKE EVERY </p><p>EFFORT TO KEEP HIS TRANSGRESSIONS OUT OF PUBLIC VIEW. </p><p>MUGABE WILL DECLARE MARTIAL LAW OR A STATE OF EMERGENCY </p><p>ONLY AS A LAST RESORT TO FORESTALL A POPULAR UPRISING, </p><p>WHICH IS A POSSIBILITY ONCE MUGABE IS DECLARED THE </p><p>WINNER.  THE ROLE OF THE MILITARY WILL BE CRUCIAL, AND </p><p>ALL INDICATIONS ARE THAT IT WILL BACK MUGABE.  THERE </p><p>APPEAR TO BE ONLY TWO CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH MUGABE </p><p>WILL VOLUNTARILY LEAVE OFFICE: THERE IS A POPULAR </p><p>UPRISING OR A MASSIVE NUMBER OF PROTESTERS DESCEND ON </p><p>STATE HOUSE AND THE MILITARY DECIDES IT CANNOT PROTECT </p><p>THE PRESIDENT AND ASKS HIM TO STEP DOWN, OR HIS HEALTH </p><p>DECLINES SIGNIFICANTLY BY THE END OF THE YEAR AND HE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01178  01 OF 05  301230Z </p><p>DECIDES TO ANOINT EMMERSON MNANGAGWA AS ZANU-PF\'S </p><p>CANDIDATE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>MUGABE WILL DO ALL IT TAKES TO WIN </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) ALL INDICATIONS CURRENTLY POINT TO ANOTHER </p><p>MUGABE CANDIDACY FOR THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION THAT MUST </p><p>BE HELD BETWEEN JANUARY 1 AND MARCH 31, 2002.  IT IS OUR </p><p>ASSESSMENT THAT MUGABE WILL HOLD AN ELECTION, NO MATTER </p><p>HOW BAD THE ECONOMY GETS OR HOW UNPOPULAR HE BECOMES, </p><p>BECAUSE HE STILL VALUES THE LEGITIMACY AN ELECTION </p><p>CONVEYS, AND BECAUSE HE THINKS HE CAN WIN IT.  WE </p><p>BELIEVE AN EARLY ELECTION, WHICH WOULD REQUIRE MUGABE TO </p><p>RESIGN AND HOLD A NEW ELECTION WITHIN 90 DAYS, IS </p><p>UNLIKELY BECAUSE IT WOULD BE PSYCHOLOGICALLY DIFFICULT </p><p>FOR MUGABE TO RELINQUISH POWER, EVEN TEMPORARILY, AND IT </p><p>WOULD DEMONSTRATE WEAKNESS, WHICH HE DESPISES.  IT IS </p><p>OUR ASSESSMENT THAT THE PRESIDENT WILL USE ALL THE MEANS </p><p>AT HIS DISPOSAL TO WIN AN ELECTION OUTRIGHT, AND THAT </p><p>THE OPPOSITION DOES NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES TO OVERCOME </p><p>MUGABE\'S ADVANTAGES AS INCUMBENT.  THIS MESSAGE EXAMINES </p><p>MUGABE\'S LIKELY BLUEPRINT FOR STAYING IN POWER THIS YEAR </p><p>AND BEYOND NEXT YEAR\'S PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. </p><p> </p><p>IF YOU DON\'T WANT TO JOIN THEM, BEAT THEM </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) ALTHOUGH THE RULING ZANU-PF AND OPPOSITION MDC </p><p>HAVE NOT DECLARED THEIR OFFICIAL CANDIDATES, THE </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN IS ALREADY IN FULL SWING.  AT THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  01178  01 OF 05  301230Z </p><p>FOREFRONT OF PRESIDENT MUGABE\'S STRATEGY IS THE </p><p>SYSTEMATIC AND VIOLENT INTIMIDATION OF THE COUNTRY\'S </p><p>ELECTORATE, ESPECIALLY POOR, RURAL COMMUNAL FARMERS, THE </p><p>TRADITIONAL BACKBONE OF ZANU-PF SUPPORT.  THE STRATEGY </p><p>HAS WORKED MANY TIMES BEFORE FOR MUGABE.  ACCORDING TO </p><p>MICHAEL QUINTANA, A DEFENSE CONSULTANT AND FREE-LANCE </p><p>JOURNALIST TO WHOM POLOFF SPOKE ON MARCH 22, THE AVERAGE </p><p>RURAL FARMER IS UNWILLING TO "STICK HIS NECK OUT FOR </p><p>PRINCIPLES."  HE IS ALSO NOT POLITICALLY SOPHISTICATED </p><p>AND WILL LARGELY DO WHAT HE IS TOLD BY HIS SUPERIORS, </p><p>WHETHER IT IS THE LOCAL CHIEF OR THE PRESIDENT ON THE </p><p>RADIO, QUINTANA ADDED.  WHEN RURAL SUPPORT FOR ZANU-PF </p><p>SEEMED TO WAVER IN LAST YEAR\'S REFERENDUM AND </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS, THE PRESIDENT DECIDED NOT TO </p><p>TAKE ANY CHANCES AND RATCHETED UP THE INTIMIDATION AND </p><p>PROPAGANDA CAMPAIGN. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) WINNING THE RURAL VOTE IS NOT ENOUGH TO LOCK THE </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, HOWEVER.  THE URBAN VOTE WILL BE </p><p>CRITICAL, AND BY SOME ACCOUNTS, ZIMBABWE IS NOW 40 </p><p>PERCENT URBAN, WITH THE ACCELERATION OF ECONOMIC </p><p>MIGRATION TO THE CITIES OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS.  THE </p><p>SUPPORT FOR THE OPPOSITION REMAINS ALMOST TOTAL IN THE </p><p>URBAN AREAS.

WAR VETERANS ARE INCREASINGLY ACTIVE IN THE </p><p>CITIES AS WELL, RAIDING THE OFFICES OF COMPANIES SEEN TO </p><p>BE HARMING THE INTERESTS OF THEIR WORKERS.  MUGABE IS </p><p>ALSO ATTACKING THE "INSTRUMENTS OF OPPOSITION" BASED IN </p><p>THE CITIES, SUCH AS THE INDEPENDENT PRESS, THE </p><p>JUDICIARY, AND THE PRINCIPAL OPPOSITION PARTY ITSELF. </p><p>ZANU-PF HAS ITS WORK CUT OUT FOR IT IN THE URBAN AREAS, </p><p>WHERE IT IS DEEPLY UNPOPULAR, SO IT IS STARTING ITS </p><p>CAMPAIGN EARLY. </p><p> </p><p>CARROTS WILL HELP, TOO </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) THERE CONTINUE TO BE REPORTS THAT ZANU-PF </p><p>POLITICOS ARE TOURING THE COUNTRY HANDING OUT MONEY IN </p><p>POOR CONSTITUENCIES WHILE REMINDING VOTERS TO CAST THEIR </p><p>BALLOT FOR THEIR PRESIDENT.  PARTY COMMISSAR AND YOUTH </p><p>DEVELOPMENT MINISTER BORDER GEZI HAS BEEN REPORTED ON </p><p>SEVERAL OCCASIONS (INCLUDING TO US BY GOVERNMENT </p><p>OFFICIALS - SEE REF C) TO HAVE HANDED OUT MILLIONS OF </p><p>ZIMBABWE DOLLARS IN RURAL AREAS TO DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS, </p><p>AND IN SOME CASES, TO LOCAL OFFICIALS.  CRUCIAL TO THE </p><p>CAMPAIGN IS KICKING THE PROPAGANDA MACHINE INTO HIGH </p><p>GEAR.  THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN INCESSANT IN ITS MESSAGE </p><p>THAT THE MDC IS INCAPABLE OF RULING ZIMBABWE AND THAT </p><p>ONLY ZANU-PF HAS THE WHEREWITHAL TO MAKE THEIR LIVES </p><p>BETTER. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01178  02 OF 05  301231Z </p><p> </p><p>VOTERS\' ROLL IMPROVED, BUT THERE\'S STILL ROOM FOR FRAUD </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) ZIMBABWE\'S VOTERS\' ROLL HAS BEEN GREATLY </p><p>IMPROVED AND IT WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT TO MANIPULATE IT TO ZANU-PF\'S ADVANTAGE, </p><p>ACCORDING TO KNUD RASMUSSEN, DIRECTOR OF THE DANISH NGO </p><p>THAT HAS WORKED WITH THE GOVERNMENT OVER THE LAST YEAR </p><p>TO COMPUTERIZE AND REFORM THE VOTERS\' ROLL.  THE VOTERS\' </p><p>ROLL HAS BEEN FOLDED INTO THE NATIONAL REGISTRY, WHICH </p><p>CONTAINS BIRTH, MARRIAGE AND DEATH RECORDS AMONG OTHERS, </p><p>SO THAT THERE ARE NO LONGER TWO, MUTUALLY INCONSISTENT </p><p>NATIONAL DATABASES.  THE VOTERS\' ROLL IS NOW PRINTED </p><p>FROM THE NATIONAL REGISTRY, AN EXERCISE THAT TAKES TWO </p><p>TO THREE WEEKS BECAUSE OF LIMITED PRINTING RESOURCES. </p><p>NEARLY 3.2 MILLION RECORDS WERE ADDED OR UPDATED IN THE </p><p>RUN-UP TO LAST YEAR\'S PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS. </p><p>APPROXIMATELY 385,000 PEOPLE WERE LEFT OFF THE VOTERS\' </p><p>ROLL LAST YEAR BECAUSE OF DUPLICATIVE NATIONAL ID </p><p>NUMBERS.  THAT NUMBER HAS SINCE BEEN REDUCED TO 86,000, </p><p>AND IS EXPECTED TO BE RECTIFIED BEFORE THE PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>ELECTION, RASMUSSEN STATED.  IT WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT </p><p>FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO MANIPULATE THE VOTERS\' ROLL </p><p>BECAUSE IT DOES NOT HAVE THE SOURCE CODE TO THE </p><p>PROGRAMMING, AND IT DOES NOT HAVE THE TECHNICAL </p><p>EXPERTISE TO ISOLATE INDIVIDUAL RECORDS BASED ON A </p><p>PERSON\'S AGE OR LOCATION.  NOR CAN IT REMOVE RECORDS </p><p>VERY EASILY, RASMUSSEN ASSERTED. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) DESPITE HAVING A CLEANED-UP VOTERS\' ROLL THAT IS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  01178  02 OF 05  301231Z </p><p>RESISTANT TO FRAUD, THERE ARE STILL PLENTY OF WAYS THAT </p><p>GOVERNMENT CAN MANIPULATE THE VOTING PROCESS TO </p><p>PRESIDENT MUGABE\'S ADVANTAGE, ACCORDING TO RASMUSSEN. </p><p>AMONG THEM ARE: </p><p> </p><p>-- BECAUSE THE LAW SAYS ZIMBABWEAN CITIZENS MUST OBTAIN </p><p>A NATIONAL ID NUMBER BY THE AGE OF 16 AND THAT THEY MUST </p><p>HAVE AN ID NUMBER IN ORDER TO REGISTER TO VOTE, MANY </p><p>FIRST-TIME VOTERS COULD BE TURNED AWAY WHEN THEY GO TO </p><p>REGISTER.  MANY POOR, RURAL PARENTS NEVER REGISTER THEIR </p><p>CHILDREN\'S BIRTH BECAUSE OF THE EXPENSE OF DOING SO, SO </p><p>MANY YOUNG POTENTIAL VOTERS--MOST LIKELY MDC SUPPORTERS- </p><p>-COULD LEGALLY BE DENIED THE RIGHT TO VOTE. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE GOVERNMENT REFUSES TO PRINT THE VOTERS\' ROLL BY </p><p>NATIONAL ID NUMBER; INSTEAD, IT IS PRINTED </p><p>ALPHABETICALLY.  MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER ERRORS OFTEN </p><p>MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR VOTING OFFICIALS TO VERIFY A </p><p>VOTER\'S REGISTRATION, WHICH PROVIDES ANOTHER PRETEXT FOR </p><p>A VOTER MATCHING THE PROFILE OF AN OPPOSITION SUPPORTER </p><p>TO BE TURNED AWAY. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE TRANSPORTATION OF BALLOT BOXES IS STILL THE POINT </p><p>IN THE VOTING PROCESS MOST VULNERABLE TO FRAUD.  IF THE </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ6650 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  01178  03 OF 05  301231Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DINT-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00 </p><p>      DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00   FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00    H-01 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    DCP-01   NSAE-00 </p><p>      OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00 </p><p>      SP-00    IRM-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-01 </p><p>      DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /008W </p><p>                  ------------------D9520A  301231Z /38 </p><p>P 301234Z MAR 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 8543 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>SECDEF WASHINGTON DC </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 05 HARARE 001178 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>SECDEF FOR OSD/SA </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR CHARLES GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/30/11 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINR, PINS, MCAP, ZI </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  01178  03 OF 05  301231Z </p><p>SUBJECT: ZIMBABWE: HOW PRESIDENT MUGABE WILL HANG ON TO </p><p>POWER </p><p> </p><p>BOXES ARE NOT WATCHED EVERY STEP OF THE WAY TO THE </p><p>COUNTING CENTER, IT IS EASY TO STUFF THE BALLOT BOX </p><p>WITH, SAY, 300 BALLOTS AND CROSS OFF THE NAMES OF 300 </p><p>PEOPLE ON THE VOTERS\' ROLL WHO DID NOT VOTE.  ALTHOUGH </p><p>ZANU-PF AND THE MDC ASSIGN POLLING AGENTS TO MOST VOTING </p><p>CENTERS, INSUFFICIENT RESOURCES PREVENT THE OPPOSITION </p><p>PARTY FROM COVERING EVERY SINGLE POLLING PLACE. </p><p> </p><p>-- UNLIKE WITH PREVIOUS PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS, THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT PLANS TO CONDUCT THE NEXT ELECTION ON A </p><p>CONSTITUENCY BASIS, RATHER THAN ALLOWING VOTERS TO VOTE </p><p>ANYWHERE IN THE COUNTRY.  IF A VOTER HAS MOVED TO A </p><p>DIFFERENT CONSTITUENCY FROM WHERE HE LAST VOTED (AND </p><p>MANY HAVE), HE IS REQUIRED TO REREGISTER.  MANY RURAL </p><p>VOTERS WILL NOT DO SO BECAUSE THEY CANNOT AFFORD THE </p><p>HIGH COST OF BUSFARE TO THE REGISTRATION SITE, OR THEY </p><p>DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE NECESSITY OF REREGISTERING.  MOST </p><p>WILL NOT TRAVEL LONG DISTANCES TO VOTE IN THEIR OLD </p><p>CONSTITUENCY, EITHER, ACCORDING TO RASMUSSEN.  THIS </p><p>COULD ALSO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE LARGE </p><p>NUMBERS OF URBAN VOTERS REGISTERED IN RURAL AREAS WHO </p><p>SUPPORT THE MDC.  HOLDING THE ELECTION ON A CONSTITUENCY </p><p>BASIS WILL ALSO ALLOW PRESIDENTIAL SUPPORTERS TO TARGET </p><p>ANTI-MUGABE CONSTITUENCIES FOR VIOLENCE, INTIMIDATION, </p><p>AND FRAUD. </p><p> </p><p>KEEP THE DIRTY BUSINESS OUT OF SIGHT </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01178  03 OF 05  301231Z </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) PRESIDENT MUGABE WILL MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO KEEP </p><p>HIS TRANSGRESSIONS OUT OF SIGHT--JUST AS HE DID DURING </p><p>THE MATABELELAND REPRESSIONS OF THE MID-1980S--KNOWING </p><p>THAT WIDELY PUBLICIZED FRAUD OR INTIMIDATION DURING THE </p><p>ELECTION WILL TARNISH HIS LEGITIMACY.  TWO FOREIGN </p><p>JOURNALISTS HAVE ALREADY BEEN EXPELLED THIS YEAR, AND </p><p>NEW REGULATIONS UNDER CONSIDERATION WILL MAKE IT </p><p>DIFFICULT FOR MANY FOREIGN JOURNALISTS TO REPORT OVERTLY </p><p>ON THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION FROM ZIMBABWE(REF B). </p><p>MUGABE HAS TOLD THE LOCAL DIPLOMATIC CORPS THAT THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY SHOULD NOT INTERFERE IN </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S INTERNAL AFFAIRS AND SUGGESTED THAT ITS </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES WOULD NOT BE PERMITTED TO OBSERVE THE </p><p>UPCOMING ELECTION (REF D).  DESPITE THIS STATEMENT, THE </p><p>PRESIDENT WILL LIKELY ALLOW MONITORS FROM INTERNATIONAL </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS LIKE SADC AND THE OAU TO MAINTAIN THE </p><p>CHARADE OF TRANSPARENCY, BUT HE IS LIKELY TO RAISE EVERY </p><p>KIND OF ADMINISTRATIVE OBSTACLE TO OTHER INTERNATIONAL </p><p>(ESPECIALLY WESTERN) OBSERVERS SO AS TO LIMIT THEIR </p><p>NUMBERS.  DOMESTIC MONITORS WILL FIND THEIR ACTIVITIES </p><p>HAMPERED AS WELL, PARTICULARLY IN REMOTE AREAS, </p><p>INCLUDING BY THE SETTING UP OF ROADBLOCKS AND </p><p>DIFFICULTIES WITH ACCREDITATION.  BECAUSE THERE ARE </p><p>NORMALLY 5,000 POLLING STATIONS IN ZIMBABWE\'S NATIONAL </p><p>ELECTIONS, LIMITING THE NUMBERS AND ACTIVITIES OF </p><p>MONITORS WILL BE CRITICAL TO CARRYING OUT ELECTORAL </p><p>FRAUD THAT COULD SKEW THE RESULTS IN MUGABE\'S FAVOR. </p><p> </p><p>MUGABE COULD LEGALLY SCRAP THE RESULTS </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  01178  03 OF 05  301231Z </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) IF IT APPEARS MUGABE\'S VOTE TALLY WOULD FALL </p><p>SLIGHTLY SHORT OF HIS OPPONENT\'S (TSVANGIRAI WOULD NEED </p><p>ONLY ONE MORE VOTE THAN MUGABE TO WIN OUTRIGHT IN THE </p><p>STRAIGHT HEAD COUNT), THE PRESIDENT WOULD LIKELY </p><p>POSTPONE ANNOUNCING THE RESULTS SO THAT HE WOULD HAVE </p><p>TIME TO RIG THE OUTCOME.  IF IT APPEARED THAT THE MARGIN </p><p>WAS TOO GREAT AND HE COULD NOT CREDIBLY POSTPONE THE </p><p>ANNOUNCEMENT, HE WOULD LIKELY ANNUL THE ELECTION, CHARGE </p><p>THE OPPOSITION WITH FRAUD, AND ANNOUNCE A NEW ELECTION </p><p>IN A FEW WEEKS\' TIME TO BEAT THE CONSTITUTIONAL DEADLINE </p><p>OF MARCH 31.  (NOTE: MUGABE COULD CONCEIVABLY CALL A NEW </p><p>ELECTION AFTER THIS DATE, BUT THIS COULD BE SUBJECT TO </p><p>LEGAL CHALLENGES AND COULD UNDERMINE THE LEGITIMACY OF </p><p>THE ELECTION.

(C) AS A LAST RESORT, THE PRESIDENT COULD INVOKE A </p><p>NUMBER OF EMERGENCY POWERS UNDER THE LAW IF IT APPEARED </p><p>THE PUBLIC WOULD NOT ACCEPT HIS RE-ELECTION OR THE </p><p>ANNULMENT OF THE RESULTS.  GIVEN MUGABE\'S DEEP </p><p>UNPOPULARITY IN THE CITIES AND THE PUBLIC\'S EAGER </p><p>ANTICIPATION OF A CHANGE IN LEADERSHIP, LARGE-SCALE </p><p>URBAN DEMONSTRATIONS WOULD BE A STRONG POSSIBILITY. </p><p>(NOTE: THIS SCENARIO COULD ALSO ARISE IF MDC PRESIDENT </p><p>MORGAN TSVANGIRAI IS FOUND GUILTY OF INCITING VIOLENCE </p><p>AND BARRED FROM RUNNING FOR THE PRESIDENCY.  SEE REF E. </p><p>THE HIGH COURT IS SCHEDULED TO HEAR HIS CASE ON APRIL </p><p>30.  END NOTE.)  UNDER THE PRESIDENTIAL POWERS </p><p>(TEMPORARY MEASURES) ACT, THE PRESIDENT CAN "MAKE URGENT </p><p>REGULATIONS" IF "A SITUATION HAS ARISEN OR IS LIKELY TO </p><p>ARISE" THAT THREATENS PUBLIC SAFETY OR ORDER, OR CANNOT </p><p>"AWAIT THE PASSAGE THROUGH PARLIAMENT OF AN ACT DEALING </p><p>WITH THE SITUATION."  THESE REGULATIONS WOULD BE VALID </p><p>FOR SIX MONTHS, AND COULD BE USED TO IMPLEMENT A MASSIVE </p><p>CRACKDOWN ON DEMONSTRATORS AND OPPOSITION ACTIVITIES. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) IF THE SITUATION PROVED MORE THREATENING, THE </p><p>PRESIDENT COULD, UNDER THE CONSTITUTION, DECLARE A STATE </p><p>OF EMERGENCY, WHICH IS VALID FOR 14 DAYS.  IF PARLIAMENT </p><p>RATIFIES IT IN THAT TIMEFRAME, IT WOULD BECOME VALID FOR </p><p>SIX MONTHS.  THE EMERGENCY POWERS ACT SPECIFIES THAT </p><p>UNDER A STATE OF EMERGENCY, THE PRESIDENT CAN ISSUE </p><p>REGULATIONS THAT PROVIDE FOR THE SUMMARY ARREST AND </p><p>DETENTION OF PERSONS THREATENING PUBLIC SAFETY, THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01178  04 OF 05  301231Z </p><p>DEPORTATION OF ANY NON-CITIZEN, THE SEIZING OF ANY </p><p>PROPERTY, AND THE SEARCHING OF ANY PREMISES.  UNDER THE </p><p>MOST EXTREME CIRCUMSTANCES, IN WHICH HIS CONTINUED RULE </p><p>IS THREATENED BY UNRULY MOBS, MUGABE COULD DECLARE </p><p>MARTIAL LAW, A BROAD POWER GIVEN HIM BY THE CONSTITUTION </p><p>THAT WOULD NOT REQUIRE PARLIAMENTARY APPROVAL OR BE </p><p>SUBJECT TO TIME LIMITS. </p><p> </p><p>MILITARY SUPPORT WILL BE KEY </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) SHOULD THE POST-ELECTION PERIOD DEGENERATE INTO </p><p>WIDESPREAD UNREST, THE MILITARY\'S SUPPORT OF MUGABE WILL </p><p>BE KEY TO HIS CONTINUED RULE.  ALL INDICATIONS ARE THAT </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S MILITARY WILL BACK PRESIDENT MUGABE\'S RE- </p><p>ELECTION, EVEN IF IT APPEARS ILLEGITIMATE.  ACCORDING TO </p><p>QUINTANA, THE DEFENSE CONSULTANT, THE ARMY AND AIR FORCE </p><p>ARE "COMPLETELY IN BED WITH MUGABE AND COMPANY."  AS </p><p>RECENTLY AS EARLY LAST YEAR, THE MILITARY WAS LARGELY </p><p>AMBIVALENT ABOUT MUGABE\'S ELECTION TACTICS, AND SOME </p><p>LOWER-LEVEL OFFICERS VOICED DISMAY THAT THEY WERE ASKED </p><p>TO DELIVER THE VOTE FOR ZANU-PF.  NOW, ALL THAT HAS </p><p>CHANGED, QUINTANA REMARKED.  MUGABE HAS BOUGHT THE </p><p>LOYALTY OF NEARLY ALL OFFICERS BY LETTING THEM PICK OUT </p><p>CHOICE PARCELS OF LAND--ORIGINALLY DESIGNATED FOR </p><p>RESETTLEMENT--FOR THEIR OWN USE.  THE LEVEL OF </p><p>CORRUPTION HAS INCREASED MARKEDLY, AND NEARLY "EVERYONE </p><p>IS OPENLY CORRUPT."  "A COUP D\'ETAT IS SIMPLY NOT </p><p>POSSIBLE," THE CONSULTANT OPINED. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C) PRESIDENT MUGABE RELIES ON HIS SPECIAL FORCES </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  01178  04 OF 05  301231Z </p><p>MORE THAN EVER, ACCORDING TO QUINTANA.  UNITS LIKE THE </p><p>PARACHUTE BATTALION AND PRESIDENTIAL GUARD ARE MORE </p><p>FREQUENTLY CALLED UPON TO CARRY OUT SPECIAL TASKS, SUCH </p><p>AS THE BEATING OF CHITUNGWIZA RESIDENTS.  BECAUSE OF </p><p>THEIR GREATER DISCIPLINE AND LOYALTY, THEY WOULD ALSO BE </p><p>CALLED UPON TO PROTECT THE PRESIDENT SHOULD CROWDS </p><p>DESCEND ON STATE HOUSE, QUINTANA STATED.  THEY LEARNED </p><p>AT COURSES IN CHINA THAT "IF YOU KILL ONE PERSON, YOU </p><p>WILL FRIGHTEN A THOUSAND;" THE SPECIAL UNITS WOULD NOT </p><p>HESITATE TO FIRE ON THREATENING DEMONSTRATORS TO KEEP </p><p>MUGABE IN POWER, QUINTANA OPINED.  THE MILITARY WOULD BE </p><p>EVEN MORE LIKELY TO FIRE ON CROWDS IF THERE ARE NO </p><p>INTERNATIONAL NEWS CREWS TO RECORD THE EVENT. </p><p> </p><p>MUGABE WILL GO ONLY UNDER SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C) THERE IS ONLY ONE CASE IN WHICH THE MILITARY </p><p>WOULD TURN ON MUGABE, QUINTANA OFFERED, AND THAT WOULD </p><p>BE IF THE BULLETS RAN OUT BEFORE THE PEOPLE DID.  IF A </p><p>CROWD OF 100,000 DESCENDED ON STATE HOUSE, FOR INSTANCE, </p><p>AND THEY DID NOT DISPERSE AFTER A LARGE NUMBER WERE </p><p>KILLED, IT IS CONCEIVABLE THAT THE MILITARY LEADERSHIP </p><p>WOULD GO TO MUGABE AND TELL HIM THAT THEY COULD NO </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ6654 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  01178  05 OF 05  301231Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DINT-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00 </p><p>      DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00   FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00    H-01 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    DCP-01   NSAE-00 </p><p>      OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00 </p><p>      SP-00    IRM-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-01 </p><p>      DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /008W </p><p>                  ------------------D95222  301232Z /38 </p><p>P 301234Z MAR 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 8545 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>SECDEF WASHINGTON DC </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 05 OF 05 HARARE 001178 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>SECDEF FOR OSD/SA </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR CHARLES GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/30/11 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINR, PINS, MCAP, ZI </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  01178  05 OF 05  301231Z </p><p>SUBJECT: ZIMBABWE: HOW PRESIDENT MUGABE WILL HANG ON TO </p><p>POWER </p><p> </p><p>LONGER PROTECT HIM, AND ASK HIM TO RESIGN.  IN THAT </p><p>CASE, MUGABE PROBABLY WOULD STEP DOWN, QUINTANA </p><p>BELIEVES.  THIS IS A VERY UNLIKELY SCENARIO, HOWEVER, </p><p>BECAUSE THE NUMBER OF PROTESTERS REQUIRED WOULD BE FAR </p><p>MORE THAN ZIMBABWE HAS EVER SEEN, THE CONSULTANT </p><p>AVERRED. </p><p> </p><p>15.  (C) BY OUR RECKONING, THERE IS ONE OTHER </p><p>CIRCUMSTANCE UNDER WHICH MUGABE MIGHT VOLUNTARILY LEAVE </p><p>OFFICE.  IF HIS HEALTH DECLINES SIGNIFICANTLY BY THE END </p><p>OF THE YEAR, HE MAY DECIDE TO ANOINT A SUCCESSOR-- </p><p>PROBABLY EMMERSON MNANGAGWA--TO RUN AS ZANU-PF\'S </p><p>CANDIDATE (REF A).  (NOTE: THERE HAVE LONG BEEN RUMORS </p><p>OF MUGABE\'S DECLINING HEALTH, WHICH HAVE BEEN RIDICULED </p><p>BY GOVERNMENT SPOKESMEN BUT NOT FLATLY DENIED.  RECENT, </p><p>PERSISTENT REPORTS OF MUGABE FREQUENTLY FALLING DOWN </p><p>LEND CREDENCE TO THE NOTION THAT HE HAS A SERIOUS HEALTH </p><p>CONDITION.  END NOTE.)  HE MAY ALSO DECIDE TO STEP DOWN </p><p>SHORTLY AFTER WINNING RE-ELECTION AND ALLOW A VICE- </p><p>PRESIDENT TO SUCCEED HIM, CONFIDENT IN THE KNOWLEDGE </p><p>THAT HIS PHYSICAL AND FINANCIAL SECURITY WOULD BE </p><p>PROTECTED. </p><p> </p><p>CONCLUSION </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>16.  (C) BARRING ANY UNFORESEEN DEVELOPMENTS, IT IS OUR </p><p>ASSESSMENT THAT MUGABE WILL WIN RE-ELECTION AND WILL </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01178  05 OF 05  301231Z </p><p>INVOKE A HOST OF LEGAL MEASURES, BACKED BY THE MILITARY, </p><p>TO OVERCOME ANY POPULAR BACKLASH.  MUGABE STILL VALUES </p><p>THE STAMP OF LEGITIMACY THAT AN ELECTION CONVEYS TO THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, AND WILL DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE </p><p>TO ENSURE THAT THE ELECTORATE MAKES THE "CORRECT" </p><p>CHOICE.  THE PRESIDENT WILL USE EXTRAORDINARY MEASURES, </p><p>SUCH AS A STATE OF EMERGENCY OR MARTIAL LAW, AS A LAST </p><p>RESORT.  IT DOES NOT APPEAR THAT THE OPPOSITION OR CIVIL </p><p>SOCIETY HAS THE WHEREWITHAL OR ORGANIZATIONAL ABILITY AT </p><p>THIS TIME TO OVERCOME PRESIDENT MUGABE\'S CONSIDERABLE </p><p>ADVANTAGES AS INCUMBENT, DESPITE HIS LACK OF POPULARITY. </p><p>MUGABE\'S RELENTLESS ELECTIONEERING MAY EVEN TURN AROUND </p><p>HIS SAGGING POPULARITY IN TRADTIONAL ZANU-PF AREAS. </p><p> </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
