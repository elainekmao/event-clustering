<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 05 TEGUCIGALPA 002746 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR S, D, P, WHA, EB, CA, INL, DRL, PM, AND WHA/CEN </p><p>NSC FOR AMB MAISTO </p><p>STATE PASS AID FOR LAC/CEN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/30/2012 </p><p>TAGS: OVIP, PREL, PGOV, ETRD, PTER, SNAR, PHUM, ELAB, HO </p><p>SUBJECT: SCENESETTER FOR SECRETARY POWELL\'S VISIT TO </p><p>HONDURAS OCTOBER 10-11 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: CHARGE D\'AFFAIRES, A.I., ROGER PIERCE; REASONS 1.5 (B) A </p><p>ND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary.  Honduran President Ricardo Maduro, only in </p><p>office since January, faces numerous challenges in one of the </p><p>poorest and most corrupt countries in the Western Hemisphere. </p><p> His Administration has been stalled on its domestic agenda </p><p>since June as it tries to reconcile its ambitious goals to </p><p>its straitjacketed financial situation.  Bilateral relations </p><p>between the U.S. and Honduras are excellent; Honduras was the </p><p>first country in Central America (and the second in Latin </p><p>America) to sign an ICC Article 98 Agreement with the U.S. </p><p>and its support for the international counterterrorism effort </p><p>is steadfast.  The United States and Honduras have maintained </p><p>a longstanding close relationship framed by such events as </p><p>the establishment of the banana plantations in the late </p><p>1800s, the Contra wars of the 1980s, and reconstruction </p><p>efforts in the wake of the October 1998 fury of Hurricane </p><p>Mitch.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Key Issues in Bilateral Relationship </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) The central themes in our bilateral diplomatic </p><p>efforts in Honduras are combating international crime by </p><p>strengthening governance and attacking corruption, assisting </p><p>American citizens, fostering economic development, promoting </p><p>regional stability, promoting trade and investment, and </p><p>combating terrorism.  However, the underlying difficulty to </p><p>realizing USG objectives is improving the administration of </p><p>justice and rule of law.  President Ricardo Maduro,s </p><p>government is fully engaged on all of these issues, supports </p><p>judicial and political reform, and is seeking to transform </p><p>Honduras so that law and order can be restored and economic </p><p>growth ignited.  He faces formidable challenges from </p><p>entrenched economic and political interests in moving his </p><p>agenda forward. </p><p> </p><p>Status of the Maduro Government </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) President Maduro is facing increasing criticism from </p><p>the political opposition over his government,s policies and </p><p>continued dissatisfaction from his own party,s Members of </p><p>Congress because of his Administration,s technocratic style. </p><p> The Honduran Congress is a focal point of political </p><p>opposition to his policies.  It is a corrupt institution </p><p>riddled with avaricious politicians, and Maduro\'s National </p><p>Party does not control a majority of the unicameral body. </p><p>The ongoing problems within his own party are serious and </p><p>threaten his broader political agenda, which will require </p><p>legislation to advance.  Continuing political negotiations </p><p>will be needed to manage this situation.  Maduro,s personal </p><p>life is also intruding into the political sphere.  His </p><p>imminent wedding to a Spaniard has been criticized by many </p><p>Hondurans who view the President as distracted by his </p><p>personal life. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Your meeting with President Maduro is well-timed to </p><p>give his Presidency a needed lift.  The President,s standing </p><p>has remained stalled at a low point since June.  Faced with </p><p>slow progress in his efforts to promote regional economic </p><p>integration, Maduro,s team is pinning its hopes that a </p><p>U.S.-Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) can serve </p><p>as a catalyst to regional economic cooperation.  Maduro is </p><p>also beginning to hear wider disillusionment among the </p><p>Honduran public as violent crime levels are increasing once </p><p>again despite his successful initial "zero tolerance" law and </p><p>order campaign.  Notwithstanding his crackdown on street </p><p>crime, actual ongoing criminal investigations, in particular </p><p>homicides, remain stalled. </p><p> </p><p>Counterterrorism Cooperation </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Maduro is a good and reliable friend of the U.S. on </p><p>counterterrorism.  His government hosted a major U.S. </p><p>military counterterrorism exercise in March and has quickly </p><p>responded with freeze orders to all U.S. requests regarding </p><p>suspect terrorist bank accounts.  No terrorist assets have </p><p>been found in Honduran financial institutions, to date.  The </p><p>GOH still needs to take the following concrete steps: </p><p>designate a national coordinator for counterterrorism, file </p><p>its national report in accordance with United Nations </p><p>Security Council (UNSC) Resolution 1373, and most of all, </p><p>sign and/or ratify the seven outstanding international </p><p>conventions/protocols and two OAS conventions (1971 and 2002) </p><p>against terrorism. </p><p> </p><p>Iraq </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) While the GOH is in general supportive of key USG </p><p>foreign policy goals, the Ministry of Foreign Relations </p><p>appears hesitant to be out front supporting the USG position </p><p>on Iraq.  MFA officials have privately voiced concern that </p><p>they believe that the USG needs to work harder on gaining </p><p>multilateral support at the United Nations.  Without UNSC or </p><p>Rio Group consensus the GOH is not yet willing to make a </p><p>public statement backing U.S. policy on Iraq.  However the </p><p>U.S. should be able to count on Honduras\' support when a </p><p>final decision is taken. </p><p> </p><p>Anti-corruption </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) The new U.S. policy against corruption struck a </p><p>nerve in Honduras, especially any mention of our new visa </p><p>revocation authorities.  Politicians in Congress and certain </p><p>business elements feel the U.S. is attacking them.  Maduro is </p><p>committed to addressing corruption, even if it will cost him </p><p>political support within his party.  The Supreme Court </p><p>President is also on board.  Given the scope of the problem, </p><p>any public discussion about the country,s pervasive </p><p>corruption is a positive development. </p><p> </p><p>Supreme Court and Judicial Reform </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) The Supreme Court is developing into an independent </p><p>branch of power, unlike all of its predecessor courts since </p><p>democracy was restored in 1982.  It is pro-reform in </p><p>orientation and fighting for its prerogatives.  In some </p><p>respects, the development of the court in Honduras, restored </p><p>democracy is approaching its "Marbury v. Madison" moment. </p><p>The emerging issue is whether it can become a fully </p><p>independent and co-equal branch of political power, </p><p>consistent with the separation of powers provision in the </p><p>Honduran Constitution.  The established political order is </p><p>fighting that prospect with all its might.  In fact, the </p><p>Congress recently seized the political opportunity to </p><p>introduce legislation that would give itself the power to </p><p>interpret the constitutionality of the laws its passes. </p><p> </p><p>Public Security/Human Rights </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) Upon taking office on January 27 President Maduro,s </p><p>first act was to fulfill his main campaign promise - a zero </p><p>tolerance campaign against the country,s out-of-control </p><p>crime situation.  He deployed more than 5,000 soldiers to the </p><p>streets to support the police.  The public responded </p><p>enthusiastically.  However, despite the initial success of </p><p>establishing a visible police presence, violent crime, </p><p>particularly kidnappings, has only fallen marginally.  Public </p><p>support is fading and the campaign needs some visible </p><p>victories to restore confidence in the government,s program. </p><p> We are helping the Maduro government establish an </p><p>anti-kidnapping unit, increase intake/training of police </p><p>recruits, create a model tourist police force, boost its </p><p>counternarcotics efforts, and expand the frontier police. </p><p>The country\'s geographic position makes it an obvious </p><p>strategic transit point for narcotics trafficking, alien </p><p>smuggling operations and other organized crime activities. </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) Extradjudicial killings, especially of </p><p>children/young adults between 1998-2001, have been a source </p><p>of serious concern and only recently has the GOH begun to </p><p>take steps to investigate the hundreds of unsolved cases. </p><p>There has been some discussion of the establishment of a </p><p>Truth Commission to look into unresolved alleged human rights </p><p>abuses from the 1980s.  There are serious problems with child </p><p>labor in several industries, particularly melon, coffee, and </p><p>shrimp (but not the maquila) sectors, and trafficking in </p><p>persons of women/children for prostitution in the U.S. and </p><p>children for commercial sexual exploitation in Central </p><p>America.  USAID and Peace Corps have both been involved in </p><p>HIV/AIDS prevention. </p><p> </p><p>Consular Issues </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU) Some 500,000 Hondurans, both legal and illegal, </p><p>live in the U.S., a fact that places immigration issues high </p><p>on the bilateral agenda.  There is deep appreciation for the </p><p>Administration\'s extension of Temporary Protected Status </p><p>(TPS) in the U.S. and interest in possible congressional </p><p>action on the pending Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central </p><p>American Relief Act (NACARA), which would give immigration </p><p>parity for Hondurans.  With fourteen thousand American </p><p>citizens residing in Honduras and many thousands visiting </p><p>Honduras annually for tourism and business American Citizen </p><p>Services are a key part of the Embassy\'s work.  There is </p><p>little progress in any of the now more than 30 American </p><p>citizen murder cases.  In the last year the GOH has increased </p><p>cooperation with the Embassy on these cases, including </p><p>establishing two prosecutors.  However, little progress has </p><p>been made on extradition cases involving American Citizens </p><p>wanted for felonies in the U.S. </p><p> </p><p>Border Relations </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>12. (SBU) Honduras has border disputes with its three Central </p><p>American land neighbors and its seven maritime neighbors. </p><p>Maduro is personally engaged with his Presidential </p><p>counterparts to address these issues.  Its land and maritime </p><p>disputes with El Salvador and Nicaragua are the most heated. </p><p>The Gulf of Fonseca on the Pacific coast is a particularly </p><p>difficult point.  A 1992 International Court of Justice (ICJ) </p><p>ruling laid out shared areas of control in the Gulf of </p><p>Fonseca and established the land border between Honduras and </p><p>El Salvador, although El Salvador has been slow to implement </p><p>the ruling.  In September of this year El Salvador raised </p><p>issues related to the 1992 ruling to the ICJ for </p><p>clarification. </p><p> </p><p>13. (SBU) On the Caribbean coast, Honduras and Nicaragua have </p><p>a long-standing maritime border dispute over the 15th </p><p>parallel.   Honduras provoked Nicaraguan retaliation when it </p><p>signed a maritime treaty with Colombia recognizing the 15th </p><p>parallel as its maritime border in 1999.  Nicaragua filed an </p><p>ICJ case over the maritime border and more importantly in </p><p>1999 slapped a punitive 35 per cent tariff on Honduran goods </p><p>that remains in place despite a Central American Court of </p><p>Justice ruling that it is illegal.  With former Nicaraguan </p><p>President Arnoldo Aleman deposed as President of the National </p><p>Assembly, GOH officials have expressed renewed optimism that </p><p>Nicaraguan President Enrique Bolanos will make good on </p><p>private assurances to lift the tariff and thereby take an </p><p>important step forward toward regional economic integration. </p><p>You may wish to compliment Maduro on the GOH,s restraint and </p><p>note that the regional integration benefits of a CAFTA with </p><p>the U.S. (as well as other integration efforts) will be </p><p>undermined by a trade war. </p><p> </p><p>Troubled Economy Endangers IMF Program and HIPC Debt Relief </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p> </p><p>14. (SBU) President Maduro may ask you for assistance in </p><p>convincing Paris Club creditors to be patient, IMF officials </p><p>to be lenient, and donors to agree to changes in the Highly </p><p>Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) rules on accounting for </p><p>poverty reduction programs.  President Maduro inherited a </p><p>stagnating economy and seriously deteriorated government </p><p>finances from the previous government.  The GOH missed all </p><p>key International Monetary Fund (IMF) targets in 2001.  Even </p><p>after the Maduro economic team won passage of austerity and </p><p>tax measures in May of this year, the government,s budget </p><p>deficit is still expected to be a high 5.9 percent of GDP. </p><p>The IMF is skeptical that the GOH will undertake the </p><p>meaningful and long overdue reforms needed to work out a new </p><p>three-year program.  An IMF team arrives in October. </p><p> </p><p>15. (SBU) International Financial Institution (IFI) and </p><p>bilateral donor disbursements will be held up until the new </p><p>IMF program is in place.  There could also be pressure on GOH </p><p>Paris Club debt service payments (USD 100 million per year). </p><p>In the meantime, the completion point for HIPC debt reduction </p><p>(worth USD 900 million) continues to slip back further. </p><p>Ultimately, this fiscal situation could impact Honduras, </p><p>eligibility for Millennium Fund grants. </p><p> </p><p>16. (SBU) The Honduran economy is growing slowly (estimated </p><p>real GDP growth of 1.8 percent this year).  Low world coffee </p><p>prices continue to hurt the economy in rural areas. </p><p>Inflation continues to decrease slowly, estimated at 8-9 </p><p>percent in 2002.  The currency is depreciating at a rate of </p><p>about five percent per year.  The economy is dominated by </p><p>agriculture - particularly the production of coffee, bananas </p><p>and cultivated shrimp - although the in-bond apparel assembly </p><p>industry has grown dramatically over the past decade and </p><p>remittances, from Hondurans living overseas, continues to </p><p>grow rapidly (up 38 percent in the first six months of this </p><p>year) and have become the most important source of foreign </p><p>exchange.  The U.S. is Honduras\' largest trading partner; </p><p>roughly 150 U.S. companies do business here.  While many </p><p>social indicators are improving, two-thirds of all Hondurans </p><p>live in poverty and average educational levels are very low. </p><p> </p><p>17. (SBU) Maduro will probably express gratitude for a </p><p>Treasury Department technical assistance project on tax </p><p>collection and enforcement, partially supported by USAID. </p><p>While modest in scope, the GOH is excited about its potential </p><p>to strengthen its tax service and help deter tax evasion. </p><p> </p><p>U.S.-Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) Critical </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p> </p><p>18. (SBU) Maduro has personally identified himself with a </p><p>CAFTA as his government\'s principal trade objective.  The </p><p>Minister of Industry and Trade is reorganizing the Ministry </p><p>(historically fairly weak) and adding staff in a belated </p><p>effort to get ready for the negotiations.  The Maduro </p><p>administration has also been more cooperative with the U.S. </p><p>in the World Trade Organization (WTO) in Geneva.  Honduras </p><p>(along with other Central American countries) has been </p><p>supportive in the FTAA ministerials but to date has not taken </p><p>an active role in the negotiating groups. </p><p> </p><p>19. (SBU) Latent protectionism exists in the private sector, </p><p>but the general attitude toward a free trade agreement in </p><p>Honduras is positive.  The textile and apparel industry in </p><p>particular believes an FTA is the only way that the Honduran </p><p>apparel sector can survive the elimination of quotas in 2005 </p><p>and compete with Asian manufacturers. </p><p> </p><p>U.S. Investment Faces Problems </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>20. (SBU) The Maduro government understands that Honduras </p><p>needs foreign (and domestic) investment to spur economic </p><p>growth but has placed emphasis on the more immediate problems </p><p>of political and judicial reforms, the fiscal deficit, and </p><p>needed improvements in security, education and health. </p><p>Maduro will tout a new law on simplification of </p><p>administrative procedures and formation of a national </p><p>competitiveness council, headed by Vice President Vicente </p><p>Williams, to enhance the investment climate at all levels of </p><p>society.  The government has identified tourism, </p><p>agrobusiness, forestry, and mining as important sectors that </p><p>could create much-needed jobs. </p><p> </p><p>21. (SBU) Much more needs to be done to declare Honduras </p><p>"open for business."  Maduro needs to find a way to get his </p><p>cabinet (and the prickly legislative and executive branches) </p><p>to make meaningful changes that will resolve the key </p><p>problems: poor and expensive infrastructure; weak legal </p><p>system; personal security, education and health conditions; </p><p>land tenure problems; and opposition to large foreign </p><p>investments by well-connected vested interests. </p><p> </p><p>22. (SBU) The Honduran government has stalled in its past </p><p>efforts to liberalize and privatize the electricity and </p><p>telecommunications markets.  We are closely following the </p><p>pending tender by the National Electric Energy Company (ENEE) </p><p>to purchase 210 mega-watts of electricity starting 2004.  If </p><p>U.S. company AES is successful in this bid and its efforts to </p><p>build a combined cycle plant in Puerto Cortes, we expect a </p><p>big spur to regional integration and investment in light </p><p>manufacturing and assembly in Honduras.  The GOH,s telecom </p><p>regulatory agency is also bidding out a second cellular phone </p><p>license this year; two U.S. companies have applied during the </p><p>pre-qualification stage.  The GOH has requested USG policy </p><p>support for liberalization of the telecom (through the Trade </p><p>and Development Agency) and power (through USAID) sectors. </p><p>However, in order to make these long overdue structural </p><p>reforms a reality, the Maduro government must follow through </p><p>on its commitments. </p><p> </p><p>23. (SBU) Land tenure problems (combined with a weak judicial </p><p>system) are endemic in Honduras, and undermine efforts to </p><p>develop the tourism, agriculture and forestry sectors.  They </p><p>also deter new investments in a variety of other sectors. </p><p>The Embassy has files on 112 property dispute cases </p><p>(generally squatter/land reform cases and title disputes), of </p><p>which 32 are active.  There are an additional 68 commercial </p><p>disputes, of which 14 are currently active.  The GOH plans to </p><p>introduce a law allowing some of the land cases to be </p><p>submitted to arbitration and is working on an improved </p><p>property registry system. </p><p> </p><p>24. (SBU) These will be important steps, but much more is </p><p>needed.  The GOH and Supreme Court need to ensure that the </p><p>judicial system provides effective responses to commercial </p><p>and investment disputes and violations of property rights. </p><p> </p><p>Money Laundering and Bank Failures </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>25. (SBU) Strengthened money laundering legislation, with an </p><p>antiterrorist financing clause, was the first law to be </p><p>adopted by the new Congress in late February of this year. </p><p>The fragility of the financial system remains a key concern. </p><p>The GOH took over the two most troubled banks in May 2002, </p><p>arranged for the absorption of a third undercapitalized bank </p><p>and is actively promoting mergers among the remaining 20 </p><p>private banks.  Although the Maduro government has managed </p><p>the financial sector issue well, massive challenges remain. </p><p>A World Bank/IMF review of the financial sector is underway. </p><p> </p><p>Embassy Tegucigalpa </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>26. (SBU) Embassy Tegucigalpa is a medium-sized post, </p><p>employing 140 U.S. citizens and 300 Hondurans among 20 USG </p><p>agencies.  Our Peace Corps program, with more than 220 </p><p>volunteers, is one of the world\'s largest, and the USAID </p><p>mission had a FY02 budget of USD 34.5 million.  The Mission </p><p>maintains a Consular Agent in Honduras\' second city and </p><p>industrial center, San Pedro Sula.  Five-hundred and fifty </p><p>U.S. service men and women are stationed at Honduras\' Soto </p><p>Cano Airbase under the auspices of U.S. Southern Command as </p><p>Joint Task Force Bravo.  In 1954, the USG and GOH signed a </p><p>Bilateral Military Assistance Agreement that set forth their </p><p>intention to work closely together to foster peace and </p><p>security in the Western Hemisphere.  The ICC Article 98 </p><p>Agreement with Honduras is therefore a particularly important </p><p>accomplishment, and will enable our military forces to </p><p>continue to work together in such areas as disaster recovery, </p><p>joint training exercises, and counternarcotics missions. </p><p>PIERCE </p><p></p></div>
