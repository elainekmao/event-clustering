(C) SUMMARY: IN DEMARCHES ON SENIOR GOI OFFICIALS OCTOBER </p><p>8-10, DCM, ECMIN, AGMIN AND SCIENCE COUNSELOR PRESSED THE </p><p>U.S. POSITION ON EU TRACEABILITY AND LABELING (T/L) AND FOOD </p><p>AND FEED (F/F) PROPOSALS.  EMPHASIZING THAT THE UPCOMING </p><p>AGRICULTURE MINISTERS COUNCIL AND ENVIRONMENT MINISTERS </p><p>COUNCIL WOULD BE OF KEY IMPORTANCE, THEY ASKED THAT ITALY </p><p>TAKE MORE REASONABLE, SCIENCE-BASED POSITIONS (REF A) IN BOTH </p><p>MEETINGS.  DESPITE UNDERSTANDING FOR OUR POSITION IN SEVERAL </p><p>PARTS OF THE GOVERNMENT, GOI BIOTECH POLICY CONTINUES TO BE </p><p>DRIVEN BY THE OBSTRUCTIONIST MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE. END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>VICE MINISTER FOR FOREIGN TRADE URSO </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) ECMIN MET OCTOBER 8 WITH DEPUTY MINISTER OF FOREIGN </p><p>TRADE ADOLFO URSO.  HE TOLD URSO THAT, ALTHOUGH PRIME </p><p>MINISTER BERLUSCONI AND OTHER GOI OFFICIALS HAD SPOKEN IN </p><p>FAVOR OF BIOTECHNOLOGY, WE WERE DISAPPOINTED THAT AGRICULTURE </p><p>MINISTER ALEMANNO CONTINUED HIS ANTI-BIOTECH CAMPAIGN </p><p>UNCHECKED.  ECMIN POINTED TO RECENT GOI/USG COOPERATION ON </p><p>THE WHEAT MARGIN OF PREFERENCE ISSUE AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW THE </p><p>U.S. AND ITALY COULD WORK TOGETHER EVEN ON AGRICULTURE </p><p>ISSUES.  WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE SIMILAR DIALOGUE AND </p><p>COOPERATION ON BIOTECHNOLOGY. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  04989  01 OF 02  111704Z </p><p>3. (C) A MORE COHERENT, FLEXIBLE GOI POSITION WOULD BE VERY </p><p>IMPORTANT FOR THE EU AGRICULTURE AND ENVIRONMENT COUNCIL </p><p>MEETINGS OCTOBER 15-17. STRESSING THAT THE U.S. HAD WORKED TO </p><p>NARROW OUR REQUESTS FOR CHANGES IN THE T/L AND F/F PROPOSALS </p><p>TO A FEW CRUCIAL POINTS, ECMIN ASKED THAT URSO RAISE OUR </p><p>CONCERNS WITH HIS COLLEAGUES. </p><p> </p><p>4.(C)  URSO NOTED THAT MANY IN THE GOI, INCLUDING THE PRIME </p><p>MINISTER, DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER -- AND URSO HIMSELF -- WERE </p><p>QUITE OPEN ON BIOTECHNOLOGY.  HOWEVER, THE MINISTERS MOST </p><p>INVOLVED IN SETTING BIOTECH POLICY WERE AGRICULTURE MINISTER </p><p>ALEMANNO AND ENVIRONMENT MINISTER MATTEOLI.  URSO UNDERSTOOD </p><p>THE U.S. POINTS, AND UNDERTOOK TO DISCUSS THEM WITH MINISTER </p><p>ALEMANNO, DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER FINI AND THE PRIME MINISTER\'S </p><p>OFFICE. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) URSO ALSO COMMENTED THAT, A FEW WEEKS AGO IN OTTAWA, </p><p>HE HAD DISCUSSED BIOTECHNOLOGY WITH CANADA\'S DEPUTY MINISTER </p><p>OF FOREIGN TRADE.  URSO HAD SUGGESTED A TRADE OFF BETWEEN A </p><p>MORE HELPFUL ATTITUDE TOWARD ITALY\'S GEOGRAPHIC INDICATORS </p><p>PROPOSAL IN RETURN FOR A MORE HELPFUL ITALIAN ATTITUDE ON </p><p>BIOTECHNOLOGY.  OF COURSE, THIS WAS ONLY AN IDEA, NOT YET A </p><p>PROPOSAL, AND NEEDED A GREAT DEAL OF WORK, BUT IT MIGHT </p><p>ADVANCE TWO ISSUES OF GREAT IMPORTANCE TO OUR TWO RESPECTIVE </p><p>COUNTRIES. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) IN REPLY, ECMIN SAID THAT WASHINGTON WAS HIGHLY </p><p>UNLIKELY EVEN TO CONSIDER SUCH AN IDEA SO LONG AS THE </p><p>AGRICULTURE MINISTER CONTINUED TO CAMPAIGN FIERCELY AND </p><p>PUBLICLY AGAINST BIOTECHNOLOGY. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  04989  01 OF 02  111704Z </p><p>7. (C) NOTE:  URSO IS A LONG-TIME CLOSE ASSOCIATE OF DEPUTY </p><p>PRIME MINISTER FINI.  FINI, URSO AND MATTEOLI REPRESENT THE </p><p>LEADING FACTION OF THE ALLIANZA NAZIONALE (AN) COALITION </p><p>PARTNERS.  AGRICULTURE MINISTER ALEMANNO IS A MEMBER OF A </p><p>SMALLER FACTION WITHIN AN.  MFA EU AFFAIRS OFFICIAL MASSIMO </p><p>GAIANI TOLD US OCTOBER 9 THAT URSO\'S STAFF HAD BRIEFED HIM </p><p>ALREADY ON ECMIN\'S MEETING WITH URSO. END NOTE. </p><p> </p><p>AGRICULTURE U/S SCARPA </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.(C) AGMINCOUNSELOR MET WITH MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE UNDER </p><p>SECRETARY SCARPA TO DISCUSS REF A DEMARCHE.  SCARPA, WHO </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>STRONGLY DIFFERS FROM AGRICULTURE MINISTER ALEMANNO ON THE </p><p>SUBJECT OF BIOTECHNOLOGY, HAS CLOSE TIES TO BERLUSCONI. </p><p>SCARPA WELCOMED U.S. EFFORTS TO CONSTRUCTIVELY ENGAGE THE EU </p><p>ON WHERE AND HOW THE T/L AND F/F PROPOSALS COULD BE MADE MORE </p><p>PALATABLE FOR THE U.S.  HE WAS, HOWEVER, PESSIMISTIC THAT </p><p>ALEMANNO COULD BE PERSUADED TO TAKE A MORE FLEXIBLE LINE ON </p><p>THE F/F PROPOSAL.  SCARPA PROMISED TO SHARE THE U.S. MESSAGE </p><p>WITH THE AGRICULTURE MINISTER, BUT INDICATED THAT </p><p>BIOTECHNOLOGY WAS BECOMING AN IMPORTANT POLITICAL PLANK FOR </p><p>ALEMANNO, LEAVING HIM WITH LESS AND LESS ROOM FOR MANEUVER. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ8055 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  04989  02 OF 02  111704Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00  COME-00 </p><p>      CTME-00  DODE-00  SRPP-00  EB-00    EXIM-01  E-00     VC-00 </p><p>      FRB-00   HHS-01   H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   ITC-01   L-00 </p><p>      VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OES-01   OMB-01   OPIC-01 </p><p>      ACE-00   SP-00    SSO-00   SS-00    STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00 </p><p>      EPAE-00  DRL-02   G-00     SAS-00     /011W </p><p>                  ------------------F5F73E  111704Z /38 </p><p>P 111626Z OCT 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 6299 </p><p>INFO EU MEMBER STATES COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p>AMCONSUL MILAN </p><p>AMCONSUL FLORENCE </p><p>AMCONSUL NAPLES </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 ROME 004989 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>USDA/FAS/MACKE/JONES/SLUTSKY; </p><p>USDA FOR DAVID HEGWOOD; </p><p>STATE PASS USTR FOR SLOAN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/10/2007 </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, EUN, EAGR, TBIO, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: PRESSING ITALIAN POLICYMAKERS ON EU BIOTECH ISSUES </p><p> </p><p>9.

HENCE, SCARPA\'S EFFORTS TO KEEP </p><p>LETTA INFORMED OF DEVELOPMENTS.  WE HAVE HEARD SUBSEQUENTLY </p><p>FROM SCARPA\'S STAFF THAT LETTA HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE </p><p>LATEST DEVELOPMENTS IN THE U.S. POSITION. </p><p> </p><p>ENVIRONMENT MINISTRY DG CLINI </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) SCIENCE COUNSELOR MET WITH ENVIRONMENT MINISTER </p><p>MATTEOLI\'S DIRECTOR GENERAL FOR INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS, </p><p>CORRADO CLINI, ON OCTOBER 9 TO DISCUSS REFTEL POINTS, AS WELL </p><p>AS THE MINISTER\'S TRIP TO THE U.S.  MATTEOLI WILL SIGN AN </p><p>AGREEMENT WITH EPA ADMINISTRATOR WHITMAN, PART OF WHICH WILL </p><p>INVOLVE SCIENTIFIC COOPERATION ON BIOTECHNOLOGY. </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) CLINI NOTED THAT ENVIRONMENT MINISTRY MATTEOLI WILL </p><p>REPRESENT HIS MINISTRY\'S VIEWS AT THE OCTOBER 17 COUNCIL OF </p><p>ENVIRONMENT MINISTERS, AS THERE WAS NO COORDINATED GOI </p><p>POSITION. </p><p> </p><p>PRIME MINISTER\'S DIPLOMATIC ADVISOR CASTELLANETA </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>12.(C)  THE DCM MET OCTOBER 10 WITH DIPLOMATIC ADVISOR </p><p>CASTELLANETA IN THE PRIME MINISTER\'S OFFICE.

(C) WE HAVE, WITHOUT QUESTION, GOTTEN THE GOI\'S ATTENTION </p><p>ON THE UPCOMING BRUSSELS MEETINGS.  DESPITE THE EXPRESSIONS </p><p>OF UNDERSTANDING FROM OUR SEVERAL GOI INTERLOCUTORS, IT </p><p>REMAINS TO BE SEEN WHETHER ALEMANNO AND MATTEOLI WILL SOFTEN </p><p>THEIR STANCES WHILE IN THE ITALIAN CHAIR DURING THEIR </p><p>RESPECTIVE COUNCIL MEETINGS.  IN THE LONGER RUN, ALL SIGNS </p><p>CONTINUE TO POINT TO THE REALITY THAT A SIGNIFICANT SHIFT IN </p><p>ITALY\'S BIOTECH POLICY WILL REQUIRE THE DIRECT, PERSONAL </p><p>ENGAGEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME04989 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
