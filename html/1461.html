(SBU) SUMMARY: THE LATEST MAIZE SEED SALES DATA </p><p> </p><p>INDICATE THAT NATIONAL MAIZE PLANTING IS DOWN 25 PERCENT </p><p>FROM NORMAL LEVELS.  THE ZIMBABWE GRAIN PRODUCERS </p><p>ASSOCIATION (ZPGA), REPRESENTING LARGE SCALE COMMERCIAL </p><p>MAIZE PRODUCERS, PUBLISHED A STATEMENT ON DECEMBER 20 </p><p>APPEALING FOR ITS MEMBERS TO PLANT MORE MAIZE BEFORE THE </p><p>END OF THE MONTH.  SMALL-SCALE MAIZE PRODUCERS AND </p><p>COMMUNAL FARMERS MAY PLANT MORE MAIZE BEFORE THE END OF </p><p>DECEMBER, BUT THEY ARE HAVING DIFFICULTY AFFORDING THE </p><p>INPUTS NEEDED BECAUSE OF THE SHARP RISE IN THE PRICES OF </p><p>SEED, FERTILIZER, OTHER CHEMICALS, AND DIESEL, COMBINED </p><p>WITH THE FAILURE OF THE PARASTATAL GRAIN MARKETING BOARD </p><p>(GMB) TO PAY THESE FARMERS FOR THE 2000 HARVEST. </p><p>FORECASTS FOR NORMAL TO ABOVE-NORMAL RAINFALL IN THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  07271  01 OF 03  281349Z </p><p>PRINCIPAL MAIZE GROWING REGIONS IN ZIMBABWE MAY HELP TO </p><p>OFFSET THE PLANTING SHORTFALL BY INCREASING YIELDS.  THE </p><p>GMB CLAIMS TO HAVE 600,000 METRIC TONS OF MAIZE IN ITS </p><p>STRATEGIC GRAIN RESERVE, WHICH, IF ACCURATE, SHOULD </p><p>COVER THE PREDICTED SHORTFALL OF MAIZE IN THE 2001 </p><p>HARVEST.  ZIMBABWE ALSO FACES A LARGER THAN NORMAL </p><p>SHORTFALL IN WHEAT, NECESSITATING INCREASED WHEAT </p><p>IMPORTS AT A TIME WHEN THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE (GOZ) </p><p>HAS NO FOREIGN CURRENCY TO PURCHASE SUCH IMPORTS.  THE </p><p>REAL CRUNCH IN THE MAIZE SUPPLY MAY COME IN THE 2001/02 </p><p>SEASON.  PLANTING OF MAIZE FOR SEED IS ONLY 38 PERCENT </p><p>OF LAST YEAR\'S TOTAL.  IF THE GOZ FOLLOWS THROUGH ON ITS </p><p>"FAST-TRACK" RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM, REPLACING THE 2673 </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARMS THAT HAVE BEEN GAZETTED FOR COMPULSORY </p><p>ACQUISITION WITH THOUSANDS OF ILL-EQUIPPED SMALL-SCALE </p><p>FARMERS, ZIMBABWE\'S FOOD SECURITY IS LIKELY TO SUFFER. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>THE ZPGA MAKES A PLEA TO FARMERS TO PLANT MAIZE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>2.

THE </p><p>CHAIRMAN STATED THAT HE WAS TAKING THE ACTION FOR TWO </p><p>REASONS: FIRST, BECAUSE THE CURRENT CROP WILL NOT MEET </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S MAIZE NEEDS AND WILL LEAD TO A HIGHER PRICE </p><p>FOR MAIZE, AND SECOND, TO COUNTER A ZIMBABWE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  07271  01 OF 03  281349Z </p><p>BROADCASTING CORPORATION (ZBC) TELEVISION STORY THAT </p><p>STATED THAT COMMERCIAL FARMERS WERE SWITCHING FROM MAIZE </p><p>TO OTHER CROPS AS A PLOT (NOT STATED, BUT IMPLIED, TO </p><p>CAUSE A SHORTFALL IN THE NEXT MAIZE HARVEST THAT WOULD </p><p>BE BLAMED ON THE GOZ\'S LAND REFORM PROGRAM.)  THE </p><p>CHAIRMAN WENT ON TO STATE THAT THE LARGE SCALE </p><p>COMMERCIAL MAIZE PRODUCER HAS ALWAYS FELT A MORAL </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY FOR FOOD SECURITY IN ZIMBABWE, AND THE </p><p>REAL REASONS THAT MAIZE HECTARAGE WAS DOWN ON COMMERCIAL </p><p>FARMS WAS DUE TO THE ON-GOING LAND INVASIONS AND WORK </p><p>STOPPAGES, THE LACK OF PROFITABILITY OF MAIZE AS A CROP, </p><p>AND THE INABILITY OF MANY COMMERCIAL GROWERS TO OBTAIN </p><p>FINANCING FROM BANKS DUE TO THE GOZ "FAST-TRACK" LAND </p><p>REFORM PROGRAM AND COMPULSORY ACQUISITION. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>STRATEGIC GRAIN RESERVE SHOULD COVER MAIZE SHORTFALL </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>3.

EFFORTS TO SPEAK WITH </p><p>OFFICIALS AT THE PARASTATAL GRAIN MARKETING BOARD (GMB) </p><p>AND THE MINISTRY OF LANDS, AGRICULTURE AND RURAL </p><p>RESETTLEMENT WERE UNSUCCESSFUL.  ALL CONTACTS AGREED </p><p>THAT IF THE GMB REPORT OF 600,000 METRIC TONS OF MAIZE </p><p>IN THE STRATEGIC GRAIN RESERVE IS ACCURATE, ZIMBABWE </p><p>SHOULD HAVE SUFFICIENT MAIZE RESERVES TO GET IT THROUGH </p><p>TO THE APRIL HARVEST.  ZIMBABWE CONSUMES ABOUT 1,800,000 </p><p>METRIC TONS OF MAIZE PER YEAR, AND THIS YEAR\'S MAIZE </p><p>CROP ESTIMATE BASED ON SEED SALES IS FOR 1,200,000 </p><p>METRIC TONS, LEAVING THE GMB STRATEGIC GRAIN RESERVE TO </p><p>COVER THE SHORTFALL. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>THE REAL CRUNCH MAY COME IN 2002 </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  07271  02 OF 03  281350Z </p><p>4. (SBU) ALL THE CONTACTS AGREED THAT THE REAL SHORTFALL </p><p>IN MAIZE PRODUCTION, AND CONSEQUENT THREAT TO ZIMBABWE\'S </p><p>FOOD SECURITY, WILL OCCUR DURING THE 2001/2002 SEASON IF </p><p>THINGS STAY THE SAME IN ZIMBABWE.  THIS IS FOR VARIOUS </p><p>REASONS.  IF THE GOZ FOLLOWS THROUGH ON THE COMPULSORY </p><p>ACQUISITION OF THE COMMERCIAL FARMS THAT ARE LARGE-SCALE </p><p>MAIZE PRODUCERS, THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT THE COUNTRY\'S </p><p>MAIZE PRODUCTION WILL SEE A SHARP DECREASE.  IN THE </p><p>JUST-ENDED HARVEST SEASON, LARGE-SCALE MAIZE PRODUCERS </p><p>PRODUCED 850,000 METRIC TONS OF MAIZE ON JUST 162,000 </p><p>HECTARES, WHILE THE SMALL-SCALE AND COMMUNAL FARMERS </p><p>PRODUCED 1,100,000 METRIC TONS, BUT ON 1,100,000 </p><p>HECTARES.  EVEN IF THE GOZ INSTRUCTED ALL RESETTLED </p><p>PEOPLE TO GROW MAIZE AND PROVIDED THEM WITH NEEDED CROP </p><p>INPUTS, A VIRTUAL IMPOSSIBILITY GIVEN THE GOZ\'S </p><p>BUDGETARY CONSTRAINTS AND PAST TRACK RECORD, IT IS </p><p>EXTREMELY DOUBTFUL THAT THESE NEWLY RESETTLED FARMERS </p><p>WOULD BE ABLE TO REPLACE THE MAIZE PRODUCTION LOST FROM </p><p>THE LARGE-SCALE COMMERCIAL PRODUCERS. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) ANOTHER FACTOR IN THIS SCENARIO IS THE RISING </p><p>COST OF INPUTS NEEDED FOR MAIZE PRODUCTION.  IN </p><p>PARTICULAR, FERTILIZER AND DIESEL FUEL COSTS HAVE </p><p>INCREASED DRAMATICALLY THIS YEAR, AND WILL LIKELY </p><p>CONTINUE TO INCREASE SINCE BOTH PRODUCTS ARE IMPORTED. </p><p>THE SMALL-SCALE AND COMMUNAL FARMERS HAVE BEEN </p><p>STRUGGLING TO GET THE MONEY TO PLANT FOR THIS MAIZE </p><p>SEASON, AND THE SITUATION WILL LIKELY BE WORSE NEXT </p><p>YEAR.  THE GOZ HAS SET A PRELIMINARY MARKET PRICE OF </p><p>5,500 ZIMBABWE DOLLARS FOR A METRIC TON OF MAIZE, WHILE </p><p>THE ZPGA ESTIMATES THAT IT CURRENTLY COSTS ITS MEMBERS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  07271  02 OF 03  281350Z </p><p>7,000 ZIMBABWE DOLLARS TO PRODUCE A METRIC TON.  WHILE </p><p>SMALL-SCALE AND COMMUNAL FARMERS\' COSTS ARE LOWER THAN </p><p>THAT OF LARGE-SCALE PRODUCERS; THEIR FINANCIAL VIABILITY </p><p>REMAINS QUESTIONABLE AT CURRENT GOZ DETERMINED MAIZE </p><p>PRICES. </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) LASTLY, SEED MAIZE PLANTINGS ARE REPORTED BY THE </p><p>ZPGA TO BE ONLY 38 PERCENT OF THE HECTARAGE PLANTED LAST </p><p>YEAR.  THIS IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO BOTH THE FARM </p><p>INVASIONS, BECAUSE SEED MAIZE CROPS ARE HIGHLY </p><p>SUSCEPTIBLE TO DAMAGE DUE TO CROSS-FERTILIZATION WITH </p><p>REGULAR MAIZE PLANTED BY FARM OCCUPIERS, AS WELL AS THE </p><p>CURRENTLY POOR FINANCIAL VIABILITY IN ZIMBABWE OF MAIZE </p><p>AS A CROP.  BECAUSE THIS SEED MAIZE HAS BEEN SPECIALLY </p><p>ADAPTED TO THE GROWING CONDITIONS IN ZIMBABWE, IT CANNOT </p><p>BE IMPORTED FROM MANY PLACES OTHER THAN SOUTH AFRICA AND </p><p>MALAWI, COUNTRIES TO WHICH ZIMBABWE HISTORICALLY HAS </p><p>EXPORTED SEED MAIZE. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) ALL OF THESE FACTORS LEAD THE EXPERTS TO CONCLUDE </p><p>THAT IF THE GOZ CONTINUES FULL-STEAM AHEAD WITH THE </p><p>"FAST-TRACK" COMPULSORY ACQUISITION OF LARGE-SCALE MAIZE </p><p>PRODUCING COMMERCIAL FARMS; AND RESETTLES THESE FARMS </p><p>WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR NEEDED CROP INPUTS, NOT TO MENTION </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ7693 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  07271  03 OF 03  281350Z </p><p>ACTION AID-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AF-00    AMAD-00  CIAE-00  CTME-00  DODE-00 </p><p>      SRPP-00  EB-00    EXIM-01  E-00     VC-00    FRB-00   H-01 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   ITC-01   AC-01    NSAE-00  OMB-01   OPIC-01 </p><p>      ACE-00   SP-00    SSO-00   STR-00   USIE-00  DRL-02   G-00 </p><p>      SAS-00     /008W </p><p>                  ------------------B06C09  281351Z /38 </p><p>R 281349Z DEC 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 7903 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC </p><p>USDOC WASHDC </p><p>DEPT OF TREASURY WASHDC </p><p>USDA FAS WASHDC </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 HARARE 007271 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GSMITH </p><p>USDOC FOR 4510/EHENDERSON </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA/EBARBER, BHOFFMAN </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR BWILLIAMS </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p>PRETORIA FOR RHELM </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  07271  03 OF 03  281350Z </p><p>PASS USAID FOR AFR/SD - DWELLER, AFR/SA - CPALMA, </p><p>NNEWMAN, AA/AFR </p><p> </p><p>USTR FOR ROSA WHITAKER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL 12/28/10 </p><p>TAGS: EAGR, EAID, ZI </p><p> </p><p>SUBJECT: SIZEABLE SHORTFALL IN MAIZE PRODUCTION IN 2001 </p><p>LOOMS AS A REAL POSSIBILITY FOR ZIMBABWE </p><p> </p><p>THE MINIMAL INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDED FOR SUCCESSFUL </p><p>FARMING, THERE WILL BE A DRAMATIC REDUCTION IN THE SIZE </p><p>OF THE 2001/2002 MAIZE HARVEST.

THESE FACTORS ALL COMBINE TO RAISE THE CONCERN </p><p>OF THE EXPERTS THAT WHILE ZIMBABWE\'S FOOD SECURITY </p><p>SITUATION IS SATISFACTORY RIGHT NOW, A YEAR FROM NOW THE </p><p>COUNTRY COULD BE FACING A SITUATION OF FOOD INSECURITY. </p><p>OUR SOURCES ALL CLAIM THAT IF THE PREDICTED RAINFALL FOR </p><p>ZIMBABWE THIS SEASON DOES NOT MATERIALIZE, OR THE </p><p>COUNTRY DOES NOT RECEIVE GOOD RAINFALL DURING THE </p><p>2001/2002 SEASON, FOOD SECURITY COULD BECOME A SERIOUS </p><p>CRISIS SITUATION OF SIGNIFICANT PROPORTIONS. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  07271  03 OF 03  281350Z </p><p> </p><p>8.
