<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 PRETORIA 04652 </p><p> </p><p>CAPE TOWN FOR ALSO EMBASSY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS: PINR, SF, ZA </p><p>SUBJECT: THE ANC\'S THABO MBEKI AND CHRIS HANI </p><p> </p><p>REF:  STATE 67418 </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  WE APPRECIATE OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND TO QUESTIONS IN </p><p>REFTEL.  WE SHOULD SAY UP FRONT THAT WE DO NOT INTERACT </p><p>MUCH WITH CHRIS HANI, WHO PREFERS TO LEAVE DIPLOMATIC </p><p>CONTACTS TO OTHERS.  NOR DO WE OFTEN SEE MBEKI AND HANI </p><p>TOGETHER, EXCEPT FOR THE OCCASIONAL ASSEMBLAGE OF NEC </p><p>MEMBERS ON SOME PUBLIC PLATFORM.  WE HAVE NOT HEARD EITHER </p><p>MAN REFER IN ANY WAY TO THE OTHER, NOR HAVE WE SEEN THE </p><p>TWO FRATERNIZING AT THE HECTIC ANC HEADQUARTERS OR </p><p>ELSEWHERE.  WE BELIEVE, HOWEVER, THAT BOTH MEN ARE </p><p>EXCEPTIONALLY STRONG PERSONALITIES WITHIN THE ORGANIZATION </p><p>AND AMONG THE TOP FEW "MOVERS AND SHAKERS" IN THE </p><p>LEADERSHIP. </p><p> </p><p>3.  IF MBEKI AND HANI (BOTH 48) STILL HAVE A CLOSE </p><p>FRIENDSHIP, WE WOULD BE SURPRISED.  THOUGH CONTEMPORARIES </p><p>FROM TRANSKEI, MANY OTHER FACTORS MILITATE AGAINST A </p><p>SMOOTH RELATIONSHIP, NOT LEAST THEIR DIVERGENT FUNCTIONS </p><p>WITHIN THE ANC.  NOR COULD EITHER OF THEM BE OBLIVIOUS TO </p><p>THE INTENSE PUBLIC SPECULATION -- WHICH IS ALREADY GEARING </p><p>UP AGAIN IN ANTICIPATION OF THE JUNE ANC ELECTIONS -- OVER </p><p>WHICH OF THE TWO WILL ONE DAY MOVE INTO THE PREMIER </p><p>POSITION.  WHILE THE HANI-MBEKI LINK MAY NOT BE WARM, WE </p><p>SUSPECT BOTH MEN REALIZE THE OVERRIDING NEED TO MANAGE THE </p><p>RELATIONSHIP, FOR NOW AT LEAST, FOR THE SAKE OF THE </p><p>ORGANIZATION. </p><p> </p><p>4.  MBEKI IS THE CONSUMMATE DIPLOMAT WHO IS BELIEVED TO BE </p><p>LARGELY RESPONSIBLE FOR CHOREOGRAPHING THE OVERALL POLICY </p><p>SHIFT AWAY FROM THE ARMED STRUGGLE TO NEGOTIATIONS IN </p><p>RECENT YEARS.  HE IS RUMORED TO BE AMONG THE FIRST AND </p><p>MOST PERSUASIVE NEC MEMBERS TO ARGUE IN FAVOR OF </p><p>SUSPENDING ARMED ACTIONS LAST AUGUST.  IN MAKING HIS </p><p>ARGUMENTS, MBEKI NO DOUBT HAD TO MARSHAL CRITICAL </p><p>ASSESSMENTS OF THE EFFICACY OF THE ARMED STRUGGLE.  HANI </p><p>WOULD LIKELY HAVE VIEWED SUCH REMARKS AS BORDERING ON </p><p>CRITICISM OF HIS OWN EFFORTS AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  WHILE HANI NO DOUBT SUPPORTS OFFICIAL ANC POLICY, HE </p><p>SKIRTS VERY CLOSE TO THE EDGES WHEN IT COMES TO THE ROLE </p><p>OF UMKHONTO WE SIZWE (MK).  MANY OF HIS PUBLIC REMARKS, </p><p>WHICH THE SAG CONSIDERS INFLAMMATORY AND CONTRARY TO THE </p><p>SPIRIT OF ANC-SAG AGREEMENTS, COULD ONLY COMPLICATE </p><p>THABO\'S JOB OF MOVING TALKS FORWARD EXPEDITIOUSLY.  HANI\'S </p><p>HANDLING OF THE ARMED ACTIONS WORKING GROUP, WHICH HE </p><p>CHAIRED, LEFT MUCH TO BE DESIRED -- THOUGH, GRANTED, HE </p><p>HAD A VERY DIFFICULT TASK.  HANI FAILED TO SHOW UP FOR </p><p>SOME JOINT WORKING GROUP MEETINGS, EVEN AFTER HIS DISPUTED </p><p>INDEMNITY STATUS WAS RESOLVED.  HIS ANC COLLEAGUES WERE </p><p>SOMETIMES AT A LOSS TO EXPLAIN HIS ABSENCE TO US.  MBEKI </p><p>WOULD REGARD SUCH BEHAVIOR AS IRRESPONSIBLE AND DAMAGING </p><p>TO THE OVERALL NEGOTIATIONS STRATEGY. </p><p> </p><p>6.  TWO POLITICAL STYLES COULD HARDLY DIFFER MORE THAN </p><p>MBEKI\'S AND HANI\'S.  MBEKI TAKES A DISPASSIONATE, REASONED </p><p>APPROACH TO ISSUES WHICH HE PRESENTS IN UNDERSTATED </p><p>TERMS.  HIS AUTHORITY TO DEAL WITH SAG OFFICIALS, CAPTAINS </p><p>OF INDUSTRY, WHITE SOUTH AFRICAN OPINION LEADERS, FOREIGN </p><p>ENVOYS, ETC. IS SECOND ONLY TO MANDELA\'S.  WHEN THE DEPUTY </p><p>PRESIDENT TRAVELS ABROAD WITHOUT MBEKI, THE LATTER APPEARS </p><p>TO BE IN CHARGE OF ISSUES RELATING TO THE NEGOTIATIONS. </p><p>MANDELA WILL OFTEN PHONE MBEKI FROM OVERSEAS TO CHECK ON </p><p>DEVELOPMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>7.  MBEKI DOES NOT DEVOTE MUCH OF HIS TIME TO STUMPING </p><p>AMONG THE BLACK POPULATION.  HE RARELY FEATURES AT MASS </p><p>RALLIES AND DOES NOT, INSOFAR AS WE CAN TELL, ATTEMPT TO </p><p>CULTIVATE A CONSTITUENCY IN HIS HOME AREA (TRANSKEI) OR </p><p>ANYWHERE ELSE.  SOME OBSERVERS BELIEVE MBEKI\'S FAILURE TO </p><p>BUILD GRASSROOTS POLITICAL SUPPORT DAMAGES HIS APPEAL WITH </p><p>THE MASSES AND COULD HURT HIM IN HIS EVENTUAL BID FOR THE </p><p>TOP JOB (BUT WE ARE NOT CONVINCED).  WE HAVE HEARD LOWER </p><p>LEVEL ANC OFFICIALS REMARK THAT MBEKI\'S ASSOCIATION WITH </p><p>EFFORTS TO SOFTEN THE ANC SANCTIONS POSITION AT THE </p><p>DECEMBER CONSULTATIVE CONFERENCE HAS HURT HIM WITH THE </p><p>PARTY RANK AND FILE. </p><p> </p><p>8.  HANI IS MORE A MAN OF THE PEOPLE.  HE GENERALLY STAYS </p><p>OUT OF THE NEGOTIATING PROCESS (EXCEPT AS CHAIR OF THE </p><p>ARMED ACTIONS WORKING GROUP WHERE HE REPORTEDLY DOES A </p><p>GOOD JOB WHEN HE PARTICIPATES).  HE ESCHEWS CONTACTS WITH </p><p>DIPLOMATS, JOURNALISTS, BUSINESSMEN ETC., YET APPEARS </p><p>OFTEN ON PUBLIC PLATFORMS IN THE TOWNSHIPS WEARING </p><p>QUASI-COMBAT FATIGUES AND DELIVERING FIERY SPEECHES THAT </p><p>AROUSE AND DELIGHT THE AUDIENCE.  HANI MAY WELL CULTIVATE </p><p>THIS RADICAL IMAGE TO SOME EXTENT, AND WITTINGLY ALLOW </p><p>HIMSELF TO BE USED BY THE ANC AS A FOIL AGAINST THE PAC\'S </p><p>EFFORT TO WIN THE SOUL OF THE TOWNSHIP YOUTH. </p><p> </p><p>9.  HANI SPENDS ALOT OF TIME IN TRANSKEI, HIS BIRTHPLACE, </p><p>WHERE WITH GENERAL HOLOMISA\'S PERMISSION HE RESIDES IN THE </p><p>NOW-VACATED PRIME MINISTER\'S RESIDENCE AND OFTEN ADDRESSES </p><p>CROWDS THERE.  HIS REPEATED REFERENCES TO MK AND ITS ROLE </p><p>IN KEEPING THE SAG HONEST ENDEAR HIM TO THE MORE RADICAL </p><p>ELEMENTS OF THE MOVEMENT.  HANI WAS SELECTED TO DELIVER </p><p>THE HARD-HITTING GENERAL RESOLUTION AT THE DECEMBER </p><p>CONSULTATIVE CONFERENCE, WHERE THE RANK AND FILE PRIVATELY </p><p>BLASTED THE LEADERSHIP FOR SUSPENDING THE ARMED STRUGGLE </p><p>WITHOUT GETTING MUCH IN RETURN FROM THE SAG. </p><p> </p><p>10.  HANI\'S UNDERGROUND WORK IN THE COUNTRY, HIS ALLEGED </p><p>PARTICIPATION IN COMBAT ALONGSIDE ZAPU AGAINST SMITH\'S </p><p>RHODESIAN ARMY, AND HIS NARROW ESCAPE FROM MORE THAN ONE </p><p>ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT HAVE TAKEN ON LEGENDARY PROPORTIONS </p><p>IN THE TOWNSHIPS.  AGAIN, MANY OBSERVERS BELIEVE THAT HANI </p><p>WOULD TROUNCE MBEKI IF THERE WERE A POPULAR VOTE AMONG ANC </p><p>SUPPORTERS.  THE MEDIA HERE SOMETIMES SUGGESTS HANI IS </p><p>UNABASHEDLY PROMOTING HIS OWN ASCENT TO ANC LEADERSHIP, </p><p>BUT HOLOMISA -- WHO KNOWS HANI WELL -- SCOFFS AT </p><p>ALLEGATIONS THAT HANI IS POWER-HUNGRY.  HOLOMISA BELIEVES </p><p>HANI\'S APPOINTMENT TO THE SACP\'S INTERNAL LEADERSHIP GROUP </p><p>VIRTUALLY RULES HIM OUT OF CONTENTION FOR THE TOP ANC </p><p>POSITION.  THE LEADERSHIP OF THE ANC-SACP ALLIANCE, </p><p>HOLOMISA REASONS, WILL NEVER GO TO AN OFFICIAL FROM THE </p><p>SMALLER PARTY (I.E., THE SACP), AND HANI MUST HAVE </p><p>REALIZED THIS FACT WHEN HE ACCEPTED HIS SACP POSITION LAST </p><p>YEAR. </p><p> </p><p>11.  MBEKI IS SAID TO HAVE A SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP WITH ANC </p><p>PRESIDENT OLIVER TAMBO, WHO MADE THABO HIS POLITICAL </p><p>SECRETARY IN 1978.  WE HAVE NOT, HOWEVER, OBSERVED ANY </p><p>PARTICULAR WARMTH IN THE MBEKI-MANDELA RELATIONSHIP, BUT </p><p>CLEARLY MANDELA HAS ENTRUSTED A GREAT DEAL TO THABO.  HANI </p><p>DOES STAY AT THE MANDELA RESIDENCE WHEN HE IS IN THIS </p><p>AREA, BUT WE BELIEVE THIS PRIMARILY REFLECTS THE FACT THAT </p><p>HE IS A FAVORITE OF WINNIE\'S.  HE FREQUENTLY JOINS HER ON </p><p>THE PLATFORM AT MASS RALLIES WHERE BOTH ARE ASKED TO </p><p>SPEAK, AND HE OFTEN ACCOMPANIES HER TO TRIAL IN </p><p>JOHANNESBURG. </p><p> </p><p>12.  BOTH HANI AND MBEKI ARE UNIVERSITY EDUCATED WITH AN </p><p>INTELLECTUAL BENT AND HAVE UNDERGONE MILITARY TRAINING. </p><p>SAG OFFICIALS HAVE REMARKED PARTICULARLY ON HANI\'S ABILITY </p><p>TO DEBATE THE FINE POINTS OF THE CLASSICS.  THE LATEST </p><p>"WHO\'S WHO" BY SHELAGH GASTROW NOTES THAT HANI ROSE TO THE </p><p>ANC\'S NATIONAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE IN 1974 (AT THE AGE OF </p><p>32), WHILE MBEKI WAS APPOINTED IN 1975. </p><p> </p><p>13.  IN MANY WAYS, HANI AND MBEKI PERSONIFY AND EPITOMIZE </p><p>THE TWO FACES OF THE ANC.  ALTHOUGH THERE IS WIDESPREAD </p><p>SPECULATION THAT THE TWO ARE AMBITIOUS RIVALS, WE HAVE NO </p><p>CONCLUSIVE PROOF THAT THIS IS THE CASE.  IF A RIVALRY </p><p>EXISTS, NEITHER MAN GAINS FROM PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE OF IT. </p><p>FOR NOW, WE WOULD EXPECT HANI AND MBEKI TO CONCENTRATE ON </p><p>THEIR RESPECTIVE PORTFOLIOS WHILE KEEPING ANY LEADERSHIP </p><p>ASPIRATIONS THEY MAY HAVE CAREFULLY UNDER WRAPS. </p><p> </p><p>SWING. </p><p></p></div>
