<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 TEGUCIGALPA 001686 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>PASS TO USITC FOR D.F. LEAHY </p><p>STATE PASS USTR FOR CENTAM/CARIB DIRECTOR </p><p>STATE FOR EB/TPP/MTA/IPC </p><p> </p><p>E.O.12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, EINV, EIND, KTEX, HO </p><p>SUBJECT: HONDURAN TEXTILE INDUSTRY DOWNTURN HIGHLIGHTS USITC </p><p>CARRIBEAN BASIN INVESTMENT SURVEY </p><p> </p><p>REF: SECSTATE 141419 </p><p> </p><p>1.  Post submits the following report in response to reftel </p><p>request for the biennial report of the U.S. International </p><p>Trade Commission (USITC) on the Caribbean Basin Economic </p><p>Recovery Act (CBERA), as required by section 215(a) of the </p><p>CBERA. </p><p> </p><p>2.  Summary: The slowdown and sluggish recovery of the U.S. </p><p>economy during 2001 and 2002 continue to have a depressing </p><p>effect on the Honduran maquila sector, and the future is </p><p>clouded by fears of being unable to compete with China and </p><p>other Asian producers after quotas are removed in 2005. </p><p>While CBTPA benefits have been crucial to the establishment </p><p>of the maquila industry in Honduras, the industry is now </p><p>hoping for improved market access and rules of origin under </p><p>CAFTA to provide opportunity for future growth.  During the </p><p>period covered by this survey, total investment in the </p><p>sector increased, passing 1.5 billion in 2002, but total </p><p>employment in the industry fell by 15 percent from 2000 to </p><p>2002.  In 2002, 13 maquilas closed in Honduras as a result </p><p>of the slowdown in the U.S. economy and management problems. </p><p>Of those 13 companies, eight were U.S. companies.  End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>Honduran Maquila Association Statistics </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  The Honduran Maquila Association (AHM) is an active </p><p>industry advocacy group based in the North Coast city of San </p><p>Pedro Sula.  It represents 217 (roughly 90 percent) of the </p><p>apparel assembly operations in Honduras, and is the primary </p><p>source of statistical information for this industry.  Rather </p><p>than attempting to collect data directly from individual </p><p>companies, as we did two years ago with very incomplete </p><p>results, we have this year relied on statistics from the </p><p>AHM.  Investment statistics for 2002 are still preliminary </p><p>and incomplete, but do provide a general picture. </p><p> </p><p>4.  Investment: According to AHM records, in 2002, the </p><p>maquila industry totaled just over USD 1.56 billion of </p><p>accumulated investment, up from 1.421 billion in 2001 and </p><p>1.237 billion in 2000.  A detailed breakdown of investment </p><p>by country of origin was not available; however, U.S. </p><p>companies own 40 percent of the maquilas in Honduras. </p><p>Honduran companies are the next largest owner with 31 </p><p>percent of all operations, followed by companies from Korea </p><p>with 15 percent, Hong Kong with 4 percent and Taiwan with 2 </p><p>percent.  Total accumulated foreign investment in the sector </p><p>was roughly USD 830 million in 2002, up from USD 750 million </p><p>in 2001 and USD 650 million in 2000.  The AHM predicts </p><p>investment growth of ten percent per year, which would bring </p><p>total accumulated investment in the industry to USD 2.08 </p><p>billion by 2005.  Note: Four knitting operations and several </p><p>investments in full package apparel operations were </p><p>initiated during this period in response to enhancements </p><p>included in the U.S. program.  End note. </p><p> </p><p>5.  The Central Bank reports that new FDI in Honduras in </p><p>2002 totaled USD 219 million, of which USD 76 million (35 </p><p>percent) was in the maquila industry.  This is down from USD </p><p>296 million of FDI in 2001, of 101 million (34 percent) was </p><p>in the maquila industry. </p><p> </p><p>6.  Employment: Employment in the industry has been in </p><p>decline, from 126,000 employees in 2000, to 110,083 in 2001, </p><p>to 107,398 in 2002, a 15 percent drop over two years.  This </p><p>decrease occurred despite the estimated creation of 10,000 </p><p>new jobs from 2001 to 2002.  AHM also estimates that the </p><p>industry supports 535,000 direct dependents (assuming a </p><p>ratio of five dependents to every one worker) and 1.07 </p><p>million supplier and service beneficiaries (based on a ten- </p><p>to-one ratio).  In 2002, women comprised 67 percent of the </p><p>maquila workforce, down slightly from 72 percent in 2000, as </p><p>the diminishing stigma of working in apparel assembly </p><p>factories leads to increasing male participation. </p><p> </p><p>7.  Thirteen maquilas closed in 2002, though 11 new maquilas </p><p>opened during the same period.  Of the 13 closings, eight </p><p>were U.S. companies, while only three of the new ventures </p><p>were U.S. originated.  These numbers represent a lower </p><p>turnover rate than in 2001, when 35 maquilas closed and 30 </p><p>maquilas opened in Honduras.  Since 1998 there have been no </p><p>geographical restrictions for the establishment of a Free </p><p>Trade Zone (FTZ) in Honduras.  Instead, any company may </p><p>apply for FTZ status so long as they are producing for </p><p>export.  The companies with FTZ status are still </p><p>overwhelmingly concentrated at the north coast and near San </p><p>Pedro Sula, with some operations in Tegucigalpa. </p><p> </p><p>8.  Exports: In 2002, Honduras ranked as the third-largest </p><p>supplier of textiles and apparel to the U.S. market. </p><p>Honduras ranks first among Central American and CBI </p><p>countries in textile exports to the U.S.  Total exports from </p><p>the Honduran maquila industry totaled USD 2.439 billion in </p><p>2002, a slight increase over previous figures of USD 2.344 </p><p>billion in 2001 and 2.362 billion in 2000. </p><p> </p><p>9.  Note: The decline in employment and stagnation in </p><p>exports are especially striking when viewed in historical </p><p>context.  From 1994-2000, the value of maquila sector </p><p>exports grew on average at a rate of 25 percent per year, </p><p>compared with just 2 percent per year from 2000 to 2002. </p><p>Likewise, during the 1990\'s employment in the Honduran </p><p>maquila sector enjoyed tremendous growth - from only 9,000 </p><p>workers in 1990, to 55,000 in 1995, and then to its peak of </p><p>126,000 in 2000.  At that time, industry officials predicted </p><p>that employment would reach 250,000 by 2005.  These figures </p><p>have since been adjusted to account for the U.S. economic </p><p>downturn, which has affected the receipt of production </p><p>contracts in the Honduran maquila sector.  Current estimates </p><p>place the predicted number of employees in the maquila </p><p>sector at 143,000 for the year 2005, though even this </p><p>estimate assumes (somewhat optimistically) a ten percent </p><p>annual rate of employment growth.  End note. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>Industry Concerns </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  According to AHM, CBERA makes the country more </p><p>attractive to drawback factory investment, construction and </p><p>expansion of industrial parks, and importation of tax free </p><p>textile machinery, equipment, and accessories.  However the </p><p>slowdown of the U.S. economy impacts significantly the </p><p>Honduran textile and apparel sector by reducing purchase </p><p>orders and lowering revenues. </p><p> </p><p>11.  The future effects of the CBERA program will </p><p>undoubtedly be influenced by the results of the ongoing </p><p>negotiations for a Central American Free Trade Agreement </p><p>(CAFTA).  The market access discussions represent a pivotal </p><p>topic of discussion for the Honduran economy.  A key point </p><p>in the CBERA program, rules of origin, is an essential </p><p>component of the CAFTA negotiations for the maquila </p><p>industry.  Under the current agreement, some maquilas cannot </p><p>obtain the U.S. components required to meet U.S. standard </p><p>requirements.  For example, manufacturers of brassieres </p><p>cannot access all of the required components from U.S. </p><p>suppliers.  Thus, the maquilas hope for a more flexible </p><p>rules of origin regime under CAFTA.  Another problem </p><p>regarding the CBERA program is certain exclusion provisions. </p><p>The provision excluding socks was mentioned by an industry </p><p>official as a limiting factor of the CBERA program\'s </p><p>potential benefits. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  The maquila sector\'s poor performance during the period </p><p>covered by this report (2001 and 2002) plainly demonstrates </p><p>the sector\'s dependence on the U.S. economy.  No matter how </p><p>beneficial the preferences under CBERA, the sector cannot </p><p>maintain 1990\'s-style growth when the U.S. economy is </p><p>stagnating.  Looking to the future, there are serious </p><p>industry concerns about competition with China once textile </p><p>quotas are removed in 2005.  Without immediate duty free </p><p>treatment, maquila owners are concerned about their </p><p>competitiveness in a non-quota driven market.  One industry </p><p>official noted the flight of factories will be a given.  He </p><p>noted a conversation with a prominent client who commented </p><p>that the company would transfer at least 30 percent of its </p><p>business to Asia if the CAFTA agreement does not provide a </p><p>sufficiently attractive incremental market access, to allow </p><p>the industry in Honduras to compete with Asia.  Proximity to </p><p>the U.S. is important, but it is not enough.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p>PALMER </p><p></p></div>
