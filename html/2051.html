KUWAIT\'S DE FACTO PRIME MINISTER AND FOREIGN MINISTER, </p><p>SHAYKH SABAH AL-AHMAD, CONVOKED THE EDITORS-IN-CHIEF OF THE </p><p>KUWAITI NEWSPAPERS AND MAGAZINES OCTOBER 10 TO DISCUSS THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S VIEW OF THE CURRENT SITUATION.  SHAYKH SABAH\'S </p><p>STATEMENTS WERE CARRIED OCTOBER 11 BY ALL PAPERS ON THE </p><p>FRONT PAGE.  BELOW ARE KEY EXCERPTS, INCLUDING HIS </p><p>REAFFIRMATION OF KUWAIT\'S STRONG SUPPORT FOR THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COALITION AGAINST TERRORISM AND PRAISE FOR </p><p>PRESIDENT BUSH\'S STATEMENT RECOGNIZING "THE PALESTINIAN </p><p>STATE."  THE FOREIGN MINISTER STATED THAT BIN LADEN DOES NOT </p><p>KNOW PALESTINE AND DOES NOT CARE FOR THE PALESTINIANS, </p><p>OBSERVING, "HE KNOWS NOTHING BUT TERRORISM." </p><p> </p><p>2.  PARA 8 REPORTS THE STATEMENTS OF DR. MOHAMMED AL-SABAH, </p><p>KUWAIT\'S MINISTER OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS, UPON HIS </p><p>RETURN OCTOBER 10 FROM THE OIC CONFERENCE IN DOHA.  DR. </p><p>MOHAMMED AL-SABAH STRESSED THAT THE OIC FOREIGN MINISTERS </p><p>HAD REFUSED TO MIX THE CONCEPT OF TERRORISM -- TARGETING </p><p>UNARMED INNOCENT CIVILIANS TO ACHIEVE POLITICAL GOALS -- </p><p>WITH THE LEGITIMACY OF NATIONAL EFFORTS TO COMBAT FOREIGN </p><p>OCCUPATION AND IMPERIALISM. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER TO EDITORS </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  AL-QAEDA SPOKESMAN TO BE STRIPPED OF CITIZENSHIP:  THE </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER ANNOUNCED THAT KUWAIT WILL STRIP SULEIMAN </p><p>BU GHEITH, THE KUWAITI IMAM WHO IS THE SPOKESMAN OF AL- </p><p>QAEDA, OF HIS CITIZENSHIP. (SEE REFTEL.)  "THIS IS THE LEAST </p><p>WE CAN DO TO MAINTAIN KUWAIT\'S SECURITY FOR THIS PERSON IS </p><p>MORE AFGHAN THAN KUWAITI AND HE DOES NOT REPRESENT THE </p><p>PEOPLE OF KUWAIT."  THE FOREIGN MINISTER DESCRIBED BU GHAITH </p><p>AS COMMITTING "TREASON AND CRIMINAL ACTS." </p><p> </p><p>4.  KUWAIT\'S STAND ON TERRORISM:  THE FOREIGN MINISTER SAID </p><p>THAT KUWAIT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST COUNTRIES TO REJECT ALL </p><p>FORMS OF TERRORISM, RECALLING KUWAIT\'S OWN EXPERIENCE WITH </p><p>TERRORISM IN THE 1980S.  "KUWAIT SUPPORTS THE WAR AGAINST </p><p>TERRORISM AND TERRORISTS WHEREVER THEY MAY BE AND WE </p><p>ENCOURAGE ALL TO ERADICATE THIS PHENOMENON.  ULTIMATELY, WE </p><p>ARE MUSLIMS AND ISLAM IS A RELIGION OF PEACE.  A TRUE MUSLIM </p><p>IS PEACEFUL IN WORDS AND DEEDS."  HE STRESSED THAT TERRORISM </p><p>IS UNISLAMIC.  "WE SUPPORT COMBATING THOSE WHO SUPPORT </p><p>TERRORISM OR HARBOR TERRORISTS OR OFFER ANY SUPPORT FOR </p><p>TERRORISM."  HE ALSO STRESSED THAT KUWAIT IS AGAINST </p><p>TERRORISM, NOT PEOPLE, OR COMMUNITIES, OR RELIGIONS.  "WE </p><p>SUPPORT THE INTERNATIONAL COALITION WHOSE AIM IS TO </p><p>ERADICATE TERRORISM."  HE SAID THE CAMPAIGN AGAINST </p><p>TERRORISM IS BASED ON UN RESOLUTIONS AND OTHER INTERNATIONAL </p><p>AGREEMENTS, ADDING "KUWAIT IS BOUND" TO ABIDE BY THESE </p><p>INSTRUMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  KUWAIT\'S RELATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES:  DURING THE </p><p>OCTOBER 13 VISIT OF DEFENSE UNDER SECRETARY DONALD FEITH, </p><p>SHAYKH SABAH RECOUNTED, "THE UNITED STATES DID NOT ASK FOR </p><p>ANYTHING EXCEPT THE EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITHIN THE </p><p>FRAMEWORK OF COMBATING TERRORISM.  WE HAVE ASSURED ALL </p><p>AMERICAN OFFICIALS WHOM WE HAVE MET THAT WE ARE AGAINST </p><p>TERRORISM AND THAT WE HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN AMERICA\'S POSITION </p><p>IN SUPPORT OF US IN 1990 WHEN KUWAIT WAS INVADED.  WE HAVE </p><p>NOT FORGOTTEN THAT WE HAVE AN AGREEMENT WITH THEM." </p><p> </p><p>6.  KUWAIT\'S VIEW OF U.S. ROLE IN PEACE PROCESS:  SHAYKH </p><p>SABAH CITED AN ARABIC PROVERB WHICH MEANS \'THERE IS A SILVER </p><p>LINING IN EVERY CLOUD.\'  "AMERICA HAS NOW BEGUN TO LOOK WITH </p><p>INTEREST AT THE PALESTINIAN ISSUE.  WE EXPRESSED OUR HOPES </p><p>DURING FEITH\'S VISIT THAT AMERICAN OFFICIALS WOULD KEEP IN </p><p>MIND THAT THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE BEFORE THE WORLD FOR THE </p><p>PALESTINIAN CAUSE AND THAT THE PALESTINIANS HAVE SUFFERED A </p><p>GREAT INJUSTICE."  SHAYKH SABAH ALSO CALLED ON THE AMERICAN </p><p>ADMINISTRATION TO UNDERTAKE POSITIVE AND PRACTICAL MEASURES </p><p>TO SOLVE THE PALESTINIAN ISSUE AND TO ESTABLISH A </p><p>PALESTINIAN STATE.  HE TOLD FEITH: "SOLVING THE PALESTINIAN </p><p>ISSUE IS ALSO PART OF COMBATING TERRORISM." </p><p> </p><p>7.  SHAYKH SABAH PRAISED PRESIDENT BUSH\'S STATEMENT </p><p>RECOGNIZING "THE PALESTINIAN STATE."  HE EXPLAINED THAT </p><p>THERE WAS AN AMERICAN INITIATIVE WITH REGARDS TO THE </p><p>PALESTINIAN STATE THAT WAS UNDERWAY IN COOPERATION WITH </p><p>SAUDI ARABIA BUT THE SEPTEMBER 11 TERRORIST ATTACKS </p><p>POSTPONED THIS INITIATIVE.  HE SAID, "I DON\'T KNOW THE </p><p>DETAILS OF THIS INITIATIVE."  HE ALSO SAID THAT SAUDI ARABIA </p><p>HAD PRESSURED THE ADMINISTRATION TO FIND AN AMERICAN </p><p>SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM.  HE ADDED THAT BIN LADEN DOES NOT </p><p>KNOW PALESTINE AND DOES NOT CARE FOR THE PALESTINIANS, </p><p>OBSERVING, "HE KNOWS NOTHING BUT TERRORISM." </p><p> </p><p>8.  KUWAIT\'S REGULATION OF ISLAMIC CHARITIES:  THE FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER ALSO TALKED IN DETAIL ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>CONSULTATIONS WITH ISLAMIC CHARITIES AND PLANS TO REGULATE </p><p>THE COLLECTION AND DISTRIBUTION OF CHARITABLE ASSISTANCE. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>KUWAIT ON OIC STATEMENT </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  NO LINK BETWEEN TERRORISM AND LEGITIMATE RESISTANCE: </p><p>THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS, DR. MOHAMMED AL- </p><p>SABAH, SPOKE TO THE KUWAITI PRESS OCTOBER 10 UPON HIS RETURN </p><p>FROM THE OIC CONFERENCE IN DOHA.  HE STRESSED THAT THE OIC </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTERS HAD REFUSED TO CONFUSE THE CONCEPT OF </p><p>TERRORISM -- TARGETING UNARMED INNOCENT CIVILIANS TO ACHIEVE </p><p>POLITICAL GOALS -- WITH THE LEGITIMACY OF NATIONAL EFFORTS </p><p>TO COMBAT FOREIGN OCCUPATION AND IMPERIALISM.  WITH REGARD </p><p>TO ATTACKS AGAINST MUSLIM OR ARAB STATES, DR. MOHAMMED AL- </p><p>SABAH SAID:  "ANY SUCH ATTACK WOULD BE UNDER THE UMBRELLA OF </p><p>INTERNATIONAL LEGITIMACY, AND THERE IS AN IMPLICIT CONSENSUS </p><p>THAT IT IS THE RIGHT OF THE UNITED STATES AND BRITAIN TO </p><p>DEFEND THEMSELVES UNDER ARTICLE 51 OF THE UN CHARTER. </p><p>THEREFORE, THE MILITARY ACTS IN AFGHANISTAN WERE NOT </p><p>DENOUNCED." </p><p> </p><p>10.  DR. MOHAMED AL-SABAH ADDED:  "AT THE SAME TIME, </p><p>HOWEVER, WE HAVE DEMANDED THAT ISRAEL DOES NOT USE THE </p><p>EXCUSE OF COMBATING TERRORISM TO ATTACK ARAB </p><p>COUNTRIES...THERE WILL BE AN INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON </p><p>COMBATING TERRORISM WHICH WILL DESIGNATE SPECIFIC CONCEPTS </p><p>(OF TERRORISM)." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
