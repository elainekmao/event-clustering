<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 002626 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR NEA AND PRM; PLEASE PASS TO USAID </p><p>KUWAIT AND NICOSIA FOR DART </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/01/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREF, PREL, PHUM, KPAL, IZ, JO, UNSC </p><p>SUBJECT: PALESTINIANS IN POST-SADDAM IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>REF: CAMPBELL/PRM MAY 2 E-MAIL </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: A/DCM Doug Silliman per 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary and Comment:  The estimated 90,000 long-term </p><p>Palestinian residents of Iraq reportedly are losing the legal </p><p>protection, privileges and access to government services </p><p>extended by the Saddam government, resulting in a flow of </p><p>more than 800 Palestinians toward Jordan since the onset of </p><p>hostilities.  Palestinian refugees in Iraq are not covered by </p><p>UNRWA\'s mandate and therefore have no alternative to Iraqi </p><p>government services.  Absent coalition plans to ensure access </p><p>to basic social services for Palestinians in post-Saddam </p><p>Iraq, the PLO plans to seek a new UNGA resolution to expand </p><p>UNRWA\'s mandate to Iraq.  UNRWA is not interested in a new </p><p>mandate and doubts the PLO\'s efforts will be successful. </p><p>Although UNHCR is prepared to provide assistance to </p><p>Palestinians fleeing post-Saddam Iraq, a new Palestinian </p><p>refugee population queuing on international borders could </p><p>prove destabilizing throughout the region.  To prevent that </p><p>refugee flow, we believe the authorities in Iraq should </p><p>examine ways to ensure that protection and basic services are </p><p>extended to Palestinians resident in Iraq.  End summary and </p><p>comment. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p>Background -- Protection & Privileges Under Saddam </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) The 90,000 Palestinians resident in Iraq are believed </p><p>to be a mix of original 1948 refugees and their descendants </p><p>(roughly 30,000) as well as more recent arrivals who have </p><p>migrated to Iraq for economic and political reasons. </p><p>(Comment:  Because Palestinian refugees in Iraq are not </p><p>covered under UNRWA\'s mandate, there is no practical </p><p>difference between UNRWA refugees and ordinary Palestinians </p><p>resident in Iraq.  UNRWA status only gives Palestinian </p><p>refugees the right to access UNRWA services in areas under </p><p>UNRWA\'s mandate -- Gaza, West Bank, Jordan, Syria and </p><p>Lebanon.  It does not provide legal protection or in any way </p><p>influence a sovereign state\'s decision to admit or deny entry </p><p>to Palestinian refugees.)  Under the Saddam regime, </p><p>Palestinians resident in Iraq had rights to legal residency, </p><p>including travel documents, and access to free government </p><p>services such as health and education.  According to PLO </p><p>Refugee Affairs official Mohamed Abu Bakr, a significant </p><p>portion of the Palestinian population in Iraq also enjoyed </p><p>preferential housing arrangements, paying nominal rent or </p><p>sometimes even no rent at all.  Because very little </p><p>information is available about the Palestinian community in </p><p>Iraq, it is unclear what percentage of this population was </p><p>financially dependent on subsidized housing. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>Housing Evictions & Threats of Reprisals </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Palestinians in post-Saddam Iraq appear to be losing </p><p>at least some of these privileges.  On April 15, PLO Official </p><p>Abu Bakr reported to refcoord that 27 Palestinian families in </p><p>Baghdad\'s Baladiyat neighborhood had been evicted from their </p><p>homes because their landlords no longer agreed to the low </p><p>rents previously guaranteed by the Saddam government.  These </p><p>families sought shelter in a football stadium near the </p><p>Palestinian embassy and have been there ever since.  ICRC </p><p>officials subsequently confirmed to US Mission Geneva that a </p><p>total of 120 Palestinian families have been driven from their </p><p>homes in this neighborhood and are in need of both protection </p><p>and basic humanitarian assistance (ref).  According to an </p><p>April 27 report in the Arabic daily newspaper Al Sharq Al </p><p>Awsat, another 1500 Palestinian families are in danger of </p><p>being evicted from their homes.  PLO and UNHCR officials </p><p>worry that Palestinians may be subjected to politically based </p><p>evictions as well.  Nabil Musawi, an aide to INC leader Ahmed </p><p>Chalabi, was widely quoted in mid-April (including in the </p><p>Jerusalem Post) as having suggested that any Arabs expelled </p><p>from their homes in northern Iraq would be welcome to expel </p><p>Palestinians from their homes in Baghdad. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>Access to Government Services? </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) In addition to shelter needs, the PLO\'s Department of </p><p>Refugee Affairs fears that long-term Palestinian residents of </p><p>Iraq will lose access to free health and education services </p><p>formerly guaranteed by the Saddam regime.  Abu Bakr told </p><p>refcoord that because Iraq is not covered by UNRWA\'s mandate, </p><p>Palestinians in Iraq do not have any alternative to Iraqi </p><p>government facilities.  Abu Bakr asked whether the coalition </p><p>forces had long-term plans to ensure that Palestinians </p><p>retained access to Iraqi government services.  Absent such </p><p>plans, he continued, the Palestinians would seek to extend </p><p>UNRWA\'s mandate to Iraq.  Palestinian Observer to the UN </p><p>Naser Al Kidweh already has been instructed to seek UN </p><p>support for the General Assembly resolution required to </p><p>change UNRWA\'s mandate.  (UNRWA Deputy Commissioner General </p><p>Karen Abu Zayd later told refcoord UNRWA was not interested </p><p>in expanding its mandate and expressed doubts that the PLO\'s </p><p>planned approach to the General Assembly would be effective.) </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>Palestinians Already Fleeing Iraq </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) The changing status of Palestinians in post-Saddam </p><p>Iraq has already resulted in the movement of Palestinians </p><p>from Iraq to Jordan, with more than 800 having sought entry </p><p>since the onset of hostilities.  As of mid-day on May 4, 762 </p><p>Palestinians have been admitted to the UNHCR refugee camp at </p><p>Ruweished, while another 40 remain in the Jordan Red </p><p>Crescent\'s TCN transit camp.  (Approximately 100 Palestinians </p><p>in the UNHCR camp hold Jordanian citizenship but have elected </p><p>to stay in the camp with their family members who do not </p><p>possess Jordanian passports.)  UNHCR protection officials </p><p>report that the Palestinians have provided a range of reasons </p><p>for fleeing Iraq.  Some report that they have been physically </p><p>threatened and told that they no longer were welcome in </p><p>post-Saddam Iraq, while others report that they have been </p><p>evicted from their homes due to post-Saddam rent increases. </p><p>A large number of these Palestinians (163 today, May 4) are </p><p>unaccompanied young men, some of whom have told UNHCR they </p><p>would like to study in Jordan and may have lost access to </p><p>Saddam-guaranteed scholarships in Iraq.  Other young men </p><p>appear to be economic migrants, simply looking for better </p><p>opportunities in Jordan.  Although the GOJ in early April </p><p>allowed a group of 40 Palestinians to enter Amman on a </p><p>temporary basis (with guarantees from Jordanian family </p><p>members that their stay truly would be temporary), the GOJ is </p><p>unlikely to allow any Palestinians to enter Jordan from the </p><p>UNHCR refugee camp until the steady flow of new Palestinian </p><p>arrivals from Iraq (estimated at 30-50 per day) abates. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) The Palestinians, like other groups viewed as </p><p>supporters or guests of Saddam Hussein, are in danger of </p><p>losing their privileges and possibly suffering political </p><p>reprisals in post-Saddam Iraq.  If the post-Saddam government </p><p>does not extend legal protection and basic services to </p><p>Palestinians, they most likely would seek refuge in Jordan in </p><p>increasingly large numbers -- a political and economic burden </p><p>the GOJ has indicated it will not accept.  While UNHCR is </p><p>prepared to meet the needs of Palestinians fleeing </p><p>post-Saddam Iraq, creation of a new Palestinian refugee </p><p>population queuing on international borders could be a </p><p>destabilizing factor throughout the region.  To prevent that </p><p>refugee flow, we believe the authorities in Iraq should </p><p>examine ways to ensure that protection and basic services are </p><p>extended to the Palestinian population of Iraq. </p><p>BERRY </p><p></p></div>
