A. ANKARA 3693 </p><p>     B. B. ANKARA 3815 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but Unclassified.  Not for Internet distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary: IMF Resident Representative Odd Per Brekk </p><p>indicated to us today that, even with speedy conclusion of </p><p>the GOT\'s letter of intent, the IMF\'s fifth review "cannot" </p><p>be completed by the end of June, bringing into full play </p><p>tough end-of-June performance targets.   Benign markets </p><p>stemming largely from external factors, he suggested, have </p><p>made the government complacent.  For the fifth review, Breck </p><p>highlighted two key outstanding issues-- government agreement </p><p>to additional fiscal measures to close the one-half percent </p><p>of GNP shortfall the Fund sees in the primary surplus, and </p><p>agreement on technical measures to implement a compromise </p><p>"case-by-case" approach to the government\'s desired social </p><p>security amnesty.  State Minister Babacan will chair a </p><p>meeting at Treasury today to review the government\'s </p><p>commitments under the fifth review.  Brekk stressed that the </p><p>Fund has not discussed the idea of merging the fifth and </p><p>sixth reviews, and that he would argue strongly against such </p><p>a course, as it would essentially reward "bad" behavior. </p><p>While the Treasury\'s initial auctions this week have been </p><p>successful, Brekk characterized the Treasury\'s current cash </p><p>position as "not comfortable," and suggested it would only </p><p>"scrape by" in tomorrow\'s large bond redemption.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Oustanding Issues: Brekk noted that internal IMF </p><p>timelines virtually preclude completion of an IMF board </p><p>meeting on Turkey before the end of June, even if all </p><p>outstanding issues were resolved quickly.  Several key issues </p><p>remain outstanding, notably agreement on additional fiscal </p><p>measures to achieve the targeted 6.5 percent primary surplus, </p><p>and completion of "technical work" to implement agreement on </p><p>a "case-by-case" approach to a social security amnesty, in </p><p>place of the general amnesty that the government had earlier </p><p>proposed and at which the Fund had balked.  (Brekk noted that </p><p>he believes Erdogan, at heart, still wants the latter.) </p><p>Brekk noted that a range of measures to reduce the primary </p><p>surplus shortfall (which the Fund estimates at 0.5 percent of </p><p>GNP) have been agreed, including indexing certain taxes, </p><p>increasing petroleum excise taxes, raising alcohol and </p><p>tobacco prices, and allocating some special revenues to the </p><p>general budget (though a final figure for the latter has not </p><p>been agreed).  Brekk noted that additional measures are </p><p>required, and the IMF does not believe the government\'s </p><p>proposal to maintain a freeze on non-essential spending is </p><p>sufficient.  However, the GOT at the political level is </p><p>balking at some suggested measures, such as raising </p><p>electricity prices. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Tight finances: Brekk noted that the overall </p><p>negative trend in the budget is essentially revenue driven, </p><p>as the government is consistently falling short on its </p><p>revenue targets (mainly due to weakness in tax and social </p><p>security contribution collections), and only making up the </p><p>shortfall by squeezing capital expenditures.  State Minister </p><p>Babacan will chair a Treasury meeting on these and other </p><p>issues related to the fifth review this evening (June 17), </p><p>before departing for a conference in London on June 18. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Tough line: Brekk stressed that the IMF will </p><p>maintain its tough approach on budget issues, as even with </p><p>additional revenues from the government\'s tax amnesty, there </p><p>are "no excess revenues."  He reiterated that this has been a </p><p>hard message to sell in the government, as few ministers have </p><p>understood the country\'s true financial situation, and </p><p>instead have been living in a false "psychology of excess </p><p>revenue."  Brekk noted that the Treasury\'s cash position is </p><p>very tight.  He predicted that it would "scrape by" in </p><p>tomorrow\'s large (TL 6.4 quadrillion auction), but would not </p><p>have much to spare.  One reason for the lack of cash, despite </p><p>good rollover rates, is the fact that the Treasury had to pay </p><p>out some USD 1.4 billion in April that had been collected in </p><p>enforced savings accounts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) June Targets: Brekk conceded that any delay into </p><p>July will automatically bring into full play tough </p><p>end-of-June financial targets.  Given that data will not be </p><p>available until August, however, the government will have to </p><p>seek a "waiver of applicability," requiring it to make an </p><p>effective case that the data will show it met the targets. </p><p>"Strong measures will help," he emphasized.  Brekk added that </p><p>to date the Fund has given no consideration to the idea of </p><p>merging the fifth and sixth reviews, and that he would argue </p><p>strongly against the idea.  Any such proposal, he argued, </p><p>would "reward bad behavior," and move the IMF away from its </p><p>policy of regular bimonthly and quarterly reviews to keep the </p><p>pressure on the Turkish government to proceed with program </p><p>implementation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Quiet Markets: Meanwhile, Turkish markets remained </p><p>flat on June 17, with the stock exchange rising from Monday\'s </p><p>close of 11,036 to 11,169, while the lira strengthened </p><p>slightly to 1.414 million (from 1.417).  Brekk noted that he </p><p>had seen some weakening in markets earlier in the day, based </p><p>on concern about Prime Minister Erdogan\'s apparent flirtation </p><p>with the "Malaysia model" on his Asian trip, but "modestly </p><p>favorable" (in one brokerage\'s estimation) budget results for </p><p>May brought some relief.  Those May figures included a </p><p>central government primary surplus of USD 1.7 billion, for a </p><p>cumulative January-May surplus of USD 5.9 billion.  Real </p><p>non-interest fiscal expenditures rose 2.9 percent, while real </p><p>revenues rose 9 percent. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
