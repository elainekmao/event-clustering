End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>DART MEETING WITH DAHUK REGIONAL GOVERNOR </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  On 20 May, the DART met with the regional governor in Dahuk, </p><p>Mr. Nechirvan Ahmed.  The governor was critical of Coalition </p><p>forces for bringing back Ba\'athists to Domiz, a Dahuk suburb. </p><p>Arabs who were living there fled during the conflict and the </p><p>Kurdish Democratic Party (KDP) took over the town.  However, on 7 </p><p>May, Coalition forces evicted Kurds who had recently moved into </p><p>Domiz and began allowing the Arabs to return. </p><p> </p><p>3.  The DART later visited Domiz, a somewhat run-down Western- </p><p>style development that was originally built by a French oil </p><p>company.  Coalition forces in Domiz explained that Kurds had </p><p>recently bought 54 houses and that there were around 160 Kurdish </p><p>families out of 900 in the town. </p><p> </p><p>4.  The governor also noted the importance of the regional </p><p>harvest being purchased but was unsure of U.N. Security Council </p><p>Resolution 986 restrictions.  The DART informed the governor that </p><p>restrictions on local purchases in the northern governorates were </p><p>no longer in effect, and that a plan was being prepared to </p><p>purchase part of the harvest. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>MINISTRY OF HUMANITARIAN AID AND COOPERATION </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  The Ministry of Humanitarian Aid and Cooperation (MOHAC) </p><p>hosted its weekly coordination meeting on 21 May.  Non- </p><p>governmental organizations continue to arrive in northern Iraq </p><p>and are using this meeting to introduce themselves to the rest of </p><p>the humanitarian community.  While the MOHAC meetings serve a </p><p>purpose, there is widespread interest in reducing the number of </p><p>sectoral meetings held each week (there are meetings every day). </p><p>This issue was discussed, and MOHAC and the Civil Military </p><p>Operations Center (CMOC) will be looking at options, such as </p><p>rotating meetings or having monthly or bi-weekly vs. weekly </p><p>meetings.  A suggested schedule will be presented in the near </p><p>future. </p><p> </p><p>6.  MOHAC and the United Nations Office for Project Services </p><p>(UNOPS) are now discussing internally displaced persons (IDPs) </p><p>and return issues.  UNOPS has been conducting a survey of IDPs to </p><p>determine where they live, where they plan to return, and when </p><p>they plan to return.  UNOPS was scheduled to present the results </p><p>at a 17 May meeting in Arbil, but asked for more time to compile </p><p>the results of their survey. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>FOOD AND AGRICULTURE </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  On 22 May, the DART traveled to Zemmar in Ninawa governorate </p><p>to attend a meeting to discuss how the current harvest would be </p><p>shared between the Arabs and the Kurds and upcoming plans to </p><p>purchase a portion of the harvest.  The meeting was chaired by </p><p>Coalition forces and attended by governorate and local officials </p><p>and local Kurdish and Arab leaders.  While the Coalition </p><p>spokesperson acknowledged that the land issue was an extremely </p><p>critical one, with a history of "over 30 years of oppression," he </p><p>said that it would have to be resolved in the courts, after the </p><p>harvest, not in the meeting.  At the appropriate time, he said, </p><p>claimants would produce land and ancestry documentation, and </p><p>ownership would be resolved and enforced by the rule of law. </p><p> </p><p>8.  Despite the Coalition representative\'s efforts, much of the </p><p>discussion still centered on land issues.  There was much tension </p><p>between the Kurdish and Arab participants, and the Arabs at one </p><p>point stood up en masse to walk out of the meeting (but ended up </p><p>sitting back down). </p><p> </p><p>9.  The Coalition representative announced that the current </p><p>harvest purchase prices were USD 80 per MT for wheat and USD 60 </p><p>per MT for barley.  He noted that he had personally told the </p><p>Presidential Envoy to Iraq, Paul Bremer, that these were too low, </p><p>and he hoped they could be raised to USD 105 per MT for wheat and </p><p>USD 65 per MT for barley.  Arab farmers expressed displeasure </p><p>that these prices were still too low, noting that the wheat price </p><p>received last year, 150,000 Old Iraqi Dinar per MT, was now </p><p>equivalent to approximately USD 150 per MT. </p><p> </p><p>10.  While neither side was happy with the Coalition-proposed 50 </p><p>- 50 split of the harvest between the original (Kurdish) owners </p><p>and those who currently control the land (Arab farmers), the </p><p>Coalition representative announced that there would be no further </p><p>discussion on the issue. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>VISIT TO TALL\'AFAR </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>10.  At the request of the United Nations World Food Program </p><p>(WFP), whose international staff cannot access grain silos </p><p>outside of Mosul in Ninawa governorate due to U.N. security </p><p>restrictions, the DART visited the Tall\'Afar silo, approximately </p><p>70 kilometers west of Mosul.  There they met with Coalition </p><p>forces and Iraqi staff at the complex.  WFP plans to import </p><p>approximately 136,000 MT of wheat to the Mosul area from Syria in </p><p>5,000 MT per day increments beginning in the next few days, and </p><p>storage space is needed. </p><p> </p><p>11.  The silo was not looted as it was protected by local </p><p>security guards (it is now protected by Coalition forces) and </p><p>currently functions well.  Its 33 bins have a capacity of </p><p>approximately 75,000 MT, with outer underground and open bin </p><p>capacity of approximately 50,000 MT. </p><p> </p><p>12.  Staff at the silo noted that the complex currently held </p><p>approximately 50,000 MT of wheat, and was releasing around 800 MT </p><p>daily to Mosul mills. The staff believed that it could receive </p><p>1,000 MT per day (shoveled out manually).  Up to 1,500 MT per day </p><p>could be received if two shifts were employed, as often is </p><p>arranged at the peak of the harvest season.  The silo staff did </p><p>receive the USD 20 emergency payments, but they are concerned </p><p>about their salaries. </p><p> </p><p>13.  Regarding the WFP Oil for Food incoming stocks, the silo </p><p>authorities were informed that they would receive 25,000 MT at </p><p>1,000 MT per day.  They stressed that this should not present a </p><p>major problem.  In short, the Tall\'Afar silo appears ready to </p><p>receive the quantities proposed by WFP, but WFP staff will need </p><p>to be present during the offloading to prevent any delays, which </p><p>requires a relaxing of the current security restrictions for WFP </p><p>international staff. </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
