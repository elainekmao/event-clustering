<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ROME 001834 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EUR/WE, EUR/RPM, EUR/ERA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/30/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, IT, NATO, ESDP </p><p>SUBJECT: ESDP MINI SUMMIT - FRATTINI WILL COME OUT SWINGING </p><p>AT GYMNICH </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) STATE 109725 B) ROME 1776 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: POL MINISTER COUNSELOR TOM COUNTRYMAN.  REASON: 1.5 (B)( </p><p>D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SANDRO DE BERNADIN, ESDP DIRECTOR IN THE MFA EUROPEAN </p><p>INTEGRATION BUREAU, TOLD POLOFF THAT THE GOI WAS AS SURPRISED </p><p>AS THE USG WITH THE CONTENT OF THE BELGIAN MINI-SUMMIT </p><p>COMMUNIQUE.  HE REITERATED STRONG GOI POSITION OUTLINED REF </p><p>B: THE GOI WILL NOT SUPPORT ANY INITIATIVE THAT WILL </p><p>UNDERMINE OR DUPLICATE THE NATO.  DE BERNADIN SAID THAT MFA </p><p>FRATTINI WOULD MAKE CLEAR TO HIS COUNTERPARTS AT THE GYMNICH </p><p>IN RHODES THAT THE BELGIAN SUMMIT DOCUMENT IS UNACCEPTABLE; </p><p>HE WILL ADVISE ALL THAT WILL LISTEN AGAINST ACCEPTING ITS </p><p>PROPOSALS, AND WILL ENCOURAGE ALL EU MEMBERS TO BRING THE </p><p>DISCUSSION OF CFSP AND ESDP "BACK TO 15." </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  DE BERNADIN SAID HE HAD BEEN IN A MEETING WITH </p><p>FRATTINI JUST PRIOR TO HIS CONVERSATION WITH POLOFF. </p><p>FRATTINI WAS "VERY UPSET AND SURPRISED" ABOUT THE LANGUAGE IN </p><p>THE DECLARATION, BUT HOPED THAT IT WAS DESIGNED TO BE A </p><p>"CATALYST, OR SHOCK" TO ENCOURAGE MOVEMENT ON ESDP. </p><p>FRATTINI\'S NIGHTMARE SCENARIO, SAID DE BERNADIN, WAS A </p><p>"MINI-ALLIANCE OF FOUR," COMPETING FOR RESOURCES AND </p><p>PERSONNEL NOT ONLY WITH NATO, BUT WITH ESDP ITSELF.  FRATTINI </p><p>WOULD DO ALL HE COULD AT THE MAY 2 GYMNICH AND IN THE RUN-UP </p><p>TO THE THESSALONIKI SUMMIT TO MOVE THE OTHER FMS AWAY FROM </p><p>SUCH A SCENARIO. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) FRATTINI\'S DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF, PASQUALE TERRACIANO, </p><p>CONVEYED THE SAME MESSAGE TO POL MC.  FRATTINI WAS READY TO </p><p>DEPLOY THE SAME ARGUMENTS HE DID REF B IN ORDER TO PREVENT </p><p>THE GANG OF FOUR FROM ADVANCING THEIR INITIATIVE.  POL MC </p><p>ASKED IF THE FM WOULD REPEAT HIS OFFER TO ORGANIZE A </p><p>COUNTER-CONFERENCE OF ITALY, SPAIN AND THE UK.  PROBABLY NOT, </p><p>ANSWERED TERRACCIANO BUT HE WOULD NOT HESITATE TO SPEAK OUT </p><p>PUBLICLY AS WELL AS IN THE CLOSED GYMNICH SESSION. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  COMMENT:  THE MINI-SUMMIT DOCUMENT IS A BLOW NOT </p><p>ONLY TO ITALY\'S VIEWS ON THE PRIMACY OF NATO AND BERLIN-PLUS </p><p>IN TRANSATLANTIC SECURITY, BUT ALSO TO THE GOI\'S HOPES FOR A </p><p>SUCCESSFUL, POSITIVE EU PRESIDENCY.  FIRST, THE WAR IN IRAQ </p><p>SERIOUSLY JEOPARDIZED CHANCES FOR COMPLETING THE CONVENTION </p><p>AND INTER-GOVERNMENTAL CONFERENCE IN TIME FOR A SECOND </p><p>"TREATY OF ROME" DURING THE ITALIAN PRESIDENCY.  NOW, THERE </p><p>IS A GOOD CHANCE THE ITALIAN PRESIDENCY WILL HAVE TO EXPEND </p><p>CONSIDERABLE POLITICAL CAPITAL IN KEEPING THE UNION FROM </p><p>DRIFTING FURTHER APART OVER THIS ISSUE, RATHER THAN FOCUSING </p><p>ON PM BERLUSCONI\'S GOAL OF CLOSING THE TRANSATLANTIC RIFT. </p><p>WE EXPECT THEREFORE THAT FRATTINI AND BERLUSCONI WILL WORK </p><p>HARD BETWEEN NOW AND JULY 1 TO MOVE THE EU SECURITY DIALOGUE </p><p>BACK ON THE RIGHT TRACK. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p>2003ROME01834 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
