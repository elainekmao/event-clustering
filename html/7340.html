<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 GUATEMALA 000962 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>HARARE FOR BRUCE WHARTON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PREL, KJUS, GT </p><p>SUBJECT: OMINOUS SIGNS COME IN THREES: LATEST HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>SETBACKS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. 02 GUATEMALA 3160 </p><p> </p><p>     B. 02 GUATEMALA 3213 </p><p>     C. 02 GUATEMALA 3275 </p><p>     D. GUATEMALA 884 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Both in the capital and farther afield, new human </p><p>rights concerns are popping up in Guatemala.  To the north, </p><p>in Quiche, a Mayan priest and human rights activist was </p><p>murdered; to the east, in Izabal, the Human Rights Ombudsman </p><p>(PDH) Auxiliary office was ransacked; here in the Guatemala </p><p>City, the home of Nineth Montenegro (New Nation Alliance </p><p>(ANN) Congresswoman and Mutual Support Group (GAM) founder) </p><p>and Mario Polanco (GAM Director) was robbed.  Embassy </p><p>inquiries and efforts to support activists continue, as shown </p><p>in the Peccerelli case, but deteriorating security conditions </p><p>and governmental apathy remain troubling.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Violence Strikes Again in Quiche </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Diego Xon Salazar, a Mayan priest, was found dead </p><p>Saturday, April 5, in Quiche province.  Xon Salazar had </p><p>reportedly been receiving death threats due to his active </p><p>role in GAM, a human rights NGO, and his protest of the </p><p>resurgence of the ex-civilian patrollers (ex-PACs) in </p><p>war-torn Quiche.  GAM is denouncing the GOG for knowledge of </p><p>death threats against Xon Salazar and refusal to provide </p><p>protection.  An investigation of his death remains pending. </p><p>This is the second murder of a Mayan indigenous activist in </p><p>six months, the first being Antonio Pop Caal of Alta Verapaz </p><p>in October 2002. (Ref A) </p><p> </p><p>Auxiliary Ombudsmen at Risk? </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Waldemar Barerra, Auxiliary Ombudsman in Izabal </p><p>province, reported that he was assaulted and his offices </p><p>ransacked in early April.  Barerra reported that his </p><p>investigation reports and computer equipment were stolen, but </p><p>valuable items were left behind, leading him to believe that </p><p>the thieves were politically and not economically motivated. </p><p>Barerra\'s office has been involved in a number of high </p><p>profile cases, such as the Chocon case, involving the former </p><p>anti-narcotics police, and the murder of journalist Mynor </p><p>Alegria, as well as the investigation of many campesino </p><p>killings. (Ref B) </p><p> </p><p>Domestic Tranquility Shattered </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Professionally active and powerful, yet personally </p><p>private, duo Nineth Montenegro and Mario Polanco were </p><p>victimized on April 7, when five armed men stormed their home </p><p>and robbed them of property valued over 100,000 quetzals </p><p>(12,500 dollars) and issued threats to Polanco, who was in </p><p>Geneva with a delegation of human rights leaders.  Montenegro </p><p>is an outspoken leftist congresswomen known for her work </p><p>against impunity and for transparency.  Polanco is the </p><p>Director of GAM and is very involved with the human right\'s </p><p>movement\'s proposal for a Commission to Investigate Illegal </p><p>Bodies and the Clandestine Security Apparatus (CICIACS). (Ref </p><p>C) </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) The Ambassador called Montenegro on April 7, to </p><p>express our concern and to inform her that he had spoken with </p><p>both Minister of Government Reyes Calderon and Police Chief </p><p>Manchame to push for a quick investigation and immediate </p><p>police protection of Montenegro, Polanco, and their family. </p><p>Montenegro thanked the Ambassador and promised to inform the </p><p>Embassy of further developments.  DCM and Human Rights poloff </p><p>met with Vice Minister of Government Caceres on April 10 and </p><p>pressed him to provide all possible protections. </p><p> </p><p>Peccerelli Update </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) Following-up on Ambassador\'s March 31 meeting with </p><p>Minister of Government Reyes Calderon (Ref D), DCM and HROff </p><p>escorted Guatemalan Forensic Anthropology Foundation (FAFG) </p><p>Director Fredy Peccerelli to a meeting with Vice Minister of </p><p>Government Caceres.  DCM thanked Caceres for the police </p><p>protection the MOG has provided the FAFG in the past, and </p><p>asked him to consider the personal details and perimeter </p><p>security that Peccerelli requested in response to recent </p><p>death threats.  Caceres agreed to do so immediately and faxed </p><p>the Embassy a copy of his official order to the police for </p><p>Peccerelli\'s protection within three hours of the meeting. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) While deflating, these recent attacks re-enforce the </p><p>need for continued USG pressure to push for the protection of </p><p>human rights in the Capital and in the countryside.  We will </p><p>continue to lobby the GOG for investigations of these </p><p>egregious murders and robberies, as well as protection for </p><p>those human rights leaders and government entities who </p><p>soldier on despite such glaring obstacles and setbacks. </p><p>HAMILTON </p><p></p></div>
