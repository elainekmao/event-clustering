PROJECT DESCRIPTION </p><p> </p><p>This project is designed to strengthen the Honduran Ministry </p><p>of Public Security as a civilian law enforcement organization </p><p>operating as an integral part of the criminal justice system. </p><p>Toward that goal, the USG and the Government of Honduras </p><p>shall take actions and commit resources on an annual basis as </p><p>authorized by their respective legislative processes to </p><p>support this LOA. </p><p> </p><p>Actions to be taken include providing the services of a full- </p><p>time law enforcement development advisor, other technical </p><p>assistance, training, purchase of equipment, materials and </p><p>supplies needed by the Ministry to improve the organizational </p><p>effectiveness and implement key criminal laws in </p><p>collaboration with other institutions of the justice system, </p><p>in particular the Public Ministry.  The planned life of this </p><p>project is two (2) years, following which time the Ministry </p><p>of Public Security will have developed a strong </p><p>partnership with the Public Ministry and other investigative </p><p>elements of the Government of Honduras and high priority </p><p>crimes will be routinely prosecuted in accordance with the </p><p>Criminal Procedure Code.  The Government of Honduras will be </p><p>expected to provide appropriate budgetary and other support </p><p>to the Ministry of Public Security and cooperating </p><p>organizations to maintain both the specialized investigative </p><p>task forces, including trained personnel, and other </p><p>improvements to organizational structure or equipment </p><p>obtained through this project. </p><p> </p><p>The Parties may increase, amend, or terminate projects </p><p>undertaken in conjunction with this LOA as agreed to by the </p><p>Parties in writing.  Such project shall be subject to the </p><p>terms and conditions of this LOA. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  III.
