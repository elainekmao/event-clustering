<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ROME 000468 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>C O R R E C T E D C O P Y - TEXT </p><p> </p><p>FROM U.S. MISSION TO UN AGENCIES IN ROME </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR IO/EDA, IO/S/SC, AND L/UNA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: AORC, KUNR, KUNR, FAOAORC, FAO </p><p>SUBJECT: FAO: HELMS-BIDEN - CURRENT STATUS </p><p> </p><p>REF:  (A) STATE 9952, (B) 11/23/01 EMAIL PODOLSKY/ </p><p> </p><p>HEILEMAN, (C) 1/16/02 EMAIL HEILEMAN/PODALSKY, (D) 01 </p><p>STATE 178759, (E) 00 ROME 3137 </p><p> </p><p>1. THIS CABLE SUMMARIZES THE CURRENT STATUS OF WHERE FAO </p><p>STANDS REGARDING HELMS-BIDEN PROVISIONS ON (A) THE </p><p>INSPECTOR GENERAL FUNCTION, (B) PROGRAM EVALUATION, AND </p><p>(C) SUNSET PROVISIONS.  MISSION REQUESTS DEPARTMENT\'S </p><p>GUIDANCE IF ANY FURTHER ACTION IS REQUIRED BEFORE A </p><p>RECOMMENDATION COULD BE MADE TO THE SECRETARY THAT FAO </p><p>HAS MET THE TRANCHE THREE REQUIREMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>INSPECTOR GENERAL </p><p>----------------- </p><p>2. PER REF A, FAO HAS ADEQUATELY MET ALL H-B REQUIREMENTS </p><p>REGARDING THE INSPECTOR GENERAL FUNCTION. </p><p> </p><p>PROGRAM EVALUATION </p><p>------------------ </p><p>3. FOLLOWING ARE RESPONSES TO THE QUESTIONS POSED IN REF </p><p>B.  THEY SUMMARIZE THE INFORMATION PROVIDED BY FAO\'S </p><p>OFFICE OF PROGRAM, BUDGET, AND EVALUATION THAT WAS </p><p>FORWARDED TO THE DEPARTMENT IN REF C. </p><p> </p><p>-- A. ARE "AUTO-EVALUATIONS" REQUIRED FOR PROGRAMS OTHER </p><p>THAN TECHNICAL AND ECONOMIC PROGRAMS? </p><p> </p><p>IN PRINCIPLE ALL PROGRAMS, OTHER THAN FIELD PROJECTS, ARE </p><p>SUBJECT TO AUTO-EVALUATIONS.  HOWEVER, GUIDELINES ARE YET </p><p>TO BE DEVELOPED FOR AUTO-EVALUATIONS OF OPERATIONAL </p><p>PROGRAMS AND ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIVITIES -- FAO EXPECTS TO </p><p>HAVE THEM COMPLETED BY AUTUMN.  THE TECHNICAL AND </p><p>ECONOMIC PROGRAMS, ABOUT 45 PERCENT OF FAO\'S PROGRAM </p><p>BUDGET, ARE THE FIRST PRIORITY.  FIELD PROJECTS, AS </p><p>OUTLINED IN THE DG\'S BULLETIN, ARE SUBJECT TO INDEPENDENT </p><p>TRI-PARTITE EVALUATIONS OR TO "THEMATIC EVALUATIONS." </p><p></p><p>(NOTE: DEFINITIONS OF THESE VARIOUS TYPES OF PROGRAMS ARE </p><p>FOUND IN THE CHARTS OF REF C.) </p><p> </p><p>-- B. WHAT ARE CONTINUING PROGRAM ACTIVITIES? </p><p> </p><p>PARAGRAPH 62 OF THE MEDIUM TERM PLAN DEFINES THE THREE </p><p>TYPES OF ACTIVITIES UNDER A SUBSTANTIVE FAO PROGRAM: </p><p>TECHNICAL PROJECTS (SET ACTIONS WITH A DURATION OF UP TO </p><p>SIX YEARS), CONTINUING PROGRAMS (A PRODUCTION OF OUTPUTS </p><p>WHICH ARE NOT OF A TIME-BOUND NATURE, SUCH AS THE </p><p>COLLECTION OF STATISTICS), AND TECHNICAL SERVICE </p><p>AGREEMENTS (SERVICES WHICH CANNOT BE PROJECTED FAR IN </p><p>ADVANCE SUCH AS TECHNICAL ADVICE TO A COUNTRY). </p><p> </p><p>-- C. WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AN ANNUAL ASSESSMENT </p><p>AND AN AUTO EVALUATION? </p><p> </p><p>AN ANNUAL ASSESSMENT IS FOR IN-HOUSE MONITORING BY THE </p><p>WORKING-LEVEL OFFICERS INVOLVED.  AN AUTO EVALUATION IS A </p><p>MORE FORMAL PROCEDURE WHICH LEADS TO RECOMMENDATIONS BY </p><p>PROGRAM MANAGERS TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT REGARDING THE </p><p>PROGRAM\'S FUTURE.  AS A MORE FORMAL PROCEDURE, THE AUTO </p><p>EVALUATION PROCESS WOULD INVOLVE "EXTERNAL INPUTS" (E.G., </p><p>CONSULTANTS OR MEMBERS OF PEER GROUPS SUCH AS IFAD OR AN </p><p>NGO).  IT WOULD NORMALLY BE CARRIED OUT AT LEAST ONCE </p><p>EVERY SIX YEARS, AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT ACTS ON ITS </p><p>RECOMMENDATIONS AS PART OF THE MEDIUM TERM PLAN </p><p>PROCEDURE. </p><p> </p><p>-- D. AS REQUESTED, SECTION 107.11 FROM THE ORGANIZATION </p><p>STAFF MANUAL, DEFINING THE ROLE OF THE EVALUATION </p><p>SERVICE, WAS FORWARDED TO IO/S IN REF C. </p><p> </p><p>-- E. WILL FUTURE FAO PROGRAM EVALUATION REPORTS (PER) </p><p>ADDRESS AUTO EVALUATIONS? </p><p> </p><p>A SYNTHESIS OF AUTO EVALUATION REPORTS PREPARED EVERY </p><p>BIENNIUM WILL BE SUBMITTED TO THE DIRECTOR GENERAL AND TO </p><p>THE PROGRAM COMMITTEE.  ONLY A SUMMARY OF THIS DOCUMENT </p><p>WILL BE INCLUDED IN THE PER.  AS A PROGRAM COMMITTEE </p><p>DOCUMENT, HOWEVER, THE SYNTHESIS WILL BE AVAILABLE TO ALL </p><p>MEMBERS THROUGH THE INTERNET.  THE COMMITTEE\'S VIEWS ON </p><p>THE SYNTHESIS WILL BE INCLUDED IN ITS REPORT TO THE </p><p>COUNCIL. </p><p> </p><p>-- F. HOW WILL THE DG REPORT RESULTS OF AUTO EVALUATIONS </p><p>AND PROPOSE TO CHANGE/TERMINATE PROGRAMS? </p><p> </p><p>GUIDELINES REQUIRE THAT AUTO EVALUATIONS INCLUDE SPECIFIC </p><p>PROPOSALS FOR THE NEXT MTP PERIOD.  TECHNICAL PROJECTS </p><p>WILL LAPSE UNLESS PROPOSALS PUT FORWARD A CASE FOR </p><p>CONTINUATION.  PROPOSALS MUST INDICATE WHETHER CONTINUING </p><p>PROGRAMS SHOULD BE CONTINUED, MODIFIED, OR TERMINATED. </p><p> </p><p></p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 02 ROME 000468 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>C O R R E C T E D C O P Y - TEXT </p><p> </p><p>FROM U.S. MISSION TO UN AGENCIES IN ROME </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR IO/EDA, IO/S/SC, AND L/UNA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: AORC, KUNR, FAO </p><p>SUBJECT: FAO: HELMS-BIDEN - CURRENT STATUS </p><p> </p><p>THE SYNTHESIS GOING TO THE PROGRAM COMMITTEE WILL LIST </p><p>ALL THESE PROPOSALS. </p><p> </p><p>-- G. THE PROGRAM COMMITTEE RECEIVES INDEPENDENT </p><p>EVALUATION REPORTS THAT IT SELECTS.  CAN IT ALSO SELECT </p><p>INDIVIDUAL AUTO EVALUATION REPORTS FOR A CLOSER REVIEW? </p><p>THE VOLUME OF AUTO EVALUATION REPORTS PREPARED EACH </p><p>BIENNIUM, AND THE COST OF TRANSLATING THESE INTO FIVE </p><p>LANGUAGES, MAKES IT IMPRACTICAL TO PROVIDE THESE TO THE </p><p>PROGRAM COMMITTEE.  (159 TECHNICAL AND ECONOMIC PROGRAM </p><p>AUTO EVALUATIONS WILL HAVE TO BE PRODUCED, MOST OF THEM </p><p>PROBABLY BUNCHED TOWARD THE END OF THIS FIRST SIX-YEAR </p><p>MTP PERIOD.)  THE COMMITTEE RECEIVES ONLY THE SYNTHESIS </p><p>OF ALL AUTO EVALUATIONS.  IN PRINCIPLE, THE COMMITTEE </p><p>COULD ON AN "EXCEPTIONAL BASIS" REQUEST A COPY OF AN AUTO </p><p>EVALUATION, BUT AS AN INTERNAL FAO DOCUMENT IT WOULD </p><p>REMAIN THE DG\'S PREROGATIVE TO ACCEDE TO SUCH A REQUEST. </p><p> </p><p>-- H. HOW WOULD THE PROGRAM COMMITTEE MAKE </p><p>RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE FAO COUNCIL ON IMPROVING OR </p><p>TERMINATING PROGRAMS? </p><p> </p><p>THE COMMITTEE HAS TWO MEANS BY WHICH TO COMMENT:  MAKE </p><p>RECOMMENDATIONS THROUGH ITS REPORTING ON THE SYNTHESIS OF </p><p>AUTO EVALUATIONS, AND/OR USE THE MEDIUM TERM PLAN TO </p><p>EXPRESS IT\'S VIEWS ON PROGRAM PRIORITIES. </p><p> </p><p>SUNSET (U.S. POLICY) </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>4. THE UNITED STATES MISSION CONTINUES TO SEEK ACTION BY </p><p>FAO IMPLEMENTING SPECIFIC TERMINATION DATES FOR ALL </p><p>PROGRAMS, SO THAT PROGRAMS WILL NOT BE RENEWED UNLESS AN </p><p>EVALUATION DEMONSTRATES ITS CONTINUED RELEVANCE AND </p><p>EFFECTIVENESS -- A.K.A., SUNSET PROVISIONS.  OVER THE </p><p>PAST SEVERAL YEARS OUR VIEWS HAVE PLAYED A ROLE IN THE </p><p>FAO\'S MOVES TO DEVELOP A FAMILY OF NEW PLANNING, </p><p>BUDGETING, AND ACCOUNTABILITY DOCUMENTS.  THE TWO CORE </p><p>DOCUMENTS, THE STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK AND THE MEDIUM TERM </p><p>PLAN 2002-2007 (MTP), REFLECT A SIGNIFICANT SHIFT TOWARD </p><p>SUNSETTING AND RESULT-BASED BUDGETING.  THE MTP APPROVED </p><p>AT THE NOVEMBER 2000 COUNCIL DEFINES FORTY-FIVE PERCENT </p><p>OF THE FAO\'S TECHNICAL AND ECONOMIC PROGRAMS AS TECHNICAL </p><p>PROJECTS, MEANING THEY HAVE A DURATION OF NO MORE THAN </p><p>SIX YEARS AND CANNOT BE EXTENDED UNLESS EVALUATIONS </p><p>CONFIRM THEIR EFFECTIVENESS.  AS DESCRIBED ABOVE, OTHER </p><p>TECHNICAL AND ECONOMIC PROGRAMS ALSO REQUIRE AN </p><p>EVALUATION TO DETERMINE RELEVANCE AND EFFECTIVENESS AT </p><p>LEAST ONCE EVERY SIX YEARS.  THIS REPRESENTS A MARKED </p><p>IMPROVEMENT OVER THE 2000-01 FAO PROGRAM OF WORK AND </p><p>BUDGET BUT WE CONTINUE TO SEEK A STRENGTHENING OF SUNSET </p><p>PROVISIONS. </p><p> </p><p>5. CONTINUING DISCUSSIONS WITH FAO OFFICIALS AND WITH </p><p>OTHER FAO MEMBERS SUGGEST THAT THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO </p><p>DO THIS IS THROUGH SEEKING CONTINUED STRENGTHENING OF THE </p><p>MTP AND THE EVALUATION PROCESS.  MANY FAO MEMBERS ARE </p><p>LEERY OF OUR MOTIVATION, BELIEVING THAT WE SEEK </p><p>SUNSETTING NOT AS A STEP TOWARD BETTER MANAGEMENT BUT AS </p><p>A MEANS OF REDUCING OUR CONTRIBUTION.  A RESOLUTION </p><p>CALLING FOR AN IMMEDIATE TERMINATION DATE ON ALL PROJECTS </p><p>IS UNLIKELY TO CLEAR EITHER FAO\'S FINANCE COMMITTEE OR </p><p>COUNCIL, AND WILL MAKE SOME MEMBERS MORE SUSPICIOUS OF </p><p>ANY EFFORT TO IMPROVE THE MTP.  IN RESPONSE TO A QUESTION </p><p>FROM THE U.S. PERMREP ON SUNSETTING AT THE MAY 2000 JOINT </p><p>PROGRAM/FINANCE COMMITTEE, THE DIRECTOR OF FAO\'S OFFICE </p><p>OF PROGRAM, BUDGET AND EVALUATION URGED THAT MEMBERS SHOW </p><p>PATIENCE IN PUSHING FOR CHANGE (REF E). </p><p> </p><p>6. THE MISSION WILL CONTINUE PRIVATELY TO STRESS TO </p><p>MEMBERS THE MANAGERIAL BENEFITS OF SUNSET PROVISIONS, AND </p><p>THE FACT THAT FAR FROM REDUCING FAO\'S BUDGET, THESE </p><p>IMPROVEMENTS ARE LIKELY TO MAKE DONORS MORE WILLING TO </p><p>CONTRIBUTE.  WE WILL CONTINUE TO DISCUSS INFORMALLY A </p><p>SUNSET RESOLUTION AMONG DONORS IN THE GENEVA GROUP.  IT </p><p>SHOULD BE NOTED THAT BOTH THE 1999 AND THE 2000 ANNUAL </p><p>GENEVA GROUP REPORTS INCLUDED A PUSH FOR BETTER RESULTS- </p><p>BASED BUDGETING ON THE GROUP\'S "TO-DO" LIST.  THE 2001 </p><p>REPORT, CURRENTLY BEING DRAFTED, WILL DO LIKEWISE. </p><p>HEILEMAN </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p>2002ROME00468 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
