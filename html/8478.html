<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 001135 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR J. FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR C. GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR C. NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR T. PFLAUMER </p><p>BANGKOK FOR W. DAYTON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, ZI, Media and Communications, Parliamentary Affairs </p><p>SUBJECT: "NEW" MEDIA AMENDMENT TOPS PARLIAMENT AGENDA </p><p> </p><p>REF: HARARE 874 </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p>1.  Parliament resumes on June 10, after a two-week </p><p>adjournment, to allow legislators to review the new text of </p><p>the Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Amendment </p><p>Bill introduced by Minister Patrick Chinamasa on May 13.  The </p><p>new text is by-and-large the old amendments with only one </p><p>substantive change pertaining to the composition of the </p><p>regulatory authority.  Parliament will most likely debate the </p><p>fate of and dismiss Tafadzwa Musekiwa, MDC MP for Zengeza, </p><p>who has missed 21 consecutive days of Parliament.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>AIPPA STILL ON THE TABLE </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2. On June 10, Parliament will resume debate on the Access to </p><p>Information and Protection of Privacy Act (AIPPA) Bill, after </p><p>a two-week adjournment during which legislators reviewed the </p><p>new text Minister of Justice, Legal, and Parliamentary </p><p>Affairs Patrick Chinamasa introduced on May 13, 2003. </p><p>Chinamasa introduced and got passed a motion that the text of </p><p>the AIPPA Bill be treated as having already been introduced, </p><p>which means the new version of the Bill will not be </p><p>re-gazetted nor will it go through the Parliamentary Legal </p><p>Committee (PLC).  It is unclear whether the passage of this </p><p>motion means the Bill will be fast-tracked, preventing debate </p><p>on the portfolio committee,s report. </p><p> </p><p>3. The government will meet with the PLC on June 5 and 6 to </p><p>try to avert an adverse report.  If the government is </p><p>successful in forestalling such a report, the Bill could </p><p>proceed to the Second Reading and the House could suspend the </p><p>necessary Standing Orders to circumvent the portfolio </p><p>committee and get this legislation passed into law before </p><p>this year,s Parliamentary Session adjourns.  (NOTE: </p><p>Typically, at the second reading stage, the minister explains </p><p>the bill, the portfolio committee presents its report, and </p><p>debate on the bill follows.  After the second reading, the </p><p>House goes through the bill line by line and adopts any </p><p>changes to it before it proceeds to the third reading when </p><p>Parliament passes the bill and it goes to the Head of State </p><p>for assent into law. END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>4. AIPPA became law in March 2002 and restricts the operation </p><p>of Zimbabwe,s independent and foreign journalists and media </p><p>companies.  (See Reftel).  Critics of AIPPA contend that it </p><p>contravenes the constitutional right of freedom of expression </p><p>and is meant to gag the independent media.  The Independent </p><p>Journalists Association of Zimbabwe (IJAZ) is challenging the </p><p>constitutionality of AIPPA and the hearing was scheduled to </p><p>begin June 3 but has been postponed indefinitely after </p><p>Supreme Court Chief Justice Chidyausiku, whose allegiance to </p><p>President Robert Mugabe is without question, said the court </p><p>needed time to consider the Minister of Information Jonathan </p><p>Moyo,s request to not hear the case. </p><p> </p><p>5. The new set of amendments carry some changes that the </p><p>Portfolio Committee on Transport and Communications suggested </p><p>but most of the controversial elements of the Bill remain. </p><p>Changes to the Bill include: </p><p> </p><p>--The deletion of the clause allowing the Minister of </p><p>Information and Publicity the authority to hand pick all the </p><p>members of the Media and Information Commission (MIC), the </p><p>body charged with registering, accrediting, and monitoring </p><p>mass media and journalists. </p><p> </p><p>--The deletion of a clause prohibiting owners of mass media </p><p>services that publish newspapers for sale for mass </p><p>circulation from continuing to own local mass media services. </p><p> </p><p>--The augmentation of the penalty for intentionally or </p><p>recklessly falsifying information, maliciously or </p><p>fraudulently fabricating information, or publishing any </p><p>knowingly false or reckless statement from a fine not </p><p>exceeding level seven or imprisonment not to exceed two years </p><p>to a fine not exceeding level 14 (maximum level is 15) or </p><p>imprisonment not to exceed three years. (NOTE: On May 7, the </p><p>Supreme Court ruled that this section, section 80, was </p><p>unconstitutional, violating Article 20 of the Zimbabwe </p><p>Constitution, which guarantees freedom of expression. END </p><p>NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>--The addition of a clause that would allow a foreign </p><p>journalist to stay in the country beyond the 30-day maximum </p><p>proposed before if the MIC feels that the accredited </p><p>journalist needs additional days to cover an event. </p><p> </p><p>The remaining amendments, which would expand the list of mass </p><p>media products under government control and the restriction </p><p>of foreign journalists and media operators, remain unchanged. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>ABSENT MP </p><p>--------- </p><p>6. Parliament is likely to debate the fate of Zengeza (a </p><p>high-density Harare suburb) MDC MP Tafadzwa Musekiwa, </p><p>who--having secured asylum in the UK--has missed more than </p><p>the constitutional limit of 21 consecutive days of </p><p>Parliament.  Prior to the adjournment, Chinamasa gave notice </p><p>to move a motion that Parliament declare the seat vacant. </p><p>Gibson Sibanda, MDC Vice-President, delayed debate by </p><p>promising to persuade Musekiwa to resign by the June 10 </p><p>resumption of Parliament.  When the seat becomes vacant, </p><p>there would be three parliamentary by-elections (one ZANU-PF </p><p>seat, two MDC seats) due, although the government seems in no </p><p>hurry to set dates for them (The three seats would appear </p><p>safe for the previous incumbents\' parties, i.e. two MDC and </p><p>one ZANU-PF).  To unseat Musekiwa, more than one-half of the </p><p>membership (76 people) would have to vote for his dismissal. </p><p>ZANU-PF currently has enough support between the elected MPs, </p><p>non-constituency MPs and provincial governors to exceed the </p><p>one-half mandate. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>CITIZENSHIP BILL </p><p>---------------- </p><p>7. The other bill that Parliament may work on before </p><p>concluding the Third Session is the Citizenship of Zimbabwe </p><p>Amendment Bill.  The Citizenship Bill, which exempts persons </p><p>of Southern African Development Community parentage, who may </p><p>be citizens of these countries by descent, from compliance </p><p>with the dual citizenship prohibition and the requirement to </p><p>renounce the foreign citizenship in order to keep Zimbabwean </p><p>citizenship, has not had its first reading and still needs to </p><p>be considered by the parliamentary Legal Committee.  One of </p><p>USAID,s contractors who is working on Zimbabwean </p><p>parliamentary reforms surmised that the government would try </p><p>to convince the PLC not to issue an adverse report on the </p><p>Citizenship Act amendments in their June 5 and 6 meetings. </p><p>If this happens, the House may be able to fast-track this </p><p>bill too. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p>8. The GOZ has been trying to push through the AIPPA Bill </p><p>since November 2002, when the PLC began deliberating on the </p><p>constitutionality of the Bill.  The &new8 Bill that </p><p>legislators have been reviewing keeps the most controversial </p><p>elements of the Bill and makes a few cosmetic changes.  In </p><p>particular, it will be interesting how the architects of </p><p>AIPPA will try to reconcile (or not) the Supreme Court,s </p><p>ruling that Section 80 is unconstitutional and the more </p><p>stringent punishment advocated in the new text.  The big </p><p>question of the week will be how the executive and </p><p>legislative branches of government play the last week of the </p><p>Third Session of Parliament and whether the Executive will </p><p>ram the Bill through Parliament regardless of an adverse PLC </p><p>report or portfolio committee report.  It will be a test of </p><p>the commitment of legislators to parliamentary reform.  END </p><p>COMMENT </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
