NOT FOR INTERNET DISTRIBUTION. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) ILLUSTRATING BOTH ITS REACH AND DEPTH AS ITALY\'S </p><p>LARGEST TRADE UNION CONFEDERATION, CGIL (THE GENERAL </p><p>CONFEDERATION OF ITALIAN WORKERS) BROUGHT MUCH OF ITALY TO A </p><p>CRAWL, IF NOT A COMPLETE HALT, DURING ITS ONE-DAY STRIKE </p><p>OCTOBER 18.  THE EIGHT-HOUR ACTION CREATED SUBSTANTIAL </p><p>DISRUPTION THE LENGTH OF THE PENINSULA, ESPECIALLY IN THE </p><p>TRANSPORT SECTOR.  IT ALSO GENERATED FURTHER ACRIMONY </p><p>BETWEEN CGIL AND THE OTHER TWO MAJOR CONFEDERATIONS, AS THEY </p><p>SPARRED OVER THE STRIKE\'S IMPACT AND UTILITY, THAT WILL MAKE </p><p>THEIR RECONCILIATION MORE DIFFICULT.  THE ONE-DAY STRIKE MAY </p><p>MARK THE END OF A PHASE IN WHICH THE THREE CONFEDERATIONS </p><p>HAVE SPENT MUCH OF THEIR ENERGY ARGUING AMONG THEMSELVES </p><p>OVER THEIR RELATIVE STRENGTH AND INFLUENCE RATHER THAN </p><p>PRESENTING A COMMON FRONT TO EMPLOYERS AND THE GOVERNMENT. </p><p>AT LEAST, THAT\'S WHAT POLITICAL LEADERS ACROSS THE CENTER- </p><p>LEFT HOPE.  CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD HELP THE CONFEDERATIONS </p><p>PATCH THINGS UP: THE BUDGET CRUNCH AND A CRISIS AT FIAT AUTO </p><p>HAVE PROVIDED ORGANIZED LABOR, IN ALL ITS CONFIGURATIONS, </p><p>WITH A TANGIBLE THREAT TO ITS MEMBERS THAT IS WORTH FIGHTING </p><p>OVER. </p><p> </p><p>TIMING IS EVERYTHING </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) FOR CGIL, THE GAMBLE OF CALLING A STRIKE </p><p>INDEPENDENT OF THE OTHER CONFEDERATIONS (THE SECOND IN SIX </p><p>MONTHS AFTER ALMOST 40 YEARS OF JOINT STRIKES) APPEARS TO </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  05131  01 OF 03  220544Z </p><p>HAVE PAID OFF.  BUT IT\'S FAIR TO SAY THAT THE CONFEDERATION </p><p>WAS PERHAPS LUCKY RATHER THAN BRILLIANT.   WHEN CGIL </p><p>ORIGINALLY CALLED THE STRIKE IN JUNE, ITS MOTIVE WAS LARGELY </p><p>TO OBJECT TO THE OTHER TWO (CISL AND UIL) CONFEDERATIONS\' </p><p>DECISION TO SIGN A NEW LABOR PACT WITH THE GOVERNMENT AND </p><p>EMPLOYERS THAT INCLUDED THE BERLUSCONI GOVERNMENT\'S PROPOSED </p><p>CHANGES TO ARTICLE 18 OF THE LABOR CODE (WHICH PROVIDE SMALL </p><p>EMPLOYERS MORE FLEXIBILITY TO FIRE WORKERS).  ALTHOUGH </p><p>SYMBOLICALLY IMPORTANT, IT WAS HARDLY THE ISSUE THAT MANY </p><p>EXPECTED TO GALVANIZE PUBLIC OPINION OR PROMPT CHANGES IN </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT\'S APPROACH TO LABOR ISSUES (GIVEN THAT FEW </p><p>EXPECTED A SURGE IN SMALL FIRMS\' HIRING DUE TO THE ADDED </p><p>FLEXIBILITY). </p><p> </p><p>4.(SBU) BUT A FUNNY THING HAPPENED ON THE WAY TO THE STRIKE: </p><p>TWO ISSUES WITH ENORMOUS PRACTICAL SIGNIFICANCE EMERGED. </p><p>FIRST, THE GOVERNMENT RELEASED ITS PROPOSED 2003 BUDGET (SEE </p><p>REFTELS FOR FULL ANALYSIS) TO WIDESPREAD OPPOSITION. </p><p>FINANCE MINISTER TREMONTI PROPOSED CUTS (DESIGNED TO KEEP </p><p>ITALY IN LINE WITH EU FISCAL CRITERIA) THAT INCLUDED </p><p>SUBSTANTIAL CONSTRAINTS ON PUBLIC FUNDS TO PROMOTE ECONOMIC </p><p>DEVELOPMENT AND INVESTMENT IN SOUTHERN ITALY (WHERE </p><p>UNEMPLOYMENT RUNS ABOVE 20%).   AFTER INITIAL ANALYSES </p><p>REVEALED THE CUTS COULD JEOPARDIZE THE GOVERNMENT\'S ABILITY </p><p>TO MEET ITS UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS AND TAX REDUCTION </p><p>COMMITMENTS UNDER THE NATIONAL LABOR PACT NEGOTIATED IN </p><p>JULY, CISL AND UIL WARNED THEY WOULD HEAD FOR THE STREETS IF </p><p>THERE WERE ANY REDUCTIONS IN AGREED MEASURES OR OTHER </p><p>ALTERATIONS TO OTHER ELEMENTS OF THE PACT. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) THEN FIAT ANNOUNCED PLANS (SEE SEPTEL) TO STABILIZE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  05131  01 OF 03  220544Z </p><p>ITS AILING AUTO DIVISION WITH SHOCK THERAPY, PROPOSING PLANT </p><p>CLOSURES THAT WOULD IDLE OVER 8,000 WORKERS (INCLUDING </p><p>ALMOST 2,000 AT A PLANT IN WESTERN SICILY).  IN A SOCIETY </p><p>WHERE LABOR MOBILITY IS THE EXCEPTION (AND SOUTHERN WORKERS </p><p>ESPECIALLY RESIST HEADING NORTH FOR WORK), THE PLANNED </p><p>CLOSURES FUELED A FIRESTORM OF PROTEST.  WORKERS AT THE </p><p>SICILIAN PLANT BEGAN A SERIES OF WORK STOPPAGES AND SHUT </p><p>DOWN TRANSPORTATION ACROSS MUCH OF THE ISLAND, BLOCKING </p><p>FREEWAYS AND RAIL LINES.  LOCAL OFFICIALS AND SICILIAN </p><p>PARLIAMENTARIANS JOINED UNION LEADERS IN DENOUNCING THE </p><p>PLANNED CUTS, CHARGING THE MOVE WOULD LEAVE DISMISSED </p><p>WORKERS AND THEIR NEIGHBORS LITTLE ECONOMIC ALTERNATIVE BUT </p><p>TO COLLABORATE WITH ORGANIZED CRIME.  "DON\'T LEAVE US WITH </p><p>THE MAFIA AT THE DOOR," PLEADED THE MAYOR OF ONE TOWN.  CGIL </p><p>ASTUTELY SHIFTED THE MOTIVES FOR ITS STRIKE, DECLARING THAT </p><p>THE ACTION WAS INTENDED TO DEMONSTRATE MORE BROADLY THE </p><p>CONFEDERATION\'S OPPOSITION TO THE BERLUSCONI GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>ECONOMIC POLICY. </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) THE STRIKE PROMPTED WIDESPREAD DISRUPTION ACROSS </p><p>ITALY, AS THE CONFEDERATION STAGGERED ITS ACTIONS ACROSS THE </p><p>VARIOUS TRANSPORT SECTORS TO CREATE MAXIMUM DISRUPTION. </p><p>ALITALIA WAS FORCED TO CANCEL 275 FLIGHTS (50% OF ITS DAILY </p><p>SCHEDULE) AND NATIONAL RAIL CARRIER TRENITALIA DROPPED 40% </p><p>OF ITS MEDIUM AND LONG-HAUL ROUTES FOR THE DAY.

(U) UNION LEADERS FANNED OUT ACROSS ITALY TO RALLY THE </p><p>FAITHFUL AND SPEAK AT THE DEMONSTRATIONS.  FORMER CGIL </p><p>LEADER SERGIO COFFERATI, OSTENSIBLY THE MOST POPULAR FIGURE </p><p>WITHIN ITALY\'S FRACTURED, CONTENTIOUS CENTER-LEFT </p><p>OPPOSITION, MARCHED WITH HIS PIRELLI COLLEAGUES (AND 250,000 </p><p>OTHERS, ACCORDING TO CGIL) THROUGH MILAN JUST DAYS AFTER </p><p>REJOINING HIS EMPLOYER FOLLOWING A 20-PLUS YEAR UNION </p><p>CAREER.  HIS SUCCESSOR, GUGLIELMO EPIFANI, LED 200,000 OF </p><p>THE FAITHFUL IN TURIN (HEADQUARTERS OF FIAT\'S FAR-FLUNG </p><p>HOLDINGS, INCLUDING FIAT AUTO).  RALLIES IN ROME AND NAPLES </p><p>DREW UPWARDS OF 150,000 AND 130,000, RESPECTIVELY, INCLUDING </p><p>MANY STUDENTS.  (NOTE: ATTENDANCE ESTIMATES REPORTED BY </p><p>CGIL; INDPENDENT ESTIMATES HAVE NOT YET BEEN REPORTED BUT </p><p>COULD BE LOWER).  JOINING THE PROCESSIONS WERE MOST OF THE </p><p>OPPOSITION CENTER-LEFT PARTIES\' LEADERS; SOME WITH </p><p>CONVICTION (IN THE CASE OF COMMUNIST RENEWAL LEADER </p><p>BERTINOTTI), OTHERS WITH A DEGREE OF PUZZLEMENT (IN THE CASE </p><p>OF DEMOCRATIC LEFT LEADER PIERO FASSINO AND FORMER PM </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  05131  02 OF 03  220544Z </p><p>MASSIMO D\'ALEMA).  FASSINO URGED THE THREE CONFEDERATIONS TO </p><p>REDEVELOP A UNIFIED POSITION, SUGGESTING THE OPPOSITION </p><p>(ALREADY FRACTURED) COULD ILL-AFFORD DIVISIONS WITHIN ONE OF </p><p>ITS KEY CONSTITUENCIES. </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) THE STRIKE WAS A ROUSING SUCCESS, EPIFANI DECLARED; </p><p>CGIL HAD "BROUGHT MILLIONS INTO THE STREETS" TO PROTEST THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S ECONOMIC POLICIES.  THE CONFEDERATION ALSO </p><p>CITED HIGH PARTICIPATION IN SEVERAL SECTORS, INCLUDING OVER </p><p>50% OF TEACHERS.  PARTICIPATION WAS ESPECIALLY HIGH IN THE </p><p>HEAVILY-INDUSTRIALIZED (AND UNIONIZED) NORTHWEST, WITH 60-70 </p><p>PERCENT REPORTED AT FIAT AUTO.  IN CONTRAST, CISL AND UIL </p><p>DOWNPLAYED THE STRIKE\'S SIGNIFICANCE, CLAIMING NO MORE THAN </p><p>A THIRD OF THE WORK FORCE PARTICIPATED AND SUGGESTING THERE </p><p>HAD BEEN LITTLE CROSSOVER SUPPORT TO CGIL FROM THEIR </p><p>MEMBERS.  LABOR MINISTER MARONI CHARACTERIZED THE STRIKE AS </p><p>"MODEST," AND EXPRESSED THE GOVERNMENT\'S HOPE THAT THERE </p><p>COULD NOW BE A BROADER DIALOGUE AMONG ALL THREE PARTNERS - </p><p>LABOR, EMPLOYERS AND GOVERNMENT. </p><p> </p><p>NOW WHAT? </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) MANY OBSERVERS BELIEVE THAT, HAVING MADE ITS POINT, </p><p>CGIL WILL ONCE AGAIN FIND COMMON CAUSE WITH THE OTHER TWO </p><p>CONFEDERATIONS.  IN THE WEEKS PRECEDING THE STRIKE, EPIFANI </p><p>BEGAN HINTING AS MUCH, AVOIDING ANY SUGGESTION THE </p><p>CONFEDERATION WOULD SET CISL AND UIL\'S RENUNCIATION OF THE </p><p>SUMMER\'S LABOR PACT AS THE PRICE OF RENEWED COOPERATION. </p><p>SEVERAL OBSERVERS POINT TO EPIFANI\'S MORE MEASURED REMARKS - </p><p>IN CONTRAST TO THOSE OF HIS COLORFUL PREDECESSOR, COFFERATI, </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  05131  02 OF 03  220544Z </p><p>UNDER WHOSE LEADERSHIP CGIL CALLED THE STRIKE - AS EVIDENCE </p><p>THAT HE IS PREPARED TO MOVE ON.  BUT THE LEADERS OF THE </p><p>OTHER TWO CONFEDERATIONS BOTH SIGNALED THAT ANY </p><p>RECONCILIATION WOULD DEPEND ON CGIL\'S WILLINGNESS TO MOVE IN </p><p>THEIR DIRECTION.  UIL LEADER ANGELETTI DECLARED THE STRIKE </p><p>"USELESS; IT DIDN\'T SOLVE ANYTHING," AND CISL LEADER LUIGI </p><p>PEZZOTTA SAID HE WAS "FED UP" WITH CGIL CRITICISM OF THE </p><p>NATIONAL LABOR PACT SIGNED IN JULY.  ANY DISCUSSION OF A </p><p>FORMAL UNITED FRONT - SOMETHING CISL HAD BEEN ASKING </p><p>COFFERATI AND CGIL TO DISCUSS FOR 18 MONTHS - WOULD BEGIN ON </p><p>THE BASIS OF THE LABOR PACT, PEZZOTTA DECLARED. </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) BEHIND THE RHETORIC, THOUGH, THERE ARE SIGNS THE </p><p>THREE CONFEDERATIONS ARE IDENTIFYING  COMMON GROUND. </p><p>METALWORKERS FROM THE CONSTITUENT UNIONS OF THE THREE </p><p>CONFEDERATIONS ARE DISCUSSING A COMMON STRATEGY AND TACTICS </p><p>TO TACKLE FIAT AUTO\'S RESTRUCTURING PLANS AND REPORTEDLY ARE </p><p>CONTEMPLATING A SECTORWIDE STRIKE IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS. </p><p>THIS TECHNICAL-LEVEL COLLABORATION MAY LEAD TO BROADER </p><p>DISCUSSIONS BY CONFEDERATION LEADERSHIP OF A SHARED </p><p>FRAMEWORK.  FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE AT LEAST, THAT SHOULDN\'T </p><p>PROVE TOO HARD; BETWEEN THE PROPOSED BUDGET AND THE FIAT </p><p>AUTO CRISIS, THERE\'S PLENTY ON WHICH THE THREE </p><p>CONFEDERATIONS SHOULD BE ABLE TO AGREE.  A UNITED FRONT </p><p>WOULD CREATE A SMOOTHER NEGOTIATING PROCESS (THOUGH PERHAPS </p><p>A MORE EXPENSIVE PRICE TAG) FOR THE BERLUSCONI GOVERNMENT AS </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ0876 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  05131  03 OF 03  220544Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00  COME-00 </p><p>      CTME-00  DODE-00  ITCE-00  DOTE-00  ANHR-00  SRPP-00  DS-00 </p><p>      EB-00    EXME-00  E-00     FAAE-00  UTED-00  VC-00    FRB-00 </p><p>      H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   ITC-01   LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00 </p><p>      AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00 </p><p>      PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SCT-00   SP-00    IRM-00   SSO-00 </p><p>      STR-00   TEST-00  TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00 </p><p>      DRL-02   G-00     SAS-00     /009W </p><p>                  ------------------FC038C  220545Z /38 </p><p>R 220459Z OCT 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 6450 </p><p>INFO DEPT OF LABOR WASHDC </p><p>EUROPEAN POLITICAL COLLECTIVE </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 03 OF 03 ROME 005131 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EUR/WE AND DRL/IL </p><p>DOL FOR ILAB/BRUMFIELD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ELAB, ECON, PGOV, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: OCTOBER 18 ITALIAN GENERAL STRIKE GENERATES </p><p>WIDESPREAD DISRUPTION </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  05131  03 OF 03  220544Z </p><p>IT TRIES TO TAME SOME OF ITALY\'S STRUCTURAL ECONOMIC </p><p>PROBLEMS WHILE PRESERVING SOME MEASURE OF INTRA-REGIONAL </p><p>HARMONY AND, IN THE FORM OF FIAT, ONE OF THE SYMBOLS OF </p><p>ITALY\'S POSTWAR ECONOMIC TRANSFORMATION FROM CRIPPLED </p><p>AGRARIAN NATION TO MODERN G-7 MEMBER.
