<p>UNCLAS BOGOTA 006886 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PHUM, PREF, CO </p><p>SUBJECT: FARC THREATS CAUSE ENTIRE TOWN TO FLEE </p><p> </p><p>1.  VIRTUALLY ALL OF THE INHABITANTS OF PUERTO ALVIRA, META </p><p>DEPARTMENT, HAVE FLED BECAUSE OF THREATENED GUERRILLA </p><p>ACTIONS.  PUERTO ALVIRA IS ON THE BORDER BETWEEN META AND </p><p>GUAVIARE DEPARTMENTS, IN SOUTHEASTERN COLOMBIA, NEAR THE </p><p>EASTERN BORDER OF THE FORMER DEMILITARIZED ZONE.  IN </p><p>MID-JULY, AND AGAIN AT THE END OF LAST WEEK, THE 44TH FRONT </p><p>OF THE FARC TOLD PUERTO ALVIRA RESIDENTS THAT PARAMILITARIES </p><p>WERE MOVING INTO THE AREA, AND THAT FIGHTING IN PUERTO ALVIRA </p><p>BETWEEN THE FARC AND PARAMILITARIES WAS IMMINENT.  THE FARC </p><p>THEN ORDERED THE INHABITANTS TO LEAVE OR BE KILLED, ACCORDING </p><p>TO A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMITTEE OF THE RED </p><p>CROSS (ICRC), WHICH IS SENDING PERSONNEL TO THE AREA TO </p><p>INVESTIGATE.  WHEN COLOMBIAN ARMY TROOPS ARRIVED ON MONDAY, </p><p>THEY DISCOVERED THAT ALL BUT FIVE FAMILIES HAD ABANDONED </p><p>PUERTO ALVIRA.  BOTH THE 39TH AND 44TH FRONTS OF THE FARC </p><p>OPERATE IN THE AREA. </p><p> </p><p>2.  MEDIA REPORTS VARY WIDELY AS TO THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE </p><p>AFFECTED, FROM A LOW OF 500 TO A HIGH OF 5,000.  THE ICRC </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE TOLD POLOFF THAT 5,000 IS DEFINITELY AN </p><p>EXAGGERATION.  BASED ON INFORMATION FROM CHURCH AND LOCAL </p><p>OFFICIALS, THE REPRESENTIVE ESTIMATES THAT ROUGHLY 2,000 </p><p>PEOPLE FLED.  THE LOCAL OFFICE OF COLOMBIA\'S HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>OMBUDSMAN AGREED, TELLING POLOFF THE NUMBER CANNOT BE HIGHER </p><p>THAN 2,500 AT MOST.  APPROXIMATELY HALF WENT TO </p><p>VILLAVICENCIO, CAPITAL OF META DEPARTMENT, WHILE ANOTHER 500 </p><p>OR SO FLED EAST TO MOCUARE, A NEIGHBORING TOWN THAT -- LIKE </p><p>PUERTO ALVIRA -- HAS NO POLICE PRESENCE.  THE WHEREABOUTS OF </p><p>THE OTHER 500 OR SO PEOPLE IS A MYSTERY.  NEWSPAPER EL TIEMPO </p><p>REPORTS THAT THE FARC KIDNAPPED AT LEAST 35 YOUTH, STATING </p><p>THE YOUTH ARE NOW GUERRILLAS.  AN INFORMED GOVERNMENT </p><p>OFFICIAL TOLD POLOFF THAT HE BELIEVES THE FARC ARE HOLDING </p><p>CAPTIVE MANY MORE PEOPLE.  AID AGENCIES ARE RUSHING TO </p><p>PROVIDE FOOD AND WARM CLOTHING TO THE DISPLACED. </p><p> </p><p>3.  PUERTO ALVIRA LIES ALONG A KEY DRUG TRANSIT ROUTE, IN A </p><p>REGION WITH A LONG HISTORY OF FARC-PARAMILITARY CONFLICT.  ON </p><p>MAY 4, 1998, PARAMILITARIES MASSACRED 19 PEOPLE IN PUERTO </p><p>ALVIRA.  SIMILARLY, NEARBY MAPIRIPAN WAS THE SITE OF AN AUC </p><p>MASSACRE IN 1997.  ALSO, IN APRIL OF THIS YEAR, THE FARC </p><p>DEMANDED THAT THE PEOPLE OF MAPIRIPAN ABANDON THE TOWN.  WITH </p><p>THE HELP OF GOVERNMENT AND CHURCH OFFICIALS, THE CITIZENS OF </p><p>MAPIRIPAN TOOK SHELTER FOR FOUR DAYS ON NEARBY RANCHES, UNTIL </p><p>ARMY TROOPS ARRIVED IN MAPIRIPAN. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PATTERSON </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
