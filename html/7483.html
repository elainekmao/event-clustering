The </p><p>U.S. was disappointed by the Turkish parliament\'s rejection </p><p>of the foreign troops decree, but was also pleased by the </p><p>Turks\' opening an air corridor to support the campaign </p><p>against Iraq, Powell said.  He noted that consultation with </p><p>Turkey would continue on regional issues, and that the U.S. </p><p>has been taking into account Ankara\'s sensitivities </p><p>regarding Northern Iraq.  Powell added that he had not yet </p><p>decided on the Congress-approved $1 billion grant for </p><p>Turkey, which was tied to Turkish troops\' not going into </p><p>Northern Iraq, and stressed that he would consult the U.S. </p><p>Treasury and international financial institutions before </p><p>releasing the money.  Papers comment that  U.S. sources\' </p><p>view that these remarks as meaning that the U.S. would </p><p>review Turkey\'s economic policy and discuss it with the IMF. </p><p>Meanwhile, papers report that PUK peshmerges, through </p><p>looting and intimidation,  are forcing Arabs in Kirkuk to </p><p>leave their homes.  KDP leader Barzani has called on Kurds </p><p>exiled during the Saddam regime to return to their homes. </p><p>The Turkomen complained about Turkish liaison reports from </p><p>the region which implied that conditions in Mosul and Kirkuk </p><p>are stable.  The Turkomen claim that peshmerges have </p><p>destroyed deed records and aimed to cleanse the region of </p><p>Turks.  The TGS announced on Tuesday that 1,166 U.S. troops </p><p>deployed in Turkey within the framework of the ONW mandate </p><p>have started to leave. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EU: Mainstream papers find it `sad\' that Turkey, after </p><p>having waited for 44 years to join the European family, will </p><p>today have to merely watch the accession of ten countries </p><p>that had no democracy or free market economy until the </p><p>1990s.  EU leaders agree that Turkey\'s EU membership will be </p><p>extremely difficult if a solution to the Cyprus problem is </p><p>not reached before 2004.  Launching the fiercest criticism </p><p>of Ankara\'s policies on the EU and Cyprus, "Radikal" carried </p><p>front-page photos of Turkish Prime Ministers since 1974, </p><p>saying (sarcastically) that they should be `proud\' of the </p><p>pain Turkey is suffering today.  All papers are pessimistic </p><p>on Cyprus, pointing out that Ankara will have to debate the </p><p>Cyprus issue with the EU once the Greek Cypriots are </p><p>admitted to the union.  The EU has approved a new Accession </p><p>Partnership Accord with requirements for Turkey: Ankara </p><p>should support efforts for a solution in Cyprus; more is </p><p>expected in the government\'s fight against torture; prison </p><p>conditions should be improved; the National Security Council </p><p>(NSC) should be put under civilian control; freedom of </p><p>expression should be expanded and restriction on the press </p><p>should be removed; the right to education and broadcast in </p><p>mother tongues, including Kurdish, should be guaranteed.  If </p><p>Turkey meets these requirements, accession negotiations with </p><p>the EU will begin in December 2004.  The Greek government </p><p>said that Greek Cypriots would not attempt to block Ankara\'s </p><p>EU accession if the Cyprus problem is resolved. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Cyprus: "Hurriyet" reports that in an effort to by-pass </p><p>Denktas, Greek Prime Minister Simitis has invited Turkish </p><p>Cypriot opposition leaders to a meeting in Southern Cyprus </p><p>to discuss the future of the island.  Three opposition </p><p>parties have accepted the invitation.  Simitis is expected </p><p>to highlight the benefits of EU accession for Cyprus, and </p><p>also offer the issuance of Greek Cypriot passport to Turks. </p><p>Denktas strongly criticized the Simitis initiative.  On the </p><p>other hand, Denktas said that Foreign Minister Gul, in order </p><p>to protest the Greek Cypriots\' accession drive, should not </p><p>have gone to Athens at all.  The AKP leadership condemned </p><p>Denktas\' statement, saying that the Turkish Cypriot leader </p><p>had `gone too far.\' </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>a) Post war scenarios </p><p>b) Cyprus and Turkish foreign policy </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Transformation and Pax Americana" </p><p>Cengiz Candar wrote in the conservative "DB-Tercuman" </p><p>(4/16): "This is the beginning of a grand transformation </p><p>process.  It is also clear that the building of a `Pax </p><p>Americana\' is in the works and the initial steps are being </p><p>taken in the Middle East.  .. As British writer William </p><p>Shawcross stated in one of his King\'s College speeches, the </p><p>US is the only power capable of preserving and developing </p><p>the liberal, democratic world.  The US is a driving force </p><p>for progress also in the Islamic world.  I know this might </p><p>be upsetting for many, including Arabs and the Europeans, </p><p>but this is the reality and it cannot be changed." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Syria is next, but." </p><p>Hasan Cemal opined in mass appeal Milliyet (4/16): "It is </p><p>for sure that the Syrian regime is the next target, but it </p><p>is also unlikely that a military operation against Syria is </p><p>imminent.  The US seems to be giving priority to diplomatic </p><p>pressure.  In fact, Washington has already started pushing </p><p>the Damascus regime to end its support for terrorist </p><p>organizations.  It remains to be seen whether the Syrian </p><p>regime is going to change voluntarily. . If Syria manages to </p><p>change by itself without the use of force, and if </p><p>Palestinian-Israel peace is achieved, these developments </p><p>might even create pressure on Iranian fundamentalists and </p><p>encourage the reformists." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"To look and to see" </p><p>Semih Idiz observes a major failure of Turkish foreign </p><p>policy in mass appeal Aksam (4/16): "Turkish foreign policy </p><p>is experiencing an utter failure at this point.  Turkey has </p><p>turned into a loser both at the UN and the EU -- not only on </p><p>the Cyprus issue, but on the Iraq issue as well.  This fact </p><p>does not mean that Turkey should start whining with a </p><p>`nobody wants me\' sentiment.  Turkey better be thinking </p><p>about the reasons for its alienation in the international </p><p>arena, and come up with a rational solution.  Yet this </p><p>approach requires vision - discerning eyes that can not only </p><p>look, but also can see.  However, current developments on </p><p>both Cyprus and Iraq clearly prove that Turkey is suffering </p><p>significantly from a lack of vision." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
