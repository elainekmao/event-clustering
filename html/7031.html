<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 002145 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/01/2013 </p><p>TAGS: MOPS, PREL, CY, GR, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: CYPRUS MIL EXERCISES: TURKS NON-COMMITTAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. NICOSIA 603 </p><p>     B. STATE 81500 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Pol-Mil Counselor Stuart Brown.  Reasons </p><p>1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary: MFA is not yet ready to confirm Embassy </p><p>Nicosia\'s reporting that Turkey will not formally conduct </p><p>May\'s Toros I military exercise.  Instead, we heard Turkey\'s </p><p>traditional policy that it will mirror whatever the Greek </p><p>Cypriots choose to do.  Post will follow up to see if we can </p><p>secure newer information in the wake of our having made the </p><p>demarche.  Turkey is thinking of "exploratory talks" with </p><p>Greece at the U/S level, and FM Gul may engage FM Papandreou </p><p>on April 9 in Belgrade.  In the meantime, Turkey is working </p><p>to influence the EU Accession Treaty\'s language and FM Gul </p><p>will travel on April 3 to Nicosia for consultations.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) On March 31, polmiloff met with acting MFA Cyprus </p><p>Department Head Barkan Oz and delivered Ref B points.  Oz </p><p>reiterated Turkey\'s existing position on military exercises: </p><p>the GOT will key what it does off "what the Greek and Greek </p><p>Cypriot side does."  Polmiloff pointed out that the USG has </p><p>heard from the Turkish Cypriots that Toros I will not be </p><p>formally held this spring (Ref A).  Oz claimed he had "no </p><p>official information on this" and indicated that the decision </p><p>lay with the Turkish General Staff.  However, he volunteered </p><p>that Turkey wants to increase the level of confidence on both </p><p>sides of Cyprus and enable a continuation of talks in some </p><p>form.  He said that Turkey would attempt to engage Greece in </p><p>"exploratory talks" at the MFA U/S level on how the two </p><p>Cypriot sides might be brought together.  Oz also said FM Gul </p><p>and FM Papandreou might discuss Cyprus on April 9 in Belgrade </p><p>at the South-East Europe Cooperation Process Summit. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Oz said that "Denktash didn\'t play his cards well in </p><p>The Hague."  He thought that the Turks "would have been in a </p><p>much better position" if Denktash had agreed to hold a </p><p>referendum.  The MFA\'s perspective is that President </p><p>Papadopoulos would never have agreed to a vote before the </p><p>signing of the accession partnership document on April 16, </p><p>thus leaving the Turkish Cypriots looking like the </p><p>cooperative party.  Instead, Oz said that the GOT was now </p><p>engaged in a lobbying campaign in Brussels with the EU </p><p>Commission and in Ankara with member-state ambassadors. </p><p>Though he seemed pessimistic, he described Turkey\'s strategy </p><p>as aimed at securing changes to the EU Accession Treaty. </p><p>According to Oz, the treaty\'s current text "will close the </p><p>door" on a solution.  If the EU were to "to leave the door </p><p>open," The parties would have until May 2004 to keep talking. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Polmiloff asked Oz to find out whether the GOT could </p><p>give us a better indication on Toros I.  Post will follow up </p><p>with the MFA Cyprus Department and report if we receive new </p><p>information.  FM Gul is due in Nicosia on April 3 for </p><p>consultations.  MFA may choose to delay confirming Ref A </p><p>until after the visit.  In responding to questions regarding </p><p>the trip, MFA\'s spokesman said, "It has been announced on </p><p>various occasions that a non-solution is not a solution.  The </p><p>failure of the Annan plan does not mean that efforts have </p><p>been stopped.  Turkey is conducting its own work." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
