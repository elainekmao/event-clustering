<p>UNCLAS AMMAN 001252 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>USDOC FOR 4520/ITA/MAC/ONE/COBERG </p><p>USDOC ALSO FOR ADVOCACY CENTER </p><p>USUN FOR KONZET, HILLMAN </p><p>STATE ALSO FOR L/NEA AND L/EB </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: BEXP, EPET, ETTC, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: BIDDER ON JORDAN-IRAQ OIL PIPELINE SEEKS USG </p><p>SUPPORT </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED; PLEASE PROTECT ACCORDINGLY </p><p> </p><p>This is an action request:  see para 3. </p><p> </p><p>1.  (sbu)  We were recently contacted by Brock Tuppeny, </p><p>Business Development Manager for Petrofac, a UK-registered </p><p>company with extensive operations in Texas and partial U.S. </p><p>ownership.  According to Tuppeny, Petrofac is involved in, </p><p>inter alia, construction of the Georgian portion of the </p><p>Baku-Ceyhan oil pipeline.  Tuppeny approached us seeking USG </p><p>advocacy for their bid on the tender to build an oil pipeline </p><p>and related support facilities linking Jordan\'s Zarqa </p><p>refinery to the Iraqi border. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (sbu)  In the first instance, we have referred Tuppeny to </p><p>the DoC website to complete an advocacy request.  In the </p><p>interim, we have reviewed the RFP and Petrofac\'s proposal to </p><p>get a basic understanding of the project.  However, upon </p><p>review of the RFP, we learned that the tender includes </p><p>significant construction on the Iraqi side of the Jordan-Iraq </p><p>border.  Specifically, the RFP requests the project developer </p><p>to: </p><p> </p><p>"...finance, design, build and transfer to the Government of </p><p>Iraq before start of commercial operation of the system a </p><p>truck unloading facility, a tank farm, a booster pump station </p><p>and a custody transfer metering facility located directly at </p><p>the Iraq Jordan border on Iraqi territory (these facilities </p><p>will be owned, operated and maintained by the Iraqi </p><p>government)..." </p><p> </p><p>3.  (sbu)  Action request:  We believe there is a distinct </p><p>possibility that such a project as currently composed could </p><p>run afoul of U.N. and U.S. sanctions on Iraq.  Thus before </p><p>proceeding with any advocacy on Petrofac\'s behalf, we would </p><p>appreciate Washington guidance on our ability to speak on </p><p>behalf of this company. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
