(U) This is the weekly reporting cable for July 21-25, </p><p>2003. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) RFGs contained in paragraphs 17 & 24. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>Informal Consultations of the EC on </p><p>Plan of Action Preparations </p><p>Article VII and Universality </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) On July 24, Ambassador Petr Kubernat, EC Chairman, </p><p>presided over the Informal Open-ended Consultations on the </p><p>preparation of the plans of action on National Implementation </p><p>and Universality.  Amb. Kubernat stated that the objectives </p><p>of the meeting were to clarify how the Executive Council (EC) </p><p>would proceed on the two plans of action.  The group would </p><p>not be taking a decision on either issue at this point. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) Amb Kubernat reminded the group that the Review </p><p>Conference had decided that a plan of action for both Article </p><p>VII and Universality were needed.  EC-34 was required to </p><p>provide recommendations on the Article VII plan of action to </p><p>CSP-8 in October while the Universality plan of action did </p><p>not have a timeframe associated to it.  Amb. Kubernat stated </p><p>that his goal for the Universality plan of action was to have </p><p>it developed by EC-35 in December. </p><p> </p><p>--Universality Plan of Action-- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) The meeting began with a brief discussion of </p><p>Universality.  Amb. Kubernat announced that Consuelo Femenia, </p><p>Spain, would be the new facilitator for the Universality plan </p><p>of action.  Ms. Femenia was not present at the meeting, </p><p>however, Amb. Kubernat informed the group that Ms. Femenia\'s </p><p>plans were to work bilaterally with States Parties in August </p><p>to get their views on Universality, prior to setting a date </p><p>for an initial meeting. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) Yu Huang, Director, External Relations, presented an </p><p>informal TS paper on Universality, (Draft Elements of an </p><p>Action Plan on Universal Adherence to the CWC -- faxed to </p><p>AC/CB).  Since this was the first opportunity for States </p><p>Parties to see this paper, there was no discussion of the </p><p>text.  However, the Mexican delegation pointed out that the </p><p>TS paper did not include any references to the work of the </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>International Cooperation and Assistance (ICA) Division.  She </p><p>asked whether the TS would put out another paper to include </p><p>ICA\'s contribution.  In reply, DDG Hawtin announced his </p><p>intention to spearhead a task force approach to coordinating </p><p>issues on Article VII and Universality.  He emphasized the </p><p>need to enforce coordination among the TS divisions and that </p><p>he would personally lead this effort.  (NOTE:  Ralf Trapp </p><p>assured Del on the margins that ICA Division had coordinated </p><p>on Huang\'s paper, but the fact remains that no ICA activity </p><p>was incorporated into the draft.) </p><p> </p><p>--Article VII Plan of Action-- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) Amb. Kubernat announced that Mark Matthews, UK, would </p><p>be the facilitator for the Article VII plan of action.  He </p><p>informed the group that there were currently two papers </p><p>tabled for consideration, a U.S. national paper and an </p><p>informal TS paper. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) The U.S. del presented the U.S. national paper to the </p><p>group.  Del stressed the importance of maintaining the </p><p>momentum from the Review Conference by developing a plan of </p><p>action for EC-34 to recommend to CSP-8.  Del emphasized that </p><p>it was essential to establish a clear timeframe for meeting </p><p>Article VII obligations and proposed CSP-10 as the timeframe </p><p>for compliance.  Del also noted that if there were States </p><p>Parties who were unwilling to meet their Article VII </p><p>obligations by CSP-10, the Conference would have the action </p><p>to remedy the situation, in accordance with Article XII. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) Del noted the focus of the national implementation </p><p>should primarily be on 1) criminalizing CW activities, and 2) </p><p>the authority to compel industry declarations to the national </p><p>government.  The plan should emphasize States Parties\' </p><p>responsibility to come into compliance. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U) Amb. Kubernat announced that Mr. Trapp, TS Office of </p><p>the DDG, had been selected as the TS representative to </p><p>coordinate the TS efforts on Article VII issues.  Mr. Trapp </p><p>presented an informal TS paper (Possible Approach to </p><p>developing an OPCW Action Plan on National Implementation of </p><p>the CWC - faxed to AC/CB).  Mr. Trapp stated that the TS </p><p>paper was basically a "think piece" on the issue of Article </p><p>VII obligations. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U) The Netherlands asked what the budget implications </p><p>were for implementing the actions associated with these </p><p>plans.  DDG Hawtin stated that there were currently no </p><p>resource issues.  He believed that there would not be a need </p><p>to insert a line item in the 2004 budget.  However, if 2005 </p><p>was established as the deadline for compliance, the TS might </p><p>have to request additional funding to meet this demand. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (U) As the facilitator, Mr. Matthews stressed that there </p><p>was much work to be done to develop a plan of action by </p><p>EC-34. He stated that his plan for the facilitation was to </p><p>begin bilateral consultations with States Parties now and to </p><p>hold a first open-ended consultation at the end of August (29 </p><p>August).  By a second meeting in early September he would </p><p>present a facilitator\'s paper for discussion.  He stated that </p><p>he would be in The Hague through the month of August.  There </p><p>were several dels that noted the difficulties in meeting </p><p>during August, since this is the summer holiday time.  Mr. </p><p>Matthews stated that he would attempt to work out a solution. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>Meeting with the DDG and </p><p>Article VII Facilitator </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  (U) Del met in the afternoon of July 24 with DDG Hawtin, </p><p>Ralf Trapp, Sarah Foulds, and Mark Matthews to directly </p><p>discuss the U.S. national paper and to get feedback on the </p><p>paper from the TS and the facilitator.  The U.S. del reviewed </p><p>the key elements of the paper with the group and asked for </p><p>comments. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (SBU) The DDG opined that this was the first time that </p><p>the OPCW had been tasked to write a plan of action.  He </p><p>stressed his concern that the vision of what a plan of action </p><p>would look like means different things to different States </p><p>Parties.  He strongly emphasized that the mention of Article </p><p>XII in a plan of action would "scare the horses."  He is very </p><p>concerned that, if the U.S. presses this point too hard, it </p><p>would be detrimental to the plan itself. </p><p> </p><p>15.  (SBU) The DDG also asked if the U.S. believed that all </p><p>153 States Parties would be fully compliant with Article VII </p><p>in 2 years time.  He noted the difficulty some States Parties </p><p>would have in meeting this timeframe.  He said that he did </p><p>not oppose the two-year proposal.  However, he asked if a </p><p>State Party was acting in good faith to meet its obligations, </p><p>but had missed the timeline, would the U.S. consider it as </p><p>non-compliant as a State Party who had done nothing in two </p><p>years?  Del responded that the onus would be on the States </p><p>Parties to explain why a two-year timeframe was unachievable. </p><p> </p><p>16.  (SBU) The DDG stated that it would be a big task not </p><p>only for States Parties, but also for the TS to get States </p><p>Parties to meet these obligations in two years.  He asked </p><p>whether the U.S. would consider the idea of States Parties </p><p>providing consultants, cost-free experts, or organizing </p><p>events to assist the TS in this effort. </p><p> </p><p>17.  (SBU) RFG:  What is Washington\'s position regarding the </p><p>idea of States Parties providing consultants or cost-free </p><p>experts to assist the TS in Article VII activities? </p><p> </p><p>18.  (S) The DDG privately reflected, (Please Protect), his </p><p>concern that a 2005 timeframe for compliance would be </p><p>demanding.  He reminded the Del that the Results Based </p><p>Budgeting was to be implemented by the TS in 2005.  This </p><p>would require a lot of work between now and 2005 and that it </p><p>would require the TS to work with the non-WEOG States Parties </p><p>to change the culture of how the budget will be implemented. </p><p>He asked that we keep both issues in perspective as we </p><p>develop the Article VII plan of action.  He feared that we </p><p>were moving too far too fast.  He wondered whether we would </p><p>consider moving the Article VII plan of action timeline to </p><p>2006. </p><p>19.  (S) Mr. Trapp opined that the plan of action approved by </p><p>the EC and, ultimately by the CSP, would need to be a top </p><p>level document that clearly lays out the mechanisms and </p><p>targets.  However, he envisioned that in order to implement </p><p>the approved plan a more detailed version would be developed </p><p>by the TS to operationalize the overall plan of action. </p><p> </p><p>20.  (SBU) Mr. Trapp mentioned that the TS had received a </p><p>proposal from Barry Kellman on ways to help States Parties </p><p>develop implementing legislation.  The TS has not yet made a </p><p>decision on this proposal. </p><p> </p><p>21.  (SBU) Mr. Matthews stated that he would be using the </p><p>U.S. national paper as the basis from which the facilitator\'s </p><p>paper on the Article VII action plan would be drafted.  The </p><p>del will be meeting with Mr. Matthews during the week of July </p><p>28 to discuss the paper in more detail. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>Meeting with the TS Legal Officers </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>22.  (U) On Friday, July 25, Del met with TS representatives </p><p>from the Legal Advisors office to review the status of States </p><p>Parties response to Article VI and VII questionnaires.  The </p><p>U.S. del briefed the TS on the status of the U.S. demarches </p><p>to States Parties who had not responded to the questionnaires </p><p>nor had established a national authority. </p><p> </p><p>23.  (U) The TS informed the Del that it had sent a Note </p><p>Verbal to States Parties requesting a status of their </p><p>national implementation measures.  The TS plans to provide an </p><p>updated report to CSP-8 on national implementation measures. </p><p>Also, the TS stated that they were creating legal models for </p><p>each type of legal system in the various regions.  The TS </p><p>will be looking for States Parties to comment on these </p><p>models, once they are completed.  The TS asked whether the </p><p>U.S. nominees to the Legal Network meeting, scheduled for </p><p>November, would be willing to review and comment on these </p><p>models.  Del stated that they would inquire on the </p><p>availability of the nominees to take on this task. </p><p> </p><p>24.  (U) RFG:  Would one or both of the U.S. nominees be </p><p>available to provide review and comment to the TS legal </p><p>models being developed?  It is not anticipated that travel </p><p>would be required. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>Comments from Japan </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>25.  (SBU) The Del met with Chiho Komuro, Japanese </p><p>delegation, to receive comments from Japan on the U.S. </p><p>national paper for Article VII.  Japan shares the views of </p><p>the U.S. that a plan of action must be developed immediately. </p><p> However, Japan emphasized that it was essential that the </p><p>U.S. get the developing States Parties on board with this </p><p>plan.  Japan is very concerned that the tone of the paper was </p><p>too strong in some places and that it would turn the </p><p>developing States Parties against the U.S. plan.  For </p><p>example, Japan does not support the reference to Article XII. </p><p> They believe that it will make it impossible to gain </p><p>consensus on a plan of action.  It will place the developing </p><p>States Parties in a defensive position and such political </p><p>pressure would not be productive. </p><p> </p><p>26.  (SBU) Japan said that it would support the two-year </p><p>timeframe, however, it believed that the U.S. was too </p><p>optimistic in believing that all States Parties could meet </p><p>this goal by CSP-10. </p><p> </p><p>27.  (SBU) Japan emphasized that the U.S. outreach may not be </p><p>applicable in all regions, namely in Asia and with the Middle </p><p>Eastern States Parties.  Also, the emphasis on regional </p><p>groups needing to identify a lead State Party to foster other </p><p>States Parties would not be agreeable to the Asian Group. </p><p>This concept would only heighten already tense discussions </p><p>within the Asian Group. </p><p>28.  (C)  Japan noted, in confidence, that the Asian Group </p><p>will meet 20 August to try to reach consensus on a delegation </p><p>to coordinate the group for the next year.  China and Japan </p><p>are the two candidates.  The Asian Group must also nominate </p><p>the next Chairman of the CSP, to take office in October. </p><p>Naturally, the possibility of China taking one job and Japan </p><p>the other has occurred to delegations as a possible </p><p>compromise solution. </p><p> </p><p>29.  (SBU) Japan asked the U.S. to poll the developing States </p><p>Parties about their reaction to the paper.  Japan would like </p><p>to be kept informed of the responses to the paper received by </p><p>the U.S. </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>Other Business </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>30.  (U) The DDG informed the Del that Eva Murray, Canada, </p><p>was selected as the newly hired Head, Human Resources Branch. </p><p> </p><p>31.  (U)  Kellogg sends. </p><p>RUSSEL </p><p></p></div>
