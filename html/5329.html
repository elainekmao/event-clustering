SUMMARY:  THE PUBLIC AFFAIRS OFFICE IN ABU DHABI </p><p>RECENTLY PARTICIPATED IN THE SHARJAH INTERNATIONAL BOOK </p><p>FAIR, ONE OF POST\'S MAJOR ANNUAL CULTURAL ACTIVITIES. </p><p>PAO DISPLAYED AND SOLD MORE THAN 300 TITLES TO PRIVATE </p><p>INDIVIDUALS, OFFICIALS, AND REPRESENTATIVES FROM A WIDE </p><p>RANGE OF EDUCATIONAL AND CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS.  OUR </p><p>PARTICIPATION REAFFIRMED THE USEFULNESS OF RBO ARABIC </p><p>BOOKS AS AN EFFECTIVE OUTREACH TOOL AND EXEMPLIFIED OUR </p><p>LONG-TERM CULTURAL AND EDUCATIONAL COMMITMENT TO THE </p><p>UAE. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  THE PUBLIC AFFAIRS OFFICE IN ABU DHABI PARTICIPATED </p><p>IN THE TWENTY-FIRST SHARJAH INTERNATIONAL BOOK FAIR, </p><p>FROM DECEMBER 30, 2002, TO JANUARY 9, 2003.  THE SHARJAH </p><p>BOOK FAIR REPRESENTS A MAJOR REGIONAL CULTURAL EVENT </p><p>THAT IS WIDELY ATTENDED BY SCHOLARS, ACADEMICS, AND </p><p>PUBLISHERS FROM THE UAE, GCC, AND OTHER MIDDLE EASTERN </p><p>COUNTRIES.  THE U.S. EMBASSY BOOTH EXHIBITED MORE THAN </p><p>300 TITLES OF RBO BOOKS, ENGLISH TEACHING MATERIALS, AND </p><p>IIP MATERIALS.  THE RULER OF SHARJAH, DR. SHEIKH SULTAN </p><p>BIN MUHAMMAD AL-QASSIMI, OFFICIALLY OPENED THE FAIR AND </p><p>SPENT TIME AT THE U.S. BOOTH DISCUSSING U.S. POLITICS </p><p>AND POST\'S MATERIALS WITH AMBASSADOR MARCELLE WAHBA, PAO </p><p>KATHERINE VAN DE VATE, AND OTHER EMBASSY STAFF.  MAJOR </p><p>PURCHASERS INCLUDED THE SHARJAH CULTURAL DEPARTMENT, A </p><p>VARIETY OF PRIVATE SCHOOLS, PUBLIC LIBRARIES, AND </p><p>SHARJAH UNIVERSITY.  HOWEVER, MORE THAN 150,000 PEOPLE, </p><p>40,000 OF THEM STUDENTS, ATTENDED THE BOOK FAIR. </p><p> </p><p>3.  THIS PROGRAM BUILDS ON POST\'S LONG-TERM COMMITMENT </p><p>TO CULTURAL AND EDUCATIONAL RELATIONS BETWEEN THE U.S. </p><p>AND THE UAE.  WHILE OVERSHADOWED BY THE INCREASED </p><p>MOBILIZATION OF U.S. MILITARY AGAINST IRAQ, POST\'S </p><p>PARTICIPATION FOSTERED MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING BY GIVING </p><p>VISITORS AN OPPORTUNITY TO ACQUIRE CURRENT TITLES ON </p><p>U.S. CULTURE, POLITICS, AND GOVERNMENT IN ARABIC.  THIS </p><p>PROGRAM FURTHER SUPPORTED MPP THEMES "DEMOCRACY AND U.S. </p><p>SOCIETY" AND "MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING."  PARTICIPATION IN </p><p>THE SHARJAH BOOK FAIR ALSO ALLOWED US TO PRESENT U.S. </p><p>CULTURE AND VALUES TO A WIDE RANGE OF INTELLECTUALS, </p><p>MEMBERS OF THE MEDIA, AND STUDENTS, INCLUDING BOTH UAE </p><p>NATIONALS AND EXPATRIATE ARABS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  RESULT/IMPACT:  EXCELLENT.  IN SPITE OF THE INTENSE </p><p>POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT ASSOCIATED WITH THE CURRENT </p><p>MOBILIZATION OF U.S. TROOPS IN THE REGION, POST </p><p>SUCCEEDED IN OBTAINING MAXIMUM EXPOSURE FOR IIP </p><p>MATERIALS AND TRANSLATED AMERICAN PUBLICATIONS, SELLING </p><p>MORE THAN 500 BOOKS.  THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE VISITED THE </p><p>BOOTH, INCLUDING SENIOR GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, SHEIKHS, </p><p>INTELLECTUALS, AND FACULTY MEMBERS FROM SEVERAL </p><p>UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES.  DUBAI TV CARRIED A 5-MINUTE </p><p>INTERVIEW WITH AMBASSADOR MARCELLE WAHBA WHO COMMENTED </p><p>ON THE IMPORTANCE OF POST\'S PARTICIPATION AND THE RBO </p><p>PROGRAM.  DURING THE INTERVIEW, AMBASSADOR WAHBA </p><p>HIGHLIGHTED A RANGE OF IMPORTANT BOOKS, INCLUDING MANY </p><p>NEW TITLES. </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
