<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 RANGOON 000696 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p>USPACOM FOR FPA </p><p>USMISSION NEW YORK FOR AMBASSADOR TWINING </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/04/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, BM, Human Rights </p><p>SUBJECT: COM PRESSES HOME MINISTER TO RELEASE DETAINEES AND </p><p>MOVE FORWARD ON RECONCILIATION </p><p> </p><p>REF: RANGOON 665 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: COM CARMEN M. MARTINEZ FOR REASON 1.5(D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C)  Summary:  On June 11, COM had a frank meeting with </p><p>Minister of Home Affairs Colonel Tin Hlaing to discuss the </p><p>recent crackdown on the NLD and to deliver an  advance copy </p><p>of this year\'s Trafficking In Persons report.  On recent NLD </p><p>detentions, Tin Hlaing denied press reports that the </p><p>government told Special Envoy Razali that Aung San Suu Kyi </p><p>would be released in immediately or in two weeks, saying </p><p>there was no timetable for her release.  He assured the COM, </p><p>however, that the International Committee of the Red Cross </p><p>would have access to recent detainees once a police </p><p>investigation of the incident on May 30 is completed </p><p>(although this contradicts what ICRC has been told, see </p><p>septel).  The Minister provided a detailed account of SPDC </p><p>internal security concerns prior to May 30, and a description </p><p>of what occurred the night of the clash.  The COM said that </p><p>allowing Embassy officers to visit the site of the clash was </p><p>a positive approach.  COM then described some of the </p><p>information Emboffs collected which indicated a premeditated </p><p>attack by trained individuals (some disguised as monks) and </p><p>did not support the government\'s version of events.  She </p><p>stressed the extreme importance the USG placed on a credible </p><p>investigation of the attack and full accounting for the </p><p>people who have been missing or were detained since then. </p><p>She reiterated that the U.S. saw no justification for the </p><p>continued detention of ASSK and other NLD members and called </p><p>for their immediate release.  She urged the Minister to take </p><p>actions to undo the harsh measures taken over the past 12 </p><p>days and to use his influence to get the national </p><p>reconciliation process back on track.  She also provided the </p><p>Minister a copy of the Trafficking in Persons report, noting </p><p>that the government\'s failure to make progress on forced </p><p>labor was the primary reason Burma was still on Tier 3.  The </p><p>Minister said his government "takes U.S. views very much to </p><p>heart," and asked the COM to keep in close communication with </p><p>him.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>NLD Crackdown </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  In a June 11 meeting with Home Minister Tin Hlaing </p><p>(accompanied by the Deputy Home Minister and an interpreter) </p><p>the COM asked for clarification of news reports that Special </p><p>Envoy Razali had said Aung San Suu Kyi (ASSK) might be </p><p>released immediately or within two weeks.  The Minister said </p><p>there must have been some mistake because there was no </p><p>timetable set for her release.  He said that her protective </p><p>custody is a temporary situation but there has been no </p><p>decision when she might be released.  The Minister said a </p><p>formal police investigation of the incident that occurred on </p><p>May 30 is underway, intimating that the results of the </p><p>investigation will have a bearing on ASSK\'s release. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  The COM expressed the USG\'s concern regarding those </p><p>missing after the May 30 clash and urged the Minister to </p><p>provide an accurate account of what transpired that night and </p><p>to account for those that are missing, injured, or dead.  She </p><p>asked if any charges had been fixed against those jailed </p><p>after the attack and why 19 of the NLD leaders from the </p><p>convoy were reportedly in protective custody and still </p><p>incommunicado.  The Minister said no charges had been made </p><p>against anyone yet, that 25 of the people detained that night </p><p>were released yesterday, and that others were being held as </p><p>part of the investigation.  He said the 19 NLD leaders were </p><p>still in protective custody because, "The situation is </p><p>confusing, not stable, and not to our liking.  We want the </p><p>dust to settle, then diplomats will be able to visit these </p><p>individuals." </p><p> </p><p>The SPDC\'s Version of Events </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  He elaborated that the SPDC had evidence and </p><p>intelligence that the incident was pre-planned (he did not </p><p>elaborate by whom).  He shared the following information, </p><p>which he deemed "very confidential," regarding events leading </p><p>up to the incident: </p><p> </p><p>-- Earlier this year, ASSK and Senior General Than Shwe had </p><p>dinner together and agreed on steps to national </p><p>reconciliation and democratic reform.  Part of the agreement </p><p>was that ASSK could rally her supporters in NLD offices but </p><p>not elsewhere, and she could travel to any part of the </p><p>country.  (Note:  This is the first official confirmation of </p><p>this meeting.  ASSK has always avoided any direct discussion </p><p>or even acknowledgment of meetings with Than Shwe or Khin </p><p>Nyunt when we have met with her.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>-- Up until January or February, everything went according to </p><p>plan and there was no tension.  Then, the SPDC received </p><p>information that the NLD was planning a political change in </p><p>June and ASSK started to break the rules established for her </p><p>travels (see reftel, para. 3; this parallels what S-1 said to </p><p>Razali.)  She began to hold roadside meetings and speak to </p><p>crowds gathered to see her at monasteries.  She started </p><p>traveling without keeping military intelligence advised of </p><p>her plans, sometimes traveling through the night.  This </p><p>caused problems for them because they could not provide her </p><p>adequate security.  Military intelligence warned her </p><p>repeatedly to keep them advised of her travel plans, but she </p><p>did not. </p><p> </p><p>-- In Kachin State, the SPDC found that a lot of people did </p><p>not like ASSK and this became a big concern for the </p><p>government.  ASSK continued to cause problems which </p><p>aggravated the people such as not paying tolls at bridge </p><p>crossings, causing traffic jams with her motorcade, and using </p><p>monks as a means of taking advantage of uneducated poor </p><p>people. </p><p> </p><p>-- At the same time, insurgent groups along the Thai border </p><p>began rallying support for ASSK, producing pamphlets, and </p><p>planting explosive devices.  These activities seemed to be </p><p>"in synch" with her activities. </p><p> </p><p>-- Secretary One Khin Nyunt had planned to meet with ASSK in </p><p>May but at the last minute she said she would be traveling, </p><p>and she designated NLD Secretary U Lwin to meet with </p><p>Secretary One. </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  Note: It is very unlikely that these "confidential" </p><p>tidbits are original thoughts from the Minister; they are </p><p>most likely the party line on why ASSK\'s activities could not </p><p>be allowed to continue (the points about people not liking </p><p>her because she did not pay bridge tolls, disrupted traffic, </p><p>etc., have been leveled before and are becoming tiresome). </p><p>The failure to coordinate her travel with authorities, fears </p><p>of links to subversive groups, and the affront to Khin Nyunt </p><p>for proposing a substitute to represent her at a requested </p><p>meeting with him, combined with concerns about her growing </p><p>popularity and independence, sound closer to the mark as to </p><p>why the SPDC was unhappy.  End Note. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C)  The Minister then segued into the events of May 30, </p><p>saying that it was very confusing because it was dark that </p><p>night but, so far, the following information was available. </p><p>ASSK was supposed stay in Mon Ywa that night but instead </p><p>chose to travel toward Depeyin.  At a certain place in the </p><p>road, there were 2,000 (down from the governments previous </p><p>claim of 5,000) people "who were against her" who had blocked </p><p>the road.  Her motorcycle escort turned back when it saw </p><p>these people but her car (with lights switched off) forced </p><p>its way straight through the crowd, fortunately not injuring </p><p>anyone.  The second car, carrying NLD Vice Chairman U Tin Oo, </p><p>also attempted to force its way through the crowd but it hit </p><p>some people and came to an abrupt halt.  A trailing </p><p>motorcycle ran into it and crashed.  The third car ran over </p><p>the motorcyclist, killing him, and the whole convoy came to a </p><p>halt.  Violence then broke out until security police reached </p><p>the scene, restored order, and took the injured to the </p><p>hospital.  U Tin Oo got out of his car and walked to Depeyin </p><p>where he was put in protective custody; he was uninjured. </p><p>After ASSK made it through the crowd, she also met the police </p><p>and was taken into protective custody. </p><p> </p><p>U.S. Concerns </p><p>7. (C)  The COM said the information was appreciated and that </p><p>the lack of interference with the Embassy officers who </p><p>visited the site of the clash on June 4-5 was a positive </p><p>step.  She said that the information the Emboffs gathered </p><p>from many people in the area, and the items they found at the </p><p>scene, did not support the Minister\'s account of the </p><p>incident.  She provided a synopsis of the attack as related </p><p>to Emboffs by many sources, which indicated that the convoy </p><p>was blocked by trucks and attacked by an organized and </p><p>trained group of armed individuals who wore white armbands to </p><p>identify themselves.  She said the idea that 2,000 local </p><p>people would congregate in a field at night to attack ASSK </p><p>was not a credible story and she hoped the government </p><p>investigation would provide a more credible account.  The COM </p><p>also reiterated the USG\'s deep concern for the people missing </p><p>and possibly injured or dead as a result of the attack.  She </p><p>urged the Minister to ensure a full accounting, including </p><p>names of the dead, as soon as possible. </p><p> </p><p>ICRC Access </p><p> </p><p>8. (C)  The COM noted that the ICRC has a standing agreement </p><p>with the government to be notified of new political arrests </p><p>and to have access to these detainees as quickly as possible, </p><p>and asked if ICRC had been given access to those detained on </p><p>May 30 or to other NLD members detained since that night. </p><p>The Minister responded that the ICRC did not have access to </p><p>these detainees yet but that it would be granted access as </p><p>soon as possible.  He said that normally ICRC is not granted </p><p>access to detainees while an investigation is underway.  The </p><p>COM emphasized the importance of granting ICRC access to </p><p>these detainees as quickly as possible.  The Minister </p><p>responded that he was the focal point for the ICRC, he knew </p><p>the importance of their work, and he would make sure they got </p><p>access.  (Note:  According to the head of ICRC in Rangoon, </p><p>Secretary One Khin Nyunt told him on June 10 that ICRC would </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>not get access to detainees taken in at the May 30 incident </p><p>or since.  The Home Minister was present at that meeting but </p><p>perhaps he still hopes to gain access for ICRC.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>National Reconciliation Is Top Priority </p><p> </p><p>9. (C)  The COM said that the USG and the world is watching </p><p>and the SPDC needs to not only restore the political climate </p><p>that existed prior to the May 30 clash, but go beyond that in </p><p>order to demonstrate that it is still committed to national </p><p>reconciliation.  She urged the Minister to do everything he </p><p>could to quickly move the process forward and reminded him </p><p>that he once told her "I do not like to keep Burmese people </p><p>in jail".  (Note:  While we do not have any illusions that </p><p>the Minister has the authority to act alone on this, he is </p><p>one of the more approachable Ministers and he has good access </p><p>to Secretary One.  Certainly the COM\'s comments will be </p><p>reported to at least that level, and hopefully higher.  End </p><p>Note.) </p><p> </p><p>Trafficking in Persons </p><p> </p><p>10. (C)  The COM provided the Minister with a copy of this </p><p>year\'s Trafficking In Persons report and Poloff provided an </p><p>overview of the Burma section of the report.  TIP falls under </p><p>the Minister\'s purview and Poloff was able to report on </p><p>several areas in which the Ministry and its partners had made </p><p>progress on TIP during the year.  Poloff noted, however, that </p><p>Burma remained a Tier 3 country on the TIP ranking in large </p><p>part due to its failure to make adequate progress on forced </p><p>labor, which is included in the U.S. definition of TIP.  The </p><p>Minister appeared to appreciate receiving the report and </p><p>feedback on his Ministry\'s actions (he does not have </p><p>authority on forced issues). </p><p> </p><p>11. (C)  Comment:  Despite the frank and candid nature of the </p><p>COM\'s message in this one-hour meeting, the Minister was very </p><p>cordial and stated in his closing remarks that he "takes U.S. </p><p>views very much to heart," and asked that the Embassy </p><p>continue to provide him with news releases and information on </p><p>this matter and other issues as it becomes available.  As </p><p>with a handful of other Ministers, we have the impression </p><p>that the Home Minister recognizes the serious problems in his </p><p>government.  End Comment. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
