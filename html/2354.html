<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 000014 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/02/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINS, SOCI, CASC, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: COMMUNAL VIOLENCE IN PLATEAU STATE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: 01 ABUJA 2255 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by CDA Andrews for reason 1.5 (d.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U)  Summary: December 30-31 communal violence in Plateau </p><p>State has resulted in numerous deaths and scattered property </p><p>damage.  Death estimates range between 33 and 90 people.  The </p><p>proximate cause of the encounters was the perennial </p><p>competition over land between cattle herders (mostly </p><p>Hausa/Fulani) and farmers (ethnic Biroms.)  The fighting </p><p>occurred near Vom, approximately 10 miles south of the state </p><p>capital, Jos, and did not approach Jos.  The military has </p><p>been deployed and the Vom area is quiet.  Consular wardens </p><p>report that Jos is also calm and that no Amcits were caught </p><p>in the melee.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U)  According to a statement issued by the Plateau State </p><p>Government and carried by the local press, the violence </p><p>erupted when forty armed men attacked the home of the </p><p>district head of Vwang district in the Jos South Local </p><p>Government Area during the early morning hours of December </p><p>30.  Eighteen people reportedly were killed, including eight </p><p>attackers who were shot after being pursued by a joint </p><p>army-police security task force.  (Comment: Press reports </p><p>referred to the culprits as "foreign bandits."  That these </p><p>raiders were non-Nigerians who crossed an international </p><p>border to carry out this attack seems unlikely.  More </p><p>plausible is that the press picked up on the local usage of </p><p>"foreign," which would imply the attackers were Hausa/Fulani </p><p>or some other ethnic group not considered "indigenous" to the </p><p>area.  The other major ethnic groups in the Jos vicinity </p><p>pejoratively consider Hausa/Fulani as alien to the area </p><p>although they have resided there since the 19th century and </p><p>were the cardinal force behind the founding of Jos in the </p><p>early 1900\'s.  End comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU)  That the Birom attributed the December 30 attack to </p><p>the Hausa/Fulani soon became evident.  Later in the day, </p><p>reprisal attacks were carried out against Hausa/Fulani </p><p>resident in the Vwang district.  Some of these attacks may </p><p>have continued until December 31. Death estimates from the </p><p>reprisals range from 15 to 70.  (The higher figure comes from </p><p>Dutch expatriates working in the vicinity.) The news of the </p><p>original attacks and the reprisals spread quickly, causing </p><p>many Plateau State inhabitants to fear a replay of the early </p><p>September violence that claimed over 2,000 lives in Jos. </p><p>Several hundreds, mostly of Hausa/Fulani apparently sought </p><p>refuge from the feared escalation at the 3rd armored Division </p><p>barracks in Rukuba.  Also many merchants in Jos hurriedly </p><p>closed shop or refused to open on hearing of the clashes, </p><p>according to Colonel Mohammed Inra Idris, Special Assistant </p><p>to National Security Advisor Aliyu Mohammed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU)  Idris discounted any direct connection between the </p><p>December 30-31 flare ups and the earlier September violence. </p><p>Instead, this latter episode seemed very localized, confined </p><p>to the district around Vom.  Professor John Elaigwu at the </p><p>Institute of Governance and Social Responsibility at the </p><p>University of Jos also concurred with this assessment. </p><p>Elaigwu, who served as Director General of the </p><p>Inter-governmental Institute on Conflict Resolution during </p><p>the Abacha years, stated that the violence was the product of </p><p>perennial dispute over land usage between cattle herders and </p><p>farmers.  Particularly during the dry season, fertile land is </p><p>at a premium.  Competition between those who seek the land </p><p>for grazing and those who want it for cultivation is </p><p>heightened. In this case, the pressure gradually built until </p><p>reaching a point where it had to be vented.  Religion crept </p><p>into the equation as at most a secondary consideration. </p><p>Herders tend to be Hausa/Fulani Muslims while the farmers are </p><p>ethnic Birom and Anguta, who are mainly Christian. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>Return To Calm, For Now </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (U)  Security forces and the Plateau State Government seem </p><p>to have reacted swiftly to contain the violence. </p><p>Approximately 150 soldiers and policemen have been deployed </p><p>to the troubled area.  The State Government has also </p><p>tightened the midnight curfew established after the September </p><p>eruption. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (U)  Amcit wardens report the American Community is well </p><p>but note concerns among their Nigerian acquaintances that </p><p>further violence could erupt if forces relax their vigilance </p><p>or reduce their presence </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C)  Comment: the temptation to draw a causal link between </p><p>the September Jos violence and what just happened in Vom is </p><p>understandable.  While a few observers have attempted this </p><p>nexus, the weight of evidence suggests no direct connection </p><p>between the two episodes.  The December 30-31 violence </p><p>appears the result of chronic land use competition that </p><p>unfortunately went from bad to worse for many of the area\'s </p><p>inhabitants.  Yet, given the high anxiety and residual </p><p>tension in Plateau State as a result of the September </p><p>trouble, authorities are concerned that violence of any sort </p><p>can spread and take on larger dimensions.  For now, it </p><p>appears that the authorities halted this potential dynamic </p><p>before it could expand and  assume a more minatory ethnic or </p><p>religious coloration.  End comment. </p><p>Andrews </p><p></p></div>
