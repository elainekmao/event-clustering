<p>S E C R E T SANAA 001350 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NP/MNA FOR SHIRLEY HART </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/12/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PARM, PREL, PTER, YM, COUNTER TERRORISM </p><p>SUBJECT: YEMENI NATIONAL ATOMIC ENERGY COMMISSION CHAIRMAN </p><p>TO VISIT U.S. </p><p> </p><p>REF: CATO/GALLINI AND CATO/HART E-MAILS </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Charges D\'Affaires Alan G. Misenheimer for Reasons 1.5 ( </p><p>b,d) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)   This is an action request -- see paragraph 7. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  Dr. Moustafa Bahran, Chairman of the Yemeni National </p><p>Atomic Energy Commission (NATEC), requests the Department\'s </p><p>assistance in coordinating an important visit to the U.S. to </p><p>discuss the physical security of radiological materials </p><p>(PSRM).  In 2002, NATEC entered discussions with many member </p><p>states of the IAEA on a proposed PSRM resolution to prevent </p><p>the use of radioactive materials for terror.  The Republic of </p><p>Yemen, in cooperation with the United States and the European </p><p>Union, co-drafted and co-sponsored the final resolution -- </p><p>IAEA GC/46/Res/13. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  NATEC believes GC/46/Res/13 falls short of their </p><p>expectations, and the international community can do more. </p><p>Consequently, NATEC is campaigning to strengthen the existing </p><p>PSRM resolutions during the 47th IAEA General Conference in </p><p>September 2003.  NATEC intends to submit at text on PSRM, </p><p>stressing the difficulties caused by the historical </p><p>entanglement of PSRM and the Physical Protection of Nuclear </p><p>Materials (PPNM).  According to Bahran, if progress is to be </p><p>made, PSRM must be a stand alone issue. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  Chairman Bahran held discussions with his French </p><p>counterparts in May and plans to visit England this summer on </p><p>his way back from the U.S.  NATEC intends to use the support </p><p>garnered from these consultations to move the General </p><p>Conference towards consensus, </p><p>securing the passage of their resolution. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  For his consultations in the U.S., Bahran requests </p><p>meetings with: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>a)  Department of State </p><p> </p><p>-- Bureau of Nonproliferation (specifically, Ronald Burrows </p><p>in NP/SC) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>b)  Department of Energy </p><p> </p><p>-- Courtesy call with the Secretary of Energy </p><p> </p><p>-- Meeting with the Office of International Cooperation to </p><p>discuss the peaceful use of atomic energy </p><p> </p><p>-- Meeting with NNSA\'s Office of International Protection and </p><p>Cooperation to discuss strengthening international efforts on </p><p>PSRM </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>c)  Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) </p><p> </p><p>-- Courtesy call with the Chairman of NRC </p><p> </p><p>-- Meeting with the Office of International Cooperation to </p><p>discuss radiation protection </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (S)  Dr. Bahran will be meeting with the Department of </p><p>State\'s Undersecretary for Arms Control and Nonproliferation. </p><p> U/S Bolton visits Yemen June 16-17.  Dr. Bahran is scheduled </p><p>to join the U/S for breakfast and will discuss the activities </p><p>and objectives outlined above, as well as the importance of a </p><p>regional initiative. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  Action requested:  Post appreciates NP/MNA\'s </p><p>assistance and requests their continued coordination and </p><p>scheduling of meetings for Dr. Bahran.  Dr. Bahran would like </p><p>to travel as soon as possible and has a multiple entry visa. </p><p>However, his assistant does not.  Consequently, the earliest </p><p>his delegation will be ready to depart is early July.  POC </p><p>for questions concerning Dr. Bahran\'s visit is Pol/Econ </p><p>Officer Willeah Cato.  She can be contacted via unclass and </p><p>class e-mail: catowe@state.gov or catowe@state.sgov.gov, </p><p>phone at (967) 1 303 - 155 x2155, or fax at (967) 1 303 - </p><p>259.  A fax outlining NATEC\'s objectives and Bahran\'s </p><p>proposed agenda during his visit to Washington has been </p><p>forwarded to NP/MNA for Shirley Hart and NEA/ARP for Michael </p><p>Miller. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MISENHEIMER </p><p></p></div>
