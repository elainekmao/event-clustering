(SBU) ITALY\'S LABOR UNIONS ARE GETTING A LOT OF PRESS FOR </p><p>THEIR ROLE IN DISRUPTING TRANSHIPMENT OF U.S. MILITARY </p><p>EQUIPMENT AND CARGO, BUT THE REAL HEADLINE IS THAT THEY\'RE </p><p>NOT THE MOST OBSTRUCTIVE, OR DANGEROUS, OBSTACLE.  ITALIAN </p><p>LABOR SHOULD EXPRESS ITS OPPOSITION TO U.S. MILITARY </p><p>PLANNING AND ACTION WITHIN THE ESTABLISHED SYSTEM OF RULES </p><p>AND BEHAVIOR GOVERNED BY LABOR LAW AND ACCEPTED CONVENTION. </p><p>UNIONS WILL STAGE SYMBOLIC STRIKES AND REFUSE TO HANDLE U.S. </p><p>MILITARY CARGO.  THEY SHOULDN\'T ILLEGALLY BLOCK PORT </p><p>ENTRANCES OR TRY TO PREVENT CARGO FROM MOVING FROM CAMP </p><p>DARBY TO THE PORT OF LIVORNO (THOUGH THE LARGEST UNION IS </p><p>STRETCHING THE LIMITS BY COORDINATING WITH LESS SCRUPULOUS </p><p>PROTESTORS).  LABOR HAS BEEN AVOIDING OUR CALLS, BUT WE WILL </p><p>CONTINUE TO UNDERSCORE OUR HOPE THAT THEY WILL AVOID THE </p><p>KIND OF CONFRONTATIONAL TACTICS THAT COULD LEAD TO VIOLENCE. </p><p>BY EXTENSION, ITALIAN LABOR SHOULD POSE ONLY SYMBOLIC, </p><p>MINIMAL DISRUPTIONS TO U.S. MILITARY OPERATIONS FROM BASES </p><p>IN ITALY IF WE DECIDE TO PURSUE MILITARY ACTION AGAINST </p><p>IRAQ.  OTHER OPPONENTS, ESPECIALLY THOSE DRAWN FROM THE ANTI- </p><p>GLOBALIZATION MOVEMENT, MAY ATTEMPT MORE CONFRONTATIONAL, </p><p>DISRUPTIVE ACTIONS (SEPTEL).  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) ITALIAN UNIONS, NEVER SHRINKING VIOLETS, HAVE </p><p>FIGURED PROMINENTLY OVER THE LAST TWO WEEKS IN PROTESTS </p><p>AGAINST TRANSHIPMENT OF U.S. MATERIEL AND OTHER MILITARY </p><p>CARGO IN NORTHERN ITALY.  UNIONIZED FREIGHT ENGINEERS </p><p>REPORTEDLY ALERTED ANTI-WAR PROTESTORS TO IMPENDING CARGO </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  00928  01 OF 02  061453Z </p><p>CONVOYS FROM SETAF IN VINCENZA, ENABLING THEM TO DELAY </p><p>SHIPMENTS ON FEBRUARY 21 (REFTELS).  UNION OFFICIALS ALSO </p><p>HAVE ANNOUNCED THEIR MEMBERS WILL NOT HANDLE U.S. MILITARY </p><p>CARGO IN ITALIAN PORTS, INCLUDING LIVORNO (WHERE VEHICLES, </p><p>EQUIPMENT, AMMUNITION AND OTHER CARGO CURRENTLY LOCATED AT </p><p>CAMP DARBY WILL BE LOADED FOR SHIPMENT TO SW ASIA).  THE </p><p>TRADE UNIONISTS\' NOISY ACTIVISM COULD SUGGEST THAT ITALIAN </p><p>UNIONS WOULD BE AT THE CENTER OF ANY AND ALL EFFORTS TO </p><p>IMPEDE OR BLOCK EQUIPMENT SHIPMENTS OR DISRUPT OPERATIONS ON </p><p>BASES FROM WHICH U.S. FORCES OPERATE.  WE BELIEVE THAT </p><p>OVERSTATES THE CASE.  UNION ANTIWAR ACTIVITY SHOULD POSE </p><p>ONLY LIMITED PRACTICAL OBSTACLES FOR U.S. MILITARY CARGO </p><p>SHIPMENTS AND OTHER SUPPORT OPERATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) THE POTENTIAL WAR IN IRAQ IS ONLY THE LATEST ISSUE </p><p>DIVIDING ITALY\'S THREE MAJOR LABOR CONFEDERATIONS.  THERE IS </p><p>SUBSTANTIAL OVERLAP BETWEEN THE CONFEDERATIONS\' POSITIONS. </p><p>THEIR DIFFERENCES ARE SUBSTANTIAL ENOUGH, HOWEVER, TO </p><p>PREVENT THEM FROM PURSUING THE TYPES OF COORDINATED PROTESTS </p><p>THAT MIGHT REALLY CAUSE PROBLEMS FOR US AND FOR THE </p><p>BERLUSCONI GOVERNMENT. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) THE TWO LARGEST TRADE UNION CONFEDERATIONS OPPOSE </p><p>ANY USE OF FORCE IN IRAQ, THOUGH FOR DIFFERENT REASONS. </p><p>ITALY\'S LARGEST (5.4 MILLION MEMBERS), MOST-LEFTIST </p><p>CONFEDERATION, THE GENERAL CONFEDERATION OF ITALIAN LABOR </p><p>(CGIL) HAS SHOWN THE MOST FERVOR IN OPPOSING U.S. POLICY AND </p><p>PREPARATIONS.  WITH 75% OF DOCKWORKERS AMONG ITS MEMBERSHIP, </p><p>IT\'S THE MOST IMPORTANT UNION IN THIS CONTEXT.  CGIL\'S </p><p>HISTORICALLY CLOSE ASSOCIATION WITH ITALY\'S COMMUNIST PARTY </p><p>MAKES MOST OF ITS MEMBERSHIP IDEOLOGICALLY PREDISPOSED TO </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  00928  01 OF 02  061453Z </p><p>OPPOSE ALMOST ANY USE OF FORCE BY THE U.S.  MOREOVER, CGIL </p><p>HAS THE MOST NAKEDLY POLITICAL OBJECTIVES OF THE THREE </p><p>CONFEDERATIONS, ESCHEWING DISCUSSIONS AND ANY FORM OF </p><p>COMPROMISE WITH THE BERLUSCONI GOVERNMENT - ON ANY ISSUE - </p><p>IN FAVOR OF CONFRONTATION. IN THAT CONTEXT, ITS STRIDENT </p><p>ANTIWAR POSITION REFLECTS ITS DESIRE TO INFLICT THE HIGHEST </p><p>POSSIBLE POLITICAL COSTS ON THE BERLUSCONI GOVERNMENT FOR </p><p>ITS DECISION TO SUPPORT THE U.S. (COMMENT: IT\'S AN APPROACH </p><p>THAT REFLECTS EX-LEADER COFERATTI\'S HOPE TO JOIN EU </p><p>COMMISSION PRESIDENT PRODI IN A TICKET TO LEAD THE LEFT IN </p><p>THE NEXT NATIONAL ELECTIONS - AND ONE SHARED BY  ITALY\'S </p><p>OPPOSITION MORE BROADLY.  POTENTIAL MILITARY ACTION IN IRAQ </p><p>IS JUST THE LATEST ISSUE BY WHICH THE FRACTIOUS OPPOSITION </p><p>PARTIES SEEK TO WEAKEN THE BERLUSCONI GOVERNMENT. THE CENTER- </p><p>LEFT HAS BEEN ABLE TO ALIGN ITSELF WITH A STRONG MAJORITY OF </p><p>ITALIANS OPPOSING WAR, BUYING IT AT LEAST SOME SHORT-TERM </p><p>POLITICAL GAINS.) </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) THE STRONG CATHOLIC ROOTS OF THE SECOND-LARGEST (4 </p><p>MILLION) CONFEDERATION, THE ITALIAN CONFEDERATION OF LABOR </p><p>UNIONS (CISL) PRESAGE ITS STAUNCH ANTIWAR POSITION.

BUT THE CHURCH\'S STRONG EMPHASIS </p><p>ON ORDER, HIERARCHY AND SOCIAL COMITY MEANS CISL ALSO IS </p><p>RELUCTANT TO ENGAGE IN CONFRONTATIONAL TACTICS OR ILLEGAL </p><p>ACTION.  (COMMENT:  MEMBERS OF THIS CATHOLIC-AFFILIATED </p><p>UNION NONETHELESS MAY RESORT TO CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE TACTICS </p><p>DURING ANTI-WAR DEMONSTRATIONS THAT WOULD FOLLOW USE OF </p><p>FORCE AGAINST IRAQ). </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) BY CONTRAST, THE SMALLEST OF THE THREE CONFEDERATIONS </p><p>(THOUGH STILL A POTENT SOCIAL FORCE WITH 1.8 MILLION </p><p>MEMBERS), THE ITALIAN UNION OF LABOR (UIL), REFUSED TO </p><p>PARTICIPATE IN THE ROME PEACE MARCH FEBRUARY 15 FOR FEAR OF </p><p>DELEGITIMIZING THE UN.  THE UIL WAS UNWILLING TO ACCEPT THE </p><p>OTHER TWO CONFEDERATIONS\' ASSERTIONS THAT WAR IS NEVER AN </p><p>ACCEPTABLE ALTERNATIVE, ARGUING THAT UNSC-SANCTIONED </p><p>CONFLICT MIGHT BE UNDESIRABLE BUT WOULD BE LEGITIMATE. </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) REGARDLESS OF THEIR PHILOSOPHICAL POSITIONS ON </p><p>MILITARY ACTION, ALL THREE CONFEDERATIONS STRESS THE </p><p>IMPORTANCE OF LEGAL ACTION.  WHEN THE TRANSHIPMENT ISSUE </p><p>FIRST BROKE O/A FEBRUARY 21, CGIL AND CISL LEADERS EPIFANI </p><p>AND PEZZOTA ISSUED A JOINT STATEMENT SUPPORTING TRAIN </p><p>ENGINEERS WHO DID NOT WISH TO TRANSPORT THE CARGO, ARGUING </p><p>THE CARGO COULD BE DANGEROUS AND THEREFORE COULD CREATE </p><p>HAZARDOUS WORKING CONDITIONS FOR THEIR MEMBERS. THEY ASKED </p><p>THE GOI TO PROMPTLY INFORM WORKERS ABOUT MATERIALS </p><p>TRANSPORTED. BUT THEY ALSO CALLED ON ALL THEIR MEMBERS ONLY </p><p>TO PURSUE LEGAL ACTIONS.  AT A FEBRUARY 27 RALLY IN LIVORNO, </p><p>EPIFANI STRESSED THAT THE UNION MEMBERS WOULD REFUSE TO </p><p>HANDLE U.S. MILITARY CARGO WITHIN THE PORT, AND WOULD STRIKE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  00928  02 OF 02  061453Z </p><p>TO AVOID DOING SO.  BUT HE ALSO SAID THEY WOULD NOT ATTEMPT </p><p>TO BLOCK DELIVERY OF U.S. VEHICLES AND EQUIPMENT OR JOIN </p><p>`DISOBEDIENT\' PROTESTORS IN OTHER ACTIONS - PERHAPS WITH AN </p><p>EYE TO THE FINES AND OTHER PENALTIES THAT COULD BE IMPOSED </p><p>ON THE FEDERATION FOR VIOLATING ELEMENTS OF ITALIAN LABOR </p><p>LAW. PEZZOTA AS WELL REPEATEDLY HAS STATED THAT "BOYCOTTS </p><p>AND RAIL BLOCKADES DON\'T ADVANCE THE CAUSE OF PEACE." </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) THERE IS EVIDENCE OF AT LEAST INFORMAL, LOCAL </p><p>COORDINATION BETWEEN CGIL MEMBERS AND THE `DISOBEDIENTS,\' </p><p>MORE MILITANT PROTESTORS, MANY DRAWN FROM THE ANTI- </p><p>GLOBALIZATION MOVEMENT, WITH FEWER QUALMS ABOUT EMPLOYING </p><p>CONFRONTATIONAL TACTICS (SEE REFS C AND D). CGIL APPEARS TO </p><p>HAVE DECIDED TO CONFINE ITS ACTIONS TO WITHIN THE PORT, </p><p>LEAVING PROTESTS AND OTHER POTENTIALLY DISRUPTIVE MEASURES </p><p>BETWEEN DARBY AND THE PORT TO THE `DISOBEDIENTS.\' </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) CGIL\'S ACTIONS MAY COMPLICATE THE MILITARY CARGO\'S </p><p>FINAL MOVEMENT FROM SHORE TO SHIP, BUT WE SEE NOTHING TO </p><p>INDICATE IT (OR THE OTHER ITALIAN UNIONS) ARE CONTEMPLATING </p><p>MORE AGGRESSIVE, POTENTIALLY VIOLENT ACTION TO PREVENT THE </p><p>CARGO\'S ULTIMATE DEPARTURE.  MOREOVER, THE CONFEDERATIONS\' </p><p>STRONG EMPHASIS ON LEGAL ACTION SUGGESTS THAT ANY LABOR </p><p>ACTIONS ON U.S. BASES (WHERE CGIL IS NOT REPRESENTED) DURING </p><p>A CONFLICT SHOULD BE LARGELY SYMBOLIC, ALTHOUGH STRIKES OR </p><p>REFUSAL TO PERFORM CERTAIN TASKS, WHICH COULD POTENTIALLY </p><p>DISRUPT OPERATIONS, CANNOT BE COMPLETELY RULED OUT.  WE WILL </p><p>REPORT SEPARATELY ON THE GREATER POTENTIAL FOR "NO-GLOBAL" </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS TO ORGANIZE TO DISRUPT TRANSIT AND USE OF </p><p>ITALIAN BASES IN EVENT OF ACTUAL HOSTILITIES. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  00928  02 OF 02  061453Z </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2003ROME00928 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
