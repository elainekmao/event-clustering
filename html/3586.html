<p>UNCLAS AMMAN 004843 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>ROME FOR CASLO KARL BROWN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAIR, JO, ICAO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDANIAN VIEWS ON ICAO SYG, DESIRE FOR SEAT ON </p><p>ICAO COUNCIL </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 134749 </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED, PLEASE HANDLE ACCORDINGLY </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Jordanian Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) Director </p><p>General Hanna Najjar told us August 22 he agrees with the </p><p>U.S. view that it is appropriate that the ICAO seek new </p><p>leadership following the expiration of current SYG Renato </p><p>Costa Pereira\'s second term in office.  Najjar said that </p><p>while Pereira had done "a fine job", two four-year terms were </p><p>enough.  He added that the Jordanian government had not yet </p><p>considered who to support for the post and had not been </p><p>approached by any potential candidates. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Najjar said that as previously discussed between </p><p>Jordanian officials and US Ambassador to the ICAO Stimpson, </p><p>Jordan\'s priority interest is in gaining a seat on the ICAO </p><p>Council.  Najjar said this would reinforce Jordan\'s position </p><p>as a regional leader on aviation security issues.  We said we </p><p>would pass along Najjar\'s comments. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) COMMENT:  Jordan has indeed been working hard to </p><p>stake out a leading position on aviation security issues, </p><p>working closely with the United States and with ICAO.  At the </p><p>March ICAO ministerial, Jordan took a leading role in </p><p>attempting to organize a common Arab position in support of </p><p>U.S. initiatives.  Since March, Jordan has been working with </p><p>ICAO to organize a regional training program for aviation </p><p>security auditors.  Its cooperation with the United States on </p><p>aviation security issues post-September 11 has been </p><p>consistent and valuable, a position reinforced by a recent </p><p>and positive assessment of Jordan\'s aviation security posture </p><p>by the Transportation Security Administration.  We believe </p><p>that as a member of the Council, Jordan would share the U. S. </p><p>approach to aviation security and other aviation initiatives. </p><p> </p><p>BERRY </p><p></p></div>
