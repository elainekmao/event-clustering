THE KOUANKAN REFUGEE CAMP, LOCATED IN N\'ZEREKORE </p><p>PREFECTURE, WAS CREATED FOR 20,000 PERSONS AND IS </p><p>CURRENTLY EXCEEDING ITS CAPACITY BY 14,000.  THE </p><p>POPULATION SIZE BEGAN EXPANDING FROM 13,500 LAST </p><p>SPRING WHEN LIBERIANS STARTED CROSSING THE GUINEA </p><p>BORDER IN LARGE NUMBERS.

WFP </p><p>RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT THIS, AS IT WAS FAIRLY CERTAIN </p><p>THAT LURD OR AT A MINIMUM, LURD FAMILIES, WERE </p><p>RECEIVING WFP FOOD.  ON AUGUST 22, THE U.N. </p><p>HUMANITARIAN CONTACT GROUP MET IN CONAKRY TO DISCUSS </p><p>MANAGEMENT OF THE NEW INFLUX INTO KOUANKAN, AS WELL </p><p>AS THE REFUGEES\' SECURITY.

SINCE MANY OF THE SIERRA </p><p>LEONEAN REFUGEES HAVE LEFT THE CAMPS IN ALBADARIAH, </p><p>THE TRANSFERRED LIBERIAN REFUGEES COULD GO INTO THE </p><p>SPACES VACATED BY THE SIERRA LEONEANS. </p><p> </p><p>7.  THE TRANSFER WOULD ALSO SERVE TO SEPARATE OUT THE </p><p>COMBATANTS, AS IT IS UNLIKELY THEY WOULD CHOOSE TO </p><p>MOVE FAR FROM THE BORDER WITH LIBERIA, ALTHOUGH </p><p>SECURITY CONCERNS SHOULD NOT BE DISMISSED.  ANY </p><p>REFUGEES CHOOSING NOT TO MOVE WOULD NO LONGER QUALIFY </p><p>FOR INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE. </p><p> </p><p>8.  EVEN THOUGH THIS DECISION WAS TAKEN ON AUGUST 22, </p><p>THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE DECISION HAS BEEN SLOW- </p><p>GOING.  UNHCR HAS DISTRIBUTED A TIMELINE FOR THE </p><p>TRANSFER THAT BEGINS MID-NOVEMBER, BUT ITS </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION IS DEPENDENT UPON FUNDING, WHICH UNHCR </p><p>CALCULATES TO BE 5.6 MILLION USD.

NGOS AND ECHO HAVE EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT </p><p>RELOCATION MODALITIES AS DEVELOPED BY UNHCR.  WFP </p><p>PREFERS TO PROCEED IMMEDIATELY WITH A SIMPLE LOW-KEY </p><p>RELOCATION OF THE REFUGEES WHO ARRIVED SINCE APRIL </p><p>(ABOU </p><p>T 15,000).  THEY ARE OF A DIFFERENT ETHNIC GROUP </p><p>AND ARE REPORTEDLY OFTEN ABUSED AND HARASSED BY THE </p><p>OLDER CASELOAD.  SUCH AN INITIAL TRANSFER WOULD </p><p>IMPROVE THE MANAGEMENT AND SECURITY AT KOUANKAN CAMP. </p><p>THE NGOS AND ECHO SUPPORT THIS APPROACH.  ONCE THE </p><p>FIRST PHASE IS COMPLETED, KOUANKAN COULD BE </p><p>REASSESSED AND THE SECOND PHASE, I.E. RELOCATION OF </p><p>THE OLD CASELOAD, COULD PROCEED WITH THE AIM OF </p><p>STOPPING ASSISTANCE BY END OF MARCH IN KOUANKAN.  WFP </p><p>INTENDS TO PRESENT THIS OPTION AGAIN TO THE U.N. </p><p>HUMANITARIAN CONTACT GROUP IN THE COMING DAYS. </p><p> </p><p>11.  MEANWHILE, THE WFP COUNTRY REPRESENTATIVE, GEMMO </p><p>LODESANI, HAS PRELIMINARILY SAID THAT WFP WILL STOP </p><p>DISTRIBUTING FOOD IN KOUANKAN AS OF JANUARY 1, 2003, </p><p>IF THE TRANSFER IS NOT UNDERWAY.  WFP FEELS THE </p><p>TRANSFER IS URGENT, AS IT FEARS THAT VIOLENCE COULD </p><p>SOON BREAK OUT IN THE CAMP. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>VERIFYING NUMBERS </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  UNHCR CONDUCTED A VERIFICATION EXERCISE IN </p><p>AUGUST TO DETERMINE THE NUMBER OF REFUGEES IN </p><p>KOUANKAN, AS THE FIGURE OF CAMP INHABITANTS HAD RISEN </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  05454  03 OF 10  071546Z </p><p>TO 33,532.  WHEN UNHCR ANNOUNCED IT WAS GOING TO </p><p>CONDUCT A VERIFICATION EXERCISE, THE REFUGEES </p><p>COMPLAINED AND SAID THEY NEEDED TEN DAY\'S TIME TO </p><p>PREPARE, AS SOME REFUGEES WERE ABSENT FROM THE CAMP </p><p>ON VACATION.  UNHCR WAITED THE REQUESTED TIME AND </p><p>CONDUCTED THE VERIFICATION AT THE END OF AUGUST, </p><p>APPLYING PLASTIC WRIST BANDS TO THE HEADS OF </p><p>HOUSEHOLD, BUT FAMILY MEMBERS WERE NOT REQUIRED TO </p><p>APPEAR.  THIS EXERCISE YIELDED A NEW COUNT OF 28,715. </p><p> </p><p>13.  BECAUSE UNHCR REALIZED THERE HAD BEEN PROBLEMS </p><p>WITH THE VERIFICATION, IT DECIDED TO REPEAT THE </p><p>VERIFICATION.  THE RE-VERIFICATION, WHICH ULTIMATELY </p><p>TOOK OVER TWO WEEKS TO COMPLETE, WAS ONGOING DURING </p><p>THE USAID TEAM\'S VISIT ON OCTOBER 5.  THE RE- </p><p>VERIFICATION REQUIRED THOSE WITH BRACELETS TO PRESENT </p><p>ALL FAMILY MEMBERS.  EVEN SO, THERE WERE REPORTS OF </p><p>FAMILIES RENTING CHILDREN.  THE RE-VERIFICATION </p><p>YIELDED A REFUGEE POPULATION OF 34,000, WHICH CALLS </p><p>INTO QUESTION THE ACCURACY OF THE RE-VERIFICATION. </p><p> </p><p>14.

SUCH STRATEGIES WOULD INCLUDE FOOD- </p><p>FOR-WORK, FOOD-FOR-TRAINING, AND INCOME GENERATING </p><p>ACTIVITIES AND WOULD TARGET THE VERY BOTTOM OF THE </p><p>SOCIO-ECONOMIC STRUCTURE AMONG THE REFUGEES, AS WELL </p><p>AS THE LOCAL POPULATION.
