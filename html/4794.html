<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 003344 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/19/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, KDEM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: KADUNA GOVERNOR BLAMES RECENT VIOLENCE ON </p><p> RADICAL MUSLIMS AND OUTSIDE AGITATORS </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER; REASONS 1.5 (B) </p><p>AND (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY: During a December 11 meeting with </p><p>International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Deputy </p><p>Assistant Secretary Steven Schrage and Ambassador Jeter, </p><p>Kaduna State Governor Ahmed Makarfi discussed the late </p><p>November violence in Kaduna.  Makarfi blamed the riots on </p><p>pro-sharia Islamic groups and agitators from outside </p><p>Kaduna.  He acknowledged that religious tensions acted as </p><p>kindling; however, he said the motivations of those who </p><p>actually lit the fire were "purely political".  Later, in a </p><p>private conversation with Ambassador Jeter, Makarfi laid </p><p>much of the blame at the feet of Vice President Atiku and </p><p>National Security Advisor Aliyu Mohammed.  Makarfi said </p><p>that in their attempts to embarrass President Obasanjo and </p><p>undermine his popularity the two political heavyweights had </p><p>unleashed forces they could not control.  Finally, while </p><p>the governor praised the military for its handling of the </p><p>incident, he had no kind words for the Nigerian National </p><p>Police (NNP) and other civilian security agencies.  Were it </p><p>not for their inept handling of the situation, said </p><p>Makarfi, the violence might well have been averted.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) During a December 11 meeting with INL DAS Schrage </p><p>and Ambassador Jeter, Kaduna State governor Makarfi </p><p>discussed the late November violence in Kaduna.  Ambassador </p><p>emphasized that Kaduna, with its ethnically and religiously </p><p>diverse population, had the potential to be an example for </p><p>the rest of Nigeria if incidences of civil unrest could be </p><p>minimized. Makarfi acknowledged that rising tension between </p><p>Kaduna\'s Christian and Muslim populations was of grave </p><p>concern, but he thought the root of the problem was </p><p>politics, not religion. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Makarfi said the unrest had nothing to do with the </p><p>many peaceful Muslim processions taking place in Kaduna. </p><p>The violence began when members of radical Islamic groups, </p><p>collectively known as Izala, incited the crowds to act. </p><p>Emphasizing that the riots were planned, Makarfi noted that </p><p>there many of those arrested claimed they were paid to </p><p>attack the "This Day" newspaper office or to burn the </p><p>governor\'s shopping plaza.  He also claimed that the </p><p>evening before the riots began, he had heard reports of </p><p>people dropping tires in strategic locations around Kaduna </p><p>so they would be available to be burned the next day. </p><p>Makarfi was astounded that neither the Nigerian police nor </p><p>the intelligence service was able to pick up these signs of </p><p>impending trouble. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Makarfi specifically noted the pernicious influence </p><p>of the "Supreme Council for Sharia Law".  The governor </p><p>accused this group of helping to incite the riots in order </p><p>to hasten the introduction of sharia law into Kaduna State. </p><p>Makarfi said this group would be the likely source of </p><p>future problems for him and Kaduna because of the </p><p>governor\'s disdain for sharia law.  Noting that the Muslim </p><p>community is sharply divided between radicals and </p><p>moderates, Makarfi said he would work to remove the </p><p>influence of this group from Kaduna and vowed to support </p><p>those that would join him in the fight.  He said this would </p><p>be a showdown and he welcomed it. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Later, in a private conversation with the </p><p>Ambassador, Makarfi further emphasized the political nature </p><p>of the violence by placing much of the blame on Vice </p><p>President Atiku Abubakar and National Security Advisor </p><p>Aliyu Mohammed.  Makarfi accused the VP and NSA of </p><p>fomenting violence in Katsina, Nasarawa, and Benue in </p><p>addition to Kaduna.  The governor allowed that the VP and </p><p>NSA may have only wanted to cause minor unrest in order to </p><p>embarrass and weaken President Obasanjo.  Unfortunately, </p><p>said Makarfi, the duo let loose forces that they could not </p><p>control.  When asked what the USG might be able to do help </p><p>the situation, Makarfi suggested that the USG speak with </p><p>the VP and NSA and demand that they desist. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) While Makarfi gave the military good marks for its </p><p>handling of the crisis, his review of the NNP\'s performance </p><p>was scathing.  Makarfi characterized them as being </p><p>uncoordinated, untrained and undisciplined.  He said the </p><p>police had failed miserably during the riots and that the </p><p>Police Commissioner admitted as much to him personally. </p><p>The governor noted that despite rumors that something was </p><p>in the offing and his personal order to increase local </p><p>security measures, the police did nothing to prepare </p><p>themselves for the violence that would take place in </p><p>Kaduna.  Makarfi said that when the situation finally </p><p>deteriorated to the point at which the military requested </p><p>permission to deploy, he had to overrule the Nigerian </p><p>National Police which had said military intervention was </p><p>unnecessary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Clearly exacerbated by the NNP\'s performance, </p><p>Makarfi suggested scrapping the organization all together. </p><p>He felt that most police functions could be better carried </p><p>out by local police forces.  He advocated the creation of a </p><p>"National Guard" made up of retired military personnel that </p><p>would be available to act in cases of large-scale unrest. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) When the Ambassador and Makarfi\'s conversation </p><p>turned toward the upcoming national elections, Makarfi said </p><p>the international community should pressure Obasanjo not to </p><p>run for a second term for the good of the country.  Makarfi </p><p>thought the North could accept another southerner as long </p><p>as he is not Obasanjo or another Yorba.  When the </p><p>Ambassador told Makarfi that he had heard VP Atiku had </p><p>decided to stay with the President, Makarfi changed his </p><p>tack slightly, saying Obasanjo had a chance to win the </p><p>North if he reconciled with Atiku. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Makarfi thought Ibrahim Babangida\'s support of the </p><p>candidacy of former Vice President Alex Ekwueme was a ploy </p><p>to win the presidency for IBB in 2007.  Makarfi reasoned </p><p>that if Ekwueme were to win the South-zoned presidency, he </p><p>would not run for a second term.  That would leave the door </p><p>open for IBB to run when the office is zoned to the North </p><p>in 2007. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) COMMENT: While Makarfi\'s allegations about the </p><p>VP\'s and NSA\'s roles in fomenting sectarian violence are </p><p>disturbing, it is important to keep in mind the source of </p><p>the information.  Makarfi and Atiku have long been </p><p>competitors.  Indeed, many saw Makarfi as Atiku\'s likely </p><p>replacement if Obasanjo dropped the VP.  It is possible </p><p>that political animosity may have influenced Makarfi\'s </p><p>search for the cause of unrest in his state.  END COMMENT. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
