<p>S E C R E T ABUJA 002561 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/10/2011 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PTER, PARM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: TFUS01: NIGERIA: WORKING TOGETHER TO FIGHT </p><p>TERRORISM </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 170698 </p><p>     B. ABUJA 2560 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter; Reasons 1.5 (b) </p><p>and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (S) As agreed during the October 8 meeting between the </p><p>Ambassador and the National Security Advisor (Ref B), </p><p>PolMilOff met October 9 with LTC Mohammed Idris, the NSA\'s </p><p>Military Advisor and Mohammed K. Ibrahim, Assistant Director </p><p>for International Organizations at the Ministry of Foreign </p><p>Affairs, to present Ref A demarche.  (Both Idris and Ibrahim </p><p>planned to brief their respective bosses shortly thereafter.) </p><p> Ibrahim remarked the evidence was strong though </p><p>circumstantial, but he agreed when Idris mentioned there was </p><p>surely sensitive and more compelling information that could </p><p>not be shared.  Ibrahim stated Nigeria was pleased to be </p><p>among the countries to receive a call from the White House </p><p>before the strikes is Afghanistan began.  PolMilOff replied </p><p>that the U.S. saw Nigeria as a partner and expected it to </p><p>take the lead against terrorism in Africa, particularly in </p><p>the sub-region. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) PolMilOff also passed Ibrahim and Idris a copy of a </p><p>matrix showing the ratification status for ECOWAS states of </p><p>multilateral counter-terrorism protocols, and emphasized that </p><p>ratification of pending protocols by West African states </p><p>would advance the international effort.  Here again Nigeria </p><p>could take a leadership role.  Looking at international </p><p>efforts, Ibrahim contended the U.S. should revisit its </p><p>opposition to restrictions on small arms sales to non-state </p><p>actors at the UN Small Arms Conference, implying that the </p><p>U.S. should reconsider its position.  Small arms are often </p><p>used by terrorists and are a significant threat in Africa. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Ibrahim noted that a similar Islamic school system </p><p>exists in Nigeria as the Madrasas in Pakistan, and emphasized </p><p>that poverty and education must be addressed as part of the </p><p>campaign.  Idris agreed, fearing that the poor and ignorant </p><p>in Nigeria (and in other African countries) were susceptible </p><p>to the appeal of radical groups. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (S) COMMENT: Ibrahim and Idris both appeared convinced of </p><p>the justification for U.S. actions against Al-Qa\'ida and the </p><p>Taliban, and hopefully will convey this sense to their bosses </p><p>and other Nigerian policy-makers.  If so, the demarche would </p><p>have proven to be useful in consolidating our support here. </p><p>END COMMENT. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
