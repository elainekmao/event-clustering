On August 12, Ayman Aamiri, Deputy Head of the MFA\'s </p><p>International Organizations Department, and Samer Naber, </p><p>MFA\'s Legal Advisor, told us that MFA has since conveyed all </p><p>the information on Professor Wedgwood to its Mission in New </p><p>York, where it will be further evaluated.  Naber said that </p><p>Professor Wedgwood is clearly qualified to serve on the </p><p>UNHRC, but noted that Jordan will factor in other political </p><p>considerations in deciding for whom to vote.  We encourage </p><p>USUN to contact the Jordanian Mission directly to underline </p><p>the importance the USG attaches to the Wedgwood candidacy and </p><p>encourage GOJ support. </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
