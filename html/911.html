<p>S E C R E T ADDIS ABABA 008889 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL:  11/13/07 </p><p>TAGS:  PTER, PREL, ET </p><p>SUBJECT:  DESIGNATION OF AL\'ITTIHAD AS A FOREIGN </p><p>          TERRORIST ORGANIZATION </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A)  ADDIS ABABA 8866 </p><p>      B)  STATE 194218 </p><p>      C)  ADDIS ABABA 7920 </p><p>      D)  STATE 191813 </p><p>      E)  96 ADDIS ABABA 06142 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY DCM MARTIN G. BRENNAN.  REASONS: 1.5(B), </p><p>(C) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (S)  EMBASSY APPRECIATES THE DEPARTMENT\'S RESPONSE </p><p>(REF B) TO OUR QUERY AS TO WHY AL\'ITTIHAD AL ISLAMIA </p><p>WAS NOT DESIGNATED A FOREIGN TERRORIST ORGANIZATION. </p><p>THE DEPARTMENT NOTED THE THREE CRITERIA FOR DESIGNATION </p><p>OF A TERRORIST GROUP: A FOREIGN ORGANIZATION THAT </p><p>ENGAGES IN TERRORIST ACTIVITY AND THREATENS THE </p><p>SECURITY OF UNITED STATES NATIONALS OR THE NATIONAL </p><p>SECURITY OF THE UNITED STATES. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S)  WE BELIEVE THAT AL\'ITTIHAD MEETS THESE </p><p>CRITERIA AND SHOULD BE SERIOUSLY CONSIDERED FOR </p><p>DESIGNATION AS A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION.  AL\'ITTIHAD </p><p>HAS ESTABLISHED AN EXTENSIVE RECORD OF TERRORIST </p><p>ACTIVITIES IN ETHIOPIA.  ETHIOPIAN AUTHORITIES HAVE </p><p>CREDIBLY IMPLICATED AL\'ITTIHAD IN THE JANUARY 1996 </p><p>BOMBING OF THE GHION HOTEL, THE JULY 1996 ASSASSINATION </p><p>ATTEMPT AGAINST MINISTER OF TRANSPORT AND </p><p>COMMUNICATIONS ABDUL-MEJID AND THE AUGUST 1996 BOMBING </p><p>OF THE WABE SHEBELLE HOTEL IN ADDIS ABABA.  THESE </p><p>INCIDENTS RESULTED IN INDIVIDUALS KILLED AND WOUNDED </p><p>INCLUDING FOREIGNERS.  INDEED, FOREIGNERS FREQUENT </p><p>THOSE AREAS OF THE GHION AND WABE SHEBELLE HOTELS WHERE </p><p>THE BOMBS WENT OFF.  THE EMBASSY HAD REASON TO SUSPECT </p><p>THAT THE THREAT AGAINST THE LIFE OF AMBASSADOR SHINN ON </p><p>JULY 14, 1996 (REF E) COULD HAVE BEEN LINKED TO </p><p>AL\'ITTIHAD.  WE ALSO CALL THE DEPARTMENT\'S ATTENTION TO </p><p>RECENT ROAL REPORTS (TD314/18683-97 AND TD314/09508-97) </p><p>WHICH INDICATE THAT AL\'ITTIHAD WAS INVOLVED IN THE </p><p>TRAINING/LOGISTICS OF HIT SQUADS THAT WERE TO </p><p>INFILTRATE URBAN CENTERS OF ETHIOPIA TO ATTACK </p><p>GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND FOREIGNERS. </p><p> </p><p>3. (S)  REPORTING FROM EMBASSY NAIROBI AS WELL AS THIS </p><p>EMBASSY INDICATES THAT AL\'ITTIHAD IS MAKING EVERY </p><p>EFFORT TO UNDERMINE ATTEMPTS AT ACHIEVING PEACE AND A </p><p>SEMBLANCE OF GOVERNANCE IN SOMALIA.  THERE ARE ALSO </p><p>CREDIBLE REPORTS THAT AL\'ITTIHAD IS INVOLVED IN DRUG </p><p>SMUGGLING TO FINANCE ITS ACTIVITIES.  DOCUMENTS SEIZED </p><p>BY ETHIOPIAN FORCES DURING AN AUGUST 1996 ATTACK ON  AN </p><p>AL\'ITTIHAD BASE AT LUUQ IN SOMALIA CLEARLY INDICATE </p><p>THAT AL\'ITTIHAD RECRUITS WERE RECEIVING TRAINING FROM </p><p>AFGHAN ARABS AMONG OTHERS WITH LINKS TO IRAN AND SUDAN. </p><p>AL\'ITTIHAD IS CLEARLY ACTIVELY ENGAGED WITH ELEMENTS </p><p>LINKED TO SAUDI TERRORIST USMANA BIN LADEN. </p><p> </p><p>4. (S)  BASED ON INDICATIONS RECEIVED TO DATE, </p><p>AL\'ITTIHAD IS DEDICATED TO DESTABILIZING EASTERN </p><p>ETHIOPIA AND UNDERMINING THE GOVERNMENT OF ETHIOPIA AS </p><p>WELL.  IF AL\'ITTIHAD WERE TO CONSOLIDATE ITS POSITION </p><p>IN SOMALIA, THERE IS NO DOUBT IN OUR MINDS THAT IT </p><p>WOULD EXPORT ITS BRAND OF TERRORISM AND POLITICAL ISLAM </p><p>TO OTHER COUNTRIES IN REGION.  THIS REPRESENTS A THREAT </p><p>TO U.S. INTERESTS IN THE REGION AND A DIRECT THREAT TO </p><p>AMERICANS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SHINN </p><p></p></div>
