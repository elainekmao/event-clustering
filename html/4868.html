<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 009132 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/26/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MARR, TU, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: OYMEN DENIES THAT CHP IS DISCOURAGING COOPERATION </p><p>ON IRAQ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador W. Robert Pearson, reason 1.5, </p><p>b/d. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Former Turkish NATO Permrep and current MP from the </p><p>opposition CHP </p><p>Onur Oymen told Ambassador 12/26 that reports of CHP leader </p><p>Deniz Baykal </p><p>having proposed to PM Gul that one option for Turkey was to </p><p>"do nothing" with </p><p>US on Iraq were untrue.  Oymen said that the CHP is the </p><p>opposition party and </p><p>was obliged to play the role of the opposition party. </p><p>According to Oymen, </p><p>Baykal had pressed Gul on why the GOT had not made a decision </p><p>about cooperating </p><p>with the US on Iraq.  Certainly CHP, as the opposition party, </p><p>could not say </p><p>where it stood on an issue if the GOT was not willing/ready </p><p>to take a position. </p><p>After checking with Baykal, Oymen reiterated that CHP was not </p><p>seeking to </p><p>delay a GOT response. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Meanwhile, Oymen said the CHP had been emphasizing </p><p>three points: </p><p>(a) Turkey must work for peace if possible, inter alia </p><p>because in eighty years of </p><p>independence, TU had not invaded a neighbor, </p><p>(b) any operation against Iraq must have international </p><p>legitimacy, and </p><p>(c) Turkey had to be prepared to deal with the threat of an </p><p>Iraqi second strike, </p><p>including missile defense and NATO Article 5 issues. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Oymen acknowledged that DepSecDef Wolfowitz had told </p><p>the NAC that an attack </p><p>on Turkey by Iraq would invoke Article 5, but NATO had not </p><p>made such a decision or </p><p>statement. Oymen closed by saying the US had many friends </p><p>within the CHP who </p><p>understand well the issues in the bilateral relationship and </p><p>are interested in </p><p>staying in close contact. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Comment: Whatever the CHP leadership might tell us </p><p>privately, the party is </p><p>allowing public reports that Baykal suggested to PM that </p><p>Turkey should not </p><p>participate in any US-led operation in Iraq to stand </p><p>unchallenged and creating a </p><p>perception that they stand with the majority of Turkish </p><p>public opinion and against </p><p>US Iraq policy. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
