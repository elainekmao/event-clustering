(SBU) Nasser Sweidan, office director for de facto </p><p>Finance Minister Dr. Khirbash, called A/DCM June 5 to say </p><p>that he was drafting a letter from MFA Minstate Hamdan bin </p><p>Zayid to Secretaries Powell and Evans outlining the UAEG\'s </p><p>strong interest in pursuing a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) </p><p>with the United States.  A/DCM thanked Sweidan for the </p><p>heads-up. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  Comment:   The UAE leadership is excited about </p><p>the President\'s South Carolina speech, particularly the </p><p>Middle East Free Trade Agreement concept.  Both de facto </p><p>Defense Minister Shaykh Muhammad bin Zayid and MFA Minstate </p><p>Hamdan bin Zayid have called the Ambassador to say the UAE </p><p>would like to pursue this actively and looks to us for </p><p>guidance on next steps.  Dubai Ports Authority Chairman </p><p>Sultan bin Sulayem was also very positive during recent </p><p>meetings in Washington.  We would appreciate guidance from </p><p>the Department on how we may respond to the UAE\'s </p><p>enthusiasm (would a TIFA be the first step?), and what the </p><p>potential hurdles might be (national treatment of foreign </p><p>investors, set-asides like agency laws?).  End Comment. </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
