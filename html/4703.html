GVN OFFICIALS CLAIMED THAT THE RECENTLY </p><p>CONCLUDED NATIONAL BUDDHIST CONFERENCE WAS ENTIRELY </p><p>INDEPENDENT OF GOVERNMENT CONTROL, BUT ADMITTED THAT THE GVN </p><p>MUST APPROVE ITS CONVOCATION AND HAD FINAL SAY ON ITS </p><p>ELECTED NEW LEADERS AND ORDINATIONS (OR PROMOTIONS) OF MONKS </p><p>AND NUNS.  PLANS FOR ANOTHER CATHOLIC SEMINARY (NOW </p><p>DESCRIBED AS A "BRANCH" OF THE HO CHI MINH CITY SEMINARY) </p><p>SEEM TO BE ON HOLD AS CATHOLICS SEARCH FOR A NEW SITE.  THE </p><p>GVN HAS ALREADY APPROVED A SEMINARY FOR THE RECENTLY LEGAL </p><p>SOUTHERN EVANGELICAL CHURCH OF VIETNAM (SECV) BUT THE SECV </p><p>HAS NOT TAKEN STEPS TO SET ONE UP YET.  NEITHER THE SECV NOR </p><p>ITS NORTHERN COUNTERPART (ECVN) HAS ASKED THE CRA FOR </p><p>PERMISSION TO RECEIVE NEW MEMBERS FROM ETHNIC MINORITY </p><p>CHURCHES IN THE CENTRAL OR NORTHWEST HIGHLANDS, WHICH THEY </p><p>SHOULD IN PRINCIPLE BE ABLE TO DO AS LONG AS THEY ARE "LEGAL </p><p>CHURCHES," ACCORDING TO GVN OFFICIALS.  THE ECVN IS WELCOME </p><p>TO REQUEST PERMISSION TO HOLD ITS LONG-AWAITED NATIONAL </p><p>CONFERENCE, BUT HAS NOT DONE SO, OFFICIALS CLAIMED.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) IN A MEETING WITH POL/C ON DECEMBER 11, NGUYEN THE </p><p>DOANH, DIRECTOR OF EXTERNAL RELATIONS OF THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>COMMITTEE ON RELIGION AFFAIRS (CRA), AND TRAN KHANH DU, THE </p><p>CRA\'S DIRECTOR OF BUDDHIST AFFAIRS, PROVIDED AN UPDATE ON </p><p>RECENT DEVELOPMENTS RELATED TO BUDDHIST, CATHOLIC, AND </p><p>PROTESTANT GROUPS IN VIETNAM.  POL/C NOTED THAT THE USG WAS </p><p>APPROACHING A DECISION ABOUT DESIGNATION OF "COUNTRIES OF </p><p>PARTICULAR CONCERN" UNDER THE INTERNATIONAL RELIGIOUS </p><p>FREEDOM ACT, AND HAD BEEN CONCERNED ABOUT RECENT NEGATIVE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02969  01 OF 02  300349Z </p><p>REPORTS REGARDING VIETNAM (REF C), WHICH AMBASSADOR HAD </p><p>ALREADY DISCUSSED WITH FOREIGN MINISTER NGUYEN DY NIEN (REF </p><p>B) AND WHICH HE PLANNED TO RAISE SOON WITH CRA CHAIRMAN LE </p><p>QUANG VINH.  (NOTE:  EMBASSY HAS PENDING REQUESTS TO MEET </p><p>WITH BUDDHIST, CATHOLIC, AND PROTESTANT LEADERS SEPARATELY.) </p><p> </p><p>BUDDHISTS </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  THE FIFTH NATIONAL BUDDHIST CONGRESS MET IN HANOI </p><p>DECEMBER 4-5, ELECTING ITS NEW LEADERSHIP AND DEVELOPING </p><p>GOALS FOR THE UPCOMING FIVE YEARS, AS WELL AS ORDAINING </p><p>AND/OR PROMOTING 967 MONKS AND NUNS.  DU ADMITTED THAT THE </p><p>BUDDHIST SANGHA OF VIETNAM WAS REQUIRED TO "REQUEST </p><p>PERMISSION" FROM THE GVN -- BY A FORMAL LETTER TO PRIME </p><p>MINISTER PHAN VAN KHAI -- TO HOLD THESE CONGRESSES, BUT </p><p>CLAIMED THAT PERMISSION WAS AUTOMATICALLY GIVEN, WITH THE </p><p>CRA PROVIDING APPROPRIATE NOTIFICATION TO "LOCALITIES."  THE </p><p>GVN DID NOT PROVIDE ANY FINANCIAL SUPPORT, DU NOTED, AND </p><p>EVEN CHARGED THE BUDDHISTS RENT FOR USE OF THE SOVIET-ERA </p><p>HALL OF CULTURE IN DOWNTOWN HANOI, ONE OF THE FEW VENUES BIG </p><p>ENOUGH FOR THE 1,000-PLUS ATTENDEES. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  DU STRESSED THAT, WHILE GVN OFFICIALS ATTENDED THE </p><p>OPENING CEREMONY, THEY DID NOT PARTICIPATE IN ENSUING </p><p>DISCUSSIONS NOR HAVE ANY RIGHT TO VOTE ON LEADERSHIP AND </p><p>OTHER ISSUES.  HE SAID THAT THE LEADERSHIP ELECTIONS </p><p>FEATURED MORE CANDIDATES THAN SEATS, A DEMOCRATIC </p><p>DEVELOPMENT.  IN RESPONSE TO PERSISTENT QUESTIONING, DU </p><p>ADMITTED FINALLY THAT THE BUDDHISTS WERE OBLIGED TO SEND THE </p><p>FINAL LISTS OF NEW LEADERS TO THE GVN FOR "APPROVAL," BUT </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02969  01 OF 02  300349Z </p><p>CLAIMED THAT THIS PROCESS WAS ALSO PRETTY MUCH AUTOMATIC. </p><p>THE GVN HAD NOT VETOED ANY INDIVIDUALS FROM THIS CONGRESS\' </p><p>CHOICES, NOR COULD DU RECALL THE GVN HAVING DONE SO AT </p><p>EARLIER CONGRESSES (ALTHOUGH DOANH ADMITTED THE GVN HAD DONE </p><p>SO WITH EARLIER CATHOLIC CONGRESSES). </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  DU CLARIFIED THAT MANY OF THE 967 ORDINATIONS </p><p>INVOLVED CLERICAL PROMOTIONS, SUCH AS FROM "THE VENERABLE" </p><p>TO "THE MOST VENERABLE."  DU SAID THAT THESE DECISIONS, AS </p><p>WELL AS ORDINATIONS OF NEW MONKS AND NUNS, WERE MADE BY THE </p><p>BUDDHIST HIERARCHY, BUT CONFIRMED THAT THE CRA PLAYED A ROLE </p><p>IN "ASKING THE OPINIONS OF LOCALITIES" ABOUT THE MERITS OF </p><p>THESE INDIVIDUALS BEFORE PROVIDING THE GVN\'S FORMAL </p><p>BLESSING.  HE SAID IT WAS "RARE" NOT TO APPROVE. </p><p> </p><p>CATHOLICS </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  DOANH EXPRESSED THE GVN\'S SATISFACTION WITH THE </p><p>RECENT APPOINTMENT (REF A) OF A NEW BISHOP FOR HAIPHONG AND </p><p>A COADJUTOR BISHOP IN CAN THO.  (HE DID NOT MENTION THE </p><p>APPOINTMENT OF A SUCCESSOR TO THE BISHOP OF KON TUM.)  HE </p><p>CONFIRMED THAT THE VATICAN HAD THE FULL AUTHORITY TO APPOINT </p><p>BISHOPS, WHILE THE ROLE OF THE GVN WAS MERELY TO "OFFER </p><p>OPINIONS."  HE CLAIMED THAT THE DECISION ON THESE NEW </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ2948 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HANOI  02969  02 OF 02  300350Z </p><p>ACTION DRL-02 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   COR-01   AID-00   CIAE-00  DODE-00  SRPP-00  EAP-00 </p><p>      EB-00    UTED-00  VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00 </p><p>      L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01 </p><p>      PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    SS-00 </p><p>      STR-00   TEST-00  TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00  PMB-00   PRM-00 </p><p>      G-00     SAS-00     /008W </p><p>                  ------------------1DE54C  300350Z /30 </p><p>R 130621Z DEC 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HANOI </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 8341 </p><p>INFO AMCONSUL HO CHI MINH CITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY PHNOM PENH </p><p>AMEMBASSY VATICAN </p><p>AMEMBASSY VIENTIANE </p><p>USCINCPAC HONOLULU HI </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 02 HANOI 002969 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>APPOINTMENTS HAD BEEN MADE BEFORE THE OCTOBER VISIT OF </p><p>VATICAN DEPUTY FOREIGN MINSTER CELESTINO MIGLIORE, NOT AS A </p><p>RESULT OF HIS DISCUSSIONS HERE.  DOANH ADDED THAT THERE HAS </p><p>BEEN SOME DISCUSSION WITH THE VATICAN ABOUT A SUCCESSOR TO </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  02969  02 OF 02  300350Z </p><p>AILING CARDINAL PAUL JOSEPH PHAM DINH TUNG (WHOSE STAFF HAS </p><p>TOLD EMBASSY HE IS TOO ILL TO MEET WITH POL/C), BUT NO </p><p>DECISION HAD BEEN MADE YET. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  DOANH REITERATED THE GVN\'S DETERMINATION TO </p><p>CONTINUE TO IMPROVE RELATIONS WITH THE VATICAN, AND NOTED </p><p>GROWING "GOODWILL" ON BOTH SIDES.  HE DESCRIBED THIS PROCESS </p><p>AS PART OF THE GVN\'S OVERALL EFFORTS TO BECOME "FRIENDS WITH </p><p>EVERYONE IN THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY," HOWEVER. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U)  WHEN ASKED ABOUT PROGRESS IN THE OPENING OF A </p><p>SEVENTH CATHOLIC SEMINARY (WHICH GVN OFFICIALS TOLD EMBOFFS </p><p>LAST YEAR HAD BEEN APPROVED AT THE CENTRAL LEVEL BUT FACED </p><p>SOME RESISTANCE BY PROVINCIAL AUTHORITIES), DOANH CLAIMED </p><p>THAT THE PLANS WERE NOT FOR A SEPARATE NEW SEMINARY PER SE, </p><p>BUT RATHER FOR A "BRANCH" OF THE EXISTING -- BUT OVERCROWDED </p><p>-- SEMINARY IN HO CHI MINH CITY.  INITIALLY, THE CATHOLICS </p><p>HAD HOPED TO OPEN THE BRANCH IN DONG NAI PROVINCE (WHICH IS </p><p>WHERE MANY OF THE 1954-ERA CATHOLICS FROM THE NORTH ARE </p><p>CENTERED), BUT THESE PLANS HAVE NOW FALLEN THROUGH, DOANH </p><p>CLAIMED, WITHOUT OFFERING A CLEAR EXPLANATION OF WHY OTHER </p><p>THAN CITING "LOCAL DIFFICULTIES" OVER LAND.  HE SAID THAT </p><p>THE CATHOLICS HAD NOT YET OFFERED ANY NEW PROPOSAL ON A </p><p>DIFFERENT SITE, BUT THE PROJECT IN PRINCIPLE CONTINUED TO </p><p>HAVE GVN APPROVAL. </p><p> </p><p>PROTESTANTS </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U)  DOANH ALSO CLAIMED THAT THE GVN HAD ALREADY </p><p>APPROVED IN PRINCIPLE A PROPOSAL BY THE SECV TO OPEN A </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02969  02 OF 02  300350Z </p><p>SEMINARY FOR PASTORS IN HO CHI MINH CITY, BUT THAT THE SECV </p><p>HAS NOT DONE SO YET.  HE NOTED THAT THE SECV WAS STILL BUSY </p><p>SETTING UP ITS OFFICES (NOTE: AFTER WINNING GVN RECOGNITION </p><p>ONLY IN 2001 AND HOLDING ITS FIRST CONGRESS IN SUMMER 2002), </p><p>AND PREDICTED THAT THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A SEMINARY -- </p><p>ESPECIALLY RECRUITMENT OF QUALIFIED FACULTY -- WOULD STILL </p><p>TAKE TIME.  HE MAINTAINED THAT THIS PROCESS WAS "NOW UP TO </p><p>THE SECV." </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U)  DOANH CLAIMED THAT THE ECVN HAD NOT YET ASKED FOR </p><p>PERMISSION TO HOLD ITS NATIONAL CONGRESS (THE LAST WAS IN </p><p>1988), BUT ADDED THAT "THE GVN HAS NO REASON TO OPPOSE" IF </p><p>IT RECEIVES SUCH AN APPLICATION.  HE CLAIMED NOT TO </p><p>UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM BEHIND CONVENING THE ECVN\'S CONGRESS </p><p>AND ELECTING A NEW OFFICIAL ECVN LEADERSHIP. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U)  DOANH SAID THAT, AS FAR AS HE WAS AWARE, NEITHER </p><p>THE SECV NOR THE ECVN HAD RECEIVED APPLICATIONS FROM ETHNIC </p><p>MINORITY CHURCHES OR "ASSOCIATIONS" (CHI HOI) TO AFFILIATE </p><p>WITH EITHER ORGANIZATION, NOR HAD THE SECV OR ECVN NOTIFIED </p><p>THE CRA OF ANY SUCH DECISIONS.  (NOTE: PER REFS E AND F, </p><p>BOTH THE SECV AND ECVN ARE PROCESSING AND/OR HAVE ALREADY </p><p>APPROVED SOME REQUESTS.  END NOTE)  HE SAID THAT "IN </p><p>PRINCIPLE" SUCH EXPANSIONS WOULD NOT POSE A PROBLEM, AS LONG </p><p>AS THE NEW MEMBERS WERE "LEGAL CHURCHES."  HE STRESSED THAT </p><p>ETHNIC MINORITIES WERE "EQUAL CITIZENS" AND HAD THE SAME </p><p>RIGHTS AS OTHER VIETNAMESE, INCLUDING FREEDOM OF RELIGION. </p><p>HE WAS VAGUE ABOUT HOW HOUSE CHURCHES COULD BECOME LEGAL </p><p>CHURCHES ENTITLED TO MEMBERSHIP IN THE ECVN OR SEVN, OTHER </p><p>THAN NOTING A REQUIREMENT FOR A CERTAIN NUMBER OF MEMBERS. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02969  02 OF 02  300350Z </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  (SBU)  WHILE TRUMPETING FREEDOM OF RELIGION, THE CRA </p><p>TAKES ITS OVERSIGHT ROLE SERIOUSLY, AND REMAINS EXPLICITLY </p><p>INVOLVED IN ALL MAJOR ORGANIZATIONAL ISSUES FOR THE MAIN </p><p>RELIGIOUS GROUPINGS.  THIS LIKELY REFLECTS LESS A DEEP- </p><p>ROOTED DISTRUST OF RELIGION BY THE GVN OR COMMUNIST PARTY OF </p><p>VIETNAM (CPV) AS MUCH AS A FIRM LENINIST ORIENTATION ABOUT </p><p>THE NEED TO REGULATE AND SUPERVISE ALL SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS </p><p>IN THE INTEREST OF "NATIONAL SOLIDARITY" AND THE NEED TO </p><p>MAINTAIN STRONG POLITICAL CONTROL. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p></div>
