(C) SUMMARY:  NORWEGIAN FM PETERSEN MET WITH THE </p><p>TIGERS ON MAY 15.  DESPITE HIS BEST EFFORTS, THE TIGERS </p><p>DID NOT SAY THEY WILL RETURN TO THE TALKS, NOR DID THEY </p><p>COMMIT TO ATTEND THE TOKYO DONORS CONFERENCE.  THE </p><p>JAPANESE EMBASSY HAS CONFIRMED THAT IT HAS RECEIVED NO </p><p>FURTHER WORD FROM THE TIGERS RE TOKYO.  IN OTHER NEWS, </p><p>THE COHABITATION SITUATION REMAINS TENSE AS THE PRESIDENT </p><p>AND THE PM CONTINUE TO BICKER.  UNTIL THESE SNARLS ARE </p><p>CLEARED UP, THE GSL WILL CONTINUE TO BE IN A BIND.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) NORWEGIAN FM PRESSES TIGERS:  NORWEGIAN FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER JAN PETERSEN MET WITH LIBERATION TIGERS OF TAMIL </p><p>EELAM (LTTE) LEADER V. PRABHAKARAN AND OTHER KEY LTTE </p><p>OFFICIALS ON MAY 15.  GON DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER VIDAR </p><p>HELGESEN AND AMBASSADOR HANS BRATTSKAR ALSO PARTICIPATED </p><p>IN THE MEETING, WHICH TOOK PLACE IN THE TOWN OF </p><p>KILINOCHCHI IN THE TIGER-CONTROLLED WANNI AREA OF NORTH- </p><p>CENTRAL SRI LANKA.  PETERSEN REPORTEDLY USED THE MEETING </p><p>TO PRESS THE LTTE TO RETURN TO THE PEACE TALKS WITH THE </p><p>SRI LANKAN GOVERNMENT AND TO COMMIT TO ATTEND THE JUNE </p><p>DONORS CONFERENCE IN TOKYO.  IN RESPONSE, THE TIGERS </p><p>REITERATED THEIR POSITION THAT UNLESS IMMEDIATE ACTION </p><p>WAS TAKEN TO ADDRESS THE HUMANITARIAN SITUATION IN THE </p><p>NORTH, THEY WOULD NOT GO TO TOKYO OR RESUME PARTICIPATION </p><p>IN THE PEACE TALKS.   VOICING ANOTHER OF THEIR LONG- </p><p>STANDING DEMANDS, THE TIGERS ALSO SAID THAT THE GSL MUST </p><p>TAKE IMMEDIATE STEPS TO REDUCE THE SIZE OF ITS SECURITY </p><p>ZONES IN JAFFNA. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) JAPANESE MULL OVER TOKYO:  IN ADDITIONAL NEWS RE </p><p>THE PEACE PROCESS, KOJI YAGI, JAPANESE EMBASSY POLOFF, </p><p>TOLD US MAY 16 THAT HIS GOVERNMENT HAD NOT RECEIVED ANY </p><p>WORD FROM THE TIGERS RE THEIR ATTENDANCE AT THE TOKYO </p><p>CONFERENCE.  (NOTE:  PER REFTELS, JAPANESE SPECIAL ENVOY </p><p>AKASHI HAD SET MAY 14 AS THE DEADLINE FOR THE TIGERS TO </p><p>RECONSIDER THEIR PREVIOUS STATEMENTS THAT THEY WOULD NOT </p><p>ATTEND THE TOKYO MEETING.)  YAGI SAID HIS EMBASSY HAD </p><p>HEARD THAT THE LTTE MIGHT BE PLANNING TO SEND JAPAN A </p><p>LETTER REQUESTING A POSTPONEMENT IN THE TOKYO CONFERENCE </p><p>SO THE GSL HAD "TIME" TO MEET TIGER DEMANDS.  QUERIED AS </p><p>TO WHAT THE GOJ\'S PLANS WERE RE THE CONFERENCE AT THIS </p><p>POINT, YAGI ALLOWED THAT THE ISSUE WAS VERY PROBLEMATIC </p><p>FOR HIS GOVERNMENT.  HE SAID THE GOJ CONTINUED TO REVIEW </p><p>WHAT TO DO NEXT. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) TAMIL POLITICIANS MEET THE LTTE:  IN OTHER NEWS </p><p>RE THE PEACE TRACK, A GROUP OF TAMIL NATIONAL ALLIANCE </p><p>(TNA) POLITICIANS MET WITH THE LTTE LEADERSHIP IN THE </p><p>WANNI ON MAY 13.  AFTER THE MEETING, A JOINT LTTE-TNA </p><p>STATEMENT WAS ISSUED THAT STRESSED THE LTTE\'S CONTINUED </p><p>SUPPORT OF A NEGOTIATED POLITICAL SETTLEMENT OF THE </p><p>DISPUTE.  RE THE PEACE TALKS AND THE TOKYO CONFERENCE, </p><p>MISSION HAS HEARD THAT THE TIGERS USED THE MEETING WITH </p><p>THE TNA TO REITERATE THEIR WELL-KNOWN STANCE THAT THE GSL </p><p>HAD TO MEET THEIR DEMANDS BEFORE THEY AGREED TO </p><p>COOPERATE. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) COHABITATION BICKERING CONTINUES:  THE LATEST </p><p>NEWS RE SRI LANKA\'S TENSE COHABITATION SITUATION IS THAT </p><p>PRESIDENT KUMARATUNGA HAS SENT A LETTER TO PRIME MINISTER </p><p>RANIL WICKREMESINGHE ON MAY 14 STATING THAT SHE WOULD NOT </p><p>CHANGE HER DECISION RE THE TAKEOVER OF THE DEVELOPMENT </p><p>LOTTERIES BOARD.  (NOTE:  LATE LAST WEEK, PER REFTELS, </p><p>THE PRESIDENT ANNOUNCED THAT SHE WAS TAKING OVER THE </p><p>LOTTERIES BOARD.  THE GSL HAS REFUSED TO IMPLEMENT HER </p><p>DECISION.)  FURTHER, SHE REJECTED THE PM\'S ALLEGATION </p><p>THAT THE TAKEOVER VIOLATED THE SRI LANKAN CONSTITUTION, </p><p>ASSERTING THAT SHE HAD ACTED IN FULL CONFORMITY WITH THE </p><p>LAW.  IN TERMS OF NEXT MOVES IN THE TENSE SITUATION, THE </p><p>PM IS REPORTEDLY DRAFTING A RESPONSE TO KUMARATUNGA\'S </p><p>LATEST MISSIVE.  THERE ARE ALSO REPORTS THAT PRESIDENT </p><p>KUMARATUNGA, IN A BID TO SHOW SHE HAS CONTROL OF THE </p><p>AGENCY, IS PLANNING TO CALL FOR AN EMERGENCY MEETING OF </p><p>THE DIRECTORS OF THE LOTTERIES BOARD SOON. </p><p> </p><p>6.   (C) COMMENT:  UNTIL THE SNARLS OVER THE PEACE PROCESS </p><p>AND COHABITATION ARE CLEARED UP, THE GSL WILL CONTINUE TO </p><p>BE IN A SERIOUS BIND.  THE LTTE IS CLEARLY NOT IN THE </p><p>MOOD TO MAKE THINGS EASY FOR IT IN TERMS OF THE PEACE </p><p>TRACK.  IN THE MEANTIME, THE PRESIDENT IS CAUSING THE GSL </p><p>SERIOUS PROBLEMS WITH RESPECT TO POLITICS IN THE SOUTH. </p><p>EVEN WHEN THINGS WERE GOING MORE SMOOTHLY, THE GSL WAS </p><p>OVERLOADED ENOUGH.  THE WEIGHT OF THESE ADDED PROBLEMS </p><p>MAKES THE OVERALL CHALLENGE FOR THE GSL THAT MUCH LARGER. </p><p>END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) MINIMIZE CONSIDERED. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
