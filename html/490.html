<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 LONDON 00037 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>S/CT FOR BREELAND </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  N/A </p><p>TAGS:        PTER, UK </p><p>SUBJECT:     UNITED KINGDOM: 1991 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 346420 </p><p> </p><p>1.  FOLLOWING IS EMBASSY INPUT FOR THE UK PORTION OF THE </p><p>1991 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT.  RESPONSES TO QUESTIONS </p><p>POSED IN PARA 5 REFTEL ARE CONTAINED IN PARAS 3-10 BELOW. </p><p> </p><p>2.  EMBASSY SUGGESTS THAT THE FINAL REPORT INCORPORATE </p><p>IN SOME FASHION THE FOLLOWING POINTS ON THE THREAT POSED </p><p>BY TERRORISM TO THE UNITED KINGDOM: </p><p> </p><p>--   FOR TWO DECADES THE UNITED KINGDOM HAS FACED ONE OF </p><p>     THE MOST DETERMINED, SOPHISTICATED AND LETHAL </p><p>     TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS IN THE WORLD IN THE FORM OF </p><p>     THE PROVISIONAL IRISH REPUBLICAN ARMY (PIRA) AND </p><p>     ITS OFFSHOOTS, MOST NOTABLY THE IRISH NATIONAL </p><p>     LIBERATION ARMY (INLA) AND THE IRISH PEOPLE\'S </p><p>     LIBERATION ORGANIZATION (IPLO). </p><p> </p><p>--   THE ANNOUNCED AIM OF THE PIRA IS TO BRING ABOUT THE </p><p>     INCORPORATION OF NORTHERN IRELAND (AND THE REPUBLIC </p><p>     OF IRELAND) INTO A NEW, RADICALLY SOCIALIST, UNITED </p><p>     IRISH STATE.  ITS METHODS INCLUDE KILLING OF POLICE </p><p>     AND BRITISH ARMY FORCES IN NORTHERN IRELAND, GREAT </p><p>     BRITAIN AND THE EUROPEAN CONTINENT, AND BOMBING OF </p><p>     SHOPS, FACTORIES AND TRANSPORTATION FACILITIES </p><p>     THROUGHOUT THE UNITED KINGDOM. </p><p> </p><p>--   LARGELY IN RESPONSE TO PIRA ATTACKS, "LOYALIST" </p><p>     TERRORIST GROUPS SUCH AS THE ULSTER VOLUNTEER FORCE </p><p>     (UVF) AND ULSTER FREEDOM FIGHTERS (UFF) OVER THE </p><p>     YEARS HAVE MURDERED HUNDREDS OF CATHOLICS SUSPECTED </p><p>     OF "REPUBLICAN" SYMPATHIES. </p><p> </p><p>--   THE TOTAL NUMBER OF FATALTIES RESULTING FROM THE </p><p>     NORTHERN IRELAND "TROUBLES" SINCE 1969 NOW EXCEEDS </p><p>     3,000.  WHILE BOTH "REPUBLICAN" AND "LOYALIST" </p><p>     PARAMILITARIES INSIST THEY TARGET ONLY SECURITY </p><p>     FORCES AND TERRORISTS ON THE OTHER SIDE, MOST OF </p><p>     THEIR VICTIMS HAVE IN FACT BEEN CIVILIANS. </p><p> </p><p>--   DIRECT ECONOMIC DAMAGES RESULTING FROM BOMBING AND </p><p>     ARSON, WHILE WELL BELOW THE LEVEL OF THE EARLY </p><p>     1970\'S, STILL RUN INTO THE TENS OF MILLIONS OF </p><p>     DOLLARS A YEAR, AND THE ECONOMIC COST OF LOST </p><p>     INVESTMENT AND PRODUCTION IS MUCH HIGHER. </p><p> </p><p>--   PIRA IS BELIEVED TO HAVE ACQUIRED LARGE STOCKS OF </p><p>     ARMS AND EXPLOSIVES FROM LIBYA. </p><p> </p><p>--   INCIDENTS AND THREATS OF TERRORISM OTHER THAN THOSE </p><p>     FLOWING FROM THE NORTHERN IRELAND SITUATION ARE </p><p>     RELATIVELY FEW, BUT NOT INSIGNIFICANT.  BRITISH </p><p>     AUTHOR SALMAN RUSHDIE REMAINS UNDER THREAT FROM AN </p><p>     ASSASSINATION ORDER BY THE LATE AYATOLLAH KHOMEINI, </p><p>     AND REQUIRES CONSTANT POLICE PROTECTION.  IN </p><p>     ADDITION, BRITISH PARTICIPATION IN THE LIBERATION </p><p>     OF KUWAIT, AND THE ISSUANCE OF ARREST WARRANTS </p><p>     AGAINST LIBYAN OFFICIALS IN THE 1988 BOMBING OF PAN </p><p>     AM 103, HAVE INCREASED THE UK\'S SUSCEPTIBILITY TO </p><p>     ATTACK BY RADICAL ARAB GROUPS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  HOST GOVERNMENT PROSECUTIONS INVOLVING INTERNATIONAL </p><p>TERRORISM AND/OR SIGNIFICANT ACTS OF DOMESTIC TERRORISM: </p><p> </p><p>--   SIKH MILITANT PARAMJIT SINGH SIDHU AND TWO </p><p>     ACCOMPLICES WERE CONVICTED IN JULY 1991 OF </p><p>     CONSPIRING TO CAUSE EXPLOSIONS IN THE UK. </p><p> </p><p>--   PROSECUTION OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS IN NORTHERN </p><p>     IRELAND CONTINUES AT A HIGH LEVEL: 131 WERE TRIED, </p><p>     AND 122 CONVICTED, OF TERRORISM-RELATED OFFENSES IN </p><p>     THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 1991. </p><p> </p><p>4.  EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS FOR PROSECUTION: </p><p> </p><p>--   THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT REQUESTED EXTRADITION OF </p><p>     CONVICTED PIRA BOMBER ANGELO FUSCO FROM THE </p><p>     REPUBLIC OF IRELAND IN DECEMBER 1991; FUSCO IS </p><p>     CURRENTLY ON BAIL PENDING AN EXTRADITION HEARING. </p><p> </p><p>--   PIRA BOMB-MAKER DESSIE ELLIS, WHO HAD SERVED EIGHT </p><p>     YEARS IN THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND FOR MAKING BOMBS </p><p>     FOR USE IN NORTHERN IRELAND, WAS EXTRADITED TO </p><p>     LONDON IN NOVEMBER 1990 ON SIMILAR CHARGES </p><p>     CONCERNING THE 1980-81 BOMBING CAMPAIGN IN GREAT </p><p>     BRITAIN.  IN OCTOBER 1991 ELLIS WAS ACQUITTED, </p><p>     APPARENTLY HAVING CONVINCED A JURY THAT HE HAD </p><p>     NEITHER KNOWN NOR INTENDED THAT HIS BOMBS WOULD BE </p><p>     USED ON THE BRITISH MAINLAND. </p><p> </p><p>5.  SIGNIFICANT IMPEDIMENTS TO HOST GOVERNMENT </p><p>PROSECUTION AND/OR EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS: </p><p> </p><p>--   AS A RESULT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT FORENSIC EVIDENCE </p><p>     AND POLICE EXTRACTION OF CONFESSIONS, A NUMBER OF </p><p>     PERSONS FORMERLY CONVICTED OF TERRORIST OFFENSES ON </p><p>     THE BRITISH MAINLAND WERE RELEASED ON APPEAL DURING </p><p>     1991. </p><p> </p><p>--   EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS FROM THE </p><p>     REPUBLIC OF IRELAND REMAINS A CONTENTIOUS ISSUE, </p><p>     DESPITE IMPROVEMENTS IN PROCEDURES AND MUTUAL </p><p>     CONFIDENCE RESULTING FROM THE 1985 ANGLO-IRISH </p><p>     AGREEMENT AND DUBLIN\'S 1987 RATIFICATION OF THE </p><p>     EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON THE SUPPRESSION OF </p><p>     TERRORISM.  MANY IN IRELAND CONTINUE TO REGARD PIRA </p><p>     ATTACKS IN THE UK AS "POLITICAL OFFENSES," AND </p><p>     VIGOROUSLY OPPOSE THE EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTS IN </p><p>     THESE CASES.  THEY ALSO CONTINUE TO QUESTION </p><p>     WHETHER IRISH SUSPECTS CAN RECEIVE FAIR TRIALS IN </p><p>     BRITAIN. </p><p> </p><p>--   ON NOVEMBER 15, 1991 THE IRISH SUPREME COURT DENIED </p><p>     EXTRADITION OF TWO CONVICTED PIRA TERRORISTS WHO </p><p>     WERE WANTED ON WEAPONS POSSESSION CHARGES IN THE </p><p>     UK.  THE COURT RULED THAT UNDER EXISTING IRISH LAW </p><p>     POSSESSION -- AS OPPOSED TO USE -- OF WEAPONS WAS A </p><p>     POLITICAL OFFENSE.  THE IRISH GOVERNMENT </p><p>     SUBSEQUENTLY PROMISED TO AMEND ITS LAWS TO CLOSE </p><p>     THIS LOOPHOLE. </p><p> </p><p>6.  HOST GOVERNMENT RESPONSES OTHER THAN PROSECUTION: </p><p> </p><p>--   UK POLICY REMAINS STEADFAST IN REFUSING TO </p><p>     COUNTENANCE ANY CONCESSION TO TERRORISM, AND IS </p><p>     WHOLLY CONSISTENT WITH U.S. POLICY. </p><p> </p><p>--   UK OFFICIALS COOPERATED CLOSELY WITH THEIR U.S. </p><p>     COUNTERPARTS IN INVESTIGATING THE 1988 BOMBING OF </p><p>     PAN AM 103 OVER LOCKERBIE, SCOTLAND.  WARRANTS HAVE </p><p>     BEEN ISSUED FOR THE ARREST OF TWO LIBYAN OFFICIALS </p><p>     BELIEVED TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE BOMBING, AND THE </p><p>     UK HAS JOINED THE U.S. IN DEMANDING CESSATION OF </p><p>     LIBYAN SUPPORT FOR TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>--   THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT\'S MAIN LEGAL TOOLS IN THE </p><p>     FIGHT AGAINST TERRORISM ARE THE PREVENTION OF </p><p>     TERRORISM (TEMPORARY PROVISIONS) ACT OF 1989 (PTA </p><p>     AND THE NORTHERN IRELAND (EMERGENCY PROVISIONS) ACT </p><p>     OF 1991 (EPA).  BOTH ACTS RE-ENACTED AND AMENDED </p><p>     PROVISIONS OF EARLIER LAWS. </p><p> </p><p>--   UNDER THE PTA, THE HOME SECRETARY (OR THE SECRETARY </p><p>     OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND OR NORTHERN IRELAND, AS </p><p>     APPROPRIATE) MAY EXCLUDE PERSONS SUSPECTED OF </p><p>     INVOLVEMENT WITH TERRORISM FROM ANY PART OR ALL OF </p><p>     THE UNITED KINGDOM.  POLICE MAY DETAIN SUSPECTED </p><p>     TERRORISTS WITHOUT CHARGE FOR 48 HOURS, AND FOR A </p><p>     FURTHER FIVE DAYS WITH THE APPROVAL OF THE </p><p>     APPROPRIATE CABINET SECRETARY.  IN THE FIRST THREE </p><p>     QUARTERS OF 1991, 1,232 PERSONS WERE DETAINED UNDER </p><p>     THE PTA, AND 440 EXTENSIONS BEYOND 48 HOURS WERE </p><p>     GRANTED. </p><p> </p><p>--   THE 1991 EPA CONSOLIDATED ALL THE COUNTERTERRORISM </p><p>     PROVISIONS OF PREVIOUS LAWS THAT APPLIED </p><p>     EXCLUSIVELY TO NORTHERN IRELAND.  IT INTRODUCED NEW </p><p>     OFFENSES OF DIRECTING A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION AND </p><p>     POSSESSION OF ITEMS INTENDED FOR TERRORIST </p><p>     PURPOSES, AND GAVE AUTHORITIES NEW POWERS TO </p><p>     EXAMINE DOCUMENTS FOUND IN TERRORISM-RELATED </p><p>     SEARCHES, TO SEIZE EQUIPMENT USED TO REOPEN CLOSED </p><p>     BORDER CROSSINGS, TO INVESTIGATE THE FINANCING OF </p><p>     TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS, AND TO CONFISCATE THE </p><p>     PROCEEDS OF TERRORIST-RELATED ACTIVITIES. </p><p> </p><p>7.  MAJOR COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS UNDERTAKEN IN 1991 BY </p><p>THE HOST GOVERNMENT: </p><p> </p><p>--   IN ORDER TO ERADICATE DISCRIMINATION AGAINST </p><p>     CATHOLICS IN NORTHERN IRELAND, WHICH FUELS SUPPORT </p><p>     FOR THE PIRA, THE GOVERNMENT HAS VIGOROUSLY </p><p>     ENFORCED THE 1989 FAIR EMPLOYMENT (NORTHERN </p><p>     IRELAND) ACT.  IT HAS ALSO INVESTED LARGE SUMS IN </p><p>     INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENT AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT </p><p>     PROJECTS IN THE PROVINCE. </p><p> </p><p>--   THE GOVERNMENT HAS DECLARED PIRA, INLA, IPLO, UVF </p><p>     AND UFF TO BE "PROSCRIBED ORGANIZATIONS." </p><p>     MEMBERSHIP IN THEM IS A CRIMINAL OFFENSE, AND </p><p>     DIRECT BROADCASTS BY THEIR SPOKESMEN ARE NOT </p><p>     ALLOWED ON ELECTRONIC MEDIA. </p><p> </p><p>--   IN RESPONSE TO AN INCREASE IN TERRORIST ATTACKS BY </p><p>     LOYALIST GROUPS IN NORTHERN IRELAND, THE ROYAL </p><p>     ULSTER CONSTABULARY IN OCTOBER ESTABLISHED A </p><p>     SPECIAL POLICE UNIT TO COORDINATE INVESTIGATION OF </p><p>     THESE ATTACKS.  THE GOVERNMENT HAS ALSO AUGMENTED </p><p>     THE RUC AND BRITISH ARMY FORCES IN NORTHERN IRELAND </p><p>     TO COUNTER THE RECENT UPSURGE IN TERRORISM THERE. </p><p> </p><p>--   THE UNITED KINGDOM PARTICIPATES ACTIVELY IN SEVERAL </p><p>     INTERNATIONAL COUNTERTERRORISM FORA, COORDINATING </p><p>     ITS POSITIONS AND ACTIVITIES CLOSELY WITH THE U.S. </p><p>     AND OTHERS.  IT ALSO PROVIDES COUNTERTERRORISM </p><p>     ASSISTANCE AND EXPERTISE TO NUMEROUS GOVERNMENTS ON </p><p>     A BILATERAL BASIS. </p><p> </p><p>8.  SIGNIFICANT HOST GOVERNMENT SUPPORT FOR </p><p>INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM: </p><p> </p><p>--   THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT PROVIDES NO SUPPORT FOR ANY </p><p>     INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST ORGANIZATION, AND </p><p>     COOPERATES CLOSELY WITH THE U.S. IN APPLYING </p><p>     PRESSURE ON GOVERNMENTS THAT SUPPORT OR CONDONE </p><p>     TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>9.  PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF TERRORIST-SUPPORTING </p><p>COUNTRIES: </p><p> </p><p>--   THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT HAS MADE NO SUCH STATEMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>10.  SIGNIFICANT CHANGES SINCE 1990 IN HOST GOVERNMENT </p><p>ATTITUDE TOWARD TERRORISM: </p><p> </p><p>--   THERE HAS BEEN NO SUCH CHANGE.  THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>     REMAINS ADAMANTLY OPPOSED TO TERRORISM IN ALL FORMS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SEITZ </p><p></p></div>
