Reason: 1.5 (d), </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: UNDP will be seeking a more flexible mandate </p><p>for its operations in Burma at the January 21 meeting in New </p><p>York.  The USG should support that request, but should also </p><p>demand that UNDP and other UN agencies play a more active </p><p>role in regard to human rights monitoring and protection on a </p><p>day-to-day basis in Burma.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) UNDP has scheduled a meeting in New York on January 21 </p><p>to review UNDP\'s program in Burma.  The centerpiece of that </p><p>meeting will be an independent evaluation done in May and </p><p>June, 2002 on UNDP\'s programs here.  That assessment </p><p>basically concluded that UNDP\'s projects in Burma are being </p><p>carried out in accordance with the instructions of the </p><p>Governing Council and the Executive Board.  The report also </p><p>concluded that UNDP\'s projects are having a significant </p><p>positive impact on the intended beneficiaries.  According to </p><p>the report, UNDP\'s projects addressed all the critical areas </p><p>mandated by the Executive Board, with a strong emphasis on </p><p>the poorest segments of Burma\'s rural population.  Moreover, </p><p>most of the projects exceeded their goals and targets and all </p><p>were delivered within budget. Among the most notable </p><p>accomplishments were the establishment of "self care" </p><p>facilities in 3700 villages involving over 370,000 women; the </p><p>development of water and sanitation programs in 2400 </p><p>villages; the establishment of micro-credit schemes in 11 </p><p>townships; the creation of over 1000 community self-reliance </p><p>groups covering more than three-quarters of the target </p><p>households; and improvements in food production with the </p><p>result that 80 percent of the villages within UNDP\'s program </p><p>area are now self-sufficient in food </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) For all this success, however, the assessment also </p><p>notes that UNDP\'s programs now reach only a small percentage </p><p>(about 4 percent) of Burma\'s rural population.  The impact of </p><p>projects has also been undermined by the macro-economic </p><p>policy environment within which they are implemented.  In </p><p>addition, little has been done to deal with the devastating </p><p>impact that economic shocks and natural disasters can have on </p><p>vulnerable rural populations. Finally, but most seriously, </p><p>the sustainability of all of all of UNDP\'s projects is </p><p>questionable.  Most are now being implemented through ad hoc </p><p>structures with few, if any links, to national institutions, </p><p>such as the national health and education services.  As a </p><p>result, there is a real question as to how many will survive, </p><p>if and when UNDP funding is cut off.  The assessment traces </p><p>several of these problems -- particularly the problems </p><p>regarding sustainability -- to UNDP\'s current mandate, which </p><p>directs UNDP to allocate its resources in Burma only "to </p><p>programs which meet humanitarian and basic human needs </p><p>through projects which have a sustainable impact at the grass </p><p>roots level in the areas of primary health care, the </p><p>environment, HIV/AIDS, education and food security" and </p><p>recommends that UNDP expand that mandate to bring it in line </p><p>with that of other UN agencies in Burma. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) We basically agree with the assessment.  For all its </p><p>good work, UNDP\'s program in Burma has basically become a </p><p>high-cost, low-impact program that is not adequately serving </p><p>the needs of either donors or its intended recipients.  If </p><p>UNDP continues as it has to date, it will only ensure that </p><p>its programs reach only a fraction of the rural population </p><p>with activities whose impact and sustainability will both be </p><p>strictly limited.  To act efficiently and effectively on </p><p>behalf of Burma\'s poor, UNDP needs to be able to work on a </p><p>larger scale with local government officials and national </p><p>institutions, including representatives of social and </p><p>economic service ministries, such as the Ministries of </p><p>Health, Education and Agriculture.  Such latitude to work </p><p>with the GOB\'s economic and social service ministries will </p><p>not contribute to the repressive powers of the regime, but </p><p>will ensure that the social and economic programs that UNDP </p><p>is seeking to establish in Burma will have the institutional </p><p>underpinnings to ensure their durability.  It will also bring </p><p>UNDP\'s mandate in line with the mandates of other UN </p><p>agencies, like UNICEF (one of Aung San Suu Kyi\'s favorite </p><p>organizations), which already works closely and productively </p><p>with Burma\'s Health and Education Ministries.  That </p><p>collaboration has not compromised UNICEF\'s programs in any </p><p>sense, but has allowed it to support programs of major </p><p>importance, such as the eradication of polio, which can only </p><p>be done on a nationwide basis.  Similar flexibility in regard </p><p>to the implementation of UNDP\'s program would allow similar </p><p>results in regard to both the scope and impact of UNDP\'s </p><p>rural development programs. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) That flexibility, however, should be combined with </p><p>additional responsibilities.  If UNDP is to be granted more </p><p>flexibility to develop more effective and more valuable </p><p>programs, then the USG should also demand that it play a more </p><p>effective and forthright role in providing for not only basic </p><p>human needs, but also basic human rights in Burma.  Right </p><p>now, of all the UN agencies in Burma, only the ILO and UNHCR </p><p>have joined with ICRC in consistently bringing human rights </p><p>violations to the attention of the GOB.  While several others </p><p>(notably UNICEF and UNDP) have established relatively </p><p>widespread programs in Burma (e.g. for UNDP, in Burma\'s Dry </p><p>Zone, the Irrawaddy Delta, Shan State and remote border areas </p><p>of Chin, Kachin and Rakhine States), none have yet been </p><p>willing to play an effective monitoring, protection and </p><p>advocacy role on human rights issues.  In some cases, this </p><p>has led to severe criticism of UNDP\'s programs by groups -- </p><p>such as Aung San Suu Kyi\'s National league for Democracy -- </p><p>which have accused to the UN of turning a blind eye to the </p><p>regime\'s abuses. This neglect of human rights issues by the </p><p>UN agencies has also left day-to-day reporting on human </p><p>rights issues in the hands of politically motivated groups, </p><p>often based in Thailand, of varying credibility.  The net </p><p>result has been a situation which benefits no one, least of </p><p>all the UN agencies. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) In recent months, the GOB has shown an increased </p><p>willingness to allow human rights monitoring in sensitive </p><p>areas throughout Burma by the ILO, the ICRC and UNHCR.  The </p><p>UN, and particularly UNDP, which provides leadership for all </p><p>UN agencies here, should take advantage of this new </p><p>flexibility to lay down markers regarding its overriding </p><p>interest in protecting the basic human rights of Burma\'s </p><p>rural poor.  We have discussed this with UNDP\'s outgoing </p><p>resident coordinator and he believes, as we do, that such </p><p>human rights monitoring and advocacy work is necessary, and </p><p>can be done effectively by UNDP and the other UN agencies, </p><p>given adequate support and direction from the Governing </p><p>Council and the Executive Board. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) In short, we are convinced that UNDP needs a more </p><p>flexible mandate in order to do their job properly in Burma. </p><p>They should be able to discuss macro-economic issues of key </p><p>importance to rural populations with the relevant </p><p>authorities.  They should also be able to work with the </p><p>Burmese social and economic ministries in exactly the fashion </p><p>that other UN agencies already do.  However, we are equally </p><p>convinced that there is scope and need for greater action in </p><p>regard to the protection of human rights in all the areas </p><p>where the UN is active in Burma.  From that perspective, we </p><p>recommend that the US delegate to the upcoming UNDP meeting </p><p>discuss with UN staff and other Executive Board members the </p><p>possibility of coupling any plans to increase the flexibility </p><p>of UNDP\'s mandate in Burma with an expanded mandate in regard </p><p>to human rights monitoring and protection activities among </p><p>Burma\'s rural population.  The UN, as a body, has already </p><p>recognized its responsibility for human rights in Burma by </p><p>the appointment of a Special Rapporteur.  However, it needs </p><p>to develop the capacity to carry out those responsibilities </p><p>at a grass roots level on a day-to-day basis. Making the </p><p>protection of human rights an integral part of UNDP\'s mandate </p><p>in Burma will help meet that need. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
