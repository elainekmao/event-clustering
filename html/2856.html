<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 002200 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>USDOC FOR 4520/ITA/MAC/ONE/PAUL THANOS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/26/2007 </p><p>TAGS: ECPS, PREL, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDAN TELECOM PLANS LINKS TO BAGHDAD </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM GREGORY L. BERRY. REASONS 1.5 (B) </p><p>AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) According to Jordan Telecom (JTC) CEO Pierre Mattei, </p><p>JTC is planning to issue a request for proposals (RFP) to </p><p>construct a fiber-optic telecommunications cable link between </p><p>Amman and Baghdad within the next month.  He said that at </p><p>present all Iraqi telecom traffic is currently routed via the </p><p>Turkish satellite TurkSat, but this route would offer both </p><p>redundancy and considerably higher capacity than the </p><p>satellite link. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Mattei assured us the route would be built in </p><p>conformity with UN and ITU strictures regarding Iraq.  He </p><p>suggested an Amman-Baghdad link would be more in Western </p><p>interests than a possible Damascus-Baghdad connection, which </p><p>is an alternative being shopped by Syrian telecom interests. </p><p>Mattei added that, according to his information, the </p><p>fiber-optic cable connecting Syria and Iraq had been </p><p>virtually completed on the Syria side of the border.  (JTC is </p><p>40 percent owned by France Telecom, from which Mattei is an </p><p>employee on loan.) </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
