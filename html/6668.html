<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 000555 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O.12958: DECL: 03/22/13 </p><p>TAGS: EPET, ASEC, CASC, PGOV, PINS, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: PRESIDENT OBASANJO\'S STRATEGY FOR </p><p>HANDLING VIOLENT UPSURGE IN THE DELTA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) LAGOS 575 </p><p>-    B) LAGOS 568 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter.  Reason 1.5 </p><p>(B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: The Ijaw militants in the Delta who </p><p>instigated this latest round of communal violence are </p><p>surprisingly well armed, according to President </p><p>Obasanjo. In order to avoid a potentially bloody </p><p>confrontation, Obasanjo has opted for a strategy of </p><p>attrition and containment instead of directly </p><p>attacking the armed militants. Obasanjo hopes this </p><p>approach will protect oil production while ending the </p><p>current ethnic eruption with minimal loss of life. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) During a midnight March 21 meeting at the </p><p>Villa, Ambassador Jeter asked President Obasanjo how </p><p>the GON planned to handle the upsurge of violence in </p><p>the Delta. The Ambassador said that violence had </p><p>already caused a significant reduction in oil </p><p>production for Shell and ChevronTexaco; if the </p><p>situation were to exacerbate, it might cause a serious </p><p>dent in Nigeria\'s daily production and affect global </p><p>oil prices at a very sensitive time.  Even more </p><p>tragically, people already have been killed and </p><p>several villages razed, causing hundreds of Itsekiris </p><p>to seek refuge at the Escravos Tank Farm. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Obasanjo said he was cognizant of the </p><p>seriousness of the situation and was tracking it </p><p>closely. He had sent the Chief of Army Staff (COAS), </p><p>who is indigenous to the area, and the Chief of Navy </p><p>Staff (CNS) to assess the situation. Their report was </p><p>eye opening. The COAS stated the Ijaw militants who </p><p>initiated the fighting were surprisingly well armed. </p><p>In fact, they were better equipped than the soldiers </p><p>the GON initially deployed in response to the </p><p>violence. The Ijaws had "machine guns, rocket </p><p>launchers and bazookas," the President said. In </p><p>response, the COAS had augmented the Army\'s initial </p><p>deployment with additional men and weaponry (he did </p><p>not specify weapon types). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Obasanjo said that he had conferred with the </p><p>COAS who said he was prepared to attack the Ijaw </p><p>militants\' positions; however, that battle would be </p><p>very bloody and significant damage would be done. In </p><p>an apparent but indirect allusion to impending </p><p>elections and the overall tense security environment, </p><p>Obasanjo stated that now was not the time for more </p><p>violent confrontation. He explained that the upheaval </p><p>was basically due to political competition between the </p><p>Ijaws and Itsekiris over the demarcation of local </p><p>governments in the area. The two groups were long-time </p><p>rivals who feud frequently. Frustration over oil </p><p>revenue allocations, which the President said he </p><p>thought he had resolved, was another factor in the </p><p>Ijaw\'s militant dissatisfaction. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Instead of a frontal attack that might make </p><p>matters worse, Obasanjo said he had chosen the path of </p><p>attrition. The army would not engage the Ijaws but </p><p>would instead encircle them, hoping to hold them in </p><p>check. He hoped that within a short time, this would </p><p>starve the youth of both their ardor and ammunition. </p><p>Once they were sufficiently weakened, the army and </p><p>police would probe and begin to exploit their </p><p>weaknesses. The President did not give a timetable for </p><p>this strategy to work and, for the time being, seemed </p><p>content to wait things out. Obasanjo added that Delta </p><p>State Governor Ibori had held talks with Ijaw and </p><p>Itsekiri leaders months ago; coming out of those talks </p><p>Ibori had assured the President that all was calm. </p><p>Obasanjo intimated that further talks would be needed </p><p>but did not think Ibori would be the one to do it. The </p><p>President did not say that he would intervene </p><p>personally. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) During a luncheon today with the Ambassador, </p><p>the National Security Advisor\'s Political Advisor Ben </p><p>Obi (fully protect) expressed reservations about the </p><p>President\'s plan to resolve the Escravos impasse. </p><p>First, although from the Delta, the Chief of Army </p><p>Staff is Urhobo not Ijaw. (Obasanjo thought the COAS </p><p>was Ijaw when he had the appointment, Obi claimed.) </p><p>Because Urhobos are often at odds with the Ijaw, COAS </p><p>Ogumudia\'s influence on the Ijaws will be limited, if </p><p>not counterproductive. Second, Ijaws are deeply </p><p>involved in oil bunkering; therefore, the ability to </p><p>resupply and rearm their militants may be much greater </p><p>than the GON estimates. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) Meanwhile, evacuation operations in and around </p><p>Escravos continue.  According to reports received by </p><p>RSO/Lagos, there were still approximately 800 people </p><p>within the tank farm by late morning, but most </p><p>American citizens had been evacuated.  There were </p><p>still approximately 39 people at offshore sites </p><p>associated with Escravos.  At one point during the </p><p>morning, Ijaw militia fired three mortar rounds, one </p><p>of which landed near the Escravos Tank Farm.  The Ijaw </p><p>have repeatedly made it clear that their quarrel is </p><p>neither with GON Armed Forces nor with ChevronTexaco </p><p>but with their Itsekiri neighbors. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) COMMENT: Obasanjo\'s approach may be the only </p><p>reasonable course of action for the GON. A shootout </p><p>now would give provide ammunition to Obasanjo\'s </p><p>political opponents, who already claim that his </p><p>Administration has allowed festering ethnic tensions </p><p>to flare into open conflict, that it has failed </p><p>broadly to maintain law and order, and that when he </p><p>finally acts, it is heavy-handed and too lethal.  An </p><p>attack now could also turn the populous Ijaw community </p><p>(the largest ethnic group in the South-South and the </p><p>fourth largest in Nigeria)) against him just weeks </p><p>before the presidential election.  Moreover, Obasanjo </p><p>is caught between the "rock" of security for oil </p><p>installations and the "hard place" of human rights </p><p>concerns.  He and his advisers want to avoid a third </p><p>incident (after Odi and Zaki Biam) of military abuse </p><p>of force. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) However, the siege approach is not ideal in </p><p>terms of sustaining oil production levels and, </p><p>ultimately, might not be successful in averting a </p><p>possibly very bloody encounter between the Army and </p><p>the Ijaws. The longer the two sides are in close </p><p>proximity, however, the more likely a confrontation </p><p>becomes. Indeed, the territory the Ijaws claim they </p><p>control extends beyond the immediate area of Escravos. </p><p>Additionally, there will have to be some dialogue with </p><p>the Ijaws. While Obasanjo seems content to wait things </p><p>out, he also is aware that a protracted siege could </p><p>provoke similar flare-ups elsewhere in this important </p><p>oil-producing area.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
