This cable responds to questions raised in reftel A </p><p>regarding regulation of services at the federal and </p><p>sub-federal level. </p><p> </p><p>2. Brazil is a Federal Republic.  Brazil\'s government is </p><p>comprised of the Federal Government, 26 state governments, </p><p>one Federal District government and approximately 5,500 </p><p>municipalities.  The Brazilian Constitution lays out the </p><p>respective legislative responsibilities of each of these </p><p>governmental layers. </p><p> </p><p>3. Contrary to what was suggested in reftel B, regulatory </p><p>authority over services in Brazil resides fundamentally with </p><p>the Federal Government.  For certain services, including </p><p>conditions for the practice of professions, operation of </p><p>communication services, energy services, transportation </p><p>services, commercial services (distribution, wholesale, </p><p>etc.), and financial services, the Constitution specifically </p><p>assigns sole legislative/regulatory authority to the Federal </p><p>Government. </p><p> </p><p>4. For other areas (environmental services; educational and </p><p>training services; recreational, cultural and sporting </p><p>services; and health related services), both the Federal </p><p>Government and states are allowed to concurrently pass </p><p>legislation.  However, the Constitution stipulates that in </p><p>these areas, federal law overrides state law if the two are </p><p>inconsistent.  In areas of concurrent legislation, federal </p><p>legislation is limited to the establishment of general rules, </p><p>with state legislation providing more specificity. According </p><p>to the Constitution, for areas in which no federal law </p><p>exists, states may exercise full legislative competence. </p><p>Municipalities are able to supplement federal and state </p><p>legislation where pertinent, including in the areas of mass </p><p>transportation, health services and protection of cultural </p><p>heritage. </p><p> </p><p>5.  It should be noted that with ratification of an </p><p>international agreement, its provisions become part of </p><p>federal law.  For service areas in which no federal </p><p>legislation previously existed, the provisions of the </p><p>international agreement would establish the federal </p><p>regulation, and therefore limiting parameters, of any </p><p>sub-federal regulations. </p><p> </p><p>6. Officials within Itamaraty that are responsible for GOB </p><p>services negotiations assert that sub-federal regulations are </p><p>never inconsistent with federal regulation because all state </p><p>and municipal regulations must by law comply with federal </p><p>regulation.  The argument goes that since the inconsistent </p><p>state and municipal laws would automatically be struck down </p><p>by the courts, no attempts are made to usurp federal purview. </p><p> The clear delegation of regulatory authority as stipulated </p><p>in the Constitution supports, but doesn\'t prove this </p><p>contention.  The only enforcement mechanisms that appear to </p><p>be available are the threat of lawsuits or fines. </p><p> </p><p>7.  Post was able to identify one example of a state clearly </p><p>defying federal regulators.  During the Cardoso </p><p>administration, then governor of Minas Gerais, Itamar Franco, </p><p>refused to "deverticalize" the Minas Gerais Energy Company </p><p>(Cemig) in defiance of a regulation promulgated by the </p><p>federal energy regulator (Aneel); the regulation was related </p><p>to privatization of the company, which still counted the </p><p>state of Minas Gerais as the majority stake-holder.  The </p><p>company was fined, but the state never capitulated.  The new </p><p>Minister of Mines and Energy has recently expressed her </p><p>opinion that Cemig is not obligated under law to </p><p>deverticalize. </p><p>HRINAK </p><p></p></div>
