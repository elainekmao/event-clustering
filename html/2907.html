<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 000915 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PTER, MCAP, PGOV, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: PRACHANDA DECLARES A CEASEFIRE AFTER ATTACK IN </p><p>ROLPA </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. (A) KATHMANDU 906 </p><p>     B. (B) KATHMANDU 872 </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) An e-mail to evening newspapers purportedly from </p><p>Maoist supremo Prachanda unilaterally declared a one-month </p><p>ceasefire starting June 15.  There has been no official </p><p>reaction yet from the Government of Nepal (GON) to the offer. </p><p> Security forces continue to search for survivors of the May </p><p>7 Maoist atack on a combined Army/Police outpost in Gam, </p><p>Rolpa.  Prachanda\'s announcement, coinciding with the Prime </p><p>Minister\'s highly publicized visit to the U.S., appears to a </p><p>clever, well-calculated ploy to drive a wedge between the GON </p><p>and other political parties before an all-party meeting May </p><p>10.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>CEASEFIRE BY E-MAIL </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) Late May 9 Nepali evening newspapers received an </p><p>e-mail purportedly from Maoist leader Prachanda announcing a </p><p>one-month unilateral ceasefire beginning May 15.  An </p><p>unofficial translation of the e-mail follows below. </p><p> </p><p>Begin text of e-mail: </p><p> </p><p>The killers of brothers, who have attained power through </p><p>tyranny, have now gone begging to the American Imperialists. </p><p>They are committed to crushing the evolving political forum </p><p>by calling foreign military forces into the country.  The </p><p>American Imperialists are openly moving ahead to establish a </p><p>military base in Nepal, as they have done in Afghanistan and </p><p>Central Asia.  This establishment will be used for a </p><p>long-term strategy to surround China and India, and therefore </p><p>America is openly indicating they support these political </p><p>parties.  George Bush has called his adopted son Sher Bahadur </p><p>Deuba to America to instruct him as a Master and to give </p><p>military support.  The American military team that came to </p><p>Nepal has recommended to increase the Royal Nepal Army to </p><p>200,000, establish an air force, and make modern helicopters </p><p>and military equipment available.  This recommendation shows </p><p>that America is trying to fulfill its self-interest by using </p><p>the Gyanendra/Deuba group and is trying to make Nepal like </p><p>Vietnam. </p><p> </p><p>Due to this grand design, the Nepali Army has declared a </p><p>reward on the Maoists\' head.  All other political parties </p><p>being aware of this situation have called on the government </p><p>for poltical dialogue to solve the existing problem.  In this </p><p>regard all those in Parliament and outside should come </p><p>forward to go against the Royal Nepal Army.  If this is the </p><p>situation, we will declare a joint effort to fight against </p><p>these traitors. </p><p> </p><p>Because the 25 of May 2002 is the end of the six months of </p><p>emergency, and because of the requests of our friends to have </p><p>working flexibility and a strategic commitment on our side </p><p>for future political possibilities and our revolutionary </p><p>possibilities, we have declared a ceasefire from our side </p><p>from 15th May 2002 for the period of one month.  If during </p><p>this period there is suppression on all grounds and </p><p>anti-national activities are conducted, we will launch a </p><p>massive war. </p><p> </p><p>Prachanda </p><p>Chairman </p><p>NCP (Maoist) </p><p>8th May 2002 </p><p>End text. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  As of COB May 9, the Government of Nepal (GON) had </p><p>no official reaction to the statement.  The Public Affairs </p><p>Officer for the Royal Nepal Army (RNA) said he had not yet </p><p>even seen the e-mail--although he had heard about it--but </p><p>volunteered his own unofficial opinion that the offer was not </p><p>sincere and the GON would not be taken in by it.  The RNA has </p><p>the Maoists on the run, he posited; the insurgents are </p><p>wearing out.  They would only use the ceasefire as a </p><p>"respite" to regroup and consolidate their depleted strength. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  Prachanda\'s offer follows closely on a May 1 </p><p>announcement that the Maoists would welcome dialogue (Ref B) </p><p>and falls just the day before an all-party mass meeting and </p><p>rally in the capital May 10.  Organizers are expecting a </p><p>large turnout for the rally, which will focus on calls for an </p><p>end to violence.  Student wings of the various parties plan </p><p>to hold a peace march to coincide with the rally.  The </p><p>all-party meeting was expected to take up for consideration </p><p>Prachanda\'s call for dialogue, among other matters.  The </p><p>meeting, like Prachanda\'s annoucement, coincides with the </p><p>high-profile visit of Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba to </p><p>the U.S.-- a visit that has generated substantial and often </p><p>erroneous or unrealistic speculation regarding possible U.S. </p><p>military assistance to the GON to defeat the insurgents. </p><p>Before leaving, Deuba had publicly rejected dialogue without </p><p>an accompanying agreement from the Maoists to lay down their </p><p>arms. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>GRIM NEWS FROM GAM </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  Information from Gam, Rolpa, where the Maoists </p><p>launched an attack on a combined police and Army outpost May </p><p>7 (Ref A), continues to be spotty.  According to the latest </p><p>accounts, a total of 123 security personnel (53 RNA, 40 </p><p>regular police, 30 Armed Police Force) were at the outpost in </p><p>Gam at the time of the attack.  After the attack, 35 badly </p><p>burned bodies have been found.  Because of the bodies\' </p><p>condition, the authorities have been unable to determine if </p><p>they are Maoists, security forces or villagers.  Twelve </p><p>wounded RNA, one policeman, and five Armed Police have been </p><p>evacuated to hospitals, and five other RNA and six regular </p><p>police survived the attack.  The rest remain unaccounted for. </p><p> Police sources say that no villagers have been found in Gam. </p><p> Whether the residents were killed, abducted, or fled remains </p><p>unknown. </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) Prachanda could not have picked a more opportune </p><p>time to send out peace signals.  The offer comes just as </p><p>Deuba is visiting Washington and London to ask for assistance </p><p>to defeat the Maoists, and just as many of his political </p><p>opponents--including some in his own party--have called a </p><p>mass meeting on finding a peaceful resolution to the </p><p>conflict.  Deuba has already rejected Prachanda\'s first </p><p>overture.  Rejecting the second one will put the PM in the </p><p>difficult position of seeming to turn down a chance at peace, </p><p>and can only give his domestic critics--and often </p><p>self-serving political rivals--more reason to find fault. </p><p>But bitter experience with the Maoists\' perfidy in the first </p><p>ceasefire and accompanying negotiations, during which the </p><p>Maoists rearmed and regrouped, has taught Deuba and the </p><p>security forces not to trust their professions of peace.  We </p><p>do not expect the GON to reciprocate the Maoists\' (likely </p><p>spurious) offer. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
