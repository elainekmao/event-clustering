<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 000678 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF, AF/S, AF/PD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAO, ZI, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT:  Zimbabwean Media and Public Opinion on War in </p><p>Iraq </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED.  NOT FOR INTERNET POSTING. </p><p> </p><p>  1.   (SBU) Summary:  In spite of efforts by both </p><p>     government-owned and privately owned media to spin war </p><p>     news for local political purposes, the conflict in Iraq </p><p>     remains a distant concern for the great majority of </p><p>     Zimbabweans.  Public opinion is quietly anti-war and </p><p>     tends to reflect public opinion toward the Government </p><p>     of Zimbabwe:  Government supporters oppose the war, and </p><p>     critics of the government, while not gung-ho supporters </p><p>     of the Coalition, show some sympathy for the need to </p><p>     depose Saddam Hussein.  The Government of Zimbabwe </p><p>     (GOZ) has expressed strong opposition to the war and </p><p>     argues that U.S. actions in Iraq represent a threat to </p><p>     Zimbabwe and the world.  Popular opinion is not greatly </p><p>     influenced by GOZ attempts to portray the war as a </p><p>     threat to Zimbabwe.  On the street, there is no sign of </p><p>     the war other than newspaper headlines.  There have </p><p>     been no demonstrations or graffiti related to the war, </p><p>     and the war does not dominate our casual, day-to-day </p><p>     contact with Zimbabweans.  For most Zimbabweans, the </p><p>     war in Iraq is so far removed from their daily lives </p><p>     that they treat it more like a movie or the latest TV </p><p>     "reality" show than a serious geo-political conflict. </p><p>     End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  --------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>  ---------------------- </p><p>  Zimbabwean Media "Spin" War News in Different </p><p>  Directions </p><p>  --------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>  ---------------------- </p><p>  2.   (SBU) Both sides of Zimbabwe\'s polarized media are </p><p>     seeking to use the war in Iraq to advance political </p><p>     messages.  Government-owned media get top honors, </p><p>     though, for both quantity and shrillness of their </p><p>     messages.  Government-owned dailies "The Herald" and </p><p>     "The Chronicle" offer readers a mixture of sensational </p><p>     headlines over reasonably straightforward wire service </p><p>     (primarily AFP and Reuters) stories, and staunchly anti- </p><p>     US opinion pieces from obscure left-wing news services </p><p>     and local pundits. </p><p> </p><p>  3.   (U) The front page of the April 2 "Herald" </p><p>     illustrates GOZ attitudes toward the war and the way </p><p>     government editors manipulate the news.  A reasonably </p><p>     responsible AFP report on the tragedy of Iraqi </p><p>     civilians killed when their vehicle failed to stop at a </p><p>     roadblock was reprinted under an above-the-fold, blood- </p><p>     red banner that read "US Massacres 48 - Victims include </p><p>     women, children."  The op-ed spread in the same edition </p><p>     gave a full page to two stories:  "US Lies Exposed" and </p><p>     "US, UK Conflict Over Spoils of War."  These stories </p><p>     came from an international Trotskyite organization. </p><p> </p><p>  4.   (U) All free-to-air broadcast media in Zimbabwe is </p><p>     owned and tightly controlled by the GOZ.  As a result, </p><p>     average Zimbabweans receive a steady diet of distinctly </p><p>     anti-American radio and television reports and news </p><p>     "analysis."  Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation (ZBC) </p><p>     television news focuses on Iraqi civilian casualties, </p><p>     and tends to feature video loops alternating between </p><p>     Iraqi government officials in press conferences and </p><p>     images of wounded Iraqi children.  ZBC also produces a </p><p>     nightly discussion program on Iraq, called "U.S.-UK </p><p>     Invasion of Iraq," that invites mostly anti-American </p><p>     Zimbabweans to discuss the war. </p><p> </p><p>  5.   (SBU) The purpose of government media spin is </p><p>     clear:  Show the US to be an uncaring, neo-colonialist </p><p>     hegemon and show the Iraqis to be courageous, </p><p>     principled victims.   This spin complements the GOZ\'s </p><p>     campaign to cast itself as a courageous and principled </p><p>     government standing up to an uncaring neo-colonialist </p><p>     hegemon.  Government media have not dedicated any time </p><p>     or space to examining Saddam Hussein\'s history or style </p><p>     of government.  The GOZ and its media have long made </p><p>     use of external enemies to deflect public attention </p><p>     from the real causes of Zimbabwe\'s problems. </p><p>     Traditionally, the UK has been the primary target of </p><p>     these campaigns.  The war in Iraq, however, has given </p><p>     the GOZ an opportunity to cast the U.S. as the most </p><p>     dangerous enemy, so we have temporarily replaced the </p><p>     British in GOZ propaganda efforts. </p><p> </p><p>  6.   (U) Privately owned media provide more responsible </p><p>     coverage of the war, but are also trying to spin events </p><p>     in Iraq to support their political agendas.  War </p><p>     coverage, mostly straight from Reuters and AP, is </p><p>     published in inside pages.  Headlines are </p><p>     dispassionate.  Op-ed writers, though, have seized on </p><p>     the principle that dictators face serious consequences. </p><p>     A few have suggested that the world should turn its </p><p>     attention to Zimbabwe once Saddam Hussein has been </p><p>     removed from power.  The privately owned media have </p><p>     published news stories and op-ed pieces that raise the </p><p>     issues of Saddam Hussein\'s human rights record, use of </p><p>     WMD, and attacks against neighboring countries. </p><p>     Overall, Zimbabwe\'s private media provide generally </p><p>     balanced news reporting while using the example of </p><p>     Saddam Hussein to highlight Zimbabwe\'s own problems </p><p>     with autocratic leadership </p><p> </p><p>     --------------------------------------- </p><p>     Iraq Debate is a Luxury for Most </p><p>     --------------------------------------- </p><p>  7.   (SBU) While countervailing government and private </p><p>     media spin may provide some diversion for Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>     elite, the war is of little consequence to the great </p><p>     majority of Zimbabweans.  Most Zimbabweans feel no </p><p>     particular connection to Iraq, are not Muslim, and are </p><p>     fully occupied with the day-to-day pressures of making </p><p>     ends meet in Zimbabwe\'s dysfunctional economy and </p><p>     highly charged political environment.  There have been </p><p>     no anti-US or pro-Iraq demonstrations in Zimbabwe, nor </p><p>     any apparent rejection of the American cultural symbols </p><p>     (food outlets, clothing styles, music) among young </p><p>     Zimbabweans.  Embassy officers and their families have </p><p>     encountered almost no Iraq-related hostility from </p><p>     Zimbabweans. </p><p> </p><p>  8.   (U) Among the elite (generally people with access </p><p>     to international news sources), attitude toward the war </p><p>     in Iraq correlates positively to attitude toward the </p><p>     government of Robert Mugabe.  The more strongly an </p><p>     individual supports Mugabe, the more likely it is he or </p><p>     she will oppose the war against Saddam Hussein.  Among </p><p>     these people, the prevalent perceptions are that the </p><p>     war is for control of Iraqi oil, that the U.S. is again </p><p>     demonstrating its "cowboy" or "global cop" approach to </p><p>     the world, and that the death of Iraqi civilians proves </p><p>     that America is amoral and relieves the U.S. of any </p><p>     right to complain about human rights in Zimbabwe.  The </p><p>     elite who favor reform in Zimbabwe tend to see the war </p><p>     in Iraq in more nuanced terms.  Only a few strongly </p><p>     support the war.  These few are the same people who </p><p>     would like to see coalition military forces drive </p><p>     straight from Baghdad to Harare.  Most reform-minded </p><p>     elite Zimbabweans appreciate the dimensions of Saddam </p><p>     Hussein\'s crimes and are sympathetic to the imperative </p><p>     of deposing him.  Many of them, however, are not </p><p>     persuaded that the U.S. was right to act without full </p><p>     UN backing and believe that we should have given </p><p>     diplomacy more time.  Many of these people are also </p><p>     concerned that U.S. action has damaged the UN and that </p><p>     the long-term result of the war will be to create many </p><p>     more fanatics determined to attack the U.S. </p><p> </p><p>  ----------------- </p><p>  Action Show? </p><p>   --------------- </p><p>  9.   (SBU) Perhaps the most telling illustration of </p><p>     Zimbabwean popular attitude toward the war is the way </p><p>     audiences react to war video.  The Embassy\'s public </p><p>     affairs section is standing-room only each day when it </p><p>     shows international television news of the war.  On </p><p>     occasion, the almost exclusively male audience will </p><p>     break into cheers and applause for some telegenic bit </p><p>     of violence (e.g., a burning tank, or an especially </p><p>     large explosion).  The Zimbabwean audience doesn\'t seem </p><p>     to care whether the violence is against Coalition or </p><p>     Iraqi forces - they just enjoy the spectacle.  The </p><p>     conclusion we draw from this is that, for most </p><p>     Zimbabweans, the war is simply not real; it is so </p><p>     remote that audiences relate to it the way they might </p><p>     relate to an action movie.  They may identify more </p><p>     closely with the Iraqis than the Americans, but it is </p><p>     not a passionate identification.  In the end, we </p><p>     suspect that many Zimbabweans will want to identify </p><p>     with the winners and that long-term resentment of U.S. </p><p>     action in Iraq will be limited to the pro-government </p><p>     elite. </p><p> </p><p>  SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
