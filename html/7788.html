<p>UNCLAS ABUJA 000813 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: CASC, ASEC, EPET, ENRG, ECON, PINS, PGOV, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: AGREEMENT REACHED ON OIL RIG HOSTAGE </p><p>CRISIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ABUJA 810 </p><p>     B. ABUJA 807 </p><p>     C. ABUJA 806 </p><p>     D. ABUJA 768 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. National Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers </p><p>(NUPENG) local and national leadership on May 3 agreed </p><p>unconditionally that all 273 hostages and 99 striking workers </p><p>on board the four Transocean Forex Sedco rigs near Port </p><p>Harcourt would be allowed to disembark. The Settlement was </p><p>negotiated by Nigeria Labor Congress (NLC) President Adams </p><p>Oshiomhole, who was the real hero in this crisis. Oshiomole </p><p>said the local NUPENG leadership had been in communication </p><p>with the striking workers on the rig, and they had agreed to </p><p>comply. Managing Director of Transocean Sedco Forex Ian </p><p>Clark, who did not participate in the negotiations but was </p><p>allowed to state his company\'s position as the session </p><p>opened, also confirmed to the Ambassador on May 3 that an </p><p>agreement had been reached and all persons on board the rigs </p><p>would be offloaded by ship and helicopter over the next few </p><p>days. Some would disembark this evening, but it would </p><p>probably be Sunday before all were on land, Clark added. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. In informing the Ambassador about the agreement, </p><p>Oshiomhole emphasized that the company made no concessions in </p><p>the negotiations and that in coming days, talks between the </p><p>company and NUPENG and NLC representatives might occur at a </p><p>place of the company\'s choosing. Oshiomhole further stressed </p><p>that making concessions would have set a bad precedent for </p><p>industrial relations in the country and insisted that had </p><p>there been concessions, other workers would seek to use </p><p>similar tactics in the future. Clark, meanwhile, said that </p><p>the priority now was to get people off the rigs and that the </p><p>striking workers would be dealt with next week. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. Clark said that he was enormously appreciative of Embassy </p><p>efforts in helping to resolve the crisis. In particular, he </p><p>was grateful for our efforts to involve President Obasanjo as </p><p>well as NLC President Oshiomhole whose efforts he said were </p><p>key to resolution of the crisis. Comment: We will continue to </p><p>monitor the situation over the weekend to ensure that the </p><p>agreement is actually implemented. End Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. The following is the text of the agreement: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(Begin Text) </p><p>COMMUNIQUE OF MEETING BETWEEN THE </p><p>MANAGEMENT OF TRANS OCEAN, NUPENG AND </p><p>PENGASSAN BROKERED BY THE </p><p>NIGERIA LABOUR CONGRESS ON </p><p>2ND OF MAY 2003 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Following the intervention of the Nigeria Labour Congress </p><p>(NLC) and under its auspices, the management of Trans Ocean, </p><p>the national secretariats and local chapter of NUPENG and </p><p>PENGASSAN met over the ongoing industrial action on some of </p><p>the operational sites of the company. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It was agreed by all parties that the industrial action be </p><p>suspended immediately and the rigs be vacated forthwith to </p><p>pave way for the restoration of normalcy in their operations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The meeting also agreed that the national leadership of the </p><p>NLC, NUPENG and PENGASSAN would further assist the parties to </p><p>immediately evolve a framework of dialogue to deal with the </p><p>concerns of the management and the workers in a mutually </p><p>acceptable manner. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Management of Trans Ocean and the unions expressed </p><p>appreciation for the intervention of the NLC. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Signed: </p><p>Adams Aliyu Oshiomhole, President, NLC </p><p>Ian Clark, Managing Director, Trans Ocean </p><p>Peter Akpatason, President, NUPENG </p><p>L.B.
