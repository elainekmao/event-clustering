<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 OTTAWA 000789 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR WHA/CAN, EB/TRA </p><p> </p><p>WHITE HOUSE FOR Homeland Security Council AND NSC </p><p> </p><p>Department of HOMELAND SECURITY FOR Kinney and Schreiber </p><p>Hughes </p><p> </p><p>STATE PASS USTR FOR JOHN MELLE </p><p> </p><p>USDOT FOR JEFF SHANE, SUSAN MCDERMOTT </p><p> </p><p>DHHS, Office of the Secretary, BILL STEIGER </p><p> </p><p>USDOC FOR 4320/OFFICE OF NAFTA; 3134/OIO/WESTERN HEMISPHERE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, ELTN, ASEC, EINV, PREL, CA </p><p>SUBJECT: Border Facts and Economic Impact </p><p> </p><p>REF:  (A) 02 Toronto 2657 (notal) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. The Canadian-U.S. border is a key life-line in the </p><p>functioning of a large part of our economy.  The economic </p><p>relationship between Canada and the United States is </p><p>unparalleled.  It is the largest merchandise trade </p><p>relationship in the world with over US$1.1 Billion in goods </p><p>crossing the border every day, with Canada enjoying a </p><p>surplus.  Any heightened security effort along the border </p><p>should take into account how to minimize economic disruption </p><p>to our economy, for instance, by ensuring that FAST, CT-PAT, </p><p>NEXUS and other secure, facilitative systems operate </p><p>efficiently.  Private sector groups that depend on trade </p><p>across the border, such as the automobile industry, have </p><p>asked for guidance on what to expect if the U.S. moves to a </p><p>code "red" terrorism threat level.  The Embassy strongly </p><p>suggests as full coordination as possible among federal, </p><p>state, provincial and municipal authorities, as well as key </p><p>industrial sectors.  U.S. and Canadian industry agree: their </p><p>operations can be modified if necessary to accommodate </p><p>security concerns - it is unexpected actions of undetermined </p><p>duration that causes the most havoc in trade flows, not </p><p>increased security measures by themselves.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>American and Canadian Economic Security Intertwined </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>2. The stakes are large: Thirty-five American states have </p><p>Canada as their leading export market. Total two-way trade </p><p>in goods between the US and Canada is larger than total US </p><p>merchandise trade with the entire 15-country European Union. </p><p>In 2001, merchandise trade between the two countries was </p><p>US$383 billion, translating into over US$1.1 billion in </p><p>goods crossing the border every day. </p><p> </p><p>3. The US traded US$223 billion in goods with the province </p><p>of Ontario alone in 2001 - only US$11 billion less than </p><p>total goods trade with Mexico.   Michigan alone conducted </p><p>US$62 billion of trade in 2001 with Canada.  Twenty three </p><p>percent of all US merchandise exports go to Canada.  The </p><p>bottom-line is Canada is our largest market, accounting for </p><p>three percent of US GDP, and we are Canada\'s largest market, </p><p>accounting for over 30 percent of its GDP. </p><p> </p><p>4. About 65% of this trade (by value) in goods is </p><p>transported across the border by truck, 16% by rail, 9% by </p><p>pipeline, 8% by air and 2% by marine.  The border </p><p>infrastructure can be a massive bottleneck.  Three border </p><p>crossings, the Windsor ON -Detroit MI Ambassador Bridge, the </p><p>Fort Erie ON - Buffalo NY bridge, and the Sarnia ON - Port </p><p>Huron MI bridge account for approximately US$160 billion </p><p>annually, or nearly 65% of the value of all the truck-borne </p><p>commerce between the two countries. Below are some examples </p><p>of trade interdependencies in key sectors. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>Automotive Manufacturing & Just-in-time delivery </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>5. The massive North American automotive manufacturing </p><p>sector is unalterably integrated across the Canada-U.S. </p><p>border.  Michigan and Ontario\'s automotive industries are co- </p><p>dependent, exchanging close to US$47 billion worth of </p><p>automobiles, trucks, and auto parts in 2001.  A key feature </p><p>of this integration is "just-in-time" delivery and inventory </p><p>management (Ref A).  In practice this means that assembly </p><p>plants do not have warehouses, but rely on the hourly </p><p>arrival of deliveries, the majority of which are intra- </p><p>company transfers.  Significant border delays wreak havoc on </p><p>this finely-tuned system.  In the case of 9-11 and </p><p>subsequent days in 2001, because of border closures, some </p><p>assembly lines shut down for hours, and a few plants shut- </p><p>down for a day or longer - albeit the border closure also </p><p>coincided with an existing slump in the auto industry.  The </p><p>auto industry has told us they fully support all necessary </p><p>security measures, but they also strongly urge us to </p><p>remember that the more information we can provide them, the </p><p>easier than can adjust their methods to changed </p><p>circumstances. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>Produce, Fish, Meat and Livestock </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>6. US exporters are the dominant suppliers of Canadian </p><p>agricultural imports, accounting for nearly two-thirds of </p><p>the total, while Canadian exporters ship more than half of </p><p>their agricultural exports to the United States.  Canadian </p><p>exports of perishable food items, namely fresh and frozen </p><p>meats, fruits and vegetables are vulnerable to spoilage and </p><p>deterioration under lengthy border delays.  Major delays can </p><p>also severely affect the health of livestock in transit. </p><p>About 7.0 million live cattle and hogs are exported to the </p><p>United States annually. Almost 2.5 million of these are </p><p>destined for U.S. processing plants whose operations are </p><p>heavily dependent on the timely availability of Canadian </p><p>animals. According to the Ontario Food Terminal, Canada\'s </p><p>largest produce terminal, virtually all U.S. exports of </p><p>fresh produce to Canada are by truck. Rather than return to </p><p>the United States empty, the trucks commonly return with </p><p>backhaul. In fact, their original departure from U.S. points </p><p>is often dependent upon timely backhaul arrangements. </p><p>Canada exports about US$1.8 billion worth (FDA estimated </p><p>retail value in 2001) of fresh and frozen seafood to the </p><p>United States.  The major metropolitan markets of the </p><p>eastern seaboard are particularly conspicuous consumers of </p><p>Canadian products and delays of only a few hours </p><p>significantly diminish the quality and marketability of </p><p>fresh/live seafood. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>Critical Medical Products </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. Disruption to the timely and reliable supply of essential </p><p>medical isotopes from Canada to the United States could </p><p>result in the cancellation of some of the approximately </p><p>36,000 medical diagnostic procedures conducted daily or in </p><p>the cancellation of treatments for cancer.  An Ottawa-based </p><p>company, MDS Nordion, is America\'s largest supplier of </p><p>medical isotopes, highly time-sensitive products.  This </p><p>company\'s products include molybdenum-99, an isotope for </p><p>diagnosis used in about 80% of nuclear medicine procedures, </p><p>and "radio-iodine" (iodine-131) used for diagnosing and </p><p>treating thyroid conditions including cancer.  Due to their </p><p>short radioactive half-lives, any delay in transporting </p><p>these isotopes, even if it is for a few hours, can have a </p><p>serious impact on their reliability for diagnostic and </p><p>therapeutic purposes. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>Critical Professionals: Health care workers </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. Many Canadian nurses work at hospitals in Detroit and </p><p>live in Windsor Ontario.  In the wake of 9-11, Detroit </p><p>hospitals suffered due to border delays that prevented staff </p><p>from making it to work.  To continue to function, hospitals </p><p>in the U.S. took special steps to arrange transportation for </p><p>staff coming from Canada. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>Concern About "Threat Level Red" </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. Industry and transportation associations on both sides of </p><p>the border have expressed concern about possible confusion </p><p>and resultant border delays if the U.S. moves to Threat </p><p>Level Condition Red.  Representatives of the automobile </p><p>manufacturers, among others, have asked for specific </p><p>information about what they could expect under threat level </p><p>red.  Lacking other information, the American Trucking </p><p>Association has posted its own interpretation of what </p><p>truckers can expect to encounter. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>10. We recognize that specific information about what to </p><p>expect under various threat scenarios is difficult to </p><p>provide.  Speculation aside, these days of heightened </p><p>tension seem a good time to point out that it is in the </p><p>interest of ourselves and the Canadians to maintain travel </p><p>and trade across the border, consistent with security needs. </p><p>There is no question on either side that the border should </p><p>remain open for legitimate purposes, but closed to </p><p>terrorists.  A major motivation for business and other </p><p>frequent users to enroll in FAST, CT-PAT and NEXUS has been </p><p>to support this goal by simplifying border use while </p><p>enhancing security.  We have worked for more than a year and </p><p>a half through the Smart Border Action Plan to make the </p><p>border smart and secure.  Our challenge is to maintain this </p><p>in the high threat environment that lies ahead. </p><p> </p><p>Kelly </p><p></p></div>
