<p>UNCLAS AMMAN 001653 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARN, NEA/PA, NEA/AIA, INR/NESA, R/MR, </p><p>I/GNEA, B/BXN, B/BRN, NEA/PPD, NEA/IPA FOR ALTERMAN </p><p>USAID/ANE/MEA </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH </p><p>PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p> </p><p>TAGS: KMDR JO </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON IRAQ AND MIDDLE EAST </p><p> </p><p>                        Summary </p><p> </p><p>-- The lead story in all papers today, March 18, </p><p>focuses on President Bush\'s address to the American </p><p>people yesterday and the 48-hour ultimatum for Saddam </p><p>to "leave or face war".  A number of editorial </p><p>commentaries focus on the killing of U.S. peace </p><p>activist, Rachel Corey, crushed by an Israeli </p><p>bulldozer. </p><p> </p><p>                 Editorial Commentary </p><p> </p><p>-- "War it is" </p><p> </p><p>Center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(03/18) editorializes:  "Washington and London have </p><p>justified their political and military attack on Iraq </p><p>by claiming that the Iraqi regime has violated the </p><p>will of the international community.  When Iraq did </p><p>the bidding of the international community and the </p><p>international community rejected war, the two allies </p><p>retracted their claims and instead talked about the </p><p>post-war era, claiming that a war on Iraq would be in </p><p>the best interest of Iraq and the world.  It is as if </p><p>this region is destined to suffer from `double </p><p>standards\', and then pay the price of the `reversed </p><p>standards\' that Washington brought forth..  War it is, </p><p>then, which will pour oil on an already raging fire of </p><p>anger, frustration and desperation in the region." </p><p> </p><p>-- "So the war may pass" </p><p> </p><p>Columnist Ibrahim Absi writes on the op-ed page of </p><p>center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(03/18):  "After losing hope of realizing a new </p><p>Security Council resolution that would unleash his </p><p>killing in Iraq, the American President resorted to </p><p>playing the Palestinian card, to hide behind it and to </p><p>portray his administration, which is so preoccupied </p><p>with preparations for war, as being interested in </p><p>resolving the Palestinian cause and establishing a </p><p>Palestinian state.  It is a not so innocent attempt on </p><p>his part to combine war and peace on one level, the </p><p>Arab level, to convince the Arabs of the need to be </p><p>quiet while Iraq is being slaughtered in return for </p><p>establishing the promised Palestinian state.  This is </p><p>not the first time that the Palestinian card was </p><p>played by the Americans to hide their shortcomings." </p><p> </p><p>-- "A crazy moment" </p><p> </p><p>Chief Editor Taher Udwan writes on the back-page of </p><p>independent, mass-appeal Arabic daily Al-Arab Al-Yawm </p><p>(03/18):  "The people of this region and the world </p><p>view Bush\'s war as an inescapable plague.  The ironic </p><p>issue here is that the American President wants to </p><p>make `the implementation of Security Council </p><p>resolutions\' on Iraq the moral and ethical basis for </p><p>his imminent war.  Bush\'s war may achieve its military </p><p>purpose.  However, as of today, this war is going to </p><p>be a colonialist war, a war of occupation, and a war </p><p>of arrogant force against law and international </p><p>legitimacy.  This is going to make `the American </p><p>occupation\' and not `the American globalization\' the </p><p>state that marks the relationship between the Arab and </p><p>Muslim people and America.  And this is a state of </p><p>conflict." </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
