REASONS 1.5 (B) AND </p><p>(D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: ZANU-PF DEPUTY MINISTER (ENVIRONMENT AND </p><p>TOURISM) AND MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT EDWARD CHINDORI- </p><p>CHININGA PAID A CALL ON AMBASSADOR MCDONALD ON OCTOBER </p><p>30 TO UPDATE HIM ON HIS MINISTRY\'S LATEST ACTIVITIES. </p><p>CHINDORI-CHININGA, WHO IS PART OF THE YOUNGER GENERATION </p><p>OF ZANU-PF POLITICIANS, SHARED HIS INSIDER VIEWS ON THE </p><p>MUGABE SUCCESSION ISSUE WITH THE AMBASSADOR.  HE STATED </p><p>THAT THERE ARE CURRENTLY TWO SIDES TO THE QUESTION OF </p><p>MUGABE\'S ROLE IN ZANU-PF.  ONE SIDE SAYS THE PRESIDENT </p><p>MUST RETIRE.  ZANU-PF WILL AMEND THE PARTY CONSTITUTION </p><p>TO ALLOW MUGABE TO REMAIN AS HEAD OF PARTY, BUT THAT A </p><p>NEW CANDIDATE WILL BE FOUND TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT OF </p><p>ZIMBABWE IN 2002.  THE OTHER SIDE SAYS THAT IT IS </p><p>ALREADY TOO LATE TO FIND A NEW CANDIDATE WITH NATIONAL </p><p>STATURE TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT OF ZIMBABWE IN 2002, SO </p><p>MUGABE WILL HAVE TO BE THE PARTY\'S CANDIDATE.  ACCORDING </p><p>TO THE DEPUTY MINISTER, THE SIDES ARE NOT DIVIDED ALONG </p><p>GENERATIONAL LINES, BUT RATHER BASED ON THEIR VIEW OF </p><p>HOW ZANU-PF CAN MAINTAIN CONTROL OF THE PRESIDENCY.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>ZANU-PF: A PARTY DIVIDED </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  06120  01 OF 02  311118Z </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) AMBASSADOR MCDONALD TOOK ADVANTAGE OF HIS MEETING </p><p>WITH CHINDORI-CHININGA, WHICH WAS INITIATED BY THE </p><p>DEPUTY MINISTER TO DISCUSS HIS MINSTRY\'S ACTIVITIES </p><p>(REPORTED IN SEPTEL), TO ASK HIM HIS VIEW OF EVENTS </p><p>WITHIN ZANU-PF, AND IN PARTICULAR THE QUESTION OF WHAT </p><p>WAS THE INTERNAL DEBATE WITHIN THE PARTY REGARDING THE </p><p>QUESTION OF MUGABE\'S FUTURE.  THE DEPUTY MINISTER IS ONE </p><p>OF THE GROUP OF NEW YOUNGER MPS OF ZANU-PF WHO ARE </p><p>FORWARD THINKING AND PROFESSIONAL IN THEIR OUTLOOK, AND </p><p>WILLING TO EXPOUND ON THIS ISSUE.  WHILE NOT TIPPING HIS </p><p>HAND, CHINDORI-CHININGA REVEALED THAT THERE ARE TWO </p><p>SIDES WITHIN ZANU-PF REGARDING THE ISSUE OF MUGABE AND </p><p>HIS POSSIBLE CANDIDACY FOR THE 2002 PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>ELECTION.  THE TWO SIDES ARE NOT BASED ON A GENERATIONAL </p><p>DIVIDE WITHIN THE PARTY, AS WE EXPECTED TO HEAR, BUT </p><p>RATHER APPEARED TO BE BASED ON ZANU-PF POLITICIANS\' </p><p>VIEWS AS TO WHAT CANDIDATE WOULD MORE LIKELY ENSURE THAT </p><p>THE PARTY RETAINS CONTROL OF THE PRESIDENCY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>ONE SIDE: A GRACEFUL RETIREMENT FOR MUGABE </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) ONE SIDE OF THIS ISSUE BELIEVES THAT IT IS TIME </p><p>FOR MUGABE TO RETIRE AND THAT HE SHOULD NOT BE THE </p><p>PARTY\'S CANDIDATE FOR THE 2002 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS. </p><p>IN ORDER TO PROVIDE FOR A FACE SAVING EXIT FOR MUGABE </p><p>THEY WOULD HAVE HIM STAY ON AS ZANU-PF\'S PRESIDENT, BUT </p><p>THE PARTY WOULD PRESENT A NEW CANDIDATE FOR THE 2002 </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  06120  01 OF 02  311118Z </p><p>ZIMBABWE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS.  THIS PLAN WOULD </p><p>REQUIRE A CHANGE IN THE ZANU-PF PARTY CONSTITUTION SINCE </p><p>IT PRESENTLY STATES THAT THE PARTY\'S PRESIDENT WILL BE </p><p>THE PARTY\'S CANDIDATE FOR THE NATION\'S PRESIDENCY. </p><p>CHINDORI-CHININGA DID NOT APPEAR TO BELIEVE THAT IT </p><p>WOULD BE THAT DIFFICULT TO GET THE SUPPORT TO CHANGE THE </p><p>PARTY\'S CONSTITUTION IN THIS MANNER.  THIS PLAN WOULD </p><p>ALLOW MUGABE TO REMAIN AN ELDER STATESMAN OF PARTY </p><p>POLITICS, WHILE ALLOWING A NEW CANDIDATE WITH GREATER </p><p>APPEAL, AND WITHOUT THE NEGATIVE BAGGAGE OF MUGABE, TO </p><p>REPRESENT ZANU-PF IN THE 2002 ELECTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>THE OTHER SIDE: TOO LATE TO CHANGE </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DEBATE IN ZANU-PF BELIEVES </p><p>THAT IT IS TOO LATE TO DUMP MUGABE AS THE PARTY </p><p>CANDIDATE FOR THE 2002 ELECTIONS.  THIS GROUP BELIEVES </p><p>THAT NO ONE IN THE PARTY HAS THE NATIONAL NAME </p><p>RECOGNITION OF MUGABE OR THE SUPPORT OF THE DIVERSE </p><p>ELEMENTS WITHIN THE PARTY STRUCTURE.  THEREFORE, WHAT IS </p><p>NEEDED IS FOR THE PARTY TO CLOSE RANKS AND SUPPORT </p><p>MUGABE AGGRESSIVELY AS THE PARTY\'S CANDIDATE FOR 2002. </p><p>THE AMBASSADOR ASKED CHINDORI-CHININGA HOW HE THOUGHT </p><p>THIS SIDE OF THE PARTY COULD BELIEVE THAT MUGABE WOULD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ4569 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  06120  02 OF 02  311119Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DINT-00  DODE-00 </p><p>      DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EUR-00   FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00 </p><p>      H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01 </p><p>      NSAE-00  OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00 </p><p>      P-00     SP-00    IRM-00   STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00 </p><p>      DSCC-00  DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /007W </p><p>                  ------------------98CAFD  311136Z /38 </p><p>P 311116Z OCT 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 7482 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 006120 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p>PASS USAID FOR AFR/SD - DWELLER, AND AFR/SA - CPALMA, </p><p>NNEWMAN </p><p> </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>PASS USTR - ROSA WHITAKER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  06120  02 OF 02  311119Z </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/31/10 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: A ZANU-PF DEPUTY MINISTER AND MP\'S INSIDER VIEW </p><p>ON THE MUGABE SUCCESSION ISSUE </p><p> </p><p>BE THEIR BEST CANDIDATE WHEN RECENT POLLS INDICATED THAT </p><p>THE PROBABLE MDC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE MORGAN </p><p>TSVANGIRAI WOULD TROUNCE MUGABE IN FREE AND FAIR </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>ELECTIONS.  THE DEPUTY MINISTER JUST SHRUGGED HIS </p><p>SHOULDERS IN RESPONSE. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>IDENTIFYING AN ALTERNATIVE TO MUGABE </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) THE EASE-MUGABE-OUT FACTION WOULD IDENTIFY A NEW </p><p>CANDIDATE FOR THE PARTY FOR 2002 BY TURNING TO THE </p><p>PROVINCIAL PARTY STRUCTURES AND ASKING THEM TO EACH </p><p>SUBMIT A LIST OF WHO THEY WOULD SUPPORT AS A NEW </p><p>CANDIDATE.  THE PARTY LEADERSHIP WOULD THEN CROSSCHECK </p><p>THESE LISTS, AND IDENTIFY THE NAME THAT APPEARED ON THE </p><p>MOST PROVINCIAL LISTS.  THIS WOULD THEN BE THE PARTY\'S </p><p>CANDIDATE.  THIS CANDIDATE\'S BROAD PARTY AND NATIONAL </p><p>SUPPORT WOULD BE EVIDENCED BY THE FACT THAT HIS NAME </p><p>APPEARED ON THE MAJORITY OF PROVINCIAL PARTY LISTS. </p><p>WHEN CHINDORI-CHININGA WAS ASKED WHETHER ZANU-PF WAS </p><p>CONSIDERING HAVING A PARTY PRIMARY TO DETERMINE THE </p><p>PARTY\'S CANDIDATE FOR 2002, AS THEY HAD FOR </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY SEATS IN THE 2000 ELECTIONS, HE DIDN\'T </p><p>HESITATE IN STATING NO. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  06120  02 OF 02  311119Z </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>AMBASSADOR MCDONALD URGES CONFIDENCE BUILDING </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) AMBASSADOR MCDONALD TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY OF THE </p><p>MEETING WITH THIS YOUNGER UP-AND-COMING MEMBER OF ZANU- </p><p>PF TO EXPRESS THE U.S. CONCERN WITH POLITICAL </p><p>DEVELOPMENTS IN ZIMBABWE AND TO STATE THAT NOW WAS THE </p><p>TIME FOR ZANU-PF MPS AND MDC MPS TO WORK TOGETHER ON </p><p>ISSUES OF COMMON NATIONAL INTEREST IN PARLIAMENT IN </p><p>ORDER TO INCREASE DIALOGUE AND DECREASE TENSIONS.  THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR POINTED OUT THAT THE SITUATION IN ZIMBABWE </p><p>WAS EVEN MORE TENSE AFTER THE RECENT FOOD RIOTS, AND </p><p>THAT THIS WAS THE IMAGE THAT THE WORLD WAS GETTING OF </p><p>ZIMBABWE, A NATION DESCENDING INTO CHAOS AND VIOLENCE. </p><p>THE DEPUTY MINISTER STATED THAT HE SHARED THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR\'S CONCERN AND THAT HE AND OTHER ZANU-PF MPS </p><p>WERE TRYING TO BUILD BRIDGES TO MPS OF THE MDC, BOTH </p><p>WITHIN THE PARLIAMENTARY SETTING, AND IN OTHER SETTINGS. </p><p>THE AMBASSADOR POINTED OUT TO CHINDORI-CHININGA THAT THE </p><p>PORTFOLIO OF HIS MINISTRY, ENVIRONMENT AND TOURISM, WAS </p><p>AN AREA THAT ESPECIALLY LENT ITSELF TO BIPARTISANSHIP, </p><p>AND HE URGED THE DEPUTY MINISTER TO WORK IN THAT </p><p>DIRECTION. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) COMMENT: WE SUSPECT THAT CHINDORI-CHININGA MAY BE </p><p>DISSEMBLING ON THE GENERATIONAL DIVIDE THAT EXISTS IN </p><p>THE PARTY AND DOWN PLAYING ITS AMBITION TO WREST CONTROL </p><p>OF THE REINS OF POWER FROM THE OLD GUARD.  AT THE MOMENT </p><p>THERE IS LITTLE HEAD ROOM FOR THIS GROUP.
