<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 001720 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS, DS/DSS/ITA, S/CT; </p><p>NSC FOR E. MILLARD; LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  09-16-12 </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PGOV, EAIR, ASEC, MV, IN, SE </p><p>SUBJECT:  Incident remains very murky, but hijack </p><p>attempt near Maldives may have had an Islamic connection </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  (A) USDAO Colombo Ce IIR 6 816 0113 02 </p><p>-      (B) USDAO Colombo Ce IIR 6 816 0111 02 </p><p>-      (C) Port Louis 1059 </p><p>-      (D) Port Louis 1055 </p><p>-      (E) USDAO Colombo Ce IIR 6 816 0110 02 </p><p>-      (F) Colombo 1662, and previous </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by W. Lewis Amselem, Charge d\'Affaires. </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b, d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary:  Amid many conflicting, convoluted </p><p>reports, Mission has received tentative information that </p><p>the attempted hijacking of an Air Seychelles flight near </p><p>the Maldives last week may have had an Islamic </p><p>connection.  Information is very sketchy, but DAO has </p><p>learned that of the ten men now in detention in the </p><p>Maldives one may be a Bangladeshi national and some of </p><p>the rest Muslims from the Indian state of Gujarat </p><p>(Mission has received late word that some of these men </p><p>have been released).  Given the timeframe of the </p><p>incident (just before the 9/11 anniversary), this latest </p><p>information is possibly indicative of some sort of </p><p>Islamic extremist plot, although it is not conclusive in </p><p>any way.  A/RSO, previously scheduled to travel to the </p><p>Maldives on September 17, will coordinate with Maldivian </p><p>authorities in an attempt to gather definitive </p><p>information about this murky incident.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Mission continues to pick up conflicting and </p><p>convoluted reports about the September 9 attempt to </p><p>hijack an Air Seychelles flight near the Maldives. </p><p>Initial reports indicated that the attempt was carried </p><p>out by an apparently unstable individual, an Indian </p><p>national armed with a knife, who was apprehended by </p><p>cabin personnel when he attempted to break into the </p><p>cockpit.  Subsequent reports indicated that the </p><p>Maldivian authorities were holding ten of the plane\'s </p><p>passengers for investigation, all apparently Indians </p><p>with Hindu names (see Para three).  Per Ref A, DAO </p><p>sources now state that of the ten men being detained in </p><p>the incident at least one may be a Bangladeshi national </p><p>and at least some of the others Muslims from the Indian </p><p>state of Gujarat.  This is the first information that </p><p>Mission has received indicating that the incident may </p><p>have had any Islamic connection.  According to DAO </p><p>sources, there is also new information that those </p><p>detained may have wanted to take the aircraft to an </p><p>unknown destination in the Middle East.  (Note:  Late </p><p>September 16, Mission heard that nine of the ten men </p><p>detained were released.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) The latest information that at least some of </p><p>those detained may possibly be Muslims contradicts </p><p>earlier reports that made out the alleged perpetrators </p><p>to be Indian nationals who were apparently Hindus based </p><p>on the names in their passports.  Sources now report </p><p>that the passports of those detained may have have been </p><p>forged, perhaps in Nairobi, Kenya.  (Note:  Ref B </p><p>contains a list of the purported names of those </p><p>detained.  Initial Washington checks have turned up no </p><p>information on these names.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Despite the new information, there is still no </p><p>indication on whether the attempted hijacking involved a </p><p>political motivation, such as Islamic extremism.  For </p><p>their part, the Maldivian Ministry of Foreign Affairs </p><p>and the Maldivian National Security Service have told </p><p>Mission that they do not (repeat not) believe that the </p><p>attempted hijacking had an Islamic extremist motivation. </p><p>They note, however, that their investigation into the </p><p>case is continuing.  Mission understands that the Indian </p><p>government is also looking into what transpired.  (Note: </p><p>The Indian High Commission has confirmed that Prime </p><p>Minister Vajpayee plans to travel to the Maldives at </p><p>some point in the next week on a long-planned visit.) </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Comment:  Given the constant swirl of </p><p>conflicting reports, the whole incident seems murky at </p><p>best.  The latest information that the alleged </p><p>perpetrators of the attempted hijacking may be Muslims </p><p>is very tentative, but it raises the troubling question </p><p>of whether the incident involved some sort of Islamic </p><p>extremist plot.  It should not be overlooked, for </p><p>example, that the incident took place on September 9, </p><p>just before the one-year anniversary of 9/11.  (Note: </p><p>According to press reports, three men carrying knives </p><p>were also detained by Indian authorities on September 9 </p><p>for attempting to board a flight to Riyadh at Bombay\'s </p><p>international airport.)  The possibility that the </p><p>incident also involved passports forged so as to make </p><p>the bearer out to be a non-Muslim is also interesting </p><p>from a modus operandi standpoint. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) In an attempt to gather definitive </p><p>information,  A/RSO, previously scheduled to travel to </p><p>the Maldives on September 17, will coordinate with </p><p>Maldivian authorities about this murky incident.  End </p><p>Comment. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>AMSELEM </p><p></p></div>
