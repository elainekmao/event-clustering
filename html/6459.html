(SBU) While fundamentally sound, the Jordanian banking </p><p>sector faces a number of short- and long-term challenges: </p><p>Exposure to a military conflict with Iraq, a surplus of </p><p>banks, high infrastructure costs, and implementation of </p><p>modern banking and technological advances that are only now </p><p>beginning to take hold.   Having said that, under the </p><p>watchful eye of the Central Bank of Jordan, the sector seems </p><p>primed to weather the coming storm, and may well prosper in a </p><p>post-Saddam environment. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>THE SECTOR IN GENERAL </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Dominated by three major players--the Arab Bank </p><p>(REF D), the Housing Bank, and the Jordanian National Bank, </p><p>which account for 73% of the sector\'s assets (JD15.1 </p><p>billion/$21.2 billion)--the Jordanian banking system </p><p>continues to strive to become a healthy, progressive, </p><p>customer focused service industry.  It consists of 21 banks, </p><p>three of them foreign, with 466 branches.  In addition, </p><p>Jordanian banks have 119 branches abroad, 60 of which are in </p><p>the West Bank/Gaza.  Jordanian banks have branches in the </p><p>U.S., Lebanon, Cyprus, and the Gulf, with pending </p><p>applications in Algeria and Syria.  Most banks recorded </p><p>profits last year at 10% or less, but expect a hard to flat </p><p>year for 2003.  The monthly bulletin of the Central Bank of </p><p>Jordan (CBJ), available at www.cbj.gov.jo, contains timely </p><p>statistical information on the sector. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) The banking sector has recently undergone </p><p>consolidation, as the CBJ has taken over the administration </p><p>of two banks, the Philadelphia Investment Bank and the Jordan </p><p>Gulf Bank, due to mismanagement and losses brought on by the </p><p>banks\' exposure to the Shemaileh scandal, in which a </p><p>Jordanian businessman arranged approximately $100 million in </p><p>unsecured loans and subsequently fled the country (REF E). </p><p>Foreign banks do not figure prominently--HSBC, Citibank, and </p><p>the Egyptian Land Bank hold merely 2.4% of the system\'s </p><p>assets--but do put some pressure on established banks to keep </p><p>up with global innovations in technology and product </p><p>offerings.  There are two Islamic banks in Jordan: the Jordan </p><p>Islamic Bank and the International Arab Islamic Bank, part of </p><p>the Arab Bank Group, accounting for almost 4% of the sector\'s </p><p>assets.  Owing to an increase in banking awareness, deposits </p><p>in Jordanian banks have grown by an average of 13% per year </p><p>since 1980, from approximately JD700 million ($980 million) </p><p>in 1980 to JD8.1 billion ($11.3 billion) in 2001.  The share </p><p>of bank deposits in the money supply, an indication of a </p><p>country\'s rate of economic development, has increased to 62% </p><p>last year from 49% in 1993. </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>IRAQ EXPOSURE </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Jordanian officials have repeatedly stressed to </p><p>Embassy their concern about the banking sector\'s exposure to </p><p>Iraq and the possible negative impact on the banking system </p><p>of a military conflict.  Banks\' exposure to companies doing </p><p>business with Iraq is approximately $370 million in terms of </p><p>contracts yet to be executed, according to CBJ officials. </p><p>The number three Jordanian National Bank (JNB) in particular </p><p>is most exposed, and four or five smaller banks are also </p><p>exposed to varying degrees.  The CBJ fears that, once a </p><p>conflict begins, OFF-related deliveries to Iraq, much of </p><p>which were perishables, will cease, the contracts will be </p><p>voided, the goods will spoil, and the Jordanian banks will </p><p>hold millions of dollars in what would become nonperforming </p><p>loans.  According to a top CBJ official, the Bank would be </p><p>prepared to provide emergency loans to the JNB or other banks </p><p>that suffered a temporary liquidity crisis because of OFF </p><p>exposure.  He hoped, however, that it would not come to this </p><p>because of the very negative public signal it could send </p><p>about the banking system\'s integrity, particularly during a </p><p>period of expected political turmoil and with two banks </p><p>already under CBJ control. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) The CBJ hopes that once a conflict begins, the UN </p><p>will quickly establish new OFF procedures that would allow </p><p>goods be delivered instead to Aqaba, where they could be held </p><p>in a warehouse until hostilities ended and deliveries to Iraq </p><p>could resume.  This would allow Jordanian banks to continue </p><p>to be paid from the OFF account.  We have advised the </p><p>Jordanian government to address this problem with the UN. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) Nase Khamhawi, President of the Association of </p><p>Jordan Banks, told us he was most concerned over trade </p><p>exposure with Iraq, and said that "many factories are set up </p><p>just to do business with Iraq", and that banks that have </p><p>relationships with these companies would be adversely </p><p>affected by conflict.  Ali al-Hosri, of the Export Finance </p><p>Bank, echoed Khamis\'s concerns.  He said that his bank was </p><p>also studying alternative points of delivery in Jordan where </p><p>the goods could be stored pending a resolution of </p><p>hostilities.  As early as December, he said, banks were </p><p>working to reduce their potential exposure by not financing </p><p>some contracts as they came up for review.  Zachy Anderson, </p><p>CEO of HSBC Middle East, said foreign banks in the region "do </p><p>virtually no business with Iraq," but said he sensed that </p><p>some local banks would be hurt.  He added, however, that one </p><p>unintended consequence of an Iraqi conflict might be the </p><p>"bursting of the property bubble" in prosperous West Amman, </p><p>given heavy exposure by banks to loans for homes built as </p><p>investment property and the danger of default given adverse </p><p>effects on the Jordanian economy at large in a prolonged </p><p>conflict. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU)  In addition to the trade exposure, CBJ officials </p><p>estimate that there are JD 600 million ($840 million) in </p><p>Iraqi deposits in the Jordanian banking system, with JNB </p><p>again being a leading recipient.  The CBJ has put together a </p><p>plan to ensure that these deposits, which amount to about 7% </p><p>of total deposits, are not precipitously withdrawn during a </p><p>military conflict.  The plan includes freezing accounts of </p><p>the Iraqi government, known front companies, and senior </p><p>officials and carefully monitoring large and suspicious </p><p>movements in other Iraqi accounts. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>MAYBE A RUN, BUT NO PROBLEM </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) Most bankers we spoke with expressed optimism that </p><p>the sector would weather any crisis brought on by a war with </p><p>Iraq.  One executive, however, suggested that "it would take </p><p>months for the sector to recover".  He saw a worst case </p><p>scenario in which a total shutdown of airspace would lead to </p><p>hoarding of dollars.  Khamhawi had the opposite view.  He </p><p>said that banks were well-prepared to handle the conflict. </p><p>As in 1991, he and other informal observers opine, there </p><p>would be a "small rush on the banks, maybe for a few days" </p><p>and then customers would return to redeposit the withdrawn </p><p>funds.  CBJ officials believe that the Bank\'s $3 billion in </p><p>foreign reserves provide a more than adequate cushion to cope </p><p>with any short-term run on Jordanian banks. </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>TOO MANY BANKS </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU) Among the longer term issues is the "over-banking" </p><p>of Jordan.  With so many branches and bank offices, Jordan </p><p>presently has about one bank per 10,000 people (compared to </p><p>about one per 30,000 in the Gulf).  CBJ Head of Banking </p><p>Supervision Mai Khamis said many of these are weak, small, </p><p>family-run banks that pose a risk to depositors and borrowers </p><p>alike.  To encourage consolidation, the CBJ doubled minimum </p><p>capital requirements in 2002 to JD40 million ($56 million) in </p><p>order to force the merger or acquisition of the weaker banks. </p><p> She quickly added that the CBJ was not interested in the </p><p>smaller banks combining with one another, making "one big, </p><p>weak bank."  Rather, Khamis said, the CBJ hopes that stronger </p><p>banks take over smaller institutions when "opportunities </p><p>present themselves".  This in turn would lead to savings on </p><p>overhead and operating costs, encourage efficiency and </p><p>increased use of technology, and dilute the conservative </p><p>influence of family-owned banks on a sector that\'s flush with </p><p>liquidity.  (NOTE: Talks are under way for the acquisition of </p><p>Jordan Gulf Bank by the Arab Bank.  Likewise, the Housing </p><p>Bank is moving to acquire the Philadelphia Investment Bank, </p><p>under CBJ administration since last year.  END NOTE)  Cairo </p><p>Amman Bank has also indicated interest in the possibility of </p><p>merging with one of the smaller banks if a financially-sound </p><p>candidate comes on offer. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>INTEREST RATE SPREAD </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU) One of business people\'s main complaints is that </p><p>borrowing rates remain relatively high despite a reduction in </p><p>deposit and CBJ rates in recent years.  The current CBJ </p><p>discount rate is 4.5%.  The average interbank loan interest </p><p>rate stands currently at 2.875%.  The average interest rate </p><p>on consumer loans is 9.85%, with most loans having a tenure </p><p>of five years or less.  In addition, most banks charge an </p><p>annual commission of 1%.  The interest rate for deposits is </p><p>3.9%, and while commercial banks in Jordan have progressively </p><p>lowered interest rates on both deposits and credit facilities </p><p>in concert with U.S. interest rate drops, rates on deposits </p><p>have dropped at a much faster clip.  Since 1999, the interest </p><p>rate on time deposits has declined from 7.9% to 3.9%, while </p><p>credit rates have gone from 12.6% to 9.85% in the same </p><p>period.  Currently, the nominal spread between credit and </p><p>deposit rates is 5.9%.  Interest rate spreads are an </p><p>indication of the general attractiveness of a country for </p><p>investment and the ability of the private sector to finance </p><p>investment activities. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (SBU) Citing an IMF study (Understanding the Margin </p><p>Between Lending and Deposit Rates in Jordan), CBJ officials </p><p>assert the spread between lending and deposit rates in Jordan </p><p>is not especially high compared to other developing </p><p>countries.  (NOTE: Some spreads within the region bear this </p><p>out: Bahrain, 7.6%; Lebanon, 6.5%; Morocco, 7.4%.  In </p><p>contrast: Egypt, 4.2%; Israel, 3.9%; Oman, 3.2%; Kuwait, 3%. </p><p>END NOTE)  Khamis told us that high operating costs fueled by </p><p>excess labor rendered the sector as a whole inefficient in </p><p>its management of overhead costs, typically as high as 4-5%, </p><p>as it is "socially difficult" to fire anyone.  She added that </p><p>corporate taxes for banks, now at 35%, are higher than for </p><p>any other sector.  In addition, due to a history of </p><p>nonperforming loans, banks must impose higher interest rates </p><p>in order to offset their losses.  Private bankers, as well as </p><p>CBJ officials strongly resent recent high profile efforts by </p><p>some GOJ officials, notably Economy Minister Samer al-Tawil, </p><p>to jawbone" banks into cutting borrowing rates.  They expect </p><p>that over time the markets will do their work.  However, as </p><p>an Amman Chamber of Commerce official told us, that time may </p><p>be too long in coming for some companies. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>CREDIT AND CONSUMER PRODUCTS </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  (SBU) At the same time, credit as a share of GDP is low, </p><p>and banks have been slow to introduce innovative new </p><p>products.  Bank credit extended in Jordan currently amounts </p><p>to JD 5.2 billion ($7.3 billion), an average increase of 12% </p><p>per year since 1980, and an indication that Jordan\'s </p><p>traditionally tight credit market is loosening.  Most loans </p><p>go to general trade (JD 1.2 billion/$1.7 billion), </p><p>construction (JD800 million/$1.1 billion), and industry </p><p>(JD800 million/$1.1 billion).  The banks, however, are quite </p><p>liquid, with about JD15 billion ($11.2 billion) in total </p><p>assets.  Just under 2% of Jordanian loans are made by foreign </p><p>banks.   Central Bank officials say that Jordan is committed </p><p>to implementing "Basel II" capital adequacy standards, </p><p>although banks will need technical assistance to put in place </p><p>appropriate internal rating systems. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (SBU) Local banks, pushed by foreign competition, are </p><p>beginning to recognize the profitability of expanding </p><p>consumer credit.  Cairo Amman is emblematic of the push to </p><p>pursue the consumer credit market, which officials say caters </p><p>to Jordan\'s young population.  C-A officials told us, for </p><p>example, that a majority of the bank\'s 70,000 borrowers are </p><p>government employees, "a good risk, because they have jobs </p><p>and salaries for life."  The bank is increasing its long-term </p><p>lending as well; its 20-year loan portfolio expanded from $8 </p><p>million to $21 million in 2002, and it established a real </p><p>estate site linked to its webpage where prospective home </p><p>buyers can view properties, calculate mortgage rates, and </p><p>apply for home loans.  (NOTE: According to bank figures, the </p><p>average mortgage is JD30,000 ($42,000) at 10% interest for 20 </p><p>years and requires 20% as down payment. END NOTE.)  HSBC has </p><p>just rolled out a 20 year mortgage product at 7.25% interest, </p><p>the harbinger perhaps of further reduction of rates and a </p><p>narrowing of the spread.  Defaults on mortgages are rare as </p><p>people do not want "to lose their dream home", as one banker </p><p>told us. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (SBU) Auto loans can be problematic.  Issued at 9% </p><p>interest and requiring 30% of the price of the car for down </p><p>payment, they also generally carry an annual charge of 10% of </p><p>the principle of the loan, bringing the real interest rate </p><p>closer to about 17%.  These charges are not often disclosed </p><p>until the contract for the loan is presented to the borrower, </p><p>but, as there is currently no "truth in lending law" in </p><p>Jordan, car buyers have little recourse. </p><p> </p><p>15.  (SBU) Nonperforming loans, set by the CBJ at 90 days as </p><p>opposed to the more common 180 days, make it difficult for </p><p>banks to price their credit facilities to other than their </p><p>traditional large, institutional customers.  But Khamis </p><p>defended the relatively short rating period and said that the </p><p>level of nonperforming loans in the system at 15% is </p><p>"unacceptable" and hoped to see the rate drop closer to 10%. </p><p>She said that even the healthy Housing Bank has a 14% rate of </p><p>nonperforming loans, and that lengthening the rating period </p><p>would not matter as banks just make fresh loans to their </p><p>favored clients in any case.  Regarding specific sectors that </p><p>may be more vulnerable in case of conflict, such as the </p><p>tourism industry, one banker shrugged it off and said, "You </p><p>can\'t own a hotel unless you own a bank", citing </p><p>cross-ownership between the hotel and banking sectors. </p><p>(NOTE:  For example, the Sabih al-Masri family owns the Zara </p><p>Hotel Company, and, due to partial ownership, has </p><p>representatives on the Board of Directors the Cairo Amman </p><p>Bank.  The Muasher family, owners of the hotel chain that </p><p>owns Marriott hotels in Jordan, has a spot on the Jordan </p><p>National Bank board.  End Note.)  Indeed, according to CBJ </p><p>figures, current sector exposure to tourism, hotels, and </p><p>restaurants is relatively low, at JD174 million ($244 </p><p>million). </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>CREDIT BUREAU LAW </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>16.  (SBU) One of the major structural deficiencies in the </p><p>banking system is the absence of a system for sharing credit </p><p>information.  As part of its FY 2003 cash transfer, the USG </p><p>made the passage of the Credit Bureau Law "in principle" a </p><p>condition precedent.  The Cabinet passed the law in January </p><p>2003, and the Law is currently in the Legislative Bureau for </p><p>final and thorough review.  Ahead of final implementation of </p><p>the Law, Khamis said, the CBJ maintains credit information on </p><p>all borrowers with loans above JD50,000 ($70,000), </p><p>information that is available to all banks upon request.  The </p><p>Association of Banks in Jordan is also in the process of </p><p>establishing a credit bureau, which will grow out of a </p><p>current database that tracks all loans over JSD30,000 </p><p>($42,000).  There is also a nascent debt collection industry </p><p>in Jordan. </p><p> </p><p>17.  (SBU) The use of checks as an instrument of transaction </p><p>dropped by 3% in 2002, but has generally remained constant. </p><p>Both the value and the percentage of returned checks have </p><p>been steadily dropping as well, as most banks increase </p><p>overdraft facilities, albeit at high (9%) interest rates.  A </p><p>private company working for a consortium of banks, and not </p><p>licensed by the CBJ, maintains a database on bounced checks, </p><p>as does the Association of Banks in Jordan (ABJ). </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>TECHNOLOGY CATCHING UP </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>18.  (SBU) The use of ATMs has caught on in the Kingdom, with </p><p>325 ATMs now in use throughout the country.  (NOTE: According </p><p>to Cairo-Amman, each ATM replaces three to four employees, </p><p>resulting in lower overhead and reducing the long-term </p><p>utility of maintaining branches.  END NOTE)  Most of the </p><p>larger banks are linking their branches to one another </p><p>on-line, and many of them are planning to offer on-line </p><p>banking once security and encryption concerns are ironed out. </p><p> Concurrently, credit card penetration has increased as well </p><p>as banks recognize the profit potential in consumer credit. </p><p>According to Visa Jordan officials, 120,000 cards are </p><p>currently in use, with an increase of 830% in the number of </p><p>transactions since 1998.  3700 merchants are currently </p><p>connected via POS (Point of Sale) units.  The popularity in </p><p>debit cards is also growing, especially among students. </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>SHEMAILEH </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>19.  (SBU) The country was shaken early last year by the </p><p>Shemaileh scandal, but CBJ officials said the effects of the </p><p>scandal were receding, as the takeover of the Jordan Gulf </p><p>Bank by the CBJ addressed one of the Shemaileh legacies (REF </p><p>A).  Khamis said the sector recovered some of the lost funds </p><p>via the sale of various Shemaileh assets seized by GOJ </p><p>authorities during the investigation and following his </p><p>arrest.  She noted the investigation was continuing, but </p><p>winding down.  Khamis stressed the way to prevent recurrence </p><p>of fraud is by strengthening market discipline via strong </p><p>corporate governance.  However, she said this was difficult </p><p>to accomplish in Jordan where bankers traditionally maintain </p><p>relationships based on "who you are" rather than the </p><p>soundness of a business\'s balance sheet. </p><p> </p><p>20.  (SBU) Khamis said that CBJ Governor Toukan is </p><p>"unshakable" in his determination to protect depositors and </p><p>modernize and strengthen the Jordanian banking industry in </p><p>order to prevent another "Shemaileh."  She said that Toukan </p><p>has the advantage of never having worked in the private </p><p>sector, and thus "does not owe anyone anything."  But given </p><p>that some influential Jordanian bankers are former GOJ </p><p>officials, she added, his job is complicated. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>WEST BANK/GAZA EXPOSURE </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>21.  (SBU) Khamis said Jordanian banks, particularly the </p><p>Cairo Amman Bank and the Arab Bank (REF D), were highly </p><p>exposed to West Bank/Gaza to the tune of about JD267 million </p><p>($374 million).  She expressed outrage at a January Israeli </p><p>Defense Force (IDF) action against an Arab Bank branch in the </p><p>West Bank (REF C), and said "These are Jordanian banks!"  She </p><p>cautioned that "this sort of thing starts with one incident </p><p>and then becomes the practice."  (NOTE:  On March 2, the IDF </p><p>again conducted a raid on the Arab Bank.  (REF B)  End Note) </p><p>She said that Jordanian banks have approximately 60 branches </p><p>in West Bank/Gaza, and the Jordanian Dinar is the primary </p><p>medium of exchange on the West Bank. </p><p> </p><p>22.  (SBU) Cairo Amman officials told us the bank is heavily </p><p>exposed in Palestine, as one of the first to open on the West </p><p>Bank in 1986.  Counting their offices in Gaza, the bank has </p><p>19 branches in the Occupied Territories, with $500 million in </p><p>the West Bank alone.  In December, the Jenin branch, </p><p>uninsured for acts of war, was hit by an Israeli shell marked </p><p>for a nearby bomb-making facility, causing $100,000 in damage </p><p>to the bank.  The bankers said that business was bad, and </p><p>that Cairo Amman was no longer making loans in the </p><p>Territories, merely managing existing ones.  "When loans </p><p>become non-performing after 90 days," one official told us, </p><p>"what can you do for someone from Nablus, who has been under </p><p>curfew for 120 days."  In addition, he said, "the economy is </p><p>in recession, there is no new investment, and what loans we </p><p>have are not being repaid.  Things are bad." </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>REMITTANCES </p><p>----------- </p><p>23.  (SBU) Bank officials told us that workers\' remittances </p><p>from abroad take a number of forms, according to bank </p><p>officials.  Most remittances, which come from the Gulf </p><p>countries, enter via banks.  Some of the funds are </p><p>hand-carried by workers as they return.  Money Grams are </p><p>gaining in use, primarily by Filipino and Sri Lankan expats </p><p>wiring money to their families back home.  After a lull </p><p>caused by the expulsion of Jordanian workers during and </p><p>following the Gulf War, (a scenario most observers expect </p><p>will not be repeated), remittances have steadily increased </p><p>since 1992 and reached $1.7 billion in 2000, 20% of Jordan\'s </p><p>GDP. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>24.  (SBU) As most things Jordanian, the banking sector feels </p><p>the stress of having neighbors on either side that act as a </p><p>real or potential liability on its balance sheet.  Flush with </p><p>reserves and relatively stable, however, the system can stand </p><p>short term strains provided that, as in the last Gulf War, </p><p>regional stability holds.   In the longer term, the extent to </p><p>which Jordanian banks continue to respond to market forces </p><p>and innovate may lead to even greater opportunities for the </p><p>Jordanian banks and their clients as a post-Saddam Iraq comes </p><p>into focus.  USAID is helping this process through a series </p><p>of targeted technical assistance and training programs that </p><p>should help modernize bank supervision and management, with </p><p>the ultimate goal of loosening currently trapped liquidity </p><p>for productive investment in economic activities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
