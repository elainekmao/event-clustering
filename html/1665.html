REASONS: 1.5 </p><p>(B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) THE OPPOSITION MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC) HAS </p><p>STRENGTHENED ITS INTERNAL STRUCTURES AND PUT IN PLACE A RIGOROUS </p><p>POLICY-VETTING PROCESS.  THE LACK OF ADEQUATE RESOURCES, HOWEVER, </p><p>CONTINUES TO POSE A PROBLEM, EXACERBATED BY THE GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>REFUSAL TO GIVE THE MDC FUNDS TO WHICH IT IS LEGALLY ENTITLED AND </p><p>BY THE PASSAGE OF LEGISLATION PROHIBITING POLITICAL PARTIES FROM </p><p>RECEIVING FOREIGN FUNDING.  THE MDC WILL TRY TO PLAY ABOVEBOARD AS </p><p>MUCH AS POSSIBLE BUT LIKELY WILL HAVE TO ENGAGE IN A BIT OF </p><p>"CREATIVE FINANCING."  IN AN EFFORT TO AVOID PROVOKING ZANU-PF, THE </p><p>MDC IS CAMPAIGNING FOR THE 2002 PRESIDENCY ACTIVELY BUT QUIETLY. </p><p>IT IS HOLDING FEWER LARGE RALLIES AND IS SENDING SMALL TEAMS TO </p><p>RURAL AREAS AROUND THE COUNTRY TO CAMPAIGN DOOR-TO-DOOR.  THE </p><p>OPPOSITION PARTY HAS NOT AGREED HOW TO REACT IN THE EVENT THAT </p><p>PRESIDENT MUGABE WINS AN ILLEGITIMATE ELECTION, AN INCREASINGLY </p><p>LIKELY SCENARIO.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>STRUCTURAL CHANGES </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) DURING THE PAST TWO MONTHS, THE MDC HAS TAKEN STEPS TO </p><p>STRENGTHEN ITS ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURES.  ISAAC MAPOSA, WHO LAST </p><p>YEAR LED THE NATIONAL CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY\'S OPPOSITION TO THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01495  01 OF 03  021539Z </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S DRAFT CONSTITUTION, JOINED THE MDC IN EARLY MARCH AS </p><p>ITS NATIONAL COORDINATOR.  MAPOSA TOLD POLITICAL SECTION CHIEF ON </p><p>APRIL 25 THAT, WHEN HE BEGAN WORK, HE WAS SURPRISED BY THE NUMBER </p><p>OF EMPLOYEES IN THE MDC\'S OFFICES WITHOUT CLEAR RESPONSIBILITIES. </p><p>HE FIRED A NUMBER OF PEOPLE AND HAS CONCENTRATED ON DEVELOPING </p><p>POSITION DESCRIPTIONS FOR THOSE WHO REMAIN.  IN ADDITION, HE HAS </p><p>WORKED TO ENSURE ACCOUNTABILITY AMONG THE OPPOSITION PARTY\'S TEN </p><p>DEPARTMENTS, BY HELPING DEPARTMENT HEADS DEVELOP REALISTIC WORK </p><p>PLANS AND REQUIRING REGULAR ACTIVITY REPORTS.  IN ADDITION, MAPOSA </p><p>EMPHASIZED THAT HE DOES NOT SET THE MDC\'S POLICY AGENDA.  RATHER, </p><p>HE SEES HIMSELF MORE AS A FACILITATOR, WHOSE ROLE IS TO BRING </p><p>TOGETHER THE PARTY LEADERSHIP WHEN IMPORTANT ISSUES MUST BE </p><p>DISCUSSED AND THEN IMPLEMENTS THEIR DECISIONS. </p><p> </p><p>POLICY DEVELOPMENT </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) ACCORDING TO MAPOSA, THE MDC HAS CONTINUED TO ORGANIZE </p><p>REGULAR RETREATS TO DEVELOP THE PARTY\'S POLICY POSITIONS.  IN </p><p>JANUARY, THE PARTY\'S EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE, MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT, </p><p>AND PROVINCIAL LEADERS HELD A RETREAT TO DISCUSS LAND AND THE </p><p>ECONOMY AND, IN MARCH, HELD ONE ON HEALTH AND EDUCATION.  ON MAY 5, </p><p>THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE PLANS TO MEET TO ENDORSE THE POSITIONS </p><p>DEVELOPED AND AGREE ON AN APPROACH FOR PUBLIC DISSEMINATION.  A </p><p>MID-MAY RETREAT HAS BEEN ORGANIZED TO DEFINE THE PARTY\'S IDEOLOGY, </p><p>PARTICULARLY WHAT IT MEANS TO BE SOCIAL DEMOCRATS IN THE ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>CONTEXT.  AGREEMENT ON IDEOLOGY AND THE DETAILS, MAPOSA NOTED, WILL </p><p>HELP ENSURE DEVELOPMENT OF CONSISTENT POLICIES AND A CONSISTENT </p><p>MESSAGE.  THE MID-MAY MEETING WILL ALSO FOCUS ON CRAFTING AN </p><p>EFFECTIVE DIPLOMATIC APPROACH TOWARD THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  01495  01 OF 03  021539Z </p><p>MEDIA STRATEGY </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) THE MDC HAS IN RECENT WEEKS MADE NOTICEABLE IMPROVEMENTS IN </p><p>USING THE PRESS TO GET OUT ITS MESSAGE, DUE IN LARGE MEASURE TO </p><p>INTENSIVE TRAINING -- PROVIDED BY THE INTERNATIONAL REPUBLICAN </p><p>INSTITUTE (IRI) IN EARLY APRIL IN BOTSWANA -- ON MESSAGE </p><p>DEVELOPMENT AND PUBLIC SPEAKING.  THE RECENT HIRING OF A MEDIA </p><p>RELATIONS PROFESSIONAL HAS ALSO HAD AN OBVIOUS POSITIVE IMPACT. </p><p>MAPOSA AGREED THAT THE PARTY\'S MEDIA PERSON IS GOOD, BUT HE IS THE </p><p>ONLY OFFICER IN A DEPARTMENT THAT NEEDS AT LEAST FOUR PEOPLE TO BE </p><p>MOST EFFECTIVE.  MAPOSA INDICATED THAT THE PARTY PLANS TO USE THE </p><p>PRESS EVEN MORE, AND HAS BEGUN TO ORGANIZE PUBLIC EVENTS AROUND THE </p><p>MEDIA ATTENTION THEY ARE LIKELY TO GENERATE.  (COMMENT: MDC </p><p>PRESIDENT MORGAN TSVANGIRAI\'S RECENT VISIT TO THE MASS GRAVES OF </p><p>VICTIMS OF THE GOVERNMENT\'S 1980\'S BRUTAL CAMPAIGN AGAINST </p><p>DISSIDENTS IS A CASE IN POINT.  THE VISIT DEMONSTRATED LEADERSHIP </p><p>ON A PAINFUL, UNRESOLVED ISSUE ABOUT WHICH GOVERNMENT REMAINS </p><p>EXTREMELY SENSITIVE, GENERATED SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE PRESS COVERAGE </p><p>AND HELPED CONSOLIDATE TSVANGIRAI\'S ALREADY STRONG SUPPORT IN </p><p>MATABELELAND.

(C) SECURING ADEQUATE RESOURCES CONTINUES TO POSE A SERIOUS </p><p>OBSTACLE FOR THE MDC, A TASK MADE EVEN MORE DIFFICULT BY </p><p>PARLIAMENT\'S RECENT PASSAGE OF LEGISLATION PROHIBITING DIRECT AND </p><p>INDIRECT FOREIGN FUNDING OF POLITICAL PARTIES (REF A).  IN </p><p>ADDITION, THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOT YET FULFILLED ITS COMMITMENT -- </p><p>MADE IN LATE FEBRUARY -- TO RELEASE TO THE MDC WITHIN 30 DAYS 47 </p><p>MILLION ZIMBABWEAN DOLLARS (NOW APPROXIMATELY U.S. $470,000) TO </p><p>WHICH IT IS LEGALLY ENTITLED, BY VIRTUE OF ITS STRONG SHOWING IN </p><p>THE JUNE 2000 PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION.  INTER ALIA, THE NEW </p><p>POLITICAL PARTIES FINANCING LAW PRECLUDES THE PROVISION OF SERVICES </p><p>FOR PARTY-BUILDING ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS IRI\'S RECENT WORKSHOP IN </p><p>BOTSWANA DESCRIBED IN PARA 5.  NGOS AND DONORS ARE UNSURE ABOUT THE </p><p>IMPACT OF THE NEW LEGISLATION ON MANY OF THEIR ACTIVITIES.  IRI </p><p>REGIONAL DIRECTOR KATHI WALTHER TOLD POLITICAL SECTION CHIEF ON </p><p>APRIL 30 THAT HER ORGANIZATION WOULD CONTINUE TO OFFER SIMILAR </p><p>TRAINING, BUT LIKELY WOULD HAVE TO PROVIDE IT OUTSIDE OF ZIMBABWE. </p><p>SOME DONORS HAVE MADE HURRIED CAPITAL INVESTMENTS OR DEPOSITED </p><p>MONEY IN FOREIGN BANK ACCOUNTS IN ANTICIPATION OF THE PRESIDENT\'S </p><p>SIGNATURE OF THE BILL, WHICH IS SILENT ON THE QUESTION OF PENALTIES </p><p>FOR DONORS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) MDC MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT DAVID COLTART TOLD POLITICAL </p><p>SECTION CHIEF RECENTLY THAT THE LAW WAS INTENDED TO CRUSH THE </p><p>OPPOSITION PARTY, AND MIGHT HAVE THE EFFECT OF DRIVING THE MDC </p><p>UNDERGROUND.  IN THE MEANTIME, THE MDC WOULD SEEK TO SIGN </p><p>COMMERCIAL LOAN AGREEMENTS -- WHICH ARE NOT PROHIBITED -- WITH </p><p>DONOR NATIONS AND INDIVIDUALS.  COLTART INDICATED THAT THE PARTY </p><p>PLANNED TO CHALLENGE THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE BILL, BECAUSE IT </p><p>VIOLATES THE RIGHT TO FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION AND PREVENTS </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN CITIZENS LIVING ABROAD FROM CONTRIBUTING TO POLITICAL </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01495  02 OF 03  021540Z </p><p>PARTIES.  ISAAC MAPOSA EMPHASIZED THAT THE MDC WOULD TRY TO PLAY </p><p>ABOVEBOARD AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE, BUT HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE PARTY </p><p>INEVITABLY WOULD HAVE TO ENGAGE IN "CREATIVE FINANCING."  ONE </p><p>OPTION THE MDC WAS EXPLORING WAS TO ASK FOREIGN DONORS TO DEPOSIT </p><p>FUNDS IN OVERSEAS ACCOUNTS BELONGING TO LOCAL ZIMBABWEAN COMPANIES, </p><p>WHICH COULD IN TURN MAKE OSTENSIBLY "LOCAL" CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE </p><p>OPPOSITION PARTY.  IN ADDITION, JOHN MAKUMBE, A POLITICAL SCIENCE </p><p>PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ZIMBABWE, PRESIDENT OF TRANSPARENCY </p><p>INTERNATIONAL-ZIMBABWE, AND REGULAR ADVISOR TO THE MDC LEADERSHIP, </p><p>IS PRESSING THE OPPOSITION PARTY TO ESTABLISH ITS OWN OFFSHORE BANK </p><p>ACCOUNTS IN ORDER TO FACILITATE FOREIGN DONATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN STRATEGY </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) THE CAMPAIGN FOR THE 2002 PRESIDENTIAL VOTE HAS BEGUN IN </p><p>EARNEST.  ZANU-PF, THROUGH ITS GANGSTER MILITIA OF WAR VETERANS AND </p><p>THUGS FOR HIRE, HAS CONTINUED ITS INTIMIDATION OF RESIDENTS IN </p><p>RURAL AREAS AND HIGH-DENSITY SUBURBS, AND RECENTLY EXPANDED ITS </p><p>TERROR CAMPAIGN TO URBAN AREAS, WHERE IT IS TARGETTING COMPANIES </p><p>AND NGOS SUSPECTING OF SUPPORTING THE OPPOSITION.  THE MDC IS </p><p>CAMPAIGNING ACTIVELY AS WELL, BUT HAS OPTED FOR A LOW-KEY, NON- </p><p>CONFRONTATIONAL APPROACH.  MAKUMBE POINTED OUT THAT THE MDC IS </p><p>STRONGER THAN IT WAS A YEAR AGO, BUT IT REMAINS FRAGILE BECAUSE IT </p><p>IS THE ONLY HOPE FOR MOST ZIMBABWEANS OF A BETTER LIFE.  IF THE </p><p>PARTY PUSHES TOO HARD FOR CHANGE, THE GOVERNMENT WOULD SIMPLY SHUT </p><p>IT DOWN AND PROHIBIT ANY FURTHER OPPOSITION POLITICAL ACTIVITY. </p><p>THAT IS PRECISELY WHY, ACCORDING TO MAPOSA, THE MDC IS ORGANIZING </p><p>FEWER LARGE RALLIES -- WHICH WOULD ATTRACT ZANU-PF\'S ATTENTION AND </p><p>INVITE CONFRONTATION.  INSTEAD, THE MDC IS SENDING SMALL TEAMS </p><p>THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY TO CAMPAIGN DOOR-TO-DOOR.  THE TEAMS ARE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  01495  02 OF 03  021540Z </p><p>ADVISING PEOPLE TO DO EVERYTHING NECESSARY TO PROTECT THEMSELVES -- </p><p>BY AVOIDING CONFRONTATION WITH THE RULING PARTY AND TO ATTEND ZANU- </p><p>PF RALLIES AND WEAR ZANU-PF T-SHIRTS IF THEY MUST.  THE MDC IS </p><p>EXPENDING SIGNIFICANT EFFORT -- PARTICULARLY IN RURAL AREAS -- TO </p><p>CONVINCE VOTERS THAT THEIR BALLOT IS SECRET, DESPITE ZANU-PF\'S </p><p>CLAIMS TO THE CONTRARY.  THE OPPOSITION PARTY ALSO HAS BEGUN TO </p><p>DISTRIBUTE PAMPHLETS IN RURAL AREAS LAYING OUT ITS POSITIONS ON KEY </p><p>ISSUES. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) THE MDC LEADERSHIP HAS NOT AGREED HOW IT WOULD RESPOND IN </p><p>THE EVENT PRESIDENT MUGABE WINS A FRAUDULENT ELECTION, AN OUTCOME </p><p>MANY OBSERVERS CONSIDER INCREASINGLY LIKELY.  ASKED HOW THE PARTY </p><p>WOULD REACT IF MUGABE STEALS THE ELECTION, MAPOSA SEEMED TAKEN </p><p>ABACK AND DEFENSIVE.  AFTER A LONG PAUSE, HE ACKNOWLEDGED WEAKLY </p><p>ONLY THAT THERE HAD BEEN SOME INTERNAL DISCUSSION OF THE ISSUE.  HE </p><p>SAID THE PARTY HAS BEEN WORKING WITH KEY REGIONAL PLAYERS -- SOUTH </p><p>AFRICA AND BOTSWANA, IN PARTICULAR -- TO PRESS MUGABE ON THE </p><p>IMPORTANCE OF ENSURING THAT THE ELECTION IS "AS FREE AND FAIR AS IT </p><p>CAN BE."  MAPOSA ALSO EXPRESSED HOPE THAT THE UN MIGHT PROVIDE OR </p><p>COORDINATE THE PROVISION OF ELECTION MONITORS, AND INDICATED THAT </p><p>TSVANGIRAI MAY SEEK A MEETING WITH KOFI ANNAN TO DISCUSS THE ISSUE </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>IN AN UPCOMING VISIT TO THE UNITED STATES. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) MAKUMBE AGREED THAT AN ILLEGITIMATE MUGABE VICTORY IS THE </p><p>LIKELIEST SCENARIO IN 2002.  THE MDC\'S INCLINATION IN SUCH AN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ3231 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  01495  03 OF 03  021540Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  SMEC-00  DINT-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00   OIGO-00  FBIE-00 </p><p>      VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    L-00     VCE-00 </p><p>      AC-01    NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00 </p><p>      PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    IRM-00   STR-00   TRSE-00 </p><p>      USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-01   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00 </p><p>      SAS-00   SWCI-00    /009W </p><p>                  ------------------E675CB  021540Z /38 </p><p>P 021546Z MAY 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 8777 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 HARARE 001495 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL. 05/02/11 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, KDEM, PINS, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MDC CAMPAIGNING ACTIVELY BUT QUIETLY FOR PRESIDENCY, BUT </p><p>UNSURE HOW IT WOULD REACT TO MUGABE VICTORY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  01495  03 OF 03  021540Z </p><p> </p><p>EVENT, HE SAID, WAS TO "SCREAM TO THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY," AN </p><p>APPROACH THAT WOULD NOT BE PARTICULARLY PRODUCTIVE.  MAKUMBE HAS </p><p>INSTEAD URGED TSVANGIRAI AND OTHERS IN THE PARTY TO BE PREPARED TO </p><p>WORK WITH CIVIL SOCIETY IN ORGANIZING MASS ACTION TO PROTEST THE </p><p>OUTCOME.  MOST ZIMBABWEANS, MAKUMBE PREDICTED, WOULD BE VERY ANGRY </p><p>IN THE EVENT OF A MUGABE VICTORY, AND THE MDC MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO </p><p>PREVENT THE OUTBREAK OF BLOODY CONFRONTATIONS AROUND THE COUNTRY. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) THE INTERNAL RESTRUCTURING AND BETTER USE OF THE MEDIA HAVE </p><p>MADE THE MDC A STRONGER, MORE EFFECTIVE ORGANIZATION.  IN ADDITION, </p><p>THE MDC REMAINS OVERWHELMINGLY POPULAR IN URBAN AREAS AND APPEARS </p><p>TO BE MAKING INROADS IN SOME RURAL DISTRICTS, JUDGING FROM THE </p><p>INCREASE IN ATTENDANCE AT MANY OF THE PARTY\'S RALLIES.  THE </p><p>LEADERSHIP OF THE OPPOSITION PARTY, HOWEVER, IS MAKING A BIG </p><p>MISTAKE IN ASSUMING THAT THAT POPULARITY WILL TRANSLATE INTO </p><p>ELECTORAL TRIUMPH IN 2002.  MORGAN TSVANGIRAI WOULD ALMOST </p><p>CERTAINLY WIN AN ELECTION THAT IS CLOSE TO FREE AND FAIR, BUT </p><p>PRESIDENT MUGABE HAS STATED EXPLICITLY ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS -- MOST </p><p>RECENTLY IN PUBLIC REMARKS ON ZIMBABWE\'S INDEPENDENCE DAY ON APRIL </p><p>18 -- THAT HE WILL NEVER ALLOW THE MDC TO ASSUME POWER.   IT IS </p><p>TIME FOR THE MDC TO TAKE MUGABE AT HIS WORD, AND TO BEGIN TO DO </p><p>SOME SERIOUS CONTINGENCY PLANNING ABOUT WHAT STEPS IT WILL TAKE IF </p><p>THE PRESIDENT STEALS THE ELECTION. </p><p> </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01495  03 OF 03  021540Z </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
