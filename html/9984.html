(SBU) Summary: The new U.S. sanctions on Burma will have a </p><p>negative impact on the economy as a whole, and the garment </p><p>sector in particular.  NGOs believe that the unemployment </p><p>caused by the sharp decline of the garment industry will lead </p><p>to an increase of trafficking in persons and attempted </p><p>emigration.  However, the already massive flood of unemployed </p><p>young women and men seeking economic alternatives will likely </p><p>largely swallow this uptick.  Nonetheless, the U.S. </p><p>government should act quickly to ensure the activities of </p><p>NGOs providing outreach to potential and actual trafficking </p><p>victims are not diminished by the new sanctions.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>Sanctions Put a Bullet in Garment Sector </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) The new Burma sanctions, which among other </p><p>punishments ban imports of Burmese products into the United </p><p>States, are already beginning to have a visible impact on a </p><p>local garment sector already weakened by declining demand and </p><p>poor global competitiveness.  As reported in Refs A and F, </p><p>the predominately private sector-controlled Burmese garment </p><p>industry relies almost exclusively on the U.S. market, and </p><p>the garment manufacturers here have asserted that it will be </p><p>very difficult to replace U.S. customers with European Union </p><p>or Japanese buyers. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) With the garment sector collapse, we estimate that a </p><p>large percentage of the sector\'s estimated 100,000 jobs, </p><p>mostly in the Rangoon area, will be at risk.  In Burma\'s </p><p>dismal economy, these workers, mostly young women, some of </p><p>whom are the primary wage earner for their families, will </p><p>have very few positive economic prospects.  Certainly some </p><p>will be absorbed by the agricultural and informal economic </p><p>sector (selling tea or forest products in the marketplace). </p><p>Others will migrate to the vigorous karaoke and nightclub </p><p>sector of Rangoon to take jobs as hostesses and/or </p><p>prostitutes.  A third group, of indeterminate size, may head </p><p>for the borders to seek opportunities in Thailand or China. </p><p> </p><p>NGOs Uncertain Over Workers\' Future </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) According to international NGOs in Rangoon that work </p><p>to prevent trafficking in persons, the new sanctions will </p><p>likely cause an uptick in the number of women seeking to find </p><p>entertainment or sex industry jobs inside Burma, and sex and </p><p>manufacturing industry jobs over the border in Thailand and </p><p>China.  The NGO representatives admitted, though, that the </p><p>ranks of young, unemployed job seekers -- and cases of human </p><p>trafficking as a result -- will swell only slightly by the </p><p>closure of the garment factories.  Job brokers, both </p><p>legitimate and sinister, operating in Burma already benefit </p><p>from a huge supply of potential laborers due to the chronic </p><p>economic problems in Burma, and the relatively strong </p><p>currencies and economies of Thailand and China.  The NGOs </p><p>report that already brokers have increased their fees from </p><p>50,000 kyat (about $50) to 100,000 kyat.  The average garment </p><p>factory employee earns about 12,000-20,000 kyat/month </p><p>($12-$20/month). </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) NGOs are concerned about the paucity of legitimate </p><p>employment opportunities inside Burma for the former textile </p><p>workers and other young women.  One NGO told us as part of </p><p>its outreach program it previously assisted young women at </p><p>risk to get jobs at garment factories.  This will no longer </p><p>be an option.  NGOs do not foresee the government taking any </p><p>steps to create new jobs for young women.  In fact the </p><p>government\'s anti-trafficking watchdog, led by SPDC Secretary </p><p>One\'s wife, has announced a campaign to shut down all karaoke </p><p>shops and massage parlors (most of which do not offer sex); a </p><p>step that would cut off a major alternative to outright </p><p>prostitution for jobless girls and women. </p><p> </p><p>GOB Actions Indifferent </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Thus far, the government has done nothing to prepare </p><p>for, or soften, the impact of the factory closures.  Instead, </p><p>senior leaders and their journalistic mouthpieces have been </p><p>making political hay of the "weapon of mass destruction" </p><p>launched by the United States to cause "human rights abuses" </p><p>and force Burmese girls into "sexual slavery."  Garment </p><p>manufacturers tell us the government has ordered the factory </p><p>owners to pay all employees a severance package equal to </p><p>3-months salary.  However, it\'s yet unclear whether the </p><p>businessmen, already suffering from a 6-month banking crisis </p><p>and a generally poor business situation, will be able to make </p><p>these payments. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) The government also seems prepared to redouble </p><p>efforts to crack down on migration, particularly by women, </p><p>along the most traveled routes to the Thai and Chinese </p><p>borders.  However, NGOs fear, this type of interdiction will </p><p>only force would-be economic migrants to seek alternative, </p><p>more dangerous escape routes. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) It is always possible that the regime will take </p><p>administrative measures to sop up some of the new </p><p>unemployment, such as expanding public works projects or </p><p>forcing private investors to hire a certain number of new </p><p>employees.  However, we\'ve heard only hints and rumors of </p><p>this, and think it possible only if the unemployment begins </p><p>to cause some political ferment in the poorer parts of </p><p>Rangoon. </p><p> </p><p>Comment: Assistance Needed </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) While the Burmese government bears ultimate </p><p>responsibility for softening the economic blow to garment </p><p>sector workers, neighboring states and the U.S. government </p><p>should also look at ways of assisting those NGOs who are </p><p>aiding trafficked women and those at risk of being </p><p>trafficked.  There may be opportunities to contribute </p><p>additional U.S. aid to credible INGOs working independently </p><p>of the GOB in the area of trafficking.  However, the </p><p>immediate need is for a liberal general license, waiving </p><p>restrictions imposed by the latest sanctions, for those NGOs </p><p>that remit dollars into Burma.  Punctuating this need, on </p><p>August 8 twenty-six health, education, and environment NGOs </p><p>met with the DCM to complain that without a resolution of the </p><p>remittance problems, they would have to shut down their </p><p>operations within 2-3 weeks.  Indeed, many NGOs reported that </p><p>they were already cutting back their outreach because of the </p><p>inability to replenish funds. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
