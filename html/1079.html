<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 BOGOTA 003734 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 4/26/10 </p><p>TAGS:  PINS, PTER, MASS, PINR, PHUM, CO </p><p>SUBJECT: FARC INAUGURATES CLANDESTINE POLITICAL PARTY </p><p> </p><p>REFS: A) BOGOTA 3560  B) BOGOTA 3610 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR CURTIS W. KAMMAN, REASON 1.5(B). </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p>1. (C) AMIDST GREAT FANFARE AND TENS OF THOUSANDS OF </p><p>ONLOOKERS, THE FARC ANNOUNCED APRIL 29 ITS "CLANDESTINE </p><p>POLITICAL PARTY," THE "BOLIVARIAN MOVEMENT."  FARC CHIEF </p><p>MARULANDA SAID THE CLANDESTINE CHARACTER OF THE PARTY WAS </p><p>INTENDED TO PROTECT ITS MEMBERS FROM A SYSTEMATIC MURDER </p><p>CAMPAIGN SUCH AS THAT WHICH BEFELL THE U.P. IN THE </p><p>1980\'S.  ALL WHO SHARE THE FARC\'S THINKING, WHETHER OR </p><p>NOT THEY APPROVE OF ITS ARMED STRUGGLE, ARE WELCOME TO </p><p>JOIN, SAID PARTY DIRECTOR AND FARC SECRETARIAT MEMBER </p><p>ALFONSO CANO.  THE PARTY\'S PLATFORM IS RURAL </p><p>POPULIST/COMMUNIST.  THE INAUGURATION OF THE PARTY MAY BE </p><p>INTENDED TO GATHER POLITICAL SUPPORT FOR THE UNPOPULAR </p><p>GUERRILLA MOVEMENT; COULD BE PART OF AN EFFORT TO </p><p>INSTITUTIONALIZE FARC CONTROL OF AREAS UNDER ITS </p><p>INFLUENCE; OR MAY BE A DIVERSION TO UNDERMINE SUPPORT FOR </p><p>THE MILITARY COMPONENT OF PLAN COLOMBIA.  AT ABOUT THE </p><p>SAME TIME CANO INAUGURATED THE PARTY, FARC MILITARY </p><p>COMMANDER BRICENO REPORTEDLY ORDERED HIS TROOPS TO STEP </p><p>UP WAR ACTIONS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MARULANDA ANNOUNCES COMMUNIST, CLANDESTINE PARTY </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>2.  (U) ACCORDING TO PRESS REPORTS, THE FARC TRUCKED IN </p><p>TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE FROM AROUND PUTUMAYO, </p><p>CAQUETA, AND HUILA DEPARTMENTS TO WITNESS THE APRIL 29 </p><p>INAUGURATION OF ITS POLITICAL PARTY, THE BOLIVARIAN </p><p>MOVEMENT ("MOVIMIENTO BOLIVARIANO"), AT SAN VICENTE DEL </p><p>CAGUAN, IN ITS DESPEJE (DEMILITARIZED ZONE).  A PARADE OF </p><p>FARC COMBATANTS, THE LAUNCHING OF 50,000 BALLOONS, A </p><p>BARBECUE OF 400 HEAD OF CATTLE, AND A "VALLENATO" MUSIC </p><p>CONCERT ROUNDED OUT THE DAY\'S ACTIVITIES.  BEFORE AN </p><p>ENTHUSIASTIC, ASSAULT RIFLE-TOTING CROWD OF THOUSANDS, </p><p>FARC LEADER MANUEL MARULANDA ("TIROFIJO") ANNOUNCED THAT </p><p>THE PARTY WOULD, FOR THE TIME BEING, REMAIN CLANDESTINE. </p><p>SPEAKING BEFORE A LARGE, PUBLIC CROWD, MARULANDA SAID THE </p><p>ANONYMITY OF THE MOVEMENT\'S MEMBERS WAS NECESSARY TO </p><p>AVOID THE FATE OF THE "UNION PATRIOTICA."  (NOTE: 2,000 - </p><p>3,000 MEMBERS OF THE PATRIOTIC UNION, A LEGAL, LEFTIST </p><p>POLITICAL PARTY PRINCIPALLY CONSTITUTED BY THE FARC AND </p><p>THE COLOMBIAN COMMUNIST PARTY, WERE MURDERED IN THE MID- </p><p>AND LATE-1980\'S.  AS A SURVIVAL TACTIC, THE UP FORMALLY </p><p>SEVERED ITS LINKS TO THE FARC IN THE LATE 1980\'S.  MUCH </p><p>DEBILITATED, IT STILL EXISTS TODAY.  END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CANO PRESENTS PARTY PLATFORM </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>3.  (C) MARULANDA INTRODUCED FARC SECRETARIAT MEMBER </p><p>ALFONSO CANO AS THE PARTY\'S DIRECTOR.  (NOTE: CANO IS THE </p><p>FARC\'S PREMIER POLITICO, AND RECENTLY HAS HAD LITTLE </p><p>INVOLVEMENT IN EITHER THE PEACE PROCESS OR THE FARC\'S </p><p>MILITARY OFFENSIVES.  HE WAS THE FARC\'S CHIEF NEGOTIATOR </p><p>FOR THE UNSUCCESSFUL PEACE TALKS WITH THE GAVIRIA </p><p>GOVERNMENT, 1990-1993.  END NOTE.)  CANO SAID THE PARTY </p><p>ASPIRED TO NATIONAL POLITICAL POWER, AND THAT SOME OF ITS </p><p>MEMBERS WOULD COMPETE CLANDESTINELY IN THE OCTOBER </p><p>MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS.  THE PARTY WOULD PROVIDE "AN </p><p>ALTERNATIVE TO COLOMBIA\'S CORRUPT, TRADITIONAL POLITICAL </p><p>ELITES, AND WOULD BE OPEN TO ALL PERSONS WHO IDENTIFY </p><p>WITH THE FARC\'S THINKING, IF NOT WITH ITS ARMED STRUGGLE </p><p>. . .  AND WHO ARE NOT ENEMIES OF THE STATE (I.E., </p><p>PARAMILITARIES, CORRUPT POLITICIANS)." </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) CANO OUTLINED A RURAL POPULIST/COMMUNIST </p><p>PLATFORM, WHICH FOCUSSED ON EXTENDING BASIC SERVICES TO </p><p>RURAL AREAS.  HE PROPOSED STRONG STATE INTERVENTION IN </p><p>THE ECONOMY, AGRARIAN REFORM, AND AN AUTARKIC ECONOMY </p><p>WHICH WOULD REMAIN CLOSED TO "THE EMPIRE" (I.E., THE </p><p>UNITED STATES).  CANO CALLED FOR SPECIAL RECOGNITION AND </p><p>TREATMENT OF BLACK AND INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES.  HE </p><p>CHARACTERIZED THE PARTY AS THE MANIFESTATION OF THE </p><p>FARC\'S PREFERENCE FOR POLITICAL, RATHER THAN ARMED, </p><p>STRUGGLE.  HOWEVER, SHOULD THE USG AND THE GOC CONTINUE </p><p>CURRENT POLICIES, CANO SAID THE FARC WOULD BE LEFT NO </p><p>CHOICE BUT TO GIVE PRIORITY TO ARMED STRUGGLE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NOT A NEW INITIATIVE </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>5.  (U) CANO SAID THE FARC FOUNDED THE BOLIVARIAN </p><p>MOVEMENT IN 1996, WHEN IT BEGAN FORMING CELLS IN HIGH </p><p>SCHOOLS, UNIVERSITIES, FACTORIES AND ELSEWHERE.  THE </p><p>ELECTION OF THE PARTY\'S GOVERNING BOARD, THE "BOLIVARIAN </p><p>PATRIOTIC COUNCIL, COMPOSED OF 100 WELL-KNOWN </p><p>COLOMBIANS," WOULD SOON FOLLOW.  (NOTE: THE FARC HAS </p><p>PUBLICLY ANNOUNCED THE EXISTENCE OF THE BOLIVARIAN </p><p>MOVEMENT ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS, BUT NEVER WITH SO MUCH </p><p>FANFARE.  THE MOVEMENT HAS ALTERNATIVELY BEEN DESCRIBED </p><p>AS AN "INTELLECTUAL CADRE" FOR THE FARC.  ITS FORMATION </p><p>WAS FIRST CALLED FOR AT THE FARC\'S EIGHTH PLENARY </p><p>CONGRESS IN 1993.  COLOMBIAN LAW PROSCRIBES MEMBERSHIP IN </p><p>THE FARC AND SEVERAL OTHER ORGANIZATIONS; THE LEGALITY OF </p><p>MEMBERSHIP IN THE BOLIVARIAN MOVEMENT IS SO FAR UNCLEAR. </p><p>END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(C) DID THE NINTH PLENARY OCCUR? </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>6.  (C) THE LAUNCHING OF THE BOLIVARIAN MOVEMENT MAY NOT </p><p>HAVE BEEN THE ONLY BIG FARC GATHERING IN THE DESPEJE IN </p><p>RECENT WEEKS: THE FARC\'S NINTH PLENARY MEETING WAS </p><p>SCHEDULED FOR MARCH OR APRIL 2000.  AT THESE RARE, MAJOR </p><p>GATHERINGS OF FARC FRONT COMMANDERS, PLANS AND POLICIES </p><p>FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS ARE SET.  HOWEVER, EMBASSY HAS </p><p>BEEN UNABLE TO CONFIRM WHETHER THE NINTH PLENARY </p><p>MEETING IN FACT OCCURRED. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>WHILE CANO TALKS POLITICS, JOJOY TALKS WAR </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>7.  (U) BOGOTA PRESS PUBLISHED APRIL 29 A RADIO ADDRESS </p><p>BY FARC MILITARY LEADER JORGE BRICENO (AKA, "MONO JOJOY") </p><p>TO HIS TROOPS.  THE ADDRESS WAS REPORTEDLY INTERCEPTED BY </p><p>ARMY INTELLIGENCE.  BRICENO SAID, "THIS IS OUR BASIC </p><p>TENET: WE MUST ATTACK, KIDNAP, FLAY; THAT IS, STRIP THE </p><p>ENEMIES OF THE REVOLUTION OF THEIR MONEY."  HE CALLED FOR </p><p>USING THE RESPITE PROVIDED BY THE PEACE TALKS TO DOUBLE </p><p>THE NUMBER OF FARC COMBATANTS, "FROM 16,000 TO 32,000." </p><p>HE CALLED ON FARC MEMBERS TO CONTINUE THE FIGHT: "SOME OF </p><p>OUR PEOPLE WILL DO SO IN KEEPING WITH THE CONSTITUTION BY </p><p>ACTING IN AN OPEN FASHION AND OTHERS WILL WORK ON THE </p><p>FRINGES OF THE LAW BY USING WEAPONS."  REGARDING THE </p><p>BOLIVARIAN MOVEMENT, BRICENO REPORTEDLY SAID IT WOULD BE </p><p>WELCOMED "SO LONG AS THEY CONSTRUCT A PARTY FOR WAR." </p><p>REGARDING THE OCTOBER ELECTIONS, BRICENO SAID, "BALLOT </p><p>BOXES MUST BE BURNED AND EVERYTHING DESTROYED . . .  AND </p><p>WHEN THE GOVERNMENT POLITICIANS COME, WHETHER LIBERAL OR </p><p>CONSERVATIVE, WE WILL TAKE THEM PRISONER."  WHEN </p><p>CONFRONTED BY A JOURNALIST WITH BRICENO\'S UNTIMELY </p><p>REMARKS, CANO SAID HE WAS UNFAMILIAR WITH THEM, AND </p><p>ATTRIBUTED THEM TO ARMY DISINFORMATION. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p>8.  (C) BY FORMALLY LAUNCHING THE BOLIVARIAN MOVEMENT, </p><p>THE FARC IS MAKING ITS FIRST FORAY INTO PARTY POLITICS IN </p><p>15 YEARS.  THE CLANDESTINE CHARACTER OF THE PARTY IS, AS </p><p>MARULANDA SAID, A REACTION TO THE 1980\'S MURDERS OF UP </p><p>MEMBERS.  SO WHY THIS, AND WHY NOW?  DOUBTLESS, THE FARC </p><p>IS TRYING TO STEAL BACK THE SPOTLIGHT FROM THE ELN, WHICH </p><p>HAS BEEN THE FOCUS OF MUCH ATTENTION LATELY (REF A). </p><p>GIVEN THE CONGRESSIONAL CRISIS AND WIDESPREAD </p><p>DISENCHANTMENT WITH TRADITIONAL PARTIES, THE TIME SEEMS </p><p>RIPE TO LAUNCH (OR RE-LAUNCH) A POLITICAL PARTY -- FORMER </p><p>BOGOTA MAYOR ANTANAS MOCKUS JUST DID IT, AND SO DID THE </p><p>LABOR UNIONS.  THE FARC KNOWS LACK OF REAL POLITICAL </p><p>SUPPORT IS ITS ACHILLES\' HEEL, AND IS TRYING TO RECRUIT </p><p>SOME.  ALSO, SEVERAL DEVELOPMENTS -- THE FARC\'S RECENT </p><p>ANNOUNCEMENT OF NEW "TAXES" NATIONWIDE AND A SEPARATE, </p><p>REVOLUTIONARY JUSTICE SYSTEM FOR THE DESPEJE, AS WELL AS </p><p>THE INAUGURATION OF THE BOLIVARIAN MOVEMENT -- LEAD US TO </p><p>BELIEVE THE FARC IS TRYING TO INSTITUTIONALIZE CONTROL </p><p>OVER THE MUNICIPALITIES UNDER ITS SWAY.  FINALLY, THE </p><p>FARC FEARS USG MILITARY ASSISTANCE TO THE GOC.  BY </p><p>ENGAGING IN CEASE-FIRE TALKS (BEGUN APRIL 27, REF B) AND </p><p>SUPPOSEDLY PURSUING POWER VIA ITS NEW POLITICAL PARTY, </p><p>THE FARC MAY BE TRYING TO UNDERMINE POLITICAL SUPPORT FOR </p><p>THE MILITARY COMPONENT OF PLAN COLOMBIA. </p><p> </p><p>KAMMAN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
