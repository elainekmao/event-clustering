(SBU) POPE JOHN PAUL II SENT VETERAN VATICAN DIPLOMAT </p><p>CARDINAL PIO LAGHI TO JERUSALEM MAY 30. THE FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTRY\'S MIDDLE EAST DESK OFFICER, MONSIGNOR GIOVANNI </p><p>D\'ANIELLO, ACCOMPANIED LAGHI. IN AN OFFICIAL STATEMENT THE </p><p>VATICAN ANNOUNCED THAT THE ENVOYS WERE TO MEET WITH ISRAELI </p><p>PM SHARON AND PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY PRESIDENT ARAFAT AND </p><p>THAT THEY WOULD PRESENT THE TWO LEADERS WITH A PERSONAL </p><p>LETTER FROM THE POPE CALLING FOR A CEASE-FIRE AND RENEWED </p><p>DIALOGUE. (NOTE: CARDINAL LAGHI IS IN SEMI-RETIREMENT IN </p><p>VATICAN CITY.

(SBU) TWO EASTERN RITE CARDINALS COMMENTED THAT THEIR </p><p>CHURCHES SHOULD ACT AS MEDIATORS FOR ANY RAPPROCHEMENT WITH </p><p>THE ORTHODOX CHURCH. VATICAN OFFICIAL CARDINAL IGNACE MOUSSA </p><p>I DAOUD AND UKRAINE\'S CARDINAL LUBOMYR HUSAR OPINED THAT </p><p>THEIR EASTERN RITE CATHOLIC CHURCHES COULD HELP THE ORTHODOX </p><p>UNDERSTAND THE WEST AND VISA VERSA. (COMMENT: THE CANON LAW </p><p>FOR EASTERN CHURCHES INSISTS ON THE PRIMACY OF PAPAL </p><p>AUTHORITY IN ALL MATTERS OF DOCTRINE, DISCIPLINE AND </p><p>GOVERNANCE. UNLESS ROME DOES AN ABOUT FACE, IT IS DIFFICULT </p><p>TO IMAGINE THE ORTHODOX CHURCHES MOVING CLOSER TOWARDS </p><p>RESOLVING THEIR MISTRUST OF REAL OR IMAGINED INTENTIONS OF </p><p>ROMAN CATHOLICISM. DAOUD AND HUSAR\'S OPTIMISM MAY HAVE BEEN </p><p>MORE A PR EXERCISE AHEAD OF THE PAPAL VISIT TO UKRAINE THAN </p><p>AN ASSESSMENT OF THE REAL STATE OF RELATIONS WITH THE </p><p>ORTHODOX. END COMMENT). </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>NUTRITION AN ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL RIGHT </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.   (U) THE VATICAN DELEGATE AT A UN FOOD AND AGRICULTURE </p><p>ORGANIZATION MEETING HAS ARGUED THAT "THE RIGHT TO NUTRITION </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  02955  01 OF 02  012330Z </p><p>IS FULLY AN ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL RIGHT." ARCHBISHOP AGOSTINO </p><p>MARCHETTO, PERMANENT OBSERVER TO FAO, WENT ON TO SAY THAT </p><p>THE LACK OF SECURE ACCESS TO ADEQUATE FOOD IS ONE OF THE </p><p>MOST SEVERE LIMITATIONS ON HUMAN FREEDOM AND THE DEVELOPMENT </p><p>OF COMMUNITIES. THE REPRESENTATIVE SAID THAT THE HOLY SEE IS </p><p>"PROFOUNDLY DISAPPOINTED" BY LACK OF PROGRESS SINCE THE 1996 </p><p>WORLD FOOD SUMMIT. HE REGRETTED THAT WORLD LEADERS AND </p><p>DEVELOPED NATIONS HAD NOT TAKEN STEPS TO ENSURE ADEQUATE </p><p>FOOD SUPPLIES FOR NEEDY PEOPLE. DURING A TIME OF </p><p>"UNPRECEDENTED PROGRESS AND DEVELOPMENT," HE SAID, IT IS A </p><p>SCANDAL THAT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE REMAIN HUNGRY. HE REMINDED </p><p>MEETING PARTICIPANTS OF THE CORE OBLIGATIONS IN REGARD TO </p><p>FOOD SECURITY - TO ENSURE ACCESS TO THE MINIMUM ESSENTIAL </p><p>FOOD WHICH IS NUTRITIONALLY ADEQUATE AND SAFE, TO ENSURE </p><p>FREEDOM FROM HUNGER FOR EVERYONE. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER SAYS PAPAL TRIP TO UKRAINE NOT A THREAT </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ4911 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        VATICA  02955  02 OF 02  012331Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AGRE-00  AID-00   CIAE-00  DODE-00  WHA-00   SRPP-00 </p><p>      DS-00    EB-00    UTED-00  VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00 </p><p>      IO-00    L-00     AC-01    NEA-00   NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OIC-02 </p><p>      OMB-01   PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00 </p><p>      SS-00    STR-00   TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00 </p><p>      PRM-01   DRL-02   G-00     SAS-00     /008W </p><p>                  ------------------F38BEE  012331Z /75 </p><p>R 011443Z JUN 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY VATICAN </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 0000 </p><p>INFO EUROPEAN POLITICAL COLLECTIVE </p><p>AMEMBASSY GUATEMALA </p><p>AMEMBASSY TEL AVIV </p><p>AMCONSUL JERUSALEM </p><p>AMEMBASSY YEREVAN </p><p>AMEMBASSY ALMATY </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 02 VATICAN 002955 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPT.

(U) VATICAN FM JEAN-LOUIS TAURAN DEFENDED THE JUNE 23- </p><p>27 PAPAL VISIT TO UKRAINE AS A "PILGRIMAGE" THAT SHOULD NOT </p><p>ALARM THEN RUSSIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH. IN A PRESS CONFERENCE </p><p>MARKING THE TENTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE RE-ESTABLISHMENT OF THE </p><p>CATHOLIC CHURCH IN RUSSIA, ARCHBISHOP TAURAN SAID THAT THE </p><p>80 MILLION MEMBERS OF THE ORTHODOX CHURCH IN THAT COUNTRY </p><p>SHOULD NOT FEEL THREATENED BY A MERE 50,000 CATHOLICS. </p><p>TAURAN SAID THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IN RUSSIA WAS NOT IN THE </p><p>BUSINESS OF PROSELYTISM OR PROPAGANDA. (NOTE: RUSSIAN </p><p>POLITICIANS AND ORTHODOX CHURCH LEADERS ARE SPEAKING OUT </p><p>WITH INCREASING REGULARITY AGAINST THE PAPAL VISIT TO </p><p>NEIGHBORING UKRAINE. OPPONENTS SUSPECT THE UKRAINE TRIP IS A </p><p>VATICAN PLAN TO EXPAND CATHOLIC INFLUENCE IN TERRITORY WHICH </p><p>THE RUSSIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH CONSIDERS ITS EXCLUSIVE DOMAIN. </p><p>END NOTE). TAURAN TRIED TO ALLAY THE FEARS, DESCRIBING THE </p><p>VISITS AS "A RELIGIOUS EVENT AND A PILGRIMAGE." HE SAID IT </p><p>IS EXACTLY WHAT THE POPE WOULD LIKE TO DO IN RUSSIA. </p><p>HOWEVER, THE MOSCOW PATRIARCHATE HAS ALREADY DECLARED THAT </p><p>RELATIONS WITH ROME WILL WORSEN IF THE POPE MEETS WITH </p><p>UKRAINIAN ORTHODOX LEADERS WHOM THE PATRIARCHATE CONSIDERS </p><p>TO BE IN SCHISM. SOME OF THOSE LEADERS BELONG TO UKRAINE\'S </p><p>COUNCIL OF CHURCHES AND ARE EXPECTED TO PARTICIPATE IN AN </p><p>ECUMENICAL MEETING WITH JOHN PAUL II. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>POPE WANTS JUSTICE IN GUATEMALA </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  02955  02 OF 02  012331Z </p><p>6.   (U) POPE JOHN PAUL II WANTS SOCIAL JUSTICE AND THE </p><p>RESOLUTION OF THE "EXECRABLE CRIMES" OF THE PAST IN </p><p>GUATEMALA. HE WAS SPEAKING TO A GROUP OF GUATEMALAN BISHOP </p><p>MAKING THEIR FIVE YEARLY BRIEFING VISIT TO VATICAN CITY. THE </p><p>POPE SAID GUATEMALA "HAS WITNESSED THE SHEDDING OF BLOOD OF </p><p>TOO MANY CHILDREN." HE ADDED IT WAS IMPORTANT TO REVIVE THE </p><p>MEMORY OF THOSE WHO LOST THEIR LIVES IN THE COUNTRY\'S CIVIL </p><p>WAR. IN HIS RESPONSE, THE PRESIDENT OF THE GUATEMALAN </p><p>BISHOPS CONFERENCE, ARCHBISHOP VICTOR HUGO MARTINEZ </p><p>CONTERARAS OF LOS ALTOS QUETZALTENANGO-TOTONICAPAN, SAID HIS </p><p>COUNTRY\'S SOCIETY WAS TROUBLED BY "VIOLENCE, ORGANIZED </p><p>CRIME, DRUG TRAFFIC AND CORRUPTION." AFTER 36 YEARS OF CIVIL </p><p>WAR, HE ADDED, "THE PEOPLE OF GUATEMALA HAVE LOST ALL </p><p>CONFIDENCE IN POLITICAL INVOLVEMENT." HE SAID THAT IN ORDER </p><p>TO REGAIN THE PEOPLE\'S CONFIDENCE THE GOVERNMENT MUST CALL </p><p>TO ACCOUNT THE PERPETRATORS OF CRIMINAL VIOLENCE AND </p><p>SPECIFICALLY MENTIONED THE MURDER OF BISHOP JUAN GERARDI. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>PAPAL TRAVEL UPDATE - ARMENIA, KAZAKHSTAN, BULGARIA </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>7.   (U) THE VATICAN ANNOUNCED MAY 31 THAT POPE JOHN PAUL II </p><p>WILL TRAVEL TO ARMENIA AND KAZAKHSTAN IN SEPTEMBER, HIS </p><p>FIRST TRIP TO EITHER COUNTRY. THE VISIT TO ARMENIA HAS BEEN </p><p>LONG EXPECTED AND WILL FEATURE THE POPE\'S PRESENCE AT EVENTS </p><p>MARKING 1700 YEARS OF CHRISTIANITY IN THE COUNTRY.
