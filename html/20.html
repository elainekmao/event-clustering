PROBLEMS CONNECTED WITH THEIR APPLI- </p><p>CATIONS FOR REFUGEE STATUS ARE REPORTED SEPTEL.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  ON JANUARY 4, TWO ANGOLAN MEMBERS OF THE SADF\'S 32ND- </p><p>BATTALION "BUFFALO COMPANY," CAME TO THE EMBASSY SEEKING REFUGEE </p><p>STATUS AND INQUIRING ABOUT THE AMERICAN RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM </p><p>(SEPTEL).  THE TWO FAMILIES TOTAL 15 PEOPLE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  THE MEN, JOAO FAUSTINO SALES AND LASERU NHUKWETE, CLAIMED </p><p>THAT THEY AND THEIR FAMILIES HAD FLED SOUTHERN ANGOLA IN THE </p><p>DEBACLE OF 1976, SALES FROM SA DA BANDIERA (NOW LUBANGO) AND </p><p>NHUKWETE FROM LUIMBALE (NEAR HUAMBO).  BOTH MEN SUPPORTED FNLA, </p><p>SALES BEING RESPONSIBLE FOR COORDINATING FOOD AND GUNS FOR THE </p><p>FNLA. </p><p> </p><p>5.  FROM 1976 TO 1978, THE FAMILIES REPORTEDLY LIVED IN AN </p><p>ANGOLAN REFUGEE CAMP NEAR RUNDU ON THE ANGOLAN-NAMIBIAN BORDER; </p><p>ANOTHER ANGOLAN REFUGEE CAMP WAS LOCATED FURTHER EAST IN THE </p><p>CAPRIVI.  IN 1978, THE SOUTH AFRICANS GAVE THE REFUGEES TWO OPTIONS: </p><p>THEY COULD JOIN THE SADF, OR BE RETURNED TO ANGOLA.  THE </p><p>REFUGEE CAMPS WERE TO BE DESTROYED.  SALES AND NHUKWETE JOINED </p><p>THE SADF AND ENDED UP AS TEACHERS FOR ANGOLAN CHILDREN OF OTHER </p><p>RECRUITS.  SALES TAUGHT PORTUGUESE AND NHUKWETE SCIENCE.  SALES </p><p>HELD RANK OF LANCE CORPORAL AND NHUKWETE CORPORAL. </p><p>6.  ACCORDING TO SALES AND NHUKWETE, THE 32ND BATTALION IS </p><p>COMPOSED COMPLETELY OF ANGOLANS, UNTIL 1978 ALL FNLA SUPPORTERS. </p><p>SINCE THEN, A NUMBER OF UNITA SUPPORTERS AND "APOLITICAL" </p><p>ANGOLANS HAVE ALSO JOINED THE 32ND.  WHILE THE ENLISTED MEN ARE </p><p>BLACK ANGOLANS, THE OFFICERS ARE WHITE SOUTH AFRICANS, WHO ARE </p><p>EORCED TO LEARN PORTUGESE IN ORDER TO COMMUNICATE.  (SALES AND </p><p>NHUKWETE SPOKE PASSABLE ENGLISH, BUT FELT MORE COMFORTABLE </p><p>TALKING IN PORTUGUESE WITH THE EMBASSY\'S REFUGEE OFFICER.) </p><p> </p><p>7.  IN NOVEMBER 1983, THE MEN SAID THAT "SOUTH AFRICAN </p><p>INTELLIGENCE" OFFICERS ENCOURAGED THE FOUNDING IN WINDHOEK OF A </p><p>GROUP CALLED "THE SOCIO-CULTURAL ASSOCIATION OF ANGOLANS IN </p><p>SOUTH WEST AFRICA."  THE CURRENT PRESIDENT OR NATIONAL CHAIRMAN </p><p>OF THE ORGANIZATION IS ALLEGEDLY TIMOTYO VICTOR, A UNITA </p><p>SYMPATHIZER.  THE NEW ORGANIZATION WAS INTRODUCED TO THE </p><p>ANGOLANS AT RUNDU BY A COL. VILJOEN (WHOSE NICKNAME IS </p><p>"FANAKOLO," THE NAME GIVEN TO THE LANGUAGE USED IN SOUTH AFRICAN </p><p>MINES, SINCE VILJOEN ALLEGEDLY WORKED IN THE MINES BEFORE JOINING </p><p>THE SADF).  THE PRESIDENT OF THE RUNDU BRANCH IS JOAO APOLINARIO </p><p>WHILE NHUKWERE WAS VICE-PRESIDENT AND SALES SECRETARY. </p><p>ACCORDING TO A COPY OF THE SPEECH GIVEN BY THE COMMANDING </p><p>OFFICER (EMBASSY HAS ENGLISH COPY WHICH WILL BE FORWARDED TO </p><p>AF/S), THE PURPOSE OF THE REORGANIZATION IS "TO PROMOTE </p><p>FRIENDLY CULTURAL TIES AMONGST MEMBERS OF THE ANGOLAN COMMUNITY </p><p>IN SWA...TO MEET FELLOW SOLDIERS AND CIVILIANS OF WINDHOEK, </p><p>TSUMEB, KATIMA MULILO, AND RUNDU AT SOCCER MATCHES AND OTHER </p><p>SPORTS EVENTS."  EVERYONE WHO IS A "TRUE ANGOLAN" WAS EN- </p><p>COURAGED TO JOIN THE ORGANIZATION. </p><p> </p><p>8.  IN NOVEMBER 1984, AN EXECUTIVE MEETING OF THE ORGANIZATION </p><p>WAS HELD IN WINDHOEK AND ATTENDED BY ALL BRANCH LEADERS AND </p><p>A LARGE NUMBER OF SADF OFFICERS OF COLONEL RANK OR HIGHER, </p><p>ALL BELIEVED BY THE ANGOLANS TO BE FROM SADF INTELLIGENCE.  THE </p><p>ANGOLANS WERE TOLD THAT THE "FIRST PHASE" OF THE PROGRAM HAD </p><p>BEEN COMPLETED AND THEY COULD MOVE ON TO THE "SECOND PHASE."  THE MEN </p><p>RECEIVED A LECTURE ON THE DANGERS AND THREAT OF COMMUNISM </p><p>IN THE AREA AND WERE TOLD THAT ELECTIONS WOULD SOON TAKE PLACE </p><p>IN NAMIBIA; THE ELECTIONS WOULD BE FOUGHT BETWEEN THE INTERNAL </p><p>PARTIES AND SWAPO.  THE TWO MEN FELT THAT THEIR ORGANIZATION </p><p>WAS BEING POLITICIZED AND THEY WERE BEING PREPARED TO TAKE </p><p>PART IN AN ANTI-SWAPO CAMPAIGN IN NAMIBIA.  AT THE SAME TIME, THE </p><p>ANGOLANS WERE TOLD THAT THE SADF WOULD LEAVE SOUTHWEST AFRICA </p><p>AND RETURN TO SOUTH AFRICA; THE ANGOLANS IN THE SADF WOULD BE </p><p>ALLOWED TO RETURN TO SOUTH AFRICA WITH THEM, BUT NOTHING WAS </p><p>SAID ABOUT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN AFTER THAT. </p><p> </p><p>9.  SALES AND NHUKWETE THEN REPORTEDLY DECIDED THAT THEY HAD A DIM </p><p>FUTURE IN THE SADF AND DECIDED TO SEEK REFUGE IN BOTSWANA.  THEY </p><p>OBTAINED TRAVEL DECUMENTS, TOOK OFFICIAL LEAVE FROM THE SADF, AND </p><p>TRAVELLED THROUGH THE CAPRIVI TO KATIMA MULILO, CROSSED INTO </p><p>ZAMBIA, AND THENCEOINTO BOTSWANA AT KAZUNGULA.  ACCORDING TO THE </p><p>MEN, THEIR LEAVE EXPIRED ON JANUARY 7. </p><p> </p><p>MAINO </p><p></p></div>
