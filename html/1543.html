(U) THE ZIMBABWE CONGRESS OF TRADE UNIONS (ZCTU) </p><p>FIVE-YEAR CONGRESS, HELD ON FEBRUARY 23 AND 24, RESULTED </p><p>IN THE ELECTION OF A NEW EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE AND AN </p><p>AFFIRMATION THAT THE FEDERATION IS NON-PARTISAN.  ALL </p><p>INDICATIONS ARE THAT THE CONGRESS WENT SMOOTHLY, AND </p><p>THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF AN OVERT EFFORT BY THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE (GOZ) AND ZANU-PF TO DIRECTLY </p><p>INFLUENCE EVENTS IN THE CONGRESS AND THE ELECTION OF THE </p><p>NEW LEADERSHIP.  THE FEBRUARY 26 ISSUE OF THE GOZ- </p><p>CONTROLLED "THE HERALD" REPORTED THAT THE NEW PRESIDENT </p><p>OF THE ZCTU, LOVEMORE MATAMBO, PROCLAIMED THAT THE LABOR </p><p>FEDERATION WAS "NOT ALIGNED TO ANY POLITICAL PARTY" AND </p><p>"WILL WORK WITH ANY POLITICIANS WHO ARE CONCERNED ABOUT </p><p>WORKERS\' WELFARE REGARDLESS OF POLITICAL AFFILIATION." </p><p>THIS IS AFTER THE OUTGOING SECRETARY-GENERAL OF THE </p><p>ZCTU, AND PRESIDENT OF THE OPPOSITION MOVEMENT FOR </p><p>DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC), MORGAN TSVANGIRAI, ADDRESSED </p><p>THE CONGRESS ON FEBRUARY 24 AND SAID THAT "ZCTU IS THE </p><p>SOUL OF THE MDC AND IF YOU REMOVE THE SOUL, THE PARTY </p><p>WILL DIE." </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00846  261505Z </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) THE FOLLOWING WERE ELECTED TO KEY POSITIONS IN </p><p>THE ZCTU EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE: </p><p> </p><p>= WILLARD CHIBHEBHE - SECRETARY-GENERAL </p><p> </p><p>= COLLEN GWIYO - FIRST DEPUTY SECRETARY-GENERAL </p><p> </p><p>= MIRIAM MUKUTUMA - SECOND SECRETARY-GENERAL </p><p> </p><p>= LOVEMORE MATAMBO - PRESIDENT </p><p> </p><p>= MATILDA CHEKUDA - TREASURER </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) COMMENT: WHILE IT IS STILL TOO EARLY TO DETERMINE </p><p>THE LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF THE CONGRESS ON THE </p><p>RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE ZCTU, THE MDC, AND ZANU-PF, OUR </p><p>EARLY READING IS THAT THE PRO-MDC ELEMENT IN THE ZCTU </p><p>WAS ABLE TO CARRY THE DAY.  WILLARD CHIBHEBHE, WHO WAS </p><p>ELECTED SECRETARY-GENERAL, THE MOST POWERFUL POSITION IN </p><p>THE EXECUTIVE, WAS MENTIONED TO US BY PRO-MDC LABOR </p><p>LEADERS GIFT CHIMANIKIRE AND ISAAC MATONGO PRIOR TO THE </p><p>CONGRESS AS ONE OF THEIR PREFERRED CANDIDATES FOR THAT </p><p>POSITION.  INDEED, ACCORDING TO SENIOR MDC ADVISOR GANDI </p><p>MUDZINGWA, CHIBHEBHE SERVED AS THE MDC\'S SECRETARY OF </p><p>POLICY AND RESEARCH IN 1999 AND IS DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE </p><p>FOR FORMULATING MANY OF THE PARTY\'S CURRENT POLICIES. </p><p>HIS ELECTION IS THUS A GOOD SIGN FOR CONTINUED </p><p>COOPERATION OR AT LEAST IDEOLOGICAL SUPPORT BETWEEN THE </p><p>ZCTU AND THE MDC, REGARDLESS OF THE LABOR ORGANIZATION\'S </p><p>PROCLAIMED NEUTRALITY.  THE PREVIOUS ACTING SECRETARY- </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00846  261505Z </p><p>GENERAL, ISIDORE ZINDOGA, WHO WAS WIDELY BELIEVED TO BE </p><p>PRO-ZANU-PF, WAS DEFEATED AND NOW HOLDS NO LEADERSHIP </p><p>POSITION IN THE ZCTU.  WE WILL BE MEETING IN THE NEAR </p><p>TERM WITH OUR LABOR CONTACTS TO GLEAN THE UNION AND </p><p>POLITICAL BACKGROUNDS OF THE NEW ZCTU EXECUTIVE.  WE </p><p>WILL ALSO SEEK A CLEARER READOUT OF WHAT THE WEEKEND\'S </p><p>VOTE MEANS FOR ZIMBABWE\'S WORKERS, AND THE RELATIONSHIP </p><p>BETWEEN THE ZCTU, THE OPPOSITION MDC, AND THE RULING </p><p>ZANU-PF.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
