<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 001374 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E for U/S LARSON AND ANN PENCE </p><p>EB/IFD/OMA FOR PREID </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, ECON, PREL, NI </p><p>SUBJECT:  DEBT SWAP FOR ENVIRONMENT CLEANUP INITIATIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF:  STATE 97771 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) Action request and comment at para 6. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) TDY U.S. Treasury Advisor Lisa Cook and </p><p>Economic Section Chief Stephen Carrig met June 11 with </p><p>GON debt management officials for a review of the </p><p>mechanics of a debt for environment clean-up swap </p><p>first discussed in Washington during President </p><p>Obasanjo\'s May 10-12 meetings with senior </p><p>Administration officials. Ambassador was present for </p><p>those meetings.  GON officials present for the </p><p>subsequent Abuja meeting included: Mr. Steve Oronsaye, </p><p>Principal Secretary to the President; Mr. A.S. </p><p>Arikawe, Director General, Debt Management Office; </p><p>Mrs. F.M. Yemidale, Deputy Director, Central Bank of </p><p>Nigeria (CBN); and several technical support staff </p><p>members. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) Ms. Cook made a thorough oral presentation of </p><p>the mechanics of a debt for clean-up swap.  She </p><p>provided a brief paper as well that outlined a typical </p><p>arrangement step-by-step.  The Nigerians, in </p><p>particular Yemidale, who has had eleven years of </p><p>experience in CBN debt swap programs, quickly warmed </p><p>to the proposal and engaged the U.S. side in a </p><p>discussion of its specifics.  The GON team concurred </p><p>in the USG observation that developing the proposal </p><p>would be a time-consuming and complex undertaking; </p><p>they volunteered that we should begin now. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Three sets of issues emerged immediately: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>a) GON concern that the first purchaser of the </p><p>dollar-denominated debt would receive the lion\'s share </p><p>of the discount by buying the debt low and selling it </p><p>(relatively) high, thus providing GON limited debt </p><p>relief.  Oronsaye was particularly concerned about </p><p>this issue.  USG replied that market dynamics, i.e., </p><p>financial community valuation of Nigerian paper, </p><p>indeed, would play an important role in the process, </p><p>but i) that would exist even without a swap </p><p>arrangement; ii) the GON discharge of dollar debt via </p><p>naira payment was clearly advantageous to Nigeria; and </p><p>iii) the swap enabled Nigeria to finance environmental </p><p>projects it already publicly had endorsed as </p><p>essential. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>b) GON concern that certain classes of project </p><p>financing might be excluded by definition.  Arikawe </p><p>asked, for example, whether committing the remaining </p><p>discounted debt to financing the construction of </p><p>facilities utilizing now-flared natural gas </p><p>commercially would qualify as sufficiently </p><p>"environmental" for the swap.  Oronsaye, </p><p>notwithstanding the potential caveat on excluding </p><p>infrastructure and poverty reduction uses mentioned in </p><p>Reftel para 5, observed that wholly environmental </p><p>programs would be acceptable to the GON.  Cook and </p><p>Carrig both noted that although definitions were </p><p>important, and there certainly would be a review, the </p><p>objective of the swap was to be inclusive of </p><p>environmental programs that were workable and </p><p>beneficial to all parties. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>c) GON concern over restrictions on the location </p><p>of acceptable projects or the "nationality" of third </p><p>party participants.  Oronsaye asked that projects not </p><p>be restricted to the Delta region; he noted that other </p><p>parts of the country, e.g., the southeast, had their </p><p>own serious environmental issues with erosion, for </p><p>example.  Yemidale asked whether other-than-U.S. </p><p>companies and NGOs would be eligible for the program. </p><p>USG replied that, in principle, environmental projects </p><p>country-wide could be eligible, provided they </p><p>otherwise qualified, and that there were no known </p><p>firms or NGOs ineligible ab initio. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) In a side-bar conversation with EconChief, </p><p>Oronsaye noted that the Delta surely would benefit </p><p>were projects undertaken, but that the GON, for </p><p>political reasons, necessarily would initiate needed </p><p>projects elsewhere as well.  He also said that the GON </p><p>already had "heard" that both Shell and Mobile were </p><p>interested in the swap potentials although, and as </p><p>noted in Reftel para 6, the GON initially would prefer </p><p>to deal directly with USG and only indirectly with </p><p>potential private sector participants.  Oronsaye </p><p>reiterated the GON team\'s earlier observation that we </p><p>should begin the process as soon as possible, thereby </p><p>maintaining the momentum gained by our two Presidents\' </p><p>interest in the proposal. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) Action Request and Comment.  Given the </p><p>cooperative and upbeat tenor of these initial debt </p><p>swap discussions with the GON at the working-level in </p><p>Abuja, Embassy strongly recommends -- and seeks </p><p>guidance regarding -- taking immediate next steps.  It </p><p>appears to us that Reftel\'s para 8 mention of </p><p>consultations with the Corporate Council on Africa </p><p>(CCA) to gauge oil company interest might be </p><p>complemented beneficially were we informally and </p><p>simultaneously to sound out the Nigeria-based field </p><p>headquarters.  Neither the international headquarters </p><p>nor the field elements could commit without </p><p>consultations among themselves.  USG could facilitate </p><p>this were Embassy and the debt swap IAWG liaison to </p><p>the CCA provided common talking points.  Similarly, it </p><p>would be helpful were there a generic set of common </p><p>talking points for use with NGOs.  Without any </p><p>discussions beyond those described here, we have </p><p>identified potential NGO participants and are prepared </p><p>to approach them as well on instruction.  End Action </p><p>Request and Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
