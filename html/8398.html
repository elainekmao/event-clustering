<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 001092 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PDPA FOR DALTON, MITCHELL AND SIMS </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION MASS ACTION IN ZIM; HARARE </p><p> </p><p>  1.   While editorials in the independent newspapers are in </p><p>      favor of the proposed week-long mass protests that are </p><p>      expected to begin in Zimbabwe today (June 2), called by the </p><p>      opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) to force </p><p>      Robert Mugabe to enter into a serious and genuine dialogue </p><p>      with the MDC to break the political and economic impasse </p><p>      gripping the country, the government-controlled print and </p><p>      electronic media is devoting acres of editorial space and </p><p>      airtime to calling for the arrest of the entire MDC </p><p>      leadership, and discouraging the people of Zimbabwe from </p><p>      participating in the marches and demonstrations.  Editorial </p><p>      excerpts follow: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   Under headline "The price of inertia" the independent </p><p>      daily "The Daily News" (06/02) comments: </p><p> </p><p>      "Today the MDC party begins a week of mass </p><p>      demonstrations. . .MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai and </p><p>      his party may or may not succeed in this onerous </p><p>      task they have set themselves.  But that the </p><p>      Zimbabwe crisis must now be resolved in the streets </p><p>      and possibly with innocent blood being shed in the </p><p>      process is a sad indictment against those to whom </p><p>      ordinary Zimbabweans and indeed millions of ordinary </p><p>      Africans look up to for leadership.  It would be an </p><p>      indictment against Mugabe personally if Zimbabwe </p><p>      burns in the days ahead. . .We can only hope that </p><p>      the events of this week will be clear enough to </p><p>      Mbeki, Obasanjo and Muluzi that they should stop </p><p>      shielding Mugabe.  And that instead they should </p><p>      convey the message that Zimbabweans by coming out </p><p>      into the streets are trying to put across to him and </p><p>      that is: for all the good he may have done for this </p><p>      country in the past he must step down in order to </p><p>      give this country a chance to start afresh and move </p><p>      forward." </p><p> </p><p>  3.   Under headline "Tsvangirai must pay for his sins" the </p><p>      government-controlled daily "The Herald" (06/02) comments: </p><p> </p><p>      "The time has now come for opposition MDC leader, </p><p>      Morgan Tsvangirai, to pay the price for his sins </p><p>      against the people of Zimbabwe and to show him that, </p><p>      like everyone else, he is not above the law. . .His </p><p>      unprecedented backing by the United States, Britain, </p><p>      some members of the European Union and the white </p><p>      Commonwealth has made him feel invincible and that </p><p>      no one can touch him no matter how many laws he </p><p>      breaks and how much suffering he has brought to bear </p><p>      on the people of Zimbabwe. . .Until his case is </p><p>      finalized, the MDC leader must be put into </p><p>      protective custody so that he does not further </p><p>      endanger the lives of innocent people who might be </p><p>      caught up in the crossfire of his reckless </p><p>      actions. . .It is now time to act and reassure </p><p>      Zimbabweans that everyone is equal before the law. . </p><p>      . ." </p><p> </p><p>  4.   Under headline "Enough is enough" a front-page </p><p>      editorial in the government-controlled "Chronicle" </p><p>      (06/02) comments: </p><p> </p><p>      "The High Court on Saturday outlawed MDC\'s planned </p><p>      mass action to oust President Mugabe\'s </p><p>      democratically elected government from power. . .If </p><p>      Tsvangirai and his thugs dare defy this lawful </p><p>      order, then they should face the full wrath of the </p><p>      law. . .We demand that police should move with speed </p><p>      and arrest the confused opposition leader and his </p><p>      cronies and throw the keys into the sea.   Enough is </p><p>      enough. . .We cannot tolerate lawlessness in the </p><p>      country because the perpetrator is backed by some </p><p>      foreign power that will condemn us for doing what is </p><p>      right.  Let the British and the Americans who have </p><p>      openly supported Tsvangirai\'s illegal statement and </p><p>      actions say whatever they want.  We cannot be </p><p>      bullied into allowing lawlessness because we are </p><p>      afraid of cowboys and gay gangsters. . .We demand </p><p>      that any and all that dare soil our streets with </p><p>      misguided marches must be thrown behind bars.  And </p><p>      we urge the courts to throw the full book at any one </p><p>      who will be arrested. . .We urge members of the </p><p>      public to show charlatans like Tsvangirai that they </p><p>      cherish the peace and tranquility by going about </p><p>      their business normally this entire week. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>  5.   Under headline "Road map for Zimbabwe" the independent </p><p>      weekly "The Daily News on Sunday" (06/02) comments: </p><p> </p><p>      ". . .The government would be well-advised to let </p><p>      the march proceeds uninterrupted, unless there is </p><p>      clear evidence of violence.  Interfering with such a </p><p>      road map could lead to a political dead-end for the </p><p>      country." </p><p> </p><p>  6.   In a front-page editorial under headline "Do or Die" </p><p>      the independent weekly "The Standard" (06/01) </p><p>      comments: </p><p> </p><p>      "The week we have just begun could mark a turning </p><p>      point in the 23-year history of independent Zimbabwe </p><p>      as ordinary citizens make the choice between the </p><p>      status quo and a new political dispensation.  It is </p><p>      a sad indictment those who have enjoyed the </p><p>      privilege of leading this country over the past 23 </p><p>      years that today, a once prosperous beacon of hope </p><p>      in Africa, has been reduced to another basket case </p><p>      in a much maligned continent. . .As Zimbabweans </p><p>      either march in their cities and towns or simply </p><p>      stay at home, it will not necessarily be about the </p><p>      removing the de facto President and the government </p><p>      from power but to say `Enough is Enough.\'  The tide </p><p>      of feeling about the tragedy that has gripped the </p><p>      country is running very high and this could be the </p><p>      opportunity for Zimbabweans to shake off a label now </p><p>      being bandied around - that we are a docile </p><p>      people. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>  7.   Under headline "The fire this time" a second editorial </p><p>      published on page 8 in the same edition comments: </p><p> </p><p>      ". . .This week\'s demonstrations are not the sort </p><p>      that split society and families.  Zimbabweans of all </p><p>      races and creeds fully support these peaceful </p><p>      marches and want to be fully involved in them and if </p><p>      uniformed forces try to mow down the marchers, they </p><p>      will be forgiven.  Be that as it may, Zimbabweans </p><p>      this week will prove equal to the challenge.  The </p><p>      demonstrations this time appear to usher a new </p><p>      Zimbabwe." </p><p> </p><p>  8.   Under headline "Defining moment for Zimbabweans" the </p><p>      government-controlled weekly "The Sunday Mail" </p><p>      (06/01) comments: </p><p> </p><p>      "We are praying and hoping that reason will prevail </p><p>      and Zimbabweans will not be mislead into backing the </p><p>      maneuvers by the opposition MDC to attempt to remove </p><p>      a constitutionally elected President by force.  This </p><p>      is a defining moment, not in the sense in which the </p><p>      opposition would want it to be, but in the sense </p><p>      that Zimbabweans have an opportunity to demonstrate </p><p>      their political maturity, and uphold the rule of </p><p>      law. . .Taking matters into their own hands would be </p><p>      foolish, as it would at best achieve nothing and at </p><p>      worst set the country up in flames.  While many </p><p>      would have views about how the political question </p><p>      should be resolved, we believe they should give the </p><p>      African mediators an opportunity to find common </p><p>      grounds around which national dialogue and hopefully </p><p>      national consensus could be built. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
