O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, ECON, EINV, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: Exporters Traverse Minefield </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary: Battered but unbowed, exporters in the </p><p>Eastern Zimbabwe town of Mutare are still hanging tough. </p><p>But how long can these resourceful industrialists </p><p>withstand a sub-market exchange rate, energy rationing </p><p>and political turmoil?  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Dogged Perseverance </p><p>------------------- </p><p>2. (SBU) While in Mutare April 7-8, Econchief visited </p><p>reps from 6 export firms, the timber association and the </p><p>local Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries (CZI).  Their </p><p>stubborn perseverance is admirable.  Beset by hostile </p><p>government, 221 percent inflation, power rationing, fuel </p><p>shortages, an overvalued Zimdollar and political </p><p>upheaval, these businesspeople still manage to wring </p><p>modest profits out of a nose-diving economy.  As </p><p>exporters, of course, they are spared the GOZ\'s domestic </p><p>price controls, operate on a more rational U.S. dollar- </p><p>based economy and benefit from Zimbabweans\' high-caliber </p><p>workmanship at bargain-basement US$ 10/month salaries. </p><p>But the challenges of doing business here are still </p><p>enormous. </p><p> </p><p>Power Rationing </p><p>--------------- </p><p>3. (SBU) Their most pressing concern is energy.  The </p><p>firms we spoke with are enduring 4-6 hours of outages </p><p>each day, double the norm in Harare.  The Managing </p><p>Director at PG Safety Glass, windshield supplier to the </p><p>U.S., said the slow process of restarting the glass- </p><p>heating process turns each 4-hour shut-down into an 8- </p><p>hour ordeal of lost work.  Power rationing has already </p><p>stretched the firm\'s delivery time from 3-to-7 weeks. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Meanwhile, energy parastatal ZESA is trying to </p><p>increase exponentially exporters\' monthly bills.  It just </p><p>raised Mutare Board and Paper Mills from Z$ 20 to 450 </p><p>million, PG Safety Glass Z$ 3 to 90 million and Border </p><p>Timbers Z$ 2 to 76 million.  How to cope with exploding </p><p>costs and frequent outages?  Mutare Board and Paper\'s </p><p>operations manager has successfully lobbied ZESA for a </p><p>reduction from the proposed Z$ 450 to 205 million, </p><p>convincing the GOZ that it would not have paper to print </p><p>the state-run Herald and other press.  Several firms have </p><p>begun graveyard shifts to make up for scheduled morning </p><p>or afternoon shut-offs. Others are overproducing when </p><p>power is available, building a reserve stock of products </p><p>for low-energy periods. </p><p> </p><p>Other Obstacles </p><p>--------------- </p><p>5. (SBU) However, the industrialists\' headaches do not </p><p>end there.  The 20-year old tea-bagging machine at </p><p>Tanganda, Zimbabwe\'s large tea producer, functions so </p><p>shabbily that it wastes 40 percent of packing material. </p><p>At the same time, the GOZ slashed Tanganda\'s controlled </p><p>prices in half after it announced higher-than-expected </p><p>profits in January (required for listed companies).  The </p><p>Financial Manager decried the GOZ\'s ingrained ideological </p><p>hostility to honest profit-making. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) From the political spectrum\'s other end, </p><p>opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC)\'s recent </p><p>two-day stayaway caught firms in a tough bind.  Border </p><p>Timbers, which makes wooden doors for Home Depot, </p><p>successfully implored employees to ignore the stayaway. </p><p>Border\'s management argued the mammoth U.S. home- </p><p>improvement chain would be unsympathetic to late </p><p>shipments caused by political protest.  Consequently, </p><p>local MDC officials blast the company\'s "pro-government" </p><p>stance. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) Unstable politics clearly hurts.  Border Timbers </p><p>said its U.S. agent has begun diverting business to South </p><p>African competitors.  Although he considers Border </p><p>Timber\'s product better and cheaper, the agent seeks a </p><p>hedge against political or economic collapse in Zimbabwe. </p><p>As a result, Border Timber has had to reduce weekly U.S.- </p><p>bound container shipments from 8 to 5. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>8. (SBU) The approximate 30-fold disparity in energy </p><p>prices for exporting and non-exporting firms will divert </p><p>resources from productive uses.  A non-exporting firm has </p><p>already offered to act as "front-man," buying energy from </p><p>ZESA at subsidized rates and covertly selling to </p><p>exporters at a lower rate.  As with firms that now buy </p><p>maize-meal or fuel at controlled prices, then resell at </p><p>market rates, Zimbabwe\'s distortion-laden economy fosters </p><p>such rent-seeking opportunism. </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) That Mutare\'s exporters are enduring, even </p><p>profiting, is a measure of remarkable entrepreneurship. </p><p>When Border Timbers first approached the U.S. market 5 </p><p>years ago, Home Depot\'s obsession with quality was "far </p><p>beyond anything we could imagine."  Yet after 2 years of </p><p>losses, the company became Home Depot\'s most dependable </p><p>door producer - a success story with parallels throughout </p><p>Zimbabwe\'s economy.  But even Mutare\'s adroit managers </p><p>will not be able to overcome a permanently shattered </p><p>economic infrastructure. </p><p> </p><p>Sullivan </p><p></p></div>
