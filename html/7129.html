<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 LAGOS 000731 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR OECD/IEA </p><p>TASHKENT FOR BURKHALTER </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EPET, ENRG, EFIN, ECON, EINV, PINS, NI </p><p>SUBJECT:  TFIZ01:  BACK IN BUSINESS -  CHEVRON  NIGERIA </p><p>RESUMES LIMITED OPERATIONS IN THE DELTA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REFS:     A: Lagos 677 </p><p>          B: Lagos 707 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CONTAINS SENSITIVE PROPRIETARY INFORMATION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary: Contrary to recent news reports and </p><p>statements by oil executives that companies are not </p><p>ready to resume operations in the delta region anytime </p><p>soon, Chevron confirmed today that it had been </p><p>returning workers to its transfer station and tank farm </p><p>at Escravos this week.  As of April 4, the company </p><p>resumed crude oil production, albeit on a limited </p><p>scale.  Full operations are not expected before the end </p><p>of April, perhaps longer.  There is no indication yet </p><p>of when Shell will resume operations in the Nigerian </p><p>swamp.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Chevron-Texaco spokesperson Andrew Norman told </p><p>Econoff that the company has returned workers to its </p><p>transfer station and tank farm at Escravos (reftel </p><p>677), and as of April 4, has resumed crude oil </p><p>production from that facility.  Norman said that the </p><p>workers are gradually bringing production online, and </p><p>the company expects to reach 310,000 barrels per day </p><p>(bpd) of crude oil production by the end of April. </p><p>During this time, it will assess when it may be able to </p><p>return its output from the Niger River delta region to </p><p>the 440,000 bpd level maintained before the outbreak of </p><p>violence in the area. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) When pressed, Norman confirmed that the </p><p>130,000 bpd difference is accounted for by the fact </p><p>that, for the time being, Chevron will not re-staff the </p><p>wells and small production facilities the company </p><p>maintains in the swamps.  The Escravos terminal, </p><p>located near the mouth of the Escravos River at the </p><p>Gulf of Guinea, is larger, extensively developed and </p><p>easier to defend.  The company is comfortable that its </p><p>employees will be safe there now.  A statement released </p><p>by the company quotes Jay Pryor, Chevron Nigeria </p><p>Limited\'s managing director, as saying, "We have been </p><p>encouraged by the recent calm in the Western Niger </p><p>Delta and, after receiving a number of government </p><p>assurances on security in the area, we now believe that </p><p>current circumstances allow for the safe return of our </p><p>workers to Escravos and for us to restart production." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Norman also told Econoff that of the </p><p>production from Escravos coming back online </p><p>immediately, priority of output will go to the oil </p><p>refineries in Warri and Kaduna.  These refineries have </p><p>essentially been closed and left without crude oil </p><p>supply after Chevron stopped pumping from Escravos (ref </p><p>A and B).  He admits the company has been under </p><p>pressure from the government to resume supply to the </p><p>refineries, but insists that worker safety remains the </p><p>company\'s chief concern.  Nigeria has been suffering </p><p>from a serious fuel shortage for several weeks, and </p><p>closures of the refineries have exacerbated the problem </p><p>(ref A and B). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Norman would not speculate when crude exports </p><p>will resume.  He noted that the company was revising </p><p>its March and April loading schedules when the violence </p><p>broke out, and he is uncertain exactly when and what </p><p>volume of lifting will recommence.  He also would not </p><p>comment on when Shell can be expected to restart </p><p>operations, but he agreed that its situation is more </p><p>difficult, having more operations scattered throughout </p><p>the swamps. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) Comment. This development is a welcome sign for </p><p>world oil production, and it also brings needed relief </p><p>to President Obasanjo\'s reelection bid and the national </p><p>elections themselves.  The volatile delta situation has </p><p>loomed large as the country gears up for national, </p><p>state and local elections beginning April 12, and the </p><p>protracted fuel crisis has begun to affect all aspects </p><p>of Nigerian life and economy. The visuals of mile long </p><p>gas lines and the resulting inconvenience around the </p><p>country ensured that the problem was never far from </p><p>everyone\'s mind.  If peace in the Delta ensues, and if </p><p>Nigeria\'s refineries can alleviate some of the gasoline </p><p>and diesel shortage, the chances will be better for the </p><p>elections to be conducted peacefully, and Obasanjo may </p><p>be able to claim some credit.  Nonetheless, even when </p><p>Chevron reaches its new target production goal of </p><p>310,000 bpd from Escravos, Nigeria will still be losing </p><p>almost a half-million bpd from the region.  That </p><p>translates into a significant loss of national revenue, </p><p>and continued world market interest in what\'s happening </p><p>in Nigeria. End Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HINSON-JONES </p><p></p></div>
