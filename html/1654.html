DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF & LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR FOR </p><p>CONGRESSMAN CLAY SHAW (R-FLORIDA) CASTRO ASKED THANG WHETHER </p><p>THE THEN UPCOMING PARTY CONGRESS (APRIL 19-22) WOULD </p><p>CONSIDER SUCH ECONOMIC LIBERALIZATION MEASURES AS PRIVATE </p><p>OWNERSHIP OF PROPERTY AND RELINQUISHING GOVERNMENT CONTROL </p><p>OF THE ECONOMY.  THANG REPLIED THAT THE PARTY CONGRESS WOULD </p><p>ACCELERATE VIETNAM\'S "DOI MOI" ("RENOVATION") PROCESS.  HE </p><p>SPELLED OUT THE HISTORY OF DOI MOI AND ITS ACHIEVEMENTS TO </p><p>DATE.

AUDREY LESESNE DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF FOR CONGRESSMAN </p><p>MIKE MCINTRYRE ASKED THANG ABOUT VIETNAM\'S ABILITY TO </p><p>IMPLEMENT INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNIZED LABOR STANDARDS.  THANG </p><p>EXPLAINED THAT THE MINISTRY OF LABOR, WAR INVALIDS AND </p><p>SOCIAL WELFARE (MOLISA), WITH WHOM THE STAFFDEL WAS MEETING </p><p>SEPARATELY, COULD ANSWER THE QUESTION IN MORE DETAIL. </p><p>NEVERTHELESS, HE POINTED OUT THAT VIETNAM IS A COUNTRY OF </p><p>WORKERS, EIGHTY PERCENT OF THEM IN THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR. </p><p>THEY WORK UNDER EXTREMELY DIFFICULT CONDITIONS, HE SAID, </p><p>CAUSED BY THE LINGERING AFTERMATH OF THE WAR AND DIFFICULT </p><p>PHYSICAL CONDITIONS.  HE ALSO CITED NATURAL DISASTERS, SUCH </p><p>AS FLOODS.  HE SAID THAT THE PEOPLE OF VIETNAM "GREATLY </p><p>VALUE THE VALUE OF WORK."   VIETNAM DESIRES THAT VIETNAMESE </p><p>WORKERS LIVE UNDER THE SAME CONDITIONS AS OTHER WORKERS IN </p><p>THE REGION.  THE RIGHT CONDITIONS MUST BE CREATED SO THAT </p><p>VIETNAM CAN TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE OF ITS LABOR FORCE, HE SAID. </p><p>HE ADDED THAT VIETNAM ALSO HAS IMPLEMENTED A LABOR CODE, AND </p><p>HAS JOINED THE INTERNATIONAL LABOR ORGANIZATION (ILO).

MAN SAID THAT VIETNAM </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  00989  02 OF 05  260920Z </p><p>BEGAN NEGOTIATIONS TO ENTER THE WTO IN 1995.  THE FIRST </p><p>STEP, CLARIFYING THE TRADE REGIME, IS NOW COMPLETE.  THE </p><p>SECOND STEP IS PREPARING APPROPRIATE TARIFF REDUCTIONS AND </p><p>REMOVAL OF NON-TARIFF MEASURES.  ALL RELEVANT VIETNAMESE </p><p>MINISTRIES ARE NOW PREPARING FOR THE INITIAL OFFER, HE SAID. </p><p>THE COMPARATIVE STRENGTHS OF THE VIETNAMESE ECONOMY MUST BE </p><p>IDENTIFIED IN ORDER TO BRING VIETNAM INTO THE STRONGEST </p><p>POSITION POSSIBLE IN THE INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORDER. </p><p>VIETNAM HAS BEEN EXCHANGING VIEWS WITH COUNTRIES WHICH HAVE </p><p>RECENTLY ACCEDED TO THE WTO, SUCH AS UKRAINE.  VIETNAM IS </p><p>NOW ATTEMPTING TO IDENTIFY WHO WILL BE THE FIRST PARTNER TO </p><p>NEGOTIATE WITH, FOR EXAMPLE, THE EU OR THE U.S. </p><p>DOMESTICALLY, HE SAID, VIETNAM NEEDS TO CONTINUE DOI MOI, </p><p>ADJUST THE LEGAL SYSTEM, AND CARRY OUT THE ECONOMIC </p><p>RECONSTRUCTION OF THE COUNTRY.  THE DECISIVE FACTORS FOR </p><p>INTEGRATION WILL BE THE EFFICIENCY AND COMPETITIVENESS OF </p><p>THE VIETNAMESE ECONOMY, HE SAID. </p><p> </p><p>11. IN THEIR MEETING WITH VICE MINISTER TU OF THE TRADE </p><p>MINISTRY, THE QUESTIONS MORE SPECIFICALLY FOCUSED ON TRADE- </p><p>RELATED MATTERS.  CHUCK ATKINS, THE STAFFDEL LEADER, ASKED </p><p>ABOUT THE NATURE OF VIETNAM\'S TRADE AND WHICH SECTORS WERE </p><p>GROWING.  TU RESPONDED THAT DESPITE GAINS IN </p><p>INDUSTRIALIZATION, VIETNAM REMAINS VERY MUCH AN AGRICULTURAL </p><p>COUNTRY AND AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS ACCOUNT FOR SOME THIRTY </p><p>PERCENT OF TOTAL EXPORTS.  SEAFOOD PRODUCTS AND FISHERIES </p><p>EXPORTS WERE DOING ESPECIALLY WELL.  HANDICRAFT ITEMS WERE </p><p>IMPORTANT AND HELPED ABSORB EXCESS LABOR.  ELECTRONICS </p><p>EXPORTS HAVE GROWN FROM ALMOST NOTHING TO A SIGNIFICANT </p><p>SHARE OF TOTAL EXPORTS IN ONLY A FEW YEARS.  FINALLY, TU </p><p>COMMENTED ON THE GOVERNMENT\'S DESIRE TO PROMOTE SOFTWARE </p><p>EXPORTS IN THE FUTURE, IN PART TO PUT TO WORK MANY CURRENTLY </p><p>UNDEREMPLOYED, BUT TALENTED, VIETNAMESE. </p><p> </p><p>12.  TIM REIF ASKED ABOUT VIETNAMESE EFFORTS UNDERWAY TO </p><p>IMPLEMENT TRANSPARENCY AND SERVICES COMMITMENTS, AS WELL AS </p><p>OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE GOODS CHAPTER OF THE BTA RELATING TO </p><p>DISTRIBUTION OF GOODS, IN LIGHT OF THE MONOPOLIES OR NEAR </p><p>MONOPOLIES OF SOES WHICH WILL RESIST SUCH LIBERALIZATION. </p><p>REIF ALSO ASKED REGARDING INTERNATIONAL LABOR STANDARDS AND </p><p>WHERE THE TRADE MINISTRY STOOD ON THAT ISSUE.  TU REPLIED </p><p>THAT HIS GOVERNMENT DEEPLY APPRECIATED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE </p><p>FROM THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AND THE USVTC (THROUGH A USAID </p><p>GRANT) WHICH HAS PROVEN HIGHLY USEFUL.  HE MENTIONED THE BTA </p><p>WAS NEGOTIATED WITH THE WTO IN MIND AND THE GOVERNMENT WAS </p><p>ALREADY TAKING STEPS TO IMPLEMENT THE AGREEMENT.  A NUMBER </p><p>OF VIETNAMESE GOVERNMENT MINISTRIES ARE ALREADY ENGAGED IN </p><p>EXAMINING THE COMMITMENTS AND ANALYZING WHAT WILL NEED TO BE </p><p>DONE TO ADDRESS THE COMMITMENTS.  REGARDING TRANSPARENCY, IN </p><p>PARTICULAR, HE NOTED THIS SAME ISSUE ARISES NOT ONLY IN THE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00989  03 OF 05  260920Z </p><p>BTA, BUT ALSO IN CONNECTION WITH DISCUSSIONS WHICH TAKE </p><p>PLACE IN THE AFTA AND WTO CONTEXTS.  TU MENTIONED RECENT </p><p>LAWS ALREADY PASSED (E.G., LAST YEAR\'S INVESTMENT LAW </p><p>AMENDMENTS), THE CUSTOMS LAW DRAFT WHICH WILL SOON BE </p><p>SUBMITTED TO THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY, AND OTHERS AS EXAMPLES </p><p>OF WORK UNDERWAY.  HE POINTED OUT THAT VIETNAM HAS LICENSED </p><p>A NUMBER OF FOREIGN INSURERS, INCLUDING AIA OF THE U.S., </p><p>THUS INDICATING THAT VIETNAM IS INDEED PURSUING SERVICE </p><p>SECTOR LIBERALIZATION. </p><p> </p><p>13.  WITH REGARD TO GOODS DISTRIBUTION, TU MENTIONED THAT </p><p>COMPANIES LIKE COCA COLA ALREADY HAVE THEIR OWN DISTRIBUTION </p><p>NETWORKS.  "WE\'RE ALREADY BEYOND WHAT THE COMMITMENTS </p><p>REQUIRE," HE CLAIMED AT ONE POINT.  FURTHERMORE, HE </p><p>INDICATED THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS EQUITIZING AN EVER-LARGER </p><p>NUMBER OF SOES, AND THE IMF AND WORLD BANK ARE HELPING THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT IN THAT PROCESS.  ON LABOR STANDARDS, TU DEFERRED </p><p>TO MOLISA TO ADDRESS THE ANSWER, BUT POINTED OUT THAT THE </p><p>U.S. AND VIETNAM WERE ALREADY COOPERATING VIA THE MOU ON </p><p>LABOR COOPERATION AND DIALOGUE SIGNED WHEN FORMER PRESIDENT </p><p>CLINTON VISITED IN NOVEMBER 2000. </p><p> </p><p>14.  SENATOR MCCAIN\'S COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR NANCY IVES </p><p>MENTIONED THAT THE SENATOR WAS KEEN TO HAVE THE BTA TAKEN UP </p><p>IN THE CONGRESS BECAUSE IT PROVIDED A `ROADMAP\' FOR REFORM </p><p>OF THE TRADE AND INVESTMENT SECTORS OF THE VIETNAMESE </p><p>ECONOMY.  FINALLY, CONGRESSMAN DUNN\'S LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR </p><p>VERGIL CABASCO ASKED REGARDING VIETNAM\'S APPROACH TO ILLICIT </p><p>TRANSSHIPMENT OF GOODS THROUGH THE COUNTRY.  VICE MINISTER </p><p>TU ADMITTED THAT ILLEGAL TRANSSHIPMENT WAS NOT AN EASY </p><p>PROBLEM TO DEAL WITH IN LIGHT OF THE COUNTRY\'S 3000 </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  00989  03 OF 05  260920Z </p><p>KILOMETERS OF COASTLINE AND 70 SEAPORTS, BUT THE GVN WAS </p><p>AWARE OF ITS IMPORTANCE AND HAS BEGUN ADDRESSING IT VIA A </p><p>NEWLY ISSUED DECREE SUBJECTING WOULD BE TRANSSHIPPERS TO </p><p>LICENSING REQUIREMENTS.  (NB. IN MID-MAY, THE U.S. CUSTOMS </p><p>SERVICE WILL PRESENT SEMINARS IN HANOI AND HCMC TO </p><p>VIETNAMESE CUSTOMS AND TEXTILE INDUSTRY REPRESENTATIVES ON </p><p>TRANSSHIPMENT ISSUES AND WAYS TO COMBAT THE PROBLEM. </p><p>EMBASSY AND CONSULATE GENERAL HCMC ARE WORKING CLOSELY WITH </p><p>MINISTRY OF TRADE AND OTHER VIETNAMESE OFFICIALS IN MAKING </p><p>ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE SEMINARS.) </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>15.  THIS BACK-AND-FORTH PROVIDES ONLY A REPRESENTATIVE </p><p>SAMPLE OF THE CONSIDERABLE INFORMATION ABOUT VIETNAM </p><p>EXCHANGED DURING THE STAFFDEL VISIT.  WHILE THE BTA WAS </p><p>CLEARLY FOREMOST ON THE STAFFERS\' MINDS, THEY ALSO ASKED </p><p>QUESTIONS THE ANSWERS TO WHICH WILL BE CONSIDERED IN THE </p><p>UPCOMING ANNUAL DISAPPROVAL VOTE FOR THE JACKSON-VANIK </p><p>WAIVER EXTENSION.  IN ADDITION TO ECONOMIC MATTERS, THEY </p><p>ALSO EXPRESSED KEEN INTEREST IN VIETNAM\'S POLITICAL </p><p>DEVELOPMENT.  REGARDING THE LATTER INTEREST, THE STAFFDEL </p><p>ARRIVED IN HANOI AT ONE OF THE MOST FASCINATING MOMENTS IN </p><p>VIETNAM\'S MODERN HISTORY, AS THE LEADERSHIP OF THE COUNTRY </p><p>WAS BEING DECIDED IN PREPARATION FOR THE NINTH PARTY </p><p>CONGRESS. </p><p> </p><p>16.
