<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 000324 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EUR/RPM AND EUR/SE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/13/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, TU, NATO </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY AGREES ON U.S. APPROACH TO EU BALKAN OPS </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 9301 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by DCM Robert Deutsch, reasons 1.5, b/d. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DCM delivered reftel points on EU operations in the Balkans </p><p>to MFA DG for International Security Affairs Morali January </p><p>13.  Morali said the GOT agreed with the US approach and </p><p>would support the US on this issue in Brussels.  He noted </p><p>that turning over peacekeeping in Macedonia to the EU likely </p><p>would not present a problem, but SFOR would be more </p><p>difficult, would take more time, and should be considered </p><p>carefully.  Withdrawing prematurely could jeopardize the </p><p>fragile stability there.  Morali noted the NAC discussion </p><p>would be a good opportunity to examine the issue.  When asked </p><p>if the US efforts to turn over Balkans operations to the EU </p><p>were part of a strategy to shift those forces to an Iraqi </p><p>operation, the DCM reminded Morali that US policy has long </p><p>been "in together, out together, but hasten the day." </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
