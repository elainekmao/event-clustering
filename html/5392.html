The centers, which will be </p><p>run by the Turkish Red Crescent, will distribute aid </p><p>material to refugees.  The paper says reports Turkey is </p><p>planning to set up 18 camps for refugees - 12 in northern </p><p>Iraq, and 6 in Turkey.  U.S. Assistant Secretary for </p><p>Population, Refugees and Migration, Richard Greene, </p><p>discussed these issues in Ankara with MFA and Red Crescent </p><p>officials on Tuesday.  Some members of  Greene\'s delegation </p><p>will hold inspections along the Iraqi border. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Cyprus: UN Cyprus envoy De Soto met in Ankara with MFA U/S </p><p>Ziyal and Foreign Minister Yakis on Tuesday, and will hold </p><p>talks with AKP leader Erdogan and Prime Minister Gul today. </p><p>"Cumhuriyet" claims that De Soto presented Ankara with </p><p>alternative maps for the division of land.  De Soto stressed </p><p>that revision to the UN Cyprus plan could be possible if </p><p>both sides agree on the changes.  Opposition CHP leader </p><p>Baykal strongly criticized Erdogan, who has slammed Denktas </p><p>for pursuing a policy of `non-solution\' for the last 20 </p><p>years.  The Turkish people did not elect Erdogan to tie the </p><p>hands of Denktas, Baykal said.  Erdogan in turn denounced </p><p>Baykal, and said that the AKP has no intention of giving </p><p>Cyprus away, but wanted a solution to the problem.  Turkish </p><p>Cypriot leader Denktas said on Tuesday that the UN plan </p><p>would be acceptable if the Turks\' sovereignty rights are </p><p>recognized, the maps are changed, and Turkey\'s guarantor </p><p>status is preserved. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Economy: Papers expect the government this week to work on </p><p>reforms necessary for the release of World Bank loans.  The </p><p>cabinet will discuss the privatization of Vakifbank, Turkish </p><p>Telekom, and energy plants.  "Turkiye" reports IMF officials </p><p>as warning Turkey that the war compensation package promised </p><p>by the U.S. would not be sufficient to meet Turkey\'s losses </p><p>in a war.  "Vatan" writes that the IMF is uneasy about the </p><p>government\'s pledge to construct new motorways, and state </p><p>incentives for farmers and entrepreneurs.  The IMF sent a </p><p>sharply-worded letter to the Treasury last Friday, saying </p><p>that ties with the government would be cut unless </p><p>fundamental measures demanded by the IMF are put into </p><p>effect.  The IMF is still awaiting the government to take </p><p>steps to control the inflated employment in the public </p><p>sector, according to Vatan.  "Radikal" says that the U.S. </p><p>Treasury shared the view that Ankara has deviated from the </p><p>economic program.  Meanwhile, Dogan Media Group papers </p><p>"Hurriyet" and "Milliyet" alleged that the government is </p><p>using public resources to rescue the Cukurova Group, which </p><p>is owned by Mehmet Emin Karamehmet.  Cukurova is the former </p><p>owner of the troubled Pamukbank.   The papers claim that a </p><p>secret $6 billion protocol was signed by the government and </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Karamehmet as a way to save Cukurova.  Reports also carry a </p><p>Financial Times story saying that the IMF wants an </p><p>investigation to see whether the Banking Supervisory Board </p><p>(BDDK) has provided special privileges for Karamehmet. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION:  State of the Union - Iraq </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Genuine way toward peace: Iraq without Saddam" </p><p>Omer Celik, an MP from AKP wrote in tabloid Star (1/29): </p><p>"The US should seriously think about the world-wide </p><p>reactions about the Iraq issue questioning both the US </p><p>`goals\' and `methods.\'  It is very legitimate and very </p><p>humane to stand against the war.  Yet this is not where the </p><p>issue ends.  Saddam Hussein represents an incompatibility </p><p>with the level of humanitarian progress, which goes from </p><p>testing weapons on his own people to posing threat to the </p><p>region.  His way of leadership, which is fed with weaknesses </p><p>and mistakes of his rivals, is no way acceptable to the </p><p>people of Iraq or to the world. . The fact of the matter is </p><p>that pro-peace methods did not yet produce a mechanism to </p><p>end the political careers of Saddam-alike political figures. </p><p>On the Iraq issue, standing against the war is a right thing </p><p>but it somehow contributes to his political lifespan. . </p><p>Today unfortunately the peace-seekers once again overlooked </p><p>the issue of Iraqi people who suffers under a dictator\'s </p><p>oppression.  There is only way to prevent a war: paving the </p><p>way for Iraq without Saddam.  No peace initiatives will be </p><p>exempt from oversight unless a clear stance against Saddam </p><p>is declared.  Any peace effort with the lack of anti-Saddam </p><p>stance will lead an indirect support for war." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The speech of his life" </p><p>Fikret Ertan gives an early comment on the State of the </p><p>Union address in Islamic-intellectual Zaman (1/29): "The </p><p>rhetoric of President Bush at his State of the Union address </p><p>is critically important to the whole world.  We will all see </p><p>his approach to the Iraq issue.  The speech writers and </p><p>editors include Michael Gerson who is a radical Christian, </p><p>and Karen Hughes who is a former journalist as well as </p><p>Bush\'s confidant.  It seems the speech will predominantly </p><p>work on two issues; American economy and Iraq. . Bush is not </p><p>the best man of speeches and he was criticized for his </p><p>remarks during his other public addresses.  But this time </p><p>the State of the Union is considered as the speech of his </p><p>life." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
