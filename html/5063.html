<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ABU DHABI 000159 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARP, NEA/PPD, INR </p><p>SECDEF FOR OASD/PA </p><p>USCINCCENT FOR POLAD </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH; PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: OIIP, KMDR, TC </p><p>SUBJECT:  MEDIA REACTION:  MEPI, IRAQ, AND NORTH KOREA </p><p> </p><p>1.  SUMMARY:  REGIONAL AND UAE MEDIA FOCUSED LARGELY ON A </p><p>PERCEIVED DOUBLE STANDARD IN U.S. POLICIES TOWARDS NORTH KOREA </p><p>AND IRAQ AS WELL AS THE MIDDLE EAST PARTNERSHIP INITIATIVE </p><p>(MEPI).  AN "AKHBAR AL ARAB" EDITORIAL QUESTIONED WHY WASHINGTON </p><p>DOES NOT APPLY A STRONG STANCE TO NORTH KOREA SIMILAR TO WHAT IT </p><p>DOES ON IRAQ. CONVERSELY, AN "AL KHALEEJ" EDITORIAL ARGUED THAT </p><p>THE U.S. IS NOT REQUIRED TO START A WAR WITH NORTH KOREA, BUT IT </p><p>SHOULD HALT ITS MOVEMENT TO WAR WITH IRAQ.  IN ANOTHER EDITORIAL, </p><p>"AL KHALEEJ" URGED IRAQ TO PRACTICE SELF-RESTRAINT.  "AL BAYAN" </p><p>COMMENTED THAT THE U.S. DOES NOT REALIZE ITS POLICIES GENERATE </p><p>HOSTILITY WITH MOST PEOPLE AROUND THE GLOBE.  COMMENTING ON U.S. </p><p>EFFORTS TO PROMOTE MEPI, QATARI WRITER DR. AHMED ABDUL MALAK </p><p>CONCLUDES THAT THE RELIGIOUS MAINSTREAM IN THE GULF WILL NOT </p><p>ALLOW THE SPREAD OF THESE VALUES.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  COMMENTING ON A PERCEIVED DOUBLE STANDARD IN U.S. POLICIES </p><p>TOWARDS NORTH KOREA AND IRAQ, ABU DHABI-BASED PAN-ARAB "AKHBAR AL </p><p>ARAB" EDITORIALIZED ON 1/9: </p><p> </p><p>"THE SUPPORTERS FOR WAR STILL PREFER A BUSH-SHARON BRINKMANSHIP </p><p>TYPE POLICY WITH IRAQ ... THE QUESTION IS WHY DOESN\'T THE BUSH- </p><p>SHARON ADMINISTRATION APPLY THE SAME SORT OF HOSTILE METHODS TO </p><p>NORTH KOREA, ESPECIALLY AFTER IT EXPELLED THE NUCLEAR INSPECTORS? </p><p>THE REASON IS CLEAR; NORTH KOREA IS STRONG AND UNITED, WHERE AS </p><p>IRAQ IS MILITARILY WEAK AND DESTROYED SOCIALLY DUE TO THE </p><p>SANCTIONS.  IRAQ ALSO SUFFERS FROM THE GROWING MISTAKES OF THE </p><p>IRAQI LEADERSHIP.  THE MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION IS WHAT WILL </p><p>HAPPEN IF THE RESULTS OF THE AMERICAN WAR ON IRAQ ARE NOT WHAT </p><p>BUSH-SHARON DESIRE?" </p><p> </p><p>3.  COMMENTING ON THE SAME SUBJECT, "AKHBAR AL ARAB" </p><p>EDITORIALIZED ON 1/11: </p><p> </p><p>"... THE WAR ON IRAQ IS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME FOR WASHINGTON.  IT </p><p>IS WAITING TO COMPLETE ITS MILITARY BUILD-UP AND END NEGOTIATIONS </p><p>WITH THE BIG POWERS ON EACH SHARE OF THE IRAQI PIE OR, SAY, THE </p><p>MORE DELICIOUS ARAB PIE.  THE REAL INTENTIONS BEHIND THE WAR ARE </p><p>CLEAR NOW." </p><p> </p><p>4.  DISCUSSING AN AMERICAN-LED WAR ON IRAQ AND THE NEGOTIATIONS </p><p>WITH NORTH KOREA, SHARJAH-BASED PAN-ARAB "AL KHALEEJ" </p><p>EDITORIALIZED ON 1/11: </p><p> </p><p>"... WHAT IS REQUIRED NOW IS NOT TO DECLARE WAR AGAINST THE U.S. </p><p>AS PYONG YANG HAS DONE.  WHAT IS REQUIRED NOW IS TO STAND UP </p><p>HONESTLY AND SINCERELY TO STOP THE AMERICAN WAR ON ARABS WHICH IS </p><p>SEEN THROUGH ITS AGGRESSION AGAINST IRAQ AND THE INCREASING </p><p>ZIONIST AGGRESSION IN PALESTINE." </p><p> </p><p>5.  COMMENTING ON WHAT IT CALLED THE \'TRICKY\' STATEMENT OF HANS </p><p>BLIX ON THE RESULTS OF WMD INSPECTIONS, "AL KHALEEJ" </p><p>EDITORIALIZED ON 1/10: </p><p> </p><p>"... IT (IRAQ) MUST ADOPT A POLICY OF SELF-RESTRAINT IN ORDER TO </p><p>PREVENT ANY RESPONCE TO THE PROVOCATIONS OF BUSH, BLAIR, BLIX, OR </p><p>THE WMD INSPECTORS.  THE INCREASING MILITARY BUILD-UP (IN THE </p><p>GULF) BY WASHINGTON AND LONDON IS NOT TOURISM.  IT IS FOR A VERY </p><p>CLEAR MISSION." </p><p> </p><p>6.  ARGUING THAT THE CONFLICT WITH IRAQ CLEARLY PROVIDES THE U.S. </p><p>IS AN INSANE, IMPERIAL POWER ABIDING ONLY BY THE LAW OF THE </p><p>JUNGLE, DUBAI-BASED BUSINESS-ORIENTED "AL BAYAN" EDITORIALIZED ON </p><p>1/11: </p><p> </p><p>"... THROUGH THIS WAR, THE U.S. CONVEYS A MESSAGE TO THOSE WHO </p><p>DARE TO THINK OF COMPETING AGAINST IT.   THE U.S. IS SAYING THAT </p><p>IT IS THE ONLY EMPIRE IN THE WORLD.  ITS PLAN OF WORLD DOMINATION </p><p>HAS NO ROOM FOR PARTNERS.  MOREOVER, EVERYBODY MUST CARRY OUT ITS </p><p>ORDERS OR BE PUNISHED THE SAME WAY AS IRAQ ... THE U.S. DOES NOT </p><p>REALIZE THAT THIS SITUATION WILL GENERATE MORE HOSTILITY WITH </p><p>PEOPLE AROUND THE GLOBE AND ONLY RESULT IN FURTHER ISOLATION." </p><p> </p><p>7.  NOTING THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE PROTESTING A WAR ON IRAQ IS </p><p>INCREASING, "AL BAYAN" EDITORIALIZED ON 1/10: </p><p> </p><p>"... THE CIRCLE OF PEOPLE REFUSING A WAR IN IRAQ IS WIDENING IN </p><p>THE WEST.  WILL WASHINGTON LISTEN AND RESPOND?" </p><p> </p><p>8.  COMMENTING ON MEPI, EGYPTIAN INTELLECTUAL SYED YASSIN ABU </p><p>EDITORIALIZED IN DHABI-BASED SEMI-OFFICIAL "AL ITTIHAD" ON 1/9: </p><p> </p><p>"... IF THE U.S. TRIES TO PRACTICE SELF-CRITICISM - AS PER </p><p>RICHARD HASS\' CONFESSION OF THE U.S. BEING POLITICALLY </p><p>OPPORTUNIST - WILL IT BE ABLE TO WIDEN THE CIRCLE OF CRITICISM </p><p>AND CONFESS ITS TERRIBLE MISTAKE OF LIMITLESSLY SUPPORTING THE </p><p>RACIST ISRAEL.  ENJOYING THE U.S. SUPPORT, ISRAEL ADOPTS A CLEAR </p><p>POLICY TO TERMINATE THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE.  IS THE U.S. READY TO </p><p>CONFESS ITS MISTAKE WHEN IT SAYS THAT ISRAEL IS THE OASIS OF </p><p>DEMOCRACY IN THE MIDDLE EAST." </p><p> </p><p>9.  COMMENTING ON THE AMERICAN PRESENCE IN THE GULF SINCE THE </p><p>PREVIOUS WAR WITH IRAQ, QATARI WRITER DR. AHMED ABDUL MALAK WROTE </p><p>IN "AL ITTIHAD" ON 1/9: </p><p> </p><p>"... IF THIS PRESENCE IS JUSTIFIED WITH THE SUPPORT OF MANY </p><p>(ARAB) GOVERNMENTS, THERE WILL BE A CONFLICT WHEN THE AMERICAN </p><p>ADMINISTRATION STARTS FULFILLING ITS PROMISES IN THE REGION, </p><p>I.E., THE LIBERAL VALUES ANNOUNCED BY CONDOLEEZA RICE, AND THE </p><p>MIDDLE EAST PARTNERSHIP INITIATIVE ANNOUNCED BY COLIN POWELL. </p><p>THE RELIGIOUS STREAM IN THE REGION WILL NOT ALLOW THE ACCEPTANCE </p><p>OF THESE VALUES.  IT WILL CONFRONT ANY GOVERNMENT IF IT DECLARES </p><p>ITS CLEAR ACCEPTANCE OF THOSE VALUES ... EVEN THE LIBERAL STREAM </p><p>WILL NOT AGREE WITH APPLYING THOSE VALUES - THOUGH IT BELIEVES IN </p><p>THEM - SIMPLY BECAUSE IT FEELS THAT THEY ARE AN AMERICAN GIFT </p><p>APPLIED THROUGH AMERICAN GUNS AND TANKS.  THIS STREAM REJECTS THE </p><p>AMERICAN PRESENCE IN THE REGION AND MAY SACRIFICE ITS LIBERAL </p><p>VALUES IN RETURN FOR THE DEPARTURE OF AMERICAN FORCES ... IF THE </p><p>U.S. BETS ON A SUCCESSFUL DEAL BETWEEN ARABS AND ISRAEL VIA MEPI </p><p>AND THE VALUES OF DEMOCRACY, WE BELIEVE THAT IT WILL LOSE ITS BET </p><p>... THE U.S. WILL BE A VICTIM OF LOCAL CONTRADICTIONS IN THE </p><p>REGION, ESPECIALLY AFTER DEMOCRATIC CHANGES CAUSE PRO-U.S. </p><p>GOVERNMENTS TO CHANGE THEIR POLICIES AND STRIVE TO GUARANTEE </p><p>THEIR INDEPENDENCE FROM INTERFERENCE IN THEIR INTERNAL AFFAIRS. </p><p>FINALLY, ARAB COUNTRIES WILL REALIZE THE RESULTS OF A CHANGING </p><p>SYLLABUS, DEMOCRATIC VALUES, HUMAN RIGHTS, AND THE ROLE OF WOMAN </p><p>IN DEVELOPMENT.  THESE ARE ALL BURNING ISSUES WHICH THE U.S. MAY </p><p>MAKE HOTTER." </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
