<p>UNCLAS HO CHI MINH CITY 000551 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EAP/BCLTV, DRL </p><p> </p><p>E. O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PGOV, SOCI, VM, HUMANR, RELFREE </p><p>SUBJECT: POLICE QUESTION BUILDER AS CHURCH CONSTRUCTION CONTINUES </p><p> </p><p>REF:  HCMC 0520 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  Mr. Le Van Dung, unofficial contractor for a Protestant </p><p>house church currently under construction in HCMC\'s District 2 </p><p>(reftel), met with police this morning in response to a third </p><p>invitation to discuss his activities at the site.  The first </p><p>invitation, delivered June 9, summoned him to discuss the "illegal </p><p>construction of a house church."  The other two invitations </p><p>dropped the reference to any particular activities, so Mr. Dung </p><p>decided "to accept". </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  A long-time ConGen Protestant contact, claiming to be </p><p>the legal representative of the new church, accompanied Mr. Dung </p><p>to the nearby offices of the local police investigative unit at </p><p>8:30 a.m. local time on June 17.  While police prevented him from </p><p>sitting with his "client" during the 90-minute interview, the </p><p>contact was able to overhear the questioning from a vantage point </p><p>less than five yards away.  He said the police concentrated almost </p><p>entirely on Mr. Dung\'s background -- family, education, and prior </p><p>work experience -- rather than on current efforts to build the </p><p>house church.  Mr. Dung signed a report of the meeting before </p><p>returning to his home.  As he departed, police said they would </p><p>soon tear down the house church. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  While construction continues unabated, efforts are </p><p>hampered by an inadequate supply of construction materials and a </p><p>lack of experienced workers.  A handful of undercover police </p><p>officers maintain their watch over the project, but have not </p><p>interfered with the workers or the structure.  During a recent </p><p>meeting to be reported septel, HCMC People\'s Committee Vice </p><p>Chairman Nguyen Van Dua told Consul General there is no regulation </p><p>allowing construction to proceed if local authorities fail to </p><p>respond to a building permit application within a specified </p><p>timeframe.  In other words, there is no such thing as "tacit </p><p>approval."  He did, however, acknowledge real problems in </p><p>enforcing regulations to prevent illegal construction in HCMC. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Comment: This pastors vs. the police standoff has been </p><p>going on for over a week now.  If the pastors are hoping to make a </p><p>point about religious freedom by engaging in construction without </p><p>a building permit, their assumption that they have some form of </p><p>"tacit approval" (reftel) may not, in fact, help their case.  Post </p><p>will continue to monitor the situation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>YAMAUCHI </p><p></p></div>
