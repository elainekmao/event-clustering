General Ozkok clarified </p><p>charges that `the Turkish military is not supporting the </p><p>northern front option at this stage\' by saying `the Turkish </p><p>military\'s view is the same as that expressed in the </p><p>authorization decree.\'  The General\'s statement became the </p><p>headline story in every Turkish paper. He approached the </p><p>Iraq issue as follows: "The Turkish military is also against </p><p>the war, but we should act realistically and take the side </p><p>of the US in the name of national interests and to </p><p>compensate Turkey\'s losses."  General Ozkok also emphasized </p><p>that staying out of the inevitable war will only ensure that </p><p>Turkey will not receive any compensation for its losses and </p><p>will prevent Turkey from having a say in the post-war </p><p>period. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>General Ozkok\'s remarks were well-received by the AKP </p><p>government.  AKP party officials commented that the </p><p>clarification of the military\'s position on the issue will </p><p>be very helpful in passing the authorization decree from the </p><p>parliament.  The timing of the second decision from </p><p>parliament receives a lot of speculation in the Turkish </p><p>press.  Papers mostly have reached a consensus that the </p><p>issue will be taken up by the new government right after the </p><p>March 9 special election, under Tayyip Erdogan\'s </p><p>premiership.  There is no set date for this action, however, </p><p>and Erdogan said that the party will wait to see a second </p><p>UNSC resolution as part of the evaluation process. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Stories also highlight that markets are calm now as the </p><p>Turkish parliamentary approval is expected following the </p><p>announcement of support by the military.  "Radikal" features </p><p>the continuing base modernization efforts on Turkish bases </p><p>and ports, and asks the readers: "The US is continuing its </p><p>efforts and military work in spite of the Turkish rejection </p><p>of troop deployments.  Is there something the US knows that </p><p>we don\'t?"   A story in "Radikal" talks about MFA work on </p><p>minor revisions to the current authorization decree, which </p><p>might reduce the duration for U.S. troops from 6 to 3 </p><p>months, and decrease the number of American soldiers in </p><p>Turkey.  In the meantime, "Hurriyet" carries an analysis </p><p>highlighting the dialogue between Turkey and the US.  There </p><p>is even an alternate plan in the absence of Turkish approval </p><p>for US ground troops, "Hurriyet" writes.  The story claims </p><p>that Ambassador Pearson mentioned to Prime Minister Gul the </p><p>possible use of air bases only.  Depending of the outcome of </p><p>the Turkish-American dialogue, Ankara might host a </p><p>delegation from the State Department next week. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yeni Safak" writes that due to the Turkish parliament\'s </p><p>denial of permission for US ground troops, the Bush </p><p>administration is sending a Congressional delegation headed </p><p>by Representative Wexler to Turkey for a series of high- </p><p>level appointments.  The story reminds readers that Wexler </p><p>was among the group of 38 congressmen who wrote a letter to </p><p>PM Gul asking Turkey to approve the deployment of ground </p><p>troops on Turkish soil. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Cyprus: "Milliyet" reports that Denktas arrived in Ankara </p><p>for meetings with Turkish officials prior to his trip to the </p><p>Hague.  Denktas will hold a summit meeting today at the </p><p>Presidential Palace with Turkish officials to discuss the </p><p>revised Annan plan and the `March 30 Referandum offer.\' </p><p>Responding to questions of journalists yesterday, Annan was </p><p>quoted as saying that `The new plan is a fait accompli. </p><p>Annan told us to go to the Hague whether we have a positive </p><p>or negative response.  Therefore, I am going to the Hague to </p><p>say `no\' and to explain the reasons for it.\'  Meanwhile, </p><p>"Milliyet" reports that during his meetings in Ankara, </p><p>Denktas will exert efforts to secure support for the </p><p>economic aid package.  Denktas says that the goal of the </p><p>package is to give support to Turkish Cypriot youth.  It is </p><p>reported that Denktas will meet with parliamentary speaker </p><p>Arinc and with PM Gul.  He will also address the parliament. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION: Iraq </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Washington\'s calendar" </p><p>Cengiz Candar of conservative "Dunden Bugune Tercuman" </p><p>details the timing of the US operation plans (3/6): "The </p><p>latest information coming from General Myers shows that the </p><p>upcoming Iraq operation, from the standpoint of military </p><p>tactics, will be very different from the Gulf war.  . Leaked </p><p>information indicates that 3,000 guided missiles will begin </p><p>the strike, followed in 48 hours by a massive air </p><p>bombardment and an immediate ground operation.  General </p><p>Myers confirmed the use of a northern front, which will </p><p>happen with or without Turkey. . Currently the number of US </p><p>troops stationed in the Gulf is 200,000.  This force will be </p><p>enhanced with an additional 60,000 now on their way to the </p><p>region.  Myers is now ready to take the action, and is </p><p>waiting for the order from President Bush.  The order could </p><p>come at any time. General Tommy Franks has already presented </p><p>the final plan to President Bush.  Washington sources tell </p><p>me that next week the US will declare a 2 or 3-day deadline </p><p>to Saddam Hussein.  During that period, the UN inspectors </p><p>and the press corps will be able to leave the country so </p><p>that the operation can begin sometime between March 12 and </p><p>13.  Based on this calendar, we can conclude that the US </p><p>might not even wait for the second decree to be presented </p><p>for Turkish parliamentary approval." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Clarification of the goals" </p><p>Sami Kohen analyzed in mass appeal Milliyet (3/6): </p><p>"According to recent statements coming from Iraqi opposition </p><p>figures, their main goal is to preserve Iraq\'s territorial </p><p>integrity and form a democratic and federal structure. </p><p>Seeking to address Turkish concerns, they are also denying </p><p>any intention of establishing an independent Kurdish state. </p><p>It is now Ankara\'s turn to clarify what are the acceptable </p><p>and unacceptable limits in Iraq for Turkey during the post- </p><p>Saddam era.  This should be a very clear message.  We all </p><p>know well Turkey\'s objection to an independent state. </p><p>However, the Turkish policy on a federal structure in Iraq </p><p>requires clarification. . Ankara should formulate a policy </p><p>based on realistic assessments.  During this assessment </p><p>procedure, it is absolutely necessary to maintain channels </p><p>of dialogue with Kurdish and other Iraqi groups so that </p><p>there will be no more misunderstandings." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
