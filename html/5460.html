HOLY SEE FOREIGN MINISTER ARCHBISHOP JEAN-LOUIS TAURAN </p><p>CALLED IN AMBASSADOR JANUARY 21 TO SHARE THE RESULTS OF THE </p><p>VATICAN NUNCIO IN ZAMBIA\'S ASSESSMENT OF THE FAMINE AND THE </p><p>DEBATE IN ZAMBIA OVER BIOTECH RELIEF FOOD.  TAURAN HAD </p><p>PREVIOUSLY PROMISED THE AMBASSADOR "GOOD NEWS" ON THE </p><p>SUBJECT.  TO THIS END, HE HIGHLIGHTED THE HOLY SEE\'S EARLY </p><p>CONTRIBUTIONS TO AMELIORATE THE FAMINE THROUGH THE ACTIVITIES </p><p>OF CARITAS AND LOCAL CHURCHES.  TAURAN ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE </p><p>ANTI-BIOTECH VIEWS OF THE JESUIT ACTIVIST FATHER HENRIOT HAD </p><p>BECOME WIDELY REGARDED AS THE VIEW OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IN </p><p>ZAMBIA, AND PROMISED THE AMBASSADOR THAT THE HOLY SEE WOULD </p><p>ENSURE THAT ITS GENERALLY PRO-BIOTECH VIEWS WERE PROVIDED TO </p><p>THE ZAMBIAN CONFERENCE OF BISHOPS.  THE HOLY SEE\'S VIEW, AS </p><p>OUTLINED IN A LETTER TO SECRETARY POWELL LAST YEAR (REF C) IS </p><p>THAT BIOTECH FOODS SHOULD BE AVAILABLE TO POPULATIONS IN </p><p>DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATE CAUTION </p><p>COMPARABLE TO THOSE FOR PHARMACEUTICAL GOODS.  THE HOLY SEE </p><p>WILL ALSO ENCOURAGE THE BISHOPS AND, IF THEY ARE RELUCTANT, </p><p>THE NUNCIO, TO SPEAK OUT MORE DIRECTLY ON THE SUBJECT.  A </p><p>RECENT EMBASSY-ORGANIZED CONFERENCE WITH A GROUP OF AFRICAN </p><p>FARMERS AND BIOTECH EXPERTS -- INCLUDING ZAMBIA -- (SEPTEL) </p><p>HELPED MAKE THE CASE TO KEY HOLY SEE OFFICES OF THE SAFETY </p><p>AND POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF BIOTECH FOODS FOR AFRICA.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>THE "GOOD NEWS" COULD BE BETTER </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  00402  01 OF 02  030858Z </p><p>2.  ARCHBISHOP TAURAN MET WITH AMBASSADOR AND DCM JANUARY 21 </p><p>TO FOLLOW UP ON HIS PLEDGE TO LOOK INTO THE CATHOLIC CHURCH\'S </p><p>ROLE IN RESPONDING TO THE FAMINE IN ZAMBIA AND OTHER AFFECTED </p><p>AREAS IN SOUTHERN AFRICA.  AT THE OUTSET, TAURAN SOUGHT TO </p><p>MAKE CLEAR THAT THE HOLY SEE AND ITS AFFILIATED AGENCIES HAD </p><p>BEEN ON THE FRONT LINES OF INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS TO RESPOND. </p><p>FROM FEBRUARY 2002, HE NOTED, THE POPE HAD DONATED $30,000 </p><p>FROM HIS (MODEST) PAPAL FUND FOR GLOBAL RELIEF EFFORTS, AND, </p><p>MORE SIGNIFICANTLY, CARITAS HAD MOBILIZED ITS RESOURCES EARLY </p><p>AND HAD BEEN PLAYED AN IMPORTANT HUMANITARIAN ROLE THROUGHOUT </p><p>THE FAMINE PERIOD.  HE ALSO NOTED THAT THE LOCAL CHURCHES HAD </p><p>BEEN ACTIVE ON THE GROUND IN PROVIDING ASSISTANCE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  ACCORDING TO THE NUNCIO, THE HOLY SEE WAS INFORMED THAT </p><p>THE ZAMBIAN MAIZE CROP SHORTFALL HAD "NOT YET HAD SERIOUS </p><p>EFFECTS, THANKS TO THE AVAILABILITY OF OTHER FOODS IN THE </p><p>COUNTRY."  THE NUNCIO FURTHER MAINTAINED THAT GM FOODS WERE </p><p>NOT INDISPENSABLE TO MEET THE PROBLEM, AS THERE WERE ONLY </p><p>15,000 TONS OF GM MAIZE IN DEPOSIT AT THE CATHOLIC RELIEF </p><p>SERVICES HEADQUARTERS IN ZAMBIA, WHILE THE GOVERNMENT HAS </p><p>100,000 TONS OF NON-GM MAIZE IN RESERVE AND IS FINDING OTHER </p><p>SOURCES.  THE NUNCIO OPINED THAT THE SITUATION "WILL PROBABLY </p><p>NOT GET WORSE IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS." </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>A PLEDGE TO CLARIFY THE HOLY SEE\'S POSITION </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  TAURAN ACKNOWLEDGED THAT JESUIT ACTIVIST FATHER HENRIOT </p><p>HAD UNFORTUNATELY SHAPED THE PUBLIC PERCEPTION OF THE </p><p>CHURCH\'S VIEW IN ZAMBIA.  THIS RESULTED, HE SAID, FROM A </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  00402  01 OF 02  030858Z </p><p>COMBINATION OF HENRIOT\'S PERSONAL ACTIVISM AND THE SILENCE OF </p><p>THE ZAMBIAN CONFERENCE OF BISHOPS, WHO HAVE MADE NO OFFICIAL </p><p>STATEMENT OF THE ADVISABILITY OF ACCEPTING BIOTECH FOODS. </p><p>CONSEQUENTLY, THE NUNCIO REPORTED THAT "THE POSITION OF THE </p><p>JESUIT CENTER IS CONSIDERED TO BE THE POSITION OF THE </p><p>CHURCH."  THE JESUIT\'S POSITION, WHICH HAS UNFORTUNATELY </p><p>HELPED FRAME THE DEBATE OVER BIOTECH FOODS IN ZAMBIA AND </p><p>WHICH MUST NOW BE OVERCOME WITH NEW INFORMATION, WAS </p><p>SUMMARIZED BY THE NUNCIO IN HIS REPORT AS FOLLOWS: </p><p> </p><p>- THE SAFETY OF THESE FOODS IS STILL UNDER STUDY; </p><p> </p><p>- THE CONSUMPTION OF GM FOODS IN THE U.S. IS INTEGRATED IN </p><p>THE CONSUMPTION OF ALL FOODS, WHEREAS IN ZAMBIA IT WOULD BE </p><p>THE ONLY TYPE OF FOOD CONSUMED, WHICH "WOULD WEIGH UPON THE </p><p>DETERMINATION OF ITS SAFETY); </p><p> </p><p>- ZAMBIA IS RESOLVING THE PROBLEM BY IMPORTING </p><p>NON-GENETICALLY MODIFIED FOODS AND IS EDUCATING ITS PEOPLE TO </p><p>DIVERSIFY ITS EATING HABITS; </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ4513 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        VATICA  00402  02 OF 02  030859Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AF-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   AMAD-00  CIAE-00 </p><p>      USNW-00  DODE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    UTED-00  VC-00 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   LAB-01   VCE-00   NSAE-00  PER-00   TEST-00 </p><p>      DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-01   SAS-00     /002W </p><p>                  ------------------2FD976  030859Z /38 </p><p>P 030822Z FEB 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY VATICAN </p><p>TO AMEMBASSY LUSAKA PRIORITY </p><p>SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>INFO EUROPEAN POLITICAL COLLECTIVE </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 02 VATICAN 000402 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT. FOR EUR/WE-MENNUTI, EB, AND AF/S </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAGR, EAID, PREL, VT, ZA </p><p>SUBJECT: HOLY SEE FOREIGN MINISTER TAURAN PLEDGES TO </p><p>CLARIFY HOLY SEE\'S POSITION ON BIOTECH FOODS IN ZAMBIA AND </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICA </p><p> </p><p>- THE GMO\'S COMING FROM THE U.S. ARE NOT IDENTIFIED AS SUCH, </p><p>SINCE THE POLICY OF THE U.S. DOES NOT REQUIRE IT.  HOWEVER </p><p>THE CONSUMER HAS THE RIGHT TO KNOW; </p><p> </p><p>- THE REASON FOR THE U.S. PRESSURE IN THIS MATTER IS BECAUSE </p><p>THERE IS A SURPLUS OF GMO. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  00402  02 OF 02  030859Z </p><p> </p><p>5.  IN LIGHT OF THESE POSITIONS, TAURAN AGREED WITH THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR ON THE NEED TO ENSURE THAT THE HOLY SEE\'S MORE </p><p>BALANCED POSITION WAS WIDELY DISSEMINATED IN THE COUNTRY AND </p><p>REGIONS.  HE PROMISED TO ENSURE THE RESULTS OF THE PONTIFICAL </p><p>ACADEMY OF SCIENCE\'S POSITION -- WHICH SEES NO REASON FOR </p><p>REJECTION OF BIOTECH FOODS AND THEY SHOULD BE PROVIDED TO </p><p>DEVELOPING COUNTRY POPULATIONS AS LONG AS THE PRECAUTIONARY </p><p>PRINCIPAL IS OBSERVED (AS IT IS WITH PHARMACEUTICALS) -- ARE </p><p>PROVIDED TO ALL THE BISHOPS.  THE HOLY SEE WOULD THEN </p><p>ENCOURAGE THE BISHOPS TO ISSUE A STATEMENT AND DISSEMINATE </p><p>THE WORD IN THEIR CHURCHES.  TAURAN ADDED THAT IF THE BISHOPS </p><p>FAILED TO DO SO -- WHICH IS POSSIBLE GIVEN THAT THE HOLY SEE </p><p>CANNOT ORDER BISHOPS TO TAKE SPECIFIC STANDS ON POLITICAL </p><p>ISSUES -- HE WOULD HAVE THE NUNCIO TAKE STEPS TO GET THE HOLY </p><p>SEE\'S POSITION OUT. </p><p> </p><p>6.  THE AMBASSADOR THANKED TAURAN FOR HIS COMMITMENT TO </p><p>ENSURE THE HOLY SEE\'S POSITION WAS DISSEMINATED MORE WIDELY </p><p>IN ZAMBIA AND THE REST OF SOUTHERN AFRICA, BUT STRESSED THE </p><p>IMPORTANCE OF MOVING QUICKLY GIVEN THE STILL PRESENT THREAT </p><p>OF FAMINE IN THE COUNTRY.  WHILE THE AMBASSADOR RECOGNIZED </p><p>THAT THE WORLD FOOD PROGRAM HAD TAKEN STEPS TO WORK AROUND </p><p>THE ZAMBIAN GOVERNMENT\'S REJECTION OF U.S. AID, THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR STRESSED THE INCREASED COSTS AND TIME THIS HAD </p><p>IMPOSED ON THE RELIEF EFFORT.  HE ALSO NOTED THAT OUR </p><p>INFORMATION WAS NOT AS SANGUINE AS THAT PRESENTED BY THE </p><p>NUNCIO, ALTHOUGH FOOD NOW APPEARED TO BE IN THE PIPELINE. </p><p>BEYOND THE IMMEDIATE SITUATION, HOWEVER, THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>POINTED OUT THAT THE ZAMBIAN DECISION REPRESENTED A NEGATIVE </p><p>PRECEDENT WITH POTENTIALLY SERIOUS IMPLICATIONS FOR BROADER </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  00402  02 OF 02  030859Z </p><p>AFRICAN RELIEF IF MORE COUNTRIES BEGAN FOLLOWING ZAMBIA\'S </p><p>LEAD AND REJECTED U.S. FOOD.  GIVEN THAT THE U.S. PROVIDES </p><p>OVER 60 PERCENT OF ALL RELIEF FOOD TO THE REGION, THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR NOTED, SUCH RESTRICTIONS WOULD MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE </p><p>FOR HE WFP TO MEET ITS DEMANDS).  TAURAN AGREED THAT SUCH A </p><p>PRECEDENT WOULD BE UNFORTUNATE, AND CONTRARY TO EFFORTS TO </p><p>FEED THOSE IN NEED. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  THE HOLY SEE\'S RESPONSE ON THIS ISSUE, ABOUT WHICH THE </p><p>EMBASSY HAS BEEN PRESSING SINCE EARLY FALL, HAS BEEN SLOW IN </p><p>COMING.  NEVERTHELESS, WE HAVE HEARD FROM SOURCES WITHIN THE </p><p>HOLY SEE THAT OUR REPEATED INTERVENTIONS -- RECENTLY </p><p>REINFORCED BY OUR CANADIAN AND ARGENTINEAN DIPLOMATIC </p><p>COLLEAGUES -- HAS GOTTEN THE HOLY SEE\'S ATTENTION AND LED TO </p><p>MOVEMENT ON THE ISSUE.  SIGNIFICANTLY, THE POPE MADE TWO </p><p>REFERENCES TO FAMINE IN AFRICA IN HIS ANNUAL ADDRESS TO THE </p><p>DIPLOMATIC CORPS, REINFORCING THE FOCUS THE ISSUE IS NOW </p><p>RECEDING.  THIS GROWING INTEREST WAS ALSO REFLECTED IN THE </p><p>BROAD VATICAN PARTICIPATION AT AN EMBASSY-SPONSORED </p><p>CONFERENCE JANUARY 27 ON BIOTECH IN AFRICA, WHICH WAS </p><p>ATTENDED BY REPRESENTATIVES OF THE SECRETARIAT OF STATE, THE </p><p>COUNCIL FOR JUSTICE AND PEACE, COR UNUM (RESPONSIBLE FOR </p><p>HUMANITARIAN WORK), THE JESUIT DIRECTORS FOR AFRICA AND THE </p><p>U.S., THE CARITAS CATHOLIC RELIEF AGENCY, THE SANT EGIDIO </p><p>COMMUNITY, AND MEMBERS OF THE HOLY SEE DIPLOMATIC CORPS. </p><p>EMBASSY LUSAKA\'S PRESSURE HAS ALSO BEEN HELPFUL IN RAISING </p><p>THE HOLY SEE\'S APPRECIATION OF THE ISSUE, AND WE WOULD URGE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  00402  02 OF 02  030859Z </p><p>THAT THIS BE CONTINUED IN LIGHT OF THE NUNCIO\'S POSITIVE </p><p>REPORT TO THE VATICAN ABOUT THE EMBASSY\'S EFFORTS TO ELICIT A </p><p>MORE ACTIVE AND BALANCED POSITION.  EMBASSY VATICAN WILL </p><p>CONTINUE TO ENGAGE THE HOLY SEE AND AFFILIATED AGENCIES IN </p><p>ROME TO RESPOND TO THE CHALLENGE OF AFRICAN FAMINE AND TO </p><p>ENSURE BROADER UNDERSTANDING OF THE SAFETY AND POTENTIAL </p><p>BENEFITS OF BIOTECH FOODS. </p><p> </p><p>NICHOLSON </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> </p><p></p><p> 2003VATICA00402 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
