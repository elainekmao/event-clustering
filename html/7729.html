<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 RANGOON 000524 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV AND DRL/PHD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAID, KDEM, PGOV, PHUM, BM </p><p>SUBJECT: BURMA HRDF GRANT PROPOSALS </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 79965 </p><p> </p><p>OVERVIEW </p><p> </p><p>1. (U)  Embassy Rangoon submits the four proposals described </p><p>below in response to reftel request for projects promoting </p><p>democracy and human rights.  The projects were chosen because </p><p>they directly support U.S. goals in Burma in regard to </p><p>strengthening civil society and democratic principles.  They </p><p>are small projects which bolster the efforts of local </p><p>organizations to instill and nurture critical thinking, </p><p>freedom of expression, and, ultimately, self-determination in </p><p>a society where these practices have been almost eliminated </p><p>by 40 years of harsh military rule.  Three projects focus on </p><p>ethnic minority groups while one would work with youth </p><p>located in Rangoon.  All are grassroots projects with </p><p>potential for long-term benefits beyond HRDF resources. </p><p> </p><p>SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES/REQUIREMENTS </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU)  Because the military government attempts to closely </p><p>control the activities of all organizations in the country </p><p>and is suspicious of the motives behind any Western funding, </p><p>these projects will require careful implementation to avoid </p><p>endangering the local organizations.  While Embassy </p><p>representatives will be able to occasionally visit the </p><p>organizations or project sites in conjunction with general </p><p>Embassy business, and the organizations will be able to </p><p>provide full accounting for all funding, any overt </p><p>acknowledgement of the projects as State Department funded </p><p>activities could jeopardize the local organizations.  For </p><p>this same reason, funding would have to be disbursed in cash </p><p>rather than bank transfers (which are monitored). </p><p> </p><p>3. (U)  Please direct any questions on the proposals or </p><p>logistical arrangements to the Embassy point of contact: </p><p>Political Officer John Haynes.  The proposals have been sent </p><p>by e-mail to EAP/BCLTV, Burma Desk. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU)  Begin text of proposals: </p><p> </p><p>PROJECT ONE - ETHNIC MINORITY DIALOGUE INITIATIVES </p><p> </p><p>Background:  The Metta and Shalom Foundations (local NGO\'s) </p><p>recently formed the Ethnic Mediators Fellowship (EMF) ) a </p><p>group of 25 key persons from various ethnic groups who are </p><p>directly involved in political mediation in Burma.  These </p><p>individuals are involved in facilitating dialogue within </p><p>their own ethnic groups in order to develop a greater sense </p><p>of unity and common vision. The EMF is a key group </p><p>strategically placed to support dialogue within ethnic groups </p><p>and collaborative efforts across ethnic lines. Though the </p><p>overall EMF group is currently being provided with training </p><p>and consultations, individual ethnic teams are often </p><p>underfunded and unable to move the dialogue process forward </p><p>within their own ethnic group. </p><p> </p><p>Goal:  Enhance and encourage the dialogue processes within </p><p>three ethnic groups by assisting with the logistical expenses </p><p>of the mediator teams. </p><p> </p><p>Budget:  $15,000 for one year. </p><p> </p><p>Expected Outcome:  Three ethnic groups will have planned and </p><p>conducted dialogue sessions within their ethnic communities. </p><p>The experience gained from these dialogue sessions will </p><p>inform the groups, thinking about future processes and will </p><p>assist in establishing dialogue as a means by which conflict </p><p>can be addressed. </p><p> </p><p>PROJECT TWO: SUMMER SCHOOL YOUTH DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM </p><p> </p><p>Background:  Few opportunities exist in Burma for youth to </p><p>develop the requisite skills to be productive members of a </p><p>functioning democracy. The formal education program uses only </p><p>rote memorization and few models exist which promote critical </p><p>thinking skills.  Though the formal educational system has </p><p>been constrained by the military government policies of the </p><p>past 40 years, informal mechanisms exist to build these </p><p>capabilities. One such possibility is through the summer </p><p>youth camps conducted by private cultural, social, and </p><p>religious groups.  These youth camps already teach ethnic </p><p>minority languages, art, music, and other activities. A group </p><p>of motivated individuals can supplement the existing programs </p><p>with approaches which enhance creativity and critical </p><p>thinking skills. Assistance is needed, however, in developing </p><p>a curricula and training an initial group of teachers to </p><p>pilot such a program. </p><p> </p><p>Goal:  Enhance the creative, critical thinking, and </p><p>communication skills of youth. </p><p> </p><p>Budget:  $10,000 for one year. </p><p> </p><p>Expected Outcome:  Curricula will have been developed, 5 </p><p>teachers will have been trained, and the curricula tested </p><p>during the March - May 2004 school holiday. </p><p> </p><p>PROJECT THREE - NON-FORMAL CIVIC EDUCATION PROGRAM </p><p> </p><p>Background:  There has been growing interest by civic </p><p>organizations in Burma who are looking for ways to implement </p><p>a non-formal civic education curriculum in boarding hostels, </p><p>vocational training programs, summer camp and school </p><p>programs, as well as other venues.  The program desired would </p><p>teach students about self-governance and participation, </p><p>conflict resolution, respect for diversity and social </p><p>responsibility. </p><p>The Myanmar Institute of Theology (MIT) would like to better </p><p>develop a civic education curriculum that was developed in </p><p>the late 1990,s, implemented by the Kachin Baptist </p><p>Convention (KBC).  This curriculum continues to be used in </p><p>the KBC,s boarding hostels around the country.  MIT proposes </p><p>to build upon the KBC,s civic education curriculum, and make </p><p>it more broadly available for use by other groups and in </p><p>other settings.  This will require a review of the curriculum </p><p>and its adaptation to other cultural settings. </p><p> </p><p>MIT has the ability to provide the monitoring, reporting and </p><p>accounting required for this project, as well as to provide </p><p>staff to implement the technical aspects of this project, in </p><p>conjunction with other resources available in the community. </p><p> </p><p>Goal:  Revise and update a civic education curriculum and </p><p>make it available for use in multiple, non-formal education </p><p>settings in Burma. </p><p> </p><p>Budget:  $10,000 for one year. </p><p> </p><p>PROJECT FOUR - KAREN DEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE CIVIL EDUCATION </p><p>AND CAPACITY BUILDING </p><p> </p><p>Background:  The Karen Development Committee (KDC) is an </p><p>unofficially organized, nationwide group of Karen community </p><p>members who are actively supporting and undertaking programs </p><p>for the social and political development of all Karen people </p><p>in Burma.  KDC membership draws from all the major regions </p><p>where Karen people live, as well as all the ethnic subgroups, </p><p>and religious backgrounds. </p><p> </p><p>Objectives:  During 2003-4, the KDC is forming chapters in </p><p>the five geographic regions where Karen people are </p><p>concentrated, and is seeking financial assistance to </p><p>undertake the objectives of: </p><p> </p><p>-- Planning and establishing the KDC regional networks of </p><p>people in these areas to undertake social organizing, </p><p>encourage dialogue between intra-ethnic factions, and </p><p>implement development projects; and </p><p> </p><p>-- Conducting workshops in the regions on topics which could </p><p>include social organizing; civic education; peace education; </p><p>planning for development projects; the faces of power; and </p><p>women and development. </p><p> </p><p>The Karen Development Committee has the capacity to provide </p><p>for accounting, monitoring and reporting for the use of any </p><p>funds received. </p><p> </p><p>Budget:  US$15,000 is requested for one year. </p><p> </p><p>End text of proposals. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
