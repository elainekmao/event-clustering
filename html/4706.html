<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 RANGOON 001592 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR INL AND EAP </p><p>USCINCPAC FOR FPA </p><p>NSC FOR BEERS </p><p>DEA FOR OF, OFF </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/02/2012 </p><p>TAGS: SNAR, PTER, PINS, BM </p><p>SUBJECT:  DRUGS, THUGS AND FACTS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. (A) BANGKOK 8488 </p><p>     B. (B) BANGKOK 08493 </p><p>     C. (C) CHIANG MAI 0302 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: COM Carmen Martinez. Reason: 1.5 (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: Embassy Rangoon wants to provide </p><p>clarification and counterpoint to reftels reporting on Burma </p><p>counterterrorism and counternarcotics issues. When discussing </p><p>drugs and thugs, accurate information is absolutely crucial </p><p>to framing USG counternarcotics stategy in the context of </p><p>Burma-Thai relations.  Reftels draw some unwarranted </p><p>conclusions that distort the discussion of narcotics and </p><p>terrorism issues in Burma and Thailand. Post also encourages </p><p>more support for Burmese/Thai cooperation on the </p><p>methamphetamine problem as, in contrast to opium (which is </p><p>being attacked effectively at its source in Burma), it is a </p><p>regional problem which must be dealt with through regional </p><p>strategies. The Thaksin government appears to understand this </p><p>but, to judge from recent reports, that understanding is not </p><p>yet wide-spread within the ranks of Thai officials.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Terrorism </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Reftel A concludes that the evidence suggests the SPDC </p><p>is bombing Burmese embassies as part of a "dirty tricks" </p><p>campaign against pro-democracy groups in Thailand. There is </p><p>no doubt that defaming these groups is a priority for the </p><p>SPDC. However, more facts, and an examination of the motives </p><p>of all parties involved, are needed before basing such a </p><p>conclusion solely on information provided by an FTUB (Free </p><p>Trade Union of Burma) contact with "allies" at the Thai NSC. </p><p>Right now, saying the letter bombs are just "dirty tricks" is </p><p>unwarranted. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Two points in particular stand out.  First, aside </p><p>from initial press mention of the  receipt of the letter </p><p>bombs, the GOB has not heavily publicized the mail bombing </p><p>campaign against their embassies. If the SPDC was trying to </p><p>blame the FTUB or any other Thai based pro-democracy groups, </p><p>one can bet they would be mounting one of their heavy-handed </p><p>media blitzes and accusing those groups of terrorist acts. </p><p>Secondly, the reason the GOB has not turned the bombs over to </p><p>the Thais is because, according to our sources, the bombs </p><p>were either destroyed (in some cases), or turned over to the </p><p>host-country authorities where the targeted Burmese embassies </p><p>are located. These embassy letter bombings are now under </p><p>investigation by Burmese and, according to Ref A, Thai </p><p>authorities. Once that investigation is complete the guilty </p><p>parties  can be named. Right now the word of the FTUB should </p><p>not be considered the final word on the letter bomb incidents. </p><p> </p><p>Counternarcotics </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Comments by high ranking RTA officials that the </p><p>Burmese army is flooding Thailand with a billion tablets of </p><p>methamphetamines have morphed from allegations to "fact". </p><p>Although the "billion tablet" allegations were subsequently </p><p>denied in the press by RTA spokesmen, that number has become </p><p>imbedded in the Burma-Thai counternarcotics discussion  and </p><p>it distorts any clear picture of Burmese counternarcotics </p><p>efforts as well as Thai interdiction programs. In Ref B, </p><p>Bangkok reports discussing the RTA statement with senior Thai </p><p>ONCB officials who are quoted as telling Bangkok NAS that </p><p>"any estimates of next year\'s amphetamine production were </p><p>obviously based on speculation and varied widely" (the RTA </p><p>officials\' predictions of one billion methamphetamine pills </p><p>into Thailand this year is also incompatible with available </p><p>data from DEA and ONCB). According to Reftel C, seizures in </p><p>Thailand\'s northern provinces totaled  about 22 million pills </p><p> - a number that suggests either unusually inept Thai </p><p>interdiction efforts or that the flow of methamphetamines is </p><p>well below a billion tablets. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  Comment: When discussing drugs and thugs, accurate </p><p>information is always absolutely crucial to framing USG </p><p>counternarcotics and counterterrorism strategy - so should it </p><p>be in discussing these issues in the regional context of </p><p>Burma and Thailand. Post offers our views as counterpoint and </p><p>clarification to reftels and makes this observation: in </p><p>contrast to opium, which is being attacked effectively at its </p><p>source in Burma, methamphetamine production and trafficking </p><p>are regional problems and they must be treated through </p><p>regional strategies and cooperation. The same applies to </p><p>counterterrorism efforts. The Thaksin government appears to </p><p>understand this but, to judge from recent reports, that </p><p>understanding is not yet wide-spread within the ranks of Thai </p><p>officials.  End Comment. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
