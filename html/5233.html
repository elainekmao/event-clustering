Reasons:  1.5 (B and </p><p>D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C)  DCM delivered Ref A points concerning the Turkish </p><p>peace initiative to the Prime Minister\'s Diplomatic Advisor </p><p>Turkoglu and to MFA Director General for the Middle East </p><p>Burcuoglu on 1/20.  They each welcomed our views and </p><p>reiterated that it is the GOT\'s intent to send a strong </p><p>message to Iraq on the need to comply with the UNSCRs.  They </p><p>noted scheduling problems in achieving the desired summit and </p><p>said that the Jan. 23 meeting may be a preparatory session. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) On the issue of Kuwait each said that Kuwait\'s absence </p><p>was intentional.  The Turks believed the initiative would be </p><p>more effective that way.  Burcuoglu went on to characterize </p><p>Kuwait as a party to the conflict with Iraq and therefore </p><p>lacking potential to add weight to the initiative with the </p><p>Iraqi\'s.  He noted that Iran had argued in favor of including </p><p>Kuwait while the Syrians were opposed.  Since the subject was </p><p>controversial, he said it was best to levave the Kuwaitis </p><p>out.  Burcuoglu said he had discussed the question with the </p><p>Kuwaiti Ambassador here and that the GOK did not object to </p><p>the formulation.  Turkey welcomed Kuwait\'s understanding. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) DCM responded that considering Kuwait a party to the </p><p>"conflict" and therefore disqualified was just the kind of </p><p>"balance" we were concerned could creep into any declaration. </p><p> This was not a conflict between Iraq and Kuwait, or Iraq and </p><p>the US.  It was a threat to international peace that </p><p>concerned all of us.  In seeking to find a peaceful </p><p>resolution, there could be no equivalence between Iraq\'s </p><p>responsibility and the international community\'s right to </p><p>insist on full compliance and cooperation. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
