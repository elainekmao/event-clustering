Ozkok and army commanders called on Prime Minister </p><p>Erdogan and opposition leader  Baykal on Monday.  The </p><p>meetings came after Erdogan and Baykal issued statements </p><p>urging intervention in the region.  Ozkok reportedly said </p><p>that deploying Turkish troops despite warnings by the U.S. </p><p>would be perceived as declaration of war on the U.S.-led </p><p>coalition.  According to papers, the military believes that </p><p>the U.S. might seek cooperation with Turkey to avoid </p><p>problems encountered on the Southern Front, that a Turkish </p><p>air corridor might be used to transfer troops to Northern </p><p>Iraq, that the U.S. might need Turkish military support to </p><p>place heavy weapons in Northern Iraq, and that the U.S. may </p><p>seek the use of Turkish airbases.  Military commanders see </p><p>an incursion into Iraq as unnecessary for the time being, </p><p>but they say that deployment of a peacekeeping force might </p><p>be considered.  General Ozkok is expected to hold a press </p><p>conference in the border town of Silopi on Tuesday (Note: </p><p>the press conference was subsequently canceled and </p><p>rescheduled for tomorrow in Diyarbakir.  End note.) </p><p>"Radikal" reports an anonymous high-level government </p><p>official as saying that a new motion for cooperation with </p><p>the U.S. might be in the offing.  The U.S. conveyed to </p><p>Turkey on Sunday a request for access to Turkish bases -- </p><p>namely Incirlik, Diyarbakir, Batman, and Malatya -- and the </p><p>government and TGS are examining the technical aspects of </p><p>the issue.  Papers report that U.S. envoy for Iraq Khalilzad </p><p>and General Colby Broadwater held meetings with MFA </p><p>officials to discuss the conditions for Turkish military </p><p>action in Northern Iraq.  Khalilzad said that the U.S. would </p><p>not object to `cooperating\' with Turkish military action in </p><p>the region.  He warned Turkey not to set up closed security </p><p>zones that would give the impression of military occupation, </p><p>and insisted that any troops be withdrawn as soon as the </p><p>refugee and security threats are over.  Kurdish groups are </p><p>against such a deal between the U.S. and Turkey, and the </p><p>search for an acceptable agreement continues.  Greek Foreign </p><p>Minister Papandreou said Iraq\'s neighbors should not get </p><p>involved in the war, while a Greek government spokesman </p><p>voiced Athens\' concern about Turkish efforts to `occupy </p><p>Northern Iraq.\'  In a front page story, "Radikal" says that </p><p>U.S. forces are landing in Northern Iraq to fight together </p><p>with KDP peshmerge stationed near Mosul, and PUK fighters </p><p>near Kirkuk. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JP Morgan on Turkey: "Hurriyet" carries a JP Morgan </p><p>investment report claiming that  Turkey has sufficient </p><p>resources to handle its debt repayment in the next six </p><p>months without U.S. financial assistance.  The report </p><p>estimates one percent growth for Turkey in 2003, and three </p><p>percent in 2004, and stresses that the AKP government still </p><p>has a chance to secure macroeconomic and structural </p><p>discipline.  JP Morgan also warned that a possible 25 </p><p>decrease in tourism revenues and border trade due to the </p><p>Iraqi war might adversely affect the 2003 growth target. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION:  War in Iraq </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Law is patience" </p><p>Oktay Eksi wrote in mass appeal Hurriyet (3/25): "President </p><p>Bush calls on the Iraqi regime to comply with the Geneva </p><p>Conventions on treatment of POWs.  He is very right by </p><p>referring to the Geneva Conventions on this issue.  Yet </p><p>something is just not right.  President Bush remains at the </p><p>top of the list of `leaders who blatantly violate </p><p>international law.\'  However, he now calls on others to </p><p>comply with international law and regulations.  . One </p><p>wonders if the Geneva Conventions are binding for Iraq and </p><p>not for the US." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Shock and horror" </p><p>Erhan Basyurt wrote in the Islamic-intellectual Zaman </p><p>(3/25): "The US operation in Iraq has been named `shock and </p><p>horror.\'  However, the course of the action shows that the </p><p>`shock\' part went to the coalition forces due to an </p><p>unexpectedly stiff resistance.  . There are two major </p><p>reasons why the Iraqis resist despite the US intention of </p><p>freeing the Iraqi people and bring democracy.  The US </p><p>conducted a well-prepared psychological war campaign in the </p><p>media prior to the operation, but none of the messages got </p><p>through to the people of Iraq.  A people living without </p><p>satellite dishes or internet access does not know anything </p><p>about the real world.  The Iraqis still believe that they </p><p>are fighting against British colonial forces, which they </p><p>fought for independence, or against the new superpower, </p><p>which is after oil.  It seems that Saddam\'s regime has </p><p>successfully managed to inject this psychology into the </p><p>minds of the Iraqi people." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Northern Iraq" </p><p>Sami Kohen noted in mass appeal Milliyet (3/25): "The </p><p>northern Iraq issue has become a problem not only for </p><p>Turkey, but also on the international agenda. . In an effort </p><p>to clarify misunderstandings, Turkey should be persuasive </p><p>and clear about its long-term policies in northern Iraq. </p><p>Turkey\'s insistence on deploying troops in northern Iraq is </p><p>interpreted as part of an effort to control the Kurds. . </p><p>There is speculation about Turkey\'s strategy for the Kurds </p><p>in the region, with some saying that Turkey would not object </p><p>to a federal structure where Iraqi Kurds can enjoy a certain </p><p>degree of autonomy.  We just don\'t know whether this is true </p><p>or not, however, because the northern Iraq issue has not </p><p>been clarified by Ankara policy-makers." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
