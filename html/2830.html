<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 000828 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS AND DS/OP/NEA </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PTER, ASEC, PGOV, CASC, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: MAOISTS ATTACK CIVILIAN VEHICLES AS COMPLIANCE </p><p>WITH GENERAL STRIKE ERODES </p><p> </p><p>REFS: A) KATHMANDU 813, B) KATHMANDU 804 </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary.  Kathmandu continued to move toward </p><p>normalcy on the fourth day of the Maoists\' five-day </p><p>general strike with traffic even heavier than yesterday. </p><p>A bomb went off April 26 injuring two on a bus about one </p><p>kilometer from the Embassy, while on April 25 Maoists </p><p>bombed a private residence and a taxi, wounding the driver </p><p>and a passer-by.  Police arrested one man carrying a bomb </p><p>in his jacket.  A local journalist who canvassed Kathmandu </p><p>Valley residents during the strike found increasing </p><p>frustration at the costs the insurgency levied on working </p><p>people and the economy.  Post confirmed as false press </p><p>reports that on April 25 Maoists had left a bomb on the </p><p>street near the Embassy and had attacked remote Red Cross </p><p>and foreign aid offices and a Kathmandu orphanage.  By </p><p>bombing public conveyances the Maoists hope to make good </p><p>on their promises to enforce the strike, but so far to </p><p>little effect.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Fourth Day Busier, But Marred By Bombings </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) April 26 marked the fourth day of a five-day </p><p>general strike, or "bandh," called by Maoist insurgents. </p><p>Traffic in the capital was heavier than previous days, </p><p>more shops were open, and more people were out in the </p><p>street (Reftels).  A mid-day lull caused by heavy rains </p><p>from a Spring storm was broken, violently, by a bombing in </p><p>the vicinity of the private residence of Nepal\'s King and </p><p>the Embassy. </p><p> </p><p>Maoists Attack Public Conveyances in Kathmandu </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) The bomb exploded on a public bus at about 3:00 </p><p>p.m. April 26 as it plied a main road in front of </p><p>Kathmandu\'s Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital, </p><p>approximately 100 meters south of the King\'s private home </p><p>and one kilometer north of the Embassy.  Two pedestrians </p><p>suffered minor injuries and were seen at the nearby </p><p>emergency room, according to a teaching hospital official. </p><p>[Note:  Initial reports had three passengers wounded.]  At </p><p>around 6:00 p.m. April 25, a bomb went off in a taxi in </p><p>the Dhalkhu area of the capital.  The driver and a 15-year- </p><p>old pedestrian were wounded.  Three people, including one </p><p>woman, had hailed the driver, instructed him to take them </p><p>to an intersection, and asked him to wait while they went </p><p>to meet a friend.  After about five minutes a bomb they </p><p>had left behind in the taxi went off. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Also on April 25, a bomb exploded outside a private </p><p>residence in the city center, causing slight damage to a </p><p>perimeter wall.  On the same day police arrested a Maoist </p><p>concealing a socket bomb in his jacket as he walked along </p><p>a main road in the Boudha neighborhood. </p><p> </p><p>More Citizens Stand Up </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) In another show of defiance against the Maoists, a </p><p>trade group organized a motorcycle rally April 26 to </p><p>protest the 5-day general strike.  A journalist for </p><p>Nepal\'s leading daily newspaper told Poloff that he and </p><p>his colleagues had spent the second and third days of the </p><p>bandh criss-crossing the Kathmandu Valley on motorcycles </p><p>talking to local residents, including bus and taxi </p><p>drivers, storekeepers, farmers and students.  They found a </p><p>population increasingly angry at the Maoists\' actions and </p><p>frustrated by the mounting toll the insurgency was taking </p><p>on the economy.  Many found it increasingly difficult to </p><p>feed themselves and their families. </p><p> </p><p>Bad Press </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) Misinformation carried the day April 26 at Nepal\'s </p><p>English-language newspapers.  The front page of the </p><p>Himalayan Times featured a sidebar on a bomb that had </p><p>allegedly been defused by security forces only 100 meters </p><p>north of the Embassy.  In fact, police sources told us, a </p><p>suspicious package thought to be a bomb was found in the </p><p>street, but when security forces attempted to neutralize </p><p>it with explosives, that package turned out to contain </p><p>only garbage.  The April 26 Kathmandu Post carried an </p><p>erroneous story alleging that Maoists had attacked the </p><p>Tehrathum district offices of German and British </p><p>development agencies and the Nepal Red Cross.  In </p><p>actuality, Maoists had attacked a field office of an NGO - </p><p>the Demali Society - affiliated with those organizations. </p><p>Nothing on display would identify Demali as an affiliate </p><p>of the Red Cross or other organization, however. </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) An incident involving a bomb at an orphanage </p><p>reported in the press and by police (Ref A) also turned </p><p>out to be exaggerated.  On April 25 Maoists threw a petrol </p><p>bomb at a small bus traveling on Kathmandu\'s ring road. </p><p>The bottle missed its target and smashed on the pavement. </p><p>The perpetrators attempted to run away, but were chased by </p><p>locals - and reportedly some of the orphans - into a </p><p>building near the orphanage.  Police arrived and took the </p><p>bombers into custody.  The press reported, erroneously, </p><p>that the bomb had been defused inside the orphanage. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) By setting off bombs on taxis and buses, the </p><p>Maoists are trying to make good on their promise to </p><p>enforce the bandh.  Their actions have not yet had the </p><p>desired effect, however, as following the well-publicized </p><p>April 25 taxi blast, even more cabs hit the street April </p><p>26.  As the journalists\' informal poll shows, Kathmandu </p><p>residents have become increasingly frustrated with the </p><p>costs the Maoists have imposed on Nepal\'s economy, </p><p>society, and reputation.  Many have begun to assert their </p><p>rights, and many more have decided to get on with life </p><p>despite the Maoists\' threats. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
