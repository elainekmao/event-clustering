THE 25TH MEETING OF </p><p>THE FAO COMMITTEE ON FISHERIES (COFI), DISAPPOINTED WITH </p><p>THE SLOW PROGRESS TOWARDS USEFUL ANALYSIS OF THE </p><p>RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SUBSIDIES AND EXCESS FISHING </p><p>CAPACITY AND BETWEEN SUBSIDIES AND IUU FISHING, HAD GIVEN </p><p>FAO CONSIDERABLE GUIDANCE IN HOW TO PROCEED. </p><p> </p><p>3. THE CONSULTANT\'S PRESENTATION CENTERED ON HOW TO APPLY </p><p>THE GUIDANCE FROM COFI TO THE PROBLEM THROUGH A CLASSIC </p><p>APPROACH TO STUDY DESIGN.  THIS INCLUDED:  (1) STATING </p><p>THE MANDATE FOR THE STUDY AND THE "FRAMEWORK" WITHIN </p><p>WHICH IT WOULD BE APPLIED; (2) LISTING THE QUESTIONS TO </p><p>BE ANSWERED BY THE STUDY; (3) DESCRIBING THE METHODOLOGY; </p><p>(4) DESCRIBING THE EXPECTED RESULTS; AND (5) BY PROVIDING </p><p>A LIST OF ISSUES TO BE DISCUSSED BY THE AD HOC MEETING TO </p><p>TEST THE STUDY DESIGN AND TO SEE IF OTHER WORK, ALREADY </p><p>    COMPLETED OR IN PROGRESS IN IGOS, MIGHT BE RELEVANT. </p><p> </p><p>4.
