IN JANUARY 2003, THE GOI ANNOUNCED THAT THE PUBLIC </p><p>SECTOR DEFICIT DECREASED BY 25 PERCENT FROM END-2001 </p><p>TO END-2002.  THE IMPROVEMENT RESULTED FROM A </p><p>POSTPONEMENT OF PAYMENTS (SPENDING CAPS WERE IMPOSED </p><p>ON GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURES) AND FROM ANTICIPATED </p><p>REVENUES OF E9.1 BILLION IN REAL ESTATE SALES. WE </p><p>PREDICT THE 2002 DEFICIT/GDP WAS 2.4 PERCENT, ALTHOUGH </p><p>THE GOI ESTIMATES THAT THE 2002 DEFICIT/GDP RATIO WAS </p><p>2.2 PERCENT (SLIGHTLY ABOVE THE GOI TARGET OF 2.1 </p><p>PERCENT).  AN E40 BILLION SWAP IN TREASURY BONDS ALSO </p><p>IS THOUGHT TO HAVE REDUCED THE DEBT/GDP RATIO TO </p><p>AROUND 108-109 PERCENT.  THE GOIS SALE OF ITS </p><p>REMAINING 3.5 PERCENT STAKE IN TELECOM ITALIA, WHICH </p><p>BROUGHT IN E1.4 BILLION IN REVENUES, ALSO IMPROVED THE </p><p>DEBT/GDP RATIO. </p><p> </p><p>23. EU ECONOMIC AND MONETARY AFFAIRS COMMISSIONER </p><p>PEDRO SOLBES HAS CRITICIZED ITALY FOR ITS FREQUENT USE </p><p>OF ONE-TIME MEASURES, SUCH AS TAX AMNESTIES. (ONE-TIME </p><p>MEASURES HAVE RISEN FROM 0.7 PERCENT TO 1.2 PERCENT OF </p><p>GDP.)  THE COMMISSION ALSO HAS EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT </p><p>THE SUSTAINABILITY OF ITALYS FISCAL ADJUSTMENT. ITS </p><p>E20 BILLION 2003 DEFICIT REDUCTION PACKAGE RELIES </p><p>MOSTLY ON THESE ONE-TIME MEASURES AND  SECURITIZATION </p><p>OF STATE-OWNED ASSETS, RATHER THAN ON MORE SUSTAINABLE </p><p>STRUCTURAL CHANGE.

FOR THIS </p><p>REASON, THE COMMISSION IS URGING ITALY TO CONSIDER A </p><p>SUPPLEMENTAL BUDGET PACKAGE, WITH STRONG DEFICIT </p><p>CUTTING MEASURES, BEFORE MARCH. (NOTE: MID-MARCH IS </p><p>THE DEADLINE FOR ITALYS TAX AMNESTY, WHICH, ACCORDING </p><p>TO GOI CALCULATIONS, IS EXPECTED TO PRODUCE E8 BILLION </p><p>IN ADDITIONAL REVENUES.

IN A RECENT REPORT ON ITALYS ECONOMY, MORGAN </p><p>STANLEY ESTIMATED THAT 60 PERCENT OF THE DEFICIT </p><p>REDUCTION PACKAGE IS BASED ON TAX AMNESTIES AND THE </p><p>SALE OF REAL ESTATE (PRESENTED AS SECURITIZED ASSETS). </p><p>THE DEBT/GDP RATIO IS CLOSER TO 110 PERCENT, ACCORDING </p><p>TO MORGAN STANLEY.

DATA </p><p>FROM THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENTS RESEARCH DIVISION, </p><p>N, </p><p>ISTAT, SHOW THAT SLIGHTLY HIGHER EXPORTS AND </p><p>PRIVATE/PUBLIC CONSUMPTION, UP 0.2 PERCENT AND 1.6 </p><p>PERCENT RESPECTIVELY, SUPPORTED GDP GROWTH FROM THE </p><p>SECOND TO THIRD QUARTER.  HOWEVER, FOR THE FIRST NINE </p><p>MONTHS OF 2002, INVESTMENT (MOSTLY IN MACHINERY AND </p><p>EQUIPMENT) FELL OVERALL BY 1.4 PERCENT; EXPORTS ALSO </p><p>DECLINED 1.1 PERCENT.
