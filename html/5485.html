MERVAN GUL WITHDRAWS FROM SIIRT ELECTIONS </p><p>(All papers)  Mervan Gul of AK Party has withdrawn </p><p>from the March 9 Siirt elections.  Gul had been </p><p>elected to the Parliament in the November 3 </p><p>elections, but lost his status as a Member of </p><p>Parliament after the Siirt elections were </p><p>cancelled.  Gul declared he would resign to open </p><p>the way for AK Party leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan. </p><p>"My party will make the decision regarding my </p><p>candidacy," Erdogan said.  Milli Gazete reported </p><p>Gul submitted a petition regarding his withdrawal </p><p>from the March 9 Siirt elections to the Higher </p><p>Election Council (YSK) on January 31.  According to </p><p>Radikal newspaper, the Republican People\'s Party </p><p>(CHP) has changed its list of Siirt candidates to </p><p>attract votes of DEHAP members in Siirt.  Turkiye </p><p>and Radikal reported the February 1 acceptance of </p><p>Gul\'s resignation by YSK. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  CONTINUED ANTI-WAR SENTIMENTS IN THE SOUTHEAST </p><p>(Milli Gazete/Bolge)  The Adana Art Council issued </p><p>an anti-war handbill declaration "Let There Not Be </p><p>Wars."  Representatives of various NGO\'s had signed </p><p>the declaration.  The declaration read:  "There are </p><p>efforts to re-draw paintings of blood and horror </p><p>over Iraqi territories.  Turkey and its neighbor </p><p>Iraq is being pulled toward a catastrophe during </p><p>which hundreds of people will die, children will </p><p>become orphans, and families broken.  We want </p><p>neither this nor another war.  We believe that it </p><p>is possible for humanity, which is able to reason </p><p>and talk, to solve its problems by way of </p><p>understanding and compromise."  The Diyarbakir </p><p>Democratic Youth Platform held a press conference </p><p>during which it declared it would stand against the </p><p>possible U.S.-led war in Iraq.  Evrensel reported </p><p>Adana merchants, including a Turkish veteran of the </p><p>Korean War, objected to fighting on the same side </p><p>with the U.S.  According to Milli Gazete, the nine- </p><p>person Oral family of Iskenderun (Hatay) declared </p><p>they would serve as human shields during any </p><p>possible U.S.-led war in Iraq.  Edip Oral, father </p><p>of former President Suleyman Demirel\'s adopted </p><p>daughter, is known for his anti-war struggle in the </p><p>region. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  TROOPS DISPATCHED TO IRAQI BORDER </p><p>(Evrensel)  Many soldiers and village guards </p><p>affiliated with the Van Regiment Command have been </p><p>dispatched to the Iraqi border within the framework </p><p>of a possible U.S.-led operation against Iraq.  A </p><p>convoy of 100 vehicles, including ambulances, left </p><p>for Semdinli (Hakkari).  Turkiye and Sabah reported </p><p>the dispatch by train of 800 soldiers from the </p><p>(Istanbul-based) First Army to the Iraqi border. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  FIRST TENTS ALONG IRAQI BORDER </p><p>(Hurriyet)  Turkey is trying to prevent a possible </p><p>Iraq operation, while it continues to take measures </p><p>against a possible influx of refugees in the event </p><p>of war.  Soldiers and village guards, together with </p><p>Red Crescent Society officials, have begun to set </p><p>up tents in Silopi (Sirnak) two kilometers away </p><p>from the Iraqi border.  Some military units have </p><p>also been transferred to open fields along the </p><p>border, with soldiers settling in tents and </p><p>barracks hidden among trees.  Leaves of public </p><p>employees likely to be used in the event of a war </p><p>have been suspended.  Tents were set up on January </p><p>31 in Silopi, where the number of these tents is </p><p>expected to reach 1,000 in the upcoming days.  The </p><p>tents reportedly accommodate 5-6 people each.  An </p><p>exercise is also scheduled for February 5 in </p><p>preparation for a possible wave of refugees. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.

Answering journalists\' questions on Cyprus </p><p>and Iraq, Baykal criticized government policies. </p><p>Cumhuriyet cited Baykal as saying that Turkey would </p><p>suffer due to a possible Iraq war.  "There is </p><p>neither a legal, nor political nor ethical basis </p><p>for this war," Baykal argued. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  GOVERNORS\' CIRCULAR </p><p>(Turkiye/Hurriyet/Milliyet/Sabah)  President Ahmet </p><p>Necdet Sezer approved a circular regarding the </p><p>appointment of 88 governors across the country. </p><p>Under the circular, the State of Emergency (OHAL) </p><p>Regional Governor, Gokhan Aydiner, was appointed </p><p>the National Security Director, while National </p><p>Security Director Kemal Onal was appointed Adana </p><p>Governor.

AK PARTY MARDIN DISTRICT OFFICE BOMBED </p><p>(Evrensel)  A Molotov cocktail was thrown at the </p><p>Kiziltepe (Mardin) chapter of the Justice and </p><p>Development Party (AKP).  The explosion resulted in </p><p>a fire that caused damage amounting to TL 15 </p><p>billion (approx. USD 9,100).  Firemen put out the </p><p>fire, while an operation is underway to find the </p><p>assailants. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.

PRO-OCALAN HUNGER STRIKES CONTINUE </p><p>Evrensel reported continued hunger strikes in </p><p>protest of the isolation of jailed KADEK/PKK leader </p><p>Abdullah Ocalan over the past nine weeks.  Van </p><p>police intervened to disperse a group of 300 high </p><p>school students protesting Ocalan\'s isolation and </p><p>arrested many of them.  Pro-Ocalan protests were </p><p>also held in Batman, Diyarbakir, Sanliurfa, Siirt </p><p>and Hakkari.  Attorney Sezgin Tanrikulu, President </p><p>of the Diyarbakir Bar Association, issued a joint </p><p>statement by the presidents of Bar Associations in </p><p>the East and Southeast.  The statement </p><p>characterized isolation of prisoners and inmates </p><p>and refusal for them to meet with their attorneys </p><p>and relatives as "unlawful."  Amnesty Internation </p><p>demanded the removal of isolation imposed on </p><p>Ocalan. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  RADIO OFFICIAL UNDER INVESTIGATION FOR KURDISH </p><p>     BROADCASTING </p><p>(Evrensel)  Sabri Ejder Ozic, Director of Adana\'s </p><p>Radio Dunya, was summoned to the Adana Prosecutor\'s </p><p>Office for his station\'s airing of Kurdish-language </p><p>programs.  Ozic said the radio had broadcast the </p><p>programming due to local demand but then ended it </p><p>out of its own accord.  Ozic added that the station </p><p>had been previously closed for having aired </p><p>Kurdish-language music. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13.

He added that his theater was staging </p><p>children\'s plays in nearly all Eastern and </p><p>Southeastern provinces every year.  The Gaziantep </p><p>ban had stemmed from a lack of a closed-circuit </p><p>camera system in the hall. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14.  BATMAN INMATES MIGHT BE TRANSFERRED TO OTHER </p><p>     PROVINCES </p><p>(Evrensel)  In an effort to decrease the number of </p><p>inmates in the Batman Prison, prison officials </p><p>circulated an announcement foreseeing the transfer </p><p>of some of the inmates to other provinces. </p><p>Presently, there are over 500 inmates in the 250- </p><p>person prison.  Thus far, only four of the inmates </p><p>have agreed to be transferred to other provinces. </p><p>Officials noted that inmates were reluctant to move </p><p>because their families are all in Batman. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15.

When he looked up in </p><p>the sky, he wanted to see cargo planes with export </p><p>products and factories whose chimneys are smoking, </p><p>not war planes, he said.  Bas, together with ACOC </p><p>members, went to the province\'s Organized </p><p>Industrial Zone to inspect developments there and </p><p>receive information from officials.  Currently, 167 </p><p>factories are operational and 85 others are under </p><p>construction at the zone.  Another 110 new </p><p>factories are at the planning stage. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>19.
