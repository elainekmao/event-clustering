AMMAN 2072 </p><p>     B. 01 AMMAN 5288 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMBASSADOR EDWARD W. GNEHM, REASONS 1.5 (B,D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (u)  This cable has been coordinated with Embassy Tel </p><p>Aviv. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (sbu)  There is little evidence of systemic negative </p><p>impacts on the QIZ\'s from the war, although there have been </p><p>isolated instances of order cancellations.  Although the </p><p>government is concerned that cancellations may mount and new </p><p>orders stall, more disconcerting to exporters was the </p><p>days-long closure of the Sheikh Hussein bridge due to Israeli </p><p>customs strikes.  While we continue to be optimistic about </p><p>the ability of QIZ\'s to get through the current crisis, the </p><p>impact of the strikes is likely to encourage QIZ exporters to </p><p>switch from QIZ to FTA exports, once tariff breaks equalize. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>QIZ\'s REPORT FEW PROBLEMS FROM WAR </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (sbu)  We have regularly canvassed QIZ exporters, park </p><p>managers, and the Trade Ministry since the beginning of the </p><p>war to track any impact on QIZ businesses.  In the run-up to </p><p>the war, Costandi Yaghnam of El Zay menswear (a suit </p><p>manufacturer) informed us of a decision by one of his clients </p><p>to cancel a substantial order.  It remains unclear, though, </p><p>after follow-up activities by the Embassy, Washington </p><p>agencies, and the Jordanian Embassy in Washington, whether </p><p>this cancellation was a result of war uncertainty or a more </p><p>straightforward business decision. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (sbu)  We also received word from one QIZ exporter at Al </p><p>Tajammouat industrial park outside Amman that several April </p><p>orders from one of his U.S. importers had been canceled due </p><p>to war uncertainty.  This same exporter later told us that </p><p>"the worst has passed," and that he is fully booked for May </p><p>orders from the same client, and he expects a good summer </p><p>season.  He added that the lack of noticeable impact from the </p><p>war on QIZ exports has served to bolster both importer and </p><p>exporter confidence about continuing business. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (sbu)  Aside from these two cases, we have uncovered no </p><p>significant negative impact from the war on current QIZ </p><p>exports.  Air and sea freight charges have increased, but </p><p>insurance companies have not imposed war risk insurance.  Sea </p><p>and air ports remain open, and there has been no labor unrest </p><p>or other demonstration activity at QIZ parks to slow the work </p><p>of exporters (though exporters report a glum mood among </p><p>Jordanian staff as a result of the war).  We have heard from </p><p>at least one park manager and one independent QIZ watcher </p><p>that expressions of interest from potential new investors are </p><p>still coming in, and the manager of the Al Tajammouat park </p><p>tells us construction and make-ready for newly-contracted </p><p>factory space continues on schedule.  In addition, the </p><p>regional Target representative based in Cairo told us her </p><p>company continues to place orders in Jordan and views the QIZ </p><p>initiative very favorably. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>PM VOICES CONCERN </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (c)  Prime Minister Abul Ragheb told the Ambassador April </p><p>6 that an increasing number of reports were surfacing of </p><p>canceled QIZ orders and reduced volumes of new orders (ref </p><p>a).  Trade Minister Bashir reiterated those concerns to the </p><p>Ambassador on April 8.  The Ambassador told both the PM and </p><p>Trade Minister that we have received a few reports of order </p><p>cancellations (noted above), but that the volumes were not </p><p>yet unexpectedly high.  The Ambassador assured the ministers </p><p>that we are keeping close, regular tabs on QIZ developments, </p><p>and that Washington agencies have already met with U.S. </p><p>garment importers to impress upon them our continued support </p><p>for the QIZ initiative.  He added that both Washington </p><p>agencies and the Embassy have offered to talk to any U.S. </p><p>importers who have concerns or questions about the QIZ\'s. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>STRIKES - THE REAL ISSUE </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>7.  (sbu)  Of far more concern to QIZ exporters is a strike </p><p>by Israeli customs employees that has crippled traffic across </p><p>the Sheikh Hussein bridge in both directions for more than a </p><p>week.  A number of QIZ exporters have complained to us that </p><p>they are unable to import necessary Israeli product inputs to </p><p>complete outstanding orders.  One factory owner said he was </p><p>temporarily operating at half-staff pending delivery of an </p><p>order of Israeli zippers need to fill his 8% quota and finish </p><p>his order.  According to park managers, trucks loaded with </p><p>outbound cargo are increasingly visible outside factories, </p><p>where they have been waiting for several days to get </p><p>clearance to cross to Israel to continue on to Haifa. </p><p>Meanwhile, Israel\'s Deputy Head of Customs spoke out very </p><p>strongly against strikes impacting QIZ business in </p><p>conversations with Tel Aviv ECONOFF April 4.  He said it was </p><p>in Israel\'s national interest that this trade move forward </p><p>and that he would speak to the appropriate Histadrut (union) </p><p>people about it.  According to Jordanian bridge officials, </p><p>bridge traffic was still severely restricted as of April 8, </p><p>with only a handful of trucks cleared (though 80 trucks </p><p>cleared on April 7). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (sbu)  Trade Ministry officials told us April 9 that </p><p>their chief concern is not cancellations, but a slowdown in </p><p>new orders for the summer based on a perception of regional </p><p>instability from the war - a perception that is keeping </p><p>critical Quality Control and Compliance officers from </p><p>visiting Jordan to supervise orders.  We are talking to the </p><p>Ministry to ascertain their approach to building importer </p><p>confidence, and will coordinate a strategy with Washington to </p><p>support their efforts. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (sbu)  Meanwhile, the problems at the bridge - while </p><p>unconnected to the war - have put both QIZ exporters and the </p><p>GOJ on edge.  This is not the first bridge closure related to </p><p>Israeli labor issues (ref b), and it underscores the degree </p><p>to which the Jordanian and Israeli textile sectors have </p><p>become entwined through the QIZ initiative.In the long term, </p><p>the problems caused by the strikes are likely to drive QIZ </p><p>exporters to export more goods under the FTA as soon as </p><p>tariff benefits under the two programs approach parity.  This </p><p>switch to FTA export is even more likely when one factors in </p><p>the production cost savings of using Asian, rather than </p><p>Israeli, inputs.  Israel may find itself scrambling to keep </p><p>QIZ business as time goes on, barring changes to their price </p><p>structure, improved reliability of bridge access, and/or </p><p>changes to the way the Israeli inputs are calculated (i.e., </p><p>either reducing the 8% requirement or moving to a sliding </p><p>scale that would allow more expensive garments to have a </p><p>lower percentage of Israeli content, either of which would </p><p>reduce QIZ production costs). </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
