<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 THE HAGUE 001597 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: UPON ANNOUNCEMENT BY OSD-ASD (PA) </p><p>TAGS: MARR, PREL, NL </p><p>SUBJECT: BASE REALIGNMENT - ROUND 31 CONSULTATIONS </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 101373 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Mary Daly for reasons 1.5 (B) & (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S) Per reftel we notified the GONL of our desire to </p><p>begin consultations on facilities in Brunssum and </p><p>Vriezenveen.  In response, the NL Ministry of Defense </p><p>requested face-to-face consultations to be conducted with MG </p><p>van der List, Director for Personal and Organization, Royal </p><p>Netherlands Army.  Following these consultations, the GONL </p><p>responded formally via letter to ODC Chief Col. Rumohr.  Text </p><p>follows. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S) BEGIN TEXT: Pursuant to what we discussed on  6 June, </p><p>this is to inform you about our points of view with regard to </p><p>the intended closure of the APS sites in The Netherlands by </p><p>the United States of America: </p><p> </p><p>The Netherlands Ministry of Defense is aware of the fact that </p><p>the reduction of APS activities has been going on for a </p><p>number of years and that possible consequences for the Dutch </p><p>sites could be anticipated. </p><p> </p><p>The 30 September 2003 closure date as mentioned in the "note </p><p>verbale" deviates from that stated in article VIII of the </p><p>General Arrangement concerning storage in the Netherlands by </p><p>US Forces with regard to the notification period in case of a </p><p>closure.  In accordance with this agreement, a 12-month </p><p>notification period should be observed. </p><p> </p><p>If the APS sites at Brunssum and Vriezenveen will be closed, </p><p>the Wainwright-Volkers agreement will be applicable. </p><p> </p><p>In view of the projected personnel reductions in the </p><p>Netherlands Ministry of Defense as well as the present labor </p><p>market situation, job opportunities for employees who will </p><p>become excess as a result of the closure of the APS sites </p><p>will be very limited and consequently lead to high </p><p>termination costs. </p><p> </p><p>Although it may be expected that the APS activities at </p><p>Brunssum and Vriezenveen will be discontinued in the long </p><p>term, you are requested to include the possibility of keeping </p><p>the sites operational for a few years in your decision making </p><p>process in connection with rebuilding the APS site at </p><p>Livorno, Italy and the sites to be built in Eastern Europe. </p><p>Furthermore I have been informed that both sites are already </p><p>included in the planning for 2004. </p><p> </p><p>We have learned from CEGE sources that operational </p><p>maintenance of materiel returning from the Balkan area and </p><p>Iraq will produce a workload for the Brunssum and Vriezenveen </p><p>sites in 2004 and possibly in the years thereafter.  Also, </p><p>work that is presently contracted to commercial companies </p><p>could provide work.  It is noted that these tasks could be </p><p>performed by the APS sites at a much lower cost.  You are </p><p>requested to include these terms in your considerations as </p><p>well. </p><p> </p><p>It is important to end the uncertainity for the employees and </p><p>to provide clarity if and when subject sites will be closed, </p><p>soon.  Also, possible alternative duties as well as the </p><p>duration of this workload should be looked at and made known. </p><p> We prefer a transition period of three years, in which a </p><p>decision with regard to the future should be made after two </p><p>years.  During this period the regular workforce could be </p><p>decreased while necessary maintenance capacity could be kept </p><p>on standard with temporary employees.  With regard to the </p><p>reduction in force of actual redundant employees additional </p><p>measures in relation to the Wainwright-Volkers agreement </p><p>should be considered. </p><p> </p><p>If work of a temporary nature (temporary APS, operational </p><p>maintenance, or any other work of temporary nature) would </p><p>only become available for either one of subject sites, we </p><p>prefer to keep the Vriezenveen site open as the job </p><p>opportunities for the Brunssum workforce are better.  The </p><p>AFNORTH organization has shown an interest in utilizing the </p><p>Brunssum site, including a part of the workforce.  Besides, </p><p>the projected expansion of the Eygelshoven APS would create </p><p>job opportunities for excess employees of the Brunssum site. </p><p> </p><p>Signed A. van der List Major General, Director for Personnel </p><p>and Organisation Royal Netherlands Army.
