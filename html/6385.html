<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L OTTAWA 000708 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/14/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PREL, CA, UNHRC-1 </p><p>SUBJECT: CANADA\'S PRIORITIES: 59TH COMMISSION ON HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 64728 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Acting Political Counselor Mary Witt for reasons 1.5(b) </p><p>and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C)  Embassy delivered the talking points contained reftel </p><p>to Adrian Norfolk, Deputy Director for Human Rights in </p><p>DFAIT\'s Human Rights, Humanitarian Affairs and International </p><p>Women\'s Equality Division, on March 12.  Norfolk stated that </p><p>Canada\'s overall objective for CHR-59 is restoration of CHR\'s </p><p>credibility through the improvement of its efficiency and </p><p>effectiveness. Canada will pursue this objective by </p><p>encouraging member states to reduce the number of voted </p><p>resolutions, reduce the total number of resolutions </p><p>(including through biennialisation), and review the </p><p>effectiveness/marginal value of various mechanisms. In sum, </p><p>Canada wants CHR to return to decision by consensus to the </p><p>maximum extent possible, Norfolk said. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  With respect to Canada\'s support for the specific </p><p>resolutions set out reftel, Norfolk responded as follows: </p><p> </p><p>Cuba:  Canada will co-sponsor a resolution on human rights in </p><p>Cuba, provided that the resolution is balanced. </p><p> </p><p>Iraq:  Canada will support a resolution on Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>Middle East:  Canada will consider supporting Middle East </p><p>resolutions only if they are balanced; it will not support </p><p>unbalanced resolutions. </p><p> </p><p>North Korea:  Canada will support a resolution if one is </p><p>introduced. </p><p> </p><p>Zimbabwe:  Canada will support a resolution.  Canada believes </p><p>that the inability of the CHR to consider the situation in </p><p>Zimbabwe was another serious blow to the Commission\'s </p><p>credibility. </p><p> </p><p>Chechnya:  Canada will support a resolution, or chairman\'s </p><p>statement. </p><p> </p><p>Belarus:  Canada will co-sponsor a resolution if satisfied </p><p>with the draft text. </p><p> </p><p>Iran:  Canada will support a resolution if the EU runs one. </p><p>Note: I asked Norfolk if Canada is considering introducing an </p><p>Iran resolution if the EU does not.  Norfolk said there have </p><p>been discussions about this within DFAIT, that MFA Bill </p><p>Graham has a lot of interest in the situation in Iran, and </p><p>that a Canada resolution is a possibility. End note. </p><p> </p><p>Turkmenistan:  Canada will co-sponsor. </p><p> </p><p>Sudan:  Canada will support a resolution on Sudan. </p><p> </p><p>China:  No commitment of support was given for a resolution </p><p>on China, but if the U.S. offers one Canada will strongly </p><p>oppose a no-action motion. </p><p> </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
