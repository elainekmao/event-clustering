<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 003057 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA, EUR/SE, AND PMAT; OSD FOR ISA AND ISP </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/19/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PARM, PTER, PGOV, MARR, MASS, MOPS, AF, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: AFGHANISTAN: TURKS INTERESTED IN CONTRIBUTING TO </p><p>PROVINCIAL RECONSTRUCTION TEAMS; REQUEST FURTHER DETAILS </p><p>BEFORE PROVIDING OFFICIAL OFFER </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 106694 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Acting Deputy Chief of Mission Scot </p><p>Marciel.  Reasons:  1.5 (B and D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) This is an action request.  See para 4. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) MFA Coordinator for Iraq and Afghanistan </p><p>Reconstruction Ambassador Ahmet Okcun and DDG for South Asian </p><p>Affairs Aydin Evirgen told us May 9 the MFA was interested in </p><p>continuing Turkey\'s high-level participation in international </p><p>security and reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan.  Okcun </p><p>said the MFA wanted to contribute to Provincial </p><p>Reconstruction Teams (PRT) in Afghanistan, including possibly </p><p>leading one team.  Okcun said in addition to the information </p><p>provided by the USG (reftel), the MFA had received a readout </p><p>from the Turkish Embassy in Kabul of an April 23 meeting </p><p>between EUR/ACE Ambassador Taylor and selected reps of local </p><p>embassies on PRTs.  Okcun said the MFA also had received a </p><p>paper that detailed the lessons learned from the setting up </p><p>of the first PRT in Afghanistan. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Okcun said the GOT required additional information on </p><p>PRTs before providing an official offer.  He added the </p><p>answers to these questions would in part determine the size, </p><p>composition and duration of a Turkish contribution. </p><p>Furthermore, the answers might also help strengthen the hands </p><p>of those within the GOT who want Turkey to continue to play a </p><p>prominent role in reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan. </p><p>Okcun said once the MFA received the addition information, it </p><p>would circulate to the Turkish General Staff and other </p><p>agencies a paper outlining possible Turkish contributions and </p><p>seek a consensus position to provide to the US. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>ACTION REQUEST </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Embassy requests the Department provide responses to </p><p>questions raised by the MFA in para 5. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>QUESTIONS </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Below are the questions raised by Ambassador Okcun: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Are countries required to offer sufficient personnel to </p><p>staff an entire PRT (e.g. 50-60 persons), or can they offer a </p><p>more limited number? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Has the US and/or the Afghan government identified specific </p><p>types of personnel that are needed for each team?  If so, </p><p>what type of individuals/skills are needed? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Are countries free to offer personnel for specific regions? </p><p> (Note:  Okcun said that for practical reasons -- including </p><p>language and religion -- he would be interested in </p><p>contributing personnel to "Turkish-speaking regions in </p><p>Afghanistan."  He mentioned the presence of the Turkish </p><p>Consulate in Mazar-e-Sharif and the twice monthly Turkish </p><p>military flights there as examples of practical reasons for </p><p>deploying Turkish personnel to the north.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--What will be the status (e.g. diplomatic) of foreign </p><p>countries\' personnel in Afghanistan?  What if any immunities </p><p>will they enjoy? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--If the Turks are interested in leading a PRT, does the USG, </p><p>based on its experience, have a recommended breakdown of </p><p>personnel (e.g. civilian vs. military)?  (Note:  Okcun said </p><p>the Turks were looking to the US for advice to avoid having </p><p>to "reinvent the wheel."  End note.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Who will fund the costs of the PRTs?  Will each country be </p><p>responsible for financing the costs of deploying its </p><p>personnel and sustaining them in country?  (Note:  Okcun said </p><p>while he assumed each country would be responsible for costs </p><p>associated with deployment/re-deployment of personnel and </p><p>sustainment on the ground, he was less clear about such </p><p>issues as communications, ground transportation and housing. </p><p>End note.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Does the USG, based on its experience, have an idea of the </p><p>cost/month of running a PRT? </p><p>--If Turkey were to decide to finance a contribution out of </p><p>the GOT\'s pledge for Afghan reconstruction, would Turkey </p><p>"still get credit" for its pledge? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--What are the specific duties of the PRTs? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--What is the relationship between the PRTs and the US </p><p>military in Afghanistan?  Between the PRTs and the Afghan </p><p>government?  Whom will the individual PRTs work for and to </p><p>whom will they report? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Are PRTs responsible for financing and implementing </p><p>projects, or simply supporting the projects funded by other </p><p>organizations?  If the PRTs are expected to identify, fund </p><p>and implement their own projects, what will be the sources of </p><p>funding? </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
