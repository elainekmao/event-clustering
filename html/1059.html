<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ATHENS 001937 </p><p> </p><p>FOR EUR/SE;S/CT </p><p> </p><p>E.O.  12958:  DECL:  04/20/10 </p><p>TAGS:  PTER, GR </p><p>SUBJECT:  PRESS SUPPLEMENT ON THE 25-YEAR HISTORY OF 17 NOVEMBER </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR R. NICHOLAS BURNS; REASON 1.5 (B,D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) THE ATHENS DAILY, "ELEFTHEROTYPIA," PUBLISHED A DETAILED </p><p>23-PAGE SUPPLEMENT TO ITS APRIL 15 EDITION, ENTITLED "25 YEARS OF </p><p>17N."  AT FIRST BLUSH, THE SUPPLEMENT SEEMED TO BE A TYPE OF </p><p>EXPOSE ON 17 NOVEMBER.  ON CLOSER READING, THE COVERAGE\'S MESSAGE </p><p>IS NOT HARD-HITTING.  INDEED, THE SUPPLEMENT MAKES A CASE FOR A </p><p>KIND OF ARMISTICE BETWEEN THE AUTHORITIES AND 17 NOVEMBER AND AN </p><p>INFORMAL AMNESTY FOR THOSE WHO COMMITTED TERRORIST CRIMES. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) THE SUPPLEMENT CAN BE DIVIDED INTO ROUGHLY TWO PARTS. </p><p>THE FIRST PRESENTS A FACTUAL HISTORY OF 17 NOVEMBER\'S TERRORIST </p><p>ACTIVITIES BEGINNING WITH THE ASSASSINATION OF RICHARD WELCH IN </p><p>DECEMBER 1975, COMPLETE WITH A DETAILED AND NEARLY COMPREHENSIVE </p><p>CHRONOLOGY AND A MAP OF MAJOR 17 NOVEMBER ATTACKS IN GREATER </p><p>ATHENS.  THE ARTICLES AND INTERVIEWS IN THE FIRST PART CONTAIN </p><p>ALMOST NO NEW INFORMATION AND PRESENT LONG-STANDING, WELL-KNOWN </p><p>VIEWS.  COLOR PHOTOGRAPHS, SOME OF WHICH HAVE NEVER BEEN </p><p>PUBLICIZED BEFORE (AND COULD ONLY HAVE COME FROM POLICE FILES), </p><p>ALSO APPEAR.  AMONG THE CONTRIBUTORS TO THIS PART OF THE </p><p>SUPPLEMENT ARE: </p><p> </p><p>     -- PROSECUTOR IOANNIS DIOTIS, WHO ARGUES THAT THE </p><p>COUNTERTERRORIST LAWS NOW IN THE BOOKS ARE SUFFICIENT FOR </p><p>PURSUING 17 NOVEMBER AND SIMILAR ORGANIZATIONS.  THE WEAKNESS, HE </p><p>SAYS, IS THE JURY SYSTEM, WHICH OFFERS OPPORTUNITIES FOR BRIBERY </p><p>AND THREATS.  DIOTIS SAYS JURIES ARE NOT APPROPRIATE FOR </p><p>TERRORIST CASES. </p><p> </p><p>     -- LAW PROFESSOR NIKOS PARASKEVOPOULOS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF </p><p>THESSALONIKI, WHO DISCUSSES THE HISTORY OF COUNTERTERRORIST PENAL </p><p>LEGISLATION. </p><p> </p><p>     -- NEW DEMOCRACY DEPUTY DORA BAKOGIANNI (INTERVIEW), WHOSE </p><p>HUSBAND, PAVLOS BAKOGIANNIS, AN ND MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT, WAS </p><p>GUNNED DOWN BY 17 NOVEMBER IN 1989.  AMONG OTHER THINGS, SHE SAYS </p><p>THAT PASOK\'S REPEAL OF THE COUNTERTERRORIST LAWS PASSED BY THE </p><p>MITSOTAKIS WAS A MISTAKE THAT HAD NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES.  SHE </p><p>BELIEVES THAT JURIES SHOULD NOT BE A PART OF TERRORIST TRIALS. </p><p> </p><p>     -- FORMER PASOK PUBLIC ORDER MINISTER STELIOS PAPATHEMELIS </p><p>(INTERVIEW), WHO SUGGESTS THAT 17 NOVEMBER HAS BECOME A KIND OF </p><p>EXECUTIVE ORGANIZATION THAT DIRECTS OTHERS AND PROBABLY NO LONGER </p><p>REPRESENTS ITS PAST FANATICAL LEFTIST VIEWS EVEN THOUGH IT MAY </p><p>CONTINUE TO USE THE RADICAL VOCABULARY OF AN EARLIER ERA. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  THE SECOND PART OF THE SUPPLEMENT, COMPRISING AN </p><p>INTERVIEW, TWO ESSAYS, AND AN UNSIGNED ARTICLE IS DEVOTED TO HOW </p><p>TO APPROACH THE 17 NOVEMBER QUESTION, EFFECTIVELY PROMOTING AN </p><p>INFORMAL AMNESTY. </p><p> </p><p>     -- IN AN INTERVIEW, YIANNIS PANOUSIS, IDENTIFIED AS A </p><p>PROFESSOR OF CRIMINOLOGY, ARGUES THAT THE TIME HAS COME FOR THE </p><p>GREEK GOVERNMENT TO ARRIVE AT A "POLITICAL" SOLUTION TO THE 17 </p><p>NOVEMBER ISSUE.  THE GOVERNMENT, HE SAYS, SHOULD CONSIDER </p><p>"REHABILITATION" OF 17 NOVEMBER MEMBERS, ADDING THAT THE GREEK </p><p>PEOPLE "HAVE FORGIVEN GERMANS, TURKS, AND THE JUNTA."  THE </p><p>INTERVIEW IS ENTITLED, "A VARKIZA IS NEEDED FOR TERRORISM," </p><p>REFERRING TO THE TOWN SOUTH OF ATHENS WHERE THE COMMUNIST-LED </p><p>RESISTANCE AND THE BRITISH-BACKED ROYAL GOVERNMENT SIGNED AN </p><p>ARMISTICE IN 1945 AFTER INITIAL FIGHTING, FOLLOWING THE WITHDRAWAL </p><p>OF GERMAN OCCUPATION FORCES. </p><p> </p><p>     -- IN HER ESSAY, "POLITICAL VIOLENCE:  A GREEK UNIQUENESS," </p><p>MARY BOSSI, A FORMER HIGH-LEVEL PUBLIC ORDER MINISTRY OFFICIAL </p><p>RESPONSIBLE FOR COUNTERTERRORISM UNDER THEN PRIME MINISTER </p><p>MITSOTAKIS, REPEATS HER WELL-KNOWN VIEWS.  SHE IS CRITICAL OF </p><p>WHAT SHE CALLS THE "APOLOGETIC" POSTURE OF GREEK GOVERNMENTS VIS- </p><p>A-VIS THE U.S. ON ITS EFFORTS TO CAPTURE THE TERRORISTS. </p><p>SUGGESTING AN AMNESTY, BOSSI SAYS THAT THE "HONORABLE RETIREMENT" </p><p>OF THE 17 NOVEMBER QUESTION WOULD BE A KIND OF A SOLUTION. </p><p> </p><p>     -- SOPHIA VIDALI, A LECTURER AT THE SOCIAL ADMINISTRATION </p><p>FACULTY OF THE DEMOCRITUS UNIVERSITY OF THRACE, STATES IN HER </p><p>ESSAY, "TIME TO FACE POLITICAL MEASURES," THAT THE MAIN VIOLENT </p><p>THREAT CONFRONTING GREECE TODAY IS MAINSTREAM CRIME RATHER </p><p>POLITICALLY MOTIVATED TERRORISM.  SHE SAYS THAT TERRORISM IS NOW </p><p>A QUESTION ONLY OF FOREIGN RELATIONS.  TERRORISM, SHE CONTINUES, </p><p>SHOULD BE DEALT WITH ON "POLITICAL TERMS."  WHILE THE VICTIMS OF </p><p>TERRORISM SHOULD NOT BE FORGOTTEN, SHE ARGUES THAT A "DEMOCRATIC </p><p>POLITICAL SYSTEM CANNOT FUNCTION ON THE BASIS OF RETRIBUTION." </p><p> </p><p>     -- AN UNSIGNED ARTICLE STATES THAT, ACCORDING TO A REPORT BY </p><p>PROSECUTION OFFICIALS, 17 NOVEMBER\'S TERRORIST ACTIVITIES HAVE </p><p>DECREASED AND ARE LIKELY TO FALL TO ZERO IN THE FUTURE. </p><p>NEVERTHELESS, THE REPORT NOTES THAT 17 NOVEMBER COULD BECOME </p><p>ACTIVE AGAIN AND WOULD THEN HAVE TO BE CONSIDERED THE NUMBER ONE </p><p>TERRORIST THREAT FOR GREECE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) COMMENT:  THE IDEA OF A "POLITICAL SETTLEMENT" OF THE </p><p>TERRORIST QUESTION IN GREECE, HOWEVER UNWELCOME, IS NOT </p><p>ALTOGETHER NEW.  DEVOTING AN ENTIRE SUPPLEMENT TO THE ISSUE IS A </p><p>DEPARTURE IN PRESS PRACTICE, HOWEVER.  IN THE PAST, </p><p>"ELEFTHEROTYPIA," WITH THE SECOND LARGEST CIRCULATION OF ALL </p><p>GREEK NEWSPAPERS, HAS SERVED AS A MOUTHPIECE FOR LEFT-WING CAUSES </p><p>AND HAS PUBLISHED PROCLAMATIONS OF 17 NOVEMBER.  THE TONE OF THE </p><p>SUPPLEMENT IS THEREFORE NOT SURPRISING.  WE WILL NEED TO BLUNT </p><p>THIS LINE OF ARGUMENTATION WHEN WE LAUNCH OUR REWARDS PROGRAM IN </p><p>THE COMING MONTH.  LEST THERE BE VOICES IN THE SIMITIS </p><p>ADMINISTRATION PUSHING FOR A "POLITICAL" SOLUTION," WE WILL ALSO </p><p>NEED TO MAKE ABSOLUTELY CLEAR TO THE GREEK GOVERNMENT THAT THIS </p><p>IS NOT THE KIND OF RESOLUTION OF THE TERRORIST PROBLEM THAT WE </p><p>HAVE IN MIND.  INTERESTINGLY, THE SUPPLEMENT HAS GONE VIRTUALLY </p><p>UNNOTICED AND UNREMARKED IN THE GREEK POLITICAL SCENE.  THAT, BY </p><p>ITSELF, DEMONSTRATES THE UPHILL TASK WE FACE IN GALVANIZING </p><p>PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR GREEK GOVERNMENT IMPLEMENTATION OF A ZERO- </p><p>TOLERANCE POLICY ON TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>BURNS </p><p></p></div>
