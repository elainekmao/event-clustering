<p>UNCLAS HANOI 000289 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/RSP AND EAP/BCLTV </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, IZ, VM </p><p>SUBJECT:  Vietnamese media critical on Iraq </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A.  Hanoi 0261       B. State 33974 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  Senior GVN and Communist Party leaders have </p><p>maintained a public silence in response to Secretary </p><p>Powell\'s UNSC presentation.  Answering written questions </p><p>from foreign journalists on February 6, the MFA spokeswoman </p><p>said that "now it is important to prevent wars" and </p><p>reiterated Vietnam\'s wish "to see the Iraq issue be resolved </p><p>peacefully."  She also expressed Vietnam\'s view that the UN </p><p>inspection team "needs more time to thoroughly and carefully </p><p>study all available information."  Major media outlets </p><p>carried her remarks on February 7. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  TV and major newspaper coverage relied heavily on </p><p>international media reports focusing on critical reaction to </p><p>the Secretary\'s presentation and highlighting the views of </p><p>Russian, French, and German Foreign Ministers.  Television </p><p>news on February 6 showed large public protests in Bangkok </p><p>and Baghdad.  Newspaper reports on February 7 included </p><p>headlines such as "General public skeptical about report </p><p>presented by U.S. Secretary of State," "U.S. unable to </p><p>convince the world," "U.S. evidence against Iraq not </p><p>convincing," and "Powell war plea finds few takers."  A </p><p>signed commentary by the international editor of the </p><p>"People\'s Army" daily (Quan Doi Nhan Dan) claimed that the </p><p>Secretary\'s presentation was to "create pretexts for waging </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>a war against Iraq" and that UN inspectors had acknowledge </p><p>"positive cooperation from Iraq."  The commentary concluded </p><p>that "we vehemently condemn the abuse of fighting terrorism </p><p>to interfere or wage a war against an independent and </p><p>sovereign state." </p><p>PORTER </p><p></p></div>
