<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 RANGOON 000030 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV, EB </p><p>COMMERCE FOR ITA JEAN KELLY </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA JEFF NEIL </p><p>CINCPAC FOR FPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, ECON, BM, Economy </p><p>SUBJECT: DANGERS LURK WITHIN BURMA\'S SHADOW BANKS </p><p> </p><p>REF: 02 RANGOON 1557 </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary:  The surprisingly large informal banking </p><p>sector in Burma has become a major cause of inflation, and a </p><p>threat to the stability of the already weakened Burmese </p><p>economy.  A crackdown combined with a general liberalization </p><p>of the official banking sector would be the best course for </p><p>the GOB and Burma\'s economy.  Unfortunately, given the </p><p>regime\'s economic track record, that is probably the least </p><p>likely scenario of all.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>Gold Bars and Monks\' Robes </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) There is evidence that the regime is pondering </p><p>clamping down on Burma\'s legally murky, but nonetheless </p><p>booming, informal finance sector.  This past Fall, </p><p>authorities gave the order to shut down two of the roughly 20 </p><p>extant non-bank financial institutions on charges that the </p><p>firms\' management was involved in embezzlement and egregious </p><p>corruption.  (One was caught at the airport trying to flee </p><p>with a suitcase stuffed with dollars, the other was arrested </p><p>for secretly casting gold bars.)  The government has ordered </p><p>the two companies to repay all depositors, but this seems </p><p>unlikely in the short run.  The larger of the two outfits has </p><p>said nothing will be forthcoming before May.  Even if </p><p>repayments do eventually occur, they will likely be pyas on </p><p>the kyat. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) The informal banking sector in Burma found its niche </p><p>due to the ineffectual and overregulated private banking </p><p>sector and the average Burmese person\'s mistrust of banks </p><p>under government scrutiny.  Taking advantage of loopholes in </p><p>the law, nascent entrepreneurs (and con men) began to take </p><p>deposits or investments and to establish non-bank finance </p><p>companies under the Cooperatives Law or the Myanmar Company </p><p>Act.  The attraction was the lack of regulation.  Neither </p><p>cooperatives nor companies, are supervised by the Ministry of </p><p>Finance and Central Bank or subject to normal banking </p><p>regulations.  Hence, for these institutions at least, there </p><p>were no reserve or liquidity requirements, nor any </p><p>restriction on lending or borrowing rates. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Some of these institutions outright offer interest </p><p>rates 5 or 6 times the legal deposit rate (e.g., as high as </p><p>50 or 60 percent per annum); others offer the same </p><p>enticement, but insist that depositors are buying "shares" in </p><p>the institution (and its underlying real estate and other </p><p>commercial investments) that happen to pay out a 60 percent </p><p>rate of return.  However, despite the rhetoric, none of these </p><p>venture capital outfits are public firms, and none are </p><p>scrutinized by the government or a board of directors. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) These institutions generally take the money that is </p><p>deposited and immediately invest it, usually in some private </p><p>venture benefiting the banks\' ownership.  Often the funds go </p><p>into rapidly appreciating assets, such as real estate, </p><p>automobiles, gold, and gems.  However, much investment has </p><p>also found its way into the industrial sector, funding </p><p>ventures in everything from seafood exporting to the </p><p>production of monks\' robes.  The danger to consumers is that </p><p>very few of these banks actually keep cash on hand.  As a </p><p>result, whenever the underlying investments go bad, there is </p><p>a risk that either the institutions will go bust or that </p><p>promised interest rates or returns on investment will funded </p><p>by new deposits -- a classic pyramid scheme. </p><p> </p><p>A Hidden Giant </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Because of total absence of data, financial experts </p><p>here are reluctant to estimate the number of depositors or </p><p>the value of deposits now lodged with these unofficial </p><p>financial institutions.  However, they agree that the sector </p><p>is booming and that both are likely quite high.  One private </p><p>banker said he would not be surprised if "non-bank financial </p><p>institutions" had as much as 250 billion kyat (about half </p><p>what is held in the official banking sector) sloshing through </p><p>them.  These same experts said these institutions might have </p><p>between 100,000 and 200,000 depositors -- including small </p><p>savers, business people, and military officers. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) Even if the deposits are only half this estimate, </p><p>they represent a massive amount of unsupervised, "illegal" </p><p>funds that could well be a major source of the excess money </p><p>supply and speculative investment that are driving up </p><p>inflation here.  Last year, consumer price inflation in the </p><p>Rangoon area was about 60 percent, with prices of assets such </p><p>as real estate and automobiles rising even higher.  The fact </p><p>that thousands of depositors, many of them quite small time, </p><p>have their money in these schemes also raises the specter of </p><p>serious political and economic turmoil should these </p><p>institutions suddenly collapse. </p><p> </p><p>Government Crackdown: Stop or We\'ll Say Stop Again </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) The informal banking sector is basically a time bomb </p><p>waiting to go off.  Left alone, it will inevitably crash, </p><p>potentially bringing down asset markets with them. </p><p>Consequently, there is no question but that the government </p><p>should take action against these firms simply in the interest </p><p>of stability.  However such actions have downsides.  For one, </p><p>several banking experts have told us that high-level military </p><p>officials are shareholders or major depositors in these </p><p>institutions.  Second, at this sensitive time, the GOB won\'t </p><p>likely risk the political discontent that could come from </p><p>essentially ruining thousands of small depositors who have </p><p>deposited billions of kyats in these institutions.  Third, </p><p>too-rapid government seizure and auctioning of these </p><p>companies\' assets (to repay depositors) could also place </p><p>significant deflationary pressures on asset prices.  This </p><p>could then undermine the portfolios of legitimate banks and </p><p>cause a serious banking crisis (see reftel). </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) Despite the risks, it is in the GOB\'s best interest </p><p>to shut down this dangerous network.  If it does, the </p><p>question is whether it will do so intelligently, by </p><p>instituting real banking reform alongside a slow but steady </p><p>crackdown on these shadow banks, or not.  If legitimate </p><p>private banks could set their own deposit and lending rates, </p><p>under the supervision of the Central Bank and the Ministry of </p><p>Finance, they could attract many small depositors who are now </p><p>forced to look to the black market for some real return that </p><p>competes with inflation.  Funds would move from relatively </p><p>high-risk to relatively low-risk institutions, banks would </p><p>get the funding and liquidity they now badly need, and asset </p><p>market prices would remain basically stable.  That sort of </p><p>intelligent liberalization, however, is probably the least </p><p>likely scenario.  If the past is prologue, the GOB will </p><p>either let the current bubble build, while doing nothing, or </p><p>crack down hard with no accompanying banking reforms.  In </p><p>either case, the economy (and Burma\'s small depositors) will </p><p>pay the price, either now or later.  End comment. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
