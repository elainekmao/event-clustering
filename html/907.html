<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 NIAMEY 005135 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR MORAN; LONDON FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/03/07 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, EAID, SOCI, NG, IR, KISL </p><p>SUBJECT:  ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALISM, IRAN, AND NIGER </p><p> </p><p>REF: NIAMEY 3264 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR CHARLES O. CECIL. REASON: </p><p>1.5(D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  MOST NIGERIENS BELIEVE ISLAMIC </p><p>FUNDAMENTALISM CONSTITUTES A LONG-TERM THREAT TO THE </p><p>SECULAR STATE ESTABLISHED UNDER NIGER\'S CONSTITUTION. </p><p>IRAN IS WORKING QUIETLY AND WITH SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES </p><p>TO PROMOTE SHI\'ISM IN NIGER.  SHIA RELIGIOUS LEADERS IN </p><p>NORTHERN NIGERIA ARE ALSO A FORCE FOR CONSERVATISM IN </p><p>THE MARADI AREA OF NIGER.  GON OFFICIALS ARE SUSPICIOUS </p><p>OF IRAN, BUT FOR THE MOMENT TOLERATE ITS PRESENCE AND </p><p>ITS ACTIVITIES, PROBABLY IN THE HOPE OF RECEIVING </p><p>ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE FROM THE IRANIAN GOVERNMENT IN THE </p><p>FUTURE.  SIMULTANEOUSLY, THE GON IS DETERMINED TO TAKE </p><p>STRONG ACTIONS AGAINST THE EXPRESSION OF FUNDAMENTALIST, </p><p>SHIA DOCTRINES WITH THE AIM OF MINIMIZING NIGERIAN </p><p>INFLUENCE IN NIGERIEN RELIGIOUS CIRCLES.  POVERTY AND </p><p>DESPAIR MAY BE A GREATER SOURCE OF CONSERVATIVE AND </p><p>FUNDAMENTALIST TENDENCIES IN NIGER THAN EITHER OF THESE </p><p>TWO OUTSIDE INFLUENCES, BUT TNE OUTSIDE INFLUENCES CAN </p><p>REINFORCE SOCIAL AND RELIGIOUS TRENDS ALREADY UNDER WAY. </p><p>REDUCING NIGER\'S POVERTY IS LIKELY TO BE THE MOST </p><p>PRODUCTIVE WAY TO HALT THE SPREAD OF FUNDAMENTALIST </p><p>IDEAS IN NIGER.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>IS ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALISM A THREAT TO NIGER? </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) "EXTREME POVERTY IS A GREATER CAUSE OF ISLAMIC </p><p>FUNDAMENTALISM THAN IRANIAN EFFORTS," SAID FORMER PRIME </p><p>MINISTER HAMA AMADOU TO AMBASSADOR CECIL OVER LUNCH ON </p><p>OCTOBER 23.  "WHETHER FUNDAMENTALISM GROWS OR NOT WILL </p><p>DEPEND ON WHETHER THE GOVERNMENT MAKES PROGRESS IN </p><p>COMBATTING POVERTY," ADDED AMADOU.  IN NIGER\'S CURRENT </p><p>POSITION (NUMBER 173 OUT OF 175 COUNTRIES) ON THE UNDP\'S </p><p>1997 REPORT ON HUMAN DEVELOPMENT, ONE WOULD HAVE TO </p><p>CONCLUDE THAT NIGER IS ONE OF THE MOST FERTILE GROUNDS </p><p>ONE COULD FIND FOR FUNDAMENTALISM TO TAKE ROOT. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) GON OFFICIALS TAKE THE THREAT OF FUNDAMENTALISM </p><p>SERIOUSLY; A NUMBER OF OFFICIALS HAVE EXPRESSED THEIR </p><p>DETERMINATION THAT IT NOT SPREAD.  MARADI AND ITS </p><p>NEIGHBOR GUIDAN-ROUMDJI ARE CONSIDERED TO BE THE CENTER </p><p>OF FUNDAMENTALIST TENDENCIES IN NIGER; SOME MUSLIMS IN </p><p>THAT AREA CONSIDER TNEMSELVES SHI\'ITES.  ACCORDING TO </p><p>THE FORMER PREFET OF MARADI, LTC MALLAM OUBANDAWAKI, </p><p>FUNDAMENTALIST MOVEMENTS IN NIGER DATE FROM THE 1980S. </p><p>(OBVIOUSLY THE COLONEL WAS THINKING IN MODERN TERMS OF </p><p>REFERENCE.  MANY HISTORIANS QE THE REFORM MOVEMENT LED </p><p>BY OUSMANE DAN FODIO IN NORTHERN NIGERIA AROUND 1800 AS </p><p>A FUNDAMENTALIST MOVEMENT, THAT IS, A RETURN TO THE </p><p>LITERAL INTERPRETATION OF THE KORAN AND ITS STRICT </p><p>APPLICATION TO DAILY LIFE.)  IN THE 1990S THESE EARLIER </p><p>FUNDAMENTALIST TENDENCIES HAVE BECOME MORE VIGOROUS, </p><p>SAID THE COLONEL, PARTLY BECAUSE OF THE WAVE OF </p><p>DEMOCRATIZATION SWEEPING THE AFRICAN CONTINENT. </p><p>OUBANDAWAKI CONSIDERS THE ORIGIN OF THESE FUNDAMENTALIST </p><p>TENDENCIES TO BE NORTHERN NIGERIA, WHERE CERTAIN </p><p>RELIGIOUS LEADERS ARE DIRECTING A CONSCIOUS CAMPAIGN TO </p><p>SPREAD THEIR VERSION OF ISLAM INTO NIGER.  THE OBJECTIVE </p><p>OF THE FUNDAMENTALISTS, IN THE COLONEL\'S VIEW, IS TO </p><p>ESTABLISH AN ISLAMIC STATE IN WHICN SHARIA LAW IS THE </p><p>LAW OF THE LAND. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) MINISTER OF INTERIOR IDI ANGO OMAR, IN JANUARY, </p><p>TRACED THE RISE OF FUNDAMENTALISM IN NIGER BACK TO 1989. </p><p>PUTTING HIS OWN SPECIAL TWIST ON IT, HE ACCUSED THE </p><p>FUNDAMENTALISTS OF BEING INCLINED TO USE VIOLENCE TO </p><p>SPREAD THEIR VIEWS, AND ACCUSED THEM OF WORKING IN </p><p>CONCERT WITH THE OPPOSITION TO PRESIDENT BARE, WHICH WAS </p><p>AT THE TIME PREPARING A SERIES OF PUBLIC DEMONSTRATIONS </p><p>TO MARK THE FIRST ANNIVERSARY OF THE BARE COUP. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) FORMER GENDARMERIE COMMAWDER GENERAL YOUSOUFA </p><p>MAIGA, NOW AMBASSADOR TO ALGERIA, EXPRESSED TO THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR HIS OWN CONCERN OVER FUWDAMENTALISM, CITING </p><p>IRANIAN ADVERTISEMENTS AND ACTIVITIES, PLUS AN EID AL- </p><p>FITR CLASH BETWEEN SHI\'ITES AND SECURITY FORCES IN THE </p><p>MARADI AREA LAST FEBRUARY.  MAIGA VOWED THAT THE GON </p><p>WOULD NOT LET FUNDAMENTALISM GET OUT OF CONTROL.  IN THE </p><p>INCIDENT REFERRED TO, SHIA MUSLIMS HAD WANTED TO </p><p>CELEBRATE THE EID AL-FITR A DAY LATER THAN THE OFFICIAL </p><p>DAY OBSERVED BY NIGER\'S SUNNI MAJORITY, BUT SECURITY </p><p>FORCES STOPPED THE OBSERVANCE.  THE AMBASSADOR ASKED </p><p>NIGER\'S FORMER DCM FROM ITS WASHINGTON EMBASSY WHY THIS </p><p>POINT SHOULD BE IMPORTANT TO GON AUTHORITIES.  HE GAVE </p><p>TWO REASONS.  FIRST, ISLAM IS A COMMUNAL RELIGION; THE </p><p>COMMUNITY IS SUPPOSED TO DO IT TOGETHER.  "IF 900 PEOPLE </p><p>WANT TO CELEBRATE A FESTIVAL ON A CERTAIN DAY, YOU CAN\'T </p><p>HAVE 100 OTHERS DOING IT SOME OTHER TIME.  IT ISN\'T </p><p>RIGHT," HE SAID.  SECONDLY, THE GOVERNMENT WISHES TO </p><p>MINIMIZE NIGERIAN INFLUENCE BECAUSE NIGERIANS ARE MORE </p><p>PRONE TO VIOLENCE THAN ARE NIGERIENS.  NIGERIA\'S ISLAMIC </p><p>CALENDAR HAS OFTEN PUT IT ONE DAY OFF THE CALENDAR </p><p>OBSERVED IN NIGER, SAID THE DCM; IT\'S A SMALL POINT BUT </p><p>IT CAN\'T BE IGNORED.  ANOTHER NIGERIEN SAID THAT THE </p><p>SHIAS ARE JUST TESTING THE GOVERNMENT.  IF THEY GET AWAY </p><p>WITH ONE SMALL CHANGE, THEN THEY WILL FEEL EMBOLDENED, </p><p>AND PRESS FOR OTHERS. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>IRAN\'S ROLE </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) CERTAIN EVIDENCE OF IRAN\'S PRESENCE AND ACTIVITY </p><p>CAN BE EASILY SEEN IN NIAMEY: A SCHOOL, A HEALTH CLINIC, </p><p>AND A SMALL TRADE FAIR LAST JANUARY.  THE SCHOOL ACCEPTS </p><p>NIGERIEN CHILDREN FROM AGE FIVE THROUGH THE LATE TEENAGE </p><p>YEARS.  WHEN THE FORMER ALGERIAN AMBASSADOR EXPRESSED </p><p>CONCERN OVER THE SCHOOL TO GON OFFICIALS, HE WAS TOLD </p><p>THAT PERMISSION HAD NEVER BEEN GIVEN TO OPEN IT AND THAT </p><p>IT WOULD BE CLOSED, BUT THAT HAS NOT HAPPENED YET. </p><p>ACCORDING TO THE ALGERIAN, PATIENTS AT THE CLINIC, WHICH </p><p>OFFERS FREE CARE FOR THE NEEDIEST, ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO </p><p>SHIA INDOCTRINATION.  ONE SOUS-PREFET TOLD THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR THAT WHEN SUNNI MUSLIMS BECOME SHIAS, THE </p><p>IRANIANS REWARD THEM WITH MONEY TO BUY NEW CLOTHES "SO </p><p>THAT THEY CAN BE PROPERLY DRESSED WHEN THEY GO TO THE </p><p>MOSQUE."  IN JUNE THE FORMER SAUDI CHARGE TOLD THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR THAT THE IRANIANS WERE SPENDING A LOT OF </p><p>MONEY IN NIGER TO PROMOTE THEIR RELIGION AND THEIR </p><p>IMAGE.  HE DID NOT THINK THEY WERE ACHIEVING MUCH, BUT </p><p>ADDED THAT THEY WERE TAKING THE LONG-TERM VIEW. THE </p><p>TRADE FAIR LASTED A WEEK AND CONSISTED OF HANDICRAFTS </p><p>AND SMALL MANUFACTURED ITEMS DISPLAYED BY 24 FIRMS.  THE </p><p>EXHIBIT WAS OPENED BY THE DIRECTOR OF AFRICAN AFFAIRS IN </p><p>THE IRANIAN FOREIGN MINISTRY, IDENTIFIED AS A MR. "JENID </p><p>(ALSO "DJAWID") GHORBER OGHLI" (SIC).  THE OTHER IRANIAN </p><p>VISITOR OF NOTE DURING THE YEAR WAS THE MINISTER OF </p><p>FOREIGN AFFAIRS WHO CAME ON JULY 12 AS PART OF A </p><p>REGIONAL TRIP SOLICITING SUPPORT FOR THE HOLDING OF THE </p><p>OIC SUMMIT CONFERENCE IN TEHRAN IN DECEMBER. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) IRANIAN ACTIVITY IN NIGER IS REGARDED WITH </p><p>SUSPICION BY THE GON.  PRESIDENT BARE TOLD THE ALGERIAN. </p><p>AMBASSADOR RECENTLY THAT THE GON KNOWS WHAT IS GOING ON </p><p>IN THE IRANIAN SCHOOL AND THE CLINIC AND THAT ALL </p><p>IRANIAN ACTIVITIES "ARE CLOSELY MONITORED."  BARE TOLD </p><p>AMBASSADOR CECIL IN SEPTEMBER QUITE EMPHATICALLY THAT </p><p>NIGER (HE HAS TO MEAN THE GOVERNMENT) HAS RECEIVED NOT </p><p>ONE DOLLAR FROM IRAN.  IT IS TRUE THAT SEVENTEEN </p><p>NIGERIENS WERE GIVEN UNIVERSITY SCHOLARSHIPS FOR STUDY </p><p>IN IRAN SOMETIME IN THE LAST YEAR, BUT WHEN ONE RETURNED </p><p>TO NIGER TO REPORT THAT ALL HAD BEEN SENT TO QUM WHERE </p><p>THEY WERE GIVEN INSTRUCTIONS IN THE USE OF ARMS, THE GON </p><p>CALLED THEM ALL BACK AND THERE ARE NOW NONE THERE. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) THIS DISTRUST OF IRAN MAKES IT HARD TO </p><p>UNDERSTAND THE RATIONALE BEHIND FOREIGN MINISTER </p><p>MAYAKI\'S JUNE VISIT TO TEHRAN, AFTER WHICH IT WAS </p><p>ANNOUNCED THAT IRAN AND NIGER WOULD RAISE THEIR </p><p>RELATIONS TO THE AMBASSADORIAL LEVEL.  (IRAN IS </p><p>REPRESENTED BY A PERMANENT CHARGE IN NIAMEY; NIGER HAS . </p><p>NO REPRESENTATIVE IN TEHRAN.)  ACCORDING TO THE FORMER </p><p>ALGERIAN AMBASSADOR, IRAN OFFERED TO PAY RENT, </p><p>UTILITIES, AND TELEPHONE FOR A NIGERIEN EMBASSY IN </p><p>TEHRAN.  FORNMIN MAYAKI TOLD THE ALGERIAN THAT HE NEVER </p><p>AGREED TO ESTABLISH AN EMBASSY IN TEHRAN--MERELY TO </p><p>ELEVATE RELATIONS TO THE AMBASSADORIAL LEVEL.  NIGER\'S </p><p>CLOSEST AMBASSADORS IN THE AREA ARE IN RIYADH, KUWAIT, </p><p>AND CAIRO.  AMBASSADOR CECIL HAS ASKED NUMEROUS GON </p><p>OFFICIALS FOR THEIR VIEWS CONCERNING THE REASONS FOR </p><p>ELEVATING NIGERIEN-IRANIAN RELATIONS, BUT NONE HAVE </p><p>GIVEN ANY SUBSTANTIVE REPLY.  MFA SECGEN SEYDOU IN </p><p>OCTOBER TOLD THE AMBASSADOR NOT TO ATTACH TOO MUCH </p><p>IMPORTANCE TO THE MATTER.  WE NOTE THAT AT THE TIME OF </p><p>THE VISIT, TEHRAN SPOKE OF "IRAN\'S READINESS FOR </p><p>COOPERATION WITH NIGER IN THE FIELDS OF AGRICULTURE, </p><p>ANIMAL HUSBANDRY, DAM BUILDING, AND COMMERCE." (FBIS </p><p>LONDON 301454Z JUN 97).  WHEN SEEKING THE MOTIVATION FOR </p><p>NIGER\'S POLICIES ONE MUST ALWAYS CONSIDER THE </p><p>POSSIBILITY THAT A SEARCH FOR ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE IS THE </p><p>PRIMARY FACTOR. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>LONG TERM TRENDS </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) ALMOST ALL NIGERIENS WILL OPINE THAT </p><p>FUNDAMENTALISM IS A LONG-TERM THREAT FOR NIGER. </p><p>ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT CLOISTERING OF WOMEN IN </p><p>THE EASTERN AREAS OF THE COUNTRY, ESPECIALLY THE </p><p>ZINDER REGION, MAY BE ON THE INCREASE.  AS RECENTLY AS </p><p>OCTOBER A GROUP OF EDUCATED, PROFESSIONAL NIGERIEN WOMEN </p><p>TOLD THE AMBASSADOR AND THE PAO THAT ATTENDANCE AT </p><p>ISLAMIC SCHOOLS WAS ON THE INCREASE BECAUSE MORE AND </p><p>MORE PARENTS WANTED THEIR CHILDREN TO RECEIVE THE MORAL </p><p>VALUES PRESENTED IN THE ISLAMIC SCHOOLS\' CURRICULA. </p><p>(GOVERNMENT SCHOOLS ARE ALSO FREQUENTLY INTERRUPTED BY </p><p>TEACHERS\' STRIKES, SEEKING UNPAID WAGES.)  EDUCATED </p><p>WOMEN IN PARTICULAR REGRET THE GROWING CONSERVATIVE </p><p>RELIGIOUS INFLUENCE ON PUBLIC AFFAIRS BECAUSE EFFORTS TO </p><p>LEGISLATE A "FAMILY CODE" HAVE BEEN ON HOLD SINCE 1992 </p><p>OWING TO THE FIERCE OPPOSITION OF CONSERVATIVE, IF NOT </p><p>FUNDAMENTALIST, MUSLIMS, SOME OF WHOM THREATENED </p><p>VIOLENCE AGAINST ADVOCATES OF THE CODE.  THOUGH NIGER IS </p><p>A SECULAR STATE, WOMEN DO NOT HAVE FULL EQUALITY WITH </p><p>MEN BEFORE THE LAW IN CERTAIN AREAS, SUCN AS DIVORCE </p><p>PROCEEDINGS AND INHERITANCE CASES.  THE FAMILY CODE </p><p>WOULD HAVE ASSURED THIS EQUALITY. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) THE FRENCH AMBASSADOR TOLD AMBASSADOR CECIL </p><p>THAT HIS FRENCH STAFF IS UNANIMOUS IN BELIEVING THAT </p><p>IRAN IS WORKING COVERTLY IN NIGER TO PROMOTE SHI\'ISM. </p><p>"THEY HAVE MONEY AND ARE NOT IN A HURRY," SAID </p><p>AMBASSADOR PAVEC.  "IT IS NOT AN IMMINENT THREAT, BUT IN </p><p>TEN YEARS, WHO KNOWS?" </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) WE CONCLUDE THAT BOTH IRAN AND RELIGIOUS </p><p>LEADERS IN NORTHERN NIGERIA ARE WORKING TO PROMOTE </p><p>SHI\'ISM IN NIGER.  THIS IS LIKELY TO BE A SLOW PROCESS </p><p>BECAUSE OF THE ABSENCE, IN GENERAL, OF STRONG RELIGIOUS </p><p>BROTHERHOODS ("TURUQ", OR "CONFRERIES") IN NIGER, SUCH </p><p>AS THE TIDJANI IN SENEGAL OR THE SANOUSSI IN LIBYA. </p><p>THERE IS NO STRUCTURE THROUGH WHICH TO WORK TO INFLUENCE </p><p>THOUSANDS OF BELIEVERS AT A TIME; IT\'S A TASK WHICH HAS </p><p>TO BE ADVANCED MORE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS.  ONE NEED </p><p>NOT BE A SHIA TO BE A FUNDAMENTALIST, HOWEVER.  THE TURN </p><p>TOWARD RELIGION TO ASSUAGE FEELINGS OF DESPAIR AND </p><p>HOPELESSNESS CAN EASILY BE PROMPTED BY POVERTY.  (WE </p><p>NOTE THAT BOTH THE WORLD BANK AND THE UNDP HAVE LAUNCHED </p><p>PROGRAMS DESIGNED TO COMBAT POVERTY.  THEY ARE NOT </p><p>MOTIVATED, HOWEVER, BY A DESIRE TO RESIST ISLAMIC </p><p>FUNDAMENTALISM.)  IT MAY ONLY BE A SMALL STEP FROM SUCH </p><p>DESPAIR TO ATTACKING GOVERNMENTS, OR EVEN DONORS, WHICH </p><p>HAVE SHOWN THEMSELVES INCAPABLE OF SOLVING THE ECONOMIC </p><p>AND SOCIAL PROBLEMS AFFLICTING THE PEOPLE.  THE ANALYSIS </p><p>OF FORMER PRIME MINISTER AMADOU, IN ITS SIMPLICITY, MAY </p><p>WELL BE RIGHT ON TARGET.  BUT THE IRANIANS ARE HERE AS </p><p>WELL, WORKING TO FORCE THE PACE A BIT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CECIL </p><p></p></div>
