SUMMARY. THE 17TH SESSION OF THE UN FOOD AND </p><p>AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATION (FAO) COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE </p><p>(COAG) MET MARCH 31 - APRIL 4, 2003.  COAG PROVED ONCE </p><p>AGAIN TO BE THE MOST POLITICIZED OF FAO\'S TECHNICAL </p><p>COMMITTEES. ONLY ONE AGENDA ITEM RATED CONSENSUS </p><p>ENDORSEMENT; THE REMAINDER WERE EITHER SENT BACK FOR RE- </p><p>WRITING OR VIEWED AS TOO FLAWED TO WARRANT AN UNQUALIFIED </p><p>ENDORSEMENT.  THE AGENDA, LARGELY SET BY THE SECRETARIAT, </p><p>PITTED CAIRNS GROUP COUNTRIES (AND THE U.S.) AGAINST EU </p><p>MEMBERS ON "THE PRECAUTIONARY PRINCIPLE" (UNDER THE "THE </p><p>FOOD CHAIN" ITEM) AND "MULTIFUNCTIONALITY" (UNDER "GOOD </p><p>AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES").  NON-CAIRNS GROUP G-77 MEMBERS </p><p>SAVED THEIR FIRE FOR THE WHO/FAO REPORT ON DIET ON </p><p>NUTRITION, EXPRESSING CONCERN THAT RECOMMENDATIONS ON </p><p>SUGAR INTAKE WOULD HAVE A DELETERIOUS EFFECT ON SUGAR </p><p>PRODUCING DEVELOPING COUNTRIES AND REQUESTING THE REPORT </p><p>BE CONSIDERED AT THE NEXT COAG.  LOOKING AHEAD TO THE </p><p>NEXT BIENNIUM\'S PROGRAM OF WORK, DEVELOPED AND DEVELOPING </p><p>COUNTRIES WERE ABLE TO RALLY AROUND THE NEED TO </p><p>STRENGTHEN FUNDING FOR THE PLANT HEALTH STANDARD-SETTING </p><p>WORK OF THE INTERIM COMMISSION ON PHYTOSANITARY MEASURES </p><p>(ICPM).  U.S. AND AUSTRALIAN EFFORTS TO CURTAIL FUNDING </p><p>OF THE CONTROVERSIAL "FOOD CHAIN" PROGRAM SHOULD SEND A </p><p>SIGNAL TO THE SECRETARIAT THAT FAO SHOULD FOCUS ON BOTTOM- </p><p>UP AGRICULTURAL INITIATIVES, RATHER THAN CHURNING OUT </p><p>GLOBAL "FRAMEWORKS" AND "STRATEGIES."  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  THE 17TH SESSION OF THE FAO COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE </p><p>(COAG) MET IN ROME MARCH 31 - APRIL 4, 2003.  ONE HUNDRED </p><p>AND TWENTY FAO MEMBERS PARTICIPATED IN THE MEETING.

A SUMMARY OF THE </p><p>WHO/FAO STUDY ON DIET AND NUTRITION APPEARED AS AN </p><p>INFORMATION ITEM.  SIDE EVENTS OF NOTE INCLUDED A DYNAMIC </p><p>(AND VERY POSITIVE) PRESENTATION FROM FAO\'S </p><p>INTERDEPARTMENTAL WORKING GROUP ON BIOTECHNOLOGY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  THE U.S. DELEGATION WAS HEADED BY AMBASSADOR TONY </p><p>HALL AND COMPRISED THE FOLLOWING DELEGATES: ADELA </p><p>BACKIEL, DIRECTOR OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT, USDA; BOBBY </p><p>RICHEY, DIRECTOR, FOOD SAFETY AND TECHNICAL SECURITY, </p><p>FOREIGN AGRICULTURAL SERVICE (FAS), USDA; RICHARD HUGHES, </p><p>USDA/FAS; SHARON KOTOK, FOREIGN AFFAIRS OFFICER, OFFICE </p><p>OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AFFAIRS, DEPARTMENT OF STATE; </p><p>RALPH CUMMINGS, SENIOR ECONOMIST, BUREAU OF ECONOMIC </p><p>GROWTH, AGRICULTURE AND TRADE, USAID AND U.S. MISSION </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES LUCY TAMLYN AND KATIE NISHIURA.

THE FAO DIRECTOR OF PROGRAM PLANNING AND BUDGET </p><p>ADVISED DELEGATES THAT THE PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION REPORT </p><p>(PIR) WAS IN THE PROCESS OF BEING REVISED.

IN REVIEWING PAST YEARS\' PROGRAMS, </p><p>MEMBERS HIGHLIGHTED THE IMPORTANCE OF THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>STANDARD-SETTING BODIES, SUCH AS THE CODEX ALIMENTARIUS </p><p>AND INTERNATIONAL PLANT PROTECTION CONVENTION (IPPC) AND </p><p>TRADE-RELATED CAPACITY BUILDING. </p><p> </p><p>MEDIUM TERM PLAN AND PRELIMINARY PROPOSALS FOR WORK AND </p><p>BUDGET 2004-2005 </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p> </p><p>5. AMBASSADOR TONY P. HALL DELIVERED THE U.S. </p><p>INTERVENTION ON THE MEDIUM-TERM PLAN 2004-2009 AND THE </p><p>PRELIMINARY PROPOSALS ON THE PROGRAM OF WORK AND BUDGET, </p><p>2004-2005.  THE U.S. STATEMENT EMPHASIZED THE IMPORTANCE </p><p>OF FAO DEPLOYING ITS LIMITED RESOURCES EFFECTIVELY IN </p><p>SUPPORT OF GLOBAL FOOD SECURITY AND ASSISTING POOR </p><p>FARMERS IMPROVE PRODUCTIVITY AND INCOMES.  IT UNDERSCORED </p><p>THE IMPORTANCE OF ADDRESSING THE SERIOUS IMPACT OF </p><p>HIV/AIDS ON AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY, PARTICULARLY IN </p><p>AFRICA AND STRESSED THE IMPORTANCE OF THE WTO-RECOGNIZED </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ8903 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  01658  02 OF 06  171334Z </p><p>ACTION IO-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00  COME-00  CTME-00  INL-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  ITCE-00  WHA-00   SRPP-00  EB-00    EXME-00  EUR-00 </p><p>      OIGO-00  E-00     UTED-00  FDRE-01  VC-00    FRB-00   H-01 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   ITC-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00 </p><p>      NSCE-00  OES-00   OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  ACE-00   SSO-00 </p><p>      SS-00    STR-00   TEST-00  TRSE-00  USIE-00  EPAE-00  DRL-01 </p><p>      G-00     SAS-00     /010W </p><p>                  ------------------576E31  171344Z /38 </p><p>R 171333Z APR 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 9321 </p><p>USDA FAS WASHDC 2623 </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p>AMEMBASSY MEXICO </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA </p><p>USMISSION UNVIE VIENNA </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 06 ROME 001658 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FROM FODAG </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR IO/EDA WINNICK AND KOTOK </p><p>USDA/FAS FOR REICH AND HUGHES </p><p>MEXICO CITY FOR BRAKEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS:  AORC, FAO, EAGR, ETRD </p><p>SUBJECT:  FAO COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE 17TH SESSION </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  01658  02 OF 06  171334Z </p><p> </p><p>FOOD SAFETY AND PLANT HEALTH STANDARD SETTING BODIES AND </p><p>OF SUPPORT FOR BIOTECHNOLOGY TO MEET GLOBAL FOOD </p><p>PRODUCTION NEEDS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  AS IN OTHER FAO COMMITTEES, MEMBERS WELCOMED THE </p><p>OPPORTUNITY TO EXAMINE THE BUDGET PROPOSALS IN ADVANCE OF </p><p>THE FAO COUNCIL.  DEVELOPING COUNTRIES (CHINA, INDIA, </p><p>INDONESIA, ZIMBABWE) EXPRESSED STRONG SUPPORT FOR FAO\'S </p><p>SPECIAL PROGRAM FOR FOOD SECURITY (SPFS), CALLING IT </p><p>"VERY USEFUL" (INDONESIA) AND "PRODUCING TANGIBLE </p><p>RESULTS" (CHINA).  MOST DEVELOPING COUNTRIES EMPHASIZED </p><p>THE NEED FOR GREATER CAPACITY BUILDING AND TRAINING.  THE </p><p>REPUBLIC OF KOREA SUPPORTED A ZERO REAL GROWTH (ZRG) </p><p>BUDGET, BUT NOTED THAT ZRG DIDN\'T HAVE TO MEAN "NO </p><p>GROWTH" FOR IMPORTANT PROGRAMS SUCH AS THE INTERIM </p><p>COMMISSION ON PHYTOSANITARY MEASURES (ICPM).  DEVELOPED </p><p>AND DEVELOPING COUNTRIES ALIKE EXPRESSED THE NEED FOR </p><p>ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO SUPPORT THE ICPM\'S WORK PROGRAM. </p><p> </p><p>SETTING PRIORITIES - WHOSE JOB? </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. IN HIS INTRODUCTION TO THE MEDIUM TERM PLAN AND THE </p><p>BUDGET PROPOSALS FOR 2004-2005, DIRECTOR OF PROGRAM </p><p>BUDGET AND PLANNING, TONY WADE, ARGUED THAT REAL BUDGET </p><p>INCREASES WERE NEEDED IN ORDER TO SATISFY ALL THE NEEDS </p><p>IDENTIFIED BY MEMBERS.  HE COMMENTED THAT, SINCE MEMBERS </p><p>WERE UNABLE TO PRIORITIZE (AND THE SECRETARIAT COULD </p><p>NOT), THE ONLY SOLUTION WAS FOR MEMBERS TO LOBBY THEIR </p><p>AUTHORITIES TO APPROVE A REAL GROWTH BUDGET. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01658  02 OF 06  171334Z </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT:  OECD MEMBERS WERE UNIFORMLY UNHAPPY WITH THE </p><p>SECRETARIAT\'S STATEMENT; THE EU INTERVENED A SECOND TIME </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>TO STATE THAT THE SECRETARIAT SHOULD TAKE A MORE ACTIVE </p><p>ROLE IN GUIDING MEMBERSHIP IN SETTING PRIORITIES. </p><p>IRONICALLY, THE ONE PROGRAM INDICATED BY USDEL AND </p><p>AUSTRALIA AS LOW PRIORITY (THE ETHICS PROGRAM) WAS SAVED </p><p>AFTER FRANTIC SECRETARIAT LOBBYING ON THE FLOOR SUCCEEDED </p><p>IN PERSUADING A MEMBER (COSTA RICA) TO SUPPORT IT.  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>GLOBAL FORUM ON FOOD SAFETY REGULATORS </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  UNDER THE PROGRAM OF WORK AND BUDGET, MEMBERS ALSO </p><p>DISCUSSED THE POSSIBILITY OF CONVENING IN 2004 (IN A </p><p>DEVELOPING COUNTRY) A SECOND GLOBAL FORUM OF FOOD SAFETY </p><p>REGULATORS WHICH WOULD CONTRIBUTE TO THE STANDARD-SETTING </p><p>WORK OF THE CODEX ALIMENTARIUS COMMISSION.  FUNDING WOULD </p><p>BE REQUIRED. </p><p> </p><p>FOOD CHAIN STRATEGY </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  THE FAO INTRODUCED ITS "STRATEGY FOR A FOOD CHAIN </p><p>APPROACH FOR FOOD SAFETY AND QUALITY."  THE ITEM </p><p>ORIGINATED IN THE REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON WORLD FOOD </p><p>SECURITY IN 2002 WHICH HAD REQUESTED THAT COAG OUTLINE </p><p>FAO\'S STRATEGIES TO ADDRESS KEY POLICY ADVICE, CAPACITY </p><p>BUILDING, TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND ACTIONS THAT NEED TO </p><p>BE TAKEN AT NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL LEVELS FOR </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01658  02 OF 06  171334Z </p><p>ENSURING ACCESS TO SAFE AND NUTRITIOUS FOOD. MANY </p><p>COUNTRIES EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT THE FAO PAPER </p><p>SIGNIFICANTLY ENLARGED AND ALTERED THE ORIGINAL CFS </p><p>REQUEST (NOT LEAST BEING TO ADD "QUALITY").  THE U.S. </p><p>RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT THE PROCESS USED TO ARRIVE AT THE </p><p>APPROACH AND THE USE OF VAGUE, UNDEFINED TERMS SUCH AS </p><p>"HOLISTIC", "PRUDENT APPROACH" AND "TRACEABILITY." </p><p>AUSTRALIA ARGUED THAT A FOOD CHAIN APPROACH SHOULD NOT BE </p><p>SADDLED WITH "COLLATERAL" ISSUES SUCH AS SUSTAINABLE </p><p>DEVELOPMENT AND COMPLIANCE WITH INTERNATIONAL TREATIES; </p><p>NOR SHOULD THE FOOD CHAIN TAKE ON ACTIVITIES MORE </p><p>PROPERLY BELONGING TO THE MARKET (SUCH AS SATISFYING </p><p>CONSUMER TASTES).  MOST COAG MEMBERS FELT THAT "A" FOOD </p><p>CHAIN APPROACH TO FOOD SAFETY WAS ACCEPTABLE (AND WAS, IN </p><p>FACT THE APPROACH THAT GUIDED MANY COUNTRIES </p><p>DOMESTICALLY) BUT EXPRESSED DIFFERING OPINIONS ON THE </p><p>SCOPE AS PRESENTED BY FAO. THE IMPORTANCE OF SCIENCE- </p><p>BASED RISK ASSESSMENT WAS ACKNOWLEDGED BY ALL MEMBERS AS </p><p>WELL AS ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF THE IMPORTANCE OF CAPACITY </p><p>BUILDING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND THE ROLE OF CODEX, </p><p>IPPC AND OIE IN ANY FOOD CHAIN APPROACH. HOWEVER, THE </p><p>EUROPEAN COMMISSION AND LIKE-MINDED COUNTRIES INDICATED </p><p>THAT ETHICS AND THE PRECAUTIONARY PRINCIPLE SHOULD BE </p><p>INCLUDED IN THE "FOOD CHAIN APPROACH."

AS THE COMMITTEE COULD NOT REACH CONSENSUS ON THE </p><p>DOCUMENT, AUSTRALIA AND U.S. DEL SOUGHT TO ENSURE THAT </p><p>THE PROPOSED BUDGET (SOME USD 950,000) WOULD NOT BE SPENT </p><p>ON THE FOOD CHAIN STRATEGY IN THE NEXT BIENNIUM BUT WOULD </p><p>BE USED INSTEAD FOR HIGHER PRIORITY ITEMS (SUCH AS THE </p><p>ICPM).  THE NEGOTIATED OUTCOME INCLUDES A REQUEST FOR THE </p><p>SECRETARIAT TO RE-DRAFT THE PAPER AND RE-SUBMIT TO THE </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>NEXT COAG SESSION.  THE REPORT ALSO NOTES THAT "A FEW </p><p>MEMBERS FELT THAT THE PROPOSED BUDGET ALLOCATION FOR THIS </p><p>WORK WOULD NEED TO BE REVIEWED." </p><p> </p><p>11. COMMENT:  THE DEEP DISAGREEMENT OVER THE FAO\'S </p><p>PROPOSED STRATEGY FOR A "FOOD CHAIN APPROACH" PRESENTED A </p><p>NOVEL OPPORTUNITY FOR MEMBERS TO LINK PROGRAMS WITH </p><p>RESOURCES (OR, IN THIS CASE, TO ATTEMPT TO DENY FUNDING </p><p>TO A PROGRAM WHICH DID NOT MEET WITH CONSENSUS APPROVAL). </p><p>NOT SURPRISINGLY, THE EFFORTS OF AUSTRALIA, SUPPORTED BY </p><p>THE U.S., TO BLOCK FUNDING FOR "FOOD CHAIN" ACTIVITIES </p><p>PROVOKED A STORM OF PROTESTS (NOT LEAST -- BUT MUFFLED, </p><p>OF COURSE-- FROM THE SECRETARIAT).  RECOGNIZING THAT SUCH </p><p>A TACTIC MUST BE USED JUDICIOUSLY, AS IT COULD WELL BE </p><p>TURNED AGAINST ONE\'S OWN PRIORITY PROGRAMS, AUSTRALIA AND </p><p>THE U.S. EVENTUALLY BACKED OFF.  THE LANGUAGE OF THE </p><p>REPORT MAKES CLEAR, HOWEVER, THAT COAG AT NO POINT </p><p>"ENDORSED" THE DOCUMENT.  IT ALSO LEAVES AN IMPORTANT </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01658  03 OF 06  171334Z </p><p>TRAIL TO BE FOLLOWED UP ON BY THE UPCOMING PROGRAM AND </p><p>FINANCE COMMITTEES, WHICH ARE THE APPROPRIATE BODIES TO </p><p>TAKE FURTHER ACTION ON THIS ISSUE.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>GOOD AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12. THE FAO\'S PROPOSED "FRAMEWORK FOR GOOD AGRICULTURAL </p><p>PRACTICES" (GAP) REVIEWED THE DEVELOPMENT OF A LIST OF </p><p>GOOD AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES FOR FAO TO USE IN ITS </p><p>TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS WITH MEMBER NATIONS TO </p><p>FURTHER ACTIONS FOR SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE AND RURAL </p><p>DEVELOPMENT.  MEMBERS GENERALLY SUPPORTED THE NOTION OF </p><p>GOOD AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES ALTHOUGH (WITH THE EXCEPTION </p><p>OF THE EU) THEY REFUSED TO CONSIDER IT A "FRAMEWORK" OR A </p><p>SYSTEM.  RATHER, MOST COUNTRIES EMPHASIZED THAT THERE </p><p>WERE DIVERSE WAYS TO APPROACH GAP AND THAT A GAP APPROACH </p><p>SHOULD BE VOLUNTARY, NON-REGULATORY, NOT IMPLY ANY GLOBAL </p><p>STANDARD AND NOT CREATE NEW BARRIERS TO TRADE.  THE </p><p>LINKAGE BY THE DELEGATE OF POLAND OF GAP TO </p><p>MULTIFUNCTIONALITY AROUSED CONCERNS IN CAIRNS GROUP AND </p><p>THE U.S. THAT THE GAP "FRAMEWORK" MIGHT BE A STALKING </p><p>HORSE FOR MULTIFUNCTIONALITY.   THE PAPER WILL BE </p><p>REVIEWED AT THE NEXT COAG. </p><p> </p><p>SUSTAINABLE RURAL LIVELIHOODS </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  MEMBERS GENERALLY SUPPORTED THE WORK OF FAO IN </p><p>INTEGRATING A RURAL LIVELIHOOD APPROACH INTO ITS EXISTING </p><p>PROGRAMS, IN PARTICULAR THE FAO\'S SPECIAL PROGRAM FOR </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01658  03 OF 06  171334Z </p><p>FOOD SECURITY (SPFS).  RURAL LIVELIHOODS IN THIS INSTANCE </p><p>MEANS PARTICIPATORY APPROACHES THAT HELP EMPOWER RURAL </p><p>COMMUNITIES AND INDIVIDUALS IN DIVERSIFYING RURAL </p><p>INCOMES, SUPPORTING GOOD GOVERNANCE ACTIVITIES, AND </p><p>BUILDING CAPACITY OF SMALL FARMERS AND RURAL BUSINESSES. </p><p>COAG NOTED THAT WORK NEEDED TO FOCUS ON AREAS OF FAO\'S </p><p>COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE AND FOSTER PARTNERSHIPS FOR GREATER </p><p>EFFICIENCIES AND COLLABORATION. COAG REQUESTED FURTHER </p><p>INFORMATION ON SUCCESS STORIES WHERE THE LIVELIHOODS </p><p>APPROACH HAS REDUCED RURAL POVERTY.  (COMMENT: THE REAL </p><p>SUCCESS STORY HERE IS THAT OF THE UK DELEGATION, WHICH, </p><p>BY STRATEGICALLY PLACING A UK-FUNDED DFID ADVISOR IN FAO </p><p>HAS INTEGRATED THE UK\'S MAJOR DEVELOPMENT THEME INTO FAO </p><p>PROGRAMS.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>AGRI-ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATION AND DECISION SUPPORT TOOLS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p> </p><p>14.

COAG DISCUSSED THE TOPIC OF BIOSECURITY FOR A SECOND </p><p>TIME. (THE TOPIC WAS ORIGINALLY INTRODUCED AT THE 16TH </p><p>SESSION OF COAG).  THE U.S. RE-EMPHASIZED ITS VIEWS FROM </p><p>THE 16TH SESSION AND EXPRESSED CONCERNS ABOUT THE VAGUE </p><p>AND WIDE-RANGING NATURE OF THE DOCUMENT AND THE LACK OF A </p><p>DEFINITION OF BIOSECURITY. MANY COUNTRIES HIGHLIGHTED </p><p>THAT CAPACITY BUILDING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WERE KEY </p><p>IN ADDRESSING DEVELOPING COUNTRIES NEEDS FOR ANIMAL </p><p>HEALTH, PLANT HEALTH AND FOOD SAFETY.

A NUMBER OF AFRICAN COUNTRIES EXPRESSED </p><p>CONCERN THAT RECOMMENDATIONS ON SUGAR INTAKE COULD HAVE </p><p>AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON SMALL SUGAR PRODUCERS AND THE </p><p>ECONOMIES OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.  OBSERVERS FROM </p><p>INDUSTRY GROUPS ARGUED FOR SCIENCE-BASED FINDINGS.  USDEL </p><p>INTERVENED TO STATE THAT THE "BEST POSSIBLE SCIENTIFIC </p><p>AND PUBLIC HEALTH EVIDENCE SHOULD BE THE CORNERSTONE OF </p><p>THE 2004 GLOBAL STRATEGY ON DIET, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND </p><p>HEALTH." WHILE THE REPORT WAS NOT INTENDED TO BE AN </p><p>ACTION ITEM FOR ANY FAO INTERGOVERNMENTAL BODY, MEMBERS </p><p>REQUESTED THAT THE SECRETARIAT CONVENE COAG "AS SOON AS </p><p>POSSIBLE" SO THAT MEMBERS COULD "REVIEW" THE REPORT. </p><p>COMMENT: NEITHER WE (NOR THE SECRETARIAT) KNOW WHEN THIS </p><p>WILL BE.
