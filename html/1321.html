<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 BEIRUT 004016 </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR NEA AND SMEC </p><p>PARIS FOR WIENER/O\'FRIEL; LONDON FOR SUTPHIN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/23/07 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, LE, SY </p><p>SUBJECT:  SLOUCHING TOWARD THE GRAND SERAIL (II) -- </p><p>          SYRIA CLOSES THE DEAL; HARIRI APPOINTMENT </p><p>          AS PM EXPECTED IMMINENTLY </p><p> </p><p>REFS: A) BEIRUT 3914, B) BEIRUT 3962 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR DAVID M. SATTERFIELD. REASON </p><p>1.5 B AND D. </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY:  FORMER PM HARIRI IS EXPECTED TO BE </p><p>NAMED VERY SHORTLY AS LEBANON\'S NEXT PRIME MINISTER, </p><p>WITH A NEW CABINET PRESENTED FOR PARLIAMENTARY APPROVAL </p><p>WITHIN THE WEEK.  THE GREEN LIGHT FOR HARIRI\'S </p><p>APPOINTMENT WAS GIVEN BY SYRIA FOLLOWING EXTENSIVE </p><p>CONSULTATIONS IN CAIRO AND HERE OVER THE WEEKEND, WITH </p><p>ALL BUT A HANDFUL OF MINISTERIAL PORTFOLIOS AND </p><p>CANDIDATES AGREED UPON.  SYRIAN PRESIDENT BASHAR IS </p><p>REPORTED TO HAVE PROVIDED OVERALL POLITICAL BLESSING TO </p><p>THE DEAL AND ITS SELLING TO LEBANESE PRESIDENT LAHOUD, </p><p>WHILE SYRIAN MILITARY INTELLIGENCE LEBANON BOSS KANAAN </p><p>HANDLED THE DETAILS WITH HIS LEBANESE COUNTERPART JAMIL </p><p>AL-SAYYID.  WHILE SOME KEY PORTFOLIOS -- NOTABLY FINANCE </p><p>-- REMAIN IN SUSPENSE BETWEEN HARIRI, LAHOUD AND SPEAKER </p><p>BERRI, THE OUTLINES OF A NEW GOVERNMENT NOW APPEAR SET. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>HARIRI GETS THE SYRIAN NOD </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) OUTGOING PM HOSS MET WITH AMBASSADOR OCTOBER 23 </p><p>TO DISCUSS LEBANESE-SYRIAN MEETINGS DURING THE COURSE OF </p><p>THE CAIRO ARAB SUMMIT AND AGREEMENT REACHED ON </p><p>COMPOSITION OF THE NEXT LEBANESE GOVERNMENT (OTHER </p><p>TOPICS SEPTEL).  A VISIBLY RELAXED AND UNUSUALLY VOLUBLE </p><p>PM HOSS TOLD AMBASSADOR THAT PRESS REPORTING WAS </p><p>CORRECT; FORMER PM HARIRI WOULD BE NAMED AS HIS </p><p>SUCCESSOR EVENING OCTOBER 23/MORNING OCTOBER 24, </p><p>FOLLOWING PRO-FORMA CONSULTATIONS BY LAHOUD WITH THE </p><p>PARLIAMENT.  (NOTE:  AT TIME OF DRAFTING, HARIRI HAD </p><p>RECEIVED THE ENDORSEMENT OF 87 DEPUTIES (128 TOTAL). </p><p>THE HIZBALLAH BLOC REFUSED TO BACK ANY CANDIDATE AND ARE </p><p>NOW WIDELY EXPECTED TO REMAIN OUT OF THE CABINET.  END </p><p>NOTE.)  WHILE LAHOUD HAD INDEED ATTEMPTED (REF A) TO </p><p>DEFER THE DECISION AS LONG AS POSSIBLE, HOSS SAID THAT </p><p>BASHAR AL-ASAD HAD BROUGHT MATTERS TO A HEAD IN CAIRO, </p><p>PARALLELING SETS OF MEETINGS OVER THE WEEKEND HERE </p><p>BETWEEN SYRIAN MILITARY INTELLIGENCE LEBANON HEAD GHAZI </p><p>KANAAN AND PM HARIRI/DRUZE LEADER JUMBLATT/SPEAKER NABIH </p><p>BERRI. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) HOSS SAID THAT BASHAR\'S ROLE WAS NOT IN THE </p><p>DETAILS -- "HE HAS NO IDEA WHO MOST OF THE NEXT CABINET </p><p>APPOINTEES ARE" -- BUT IN GIVING HIS BLESSING TO THE </p><p>BROAD OUTLINES OF THE GOVERNMENT AND SELLING THE DEAL TO </p><p>LAHOUD.  THE SPECIFICS ON NAMES AND PORTFOLIOS HAD BEEN </p><p>MANAGED, HOSS SAID, BY LEBANESE GENERAL SECURITY CHIEF </p><p>JAMIL AL-SAYYID (IN CAIRO WITH LAHOUD) AND KANAAN. </p><p>WHILE KAANAN WORKED THE PLAYERS ON THE GROUND IN </p><p>LEBANON, SYRIAN VP KHADDAM AND FM SHARA DEALT DIRECTLY </p><p>WITH AL-SAYYID TO PRESENT A NEAR-FINAL PACKAGE TO </p><p>LAHOUD.  COMMENTING ON KHADDAM\'S ROLE, HOSS EXPLAINED </p><p>THAT BASHAR WAS CONCERNED THAT HARIRI WOULD ATTEMPT TO </p><p>USE HIS "TRADITIONAL SYRIAN ALLIES" (READ KHADDAM AND </p><p>FORMER COS SHIHABI) TO MANEUVER FOR GREATER FREEDOM OF </p><p>ACTION.  BASHAR HAD THEREFORE BROUGHT KHADDAM VISIBLY </p><p>INTO THE PROCESS OF DETERMINING THE NEW LEBANESE CABINET </p><p>AT HIS AND KAANAN\'S SIDE, "SO HARIRI WOULD UNDERSTAND </p><p>THAT HE CANNOT PLAY ALTERNATE CHANNELS." </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>FINANCE AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS STILL IN PLAY </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) COMMENTING ON THE COMPOSITION OF THE NEXT </p><p>CABINET, HOSS SAID THAT NEITHER HARIRI NOR LAHOUD GOT </p><p>EVERYTHING (OR EVERYONE) THEY WANTED, BUT ON BALANCE THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT "SHOULD PROVE GENERALLY HOMOGENEOUS."  THAT </p><p>SAID, SOME SIGNIFICANT ISSUES REMAINED IN SUSPENSE.  IN </p><p>PARTICULAR, HARIRI WAS INSISTING ON THE RIGHT TO APPOINT </p><p>HIS CANDIDATE (ECONOMIC CONSULTANT BASIL FLEIHAN) AS </p><p>MINISTER OF STATE FOR FINANCE AND BERRI WAS PUSHING FOR </p><p>THE JOB TO GO TO A SHIA.  HARIRI HIMSELF WOULD BE </p><p>FINANCE MINISTER, AS IN HIS LAST GOVERNMENT.   LAHOUD </p><p>OBJECTED TO HARIRI OR BERRI PLACING THEIR LOYALIST IN </p><p>THE FINANCE MINSTATE POST, AND THE SYRIANS -- HOSS </p><p>CLAIMED -- HAD NOT SETTLED THE ISSUE.  THE OTHER MAJOR </p><p>UNRESOLVED PORTFOLIO WAS FOREIGN AFFAIRS.  HOSS SAID </p><p>THAT A FORMER CAREER DIPLOMAT AND BERRI SUPPORTER, </p><p>MAHMOUD HAMMOUD (NOW RETIRED; LAST POST WAS AMBASSADOR </p><p>TO LONDON), WAS THE PRIME SHIA CANDIDATE -- BUT IT WAS </p><p>STILL A MARGINAL POSSIBILITY THAT THE MARONITES (BALKING </p><p>AT HAVING TO SETTLE FOR THE MEANINGLESS DEFENSE </p><p>MINISTRY) WOULD WIND UP WITH JOB. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>ONE MURR OUT; ANOTHER MURR IN? </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) CONTRADICTING EARLIER INDICATIONS (REF B), </p><p>PRESENT DEPUTY PM AND INTERIOR MINISTER MICHEL MURR </p><p>APPEARS TO BE OUT OF THE NEXT GOVERNMENT, REPLACED -- IN </p><p>THE BEST LEBANESE TRADITION -- BY HIS SON, ELIAS.  HOSS </p><p>SAID THAT HARIRI INSISTED ON OUSTING MURR SENIOR; THE </p><p>SYRIANS, HOWEVER, BACKED MURR\'S DEMAND FOR COMPENSATION </p><p>AND HAD AGREED TO LAHOUD\'S REQUEST THAT MURR THE YOUNGER </p><p>(LAHOUD\'S SON-IN-LAW AND ADVISOR) TAKE HIS FATHER\'S </p><p>PLACE AT THE INTERIOR MINISTRY.  WHILE THIS RESOLVED THE </p><p>MURR ISSUE, HOSS NOTED THAT IT CREATED A NEW PROBLEM FOR </p><p>BASHAR ALLY (AND 2004 PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL) SULEIMAN </p><p>FRANJIYEH, JR.  FRANJIYEH HAD COVETED INTERIOR AND WOULD </p><p>NOW, IT APPEARED, HAVE TO BE SATISFIED WITH A LESSER </p><p>POST -- POSSIBLY A RETURN TO THE HEALTH MINISTRY. </p><p>REPLACING MURR AS DEPUTY PM WOULD BE NEWLY-ELECTED </p><p>DEPUTY AND MULTI-MILLIONAIRE ISSAM FARES. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>BUT WHAT DOES IT ALL MEAN? </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) REFLECTING ON THE PAST TWO YEARS, HOSS TOLD </p><p>AMBASSADOR THAT HE RECOGNIZED POPULAR DISAPPOINTMENT </p><p>THAT MORE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN ACCOMPLISHED BY HIS </p><p>GOVERNMENT.  HOSS DOUBTED, HOWEVER, THAT HARIRI\'S LUCK </p><p>WOULD BE MUCH BETTER.  HOSS EXPECTED THAT, WHATEVER THE </p><p>SHAPE OF THE NEW CABINET, LEBANON\'S DESTRUCTIVE </p><p>CONFESSIONAL AND SELF-SERVING PERSONAL POLITICS WOULD </p><p>ASSERT THEMSELVES AND THWART "EVEN HARIRI\'S" EFFORTS. </p><p>IN ADDITION, HOSS EXPRESSED HIS PERSONAL VIEW THAT </p><p>LAHOUD AND HARIRI WOULD "BE AT EACH OTHER\'S THROATS" </p><p>WITHIN MONTHS -- LEADING TO CONTINUOUS SYRIAN </p><p>INTERVENTION TO SETTLE DIFFERENCES.  IN THE END, HOSS </p><p>SAID THAT HE BELIEVED DAMASCUS WAS NOT UNAWARE OF THE </p><p>LIKELY NEGATIVE COURSE AHEAD.  IF HARIRI WAS BURNED, </p><p>THROUGH FAILURE TO RESOLVE LEBANON\'S ECONOMIC CRISIS, </p><p>THEN "ALTERNATIVES" WOULD EMERGE TO TAKE HIS PLACE. </p><p>HOSS SAW NAJIB MIQATI (CERTAIN TO BE IN THE NEW </p><p>GOVERNMENT) AS THE MOST LIKELY REPLACEMENT CANDIDATE, </p><p>BUT NOTED "MAYBE I WILL BE BACK SOMEDAY IN THIS OFFICE, </p><p>TOO." </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>WHO RUNS SYRIA? </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE MEETING, HOSS ADVISOR </p><p>MAHMASANI, WHO HAD BEEN WITH THE PM IN CAIRO, TOOK </p><p>AMBASSADOR ASIDE.  MAHMASANI SAID THAT THE PM AND LAHOUD </p><p>HAD BEEN "VERY SURPRISED" AT THE DEGREE TO WHICH BASHAR </p><p>HAD NOT APPEARED "IN CHARGE" DURING THE MEETINGS WITH </p><p>THE LEBANESE SIDE.  SHARA AND KHADDAM HAD DOMINATED THE </p><p>SHOW, WITH BASHAR SHOWING ONLY A "VERY BASIC GRASP" OF </p><p>LEBANESE PERSONALITIES AND ISSUES.  AMBASSADOR NOTED </p><p>THAT THIS APPEARED VERY MUCH IN LINE WITH HAFIZ AL- </p><p>ASAD\'S MANNER OF DEALING WITH THE LEBANESE, LEAVING </p><p>DETAILS TO SUBORDINATES.  MAHMASANI CONCEDED THE POINT, </p><p>BUT REITERATED WHAT HE TERMED "OUR PERCEPTION" THAT THE </p><p>OLD GUARD IN DAMASCUS, INCLUDING "THE MOST RETROGRADE </p><p>ELEMENTS OF THE BA\'ATH REGIONAL COMMAND," WERE RUNNING </p><p>THE SHOW -- NOT BASHAR. </p><p> </p><p>SATTERFIELD </p><p></p></div>
