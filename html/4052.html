<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 COLOMBO 001979 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT PLEASE PASS TO DEPUTY USTR AMBASSADOR HUNTSMAN FROM AMBASSADOR </p><p>WILLS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  10/23/2012 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, ETRD, CE, WTO, USTR, ECONOMICS, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  SCENESETTER FOR DEPUTY USTR HUNTSMAN\'S NOVEMBER </p><p>VISIT TO SRI LANKA </p><p> </p><p>Classified By:  Ambassador E. Ashley Wills.  Reasons 1.5 (b, d) </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>Executive Summary </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) I extend to you a warm welcome in advance of your </p><p>visit to Sri Lanka next month for the first meeting of the </p><p>U.S. - Sri Lankan Trade and Investment Council (TIC).  I am </p><p>sending this message now, nearly a month before your visit, </p><p>because I know that you and your team are already busy </p><p>preparing for your meetings here.  I see your visit, and the </p><p>Trade and Investment Framework (TIFA) process in general, as </p><p>critical to advancing U.S. trade interests here in Sri Lanka, </p><p>and I want to provide now the context needed to make your </p><p>visit a success. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Your visit comes at an exciting time, with Sri Lanka </p><p>facing its best chance for peace in many years.  A cease-fire </p><p>has been in place since December 2001, and the government and </p><p>Tamil Tigers just sat down for constructive face-to-face </p><p>talks, which are due to continue later this year.  The </p><p>situation remains fluid, however, with the intentions of the </p><p>Tamil Tigers unclear.  The peace process could also be </p><p>undermined by domestic fissures, such as cohabitation </p><p>stresses between the PM and the President, and tensions </p><p>between the Muslim community and the LTTE.  Even if GSL and </p><p>the LTTE do reach a peace settlement, its efficacy and </p><p>durability will depend largely on economic factors - </p><p>specifically the extent to which Sri Lanka is able to achieve </p><p>economic growth island-wide in the coming years.  Strong </p><p>growth will vest all Sri Lankans in peace; if growth falters, </p><p>the government and the peace process will be especially </p><p>vulnerable to the pressures noted above. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) The U.S. is by far the largest trading partner of this </p><p>trade-dependent nation, consuming nearly 40% of total exports </p><p>in 2001.  It is thus no exaggeration to say that the U.S. </p><p>trade relationship plays a critical part in Sri Lanka\'s quest </p><p>for peace.  The Sri Lankans understand this, and they are </p><p>likely to ask you for trade concessions in support of the </p><p>peace process.  Still, as much as we want to see Sri Lanka </p><p>achieve peace and increased prosperity, I do not believe we </p><p>should be seduced into granting one-way trade concessions. </p><p>Far from it: I see your upcoming visit and the longer-term </p><p>TIFA process as an opportunity to push GSL to make the right </p><p>choices on economic reform and further opening its markets to </p><p>U.S. goods.  Making these tough choices will do more to </p><p>strengthen Sri Lanka\'s economy and bolster the chances for </p><p>long-term peace than trade concessions from the U.S. ever </p><p>could.  For me, trade concessions should be reciprocal. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Consistent with the draft agenda that your team has </p><p>developed, I see three main areas where your visit can </p><p>advance U.S. interests.  First, the TIFA can promote U.S. </p><p>exports by focusing the GSL\'s attention on the massive 10:1 </p><p>trade imbalance between our two nations, and by discussing </p><p>specific ways to right it.  Second, the TIFA can help GSL </p><p>summon the courage to make the difficult economic reforms </p><p>necessary to improve the investment climate here.  Third, the </p><p>TIFA can identify ways to work with GSL in promoting our </p><p>common WTO goals, thereby lending additional support to </p><p>objectives one and two above.  I believe strongly that </p><p>pursuing these goals with vigor will result in big benefits </p><p>to U.S. business, not just in Sri Lanka but in South Asia as </p><p>a whole.  If GSL makes real progress on these fronts, I </p><p>believe further that it is in the U.S. interest to consider </p><p>an FTA with Sri Lanka.  End Executive Summary. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>Promoting U.S. Exports </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) The bilateral trade picture is dominated by a massive </p><p>10:1 trade imbalance in Sri Lanka\'s favor.  The imbalance is </p><p>mainly due to large Sri Lankan apparel exports to the U.S. </p><p>($1.5 billion in 2001, or nearly 75% of total Sri Lankan </p><p>exports to the U.S.)  Sri Lanka\'s success in apparel </p><p>manufacturing is partly attributable to a favorable deal on </p><p>U.S. quotas, and partly attributable to Sri Lanka\'s success </p><p>in positioning itself as a low-cost, reliable supplier to the </p><p>upper-middle end of the U.S. retail sector (with The Limited, </p><p>Inc., Liz Claiborne and Federated Department stores some of </p><p>the major importers of Sri Lankan apparel). </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) While the U.S. absorbs nearly 40% of Sri Lankan </p><p>exports, our share of Sri Lankan imports is less than 4%. </p><p>(Note: Main U.S. exports to Sri Lanka are wheat (35% of the </p><p>total), followed by yarns/fabric and electrical machinery. </p><p>End Note.)  Yet Sri Lanka runs an overall trade deficit of $1 </p><p>billion.  It is importing plenty of goods, just not from the </p><p>U.S.; main sources of Sri Lanka\'s imports are India (10%), </p><p>Hong Kong (8%) and Singapore (7%).  While this trend is due </p><p>in part to stronger commercial and historical links with </p><p>Asia, it is also due to a lack of transparency that </p><p>disadvantages American suppliers. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) I have been pushing GSL hard on every bid that comes </p><p>up here, and have made good progress recently with </p><p>significant power deals going the way of AES and General </p><p>Electric.  Still, there is a lot of business here yet to be </p><p>won by U.S. companies.  Your visit is an opportunity to put </p><p>GSL on notice that we are keeping score, and that doing more </p><p>for U.S. exports will help the overall trade relationship. </p><p>Key areas where U.S. exports can be competitive are mass </p><p>transit (buses, locomotive engines), power equipment, and </p><p>textile fabric. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) Sri Lanka flirted last year with a ban on biotech </p><p>foods that would have set a precedent injurious to our global </p><p>trade interests.  This mission\'s aggressive lobbying, along </p><p>with a strong letter from USTR Zoellick, helped convince GSL </p><p>to drop the ban.  Your visit is an opportunity to press GSL </p><p>to keep its market open to biotech products and especially to </p><p>steer clear of any harmful labeling schemes. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>Improving the Investment Climate </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) Sri Lanka is eager to lure more U.S. investment to the </p><p>country.  Sri Lanka as a whole is under-invested, and U.S. </p><p>investment here (book value) is a modest $150 million.  The </p><p>ethnic conflict is only partly to blame; the local investment </p><p>climate, while much better than elsewhere in South Asia, is </p><p>far from perfect.  Sri Lanka has the advantage of having </p><p>opened its economy in the late 1970s, earlier than its </p><p>neighbors.  That wave of reforms led to a surge in foreign </p><p>investment (mainly from Asia) and a rise in living standards </p><p>in and around Colombo, where most of the investment was </p><p>focused. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U) Twenty five years later, in spite of a long-running </p><p>civil war, Sri Lankans enjoy the highest GDP per capita </p><p>($850) of any nation in the region (except tiny Maldives). </p><p>Now GSL stands on the brink of enacting a second wave of </p><p>economic reforms that have the potential (against a backdrop </p><p>of peace) to lead to unprecedented rates of economic growth. </p><p>GSL has been vocal about what reforms need to take place - </p><p>better protection of intellectual property, further </p><p>privatization, shrinking of the regulatory role of </p><p>government, more employer-friendly labor laws and improved </p><p>transparency.  Yet GSL has taken very little action, </p><p>preferring to move with caution given the government\'s thin </p><p>parliamentary majority and the fragility of the peace </p><p>process.  A downturn in economic growth or increase in </p><p>joblessness - precisely the kind of short-term pain that </p><p>reforms often produce - could leave GSL vulnerable to attack </p><p>from a leftist/socialist party that can sway large numbers of </p><p>voters. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U) GSL is right to be wary of moving too fast, but at </p><p>the same time it cannot let another year slip by without </p><p>taking steps to improve the investment climate.  Your visit, </p><p>and the longer-term TIFA process, can give GSL the </p><p>encouragement it needs to enact reforms decisively.  Once the </p><p>peace process is on solid footing, any delay in these reforms </p><p>could endanger the prospects for foreign investment, and </p><p>economic growth, for the rest of the decade. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>Pursuing Common WTO Goals </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>12.  (U) Sri Lanka ought to play a bigger role - and a </p><p>constructive one - in WTO fora than it has in recent years. </p><p>(Note:  It was a virtual non-participant at Doha last year; </p><p>consumed with internal politics, it did not send a </p><p>Ministerial representative and made do instead with a few </p><p>delegates from its local Embassy.  End Note.)  As a </p><p>trade-dependent nation it has much to gain from faster </p><p>elimination of trade barriers worldwide.  You can expect </p><p>enthusiastic cooperation from GSL on the Doha Development </p><p>Agenda. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (SBU) I cannot promise, however, that Sri Lanka will be </p><p>able to execute on a par with its enthusiasm.  Frankly, Sri </p><p>Lanka will need our help if it is to help us in the WTO. </p><p>That is why I was happy to see your agenda for the TIC </p><p>included WTO capacity building programs.  I am confident that </p><p>a U.S. investment in Sri Lanka\'s WTO capacity will pay off in </p><p>the form of an enthusiastic (and increasingly capable) </p><p>partner on trade issues. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>South Asia:  The Bigger Picture </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  (U) With just 19 million of South Asia\'s 1.3 billion </p><p>people, Sri Lanka would seem at first glance to form a small </p><p>part of our overall trade interests with the subcontinent. </p><p>But Sri Lanka is capable of playing a catalytic role in </p><p>opening the region up to U.S. exports, and we can use the </p><p>TIFA process to help it assume this role. </p><p> </p><p>15.  (U) First, Sri Lanka can serve as an attractive entry </p><p>point into South Asia for U.S. companies.  Sri Lanka has an </p><p>FTA in place with India, is currently finalizing one with </p><p>Pakistan and plans to negotiate one with Bangladesh.  These </p><p>agreements are admittedly far from "free," being plagued by </p><p>negative lists and restrictions on both sides.  Yet they have </p><p>the potential to make Sri Lanka into a hub for South Asian </p><p>trade.  The Indo-Lankan FTA, for example, would allow U.S. </p><p>businesses to export products to Sri Lanka and re-export them </p><p>(with local value-addition) to India on preferential duty </p><p>terms.  With import duties into Sri Lanka low and still high </p><p>in other South Asian nations, these agreements mean Sri Lanka </p><p>can act as an attractive gateway to a largely closed South </p><p>Asian market. </p><p> </p><p>16.  (U) Second, Sri Lanka has the potential to act as a model </p><p>for economic reform and open markets in the rest of South </p><p>Asia.  For 25 years Sri Lanka has been the region\'s most open </p><p>economy.  Now, especially if it is freed of the ethnic </p><p>conflict that has hobbled growth, Sri Lanka can quickly </p><p>become a force for liberalization in the region.  We have </p><p>seen in East Asia how small, dynamic economies such as Hong </p><p>Kong and Singapore have prodded their larger neighbors toward </p><p>greater economic openness.  South Asia lacks a Hong Kong or </p><p>Singapore; Sri Lanka can play that role.  We can use the TIFA </p><p>process to help it do so. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>Conclusion:  Toward an FTA </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>17.  (SBU) You are well aware that Sri Lanka is eager to enter </p><p>into FTA negotiations with the U.S.  I believe there is </p><p>considerable merit in the idea of a U.S.-Sri Lankan FTA, </p><p>especially if it includes a rule of origin on apparel exports </p><p>requiring Sri Lankan apparel to use U.S. inputs in order to </p><p>qualify for duty free treatment.  Sri Lanka has no domestic </p><p>textile industry to speak of and currently imports about $1 </p><p>billion in fabric a year, nearly all of it from Asia.  Under </p><p>an FTA, the duty break on the finished garment would more </p><p>than compensate for the higher cost of U.S. fabric, creating </p><p>an economic incentive for Sri Lankan apparel producers to use </p><p>U.S. material.  An FTA with Sri Lanka could therefore mean </p><p>big business for the U.S. textile industry. </p><p> </p><p>18.  (SBU) I see the TIFA process as an opportunity for Sri </p><p>Lanka to prove it is ready for an FTA with us.  To do so, GSL </p><p>will need to boost U.S. exports (particularly where it is the </p><p>customer), improve the local investment climate and work with </p><p>us productively in the WTO.  If GSL shows real progress on </p><p>these fronts during the coming year, I believe it would serve </p><p>our regional trade interests well to consider an FTA with Sri </p><p>Lanka. </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
