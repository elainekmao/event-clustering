<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 004539 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/17/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: PARLIAMENTARY QUOTA EXPOSES DIVISIONS AMONG </p><p>JORDANIAN WOMEN </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. AMMAN 4423 B. AMMAN 1191 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: CDA DAVID HALE FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) One of the unforeseen aspects of the new women\'s quota </p><p>in Parliament is that it has exposed cultural cleavages and </p><p>the differing agendas between women who live in urban areas </p><p>and women who live in tribal-based areas.  Neither group </p><p>believes the other represents their collective interests. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>AMMAN WOMEN CLAIM UNDERREPRESENTATION... </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The formula used for the women\'s quota has come under </p><p>some criticism since elections--especially from Amman-based </p><p>women who failed to win a seat under the quota.    Laila </p><p>Naffa, a women\'s rights activist, told the Jordan Times that </p><p>"the government was not serious enough when introducing the </p><p>quota because the distribution was unfair."  The quota did </p><p>yield overrepresentation for areas such as Tafileh, which at </p><p>a little over 85,000 people is the smallest urban area in </p><p>Jordan, but which garnered two of six of the women\'s seats. </p><p>One successful Tafileh female candidate won only 300 votes in </p><p>her district, but the district was small enough for her to </p><p>have a winning percentage nationwide. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Politically active women in Amman, typically more </p><p>progressive than women in tribal areas, have found it </p><p>difficult to relate to the newly-elected women </p><p>Parliamentarians.  Some  ask how women from traditional, </p><p>conservative areas are supposed to represent them.  One woman </p><p>candidate from Amman had rejected running in her tribal area; </p><p>she told Poloff she ran in Amman so her parliamentary career </p><p>could focus on "real issues" and not just on performing </p><p>"wasta" functions. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The perceived division goes both ways.  At a luncheon </p><p>for the newly-elected women Parliamentarians, one Tafileh </p><p>winner bitterly complained to the heads of two women-focused </p><p>NGOs that she had never received any support from them.  She </p><p>told Poloff that she was glad no women from Amman won: "they </p><p>are already over-represented."  She also added, "women in </p><p>Amman spend more time on their hair and make-up than anything </p><p>else." </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>...BUT ALSO HAVE THEMSELVES TO BLAME </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) While the implementation of the quota may have favored </p><p>women running in smaller, more rural districts, many </p><p>political observers have noted the lack of a coherent </p><p>political strategy and coordination between women candidates </p><p>running in Amman (many of whom competed in the same </p><p>districts, splitting the votes).  Also, criticism has been </p><p>levied that campaigns in Amman were launched too late to be </p><p>effective.  When Poloff asked Salwa Nasser, the NGO </p><p>coordinator for the Jordanian National Commission for Women, </p><p>why women candidates in Amman were unsuccessful, she claimed </p><p>that women had underestimated the influence of the tribes in </p><p>the election. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Although the quota was designed to further the women\'s </p><p>cause in Jordan, so far, it has placed women in urban and </p><p>rural areas at odds.  Each set of women--urban "liberal" and </p><p>rural "tribal"--believe the otehr group will not represent </p><p>their interest.  The suspicion and resentment each side has </p><p>shown for the other may ultimately handicap the efforts of </p><p>women here to build a constituency based on "women\'s </p><p>interests" unless the two sides can begin to identify some </p><p>common political ground.  Some women candidates, </p><p>inexperienced in politics, appear also to have misjudged the </p><p>predominant influence of tribal factors in these elections. </p><p>HALE </p><p></p></div>
