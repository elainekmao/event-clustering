<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 OTTAWA 002138 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR DRL/CRA, DRL/IRF, DRL/PHD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, KIRF, CA </p><p>SUBJECT: INTERNATIONAL RELIGIOUS FREEDOM REPORT FOR CANADA </p><p>- 2003 (REVISED) </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 194330 B. OTTAWA 01480 </p><p> </p><p>1. Sensitive but Unclassified - please protect accordingly. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) The following constitutes Ottawa\'s submission for </p><p>the 2003 International Religious Freedom Report. </p><p> </p><p>Introduction and Overview -- No changes. </p><p> </p><p>Section I:  Religious Demography </p><p> </p><p>Paragraph that begins "There is no state or dominant </p><p>religion..."  - revise as follows: </p><p> </p><p>While there is no state or dominant religion, an estimated </p><p>74.6 percent of the Canadian population belongs to Christian </p><p>denominations or claims Christianity as their religion. Roman </p><p>Catholics (43 percent of the population) constitute the </p><p>largest single religious denomination, followed by Protestant </p><p>denominations (29 percent). United Church, Anglican, </p><p>Presbyterian, Lutheran, Baptist, and Pentecostal are the </p><p>largest Protestant denominations in Canada. 1.1 percent of </p><p>the Canadian population is Jewish.  According to a recent </p><p>government census, the percentage of the population who are </p><p>members of the Muslim faith has increased to 2 percent of the </p><p>population; the number of Muslims in Canada has doubled in </p><p>the 10-year period since the last census. Other religious </p><p>groups in Canada include Buddhists (approximately 1 percent </p><p>of the population); Hindus (1 percent); and Sikhs (1 </p><p>percent). The number of persons professing other religions, </p><p>such as Scientology, Baha\'i, Shinto, Taoism, aboriginal </p><p>spirituality, and pagan religions, constitutes 0.2 percent of </p><p>the population. The census also reflected that the percentage </p><p>of Canadians claiming no religious affiliation is 16 percent </p><p>of the total population, an increase from 12 percent in the </p><p>last census. </p><p> </p><p>A 2002 poll on religious attitudes by the Pew Research Center </p><p>indicated that approximately 21 percent of Canadians attend </p><p>church on a weekly basis. 30 percent of Canadians, according </p><p>to the survey, said that religion is very important to them. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Section II: Status of Religious Freedom </p><p> </p><p>Add the following as paragraph 2 (new):  Some religious </p><p>holidays are national holidays, specifically, Christmas Day, </p><p>Good Friday, and Easter Monday. These holidays do not have a </p><p>negative impact on any religious group. </p><p> </p><p>Paragraph 3 that begins, "The Constitution and..." -- this is </p><p>now paragraph 4 and should be revised as follows: </p><p> </p><p>The Constitution of Canada and the Charter of Rights and </p><p>Freedoms protect the rights or privileges possessed by </p><p>denominational schools at the time of national union in 1867. </p><p> In practice this protection has meant that some provinces </p><p>have funded and continue to fund Catholic school education, </p><p>and some provinces (such as Quebec) have funded some </p><p>Protestant education.  In recent years, the Quebec provincial </p><p>government took steps to abolish Catholic and Protestant </p><p>status for public schools; public schools in Quebec are no </p><p>longer faith-based and are open to all. And, the Ontario </p><p>provincial government, which previously had allowed tax </p><p>credits only for tuition paid to Roman Catholic private </p><p>schools, began allowing tax credits for tuition paid to all </p><p>private schools, provided such schools satisfy certain </p><p>educational standards. </p><p> </p><p>There is no official government council for interfaith </p><p>dialogue, but the government of Canada provides funding for </p><p>individual ecumenical projects on a case-by-case basis. </p><p> </p><p>Restrictions on Religious Freedom </p><p> </p><p>Government policy and practice contributed to the generally </p><p>free practice of religion. </p><p> </p><p>Remainder of paragraph beginning "(H)owever, in May 2001...", </p><p>and paragraph beginning "(I)n July 2001..." - delete. </p><p>Replace with the following: </p><p> </p><p>The Supreme Court of Canada recently agreed to hear cases </p><p>brought by groups in Quebec that claim their religious rights </p><p>have been unduly restricted by condominium contracts, and </p><p>municipal bylaws. One case involves a group of Orthodox </p><p>Jewish families living in a Montreal condominium complex, who </p><p>were barred by the condominium association from constructing </p><p>temporary huts on their balconies to celebrate the fall </p><p>festival of Sukkot. The second case involves a group of </p><p>Jehovah\'s Witnesses who are seeking the rezoning of a tract </p><p>of land they own, so that a church hall can be built on the </p><p>land. The municipality where the land is located refused to </p><p>rezone the land, because the land would no longer be subject </p><p>to property taxes if a place of worship was built on it. </p><p>A standing committee on justice and human rights organized by </p><p>the Parliament of Canada is currently conducting public </p><p>hearings around Canada on the issue of whether homosexual </p><p>couples have the right to marry.  The hearings were organized </p><p>after an Ontario court ruled that the legal definition of </p><p>marriage as a union of one man and one woman violated the </p><p>equality rights of homosexuals. Some of the hearings have </p><p>resulted in spirited debates between gay rights advocates and </p><p>representatives of religious faiths, who assert that marriage </p><p>is a religious and not a political matter, and that religious </p><p>denominations should not be forced into ordaining same-sex </p><p>marriages. The committee is expected to bring its </p><p>recommendations on the issue to Parliament later this year. </p><p> </p><p>There were no reports of religious prisoners or detainees. </p><p> </p><p>Forced Religious Conversion </p><p> </p><p>No changes to this paragraph. </p><p> </p><p>Improved and Positive Developments in Respect for Religious </p><p>Freedom. </p><p> </p><p>Delete sentence beginning "In September 2001..." </p><p> </p><p>Section III.  Societal Attitudes </p><p> </p><p>The generally amicable relationship among the religions in </p><p>society contributes to religious freedom in Canada.  (After </p><p>this sentence, delete remainder of first paragraph, and the </p><p>second, third and fourth paragraphs of this section.  Replace </p><p>with the following:) </p><p> </p><p>However, the number of anti-Semitic incidents in Canada </p><p>increased again during this period, and there are continuing </p><p>expressions of anti-Muslim feeling as well. There appeared to </p><p>be a correlation between this increase, and the continuing </p><p>violence in the Middle East. </p><p> </p><p>The B\'nai Brith Canada League for Human Rights received 459 </p><p>reports of anti-Semitic incidents in 2002, an increase of 173 </p><p>incidents from 2001. Incidents included general harassment of </p><p>Jews (282 or 61 percent of the reported incidents), vandalism </p><p>of property (148 or 32 percent), and violence (29 or 6 </p><p>percent). In an incident in Montreal on September 9, 2002, </p><p>pro-Palestinian demonstrators assaulted a number of Jews </p><p>during a riot on the Concordia University campus, where </p><p>former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was </p><p>scheduled to give a speech.  In Toronto, there was </p><p>controversy following the July 2002 murder of an orthodox </p><p>Jew. The accused murderer was a young skinhead, and many </p><p>members of the Jewish community believed the victim had been </p><p>killed because of his religion, thus making the murder a hate </p><p>crime. </p><p> </p><p>Expressions of anti-Muslim sentiment continued in Canada </p><p>during this period, according to the Canadian chapter of </p><p>CAIR. The build-up to the war in Iraq stirred up some </p><p>anti-Muslim feeling, but also resulted in some expressions of </p><p>compassion toward Muslims. The main forms of prejudice </p><p>experienced by Muslims were verbal abuse, religious or ethnic </p><p>profiling, and discrimination in the workplace. Mixed </p><p>feelings arose when a Christian evangelical group sent </p><p>humanitarian aid to Iraq. Some Muslims believe the government </p><p>of Canada is indifferent to anti-Muslim attitudes and </p><p>discrimination. </p><p> </p><p>In November 2002, an information center in Quebec run by the </p><p>Raelian religion was vandalized. Damage to the center, known </p><p>as "UFO Land," amounted to more than C$100,000. The Raelian </p><p>Church of Canada is an officially recognized religion in </p><p>Quebec. The religion, which is based on the idea that </p><p>extraterrestrials created humanity as part of a lab </p><p>experiment, had recently targeted Quebec high schools as part </p><p>of its ongoing campaign to persuade Roman Catholics to </p><p>renounce their faith. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Section IV.  U.S. Government Policy. </p><p> </p><p>The U.S. Government discusses religious freedom issues with </p><p>the Government of Canada in the context of its overall </p><p>dialogue and policy of promoting human rights. </p><p> </p><p>Add the following:  There are no persons imprisoned or </p><p>detained in Canada as a result of  their religious beliefs. </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
