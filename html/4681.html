<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 003296 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/10/2012 </p><p>TAGS: SOCI, KISL, PGOV, PINS, PINR, KPAO, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA:  PROTESTS AND PRAYERS IN KATSINA </p><p> </p><p>REF: TD-314/32127-02 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by DCM Timothy D. Andrews.  Reason 1.5 (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  Peaceful protests have been taking place recently </p><p>in Nigeria\'s northern Katsina state, reportedly sponsored </p><p>by the "Shi\'ite" Muslim Brotherhood, among others.  Taking </p><p>place before and after Friday\'s Juma\'at prayers, the number </p><p>of protests increased during the Holy month of Ramadan. </p><p>According to press reports, some of the signs carried by </p><p>protesters include "Death to America," "Death to Israel," </p><p>and "No to America\'s Middle East Policy."  One protestor </p><p>told a national newspaper that the aim of the protests was </p><p>to convince the GON to change its foreign policy towards </p><p>the U.S. and the U.K. because they are "enemies of Islam" </p><p>and against Nigeria\'s putative Muslim majority. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  A Sunni group, Izalatu Bid\'a wa Ikamatus Sunna </p><p>(Izala), has also been sponsoring prayers in mosques </p><p>throughout the state.  Anti-American diatribes were </p><p>reportedly strongest at the Kofar Kaura Juma\'at Mosque, </p><p>where the "wrath of God" was invoked against America and </p><p>its allies, notably Israel, Britain and Russia. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  Press reports identified the following clerics </p><p>with the prayers and protests: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>- Chief Imam Sheikh Muhammed Sani Kerau </p><p>- Sheikh Yakubu Musa </p><p>- Ustaz Abdullah Yusuf Filin Samji </p><p>- Ustaz Khalid Yunus </p><p>- Ustaz Abdul Basir Unguwar Kawo Kankara. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) NOTE:  Izala is a Wahabbi-influenced movement </p><p>founded in 1978 by the late Sheikh Abubakar Mahmud Gumi. </p><p>It has a large presence in major northern population </p><p>centers. The Izala use modern teaching methods to impart </p><p>traditional, essentially conservative, religious precepts. </p><p>Izala has become more activist in recent years; its members </p><p>were key players in the successful drive to establish </p><p>Sharia-based criminal codes in a dozen northern states. </p><p>On the other hand, Nigeria\'s Muslim Brothers are commonly </p><p>called "Shi\'ites" because of their leader, Ibrahim el- </p><p>Zakzaky\'s longstanding ties to Iran.  The Muslim Brothers </p><p>have a long tradition of political activism (e.g., protest </p><p>marches).  END NOTE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  COMMENT:  For more information on Sheikh Musa, see </p><p>reftel.  The continuing violence in the Palestinian </p><p>territories fuels the erroneous but nearly universal </p><p>perception that the USG is entirely unsympathetic to the </p><p>Palestinian desires for self-determination and an end to </p><p>Israeli occupation.   Because of this, hardline Islamic </p><p>leaders find a fertile field in northern Nigeria to sow the </p><p>seeds of anti-American sentiment.  Additional Mission </p><p>reporting on Northern views of the U.S., including a </p><p>response to State 251043, is being prepared. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
