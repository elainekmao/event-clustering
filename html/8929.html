<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ZAGREB 001439 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/23/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, HR, Defense Reform (Mil & NATO) </p><p>SUBJECT: HDZ CONVENTION: EX-CONGRESSMAN SUGGESTS U.S. </p><p>SUPPORT FOR HDZ </p><p> </p><p>REF: ZAGREB 1230 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: NICHOLAS HILL, POLECON COUNSELOR, FOR REASONS: 1.5 (B) A </p><p>ND (D). </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>    ------- </p><p> </p><p>1.   (C) IVO SANADER IS PULLING OUT THE STOPS TO PRESENT HIS </p><p>PARTY AS PRO-WEST AND RESPECTABLE.  HDZ\'S ANNUAL CONVENTION </p><p>TOOK PLACE JUNE 21, AN EVENT SOME EXPECTED TO BE A YAWNER </p><p>SINCE NO PARTY SEATS WERE UP FOR ELECTION.  HDZ PRESENTED </p><p>EX-U.S. CONGRESSMAN GUY VANDER JAGT AS THE CONVENTION\'S </p><p>KEYNOTE SPEAKER.  TO THUNDEROUS APPLAUSE, VANDER JAGT CLAIMED </p><p>THAT IVO SANADER HAD THE ENDORSEMENT OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, </p><p>IN PARTICULAR, VICE PRESIDENT CHENEY AND SECRETARY RUMSFELD. </p><p>FOR HIS PART, SANADER\'S SPEECH WAS MODERATE IN TONE.  IN </p><p>REMARKS AFTER THE CONVENTION, HE DEFLECTED QUESTIONS ABOUT </p><p>INDICTED WAR CRIMINAL ANTE GOTOVINA.  ACCORDING TO HDZ </p><p>OFFICIALS, TURNOUT AT THE CONVENTION WAS ALMOST 6,000, MUCH </p><p>LARGER THAN LAST YEAR\'S.  SANADER LOOKS TO HAVE CONSOLIDATED </p><p>HIS HOLD ON TUDJMAN\'S OLD PARTY.  THE EMBASSY ISSUED A </p><p>STATEMENT AFTER THE CONVENTION EXPLAINING THAT THE U.S. </p><p>GOVERNMENT DOES NOT ENDORSE ANY CANDIDATES.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>U.S. SUPPORTS THE HDZ? </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) KEEN TO SHOW THAT HDZ IS REFORMING AND HAS </p><p>CREDIBILITY IN THE WEST, PARTY PRESIDENT IVO SANADER ASKED </p><p>GUY VANDER JAGT, FORMER REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN FROM MICHIGAN, </p><p>TO DELIVER THE KEYNOTE ADDRESS.  VANDER JAGT -- WHO DELIVERED </p><p>THE NOMINATING SPEECH AT THE REPUBLICAN CONVENTION FOR RONALD </p><p>REAGAN IN 1980 -- TOLD THE THRONG AT ZAGREB\'S CIBONA </p><p>BASKETBALL ARENA THAT MUCH OF WASHINGTON\'S REPUBLICAN </p><p>ESTABLISHMENT WAS BEHIND HDZ.  HE ASSERTED THAT THE </p><p>REPUBLICANS APPRECIATED IN PARTICULAR HDZ\'S SUPPORT ON IRAQ. </p><p>    VANDER JAGT CLAIMED IN HIS SPEECH THAT HE HAD SPOKEN TO </p><p>SECRETARY OF DEFENSE RUMSFELD AND VICE PRESIDENT CHENEY JUST </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>BEFORE DEPARTING FOR CROATIA.  THE DEFENSE SECRETARY, </p><p>ACCORDING TO VANDER JAGT, TOLD HIM TO DO A GOOD JOB TO HELP </p><p>THE HDZ.  RUMSFELD, HE CLAIMED, EXPRESSED APPRECIATION FOR </p><p>SANADER\'S SUPPORT ON IRAQ.  REFERRING TO SANADER AS CROATIA\'S </p><p>NEXT PRIME MINISTER, VANDER JAGT CALLED ON HDZ TO SWEEP THE </p><p>CURRENT GOVERNMENT OUT OF OFFICE -- AND, IN SO DOING, HE </p><p>PRESSED ALL THE HOT ECONOMIC AND NATIONALIST BUTTONS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) VANDER JAGT WAS AMONG SEVERAL INTERNATIONAL VIPS </p><p>INVITED.  HE WAS NOT INTRODUCED AS A "FORMER" CONGRESSMAN; </p><p>THE CLEAR AIM WAS TO CREATE THE IMPRESSION THAT THE U.S. </p><p>ADMINISTRATION ENDORSES HDZ AND WANTS TO GET THE CURRENT </p><p>GOVERNMENT OUT OF OFFICE.  THE EX-CONGRESSMAN\'S APPEARANCE </p><p>WAS ARRANGED BY FORMER CROATIAN AMBASSADOR TO THE U.S. MIOMIR </p><p>ZUZUL.  IN CONTRAST TO VANDER JAGT AND SEVERAL OTHER EUROPEAN </p><p>SPEAKERS, DORIS PACK, PRESIDENT OF THE EU PARLIAMENT\'S </p><p>COMMISSION FOR SOUTHEAST EUROPE, DELIVERED WHAT WAS LESS OF A </p><p>PEP TALK.  SHE WAS SUBSTANTIVE AND CONVEYED THE FAMILIAR </p><p>THEMES ABOUT CROATIA\'S INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS.  WHEN SHE </p><p>SAID SHE HOPED INDICTED WAR CRIMINAL ANTE GOTOVINA WOULD GO </p><p>TO THE HAGUE, THE AUDIENCE HISSED LOUDLY.  (SANADER DID NOT </p><p>TOUCH ON GOTOVINA IN HIS PREPARED REMARKS, BUT WHEN ASKED </p><p>ABOUT IT IN A SUBSEQUENT HTV INTERVIEW, HE DISSEMBLED: "IN </p><p>OPPOSITION," HE DID NOT HAVE ALL THE INFORMATION NEEDED TO </p><p>MAKE AN INFORMED JUDGMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>SPIN CONTROL </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>    4.  (C) WE PREPARED PRESS GUIDANCE TO GET OUT THE MESSAGE </p><p>THAT VANDER JAGT\'S VIEWS DID NOT REPRESENT THOSE OF THE USG. </p><p>THE CROATIAN PRESS\'S TRACK RECORD OF FACT CHECKING IS NOT </p><p>GREAT, AND WE WANTED TO BE SURE PEOPLE KNEW VANDER JAGT IS </p><p>NOT CURRENTLY A MEMBER OF CONGRESS.  IN ADDITION, WE REACHED </p><p>OUT TO KEY ADVISORS OF PM RACAN AND PQSIDENT MESIC TO MAKE </p><p>SURE THEY GOT THE WORD.  BOTH ARE FAMOUS FOR LEADING WITH </p><p>THEIR CHINS WHERE THE PRESS IS CONCERNED, AND WE DID NOT WANT </p><p>TO SEE THEM COMMENTING ON REMARKS BY VANDER JAGT, THE FULL </p><p>BACKGROUND OF WHICH THEY DID NOT HAVE. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) FOR HIS PART, SANADER HAS COME A LONG WAY SINCE HE </p><p>DEFEATED HARD LINER IVIC PASALIC IN A HOTLY CONTESTED </p><p>LEADERSHIP STRUGGLE A YEAR AGO.  HE HAS CONSOLIDATED HIS BASE </p><p>AND JETTISONED A NUMBER OF THE MORE PROBLEMATIC FIGURES FROM </p><p>POSITIONS OF AUTHORITY IN THE PARTY.  INDEED, HE KICKED A </p><p>PROMINENT HDZ RIGHT-WINGER, LJUBO CESIC-ROJS, OUT OF THE </p><p>PARTY.  AS ONE COMMENTARY PUT IT AFTER THE CONVENTION, </p><p>HOWEVER, SANADER STILL HAS A LONG WAY TO GO TO CONVINCE </p><p>CROATIAN VOTERS -- AS DISTINCT FROM HDZ ACTIVISTS -- THAT HIS </p><p>PARTY ENJOYS INTERNATIONAL RESPECTABILITY.  AND IF THE PARTY </p><p> </p><p>ZAGREB 00001439  002 OF 002 </p><p> </p><p>RTNERS, THE DEMOCRATIC </p><p>CENTER (DC) AND THE CROATIAN LIBERAL PARTY (HSLS) SENT SECOND </p><p>TIER REPRESENTATIVES.  THE PEASANTS PARTY (HSS), THE SECOND </p><p>BIGGEST IN THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT -- AND THE WIDELY-REPUTED </p><p>"KINGMAKER-TO-BE" -- SENT NOBODY.  HSS HAD BEEN RUMORED FOR </p><p>    MONTHS TO HAVE BEEN FLIRTING WITH HDZ. </p><p>ROSSIN </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p></p></div>
