<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 002783 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/S, AF/PD, DS/OP/AF </p><p> </p><p>PRETORIA AND JOHANNESBURG FOR EMBOFF </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ASEC, PREL, KPAO, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: AMERICAN JOURNALISTS ACCOSTED BY ANGRY RULING </p><p>PARTY SUPPORTERS </p><p> </p><p>  1.     Summary:  On December 7 two journalists, </p><p>     including an Amcit and a South African citizen, were </p><p>     surrounded, detained and lightly roughed up by a group </p><p>     of about 30 ZANU-PF supporters.   The incident </p><p>     occurred at a shopping center in Harare\'s upper-middle </p><p>     class Newlands neighborhood as the journalists were </p><p>     interviewing and photographing people waiting in line </p><p>     for bread at a retail bakery.  At Emboff\'s urging, </p><p>     members of the Zimbabwean Republic Police (ZRP) took </p><p>     the journalists to a nearby police station.  In a 30- </p><p>     minute session at the police station, the officer in </p><p>     charge refused demands by the ruling party supporters </p><p>     to arrest the journalists and seize their cameras. </p><p>     The officer in charge took names and contact details </p><p>     of the journalists and Emboff, stated that the ZRP </p><p>     would investigate the incident, and released the </p><p>     journalists.  This incident illustrates growing </p><p>     tensions in Zimbabwe, the potential for confrontations </p><p>     provoked by ruling party supporters even in urban </p><p>     areas, and the relatively low "flashpoint" for such </p><p>     incidents in Zimbabwe today.   End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>  2.   Saturday morning, December 7, an Amcit journalist and </p><p>     a South African photojournalist (they have asked not to be </p><p>     named) were interviewing and taking photographs of </p><p>     Zimbabweans waiting in line to buy bread at a retail bakery </p><p>     in the Newlands shopping center in an upper middle class </p><p>     Harare suburb.  Neither the people in the bread line nor a </p><p>     passing police officer expressed any objection to the </p><p>     journalists\' presence.  The journalists were accredited by </p><p>     the Government of Zimbabwe (having paid the US$100 </p><p>     application and US$500 registration fees) and were carrying </p><p>     the GoZ-issued media accreditation documents that give them </p><p>     permission to be in Zimbabwe until January 5, 2003. </p><p> </p><p>  3.   Within a few minutes of their arrival at the bread </p><p>     line, a hostile, roughly 30-year old man, who apparently </p><p>     believed he had the right to make a "citizen\'s arrest," </p><p>     accosted the two journalists.  He attempted to relieve the </p><p>     photographer of his cameras, claiming that the journalists </p><p>     were violating citizens\' right to privacy, were violating </p><p>     Zimbabwean sovereignty, and were intending to damage </p><p>     Zimbabwe by publishing photographs and articles that would </p><p>     "make it appear that there are problems here."  Within a </p><p>     few minutes a crowd of about 30 hostile young men </p><p>     surrounded the two journalists.   Angrily shouted comments </p><p>     from the crowd indicated its adherence to government </p><p>     opinions about the western media\'s role in helping to </p><p>     create Zimbabwe\'s current difficulties.  The journalists </p><p>     were pushed and shoved, some in the crowd attempted to </p><p>     steal the photographer\'s cameras, and the photographer was </p><p>     slapped on the head and shoulders two or three times. </p><p>     There were no injuries. </p><p> </p><p>  4.   The group of young men wanted to take the reporters </p><p>     into an empty field near the shopping center, saying that </p><p>     they were going to a police station.  The reporters held </p><p>     their ground, and were able to call Emboff and Zimbabwe </p><p>     Republic Police (ZRP).  Emboff informed the RSO of the </p><p>     incident in progress and then drove to the shopping center, </p><p>     about 5 minutes from his residence.  Emboff arrived at the </p><p>     shopping center shortly after the ZRP and found the two </p><p>     journalists, now joined by another Amcit journalist (also </p><p>     properly accredited), standing next to a police vehicle and </p><p>     surrounded by approximately 30 agitated young men.  The </p><p>     incident had become something of a spectacle and was </p><p>     attracting a larger crowd.  Emboff spoke with the police </p><p>     officer in charge of the vehicle and urged that he defuse </p><p>     the situation by taking the journalists to the nearest </p><p>     police station.  The ZRP officer agreed and Emboff said he </p><p>     would follow in his own car.  Two of the journalists and </p><p>     three of the "complainants" traveled to the police station </p><p>     in the ZRP vehicle.  Emboff and the third journalist </p><p>     followed. </p><p> </p><p>  5.   The group went to the nearby Tomlinson Depot police </p><p>     station and was shown into the office of Superintendent J. </p><p>     Chani, Officer in Command of the Diplomatic Protection </p><p>     Unit.  Superintendent Chani listened to both sides of the </p><p>     story, including a great deal of bluster and bad </p><p>     information from the "complainants," and stated he could </p><p>     not see that any crime had been committed.  To mollify the </p><p>     "complainants," he took the names and contact details of </p><p>     the 3 journalists and the Emboff, said that he would </p><p>     investigate the incident and that if there were any charges </p><p>     to be filed, he would be able to contact the journalists </p><p>     through the Emboff.  The journalists and Emboff spent about </p><p>     30 minutes at the police station, most of that time </p><p>     dedicated to the xenophobic diatribes of the </p><p>     "complainants."  These people either truly believed, or </p><p>     were paid to believe, Government of Zimbabwe propaganda </p><p>     about a western conspiracy to damage Zimbabwe.  Even though </p><p>     the "complainants" remained angry and wanted the ZRP to </p><p>     seize the cameras as "evidence," Superintendent Chani gave </p><p>     Emboff permission to depart with the journalists. </p><p> </p><p>  6.   Comment:  Although this incident pales in comparison </p><p>     to the sort of mob rule experienced by thousands of </p><p>     Zimbabweans since February 2000, it is noteworthy that this </p><p>     is the first time that international journalists have </p><p>     seriously been threatened by ruling party supporters in </p><p>     Harare.  Up until this incident, international journalists </p><p>     were aware of the dangers of vigilantism in rural areas but </p><p>     believed that they could work freely in Harare.  We believe </p><p>     this incident demonstrates a rising level of desperation </p><p>     and anger among unemployed young men.  It also shows how </p><p>     easily these frustrations can be converted into ruling </p><p>     party-tinged hostility against outsiders, especially </p><p>     foreign journalists. </p><p> </p><p>  7.   Comment continued: The journalists involved in this </p><p>     incident do not want the USG to make an issue of it.  They </p><p>     are concerned that raising the profile of the incident </p><p>     could make it even more difficult, if not impossible, for </p><p>     them to work in Zimbabwe.  Given the extraordinary </p><p>     difficulty of getting permission to work here, they prefer </p><p>     not to risk expulsion or banishment.   The reporters do, </p><p>     however, agree that the incident marks an escalation of the </p><p>     level of tension in Zimbabwe and a departure from the </p><p>     relative freedom international journalists have had to work </p><p>     in Harare and other major urban areas.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p>WHITEHEAD </p><p></p></div>
