<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ANKARA 003974 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EUR/SE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/19/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: SIXTH EU-RELATED REFORM PACKAGE IN PARLIAMENT, </p><p>SEVENTH IN THE WORKS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ANKARA 2909 </p><p>     B. ANKARA 3410 </p><p>     C. ANKARA 3618 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Polcouns John Kunstadter; Reasons 1.5(b) and </p><p>(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: With the Turkish Parliament beginning its </p><p>consideration of the GOT\'s sixth EU-related reform package in </p><p>the past two years, the ruling AK Party has moved forward </p><p>despite an attempt by the military-dominated National </p><p>Security Council (NSC) to delay the legislation and the </p><p>outspoken opposition of military leaders to elements of the </p><p>package.  The GOT plans to pass a seventh reform package, </p><p>aimed at reducing the political influence of the military, </p><p>and may adopt an "amnesty" for PKK terrorists before </p><p>Parliament goes into recess.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>Committee Approves Controversial Reforms </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) The full Parliament June 19 began to review the sixth </p><p>EU-related reform package following the Justice Committee\'s </p><p>unanimous decision to approve it with no significant changes. </p><p> The Committee left intact controversial measures relating to </p><p>anti-terror legislation, Kurdish language rights, and </p><p>international election observers that had been opposed by </p><p>leading elements of the military (reftels).  The lone </p><p>concession to the military was the removal of an article that </p><p>would have allowed the establishment of places of worship in </p><p>apartments (Note: A separate amendment reported reftel (A) </p><p>removing an obstacle to the construction of free-standing </p><p>non-Muslim places of worship was left intact.  End Note). </p><p>The package is part of a series of reforms the GOT plans to </p><p>adopt before the parliamentary recess, which is scheduled to </p><p>begin July 1 but could be postponed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The AK Party moved forward with the package despite an </p><p>attempt by the military-dominated NSC to delay the process by </p><p>deciding at its May 28 meeting to continue discussion of the </p><p>package at its next meeting, June 26 (reftel C).  Mehmet </p><p>Elkatmis, chairman of the parliamentary Human Rights </p><p>Committee, called this move "a victory not for AK, but for </p><p>the country," and predicted to us that the full Parliament </p><p>would quickly pass the package with no significant changes, a </p><p>view echoed by other contacts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>New Definition of Terrorism </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) All of the measures described reftel A remain in the </p><p>package.  These include the revocation of Article 8 of the </p><p>Anti-Terror Law, which outlaws written and oral communication </p><p>"aiming at damaging the indivisible unity of the State." </p><p>Some GOT officials have reportedly argued that the "vacuum" </p><p>created by the abolition of Article 8 should be filled by </p><p>expanding other speech-related laws, such as Article 312 of </p><p>the Penal Code, or enforcing them more aggressively.  In </p><p>addition to abolishing Article 8, the package also narrows </p><p>the legal definition of terrorism.  Under the new definition, </p><p>an act must be carried out through the use of "force" or </p><p>"violence" to be considered terrorism; under current law, </p><p>acts involving "intimidation" or "threats" could also qualify </p><p>as terrorism.  (Note: Turkey has been widely criticized for </p><p>charging people with terrorism for controversial speech, </p><p>often involving comments promoting a Kurdish identity or </p><p>criticizing the State.  End Note). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>Private Kurdish Broadcasts </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) The package would also allow private radio and TV </p><p>outlets to broadcast in Kurdish and other traditional </p><p>non-Turkish languages.  Previous reforms allowing Kurdish </p><p>language broadcasts were followed by restrictive implementing </p><p>legislation limiting such broadcasts to the state-owned TRT </p><p>media company, as well as placing strict time limits.  TRT </p><p>has not produced any such broadcasts, and recently lodged a </p><p>legal challenge to the regulation directing it to do so. </p><p>This latest amendment is an attempt to break the logjam by </p><p>opening up non-Turkish broadcasts to the private sector. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>Seventh Package To Reduce Military\'s Influence </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Meanwhile, the GOT is working on a seventh package, </p><p>which PM Erdogan has vowed Parliament will pass before going </p><p>into recess, even if that means extending the session until </p><p>August.  Our contacts say the seventh package is still in </p><p>draft form and under review in the Justice Ministry, and </p><p>therefore there is no firm information on the details. </p><p>However, a number of contacts -- including Elkatmis; Seref </p><p>Iba, deputy director of the parliamentary Legislative </p><p>Department; and Murat Yetkin, Radikal newspaper columnist -- </p><p>confirmed reports that the seventh package will challenge the </p><p>political influence and independence of the military more </p><p>directly than any of the previous legal reforms.  The </p><p>legislation may be changed significantly before it is </p><p>introduced in Parliament, but our contacts said recent press </p><p>reports on the package, though vague, accurately reflect the </p><p>draft in its current form.  Reported elements of the package </p><p>include: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Parliamentary discussion of the Defense Ministry budget </p><p>will be open to the public.  The government will be given </p><p>more power over the details of the budget. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Military spending will be included in the general budget. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- The number of military representatives on the NSC will be </p><p>reduced from five to two (or one, according to one report), </p><p>and force commanders will not serve on the NSC. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- The provision stating that the NSC Secretary General must </p><p>be a general will be revoked, opening the position up to </p><p>civilians and lower-ranking officers. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- The Jandarma -- under joint military and Interior Ministry </p><p>control -- will transfer some of its law enforcement </p><p>authority in urban areas to the (civilian controlled) Turkish </p><p>National Police. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>PKK "Amnesty" Planned </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) In addition, Elkatmis said the GOT is considering </p><p>including an "amnesty" for PKK terrorists in the seventh </p><p>package.  Elkatmis and Yetkin both told us AK leaders are </p><p>discussing the details of a law that would be narrower than a </p><p>full amnesty, but broader than past "repentance laws"  (Note: </p><p>These laws were ineffective because they required PKK members </p><p>to "confess" and apologize for their actions, which very few </p><p>were willing to do. End Note).  Yetkin said the new law will </p><p>exclude only the top PKK leaders from benefits, and will </p><p>require other PKK fighters only to lay down their weapons and </p><p>forswear future violence.  Elkatmis said controversial terms </p><p>like "amnesty" and "repentance" will not be used in the law; </p><p>its title will be along the lines of "Social Peace Law." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>Transparency in Government </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Elkatmis said the GOT is also developing a </p><p>Transparency in Government Law that, he claimed, Parliament </p><p>intends to pass before going into recess.  He said the law </p><p>will grant Turkish citizens greater access to Government </p><p>information by narrowing the definition of "secret" </p><p>information.  He said the new definition of secrecy will </p><p>include only information directly related to national </p><p>security.  He said the law will also require Government </p><p>offices to be more responsive to citizens; for example, under </p><p>the law, officials will be required to perform quickly </p><p>routine transactions, such is issuing licenses, or provide a </p><p>written explanation of any delay. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Though PM Erdogan and FM Gul publicly vowed to protect </p><p>the sixth package from dilution and pass it before the June </p><p>26 NSC meeting, our AK contacts, wary of stiff military </p><p>resistance, were skeptical.  Now the advancement of the sixth </p><p>package is a victory for Erdogan and his government.  AK has </p><p>thus earned, at least for now, the right to claim it is in </p><p>control of the human rights reform/EU membership process.  As </p><p>always, however, reforms adopted by Parliament will not be </p><p>realized unless they are implemented by the bureaucracy, </p><p>which to date has consistently undermined legislation deemed </p><p>threatening to the Kemalist State.  Reducing the number of </p><p>military NSC members will not necessarily reduce the </p><p>military\'s influence over the body.  Eliminating Article 8 of </p><p>the Anti-Terror Law may, in the short run at least, mean only </p><p>that prosecutors will rely more on some of the other </p><p>authoritarian, speech-related laws still on the books. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
