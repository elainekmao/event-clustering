<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 GUATEMALA 000077 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, EAID, PGOV, MOPS, GT </p><p>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR AND MINUGUA CHIEF TOUR D\'HORIZON </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary:  The Ambassador and USAID Director met </p><p>with MINUGUA Chief Koenigs, who was thankful for USG support </p><p>on extension of MINUGUA\'s mandate through 2004, and was </p><p>cautiously optimistic about further implementation of the </p><p>Peace Accords.  The Ambassador discussed possible </p><p>counternarcotics decertification, CAFTA negotiations, and </p><p>donor collaboration in the Consultative Group.  Koenigs </p><p>described MINUGUA\'s priorities for 2003-2004, which include a </p><p>very limited electoral monitoring role, and said MINUGUA </p><p>would have little to contribute to an investigation of </p><p>clandestine groups in Guatemala.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) On January 6, Ambassador Hamilton, USAID Director </p><p>Anders and USAID Coordinator Reisman paid a courtesy call on </p><p>MINUGUA Representative Tom Koenigs, his deputy Maria </p><p>Maldonado and assistant Jens Urban.  The discussion was </p><p>wide-ranging and cordial in tone. </p><p> </p><p>Grateful for Extended Mandate </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Koenigs thanked the Ambassador warmly for USG </p><p>support for extending MINUGUA\'s mandate to the end of 2004 </p><p>and outlined MINUGUA\'s priority agenda for its remaining two </p><p>years, namely human rights, indigenous advancement, and </p><p>demilitarization.  MINUGUA\'s focus will be on </p><p>capacity-building of local institutions, and all human rights </p><p>case verifications will be conducted jointly between MINUGUA </p><p>and the Office of the Human Rights Ombudsman (PDH).  Koenigs </p><p>said he would propose to UN headquarters that all field </p><p>officers work exclusively in local capacity building in 2004. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Upbeat on Accords; Concerned About "Differences In Agenda" </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Koenigs said he was optimistic about prospects for </p><p>progress on Peace Accords implementation in the remaining </p><p>year of the Portillo Administration, despite the challenges </p><p>ahead.  Koenigs highlighted MINUGUA\'s successes and ongoing </p><p>efforts to urge the government to adhere to key elements of </p><p>the peace agenda.   He cited the importance of the </p><p>Consultative Group process and meeting in Guatemala later </p><p>this year.  The Ambassador pledged support for the donor </p><p>consensus in the CG while noting we had some doubts over the </p><p>value of a CG with an outgoing government. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Koenigs referred to a perceived "difference in </p><p>agenda" between the USG and MINUGUA, particularly in the area </p><p>of security and demilitarization.  On the security issue, </p><p>Koenigs said that although personal security is the top </p><p>concern of the majority of Guatemalans, Guatemala lacks a </p><p>"Giuliani" to help address law enforcement problems.  He was </p><p>critical of the performance of the National Civil Police </p><p>(PNC), citing "stupidity" as "half of the problem."  Koenigs </p><p>also noted that the PNC did not receive adequate resources </p><p>(and international donor support was limited) and was </p><p>consistently overshadowed by the military. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Koenigs said that MINUGUA is particularly concerned </p><p>about "remilitarization" and the growing power of the </p><p>military (he cited joint patrolling with PNC, potential role </p><p>in maritime patrols, etc.).  While claiming a good working </p><p>relationship with the military, particularly the Minister of </p><p>Defense, Koenigs nonetheless believes that civilian oversight </p><p>and control is weak at best.   Koenigs also expressed concern </p><p>that no security body be set up outside of civilian control </p><p>(Comment: perhaps alluding to Presidential candidate Oscar </p><p>Berger\'s idea to convert the Army into a "gendarmerie-like" </p><p>institution.  End Comment.).  Koenigs credited the GOG for </p><p>its announced plan to demobilize the EMP, but expressed </p><p>concern that the EMP\'s civilian presidential security </p><p>replacement (SAAS), might be vulnerable to a security </p><p>incident intended to undermine its political viability. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) The Ambassador doubted that we actually have a </p><p>difference in agenda.  He explained current restrictions on </p><p>our mil-mil relationship, i.e., regular IMET and FMF being </p><p>prohibited by law.  He said we will have a frank dialogue </p><p>with the Guatemalan military on human rights, transparency in </p><p>the military budget and on the need for the military to be </p><p>apolitical.  Thus, the Ambassador said, we see no difference </p><p>in agenda. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) Koenigs asked the Ambassador how USG narcotics </p><p>decertification would affect the GOG.  The Ambassador </p><p>explained the possibility of a national interest waiver and </p><p>said we will seek GOG participation in a Central Amercian </p><p>Free Trade Agreement regardless.   The Ambassador told </p><p>Koenigs that while there was obvious tension in our bilateral </p><p>relationship due to our concerns over corruption and </p><p>narco-trafficking, we have every intention of making progress </p><p>in these areas and in the overall bilateral relationship. </p><p> </p><p>Sees Limited MINUGUA Role in Elections Observation </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) Koenigs said that MINUGUA sees itself playing a </p><p>very limited role in elections monitoring -- since its field </p><p>presence and capacity are now so limited.  He said the OAS </p><p>and the EU (which is well advanced in planning an observer </p><p>mission) must take the lead role in elections monitoring. </p><p>(Note:  USAID is funding part of the OAS\' broader voter </p><p>outreach effort and is gathering more information on other </p><p>OAS and EU plans for election monitoring.  End Note.)  Since </p><p>Guatemala\'s last two elections have been largely free and </p><p>fair, Koenigs does not expect UN headquarters to mount an </p><p>observation mission in 2003 unless it receives a specific </p><p>request from the GOG.  Were MINUGUA asked to take a more </p><p>prominent role in elections monitoring, he said, it would </p><p>need additional resources. </p><p>9.  (SBU) When pressed about a possible Rios Montt candidacy, </p><p>Koenigs commented that he guessed it to be a "50/50" </p><p>possibility, particularly now given his hold on the Army </p><p>through his son\'s recent promotion.  Koenigs said he was </p><p>under strict orders from UN headquarters not to comment </p><p>publicly on the validity of specific candidacies, </p><p>particularly if Rios Montt were to be cleared to run by the </p><p>Constitutional Court. </p><p> </p><p>Concerned About Human Rights </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU) Koenigs lauded the Department\'s annual Human </p><p>Rights Report for Guatemala and commended the Embassy\'s </p><p>continuing concern and emphasis on human rights and </p><p>implementation of the Peace Accords.  Koenigs expressed </p><p>concern about recent extrajudicial killings and threats </p><p>against indigenous leaders.  The style of the attacks clearly </p><p>indicate involvement of individuals trained in military </p><p>techniques. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (SBU) Turning to the proposal from human rights groups </p><p>to mount a commission to investigate clandestine groups and </p><p>activities in Guatemala, Koenigs was distinctly </p><p>unenthusiastic about MINUGUA collaboration and about any such </p><p>commission\'s prospects for success.  Koenigs stated flatly </p><p>that, despite mention of the worrisome existence of </p><p>clandestine groups in its most recent report, MINUGUA does </p><p>not have specific information on clandestine groups, could </p><p>not take on the task of verifying the existence of these </p><p>groups without additional resources, and currently would not </p><p>have much to contribute to such an investigation. </p><p>Furthermore, Koenigs said that the Salvador death squad </p><p>commission being promoted as a model for this commission was </p><p>considered to have been largely ineffective by the UN. </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  (SBU) Koenigs, who has a background in Green Party </p><p>politics before working for the UN for three years in Bosnia, </p><p>seems a littled surprised but pleased to be so closely allied </p><p>with the U.S. in Guatemala, his (mis)perceptions of </p><p>"differences in agenda" notwithstanding.  This initial </p><p>meeting was useful in clarifying some of those perceptions, </p><p>and setting a cooperative tone for collaboration in the </p><p>run-up to the Consultative Group meeting.  Koenig\'s </p><p>misgivings about a commission to investigate clandestine </p><p>groups seem to stem from an understandable concern to prevent </p><p>further MINUGUA mandate-creep at a time when it is beginning </p><p>its phase-out. </p><p> </p><p>Hamilton </p><p></p></div>
