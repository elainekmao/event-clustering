<p>UNCLAS FRANKFURT 001051 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, GM </p><p>SUBJECT:  BADEN-WUERTTEMBERG MINISTER OF INTERIOR THOMAS </p><p>SCHAEUBLE CONCERNED OVER INCREASE IN VIOLENT CRIME </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary: In a meeting with the Consul General on </p><p>January 29, Baden-Wuerttemberg (B-W) Minister of Interior, </p><p>Dr. Thomas Schaeuble (CDU) expressed his regret over anti- </p><p>American statements in recent election campaigns.  On </p><p>terrorism, Schaeuble is concerned about a lack of </p><p>cooperation from the Muslim community in B-W.  The B-W </p><p>police have seen a significant increase in violent crime </p><p>committed by ethnic Germans.  Schaeuble complained about </p><p>leaks of sensitive information, which hinders closer </p><p>cooperation with foreign intelligence services.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Minister Schaeuble regretted the anti-American </p><p>rhetoric in the Social Democratic Party\'s (SPD) election </p><p>campaigns in Hesse and Lower Saxony.  He noted that there </p><p>has always been a certain amount of anti-Americanism in </p><p>Germany but that the national government should refrain from </p><p>such statements.  Cooperation in southwest between the U.S. </p><p>military and the B-W police has always been excellent, </p><p>Schauble said. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) On internal security, Schaeuble sees an "abstract </p><p>threat potential" in Germany.  Germany has a large Muslim </p><p>community and some members are criminals.  There are about </p><p>three million Muslims living in Germany, and three to four </p><p>hundred thousand in B-W.  About 50 Muslims in B-W are </p><p>considered dangerous.  According to Schaeuble, the lack of </p><p>integration of the Muslim community into the German </p><p>population creates tensions.  He described Turkish </p><p>communities as a "state within a state."  It is almost </p><p>impossible for police authorities to penetrate and observe </p><p>Muslim groups.  These communities provide excellent hiding </p><p>spaces for potential terrorists.  He also regretted that the </p><p>Muslim community has not provided any tips to police to help </p><p>find and arrest potential terrorists.  Schaeuble noted that </p><p>this reflects badly on law-abiding Muslims.  Most arrests </p><p>have come from tips from allied intelligence and law </p><p>enforcement services.  Schaeuble added that he wishes that </p><p>U.S. intelligence agencies would be more willing to share </p><p>information.  On the other hand, he admitted that frequent </p><p>leaks from German authorities to the media are not helpful. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Schaeuble also described ethnic Germans as a </p><p>problem.  Drug trafficking and the increased brutality of </p><p>crimes are his biggest concern.  However, there is no </p><p>evidence of links between ethnic Germans and the Russian </p><p>mafia. Schaeuble pointed out that similar to the Muslim </p><p>communities, ethnic Germans and young people in particular, </p><p>show limited interest in playing an active role in German </p><p>communities. </p><p> </p><p>BODDE </p><p></p></div>
