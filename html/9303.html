<p>S E C R E T SANAA 001684 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/09/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PARM, PTER, ETTC, YM, COUNTER TERRORISM </p><p>SUBJECT: WEAPONS BUYBACK REDUX </p><p> </p><p>REF: SANAA 1590 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edmund J. Hull, for Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S/NF)  Brigadier General Shater, under orders from </p><p>President Saleh, held a 7/2 viewing of ROYG proceeds from </p><p>recent weapons buyback collection efforts for the Ambassador </p><p>and other USG officials (reftel).  On July 6, Shater met with </p><p>the Ambassador to ascertain the U.S. reaction to the display </p><p>and to discuss ROYG\'s ongoing arms control strategies, </p><p>including the weapons buyback program.  Also in attendance </p><p>were DATT, PolOff (notetaker), and Ossami al-Shami from </p><p>Presidential Protocol.  (Comment:  Al-Shami\'s presence </p><p>indicates the President\'s personal oversight of this recent </p><p>exchange.  End comment.) </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S/NF)  Ambassador said that initiatives like the weapons </p><p>buyback program are extremely important because of reports </p><p>indicating that arms and munitions from Yemen were used in </p><p>the Riyadh attacks.  However, citing similar buyback </p><p>programs\' creation of secondary markets, the Ambassador </p><p>stressed that the U.S. will not attempt to purchase billions </p><p>of dollars of weapons worldwide --  but the U.S. will help </p><p>with technical assistance. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S/NF)  Ambassador reiterated the April and 7/2 offer of </p><p>assistance (reftel) in the form of a DIA team.  This team </p><p>would consist of specialists capable of helping ROYG </p><p>catalogue current stockpiles and future acquisitions.  This </p><p>data could then be incorporated into a database that would </p><p>allow both ROYG and the U.S. to ascertain the origins of </p><p>weapons purchased through the weapons buyback program, seized </p><p>at borders, or used in terrorist incidents worldwide.  (Note: </p><p> Depending upon the findings and recommendations of the DIA </p><p>Team, this may include the acquisition and installation of </p><p>computer and commo systems capable of sustaining a database. </p><p>End note.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Shater said he would take the U.S. offer to the </p><p>President.  He also noted that he believes draft arms control </p><p>legislation, designed to tighten controls on illicit trade </p><p>and ban the possession of heavy weapons, will be passed by </p><p>parliament this session -- despite political and popular </p><p>opposition. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (S/NF)  Comment:  This carefully orchestrated exchange </p><p>shows ROYG\'s commitment to controlling the illicit arms trade </p><p>and the President\'s desire to secure external funding to </p><p>expand ongoing efforts.  The continued removal of weapons </p><p>from the local market, legislation prohibiting their </p><p>possession, and the potential for increased technical </p><p>capabilities as offered by a DIA Team are encouraging </p><p>developments.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HULL </p><p></p></div>
