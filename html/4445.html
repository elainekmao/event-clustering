<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 008505 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CENTCOM AND EUCOM: PLEASE PASS TO POLADS AND J-5 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/21/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PINS, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY\'S NEW DEFENSE MINISTER: VECDI GONUL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ANKARA 8382 </p><p>     B. ANKARA 8252 </p><p>     C. ANKARA 8448 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by DCM Robert Deutsch. Reason: 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: GOT DefMin Gonul\'s principal political task </p><p>is to ensure smooth relations between his Islam-influenced AK </p><p>Party and a Turkish military which as adopted a wait-and-see </p><p>attitude while remaining on the lookout for any sign AK might </p><p>try to alter the current status of civilian-military </p><p>relations.  The cautious Gonul has the respect of the </p><p>Kemalists, but his private criticisms of the military </p><p>establishment suggest he will at a minimum try to effect </p><p>change at the margins to promote greater civilian oversight </p><p>of the Turkish Armed Forces\' (TAF) budgetary and other </p><p>processes.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>Gonul the State\'s-man? </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Turkish Defense Minister Mehmet Vecdi Gonul is a </p><p>long-time Embassy contact.  His vast experience (below) with </p><p>the organs of the state --  and the Deep State (refs A,B) -- </p><p>have earned him the confidence of many in the Kemalist </p><p>Establishment.  Gonul also served in the military with </p><p>President Sezer, a classic bonding experience.  As a result, </p><p>he is considered by Kemalists to be one of the most </p><p>"acceptable" senior figures in the Islam-influenced AK </p><p>(Justice and Development) Party government. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3 (C) It was a given that, as a former high civil servant, </p><p>Gonul would figure prominently in any AK government to help </p><p>mollify a wary Establishment.  We understand that Erdogan\'s </p><p>initial thinking was to hold him as an alternate P.M. </p><p>candidate in the event that Sezer rejected first choice </p><p>Abdullah Gul; then to pick him as AK\'s candidate for </p><p>parliamentary Speaker (thwarted by the challenge from AK </p><p>number three Bulent Arinc, ref C); then to appoint him as </p><p>FonMin.  In any event, Gonul\'s principal political task as </p><p>DefMin will be to manage AK\'s relations with Turkey\'s </p><p>politically powerful generals.  As DefMin, a notoriously weak </p><p>position with little direct control over military matters </p><p>(its chief function is defense procurement), Gonul will </p><p>function principally as a liaison between the TAF and AK, the </p><p>elected civilian government, and Parliament. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Nevertheless, Gonul exhibits some of the traits </p><p>frowned on in elite society but appreciated in his native </p><p>Kocaeli Province and elsewhere in conservative Anatolia. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) First, we have on good authority that Gonul has ties </p><p>to the Naksibendi tarikat.  This is a nominally illegal sufi </p><p>Islamic order, generally dominated by Kurds and characterized </p><p>now by tendencies toward quietism and serious religious </p><p>piety.  Gonul\'s patron, the late P.M./President Turgut Ozal </p><p>of the Motherland Party (ANAP) was a Naksibendi, as was </p><p>Ozal\'s Islamist brother Korkut -- a long-time Embassy contact </p><p>and senior Naksi figure in his own right.  Gonul is </p><p>reportedly close to Korkut.  In private meetings with us, </p><p>Gonul has evinced a remarkably intimate understanding of </p><p>tarikat history -- he sees the orders as a natural part of </p><p>Anatolian society -- and the current trends in tarikat </p><p>politics in Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Second, Gonul has repeatedly offered to us a strong </p><p>and comprehensive critique of military spending and budgetary </p><p>practices -- particularly the problems of accountability and </p><p>lack of legislative oversight of these processes.  Gonul, </p><p>like senior politicians from traditional centrist parties, </p><p>alleges that upwards of 40% of military expenditures is </p><p>completely unaccounted for, due largely to the TAF practice </p><p>of paying for military programs through a variety of </p><p>off-budget "funds" -- about which civilians know little.  The </p><p>day before he became Defense Minister, Gonul noted to us that </p><p>given the "sensitivities" of the generals, the AK government </p><p>is not eager to push hard for transparency and reform in </p><p>these areas any time soon (we have heard much the same from </p><p>other senior AK officials).  Nevertheless, he has hinted at </p><p>an indirect approach to imposing fiscal discipline on the TAF </p><p>as part of AK\'s across-the-board effort to end corruption and </p><p>promote accountability in the bureaucracy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) General bio data: </p><p>-- Born in Erzincan in eastern Turkey in 1939, Gonul </p><p>graduated from Ankara U. Political Sciences faculty (then the </p><p>premier training ground for future high civil servants) 1962, </p><p>later earning an M.S. in Public Administration from </p><p>University of Southern California. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- He then returned to Turkey and joined the Interior </p><p>Ministry.  After service as an inspector and finishing first </p><p>in his class of entering sub-governors, he served until 1970 </p><p>as a sub-governor in seven districts.  Worked in Interior </p><p>Ministry 1970-72.  Finishing first in the 1972 national </p><p>inspector exam, he was appointed to the inspector corps. </p><p>Appointed governor of Kocaeli (Izmit) in 1976, assigned to </p><p>directorate general of security (National Police) in 1977, </p><p>Central Governorship 1978, Ankara governor 1979, founding </p><p>member of High Education Council 1981, set up by the then </p><p>military regime to promote Kemalist propriety in the </p><p>universities.  1984 appointed Izmir governor, 1988 Interior </p><p>Ministry Undersecretary (under Minister Abdulkadir Aksu, </p><p>again Interior Minister in the new AK cabinet), 1991-98 </p><p>chairman of the Sayistay (Court of Accounts).  Gonul owed his </p><p>rise in part to his association with the Ozals.  1999 elected </p><p>to Parliament (his candidacy reflected Fazilet\'s own abortive </p><p>effort to move the Islamist movement to the political center) </p><p>and chosen as deputy Speaker.  After Fazilet was closed by </p><p>the courts, Gonul abandoned Erbakan in 2001, joining </p><p>Erdogan\'s AK at its founding and is a vice chairman.  Chosen </p><p>in 2001 as a member of the Turkish delegation to the Assembly </p><p>of the Council of Europe. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Married -- his wife does not wear the Islamic headscarf -- </p><p>with two sons, one daughter; Gonul speaks English fluently. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
