SUMMARY: ASSISTANT SECRETARY KANSTEINER\'S DECEMBER </p><p>   8-11 VISIT TO ZIMBABWE GENERATED COVERAGE IN BOTH PRINT </p><p>   AND ELECTRONIC MEDIA.  REPORTS IN PRIVATELY OWNED PRINT </p><p>   MEDIA WERE FACTUAL.  THE GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED ZIMBABWE </p><p>   BROADCASTING CORPORATION DISTORTED ITS COVERAGE TO GIVE </p><p>   THE IMPRESSION THAT THE UNITED STATES IS ATTEMPTING TO </p><p>   BULLY ZIMBABWE.  GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED PRINT MEDIA </p><p>   IGNORED KANSTEINER\'S VISIT.

END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.   ON DECEMBER 12, THE INDEPENDENT "DAILY NEWS" </p><p>   PUBLISHED A STRAIGHT ACCOUNT OF A/S KANSTEINER\'S </p><p>   DECEMBER 11 PRESS CONFERENCE IN HARARE.  UNDER THE </p><p>   HEADLINE "US ENVOY ENCOURAGES ZIMBABWE TO STEER TOWARD </p><p>   DEMOCRACY" THE PAPER\'S POLITICAL EDITOR OFFERED AN </p><p>   ACCURATE REPORT ON THE SUBSTANCE OF THE PRESS </p><p>   CONFERENCE AND DETAILS OF KANSTEINER\'S VISIT TO </p><p>   ZIMBABWE.  INDEPENDENT WEEKLY "THE FINANCIAL GAZETTE" </p><p>   ALSO PUBLISHED A COMPLETE AND FACTUAL ACCOUNT OF </p><p>   KANSTEINER\'S PRESS CONFERENCE UNDER THE HEADLINE "US </p><p>   OFFICIAL LAMBASTS (SIC) GOVERNMENT OVER RULE OF LAW." </p><p>   SUBHEAD READ: "A SENIOR US OFFICIAL SAID THIS WEEK THE </p><p>   RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OF ZIMBABWEANS WERE UNDER THREAT, </p><p>   BUT THERE IS STILL TIME FOR PRESIDENT ROBERT MUGABE\'S </p><p>   GOVERNMENT TO STEER THE COUNTRY TOWARD FREE AND FAIR </p><p>   ELECTIONS NEXT YEAR."  THE "FINANCIAL GAZETTE" ALSO </p><p>   PUBLISHED A FAVORABLE STORY ON US POLICY TOWARD </p><p>   ZIMBABWE.  THAT ARTICLE WAS BASED ON AN EMBASSY PRESS </p><p>   RELEASE ABOUT ZDERA, DISTRIBUTED AT THE KANSTEINER </p><p>   PRESS CONFERENCE AND TO A BROAD GROUP OF INFLUENTIAL </p><p>   ZIMBABWEANS.  COPIES OF THE "DAILY NEWS" AND "FINANCIAL </p><p>   GAZETTE" ARTICLES HAVE BEEN FAXED TO AF/S AND AF/PD. </p><p> </p><p>3.

IN ITS SEPTEMBER 11 PRIME-TIME NEWS </p><p>   PROGRAM, ZBC TV REPORTED THAT KANSTEINER HAD CALLED FOR </p><p>   SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>   FORUM OBSERVATION OF ZIMBABWE\'S PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. </p><p>   THE REPORTER SAID THAT THIS WAS "IN COMPLETE VIOLATION </p><p>   OF ZIMBABWE\'S CONSTITUTION."  THE REPORT WAS FALSE, AS </p><p>   KANSTEINER MADE NO MENTION OF SADC OBSERVATION OF </p><p>   ZIMBABWEAN ELECTIONS.  HE DID SUGGEST THAT SADC </p><p>   PARLIAMENTARY FORUM NORMS AND STANDARDS FOR ELECTIONS </p><p>   WOULD PROVIDE A GOOD BENCHMARK FOR EVALUATING THE </p><p>   FAIRNESS OF ZIMBABWE\'S ELECTIONS, BUT THE ZBC SEEMS TO </p><p>   HAVE MISSED THE POINT.  NONE OF THE OTHER 17 NEWS </p><p>   ORGANIZATIONS AT THE PRESS CONFERENCE MISUNDERSTOOD </p><p>   KANSTEINER\'S STATEMENTS.  THE EMBASSY RESPONDED </p><p>   IMMEDIATELY TO THIS DISTORTION WITH A PRESS RELEASE </p><p>   CORRECTING THE ZBC\'S REPORT.  ZBC TV AND RADIO COVERAGE </p><p>   OF THE PRESS CONFERENCE ALSO INCLUDED HEAVY </p><p>   EDITORIALIZING, CLAIMING THAT U.S. POLICY TOWARD </p><p>   ZIMBABWE WAS "ILLEGAL," THAT ZDERA WOULD HURT THE </p><p>   COMMON CITIZEN, AND THAT AMERICAN CRITICISM OF ZIMBABWE </p><p>   WAS DUE TO OPPOSITION TO LAND REFORM. </p><p> </p><p>4.   GOVERNMENT-OWNED NEWSPAPERS FAILED TO REPORT ON </p><p>   THE KANSTEINER VISIT.  A/S KANSTEINER CEREMONIALLY </p><p>   DELIVERED USG DONATIONS TO LOCAL HIV/AIDS </p><p>   ORGANIZATIONS, BUT THE "HERALD" REPORT ON THE DONATION </p><p>   SOMEHOW OMITTED MENTION OF HIS PRESENCE AT THE </p><p>   CEREMONY. </p><p> </p><p>5.
