<p>UNCLAS KATHMANDU 000926 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SEPT FOR INR/R, R/MR, I/RW, I/REC; PA, SA/PD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: OPRC, KMDR, NP, U.S-Nepali Relations </p><p>SUBJECT: Media Reaction: Nepal\'s Prime Minister Sher Bahadur </p><p>Deuba\'s visit to U.S. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  "Earnest Appeal" </p><p> </p><p>Editorial, government-owned "Rising Nepal" (E/D, 5/10): "...Firm </p><p>moral and material support to Nepal would also help </p><p>reinforce...the perception that the U.S. is fighting against all </p><p>forms and manifestations of terrorism, wherever they may be.  The </p><p>recent U.S. announcement of an assistance package to Nepal is </p><p>certainly useful.  But possibilities of an enhanced level of </p><p>development cooperation from the U.S. and extension of specific </p><p>facilities...those related to preferential access of Nepalese </p><p>products to the U.S. market, have to be looked into by American </p><p>leaders to help Nepal tide over the present adverse economic </p><p>situation.  The Nepalese sincerely hope that the U.S. government </p><p>and people have had a chance, during Mr. Deuba\'s current visit, to </p><p>understand Nepal\'s difficult situation and then to think of ways </p><p>to further advance the support to this country in need.  Its </p><p>earnest appeal must be heard with sympathy by all American </p><p>leaders." </p><p> </p><p>2.  "Deuba\'s U.S. visit: Enhancement of ties" </p><p> </p><p>Op-ed, Rising Nepal (E/D, 5/10): "...It may be worthwhile noting </p><p>that the visit of Prime Minister Deuba to the US holds promises of </p><p>further cooperation and support.  The US on its part has given the </p><p>assurance of continuing support and this is an achievement.  The </p><p>door has opened and Nepal will gain more in the days to come.  It </p><p>is also a fitting answer to all those who had been critical of the </p><p>Prime Minister\'s USA visit." </p><p> </p><p>3. "At the Oval" </p><p> </p><p>Editorial, India-leaning "Himalayan Times" (E/D, 5/10): "...A </p><p>country\'s standing in the comity of nations is measured not in </p><p>terms of who sees whom on how many occasions but on the basis of </p><p>its power, influence, resources and, more importantly, on its </p><p>commitment to the ideals of freedom, humanity, good governance and </p><p>respect for law.  If not in power and so forth, Nepal can score on </p><p>the latter counts.  The United States has been a good and reliable </p><p>friend of Nepal... In this hour of need, America has once again </p><p>demonstrated that when the chips are irrevocably down, it is there </p><p>to help." </p><p> </p><p>"...America\'s mention of Nepal as a democracy and the increase of </p><p>development assistance directed toward... initiatives described as </p><p>\'immediate high-impact job creation programs\' that can provide </p><p>opportunities to the unemployed segment, especially to the youth, </p><p>and that can improve the living conditions of the Nepalis in rural </p><p>areas is being treated with benign neglect.  This component of the </p><p>American commitment is also an anti-terrorist measure in that it </p><p>constitutes a package that seeks to dilute the widespread </p><p>disillusionment and frustration stemming from poverty, joblessness </p><p>and alienation.  The emphasis on \'rural areas\' which have the </p><p>fertile breeding ground for extremism should be taken to mean that </p><p>it is where the real problem lies, and it is where ultimately the </p><p>war has to be won.  The same holds true for democracy that is </p><p>being practiced in Nepal.  In order that the dispensation is safe </p><p>and secured, the political leadership just cannot shy away from </p><p>its bounden duty to strive for justice, equality and compassion </p><p>for the deprived and the downtrodden.  Meaningless rhetoric and </p><p>sloganeering won\'t do, not anymore."  MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
