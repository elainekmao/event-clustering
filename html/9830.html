REASON: 1.5 (B)(D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY:  DURING THEIR JULY 29 MEETING IN MOSCOW, </p><p>    RUSSIAN PRESIDENT PUTIN TOLD PM BERLUSCONI THAT RUSSIAN </p><p>COOPERATION WITH IRAN\'S NUCLEAR PROGRAM, INCLUDING THE </p><p>NUCLEAR FACILITY AT BUSHEHR, HAD CEASED.  THEY ALSO DISCUSSED </p><p>CLOSER EU-RUSSIAN RELATIONS, PREPARATIONS FOR PUTIN\'S </p><p>NOVEMBER 6 VISIT TO ROME AND THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT\'S VIEW </p><p>THAT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY SHOULD PARTICIPATE IN  IRAQ </p><p>RECONSTRUCTION WITHOUT WAITING FOR A UNSC RESOLUTION.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  BERLUSCONI\'S DEPUTY DIPLOMATIC ADVISOR, GIANPAOLO </p><p>SCARANTE, TOLD A/POLMINCOUNS AND POLOFF THAT DURING THEIR </p><p>JULY 29 MEETING IN MOSCOW, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT PUTIN TOLD PM </p><p>BERLUSCONI THAT RUSSIAN COOPERATION WITH IRAN\'S NUCLEAR </p><p>PROGRAM, INCLUDING THE NUCLEAR FACILITY AT BUSHEHR, HAD </p><p>CEASED.  RUSSIA HAS ALSO ASKED IRAN TO RETURN ALL NUCLEAR </p><p>MATERIAL TO RUSSIA.  PUTIN SAID THAT THE REASON WAS IRAN\'S </p><p>FAILURE TO SIGN THE IAEA ADDITIONAL PROTOCOL, AND THAT RUSSIA </p><p>WOULD NOT CONSIDER REVIVING ITS COOPERATION UNTIL IRAN SIGNED. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  SCARANTE SAID THAT THE MEETING, THE FIFTH BETWEEN </p><p>THE LEADERS SINCE BERLUSCONI BECAME PM, WAS QUICK (BERLUSCONI </p><p>FLEW UP FOR LUNCH THEN IMMEDIATELY RETURNED TO ROME), AND </p><p>FOCUSED MAINLY ON THEIR DESIRE TO MOVE THE EU-RUSSIAN </p><p>RELATIONSHIP FORWARD DURING THE ITALIAN PRESIDENCY.  THERE IS </p><p>A LOT OF WORK AHEAD TO PREPARE THE NOVEMBER 6 EU-RUSSIA </p><p>SUMMIT AND THE "CONCRETE AGREEMENTS" TO BE SIGNED IN ROME. </p><p>BERLUSCONI AND PUTIN WANT TO MAKE THE NEW EU-RUSSIA PERMANENT </p><p>PARTNERSHIP COUNCIL OPERATIONAL AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  COUNCIL </p><p>DISCUSSIONS SHOULD FOCUS ON THE ENERGY SECTOR, </p><p>TRANSPORTATION, THE ECONOMY, AGRICULTURE, AND THE ENVIRONMENT. </p><p> </p><p>    4. (C)  BERLUSCONI WAS IMPRESSED WITH PUTIN\'S "PRAGMATIC, </p><p>NON-IDEOLOGICAL" APPROACH TOWARDS INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY </p><p>INVOLVEMENT IN IRAQ\'S RECONSTRUCTION.  PUTIN\'S VIEW IS THAT </p><p>RUSSIAN COMPANIES HAVE EXPERIENCE IN DEALING WITH IRAQ, AND </p><p>COULD MAKE AN IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTION TO REBUILDING ITS </p><p>INFRASTRUCTURE.   PUTIN SAID THE RECONSTRUCTION COULD START </p><p>NOW, WITHOUT WAITING FOR A NEW UN RESOLUTION. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  ACCORDING TO SCARANTE, PUTIN SAID THAT WHILE RUSSIA </p><p>IS STILL PART OF THE MEPP "QUARTET" AND WILL CONTRIBUTE TO </p><p>THE PEACE PROCESS, IT WILL ACT MORE AS A "SPECTATOR" DURING </p><p>FUTURE NEGOTIATIONS. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p> 2003ROME03483 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
