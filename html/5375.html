(C) SUMMARY:  The Ambassador had a very interesting </p><p>conversation on January 29 with Ronnie De Mel, a close </p><p>adviser to President Kumaratunga and a senior MP in her </p><p>People\'s Alliance (PA) party.  De Mel downplayed recent </p><p>reports that the president was angling for early </p><p>parliamentary elections.  Despite reports, he also did </p><p>not think that a possible PA linkup with the radical JVP </p><p>party had gone beyond unofficial discussions.  De Mel is </p><p>a sober, longtime Mission contact, and his comments </p><p>indicate that in spite of all the smoke re various </p><p>political machinations there is not much fire -- at </p><p>least for the moment.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>================== </p><p>Dinner with De Mel </p><p>================== </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) The Ambassador had dinner at the residence of </p><p>Ronnie De Mel on January 29.  De Mel, 77, is a close </p><p>adviser to the president and a senior MP in her PA party </p><p>(his wife, Mallika, is also a PA MP).  De Mel\'s </p><p>residence, a fusion of Sri Lankan and "bungalow" design, </p><p>was quite elegant.  He also had a lovely -- and very </p><p>pricey collection of about 20 colorful, abstract </p><p>paintings by George Keyt, a well-known Sri Lankan </p><p>artist. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) De Mel also has a colorful past, almost </p><p>Churchillian in all of its twists-and-turns.  He was </p><p>originally a member of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party </p><p>(SLFP), joining the party in the 1960s when it was </p><p>headed by then-Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike. </p><p>After falling out with the irascible Bandaranaike, De </p><p>Mel defected to the United National Party (UNP) in the </p><p>1970s.  A close associate of President J.R. Jayewardene, </p><p>he served as finance minister for the UNP government in </p><p>the late 1970s and 1980s.  He left the UNP government in </p><p>the late 1980s as President Premadasa took the reigns of </p><p>power.  Premadasa was so angry with this that De Mel </p><p>felt obliged to flee Sri Lanka and go into exile for </p><p>several years.  (Note:  Discussing his break with </p><p>Premadasa, De Mel told the Ambassador that he was sick </p><p>and tired of him, particularly Premadasa\'s clear </p><p>willingness to use violence against political </p><p>opponents.)   After Premadasa was killed in a bomb </p><p>attack carried out by the Tigers in 1993, De Mel </p><p>rejoined the UNP only to crossover to the PA in 1999. </p><p>He served Kumaratunga\'s government as a senior minister </p><p>until the PA lost the December 2001 election. </p><p> </p><p>============================== </p><p>Doubts that Elections are Nigh </p><p>============================== </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Ambassador Wills asked De Mel about the recent </p><p>flurry of press reports citing the president and the </p><p>government as freely discussing the possibility of new </p><p>parliamentary elections.  (Note:  Per Refs A-B, </p><p>Kumaratunga was recently quoted as stating that she was </p><p>unhappy with the government, and was ready to dissolve </p><p>Parliament and call elections.  In response, UNP </p><p>Minister G.L. Peiris said the government was ready for </p><p>elections if they were called.)  De Mel said he </p><p>seriously doubted that the president had any plans to </p><p>call new elections soon.   She had not briefed PA MPs on </p><p>any plans of that sort.  He noted that he thought that </p><p>Kumaratunga was mercurial in temperament, so anything </p><p>might happen, but he just did not think she was readying </p><p>plans for elections at this point. </p><p> </p><p>======================== </p><p>Reports of PA-JVP Linkup </p><p>======================== </p><p>5.  (C) The Ambassador also asked about the consistent </p><p>drip of reports that the president and her PA party may </p><p>be considering some sort of alliance with the Sinhalese </p><p>extremist Janantha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) party. </p><p>(Note:  Per Ref C, various, vague reports are </p><p>circulating that the PA and JVP are discussing a linkup </p><p>in what would be a reprise of the formal alliance they </p><p>shared in late 2001.)  De Mel again downplayed the </p><p>reports.  He remarked that any contacts that the PA has </p><p>had with the JVP are "unofficial" and PA MPs as a group </p><p>have not approved them.  (Note:  The PA has a party rule </p><p>that MPs and other party officials must approve formal </p><p>efforts to reach out to other parties.)  In his </p><p>estimation, there might be some in the PA that wanted </p><p>such a link, but he did not see them getting their way </p><p>at any time soon. </p><p> </p><p>==================== </p><p>Re the Peace Process </p><p>==================== </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Queried about the status of the peace process, </p><p>De Mel commented that he hoped that it would succeed and </p><p>he generally supported the government\'s efforts.  He </p><p>said he had real doubts about the Tamil Tigers and their </p><p>intentions, however.  The Tigers have come part of the </p><p>way, but they still have a very long way to go before </p><p>they could be trusted and accepted by most Sri Lankans. </p><p>It was not clear whether the Tigers were flexible enough </p><p>to make the necessary changes, but he doubted they were. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) In a parenthetical comment, De Mel related that </p><p>he doubted the government had any chance of receiving </p><p>the two-thirds support in Parliament needed to approve </p><p>the constitutional aspects of any final settlement with </p><p>the LTTE.  About 25 of the 80 or so PA MPs were "center </p><p>right" and had been willing to consider working with the </p><p>government, he noted.  (Note:  De Mel counted himself in </p><p>this group.)  The government had "botched" cooperation </p><p>with this group, however, due to its poor handling of </p><p>the proposed constitutional amendment curbing executive </p><p>powers last year.  (Note:  In October 2002, the Supreme </p><p>Court essentially threw out the government\'s proposal -- </p><p>See Ref C.) </p><p> </p><p>======= </p><p>On Iraq </p><p>======= </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) In a brief colloquy re the Iraq situation, De </p><p>Mel said he doubted that there would be too many anti- </p><p>U.S. disturbances in Sri Lanka should there be a war. </p><p>He advised, however, that if war did take place it would </p><p>be wise for U.S. officials to avoid the east for awhile. </p><p>(Note:  Sri Lanka\'s Eastern Province has a large </p><p>population of Muslims, including some extremists.  See </p><p>Ref C re the latest on Sri Lankan reaction to the Iraq </p><p>situation.) </p><p> </p><p>======= </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>======= </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) De Mel is a sober, widely respected, and </p><p>longtime Mission contact.  (Note:  Some of the material </p><p>in our bio-file on him goes back to the early 1960s.) </p><p>His comments indicate that in spite of all the smoke re </p><p>various political machinations there is not much fire. </p><p>That said, "cohabitation" relations remain strained and </p><p>-- as De Mel noted -- Kumaratunga is mercurial.  Given </p><p>these unsteady variables, there remains the possibility </p><p>that Sri Lanka could wake up one fine morning and find </p><p>out that it is headed toward elections -- or that the PA </p><p>has again aligned itself with the extremist JVP -- or </p><p>both.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
