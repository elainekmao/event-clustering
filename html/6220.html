<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 RANGOON 000318 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR CA/VO/L/C </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:    N/A </p><p>TAGS: CVIS, CMGT, BM </p><p>SUBJECT: VISA BANS: A COMPARISON OF U.S. AND E.U. POLICIES </p><p>IN BURMA </p><p> </p><p>1. SUMMARY: An analysis of American and E.U. visa policies </p><p>toward Burmese "who formulate, implement, or benefit from </p><p>policies that impede Burma\'s transition to democracy" shows </p><p>that American and E.U. consular officials refuse to issue </p><p>visas to more or less the same people, but sometimes for </p><p>different reasons.  Although the two approaches yield </p><p>similar results, the American system is more flexible and </p><p>easier to implement. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>The U.S. Visa Ban </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  A 1996 Presidential Proclamation bans entry into the </p><p>United States, as immigrant or non-immigrants, of senior </p><p>Burmese government officials and "other persons who </p><p>formulate, implement, or benefit from policies that impede </p><p>Burma\'s transition to democracy" and their immediate family </p><p>members.   Such persons are ineligible to receive visas </p><p>under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), Section </p><p>212(f). </p><p> </p><p>3. Individuals in the following categories (and their </p><p>immediate families) are subject to INA Section 212(f): </p><p>-- State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) members; </p><p>-- Government ministers; </p><p>-- Senior officials of the Union Solidarity and Development </p><p>Association (USDA); </p><p>-- Other senior government officials above the rank of </p><p>colonel or director general. </p><p> </p><p>These categories overlap to a large extent.  For example, </p><p>the Minister of Defense is an SPDC member and USDA senior </p><p>officials are either SPDC members or cabinet ministers. </p><p>Some ministers and all SPDC members are generals. </p><p> </p><p>4.  These categories are enumerated for ease in </p><p>implementation; however, the ban is not limited to </p><p>individuals who fall within these categories.  Any other </p><p>person "who formulates, implements, or benefits from </p><p>policies that impede Burma\'s transition to democracy" could </p><p>be found ineligible to receive a visa under Section 212(f). </p><p> </p><p>5.  For practical reasons, the U.S. ban does not identify </p><p>specific individuals, but rather, categories of applicants </p><p>ineligible under 212(f).  U.S. embassies and consulates </p><p>accept visa applications from any applicant physically </p><p>present in their consular districts.  Consular sections </p><p>around the world could not be expected to recognize specific </p><p>individuals.  Any Burmese applicant who lists a rank above </p><p>colonel or a title above director general on his/her visa </p><p>application should be refused, regardless of where they </p><p>apply.  Also, the Burmese government often makes dramatic </p><p>personnel changes at the senior levels, which may or may not </p><p>be widely or promptly reported.  Maintaining an up-to-date </p><p>list of individuals ineligible under Section 212(f) would be </p><p>time-consuming and difficult. </p><p> </p><p>The E.U. Visa Ban </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  The E.U. annually develops a list of specific Burmese </p><p>officials who are ineligible to receive visas.  Their list </p><p>could be divided into the following categories: </p><p>-- SPDC members; </p><p>-- Potential SPDC members: </p><p>-- Regional commanders; </p><p>-- Cabinet ministers (includes deputy ministers); </p><p> </p><p>7.  All of the individuals listed by the British Embassy in </p><p>July 2002 fall into one or more of the categories used to </p><p>implement the U.S. visa ban.  However, some Burmese </p><p>officials that might fall into the U.S. catch-all category </p><p>of "other senior government officials above the rank of </p><p>colonel or director general" may not be specifically named </p><p>on the E.U. list (e.g., not all generals are SPDC, regional </p><p>commanders, or cabinet ministers). </p><p> </p><p>The E.U. Proposal </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  The E.U. proposes to expand their list to include senior </p><p>members of the USDA and "certain other individuals who </p><p>formulate, implement, or benefit from policies that impede </p><p>Burma/Myanmar\'s transition to democracy, and their </p><p>families."  This last category would include senior </p><p>officials of the Union of Myanmar Economic Holdings, Limited </p><p>(UMEHL) and companies owned by UMEHL, prominent bankers and </p><p>other "cronies." </p><p> </p><p>9.  Their proposed wording is virtually identical to the </p><p>wording of the Presidential Proclamation.  Thus, individual </p><p>businessmen specified on the E.U. list could also be found </p><p>ineligible to receive a visa under INA Section 212(f). </p><p>Although we might, in fact, refuse the same people, our </p><p>justification would be slightly different.  For example, </p><p>many UMEHL officials are retired generals and/or ministers </p><p>who the government rewarded for their services to the </p><p>regime.  Whereas the E.U. might refuse such UMEHL officials </p><p>as "cronies," we might refuse them for having been career </p><p>beneficiaries of regime policies. </p><p> </p><p>10.  On a practical level, identifying all persons who </p><p>"benefit from policies that impede Burma/Myanmar\'s </p><p>transition to democracy" is an impossible task.  Such a list </p><p>could only include the most conspicuous beneficiaries of </p><p>government policies.  "Behind-the-scene" beneficiaries could </p><p>travel freely.  Even if Western diplomats were able to </p><p>develop a comprehensive list of beneficiaries/cronies, it </p><p>would need to be constantly updated.  For example, prominent </p><p>private bankers who many would have considered "cronies" </p><p>three months ago, might not be considered so today.  In </p><p>fact, several of the bankers/businessmen on the E.U.\'s </p><p>proposed list might now be ineligible under INA Section </p><p>214(b) (presumed immigrant intent), rather than under </p><p>Section 212(f). </p><p>MARTINEZ </p><p></p></div>
