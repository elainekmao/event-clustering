<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ISTANBUL 000294 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, EUR AND EB </p><p>TREASURY FOR U/S TAYLOR AND OASIA - MILLS </p><p>NSC FOR QUANRUD AND BRYZA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, PREL, TU, Istanbul </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKS WEIGH AN IRAQ OPERATION\'S TOURISM IMPACT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>This is a joint Istanbul-Ankara cable.  Sensitive but </p><p>Unclassified - not for internet distribution. </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU)  Summary: Turkish government and tourism industry </p><p>officials are bracing in anticipation of a sharp downturn in </p><p>tourism in the event of an Iraq operation.  The sector, </p><p>Turkey\'s largest foreign exchange earner, turned in a good </p><p>performance in 2002, earning over 10 billion USD (27 percent </p><p>of all foreign currency income).  Anecdotal reports hinting </p><p>at reservation declines of 30-50 percent in the first months </p><p>of 2003 have led some to suggest that the sector could lose </p><p>4-5 billion USD for the year as a whole.  The Tourism </p><p>Minister is putting a braver face on the situation. </p><p>Unsurprisingly, all agree that while a quick and successful </p><p>operation\'s effect could be rapidly overcome, an extended </p><p>campaign would have a much larger impact.  Key tests will </p><p>come later this month at tourism fairs in Germany and </p><p>Russia--Turkey\'s largest tourism markets.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Already Feeling the Chill: Tourism Ministry </p><p>officials told Embassy Econ officer this week that Turkey is </p><p>already feeling the chill from war anxiety.  Summer travel </p><p>reservations that are usually made in January to February </p><p>have slowed considerably, they reported, while by some </p><p>anecdotal accounts hotel reservations are off by 30 to 50 </p><p>percent.  Istanbul\'s Ciragan Hotel, for instance, reports a </p><p>25 percent decline in bookings.  The Ministry\'s Acting Head </p><p>of External Relations, Tolga Tuyluoglu, admitted that </p><p>predicting the exact effect of a crisis is difficult, but </p><p>that based on Turkey\'s Gulf experience, a former Ministry </p><p>official has estimated that Turkey would lose 4-5 billion USD </p><p>in 2003 and 10-12 billion over the next three years.  This </p><p>year\'s target of 15 million travelers generating 12 billion </p><p>USD in revenue, already an ambitious increase from last </p><p>year\'s 10 billion USD level, would appear well out of reach. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Industry Predictions: Basaran Ulusoy, President of </p><p>the Association of Turkish Travel Agencies, told us on March </p><p>5 that the association concurs in estimates of a 40-50 </p><p>percent decline in tourism: without a war it estimates </p><p>tourism revenue at 10.35 billion USD; in the event of a war </p><p>it forsees only 5.5 billion USD in revenues (these totals do </p><p>not include the 1.5 billion USD that the government adds to </p><p>account for unrecorded income--the association thus </p><p>calculates 2002 revenue at 8.5 billion USD.)  ATA Invest, one </p><p>of Turkey\'s leading brokerages, predicts a slightly higher </p><p>level of tourism revenue for 2003--8.5 billion USD.  All </p><p>noted that beyond its importance to Turkish foreign exchange </p><p>earnings (27 percent last year), tourism is deeply interwoven </p><p>into the fabric of the Turkish economy, and by the Ministry\'s </p><p>count 38 associated sectors ranging from food to jewelry and </p><p>carpets will also be negatively impacted. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Anecdotes: Turkish Tourism Investors\' Association </p><p>(TYD) Secretary General Nedret Koruyan told us March 4 that </p><p>she is already hearing reports that travel agents in Europe </p><p>are pressing Turkish tourist facilities for price cuts, given </p><p>slumping demand.  Since prices never fully recovered from the </p><p>Gulf Crisis, however, she sees little margin for such </p><p>flexibility for the industry.  Ulusoy, whose family runs one </p><p>of Turkey\'s largest tourism conglomerates, noted numerous </p><p>anecdotal examples of the freeze in the market, ranging from </p><p>cancellation of 44 maritime cruises to Turkey (which will </p><p>severely impact the Kusadasi and Istanbul regions), to </p><p>rent-a-car firms backing out of car purchase agreements.  As </p><p>for the Association itself, while typically it purchases </p><p>eight million museum tickets from the Ministry of Culture to </p><p>sell at cost to its members, this year it is only taking 2.5 </p><p>million. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) A Brave Face: If privately Ministry officials are </p><p>pessimistic about Turkey\'s prospects, Tourism Minister Guldal </p><p>Aksit is putting a braver face on the situation.  She told </p><p>"Hurriyet" newspaper this week that she is an optimist, and </p><p>that by diversifying its tourism market, Turkey would be able </p><p>to limit an operation\'s impact.  Industry observers made </p><p>clear that while they do not share the Minister\'s views, they </p><p>understand that she must remain a cheerleader for the sector: </p><p>if she cried that the sky was falling, Ulusoy commented, it </p><p>would fall that much more quickly and lead banks to move to </p><p>foreclose on loans to the sector.  Already many companies </p><p>face bankruptcy, as reduced revenue flows will not cover </p><p>financing costs of the renovations and projects they </p><p>completed in the off-season. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Hoping for a Short War: Both Ulusoy and Koruyan </p><p>agreed that a short war, started soon and finished in a few </p><p>weeks, could limit the impact on the sector to 25-30 percent, </p><p>and permit it to recover in a few years.  However, even in </p><p>this case a significant impact is unavoidable, as the current </p><p>uncertainty has already begun to affect bookings, given that </p><p>March is the month in which many summer reservations are made </p><p>and in which airlines plan their summer schedules.  Ulusoy </p><p>reiterated a refrain we heard frequently last fall (and heard </p><p>in Ankara this week as well), in expressing regret that </p><p>international exigencies had prevented the operation from </p><p>being launched and completed in January and February. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) New Realities: Behind the high impact estimates are </p><p>several new realities facing the industry.  Turkey\'s </p><p>competitors have already started using the possibility of </p><p>military action against Iraq to promote themselves at </p><p>Turkey\'s expense.  Ulusoy noted Greece\'s new pitch to the </p><p>industry: "Come to Greece, there is no war in our </p><p>neighborhood."  Both Ulusoy and Koruyan noted that travel </p><p>contracts, beyond providing an out in case of force majeure </p><p>(such as war), also now include alternate destinations, so </p><p>that travelers can be easily rerouted to back-up locations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) Interrupted Progress: The uncertainty caused by the </p><p>Iraqi crisis has interrupted Turkey\'s strong rebound in 2002 </p><p>from the post-September 11 world tourism downturn.  Koruyan </p><p>characterized last year as a very good year, noting that </p><p>Turkey had experienced the largest increase in tourism in the </p><p>Mediterranean region.  January figures continued that trend, </p><p>with total arrivals increasing by 18 percent from 2002, and </p><p>EU arrivals increasing by 45 percent.  Even arrivals from the </p><p>U.S. and Japan, two countries that Koruyan characterized as </p><p>"lost markets" for Turkey, increased by 11 and 17 percent </p><p>respectively (though U.S. tourism in Turkey is still barely </p><p>half its pre-September 11 level).  (Note: MOT officials are </p><p>less willing to write off these markets, as American and </p><p>Japanese tourists typically spend more per capita than their </p><p>European counterparts.  End Note.)  Koruyan noted that Turkey </p><p>has benefited from its price advantage over rival </p><p>destinations in the Mediterranean: introduction of the Euro, </p><p>she suggested, had provided a pronounced edge over Spain and </p><p>Greece (which saw a 5.6 percent decline in tourism in 2002). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) Repackaging the Market:  Koruyan also gave some </p><p>credit for the strong results in 2002 to the Ministry of </p><p>Tourism\'s new advertising campaign.  While funding has </p><p>remained flat at 50 million USD, it has been refocused away </p><p>from Turkey as a general destination and towards emphasis of </p><p>specific  areas such as Antalya (especially popular among </p><p>Russians) and Bodrum (popular with British and German </p><p>tourists).  It is easier to distance such resorts from Iraq </p><p>than to distance Turkey as a whole, Koruyan suggested. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) Key Tests: Both Ministry and Industry contacts </p><p>stress that Turkey faces its key tests this month, with major </p><p>tourism fairs in both Germany and Russia, the country\'s two </p><p>key tourism markets (with 3.5 million and 950,000 visitors </p><p>respectively in 2002).  The industry pins special hopes on </p><p>the Russian market, which in the past has proven more crisis </p><p>resistant than its European counterparts.  But Ulusoy noted </p><p>that even a charter package from Kazakstan was recently </p><p>cancelled because of war concerns: "I thought they were used </p><p>to crises," he noted. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU) Comment: Given the sensitivity of the sector to </p><p>international conditions, a significant impact on Turkey from </p><p>both continued uncertainty and/or a war is unavoidable.  If </p><p>quick and decisive, however, observers concur that the impact </p><p>can be overcome.  They note too the potential upside from an </p><p>end to uncertainty and from a regime change in Iraq.  Ulusoy, </p><p>who professed strong support for U.S. goals in Iraq, </p><p>estimated that there are three to three-and-a-half million </p><p>potential annual visitors to Turkey from Iraq and the broader </p><p>Middle East who do not now travel because of the crisis.  End </p><p>Comment. </p><p>ARNETT </p><p></p></div>
