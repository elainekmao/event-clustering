<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 004319 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/09/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKISH REACTIONS TO IRAQ INCIDENT: AK GOVERNMENT </p><p>PROTECTING CLOSE BILATERAL TIES WITH U.S. </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ANKARA 4299 </p><p>     B. ANKARA 4278 </p><p>     C. ANKARA 4240 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Deputy Chief of Mission Robert S. Deutsch. </p><p>Reason: 1.5 (b)(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p>AK Government Underscores Importance of Relations with U.S. </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Speaking to reporters July 9, F.M. Gul expanded on the </p><p>AK Government\'s measured stance on the July 4 incident </p><p>involving U.S. and Turkish troops in Iraq.  Gul observed that </p><p>the visit of General Jones shows the importance the U.S. </p><p>attaches to friendship with Turkey.  Asked whether he thought </p><p>the U.S. action had been locally driven, Gul reiterated his </p><p>view (contrary to the view being espoused by the TGS through </p><p>press leaks) that he assumed it was so and continued to do so. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Gul also addressed growing Turkish concern that the </p><p>U.S. Senate will adopt an "Armenian genocide" resolution this </p><p>week.  "It is the Congress," he averred.  "That is, it is not </p><p>about the Administration.  The Administration is very </p><p>sensitive on this subject and is trying (to be constructive). </p><p> "It goes without saying that, in the end, parliaments and </p><p>assemblies are independent when making decisions." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>Senior AK Rep. Even Stronger in Private </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Following Gul\'s statement, we sought a telephone </p><p>readout from AK party deputy chairman for policy Firat (de </p><p>facto the number two man in the party hierarchy).  Firat </p><p>asked us to party headquarters, where in his usual low-key, </p><p>direct manner he made the following points: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- AK had expected the Turkish military to create </p><p>provocations in northern Iraq to use not only against the </p><p>U.S. but also domestically against AK. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- This latest incident has affected AK\'s democratization </p><p>drive in Turkey by giving "hawks in the TGS and other </p><p>Establishment circles" a tool to try to derail the seventh EU </p><p>harmonization package, which deals with civilianization of </p><p>the leadership of the National Security Council.  In </p><p>addition, he claimed, the hawks are using the incident to </p><p>interfere with passage of an effective draft law to </p><p>reintegrate repenting PKK/KADEK cadres.  In this regard, </p><p>Firat opined, the timing of the July 8 assassination attempt </p><p>against the governor of the southeastern province of Tunceli, </p><p>which the Turkish State is blaming on the PKK, suggest that </p><p>it may well have been a provocation organized by Turkish </p><p>security forces. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- The TGS is fanning a strident campaign through leaks to </p><p>the press, especially "Cumhuriyet," and to opposition CHP, </p><p>both of which Firat called "the spokesmen of the military," </p><p>to put pressure on AK and to divert attention from military </p><p>culpability in Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Given the way the Turkish State and armed forces are </p><p>structured, Firat said, it is doubtful that the Turkish </p><p>Special Forces in Suleimaniya acted independently of senior </p><p>military leadership.  At the same time, Firat added, Ozkok </p><p>did not appear to be directly responsible for whatever was </p><p>going on; the problem as AK sees it is that Ozkok is not in </p><p>full control.  In this regard, the TGS-directed media </p><p>campaign, he noted, is directed in part at affecting the </p><p>outcome of the end-of-August Supreme Military Council (YAS) </p><p>meeting, which ratifies the annual cycle of senior promotions </p><p>and retirements in the military. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- A May poll which AK commissioned through ANAR (whose </p><p>chairman is a state minister in the AK government but whose </p><p>results have consistently been on target since well before </p><p>the Nov. 2002 general elections) showed that only 11% of </p><p>respondents nationwide would support a military coup, while </p><p>75% would oppose it. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Turning to the "Armenian genocide" question, Firat said </p><p>that Gul is in secret talks with the Armenians and the AK </p><p>government seeks a way to open the border and establish </p><p>normal relations with Armenia in the near future.  Passage of </p><p>a resolution by the U.S. Senate would set this process back, </p><p>he concluded. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
