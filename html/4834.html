<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 FRANKFURT 011843 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINR, GM </p><p>SUBJECT: HESSE ELECTIONS COUNTDOWN: CDU CONFIDENT, BUT WILL </p><p>FDP MAKE 5 PERCENT THRESHOLD? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary.  Hesse state elections will take place </p><p>February 2, 2003.  The current Christian Democratic Union </p><p>(CDU)-Free Democratic Party (FDP) state coalition government </p><p>is hoping the current voter mood against the national SPD- </p><p>Green government will help it win votes.  The CDU is </p><p>optimistic about its chances for victory and the dynamic </p><p>Hesse Minister-President Roland Koch has been campaigning </p><p>vigorously.  It is unlikely the CDU can win an absolute </p><p>majority, however, so would still need the FDP to govern. </p><p>The state FDP, like the national one, is somewhat weak and </p><p>in disarray.  It just squeaked over the 5 percent threshold </p><p>in 1999 with 5.1 percent, but is hoping that a protest vote </p><p>against SPD-Green will help carry it this time.  The state </p><p>Social Democratic Party (SPD) is counting on candidate </p><p>Boekel\'s strong team and his image as a man of integrity who </p><p>is "close to the people."  Boekel has also been campaigning </p><p>hard but the CDU-FDP still have a 9.4 percent lead over SPD- </p><p>Green.  The Greens are campaigning on core party issues and </p><p>opposition to Frankfurt airport expansion.  The election </p><p>outcome is still too close to call.  Hesse is still a "swing </p><p>state."  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Hesse state elections will take place February 2, </p><p>2003 and several conventions and strategy meetings have been </p><p>held by the four state parties represented in parliament </p><p>(CDU, SPD, FDP, Green Party).  The Hesse state parliament is </p><p>elected for five years.  Currently, the CDU and FDP have a </p><p>one-seat majority in the 110-member legislature (56:54). </p><p> </p><p>The Hesse CDU: Optimistic </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) The CDU, as demonstrated during its November </p><p>convention in Fulda, is optimistic it will be the strongest </p><p>party in the next state assembly.  Our CDU contacts across </p><p>the board give us the same view, particularly in light of </p><p>voter unhappiness with the SPD-Green government nationally. </p><p>The Hesse CDU may, in fact, be overly confident that "the </p><p>election is already won."  Some of our CDU contacts do worry </p><p>that the party\'s coalition partner, the FDP, may fail to </p><p>make the 5 percent threshold to get into the state </p><p>parliament -- the FDP only achieved 5.1 percent in 1999 - </p><p>but do not see it as a serious danger.  Within the Hesse </p><p>CDU, two campaign strategies are being debated.  One group </p><p>prefers a campaign that is inclusive of the FDP and "pulls </p><p>it along" in a battle for the second vote </p><p>("Zweitstimmenkampagne").  Another group, apparently gaining </p><p>momentum, seeks to win an absolute CDU majority without </p><p>carrying the FDP.  As insider from Koch\'s State Chancellery </p><p>tell us this latter strategy may be implemented on short </p><p>notice in January, if the polls show it could succeed.  A </p><p>recent poll shows the CDU could win about 46 percent in </p><p>Hesse. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) We heard from CDU\'s Parliamentary Manager Stefan </p><p>Gruettner and members of the caucus that the CDU expects its </p><p>lead in the opinion polls created by "the Berlin effect" </p><p>(i.e. dissatisfaction with Chancellor Schroeder) to continue </p><p>at least until Christmas.  The biggest danger he sees to a </p><p>CDU election victory in Hesse is U.S. action in Iraq before </p><p>the February 2 elections.  In an effort to forestall </p><p>possible voter backlash against the CDU for being too pro- </p><p>U.S. and pro-war, Koch is heating up the rhetoric on the </p><p>dangers of terrorism.  He and his Social Minister Silke </p><p>Lautenschlaeger have been outspoken on the need to have </p><p>vaccines prepared against potential biological weapons. </p><p>"Other nations are preparing smallpox vaccine.  Germany is </p><p>doing nothing," Koch said.  Koch\'s Interior Ministry is </p><p>repeating terrorism warnings, despite opposition from some </p><p>party colleagues such as Frankfurt Lord Mayor Petra Roth. </p><p>(Comment: As Koch and other CDU officials have told us, the </p><p>CDU plans to push back against SPD-fostered pacifism, unlike </p><p>during last September\'s national campaign, when Stoiber\'s </p><p>cautious - indeed timid - response backfired. End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) In response to an FDP complaint that the CDU has </p><p>given it too little room to maneuver, Gruettner said that </p><p>the FDP misses opportunities.  The Hesse FDP Economics </p><p>Minister Dieter Posch, for example, has said little, while M- </p><p>P Koch has done most of the heavy lifting on economic </p><p>issues. (Note: The FDP has two ministers in Hesse, Economics </p><p>Minister Posch and Minister for Science and Arts Ruth </p><p>Wagner, who is also Deputy Minister President.) </p><p>Gruettner also strongly rejected media speculation that Koch </p><p>would leave politics if he is defeated in February.  "Anyone </p><p>who knows the Minister-President knows this is nonsense," </p><p>Gruettner said.  (Comment:  We agree.  Koch is only in his </p><p>mid-40s, is energetic and ambitious, and has been involved </p><p>in politics since he was 14 years old.  End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p>The SPD: Focus on the Team </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) The Hesse SPD\'s strategy is to highlight Boekel as </p><p>a competent leader with a good shadow cabinet, rather than </p><p>"Koch bashing" about the Hesse CDU\'s party financing </p><p>scandal.  "Our big advantage," says SPD Parliamentary </p><p>Manager and shadow Interior Minister Manfred Schaub, "is </p><p>Koch\'s lack of popularity and the high marks Boekel gets for </p><p>credibility."  The campaign will focus less directly on </p><p>challenging the CDU slogan "SPD-Green Needs Supervision" </p><p>than previously planned.  Instead it will highlight Boekel </p><p>as close to the people and show the SPD\'s team of experts </p><p>balanced between men and women. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) The Hesse SPD is painfully aware of the voter anger </p><p>with the federal government in Berlin that will surely have </p><p>an impact on state elections both in Hesse and Lower Saxony. </p><p>To distinguish himself Chancellor Schroeder and Finance </p><p>Minister Eichel, Boekel has supported the re-introduction of </p><p>a wealth tax that will have a greater impact on high-income </p><p>households and be more socially equitable.  The Hesse SPD </p><p>believes hopes that in the coming weeks, voter distress with </p><p>Berlin will calm down and the FDP will fail to gain the 5 </p><p>percent necessary to enter parliament, making an SPD </p><p>election victory in February  possible.  Privately, however, </p><p>party members admit that they need the Green Party to win. </p><p>They hope both the SPD and Green Party will improve on their </p><p>1999 election results.  (Comment: The SPD\'s Boekel is still </p><p>seen as a bit of a "pale" candidate in comparison with the </p><p>dynamic Koch, although Boekel has appeared more frequently </p><p>in recent weeks on talks shows and in the media to raise his </p><p>profile.  Recent polls show the number of voters who </p><p>recognize Boekel has risen from 27 percent in August to 51 </p><p>percent in November.  End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p>The Greens: Will Gain Votes, Oppose Frankfurt Airport </p><p>Expansion </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) Most observers across the political spectrum in </p><p>Hesse believe the Greens will gain more votes than the 7.2 </p><p>percent they had in 1999.  A recent poll shows they could </p><p>win as much as 10-11 percent in the state.  Under the </p><p>leadership of its young and energetic Caucus Chairman Tarek </p><p>Al Wazir, the party has kept up a relatively high profile. </p><p>The Hesse Greens are expected to pick up votes in south </p><p>Hesse protesting Frankfurt airport expansion, particularly </p><p>in the absence of any other protest party running.  (The </p><p>Hesse Green Party has been very outspoken against Frankfurt </p><p>airport expansion.  Several communities around the airport </p><p>along with environmental groups have filed complaints and </p><p>lawsuits by the hundreds against the potential noise </p><p>increase.  U.S. carriers are in favor of Frankfurt airport </p><p>expansion.)  The Hesse Green party seems to be largely </p><p>unaffected by the present problems of the Schroeder </p><p>government. </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU)  The Hesse Greens have emphasized core issues in </p><p>the campaign: environmental and consumer health issues, </p><p>civil rights and education.  The party is clearly committed </p><p>to a coalition with the SPD.  With the exception of </p><p>Frankfurt airport expansion, which parts of the SPD somewhat </p><p>reluctantly support, the Greens have no major differences </p><p>with the SPD.  The Hesse Greens feel they can turn the SPD </p><p>around to oppose Frankfurt airport expansion.  As the </p><p>party\'s manager, Dirk Langolf tells us, he is certain the </p><p>SPD-Green coalition will find a way to "smoothly phase out </p><p>airport expansion plans, should we win a victory in </p><p>February." </p><p> </p><p>FDP: In Trouble </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) The mood in the Hesse FDP is worse than it </p><p>appears.  Though the Hesse FDP is not directly affected by </p><p>the "Moellemann factor" it is clearly suffering.  The Hesse </p><p>FDP tends to be right of center and has a strong pro-Jewish </p><p>spin in Hesse.  The legacy of the late Chairman of the </p><p>Jewish Council and FDP member Ignatz Bubis still carries a </p><p>lot of weight.  The Hesse FDP just squeaked over the </p><p>threshold with 5.1 percent in the 1999 state.  The FDP hopes </p><p>that the current public mood against the national SPD-Green </p><p>government will win it some protest votes in February.  A </p><p>recent poll shows they could get 6 percent in the state. </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU) The Hesse FDP is clearly disappointed with its CDU </p><p>coalition partner.  It feels it never received credit for </p><p>reviving Koch\'s political career in the wake of the Hesse </p><p>CDU financing scandal.  (Koch nearly resigned in 2000 when </p><p>the scandal was at its peak.)  The Hesse FDP tends not to </p><p>recognize its own weaknesses.  Only the rebellious youth </p><p>wing of the party has the courage to criticize Hesse </p><p>Economics Minister Posch and Minister for Science and Arts </p><p>Ruth Wagner for a poor public profile. </p><p> </p><p>Prediction: CDU and Greens Will Gain Votes in February, but </p><p>Future Coalition Still Open </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p> </p><p>12. (SBU) At this time we predict there will be two parties </p><p>gaining votes in Hesse on election day February 2: the CDU </p><p>and the Greens.  Whether the Hesse government will be CDU- </p><p>FDP or SPD-Green is still open.  We believe, however, than </p><p>an absolute majority for the CDU is unlikely so the CDU </p><p>still needs the FDP.  The FDP needs to get over the 5 </p><p>percent threshold for the coalition to succeed.  Hesse can </p><p>still be considered a classic swing state.  We believe the </p><p>current CDU-FDP coalition has a slight edge, especially if </p><p>the prevailing mood of dissatisfaction with the Schroeder </p><p>government continues.  A recent poll shows CDU-FDP has a 9.4 </p><p>percent lead over SPD-Green. </p><p> </p><p>13.  This message was coordinated with Embassy Berlin. </p><p> </p><p>BODDE </p><p></p></div>
