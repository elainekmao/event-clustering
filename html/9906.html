<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L  JERUSALEM 002293 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR NEA FRONT OFFICE AND NEA/IPA; NSC FOR </p><p>ABRAMS/DANIN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/04/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KWBG, KPAL, IS </p><p>SUBJECT: HAMAS READY TO EXTEND TRUCE, PA MINISTER CLAIMS </p><p> </p><p>REF: TEL AVIV 4401 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Acting Principal Officer Jeffrey Feltman, per 1.5 (b) an </p><p>d (d). </p><p> </p><p>(U)  This cable has been cleared with Embassy Tel Aviv. </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  Following up on his conversation with Embassy PolOff </p><p>last week (reftel), PA Minister of Culture Ziad Abu-Amr, in a </p><p>meeting with A/PO in Ramallah on 8/4, said that Hamas leaders </p><p>would tell PA Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas in Gaza this week </p><p>that they are prepared to extend the cease-fire for an </p><p>additional three months.  During that time, Abu-Amr insisted, </p><p>the PA must move decisively toward municipal elections as a </p><p>way to channel Hamas\' "energy" into a permanent buy-in to the </p><p>PA\'s political program, including negotiations for a </p><p>two-state solution.  Hamas is ready, Abu-Amr argued, and may </p><p>even be ready to participate in PA elections (which would </p><p>symbolize belated acceptance of the Oslo political </p><p>landscape).  Bringing Hamas on board without a major </p><p>confrontation is not appeasement but realism, Abu-Amr </p><p>insisted:  the PA might very well lose an outright fight and, </p><p>even if the PA largely prevailed, the result of a </p><p>confrontation might be splinter cells that are impossible to </p><p>root out.  It is far better to capitalize upon what he </p><p>described as the extreme internal discipline of Hamas (which </p><p>he compared favorably with the unruly nature of Fatah) to end </p><p>the violence once and for all through an internal political </p><p>process that includes Hamas.  If the cease-fire unravels, he </p><p>predicted, it will be due to a process started by Al-Aqsa </p><p>and/or Israeli actions, not something Hamas starts.  End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p>HAMAS TO TELL ABU MAZEN </p><p>"YES" ON EXTENDING CEASE-FIRE </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  In his high-rise Ramallah office overlooking the </p><p>ruins of the Muqatta\'a, Abu-Amr continued his conversation </p><p>begun the previous week with Embassy PolOff on the PA-Hamas </p><p>dialogue (reftel).  Hamas leaders, he predicted, will tell </p><p>Abbas in Gaza this week that they are prepared to extend the </p><p>cease-fire ("hudna" was the word Abu-Amr used throughout the </p><p>conversation) for an additional three months.  Hamas leaders, </p><p>keenly monitoring popular reactions, sense that the </p><p>Palestinian population at this point largely supports the </p><p>cease-fire;  moreover, the Hamas external leadership is still </p><p>feeling the pressure of U.S. demands on Syria.  Thus it has </p><p>not been all that difficult, Abu-Amr claimed, to persuade </p><p>them to extend the cease-fire. </p><p> </p><p>DANGER TO CEASE-FIRE NOT </p><p>(IN FIRST INSTANCE) FROM HAMAS </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  As he had last week, Abu-Amr dismissed concerns that </p><p>Hamas or rogue elements thereof might unilaterally start </p><p>actions that break the cease-fire.  Citing the "extreme </p><p>discipline" of Hamas, Abu-Amr expressed far more worry about </p><p>unilateral Israeli moves or Al-Aqsa Martryrs Brigade attacks </p><p>that could invite Israeli retaliation that would cause the </p><p>cease-fire to unravel.  Abu-Amr referred with worry to the </p><p>Al-Aqsa-claimed firing that wounded four people near Gilo the </p><p>previous night.  While Palestinian disappointment over what </p><p>they perceive as the inadequate Israeli positive response to </p><p>the drop in violence and threats "seriously weakens" the </p><p>commitment to the cease-fire, Hamas, he insisted, will not be </p><p>the ones to endanger the cease-fire. </p><p> </p><p>HAMAS LEADERS MORE MODERATE </p><p>THAN THE STREET </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  At the same time, Hamas will not be able to extend </p><p>the cease-fire indefinitely without something to show for it. </p><p> The considerable "energy" that has been focused over the </p><p>past few years in "waging the Intifada" must be channeled </p><p>elsewhere.  Hamas leaders in Gaza are "more moderate" than </p><p>their young followers, Abu-Amr insisted, and are ready to </p><p>turn the movement toward what the PA would consider more </p><p>constructive and more acceptable activities.  (Abu-Amr </p><p>claimed that the fiery Abdulaziz Rantissi was the exception </p><p>to his claim that the Gaza leadership was more moderate. </p><p>Rantissi\'s "problem," he said, is personal, in that he bears </p><p>severe grudges against the "humiliations" he suffered at the </p><p>hands of Mohammed Dahlan\'s forces in 1996, when Dahlan had </p><p>Rantissi shaved and jailed.)  In this, the "more moderate" </p><p>Hamas leaders are assisted by the Hamas prisoners in Israel, </p><p>whose prison experience has generally given them a "more </p><p>sophisticated,less radical" understanding of their political </p><p>horizons.  (Abu-Amr digressed at this point to a "law of </p><p>diminishing returns" regarding the prisoners -- that, having </p><p>gone through a period of moderation, they risked becoming </p><p>radicalized if Israel continued to stall on prisoner </p><p>releases, doing only small numbers begrudgingly.) </p><p> </p><p>CHANNELING HAMAS </p><p>ENERGY TO ELECTIONS </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  Abu-Amr speculated that, before the expiry of the </p><p>second three-month cease-fire, the PA must be in the midst of </p><p>serious preparations for "rolling" municipal elections. </p><p>Elections, rather than the conflict with Israel, would then </p><p>become the focus for Hamas and other groups.  Everyone\'s </p><p>attention, he predicted, would be on the local races, rather </p><p>than on Israeli action.  A/PO asked what sort of standard the </p><p>PA would insist upon as the price for Hamas\' admisssion to </p><p>the elections, commenting that the PA should not entertain </p><p>the thought of allowing participation in elections by any </p><p>group that maintained illegal military wing and considered </p><p>violence an acceptable political tool. </p><p> </p><p>HAMAS MUST BUY ON TO PROGRAM </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  Abu-Amr agreed that Hamas must subscribe to the </p><p>basic parameters of the PA and PLO program, which he </p><p>articulated as renunciation of violence, acceptance of a </p><p>two-state solution and Israel\'s right to exist in peace and </p><p>security, and resolution of the conflict through </p><p>negotiations.  Abu-Amr claimed that the Hamas leaders are </p><p>already "more or less" committed to these ideas but need to </p><p>have a political excuse, cover and incentive -- which </p><p>elections would provide -- to be more explicit on these </p><p>points.  It is good, Abu-Amr said, that Islam as an ideology </p><p>is flexible -- one can find justification for fighting, and </p><p>one can find justification for ending the physical fight in </p><p>favor of political fights.  "The doctrine is hospital to </p><p>change."  A/PO asked whether the PA would insist on written </p><p>commitments to this effect by any candidates or groups that </p><p>would choose to participate in the elections, but Abu-Amr, </p><p>avoiding a direct answer, responded that all would be decided </p><p>as preparations for local elections geared up.  A/PO </p><p>reiterated the point that Hamas would never be accepted by </p><p>the U.S. and Israel as a legitimate political faction as long </p><p>as it maintained its military wing and left open the </p><p>possibility of returning to violence. </p><p> </p><p>HAMAS READY FOR PA ELECTIONS, TOO? </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  Musing about how he has witnessed the evolution in </p><p>thinking by the local Hamas leaders, Abu-Amr speculated that, </p><p>once conditions are right for PA legislative and presidential </p><p>elections, Hamas would also want to field candidates in those </p><p>races.  This is a revolution in Hamas thinking, he argued. </p><p>Before, Hamas leaders always left open the idea of </p><p>participating for local or "national" (PLO-wide) office, but </p><p>they clearly rejected any PLC elections that might bless what </p><p>Hamas viewed as an illegitimate Oslo-based institution.  By </p><p>hinting that they would field Hamas candidates in PLC races, </p><p>Hamas leaders are again underscoring their acceptance of the </p><p>Olso political landscape including a negotiated settlement </p><p>with Israel.  Abu-Amr also noted, however, the </p><p>"impossibility" of legislative elections in the current </p><p>period.  He cited two roadblocks:  the Israeli occupation of </p><p>most West Bank cities, and the U.S. hostility to PA </p><p>presidential elections (as long as Arafat would emerge as a </p><p>viable candidate) which the Palestinians would insist </p><p>accompany any legislative elections. </p><p> </p><p>TRYING TO CAPITALIZE </p><p>ON HAMAS DISCIPLINE </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  When A/PO cautioned Abu-Amr that the PA must be very </p><p>careful not to encourage a process that would in effect </p><p>extend a lifeline to terrorist groups that must be fought, </p><p>Abu-Amr responsed that co-opting the majority of Hamas </p><p>members through elections was "not appeasement."  If the PA </p><p>launched a frontal battle against Hamas now, he said, "we </p><p>would lose."  Even if, with time, the PA would prevail in an </p><p>outright military confrontation, "we would create a thousand </p><p>splinter groups," individual cells that would step up attacks </p><p>on the PA and -- especially -- on Israel, since Israel would, </p><p>"based on its behavior over the past three years," pound the </p><p>PA in retaliation to what Hamas was doing.  The plethora of </p><p>"splinter groups" would be impossible to root out.  Abu-Amr </p><p>described this scenario as a "lose-lose" proposition. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  What he is proposing, Abu-Amr said, is a "pragmatic, </p><p>realistic" approach:  use the best quality of Hamas, its </p><p>internal discpline, to end the violence definitively in favor </p><p>of a political approach.  If elections can induce the Hamas </p><p>leadership to echo Abu Mazen\'s message that the armed </p><p>Intifada is over, then the majority of the Hamas cadres would </p><p>be on board.  It would be relatively easy for the PA to crush </p><p>those elements that do not go along with the Hamas </p><p>leadership, since the numbers would be relatively few, he </p><p>predicted, and because they would be defying the wishes of </p><p>the collective Palestinian leadership. </p><p> </p><p>CRITICAL ELEMENTS OF THIS SCENARIO: </p><p>ISRAELI ACTION AND MOVEMENT ON REFORM </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C)  Abu-Amr closed by saying that his relatively rosy </p><p>scenario assumed two things:  that Israel would take steps </p><p>forward, even if more slowly than the Palestinians would </p><p>like, that strengthened the PA, and that the PA itself </p><p>proceeds as quickly as possible with its domestic reform </p><p>program.  Both of those elements would bring credibility to </p><p>the Abu Mazen government, he said, and would illustrate to </p><p>the population the benefits of Abu Mazen\'s policies.  If </p><p>Israeli steps or Palestinian reform stall completely -- and </p><p>he criticized both for not moving quickly enough -- then he </p><p>was worried that his scenario for co-opting Hamas through </p><p>elections might not work as well as he had just outlined. </p><p>For that reason, he said, he has become a "real nag" in PA </p><p>cabinet meetings about the need to move forward on reforms </p><p>other than in the financial area, "the only sector where our </p><p>record is excellent." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FELTMAN </p><p></p></div>
