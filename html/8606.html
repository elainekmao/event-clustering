(C) SUMMARY:  The Tokyo donors conference has </p><p>generally netted a highly positive reaction in Sri </p><p>Lanka.  Media coverage was lavish and upbeat.  D\'s </p><p>address was considered constructive by all quarters. </p><p>The PM\'s speech received a mixed reaction, however, with </p><p>some Tamils skeptical of his promise to discuss forming </p><p>an interim structure in the north/east.  The Tamil </p><p>Tigers and the president have not issued a public </p><p>reaction as of late June 10.  Overall, despite the </p><p>absence of the Tigers, the conference and its aid </p><p>pledges went a long way toward restoring some of the </p><p>peace process\' lost momentum.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>Positive Reaction to Tokyo </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) The Tokyo donors conference has generally </p><p>received a highly positive reaction in Sri Lanka. </p><p>(Note:  This message covers the first day of the </p><p>June 9-10 conference when most of the major speeches </p><p>were made.  This message does not touch on reaction to </p><p>the "Tokyo Declaration on Reconstruction and Development </p><p>of Sri Lanka," which was issued mid-day local time, </p><p>June 10.)  Media coverage was lavish and basically </p><p>positive.  Newspapers, including English-, Sinhala-, and </p><p>Tamil-language, had banner headlines regarding the </p><p>conference.  In the meantime, there was fulsome coverage </p><p>on local TV channels, and on satellite channels such as </p><p>CNN and BBC.  Most of the media coverage (both press and </p><p>TV) dealt with the addresses given by Prime Minister </p><p>Wickremesinghe and Deputy Secretary Armitage, as well as </p><p>the aid pledges made by conference attendees. </p><p>(Note:  See our media reaction cable for a more detailed </p><p>review of press play.) </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>Praise for D\'s Address </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) While reaction to PM Wickremesinghe\'s remarks </p><p>was decidedly mixed (see below), the address by Deputy </p><p>Secretary Armitage was considered constructive by all </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>quarters.  Representative comments re his remarks </p><p>included the following: </p><p> </p><p>-- The highly respected Roman Catholic Bishop of Jaffna </p><p>T. Savundranayagam told us he was very happy with the </p><p>firm tone of D\'s comments and the U.S.\' clear commitment </p><p>to stand by Sri Lanka during this difficult period.  The </p><p>bishop added that the Deputy Secretary\'s speech should </p><p>help bring the GSL and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil </p><p>Eelam (LTTE) back to the negotiating table.  He also </p><p>commented that it was very unfortunate that the LTTE had </p><p>decided not to participate in Tokyo, but he hoped the </p><p>group would appreciate the good that came out of the </p><p>conference for the Tamil people. </p><p> </p><p>-- Joseph Pararajasingham, a pro-LTTE MP for the Tamil </p><p>National Alliance, said he thought the Deputy </p><p>Secretary\'s speech was "quite balanced and careful."  He </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>said he thought the LTTE would review the speech very </p><p>carefully, including its call for the Tigers to return </p><p>to the peace talks. </p><p> </p><p>-- Kethesh Loganathan, a political analyst with the </p><p>Center for Policy Alternatives, a local think-tank, told </p><p>us that he thought D\'s remarks were very positive.  In </p><p>particular, Loganathan appreciated D\'s urging of the </p><p>LTTE to work to build trust.  At the same time, </p><p>Loganathan thought it was important that the Deputy </p><p>Secretary had made clear that the international </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>community was not trying to isolate the LTTE, but saw </p><p>the group as a political actor in Sri Lanka that needed </p><p>to transform itself. </p><p> </p><p>(Note:  Alone among the major addresses, the text of D\'s </p><p>speech was posted on the pro-Tiger website "TamilNet." </p><p>There was no commentary attached to the text.  For more </p><p>re Tiger reaction please see Para 6.) </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>PM nets Mixed Reaction </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) The prime minister\'s speech received a mixed </p><p>reaction.  In discussions with contacts, some Tamils </p><p>were a bit skeptical of the PM\'s promise to discuss </p><p>forming an interim structure in the north/east.  Joseph </p><p>Pararajasingham, the pro-LTTE MP, for example, told us </p><p>that Tamils "hoped the PM would be able to deliver on </p><p>his promises," but wondered about the follow through by </p><p>the government.  In any case, Pararajasingham -- echoing </p><p>recent comments made by the LTTE itself -- said "it was </p><p>no longer time for talk, but for action" by the GSL.  In </p><p>the meantime, leader of the generally anti-LTTE People\'s </p><p>Liberation Organization of Tamil Eelam (PLOTE) D. </p><p>Sithadthan characterized reaction among Tamils as "wait- </p><p>and-see."  He said he thought that the stalemate that </p><p>was now affecting the peace track would only end when </p><p>aid began flowing into the north and east. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Regarding opinion in the majority Sinhalese </p><p>community, a well-respected Buddhist monk, the Venerable </p><p>Wimalaratana, told us that he thought the conference was </p><p>highly successful.  (Note: Wimalaratana is a member of </p><p>the moderate mainstream group of Sri Lanka\'s monks.)  He </p><p>welcomed the fact that the prime minister was trying to </p><p>bring peace to the country.  That said, Wimalaratana </p><p>said he was concerned that the PM\'s proposal re an </p><p>interim structure not be construed by the Tigers as </p><p>potentially giving the group political control of the </p><p>north/east.  Rather, it should be seen as giving the </p><p>group simply some administrative powers. </p><p>(Note: Wimalaratana expressed deep annoyance over a </p><p>June 8 incident in Japan when several Sri Lankan men </p><p>interrupted a Buddhist ceremony attended by the PM.  The </p><p>men were arrested by Japanese authorities.  He said the </p><p>disruption was most inappropriate.  Despite reports to </p><p>the contrary, the radical, anti-GSL Janantha Vimukthi </p><p>Peramuna has denied involvement in the incident.) </p><p>(Note:  For comments from the president\'s office re the </p><p>PM\'s speech please see Para 7.) </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>Tigers are Quiet, so far </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) The LTTE has not issued a public reaction to the </p><p>Tokyo conference as of yet.  Pararajasingham, who is </p><p>quite close to the Tigers, told us that he was not sure </p><p>when or if the group would formally make a statement. </p><p>He said he thought the group might forestall any public </p><p>reaction until the government developed a proposal fully </p><p>sketching out its idea for an interim structure in the </p><p>north and east.  He added, however, that it was possible </p><p>that Anton Balasingham, the LTTE\'s London-based </p><p>spokesman, might use "TamilNet" to make some sort of </p><p>announcement re the outcome of the conference before </p><p>that. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>No Reaction yet from the President </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) President Kumaratunga and her People\'s Alliance </p><p>(PA) party have also avoided publicly discussing Tokyo </p><p>thus far.  (Note:  The president shares a very tense </p><p>cohabitation relationship with the PM.)  Presidential </p><p>advisor Eric Fernando told us that the president has </p><p>been in Kandy of late and had only returned to Colombo </p><p>last night (June 9).  He was not sure when or if she </p><p>might comment on Tokyo.  Fernando went on to say that he </p><p>felt that the prime minister\'s speech yielded "nothing </p><p>new."  He added that former foreign minister Lakshman </p><p>Kadirgamar, probably the president\'s closest advisor, </p><p>felt the same way.  Fernando remarked that the president </p><p>had proposed a similar interim structure concept way </p><p>back in August 2000 and it was by now an old idea. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  Despite the absence of the Tigers, the Tokyo </p><p>conference clearly went a long way toward restoring some </p><p>of the peace process\' lost momentum.  The attention </p><p>given to Sri Lanka by such well-known international </p><p>actors as the U.S. (through Deputy Secretary Armitage) </p><p>and Japan (through Prime Minister Koizumi) has been </p><p>noted and deeply appreciated.  Moreover, Sri Lankans </p><p>have welcomed the large-scale assistance pledges, </p><p>especially the astronomical USD one billion announced by </p><p>Japan, and also the U.S.\' and EU\'s generous amounts.  At </p><p>this point, the question is whether the Tigers will come </p><p>back to the peace talks in the aftermath of the </p><p>conference.  The answer to whether the LTTE wants to </p><p>return to the ballgame remains very unclear.  As of this </p><p>time, however, there is little indication that the group </p><p>is rethinking its recent hard-line posture.  The </p><p>conference, however, is just wrapping up and perhaps the </p><p>good vibrations emanating from Tokyo will spur the group </p><p>to a change of heart.   END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>AMSELEM </p><p></p></div>
