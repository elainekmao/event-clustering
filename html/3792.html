HANOI 2148  B.  FBIS SEP200209000081 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) SUMMARY.  SINCE THE CONCLUSION OF THE NINTH ROUND </p><p>OF BILATERAL BOUNDARY TALKS WITH THE PRC ON AUGUST 23, THE </p><p>GVN HAS ENGAGED IN A PUBLIC RELATIONS BLITZ, INCLUDING THE </p><p>APPARENTLY UNPRECEDENTED PUBLICATION OF THE 1999 LAND BORDER </p><p>TREATY ON THE INTERNET, TO COUNTER PERSISTENT DOMESTIC </p><p>CRITICISM THAT IT MADE TOO MANY CONCESSIONS TO THE PRC IN </p><p>CONCLUDING THAT TREATY.  THE TWO SIDES ALSO DISCUSSED THE </p><p>TONKIN GULF AND SOUTH CHINA SEA AT THE BOUNDARY TALKS.  THE </p><p>2000 BILATERAL AGREEMENT ON THE TONKIN GULF HAS YET TO BE </p><p>RATIFIED BY EITHER SIDE.  THE GVN\'S AWKWARD HANDLING OF THIS </p><p>ISSUE IS UNLIKELY TO PLACATE THE TREATY\'S CRITICS.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>LAND BORDER - DID THE GVN GIVE AWAY TOO MUCH? </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  THE PRC AND VIETNAM SHARE A COMMON LAND BORDER OF </p><p>ABOUT 1,375 KILOMETERS.  AMID CONSIDERABLE FANFARE, THE TWO </p><p>COUNTRIES SIGNED A LAND BORDER TREATY ON THE LAST DAY OF </p><p>1999.  VIETNAM\'S NATIONAL ASSEMBLY AND THE PRC\'S NATIONAL </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02309  01 OF 02  240942Z </p><p>PEOPLE\'S CONGRESS RATIFIED THE TREATY THE FOLLOWING YEAR. </p><p>DESPITE A STATED GOAL TO PLANT 1,500 BORDER MARKERS OVER THE </p><p>FOLLOWING THREE YEARS, ONLY FOUR HAVE YET BEEN PUT IN PLACE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  THE GVN AND COMMUNIST PARTY OF VIETNAM (CPV) </p><p>(ESPECIALLY FORMER CPV GENERAL SECRETARY LE KHA PHIEU) HAVE </p><p>FACED CONSIDERABLE CRITICISM OVER THE TREATY, MAINLY FROM </p><p>OVERSEAS VIETNAMESE, BUT ALSO FROM SOME DEMOCRATIC ACTIVISTS </p><p>INSIDE VIETNAM.  REF A PROVIDES TEXT OF A LETTER SENT ON </p><p>AUGUST 1 BY 20 PROMINENT DISSIDENTS, INCLUDING FORMER PARTY </p><p>MEMBERS AND MILITARY VETERANS, TO THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY </p><p>CALLING FOR THE GVN TO PUBLISH THE TREATY, ALONG WITH CALLS </p><p>FOR MORE DEMOCRACY AND EFFORTS AGAINST CORRUPTION. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  PUBLIC CRITICISM HAS FOCUSED ON THE AMOUNT OF </p><p>LAND CEDED TO THE PRC.  IN A MEETING WITH POLOFF ON </p><p>SEPTEMBER 19, MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS (MFA) CHINA DESK </p><p>DIRECTOR TRAN DUY HAI DISAGREED WITH THIS CLAIM, STRESSING </p><p>THAT "BOTH SIDES AGREED TO SPLIT THE DISPUTED AREAS ABOUT </p><p>EVENLY."  HE CLAIMED THAT THE CRITICISM OF THE TREATY WAS </p><p>COMING FROM "HOSTILE ELEMENTS TRYING TO SUBVERT THE </p><p>AGREEMENT." </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  THE INSTITUTE OF CHINA STUDIES\' DR. NGUYEN HUY </p><p>QUY SAID SEPARATELY THAT THE CRITICISM IS MOTIVATED BY A </p><p>COMBINATION OF CONCERN FOR THE NATIONAL INTEREST AND FROM </p><p>OTHERS, "MOSTLY FROM ABROAD," WHO GENERALLY OPPOSE THE SRV. </p><p>DR. QUY ADMITTED THAT HE HAD BEEN "SURPRISED" BY THE EXTENT </p><p>OF INTERNAL CRITICISM, BECAUSE "IT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO </p><p>EXPRESS THIS TYPE OF DISSENT INSIDE THE COUNTRY."  HE OPINED </p><p>THAT THE TREATY NONETHELESS REPRESENTED A "REASONABLE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02309  01 OF 02  240942Z </p><p>COMPROMISE" AND SHOULD SERVE TO FACILITATE BUSINESS AND </p><p>POLITICAL CONTACTS IN THE FUTURE. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>READ IT ON THE WEB </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  STARTING AROUND THE BEGINNING OF SEPTEMBER, THE </p><p>STATE-CONTROLLED MEDIA BEGAN A VIGOROUS CAMPAIGN TO DEFEND </p><p>THE LAND BORDER TREATY.  VIETNAM TELEVISION FEATURED A LONG </p><p>INTERVIEW WITH VICE FOREIGN MINISTER LE CONG PHUNG, THE </p><p>OFFICIAL IN CHARGE OF THESE BORDER ISSUES AND SOUTHEAST </p><p>ASIA.  IN ADDITION, AN INTERVIEW WITH PHUNG APPEARED IN THE </p><p>PRINT MEDIA (REF B), ALONG WITH NUMEROUS OTHER ARTICLES </p><p>DESCRIBING THE "POSITIVE" ASPECTS OF THE TREATY.  IN AN </p><p>APPARENTLY UNPRECEDENTED MOVE, THE GVN ALSO ALLOWED THE </p><p>CPV\'S FLAGSTAFF NEWSPAPER "NHAN DAN" (PEOPLE\'S DAILY) TO </p><p>PUBLISH THE TEXT OF THE TREATY ON ITS VIETNAMESE LANGUAGE </p><p>WEBSITE.  (FBIS PLANS TO TRANSLATE THIS TEXT IN THE NEAR </p><p>FUTURE.)  THE MFA\'S HAI SAID THE REASON FOR DOING THIS WAS </p><p>TO COUNTER "DISINFORMATION COMING FROM OVERSEAS" AND TO SHOW </p><p>THE VIETNAMESE PEOPLE THAT "THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOTHING TO </p><p>HIDE." </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ2613 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HANOI  02309  02 OF 02  240942Z </p><p>ACTION EAP-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AIT-03   CIAE-00  C-00     DINT-00  DOEE-00 </p><p>      DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    FAAE-00  FBIE-00  UTED-00 </p><p>      VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   L-00     VCE-00   MOFM-05 </p><p>      MOF-01   AC-01    NSAE-00  OMB-01   PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00 </p><p>      ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    SS-00    TEST-00  TRSE-00  T-00 </p><p>      USIE-00  EPAE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-02   G-00 </p><p>      NFAT-00  SAS-00     /014W </p><p>                  ------------------EBE2BE  240943Z /38 </p><p>R 240929Z SEP 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HANOI </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 7614 </p><p>INFO AMCONSUL HO CHI MINH CITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY BEIJING </p><p>AMCONSUL CHENGDU </p><p>AMCONSUL GUANGZHOU </p><p>AMCONSUL SHANGHAI </p><p>AMCONSUL SHENYANG </p><p>AMCONSUL HONG KONG </p><p>AIT TAIPEI 0705 </p><p>ASEAN COLLECTIVE </p><p>USCINCPAC HONOLULU HI </p><p>NSC WASHDC </p><p>SECDEF WASHDC//ISA/ACHAO// </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 02 HANOI 002309 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  02309  02 OF 02  240942Z </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV, EAP/CM, INR/EAP/SEA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  ACCORDING TO A SEPTEMBER 16 MFA PRESS RELEASE AND </p><p>OTHER PRESS REPORTS, OVER THE COURSE OF THE TREATY </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS THE TWO SIDES COMPARED THEIR RESPECTIVE MAPS </p><p>AND FOUND THAT THERE WERE ABOUT 227 SQUARE KILOMETERS IN </p><p>DISPUTE.  VIETNAM AND THE PRC AGREED TO SPLIT THE DIFFERENCE </p><p>ABOUT EVENLY - 113 SQUARE KILOMETERS TO VIETNAM AND 114 </p><p>SQUARE KILOMETERS TO THE PRC.  THIS PROCEDURE WAS DESCRIBED </p><p>IN A SEPARATE MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING THAT BECAME PART </p><p>OF THE 1999 TREATY. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>SEA ISSUES REMAIN OPEN </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU)  DURING THE AUGUST 2002 BORDER TALKS, THE TWO </p><p>SIDES CONTINUED DISCUSSION OF SEA BORDER ISSUES.  WHILE THE </p><p>TWO SIDES SIGNED AN ACCORD IN DECEMBER 2000 SETTING OUT </p><p>TONKIN GULF SEA BORDERS, THIS TREATY HAS NOT YET BEEN </p><p>RATIFIED BY EITHER SIDE.  THE MFA\'S HAI SAID "TECHNICAL </p><p>ISSUES" REMAIN CONCERNING BOTH THE GULF OF TONKIN AND THE </p><p>FISHERIES AGREEMENTS.  THESE CENTER AROUND MARITIME </p><p>DEMARCATION AS WELL AS THE NUMBER AND SIZE OF FISHING </p><p>VESSELS ALLOWED IN THE COMMON FISHING GROUND.  ACCORDING TO </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02309  02 OF 02  240942Z </p><p>HAI, THE TWO SIDES HAVE AGREED TO WORK ON THE TECHNICAL </p><p>ISSUES IN ORDER TO "SPEED UP IMPLEMENTATION."

(SBU)   VIETNAM\'S OBSESSION WITH CHINA STEMS BOTH FROM </p><p>HISTORICAL AND CONTEMPORARY FACTORS.  THE GVN\'S AWKWARD </p><p>HANDLING OF THE BORDER AGREEMENT -- FIRST, ITS APPARENT </p><p>RELUCTANCE TO SHARE INFORMATION AT THE TIME OF THE SIGNING </p><p>AND THE RATIFICATION, AND LATER THIS BELATED EFFORT TO </p><p>DEMONSTRATE HOW "NORMAL" AND BENEFICIAL THE AGREEMENT IS -- </p><p>IS AN INDICATION BOTH OF THE SECRETIVE NATURE OF MOST </p><p>DECISION-MAKING IN VIETNAM AND THE SENSITIVITY ABOUT PUBLIC </p><p>PERCEPTIONS OF CAVING IN TO ITS LARGE NORTHERN NEIGHBOR. </p><p>EMBASSY DOUBTS THAT THIS LATEST PUBLIC RELATIONS CAMPAIGN </p><p>WILL SATISFY CRITICS OF THE TREATY, AND EXPECTS ACTIVISTS </p><p>INSIDE AND OUTSIDE VIETNAM TO CONTINUE TO NEEDLE THE GVN ON </p><p>THIS ISSUE. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
