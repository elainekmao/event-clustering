<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ROME 005849 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/04/2012 </p><p>TAGS: MARR, PREL, UP, MASS, PREL, UP, MASS, IT, ITMARR </p><p>SUBJECT: UKRAINE - GOI TELLS KUCHMA TO SHAPE UP; WANTS TO </p><p>KEEP LINES OF COMMUNICATION OPEN </p><p> </p><p>REF: ROME 4912 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: POLITICAL MINISTER-COUNSELOR TOM COUNTRYMAN </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  SUMMARY:  ON DECEMBER 2, RUSSIA/FSU OFFICE DIRECTOR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  05849  01 OF 02  041727Z </p><p>ROSA ANNA CONIGLIO TOLD POLOFF THAT THE NOVEMBER 26/27 VISIT </p><p>OF UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT KUCHMA TO ITALY WAS CONSIDERED BY THE </p><p>GOI TO HAVE BEEN A "GREAT SUCCESS."   KUCHMA HEARD A STRONG </p><p>MESSAGE FROM ALL HIS ITALIAN INTERLOCUTORS ON THE KOLCHUGA </p><p>RADAR ISSUE AND THE GENERAL NEGATIVE UKRAINIAN PERFORMANCE ON </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS.  AT THE SAME TIME, LINES OF COMMUNICATION TO </p><p>THE GOU WERE KEPT OPEN, AND ITALY MADE PROGRESS WITH UKRAINE </p><p>ON A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT BILATERAL ISSUES, SUCH AS ADOPTIONS </p><p>AND BUSINESS TAXATION ISSUES.  THE GOI HAS OFFERED ITS </p><p>SERVICES TO THE U.S. AS A MEDIATOR AND MESSAGE CARRIER TO THE </p><p>GOU SHOULD WE DEEM IT USEFUL.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  CONIGLIO STARTED OFF WITH AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT THAT THE </p><p>TIMING OF THE VISIT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN WORSE, GIVEN THE </p><p>KOLCHUGA RADAR ISSUE AND NATO/OSCE/EU ATTEMPTS TO ISOLATE </p><p>KUCHMA.  HOWEVER, SHE CONTINUED, WHILE KUCHMA\'S TRIP WAS </p><p>DOWNGRADED TO AN "OFFICIAL VISIT," IT WAS ORIGINALLY PLANNED </p><p>AS A STATE VISIT IN THE BEGINNING OF 2001.  PRESIDENT </p><p>CIAMPI\'S AGENDA IS GENERALLY PLANNED TWO YEARS IN ADVANCE, </p><p>PARTICULARLY FOR STATE VISITS.  THE GOI DECIDED TO GO AHEAD </p><p>WITH THE VISIT BECAUSE IT HEARD NO OBJECTIONS FROM ALLIES AND </p><p>THOUGHT THAT SOME GOOD COULD COME FROM DIALOGUE WITH KUCHMA. </p><p>THERE HAD ALSO BEEN TWO STATE VISITS TO UKRAINE BY ITALIAN </p><p>PRESIDENTS SINCE UKRAINIAN INDEPENDENCE FROM THE SOVIET UNION </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  POLOFF ASSURED CONIGLIO THAT THE PRESS REPORTS </p><p>(PARTICULARLY ITALIAN MEDIA) JUST PRIOR TO THE VISIT IMPLYING </p><p>THAT THE GOI WAS THUMBING ITS NOSE AT THE ALLIES, ESPECIALLY </p><p>THE U.S., BY HOSTING KUCHMA HAD NO USG SOURCE.  CONIGLIO WAS </p><p>ALREADY AWARE THAT EMBASSY ROME HAD ASKED WASHINGTON SOME </p><p>WEEKS PRIOR TO THE TRIP (REFTEL) WHETHER THE USG WANTED THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  05849  01 OF 02  041727Z </p><p>TRIP CANCELED.  THE SPECIFIC POINTS WE HAD RECEIVED IN THE </p><p>RESPONSE TO THE REQUEST HAD BEEN PASSED TO THE PRESIDENT\'S </p><p>OFFICE, AND HAD BEEN MADE PART OF CIAMPI\'S AND PM </p><p>BERLUSCONI\'S TALKING POINTS.  CONIGLIO WAS RELIEVED TO HEAR </p><p>THAT OUR OFFICIAL PUBLIC LINE, IF ASKED, WAS THAT THE USG </p><p>KNEW ABOUT THE VISIT AND RAISED NO OBJECTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  CONIGLIO SAID THAT IN ADDITION TO DOWNGRADING THE </p><p>VISIT STATUS, THE GOI MADE CLEAR TO KUCHMA ITS DISPLEASURE </p><p>WITH HIS REGIME\'S ACTIVITIES BY POSTPONING A SIGNING CEREMONY </p><p>FOR A NUMBER OF BILATERAL AGREEMENTS.  THE GOVERNMENTS HAD </p><p>REACHED CLOSURE ON LANGUAGE FOR THE AGREEMENTS DURING THE </p><p>VISIT, AND ITALY WILL EVENTUALLY SIGN BECAUSE THEY ARE </p><p>IMPORTANT TO ITALIAN NATIONAL INTERESTS. HOWEVER, THERE WILL </p><p>BE NO CEREMONY - THE ITALIAN AMBASSADOR IN KIEV WILL SIGN THE </p><p>AGREEMENTS.  THE AGREEMENTS INCLUDE REGULATIONS ON ADOPTIONS </p><p>OF UKRAINIAN CHILDREN BY ITALIAN PARENTS, AND REFORM OF </p><p>DOUBLE-TAXATION LAWS PENALIZING SMALL/MEDIUM ITALIAN </p><p>ENTERPRISES DOING BUSINESS IN UKRAINE. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  KUCHMA MET WITH PRESIDENT CIAMPI, PM BERLUSCONI, </p><p>SENATE PRESIDENT PERA AND CENTRAL BANK GOVERNOR FAZIO.  FM </p><p>FRATTINI MET SEPARATELY WITH FM ZLENKO.  ACCORDING TO </p><p>CONIGLIO, KUCHMA HEARD FROM ALL OF HIS INTERLOCUTORS THE </p><p>FOLLOWING:  YOU MUST DISCLOSE, NOW, ALL OF THE FACTS </p><p>REGARDING SALES/SHIPMENTS OF KOLCHUGA RADAR SYSTEMS, AND; YOU </p><p>SAY YOU WANT CLOSER INTEGRATION OF UKRAINE WITH THE REST OF </p><p>EUROPE, SO BACK UP YOUR WORDS WITH DEEDS.  PM BERLUSCONI </p><p>EMPHASIZED TO KUCHMA THAT WHILE THERE HAD BEEN SOME PROGRESS, </p><p>OVERALL KIEV\'S RECORD ON IMPLEMENTATION OF COMMITMENTS TO </p><p>INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS, MEDIA FREEDOM, AND TREATMENT OF </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  05849  01 OF 02  041727Z </p><p>OPPOSITION POLITICAL PARTIES WAS ABYSMAL, AND NOT </p><p>CHARACTERISTIC OF A REPRESENTATIONAL DEMOCRACY. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  CONIGLIO SAID THAT THROUGHOUT HIS VISIT AND WITH ALL </p><p>HIS INTERLOCUTORS, KUCHMA DENIED KNOWING ANYTHING ABOUT </p><p>KOLCHUGA SALES TO IRAQ, AND SAID THAT THE RECORDINGS WERE A </p><p>FABRICATION COMPOSED OF OTHER SPLICED TAPES.  FURTHER, </p><p>CONTINUED KUCHMA, THESE SUSPECT TAPES WERE THE ONLY EVIDENCE </p><p>AGAINST HIM.  KUCHMA SAID THAT UKRAINE HAD SOLD SOME SYSTEMS </p><p>TO RUSSIA PRIOR TO 2000 AND TO CHINA IN 2002, BUT HE COULDN\'T </p><p>SAY WHERE THE SYSTEMS ARE NOW.  "YOU\'LL HAVE TO ASK THE </p><p>BUYERS, WE CAN\'T TELL YOU" KUCHMA TOLD BERLUSCONI AND CIAMPI. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  KUCHMA TOLD BERLUSCONI THAT "RICH, PRIVATE </p><p>BUSINESSMEN OWNED 90 PERCENT OF THE MEDIA" AND THAT THEREFORE </p><p>THERE COULD BE NO GOVERNMENT INFLUENCE.  HE ALSO COMPLAINED </p><p>THAT HE WAS NOT SATISFIED WITH UKRAINE\'S POLITICAL SYSTEM, </p><p>SINCE THE PARLIAMENT BLOCKED MANY OF HIS ADMINISTRATION\'S </p><p>INITIATIVES, AND THEREFORE LITTLE WAS ACCOMPLISHED.  KUCHMA </p><p>TOLD PERA THAT HE WANTED TO RESTRUCTURE THE GOU INTO A </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY SYSTEM SIMILAR TO ITALY\'S.  PERA AND KUCHMA </p><p>AGREED TO AN "EXCHANGE OF EXPERTS" ON PARLIAMENTARY SYSTEMS </p><p>TO STUDY POSSIBLE REFORMS IN KIEV. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  CONIGLIO SAID THAT DURING HIS MEETING WITH FAZIO, </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ6116 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  05849  02 OF 02  041727Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  INL-00   DODE-00 </p><p>      DOEE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EAP-00   EB-00    FBIE-00  VC-00 </p><p>      H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   M-00 </p><p>      AC-01    NSAE-00  OMB-01   PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00 </p><p>      P-00     SCT-00   SP-00    SSO-00   SS-00    TRSE-00  T-00 </p><p>      USIE-00  SA-00    DTC-00   PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-02 </p><p>      G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /006W </p><p>                  ------------------12A83B  041728Z /38 </p><p>O 041554Z DEC 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO AMEMBASSY KIEV IMMEDIATE </p><p>SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 7205 </p><p>INFO EUROPEAN POLITICAL COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p>NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 ROME 005849 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/04/2012 </p><p>TAGS: MARR, PREL, UP, MASS, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: UKRAINE - GOI TELLS KUCHMA TO SHAPE UP; WANTS TO </p><p>KEEP LINES OF COMMUNICATION OPEN </p><p> </p><p>KUCHMA COMPLAINED THAT  THE UKRAINE CENTRAL BANK WAS CREATED </p><p>DURING THE SOVIET ERA AND STILL OPERATED ON THAT DESIGN. </p><p>KUCHMA ASKED FOR, AND FAZIO AGREED TO PROVIDE, ASSISTANCE TO </p><p>REFORM THE BANKING SYSTEM, TO INCLUDE FRAUD DETECTION AND </p><p>PROTECTIONS AGAINST MONEY LAUNDERING.  CONIGLIO SPECULATED </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  05849  02 OF 02  041727Z </p><p>THAT KUCHMA, WELL AWARE OF SIMILAR REFORMS UNDERWAY IN </p><p>RUSSIA, DID NOT WANT KIEV TO FALL TOO FAR BEHIND MOSCOW IN </p><p>THE EYES OF THE WTO, IMF, ETC. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  CONIGLIO SAID THAT THE GOI\'S VIEW WAS THAT THERE </p><p>WERE SUFFICIENT SIGNS OF REFORM IN UKRAINE TO WARRANT </p><p>CONTINUING COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN ROME AND KIEV.  IN ADDITION </p><p>TO THE INITIATIVES DESCRIBED ABOVE, CONIGLIO OFFERED THE </p><p>GOI\'S SERVICES AS MEDIATOR AND MESSAGE COURIER BETWEEN THE </p><p>U.S. AND UKRAINE SHOULD WE THINK IT APPROPRIATE. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C)  COMMENT:  THE GOI HAS ASSUMED THE ROLE OF </p><p>INTERMEDIARY BEFORE, MOST RECENTLY CARRYING OUR MESSAGES TO </p><p>PUTIN THROUGH BERLUSCONI ON IRAN DUAL-USE TECHNOLOGY </p><p>TRANSFER.  IT SEEMS TO BE A ROLE BERLUSCONI ENJOYS AND ONE </p><p>THAT POST RECOMMENDS WE HOLD IN RESERVE SHOULD WE WANT OUR </p><p>OWN MESSAGES REINFORCED WITH THE GOU, OR THE POLITICAL </p><p>SITUATION IN KIEV DETERIORATES TO THE POINT WHERE WE WOULD </p><p>FIND IT MORE PRODUCTIVE TO TAKE BERLUSCONI UP ON HIS OFFER. </p><p> </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME05849 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
