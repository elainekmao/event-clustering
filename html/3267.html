<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 001326 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/07/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PTER, NP, CH </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL\'S KING JOURNEYS TO CHINA SEEKING HELP IN </p><p>TIME OF CRISIS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. KATHMANDU 1314 </p><p> </p><p>     B. KATHMANDU 953 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Michael E. Malinowski, Reasons 1.5(b),(d) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary.  Statements against Nepal\'s Maoist insurgents </p><p>and "anti-China activities" can be expected during the first </p><p>visit of Nepal\'s King Gyanendra to China.  A leading Nepali </p><p>business leader accompanying the monarch hopes to strike </p><p>deals that will help reduce Nepal\'s sizable trade deficit </p><p>with China.  In recent weeks new Sino-Nepalese accords on </p><p>travel and foreign exchange have taken effect.  Gyanendra </p><p>will likely press for additional aid and work to reassure </p><p>Beijing that stability can be reestablished quickly in his </p><p>country.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Nepal\'s New King to Beijing </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Nepal\'s King Gyanendra Bir Bikram Shah travels to </p><p>Beijing July 9 on a state visit hosted by Chinese President </p><p>Jiang Zemin.  It will be only his second visit abroad since </p><p>becoming King thirteen months ago; he returned from his </p><p>first, to India, June 28 (Ref A).  (Note:  Gyanendra\'s </p><p>brother, the late King Birendra, paid three official visits </p><p>to China, the last time in early 2001 just three months </p><p>before his death.  Birendra also toured China unofficially on </p><p>seven other occasions.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) The King will keep a busy schedule according to </p><p>reports in Nepal\'s official press, stopping first in Beijing </p><p>for meetings and to visit "science and technological </p><p>centers."  Gyanendra departs the PRC from Shanghai July 15. </p><p>In between, Nepal\'s monarch plans to travel to the </p><p>northeastern city of Dalian--stopping at the Dalian Mounted </p><p>Policewoman Training Base--and to the Three Gorges Dam site </p><p>in central Hubei Province. </p><p> </p><p>Focus on Maoists and Other "Bad Elements" </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) As he did in Delhi, Gyanendra will try to assure his </p><p>Chinese hosts that Nepal has made strides in its campaign </p><p>against the Maoist insurgents.  China\'s Ambassador to Nepal </p><p>Wu Congyong has made strong statements against the </p><p>"anti-government" Maoists--singling out their misleading use </p><p>of Chairman Mao\'s name (Ref B)--and similar rhetoric can be </p><p>expected from Beijing.  Gyanendra will likely reiterate to </p><p>the Chinese his previous statements against "anti-China </p><p>activities" in Nepal.  Meeting with a visiting Chinese </p><p>military delegation in September 2001, Gyanendra stated he </p><p>"would not allow anti-China activities to be conducted within </p><p>Nepalese territory."  He repeated this statement during an </p><p>April meeting with a delegation of leaders from the Tibet </p><p>Autonomous Region. </p><p> </p><p>Nepal Hopes for Economic Benefits </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) Sharat Singh Bhandari, Nepal\'s Health Minister, and </p><p>Ravi Bhanta Shrestha, President of the Federation of Nepalese </p><p>Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FNCCI), will accompany the </p><p>King to China.  Shrestha told us that he plans to meet with </p><p>his counterpart from the All-China Federation of Industry and </p><p>Commerce (ACFIC); the two organizations will sign a </p><p>memorandum of understanding "to promote mutual cooperation." </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Nepal currently runs a USD 150 million trade deficit </p><p>with China, and Shrestha hopes that gap can be closed.  China </p><p>has offered to build new roads to promote cross-border trade, </p><p>including one through the former kingdom of Lo Monthang in </p><p>Mustang (on Nepal\'s northern border) and another leading </p><p>northwest out of Kathmandu.  (Note:  A new road from the </p><p>Tibet border to Lo Monthang--built by Nepali villagers with </p><p>local funds--has already increased cross-border trade </p><p>dramatically in the region.  Romi Gauchan, Member of </p><p>Parliament for Mustang, told us recently that the road acts </p><p>as a substitute for supply lines leading from south Nepal </p><p>made impracticable by the Maoist insurgency.  End Note.)  A </p><p>lack of port facilities and exportable products will continue </p><p>to disadvantage Nepal, however.  At present, nearly 98 </p><p>percent of Nepal\'s exports to China enter the country by land </p><p>through Tibet, while slightly less than half of Chinese goods </p><p>entering Nepal come via Tibet. </p><p>Tourism, Foreign Exchange Accords Take Effect </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) In China the King and his hosts will likely highlight </p><p>the memoranda of understanding on tourism and Yuan </p><p>convertibility that were signed by Nepal and China in recent </p><p>months and have already taken effect.  Nepal agreed to permit </p><p>Chinese travel agencies to bring Chinese tourists into the </p><p>country while China designated Nepal as an authorized </p><p>destination for Chinese tourists as of June 1.  Then in </p><p>mid-June the two countries\' central banks agreed to accept </p><p>Chinese currency into their bilateral bank settlement system. </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>8. (C) In New Delhi the King worked hard to reassure the GOI </p><p>of his commitment to constitutional democracy and pressed the </p><p>Indians for help fighting the Maoists.  Gyanendra will likely </p><p>ask for China\'s support too, but at the same time try to </p><p>reassure them that stability can be restored in Nepal at an </p><p>early date. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
