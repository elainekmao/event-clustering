<p>UNCLAS HO CHI MINH CITY 001345 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV (THORIN/LANGLAND); PASS TO USTR FOR </p><p>ELENA BRYAN AND CAROYL MILLER </p><p>USDOC FOR 3132/OIO/EAP/KELLEHER </p><p>USDOC FOR 1431/MAC/AP/HPPHO </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, KTEX, PREL, VM, BTA </p><p>SUBJECT: ON THE EVE OF DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER DZUNG\'S VISIT: VINATEX HAS HIGH HOPES FOR THE U.S. MARKET </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  SUMMARY:  THE VIETNAM TEXTILE INDUSTRY\'S PUSH TO </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HO CHI  01345  291026Z </p><p>ENTER THE U.S. MARKET HAS ALREADY BEGUN, ACCORDING TO </p><p>MR. LE QUOC AN, HEAD OF VIETNAM\'S STATE-OWNED TEXTILE </p><p>ENTERPRISES (VINATEX), AND CHAIRMAN OF THE NATIONAL </p><p>TEXTILE MANUFACTURERS\' ASSOCIATION (VITAS).  AN WILL </p><p>ACCOMPANY DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER DZUNG\'S OFFICIAL </p><p>DELEGATION TO THE U.S. NEXT MONTH.  DURING HIS TIME </p><p>THERE, AN WILL FORMALLY OPEN A VINATEX OFFICE IN NEW </p><p>YORK CITY, AS WELL AS SCOUT LOCATIONS FOR A VITAS </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE OFFICE IN LOS ANGELES.  HE PLANS CALLS </p><p>ON SEVERAL AMERICAN CLOTHING RETAILERS, AND SAID HIS </p><p>"DREAM TRIP" WOULD BE ONE THAT RESULTED IN CONTRACTS </p><p>FOR VINATEX.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  ON NOVEMBER 23, THE VIETNAM TEXTILE AND APPAREL </p><p>ASSOCIATION (VITAS) AND ITS CHAIRMAN, MR. LE QUOC AN, </p><p>HOSTED A DINNER TO INTRODUCE THE TEXTILE INDUSTRY, </p><p>WHICH HAS HIGH EXPECTATIONS FOR THE U.S. MARKET.  AN </p><p>ALSO HEADS VINATEX, A STATE-OWNED CORPORATION </p><p>CONTROLLING 60 TEXTILE AND GARMENT COMPANIES IN WHICH </p><p>THE GVN HOLDS A MAJORITY STAKE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  AN WILL TRAVEL TO THE U.S. AS PART OF THE OFFICIAL </p><p>BUSINESS DELEGATION ACCOMPANYING DEPUTY PM DZUNG IN </p><p>DECEMBER, FOR THE EXCHANGE OF LETTERS IMPLEMENTING THE </p><p>BILATERAL TRADE AGREEMENT (BTA).  AN WANTS THE VISIT TO </p><p>BE MUCH MORE THAN SYMBOLIC.  WHILE IN THE U.S., HE WILL </p><p>OFFICIALLY OPEN A VINATEX REPRESENTATIVE OFFICE </p><p>(ALREADY UP AND RUNNING) IN NEW YORK CITY\'S GARMENT </p><p>DISTRICT.  IN LOS ANGELES, HE WILL SCOUT LOCATIONS TO </p><p>ESTABLISH A REPRESENTATIVE OFFICE FOR VITAS.  AN WILL </p><p>ALSO MEET WITH U.S. CLOTHING RETAILERS -- INCLUDING THE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HO CHI  01345  291026Z </p><p>GAP, THE LIMITED, AND SEARS. THOUGH HE CHARACTERIZED </p><p>THE CALLS AS INTRODUCTORY, HE HOPES VINATEX CAN WALK </p><p>AWAY WITH CONTRACTS FROM THIS TRIP. </p><p>AN SAID VINATEX EVENTUALLY WANTS TO COMPETE IN THE </p><p>AMERICAN MARKET WITH HIGH-END PRODUCTS, FOR NOW THEY </p><p>WILL FOCUS ON MID-RANGE, READY-TO-WEAR APPAREL. </p><p> </p><p>4.  VINATEX AND THE GVN EXPECT THE GARMENT INDUSTRY TO </p><p>BENEFIT QUICKLY FROM THE BTA, WITH TARIFFS FALLING TO </p><p>AS LOW AS 5 TO 6 PERCENT FROM THE CURRENT 45 TO 50 </p><p>PERCENT.  LOCAL NEWS REPORTS STATE THAT THE GVN EXPECTS </p><p>GARMENT EXPORTS TO THE U.S. TO REACH US$200 MILLION IN </p><p>2002.  THIS YEAR THEY SHOULD REACH US$50 MILLION, WITH </p><p>US$17 MILLION COMING FROM VINATEX ALONE. </p><p> </p><p>5.  ALSO AT THE DINNER WAS POPULAR FASHION DESIGNER MS. </p><p>MINH HANH, WHO STARTED WITH VINATEX, BUT NOW OPERATES </p><p>HER OWN BOUTIQUE AND WORKSHOP. SHE JOKINGLY - BUT </p><p>POINTEDLY - REMARKED THAT STATE ENTERPRISES DO "NOT PAY </p><p>LIVING WAGES," WHICH WAS WHY SHE BRANCHED OUT INTO </p><p>PRIVATE ENTERPRISE.  PLUS, SHE WANTED MORE QUALITY </p><p>CONTROL OVER HER DESIGNS.  SHE STILL DOES SOME WORK FOR </p><p>VINATEX, BUT KEEPS THE MORE SOPHISTICATED FASHIONS FOR </p><p>HER OTHER CLIENTS.  MS. SAO KIM, DEPUTY EDITOR FOR </p><p>"MOT" FASHION MAGAZINE, AGREED WITH MINH HANH\'S </p><p>CRITICISMS OF QUALITY CONTROL AND LOW SALARIES. </p><p> </p><p>6.  COMMENT:  VIETNAM\'S TEXTILE INDUSTRY -- </p><p>CONCENTRATED PRIMARILY IN THE SOUTH -- HAS MOVED </p><p>AGGRESSIVELY TO PREPARE FOR BTA IMPLEMENTATION. VINATEX </p><p>AND OTHER LOCAL COMPANIES ARE LOOKING FOR NEW BUSINESS </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HO CHI  01345  291026Z </p><p>- AND FAST.  AN REPEATEDLY STRESSED THAT AS PART OF THE </p><p>VIETNAMESE DELEGATION, HE WOULD "REPRESENT ALL </p><p>GARMENT/TEXTILE MANUFACTURERS, NOT JUST THE STATE-OWNED </p><p>ENTERPRISES."  IF - AND IT IS A BIG IF - THE VIETNAMESE </p><p>GARMENT INDUSTRY CAN MEET THE QUALITY EXPECTATIONS OF </p><p>AMERICAN BUYERS, THEN IT DOES APPEAR READY TO TAKE OFF </p><p>UNDER THE BTA.  END COMMENT.   YAMAUCHI </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
