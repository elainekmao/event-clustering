<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 001527 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA; LONDON FOR REIDEL; NSC FOR MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/20/2012 </p><p>TAGS: CE, PGOV, PINR, PINS, PREL, PTER, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT: MORAGODA ON MEETING LTTE IN OSLO: GUARDED OPTIMISM </p><p>RETURNS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. OSLO 1742 </p><p>     B. OSLO 1846 </p><p>     C. COLOMBO 1319 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador E. Ashley Wills; reasons 1.5 (b and d) </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY:  PEACE TALKS MOMENTUM </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) GSL Minister Moragoda appeared to have regained a bit </p><p>of optimism following his Oslo meeting (reftels) with LTTE </p><p>"theorist" Anton Balasingham.  Moragoda said that Balasingham </p><p>seems serious about getting talks going, is very sensitive to </p><p>US and Indian attitudes re the LTTE, and concerned about the </p><p>LTTE\'s overall international image.  According to Moragoda, </p><p>Balasingham has an understanding of GSL political </p><p>difficulties and appears willing to try not to add to them </p><p>unnecessarily.  The long-stagnant "peace process" looks to </p><p>have regained its momentum. At the same time, Moragoda </p><p>expressed concerns over Balasingham\'s health, the potentially </p><p>complicating role of Muslim political leader Rauff Hakeem, </p><p>and the Byzantine nature of Sri Lankan politics, most notably </p><p>the very strained relationship between President Kumaratunga </p><p>and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe. END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Moragoda met the Ambassador and DCM on August 19 to </p><p>provide a read-out on the "peace process" in the wake of the </p><p>PM\'s visit to Washington and Moragoda\'s meetings with </p><p>Balasingham in Europe.  Much of what Moragoda told us is </p><p>contained in reftels and we won\'t repeat.  He did, however, </p><p>relate a few noteworthy items. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Moragoda expressed a renewed sense of reserved </p><p>optimism that the long-stagnant "peace process" seems to have </p><p>picked up some steam and has begun moving in a positive </p><p>direction.  Although Moragoda thought there was confusion </p><p>within the LTTE on how exactly to proceed, he said </p><p>Balasingham seems genuine in wanting to get the talks </p><p>underway.  Balasingham told Moragoda that the LTTE was not </p><p>ready to discuss substance.  Moragoda responded by saying </p><p>that the two sides would start "in the baby pool" and proceed </p><p>later to greater depths.  For this reason, the first phase of </p><p>the talks will deal with practical issues of development and </p><p>commercial activity and will seek to establish the framework </p><p>for subsequent formal peace negotiations. Both sides are </p><p>under pressure to show the long-suffering population in the </p><p>north and east some immediate results in the development </p><p>area.  Moragoda pressed Balasingham re the Scandinavian </p><p>monitors\' reports of over fifty kidnappings/forcible </p><p>recruitments since the ceasefire.  Balasingham, while not </p><p>necessarily accepting that number as accurate, recognized </p><p>that the LTTE has a problem with cadres leaving their units </p><p>and going home; he implied that the "kidnappings" were the </p><p>LTTE\'s bringing soldiers back to their units -- he tacitly </p><p>admitted that "peace" has created a desertion problem for the </p><p>LTTE.  Balasingham promised that the LTTE would look into the </p><p>reported incidents. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Moragoda said GSL spokesman and fellow Minister G.L. </p><p>Peiris had made a mistake by announcing publicly that Muslim </p><p>politician Rauff Hakeem would form part of the GSL </p><p>negotiating team.  Moragoda said the announcement was </p><p>premature as the rest of the team has not yet been selected. </p><p>Moragoda said that Balasingham did not seem too happy about </p><p>Hakeem\'s being at the negotiations and questioned Hakeem\'s </p><p>ability to deliver Sri Lanka\'s Muslims, especially in the </p><p>East.  Moragoda acknowledged that he, too, shared those </p><p>concerns and worried about what role Hakeem would play and </p><p>how Hakeem could be handled. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Moragoda\'s greatest concern remained the complex, at </p><p>times bizarre politics of the Sinhalese south.  He said </p><p>hardliners within the PM\'s UNF coalition are determined to </p><p>bring down President Kumaratunga.  These hardliners are not </p><p>satisfied with getting a constitutional amendment passed that </p><p>would restrict the President\'s ability to dissolve parliament </p><p>-- they want Kumaratunga impeached and out of office. </p><p>Moragoda said that he and the Prime Minister recognize that </p><p>the UNF does not have the numbers to remove Kumaratunga, and </p><p>at most they will be able to pass the constitutional </p><p>amendment.  Kumaratunga, Moragoda said, will remain a force </p><p>to be reckoned with for the next three years of her term. </p><p>Given the very poor state of relations between the President </p><p>and the Prime Minister, those three years are going to be </p><p>rocky ones and could affect the peace negotiations. </p><p>Fortunately, he said, Balasingham seems to appreciate the </p><p>GSL\'s internal difficulties and vowed not to make life any </p><p>more difficult than necessary for the GSL.  The announcement </p><p>of peace talks for September reflects the LTTE\'s attempt to </p><p>help the PM.  In fact, Balasingham apparently agreed to the </p><p>September announcement without first going to Sri Lanka to </p><p>consult LTTE Supremo Prabhakaran. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Moragoda expressed serious concern over the state of </p><p>Balasingham\'s health and whether he would be able to see the </p><p>process through. Moragoda said Balasingham is the LTTE\'s eyes </p><p>and ears on the world.  Balasingham understands the </p><p>importance of the LTTE\'s cleaning up its international image </p><p>and has a healthy respect for the positions of India and </p><p>especially the U.S.  Balasingham would be hard to replace. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) COMMENT:  The negotiations are going to be tough and </p><p>Sri Lanka will undoubtedly experience some tense moments in </p><p>the months ahead, particularly if the politics of the </p><p>Sinhalese South do not stabilize.  In addition, no one knows </p><p>what exactly is going on within the LTTE and whether </p><p>Balasingham\'s more moderate stance can carry the day.  There </p><p>are no guarantees. That said, the overall state of affairs in </p><p>Sri Lanka has experienced a dramatic turn for the better over </p><p>the past few months.  Sri Lanka is a very different country </p><p>today than it was eight months ago.  If the GSL can keep the </p><p>LTTE focused on practical issues of development, money, and </p><p>patronage, even without a final political settlement in the </p><p>near future, it would be difficult (though not impossible) </p><p>for the bad old days to return. </p><p>Wills </p><p></p></div>
