<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 HANOI 001185 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EAP/BCLTV, DRL, DRL/PHD, and DRL/IRF </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  NA </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PREL, VM, HUMANR </p><p>SUBJECT:  Vietnam Human Rights Dialogue </p><p> </p><p>Ref:  STATE 123409 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  Summary:  Ambassador delivered reftel demarche to </p><p>Deputy Foreign Minister Le Van Bang on May 13 and left a </p><p>non-paper based on reftel para 12.  Ambassador stressed that </p><p>progress on issues raised at the November 2002 Human Rights </p><p>Dialogue was insufficient to schedule another dialogue, nor </p><p>did Vietnam appear to be doing enough to avoid designation </p><p>as a Country of Particular Concern (CPC).  Without progress </p><p>through the dialogue, Ambassador warned, Vietnam risked </p><p>stronger action and greater support for measures such as the </p><p>Vietnam Human Rights bill.  Although DFM Bang reaffirmed the </p><p>usefulness of the dialogue, he noted that it is a U.S. </p><p>initiative and that many in the GVN would be happy if it </p><p>ceased.  The Ambassador pointedly replied that, while the </p><p>dialogue may originally have been a U.S. initiative, it </p><p>would not be good for Vietnam or US-Vietnam relations if the </p><p>dialogue were dropped since it would only lead to greater </p><p>support for stronger action against the GVN like the VN </p><p>Human Rights bill.  Bang took the point.  He also hinted </p><p>that Father Nguyen Van Ly\'s sentence could be reduced or </p><p>lifted, and voiced interest in continuing discussions of the </p><p>other points.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p>Ambassador:  If it\'s just talk, you won\'t like the </p><p>alternative. </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  Ambassador informed DFM Bang that there must be </p><p>significant progress on the issues discussed during the </p><p>Human Rights Dialogue in order to justify its continuation </p><p>and to avoid CPC designation for Vietnam.  Since Vietnam </p><p>appears to be moving so slowly on human rights issues, both </p><p>are real dangers. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  Ambassador praised some positive steps that the </p><p>GVN has taken.  Thich Huyen Quang\'s meeting with the Prime </p><p>Minister was important and his current relative freedom of </p><p>movement is welcome.  His recent activities during his trip </p><p>to Ho Chi Minh City, meetings with city authorities and with </p><p>his colleague Thich Quang Do are also good signs and should </p><p>be allowed to continue.  Other events Ambassador mentioned </p><p>include the opening of the Protestant theological school in </p><p>Ho Chi Minh City, the appointment of new Catholic Bishops, </p><p>and the emigration of actor Don Duong. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  Ambassador pointed out that there seems to have </p><p>been no action on other issues raised at the Human Rights </p><p>Dialogue.  He highlighted several individuals imprisoned for </p><p>what appears to be nothing more than the expression of their </p><p>own opinions, including Father Nguyen Van Ly, Le Chi Quang </p><p>and a number of journalists.  He noted that Thich Quang Do </p><p>is still under detention and asked for clarification of </p><p>Thich Huyen Quang\'s status. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  Ambassador reminded DFM Bang that the problems of </p><p>Vietnamese religious groups are closely monitored in the </p><p>U.S.  He urged that Central Highlands churches closed from </p><p>2001-2002 be allowed to reopen and that Central Highlands </p><p>churches be allowed to join the Evangelical Church of </p><p>Vietnam - South, if they wished.  Likewise, he called upon </p><p>the GVN to allow Protestant churches in the Northwest </p><p>Highlands to join the Evangelical Church of Vietnam - North. </p><p>While acknowledging a significant upsurge in legal religious </p><p>practice, Ambassador stated that the Highlands seem to be an </p><p>exception.  There appears to be a common, but false, </p><p>suspicion that Protestantism is a cover for separatism. </p><p>Ambassador recounted that a Highlands province leader had </p><p>told him that minorities who converted to Protestantism were </p><p>"betraying their traditions."  Such unjustified attitudes </p><p>seem to contribute to great problems for Protestants. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  Ambassador emphasized the benefits to Vietnam for </p><p>approaching human rights through a dialogue between </p><p>governments.  As in China, the dialogue is a way to </p><p>demonstrate to Congress and outside observers how the USG, </p><p>as well as the GVN, are working on human rights.  If </p><p>progress can be achieved through dialogue, there is little </p><p>reason to resort to stronger measures.  However, Ambassador </p><p>reminded DFM Bang, observers, including those with the </p><p>Department, question the point of a dialogue without results </p><p>and support for tougher and more public methods is building. </p><p>Ambassador also noted that Vietnam suffers in comparison to </p><p>China because the Chinese have become adept at taking </p><p>advantage of the dialogues to produce sufficient results to </p><p>dissipate pressure for more serious actions. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>DFM Bang:  It was your idea, but it\'s not a bad one. </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU)  DFM Bang remarked that the U.S.-Vietnam Human </p><p>Rights Dialogue was a U.S. initiative, that it had always </p><p>been difficult for the MFA to get permission to participate, </p><p>and that the MFA had worked hard to get other ministries to </p><p>participate in the last dialogue.  He said that Vietnam had </p><p>several other human rights dialogues and that such dialogues </p><p>should benefit relationships.  He remarked that he </p><p>understood that the U.S. dialogue was to satisfy the </p><p>concerns of "certain constituencies" in the U.S.  If the </p><p>U.S. decided not to continue the dialogue, there would be </p><p>those in the GVN who would be "more than happy."  While the </p><p>dialogue was mutually beneficial, it was "more necessary" </p><p>for the U.S., DFM Bang claimed. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU)  Responding to the persons of concern Ambassador </p><p>raised, DFM Bang said that such issues had to be decided on </p><p>an individual basis -- some would be successful -- others </p><p>would have to wait.  DFM Bang voiced surprise with Thich </p><p>Huyen Quang\'s recent treatment and commented that the </p><p>Buddhist leader is "almost a hero."  He claimed that there </p><p>had not been any restrictions on Thich Huyen Quang.  DFM </p><p>Bang suggested that a factor in the Buddhist leader\'s </p><p>changed situation was that his first-ever trip to Hanoi had </p><p>been an eye-opener and given him a better appreciation of </p><p>the situation for Buddhist followers and monks in the North. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU)  DFM Bang pointed out that in December 2002, </p><p>Senator McCain had spoken both to Deputy Prime Minister </p><p>Nguyen Tan Dung and to Bang on behalf of Don Duong. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU)  Father Nguyen Van Ly\'s "thinking is </p><p>progressing," according to what DFM Bang said he had heard. </p><p>(Note:  "Reform" on the part of the prisoner is required for </p><p>sentence reduction or amnesty.  End note.)  He added that he </p><p>"hoped for a breakthrough," in response to USG and </p><p>Congressional calls for Father Ly\'s freedom or a shortened </p><p>sentence. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (SBU)  There is "no problem with religion," according </p><p>to DFM Bang, because one may worship and practice religion </p><p>as one chooses in Vietnam.  Only when religion is used for </p><p>other purposes, such as by the "Dega Protestants" do </p><p>problems arise.  He claimed that there would be no problem </p><p>for those who wanted to join either the southern or northern </p><p>Evangelical Churches, although it was necessary to </p><p>distinguish "observing" religion from "abusing" it.  Life in </p><p>the Central Highlands was improving and there was room for </p><p>religion, but not if it was connected to Kok Ksor.  He added </p><p>that it was remarkable that there was harmony between </p><p>Vietnam\'s six major religions because this is not always the </p><p>case between overseas Vietnamese Buddhists and Catholics, </p><p>for instance.  Finally, he expressed hope that Vietnam would </p><p>establish relations with the Vatican soon. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (SBU)  DFM Bang repeated that if the U.S. did not want </p><p>to pursue the dialogue, that was acceptable to Vietnam. </p><p>The Ambassador pointedly noted that to stop the dialogue </p><p>would only lead to greater pressure within the U.S. to take </p><p>stronger measures against the SRV and that it was thus to </p><p>Vietnam\'s interest to find ways to maintain the dialogue. </p><p>Bang took the point and agreed that the dialogue was useful. </p><p>He noted that the GVN learns from and improves its </p><p>understanding of the U.S. through the dialogue; also, the </p><p>GVN does make improvements based on the dialogue.  He added </p><p>that the dialogue allows detailed discussion -- that cannot </p><p>be accomplished through demarches -- of a whole range of </p><p>human rights issues. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>DFM Bang:  The alternative is not good. </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  (SBU)  The GVN had noticed the Department\'s opposition </p><p>to the Vietnam Human Rights bill, DFM Bang said.  If the </p><p>bill passed, he predicted, it would anger "veterans and </p><p>hardliners" damaging relations and impacting on MIA, trade, </p><p>and humanitarian issues.  The bill would serve only the </p><p>interests of a small group of Vietnamese Americans, he </p><p>remarked. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>14.  (SBU)  DFM Bang appeared to take to heart that a </p><p>productive human rights dialogue is better than an unending </p><p>series of public confrontations.  He is probably the best </p><p>person in the GVN to articulate this message to his </p><p>colleagues both because he understands it and because he </p><p>appears to be committed to improving the overall </p><p>relationship.  He recalled that he was involved in the first </p><p>U.S.-Vietnam Human Rights Dialogue in 1993.  Major </p><p>challenges lie in whether he can focus enough attention </p><p>outside the MFA to achieve some progress, whether the GVN\'s </p><p>tortuous consensus-based decision-making process can achieve </p><p>prompt results, and whether there is sufficient political </p><p>will to overcome the opposition of those who are wedded to </p><p>Vietnam\'s closed systems and are suspicious of US motives. </p><p>Embassy and ConGen will continue to push for improvements, </p><p>particularly in areas laid out in reftel, but we are not </p><p>confident that we will see progress on more than a few of </p><p>the points in the next six months. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p></p></div>
