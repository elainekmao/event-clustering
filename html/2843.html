<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 001344 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/18/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PINS, PREL, KPAO, PHUM, PGOV, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: CORRUPTION CHARGE "SHOCKS" GON - MUST GANA GO? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER.  REASON 1.5(B). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) "Time" magazine recently reported that journalists </p><p>invited to Abuja to hear Information Minister Jerry Gana </p><p>lament alleged misrepresentations about Nigeria in foreign </p><p>media were given envelopes containing 50,000 Naira.  "Time" </p><p>implied that the money (about USD 400) was intended as a </p><p>bribe to solicit more favorable coverage. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) According to "ThisDay," President Obasanjo was ready </p><p>to fire Gana, but VP Atiku Abubakar intervened, suggesting an </p><p>investigation instead.  Inquiries by the State Security </p><p>Service (SSS) and others determined that Gana need not go. </p><p>The envelopes had contained modest sums clearly intended to </p><p>defray airfare and lodging for the Lagos-based journalists, </p><p>according to Justice Minister Godwin Kanu Agabi\'s report. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) The "Time" story was just another example of how </p><p>foreign media victimize Nigeria, fumed the GON.  Twenty-one </p><p>of the 24 invited foreign journalists, including CNN\'s Jeff </p><p>Koinange, who had been at the center of the original spat, </p><p>had accepted the money, the GON claimed.  Not only that, but </p><p>paying "honoraria" to journalists invited to cover an event </p><p>was a common practice -- engaged in by "USIS", among others, </p><p>the GON claimed.  In the future, those who "defame" the GON </p><p>would be subject to prosecution, Agabi huffed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) PAO Comment:  The claim about "USIS" is entirely </p><p>inaccurate.  PAS never provides honoraria for journalists </p><p>attending news events.  There may have been some confusion </p><p>with PAS sponsorship of journalists who participate in </p><p>International Visitor programs.  End PAO Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) The GON-owed "Daily Times" April 25 duly noted the </p><p>GON assertions in its news story but ran an editorial quite </p><p>critical of its owner.  The editorial quoted Gana\'s terse </p><p>dismissal of the sum as paltry ("What is $400?") and agreed </p><p>that the practice of "covering expenses" was common.  "But </p><p>with the government\'s...avowed war on corruption in the </p><p>country, it is sickening to note that such practice rather </p><p>than being discouraged is actively indulged in by its very </p><p>own officials.  Surely, foreign media organizations operating </p><p>in the country are buoyant enough to cater for all expenses </p><p>of their staff.  For the Information Ministry to offer </p><p>N50,000 to each journalist for whatever reason raises more </p><p>questions than answers. ...What could possibly be the </p><p>ultimate reason other than to compromise him to write </p><p>favorable reports?"  The newspaper then calls on its owner to </p><p>set an example and halt hand-outs to journalists. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Was "Jerry Propagana" guilty of attempted bribery? </p><p>Probably not.  Informed sources tell us that the going rate </p><p>for local "placement" is 100,000 Naira (about USD 800).  The </p><p>perennial Information Minister is far too experienced to </p><p>attempt mass-bribery of foreign media representatives at half </p><p>the rate for renting a local journalist\'s sympathies.  He </p><p>would take a subtler approach, shelling out more money to a </p><p>few key people he knows are for sale.  Also, paying a </p><p>journalist\'s travel and lodging is common practice.  While </p><p>PAS/Nigeria does not defray journalists\' travel expenses to </p><p>attend a press conference, many others with a story to tell </p><p>do just that -- not only the GON, but also politicians and </p><p>companies holding their annual meetings.  As "Daily Times" </p><p>suggests, however, the line between defraying travel costs </p><p>and purchasing influence is difficult to discern.  The GON </p><p>doubtless knows that, hence its self-righteous sputtering. </p><p>Also, political fixers, such as Works Minister Tony Anenih </p><p>are widely reputed to cajole with cash, usually capacious </p><p>"Ghana-Must-Go" bags stuffed with Naira notes. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) The GON is behaving like a habitually naughty child </p><p>who, this one time, is innocent.  With much braying and a bit </p><p>of foot-stamping, the GON tries to intimidate would-be </p><p>journalistic whistle-blowers.  But the targets seem to be </p><p>fighting back.  BBC ran a story about Agabi\'s threats on its </p><p>website, noting that Obasanjo\'s sensitivity to negative media </p><p>coverage was costing him opportunities to highlight his </p><p>Administration\'s achievements.  For most Nigerian </p><p>journalists, the entire discussion is unwelcome, as it puts a </p><p>major source of income at risk.  But they need not worry; the </p><p>GON and Nigerian elites are unlikely to discard proven </p><p>methods during an election year because of a minor scandal in </p><p>the international press.  Buying favorable coverage is part </p><p>of the political game, and sophisticated Nigerians will </p><p>continue to play it. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
