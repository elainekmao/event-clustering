<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 003153 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EUR/SE, NEA/NGA, PMAT; OSD FOR ISA AND ISP; JCS </p><p>FOR J5; EUCOM FOR J5, POLAD; CENTCOM FOR J5 AND POLAD; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/13/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MARR, MOPS, TU, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKISH MFA DELEGATION VISIT TO IRAQ:  ITS IN OUR </p><p>INTEREST TO SUPPORT IT </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 3078 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Acting DCM Scot Marciel.  Reasons:  1.5 (B </p><p>and D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) This is an action request.  See para 3. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Reftel reported the MFA\'s intention to send a </p><p>three-person delegation to Iraq beginning May 15.  The visit </p><p>is in large part in response to past invitations from the KDP </p><p>and PUK for a senior GOT delegation to visit northern Iraq. </p><p>The Turks\' overriding objective is to try to resolve some of </p><p>the outstanding issues and to improve relations.  We </p><p>understand the KDP and PUK support this visit, and that KDP </p><p>leader Barzani and PUK leader Talabani (both of whom are in </p><p>Baghdad) have agreed to meet with the delegation in Baghdad. </p><p>During a May 13 meeting with the Ambassador (septel), MFA U/S </p><p>Ziyal requested the Ambassador\'s assistance in facilitating </p><p>the visit, including arranging meetings with SPE Bremer and </p><p>ORHA\'s Garner and Moore. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Action request:  The USG has for years been a </p><p>steadfast and vocal supporter of improved Turkish-Kurdish </p><p>relations.  We recognize that conditions on the ground have </p><p>changed.  What has not changed is the tension between Turks </p><p>and Kurds and the impact these tensions could have on larger </p><p>US objectives in Iraq.  USG support for this visit also </p><p>furthers our commitment to transparency and </p><p>information-sharing with Ankara on issues of concern to </p><p>Turkey.  The more the Turks see for themselves the positive </p><p>developments that have taken place in Iraq since the end of </p><p>combat operations -- and the extent to which USG officials on </p><p>the ground can help shape their exposure through meetings -- </p><p>the better able we will be to manage Turkey\'s future behavior </p><p>vis-a-vis Iraq.  US failure to facilitate the visit -- </p><p>including opposition to the delegation\'s travel -- will be </p><p>widely interpreted here as evidence that we are not </p><p>interested in transparency with Ankara and will fuel Turkish </p><p>perceptions that we have something to hide in northern Iraq. </p><p>We therefore recommend that Washington agencies endorse the </p><p>GOT\'s request to visit Iraq and facilitate the visit, </p><p>including arranging USG meetings with the delegation in Iraq. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
