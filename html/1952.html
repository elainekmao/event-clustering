<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 002261 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAID, PREL, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: FLOOD DAMAGE IN NORTHERN NIGERIA GRAVE AND </p><p>WORSENING </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A)ABUJA 2259 (B) ABUJA 2260 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> 1.  (U) Summary:  The worst flooding in many years has wiped </p><p>out dozens of villages in northern Nigeria, killing over 300 </p><p>and displacing 1,600,000.  Floodwaters are rising in some </p><p>areas and receding in others.  There is an urgent need for </p><p>food, potable water, plastic clothing and shelter.  Even </p><p>elderly people say they have not seen flooding like this in </p><p>their lifetimes.  The magnitude of the disaster has </p><p>overwhelmed state and local capacity, and Nigeria\'s federal </p><p>government does not appear to be responding.  Further </p><p>flooding could take place downstream (toward Lake Chad). </p><p>Economic and social effects will be substantial and </p><p>long-lasting.  If not mitigated, they could be politically </p><p>destabilizing.  The GON will have to play a major role in </p><p>long-term relief for the people (largely subsistence farmers) </p><p>most gravely affected.  The USG can deliver a critical and </p><p>hugely positive impact by engaging energetically now. </p><p>Disaster declaration sent by niact immediate precedence ref </p><p>A; request to use helicopters contracted for Operation Focus </p><p>Relief in support of damage assessment transmitted ref B. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U)  Poloff, USAID Deskoff and two Mission FSNs visited </p><p>flooded areas of Kano and Jigawa states on September 6 and 7 </p><p>to assess the extent of the damage.  Flooding in both states </p><p>that began August 26 has resulted in approximately 317 </p><p>deaths, and roughly 1.6 million displaced persons.  35 of 44 </p><p>local government areas (LGA\'s) in Kano State were affected by </p><p>the flooding, as well as 20 of 24 in Jigawa.  Communities in </p><p>the southern parts of both states have seen floodwaters </p><p>recede, but streams and rivers are continuing to rise.  Many </p><p>communities lying in or along the floodplains in western Kano </p><p>and eastern Jigawa are isolated by as much as one or more </p><p>kilometers of water.  Some have yet to be visited by </p><p>government officials, due to lack of suitable water-craft. </p><p>People remaining in these cut-off villages are especially </p><p>vulnerable to illness resulting from the lack of potable </p><p>water, adequate food and clothing. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U)  Government officials in both states claim to be </p><p>meeting the immediate needs of the displaced persons. </p><p>However, the dimensions of this disaster clearly outstrip the </p><p>capacity of both local and state governments to respond.  At </p><p>this point, neither the Federal Government, nor NGO\'s, appear </p><p>to be delivering disaster relief.  From the descriptions of </p><p>local officials, this flood should probably be characterized </p><p>as a 100-year event.  As water continues to accumulate and </p><p>overflow dams in Kano, flooding will likely spread eastward </p><p>through Yobe, Bauchi and Borno states as the water moves </p><p>towards Lake Chad.  While the full dimensions of the disaster </p><p>are not yet clear, its economic and social effects will </p><p>likely be both severe and long-lasting for the affected </p><p>states and their people.  Many people have lost everything, </p><p>since the mud-brick walls of their houses simply dissolved, </p><p>washing away belongings and livestock, though occasionally </p><p>leaving a stranded roof where once a house stood. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U)  Before the flooding began, excessive seasonal rains </p><p>had already filled reservoirs to capacity and saturated much </p><p>of the ground in the affected areas.  During the week of </p><p>August 26, over ten inches inches fell during a two-day </p><p>period across much of Kano and Jigawa.  These rains caused </p><p>flash-flooding that damaged or destroyed villages situated </p><p>both within and outside floodplains.  While the water has </p><p>receded from some areas, water levels in reservoirs, rivers </p><p>and streams continue to rise elsewhere.  As of September 7, </p><p>Governor Kwankwaso of Kano State reported that water was </p><p>flowing over the tops of Tiga and Challawa dams at a height </p><p>of nearly two meters.  Consequently, the Hadejia and other </p><p>rivers in Kano continue to rise, making it difficult--and </p><p>treacherous-- to access already-isolated villages.  Many </p><p>residents trying to reach villages with supplies via </p><p>makeshift boats have drowned when these fragile crafts </p><p>capsize. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (U)  In southern Kano some LGA\'s appeared to be coping </p><p>relatively well with the crisis.  In Warawa, many displaced </p><p>persons had been received by local villages, and those who </p><p>had not were living in primary schools with clean wells. </p><p>Those living at the schools appeared to need clothing, food, </p><p>medicine, sleeping mats and mosquito nets.  Many of the men </p><p>were sleeping outdoors, and the people there reported </p><p>increased incidence of malaria.  In the Kura Local </p><p>Government, Emboffs visited a large village that had been 80 </p><p>percent destroyed by the flooding, and remained completely </p><p>surrounded by water.  Few in the North know how to swim, and </p><p>the team was forced to borrow a large canoe and push-pole in </p><p>order to access the village, as the boatman was gone and </p><p>no-one would assist for fear of drowning.  That particular </p><p>village had no potable water as all wells had been flooded. </p><p>The well being used had foul water a few feet down, when </p><p>normally the water was 24 feet below the surface.  Food and </p><p>clothing supplies in the village were inadequate.  The local </p><p>government chairman claimed that a team of doctors was </p><p>visiting each of the affected villages daily, but that seemed </p><p>unlikely, given the difficulty of accessing some of the </p><p>villages surrounded by water.  The crops in these areas did </p><p>not appear to be a total loss, as the flash-flooding receded </p><p>fairly quickly, and only crops left in standing water </p><p>appeared to be severely damaged. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (U)  In Wudil, situated at the western end of the Hadejia </p><p>flood plain, there were several camps for displaced persons </p><p>set up in primary schools, but people there complained of </p><p>inadequate food, clothing and medical attention.  Many </p><p>villages surrounding Wudil were totally destroyed by flash </p><p>flooding, and some were surrounded by water.  We stopped to </p><p>listen to Friday\'s Juma\'at prayers in Wudil, and the local </p><p>Imam called on all Muslims to take in anyone they knew who </p><p>was affected by the floods and ensure that they had adequate </p><p>food and shelter. </p><p>7. (U)  The flooding in Ringim, Jahun and other LGA\'s near </p><p>the Hadejia floodplain is severe.  Poloff was able to visit a </p><p>town of 20,000 people on the edge of the floodplain near </p><p>Jahun that had two to three feet of water standing in the </p><p>streets.  Villages deeper within the floodplain are entirely </p><p>inaccessible, and the waters there continue to rise due to </p><p>rain runoff from the Tiga and Challawa dams in Kano.  In </p><p>Dutse, government officials reported that they had ordered </p><p>twenty rubber boats with motors from the Delta region in </p><p>order to access and provide aid to the stranded villages. </p><p>Roads and bridges traversing the floodplain are reported to </p><p>be submerged, stopping all north-south traffic in Jigawa. </p><p>Standing on the southern edge of the floodplain, Poloff </p><p>observed water stretching north to the horizon. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU)  Federal Government involvement, including the </p><p>Nigerian Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), was practically </p><p>nil.  Deputy Speaker Chubidom Nwuche, an ethnic Igbo, visited </p><p>flooded areas at the same time as the Mission\'s team, but the </p><p>National Assembly has a limited ability to respond with any </p><p>short-term aid.  The Nigerian military was not engaged in any </p><p>flood relief efforts.  Governor Victor Ibechi of Akwa Ibom </p><p>visited Dutse and brought a truckload of corn to support </p><p>Jigawa\'s relief effort.  Governor Kwankwaso of Kano State </p><p>appeared to be more engaged in flood relief than his </p><p>counterpart in Jigawa, where the damage is much more severe </p><p>and widespread.  By September 7, Kwankwaso had already </p><p>identified land and begun the process of construction of some </p><p>resettlement villages for Kano\'s displaced persons. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (U)  Comment: The economic and social effects of this </p><p>disaster will be substantial and long-lasting.  If short-term </p><p>flood-response were viewed as a test of Nigeria\'s democratic </p><p>institutions, the Federal Government has made the poorest </p><p>showing.  There appears to be little or no co-ordination of </p><p>relief efforts between Abuja and the state and local </p><p>governments.  Abuja will have to become involved with </p><p>long-term aid efforts, as the states are not likely to be </p><p>able to support 1.6 to 2 million displaced persons who will </p><p>have little or no income until next year\'s harvest.  Governor </p><p>Kwankwaso expressed concern that, if they are not adequately </p><p>cared for, these people would migrate to Kano, where they </p><p>would be unemployed, impoverished, and restless.  It is clear </p><p>that in both the short and long terms, the people of Kano, </p><p>Jigawa, and possibly Yobe, Bauchi and Borno states will need </p><p>assistance beyond what the Federal, State and local </p><p>governments can provide.  By septel, the Mission is </p><p>requesting authority to release $25,000 to the Nigerian Red </p><p>Cross/Red Crescent societies, and the support of an OFDA </p><p>assessment team.  This is a rare opportunity for the USG to </p><p>build goodwill in the North, where many Muslims view us as </p><p>fundamentally anti-Muslim.  An effective long-term disaster </p><p>assistance program would also contribute substantially </p><p>towards maintaining stability and peace in a potentially </p><p>volatile region of Nigeria.
