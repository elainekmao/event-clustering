<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 005964 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR GARY EDSON </p><p>NEA FOR A/S BURNS </p><p>EB FOR A/S WAYNE </p><p>FOR U/S LARSON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/14/2007 </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, ECON, PREL, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDAN: U/S LARSON MEETINGS ON ECONOMIC PLANNING </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM Gregory L. Berry.  Reasons 1.5 (b) and </p><p>(d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  Under Secretary Larson had meetings in Amman </p><p>October 13-14 with Prime Minister Abul Ragheb and key </p><p>members of the Jordanian ministerial "economic team," </p><p>including Finance Minster Marto, Planning Minister </p><p>Awadallah, Trade Minister Bashir and Central Bank </p><p>Governor Umayya Toukan.  He also met Foreign Minister </p><p>Muasher and had a two-hour session with business leaders. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S)  The meetings were an opportunity to develop a </p><p>deeper understanding of the points raised in the </p><p>Jordanian paper on the economic impact on Jordan of </p><p>potential coalition military operations in Iraq.  In </p><p>preparation for Deputies-level discussions this week, </p><p>following are the main themes that emerged from Larson\'s </p><p>discussions.  These should be read in conjunction with </p><p>the State Department-prepared paper on economic </p><p>assistance to Jordan that has been submitted for the </p><p>Deputies\' deliberations. </p><p> </p><p>--   Sense of urgency.  All the ministers, but especially </p><p>the Prime Minister, stressed a strong desire to have </p><p>emergency U.S. assistance in hand well in advance of any </p><p>conflict, that is, ideally before year\'s end (given the </p><p>widespread assumption that operations would not begin </p><p>before that time).  The PM described at length how he </p><p>needed this both to prepare for economic consequences and </p><p>to reinforce domestic political support for the policies </p><p>Jordan would follow in the event of a conflict.  Larson </p><p>described the mismatch between this Jordanian timeline </p><p>and the U.S. budgetary process.  Understanding, however, </p><p>that it would be easier to sustain domestic political </p><p>support if there were a publicly useful show of U.S. </p><p>support for Jordan, a clear indication that a plan was in </p><p>place would be helpful, economically and politically, to </p><p>bridge the gap. </p><p> </p><p>--   Oil.  The ministers, particularly Marto, recognized </p><p>that Jordan\'s current oil arrangement with Iraq was not </p><p>sustainable in any case.  However, an abrupt transition </p><p>to market prices would be a major fiscal and economic </p><p>shock.  The foreign minister reported a slight opening </p><p>regarding supply alternatives:  The visiting Kuwaiti </p><p>minister of state for foreign affairs told the Jordanians </p><p>that he would propose a formula to his Saudi and UAE </p><p>counterparts for dividing up a package of 80,000 barrels </p><p>of crude per day for Jordan.  This could create an </p><p>opportunity to work with the Gulf producers to develop a </p><p>temporary plan for price mitigation.  Under Secretary </p><p>Larson will also raise Jordan\'s needs in meetings this </p><p>week in Saudi Arabia and the UAE.  Nevertheless, the </p><p>Jordanians are extremely dubious that the Gulf states </p><p>will provide oil on a discounted basis and thus mitigate </p><p>the sharp economic shock inherent in having their import </p><p>bill increase by 5% of GDP. </p><p> </p><p>--   Export Disruption.  Members of the business </p><p>community as well as the ministers highlighted the </p><p>importance of avoiding or minimizing a disruption of </p><p>Jordanian exports, particularly the booming textile </p><p>exports to the U.S. under the QIZ initiative.  Concerns </p><p>included reluctance of U.S. importers to place orders </p><p>during what is perceived to be a crisis period and the </p><p>risk of air and seaport closure, as well as war risk </p><p>insurance premiums that discourage port calls in Jordan </p><p>and Israel.  Larson described the U.S. experience last </p><p>year in dealing with similar issues involving exports </p><p>from Pakistan.  It could be useful to include such work </p><p>with insurance companies and leading importers in a plan </p><p>to address Jordan\'s needs. </p><p> </p><p>--   Bank Exposure.  Another specific concern was the </p><p>exposure of Jordan\'s banking system in the form of </p><p>letters of credit extended to finance Oil-for-Food </p><p>program exports to Iraq.  The Central Bank Governor </p><p>estimated that Jordanian banks had $500-700 million in </p><p>such credits outstanding at any one time.  Currently, the </p><p>banks are paid from the O-F-F account only after the UN </p><p>certifies delivery of goods in Baghdad.  As the governor </p><p>suggested, the UN could explore alternative procedures to </p><p>allow UN officials to certify delivery at the Iraqi </p><p>border or in special warehouses in Amman if it became </p><p>impossible to do so in Baghdad.  This could mitigate the </p><p>risk borne by the banks and facilitate the continued flow </p><p>of humanitarian goods to Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>--   Bilateral Jordanian Exports to Iraq.  Jordan </p><p>currently exports $200-$300 million in goods and services </p><p>to Iraq in partial payment for oil received under the </p><p>bilateral oil for goods barter arrangement.  This is a </p><p>declining but nevertheless substantial share of Jordan\'s </p><p>exports, as well as of employment and the company base. </p><p>Since alternative markets probably do not exist for these </p><p>generally low-quality goods, it is not immediately clear </p><p>how to address what is essentially a political risk. </p><p>--   Domestic Trucking.  Managing the reaction of the </p><p>politically important trucking industry that currently </p><p>moves the oil and goods trade with Iraq was clearly one </p><p>of the Prime Minister\'s main political preoccupations. </p><p>Further work could be done to sharpen our appreciation of </p><p>the demand for trucking services in the event of a </p><p>conflict, such as to move humanitarian or other goods </p><p>from Jordan to Iraq.  Such planning could allay some of </p><p>this concern. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  Larson stressed in all his meetings that </p><p>Jordan\'s concerns were receiving serious, top-level </p><p>attention in Washington.  He hoped that his trip could be </p><p>the beginning of a deeper exchange.  Once the U.S. was </p><p>ready, Jordanian ministers expressed their readiness to </p><p>travel to Washington or Europe to discuss economic </p><p>planning in greater depth. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Under Secretary Larson reviewed this message and </p><p>requested that it be distributed to participants in the </p><p>Deputies meetings. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
