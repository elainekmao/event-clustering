TOM MCDONALD.  REASONS: 1.5 (B) AND </p><p>(D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  DROC FOREIGN MINISTER YERODIA PAID A </p><p>BRIEF VISIT TO ZIMBABWE ON AUGUST 29 TO ASSUAGE </p><p>HARARE\'S CONCERNS AFTER PRESIDENT KABILA SAID HE WOULD </p><p>SEEK TO REVISE THE LUSAKA AGREEMENT.  AMBASSADOR </p><p>MCDONALD OBTAINED A READOUT ON YERODIA\'S VISIT FOM </p><p>NEW MFA PERMANENT SECRETARY AND THE UNDERSECRTARY FOR </p><p>AFRICA.  BOTH ITERATED THAT THE LUSAKA AGREEMENT IS </p><p>STILL ON TRACK.  THE UNDERSECRETARY SID ZIMBABWE IS </p><p>OPEN TO HEARING ANY PROPOSALS TO EVISE THE AGREEMENT, </p><p>BUT IT HAS NOT FORMED A POSTION ON KABILA\'S DESIRE </p><p>THAT UGANDA, RWANDA, ANDBURUNDI SHOULD BE NAMED AS </p><p>AGGRESSORS.  HOWEVER, ANY REVISION PROCESS SHOULD NOT </p><p>BE A HINDRANCE TOTHE MONUC PHASE II DEPLOYMENT, </p><p>ACCORDING TO THE IMBABWEAN MFA.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) AFTER AN AGUST 29 MEETING IN HARARE WITH </p><p>PRESIDENT MUGABE,DROC FOREIGN MINISTER YERODIA TOLD </p><p>REPORTERS THAT THE LUSAKA PROCESS WAS STILL ON TRACK </p><p>BUT SHOULDBE REVISED TO NAME RWANDA, UGANDA, AND </p><p>BURUNDI A AGGRESSORS.  CURRENT FACILITATOR MASIRE WAS </p><p>A "OMPLICATOR" AND COULD NOT BE TRUSTED.  IN HIS </p><p>PULIC COMMENTS, YERODIA SAID THAT, ALTHOUGH THE DROC </p><p>DID NOT THINK A FACILITATOR WAS NECESSARY, IT HAD </p><p>PROPOSED POSSIBLE ALTERNATIVES IN AN EFFORT TO B </p><p>FORTHCOMING, INCLUDING KENNETH KAUNDA, FREDERIKDE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  04849  01 OF 02  311700Z </p><p>KLERK, AND CYRIL RAMAPHOSA.  ZIMBABWEAN FOREIN </p><p>MINISTER MUDENGE TOLD JOURNALISTS THAT THE LUSAKA </p><p>ACCORDS HAD NOT BEEN "WRITTEN IN STONE," AND SID THE </p><p>DROC\'S DESIRE TO REVISE THE LUSAKA ACCORD WOULD BE </p><p>CONSIDERED. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) IN AN AUGUST 30MEETING ON A DIFFERENT TOPIC </p><p>WITH MFA PERMSEC WILARD CHIWEWE, THE AMBASSADOR ASKED </p><p>FOR A READOUT OF YERODIA\'S VISIT.  CHIWEWE NOTED THAT </p><p>HE HAD ATENDED PRESIDENT MUGABE\'S MEETING WITH </p><p>YERODIA, AD HAD NOT COME AWAY WITH THE SENSE THAT THE </p><p>CONGLESE GOVERNMENT WAS AN OBSTACLE TO FORWARD </p><p>MOVEMNT ON LUSAKA.  MASIRE HAD NOT BEEN DISCUSSED, </p><p>BUT HE EMPHASIZED THAT THE PHASE II MONUC DEPLOYMENT </p><p>MUST TAKE INTO ACCOUNT KABILA\'S CONCERNS ABOUT WHEE </p><p>THE TROOPS WILL BE DEPLOYED.  THE AMBASSADOR AKED </p><p>WHETHER YERODIA HAD INSISTED THAT LUSAKA BE EVISED. </p><p>THE USG, HE SAID, IS STRONGLY CONCERNED THAT OPENING </p><p>UP THE LUSAKA ACCORDS TO REVISION WOUD BE A SERIOUS </p><p>SETBACK TO THE PEACE PROCESS.  TH ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT, CHIWEWE REPLIED, BELIEVE WE HAVE COME </p><p>THIS FAR BECAUSE OF LUSAKA.  ANY REQUEST FOR REVISION, </p><p>HE SAID, WOULD REQUIRE A STRONG JUSTIFICATION, BUT THE </p><p>DROC GOVERNMENT HAD NOT YET ENGAGED IN THE FORMAL </p><p>AMENDMENT PROCESS PERMITTED UNDER ARTICLE 26.  ALL </p><p>INDICATIONS, CHIWEWE THOUGHT, ARE THAT LUSAKA IS ON </p><p>COURSE, PROVIDED THAT MONUC II DEPLOYS QUICKLY. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR AND POLOFFS MET SEPARATELY ON </p><p>AUGUST 31 WITH MFA UNDERSECRETARY FOR AFRICA DAVID </p><p>HAMADZIRIPI ABOUT YERODIA\'S DISCUSSIONS HERE. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  04849  01 OF 02  311700Z </p><p>HAMADZIRIPI SAID THE MEETING WAS INTENDED TO BE A </p><p>CONSULTATION AMONG THE ALLIES TO ENSURE THEY WERE ON </p><p>THE SAME TRACK AND TO DISCUSS ACCELERATING </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION OF THE LUSAKA AGREEMENTS.  DUE TO </p><p>SCHEDULING CONFLICTS, HOWEVER, ANGOLA WAS UNABLE TO </p><p>SEND ANYONE AND NAMIBIA WAS REPRESENTED BY ITS </p><p>AMBASSADOR HERE. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) YERODIA, HAMADZIRIPI SAID, HAD AGREED THAT </p><p>LUSAKA REMAINS VALID, BUT BELIEVED THERE WAS A NEED TO </p><p>REVIEW THE AGREEMENTS NOW THAT RWANDA, BURUNDI, AND </p><p>UGANDA HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED AS AGGRESSOR NATIONS IN </p><p>UNSCR 1304, AND BECAUSE SOME OF THE ORIGINAL REBEL </p><p>SIGNATORIES HAVE NOW WITHDRAWN FROM THE CONFLICT. </p><p>HAMADZIRIPI INDICATED THAT ZIMBABWE IS OPEN TO </p><p>REVIEWING ANY PROPOSALS FOR AMENDMENTS, AS PERMITTED </p><p>BY ARTICLE 26, BUT HAD NOT YET TAKEN A POSITION ON THE </p><p>SUBSTANCE OF POSSIBLE CHANGES.  HAMADZIRIPI DID NOT </p><p>SEE A FORMAL REVIEW OF LUSAKA AS AN OBSTACLE TO THE </p><p>MONUC PHASE II DEPLOYMENT.  PARTICIPANTS IN THE </p><p>DISCUSSIONS WELCOMED RWANDA\'S PROPOSAL TO WITHDRAW 200 </p><p>KM, AND DEFENSE MINISTERS OF DROC\'S ALLIES PLAN TO </p><p>MEET SOON TO DISCUSS THE MODALITIES OF DISENGAGEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ6198 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  04849  02 OF 02  311700Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    ACQ-00   CIAE-00  SMEC-00  INL-00   DODE-00 </p><p>      DOEE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00   FAAE-00 </p><p>      VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01   L-00 </p><p>      VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00 </p><p>      PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    SSO-00   TRSE-00 </p><p>      USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-01   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00 </p><p>      SAS-00   SWCI-00    /010W </p><p>                  ------------------804B1C  311700Z /38 </p><p>O 311659Z AUG 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 6981 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>RWANDA COLLECTIVE </p><p>AMEMBASSY LONDON </p><p>AMEMBASSY PARIS </p><p>NSC WASHDC </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 004849 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p>LONDON FOR CHARLES GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p>USUN FOR HOLBROOKE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/31/10 </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  04849  02 OF 02  311700Z </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, PREL, MOPS, ZI, CG </p><p>SUBJECT: DROC FOREIGN MINISTER VISITS HARARE </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) ACCORDING TO HAMADZIRIPI, MASIRE\'S ROLE AS </p><p>PEACE FACILITATOR DID NOT COME UP IN THE PRIVATE </p><p>DISCUSSIONS.  THIS IS A SENSITIVE ISSUE FOR ZIMBABWE, </p><p>HE POINTED OUT, BECAUSE THE GOZ WANTS TO IMPLEMENT </p><p>LUSAKA BUT DOES NOT WANT TO OFFEND BOTSWANA BY </p><p>UNCEREMONIOUSLY DUMPING THE WELL-RESPECTED MASIRE. </p><p>PRESIDENT KABILA IS ABSOLUTELY OPPOSED TO MASIRE, SO </p><p>ZIMBABWE MUST HELP COME UP WITH AN ALTERNATIVE PLAN </p><p>THAT DOES NOT DENIGRATE MASIRE.  THE GOZ, HAMADZIRIPI </p><p>RECALLED, HAD ACCEPTED THE NAMIBIAN PROPOSAL THAT TWO </p><p>EMINENT PERSONS BE ASKED TO WORK WITH MASIRE.  DESPITE </p><p>THE OPPOSITION TO THE PROPOSAL BY THE DROC AND OTHERS, </p><p>HAMADZIRIPI WAS CONFIDENT A WAY OUT COULD BE FOUND, AS </p><p>THE DROC IS COMMITTED TO THE FACILITATION PROCESS. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) EVINCING A BIT OF FRUSTRATION, HAMADZIRIPI </p><p>SAID THE COUNTRIES OF THE REGION HAD WORKED HARD TO </p><p>KEEP THE LUSAKA PROCESS ALIVE, AND HE CRITICIZED THE </p><p>UN FOR "LETTING US DOWN."  THE AMBASSADOR REMINDED </p><p>HAMADZIRIPI THAT PRESIDENT KABILA BORE MOST OF THE </p><p>BLAME FOR THE SLOW PACE OF PROGRESS, AND SAID MONUC II </p><p>COULD NOT PROCEED UNTIL KABILA PROVIDES THE NECESSARY </p><p>SECURITY GUARANTEES AND ALLOWS DEPLOYMENT IN AREAS HIS </p><p>GOVERNMENT CONTROLS.  HAMADZIRIPI ACKNOWLEDGED THE </p><p>POINT, AND SAID THE GOZ WOULD DO ALL IT COULD TO </p><p>ENSURE THE CONDITIONS WERE RIGHT FOR THE PHASE II </p><p>DEPLOYMENT.  ZIMBABWE\'S INVOLVEMENT IN THE DROC, </p><p>HAMADZIRIPI INSISTED, WAS MOTIVATED GENUINELY BY THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  04849  02 OF 02  311700Z </p><p>PRINCIPLE OF PROTECTING A NATION\'S SOVEREIGN BORDERS, </p><p>NOT BY ECONOMIC INTERESTS, AND THE GOZ WOULD CONTINUE </p><p>TO REMAIN ENGAGED IN THIS PROCESS. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) COMMENT:  HAMADZIRIPI IS THE MOST SENIOR MFA </p><p>OFFICIAL ENGAGED ON A DAILY BASIS ON DROC POLICY, AND </p><p>SO IS MUCH MORE THOROUGHLY BRIEFED ON DROC THAN </p><p>CHIWEWE, WHO ASSUMED HIS CURRENT POSITION ONLY ON </p><p>AUGUST 28.  HAMADZIRIPI, HOWEVER, IS SOMETIMES OVERLY </p><p>OPTIMISTIC AND FAILS TO ACKNOWLEDGE ZIMBABWE\'S CLEAR </p><p>ECONOMIC INTERESTS IN THE DROC.  LIKE THE REST OF THE </p><p>MFA, HE DID NOT APPEAR PHASED BY KABILA\'S LATEST </p><p>WRANGLINGS, AND REMAINED HOPEFUL AFTER YERODIA\'S VISIT </p><p>THAT THE DROC WOULD STICK TO LUSAKA AND THAT THE MONUC </p><p>DEPLOYMENT WOULD GO FORWARD.  DESPITE ZIMBABWE\'S </p><p>CONTINUING AND INTENSIFYING DIFFICULTIES WITH KABILA, </p><p>HE IS STILL KEY TO ENDING THE GOZ\'S MILITARY </p><p>ENTANGLEMENT THERE. </p><p> </p><p>MCDONALD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
