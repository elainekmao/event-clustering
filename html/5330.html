<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 000147 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA/INS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PGOV, CE, LTTE - Peace Process, Human Rights </p><p>SUBJECT:  Sri Lanka:  Human rights cases continue to </p><p>move through judicial system, if somewhat erratically </p><p> </p><p>Ref:  02 Colombo 1427 and previous </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary:  This update reviews the progress of </p><p>four high profile human rights related court cases, </p><p>including: </p><p> </p><p>-- Kandy election day killings - continuation of a case </p><p>against a high-profile political family and security </p><p>forces for killing 10 supporters of a Muslim party; </p><p> </p><p>-- Krishanthi Coomaraswamy - an appeal by six security </p><p>force personnel on their conviction of raping and </p><p>killing Coomaraswamy; </p><p> </p><p>-- Bindunuwewa massacre - ongoing trial of 41 civilians </p><p>and 10 security force personnel accused of killing 23 </p><p>Tamils in a rehabilitation camp; </p><p> </p><p>-- Mailanthanai - acquittal of security force personnel </p><p>accused of killing 32 people; </p><p> </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Kandy election day killings </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>2. (SBU) Anuruddha Ratwatte, the former Defense Minister </p><p>and a relative of President Kumaratunga, had his bail </p><p>revoked on January 21.  Ratwatte\'s two sons and thirteen </p><p>other defendants, including security force personnel, </p><p>have been accused of murdering ten Muslim campaign </p><p>workers on election day December 5, 2001, allegedly </p><p>under the direction of Ratwatte.  The trial-at-bar </p><p>hearing was taking place during the afternoon of </p><p>January 27.  (Note:  A trial-at-bar replaces a jury with </p><p>three high court judges with the intended effect of </p><p>speeding up the trial process and limiting the </p><p>possibility of harassing witnesses.) </p><p> </p><p>Krishanthi Coomaraswamy </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>3. (SBU) In 1999, six security force personnel were </p><p>convicted for and sentenced to death for the rape and </p><p>murder of Tamil student Krishanthi Coomaraswamy.  This </p><p>case garnered widespread publicity in Sri Lanka because </p><p>of the rarity, at the time, of the GSL prosecuting cases </p><p>against its security forces.  It is still one of a few </p><p>cases resulting in the conviction of security force </p><p>personnel.  In addition, the case gained notoriety when </p><p>two of the defendants claimed to have knowledge of mass </p><p>burial sites in the Chemmani area (the Chemmani case is </p><p>reviewed in Reftels).  On January 7, the Sri Lankan </p><p>Supreme Court agreed to hear the appeal on this case.  A </p><p>date for the hearing has not yet been set. </p><p> </p><p>Bindunuwewa massacre </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>4. (SBU) In October 2000, 27 Tamils held at the </p><p>Bindunuwewa rehabilitation camp for former child </p><p>soldiers were killed while police allegedly looked on. </p><p>In May 2001, a court case against 51 suspects began with </p><p>the reading of 83 charges.  During the most recent </p><p>hearing, January 21, the Colombo High Court acquitted 23 </p><p>of the accused, stating there was a lack of evidence to </p><p>hold them.  Three students from a local teacher training </p><p>college, one police officer and nineteen villagers were </p><p>acquitted. </p><p> </p><p>Mailanthanai </p><p>------------ </p><p>5. (SBU) In 1994, a case began against 21 security force </p><p>personnel accused of murdering 35 Tamil civilians in </p><p>Mailanthanai, in eastern Sri Lanka.  The trial came to </p><p>an end with an acquittal of the security force personnel </p><p>on November 25, 2002.  The attorneys for the aggrieved </p><p>parties recently met with the Attorney General asking </p><p>that the case be reopened.  Some of the attorneys allege </p><p>that the Sinhala jury ignored evidence in acquitting the </p><p>security forces.  The case remains closed. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>6. (SBU) The GSL continues to press forward on numerous </p><p>human rights cases, including those reviewed above. </p><p>Despite the efforts of the Attorney General\'s office to </p><p>see progress in the cases it is pursuing, it continues </p><p>to have to grapple with a slow and somewhat erratic </p><p>judicial system.  In the end, however, the cases are </p><p>moving through the court system and decisions will </p><p>eventually be reached.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p>AMSELEM </p><p></p></div>
