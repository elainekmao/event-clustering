<p>UNCLAS GUATEMALA 001191 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>HARARE FOR BRUCE WHARTON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PREL, PGOV, KJUS, GT </p><p>SUBJECT: ANOTHER LANDMARK TOPPLED: MACK CONVICTION </p><p>OVERTURNED </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. 02 GUATEMALA 2605 </p><p> </p><p>     B. GUATEMALA 1084 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) SUMMARY: On May 7, the Fourth Court of Appeals </p><p>overturned the Third Sentencing Court\'s October 3, 2002 </p><p>conviction of Colonel (ret.) Juan Valencia Osorio (Ref A). </p><p>The Fourth Court of Appeals also found Helen Mack\'s appeal of </p><p>the acquittal of General (ret.) Edgar Godoy Gaitan and </p><p>Colonel (ret.) Juan Oliva Carerra invalid (Ref B).  All three </p><p>defendants were released immediately.  The Ambassador </p><p>attended the appeal and spoke with the press afterward (para </p><p>4).  Helen Mack intends to appeal to the Supreme Court within </p><p>the allotted 15 days. Our public statements on this are </p><p>crafted to support the trial process without interfering. End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) The Fourth Court of Appeals released their decision on </p><p>the Mack case on May 7, to an overflowing courtroom filled </p><p>with family members, human rights advocates, and pro-military </p><p>observers.  Outside the courtroom, ex-PACS were protesting </p><p>and disgruntled would-be observers jostled for position. </p><p>When the Ambassador arrived - a sign of the intense US </p><p>interest in the case - he was verbally harassed by members of </p><p>a tense and partisan crowd as he entered the courtroom. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) The Fourth Court of Appeals decided that there was a </p><p>contradiction in the Third Sentencing Court\'s October 3, 2002 </p><p>decision.  They said that the Third Court was erroneous in </p><p>finding one defendant guilty for a crime that came out of a </p><p>chain of command, even though Valencia Osorio admitted that </p><p>he transmitted the order to assassinate Myrna Mack. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) After the release of the decision, the Ambassador told </p><p>the press: "We believe this case is of enormous importance </p><p>for the Guatemalan system of jurisprudence.  We of course </p><p>respect the decision of the Guatemalan judiciary.  At the </p><p>same time, we find it extremely disappointing that, 13 years </p><p>after such a barbarous crime, its intellectual authors remain </p><p>free." </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) HROff spoke to Helen Mack shortly after the verdict. </p><p>She said that she was horribly disappointed that the </p><p>Guatemalan justice system had again failed her, and that she </p><p>would appeal the Fourth Court\'s decision to the Supreme Court </p><p>immediately.  She and her team of lawyers have fifteen days </p><p>to formulate their new appeal. </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) COMMENT: We are disappointed that yet another landmark </p><p>conviction in a human rights case has been overturned by the </p><p>Fourth Court of Appeals (the first being Gerardi, also in </p><p>October 2002).  We will remain vigilant in our efforts to </p><p>protect Helen Mack and her team from threats, and to support </p><p>justice for the killing of Myrna Mack. </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) COMMENT CONTINUED: We do not have yet an assessment on </p><p>juridical grounds of the latest sentence. Nor do we know yet </p><p>what the prospects are of overturning the Appeals Court </p><p>verdict. We will pursue both questions with our contacts. The </p><p>Embassy will also release a statement along the lines of the </p><p>Ambassador\'s statements (para 4), and we encourage the </p><p>Department to do likewise. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) COMMENT CONTINUED: We continue to walk a fine line </p><p>on this case: we support Helen Mack\'s quest for justice, but </p><p>we do not want to be perceived as interfering in the judicial </p><p>process, which would be counterproductive for the Mack case </p><p>and our overall human rights objectives. </p><p>HAMILTON </p><p></p></div>
