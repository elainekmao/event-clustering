O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EINV, ETRD, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: Business and the Stayaway </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary: Zimbabwe\'s business sector remained mostly </p><p>neutral during the opposition-led stayaway March 19-20. </p><p>Most companies sympathize with many opposition aims, but </p><p>are unwilling to test the wrath of the GOZ.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. We have spoken to over a dozen multinational and local </p><p>company heads about the stayaway.  These firms paid </p><p>employees who were prevented from working during the </p><p>stayaway.  Company reps acknowledged their operations </p><p>suffered losses but none seemed overtly hostile to the </p><p>opposition tactic.  However, several businessmen were </p><p>uncomfortable with the prospect of further stayaways, </p><p>arguing that industry could not sustain additional </p><p>hardship. </p><p> </p><p>Cost of Stayaways </p><p>----------------- </p><p>3. Local economists agree that the cost of stayaways is </p><p>formidable.  Using very crude data of 70 percent </p><p>production stoppage for two of 250 annual workdays, an </p><p>industry economist suggested the stayaway may have shaved </p><p>as much as .4 percent from 2003 GDP.  Since many </p><p>companies are already operating at less than full </p><p>capacity, however, they may be able to recoup production </p><p>losses over the next weeks, mitigating any negative </p><p>impact on national output. </p><p> </p><p>The Discomfort of Taking Sides </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>4. A senior Barclays executive received a phone call from </p><p>a high MDC official urging that Barclays not open on the </p><p>strike\'s second day.  In part due to its British origins, </p><p>this made Barclays extremely uncomfortable, although the </p><p>bank was largely closed on the second day anyway. </p><p>Another businessman, Anthony Mandiwanza, head of the </p><p>Dairiboard as well as the Confederation of Zimbabwe </p><p>Industries, said the stayaway was not relevant for </p><p>businesses the day before the strike.  He took heavy </p><p>criticism in the independent press for this remark. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>5. Contending with a government that intuitively </p><p>distrusts the private sector, companies are loath to </p><p>publicly support stayaways or other political protest. </p><p>White commercial farmers paid dearly for backing the </p><p>Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) in last year\'s </p><p>elections.  GOZ officials have already argued that pro- </p><p>MDC firms "shut out" employees from work.  Where </p><p>possible, we expect the private sector will continue to </p><p>steer clear of open political engagement. </p><p> </p><p>Sullivan </p><p></p></div>
