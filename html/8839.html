DART Field Team West visited a rural health center and </p><p>two village water supply units on 8 June in An Najaf with </p><p>DART-partner International Rescue Committee, which has </p><p>already begun DART-funded work in rural water and health in </p><p>An Najaf and Karbala.  The DART also met with WFP staff, who </p><p>said the June food distribution was going according to </p><p>schedule.  Before departing An Najaf, the DART spoke with </p><p>members of the Coalition\'s Governorate Support Team to share </p><p>updates and receive briefs on various new sectoral projects. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>AN NAJAF FOOD UPDATE </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  U.N. World Food Program (WFP) staff in An Najaf reported </p><p>that on-going June distributions are progressing without </p><p>major difficulties.  The issue of increased transportation </p><p>costs continues to irritate food agents, and WFP has </p><p>received continuous complaints that the reimbursement </p><p>amounts announced by the Ministry of Trade (MOT) do not </p><p>compensate drivers sufficiently.  This issue remains </p><p>unresolved. </p><p> </p><p>3.  WFP is working with the MOT to prepare lists of needed </p><p>equipment, supplies, and repairs for PDS infrastructure, as </p><p>well as a list of employees at the warehouses and silo that </p><p>qualify for overtime.  These lists will be presented to the </p><p>Coalition\'s Civil Military Operations Center (CMOC) for </p><p>verification and possible funding.  The CMOC confirmed this </p><p>process and agreed to work closely with WFP and the MOT to </p><p>facilitate improvements to the public distribution system </p><p>(PDS). </p><p> </p><p>4.  WFP reported receiving 150 metric tons (MT) of beans and </p><p>300 MT of rice from neighboring governorates to round out </p><p>needed food stocks to complete June\'s distribution. </p><p>Although final stock numbers are difficult to confirm, WFP </p><p>is confident that all June rations will be distributed as </p><p>specified for the announced June ration in An Najaf.  WFP </p><p>will soon begin monitoring actual beneficiary distributions </p><p>for June to assure that the final step in the PDS is </p><p>properly satisfied. </p><p> </p><p>5.  It also confirmed that 130,000 MT of older wheat is </p><p>stored in the area.  According to WFP, 47,000 MT of this </p><p>wheat was purchased under the U.N. Oil for Food Program last </p><p>year in Russia, Australia, and Syria.  The remaining 83,000 </p><p>MT is supposedly an older, local purchase, but exact </p><p>purchase dates are not confirmed.  WFP agreed to collect </p><p>additional and more accurate information on these older </p><p>stocks from the MOT in An Najaf to determine age, location, </p><p>origin, and quality of the wheat. </p><p> </p><p>6.  WFP reported that Save the Children would be working </p><p>with WFP in the An Najaf Governorate on vulnerable group </p><p>feedings.  The DART was not able to contact Save the </p><p>Children to discuss this issue. </p><p> </p><p>7.  The MOT has received letters informing them of a USD </p><p>50,000 operation account that will soon be established for </p><p>PDS operational costs.  No other news or instructions have </p><p>been received by WFP in An Najaf on the management of this </p><p>account. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>RURAL HEALTH IN AN NAJAF </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>8.  Fifty percent of children under the age of five in the </p><p>El Hideria area of An Najaf are malnourished, according to </p><p>the director of the El Hideria Primary Health Center (PHC) </p><p>with whom the DART met on 8 June with partner International </p><p>Rescue Committee (IRC).  Many of the area\'s residents are </p><p>poor, he said, including 14,000 of the area\'s 35,000 people </p><p>who were internally displaced from the south in 1991.  He </p><p>said they were living in difficult conditions with no </p><p>electricity, potable water, transportation, adequate </p><p>healthcare, livelihoods, or education for their children. </p><p>IRC has proposed supporting the El Hideria PHC with DART </p><p>funds, in addition to supporting seven other PHCs in rural </p><p>An Najaf and Karbala. </p><p> </p><p>9.  Prior to the war, the PHC, which has five doctors (three </p><p>women), received 110 patients a day.  Since the advent of </p><p>free drugs one week ago, the director said that number has </p><p>increased to over 200.  At 10:45 a.m. on June 8, 180 </p><p>patients had already entered the health center seeking </p><p>treatment.  Since the end of the war, unexploded ordnance </p><p>(UXOs) have injured 30 to 35 area residents.  Last week, the </p><p>PHC treated three UXO injuries.  Half of all injured were </p><p>children. </p><p> </p><p>10.  The PHC Director said diarrhea was the greatest problem </p><p>for children, and that many of the area\'s poor did not have </p><p>sufficient funds to travel to the PHC.  The first 50 of 70 </p><p>child patients entering the PHC on 8 June suffered from </p><p>diarrhea.  Fueling the problem, he said, was that 70 percent </p><p>of local residents rely on unfiltered river water.  Many </p><p>receive water from tankers whose owners charge according to </p><p>the quantity and quality of water.  Fifty percent of the </p><p>area\'s children were lower than average on the weight-for- </p><p>height chart, according to the director.  Another large </p><p>health problem, he said, was Typhoid fever with about 30 </p><p>cases a day.  Among female adults, anemia was the greatest </p><p>problem.  The director said 25 percent of women suffered </p><p>from severe anemia. </p><p> </p><p>Other challenges facing the PHC include: </p><p> </p><p>--  Half of the PHC\'s power comes from its generator; the </p><p>other half from the sporadic governorate electric grid; </p><p> </p><p>--  The center normally gets two hours of piped water in the </p><p>morning and two hours in the afternoon; </p><p> </p><p>--  During the war, the immunization program stopped, but it </p><p>has since restarted; </p><p> </p><p>--  The staff has not received post-war salary payments yet, </p><p>although they have gotten their USD 20 emergency payments; </p><p> </p><p>--  The PHC has stocks of many drugs, but it is short on </p><p>certain essential items; </p><p> </p><p>--  Following the war, thieves tried to steal the PHC\'s </p><p>generator and some drugs; and </p><p> </p><p>--  The PHC\'s x-ray room has been closed for 10 years and is </p><p>covered with dust. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>RURAL WATER IN AN NAJAF </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  The DART visited two compact water treatment units </p><p>(CWTU) in rural An Najaf on 8 June that partner IRC has been </p><p>rehabilitating with DART funds.  IRC has already begun work </p><p>on five others, and proposes to rehabilitate a total of 33 </p><p>in An Najaf, and to replace nine with temporary treatment </p><p>units.  There are 60 CWTUs in An Najaf.  The </p><p>DART visited compact water units in El Barakia and El </p><p>Bonoman.  El Barakia provides 1,000 cubic meters of water a </p><p>day and serves 2,000 people; El Bonoman produces 300 cubic </p><p>meters of treated water per day and serves over 2,000.   The </p><p>El Barakia system has a pipe network of 4 kilometers (kms), </p><p>and the El Bonoman extends for 3 kms.  Each network is in </p><p>good condition.  With IRC\'s intervention at El Barakia, the </p><p>unit\'s water capacity increased and its water quality </p><p>improved with the restarting of the chlorinator.  Prior to </p><p>IRC\'s involvement at the El Bonoman unit, the system pumped </p><p>river water directly into the network.  Now, the water is </p><p>filtered, and soon, will be treated with chlorine. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>AN NAJAF GOVERNORATE SUPPORT TEAM UPDATE </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  The DART visited the CMOC in An Najaf on 8 June and </p><p>spoke with members of the Governorate Support Team (GST). </p><p>The following are some updates from the meeting: </p><p> </p><p>--  Security:  Nine classes have gone through a four-day </p><p>training course, totaling approximately 600 police officers </p><p>that have been trained thus far.  They have also been </p><p>provided with basic equipment (uniforms, weapons, whistles, </p><p>etc.); they hope to train another 600 officers who will be </p><p>in charge of rural areas. </p><p> </p><p>--  Salaries:  Government employees have been paid for </p><p>April, and they hope to catch up to June salaries by the end </p><p>of the month.  The Ministry of Welfare and Benefits </p><p>attempted to pay out retirement, welfare, and pension </p><p>payments on 8 June, however, crowd control was a problem and </p><p>payments were postponed until a better system could be </p><p>established. </p><p> </p><p>--  Fuel:  An Najaf received 1,300 bottles of liquid </p><p>petroleum gas (LPG) on 8 June and 17 trucks of fuel on 7 </p><p>June.  The GST has been told that regular distributions to </p><p>the city will begin in the next couple of days. </p><p> </p><p>--  The CMOC is concerned about "a squatter problem" in the </p><p>city.  According to the CMOC, many, if not all, of the </p><p>vacant buildings are being occupied by squatter families. </p><p>CMOC has also heard that one of the local orphanages and the </p><p>mental health institution have also been occupied by </p><p>squatters, which is preventing orphans and patients from </p><p>accessing services in these buildings.  According to the </p><p>head of the GST, Save the Children is attempting to find </p><p>office and living space in the city, but has not yet found </p><p>anything adequate. </p><p> </p><p>--  Health:  A Coalition Civil Affairs (CA) officer recently </p><p>assessed seven rural health clinics in An Najaf and said of </p><p>them, "The farther we go out, the worse they are."  He said </p><p>some of the 19 PHCs and 17 "sub-clinics" in An Najaf have no </p><p>equipment, air-conditioning, windows, and little supplies of </p><p>drugs.  He is developing proposals to revamp 17 PHCs at a </p><p>cost of USD 1,000 each.  He said IRC had delivered the DART- </p><p>funded emergency health kits and that they were being </p><p>distributed.  "They were happy to see them," he said of </p><p>Ministry of Health (MOH) personnel in An Najaf.  He has also </p><p>arranged for 120 security personnel to be added to the MOH </p><p>payroll.  The new guards will have a one-day training and </p><p>will patrol the city\'s five hospitals that are still facing </p><p>insecurity. </p><p> </p><p>--  Education:  CA officers gave 18 schools in An Najaf USD </p><p>500 each for immediate rehabilitation.  The school staff can </p><p>spend the funds on replacing windows and doors, painting </p><p>walls, repairing electricity and plumbing, or provide </p><p>supplies and furnishings.  The choice lies with the school </p><p>staff.  Receipts for all purchases must be returned within </p><p>two weeks.  The CA officers said they would do the same for </p><p>all 550 Najaf schools (at a cost of USD 250,000) if they had </p><p>the funds.  Other Coalition units have renovated 10 schools </p><p>and plan to complete more before the start of the new school </p><p>year. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS SOCIETY OF AN NAJAF </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>13.  The DART attempted to visit the Human Rights Society in </p><p>An Najaf on 8 June; however, it had closed for the </p><p>afternoon.  The DART was able to speak to the guard and were </p><p>told that the society had just recently begun work.  Most of </p><p>its focus at this time is on the missing and prisoners of </p><p>war.  Their building is quite rudimentary; there is no glass </p><p>on any of the windows, for example, and a family of </p><p>squatters is living in the room next door. </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
