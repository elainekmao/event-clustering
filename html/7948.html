<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ISTANBUL 000671 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, EUR AND EB </p><p>TREASURY FOR U/S TAYLOR AND OASIA - MILLS </p><p>NSC FOR QUANRUD AND BRYZA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, PREL, TU, Istanbul </p><p>SUBJECT: ISTANBUL IN THE SPRINGTIME: RESURGENT OPTIMISM </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but Unclassified - not for internet distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU)  Summary: As a belated spring bursts forth on the </p><p>Bosphorus following an unusually cold and protracted winter, </p><p>"spring is also in the air" in Istanbul business circles. </p><p>The resurgent optimism stems from speedy conclusion to the </p><p>war in Iraq and belief that its short-term cost for Turkey </p><p>was limited, and will easily be surpassed by the long-term </p><p>benefits access to the Iraqi market can provide.  With </p><p>declining interest rates, a strengthening lira, and improving </p><p>inflation performance, Istanbul business leaders believe that </p><p>four-five percent GDP growth is no longer out of the </p><p>question.  Some tourism industry leaders now indicate that in </p><p>place of the 50-60 percent dropoff they earlier predicted, </p><p>Turkey\'s tourism loss can be held to 15 percent, leaving the </p><p>country ahead of last year\'s levels.  With strong export </p><p>growth, the key issue remains domestic demand, which has </p><p>rebounded in some sectors, but not across the board. </p><p>Istanbul\'s business elite expects the turn around to deepen </p><p>in the second half of 2003, however, as the uncertainty </p><p>caused by the war recedes.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Gloom Recedes: In place of the extreme pessimism </p><p>that characterized the run-up to the Iraq war and </p><p>accompanying concern about U.S.-Turkish relations and the </p><p>depth of the government\'s commitment to the IMF program, </p><p>optimism is now in the air in Istanbul.  Whereas analysts two </p><p>months ago saw no engine for growth in the economy other than </p><p>exports, and saw serious impacts from the war on domestic </p><p>demand, tourism, and public investment, there is now </p><p>widespread expectation that only the latter will act as a </p><p>brake on growth.  The improvement in sentiment is evident in </p><p>the latest Central Bank Survey, which reports improving </p><p>expectations on growth (up to 3.7 percent), inflation (down </p><p>to 26.6 percent) and interest rates. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Tourism: While tourism leaders we canvassed in March </p><p>gloomily predicted a 50-60 percent drop to 5.5 billion as a </p><p>result of the war, they are now relatively more sanguine. </p><p>The sector did experience a 25 percent drop in March, </p><p>following a 15 percent gain in the first two months of the </p><p>year, but some industry leaders believe recovery to near 2002 </p><p>levels is not out of the question.  Turkish Tourist Agency </p><p>Union (TURSAB) head Basaran Ulusoy told us on May 7 that he </p><p>believes the loss can be held to 10-15 percent from the </p><p>year-end target of 15 million tourists, leaving Turkey ahead </p><p>of last year\'s level.  Tourism Investors\' Association </p><p>Secretary General Nedret Koruyan is more circumspect, </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>suggesting that while tourist numbers may recover to last </p><p>year\'s level, overall revenues will decline, as foreign </p><p>travel agencies are agressively pressing for discounts for </p><p>last minute bookings.  She noted, though, that the decline </p><p>will not approach the magnitudes the industry earlier feared. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Exports:  One of the driving forces behind last </p><p>year\'s growth seems only to have picked up pace in the first </p><p>four months of 2003, with an impressive 36 percent increase </p><p>in exports.  Total volume is close to USD 14 billion, and </p><p>analysts predict that exports will reach USD 40 billion for </p><p>the year, exceeding even the ambitious year-end target of 39 </p><p>billion.  Analysts see the possibility of an annual export </p><p>volume of up to USD 6 billion with Iraq, once trade is </p><p>normalized, arguing that Turkey is ideally positioned to </p><p>supply that country\'s consumer needs.  Meanwhile, in the last </p><p>quarter, the leading export items readywear and automotive </p><p>products recorded 28 and 66 percent increases respectively. </p><p>Suleyman Orakcioglu, head of the Istanbul Readywear </p><p>Exporters\' Union and creator of the successful "Damat" brand, </p><p>told us on May 6 that Turkish exporters gained valuable </p><p>experience after the 2001 crisis when domestic demand </p><p>plummeted and companies were forced to exploit international </p><p>markets.  Aggressive marketing is supported by the benefit </p><p>provided by the strong Euro in European markets, which </p><p>account for more than 50 percent of Turkey\'s exports. </p><p>Orakcioglu predicted that Turkish textile makers will also </p><p>benefit from the SARS epidemic in Asia, noting that they are </p><p>already seeing new orders from companies that are not </p><p>interested in travelling to the Far East.  He expressed </p><p>concern, however, that existing quota limits will prevent </p><p>Turkey from filling the expected additional demand from U.S. </p><p>customers. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Domestic Demand: The wild card in the deck remains </p><p>the ability of domestic demand to rebound and take the place </p><p>of stock accumulation, which accounted for the bulk of GDP </p><p>growth last year.  Initial indications are promising. </p><p>Industrial production grew 7.5 percent in the first quarter </p><p>on y-o-y terms, including a surprisingly strong 5.6 percent </p><p>in March, far exceeding analysts\' expectations of 1.3 </p><p>percent.  Earlier predictions of 0-2 percent growth for 2003 </p><p>have been revised to 4-5 percent by some analysts (in line </p><p>with the Central Bank survey\'s 3.7 percent).  Selected </p><p>retailers report up to a 30 percent increase in sales during </p><p>the past few weeks, and expect demand to increase further as </p><p>the uncertainty caused by the war recedes.  Domestic sales of </p><p>passenger cars and light commercial vehicles also rose 271 </p><p>percent in the first quarter (from an admittedly weak 2002 </p><p>figure-- the lowest in the last decade), while consumer </p><p>durables recorded a 20 percent increase.  These trends are </p><p>expected to continue as improving inflation performance and </p><p>declining interest rates spur the release of pent-up demand. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Comment: The mood on the Bosphorus is definitely </p><p>more hopeful than it was six weeks ago, but significant risk </p><p>factors remain.  Chief among them are continued government </p><p>implementation of the reform program and the strengthening </p><p>lira, which could begin to hurt Turkey\'s international </p><p>competitiveness.  Contrarians also note that while Turkish </p><p>markets always expect an easy summer, something usually </p><p>happens to change the picture-- from the Russia crisis in </p><p>1998 to early elections in 2002.  While no such event is on </p><p>the horizon, any such external or internal shock could easily </p><p>change the current picture, given the economy\'s underlying </p><p>fragility.  End Comment. </p><p>ARNETT </p><p></p></div>
