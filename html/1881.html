<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 002036 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR AF/W BOOTH, AF/RA BITTRICK </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 1.6X6 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MOPS, CM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: ARMY MINISTER ON BAKASSI PENINSULA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. DIA IIR 7 800 0243 01 </p><p>     B. YAOUNDE 2643 </p><p>     C. YAOUNDE 2449 </p><p>     D. STATE 137098 </p><p>     E. ABUJA 1889 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter; Reasons 1.6X6. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) After a meeting on security assistance at the Ministry </p><p>of Defense (septel), Ambassador had a private aside with the </p><p>Minister of State for Defense (Army), Lawal Batagarawa, on </p><p>the situation in the Bakassi Peninsula.  Batagarawa stated </p><p>that other than changing the military command structure in </p><p>the area (Ref A), which he noted Nigeria was trying to do </p><p>without an appearance of aggression, Nigeria had no plans to </p><p>take military action against Cameroon.  He explained that </p><p>Nigeria had no hostile intent, and no plans to take action </p><p>unless forced to respond to Cameroonian actions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The Ambassador asked about recent press reports of </p><p>exchanges of fire between Nigerian and Cameroonian forces </p><p>(Ref B).  Batagarawa explained that occasionally Nigerian </p><p>fishermen inadvertently cross the nominal border, which can </p><p>cause tensions to rise.  However, he claimed he had not heard </p><p>of any exchange of gunfire. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The Ambassador noted that the Embassy in Cameroon had </p><p>briefed the GOC on OFR, and had provided the coordinates for </p><p>training, so as to avoid misunderstandings (Ref C).  The </p><p>Minister thanked the Ambassador, and expressed his approval </p><p>of this action. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) COMMENT: We don\'t believe that Batagarawa was being </p><p>entirely forthcoming.  Despite what could become a very </p><p>serious situation in the Bakassi Peninsula, the GON has </p><p>downplayed the tensions there.  Other than some references in </p><p>the press to the Bakassi Peninsula, we have heard almost </p><p>nothing from our GON interlocutors.  It is possible that the </p><p>Nigerian military is using the disagreement over the Bakassi </p><p>Peninsula as a ruse to argue for additional resources. </p><p>However, MG Ogomudia\'s remarks and body language during the </p><p>recent OFR 3rd Group Battalion Commander\'s briefing (Ref E) </p><p>lead us to believe that the level of concern within the GON </p><p>may indeed be very high. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
