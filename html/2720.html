<p>UNCLAS ABUJA 001079 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>USAID/W FOR GH/AA, ANN PETERSON, DUFF GILLESPIE </p><p>AND FOR GH/HIV-AIDS, PAUL DELAY </p><p> </p><p>TAGS: NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA - HIV/AIDS ASSESSMENT </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary:  USAID/Nigeria would like to thank the Global </p><p>Bureau for Health for their recent assistance in assessing </p><p>our HIV/AIDS program.  The  participation of two US Direct </p><p>Hires with critical distinct expertise contributed greatly </p><p>to the successful analysis and cogent recommendations for </p><p>the way forward. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.   USAID/Nigeria recently hosted a team of experts to </p><p>assess our HIV/AIDS program, to determine progress to date </p><p>and to make recommendations for the way forward so as to </p><p>maximize U.S. dollar investment and program impact. </p><p>Participating on the team were: international and Nigerian </p><p>HIV/AIDS experts including Harriet Destler, Monitoring and </p><p>Evaluation Specialist; and Pam Wolf, Program Management </p><p>Specialist, of the Global Bureau for Health\'s HIV/AIDS </p><p>office. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. Because of Ms. Destler and Ms. Wolf\'s understanding of </p><p>HIV/AIDS within the context of USAID including USAID\'s </p><p>comparative advantages, programming mechanisms and </p><p>monitoring & evaluation requirements, they offered </p><p>exceptional insights that are of considerable value to the </p><p>Mission.  USAID/Nigeria is at a critical juncture in its </p><p>HIV/AIDS programming as it embarks on a strategic planning </p><p>exercise that will determine program direction for the 2004 </p><p>- 2009 time period.  The recent HIV/AIDS assessment will </p><p>not only lay the foundation for the Mission\'s HIV/AIDS </p><p>strategy, but has also provided the Mission with important </p><p>recommendations for adjustments to the current program. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. In light of the above experience and in reference to </p><p>the recent cable on support to the field from the GBH </p><p>HIV/AIDS Office, USAID/Nigeria would like to reiterate its </p><p>thanks and also indicate interest in further GBH assistance </p><p>to our HIV/AIDS program.  A subsequent cable will detail </p><p>our further needs for assistance. JETER </p><p></p></div>
