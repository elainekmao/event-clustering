(C) YOUR VISIT TO ZAGREB WILL TAKE PLACE JUST DAYS AFTER </p><p>CROATIA\'S FIRST ANP REVIEW AT NATO AND IN THE MIDST OF THE </p><p>GOC\'S PROCESS OF RE-DEFINING ITS RELATIONSHIPS WITH NATO\'S </p><p>OTHER CONTINUING ASPIRANTS.  BUT NATO IS NOT MUCH IN THE NEWS </p><p>IN ZAGREB THESE DAYS; FOCUS IS ON RELATIONS WITH ICTY, </p><p>CROATIA\'S APPLICATION FOR EU MEMBERSHIP, A DOCTOR\'S STRIKE </p><p>AND -- AS ALWAYS -- INTERNAL POLITICS.  YOUR VISIT SHOULD </p><p>HELP TO REMIND THE PUBLIC HERE THAT NATO STILL CONSIDERS </p><p>CROATIA A SERIOUS CANDIDATE BASED ON ITS OWN EFFORTS TO </p><p>PREPARE FOR MEMBERSHIP.  IT WILL ALSO BE AN EXCELLENT </p><p>OPPORTUNITY TO REINFORCE THE MESSAGE ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT </p><p>CIVIL SOCIETY REFORMS, INCLUDING REFUGEE RETURN AND </p><p>REINTEGRATION ARE TO THEIR CANDIDACY AND TO ENCOURAGE THE GOC </p><p>TO CONTINUE EFFORTS TO DOWNSIZE AND RESTRUCTURE THE ARMED </p><p>FORCES.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>NEW MOMENTUM FROM PRAGUE SUMMIT </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) BY THE TIME THE PRAGUE SUMMIT TOOK PLACE, THE PUBLIC </p><p>HERE WAS WELL-USED TO THE FACT THAT CROATIA WOULD NOT RECEIVE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00159  01 OF 04  221842Z </p><p>AN INVITATION.  WHILE THE GOC FAILED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE </p><p>SUMMIT AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO REINFORCE POPULAR SUPPORT FOR </p><p>NATO AT HOME, THEY DID USE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BEGIN TO </p><p>REDEFINE RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER CONTINUING ASPIRANTS.  EVEN </p><p>IF CRITICS CARPED, GOC OFFICIALS WHO ATTENDED THE SUMMIT </p><p>NOTED THE DIFFERENCE IN HOW CROATIA WAS TREATED AT PRAGUE AS </p><p>COMPARED TO THE WASHINGTON SUMMIT.  THEY TOOK THE "TOUGH </p><p>LOVE" MESSAGE ON BOARD, YET WERE ENCOURAGED BY THEIR </p><p>RECOGNITION AS A SERIOUS CANDIDATE WITH SERIOUS WORK TO DO. </p><p> </p><p>PRE-ELECTION POLITICS AN INCREASING DISTRACTION </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) THE COALITION LED BY PM RACAN\'S SDP JUST COMPLETED </p><p>ITS THIRD YEAR IN GOVERNMENT (SEE REF A FOR BROADER OUTLINE). </p><p> ALTHOUGH, BY LAW, ELECTIONS COULD BE HELD AS LATE AS APRIL </p><p>2004, MANY OBSERVERS PREDICT THEY WILL TAKE PLACE THIS </p><p>AUTUMN.  PRE-ELECTION CAMPAIGNING IS ALREADY WELL UNDERWAY </p><p>AND IS A SERIOUS DISTRACTION TO THOSE IN THE COALITION STILL </p><p>COMMITTED TO MOVING REFORMS ALONG.  RACAN\'S SDP IS FACED WITH </p><p>A RESURGENT HDZ WHILE AT THE SAME TIME HE IS TRYING TO KEEP </p><p>INCREASINGLY UNRULY SMALLER COALITION PARTNERS IN LINE.  ALL </p><p>TOO OFTEN, THE RESULT IS POLICY PARALYSIS EVEN ON THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S NARROW ELECTION-YEAR AGENDA. </p><p> </p><p>THE BOBETKO INDICTMENT: THE GOC\'S SELF-INFLICTED WOUND </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) THE GOC\'S MISHANDLING OF THE BOBETKO INDICTMENT </p><p>CRYSTALLIZED THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY\'S FRUSTRATION WITH </p><p>CROATIA\'S PROGRESS ON KEY REFORMS NEEDED FOR INTEGRATION IN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00159  01 OF 04  221842Z </p><p>EURO-ATLANTIC INSTITUTIONS.  THIS CHANGE IN APPROACH TO </p><p>CROATIA IS MOST DRAMATIC AMONG EU MEMBER STATES WHICH HAD </p><p>BEEN WILLING TO GIVE THE GOC THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT ON SOME </p><p>OF THE SOCIAL ISSUES WHICH HAVE THEIR ORIGINS IN THE ETHNIC </p><p>WAR OF THE PREVIOUS DECADE.  NO LONGER.  TWO EU MEMBER STATES </p><p>HAVE DELAYED CONSIDERATION OF CROATIA\'S STABILIZATION AND </p><p>ASSOCIATION AGREEMENT (SAA) PENDING A SATISFACTORY OUTCOME OF </p><p>THE BOBETKO CASE.  EU STATES ARE PRESSING THE GOC HARDER TO </p><p>APPREHEND 2001 ICTY INDICTEE GENERAL ANTE GOTOVINA, WHO </p><p>REMAINS AT LARGE. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) EVER SINCE THE GOVERNMENT FINALLY DELIVERED THE </p><p>INDICTMENT AGAINST BOBETKO TO THE LOCAL COURT OF </p><p>JURISDICTION, CROATIA HAS BEEN IN FORMAL COOPERATION WITH </p><p>ICTY.  A COURT-APPOINTED MEDICAL TEAM DETERMINED THAT BOBETKO </p><p>IS TOO ILL TO GO THROUGH THE STRESS OF THE INDICTMENT, LET </p><p>ALONE TRAVEL TO THE HAGUE.  AN ICTY MEDICAL TEAM WAS IN </p><p>ZAGREB ON JANUARY 15 TO REVIEW THE LOCAL MEDICAL FINDINGS AND </p><p>TO EXAMINE BOBETKO.  THE RESULTS OF THAT EXAMINATION WILL </p><p>SOON BE MADE PUBLIC.  THE WAVE OF EMOTIONAL NATIONALISM THAT </p><p>FOLLOWED ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE INDICTMENT HAS RECEDED, AND WITH </p><p>IT PM RACAN\'S REAL FEARS THAT HIS GOVERNMENT -- AND PUBLIC </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ3495 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  00159  02 OF 04  221842Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AF-00    AMAD-00  CIAE-00  DODE-00  PERC-00 </p><p>      DS-00    EAP-00   VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   VCE-00   MED-07 </p><p>      AC-01    NRRC-00  NSAE-00  PM-00    ACE-00   IRM-00   SSO-00 </p><p>      SS-00    R-00     SSD-00   PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-02 </p><p>      NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00    /010W </p><p>                  ------------------29D744  221843Z /38 </p><p>O 221828Z JAN 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 9266 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY BELGRADE PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY LJUBLJANA PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY SARAJEVO PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY SKOPJE PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY SOFIA PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY TIRANA PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY ROME PRIORITY </p><p>USMISSION USOSCE PRIORITY </p><p>USMISSION USNATO PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 04 ZAGREB 000159 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>EUR FOR DAS BRADTKE AND DAS BOGUE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/22/2013 </p><p>TAGS: NATO, PARM, PREL, PHUM, HR, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: SCENESETTER FOR DAS BOGUE AND BRADTKE VISIT TO </p><p>ZAGREB </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00159  02 OF 04  221842Z </p><p> </p><p>ORDER -- WERE IN DANGER.  WHAT REMAINS IS THE MISTRUST OF THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AND THE BITTERNESS OF SOME KEY GOC </p><p>OFFICIALS (LIKE DEPUTY PM GORAN GRANIC) WHO MIGHT HAVE CHOSEN </p><p>TO CONTINUE TO CHALLENGE WHAT THEY FEEL IS AN UNFAIR </p><p>INDICTMENT OF THE GOALS OF CROATIA\'S "HOMELAND WAR." </p><p> </p><p>EU MEMBERSHIP </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) WHILE CROATIA IS KEEN FOR NATO MEMBERSHIP, THE GOC\'S </p><p>TOP FOREIGN POLICY PRIORITY IS THE EU.  RACAN HAS RECENTLY </p><p>BEGUN A "EUROPEAN OFFENSIVE" AIMED AT GETTING CROATIA\'S </p><p>RELATIONSHIP WITH KEY MEMBER STATES BACK ON TRACK AFTER </p><p>BOBETKO.  THE GOC IS COMMITTED TO SUBMITTING FORMALLY ITS </p><p>APPLICATION FOR EU MEMBERSHIP IN THE SECOND HALF OF FEBRUARY. </p><p> ALTHOUGH WE UNDERSTAND INITIAL CONSIDERATION OF CROATIA\'S </p><p>APPLICATION IS TECHNICAL IN NATURE, IF CONSIDERATION IS </p><p>POSTPONED FOR POLITICAL REASONS, IT COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE </p><p>IMPACT ON THE ELECTORAL CHANCES OF PM RACAN\'S SDP. </p><p> </p><p>FAILURE ON REFUGEE RETURN </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) THE POLICY AREA IN WHICH THE RACAN GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>PROGRESS HAS BEEN MOST DISAPPOINTING IS REFUGEE RETURN AND </p><p>RESETTLEMENT.  THE LEVEL OF GOC INACTION AND LACK OF </p><p>COLLABORATION IS REACHING A POINT WHERE THE LOCAL </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IS CONSIDERING PULLING OUT OF </p><p>COLLABORATIVE MECHANISMS (THE JOINT LEGAL WORKING GROUP) TO </p><p>PREVENT THE GOC FROM CLAIMING IN THEIR EU "CHARM OFFENSIVE" </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00159  02 OF 04  221842Z </p><p>THAT IT IS ENGAGED WITH US ON REFUGEE RETURN ISSUES.  DESPITE </p><p>CHANGES IN KEY LAWS AND A SERIES OF COMMITMENTS TO THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, THE NUMBER OF ETHNIC SERBS RETURNING </p><p>TO THEIR HOMES IS FAR BELOW WHAT IT SHOULD BE.  LEGAL AND </p><p>ADMINISTRATIVE BARRIERS REMAIN DESPITE GOC ASSERTIONS TO THE </p><p>CONTRARY.  THE REASONS FOR THIS FAILURE VARY, AND WE DON\'T </p><p>EXPECT YOU TO ENGAGE WITH YOUR GOC INTERLOCUTORS ON THE </p><p>SUBSTANCE OF THIS COMPLEX ISSUE ON THIS VISIT.  YOUR MESSAGE </p><p>SHOULD BE STRAGHTFORWARD: THE CONSENSUS OF THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>COMMUNITY IS THAT CROATIA IS NOT TAKING THIS ISSUE SERIOUSLY. </p><p> UNTIL CROATIA MAKES A REAL COMMITMENT AND PRODUCES </p><p>SIGNIFICANT RESULTS, ITS CANDIDACY FOR MEMBERSHIP IN </p><p>EURO-ATLANTIC INSTITUTIONS WILL NOT BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY. </p><p> </p><p>STRONG SUPPORT FOR THE WAR ON TERROR </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) CROATIA RATES HIGH PRAISE FOR ITS COMMITMENT TO THE </p><p>WAR AGAINST TERRORISM.  FROM ITS IMMEDIATE STATEMENTS OF </p><p>POLITICAL SUPPORT IN SOLIDARITY WITH US TO ITS CONTRIBUTIONS </p><p>OF HUMANITARIAN AND MILITARY ASSISTANCE TO AFGHANISTAN TO ITS </p><p>DECISION TO DEPLOY A MILITARY POLICE UNIT TO ISAF, THE GOC </p><p>HAS CONSISTENTLY BEEN IN THE FRONT RANKS OF THE GLOBAL WAR ON </p><p>TERROR.  YOUR EXPRESSIONS OF APPRECIATION WILL BE WELCOME IN </p><p>YOUR MEETINGS WITH GOC OFFICIALS AND IN YOUR STATEMENTS TO </p><p>THE MEDIA.  (NOTE: A SCHEDULE CHANGE HAS DELAYED THE FIRST </p><p>GREEK AIRLIFT OF CROATIA\'S DONATION OF WEAPONS AND MUNITIONS </p><p>TO THE ANA.  END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>IRAQ </p><p>---- </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00159  02 OF 04  221842Z </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) ON IRAQ, OFFICIAL CROATIA SEEMS TO BE FOLLOWING THE </p><p>STANDARD EUROPEAN LINE.  THE GOC ISSUED A STATEMENT CALLING </p><p>FOR IRAQ TO "DEMONSTRATE THAT IT DOES NOT PRESENT A THREAT" </p><p>TO INTERNATIONAL SECURITY (REF C), BUT ALSO EXPRESSING ANGST </p><p>THAT ANY ACTION SHOULD BE SANCTIONED BY UN MECHANISMS.  THE </p><p>MFA ESTABLISHED A TASK FORCE TO TRACK THE IRAQ ISSUE (WE ARE </p><p>ENGAGING WITH THE TASK FORCE TO USE IT AS ANOTHER CONDUIT FOR </p><p>USG VIEWS), BUT THE GOVERNMENT IS GENERALLY KEEPING A LOW </p><p>PROFILE ON IRAQ.  FM PICULA, FRESH FROM A TRIP TO THE </p><p>MID-EAST HAS IN SEVERAL CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>EXPRESSED HIS CONCERN ABOUT THE EFFECT THERE OF A POSSIBLE </p><p>WAR IN IRAQ. </p><p> </p><p>CONVENTIONAL/DUAL-USE PROLIFERATION </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) IN SEPTEMBER 2001, AT OUR URGING, CROATIA CANCELLED </p><p>A CONTRACT FOR HIGH-SPEED PATROL BOATS TO IRAN; THE SHIPYARD </p><p>WHICH WAS TO HAVE BENEFITED FROM THE CONTRACT WENT BANKRUPT </p><p>AND AN ITALIAN FIRM APPARENTLY NOW HAS THE CONTRACT WITH </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ3496 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  00159  03 OF 04  221843Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AF-00    AMAD-00  CIAE-00  DODE-00  PERC-00 </p><p>      DS-00    EAP-00   VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   VCE-00   MED-07 </p><p>      AC-01    NRRC-00  NSAE-00  PM-00    ACE-00   IRM-00   SSO-00 </p><p>      SS-00    R-00     SSD-00   PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-02 </p><p>      NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00    /010W </p><p>                  ------------------29D764  221843Z /38 </p><p>O 221828Z JAN 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 9267 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY BELGRADE PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY LJUBLJANA PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY SARAJEVO PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY SKOPJE PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY SOFIA PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY TIRANA PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY ROME PRIORITY </p><p>USMISSION USOSCE PRIORITY </p><p>USMISSION USNATO PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 04 ZAGREB 000159 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>EUR FOR DAS BRADTKE AND DAS BOGUE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/22/2013 </p><p>TAGS: NATO, PARM, PREL, PHUM, HR, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: SCENESETTER FOR DAS BOGUE AND BRADTKE VISIT TO </p><p>ZAGREB </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00159  03 OF 04  221843Z </p><p> </p><p>IRAN.  (THE GOC IS EITHER UNAWARE OF THIS OR HAS CHOSEN NOT </p><p>TO POINT IT OUT TO US.  SOONER OR LATER, WORD THAT THIS </p><p>HAPPENED WILL GET AROUND; HOW WE HANDLE IT WILL BE DECISIVE </p><p>TO FUTURE GOC COOPERATION ON SUCH DEALS.)  NOW, THE GOC IS </p><p>DEBATING WHETHER TO PROCEED -- OVER OUR OBJECTIONS -- WITH A </p><p>CONTRACT TO REFIT A LIBYAN NAVY DIVER SUPPORT VESSEL.  WE </p><p>KNOW OUR PRESSURE HAS HAD A BIG THOUGH NOT YET CLEARLY </p><p>DECISIVE IMPACT.  WE LOOK TO YOUR VISIT TO HELP KEEP THE </p><p>PRESSURE ON THE GOC TO REJECT THE CONTRACT AND OTHER CONTACTS </p><p>WHICH COULD LEAD TO TRANSFERS OF LETHAL MILITARY EQUIPMENT TO </p><p>STATE SPONSORS OF TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>STALLED PROGRESS ON MOD RESTRUCTURING AND DOWNSIZING </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) DEFENSE REFORMS, BEGUN LATE LAST YEAR, ARE </p><p>PROGRESSING SLOWLY.  REORGANIZATION OF THE MOD AND CROATIAN </p><p>ARMED FORCES IS HAMPERED BY A DYSFUNCTIONAL PERSONNEL </p><p>MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AND A LACK OF FUNDING FOR THE MOD\'S </p><p>AMBITIOUS AND COSTLY -- ALBEIT ESSENTIAL -- DOWNSIZING </p><p>PROGRAM.  THE DEFENSE REFORM PROCESS HAS GAINED NEW MOMENTUM </p><p>WITH THE APPOINTMENT OF A MORE DYNAMIC NEW DEFENSE MINISTER, </p><p>DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER ZELJKA ANTUNOVIC (SDP).  TWO OF THE </p><p>CHALLENGES ANTUNOVIC MUST FACE ARE A SHRINKING DEFENSE </p><p>BUDGET, 70 PERCENT OF WHICH IS DEVOTED TO PERSONNEL COSTS, </p><p>AND A MILITARY ELITE THAT IS MISTRUSTFUL OF HER LEADERSHIP. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) ANTUNOVIC HAS OBTAINED POLITICAL APPROVAL FOR A </p><p>FAR-REACHING RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM, BUT IMPLEMENTATION HAS </p><p>BEEN SLOWED BY POLITICAL BICKERING.  THE GOC HAS BEGUN TO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00159  03 OF 04  221843Z </p><p>MOVE FORWARD ON DOWNSIZING THE CROATIAN ARMED FORCES (CAF) </p><p>AND THE MOD, A STEP ESSENTIAL FOR BUILDING A </p><p>NATO-INTEROPERABLE FORCE.  A DETAILED, NATO-APPROVED, BUT </p><p>VERY EXPENSIVE DOWNSIZING PLAN REMAINS ON THE SHELF AS THE </p><p>GOC SEEKS EXTERNAL SOURCES OF FUNDING TO HELP IMPLEMENT IT. </p><p>ANTUNOVIC ANNOUNCED SHE WILL MOVE FORWARD WITH A </p><p>SELF-FINANCED PILOT PROGRAM TO ENCOURAGE 400 MOD EMPLOYEES, </p><p>BOTH CIVILIAN AND MILITARY, TO LEAVE THE RANKS.  BUT </p><p>ESTIMATES SAY THAT TO "RIGHT-SIZE" THE CAF MUST LAY OFF OR </p><p>OFFER EARLY RETIREMENT TO MORE THAN 10,000 PERSONNEL, NEARLY </p><p>ALL OF WHOM ARE VETERANS OF CROATIA\'S HOMELAND WAR.  IN YOUR </p><p>MEETING, ANTUNOVIC MAY ASK FOR INCREASED U.S. SUPPORT TO FUND </p><p>DOWNSIZING.  OUR ONLY ENGAGEMENT ON THIS ISSUE IS A PUBLIC </p><p>INFORMATION PROJECT AIMED AT BUILDING SUPPORT FOR THIS POLICY </p><p>GOAL, BEYOND THIS MODEST PROJECT, THERE IS NO ROOM IN OUR </p><p>ASSISTANCE BUDGET TO FUND DOWNSIZING.  ANTUNOVIC WILL ALSO </p><p>MENTION CROATIA\'S CONTINUED SUPPORT TO THE COALITION AGAINST </p><p>TERRORISM AND WILL SEEK TO EXPLORE AREAS WHERE U.S. </p><p>ASSISTANCE IS NEEDED TO SECURE CROATIA\'S MARITIME BORDER AND </p><p>COUNTER WMD PROLIFERATION. </p><p> </p><p>BILATERAL MILITARY COOPERATION </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C) U.S. MILITARY COOPERATION WITH CROATIA SURGED AFTER </p><p>THE 2000 ELECTIONS, BUT THE NUMBER OF BILATERAL EXERCISES </p><p>DROPPED IN THE FOLLOWING TWO YEARS AS OUR FORCES HAVE BEEN </p><p>ENGAGED ELSEWHERE.  RESTRICTIONS TO OUR ENGAGEMENT IN CROATIA </p><p>ARE CREEPING IN AT THE LEGAL LEVEL: UNWORKABLE RESTRICTIONS </p><p>PREVENTING NUCLEAR POWERED VESSELS FROM ANCHORING IN CROATIAN </p><p>TERRITORIAL WATERS, ISSUES PREVENTING SHIPS FROM IMPLEMENTING </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00159  03 OF 04  221843Z </p><p>POST-USS COLE FORCE PROTECTION PROCEDURES (AND THEREBY </p><p>PREVENTING USN SHIP VISITS), AND PUBLIC OBJECTIONS TO </p><p>EXERCISES DURING THE CONSTANTLY-EXPANDING TOURIST SEASON NOW </p><p>TOP THE LIST.  DASD RICARDEL\'S DELEGATION (SEE BELOW) WILL </p><p>ADDRESS THESE ISSUES IN DEPTH DURING ITS VISIT, BUT RAISING </p><p>THE ISSUE IN YOUR CONVERSATIONS WOULD FLAG IT FOR THE GOC\'S </p><p>ATTENTION. </p><p> </p><p>CROATIA\'S BUSY POL-MIL SCHEDULE </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C) CROATIA\'S POLITICAL-MILITARY POLICY MAKERS HAVE A </p><p>VERY FULL DANCE CARD FOR THE NEXT FEW WEEKS.  IN ADDITION TO </p><p>YOUR VISIT AND THE ANP REVIEW, CROATIA IS ACTIVELY DRAFTING </p><p>AN "ADRIATIC CHARTER" WITH ALBANIA AND MACEDONIA (REF B).  AS </p><p>YOU KNOW, BRUCE JACKSON WAS IN ZAGREB FOR MEETINGS, INCLUDING </p><p>WITH FM PICULA.  DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF DEFENSE MIRA </p><p>RICARDEL WILL BE IN ZAGREB WITH A DELEGATION FROM FEBRUARY 3 </p><p>- 6 FOR THE BILATERAL DEFENSE CONSULTATIONS.
