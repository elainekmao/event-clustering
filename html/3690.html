<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 AMMAN 005185 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARN, NEA/PA, NEA/AIA, INR/NESA, R/MR, </p><p>I/GNEA, B/BXN, B/BRN, NEA/PPD </p><p>USAID/ANE/MEA </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH </p><p>PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p>USCINCCENT/CCPA, USCENTCOM REAR MACDILL AFB FL </p><p>NICOSIA FOR ILMG </p><p>STATE PASS TO AID </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KMDR JO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDAN: MEDIA REACTION ON SEPTEMBER 11 </p><p>ANNIVERSARY, IRAQ, OCCUPIED TERRITORIES </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>JORDANIAN DAILIES ON SEPTEMBER 11 WERE OVERWHELMINGLY </p><p>DOMINATED BY THE SEPTEMBER 11 ANNIVERSARY, THE </p><p>SITUATION IN IRAQ, AND THE U.S. REACTION TO ARAFAT\'S </p><p>SPEECH. </p><p> </p><p>MOST EDITORIAL WRITERS COMMENTED ON THE SEPTEMBER 11 </p><p>ANNIVERSARY.  COMMENTARIES REFLECTED A MIXTURE OF </p><p>SYMPATHY WITH THE BEREAVED FAMILIES, COUPLED WITH FEAR </p><p>OF, AND ANGER AGAINST U.S. POLICY, PARTICULARLY IN </p><p>PALESTINE AND IRAQ. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NEWS REPORTS </p><p> </p><p>THE ANNIVERSARY OF SEPTEMBER 11 DOMINATED NEWS REPORTS </p><p>ON SEPTEMBER 11, AND TWO OF THE THREE MAIN ARABIC </p><p>DAILIES PRODUCED SPECIAL EDITIONS MARKING THE OCCASION. </p><p>NEWS COVERAGE CONCENTRATED ON THE SECURITY PRECAUTIONS </p><p>BEING TAKEN TO AVOID FURTHER ATTACKS ON THE DAY. </p><p> </p><p>COVERAGE OF THE IRAQI CRISIS COMPRISED TWO ELEMENTS: </p><p>THE MESSAGE FROM SADDAM HUSSEIN TO KING ABDULLAH, WHICH </p><p>WAS DELIVERED BY IRAQI VICE-PRESIDENT TAHA YASSIN </p><p>RAMADAN.  NEWSPAPERS REPORTED THAT THE KING ASSURED </p><p>RAMADAN OF JORDAN\'S EFFORTS TO PREVENT AN ATTACK ON HIS </p><p>COUNTRY. </p><p> </p><p>ALL DAILIES REPORTED THE U.S. DISMISSAL OF ARAFAT\'S </p><p>SPEECH IN WHICH HE CALLED FOR A HALT ON OPERATIONS </p><p>AGAINST ISRAELI CIVILIANS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL COMMENTARIES </p><p> </p><p>-- WHO WILL LEARN THE LESSON AND STAND UP FOR HUMANITY? </p><p> </p><p>THE LEADER COMMENTARY IN SEMI-OFFICIAL INFLUENTIAL </p><p>ARABIC DAILY AL-RAI ON SEPTEMBER 11 READ: "THE PEOPLES </p><p>AND NATIONS OF THE WORLD STOOD IN CLEAR SYMPATHY WITH </p><p>THE VICTIMS AND THEIR FAMILIES, THEY SUPPORTED THE </p><p>AMERICAN CAMPAIGN AGAINST TERROR, AND THEY SEEMED </p><p>UNITED IN REALIZING THE UGLINESS OF THE ATTACKS AND THE </p><p>SAVAGERY OF THE POLITICAL MOTIVES BEHIND THEM.  BUT THE </p><p>CHANGES IN PRIORITIES OF AMERICA\'S WAR ON TERROR, AND </p><p>THE U.S. REFUSAL TO DEAL WITH THE CAUSES OF TERRORISM </p><p>HAVE CREATED DISILLUSIONMENT AMONG PEOPLES AND </p><p>DEMOCRATIC REGIMES IN THE WORLD.  IN THE DAYS THAT </p><p>FOLLOWED SEPTEMBER 11 THERE EMERGED A STATE OF HATRED </p><p>AND RACIST INCITEMENT AGAINST ALL THAT IS ARAB AND </p><p>MUSLIM, WHICH RESULTED IN SUMMARY ARRESTS AND ATTACKS, </p><p>DESPITE SOME SANE VOICES THAT SAW THE WAR AS BEING </p><p>AGAINST TERROR NOT ISLAM.  THE AMERICAN MOVES AGAINST </p><p>TERROR WOULD GAIN CREDIBILITY AND RESPECT BY ADOPTING A </p><p>SINGLE STANDARD IN DEFINING TERRORISM, AND IN </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGING THAT OCCUPATION IS THE WORST FORM OF </p><p>TERRORISM; SO IS PREVENTING PEOPLES FROM SELF- </p><p>DETERMINATION AND ELECTING THE LEADERSHIPS THAT THEY </p><p>CHOSE DEMOCRATICALLY.  THIS FORM OF TERRORISM IS NOT </p><p>ANNULLED BY POWER OR UNILATERALISM." </p><p> </p><p>-- THE EMBASSY\'S PAMPHLETS AND PEOPLE\'S CONVICTIONS </p><p> </p><p>PROMINENT DAILY COLUMNIST TARIQ MASARWAH WROTE IN SEMI- </p><p>OFFICIAL INFLUENTIAL ARABIC DAILY AL-RAI ON SEPTEMBER </p><p>11: "THE U.S. EMBASSY DROWNED US IN ITS KINDNESS BY </p><p>ADDRESSING US AS `DEAR FRIEND\' IN A LETTER THAT </p><p>ACCOMPANIED AN INFORMATION KIT MARKING SEPTEMBER 11. </p><p>BUT THE AMERICAN POLITICAL DISCOURSE IS NOT INTERESTED </p><p>IN ADDRESSING PEOPLE AND GAINING THEIR SUPPORT.  IT </p><p>SAYS: `YOU ARE EITHER WITH ME OR WITH THE TERRORISTS," </p><p>AND: `WE SHALL GO TO WAR WHETHER THE UN, OUR ALLIES, </p><p>AND OUR FRIENDS AGREE OR NOT."  THIS IS NOT THE </p><p>ATTITUDE OF SOMEONE WHO CARES ABOUT THE OPINION OF A </p><p>HUMBLE JORDANIAN JOURNALIST NOR THAT OF ALL JORDANIANS. </p><p>WE HOPE THAT THE U.S. EMBASSY IN THE FUTURE WILL </p><p>PROVIDE US WITH BOOKS ABOUT `ARIEL SHARON THE MAN OF </p><p>PEACE,\' ABOUT THE USE OF F16S AND APACHES, WHICH ARE </p><p>WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION, AGAINST THE TOWNS OF </p><p>PALESTINE, ABOUT THE NOBILITY OF THE ISRAELI </p><p>OCCUPATION, AND ABOUT THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE U.S. </p><p>PRESIDENT\'S SIGNATURE ON THE OSLO ACCORD." </p><p> </p><p>-- WHY WASHINGTON DOES NOT ALLOW US TO FEEL SYMPATHY OR </p><p>COMPASSION </p><p> </p><p>FORMER PRESS ADVISOR TO KING HUSSEIN KHALED MAHADIN </p><p>WROTE IN SEMI-OFFICIAL INFLUENTIAL ARABIC DAILY AL-RAI </p><p>ON SEPTEMBER 11: "NO SANE PERSON WOULD DENY THAT </p><p>KILLING CIVILIANS IS A TRAVESTY AGAINST DIVINE </p><p>RELIGIONS, HUMAN VALUES, AND ALL CODES OF MORALITY. </p><p>BUT THE AMERICAN REACTION TO THIS EVENT WAS AN OPEN </p><p>CALL FOR REVENGE AGAINST ARAB AND MUSLIM CIVILIANS, AND </p><p>THAT CALL WAS PUT INTO ACTION.  WHAT THE COUNTRIES THAT </p><p>OPPOSE RELIGIONS, HUMAN RIGHTS, AND MORAL VALUES SEEK </p><p>IS REVENGE FOR THE INNOCENT VICTIMS OF NEW YORK AND </p><p>WASHINGTON.  BUT IT IS DIFFICULT TO ACCEPT THE LOGIC OF </p><p>FACING TERRORISM BY INDIVIDUALS WITH STATE TERRORISM. </p><p>IF WE ACCEPT THAT A KILLER SHOULD BE KILLED, THEN WE </p><p>SHOULD ALL AGREE ON A BIGGER PRINCIPLE, THAT KILLING </p><p>TENS OF THOUSANDS OF INNOCENT PEOPLE TO AVENGE A FEW </p><p>HUNDRED OR EVEN A THOUSAND EQUALLY INNOCENT PEOPLE IS </p><p>REAL TERRORISM, WHICH ROBS AN OBSERVER OF ANY CAPACITY </p><p>FOR COMPASSION.   WHAT SEPTEMBER 11 CONFIRMED IS THAT </p><p>THE WEST HAS BORNE AN OBJECTIVE FOR DECADES, WHICH IS </p><p>TO DESTROY ISLAM AND TO CONVERT TRUE CHRISTIANITY INTO </p><p>A WESTERN STYLE CHRISTIANITY THAT GIVES INDULGENCES TO </p><p>THE AMERICAN WAR MACHINE." </p><p> </p><p>-- WHAT HAPPENED? </p><p> </p><p>THE LEADER COMMENTARY IN CENTRIST, INFLUENTIAL AMONG </p><p>THE ELITE ENGLISH DAILY JORDAN TIMES ON SEPTEMBER 11 </p><p>READ: "AS THE UNITED STATES MOURNS THE INNOCENT VICTIMS </p><p>OF THE PREMEDITATED ASSAULTS ON MAJOR AMERICAN </p><p>LANDMARKS ONE YEAR AGO, ARAB COUNTRIES CAN ONLY WONDER: </p><p>WHAT HAPPENED?  IN THE AFTERMATH OF A RAGTAG BOMB- </p><p>DROPPING CAMPAIGN, AFGHANISTAN LOOKS MORE CHAOTIC.WITH </p><p>AN INTERIM PRESIDENT DESPERATE FOR FUNDS TO REBUILD, IF </p><p>HE CAN STAY ALIVE LONG ENOUGH TO DO SO.  USAMA BIN </p><p>LADEN HAS FADED FROM THE HEADLINES, AFTER PENTAGON </p><p>OFFICIALS PREDICTED CAPTURING HIM BY LAST CHRISTMAS. </p><p>SADDAM HUSSEIN HAS REAPPEARED ON THE SCENE AS AMERICA\'S </p><p>MOST WANTED MAN. MEANWHILE, AS THE PALESTINIANS COPE </p><p>WITH A BARRAGE OF BULLETS, BOMBS AND BULLDOZERS, </p><p>PRESIDENT BUSH LECTURES THEIR LEADERSHIP ON THE </p><p>NECESSITY TO ADOPT MORE DEMOCRATIC PROCEDURES AND </p><p>PRODUCE A CONSTITUTION - A DOCUMENT THAT ISRAEL ITSELF </p><p>LACKS. IT IS THE ALIENATION OF AMERICA\'S FRIENDS IN THE </p><p>AREA THAT FURTHERS THE GOALS OF EXTREMISTS EVERYWHERE. </p><p>WITH A TACIT GREEN LIGHT OF ISRAEL\'S DAILY OPPRESSION </p><p>AND A SO-CALLED AXIS OF EVIL THAT INCLUDES TWO OF THREE </p><p>ARAB STATES, IT IS NOT DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND WHY </p><p>PUBLIC SYMPATHY FOR THE U.S. HAS DRIED UP IN THE PAST </p><p>YEAR." </p><p> </p><p>-- WILL IT LEARN THE LESSON? </p><p> </p><p>FORMER DIRECTOR OF PRESS AND PUBLICATIONS BILAL AL-TAL </p><p>WROTE IN INDEPENDENT WEEKLY AL-LIWA\' (THE BANNER) ON </p><p>SEPTEMBER 11: "ONE OF THE MOST REMARKABLE CONSEQUENCES </p><p>OF THE SEPTEMBER 11 ATTACKS IS THAT THEY MADE USAMA BIN </p><p>LADEN THE MOST FAMOUS MAN IN THE WORLD.  WHETHER WE </p><p>LIKE IT OR NOT, HE HAS BECOME A ROLE MODEL FOR A LARGE </p><p>NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN MANY PARTS OF THE WORLD. THE REASON </p><p>IS NOT ADMIRATION FOR THE PERSON OR HIS IDEOLOGICAL OR </p><p>SOCIAL THOUGHT, FOR HE DOES NOT PRESENT HIMSELF AS A </p><p>MAN OF THOUGHT IN THE FIRST PLACE.  HE MERELY DESCRIBES </p><p>THE ROLE THAT HE DREW FOR HIMSELF, AS INCITING PEOPLE </p><p>TO REBEL AGAINST THEIR CHAINS AND SEEK FREEDOM.  THIS </p><p>IS WHY SO MANY PEOPLE ADMIRE HIM.  IN ADDITION, HE DID </p><p>NOT STOP AT CURSING IMPERIALISM, BUT TARGETED AMERICA </p><p>ITSELF, WHICH INSPIRED ALL THE PEOPLES THAT HAVE </p><p>SUFFERED FROM AMERICA\'S POLICIES.  USAMA BIN LADEN IS A </p><p>CASE THAT MERITS STUDY AND REFLECTION.  IT WOULD NOT BE </p><p>SUFFICIENT TO CURSE HIM ON THE MEDIA AND LAY PLANS FOR </p><p>HIS DEATH IN THE DARK CORRIDORS OF SECURITY AGENCIES, </p><p>BECAUSE IDEAS DO NOT DIE WITH THE DEATH OF THOSE WHO </p><p>BELIEVE IN THEM.  THEY CAN ONLY BE DEFEATED BY MORE </p><p>POWERFUL THOUGHTS AND PRACTICES.  UNLESS THE U.S. </p><p>REVISES ITS POLICIES, AND UNLESS THE PEOPLES OF THE </p><p>WORLD GAIN THEIR FREEDOM, THEN THE WORLD WILL REMAIN A </p><p>FERTILE GROUND THAT PRODUCES MANY LIKE USAMA BIN LADEN. </p><p>SO, A YEAR AFTER THE SEPTEMBER 11 ATTACKS, WE SAY THAT </p><p>THE U.S. HAS NOT SUCCEEDED IN CAPTURING BIN LADEN </p><p>BECAUSE THERE ARE PEOPLE READY TO HARBOR HIM, BECAUSE </p><p>THEY BELIEVE THAT HE IS DEFENDING THE RIGHTS OF A </p><p>NATION THAT THE U.S. SEEKS TO USURP."
