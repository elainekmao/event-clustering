Participants enjoyed the study case immensely as it </p><p>touched on the most important issue women face when </p><p>participating in politics, which is the resistance women </p><p>face and the limited social settings for women to express </p><p>and participate with men in discussion and decision-making. </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) Outcome: Strengths </p><p> </p><p>      Workshops reached 300 women in five governorates and </p><p>     received attention from officials and civil society. </p><p>    Some of the speakers were women local council members </p><p>which gave participants opportunity to listen to their </p><p>experiences and get first hand information of women\'s </p><p>experience in the public and political life. </p><p>    Several district local council members in each </p><p>governorate attended the workshop and benefited from the </p><p>subjects presented and the discussions. </p><p>    Participants\' evaluations of the workshops were very </p><p>positive. Participants acknowledged their dire need to these </p><p>workshops at the governorate levels and the knowledge they </p><p>gain from them as they touch upon very important and current </p><p>women issues. </p><p>    Participation of officials in the workshops showed the </p><p>government\'s support for women empowerment and development. </p><p>    WIDA\'s capacity and efficiency in conducting the </p><p>program in five governorates was evident in the </p><p>participants\' evaluation of the workshops, media coverage </p><p>and visual and written documentation of the program. </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) Outcome: Weaknesses </p><p> </p><p>      In Taiz governorate, the workshop faced resistance from </p><p>     some officials. However, the workshop was well received </p><p>     among the community. </p><p>    In Lahaj, the general secretary was assigned to present </p><p>a paper. But the paper was presented by someone else which </p><p>made discussion of paper subject useless since the general </p><p>secretary was not present to respond. </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>    In Mahweet, participants were less outspoken as the </p><p>area is still conservative and requires more awareness </p><p>programs and advocacy in regards to women participation. </p><p>     HULL </p><p></p></div>
