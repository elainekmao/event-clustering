<p>S E C R E T SANAA 001191 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR NEA, NEA/ARP, NEA/EX, S/CT, CA, DS/IP, </p><p>DS/IP/NEA, DS/DSS/ITA, DS/ICI/PII, CENTCOM FOR POLAD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/27/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ASEC, AMGT, PREL, PTER, CASC, YM, EAC, COUNTER TERRORISM </p><p>SUBJECT: SANAA EAC MEETING MAY 27 </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 137077 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edmund J. Hull, for Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S/NF)  Summary:  The Ambassador convened an Emergency </p><p>Action Committee (EAC) meeting on May 27 to assess Embassy </p><p>security posture in light of recent unspecified threat </p><p>information.  Post is working closely with ROYG to review </p><p>security, and continues to endorse the return of minor </p><p>dependents.  EAC also discussed confusion surrounding the </p><p>text of a recent travel warning.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S/NF)   Key offices and personnel represented at the </p><p>5/27 EAC meeting included: ADMIN, AMB, CONS, DCM, FPD, </p><p>LEGATT, MSG, OMC, ORCA, PD, POL/ECON, RSO, and SOC YEMEN. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S/NF)  LEGATT, ORCA, and RSO reported ongoing efforts to </p><p>clarify unspecified threat information recently provided by a </p><p>U.S. law enforcement agency.  Post has identified no specific </p><p>area of concern based on this information, and numerous </p><p>security enhancements are already in place including </p><p>increased security at the Hadda and Tourist City compounds </p><p>and the Sheraton Hotel.  Efforts are underway to seek </p><p>clarification of the information. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>Minor Dependents </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S/NF)  In light of recent events in the region, members </p><p>of the EAC reviewed and upheld post\'s decision to recommend </p><p>the return of minor dependents.  Several participants noted </p><p>the impossibility of proving a negative, i.e. that no </p><p>terrorist strike against U.S. interests would occur in Yemen, </p><p>despite the absence of information indicating a current </p><p>threat.  The Ambassador noted that work undertaken to enhance </p><p>the security posture of U.S.-related sites after the attacks </p><p>in Riyadh and Casablanca demonstrates the continuing </p><p>effectiveness of security cooperation with ROYG authorities. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (S/NF)  The EAC noted that, in March 2002, post requested </p><p>and received approval for the return of adult dependents. </p><p>Eighteen months later the security measures employed by Post </p><p>with ROYG cooperation have proven effective.  No adult </p><p>dependent has been targeted, victimized, or identified as a </p><p>security liability.  Post reiterates its recommendation for </p><p>the return of minor dependents. </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>Travel Warning </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (S/NF)  EAC members expressed concern over confusion </p><p>caused by a recent travel warning announcing the cancellation </p><p>of authorized departure while reiterating advice to American </p><p>citizens to leave Yemen.  Some Embassy contacts apparently </p><p>interpreted this announcement as an indication of a new </p><p>threat and a signal of the Embassy\'s eminent closure.  EAC </p><p>members will review the text of the announcement to identify </p><p>areas that should be considered for revision. </p><p> </p><p>HULL </p><p></p></div>
