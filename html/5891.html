<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KUWAIT 000651 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT. FOR NEA/ARP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/04/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KISL, PGOV, PINR, KU </p><p>SUBJECT: KUWAIT,S ISLAMISTS: THEY NEED US BUT THEY DON\'T </p><p>TRUST US </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: (U) Ambassador Richard H. Jones for reasons 1.5 (b) and </p><p>(d) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: Poloffs have met with a number of influential </p><p> Kuwaiti Islamists to discuss their views of the U.S. </p><p>presence in Kuwait and the region.  Almost all of them </p><p>defined the U.S. role in the world as that of the current </p><p>imperial power and predicted the eventual downfall of the </p><p>U.S. "empire."  Some support, but most oppose war to </p><p>eliminate Saddam.  Accusing the U.S. of trying to impose its </p><p>value system on the region, they argued that the U.S. </p><p>maintains a presence here solely to control and/or "steal" </p><p>the oil wealth of the region, and would be much better off if </p><p>we left the values of the local peoples ) which they do not </p><p>see as largely shared with the West ) to be dealt with as </p><p>domestic issues.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>America as an Imperial Power </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>2. (C) The Islamists we spoke with -- ranging from the </p><p>ostensibly moderate Islamic Constitutional Movement (ICM, the </p><p>Kuwaiti Muslim Brotherhood and its social welfare arm, the </p><p>Social Reform Society(SRS)) through the Salafis to the </p><p>reactionary Scientific Salafis -- view the U.S. presence in </p><p>the Middle East as the latest in a long historical line of </p><p>foreign occupying powers.  Much as the Persians, Ottomans and </p><p>British once ruled the lands of the Middle East, they say, so </p><p>now does the U.S. control the region and its natural </p><p>resources.  And like them, the "U.S. empire," too, will fall </p><p>someday.   The U.S. empire has reached its zenith, said </p><p>Kuwaiti Social Reform Society Secretary General Shaykh Jassem </p><p>Muhalhal al-Yaseen, and is striving to maintain this position </p><p>through "technological advancement.... We don,t care if it </p><p>stays or falls down, but for you it is important to stay </p><p>there." </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) But while they predict the inevitable failure of the </p><p>United States in the region, many of Kuwait\'s Islamists claim </p><p>not to fault the U.S. for looking after its interests here. </p><p>According to al-Yaseen, the U.S. has the "right" as the sole </p><p>superpower to view the world as territory to "be conquered." </p><p> Or as outspoken local editorialist and ICM Executive </p><p>Committee Member Dr. Ismail al-Shatti said, "The law of </p><p>history tells us superpowers should act as superpowers to </p><p>control fragile states." </p><p> </p><p>The "Real" U.S. Interests </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>4. (C) Kuwaiti Islamist perceptions of U.S. interests in the </p><p>region, however, differ greatly from our stated goals here. </p><p>Despite their first-hand experience of the U.S.-led </p><p>liberation of Kuwait, and their universal expression to us of </p><p>appreciation for that role, many Kuwaiti Islamists find it </p><p>hard to believe that U.S. interests go beyond the maintenance </p><p>of the price and stable flow of oil, and/or the strategic </p><p>placement of troops in the region.  According to Dr. </p><p>al-Shatti, "the most important reason" for U.S. engagement </p><p>during the Gulf War was oil, followed by the establishment of </p><p>a U.S. presence in the region.  Prior to the crisis, he said </p><p>the U.S. had unsuccessfully attempted to conclude bilateral </p><p>military agreements with Kuwait.  The placement of U.S. </p><p>troops here during and after the Gulf War was a U.S. fait </p><p>accompli.  He acknowledged that, to a point, Kuwait and the </p><p>U.S. have a shared interest in stability. </p><p> </p><p>A Necessary Evil </p><p>---------------- </p><p>5. (C) While all of the Islamists we spoke to acknowledged </p><p>the U.S. military presence in Kuwait as necessary to the </p><p>maintenance of Kuwait\'s security and independence, they also </p><p>expressed their uneasiness with it and mistrust of the U.S. </p><p>In particular, they share the notion so common in the Arab </p><p>world that the U.S. is somehow currently controlling the </p><p>wealth of the region, and intends to expand this control to </p><p>include Iraq.  Al-Yaseen referred to the U.S. presence as </p><p>part of a historical pattern whereby the strong dominate the </p><p>weak and "steal their wealth."  Even when challenged with the </p><p>fact that Kuwait has always been paid for its oil, he </p><p>asserted a U.S. intent to control the world by making the </p><p>world dependent upon it for the maintenance of the flow of </p><p>oil.  Al-Shatti echoed Yaseen\'s concerns, adding (falsely, on </p><p>no evidence whatsoever) that the U.S. was behind the </p><p>exclusion of Kuwait from a recent Turkish-sponsored </p><p>conference on Iraq.  He said he thought U.S. interest in the </p><p>region would fade in fifty years, and worried that Kuwait </p><p>would be left with a tarnished reputation for swimming </p><p>against the powerful current of Arab anger towards the U.S. </p><p>"We are part of the Arab nation," he said, "and we don\'t want </p><p>to show that we are the black sheep." </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Kuwaiti Islamists are divided over Iraq: some, </p><p>including prominent Salafi Khalid Sultan al-Issa, support the </p><p>elimintaion of Saddam\'s regime by any means, including </p><p>invasion by infidels (us), but what we hear most often is </p><p>"get rid of him without war and without hurting the Iraqi </p><p>people." </p><p> </p><p>Conflict of Values </p><p>------------------ </p><p>7. (C) The Kuwaiti Islamists we spoke to decried U.S. </p><p>"interference" in the values of the Islamic World.  Every </p><p>Islamist we talk to takes it for granted (wrongly) that U.S. </p><p>Embassy Kuwait is responsible for curriculum reforms proposed </p><p>recently by Kuwait\'s Ministry of Education.  (Comment: This </p><p>is an irresistable way to for them to impugn the proposed </p><p>reforms as unpatriotic and contrary to Islam.  End Comment.) </p><p> Al-Shatti claimed the U.S. was "trying to convert Kuwait" </p><p>towards adopting a more Western value system, but cautioned </p><p>that this would not work because the two cultures were </p><p>founded upon the distinct and separate value systems of </p><p>Christianity and Islam, which "should be respected." </p><p> </p><p>--Individual Rights vs. Collective Rights - </p><p>Al-Shatti said that people in the West value the individual </p><p>above all else, and this leads to the dissoluton of families. </p><p>Ignoring the persistent practice of polygamy in Kuwait and </p><p>the Gulf region, he said that over 40% of families in the </p><p>U.S. are "irregular" because of this (Al-Shatti\'s definition </p><p>of a regular family is a nuclear family, i.e father, mother, </p><p>and children). </p><p> </p><p>-- Social Ties vs. Rituals ) Al-Shatti claimed the West has </p><p>forsaken the social ties of the community in favor of social </p><p>rituals such as baptism and marriage, which do not promote </p><p>social cohesion nearly as much. </p><p> </p><p>-- Justice vs. Freedom ) Al-Shatti says the West values </p><p>Freedom over Justice, whereas the East values Justice over </p><p>Freedom. This, he said, is what explains the imbalance of </p><p>wealth in the U.S. and other Western countries. (Comment: </p><p>Al-Shatti was quick to point out he did not endorse </p><p>Socialism.  Of course, he did not cite any statistics to </p><p>buttress his argument.  End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Comment: Suspicion of USG motives as the sole </p><p>superpower is hardly limited to this region, and U.S. support </p><p>for Israel rankles many Arabs and Muslims.  That said, Kuwait </p><p>is the one Arab country whose experience of us provides the </p><p>most positive reality-check on these suspicions.  It is </p><p>sobering to realize how little credit our track record gets </p><p>us even here, at least with an important segment of society. </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
