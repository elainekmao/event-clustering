<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ACCRA 000592 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR PRM, GENEVA FOR RMA, ROME FOR DHS, ABIDJAN AND </p><p>NAIROBI FOR REFCOORDS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/25/2013 </p><p>TAGS: GH, PREF, refugees </p><p>SUBJECT: ACCRA CANADIAN REP VOICES INTEREST IN TAKING </p><p>DENIED REFUGEES FOR ADMISSIONS </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Refugee Coordinator Carla T. Nadeau for Reasons 1.5 (b) </p><p>and (d) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  This is an action request, see paragraph 5. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  Summary: Regional Refugee Coordinator (Refcoord) for </p><p>Admissions, Carla Nadeau met with Canadian High Commission </p><p>Immigration Officer Elizabeth Snow to discuss refugee </p><p>admissions issues in West Africa. Snow voiced interest in </p><p>reviewing Refugee Access Verification Unit (RAVU) revoked </p><p>and/or denied U.S. Refugee Program (USRP) priority three </p><p>(P-3) cases.  Upon review, the Canadians would consider some </p><p>for eventual admission to the Canadian refugee program. </p><p>Asked whether the possibility existed to share information on </p><p>the reason for revocation/denial, Snow stated fraudulent </p><p>relationships would not necessarily rule applicants out. </p><p>Refcoord promised to convey request to Washington.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  Refcoord paid a courtesy call on Elizabeth Snow of </p><p>the Canadian High Commission to discuss refugee issues in </p><p>West Africa.  Following background discussion, Snow explained </p><p>that due to heavy domestic political pressure, she had been </p><p>given a message to quote shake the trees unquote to find more </p><p>numbers for the refugee resettlement program in Canada.  With </p><p>a world wide ceiling of 7,300 of which 400 are slated for W. </p><p>African admissions, Canada expects at the current rate to </p><p>come up quite short for the admissions year which ends in </p><p>December.  Commiserating that UNHCR Priority one (P-1) </p><p>referrals were slow in coming, Snow asked whether the USG </p><p>would be interested in sharing information on RAVU </p><p>revoked/denied P-3 cases.  Not promising large scale </p><p>resettlement, Snow opined that after reviewing a sampling of </p><p>cases and disregarding relationship fraud, as opposed to </p><p>direct misrepresentation, the Canadians could possibly </p><p>resettle some 1,000 of the USRP\'s W. African P-3 caseload. </p><p>Refcoord promised Snow that her proposal would be conveyed to </p><p>the appropriate figures in the USG. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Comment: It appears that the U.S. is not the only </p><p>country experiencing domestic political pressure to increase </p><p>refugee arrivals.  At first glance, sharing case file </p><p>information under current MOU\'s with Canada with the aim of </p><p>eventually resettling this caseload may be a good opportunity </p><p>to burden-share with our neighbor.  However, given that this </p><p>P-3 caseload in W. Africa is anchor-based, albeit often </p><p>fraudulently so, the USG may eventually have to contend with </p><p>the effects of secondary migration. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Action Request: Post requests Department guidance on </p><p>the Canadian proposal to share information on RAVU </p><p>denied/revoked P-3 cases for possible resettlement in Canada. </p><p>YATES </p><p></p></div>
