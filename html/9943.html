<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 05 ABUJA 001339 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PLEASE PASS TO ALL AFRICA POST </p><p>LAGOS FOR ADMIN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAID, ECON, PREL, SOCI, EINV, XA, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: THE ABUJA SULLIVAN SUMMIT WAS A SUCCESS </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary:  The Sixth Leon H. Sullivan Summit, </p><p>convened July 12-17 in Abuja was momentous and </p><p>successful.  The overarching Summit theme was "Africa: </p><p>A Continent of Possibilities" and the week lived up to </p><p>its name.  President Bush, the first Republican </p><p>President to visit Africa, made a historic address to </p><p>open the Summit.  Hosted by Nigerian President </p><p>Obasanjo the Summit was attended by approximately 15 </p><p>African Heads of State, important private sector </p><p>figures and representatives from NGOs and academia who </p><p>came to the event to strengthen the relationships </p><p>between Africans and Americans in the key areas of </p><p>business, trade and investment, education, health and </p><p>agriculture.  The late Rev. Sullivan\'s legacy of self- </p><p>help and bridge-building across the Atlantic was </p><p>affirmed by the Summiteers, including President George </p><p>Bush in his opening remarks.  In addition to Secretary </p><p>Powell, National Security Advisor Rice and White House </p><p>Chief of Staff Card who were part of the President\'s </p><p>delegation, the Summit was well attended by senior USG </p><p>officials, representing the U.S. Agency for </p><p>International Development (USAID), the U.S. Trade </p><p>Representative (USTR), the Department of </p><p>Transportation (DOT), and the Department of Energy </p><p>(DOE).  Ambassador Jeter hosted a welcome reception </p><p>for the Summit delegation.  End Summary). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>THE SETTING: QUITE AN ASSEMBLAGE </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  The Sixth Sullivan Summit gathered together an </p><p>expressive roster of government and private sector </p><p>personalities and talent from both sides of the </p><p>Atlantic.  Thirty-one African countries were </p><p>represented by Heads of State or other senior </p><p>government officials including President Obasanjo, </p><p>Senegal President Wade, Mozambique Chissano (current </p><p>African Union Chairman), President Kerekou of Benin, </p><p>Namibian Prime Minister Gurirab, Burkinabe President </p><p>Compaore, President Kufuor of Ghana, Gambian President </p><p>Jammeh, President de Menezes of Sao Tome and Principe, </p><p>President Mkapa of Tanzania, President Nguema of </p><p>Equatorial Guinea, Togo\'s Eyadema, and even embattled </p><p>President Mugabe of Zimbabwe attended the event </p><p>(probably in an attempt to lessen his growing </p><p>political isolation). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  In addition to paying tribute to Rev. Sullivan, </p><p>the African leaders energetically discussed the </p><p>panoply of development challenges facing their </p><p>countries and their continent.  American and Nigerian </p><p>corporate leaders were represented in significant </p><p>numbers, described their interventions in support of </p><p>development in Africa, and made commitments to </p><p>continue their efforts, including to help prevent the </p><p>spread of HIV/AIDS and other preventable diseases, </p><p>increase the use of information technology, and </p><p>improve food security.  A bit of Hollywood luster was </p><p>added by the attendance of actors Chris Tucker (Rush </p><p>Hour) and Joseph Phillips (The Cosby Show). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  The more than 600 delegates participated in </p><p>plenary sessions and workshops that produced </p><p>actionable recommendations building on agreements from </p><p>earlier Summits and other global fora. </p><p>Recommendations in the thematic areas of agriculture, </p><p>health, education, and energy, trade and investment </p><p>are intended to expand public-private partnerships to </p><p>produce healthier and more educated populations in </p><p>Africa, increase cooperation between Africa and the </p><p>United States, and enhance Africa\'s position in the </p><p>global economy.   The Summit recommendations will be </p><p>issued as a Summit Action Resolution and cited on the </p><p>Summit website at www.thesummit.org. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>PRESIDENT BUSH: OPENS THE SUMMIT/SETS THE PACE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  In a historic first for the Summit, the sitting </p><p>President of the United States opened the affair. </p><p>President Bush eulogized Rev. Sullivan and reaffirmed </p><p>key components of our Africa policy - the Millennium </p><p>Challenge Account (MCA), the PMTCT, the Emergency AIDS </p><p>Initiative, and anti-terrorism.  He also announced a </p><p>grant of $5 million dollars to one of Rev. Sullivan\'s </p><p>organizations, the International Foundation for </p><p>Education and Self Help (IFESH) to support teacher </p><p>training.  President Bush was accompanied by Mrs. </p><p>Bush, Secretary of State Colin Powell, National </p><p>Security Advisor Condoleeza Rice, and White House </p><p>Chief of Staff Andrew Card.  Other senior officials of </p><p>the Bush Administration were also in attendance, </p><p>including Assistant Secretary of State for African </p><p>Affairs, Walter Kansteiner, Senior Advisor on Africa </p><p>to the President Jendayi Frazer, Assistant </p><p>Administrator, Bureau for Africa at USAID Constance </p><p>Berry Newman and Assistant Administrator, Bureau for </p><p>Global Health at USAID Anne Peterson. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  Before President Bush\'s address, President </p><p>Obasanjo delivered brief remarks welcoming the </p><p>delegates to Abuja and acknowledging the great </p><p>contributions Reverend Sullivan had made strengthening </p><p>the relationship between Africa and America.  Hope </p><p>Sullivan, President and CEO of the Sullivan </p><p>Foundation, acknowledged the many American and </p><p>Nigerian corporate sponsors of the Summit, including </p><p>Chevron Texaco, Exxon Mobil, Shell, Archer Daniels </p><p>Midland, Chrome Energy Corp., Coca Cola, Sea, </p><p>Petroleum and Gas, World Airways, SunTrust Oil, and </p><p>USAID. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  On July 14, Ambassador Andrew Young, Summit </p><p>Chairman and Chairman of the Sullivan Foundation and </p><p>Nigerian Vice President Atiku Abubakar addressed the </p><p>opening plenary session.  Young stated that Africa is </p><p>the missing cog in the world economy.  He stressed </p><p>that realization of Rev. Sullivan\'s dream of building </p><p>a bridge between Africa and America would promote </p><p>mutual development that will make use of the </p><p>heretofore untapped resources and wealth on the </p><p>African continent.  After welcoming the delegates to </p><p>the "emerging city of Abuja," Vice President Abubakar </p><p>stated that democracy will endure in Nigeria and that </p><p>the Obasanjo administration will pursue new </p><p>investments, infrastructure enhancement, capital </p><p>growth, and enabling environment.  He further stated </p><p>that Nigeria is removing barriers to investment, </p><p>banking practices are being liberalized, severe anti- </p><p>corruption laws are being implemented and a level </p><p>economic playing field is being created. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  The Summit theme, "Africa: A Continent of </p><p>Possibilities" was explored through the lens of four </p><p>themes: 1) Agriculture, 2) Health, 3) Education, and </p><p>4) Energy, Trade and Investment.  Summit organizers </p><p>emphasized that each theme is integral to sustainable </p><p>development and economic growth and urged delegates to </p><p>make forward-looking and pragmatic recommendations </p><p>that will have practical application. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>AGRICULTURE: MAKING FOOD MORE PLENTIFUL </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  Discussion of agriculture, held on July 14, </p><p>consisted of a plenary and three break-out sessions. </p><p>Plenary speakers were Dr. Walter Hill, Tuskegee </p><p>University, Nigerian Agriculture Minister Bello, Ms. </p><p>Eva Clayton, FAO and South African Agricultural </p><p>Minister Didiza.  Break-out sessions focussed on </p><p>Biotechnology and its Impact on Food Security and </p><p>Sustainability in Sub-Saharan Africa; Reducing Hunger </p><p>in Africa; and Models of Successful Agribusiness </p><p>Development and Trade in Africa. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  Speakers in the plenary and break-out sessions </p><p>made significant points, including: a) poverty, </p><p>environmental degradation and malnutrition rob African </p><p>nations of vitality and the opportunity to develop </p><p>their people and resources; b) science and technology, </p><p>(currently constrained by low funding in most African </p><p>nations), improved application of best practices can </p><p>make a significant difference in tackling Africa\'s </p><p>chronic malnutrition and poverty; c) food security is </p><p>a paramount issue for the security of states; d) </p><p>agriculture is central to poverty reduction, but faces </p><p>the challenges of low increases in yield, low input, </p><p>and little value-added processing; e) women play a </p><p>critical role in agriculture in Africa; f) and NEPAD </p><p>is a concrete demonstration of African collective </p><p>political will to promote agriculture and economic </p><p>development in general. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  Agriculture recommendations included: a) science </p><p>and technology in agriculture (e.g., through research) </p><p>needs to be addressed by encouraging both private-and </p><p>public-sector investment; b) women\'s role in </p><p>agricultural production must be enhanced and </p><p>safeguarded; c) biotechnology must factor n an overall </p><p>strategy to promote agriculture growth and assure food </p><p>security; d) a strategy to expand the role of the </p><p>private sector and the potential of expanded use of </p><p>science and technology needs to be developed; and e) </p><p>Africa must create an environment that encourages </p><p>private-sector investment in small-scale farming. </p><p>More information on the Agriculture presentations and </p><p>recommendations will be available on the Summit </p><p>website at www.thesummit.org. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>HEALTH: LONGER, BETTER LIVES </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  The Health Plenary, held on July 14, featured Dr. </p><p>Anne Peterson, Assistant Administrator, Bureau for </p><p>Global Health, USAID, South African Health Minister </p><p>Tshabalala-Msimang, Professor Babatounde Osotimehin, </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Chairman, National Action Committee on AIDS, Nigeria, </p><p>Dr. Eamon Kelly, IFESH Board of Directors, and Jay </p><p>Pryor, Chevron Nigeria.   Break-out sessions were held </p><p>on these topics: Mobilizing the Needed Leadership in </p><p>the Fight Against HIV/AIDS; Rolling Back Malaria; </p><p>Nutrition and Food Security; and MEDHELP Foundation\'s </p><p>Open Heart Surgery. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13.  Plenary and break-out session speakers addressed </p><p>the nexus between health and development, </p><p>acknowledging the threat to sustainable development </p><p>caused by the prevalence of debilitating illnesses and </p><p>the general deterioration of national health </p><p>infrastructures, despite undoubted advances in some </p><p>areas.  They pointed to the many key determinants of </p><p>health and disease that lie outside the direct control </p><p>of the health sector: water and sanitation, education, </p><p>agriculture, employment, environment, trade, tourism, </p><p>energy, housing, security, as well as technology. </p><p>Speakers urged the use of affordable technologies to </p><p>assist HIV/AIDS prevention, care and support. </p><p>Peterson, in particular, aligned the need for adequate </p><p>investments in health with national policies on </p><p>poverty reduction.  Speakers called for stable and </p><p>high-quality assistance and public-private </p><p>partnerships to combat poverty, HIV/AIDS, food </p><p>insecurity, gender inequalities, other priority </p><p>development issues, and to move Africa toward the </p><p>millennium development goals (MDGs). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14.  Health recommendations were made in each break- </p><p>out session and they include:  a) African governments </p><p>should create enabling environments for stakeholders </p><p>to meet key national, regional and international </p><p>health goals (e.g. MDGs and the Abuja Declaration on </p><p>Fighting HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria);  b) </p><p>African and US governments, businesses and </p><p>international PVOs/NGOs; c) African and US governments </p><p>and development partners should ensure that model </p><p>multi-sector approaches to address health challenges </p><p>are implemented and assessed including what does not </p><p>work, in addressing African health problems; the </p><p>information should be widely shared using information </p><p>technology; e) All African development partners should </p><p>provide more support for research and scientifically </p><p>tested utilization of African traditional medicine, </p><p>keeping in mind the need for local patent protection </p><p>of any medicines  produced; and g) The Sullivan Summit </p><p>should use its web site to highlight innovative </p><p>partnerships that effectively address HIV/AIDS and </p><p>other African health challenges.  More information on </p><p>the health presentations and recommendations will be </p><p>available on the Summit website at www.thesummit.org. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>EDUCATION: THE NEED TO KEEP PACE </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15.  Education sessions were held July 15.  Dr. </p><p>Frederick Humphries, President and CEO, National </p><p>Association for Equal Opportunity in Higher Education </p><p>(NAFEO) chaired the plenary panel of distinguished </p><p>speakers:  Mr. Julius Harvey, Vice President, Chevron </p><p>Texaco\'s West Africa Products; Mr. Noureini Tidjani- </p><p>Serpos, Assistant Director-General, Africa Department, </p><p>UNESCO, Paris; Honorable Constance Berry Newman, </p><p>Assistant Administrator, Bureau for Africa, USAID; and </p><p>Mr. Michael Omolewa, Permanent Representative of </p><p>Nigeria, UNESCO, Paris.  At the end of the plenary </p><p>session, Chevron Texaco committed $5 million to the </p><p>Sullivan Foundation for the Books for Africa Program. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16.  Break-out session topics were: Institutionalized </p><p>Development Collaboration Between Historically Black </p><p>Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and African Colleges </p><p>and Universities; Prioritizing Universal Primary </p><p>Education and Gender Equality; Utilizing Information </p><p>Technology and the Training of Trainers in </p><p>Strengthening Basic Education; and the Role of the </p><p>Private Sector and NGOs in Capacity Building. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>17.  Plenary and Break-out speakers identified </p><p>challenges and trends that warrant further </p><p>consideration for educational development in Africa </p><p>and examined potential strategic US/Africa </p><p>partnerships, with an emphasis on women and children. </p><p>Many substantive points were made, including the </p><p>following summary items: a) despite improvements </p><p>within the past decade, inadequate access and quality, </p><p>particularly for girls continue to hinder education in </p><p>Africa; b) Africa has the lowest school enrollment </p><p>rates in the world, with a corollary of low literacy </p><p>rates; c) equal access to education is key in </p><p>eradicating gender inequality; d) education is a </p><p>precursor to an increasingly skilled workforce, a </p><p>strong civil society, and economic growth; e) many </p><p>African countries will not achieve Education for All </p><p>goals by the 2015 target; f) holistic education in </p><p>indigenous learning contexts is important along with </p><p>the need to educate communities of people; and, g) </p><p>various commitments by donors and the private sector </p><p>can assist Africa to achieve qualitative education for </p><p>all: the U.S. Presidential initiative, the African </p><p>Education Initiative (AEI), UNESCO\'s efforts to </p><p>eradicate gender inequality, and Shell\'s scholarships </p><p>to students. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>18.  Education recommendations included: 1) African </p><p>countries need to commit more resources to education; </p><p>2) the NEPAD Secretariat should develop an education </p><p>action plan, addressing advocacy, measuring success, </p><p>teacher training, support counseling, and production </p><p>of resource materials; 3) HBCUs should establish </p><p>linkages with African and Caribbean universities, </p><p>particularly through a network of international </p><p>virtual universities that will employ technology </p><p>transfer, teacher training, etc.; 4) address gender </p><p>inequalities through aggressive campaigns; and, 5) </p><p>Summit and international organizations should  post </p><p>and adopt best practices in capacity building at the </p><p>community level.  More information about the Education </p><p>presentations and recommendations will be posted on </p><p>the Summit website at www.thesummit.org. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>ENERGY, TRADE AND INVESTMENT-PATHS TO GROWTH </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>19.  The Energy, Trade and Investment sessions were </p><p>held July 16.  George Kirkland, President </p><p>ChevronTexaco Overseas Petroleum (USA) served as the </p><p>chair and gave the keynote address.  Other speakers </p><p>included: Vice President Abubakar; Dr. Rilmanu Lukman, </p><p>Special Adviser to Nigerian President Obasanjo on </p><p>Petroleum; Congressman William Jefferson; Mr. Kofi </p><p>Appenteng, Chairman Board of Directors, African- </p><p>American Institute (USA); Wiseman Nkuhlu, Steering </p><p>Committee Chairperson, NEPAD (South Africa).  Break- </p><p>out sessions were held on the following topics:  Trade </p><p>and AGOA; Energy-Potential and Possibilities; and The </p><p>Potential of Investment Opportunities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>20.  Vice President Abubakar pointed to tremendous </p><p>investment opportunities not only in Nigeria\'s energy </p><p>sector but in agriculture, solid minerals, cement, </p><p>fertilizer and tourism.  He announced that the GON </p><p>will privatize industries in the energy sector and has </p><p>started this process by unbundling for the mammoth </p><p>state-owned electric company, NEPA.  Atiku applauded </p><p>the United States\' AGOA partnership with Africa and </p><p>welcomed the extension of the Act by the Bush </p><p>Administration; he said Nigeria\'s textile industry was </p><p>well positioned to take advantage of AGOA.  He </p><p>recommended that United States companies should invest </p><p>more in Nigeria\'s energy sector, especially in the </p><p>natural gas sector and that United States </p><p>entrepreneurs should invest in and develop non-oil </p><p>sectors such as agriculture, petrochemicals, solid </p><p>minerals and tourism. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>21.  The main points and recommendations that emerged </p><p>from the Energy, Trade and Investment sessions </p><p>included the following: </p><p>-- a) Speakers acknowledged that Nigeria will be at </p><p>the forefront of deepwater oil and gas extraction over </p><p>the next ten years, that Nigeria\'s local and regional </p><p>gas markets have yet to be tapped, and oil development </p><p>will remain strong for the foreseeable future; </p><p>-- b) Nigerians must take advantage of the transfer of </p><p>explorative and extractive technologies; </p><p>-- c) Nigeria must develop its local gas market </p><p>through investor incentives; </p><p>-- d) The Gulf of Guinea will likely supply the United </p><p>States with 25% of its crude oil by 2010, therefore, </p><p>the region must make the country\'s bidding process and </p><p>regulations more transparent and predictable; </p><p>-- e) Nigeria should encourage investment in coal, </p><p>uranium and gas sectors. </p><p>-- f) Nigeria should stoke investment in non-oil </p><p>industries, such as agriculture and mineral resources, </p><p>by offering investors tax and import incentive in </p><p>order to create more wealth and stability in the </p><p>country; </p><p>-- g) The GON must pass the required legislation to </p><p>become AGOA eligible; </p><p>-- h) The GON should provide concession incentives to </p><p>gas, petrochemical and fertilizer companies to </p><p>encourage development; </p><p>-- i) Nigerian businessmen should use OPIC, the </p><p>Export-Import Bank and the U.S. Trade and Development </p><p>Authority to a greater extent for greater access to </p><p>much needed investment insurance, capital and training </p><p>opportunities; </p><p>-- j) the United States should name Nigeria an area of </p><p>vital strategic importance; </p><p>-- k) African American and Nigerian businessmen should </p><p>forge closer business links through the Black Caucus </p><p>Foundation, the Sullivan Foundation or other </p><p>organizations that promote African interests; and </p><p>-- l) Western donors should contribute to NEPAD and </p><p>partner with Africa countries as part of an </p><p>overarching program to bring prosperity and peace to </p><p>Africa. </p><p>More information about the Energy, Trade and </p><p>Investment presentations and recommendations will be </p><p>available on the Summit website at www.thesummit.org. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL PLENARY </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>22.  The Presidential Plenary was held on July 16. </p><p>Led by President Obasanjo of Nigeria, the African </p><p>Presidents expressed hope that the Summit would lead </p><p>to greater corporate investment in Africa.  President </p><p>Kerekou of Benin emphasized the cultural ties between </p><p>Africa and the U.S., the need for more cooperation </p><p>between HBCUs and African Universities, and praised </p><p>AGOA as a way of increasing trade and NEPAD as a </p><p>framework for effective action.  President Wade also </p><p>held up the vision of  NEPAD as one of good governance </p><p>and involvement of the private sector.  He stated </p><p>that, a plan created by African decision-makers has a </p><p>better chance of being implemented than one prepared </p><p>by a technical expert.  Citing that the private sector </p><p>developed the U.S. Europe and Japan, he said it can </p><p>also develop Africa.  Having hosted the Summit of 1997 </p><p>in Zimbabwe, President Mugabe paid tribute to Rev. </p><p>Sullivan and stressed the need for NEPAD.  However, </p><p>his message, although in support of a good cause, also </p><p>came with a touch of malice.  He asked the Summiteers </p><p>to support NEPAD in order to "help Africans become </p><p>ourselves.  Help us not to be puppets." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>23.  The coup in Sao Tome added unexpected drama to </p><p>the Presidential Plenary.  Timing the coup with </p><p>President de Menezes\' absence may have been convenient </p><p>for the putschists to achieve their takeover; however, </p><p>it was terrible timing as far as the diplomatic public </p><p>backlash to their action.  Not only did the Summit </p><p>produce a convenient venue for the Heads of State to </p><p>privately confer about the coup, each Head of State </p><p>that ascended the rostrum condemned this arrogation, </p><p>sending a clear message that coups were no longer </p><p>acceptable practice in Africa.  When President de </p><p>Menezes rose to speak, the audience erupted in </p><p>applause and gave him a standing ovation.  He stated </p><p>that, although already in Abuja, he decided not to </p><p>attend the Summit after the coup was staged.  However, </p><p>President Obasanjo persuaded him to attend the Summit </p><p>to demonstrate that he was not cowed and to make a </p><p>strong public appeal against this undemocratic action. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>23.  Other African leaders spoke at the ceremonial </p><p>Final Funeral Rites of Rev. Leon Sullivan held on July </p><p>17.  The ceremony was steeped in tradition as numerous </p><p>traditional funeral dances were performed.  It was a </p><p>very touching and moving occasion. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LIBERI </p><p></p></div>
