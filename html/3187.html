<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 05 ABUJA 001850 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>RIYADH FOR POL - R. HANKS </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O.12958: DECL: 06/14/12 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, SOCI, KDEM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: A RETURN TO REGIONAL ELECTORAL POLITICS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) ABUJA 852 B) ABUJA 1068 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY CHARGE TIM ANDREWS. REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: A current snapshot of presidential </p><p>electioneering shows two contesting strategies, one devised </p><p>by the President\'s camp, the other by his strongest </p><p>opposition. The President appears content to steamroll the </p><p>PDP nomination through tightening his grip on the party </p><p>apparatus. To win the general election, his team will </p><p>exploit the powers of incumbency, cut as many "mutual </p><p>support pacts" with other incumbents as possible, and </p><p>attempt to keep the opposition fragmented. On the other side </p><p>of the battlements, the most serious opposition strategy </p><p>hearkens to the regionally-centered electoral calculus of </p><p>the past. Powerbrokers are huddling to recreate the </p><p>Northwest-Southeast axis that formed the winning </p><p>presidential ticket in every election save 1993 and 1999. </p><p>However, selecting a ticket palatable to most key opposition </p><p>players will be difficult. Another possible twist is whether </p><p>the presidential candidate will be from the Southeast </p><p>(Igbo), with the running mate from the Northwest. Both </p><p>inherently cynical and overtly power-driven, these </p><p>strategies discount the average voter and eschew substantive </p><p>issues. In doing so, they throttle genuine democratization </p><p>and may exacerbate disillusionment among large segments of </p><p>public. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>A HISTORIC CHANCE BEING SPENT </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The 1999 election was as much a referendum against </p><p>continued military rule as it was a vote for Obasanjo. </p><p>Handed the blank canvas of this negative mandate, Obasanjo </p><p>came to office with high hopes on the public\'s part that he </p><p>could paint a picture of a more democratic, productive </p><p>Nigeria. However, he has failed to develop a positive </p><p>mandate, and his supporters increasingly cast the next </p><p>elections in negative terms also: Don\'t let the bad guys </p><p>come back. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Reftel A mentioned that Obasanjo needed to devote </p><p>more attention to taking care of domestic policy imperatives </p><p>and mending political fences. This meant fewer journeys </p><p>abroad and more consultations at home. He apparently did not </p><p>read our cable. In June alone, he will take four </p><p>international trips, some of them with multiple </p><p>destinations. We have not heard reports of him saying </p><p>"sorry" to any of the political figures on whose toes he has </p><p>stepped during the past three years. His popularity </p><p>continues to flag. Recently a group of National Assembly </p><p>members from Obasanjo\'s PDP wrote party chairmen Ogbeh </p><p>threatening to bolt from the party if Obasanjo won the party </p><p>nomination. Ogbeh has reportedly told the President that 15 </p><p>of the 21 PDP governors would prefer a different </p><p>Presidential nominee (This would be a blow to Obasanjo\'s </p><p>strategy. It also may be a reason that the Presidency </p><p>appears to be rethinking the utility of the deal Obasanjo </p><p>cut with the Governors to hold local government elections in </p><p>August.). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Obasanjo has even managed to fall out with Senate </p><p>President Anyim, previously considered one of the most loyal </p><p>tools in the presidential shed. Anyim has tacitly supported </p><p>the recent impeachment motion against Obasanjo in the </p><p>Senate. While the motion will likely exhaust itself, the </p><p>estrangement of Anyim demonstrates Obasanjo has not lose his </p><p>penchant for turning friends into enemies. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) People acknowledge that he works hard but they </p><p>question his sincerity, priorities and effectiveness. For </p><p>many people, he gives the impression of a man feverishly </p><p>running in place when he is not running in a circle. Because </p><p>he is guilty of angering the high and disenchanting the </p><p>humble, he does not have much goodwill. For an incumbent </p><p>whose administration has not lived up to expectation, this </p><p>is a severe vulnerability. If he had retained sufficient </p><p>goodwill, it would be easy for people to excuse him by </p><p>reasoning that the job is very tough or that Obasanjo was </p><p>doing his best but has been ill served by his advisors. </p><p>Right now, most people see the federal government as an </p><p>extension of Obasanjo\'s personality and view its failures as </p><p>reflecting his own shortcomings. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Outwardly, President Obasanjo seems oblivious to the </p><p>political discontent around him. Part of the reason may be </p><p>that his haughty character disallows much consideration of </p><p>what lesser humans think of him. Another reason is that, in </p><p>his political calculations, public opinion may not matter </p><p>all that much. An American political consultant would advise </p><p>Obasanjo that he needed to go out and win the people\'s minds </p><p>if not hearts. Yet, Obasanjo does not seem primed to reach </p><p>out and touch. The time is quickly dwindling for such a move </p><p>to be effective. Soon, the intended audience would view any </p><p>such overture as a last minute attempt to curry favor after </p><p>over three years of indifference. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) To his critics, Obasanjo has behaved like an autocrat </p><p>wearing democratic garments.  What can be gleaned of his </p><p>campaign strategy at this stage tends to confirm the </p><p>characterization. The first rung of the game plan apparently </p><p>is to suppress serious internal challenge to Obasanjo\'s </p><p>renomination.  This was the rationale behind the April </p><p>pilgrimage to Obasanjo\'s farm in Ota by PDP stalwarts to </p><p>"beg" the President to seek another term. That procession </p><p>was engineered by Works Minister Tony Anenih, Nigeria\'s </p><p>archetypal backroom politician. According to most observers, </p><p>Anenih has not seen a deal he could not cut nor run across a </p><p>principle he would not disavow if the price were right. </p><p>Anenih, now second in command of the reelection campaign </p><p>behind absentee Finance Minister Adamu Ciroma, is not above </p><p>brandishing threats as well. According to one Northern </p><p>governor, Anenih told PDP governors that they could expect </p><p>plums from the Presidency for their personal consumption if </p><p>they came out in support of Obasanjo. However, if they </p><p>failed, they could expect much harsher tidings. In an ironic </p><p>twist, the amoral Minister threatened state executives with </p><p>being called before the anti-corruption panel. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) To help entice governors and other elected officials </p><p>to support Obasanjo, the team wants to cut informal mutual </p><p>support agreements with as many incumbents as possible. This </p><p>tack seems to transcend party lines as the Obasanjo team has </p><p>apparently wooed a few AD governors and maybe one or two APP </p><p>state executives. Through these arrangements, the team hopes </p><p>to use the interests of state and local candidates to </p><p>campaign energetically on their own behalf at the grassroots </p><p>level to Obasanjo\'s advantage. Thus far, this is the closest </p><p>Obasanjo\'s strategy comes to reaching out to the electorate, </p><p>but it is essentially by proxy. While indirect rule was the </p><p>political system in colonial Nigeria, Obasanjo might just </p><p>add the term "indirect campaigning" to the national lexicon. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) The third leg of his strategy is to fragment the </p><p>opposition. Knowing that the toughest opposition is lodged </p><p>in the North, Anenih has tried to coax a few older Northern </p><p>politicians into the Obasanjo camp. The Obasanjo team has </p><p>also tried to thwart Igbo solidarity. Senior-level Igbos in </p><p>the Administration have tried to drive a wedge through Igbo </p><p>land by discouraging talk of an Igbo presidency in 2003. </p><p>Additionally, the President\'s team has welcomed the likes of </p><p>the odious Senator Arthur Nzeribe who left the APP for the </p><p>PDP. The rich and essentially selfish Nzeribe will back any </p><p>government in power, as long as the price is right. He has </p><p>publicly backed Obasanjo and will likely use his resources </p><p>to pull other Igbos toward Obasanjo. Last, Obasanjo critics </p><p>contend the Presidency, having lost the fight to restrict </p><p>this electoral cycle to the PDP, AD and APP, will now </p><p>pressure the Independent National Electoral Commission </p><p>(INEC) to register 5-10 new political parties. According to </p><p>this theory, his team wants numerous opposition parties to </p><p>prevent the President\'s foes from assembling under one roof. </p><p>The President\'s supporters reportedly paid some senior UNDP </p><p>and APP figures to scuttle the two parties\' planned merger. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>A COUNTER STRATEGY </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Obasanjo\'s failure to develop an electoral </p><p>constituency and to present a compelling vision for the </p><p>future has both afflicted and helped his opponents. Because </p><p>his cupboard is relatively bare, they have little need to </p><p>fill theirs. Obasanjo\'s inability has made it easy for his </p><p>detractors to sally backward and find their solutions in the </p><p>politics of the past. His enemies have embraced the tried </p><p>and tested strategy of forging an alliance of two of the </p><p>three politically strategic regions, namely the North and </p><p>the Southeast.  Here, the North serves as a proxy for the </p><p>Northwest, traditionally the politically potent part of the </p><p>region. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. Aside: Because of the importance affluence, status and </p><p>age play in Nigerian politics, most of the key players are </p><p>rich older men relatively conservative in outlook. </p><p>Unsurprisingly, many would find succor in the politics of </p><p>old rather than in diving into the uncertainly of a more </p><p>egalitarian set-up. In a different way, Obasanjo also is </p><p>guilty of superimposing the past on the present. Instead of </p><p>being the consensus-building democrat people craved, </p><p>Obasanjo has copied too liberally from how he ruled during </p><p>the late seventies. What was appropriate then is passe now. </p><p>Hailed as an enlightened military ruler years ago, he now is </p><p>criticized by many as a quasi-autocrat with only superficial </p><p>democratic attributes. End Aside. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>ENEMIES TO THE NORTH OF HIM </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) The North is where opposition runs deepest. Northern </p><p>elites feel shortchanged under Obasanjo and fear their </p><p>influence in national politics may be irretrievably lost </p><p>should Obasanjo win another four years. Strategy-minded </p><p>Northerners point out that the combination of Obasanjo- </p><p>Atiku, representing the Southwest and the Northeast, </p><p>respectively, is the antithesis of the regional axis that </p><p>controlled national politics previously. In that Obasanjo </p><p>has registered a lackluster performance and has allegedly </p><p>betrayed their support by ignoring their interests, these </p><p>Northerners see no reason not to revive the old political </p><p>combine. Theirs is essentially a two-step strategy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) First, they seek to coalesce Northern opinion. The </p><p>vehicle for this endeavor is the Arewa Consultative Forum. </p><p>The ACF is not yet united, however, as the rejection by many </p><p>of Sokoto Governor Bafarawa\'s April speech to the ACF shows. </p><p>But most Northerners do not reject Bafarawa\'s sharply anti- </p><p>Obasanjo sentiment. The few Northerners who believe that the </p><p>President should be re-elected (usually saying he is the </p><p>least-bad person for the job) are coming under increasing </p><p>pressure to keep their views to themselves.  After tepidly </p><p>endorsing Obasanjo earlier this year, Kaduna governor Ahmed </p><p>Makarfi has been under heavy pressure to recant. Once seen </p><p>as almost a shoe-in for reelection, Makarfi now faces strong </p><p>opposition that has the support of key ACF leaders.  A </p><p>senior Northern politician claimed Makarfi and VP Atiku </p><p>Abubakar were essentially run out of Kafanchan, in southern </p><p>Kaduna State, during a recent campaign swing and that they </p><p>were politely ignored by most people in Makarfi, the </p><p>governor\'s home LGA. We cannot confirm this assertion. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) The second element of this plan is to reach out to </p><p>the Southeast and as an alternative, the South-South. (The </p><p>ethnic and political heterogeneity of the South-South makes </p><p>that region a less cohesive bloc and thus a much less </p><p>attractive partner.) Former Commonwealth Secretary General </p><p>Emeka Anyaoku recently told us a delegation of northerners, </p><p>including Sokoto\'s Bafarawa, visited him last year. They </p><p>proposed a Northwest-Southeast alliance with him as the </p><p>Presidential candidate. The gentlemanly Anyaoku declined the </p><p>offer, saying that he had no appetite for the hurly-burly of </p><p>Nigerian politics. However, there are more ambitious Igbo </p><p>politicians waiting to chomp on that hook, most notably </p><p>Shehu Shagari\'s Vice President, Alex Ekwueme. Ekwueme was to </p><p>have succeeded Shagari in 1987, but his dream died when </p><p>Muhammadu Buhari and Tunde Idiagbon seized power. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>ENEMIES TO THE SOUTHEAST OF HIM </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15. (C) The call for an Igbo president has matured from a </p><p>relative murmur to a loud clamor. The lead social-cultural </p><p>organization Ohaneze Ndigbo and other pan-Igbo groups have </p><p>met. While the groups have not issued official statements, </p><p>most leading members of the organizations have publicly </p><p>endorsed the call. Miscalculations by President Obasanjo and </p><p>Igbos in his administration unwittingly have fed the fire. </p><p>Early on, Transportation Minister Maduekwe had his eyes on </p><p>the governor\'s seat in Abia State. Other Igbos in the </p><p>Presidency wanted to undermine the growing popularity of </p><p>Abia Governor Kalu to prevent his draw at home from </p><p>eclipsing theirs. To combat this attack, which he felt had </p><p>the Obasanjo seal of approval, Kalu sounded the clarion for </p><p>an Igbo president. It was a masterstroke. By appealing to </p><p>the yearning of the Igbo, who feel they have not be fully </p><p>integrated into the political arena since the civil war, </p><p>Kalu made himself the unofficial spokesperson for the entire </p><p>tribe. This increased his popularity and made his detractors </p><p>seem to be ethnic traitors. An attack on Kalu was perceived </p><p>as an attack against the Igbo in general. Others began to </p><p>pick up the call for the presidency to come to the </p><p>Southeast. Now it has a life of its own, right at the heart </p><p>of political discussion in the Southeast. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>WILL THE OPPOSITION TWAIN MEET? </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16. (C) While aversion to Obasanjo is strong in both the </p><p>Northwest (and indeed most of the vast and populous former </p><p>Northern Region) and Southeast, striking a deal will be </p><p>difficult and will require many more late night negotiating </p><p>sessions. The Igbos know they will have to deal with the </p><p>North. However, they do not want to be the junior partner </p><p>once again. The Igbos want the lead this time. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16. (C) The wisest and most experienced Northern elders </p><p>(those no longer engaged in seeking political office) </p><p>believe that the North must not try to re-assume the </p><p>Presidency in 2003. They believe the best hope of sustaining </p><p>Northern influence until 2007 lies in supporting an older, </p><p>not too energetic Igbo (like Ekwueme) for President, with a </p><p>younger Northerner as VP-cum-power behind the throne). They </p><p>believe (probably correctly) that the Igbo will give 80-90% </p><p>of their votes nationwide to a co-ethnic. Fearing that </p><p>Obasanjo\'s supporters will try to rig elections, they view </p><p>the enormous internal Igbo diaspora as a natural army of </p><p>poll-watchers that will be able to keep the rigging to a </p><p>minimum. Ambitious Northerners who want the keys to Aso </p><p>Villa for themselves, however, ask why the old formula </p><p>(Shagari/Ekwueme (civil rule) and Babangida/Aikhomu </p><p>(military rule)) cannot serve as a tonic for the body </p><p>politic today. This debate will continue among Northern </p><p>actors for some time to come, but the trendline clearly </p><p>favors an Igbo lead. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>17. (C) To bolster their position in talks with the North, </p><p>Igbo leaders are trying to line up the South-South\'s </p><p>support.  However, getting the fractious South-South </p><p>politicians to agree on anything is difficult. Given </p><p>historical animosities that date back to the transatlantic </p><p>slave trade, getting South-South politicians to agree to </p><p>support an Igbo leader for national office is a Herculean </p><p>task.  The South-South has, during Nigeria\'s post-colonial </p><p>history, more often aligned with the North, specifically in </p><p>order to advance the one interest upon which its diverse </p><p>peoples seemingly can agree -- resisting domination by the </p><p>more numerous and far more cohesive Igbo.  For its part, the </p><p>North, in order to retain leverage, is also discussing a </p><p>South-South Presidency. Again, the possible candidates are </p><p>older, relatively non-controversial figures. Septuagenarian </p><p>Christian Onoh\'s name is one that surfaces occasionally. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>18. (C) The predominantly Lagos-based Nigerian media harp on </p><p>Northern domination of national politics.  But Northerners </p><p>have a different perspective.  While conceding that generals </p><p>and politicians from the North have disproportionately held </p><p>the top job since independence, they argue that the North </p><p>has tried since 1993 to engender greater balance.  The North </p><p>voted heavily for Abiola in 1993, they point out: Abiola </p><p>even won his Kano-based opponent\'s LGA. The North lined up </p><p>behind Obasanjo in 1999; even those opposed to Obasanjo and </p><p>the PDP backed a candidate from the Southwest, Olu Falae. In </p><p>return for their support of Obasanjo, they continue, their </p><p>interests have been ignored.  This was the essence of </p><p>Bafarawa\'s screed. Many Northerners fear an Igbo Southerner, </p><p>once in office, would treat them as shabbily as has the </p><p>incumbent Yoruba Southerner. For the Igbo to achieve their </p><p>symbol of complete political rehabilitation, they will have </p><p>to allay those Northern fears. For historical reasons, the </p><p>time is not yet ripe for rapprochement between the Southwest </p><p>and the Southeast. So, without the North, an Igbo Presidency </p><p>will remain nothing more than a fond dream. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>19. (C) A close Babangida associate told us recently that </p><p>Former Head of State Babangida is trying to broker a </p><p>solution. The proposed arrangement would reverse the </p><p>regional division of the ticket in 2007 but without the same </p><p>individuals on the ticket. IBB reportedly has Ekweume in </p><p>mind as President and Umaru Shinkafi as the preferred number </p><p>two. IBB reportedly has decided, for now, not to run.  Given </p><p>their age and long experience in supporting roles, IBB </p><p>likely believes both Ekweume and Shinkafi will be pliable </p><p>"team players" and will not seek second terms. This tack </p><p>would preserve a "vacancy at Aso Rock" for 2007, by which </p><p>time, his supporters believe, the controversy surrounding </p><p>IBB will have abated. An Ekwueme/Shinkafi ticket would also </p><p>end most of the (limited) elite support for former Head of </p><p>State Buhari\'s candidacy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>WHERE HAVE ALL THE ISSUES GONE? </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>20. (C) All recent discussions with politicians invariably </p><p>center on the presidential campaign. Remarks of politicians </p><p>in both camps, while fecund with regard to power politics, </p><p>tend to be sterile when it comes to substantive issues such </p><p>as poverty alleviation and economic reform, not to mention </p><p>foreign policy. Most politicians\' forays into substance are </p><p>brief and concentrate on the allegedly poor job that the </p><p>opponent will do or is doing. Daily newspapers and weekly </p><p>magazines are replete with reporting on the presidential </p><p>politicking. Yet, the dribble of ink devoted to actual </p><p>issues is minimal when compared to pool devoted to the </p><p>machinations of the political class. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>21. (C) Upon observing the tenor and tactics of the </p><p>presidential campaign so far, further democratization will </p><p>require the gradual transformation of Nigeria\'s political </p><p>culture in two basic ways. First, the Nigerian political </p><p>system remains a very closed shop -- a person needs a lot of </p><p>money or personal connections to enter it. The elitism that </p><p>governs the current system must be eroded so that more </p><p>people from various walks of life can enhance the mix. </p><p>Second, political affiliations need to be based more on </p><p>issues and less on ethnic and regional considerations. </p><p>Realistically, this will take time and progress will be </p><p>gradual. However, it was hoped that the 2003 elections would </p><p>be another link in this concatenation of strengthening </p><p>Nigerian democracy. Sadly, this is not happening. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>22. (C) The President\'s bare-knuckle strategy, personified </p><p>by the unprincipled Anenih, and the opposition\'s regional </p><p>axis approach, personified by the Machiavellian Babangida, </p><p>have placed the process of genuine democratization in </p><p>"spiritual deepfreeze." While neither side is devoid of </p><p>issue content, efforts to delineate substantive differences </p><p>are pro forma. The two camps operate on a different plane. </p><p>Basically, the President\'s campaign is using the party </p><p>machinery and the tools of office to create a nationwide </p><p>network of incumbents that will help each other get </p><p>reelected, with the connivance of hand-picked electoral </p><p>officials. On the other hand, the opposition is promoting </p><p>ethnic populism by appealing to the base instincts of two </p><p>(Igbo and Hausa/Fulani) of Nigeria\'s three main ethnic </p><p>groups. Thus, despite increasingly frenetic electioneering, </p><p>somehow the idea of crafting an appeal to entire Nigerian </p><p>electorate has been lost in shuffle. Because of this, many </p><p>people sense that, though the politicians are energetically </p><p>fighting each other, neither side is really fighting for the </p><p>interests of the average Nigerian or the country as a whole. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ANDREWS </p><p></p></div>
