<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001378 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PDPA FOR DALTON, MITCHELL AND SIMS </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION POWELL OP-ED ON ZIM UNDER FIRE; </p><p>HARARE </p><p> </p><p>  1.   The lead article in the June 27 edition of the </p><p>      government-controlled daily "The Herald" and an </p><p>      op-ed in the same edition collectively criticize </p><p>      Secretary of State Colin Powell for writing an op-ed </p><p>      column in the "New York Times" criticizing Robert </p><p>      Mugabe\'s government.  Excerpts follow: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   Under headline "Fuel talks continue: Leaders attack U. </p><p>      S.\' renewed onslaught against Harare" the "The Herald" </p><p>      (06/27) carried the following article by Itai Musengengeyi, </p><p>      who filed the report from Tripoli, Libya where Robert </p><p>      Mugabe is consumed in bilateral talks with his counterpart </p><p>      Colonel Muammar Gadaffi: </p><p> </p><p>      "President Mugabe and his Libyan counterpart Colonel </p><p>      Muammar Gaddafi. . .on their first round of </p><p>      consultations on Wednesday. . .noted with concern </p><p>      the United States\' renewed onslaught on Zimbabwe and </p><p>      agreed that the AU Summit should unambiguously </p><p>      condemn Western imperialism.  This followed U. S. </p><p>      Secretary of State Mr. Colin Powell\'s criticism of </p><p>      Zimbabwe\'s land reform, which he claimed had not </p><p>      benefited ordinary people. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>  3.   Under headline "Keep your aid, U. S.: West, MDC </p><p>      peddling lies on Zimbabwe" the same newspaper carried the </p><p>      following op-ed on page 27 by an unnamed "correspondent": </p><p> </p><p>      "I have always asked how much Zimbabwe is worth.  Is </p><p>      it worth the filthy American dollars Colin Powell is </p><p>      now promising gullible and useless Zimbabweans so </p><p>      that they betray President Mugabe?  My answer is </p><p>      that Zimbabwe is worth much more than Powell is </p><p>      promising us in the form of aid. . .Powell is </p><p>      relying on lies from the U. S. and British embassies </p><p>      in Harare and also from the sellouts in the MDC </p><p>      (Movement for Democratic Change).  The violence he </p><p>      talks about is being perpetrated by the MDC and not </p><p>      the government of Zimbabwe. . .Powell is the worst </p><p>      hypocrite I have ever seen.  He dances to the tune </p><p>      of his masters.  U. S. President George Bush knows </p><p>      that if he talks too much on Zimbabwe it would be </p><p>      viewed as racism and he sends his Uncle Tom in the </p><p>      form of Powell to do his dirty work.  What a shame. </p><p>      . .To Powell, we say keep your filthy dollars to </p><p>      yourself and we will keep our country. . .Keep your </p><p>      aid and channel it to the families of those whose </p><p>      bread-winners were killed in Iraq after you lied to </p><p>      the world that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass </p><p>      destruction. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
