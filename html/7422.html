<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABU DHABI 001791 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR IRAQ TASK FORCE, ALSO NEA/ARP, NEA/RA, </p><p>PRM/ANE, AND IO/UNP </p><p>KUWAIT FOR HOC </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL 04/14/13 </p><p>TAGS: EAID, PREL, PGOV, PHUM, IZ, TC </p><p>SUBJECT:  TFIZ01: UAE RED CRESCENT SHIP FINALLY </p><p>ARRIVES AT UMM QASR: LESSONS LEARNED </p><p> </p><p>REFS: ABU DHABI 1660 AND PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) Classified by DCM Richard A. Albright for </p><p>reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Summary and comment: The UAE\'s much-heralded </p><p>shipment of 700 tons of humanitarian supplies arrived </p><p>at Umm Qasr on April 11 -- the first water shipment to </p><p>arrive via civilian vessel into that port since the </p><p>war began.  The political importance of this shipment </p><p>was significant: both as a manifestation of the </p><p>world\'s (and particularly the Arab world\'s) commitment </p><p>to alleviate human suffering in Iraq, and -- for the </p><p>domestic UAE audience -- as a demonstration of the </p><p>UAE\'s effectiveness in promptly getting needed aid to </p><p>its destination.  This is certainly only the first of </p><p>what will be many humanitarian shipments to Umm Qasr; </p><p>we offer up our observations on lessons learned -- </p><p>namely, the importance of coordination and flexibility </p><p>all around -- for other posts which may be asked to </p><p>facilitate such shipments. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Following a reported March 25 attack on UAE </p><p>Red Crescent workers traveling overland from Amman to </p><p>Baghdad (reftel), the RCA decided to coordinate its </p><p>next shipment of 700 tons of foodstuff, family first </p><p>aid kits, four water tankers, two cargo trucks, an </p><p>ambulance, and several passenger vehicles through the </p><p>HOC via Embassy Abu Dhabi.  Well aware of the unstable </p><p>security situation in southern Iraq, UAE Armed Forces </p><p>Chief of Staff Shaykh Mohammed bin Zayid Al-Nahyan </p><p>took over the coordination of the shipment from the </p><p>RCA -- a sign of the high importance attached to this </p><p>effort by the UAE leadership. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>Lesson One: Coordination With HOC, NAVCENT Essential </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) From the beginning, Econoff alerted the HOC, </p><p>CENTCOM (through USLO), and NAVCENT (through the DAO </p><p>Naval Attache) that the UAEG, on behalf of the Red </p><p>Crescent Authority was organizing a shipment of </p><p>humanitarian supplies to Umm Qasr.  NAVCENT and the </p><p>HOC requested a number of documents from the Emiratis, </p><p>including the specifics of the ship (including ship\'s </p><p>name, flag, registry, and international call sign), </p><p>ship\'s draft (draft in Umm Qasr is limited from 7.3 to </p><p>9.5 meters due to silt build-up and underwater </p><p>obstacles), owner and agent of the ship, detailed crew </p><p>and passenger manifests with full names and </p><p>nationalities (plus passport information to facilitate </p><p>clearances), and a detailed cargo manifest. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Close coordination with NAVCENT was critical </p><p>to the operation.  Once the vessel was underway for </p><p>Umm Qasr, NAVCENT was able to provide Post with </p><p>updates on the location of the ship, and communicated </p><p>to us what would be required of the ship\'s crew and </p><p>the UAE delegation along the way.  This line of </p><p>communication helped us sensitize the ship\'s crew and </p><p>passengers (including four journalists) to the </p><p>thorough security checks and inspections that were </p><p>likely to take place at the checkpoint and/or at the </p><p>port. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>Lesson Two: Prepare For Last-Minute Changes </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Post forwarded to the HOC and NAVCENT all </p><p>manifests and ship documentation 48 hours prior to the </p><p>vessel\'s departure from Dubai.  Due to last minute </p><p>mechanical problems, the UAEG was required to find </p><p>another ship willing to sail to Iraq in less than 24 </p><p>hours.  Last minute questions arose concerning the </p><p>offloading capabilities of the vessel (currently, </p><p>there is no power at Umm Qasr), the UAE delegates\' </p><p>plans to remain in Umm Qasr to distribute the </p><p>supplies, and significant revisions to the crew </p><p>manifest by the vessel owner -- which required NAVCENT </p><p>to undertake additional security precautions. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>Lesson Four: Encourage Direct Contact With ICRC </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>7.  (C) Post relayed to the RCA that it would be </p><p>responsible for the distribution of the items once the </p><p>ship arrived in Iraq.  Indeed, the RCA had insisted </p><p>that its personnel alone would arrange the delivery of </p><p>the relief shipment inside Iraq.  Although the HOC </p><p>provided contact information for the ICRC and the </p><p>Kuwaiti Red Crescent to the RCA, it appears that the </p><p>RCA did not finalize its distribution plans with its </p><p>counterparts in Iraq, leading to delays in getting the </p><p>aid to those who need it.  We understand, however, </p><p>that the HOC has assisted the UAE delegation in </p><p>lashing up with the ICRC/Kuwaiti Red Crescent to </p><p>facilitate distribution of the goods. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>All\'s Well That Ends Well </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) We were impressed by the can-do attitude and </p><p>flexibility exhibited by representatives in the HOC, </p><p>who effortlessly managed eleventh hour changes in the </p><p>vessel and its crew, and coordinated the shipment </p><p>between the various branches of the Coalition forces. </p><p>CFLCC and NAVCENT were similarly cooperative and </p><p>helpful, promptly answering even the most arcane of </p><p>questions.  The head of the UAE delegation already has </p><p>contacted Post directly and via the MFA to offer his </p><p>thanks to all involved for facilitating the shipment </p><p>(which has received stellar coverage in the local </p><p>media), and noted specifically the professionalism and </p><p>courtesy of the troops the UAE delegates encountered </p><p>along the way.  We second his thanks. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
