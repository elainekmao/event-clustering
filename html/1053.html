(C)  SUMMARY. THIS WEEKEND SAW THREE </p><p>DEATHS ASSOCIATED WITH POLITICAL ACTIVITY, </p><p>APPARENTLY THE START OF WHAT MANY OBSERVERS </p><p>THINK WILL BE A SEASON OF ELECTION-RELATED </p><p>VIOLENCE FOR ZIMBABWE.  PRESIDENT MUGABE </p><p>REMAINS INTRANSIGENT IN DEFYING THE COURTS </p><p>OVER ONGOING FARM OCCUPATIONS, AND APPEARED </p><p>UNMOVED BY THE DEATHS.  HIS MAIN POLITICAL </p><p>OPPOSITION CONTINUES TO APPEAR MORE NIMBLE </p><p>THAN MUGABE IN ATTEMPTING TO GARNER </p><p>POLITICAL SUPPORT.  WE FORESEE NO QUICK END </p><p>TO THE SPORADIC VIOLENCE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>  SOWING THE DRAGON\'S TEETH </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  TWO MEMBERS OF THE MOVEMENT FOR </p><p>DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC), THE MAIN POLITICAL </p><p>OPPOSITION PARTY, WERE KILLED APRIL 15 IN </p><p>WHAT LOCAL OBSERVERS BELIEVE TO BE A </p><p>POLITICALLY-INSPIRED ATTACK.  ONE OF THE </p><p>DEAD WAS THE OFFICIAL CHAUFFEUR FOR MDC </p><p>LEADER MORGAN TSVANGIRAI.  HE HAD BEEN </p><p>TRANSPORTING MDC SUPPORTERS HOME FROM A </p><p>POLITICAL RALLY WHEN HIS TRUCK WAS ATTACKED </p><p>AND STOPPED BY GUN-TOTING ASSAILANTS, WHO </p><p>PROCEEDED TO FIREBOMB THE VEHICLE.  THE TWO </p><p>DECEASED WERE TRAPPED IN THE TRUCK AND DIED </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02120  01 OF 03  171528Z </p><p>OF BURNS.  THE SUPPORTERS THAT HAD BEEN </p><p>PASSENGERS ESCAPED LARGELY UNHARMED. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  ALSO ON APRIL 15, A WHITE FARMER </p><p>WAS SHOT TO DEATH IN A CLASH WITH SOME OF </p><p>THE SO-CALLED "WAR VETERANS" WHO HAD BEEN </p><p>OCCUPYING HIS FARM.  THIS FIRST FARMER </p><p>CASUALTY OF THE GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED </p><p>OCCUPATION CAMPAIGN RESULTED WHEN THE FARMER </p><p>BACKED UP HIS LABORERS TO ATTEMPT TO GET THE </p><p>OCCUPIERS OFF HIS FARM. WHILE HE AND HIS </p><p>LABORERS WERE INITIALLY SUCCESSFUL, THE </p><p>OCCUPIERS, WITH HELP FROM OTHERS IN THE </p><p>AREA, REORGANIZED AND COUNTERATTACKED.  IT </p><p>IS EVIDENT THAT THE OCCUPIERS ARE PREPARED </p><p>TO ESCALATE VIOLENCE IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN </p><p>THEIR PRESENCE AGAINST FORCEFUL ATTEMPTS BY </p><p>FARMERS TO EVICT THEM AND HAVE ORGANIZED </p><p>THEMSELVES TO A CERTAIN DEGREE. </p><p> </p><p>MUGABE DEFIANT ON FARM OCCUPATIONS </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  PRESIDENT MUGABE RETURNED ON </p><p>SUNDAY, APRIL 16, FROM THE G-77 SUMMIT TO A </p><p>RENT-A-CROWD RECEPTION AT HARARE AIRPORT, </p><p>WHERE HIS PUBLIC REMARKS UNDERLINED HIS </p><p>INTRANSIGENCE ON THE LAND OCCUPATION ISSUE. </p><p>CONTINUING THE LINE OF ARGUMENT HE MADE AT </p><p>THE SUMMIT, MUGABE MADE IT CLEAR THAT HE </p><p>WILL NOT SUPPORT ATTEMPTS TO CLEAR THE </p><p>OCCUPIERS FROM THE FARMS, MUCH LESS ORDER </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02120  01 OF 03  171528Z </p><p>POLICE TO FOLLOW THE RECENT COURT ORDERS </p><p>THAT THEY SHOULD DO SO.  THIS CAME IN </p><p>COMPLETE CONTRAST TO ACTING PRESIDENT </p><p>MSIKA\'S APRIL 14 DECLARATION THAT THE </p><p>COURT\'S RULING TO WITHDRAW FROM THE OCCUPIED </p><p>FARMS SHOULD BE HEEDED.  IN WHAT MUST HAVE </p><p>STRUCK MORE THAN A FEW IMPARTIAL OBSERVERS </p><p>AS A NEW LEVEL OF HYPOCRISY, MUGABE ARGUED </p><p>THAT ENFORCING THE COURT ORDERS WOULD BE A </p><p>DANGEROUS ESCALATION OF VIOLENCE. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  PART OF MUGABE\'S AND THE POLICE\'S </p><p>ARGUMENT AGAINST HAVING THE POLICE FORCE </p><p>MOVE AGAINST THE FARM OCCUPIERS HAS BEEN </p><p>THAT THE POLICE LACK THE NECESSARY </p><p>RESOURCES.  CURIOUSLY, WHEN RUMORS FILLED </p><p>HARARE THAT A NON-ZANU-PF POLITICAL RALLY </p><p>WAS PLANNED FOR SATURDAY, THE POLICE HAD NO </p><p>DIFFICULTY MAKING THEIR PRESENCE KNOWN. </p><p>THERE WERE ROVING PATROLS OF RIOT-EQUIPPED </p><p>OFFICERS IN THE DOWNTOWN BUSINESS AREA, </p><p>MOVING IN GROUPS OF FIVE TO TEN.  FURTHER </p><p>POLICE MANPOWER LOUNGED IN SEVERAL ARMORED </p><p>CARS PARKED NEAR PARLIAMENT, AND POLICE </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ4189 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  02120  02 OF 03  171528Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    ACQ-00   CIAE-00  SMEC-00  SRPP-00  DS-00 </p><p>      VC-01    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01   L-00 </p><p>      AC-01    NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00 </p><p>      PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SCT-00   SP-00    IRM-00   TRSE-00 </p><p>      USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00 </p><p>        /010W </p><p>                  ------------------4CB336  171535Z /38 </p><p>R 171532Z APR 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 5782 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC </p><p>SECDEF WASHINGTON DC </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 HARARE 002120 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR AF A/S RICE, AF POAS POWELL, </p><p>AF DAS </p><p>SCHNEIDMAN, AF/S DIRECTOR RENDER, AF/S DESK </p><p>OFFICER GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 4/17/10 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, ZI </p><p> </p><p>SUBJECT: WEEKEND VIOLENCE NOTCHES UP </p><p>POLITICAL TENSION </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  02120  02 OF 03  171528Z </p><p> </p><p>ROADBLOCKS ON MAJOR TRAFFIC ARTERIES HEADING </p><p>INTO TOWN CAUSED MAJOR TRAFFIC BACK-UPS AS </p><p>OFFICERS SLOWLY SEARCHED OR INSPECTED THE </p><p>INTERIOR OF ALL PASSING VEHICLES.

(C)  FURTHER TO THE LAND ISSUE, THE </p><p>BRITISH HIGH COMMISSIONER IN HARARE TOLD </p><p>AMBASSADOR MCDONALD DURING LUNCH ON APRIL 17 </p><p>THAT THE BRITISH HAVE PROPOSED TO THE GOZ </p><p>THAT THEY SEND A DELEGATION TO LONDON ON </p><p>APRIL 27 FOR BILATERAL LAND REFORM </p><p>DISCUSSIONS. </p><p> </p><p>MDC STILL THINKING AHEAD, ZANU-PF NOT </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  IN THE MORE PURELY POLITICAL ARENA, </p><p>THE MDC SPONSORED ADS IN MAJOR NEWSPAPERS </p><p>THIS WEEKEND URGING THEIR URBAN-BASED </p><p>SUPPORTERS TO PICK UP INFORMATION PAMPHLETS </p><p>TO TAKE WITH THEM AS THEY RETURN TO THEIR </p><p>RURAL FAMILIES OVER THE UPCOMING LONG EASTER </p><p>WEEKEND.

(C)  IN CONTRAST, NEWS FROM THE ZANU-PF </p><p>FRONT SHOWS THEY HAVE A CONSIDERABLE </p><p>OISTANCE TO GO BEFORE THEY ARE IN TUNE WITH </p><p>THE MOOO OF THEIR PUTATIVE SUPPORTERS. </p><p>ACCOROING TO NEWS REPORTS MONOAY MORNING, </p><p>VICE PRESIOENT MSIKA WAS BOOEO OVER THE </p><p>WEEKENO WHEN HIS SPEECH AT THE FUNERAL OF </p><p>THE EXECUTIVE MAYOR OF BULAWAYO STRAYED INTO </p><p>AN ATTACK ON MDC PRESIDENT TSVANGIRAI. </p><p> </p><p>   COMMENT </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  THE NO-HOLDS-BARRED POLITICAL </p><p>SEASON IS NOW APPARENTLY OPEN IN ZIMBABWE. </p><p>OUR READING OF LOCAL REACTION TO THE WEEKEND </p><p>VIOLENCE IS THAT THERE IS CONSIDERABLE SHOCK </p><p>AND DISMAY THAT THINGS HAVE COME TO THIS </p><p>PASS.  NO ONE IS LOOKING TO A QUICK END TO </p><p>WHAT LOCALS SEE AS A ZANU-PF INTIMIDATION </p><p>CAMPAIGN. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C)  THIS IS A TIME OF TESTING FOR THE </p><p>MDC.

SO FAR THEIR </p><p>OFFICIAL REACTION HAS BEEN LOW KEY.  WE HAVE </p><p>NOT HEARD OF PLANS FOR RETALIATION. IT IS </p><p>STILL TOO EARLY TO TELL WHAT EFFECT THESE </p><p>EVENTS WILL HAVE ON THEIR SUPPORTERS, BUT WE </p><p>SENSE MANY VOTERS HERE EXPECTED POLITICAL </p><p>CONFLICT TO CAUSE LOSS OF LIFE EVENTUALLY, </p><p>AND WILL NOT BE PUT OFF BY SPORADIC </p><p>VIOLENCE. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C)  FOR ZANU-PF, THE TIME TO RESCUE </p><p>WHATEVER POLITICAL CREDIBILITY THEY HAVE IS </p><p>NOW.  WE SENSE THERE ARE CONSIDERABLE RIFTS </p><p>WITHIN THE RULING PARTY OVER THE FARM </p><p>OCCUPATIONS.  VICE PRESIDENT MSIKA SURELY </p><p>WAS NOT SPEAKING SOLELY FOR HIMSELF WHEN HE </p><p>GREETED WITH SOME APPARENT ENTHUSIASM LAST </p><p>WEEK\'S COURT DECISION THAT POLICE SHOULD </p><p>EVICT THE FARM INVADERS--A BLATANT </p><p>CONTRADICTION OF WHAT, SINCE MUGABE HAS </p><p>SPOKEN, IS NOW OFFICIAL PARTY POLICY.  WE DO </p><p>NOT KNOW HOW FAR THESE POLICY SPLITS RUN ON </p><p>OTHER ISSUES, BUT POLITICIANS WHO EXPECT TO </p><p>HAVE A CAREER HERE BEYOND THE MUGABE ERA </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ4190 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  02120  03 OF 03  171528Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    ACQ-00   CIAE-00  SMEC-00  SRPP-00  DS-00 </p><p>      VC-01    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01   L-00 </p><p>      AC-01    NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00 </p><p>      PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SCT-00   SP-00    TRSE-00  USIE-00 </p><p>      PMB-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /010W </p><p>                  ------------------4CB33A  171535Z /38 </p><p>R 171532Z APR 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 5783 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC </p><p>SECDEF WASHINGTON DC </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 HARARE 002120 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR AF A/S RICE, AF POAS POWELL, </p><p>AF DAS </p><p>SCHNEIDMAN, AF/S DIRECTOR RENDER, AF/S DESK </p><p>OFFICER GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 4/17/10 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, ZI </p><p> </p><p>SUBJECT: WEEKEND VIOLENCE NOTCHES UP </p><p>POLITICAL TENSION </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  02120  03 OF 03  171528Z </p><p>MUST BE LOOKING WITH SOME CONSTERNATION AT </p><p>THE CURRENT GROWTH OF CHAOS.
