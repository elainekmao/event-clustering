<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 000363 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/ERIEDEL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, ELTN, NP, IN, XD, India Relations </p><p>SUBJECT: INDO-NEPAL COMMERCIAL TRANSPORTATION </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS STALL </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  ON FEBRUARY 10-14, REPRESENTATIVES FROM INDIA AND </p><p>NEPAL MET IN KATHMANDU TO NEGOTIATE RAILWAY AND TRANS- </p><p>BORDER MOTOR VEHICLE TRAFFIC AGREEMENTS, WITH LIMITED </p><p>RESULTS.  THE GOVERNMENT OF NEPAL (GON), UNDER </p><p>SIGNIFICANT PRESSURE TO OPEN ITS WORLD BANK-FUNDED </p><p>INLAND CONTAINER DEPOT (ICD), MADE A NUMBER OF </p><p>COMPROMISES INCLUDING AGREEING TO INDIAN MANAGEMENT </p><p>OF THE DEPOT AND TO REDUNDANT CUSTOMS PROCEDURES FOR </p><p>TRANSITING CARGO.  INDIA\'S INSISTS ON LINKING </p><p>CONCESSIONS MADE MOTOR VEHICLE TRAFFIC TO PROGRESS ON </p><p>A RAILWAY AGREEMENT.  INDIA\'S NEGOTIATING PLOY COMES </p><p>AT THE EXPENSE OF NEPALI CONSUMERS AND EXPORTERS, WHO </p><p>WOULD BENEFIT FROM THE ESTIMATED FORTY PERCENT </p><p>REDUCTION IN TRANSPORTATION COSTS THAT WOULD ENSUE </p><p>FROM IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ICD.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>NEPAL-INDIA TRANSPORTATION NEGOTIATIONS </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  ON FEBRUARY 10-14, REPRESENTATIVES FROM INDIA AND </p><p>NEPAL MET IN KATHMANDU FOR THE THIRD ROUND OF TALKS </p><p>ON THE NEPAL-INDIA RAILWAYS AGREEMENT (NIRA) AND </p><p>REGULATION OF TRANS-BORDER MOVEMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES </p><p>(RTMMV).  THE NEGOTIATIONS WERE HELD IN CONSECUTIVE </p><p>MEETINGS DURING THE WEEK BUT WITH FEW RESULTS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NIRA KEY TO NEPAL\'S TRADE FUTURE </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA </p><p>(GOI) AND OF THE GOVERNMENT OF NEPAL (GON) FACED THE </p><p>SAME THORNY ISSUES IDENTIFIED IN THE FIRST TWO </p><p>NEGOTIATING ROUNDS ON THE RAILWAY TREATY, IDENTIFYING </p><p>AN OPERATOR FOR THE BIRGUNJ INLAND CONTAINER DEPOT </p><p>(ICD) AND AGREEING TO SIMPLIFIED CUSTOMS CLEARANCE </p><p>PROCEDURES.  THE GON IS UNDER PRESSURE TO CONCLUDE </p><p>THE AGREEMENT, AS THE ICD IS IN DEFAULT TO THE WORLD </p><p>BANK FOR THE USD 28.5 MILLION PROJECT.  THE WORLD </p><p>BANK HAS EXTENDED THE DEADLINE FOR THE ICD\'S </p><p>OPERATION TO SEPTEMBER 2003; SHOULD IT LAPSE, THE </p><p>BANK MAY BE FORCED TO LIQUIDATE THE FACILITY.  (NOTE: </p><p>TWO OTHER ICDS IN BHAIRAHAWA AND BIRATNAGAR ARE </p><p>ALREADY IN OPERATION, WHILE THE BIRGUNJ FACILITY, </p><p>WHICH IS THE ONLY FACILITY WITH RAIL CONNECTIONS AND </p><p>THE TRADITIONAL TRADE ROUTE WITH THE PORTS IN </p><p>KOLKATA, IS YET TO OPEN.  END NOTE.)  ONCE THE </p><p>BIRGUNJ ICD COMES INTO FULL OPERATION, TRANSPORTATION </p><p>COSTS FOR NEPALI EXPORTERS, MOST OF WHOSE GOODS </p><p>TRANSIT INDIA, ARE EXPECTED TO DROP BY 40 PERCENT. </p><p> </p><p>4.  INDIA HAS DELAYED FINALIZATION OF A RAILWAY </p><p>AGREEMENT, INSISTING ON INSPECTING CONTAINERS BOTH AT </p><p>THE PORT OF ENTRY AND ON THE INDIAN SIDE OF THE </p><p>BORDER BEFORE ENTRY INTO NEPAL.  THE GON HAS INSISTED </p><p>ON A "ONE-TIME LOCK" SYSTEM, ENSURING DIRECT ENTRY OF </p><p>THE CONTAINERS TO THE ICD ONCE THEY HAD BEEN </p><p>INSPECTED AND LOCKED IN KOLKATA, INDIA. INDIA HAS </p><p>ALSO STIPULATED THAT, IN POSSIBLE CONTRAVENTION OF </p><p>THE TERMS OF THE WORLD BANK LOAN, THAT THE CONTRACT </p><p>FOR OPERATING THE ICD INCORPORATE AN INDIAN MANAGER. </p><p>ACCORDING TO NEPAL\'S LEAD NEGOTIATOR, PURUSHOTTAM </p><p>OJHA OF THE MINISTRY OF INDUSTRY, COMMERCE, AND </p><p>SUPPLY, NEPAL CONCEDED TO INDIA\'S DEMANDS.  FOR THEIR </p><p>PART, INDIAN NEGOTIATORS AGREED TO SIMPLIFY DOCUMENT </p><p>REQUIREMENTS AND CUSTOMS CLEARANCE PROCEDURES. </p><p> </p><p>NEPAL-INDIA MOTOR VEHICLE TRANSPORTATION TALKS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>6.  NEPAL AND INDIA HELD SEPARATE BILATERAL </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS ON THE REGULATION OF TRANS-BORDER </p><p>MOVEMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES (RTMMV), WHICH ALSO </p><p>GARNERED FEW RESULTS.  THE NEGOTIATIONS FOCUSED ON </p><p>TWO AREAS OF CONCERN: PASSENGER TRANSPORTATION AND </p><p>CARGO TRANSPORTATION. </p><p> </p><p>7.  ACCORDING TO DR. MADAN BHATTARAI, MINISTRY OF </p><p>FOREIGN AFFAIRS JOINT SECRETARY FOR SOUTH ASIA, GON </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES OFFERED DIRECT BUS SERVICES TO 11 </p><p>MAJOR NEPALI CITIES FOR INDIAN BUS OPERATORS. </p><p>HOWEVER, INDIA, CITING SECURITY CONCERNS, REPORTEDLY </p><p>STOOD FIRM IN BARRING DIRECT ACCESS FOR NEPALI </p><p>VEHICLES TO MAJOR CITIES LIKE DELHI, KOLKATA, AND </p><p>PATNA, LEADING NEPAL TO DENY ENTRY INTO KATHMANDU AND </p><p>POKHARA.  IN TERMS OF CARGO TRANSPORTATION, INDIA </p><p>REQUESTED THE FREE PASSAGE OF CARGO VEHICLES WITHIN </p><p>NEPAL.  NEPALI TRUCKING COMPANIES AND THEIR </p><p>ASSOCIATIONS EFFECTIVELY PRESSURED THE GON DENY THE </p><p>INDIAN REQUEST.  NEPALI TRANSPORT COMPANIES FELT </p><p>THREATENED, AS CARGO COMING FROM INDIA AND INDIAN </p><p>PORTS WOULD NO LONGER REQUIRE TRANSFER TO NEPALI </p><p>CARRIERS AND NEPALI OPERATORS HAVE LITTLE CONFIDENCE </p><p>THEY WOULD RECEIVE RECIPROCAL TRANSIT RIGHTS IN </p><p>PRACTICE. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p>8.  OBSERVERS HERE ARE SKEPTICAL OF AN EARLY </p><p>RESOLUTION TO THE PROBLEMS RAISED DURING THE NIRA AND </p><p>RTMMV NEGOTIATIONS.  INDIA\'S NEGOTIATING TACTICS ON </p><p>NIRA LEVERAGE NEPAL\'S DEPENDENCE ON INDIAN PORTS, AND </p><p>ITS LIABILITY TO THE WORLD BANK FOR THE CONTAINER </p><p>DEPOT.  DUE TO THE OPEN BORDER, INDIA\'S CROSS-BORDER </p><p>SECURITY CONCERNS DO NOT STAND UP TO SCRUTINY AND </p><p>APPEAR TO BE ANOTHER MEANS TO DEFLECT NEPAL\'S </p><p>REQUESTS FOR RECIPROCAL COMMERCIAL BUS OPERATIONS. </p><p>IN WHAT APPEARS TO BE ANOTHER CALCULATED MOVE, INDIA </p><p>HAS TIED CONCESSIONS ON CARGO TRUCKS TO OPENING THE </p><p>CRITICAL ICD FACILITY TO RAIL TRAFFIC.  THE </p><p>DIPLOMATIC MANEUVERING OVER THESE AGREEMENTS COMES AT </p><p>THE EXPENSE OF NEPALESE CONSUMERS AND EXPORTERS, WHO </p><p>FACE HIGHER COSTS.  CONTINUED DELAY ONLY BENEFITS </p><p>INDIA, AS A MEANS OF PRESSURING NEPAL INTO MAKING </p><p>DEEPER CONCESSIONS. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
