<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 03 NAIROBI 006573 </p><p> </p><p>FROM EMBASSY KHARTOUM OFFICE </p><p>LONDON FOR YOUNG, PARIS FOR MORAN, BRUSSELS FOR JOHNSON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  05/14/06 </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, PTER, PINS, PINR, EAID, UN, SU </p><p>SUBJECT:  SUDAN:  FOREIGN MINISTER ON CIVIL WAR, TERRORISM </p><p> </p><p>1.  CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR TO SUDAN TIMOTHY CARNEY. </p><p>REASON 1.5(D). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S)  SUMMARY AND COMMENT.  THE SUDANESE FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER REAFFIRMED TO ME MAY 10 THAT KHARTOUM HAS MADE </p><p>A DECISION THAT TERRORIST GROUPS MUST GO AND IS WORKING </p><p>TO COMPILE MEMBERSHIP LISTS.  HE BELIEVES RENEGADE </p><p>SAUDI TERROR FINANCIER USAMA BIN LADEN NEEDS TO START </p><p>TALKING TO WESTERN DIPLOMATS.  I REBUFFED HIS ATTEMPT </p><p>TO INVOLVE THE U.S. IN RESTORING SUDAN\'S RELATIONS WITH </p><p>ETHIOPIA AND UGANDA. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  THE MINISTER ASKED THAT THE U.S. CONVEY TO THE </p><p>SUDANESE PEOPLE\'S LIBERATION MOVEMENT (SPLM) LEADER </p><p>THAT KHARTOUM IS OPEN TO SPLM IDEAS TO SOLVE THE CIVIL </p><p>WAR; THAT THE GOS IS PROCEEDING WITH NO HIDDEN AGENDA, </p><p>AND IS OPEN TO VENUE AND PLAYERS TO GET TALKS STARTED. </p><p>MY REPLY WAS THAT KHARTOUM MUST MAKE CONCRETE GESTURES </p><p>TO BUILD TRUST AND I SUGGESTED SOME WHICH MIGHT BE </p><p>TIMED TO THE 20 MAY UNESCO/UNDP MEET ON SUDANESE </p><p>HUMANITARIAN PROBLEMS IN THE NETHERLANDS.. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  THE GOS IS ONLY SLOWLY PROCEEDING TO ACT ON </p><p>THEIR HIGH-LEVEL STATEMENTS OF INTENT TO ANSWER U.S. </p><p>CONCERNS ON SUDANESE HAVEN AND SUPPORT FOR TERRORISM. </p><p>I SUGGESTED THEY HAVE A WINDOW OF 45-90 DAYS TO PROVE </p><p>GOOD FAITH, NOW THAT THEIR NEW CABINET IS IN PLACE. </p><p>THE KHARTOUM EFFORT TO START PEACE TALKS WITH THE SOUTH </p><p>LOOKS SERIOUS.  UNSCR 1054 HAS GOTTEN ATTENTION </p><p>THROUGHOUT THE SUDANESE CAPITAL.   BUT, IF THE FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER\'S COMMENTS REFLECT THE REALITY, KHARTOUM DOES </p><p>NOT/NOT GRASP HOW COMPLETELY IT IS UP TO THEM TO CUT A </p><p>DEAL WITH THE ETHIOPIANS IF SUDAN HAS, AS SEEMS LIKELY, </p><p>SPIRITED THE THREE MUBARAK PLOT TERRORISTS OUT OF </p><p>SUDAN.  END SUMMARY AND COMMENT </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>CIVIL WAR </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  FOREIGN MINISTER ALI OSMAN MOHAMMED TAHA MET </p><p>ME AFTER PRAYERS ON RETURNING FROM THE HAJ VIA MALAYSIA </p><p>FRIDAY, 10 MAY, TO TALK ABOUT PEACE EFFORTS WITH THE </p><p>SOUTH AND, ON DISMISSING NOTETAKERS, TO MAKE POINTS ON </p><p>THE GOS EFFORTS TO RESPOND TO AMERICAN CONCERNS ON </p><p>TERRORISM (SEPTEL-NOTAL).  AFTER ASSURING HIMSELF THAT </p><p>I RECEIVED HIS FAX REPLY TO MY LETTER DETAILING SPLM </p><p>REACTION TO THE FIRST MESSAGE FROM KHARTOUM (NAIROBI </p><p>4836-NOTAL), TAHA SAID THAT KHARTOUM IS COMMITTED TO </p><p>DEMONSTRATING ITS SINCERITY IN REACHING A COMPREHENSIVE </p><p>PEACE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  HE SAW SCOPE IN SOME SPLM </p><p>REMARKS IN THE WAKE OF THE 10 APRIL "PEACE CHARTER," </p><p>SIGNED WITH THE SPLINTER SOUTH SUDAN INDEPENDENCE </p><p>MOVEMENT (SSIM), TO INDUCE THE MAJOR INSURGENT MOVEMENT </p><p>TO JOIN IN.  HE SAID THAT THE KEY ISSUES ARE IN THE 10 </p><p>APRIL ACCORD, WHICH AIMED TO CREATE AN ATMOSPHERE TO </p><p>GET SERIOUS TALKS STARTED.  HE WAS ASTONISHED WHEN I </p><p>SAID THAT ALL SOUTHERN INTERLOCUTORS EXCEPT LAWYER AND </p><p>FORMER SUDANESE VICE-PRESIDENT ABEL ALIER HAD VIEWED </p><p>THE PEACE CHARTER AS A "TAKE-IT-OR LEAVE IT" DOCUMENT. </p><p>A LAWYER HIMSELF, TAHA AGREED WITH THE CHARACTERIZATION </p><p>OF HIS CHIEF OF PROTOCOL WHO HAD EARLIER DESCRIBED THE </p><p>EFFORT AS ONE OF "IGNITION." </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  I RECALLED THE MINISTER\'S OWN RECOGNITION OF </p><p>THE MISTRUST AND SUSPICION THAT CAUSED TAHA TO SEEK </p><p>INTERMEDIARIES TO GET A PEACE PROCESS STARTED.  THE GOS </p><p>NEEDS TO BUILD TRUST AND A NUMBER OF POSSIBLE MEASURES </p><p>APART FROM THE EARLIER SUGGESTION OF A PRISONER </p><p>EXCHANGE MIGHT BE CONSIDERED.  SUCH STEPS DIVIDE IN TWO </p><p>CATEGORIES, THOSE DIRECTLY IMPACTING SPLM CIVILIAN AND </p><p>MILITARY FIGURES; AND THOSE WHICH AFFECT POPULATIONS IN </p><p>THE SPLM-CONTROLLED AREAS AND ALSO IMPACT IN THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.  NOTING THAT BRAINSTORMING </p><p>WITH THE PAO HAD ADDED ELEMENTS, I CITED NOTIONS OF: </p><p> </p><p>-- KHARTOUM MEDIA ACCESS FOR SPLM/A LEADER GARANG TO </p><p>MAKE HIS CASE; </p><p>-- OFFERING SUDANESE PASSPORTS TO MAJOR SPLM FIGURES IN </p><p>NAIROBI, CAIRO, LONDON; </p><p>--  A PUBLIC STATEMENT BY PRESIDENT BASHIR RECOGNIZING </p><p>THE DAMAGE DONE, ESPECIALLY IN THE SOUTH, BY THE CIVIL </p><p>WAR AND THAT SOUTHERN GRIEVANCES ARE REAL AND MUST BE </p><p>SATISFIED. </p><p> </p><p>THE SECOND CATEGORY MAINLY FOCUSES ON RELIEF EFFORTS BY </p><p>THE UN OPERATION LIFELINE SUDAN (UN/OLS).  KHARTOUM </p><p>COULD: </p><p> </p><p>-- LIFT PROHIBITIONS ON FLIGHT TO 16 DESTINATIONS BY </p><p>OLS AND TO 12 DESTINATIONS BY ICRC; </p><p> </p><p>-- PERMIT OPERATION OVER SUDAN OF THE BELGIAN AIR </p><p>FORCE-PROVIDED C-130, PROHIBITED FROM SUDANESE AIRSPACE </p><p>SINCE MID-1995; </p><p> </p><p>-- OPEN THE CONTROVERSIAL NUBA MOUNTAIN AREA TO OLS </p><p>OPERATIONS, STARTING WITH AN ASSESSMENT MISSION AS </p><p>EARLY AS THE END OF MAY; </p><p> </p><p>-- CREATE, SUBJECT TO DISCUSSION WITH THE UN, A MIXED </p><p>GOS/SSIM/SPLA SECURITY ELEMENT FOR UN BARGE CONVOYS TO </p><p>PREVENT ANY LOOTING AS WELL AS TO ENSURE ONLY FOOD AND </p><p>RELIEF ITEMS ARE DELIVERED TO DESTINATIONS ALONG THE </p><p>NILE. </p><p> </p><p>TAHA TOOK THE AMBASSADOR\'S LIST OF POSSIBLE GESTURES, </p><p>SAYING THAT HE WOULD LOOK AT THE IDEAS WITH MILITARY </p><p>AND SECURITY STAFF, BUT SOME SEEM IMMEDIATELY </p><p>ACCEPTABLE. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  CONCLUDING THIS ASPECT OF THE DISCUSSION, THE </p><p>MINISTER ASKED THAT THE FOLLOWING MESSAGE BE CONVEYED </p><p>TO THE SPLM.  ANY SPLM IDEAS ON PEACE ARE WELCOME.  THE </p><p>SPLA MUST BE PART OF ANY PROCESS FOR COMPREHENSIVE </p><p>PEACE.  THE GOS HAS NO/NO HIDDEN AGENDA AND IS NOT/NOT </p><p>TRYING TO PLAY INSURGENT FACTIONS OFF AGAINST EACH </p><p>OTHER.  TAHA BELIEVES THAT IF GARANG COMES IN, PEACE </p><p>WILL MATERIALIZE.  THE GOS IS OPEN TO VENUE FOR TALKS </p><p>AND TO WHO WOULD BE PLAYERS IN ANY TALKS.  I SAID I HAD </p><p>ASKED THE SPLM TO ARRANGE A MEETING WITH GARANG ON MY </p><p>RETURN TO NAIROBI AND WOULD CONVEY TAHA\'S MESSAGE, </p><p>STRESSING THAT KHARTOUM SHOULD MAKE GESTURES SOON, </p><p>PERHAPS TIMING SOME TO THE OPENING OF THE 20 MAY </p><p>NETHERLANDS CONFERENCE ON HUMANITARIAN MATTERS WHICH IS </p><p>A FOLLOW-ON TO LAST SEPTEMBER\'S BARCELONA GATHERING </p><p>UNDER THE UNESCO "CULTURE OF PEACE" RUBRIC. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>POLICY ON TERRORISM </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  TAHA DISMISSED NOTETAKERS TO TALK ABOUT THE </p><p>PROCESS HE INITIATED DURING A 6 FEBRUARY MEETING WITH </p><p>THEN AF/E DIRECTOR SHINN AND MYSELF JUST BEFORE THE </p><p>U.S. DIPLOMATIC STAFF WITHDREW OFFSHORE.  I TOLD HIM </p><p>WASHINGTON CONTINUES SKEPTICAL, ALL THE MORE SO GIVEN </p><p>THE FAILURE OF KHARTOUM TO TAKE VERIFIABLE STEPS ON THE </p><p>ISSUE OF ITS HAVEN AND SUPPORT TO TERRORISTS.  CITING </p><p>THE PRESIDENT\'S 30 APRIL CREDENTIALS PRESENTATION </p><p>REMARKS TO THE NEW SUDANESE AMBASSADOR, I UNDERSCORED </p><p>THAT ACTIONS ARE NOW MORE IMPORTANT THAN DIALOGUE, </p><p>SAYING THAT A 45-90 DAY WINDOW IN TIME IS NOW OPEN </p><p>WITHIN WHICH THE GOS CAN DEMONSTRATE THAT ITS </p><p>INTENTIONS ARE REAL. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (S)  TAHA REPLIED THAT A DECISION TO FORCE </p><p>(TERRORIST) ORGANIZATIONS TO GO IS IN PROCESS.  HE </p><p>REFERRED TO SPECIFICS CONCERNING EGYPTIAN TERRORISTS, </p><p>SEEMING TO CONFIRM DIPLOMATIC SOURCES WHO TOLD ME THAT </p><p>A LIST OF 39 EGYPTIANS HAVE GONE AT SUDANESE REQUEST. </p><p>I STRESSED THE NEED TO VERIFY SUCH MATTERS WITH </p><p>INFORMATION ON PASSPORTS AND DESTINATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C)  IN DISCUSSING SPECIFICS, TAHA RAISED THE CASE </p><p>OF RENEGADE SAUDI FINANCIER USAMA BIN LADEN.  AN MFA </p><p>CONTACT HAD EARLIER TOLD ME THAT THE MFA WAS </p><p>INSTRUMENTAL IN GETTING BIN LADEN TO ACCEPT A TIME </p><p>MAGAZINE INTERVIEW (PUBLISHED IN THE 6 MAY EDITION). </p><p>TAHA MUSED ABOUT GETTING THE VARIOUS ORGANIZATIONS AND </p><p>INDIVIDUALS TO ENTER INTO CONTACTS WITH THE WEST AS </p><p>PART OF BRINGING THEM TO SEE MATTERS IN A DIFFERENT </p><p>WAY.  HE RECALLED THE CASE OF THE FOUNDER OF THE MUSLIM </p><p>BROTHERHOOD WHO HAD ENTERED INTO CONTACT WITH A BRITISH </p><p>GOVERNMENT ARABIST IN EGYPT IN THE 1940S.  NASSER HAD </p><p>CITED THE CONTACT TO DISCREDIT THE BROTHERHOOD IN HIS </p><p>1954 CONFLICT WITH THE ORGANIZATION, TAHA SAID, NOTING </p><p>THAT THE HISTORY ECHOES IN THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ISLAMIST </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS TO THIS DAY.  HE MOOTED PUTTING USAMA BIN </p><p>LADEN IN CONTACT WITH WESTERN EMBASSIES.  COMMENT: </p><p>WHILE I TOSSED MY BRITISH COLLEAGUE, A FINE ARABIST, </p><p>OUT OF THE TROIKA, I BELIEVE WE WOULD DO BETTER TO WORK </p><p>ON GETTING BIN LADEN INTO SAUDI HANDS THAN COUNTING ON </p><p>HIM TO CHANGE HIS STRIPES THROUGH DIALOGUE WITH </p><p>WESTERNERS. END COMMENT </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>REGION AND THE UNSCR </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C)  CLEARLY UNDER PRESSURE FROM THE INCREASINGLY </p><p>VOCIFEROUS NEW PARLIAMENT, TAHA BEGAN MORE OR LESS </p><p>THINKING OUT LOUD ON HOW TO DEAL WITH UNSCR 1054 AND </p><p>THE POOR STATE OF RELATIONS WITH NEIGHBORS ETHIOPIA AND </p><p>UGANDA.  HE ARGUED THAT NOW IS NOT THE MOMENT FOR SUDAN </p><p>TO DEAL DIRECTLY WITH THEM AS SUCH AN EFFORT WAS </p><p>UNLIKELY TO BE WELL-RECEIVED.  HE ASKED IF THE U.S. </p><p>COULD SOUND OUT POSSIBILITIES.  I REBUFFED THE NOTION, </p><p>TELLING TAHA THAT SUDAN HAS THE RESPONSIBILITY TO DO </p><p>SO, AND THAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES, NOTABLY THE TERRORISM </p><p>DIMENSION, MEAN THAT KHARTOUM MUST WORK DIRECTLY WITH </p><p>ADDIS, PRIMARILY, ALL THE MORE SO AS IT APPEARS GAMES </p><p>HAVE BEEN PLAYED WITH THE THREE SUSPECTS, NOW SEEMINGLY </p><p>OUT OF SUDAN. </p><p> </p><p>ASMARA MINIMIZE CONSIDERED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BRAZEAL </p><p></p></div>
