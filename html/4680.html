(C)  DRAWING ON POINTS REFTEL, POLOFF ON DECEMBER 11 </p><p>EMPHASIZED WITH GIOVANNI RICCIULI, DIRECTOR OF THE MFA\'S </p><p>OFFICE FOR MEDITERRANEAN AND SOUTHERN EUROPE ISSUES, THE </p><p>IMPORTANCE OF KEEPING THE PRESSURE ON ALL SIDES TO AGREE TO A </p><p>CYPRUS SETTLEMENT.  RICCIULI UNDERLINED THAT THE GOI SHARED </p><p>THE USG\'S SENSE OF URGENCY, AND IN FACT FM FRATTINI WOULD BE </p><p>MEETING WITH CYPRIOT FM IOANNIS KASOULIDES IN ROME THAT VERY </p><p>AFTERNOON.   (COMMENT: RICCIULI INTERRUPTED THE MEETING TO </p><p>ASK AN ASSISTANT TO HAND CARRY REFTEL POINTS TO FRATTINI\'S </p><p>STAFFERS SO THAT THEY COULD BE INCLUDED IN HIS BRIEFING </p><p>MATERIALS.) </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  RICCIULI SAID THAT THE DETAILED ANALYSIS PROVIDED </p><p>REFTEL WOULD PROVE VALUABLE DURING THE FRATTINI/KASOULIDES </p><p>MEETING AND IN DISCUSSIONS LEADING UP TO AND IN COPENHAGEN. </p><p>HOWEVER, HE CONTINUED, IF WE HOPED FOR A CYPRUS AGREEMENT IN </p><p>TIME FOR THE COPENHAGEN SUMMIT, ALL SIDES WOULD HAVE TO </p><p>CONCUR ON THE POLITICAL NECESSITY OF AN AGREEMENT; THE </p><p>"POLITICAL WILL" OF BOTH SIDES TO AGREE ON THE OVERALL </p><p>CONCEPT OF THE UN PROPOSAL IS NECESSARY.

RICCIULI SAID THAT FRATTINI KNOWS </p><p>THAT THE EU, U.S., AND UN MUST KEEP THE PRESSURE ON ALL SIDES. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  05939  111724Z </p><p>3.  (C) SANDRO DE BERNADIN, IN THE MFA\'S OFFICE OF EUROPEAN </p><p>INTEGRATION, TOLD POLOFF DECEMBER 11 THAT THE GOI CAME OUT OF </p><p>THE COPENHAGEN MINISTERIAL "HOPEFUL" THAT ENOUGH PROGRESS </p><p>COULD BE MADE ON ESDP AND BERLIN-PLUS IN THE COMING MONTHS SO </p><p>THAT EUROPE COULD "HONOR ITS DECLARED COMMITMENTS" TO HELP </p><p>STABILIZE MACEDONIA.  THIS COULD NOT BE DONE WITHOUT </p><p>AGREEMENT ON BERLIN-PLUS, AND ITALY SHARES THE BRITISH VIEW </p><p>THAT AD-HOC ARRANGEMENTS OR BERLIN-PLUS "WORK AROUNDS" ARE </p><p>UNACCEPTABLE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  ACCORDING TO DE BERNADIN, MOST MINISTERS AT THE </p><p>GAERC WERE SUPPORTIVE OF HIGH REP SOLANA\'S IDEA TO LINK </p><p>BERLIN-PLUS TO ONLY THOSE COUNTRIES PARTICIPATING IN </p><p>PARTNERSHIP FOR PEACE.  THE PROPOSAL CAUGHT GREEK FM </p><p>PAPANDREOU OFF GUARD, HE SAID, BUT THE GOI WAS HOPEFUL THAT </p><p>THE PROPOSAL ANSWERED GREEK CONCERNS.  THE GOI WOULD WORK </p><p>HARD AT COPENHAGEN TO DE-LINK THE ESDP AND TURKEY ACCESSION </p><p>ISSUES, DESPITE GERMAN FEELINGS TO THE CONTRARY. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME05939 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
