Reasons 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary:  After a reported exchange of fire on </p><p>March 10, the Sri Lanka Navy sunk a cargo ship, that the </p><p>Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) claimed was one </p><p>of its merchant ships.  While the monitoring mission </p><p>investigates the incident, the Norwegian Embassy and </p><p>others have expressed concerns about the effect of the </p><p>incident on the peace talks.  Despite the concerns, most </p><p>observers believe that talks will continue.  End Summary </p><p> </p><p>Conflicting GSL and LTTE reports on incident </p><p>============================================ </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) According to Sri Lanka Navy reports (detailed in </p><p>Ref A), the navy intercepted a LTTE arms supply ship </p><p>approximately 180 nautical miles (207 miles) off the </p><p>coast of Mullativu (on the north eastern coast of Sri </p><p>Lanka).  The navy then reports that after it ordered the </p><p>ship to stop, the cargo ship\'s crewmembers opened fire. </p><p>In defending itself, the naval ship returned fire and </p><p>sunk the LTTE vessel. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) The "TamilNet" website, believed to be </p><p>controlled by the LTTE, reports that the Sri Lanka Navy </p><p>attacked a LTTE merchant vessel 220 nautical miles </p><p>(about 250 miles) off the eastern coast.  It also </p><p>reports that LTTE political wing leader Thamilchelvan </p><p>sent a letter to the Minister of Defense condemning the </p><p>sinking of the ship.  The report added that </p><p>Thamilchelvan stated that the "grave incident will have </p><p>far reaching implications for the peace process."  The </p><p>LTTE accuses the Sri Lanka Navy of being involved in </p><p>several deliberate and provocative attacks against the </p><p>LTTE in violation of the ceasefire agreement. </p><p> </p><p>SLMM and others express concern </p><p>=============================== </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) When questioned, the Norwegian led Sri Lanka </p><p>Monitoring Mission (SLMM) spokesman Teitur Torkelson </p><p>commented that the SLMM was still investigating the </p><p>incident and does not expect to make a public statement </p><p>until March 13.  A concern that the SLMM has is that </p><p>initial navy reports place the incident approximately </p><p>240 nautical miles (276 miles) off the coast and in </p><p>international waters, while the navy\'s final written </p><p>report places the incident at approximately 180 nautical </p><p>miles off the coast.  The shortened distance puts the </p><p>incident within the area that Sri Lanka claims as its </p><p>exclusive economic zone.  Torkelson added that even if </p><p>the incident took place in international waters the navy </p><p>had certain rights in regards to "hot pursuit" or </p><p>"defense" type issues that had to be reviewed.  One of </p><p>the SLMM tasks is to try to determine the precise </p><p>location of the incident. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Tomas Stangeland, political officer at the </p><p>Norwegian Embassy, expressed concern about the </p><p>repercussions the incident may have on the next round of </p><p>talks.  He stated that although the Norwegians have not </p><p>heard anything from the LTTE as of yet, he expects the </p><p>LTTE will contact them with comments after the SLMM </p><p>releases its report.  Stangeland believes that the </p><p>incident will lead to some recriminations by the LTTE </p><p>against the GSL, but that the sixth round of talks will </p><p>proceed. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Other observers seem to be of the consensus that, </p><p>although the incident increases tensions, both sides are </p><p>still committed to the peace process.  For example </p><p>Joseph Pararajasingham, a senior Tamil United Liberation </p><p>Front (TULF) MP, commented to the DCM that sinking of </p><p>the ship does increase tensions, but the LTTE is </p><p>concerned with its image in the international community </p><p>and wants to be seen as being fully committed to the </p><p>peace process.  Therefore, the LTTE will continue with </p><p>the talks until forced to defend itself.  Another TULF </p><p>MP V. Anandasangaree told Poloff that incidents such as </p><p>these decrease the confidence that both sides have in </p><p>one another.  He concluded, however, that despite the </p><p>increased mistrust both sides are benefiting from the </p><p>ceasefire and are thus committed to the peace talks. </p><p>Jehan Perera, of the National Peace Council, a well- </p><p>respected local NGO, also believes that the talks will </p><p>continue.  He is concerned, though, that if the series </p><p>of recent incidents continue they will eventually take </p><p>their toll on the negotiations. </p><p>Comment </p><p>======= </p><p>7. (C) The sinking of the LTTE ship by the GSL has </p><p>clearly raised tensions between the two sides.  Adding </p><p>to the tensions are some unconfirmed reports that the </p><p>President ordered the navy to sink the LTTE ship -- the </p><p>navy is denying the report.  How the negotiators will </p><p>deal with these tensions in the next round of talks </p><p>remains to be seen.  The only positive outcome is the </p><p>general consensus that the talks will continue.  On a </p><p>separate note, one unusual aspect of the most recent </p><p>incident is the relatively muted response in the Tamil </p><p>community.  After other recent incidents the LTTE </p><p>responded immediately and vociferously with protests, </p><p>hartals (boycotts), and multiple complaints to and about </p><p>the government.  This time Thamilchelvan\'s letter </p><p>appears to be the principal response, for now.  End </p><p>Comment. </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
