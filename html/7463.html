<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 002467 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/15/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKISH KURDS: OVERJOYED BY END OF SADDAM </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Political Counselor John Kunstadter. </p><p>Reason:1.5(b)(d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) In April 15 discussions about the situation in Iraq, a </p><p>leading Kurdish political activist from Turkey\'s Southeast </p><p>and two business associates offered enthusiastic </p><p>congratulations to the USG for the Coalition\'s success </p><p>against the Saddam regime.  According to these Kurds: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Turkey did the USG a favor by not passing the March 1 </p><p>resolution that would have allowed deployment of U.S. and </p><p>Turkish troops to N. Iraq.  If the resolution had passed, </p><p>they said, the Turks would have entered N. Iraq "and it would </p><p>have been a disaster" for the USG and the region.  Turkey is </p><p>now in a bind; the key to getting the Turks to play ball is </p><p>to maintain the pressure on them -- not to accede to their </p><p>demands. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Their relatives in Syria are "ecstatic, too."  "If only </p><p>the Americans will drop bombs on us and get rid of Assad," </p><p>their relatives say.  "When are the U.S. troops going to </p><p>come?" they say their relatives are asking. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- The Turkish State is making it difficult for Turkish Kurds </p><p>to do business in N. Iraq or participate in reconstruction. </p><p>They said they can conclude construction deals with Barzani </p><p>but the deals won\'t become a reality without GOT support. </p><p>The Turkish State is trying to push Turkey\'s Kurdish </p><p>businessmen into the arms of "Turkmen companies."  Otherwise, </p><p>the Turkish authorities deny permission to do anything: "we </p><p>get blocked...unless we associate with an American partner." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Turkish intellectuals, whether "secularist" or Islamist, </p><p>are blinded by ideology, lack of information, and hostile to </p><p>USG regional interests.  As a result, most Turkish press </p><p>commentators and others got it completely wrong on Iraq and </p><p>ignored signs of the Iraqi people\'s distaste for Saddam. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) We have heard similar congratulation to the Coalition </p><p>and expressions of frustration at all forms of </p><p>authoritarianism in the region, including the Turkish State </p><p>in their view, from other Turkish Kurds.  For instance, </p><p>senior members of the now-banned HADEP expressed strong </p><p>support for USG regional efforts in an April 10 meeting with </p><p>us.  A scholarly, Kurdish-origin (Zaza) imam from Gaziantep </p><p>who has sharply criticized the damage to Islam from radical </p><p>Islamists and demonstrated great tolerance for Christianity </p><p>and Judaism in his remarks to us, commented on the identical </p><p>nature of Kemalism and Leninism in an April 13 conversation </p><p>and thought it would have been liberating for Turkey "if the </p><p>U.S. had directed a couple of cruise missiles onto Ataturk\'s </p><p>mausoleum." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>Comment: Turks "Doan Wahnt Nobody Nobody Sent" </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Like Chicago\'s legendary political machine, the </p><p>Turkish State machine is careful about whom it deals with. </p><p>An interesting angle will thus be the selection of winners in </p><p>the eventual wheeling and dealing on (sub)contracts that will </p><p>be part of any Turkish effort to participate in Iraq </p><p>reconstruction.  Given the Turkish State\'s abiding suspicions </p><p>about Kurdish aspirations in Turkey and N. Iraq, we think the </p><p>rate at which Kurdish contractors participate will be a </p><p>useful barometer of the State\'s plans for Turkey\'s Southeast. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
