SUMMARY.  THE UN FOOD AND AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATION </p><p>(FAO) SECRETARIAT HAS TENTATIVELY SCHEDULED THE EXPERT </p><p>GROUP MEETING ON THE MATERIAL TRANSFER AGREEMENT FOR THE </p><p>TREATY ON PLANT GENETIC RESOURCES (THE TREATY) FOR </p><p>OCTOBER 2003.  THE SECRETARIAT HOPES (BUT HAS NO </p><p>ASSURANCES) THAT DONORS WILL COME UP WITH THE USD 321,250 </p><p>STILL NEEDED TO HOST THE MEETING.  IN ORDER TO GENERATE </p><p>FUNDS FOR THE MEETING AND FOR THE OTHER PREPARATORY WORK </p><p>THAT MUST BE DONE, THE FAO HAS ISSUED AN APPEAL FOR </p><p>CONTRIBUTIONS TO A MULTI-DONOR TRUST FUND.   ACCORDING TO </p><p>THE SECRETARIAT, THE EUROPEAN UNION EXPECTS THAT ALL </p><p>MEMBERS WILL HAVE RATIFIED BY THE END OF 2003, AT WHICH </p><p>POINT THE TREATY WILL BE SIX RATIFICATIONS SHORT OF ENTRY </p><p>INTO FORCE.  THE RAPID PACE OF RATIFICATION RAISES THE </p><p>POSSIBILITY THAT THE TREATY WILL ENTER INTO FORCE BEFORE </p><p>THE INTERIM COMMITTEE HAS COMPLETED WORK ON THE DRAFT </p><p>MATERIAL TRANSFER AGREEMENT (MTA), THE DRAFT RULES OF </p><p>PROCEDURE AND FINANCIAL RULES AND COMPLIANCE.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  AT THE FIRST MEETING (REFTEL) OF THE FAO INTERIM </p><p>COMMITTEE FOR THE TREATY, COMMITTEE MEMBERS AGREED ON A </p><p>PLAN FOR WORK WHICH WOULD NEED TO BE COMPLETED PRIOR TO </p><p>THE FIRST MEETING OF THE TREATY\'S GOVERNING BODY. THE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  02210  01 OF 02  191114Z </p><p>WORK PLAN INCLUDES: AN EXPERT GROUP MEETING ON </p><p>PREPARATION OF A DRAFT MATERIAL TRANSFER AGREEMENT AND A </p><p>WORKING GROUP MEETING ON DRAFT FINANCIAL RULES, RULES OF </p><p>PROCEDURE AND COMPLIANCE. </p><p> </p><p>3. THERE IS NO FUNDING IN FAO\'S REGULAR BUDGET FOR THESE </p><p>ACTIVITIES; ABSENT VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTIONS THEY WILL </p><p>NOT/NOT TAKE PLACE.  SHOULD THE INTERIM COMMITTEE MEET </p><p>BEFORE THE NEXT REGULARLY SCHEDULED SESSION OF THE </p><p>COMMISSION ON GENETIC RESOURCES, FUNDING WOULD BE </p><p>REQUIRED FOR THAT SESSION AS WELL. </p><p> </p><p>4.  FAO HAS PREPARED A "MULTI-DONOR TRUST FUND" PROPOSAL </p><p>(COVER LETTER PROVIDED BELOW; COMPLETE PROPOSAL FAXED TO </p><p>OES RICK DRISCOLL 4/29/03) WHICH OUTLINES THE FINANCIAL </p><p>REQUIREMENTS FOR THE EXPERT GROUP AND WORKING GROUP </p><p>MEETINGS, A MEETING OF THE INTERIM COMMITTEE AND </p><p>SECRETARIAT SUPPORT.  THE OVERALL ESTIMATE IS USD </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>2,886,965 OVER 2003-2004.  OF MOST IMMEDIATE INTEREST IS </p><p>THE EXPERT GROUP FOR THE MTA WHICH IS COSTED AT USD </p><p>378,250 (USD 228,250 FOR SERVICING THE MEETING; USD </p><p>150,000 FOR TRAVEL OF EXPERTS AND ADVISERS FROM </p><p>DEVELOPING COUNTRIES AND COUNTRIES WITH ECONOMIES IN </p><p>TRANSITION.) </p><p> </p><p>MTA EXPERT GROUP -- CURRENT STATE OF PLAY </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  MISOFF MET WITH CLIVE STANNARD, SENIOR LIAISON </p><p>OFFICER IN FAO\'S AGRICULTURE DEPARTMENT MAY 15, 2003 TO </p><p>DISCUSS THE FUNDING SITUATION.  THE SECRETARIAT CURRENTLY </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  02210  01 OF 02  191114Z </p><p>HAS ABOUT USD 57,000 FOR THE MTA EXPERT GROUP.  FUNDS ARE </p><p>AVAILABLE FROM CANADA (USD 21,00), SPAIN (USD 9,000) AND </p><p>FROM LEFTOVER FUNDS FROM DONORS FOR OTHER ACTIVITIES. </p><p>STANNARD SAID THAT WAS NO CHANCE OF HOLDING THE MTA </p><p>MEETING BEFORE AUGUST; THEY HAVE TENTATIVELY SET THE DATE </p><p>FOR OCTOBER, WITH THE WORKING GROUP ON RULES OF </p><p>PROCEDURE, FINANCIAL RULES AND COMPLIANCE TENTATIVELY </p><p>SCHEDULED FOR NOVEMBER 2003. </p><p> </p><p>EARLY ENTRY INTO FORCE OF TREATY? </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  STANNARD ALSO INFORMED MISOFF THAT THE EU EXPECTED </p><p>THAT MEMBER STATE RATIFICATIONS WOULD BE COMPLETE BY THE </p><p>END OF 2003, WHICH WOULD BRING THE NUMBER OF </p><p>RATIFICATIONS 6 SHORT OF THE FORTY REQUIRED TO BRING THE </p><p>TREATY INTO FORCE.  SHOULD THE TREATY COME INTO FORCE </p><p>WITH WORK ON THE MTA, FINANCIAL RULES, RULES OF PROCEDURE </p><p>AND COMPLIANCE STILL UNFINISHED, PARTIES TO THE TREATY </p><p>WOULD NEED TO DECIDE HOW TO PROCEED.  STANNARD SUGGESTED </p><p>THAT ONE POSSIBILITY WOULD BE FOR THE INTERIM COMMITTEE </p><p>TO BE TRANSFORMED INTO A PREPARATORY COMMITTEE, WHICH </p><p>WOULD THEN FINISH THE WORK NECESSARY BEFORE THE FIRST </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ4759 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  02210  02 OF 02  191114Z </p><p>ACTION OES-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AF-00    AID-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00  COME-00  CTME-00 </p><p>      INL-00   DODE-00  ITCE-00  WHA-00   SRPP-00  EB-00    EXME-00 </p><p>      EUR-00   E-00     UTED-00  FDRE-01  VC-00    FRB-00   TEDE-00 </p><p>      INR-00   IO-00    ITC-01   LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01 </p><p>      NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  CAEX-00  PER-00 </p><p>      ACE-00   STR-00   TEST-00  TRSE-00  USIE-00  DRL-01   G-00 </p><p>      SAS-00     /010W </p><p>                  ------------------673FB1  191115Z /38 </p><p>R 191112Z MAY 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 9992 </p><p>USDA FAS WASHDC 2675 </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p>AMEMBASSY MEXICO </p><p>USEU BRUSSELS 3237 </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 02 ROME 002210 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR OES/ENV RICK DRISCOLL, IO/EDA KOTOK </p><p>USDA FOR HEGWOOD, USDA/FAS FOR REICH AND HUGHES, USDA/ARS </p><p>FOR JUNE BLALOCK AND PETER BRETTING </p><p>USAID FOR ROB BERTRAM </p><p>MEXICO CITY FOR BRAKEL </p><p>NAIROBI FOR UNEP </p><p> </p><p>FROM FODAG </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  02210  02 OF 02  191114Z </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS:  EAGR, AORC, FAO, </p><p>SUBJECT: FUNDING REQUEST: FAO TREATY ON GENETIC RESOURCES </p><p> </p><p>MEETING OF THE GOVERNING BODY. </p><p> </p><p>FAO PROPOSAL FOR MULTI-DONOR TRUST FUND </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.
