(SBU) Water Sector Reconstruction Plan -- The Dutch </p><p>water industry (aka </p><p>Netherlands Water Partnership) drafted a plan for the </p><p>reconstruction of Iraq\'s </p><p>water sector.  It is a comprehensive strategy that covers </p><p>drinking water, </p><p>sanitation, irrigation, marshlands, and water transport.  It </p><p>also features a </p><p>list of technical experts.  The Dutch submitted this to the </p><p>World Bank, and </p><p>post forwarded the plan to ORHA/CPA via EUR.  Post would be </p><p>happy to resend an </p><p>electronic copy of this plan to any interested parties.

The consultants will perform a </p><p>needs assessment </p><p>and will identify potential projects in the areas of water </p><p>management, ports, </p><p>telecom, and the medical sector.
