<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 05 ADANA 0028 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINS, PGOV, PHUM, TU, IZ, ADANA, Press Summaries </p><p>SUBJECT:  SOUTHEAST TURKEY PRESS SUMMARY, </p><p>          JANUARY 27, 2003 </p><p> </p><p>1.  This is the Southeastern Turkey press summary </p><p>for January 27, 2003.  Please note that Turkish </p><p>press reports often contain errors or exaggerations; </p><p>AmConsulate Adana does not vouch for the accuracy of </p><p>the reports summarized here. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>POLITICS, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  DIGITALLY EQUIPPED U.S. TROOPS TO NORTHERN FRONT </p><p>(Milliyet)  If the Turkish Parliament grants </p><p>permission, 30,000 soldiers of the U.S. Fourth </p><p>Infantry Division, the first digitally-equipped unit </p><p>of the U.S. army, could enter Iraq through Sirnak\'s </p><p>Habur border gate within days.  The division is made </p><p>up of three infantry, one airborne, and one </p><p>engineering brigade.  Airborne units have Apache and </p><p>Comanche helicopters, while land units have M1A </p><p>Abrams tanks and Bradley armored vehicles.  The </p><p>division, led by Major-General Raymond T. Odierno, </p><p>has a rich history. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  CONTINUED ANTI-WAR SENTIMENTS </p><p>Evrensel reported nationwide anti-war protests </p><p>against U.S. preparations to hit Iraq.  Thousands of </p><p>people participated in these protests held in Mus, </p><p>Batman, Bingol, Hatay, Amasya, and Sivas.  Ahmet </p><p>Tas, President of the Cukurova (Adana) Handicapped </p><p>People\'s Association, expressed opposition to the </p><p>possible U.S. operation against Iraq.  "We do not </p><p>want to see war-stricken people in Turkey and the </p><p>world," he added.  Turkiye quoted Kilis Governor </p><p>Aslan Kutuk as announcing having taken all kinds of </p><p>measures against a possible influx of refugees from </p><p>Iraq, as well as chemical, biological, and nuclear </p><p>attacks.  In Hakkari, the Civil Defense Directorate </p><p>has provided 145 personnel with two-month training </p><p>on nuclear weapons that might be used in a possible </p><p>war.  Gaziantep-based Sanko Holding Company </p><p>President Abdulkadir Konukoglu said he sided with </p><p>peace and did not even want to articulate the word </p><p>"war."  In addition, "health tourism" from Iraq has </p><p>declined almost to zero due to war rumors.  Nearly </p><p>100 Iraqis had been given medical services in </p><p>Gaziantep, to which no Iraqis came over the past two </p><p>months.  Asim Guzelbey of the Abdulkadir Konukoglu </p><p>Medical Center said that under a protocol agreement </p><p>signed between his hospital and the Olimpik Hospital </p><p>in Baghdad, Turkish doctors and health teams had </p><p>from time to time served in Iraq.  He added that he </p><p>had to cancel a January 22 trip to Baghdad due to </p><p>these rumors.  Mersin Industrialists and </p><p>Businessmen\'s Association (MESIAD) President Musa </p><p>Timur opposed a possible war against Iraq because it </p><p>would substantially affect the provincial economy. </p><p>"Bombs dropped during the 1991 Gulf Crisis fell on </p><p>Mersin as economic bombs," he reacted.  Milli Gazete </p><p>cited Felicity Party (SP) Elazig Provincial Women\'s </p><p>Commission President Nazan Atasci as saying "We have </p><p>no children to send to the front."  Atasci </p><p>characterized the possible war in Iraq as a dirty </p><p>game of American imperialism and its search for </p><p>hegemony.  "It is not possible for those who for </p><p>many years terrorized others, formed terrorist </p><p>organizations, and fed terrorists to fight against </p><p>terrorism," she added.  Bolge quoted the Grand Unity </p><p>Party (BBP) National Vice President, Turan Guven, as </p><p>saying that "northern Iraq is too important for </p><p>Turkey to be left to its own fate."  The Diyarbakir </p><p>Labor Platform issued a press release against war. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  HUNGER STRIKES </p><p>Evrensel reported continued protest demonstrations </p><p>in many provinces against the isolation of jailed </p><p>PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan and possible U.S.-led </p><p>war.  Twenty members of the Prisoners and Inmates </p><p>Families Initiative started a six-day rotating </p><p>hunger strike at the Democratic People\'s Party </p><p>(DEHAP) Kayapinar (Diyarbakir) office.  In Siirt, </p><p>twelve relatives of inmates told the HADEP </p><p>provincial organization that they had launched a </p><p>two-day rotating hunger strike to protest isolation </p><p>conditions in prisons.  A pro-Ocalan protest was </p><p>also held in Mersin. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  NINE HIZBULLAH SUSPECTS ARRESTED IN MALATYA </p><p>(Cumhuriyet/Turkiye)  According to the Malatya </p><p>Security Directorate, police arrested nine people, a </p><p>woman among them, for providing support and shelter </p><p>to Hizbullah members who had taken part in the 2001 </p><p>assassination of former Diyarbakir Security Director </p><p>Gaffar Okkan.  The arrestees were accused of </p><p>bringing the Hizbullah gunmen to Elazig and placing </p><p>them in a Hizbullah safe house there </p><p>A pistol, a cartridge clip, six cartridges, as well </p><p>as false ID cards, false passports, and </p><p>organizational documents, were also confiscated. </p><p>Officials determined that the arrestees had been </p><p>trying to establish Hizbullah safe houses in Ankara, </p><p>Istanbul, Elazig, and Malatya, carrying out </p><p>organizational activities in mosques and schools, </p><p>extorting money and raising funds for the </p><p>organization.  One of the arrestees had also been </p><p>involved in the killing of a police officer in </p><p>Elazig and preparing to travel abroad. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  HADEP MAYOR ATTEMPTS TO DEMOLISH DIYARBAKIR </p><p>MONUMENT </p><p>(Hurriyet)  Remzi Azizoglu, HADEP Mayor of </p><p>Diyarbakir\'s Yenisehir central district </p><p>Municipality, wanted to demolish that district\'s </p><p>Sehitler Aniti (Monument of Martyrs), in line with a </p><p>decision made by his municipal council.  The State </p><p>of Emergency (OHAL) regional governor\'s office had </p><p>constructed the monument in Diyarakir in </p><p>commemoration of soldiers and security officers </p><p>killed during the Anti-Terror Struggle in the </p><p>region.  The Diyarbakir Governor\'s Office blocked </p><p>the mayor\'s demolition plans. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  MILITARY VEHICLE OVERTURNS IN RURAL HAKKARI </p><p>(Turkiye)  A military vehicle carrying foodstuffs </p><p>for Jandarma stations along the Iranian border </p><p>overturned in Yuksekova (Hakkari) on January 26. </p><p>One NCO was killed and five soldiers were injured </p><p>during the incident. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  TEN DEHAP/HADEP MEMBERS HELD </p><p>(Turkiye/Evrensel)  A Van court ordered ten </p><p>Democratic People\'s Party (DEHAP)/People\'s Democracy </p><p>Party (HADEP) members to remain in custody for </p><p>violation of the Demonstrations and Marches Law. </p><p>They were among 80 people, including women, who had </p><p>been arrested for faxing messages to the Justice </p><p>Ministry protesting the possible U.S. operation </p><p>against Iraq and the isolation of jailed PKK leader </p><p>Abdullah Ocalan. </p><p>9.  ATTEMPTED BOMB ATTACK BY FORMER VILLAGE </p><p>(Evrensel)  Former village guard Zubeyir Kamal, who </p><p>had three hand grenades on him, came to the Siirt </p><p>Courthouse and threatened to pull the grenades\' pins </p><p>unless he was allowed to meet with the chief </p><p>prosecutor.  While police officers were trying to </p><p>calm him down, several plain-clothes officers seized </p><p>the grenades.  Kamal had been hired as a village </p><p>guard in 1991, but his labor contract was terminated </p><p>in 2001. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  MISSING SILOPI (SIRNAK) HADEP OFFICIALS </p><p>(Evrensel)  Three years have passed since the </p><p>disappearance of People\'s Democracy Party (HADEP) </p><p>Silopi (Sirnak) district President Serdar Tanis and </p><p>HADEP official Ebubekir Deniz in January 2000.  No </p><p>information has been obtained about them since then. </p><p>No progress has been made with regard to lawsuits </p><p>opened by their families, who claim the assailants </p><p>are known and call on the public to support for the </p><p>case. </p><p>11.  INVESTIGATION AGAINST TUNCELI JANDARMA </p><p>(Evrensel)  The Erzincan Felony Court reversed a </p><p>decision by the Pertek (Tunceli) Prosecutor\'s </p><p>Office.  The Prosecutor\'s Office had concluded that </p><p>there were no grounds for proceeding with an </p><p>investigation launched against the Pertek Jandarma </p><p>for the destruction of graves of two youths in a </p><p>local village.  The court sent back the file to the </p><p>Prosecutor\'s Office and ordered the initiation of an </p><p>investigation against the Jandarma. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  ADANA AGRICULTURAL DIRECTOR SHOT </p><p>(Turkiye)  Police officer Mustafa Akinci, together </p><p>with his brother Kerim Akinci, shot Adana </p><p>Agricultural Director Fikret Coskun twice in the leg </p><p>in his office on January 26.  Coskun had made a </p><p>decision to transfer Mustafa\'s wife, an employee of </p><p>the directorate, to another province due to a work- </p><p>related problem.  The Akinci brothers shot Coskun </p><p>when they failed to convince him to withdraw his </p><p>decision.  The brothers were arrested by police </p><p>officers, while Coskun was hospitalized.  In his </p><p>testimony, Coskun reportedly said he did not know </p><p>his assailants and why had been shot.  Meanwhile, </p><p>Milli Gazete and Bolge reported that in fact Coskun </p><p>had shot himself while cleaning his pistol. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13.  "CHANGING FACE OF SOUTHEASTERN TURKEY" </p><p>(Turkiye/Milli Gazete)  In Siverek\'s (Sanliurfa) </p><p>Karakeci village, which is home to 15,000 members of </p><p>the district\'s major clans, families have </p><p>traditionally requested dowries ranging from TL 20 </p><p>billion to 30 billion (approx. USD 12,000-18,000) </p><p>and kilograms of gold in return for their daughters </p><p>eligible for marriage.  Today, however, families </p><p>look for such qualities as college degree in </p><p>prospective sons-in-law.  In the village, university </p><p>graduates can marry young women without having to </p><p>pay dowries. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14.  SHORTAGE OF MEDICAL PERSONNEL AND TEACHERS IN </p><p>SEVERAL SE PROVINCES </p><p>(Evrensel)  Health services at the Mus State </p><p>Hospital are stalling due to a shortage of medical </p><p>personnel.  The Hospital\'s Senior Physician, Dr. </p><p>Mustafa Ates, said ten specialist physicians, ten </p><p>general-practice physicians, and 54 nurses served at </p><p>the 300-bed hospital.  Ates stressed the need for </p><p>another 50 physicians, including 20 specialists, and </p><p>250 nurses.  In Tunceli\'s only state hospital, there </p><p>are only five expert physicians specializing in </p><p>internal diseases, general surgery, and gynecology, </p><p>maternity, and pediatrics.  That is, one specialist </p><p>serves 20,000 patients.  The Bingol Maternity and </p><p>Pediatrics Hospital\'s computer-assisted Intensive </p><p>Care Center is not operational due to a lack of </p><p>qualified personnel.  In addition, the Siverek </p><p>(Sanliurfa) National Education Directorate said </p><p>there was a shortage of teachers in all branches </p><p>across the district.  Parents called for the </p><p>appointment of new teachers for these vacancies. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15.  POSSIBLE WATER-BORN DISEASES IN MARDIN </p><p>(Turkiye)  In Nusaybin (Mardin), many State Water </p><p>Works (DSI) officials were hospitalized after they </p><p>had been "poisoned" by drinking water with which </p><p>sewage had mixed.  DSI officials carried out an </p><p>analysis on a sample of the water coming from a 135- </p><p>meter-deep well and found out that it was </p><p>contaminated. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16.  TWO HUNDRED KILOS OF HASHISH SEIZED </p><p>(Turkiye)  Syrian officials stopped a vehicle </p><p>carrying three Turkish citizens at Syria\'s El Saleme </p><p>border gate.  During the search of the vehicle, the </p><p>officials confiscated 200 kilograms of hashish and </p><p>arrested the three.  An investigation is underway to </p><p>look into possible contacts in Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ECONOMIC AND AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENTS </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>17.  STATE MINISTER TUZMEN IN GAZIANTEP </p><p>(Turkiye)  State Minister Kursat Tuzmen attended a </p><p>celebration in Gaziantep to mark the 50th </p><p>anniversary of the World Customs Day on January 26. </p><p>In his speech, Tuzmen said he was planning to </p><p>establish border trade centers and improve trade to </p><p>the benefit of countries involved in it.  "When our </p><p>commercial ties with our neighbors have increased, </p><p>this will create an excellent political platform, </p><p>leading to permanent commercial and political </p><p>relations.  Instead of being engaged in other things </p><p>and spending huge amounts of money on security by </p><p>purchasing weapons, this region will ensure its own </p><p>development.  It will allocate money for health, </p><p>education, research, and development," Tuzmen added. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>18.  ADANA-MALATYA RAILWAY SERVICES ON HOLD </p><p>Evrensel reported that railway services between </p><p>Adana and Malatya provinces have been suspended for </p><p>the past eight months due to negligence on the part </p><p>of the Turkish State Railways Administration (TCDD). </p><p>The newspaper criticized TCDD for failing to repair </p><p>a damaged tunnel, which eventually resulted in the </p><p>tunnel\'s closure. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>19.  TURKISH GREEN CARDS </p><p>(Turkiye)  Necmi Kurt, President of the Social </p><p>Assistance and Solidarity Foundation, an affiliate </p><p>of the Tarsus district Governor\'s Office, announced </p><p>having issued Turkish green cards for 19,864 of the </p><p>22,652 applicants in 2002.  These cards are issued </p><p>to low-income families who cannot afford to pay for </p><p>medical services, to make use of medical services at </p><p>State-run hospital free of charge. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HOLTZ </p><p></p></div>
