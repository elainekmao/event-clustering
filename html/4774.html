REASON:1.5 </p><p>(B)(D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  SUMMARY: ON DECEMBER 17, MFA DIRECTOR GENERAL FOR </p><p>EUROPEAN INTEGRATION ROCCO CANGELOSI TOLD POLITICAL </p><p>MINISTER-COUNSELOR TOM COUNTRYMAN THAT THE GOI WAS, IN </p><p>GENERAL, PLEASED WITH THE RESULTS IN COPENHAGEN.  WHILE </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THE DECISION ON TURKEY COULD HAVE BEEN </p><p>MORE POSITIVE, HE FOCUSED ON THE NEED TO KEEP THE PRESSURE ON </p><p>TURKEY TO CONTINUE WITH REFORMS AND BE MORE COOPERATIVE ON </p><p>CYPRUS.  CANGELOSI\'S RESPONSIBILITIES INCLUDE MFA </p><p>PREPARATIONS FOR THE ITALIAN EU PRESIDENCY BEGINNING JULY </p><p>2003, AND HE PROVIDED AN OUTLINE OF GOI PRIORITIES.  FM </p><p>FRATTINI TOLD PARLIAMENT THAT THE LANGUAGE ON TURKEY WAS AN </p><p>"ACCEPTABLE COMPROMISE," PAVING THE WAY FOR TURKISH AGREEMENT </p><p>ON ESDP COOPERATION WITH NATO, AND CONFIRMED THE ITALIAN AND </p><p>GREEK PRESIDENCIES WOULD REFOCUS EU ATTENTION ON BALKAN AND </p><p>MED ISSUES.  FRATTINI SAID THAT THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF </p><p>ENLARGEMENT WOULD OUTWEIGH THE COSTS. END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  CANGELOSI EMPHASIZED THE HISTORICAL IMPORT OF THE </p><p>DECISION TAKEN IN COPENHAGEN TO ENLARGE THE EU TO 25 MEMBERS </p><p>ON MAY 1, 2004.  WHILE THE NEW MEMBERS WILL OF COURSE REQUIRE </p><p>AN "INTEGRATION PERIOD," THE PROCESS FOR THE 10 IS </p><p>IRREVERSIBLE AND HE PREDICTED THAT THERE WOULD BE "NO </p><p>SURPRISES" WITH ANY REQUIRED REFERENDA. ENLARGEMENT WILL </p><p>INCREASE STABILITY AND BOOST THE INTERNAL EUROPEAN MARKET; IT </p><p>ALSO MEANS THAT THE EU MUST REFORM ITS INSTITUTIONS.  IT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  06037  01 OF 02  181431Z </p><p>CANNOT OPERATE AT 25 AS IT DID AT 15.  REFORMS TO INCLUDE </p><p>QUALIFIED MAJORITY VOTING AND AMENDING THE SIX-MONTH ROTATING </p><p>PRESIDENCY WOULD BE NECESSARY, AND IT WILL BE UP TO THE GREEK </p><p>AND ITALIAN PRESIDENCIES TO DO THEIR PART TO PUSH THE REFORMS </p><p>THROUGH.  CANGELOSI DESCRIBED THE REQUIRED REFORMS AS </p><p>EVOLUTION, NOT REVOLUTION; ADJUSTMENTS, NOT DEEP CHANGES. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  IN RESPONSE TO POLMIN\'S APPRECIATION FOR THE GOI\'S </p><p>STRONG SUPPORT FOR AN ACCESSION DATE FOR TURKEY, CANGELOSI </p><p>ASSERTED THAT IF NOT FOR PMS BERLUSCONI AND BLAIR\'S </p><p>INTERVENTION, THE SUMMIT STATEMENT WOULD HAVE BEEN EVEN LESS </p><p>FORWARD-LEANING ON TURKEY\'S EU ASPIRATIONS.  TURKEY SHOULD </p><p>LOOK UPON COPENHAGEN AS A VICTORY.  WE MUST NOW KEEP THE </p><p>PRESSURE ON TURKEY TO IMPLEMENT LEGISLATION AND KEEP ITS </p><p>PROMISES ON POLITICAL, ECONOMIC AND HUMAN RIGHTS REFORMS.  HE </p><p>CONCEDED THAT PUBLIC AND PARLIAMENTARY OPINION IN EUROPE, </p><p>INCLUDING IN ITALY, WAS "SKEPTICAL" ON TURKEY, BUT ITS </p><p>INTEGRATION WITH EUROPE COULD DEMONSTRATE TO EUROPEAN AND </p><p>ISLAMIC COUNTRIES ALIKE THAT THERE IS A PLACE FOR A MUSLIM </p><p>NATION IN THE EU. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) MOVEMENT ON CYPRUS WAS LESS ENCOURAGING, BUT ACCORDING </p><p>TO CANGELOSI THE TURKISH CYPRIOTS WERE ANGRY AND FRUSTRATED </p><p>WITH DENKTASH FOR NOT MAKING PROGRESS IN COPENHAGEN.  THEY </p><p>REALIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE EU TO THEIR OWN ECONOMIC </p><p>INTERESTS, AND WILL HOPEFULLY PRESSURE DENKTASH TO BE MORE </p><p>COOPERATIVE.  FURTHER, HE CONTINUED, TURKEY WILL NOT ALLOW </p><p>THE PROCESS TO MOVE BACKWARD. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  THE GOI IS PLEASED WITH THE PROGRESS ON </p><p>ESDI/BERLIN-PLUS IN COPENHAGEN, SAID CANGELOSI, AND LOOKS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  06037  01 OF 02  181431Z </p><p>FORWARD TO THE FIRST TEST OF THE EUROPEAN DEFENSE CAPABILITY </p><p>IN MACEDONIA IN TASK FORCE FOX FOLLOW-ON AS EARLY AS SPRING </p><p>2003.  THESE DEVELOPMENTS WOULD ALLOW EUROPE TO TAKE MORE </p><p>DIRECT RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE BALKANS.  HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT </p><p>MORE WORK WAS NEEDED ON THE DETAILS OF THE RELATIONSHIP </p><p>BETWEEN NATO AND ESDP TO AVOID DUPLICATION, AND EUROPE MUST </p><p>INCREASE DEFENSE SPENDING. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  CANGELOSI WAS PLEASED THAT THE COPENHAGEN </p><p>CONCLUSIONS HIGHLIGHTED THE IMPORTANCE OF CONTINUED PROGRESS </p><p>AND EU ENGAGEMENT IN THE BALKANS, AND NOTED THAT BOTH THE </p><p>GREEK AND ITALIAN PRESIDENCIES WOULD MAKE BALKAN (ZAGREB </p><p>PROCESS) AND MEDITERRANEAN (BARCELONA PROCESS) REGIONAL </p><p>STABILIZATION PRIORITIES IN THEIR RESPECTIVE PRESIDENCIES. </p><p>OTHER ITALIAN PRESIDENCY PRIORITIES WILL INCLUDE: </p><p> </p><p>- THE INTER GOVERNMENTAL CONFERENCE AND SIGNING THE </p><p>"CONSTITUTION" DURING THE ITALIAN PRESIDENCY, WHICH WOULD </p><p>AVOID AN "INSTITUTIONAL BOTTLENECK" IN 2004, WHEN THE </p><p>EUROPEAN PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS, ENLARGEMENT, AND COMMISSION </p><p>SELECTION WOULD ALL OCCUR (SEPTEL REPORTS ON FRATTINI\'S AND </p><p>DEP PM FINI\'S REMARKS ON CONVENTION PROGRESS); </p><p> </p><p>-  FINAL ENLARGEMENT ARRANGEMENTS; </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ8647 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  06037  02 OF 02  181431Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   CIAE-00  COME-00  DINT-00  DODE-00 </p><p>      DOEE-00  PERC-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EAP-00   EB-00    E-00 </p><p>      FBIE-00  VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01 </p><p>      L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  NSF-01   OES-00 </p><p>      OIC-02   OMB-01   DHS-00   PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00 </p><p>      P-00     SCT-00   SP-00    SSO-00   SS-00    TRSE-00  T-00 </p><p>      USIE-00  EPAE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-02   G-00 </p><p>      NFAT-00  SAS-00     /009W </p><p>                  ------------------19A392  181432Z /38 </p><p>P 181424Z DEC 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 7374 </p><p>INFO EU CANDIDATE STATES COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p>EU INTEREST COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p>EU MEMBER STATES COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p>AMCONSUL FLORENCE PRIORITY </p><p>AMCONSUL MILAN PRIORITY </p><p>AMCONSUL NAPLES PRIORITY </p><p>USEU BRUSSELS PRIORITY 3017 </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 ROME 006037 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EUR/WE AND EUR/ERA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/18/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, EUN, TU, CY, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: EU COPENHAGEN SUMMIT - GOI CITES PROGRESS ON </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  06037  02 OF 02  181431Z </p><p>TURKEY, ESDP; LOOKS TO ITS PRESIDENCY TO CONTINUE MOMENTUM </p><p>ON ENLARGEMENT, INSTITUTIONAL REFORM; FOCUS ON BALKANS; MED </p><p> </p><p>-  RESTART OF THE LISBON PROCESS (ECONOMIC COMPETITIVENESS); </p><p> </p><p>- JUSTICE AND HOME AFFAIRS, ESPECIALLY IMMIGRATION. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  LATER IN THE DAY, FM FRATTINI GAVE HIS VIEWS ON </p><p>COPENHAGEN RESULTS TO PARLIAMENT.  HE CHARACTERIZED THE </p><p>LANGUAGE ON TURKEY AS AN "ACCEPTABLE COMPROMISE" AND SAID </p><p>THAT IF TURKEY CONTINUES TO PROGRESS ON REFORMS, IT SHOULD </p><p>BEGIN NEGOTIATIONS "WITHOUT DELAY" AFTER THE DECEMBER 2004 </p><p>REVIEW.  THE COMPROMISE ENGENDERED PROGRESS ON BERLIN-PLUS, </p><p>PAVING THE WAY FOR ESDP MILITARY DEPLOYMENT IN MACEDONIA POST </p><p>TASK FORCE FOX.  HE CONFIRMED THAT THE GREEK AND ITALIAN </p><p>PRESIDENCIES WILL "REBALANCE" THE EU\'S ATTENTION TOWARDS THE </p><p>BALKANS AND MED. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U)  FRATTINI TOLD THE PARLIAMENT THAT THE BENEFITS FROM </p><p>ENLARGEMENT -- WIDER MARKETS, INCREASED INVESTMENTS -- WILL </p><p>BE GREATER THAN THE COSTS (APPROXIMATELY 40 BILLION EUROS). </p><p>HE ADDED THAT ITALY HAD OBTAINED A "GUARANTEE" THAT </p><p>STRUCTURAL FUNDS WOULD NOT BE REDUCED, AND WOULD BE INVOLVED </p><p>IN NEGOTIATIONS IN BRUSSELS TO PREVENT THEIR BEING CURTAILED. </p><p> FRATTINI MADE THESE REMARKS WITHOUT ELABORATION.  POST WILL </p><p>FOLLOW UP WITH APPROPRIATE INTERLOCUTORS FOR FURTHER DETAILS. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME06037 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
