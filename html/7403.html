FINN FOR REASONS </p><p>1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: Ambassador held a wide-ranging discussion </p><p>with French Ambassador, Jean Pierre Guinhut, on April 6.  The </p><p>Ambassadors reviewed Afghan security conditions in the </p><p>aftermath of Iraqi Freedom, lingering obstacles to economic </p><p>growth, and progress on the drafting of the Afghan </p><p>Constitution, and other matters.  Highlights included a </p><p>shared view that security conditions in Afghanistan had not </p><p>deteriorated markedly since the war in Iraq began, the French </p><p>Ambassador,s plea that an American economic advisor be added </p><p>to Karzai,s retinue, and the sharing of preliminary news on </p><p>the religious aspects of the new Constitution.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>=============================== </p><p>Isolated High-Profile Incidents </p><p>But Overall Security Stable </p><p>=============================== </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Ambassador Guinhut had just returned from visits to </p><p>Jalalabad, ) for the inauguration of the Human Rights </p><p>Commission Office, and Kandahar, to visit with his NGOs.  He </p><p>traveled with the head of the Human Rights Commission, Dr. </p><p>Sima Samar, as part of an effort to increase his/France,s </p><p>&international presence.8  Ambassador asked if Guinhut had </p><p>heard of the recent murder of Karzai associate, Haji Gilani, </p><p>on April 5.  Guinhut responded that the killing appeared to </p><p>result from a family quarrel rather than any general security </p><p>breakdown, to which Ambassador concurred. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) International assistance agency and NGO workers were </p><p>still alarmed at the recent killing of ICRC employee, Ricardo </p><p>Munguia, on March 27.  Ambassador cautioned that UN SRSG </p><p>Brahimi called the ICRC killing a &qualitative change8 from </p><p>earlier violence, and that a few more such attacks and all </p><p>the NGOs would quit Afghanistan.  Guinhut noted that French </p><p>NGO workers in most of Afghanistan were &not feeling </p><p>threatened but remain cautious8.  Meanwhile, Kandahar-based </p><p>NGOs were &very fearful8 and added that southern areas were </p><p>very unstable. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Ambassador noted that security forces based in </p><p>Kandahar were weak and inactive, adding that President Karzai </p><p>had told him that hostile forces could overrun Kandahar &in </p><p>a day8 if U.S. forces depart.  Guinhut was surprised that </p><p>Karzai would put things so starkly, but added that the Swiss </p><p>Ambassador had told him that Pakistan-based extremists were </p><p>openly infiltrating Afghanistan from Quetta, where the GOP </p><p>did not even bother to cover up these operations.  Ambassador </p><p>added that when the Dutch Ambassador told the Kandahar Police </p><p>Chief about this infiltration, the Chief agreed to follow up </p><p>) if only he could be provided names and addresses of the </p><p>suspects. </p><p>5. (C) Despite these incidents and trends, both agreed that </p><p>general security conditions had not eroded in any systematic </p><p>way after the start of U.S. operations in Iraq.   Guinhut </p><p>summed up his view as &it is as bad as usual in the South </p><p>and not much worse elsewhere8.  The Ambassador noted one </p><p>area of continued concern, though, was Ismail Khan,s renewed </p><p>call for Islamic Jihad against foreigners and the recent </p><p>beating and expulsion of an Afghan Radio Liberty stringer ) </p><p>whom Ismail Khan termed &a spy for the infidels8 - for </p><p>reporting human rights violations in Herat.  Dostum, </p><p>meanwhile, was dabbling in a &federalist8 plan for </p><p>Afghanistan, said Guinhut.  Nonetheless, he pledged his </p><p>strong support to the central government during a recent </p><p>meeting with Guinhut in Mazar.  Ambassador replied that </p><p>federalism was neither a popular nor a feasible option for </p><p>the country. </p><p> </p><p>============================ </p><p>Progress on Constitutional </p><p>Commission, Carcassone Visit </p><p>============================ </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Ambassador turned the discussion to progress on the </p><p>Constitutional Commission,s work.  Guinhut noted that French </p><p>constitutional scholar, Guy Carcassone, was arriving on April </p><p>7 for a two-week stay to advise the Commission and meet with </p><p>interested parties.  Guinhut noted that Carcassone has </p><p>written 25 Constitutions to date, and that his assistance </p><p>could greatly advance the effort.  Ambassador noted that he </p><p>would like to see Carcassone, and later added that since SE </p><p>Khalilzad would be arriving shortly perhaps a larger meeting </p><p>would be appropriate. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Guinhut shared with Ambassador information he </p><p>qualified as rumor ) as VP Shahrani, the head of the </p><p>Constitutional Commission had not actually disclosed such </p><p>information yet ) that the new Constitution would call for </p><p>an elected President, a Prime Minister selected from the </p><p>parliament, and two legislative chambers, and that the King </p><p>was not mentioned.  Ambassador added that he had heard that </p><p>Islam would be designated the state religion, but without a </p><p>sect being specified.  He and others he had spoken to wonder </p><p>why Islam needed to be mentioned at all.  Guinhut replied </p><p>that the 1964 Constitution had struck a balance between Islam </p><p>and the Monarchy to avoid too much power devolving to either. </p><p> French jurist Carcassone reportedly favored a constitutional </p><p>monarchy, Guinhut said, but Karzai reportedly opposed this </p><p>idea and wants a more modern model.  Furthermore, Ambassador </p><p>added, former king Zahir Shah did not want to be king and </p><p>knew no one in his family was qualified to do so. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Comment: Ambassador met with Carcassone April 8 at a </p><p>lunch for the EU Ambassador hosted by the French Ambassador. </p><p>Carcassone confirmed his view that the King should serve as </p><p>constitutional monarch and said the Afghans were pushing for </p><p>a Prime Minister.  Ambassador said both were bad ideas and </p><p>Afghanistan needed a strong President given all the vectors </p><p>of power.  Carcassone said the U.S. system worked only </p><p>because of compromises and a prime ministerial system would </p><p>be better for Afghanistan.  Ambassador demurred, saying it </p><p>would only lead to endless crises of power.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>============================== </p><p>Guinhut Pleads for Appointment </p><p>of American Economic Advisor </p><p>============================== </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) The conversation turned to Karzai,s commitment to </p><p>making needed Cabinet changes to the large and unwieldy </p><p>government.  Guinhut saw the lack of a Minister of Economy as </p><p>a problem.  Ghani was trying to do the job, and was the best </p><p>possible Finance Minister, but he was &no economist8. </p><p>Guinhut recommended that the USG appoint a qualified economic </p><p>advisor to Karzai, at least until the Presidential election. </p><p>This advisor could lay out stages and options for economic </p><p>growth and should carry sufficient credentials to resist </p><p>interference from Ghani.  Guinhut expressed his strong </p><p>preference for an American advisor (he had already tried </p><p>unsuccessfully to recruit a French advisor) rather than an </p><p>Afghan or Afghan expatriate. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Guinhut then commenced a now familiar litany </p><p>regarding the negative attributes of Ghani,s effective </p><p>control of Afghan economic policy.  Guinhut said that Ghani </p><p>and others &gave the impression they were economic liberals, </p><p>but they are not.8  Guinhut offered the investment law as </p><p>illustration of his point, saying it was &made for traders, </p><p>not for investors8 due to its investment-limiting tax </p><p>provisions.  Guinhut disagreed with Ghani,s purported view </p><p>that economic renewal could come through trade.  The economy </p><p>must create jobs, and money is needed from the budget to </p><p>facilitate job creation.  Ambassador said that the TISA was </p><p>not there yet, and was actually driving away investors with </p><p>some of its policies.  Guinhut agreed, noting that taxes on </p><p>investment were &a complete mistake8.  Guinhut also </p><p>expressed surprise that Afghanistan had still not appointed </p><p>an Ambassador to the UAE, which Guinhut regarded as a </p><p>potentially huge investor in Afghan reconstruction.  The </p><p>Ambassador doubted that Afghan Cabinet officials knew what to </p><p>do to spur the economic growth Guinhut described, but Afghans </p><p>may also chafe at a foreign advisor having such extensive </p><p>control over the Afghan economy.  Guinhut feels that without </p><p>such radical intervention, the whole Afghan reconstruction </p><p>program will fail completely and &we8 (major donors) will </p><p>&lose all our money.8 </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) Comment: The French Ambassador,s points on economic </p><p>matters closely track Embassy reporting of the past few </p><p>months.  Afghanistan needs someone: first, to generate ideas </p><p>for economic growth; second, to promote international </p><p>investment; third, to coordinate funding to finance projects; </p><p>fourth, to carry through on projects begun; and fifth, to </p><p>tenaciously finalize projects by removing stubborn obstacles. </p><p> It may be difficult to find any one individual who can do </p><p>all five things.  Ghani is excellent at the first, results </p><p>have been mixed but improving with the third, and he has </p><p>largely failed with the second and latter two items. </p><p>Guinhut,s provocative points corroborate opinions expressed </p><p>through much of the Cabinet and virtually all of the business </p><p>community.  While his view may exaggerate the gravity of the </p><p>situation, it is possible that the right advisor, who could </p><p>bring rapid and visible results, would boost Karzai,s and </p><p>TISA legitimacy enough to dispel concerns about foreign </p><p>influence.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>FINN </p><p></p></div>
