U.S. SPEAKER MICHAEL NOVAK (AMERICAN ENTERPRISE </p><p>INSTITUTE) ADDRESSED KEY ITALIAN AND VATICAN AUDIENCES ON </p><p>THE ISSUE OF "IRAQ AND THE JUST WAR THEORY" FEBRUARY 7- </p><p>    10.  THE PROGRAM OBJECTIVE WAS TO CLARIFY THE JUST NATURE </p><p>OF U.S. IRAQ POLICY TO INFLUENTIAL ITALIAN AND VATICAN </p><p>AUDIENCES, INCLUDING ITALIAN CATHOLIC POLITICAL LEADERS </p><p>STRONGLY INFLUENCED BY TRADITIONAL CATHOLIC JUST WAR </p><p>THEORIES. AS A RESULT OF THE PROGRAM THESE KEY AUDIENCES </p><p>GAINED GREATER UNDERSTANDING AND DEEPER INSIGHT INTO THE </p><p>MOTIVATIONS BEHIND U.S. POLICY IN IRAQ AND THE MORAL </p><p>JUSTIFICATIONS FOR MILITARY ACTION. THE PROGRAM RECEIVED </p><p>EXTENSIVE MEDIA COVERAGE IN INTERNATIONAL, ITALIAN, AND </p><p>VATICAN MEDIA.  THE PROGRAM WAS FUNDED BY IIP AND EMBASSY </p><p>ROME WITH NO NON-USG OR IN-COUNTRY FINANCIAL SUPPORT. </p><p>THE CENTRO STUDI AMERICANI PROVIDED THE VENUE FOR A MAJOR </p><p>PRESS CONFERENCE AND LECTURE. </p><p> </p><p>2. THE PROGRAM, ORGANIZED BY PA ROME AND EMBASSY VATICAN, </p><p>FOCUSED ON AUGUSTINIAN/THOMISTIC JUST WAR THEORY AND ITS </p><p>APPLICATION TO THE POTENTIAL CONFLICT WITH IRAQ.  NOVAK </p><p>LECTURED TO AND HELD SMALL GROUP DISCUSSIONS WITH ITALIAN </p><p>AND VATICAN OPINION LEADERS AND POLICY MAKERS.  DEFENDING </p><p>THE JUST NATURE OF SUCH A WAR, HE DISCUSSED THE ISSUE </p><p>WITH THE HOLY SEE\'S FOREIGN MINISTER, THE, PRESIDENT OF </p><p>THE ITALIAN SENATE, THE STAFF OF THE VATICAN\'S COUNCIL ON </p><p>JUSTICE AND PEACE, AND OFFICIALS FROM THE ITALIAN FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTRY AND PRIME MINISTER\'S OFFICE.  IN ADDITION, HE </p><p>LECTURED TO AN AUDIENCE OF 150 OPINION LEADERS, </p><p>ACADEMICS, CHURCH LEADERS, AND JOURNALISTS; GAVE A PRESS </p><p>CONFERENCE ATTENDED BY MORE THAN 50 JOURNALISTS; APPEARED </p><p>ON A POPULAR ITALIAN TELEVISION CURRENT AFFAIRS PROGRAM; </p><p>AND WAS INTERVIEWED BY VATICAN RADIO, SEVERAL ITALIAN </p><p>NEWSPAPERS, AND THE BBC.  HIS PROGRAM IN ROME RECEIVED </p><p>EXTENSIVE MEDIA COVERAGE. </p><p></p><p>3.  NOVAK WAS AN EXCELLENT SPEAKER AND INTERLOCUTOR.  HIS </p><p>EXTENSIVE FAMILIARITY WITH CURRENT U.S. FOREIGN POLICY, </p><p>HIS FLUENCY IN ITALIAN, HIS EXPERT KNOWLEDGE OF ITALY AND </p><p>THE VATICAN, AND HIS WIDE CONTACTS AMONG ITALIAN AND </p><p>VATICAN POLICY MAKERS, OPINION LEADERS, AND </p><p>INTELLIGENTSIA MADE HIM AN ESPECIALLY EFFECTIVE </p><p>COMMENTATOR ON U.S. POLICY IN IRAQ.  FROM THE BEGINNING </p><p>OF HIS PROGRAM HE MADE IT CLEAR THAT HE WAS A </p><p>SPOKESPERSON FOR NEITHER THE U.S. GOVERNMENT NOR THE </p><p>AMERICAN CATHOLIC COMMUNITY, BUT RATHER AN INDEPENDENT </p><p>SCHOLAR AND WRITER WHO HAD COME TO SHARE HIS VIEWS ABOUT </p><p>U.S. IRAQ POLICY WITH ITALIAN AND VATICAN POLICY MAKERS </p><p>AND OPINION LEADERS AND TO ENTER INTO DIALOGUE WITH THEM. </p><p>HE FOCUSED HIS REMARKS ON THE ETHICAL DIMENSIONS OF U.S. </p><p>IRAQ POLICY AND CAME DOWN STRONGLY ON THE SIDE OF THE </p><p>JUST AND EVEN MORALLY OBLIGATORY CHARACTER OF THAT </p><p>POLICY.  FOR THIS HE WAS FREQUENTLY CHALLENGED AND </p><p>CRITICIZED BY SOME OF HIS INTERLOCUTORS, BUT HE DEFENDED </p><p>HIS VIEWS EFFECTIVELY, COMPELLINGLY, AND GRACIOUSLY.  HIS </p><p>OPINIONS WERE WIDELY REPORTED BY THE ITALIAN MEDIA, AND </p><p>AS OF MARCH 28 HE HAS BEGUN TO WRITE A WEEKLY COLUMN ON </p><p>THE IRAQ WAR IN THE PRESTIGIOUS ITALIAN DAILY "IL SOLE 24- </p><p>ORE." </p><p> </p><p>4. THE QUALITY OF IIP SUPPORT FOR THIS VERY SUCCESSFUL </p><p>PROGRAM WAS OUTSTANDING. IIP\'S JODY ROSE PLATT WORKED </p><p>CLOSELY WITH PA ROME AND DR. NOVAK\'S OFFICE TO RESOLVE </p><p>VARIOUS TRAVEL AND LOGISTICAL PROBLEMS. SHE DESERVES </p><p>KUDOS FOR ENSURING THAT THE VISIT CAME OFF FLAWLESSLY. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p></p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p>	2003ROME01455 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
