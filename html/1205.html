(C) SUMMARY: DEPUTY MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS </p><p>NICHOLAS GOCHE WAS TIGHT-LIPPED OVER POSSIBLE CABINET </p><p>CHANGES IN A JULY 3 CONVERSATION WITH THE AMBASSADOR. </p><p>GOCHE, HOWEVER, NOTED THAT IT WILL BE DIFFICULT FOR THE </p><p>PRESIDENT TO REAPPOINT THOSE MEMBERS WHOM THE PUBLIC </p><p>REJECTED IN THE RECENT PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS.  THE </p><p>MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC) WILL NOT BE INVITED </p><p>INTO THE CABINET, GOCHE SAID.  THE GOVERNMENT AND </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARMERS UNION (CFU) HAVE COME TO AN AGREEMENT </p><p>"IN PRINCIPLE" FOR THE ACQUISITION WITHOUT COMPENSATION </p><p>OF ALMOST ALL THE 804 PUBLICIZED PROPERTIES, ACCORDING </p><p>TO GOCHE.  WAR VETERANS WILL REMAIN ON THE OCCUPIED </p><p>FARMS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) ON JULY 3 THE AMBASSADOR, ACCOMPANIED BY POLOFF, </p><p>CALLED ON THE DEPUTY MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS, </p><p>NICHOLAS GOCHE, FOR A POST-PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS </p><p>ASSESSMENT OF THE GOVERNMENT.  GOCHE WAS IN A LESS </p><p>COMBATIVE MOOD THAN WHEN THE AMBASSADOR LAST SAW HIM ON </p><p>JUNE 12,  TO DELIVER A JOINT DEMARCHE WITH OTHER HEADS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03652  01 OF 03  051408Z </p><p>OF MISSIONS TO CONDEMN POLITICAL VIOLENCE AND CALL FOR A </p><p>HALT TO IT IN THE COUNTRY (REFTEL A).  GOCHE PLAYED OFF </p><p>THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE MDC\'S 57 SEAT WIN TO ZANU-PF\'S </p><p>62 IN THE JUNE 24 AND 25 VOTE, NOTING "THE RURAL AREAS </p><p>VOTED FOR LAND AND THE URBAN AREAS VOTED FOR JOBS. </p><p>CONCEDING THAT HIGH URBAN UNEMPLOYMENT LOST THE ELECTION </p><p>IN THOSE AREAS FOR ZANU-PF GOCHE, SAID THE MDC COULD </p><p>HAVE "PUT UP A FROG" IN THOSE AREAS AND STILL WOULD HAVE </p><p>WON AGAINST THE RULING PARTY.  NEVERTHELESS, THE DEPUTY </p><p>MINISTER SAID IT\'S GOOD OTHER VOICES ARE IN PARLIAMENT; </p><p>NOW THE MDC HAS TO PROVE WHETHER ITS MEMBERS CAN </p><p>ARTICULATE THEIR POLICIES TO HELP ALLEVIATE THE PEOPLE\'S </p><p>SUFFERING. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) IN RESPONSE TO THE AMBASSADOR\'S QUESTIONS ABOUT </p><p>POSSIBLE NEW FACES IN THE CABINET, THE DEPUTY MINISTER </p><p>BECAME TIGHT-LIPPED.  GOCHE FLAT OUT REFUSED TO SHARE </p><p>ANY OF THE RULING PARTY\'S THINKING, WHICH CAME OUT OF </p><p>THE EXTRAORDINARY TWO-DAY POLITBURO MEETING ON JUNE 28 </p><p>AND 30.  GOCHE SAID IT WAS A SHAME THAT THE PARTY LOST </p><p>CERTAIN PARLIAMENTARY SEATS CURRENTLY HELD BY CABINET </p><p>MEMBERS SUCH AS, MINES, ENVIRONMENT AND TOURISM </p><p>MINISTER, SIMON KHAYA MOYO, MINISTER OF STATE IN THE </p><p>VICE PRESIDENT\'S OFFICE, SITHEMBISO GLADYS NYONI, AND </p><p>MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS, DUMISO DABENGWA.  ONE UNIQUE </p><p>CASE FOR THE PRESIDENT TO CONSIDER WILL BE THE </p><p>REAPPOINTMENT OF THE ONLY REMAINING WHITE MEMBER OF HIS </p><p>CABINET, MINISTER OF HEALTH AND CHILD WELFARE, TIMOTHY </p><p>STAMPS.  STAMPS RAN ON THE ZANU-PF TICKET AT THE PRIMARY </p><p>STAGE AND WAS DEFEATED.  THE HEALTH MINISTER REMAINED IN </p><p>THE CABINET AFTER THE PRIMARIES AND WAS NOT ELIGIBLE TO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03652  01 OF 03  051408Z </p><p>CONTEST IN THE PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS FOR ZANU-PF. </p><p>CONSEQUENTLY STAMPS HAS NEVER "FACED THE PEOPLE" AND </p><p>TECHNICALLY HAS NOT BEEN REJECTED BY THEM, SO MUGABE </p><p>COULD REAPPOINT HIM WITH LESS DIFFICULTY THAN THOSE THE </p><p>PEOPLE VOTED OUT, GOCHE ADDED.  THE DEPUTY MINISTER </p><p>DISMISSED THE IDEA OF THE MDC BEING OFFERED ANY </p><p>POSITIONS IN THE CABINET. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) ECHOING MUGABE\'S TELEVISED CNN INTERVIEW OF A </p><p>FEW DAYS BEFORE, GOCHE SAID THE MDC COULD NOT BE BROUGHT </p><p>INTO THE GOVERNMENT AS ITS MEMBERS WERE UNKNOWN </p><p>QUANTITIES, AND THAT THERE HAD BEEN NO UNITY GOVERNMENT </p><p>TALKS AT THIS STAGE.  MOREOVER, GOCHE SAID THE MDC WOULD </p><p>NOT ACCEPT </p><p></p></div>
