(C) SUMMARY: RECENT CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN CHARGE, </p><p>POLOFF, AND THREE MID-LEVEL ZANU-PF OFFICIALS REINFORCED </p><p>THE NOTION THAT ZANU-PF IS NOT THE MONOLITH OF OPINION </p><p>THAT IS OFTEN CONVEYED IN THE PRESS.  CHARGE AND POLOFF </p><p>SPOKE TO DEPUTY MINISTER FOR EDUCATION, SPORTS AND </p><p>CULTURE AENEAS CHIGWEDERE, MASVINGO SOUTH MP EDDISON </p><p>ZVOBGO, AND MASHONALAND EAST PARTY CHAIRMAN PADDY </p><p>ZHANDA.  ALTHOUGH THE THREE OFFICIALS AGREED ON SOME </p><p>THINGS, SUCH AS THE IMPERATIVE FOR LAND REDISTRIBUTION </p><p>AND THE WEAKNESS OF THE MDC, THEY DISAGREED </p><p>SUBSTANTIALLY IN OTHER AREAS LIKE THE DIRECTION OF THE </p><p>PARTY, ATTACKS ON THE JUDICIARY, AND THE ROLE OF WAR </p><p>VETERANS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) ON FEBRUARY 26, CHARGE AND POLOFF SPOKE TO </p><p>DEPUTY MINISTER FOR EDUCATION, SPORTS AND CULTURE AENEAS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00871  01 OF 03  281442Z </p><p>CHIGWEDERE (AND MP FOR HWEDZA DISTRICT), AND MASVINGO </p><p>"SUPREMO" AND MP FOR MASVINGO SOUTH EDDISON ZVOBGO. </p><p>POLOFF SPOKE TO MASHONALAND EAST PARTY CHAIRMAN PADDY </p><p>ZHANDA ON FEBRUARY 27.  ALTHOUGH A RANKING PARTY </p><p>OFFICIAL AND CHAIRMAN OF THE NOW-PRIVATIZED COTTON </p><p>COMPANY OF ZIMBABWE, ZHANDA HAS NO POSITION IN </p><p>GOVERNMENT. </p><p> </p><p>ZANU-PF MORALE </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) RECENTLY REMOVED FROM THE ZANU-PF POLITBURO, </p><p>EDDISON ZVOBGO WAS LESS THAN SANGUINE ABOUT MORALE IN </p><p>THE PARTY.  WHEN ASKED HOW THE RECENT SACKING OF FIVE </p><p>PROVINCIAL EXECUTIVES HAD AFFECTED MORALE, HE STATED THE </p><p>EFFECT WAS "VERY SERIOUS."  (MASVINGO ALLIES OF </p><p>PRESIDENT MUGABE ALSO SENT ZVOBGO\'S FACTION RIDING OUT </p><p>OF TOWN ON A RAIL AFTER PARTY PROVINCIAL ELECTIONS </p><p>FEBRUARY 24.  SEE REFTEL.)  ZVOBGO TOLD US THAT THE </p><p>PARTY LEADERSHIP SEEMED TO BE "INFLICTING DAMAGE ON THE </p><p>BODY POLITIC" FOR NO APPARENT REASON.  "HOW IS MAKING </p><p>PEOPLE UNHAPPY THE WAY TO WIN AN ELECTION?" HE ASKED </p><p>RHETORICALLY.  HIS COLLEAGUES IN PARLIAMENT ARE HOPING </p><p>SOMEONE WILL SET ZANU-PF STRAIGHT, BUT THEY ARE </p><p>"ABSOLUTELY PETRIFIED" TO SPEAK OUT AGAINST THE PARTY, </p><p>ZVOBGO SAID.  INFORMATION MINISTER JONATHAN MOYO HAS </p><p>"STRUCK THUNDER" INTO THE HEARTS OF ZANU-PF MPS.  ZVOBGO </p><p>TOLD US THAT HE REMINDED MOYO WHAT HAPPENED TO JOE </p><p>MCCARTHY IN THE U.S. DURING THE 1950S--OTHER SENATORS </p><p>WERE AFRAID TO CHALLENGE HIM UNTIL THEY WOKE UP TO HIS </p><p>MAD CAMPAIGN AND LEFT HIM A "BROKEN MAN" IN THE END. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00871  01 OF 03  281442Z </p><p>"THE SAME WILL HAPPEN TO YOU," ZVOBGO SUPPOSEDLY WARNED </p><p>MOYO. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) PROVINCIAL PARTY CHAIRMAN ZHANDA ACKNOWLEDGED </p><p>THAT THERE ARE VOICES OF DISSENT IN ZANU-PF.  HOWEVER, </p><p>THE DISSENTERS ARE MORE CONCERNED WITH SURVIVAL RIGHT </p><p>NOW THAN CHANGING THE DIRECTION OF THE PARTY.  ZHANDA </p><p>LIKENED THE PARTY\'S "COMBATIVE" MODE TO A RISING FLOOD. </p><p>MOST MEMBERS ARE SIMPLY BEING SWEPT ALONG, FRANTICALLY </p><p>GRABBING FOR ANY BRANCH THAT COMES ALONG JUST TO STAY </p><p>AFLOAT. </p><p> </p><p>DIRECTION OF THE PARTY </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) DEPUTY MINISTER CHIGWEDERE WAS MORE CONFIDENT </p><p>ABOUT THE PARTY\'S DIRECTION.  HE BELIEVES THAT IF </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS WERE HELD TOMORROW, ZANU-PF </p><p>WOULD WIN BACK HALF THE SEATS IT LOST TO THE MDC LAST </p><p>JUNE.  HE THINKS ZANU-PF WOULD WIN BACK ALL THE SEATS IN </p><p>HARARE\'S HIGH-DENSITY SUBURBS, BUT ADMITTED THE LOW- </p><p>DENSITY SUBURBS, WHERE MOST WHITES LIVE, ARE A LOST </p><p>CAUSE.  CHIGWEDERE CLAIMED THAT THE PEOPLE NOW SEE ZANU- </p><p>PF AS THE PARTY OF ACTION THAT CAN DELIVER THEM FROM </p><p>THEIR MISERY, BECAUSE THE MDC HAS DONE LI </p><p></p></div>
