<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 009135 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR NEA/NGA AND EUR/SE </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH </p><p>PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/25/2012 </p><p>TAGS: MARR, MOPS, PREL, IZ, TU, Iraq </p><p>SUBJECT: IRAQ: OPERATION NORTHERN WATCH AND CIVILIAN </p><p>OVERFLIGHTS OF THE ROZ -- GOT REFUSES TO RE-ROUTE </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. (A) ANKARA 4444 </p><p>     B. (B) ANKARA 2904 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by DCM Robert Deutsch, reasons 1.5, b/d. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) MFA DG/Americas Banguoglu called in the DCM </p><p>(accompanied by the Office of Defense Cooperation (ODC) Chief </p><p>and Pol-Mil Counselor) 12/24 to respond to our 11/29 dipnote </p><p>urging the MFA to end the practice of routing civilian </p><p>passenger flights over the ONW Resticted Operating Zone (ROZ) </p><p>in southeast Turkey during operations.  Our note had stressed </p><p>that any solution that failed to keep the ROZ free of </p><p>civilian flights during ONW missions placed civilian </p><p>passenger planes at an unacceptable level of risk.  We also </p><p>had warned that if the practice were not changed, the embassy </p><p>would have to consider advising American travelers to avoid </p><p>airlines using that corridor (VG-8).  Our note followed a </p><p>near-collision in March 2002, several ODC/Embassy meetings </p><p>the Turkish General Staff (TGS) and Turkish Air Force (TUAF), </p><p>the Ambassador\'s June meeting with the former Transportation </p><p>Minister specifically to address this problem, and several </p><p>subsequent meetings with the TGS and Turkish Air Force.  In </p><p>July, TGS wrote ODC that an alternate air route was being </p><p>developed, and in October, the Turkish ONW Chief of Staff </p><p>wrote the US COS indicating that the new route, which skirted </p><p>the ROZ to the north, would be implemented by 10/15. </p><p>However, just prior to that date, the Turkish COS notified </p><p>the US COS that implementation was on hold.  Since the ONW US </p><p>Co-Commander still felt that the reduced altitude block </p><p>allocated to ONW was not large enough to perform the mission </p><p>safely, especially during winter weather, we sent the 11/29 </p><p>dipnote. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Banguoglu reviewed the MFA\'s dipnote reply before </p><p>handing it over (text in para 6).  Sitting in was the MFA\'s </p><p>advisor for aviation affairs, a retired TUAF colonel, who </p><p>also spoke at some length.  Banguoglu\'s main point was that </p><p>the GOT, including TGS and MFA, considered the US claims of </p><p>danger "exaggerated" ("There is no tremendous danger," he </p><p>said).  The ROZ was not an "active combat zone," but rather </p><p>only a NOTAM\'d restricted zone.  If evasive maneuvers by ONW </p><p>aircraft necessitated their flying above 28 thousand feet, </p><p>they could simply notify the relevant air traffic controllers </p><p>(ATC).  The GOT felt five thousand feet of separation below </p><p>the 33 thousand-foot civilian floor was more than sufficient. </p><p> That was more than Turkey allowed for NATO exercises. </p><p>Banguoglu also said the GOT regarded as "most unnessary" our </p><p>warning that we would recommend US travelers avoid airlines </p><p>using the ROZ corridor. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The DCM and ODC Chief pushed back.  If MiG-25\'s come </p><p>out of northern Iraq, that is not an exercise.  The ROZ is an </p><p>integral part of a real-world combat operation.  Pol-Mil </p><p>Counselor stressed that warning ATC of evasive maneuvers at </p><p>high speeds could well be insufficient to avoid a </p><p>catastrophe.  ODC Chief also noted that civilian airliners </p><p>had flown below 33 thousand feet and promised to follow up </p><p>with documentation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The DCM concluded to Banguoglu that Turkey and the US </p><p>have differing perceptions of what constitutes acceptable </p><p>risk.  We would continue to pursue this issue, probably in </p><p>the military consultations on Iraq, once they resumed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Comment:  Indeed, once the mil-mil talks resume, we </p><p>will hit the Turks again with this issue. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  Begin text of Turkish 12/24 dipnote: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Replublic of Turkey </p><p>presents its compliments to the Embassy of the United States </p><p>of America and with reference to the Latter\'s Note numbered </p><p>1338, dated November 29, 2002, has the honour to inform the </p><p>Embassy that the issue of safety of civilian passenger </p><p>flights in the airspace over the Operation Northern Watch\'s </p><p>(ONW) Restricted Operating Zone (ROZ) has been re-examined </p><p>with the participation of all relevant Turkish aurthorities. </p><p>There appears to be certain conceptual differences in the </p><p>views of the Turkish and USA authorities.  The considered </p><p>opinion of the Turkish side is the following: </p><p>Based on mutual agreement between the Turkish and the US </p><p>military, ROZ is not an "active combat zone", but is a </p><p>NOTAMed "Restricted Airspace" within the sovereign airspace </p><p>of Turkey.  The upper limit of ROZ is 28,000 feet.  Upon a </p><p>request made by the relevant US authorities, as an </p><p>exceptional practice, an additional 5,000 feet zone above the </p><p>29,000 feet is not allocated to civilian air traffic.  As a </p><p>result of this, at the VG-8 air corridor which passes </p><p>east-west over ROZ, civilian aircrafts are permitted to fly </p><p>only over 33,000 feet.  VG-8 has been operational not since </p><p>March 2002, but since after the Gulf War under the conditions </p><p>explained herebefore.  As long as the ONW operations are </p><p>conducted within the NOTAMed limits of the ROZ area which </p><p>they are required to in line with the international norms and </p><p>practices, as well as Turkish national regulations, there </p><p>will not be any risk left for the safety of the civilian </p><p>aircrafts over flying the ROZ.  Turkish military authorities </p><p>are of the opinion that a ROZ level of 28,000 feet is enough </p><p>to meet the current needs of the ONW flights.  In exceptional </p><p>cases when a technical or emergency requirement necessitates </p><p>an ONW operated aircraft to fly above the NOTAMed area (which </p><p>is up to 28,000 feet), in line with the international norms, </p><p>it is the sole responsibility of that aircraft to inform </p><p>immediately the relevant ATC or controlling military units, </p><p>in order to ensure that necessary flight safety precautions </p><p>are taken. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>As far as the requirements of the civilian air traffic is </p><p>concerned, there is a continued need for the services of the </p><p>VG-8 air corridor, in addition to the services of the newly </p><p>opened UT-36 to the north of VG-8.  Within this context and </p><p>in the light of the close cooperation between Turkey and the </p><p>United States, the phrase "....recommend advising all </p><p>American travelers that they avoid airlines using VG-8" is </p><p>considered to be unnecessary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Turkey </p><p>avails itself of this opportunity to renew the Embassy of the </p><p>United States of America the assurances of its highest </p><p>consideration. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Ankara, December 24, 2002. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>End text. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
