THE BALLOONING PUBLIC DEFICIT IS A MATTER </p><p>OF GREAT CONCERN TO THE GOI, SEVERAL KEY ECONOMIC </p><p>POLICYMAKERS TOLD ECONOMIC COUNSELOR DURING A SERIES OF </p><p>RECENT MEETINGS. DEPUTY FINANCE MINISTER MARIO BALDASSARRI, </p><p>FINANCE MINISTRY UNDER SECRETARY VITO TANZI, AND SENIOR </p><p>RESEARCHER AT THE BANK OF ITALY DANIELE FRANCO EXPRESSED </p><p>CONCERN ABOUT THE PUBLIC DEFICIT, WHICH IS LIKELY TO EXCEED </p><p>THE 2002 TARGET OF 1.1 PERCENT. THE GOI FACES MOUNTING </p><p>EXPENDITURES FOR HEALTH AND EDUCATION.  PENSION AND INTEREST </p><p>PAYMENTS CANNOT BE CUT.  SECURITY AND DEFENSE COSTS HAVE </p><p>PUSHED UP THE DEFICIT.  AT THE SAME TIME, THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC </p><p>SLOWDOWN HAS PUSHED TAX REVENUES BELOW EXPECTATIONS.  FINANCE </p><p>MINISTER TREMONTI HAS CHOSEN TO DELAY MEETING STABILITY PACT </p><p>TARGETS FOR TWO YEARS TO ENCOURAGE ECONOMIC GROWTH.  HE PLANS </p><p>TO CUT TAXES AND INVEST IN NEEDED INFRASTRUCTURE, WHILE </p><p>EXERTING TOUGH PRESSURE ON OTHER GOVERNMENT SPENDING.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT,S FIRST YEAR </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) THE MEETING WITH BALDASSARRI TOOK PLACE A FEW DAYS </p><p>AFTER THE APPROVAL OF THE DPEF, THE 2002-2006 GOI BUDGET </p><p>PLAN.  BALDASSARRI SAID THAT THE GOI HAD FACED DIFFICULT </p><p>ECONOMIC CIRCUMSTANCES IN ITS FIRST YEAR.  HE MENTIONED THAT </p><p>GOVERNMENT EFFORTS TO JUMP-START ECONOMIC GROWTH HAD BEEN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  04053  01 OF 03  200811Z </p><p>UNDERMINED BY THE 2001 DEFICIT INHERITED FROM THE PREVIOUS </p><p>ADMINISTRATION, USD 18 BILLION DOLLARS LARGER THAN EXPECTED, </p><p>AND ECONOMIC REVERBERATIONS FROM SEPT. 11.  THE INHERITED </p><p>DEFICIT AND THE ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN TOGETHER FORCED FINANCE </p><p>MINISTER TREMONTI TO POSTPONE PLANS FOR TAX CUTS. </p><p> </p><p>3. BALDASSARI EXPLAINED THAT THE WORSENING INTERNATIONAL </p><p>OUTLOOK FOLLOWING SEPT. 11 SLOWED THE ITALIAN GROWTH RATE </p><p>FROM 2.3 PERCENT TO 1.3 PERCENT IN 2001, AND TO THE LIKELY </p><p>ONE PERCENT OR LOWER IN 2002.  TO STIMULATE GROWTH IN 2003, </p><p>THE GOI PLANS TO IMPLEMENT THE FIRST PART OF PLANNED TAX CUTS </p><p>-- CUTTING TAXES FOR LOWER INCOME LEVELS. </p><p> </p><p>2002 PUBLIC FINANCE TRENDS </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) ON AUGUST 1, ECONOFFS MET WITH DANIELE FRANCO, CHIEF </p><p>OF THE PUBLIC FINANCE DIVISION OF THE RESEARCH DEPARTMENT OF </p><p>THE BANK OF ITALY.  FRANCO WAS ALSO PESSIMISTIC ABOUT PUBLIC </p><p>FINANCE TRENDS IN 2002.  THE PUBLIC DEFICIT GREW FASTER IN </p><p>THE FIRST HALF OF THIS YEAR THAN IN CORRESPONDING PERIOD LAST </p><p>YEAR. THE PUBLIC DEFICIT WAS E31.1 BILLION THROUGH JULY 2002, </p><p>UP 29 PERCENT OR 7 BILLION EURO OVER THE CORRESPONDING PERIOD </p><p>IN 2001.  FRANCO POINTED TO THE SAME PROBLEMS AS HAD THE </p><p>FINANCE MINISTRY OFFICIALS -- THE ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN HAD MEANT </p><p>LOWER REVENUES, WHILE GOVERNMENT SPENDING HAD EDGED UP, </p><p>PARTICULARLY IN THE AREA OF HEALTH CARE.  DEEP STRUCTURAL </p><p>REFORMS WERE STILL NEEDED -- INCLUDING TAX REFORM AND PENSION </p><p>REFORM. FRANCO ADDED THAT THE GOI\'S PROBLEMS HAD BEEN </p><p>COMPLICATED BY AN EUROSTAT DECISION TO REVISE THE 2001 PUBLIC </p><p>DEFICIT FIGURE UPWARDS TO 2.2 PERCENT OF GDP.  EUROSTAT HAD </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  04053  01 OF 03  200811Z </p><p>DISAGREED WITH THE GOI\'S ACCOUNTING FOR SECURITIZED REVENUES </p><p>FROM LOTTERY PROCEEDS AND REAL ESTATE SALES. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) FRANCO NOTED THAT THE GOI HAD GENERATED EURO 50 </p><p>MILLION TO DATE FROM A MEASURE ALLOWING ITALIANS TO </p><p>REPATRIATE CAPITAL HELD OVERSEAS (AND NOT DECLARED FOR TAX </p><p>PURPOSES) IN RETURN FOR A ONE-TIME 2.5 PERCENT PENALTY. </p><p>NONETHELESS, HE PREDICTED THAT THE 1.1 PERCENT DEFICIT/GDP </p><p>TARGET FOR 2002 WOULD BE EXCEEDED. </p><p> </p><p>2003 BUDGET </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU)  BOTH TANZI AND BALDASSARI STRESSED THAT THE GOI </p><p>FACES INTENSE PRESSURE TO BRING THE 2003 BUDGET DEFICIT DOWN. </p><p> WHILE FINANCE MINISTER TREMONTI HAD POSTPONED BALANCING THE </p><p>BUDGET TO 2005 (FROM 2003), HE REMAINS FIRMLY COMMITTED TO </p><p>KEEPING THE DEFICIT TO A MINIMUM.  AT THE SAME TIME, TREMONTI </p><p>AND PRIME MINISTER BERLUSCONI HAVE PROMISED TAX CUTS AND NEW </p><p>INVESTMENT IN INFRASTRUCTURE.  GIVEN THESE CONSTRAINTS, </p><p>TREMONTI IS SEEKING TO CUT WHEREVER POSSIBLE AND TO CAP </p><p>SPENDING IN ALL MINISTRIES. </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) FINANCE U/S TANZI EXPLAINED THAT HE HAD FOUND HIMSELF </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ6101 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  04053  02 OF 03  200812Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00  COME-00 </p><p>      CTME-00  INL-00   DODE-00  DOEE-00  DOTE-00  ANHR-00  SRPP-00 </p><p>      EB-00    EXIM-01  E-00     FAAE-00  VC-00    FRB-00   H-01 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   ITC-01   LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   MMP-00 </p><p>      AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OIG-03   OMB-01   OPIC-01  ACE-00 </p><p>      SP-00    SSO-00   SS-00    STR-00   USIE-00  LBA-00   DRL-02 </p><p>      G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /013W </p><p>                  ------------------DB64DF  200813Z /38 </p><p>P 200738Z AUG 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 5459 </p><p>INFO EU MEMBER STATES COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p>AMCONSUL FLORENCE PRIORITY </p><p>AMCONSUL FRANKFURT PRIORITY </p><p>AMCONSUL MILAN PRIORITY </p><p>AMCONSUL NAPLES PRIORITY </p><p>DEPT OF TREASURY WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>USEU BRUSSELS PRIORITY 2792 </p><p>DEPT OF LABOR WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 ROME 004053 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/19/2007 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, KPRP, ELAB, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: KEY ECONOMIC POLICY-MAKERS ON GOI BUDGET ISSUES </p><p> </p><p>FAR MORE CONSTRAINED THAN HE HAD EXPECTED IN CUTTING </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  04053  02 OF 03  200812Z </p><p>GOVERNMENT SPENDING. MUCH OF THE SPENDING SIMPLY CANNOT BE </p><p>CUT.  POST-SEPTEMBER 11 SECURITY SPENDING AND MILITARY </p><p>SPENDING FOR OPERATION ENDURING FREEDOM HAD BEEN COSTLY, BUT </p><p>ESSENTIAL.  PENSION PAYMENTS ABSORB A TOTAL 18 PERCENT OF THE </p><p>BUDGET, HEALTH SPENDING SIX PERCENT, EDUCATION AND OTHER </p><p>SOCIAL SPENDING 12 PERCENT AND INTEREST ON ITALY,S FOREIGN </p><p>DEBT ANOTHER 13 PERCENT. </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) THE HEALTH SECTOR REFORM, ADOPTED IN LATE 2001 AS PART </p><p>OF ITALY\'S DEVOLUTION OF AUTHORITY TO THE REGIONAL </p><p>GOVERNMENTS, HAS NOT CONTAINED GOVERNMENT HEALTH SPENDING AS </p><p>PREDICTED.  WHEN MANAGEMENT OF HEALTH CAR WAS DEVOLVED TO THE </p><p>REGIONAL GOVERNMENTS, ALONG WITH THE FUNDING, TOTAL </p><p>EXPENDITURES WERE CAPPED AT 6 PERCENT OF GDP.  HOWEVER, THE </p><p>REGIONS HAVE (PARTICULARLY IN THE SOUTH) SPENT MORE THAN </p><p>ALLOWED.  THE GOI IS LEGALLY FORBIDDEN TO SIMPLY DENY HEALTH </p><p>CARE TO ITALIAN CITIZENS, AND THUS MUST PROVIDE THE </p><p>ADDITIONAL FUNDING REQUIRED.  THE 2003 BUDGET LAW WILL, </p><p>THEREFORE, HAVE TO INCLUDE ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR HEALTH </p><p>CARE.  TANZI NOTED THAT THE RISING COST OF HEALTH IS ONE OF </p><p>THE MOST SERIOUS CONCERNS TO THE FINANCE MINISTRY. </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) THE 2003 BUDGET IS TIGHT, NOTED BALDASSARI, BUT </p><p>INCLUDES SEVERAL ELEMENTS INTENDED TO SPUR ECONOMIC GROWTH. </p><p> </p><p>A. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FIRST TRANCHE OF THE TAX REFORM, </p><p>WHICH WILL BENEFIT LOWER INCOME FAMILIES, WHO ALSO ARE THOSE </p><p>MOST AFFECTED BY THE PRICE INCREASES RELATED TO THE EURO </p><p>CHANGEOVER. (DANIELE FRANCO OF THE BOI PREDICTED THAT THIS </p><p>FIRST ROUND OF TAX CUTS WOULD COST SLIGHTLY OVER ONE PERCENT </p><p>OF GDP.) </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  04053  02 OF 03  200812Z </p><p> </p><p>B. A LABOR PACT MADE WITH EMPLOYERS, REPRESENTATIVES AND THE </p><p>MAIN TRADE UNION CONFEDERATIONS. (NOTE: THE PACT DOES NOT </p><p>INCLUDE CGIL, THE LARGEST UNION IN TERMS OF MEMBERSHIP AND </p><p>WHICH OPTED OUT OF THE PACT.) THE MOST IMPORTANT MEASURES OF </p><p>THE PACT ARE THE 36-MONTH SUSPENSION OF ARTICLE 18 OF THE </p><p>LABOR STATUTE FOR THOSE NEWLY HIRED IN COMPANIES WITH FEWER </p><p>THAN 15 WORKERS, AND AN EXTENDED PAYMENT PERIOD OF </p><p>UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS. (REF A PROVIDES BACKGROUND ON ARTICLE </p><p>18 AND THE LABOR PACT.) </p><p> </p><p>C. IMPLEMENTATION OF AN AMBITIOUS INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT </p><p>PROGRAM (SEE PARA 12). </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) BALDASSARRI SAID THAT THE FINANCE MINISTRY HAS </p><p>REDUCED ITS OWN COSTS FOR PROCURING GOODS AND SERVICES BY </p><p>ONE-THIRD IN 2002, BY CREATING "CONSIP", WHICH HAS </p><p>IMPLEMENTED A PROGRAM OF ON-LINE PURCHASING.  IN 2003, THE </p><p>GOI WILL EXPAND ON-LINE PURCHASES OF GOODS AND SERVICES, </p><p>THROUGH CONSIP, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO REDUCE THESE </p><p>EXPENDITURES BY AT LEAST 10 PERCENT -- A SAVINGS OF 40-50 </p><p>MILLION EURO. </p><p> </p><p>A NEW TAX? AN AMNESTY? </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11. (C)  U/S TANZI (PROTECT) MENTIONED THAT THERE WERE TWO </p><p>MORE MEASURES UNDER SERIOUS CONSIDERATION FOR THE 2003 </p><p>BUDGET: A ONE-TIME TAX AND A TAX AMNESTY.  TANZI SAW PROBLEMS </p><p>WITH BOTH.  A ONE-TIME TAX WOULD RAISE SOME REVENUE, BUT </p><p>WOULD BE AN UNPOPULAR MEASURE.  IT WOULD BE HARSHLY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  04053  02 OF 03  200812Z </p><p>CRITICIZED AS A BREAKING OF PRIME MINISTER BERLUSCONI\'S </p><p>PROMISE TO CUT TAXES.  THE PROPOSED AMNESTY FOR TAX EVADERS </p><p>(PERMITTING THEM TO PAY A ONE-TIME PENALTY AND RETURN TO THE </p><p>TAX SYSTEM) WOULD, IN TANZI\'S OPINION, BE EVEN WORSE.  TAX </p><p>PARDONS, HE ARGUED, ARE NEGATIVE BECAUSE THEY CREATE </p><p>EXPECTATIONS FOR FURTHER TAX PARDONS IN THE FUTURE AND LEAD </p><p>TO FURTHER EVASION.  MOREOVER, THEY ANGER LAW-ABIDING </p><p>TAXPAYERS. </p><p> </p><p>INFRASTRUCTURE </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>12. (SBU) THE 2003 BUDGET WILL INCLUDE AN INVESTMENT PROGRAM </p><p>FOR PUBLIC SECTOR INFRASTRUCTURE ) ROADS PRIMARILY. TANZI </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGED THAT IMPROVEMENTS IN INFRASTRUCTURE ARE A </p><p>LONG-TERM GOI PROJECT; IN THE SHORT TERM, NO EFFECT ON GDP </p><p>GROWTH IS EXPECTED. </p><p> </p><p>13. (SBU) DEPUTY MINISTER BALDASSARRI BELIEVES THAT THE GOI\'S </p><p>NEWLY CREATED COMPANY, INFRASTRUTTURE S.P.A., WILL ENSURE </p><p>THAT INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS ARE DONE IMPLEMENTED ACCORDING </p><p>TO PRIORITY AND ON A TIMELY BASIS. INFRASTRUTTURE S.P.A. WILL </p><p>HELP FINANCE INFRASTRUCTURE AND PUBLIC WORK PROJECTS BY </p><p>ISSUING BONDS.

(U) THE BOI\'S FRANCO NOTED THAT THE BUDGET DOCUMENT DPEF </p><p>2003-2006 ASSUMES INVESTMENT IN INFRASTRUCTURE WILL EQUAL </p><p>FIVE PERCENT OF GDP EACH YEAR.  FRANCO DOUBTS THAT GOI WILL </p><p>BE ABLE TO FINANCE THIS LEVEL OF INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT </p><p>FROM PRIVATE FINANCING ALONE. </p><p> </p><p>PRIVATIZATIONS </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>15. (U) ACCORDING TO BALDASSARI, THE BERLUSCONI GOVERNMENT </p><p>PLANS TO ACCELERATE PRIVATIZATIONS DURING 2003, IF MARKET </p><p>CONDITIONS IMPROVE.  THE FIRST TO BE SOLD WILL BE THE GOI\'S </p><p>TOBACCO MANUFACTURING COMPANY ETI.  FURTHER ASSETS OF THE GOI </p><p>ELECTRICITY COMPANY ENEL WILL ALSO BE AUCTIONED IN 2003. THE </p><p>GOI INTENDS TO SELL ALL BUT 30 PERCENT OF ENEL AND THE </p><p>HYDROCARBONS FIRM ENI. BALDASSARI SAID THAT THERE WERE PLANS </p><p>TO SELL OFF THE GOI\'S RAILWAYS AND THE POSTAL SERVICE, BUT </p><p>NOT IN THE NEAR TERM.
