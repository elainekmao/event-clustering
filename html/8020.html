Northern Shan State, including </p><p>areas controlled by cease-fire groups like the Kokang </p><p>Chinese, was essentially clear of opium production.  However, </p><p>farmers were paying the price for eradication.  Normally </p><p>subsisting on incomes of less than $200/year, farmers and </p><p>their families may starve this year. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>"The Era of Opium Cultivation in Burma is Ending" </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) After a month-long assessment of the Wa Alternative </p><p>Development Project in northeast Shan State, UNODC\'s </p><p>assessment mission told diplomats, representatives of UN </p><p>agencies, and INGOs April 10 that "the era of opium </p><p>cultivation in Burma is plainly ending."  According to the </p><p>mission, opium cultivation had largely ended in northern Shan </p><p>State.  This was true even in cease-fire areas that were </p><p>previously centers of production.  Shan State Special Region </p><p>1 in the Kokang, in particular, is completely clear of opium. </p><p> According to the assessment mission, cultivation continues </p><p>in the territories controlled by the United Wa State Army, </p><p>but even there cultivators are aware of the pending deadline </p><p>fixed by the Wa authorities.  By the end of the 2004/05 </p><p>growing season, the Wa-controlled Special Region 2 is also </p><p>scheduled to be opium-free. </p><p> </p><p>People May Starve </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) The downside of these developments, however, is a </p><p>potential humanitarian catastrophe among the farmers </p><p>dependent on growing opium for their income.  According to </p><p>the mission, farmers in northern and eastern Shan State are </p><p>already poor.  Yearly incomes run about $200/year, malaria is </p><p>endemic, and child mortality rates (i.e., the number of </p><p>children that die before the age of five) may run as high as </p><p>35 percent, according to surveys done by INGOs.  Most </p><p>critically, the region is deficit in food.  Farmers in the </p><p>region have annually produced food sufficient to feed their </p><p>families for only four to five months each year.  For the </p><p>balance of the year, they fed their families with income from </p><p>opium. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) That income has now disappeared, and farmers have </p><p>begun to move seeking work.  Wages, in turn, have collapsed. </p><p>According to the mission, the wage for day labor in the </p><p>Kokang has dropped sixty percent in recent months from </p><p>approximately 10 Chinese yuan per day to only 4 yuan now (the </p><p>equivalent of about 50 cents).  Meanwhile, some families have </p><p>begun mortgaging property to meet current expenses; others </p><p>have moved to larger cities like Kutkai, Lashio, and Laukai </p><p>to beg.  Still others have begun to economize on </p><p>non-essential expenditures, like education.  According to the </p><p>mission, primary school attendance in the region has dropped </p><p>60 percent in 2003. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) The mission anticipates that this situation will grow </p><p>rapidly worse both this year and in years to come.  Farmers </p><p>in Shan State have not yet even begun to plant the monsoon </p><p>rice crop, which will not be harvested until October. Between </p><p>now and then, families will be left to cope on the basis of </p><p>whatever resources they can find.  The crisis will also </p><p>almost certainly expand as other regions go out of opium. </p><p>The population of the Kokang region is only 200,000; the </p><p>population of the Wa territories is 600,000 -- three times as </p><p>large.  As those territories end opium production, the </p><p>problems now evident in the Kokang and other areas of </p><p>northern Shan State could multiply. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Recommended Response </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) UNODC\'s assessment mission said that it is still </p><p>working out the details of a proposed response, but </p><p>anticipated that the cost of dealing with the consequences of </p><p>opium eradication would overwhelm the resources of the GOB </p><p>and of the cease-fire groups.  The entire budget of the </p><p>Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army, which ruled in the </p><p>Kokang, was only 8 million yuan (i.e.; $1 million) per year. </p><p>Similarly, while the Government of Burma claimed to have </p><p>pumped over 40 billion kyat (about USD 40 million) in to the </p><p>border regions over the past 14 years, this latest crisis was </p><p>only one of several facing it.  Both might try to provide </p><p>relief, but neither would be able to provide assistance on </p><p>the scale required. </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) The mission said that it would recommend basically two </p><p>programs: a 2-year program of humanitarian assistance and a </p><p>15-year program of alternative development assistance that </p><p>built on the experience gathered from the Wa Alternative </p><p>Development Program.  It had not yet put a dollar value on </p><p>the required assistance for either, but had at least </p><p>developed a package of 3 proposed interventions for the </p><p>emergency program and 20 proposed interventions for the first </p><p>five years of the 15-year program.  Once complete, the </p><p>15-year program would recommend a consolidation of project </p><p>activities around Mong Pawk and an extension of those </p><p>activites to areas in the Wa territories north of Pang Sang, </p><p>and to the Kokang. </p><p> </p><p>Opposition Leaders Concerned </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) The UNODC mission\'s evaluation of the situation in </p><p>northern Shan State was stark, but accurate.  Recently, </p><p>opposition party members in Kutkai, Lashio, and Muse, </p><p>including members of Aung San Suu Kyi\'s National League for </p><p>Democracy, called Poloff\'s attention to the plight of farmers </p><p>who were forced out of opium this year with little support </p><p>from the government other than a sporadic distribution of </p><p>seeds for alternative crops.  According to the political </p><p>parties, there is risk of starvation in this area. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Secondly, what the team found in northern Shan State </p><p>is only part of the story.  Much of the opium production in </p><p>northern Shan state has been eliminated; some, however, has </p><p>simply been pushed into other regions.  NLD members in Kachin </p><p>State in particular complained of large new areas of opium </p><p>production around Bhamo, and possibly as far north as the </p><p>Tanaing Valley north of Myitkyina.  Similarly, UNODC reports </p><p>that production in central Shan State from Keng Tung over to </p><p>Taunggyi and Pinlaung has also increased this year, partially </p><p>offsetting the decline in northern Shan State.  Overall, it </p><p>appears that opium cultivation will be down substantially in </p><p>Burma as a whole this year; however, progress has been </p><p>uneven.  In some areas, like northern Shan State, opium has </p><p>been virtually completely eradicated.  In others, more </p><p>acreage is under opium cultivation than has been the case for </p><p>some years. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) The fate of former opium farmers in Burma will depend </p><p>on how well donor nations respond to UNODC\'s appeal for </p><p>assistance for some of the poorest people in the world.  The </p><p>Japanese have indicated that they do intend to be heavily </p><p>involved in the Kokang.  The European Union has also lately </p><p>decided to provide $1.8 million for two INGOs (Aide Medicale </p><p>International and Maltheser) to work closely with UNODC on </p><p>the provision of basic health services in the Wa territories. </p><p> However, more will be needed.  In October 2002 (reftel), </p><p>UNODC put forward a proposed program of approximately $4 </p><p>million/year for alternative development in Burma.  That </p><p>program may be scaled up now on the basis of the assessment </p><p>report, but even so, the total scale of the program required </p><p>in Burma will be modest when measured against the need or </p><p>against the opportunity of shutting down one of world\'s </p><p>traditional centers of opium production.
