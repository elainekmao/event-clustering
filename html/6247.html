GODFREY FOR REASONS 1.5 (B,D) </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY AND INTRODUCTION </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) CROATIA\'S OPPOSITION HDZ HAS BEEN WORKING HARD TO </p><p>REHABILITATE ITSELF IN THE EYES OF VOTERS EVER SINCE IT WAS </p><p>EJECTED FROM POWER IN JANUARY 2000.  PARTY LEADERS CLAIM -- </p><p>LOUDLY AND OFTEN -- THAT THE HDZ IS COMPLETING ITS </p><p>"DEMOCRATIC TRANSFORMATION" FROM THE CORRUPT, NATIONALIST </p><p>PARTY FOUNDED BY FORMER PRESIDENT TUDJMAN.  BUT BEYOND A </p><p>STILL-INCOMPLETE POLITICAL PURGE AND THE APPLICATION OF A LOT </p><p>OF POLISH TO ITS FACADE, THE HDZ REMAINS UNRECONSTRUCTED AND </p><p>UNDEMOCRATIC, AND WHILE AN HDZ GOVERNMENT WOULD MOST LIKELY </p><p>BE MORE EFFICIENT THAN THE CURRENT COALITION, IT WOULD STILL </p><p>BE UNRELIABLE AND PROBABLY A HINDRANCE TO ACHIEVING OUR </p><p>REGIONAL STABILITY GOALS IN SOUTH-CENTRAL EUROPE. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) POLLS SHOW THAT CROATIA\'S VOTERS, APART FROM THE HDZ </p><p>FAITHFUL, ARE STILL HESITANT TO ACCEPT HDZ PRESIDENT </p><p>SANADER\'S DECLARATION THAT THE HDZ IS "NEW AND IMPROVED," </p><p>DESPITE THEIR FRUSTRATION WITH THE CURRENT LACKLUSTER </p><p>COALITION.  SANADER DESPERATELY SEEKS THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>COMMUNITY\'S VALIDATION SO HE CAN PUT TO REST THE WELL-PLACED </p><p>FEARS OF MANY CROATIANS THAT A RETURN OF THE HDZ TO POWER </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00519  01 OF 05  101728Z </p><p>WOULD HURT CROATIA\'S CHANCES TO JOIN THE EU AND NATO.  U.S. </p><p>ACCEPTANCE OF THE HDZ AS "NORMAL" IS CENTRAL TO SANADER\'S </p><p>STRATEGY.  FOR MORE THAN A YEAR, HE HAS SOUGHT TO CHANGE THE </p><p>USG POLICY OF ONLY MEETING HIM AT THE WORKING LEVEL.  OUR </p><p>POLICY OF KEEPING SANADER AT ARM\'S LENGTH IS WELL-KNOWN IN </p><p>CROATIAN POLITICAL CIRCLES. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) AS THE PRE-ELECTION CAMPAIGN IN CROATIA BEGINS TO </p><p>WARM UP, OUR ABILITY TO INFLUENCE SANADER IS AT ITS PEAK.  ON </p><p>FEBRUARY 21, THE AMBASSADOR MET PRIVATELY WITH SANADER FOR </p><p>THE FIRST TIME.  A POLISHED SALESMAN CONVINCED OF THE QUALITY </p><p>OF HIS "PRODUCT," SANADER TOUTED HIS "REFORM" RECORD AND DID </p><p>HIS BEST TO ESTABLISH REGULAR TIES WITH THE EMBASSY.  BUT THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR USED THE ONE-ON-ONE MEETING TO DELIVER A SHARP </p><p>MESSAGE OF WHAT THE HDZ MUST DO BEFORE THAT TAKES PLACE. </p><p>FROM COOPERATION WITH ICTY TO ACTIVELY SUPPORTING REFUGEE </p><p>RETURN AND TO RELATIONS WITH NEIGHBORS IN THE REGION, THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR LAID DOWN CLEAR EXPECTATIONS OF THE HDZ.  ON PARTY </p><p>REFORMS, HE PRESSED SANADER TO MOVE BEYOND POLITICALLY </p><p>EXPEDIENT PERSONNEL CHANGES AND DEMONSTRATE COMMITMENT TO </p><p>REFORM BY ADDRESSING COMPREHENSIVELY THE HDZ\'S LEGACY OF </p><p>CORRUPTION AND ETHNIC WAR AND BY ENSURING LOCAL HDZ LEADERS </p><p>HEW TO A PUBLICLY-DECLARED, MORE PROGRESSIVE HDZ POLICY. </p><p>SANADER CLAIMED HE WAS ON TRACK TO MAKE FURTHER CHANGES TO </p><p>THE HDZ AND DEMONSTRATE ITS COMMITMENT TO PROGRESS IN THE </p><p>REGION.  WE WILL HAVE TO SEE AND INSIST ON RESULTS BEFORE WE </p><p>GIVE HIM THE VALIDATION HE SEEKS.  OUR FIRST REAL OPPORTUNITY </p><p>TO SEE RESULTS WILL LIKELY NOT COME BEFORE THE NEXT ELECTION </p><p>CAMPAIGN IS OVER.  END SUMMARY AND INTRODUCTION. </p><p> </p><p>HDZ: HOSTAGE TO HISTORY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00519  01 OF 05  101728Z </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) THE CROATIAN DEMOCRATIC UNION (HDZ) HAS FOR MOST OF </p><p>THE PAST TWO YEARS BEEN CROATIA\'S HIGHEST-POLLING POLITICAL </p><p>PARTY (AROUND 20 PERCENT, PLUS OR MINUS THREE).  BUT EVEN AS </p><p>THE COALITION PARTIES HAVE FALTERED, PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR THE </p><p>HDZ HAS NOT GROWN BEYOND 25 PERCENT.  THIS SUGGESTS THAT FEW </p><p>VOTERS OUTSIDE THOSE ALWAYS FAITHFUL TO THE HDZ BRAND ARE </p><p>READY TO TRUST THE PARTY, EVEN THREE YEARS AFTER IT WAS VOTED </p><p>OUT.  ALTHOUGH TUDJMAN\'S HDZ SECURED CROATIA\'S FUTURE AS AN </p><p>INDEPENDENT STATE, IT ALSO BROUGHT THE COUNTRY TO THE BRINK </p><p>OF FINANCIAL RUIN AND INTERNATIONAL ISOLATION, LEAVING IT FAR </p><p>BEHIND RIVALS IN THE RACE FOR THE PRIZES OF MEMBERSHIP IN THE </p><p>EU AND NATO.  VOTERS SEEM TO REMEMBER ALL THAT. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) DURING THE TUDJMAN ERA, THE HDZ VIEWED ITSELF MORE AS </p><p>A POLITICAL MOVEMENT THAN A POLITICAL PARTY.  ALL "GOOD </p><p>CROATS," REGARDLESS OF THEIR POLITICAL ORIENTATION, WERE </p><p>SUPPOSED TO UNITE IN THE HDZ TO BATTLE FOR CROATIA\'S </p><p>INDEPENDENCE AGAINST ALL ENEMIES, FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC, </p><p>PERCEIVED OR INVENTED.  OPPOSITION TO THE HDZ WAS LABELLED AS </p><p>"COMMUNIST" AND LEADERS CALLING FOR REGIONAL COOPERATION WERE </p><p>ACCUSED OF TRYING TO RECONSTITUTE YUGOSLAVIA.  THIS </p><p>SIMPLISTIC UNDERSTANDING OF POLITICS PERSISTS IN SOME </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ8989 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  00519  02 OF 05  101729Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AF-00    AID-00   CIAE-00  INL-00   DODE-00 </p><p>      DOTE-00  PERC-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    FAAE-00  FBIE-00 </p><p>      VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    L-00     VCE-00   MOFM-05 </p><p>      MOF-01   AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01 </p><p>      PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SCT-00   SP-00 </p><p>      IRM-00   STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  EPAE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00 </p><p>      PRM-00   DRL-01   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00    /012W </p><p>                  ------------------41E985  101729Z /38 </p><p>P 101716Z MAR 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 9643 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY BELGRADE PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY BUDAPEST PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY LJUBLJANA PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY SARAJEVO PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY SKOPJE PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY SOFIA PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY TIRANA PRIORITY </p><p>USEU BRUSSELS PRIORITY </p><p>USMISSION USOSCE PRIORITY </p><p>USMISSION USNATO PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 05 ZAGREB 000519 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EUR (BOGUE) AND EUR/SCE (NARDI) </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/06/2013 </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00519  02 OF 05  101729Z </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PREF, PHUM, HR </p><p>SUBJECT: SANADER\'S HDZ: RATINGS UP, BUT STILL NOT READY FOR </p><p>PRIME TIME </p><p> </p><p>OBSERVERS, AND CAN STILL BE SEEN IN HARDLINE COMMENTARY LIKE </p><p>THAT OF "WASHINGTON TIMES" COLUMNIST JEFFREY KUHNER.  HDZ </p><p>PRESIDENT IVO SANADER HAS, SINCE HE WAS FIRST ELECTED AS </p><p>PARTY PRESIDENT AFTER THE HDZ\'S CRUSHING ELECTORAL DEFEAT IN </p><p>JANUARY 2000, SOUGHT TO RE-MAKE HIS PARTY AS A "NORMAL" </p><p>CENTER-RIGHT POLITICAL OPTION.  BUT IN HIS FIRST TERM AS HDZ </p><p>PRESIDENT, SANADER MADE CHANGES ONLY TO THE PARTY\'S IMAGE, </p><p>BLAMING STRONG INTERNAL OPPOSITION FROM RIVAL AND TOP TUDJMAN </p><p>HENCHMAN IVIC PASALIC. </p><p> </p><p>CLEANING HOUSE AND SETTLING POLITICAL ACCOUNTS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) WHEN SANADER DEFEATED PASALIC AND WAS RE-ELECTED TO </p><p>THE PARTY PRESIDENCY IN APRIL 2002, HE BEGAN A SERIES OF </p><p>POLITICAL PURGES IN THE HDZ TO ROOT OUT THOSE SENIOR MEMBERS </p><p>AT THE CENTRAL AND LOCAL LEVELS STILL LOYAL TO PASALIC.  THIS </p><p>CULMINATED IN THE EJECTION OF PASALIC LATER IN 2002 AND OF </p><p>SEVERAL LOCAL PARTY COMMITTEES THAT WOULD NOT TOE THE LINE. </p><p>BUT WHILE MOST OF THOSE WHO FOLLOWED PASALIC OUT THE DOOR (OR </p><p>WERE PUSHED OUT) WERE FROM THE HDZ\'S MOST EXTREME NATIONALIST </p><p>WING, THE PURGES WERE CONDUCTED SOLELY FOR REASONS OF LOYALTY </p><p>TO SANADER\'S LEADERSHIP, NOT IDEOLOGY.  MANY OF THE HDZ\'S </p><p>NATIONALIST DINOSAURS REMAIN WITH SANADER. </p><p> </p><p>HDZ\'S SIGHTS SET ON NEXT ELECTION </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00519  02 OF 05  101729Z </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) WITH HIS INTERNAL BATTLES BEHIND HIM AND THE SUPPORT </p><p>OF A FEW SLICK, MODERN POLITICAL OPERATORS (LIKE FORMER </p><p>AMBASSADOR TO THE U.S. MIOMIR ZUZUL AND HDZ VICE PRESIDENT </p><p>JADRANKA KOSOR), SANADER NOW HAS HIS SIGHTS FIRMLY ON THE </p><p>NEXT ELECTIONS.  WITH THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT FLOUNDERING FROM </p><p>CRISIS TO CRISIS (MOST CREATED BY THEIR OWN INTERNAL </p><p>BICKERING), THE HDZ OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO TAKE A COMMANDING </p><p>LEAD IN THE POLLS. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) HOWEVER, THE HDZ CONTINUES TO POLL IN THE RANGE OF 23 </p><p>PERCENT, AHEAD OF PM RACAN\'S SDP, BUT STUBBORNLY FAR BELOW </p><p>THE LEVEL REQUIRED TO BE ABLE TO GOVERN BY ITSELF.  SANADER\'S </p><p>TASK IS SIMPLE TO UNDERSTAND, BUT HARD TO ACHIEVE: TO RETURN </p><p>TO GOVERNMENT, THE HDZ NEEDS EITHER TO CONVINCE MORE VOTERS </p><p>TO BACK HIS PARTY OR TO CONVINCE OTHER POLITICAL PARTIES THAT </p><p>HIS HDZ WOULD BE A TRUSTWORTHY PARTNER IN COALITION.  AND HE </p><p>HAS TO DO THIS WHILE KEEPING THE NATIONALIST RIGHT-WING CORE </p><p>OF HIS HDZ FIRMLY IN HIS CAMP. </p><p> </p><p>HDZ NEEDS USG SEAL OF APPROVAL TO CONVINCE UNDECIDEDS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) ONE RECENT RELIABLE POLL SHOWS THAT NEARLY 40 PERCENT </p><p>OF THOSE WHO INTEND TO VOTE IN THE NEXT ELECTION HAVE NOT </p><p>MADE UP THEIR MINDS.  SANADER BELIEVES CROATIA\'S UNDECIDED </p><p>VOTERS ARE LOOKING TO THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO JUDGE </p><p>WHETHER THE HDZ HAS BECOME A PARTY CAPABLE OF GOVERNING THEIR </p><p>COUNTRY OUTSIDE OF WARTIME.  WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE KONRAD </p><p>ADENAUER FOUNDATION AND SOME CONSERVATIVE EU PARTIES </p><p>AFFILIATED WITH THE EUROPEAN PEOPLE\'S PARTY, OTHER IC LEADERS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00519  02 OF 05  101729Z </p><p>HAVE TAKEN THE SAME LINE AS WE HAVE, KEEPING THE HDZ AT ARM\'S </p><p>LENGTH UNTIL IT DEMONSTRATES -- ON THE ISSUES THAT MATTER, </p><p>NOT JUST PERSONNEL -- THAT IT HAS CHANGED. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) WE HAD BEEN WEIGHING FOR SOME TIME A MEETING WITH </p><p>SANADER TO EXPLAIN WHERE THE HDZ NEEDS TO CHANGE; AS THE </p><p>PRE-ELECTION CAMPAIGN IN CROATIA BEGINS TO WARM UP, OUR </p><p>ABILITY TO INFLUENCE SANADER IS AT ITS PEAK.  THERE IS ALSO </p><p>LESS TO LOSE: AS THE COALITION PARTIES ARE INCREASINGLY </p><p>SEIZED WITH ELECTIONS, THE GOVERNMENT HAS ALL BUT STOPPED </p><p>TAKING UNPOPULAR STEPS ON SOME OF THE ISSUES WE CONSIDER MOST </p><p>IMPORTANT, LIKE REFUGEE RETURN. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) SANADER\'S RECENT CLEAR AND POSITIVE STATEMENTS ON </p><p>IRAQ INFLUENCED THE TIMING OF OUR MEETING, WHICH WAS TAKEN </p><p>(AS INTENDED) BY THE GOC AS A SHOT ACROSS ITS BOW.  OUR AIM </p><p>WAS TO PROD PM RACAN INTO TAKING A MORE CONSTRUCTIVE LINE ON </p><p>PROVIDING LOGISTICS SUPPORT TO CIVILIAN AIRCRAFT CARRYING </p><p>U.S. TROOPS TO THE MIDEAST.  ALTHOUGH THE DETAILS OF THE </p><p>MEETING WITH SANADER REMAIN OUT OF THE PRESS -- AS AGREED -- </p><p>WE LEAKED NEWS OF THE MEETING TO THE SDP, EXPLAINING THAT THE </p><p>HDZ\'S STANCE SUPPORTING USG CALLS FOR ACTION ON IRAQ WAS ONE </p><p>OF THE REASONS.  PM RACAN ANNOUNCED HIS GOVERNMENT\'S DECISION </p><p>TO APPROVE USG LOGISTICS REQUESTS SOON AFTER.

(C) ON FEBRUARY 21, THE AMBASSADOR MET PRIVATELY WITH </p><p>SANADER AT THE RESIDENCE.  THE AMBASSADOR OPENED THE MEETING </p><p>BY THANKING SANADER FOR HIS STRONG STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF </p><p>THE USG POSITION ON IRAQ.  SANADER TOLD THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>CONVINCINGLY THAT THIS WAS NOT JUST HIS, BUT HIS PARTY\'S </p><p>POSITION, TAKEN NOT TO GAIN FAVOR WITH THE U.S., BUT BECAUSE </p><p>THE HDZ BELIEVES IT IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO.  HE KNOWS THE </p><p>POSITION RUNS AGAINST PUBLIC OPINION.  THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>EXPRESSED APPRECIATION FOR SANADER\'S VIEW, BUT UNDERSCORED </p><p>THAT IRAQ IS IN A CATEGORY OF ISSUES THAT SHOULD BE ABOVE </p><p>POLITICS.  WE HAD INTERPRETED THE HDZ\'S FEBRUARY 19 VOTE </p><p>AGAINST THE GOC DECISION TO SUPPORT THE VILNIUS-10 DECISION </p><p>IN A SABOR COMMITTEE AS PLAYING POLITICS WITH THE ISSUE. </p><p>SANADER WAS DEFENSIVE, SAYING THAT THE COMMITTEE VOTE WAS NOT </p><p>ON THE POLICY, PER SE, BUT TO APPROVE A GOVERNMENT REPORT </p><p>ABOUT THE POLICY, A REPORT WITH WHICH HIS PARTY DID NOT FULLY </p><p>AGREE SINCE IT FELT THE GOC WAS MISHANDLING THE IRAQ ISSUE. </p><p> </p><p>AMB: NO BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT FOR HDZ </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR THEN DESCRIBED FOR SANADER WHY HE HAS </p><p>BEEN HESITANT TO ENGAGE WITH THE HDZ AND WHY THE USG WILL NOT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00519  03 OF 05  101729Z </p><p>TAKE HIS PARTY\'S ASSERTIONS AT FACE VALUE.  WE HAVE A LONG </p><p>MEMORY.  THE AMBASSADOR NOTED THAT HE PERSONALLY WAS INVOLVED </p><p>IN SOUTH CENTRAL EUROPE WHEN THE POLICIES THE HDZ GOVERNMENT </p><p>WAS IMPLEMENTING WERE WORKING IN DIRECT OPPOSITION TO U.S. </p><p>GOALS FOR REGIONAL STABILITY IN THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA.  THE </p><p>HDZ GOVERNMENT HAD BEEN USEFUL TO US ON SOME FOREIGN AFFAIRS </p><p>ISSUES, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT CAME TO SUPPORTING NATO AIR WAR </p><p>AGAINST THE FRY, BUT ON ALMOST EVERY OTHER ISSUE -- FOR </p><p>EXAMPLE THE TUDJMAN GOVERNMENT\'S DISRUPTIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH </p><p>CROATS IN BOSNIA, ITS ACTIVE OBSTRUCTION OF THE RETURN OF </p><p>ETHNIC SERBS TO THEIR HOMES IN CROATIA, ITS OBSTRUCTION OF </p><p>COOPERATION WITH ICTY AND, OF COURSE, ITS PERVASIVE </p><p>CORRUPTION AND CRONY CAPITALISM -- THE HDZ HAD BEEN ON THE </p><p>WRONG SIDE.  THIS HISTORY WOULD CONTINUE TO COLOR THE </p><p>EMBASSY\'S RECOMMENDATION TO WASHINGTON ON HOW TO ENGAGE WITH </p><p>THE HDZ. </p><p> </p><p>FINISH YOUR "PURGE" -- GET RID OF GLAVAS AND ROJS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR TOLD SANADER THAT WE HAD BEEN </p><p>FOLLOWING THE PERSONNEL CHANGES IN HDZ CLOSELY.  WHILE THE </p><p>DEPARTURE OF PASALIC AND SOME OF HIS CLOSEST ASSOCIATES WAS A </p><p>GOOD THING, THERE WAS MUCH MORE HOUSECLEANING TO DO.  RETIRED </p><p>GENERAL LJUBO CESIC-ROJS IS A CARICATURE OF THE TUDJMAN HDZ, </p><p>STILL TRYING TO DISGUISE HIS SMUGGLING AND ILLEGAL GAINS WITH </p><p>PATRIOTIC STATEMENTS AND WITH ONE FOOT IN HERZEGOVINA.  WORSE </p><p>STILL, OSIJEK STRONGMAN BRANIMIR GLAVAS, WAS STILL ONE OF </p><p>SANADER\'S MOST TRUSTED ADVISERS.  (INDEED, MANY ARGUE THAT </p><p>GLAVAS\' VOTE-RIGGING AT THE LAST HDZ CONVENTION KEPT SANADER </p><p>IN CONTROL OF THE PARTY.)  THE AMBASSADOR RECALLED IN DETAIL </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00519  03 OF 05  101729Z </p><p>GLAVAS\' ROLE IN CLOSE LEAGUE WITH FORMER DEFENSE MINISTER </p><p>SUSAK THAT HELPED SPARK WAR IN 1991 IN THE MURDER OF OSIJEK </p><p>POLICE CHIEF RIEHL-KIR AND THE BOROVO SELO ATTACK.  AS LONG </p><p>AS GLAVAS WAS IN THE HDZ, THE AMBASSADOR TOLD SANADER, WE </p><p>WOULD NOT TAKE IT (OR HIM) SERIOUSLY. </p><p> </p><p>NO ROOM FOR POLITICAL MANEUVER ON COOPERATION WITH ICTY </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p> </p><p>15.  (C) ON ICTY COOPERATION, THE AMBASSADOR SAID THERE IS NO </p><p>ROOM FOR COMPROMISE.  IF THE HDZ WANTS THE RESPECT OF THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, IT MUST SHOW RESPECT TO ITS </p><p>INSTITUTIONS.

(C) THE AMBASSADOR TOLD SANADER THAT REFUGEE RETURN AND </p><p>REINTEGRATION IS AN ISSUE WHERE THE HDZ CAN SHOW WHETHER IT </p><p>IS REFORMED WITHOUT WAITING FOR ELECTIONS.  HE CALLED ON </p><p>SANADER TO BACK UP HIS POSITIVE PRIVATE STATEMENTS WELCOMING </p><p>RETURN WITH PUBLIC POLICY STATEMENTS TO PARTY MEMBERS, </p><p>INSISTING THAT THEY ENCOURAGE LAWFUL RETURN.  THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>URGED SANADER TO CALL ON HDZ MAYORS AND COUNTY PREFECTS TO </p><p>COOPERATE WITH THE GOVERNMENT AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY </p><p>TO FACILITATE REFUGEE RETURN.  THE AMBASSADOR POINTED OUT </p><p>THAT SOME HDZ OFFICIALS, EVEN IN AREAS WHERE THE EFFECTS OF </p><p>THE WAR ARE STILL STRONGLY FELT, ARE SUPPORTING RETURNS; THE </p><p>USG IS PLEASED TO HAVE ENTERED INTO SUCCESSFUL PARTNERSHIP </p><p>RELATIONSHIPS WITH SOME MUNICIPALITIES WHERE HDZ HOLDS A </p><p>MAJORITY.  IN THE FIELD, READINESS TO MOVE FORWARD IS A MORE </p><p>IMPORTANT CRITERIA FOR SELECTION IN THESE PROGRAMS THAN PARTY </p><p>AFFILIATION, THE AMBASSADOR SAID.  BUT THE WORST </p><p>OBSTRUCTIONIST MAYORS WERE DISPROPORTIONATELY HDZ.  SANADER </p><p>NEEDED TO LEAD HIS PARTY TO BE CONSTRUCTIVE EVERYWHERE IT </p><p>GOVERNED. </p><p> </p><p>SANADER: "HEY, WE\'RE NOT ALL BAD" </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>17.  (C) SANADER THANKED THE AMBASSADOR FOR HIS FRANK </p><p>MESSAGES; HE SAID HE GENUINELY APPRECIATED THE USG\'S </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00519  04 OF 05  101730Z </p><p>UNVARNISHED VIEW OF WHERE THE HDZ STOOD.  WHILE HE </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE HDZ HAS ITS "WARTS," SANADER SAID HE IS </p><p>NEVERTHELESS PROUD OF HIS PARTY.  PRESIDENT TUDJMAN WAS A </p><p>STATESMAN WHOSE CONTRIBUTION WILL BE RECOGNIZED BY HISTORY. </p><p>SANADER SAID HE KNOWS HIS PARTY\'S TRANSFORMATION IS </p><p>INCOMPLETE; THE HDZ STILL HAS A WAYS TO GO BEFORE IT BECOMES </p><p>THE RESPONSIBLE, CENTER-RIGHT PARTY HE HOPES TO CREATE. </p><p> </p><p>18.  (C) HE TOLD THE AMBASSADOR THAT WHEN HE WAS ELECTED </p><p>PARTY PRESIDENT IN APRIL 2000, IT WAS STILL TUDJMAN\'S HDZ </p><p>THAT HE TOOK OVER, VERY MUCH A WARTIME PARTY.  DESPITE </p><p>PASALIC\'S DEPARTURE WITH A FEW OF HIS FAITHFUL, THE </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY CAUCUS WAS AND IS STILL FULL OF "LITTLE </p><p>TUDJMANS," MANY OF WHOM DO NOT SHARE THE IDEOLOGY OF THE </p><p>PARTY SANADER SEEKS TO DEVELOP.  UNTIL THESE PEOPLE LEAVE THE </p><p>PARTY, THE HDZ WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE MANY OF THE </p><p>CHARACTERISTICS OF A NATIONAL MOVEMENT RATHER THAN A </p><p>MAINSTREAM POLITICAL PARTY. </p><p> </p><p>19.  (C) SANADER HOPES TO ADDRESS THE HDZ\'S LACK OF TOLERANCE </p><p>AND TRANSPARENCY BY CHANGING THE PEOPLE AT THE TOP OF THE </p><p>PARTY WITH MORE PROGRESSIVE, YOUNGER PARTY MEMBERS.  WITH THE </p><p>WIN OVER PASALIC IN 2002, SANADER CLAIMED HE NOW HAS COMPLETE </p><p>CONTROL OF THE NATIONAL LEVEL ELECTORAL LISTS.  HE </p><p>"GUARANTEED" THE AMBASSADOR THAT FULLY 80 PERCENT OF THE </p><p>CURRENT PARLIAMENTARY CAUCUS WOULD BE OUT OF THE SABOR AFTER </p><p>THE NEXT ELECTION.  HE CLAIMED THAT ROJS WAS ALREADY ON THE </p><p>WAY OUT.  HE DID NOT TAKE ON THE AMBASSADOR\'S DENUNCIATION OF </p><p>GLAVAS BY NAME, BUT ARGUED THAT EASTERN SLAVONIA (LITERALLY, </p><p>GLAVAS\' STOMPING GROUND) IS A "DIFFICULT" AREA WHERE "THERE </p><p>ARE STILL MANY WAR WOUNDS."  ON RETURNS, SANADER CLAIMED THAT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00519  04 OF 05  101730Z </p><p>HIS PARTY\'S POLICY IS THAT ALL WHO WISH TO RETURN SHOULD BE </p><p>ABLE TO DO SO.  HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE ISSUE IS NOT </p><p>ADDRESSED IN A UNIFORM WAY BY HDZ LOCAL LEADERS.  SANADER </p><p>EXPLAINED THAT ONE OF THE WAYS HE IS "DEMOCRATIZING" THE HDZ </p><p>IS TO PUSH RESPONSIBILITY FOR ISSUES DOWN TO THE LOCAL LEVEL; </p><p>IN DOING SO HE GIVES UP A MEASURE OF CONTROL OVER LOCAL </p><p>OFFICIALS\' BEHAVIOR. </p><p> </p><p>20.  (C) NEVERTHELESS, SANADER POINTED OUT THE HDZ HAS </p><p>RECENTLY TAKEN SOME POLICY POSITIONS WHICH SHOW PROGRESS.  HE </p><p>TOOK CREDIT FOR THE HDZ\'S SUBSTANTIVE CONTRIBUTION TO </p><p>CROATIA\'S PROGRESSIVE NEW CONSTITUTIONAL LAW ON NATIONAL </p><p>MINORITIES, FOR ITS VOTE IN THE SABOR TO APPROVE THE </p><p>DEPLOYMENT OF A CROATIAN MILITARY POLICE UNIT TO AFGHANISTAN </p><p>AND HIS PARTY\'S PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR THE GOVERNMENT\'S LAUNCH OF </p><p>CROATIA\'S APPLICATION FOR EU MEMBERSHIP. </p><p> </p><p>21.  (C) SANADER SAID HE WAS PROUD OF THE HDZ RECORD IN </p><p>SUPPORTING CONSTRUCTIVE RELATIONS WITH CROATIA\'S NEIGHBORS. </p><p>THE HDZ HAS BROKEN TIES WITH THE HDZ-BIH, HE ASSERTED, AND </p><p>SUPPORTED THE GOC POLICY OF PROPER STATE-TO-STATE RELATIONS. </p><p>HE SAID THAT THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD WORK HARDER TO RESOLVE </p><p>OUTSTANDING BORDER ISSUES WITH SERBIA-MONTENEGRO.  SANADER </p><p>SAID HE UNDERSTANDS THE COMPLEXITY OF THE BORDER ISSUES (HE </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ8999 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  00519  05 OF 05  101730Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AF-00    AID-00   CIAE-00  INL-00   DODE-00 </p><p>      PERC-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    FBIE-00  VC-00    TEDE-00 </p><p>      INR-00   IO-00    L-00     VCE-00   MOFM-05  MOF-01   AC-01 </p><p>      NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  CAEX-01  PA-00 </p><p>      PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SCT-00   SP-00    IRM-00 </p><p>      STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-01 </p><p>      G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00    /013W </p><p>                  ------------------41E9CC  101730Z /38 </p><p>P 101716Z MAR 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 9646 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY BELGRADE PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY BUDAPEST PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY LJUBLJANA PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY SARAJEVO PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY SKOPJE PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY SOFIA PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY TIRANA PRIORITY </p><p>USEU BRUSSELS PRIORITY </p><p>USMISSION USOSCE PRIORITY </p><p>USMISSION USNATO PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 05 OF 05 ZAGREB 000519 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EUR (BOGUE) AND EUR/SCE (NARDI) </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/06/2013 </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00519  05 OF 05  101730Z </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PREF, PHUM, HR </p><p>SUBJECT: SANADER\'S HDZ: RATINGS UP, BUT STILL NOT READY FOR </p><p>PRIME TIME </p><p> </p><p>MENTIONED THAT HE HAD ALREADY MET WITH THE SERBIA-MONTENEGRO </p><p>AMBASSADOR TO CROATIA), BUT ARGUED THAT WHILE IT MAY TAKE </p><p>TIME TO RESOLVE THESE ISSUES, IT ALSO TAKES LEADERSHIP, </p><p>LARGELY ABSENT IN THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT.  (IN A LATER </p><p>MEETING WITH THE AMBASSADOR, S-M AMBASSADOR SIMURDIC </p><p>CHARACTERIZED HIS MEETING WITH SANADER IN LESS POSITIVE </p><p>TERMS.) </p><p> </p><p>22.  (C) SANADER WAS EAGER TO SET A DATE FOR A FUTURE MEETING </p><p>WITH THE AMBASSADOR, AND SAID HE WOULD AGREE ON ANY TERMS </p><p>PROPOSED.  HE ALSO SOUGHT TO ESTABLISH MORE REGULAR CONTACT </p><p>WITH THE EMBASSY.  ON THE ISSUE OF REFUGEE RETURN, HE </p><p>PROPOSED SETTING UP A WORKING GROUP OF EXPERTS FROM THE HDZ </p><p>AND THE EMBASSY TO DISCUSS WAYS TO MOVE THE ISSUE FORWARD. </p><p>THE AMBASSADOR PARRIED THE IDEA OF WORKING GROUPS ON THIS </p><p>ISSUE AND ON ICTY, PREFERRING TO CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE </p><p>HDZ\'S "REFORM" AND THEN SEEK TO ENGAGE WITH SANADER FOR </p><p>FUTURE MEETINGS BASED ON THE PARTY\'S FORWARD PROGRESS. </p><p> </p><p>23.  (C)  BY AND LARGE, SANADER STUCK TO THE "NO PRESS" </p><p>GROUND RULES SET UP IN ADVANCE, ALTHOUGH OUR BACK-CHANNEL </p><p>MESSAGE (SEE PARA 11 ABOVE) DID GENERATE SOME PRESS INTEREST </p><p>ABOUT A "SECRET" MEETING BETWEEN SANADER AND AN EMBASSY </p><p>"SENIOR OFFICIAL."  SANADER PUBLISHED A MAJOR INTERVIEW ON </p><p>MARCH 1 IN WHICH HE ADDRESSED SOME OF THE AMBASSADOR\'S </p><p>CONCERNS, BUT MISSED IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITIES TO DEMONSTRATE </p><p>HIS PARTY\'S COMMITMENT TO THE GOALS OUTLINED BY THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00519  05 OF 05  101730Z </p><p>AMBASSADOR DURING THEIR MEETING.  AS HE HAS IN THE PAST, HE </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGED THE HDZ\'S FAILURE TO CURB RAMPANT CORRUPTION </p><p>DURING THE TUDJMAN REGIME.  ON ICTY, HE SPOKE OUT OF BOTH </p><p>SIDES OF HIS MOUTH IN THE SAME INTERVIEW.  WHILE HE SAID THAT </p><p>"ALL UN MEMBER STATES MUST COOPERATE WITH THE TRIBUNAL" AND </p><p>VOWED TO USE LEGAL CHALLENGES WHICH CROATIA HAS A RIGHT TO </p><p>PURSUE, HE "REJECTED THE UNACCEPTABLE POLITICAL </p><p>QUALIFICATIONS" IN THE GOTOVINA INDICTMENT AND DECLARED THAT </p><p>THE HDZ WOULD STICK TO THIS POSITION.  (TO BE FAIR, THE GOC </p><p>DOES LITTLE BETTER.) </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>24.  (C) SANADER, CLEARLY ONE OF CROATIA\'S NATURAL SALESMEN, </p><p>STRIKES US AS PERSONALLY GENUINE, BUT IT IS ALSO CLEAR THAT </p><p>HE IS NOT COMMITTED TO ANYTHING BUT RETURNING THE HDZ TO </p><p>GOVERNMENT.  SANADER KNOWS THAT HIS ACHILLES\' HEEL IS THE </p><p>ABILITY OF POLITICAL OPPONENTS IN THE CURRENT COALITION TO </p><p>CONVINCE CROATIANS THAT A VOTE FOR THE HDZ IS A VOTE AGAINST </p><p>MEMBERSHIP IN THE EU.  THAT MEANS THIS PRE-ELECTION PERIOD IS </p><p>OUR BEST OPPORTUNITY TO GET SANADER AT LEAST TO MAKE </p><p>STATEMENTS (EVEN IF ACTIONS WOULD BE UNREALISTIC TO EXPECT) </p><p>IN SUPPORT OF OUR REGIONAL STABILITY GOALS. </p><p> </p><p>25.  (C) OUR MEETING WITH SANDER DOES NOT MEAN THAT WE ARE </p><p>ANY CLOSER TO RECOGNIZING THE HDZ AS A VIABLE DEMOCRATIC </p><p>OPTION FOR CROATIA.  WE WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE THIS POINT </p><p>PRIVATELY TO OTHER POLITICAL LEADERS IN CROATIA.  OUR </p><p>RAMPED-UP ELECTION-YEAR DEMOCRACY-BUILDING ASSISTANCE </p><p>CONTINUES TO BE AIMED AT SUPPORTING THE HDZ\'S POTENTIAL </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00519  05 OF 05  101730Z </p><p>OPPONENTS BY HELPING THEM IDENTIFY RESONANT CAMPAIGN THEMES </p><p>AND BY GETTING OUT THE VOTE -- EVERY VOTER WHO NEEDS TO BE </p><p>GOTTEN OUT IS A COALITION VOTER; HDZ IS A SOLID BLOC. </p><p> </p><p>26.  (C) THE NEXT STEP IS UP TO SANADER\'S HDZ.  WE SET CLEAR </p><p>BENCHMARKS.  SANADER\'S COMMITMENT TO REFORM BOTH ON POLICY </p><p>ISSUES AND ON TRANSFORMING THE HDZ INTO A DEMOCRATIC PARTY </p><p>SHOULD BE RELATIVELY EASY TO GAUGE, BOTH BY HIS PUBLIC </p><p>STATEMENTS AND IN THE CANDIDATES THE HDZ PUTS UP FOR THE NEXT </p><p>ELECTION.  FOR CROATIA TO BECOME A FULLY FUNCTIONAL </p><p>DEMOCRACY, THE HDZ NEEDS TO BECOME A NORMAL POLITICAL PARTY </p><p>WHICH VOTERS COULD CHOOSE AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE CURRENT </p><p>LINEUP.  THIS MEETING WAS A FIRST SERIOUS EFFORT TO ENGAGE </p><p>AND TEST SANADER\'S WILLINGNESS AND ABILITY TO EFFECT THAT </p><p>CHANGE.  WE REMAIN FROM MISSOURI AS TO THE CHANGES HE WILL DO </p><p>SO. </p><p>ROSSIN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
