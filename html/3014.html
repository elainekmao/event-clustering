<p>UNCLAS ABUJA 001592 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR INL, AF, AND L/LEI </p><p>. </p><p>DOJ FOR OIA--JASON CARTER </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: CJAN, KCRM, SNAR, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA:  GOVERNMENT EXPEDITES EXTRADITION CASE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. LAGOS 887 </p><p>     B. STATE 69699 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.(SBU) A High Court judge on May 20 ruled in the </p><p>Government\'s favor on the extradition case of Gabriel Umoh, a </p><p>Nigerian national convicted by a U.S. court of financial </p><p>fraud.  According to the Ministry of Justice prosecutor, the </p><p>defense attorney argued before the court that the offense </p><p>allegedly committed by Mr. Umoh is not an offense covered in </p><p>the Extradition Treaty with the U.S.  Not persuaded by this </p><p>argument, the judge ruled that Umoh should be extradited. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.(SBU) Umoh\'s attorney has 15 days to appeal the ruling to </p><p>the Appellate Court.  The MOJ prosecutor is certain that Umoh </p><p>will appeal, and predicts this will take two-three months if </p><p>the judge is efficient and does not entertain repeated </p><p>defense motions for postponement or shift in court venue. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.(SBU) Comment:  The otherwise sluggish Nigerian judicial </p><p>system has showed remarkable pace in moving Umoh\'s </p><p>extradition case in just four weeks; arguments closed on May </p><p>13.  Nigeria\'s new Attorney General has told Ambassador Jeter </p><p>that he considers extradition of fugitives from Nigeria back </p><p>to the U.S. a priority.  It appears he helped select the </p><p>court and may have lobbied the Chief Judge of the High Court </p><p>for an honest and efficient judge to preside over this case. </p><p>The challenge will be to ensure that similar efficiency and </p><p>integrity continues in the Appellate Court. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
