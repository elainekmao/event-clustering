<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L COLOMBO 001197 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  07/09/13 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, ECON, ETRD, MV, Maldives </p><p>SUBJECT:  Maldives:  Let Us Not Take This Friend For </p><p>Granted </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  A) STATE 184643, B) EMB/DESK FAX, JULY 2, 2003 </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Donald A. Camp, Charge d\'Affaires. </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b, d) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  The Government of the Republic of </p><p>Maldives has made only one substantive request of us </p><p>this past year -- to defer until later this year a </p><p>decision on whether to graduate the Maldives from LDC </p><p>status.  Embassy strongly believes meeting this modest </p><p>request will go a long way towards reassuring the </p><p>Maldives that their recent helpfulness to us (Article 98 </p><p>signature, support for the war on terrorism) is not </p><p>unrequited.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) The GoRM has requested that the USG again </p><p>support the Maldivian effort to be retained on the LDC </p><p>list during the upcoming 2003 Substantive Session of the </p><p>Economic and Social Council. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Embassy believes that, in addition to the valid </p><p>economic vulnerability arguments, the Department should </p><p>consider closely the overall U.S.-GoRM relationship as </p><p>it decides how to respond to this request.  The GoRM </p><p>does not ask us for much and this is clearly a critical </p><p>issue for them. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Though we enjoy a high level of ongoing </p><p>cooperation on many levels, Department should consider </p><p>especially these specific examples: </p><p> </p><p>--  The Maldives was one of the first countries in the </p><p>world to agree to an Article 98 agreement, when they </p><p>were told it was an important USG priority. </p><p> </p><p>--  The Maldives has always supported the U.S. in its </p><p>counter-terrorism efforts, not always an easy task for a </p><p>member of the Islamic Conference (OIC). </p><p> </p><p>--  The Maldives maintains an excellent military-to- </p><p>military relationship with the U.S. </p><p> </p><p>--  The Maldives, astride 1000 miles of Indian Ocean air </p><p>and sea lanes, and just north of the U.S. base at Diego </p><p>Garcia, was quick to offer the U.S. unlimited overflight </p><p>rights after 9/11. </p><p> </p><p>--  The Maldivian Monetary Authority (Central Bank) </p><p>responds quickly and thoroughly to all messages from us </p><p>on controlling terrorist financing. </p><p> </p><p>--  The U.S. is committed to improving our ties to </p><p>moderate Islamic states.  The Maldives is a prime </p><p>example of such a nation, in a volatile region. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) COMMENT:  The Maldives is a nation whose </p><p>assistance we may need in the future and whose help we </p><p>have had in the past.  Political considerations, as well </p><p>as economic, are important to developing our position on </p><p>this issue.  Embassy urges we meet their modest request </p><p>on the LDC Graduation issue.  Please advise.  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>CAMP </p><p></p></div>
