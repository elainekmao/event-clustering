<p>UNCLAS FRANKFURT 000926 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, GM </p><p>SUBJECT:  B-W CDU CAUCUS CHIEF EXPECTS M-P TEUFEL TO STEP </p><p>DOWN IN THE SUMMER OF 2004 </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary: In a meeting with Consul General on January 29, </p><p>Baden-Wuerttemberg (B-W) caucus chief Guenther Oettinger, </p><p>the possible successor to B-W Minister President Erwin </p><p>Teufel (CDU), spoke about the upcoming elections in Hesse </p><p>and Lower Saxony and his own political future.  He also used </p><p>the occasion to express his party\'s firm support of the U.S. </p><p>Administration. Oettinger criticized the national government </p><p>for straining the U.S.-German relationship for purely </p><p>tactical reasons.  Concerning the upcoming state elections </p><p>in Hesse and Lower Saxony, Oettinger is confident that the </p><p>CDU will win both elections.  Via the Bundesrat, the CDU </p><p>will increase the pressure on the national government to go </p><p>ahead with fundamental reforms.  Concerning his own future, </p><p>Oettinger stated that he expects Minister President (M-P) </p><p>Teufel to step down in the middle of next year to give his </p><p>successor a chance to start on the 2006-election campaign. </p><p>Oettinger hinted that he would be ready to take over if the </p><p>party supports him.  In any case, he will not be available </p><p>as caucus chief in the next legislative period starting </p><p>2006.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  Oettinger expressed his deep regret over the tension </p><p>that Chancellor Schroeder has brought into the German- </p><p>American relationship. The B-W state government and in </p><p>particular the state CDU are disappointed that 55 years of </p><p>friendship with the U.S. are being jeopardized for tactical </p><p>reasons.  However, Oettinger believes that the "Iraq card" </p><p>will not work for the state elections in Hesse and Lower </p><p>Saxony.  According to him, the voters want to hear about </p><p>internal issues like unemployment, education or taxes. </p><p> </p><p>3. Oettinger was fairly confident that Hesse M-P Roland Koch </p><p>will be re-elected. Christian Wulff, the CDU candidate </p><p>running against Lower Saxony M-P Siegmar Gabriel (SPD) is in </p><p>a slightly different situation in that he would not have a </p><p>chance if the national SPD/Green coalition government wasn\'t </p><p>as unpopular as it is.  Since the federal government has no </p><p>new ideas and no clear plan for the nation, the electorate </p><p>in the two states will take the opportunity to cast a </p><p>protest vote.  He predicted that most of the frustration </p><p>would hit the SPD.  The Greens are in a better position </p><p>since they are not that close to the unions and thus in a </p><p>better position to call for reforms. </p><p> </p><p>4.  Concerning the future of the liberal Free Democratic </p><p>Party (FDP), Oettinger pointed out that the FDP is in a </p><p>pretty comfortable situation in the southwest.  B-W is the </p><p>political home of both the FDP and the Greens.  The Liberals </p><p>are deeply rooted in the southwest and their prospects in B- </p><p>W are good.  For the national party, he sees no quick </p><p>solution to the Moellemann-Westerwelle conflict.  The FDP\'s </p><p>"18 percent" strategy was not enough to convince voters, </p><p>since it could not make up for the lack of a party platform </p><p>with mass appeal.  Oettinger sees the FDP back in its </p><p>traditional role of a kingmaker after the Hesse and Lower </p><p>Saxony State elections.  In both states, the Liberals will </p><p>be needed to secure a majority in parliament for either </p><p>party - a role they have been playing for decades.  A CDU </p><p>election victory in Hesse and Lower Saxony will not bring </p><p>down the national government. However, it will bring the CDU </p><p>into a position to exert even greater influence on national </p><p>politics from the Bundesrat in which the opposition already </p><p>enjoys a majority).  The CDU will try to speed up the reform </p><p>process and will force the national government to make </p><p>compromises.  An election victory in both states would </p><p>increase the CDU majority in the Bundesrat in such a way </p><p>that it could almost be considered a "parallel government," </p><p>Oettinger said. </p><p> </p><p>5.  When asked about possible CDU/Greens cooperation on </p><p>state level, Oettinger noted that a CDU/Greens coalition </p><p>will come whenever it helps to avoid SPD/PDS or SPD/Greens </p><p>coalitions.  As an example, he cited the Saarland as </p><p>possible model for the first CDU/Green coalition on a state </p><p>level in 2004.  However, as long as the FDP is available as </p><p>a coalition partner, there is no need for the CDU to </p><p>consider cooperation with the Greens. </p><p> </p><p>6.  Concerning his own political future in the southwest, </p><p>Oettinger stated that M-P Teufel would not run in the 2006 </p><p>election campaign.  Next year, the CDU will have to decide </p><p>who is to succeed Teufel, Oettinger said.  He noted that it </p><p>would be an important advantage for the party if the CDU can </p><p>go into the 2006 election campaign with a new Minister </p><p>President who has already assumed responsibility.  Oettinger </p><p>also stated that in case the CDU does not decide in his </p><p>favor, he would no longer be available for the position of </p><p>caucus chief in the next legislative period. </p><p> </p><p>Bodde </p><p></p></div>
