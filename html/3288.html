<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 KATHMANDU 001348 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA/INS, SA/PD AND DRL </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT ALSO PASS USAID FOR ANE/SA AND ANE/RA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:    N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, EAID, PREL, NP, Government of Nepal (GON) </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL\'S ELECTION COMMISSION REQUESTS DONOR </p><p>ASSISTANCE </p><p> </p><p>REF:  KATHMANDU 1285 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  This is an action message.  Please see Para 13. </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Summary:  Despite growing concern that security </p><p>considerations and other factors may force the cancellation </p><p>of national elections planned for November 13 (reftel), the </p><p>Government of Nepal (GON) is, ostensibly at least, </p><p>proceeding with preparations.  On July 5 the Election </p><p>Commission presented donors with a lengthy wish list that </p><p>includes even the most basic equipment--a strong indication </p><p>that the GON is unprepared to meet most of the costs of </p><p>holding the polls.  The Embassy believes that the USG should </p><p>support GON efforts to hold free and fair elections by </p><p>committing to supply some of the requested items that we are </p><p>best positioned to provide--such as voter education and </p><p>Internet assistance.  Department is requested to advise how </p><p>the U.S. Mission may indicate its support in advance of a </p><p>July 16 donor meeting on this topic.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>INK AND INTERNET:  EC LISTS MULTIPLE NEEDS </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  Reftel detailed growing concern among a wide </p><p>range of observers that the November 13 national elections </p><p>may be cancelled for a number of reasons, including security </p><p>and a pending Supreme Court decision on their </p><p>constitutionality.  So far, no decision has been made on </p><p>proposals to hold the elections in two or more discrete </p><p>phases.  Nonetheless, the Government of Nepal (GON) is </p><p>plowing ahead with initial preparations--e.g., an appeal to </p><p>the donor community to supply most of the nuts and bolts </p><p>needed to hold the elections.  (Note:  The FY 03 budget </p><p>announced July 8 allocates approximately USD 7 million in </p><p>funding for the Election Commission, a 54.4 percent increase </p><p>over last year.)  In addition, the Election Commission (EC) </p><p>is reportedly consulting with the political parties on the </p><p>number and location of polling places, and a committee is </p><p>working to update the constituencies to reflect the latest </p><p>national census figures. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  On July 5 the three-member EC convened a meeting of </p><p>the donor community to present a lengthy wish list of basic </p><p>needs.  A synopsis of the list, with costs estimated by the </p><p>EC, follows below: </p><p> </p><p>A) Six new photocopiers to copy voters\' lists (est. cost for </p><p>four copiers: USD 100,000); </p><p> </p><p>B) 40 telefax machines for use in district election offices </p><p>(est. cost: USD 13,000); </p><p> </p><p>C)  6,500 ballot boxes (est. cost: USD 250,000); </p><p> </p><p>D)  Training for 7,000 polling officers (est. cost: USD </p><p>307,500); </p><p> </p><p>E) Training for 205 Returning Officers (est. cost: USD </p><p>32,000); </p><p> </p><p>F)  Voter education and awareness (est. cost: USD 128,000); </p><p> </p><p>G)  30 ml indelible ink for 7,000 polling centers (est. </p><p>cost: USD 28,000); </p><p> </p><p>H)  Printing press for ballot papers (est. cost: USD </p><p>32,000); </p><p> </p><p>I)  Uploading of electoral roll and vote count on Internet </p><p>(est. cost: USD 41,000); </p><p> </p><p>J)  International election observers (cost not estimated); </p><p> </p><p>K)  Mobile satellite communications system for 19 districts </p><p>with no telephone service (cost not estimated); </p><p> </p><p>L)  Media center (cost not estimated); and </p><p> </p><p>M)  Printing and distribution of Voter ID Cards in 13 </p><p>constituencies (cost not estimated). </p><p>5.  (SBU)  None of the donors at the July 5 meeting </p><p>committed to supplying any of the requested items.  Donors </p><p>are meeting among themselves July 16 to discuss which, if </p><p>any, of the requested items their governments may be able to </p><p>provide.  The UNDP, which coordinated international election </p><p>observers for the 1999 elections, was asked to once again </p><p>play this role.  UNDP agreed, but reminded the government </p><p>that it takes time to organize observers, implying that it </p><p>is critical to set the date(s) well in advance, particularly </p><p>if the election will be held in multiple phases.  (Note: </p><p>the GON said that it will fix the dates "at least two months </p><p>before the election."  End Note.)  The Danes, who have an </p><p>ongoing program of technical assistance to the Election </p><p>Commission, agreed to play a coordinating role among donors </p><p>for financial support as it had in the last elections. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>MILITARY PREPARATIONS </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  The military, which will be working with the </p><p>police to provide security for the elections, has cancelled </p><p>all training from October to December.  Troops will begin </p><p>deployment six weeks before the beginning of elections.  The </p><p>Royal Nepal Army is planning to hold a briefing on its </p><p>preparations to provide security for elections July 16. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>RECOMMENDATIONS FOR USG SUPPORT </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU)  Despite our own reservations about whether the </p><p>elections can be held as scheduled, the Embassy believes </p><p>that the USG, as a matter of policy, should be forthcoming </p><p>in its support for GON efforts to hold free and fair </p><p>national elections.  The post Democracy Committee met on </p><p>July 9 to review the EC\'s request, and noted four areas </p><p>where we believe the U.S. Mission can be most helpful. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU)  Voter Education and Awareness Raising.  USAID has </p><p>funded, through the National Democratic Institute (NDI), a </p><p>successful voter-education project that concludes in August. </p><p>This program has produced voter education pamphlets; a 10- </p><p>episode radio drama in ten languages which aired nationally; </p><p>and election manuals for district-level officials and </p><p>community/political leaders which have been used in training </p><p>at district and constituency levels in selected districts. </p><p>In our view, USAID\'s experience in this area, and the fact </p><p>that USAID has been the only donor supporting voter </p><p>education, makes voter education the most logical and cost- </p><p>effective assistance we can offer.  We also believe that the </p><p>needs for awareness raising and education are much greater </p><p>than estimated by the EC. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU)  Media Center at Election Commission:  Since most </p><p>media centers--at least those for the international press </p><p>pool--are self-funded, we do not recommend financial support </p><p>for the establishment of such a center.  On the other hand, </p><p>we do anticipate that the GON will need substantial </p><p>technical assistance to plan such a center. The GON could </p><p>capitalize on the expertise acquired in setting up the </p><p>center, replicating it during future events of international </p><p>interest.  We thus recommend that the Department fund a </p><p>short-term consultant to work with the GON on devising a </p><p>plan for the establishment, operation and funding of the </p><p>center. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU)  Internet Posting of Electoral Role and Vote </p><p>Count:  We recommend funding the uploading of the electoral </p><p>roll and the voters lists on the Internet.  Some of the </p><p>funding for this initiative could come from reprogrammed FY </p><p>02 ESF funds or from PD funds. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (SBU)  Electoral Observers:  The Election Commission </p><p>requested all donors to provide observers for the election. </p><p>Estimating the cost of providing such observers will be </p><p>difficult until the Election Commission decides whether to </p><p>hold the election in phases.  We should, however, be </p><p>prepared to fund at least a modest contingent of observers </p><p>for a minimum of 10 days each, as well as any required </p><p>training.  The Asia Foundation has submitted an unsolicited </p><p>proposal (forwarded by e-mail to SA/INS) for support for </p><p>election observers. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (SBU)  Funding:  Mission understands that USAID\'s ANE </p><p>Bureau may be prepared to provide USD 250,000 for election- </p><p>related support.  This is welcomed.  For financial </p><p>contributions beyond that amount, the Mission could </p><p>reprogram some of the already requested USD 750,000 in </p><p>Economic Support Funds (ESF) for FY 02 for other programs. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>ACTION REQUEST </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  (SBU) Action Request:  Embassy requests Department </p><p>guidance in advance of the July 16 donors meeting on which </p><p>of the items requested by the EC we may be prepared to </p><p>support.  If the Department agrees that some of the items </p><p>requested could be supported from reprogrammed FY 02 ESF </p><p>funds, Department is requested to advise when such funds may </p><p>become available. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
