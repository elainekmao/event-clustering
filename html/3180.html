<p>UNCLAS ROME 003031 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: MARR, MCAP, MOPS, PREL, PGOV, IT, NATO </p><p>SUBJECT: WOMAN IN DEFENSE:  ITALY\'S EXPERIENCE AFTER TWO </p><p>YEARS </p><p> </p><p>1.  SUMMARY.  AS THE GOI ATTEMPTS TO RESTRUCTURE AND </p><p>"PROFESSIONALIZE" THE MILITARY SERVICE, BRINGING FEMALES IN </p><p>IS VIEWED AS ONE WAY TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF THE ARMED </p><p>FORCES.  ITALIAN WOMEN, WHETHER FOR ECONOMIC OR SOCIAL </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  03031  221235Z </p><p>REASONS, ARE HIGHLY MOTIVATED AND HAVE BEEN INTEGRATED </p><p>QUICKLY INTO THE MILITARY RANKS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  THE RECENTLY FOUNDED CENTER FOR STUDY OF DEFENSE AND </p><p>SECURITY ("CENTRO STUDI DIFESA E SICUREZZA) DEDICATED ITS </p><p>FIRST CONFERENCE ON 19 JUNE TO THE TOPIC OF "WOMEN IN THE </p><p>ARMED FORCES AND POLICE."  PRESIDED BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE </p><p>DEFENSE COMMITTEE IN THE LOWER HOUSE OF PARLIAMENT, LUIGI </p><p>RAMPONI, THE CONFERENCE DREW REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE </p><p>MILITARY (INCLUDING A LARGE CONTINGENT OF UNIFORMED FEMALE </p><p>OFFICERS), POLICE, GOVERNMENT AND PRESS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  ITALY IS ONE OF THE LAST NATO MEMBERS TO ACCEPT FEMALES </p><p>IN THE ARMED FORCES.  VOLUNTARY FEMALE MILITARY SERVICE WAS </p><p>INTRODUCED IN AN OCTOBER 20, 1999 LAW.  WITH THE OFFICIAL </p><p>UNEMPLOYMENT RATE AT 9.2 PERCENT AND ITALIAN WOMAN HAVING THE </p><p>HIGHEST NUMBER OF WORKING HOURS AT HOME IN EUROPE, MANY SEE </p><p>MILITARY SERVICE AS A WAY TO EARN A LIVING AND TO ESCAPE </p><p>TRADITIONAL FEMALE ROLES.  WHILE MANY NEW ENTRANTS ARE STILL </p><p>IN MILITARY ACADEMIES (ONE WOMAN IN THE AUDIENCE WAS </p><p>APPLAUDED FOR BEING AT THE TOP OF HER CLASS), THE EXPERIENCE </p><p>SO FAR SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN POSITIVE, WITH FEW PROBLEMS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  ACCORDING TO MINISTER FOR EQUAL OPPORTUNITY STEFANIA </p><p>PRESTIGIACOMO, HOWEVER, THE 1999 LAW AND SUBSEQUENT </p><p>REGULATIONS DESIGNED TO AVOID DISCRIMINATION ARE NOT ENOUGH </p><p>-- ITALY\'S TRADITIONAL CULTURAL VIEW OF WOMEN AS HOMEMAKERS </p><p>ALSO NEEDS TO CHANGE.  PRESTIGIACOMO SAID THAT ITALIAN </p><p>SOCIETY AND THE ARMED FORCES HAVE ACCEPTED WOMEN WELL, BUT </p><p>THAT THE INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK IS LAGGING.  SHE SUGGESTED </p><p>THAT, DRAWING ON THE EXPERIENCE OF INTERNATIONAL </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  03031  221235Z </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS, THE GOI CAN MAKE NUMEROUS SMALL CHANGES IN THE </p><p>AREAS OF INSURANCE, SCHOOLING, AND HOUSING THAT WILL LEVEL </p><p>THE PLAYING FIELD FOR WOMEN WHOSE MILITARY CAREERS WOULD </p><p>OTHERWISE ENTAIL GREAT SACRIFICES FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR </p><p>FAMILIES.  CITING THE EXAMPLE OF ONE WOMAN WHO LOST HER PLACE </p><p>ON THE ADMISSIONS LIST BECAUSE SHE BECAME PREGNANT, </p><p>PRESTIGIACOMO STRESSED THAT THE MILITARY MUST BECOME MORE </p><p>"HUMAN." </p><p> </p><p>5.  ALTHOUGH MOST OF THE CONFERENCE DEALT WITH THE ISSUES </p><p>AFFECTING WOMEN IN THE MILITARY, SEVERAL SPEAKERS ALSO </p><p>ADDRESSED THE PROBLEM OF REVERSE DISCRIMINATION.  THERE IS </p><p>SOME CONCERN AMONG THE MILITARY RANKS THAT WOMEN ARE BEING </p><p>AFFORDED SPECIAL TREATMENT TO THE DETRIMENT OF THEIR MALE </p><p>COUNTERPARTS.  OVERALL, HOWEVER, THE CONSENSUS WAS THAT, TWO </p><p>YEARS LATER, THE ITALIAN EXPERIENCE WITH WOMEN IN THE </p><p>MILITARY HAS BEEN POSITIVE. </p><p> </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME03031 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
