<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 LAGOS 000505 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CAIRO FOR POL -- MAXSTADT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/06/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINR, ASEC, KDEM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: HARRY\'S MURDER FLAMES PORT HARCOURT </p><p>TENSIONS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ABUJA 00448 </p><p>     B. ABUJA 00449 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: CONSUL GENERAL ROBYN HINSON-JONES.  REASON:  1.5 (B & D) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) SUMMARY.  Marshall Harry\'s death on March 5 is the </p><p>latest in a series of murders regarded by southern Nigerians </p><p>as political assassinations.  His death has raised tensions </p><p>in the Rivers State capital of Port Harcourt, where the </p><p>leading opposition presidential candidate plns to hold a </p><p>rally tomorrow, March 8.  Harry\'s death is being interpreted </p><p>in the South as a warning to politicians that some of them </p><p>will try to attain and hold on to power at all costs.  (See </p><p>also septel "WHO WAS MARSHALL HARRY?")  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>ANPP RALLY MOVES FORWARD </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) ANPP\'s rally for presidential candidate Muhammadu </p><p>Buhari, organized by Marshall Harry just prior to his death, </p><p>is still scheduled to take place at the Port Harcourt </p><p>Liberation Stadium tomorrow, March 8.  Deputy Police </p><p>Commissioner for Rivers State B.A. Hassan told poloff March 7 </p><p>that the police are "prepared for a potential backlash," but </p><p>he does not anticipate there will be a disturbance.  He </p><p>expressed confidence in the ability of his "men on the ground </p><p>to contain any problems" and said they will "meet with the </p><p>political heads to reach an understanding" that the event </p><p>should go peacefully.  He said he expects the leaders will in </p><p>turn talk to their youth supporters to ensure that no </p><p>violence will break out among them. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Despite hopes, the rally may become dangerous and </p><p>peace unpredictable.  A rumor circulated earlier this week </p><p>that youths would burn down the stadium in retaliation for </p><p>the alleged higher fee charged for ANPP\'s use of the facility </p><p>than that recently charged for a similar PDP function. </p><p>Rumors that the ANPP may display Harry\'s corpse at the rally </p><p>could create a "volatile emotional situation" and provoke </p><p>supporters to "go on the rampage," as a Halliburton security </p><p>report recently noted.  "The situation can also be hijacked </p><p>by miscreants," they observe. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) ANPP National Chairman Don Etiebet was quoted on </p><p>March 5 as saying, "I want to call on all Nigerians to hold </p><p>the PDP government and Chief Olusegun Obasanjo responsible </p><p>for the gunning down of our members all over the country.  If </p><p>these intimidations and killings continue we have no option </p><p>than to call on all Nigerians to defend themselves" (Reuters, </p><p>"Nigeria opposition chief assassinated." 3/5/03). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>PORT HARCOURT ON EDGE </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Human rights groups have reported that there is "very </p><p>strong suspicion in Port Harcourt that the PDP has a hand in </p><p>the killing."  Chris Newsom of Friends of the Ogoni People </p><p>recently said: "Marshall Harry\'s death is not a bolt from the </p><p>blue.  He had alerted the public of threats against his life </p><p>for some time.  The message people are taking from this is, </p><p>\'This is just the beginning.\'  People are interpreting the </p><p>act to be one of pure intimidation, as if to say, \'If we can </p><p>take Harry down, nobody is safe.\'"  Multiple credible sources </p><p>say armed thugs referred to as "Odili Boys" continue to </p><p>harass political opponents of Governor Odili.  Over the past </p><p>several months, an increasing number of Southerners have been </p><p>echoing Harry\'s accusation (septel) that the Rivers State </p><p>Government has been directly arming thugs to maintain the </p><p>incumbent\'s support. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Human rights activists and Rivers State government </p><p>officials are concerned about their personal safety. </p><p>"Confidence in Port Harcourt regarding the safety of </p><p>political players of all shades is very, very, low," said </p><p>Newsom.  Rivers State Attorney General Aleruchi Cookey-Gam </p><p>told poloff on March 7 that officials "have been advised to </p><p>take proper caution, though the climate has been peaceful </p><p>except for a few pockets.  Overall, it has been better than </p><p>could be expected.  Police are on the alert and working hard </p><p>to maintain peace."  Azibaola Robert, president of the Niger </p><p>Delta Human and Environmental Rescue Organization (ND-HERO) </p><p>met with other human rights groups in Port Harcourt today </p><p>(March 7) and will issue a statement calling for responsible </p><p>parties to "eschew bitterness and violence."  Ledum Mitee, </p><p>president of the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni </p><p>People (MOSOP), will meet today (March 7) with Governor </p><p>Odili.  MOSOP and other groups also plan to air a radio </p><p>statement appealing for public calm. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>INITIAL PROTESTS CALMED DOWN </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Official and NGO sources confirmed that the </p><p>atmosphere is "pretty calm" now.  On the night of March 5 or </p><p>early morning of March 6, someone dynamited the private </p><p>medical clinic of the Secretary to Rivers State Government </p><p>Abiye Sekibo, but eye-witnesses say the property suffered </p><p>minor damage.  Press reports said one patient was injured and </p><p>moved to a state hospital.  Most targets have been "property, </p><p>not people," said Newsom.  "A few people have been roughed </p><p>up.  But no one has been killed, to my knowledge," he said. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) On March 5, an estimated five hundred protestors </p><p>marched from Harry\'s Port Harcourt office through the streets </p><p>toward the airport, carrying signs reading "Who killed </p><p>Marshall Harry?" and "Why him, Marshall Harry?"  As a </p><p>precaution, Halliburton raised its security alert level to </p><p>"high" within Port Harcourt, and reported that some "vehicles </p><p>were burnt and people were brutalized.  A Coca Cola truck was </p><p>seized and the bottles used as weapons.  Despite the presence </p><p>of policemen on the airport road, some groups of rampaging </p><p>youths are targeting and vandalizing any government vehicle </p><p>in sight."  Multiple sources confirm that "a couple" of </p><p>vehicles were burned, including one federal government </p><p>vehicle.  Government vehicles are now absent from Port </p><p>Harcourt streets. Rivers State House of Assembly Speaker </p><p>Rotimi Amaechi described Port Harcourt on March 5 to poloff </p><p>as "calm, but there are lots of rumors, tensions, and threats </p><p>circulating."  Lowering his voice, he added, "I am a member </p><p>of PDP, but I don\'t like what is happening." Poloff was </p><p>unable to get him to elaborate on this remark. </p><p>HINSON-JONES </p><p></p></div>
