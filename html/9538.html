<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 ANKARA 004548 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EB/IFD/OIA </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA </p><p>DEPT PLEASE PASS USTR </p><p>FAS FOR ITP/THORBURN </p><p>USDOC FOR ITA/MAC/DDEFALCO </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EINV, KTDB, EFIN, TU </p><p>SUBJECT:  2003 INVESTMENT CLIMATE STATEMENT FOR TURKEY - </p><p>PART II </p><p> </p><p>Ref: STATE 128494 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The following is the second of four cables transmitting the </p><p>2003 Investment Climate Statement for Turkey: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS/INCENTIVES </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turkey is a party to the WTO Agreement on Trade Related </p><p>Investment Measures (TRIMS). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turkey provides investment incentives to both domestic and </p><p>foreign investors, though these were scaled back in 2003. </p><p>These include a corporate tax exemption of 40 percent of </p><p>specified investment expenses deductible from future taxable </p><p>profits for investments greater than 5 billion TL </p><p>(approximately USD 3,600).  Certain other incentives may </p><p>require an incentive certificate from the Turkish Treasury </p><p>Undersecretariat.  Investment incentives are defined in a </p><p>May 2003 Finance Ministry decree.  For more information on </p><p>the Turkish incentive system, please visit: </p><p>www.investinturkey.gov.tr/incentives.htm). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>There are no performance requirements imposed as a condition </p><p>for establishing, maintaining, or expanding an investment. </p><p>There are no requirements that investors purchase from local </p><p>sources or export a certain percentage of output.  However, </p><p>domestic or foreign investors who commit to realizing USD </p><p>10,000 of exports upon completion of the investment may be </p><p>exempt from certain fees and taxes, such as those related to </p><p>land registration or company establishment.  Investors\' </p><p>access to foreign exchange has no relation to exports. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>There are no requirements that nationals own shares in </p><p>foreign investments, that the shares of foreign equity be </p><p>reduced over time, or that the investor transfer technology </p><p>on certain terms.  There are no government imposed </p><p>conditions on permission to invest, including location in </p><p>specific geographical areas, specific percentage of local </p><p>content - for goods or services - or local equity, import </p><p>substitution, export requirements or targets, employment of </p><p>host country nationals, technology transfer, or local </p><p>financing. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The GOT does not request that investors disclose proprietary </p><p>information, other than publicly available information, as </p><p>part of the regulatory approval process.  Enterprises with </p><p>foreign capital must send their activity report, submitted </p><p>to the general assembly of shareholders, auditor\'s report, </p><p>and balance sheets to the Treasury\'s Foreign Investment </p><p>Directorate every year by May. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>With the exceptions noted under Section 1 "Openness to </p><p>Foreign Investment" and Section 8 "Transparency of the </p><p>Regulatory System", Turkey grants all rights, incentives, </p><p>exemptions and privileges available to national capital and </p><p>business to foreign capital and business, on a MFN basis. </p><p>American and other foreign firms can participate in </p><p>government-financed and/or subsidized research and </p><p>development programs on a national treatment basis. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Visa, residence, or work permit requirements have not </p><p>generally inhibited foreign investors.  Expatriates may be </p><p>assigned as managers or technical staff.  We are aware of </p><p>one case in the tourism sector in which denial of a </p><p>residence permit has hindered operations for a foreign </p><p>investor.  A 2003 law (no. 4817) on work authorizations for </p><p>foreign nationals should give the Ministry of Labor and </p><p>Social Security more authority over work permits. </p><p>Implementing regulations are to be issued later this year. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Outside of the agricultural sector, Turkey generally has a </p><p>liberal foreign trade regime.  There are no discriminatory </p><p>or preferential export or import policies directly affecting </p><p>foreign investors.  Turkey harmonized its export incentive </p><p>regime with the European Union in 1995, prior to the start </p><p>of the Customs Union.  Turkey currently offers a number of </p><p>export incentives, including credits through the Turkish </p><p>Eximbank, energy incentives, and research and development </p><p>incentives.  Cash incentives for exporters have been </p><p>eliminated.  Foreign investors can participate in these </p><p>export incentive programs on a national treatment basis. </p><p>More information on Turkey\'s trade regime can be found at </p><p>www.foreigntrade.gov.tr. </p><p>Military procurement generally requires an offset provision </p><p>in tender specifications when the estimated value of the </p><p>imported goods and/or services exceeds five million dollars. </p><p>Turkish procedures provide little incentive for U.S. </p><p>companies to satisfy offset requirements (the obligation to </p><p>invest or buy Turkish exports as a condition of winning </p><p>defense contracts) by investing in non-defense industries. </p><p>6.  RIGHT TO PRIVATE OWNERSHIP AND ESTABLISHMENT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Foreign and domestic private entities have the right to </p><p>freely establish and own business enterprises and engage in </p><p>all forms of remunerative activity.  As noted above, </p><p>restrictions exist in the establishment of firms in certain </p><p>sectors where the share of foreign ownership is limited to </p><p>20 percent in broadcasting and up to 49 percent in aviation, </p><p>maritime transportation, and value-added telecommunication </p><p>services.  Certain activities are reserved for GOT owned </p><p>enterprises.  For example, by law, Turk Telekom has a </p><p>monopoly until December 31, 2003 on providing basic </p><p>telephone services.  Beyond these areas, private entities </p><p>may freely establish, acquire, and dispose of interests in </p><p>business enterprises, and foreign participation is permitted </p><p>up to 100 percent. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Competitive equality is the standard applied to private </p><p>enterprises in competition with public enterprises with </p><p>respect to access to markets, credit, and other business </p><p>operations.  Turkey is adopting the EU\'s competition policy; </p><p>a Competition Board was established in 1997 to implement the </p><p>1994 competition (anti-monopoly) law. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  PROTECTION OF PROPERTY RIGHTS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Secured interests in property, both chattel and real are </p><p>recognized and enforced.  There is a recognized and reliable </p><p>system of recording such security interests.  For example, </p><p>there is a land registry office where real estate is </p><p>registered.  Turkey\'s legal system protects and facilitates </p><p>acquisition and disposal of property rights, including land, </p><p>buildings, and mortgages, although some parties have </p><p>complained that the courts are slow in rendering decisions </p><p>and that they are susceptible to external influence (see </p><p>"Dispute Settlement"). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turkey\'s intellectual property rights regime has improved, </p><p>but still presents problems.  In 1995, the Turkish </p><p>Parliament approved new patent, trademark and copyright laws </p><p>in connection with preparations for Turkey\'s customs union </p><p>with the EU. In 2001, the Parliament enacted amendments to </p><p>the copyright law, which provide retroactive protection, </p><p>expand the list of protected items and include deterrent </p><p>penalties against piracy.  These amendments brought Turkey </p><p>into compliance with the WTO Agreement on Trade Related </p><p>Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) in most </p><p>areas.  In recognition of Turkey\'s progress in the IPR area, </p><p>USTR removed Turkey from its Special 301 Priority Watch List </p><p>and placed the country on its Watch List in 2002, where it </p><p>remains in 2003. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Intellectual property holders have praised Turkey\'s 2001 </p><p>legislation as a significant improvement in the legal </p><p>regime.   In the software area, piracy rates have come down </p><p>in recent years following an anti-piracy campaign and a </p><p>directive to legalize software used in government bodies. </p><p>However, piracy rates for recorded music remain persistently </p><p>high.  Trademark holders contend that there is widespread </p><p>and often sophisticated counterfeiting of their marks in </p><p>Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turkey\'s 1995 patent law replaced a law originally passed in </p><p>1879.  New trademark, industrial design, and geographic </p><p>indicator laws were passed at the same time, completely </p><p>revamping Turkey\'s foundation for industrial property </p><p>protection.  Turkey also acceded to a number of </p><p>international conventions in 1995, including the Stockholm </p><p>Act of the Paris Convention, the Patent Cooperation Treaty, </p><p>and the Strasbourg Agreement.  The Turkish Patent Institute </p><p>(TPI) was established in 1994 as an independent legal entity </p><p>(Law No. 4004, June 16, 1994) under the Ministry of Industry </p><p>and Trade.  TPI\'s mission is to support technological </p><p>development in Turkey, establish and protect intellectual </p><p>property rights and provide public information on </p><p>intellectual property rights.  Currently, TPI is </p><p>understaffed to affect countrywide protection. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In accordance with the 1995 patent law and Turkey\'s </p><p>agreement with the EU, patent protection for pharmaceuticals </p><p>began on January 1, 1999.  Turkey has been accepting patent </p><p>applications since 1996 in compliance with the TRIPS </p><p>agreement "mailbox" provisions.  The patent law does not, </p><p>however, contain interim protection for pharmaceuticals in </p><p>the R&D "pipeline." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The key IPR concern for research-based pharmaceutical </p><p>companies is Turkey\'s lack of data exclusivity protection, </p><p>which is required by the TRIPS agreement.  The lack of data </p><p>exclusivity, combined with the lack of interim patent </p><p>protection, poses substantial problems for research-based </p><p>pharmaceutical companies. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  TRANSPARENCY OF THE REGULATORY SYSTEM </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The GOT has adopted policies and laws, which in principle </p><p>should foster competition and transparency. However, foreign </p><p>companies in several sectors claim that regulations are </p><p>sometimes applied in a nontransparent manner.  In 2002, the </p><p>GOT published a report on transparency and good governance </p><p>in Turkey\'s public sector and established an interagency </p><p>steering committee to implement it.  The plan calls for: </p><p>greater public access to information from the government and </p><p>public sector entities; financial disclosure by elected </p><p>public officials; and decentralization of most public </p><p>services. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The government in principle follows competitive bidding </p><p>procedures.  In 2003, Law 4734 on Public Procurement entered </p><p>into force.  The law established a board to oversee public </p><p>tenders, and lowered the minimum bidding threshold at which </p><p>foreign companies can participate in state tenders. </p><p>However, the law restricts preferences for domestic bidders </p><p>to Turkish citizens and legal entities established by them. </p><p>Domestic bidders who form joint ventures with foreign </p><p>bidders are not eligible for the preference.  The public </p><p>procurement law may be further amended in the future. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In general, labor, health and safety laws and policies do </p><p>not distort or impede investment, although legal </p><p>restrictions on discharging employees may provide a </p><p>disincentive to labor-intensive activity in the formal </p><p>economy.  Certain tax policies distort investment decisions. </p><p>High taxation of cola drinks discourage investment in this </p><p>sector.  Generous tax preferences for free zones provide a </p><p>stimulus to investment in these zones, perhaps at the </p><p>expense of investment elsewhere in Turkey.  These </p><p>preferences may be trimmed under legislation currently under </p><p>consideration. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Particularly beyond the establishment phase, bureaucratic </p><p>"red tape" has been  a significant barrier to companies, </p><p>both foreign and domestic.  Parliament passed Law 4884 in </p><p>June 2003 which should simplify company establishment </p><p>procedures.  The law repeals the permit requirement from the </p><p>Industry and Commerce Ministry for certain firms, institutes </p><p>a single company registration form and enables individuals </p><p>to register their companies through local commercial </p><p>registry offices of the Turkish Union of Chambers and </p><p>Commodity Exchanges.  The goal is to enable registration to </p><p>be completed in as little as one day and to encourage </p><p>electronic sharing of documents.  Turkish government </p><p>agencies are expected to issue implementing regulations </p><p>needed to bring the law into force.  The government is also </p><p>considering other measures  to streamline procedures for </p><p>establishing and operating a business in Turkey, based on </p><p>recommendations made in a World Bank-funded study on </p><p>administrative barriers to investment. </p><p>Pearson </p><p></p></div>
