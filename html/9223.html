<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 HARARE 001371 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PDPA FOR DALTON, MITCHELL AND SIMS </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA COVERAGE PRESIDENT BUSH\'S VISIT TO AFRICA; </p><p>HARARE </p><p> </p><p>  1.   An avalanche of news articles and opinion pieces </p><p>      focusing on the decisive African Nations Cup </p><p>      qualifying soccer match between Zimbabwe and </p><p>      Eritrea, especially in the government-controlled </p><p>      print and electronic media, failed to eclipse </p><p>      critical articles against President George W. Bush\'s </p><p>      visit to Africa.  In a move described by political </p><p>      analysts as "a deliberate ploy" to deflect and drown </p><p>      out public attention from President Bush\'s imminent </p><p>      visit to Africa, the government-controlled media </p><p>      deliberately down-played politics from the usual </p><p>      pole position to promote the "crucial game."  Even </p><p>      the ZANU PF\'s important politburo meeting last </p><p>      Wednesday, including the subsequent 54th Session of </p><p>      the party\'s Central Committee meeting addressed by </p><p>      Robert Mugabe the following day, played second </p><p>      fiddle to news on the soccer match.  It was </p><p>      uncharacteristic of the state-run ZTV to tuck </p><p>      Mugabe\'s news clip - in which he urged the party\'s </p><p>      Central Committee members not to be cowed by Bush\'s </p><p>      visit - deep into Thursday\'s (July 3) "Newshour" </p><p>      bulletin at 2000 hours.  Excerpts of the of the nit- </p><p>      picking news articles, op-ed and opinion pieces </p><p>      against President Bush\'s visit that appeared mostly </p><p>      in the government-controlled and pro-government </p><p>      mainstream newspapers between July 4 and 7 follow: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   Under headline "Bush\'s visit threatens peace" the </p><p>      government-controlled daily "The Herald" (07/07) </p><p>      reproduced the following article by Patrica Gwen </p><p>      Afwoni, Africa Strategy Personal Assistant, African </p><p>      Region, on page 7: </p><p> </p><p>      "Africa Strategy notes with sadness and shame the </p><p>      degree of hypocrisy in which the current Right wing </p><p>      Republican Administration of George Bush has </p><p>      conducted its foreign policy on Africa.  The forth </p><p>      coming African tour of Bush. . .is designed to </p><p>      threaten the peace and widen the gaps between </p><p>      moderate states and war mongers in Africa. . .The </p><p>      spirit of Abraham Lincoln will roll in the grave </p><p>      when they hear that President Bush has visited a </p><p>      pseudo democracy in Uganda and spent over six hours </p><p>      dining and dancing with the military dictatorship </p><p>      that has refused people to associate and assemble </p><p>      freely. . .We note with great concern the way </p><p>      millions and millions of U. S. dollars are being </p><p>      channeled through Uganda to train and pay mercenary </p><p>      armies to overthrow the government of President </p><p>      Mugabe.  We are also worried about the Millions of </p><p>      USD that has been pumped into the hands of </p><p>      opposition in Zimbabwe for ECOMIC SABOTAGE (sic). . </p><p>      .Africa Strategy wishes to use this opportunity to </p><p>      warn all those who are bent on paying the government </p><p>      of Uganda to commit violence in the region like. . </p><p>      .the black surrogate Colin Powell that all the </p><p>      peaceful people of the region are documenting all </p><p>      your encounters.  We have now obtained clear </p><p>      evidence from sources about all your financial </p><p>      transactions which point at USA and Britain as the </p><p>      main countries fuelling violence in Zimbabwe. . .We </p><p>      are aware of the impending fabrication and malice </p><p>      that Colin Powell and Bush want to link the people </p><p>      of Zimbabwe and the Great Lakes Region so as to </p><p>      justify regime change. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>  3.   The July 6 edition of the independent weekly "The </p><p>      Daily News on Sunday" printed an article by Agence France- </p><p>      Presse  (AFP) on page one that reported on President Bush\'s </p><p>      interview centering on his imminent visit to Africa with </p><p>      the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) </p><p>      television.  The "Sunday Special" story ran under the </p><p>      headline "Bush calls for fresh Zimbabwe elections." </p><p>      Another independent weekly "the Standard" (07/06) also </p><p>      carried an article focusing on President Bush\'s visit to </p><p>      Africa on page one under headline "MDC to meet Bush over </p><p>      Mugabe." </p><p> </p><p>  4.   Under headline "Bush\'s Africa safari" the </p><p>      pro-government weekly "The Sunday Mirror" (07/06) </p><p>      carried the following opinion piece under the ghost </p><p>      column "The Scrutator" on page 10: </p><p> </p><p>      ". . .Despite assertions to the contrary, many of </p><p>      those (countries) left out of yet another sweeping </p><p>      but selective tour by the leader of the world\'s sole </p><p>      super power are quietly lamenting and, in some cases </p><p>      fearing, the possible implications of such </p><p>      exclusions and oversight. . . So serious is the U. </p><p>      S. A. about our continent that it has consistently </p><p>      demonstrated a disdain for both the Organization of </p><p>      African Unity which neither (Jimmy) Carter nor </p><p>      (Bill) Clinton visited on the occasion of their </p><p>      respective safaris, and the African Union which, if </p><p>      the U. S. administration had a more defined and </p><p>      sensitive policy in this regard, Bush could have </p><p>      accommodated in his schedule, especially since the </p><p>      AU Summit is meeting in Maputo next Friday. . </p><p>      .Indeed, the U. S. Africa policy is so largely </p><p>      immersed in strategic and economic considerations </p><p>      that the issue of democracy has always been quite </p><p>      secondary.  Even the outpourings on Zimbabwe are </p><p>      only part of that `democracy\' smokescreen.  Not </p><p>      surprisingly, therefore, Zimbabwe will not loom </p><p>      large nor should the MDC expect anything more than a </p><p>      reaffirmation of the `African initiative,\' </p><p>      spearheaded by South Africa, another long-standing </p><p>      `sub-center\' in the superpower\'s imperialist sphere </p><p>      of influence." </p><p> </p><p>  5.   The same newspaper also ran an interesting article by </p><p>      Tendai Chari" under his weekly column "Media Analysis" on </p><p>      page 11 - under headline "How about a regime change in the </p><p>      media?"  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>      "When U. S. A. President George Bush visits Southern </p><p>      Africa. . .he should bring with him, among other </p><p>      rescue packages, a rescue package for the Zimbabwean </p><p>      media?  He must also facilitate a regime change in </p><p>      our media.  The men and women of the pen have become </p><p>      the property and monopoly of political parties. . </p><p>      .Having earned himself the much-fancied title of </p><p>      `liberator\' in Iraq I expect President Bush to </p><p>      liberate our media from the bondage pf cronyism.  He </p><p>      must extricate these embeds from the clutches of </p><p>      politicians holding on to them with crab-like </p><p>      tenacity.  We need a free media. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>  6.   Under headline "Why Bush is coming to Africa: U. S. </p><p>      leader in bid to spread his imperialist wings" the July 6 </p><p>      edition of the government-controlled weekly "The Sunday </p><p>      Mail" carried the following opinion piece by Munyaradzi </p><p>      Huni, Political Editor, on page 9: </p><p> </p><p>      "So the African Union (AU) summit will be held in </p><p>      Maputo, Mozambique, this week, while the Texan </p><p>      gunslinger, Mr. George W. Bush, will at the same </p><p>      time be roaming around Africa for the time since he </p><p>      `stole\' the American election from Mr. Al Gore. . .? </p><p>      But then don\'t be fooled that it\'s by mere </p><p>      coincidence that the cunning fox decided to visit </p><p>      this beloved continent at the time when the AU will </p><p>      be taking place.  No! . . .And by the way, don\'t be </p><p>      fooled into thinking that Mr. Bush just woke up one </p><p>      day and decided to visit South Africa, Botswana, </p><p>      Uganda, Nigeria and Senegal. . .Mr. Bush is already </p><p>      dangling the carrot in billions of American dollars </p><p>      to buy out the African leaders so that they can </p><p>      allow him to spread his stinking imperialistic </p><p>      wings. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>  7.   Under headline "African leaders must rally behind </p><p>      Zimbabwe" the same newspaper carried the following </p><p>      opinion piece by South African-based independent </p><p>      political and socio-economic analyst and media </p><p>      columnist Udo W. Froese on page 10: </p><p> </p><p>      "It is clear that the mighty West. . .particularly </p><p>      Washington. . .will use Africa\'s own program, NEPAD, </p><p>      to discipline this continent and do the dirty work </p><p>      for and on behalf of the hopeful sponsors, the G-8 </p><p>      members.  African countries and their leadership </p><p>      will have to toe the line of the new world economic </p><p>      order and globalization, or face the music. </p><p>      However, both Western programs are to Africa\'s </p><p>      peril. . .Any attempt to destabilize Zimbabwe </p><p>      further would gave serious regional security </p><p>      implications.  It would enhance wide racism and </p><p>      instability.  As is it is, Zimbabwe is at war.  It </p><p>      would be a political and economic disaster for the </p><p>      Southern African development Community (SADC) to </p><p>      launch a military operation from neighboring </p><p>      Botswana and Uganda in order to force a `fast regime </p><p>      change\' in Zimbabwe.  As much as U. S. President </p><p>      George Bush wants to reward Britain\'s Tony Blair for </p><p>      his zealous support in Afghanistan and Iraq and the </p><p>      rest of the world by returning Zimbabwe to the </p><p>      British crown, such brutal action would create </p><p>      chaos, and terrorism would take advantage.  If </p><p>      President Mugabe\'s government would be destroyed, </p><p>      thousands of highly trained ZANU PF guerillas would </p><p>      retreat to the bush in order to again pick up the </p><p>      war for their country. . .This would cause havoc in </p><p>      the region. . .When America\'s President George W. </p><p>      Bush visits Africa this week, Africans have no </p><p>      alternative but to demonstrate that they are </p><p>      unanimous in their decision to counter any </p><p>      destabilization efforts in their regions.  Africa </p><p>      would do well rallying behind Zimbabwe. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>  8.   Under headline "Bush\'s Africa tour bound to fail - </p><p>       analysts" the Bulawayo-based government-controlled </p><p>       weekly "Sunday News" (07/06) carried the following </p><p>       article by Herbert Zharare, Chief Reporter, on page </p><p>       3: </p><p> </p><p>       "American President George W. Bush\'s visit to Africa </p><p>       next week, during which he will arm-twist Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>       neighbors to support a hostile Western campaign </p><p>       against the country, will fail dismally and also </p><p>       prove that the MDC leaders who are jostling to meet </p><p>       with him are puppets of imperialism, analysts have </p><p>       said. . .Political observers argued this week that </p><p>       there is no doubt that Mr. Bush will dangle several </p><p>       incentives to African countries, in a desperate bid </p><p>       to force them to support his agenda of toppling the </p><p>       elected government of Zimbabwe. . .Dr. (Tafataona) </p><p>       Mahoso said African countries that allowed </p><p>       themselves to be used by Mr. Bush to topple </p><p>       President Mugabe were going to be haunted by the </p><p>       aftermath of such an expedition.. . .Dr. William </p><p>       Nhara, the head of a Harare-based regional political </p><p>       think-tank, the Southern Africa Institute for </p><p>       Democracy, told `Sunday News\'. . .that the U. S. </p><p>       President can go ahead with is visit to selected </p><p>       African countries, but will achieve nothing. . </p><p>       .Bulawayo-based political and social commentator Dr. </p><p>       Lawton Hikwa concurred with Dr. Mahoso and Mr. Nhara </p><p>       that Mr. Bush\'s visit. . .was part of the Western </p><p>       campaign to effect so-called regime change in </p><p>       Zimbabwe. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>  9.   Under headline "\'Bush\'s visit not critical\': Africa </p><p>      should not be intimidated, says President" the lead </p><p>      story in the July 4 edition of the </p><p>      government-controlled daily "The Herald" reads: </p><p> </p><p>      "Africa should not be intimidated when the U. S. </p><p>      President George Bush visits the </p><p>      continent. . .President Mugabe said (July 3).  `When </p><p>      Bush visits here, it should not send tremors to your </p><p>      nerves,\' he said while addressing the 54th Ordinary </p><p>      Session of the ZANU PF Central Committee.  `He is </p><p>      coming to visit and he would not dare to try what he </p><p>      did to Iraq.  He knows the situation is different. </p><p>      After all we do not have oil,\' he said. . .Of late, </p><p>      the U. S. ha renewed its onslaught against Zimbabwe </p><p>      with President Bush, Secretary of State Mr. Colin </p><p>      Powell and Assistant Secretary of State for African </p><p>      Affairs Mr. Walter Kansteiner calling for President </p><p>      Mugabe\'s exit from power.  `We know that the Bush </p><p>      administration and the Blair government are against </p><p>      this country and its leadership. . .But their </p><p>      conspiracies should never be allowed to succeed and </p><p>      we are glad that Africans oppose that . . . .\'" </p><p> </p><p>  10.  While the rest of the government-controlled and </p><p>      independent print media carried wire articles by </p><p>      U. S.-based news agencies on President Bush\'s </p><p>      remarks at the recent biennial meeting of the </p><p>      Corporate Council on Africa, the July 3 edition of </p><p>      the pro-government weekly "Business Tribune" </p><p>      reproduced the full text of his speech on page 12, </p><p>      under headline "Bush sets agenda for Africa tour: </p><p>      Remarks by U. S. President to the Corporate Council </p><p>      on U. S. (sic) - Africa Business Summit." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
