(C) SUMMARY:  ACCORDING TO THE ZIMBABWEAN FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER, THE APRIL 21 VICTORIA FALLS MEETING WAS </p><p>DESIGNED AS A SUMMIT OF THE HEADS OF STATE OF THE </p><p>EXTERNAL STATE ACTORS TO DISCUSS WAYS OF EXTRICATING </p><p>THEMSELVES FROM THE CONGO.  THE CONGOLESE WERE NOT </p><p>INVITED.  AT THE LAST MOMENT, DOS SANTOS COULD NOT </p><p>ATTEND.  BECAUSE OF HIS PENDING INAUGURATION, KAGAME </p><p>WAS ALSO ABSENT BUT HAD SENT BOTH HIS FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER AND EMMANUEL GASANA.  THE ZIMBABWEAN FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER DESCRIBED THE MEETINGS AS REMARKABLY FRANK </p><p>AND FRIENDLY.  HE REPORTED THAT THE DISCUSSION </p><p>CENTERED ON TWO ISSUES THAT WERE VIEWED AS CENTRAL TO </p><p>A RESOLUTION OF THE DRC CONFLICT: THE DISARMAMENT OF </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02200  01 OF 05  221924Z </p><p>THE EX-FAR/INTERHAMWE, AND THE MOUNTING OF THE </p><p>SUCCESSFUL MASIRE-FACILITATED INTER-CONGOLESE </p><p>DIALOGUE.  THE VIC FALLS PARTICIPANTS ALSO DISCUSSED </p><p>WAYS OF SELF-ENFORCING THE KAMPALA CEASE-FIRE </p><p>AGREEMENT PENDING SECOND PHASE MONUC DEPLOYMENT AND, </p><p>IN PARTICULAR, OF INSURING THAT NEITHER STATE ARMIES </p><p>NOR NON-SIGNATORY FORCES WOULD VIOLATE THE 30 </p><p>KILOMETER DEMILITARIZED ZONE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) ON APRIL 22,2000, S/E WOLPE, ACCOMPANIED BY </p><p>LT. COL. GADDIS, SPECIAL ADVISOR PRENDERGAST, THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR AND ECONOFF (NOTETAKER), MET FOR TWO HOURS </p><p>WITH ZIMBABWEAN FOREIGN MINISTER STAN MUDENGE TO </p><p>REVIEW RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE LUSAKA PEACE </p><p>PROCESS AND THE RECENT POLITICAL DETERIORATION IN </p><p>ZIMBABWE.  THE EXTENDED AND AT TIMES EMOTIONAL </p><p>EXCHANGE ON ZIMBABWE\'S DOMESTIC SITUATION IS REPORTED </p><p>SEPTEL. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>WOLPE: LOCKING IN THE KAMPALA AGREEMENT </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) WOLPE OPENED WITH A BRIEF DISCUSSION OF THE </p><p>PURPOSE OF HIS CURRENT MISSION, MAKING THE FOLLOWING </p><p>POINTS: </p><p> </p><p>-- ZIMBABWE WAS TO BE CONGRATULATED ON ITS ROLE IN </p><p>BRINGING ABOUT THE RECENT KAMPALA CEASE- </p><p>FIRE/DISENGAGEMENT AGREEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02200  01 OF 05  221924Z </p><p>-- THE USG RECOGNIZED THAT A SUSTAINABLE AGREEMENT </p><p>REQUIRED GOOD FAITH EFFORTS ON ALL SIDES, AND THE </p><p>CONTINUED ENCOURAGEMENT AND COMMITMENT OF THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE USG WANTED TO DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO INSURE </p><p>THAT THE MOMENTUM GENERATED BY THE KAMPALA AGREEMENTS </p><p>WAS SUSTAINED.  IN HIS REGIONAL VISITS WOLPE WOULD BE </p><p>STRESSING TO ALL PARTIES THE IMPORTANCE OF FULL </p><p>COMPLIANCE WITH THESE AGREEMENTS.  HE ALSO WANTED TO </p><p>EXPLORE POSSIBLE WAYS OF ACCELERATING FULL LUSAKA </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION. </p><p> </p><p>--THE UPCOMING UNSC MISSION LED BY AMBASSADOR </p><p>HOLBROOKE TO KINSHASA AND LUSAKA WAS SIMILARLY </p><p>DESIGNED TO SUSTAIN THE NEW MOMENTUM.  THIS WAS A </p><p>CRITICAL MISSION WHICH, IF IT COULD REPORT </p><p>SUBSTANTIVE PROGRESS ON THE GROUND, WOULD SET THE </p><p>STAGE FOR SECOND PHASE MONUC DEPLOYMENT. </p><p> </p><p>--THE USG WAS SEEKING NOT ONLY SHORT-TERM </p><p>DISENGAGEMENT ON THE GROUND, BUT THE FULL </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION OF THE LUSAKA AGREEMENT.

(C) FOLLOWING S/E WOLPE\'S EXPLANATION OF THE </p><p>PURPOSE OF HIS CURRENT MISSION TO REGIONAL CAPITALS </p><p>-- TO STRESS THE IMPORTANCE OF FULL COMPLIANCE WITH </p><p>THE RECENT CEASE-FIRE/DISENGAGEMENT AGREEMENTS </p><p>REACHED AT KAMPALA, AND TO EXPLORE WITH REGIONAL </p><p>LEADERS WAYS OF ACCELERATING THE FULL IMPLEMENTATION </p><p>OF THE LUSAKA ACCORD -- MUDENGE GAVE A READ-OUT OF </p><p>THE PREVIOUS DAY\'S VICTORIA FALLS MEETING.  MUDENGE </p><p>SAID THAT THE VIC FALLS GATHERING WAS THE OUTGROWTH </p><p>OF CONVERSATIONS THAT HAD OCCURRED ON THE MARGINS OF </p><p>THE CAIRO MEETING BETWEEN CHISSANO, DOS SANTOS, </p><p>MUSEVENI, AND MUGABE.  ALL AGREED IT WAS TIME FOR THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02200  02 OF 05  221924Z </p><p>EXTERNAL PARTIES TO SIT DOWN AND DISCUSS WAYS OF </p><p>ENDING THE WAR AND GETTING OUT OF THE DRC.  ALL OF </p><p>THE EXTERNAL LUSAKA SIGNATORIES -- BUT NO CONGOLESE - </p><p>- WERE INVITED TO VICTORIA FALLS.  UNFORTUNATELY, AT </p><p>THE LAST MINUTE DOS SANTOS COULD NOT COME.  KAGAME, </p><p>WHO WAS DEALING WITH HIS INAUGURAL PREPARATIONS, </p><p>APOLOGIZED FOR HIS ABSENCE, AND HAD SENT BOTH HIS </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER AND EMMANUEL GASANA.  KAGAME HAD IN </p><p>FACT INDICATED HIS AVAILABILITY FOR AN EXTERNAL HEADS </p><p>OF STATE MEETING IF IT WERE HELD ON A DIFFERENT DAY, </p><p>BUT IT WAS DECIDED TO GO AHEAD AS SCHEDULED.  IT WAS </p><p>MOZAMBICAN PRESIDENT CHISSANO (CURRENTLY THE HEAD OF </p><p>SADC) WHO FACILITATED THE VIC FALLS DISCUSSION. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) MUDENGE SAID THE MEETING HAD NO AGENDA OTHER </p><p>THAN A DISCUSSION OF WHAT WAS REQUIRED FOR ALL OF THE </p><p>EXTERNAL PARTIES TO GET OUT OF THE CONGO.  HE </p><p>DESCRIBED THE MEETING AS EXCEPTIONALLY FRANK AND </p><p>FRIENDLY -- THE FRIENDLIEST SUCH GATHERING HE HAD </p><p>EVER OBSERVED.  HE REGRETTED KAGAME\'S ABSENCE -- </p><p>WHICH HE EMPHASIZED WAS FOR "VERY UNDERSTANDABLE </p><p>REASONS" -- BECAUSE HE WOULD HAVE LIKED THE RWANDAN </p><p>PRESIDENT TO PERSONALLY EXPERIENCE THE REMARKABLE </p><p>CANDOR AND POSITIVE ATMOSPHERICS OF THE SESSION. </p><p>ACCORDING TO MUDENGE, ALL APPEARED INTENT ON BEING AS </p><p>HONEST AS POSSIBLE, ON LAYING OUT THEIR BOTTOM LINES, </p><p>ON FINDING A WAY OUT OF THE CONGO. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>THE FIRST BOTTOM LINE: THE DISARMAMENT OF THE EX- </p><p>FAR/INTERHAMWE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02200  02 OF 05  221924Z </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) MUDENGE SAID THAT THE DISCUSSION AMONG THE </p><p>VIC FALLS PARTICIPANTS QUICKLY ZEROED IN ON WHAT WERE </p><p>UNDERSTOOD TO BE THE TWO CENTRAL CONCERNS REQUIRING </p><p>RESOLUTION: THE DISARMAMENT OF THE EX- </p><p>FAR/INTERAHAMWE, AND THE INTER-CONGOLESE DIALOGUE. </p><p>VARIOUS IDEAS WERE PUT ON THE TABLE, AND THE </p><p>CONVERSATION GRADUALLY MOVED FROM A DISCUSSION OF </p><p>MAXIMAL OBJECTIVES TO WHAT WAS IN FACT ACHIEVABLE. </p><p>MUSEVENI AND THE RWANDANS, FOR EXAMPLE, INITIALLY </p><p>FOCUSED ON THE NEED TO TRACK DOWN ALL EX- </p><p>FAR/INTERAHAMWE FIGHTERS.  OTHERS, HOWEVER, ARGUED </p><p>THIS WAS UNREALISTIC.  "NO ONE HAS THE CAPACITY TO </p><p>HUNT DOWN THESE PEOPLE," MUDENGE ASSERTED.  HOWEVER, </p><p>THREE OTHER PROPOSITIONS WERE DISCUSSED: </p><p> </p><p>-- THE NEED TO INDIVIDUALIZE THE CULPABILITY OF </p><p>GENOCIDAIRES, AND TO END THE BLANKET LABELLING OF THE </p><p>ENTIRE GROUP OF EX-FAR/INTERAHAMWE STILL IN THE DRC </p><p>AS GENOCIDAIRES.  AS MUDENGE PUT IT, "IF WE KNOW THAT </p><p>A SPECIFIC INDIVIDUAL STANDS ACCUSED OF GENOCIDE, </p><p>THEN WE CAN COOPERATE TO INSURE THAT HE IS BROUGHT TO </p><p>JUSTICE."

THESE SPECIFIC ISSUES WOULD HAVE TO BE </p><p>DISCUSSED WITH KAGAME PRESENT. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE NEED FOR CONDITIONS TO BE CREATED INSIDE </p><p>UGANDA, RWANDA AND BURUNDI THAT WOULD ALLOW THE </p><p>LARGEST NUMBER OF THESE HUTU FIGHTERS TO RETURN HOME </p><p>SAFELY. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A BROADER CLIMATE OF PEACE </p><p>AND CONFIDENCE IN THE GREAT LAKES REGION WOULD </p><p>ULTIMATELY MAKE IT EASIER TO DEAL WITH THE EX- </p><p>FAR/INTERAHAMWE PROBLEM. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) ASKED HOW THE RWANDANS HAD RESPONDED TO THESE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02200  03 OF 05  221924Z </p><p>POINTS, MUDENGE SAID THAT THE FOREIGN MINISTER TOOK </p><p>CAREFUL NOTES BUT DID NOT COMMENT DIRECTLY.  MUDENGE </p><p>AGAIN EXPRESSED HIS REGRET AT KAGAME\'S ABSENCE, </p><p>NOTING THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HELPFUL TO HAVE THE </p><p>RWANDAN PRESIDENT\'S PERSONAL REACTION. (MUDENGE ALSO </p><p>EXPRESSED UNCERTAINTY AS TO WHO HIS PRIMARY RWANDAN </p><p>INTERLOCUTOR WOULD BE IN THE AFTERMATH OF PATRICK </p><p>MAZIMHAKA\'S DEPARTURE FROM THE CABINET.  THE GOR MUST </p><p>GROW ON ITS OWN, ACCORDING TO MUDENGE, AND INTERACT </p><p>WITH OTHER COUNTRIES IN ITS OWN WAY; THIS CAN BE </p><p>FRUSTRATING TO OTHERS, INCLUDING THE UGANDANS.) </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) AT ONE POINT, MUDENGE SAID, NAMIBIAN </p><p>PRESIDENT NUJOMA HALF JOKINGLY ("BUT ALSO HALF </p><p>SERIOUSLY") PROPOSED THAT EX-FAR/INTERHAMWE COULD BE </p><p>RESETTLED IN LAND-ABUNDANT NAMIBIA.  MUDENGE SAID </p><p>THAT IN HIS VIEW THE RESETTLEMENT OF THESE ELEMENTS </p><p>INSIDE THE DRC ITSELF WAS A NON-STARTER BECAUSE OF </p><p>THE NEED TO DENY THE EX-FAR/INTERAHAMWE ACCESS TO THE </p><p>RWANDAN BORDER; HOWEVER, LOCATIONS MORE DISTANT FROM </p><p>RWANDA SHOULD BE CONSIDERED.  THE KEY, HE SAID, WAS </p><p>THE NEED TO "SMASH THE SUPPORTIVE STRUCTURES" OF THE </p><p>EX-FAR/INTERAHAMWE, SOMETHING WITH WHICH HE AND </p><p>PATRICK MAZIMHAKA HAD AGREED AT THE TIME OF THE </p><p>SIGNING OF THE LUSAKA AGREEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>THE SECOND BOTTOM LINE: THE INTER-CONGOLESE DIALOGUE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) THE SECOND CENTRAL ISSUE UPON WHICH THE VIC </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02200  03 OF 05  221924Z </p><p>FALLS PARTICIPANTS FOCUSSED WAS THE NEED TO HAVE A </p><p>SUCCESSFUL NATIONAL DIALOGUE THAT WOULD NOT BE </p><p>OBSTRUCTED BY KABILA.  MUDENGE SAID THAT EVERYONE </p><p>WOULD HAVE TO ACCEPT THE FACT THAT A DEEPLY </p><p>SUSPICIOUS AND MISTRUSTFUL KABILA WOULD CONTINUE TO </p><p>TRY TO DO HIS THING.  KABILA WAS ONE WHO INSISTED ON </p><p>"TRUST AND VERIFY" AS HIS MODUS OPERANDI.  MUDENGE </p><p>SAID IT WAS CASTRO THAT HAD ONCE OBSERVED THAT KABILA </p><p>MAY NOT TRUST ANYONE, BUT THAT WAS VERY LIKELY WHY HE </p><p>HAD SURVIVED ALL OF THOSE YEARS IN THE BUSH.  IN </p><p>RESPONSE TO WOLPE\'S QUERY AS TO HOW THE ALLIES WOULD </p><p>DEAL WITH THE PROBLEMS OF NON-COMPLIANCE PRESENTED BY </p><p>KABILA, MUDENGE INSISTED THAT THIS WOULD NOT BE A BIG </p><p>PROBLEM. </p><p> </p><p>9.

IT WAS AGREED </p><p>THAT THIS ZONE HAD TO BE TOTALLY FREE NOT ONLY OF </p><p>STATE MILITARY FORCES BUT ALSO OF THE EX- </p><p>FAR/INTERAHAMWE AND OTHER SUCH ELEMENTS..  EVERY </p><p>PARTY HAD TO ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY THROUGH MECHANISMS </p><p>SUCH AS THE RJMC\'S OR JOINT PATROLS, FOR WHICH </p><p>RESOURCES ARE NEEDED -- PARTICULARLY IF MONUC PHASE </p><p>TWO DEPLOYMENT SHOULD BE FURTHER DELAYED.

(C) MUDENGE OBSERVED THAT THIS TASK OF SELF- </p><p>POLICING WAS MADE MORE DIFFICULT BY THE CONTINUING </p><p>REFUSAL OF RWANDA AND RCD-GOMA TO PARTICIPATE IN THE </p><p>REGIONAL JMC\'S.  ACCORDING TO MUDENGE, RWANDA AND THE </p><p>RCD-GOMA HAVE BLAMED A LACK OF RESOURCES FOR THEIR </p><p>NON-PARTICIPATION, AS WELL AS THEIR LACK OF FAITH IN </p><p>SELF-MONITORING MECHANISMS.  BUT, WHATEVER THE </p><p>REASON, IT WAS CAUSING DIFFICULTIES ON THE GROUND. </p><p>PRENDERGAST AND WOLPE UNDERTOOK TO DISCUSS THIS </p><p>SUBJECT IN KIGALI. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) MUDENGE SAID THAT ALL OF THE LEADERS AT </p><p>VICTORIA FALLS PROFESSED CURRENT SATISFACTION WITH </p><p>THE CEASE-FIRE OBSERVANCE.  ACCORDING TO MUDENGE, THE </p><p>ONLY NEGATIVE NOTE WAS SOUNDED BY ZIMBABWEAN DEFENSE </p><p>MINISTER MAHACHI WHO CLAIMED THAT THERE HAD BEEN AN </p><p>ATTACK ON IKELA AFTER THE APRIL 14 CEASE-FIRE </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION DATE.  MUSEVENI SAID HE THOUGHT </p><p>MAHACHI MAY HAVE BEEN REFERRING TO AN ATTACK THAT HAD </p><p>OCCURRED PRIOR TO THE CEASE-FIRE DEADLINE.  MAHACHI, </p><p>HOWEVER, INSISTED THAT THERE WAS A LATER ATTACK THAT </p><p>WAS A VIOLATION OF THE CEASE-FIRE AGREEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>IT\'S THE ATMOSPHERICS, STUPID </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C) THE VICTORIA FALLS PARTICIPANTS DID NOT </p><p>REACH ANY FORMAL DECISIONS, THE FOREIGN MINISTER </p><p>SAID.

IF </p><p>THERE IS RAPPORT AMONG THE EXTERNAL PARTIES, MUDENGE </p><p>SAID, KABILA WILL HAVE TO GO ALONG.  "I BELIEVE WE </p><p>(THE EXTERNAL PARTIES) CAN BE CONSTRUCTIVE FOR THE </p><p>DRC."  STRESSING THE EXCELLENT ATMOSHPERICS OF THE </p><p>VIC FALLS MEETING, MUDENGE ADDED THAT THOSE WHO HAD </p><p>TURNED UP HAPPENED TO BE PARTICULARLY COMFORTABLE </p><p>WITH ONE ANOTHER.  THE VICTORIA FALLS PARTICIPANTS </p><p>AGREED THAT CHISSANO WOULD REPORT ON THEIR MEETING TO </p><p>ZAMBIAN PRESIDENT CHILUBA WHO WILL THEN BE ASKED TO </p><p>CONVENE A LARGER MEETING OF ALL OF THE LUSAKA </p><p>PARTIES. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>14.
