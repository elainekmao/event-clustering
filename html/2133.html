<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L HARARE 003286 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR CHARLES GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR CHARLES NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR TERRY PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/02/11 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: ZIMBABWE RULING PARTY DUE TO TABLE LEGISLATION </p><p>BANNING POLITICAL FUNDING OF NGOS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY POLITICAL OFFICER TODD FAULK FOR REASONS: </p><p>1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) IN A LUNCH MEETING WITH POLOFF NOVEMBER 1, NEW </p><p>DEPUTY JUSTICE MINISTER PAUL MANGWANA -- AND ZANU-PF </p><p>MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT -- REVEALED THAT HIS MINISTRY IS </p><p>CURRENTLY DRAFTING LEGISLATION THAT WOULD BAN FOREIGN </p><p>FUNDING CHANNELED THROUGH NGOS FOR "POLITICAL TASKS," </p><p>SUCH AS VOTER EDUCATION.  HOWEVER, THE LEGISLATION WOULD </p><p>CLEARLY EXEMPT MONEY HEADED TO NGOS FOR USE IN </p><p>HUMANITARIAN EFFORTS, MANGWANA SAID.  A PREVIOUS BILL </p><p>THAT WOULD BAN ALL FOREIGN FUNDING OF NGOS IS NO LONGER </p><p>UNDER CONSIDERATION.  THE DEPUTY MINISTER INTIMATED THAT </p><p>THE BILL IS DESIGNED TO PROTECT ZIMBABWE\'S SOVEREIGNTY. </p><p>IT IS NOT FOR FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS TO INTERFERE IN </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S ELECTORAL PROCESSES; IT IS UP TO THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE ALONE TO "EDUCATE" VOTERS, HE </p><p>STATED.  THE JUSTICE MINISTRY IS PLANNING ON SUBMITTING </p><p>THE BILL TO PARLIAMENT BY DECEMBER SO THAT IT CAN BE </p><p>PASSED BEFORE THE CHRISTMAS RECESS, MANGWANA CONCLUDED. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) COMMENT:  BY DUMPING A BLANKET BAN ON FOREIGN </p><p>NGO FUNDING AND DIFFERENTIATING BETWEEN "POLITICAL" AND </p><p>"HUMANITARIAN" NGOS IN NEW LEGISLATION, THE GOZ APPEARS </p><p>TO BE BOWING TO THE REALITY OF LOOMING FOOD SHORTAGES IN </p><p>THE COUNTRY AND THE NEED FOR FOREIGN NGO HELP.  IT IS </p><p>UNCLEAR WHETHER FUNDING FOR SPECIFIC NGOS WILL BE </p><p>BANNED, OR JUST CATEGORIES OF ORGANIZATIONS.  IT IS ALSO </p><p>UNCLEAR HOW "POLITICAL TASKS" MAY BE DEFINED IN THE </p><p>FINAL LEGISLATION.  IN ANY CASE, IT WILL PROBABLY PROVE </p><p>IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE GOZ TO TRACK HOW FOREIGN FUNDS GOING </p><p>TO ZIMBABWEAN NGOS ARE USED -- ALL IT WILL NEED IS A </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03286  021059Z </p><p>LEGAL PRETEXT AND A SUSPICION TO SHUT DOWN ORGANIZATIONS </p><p>ENGAGED IN ACTIVITIES IT CONSIDERS A THREAT TO ITS </p><p>CONTINUED HOLD ON POWER.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) BIO NOTE:  PAUL MANGWANA, THE ZANU-PF MP FOR </p><p>KADOMA EAST, WAS MOVED FROM THE DEPUTY SLOT AT THE </p><p>MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS TO THE </p><p>RECONSTITUTED POSITION OF DEPUTY JUSTICE MINISTER IN THE </p><p>JULY 2001 CABINET RESHUFFLE.  MANGWANA, IN HIS LATE </p><p>THIRTIES, CAN BE CONSIDERED A "YOUNG TURK" IN ZANU-PF </p><p>WHO HAS ADMITTED THAT HE WOULD RATHER CHANGE THE SYSTEM </p><p>FROM WITHIN THAN FROM WITHOUT.  MANGWANA OWNS A CHICKEN- </p><p>PRODUCTION BUSINESS AND IS WELL-OFF.  THE DEPUTY </p><p>MINISTER IS A LAWYER BY TRAINING AND ENTERED PRIVATE </p><p>PRACTICE WITH CURRENT JUSTICE MINISTER PATRICK CHINAMASA </p><p>IN 1986.  HE WAS ELECTED TO PARLIAMENT FOR THE FIRST </p><p>TIME IN 2000.  END BIO NOTE. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
