<p>UNCLAS AMMAN 002802 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR ECA A/S PATRICIA HARRISON FROM AMBASSADOR EDWARD W. </p><p>GHNEM </p><p>FOR ECA/A/L (WILGUS, JANET), NEA/PPD (BAROODY, JUDITH), </p><p>NEA/ARN, NEA/EX </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: OEXC, SCUL, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: CHIEF OF MISSION SUPPORT FOR AMMAN AMERICAN </p><p>LANGUAGE CENTER </p><p> </p><p>1.   I STRONGLY SUPPORT AMERICAN EMBASSY AMMAN\'S DIRECT </p><p>  ENGLISH TEACHING PROGRAM AND THE CONTINUED OPERATION OF </p><p>  THE  AMERICAN  LANGUAGE  CENTER  (ALC)  AS  A  PUBLIC </p><p>  DIPLOMACY TOOL.  THE ALC\'S GOAL TO BECOME A MODEL  OF </p><p>  ENGLISH TEACHING IN THE REGION WILL INCREASE THE ALC\'S </p><p>  ABILITY  TO  CHANNEL TUITION PROFITS INTO  DISCOUNTED </p><p>  ENGLISH LANGUAGE PROGRAMS FOR TARGETED AUDIENCES SUCH </p><p>  AS THE MEDIA AND MINISTRY OF EDUCATION TEACHERS.  THIS </p><p>  GOAL DIRECTLY ADVANCES MPP GOALS AND IS WHY POST WOULD </p><p>  LIKE TO SEE THE ALC CONTINUE AS PART OF THE MISSION. </p><p> </p><p>2.     MY  PREDECESSOR,  NOW  NEA  ASSISTANT  SECRETARY </p><p>  WILLIAM BURNS, HELD A SIMILAR VIEW.  IN A FEBRUARY 2000 </p><p>  MEMO TO ECA, HE WROTE: "THIS PROGRAM DIRECTLY FURTHERS </p><p>  OUR MPP GOALS, INCLUDING SUPPORT FOR JORDAN\'S POLITICAL </p><p>  LIBERALIZATION EFFORT, ECONOMIC GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT, </p><p>  AND   INSTITUTION   BUILDING.    THE   ALC   PROVIDES </p><p>  PROFESSIONAL,  SPECIALIZED,  ISSUE-SPECIFIC  LANGUAGE </p><p>  INSTRUCTION  TO  POTENTIAL  DECISION-MAKERS  IN   THE </p><p>  JORDANIAN  BODY  POLITIC, INCLUDING PARLIAMENTARIANS, </p><p>  MEMBERS OF THE LEGAL PROFESSION AND CIVIL SERVANTS FROM </p><p>  THE MINISTRIES OF FINANCE AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS." </p><p> </p><p>3.    TWO  YEARS LATER, THE ALC CONTINUES TO STRENGTHEN </p><p>  ITS  ALREADY EFFECTIVE PROGRAM.  ITS LATEST  AMERICAN </p><p>  TEACHING  METHODS, UPDATED COMPUTER LAB AND  INTERNET </p><p>  STATIONS,  AND PROFESSIONAL STAFF ENABLE THE  ALC  TO </p><p>  PROVIDE STATE-OF-THE-ART ENGLISH LANGUAGE TRAINING TO </p><p>  JORDANIANS  THAT  ASSISTS THEM  IN  PARTICIPATING  IN </p><p>  TODAY\'S  GLOBAL  ECONOMY. THE ALC\'S  EDUCATIONAL  AND </p><p>  CULTURAL  OUTREACH EFFORTS ALSO HAVE THE  ABILITY  TO </p><p>  REMAIN  ABOVE  THE POLITICAL FRAY IN THIS  PERIOD  OF </p><p>  INCREASING REGIONAL TENSIONS.  ENROLLMENT IS ACTUALLY </p><p>  GROWING.   ON APRIL 14, 2002, THE BEGINNING OF  ALC\'S </p><p>  MOST  RECENT SESSION AND DURING THE PEAK OF  REGIONAL </p><p>  CRISIS, THE ALC ENROLLED 448 STUDENTS - A RECORD NUMBER </p><p>  FOR JUST ONE 8-WEEK SESSION. </p><p> </p><p>4.    I  UNDERSTAND THE ALC MUST TRANSITION FROM  USING </p><p>  BLANKET  PURCHASE AGREEMENTS (BPA\'S)  TO  NEW  HIRING </p><p>  PROCEDURES TO COMPLY WITH IRS REGULATIONS.   JULY  1, </p><p>  2002 IMPLEMENTATION DATE FOR CONVERSION OF 5 FULL-TIME </p><p>  AND  11 PART-TIME EMPLOYEES TO PSA WOULD INCREASE THE </p><p>  ALC PORTION OF PD\'S ICASS BILL BY ABOUT 11,200 DOLS IN </p><p>  FY-2002 (PARTIAL YEAR).  THE FULL-YEAR INCREASE  (FY- </p><p>  2003) IS ESTIMATED AT $16,600.  NOTE, HOWEVER, THAT THE </p><p>  FULL-YEAR  ESTIMATE DEVELOPED BY THE  ICASS  SOFTWARE </p><p>  COULD BE UNDERSTATED BY AS MUCH AS 40 PERCENT BECAUSE </p><p>  INSUFFICIENT  INFORMATION  EXISTS  AT  THIS  TIME  TO </p><p>  CALCULATE ITEMS SUCH AS OVERHEAD AND DISTRIBUTED COSTS. </p><p>  POST BELIEVES THAT THE ALC CAN SUPPORT THE ADDED COSTS </p><p>  OF  HIRING TEACHERS USING PERSONAL SERVICE AGREEMENTS </p><p>  (PSA).  THE ALC HAD MORE THAN A $100,000 CARRY OVER IN </p><p>  FY-01. </p><p> </p><p>5.     AN  INCREASE  IN THE SIZE OF THE  MISSION  ICASS </p><p>  STAFF MIGHT/MIGHT BE NEEDED TO SUPPORT THE NEW PAS ALC </p><p>  POSITIONS, DEPENDING UPON THE TIMING.  ACCORDING TO THE </p><p>  ICASS  NSDD-38  MODULE,  THE  CONVERSION  OF  16  ALC </p><p>  EMPLOYEES  TO PAS WOULD RESULT IN A NEED  FOR  A  .48 </p><p>  (POINT FORTY-EIGHT) INCREASE IN THE LES SUPPORT STAFF. </p><p>  WHICH  AGENCY  PAYS  THE  FIRST-YEAR  COSTS  FOR  THE </p><p>  ADDITIONAL POSITION(S) WILL DEPEND UPON THE ORDER  IN </p><p>  WHICH   THE   STAFFING  INCREASES  ARE   IMPLEMENTED. </p><p>  WHICHEVER STAFFING INCREASE RESULTS IN THE NEED FOR AN </p><p>  ADDITIONAL FULL-TIME LES POSITION WILL PAY THE  COSTS </p><p>  FOR THE FIRST YEAR.  SINCE THE POSITION COSTS WOULD BE </p><p>  SPREAD  AMONG ALL ICASS PARTICIPANTS IN THE FOLLOWING </p><p>  FISCAL YEAR, THE POST ICASS COUNCIL MUST APPROVE  ANY </p><p>  STAFF INCREASES. </p><p> </p><p>6.    IT APPEARS TO ME THAT THE ALC IS AN EFFICIENT AND </p><p>  EFFECTIVE  PUBLIC  DIPLOMACY  TOOL  THAT   WORKS.   I </p><p>  APPRECIATE  EFFORTS BY THE BUREAU  OF  EDUCATION  AND </p><p>  CULTURAL  AFFAIRS (ECA) TO FIND WAYS  TO  ENSURE  THE </p><p>  CONTINUED VIABILITY OF THE ALC IN AMMAN. </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
