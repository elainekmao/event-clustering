<p>UNCLAS TEGUCIGALPA 001462 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR WHA/CEN, EB, DS, AND INR </p><p>STATE PASS TO USTR </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, ETRD, SOCI, PREL, ECON, ELAB, ASEC, PINR, HO </p><p>SUBJECT: ANTI-CAFTA PROTEST ANTICLIMACTIC </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  Only 100-200 protesters turned out on June 18 to voice </p><p>their opposition to CAFTA negotiations, signaling that there </p><p>is little focused, popular resistance in Honduras to the </p><p>U.S.-Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA).  The </p><p>demonstration, which so far has been the only organized </p><p>protest to occur during this round of talks, went on for less </p><p>than two hours outside the conference hotel and ended after </p><p>lead Honduran CAFTA negotiator Melvin Redondo met with </p><p>protest leaders. </p><p> </p><p>2.  EmbOffs, having received notice by e-mail had alerted </p><p>delegates by mid-day that there would be an afternoon protest </p><p>in front of the main entrance of the Clarion hotel.  By 4:00 </p><p>p.m. the protest was underway, with demonstrators blocking </p><p>traffic in front of the hotel and carrying ten-foot-tall red </p><p>banners denouncing CAFTA and the Free Trade Area of the </p><p>Americas.  The protest was organized by the Popular Block </p><p>(PB), a left-leaning organization that claims to represent </p><p>teachers and workers, whose leader, Carlos H. Reyes, read a </p><p>declaration to the press.  Congresswoman Doris Gutierrez, who </p><p>belongs to the small Democratic Unification Party (a remnant </p><p>of the 1980s socialist movement), also addressed </p><p>demonstrators. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Eyewitnesses estimate that police outnumbered protesters </p><p>2-1, with uniformed officers surrounding the entire hotel. </p><p>The police nearest to the demonstration wore helmets, carried </p><p>riot shields, and were armed with batons rather than </p><p>firearms.  The protest subsided after lead Honduran CAFTA </p><p>negotiator Melvin Redondo met with protest leaders and </p><p>received a list of their grievances. </p><p> </p><p>4.  COMMENT:  The lone anti-CAFTA protest during this round </p><p>of negotiations turned out to be a non-event.  The small </p><p>number of demonstrators stopped traffic on one street and </p><p>delivered their standard anti-free trade message, but talks </p><p>were not impeded in any way.  This level of protest indicates </p><p>that here in Tegucigalpa CAFTA is an issue too nebulous to </p><p>inspire extensive resistance, and attests to the lack of </p><p>widespread, organized opposition to CAFTA in Honduras.  In a </p><p>conversation with LabAtt June 19, labor leader Dinora </p><p>Aceituno (CTH Secretary General) dismissed the demonstration </p><p>as ineffective and counterproductive.  END COMMENT </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
