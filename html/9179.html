<p>S E C R E T ANKARA 004231 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/05/2013 </p><p>TAGS: MOPS, PREL, TU, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: ARREST OF TURKISH SF CLOSES BORDER </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 4230 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by DCM Robert Deutsch, reasons 1.5, b/d. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Baghdad minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) Ambassador spoke with MFA Acting U/S Baki Ilkin the </p><p>morning of July 5 concerning the arrest of Turkish Special </p><p>Forces in Iraq (reftel).  Ilkin said that US military </p><p>authorities in northern Iraq told the Turkish Liaison team </p><p>with the 173rd in Iraq that an unidentified group of Turks </p><p>had been arrested and that those held could be released if </p><p>they were identified and if there were a request for release </p><p>through diplomatic channels.  Ilkin reported that the </p><p>American unit involved was observed Friday morning in Kirkuk </p><p>training to storm buildings.  After a number of repetitions, </p><p>they headed for Suleimaniya accompanied by PUK security with </p><p>a convoy totaling some 40 vehicles.  They entered the </p><p>building housing the Turkish SF behind two smoke bombs. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) In contact with OCPA chief of staff, Ambassador was </p><p>unable to confirm the offer allegedly made to the Turkish </p><p>Liaison team to release the suspects if identified.  From </p><p>Baghdad, we understand that the investigation of the alleged </p><p>participation of one of the Turkish Special Forces in a plot </p><p>to assassinate the mayor of Kirkuk is continuing. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (S) We have indications from US military sources that an </p><p>additional raid in which another 10 Turkish Special Forces </p><p>were possibly taken into custody may have occurred the </p><p>morning of July 5.  We also understand that the Turks have </p><p>closed and secured the Habur gate with armed guards as a </p><p>result of this incident.  BG Kilicarslan, Deputy Commander of </p><p>the Turkish Special Forces is on his way to Suleimaniya with </p><p>a delegation of 16 people in three cars to meet with PUK "PM" </p><p>Barham Seleh and check on the situation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) The mainstream Turkish "Hurriyet" newspaper this </p><p>morning contained a banner front page report of the incident </p><p>noting the US allegations of an assassination plot.  PM </p><p>Erdogan called the event "an extremely distressing incident" </p><p>and "not acceptable."  DCHOD general Buyukanit said the story </p><p>is regrettably true.  He categorized the allegation that </p><p>Turks were plotting an assassination of the Governor of </p><p>Kirkuk as nonsense.  One news report said Secretary Powell </p><p>told Gul that whatever was necessary would be done.  Another </p><p>claimed that as a result US officials have pressed for </p><p>Turkey\'s military withdrawal from Iraq.  Journalists have </p><p>begun pressing the Embassy for a reaction. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (S) Comment:  Based on the conversations the evening of </p><p>July 4 between FM Gul and the Secretary, CHOD Gen Ozkok and </p><p>EUCOMCDR Gen Jones, the Turkish leadership believes that the </p><p>American senior leadership is now working to resolve this </p><p>incident expeditiously.  This expectation and the relative </p><p>calm of a weekend provide a short period in which the </p><p>incident could be brought to a conclusion.  However, if the </p><p>incident is not resolved and the Turkish Special Forces are </p><p>not released by Monday morning, there will be a rapidly </p><p>accelerating political and public reaction in Turkey that </p><p>would seriously damage to US Turkish relations with broad </p><p>repercussions.  Embassy Ankara is ready for any action that </p><p>can contribute to resolving the issue within the next 48 </p><p>hours. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
