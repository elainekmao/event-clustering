END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Minister of Government and Justice, Dr. Jorge Ramon </p><p>Hernandez Alcerro, hosted a lunch at his home for Ambassador </p><p>Palmer on February 14.  Hernandez requested the meeting to </p><p>discuss issues of bilateral importance.  Also attending the </p><p>lunch were Vice Minister of Government and Justice, Cesar </p><p>Gonzalez, Congressman Hugo Vasquez, and USAID Director. </p><p>Dominating the discussion was the recent turmoil in the </p><p>Honduran Municipal Association (AMHON) and the effort </p><p>underway to replace its Executive Director, Guadalupe Lopez. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Over the past month, political pressure has been </p><p>mounting from the Nationalist Party to remove Lopez, a </p><p>former Liberal Party mayor, and replace him with an </p><p>Executive Director that would be more amenable to the </p><p>policies and programs being promoted by the Ministry of </p><p>Government and Justice.  This has entailed active </p><p>solicitation by Maduro administration officials to </p><p>sympathetic AHMON board members to move forward with a </p><p>replacement.  AMHON by-laws do provide for a mechanism to </p><p>remove the Executive Director with a two-thirds majority </p><p>vote of the Board of Directors (16 of the 24 the members). </p><p>However this has never been done before. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) The current AMHON board is configured as follows:  12 </p><p>board members are Nationalist Party (NP) mayors, 11 are </p><p>Liberal Party (LP) mayors, and one is a Christian Democratic </p><p>Party mayor.  The current president of the Board of </p><p>Directors, Oscar Orlando Burgos (NP), Mayor of Yoro, is </p><p>among the active partisan minority advocating the </p><p>Nationalist party line to remove the Executive Director. </p><p>The vice-president, Juan Carlos Elvir (LP), Mayor of Santa </p><p>Rosa de Copan, is leading the opposition within the board, </p><p>arguing for a competitive selection process to replace both </p><p>the Executive and Deputy Director of AMHON. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) Minister Hernandez noted that it was important for </p><p>the Ambassador to understand the Ministry\'s version of the </p><p>developments and made the point of reiterating the </p><p>ministry\'s non-intervention in this or any AMHON issue.  The </p><p>Minister did mention, however, that since last year several </p><p>meetings have taken place with groups of mayors (most likely </p><p>Nationalist Party mayors) who have stated their discontent </p><p>with the Executive Director.  Specific mayoral complaints </p><p>allegedly include fiscal irresponsibility, an accumulation </p><p>of power and influence by the Executive Director, lack of </p><p>transparency with the Board of Directors, and the supposed </p><p>promotion of Mayor Elvir (LP) of Santa Rosa de Copan as the </p><p>next AMHON president.  Congressman Vasquez mentioned that </p><p>members of Congress have also participated in similar </p><p>meetings with mayors.  He emphasized that they too were </p><p>careful in respecting the independence of AMHON and were not </p><p>involved in the particulars of recent decisions. </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) Although Minister Hernandez did not demonstrate an </p><p>overt understanding of the procedures for selecting a new </p><p>executive director, the Ambassador suggested that it would </p><p>be important for the selection process to be an open and </p><p>transparent competition.  The Mission Director noted that </p><p>through USAID-funded technical assistance, </p><p>PriceWaterhouseCoopers had already worked to develop terms </p><p>of reference for the position and had already assisted AMHON </p><p>in the contracting process for other positions.  The </p><p>Ambassador added that it is common to undertake these hiring </p><p>processes with the aide of a professional search firm. </p><p>Minister Hernandez and other GOH representatives </p><p>emphatically agreed that it would be important for this </p><p>contracting process to be openly competed, to adhere to </p><p>transparent procedures and technical criteria, and to </p><p>include the participation of a professional search firm.  In </p><p>relation to this, the Ambassador noted the importance of </p><p>appearances, suggesting that it is not only important for </p><p>one\'s conduct to be correct, but also to take care in </p><p>appearing to conduct oneself correctly. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) COMMENT: While Lopez has come under attack by </p><p>Nationalist Party members, Post has found him to be a person </p><p>of integrity representing the interests of all </p><p>municipalities in AHMON.  If external political pressure is </p><p>successful, the independence of AHMON will be threatened, </p><p>potentially returning the organization to a de-facto </p><p>extension of the central government, as it was pre-1992. </p><p>The political independence of AHMON has been a goal of </p><p>Post\'s support of decentralization efforts.  As such, USAID, </p><p>in conjunction with the international donor community, has </p><p>dedicated significant resources in an attempt to enable the </p><p>organization to provide an alternative voice to the federal </p><p>government at the municipal level.  Post also notes that </p><p>Minister Hernandez\'s importance in the Maduro administration </p><p>appears to be growing, as is his desire to exert more </p><p>control over decentralization efforts.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>PALMER </p><p></p></div>
