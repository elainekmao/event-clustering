SUMMARY: On April 24, PAS Lagos organized a </p><p>  lecture and panel discussion at our auditorium to mark </p><p>  the 2003 Earth Day celebration.  Two panelists </p><p>  delivered addresses on the occasion, the PAO and CAO </p><p>  each introduced short films on the environment, and the </p><p>  IRC distributed colorful Infopacks to provide guests </p><p>  with additional material to stimulate deeper reflection </p><p>  and discussion.  Earth Day posters, the 10-year </p><p>  anniversary series as well as the 2003 set, adorned the </p><p>  lobby and the auditorium.  We awarded Earth Day posters </p><p>  to our first 15 guests.  END SUMMARY. </p><p>2.   Approximately 70 guests attended the PAS Lagos </p><p>  Earth Day event.  With help from the Educational </p><p>  Advising Center (EAC) staff, we were able to reach a </p><p>  younger audience.  Ten students, both high school and </p><p>  undergraduates, were in attendance.  A large delegation </p><p>  from the Lagos State Government attended, including the </p><p>  Director of Environmental Services and a 1997-98 Hubert </p><p>  H. Humphrey fellow.  EXXON/Mobil\'s Director of External </p><p>  Affairs, academics and journalists also participated in </p><p>  the program.  The bulk of the audience came from the </p><p>  NGO sector. </p><p>3.   PAS invited Melissa Cline, the ECONOFF who holds </p><p>  post\'s environment portfolio, to be one of the featured </p><p>  panelists.  Recently returned International Visitor </p><p>  Folashade Jaji was the second panelist and in part </p><p>  shared what she had experienced during the "Sustainable </p><p>  Economic Development and Environmental Protection" </p><p>  program, which took place in January 2003.  Jaji </p><p>  currently leads the Lagos State Ministry for Women\'s </p><p>  Affairs and Poverty Alleviation.  Given her portfolio </p><p>  and recent IV experience, Jaji has briefed the State </p><p>  Ministry for Environment on key issues. </p><p>4.   Cline spoke on land use and regulation, at times </p><p>  comparing critical issues in Lagos to those in her </p><p>  hometown, Washington, DC.  She presented a clear five- </p><p>  point plan to help NGOs, planners and other </p><p>  stakeholders best achieve their goals for sustainable </p><p>  and successful development.  Cline emphasized that all </p><p>  stakeholders (i.e., government, NGOs, businesses and </p><p>  academics) must develop a common agenda in order to </p><p>  achieve a measure of success. </p><p>5.   Jaji spoke about the spirit of volunteerism that </p><p>  she witnessed in the U.S. and how it that spirit has </p><p>  empowered American society, especially in the areas of </p><p>  sustainable development and environmental awareness. </p><p>  Jaji then re-capped her recommendations to Lagos State </p><p>  on how to encourage safe growth in such a rapidly </p><p>  expanding urban area.  "Smart Growth", she remarked, </p><p>  did not necessarily mean "no growth."  In one </p><p>  potentially controversial comment, Jaji also urged the </p><p>  Nigerian government to remain open to genetically </p><p>  modified foods, insisting that they are not detrimental </p><p>  to one\'s health.  Her brief explanation of Lagos </p><p>  State\'s Waste-To-Wealth program helped demonstrate how </p><p>  byproducts of construction need not be dangerous to the </p><p>  environment. </p><p>6.   A very lively discussion took place after the </p><p>  panelists\' presentations.  One guest raised the </p><p>  challenges of raising the environmental consciousness </p><p>  of the poor when they are confronting basic survival </p><p>  issues such as clothing, feeding and housing their </p><p>  families.  Many participants urged the USG to </p><p>  "pressure" the Nigerian government to respect </p><p>  internationally recognized best practices in </p><p>  environmental management.  Ms. Cline opined that </p><p>  Nigerian NGOs were much better placed to undertake a </p><p>  sustained environmental advocacy campaign. </p><p>7.   BACKGROUND: Nigeria has ten cities with over 1 </p><p>  million inhabitants and as such, the nation\'s urban </p><p>  environmental challenges are unique in sub-Saharan </p><p>  African.  Nigeria\'s urban population now equals its </p><p>  rural population; this is an entirely different reality </p><p>  from just a few years ago.  Lagos is not the only city </p><p>  in Nigeria with severe waste and urban sprawl problems, </p><p>  but with a population approaching 15 million, it </p><p>  unquestionably represents the most acute.  PAS </p><p>  deliberately asked panelists to focus on urban issues, </p><p>  and Lagos turned out to be an ideal city in which to </p><p>  hold the event. </p><p>8.   COMMENT: It was interesting to note how many </p><p>  participants, from panelist Jaji to a high school </p><p>  student to an NGO representative, seemed to glorify </p><p>  "the good old days" of environmental awareness under </p><p>  the former military regimes which ruled Nigeria until </p><p>  1999.  Many of them reminisced about the time when </p><p>  Saturdays were dedicated to home clean-ups and </p><p>  Thursdays dedicated to market clean-ups.  Audience </p><p>  members seemed to appreciate the discipline that the </p><p>  past military regimes required from the population on </p><p>  cleanliness and orderliness and counted these two </p><p>  attributes as losses under the current dispensation. </p><p>9.   PAS launched this event as a "celebration" of </p><p>  Earth Day and was not certain how it would turn out. </p><p>  However, PAS was pleased that despite the Easter </p><p>  holiday, election season and rains that morning, </p><p>  turnout was encouraging, and even more reassuring, </p><p>  participants were extremely interested in talking about </p><p>  these issues.  The program ran a half-hour over the </p><p>  programmed time because several participants insisted </p><p>  on making their points.  Many guests requested copies </p><p>  of the speeches delivered, and others extolled the </p><p>  importance of networking, all guests\' contact </p><p>  information be circulated.  In response to this, the IO </p><p>  circulated copies of Cline\'s speech as a press release </p><p>  as well as making it available the next day on the </p><p>  Embassy\'s website.  The CAO also started an email list </p><p>  of all attendees and encouraged them to work together. </p><p>10.  While our Earth Day celebration was a success and </p><p>  PAS will certainly plan events for future years, it </p><p>  might be helpful if more resources are made available </p><p>  for Posts.  While the announcement cable on Earth Day </p><p>  was comprehensive, the websites were not greatly </p><p>  helpful, and PAS had to scramble to find any audio- </p><p>  visual material that was appropriate, in the end using </p><p>  a clip from a 1995 VOA-produced film to at least </p><p>  explain the origins of the day. </p><p>11.  CONCLUSION: Top officers from the Lagos State </p><p>  Government made commitments to do more to ensure a more </p><p>  environmentally -friendly Lagos.  Participants thanked </p><p>  Post for bringing the environmental issues raised to </p><p>  the their attention and for providing a forum for them </p><p>  to learn from the U.S. experience and form a network to </p><p>  protect the Nigerian environment.  NGOs shared valuable </p><p>  information.  Participants agreed to work towards a </p><p>  healthy and sustainable environment in Nigeria and </p><p>  mentioned planning to have a follow-up program. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HINSON-JONES </p><p></p></div>
