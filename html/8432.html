DART Field Team South visited Al Kut from 20 to 22 May </p><p>and participated in three assistance coordination meetings </p><p>that regularly take place in the city.  The meetings </p><p>provided an overview of the issues and needs currently being </p><p>addressed in Wasit Governorate by Coalition forces, local </p><p>Iraqi leadership, and NGOs.  The visit also highlighted a </p><p>critical issue for continued reconstruction efforts at the </p><p>Governorate level in Iraq.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>PRIORITY RESTORATION OF ELECTRICITY </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  The Coalition Civil Affairs Commander described </p><p>restoration of electrical power in Wasit Governorate as the </p><p>most pressing problem.  The goal is to meet an estimated </p><p>Governorate need of 172 megawatts (MW). To date, the </p><p>Governorate only receives 75 MW.  Electricity is being </p><p>acquired through coordination with other regional producers </p><p>(e.g., 50 MW from An Nasiriyah, 15 to 20 MW from Baghdad, </p><p>etc.).  There have been difficulties, however, with </p><p>facilities in Baghdad not providing the promised amount of </p><p>power and unscheduled shut downs affecting other utilities. </p><p>Work continues on restoring 132 regional power lines and </p><p>repairing damaged towers. </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>AGRICULTURE </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  The Coalition Civil Affairs Commander said the purchase </p><p>of locally produced wheat is the region\'s second largest </p><p>problem.  Under the previous regime, the government </p><p>purchased locally grown wheat that was included in food </p><p>rations distributed to the public.  At the town council </p><p>meeting, the Commander expressed the need for the Office of </p><p>Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance (ORHA) to </p><p>consider the intricacies of wheat procurement and the </p><p>immediacy of the problem.  (Comment:  The impact of the </p><p>wheat purchase decision will be felt immediately in the </p><p>south, where the DART observed farmers harvesting throughout </p><p>the region.  End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  Last year\'s crop remains stored in silos but is unusable </p><p>due to mold.  The Commander said the old stock needs to be </p><p>destroyed and policy and procedures established for purchase </p><p>of the new crop.  There was also considerable discussion in </p><p>the town council meeting about the need to stop the </p><p>slaughter of animals inside the market, to re-open the </p><p>slaughterhouses outside the city limits, and to put meat </p><p>inspectors back to work.  Another priority will be to </p><p>procure fertilizer for the yellow corn crop but the Basrah </p><p>fertilizer plant is reportedly not operating due to </p><p>insecurity and damage. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>TELECOMMUNICATIONS </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5.  The Coalition obtained Defense Department funding to </p><p>help the town council purchase telephones for key agencies, </p><p>including the traffic police and court offices.  Four </p><p>hundred and fifty telephone lines have been restored and </p><p>work continues on the installation of a new central </p><p>switchboard.  Phones are being installed in all the schools </p><p>to ensure emergency response capacity.  Several billion </p><p>Iraqi dinars are reported to be in the telecommunications </p><p>accounts.  It appears the money is in the Governate Ministry </p><p>of Telecommunications accounts because the Coalition and </p><p>local treasury personnel are assessing the actual amounts. </p><p> </p><p>6.  The Coalition, using money from seized government bank </p><p>accounts, has begun the payment of April salaries to </p><p>thousands of civil servants.  The Civil Affairs team is </p><p>overseeing the inspection of bank vaults to determine the </p><p>available cash in the city. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>FIRE DEPARTMENT </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  Al Kut\'s fire department responded to its first fire </p><p>since the war ended, and the overall assessment was that the </p><p>response was a success.  The designated Coalition Civil </p><p>Affairs officer (who is also a volunteer fireman in his </p><p>hometown in the United States) noted the department is </p><p>hampered by a lack of radio communications equipment and </p><p>protective gear.   The officer said he is pursuing an idea </p><p>to have fire departments in the United States adopt a </p><p>Governorate\'s fire department and to provide it with </p><p>financial and technical support.  But he said one looming </p><p>problem is the cost of transporting donated equipment and </p><p>supplies. </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>FUEL SUPPLIES </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  Baghdad refineries, the usual source for all fuel in the </p><p>Governorate, continue to operate at less than 50 percent </p><p>capacity.  Coordination of fuel distribution remains a major </p><p>problem.  Propane trucks were sent to Basrah to acquire </p><p>propane gas and were filled but were diverted to Baghdad. </p><p>Meanwhile, the Coalition and local oil industry </p><p>representatives continue to inspect existing gas lines.  Key </p><p>pipelines from An Nasiriyah, for diesel, gas and, propane, </p><p>have been damaged and repairs may take more than a month to </p><p>complete.  Long lines of drivers waiting at gas stations </p><p>have largely disappeared, however, and one reason for the </p><p>change is the sale of gasoline on the black market. </p><p>Apparently, some vendors have tapped into a gas line that </p><p>was full, but abandoned during the Iran-Iraq war.   The fuel </p><p>is over 10 years old and of very poor quality. </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>HEALTH CARE </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  The Director of Al Kut\'s Health Department noted receipt </p><p>of USD 10,000\'s worth of medicines and supplies from the </p><p>International Medical Corps (IMC) that are being distributed </p><p>free of charge in the area\'s hospitals.  The scarcity of </p><p>chronic care drugs, for the treatment of cancer and other </p><p>diseases, however, remains a problem, and some people are </p><p>resorting to the purchase of medicines on the black market. </p><p>The Director praised the DART for the recent signing of an </p><p>agreement with IMC for the rehabilitation of the </p><p>Governorate\'s Public Health Office. </p><p> </p><p>10.  He said there is a continuing problem with the limited </p><p>supply of oxygen and raised the possibility of making </p><p>repairs to the local oxygen bottling plant to produce enough </p><p>containers to supply the area\'s hospitals\' needs.  (Note: </p><p>The DART, the Health Director, Civil Affairs Medical Liaison </p><p>officers, and IMC later met with the plant director and a </p><p>plan was put in place to find the necessary spare parts for </p><p>his equipment to enable his facility to meet the hospitals\' </p><p>needs.  It was estimated that the hospitals need an average </p><p>of 140 bottles of oxygen a day.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>EDUCATION </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  A contribution of USD 150,000 (source unknown) was </p><p>distributed to local headmasters for the purchase of school </p><p>supplies.  An election is also underway to determine the </p><p>university leadership.  There were lengthy discussions in </p><p>the city council meeting about final exams, and some </p><p>students have protested the cancellation of the school year. </p><p>The Coalition Civil Affairs Group Commander had received a </p><p>request from a group of 12th graders asking for a delay in </p><p>the final testing, coupled with an extended period of </p><p>assistance from teachers for study and test preparation. </p><p>The Commander supported this approach, calling on the school </p><p>administrators to use local television to advertise the </p><p>schedule for the exams\' preparation. </p><p> </p><p>12.  The Director of Education was confronted by one of the </p><p>Civil Affairs staff over reports that children from </p><p>internally displaced persons (IDPs) were not being allowed </p><p>to attend school.  The Director said many IDP families did </p><p>not have the proper documentation.  The Coalition Civil </p><p>Affairs Group Commander intervened, saying that paperwork </p><p>should not be an impediment to children attending school. </p><p>The Commander also noted that many children are still not </p><p>attending school.  He stressed that the city officials have </p><p>a personal responsibility to ensure that all children attend </p><p>school.  The Commander later met with the teachers and </p><p>encouraged them to honor their commitment to educate the </p><p>youths. (Back payments of teacher salaries were completed by </p><p>the end of May).  At the town council meeting, special </p><p>thanks were given to Mercy Corps for helping to get rural </p><p>schools operating again by providing USD 12,000 for the </p><p>rural school bus operations. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>VULNERABLE POPULATIONS </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  The designated Civil Affairs Officer for the social </p><p>services sector is encountering severe needs. There are </p><p>4,800 families on the social welfare register, including the </p><p>physically disabled, mentally handicapped, deaf, orphans, </p><p>and indigents, who previously received monthly payments (ID </p><p>15K to 22K per month) and other services (including propane </p><p>cooking gas), who are presently not receiving any assistance </p><p>and are in dire need.  Children from the orphanage are now </p><p>living, more or less unassisted, in the offices of the </p><p>Ministry of Social Services. </p><p> </p><p>14.  The DART met with the designated Civil Affairs officer </p><p>and Ministry representatives and outlined a plan of action. </p><p>The Civil Affairs officer will work with the representatives </p><p>to draft a budget of immediate program </p><p>needs.  After the meeting, the DART asked Mercy Corps </p><p>International (MCI) to meet with the officer and Ministry </p><p>representatives to see whether assistance might be provided </p><p>within the context of MCI\'s current cooperative agreement </p><p>with the DART. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>AL KUT ACCOUNTING </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>15.  During the Town Council and Sector meetings, municipal </p><p>department heads were repeatedly encouraged to complete </p><p>their budgets.  A Civil Affairs officer is overseeing the </p><p>process of assembling the departmental budgets.  Employees </p><p>of the treasury and accounting departments had taken home </p><p>some of the government\'s computers to protect the data </p><p>during the war and records of payments, funds and budgets </p><p>are being reassembled as these computers are being brought </p><p>back to the government offices.  The Civil Affairs officer </p><p>is now establishing a new database to reconcile the various </p><p>accounting systems. </p><p> </p><p>16.  This same officer is overseeing the inventory of all </p><p>public funds in the various agencies and banks.  The Health </p><p>Department and other public offices that receive small </p><p>payments from the public were asked to turn in surplus 250 </p><p>Iraqi dinar notes for 10,000 notes to help free up the </p><p>smaller denominations and to try to reverse the devaluation </p><p>of the 10,000 Iraqi dinar notes. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>WATER AND SANITATION </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>17.  The town council praised the city\'s sanitation workers </p><p>for their work.   Garbage trucks and other vehicles have </p><p>been collected from several ministries and are being used, </p><p>in multiple shifts, to start carting away garbage from the </p><p>city.  (Note.  Al Kut appeared to be one of the cleaner </p><p>cities in the south, with avenues and neighborhoods largely </p><p>devoid of trash.  Trashcans were also seen in various areas </p><p>around the city.  End Note.)  The town council also praised </p><p>the DART and MCI for planned repairs to the city\'s water </p><p>treatment plant, which is in need of spare parts and </p><p>equipment. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>CONCLUSION </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>18.  An important element in rehabilitating governorate </p><p>services in Wasit has been the leadership of the local </p><p>Coalition Civil Affairs Group Commander.  In the town </p><p>council and sectoral meetings, he regularly exhorted </p><p>departmental heads to get out of their offices and talk to </p><p>people to find out what they think of the government\'s </p><p>services.  He has taken several early morning walks around </p><p>the city to observe how offices are operating and to ask </p><p>people what kind of job the government is doing.  He </p><p>provided ready praise for successes by Iraqi department </p><p>directors and their staffs, and encouraged creative thinking </p><p>where problems were encountered. </p><p> </p><p>19.  The Commander\'s style of management appears to be </p><p>entirely new to most, if not all, of the Iraqis attending </p><p>the town council. Some appeared mystified; others were </p><p>confused.  The enthusiasm of many others, however, was </p><p>clear.  The Coalition Civil Affairs Group was ending its </p><p>period of responsibility in Al Kut in late May.  Another </p><p>Civil Affairs team is phasing in as the current team </p><p>departs.  The new Civil Affairs team will have large shoes </p><p>to fill and will need to show, through a steady turnover of </p><p>management responsibility to the local Iraqi government, </p><p>that the Coalition is committed to allowing Iraqis to govern </p><p>themselves in a newly free and transparent system. </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
