O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EPET, PGOV, EINV, ETRD, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: Zimbabwe\'s Fuel Hikes: Why No Leadership? </p><p> </p><p>Ref: Harare 779 </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary:  A week after raising fuel prices 3- </p><p>fold, President Mugabe has offered no rationale or </p><p>counsel to a shell-shocked populace.  The aging Marxist </p><p>seems unable to verbalize the case for economic </p><p>orthodoxy. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Each day, this economy becomes more surreal.  Many </p><p>locals now pay more for commuting than they earn.  They </p><p>are understandably irate, a sentiment that labor groups </p><p>have tried to channel into this week\'s mass action (ref). </p><p>The man-on-the-street cannot fathom how the Government </p><p>can now triple the fuel price - after doubling it in </p><p>January. </p><p> </p><p>Underproducing, Not Overpaying </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>3. (U) Though unspoken, the case for fuel hikes is </p><p>straight-forward.  Zimbabweans can no longer afford </p><p>imports like petroleum.  But they are not overpaying for </p><p>fuel; they are underproducing to be able to purchase what </p><p>they used to in the global marketplace. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) This is a policy-induced state.  Through fast- </p><p>track land reform, the GOZ has decimated commercial </p><p>agriculture, the traditional source of most export </p><p>revenue.  Through other export-unfriendly policies - </p><p>taxing, at one point, over 90 percent of export revenue - </p><p>the GOZ has similarly crippled mining and manufacturing </p><p>exports.  (Bad governance also deprives Zimbabwe\'s highly </p><p>developed textile sector of African Growth and </p><p>Opportunity Act benefits.)  Through retail price controls </p><p>- often well below production costs - the GOZ pushed non- </p><p>exporters to the brink. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>5. (SBU) The GOZ does not want to blame low productivity </p><p>for high transport costs, lest Zimbabweans question the </p><p>policies that caused their poverty.  Furthermore, the GOZ </p><p>is ideologically uneasy defending the partial restoration </p><p>of macroeconomic sensibility.  So it offers no official </p><p>defense of a policy shift that has thrust most </p><p>Zimbabweans into confusion and despair.  The GOZ\'s </p><p>strategy of silently raising fuel prices in successive </p><p>increments has not lessened the political fall-out - </p><p>compounded by its failure to coordinate increases in fuel </p><p>prices with increases in bus fares or wages. At a time </p><p>when people yearn for a roadmap, there is no leadership. </p><p>President Mugabe\'s Independence Day address and </p><p>subsequent interview instead claimed that things are a </p><p>bit tough now but will soon improve. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Opposition and labor leaders are fanning this </p><p>popular wrath.  That\'s politics.  Yet they realize the </p><p>nearly-broke GOZ has little choice but to cut its </p><p>preposterous fuel subsidy.  As governing party, the </p><p>Movement for Democratic Change would no doubt act the </p><p>same (though perhaps softening the blow through better </p><p>coordination with labor and more international support). </p><p>To fully eliminate the GOZ subsidy - a luxury the </p><p>Government can ill afford with minimal foreign exchange </p><p>cover - fuel will have to become even more expensive. </p><p> </p><p>Sullivan </p><p></p></div>
