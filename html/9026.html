Johnson per 1.5 (b) and (d) a </p><p>nd 1.6. </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary.  To outside observers, Former Yugoslav </p><p>President Zoran Lilic\'s testimony against Slobodan Milosevic </p><p>before the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former </p><p>Yugoslavia (ICTY) last week looked like a mixed bag.  Lilic </p><p>gave a detailed accounting of Milosevic\'s role in </p><p>decision-making in Belgrade and provided strong evidence for </p><p>Milosevic\'s responsibility for aspects of the conflict in </p><p>Kosovo.  However, Lilic gave direct evidence against the </p><p>Prosecution\'s claim that Milosevic bears responsibility for </p><p>the July 1995 massacres at Srebrenica.  Chief Prosecutor </p><p>Carla Del Ponte told embassy legal officers that the </p><p>prosecution was not surprised by the testimony and that it </p><p>was, apart from Srebrenica, "good" on all counts.  A senior </p><p>trial attorney in the case, however, gave a much more </p><p>downbeat assessment of Lilic\'s performance, revealing that </p><p>there was "fierce debate" within the OTP about whether, in </p><p>light of his testimony on Srebrenica and the Sarajevo siege, </p><p>he should be called by the prosecution at all. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Lilic testified before the ICTY after the Government </p><p>of Serbia and Montenegro (SAM) granted him a release from his </p><p>responsibility to maintain state secrets.  The testimony, at </p><p>SAM\'s insistence, was limited in scope and two government </p><p>representatives were present during the proceedings.  The </p><p>representatives also made it clear that they objected to any </p><p>document dated between 1993 and 1997 being discussed in </p><p>public session.  Most of the three days of testimony (direct </p><p>and cross-examination), however, were held in open session. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) During cross-examination, Milosevic referred to the </p><p>United Nations guarantee to respect the territorial integrity </p><p>and sovereignty of Yugoslavia and asked Lilic if their </p><p>resistance pushed former President Clinton back to the United </p><p>Nations, since NATO was unable to "set foot in Yugoslavia." </p><p>Judge May interrupted and stated that the witness "cannot </p><p>give evidence for Mr. Clinton."  Milosevic responded that he </p><p>hoped when the appropriate time comes, Judge May will issue </p><p>an order for Mr. Clinton to testify. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p>LILIC UNDERMINES PROSECUTION CASE FOR CRIMES IN BOSNIA </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Lilic testified on direct that he was certain that </p><p>Milosevic had not ordered the massacre, stating, "I know that </p><p>he was personally very upset and angry; I think that he was </p><p>very sincere in his behavior and conduct."  Lilic also </p><p>claimed that there was no way that the Yugoslav Army (VJ) was </p><p>involved in the massacre.  Lilic attempted to say more, but </p><p>the Prosecution directed him to another topic.  On </p><p>cross-examination, Milosevic noted that Lilic had mentioned </p><p>Srebrenica several times during his testimony the previous </p><p>day, but that lead Milosevic prosecutor Nice had kept </p><p>interrupting him.  Judge May defended Nice\'s objections </p><p>saying that he was correct to object to Lilic\'s opinions of </p><p>Milosevic\'s involvement in Srebrenica.  Milosevic argued that </p><p>Lilic had detailed knowledge of the events during that time </p><p>period.  Milosevic asked Lilic to comment on Serbian </p><p>involvement in Srebrenica, saying that it was a truly tragic </p><p>and dramatic event.  Lilic responded that no one from the </p><p>Yugoslav leadership could have issued an order or known about </p><p>the massacres.  His impression was that Milosevic was </p><p>"genuinely angry...shaken about it" when Lilic told him what </p><p>had happened.  Lilic testified that Milosevic said, "Those </p><p>crazy Serbs from Pale ...I cannot believe they did something </p><p>like this."  Milosevic asked what the RS\'s response was to </p><p>their inquiries into the massacre; Lilic responded that the </p><p>RS leadership said they knew nothing about it. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) Lilic did confirm that in the Fall of 1995, the </p><p>Yugoslav army set up a military training center to aid and </p><p>train Bosnian Serb troops.  He testified that General Perisic </p><p>helped set up the facility, but that Milosevic put </p><p>paramilitary leader Dragan Vasiljkovic in charge of running </p><p>it.  Lilic said that when he found out about the training </p><p>center, he was "amazed, and I ordered the camp to be </p><p>disbanded." </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Lilic\'s testimony relating to Srebrenica, and to </p><p>limited command-and-control over RS forces in Bosnia, did not </p><p>come as a surprise to the Prosecution, as Chief Prosecutor </p><p>Del Ponte told Embassy legal officers directly.  Del Ponte </p><p>gave an impression of being at ease with the testimony and, </p><p>in particular, the positive points drawn out (paras 7 - 14 </p><p>below).  Yet Dermot Groome (strictly protect), a senior trial </p><p>attorney (and former Manhattan assistant district attorney) </p><p>with responsibility for the Bosnia portion of the prosecution </p><p>of Milosevic, was much less sanguine about Lilic\'s </p><p>performance.  He told an Embassy legal officer that there was </p><p>a "fierce debate" within the prosecution team about whether </p><p>Lilic should be called to testify given what they knew of his </p><p>intended testimony.  When embassy legal officer noted that </p><p>Lilic\'s testimony went beyond opinion, eliciting Milosevic\'s </p><p>alleged "angry" and "shaken" responses to word of the </p><p>massacres, Groome expressed his worry that the trial chamber </p><p>would treat the testimony as direct evidence laying the </p><p>ground for reasonable doubt that Milosevic knew of the JNA\'s </p><p>activities in and around the Srebrenica enclave.  Moreover, </p><p>the testimony suggesting a lack of real control over the JNA </p><p>and Bosnian Serb officials could damage the prosecution\'s </p><p>case that Milosevic bears responsibility for the siege of </p><p>Sarajevo as well.  Groome, whose team is already scrambling </p><p>to unearth evidence linking Milosevic to Srebrenica, left an </p><p>impression of deep frustration that Lilic was allowed to </p><p>testify at all. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>TESTIMONY SUPPORTING THE PROSECUTION CASE </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) The Prosecution extracted from Lilic support for its </p><p>case in two principal areas -- his dominating decision-making </p><p>role in Belgrade between 1993 and 1997, and his </p><p>responsibility for atrocities in Kosovo. </p><p> </p><p>8. (U)  Milosevic as decision-maker: Lilic testified that </p><p>nothing important happened within official Belgrade without </p><p>Milosevic\'s knowledge.  He helped the Prosecution untangle </p><p>the web of relationships that tied the Milosevic circle </p><p>together, focusing, for example, on Jovica Stanisic, the Head </p><p>of the Serbian secret service within the Ministry of Interior </p><p>(MUP), a key ally for Milosevic and one of the most powerful </p><p>in the leadership at the time.  According to the </p><p>Constitution, Stanisic was to report to the Minister of </p><p>Interior, but in reality reported directly to Milosevic. </p><p>(NB: Stanisic, in ICTY custody, pled not guilty to OTP </p><p>charges on June 13.)  Lilic testified that the Socialist </p><p>Party of Serbia (SPS) and the Yugoslav United Left (JUL) </p><p>"were under the domination and authority of Milosevic." </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) He also testified that Milosevic had a "great deal of </p><p>influence" over Serbs in Bosnia and Croatia as well as the </p><p>Yugoslav Army VJ, but that "\'control\' was too strong of a </p><p>word."  Lilic testified that the VJ briefed Milosevic </p><p>regularly and that the General Staff of the VJ was the only </p><p>source of information they received.  He said that a group of </p><p>Generals remained close to Milosevic to advance their </p><p>careers.  Lilic alternated back and forth as to the Supreme </p><p>Defense Council\'s (SDC\'s) power and Milosevic\'s influence and </p><p>knowledge of all government matters.  Lilic further said that </p><p>Milosevic did not do anything outside his right prescribed by </p><p>the Constitution, but that he did play a dominant role in the </p><p>SDC.  When asked about Milosevic\'s relationship with Mladic, </p><p>Lilic confirmed other witness testimony that Mladic was very </p><p>unpredictable and unreliable, so the relationship between </p><p>Milosevic and Mladic varied.  The relationship deteriorated </p><p>over time, but once the Vance-Owen Plan failed, efforts were </p><p>made to improve their relationship. </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) Kosovo: Much of Lilic\'s testimony focused on a letter </p><p>sent from General Perisic to Milosevic on June 18, 1998.  The </p><p>letter detailed the problems in Kosovo, particularly the </p><p>illegal activity of the police.  The letter urged Milosevic </p><p>to order a state of emergency in Kosovo and reiterated that </p><p>without a state of emergency, the activities of the VJ there </p><p>were illegal and could be subject to reprisals from NATO and </p><p>the international community.  The letter further accused </p><p>Milosevic of going along with the illegal decisions of the </p><p>SDC and that Milosevic did not have authority to do so, </p><p>violating the principle of subordination and unity of </p><p>command.  In writing the letter, Lilic said that Perisic </p><p>wanted to draw attention to the seriousness of the problems </p><p>there and that any undermining of this would make things </p><p>worse.  He stated that Perisic was replaced four months after </p><p>the letter was written.  In response to Judge May\'s query as </p><p>to Milosevic\'s rationale for not responding, Lilic said that </p><p>Milosevic did not want to accept the seriousness of the </p><p>situation which was necessary to recognize and deal with the </p><p>problems.  He also noted that in a state of emergency, the </p><p>police would have been united and attached to the VJ. </p><p> </p><p>11. (U)  During the first day of cross-examination, Milosevic </p><p>was nonconfrontational and at times rather complimentary </p><p>towards Lilic, often referring to "we" when inquiring about </p><p>the positive steps the Yugoslav government took during the </p><p>conflicts.  Milosevic\'s actions and gestures appeared to be </p><p>the result of knowing that Lilic could help him on some </p><p>points.  Milosevic asked, "Did we make every effort for peace </p><p>in Bosnia and Croatia?"  Lilic responded, "Yes, we did.  And </p><p>the product of our efforts was the peace plans offered to the </p><p>world."  Lilic said that it was clear that Milosevic\'s </p><p>influence was dominant over foreign affairs.  He also said </p><p>that there would have been no Dayton without the persistence </p><p>and pressure from Milosevic.  He mentioned that Karadzic </p><p>obstinately refused all suggestions for a peace plan and that </p><p>no one trusted Karadzic.  Milosevic said, "This is what I </p><p>wanted to hear...no doubt the efforts were crucial."  Lilic </p><p>responded that "Yes, your efforts, your ability and </p><p>negotiations were crucial." </p><p> </p><p>12. (U)  However, during the second day of cross-examination, </p><p>the tone turned confrontational as Lilic testified to </p><p>Milosevic\'s accountability for Kosovo.  Lilic became angry at </p><p>one point and said that he wants his son to be proud to be a </p><p>Serb, but that "there are more Serbs in the ICTY prison than </p><p>there are in Kosovo now" and that they should have done more </p><p>to intervene in Kosovo.  Milosevic focused many of his </p><p>initial questions on the actions of the KLA and seeking </p><p>Lilic\'s confirmation that there was no discussion within the </p><p>government to expel Albanians from Kosovo.  Lilic testified </p><p>that Milosevic never gave an order to launch an attack on the </p><p>civilian population, and in fact they sought investigations </p><p>into such attacks.  With regard to the Perisic letter, </p><p>Milosevic asked Lilic if the letter was a "smokescreen" for </p><p>what was to have been done in Kosovo and that the necessary </p><p>actions could have been done without a state of emergency </p><p>being issued.  Lilic responded that he could hardly agree and </p><p>that it was Milosevic\'s opinion at the time that the army </p><p>could have responded to terrorist activities without a state </p><p>of emergency, but that the JNA could have done more if a </p><p>state of emergency had been implemented. </p><p> </p><p>13. (U) Milosevic inquired about a letter Lilic sent to </p><p>Milosevic that urged Milosevic to accept the latest United </p><p>Nations proposal given to Milosevic after a G8 meeting in </p><p>Berlin and championed by former German Chancellor Kohl to </p><p>accept a UN peacekeeping mission in Kosovo.  Lilic stressed </p><p>that all Milosevic had to do was make a public statement that </p><p>he would accept the proposal.  Milosevic then referred to a </p><p>letter which had handwritten notes from both Milosevic and </p><p>Lilic dated around May 5, 1998.  Milosevic was adamant that </p><p>he told Lilic to accept the proposal and said so in the note. </p><p> In response, Lilic referred to his handwritten note that </p><p>said "useful ambiguity."  Lilic insisted that Milosevic did </p><p>not authorize him to accept the proposal, but more </p><p>importantly, he made it clear to Milosevic that he would have </p><p>to publicly accept the proposal himself.  After Judge May </p><p>asked for clarification, Lilic said that he tried to reach </p><p>Milosevic for almost 2 weeks after the UN proposal was given </p><p>to discuss an end to the conflict.  After that, he sent the </p><p>letter to Milosevic outlining the problems in Kosovo, the UN </p><p>proposal, and urging Milosevic to act quickly. </p><p> </p><p>14. (U) Milosevic and Lilic subsequently entered into a </p><p>heated exchange where Milosevic said, "...that is why we </p><p>responded favorably (to the proposal)."   Lilic responded </p><p>with, "But...we did not favorably respond."  Milosevic </p><p>countered, "You said you would send the note to Chancellor </p><p>Kohl--my favorable response."  Lilic responded with, "Did you </p><p>really think I would fax Kohl your handwritten notes?"  Judge </p><p>May then intervened and asked what happened next.  Lilic </p><p>testified that after he noted that Milosevic instructed him </p><p>to be ambiguous in his response, Milosevic was scheduled to </p><p>appear on television to accept the proposal.  Since that did </p><p>not happen, Lilic did not transmit any response to Kohl.  At </p><p>that time, Milosevic told Lilic that he wanted to </p><p>re-establish contacts with the foreign interlocutors. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>THE HEALTH OF THE ACCUSED </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>15. (C) Throughout Lilic\'s testimony, on both direct and </p><p>cross-examination, Milosevic looked vigorous, alert and </p><p>healthy, buoyed especially by those aspects of Lilic\'s </p><p>testimony that seemed to be given in his favor.  Registry </p><p>legal adviser Christian Rohde (strictly protect), who sees </p><p>Milosevic regularly, confirmed to an embassy legal officer </p><p>that the accused\'s health has been improving markedly since </p><p>the middle of the spring.  He said that his blood pressure is </p><p>in control and that he seems to be less stressed than in </p><p>earlier portions of the trial.  With no hint of sarcasm, </p><p>Rohde attributed the upturn in Milosevic\'s health to the </p><p>absence of the accused\'s wife, Mira Markovic, from The Hague. </p><p> Early in the spring, many close observers of Milosevic saw </p><p>the dip in his health as a sign of his concern for his wife, </p><p>on the run from Belgrade prosecutors, and the impact of the </p><p>round-up of his Belgrade support network in the aftermath of </p><p>the assassination of Zoran Djindjic.  Rohde reports that </p><p>during her previous visits to The Hague, Markovic -- widely </p><p>known to be the organizing force behind Milosevic\'s defense </p><p>-- would leave her husband demonstrably stressed and anxious. </p><p> Her calls from "some former Soviet republic" do not seem to </p><p>impose the same kinds of rigors on him, Rohde reported. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>16. (C) The OTP took a gamble with Lilic\'s testimony and, in </p><p>retrospect, may have miscalculated.  While the testimony </p><p>confirmed many points the Prosecution is trying to prove, </p><p>such as direct links to individuals, the army and </p><p>paramilitaries, knowledge of events, and most importantly his </p><p>involvement in Kosovo, it was very damaging on Srebrenica. </p><p>Given that the OTP already had a relatively strong case for </p><p>Milosevic\'s responsibility for crimes committed in Kosovo, it </p><p>may have been prudent, as some OTP lawyers urged, to forgo </p><p>testimony that undercut the already shaky case on Srebrenica. </p><p> Limiting direct examination to non-Bosnia topics (with the </p><p>resulting limitation on the scope of the cross examination), </p><p>would at least have deprived Milosevic of an opportunity to </p><p>be cleared by Lilic for any role in Srebrenica.  Lilic\'s </p><p>value may be further diminished when he returns, "at a </p><p>convenient date," for one additional day for </p><p>cross-examination by Milosevic and the amicus curiae, as well </p><p>as a chance for re-direct and to authenticate the documents </p><p>recently turned over to the OTP. </p><p>SOBEL </p><p></p></div>
