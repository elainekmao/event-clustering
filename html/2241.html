(SBU)  SUMMARY.  A RECENT VISIT BY ARGENTINA\'S DEPUTY </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER UNDERSCORED A SHARED DETERMINATION TO </p><p>ADVANCE THE LIMITED ARGENTINA-VIETNAM BILATERAL </p><p>RELATIONSHIP.  THE VISIT FOCUSED ON ECONOMIC AND TRADE </p><p>ISSUES AND ALSO INCLUDED A FRAMEWORK AGREEMENT ON THE </p><p>PEACEFUL USE OF NUCLEAR ENERGY.  THOUGH INCREASINGLY REGULAR </p><p>EXCHANGES USUALLY AVOID RAISING CONTROVERSIAL ISSUES, THIS </p><p>VISIT DID INCLUDE AN AFFIRMATION OF SUPPORT FOR COUNTERING </p><p>INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) DURING A VISIT TO VIETNAM NOVEMBER 18-21, </p><p>ARGENTINA\'S DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER HORACIO CHIGHIZOLA </p><p>FOCUSED PRIMARILY ON PROMOTING BILATERAL TRADE, WHICH </p><p>AMOUNTED TO ONLY ABOUT USD 47 MILLION IN 2000.  HE WAS </p><p>ACCOMPANIED BY EIGHT BUSINESS LEADERS, REPRESENTING 12 </p><p>ARGENTINEAN COMPANIES.  DFM CHIGHIZOLA MET WITH HIS </p><p>COUNTERPART, VICE FOREIGN MINISTER NGUYEN DINH BIN, AND ALSO </p><p>CALLED ON FOREIGN MINISTER NGUYEN DY NIEN, TRADE MINISTER VU </p><p>KHOAN, AND MINISTER OF SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, AND ENVIRONMENT </p><p>CHU TUAN NHA, ACCORDING TO THE MFA AND PRESS REPORTS. </p><p>CHIGHIZOLA PARTICIPATED IN "SEVERAL BUSINESS ROUNDTABLE </p><p>DISCUSSIONS," ACCORDING TO ARGENTINEAN EMBOFF MARCELO </p><p>GILARDONI. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  03124  01 OF 02  300036Z </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>STEADILY IMPROVING BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  MFA AMERICAS DEPARTMENT SENIOR EXPERT LE THANH </p><p>TUNG NOTED THAT WHILE VIETNAM AND ARGENTINA HAD ESTABLISHED </p><p>DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS IN 1973, "UP TO THE EARLY 90S, WE HAD </p><p>ALMOST NO RELATIONSHIP."  SINCE 1993, HE ADDED, THE TWO </p><p>COUNTRIES HAVE SEEN A "STEADY IMPROVEMENT" IN THE BILATERAL </p><p>RELATIONSHIP, WITH A SERIES OF SENIOR LEVEL VISITS AND THE </p><p>ESTABLISHMENT OF RESIDENT EMBASSIES. (NOTE:  VIETNAM </p><p>REPRESENTATION IS LIMITED IN LATIN AMERICA TO CUBA, MEXICO, </p><p>BRAZIL, AND ARGENTINA.  END NOTE.)   FROM BUENOS AIRES, HE </p><p>CITED VISITS IN 1996 BY THE FOREIGN MINISTER, IN 1997 BY THE </p><p>PRESIDENT, AND IN 1998 BY THE MINISTER OF JUSTICE.  ON THE </p><p>GVN SIDE, TUNG NOTED VARIOUS MINISTERIAL LEVEL VISITS, </p><p>INCLUDING IN 2001 BY THE MFA\'S FIRST VICE MINISTER AS WELL </p><p>AS THE MINISTER OF CULTURE AND SPORTS.  IN 1999, DEPUTY </p><p>PRIME MINISTER CAM VISITED ARGENTINA IN HIS THEN-CONCURRENT </p><p>CAPACITY AS FOREIGN MINISTER. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  TUNG SAID THAT PREVIOUS VISITS HAD RESULTED IN </p><p>AGREEMENTS ON ANIMAL HUSBANDRY AND INVESTMENT PROTECTION. </p><p>HE NOTED THAT THE SECOND MEETING OF THE JOINT VIETNAMESE- </p><p>ARGENTINEAN GOVERNMENTAL COMMISSION FOR ECONOMIC COOPERATION </p><p>IS EXPECTED TO OCCUR IN BUENOS AIRES "PROBABLY NEXT MARCH OR </p><p>APRIL" AND THAT ITS PREPARATIONS WERE AMONG THE TOPICS </p><p>DISCUSSED BY DFM CHIGHIZOLA.  A SENIOR SRV TRADE MINISTRY </p><p>OFFICIAL AND "SEVERAL PROMINENT" VIETNAMESE BUSINESSPEOPLE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  03124  01 OF 02  300036Z </p><p>ARE EXPECTED TO ATTEND. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>MODEST TRADE VOLUME </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  ALTHOUGH THE BILATERAL TRADE VOLUME REMAINS </p><p>MODEST, TUNG HIGHLIGHTED ITS INCREASE FROM USD 11.5 MILLION </p><p>IN 1993 TO USD 47 MILLION IN 2000.  VIETNAM EXPORTS RICE, </p><p>RUBBER, FOOTWEAR, AND SOME HANDICRAFTS TO ARGENTINA, WHILE </p><p>IMPORTING BEEF, OLIVE OIL, WINE, AND FISH POWDER.  TUNG </p><p>ADMITTED THAT CURRENT TRADE "HAS NOT MET OUR EXPECTATIONS OR </p><p>POTENTIAL."  EMBOFF GILARDONI NOTED THAT THE PRIMARY FACTORS </p><p>LIMITING TRADE ARE THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE COUNTRIES, A </p><p>LACK OF FAMILIARITY WITH EACH OTHER\'S MARKET CONDITIONS, AND </p><p>THE "GRAVE FINANCIAL CRISIS" IN ARGENTINA.  BOTH OFFICIALS </p><p>STATED THAT THE NEED TO INCREASE TRADE WAS A FOCUS OF THE </p><p>DFM\'S MEETINGS.  ACCORDING TO GILARDONI, THERE ARE NO JOINT </p><p>VENTURES YET, BUT BOTH SIDES ARE "HOPEFUL" THAT PROGRESS IN </p><p>THIS AREA WILL OCCUR AFTER THE NEXT JOINT COMMISSION </p><p>MEETING. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>AGREEMENT ON NUCLEAR ENERGY </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  DURING THE DPM\'S VISIT, THE TWO SIDES SIGNED A </p><p>FRAMEWORK AGREEMENT ON THE PEACEFUL USE OF NUCLEAR ENERGY. </p><p>ACCORDING TO TUNG, THIS AGREEMENT "IS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE </p><p>NUCLEAR DEVELOPMENT REGULATIONS OF BOTH COUNTRIES."   HE </p><p>NOTED THAT BOTH COUNTRIES WILL EXCHANGE VISITS OF EXPERTS, </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 05        HANOI  03124  01 OF 02  300036Z </p><p>BUT DID NOT PROVIDE SPECIFICS AS TO WHAT POTENTIAL PROJECTS </p><p>MIGHT RESULT FROM THIS AGREEMENT, WHICH HE DESCRIBED AS </p><p>RATHER "GENERAL." </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>MUM ON POLITICAL ISSUES--EXCEPT TERRORISM </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU)  TUNG AND EMBOFF GILARDONI STATED SEPARATELY THAT </p><p>THIS AND PREVIOUS VISITS HAVE "FOCUSED ON ECONOMICS" AND </p><p>ONLY DISCUSSED POLITICAL ISSUES TO THE EXTENT THERE ARE </p><p>"MUTUAL INTERESTS."  BOTH OFFICIALS SAID THAT ISSUES SUCH AS </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS AND RELIGIOUS FREEDOM ARE NEVER ON THE AGENDA. </p><p>TUNG EMPHASIZED, HOWEVER, THAT THE ISSUE OF TERRORISM WAS </p><p>RAISED AND THAT BOTH SIDES "REAFFIRMED THEIR COMMITMENT TO </p><p>FIGHTING INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM."  TUNG ADDED THAT BOTH </p><p>SIDES AGREED THIS SHOULD BE DONE IN ACCORDANCE WITH </p><p>"INTERNATIONALLY ACCEPTED PRINCIPLES." </p><p>PORTER </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
