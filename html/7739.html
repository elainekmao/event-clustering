SUMMARY: Air Canada\'s recent filing for bankruptcy </p><p>protection follows efforts over the past several months to </p><p>restructure its operations and lower its costs in order to </p><p>remain competitive during a difficult time in the airline </p><p>industry.  However, a combination of its own business </p><p>decisions, the rise of low-cost competitors, and several </p><p>devastating events beyond its control helped bring the </p><p>airline to this point. The bankruptcy protection will </p><p>provide the airline time to develop a long-term strategy </p><p>that might allow it to compete in a changed market.  The </p><p>Canadian government has indicated a willingness to provide </p><p>loan guarantees to Air Canada, but there are currently no </p><p>plans for a cash bailout. END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>2. On April 1, 2003 Air Canada sought protection under the </p><p>Companies\' Creditors Arrangement Act (CCAA), Canada\'s </p><p>equivalent to Chapter 11.  Even before the bankruptcy </p><p>filing, Air Canada had declared a Force Majeur, citing the </p><p>war in Iraq, in order to find relief from some contractual </p><p>obligations and to justify the impending layoffs of 3,600 </p><p>workers, about 10 percent of its total workforce.  The Force </p><p>Majeur declaration prompted a swift negative reaction from </p><p>many of the airline\'s unions, which had already agreed to </p><p>work with the company to save C$650 million annually in </p><p>labor costs. </p><p> </p><p>3. During 2002 Air Canada lost C$428 million, most of that </p><p>amount in the final quarter.  Since 1999, Air Canada has </p><p>lost C$1.7 billion and is currently losing about C$3 million </p><p>per day.  It has over C$13 billion of accumulated debt, </p><p>approximately C$8 billion of which resulted from the 1999 </p><p>acquisition of Canadian Airlines (then its main rival), </p><p>which was purchased primarily for its profitable Asian </p><p>routes.  Air Canada\'s pension liability is also C$1.3 </p><p>billion.  It is the third major North American airline to </p><p>seek protection from its creditors in the past 18 months, </p><p>after United Airlines and USAIR. </p><p> </p><p>4. As recently as 2000, Air Canada carried about 80 percent </p><p>of Canada\'s domestic passenger traffic.  The company\'s </p><p>overwhelmingly dominant market share has led rivals to </p><p>accuse it of predatory pricing.  Predatory or not, the </p><p>airline\'s strategies have evidently not been successful: in </p><p>the last 12 months, Air Canada has lost 12 percent of its </p><p>domestic market share to its low-cost competitors, </p><p>principally Calgary-based WestJet.  Cameron Doerksen, </p><p>aerospace analyst for Dlouhy Merchant Group, a Montreal- </p><p>based investment bank, told post "they [Air Canada] simply </p><p>cannot compete in the low-cost carrier market with a big </p><p>airline budget," a view echoed by Michel LeBlanc, CEO of </p><p>Montreal-based low-cost carrier Jetsgo. </p><p> </p><p>5. Over the past two years, Air Canada has tried to compete </p><p>with its low-cost rivals by dividing its business into the </p><p>main Air Canada brand and four new subsidiaries and brand </p><p>names: Zip, Tango, Jazz and Jetz (REFTEL D).  Most operate </p><p>on a lower wage/cost structure, but growth potential is </p><p>limited by union contracts to a relatively small scale of </p><p>operation, lest they cannibalize the main Air Canada </p><p>operations and their higher-wage jobs.  Doerksen asserts </p><p>that despite these efforts to compete in the low-cost </p><p>market, where it might be difficult for a traditionally high- </p><p>cost carrier ever to compete effectively, Air Canada will </p><p>need to focus on its primary strength: long-haul </p><p>international business travel. </p><p> </p><p>6. While Air Canada prepares a restructuring plan, expected </p><p>in the middle of May, financial services company GE Capital </p><p>has extended a C$1 billion line of credit to the airline. </p><p>Air Canada CEO Robert Milton has also called on the Canadian </p><p>government to provide loan guarantees during the </p><p>restructuring, claiming it is impossible for Air Canada to </p><p>compete with U.S.-based carriers that received a large </p><p>financial package from the U.S. government following the </p><p>terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.  Transport Minister </p><p>David Collenette has previously indicated a willingness to </p><p>consider loan guarantees, but no grants.  Meanwhile, the </p><p>Parliamentary Committee on Airlines recently called for the </p><p>federal government to assist all Canadian airlines by </p><p>suspending airport rents and security fee collections for </p><p>two years.  Both LeBlanc of Jetsgo and Clive Bedoe, CEO of </p><p>WestJet, agree that all domestic airlines are vulnerable to </p><p>current market conditions and believe that a national </p><p>bailout should apply to all airlines, not just Air Canada. </p><p> </p><p>7. Air Canada returned to Ontario Superior court on April </p><p>22.  In a hearing attended by attorneys from its labor </p><p>unions and over 100 creditors seeking payment, Air Canada </p><p>requested an extension of its restructuring window to June </p><p>30, permission to delay its annual meeting until a </p><p>restructuring plan is complete, and approval to renegotiate </p><p>some of its labor agreements.  Air Canada had tentatively </p><p>been permitted to suspend some of its contractual </p><p>obligations when it made its CCAA filing on April 1.  Unlike </p><p>U.S. Chapter 11, the CCAA has not historically permitted </p><p>companies to void collective bargaining agreements.  On </p><p>April 22, Ontario Justice James Farley rescinded some of the </p><p>protections given Air Canada on April 1, but encouraged the </p><p>airline and its unions to continue negotiations that would </p><p>allow Air Canada to produce a viable restructuring plan. </p><p>Both sides tried to interpret this outcome as a victory; the </p><p>unions because Justice Farley denied Air Canada\'s request to </p><p>bypass its agreements, and Air Canada because it may have </p><p>obtained more flexibility in dealing with its unions than </p><p>many companies have in the past.  Air Canada\'s decision to </p><p>make its CCAA filing in Ontario is believed by some analysts </p><p>to have been influenced by a recent Quebec court ruling in </p><p>the case of Quebec mining company Jeffrey Mine, Inc., that </p><p>collective agreements are protected during a restructuring </p><p>period. </p><p> </p><p>8. In order to raise cash, Air Canada has in recent months </p><p>attempted to sell some of its key holdings.  In February </p><p>2003, it sold a 35 percent stake in Aeroplan, the airline\'s </p><p>frequent flyer program, for C$245 million, and recently </p><p>renegotiated an agreement with the Canadian International </p><p>Bank of Commerce (CIBC) that will allow it to generate cash </p><p>by selling frequent-flyer miles to retailers and insurance </p><p>companies.  The Jazz subsidiary, a pan-Canadian domestic </p><p>carrier, has been put up for sale, as has Air Canada </p><p>Technical Services (ACTS).  ACTS may have a potential buyer </p><p>in La Federation des travailleurs du Quebec (FTQ), which has </p><p>2,500 members working at ACTS in Quebec.  Andre Viau, </p><p>portfolio manager for aerospace with the FTQ pension fund </p><p>management group, told post "the deal is not yet clear. </p><p>While we have a double interest in saving jobs and making </p><p>some money, we might be looking to take on a small stake." </p><p>Selling Jazz may prove more difficult; unlike some of the </p><p>new subsidiaries, Jazz is burdened with older equipment and </p><p>high labor costs, making it a relatively unattractive </p><p>property in a slow airline market.  In addition, federal law </p><p>restricting foreign ownership of Canadian airlines to 25 </p><p>percent limits the pool of potential buyers.  CEO Milton and </p><p>other industry insiders have called on Transport Minister </p><p>Collenette to amend this law, but he has stated that it </p><p>would remain in place until the U.S. makes the same change. </p><p> </p><p>9. Air Canada\'s bankruptcy filing has caused short-term </p><p>problems for others in the Canadian aviation system. </p><p>NavCanada, the Crown Corporation that operates the country\'s </p><p>air-traffic control system, is in financial jeopardy because </p><p>Air Canada - its best customer - has failed to make its C$4 </p><p>million weekly payment since the CCAA filing.  Air Canada </p><p>owes Aroports de Montreal C$11.5 million for unpaid rents </p><p>and services rendered, and the Greater Toronto Airport </p><p>Authority has seen its bond ratings lowered by Standard and </p><p>Poor\'s in the wake of the Air Canada bankruptcy filing. </p><p>Justice Farley has denied creditors\' statutory right to </p><p>seize Air Canada\'s assets until after a restructuring plan </p><p>is submitted. </p><p> </p><p>10. Air Canada is continuing regular operations during its </p><p>restructuring, and the impact on travelers should be </p><p>minimal.  However, in addition to lingering effects of the </p><p>September 11 attacks and the war in Iraq, the recent </p><p>outbreak of SARS is affecting Air Canada especially hard; </p><p>their most profitable international routes are to Asia, </p><p>while Toronto serves as its primary Canadian hub.  Even </p><p>before the CDC and the World Health Organization issued </p><p>travel advisories for Toronto, many people had been avoiding </p><p>Toronto\'s Pearson Airport.  Taken together, Air Canada is </p><p>experiencing a drop in passenger traffic at a time it can </p><p>little afford it.  Air Canada several days ago mentioned </p><p>that it might look to route some of its international </p><p>flights to other airports - in particular Halifax and </p><p>Montreal - but no such plan is yet in place. </p><p> </p><p>11. In the longer run, prospects may be more encouraging for </p><p>both Air Canada and others.  Typically, an airline of Air </p><p>Canada\'s size will emerge from bankruptcy protection between </p><p>20-30 percent smaller, according to Doerkson.  Viau believes </p><p>the new Air Canada will be smaller but stronger. "With a </p><p>smaller airline, they [Air Canada] will probably look to </p><p>increase their outsourcing contracts, which will be good for </p><p>the aerospace sector in Montreal," he told post.  Milton </p><p>recently announced that a restructured Air Canada will have </p><p>to shape itself along the lines of the new North American </p><p>airline business model, with smaller planes and lower </p><p>operating costs.  Air Canada has recently joined a </p><p>consortium to purchase regional jets from Bombardier; Air </p><p>Canada would initially acquire 25 of these jets to serve </p><p>short-haul, moneymaking routes.  Air Canada recently named </p><p>former Bombardier CEO Robert Brown to its board, which </p><p>suggests that Bombardier is likely to remain Air Canada\'s </p><p>principal aircraft supplier in this market, as opposed to </p><p>its primary competitor, Brazil\'s Embraer. </p><p> </p><p>12. Comment: Air Canada\'s current predicament appears to be </p><p>the result of both its own decisions in recent years and a </p><p>number of unfortunate circumstances beyond the company\'s </p><p>control.  Like many airlines, Air Canada has sought to lower </p><p>its costs, either through changing union contracts or </p><p>establishing new business models.  These measures have and </p><p>will likely continue to generate resistance but are probably </p><p>essential to Air Canada\'s long-term viability. End Comment. </p><p>KANTER </p><p></p></div>
