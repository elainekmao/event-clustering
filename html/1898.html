<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 002508 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF, AF/S, AND AF/EPS </p><p> </p><p>USAID FOR AA/AFR, BHR/FFP, AFR/SA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAID, PREL, PREL, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT:  HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE: PRELIMINARY </p><p>COMMENTS/ISSUES CONCERNING WORLD VISION PROPOSAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.   SUMMARY.  POST UNDERSTANDS URGENCY OF HUMANITARIAN </p><p>  ASSISTANCE (HA); HOWEVER, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE WV </p><p>  PROPOSAL AS CURRENTLY PRESENTED TO BE A SUFFICIENT USG </p><p>  RESPONSE TO THE CRISIS.  WE HAVE A NUMBER OF CONCERNS </p><p>  ELABORATED BELOW AND REQUEST ADVICE ON THE LIKELY LEVEL OF </p><p>  RESOURCE AVAILABILITY FROM THE USG. </p><p> </p><p>2.   THIS MESSAGE PROVIDES PRELIMINARY COMMENTS ON SECOND </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  02508  01 OF 02  241030Z </p><p>  DRAFT OF WORLD VISION (WV) PROPOSAL.  WE UNDERSTAND THAT </p><p>  THERE IS A THIRD VERSION THAT WE HAVE NOT SEEN AND THAT WV </p><p>  EXPECTS TO SHORTLY SUBMIT A FOURTH VERSION.  POST HAS NOT </p><p>  CONDUCTED A FULL REVIEW OF THE PROPOSAL AND THUS THIS </p><p>  MESSAGE SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS INFORMAL AND PRELIMINARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  POST HAS SEVERAL COMMENTS AND CONCERNS, AND THESE </p><p>INCLUDE: </p><p> </p><p>--WE CONCUR IN THE PROPOSED GEOGRAPHIC FOCUS IN MIDLANDS AND </p><p>MATEBELELAND NORTH THAT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT POLITICAL AND </p><p>ETHNIC BALANCE. </p><p> </p><p>--ALL DONORS HERE CONSIDER THE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS IN </p><p>ZIMBABWE A COMPLEX MAN-MADE DISASTER CAUSED PARTIALLY BY </p><p>VIOLENCE AND DISRUPTIONS IN THE COMMERCIAL FARMING SECTOR </p><p>RESULTING IN THE DISPLACEMENT OF FARM WORKERS AND MOVEMENT </p><p>OF COMMUNAL FARMERS TO RESETTLEMENT AREAS; INAPPROPRIATE GOZ </p><p>BUDGET PRIORITIES; AND POOR MACRO-ECONOMIC POLICIES SUCH AS </p><p>RECENT REGRESSION ON LIBERALIZING GRAIN MARKETS.  THE IMPACT </p><p>OF CYCLONE ELINE, AND INADEQUATE GOZ RESPONSES TO THIS </p><p>PHENOMENON, AND THE PERENNIAL DROUGHT IN THE TARGET REGIONS </p><p>HAVE FURTHER AGGRAVATED THE SITUATION.  THE WV PROPOSAL </p><p>FACTORS IN THE IMPACT OF THE DROUGHT BUT ONLY ACKNOWLEDGES </p><p>(P. 4) THAT OPPORTUNITIES FOR INCOME GENERATION AS OPPOSED </p><p>TO SUPPLEMENTAL FOOD DISTRIBUTION ARE "DWINDLING" DUE TO THE </p><p>GENERAL ECONOMIC DECLINE. </p><p> </p><p>--A COMPLEX EMERGENCY REQUIRES RESPONSES IN ADDITION TO </p><p>FOOD.  IN THIS RESPECT, THE PROPOSAL IS INADEQUATE.  WHILE </p><p>THERE ARE STATEMENTS REGARDING WV "PLANS" TO MOVE THE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02508  01 OF 02  241030Z </p><p>ACTIVITY FROM GENERAL DISTRIBUTION OF FOOD TO "FOOD ASSISTED </p><p>ACTIVITIES" IN YEARS TWO AND THREE (IF INDEED THE PROGRAM </p><p>EXTENDS THAT LONG), THERE ARE NO DETAILS ABOUT WHAT WV PLANS </p><p>TO DO IN THE WAY OF ALTERNATIVE DELIVERY MECHANISMS.  WE ARE </p><p>CONCERNED THAT ALTERNATIVES WILL NOT BE DEVELOPED BEFORE THE </p><p>DIRECT FEEDING PROGRAM STARTS AND A CYCLE OF FOOD </p><p>DISTRIBUTION WILL RESULT, ESPECIALLY IF GOZ LAND POLICY </p><p>PROVOKES EVEN MORE SERIOUS FOOD SHORTAGES IN FOLLOWING </p><p>YEARS.  BECAUSE THE US HAS TAKEN THE LEAD IN CALLING FOR A </p><p>DIFFERENT RESPONSE TO FOOD CRISES (OTHER THAN FREE FEEDING), </p><p>WE COULD OPEN OURSELVES TO CRITICISM.  IN ADDITION, IT WOULD </p><p>BE SHORTSIGHTED TO APPROVE AN ACTIVITY THAT ONLY ADDRESSES </p><p>FOOD FOR THE MOST NEEDY WITHOUT ADDRESSING THE NEED FOR </p><p>INCOME GENERATION, WHICH CANNOT BE DONE UNTIL ALTERNATIVE </p><p>ACTIVITIES ARE IDENTIFIED.  AT A MINIMUM, WE WOULD LIKE TO </p><p>SEE SOME ALTERNATIVE MECHANISMS, AND A TIME LINE TO INDICATE </p><p>WHEN EXPERIMENTATION WITH THESE WILL BE INITIATED. </p><p> </p><p>--THE RELIANCE ON ONLY DIRECT DISTRIBUTION TO THE MOST NEEDY </p><p>ALSO VIOLATES THE PRINCIPLES THAT USAID HARARE DEVELOPED AND </p><p>PRESENTED TO STATE AND USAID WASHINGTON IN EARLY JULY. </p><p>GIVEN THE POLITICAL SITUATION, DIRECT DISTRIBUTION IS THE </p><p>APPROACH MOST VULNERABLE TO POLITICAL INTERFERENCE.  WHILE </p><p>WE RECOGNIZE THAT IT MAY BE IMPOSSIBLE TO PREVENT </p><p>POLITICIZATION OF THE RESOURCE, GIVEN A LONG HISTORY OF </p><p>PATRONAGE AND THE USE OF STATE RESOURCES TO BROADEN </p><p>POLITICAL SUPPORT, WE BELIEVE THAT USING FOOD FOR WORK WILL </p><p>GIVE BENEFICIARIES A SENSE THAT THEY HAVE EARNED THE </p><p>RESOURCE. </p><p> </p><p>--DESIGN PRINCIPLES ALSO CALLED FOR MONITORING BY REPUTABLE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02508  01 OF 02  241030Z </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS TO DETERMINE NEUTRALITY OF DISTRIBUTION AND </p><p>WHETHER THERE IS POLITICAL INTERFERENCE.  THE PROPOSAL DOES </p><p>NOT ADDRESS THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. </p><p> </p><p>--THE PROPOSAL ALSO DOES NOT ADDRESS THE PRINCIPLE OF </p><p>RELYING ON COMMERCIAL MECHANISMS AND WORKING WITH THE </p><p>PRIVATE SECTOR TO THE GREATEST EXTENT POSSIBLE.  WHILE THE </p><p>STATEMENTS IN THE PROPOSAL INDICATE A WILLINGNESS TO EXAMINE </p><p>DISTRIBUTION ALTERNATIVES, POST FEARS THAT ONCE A DIRECT </p><p>DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM COMMENCES, IT WILL BE VERY DIFFICULT, </p><p>TO MOVE TO OTHER DISTRIBUTION MECHANISMS.  EXPERIENCE WITH </p><p>FEEDING PROGRAMS ELSEWHERE SUPPORTS THIS REASONING. </p><p> </p><p>-- THERE IS NO MENTION IN THE PROPOSAL OF THE ROLE OF THE </p><p>COMMUNITIES IN IDENTIFYING BENEFICIARIES AND USE OF THE </p><p>RESOURCES. THE PROPOSAL DOES NOT DESCRIBE HOW WV WILL </p><p>INTERACT WITH GOVERNMENT OR DESCRIBE THE ROLE OF THE GOZ IN </p><p>SELECTING BENEFICIARIES. </p><p> </p><p>--THE PROPOSAL DOES NOT ELABORATE ON PAST WV EXPERIENCE WITH </p><p>DIRECT DISTRIBUTION IN ZIMBABWE OR ELSEWHERE.  IT DOES NOT </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ0699 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  02508  02 OF 02  241031Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DODE-00  SRPP-00 </p><p>      DS-00    UTED-00  VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   LAB-01   VCE-00 </p><p>      DCP-01   NSAE-00  IRM-00   TEST-00  DSCC-00  DRL-02   NFAT-00 </p><p>      SAS-00     /004W </p><p>                  ------------------15F984  241031Z /38 </p><p>P 241021Z AUG 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 9546 </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 002508 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF, AF/S, AND AF/EPS </p><p> </p><p>USAID FOR AA/AFR, BHR/FFP, AFR/SA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS:  EAID, PREL, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT:  HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE: PRELIMINARY </p><p>COMMENTS/ISSUES CONCERNING WORLD VISION PROPOSAL </p><p> </p><p>DESCRIBE HOW OR BY WHOM FOOD WILL BE DISTRIBUTED. </p><p> </p><p>--THE PROPOSAL IS MUTE ON THE ISSUE OF THE SECURITY ISSUES </p><p>AND HOW IT WILL ADDRESS THEM.  A KEY ASSUMPTION THAT </p><p>"SECURITY REMAINS GOOD IN THE PROPOSED PROGRAM AREA" IS </p><p>QUESTIONABLE.  WE DO NOT THINK THAT THE SITUATION ON THE </p><p>GROUND IS THAT CLEAR. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  02508  02 OF 02  241031Z </p><p>--WHILE THE PROPOSAL IDENTIFIES OTHER NGOS, INCLUDING </p><p>INDIGENOUS ONES, IN THE PROGRAM AREA, IT DOES NOT DESCRIBE </p><p>THEIR INVOLVEMENT OR COLLABORATION.  USAID HAS CONSULTED </p><p>WITH A WIDE RANGE OF NGOS IN THE PROPOSED PROGRAM AREA AND </p><p>FOUND A HIGH DEGREE OF HISTORICAL COLLABORATION AND A </p><p>WILLINGNESS TO WORK TOGETHER AND SHARE RESOURCES.  THE WV </p><p>PROPOSAL MAKES NO MENTION OF HOW IT WILL WORK WITH OTHERS. </p><p>MEANWHILE POST HAS INDICATED TO OTHER NGOS THAT WHILE WE </p><p>WOULD WORK THROUGH A US ORGANIZATION, WE WOULD EXPECT </p><p>COLLABORATION INCLUDING SHARED RESOURCES THAT WOULD ALLOW </p><p>OTHER NGOS TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE IN COMMUNITIES WHERE WV IS </p><p>NOT PRESENT. </p><p> </p><p>--THE PROGRAM MONITORING INDICATORS INCLUDE ONLY ONE "PEOPLE </p><p>LEVEL" INDICATOR - NUMBER OF TARGETED BENEFICIARIES.  ALL </p><p>OTHER INDICATORS FOCUS ON TRAINING OF WV STAFF, </p><p>COMPUTERIZATION OF THE DISTRIBUTION TRACKING SYSTEM, ETC. </p><p>COMMODITY REPORTS WOULD BE SUBMITTED MONTHLY/QUARTERLY, </p><p>ACCORDING TO THE PROPOSAL, BUT OTHER INDICATORS - STAFF </p><p>TRAINING, SUCCESS OF THE TRACKING SYSTEM -- WOULD ONLY BE AT </p><p>THE PROJECT\'S END. </p><p> </p><p>--ECONOMIC INDICATORS CITED IN SECTION B (PAGE 4) ARE </p><p>UNDERSTATED. </p><p> </p><p>--BELLMON ANALYSIS APPEARS INADEQUATE.  WHILE WE ACKNOWLEDGE </p><p>THAT THE WV PROPOSAL WOULD HAVE MINIMAL MARKET IMPACT, THERE </p><p>IS NO ANALYSIS OF TOTAL NEEDS, MARKET ABILITY TO RESPOND TO </p><p>THE IMPACT OF THE PROPOSED FOOD AID OR MIX OF COMMODITIES. </p><p> </p><p>3.   LIKE WASHINGTON, POST IS SEIZED WITH THE URGENCY OF </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02508  02 OF 02  241031Z </p><p>  THIS MATTER.  NOTWITHSTANDING, GIVEN THE LIKELIHOOD THAT </p><p>  THIS MAY BE THE PRIMARY USG RESPONSE TO THE HUMANITARIAN </p><p>  CRISIS, IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT WE WORK WITH WV TO BE SURE THE </p><p>  PROPOSAL IS VIABLE AND APPROPRIATE.  ALTERNATIVELY, WE COULD </p><p>  ENGAGE ANOTHER USPVO AUTHORIZED AS A COOPERATING SPONSOR FOR </p><p>  PL 480, OR WE SHOULD CONSIDER NOW WHAT WOULD BE NEEDED TO </p><p>  MONETIZE A PORTION OF THE FOOD AND ALLOW THE PRIVATE SECTOR </p><p>  TO IMPORT AND DISTRIBUTE, TO AVOID MARKET DISTORTIONS IN ANY </p><p>  FUTURE PROGRAM.  WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS IS NOT FEASIBLE </p><p>  BEFORE THE END OF THIS FISCAL YEAR.  WE NOTE BASED ON </p><p>  INFORMATION FROM USAID/BHR EXPERTS THAT WE CAN CALL FORWARD </p><p>  THE FOOD SHIPMENT WITHOUT AWARDING THE GRANT TO WV AT THIS </p><p>  TIME.  IF ADDITIONAL RESOURCES ARE LIKELY TO BE MADE </p><p>  AVAILABLE, WE COULD CONSIDER THE WV PROPOSAL AS ONE ELEMENT </p><p>  OF OUR RESPONSE.  HOWEVER, IT IS OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT </p><p>  RESOURCES ARE EXTREMELY LIMITED AND THAT THE PACKAGE </p><p>  PROPOSED BY WV IS LIKELY TO BE THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF RESOURCES </p><p>  USG CAN MAKE AVAILABLE. </p><p> </p><p>4.   ACTION REQUEST:  USAID/BHR IS REQUESTED TO ADVISE </p><p>  WHETHER THE QUANTITIES (12,000 MT) AND MIX OF COMMODITIES IS </p><p>  LIKELY TO BE AVAILABLE AND WHETHER THE REQUEST FOR 202E </p><p>  FUNDING IS REASONABLE GIVEN RESOURCE AVAILABILITY.  ARE </p><p>  INCREMENTAL RESOURCES BEYOND THOSE PROPOSED BY WV AVAILABLE </p><p>  FOR OTHER HA PROGRAMS?  INCREASINGLY RELIABLE ESTIMATES ARE </p><p>  BEGINNING TO COALESCE AROUND THE 300,000 - 400,000 MT LEVEL </p><p>  FOR THE ANTICIPATED SHORTFALL, WHICH MIGHT INCLUDE A SET </p><p>  ASIDE PORTION FOR THE STRATEGIC GRAIN RESERVE FOR 2002. </p><p> </p><p>5.   POST APPRECIATES SUPPORT FROM DEPARTMENT AND USAID/BHR </p><p>  AND AFR/SA ON THIS HIGH PRIORITY MATTER. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02508  02 OF 02  241031Z </p><p> </p><p>ROTH </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
