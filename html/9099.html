This is an action request.  Please see para. 4 </p><p> </p><p>2. On July 1, the Ambassador sent a letter to Minister of </p><p>State for Foreign Affairs Sheikh Hamdan Bin Zayed Al-Nahyan </p><p>and to Minister of Economy and Commerce Sheikh Fahim Al- </p><p>Qassimi to express our concern about the GCC decision to </p><p>implement a conformity assessment program for foreign </p><p>imports similar to Saudi Arabia\'s International Conformity </p><p>Certification Program (ICCP).  The Ambassador stressed our </p><p>belief that the program may contradict the UAE\'s WTO </p><p>obligations and that it might complicate the UAE\'s interest </p><p>in concluding a Free Trade agreement with the U.S.  She </p><p>also asked that the UAE delay implementing this decision </p><p>until USG experts could discuss concerns with the UAEG in </p><p>more detail. </p><p> </p><p>3. Acting DCM and Econ Chief made the same points in a </p><p>meeting with Ministry of Finance Assistant Undersecretary </p><p>Khalid Al Bustani on June 29. Al-Bustani stressed that the </p><p>UAE would not impose one set of standards on imports and </p><p>another set of standards on domestically manufactured </p><p>products.  He noted, however, that the UAE needed to set </p><p>standards and that it did not have the resources to create </p><p>a set of standards on its own but would adopt GCC wide </p><p>standards.  He asked for more detailed information on </p><p>specific problems with the standards themselves. </p><p> </p><p>4. Action Request:  Please provide post with more </p><p>information on specific USG objections to the standards </p><p>that we can pass to UAE standards experts.  End Action </p><p>Request. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
