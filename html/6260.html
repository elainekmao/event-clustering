<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 001433 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/09/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PHUM, IZ, JO, MEPP </p><p>SUBJECT: LOOKING AHEAD: JORDANIAN ELECTIONS AFTER AN IRAQ </p><p>WAR:  A CHANCE TO SHOWCASE DEMOCRACY? </p><p> </p><p>REF: AMMAN 1336 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edward W. Gnehm.  Reasons 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) We believe it is essential that we start to think </p><p>seriously about Jordan\'s position in a post-Iraq war </p><p>environment: what the GOJ will expect us to do, and how </p><p>Jordan can contribute to achieving our longer term regional </p><p>goals.  Assuming that a military campaign is of limited </p><p>duration and fully successful, the King will focus on a </p><p>number of issues soon after military action ceases.  These </p><p>will include pushing for (1) a renewed U.S. emphasis on the </p><p>MEPP and (2) a positive and credible U.S. message to the </p><p>region that will reinforce his own domestic reform efforts. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Looking to our own priorities, Jordan\'s parliamentary </p><p>elections now scheduled for June 17 (reftel) will offer an </p><p>important (and probably the first post-war) opportunity for </p><p>the U.S. to highlight and encourage democracy in the Arab </p><p>world.  Given the deep skepticism that permeates Arab </p><p>perceptions of U.S. ambitions in the region, we will need to </p><p>quickly find ways to demonstrate that our democratizing </p><p>rhetoric prior to military action is translated into concrete </p><p>and positive expression following it.  Jordanian </p><p>Parliamentary elections that are free, fair, and credible </p><p>could help provide a timely model for the President\'s vision </p><p>of a reformed and progressive Middle East.  To that end, we </p><p>should think at two levels: (1) helping create the broader </p><p>political context in the region that will facilitate the kind </p><p>of campaign and election results that support our interests </p><p>in broadening democracy in the Arab world generally, and (2) </p><p>providing (at a programmatic level and with a light touch) </p><p>assistance that facilitates the electoral process without </p><p>appearing to meddle.  If we do this right, it could have </p><p>positive effects not only for Jordan, but for our influence, </p><p>both long and short-term, in the Post-Saddam Middle East. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>A Reenergized MEPP: </p><p>Step 1 in Rebuilding Credibility with The Street </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) As the King, FM and PM have all made clear to senior </p><p>Washington decision makers, there is no more important issue </p><p>in the hearts and minds of Jordanians than Palestine.  The </p><p>relentless conflict between Palestinians and Israelis, and </p><p>the belief among most here that the U.S. has abdicated its </p><p>historic role as "honest broker," has done more to hurt U.S. </p><p>credibility with the average Jordanian than any other single </p><p>factor -- and, in turn, has forced the GOJ to adopt a </p><p>defensive tone when characterizing the U.S.-Jordan </p><p>relationship to its citizens. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) In order to begin to reverse this current reality, the </p><p>King will press us to move forward quickly to reenergize the </p><p>MEPP and demonstrate clearly the political will to restart </p><p>serious negotiations, press Israel to take positive steps, </p><p>and forge a solution that brings peace and security to both </p><p>Israelis and Palestinians.  In and of itself, such an </p><p>approach will not mend our frayed image and influence. </p><p>Without it, however, the task is likely to be impossible. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>A Message We (And He) Can Take to the People </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) A broader USG message should also address the </p><p>corrosive effects of months of virulent anti-American </p><p>rhetoric throughout the region.  By demonstrating -- through </p><p>our actions not only our words -- that we are on the side of </p><p>average people, and that our actions are emphatically not "a </p><p>war against Islam," the greater resonance our efforts will </p><p>have with Jordanian audiences.  This will help not only to </p><p>rebuild a pro-U.S. constituency in the Kingdom, but will also </p><p>help support the King\'s own program to steer Jordan in a </p><p>progressive, pro-Western direction. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p>June 17 Elections: Showcasing Democracy in the Arab World </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) As we consider what the King and GOJ will ask of us </p><p>and how we can help Jordan after a war, we should recognize </p><p>that political developments here will inevitably contribute </p><p>greatly to the pattern of our goals and strategy for the </p><p>region in the eyes of Jordanians and all their neighbors.  An </p><p>important marker in this regard will be the upcoming </p><p>Parliamentary elections -- which the PM recently announced </p><p>would be held on June 17.  If handled adroitly, these </p><p>elections may offer a timely opportunity to highlight the </p><p>possibilities and promise of democracy in the Arab world. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) It is in our interests -- and the GOJ\'s -- that these </p><p>elections be inclusive, spirited, and reflect a broad debate </p><p>on Jordan\'s future.  The structure of the elections -- </p><p>single-member constituencies -- will almost certainly result </p><p>in a pro-Hashemite majority, but one with traditional tribal </p><p>views.  That said, we would also want to see an end result </p><p>that reflects a genuine commitment to democratic reforms. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) In our view, the best way to accomplish this objective </p><p>is to help create the broader political context that </p><p>neutralizes those issues that detract attention from that </p><p>agenda:  the most obvious example being Palestine.  The </p><p>relative popularity of the Islamic Action Front (IAF), the </p><p>political wing of the Muslim Brotherhood, is rooted more in </p><p>its steadfast rhetorical support for the Palestinian cause </p><p>and opposition to an Iraq war than in its policy </p><p>prescriptions for Jordan.  If we can take those two hot </p><p>button issues off the table, and the GOJ can show near-term </p><p>tangible benefits for Jordanians following the cessation of </p><p>hostilities, the likelihood of a strong showing by pro-reform </p><p>candidates could increase significantly. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) In addition to taking policy steps to help create a </p><p>more favorable political climate for democratic progress, we </p><p>should also look for ways that the U.S. can help facilitate </p><p>the election process itself programatically.  Given the deep </p><p>suspicions that the U.S. intends to "redraw the map" and </p><p>impose its own political design on the Arabs, we must </p><p>scrupulously avoid any appearance of trying to influence the </p><p>election\'s outcome.  Whenever possible we should assist the </p><p>elections through NGO\'s and follow a multinational approach, </p><p>possibly in cooperation with the Europeans and Japanese.  We </p><p>should also ensure that any assistance to candidates (e.g. </p><p>speaker programs or training) be available to all potential </p><p>candidates who do not pose any security concerns.  Clearly, </p><p>this is a delicate matter for the GOJ.  That said, a careful </p><p>offering of traditionally successful programs such as guest </p><p>speakers on democracy and voter education programs could </p><p>provide useful ways to spur popular interest and solidify </p><p>credibility for the event and its outcome.  If done right, </p><p>the Jordanian example could help communicate to a wider </p><p>regional audience that the vision of reform in the middle </p><p>east is neither a distant possibility, nor a scheme to </p><p>benefit outsiders in the West. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C)  We should also recognize that the elections and the </p><p>campaign period leading up to them is likely to come during a </p><p>period in which the economy is buffeted by the loss of the </p><p>"special" economic relationship with Iraq that Jordan has </p><p>enjoyed for the past decade in terms of cut price oil </p><p>supplies and a protected market for Jordanian exports.  The </p><p>end of this relationship, plus the effects of lower tourism </p><p>and export revenues expected to coincide with a war, is </p><p>likely to mean job losses for low income Jordanians and </p><p>higher prices for some oil products.  To some extent, these </p><p>effects will be concentrated in areas of the country -- </p><p>poorer parts of Amman and the south -- that have been the </p><p>biggest beneficiaries of the Iraq relationship. </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) The short-term economic consequences of a war are </p><p>likely to strain Jordan\'s political fabric, and to test the </p><p>commitment to sound economic policies and fiscal discipline </p><p>that has undergirded the impressive strength of recent </p><p>economic performance.  The King and his advisers are counting </p><p>on economic assistance from the United States and other </p><p>countries (including Gulf oil suppliers) to blunt the </p><p>economic and political impact of these short-term disruptions </p><p>by smoothing out the adjustment process over time.  Still, </p><p>maintaining the balance between smoothing the economic </p><p>adjustment and avoiding loss of macroeconomic control in a </p><p>pre-election environment will be a delicate issue on which we </p><p>will have to work closely with the Jordanians. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
