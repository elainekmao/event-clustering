<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 KATHMANDU 000696 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, ASEC, CASC, PINR, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: NEW MAOIST TACTIC: ATTACK INFRASTRUCTURE </p><p> </p><p>REFERENCE: KATHMANDU 632 </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary.  In an apparent change of tactics, </p><p>Nepal\'s Maoist insurgents have begun a systematic campaign </p><p>of attacks against the kingdom\'s infrastructure.  In </p><p>recent days the Maoists have hit bridges - including one </p><p>in the capital - telephone repeater towers, hydropower </p><p>stations, electricity sub-stations, government buildings </p><p>and Village Development Committee (VDC) offices.  In two </p><p>areas the Maoists have cut off drinking water pipelines to </p><p>remote communities.  The attacks make clear that the </p><p>Maoists intend to cripple the government\'s ability to </p><p>operate in the countryside even at the cost of severe </p><p>hardship to the populace.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Maoists Target Infrastructure </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Nepal\'s Maoists have apparently shifted tactics </p><p>and embarked on a systematic campaign against the </p><p>kingdom\'s infrastructure.  In recent days they have </p><p>targeted various types of tactical military targets, </p><p>including bridges, hydroelectric and electrical power </p><p>plants, telephone repeater towers, water supplies, </p><p>government offices, and airports.  [Note:  We understand </p><p>that next week EU Heads of Missions plan to release a </p><p>press statement condemning Maoist attacks against Nepal\'s </p><p>infrastructure, and calling on the Maoists to cease their </p><p>attacks and pursue their objectives peacefully.  End </p><p>Note.] </p><p> </p><p>Bridges Targeted </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Bridges are the most obvious example.  During a </p><p>March 30 attack, a bridge at Kumalgadhi on the Tulsipur- </p><p>Surkhet road was damaged, cutting off the western part of </p><p>Dang district - as well as adjacent areas of Salyan and </p><p>Surkhet districts - from the rest of the country.  During </p><p>the night of April 1, Maoists struck three bridges in </p><p>Bardiya district, including the Mankhola Bridge in the </p><p>Nepalgunj-Guleria segment of the Nepal\'s main East-West </p><p>artery, which links the airport at Nepalgunj with Royal </p><p>Bardiya National Park.  [Note: Bardiya district borders </p><p>the state of Uttar Pradesh in India.]  In Kathmandu on </p><p>March 29, twenty-six people were injured when a bomb </p><p>exploded in the middle of Kalimati Bridge, according to </p><p>the Defense Ministry (Reftel).  Five of the injured remain </p><p>in critical condition. </p><p> </p><p>Attacks on Telephone Repeater Stations </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Maoists have damaged more than 37 telephone </p><p>repeater stations in 25 of Nepal\'s 75 districts. </p><p>According to the Nepal Telecommunications Corporation, </p><p>telephone service has been completely cut off in twelve </p><p>districts:  Achham, Lamjung, Darchula, Bajhang, Dhading, </p><p>Solukhumbu, Rasuwa, Jajarkot, Rukum, Humla, Arghakhanchi </p><p>and Gulmi.  In other districts, communications links have </p><p>been reestablished with the help of MART telephone lines, </p><p>VHF telephone systems and trunk call sets.  The Ministry </p><p>of Information and Communications told us that they have </p><p>not yet repaired the damaged repeater stations, and added </p><p>that Nepal would need foreign technical assistance for </p><p>that purpose. </p><p> </p><p>Hydropower and Electricity Stations Vandalized </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Maoist attacks on hydropower and electric </p><p>stations have disrupted power supplies in parts of the </p><p>country.  On March 9, the Maoists detonated a bomb at the </p><p>Chandrauta electricity sub-station in the western Terai </p><p>district of Kapilbastu, leaving most of the district </p><p>without power.  [Note:  Power to some parts of this border </p><p>district is supplied from India; these areas were not </p><p>affected by the blackout.]  The Maoists detonated a bomb </p><p>at a hydropower project in Jhimruk, in mid-western Pyuthan </p><p>district March 30.  The resultant damage left Pyuthan, </p><p>Gulmi and Rolpa districts in darkness.  Similarly, Maoists </p><p>bombed an electric plant in eastern Nepal\'s Panchthar </p><p>district April 2.  The plant\'s generator and transmitter </p><p>were completely destroyed, and the district headquarters </p><p>and surrounding areas remain without power.  The Nepal </p><p>Electricity Authority\'s Managing Director informed us that </p><p>in early March the Maoists damaged three small hydropower </p><p>stations - one each in Bhojpur, Sankhuwasabha and Dhankuta </p><p>districts.  Maoists have reportedly threatened to attack </p><p>these stations again if they are repaired. </p><p> </p><p>Maoists Cut Off Water Supply </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Taking another chapter from the global </p><p>insurgents\' handbook, Maoists have cut off water supplies </p><p>in two districts.  The water supply to the headquarters </p><p>(capital) of Okhaldhunga district was cut off after </p><p>Maoists destroyed the intake mechanism at the source of </p><p>the drinking water supply March 30.  Insurgents cut off </p><p>the water supply to Narayan municipality, Dailekh </p><p>district, on April 2, by damaging the reservoir tank and </p><p>pipeline.  Reports indicate that local residents face a </p><p>severe drinking water crisis. </p><p> </p><p>Government Offices Sacked </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) The Maoists have also stepped up their attacks on </p><p>government facilities around the country.  In Kailali </p><p>district, Maoists March 30 bombed and burned the offices </p><p>of the Agriculture Development Bank, National Commercial </p><p>Bank and several post offices.  In Nawalparasi district </p><p>the rebels set fire to a branch office of the Nepal </p><p>Electricity Authority March 31.  The arsonists forced </p><p>office staff to vacate the building before lighting the </p><p>fire.  In Dolkha district, Maoists raided the Border </p><p>Administration Office and Customs Office in Lamabagar, a </p><p>small town bordering Tibet, on April 2.  In Rukum district </p><p>on the same day, Maoists damaged the offices of a half- </p><p>dozen government agencies as well as Care Nepal.  They </p><p>also damaged the airport tower.  Also on April 2, Maoists </p><p>attacked five area post offices and the veterinary and </p><p>forest offices in Ramechhap district.  In at least two </p><p>districts in recent days the Maoists have torched health </p><p>sub-posts, which in Nepal distribute medicines and basic </p><p>first aid to villagers living in poor, remote areas. </p><p> </p><p>Attack on Airport in Remote Dolpa District </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) A Maoist bomb destroyed the airport tower in </p><p>Dolpa district during the night of April 2.  Army barracks </p><p>nearby were also torched.  Maoists struck the airport </p><p>after the army contingent had returned to the district\'s </p><p>headquarters.  Dolpa is one of Nepal\'s most remote </p><p>districts, with no road links with other parts of the </p><p>country. </p><p> </p><p>Fevered Attacks on Village-Level Offices </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) The Defense Ministry reported that more than 50 </p><p>Village Development Committee (VDC) offices across the </p><p>country were destroyed in the past week.  Thirty-seven of </p><p>those were attacked in Dang district alone on the night of </p><p>March 29, the Assistant Chief District Officer (CDO) for </p><p>Dang confirmed.  Between March 29 and April 2, Maoists </p><p>attacked VDC offices in Chitwan, Pyuthan, Morang, Ilam, </p><p>Baglung and Kailali districts.  The District Police Office </p><p>in Sindhuli confirmed that on March 30, seven of the </p><p>districts\' VDC offices were sacked by Maoists.  The </p><p>Maoists also destroyed four VDCs in Taplejung district and </p><p>five in Myagdi district on April 2. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) These obviously well-planned and coordinated </p><p>strikes against the nation\'s infrastructure were in part </p><p>calculated to frighten the populace into observing the </p><p>Maoists\' planned general strike of April 2-6 (now </p><p>postponed).  However, they also give a clear indication </p><p>that the insurgents\' strategy has evolved.  By attacking </p><p>bridges, electrical power stations, communications towers </p><p>and even the water supply, the Maoists have made it clear </p><p>that they intend to cripple the government\'s ability to </p><p>operate in the hinterland, even if it means inflicting </p><p>severe hardship and economic deprivation on millions of </p><p>Nepalese. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
