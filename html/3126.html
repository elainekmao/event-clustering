SUMMARY: INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS CONTINUES A FRONT- </p><p>BURNER ISSUE AMONG THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND SOME GOVERNMENT </p><p>AGENCIES IN VIETNAM.  THIS CABLE SUMMARIZES TWO RECENT IPR </p><p>SEMINARS IN HANOI SPONSORED BY FRANCE AND SWITZERLAND AND </p><p>WHICH INCLUDED PARTICIPATION BY THE EMBASSY ECONOMIC </p><p>SECTION, THE USAID-FUNDED STAR PROJECT, AND A NUMBER OF U.S. </p><p>FIRMS. IT WAS CLEAR FROM BOTH SEMINARS THAT THERE IS A GREAT </p><p>DEAL OF INTEREST FROM BOTH FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC FIRMS IN </p><p>VIETNAM ON WHO THE ENFORCEMENT PLAYERS ARE AND HOW THE </p><p>PROCESS SHOULD WORK.  IT WAS ALSO CLEAR THAT, SPURRED BY </p><p>THEIR OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE U.S.-VIETNAM BILATERAL TRADE </p><p>AGREEMENT, VIETNAMESE AGENCIES INVOLVED IN IPR ENFORCEMENT </p><p>ARE BEGINNING TO EXAMINE THEIR ROLES AND IDENTIFY AREAS </p><p>WHERE THEY LACK CAPACITY AND TRAINING. WHILE THE LARGER </p><p>LEGAL CONTEXT FOR IPR PROTECTION APPEARS TO BE ON TRACK, </p><p>THERE REMAINS A GENERAL LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF IPR </p><p>PROTECTION AMONG AUTHORITIES, FIRMS AND THE PUBLIC AND A </p><p>LACK OF CLEAR OPERATING GUIDELINES FOR AGENCIES CHARGED WITH </p><p>IPR ENFORCEMENT IN THE FIELD.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>FRANCE AND THE EU FOCUS ON ASIA </p><p> </p><p> 2.  IN MAY, THE FRENCH NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF INDUSTRIAL </p><p>PROPERTY, IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, THE </p><p>VIETNAMESE, THAI AND MALAYSIAN GOVERNMENTS AND A NUMBER OF </p><p>PRIVATE SECTOR FIRMS (INCLUDING MICROSOFT AT OUR </p><p>SUGGESTION), SPONSORED A REGIONAL CONFERENCE IN HANOI ON THE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  01523  01 OF 03  130517Z </p><p>FUTURE FOR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IN ASIA.  WHILE THE </p><p>CONFERENCE WAS NOT VIETNAM SPECIFIC, THE EMBASSY WAS INVITED </p><p>TO BRIEF THE CONFERENCE PARTICIPANTS ON THE IPR PROVISIONS </p><p>IN THE U.S. VIETNAM BILATERAL TRADE AGREEMENT (BTA) AND ON </p><p>OUR WORK WITH VIETNAM ON ITS IMPLEMENTATION.  SINCE THE </p><p>CONFERENCE TOOK PLACE SHORTLY AFTER THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF </p><p>USTR\'S SPECIAL 301 REPORT, OUR TALK INCLUDED A SHORT </p><p>REFERENCE TO THOSE CONCLUSIONS.  WE STRESSED THAT THE U.S. </p><p>APPROACH WAS TO ADDRESS IPR ISSUES FIRST IN THE MULTILATERAL </p><p>CONTEXT, THEN REGIONAL OR BILATERAL, AND ONLY WHEN THOSE </p><p>APPROACHES WERE NOT SUFFICIENTLY EFFECTIVE, DID WE USE ALL </p><p>OTHER TOOLS AVAILABLE TO ENSURE ADEQUATE PROTECTION OF IPR. </p><p>MANY OF THE EUROPEAN PARTICIPANTS (AND SOME OF THE REGIONAL) </p><p>PROFESSED A PREFERENCE FOR "VOLUNTARY" MEASURES TO INCREASE </p><p>IPR PROTECTION IN ASIA, BUT IT WAS CLEAR THAT THE U.S. WAS </p><p>THE ONLY COUNTRY ABLE TO SHOW SPECIFIC PROGRESS WITH VIETNAM </p><p>ON IPR ISSUES, THANKS TO THE BTA.  IN ADDITION TO OUR </p><p>EMBASSY SPEAKER, THE USAID-FUNDED STAR PROJECT ALSO </p><p>PARTICIPATED IN THE SEMINAR\'S WORKSHOP ON DEVELOPMENT OF </p><p>TECHNICAL COOPERATION. </p><p> </p><p>SWITZERLAND FOCUSES ON IPR ENFORCMENT </p><p> </p><p>3.  ALSO IN MAY, THE SWISS PUT ON ONE OF THE MOST USEFUL IPR </p><p>SEMINARS TO DATE IN HANOI, ENTITLED "SEMINAR ON INDUSTRIAL </p><p>PROPERTY AND THE INTEGRATION OF VIETNAM INTO THE </p><p>MULTILATERAL TRADE SYSTEM - ENFORCEMENT" AND ORGANIZED BY </p><p>THE "SPECIAL PROGRAMME OF COOPERATION BETWEEN VIETNAM AND </p><p>SWITZERLAND IN THE FIELD OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.  SPEAKERS </p><p>INCLUDED SOME OF THE VIETNAMESE GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS IN </p><p>CHARGE OF IPR PROTECTION AND ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS.  SOME </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  01523  01 OF 03  130517Z </p><p>HIGHLIGHTS OF THE CONFERENCE FOLLOW BELOW. </p><p> </p><p>WTO - TRIPS AND DOHA </p><p> </p><p>4.  THE VIETNAMESE FIRMS AND GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS PRESENT </p><p>WERE PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN THE SESSION ON "THE WTO </p><p>AFTER THE DOHA MINISTERIAL CONFERENCE - IP: PATENT, </p><p>GEOGRAPHICAL INDICATIONS AND TRADITIONAL KNOWLEDGE", </p><p>PRESENTED BY DR. FELIX ADDOR, CHIEF LEGAL OFFICER AND DEPUTY </p><p>DIRECTOR GENERAL, SWISS FEDERAL INSTITUTE OF IP. MUCH OF THE </p><p>Q&A SESSION WAS RELATED TO TRADITIONAL MEDICINES. OTHER </p><p>SESSIONS INCLUDED TRIPS OBLIGATIONS AND ENFORCEMENT ISSUES, </p><p>INCLUDING DISPUTE SETTLEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>5.  DR. PHAM DINH CHUONG, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL OFFICE OF </p><p>INDUSTRIAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, ADDRESSED THE SESSION ON </p><p>"ACCESSION NEGOTIATIONS OF VIETNAM TO THE WTO: STATE OF PLAY </p><p>IN THE FIELD OF IP."  HE REVIEWED THE LATEST DEVELOPMENTS IN </p><p>THE NEGOTIATIONS WITHIN THE WTO WORKING GROUP ON IP.  HE </p><p>TOLD THE AUDIENCE THAT VIETNAM HAD BUILT AN AMBITIOUS ACTION </p><p>PLAN ON IPR, NAMELY TRIPS.  VIETNAM HAD EXPECTED TO BE FULLY </p><p>IN COMPLIANCE WITH TRIPS ON JANUARY 01, 2002. UP TO NOW, THE </p><p>PLAN HAS NOT BEEN FINISHED. HOWEVER, ACCORDING TO DR. </p><p>CHUONG, VIETNAM HAS REACHED SOME MOST IMPORTANT TARGETS, FOR </p><p>EXAMPLE, ON THE LEGAL IMPLEMENTATION OF TRIPS, VIETNAM\'S </p><p>LEGAL SYSTEM IS ONLY SHORT OF REGULATIONS ON PROTECTION OF </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ6987 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HANOI  01523  02 OF 03  130518Z </p><p>ACTION EB-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AGRE-00  AID-00   AMAD-00  CEA-01   CIAE-00  CTME-00 </p><p>      DINT-00  DODE-00  ITCE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  EAP-00   EXME-00 </p><p>      OIGO-00  E-00     FAAE-00  UTED-00  VC-00    FRB-00   H-01 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   ITC-01   LAB-01   LOC-01   L-00     VCE-00 </p><p>      AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OES-01   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00 </p><p>      PRS-00   ACE-00   SP-00    SSO-00   SS-00    STR-00   TEST-00 </p><p>      TRSE-00  USIE-00  EPAE-00  DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00 </p><p>        /011W </p><p>                  ------------------BC54B9  130518Z /38 </p><p>P 130516Z JUN 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HANOI </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 6753 </p><p>INFO AMCONSUL HO CHI MINH CITY </p><p>USDOC WASHDC </p><p>USDA WASHDC </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 03 HANOI 001523 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EB/IPC:DRBEAN, EAP/BCLTV AND EB/ODC </p><p>STATE ALSO PASS USTR BURCKY/ALVAREZ AND BRYAN </p><p>STATE ALSO PASS USPTO FOR URBAN </p><p>STATE ALSO PASS LIBRARY OF CONGRESS FOR TEPP </p><p>USDA FOR FAS/FAA/AO HUETE </p><p>USDOC FOR LASHLEY AND 4431/MAC/AP/OKSA/HPPHO </p><p>USDOC ALSO FOR ITA/TD/OTEA/JJANICKE AND ITA/TD/SIF/CMUIR </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  01523  02 OF 03  130518Z </p><p> </p><p>LAYOUT DESIGN OF INTEGRATED CIRCUITS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  ACCORDING TO DR. CHUONG, IN THE CONTEXT OF ITS WTO </p><p>ACCESSION TALKS, VIETNAM HAS ALREADY FINISHED THE </p><p>"TRANSPARENCY" PHASE. VIETNAM IS NOW MOVING TO "SUBSTANTIAL </p><p>NEGOTIATION" PHASE.  HE NOTED THAT THE  LATEST NEGOTIATION </p><p>WAS HELD IN GENEVA ON APRIL 12-18, 2002 AND THAT DURING </p><p>THOSE TALKS THE U.S, EU, AUSTRALIA AND SWITZERLAND HAD RATED </p><p>HIGHLY VIETNAM\'S EFFORT ON CREATING AN ADEQUATE LEGAL </p><p>STRUCTURE FOR IPR PROTECTION. HOWEVER, HE NOTED THAT VIETNAM </p><p>STILL HAS TO CONFRONT BIG CHALLENGES IN EFFECTIVE </p><p>ENFORCEMENT. AS REGARDS ENFORCEMENT, VIETNAM HAS PUT SPECIAL </p><p>EMPHASIS ON ADMINISTRATION REMEDIES TO PREVENT AND DEAL WITH </p><p>IPR VIOLATIONS. BUT, HE ADMITTED THAT IPR VIOLATIONS ARE A </p><p>REAL "HEADACHE ISSUE" IN VIETNAM WITH INCREASINGLY MORE </p><p>COMPLICATED INFRINGEMENT SITUATIONS. COUNTERFEIT AND PIRATED </p><p>PRODUCTS ARE SOLD PUBLICLY THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. </p><p>REGARDING COMPLETION OF AN EFFECTIVE IPR REGIME IN VIETNAM </p><p>THAT IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH TRIPS, DR. CHUONG NOTED EFFECTIVE </p><p>ENFORCEMENT IS THE GREATEST CHALLENGE AND NUMBER ONE TARGET </p><p>OF VIETNAM. </p><p> </p><p>TRADEMARK ENFORCEMENT DRAWS INTEREST </p><p> </p><p>7.  ANOTHER AUDIENCE GRABBING SESSION WAS "TRADEMARK </p><p>ENFORCEMENT: AN INSIDER\'S VIEW", PRESENTED BY BHARAT DUBE, </p><p>IP COUNSEL, RICHEMONT INTERNATIONAL.  DUBE USED CASE STUDIES </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  01523  02 OF 03  130518Z </p><p>(INCLUDING CARTIER) TO ILLUSTRATE THE TYPES OF </p><p>COUNTERFEITING ACTIVITIES THAT TAKE PLACE AND METHODS OF </p><p>INVESTIGATION, INCLUDING HOW TO DEVELOP EVIDENCE FOR LOCAL </p><p>LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND HOW TO GET THEM TO ACT ON THAT </p><p>EVIDENCE. THE PARTICIPANTS WERE CLEARLY INTERESTED IN THIS </p><p>ISSUE AND IN UNDERSTANDING THE ROLES OF EACH OF DIFFERENT </p><p>ELEMENTS INVOLVING IN IPR ENFORCEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>CUSTOMS LAYS OUT PROBLEMS AND FUTURE ACTIONS </p><p> </p><p>8. VU NGOC ANH, DIRECTOR, INSTITUTE FOR CUSTOM RESEARCH, </p><p>GENERAL DEPARTMENT OF CUSTOM MADE A SPEECH ON "VIETNAMESE </p><p>CUSTOMS\' EXPERIENCE IN IP ENFORCEMENT". HE SAID VIETNAM\'S </p><p>CUSTOMS DEPARTMENT PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN IPR PROTECTION </p><p>RELATED TO IMPORTS AND EXPORTS. HOWEVER, CUSTOMS\' </p><p>ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS ARE STILL LIMITED. THE MAIN REASONS WERE </p><p>THE LACK OF AWARENESS OF IPR PROTECTION BY CUSTOMS </p><p>OFFICIALS, THE SHORTAGE OF SPECIALIZED CUSTOMS IPR SECTIONS, </p><p>AND CONSEQUENTLY, INCONSISTENT GUIDANCE WITHIN CUSTOMS ON </p><p>IPR ENFORCEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>9.  ANH SAID THE CUSTOMS DEPARTMENT NEEDS TO DO THE </p><p>FOLLOWING TASKS IN THE FUTURE. FIRST, BUILD SPECIALIZED IPR </p><p>SECTIONS IN THE GENERAL DEPARTMENT OF CUSTOMS AS WELL AS IN </p><p>LOCAL CUSTOMS OFFICES WITH A DATABASE SYSTEM FOR KEEPING </p><p>TRACK OF GOODS AND TO COMPARE THE IMPORT OR EXPORT OF GOODS </p><p>THAT HAVE REGISTERED TRADEMARKS OR COPYRIGHTS. SECOND, TRAIN </p><p>THE PROFESSIONAL CUSTOMS STAFF TO INCREASE AWARENESS OF IPR </p><p>PROTECTION. THIRD, SET UP A MECHANISM FOR IPR HOLDERS TO </p><p>REQUEST IPR PROTECTION ON A LONG-TERM AND CASE-BY-CASE </p><p>BASIS. FINALLY, PUSH FOR INCREASED INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  01523  02 OF 03  130518Z </p><p>WITH OTHER COUNTRIES TO GET MORE EXPERIENCE IN IPR </p><p>ENFORCEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>MARKET MANAGEMENT BUREAU EXPLAINS ITS ENFORCEMENT ROLE </p><p> </p><p>10. LE THE BAO, DIRECTOR, MARKET MANAGEMENT BUREAU ("MMB") </p><p>PRESENTED "MARKET MANAGEMENT ENFORCERS WITH COUNTERFEIT AND </p><p>INDUSTRIAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT FIGHTING". (NOTE:  THE MMB </p><p>IS THE STATE AGENCY RESPONSIBLE FOR DOMESTIC COMMERCE. IN </p><p>TERMS OF IPR PROTECTION, MMB IS RESPONSIBLE FOR INSPECTING </p><p>FOR AND DEALING WITH COUNTERFEIT TRADEMARKS AND INDUSTRIAL </p><p>PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT.  MMB HAS COOPERATED WITH A NUMBER OF </p><p>COUNTRIES ON TRADEMARK ENFORCEMENT, IN PARTICULAR WITH </p><p>FRANCE ON A PROJECT FOR THE PROTECTION FOR APPELLATION OF </p><p>ORIGIN OF GOODS.)  BAO OUTLINED THE MEASURES TAKEN BY MMB TO </p><p>PROTECT IPR, SUCH AS STRENGTHENING PUBLIC AWARENESS, </p><p>ENHANCING COOPERATION BETWEEN IPR ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND </p><p>IPR ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCIES, AND ENCOURAGING ENTERPRISES TO </p><p>ACTIVELY PROTECT THEIR PRODUCTS. BAO ALSO NOTED THAT THE MMB </p><p>FACES A NUMBER OF DIFFICULTIES IN TAKING ACTION AGAINST </p><p>COUNTERFEIT AND IPR INFRINGEMENT. IN PARTICULAR, HE SAID </p><p>THAT THE CURRENT LEGAL GUIDELINES THAT APPLIED TO THE MMB\'S </p><p>WORK WERE AT TIMES UNCLEAR AND MADE A SOLID LEGAL </p><p>DETERMINATION OF INFRINGEMENT MORE COMPLICATED AND </p><p>"CONTROVERSIAL."  FOR EXAMPLE, BAO CLAIMED THAT A NUMBER OF </p><p>LEGAL GUIDELINES MENTION THE CONCEPT OF "USE OF A SIGN THAT </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ6988 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HANOI  01523  03 OF 03  130518Z </p><p>ACTION EB-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AGRE-00  AID-00   AMAD-00  CEA-01   CIAE-00  CTME-00 </p><p>      DINT-00  DODE-00  ITCE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  EAP-00   EXME-00 </p><p>      OIGO-00  E-00     FAAE-00  UTED-00  VC-00    FRB-00   H-01 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   ITC-01   LAB-01   LOC-01   L-00     VCE-00 </p><p>      AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OES-01   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00 </p><p>      PRS-00   ACE-00   SP-00    SSO-00   SS-00    STR-00   TEST-00 </p><p>      TRSE-00  USIE-00  EPAE-00  DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00 </p><p>        /011W </p><p>                  ------------------BC54BD  130518Z /38 </p><p>P 130516Z JUN 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HANOI </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 6754 </p><p>INFO AMCONSUL HO CHI MINH CITY </p><p>USDOC WASHDC </p><p>USDA WASHDC </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 03 OF 03 HANOI 001523 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EB/IPC:DRBEAN, EAP/BCLTV AND EB/ODC </p><p>STATE ALSO PASS USTR BURCKY/ALVAREZ AND BRYAN </p><p>STATE ALSO PASS USPTO FOR URBAN </p><p>STATE ALSO PASS LIBRARY OF CONGRESS FOR TEPP </p><p>USDA FOR FAS/FAA/AO HUETE </p><p>USDOC FOR LASHLEY AND 4431/MAC/AP/OKSA/HPPHO </p><p>USDOC ALSO FOR ITA/TD/OTEA/JJANICKE AND ITA/TD/SIF/CMUIR </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  01523  03 OF 03  130518Z </p><p> </p><p>IS IDENTICAL OR SIMILAR TO THE PROTECTED TRADEMARK" OR "USE </p><p>OF A SIGN THAT IS EASY TO CAUSE CONFUSION."    BAO CONCLUDED </p><p>THAT THE CONCEPT OF IPR IN VIETNAM WAS STILL A NEW AND </p><p>"SENSITIVE" MATTER. AWARENESS OF IPR PROTECTION AMONG THOSE </p><p>WHO ARE SUPPOSED TO ENFORCE THE LAW, THE PRODUCERS, THE </p><p>TRADERS AND THE PUBLIC IS VERY LIMITED. </p><p> </p><p>COURTS NEED SEPARATE IPR CODE AND BETTER LITIGATION LAW </p><p> </p><p>11.

THE </p><p>PRESENTATION OUTLINED THE COURT\'S ROLE AND VIETNAM\'S CIVIL </p><p>AND CRIMINAL LITIGATION PROCEDURES FOR SETTLING IPR </p><p>DISPUTES. HE NOTED THAT VIETNAM NEEDS TO COMPLETE LEGAL </p><p>REGULATIONS ON IPR, IN PARTICULAR, TO PROMULGATE A SEPARATE </p><p>IPR CODE AND TO PERFECT LITIGATION LAW. </p><p> </p><p>12.
