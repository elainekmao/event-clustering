<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 04 KABUL 001007 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR ZKHALILZAD, JDWORKEN, HMANN, RHANSON, DSEDNEY </p><p>DEPT FOR SA/PAB, SA/AR, S/CT </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/17/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PINR, PTER, AF, PK </p><p>SUBJECT: SE KHALILZAD\'S APRIL 11 MEETING WITH FM ABDULLAH </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMBASSADOR ROBERT P. FINN FOR REASONS </p><p>1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: During his April 11 meeting with FM Abdullah, </p><p>SE Khalilzad addressed both regional and domestic Afghan </p><p>developments.  Khalilzad suggested that the renewed activity </p><p>of the Taliban and other destabilizing elements in the South </p><p>might be addressed through a trilateral </p><p>(U.S.-Afghan-Pakistani) working group.  Abdullah responded </p><p>favorably to this proposal, noting he welcomed improving </p><p>relations with Pakistan.  Khalilzad also sought Abdullah,s </p><p>views on priority domestic issues that demanded immediate </p><p>attention.  FM Abdullah suggested that the top three priority </p><p>issues were ensuring successful results for the </p><p>Constitutional Commission, the Election Commission, and </p><p>ANA/NDS reform.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>============================== </p><p>SE Khalilzad Offers Trilateral </p><p>Working Group Proposal </p><p>============================== </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) SE Khalilzad met with Afghan FM Abdullah on April 11 </p><p>to review conditions in Afghanistan.  Accompanying Khalilzad </p><p>were the Ambassador, NSC,s Rebecca Hanson, DOD/OSD,s </p><p>Mustafa Popal and Econ/Commoff (notetaker).  SE Khalilzad </p><p>began discussions by noting his concern about the poor state </p><p>of Afghan-Pakistan relations.  The recent killing of an ICRC </p><p>worker in Kandahar and reported Pakistani and Taliban </p><p>cross-border incursions were of great concern to Washington. </p><p>SE Khalilzad proposed a trilateral arrangement as a means to </p><p>address this growing problem.  He proposed further that </p><p>CJTF-180 commander, General McNeill, could head a high-level </p><p>standing committee which would meet monthly.  Others could </p><p>form a working-level body that could meet more frequently. </p><p>The goal of these trilateral arrangements would be to stop </p><p>all Taliban activities in Afghanistan.  Khalilzad noted he </p><p>had not yet proposed this idea to President Karzai and hoped </p><p>to get the FM,s views first. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Abdullah responded that concern was indeed growing </p><p>over Taliban activities in Afghanistan.  In Ghazni, for </p><p>example, the Taliban had time to establish a network and </p><p>launch concerted operations recently.  This level of </p><p>organization worried Abdullah.  Abdullah noted that Pakistan </p><p>complained about negative perceptions of Pakistan and poor </p><p>Afghan treatment of Pashtuns in Afghanistan.  The FM noted it </p><p>would take time to reverse such feelings, but that this </p><p>process would not be helped by such activities as the Taliban </p><p>and Pakistan were reportedly engaged in.  Abdullah reported </p><p>that security forces in the South were now acting to </p><p>destabilize the region. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) According to Abdullah, President Musharraf had </p><p>complained of Indian covert destabilization activities in </p><p>southern Afghanistan through the Indian consulate in </p><p>Kandahar.  Abdullah,s opinion was that India was unlikely to </p><p>engage in such activity, and had merely established its </p><p>presence to promote its growing (mostly commercial) interests </p><p>in Afghanistan.  India was active in Afghanistan, Abdullah </p><p>noted, including a promised donation of trucks and an offer </p><p>of military training to the ANA, building the Zaranj-Delaram </p><p>road, and a $70m assistance pledge.  Abdullah welcomed </p><p>Pakistan balancing this commitment from their side and </p><p>Pakistan,s involvement in Afghanistan, but rejected any </p><p>notion that Pakistan could &veto8 Indian activities here. </p><p>Abdullah concluded that establishing military and </p><p>intelligence-led trilateral discussions was the best way to </p><p>begin addressing these issues.  The diplomatic channel, he </p><p>added, obliged parties to &take sides8 on these issues. </p><p>Ambassador noted that the diplomatic channel was, however, </p><p>useful as a marker of progress. </p><p> </p><p>=============================== </p><p>A Review f Domestic Conditions </p><p>=============================== </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) SE Khalilzad, acknowledging that domestic issues were </p><p>not the FM,s specific responsibility, then asked FM Abdullah </p><p>for his view on current conditions inside Afghanistan. </p><p>Khalilzad said that there was not as much progress in some </p><p>areas as hoped, including the security sector generally, the </p><p>progress of the national army, establishing a clear DDR </p><p>policy, Ministry of Defense reform towards becoming a </p><p>national organization, and limited progress on NDS (National </p><p>Directorate of Security) reform. </p><p> </p><p>6. (S/NF) Abdullah agreed that there had been less progress </p><p>than hoped for in these areas.  The FM noted that </p><p>misunderstandings between OMC and General Baryalai over </p><p>organizational models for the ANA had caused some delays. </p><p>Abdullah noted that models for ANA organizational </p><p>arrangements must be adapted to fit Afghan circumstances. </p><p>Further, greater levels of support from the local leadership </p><p>was needed to recruit soldiers from Kandahar and Jalalabad, </p><p>which was critical to establishing the required ethnic </p><p>diversity of the ANA.  Turning to DDR, Abdullah noted that </p><p>practical and political considerations were involved in the </p><p>selection of the first effected regions ) early success was </p><p>key to this effort.  An apparent misunderstanding over the </p><p>appropriate numbers of forces involved and whether NDS </p><p>operations would be fully funded by the U.S had also slowed </p><p>reform of NDS.  These NDS issues were now apparently </p><p>resolved, and according to Abdullah, NDS Chief Aref had told </p><p>him reform was ready to move forward. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Abdullah then turned to the controversy over </p><p>appropriate methods of holding the annual celebration </p><p>(&jashn8) of the Mujaheddin victory over the Soviets.  The </p><p>main concern was whether the ANA ) rather than Mujaheddin </p><p>fighters exclusively - would march in this event,s parade. </p><p>Abdullah recommended that the ANA should participate to </p><p>illustrate its role as a national military force.  The </p><p>Ambassador noted he was aware of this issue and said the </p><p>parade should not take place.  He had discussed this with </p><p>President Karzai twice, and told him that an all-Mujaheddin </p><p>event would send the wrong signal at the wrong time ) with </p><p>elections coming up and the constitution being drafted. </p><p>Further, it was a violation of the Bonn Agreement.  The </p><p>Ambassador suggested that a celebration of peace, rather than </p><p>a military event, might be more appropriate.  Abdullah noted </p><p>that last year,s celebrations were &too military8, but </p><p>added that it was not simply a matter of Kabul,s </p><p>celebrations - this event would be celebrated in cities </p><p>throughout Afghanistan.  Ambassador noted that the character </p><p>of the celebration would be a key issue. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Abdullah then turned to Taliban activities in the </p><p>provinces, reporting that they were very focused on the </p><p>provinces.  The Taliban knows what,s happening in Zabol, he </p><p>added, but we do not.  Abdullah also offered his assessment </p><p>on the 2004 elections, reflecting pessimism that the work of </p><p>the Constitutional Commission was proceeding quickly enough. </p><p>SE Khalilzad suggested that the U.S. and Afghan governments </p><p>needed to decide on a set of high priority issues to work on </p><p>closely together.  Khalilzad warned that criticism would grow </p><p>unless progress accelerated, and that a mechanism for </p><p>addressing these priority issues was needed.  Khalilzad asked </p><p>Abdullah for his recommendation of the top two or three items </p><p>which needed to be brought to closure.  Abdullah quickly </p><p>suggested the following priorities: 1) the Constitutional </p><p>Commission, 2) the Election Commission, and 3) ANA/NDS </p><p>reform.  SE Khalilzad shared his concern over the level of </p><p>cooperation from the MOD, noting that MOD reform was key to </p><p>many other areas.  The Ambassador added that we needed to </p><p>stress continued U.S. commitment to remaining engaged in </p><p>Afghanistan and our strong support of reforms.  If such </p><p>reforms happen, we need to continue our support for the </p><p>reformed organizations so that they will not be left </p><p>isolated.  Ambassador added his view that the NDS reform will </p><p>ultimately be successful. </p><p>FINN </p><p></p></div>
