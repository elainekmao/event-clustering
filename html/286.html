<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 ABU DHABI 03092 </p><p> </p><p>E. O. 12356:  DECL:  OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PARM, PINR, IR, UR </p><p>SUBJECT:  POSSIBLE SOVIET ARMS SALES TO IRAN </p><p> </p><p>REF:  STATE 176500 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S - ENTIRE TEXT) </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY.  UAE GOVERNMENT AGREES THAT POSSIBLE </p><p>SOVIET ARMS SALE TO IRAN WOULD BE UNHELPFUL, BUT </p><p>THEY ARE DUBIOUS THAT THEY CAN HAVE MUCH WEIGHT </p><p>IN PREVENTING IT.  MOREOVER, THEY ARE CONCERNED </p><p>ABOUT DRAWING IRANIAN ENMITY.  LINGERING EFFECTS </p><p>OF U.S.-IRAN ARMS SALE SCANDAL AFFECT THEIR </p><p>WILLINGNESS TO RAISE ISSUE WITH SOVIETS.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  IN CONJUNCTION WITH BRIEFINGS ON IRAN BY </p><p>INR/CENTCOM TEAM, AMBASSADOR MADE POINTS IN REFTEL, </p><p>MODIFIED TO ACCOUNT FOR PROBABLE POSTPONEMENT OF </p><p>RAFSANJANI VISIT TO MOSCOW UNTIL AFTER 40-DAY </p><p>MOURNING PERIOD FOR KHOMEINI.  IN TALKS WITH </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL COURT CHAMBERLAIN SHEIKH SUROUR AND </p><p>TOP FOREIGN MINISTRY OFFICIAL IN COUNTRY, </p><p>AMBASSADOR PRESSED VIEW THAT KHOMEINI\'S DEATH </p><p>MAKES ARMS SALES BY SOVIETS OR ANYONE ELSE PARTICU- </p><p>LARLY DESTABILIZING.  AT TIME OF INTERNAL POWER </p><p>STRUGGLE, IT IS ESSENTIAL TO TRY TO FOCUS IRANIAN </p><p>ENERGIES ON ECONOMIC RECONSTRUCTION AND NOT TO </p><p>ENCOURAGE FACTIONS WHICH MAY SEEK WEAPONS WITH </p><p>IDEA OF EVENTUALLY RESUMING WAR WITH IRAQ AND </p><p>ATTACKS ON SHIPPING. </p><p> </p><p>4.  SHEIKH SUROUR LISTENED PATIENTLY BUT WAS </p><p>CLEARLY NOT ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT RAISING THIS ISSUE </p><p>WITH THE SOVIETS.  HE TOOK THE LINE THAT ANY SOVIET </p><p>ARMS IRAN COULD NOW AFFORD WERE UNLIKELY TO BE IN </p><p>SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES TO RECTIFY CURRENT IMBALANCE </p><p>FAVORABLE TO IRAQ.  THUS IT WOULD NOT LEAD TO A </p><p>RESUMPTION OF THE WAR.  AS FOR LONG-TERM SOVIET </p><p>INFLUENCE, HE SAID, IRANIANS WILL NOT BE SUSCEPTIBLE. </p><p>HE CLAIMED THAT IRANIANS ARE BASICALLY PRO-WESTERN </p><p>AND THAT THEIR ECONOMIC INTERESTS ALSO TIE THEM TO </p><p>THE WEST.  SOVIETS, HE THOUGHT, WERE ONLY DOING WHAT </p><p>GREAT POWERS WILL ALWAYS DO --SERVING THEIR INTERESTS. </p><p>IN THIS CASE, HE THOUGHT, IT WOULD BE ONLY OF SHORT- </p><p>TERM SIGNIFICANCE.  IF, HE CHALLENGED, THE U.S. </p><p>ENJOYED GOOD RELATIONS WITH IRAN, AS THE SOVIET </p><p>UNION TEMPORARILY DOES, WOULD IT NOT SELL ARMS TO </p><p>THEM? </p><p> </p><p>5.  WE PRESSED IDEA THAT ARMS SALES COULD INDEED </p><p>BE VERY DESTABILIZING DUE TO CURRENT POLITICAL </p><p>TURMOIL.  THE SALE OF ARMS BY ANY SOURCE --SOVIET </p><p>UNION, CHINA, WESTERN EUROPE STATES, OR FOR THAT </p><p>MATTER THE U.S.-- WOULD SERVE TO ENCOURAGE THE </p><p>ELEMENTS THAT SEEK TO EXPAND THE REVOLUTION AND </p><p>REARM TO RESUME WAR WITH IRAQ.  RESPONSIBLE GOVERN- </p><p>MENTS SHOULD BE DOING ALL THEY CAN TO FOCUS IRANIAN </p><p>ENERGIES ON ECONOMIC RECONSTRUCTION. </p><p> </p><p>6.  DURING OUR CALL ON YACOUB AL-KINDI AT MFA WE </p><p>GOT A MORE RESERVED RESPONSE.  AL-KINDI AGREED THAT </p><p>WE NEEDED TO BE VERY CAUTIOUS BUT THOUGHT IT TOO </p><p>EARLY TO REACH ANY CONCLUSION ABOUT POLICIES </p><p>TOWARD IRAN.  WE SHOULD WATCH TO SEE HOW MATTERS </p><p>DEVELOP.  HE ACCEPTED A NON-PAPER SUMMARIZING </p><p>AMBASSADOR\'S DEMARCHE AND AGREED TO BRIEF FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER RASHID ABDULLA AND UNDERSECRETARY HAMDAN </p><p>BIN ZAYED UPON THEIR RETURNS FROM FOREIGN TRAVEL. </p><p> </p><p>7.  COMMENT:  THE LEGACY OF THE U.S.-IRAN ARMS </p><p>SCANDAL STILL BURDENS OUR DIALOGUE WITH SHEIKH </p><p>SUROUR ON THIS ISSUE.  HE HAD BEEN PERSONALLY </p><p>ACTIVE IN PRESSING THE SOVIET UNION AND CHINA TO </p><p>COOPERATE WITH OPERATION STAUNCH.  IN THE WAKE OF </p><p>IRANGATE REVELATIONS HE FELT POLITICALLY EMBARRASSED </p><p>AND EXPOSED AS AN UNWITTING TOOL OF USG DECEPTION. </p><p>SUROUR HAS NO DOUBT THAT IF THE SOVIET UNION IS </p><p>PERSUADED NOT TO SELL ARMS TO IRAN, IT WILL TELL </p><p>THE IRANIANS IT CANNOT DO SO BECAUSE OF U.S. AND </p><p>ARAB PROTESTS.  MOREOVER, HE VIEWS IRANIAN HEGEMONY </p><p>OVER THE GULF AS A NATURAL STATE OF AFFAIRS.  IN </p><p>THE LONG TERM, HE BELIEVES THAT IRAN WILL RETURN </p><p>TO BOTH SANITY AND STRENGTH AND WILL THEN PLAY A </p><p>STABILIZING ROLE.  IN SHORT, IRAN WILL HELP DEFEND </p><p>THE AREA FROM THE SOVIETS.  IN THE SHORT-TERM, HE </p><p>BELIEVES USG HAS SHOWN IT WILL HELP DEFEND THE GULF </p><p>AGAINST REVOLUTIONARY IRAN.  THAT BEING THE CASE, </p><p>HE APPEARS TO BELIEVE, WHY SHOULD THE U.A.E. RUN </p><p>MORE THAN NECESSARY RISKS WITH IRAN?  FOR NOW, AT </p><p>LEAST, HE PUTS A U.A.E. DEMARCHE TO THE SOVIETS IN </p><p>THE CATEGORY OF UNNECESSARY RISKS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MACK </p><p></p></div>
