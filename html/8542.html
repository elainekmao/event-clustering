<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ADANA 0153 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINS, PGOV, PHUM, TU, IZ, Press Summaries, ADANA </p><p>SUBJECT:  SOUTHEAST TURKEY PRESS SUMMARY, </p><p>          JUNE 06, 2003 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  This is the Southeastern Turkey press summary </p><p>for June 06, 2003.  Please note that Turkish </p><p>press reports often contain errors or </p><p>exaggerations; AmConsulate Adana does not vouch </p><p>for the accuracy of the reports summarized here. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>POLITICAL, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  Cumhuriyet: Egitim-Sen (Teachers\' Union) </p><p>members in Diyarbakir lived through a difficult </p><p>period for twelve years because of applications </p><p>during the State of Emergency Rule. Twenty-seven </p><p>union members fell victim to mysterious killings </p><p>while one hundred ninety six others were deported </p><p>from the region. Egitim-Sen\'s Diyarbakir Chapter </p><p>is going to prepare a report on the problems its </p><p>members and administrators faced during this </p><p>time. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  Turkiye: It is reported that PKK/KADEK has </p><p>decreased the number of its militants in camps in </p><p>Northern Iraq as a precaution against a likely US </p><p>operation against the PKK/KADEK in the region. </p><p>The militants have been scattered from their </p><p>winter camps to a more expanded area in smaller </p><p>groups. It is claimed that the terrorist </p><p>organization has instructed one hundred fifty </p><p>militants in Northern Iraq to infiltrate into </p><p>Turkey from the borders with Iraq, Syria, and </p><p>Iran; and the ones in Turkey have been told to </p><p>move to new bases in rural Bingol and Agri </p><p>provinces. Because it is afraid that the Repent </p><p>Law under consideration would encourage the </p><p>militants to desert from and expedite the </p><p>dissolution in the organization, PKK/KADEK </p><p>instructed its militants it would never abandon </p><p>arms. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  Evrensel: Youth and Women Organizations of </p><p>DEHAP in Diyarbakir, Sanliurfa, Siirt, Adana, and </p><p>Batman provinces announced that the Repent Law on </p><p>the country\'s agenda would deepen the problems, </p><p>and emphasized, instead, a general amnesty, which </p><p>would install peace and order in society, should </p><p>be declared. The security officials in Batman did </p><p>not allow the women\'s organization to make a </p><p>press announcement in front of DEHAP\'s provincial </p><p>office. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  Evrensel: One hundred thirty families evicted </p><p>from Yesilgoz village in Sirnak a number of years </p><p>ago have not been allowed to return to the </p><p>village; they have been kept at the entrance to </p><p>Beytussebab for twenty days on the grounds that </p><p>the village road is closed. The governor had </p><p>earlier given the villagers permission to return </p><p>to their village. A prominent villager, </p><p>Abdurrahman Aslan, said Sirnak Governor, Vehbi </p><p>Avuc, initially told him the reason the villagers </p><p>have been kept in Beytussebab was because there </p><p>was no fuel to open the village road. He said the </p><p>governor later stated Aslan had not obtained his </p><p>permission to return and he would not give such </p><p>permission. When the AK Party district chairman </p><p>suggested his party would buy fuel to open the </p><p>village road if the governor granted permission, </p><p>the governor scolded the party leader not to </p><p>speak nonsense. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ECONOMIC AND AGRICULTURAL DVELOPMENTS </p><p>6.  Milliyet: Welding works of the pipes that </p><p>will carry the Caspian oil via Baku-Tiblisi- </p><p>Ceyhan route started at the exit terminal at </p><p>Botas in Ceyhan. One million barrels of oil will </p><p>be pumped from one thousand seven hundred sixty </p><p>kilometer-long pipeline daily. Turkey will charge </p><p>up to USD 250 million annual transition fee for </p><p>the first 16 years and up to USD 400 million for </p><p>years 16 to 40. </p><p>HOLTZ </p><p></p></div>
