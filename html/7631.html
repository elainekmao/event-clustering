<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 COLOMBO 000707 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR D, P, INR/R/MR, I/RW, I/REC; PA SA/INS (FOR JWALLER) </p><p> </p><p>DEPT ALSO FOR SA/PD (FOR LJIRWIN, LSCENSNY, WREINCKENS); SSA/PAB </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, OPRC, KMDR, OIIP, CE, PTER, EGEN, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  PRESS RELEASE - "US AMBASSADOR\'S REACTION TO LTTE </p><p>SUSPENSION OF PEACE TALKS" </p><p> </p><p>Colombo, April 24, 2003 </p><p> </p><p>Follows is the full text of an interview by Reuters with </p><p>Ambassador Wills on April 24. </p><p> </p><p>Question - What is the U.S. reaction to the Tigers\' pull- </p><p>out from the talks? </p><p> </p><p>Answer - We regret the decisions by the LTTE to suspend its </p><p>participation in the Sri Lankan peace talks and not to </p><p>attend the Tokyo Donors Conference scheduled for June. </p><p> </p><p>We\'ve reviewed carefully the ostensible reasons for these </p><p>decisions cited in Mr. Balasingham\'s letter to the PM.  We </p><p>do not find them convincing.  A well-intentioned party that </p><p>truly wants a peaceful, political settlement to Sri Lanka\'s </p><p>conflict could deal with such grievances at the negotiating </p><p>table.  I\'m not saying I don\'t understand Tamil frustration </p><p>over certain issues, but people must remember that the war </p><p>is not conclusively and officially over.  High-security </p><p>zones, resettlement, development - these are all issues </p><p>that need to be negotiated and dealt with.  But if the LTTE </p><p>wants to represent Tamil interests, it has to participate </p><p>in the negotiations, not walk away from them. </p><p> </p><p>We call on the Tigers to reconsider and to return to the </p><p>negotiating track.  We also call on the LTTE and the </p><p>Government of Sri Lanka to honor the terms of the ceasefire </p><p>even while talks are suspended. </p><p> </p><p>In the meantime, this interregnum in the talks could prove </p><p>useful by giving both parties the opportunity to recommit </p><p>themselves to negotiations.  We have strongly supported the </p><p>ceasefire even though we have also acknowledged it hasn\'t </p><p>been implemented perfectly.  Blame for this does not fall </p><p>exclusively on the side of the Government, however, as the </p><p>LTTE\'s statement suggested.  The Tigers, too, bear heavy </p><p>responsibility for numerous breaches of the ceasefire. </p><p>While the talks are suspended, we urge the LTTE to reflect </p><p>carefully on its own transgressions.  Assassinations of </p><p>opponents, intimidation of Muslims, taxation without </p><p>representation, aggressive Sea Tiger behavior and continued </p><p>child recruitment do not build trust in the LTTE\'s </p><p>intentions. </p><p> </p><p>We continue to believe that the way out of Sri Lanka\'s </p><p>ethnic conflict is through negotiations facilitated by the </p><p>Government of Norway.  And for our part we remain willing </p><p>to do whatever we can to assist Sri Lanka as it tries to </p><p>bring an end to this ugly war. </p><p> </p><p>Question - What about the charge the LTTE makes that Tamils </p><p>are seeing no development, no peace dividend? </p><p> </p><p>Answer - We think that expectations in Sri Lanka - in the </p><p>north and in the south too - are way too high regarding </p><p>economic development.  Patience is in order.  Tamils, </p><p>Sinhalese, indeed all Sri Lankans must understand that </p><p>economic development takes time and unfolds most quickly in </p><p>conditions of lasting peace.  And Sri Lanka doesn\'t yet </p><p>live in conditions of permanent peace.  I don\'t mean to </p><p>sound condescending, but sometimes I get the impression </p><p>that some people in Sri Lanka expect an economic miracle </p><p>now.  Rome wasn\'t built in a day.  Neither will Kilinochi, </p><p>or Trinco, or Hambantota be developed as quickly as we </p><p>would all like. </p><p> </p><p>I obviously don\'t speak for all the donors, but it is my </p><p>impression that many programs are already underway in Sri </p><p>Lanka\'s north and east.  For example, demining, by the U.S. </p><p>and others, is underway and other developmental activities </p><p>are happening as well.  So to allege that nothing is going </p><p>on is unfair.  And to suggest that conditions haven\'t </p><p>improved distorts the truth. </p><p> </p><p>It is also my impression that Sri Lanka\'s friends intend to </p><p>be a lot more generous, and they intend to see that their </p><p>money reaches undeveloped, deserving areas of the north and </p><p>east - because that\'s where the devastation has been </p><p>greatest - but also areas of the south.  Mr. Balasingham\'s </p><p>letter makes it sound like it was only the mismanagement of </p><p>previous Colombo governments that impoverished the south of </p><p>Sri Lanka, and that the devastation of the north and east </p><p>is all Colombo\'s fault.  That\'s ludicrous.  Successive </p><p>governments down here in the south have made many mistakes, </p><p>that\'s certain, but if blame is being distributed fairly, </p><p>the LTTE deserves a great deal as well.  Its pursuit of an </p><p>extreme, separatist agenda, by violent means, has cost Sri </p><p>Lanka\'s north and east, but the rest of Sri Lanka too, </p><p>thousands of lives and 20 years of peaceful development. </p><p>Let us not forget that we need to undo the damage caused by </p><p>some two decades of war and terror and even more years of </p><p>failed economic policies.  That will not be done overnight. </p><p>I should also point out that it is my sense that Sri </p><p>Lanka\'s donors are properly modest about the impact of </p><p>their assistance.  It will be substantial, yes, and in </p><p>certain areas it may be decisive in improving people\'s </p><p>lives.  But we donors know that in general foreign </p><p>assistance can only be catalytic.  The biggest difference </p><p>in economic terms will be made by national and local </p><p>governments\' adopting the right policies.  And in today\'s </p><p>world, my government believes that the right policies are </p><p>those that favor the private sector and individual </p><p>initiative.  Government has its role - in educating people, </p><p>in building infrastructure, in helping the poorest people, </p><p>in protecting individual and property rights - but it is </p><p>Sri Lanka\'s own people, engaged in business dealings with </p><p>one another and with outsiders - who will make this country </p><p>rich. </p><p> </p><p>On this important point, it would be a good thing for the </p><p>LTTE to declare its intentions.  The Sri Lankan Government </p><p>must do a much better job of delivering services and </p><p>assistance.  It\'s way too slow and bureaucratic.  We are </p><p>not blind to the faults of the Colombo Government.  But </p><p>what is the LTTE\'s economic ideology?  Is it going to try </p><p>to control everything?  Is it hoping to pursue autarkic </p><p>policies that isolate the north and east from the rest of </p><p>Sri Lanka? I\'m confident the donors will not agree with </p><p>that.  Or is it going to accept that the best way to help </p><p>the Tamil people is to connect them to the rest of Sri </p><p>Lanka and let their phenomenal talents find expression and </p><p>wealth in a richer,wider context. </p><p> </p><p>Question - You seem pretty skeptical about the LTTE.  What </p><p>can the Tigers do to find acceptance? </p><p> </p><p>Answer - The Tigers want to be treated respectfully and </p><p>seriously.  My government understands that.  But as our </p><p>Deputy Secretary of State, Richard Armitage, said recently, </p><p>we can see a legitimate political role for the LTTE </p><p>provided it renounces terrorism and violence.  The time for </p><p>fighting has long since passed.  The LTTE\'s leadership </p><p>likes to portray itself as brave . . . well, a truly </p><p>courageous thing would be for that leadership to give up </p><p>violence and even the threat of violence and push for a </p><p>permanent peace now. </p><p> </p><p>I\'ve heard Tamils say that they may not like the LTTE\'s </p><p>tactics but they need the Tigers to protect them.  I think </p><p>that\'s completely wrong.  The outlines of a settlement have </p><p>been pretty clear for years, at least since the mid-90\'s. </p><p>Some sort of devolution of power that gives Sri Lanka\'s </p><p>north and east - merged or not - considerable autonomy is </p><p>in order.  Call it internal self-determination if you like. </p><p>Call it federalism if you like.  But Sri Lanka should </p><p>remain united.  And be diverse and democratic.  Local </p><p>governments likely will matter more than they do now. </p><p>That\'s the best way to protect Tamil and Sinhala and Muslim </p><p>rights and, most of all, individual rights.  The LTTE\'s </p><p>weapons and armed cadre aren\'t protecting Tamil rights; </p><p>they\'re prolonging this conflict and delaying the day when </p><p>Tamils can live in truly peaceful conditions.  And now that </p><p>the world is paying attention to Sri Lanka as never before, </p><p>the international community will be watching closely to see </p><p>that no one\'s rights get abused systematically once a final </p><p>settlement is done. </p><p> </p><p>If the LTTE wants respect, it should accept this and engage </p><p>the Government to settle on the terms for a new Sri Lanka. </p><p>It should not pull out of the talks.  And it should go to </p><p>Tokyo.  It doesn\'t want to miss this opportunity to </p><p>represent the Tamil people, to be identified with the </p><p>decisions that are coming that will apportion donor money. </p><p>If Tamils are leery of Colombo-based governments, if they </p><p>fear that they will be double-crossed - and I can </p><p>understand why some Tamils would have such apprehensions - </p><p>then the LTTE should be engaging, not suspending.  If the </p><p>LTTE makes positive moves, my government will acknowledge </p><p>them and respond.  But a truly warm American and </p><p>international reaction can only come when the LTTE </p><p>renounces terrorism and violence. </p><p> </p><p>The Tigers\'s goal should be to make peace, and quickly. </p><p>Too much blood has been spilled, too many opportunities for </p><p>forgiveness missed.  If I may quote an Indian politician: </p><p>"It\'s impossible to shake hands with a clenched fist."  And </p><p>I might add that it\'s hard to shake hands with one\'s back </p><p>turned. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
