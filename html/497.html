<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 BOGOTA 02165 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SOUTHCOM ALSO FOR POLAD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PINS, PGOV, PINR, KPRP, CO </p><p>SUBJECT:  COLOMBIAN COMMUNISTS WANT TO TAKE OVER FARC </p><p> </p><p>REF:  BOGOTA 1956 </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL -- ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  ROBERTO SAENZ VARGAS, YOUNGER BROTHER OF </p><p>FARC LEADER ALFONSO CANO (NOM DE GUERRE OF GUILLERMO </p><p>LEON SAENZ VARGAS), AND FARC GO-BETWEEN MORRIS </p><p>ACKERMAN SEPARATELY HAVE TOLD POLOFF THAT HARDLINERS </p><p>WHO NOW CONTROL THE COLOMBIAN COMMUNIST PARTY (PCC), </p><p>HAVE DETERMINED TO WORK TO TAKE CONTROL OF THE </p><p>COLOMBIAN REVOLUTIONARY ARMED FORCES (FARC) INSURGENT </p><p>GROUP AS WELL AS GUERRILLA PEACE TALKS WITH THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT.  THE PCC\'S FIVE-MEMBER SECRETARIAT WOULD </p><p>REPLACE THE FARC\'S, AND AS DID SALVADORAN PARTY CHIEF </p><p>SCHAFIK HANDAL, PCC GENERAL SECRETARY ALVARO VASQUEZ </p><p>DEL REAL WOULD HEAD THE GUERRILLA NEGOTIATING TEAM. </p><p>IN OUR VIEW, FARC HEAD MANUEL MARULANDA VELEZ WOULD </p><p>ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN "ONLY OVER HIS DEAD BODY."  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>COMMUNISM\'S COLLAPSE HAS ONLY SERVED TO HARDEN PCC </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p>3.  RECENT CHANGES IN COLOMBIA AND THE REST OF THE </p><p>WORLD, INCLUDING THE COLLAPSE OF COMMUNISM </p><p>INTERNATIONALLY, ACCORDING TO ACKERMAN, HAVE ONLY </p><p>HARDENED THE ORTHODOX COLOMBIAN PARTY\'S RESOLVE IN </p><p>FAVOR OF PROLONGED CAMPESINO-BASED ARMED STRUGGLE </p><p>(THROUGH THE FARC).  SAENZ, WHO QUIT THE PARTY IN </p><p>NOVEMBER, CALLED THE PCC "THE ONLY COMMUNIST PARTY IN </p><p>THE WORLD THAT HASN\'T CHANGED."  ACCORDING TO SAENZ </p><p>AND ACKERMAN, THE PCC\'S DECISION TO TAKE OVER THE FARC </p><p>STEMS PARTIALLY FROM ITS DISSATISFACTION WITH THE </p><p>GUERRILLAS\' CONDUCT OF THE NEGOTIATIONS (NOW RECESSED) </p><p>WITH THE GOVERNMENT.  THE PCC IS NOT HAPPY THAT UNDER </p><p>CANO, THE CHIEF GUERRILLA NEGOTIATOR, THE TALKS WERE </p><p>ALLOWED TO DRIFT INTO NOTHING MORE THAN NEGOTIATIONS </p><p>FOR A CEASE FIRE (IN WHICH THE PCC HAS NO INTEREST), </p><p>AND ACCOMPLISHED FEW OF THE GUERRILLAS\' AND THE PCC\'S </p><p>POLITICAL OBJECTIVES. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REYES AND CHACON:  MR. INSIDE AND MR. OUTSIDE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>4.  TWO PERSONS EXPECTED TO PLAY KEY ROLES IN THE </p><p>PARTY\'S EFFORTS TO TAKE OVER THE INSURGENCY ARE FARC </p><p>SECRETARIAT MEMBER RAUL REYES, LONG "THE PARTY\'S MAN" </p><p>IN THE FARC\'S FIVE-MEMBER DIRECTORATE, AND PCC </p><p>ORGANIZATION SECRETARY AND SECRETARIAT MEMBER MILLER </p><p>CHACON (NOM DE GUERRE: "MISAEL").  ACKERMAN SAID THAT </p><p>EACH DAY SOMEONE FROM THE PCC\'S SECRETARIAT TRAVELS TO </p><p>VISIT THE FARC\'S.  THE PCC IS AFRAID TO LEAVE THE </p><p>FARC\'S HIERARCHY ALONE FOR EVEN A MINUTE, ACKERMAN SAID. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>WILL ANYONE IN FARC TOP BRASS STOP THE PARTY? </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>5.  OF THE FARC\'S FIVE SECRETARIAT MEMBERS, ACKERMAN </p><p>SAID THE PCC HOPES TO WIN OVER FARC HEAD MANUEL </p><p>MARULANDA VELEZ (AKA "TIROFIJO"); THAT WOULD INSURE </p><p>THE ACQUIESCENCE OF TIMOLEON JIMENEZ, TIROFIJO\'S </p><p>PROTEGE.  THE PPC ALSO HOPES TO SET CANO AND IVAN </p><p>MARQUEZ AGAINST ONE ANOTHER, NEUTRALIZING BOTH.  RAUL </p><p>REYES ALREADY IS FIRMLY IN THE PARTY\'S CAMP.  WHILE </p><p>ACKERMAN SAW TIROFIJO ("MORE A GUERRILLA THAN A </p><p>COMMUNIST") AS THE MAIN OBSTACLE TO THE REALIZATION OF </p><p>THE PARTY\'S GOAL, SAENZ DIDN\'T THINK ANYONE INSIDE THE </p><p>FARC SECRETARIAT, ALL PARTY MEMBERS, POSED A PROBLEM. </p><p>SAENZ SAID THAT MORE OF A HINDRANCE WAS THE PCC\'S OWN </p><p>SECRETARIAT, NOT ALL OF WHOM AGREE ON TAKING DIRECT </p><p>CONTROL OF THE INSURGENCY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>THE FARC IS ALL THE PARTY HAS LEFT </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>6.  SAENZ AND ACKERMAN AGREED THAT ANOTHER PCC </p><p>MOTIVATION WAS THE DETERIORATION OF ITS INFLUENCE OVER </p><p>OTHER, MOSTLY URBAN SECTORS OF COLOMBIAN SOCIETY, </p><p>INCLUDING TRADE UNION (E.G., CUT, AND THE PETROLEUM </p><p>WORKERS\' USO) AND ARTISTIC MOVEMENTS (E.G., THEATER </p><p>AND WRITERS GROUPS).  FOR THE PCC, SAENZ SAID, "ONLY </p><p>THE FARC REMAINS."  SAENZ SAID THE FARC CONTINUES TO </p><p>HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF RURAL SUPPORT, SOME THROUGH </p><p>INTIMIDATION. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CANO AND OTHER \'80S HOPEFULS:  PARTY\'S LOST GENERATION </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p>7.  THE PARTY IN THE 1980S SENT SEVERAL BRIGHT, YOUNG </p><p>ACTIVISTS TO THE FARC OSTENSIBLY TO PROVIDE THE </p><p>CAMPESINO MOVEMENT WITH POLITICAL ADVICE.  THEIR </p><p>ACTUAL OBJECTIVE WAS TO EXTEND THE PARTY\'S INFLUENCE </p><p>OVER THE INSURGENCY, AS THE PARTY EARLIER HAD DONE </p><p>WITH JACOBO ARENAS, WHO HEADED THE FARC UNTIL HIS </p><p>AUGUST 1990 DEATH FROM A HEART ATTACK. </p><p> </p><p>8.  THE BEST AND BRIGHTEST OF THE 1980S CROP WAS </p><p>ALFONSO CANO, OVER WHOM THE PCC REALIZES IT HAS LOST </p><p>CONTROL.  HE\'S NOT THE ONLY ONE.  SAENZ SAID THE </p><p>DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE OF BEING A GUERRILLA CHANGED THE </p><p>YOUNG TURKS.  MANY, ACCORDING TO ACKERMAN, UPON </p><p>STRAPPING A GUN ON THEIR HIP AND GAINING SOME </p><p>INDIVIDUAL POWER, NOT TO MENTION THE MONEY FROM THE </p><p>GUERRILLAS\' LUCRATIVE ACTIVITIES, BEGAN TO FEEL THEY </p><p>DIDN\'T HAVE TO TAKE ORDERS ANYMORE FROM PARTY LEADERS </p><p>IN BOGOTA.  IT IS PARTIALLY BECAUSE OF FAILURE OF THE </p><p>PREVIOUS EFFORTS TO INFLUENCE THE FARC THAT THE PARTY </p><p>NOW WANTS TO TAKE FULL CONTROL OF THE GUERRILLA GROUP. </p><p> </p><p>9.  ACCORDING TO SAENZ, THE PROBLEM FOR THE PARTY IS </p><p>DEEPER.  ACCUSING PARTY LEADERS WHO HAVE NEVER RUN FOR </p><p>PUBLIC OFFICE OF BEING DETACHED FROM "THE REAL WORLD," </p><p>SAENZ, A FORMER CITY COUNCIL ALTERNATE AND </p><p>UNSUCCESSFUL HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES CANDIDATE, SAID </p><p>BEING A GUERRILLA LEADER OR AN ELECTED OFFICIAL IS FAR </p><p>DIFFERENT FROM BEING A PCC LEADER.  "YOU BECOME AWARE </p><p>OF REAL PEOPLES\' CONCERNS, AND IT CHANGES YOU."  IT </p><p>CHANGED SCHAFIK HANDAL AND THE SALVADORAN PARTY, SAENZ </p><p>SAID, AND IT WOULD CHANGE THE PCC. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PARTY TAKEOVER WOULD EXPOSE THE FARC FOR WHAT IT IS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>10.  FOR THAT REASON, SAENZ, DISAGREEING WITH </p><p>ACKERMAN, THOUGHT IT WOULD BENEFIT THE PEACE PROCESS </p><p>FOR THE PARTY TO TAKE OVER THE FARC AND THE TALKS. </p><p>BESIDES, SAENZ SAID, SUCH A TAKEOVER WOULD REVEAL TO </p><p>THE PUBLIC THE DECADES-LONG LINK BETWEEN THE PCC AND </p><p>FARC, EXPOSING TO THE FARC\'S RURAL SUPPORTERS THAT ITS </p><p>AGENDA IS THE SAME COMMUNIST ONE DISCREDITED </p><p>WORLDWIDE.  SAENZ WOULD THEREFORE LIKE THE PCC TO </p><p>COMPETE OPENLY IN ELECTIONS INSTEAD OF THROUGH ITS </p><p>ELECTORAL FRONT, THE PATRIOTIC UNION (UP). </p><p> </p><p>11.  COMMENT:  BASED ON WHAT MOST SOURCES HAVE SAID </p><p>ABOUT TIROFIJO, ALTHOUGH A LOYAL PARTY MEMBER, WE </p><p>BELIEVE "ONLY OVER HIS DEAD BODY" WOULD HE LET ANYONE, </p><p>EVEN THE PCC, TAKE OVER "HIS" MOVEMENT.  FOR THAT </p><p>REASON, THE PARTY\'S GOAL OF TAKING OVER THE FARC HAS </p><p>TO BE VIEWED AS A LONG-TERM PROJECT, WITH THE </p><p> </p><p>POSSIBILITY OF BEING REALIZED ONLY AFTER TIROFIJO (IN </p><p>HIS 60S) PASSES FROM THE SCENE.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BUSBY </p><p></p></div>
