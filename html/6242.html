<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 001426 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/10/2008 </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, KU, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: KUWAITI FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO JORDAN </p><p> </p><p>REF: AMMAN 1412 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMBASSADOR EDWARD W. GNEHM.  REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (c)  Further to phone and email conversations between </p><p>Ambassadors Jones and Gnehm, a March 10 meeting between the </p><p>Ambassador and Prime Minister shed some light on the apparent </p><p>misunderstanding between the Kuwaitis and Jordanians over the </p><p>$100 million Kuwait had offered to deposit in the Jordanian </p><p>central bank.  PM Abul Ragheb showed the Ambassador a letter </p><p>from the director of the Kuwait Investment Authority offering </p><p>to make such a deposit on behalf of the Kuwaiti government </p><p>and setting the financial conditions, including a one year </p><p>term for the deposit and an interest rate at 1.75 percentage </p><p>points over LIBOR. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (c)  The Prime Minister said that since such conditions </p><p>amounted to a commercial debt that Jordan would have to pay </p><p>back quickly, he would not have the ability to freely use the </p><p>money.  Thus, he had not authorized acceptance of the </p><p>deposit.  He said he instructed Foreign Minister Muasher, who </p><p>is currently visiting Kuwait (reftel), to ask that the </p><p>deposit be turned into a grant or a long-term loan at </p><p>concessional interest rates (he said 25 years at 0.25% </p><p>interest).  We should know more when Muasher returns to Amman. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
