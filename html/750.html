SARINIC COMPLAINED THAT THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>COMMUNITY\'S FOCUS ON GAINING RECOGNITION OF BOSNIAN </p><p>HERZEGOVINA WAS POINTLESS, AND CREATED A "DANGEROUS" </p><p>SITUATION IN CROATIA.  AMBASSADOR GALBRAITH URGED THE GOC </p><p>TO OPEN A "SECOND TRACK" OF NEGOTIATIONS:  TO HOLD TALKS </p><p>WITH SERBS FROM GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED TERRITORY ON HOW TO </p><p>IMPROVE THE OVERALL STATUS OF SERBS IN CROATIA.

AT LUNCH ON JUNE 30, PRESIDENTIAL CHIEF OF STAFF HRVOJE </p><p>SARINIC TOLD AMBASSADOR GALBRAITH THAT THE GOC WAS WILLING </p><p>TO BEGIN NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE KNIN SERBS.  SARINIC, </p><p>SAYING HE WAS REPEATING A STATEMENT HE MADE TO UN SRSG </p><p>AKASHI, SAID "THE ONLY PRECONDITION IS THAT THERE BE NO </p><p>PRECONDITIONS."  HE NOTED IN PARTICULAR THAT SERB </p><p>PRECONDITIONS, SUCH AS A CROATIAN WITHDRAWAL FROM MOUNT </p><p>DINARA IN SECTOR SOUTH, WERE NOT CONSTRUCTIVE.  NOTING </p><p>THAT THE EU AMBASSADORS HAD PRESENTED A DEMARCHE URGING </p><p>WITHDRAWAL FROM MOUNT DINARA, SARINIC SAID THE GOC OFFERED </p><p>"NO APOLOGIES" FOR THE SITUATION:  FOR A LONG TIME, THE </p><p>SITUATION FOR CROATIA HAD BEEN "VERY BAD," NOW IT WAS ONLY </p><p>CROATIAN MILITARY STEPS WHICH HAD MADE THINGS "A BIT </p><p>BETTER." </p><p> </p><p>4. SARINIC HEDGED THE GOC\'S LACK OF PRECONDITIONS ON </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS.  THE GOC "OBVIOUSLY" WAS NOT PREPARED TO </p><p>NEGOTIATE WITH "RSK PRESIDENT" MARTIC.  SARINIC ALSO </p><p>CLAIMED THE GOC WAS STILL WILLING TO MEET IN GENEVA, BUT </p><p>THAT THIS "FLEXIBILITY" WOULD "NOT LAST LONG."  TUDJMAN </p><p>WAS AGAINST HOLDING THE MEETING IN GENEVA, AND "SOON" THE </p><p>GOC WOULD RETURN TO ITS INSISTENCE THAT THE NEGOTIATIONS </p><p>BE HELD IN CROATIA. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>TUDJMAN:  BUT ONLY UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  02493  01 OF 03  031643Z </p><p> </p><p>5. "SOON" ARRIVED EARLIER THAN EVEN SARINIC HAD EXPECTED. </p><p>ON JULY 2, PRESIDENT TUDJMAN TOLD ICFY CO-CHAIRMEN BILDT </p><p>AND STOLTENBERG THAT CROATIA WOULD SEEK PRECONDITIONS TO </p><p>ANY NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE KNIN SERBS.  UNDER THE HEADLINE </p><p>"THREE PRECONDITIONS FOR TALKS" THE GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED </p><p>DAILY "VJESNIK" REPORTED SIX (BY OUR COUNT) CONDITIONS: 1) </p><p>THAT MILAN MARTIC NOT PARTICIPATE, AS HE WAS A "WAR </p><p>CRIMINAL" WHO ORDERED THE MAY 2-3 SHELLING OF ZAGREB; 2) </p><p>THAT THE TALKS BE HELD "ON THE TERRITORY OF CROATIA;" 3) </p><p>THAT ANY POLITICAL NEGOTIATIONS WHICH MIGHT TAKE PLACE </p><p>MUST "SUBMIT TO THE SPIRIT OF THE CROATIAN CONSTITUTIONAL </p><p>ACT ON MINORITIES AND ETHNIC COMMUNITIES;" 4) THE RIJEKA- </p><p>SISAK OIL PIPELINE BE REOPENED, AS AGREED IN THE DECEMBER </p><p>1994 ECONOMIC AND CONFIDENCE-BUILDING MEASURES AGREEMENT </p><p>(ECBMA); 5) THE EU ASSIST IN OPENING OF THE ZAGREB-KNIN- </p><p>SPLIT RAILWAY; AND 6) THE UNCRO MANDATE BE IMPLEMENTED "A </p><p>S </p><p>ENVISAGED IN THE UN RESOLUTIONS."  (NOTE:  THE PRESS </p><p>RELEASE FROM TUDJMAN\'S OFFICE SOUGHT TO PORTRAY ONLY THE </p><p>LATTER THREE DEMANDS AS GOC "PRECONDITIONS."

COMMENT:  TUDJMAN\'S CONDITIONS, IF HELD TO STRICTLY, </p><p>MEAN WEEKS MORE OF PRE-NEGOTIATIONS BEFORE ANY REAL TALKS </p><p>CAN GET UNDER WAY.  THE PRESS ACCOUNT REPORTED THAT </p><p>TUDJMAN AND THE ICFY CO-CHAIRMEN "AGREED TO ARRANGE </p><p>INTRODUCTORY TALKS IN GENEVA TO DECIDE THE AGENDA AND THE </p><p>TERMS OF FUTURE NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE CROATIAN SERBS.

SARINIC NOTED THAT IT WAS HARD TO BE SURE WHO AMONG THE </p><p>KRAJINA SERBS STILL HAD AUTHORITY, AND URGED THAT MORE </p><p>PRESSURE BE PLACED ON MILOSEVIC.  SARINIC CLAIMED THAT </p><p>MILOSEVIC HAD "GOOD RELATIONS" WITH "RSK PRIME MINISTER- </p><p>DESIGNATE" MILAN BABIC, AND HAD IN FACT ENGINEERED </p><p>BORISLAV MIKELIC\'S OUSTER WHEN MIKELIC BECAME INEFFECTIVE. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  02493  02 OF 03  031643Z </p><p>(COMMENT:  SARINIC OFFERED NO EVIDENCE FOR THIS CLAIM. END </p><p>COMMENT.)  WHEN THE AMBASSADOR ASKED IF THE GOC WAS </p><p>PREPARED TO TAKE MILITARY ACTION, PRESUMABLY AT THE END OF </p><p>THE CURRENT UN MANDATE, SARINIC GAVE A SOMEWHAT DESULTORY </p><p>"YEAH" BUT THEN NOTED THAT SEVERAL MONTHS STILL REMAINED </p><p>AND EXCLAIMED, "MAKE SOMETHING HAPPEN!" </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>BUT DON\'T IGNORE CROATIA </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>8. BUT THE CURRENT APPROACH WAS "DANGEROUS," SARINIC SAID, </p><p>BECAUSE CROATIA WAS AGAIN ON THE BACK BURNER FOR THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.  COMMENTING ON THE EU\'S CANNES </p><p>STATEMENT, SARINIC ARGUED THAT RECOGNITION OF CROATIA AND </p><p>BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA BY THE "FRY" SHOULD BE A PACKAGE.  THE </p><p>U.S. HAD SEEMED TO BELIEVE THIS, SARINIC SAID, "BUT THEN </p><p>MR. FRASURE MADE HIS TRIPS TO BELGRADE."  RECOGNITION OF </p><p>B-H BY MILOSEVIC "WILL CHANGE NOTHING," WHEREAS </p><p>RECOGNITION OF CROATIA COULD ACTUALLY PAY REAL DIVIDENDS. </p><p>THE AMBASSADOR TOLD SARINIC THAT THE SANCTIONS PACKAGE </p><p>PRESENTED TO MILOSEVIC STILL SOMETHING IN RESERVE LINKED </p><p>TO RECOGNITION OF CROATIA.  BUT SARINIC AGAIN NOTED THAT </p><p>CROATIA HAD SUNK INTO "THE SECOND LINE" AGAIN, AND </p><p>COMMENTED THAT MANY IN THE GOC DREW THE LESSON THAT "WE </p><p>ONLY SEE POLITICAL ATTENTION WHEN THERE ARE HOSTILITIES." </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p>PUSHING FOR A "SECOND TRACK": TALK TO YOUR "LOYAL" SERBS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  02493  02 OF 03  031643Z </p><p>9. OBSERVING THAT WE HAD NO REAL CAUSE FOR OPTIMISM OVER </p><p>THE PROSPECTS FOR ZAGREB-KNIN TALKS, THE AMBASSADOR URGED </p><p>SARINIC TO PURSUE A "SECOND TRACK" OF DISCUSSIONS: WITH </p><p>THE SERBIAN COMMUNITY ON CROATIAN GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED </p><p>TERRITORY.  THIS INCLUDED SERBS WHO HAD STAYED IN CITIES </p><p>SUCH AS ZAGREB OR RIJEKA THROUGHOUT THE WAR, BUT ALSO </p><p>THOSE SERBS WHO REMAINED IN, OR RETURNED TO, THEIR HOMES </p><p>IN WESTERN SLAVONIA (SECTOR WEST).  MANY STEPS COULD BE </p><p>TAKEN SUCH AS: REBUILDING SERB AS WELL AS CROAT HOMES </p><p>DAMAGED DURING THE WAR, TAKING STEPS AGAINST EMPLOYMENT </p><p>DISCRIMINATION, GIVING THE SERBS MORE OF A VOICE IN </p><p>CURRICULUM DECISIONS, AND PUNISHING ANY CROATIANS WHO MAY </p><p>HAVE COMMITTED CRIMES AGAINST SERBS IN THE AFTERMATH OF </p><p>OPERATION "FLASH."  BUT THIS WERE JUST SOME IDEAS, PERHAPS </p><p>EVEN MORE IMPORTANT WOULD BE TO BEGAN A PUBLIC, AND </p><p>OFFICIAL, DIALOGUE WITH SERB COMMUNITY LEADERS, SO THAT </p><p>THEY FELT THEY HAD AN INFLUENCE ON THE DECISIONS TAKEN BY </p><p>THE GOC.  RIGHT NOW, THE AMBASSADOR NOTED, THE SERBS OF </p><p>CROATIA FEEL SHUT OUT FROM DECISION-MAKING, EVEN ON THE </p><p>ISSUES OF GREATEST CONSEQUENCE TO THEM.  THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>ALSO NOTED THAT PUBLIC STEPS TO IMPROVE AND SECURE THE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NNNNPTQ4974 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ4974 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  02493  03 OF 03  031644Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-01 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   CIAE-00  SMEC-00  OASY-00  SRPP-00  FBIE-00 </p><p>      H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-08    L-01     ADS-00   M-00 </p><p>      NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   PA-01    PM-00    PRS-01   P-01 </p><p>      SCT-00   SP-00    SSO-00   SS-00    TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00 </p><p>      PMB-00   PRMC-01  DRL-09   G-00       /027W </p><p>                  ------------------D5EAF6  031644Z /38 </p><p>O 031739Z JUL 95 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 6287 </p><p>INFO USMISSION USUN NEW YORK IMMEDIATE </p><p>NATO EU COLLECTIVE </p><p>WHITE HOUSE WASHDC </p><p>AMEMBASSY LJUBLJANA </p><p>JOINT STAFF WASHDC//J-5PMA/J21// </p><p>SECDEF WASHDC//ISA/ISP// </p><p>AMEMBASSY BUDAPEST </p><p>CINCUSAFE RAMSTEIN AB GE//DO/LG/XOX/IN/POLAD// </p><p>DIA WASHDC </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA </p><p>CINCUSAREUR HEIDELBERG GE//J3/J4/J5/POLAD// </p><p>AMCONSUL MUNICH </p><p>AMEMBASSY BELGRADE </p><p>JAC MOLESWORTH RAF MOLESWORTH UK </p><p>HQ JTF PP NAPLES IT//CA/POLAD// </p><p>COMSIXTHFLT //N2// </p><p>USCINCEUR VAIHINGEN GE//ECJ3/ECJ4/ECJ5/ECPOLAD// </p><p>USLO SKOPJE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  02493  03 OF 03  031644Z </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 ZAGREB 002493 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BRUSSELS ALSO FOR USEU </p><p>USVIENNA ALSO FOR USDEL CSCE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: 7/3/05 </p><p>TAGS:  PREL PGOV HR UN </p><p>SUBJECT:  PRESIDENTIAL CHIEF OF STAFF ON 6/30 SAYS "NO </p><p>          PRECONDITIONS" FOR NEGOTIATIONS; TUDJMAN ON 7/2 </p><p>          GIVES ICFY A LIST OF PRECONDITIONS </p><p> </p><p>STATUS OF ETHNIC SERB CITIZENS COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT </p><p>IMPACT WITH THE POPULATION OF THE "RSK" IN TERMS OF </p><p>REDUCING SUPPORT FOR THE REBEL REGIME, AND WOULD ALMOST </p><p>CERTAINLY HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT ON CROATIA\'S RELATIONS </p><p>WITH THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. </p><p> </p><p>10. SARINIC\'S REACTION WAS COOL, BUT NOT NEGATIVE.  NO ONE </p><p>FROM THE SERB COMMUNITY HAD APPROACHED HIM WITH A FORMAL </p><p>REQUEST FOR A MEETI </p><p>NG.  IF HE RECEIVED ONE, HE WOULD </p><p>"CATALYZE" IT, AND PERHAPS EVEN PARTICIPATE HIMSELF. </p><p>SARINIC ARGUED THAT THE GOC HAD "TRIED ITS BEST" TO SHOW </p><p>SERBS IN WESTERN SLAVONIA THAT LIFE IN CROATIA WAS </p><p>POSSIBLE, AND REPEATED THAT THE GOC WAS READY TO RECEIVE </p><p>ALL SERBS WHO WANTED TO RETURN.  THE GOC HAD PROBLEMS, </p><p>HOWEVER, WITH "LOCAL PEOPLE" WHO RESIST THE GOC\'S </p><p>DECISIONS.  ACCORDING TO SARINIC, "DECISIONS TAKEN AT THE </p><p>HIGHEST LEVEL ARE NOT IMPLEMENTED LOCALLY.

COMMENT:  THE REALITY OF RESISTANCE AMONG MANY (BUT </p><p>NOT ALL) OF THE DISPLACED PERSONS, WAR VETERANS, AND EVEN </p><p>AVERAGE CROATIANS FOR FULL PROTECTION OF THE HUMAN AND </p><p>CIVIL RIGHTS OF THE SERB COMMUNITY IS PRECISELY WHY THE </p><p>GOC MUST TAKE AN ACTIVIST APPROACH ON THE ISSUE.  WE PLAN </p><p>TO CONTINUE TO PUSH THE GOC TO BEGIN A PROCESS OF DIALOGUE </p><p>(UNDER MODIFIED Z-4 AUSPICES) WITH THE "LOYAL" SERB </p><p>COMMUNITY AS A "SECOND TRACK" WHICH CAN BE FOLLOWED IN </p><p>PARALLEL TO, BUT INDEPENDENT OF, THE NORMAL Z-4 </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS WITH KNIN. </p><p> </p><p>GALBRAITH </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p></p></div>
