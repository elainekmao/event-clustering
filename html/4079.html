Reasons 1.5(b) and </p><p>(d). </p><p> </p><p> 1. (C) SUMMARY: Ambassador and Political Officer visited </p><p>Midlands province October 17 and 18 to meet with USAID, CDC, </p><p>and WFP beneficiaries, NGO and UN staff, and GOZ officials. </p><p>Against the backdrop of the HIV/AIDS, land, and food crises </p><p>gripping the country, Midlands province seems to be the model </p><p>of moderation and cooperation.  Government, community, </p><p>business, and NGO leaders are working together to tackle the </p><p>HIV/AIDS and food issues in a relatively peaceful and orderly </p><p>manner.  The visit to Midlands also illustrated the internal </p><p>contradictions in the Zanu-PF leadership and the enourmous </p><p>pressures on those who would take a moderate course. END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>MIDLANDS: THE MODEL IN LAND REDISTRIBUTION </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>2. (U) Ambassador and Political Officer visited Midlands </p><p>province October 17 and 18 to meet with USAID, CDC, and WFP </p><p>beneficiaries, NGO and UN staff, and GOZ officials.  The </p><p>overarching concerns of the people we met were the HIV/AIDS </p><p>and food security crises.  (NOTE: Midlands has been held up </p><p>as the model province in the government land redistribution </p><p>exercise.  On the morning of October 17, BBC Radio </p><p>interviewed a white, commercial and newly resettled, black </p><p>farmer in a highly favorable report on the land </p><p>redistribution in Midlands.  A few weeks prior to our visit, </p><p>the GOZ showed off the land redistribution in theis province </p><p>to a group of African Ambassadors. END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) In a meeting with Cephas Msipa, provincial governor of </p><p>Midlands, Ambassador and PolOff learned about his efforts at </p><p>land redistribution in his province.  Msipa said unlike some </p><p>of his colleagues, he was resisting the call to take more </p><p>land from the whites and that he personally had taken far </p><p>less land himself than the law allowed.  He also added that </p><p>he had sought to resolve land disputes amicably and that the </p><p>land exercise in Midlands had brought blacks and whites </p><p>together and forced them to get to know one another.  In </p><p>fact, the white farmers in Midlands were helping the newly </p><p>resettled farmers with their crops to minimize the reduction </p><p>in crop production. The Ambassador asked if lack of seeds or </p><p>the cost of seeds would be a problem for next season,s </p><p>agricultural production to which Msipa replied that inputs in </p><p>general would be a problem.  Communities were pooling their </p><p>resources to buy seeds so seed acquisition was not a problem. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Msipa claimed that his, along with Vice President </p><p>Joseph Msika, Social Welfare Minister July Moyo, also the </p><p>ZANU-PF Chairman for Midlands, and Speaker of Parliament </p><p>Emmerson Mnangagwa, who is from the Midlands, was the voice </p><p>of moderation regarding the land issue among the party elite. </p><p> (See REFTEL for Mnangagwa,s comments on land redistribution </p><p>in Midlands.) Msipa said he had successfully stopped the </p><p>acquisition of the dairy farms, arguing that to seize the </p><p>farms would adversely affect milk production.  (NOTE: There </p><p>is currently a milk shortage in the country.  END NOTE.)  He </p><p>also claimed to have convinced national authorities to delist </p><p>a successful game lodge in Midlands, although the owners have </p><p>not received confirmation of this. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Governor Msipa said that Zimbabwe\'s political impasse </p><p>was profound.  ZANU-PF leaders recognized that President </p><p>Mugabe needed to retire, but were anxious that a ZANU-PF </p><p>succession be secured.  He sharply criticized Ministers </p><p>Jonathan Moyo and Ignatius Chombo, ministers of information </p><p>and local government respectively, and cited a &wildcat8 </p><p>committee promoted by Chombo, which had visited Midlands and </p><p>sought to force nature conservancy owners off their land in </p><p>contradiction to national policy on nature conservancies </p><p>recently agreed by Vice President Msika and Tourism Minister </p><p>Francis Nhema.  Governor Msipa said he had intervened to </p><p>expel this committee and get the necessary political backing </p><p>for his position.  Regarding the MDC, Msipa claimed he had </p><p>been generally able to ensure amicable dealings with the MDC, </p><p>although Mberengwa MDC activist Sekai Holland was a difficult </p><p>character. (COMMENT: We agree with his characterization of </p><p>Holland. END COMMENT.) He claimed that MDC was running real </p><p>risks if it embarked on adventurous courses like mass action, </p><p>given its likely penetration by the Central Intelligence </p><p>Organization (CIO). </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>FOOD INSECURITY WIDESPREAD </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>6. (C) Msipa was very concerned about the food situation and </p><p>dismayed at the level of obstructionism by his government. He </p><p>said that even though politicization of food aid is not </p><p>tolerated at the higher levels of government, he knew it was </p><p>happening on the ground and was visibly disturbed by this </p><p>fact.  Msipa seemed excited that we were traveling to his </p><p>home district of Zvishavane (we met in the provincial </p><p>capital, Gweru) to look at food distribution and asked that </p><p>we meet again upon our return to exchange notes. He was </p><p>anxious to find out if CARE, one of World Food Program,s </p><p>implementing partners, had enough food to distribute and how </p><p>things were going.  (NOTE: Zvishavane is one of the most food </p><p>insecure districts in Zimbabwe.  END NOTE.)  Msipa said he </p><p>was trying to secure additional storage for CARE from Blue </p><p>Ribbon Foods Limited, so they can expand relief operations </p><p>into the northern districts.  Msipa said he had lobbied with </p><p>Minister July Moyo to get additional NGOs--including Save the </p><p>Children-UK and Africare--registered for food distribution. </p><p>He said he had told July Moyo not to believe much of what the </p><p>CIO told him about these NGOs. </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) On October 18, Ambassador and Political Officer also </p><p>met with the Catholic Bishop of Gweru, Bishop Mugadzi.  At </p><p>the conclusion of the meeting, Bishop Mugadzi admitted that </p><p>he had been nervous about our visit but midway through it he </p><p>felt at ease with meeting Western diplomats viewed as </p><p>controversial by the authorities.  The Bishop said the food </p><p>situation was bad in Gweru and among his parishioners but </p><p>because of GOZ legislation restricting food imports, the </p><p>Catholic Church had not been able to help as they have always </p><p>done in the past. The Bishop said the Catholic Church had </p><p>been shut out of food distribution but that the government </p><p>had no problem with the Church sourcing food as long as it </p><p>went through the government\'s Grain Marketing Board (GMB). </p><p>After our meeting, the Bishop seemed reenergized and ready to </p><p>try to do something about the food situation in Gweru, </p><p>probably through Catholic charities and Catholic Relief </p><p>Services. </p><p> </p><p>MAJORITY IN ZVISHAVANE RECEIVE FOOD AID </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>8. (U) We saw a general food distribution and supplementary </p><p>feeding in Mutambi village in Mutambi ward, Zvishavane </p><p>district. WFP through its implementing partner, CARE, has </p><p>been feeding people in Zvishavane since September 2002 but </p><p>began operations in Mberengwa in March.  The supplementary </p><p>feeding was at the local school and served every child in the </p><p>ward.  Children under 5-years old were served in the morning </p><p>and school-aged children were fed in the afternoon. </p><p>According to the principal, most students received at least </p><p>two meals a day and attendance in school has been very high. </p><p>CARE representatives said that while there had been some </p><p>problems in Mberengwa around the time of elections, feeding </p><p>programs had generally gone well with CARE able to designate </p><p>beneficiaries through open meetings, as WFP requires. </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) According to the principal, teachers, nurses, and </p><p>other professionals were suffering the most because they did </p><p>not qualify for food aid, could not take time off to wait for </p><p>corn from the Grain Marketing Board, and could not find corn </p><p>to buy. The principal wondered if the GMB could set aside </p><p>corn for other working professionals as it does for members </p><p>of the uniformed services.  (The Governor later told us he </p><p>was working to achieve this.) </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) WFP is providing food to 75 percent of the people in </p><p>Mutambi.  A number of beneficiaries reported that they had </p><p>cut down their food consumption to one or two meals a day. </p><p>On October 17, WFP was distributing 13 50-kg bags of </p><p>whole-kernel yellow corn and 2 cans of vegetable oil for each </p><p>member group of 10 families.  One 50-kg bag of corn (which </p><p>mills to about 33 kg of corn meal) will last a family of five </p><p>one month.  The remaining 25 percent of the population not </p><p>receiving food aid directly (mostly teachers and others with </p><p>work in the formal sector) were most likely given food by the </p><p>rest of the community.  According to the distribution </p><p>manager, people from the urban areas have been migrating back </p><p>to the rural areas in search of food. </p><p> </p><p>DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM FAIR </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>11. (U) The WFP/CARE officials said that when they first </p><p>began operations in Midlands, the ruling party tried to </p><p>interfere with the ward designation and beneficiary selection </p><p>process.  According to these officials, local ZANU-PF </p><p>officials were not happy with the process and wanted to use </p><p>the GOZ-appointed district administrators, who are notorious </p><p>for politicizing beneficiary lists, rather than the </p><p>traditional leaders.  The NGO community prevailed and the </p><p>beneficiary selection process described to us seemed very </p><p>transparent with the entire community involved in the </p><p>process.  They said that Governor Msipa had been helpful in </p><p>resolving disputes and that the Governor,s efforts to secure </p><p>free warehouse space were extraordinary. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>HIV/AIDS PERMEATES EVERYTHING </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>12. (U) On October 18, Ambassador and Political Officer </p><p>visited an impressive local NGO, Midlands AIDS Service </p><p>Organization (MASO), a local chief, and the Catholic Diocese </p><p>of Gweru to discuss HIV/AIDS.  MASO is a CDC grantee and was </p><p>established in 1991 to provide training, prevention, home </p><p>based care, and orphan care throughout the province.  The </p><p>visit included a presentation by a youth group and a meeting </p><p>with the uniformed services.  The Youth Alive Club is for </p><p>elementary-aged boys and girls with the goal of educating </p><p>them about HIV/AIDS and of developing skills they will need </p><p>to delay the age of first sexual encounter and to insist upon </p><p>the use of prophylactics.  The children performed skits in </p><p>which members of their families died from AIDS.  (COMMENT: </p><p>The fact that this community needs HIV/AIDS-specific clubs </p><p>for elementary-aged children is a good indicator of the </p><p>severity of the HIV problem in Zimbabwe.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>13. (U) The Catholic Church in Gweru has HIV/AIDS programs </p><p>too.  Bishop Mugadzi said the hospitals and clinics in the </p><p>province all have AIDS awareness and outreach programs and </p><p>the Church allows Youth Alive Clubs in the Catholic schools </p><p>as long as they skirt around the condom issue.  The Bishop </p><p>also said they were able to discuss HIV/AIDS with </p><p>parishioners where as a few years ago that was not the case. </p><p> </p><p>14. (U) We also met with Chief Cyprian Malisa, a traditional </p><p>chief from Silobela.  Chief Malisa was quoted in the </p><p>state-run newspaper, The Herald, on September 19 advocating </p><p>more open communication about HIV/AIDS and acceptance of </p><p>voluntary testing as a way of life.  Malisa said he first </p><p>noticed an increase in deaths about five or six years ago, </p><p>particularly those attributed to TB.  He said the symptoms </p><p>before death were coughs, swollen legs, and then thinning </p><p>out.  Malisa claimed that within a 5-km radius from his </p><p>house, 2-5 people died per week.  Malisa told us he had seen </p><p>an increase in women resorting to prostitution because of the </p><p>food crisis and he worried about the consequences of this. </p><p>He worried that as the food situation deteriorates HIV </p><p>infection rates would increase and only viable economic </p><p>alternatives would slow the spread of the disease but lack of </p><p>money, inputs, and water made economic development difficult. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15. (U) Malisa said AIDS deaths are having a terrible toll on </p><p>the community.  One of the traditional coping methods </p><p>available for widows--that of marrying one,s </p><p>brother-in-law--is no longer viable because it is assumed the </p><p>widow has AIDS too and will only infect the brother-in-law. </p><p>The number of orphans is overwhelming the community  and </p><p>there has been an increase in street children in Gweru.  When </p><p>asked whether home based care through MASO was available in </p><p>Silobela, Malisa said it existed but was hampered by </p><p>transportation problems--everyone must go on foot.  He said </p><p>bicycles would go a long way towards helping the caregivers. </p><p> </p><p>MEETING WITH UNIFORMED SERVICES ON HIV/AIDS </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>16. (U) MASO has been working with the uniformed services </p><p>(Air Force of  Zimbabwe, Zimbabwe Military Academy, Zimbabwe </p><p>Prison Services, and Zimbabwe Republic Police) since 1998 to </p><p>raise awareness and increase responsibility.  In all the </p><p>services, representatives reported an increase in awareness </p><p>about HIV/AIDS, increased demand for condoms, a decrease in </p><p>the incidence of sexually transmitted infections (Air Force </p><p>representatives reported a decrease from 21 to 3 percent), an </p><p>increase in the willingness to talk about HIV/AIDS, and less </p><p>stigmatism.  Constraints to further success and program </p><p>expansion were the lack of audiovisual equipment (TV, VCR, </p><p>projectors), condoms, literature, and medicines. (COMMENT: </p><p>According to our MASO guides, the uniformed services were </p><p>wary of meeting with us and initially denied the request when </p><p>MASO first proposed a meeting.  After MASO explained our role </p><p>in supporting their projects and the purpose of the meeting, </p><p>the uniformed services agreed to meet with us and were very </p><p>open about the HIV situation in their respective </p><p>organizations.  The uniformed services have historically been </p><p>very unwilling to discuss HIV/AIDS with the USG sufficiently </p><p>for us to be able to work with them.  Consequently, we will </p><p>explore further the possibility of working indirectly through </p><p>MASO.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>GOLD PANNING ON THE RISE </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>17. (U) In most of our meetings the rise in the level of </p><p>illegal gold and chrome panning and its effect on the local </p><p>community came up and one of the local newspapers had an </p><p>article on the topic too.  People have been resorting to gold </p><p>panning as the economic environment has worsened.  None of </p><p>our interlocutors thought the rise in gold panning was </p><p>helping fuel the HIV/AIDS crisis but doing nothing to help </p><p>alleviate the food crisis.  WFP representatives said the </p><p>youths who are typically engaged in this activity do not </p><p>remit payments to their less fortunate relatives but rather </p><p>spend it all in town on entertainment and Chief Silobela said </p><p>gold panning increased the level of prostitution in the area. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p>18.  (C) The information we learned from Midlands most likely </p><p>reflects the situation in the rest of the country--high </p><p>HIV/AIDS levels, severe food shortages, and intensified land </p><p>redistribution--but it is different in that public, private, </p><p>and civic leaders are working together to improve the </p><p>situation.  The efforts of a strong, respected, moderate </p><p>governor have meant less disorder, chaos, disruption, and </p><p>political conflict in the region. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
