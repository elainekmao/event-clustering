REASON 1.5 (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  SUMMARY.  PRESIDENT-ELECT NESTOR KIRCHNER ANNOUNCED </p><p>THE COMPOSITION OF HIS CABINET ON MAY 20.  AS KIRCHNER HAD </p><p>STATED DURING THE CAMPAIGN, ROBERTO LAVAGNA WILL CONTINUE ON </p><p>AS ECONOMY MINISTER.  THE BIGGEST SURPRISES WERE HIS </p><p>SELECTION OF JUDICIAL AFFAIRS EXPERT RAFAEL BIELSA AS FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER AND MEDICAL DOCTOR AND STAUNCH DUHALDISTA JOSE </p><p>PAMPURO AS DEFENSE MINISTER, GIVEN THAT NEITHER HAS MUCH </p><p>EXPERIENCE IN EITHER AREA.  CLOSE KIRCHNER ASSOCIATE ALBERTO </p><p>FERNANDEZ, WHO WAS THE EMBASSY\'S CLOSEST CONTACT IN THE </p><p>KIRCHNER CAMPAIGN, WILL SERVE AS CHIEF OF CABINET.  OF THE 13 </p><p>CABINET-LEVEL APPOINTMENTS, FIVE ARE LOYAL KIRCHNER </p><p>ASSOCIATES, FOUR ARE CARRYOVERS FROM THE DUHALDE </p><p>ADMINISTRATION, AND THE REMAINING FOUR ARE MORE POLITICALLY </p><p>INDEPENDENT - ORIENTED.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ABOUT KIRCHNER\'S CABINET </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  PRESIDENT-ELECT NESTOR KIRCHNER ANNOUNCED THE MAKEUP </p><p>OF HIS CABINET ON THE AFTERNOON OF MAY 20 FROM HIS HOME </p><p>PROVINCE OF SANTA CRUZ, WHERE HE HAS SERVED AS GOVERNOR FOR </p><p>THE PAST 12 YEARS. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE ONLY STRUCTURAL INNOVATION IN KIRCHNER\'S CABINET WILL </p><p>BE THE CREATION OF A MINISTRY OF FEDERAL PLANNING, PUBLIC </p><p>INVESTMENT, AND SERVICES -- REFLECTING KIRCHNER\'S PREFERENCE </p><p>AS SANTA CRUZ GOVERNOR FOR PUBLIC WORKS PROJECTS.  TO </p><p>ACCOMMODATE THIS CHANGE, THE MINISTRY OF PRODUCTION WILL </p><p>REVERT TO ITS PREVIOUS STATUS AS PART OF THE MINISTRY OF </p><p>ECONOMY.  IN ADDITION, THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION AND SCIENCE </p><p>AND TECHNOLOGY WILL BE CALLED THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION AND </p><p>CULTURE.  (UNDER THE ARGENTINE CONSTITUTION, THE CHIEF OF </p><p>CABINET PRESIDES OVER A CABINET OF TEN OTHER MINISTERS.  THE </p><p>POSTS OF SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE PRESIDENCY AND SECRETARY OF </p><p>STATE INTELLIGENCE ARE LOOSELY REFERRED TO AS CABINET-LEVEL </p><p>POSTS, ALTHOUGH THEY ARE NOT STRICTLY SPEAKING CABINET POSTS </p><p>AS THE CONSTITUTION DEFINES IT.) </p><p> </p><p>-- AT LEAST FIVE OF THE APPOINTMENTS ARE CLOSE KIRCHNER </p><p>ASSOCIATES.  ALBERTO FERNANDEZ, HIS CLOSEST ADVISOR (OTHER </p><p>THAN PERHAPS HIS WIFE CHRISTINA FERNANDEZ DE KIRCHNER), WILL </p><p>SERVE AS CHIEF OF CABINET.  THE OTHERS INCLUDE JULIO DE VIDO </p><p>(FEDERAL PLANNING, PUBLIC INVESTMENT AND SERVICES), </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL SISTER ALICIA KIRCHNER (SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT), </p><p>OSCAR PARRILLI (SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE PRESIDENCY), AND </p><p>SERGIO ACEVEDO (SECRETARY FOR STATE INTELLIGENCE). </p><p> </p><p>-- KIRCHNER RETAINED FOUR OF DUHALDE\'S HIGH-RANKING </p><p>OFFICIALS.  HOWEVER, ECONOMY MINISTER ROBERTO LAVAGNA AND </p><p>HEALTH MINISTER GINES GONZALEZ GARCIA APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN </p><p>CHOSEN MORE ON THEIR OWN MERITS THAN FOR ANY TIES THEY MIGHT </p><p>HAVE HAD WITH DUHALDE.  THE TWO DIEHARD DUHALDE LOYALISTS IN </p><p>KIRCHNER\'S CABINET WILL BE JOSE PAMPURO (DEFENSE, FORMERLY </p><p>SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE PRESIDENCY) AND ANIBAL FERNANDEZ </p><p>(INTERIOR, FORMERLY MINISTER OF PRODUCTION). </p><p> </p><p>-- KIRCHNER SELECTED TWO CURRENT MAYORAL CANDIDATES FOR THE </p><p>FEDERAL CAPITAL TO HIS CABINET, RAFAEL BIELSA (FOREIGN </p><p>AFFAIRS) AND GUSTAVO BELIZ (JUSTICE).  CHOOSING BOTH OF THEM </p><p>TO HIS CABINET GIVES KIRCHNER MORE FLEXIBILITY TO SUPPORT </p><p>CURRENT MAYOR ANIBAL IBARRA IN THE AUGUST 24 ELECTIONS, WHERE </p><p>IBARRA WILL COMPETE AGAINST THE FRONTRUNNER, BUSINESSMAN </p><p>MAURICO MACRI.  A MEMBER OF IBARRA\'S ADMINISTRATION IN THE </p><p>FEDERAL CAPITAL, MINISTER OF EDUCATION DANIEL FILMUS, WILL </p><p>SERVE IN KIRCHNER\'S CABINET AS WELL. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>KIRCHNER\'S CABINET: BIOGRAPHICAL COMMENTS </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  CHIEF OF CABINET:  ALBERTO FERNANDEZ.  FERNANDEZ IS </p><p>A 44-YEAR-OLD LOCAL PJ LEGISLATOR IN THE CITY OF BUENOS AIRES </p><p>AND AN EXPERT IN CRIMINAL LAW WITH A PRIVATE LAW PRACTICE. </p><p>HE HAS DIRECTED KIRCHNER\'S PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN EFFORT FROM </p><p>THE BEGINNING AND HAS EMERGED AS ONE OF KIRCHNER\'S CLOSEST </p><p>ADVISORS.  IN THE LATE 1980S, HE HELD MID-LEVEL POSTS IN THE </p><p>MINISTRY OF ECONOMY, AND IN 1989, WAS NAMED NATIONAL </p><p>SUPERINTENDENT OF INSURANCE.  DURING 1996-2000, HE SERVED AS </p><p>VICE PRESIDENT FOR BAPRO, ONE OF THE GOVERNING ENTITIES OF </p><p>THE BANCO DE LA PROVINCIA DE BUENOS AIRES.  HE WAS FIRST </p><p>ELECTED TO THE CITY LEGISLATURE FOR THE FEDERAL CAPITAL IN </p><p>2000.  POLOFFS HAVE FOUND FERNANDEZ TO BE ARTICULATE AND </p><p>FORTHCOMING INTERLOCUTOR, AND QUITE OPEN TO PRIVATE MEETINGS </p><p>WITH THE EMBASSY -- IN STARK CONTRAST TO KIRCHNER. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  MINISTER OF INTERIOR:  ANIBAL FERNANDEZ.  PRIOR TO </p><p>BECOMING DUHALDE\'S MINISTER OF PRODUCTION IN OCTOBER 2002, HE </p><p>SERVED AS PRESIDENT DUHALDE\'S FIRST SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE </p><p>PRESIDENCY, A HIGH-PROFILE JOB (RESPONSIBLE FOR THE </p><p>ADMINISTRATION OF PRESIDENTIAL SPENDING AND POLICY </p><p>ARTICULATION WITH OTHER MINISTERS) DURING A TURBULENT PERIOD </p><p>IN ARGENTINE HISTORY.  FERNANDEZ GAINED POLITICAL PROMINENCE </p><p>IN THE BUENOS AIRES PJ MACHINE BY SERVING AS MAYOR OF THE </p><p>WORKING CLASS BUENOS AIRES SUBURB OF QUILMES AND LATER, IN </p><p>2001, AS THEN-GOVERNOR CARLOS RUCKAUF\'S MINISTER OF LABOR. </p><p>HE FACED DRAMATIC CONFRONTATIONS DURING HIS TENURE AS MAYOR </p><p>AND PROVINCIAL LABOR MINISTER, INCLUDING HAVING FACED CHARGES </p><p>OF CORRUPTION AND HAVING BEEN BRIEFLY HELD HOSTAGE IN THE </p><p>MINISTRY BY PIQUETERO FAMILIES DEMANDING RENEWAL OF JOB </p><p>SUBSIDIES.  IN ADDITION, ALTHOUGH THE CHARGES WERE NEVER </p><p>FULLY SUBSTANTIATED, EMBASSY CONTACTS ALLEGED THAT WHILE </p><p>PROVINCIAL LABOR MINISTER, FERNANDEZ AND OTHER PJ PROVINCIAL </p><p>LEADERS NOT ONLY REMAINED PASSIVE WHILE THE LOOTINGS AND </p><p>VIOLENCE RAGED IN DECEMBER 2001 AND ULTIMATELY LED TO </p><p>PRESIDENT FERNANDO DE LA RUA\'S RESIGNATION, BUT ACTIVELY </p><p>STIMULATED THE UNREST.  THE 46-YEAR-OLD FERNANDEZ IS A PUBLIC </p><p>ACCOUNTANT AND LAWYER BY TRAINING.  IN THE ARGENTINE SYSTEM, </p><p>THE MINISTER OF INTERIOR\'S CHIEF RESPONSIBILITY IS MANAGING </p><p>THE GOA\'S CRITICAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PROVINCES.  (THIS </p><p>AND ADDITIONAL BIO INFORMATION ON FERNANDEZ WAS PREVIOUSLY </p><p>REPORTED IN REF A). </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS, FOREIGN TRADE, AND </p><p>WORSHIP:  RAFAEL BIELSA.  A LAWYER BY TRAINING, BIELSA IS AN </p><p>EXPERT IN JUDICIAL AFFAIRS AND PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION, AND A </p><p>STRONG ADVOCATE FOR JUDICIAL TRANSPARENCY.  HIS PERONIST </p><p>CREDENTIALS DATE BACK TO THE 1970S, BUT HE AFFILIATED WITH </p><p>FREPASO, A PERONIST SPLINTER GROUP, IN THE 1990S.  DURING THE </p><p>DE LA RUA ADMINISTRATION, BIELSA SERVED AS CHAIRMAN OF THE </p><p>NATIONAL COMMISSION FOR JUDICIAL REFORM AND THE PRESIDENT OF </p><p>THE NATIONAL COMPTROLLER\'S OFFICE.  HIS ACCUSATIONS AGAINST </p><p>DE LA RUA\'S INTELLIGENCE SECRETARY FERNANDO DE SANTIBANEZ FOR </p><p>MISUSING FUNDS LED TO THE LATTER\'S RESIGNATION IN OCTOBER </p><p>2000.  THE 50-YEAR-OLD BIELSA RECEIVED HIS LAW DEGREE FROM </p><p>THE UNIVERSITY OF BUENOS AIRES AND ALSO STUDIED AT THE </p><p>UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA.  HIS BROTHER MARCELO IS THE COACH OF </p><p>THE ARGENTINE NATIONAL SOCCER TEAM.  BIELSA WAS A SURPRISE </p><p>CHOICE FOR THIS POST, HAVING BEEN RUMORED INSTEAD AS </p><p>KIRCHNER\'S MINISTER OF JUSTICE.  HE DOES NOT APPEAR TO HAVE </p><p>ANY FOREIGN AFFAIRS EXPERIENCE.  A SENIOR FOREIGN MINISTRY </p><p>OFFICIAL ANTICIPATES HE WILL KEEP MARTIN REDRADO ON AS DEPUTY </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  MINISTER OF DEFENSE:  JOSE PAMPURO.  AS REPORTED IN </p><p>REF B, PAMPURO SERVED AS DUHALDE\'S PRIVATE SECRETARY IN 2002, </p><p>BECOMING SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE PRESIDENCY IN OCTOBER OF </p><p>THAT YEAR.  A MEDICAL SURGEON BY TRAINING, HE WAS MINISTER OF </p><p>HEALTH OF THE PROVINCE OF BUENOS AIRES DURING DUHALDE\'S </p><p>TENURE AS GOVERNOR IN THE 1990S.  HE ALSO SERVED PREVIOUSLY </p><p>AS A NATIONAL DEPUTY IN THE LATE 1980S.  HE AND DUHALDE HAVE </p><p>KNOWN EACH OTHER FOR 20 YEARS, AND HE ENJOYS THE CONFIDENCE </p><p>OF THE CURRENT PRESIDENT TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT HE ONCE </p><p>DECLARED, "I AM DUHALDE."  THE 53-YEAR-OLD PAMPURO SPEAKS </p><p>ENGLISH AND ONCE TOOK A SIX-MONTH SPECIALIZATION COURSE AT </p><p>MT. SINAI HOSPITAL IN NEW YORK. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  MINISTER OF EDUCATION AND PRODUCTION:  ROBERTO </p><p>LAVAGNA.  DUHALDE\'S CURRENT MINISTER OF ECONOMY WAS THE ONLY </p><p>NAME EXPLICITLY ANNOUNCED IN ADVANCE BY THEN-CANDIDATE </p><p>KIRCHNER PRIOR TO THE ELECTION.  ONE INFLUENTIAL MEMBER OF </p><p>KIRCHNER\'S CAMPAIGN TOLD EMBASSY OFFICERS THAT KIRCHNER HAS </p><p>MET WITH LAVAGNA FOR MORE THAN AN HOUR PER DAY SINCE KIRCHNER </p><p>ANNOUNCED THAT LAVAGNA WOULD BE HIS CHOICE FOR ECONOMY </p><p>MINISTER. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  MINISTER OF FEDERAL PLANNING, PUBLIC INVESTMENT AND </p><p>SERVICES:  JULIO DE VIDO.  WHILE SERVING AS KIRCHNER\'S </p><p>MINISTER OF GOVERNMENT OF SANTA CRUZ, DE VIDO COORDINATED THE </p><p>TECHNICAL TEAM THAT PREPARED THE CANDIDATE\'S PLAN OF </p><p>GOVERNMENT (SEPTEL).  DE VIDO WAS BORN IN SANTA CRUZ AND IS </p><p>CONSIDERED CLOSE TO THE PRESIDENT-ELECT.  HE FORMERLY SERVED </p><p>AS THE PROVINCIAL MINISTER OF ECONOMY UNDER KIRCHNER.  DURING </p><p>A MAY 14 MEETING WITH ECONCOUNS, DE VIDO STRESSED THE </p><p>IMPORTANCE THAT THE KIRCHNER ADMINISTRATION WOULD PAY TO </p><p>RUNNING A PRIMARY FISCAL SURPLUS "FROM DAY ONE." </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U)  MINISTER OF JUSTICE, SECURITY, AND HUMAN RIGHTS: </p><p>GUSTAVO BELIZ.  ONCE VIEWED AS FORMER PRESIDENT CARLOS </p><p>MENEM\'S PROTEGE BEFORE THEIR FALLING OUT, BELIZ WAS NAMED </p><p>MENEM\'S INTERIOR MINISTER IN 1992 WHILE ONLY 30 YEARS OLD. </p><p>HE RESIGNED THE POST A YEAR LATER, ALLEGING THAT HIS EFFORTS </p><p>TO CLEAN UP THE MINISTRY\'S ADMINISTRATION WERE BEING THWARTED </p><p>BY OTHERS IN THE GOVERNMENT.  A PERSISTENT CRITIC OF </p><p>CORRUPTION AND POLITICAL MANIPULATION OF THE JUDICIARY, HE </p><p>RESIGNED HIS PJ PARTY MEMBERSHIP IN EARLY 1996.  UNDER HIS </p><p>OWN "NEW LEADERSHIP PARTY" BANNER, HE RAN A SURPRISINGLY </p><p>STRONG BUT UNSUCCESSFUL CAMPAIGN FOR MAYOR OF THE FEDERAL </p><p>CAPITAL THAT YEAR.  IN 2000, HE RAN AS DOMINGO CAVALLO\'S </p><p>RUNNING MATE IN THE MAYORAL RACE FOR THE FEDERAL CAPITAL, BUT </p><p>CAVALLO WAS DEFEATED BY CURRENT MAYOR ANIBAL IBARRA.  BELIZ\'S </p><p>ATTEMPT TO WIN A NATIONAL SENATE SEAT FOR THE FEDERAL CAPITAL </p><p>IN 2001 ENDED UP IN A STILL-UNRESOLVED COURT DISPUTE WITH </p><p>SOCIALIST CANDIDATE ALFREDO BRAVO.  THE 40-YEAR-OLD BELIZ HAS </p><p>A LAW DEGREE FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF BUENOS AIRES.  IN THE </p><p>PRESS, BELIZ\'S AUSTERE LIFESTYLE AND DEVOUT CATHOLICISM ARE </p><p>HIS TWO MOST FREQUENTLY CITED PERSONAL ATTRIBUTES. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U)  MINISTER OF EDUCATION AND CULTURE:  DANIEL FILMUS. </p><p>THE 47-YEAR-OLD FILMUS IS CURRENTLY SECRETARY OF EDUCATION </p><p>FOR THE FEDERAL CAPITAL, WHERE HIS WORK WAS PRAISED BY </p><p>THEN-CANDIDATE KIRCHNER.  FILMUS RECEIVED HIS UNDERGRADUATE </p><p>DEGREE FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF BUENOS AIRES IN 1977 AND HIS </p><p>MASTERS DEGREE FROM THE FEDERAL UNIVERSITY FLUMINENSE </p><p>(BRAZIL) IN 1989. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U)  MINISTER OF LABOR, EMPLOYMENT AND SOCIAL SECURITY: </p><p>CARLOS TOMADA.  THE LAWYER TOMADA HAS SERVED IN VARIOUS </p><p>POSITIONS IN THE LABOR MINISTRY OVER THE YEARS, INCLUDING </p><p>HAVING HEADED THE SECTION CHARGED WITH RESOLVING LABOR - </p><p>MANAGEMENT DISPUTES.  MOST RECENTLY, HE WAS THE SECRETARY OF </p><p>LABOR -- ESSENTIALLY, DEPUTY MINISTER -- IN THE FIRST FEW </p><p>MONTHS OF THE DUHALDE GOVERNMENT UNDER THEN-MINISTER ALFREDO </p><p>ATANASOF.  TOMADA RESIGNED THAT POSITION WHEN ATANASOF LEFT </p><p>THE MINISTRY TO BECOME CHIEF OF STAFF AND GRACIELA CAMANO </p><p>BECAME MINISTER.  TOMADA HAS HIS OWN LAW OFFICE AND, AS A </p><p>PROFESSOR, HAS HEADED THE LABOR RELATIONS PROGRAM OF THE </p><p>SCHOOL OF SOCIAL SCIENCES AT THE UNIVERSITY OF BUENOS AIRES. </p><p>IN 1990, THE EMBASSY SENT TOMADA ON AN INDIVIDUAL </p><p>INTERNATIONAL VISITOR PROGRAM, AND HE HAS WORKED CLOSELY WITH </p><p>EMBASSY LABOR ATTACHES SINCE THEN, PARTICULARLY IN PROMOTING </p><p>ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION, SUCH AS MEDIATION AND </p><p>CONCILIATION.  IN THE ARGENTINE SYSTEM, THE POST OF LABOR </p><p>MINISTER IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE MINISTRY HAS </p><p>ULTIMATE RESPONSIBILITY OVER THE MANAGEMENT OF MANY OF THE </p><p>EMPLOYMENT SUBSIDY PROGRAMS, INCLUDING OVER 2 MILLION </p><p>BENEFICIARIES IN THE HEADS OF HOUSEHOLD SUBSIDY ALONE. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (U)  MINISTER OF HEALTH:  GINES GONZALEZ GARCIA. </p><p>PRESIDENT DUHALDE APPOINTED GONZALEZ GARCIA AS HIS MINISTER </p><p>OF HEALTH IN OCTOBER 2002.  DURING THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN, </p><p>KIRCHNER HAD GIVEN SIGNALS THAT GONZALEZ GARCIA WOULD STAY IN </p><p>THAT POST WERE HE TO WIN THE PRESIDENCY, LARGELY BECAUSE OF </p><p>THE WIDESPREAD PUBLIC ACCLAIM HE ENJOYED AS A RESULT OF HIS </p><p>POLICIES TO LOWER DRUG PRICES.  PRESS REPORTS INDICATE THAT </p><p>THE 57-YEAR-OLD MINISTER-DESIGNATE HAS A LONG-STANDING </p><p>ACQUAINTANCE WITH KIRCHNER.  GONAZALEZ GARCIA RECEIVED HIS </p><p>MEDICAL DEGREE FROM THE NATIONAL UNIVERSITY OF CORDOBA IN </p><p>1968 AND IS A MEMBER OF NUMEROUS PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS IN </p><p>ARGENTINA AND ABROAD, INCLUDING THE AMERICAN MEDICAL </p><p>ASSOCIATION. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (U)  MINISTER OF SOCIAL ACTION:  ALICIA KIRCHNER. </p><p>KIRCHNER\'S OLDER SISTER CURRENTLY SERVES IN THIS CAPACITY IN </p><p>KIRCHNER\'S GUBERNATORIAL ADMINISTRATION IN SANTA CRUZ. </p><p>ALICIA KIRCHNER HAD BEEN RUMORED FOR THIS POSITION FOR THE </p><p>PAST SEVERAL DAYS; THE PRESIDENT-ELECT\'S ONLY DOUBTS </p><p>REPORTEDLY CONCERNED THE ADVISABILITY OF NAMING A RELATIVE TO </p><p>A CABINET POST. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (U)  SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE PRESIDENCY:  OSCAR </p><p>PARRILLI.  KIRCHNER\'S TOP CAMPAIGN ADVISOR IN THE PROVINCE OF </p><p>NEUQUEN, PARRILLI IS AN EX-NATIONAL DEPUTY AND PROVINCIAL </p><p>LAWMAKER.  ALONG WITH KIRCHNER\'S WIFE, SENATOR CHRISTINA </p><p>FERNANDEZ DE KIRCHNER, HE STRONGLY CRITICIZED THE VIOLENCE </p><p>FOMENTED BY PJ SENATOR LUIS BARRIONUEVO IN CATAMARCA IN EARLY </p><p>MARCH 2002 THAT LED TO THE POSTPONEMENT OF PROVINCIAL </p><p>ELECTIONS THERE.  OF ALL THE PERSONNEL ANNOUNCEMENTS MADE BY </p><p>KIRCHNER, PARRILLI IS PERHAPS THE LEAST KNOWN. </p><p> </p><p>15.  (C)  SECRETARY FOR STATE INTELLIGENCE (SIDE):  SERGIO </p><p>ACEVEDO.  ACEVEDO IS A 47-YEAR-OLD NATIONAL DEPUTY FROM </p><p>KIRCHNER\'S HOME PROVINCE OF SANTA CRUZ AND HAS SERVED IN </p><p>RECENT YEARS AS THE CHAIRMAN OF THE IMPEACHMENT COMMITTEE IN </p><p>THE LOWER HOUSE.  IN THAT CAPACITY, HE SPEARHEADED EFFORTS IN </p><p>2002 TO IMPEACH ALL NINE MEMBERS OF THE SUPREME COURT, AN </p><p>EFFORT THAT ULTIMATELY FELL SHORT OF THE TWO-THIRDS MAJORITY </p><p>NEEDED IN THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES AFTER THE DUHALDE </p><p>ADMINISTRATION ABANDONED ITS INITIAL SUPPORT FOR THE </p><p>IMPEACHMENT EFFORT.  ACEVEDO FIRST SERVED IN THE CHAMBER OF </p><p>DEPUTIES DURING THE PERIOD 1995-1999, THEN SERVED AS </p><p>KIRCHNER\'S VICE GOVERNOR IN SANTA CRUZ DURING 1999-2001, </p><p>BEFORE RETURNING TO THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES IN 2001.  ACEVEDO </p><p>IS A LAWYER BY TRAINING, HAVING RECEIVED HIS DEGREE FROM THE </p><p>UNIVERSITY OF BUENOS AIRES IN 1979.  AS HEAD OF ARGENTINA\'S </p><p>INTELLIGENCE SERVICE, ACEVEDO WILL BE IN CHARGE OF BOTH </p><p>FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC ESPIONAGE; SIDE ALSO IS AN IMPORTANT </p><p>ELEMENT IN GOA COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS.  SIDE HAS A LONG </p><p>HISTORY OF INVOLVEMENT IN DOMESTIC POLITICS FOR WHICH IT </p><p>UTILIZES A LARGE NON-TRANSPARENT BUDGET PROCESS TO SUPPORT </p><p>THE PRESIDENT\'S POLITICAL OBJECTIVES.  HIS APPOINTMENT IS </p><p>CLEARLY BASED MORE ON THE FACT THAT HE IS A CLOSE CONFIDANT </p><p>OF KIRCHNER THAN ON ANY BACKGROUND IN INTELLIGENCE MATTERS. </p><p>HIS ASSOCIATION WITH THE LEFT WING OF THE PERONIST PARTY AND </p><p>HIS RUMORED HISTORY AS A FORMER MONTENERO GUERRILLA IN THE </p><p>1970S, RAISE SOME DOUBTS ABOUT HIS INCLINATIONS ON FOREIGN </p><p>INTELLIGENCE COOPERATION. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>WALSH </p><p></p></div>
