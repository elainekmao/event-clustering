<p>UNCLAS AMMAN 005463 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/PDD (CBOURGEOIS); IIP/IT (SHEPPARD) </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: OIIP, AADP, ASEC, ACOA, AMGT </p><p>SUBJECT: NEED FOR PD NETWORK </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 134398 </p><p> </p><p>POST HAS NOTED SOME DISCUSSION THAT SEEMS TO INDICATE </p><p>THAT OPENNET PLUS WOULD AND SHOULD REPLACE PDNET </p><p>OVERSEAS.  WE WOULD LIKE TO CLARIFY THAT DESPITE THE </p><p>PROJECTED ARRIVAL OF OPENNET PLUS AT SOME TIME IN THE </p><p>FUTURE, WE WILL CONTINUE TO NEED A SEPARATE PDNET IN </p><p>ORDER TO MEET ALL OUR INTERACTIVE REQUIREMENTS. </p><p>ALTHOUGH OPENNET PLUS WILL PROVIDE WIDER ACCESS TO THE </p><p>INTERNET THROUGHOUT THE EMBASSY, AS AN SBU SYSTEM IT IS </p><p>UNLIKELY TO PROVIDE THE OPEN INTERACTIVE ENVIRONMENT </p><p>NEEDED FOR PUBLIC INTERACTION.  AS WE CONTINUE OUR </p><p>EFFORTS TO STAY ON THE CUTTING EDGE OF TECHNOLOGY IN </p><p>BOTH OUTREACH AND IN INFORMATION GATHERING, WE WILL </p><p>CONTINUE TO NEED THE ABILITY TO EXPERIMENT WITH NEW </p><p>APPLICATIONS AND NEW DOWNLOADS FROM NON-GOVERNMEENT </p><p>SITES, TO ACCESS INFORMATION INCLUDING PHOTO, VIDEO, </p><p>SOUND, AND EXECUTABLE FILES FROM A VARIETY OF SOURCES, </p><p>AND TO ENCOURAGE INTERACTION WITH A WIDE PUBLIC </p><p>AUDIENCE. THESE NEEDS ARE PARTICULAR TO PD WORK AND </p><p>NONE ARE LIKELY TO BE MET THROUGH AN OPENNET THAT WOULD </p><p>STILL PROVIDE APPROPRIATE SECURITY FOR THE EMBASSY AS A </p><p>WHOLE. </p><p>IN OUR VIEW, OPENNET PLUS AND PDNET ARE NOT </p><p>INTERCHANGEABLE.  DISCONTINUING PDNET WOULD HAVE A </p><p>DEMONSTRABLY NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR ABILITY TO HARDNESS </p><p>INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY FOR PUBLIC DIPLOMACY PURPOSES. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
