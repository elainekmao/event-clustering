<p>UNCLAS HALIFAX 000167 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR WHA/CAN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, EFIS, ECON, CA </p><p>SUBJECT: NEWFOUNDLAND CHALLENGES OTTAWA OVER FISH </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. HALIFAX 0110;  B. 02 OTTAWA 3256 </p><p> </p><p>1.  SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED - ENTIRE TEXT </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) SUMMARY:  The Newfoundland-Labrador government, stung </p><p>by Ottawa\'s decision to shut down the province\'s cod fishery, is </p><p>seeking a constitutional amendment to force the federal </p><p>government to share control of the fishing industry.  (END </p><p>SUMMARY) </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Newfoundland-Labrador\'s Deputy Minister of </p><p>Intergovernmental Affairs told us on May 14 that his political </p><p>masters are committed to their quest to obtain shared management </p><p>of the fishery in waters off the province, following the federal </p><p>government\'s unilateral decision to end cod fishing there. </p><p>Andrew Noseworthy, a veteran bureaucrat who has served in </p><p>several Newfoundland-Labrador administrations, dismissed the </p><p>notion that current Premier Roger Grimes is exploiting this </p><p>hot-button issue to garner popularity before he calls a </p><p>provincial election.  Noseworthy acknowledged the move does give </p><p>a high-profile opportunity to the governing Liberals. </p><p>Nonetheless, he emphasized that all three political parties in </p><p>the Newfoundland-Labrador House of Assembly voted unanimously to </p><p>support Premier Grimes\' resolution, which called on Ottawa to </p><p>renegotiate its constitutional right to manage the fishery. </p><p>Accordingly, all the parties have obligated themselves to </p><p>support the initiative regardless of the election outcome. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Noseworthy asserted that any new provincial government </p><p>will pursue the case, noting that the Progressive Conservative </p><p>Party had first sought greater provincial control of the fishery </p><p>in 1979.  Successive PC and Liberal governments have maintained </p><p>that the federal government has failed to lived up to its </p><p>constitutional obligation to manage the fishery in such a way as </p><p>to ensure the continued economic well-being of the province. </p><p>The historical document which Premier Grimes wants to amend is </p><p>the Terms of Union, which brought Newfoundland-Labrador into the </p><p>Canadian Confederation in 1949.  By agreeing to union with </p><p>Canada, Newfoundland-Labrador relinquished control of its </p><p>fishery, accepting the principle of federal supremacy in </p><p>management of the resource. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) While Newfoundland remains committed to this issue, </p><p>Nova Scotia would prefer that its neighbor refrain from </p><p>challenging the status quo.  Peter Underwood, Nova Scotia\'s </p><p>Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, told Congen that </p><p>his province would likely maintain its longstanding refusal to </p><p>support any initiative to give Newfoundland-Labrador a greater </p><p>say in the management of the fishery.  Nova Scotia fishermen </p><p>enjoy historical access to the waters off Newfoundland-Labrador, </p><p>a right that is currently recognized in how Ottawa allocates </p><p>access in the commercial fishery.  As Underwood explained, Nova </p><p>Scotia has had similar battles with Ottawa on fishery management </p><p>issues, but has never believed that revising the existing </p><p>management structure was a viable solution, especially as there </p><p>would be a high political price to pay as well. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) COMMENT:  Newfoundlanders attach tremendous </p><p>significance to the cod fishery, not only because of its </p><p>importance to the province\'s economy, but also because of the </p><p>vital and highly symbolic role that cod fishing played in the </p><p>history of Newfoundland.  While we hear varying opinions on the </p><p>motives underlying Premier Grimes\' actions with regard to this </p><p>highly emotional issue, constitution-watchers in Atlantic Canada </p><p>agree that the province\'s actions have the potential to open up </p><p>a new round of constitutional debate in the country.  (END </p><p>COMMENT) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>KASHKETT </p><p></p></div>
