<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 003620 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/30/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: KING PARDONS TOUJAN FAISAL: EFFECT ON HER </p><p>POLITICAL FUTURE UNCLEAR </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. AMMAN 2559 </p><p>     B. 3249 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMBASSADOR EDWARD W. GNEHM. REASONS: 1.5 (B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY.  King Abdullah issued a pardon June 26 which </p><p>released Toujan Faisal from detention and vacated the State </p><p>Security Court\'s decision to sentence her to one and one half </p><p>years in prison (reftels).  Faisal, who had been hospitalized </p><p>due to deteriorating health, was detained for 100 days. </p><p>According to media reports, she is currently convalescing  at </p><p>home.  Whether she will be able to run for parliament or hold </p><p>other offices in light of this pardon is unclear.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p>FAISAL PARDONED FROM SENTENCE, STILL GUILTY OF SEDITION </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  Toujan Faisal was released from the King Hussein </p><p>Medical Center June 27 after being issued an official pardon </p><p>by the King.  Her health is not good, but she is expected to </p><p>recover fully from her hunger strike as well as from breast </p><p>cancer (as reported by local media).  The King has been under </p><p>pressure to pardon the former MP from within the GOJ as well </p><p>as from Jordanian human rights activists and the local </p><p>Circassian community.  Reportedly, PM Abul Ragheb, after </p><p>meeting with Circassian community leaders, sent a letter to </p><p>the King requesting her release.  (Note:  the PM is widely </p><p>believed to have been the main driving force behind Faisal\'s </p><p>arrest/imprisonment - reftels).  Long-time Embassy contact </p><p>and human rights activist Fawzi Samhoury (protect) explained </p><p>that the pardon is from punishment only, and that Faisal is </p><p>still convicted, by the State Security Court, of the crime of </p><p>sedition against the GOJ.  The limit of the pardon was </p><p>confirmed by a senior GOJ official.  The conviction presents </p><p>a barrier if Faisal attempts either to run for parliament or </p><p>to hold another office; Samhoury explained that Jordanian law </p><p>prohibits people guilty of \'non-political\' crimes from </p><p>seeking office.  Note:  \'non-political crime\' is a term not </p><p>defined by statute or legislation, and if Faisal does seek </p><p>public office she may argue that her conviction was of a </p><p>\'political\' crime\' in an effort to obviate this barrier. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)   The pardon of Faisal is a politically savvy move by </p><p>the King.  Many Jordanians were hoping for the pardon, </p><p>believing that the former MP, although argumentative and </p><p>offensive to many, was the victim of a political vendetta. </p><p>Where Faisal goes from here is uncertain, but assuming that </p><p>her health recovers, it will be interesting to see what the </p><p>effect of her recent experience in the State Security Court </p><p>will have on her outspoken character.  If there is an avenue </p><p>through which Faisal can run for office legally, she may </p><p>resurface in the Jordanian political scene. </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
