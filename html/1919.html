<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 002172 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/27/2011 </p><p>TAGS: KPKO, MARR, PREL, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: UNAMSIL MANDATE RENEWAL </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 147877 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter; Reasons 1.5 (b) and </p><p>(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) PolMilOff spoke with Director of American and </p><p>Caribbean Affairs (and former Deputy Director of West African </p><p>Affairs) Basil Ukpong of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on </p><p>August 27.  After a friendly exchange of compliments on the </p><p>efforts of both the U.S. and Nigeria to bring peace to Sierra </p><p>Leone, Ukpong stated that U.S. support had turned UNAMSIL </p><p>around, as was clear from recent progress towards peace and </p><p>disarmament.  PolMilOff asked if Nigeria would support the </p><p>UNAMSIL mandate renewal.  Ukpong laughed, and said, "Of </p><p>course." </p><p>2. (C) During an August 28 meeting focused otherwise on </p><p>Zimbabwe (septel), DCM asked MFA Director for African Affairs </p><p>Ambassador Femi George if Nigeria would support UNAMSIL </p><p>renewal.  George laughed and said, "That\'s a foregone </p><p>conclusion.  Why are you troubling yourself to ask?" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Turning serious, George commented that Nigeria was </p><p>concerned that the Special Court should adopt proper </p><p>procedures and attitudes.  Otherwise, the current level of </p><p>cooperation the RUF was offering might be lost, with serious </p><p>consequences for the UN Mission.  It was perfectly alright, </p><p>he opined, to proceed quickly against the people "everybody </p><p>knew" were responsible for atrocities.  However, the "other </p><p>pillar, the Truth and Reconciliation Committee," needed time </p><p>to "do its work and bring out the facts and revelations" </p><p>before certain others could be brought before the court. </p><p>This might take time, George continued, and the international </p><p>community needed to show the proper measure of patience. </p><p>Nigeria was planning to second officers to the Court and to </p><p>provide approximately $100,000 in funding, George added, </p><p>noting that final arrangements for this assistance were not </p><p>yet in place. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
