<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 BOGOTA 09347 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS: KPRP, PINS, MILI, PTER, CO </p><p>SUBJECT: PROSPECTS FOR COLOMBIA\'S GUERRILLA WAR </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: THE GUERRILLA WAR IN COLOMBIA IS </p><p>STALEMATED: THE GUERRILLAS ARE UNABLE TO CONTROL AREAS </p><p>OF SIGNIFICANT POPULATION OR ENGAGE IN SET-PIECE </p><p>BATTLES, BUT THE GOVERNMENT IS UNLIKELY TO DESTROY </p><p>THEM.  FIGHTING MAY INCREASE FOLLOWING THE INAUGURATION </p><p>OF THE BARCO ADMINISTRATION.  THE GROUPS OUTSIDE THE </p><p>PEACE PROCESS WILL CONTINUE TO FIGHT, BUT THE MAIN </p><p>LONG-TERM GUERRILLA THREAT IS THE FARC: WELL-ARMED, </p><p>WELL-FINANCED, POLITICALLY DURABLE, AND (FOR NOW) IN THE </p><p>PEACE PROCESS.  THE COLOMBIAN ARMED FORCES ARE HAMPERED </p><p>BY PROBLEMS OF PERSONNEL, INTELLIGENCE AND EQUIPMENT, </p><p>AND WOULD BE HARD PRESSED TO ENGAGE ALL COLOMBIA\'S </p><p>GUERRILLA GROUPS AT ONE TIME.  THE ARMED FORCES AND </p><p>PRESIDENT-ELECT BARCO ARE AWARE OF THESE DEFICIENCIES </p><p>AND WILL SEEK TO RECTIFY THEM.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A NEW BALL GAME? </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) FROM NEW PRESIDENT A NEW APPROACH: COLOMBIA IS </p><p>ABOUT TO ENTER A NEW STAGE IN ITS THIRTY-YEAR BATTLE </p><p>WITH GUERRILLA INSURGENCY.  VIRGILIO BARCO AS THE NEW </p><p>PRESIDENT IS EXPECTED TO CHANGE THE GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>ATTITUDE TOWARDS THE GUERRILLA FORCES RANGED AGAINST </p><p>IT.  BARCO HAS TOLD US OF HIS INTENTION TO MAKE THE </p><p>PEACE PROCESS CONFORM TO THE INTERESTS OF THE COLOMBIAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT AND PEOPLE, AND REDUCE GUERRILLA MANIPULATION </p><p>OF THE PROCESS.  HE WILL OFFER SOME ECONOMIC AND </p><p>POLITICAL REFORMS, CONCENTRATED IN RURAL AREAS WHERE THE </p><p>INSURGENCIES ARE STRONG.  HE HAS ALSO SAID THAT HE WILL </p><p>STRENGTHEN THE ARMED FORCES.  HOW THE GUERRILLA FORCES </p><p>WILL REACT TO BARCO\'S TWO-HANDED POLICY IS THE KEY </p><p>QUESTION. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C/NF) THE INSURGENT LINE-UP: THE COLOMBIAN </p><p>INSURGENCY IS A COMPLEX AND CONTRADICTORY PHENOMENON. </p><p>THE LARGEST OF COLOMBIA\'S GUERRILLA GROUPS, THE </p><p>REVOLUTIONARY ARMED FORCES OF COLOMBIA (FARC), IS AT </p><p>PRESENT THE LEAST ACTIVE MILITARILY DUE TO ITS </p><p>PARTICIPATION IN THE PEACE PROCESS.  THE FARC MAINTAINS </p><p>AROUND 4,000 PERSONNEL.  COLOMBIAN ARMY SOURCES INDICATE </p><p>THAT THIS NUMBER INCLUDES ONLY HEAVILY ARMED FIGHTERS, </p><p>WITH SOME "FRONTS" (LOCAL FARC UNITS, DIVIDED ON A </p><p>GEOGRAPHIC BASIS) ABLE TO QUINTUPLE THEIR STRENGTH </p><p>THROUGH USE OF LIGHTLY ARMED AUXILIARIES.  A SEPARATE </p><p>AND RECENT ESTIMATE DIVIDED FARC GUERRILLAS BETWEEN FULL </p><p>AND PART-TIMERS, AND CAME UP WITH 3,500 UNDER EACH </p><p>HEADING.  THE FATE OF THE PEACE PROCESS WILL DETERMINE </p><p>WHETHER THIS CONSIDERABLE FORCE IS BROUGHT INTO THE </p><p>SCALES AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT.  THE REMAINING INSURGENT </p><p>GROUPS IN THE REVOLUTIONARY SPECTRUM -- THE M-19, </p><p>NATIONAL LIBERATION ARMY (ELN), POPULAR LIBERATION ARMY </p><p>(EPL), AND THE MINOR GUERRILLA GROUPS HAVE LARGELY </p><p>ABANDONED THE PEACE PROCESS, ALTHOUGH TWO FRONTS OF THE </p><p>ELN REMAIN INSIDE.  OFFICIAL COLOMBIAN ESTIMATES OF THE </p><p>STRENGTH OF THE REMAINING MAJOR INSURGENT GROUPS </p><p>(INCLUDING BOTH FULL AND PART-TIME GUERRILLAS) ARE AS </p><p>FOLLOWS:  AROUND 650 EPL, ABOUT THE SAME NUMBER OF ELN, </p><p>AND OVER 1,400 M-19.  WE DO NOT HAVE GREAT CONFIDENCE IN </p><p>ANY OF THESE ESTIMATES.  WHEN COLOMBIAN SECURITY FORCES </p><p>WISH TO LOOK SUCCESSFUL, THE NUMBERS GO DOWN; WHEN THEY </p><p>TALK ABOUT NEEDING MORE RESOURCES, THE NUMBERS GO UP. </p><p>IF FORCED TO CHOOSE, WE WOULD GUESS THAT ACTUAL STRENGTH </p><p>IS HIGHER THAN OFFICIALLY ESTIMATED, RATHER THAN LOWER. </p><p> </p><p>4. (LOU) INSURGENT GAME PLANS: THE TACTICS OF THESE </p><p>GROUPS HAVE TRADITIONALLY CONSISTED OF EXTORTION, </p><p>KIDNAPPING, AND AMBUSHES OF COLOMBIAN SECURITY FORCES. </p><p>THE AVAILABLITY OF NARCO MONEY IN RECENT YEARS MAY HAVE </p><p>REDUCED THE PROPORTIONATE ROLE OF EXTORTION IN TOTAL </p><p>GUERRILLA FINANCING.  URBAN TERRORISM REMAINS A PROBLEM, </p><p>BUT POLICE HAVE RECENTLY BEEN FAIRLY SUCCESSFUL IN </p><p>HUNTING DOWN TERRORIST SAFE HOUSES.  POSSIBLY AS A </p><p>RESULT, M-19 AND ITS ALLIES HAVE CONCENTRATED IN RECENT </p><p>MONTHS MAINLY ON RURAL OPERATIONS IN THE VALLE DEL CAUCA </p><p>(CALI) AREA.  AN IMPORTANT FACTOR SINCE LATE 1985 HAS </p><p>BEEN THE FORMATION OF AN ALLIANCE OF ALL THE GUERRILLA </p><p>GROUPS WHO ARE OUTSIDE THE PEACE PROCESS, INTO THE </p><p>NATIONAL GUERRILLA COORDINADORA (CNG).  THIS </p><p>ORGANIZATION, WHICH HAS BEEN DOMINATED BY M-19 TO THE </p><p>POINT THAT SOME GUERRILLAS HAVE THEMSELVES COMPLAINED, </p><p>HAS PROBABLY ENABLED THE GUERRILLAS TO MASS LARGER </p><p>NUMBERS FOR PARTICULAR ATTACKS THAN WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE </p><p>BEEN POSSIBLE.  SHOULD THE FARC ONE DAY LEAVE THE PEACE </p><p>PROCESS AND JOIN THE CNG, POSSIBILITIES WOULD OPEN FOR </p><p>EVEN LARGER-SCALE OPERATIONS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FARC: ENEMY NUMBER ONE </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C/NF) FARC -- PATIENT AND DISCIPLINED: WHETHER AS </p><p>PART OF THE CNG OR OTHERWISE, THE FARC REPRESENT </p><p>POTENTIALLY THE GREATEST DANGER TO THE COLOMBIAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT.  UNLIKE THE OTHER GUERRILLA GROUPS, THE </p><p>FARC\'S DEDICATION TO A REVOLUTIONARY TRIUMPH IS TEMPERED </p><p>BY PATIENCE AND DISCIPLINE.  THE FARC LEADERSHIP IS TOO </p><p>SOPHISTICATED TO EXPECT POWER BASED ON A SHORT-TERM </p><p>MILITARY VICTORY.  THIS ATTITUDE CONTRASTS WITH THAT OF </p><p>THE M-19, WHICH CONCENTRATES ON SPECTACULAR, BUT </p><p>ULTIMATELY COUNTER-PRODUCTIVE, ACTIONS SUCH AS THE </p><p>PALACE OF JUSTICE SEIZURE, THE ATTACK AGAINST THE CIUDAD </p><p>JARDIN SUBURB OF CALI, OR THE ATTEMPT TO ASSASSINATE THE </p><p>MINISTER OF GOVERNMENT.  THE KEY TO THE FARC\'S STRATEGY </p><p>APPEARS TO BE ITS PARTICIPATION IN THE PEACE PROCESS. </p><p>THE FARC HAS USED THE AMBIGUITIES OF THE PEACE TREATY TO </p><p>GAIN MORE RECRUITS, AS WELL AS INCREASED NUMBERS AND </p><p>TYPES OF WEAPONS, WHILE ALSO ACQUIRING SOME POLITICAL </p><p>RESPECTABILITY.  FARC LEADERS HAVE DEVOTED CONSIDERABLE </p><p>EFFORT TO CONSOLIDATING THEIR CONTROL IN AREAS UNDER </p><p>THEIR INFLUENCE.  THERE HAVE BEEN REPORTS OF FARC </p><p>ATTEMPTS TO REACH AGREEMENTS WITH THE ELN AND THE EPL IN </p><p>AREAS WHERE THEY COMPETE TO ENABLE JOINT OPERATIONS SUCH </p><p>THAT THE FARC\'S PARTICIPATION WOULD BE COVERT.  SUCH AN </p><p>ARRANGEMENT WOULD GIVE FARC LEADERS PLAUSIBLE DENIAL FOR </p><p>TERRORIST ACTS WHILE ALLOWING THEM TO MAINTAIN CONTROL </p><p>OF THEIR AREAS OF INFLUENCE.  MEANWHILE, COLOMBIAN </p><p>MILITARY SOURCES CLAIM THAT, OUT OF ANXIETY TO AVOID </p><p>BREAKING THE TRUCE, PRESIDENT BETANCUR ORDERED THE ARMED </p><p>FORCES NOT TO ENTER AREAS OF FARC ENCAMPMENTS.  THE FARC </p><p>HAS BEEN THE LEADER AMONG THE GUERRILLAS IN FORGING </p><p>HIGHLY PROFITABLE LINKS WITH THE NARCO-TRAFFICKERS, </p><p>WHOSE AREAS OF ACTIVITY ARE FREQUENTLY IN TRADITIONAL </p><p>FARC OPERATING AREAS.  IN VIEW OF THESE TANGIBLE </p><p>BENEFITS, THE FARC PROBABLY DESIRES TO MAINTAIN THE </p><p>PEACE PROCESS IN ITS PRESENT FORM. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C/NF) FARC-UP IN CONGRESS: PERHAPS THE GREATEST </p><p>BENEFIT ACHIEVED BY THE FARC IS THE MODICUM OF </p><p>RESPECTABILITY DERIVING FROM ITS ENTRY INTO COLOMBIAN </p><p>ELECTORAL POLITICS VIA ITS FRONT PARTY, THE PATRIOTIC </p><p>UNION (UP).  THOUGH THE UP\'S VOTE TOTAL WAS NOT </p><p>SPECTACULAR, THE PARTY HAS INJECTED THE FARC INTO </p><p>MAINSTREAM POLITICS.  REPORTING INDICATES THAT THE FARC </p><p>INTENDS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ITS SEVERAL SEATS IN </p><p>CONGRESS TO PRESS FOR A UNITED OPPOSITION FRONT TO THE </p><p>NEW BARCO GOVERNMENT.  SUCH A FRONT WOULD FEATURE </p><p>ALLIANCES WITH CONGRESSMEN FROM ANY PARTY OR BACKGROUND </p><p>DISAFFECTED WITH THE LIBERAL GOVERNMENT.  THE UNITED </p><p>FRONT IDEA IS OVER-AMBITIOUS BUT NOT TOO FAR-FETCHED. </p><p>ASSORTED LIBERALS AND NEW LIBERALS ALLIED READILY WITH </p><p>THE UP IN THE MARCH LEGISLATIVE ELECTIONS.  A "NEW </p><p>LIBERAL" LEADER SAID BEFORE THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION </p><p>THAT HIS PARTY WOULD SEEK TO RECOUP ITS STANDING BY </p><p>ALIGNING ITSELF WITH ANY PARTY IN THE CONGRESS, </p><p>INCLUDING THE UP.  THE UP/FARC LEADERS HOPE THIS </p><p>STRATEGY WILL EVENTUALLY MAKE THEIR GROUP THE LEADING </p><p>OPPOSITION FORCE IN COLOMBIA.  THEY WILL PUSH THE PUBLIC </p><p>ARGUMENT THAT THE TWO MAJOR PARTIES ARE MUTUALLY </p><p>COMPROMISED LOOK-ALIKES. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C/NF) FARC FALLBACK TO ARMS: EVEN WHILE IT PLAYS ITS </p><p>LEGAL POLITICAL "CARD," THE FARC HAS NOT LOST SIGHT OF </p><p>ITS AMBITION TO ACHIEVE PRIMACY AMONG COLOMBIA\'S </p><p>GUERRILLA FACTIONS.  THE FARC LEADERSHIP MAY BE </p><p>CONSIDERING JOINING THE CNG.  THE GOAL OF SUCH A MOVE </p><p>WOULD MOST LIKELY BE TO DOMINATE ALL COLOMBIA\'S </p><p>GUERRILLA MOVEMENTS, SUBJECT THEM TO FARC/COMMUNIST </p><p>PARTY DISCIPLINE, AND LEAD THEM BACK INTO THE PEACE </p><p>PROCESS.  FARC LEADERS PRIVATELY ARGUE THAT ALL GROUPS </p><p>COULD CONTINUE MILITARY OPERATIONS WHILE INSIDE THE </p><p>PEACE PROCESS, DENY RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEM, AND THEREBY </p><p>ATTAIN A MEASURE OF PROTECTION AGAINST COLOMBIAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT ACTIONS -- AS THE FARC HAS DONE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>M-19: VIOLENCE IN A VACUUM </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (C/NF) SEEKING ATTENTION, FACING ATTRITION: WHILE THE </p><p>FARC POSES THE GREATEST LONG-TERM THREAT TO COLOMBIA, </p><p>THE 19TH OF APRIL MOVEMENT (M-19) CONTINUES TO DOMINATE </p><p>THE HEADLINES BOTH IN COLOMBIA AND ELSEWHERE.  THE </p><p>M-19\'S RECENT HISTORY IS REPLETE WITH GROSS </p><p>MISCALCULATIONS.  THE CONTINUING ATTRITION OF THE M-19\'S </p><p>LEADERSHIP, REPRESENTED BY THE DEATHS OF MEN SUCH AS </p><p>JAIME BATEMAN THREE YEARS AGO, IVAN MARINO OSPINA IN </p><p>CALI IN AUGUST 1985, ANDRES ALMARALES IN THE PALACE OF </p><p>JUSTICE SIEGE LAST NOVEMBER, AND ALVARO FAYAD IN A MARCH </p><p>1986 BOGOTA FIGHT, HAS LEFT THE MOVEMENT WITH MANY </p><p>PISTOLEROS BUT FEW POLITICALLY ASTUTE CHIEFS.  M-19\'S </p><p>CONTINUED ATTEMPTS TO GO FOR THE ELUSIVE KNOCKOUT, WITH </p><p>ACTIONS LIKE THE SEIZURE OF THE PALACE OF JUSTICE AND </p><p>THE CIUDAD JARDIN ATTACK, SHOW THE UNREALITY OF ITS </p><p>POLITICAL CALCULATIONS.  AS A RESULT, ITS POPULAR </p><p>SUPPORT -- WHICH WAS ONCE QUITE LARGE (IN A 1981 OPINION </p><p>POLL, 40 PERCENT NATIONALLY EXPRESSED "SOME SYMPATHY" </p><p>FOR M-19) -- IS DECLINING. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C/NF) LEADING FROM WEAKNESS?: SEVERAL ACTIONS ATTEST </p><p>TO THE M-19\'S INFLATED SENSE OF ITS CAPABILITIES.  THE </p><p>FORMATION OF THE INTERNATIONALIST "AMERICAS BATTALION" </p><p>IN DECEMBER 1985 WAS AN OSTENSIBLE ATTEMPT TO FORM A NEW </p><p>"BOLIVARIAN ARMY" TO LIBERATE ANEW THE ANDEAN </p><p>COUNTRIES.  BUT THE AMERICAS BATTALION HAS NOT ENJOYED </p><p>MUCH SUCCESS IN ITS CHOSEN THEATER, THE CAUCA VALLEY. </p><p>DESPITE THEIR WEAKNESS IN NUMBERS, THE M-19 LEADERSHIP </p><p>CONTINUES TO PLAN TO ESTABLISH AN ALTERNATE GOVERNMENT </p><p>IN VALLE DEL CAUCA DEPARTMENT AND CONVENE A NATIONAL </p><p>"CONGRESS" THERE IN AUGUST 1986.  THE M-19 HAS SAID IT </p><p>WILL NOT RPT NOT SEEK AN ACCOMMODATION WITH THE BARCO </p><p>REGIME, BUT WILL CONTINUE ITS OPERATIONS AS USUAL. </p><p>(ATTEMPTS TO SEEK PAPAL MEDIATION, IN THE NEWS LATELY, </p><p>WERE ALMOST CERTAINLY MADE WITH THE EXPECTATION THAT </p><p>THEY WOULD FAIL IMMEDIATELY.  THEY WERE PUBLICITY </p><p>GESTURES ONLY.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PROBLEMS OF THE COLOMBIAN ARMED FORCES </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (C/NF) RESOURCES THINLY STRETCHED: AS IT PREPARES </p><p>FOR A SITUATION WHICH MAY CHANGE CONSIDERABLY OVER THE </p><p>NEXT YEAR, THE COLOMBIAN ARMED FORCES CONFRONT SEVERAL </p><p>MAJOR PROBLEMS.  ONE IS A SHORTAGE OF PERSONNEL: THE </p><p>COLOMBIAN ARMY TOTALS ABOUT 70,000 MEN.  GIVEN THE </p><p>GEOGRAPHIC SPREAD OF THE GUERRILLA FORCES, THE </p><p>INHOSPITABLE TERRAIN, THE NEED TO DEFEND MANY FIXED </p><p>HIGH-VALUE TARGETS, AND THE SHORTAGE OF DEPLOYABLE </p><p>FORCES, THE ARMY IS ALREADY STRETCHED THIN.  SHOULD THE </p><p>PEACE PROCESS UNRAVEL AND THE FARC RESUME THE ATTACK, </p><p>THE ARMY WOULD BE HARD PRESSED.  ONE GENERAL OFFICER </p><p>SPECULATED THAT 15,000 ADDITIONAL TROOPS WOULD BE </p><p>REQUIRED, SHOULD THE FARC SHIFT TO A WAR FOOTING. </p><p> </p><p>11. (C/NF) SEEING THROUGH A GLASS DARKLY: LACK OF </p><p>INTELLIGENCE IS ANOTHER MAJOR PROBLEM FOR COLOMBIAN </p><p>MILITARY PERFORMANCE.  ALTHOUGH THE ARMY HAS CONDUCTED </p><p>OPERATIONS FOR SEVERAL MONTHS AGAINST THE AMERICAS </p><p>BATTALION IN VALLE DEL CAUCA AND CAUCA DEPARTMENTS, THE </p><p>LACK OF GOOD AND READILY AVAILABLE MILITARY INTELLIGENCE </p><p>PREVENTS A CLEAR PICTURE OF THE SITUATION.  AT LEAST IN </p><p>THIS THEATER, THE ARMY APPEARS BOGGED DOWN AND UNABLE TO </p><p>BRING ITS CONCENTRATED STRENGTH TO BEAR.  THE POLICE </p><p>(MORE THAN 60,000 STRONG, AND PARA-MILITARY) ALSO PLAY A </p><p>LARGE ROLE IN COUNTER-INSURGENCY IN ALL AREAS, BUT </p><p>PARTICULARLY IN THE CITIES.  INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION </p><p>APPEARS MORE AVAILABLE IN THE CITIES, AND GUERRILLA </p><p>OPERATIONS THERE HAVE BEEN HURT RECENTLY. </p><p> </p><p>12. (C/NF) ARMS SHORTFALLS:  QUALITY OF EQUIPMENT IS YET </p><p>ANOTHER ISSUE.  GOC OFFICERS ARE CONVINCED THAT THE </p><p>QUALITY OF ARMS IN THE HANDS OF THE GUERRILLAS, </p><p>PARTICULARLY THE FARC, ACTUALLY EXCEEDS THAT OF THE </p><p>ARMY\'S WEAPONS.  GIVEN THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES AVAILABLE </p><p>TO THE GUERRILLAS THROUGH EXTORTION AND NARCOTICS, THEIR </p><p>ABILITY TO PURCHASE SUCH ARMS IS UNQUESTIONED.  SOME </p><p>COLOMBIAN OFFICERS FEEL THAT THE GAP CAN BE BEST </p><p>ADDRESSED THROUGH THE APPLICATION OF TECHNOLOGY, </p><p>STRESSING IN PARTICULAR THE USE OF MORE HELICOPTERS TO </p><p>PROVIDE LIFT AND MOBILITY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>THE YEAR AHEAD: DRAWING THE BATTLE LINES </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) SLIPPING STALEMATE?: THE PRESENT MILITARY </p><p>SITUATION IS IN MANY RESPECTS A STALEMATE.  THE </p><p>COLOMBIAN ARMY IS UNABLE TO DEFEAT THE GUERRILLAS </p><p>CURRENTLY RANGED AGAINST IT.  FOR THEIR PART, THE </p><p>GUERRILLAS ARE UNABLE TO MAKE INROADS AGAINST THE </p><p>CENTRAL GOVERNMENT IN AREAS OF DENSE SETTLEMENT, BUT ARE </p><p>EXPANDING IN SOME ISOLATED RURAL REGIONS -- PARTICULARLY </p><p>WHERE THEY ALREADY HAVE TRADITIONAL SUPPORT.  THE </p><p>CONVENTIONAL WISDOM HOLDS THAT A GOVERNMENT IS LOSING </p><p>WHEN MERELY KEEPING AN INSURGENCY AT BAY.  THE SHIFT IN </p><p>STRENGTH MAY BE GLACIAL, BUT OVER TIME THE DECAY OF THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S POSITION IS REAL.  THERE ARE MORE </p><p>GUERRILLAS ACTIVE NOW IN COLOMBIA, AND THE LEVEL OF </p><p>POLITICAL VIOLENCE IS HIGHER, THAN AT ANY TIME SINCE THE </p><p>CIVIL WAR OF THE 1950\'S -- BUT DURING THAT WAR, MOST </p><p>GUERRILLAS WERE LIBERALS, NOT COMMUNISTS.  THE SITUATION </p><p>IS NO CAUSE FOR PANIC.  THE NUMBER OF GUERRILLAS IS </p><p>SMALL IN PROPORTION TO THE SIZE OF THE COUNTRY, AND </p><p>COLOMBIANS CAN TOLERATE A LOT OF VIOLENCE.  BUT IT CAN </p><p>SCARCELY PROMOTE EASY SLUMBER FOR COLOMBIAN LEADERS. </p><p> </p><p>14. (C/NF) THE COMING YEAR:  AS THE PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>INAUGURATION APPROACHES, ALL PARTIES TO THE CONFLICT </p><p>ANTICIPATE CHANGES IN THE PRESENT REALITY.  IN PRIVATE </p><p>TALKS AND IN HIS SIX-POINT PEACE PROGRAM, </p><p>PRESIDENT-ELECT BARCO HAS SERVED NOTICE THAT THE PEACE </p><p>PROCESS MUST AND WILL CHANGE.  THE ARMED FORCES CHIEF OF </p><p>STAFF EXPECTS AN INEVITABLE (BUT PROBABLY GRADUAL) </p><p>INCREASE IN GUERRILLA ACTIVITY AFTER THE INAUGURATION, </p><p>AS THE GUERRILLAS REACT TO BARCO\'S HARDER LINE.  THE </p><p>PAYOFF WOULD, HOPEFULLY, COME IN A YEAR OR TWO WHEN THE </p><p>GUERRILLAS HAVE EITHER LAID DOWN THEIR ARMS OR BEEN </p><p>DEALT WITH FORCEFULLY.  BOTH MILITARY AND CIVILIAN </p><p>LEADERS HAVE EXPRESSED TO US THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL </p><p>RESOURCES TO MEET THIS EXPECTED UPTURN IN GUERRILLA </p><p>ATTACKS.  WHILE CONTINUED AND EVEN EXPANDED ACTIVITIES </p><p>BY GROUPS SUCH AS THE M-19, ELN, AND EPL, SEEM </p><p>INEVITABLE, THE WILD CARD REMAINS THE FARC.  MANUEL </p><p>MARULANDA VELEZ (AKA TIROFIJO), TOP LEADER OF THE FARC, </p><p>HAS HINTED THAT THE GROUP WILL NOT ACCEPT AN ATTEMPT BY </p><p>BARCO TO CHANGE THE RULES OF THE GAME.  IN AN INTERVIEW </p><p>PUBLISHED IN THE COLOMBIAN WEEKLY "SEMANA," TIROFIJO </p><p>DECLARED THAT THE FARC WILL NOT ACCEPT ULTIMATUMS FROM </p><p>THE BARCO GOVERNMENT, VIEWING SUCH DEMANDS AS AN ATTEMPT </p><p>TO RUPTURE THE PEACE PROCESS.  HE ALSO DECLARED THAT HIS </p><p>GUERRILLAS WOULD NOT DEMOBILIZE UNLESS THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>IMPLEMENTED THE FULL RANGE OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL </p><p>REFORMS DEMANDED BY THE FARC.  HIS STATEMENT AGREES WITH </p><p>REALITY, AS WE SEE IT FOR THE FARC: WITHOUT GUNS, THE </p><p>FARC WOULD BE A NEGLIGIBLE MINI-PARTY.  WITHOUT GUNS, </p><p>THEY WOULD HAVE NO ATTRACTION FOR NARCO MONEY.  WITHOUT </p><p>GUNS, THEY WOULD SWIFTLY FADE FROM PUBLIC ATTENTION.  WE </p><p>CONCLUDE THAT, THEREFORE, THEY WILL FIND A PRETEXT TO </p><p>KEEP THE GUNS.  THE SPARRING HAS BEGUN.  OVER THE COURSE </p><p>OF THE YEAR FOLLOWING THE AUGUST 7 INAUGURATION, WE </p><p>THINK THE FIGHT BETWEEN THE GOC AND ITS GUERRILLA </p><p>ENEMIES WILL GET HOTTER BEFORE IT GETS COLDER. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GILLESPIE </p><p></p></div>
