<p>CONFIDENTIAL ROME 001797 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>ALMATY FOR EMBASSY DUSHANBE </p><p>NSC FOR KHALILZHAD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/10/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINS, AF, PINS, AF, IT, ITPREL, AFGHANISTAN </p><p>SUBJECT: AFGHANISTAN:  ALL SYSTEMS (STILL) GO FOR FORMER </p><p>KING\'S RETURN </p><p> </p><p>REF: ROME 1774 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: POL MINCOUNS TOM COUNTRYMAN, REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  SUMMARY:  THE SON-IN-LAW TO THE FORMER AFGHAN KING </p><p>SAID THREATS AND DISTURBANCES WILL NOT DETER THE KING AND HIS </p><p>PARTY FROM THEIR RETURN TO AFGHANISTAN.  THEY ARE PLEASED </p><p>WITH ARRANGEMENTS BEING MADE BY ITALY IN CONSULTATION WITH </p><p>THE AIA, THEY REMAIN IN CLOSE TOUCH WITH CHAIRMAN KARZAI, AND </p><p>ALL SYSTEMS ARE GO FOR THE RETURN.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  IN A MARCH 9 CONVERSATION WITH POLOFF, GENERAL ABDUL </p><p>WALI, SON-IN-LAW AND ADVISER TO FORMER AFGHAN KING ZAHIR </p><p>SHAH, SAID SECURITY ARRANGEMENTS AND ALL OTHER LOGISTICAL </p><p>PREPARATIONS FOR THE KING\'S APRIL 17 RETURN ARE WELL UNDERWAY </p><p>AND ARE SATISFACTORY TO THE KING AND HIS ENTOURAGE. </p><p>EVERYTHING IS MOVING FORWARD APPROPRIATELY, WALI SAID, AND </p><p>THE GROUP IS ANTICIPATING THEIR ARRIVAL IN KABUL.  WALI\'S </p><p>BROTHER, WALI SHAH, WHO WILL ALSO JOIN THE KING\'S HOMECOMING, </p><p>AND EXECUTIVE SECRETARY HAMED SIDIQ MADE THE SAME POINT TO </p><p>POLOFF IN SEPARATE CONVERSATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01797  01 OF 02  102345Z </p><p>3.  (C)  WALI HAD CONCLUDED A CONVERSATION WITH MFA SPECIAL </p><p>COORDINATOR FOR AFGHANISTAN ENRICO DI MAIO SHORTLY BEFORE </p><p>POLOFF\'S CALL, AND SAID DI MAIO HAD REFERRED TO ITALY\'S APRIL </p><p>16 GENERAL STRIKE BUT HAD NOT CHANGED THE DATE FOR THE KING\'S </p><p>DEPARTURE.  (COMMENT:  WALI WAS REFRESHINGLY CAREFUL ABOUT </p><p>NOT STATING THE EXPECTED DATE OF THE KING\'S DEPARTURE ON THE </p><p>TELEPHONE -- A FIRST SINCE THIS PROCESS BEGAN.)  DI MAIO HAD </p><p>DISCUSSED DIFFERENT "STAGING AREAS" WITH WALI, TIMING FOR </p><p>DEPARTURE, AND THE ARRIVAL OF AIA CHAIRMAN KARZAI, FINALIZING </p><p>DETAILS FOR THE RETURN. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  AS NOTED REFTEL, DI MAIO TOLD WALI THE GOI WOULD </p><p>COORDINATE THE KING\'S SECURITY UNTIL ZAHIR SHAH LANDS IN </p><p>KABUL, BUT THAT GOI SECURITY EXPERTS WOULD REMAIN IN KABUL </p><p>FOR SOME TIME THEREAFTER TO ADVISE AFGHAN PROTECTIVE FORCES. </p><p>POLOFF ASKED IF THIS ARRANGEMENT WAS SATISFACTORY, AND WALI </p><p>SAID YES.  WAS THE KING ALSO SATISFIED?  "YES, FULLY," WALI </p><p>REPLIED.  WALI ELABORATED THAT THE PROTECTION WOULD BE </p><p>PROVIDED BY AFGHANS TRAINED BY "DIFFERENT EUROPEAN </p><p>COUNTRIES," INCLUDING ITALY.  "THEY ARE AFGHANS WE SELECTED," </p><p>HE SAID, "BUT THE REAL SELECTION WILL NOT TAKE PLACE UNTIL I </p><p>AM IN AFGHANISTAN AND CHOOSE THEM MYSELF."  WALI WOULD SELECT </p><p>"PEOPLE OF PROVEN LOYALTY," BUT NOT ONLY PASHTUNS.  "THEY </p><p>WILL BE LARGELY PASHTUNS BECAUSE PASHTUNS ARE THE LARGEST </p><p>ETHNIC GROUP," HE OBSERVED. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  WALI REPORTED THE KING TO BE STILL LOOKING FORWARD </p><p>TO HIS RETURN AND LARGELY UNFAZED BY THE DELAYS.  ALTHOUGH </p><p>ZAHIR SHAH HAD A "SLIGHT INFLUENZA" AND WAS TAKING </p><p>ANTIBIOTICS, THERE WOULD BE NO FURTHER DELAY OF HIS RETURN, </p><p>"BARRING SOMETHING UNFORESEEN."  WALI EXPRESSED THE HOPE THAT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01797  01 OF 02  102345Z </p><p>THE SITUATION IN THE MIDDLE EAST WOULD EASE, AS THAT </p><p>INCREASES OVERALL DANGER, BUT AGAIN ASSERTED THAT "DELAYING </p><p>IS OVER."  POLOFF NOTED THE RECENT ATTEMPT AGAINST DEFENSE </p><p>MINISTER FAHIM.  WALI EXPRESSED DISAPPOINTMENT THAT THE </p><p>ATTACK HAD OCCURRED, BUT SAID THE BOMBINGS AND DISTURBANCES </p><p>WERE "NOT IMPORTANT" IN THE CONTEXT OF THE KING\'S RETURN.  IF </p><p>THEY WERE MEANT TO DETER ZAHIR SHAH, "THEN SOMEONE MADE A </p><p>MISTAKE ANALYZING THE KING\'S CHARACTER," WALI ASSERTED </p><p>STRONGLY.  "HIS MAJESTY HAS A WILL OF IRON."  ZAHIR SHAH WILL </p><p>RETURN, WALI CONCLUDED FORCEFULLY. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  DESPITE HIS CARE IN DISCUSSING THE DATE FOR THE </p><p>KING\'S RETURN, WALI TOLD POLOFF CHAIRMAN KARZAI WOULD ARRIVE </p><p>IN ROME ON APRIL 16 IN THE AFTERNOON, WALI BELIEVED STILL </p><p>USING THE LOANED AIRCRAFT OF THE AGHA KHAN.  FOREIGN MINISTER </p><p>ABDULLAH, CIVIL AVIATION MINISTER "AND OUR FRIEND" ZALMAI </p><p>RASSOUL, AND RECONSTRUCTION MINISTER FARHANG WOULD JOIN </p><p>KARZAI, AS WALI UNDERSTOOD.  THE KING AND WALI REMAINED IN </p><p>CLOSE COMMUNICATION WITH CHAIRMAN KARZAI AND LOOKED FORWARD </p><p>TO PROVIDING HIM THEIR SUPPORT.  UNPROMPTED, WALI OBSERVED </p><p>THAT KARZAI WAS DOING A GOOD JOB AS CHAIRMAN. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ6988 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  01797  02 OF 02  102346Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   CIAE-00  DODE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EAP-00   EB-00 </p><p>      VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    L-00     AC-01 </p><p>      NEA-00   NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   PA-00    PM-00 </p><p>      PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SCT-00   SP-00    SS-00    TRSE-00 </p><p>      T-00     USIE-00  SA-00    ASDS-01  PMB-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02 </p><p>      G-00     SAS-00     /008W </p><p>                  ------------------823931  102346Z /30 </p><p>P 101403Z APR 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 3202 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY ISLAMABAD PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY KABUL PRIORITY </p><p>AMCONSUL PESHAWAR PRIORITY </p><p>NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY ALMATY </p><p>AMEMBASSY ANKARA </p><p>AMEMBASSY ASHGABAT </p><p>AMEMBASSY BEIJING </p><p>AMEMBASSY BERLIN </p><p>AMEMBASSY LONDON </p><p>AMEMBASSY MOSCOW </p><p>AMEMBASSY NEW DELHI </p><p>AMEMBASSY PARIS </p><p>AMEMBASSY TASHKENT </p><p> </p><p></p><p> </p><p>ALMATY FOR EMBASSY DUSHANBE </p><p>NSC FOR KHALILZHAD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/10/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINS, AF, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: AFGHANISTAN:  ALL SYSTEMS (STILL) GO FOR FORMER </p><p>KING\'S RETURN </p><p> </p><p>7.
