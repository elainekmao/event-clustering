<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 001875 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: AEMR, AMGT, ASEC, CASC, CVIS, EFIN, ETRD, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZO1: AMMAN SITREP 18 (3/29 1100 LOCAL) </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) FBIS EUP20030328000120 </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>General Overview </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) The Embassy is closed March 29 for the Jordanian </p><p>weekend.  It will open for regular business on Sunday, March </p><p>30.  The movement of American staff remains restricted. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>Consular Issues </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Embassy\'s Crisis Liaison Unit received e-mail from </p><p>Task Force 1, CA with information that the Iraqi Government </p><p>is planning to expel from Baghdad a Christian Peacemaker Team </p><p>with five Amcits this morning (3/29), along with two other </p><p>Amcits.  Group expects to travel along the Baghdad-Amman </p><p>highway and is concerned they may be fired on.  Information </p><p>has been passed on to Task Force West personnel in the </p><p>Embassy. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>GOJ Actions/Statements </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) FM Marwan Muasher, in a 3/28 interview with the </p><p>Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera (ref A), reiterated </p><p>that "there have not been, there are not, and there will not </p><p>be any attacks on Iraq from our territory or from our air </p><p>space.  The rumors circulating in that sense are false." </p><p>While acknowledging that U.S. soldiers are in the Kingdom </p><p>manning Patriot missile batteries, and for logistics and </p><p>defensive operations, Muasher stated "there are no troops </p><p>preparing offensive operations against Iraq.  I rule that out </p><p>categorically and I challenge anyone to provide proof to the </p><p>contrary."  On political relations with the U.S., Muasher </p><p>noted "we have differences, including of a substantial </p><p>nature, with the United States with this war, but our </p><p>relations with Washington are solid and strong, both on the </p><p>political and on the economic level.  No one can question </p><p>that."  On the outcome of the current situation, Muasher </p><p>stated "There is no doubt about who is going to win this war, </p><p>but a military victory is not necessarily a political </p><p>victory.  The thought of imposing democracy in the Arab world </p><p>is infantile.  Democracy is built up through participation; </p><p>Iraq must belong to the Iraqis." </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>Security </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) No new issues </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>Economic and Trade Developments </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) No new issues. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>Refugee/Humanitarian Issues </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) No new issues. </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>Press </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) At approximately 0100, Embassy Press Officer was </p><p>contacted by Lisa Barron of CBS Radio, who said that five of </p><p>the journalists who had gone missing from Baghdad in recent </p><p>days had arrived in Syria, and one had arrived in Jordan. </p><p>According to Barron, she had received information that Molly </p><p>Bingham (Amcit freelance photographer), Matthew McAllester </p><p>(UK citizen and Newsday journalist), Moises Saman (Spanish </p><p>citizen and Newsday photographer), Philip Robert Latasa </p><p>(Amcit peace activist) and Johan Deng Spanner (Danish </p><p>photographer) had safely arrived in Syria.  She also reported </p><p>that Nate Thayer (Amcit journalist for Esquire and Slate.com) </p><p>had arrived in Jordan.
