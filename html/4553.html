<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 003212 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O.12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINS, EAID, MASS, PHUM, MCAP, NI </p><p>SUBJECT:  NIGERIAN ARMY PREVENTS KADUNA FROM BEING A </p><p>GREATER TRAGEDY </p><p> </p><p>USDAO Abuja 3201 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary:  Nigeria\'s Army bears an international </p><p>reputation for poor professional standards and for </p><p>committing human rights violations.  In Nigeria, that </p><p>reputation is more nuanced, less negative.  Of course, </p><p>Nigerians know too well that soldiers often commit abuses. </p><p>But they equally realize their Army is, in the last resort, </p><p>the best surety of social order as well as the first choice </p><p>for safe haven during bouts of communal violence.  The </p><p>recent communal violence in Kaduna, where the Army restored </p><p>order, gave refuge to thousands, and perhaps saved hundreds </p><p>of lives in the process, showed the other face of the </p><p>Nigerian Army.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  "Muslims and Christians armed with daggers and machetes </p><p>rioted in two Nigerian cities Friday, burning cars and </p><p>attacking bystanders in a third day of violence over the </p><p>Miss World pageant.  About 100 people have been killed and </p><p>500 injured, Red Cross officials said Friday. ... </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>\'The soldiers have been very helpful, giving us bandages </p><p>and first aid.  Everyone is here -- Muslims, Christians and </p><p>pagan.  We are all afraid of going home,\' said Habiba </p><p>Ibrahim, who spent the night in the city\'s defense academy </p><p>near the government clinic where she works. ..." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(International Herald Tribune, 23-24 November, page one) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  The November 25 edition of "Vanguard" reports 250 dead </p><p>and 6,006 families displaced.  If each displaced family has </p><p>six members, approximately 36,000 persons fled their homes </p><p>during last week\'s violence.  Unconfirmed reports claim the </p><p>death toll may exceed 500; one eyewitness reported the </p><p>burial of 420 Christians.  Kaduna suffered two episodes of </p><p>deadly communal violence in early 2000 (February and May), </p><p>with a combined death toll estimated in the low thousands. </p><p>Then as now, thousands of families took refuge in military </p><p>facilities.  The Embassy cannot independently assess the </p><p>accuracy of any estimate of the victims of this latest </p><p>round of communal unrest to rock ethnically and religiously </p><p>diverse Kaduna. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  Of one thing we are certain.  But for the presence of </p><p>the Nigerian Army, the numbers -- whatever they may be -- </p><p>would have been higher.  Worried about his family\'s safety, </p><p>an employee of one Mission member traveled to Kaduna on 22 </p><p>November.  He found his home vandalized, each cushion in it </p><p>slashed -- but his family safe in a nearby Army barracks. </p><p>They had fled moments before the attackers arrived. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  Monday\'s "Vanguard" shows the breakdown of displaced </p><p>families by location.  77 percent of them (4630 of 6006) </p><p>are sheltering at military and police installations. </p><p>Relatively few even sought refuge in other public </p><p>facilities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  Nigerian base/facility commanders have a long tradition </p><p>of opening their gates to those fleeing communal violence, </p><p>regardless of religion or ethnic group.  Those who would </p><p>inflict violence on their fellow citizens have a history of </p><p>not attempting to pursue their would-be victims onto the </p><p>military bases, even though most bases lack robust </p><p>perimeter security. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  Mobs have less respect for police stations, and reports </p><p>of them being overrun during riots are common.  The police </p><p>are not as well armed, nor are they as respected or feared, </p><p>as the Army.  During unrest in Abuja November 22, several </p><p>police vehicles were burned, and eyewitnesses reported </p><p>seeing one mob beat up a lone policeman and another mob </p><p>disarm a policeman who either held his fire in the face of </p><p>machetes and rocks or had not been issued bullets. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  While a considerable number of families took refuge at </p><p>police facilities in Kaduna (1357 versus 3273 on military </p><p>bases), the high concentration of large police facilities </p><p>in that city is unusual.  In many parts of the country, the </p><p>only place where the persecuted can feel safe is a military </p><p>base. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  It is impossible to estimate the additional numbers of </p><p>people who would have died in Kaduna last week if base </p><p>commanders had not given refuge, nor for that matter can we </p><p>to begin to imagine the number of lives this practice has </p><p>saved over the years.  It is safe to say, however, that </p><p>both numbers would be substantial. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  Meanwhile, in several parts of the country, notably in </p><p>and around Jos, Plateau\'s capital city, most citizens want </p><p>the permanent joint task forces (Police/Military) to remain </p><p>in place for the foreseeable future.  Whatever the human </p><p>rights lapses of GON security forces, the public has more </p><p>fear of armed robbers and violent, unruly mobs. </p><p>12.  Comment:  The events of last week prove that Nigeria </p><p>is often a harsh place.  Politics, ethnicity and religion </p><p>are tightly intertwined and frustration born of poverty is </p><p>ever present.  An otherwise insignificant incident can </p><p>spiral into a violent expression of inter-ethnic rancor. </p><p>In too many areas of the country, eruption of communal </p><p>violence is just an affront, a shove or minor traffic </p><p>accident away.  There have been times when the misconduct </p><p>of soldiers has contributed to the tension and unnecessary </p><p>violence.  Frequently, however, it is the Army that </p><p>restores order and provides shelter to people who would </p><p>have been further victimized.  Because of the Army\'s </p><p>generally positive reputation in moments of communal </p><p>violence, many people willingly ran to the safety of the </p><p>various military facilities around Kaduna.  The USG is </p><p>starting programs to build the capacity and professional </p><p>caliber of Nigeria\'s Police.  For the foreseeable future, </p><p>however, the Army alone will be able to restore order when </p><p>it breaks down massively. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ANDREWS </p><p></p></div>
