(SBU) Summary: Three WFP successfully crossed the </p><p>Turkish-Iraqi border on 29 March and continued on to a UN </p><p>warehouse in northern Iraq.  Two UNICEF trucks carrying </p><p>non-food items are currently on the border awaiting clearance </p><p>to cross.  In another development, the Ministry of Foreign </p><p>Affairs (MFA) presented a Note Verbale to the UN Resident </p><p>Coordinator on 28 March requesting information on UN </p><p>employees involved in humanitarian activities in Turkey, and </p><p>asking that the UN in Turkey not employ individuals who had </p><p>recently worked in Iraq.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) On 29 March three WFP trucks with 60 metric tons of </p><p>wheat, soy and milk powder crossed the Turkish-Iraqi border. </p><p>WFP had not received all the proper clearances from the </p><p>government of Turkey, and there was a three day delay in </p><p>crossing.  Clearances were received on 28 March and, after </p><p>spending three hours at Turkish customs, the trucks crossed </p><p>the border and traveled on to a WFP warehouse in Dohuk. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) WFP will begin loading a shipment of 1,000 metric tons </p><p>(approximately 50 trucks) of wheat flour for northern Iraq on </p><p>31 March.  Paperwork for this shipment has already been </p><p>submitted to the MFA and the Coordination Center in </p><p>Diyarbakir.  WFP feels that this should avoid delays.  This </p><p>is a critical shipment to start important food flows into </p><p>northern Iraq.  This particular shipment is targeted for </p><p>Dohuk, where WFP has determined there is a shortage of wheat </p><p>flour.  Prior to the outbreak of war, the majority of Iraq </p><p>received multiple rations of flour, while the Kurdish area </p><p>received only multiple rations of vegetable oil.  The </p><p>shipment currently being loaded will be part of 6,000 metric </p><p>tons that the MFA has approved for WFP to bring into Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Two UNICEF trucks carrying non-food items arrived at </p><p>the Turkish-Iraqi border on 30 March.  The trucks are </p><p>awaiting clearance to cross the border.  UNICEF reported to </p><p>DART staff currently in southeast Turkey that they have </p><p>approximately 400 truckloads worth of medicines, emergency </p><p>supplies (blankets, tents, mattresses, hygiene kits, kitchen </p><p>sets, clothes, water treatment equipment and school </p><p>supplies).  Two hundred of those trucks are in Mersin. </p><p>UNICEF states that all of these commodities are enough to </p><p>assist one-third of Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) The MFA presented a Note Verbale on 28 March to the </p><p>United Nations Resident Coordinator requesting that he </p><p>provide the MFA with information on UN personnel involved in </p><p>humanitarian operations in Turkey.  The Resident Coordinator </p><p>is to provide identity particulars, dates of arrival in </p><p>Turkey, whether the personnel have residence and employment </p><p>permits, what countries the employees have served in, and the </p><p>particular function of the employees. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) The Note Verbale goes on to say quote it would also </p><p>be appreciated if the UN agencies could kindly avoid </p><p>employing personnel who have recently served in Iraq unquote. </p><p> While this may affect the whole UN structure in Turkey, it </p><p>has a great effect on WFP.  WFP currently employs a large </p><p>number of individuals with previous experience in Iraq, </p><p>including the newly-arrived WFP Emergency Coordinator.  The </p><p>UN is discussing how to respond to the Note. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) Comment: In a 28 March conversation with the MDRO, </p><p>MFA implied that the GOT would not go after all UN staff in </p><p>Turkey with recent experience in Iraq, but they did register </p><p>a definite objection to the assignment of a new Emergency </p><p>Coordinator, who most recently served in Erbil. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
