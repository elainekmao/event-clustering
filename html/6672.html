<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 001735 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARN, NEA/PA, NEA/AIA, INR/NESA, R/MR, </p><p>I/GNEA, B/BXN, B/BRN, NEA/PPD, NEA/IPA FOR ALTERMAN </p><p>USAID/ANE/MEA </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH </p><p>PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p> </p><p>TAGS: KMDR JO </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON WAR ON IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>                        Summary </p><p> </p><p>-- Lead stories in all papers today, March 23, </p><p>continue to focus on the war on Iraq.  Wire service </p><p>reports appeared under banner headlines highlighting </p><p>"resistance" encountered by coalition forces, civilian </p><p>casualties and growing anti-war protests.  Headlines </p><p>in several papers refer to Iraqis killed to date as </p><p>"martyrs."  One paper featured a graphic color </p><p>photograph (from Al Jazeera television) of a child </p><p>with his head blown apart.  Papers also carried color </p><p>photos of a burning Baghdad.  Another lead story </p><p>focuses on King Abdullah\'s meeting with the Jordanian </p><p>Cabinet, during which he expressed satisfaction with </p><p>his government\'s efforts to maintain order and </p><p>security, while calling for sympathetic treatment for </p><p>those demonstrating against the war. </p><p> </p><p>                 Editorial Commentary </p><p> </p><p>-- "Who picks up the war bill?" </p><p> </p><p>Centrist, influential among the elite English daily </p><p>Jordan Times (03/23) editorializes:  "U.S. President </p><p>George W. Bush and British Prime Minister Tony Blair </p><p>have publicly stated their long-term commitment to the </p><p>rebuilding of Iraq on several occasions.  But they </p><p>have been less than transparent with their own </p><p>constituencies on what that means, especially on a </p><p>financial level.  The United States has a long record </p><p>of forsaking countries which it entered as a </p><p>`liberator\'.  The last such example is Afghanistan, </p><p>where Washington\'s promises of aid, progress and </p><p>prosperity are still light-years away from </p><p>materializing.  As a politician, Bush cannot afford to </p><p>leave a mess in Iraq.  But, put aside his chances for </p><p>re-election, the United States at this stage does not </p><p>look like a country capable of taking care of itself, </p><p>let alone Iraq..  The Bush administration has over the </p><p>past few days craftily avoided questions on how much </p><p>the war alone would cost.  It might be a long time, if </p><p>ever, before Washington spells out how much exactly it </p><p>thinks to commit to piece Iraq back together." </p><p> </p><p>-- "A war, not a `crusade\'" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Bater Wardam writes on the back page </p><p>of center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(03/23):  "President George Bush may be using many </p><p>religious phrases and words in his speeches, and he </p><p>may be personally under the impression that he is </p><p>fulfilling a `sacred mission\' authorized to him by </p><p>`god\' when he launches war on Iraq.  The fact is, </p><p>however, Bush is fulfilling a mission given to him by </p><p>the lobby of the oil companies, such as those of </p><p>Cheney and Rice, to control the Iraqi oil, by the </p><p>hawks of the military industry, such as Rumsfeld, </p><p>Powell and Wolfowitz, to effect an American military </p><p>hegemony over the world, and finally by the right-wing </p><p>Zionist Lobby, such as Richard Pearl, Douglas Feith </p><p>and Eliot Abrams, to protect Israel and strike any </p><p>force that could pose a threat to it.  This is the </p><p>American war on Iraq:  a colonialist, Zionist, oil- </p><p>related war, but definitely not a crusader </p><p>war..Statements issued by many Islamic organizations </p><p>and parties describing the American-Zionist war </p><p>against Iraq as a `crusader\' war are contributing to </p><p>making many friends into enemies.  They force us into </p><p>the American-Zionist trap that is seeking to create a </p><p>war of cultures between Islam and Christianity, all in </p><p>the service of Zionism.  This war on Iraq is not the </p><p>last one.  It might as well be called the `Iraq first\' </p><p>war.  It is going to be followed by other war against </p><p>countries and regimes in the region that do not abide </p><p>by the U.S. policy.  This long war will not only be in </p><p>the military sense, but also on the cultural, economic </p><p>and social levels.  The Arabs and Muslims will not be </p><p>able to fight it alone, that is if they decide to </p><p>fight it at all.  They will need those millions of </p><p>Christians, Budhists, Jews and other who took to the </p><p>streets in protest..  The haphazard speeches, the </p><p>extremism and turning friends into enemies is a first- </p><p>class foolish policy that cannot be justified by anger </p><p>against the American aggression.  Our real enemies are </p><p>those who colonize our lands, implement Zionist plans </p><p>and protect Israel." </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
