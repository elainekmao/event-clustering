<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 000715 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>CAIRO FOR POL - J. MAXSTADT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DECL: 4/17/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, MASS, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NOT A GOOD TIME TO BE THE AMERICAN AMBASSADOR </p><p>IN NIGERIA </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter for reason </p><p>1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary: The United States-Nigeria bilateral </p><p>relationship recently has experienced more friction </p><p>than has been noted for months.  A confluence of </p><p>foreign policy differences, bilateral concerns, and </p><p>Nigeria\'s domestic politics produced this strain. </p><p>Disagreement over Iraq and our suspension of military </p><p>assistance clearly contributed to the dissonance. </p><p>However, the agent that really ionized the atmosphere </p><p>has been the edginess and cynical political </p><p>considerations influencing the GON psychology during </p><p>this pressurized election period.  In short, some of </p><p>the President\'s advisors decided that wise diplomacy </p><p>did not make for good politics. Gauging U.S. </p><p>unpopularity due to Iraq, they saw that some </p><p>publicized U.S.-bashing might sway a few votes and </p><p>perhaps even distract some citizens from their </p><p>unhappiness with the GON\'s poor performance on key </p><p>issues.  Thus, they decided, in an effort to appear </p><p>"even-handed," to bait the electorate by linking our </p><p>military suspension to GON opposition to the war on </p><p>Iraq.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) The tripartite letter Obasanjo signed with </p><p>Presidents Wade and Mbeki was an ineffectual effort </p><p>that should have expired in the world of thought </p><p>before it entered the realm of action.  Nevertheless, </p><p>the GON did not vociferously oppose our stance on </p><p>Iraq, not prior to the actual intervention and even </p><p>less now.  Its opposition was consistently moderate in </p><p>both tone and substance.  While we had hoped Nigeria </p><p>would have been more supportive, its position was not </p><p>so extreme as to portend the media fall-out that </p><p>ensued. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) However, for the GON, bad diplomacy equalled </p><p>good domestic politics.  Given widespread opposition </p><p>in Nigeria to the war in Iraq, strategists within the </p><p>Administration figured electoral mileage could be had </p><p>by stating that our military assistance suspension was </p><p>in response to the GON stance on Iraq.  By casting </p><p>this willful misrepresentation, they hoped to stir the </p><p>prickly nationalism of elites, Northerners and </p><p>Southerners alike, all too aware of the centrifugal </p><p>forces that affect their country.  Doing so would lay </p><p>to rest accusations that Obasanjo was so intent on </p><p>doing America\'s bidding that he had become "Yoruba </p><p>First, the United States Second, and Nigeria Third." </p><p>Publicly slapping the U.S. would, these strategists </p><p>hoped, counter the President\'s pro-American </p><p>reputation, helping him particularly in the North, </p><p>where his support is the weakest and the risk of not </p><p>reaching the 25% threshhold therefore highest. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Moreover, but less importantly, Obasanjo </p><p>strategists felt this tack also would shift attention </p><p>away from the true reason for our assistance </p><p>suspension.  After having said that the suspension was </p><p>due to Washington\'s anger over Nigeria\'s policy on </p><p>Iraq, it would be difficult and nigh unpatriotic for </p><p>any opposition politician to correct the record by </p><p>pointing to the unresolved questions surrounding Benue </p><p>massacre.  If so, that politician ran the risk as </p><p>being labeled the new American lackey.  Creating this </p><p>fake linkage with Iraq helped minimize the impact of </p><p>our military assistance suspension as a campaign issue </p><p>and muted people from raising the Benue massacre as an </p><p>issue as well.  The GON\'s chief flack, Information </p><p>Minister Jerry Gana went a step beyond the original </p><p>words of the never-helpful Minister of State for </p><p>Foreign Affairs (Dubem Onyia), lashing out at the U.S. </p><p>during a regular weekly media brief for presuming to </p><p>know Nigeria\'s national interests better than its own </p><p>leaders. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) In a recent discussion, Presidential Special </p><p>Advisor on International Affairs Ad\'Obe Obe told </p><p>Ambassador Jeter "it was not a good time to be the </p><p>American Ambassador in Nigeria."  Among the Nigerian </p><p>political class, it was more popular to criticize </p><p>America right now and that reality had crept into the </p><p>electoral calculations of the President\'s team.  Obe </p><p>admitted that veracity had become an easy casualty of </p><p>these electoral calculations.  Obe claimed the </p><p>President had ordered a correction of the unfortunate </p><p>statements Onyia had used to precipitate this entire </p><p>episode.  However, the "clarification" issued by Gana </p><p>merely compounded Onyia\'s sophistry.  Obe said he </p><p>confronted Gana, who replied that the Onyia statement </p><p>was playing too well politically to be retracted. </p><p>COMMENT:  In a spontaneous and undoubtedly somewhat </p><p>exaggerated remark to a Mission spouse at about this </p><p>time, Obe\'s wife exclaimed, "My whole country hates </p><p>America now, but I still love you!"  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) The Ambassador stressed to Obe that continued </p><p>public mis-statement of the U.S. position might play </p><p>well within this circle of advisors but it had begun </p><p>to irritate Washington.  It projected a negative and </p><p>false image of the United States in Nigeria and </p><p>throughout Africa.  This disservice could not simply </p><p>be cast aside to political exigency.  The Ambassador </p><p>urged the GON to honor its promise to correct the </p><p>record; at the very least, the GON should cease and </p><p>desist from further negative comment on this issue. </p><p>He reminded Obe that if we were forced to clarify the </p><p>record, a USG statement would automatically focus </p><p>attention on the true cause of the assistance </p><p>suspension, the 2001 Benue massacre, presumably not an </p><p>issue that the GON would want to revive on the eve of </p><p>National Elections.  Obe reiterated that a correction </p><p>would be too politically costly to contemplate but he </p><p>also understood that continued misrepresentation would </p><p>be costly as well.  He said he would convey our </p><p>message. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Comment: Since the Ambassador\'s conversation </p><p>with Obe, GON statements on the military suspension </p><p>have ended.  Our message to Obe might have been </p><p>persuasive; but the cessation also likely reflects the </p><p>fact that the tale had lived out its immediate </p><p>utility.  Also, senior GON officials had become far </p><p>too engrossed with the demands of campaigning in their </p><p>local government areas where this fiction and the </p><p>friction arising from it were far less useful tools. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) In any event, the clear U.S. victory in Iraq </p><p>and GON preoccupation with the elections have begun to </p><p>lessen the tension in the bilateral discourse. </p><p>However, the bilateral tension will spike again, </p><p>perhaps even higher, if our assessment of the </p><p>elections is critical.  In an effort to impugn our </p><p>conclusion, Gana and Onyia would not be above claiming </p><p>that Nigeria\'s "stand against U.S. imperialism" (or </p><p>words to that effect) influenced our analysis. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
