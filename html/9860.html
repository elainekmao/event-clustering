<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 AMMAN 004827 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/03/2013 </p><p>TAGS: KISL, PREL, PHUM, XF, XA, XG </p><p>SUBJECT: POLITICAL ISLAM IN JORDAN: OPPOSITION MOSTLY FROM </p><p>WITHIN THE SYSTEM </p><p> </p><p>REF: SECSTATE 205815 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edward W. Gnehm for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d) </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>BACKGROUND: ISLAM JORDANIAN STYLE </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Political Islam is a mostly moderate force in </p><p>Jordanian society.  By far, the most important Islamic </p><p>organization in Jordan is the Muslim Brotherhood, and </p><p>then its political arm, the Islamic Action Front. </p><p>There are no other Islamic groups in the country that </p><p>match the MB/IAF in influence and size.  However, by </p><p>and large, political and social associations in Jordan </p><p>are mostly tribal-based rather than religion-based, </p><p>and as the recent Parliamentary elections showed, </p><p>tribal affiliations remain the most influential factor </p><p>in Jordanian politics.  There are several Islamic-run </p><p>charities in Jordan, but unlike Islamic charities in </p><p>other parts of the region, these charities do not </p><p>provide services for many in the population.  There </p><p>is a small minority of al-Qa\'ida-influenced extremists </p><p>in Jordan, but the GOJ has and continues to take a </p><p>very aggressive tack in dealing with Islamic extremism. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Answers below are keyed to Reftel paras: </p><p> </p><p>4) Post has provided below a thumbnail sketch of the </p><p>following influential organizations/individuals active </p><p>in Political Islam in Jordan: </p><p> </p><p>Muslim Brotherhood (MB)--The Jordan branch of the MB </p><p>originally began in 1945 as an offshoot of the </p><p>Egyptian MB, but it has never evolved into a violent </p><p>or subversive group.  The MB has a history of </p><p>cooperation with the GOJ and enjoyed a special </p><p>status under King Hussein\'s reign.  The King allowed </p><p>the MB to categorize itself as an Islamic society </p><p>during a time when political parties where banned in </p><p>Jordan, and as such, the MB was able to develop its </p><p>organizational structure and influence while other </p><p>political movements were forced underground.  During </p><p>the last 40 years, the MB has promoted its </p><p>political beliefs via its control over professional </p><p>associations, and through its social activities, </p><p>relatively modest welfare programs and media efforts. </p><p>Elements of the GOJ responsible for monitoring </p><p>religious extremists are concerned that the ultimate </p><p>aims of the MB are more radical than the </p><p>organization\'s stated policy and that there may be </p><p>links between MB members and more extremist </p><p>organizations.  The current leadership of the MB, </p><p>headed by East Banker Abdul Majid Thneibat, is </p><p>dominated by moderates, however there is a movement </p><p>within the organization towards a more radical public </p><p>line. </p><p> </p><p>Islamic Action Front (IAF)-- The IAF was established </p><p>as the political party representing the MB in 1992. </p><p>MB leaders created the IAF because they did not </p><p>want to jeopardize the MB\'s special status as a </p><p>social society.  The IAF is the only functioning </p><p>political party in Jordan.  With several thousand </p><p>members and an effective campaign machinery, the </p><p>IAF won 17 seats out of 110 in the recent </p><p>elections and will likely be able to attract </p><p>several other sympathetic Parliamentarians to form </p><p>the largest (but still minority) political bloc in </p><p>Parliament.  Its current leader is a moderate East </p><p>Banker, IAF Secretary General Hamza Mansour. </p><p>Although Mansour has made numerous provocative and </p><p>inciteful public statements, within the organization </p><p>he has called for cooperation with the government, </p><p>participation in the elections, and contacts </p><p>with foreign embassies (including the U.S.) </p><p> </p><p>Islamic Centrist Party--Roughly 120 IAF members who </p><p>promoted a more pluralistic and liberal agenda broke </p><p>away from the IAF in 2001 to form their own party, the </p><p>Islamic Centrist Party.  The party\'s platform includes </p><p>promoting the role of women in society, tolerance </p><p>and economic reform.  However, so far the party\'s </p><p>popular support has been limited and it won no seats </p><p>in the recent Parliamentary elections.  The party </p><p>is run by Secretary General Atef Btoush. </p><p> </p><p>Islamic Center Society--Probably the largest and most </p><p>established charity run by the Muslim Brotherhood. </p><p>The Islamic Center Society runs a number of health </p><p>clinics, secondary schools, and at least two </p><p>hospitals and underwrites these services for the poor. </p><p> </p><p>Takfir wa Hijra (Mohammad Shalabi)--A radical </p><p>offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood, the Takfir </p><p>wa Hijra (aka Takfiris) follow an extreme </p><p>fundamentalist version of Islam.  The GOJ has </p><p>labeled a group of Ma\'an-based extremists, </p><p>led by Mohammad Shalibi, aka Abu Sayyaf, as </p><p>Takfiris, although Shalibi denied any </p><p>connection to the Takfiris in a public interview </p><p>in November 2002.  The GOJ moved against the group </p><p>in November 2002 in the city of Ma\'an.  The crackdown </p><p>resulted in the deaths of several GOJ security </p><p>officials and Shalabi followers, but Shalabi\'s </p><p>current whereabouts are unknown. </p><p> </p><p>4a)  Parties/groups that advocate and seek a violent </p><p>overthrow of existing regimes, and express overt </p><p>hostility to political and religious pluralism, and </p><p>to secular and minority groups:  Shalabi and his </p><p>followers, loosely termed Takfir wa Hijra by the </p><p>GOJ, would fall under this category.  Also in this </p><p>category, are an unknown number of local-based </p><p>extremists who are associated with al-Qa\'ida or </p><p>followers of al-Qa\'ida associate Abu Mus\'ab al-Zarqawi. </p><p>Several of Zarqawi\'s associates were arrested in December </p><p>2002 for the assassination of US diplomat Laurence </p><p>Foley and are currently on trial for his </p><p>murder. </p><p> </p><p>4b)  Parties/groups who are anti-democratic and </p><p>anti-pluralistic, and who seek the overthrow of </p><p>existing regimes though not necessarily by violence: </p><p>Hizb al-Tahrir, an organization that professes to </p><p>advocate non-violent Islamic revolution, has an </p><p>unknown number of followers in Jordan. </p><p> </p><p>4c)  Parties/groups that are willing to engage in a </p><p>democratic, pluralistic process but who, if given </p><p>full power, would not respect the rights of </p><p>non-Islamists, secularists, and/or minorities: </p><p>Some members of the Islamic Action Front and Muslim </p><p>Brotherhood would probably fit this category.  The IAF </p><p>if given full power would likely support some laws </p><p>that would infringe upon the rights of others, </p><p>including the banning of alcohol, gender segregation in </p><p>schools, and mandatory use of the hejab for women. </p><p> </p><p>4d)  Parties/groups who engage in a democratic, </p><p>pluralistic process and who do/would respect the </p><p>rights of others as well as the principle of alternance </p><p>of government:  The IAF/MB mostly fit into this </p><p>category as they have historically worked with other </p><p>parties/minority groups within the political system. </p><p>They have also cooperated with the GOJ--to the extent </p><p>of circumscribing their own activities when the GOJ </p><p>has established parameters for their activities. </p><p> </p><p>5)  Post would not advocate assistance programs to </p><p>IAF or MB members.  Public statements attributed to </p><p>the MB have at times appeared to favor terrorist acts </p><p>against Israel and/or resistance to the US in Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>6a)  How are effective groups organized?  What makes </p><p>them effective?  What lessons could secular groups in </p><p>the same countries learn from the Islamists? </p><p> </p><p>--  The MB is the most effective Islamic group in </p><p>Jordan, while the IAF is the most effective political </p><p>party in Jordan.  Their effectiveness is based on </p><p>broad grassroots appeal, commitment to a set of </p><p>common causes, and strong organizational and financial </p><p>support from its members.  The IAF has been </p><p>effective in using the media to promote its message, </p><p>principally through the publication of "Al Sabeel", </p><p>Jordan\'s highest circulation weekly newspaper. </p><p> </p><p>What part of the population or potential electorate </p><p>could/do listed groups control individually and </p><p>collectively? </p><p> </p><p>--  The MB and IAF\'s appeal is broad and attracts both </p><p>East Bank and West Bank constituents.  Prior to changes </p><p>in the electoral law, the MB was able to garner </p><p>about 27 percent (22 of 80) of the Parliamentary seats </p><p>in the 1989 elections.  In the June 2003 elections, </p><p>the IAF won a total of 17 seats (out of 110), </p><p>despite expectations that the group would win at </p><p>least 20-22 seats.  A pollster from the Center for </p><p>Strategic Studies at Jordan University recently told us </p><p>that, based on unreleased polling data, he believes the </p><p>MB/IAF receives the support of about 15 percent of the </p><p>population.  MB influence in the professional associations </p><p>is much more dominant.  MB members usually dominate </p><p>poorly-attended elections and thereby control the </p><p>leadership in the most important associations, including </p><p>the engineering and medical associations. </p><p> </p><p>Do listed groups pursue a largely domestic or </p><p>internationalist agenda?  Do they receive funding or </p><p>other support from foreign governments or groups? </p><p> </p><p>--  The MB/IAF pursue a mostly domestic agenda with </p><p>one exception: the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  Almost </p><p>since its inception, the MB has pursued an anti-Israeli </p><p>agenda and rallied opposition to the Jordan-Israeli peace </p><p>treaty.  The MB and the IAF are leaders of anti-normalization </p><p>campaigns in Jordan.  Post knows of no foreign government </p><p>funding or support to the MB or IAF.  The GOJ monitors </p><p>the MB and IAF closely and would likely block any such </p><p>support from foreign sources.  We would point out that </p><p>most Jordanians view the Israeli-Palestinian conflict </p><p>as a domestic--and not international--issue. </p><p> </p><p>Do these groups view the shari\'ah as the immutable </p><p>seventh-century version or as an elastic body of guidance </p><p>able to evolve to fit contemporary circumstances? </p><p> </p><p>--  While public statements are steeped in shari\'ah, </p><p>in practicality, the MB and IAF in Parliament, and when </p><p>in government in the early 1990s, have a more </p><p>pragmatic approach to Islamic issues, particularly </p><p>with implementation of shari\'ah-mandated criminal </p><p>punishments. </p><p> </p><p>Do host nations have any prominent Islamic "modernizers"? </p><p>If so, are they associated with listed groups? </p><p>Antagonistic toward the groups? </p><p> </p><p>--  The MB and IAF are comparatively moderate entities </p><p>in the context of the spectrum of regional Islamic </p><p>political movements.  Both organizations are controlled </p><p>by the East Bank leaders, who traditionally have had close </p><p>ties to the regime. </p><p> </p><p>What role, if any, do listed groups play in intra-Islamic </p><p>debates? </p><p> </p><p>--  MB members are often invited and have attended regional </p><p>Islamic meetings, some of which have involved more radical </p><p>Islamists.  Post does not know the extent to which MB </p><p>members participate in the dialogue at these meetings. </p><p> </p><p>Do listed groups show any willingness to cooperate </p><p>politically or practically with non-Islamic parties/groups? </p><p> </p><p>--  Both the IAF and Islamic Centrist Party have worked </p><p>with non-Islamic blocs in Parliament to achieve common </p><p>goals.  The IAF has had a pragmatic approach to </p><p>working with non-Islamic parties, and even Christians </p><p>on occasion.  The Islamic Centrist Party, before Parliament </p><p>was dismissed in June 2001, called on some 30 other </p><p>political parties--representing a broad political </p><p>spectrum--to join it in creating a new Parliamentary </p><p>bloc.  However, Parliament was dismissed before it </p><p>could consolidate the new bloc. </p><p> </p><p>What is the attitude of listed groups toward the U.S.? </p><p>With groups opposed to the U.S., is opposition grounded </p><p>mainly in disagreement with U.S. policy or in anti- </p><p>Westernism more generally? </p><p> </p><p>--  Post notes that disagreements with the IAF/MB date </p><p>back to a couple of incidents, prior to the start of the </p><p>al-Aqsa Intifada, involving revoked visas for senior </p><p>IAF/MB leaders, who had previously enjoyed 5-year, multiple </p><p>entry visas to the U.S.  Prior to the visas issue, the </p><p>Embassy had regular--if not close--contact with leaders </p><p>of the MB and IAF.  The start of the al-Aqsa Intifada led </p><p>to the further disintegration of relations.  However, </p><p>in July 2002, Hamza Mansour, the leader of the IAF, </p><p>agreed to meet with R Special Coordinator Christopher </p><p>Ross for which he endured some tough internal criticism. </p><p>The IAF/MB have refused to meet with Embassy officials </p><p>since July 2002, and both groups have declined invitations </p><p>to Embassy events.  MB/IAF criticism is mostly limited </p><p>to statements against U.S. support for Israel, perceived </p><p>U.S. efforts to "normalize" Jordanian-Israeli relations, </p><p>alleged lack of U.S. support for Palestine, and U.S. </p><p>policy in Iraq. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
