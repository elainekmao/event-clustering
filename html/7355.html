(C) THE UNOFFICIAL STARTING GUN FOR THE NEXT </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION HAS GONE OFF, BUT PM RACAN\'S </p><p>COALITION-LEADING SDP IS STALLED AT THE START.  A NEW </p><p>USAID-SPONSORED IRI POLL SHOWS THAT ONLY 13 PERCENT OF VOTERS </p><p>NOW PLAN TO CAST THEIR BALLOTS FOR THE SDP.  VOTER </p><p>DISSATISFACTION WITH THE GOVERNMENT IS AT 68 PERCENT, </p><p>ESSENTIALLY THE SAME LEVEL IT WAS WITH THE LAST GOVERNMENT IN </p><p>1999 AFTER A DECADE OF WAR AND HDZ MISRULE HAD BROUGHT </p><p>CROATIA TO ECONOMIC RUIN AND INTERNATIONAL ISOLATION.  THE </p><p>SDP\'S FOUR SMALLER COALITION PARTNERS HAVE BEGUN TO PREPARE </p><p>THEMSELVES FOR THE ELECTION, AND OPPOSITION PARTIES ALREADY </p><p>HAVE THEIR CAMPAIGN BILLBOARDS OUT.  THE SDP, HOWEVER, IS IN </p><p>DISARRAY, AND RACAN FACES DISSENT WITHIN HIS OWN PARTY FROM </p><p>BOTH THE LEFT AND THE RIGHT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) IRI POLLSTERS SAY THAT IF THE SDP CAN TURN THINGS </p><p>AROUND, A COALITION WHICH EXCLUDES THE STILL-UNRECONSTRUCTED </p><p>HDZ CAN WIN IN ELECTIONS THIS AUTUMN.  THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>COMMUNITY AND CROATIAN VOTERS ARE RIGHT TO BE DISAPPOINTED BY </p><p>THE OPPORTUNITIES MISSED BY THE RACAN GOVERNMENT, BUT THERE </p><p>HAVE BEEN SOME IMPORTANT POSITIVE CHANGES.  FOR ALL THEIR </p><p>PERSONAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL FAILINGS, THE PARTIES WHICH MAKE </p><p>UP THIS GOVERNMENT ARE IN THE EUROPEAN MAINSTREAM.  ON ISSUES </p><p>OF MOST CONCERN TO US BUT (REGRETABLY) NOT TO THE TYPICAL </p><p>CROATIAN VOTER, THEIR PERFORMANCE IS VARIED: LITTLE PROGRESS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00803  01 OF 04  111156Z </p><p>OR COMMITMENT ON REFUGEE RETURNS, UNEVEN COOPERATION WITH </p><p>ICTY, AND GOOD NEIGHBORLY RELATIONS HAVE BEEN BUILT.  THESE </p><p>LEVELS WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED UNDER AN HDZ GOVERNMENT </p><p>BECAUSE ITS MANY OF ITS LEADING FIGURES AND CONSTITUENTS ARE </p><p>FUNDAMENTALLY OPPOSED TO BUILDING AN OPEN, INCLUSIVE CROATIA. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) AS MUCH AS WE REGRET RACAN\'S LACK OF LEADERSHIP, </p><p>THERE IS AS YET NO ALTERNATIVE TO A COALITION INCLUDING THE </p><p>SDP THAT DOES NOT INCLUDE THE FUNDAMENTALLY UNDEMOCRATIC HDZ. </p><p> UNLESS THE SDP CAN GET BACK ON ITS FEET, SUCH A COALITION </p><p>MAY NOT PREVAIL AT THE POLLS IN OCTOBER.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>IRI POLL SERVES AS ELECTION STARTING GUN </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) CROATIA\'S NEXT PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION MUST TAKE PLACE </p><p>BEFORE APRIL 2004, BUT THE COALITION HAS ALL BUT FORMALLY </p><p>ANNOUNCED ELECTIONS FOR OCTOBER 2003.  THE THREE LARGEST </p><p>PARTIES OF THE FIVE-PARTY COALITION WHICH MAKE UP THE </p><p>COALITION LED BY PM RACAN\'S SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY (SDP) </p><p>HAVE ALL ANNOUNCED THAT THEY WILL NOT JOIN A PRE-ELECTION </p><p>COALITION.  A USAID-SPONSORED IRI POLL COMPLETED ON MARCH 25 </p><p>SHOWS THAT THE SDP STILL LEADS THE COALITION, BUT HAS THE </p><p>SUPPORT OF ONLY 13 PERCENT OF RESPONDENTS WHO SAID THEY WOULD </p><p>TAKE PART IN ELECTIONS, DOWN FROM 23 PERCENT IN JUNE 2001, </p><p>BELOW THE OPPOSITION HDZ (22 PERCENT) AND FAR BEHIND THOSE </p><p>WHO SAID THEY WOULD VOTE BUT HAVE NOT MADE UP THEIR MINDS (29 </p><p>PERCENT). </p><p> </p><p>VOTER DISSATISFACTION NEAR ALL-TIME HIGH </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00803  01 OF 04  111156Z </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) ONE OF THE MOST STARTLING RESULTS FROM THE IRI POLL </p><p>(CONDUCTED BY PULS, CROATIA\'S LEADING PUBLIC-OPINION FIRM) IS </p><p>THAT ONLY 22 PERCENT OF RESPONDENTS THINK THAT CROATIA IS </p><p>HEADING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION, DOWN FROM A PEAK OF 57 </p><p>PERCENT AFTER THE COALITION TOOK OFFICE IN JANUARY 2000. </p><p>FULLY 68 PERCENT SAID THAT CROATIA IS BEING LED IN THE WRONG </p><p>DIRECTION, VERY CLOSE TO THE LEVEL OF VOTER DISSATISFACTION </p><p>IN 1999, AFTER NEARLY A DECADE OF WAR AND HDZ MISRULE.  THE </p><p>POLL SHOWS THAT 73 PERCENT OF CROATIANS BELIEVE THAT THE SDP </p><p>IS MOST RESPONSIBLE IN THE COALITION FOR GOC POLICY.  THREE </p><p>TIMES AS MANY RESPONDENTS BELIEVE THE SDP IS RESPONSIBLE FOR </p><p>SQUABBLES IN THE COALITION THAN THE SDP, AND 55 PERCENT </p><p>EITHER THOUGHT THE GOVERNMENT HAD DONE NOTHING GOOD DURING </p><p>ITS TENURE OR COULD NOT POINT TO A SINGLE POSITIVE </p><p>ACCOMPLISHMENT. </p><p> </p><p>IRI:  COALITION "SURVIVABLE" </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) NEVERTHELESS, IRI POLLSTERS SAID THE COALITION IN ITS </p><p>CURRENT FORM IS "SURVIVABLE," PROVIDED THE SDP COULD GET ITS </p><p>RATING UP TO 20 PERCENT.  THEY LAID OUT A STRATEGY -- WHICH </p><p>THEY LATER PITCHED TO ALL COALITION PARTIES -- WHERE THE </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ9232 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  00803  02 OF 04  111156Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AF-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   CIAE-00  INL-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    FBIE-00  VC-00    TEDE-00 </p><p>      INR-00   LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00 </p><p>      OMB-02   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00 </p><p>      SCT-00   SP-00    SSO-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  R-00     EPAE-00 </p><p>      IIP-00   PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-01   G-00     NFAT-00 </p><p>      SAS-00   SWCI-00    /006W </p><p>                  ------------------54417B  111156Z /38 </p><p>P 111157Z APR 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 9936 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY BELGRADE PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY LJUBLJANA PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY SARAJEVO PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY SKOPJE PRIORITY </p><p>USMISSION USOSCE PRIORITY </p><p>USMISSION USNATO PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 04 ZAGREB 000803 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EUR/SCE (NARDI) </p><p>STATE PLEASE PASS TO USAID - EE/ECA (CONVERY) </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/16/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, EAID, HR </p><p>SUBJECT: CROATIA ELECTIONS: RACAN\'S SDP NEEDS TO TURN IT </p><p>AROUND </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00803  02 OF 04  111156Z </p><p> </p><p>GOVERNMENT SHOULD FIRST TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR NOT LIVING UP </p><p>TO VOTER EXPECTATIONS AND THEN GET THE MESSAGE OUT ON THINGS </p><p>THEY HAVE DONE, ESPECIALLY ON JOB CREATION AND IN BRINGING </p><p>CROATIA\'S TOURIST INDUSTRY BACK TO LIFE. </p><p> </p><p>SDP GETS THE BAD NEWS </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) WE MET WITH SDP SECRETARY GENERAL IGOR DRAGOVAN, WHO </p><p>ATTENDED IRI\'S PRESENTATION OF THE POLL RESULTS TO HIS PARTY. </p><p> PM RACAN (PRESIDENT OF THE SDP) WAS NOT AVAILABLE, BUT KEY </p><p>SENIOR LEADERS WERE PRESENT, INCLUDING DEPUTY PM/DEFENSE </p><p>MINISTER ANTUNOVIC, LABOR MINISTER VIDOVIC AND INTERIOR </p><p>MINISTER LUCIN.  AFTER A BRIEF GRIPE ABOUT A LEAK TO THE </p><p>PRESS BY ANOTHER PARTY OF THE POLL\'S UNFAVORABLE SHOWING OF </p><p>THE SDP, DRAGOVAN EXPRESSED APPRECIATION FOR THE OPPORTUNITY </p><p>TO BE ABLE TO SHAPE HIS PARTY\'S MESSAGE IN TIME TO GET </p><p>RESULTS. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) DRAGOVAN WAS DISCOURAGED, BUT NOT SURPRISED, BY THE </p><p>FACT THAT VOTERS DON\'T KNOW ANY OF THE COALITION\'S </p><p>ACCOMPLISHMENTS.  DRAGOVAN AGREED WITH IRI\'S CRITICISM THAT </p><p>PM RACAN\'S INABILITY TO TAKE CREDIT FOR PROGRESS ON THE </p><p>ECONOMY IS COMPOUNDED BY HIS UNWILLINGNESS TO DEVELOP A </p><p>PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATIONS STAFF.  THE ONE POLL RESULT THAT </p><p>CAUGHT HIM BY SURPRISE WAS THAT VOTERS BELIEVE THE SDP IS </p><p>RESPONSIBLE FOR MOST OF THE SQUABBLES BETWEEN COALITION </p><p>PARTNERS.  DRAGOVAN INSISTED THAT THE CROATIAN PEASANT\'S </p><p>PARTY (HSS) HAS BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR ALMOST ALL OF THE </p><p>CONFLICTS. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00803  02 OF 04  111156Z </p><p> </p><p>RACAN WANTS TO RUN ON HIS RECORD </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) DESPITE THE SDP\'S CURRENT STANDING, DRAGOVAN IS </p><p>OPTIMISTIC AND CLAIMS THE SDP HAS A PLAN TO GET OUT THE WORD. </p><p> HE GAVE US A COPY OF A BOOKLET THE SDP IS ISSUING TO ALL </p><p>PARTY MEMBERS TO GIVE THEM CONCRETE FACTS TO REFUTE </p><p>ALLEGATIONS ABOUT THE COALITION\'S INACTION.  THE LIST OF </p><p>ACCOMPLISHMENTS IS IMPRESSIVE, ESPECIALLY WHEN COMPARED WITH </p><p>THE PRECEDING HDZ GOVERNMENT\'S FAILURE.  THERE ARE "TALKING </p><p>POINTS" FOR SDP RANK-AND-FILE ON ALL SUBJECT AREAS, BUT </p><p>DRAGOVAN BELIEVES THE BOOKLET\'S FRAMING OF THE GOC\'S TRACK </p><p>RECORD ON THE ECONOMY WILL BE MOST CONVINCING.  STATISTICS </p><p>CITED IN THE SDP\'S "WHAT WE HAVE ACCOMPLISHED" BOOKLET </p><p>INCLUDE: </p><p> </p><p>- STEADY, IMPRESSIVE GROWTH IN GDP, FROM -0.4 PERCENT IN 1999 </p><p>TO 5.2 PERCENT IN 2002; </p><p>- PER CAPITA GDP IS NOW 5,150 EURO, AHEAD OF NINE EU </p><p>CANDIDATE COUNTRIES; </p><p>- INFLATION DOWN STEADILY: </p><p>- RETIREMENT OF MOST OF THE HDZ-ERA DEBT; </p><p>- 3.2 BILLION DOLLARS IN FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT: </p><p>- REDUCTION OF THE STATE BUDGET OUTLAYS; </p><p>- REDUCTION OF INTEREST RATES FOR CONSUMER CREDIT; </p><p>- IMPROVING THE PERFORMANCE OF STATE OWNED ENTERPRISES; </p><p>- INCREASING THE REAL WAGES OF THE AVERAGE WORKER; AND </p><p>- REDUCING UNEMPLOYMENT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 20 YEARS. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) DRAGOVAN TOLD US THAT THE SDP\'S WAR CHEST IS FULL </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00803  02 OF 04  111156Z </p><p>AND THEY PLAN TO ROLL OUT ADS THIS SUMMER TAKING CREDIT FOR </p><p>THEIR ACCOMPLISHMENTS.  HE WAS FRUSTRATED THAT THE SDP\'S </p><p>SMALLER COALITION PARTNER HNS HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH </p><p>PROGRESS TOWARD COMPLETING THE ZAGREB-SPLIT HIGHWAY, WHICH </p><p>VOTERS CITE AS ONE OF THE FEW ACHIEVEMENTS OF THIS GOVERNMENT </p><p>(EVEN THOUGH THE HIGHWAY WILL NOT BE COMPLETED BEFORE </p><p>ELECTIONS). </p><p> </p><p>DISSENT WITHIN THE SDP </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) IN ADDITION TO THE PROBLEM OF GETTING HIS MESSAGE </p><p>OUT, RACAN FACES OPEN DISSENT FROM WITHIN HIS OWN PARTY\'S </p><p>RANKS.  ON APRIL 2, SDP MP ZLATKO SESELJ QUIT THE PARLIAMENT, </p><p>RETURNING HIS MANDATE TO THE SDP.  SESELJ TOLD THE PRESS THAT </p><p>HE IS FED UP THAT HIS PARTY HAS CONSISTENTLY BACKED DOWN IN </p><p>THE FACE OF PRESSURE FROM THE HSS.  THE LAST STRAW IN </p><p>SESELJ\'S CASE WAS THE SDP AGREEING TO APPROVE THE HSS </p><p>EDUCATION MINISTER\'S PROPOSED HIGH SCHOOL TEXTBOOKS WHICH, </p><p>ACCORDING TO SESELJ "ARE NOT WORTH THE PAPER THEY\'RE PRINTED </p><p>ON."  SESELJ, A CAREER EDUCATOR AND OWNER OF A PRIVATE HIGH </p><p>SCHOOL IN ZAGREB, SAID THAT THE HSS TEXTBOOK "PASSED BECAUSE </p><p>OF HSS PRESIDENT TOMCIC\'S "BLACKMAIL." </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ9234 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  00803  03 OF 04  111156Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AF-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   CIAE-00  INL-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    FBIE-00  VC-00    TEDE-00 </p><p>      INR-00   LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00 </p><p>      OMB-02   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00 </p><p>      SCT-00   SP-00    SSO-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  R-00     EPAE-00 </p><p>      IIP-00   PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-01   G-00     NFAT-00 </p><p>      SAS-00   SWCI-00    /006W </p><p>                  ------------------54418B  111157Z /38 </p><p>P 111157Z APR 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 9937 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY BELGRADE PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY LJUBLJANA PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY SARAJEVO PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY SKOPJE PRIORITY </p><p>USMISSION USOSCE PRIORITY </p><p>USMISSION USNATO PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 04 ZAGREB 000803 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EUR/SCE (NARDI) </p><p>STATE PLEASE PASS TO USAID - EE/ECA (CONVERY) </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/16/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, EAID, HR </p><p>SUBJECT: CROATIA ELECTIONS: RACAN\'S SDP NEEDS TO TURN IT </p><p>AROUND </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00803  03 OF 04  111156Z </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) ZDRAVKO TOMAC, CHAIR OF THE PARLIAMENT\'S FOREIGN </p><p>AFFAIRS COMMITTEE, IS ACTIVELY SUBVERTING SOME OF HIS PARTY\'S </p><p>TACTICS ON ELECTIONS.  DRAGOVAN TOLD US THAT RACAN HAS BEEN </p><p>TRYING TO EASE TOMAC OUT THE DOOR FOR YEARS, BUT THE JOWLY, </p><p>CANTANKEROUS PROFESSOR JUST WON\'T GO.  FORMERLY A PARTY VICE </p><p>PRESIDENT, TOMAC IS NO LONGER EVEN A MEMBER OF THE SDP </p><p>CENTRAL COMMITTEE.  DRAGOVAN TOLD US THAT RACAN TRIED TO GET </p><p>THE MESSAGE ACROSS BY FIRING TOMAC\'S SISTER FROM A COMFY SPOT </p><p>AS ASSISTANT MINISTER OF VETERANS\' AFFAIRS, BUT TOMAC HANGS </p><p>ON, USING HIS COMMITTEE CHAIR AS A PULPIT FOR HIS OWN PET </p><p>POLICY: INSISTING THAT THE DAYTON AGREEMENT BE REVISED TO </p><p>CREATE A SEPARATE ENTITY FOR ETHNIC CROATS IN BIH.  (NOTE: </p><p>EACH TIME TOMAC MAKES SUCH AN ANNOUNCEMENT, GOC AND SDP </p><p>OFFICIALS MAKE STATEMENTS DECLARING THAT TOMAC DOES NOT SPEAK </p><p>FOR EITHER THE PARTY OR THE GOVERNMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C) WE AND MANY IN THE MEDIA THOUGHT TOMAC HAD FINALLY </p><p>CROSSED THE LINE WHEN AS A GUEST AT THE ANNUAL CONVENTION OF </p><p>THE MODERATE OPPOSITION PARTY DEMOCRATIC CENTER (DC), HE WAS </p><p>QUOTED AS SAYING HE WOULD SUPPORT DC PRESIDENT MATE GRANIC AS </p><p>A CANDIDATE FOR PRIME MINISTER.  HOWEVER, RACAN\'S ONLY </p><p>RESPONSE WAS TO REMARK THAT "TOMAC SEEMS TO BE DISTANCING </p><p>HIMSELF FROM THE SDP."   DRAGOVAN TOLD US THAT RACAN SEEKS TO </p><p>AVOID THE APPEARANCE OF DISSENT WITHIN THE PARTY AND DOES NOT </p><p>WANT TO ALIENATE THE MORE CONSERVATIVE SDP VOTERS WHO </p><p>ASSOCIATE WITH TOMAC. </p><p> </p><p>ELECTION-YEAR LEGISLATION? </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00803  03 OF 04  111156Z </p><p>14.  (C) ALTHOUGH IT IS LATE IN THE LEGISLATIVE SEASON FOR </p><p>NEW INITIATIVES, THE SDP IS TRYING TO GET THROUGH TWO MORE </p><p>"REFORMS" WHICH THEY HOPE WILL BE POPULAR WITH VOTERS.  ONE </p><p>IS AN ELECTION-YEAR TAX REFORM, ANNOUNCED IN GENERAL TERMS ON </p><p>APRIL 7.  THE SDP PROPOSES BROAD CUTS TO INCOME TAXES AND TO </p><p>OFFSET THE LOSS WITH INCREASES IN PROPERTY TAXES.  THE OTHER </p><p>IS REFORM OF THE LABOR CODE, BUT THE SDP EFFORT SEEMS TO HAVE </p><p>RUN OUT OF STEAM.  FOLLOWING A LONG STALEMATE, GOVERNMENT, </p><p>EMPLOYER, AND LABOR UNION NEGOTIATORS APPEARED TO BE ON TRACK </p><p>TO REACHING A COMPROMISE ON A NEW LABOR LAW.  BUT ON APRIL 9, </p><p>LABOR LEADERS WALKED OUT OF NEGOTIATIONS, INSISTING THAT THE </p><p>GOC WAS NOT NEGOTIATING IN GOOD FAITH.  ONE OBSERVER NOTED </p><p>THAT THE TIMING OF THE WALKOUT IS PREDICTABLE: UNIONS JUST </p><p>WANT TO GET THE BEST DEAL THEY CAN BEFORE THEIR TRADITIONAL </p><p>PROTEST ON MAY 1; IF THEY HELP BRING DOWN THE SDP, THEY ARE </p><p>UNLIKELY TO GET A BETTER DEAL FROM THE HDZ. </p><p> </p><p>ELECTION LAW GAMBLE WOULD RELY ON AGREEMENT WITH BIH </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>15.  (C) ON APRIL 3, THE CROATIAN PARLIAMENT PASSED TECHNICAL </p><p>CHANGES TO EXISTING ELECTION LAW WHEN COALITION PARTNERS </p><p>COULD NOT COME TO COMPROMISE ON A NEW ELECTORAL MODEL.  THE </p><p>SABOR BROUGHT THE OLD LAW INTO LINE WITH THE NEW </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL LAW ON NATIONAL MINORITIES AND MADE SOME OTHER </p><p>IMPORTANT TECHNICAL CHANGES, BUT DID NOT ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF </p><p>DIASPORA VOTING.  ALL CROATIAN CITIZENS, REGARDLESS OF WHERE </p><p>THEY RESIDE, STILL HAVE A RIGHT UNDER CROATIA\'S CONSTITUTION, </p><p>TO VOTE IN PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS.  IN THE LAST ELECTION, </p><p>HARD-LINE NATIONALIST CROATS FROM BOSNIA USED THIS TO ELECT </p><p>SIX MP\'S ON THE HDZ SLATE. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00803  03 OF 04  111156Z </p><p> </p><p>16.  (C) THE GOC IS COUNTING ON SIGNING A NEW BILATERAL </p><p>AGREEMENT ON DUAL CITIZENSHIP WITH BIH WHICH WOULD PREVENT </p><p>CROATS WHO VOTED IN BOSNIA FROM VOTING IN CROATIA.  WHILE THE </p><p>MFA INFORMS US THAT NEGOTIATIONS ARE WELL ALONG, OTHER </p><p>OBSERVERS WARN US THAT THIS AGREEMENT COULD BE AT RISK IF BIH </p><p>DECIDES TO PLAY HARDBALL AND LINK THE DUAL CITIZENSHIP </p><p>AGREEMENT TO PROGRESS ON OTHER ISSUES.  ONE SUCH ISSUE OF </p><p>GREAT IMPORTANCE TO BIH IS THE LONG-PENDING AGREEMENT ON THE </p><p>STATUS OF THE PORT OF PLOCE.
