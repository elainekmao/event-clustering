Berry.  Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  According to Jordan\'s Transportation Minister, the </p><p>Jordanian government remains ready to work with Israel on a </p><p>plan to allow domestic flights bound for Eilat to land in </p><p>Aqaba (REFTEL).  The Ministry has also prepared contingency </p><p>plans for a possible conflict in Iraq.  Regarding Royal </p><p>Jordanian Airlines (RJ), Dahabi, a former CEO of RJ, said the </p><p>government had subsidized the airline over the past year, but </p><p>hoped those costs would be one-off expenses.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>ISRAELI FLIGHTS TO AQABA: WE ARE READY </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) In a December 11 meeting, Transportation Minister </p><p>Nader Dahabi told the Charge that Jordan was ready to </p><p>accommodate Israeli domestic flights at Aqaba airport </p><p>following a decision by the Israeli government to discontinue </p><p>such flights into Eilat airport for safety and environmental </p><p>reasons (REFTEL).  He said that prior to the call for new </p><p>Israeli elections in November, he had received a letter from </p><p>then Israeli Transportation Minister Sneh requesting a </p><p>meeting to discuss the idea, a revival, after a fashion, of </p><p>the Peace Airport in Aqaba called for in the Israel-Jordan </p><p>Peace Treaty.  Dahabi said that a meeting (reported in </p><p>reftel) was held without Sneh\'s participation, but with both </p><p>sides\' Civil Aviation Authorities, the directors of the Eilat </p><p>and Aqaba airports and Aqaba Chief Commissioner Aqel Biltaji </p><p>attending. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (sbu)  As a result of the meeting, there appeared to be a </p><p>broad consensus to move forward based on the Jordanian </p><p>proposal described in reftel.  However, the call for early </p><p>elections seems to have put off the Israeli side\'s ability to </p><p>pursue discussions.  Dahabi added that the MOU from a 1998 </p><p>pilot project could act as the basis for any agreement, and </p><p>reiterated the government\'s readiness to continue talks after </p><p>the elections.  This tracks with recent conversations with </p><p>CAA Director Hanna Najjar and Aqaba International Airport </p><p>Director Omar al-Manha who have told us that they are ready </p><p>to go once the Israelis are. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>"DOING OUR HOMEWORK" RE: IRAQ </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Regarding transportation contingency plans in </p><p>response to possible military action in Iraq, Dahabi said </p><p>that he, PM Abul Ragheb, and Minister of Planning Awadallah, </p><p>"had done their homework" to see how such an action would </p><p>affect Jordan\'s transport sector.  He said they were very </p><p>realistic, sensing that at the beginning of a conflict, </p><p>"things would be very hard, but would ease up".  Dahabi said </p><p>that he has been direct with the industry about relying too </p><p>much on Iraq, and has told private and public sector </p><p>transportation interests that they have to look for other </p><p>markets.  He said that he had worked with maritime, civil </p><p>aviation, and public and private companies to find ways to </p><p>deal with any inflow of refugees should hostilities drive </p><p>them into Jordan.  He stressed the government was determined </p><p>to not build refugee camps; rather, it would find ways to, </p><p>for example, get third-country refugees back to their native </p><p>countries.  Dahabi said the government was working with NGOs </p><p>as well, and would be well prepared when the time comes. </p><p>(Comment: Dahabi\'s comments reflect what we have heard from </p><p>GOJ and UN contacts.  In addition, we have heard separately </p><p>that IOM has contracted with Jordanian bus and shipping </p><p>companies to transfer up to 100,000 TCN\'s from Iraq to </p><p>Jordan.  End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>RJ: STILL SUBSIDIZED </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Dahabi acknowledged that Royal Jordanian Airlines </p><p>reported the first three quarters of 2002 were profitable, </p><p>but he cautioned against reading too much into the figures. </p><p>He said the auditor\'s figures, which will be released in </p><p>April, will be more comprehensive, as they will include the </p><p>"slow months" from October through December.  More important, </p><p>he said the government has provided a number of subsidies to </p><p>the airline to address the impact of the September 11 attacks </p><p>on tourism and air travel.  He said the value of these </p><p>amounted to $45 million.  For example, Dahabi said, the </p><p>government was carrying third party insurance on RJ in the </p><p>event a hijacked RJ plane was crashed into a building, a </p><p>policy that makes the government liable for $1 billion, and </p><p>would cost RJ $3 million per year.  He said the government </p><p>urged RJ to layoff 500 employees, who would have to be </p><p>compensated to the tune of $7 million, and the GOJ assumed </p><p>those costs.  In addition to other miscellaneous costs, the </p><p>Ministry of Finance has also, in the interests of cash flow, </p><p>postponed collecting $14 million owed by RJ.  In any case, he </p><p>said, these were one-off expenses, and expected that RJ would </p><p>"be okay" in the end.  (Note: Dahabi also updated us on the </p><p>status of the Boeing/Airbus offers, reported SEPTEL.  End </p><p>note) </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>HELP FOR QIZS? </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) Regarding shipping challenges, Dahabi said he heard </p><p>from various private sector representatives that they were </p><p>"worried" about shipping delays through Israeli ports.  He </p><p>said that he would like to talk to Israeli officials about </p><p>how to ease QIZ exports through the port of Haifa.  He said </p><p>that despite efforts to develop Aqaba as an option for QIZ </p><p>exporters, Haifa clearly remained the favored port, </p><p>particularly for exporters in Northern Jordan who ship to the </p><p>Eastern U.S., as "you can always find a ship bound to the </p><p>U.S. in Haifa; you can not always find one in Aqaba". </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  We defer to Embassy Tel Aviv as to whether a new </p><p>Israeli government might be interested in pursuing the option </p><p>of using Aqaba airport.  The Israeli ambassador in Amman </p><p>tells us that the political levels in the GOI have generally </p><p>been supportive, but that the Israeli CAA has resisted the </p><p>use of Aqaba for "special interest reasons."  Whatever the </p><p>dynamics in the GOI may be, the Jordanians are ready to move </p><p>(and perhaps, CAA Director Najjar hinted, accommodate some of </p><p>those "special interests"), but firmly believe it is up to </p><p>Israel to make the next move. </p><p> </p><p>--- </p><p>BIO </p><p>--- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU)  Dahabi, who has been in the Abul Ragheb cabinet </p><p>since 2001, was CEO of RJ for 7 years prior to his </p><p>appointment to the government.  Before that he was an air </p><p>force general.  He has a Masters in Engineering from </p><p>Cranfield in the UK, and a Masters in Public Administration </p><p>from Auburn. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
