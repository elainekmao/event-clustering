<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 SANAA 001101 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR DRL SR. COORDINATOR KLADAKIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PGOV, PREL, KDEM, ELAB, YE, HUMAN RIGHTS, DEMOCRATIC REFORM </p><p>SUBJECT: USG SUPPORT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS IN YEMEN </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 13796 </p><p> </p><p>------ </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. In 2002, Embassy Sanaa managed several successful programs </p><p>that encourage respect for human rights in Yemen, including </p><p>equal access to education, human rights training for military </p><p>officers, and 17 small grants focused on grassroots democracy </p><p>and the development of civil society. </p><p> </p><p>Most notably, during 2002 preparations for the recent </p><p>national parliamentary elections, the Mission worked closely </p><p>with major NGOs to support nationwide voter registration </p><p>programs, the development of political parties, women\'s </p><p>political participation (43% of registered voters) and </p><p>training for effective local governance.  These efforts </p><p>culminated recently with exceptionally high participation </p><p>(75% of all registered voters) in national elections judged </p><p>generally free, fair and peaceful by international observers. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS - A CRITICAL MISSION OBJECTIVE </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>2. Promoting respect for human rights in Yemen is a top </p><p>Mission priority that directly supports the essential US </p><p>interests: eradicating terrorism and ensuring stable, </p><p>democratic governments in the region.  Yemen is a poor </p><p>country with explosive population growth (3.5%), traditional </p><p>social structures that exclude women, widespread adult </p><p>illiteracy, troublesome levels of corruption, and radical </p><p>religious groups.  However, it has also been making </p><p>measurable progress in moving toward democracy, the rule of </p><p>law, and increased participation for its citizens in an </p><p>effective civil society. </p><p> </p><p>3. The Embassy\'s Democracy Working Group (DWG) includes </p><p>American and FSN members from every Country Team agency. It </p><p>maintains close contacts with local and international NGOs, </p><p>as well as other foreign missions working on development and </p><p>human rights issues.  With no direct-hire American USAID </p><p>officers at post, DWG members work together on Mission  human </p><p>rights agenda.  They monitor grants, evaluate proposals, </p><p>recruit promising candidates for the International Visitors\' </p><p>Program, and visit distant field projects.  The Ambassador, </p><p>the DCM and other officers make human rights issues a regular </p><p>part of their conversations with leaders in every segment of </p><p>society. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>EDUCATING NEW LEADERS </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. Education/Participation:  In 2002, USDA PL 416 (B) funded </p><p>12.4 million dollars for the construction and furnishing of </p><p>new primary schools for girls in isolated rural areas. This </p><p>will provide thousands of young women their first access to </p><p>modern education and their first entry into civil society. </p><p>The International Visitors\' Program allowed a number of young </p><p>Yemeni leaders to share and debate US perspectives on such </p><p>issues as "Women as Political Partners." </p><p> </p><p>5. Military Training:  In 2002, Defense Department </p><p>Counter-Terrorism Fellowship funds ($450,000) provided many </p><p>opportunities for promising Yemeni officers and </p><p>non-commissioned officers to learn increased respect for </p><p>human rights as an essential element of their professional </p><p>military studies.  These courses, either in the US or </p><p>directed by US military trainers in Yemen, have produced </p><p>gratifying results: a marked decrease in cases of human </p><p>rights abuse by the Yemeni military.  The Embassy\'s Office of </p><p>Military Cooperation is tracking these results to ensure the </p><p>most effective training in years to come. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>PROMOTING DEMOCRACY </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  Small Grants/Big Results:  The Embassy\'s Public Diplomacy </p><p>Office funded 17 programs throughout Yemen in 2002, totaling </p><p>almost $100,000, through the Democracy Small Grants Projects: </p><p>The individual cost of these programs is small, but the goals </p><p>are ambitious.  For example: to "Educate Society Leaders in </p><p>Human Rights Law" ten influential preachers/prayer leaders </p><p>from mosques throughout the country gathered for a series of </p><p>workshops on political, civil and constitutional rights </p><p>guaranteed under Yemen\'s new Human Rights Law.  To combat </p><p>"Violence Against Women", project leaders drawn from local </p><p>women\'s groups worked with officials from several Ministries </p><p>to raise  awareness of the psychological, medical, criminal, </p><p>cultural and legal roots of these crimes.  This 2002 </p><p>initiative helped lead to the recent establishment of a </p><p>national network of women\'s groups helping victims of </p><p>domestic violence. </p><p> </p><p>7.  Training Local Councils: In 2002, the National Democratic </p><p>Institute (NDI) began an ambitious program to train local </p><p>councils.  Throughout Yemen, local councils control </p><p>significant resources and provide basic services to Yemen\'s </p><p>population: trained members are essential to combat </p><p>traditional problems of patronage, corruption, and gender </p><p>bias.   The Mission will continue to work closely with NDI on </p><p>this ongoing project, and seek additional funding for it from </p><p>the Middle East Partnership Initiative (MEPI), the Economic </p><p>Support Fund (ESF) and the Middle East Democracy Fund (MEDF). </p><p> </p><p>8.  The Infrastructure of Free Elections: NDI and the </p><p>International Foundation for Election Systems (IFES) also </p><p>provided special training in 2002 to strengthen Yemen\'s </p><p>multi-party system.  Funds from MEPI and MEDF helped support </p><p>comprehensive technical and organizational assistance to the </p><p>Government of Yemen.  NDI staffers worked directly with local </p><p>political activists, focusing on women\'s political </p><p>participation, voter registration, and local governance. </p><p> </p><p>9.  The Results: In the April, 2003 national parliamentary </p><p>elections,  Yemen scored encouraging international marks for </p><p>organization, participation, and security. The Ambassador and </p><p>twenty-five Embassy Sanaa staffers joined international </p><p>election observers from IFES, NDI, the EU and the United </p><p>Nations, at polling places throughout the country.  Although </p><p>much work remains, 2002 was a year of progress for human </p><p>rights in Yemen, with positive and measurable results.  The </p><p>MIssion will continue to build on that record. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>ADDENDUM </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>11.
