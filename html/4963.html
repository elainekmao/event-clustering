<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 LAGOS 000025 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SECSTATE FOR ECA/A/E/AF (EBerelson, WBell, AMartin) </p><p>INFO AF/PD (AAmirthanayagam); Abuja for CPAO, CAO, CAS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, OEXC, SCUL, NI </p><p>SUBJECT:  FULBRIGHT ALUMNI ASSOCIATION OF NIGERIA </p><p>SUCCESSFULLY INAUGURATES BOARD OF TRUSTEES AT THIRD </p><p>          ANNUAL CONFERENCE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.   SUMMARY: The 3rd annual conference of the </p><p>Fulbright Alumni Association of Nigeria (FAAN) was held </p><p>from November 25-28 at Nsukka, home of the first </p><p>indigenous Nigerian university. The three-day program </p><p>with the theme "Globalization and Development In </p><p>Nigeria" included addresses by the CPAO and a current </p><p>U.S. senior Fulbright scholar; a message read from DAS- </p><p>Academic Programs Thomas A. Farrell; and the </p><p>inauguration of the newly-formed Board of Trustees, an </p><p>innovative idea to enhance interest and planning </p><p>activities of FAAN.  After a relatively unsuccessful </p><p>2001 conference, FAAN proved to PAS this year that it </p><p>was capable of organizing a productive conference, and </p><p>PAS was proud to have sponsored this year\'s successful </p><p>event. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  DESCRIPTION OF ACTIVITY: The conference began with </p><p>a PAS courtesy call on the Chairman of the conference </p><p>and host Vice-Chancellor, former Fulbright Professor </p><p>Ginigeme Mbanefoh who also delivered the welcome </p><p>address that preceded an inspiring keynote address by </p><p>Professor Elizabeth U. Anyakoha, a renowned UNN </p><p>lecturer on vocational education.  The CPAO read a </p><p>congratulatory message from DAS-Academic Programs </p><p>Thomas A. Farrell and delivered remarks on finding </p><p>one\'s niche in a globalized world. Duly registered as a </p><p>corporate body, a Board of Trustees for FAAN was </p><p>inaugurated as part of the opening ceremonies.  The new </p><p>FAAN Board is composed of many of Nigeria\'s world class </p><p>scholars, including the first and only female Vice </p><p>Chancellor as well as several other VCs. Papers on sub- </p><p>themes related to the central theme of `Globalization </p><p>and Development in Nigeria\' were presented, discussed </p><p>and defended. There was a consensus that liberal </p><p>democratization is an essential ingredient, as well as </p><p>national security, good governance, and observance of </p><p>the rule of law, for globalization and development in </p><p>Nigeria. Finally, a new National Executive Board was </p><p>elected for a two-year term, and it was decided to hold </p><p>the 2003 conference at the Nigerian Institute of Policy </p><p>and Strategic Studies (NIPSS), a prominent public think- </p><p>tank in Jos. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The presence of Dr. Jean Borgatti, current U.S. </p><p>Fulbright senior scholar of Art History at the </p><p>University of Benin, gave a fresh and aesthetic insight </p><p>into the topics at hand.  She also suggested creating a </p><p>FAAN website on which all the papers could be placed </p><p>for other Fulbrighters and the general public to read, </p><p>and she offered to help create the web-site for the </p><p>Association. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Another new development was the decision to publish a </p><p>journal of all papers presented at the conference. </p><p>Many far-reaching innovations and recommendations were </p><p>brought up in the course of the Annual General Meeting </p><p>(AGM) on the second day of the conference, such as the </p><p>introduction of the Fulbright conference journal to the </p><p>GON through the Federal Ministry of Education. At the </p><p>end of the conference, a communiqu was issued to all </p><p>participants about the highlights of the discussions, </p><p>and this communiqu will be forwarded to Education </p><p>committees in government circles as well as all Vice- </p><p>Chancellors of Nigerian universities.  FAAN hopes to </p><p>eventually become self-funded and be an important voice </p><p>in government decision-making processes in the </p><p>educational sector. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.   BACKGROUND: FAAN is one of Nigeria\'s newest </p><p>academic associations though the large Nigerian </p><p>Fulbright academic exchange program dates back to the </p><p>early 1970s. Inaugurated in 2000, the Association is </p><p>now fully registered with the Corporate Affairs </p><p>s </p><p>Commission as a corporate body with a Constitution and </p><p>a National Executive Council (NEC).  Although FAAN had </p><p>a rocky start, enthusiasm of the National Executive is </p><p>high, and this year\'s conference has been a positive </p><p>force for reinvigorating the organization. </p><p>In his presidential address, Professor G. M. Babatunde, </p><p>outgoing FAAN President and new FAAN Board member, </p><p>praised the timeliness of the conference theme and </p><p>encouraged members to consider how to make FAAN </p><p>relevant to the Nigerian university system and an </p><p>audible voice in government policy-making. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. Result/Impact: Excellent.  The selection of the </p><p>theme "Globalization and Development in Nigeria" was </p><p>timely, relevant, and thought-provoking. It will form </p><p>the basis for much of FAAN\'s future planning and </p><p>activities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. Date: November 25-28, 2002  FY 2003, First Quarter </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. MPP Umbrella Theme: Strengthening Economic Growth </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. Audience Reached: Despite being held during Ramadan, </p><p>70 Fulbright alumni and participants from as far as </p><p>Bayero University in Kano State attended.  Others, </p><p>university students, Trustees of the Board and other </p><p>guest participants who are interested in the Fulbright </p><p>program, were greatly influenced by the extensive </p><p>deliberations by academics and researchers, Vice- </p><p>Chancellors, Deputy Vice-Chancellors, Deans and </p><p>lecturers alike who were at the conference.  The </p><p>Fulbright scholars will incorporate the knowledge </p><p>gained from these papers in their lectures to varying </p><p>student populations in their respective institutions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The FAAN National Executive has also commenced plans to </p><p>publish a journal of all papers presented at the 3rd </p><p>annual conference for future reference purposes at </p><p>universities throughout the country.  In addition, the </p><p>conference attracted a total of twenty new subscribers </p><p>to the Embassy\'s Crossroads newsletter.  A full report </p><p>of the FAAN conference will be published in the next </p><p>edition of the Crossroads, providing information on </p><p>FAAN to the 6,000 subscribers. Finally, the planned </p><p>FAAN web-site will facilitate communication and unity </p><p>among Fulbright alumni across the nation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. Non-USG Funding: FAAN had a total sum of over Naira </p><p>400,000.00 (approximately USD 3,000.00) in its bank </p><p>account, which was used to commence planning activities </p><p>for this year\'s conference.  The money represented </p><p>annual dues paid by alumni over the past two years as </p><p>well as minor cash donations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. Quality of U.S. Support: Excellent.  FAAN is </p><p>especially grateful to ECA/A/E/AF for securing the </p><p>DAS\'s special message, which clearly touched the </p><p>participants. PAS would also appreciate receiving </p><p>information on alternate sources of funding to augment </p><p>PAS funds. </p><p>HINSON-JONES </p><p></p></div>
