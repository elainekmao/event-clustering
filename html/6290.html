<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 001565 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, P, EUR/SE AND EB </p><p>TREASURY FOR U/S TAYLOR AND OASIA - MILLS </p><p>NSC FOR QUANRUD AND BRYZA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY\'S ECONOMY MARCH 12: MARKETS IGNORE MOODY\'S </p><p>AND WORLD BANK WARNINGS </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but unclassified, and not for internet </p><p>distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Local Debt Market Sticks with Moral Hazard </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) In the morning of March 12, yields on lira T-bills </p><p>inched upwards to close at 57.5 percent (yesterday\'s close </p><p>was 56.8 percent).  The lira remained unchanged at about TL </p><p>1,620,000 to the dollar.  The Istanbul Stock Exchange was </p><p>down 1 percent in morning trading, after dropping about 1 </p><p>percent on March 11. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Comment: The local debt market is controlled by </p><p>several big players (e.g., AK and Garanti Banks), and they </p><p>are betting on the U.S. financial package regardless of what </p><p>anyone else says (e.g., Moody\'s see below), partly because </p><p>they can\'t sell significant chunks of their already large </p><p>T-bill holdings.  However, investors in the Istanbul Stock </p><p>Exchange, including foreigners and smaller Turkish investors, </p><p>are feeling the stress of the moral hazard and some are </p><p>getting out.  Thus, the ISE may be the more accurate </p><p>barometer of market sentiment at the moment. End Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Warning from Moody\'s </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) In a March 11 interview with Reuters, Moody\'s analyst </p><p>for Turkey Kristin Lindow said the rating agency was </p><p>concerned that the U.S. package "would be off the table if </p><p>they wait another week or so." Lindow added that "if the </p><p>situation deteriorates for the debt costs, then we would </p><p>perhaps initiate a review for a downgrade."  Moody\'s </p><p>currently rates Turkey\'s foreign-currency long-term debt at </p><p>B1 with a negative outlook, and lira-denominated debt at B3. </p><p>Comment: Turkish  bond analysts traders disagree with Moody\'s </p><p>that the Erdogan government will miss the boat on U.S. </p><p>package.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>World Bank Criticism May Slow Down </p><p>Budget Process </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) World Bank Country Director Chhibber, as we reported </p><p>earlier in week, called in a Reuters reporter March 10 to </p><p>say, "This is not a budget that the World Bank will support," </p><p>adding "We think this budget is really quite anti-poor, it </p><p>hurts the farmers...It\'s a budget that supports people who </p><p>don\'t pay taxes because it gives them a tax amnesty...This </p><p>budget is also harmful to growth." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) Chhibber\'s Reuters interview had only a minor impact </p><p>on the markets, but it did anger the GOT and lead to lots of </p><p>press play, including the speculation (in mainstream daily </p><p>Hurriyet March 11) that the USG was behind this World Bank </p><p>criticism as part of its bargaining over the U.S. troop </p><p>deployment.  Babacan, asked by a TV journalist whether this </p><p>was the case, strongly denied any U.S. role in the </p><p>"technical" differences between the GOT and the World Bank. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) On March 11, the World Bank office in Ankara issued a </p><p>clarifying statement that reads in part as follows: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  "The World Bank has been unwavering in its support for </p><p>Turkey, esepcially over the past five years." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  "For the future, the Bank is in broad agreement with the </p><p>Government\'s overall program of macroeconomic stabilization </p><p>and continued structural and social reforms.  The Bank is </p><p>currently discussing with the Government certain issues </p><p>related to sustaining agricultural reofrm and social </p><p>assistance." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) Comment:  Chhibber is not the only critic of this </p><p>draft budget - quite a few analysts agree that it strips </p><p>social spending, which will not be politically palatable for </p><p>long, and will likely depress growth this year.   As World </p><p>Bank resrep Sally Zeillon admitted to us, this harsh public </p><p>criticism is not a usual Bank tactic.  But it may pay off, if </p><p>the GOT agrees to add back into the budget at least TL 1 </p><p>quadrillion of direct income support for farmers, to be </p><p>disbursed in November and December.  WB/GOT talks are </p><p>continuing on the budget.  THis may be used by the GOT later </p><p>as an excuse for not moving forward on passing the budget. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
