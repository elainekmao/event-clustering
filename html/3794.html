<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 005490 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/23/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, XF, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: USINT BAGHDAD CHIEF BERNACKI SAYS IRAQIS ARE </p><p>GETTING READY </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edward W. Gnehm.  Reasons 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) USINT Baghdad Chief Krzysztof Bernacki, in meetings </p><p>with the Ambassador and other Embassy officials on September </p><p>23, provided his latest impressions of life in Baghdad. </p><p>Bernacki, who returned to Baghdad September 6 after a month\'s </p><p>leave, said the Iraqi regime, and average Iraqis themselves, </p><p>are taking steps to prepare for U.S. military action.  More </p><p>security forces have appeared on the streets of the capital </p><p>and Iraqis have begun stockpiling provisions.  Those with the </p><p>means to do so are making plans to leave the capital when </p><p>military operations begin.  Bernacki noted that Iraq\'s recent </p><p>West Asian Football Championship victory provided an </p><p>opportunity to see (and hear) how widespread private gun </p><p>ownership is in Baghdad and how undisciplined Iraqi soldiers </p><p>can be.  After Iraq won the championship, the city was ablaze </p><p>with all variety of gunfire: "I thought the war had started," </p><p>he said.  Finally, he passed on a rumor making the rounds in </p><p>Baghdad diplomatic circles that after the President\'s UNGA </p><p>address, the Saudis offered asylum to Saddam and his family </p><p>-- an offer Saddam turned down.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p>Security on the Streets; Preparations to Get Out of Town </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Bernacki said that he had noticed a significant </p><p>increase of Iraqi security forces -- both uniformed and </p><p>plainclothed -- on the streets of the capital.  While ever </p><p>present before, "one or two are now stationed on every street </p><p>corner."  Security around government buildings and ministries </p><p>has also been beefed up somewhat, from an average of four per </p><p>building to six or eight.  He also reported having seen a </p><p>noticeable increase of individuals he assumes to be </p><p>intelligence officers positioned on the street and in </p><p>buildings near the U.S. Interest Section.  Those increases </p><p>notwithstanding, Bernacki said he has not seen any large </p><p>concentrations of troops moving or otherwise present in the </p><p>center of Baghdad, nor any visible signs of dissent or </p><p>anti-regime behavior (graffiti, etc.) anywhere. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Bernacki said that many people appear to be making use </p><p>of the double rations the government has been distributing </p><p>for the past 2-3 months to stockpile provisions.  He has also </p><p>heard rumors that "people are looking for ways to get out of </p><p>the city when fighting begins.  They are building shelters in </p><p>the countryside."  Asked about how he thought most Iraqis </p><p>would respond to a U.S.-led military action, Bernacki </p><p>predicted that most would neither fight for the regime or </p><p>join an uprising.  They would stay inside their homes and </p><p>when it\'s over "will come out and cheer.  People are fearful </p><p>about what regime change will bring -- whether fighting will </p><p>be swift or prolonged, about the uncertainty of it all -- but </p><p>not about regime change itself." </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p>Has War Begun? No, That\'s Just A Cheer for the Home Team </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Bernacki passed on a vignette about Iraq\'s September 7 </p><p>victory in the West Asian Football Championship that provides </p><p>a vivid example of the extent of private gun ownership in </p><p>Baghdad and the level of discipline (or lack thereof) of the </p><p>Iraqi military.  After the Iraqi team won, "the whole city </p><p>was out firing anything they had.  It went on for about an </p><p>hour an a half."  Bernacki said he saw and heard heavy </p><p>machine gun fire, pistols and other small arms.  He even saw </p><p>anti-aircraft batteries firing wildly into the air: "for a </p><p>minute, I thought the war had begun!  Then I found out it was </p><p>about the game."  Bernacki noted that there is a standing </p><p>Presidential order forbidding anyone from firing weapons into </p><p>the air for celebration, an order that was widely ignored the </p><p>night of the game.  Offering his own interpretation of what </p><p>he had seen and heard, Bernacki observed that "after all they </p><p>have been through over the years, Iraqis badly want to be on </p><p>the winning side.  They want a success." </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>Saudi Offer of Asylum? </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Finally, Bernacki passed on a rumor that has been </p><p>making the rounds in Baghdad\'s diplomatic community. </p><p>According to Russian and Spanish diplomats there, the Saudis </p><p>-- through an envoy dispatched to Baghdad immediately </p><p>following the President\'s UNGA speech -- supposedly offered </p><p>asylum to Saddam and his family in Saudi Arabia.  Saddam, to </p><p>no one\'s great surprise, turned the Saudis down. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
