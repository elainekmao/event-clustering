CHAD DOES NOT ENGAGE IN OR SUPPORT INTERNATIONAL </p><p>TERRORISM.  RATHER, THIS COUNTRY HAS LONG BEEN THE TARGET </p><p>OF TERRORIST ACTIVITIES CARRIED OUT OR SPONSORED BY LIBYA, </p><p>WHOSE ULTIMATE GOAL IS THE DESTRUCTION OF THE HABRE REGIME </p><p>AND THE EXPANSION OF LIBYAN HEGEMONY SOUTHWARD. </p><p> </p><p>2.  LIBYAN TERRORISM HAS BEEN LARGELY INEFFECTIVE OVER </p><p>THE PAST YEAR DUE TO A COMBINATION OF ITS OWN INCOMPE- </p><p>TENCE, THE PRACTICAL DIFFICULTIES OF ACCESS TO THIS </p><p>ISOLATED LAND, AND (MOST IMPORTANT), THE TIRELESS EFFORTS </p><p>OF THE CHADIAN SECURITY SERVICES, WHICH FOILED SEVERAL </p><p>ATTEMPTS TO SMUGGLE ARMS AND EXPLOSIVES INTO THE COUNTRY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  DURING 1987, ONLY TWO ATTEMPTS AT TERRORISM WERE IN </p><p>ANY WAY SUCCESSFUL IN CHAD.  IN MARCH 1987, A LIBYAN- </p><p>SPONSORED TERRORIST ATTEMPTED TO DESTROY A BRIDGE CONNECT- </p><p>ING NDJAMENA TO KOUSSERI IN CAMEROUN.  THE TERRORIST DID </p><p>SUCCEED IN BLOWING HIMSELF UP, BUT ONLY DAMAGED THE </p><p>BRIDGE, WHICH WAS BACK IN LIMITED OPERATION WITHIN HOURS. </p><p>IN OCTOBER 1987, A BUILDING BELONGING TO AN AMERICAN </p><p>PRIVATE VOLUNTEER ORGANIZATION IN THE PROVINCIAL TOWN OF </p><p>MOUNDOU WAS DAMAGED BY AN EXPLOSION FOR WHICH LOCAL </p><p>AUTHORITIES BELIEVE LIBYAN-INSPIRED TERRORISTS WERE </p><p>RESPONSIBLE. </p><p> </p><p>BLANE </p><p></p></div>
