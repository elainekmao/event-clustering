GUATEMALA 971 </p><p>     B. GUATEMALA 1313 </p><p>     C. STATE 186063 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary:  The Ambassador attended the second </p><p>bilateral working group meeting on labor issues with the GOG </p><p>on July 10 and emphasized the need for concrete progress </p><p>prior to submission of a CAFTA to the U.S. Congress.  He </p><p>reiterated USG concern about impunity for violence against </p><p>union leaders, the need to streamline the labor justice </p><p>system, and the importance of enforcing court rulings to </p><p>reinstate workers illegally fired for unionizing activities. </p><p>The GOG reported some progress from the Executive branch </p><p>protecting labor rights, especially in the maquila sector. </p><p>The report of the Special Prosecutor for Crimes Against Trade </p><p>Unionists was disappointing for lack of progress, while </p><p>prospects for expedited reform to the labor justice system </p><p>are not great.  The Ambassador noted international concern, </p><p>including from AFL-CIO President John Sweeny, over the </p><p>imprisonment of Guatemalan labor leader Rigoberto Duenas in </p><p>the Social Security Institute (IGSS) corruption scandal. </p><p>Recognizing that there are few quick fixes to labor rights </p><p>enforcement, we have begun stressing these labor themes to </p><p>opposition candidates in the upcoming elections.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Background </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) The bilateral labor working group was formed at the </p><p>GOG\'s suggestion during a visit by USTR and DOS labor </p><p>officials in March (Ref A).  The first working group meeting </p><p>took place on May 13 (Ref B) and was attended by the GOG, </p><p>Embassy, USTR and USDOL officials.  To maintain momentum on </p><p>outstanding labor issues, the Ambassador requested that the </p><p>MFA convoke the second working group meeting, which took </p><p>place on July 10.  Though initially a response to GSP </p><p>petition review, this meeting coincided with USG "Track Two" </p><p>demarche (Ref C) to encourage improvement in labor rights </p><p>enforcement prior to submission of an eventual CAFTA </p><p>agreement to Congress. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) GOG participants included 24 GOG officials from the </p><p>Labor Ministry, Economy Ministry, Foreign Ministry, Tax </p><p>Authority, FONTIERRAS, Social Security Institute, Attorney </p><p>General\'s Office, Supreme Court and Judiciary, Congress, and </p><p>the Solicitor General\'s Office.  Labor Minister Moreira led </p><p>the GOG side, and explained that, to broaden its range, the </p><p>GOG,s "Multi-institutional Work Committee for Labor </p><p>Relations in Guatemala" had expanded its membership since the </p><p>last bilateral meeting to include the Social Security </p><p>Institute (IGSS), the Fund for Land (FONTIERRAS), the tax </p><p>authority (SAT), and the land dispute resolution body </p><p>(CONTIERRA).  From the GOG, speakers included MFA Director </p><p>General of Bilateral Affairs Jose Arturo Rodriguez, Minister </p><p>of Labor Victor Moreira, Supreme Court Magistrate Otto </p><p>Marroquin,  Labor Court Magistrate Beatriz de Leon de </p><p>Barreda, and Special Prosecutor for Crimes Against </p><p>Journalists and Trade Unionists, Antonio Cortez Sis.  The </p><p>Ambassador was accompanied by LabAtt. </p><p> </p><p>The Ambassdor,s Pitch </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) The Ambassador thanked the group for the </p><p>opportunity to exchange views and shared his perception after </p><p>a recent trip to Washington that concerns about labor rights </p><p>form the greatest challenge to a CAFTA and will be central to </p><p>US Congressional review of a possible CAFTA.  In response to </p><p>a call for comment on labor aspects of CAFTA, several US NGOs </p><p>(WOLA and US/LEAP) and the AFL-CIO had submitted extensive </p><p>commentaries critical of labor rights protections throughout </p><p>the region, which reveal negative perceptions of the issue in </p><p>the U.S. (he provided copies of the three submissions to USTR </p><p>to the group).  The Ambassador told the group that the USG </p><p>had instructed all its embassies in Central America to pursue </p><p>bilateral consultations such as this one to emphasize the </p><p>need for concrete advances to protect labor rights in the </p><p>region, and a senior-level group would be sending the same </p><p>message to Central American ambassadors in Washington.  The </p><p>Ambassador reiterated the USG,s main concerns about labor </p><p>rights protections in Guatemala, emphasizing the damage to </p><p>Guatemala,s international reputation caused by murders of </p><p>labor leaders and impunity;  delays in the labor justice </p><p>system; and the need to enforce labor court sentences </p><p>reinstalling workers illegally fired for unionizing </p><p>activities. </p><p> </p><p>MOL Takes the Lead </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) MFA Director General of Bilateral Affairs Jose </p><p>Arturo Rodriguez turned the meeting over to Labor Minister </p><p>Moreira, who described his ministry\'s efforts to protect </p><p>labor rights.  He listed seven reforms to the Labor Code </p><p>pending in Congress: </p><p> </p><p>a)  Elimination of child labor and the worst forms of labor </p><p>for children; reduction of the work day for children, </p><p>sanctions and fines for violations; </p><p> </p><p>b)  Changing the reference to domestic work to "work in </p><p>private homes;" training in labor rights for these workers; </p><p>and their incorporation into the Social Security system; </p><p> </p><p>c)  Prohibition of sexual harassment and confinement ("acoso </p><p>y hostigamiento sexuales"); procedures to prevent it; and </p><p>making it grounds for dismissal; </p><p> </p><p>d)  Universal severance: severance based on time served (one </p><p>month salary for each year worked) for workers who quit or </p><p>leave voluntarily by mutual agreement;  option for </p><p>reinstallation in cases of unjustified firing; </p><p> </p><p>e)  Procedural code reforms:  strengthening oral procedures; </p><p>shortening the hearing process; eliminating recourse to </p><p>complaints over procedures; reducing the hearing process to </p><p>one non-appealable hearing; embargo of assets of legal </p><p>representatives and partners and associates of accused </p><p>companies; requiring a deposit in cash or guarantee </p><p>sufficient to cover the cost of the demand to lift the </p><p>embargo on assets; obligatory authorization of precautionary </p><p>measures, even before the complaint is heard, or at any time </p><p>during the process; court costs in cases where the complaint </p><p>is for unpaid non-renounceable benefits owed to the worker; </p><p>first oral hearing within two months of presentation of the </p><p>complaint;  (Note:  Moreira argued that by cutting short the </p><p>complaint process the reforms improve efficiency and also </p><p>give employers an incentive to resolve cases out of court. </p><p>Moving precautionary measures to seize employer assets to the </p><p>beginning of the process will also encourage employers to </p><p>settle justified demands without going to court, further </p><p>clearing the clogged labor justice system.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>f)  Creation of the Institute for Public Sector Worker </p><p>Recreation independent of the Labor Ministry (it is currently </p><p>a part of the Ministry); </p><p> </p><p>g)  Creating a fund to administer scholarships for Guatemalan </p><p>workers funded by fees from employers of foreign workers </p><p>($1,282/foreigner/year). </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) The Ambassador congratulated the Minister for the </p><p>reforms, especially the reforms to the labor procedural code, </p><p>which address one of the USG,s main concerns on labor. </p><p>Asked about their status in Congress, Congressional Deputy </p><p>Julio Contreras (FRG) said that the reforms had their first </p><p>reading May 9 and are pending a recommendation of the Labor </p><p>Commission.  That recommendation will be favorable, he said, </p><p>and the reforms will pass to the plenary.  Contreras said he </p><p>was authorized by President of Congress Rios Montt to say the </p><p>FRG has the votes to approve the reforms in August.  He added </p><p>that the FRG will allow amendments in an attempt to achieve </p><p>consensus on the reforms with opposition parties.  Asked by </p><p>the Ambassador if he thought there was any prospect of </p><p>support from the opposition, Contreras said he thinks some </p><p>support will be possible. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) Moreira also described the following MOL actions </p><p>since the first meeting of the bilateral labor working group: </p><p> </p><p>-- He announced the GOG\'s withdrawal of Article 5 of </p><p>Government Accord 60-2002, (announced in February 2002), </p><p>which (reportedly under IMF guidelines) prohibited public </p><p>sector salary increases in collective bargaining agreements </p><p>(Note:  This provision, protested by public sector unions, </p><p>was ruled unconstitutional by the Constitutional Court.  End </p><p>Note.) </p><p> </p><p>-- Institutional Reforms:  modification of the Ministry\'s </p><p>internal regulations and strategic planning processes (a </p><p>strategic plan has been finalized), and restructuring, </p><p>including reclassification of positions and salaries to be </p><p>negotiated with the Ministry\'s union, and new structures to </p><p>address child labor, the implementation of ILO Convention 169 </p><p>on the rights of the indigenous and the handicapped.  He said </p><p>new labor inspectors will be hired by January 2004, raising </p><p>the number of inspectors from 833 to 1300 (130 will be </p><p>dedicated to thematic areas mentioned above).  He said the </p><p>Ministry\'s budget will increase from $7.2 million in 2003 to </p><p>$17.7 million for 2004, and, for the worker recreation fund, </p><p>from $1 million to $2.1 million.  (Comment:  These budget </p><p>increases must be approved by Congress, and could be modified </p><p>by the next government.  End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p>-- Efforts to Address Labor Relations Problems in the Banana </p><p>Sector:  including creation of inter-governmental and </p><p>tripartite committees to discuss structural problems in the </p><p>industry;  defining options for worker-owned cooperatives, as </p><p>provided by Chiquita in Panama, with participation of </p><p>CONTIERRA and FONTIERRAS (the Minister said he would visit </p><p>Panama soon to discuss this program with workers and the </p><p>GOP); advances in collective bargaining negotiations on the </p><p>El Real and El Atlantico plantations, facilitated by a team </p><p>of five new inspectors to supplement existing coverage; and a </p><p>compromise reached through MOL mediation between workers and </p><p>employers in the Bobos district of Morales, Izabal to avoid </p><p>the use of roadblocks in labor conflicts. </p><p> </p><p>-- Efforts in the Maquila Sector:  the MOL has put into </p><p>practice procedures with the Ministry of Economy to denounce </p><p>employers which have failed to comply with labor rights </p><p>obligations, to begin legal procedures and eventual </p><p>withdrawal of tax privileges (30 cases are now pending in the </p><p>Economy Ministry); the first such case processed was against </p><p>Choi Shin/Cimatextiles, which is near resolution (SepTel); a </p><p>sub-commission of this inter-institutional group is meeting </p><p>with employers (VESTEX) and NGOs (FLA, COVERCO) and worker </p><p>representatives to develop responses to problems in the </p><p>sector.  Moreira asserted that its selection of Choi </p><p>Shin/Cimatextiles as the test case was not an effort to </p><p>threaten the only existing unions in the sector, nor was it </p><p>selected for its foreign ownership.  Rather, it was chosen </p><p>because of the strong international attention generated by </p><p>violence at the plants in July 2001, and the management\'s </p><p>lack of compliance with MOL decisions on worker petitions. </p><p>The list of 30 other companies includes many Guatemalan-owned </p><p>firms. </p><p> </p><p>--  The introduction of a 24-hour module on labor rights in </p><p>the second and third grades of secondary school.  The </p><p>Ministry hopes to expand this education effort in future to </p><p>lower grades and to the university level with ILO support. </p><p> </p><p>Little Progress on Impunity </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) Special Prosecutor for Crimes Against Journalists </p><p>and Trade Unionists Antonio Cortez Sis reported that his </p><p>office now consists of himself, two agents and two support </p><p>staff.  He expects one more agent to be assigned soon.  He </p><p>highlighted the following "progress" in several murder cases </p><p>and submitted a list of 100 cases of violence or threats </p><p>against trade unionists received since the Special </p><p>Prosecutor\'s office opened in July 2001, 46 of which have </p><p>been closed as a result the complaint being dropped; other </p><p>cases were transferred to other offices, leaving a total of </p><p>42 cases under investigation. </p><p> </p><p>-- Carlos Francisco Guzman Lanuza ) Secretary General of the </p><p>Union of Municipal Workers of Nueva Concepcion, Escuintla; </p><p>murdered November 27, 2002.  Status:  An ex-municipal council </p><p>member has been arrested for this and other murders.  The </p><p>case has been transferred to Special Prosecutor for </p><p>Corruption for prosecution. </p><p> </p><p>-- Baudilio Amado Cermeno Ramirez ) Light and Power Union; </p><p>murdered December 21, 2001.  The Attorney General\'s Office </p><p>filed a motion contesting the dismissal of the case against </p><p>his live-in lover by the 6th first instance court. </p><p> </p><p>-- Oswaldo Monzon Lima ) General Secretary of the Union of </p><p>Gas Truckers; murdered June 23, 2000.  Status:  His son did </p><p>not show up for a scheduled meeting with prosecutors on July </p><p>7, 2003, despite his offer of witness protection. </p><p> </p><p>-- Baldomero de Jesus Ramirez ) General Secretary of the </p><p>Union of Municipal Workers of Santa Lucia Cotzumalguapa; </p><p>murdered June 22, 1999.  Status:  Meeting planned with the </p><p>Municipal Union of Santa Lucia Cotzumalguapa for 7/15/03 to </p><p>evaluate the request for legal process against Mayor Cesar </p><p>Augusto Duarte Soto as presumed intellectual author of the </p><p>murder. </p><p> </p><p>-- El Arco plantation case ) head wound from machete </p><p>delivered to Marcos Alvarez Tzoc on January 17, 2003.  The </p><p>prosecutors are appealing the judge\'s decision to fine the </p><p>owner of the plantation, Julio Enrique de Jesus Salazar </p><p>Pivaral, $641 for the crime, arguing for jail time.  (Note: </p><p>LabAtt told Cortez that Amnesty International reports more </p><p>recent threats of violence by the owner against workers. </p><p>Cortez was aware of the new threats.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>-- Two SITRABI Witnesses ) subject to death threats </p><p>(presumably from the notorious Mendoza brothers of Morales, </p><p>Izabal, who committed the crime against the SITRABI union and </p><p>paid fines in lieu of jail time).  The two witnesses were </p><p>paroled into the U.S. in 2002 for their protection.  The </p><p>prosecutor wants to send someone to interview them, but has </p><p>not made contact. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU) In response to this underwhelming progress report, </p><p>the Ambassador emphasized the resonance in the U.S. of cases </p><p>of murdered labor leaders.  The strongest argument against </p><p>Guatemala heard in Washington is that labor leaders are being </p><p>killed and nobody is being prosecuted.  He asked Cortez if </p><p>there is any way the USG can help him get results.  Cortez </p><p>responded that he recently took stock of his office\'s efforts </p><p>and is not satisfied with progress made to date.  He assured </p><p>the Ambassador that his office "has the will to advance." </p><p> </p><p>Judiciary </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU) Supreme Court Magistrate Otto Marroquin and Labor </p><p>Court justice Beatriz de Leon de Barreda described efforts by </p><p>the judiciary to expand labor court coverage and train </p><p>justice workers and judges in labor issues.  To improve </p><p>coverage the judiciary has created 22 labor courts, one in </p><p>each departmental capital, and permitted justices of the </p><p>peace in five other municipalities to hear labor disputes, </p><p>bringing the total number of labor courts nationwide to 38. </p><p>It has also trained labor judges in conciliation and </p><p>arbitration of labor disputes.  In addition, there are seven </p><p>labor courts in the capital; one in Coatepeque, which is not </p><p>a provincial capital but is in an area with many labor </p><p>disputes (coffee plantations); three appeals courts in the </p><p>capital and one appeals court in the interior.  This is still </p><p>not enough to meet demand, Marroquin admitted, but funds to </p><p>expand coverage are limited. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (SBU) On another front, the UNDP has funded a study of </p><p>the penal code and pilot reforms in the capital and </p><p>Escuintla, but lacks funding to expand the project.  A </p><p>seminar for judges on ILO conventions was recently held.  In </p><p>addition, the Labor Justice Sub-Commission of the National </p><p>Commission to Strengthen the Justice System, founded by the </p><p>Peace Accords, held a seminar July 3-4 to analyze the need </p><p>for reforms to the labor procedural code.  A report on the </p><p>seminar is being drafted. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (SBU) Marroquin agreed with the Ambassador that the </p><p>issue of non-compliance with judicial sentences is a problem. </p><p> Non-compliance should cause the judge to initiate a penal </p><p>case against the violator, but many times this does not </p><p>happen.  In some cases, severance pay to illegally fired </p><p>employees can cause economic hardship on the employer.  The </p><p>case of Salama Horticulture, cited in the AFL-CIO\'s pending </p><p>GSP petition against Guatemala, is pending in the </p><p>Constitutional Court, where 52 illegally-fired workers have </p><p>appealed an injunction won by the company blocking </p><p>reinstatement. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (SBU) More generally, the judiciary has developed a </p><p>Modernization Plan which includes emphasis on creation of a </p><p>judicial civil service, training of judges and magistrates, </p><p>including in labor issues, and new disciplinary procedures </p><p>for all judicial sector workers.  Computers are being </p><p>distributed to courts around the country.  Meanwhile, the </p><p>judiciary is negotiating a new collective bargaining </p><p>agreement with its employees, the first since 1991. </p><p> </p><p>Rigoberto Duenas, Imprisonment </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>14.  (SBU) Before closing the meeting, the Ambassador raised </p><p>the case of the imprisonment of prominent union leader </p><p>Rigoberto Duenas for his alleged role in the corruption </p><p>scandal surrounding the National Social Security Institute </p><p>(IGSS), where he served as the worker representative on the </p><p>IGSS governing board.  The Ambassador noted that he had </p><p>received 10 letters from the U.S. about Duenas, </p><p>imprisonment, pending a hearing on July 17, including a copy </p><p>of a letter from AFL-CIO President John Sweeny to President </p><p>Portillo requesting a speedy adjudication of the case and </p><p>adequate protection for Duenas in prison.  Cortez responded </p><p>that he had met with union representatives after Duenas was </p><p>jailed, and said responsibility for the case now lies with </p><p>the courts. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>15.  (SBU) The GOG deserves credit for its willingness to </p><p>explore new ways to protect labor rights, but its performance </p><p>in some areas leaves much to be desired.  The new Special </p><p>Prosecutor\'s report was particularly disappointing.  While he </p><p>may be distracted by a recent wave of attacks and threats </p><p>against journalists and short on staff resources, we will </p><p>look for ways to provide material support for labor </p><p>investigations.  Labor justice is another area where </p><p>prospects for rapid change seem dim.  The prospects for </p><p>passage of legislative reforms to shorten the judicial </p><p>process pending in Congress are complicated by the FRG\'s </p><p>ever-narrowing margin and other priorities.  Nevertheless, </p><p>the Labor Justice Sub-commission is doing good work building </p><p>consensus on that issue.  We have recently expanded our labor </p><p>lobbying efforts on the same themes to include labor advisors </p><p>the business group CACIF and to the GANA coalition, the main </p><p>opposition challenger to the FRG in the presidential </p><p>elections, since quick fixes are few and any steps taken by a </p><p>lame-duck administration will need to be expanded by the next </p><p>government, which will take office in January, 2004. </p><p>HAMILTON </p><p></p></div>
