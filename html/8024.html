<p>UNCLAS KATHMANDU 000886 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR SA/INS </p><p>DEPT PLEASE PASS TO USTR, WTO Accessions </p><p>GENEVA PLEASE PASS TO USTR </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, NP, U.S-Nepali Relations </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL:  FOREIGN AND COMMERCE SECRETARIES PLEAD </p><p>FOR US ASSISTANCE ON WTO ACCESSION--ACTION REQUEST </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) Please see paragraph 4 for action request. </p><p> </p><p>GoN Presses Ambassador and DCM for USG Support </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) On a number of recent occasions, Nepal\'s </p><p>Foreign Secretary Madhu Raman Acharya, and Secretary </p><p>for Industry, Commerce, and Supply Lava Devkota, on </p><p>instructions, have raised with both the Ambassador and </p><p>DCM the extent to which Nepal depends on U.S. support </p><p>during the upcoming World Trade Organization (WTO) </p><p>accession negotiations.  They have assured us that they </p><p>are expressing the views of the Foreign Minister, </p><p>Finance Minister, and Prime Minister.  These separate </p><p>entreaties followed similar talking points: </p><p>-- The Cabinet process on implementing legislation is </p><p>moving forward; </p><p>-- The current, interim government of monarchial </p><p>appointees is especially well suited to taking the </p><p>difficult policy decisions required for accession; </p><p>--Any future government formed after the reconstitution </p><p>of Parliament, of whatever political complexion, would </p><p>honor the WTO commitments made now; </p><p>-- The Nepalese leadership believes that Nepal has no </p><p>chance of accession without U.S. backing; </p><p>-- From the GoN\'s perspective there are no major issues </p><p>in the bilateral negotiations; and </p><p>-- Nepal is acutely aware that Cambodia (the other </p><p>least developed country candidate up for WTO membership </p><p>by the September Ministerial in Cancun) looks better by </p><p>comparison. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) In Post\'s review of Nepal\'s recently </p><p>submitted WTO negotiation documents, there appear to be </p><p>some efforts to meet WTO mandates and U.S. bilateral </p><p>requests.  We understand that specific stumbling blocks </p><p>to agreement remain.  The GoN\'s earnest entreaties </p><p>provide an opportunity to close the gap, using </p><p>representations by the Embassy to prepare the GoN </p><p>better for the May 23 round of U.S.-Nepal bilateral </p><p>negotiations. </p><p> </p><p>Action Request </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Post requests talking points that respond to </p><p>the GoN\'s pleas to help clarify the outstanding U.S.- </p><p>Nepal WTO issues.  These talking points could be </p><p>delivered to the Secretaries and Ministers of the </p><p>Foreign Ministry and the Ministry of Industry, Commerce </p><p>and Supply.  The messages conveyed could serve two </p><p>ends:  to deliver the U.S. Trade Representative\'s </p><p>points directly to the Ministries responsible for </p><p>writing Nepal\'s concessions, and to allow the Embassy </p><p>to engage GoN principals on more specific items of </p><p>contention in the negotiations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BOGGS </p><p></p></div>
