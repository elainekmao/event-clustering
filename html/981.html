<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 CARACAS 003816 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/14/08 </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, PGOV, VE, BR, AR, CI, CO </p><p>SUBJECT:  CHAVEZ VICTORY LAP AROUND THE REGION </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) STATE 233224, (B) BRASILIA 4779, (C) BUENOS AIRES 6552, </p><p>(D) BUENOS AIRES 6606 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY THOMAS A. SHANNON, POLITICAL COUNSELOR.  REASON: </p><p>1.5(D). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (U)  PRESIDENT-ELECT HUGO CHAVEZ PAID POST ELECTION COURTESY </p><p>CALLS ON ARGENTINE PRESIDENT CARLOS MENEM, CHILEAN PRESIDENT </p><p>EDUARDO FREI, BRAZILIAN PRESIDENT HENRIQUE CARDOZO, AND COLOMBIAN </p><p>PRESIDENT CARLOS PASTRANA DURING A DECEMBER 15-18 WHIRLWIND </p><p>REGIONAL TOUR OF BRAZIL (REF B), ARGENTINA (REFS C AND D), AND </p><p>COLOMBIA.  DURING THE TRIP HE EMPHASIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF </p><p>INTEGRATION, ANNOUNCED THAT VENEZUELA WOULD CONSIDER SEEKING ENTRY </p><p>TO MERCOSUR INDEPENDENT OF ITS ANDEAN COMMUNITY PARTNERS IF ANDEAN </p><p>PACT NEGOTIATIONS WITH MERCOSUR DID NOT SPEED UP, RESURRECTED THE </p><p>IDEA OF CREATING A VENEZUELAN-BRAZILIAN BINATIONAL PETROLEUM </p><p>COMPANY (LATER EXTENDING THE PROPOSAL TO COLOMBIA AS WELL), AND </p><p>ANNOUNCED PRE-INAUGURATION PLANS TO VISIT THE UNITED STATES AND </p><p>EUROPE TO ADVERTISE HIS GOVERNMENT\'S OPENNESS TO INTERNATIONAL </p><p>INVESTMENT.  IN COLOMBIA, CHAVEZ URGED THE COLOMBIAN INSURGENTS TO </p><p>DISARM, AND "OPEN THE ROAD TO PEACE."  CHAVEZ\' MERCOSUR REMARKS </p><p>SPARKED CONTROVERSY AT HOME AND CONSTERNATION IN COLOMBIA.  HE </p><p>SOUGHT TO SMOOTH RUFFLED FEATHERS BY CASTING HIS REMARKS IN LIGHT </p><p>OF THE IMPORTANCE OF REGIONAL INTEGRATION, BUT LEFT CLEAR THAT </p><p>VENEZUELA WOULD NOT ALLOW ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH MERCOSUR TO BE HELD </p><p>HOSTAGE BY ANDEAN PACT NEGOTIATIONS.   END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>MERCOSUR A "STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE" </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (U)  CHAVEZ BEGAN HIS TRIP ON DECEMBER 15 IN BRAZIL WHERE HE </p><p>RAISED THE POSSIBILITY THAT VENEZUELA MIGHT UNILATERALLY SEEK TO </p><p>JOIN MERCOSUR (REF B).  MEETING WITH MENEM AND FREI IN BUENOS AIRES </p><p>ON DECEMBER 16, CHAVEZ DECLARED VENEZUELA\'S INCORPORATION INTO </p><p>MERCOSUR AS A "STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE" THAT WILL "CONTRIBUTE TO </p><p>DEEPENING THE PROCESS OF LATIN AMERICAN INTEGRATION" (REF C).  THE </p><p>PRESIDENT-ELECT PROPOSED THAT VENEZUELA\'S INTEGRATION INTO MERCOSUR </p><p>SHOULD OCCUR IN TWO PHASES, BEGINNING WITH AN AGREEMENT SIMILAR TO </p><p>THAT OF CHILE\'S, THEN MOVING FORWARD TO FULL INCORPORATION. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>MERCOSUR STATEMENTS PROVOKE CONCERN </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (U)  CHAVEZ\' MERCOSUR COMMENTS IN ARGENTINA AND BRAZIL PROVOKED </p><p>STRONG NEGATIVE REACTION AMONG VARIOUS QUARTERS IN VENEZUELA. </p><p>PUBLIC REACTIONS REFLECTED CONCERN THAT VENEZUELA WILL RENEGE ON </p><p>ITS OBLIGATIONS AS A MEMBER OF THE ANDEAN COMMUNITY TO NEGOTIATE AS </p><p>A UNIFIED GROUP A FREE TRADE AGREEMENT WITH MERCOSUR.  FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER MIGUEL ANGEL BURELLI RIVAS--WHO SAID THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>PRESS MAY HAVE MISCOMMUNICATED CHAVEZ\'S WORDS--SAID THE GOV HAS </p><p>TREATY OBLIGATIONS WITH THE ANDEAN PACT WHICH IT CANNOT </p><p>UNILATERALLY PUT ASIDE.  HIS CRITICISMS WERE REPEATED BY OTHER </p><p>VENEZUELAN LEADERS OF COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY WHO URGED THAT </p><p>VENEZUELA REMAIN IN THE ANDEAN COMMUNITY, EVENTUALLY NEGOTIATING </p><p>INTEGRATION WITH MERCOSUR AS A BLOC. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>SPECTRE OF ADJUDICATION AND SANCTIONS RAISED </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (U)  THE PRESIDENT OF VENEZUELA\'S FOREIGN TRADE COUNCIL, SILVANO </p><p>GELLENI, SPECULATED THAT VENEZUELA COULD BE BROUGHT BEFORE THE </p><p>ANDEAN COURT OF JUSTICE BY THE ANDEAN COMMUNITY IF IT WERE TO </p><p>ATTEMPT UNILATERALLY TO JOIN MERCOSUR.  HE ALSO MENTIONED POSSIBLE </p><p>SANCTIONS FOR VIOLATING THE AGREEMENT, INCLUDING THE IMPOSITION OF </p><p>TARIFFS AND OTHER TRADE RESTRICTIONS.  THE VENEZUELAN CHAMBER OF </p><p>COMMERCE (CONSECOMERCIO), THE VENEZUELAN-COLOMBIAN ECONOMIC </p><p>INTEGRATION COMMISSION, THE FEDERATION OF CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE </p><p>(FEDECAMERAS), AND THE ASSOCIATION OF VENEZUELAN CHEMICAL AND </p><p>PETROCHEMICAL INDUSTRIES ALSO ISSUED STATEMENTS CRITICAL OF CHAVEZ\' </p><p>DECLARATIONS ON MERCOSUR, AND STRONGLY SUPPORTED CONTINUED </p><p>COOPERATION WITH THE ANDEAN COMMUNITY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>REAFFIRMS ANDEAN PACT COMMITMENTS </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (U)  FOLLOWING THESE CRITICISMS, CHAVEZ SAID HE WAS NOT </p><p>ADVOCATING THE VIOLATION OF AGREEMENTS PREVIOUSLY ARRIVED AT WITHIN </p><p>THE ANDEAN COMMUNITY.  HOWEVER, HE SAID THAT HE WOULD DO WHATEVER </p><p>HE COULD TO ADVANCE THE INTEGRATION OF VENEZUELA AND THE OTHER </p><p>MEMBERS OF THE ANDEAN COMMUNITY WITH MERCOSUR.  THE PRESIDENT-ELECT </p><p>ALSO COMMENTED THAT HE WOULD BE MAKING A TRIP TO THE UNITED STATES </p><p>AND EUROPE PROBABLY BEFORE HIS FEBRUARY 2 INAUGURATION TO PERSUADE </p><p>INVESTORS THAT HE WAS NOT A "BRUTAL EXTREMIST."  HE ADDED THAT </p><p>"INVESTORS FROM ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD ARE WELCOME," AND THAT HIS </p><p>GOVERNMENT COULD USE THE INVESTMENTS TO REDUCE THE FISCAL DEFICIT </p><p>AND HELP FINANCE THE CONSTRUCTION OF INFRASTRUCTURAL PROJECTS. </p><p>CHAVEZ ALSO SAID HE WANTED TO FIND WAYS TO REDUCE VENEZUELA\'S </p><p>DEPENDENCE ON PETROLEUM EXPORTS BY STRENGTHENING THE AGRICULTURAL </p><p>AND TOURISM SECTORS, AND BY DEVELOPING A PETRO-CHEMICAL INDUSTRY. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>BINATIONAL PETROLEUM COMPANY WITH BRAZIL </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  PRESIDENT-ELECT CHAVEZ PROPOSED TO BRAZILIAN LEADERS THE </p><p>CREATION OF A BINATIONAL PETROLEUM COMPANY, CALLED "PETROAMERICA." </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER BURELLI REACTED POSITIVELY TO THE IDEA, BUT </p><p>UNDERSCORED THAT IT WAS NOT ORIGINAL, AND HAD BEEN PROPOSED AT THE </p><p>1994 SUMMIT OF THE AMERICAS IN MIAMI.  BURELLI EXPRESSED HIS HOPE </p><p>THAT IDEAS INITIATED DURING HIS TERM, LIKE THE BINATIONAL PETROLEUM </p><p>COMPANY, WOULD BECOME REALITIES DURING THE NEXT ADMINISTRATION. </p><p>CHAVEZ FURTHER SPOKE OF VENEZUELA\'S POTENTIAL IN THE AREAS OF </p><p>AGRICULTURE, LIVESTOCK, AND TOURISM, AND THE POSSIBILITY OF </p><p>MUTUALLY DEVELOPING THEIR SHARED BORDER AREAS. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>RAPID ANDEAN INTEGRATION WITH MERCOSUR </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (U)  CHAVEZ TRAVELED TO COLOMBIA ON DECEMBER 17 AND 18 WHERE HE </p><p>CONTINUED TO PUSH THE THEME OF REGIONAL INTEGRATION, URGING THE </p><p>ACCELERATION OF AN ANDEAN COMMUNITY AGREEMENT WITH MERCOSUR.  HE </p><p>ADVISED A GROUP OF COLOMBIAN BUSINESSMEN THAT "WE CAN\'T GET BOGGED </p><p>DOWN IN TECHNICAL DISCUSSIONS WHILE THE WORLD ADVANCES."  COLOMBIAN </p><p>BUSINESS AND GOVERNMENT LEADERS--CONSCIOUS OF THE VULNERABILITY OF </p><p>ANDEAN ECONOMIES IN RELATION TO THE MORE MATURE ECONOMIES OF </p><p>ARGENTINA AND BRAZIL--GREETED CHAVEZ\' EXHORTATIONS CAUTIOUSLY.  IN </p><p>AN EFFORT TO REASSURE COLOMBIAN INVESTORS, CHAVEZ GUARANTEED CLEAR </p><p>RULES FOR INVESTMENT IN CONSTRUCTION, ENERGY AND TOURISM.  HE ALSO </p><p>PROPOSED THE INCLUSION OF THE COLOMBIAN PETROLEUM COMPANY, </p><p>ECOPETROL, INTO THE EVENTUAL ALLIANCE BETWEEN THE BRAZILIAN AND </p><p>VENEZUELAN OIL CONCERNS. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>CALLS ON COLOMBIAN GUERRILLAS TO DISARM </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (U)  CHAVEZ ALSO ENGAGED THE ISSUE OF THE COLOMBIAN PEACE </p><p>PROCESS, OFFERING HIS GOOD OFFICES TO FACILITATE THE PROCESS, BUT </p><p>INSISTING THAT HE HAS NOT HAD DIRECT CONTACT WITH EITHER COLOMBIAN </p><p>GUERRILLA GROUP.  COLOMBIAN INSURGENTS PUBLICLY PASSED THEIR </p><p>RESPECTS TO CHAVEZ, EXPRESSING THEIR SATISFACTION AT HIS ELECTION, </p><p>AND CITING HIS VICTORY AS "AN EXAMPLE FOR ALL OF LATIN AMERICA." </p><p>CHAVEZ RESPONDED THAT HE HAD RECEIVED THEIR PUBLIC MESSAGES WITH </p><p>"GREAT SENTIMENT, RESPONSIBILITY AND UNITY," AND THAT HE WOULD LIKE </p><p>TO RETURN THE SENTIMENT, "BUT CARRYING THE SIGN OF PEACE."  HE </p><p>URGED THE REBELS TO "DISARM AND HAVE THE COURAGE TO OPEN THE PATH </p><p>OF PEACE."  FINALLY, CHAVEZ CALLED FOR A PROFOUND DIALOGUE AND </p><p>ANALYSIS OF THE SITUATION IN COLOMBIA, VENEZUELA, AND THE ENTIRE </p><p>CONTINENT." </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>STATEMENTS ON MERCOSUR CAUSE CONFUSION </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (C)  CHAVEZ\' VARIOUS STATEMENTS REGARDING MERCOSUR CONFUSED GOV </p><p>OFFICIALS.  ECONOMIC COUNSELOR AND TRADE OFFICER MET DECEMBER 18 </p><p>WITH MINISTRY OF INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE DIRECTOR OF INTERNAL </p><p>ECONOMIC RELATIONS JOSE ANTONIO MARTINEZ.  ECONOFFS ASKED IF </p><p>CHAVEZ\' COMMENTS IN BRAZIL INDICATED A "FOUR-PLUS-ONE" APPROACH TO </p><p>VENEZUELA\'S NEGOTIATIONS WITH MERCOSUR OR IF HIS COMMENTS IN </p><p>COLOMBIA INDICATED A "FOUR-PLUS-FOUR" APPROACH.  MARTINEZ SAID HE </p><p>DID NOT KNOW SINCE CHAVEZ\' STATEMENTS APPEARED TO DEPEND ON "WHAT </p><p>COUNTRY HE IS IN."  ECONOFFS THEN ASKED IF THE CHAVEZ TRADE </p><p>TRANSITION TEAM LED BY MOVEMENT TOWARDS SOCIALISM (MAS) CONGRESSMAN </p><p>GUSTAVO MARQUEZ INDICATED WHICH WAY CHAVEZ WAS LEANING.  MARTINEZ </p><p>AGAIN SAID HE DID NOT KNOW.  "WE PROVIDE INFORMATION TO THEM," HE </p><p>EXPLAINED, "BUT THEY DO NOT PROVIDE ANY INFORMATION BACK TO US." </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>ADVOCATES MEMBERSHIP IN MULTIPLE COMMUNITIES </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11. (C)  CHAVEZ CLARIFIED HIS TRADE POLICY AT THE VENEZUELAN- </p><p>AMERICAN CHAMBER OF COMMERCE (VENAMCHAM) GENERAL ASSEMBLY ON </p><p>DECEMBER 19.  HE STRESSED THAT HE WOULD SEEK VENEZUELA\'S MEMBERSHIP </p><p>IN MERCOSUR, SIMILAR TO THE MEMBERSHIP OF CHILE AND BOLIVIA, WHILE </p><p>MAINTAINING VENEZUELA\'S ANDEAN COMMUNITY COMMITMENTS.  "IF BOLIVIA </p><p>CAN BE A MEMBER OF MERCOSUR AND REMAIN PART OF THE ANDEAN </p><p>COMMUNITY," HE ARGUED, "SO CAN VENEZUELA."  HE CONTINUED, "IF </p><p>VENEZUELA CAN BE A MEMBER OF THE G-3 AND REMAIN A MEMBER OF THE </p><p>ANDEAN COMMUNITY," HE CONTINUED, "IT CAN ALSO BE A MEMBER OF </p><p>MERCOSUR." </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>PUSHED ANDEAN COMMUNITY TOWARD INTEGRATION </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>12. (U)  SHORTLY AFTERWARDS, CHAVEZ PRACTICALLY ISSUED AN ULTIMATUM </p><p>REGARDING NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE ANDEAN PACT AND MERCOSUR.  HE </p><p>SAID IF TALKS TO ACHIEVE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE TWO BLOCKS WERE NOT </p><p>ACCELERATED, VENEZUELA WOULD TAKE THE SAME COURSE AS BOLIVIA AND </p><p>JOIN MERCOSUR WHILE REMAINING A MEMBER OF THE ANDEAN COMMUNITY. </p><p>CHAVEZ SAID VENEZUELA HAD A VISION WITH RESPECT TO THE GEOPOLITICAL </p><p>ENVIRONMENT AND THE AGREEMENTS SIGNED WITH THE GROUP OF THREE (G- </p><p>3), THE CARIBBEAN COMMUNITY COMMON MARKET (CARICOM), AND ANDEAN </p><p>COMMUNITY.  "WE WILL ACCELERATE THE INTEGRATION PROCESS, WHICH I </p><p>HOPE WILL TAKE PLACE AS A BLOCK," CHAVEZ SAID, "BUT THERE ARE OTHER </p><p>OPTIONS."  HE NOTED, "SHOULD THE TALKS REMAIN DEADLOCKED, VENEZUELA </p><p>WILL JOIN MERCOSUR WITHOUT LEAVING THE ANDEAN COMMUNITY." </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) THE PURPOSE OF CHAVEZ\' TRIP WAS TWO-FOLD:  EXTERNALLY TO </p><p>ENGAGE IMMEDIATELY WITH KEY SOUTH AMERICAN COUNTRIES AND ALLAY </p><p>FEARS RAISED BY CHAVEZ\' PERSONAL HISTORY AND CAMPAIGN RHETORIC. </p><p>DOMESTICALLY, TO PORTRAY CHAVEZ AS A PRESIDENT-ELECT WELCOMED IN </p><p>SOUTH AMERICA\'S MAJOR CAPITALS AND FOCUSED ON THE MAJOR AGENDA </p><p>ITEMS IN REGIONAL DIPLOMACY. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C) WITH THE EXCEPTION OF CHAVEZ\' COMMENTS ON MERCOSUR, THE </p><p>TRIP WAS WITHOUT INCIDENT.  FOREIGN MINISTRY OFFICIALS, WHOSE ROLE </p><p>IN THE PLANNING AND EXECUTION OF THE TRIP WAS MINIMAL, WERE HAPPY </p><p>THAT CHAVEZ SEEMED TO AGREE AND TO RATIFY CURRENT GOV POLICY TOWARD </p><p>THE COUNTRIES VISITED.  SOME COMPLAINED THAT HIS MERCOSUR COMMENTS </p><p>HAD UNNECESSARILY UPSET COLOMBIA.  HOWEVER, THEY NOTED THAT HE HAD </p><p>MADE AN EFFORT DURING HIS VISIT TO BOGOTA TO SMOOTH WHATEVER </p><p>FEATHERS HE HAD RUFFLED BY CASTING HIS MERCOSUR REMARKS IN LIGHT OF </p><p>ONGOING REGIONAL ECONOMIC INTEGRATION. </p><p> </p><p>15.  (C) FROM OUR POINT OF VIEW, TWO ASPECTS OF THE TRIP WORTH </p><p>NOTING ARE:  FIRST, THE TRIP DEMONSTRATES THE IMPORTANCE CHAVEZ </p><p>PLACES ON REGIONAL ISSUES, AND HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH OTHER </p><p>COUNTRIES.  HE IS CLEARLY EAGER TO BE ACCEPTED AS A MEMBER IN GOOD </p><p>STANDING OF THE LATIN AMERICAN AND INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITIES.  THIS </p><p>INDICATES THAT HE WOULD THINK TWICE BEFORE ADOPTING POLICIES OR </p><p>POLITICAL MEASURES AT HOME THAT MIGHT OFFEND HIS DEMOCRATIC </p><p>NEIGHBORS.  SECOND, CHAVEZ MADE CLEAR THAT HE WILL NOT ALLOW </p><p>VENEZUELA\'S RELATIONS WITH MERCOSUR TO BE HELD HOSTAGE BY ANDEAN </p><p>PACT NEGOTIATIONS WHICH HAVE DRAGGED ON FOR THREE YEARS.  HE HAS </p><p>PUT HIS NEIGHBORS ON NOTICE THAT THE GOV WILL TAKE A MORE ASSERTIVE </p><p>ROLE WITHIN THE ANDEAN PACT, AND IS PREPARED TO ACT UNILATERALLY TO </p><p>MEET NATIONAL INTERESTS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MASON </p><p></p></div>
