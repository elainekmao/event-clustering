<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 002862 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, EB, EUR/SE, NEA/NGA </p><p>STATE PASS NSC FOR QUANRUD AND BRYZA </p><p>USDOC FOR 4212/ITA/MAC/OEURA/CPD/DDEFALCO </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/30/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, ETRD, EAIR, PREL, TU, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKISH MFA ON IRAQ RECONSTRUCTION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 2817 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by EconCouns Scot Marciel, Reason 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary:  MFA Director for Iraq Reconstruction Okcun </p><p>told EconCouns April 29 that Turkey would pursue an </p><p>aggressive private/public sector approach to winning </p><p>reconstruction contracts in Iraq.  He asked if the U.S. could </p><p>help by dispelling the notion that Turkish firms were at a </p><p>disadvantage due to Turkey,s stance on the war, and by </p><p>"matchmaking" between Turkish and U.S. firms.  Okcun noted </p><p>that Turkey hoped to normalize trade relations with Iraq as </p><p>soon as possible, and would reopen its embassy in Baghdad the </p><p>week of May 5.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) EconCouns met April 29 with MFA Director for Iraq </p><p>Reconstruction Ambassador Okcun, DDG for Bilateral Economic </p><p>Affairs for the Middle East/Africa Kaya Turkmen, and DDG for </p><p>Bilateral Economic Affairs for the West Mehmet Gucuk.  Okcun </p><p>noted that the MFA,s goal was to help secure the </p><p>participation of Turkish companies in the reconstruction of </p><p>Iraq through aggressive "public/private sector teamwork." </p><p>The MFA had already established a permanent commission of </p><p>eight members -- four from the private sector, four from the </p><p>state sector -- to work on Iraq reconstruction issues.  The </p><p>commission would convene regular meetings to discuss </p><p>opportunities and challenges in key sectors, i.e. </p><p>transportation, banking, and oil. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Okcun noted that participating in Iraq reconstruction </p><p>would be more difficult for Turkish firms than it had been in </p><p>Afghanistan.  He said the GOT would pursue an aggressive </p><p>approach, and would encourage the private sector to do the </p><p>same.  He asked if the U.S. could help in this effort by </p><p>taking steps to dispel the persistent notion in the press and </p><p>the private sector that Turkish firms were at a disadvantage </p><p>due to Turkey,s stance on the war.  Okcun also requested </p><p>U.S. assistance in "matchmaking" between Turkish and U.S. </p><p>firms, perhaps by organizing a reconstruction conference in </p><p>Turkey, as we had done in the Afghanistan case. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Okcun noted that Turkey planned to resume normal trade </p><p>relations with Iraq as soon as possible.  To this end, the </p><p>government hoped to open a second border gate to help ease </p><p>the traffic through Harbur gate, but needed an interlocutor </p><p>on the Iraqi side in order to proceed with the plan.  Okcun </p><p>said the GOT also hoped to extend a railway line directly </p><p>across the Iraqi border.  The current railway system, he </p><p>said, went through Syria first and then into Iraq.  He </p><p>expected Turkish Airlines would also be interested in </p><p>resuming flights to Baghdad whenever that became possible. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) On other Iraq-related issues, DG Turkmen noted that </p><p>the GOT was planning on reopening its embassy -- staffed with </p><p>a skeleton crew for now -- in Baghdad the week of May 5. </p><p>Okcun said he understood that other countries were planning </p><p>on sending representatives to work with ORHA, and Turkey also </p><p>wanted to one to two officials.  He said the MFA would </p><p>contact us when its proposal was more firm.  Okcun claimed </p><p>there was an understanding following Secretary Powell,s </p><p>visit that we would help arrange a meeting for GOT officials </p><p>with General Garner.  He said the GOT was willing to send a </p><p>delegation to Baghdad as soon as possible for such a meeting. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
