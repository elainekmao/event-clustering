<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 000552 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL:03/20/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MARR, NI </p><p>SUBJECT:  NIGERIA OPEN TO DISCUSSION OF ARTICLE 98 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REFS: (A) 02 STATE 192375 </p><p>  (B) STATE 22119 </p><p>  (C) 02 ABUJA 2872 </p><p>  (D) 02 ABUJA 2978 </p><p>  (E) ABUJA 328 </p><p>  (F) ABUJA 342 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER. REASON 1.5(b). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary:  Embassy efforts to obtain GON signature to </p><p>an Article 98 Agreement continue despite initial resistance </p><p>and skepticism in several GON quarters.  The Ambassador most </p><p>recently raised the subject on March 20, this time with MFA </p><p>PermSec Hart.  Hart voiced strong "personal" reservations but </p><p>said the GON was open to discussion.  We doubt the threat of </p><p>ASPA-based sanctions will move the GON, but its own interests </p><p>might.  We continue to pursue this key objective </p><p>energetically.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>STRATEGY </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) The GON was deeply involved in the establishment of </p><p>the International Criminal Court (ICC), and Nigeria offered a </p><p>candidate (who lost) for one of the seats.   Ministry of </p><p>Foreign Affairs (MFA) resistance to an Article 98 Agreement </p><p>was anticipated.  Thus, Mission strategy in pursuit of an </p><p>agreement foresaw approaching others in the GON before </p><p>engaging with MFA.  Indeed, an early mention of Article 98 had </p><p>produced very strong opposition from Foreign Minister Sule </p><p>Lamido (Ref C). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>DEMARCHES </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) In October and November of last year, the Ambassador </p><p>raised Article 98 with National Security Advisor LTG Aliyu </p><p>Mohammed (ret) and Minister of Defense LTG Theophilus Yakubu </p><p>Danjuma (ret), providing each with a draft agreement for </p><p>consideration.  Mohammed (Ref C) was interested in exploring </p><p>possibilities and encouraged us to engage with Danjuma and </p><p>Minister of Justice Kanu Godwin Agabi.  The Ambassador </p><p>stressed that, as a major contributor to PKOs in Africa and </p><p>beyond, Nigeria\'s national interest might be well-served by </p><p>signing Article 98 agreements with other countries as well, </p><p>particularly countries in ECOWAS. Danjuma (ref D) expressed </p><p>some doubt and said he would discuss the matter with FM </p><p>Lamido. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) In a meeting at the end of January, Agabi (Ref E) took </p><p>on board the Ambassador\'s points, including those about the </p><p>ASPA, and promised to acquaint President Obasanjo with the </p><p>issue.  We left a draft Article 98 Agreement with Agabi also. </p><p>The Ambassador and AF DAS Bridgewater raised Article 98 with </p><p>Obasanjo on February 14 (Ref F).  Initially criticizing the </p><p>USG for not being a member of the ICC, Obasanjo became more </p><p>receptive to Article 98 as the discussion proceeded.  At the </p><p>end, he instructed his International Affairs Advisor (Ad\'Obe </p><p>Obe) to ask FM Sule Lamido to convene an Inter-Ministerial </p><p>Committee to examine whether Nigeria should enter into an </p><p>Article 98 Agreement. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>CONTINUED RESISTANCE </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) The Ambassador, accompanied by DCM, March 20 made a </p><p>strong pitch for Article 98 to MFA Permanent Secretary Dan </p><p>Hart.  Hart explained that Nigeria had played an important </p><p>role in the establishment of the ICC and strongly backed its </p><p>principles.  The Ambassador responded that the USG had no </p><p>objection to the principles behind the ICC and that Article 98 </p><p>Agreements were bilateral accords for which the Rome Statute </p><p>specifically provides.  The Ambassador related to Hart the </p><p>substance of his meeting with Obasanjo (Ref F) and wondered </p><p>whether the Inter-Ministerial Committee had been formed.  Hart </p><p>said it had not.  He welcomed the Ambassador\'s offer of a </p><p>draft Article 98 Agreement and other materials, adding that he </p><p>was certain the matter would be discussed within the GON </p><p>"before long." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) In response to the Ambassador\'s point that Nigeria </p><p>might have its own strong interest in concluding Article 98 </p><p>Agreements with countries in the region, Hart commented that </p><p>he "personally" was not concerned about the possibility of </p><p>Nigerian troops being convicted of war crimes if they had </p><p>committed them.  War must be conducted to "correct and humane </p><p>standards," he added.  The Ambassador replied that the U.S. </p><p>agreed completely but took a different approach; accusations </p><p>of war crimes should be addressed in national courts or by </p><p>special-purpose ad-hoc bodies established to respond to the </p><p>results of a particular conflict situation.  The U.S. believed </p><p>that the Rome Statute had gone too far, could be manipulated </p><p>for political purposes, and infringe on national sovereignty </p><p>issues. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) COMMENT:  MFA opposes Article 98 and is not in any </p><p>hurry to convene an Inter-Ministerial Committee.  We will </p><p>again raise President Obasanjo\'s mid-February instruction with </p><p>Obe in the near future.  However, progress in a positive </p><p>direction is very unlikely as long as the war in Iraq </p><p>continues.  We do not think the threat of ASPA sanctions will </p><p>motivate the GON to conclude an agreement with us.  Obasanjo, </p><p>who seemed not to fully understand the ICC\'s mandate ("The </p><p>International Criminal Court is fine for drug traffickers, </p><p>money launderers and the like, but I\'m not sure it\'s right for </p><p>the military."), clearly was open to considering an Article 98 </p><p>Agreement with the U.S. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) For now, our approach will be to prod the various </p><p>players gently to gather in their Inter-Ministerial forum and </p><p>discuss Article 98 in the context of Nigeria\'s role in PKOs in </p><p>Africa and beyond.  We will, of course, ensure that they are </p><p>aware of the provisions of ASPA, but we will not make these </p><p>provisions a central theme. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
