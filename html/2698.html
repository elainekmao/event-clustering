<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 000634 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/28/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PGOV, PTER, MARR, ASEC, PREL, PINR, NP, Human Rights </p><p>SUBJECT: SUSPECTED TORTURE, EXTRA-JUDICIAL KILLING BY ROYAL </p><p>NEPALESE ARMY </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMBASSADOR MICHAEL E. MALINOWSKI, REASONS 1.5(B),(D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (S) Summary.  Evidence that Royal Nepalese Army (RNA) </p><p>personnel brutalized and killed one man they suspected of </p><p>being a Maoist has spurred private investigations into the </p><p>army\'s alleged practice of covering up the deaths of </p><p>detainees.  Military attaches from the U.S. and U.K. </p><p>Embassies viewed the corpse of one man who evidently had been </p><p>shot through the head after suffering a sustained beating. </p><p>Residents of the man\'s village told a team of human rights </p><p>activists that army personnel had picked him and four others </p><p>off the street.  The next morning his body turned up in a </p><p>Kathmandu morgue and attracted the attention of a doctor </p><p>affiliated with a group that works with torture victims. </p><p>Asked by a British military attache to investigate the </p><p>incident, a high-ranking RNA officer replied that the man had </p><p>been shot while trying to run away.  The extent to which </p><p>high-ranking RNA officers are aware of such incidents remains </p><p>unclear.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Investigations Into RNA Abuse In Kathmandu Valley </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) The GON,s Human Rights Commission, the Center for </p><p>Victims of Torture (CVICT) and local human rights </p><p>organizations are investigating reports that Royal Nepalese </p><p>Army (RNA) personnel have tortured and summarily executed </p><p>individuals they suspect of supporting the Maoist cause.  The </p><p>RNA has allegedly released the names of such individuals as </p><p>having been killed in a clash with or in flight from security </p><p>forces.  The case of one man in particular attracted the </p><p>attention of Kathmandu-based organizations after his body </p><p>turned up at Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital in the </p><p>capital early on the morning of March 16.  A doctor who </p><p>viewed the body upon reporting for work later that morning </p><p>related what he saw to the head of CVICT. </p><p> </p><p>Signs of Beating, Gunshot Wounds </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) Emboffs, in the company of British Embassy officials, </p><p>visited the hospital March 20 and met with the doctor who </p><p>reported the condition of the corpse to CVICT.  DATT and </p><p>British Assistant Military Attache (AMA) then viewed the </p><p>body, which was still in the morgue.  Afterwards, the British </p><p>AMA described viewing an individual in his late twenties or </p><p>early thirties with multiple blunt-trauma contusions to the </p><p>face, shoulders, arms and hands.  The blows to the arms and </p><p>hands were apparently inflicted while the man was sitting in </p><p>a chair.  He had a small puncture wound in one calf and a </p><p>mark on his neck which looked as if it had been made by a </p><p>strip of cloth, but his skin was otherwise unbroken.  Cause </p><p>of death was four gunshot wounds, three in the back and one </p><p>through the head, the British military officer stated. </p><p>(Note:  On March 27 AMA related to Poloff that he had asked </p><p>the RNA Director of Military Operations (DMO) to investigate </p><p>the incident.  In his reply, the DMO stated that the man had </p><p>been shot while trying to run away.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>Villagers Report Army Sweep </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Also on March 20, a fact-finding mission consisting of </p><p>representatives of four local human rights organizations </p><p>visited the man,s village, Saraswoti, in the Tokha area of </p><p>Kathmandu approximately four miles from the city center. </p><p>Villagers related that on March 15 at about 7:30 p.m. </p><p>approximately twenty army personnel arrived at the village </p><p>gate in two vehicles.  The soldiers took five men into </p><p>custody; they have not been seen since.  One was Kancha </p><p>Dangol, whose body the military attaches viewed in the </p><p>morgue.  Dangol worked as a carpenter and day laborer, and </p><p>had stood as a Nepali Congress Party candidate in a recent </p><p>ward election.  Among the other four missing men were another </p><p>carpenter, an electrician, a mechanic and a tea shop owner. </p><p>The men,s houses were "very close to each other."  (Note: </p><p>Press reports March 16 quoted a Defense Ministry press </p><p>release indicating that a man from Tokha had been killed the </p><p>previous day in a clash with security forces.) </p><p> </p><p>Press Coverage </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (S) Representatives of a consortium of human rights groups </p><p>held a press conference March 21 to release their findings, </p><p>but asked the media not to reveal the names of the </p><p>organizations or individuals involved.  Members of these </p><p>organizations expressed to Poloff a reluctance to go public </p><p>out of a fear of retribution from security forces.  Kantipur, </p><p>Nepal\'s leading vernacular daily, published a story March 22 </p><p>that related most of the groups\' findings. </p><p> </p><p>Other Victims Suspected </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (S) The head of CVICT, Bhogendra Sharma (protect), told </p><p>Poloff and visiting DRL/PHD officer Gianni Paz that his </p><p>organization had received reports of "fake encounters" - </p><p>where someone had been killed in custody but the RNA reported </p><p>the death as operational - but Dangol\'s case was the first </p><p>case for which they had solid information.  If such an </p><p>incident could happen in the capital, Sharma speculated, then </p><p>it could happen anywhere in the country.  Sharma took pains </p><p>to explain that his organization has had good connections </p><p>with the army, and that he understood that the army was </p><p>engaged in a war.  At the same time, he continued, a system </p><p>of accountability was needed; the army must investigate </p><p>reports of "fake encounters"; and authorities should not </p><p>"protect" soldiers who commit atrocities, but rather punish </p><p>them in a manner that would set an example to others.  As it </p><p>was, the RNA was "turning a blind eye," Sharma judged. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) The National People\'s Front (NPF), a minority </p><p>extreme-leftist party with five seats in Parliament, filed a </p><p>complaint with Nepal\'s human rights commission alleging that </p><p>the army had killed three of their cadres in Baglung.  The </p><p>three were arrested along with seven others.  NPF leaders </p><p>claim that, ironically, the three had previously been </p><p>threatened by the Maoists. </p><p> </p><p>Note on CVICT </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) CVICT is a non-partisan NGO that works with victims of </p><p>torture and their families.  To preserve its impartiality, </p><p>CVICT does not issue press releases or otherwise publish </p><p>information about its clients.  It has aided victims of both </p><p>Maoist and state abuse.  CVICT is one of two organizations </p><p>Post relies on most in preparing the Nepal section of the </p><p>annual Human Rights Report.  The second organization is the </p><p>Informal Sector Services Center (INSEC).  The head of CVICT </p><p>has given testimony to the Senate Foreign Relations </p><p>committee.  CVICT has received financial and materiel support </p><p>from both the Department of State and USAID. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (S) The British Assistant Military Attache concluded from </p><p>his examination that Dangol was killed by a bullet to the </p><p>head after sustaining a beating with a blunt object.  That </p><p>the RNA reported Dangol\'s death to the press - before the </p><p>body was examined by the CVICT doctor - and that the RNA </p><p>later asserted that Dangol had been killed while trying to </p><p>flee indicates that he was in their custody before he died. </p><p>How much the RNA\'s top brass knows about this - and similar </p><p>instances that have been reported to us anecdotally - remains </p><p>unclear. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
