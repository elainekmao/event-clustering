<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 001806 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/06/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MUGABE TURNS UP HEAT ON OPPOSITION </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political section chief Matt Harrington.  Reasons: 1.5 ( </p><p>B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) The Zimbabwean government has stepped up its </p><p>harassment of the MDC leadership, arresting the national </p><p>treasurer in the hospital as he recuperated from major eye </p><p>surgery, and raiding Morgan Tsvangirai\'s home in an alleged </p><p>search for arms of war and subversive materials.  In </p><p>addition, the Home Affairs Minister has threatened to </p><p>confiscate the passports of opposition party members and </p><p>other Zimbabweans he accused of lobbying for the </p><p>international imposition of sanctions on Zimbabwe.  It is </p><p>clear from these recent developments that the country\'s </p><p>continuing political crisis and consequent economic implosion </p><p>are driving ZANU-PF further into a corner, leading the ruling </p><p>party to intensify its internal repression and to lash out at </p><p>perceived enemies.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Dulini-Ncube Arrested </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (c) On August 3,  MDC national treasurer and Member of </p><p>Parliament Fletcher Dulini- Ncube was arrested in connection </p><p>with the 2001 murder of war veteran Cain Nkala, the latest </p><p>chapter of an unfortunate saga. High Court Judge Justice </p><p>George Chiweshe ruled on August 1 that the State had </p><p>presented sufficient evidence against Dulini-Ncube to warrant </p><p>his indictment, and effectively reversed an earlier High </p><p>Court decision to grant bail.  Plainclothes police officers </p><p>wasted little time in arresting Dulini-Ncube at a Bulawayo </p><p>hospital where he was recovering from major surgery -- the </p><p>removal of one of his eyes. The MDC treasurer was kept in a </p><p>police cell for six hours before his lawyer was able to </p><p>convince the authorities that he required urgent medical </p><p>attention.  Dulini-Ncube was then allowed to return to the </p><p>hospital, where he remains, but police have  posted 24- hour </p><p>guards in his hospital room. Dulini-Ncube is set to appear in </p><p>the Bulawayo Magistrate,s Court on August 6 to be formally </p><p>indicted. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Dulini-Ncube, who is a diabetic in very poor health, </p><p>spent several weeks in detention in November 2001, shortly </p><p>after the murder.  He was denied access to adequate medical </p><p>care and his strict diet, which damaged his eyesight.  After </p><p>significant pressure was brought to bear, including by AF </p><p>Assistant Secretary Secretary Kansteiner in a December 2001 </p><p>meeting with Speaker of Parliament and ZANU-PF Secretary for </p><p>Administration Emmerson Mnangagwa, Dulini-Ncube was released </p><p>on bail.  Since that time, he has dutifully complied with his </p><p>bail conditions, including reporting twice a week to the </p><p>police station, so Judge Chiweshe\'s August 1 ruling was </p><p>suprising.  Josphat Tsuma, Dulini-Ncube\'s lawyer, told poloff </p><p>on August 5 that the police had insisted it was necessary to </p><p>keep Dulini-Ncube in custody this time, despite the fact that </p><p>he was in a great deal of pain and needed constant medical </p><p>monitoring, so that he could be escorted to court for the </p><p>formal indictment.  The trial has been set for November 11, </p><p>and some senior MDC officials have confided to us that they </p><p>doubt whether Dulini-Ncube can survive another three months </p><p>in prison. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Comment: Considering that Dulini-Ncube has complied </p><p>with his bail conditions for more than nine months and could </p><p>in no way be considered a flight risk, the police action </p><p>appears heavy handed and purely intimidatory.  It is widely </p><p>believed that the Nkala murder was committed by rival ZANU-PF </p><p>supporters and war veterans, and that the government has </p><p>sought to frame the MDC.  As far as we are aware, the only </p><p>evidence against Dulini-Ncube and the two other defendants </p><p>(who are MDC activists) is a confession by the two supposed </p><p>murderers, who later recanted, saying their confessions had </p><p>been extracted under police torture.  Nkala\'s widow witnessed </p><p>his abduction but has not been permitted to recount in public </p><p>her version of events nor to identify those responsible.  It </p><p>is clear that ZANU-PF is not interested in bringing to </p><p>justice the real perpetrators, but rather in using the murder </p><p>as a convenient opportunity to increase its pressure on a key </p><p>MDC leader (one of only a handful who know the details of the </p><p>party\'s funding sources), seriously damaging his health and </p><p>draining the financially-strapped party of yet more legal </p><p>fees. </p><p> </p><p>Tsvangirai\'s house searched </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) On Sunday, August 4 -- the day after Dulini-Ncube\'s </p><p>detention -- heavily-armed police, some in riot gear, </p><p>searched the home of MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai.  They </p><p>first produced a warrant authorizing a search for arms of </p><p>war, subversive materials, and illegal immigrants.  Not </p><p>surprisingly, they found none of the above, but took away </p><p>several documents Tsvangirai described as "news items," and </p><p>confiscated the pickup truck used by his special advisor, </p><p>Gandi Mudzingwa.  Tsvangirai criticized the search as </p><p>"desperation of the worst kind,"  and asked "who in his right </p><p>senses would keep arms of war, subversive materials or </p><p>so-called illegal immigrants in his home?"  Mudzingwa </p><p>surmised to us that the search might presage an </p><p>intensification of harassment against the MDC leadership, and </p><p>said the party needed to brace itself. </p><p> </p><p>Passports to be Seized </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) When the Politburo\'s wheelchair-bound deputy </p><p>secretary for the handicapped, Joshua Malinga, was barred </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>entry to the United Kingdom in late July because of the EU </p><p>travel ban, ZANU-PF\'s propaganda machinery kicked into high </p><p>gear.  Information Minister Jonathan Moyo accused the British </p><p>government of "going bananas" and harassing disabled people </p><p>who required assistance, and he warned that perhaps it was </p><p>time for the GOZ to draw up its own list of foreign visitors </p><p>to be denied entry to Zimbabwe (a position that Foreign </p><p>Minister Mudenge and other officials have since repudiated). </p><p>In more worrisome remarks apparently aimed at the MDC, </p><p>Minister for Home Affairs John Nkomo said the GOZ was </p><p>contemplating revoking the passports of those Zimbabweans who </p><p>had allegedly campaigned abroad for the imposition of </p><p>sanctions against Zimbabwe.  Having a Zimbabwean passport is </p><p>not a right but a privilege, Nkomo insisted.  Mudzingwa told </p><p>us that his party\'s leadership had interpreted Nkomo\'s </p><p>comments as a sign that the passports of key leaders would be </p><p>confiscated imminently.  He noted that the passports of </p><p>Tsvangirai,  Secretary-General Welshman Ncube, and shadow </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>agriculture minister Renson Gasela had already been seized </p><p>pending their trial on (contrived) treason charges in </p><p>November.  The likely next targets are Vice-President Gibson </p><p>Sibanda and Deputy Secretary-General Gift Chimanikire. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) The Mugabe government\'s gut reaction to Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>continuing political crisis and its disastrous economic </p><p>effects is not to seek a reconciliation that mitigates the </p><p>damage to their country, but to lash out at those they hold </p><p>responsible for their predicament.  Mugabe and his inner </p><p>circle continue to consider the MDC a major threat to </p><p>ZANU-PF\'s 22-year hold on power, and are gradually tightening </p><p>the noose around the necks of the MDC\'s leaders.  Suspension </p><p>of travel documents is likely only the latest move in the </p><p>GOZ\'s efforts to emasculate the party that has dared to </p><p>challenge Mugabe\'s perceived right to rule Zimbabwe as long </p><p>as he chooses. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>WHITEHEAD </p><p></p></div>
