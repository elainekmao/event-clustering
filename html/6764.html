<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABU DHABI 001439 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR IRAQ TASK FORCE, ALSO NEA/ARP, NEA/EX, </p><p>NEA/IPA, AND IO/UNP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL 03/25/108 </p><p>TAGS: EAID, PREL, PGOV, PHUM, KPAL, KWBG, TC </p><p>SUBJECT:  TFIZ01: UAE POISED TO PROVIDE HUMANITARIAN </p><p>ASSISTANCE TO IRAQI PEOPLE </p><p> </p><p>REF: DUBAI 1165 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) Classified by DCM Richard A. Albright, for </p><p>reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Summary and comment:  Under the aegis of the </p><p>government-run Red Crescent Authority (RCA), the UAE is </p><p>gearing up to provide significant humanitarian </p><p>assistance to the Iraqi people.  In addition to direct </p><p>contributions from the UAEG, the Emirati public will be </p><p>mobilized through a series of telethons, food drives at </p><p>schools and businesses, and other activities that will </p><p>emphasize popular participation.  The UAEG carried out </p><p>similar humanitarian assistance programs for the </p><p>Palestinians last year, directly channeling public </p><p>frustration with events into positive activity.  While </p><p>the UAE has a strong preference to work its </p><p>humanitarian assistance directly (vice via multilateral </p><p>organizations or programs), we will work closely with </p><p>the RCA to track its activities and assist/deconflict </p><p>as necessary and appropriate.  End summary and comment. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>Red Crescent Authority Spearheads Relief Effort </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs and </p><p>UAE Red Crescent Authority (RCA) Chairman Shaykh Hamdan </p><p>Bin Zayid Al-Nahyan told the Ambassador on March 23 </p><p>that the Abu Dhabi-headquartered RCA, with branches </p><p>throughout the UAE, would be responsible for the bulk </p><p>of UAE humanitarian assistance to Iraq, and would begin </p><p>distribution of food and supplies as soon as the </p><p>security situation allows aid workers to enter safely. </p><p>He agreed that the UAEG, at some point, would probably </p><p>need to coordinate with the U.S. military to move </p><p>humanitarian supplies and personnel into Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Shaykh Hamdan noted that the RCA would </p><p>immediately purchase about $3 million USD in medical </p><p>supplies and other necessities on the local Iraqi </p><p>market, to ensure prompt distribution to the needy. </p><p>RCA already has provided more than $25,000 USD in </p><p>supplies to hospitals and orphanages in Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) According to press reports, the RCA has </p><p>established 115 posts throughout the UAE where </p><p>donations in cash and supplies can be received.  RCA </p><p>Manager of Relief and Projects Dr. Salih Al-Taie said </p><p>the organization expects to provide tons of high- </p><p>calorie food items, including milk powder and biscuits </p><p>for children, and supplies such as tents and blankets </p><p>to the people of Iraq.  Al-Taie said that the apparent </p><p>shortage of drinking water in the city of Basra </p><p>prompted RCA officials to purchase water filtering </p><p>equipment and electricity generators, in addition to </p><p>pharmaceutical products. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) An RCA delegation left Monday for Amman, Jordan </p><p>to assess the humanitarian situation of refugees there, </p><p>according to press reports.  RCA officials are </p><p>organizing similar assessment visits to neighboring </p><p>countries that expect to receive an influx of Iraqi </p><p>civilians fleeing the war. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>World Food Program Opens Its Doors In Dubai </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) The UAE Foreign Ministry yesterday signed an </p><p>agreement with the United Nations World Food Program </p><p>(WFP) formalizing WFP\'s regional office in Dubai. </p><p>Shaykh Hamdan said that the WFP\'s regional office in </p><p>Dubai would service the Iraqi people, and begin </p><p>operations this week.  (Note:  This is apparently for </p><p>reasons of political cover.  WFP has had a regional </p><p>office in Dubai for some time, and its operations are </p><p>not specifically related to the Iraq crisis, although </p><p>it will in fact support them.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>Dubai Starts Its Own Iraq Relief Campaign </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) The Shaykh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al-Maktoum </p><p>Charity and Humanitarian Foundation (whose patron is </p><p>the UAE Defense Minister and Dubai Crown Prince) </p><p>launched today a 12-hour telethon in support of the </p><p>Iraqi people on Dubai Television.  The slogan of the </p><p>telethon is "The Campaign For Our Brethren In Iraq." </p><p>The Foundation is an umbrella organization of 16 </p><p>charities in the UAE, and has launched a month-long </p><p>campaign to raise funds and supplies for the Iraqi </p><p>people.  On 23 March, Shaykh Mohammed offered the </p><p>Foundation\'s assistance distributing food aid to Iraqis </p><p>(which he feels would be more acceptable to Iraqis than </p><p>direct USG assistance)(reftel). </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) According to press reporting, Dubai Attorney </p><p>General and Vice-Chairman of the MBR Foundation Ibrahim </p><p>Bu Melha confirmed that the Foundation had opened two </p><p>bank accounts to receive donations, as well as </p><p>collection centers where donors can drop relief goods. </p><p>The Foundation is ready to send teams to Iraq to </p><p>supervise the distribution of goods. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U) Bu Melha said that coordination with </p><p>international organizations in Iraq began before the </p><p>war.  The Foundation stored 500 tons of dates and other </p><p>foodstuff in mosques around Baghdad a month ago. </p><p>Foundation officials had hoped that Coalition forces </p><p>would not destroy mosques. Prior to the onset of </p><p>hostilities, the Foundation made arrangements with </p><p>relief agencies in Iraq to begin distributing some of </p><p>these items -- more than 300 tons of dates have already </p><p>been distributed, he told the press. </p><p> </p><p>11. (U) In the northern emirate of Ajman, a 3-day </p><p>fundraiser for Iraqi children started today as part of </p><p>the "Funtasia 2003" festival.  However, a children\'s </p><p>festival in the emirate of Ras Al Khaimah was </p><p>cancelled today to express solidarity for the </p><p>suffering of the Iraqi people. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
