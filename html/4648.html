<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 007151 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR DS/DSS, DS/IP/FPO, DS/OP/NEA, AND NEA/ARN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/08/2007 </p><p>TAGS: ASEC, ABUD, AFIN, AMGT </p><p>SUBJECT: REQUEST FOR SECURITY ENHANCEMENTS - AMMAN </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) AMMAN 7077 B) AMMAN 6393 C) AMMAN 6912 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: TODD BROWN, REGIONAL SECURITY OFFICER, REASONS 1.5 (G) </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED - PROTECT ACCORDINGLY </p><p> </p><p>1. (U)  THIS IS AN ACTION REQUEST </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) IN RESPONSE TO THE OCTOBER 28, 2002 ASSASSINATION OF </p><p>U.S. DIPLOMAT LARRY FOLEY IN AMMAN, THE REGIONAL SECURITY </p><p>OFFICE, WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF TDY SUPPORT FROM THE </p><p>DEPARTMENT, HAS COMPLETED REVIEWS OF EMBASSY AMMAN\'S SECURITY </p><p>PROGRAMS.  THESE REVIEWS PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON THE LOCAL GUARD </p><p>FORCE, SURVEILLANCE DETECTION UNIT AND RESIDENTIAL SECURITY </p><p>PROGRAMS AND HOW THEY COULD BE ENHANCED TO PROVIDE A GREATER </p><p>LEVEL OF PROTECTION FOR PERSONNEL AND FACILITIES.  IN A </p><p>DECEMBER 8 EMERGENCY ACTION COMMITTE MEETING CHAIRED BY THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR, EAC MEMBERS ENDORSED THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE </p><p>REGIONAL SECURITY OFFICER.  IN THE VIEW OF THE EAC, </p><p>AUTHORIZED DEPARTURE HAS HAD A BENEFICIAL EFFECT IN OFFERING </p><p>OPTIONS FOR INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES, BUT THE SECURITY </p><p>SITUATION CONTINUES TO REQUIRE CONSTANT CAREFUL MONITORING </p><p>AND EFFECTIVE ACTION. THE FOLLOWING IS A LIST OF SECURITY </p><p>UPGRADES THAT POST FEELS ARE STRONGLY WARRANTED IN RESPONSE </p><p>NOT ONLY TO THE FOLEY ASSASSINATION BUT THE OVERALL THREAT </p><p>ENVIRONMENT. </p><p> </p><p>- - - - - - - - - </p><p>LOCAL GUARD FORCE </p><p>- - - - - - - - - </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) POST CURRENTLY RELIES ON (4) RESIDENTIAL MOBILE </p><p>PATROLS COVERING APPROXIMATELY 70 SEPARATE RESIDENTIAL </p><p>FACILITIES IN FOUR RESIDENTIAL SECTORS.  THESE PATROLS, </p><p>UTILIZING A GEMS SYSTEM, MAKE SIX SECURITY CHECKS PER 24-HOUR </p><p>PERIOD.  POST REQUESTS IMMEDIATE APPROVAL TO ADD AN </p><p>ADDITIONAL (4) MOBILE UNITS TO ALLOW FOR TWELVE SECURITY </p><p>CHECKS PER 24-HOUR PERIOD.  THE ADDITIONAL UNITS WOULD NOT </p><p>ONLY ALLOW FOR MORE FREQUENT STOPS AND HIGHER VISIBILITY, BUT </p><p>SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE RESPONSE TIME IN THE EVENT OF AN </p><p>INCIDENT. THE CONTRACT MODIFICATION WOULD REQUIRE THE FOUR </p><p>VEHICLES, VEHICLE OPERATION COSTS, FOUR DRIVER POSITIONS, </p><p>FOUR SENIOR GUARD POSITIONS, AND THE POSITION UPGRADE OF A </p><p>MOBILE PATROL SUPERVISOR TO MOBILE COMMANDER.  THE COST AS </p><p>PROVIDED BY THE LOCAL GUARD CONTRACTOR IS $71,000 FOR </p><p>VEHICLES (NON-RECURRING), $12,500 VEHICLE OPERATION </p><p>(RECURRING), $78,000 FOR (4) DRIVER POSITIONS, $82,00 FOR (4) </p><p>SENIOR GUARD POSITIONS (RECURRING) AND $200 FOR THE POSITION </p><p>UPGRADE. IN ADDITION TO THE MOBILE PATROLS, POST CURRENTLY </p><p>HAS ONE MOBILE SUPERVISORY PATROL, AND ONE MOBILE PATROL </p><p>ASSIGNED TO COVER ANCILLARY FACILITIES.  THERE IS NO NEED FOR </p><p>AN INCREASE TO THESE AREAS. </p><p> </p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - </p><p>RESIDENTIAL SECURITY </p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) POST HAD ALREADY RECEIVED THE DEPARTMENT\'S APPROVAL </p><p>FOR REPLACING ANTIQUATED ALARM UNITS IN RESIDENCES.  THIS WAS </p><p>ORIGINALLY APPROVED AS A INCREMENTAL PROCESS OVER A PERIOD OF </p><p>YEARS.  HOWEVER, THE CURRENT SECURITY ENVIRONMENT MANDATES </p><p>THIS PROCESS BE EXPEDITED AND COMPLETED IMMEDIATELY.  IT ALSO </p><p>CALLS FOR A SYSTEM (PREFERABLY AES 5100) COMPATIBLE WITH THE </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION OF A CENTRAL ALARM MONITORING SYSTEM (CAMS). </p><p>A CAMS WOULD ALLOW EVEN QUICKER RESPONSE AND TREAT THE MOBILE </p><p>UNIT MORE AS A REACT VEHICLE.  POST CURRENTLY HAS AN </p><p>INVENTORY OF 25 NEW AES 5100\'S WHICH ARE IN THE PROCESS OF </p><p>BEING INSTALLED.  AN ADDITIONAL 85 UNITS WOULD BE REQUIRED. </p><p>THE COST OF THE ADDITIONAL 85 UNITS IS $86,000.  POST HAS </p><p>INSTALLED A FEW LOCALLY PROCURED UNITS THAT ARE COMPATIBLE </p><p>WITH THE AES 3015 CAMS RECEIVER. THE AES 3015 CAMS RECEIVER </p><p>COSTS $5000 AND A COMPUTER TO MANAGE THE PROGRAM MAY ALSO BE </p><p>REQUIRED.  AES HAS NOT AS YET PROVIDED THE COST FOR THE </p><p>COMPUTER. WHILE WE WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO HAVE THIS IN-PLACE </p><p>AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, WE CURRENTLY RELY ON A LOCAL ALARM </p><p>CONTRACTOR FOR INSTALLATION AND MAINTENANCE AND FEAR THIS </p><p>PROCESS WOULD TAKE SIGNIFICANT TIME BEFORE COMPLETION.  OUR </p><p>CURRENT ALARM INSTALLER CHARGES $260 PER UNIT, AT 85 UNITS </p><p>POST WOULD REQUIRE $23,000 FOR INSTALLATION. IT APPEARS OUR </p><p>LOCAL OPTIONS MAY BE SOMEWHAT LIMITED BUT WE ARE WILLING TO </p><p>EXPLORE POSSIBILITIES THROUGH A SOLICITATION PROCESS.  ARE </p><p>THERE OTHER OPTIONS AVAILABLE THAT MIGHT ALLOW THE CAMS TO BE </p><p>OPERATIONAL SOONER, SUCH AS AN AES TEAM (OR DS TEAM) COMING </p><p>OUT TO POST TO DO SOME OR ALL OF THE INSTALLATIONS?  IT MAY </p><p>ALSO BE NECESSARY TO HAVE AES PROVIDE SOME TRAINING AND/OR </p><p>TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ONCE THE SYSTEM IS READY FOR OPERATION. </p><p>THESE COSTS CAN BE PROVIDED ONCE WE RECEIVE THEM FROM AES. </p><p>ADDITIONALLY, THE LOCAL GUARD CONTRACT WOULD REQUIRE A </p><p>MODIFICATION TO ALLOW FOR A 24-HOUR DISPATCH POSITION TO </p><p>ADMINISTER THE SYSTEM.  COST OF THE DISPATCHER POSITION IS </p><p>$19,500. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) POST HAS IDENTIFIED THREE APARTMENT BUILDINGS WITH </p><p>MULTIPLE EMBASSY LEASES THAT ARE IN NEED OF A VEHICLE BARRIER </p><p>TO CONTROL THE OFF-STREET PARKING AREA INSIDE THE COMPLEX (IN </p><p>ONE CASE UNDERGROUND).  POST HAS APPROACHED LANDLORDS </p><p>REGARDING THIS VULNERABILITY BUT IN EACH CASE THE LANDLORD/S </p><p>HAVE BEEN UNRECEPTIVE TO PROVIDE THE UPGRADE.  POST </p><p>UNDERSTANDS SOME OF THE INHERENT PROBLEMS WITH PROVIDING </p><p>AUTOMATIC GATE CONTROLS AT BUILDINGS NOT ENTIRELY EMBASSY </p><p>OCCUPIED BUT FEEL WE CAN WORK THROUGH ANY </p><p>PROCEDURAL/MAINTENANCE ISSUES THAT MAY ARISE. POST THEREFORE </p><p>REQUESTS FUNDING IN THE AMOUNT OF $5000 FOR (3) ELECTRONIC </p><p>ROLL-DOWN OR SLIDE GATES. </p><p> </p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - </p><p>SURVEILLANCE DETECTION UNITS </p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) POST HAS A WELL-TRAINED AND EFFECTIVE SURVEILLANCE </p><p>DETECTION UNIT (SDU).  HOWEVER, AN INCREASE IN THE UNIT SIZE </p><p>WOULD ALLOW FOR GREATER COVERAGE OF COMMONLY TRAVELED </p><p>EMPLOYEE ROUTES AND MORE ROUTINE COVERAGE OF CHOKE POINTS. </p><p>WHILE RESIDENCES MAY NOT BE A DEFINED CATEGORY OF SDU </p><p>COVERAGE, THE INCREASE WOULD ALLOW FOR SOME FLEXIBILITY IN </p><p>PROVIDING A LEVEL OF SUPPORT TO RESIDENCES AS DEEMED </p><p>APPROPRIATE.  POST THEREFORE REQUESTS IMMEDIATE APPROVAL FOR </p><p>AN ADDITIONAL SIX SDU POSITIONS, THE UPGRADE OF AN EXISTING </p><p>POSITION TO A SUPERVISORY GRADE, AND AN ADDITIONAL VEHICLE TO </p><p>ASSIST IN SUPPORTING THE INCREASE.  TOTAL COST OF THE SIX </p><p>ADDITIONAL SDU POSITIONS IS $81,000, VEHICLE COST IS $5000, </p><p>AND THE POSITION UPGRADE IS $1500. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SDU) POST APPRECIATES THE EXCELLENT SUPPORT RECEIVED FROM </p><p>THE DEPARTMENT IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE FOLEY ASSASSINATION. </p><p>WE FEEL THE ABOVE ENHANCEMENTS ARE RESPONSIBLE UPGRADES AND </p><p>WILL GREATLY ASSIST IN OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE INCREASED </p><p>SECURITY FOR OUR PERSONNEL.  WE HAVE LIKEWISE FACTORED IN OUR </p><p>HOUSING PROFILE AND IMPLEMENTED A HOUSING STRATEGY THAT </p><p>ALLOWS US TO CONSOLIDATE SECURITY RESOURCES BY IDENTIFYING </p><p>RESIDENCES/APARTMENTS NEARER THE EMBASSY AND ONE ANOTHER.  WE </p><p>ALSO NOTE THAT WE ARE NEARING THE FINAL OPTION YEAR OF OUR </p><p>COMMERCIAL GUARD CONTRACT. </p><p>BERRY </p><p></p></div>
