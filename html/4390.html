<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 TEGUCIGALPA 003145 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT. FOR WHA, WHA/CCA, AND WHA/CEN </p><p>STATE FOR INR, S/CT, DS/ICI/ITA, AND PRM </p><p>STATE PASS AID FOR LAC/CEN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/19/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, EAID, PGOV, ETTC, PINR, SMIG, ASEC, HO, CU </p><p>SUBJECT: (S) HONDURAS HAS MANY CUBAN DOCTORS; MADURO </p><p>CONCERNED OVER INTELLIGENCE WORK BUT NO GOH PLANS TO </p><p>CURTAIL GOC ASSISTANCE </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. PIERCE/FISK E-MAIL NOVEMBER </p><p>     B. TEGUCIGALPA 3076 </p><p>     C. STATE 205386 (ALL NOTAL) </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Deputy Chief of Mission Roger Pierce; </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (S) Summary:  There are approximately 100-225 Cuban </p><p>doctors and nurses in Honduras.  A bilateral treaty between </p><p>the GOH and the GOC governs the program.  In addition, there </p><p>are approximately 500 Hondurans studying medicine in Cuba on </p><p>GOC scholarships.  President Ricardo Maduro told Ambassador </p><p>November 12 that he was very concerned with the intelligence </p><p>activities of the Cuban Medical Brigade, and that he was not </p><p>aware of any immediate plans to accept the Cuban nomination </p><p>of Dr. Elis Alberto Gonzalez Polanco, Chief of the Cuban </p><p>Medical Brigade, as the first Cuban Ambassador to Honduras. </p><p>Nevertheless, the GOH is not likely to curtail any of its </p><p>medical assistance programs with Cuba.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Cuban Doctors and Nurses in Honduras </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) PolOff delivered reftel C demarche on Cuban doctors </p><p>November 5 to MFA DG for Foreign Policy AMB Mario Fortin. </p><p>PolOff emphasized talking points about the disadvantages of </p><p>accepting Cuban doctors.  PolOff also gave Fortin detailed </p><p>information on USAID and Peace Corps health projects in </p><p>Honduras, which are substantial. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU)  Fortin told PolOff that the GOH had a bilateral </p><p>treaty with the GOC governing the Cuban Medical Brigades </p><p>program in Honduras.  Note:  USAID has asked the Ministry of </p><p>Health for a copy of the treaty, which Post will fax to </p><p>WHA/CEN and WHA/CCA if a copy is obtained.  End Note.  Fortin </p><p>said that the GOH sets the total numbers of doctors the </p><p>Cubans can bring to Honduras and decides where the doctors </p><p>go.  Typically the Cuban doctors are sent to rural areas or </p><p>other hard-to-staff areas where Honduran doctors do not want </p><p>to go.  Note: PolOff and ConOff briefly met a Cuban doctor at </p><p>the National Mental Hospital during a joint CONS/POL tour of </p><p>the facility.  End Note. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Fortin estimated there are approximately 100 Cuban </p><p>doctors in Honduras.  USAID estimates that there are </p><p>approximately 227 Cuban doctors and nurses in Honduras at any </p><p>given time, and that approximately one-third of the Cubans </p><p>are women.  Fortin said that the Cuban doctors must return to </p><p>Cuba when their six-month stay was complete.  He said there </p><p>had not been any requests for political asylum or any other </p><p>problems.  USAID has learned that 20 of the Cuban </p><p>doctors/nurses have asked to stay in Honduras.  Fortin said </p><p>that the GOH does not pay the doctors salaries, but does pay </p><p>a small amount (approximately USD 75/doctor) via PAHO to the </p><p>doctors. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Fortin claimed that the GOC had not used the </p><p>assistance by the doctors to try to get GOH support for Cuba </p><p>in multilateral fora. </p><p> </p><p>6. (S) President Ricardo Maduro told Ambassador November 12 </p><p>that he was very concerned with the intelligence activities </p><p>of the Cuban Medical Brigade in Honduras, saying that he was </p><p>convinced they were up to mischief (ref A).  In addition, </p><p>Maduro said that he was not aware of any immediate plans to </p><p>accept the Cuban nomination of Dr. Elis Alberto Gonzalez </p><p>Polanco, Chief of the Cuban Medical Brigade, as the first </p><p>Cuban Ambassador to Honduras since the GOH normalized </p><p>diplomatic relations with Cuba January 26, 2002 (see ref B </p><p>for more information on that issue).  Maduro reiterated that </p><p>he was in no hurry to act on this issue and promised </p><p>Ambassador that he would consult with the Embassy prior to </p><p>any announcement of the acceptance of a Cuban ambassador. </p><p>Maduro said that he would look very closely at the proposed </p><p>candidate\'s background to assure that it was not problematic </p><p>in terms of unacceptable activities, including human rights </p><p>violations. </p><p> </p><p>Honduran Med Students in Cuba; Cuban Professors in Honduras </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) In addition, Fortin said there are approximately 500 </p><p>Hondurans currently studying medicine in Cuba on GOC </p><p>scholarships, with 100 starting each year.  Fortin said that </p><p>several private universities also have agreements directly </p><p>with the GOC to bring Cuban professors to Honduras to teach. </p><p>He said that the professors are paid approximately USD </p><p>200/month directly, not via the GOC, for a period of six </p><p>months to one year.  He said there had not been any problems </p><p>or requests for political asylum from the professors.  Post </p><p>also notes that Minister of Public Health Elias Lizardo has </p><p>traveled to Cuba a couple times in 2002 and that some </p><p>Hondurans travel to Cuba for medical treatment. </p><p> </p><p>GTMO Cubans and Rafters </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) Fortin said that the lack of problems with the Cuban </p><p>doctors and professors was in contrast to the Cubans who came </p><p>to Honduras from Guantanamo.  Of the twelve families, Fortin </p><p>said that most had left Honduras, with the majority of those </p><p>going to Mexico or the U.S. illegally.  He termed the program </p><p>a complete failure.  In an unrelated meeting with </p><p>International Organization of Migration (IOM) official </p><p>Norberto Giron November 13, Giron told PolOff that to the </p><p>best of IOM\'s knowledge all of the Cubans resettled from </p><p>Guantanamo had left Honduras illegally for either Mexico or </p><p>the U.S.  Fortin also told PolOff that in the past a small </p><p>number of rafters have arrived on the Caribbean coast of </p><p>Honduras and have been granted political asylum. </p><p> </p><p>Honduras Willing to Accept Cuban Doctors Despite Negatives </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (S) Comment:  It is apparent to Post that the GOH is not </p><p>likely to curtail any of its medical assistance programs with </p><p>Cuba.  As a poor, developing country with a limited public </p><p>health system, the GOH is unlikely to turn down any offers of </p><p>assistance, even when aspects of the program concern the </p><p>president himself.  Post is pleased to note President </p><p>Maduro\'s hesitancy in moving forward on the Cubans\' </p><p>nomination of Polanco for ambassador.  Post expects that </p><p>Maduro will stick to his promise to Ambassador to consult </p><p>with the Embassy before making any announcement on a Cuban </p><p>ambassador.  Post is hopeful that Maduro will either continue </p><p>to delay a decision or reject Polanco\'s nomination outright. </p><p>End Comment. </p><p>PALMER </p><p></p></div>
