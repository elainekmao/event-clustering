<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 SANAA 001190 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/26/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, KCRM, PGOV, PREL, SNAR, IR, YE </p><p>SUBJECT: IRAN\'S PRESIDENT KHATAMI VISITS YEMEN: NO </p><p>NOTICEABLE EXCITEMENT </p><p> </p><p>REF: SANAA 1188 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM ALAN MISENHEIMER FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (E) </p><p> </p><p>------ </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. C) Iranian President Mohammed Khatami\'s May 15/18 visit to </p><p>Yemen was low-key, almost pro forma, with little public </p><p>exposure and no overtures to Yemen\'s large Shi\'a community. </p><p>Although six cooperative agreements were signed, in areas </p><p>from security to shipping, the accords broke little new </p><p>ground. The joint statement released on his departure was </p><p>anodyne, calling for "foreign troops to end their occupation </p><p>of Iraq."  Relations have improved in recent years and </p><p>Khatami showed a friendly face.  But the visit does not seem </p><p>to signal great advances in mutual confidence. End Summary </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>LOW-KEY FORMALITY </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  Iran\'s President Mohammed Khatami, returning ROYG </p><p>President Salih\'s 2002 visit to Tehran, was welcomed with all </p><p>presidential courtesies in Sanaa on May 15. His schedule was </p><p>formal, with few public events. All proper protocol was </p><p>observed, including joint arrival statements with television </p><p>coverage. The two presidents were photographed beaming </p><p>cordially across the interpreter; in a rare departure from </p><p>his usual formal habits, President Salih wore Yemeni native </p><p>dress, with the traditional jambiah dagger in his belt. </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>PHOTO OPS </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  Khatami\'s official meetings were appropriately </p><p>scheduled with the highest ranking local notables, including </p><p>Speaker of Parliament, Sheikh Abdullah al-Ahmar, Shura </p><p>Council head, Abdul Aziz Abdul Ghani, and Prime Minister </p><p>Abdul Qadir Ba Jammal. Katemi also had an unusual private </p><p>meeting with Ahmad Ali Abdullah Saleh, the president\'s 33 </p><p>year old son who commands the Republican Guard, but no </p><p>substantive military contacts. The opening greetings at all </p><p>these meetings were duly photographed for television and </p><p>newspapers, but the conversations were merely summarized as </p><p>"friendly exchanges of views." </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>WHAT DIDN\'T HAPPEN </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Khatami did not address any public gatherings during </p><p>his visit, such as university students or parliamentary </p><p>groups, did not meet with any local Shi\'a clerics, and gave </p><p>no interviews to the local media. He  visited Sanaa\'s famous </p><p>Grand Mosque (which dates from the seventh century founding </p><p>of Islam) but as a tourist rather than a worshiper.  Local </p><p>television covered President Salih attendance at Friday </p><p>prayers at the same mosque, escorted by his usual retainers </p><p>but without his Iranian visitors. </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>THE AGREEMENTS </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) The two sides signed agreements in six areas, </p><p>including  security, trade, development and economic </p><p>cooperation, banking, education and culture and shipping. </p><p>According to one Yemeni contact in the Ministery of </p><p>Development and International Cooperation, the two agreements </p><p>signed in his office were "fill in the blanks" documents with </p><p>few specific references to Yemeni conditions.  Press accounts </p><p>of the security accord refer to increased cooperation on </p><p>fighting drug trafficing and organized crime. (Other details </p><p>about security cooperation are reported reftel.) </p><p> </p><p>6.(C) The more specific agreements focused on trade, </p><p>education, and shipping.  Bilateral trade has grown tenfold </p><p>since 1990 and Iranian goods are increasingly found in local </p><p>markets, including machine tools, pharmaceuticals, and small </p><p>buses. (These products often beat European, Asian and </p><p>American products on price, FOB Aden, and are considered good </p><p>quality by local merchants.) Iranian companies have completed </p><p>several projects here, including the Socotra airport strip, </p><p>improvements to Hodeidah\'s oil port anchorage, and road </p><p>paving works. In education, Iran offered a number of </p><p>scholarships and exchange programs as well as a schedule for </p><p>increased "cultural functions." The shipping agreement </p><p>reflects Yemen\'s need to increase traffic through the port of </p><p>Aden; more Iranian cargo and tanker ships would be most </p><p>welcome, whether to transship goods, or merely for bunkering </p><p>stops. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>THE JOINT STATEMENT </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) The anodyne joint statement signed by Salih and </p><p>Khatemi may also have been a cut and paste exercise: there is </p><p>little to distinguish Yemen\'s document from other stops on </p><p>Khatami\'s Arab Tour 2003.  Predictably, both leaders praised </p><p>brotherly relations, called for immediate withdrawal of </p><p>foreign troops from Iraq, stressed the pivotal role of the UN </p><p>and renewed their dedication to the legitimate rights of the </p><p>Palestinian people, including Jerusalem as their capital. </p><p>They did strongly denounce and condemn terrorism, but drew a </p><p>distinction between it and "legitimate national resistance" </p><p>movements. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8.(C)  Khatami\'s recent tour focused on Arab countries with </p><p>large Shi\'a communities embedded among Sunnis.  But, in Yemen </p><p>at least, pastoral or leadership pretensions were not </p><p>apparent.  He seemed to go out of his way to be </p><p>non-threatening to his Yemeni hosts, who had viewed past </p><p>Iranian leaders with deep suspicion.  The visit had some </p><p>practical benefits: ROYG President Salih enjoys the prestige </p><p>of international visitors, growing commercial ties make </p><p>economic sense, and poor Yemeni students, especially those </p><p>majoring in religious and legal training, will gratefully </p><p>accept scholarships to Iran. However, as one MFA contact </p><p>commented, the visit did little to strengthen ties between </p><p>Yemen and Iran, because no one expects Khatami to hold power </p><p>much longer "between you Americans and the Mullahs." </p><p>HULL </p><p></p></div>
