(U) Classified by A/DCM Thomas E. Williams for reasons </p><p>1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Summary: Although it may be business-as-usual in </p><p>some parts of the Gulf (ref A), the launch of the GCC </p><p>Customs Union on January 1 is actually raising barriers to </p><p>trade in the UAE.  The emirate of Abu Dhabi, in particular, </p><p>is struggling to manage problems arising from the new </p><p>requirement, per the GCC Customs Union, to impose 5 percent </p><p>duty on previously exempt consumer goods.  The local </p><p>business community complains that certain imported goods, </p><p>formerly exempt from customs duties under UAE jurisdiction, </p><p>are now subject to 5 percent tax.  While it is hoped that </p><p>the GCC list of products exempted from duties will increase </p><p>with time, for now local importers -- and ultimately </p><p>consumers -- will pay a higher price for certain products in </p><p>the UAE.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>An U.S. Company Cries Foul... </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) An American oil services company contacted Econoff </p><p>on January 5 to complain that oil field machinery -- </p><p>previously exempt from any UAE customs tax -- is now subject </p><p>to the 5 percent GCC duty.  Deputy Director of Abu Dhabi </p><p>Customs Department Mohammed Khamis confirmed that oil field </p><p>machinery is subject to tax, but told Econoff that the </p><p>emirate\'s Customs Department is willing to review the import </p><p>of goods formerly exempted from customs duties on a case-by- </p><p>case basis. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) Khamis noted that import goods on the UAE\'s </p><p>exemption list could be exempted from the GCC customs tax if </p><p>the importing company presents its industrial license to the </p><p>customs authorities, as well as a letter from the General </p><p>Industry Corporation or the Ministry of Finance certifying </p><p>that the company is authorized to import the good.  Although </p><p>it is an untested procedure -- and specific to the emirate </p><p>of Abu Dhabi -- Econoff advised the American company that </p><p>this certification process may provide a temporary solution </p><p>to the problem. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>...And Local Officials Despair </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) The GCC Customs Union also limits the incentives the </p><p>emirate of Abu Dhabi can employ to attract foreign </p><p>investors.  During a meeting of local and foreign </p><p>businessmen on January 12, Director General of the Abu Dhabi </p><p>Chamber of Commerce and Industry Mohammed Omar Abdullah </p><p>confirmed that the emirate no longer could offer customs </p><p>exemptions as a business investment incentive.  He privately </p><p>told Econoff that Abu Dhabi relied on customs exemptions to </p><p>compete with the plethora of free zones in Dubai and the </p><p>northern emirates. (Note: Transshipped goods are not subject </p><p>to customs in the FZs.)  Nevertheless, Abu Dhabi authorities </p><p>do not plan to establish a free zone in the emirate, </p><p>according to Abdullah. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Comment: No one here doubts that the UAE will </p><p>benefit from the GCC Customs Union in the long-run, but Abu </p><p>Dhabi emirate and local businesses alike are feeling the </p><p>painful effects of the transition.  The matter is </p><p>complicated further by the fact that the newly established </p><p>UAE Customs Authority (ref B) -- the supposed central </p><p>clearinghouse for customs information and changes related to </p><p>GCC Customs Union -- is not yet up-and-running.  Although </p><p>the GCC exemptions list is sure to grow as Member States </p><p>work out the mechanics of the Customs Union, Abu Dhabi </p><p>importers are likely to factor in the increased cost of </p><p>doing business here and pass it on to consumers.  End </p><p>comment. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
