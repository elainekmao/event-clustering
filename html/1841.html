TAURAN HAD </p><p>HAD A CONCURRENT MEETING WITH ARAFAT\'S DELEGATION, </p><p>INCLUDING MEMBERS OF ARAFAT\'S NEGOTIATING TEAM.  TAURAN </p><p>UNDERSCORED THE VATICAN\'S VIEW THAT THE SITUATION IS QUITE </p><p>SERIOUS, AND THEIR VIEW THAT THE VIOLENCE HAD CROSSED AN </p><p>IMPORTANT AND WORRISOME THRESHOLD AT THE WAILING WALL </p><p>EARLIER IN THE WEEK. (NOTE: A VATICAN PRIORITY IN THE MEPP </p><p>IS PROTECTION OF THE HOLY PLACES).  TAURAN SAID THE POPE </p><p>WANTS THE PRESIDENT TO KNOW ARAFAT IS READY TO ACCEPT ANY </p><p>TYPE OF OBSERVERS IN ORDER TO BREAK THE CYCLE OF VIOLENCE. </p><p>THE POPE SPECIFICALLY ASKED THAT PRESIDENT BUSH EXERCISE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  04064  030845Z </p><p>PRESSURE ON THE GOI, IN ORDER TO PERMIT "THE MECHANISM OF </p><p>OBSERVATION TO START" AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

IN RESPONSE TO CHARGE\'S </p><p>QUESTION, TAURAN ADMITTED THAT THE VATICAN HAS NOT HAD ANY </p><p>RECENT CONTACTS WITH THE ISRAELI SIDE.  (NOTE: TAURAN </p><p>DIDN\'T EVEN REMEMBER THE ISRAELI HOLY SEE AMBASSADOR\'S NAME </p><p>-- AN INDICATION OF HOW DISTANT THE VATICAN NOW IS FROM THE </p><p>GOI).  TAURAN REMINDED US THAT HE HAD FIRST MENTIONED THE </p><p>NEED FOR AN INTERNATIONAL OBSERVER FORCE LAST NOVEMBER. </p><p>WHILE THE VATICAN SUPPORTS THE MITCHELL PLAN, TAURAN </p><p>BELIEVED THE ONLY WAY TO STOP THE VIOLENCE NOW IS WITH THE </p><p>HELP OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY (IE. AN OBSERVER </p><p>FORCE). </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  IN A SIDE NOTE, TAURAN, WHO HAD TOLD  US LAST YEAR </p><p>THAT HE THOUGHT ARAFAT WAS "LOSING IT" BOTH MENTALLY AND </p><p>PHYSICALLY, NOW OBSERVED ARAFAT TO BE MENTALLY SHARP AND </p><p>ENGAGED, WHILE PERHAPS DETERIORATING PHYSICALLY WITH </p><p>PARKINSON\'S-LIKE SYMPTOMS. </p><p> </p><p>4.
