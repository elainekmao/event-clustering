<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L THE HAGUE 001888 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/24/2013 </p><p>TAGS: KNNP, IR, NL, IAEA </p><p>SUBJECT: ACTING NP/DAS FITZPATRICK\'S MEETING WITH THE DUTCH </p><p>MFA ON IRAN </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 210913 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: CLASSIFIED BY POLITICAL COUNSELOR MARY DALY FOR REASONS </p><p>1.5 (B AND D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C)  Summary:  Acting NP/DAS Fitzpatrick and T Senior </p><p>Advisor Wurmser met with Dutch MFA Security Policy Chief </p><p>Maurits Jochems on July 21 to discuss next steps concerning </p><p>Iran and the IAEA.  The Dutch are seized with the urgency of </p><p>the Iranian nuclear issue.  They agreed to support </p><p>encouraging IAEA DG ElBaradei to issue his full report on </p><p>August 15.  The Dutch also agreed to raise the need for Iran </p><p>to abandon its efforts to acquire a full fuel cycle with </p><p>other EU Members before the September IAEA Board of Governors </p><p>meeting, and to forestall support for only accepting an </p><p>Iranian commitment to transparency and signing of an </p><p>Additional Protocol.  The Dutch will approach NAM Board </p><p>Members on their own to address the seriousness of the Iran </p><p>nuclear issue.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Acting DAS for Nonproliferation Mark Fitzpatrick and T </p><p>Senior Advisor David Wurmser reviewed the Iranian nuclear </p><p>issue with MFA Security Policy Chief Maurits Jochems and MFA </p><p>Nonproliferation Director Paul Wilke on July 21.  The Dutch </p><p>share the U.S. sense of urgency about the Iranian nuclear </p><p>program.  Jochems said the Dutch would support encouraging </p><p>IAEA Director General ElBaradei to issue his full report on </p><p>Iran on August 15 rather than at the end of the month. </p><p>Jochems said the Dutch also supported delaying the EU\'s Trade </p><p>Cooperation Agreement (TCA) with Iran until nonproliferation </p><p>concerns have been resolved.  On tactics in the IAEA, he said </p><p>the Dutch thought the Iranians should be presented with an </p><p>clear demand to accede to an Additional Protocol by September. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  Wilke said that work needed to be done discussing an </p><p>"acceptable end state" because many were arguing that Iranian </p><p>commitment to an Additional Protocol would be enough.  The </p><p>Dutch consider this a first step.  Acting DAS Fitzpatrick </p><p>said the U.S. would appreciate the Netherlands\' floating the </p><p>idea that Iran needed to commit to abandoning its full fuel </p><p>cycle program within the EU.  Jochems agreed that the </p><p>Netherlands would pursue this with EU partners before the </p><p>September BOG meeting.  Wilke urged the U.S. to help the </p><p>Netherlands make the case by providing "hard facts to good </p><p>partners" in the form of additional intelligence on the </p><p>Iranian program. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Fitzpatrick noted U.S. efforts to discuss the Iranian </p><p>nuclear issue with India and also NAM countries in Latin </p><p>America and encouraged the Dutch to do so as well.  Jochems </p><p>said the Dutch would instruct their missions in NAM capitals </p><p>to raise the issue. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) Acting DAS Fitzpatrick has cleared this cable. </p><p>RUSSEL </p><p></p></div>
