<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 001135 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O.12958: DECL: 4/5/12 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, ECON, EFIN, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: ABUJA ROUND-UP March 25-April 5 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER. REASON 1.5 </p><p>(B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>BATTLE OF THE BULGING BUDGET </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) On March 26, the National Assembly approved </p><p>the 2002 budget of N1.06 trillion (USD 8.7 billion), a </p><p>20 percent increase over the President\'s N841 billion </p><p>(USD 7.25 billion) proposal. In a radio call-in </p><p>program later that week, President Obasanjo signaled </p><p>his intention to veto the measure because it would </p><p>necessitate significant deficit spending.  Instead, he </p><p>promised to confer with National Assembly leaders to </p><p>prioritize projects within existing resources. </p><p>Meanwhile, either believing that they had done their </p><p>legislative duty or to escape criticism, both houses </p><p>went into recess immediately after passing the budget </p><p>- - leaving unexplained much of the detail of their </p><p>measure, especially how they would finance it. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) If, as the Appropriations Chair of the House </p><p>claims, revenue assumptions are oil at USD 18 per </p><p>barrel and production of 1.8 million barrels per day </p><p>(b/d), GON projected revenue will be only N633 billion </p><p>(USD 5.5 billion).  A far cry far from the N1.06 </p><p>trillion needed to balance the Assembly\'s proposed </p><p>budget, and privatization -- particularly given the </p><p>implosion of the NITEL sale -- can no longer be </p><p>expected to cover much of the shortfall. The recent </p><p>increase in world oil prices will help to some degree </p><p>but not enough to bring the Assembly\'s desired budget </p><p>into balance. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Even with the deficit projected under the </p><p>Assembly\'s proposed budget, the differential between </p><p>actual and anticipated oil revenues may be treated as </p><p>"excess oil proceeds" (any revenue above the budget\'s </p><p>projected oil price).  In the past, the Administration </p><p>withheld these funds from the Federation Account </p><p>(which is distributed in a formula to Federal, States </p><p>and Local Governments) to use them for discretionary </p><p>projects outside the budget. In 2001, States and the </p><p>National Assembly eventually forced the Executive to </p><p>share some of these excess funds, resulting in a </p><p>significant influx of liquidity that served to worsen </p><p>inflation and increase downward pressure on the Naira. </p><p>Should the GON begin to realize any "excess oil </p><p>proceeds," there will be even more pressure from the </p><p>States for access to some of these funds given the </p><p>impending electoral season and the current fiscal </p><p>crunch experienced by many states when oil prices fell </p><p>after September 11. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>THE NORTH SHALL RISE AGAIN </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) On March 27 and 28, the Arewa Consultative </p><p>Forum (ACF) marked its 2nd anniversary by hosting a </p><p>seminar on peace and unity in Nigeria.  The two-day </p><p>program consisted of three plenary sessions on issues </p><p>relevant to Northern Nigeria; the second day was </p><p>labeled a civic ceremony in which government officials </p><p>addressed the forum about its goals. National unity </p><p>and the survival of democracy were two of the first </p><p>day\'s main issues.  Speakers the first day gave frank </p><p>appraisals of the current strife between Muslims and </p><p>Christians, this strife\'s effect on Nigeria\'s </p><p>progress.  Former President Gowon quoted reading a </p><p>"U.S. State Department Intelligence Report" in which </p><p>the religious differences and ethnic fractures were </p><p>described as moving from bad to worse. Rather than </p><p>condemning the U.S. for the report, Gowon stated the </p><p>report accurately reflected how Nigeria was viewed by </p><p>the rest of the world.  He further stated that </p><p>Nigerians must work to change this perception. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) A member of the Oputa panel (Human Rights </p><p>Violation Investigation Panel), Reverend Matthew Kukah </p><p>also addressed the need for unity, declaring that </p><p>Nigeria cannot survive if internally divided.  Kukah </p><p>went on to say that if Nigerian democracy is to </p><p>succeed the people must have realistic expectations of </p><p>democracy and understand that citizens have certain </p><p>responsibilities in a democracy as well. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) The second day of the forum was not quite as </p><p>congenial.  In a talk entitled "Politics and the </p><p>North," Governor Bafarawa (APP) of Sokoto State shot a </p><p>broadside at the Obasanjo Administration. Billed as </p><p>speaking on behalf of all 19 governors of the northern </p><p>region, Bafarawa credited the North with political </p><p>selflessness in backing Obasanjo for President in </p><p>1999, because Obasanjo was seen as a "detribalized" </p><p>leader at the time.  However, since then, Obasanjo has </p><p>proven to be an ingrate. "Today, it is 34 months that </p><p>the President has been in office.  Unfortunately, </p><p>however, instead of helping the North to prosper, the </p><p>foundations for sustainable development laid by our </p><p>past leaders are regrettably being systematically </p><p>destroyed with brazen recklessness." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) The Sokoto Governor listed three major factors </p><p>in his denunciation of Obasanjo: indiscriminate </p><p>dismissal of Northerners from federal jobs, unfair </p><p>distribution of funds for federal projects, and </p><p>unchecked violence against Northerners in Southern </p><p>States. Calling on all Northern Governors to oppose </p><p>Obasanjo\'s reelection, Bafarawa continued that </p><p>Northerners must band together, notwithstanding party </p><p>affiliation, for the 2003 elections in order to </p><p>restore the region\'s "lost glory."  Laden with </p><p>regional chauvinism, Bafarawa\'s peroration, calling </p><p>for a united North, was greeted by loud applause. In </p><p>contrast, Minister of the Federal Capital territory </p><p>addressed the ACF on behalf of Vice President Atiku. </p><p>Atiku\'s theme was that the North should not blame </p><p>others for its plight; its  problems rest squarely on </p><p>the shoulders of the Northern elite.  He stated that </p><p>Northerners have viewed political power as an end in </p><p>itself and not a means to an end, such as economic </p><p>development. Predictably, Atiku\'s statement did not </p><p>generate the same reaction as Bafarawa\'s. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) COMMENT: The applause elicited by the </p><p>Governor\'s statement does not mask the fissures in </p><p>Northern Nigeria\'s political topography. Despite </p><p>Bafarawa and other anti-Obasanjo ACF voices, a handful </p><p>of influential Northerners have recently spoken in </p><p>favor of Obasanjo. Additionally, Father Kukah told the </p><p>ACF gathering that de facto religious discrimination </p><p>impeding not only economic development but also the </p><p>prospects for political unity in North between members </p><p>of the different religions. Privately, Kukah told us </p><p>that the ACF event was controlled by members of the </p><p>opposition APP and other Obasanjo critics to give the </p><p>appearance of Northern unity against the President. </p><p>End Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>ARM TWISTING AT OTA </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) In an attempt to douse Bafarawa\'s incendiary </p><p>and short circuit other outbursts against a possible </p><p>Obasanjo reelection bid, Works Minister Tony Anenih, </p><p>the consummate mechanic of political deals, engineered </p><p>a procession of PDP governors, party officials and </p><p>others to visit Obasanjo at his farm in Ota during the </p><p>Easter weekend.  Receiving massive media coverage, the </p><p>event was characterized as a show of support for an </p><p>Obasanjo bid at a second term. Speculation ran rife </p><p>that President Obasanjo would announce his intentions </p><p>regarding the 2003 elections at that time. While the </p><p>President maintained his silence, this event seemed to </p><p>indicate that a reelection bid was more probable than </p><p>not. However, not everyone was happy to be in Ota. We </p><p>have gathered from a few sources that Anenih put the </p><p>squeeze on the PDP governors. Reportedly, he </p><p>threatened that the federal government would be </p><p>miserly toward states whose governors failed to </p><p>appear. Conversely, he promised some private pocket </p><p>money for those state chief executives who were </p><p>present. (Note. All PDP governors, except Abia </p><p>Governor Kalu, who has battled publicly with Obasanjo </p><p>attended. End note) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Despite Anenih\'s legerdermain, the Governors </p><p>did not endorse Obasanjo, according to Kaduna State </p><p>Governor Marakfi. Makarfi contends that the Governors </p><p>did not say they would back Obasanjo. Instead, they </p><p>demanded that Obasanjo make up his mind and publicly </p><p>state his electoral intentions. Anenih, abetted by </p><p>Information Minister Jerry Gana, craftily gave a </p><p>positive media spin turning what, in effect, was </p><p>intended to be an ultimatum from the Governor\'s into a </p><p>"demand" that Obasanjo seek reelection. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>AFTER THE SAFIYA HUSSEINI VERDICT </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) Emboff met Safiya Hussieni\'s lead attorney </p><p>April 2 to further discuss the appellate court </p><p>reversal of Husseieni\'s stoning sentence. The </p><p>attorney, Hauwa Ibrahim, generally commended the </p><p>appellate court decision and the manner in which it </p><p>was rendered. Ibrahim recalled that the gallery was </p><p>full of anticipation as the judge began to read the </p><p>verdict. Once she gathered that the court would </p><p>reverse the sentence, Ibrahim worried that the gallery </p><p>might erupt violently. Fortunately, the judge </p><p>tactfully diffused emotions, by liberally lacing his </p><p>decision with quotes from the Koran and taking over 2 </p><p>hours to read the judgment. Still, Ibrahim said, there </p><p>was agitation among the Sharia hard-liners in the </p><p>gallery.  Because of this hard-line element, Ibrahim </p><p>made special arrangements with local police </p><p>authorities to secret Safiya out of the courtroom and </p><p>to a safe house until things quiet. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) While praising the rulings (particularly its </p><p>affirmation of a defendant\'s right to withdraw a </p><p>confession at any time under Sharia), Ibrahim pointed </p><p>to some lacunae in the court\'s reasoning. She claimed </p><p>the court cited the Federal Constitution as giving the </p><p>Sokoto State Assembly the authority to enact criminal </p><p>Sharia legislation. However, she criticized the court </p><p>for purposely sidestepping Safiya\'s contention that, </p><p>if the Constitution is the organic authority for the </p><p>State\'s criminal Sharia code, then the constitutional </p><p>bar against cruel and unusual punishment should </p><p>likewise apply to the penalties that can be imposed </p><p>under Sharia.  The second important issue the Court </p><p>overlooked was the defense contention that the Koran </p><p>did not mandate a stoning sentence for adultery. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) Ibrahim is also counsel for the three other </p><p>women in Sokoto facing similar stoning sentences.  She </p><p>will likely help in the case in Katsina State as well. </p><p>She hoped that the Husseini decision will set a </p><p>precedent and stated that she has moved quickly to </p><p>provide copies of the decision to the judges in the </p><p>other Sokoto cases.  However, one case appears to be </p><p>very difficult. In this case, the woman not only </p><p>admitted to adultery but she abandoned the child who </p><p>died as a result.  Ibrahim commented there would be </p><p>little local sympathy for this defendant and that </p><p>there will be a clamor for a harsh sentence because of </p><p>the infanticide. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>SHOW ME WHERE TO PRINT THE MONEY </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. (U) In the aftermath of the NITEL privatization </p><p>failure, government\'s decision to privatize the </p><p>Nigerian Mint has come under increased scrutiny. </p><p>Typical of most parastatals, the Mint is inefficient. </p><p>However, the symbolic importance of government </p><p>ownership resonates with many Nigerians. Obasanjo </p><p>critics, particularly in the House of Representatives, </p><p>have found this too easy an opportunity to pass up. </p><p>PDP rival and former Governor of Kano State Abubakar </p><p>Rimi is Chairman of the Mint, and he has engaged, </p><p>along with many members of the National Assembly, in a </p><p>campaign to prevent the sale. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15. (U) So far, the President seems adamant, as is </p><p>Bureau of Public Enterprises Director General Nasir </p><p>el-Rufai, who is more determined than ever after being </p><p>called on the carpet by the National Assembly for the </p><p>failed NITEL sale.  Compared to NITEL and some of the </p><p>other projects, the Mint is fairly small potatoes. </p><p>Nonetheless, it will be interesting to see if el-Rufai </p><p>can overcome doubts (specious ones) about the </p><p>currency\'s security and refute accusations that he is </p><p>giving away Nigeria\'s sovereignty.  To date, one of </p><p>his more strident responses to criticism has been to </p><p>say incompetence in the Mint has forced Nigerians to </p><p>depend on "white men in Germany and England" to print </p><p>their money. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
