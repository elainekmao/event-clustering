<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 003548 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  09/12/01 </p><p>TAGS:  PTER, EWWT, MOPS, CE </p><p>SUBJECT:  MORE ON THE LTTE ATTACK ON </p><p>US-CHARTERED MV CORDIALITY - A NEW LTTE </p><p>TACTIC? </p><p> </p><p>REF:  COLOMBO 03477 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  CLASSIFIED BY POLITICAL COUNSELOR </p><p>ANDREW MANN.  REASON:  1.5 (D). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  THE OWNER OF THE COMPANY HIRED TO </p><p>SALVAGE MV CORDIALITY WHICH WAS ATTACKED IN </p><p>THE EARLY MORNING HOURS ON SEPTEMBER 9 (SEE </p><p>REFTEL) HAS PROVIDED ADDITIONAL DETAILS OF </p><p>THE ATTACK.  THE SHIP HAD BEEN LOADING </p><p>ILMENITE FOR OVER A WEEK, USING LARGE </p><p>NUMBERS OF LOCAL WORKERS.  IT HELD ALMOST </p><p>29,000 TONS OF AN ESTIMATED 30,000 TON LOAD </p><p>AT THE TIME OF THE ATTACK.  THE SHIP WAS </p><p>SURROUNDED BY A NUMBER OF SRI LANKA NAVAL </p><p>CRAFT. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  EVIDENTLY, THE LTTE TOOK ADVANTAGE </p><p>OF AN UNSECURED GANGPLANK TO GAIN ENTRY </p><p>ONTO THE SHIP QUICKLY.  THEY THREW GRENADES </p><p>INTO THE ENGINE ROOM CAUSING EXTENSIVE </p><p>DAMAGE.  THE SALVAGE COMPANY OWNER SAID THE </p><p>LTTE TRIED TO TAKE SOME OF THE CHINESE CREW </p><p>MEMBERS HOSTAGE.  IT IS NOT KNOWN IF IT WAS </p><p>SUCCESSFUL.  FIVE CREW MEMBERS ARE STILL </p><p>MISSING. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  FIRE FROM THE GRENADE ATTACK </p><p>SPREAD TO SOME OF THE LIVING QUARTERS.  THE </p><p>FIRES WERE DOUSED BY SLN FORCES RESPONDING </p><p>TO THE ATTACK, BUT THE ENGINE ROOM WAS </p><p>EFFECTIVELY DESTROYED.  DUE TO THE AMOUNT </p><p>OF WATER USED TO COMBAT THE FLAMES, THE </p><p>STERN NOW SITS LOWER IN THE WATER THAN THE </p><p>BOW.  DURING THE ATTACK, RPG\'S HAD RIPPED </p><p>THROUGH THE SIDE OF THE SHIP BUT ABOVE THE </p><p>WATER LINE.  THE SHIP WAS/IS NOT IN DANGER </p><p>OF SINKING.  THE SHIP IS TOWABLE TO EITHER </p><p>TRINCOMALEE OR COLOMBO DEPENDING UPON THE </p><p>DETERMINATION OF THE INSURANCE COMPANY. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  IN A FAX FROM ITS LONDON OFFICE, </p><p>THE LTTE JUSTIFIED ITS ATTACK ON MV </p><p>CORDIALITY:  "THE ROBBERY OF OUR NATURAL </p><p>RESOURCES BY THE RELENTLESS ENEMY CANNOT BE </p><p>PERMITTED."  IT ARGUED THE ILMENITE WAS A </p><p>NATURAL RESOURSE OF TAMIL EELAM, BEING </p><p>"SYSTEMATICALLY PLUNDERED" BY THE SINHALA </p><p>GOVERNMENT TO BE SOLD ABROAD WITH THE </p><p>PROCEEDS USED TO PURCHASE ARMS AGAINST THE </p><p>TAMIL PEOPLE. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  PERHAPS IN RESPONSE TO THE USG </p><p>JULY 25 STATEMENT CONDEMNING LTTE </p><p>INTERFERENCE WITH INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING, </p><p>THE LTTE SAID ITS ATTACK "SHOULD NOT BE </p><p>CONSTRUED AS AN ACT OF HOSTILITY DIRECTED </p><p>TOWARDS ANY PARTICULAR TRADE OR SHIPPING </p><p>ORGANIZATION.  NEITHER SHOULD IT BE </p><p>INFERRED AS AN ACT PREJUDICIAL TO </p><p>INTERNATIONAL TRADE OR SHIPPING."  THE LTTE </p><p>STATEMENT EXPRESSED REGRET FOR THE LOSS OF </p><p>LIFE, BUT THE ORGANIZATION, IT CLAIMED, HAS </p><p>COMPELLED TO ACT IN ORDER TO PREVENT THE </p><p>REMOVAL AND SALE OF EELAM RESOURCES AND TO </p><p>"BEAT THE WAR STRATEGY" OF THE GSL. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  COMMENT.  THE LTTE HAS PREVIOUSLY </p><p>ATTACKED FOREIGN-FLAGGED COMMERCIAL VESSELS </p><p>(MAY 97 ATTACK ON GREEK CARGO SHIP OUTSIDE </p><p>TRINCOMALEE; AUGUST 96 ATTACK OF </p><p>JAPANESE-OWNED, PHILIPPINE-FLAGGED CARGO </p><p>SHIP IN PULMODDAI - NEAR THE SITE OF THE </p><p>RECENT ATTACK (THE LTTE REFERRED TO THIS </p><p>ATTACK IN ITS FAX); APRIL 96 ATTACK ON </p><p>COLOMBO HARBOR LEAVING THREE CARGO SHIPS </p><p>SLIGHTLY DAMAGED) IN ADDITION TO ITS JULY </p><p>ATTACKS ON AN INDONESIA-FLAGGED PASSENGER </p><p>FERRY AND A NORTH KOREAN CARGO SHIP.  THE </p><p>LTTE HAD ALSO SAID IN THE PAST ANY VESSEL </p><p>(FOREIGN-OWNED OR SRI LANKAN) IN "TAMIL </p><p>TERRITORIAL WATERS" ENGAGED IN "ACTIVITIES </p><p>ASSOCIATED WITH THE SRI LANKAN MILITARY" </p><p>WILL BE CONSIDERED A LEGITIMATE TARGET. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  THIS ATTACK IS WORRISOME FOR TWO </p><p>REASONS.  FIRST, THE LTTE APPEARS WILLING </p><p>TO ENGAGE A MAJOR POWER.  OUR SOURCE SAID </p><p>IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE NOT TO HAVE KNOWN THE </p><p>SHIP WAS CHINESE-OWNED AFTER A WEEK AT </p><p>ANCHOR.  SECONDLY, THE ECONOMIC </p><p>JUSTIFICATION USED BY THE LTTE COULD PUT </p><p>ALL ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IN THE NORTH EAST AT </p><p>RISK.  THIS ATTACK MAY SIGNAL THE GSL\'S </p><p>EFFORTS TO TAKE THE WAR TO THE LTTE IS </p><p>HAVING SOME SUCCESS IN SQUEEZING IT.  THE </p><p>LTTE MAY BE LASHING OUT TO CAUSE THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT TO DIVERT RESOURCES TO PROTECT </p><p>ECONOMIC ACTIVITY, THUS GIVING THE LTTE A </p><p>BREAK ON THE GROUND AND SEA.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SMYTH </p><p></p></div>
