<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 000678 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/27/2013 </p><p>TAGS: KCRM, PHUM, KWMN, SMIG, KFRD, ASEC, PREF, ELAB, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: GOT FOCUSES EFFORTS ON ANTI-TRAFFICKING INITIATIVES </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 419 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified Polcouns John Kunstadter; reasons 1.5 (b) and </p><p>(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) This is an action request; please see para 6. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Jan. 23 MFA DDG for Consular Affairs Topcuoglu called </p><p>us in to discuss GOT developments in the fight against </p><p>trafficking-in-persons (TIP).  Topcuoglu stressed local, </p><p>regional, and national efforts to raise awareness of the </p><p>issue, prosecute individuals accused of TIP, and assist TIP </p><p>victims. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Recent GOT initiatives include: </p><p>- Implementation of anti-trafficking law- Article 201 (b)- </p><p>which was passed in August 2002.  While definitive </p><p>information from the GOT Records Department is pending, MFA </p><p>highlighted four cases currently pending in local Turkish </p><p>courts.  Two trials are ongoing (one on the Black Sea Coast </p><p>and one in eastern Turkey) while two cases accusing multiple </p><p>individuals of TIP are continuing in Istanbul. </p><p>- Draft law centralizing the issuance of work permits in the </p><p>Ministry of Labor has been submitted to Parliament. </p><p>Currently, multiple Ministries, including Ministries of </p><p>Education, Tourism, and Labor, have the right to give </p><p>preliminary permission to issue work permits.  The annex to </p><p>the law will set up a work permit system for women to work in </p><p>domestic services.  Passage of this law would allow for </p><p>tighter examination of who is applying and receiving work </p><p>permits. </p><p>- Establishment of a coordination committee for TIP within </p><p>the Ministry of Interior.  Various departments are </p><p>represented, including Foreigners and Borders departments, </p><p>Organized Crime and Smuggling department, and Public Security </p><p>department. </p><p>- Governors of 15 cities, believed to be principal </p><p>destination points for victims of TIP, are exploring the idea </p><p>of converting state-owned unused social training centers to </p><p>shelters for TIP victims. </p><p>- Governorates of same 15 cities have been instructed by the </p><p>Ministry of Interior to issue humanitarian visas and </p><p>temporary residence permits for TIP victims to begin the </p><p>rehabilitation process. </p><p>- Ministry of Interior will give the first training program </p><p>to raise awareness of the TIP issue to 75 officers from 15 </p><p>provinces in the next few months. </p><p>- The Directorate on the Problems and Status of Women held a </p><p>panel in December 2002 on the issue of TIP.  The 200 plus </p><p>attendees included NGO representatives, journalists, police </p><p>chiefs, and MFA officials.  According to the MFA, each group </p><p>offered a different perspective of the situation but believed </p><p>both GOT agencies and NGOs must work together to assist </p><p>victims. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Emb requested a copy of GOT\'s national action plan and </p><p>timeline for the implementation of projects.  Topcuoglu </p><p>responded that the next meeting of the inter-agency working </p><p>group is imminent and claimed the plan would be completed </p><p>then.  Topcuoglu continued that shelter openings were a </p><p>"medium term" issue to be resolved, since buildings must be </p><p>identified and then NGOs would take over the management of </p><p>the shelter. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>Comment and Action Request </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Comment.  These significant initiatives illustrate GOT </p><p>steps to focus on concrete actions to combat the problem of </p><p>trafficking.  These set GOT anti-TIP actions in motion on a </p><p>national level and demonstrate the GOT\'s commitment to </p><p>increasing victim assistance and prosecuting perpetrators of </p><p>trafficking-in-persons. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Action request.  MFA DDG Firat Fatma Topcuoglu will </p><p>attend G/TIP conference in February "Pathbreaking Strategies </p><p>in the Global Fight Against Sex Trafficking."  Embassy </p><p>reiterates its request for a meeting between G/TIP director </p><p>Miller and Topcuoglu (reftel).  Such a meeting would help GOT </p><p>continue to focus its efforts on combating TIP. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
