Jeter; Reasons 1.6X5, </p><p>1.6X6, 1.6X8. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>======= </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>======= </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (S/NF) SUMMARY: Ambassador Jeter and President Obasanjo </p><p>discussed a smorgasbord of issues over a lengthy breakfast on </p><p>August 24.  The President said he would do everything </p><p>possible to meet the counter-narcotics benchmarks, but he </p><p>admitted that the Nigerian judiciary was broken and offered </p><p>to render additional suspects to the U.S. if it would mean </p><p>Nigeria\'s certification.  He confirmed that 250 million Naira </p><p>had been set aside for the NDLEA in the supplemental budget. </p><p>During the breakfast, Obasanjo called the Acting Minister of </p><p>Defense and demanded results on security assistance.  He </p><p>agreed to the UNAMSIL troop rotation schedule requested by </p><p>the U.S.  Obasanjo offered cautious assent to training for </p><p>the four Guinean companies, but warned against actions that </p><p>would threaten Qadhafi in the sub-region.  The President said </p><p>that Nigeria would remain neutral on the replacement of the </p><p>ECOWAS Executive Secretary, but strongly implied support for </p><p>the Ghanaian candidate.  Finally, Obasanjo commented on his </p><p>plans for the WCAR, and gave his personal and private </p><p>insights into the Middle East conflict.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Ambassador Jeter was accompanied to the meeting by </p><p>his Staff Assistant (notetaker).  Ahmed Jodu, the Chairman of </p><p>the Nigerian Communications Commission and Adobe Obe, the </p><p>President\'s Special Assistant (and an influential advisor) </p><p>also attended the working breakfast.  In the last few </p><p>minutes, Magnus Kpakol, the new Chief Economic Advisor to the </p><p>President (and a twenty-year Dallas resident) joined the </p><p>early morning gathering. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>===================================== </p><p>COUNTER-NARCOTICS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT </p><p>===================================== </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Ambassador Jeter emphasized that there existed a </p><p>perception that Nigeria was off-track on meeting </p><p>counter-narcotics benchmarks (Ref C), and passed the </p><p>President the non-paper relayed in Ref A.  The Ambassador </p><p>explained that the certification process was an annual event, </p><p>and that Nigeria would have to do more.  Drugs had been </p><p>discovered on the South Africa Airways/Nigerian Airways </p><p>flight to New York, the NDLEA-DEA joint taskforce was </p><p>moribund, and while the President had agreed to double the </p><p>NDLEA budget, the Embassy had seen no evidence that NDLEA had </p><p>received additional resources.  Moreover, Nigeria had not </p><p>even bothered to answer the FATF survey.  Finally, no </p><p>progress had been made towards extradition of wanted </p><p>fugitives. Ambassador Jeter emphasized that we all knew who </p><p>these people were, and that they were making huge amounts of </p><p>money, damaging Nigeria\'s image and harming Americans. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) In response, President Obasanjo said, "I gave more </p><p>money to NDLEA," and picked up his phone and called his </p><p>Principal Secretary, Stephen Oronsaye.  Confirming that 250 </p><p>million Naira had been put in the supplemental budget, the </p><p>President turned to the Ambassador and said he would speak to </p><p>the Minister of Finance to make sure the money was released </p><p>to NDLEA quickly.  Turning to the SAA/NA flight, the </p><p>President thanked the Ambassador for forwarding details on </p><p>one of the drug traffickers captured at JFK.  He stated that, </p><p>armed with that information, he had demanded a full </p><p>accounting of those on duty at that time at MMIA (the Lagos </p><p>international airport). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (S/NF) Turning to the subject of extradition, Obasanjo </p><p>said, "Howard, we will do everything we can that you ask on </p><p>counter-narcotics, but I have to be honest with you."  The </p><p>President then went on to explain that he did not think the </p><p>extradition process could be fixed.  Recognizing the realties </p><p>of a moribund judicial system, unresponsive and rife with </p><p>corruption, Obasanjo referred to the renditions ("what we did </p><p>last year") and offered, "If we need to do that again to be </p><p>certified, we will do it."  Extending his hands in the air to </p><p>thank the Almighty, he remarked, "We got off lightly last </p><p>time."  Ambassador Jeter thanked the President for his </p><p>willingness to cooperate, and said he would pass the offer of </p><p>renditions to Washington, but emphasized that the U.S. wanted </p><p>to see Nigeria extradite fugitives through a judicial process </p><p>with respect for the rule of law and the civil rights of the </p><p>individuals concerned.  We were worried about human rights. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (S/NF) The President said he would speak to the Minister </p><p>of State for Justice, a "good man," to see if he could </p><p>recharge the effort for a working extradition process.  He </p><p>also noted that Mohammed Belgore, Chief Judge of the Federal </p><p>High Court, and, "one of the most corrupt people in Nigeria," </p><p>had retired.  Justice Jinadu would cover the post for several </p><p>weeks, and then would retire and be replaced by a new Chief </p><p>Judge, who might be more willing to establish an extradition </p><p>court.  (NOTE:  The President did not say who the new Chief </p><p>Judge would be, but said he expected a woman to be selected. </p><p>END NOTE.)  However, the United States would have to </p><p>recognize the realities he faced on this issue, the President </p><p>emphasized, reminding the Ambassador that he was subject to a </p><p>constitutional separation of powers and could not inject </p><p>himself into the running of the courts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) The Ambassador asked the President how he planned to </p><p>recruit 40,000 police a year and make sure they had the </p><p>training needed to be effective.  This was a concern for us </p><p>because we recognized that Nigeria had neither the trainers </p><p>nor facilities to adequately prepare such large numbers for </p><p>effective policing.  The President reminded the Ambassador </p><p>that he had recently turned over some empty military barracks </p><p>to the police. However, he urged Nigeria needed U.S. help, </p><p>and asked the Ambassador about police training.  "We need </p><p>train-the-trainer and training aids for our institutions, and </p><p>thought you were going to help us with this," he said. </p><p>Ambassador Jeter stated he hoped to have an answer soon on </p><p>the police reform program and what U.S. assistance might be </p><p>forthcoming. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>================ </p><p>MILITARY MATTERS </p><p>================ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Security Assistance: Ambassador Jeter provided the </p><p>President an update on the work of the Embassy with the </p><p>Acting Minister of Defense (Army Minister Lawal Batagarawa) </p><p>on the Embassy\'s security assistance program.  There had been </p><p>real problems with the Ministry of Defense\'s Legal Director </p><p>demanding changes to the text of LOA\'s that we could not </p><p>legally change, and some communications issues, the sum of </p><p>which had stalled progress on completing the assistance. </p><p>Batagarawa had helped make significant progress, the </p><p>Ambassador said.  The President, assuming this was a veiled </p><p>criticism of Minister of Defense Danjuma, explained that the </p><p>one great tragedy of his Presidency had been the illness of </p><p>Danjuma.  Danjuma, the President said, when he was not sick, </p><p>was "the best," and "top notch." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Ambassador Jeter clarified, explaining that he had not </p><p>meant to say anything negative about Danjuma, only that, </p><p>during Minister Danjuma\'s absence, Batagarawa had been </p><p>working with the Embassy on this issue and had been very, </p><p>very helpful.  The President, smiling, immediately picked up </p><p>the phone and called Batagarawa, we thought to compliment </p><p>him.  Instead, however, he demanded an update and to know why </p><p>there was a problem.  "Ah! What are you doing?  They are </p><p>giving us this equipment!  Who is the problem?  Tell her I </p><p>said to sign the papers!"  (COMMENT:  Later that day, </p><p>Ambassador Jeter called Batagarawa to explain that he had </p><p>complimented him to the President, and had not tried to go </p><p>above his head.  Batagarawa thanked the Ambassador, and said </p><p>that even if the Ambassador had gone to the President, it </p><p>would have been okay, because now he had the word of the </p><p>President as ammunition to fix the security assistance </p><p>problem in the Ministry.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) OFR ROTATIONS:  The Ambassador asked the President if </p><p>he would be willing to adjust the schedules of the Nigerian </p><p>battalions in Sierra Leone due to rotate out in September, </p><p>retaining one battalion until January (Ref E).  The President </p><p>replied that he would have them both remain until January if </p><p>that was what the U.S. wanted.  Ambassador Jeter explained </p><p>that if one rotated out in September and one in January, the </p><p>latter battalion could rotate out with two others due to </p><p>rotate in January, and all three could be replaced by the </p><p>three OFR phase III battalions.  That way, the three OFR </p><p>battalions could use their new skills and equipment </p><p>immediately without risk of those skills diminishing.  The </p><p>President willingly agreed, and said he would so inform the </p><p>Chief of Army Staff. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) TRAINING OF GUINEAN ARMY COMPANIES: Ambassador Jeter </p><p>told the President of the plans to train four Guinean Army </p><p>companies (Ref F).  The President immediately reacted </p><p>strongly, urging the U.S. to "be careful."  He described </p><p>President Conte as "just as stubborn" as President Taylor. </p><p>Too much power in Conte\'s hands could cause Qadhafi to </p><p>perceive a threat to his client states in the sub-region. </p><p>The President remarked that Qadhafi had "one-thousand </p><p>aircraft and one-thousand tanks at his disposal."  If he </p><p>attacked Nigeria, Obasanjo blustered, "I would stop his tanks </p><p>and bring down his aircraft with anti-aircraft guns." </p><p>However, if Qadhafi attacked Guinea or another state in the </p><p>sub-region, Nigeria would not come to their defense. </p><p>Moreover, Obasanjo believed, too much power in Conte\'s hands </p><p>was a risk to Liberia, and a vacuum in Liberia would invite </p><p>Qadhafi\'s meddling.  Ambassador Jeter explained that training </p><p>the four companies was modest, would include intensive human </p><p>rights training, require guarantees that the training could </p><p>only be used for self-defense, and a commitment the companies </p><p>could only cross borders in hot-pursuit.  We were helping </p><p>Guinea because we wanted the country to be able to defend </p><p>itself.  Obasanjo said that was fine, but reiterated his </p><p>warning to "be careful."  (NOTE: Later, Ambassador Jeter </p><p>informed the Acting Minister of Defense about the training. </p><p>Batagarawa said that the effort was useful, and thanked the </p><p>U.S. for its help.  END NOTE). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>======================== </p><p>WCAR AND THE MIDDLE EAST </p><p>======================== </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) Ambassador Jeter thanked the President for his </p><p>efforts to make the WCAR forward-looking, particularly in </p><p>regards to reparations and slavery.  Obasanjo said he would </p><p>attend the conference, and would speak publicly on those </p><p>issues, but would not take a position on the Middle East </p><p>conflict.  The conflict was "too complicated," the President </p><p>opined.  He then asked if Secretary of State Powell would </p><p>attend the WCAR.  Ambassador Jeter informed the President </p><p>that a decision whether the U.S. would attend, and who would </p><p>lead the delegation, had not yet been made.  Obasanjo began </p><p>to say he would like to ask Secretary Powell to be there; </p><p>however, he then said he would not ask, because the </p><p>Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and how it would be handled in </p><p>the WCAR, remained unresolved.  He recognized that this was a </p><p>serious problem for the U.S. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) President Obasanjo then shared some of his views on </p><p>the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  Asserting that he would </p><p>not say this publicly, the President believed that Arafat had </p><p>made "a huge mistake" by refusing to reach agreement at Camp </p><p>David.  He never expected the Israelis to offer as much as </p><p>they did, and all that stood between that offer and Arafat\'s </p><p>demands were certain "small details" relating to Jerusalem. </p><p>Arafat should have accepted the deal, Obasanjo declared, </p><p>while insisting that discussions continue on unresolved </p><p>matters.  He then compared Arafat\'s "mistake" to that of </p><p>Saddam Hussein in opposing the U.S. in the Gulf.  The </p><p>President remarked that, had he been in Hussein\'s shoes on </p><p>January 14, 1991, he would have used the eight-hour time </p><p>difference between Baghdad and Washington to hold a victory </p><p>rally.  Once having claimed victory over the U.S., he would </p><p>have withdrawn his forces, still within the eight-hour window. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>=============== </p><p>U.S. INVESTMENT </p><p>=============== </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) The President asked the Ambassador why so few </p><p>American companies were investing in Nigeria.  The Ambassador </p><p>explained that many American companies saw too much risk, and </p><p>did not see enough transparency.  The Ambassador referred to </p><p>the National Identity Card tendering process, where Polaroid </p><p>felt that they, as a part of the Chams, had been unfairly </p><p>passed over for SAGEM, the French consortium.  Obasanjo </p><p>remarked that both he and Ambassador Jeter had been at the </p><p>meeting with all of the bidders, and emphasized that no one </p><p>company from the Chams consortium had answered his question </p><p>of who would ultimately be responsible for the entire </p><p>project.  The President further commented that American </p><p>companies did not need to partner with a Nigerian company in </p><p>order to win public contracts.  That may have been true under </p><p>previous Administrations, he stated, but was not now true. </p><p>Ambassador Jeter urged the President to share these views </p><p>with the Watts CODEL the following week, to which the </p><p>President agreed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>======================================= </p><p>THE RACE FOR ECOWAS EXECUTIVE SECRETARY </p><p>======================================= </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15. (C) Ambassador Jeter asked who Nigeria favored to replace </p><p>Lansana Kouyate as ECOWAS Executive Secretary, emphasizing </p><p>the need for strong leadership of the regional Secretariat. </p><p>We wanted to help ECOWAS in a way we had not before, and </p><p>strong ECOWAS leadership would determine what we would be </p><p>able to do.  Obasanjo noted that there were three candidates </p><p>in the race.  He suggested quiet, behind-the-scenes support </p><p>for Ghana\'s Chambas, but promised public silence until </p><p>consensus emerged.  (COMMENT: After the meeting, Ambassador </p><p>Jeter discussed this point further with Adobe Obe.  Adobe </p><p>indicated that Nigeria wanted to be careful not to appear as </p><p>pre-determining the process by throwing it weight behind one </p><p>candidate.  Adobe calculated that besides Benin and the </p><p>Gambia -- with their own candidates -- only Senegal and Cote </p><p>d\'Ivoire were likely to pull against Chambas as a consensus </p><p>candidate.  Adobe opined that some Francophone countries were </p><p>focusing on UEMOA at the expense of ECOWAS, and Nigeria was </p><p>loathe to give them ammunition by pushing hard for Chambas. </p><p>He also observed that France could help keep the Francophone </p><p>countries engaged with ECOWAS.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>======= </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>======= </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16. (C) During the nearly two-hour encounter, Obasanjo was </p><p>relaxed, happy, engaged, even bubbly.  Obasanjo\'s comments on </p><p>the role of Libya in the sub-region and the situation in the </p><p>Middle East were revealing. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>17. (C) Peppering the meal were phone calls out to Ministers </p><p>and government officials to confirm certain facts, and phone </p><p>calls in from Governors.  The Governor of Ebonyi called about </p><p>a fatal security incident involving the Mobile Police; the </p><p>Governor of Plateau called to talk about a road desired by </p><p>Deputy Senate President Mantu.  In each case, the President </p><p>urged the Governors to use their own authority and resources </p><p>before asking for Presidential intervention.  Obasanjo seems </p><p>to be completely willing to defer Presidential decisions on </p><p>issues involving the states, and to push the governors to </p><p>exercise their own authority. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>18. (C) On the Federal level, however, President Obasanjo has </p><p>a tight grip on decision-making, and seems to delegate very </p><p>little authority to his Ministers.  As a result, we rarely </p><p>see a Minister make a decision without first consulting the </p><p>President.  Unfortunately, this system places a huge burden </p><p>on the President himself, while engendering gridlock in the </p><p>bureaucratic process.  The Embassy\'s access to the President, </p><p>on critical matters is therefore extremely important, and </p><p>casual encounters often seem to be the most productive. </p><p>However, this access cannot be abused, and we are careful not </p><p>to turn every social event into a business meeting. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>19. (C) On counter-narcotics, we will now wait and see what </p><p>impact this and other recent high-level approaches have on </p><p>the GON\'s efforts in this area.  However, we are now sure </p><p>that some additional NDLEA resources will be forthcoming, and </p><p>are hopeful this will have an impact on the NDLEA\'s ability </p><p>to move closer to its ambitious vision. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>20. (U) Freetown minimize considered. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
