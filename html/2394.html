<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 JERUSALEM 000143 </p><p> </p><p>NEA FOR BURNS/SATTERFIELD; NSC FOR REIDEL AND JOHNSON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/16/12 </p><p>TAGS: EAID, ECON, PTER, KWBG </p><p>SUBJECT: READYING PECDAR TO FILL THE "HAMAS GAP" </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY CONSUL-GENERAL RONALD SCHLICHER PER 1.5 (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  PECDAR DIRECTOR MOHAMMAD SHTAYYEH </p><p>REPORTS THAT HE HAS ARAFAT\'S BLESSING TO ESTABLISH PECDAR </p><p>RELIEF PROGRAMS THAT WOULD FILL THE ASSISTANCE GAP </p><p>RESULTING FROM THE PA\'S CLOSURE OF HAMAS-AFFILIATED </p><p>CHARITIES.  SHTAYYEH WELCOMED U.S. EFFORTS TO ENCOURAGE </p><p>GULF COUNTRIES TO STEER CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS AWAY </p><p>FROM HAMAS, AND WAS HAPPY TO HEAR THAT THE USG HAS </p><p>IDENTIFIED PECDAR HAS A CONSTRUCTIVE ALTERNATIVE.  HE WAS </p><p>CONFIDENT THAT PECDAR WAS UP TO THE TASK, CITING ITS 235- </p><p>PERSON STAFF AND A SOLID REPUTATION FOR TRANSPARENCY AND </p><p>EFFECTIVENESS.  SHTAYYEH IS PLANNING TO ESTABLISH A NEW </p><p>DEPARTMENT OF POVERTY ALLEVIATION AND RELIEF WITHIN </p><p>PECDAR THAT WOULD FOCUS ON WELFARE ASSISTANCE (PROVIDING </p><p>FOOD, CASH, AND HOUSING), JOB CREATION VIA MICRO- </p><p>GRANTS/LENDING AND A JOB PLACEMENT/SUBSIDY PROGRAM. </p><p>SHTAYYEH ARGUED STRONGLY THAT THE BEST WAY TO PUT HAMAS </p><p>OUT OF THE WELFARE BUSINESS IS TO PROVIDE BETTER SERVICES </p><p>THROUGH OTHER CHANNELS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>POSITIONING PECDAR TO FILL THE HAMAS GAP </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) IN A JANUARY 16 CONVERSATION WITH ECON CHIEF, </p><p>MOHAMMED SHTAYYEH -- DIRECTOR OF THE PALESTINIAN ECONOMIC </p><p>COUNCIL FOR DEVELOPMENT AND RECONSTRUCTION (PECDAR) -- </p><p>REPORTED THAT HE MET WITH ARAFAT SOON AFTER THE PA\'S </p><p>DECISION TO CLOSE THE HAMAS CHARITIES.  DURING THAT </p><p>MEETING, SHTAYYEH NOTED THAT THE PA\'S DECISION TO CLOSE </p><p>HAMAS-AFFILIATED CHARITIES AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS </p><p>THREATENS TO CREATE A SO-CALLED "HAMAS GAP," AS EMERGENCY </p><p>RELIEF AND OTHER ASSISTANCE PROVIDED BY THESE </p><p>INSTITUTIONS ENDS.  SHTAYYEH SAID HE HAD ADVOCATED WITH </p><p>ARAFAT THAT THE PA COULD NOT CLOSE THE CHARITIES WITHOUT </p><p>ENSURING THAT BENEFICIARIES CONTINUED TO RECEIVE </p><p>ASSISTANCE.  ARAFAT HAD AGREED AND ASKED FOR A PROPOSAL, </p><p>WHICH SHTAYYEH HAD PROVIDED IN THE FORM OF A BRIEF PAPER. </p><p>ARAFAT HAD APPROVED THE PAPER AND INSTRUCTED THAT IT </p><p>SHOULD BE DISTRIBUTED TO MINISTER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT </p><p>SA\'EB EREKAT AND MINISTER FOR NGO AFFAIRS HASSAN ASFOUR. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) SHTAYYEH REPORTED THAT ASFOUR HAD SUBSEQUENTLY </p><p>APPROACHED HIM TO SAY THAT HE WAS "PLEASED" WITH THE </p><p>INITIATIVE, BUT ALSO HAD SOME IDEAS OF HIS OWN.  IN </p><p>PARTICULAR, ASFOUR HAD STRESSED THE NEED TO WORK WITH </p><p>NGOS IN PROVIDING RELIEF.  MINISTER OF SOCIAL AFFAIRS </p><p>INTISSAR AL-WAZIR (UMM JIHAD) HAD ALSO CALLED HIM AND HAD </p><p>EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT SHTAYYEH WOULD BE IMPINGING ON THE </p><p>MINISTRY\'S OWN RELIEF EFFORTS.  SHTAYYEH HAD ASSURED HER </p><p>THAT HE WOULD WORK CLOSELY WITH THE MINISTRY.  SHTAYYEH </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THERE WOULD LIKELY BE ONGOING TURF </p><p>ISSUES NOT ONLY WITH THESE PA MINISTRIES BUT ALSO WITH </p><p>EXISTING (NON-HAMAS) NGOS.  HE HOPED PECDAR COULD OPERATE </p><p>AS A KIND OF BROKER BETWEEN DONORS, THE MINISTRY OF </p><p>SOCIAL AFFAIRS (WHO WOULD PROVIDE LISTS OF WELFARE CASES) </p><p>AND NGOS AND MUNICIPALITIES WHO WOULD BE INVOLVED IN </p><p>IMPLEMENTING PROGRAMS.  HE ALSO HOPED THAT OVER TIME </p><p>PECDAR COULD BECOME A CENTRALIZED VEHICLE FOR CHANNELING </p><p>ASSISTANCE FROM ZAKAT COMMITTEES (RESPONSIBLE FOR </p><p>COLLECTING AND DISBURSING ISLAMIC ALMS). </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) DESPITE THE FACT THAT PECDAR HAS BUILT ITS </p><p>REPUTATION ON IMPLEMENTATION OF CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS, </p><p>NOT SOCIAL WELFARE AND EMERGENCY RELIEF, SHTAYYEH ARGUED </p><p>THAT PECDAR WAS WELL POSITIONED TO FILL THE HAMAS GAP. </p><p>IT HAD A 235-PERSON STAFF, HE SAID, AND SINCE 1995 HAD </p><p>DISBURSED OVER $110 MILLION IN EMPLOYMENT GENERATION </p><p>PROJECTS FOR A VARIETY OF DONORS INCLUDING THE WORLD </p><p>BANK, GERMANY, AND SWEDEN.  IT WAS ALSO IMPLEMENTING A </p><p>COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM WITH THE WORLD BANK AND </p><p>MUCH OF ITS CONSTRUCTION WORK HAD FOCUSED ON SMALL-SCALE </p><p>PROJECTS RELATING TO SCHOOLS AND CLINICS. </p><p> </p><p>WHAT IF A MILLION DOLLARS ARRIVED TOMORROW? </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) ECON CHIEF INFORMED SHTAYYEH THAT THE USG HAS </p><p>URGED GULF COUNTRIES TO CONSIDER PECDAR AS A POLITICALLY </p><p>CONSTRUCTIVE CHANNEL FOR EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE TO THE </p><p>PALESTINIANS.  SHTAYYEH WAS APPRECIATIVE, AND WAS </p><p>CONFIDENT THAT IF NEW FUNDS FROM THE GULF ARRIVED HE </p><p>WOULD BE POSITIONED TO CHANNEL THE ASSISTANCE TOWARD </p><p>RELIEF ACTIVITIES.  ASKED WHAT HE WOULD DO IF A MILLION </p><p>DOLLARS ARRIVED TOMORROW, HE SAID HE WOULD FOCUS ON </p><p>EMERGENCY HOUSING AND FOOD AND CASH ASSISTANCE IN </p><p>SOUTHERN GAZA.  AS A FIRST STEP, IN ORDER TO ASSESS THE </p><p>DIMENSIONS OF THE CHALLENGE, SHTAYYEH HAD ALREADY ASKED </p><p>OFFICIALS IN THE SECURITY SERVICES TO PROVIDE HIM WITH A </p><p>LIST OF THE BENEFICIARIES OF THE HAMAS CHARITABLE </p><p>INSTITUTIONS THAT HAD BEEN SHUT DOWN. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A THREE PRONGED STRATEGY FOR PECDAR </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) LOOKING TO THE MEDIUM AND LONGER-TERM, SHTAYYEH </p><p>SAID HE HAD BEGUN DESIGNING A NEW PECDAR DEPARTMENT THAT </p><p>WILL FOCUS ON POVERTY ALLEVIATION AND RELIEF.  THE </p><p>DEPARTMENT WOULD FOCUS ON THREE AREAS, WITH AN INITIAL </p><p>EMPHASIS ON EMERGENCY RELIEF.  MOST OF HAMAS\' EFFORTS </p><p>OVER THE LAST 15 MONTHS HAVE BEEN IN THIS AREA, HE SAID, </p><p>INCLUDING THE PROVISION OF FOOD PACKAGES AND CASH TO THE </p><p>NEEDY.  FOR STARTERS, SHTAYYEH HOPED TO ASSIST FAMILIES </p><p>IN RAFAH WHOSE HOMES WERE DESTROYED LAST WEEK BY THE IDF. </p><p>THE ARAB LIBERATION FRONT (A MINOR PALESTINIAN POLITICAL </p><p>PARTY) HAD ALREADY BEEN IN RAFAH OVER THE LAST WEEK </p><p>DISTRIBUTING IRAQI MONEY TO AFFECTED FAMILIES, HE SAID. </p><p>ONE AREA WHERE HAMAS HAD BEEN QUITE EFFECTIVE FOR OVER A </p><p>DECADE WAS IN PROVIDING EMERGENCY HOUSING TO FAMILIES </p><p>WHOSE HOMES HAD BEEN DESTROYED, SHTAYYEH ADDED, AND HE </p><p>HOPED THAT PECDAR WOULD BE ABLE TO SUPPLANT SUCH </p><p>ASSISTANCE.  THERE WERE FAMILIES IN SOUTHERN GAZA WHO HAD </p><p>BEEN LIVING IN TENTS FOR FIVE OR SIX MONTHS, HE NOTED, </p><p>AND GIVEN FUNDING PECDAR COULD RENT APARTMENTS FOR THEM. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) SECONDLY, THE NEW PECDAR DEPARTMENT WOULD FOCUS </p><p>ON JOB CREATION VIA MICRO-PROJECTS.  THIS WOULD ENTAIL </p><p>OFFERING SMALL GRANTS OF UP TO $2000 TO NEEDY FAMILIES TO </p><p>HELP THEM, FOR EXAMPLE, TO BUY SEWING MACHINES OR FARM </p><p>ANIMALS TO INCREASE THEIR INCOMES.  OTHERS WOULD BE </p><p>PROVIDED TRAINING TO ENABLE THEM TO QUALIFY FOR SLIGHTLY </p><p>LARGER AMOUNTS VIA MICRO-LENDING PROGRAMS OFFERED BY </p><p>USAID AND THE PALESTINIAN DEVELOPMENT FUND.   THIRDLY, </p><p>PECDAR WOULD INITIATE A JOB PLACEMENT-SUBSIDY PROGRAM, </p><p>WHEREBY EMPLOYERS WOULD BE OFFERED A ONE-YEAR, 50 PERCENT </p><p>SUBSIDY ON THE SALARIES OF NEW EMPLOYEES. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HOW TO PUT HAMAS OUT OF THE CHARITY BUSINESS </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) SHTAYYEH ARGUED THAT, OVER THE LONG RUN, THE BEST </p><p>WAY TO BEAT HAMAS WAS NOT TO SHUT DOWN THEIR CHARITIES </p><p>BUT TO OUT-COMPETE THEM BY PROVIDING BETTER, ALTERNATIVE </p><p>SERVICES.  MOST PALESTINIANS ONLY TURNED TO HAMAS </p><p>SERVICES IF THERE WAS NO ALTERNATIVE, HE SAID, OBSERVING </p><p>THAT HAMAS WAS OPERATING KINDERGARTENS IN REMOTE AREAS </p><p>FOR PRECISELY THIS REASON.  AT THE SAME TIME, ANY DONOR- </p><p>FUNDED EFFORT TO SUPPLANT HAMAS SHOULD NOT BE PUBLICLY </p><p>DESCRIBED AS SUCH.  HAMAS CHARITIES SHOULD BE MADE </p><p>IRRELEVANT VIA A QUIET, APOLITICAL, LONG-TERM, SYSTEMATIC </p><p>PUBLIC WELFARE AND RELIEF EFFORT.  WHEN ECON CHIEF </p><p>SUGGESTED THAT HE CONSIDER A FUND-RAISING TOUR IN THE </p><p>GULF, SHTAYYEH AGREED, BUT STRESSED THAT IT SHOULD NOT BE </p><p>PUBLICLY BILLED AS AN ANTI-HAMAS EFFORT.  FOR ONE THING, </p><p>A FUND-RAISING EFFORT PUBLICLY IDENTIFIED WITH SUCH A </p><p>POLITICAL OBJECTIVE WOULD LIKELY INSPIRE LESS GENEROSITY </p><p>IN THE GULF THAN ONE THAT FOCUSED SIMPLY ON THE NEEDS. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) ECON CHIEF SPOKE SEPARATELY WITH NORWEGIAN </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE GEIR PEDERSEN WHO INDICATED NORWAY\'S </p><p>WILLINGNESS TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO PECDAR TO </p><p>HELP IT RETOOL FOR ITS NEW ROLE.  PEDERSEN SPOKE </p><p>SUBSEQUENTLY WITH SHTAYYEH, WHO WELCOMED THE OFFER. </p><p>PEDERSEN ENVISAGES THAT THE HAMAS GAP WILL BE A CENTRAL, </p><p>IF IMPLICIT, ISSUE AT THE AD HOC LIAISON COMMITTEE (AHLC) </p><p>MEETING PLANNED FOR EARLY MARCH, AND HE HAS URGED </p><p>SHTAYYEH TO PREPARE A PRESENTATION FOR THAT MEETING. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) DESPITE THE POTENTIAL TURF ISSUES OF WHICH </p><p>SHTAYYEH IS FULLY AWARE, WE ARE ENCOURAGED BY SHTAYYEH\'S </p><p>EFFORTS SO FAR AND REMAIN CONVINCED THAT PECDAR IS INDEED </p><p>THE BEST OPTION FOR REDIRECTING ARAB ASSISTANCE AWAY FROM </p><p>HAMAS CHARITIES.  PECDAR HAS A STRONG REPUTATION FOR </p><p>FINANCIAL TRANSPARENCY AND EFFECTIVENESS, AND HAS </p><p>SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED NUMEROUS PROJECTS FOR THE WORLD </p><p>BANK AND EUROPEAN DONORS.  IT IS NOT AN OFFICIAL PA </p><p>ENTITY, WHICH WILL LIKELY BE ADVANTAGE IN ATTRACTING </p><p>ASSISTANCE FROM GULF DONORS.  AT THE SAME TIME, SHTAYYEH </p><p>OPERATES IN THE PA ORBIT AND WILL IMPLEMENT THE PA LINE </p><p>AS HE DOES HIS BEST TO DRY UP THE MARKET FOR HAMAS </p><p>CHARITY.  HOWEVER, SHTAYYEH IS ALSO FAMED AS AN "EMPIRE </p><p>BUILDER" AND THE NORWEGIANS AND WE WILL HAVE TO WORK WITH </p><p>HIM TO DESIGN A PROGRAM THAT WORKS EFFECTIVELY AND </p><p>COLLEGIALLY WITH LEGITIMATE PALESTINIAN NGOS.  WE ALSO </p><p>TAKE SHTAYYEH\'S POINT THAT WE WILL PROBABLY MAKE HIS </p><p>FUNDRAISING AND IMPLEMENTATION JOB THAT MUCH MORE </p><p>DIFFICULT IF WE PAINT IT PUBLICLY AS A POLITICAL, ANTI- </p><p>HAMAS INITIATIVE -- BUT WE WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE IT CLEAR </p><p>TO SHTAYYEH THAT OUR POLICY IS THAT THE HAMAS </p><p>INSTITUTIONS MUST BE, AND REMAIN, CLOSED, NOT SLOWLY MADE </p><p>IRRELEVANT BY PECDAR\'S AND OTHER EFFORTS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SCHLICHER </p><p></p></div>
