<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 CARACAS 000539 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  02/09/08 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, VE </p><p>SUBJECT:  HUGO CHAVEZ CELEBRATES "DAY OF DIGNITY" </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) 97 CARACAS 4453  (B) CARACAS 254 (C)  CARACAS 265 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY THOMAS A. SHANNON, POLITICAL COUNSELOR. </p><p>REASONS 1.5(B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  FORMER COUP LEADER AND PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE HUGO CHAVEZ </p><p>CELEBRATED A "DAY OF DIGNITY" ON FEBRUARY 4 (4F), THE SIXTH </p><p>ANNIVERSARY OF HIS COUP ATTEMPT.  THIS CELEBRATION PROVIDED US AN </p><p>OPPORTUNITY TO OBSERVE CHAVEZ CAMPAIGNING AT THREE EVENTS:  MASS AT </p><p>THE NATIONAL CATHEDRAL, A WREATH LAYING AT THE STATUE OF NATIONAL </p><p>HERO SIMON BOLIVAR, AND A POLITICAL RALLY AT PLAZA CARACAS. </p><p>CHAVEZ, WHO HAD EARLIER CLAIMED HE WOULD DRAW 50,000, FOLLOWERS TO </p><p>THE PLAZA CARACAS DREW ONLY BETWEEN 5,000 AND 6,000 OF WHICH A MERE </p><p>1,000 TO 1,500 WERE AVID SUPPORTERS.  WHILE CHAVEZ CLEARLY APPEALS </p><p>TO SIGNIFICANT PORTIONS OF THE "MARGINAL" AND LOWER CLASSES, HE HAS </p><p>NOT DEMONSTRATED AN ABILITY SO FAR TO BROADEN HIS BASE OF SUPPORT. </p><p>BEGINNING ON THE DAY HE REGISTERED HIS PARTY, CHAVEZ LAID THE </p><p>GROUNDWORK FOR HIS "DAY OF DIGNITY" BY ORGANIZING A SERIES OF </p><p>RALLIES AND APPEARANCES IN AND AROUND CARACAS (REFTEL C).  CHAVEZ </p><p>FAILED TO CAPITALIZE ON THIS PREPARATORY WORK THOUGH, AND HAD </p><p>LITTLE NEW TO SAY.  INDEED, CHAVEZ\' CELEBRATION OF THE ANNIVERSARY </p><p>OF HIS COUP ATTEMPT IS REMARKABLE FOR HOW LITTLE NEWS IT GENERATED. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------------ </p><p>MASS AT THE NATIONAL CATHEDRAL AND A VISIT TO THE PLAZA BOLIVAR </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  CHAVEZ BEGAN HIS "DAY OF DIGNITY" WITH AN 11:00 A.M. </p><p>WREATH LAYING CEREMONY AT THE TOMB OF NATIONAL HERO SIMON BOLIVAR </p><p>AT THE NATIONAL PANTHEON.  AT 3:00 P.M., HE ATTENDED A MASS WITH </p><p>HIS SUPPORTERS AT THE NATIONAL CATHEDRAL WHICH IS LOCATED ON PLAZA </p><p>BOLIVAR.  POLOFF OBSERVED THAT THE CATHEDRAL WAS FILLED TO </p><p>CAPACITY.  AFTER MASS, CHAVEZ MOVED TO THE CENTER OF THE PLAZA TO </p><p>THE EQUESTRIAN STATUE OF SIMON BOLIVAR TO ADDRESS A CROWD OF ABOUT </p><p>1,500.  CHAVEZ CAMPAIGN WORKERS WERE VERY CAREFUL TO MAINTAIN PEACE </p><p>AND ORDER, AND USED BULLHORNS TO ASK THE CROWD TO REMAIN CALM AND </p><p>"RESPECTFUL ON THIS DAY OF DIGNITY."  AFTER LAYING A WREATH AT THE </p><p>BASE OF THE STATUE, CHAVEZ DECLARED THAT THE GOAL OF HIS CANDIDACY </p><p>IS TO ACHIEVE "A MORE PERFECT DEMOCRACY AND HAPPINESS FOR ALL." </p><p>CHAVEZ THEN CALLED FOR "RENOVATION AND REBIRTH TO (ENABLE) </p><p>VENEZUELA TO ACHIEVE THE GOALS OF BOLIVAR BY THE YEAR 2000."  HE </p><p>DID NOT ENUNCIATE WHAT THE GOALS OF BOLIVAR ARE.  CAMPAIGN SIGNS AT </p><p>THE PLAZA CARRIED THE SLOGAN "FOR A PATRIOTIC DEMOCRACY." </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>ONLY 5,000 TURN OUT FOR RALLY AT PLAZA CARACAS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  POLOFF AND PRESS REPORTS ESTIMATE THAT ABOUT 5,000 PEOPLE </p><p>ATTENDED CHAVEZ\' RALLY AT PLAZA CARACAS.  THE THEME OF THE RALLY </p><p>WAS "IT IS THE PEOPLE\'S TURN (LE TOCA AL PUEBLO)."  CHAVEZ HAD </p><p>EARLIER (REFTEL C) PROMISED THAT HE WOULD DRAW 50,000 PEOPLE TO </p><p>THIS RALLY WHICH WAS TO MARK THE COMPLETION OF SERIES OF RALLIES </p><p>HELD IN AND AROUND CARACAS OVER THE PREVIOUS THREE WEEKS.  POLOFF </p><p>ESTIMATES THAT ONLY 1,000 TO 1,500 OF THE PEOPLE PRESENT WERE </p><p>CONFIRMED CHAVEZ SUPPORTS.  MOST OF THESE SUPPORTERS WERE FROM THE </p><p>WORKING OR MARGINAL CLASSES, AND MANY WERE FROM OUTSIDE CARACAS. </p><p>MOST WHO ATTENDED THE RALLY WERE CURIOUS BY-STANDERS RATHER THAN </p><p>ACTIVE PARTICIPANTS IN THE RALLY, AND MANY ONLY PASSED BY DURING </p><p>RUSH HOUR ON THEIR WAY HOME FROM WORK. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  CHAVEZ SUPPORTERS MANNED TABLES IN THE SQUARE PASSING OUT </p><p>FIFTH REPUBLIC MOVEMENT(MVR) LITERATURE AND REGISTERING NEW PARTY </p><p>MEMBER.  REGISTRANTS WERE ASKED TO INDICATE WHICH "FRONT THEY </p><p>WOULD BE JOINING IN THE FIGHT TO "REJUVENAE VENEZUELA AND </p><p>VINDICATE THE DREAM OF BOLIVAR." EACH "FRONT" CORRESPONDS TO ONE </p><p>OF VENEZUELA\'S TATES.  NEW PARTY MEMBERS WERE ALSO ASSIGNED TO </p><p>DTACHMENTS TO MOBILIZE THE "ABSTAINERS" TO TURN OUTFOR CHAVEZ ON </p><p>ELECTION DAY.  PRIOR TO CHAVEZ\' ARIVAL, ANNOUNCERS CALLED FORTH </p><p>OFFICERS WHO PARTIIPATED IN CHAVEZ\' COUP ATTEMPT INDICATING THE </p><p>OBECTIVES SEIZED BY THE OFFICERS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  WHEN CHVEZ ARRIVED AT THE RALLY, HE BRIEFLY ACKNOWLEDGED </p><p>THE CROWD AND PROMPTLY PROCEEDED TO ASSEMBLE JOURALISTS AND </p><p>CAMERAMEN AROUND HIM.  AFTER ABOUT TWNTY MINUTES OBSERVING THE </p><p>BACKS OF CAMERAMEN, TH CROWD BEGAN TO WHISTLE AND CALL FOR CHAVEZ </p><p>TO ADRESS HIM.  CHAVEZ USHERED THE NEWSMEN AWAY, AND TUNED TOWARD </p><p>THE CROWD WHILE DONNING HIS SIGNATURERED BERET.  LIKE POLITICAL </p><p>RALLIES THE WORLD OVE, THERE WERE BANNERS, BALLOONS CORRESPONDING </p><p>TO HE COLORS OF THE FLAG, AND BABY KISSING -- EXCEPT HERE THE BABY </p><p>WORE CAMOUFLAGE. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>AND THE NEWS IS? -- NO NEWS </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  DURING HIS SPEECH, CHAVEZ FAILED TO CAPITALIZE ON THREE </p><p>WEEKS OF PREPARATORY WORK BY SEIZING THE OPPORTUNITY OF THIS </p><p>ANNIVERSARY TO MAKE ANY NEW PUBLIC STATEMENTS.  ONCE AGAIN, CHAVEZ </p><p>ASSERTED THAT HE DID NOT LAUNCH A COUP AGAINST DEMOCRACY SINCE </p><p>DEMOCRACY DOES NOT EXIST IN VENEZUELA.  CHAVEZ RECEIVED THE MOST </p><p>APPLAUSE FOR HIS OFT STATED REMARK THAT HE ACTED "AGAINST </p><p>CORRUPTOCRACY, AGAINST THE GENOCIDE OF [IMPEACHED PRESIDENT] CARLOS </p><p>ANDRES PEREZ."  CHAVEZ CONTINUED, "THE FOURTH OF FEBRUARY HAS NOT </p><p>DIED, AND NOW COMES ANOTHER BATTLE OF THE PEOPLE, THE ONE WHICH </p><p>WILL LIBERATE [THE NATION] -- THE SIXTH OF DECEMBER [ELECTION </p><p>DAY]."  COMMENTING THAT HE IS NOW "OPERATING ON THE ENEMY TERRAIN" </p><p>AGAINST THE DEMOCRATIC ACTION (AD), CHRISTIAN DEMOCRAT (COPEI), AND </p><p>MOVEMENT TOWARD SOCIALISM (MAS) PARTIES AND AGAINST FRONT-RUNNER </p><p>IRENE SAEZ, CHAVEZ SAID "THE WEAPONS [WE WILL USE ON ELECTION DAY] </p><p>ARE THE SAME:  THE POPULAR VOTE."  CHAVEZ ASSERTED THAT NINETY </p><p>PERCENT OF THE POPULATION SUPPORTED HIS COUP ATTEMPT.  CHAVEZ </p><p>CONTINUES TO CALL FOR THE DISSOLUTION OF THE "DO NOTHING" CONGRESS, </p><p>AND FOR THE CREATION OF A CONSTITUTIONAL CONGRESS (CONSTITUYENTE). </p><p>HE DID ADD THAT HE WOULD RENOUNCE THE PRESIDENCY IF THE PEOPLE DID </p><p>NOT SUPPORT HIS CALL FOR A CONSTITUTIONAL CONGRESS, SOMETHING </p><p>CHAVEZ CONSIDERS HIGHLY UNLIKELY. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  RATHER THAN COVERING THE RALLY DIRECTLY, THE CARACAS\' </p><p>LEADING DAILY "EL UNIVERSAL" CHOSE INSTEAD TO RUN A FULL PAGE </p><p>ARTICLE ENTITLED "CHAVISTAS COMMEMORATE THE COUP IGNORING THE </p><p>JUDGEMENTS AGAINST IT."  CHRISTIAN DEMOCRAT GUSTAVO TARRE BRICENO, </p><p>ASKING RHETORICALLY IF IT WAS NECESSARY FOR THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE TO </p><p>DIE IN THE COUP, ASKED "WOULD IT NOT HAVE BEEN BETTER IF CHAVEZ, </p><p>INSTEAD OF LAUNCHING A COUP, FOUNDED A PARTY INSTEAD?"  SOME </p><p>COMMENTATORS NOTED THAT THE COUP AWOKE VENEZUELA\'S POLITICAL </p><p>ESTABLISHMENT TO THE NEED FOR A NEW NATIONAL PROJECT AND FOR NEW </p><p>LEADERSHIP SO THAT COUPS COULD BE AVOIDED IN THE FUTURE. </p><p>HISTORIAN MANUEL CABALLERO COMMENTED, "IT APPEARS TO ME TO BE THE </p><p>HEIGHT OF CYNICISM THAT THE CHAVISTAS ARE CELEBRATING THE 4F </p><p>(FOURTH OF FEBRUARY) AS A DAY OF NATIONAL DIGNITY WHEN THE OPPOSITE </p><p>IS TRUE. . . .  [HE] IS A TRAITOR OF THE NATION (PATRIA). . . . </p><p>CHAVEZ IS CIVIL WAR."  OTHER CARACAS DAILIES RAN BRIEF ARTICLES </p><p>WHICH ESSENTIALLY NOTED THE EVENT. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>27N TO SUPPORT CHAVEZ? </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U)  THE CARACAS DAILY "EL GLOBO" INTERVIEWED A PARTICIPANT IN </p><p>THE FAILED NOVEMBER 27, 1992 COUP ATTEMPT, REAR ADMIRAL LUIS </p><p>CABRERA AGUIRRE, REGARDING THE POSSIBILITY THAT PARTICIPANTS IN THE </p><p>27N WOULD SUPPORT CHAVEZ.  CABRERA, WHO WAS PRESENT AT THE RALLY, </p><p>SAID TO "EL GLOBO," "WE HOPE TO ESTABLISH A BLOCK OF OPINION, NOT </p><p>A POLITICAL PARTY, THAT IS INTENDED TO INFORM ALL OF THE VISION OF </p><p>THE COUNTRY THAT WE HAVE." </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  CHAVEZ\'S FAILURE TO GENERATE LARGE CROWDS FOR HIS "DAY OF </p><p>DIGNITY" INDICATES THAT HIS PARTY IS HAVING PROBLEMS MOBILIZING </p><p>SUPPORTERS.  HOWEVER, THESE PROBLEMS DID NOT UNDERMINE HIS CENTRAL </p><p>PURPOSE:  TO WIN PUBLICITY.  BY CHOOSING RELATIVELY SMALL LOCATIONS </p><p>FOR HIS THREE EVENTS -- THE CATHEDRAL, PLAZA BOLIVAR, AND PLAZA </p><p>CARACAS -- EACH EVENT APPEARED ON CAMERA TO BE WELL ATTENDED. </p><p>RECENT POLLIN SHOWS THAT CHAVEZ HAS PUSHED HIS POPULARITY LEVEL TO </p><p>11 PERCENT, PUTTING HIM IN SECOND PLACE BEHIND IRENE SAEZ.  WITH </p><p>THE MAJOR PARTIES YET TO IDENTIFY THEIR CANDIDATES, THE PRESS HAS </p><p>FOCUSED ON SAEZ AND CHAVEZ AS THE CENTRAL PERSONALITIES OF THE </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN, AND REFERS TO THEM AS THE "THE BEAUTY AND </p><p>THE BEAST." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MAISTO </p><p></p></div>
