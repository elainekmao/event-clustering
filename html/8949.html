<p>S E C R E T ANKARA 004032 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/24/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PREL, TU, IR, AJ, EZ </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKS AGREE TO FACILITATE TRAVEL WHEN POSSIBLE </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) STATE 179144 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by DCM Robert S. Deutsch.  Reason: 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (S)  Embassy confirmed with Turkish officials that they </p><p>remain willing to ensure the two journalists will be able to </p><p>transit Turkey as they travel to Prague when a new itinerary </p><p>is developed.  GOT officials asked that their participation </p><p>be kept confidential. During preparations for transit on June </p><p>24, GOT officials requested that an official from the </p><p>Consulate in Istanbul not participate in the transit to </p><p>minimize the possibility of drawing attention to the </p><p>travelers.  Separately, we had arranged with airport </p><p>officials for permission to enter secured areas. A ConGen </p><p>Istanbul official was going to be on the scene to confirm </p><p>successful transit but maintaining a low profile so GOT </p><p>officials would not upset. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (S)  DCM spoke with the Deputy Director General for Middle </p><p>Eastern Affairs Burcuoglu who personally conveyed the GOT\'s </p><p>desire to be helpful in this matter.  He stressed that </p><p>Turkish involvement must not become known publicly.  The Iran </p><p>desk, responsible for actual coordination of the transit also </p><p>repeated that they remain willing and able to assist with the </p><p>transit when a new itinerary is developed.  They are prepared </p><p>to send written instructions to their Embassy in Baku. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) Embassy is coordinating changes in travel plans with </p><p>ConGen Istanbul and will ensure an official is at the airport </p><p>during any transit. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  Point of contact in Ankara remains Consul Laura </p><p>Dogu.  She can be reached through the Embassy switchboard at </p><p>any time.  90-312-455-5555. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
