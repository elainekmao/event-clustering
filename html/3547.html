Summary:  Arrests of farmers by the Zimbabwean authorities </p><p>continue, with no break in the official party rationale and </p><p>no indication of respite.  Most farmers are being released on </p><p>bail an receiving future court dates.  There is little </p><p>consistency throughout the various regions as to the </p><p>conditions attached to the farmers\' release, with some being </p><p>ordered to vacate the property immediately, some being given </p><p>2-3 days, and some being given to the end of August.  End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  According to reports published by the group Justice for </p><p>Agriculture (JAG), over 196 identified farmers had been </p><p>arrested as of August 20.  In several cases, contrary to </p><p>published reports of farmers "going into hiding" and forcing </p><p>the police to hunt them down, farmers whose land is not even </p><p>subject to the final Section 8 acquisition orders have </p><p>voluntarily presented themselves at police stations in </p><p>solidarity with their colleagues and in order to clarify </p><p>their legal status. </p><p> </p><p>3. In another break with reality, the government-controlled </p><p>Herald has reported that one farmer attempted to "kill cops" </p><p>in a plot which backfired.  According to a farming source in </p><p>the area, however, the farmer -- Ian Barker -- was working in </p><p>his fields when he received reports that his elderly mother </p><p>was being arrested and hauled off from his homestead in a </p><p>police vehicle.  Barker reportedly jumped into his own </p><p>vehicle and went speeding off to try and reason with the </p><p>arresting authorities.  When Barker rounded a blind curve and </p><p>came upon the police convoy, which was driving along the </p><p>gravel road, he slammed on his brakes, causing his vehicle to </p><p>lock up and skid to a halt about one meter from the police </p><p>vehicle.  Due to the presence of the District Administrator </p><p>and two war vets in the convoy, the police immediately </p><p>arrested Barker on charges of four counts of attempted </p><p>murder, since  four police officers were riding in the other </p><p>vehicle.  As an indication of the "seriousness" of this </p><p>offense, Barker was subsequently released on Zim $5000 bail </p><p>(about US $7.25 at parallel market rates), the same bail </p><p>granted to other farmers in the area. </p><p> </p><p>4. The majority of farmers have been released on bail with </p><p>the terms of their release varying according to the region in </p><p>which they live.  Farmers in some regions, including </p><p>Masvingo, were released on Zim $5000 bail and given 2-3 days </p><p>to leave their property.  Farmers in other regions, including </p><p>Mashonaland Central, were released on Zim $5000 bail and </p><p>given until August 30 to vacate their farms.  Farmers in yet </p><p>other regions, including  Mashonaland Central, were released </p><p>on Zim $10,000 bail and given 24 hours to vacate their </p><p>properties.  Some farmers were prohibited from returning to </p><p>their farms altogether, others were allowed to visit their </p><p>farms only with a police escort, and still others were </p><p>allowed to attend to their farming chores during the day but </p><p>were not allowed to spend the night in their homes.  Some </p><p>farmers had all charges dropped because of technicalities </p><p>which rendered their Section 8 orders invalid or because the </p><p>90-day period in which they must vacate their properties had </p><p>not yet expired.  Several farmers, including a 67-year-old </p><p>farmer in ill health who was assaulted while in police </p><p>custody, have been denied bail and will be kept in custody </p><p>until their respective hearing dates.  As expected, the </p><p>conditions vary according to the political personalities in </p><p>control of the various provinces. </p><p> </p><p>5. In one region, a farming contact reports that all farmers </p><p>arrested are required to appear before a "board" consisting </p><p>of two police Internal Security personnel, two Central </p><p>Intelligence Organization (CIO) personnel, and two war vets. </p><p>The farmers have reportedly all been asked how much they are </p><p>prepared to downsize their current operations.  In one case, </p><p>a farmer who has only received a Section 5, or preliminary </p><p>notice of acquisition, has been ordered to turn over his </p><p>title deed and one-half of his 800 hectare operation, after </p><p>which he would receive some as-yet undetermined document </p><p>confirming his ownership of the remaining portion.  The </p><p>farming contact reports that the authorities seem to be </p><p>"shaking the tree to see what will fall." </p><p> </p><p>6. Comment: In a not-too-surprising development, Colin </p><p>Cloete, president of the Commercial Farmers\' Union (CFU), was </p><p>also arrested.  Several farming contacts have reported that </p><p>the CFU is no longer perceived by its constituents as a </p><p>viable advocacy group, but that it has now taken on the role </p><p>of simply another "professional organization."  The arrest of </p><p>Cloete is indicative of the disregard in which the group is </p><p>held by the GOZ, and also seems to close the door on any </p><p>attempt to revive the moribund Zimbabwe Joint Resettlement </p><p>Initiative (ZJRI), in which the CFU attempted to work with </p><p>the GOZ in identifying and ceding commercial farmland for </p><p>resettlement.  The GOZ\'s actions seem to confirm the JAG\'s </p><p>assertions that you cannot negotiate with the government, and </p><p>that the CFU\'s attempts to extricate its members from this </p><p>situation via dialogue were doomed to failure.  We expect </p><p>these arrests to continue, but the next major challenge </p><p>concerns how the courts deal with the actual merits of each </p><p>case.  Some farmers whose Section 8 notices have been </p><p>overturned on technicalities expect an immediate re-issue of </p><p>the notices with scrupulous attention to the letter of the </p><p>law.  Of course, in the end, the Mugabe government may not </p><p>even acknowledge the magistrates\' actions, and ultimately it </p><p>can simply ignore any judicial decisions with which it does </p><p>not agree, as it has done in the past.  End comment. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
