<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 BEIRUT 000758 </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR SUTPHIN, PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:DECL:03/22/11 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, KISL, IR, LE </p><p>SUBJECT:  HIZBALLAH-AMAL FORGE MUNICIPAL ELECTION </p><p>ALLIANCE - COURTESY OF SYRIA </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) BEIRUT 136, B) 00 BEIRUT 4295 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY CHARGE DAVID HALE.  REASON 1.5 B&D. </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY:  PARLIAMENTARY SPEAKER/AMAL MOVEMENT </p><p>HEAD NABIH BERRI, CORNERED BY SYRIAN SUPPORT FOR </p><p>HARIRI\'S STRUCTURAL REFORMS WHICH WILL HARM HIS </p><p>PATRONAGE MACHINE, IS TRIMMING SAILS.  HE HAS MET WITH </p><p>ARCH-RIVAL HIZBALLAH SYG NASRALLAH AND COMPROMISES ON </p><p>TWO BONES OF CONTENTION ARE EMERGING.  FIRST, THEY </p><p>HAVE CUT A DEAL IN WHICH A PRO-AMAL FIGURE BECOMES THE </p><p>HEAD OF THE HIGHER ISLAMIC SHI\'A COUNCIL (SPIRITUAL </p><p>LEADER OF THE COMMUNITY AND CONTROLLER OF CLERICAL </p><p>APPOINTMENTS AND FUNDS) WHILE A PRO-HIZBALLAHI GAINS </p><p>THE DEPUTY SLOT.  SECOND, THEY HAVE WORKED OUT </p><p>DIFFERENCES BLOCKING MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS IN THE FORMER </p><p>ISRAELI SECURITY ZONE, AND WILL FORGE A MADE-IN-SYRIA </p><p>ALLIANCE WHICH WILL BLOCK OUT ANY THIRD FORCES, SUCH </p><p>AS FORMER SPEAKER KAMAL AL-ASAD.  THESE COMPROMISES IN </p><p>PART REFLECT BERRI\'S SENSE OF POLITICAL VULNERABILITY, </p><p>BUT ALSO A SIGN THAT HIZBALLAH IS COMING BACK DOWN TO </p><p>EARTH AFTER THE HEADY POST-LIBERATION DAYS. </p><p>NASRALLAH\'S ASSOCIATION WITH THE PALESTINIAN INTIFADA </p><p>-- WHILE IT HAS PUT HIM ON THE MAP REGIONALLY -- HAS </p><p>GAINED THE PARTY LITTLE IN THE DEEPLY ANTI-PALESTINIAN </p><p>SHI\'A COMMUNITY.  THE RESULT IS A TEMPORARY, TACTICAL </p><p>ALLIANCE WHICH WILL NOT CHANGE THE LANDSCAPE IN THE </p><p>SOUTH, BUT MAY REDUCE INTERNAL SHI\'A TENSIONS FOR THE </p><p>MOMENT.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) PARLIAMENTARY SPEAKER/AMAL MOVEMENT HEAD NABIH </p><p>BERRI HAS BEEN ON THE POLITICAL DEFENSIVE.  MOST </p><p>RECENTLY, HE HAS BEEN COMPELLED TO ACCEPT POTENTIALLY </p><p>SWEEPING STRUCTURAL REFORMS ADVOCATED BY PM HARIRI </p><p>WHICH WILL UNDERCUT A MAJOR SOURCE OF HIS POWER, </p><p>PATRONAGE.  THE GOVERNMENT JOBS OF THOUSANDS OF HIS </p><p>FOLLOWERS ARE ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK -- ALBEIT </p><p>INCUMBENTS WILL GET GOLDEN HANDSHAKES -- AS THE PRICE </p><p>HARIRI HAS SAID MUST BE PAID TO RESTORE CONFIDENCE IN </p><p>LEBANON\'S ECONOMY AND FINANCES.  BERRI\'S CLIMBDOWN IS </p><p>GENERALLY ATTRIBUTED TO PRESSURE FROM DAMASCUS, WHOSE </p><p>LOCAL OPERATIVES HAVE BEEN VISIBLE SUPPORTERS OF </p><p>HARIRI\'S REFORM AGENDA. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) AN UNUSUAL MEETING BETWEEN BERRI AND HIZBALLAH </p><p>SECGEN NASRALLAH MAY REFLECT BERRI\'S RESPONSE TO HIS </p><p>REDUCED CIRCUMSTANCES.  IT IS SAID THAT TWO </p><p>COMPROMISES EMERGED ON ISSUES DIVIDING AMAL AND </p><p>HIZBALLAH AND THE SHI\'A COMMUNITY:  THE SUCCESSION TO </p><p>IMAM MUHAMMAD MAHDI SHAMS AD-DIN, WHO DIED IN JANUARY, </p><p>AND ORGANIZATION OF MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS IN THE FORMER </p><p>ISRAELI SECURITY ZONE. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) SHAMS AD-DIN\'S POSITION AS SHI\'A SPIRITUAL </p><p>LEADER AND HEAD OF THE HIGHER ISLAMIC SHI\'A COUNCIL </p><p>(HISC) HAS BEEN FILLED BY HIS DEPUTY, AS ACTING </p><p>CHAIRMAN, ABDEL AMIR QABALAN.  QABALAN IS A PRO-AMAL </p><p>CLERIC WITH LITTLE NATIONAL FOLLOWING OR RESPECT </p><p>(REFTEL).  ACCORDING TO A TOP HISC ADVISOR, BERRI AND </p><p>NASRALLAH AGREED THAT QABALAN SHOULD BE ELECTED </p><p>CHAIRMAN, AND A NEW, PRO-HIZBALLAH DEPUTY APPOINTED TO </p><p>FILL QABALAN\'S POSITION -- AND BE POSITIONED TO BECOME </p><p>CHAIRMAN WHENEVER QABALAN PASSES FROM THE SCENE. </p><p>HIZBALLAH\'S CANDIDATE IS SHEIKH MOHAMED YAZBEK, THE </p><p>LOCAL "PERSONAL" REPRESENTATIVE OF AYATOLLAH KHAMENEI </p><p>(ALTHOUGH IRANIAN FM KHARRAZI WAS SAID DURING HIS </p><p>VISIT LAST WEEK TO HAVE SAID TEHRAN FAVORED ANY </p><p>CANDIDATE WHO GAINED CONSENSUS SUPPORT FROM AMAL AND </p><p>HIZBALLAH.  AMAL IS STILL PUBLICLY SUPPORTING A RIVAL </p><p>CANDIDATE, BAALBAK MUFTI KHALIL SHUQAIR, BUT A KEY </p><p>CONTACT SAID THE DEAL HAS BEEN CUT FAVORING YAZBEK. </p><p>THESE APPOINTMENTS MATTER BECAUSE OF HISC\'S CONTROL </p><p>OVER ALL SHI\'A CLERICAL APPOINTMENTS AS WELL THE </p><p>RELIGIOUS ENDOWMENTS, ISLAMIC UNIVERSITY, AND AZ-ZAHRA </p><p>HOSPITAL.  IN THE PAST, HIZBALLAH OFFICIALS WERE </p><p>DISMISSIVE THE OF THE COUNCIL, AND RELIED ON THEIR OWN </p><p>ASSETS TO PROMOTE SUPPORT.  HOWEVER, LOOKING TO THE </p><p>DAY OF REDUCED IRANIAN SUPPORT, HIZBALLAH FIGURES MAY </p><p>NOW FIND ACCESS TO HISC PATRONAGE AND MONEY MORE </p><p>ATTRACTIVE. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) THE SECOND COMPROMISE INVOLVED AGREEMENT ON </p><p>PROCEEDING WITH MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS IN THE FORMER </p><p>SECURITY ZONE, WHICH WILL BE THE FIRST SINCE 1963. </p><p>THEIR CONSENSUS, BASED ON A MADE-IN-SYRIA ELECTORAL </p><p>ALLIANCE BETWEEN THE TWO PARTIES, CLEARS THE WAY FOR </p><p>SEPTEMBER POLLS.  THE TWO PARTIES\' DIVISION OF THE </p><p>SPOILS WITH AGREED LISTS OF PRE-CHOSEN CANDIDATES WILL </p><p>ENSURE A MINIMUM OF SURPRISES, AS WELL AS MINIMAL </p><p>LOCAL CONFLICT BETWEEN ARMED SUPPORTERS.  KEY WILL BE </p><p>TO SHUT OUT THIRD FORCE COMPETITORS, SUCH AS FORMER </p><p>SPEAKER KAMAL AL-ASAD, WHO IS ANATHEMA IN DAMASCUS BUT </p><p>RETAINS A CONSIDERABLE CORE OF SUPPORT IN THE FORMER </p><p>ZONE. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) KHIAM MP/AMAL MEMBER ALI HASSAN KHALIL </p><p>CHARACTERIZED TO US THE UPCOMING MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS </p><p>AS CRUCIAL FOR THE POLITICAL FUTURE OF THE REGION </p><p>AFTER ALMOST A QUARTER-CENTURY OF ARTIFICIAL, </p><p>EXTERNALLY-IMPOSED POLITICS.  THE MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS </p><p>WOULD PREVIEW ANY NEW POLITICAL BLOOD THAT MAY COME TO </p><p>THE FOREFRONT.  HOPING TO NIP THAT INDEPENDENT STRAIN </p><p>IN THE BUD, DAMASCUS HAS ENCOURAGED BOTH SHIA PARTIES </p><p>TO "COORDINATE" THEIR ELECTION STRATEGIES AND </p><p>CANDIDATE LISTS.  TO DATE, KHALIL HAS HELD SOME SIX </p><p>MEETINGS WITH HIZBALLAH POLITICAL ADVISOR, HUSSEIN </p><p>KHALIL.  WHILE THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE CONSENSUS ON ANY </p><p>ISSUE, DAMASCUS WILL ENSURE THAT A UNIFIED POSITION </p><p>WILL ARISE COME ELECTION DAY. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) DESPITE THE FIERCE RIVALRY BETWEEN THE TWO </p><p>PARTIES, BOTH AMAL NOR HIZBALLAH GAIN IN THIS </p><p>COALITION.  AMAL IS A HOLLOWED OUT PARTY, STRIPPED OF </p><p>ITS CIVIL WAR ERA LEGITIMACY BY POST-WAR CORRUPTION. </p><p>WHILE ITS LONG POLITICAL EXPERIENCE AND SECULAR </p><p>APPROACH REMAIN ATTRACTIVE DRAWS TO THE SHIA </p><p>COMMUNITY, PATRONAGE HAS BEEN KEY TO BERRI\'S SUCCESS - </p><p>- AND HARIRI\'S REFORMS ARE AT LEAST TEMPORARILY </p><p>DILUTING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THAT WEAPON FOR HIM. </p><p>HIZBALLAH, ON THE DOWNSWING FROM THE HEADY DAYS OF THE </p><p>ISRAELI WITHDRAWAL, IS SAID TO HAVE ENCOUNTERED SOME </p><p>CRITICISM FROM SOUTHERNERS, WHO DISAGREE WITH THE </p><p>PARTY\'S ADVOCACY OF THE PALESTINIAN INTIFADA, </p><p>UNWILLING TO GET DRAWN BACK INTO VIOLENCE WITH ISRAEL </p><p>ON BEHALF OF UNPOPULAR PALESTINIANS.  VOICES ARE ALSO </p><p>HEARD SAYING THAT HIZBALLAH HAS FAILED TO FILL THE </p><p>SERVICE VACUUM LEFT BY THE STATE, AND HAVE SHOWN TO BE </p><p>NO BETTER THAN OTHER LEBANESE POLITICAL FORCES WHICH </p><p>FAIL TO DELIVER. </p><p> </p><p>HALE </p><p></p></div>
