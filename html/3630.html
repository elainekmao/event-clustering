Jeter; Reasons 1.5(B) </p><p>and (D) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) I managed to reach ECOWAS Executive Secretary </p><p>Mohammed Chambas before he left Sweden on August 31. </p><p>Chambas will be traveling in Europe for the rest of this </p><p>week and returns to Abuja over the weekend. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) The Executive Secretary confirms that ECOWAS is </p><p>proposing a meeting of the Liberia Contact Group on </p><p>September 17, at UN Headquarters in New York. (Chambas was </p><p>not aware that Burkina Faso might also be calling for a </p><p>meeting of the Contact Group). Presidents Wade and Obasanjo </p><p>will both be in New York on September 16 for a meeting on </p><p>NEPAD, and Chambas hopes that both will stay over for the </p><p>CG meeting on the 17th.  Chambas said that the UN should </p><p>call the meeting, and his hope is that the UNSYG will </p><p>personally convene it. (Chambas said that he has spoken </p><p>with A/SYG Turk, who is in favor of the idea). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Chambas has concluded that the Contact Group </p><p>should be small. Compositions should include the UN, </p><p>ECOWAS, Senegal, Nigeria, the African Union, the U.S., </p><p>France, and the EU, represented by Special Representative </p><p>Hans Dahlgren. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Jack Straw, the British Foreign Secretary, was </p><p>attending the same meeting in Sweden as Chambas.  The two </p><p>discussed the proposed 9/17 Contact Group meeting, and the </p><p>Foreign Secretary thought it was a useful idea.  Straw said </p><p>that London would urge the Secretary General to convene the </p><p>CG meeting. Chambas said that it would be very helpful if </p><p>Washington would also indicate its support to the Office of </p><p>the Secretary General. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
