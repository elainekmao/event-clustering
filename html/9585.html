<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 001247 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/15/13 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MASS, MOPS, PHUM, NI, LI </p><p>SUBJECT: ECOWAS EXSEC CHAMBAS DISCUSSES NEXT STEPS ON </p><p>LIBERIA WITH A/S KANSTEINER </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By Ambassador Howard F. Jeter. Reasons 1.5 </p><p>(B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary.  In a July 12 side-bar meeting during </p><p>President Bush\'s visit to Nigeria, A/S Kansteiner told </p><p>ECOWAS Executive Secretary Chambas that the United </p><p>States was still considering its policy options in </p><p>Liberia.  Chambas asserted United States troops were </p><p>essential to the success of a stabilization force.  He </p><p>added that ECOWAS leaders had agreed to deploy a 1,150 </p><p>"vanguard" quickly to Monrovia.  Chambas\' timetable </p><p>for establishing a transitional government was for </p><p>Taylor to relinquish the Presidency by August 5, with </p><p>Vice President Blah presiding until October, then </p><p>handing over to a transitional government mandated to </p><p>hold elections by October 2004.  Most likely, the </p><p>transitional formula would be a power-sharing </p><p>arrangement with remnants of the GOL, the LURD, MODEL, </p><p>and major political parties participating.  At the </p><p>meeting, Chambas was accompanied by his Information </p><p>Officer and two Special Assistants.  Kansteiner was </p><p>joined by Special Assistant Jim Dunlap, NSC Director </p><p>Bobby Pittman and Abuja\'s A/DCM.  End Summary </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>The USG: Seriously Vetting The Options </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) During a July 12 morning meeting at the </p><p>Ambassador\'s residence, A/S Kansteiner told ECOWAS </p><p>Executive Secretary Mohammed Ibn Chambas that the USG </p><p>was still considering the full range of options for </p><p>Liberia.  Kansteiner elaborated that those options </p><p>ranged from provision of only financial support, to a </p><p>mixture of financial and logistical assistance, to the </p><p>possible deployment of American troops on Liberian </p><p>soil.  A/S Kansteiner emphasized that a decision had </p><p>not been made.  One of the reasons President Bush </p><p>embarked on the trip to Africa was to hear from the </p><p>continent\'s leaders on the subject of Liberia and to </p><p>listen to their views on the possible introduction of </p><p>U.S. troops there, Kansteiner said.  Kansteiner asked </p><p>Chambas about the ECOWAS plan for troop deployment to </p><p>Liberia. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Chambas responded that President Obasanjo met </p><p>Ghana\'s Kufuor and Mali\'s Toure, who were joined by </p><p>several West Africa Foreign Ministers, on the margins </p><p>of the AU Summit in Maputo.  The three Presidents </p><p>agreed to the rapid deployment of 1,050 troops </p><p>(Nigeria - 750, Ghana - 250, Mali - 150) no later than </p><p>July 28.  This first deployment would subsequently be </p><p>augmented by a total number of approximately 3,000 </p><p>ECOWAS troops.  Chambas added that President Obasanjo </p><p>had named a Nigerian Brigadier General to command the </p><p>force and Mali was being asked to supply the Deputy </p><p>Commander.  Chambas emphasized that the Heads of State </p><p>had concluded that a quick deployment was essential to </p><p>avoid giving Taylor a pretext for remaining.  However, </p><p>he feared a small force not backed by U.S. muscle, </p><p>might not have the necessary coercive influence. </p><p>Taylor or one of the other groups might test them. </p><p>However, a U.S. presence, with all of its military and </p><p>logistical capabilities, would convince Taylor that </p><p>his era had ended, Chambas maintained. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Assuming U.S. troops would deploy, Kansteiner </p><p>asked how large an American deployment did ECOWAS </p><p>envision.  How may U.S. troops would it take to </p><p>convince Taylor and the LURD to cease and desist, </p><p>Kansteiner asked?  Chambas answered that one thousand </p><p>American troops, particularly with a "vessel on the </p><p>horizon," would have a sufficient sobering effect on </p><p>Taylor and the LURD.  The full contingent would not </p><p>have to remain throughout the exercise.  Within two or </p><p>three weeks, roughly half could be withdrawn, Chambas </p><p>posited.  Regarding other help the ECOWAS deployment </p><p>would need, Chambas stated that per diem, airlift, </p><p>logistical and equipment assistance would be needed </p><p>for most troop contributing states.  He was unsure </p><p>whether Nigeria would need lift assistance or could </p><p>use their own C-130 transport. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>Timing is Important </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) A/S Kansteiner mentioned that the ECOWAS </p><p>sequence calling for troop deployment a week before </p><p>Taylor\'s exit was problematic.  He underscored that </p><p>any U.S. deployment was contingent on Taylor\'s prior </p><p>departure.  We have said publicly that we will not </p><p>send troops while Taylor remained in Liberia, </p><p>Kansteiner affirmed. Noting the USG concern, Chambas </p><p>acknowledged the ECOWAS scenario contemplated troop </p><p>deployment before Taylor\'s departure.  He briefly </p><p>raised the possibility of ECOWAS deploying first, </p><p>followed by an American deployment after Taylor </p><p>departed.  However, he quickly scotched that idea, </p><p>stating the importance to Taylor and the Liberia </p><p>people of simultaneity in the ECOWAS and American </p><p>deployments.  Kansteiner mentioned that President Bush </p><p>would discuss the sequencing of the possible U.S. </p><p>deployment with President Obasanjo; maybe a way to </p><p>finesse this dilemna would be to fashion the </p><p>simultaneous Taylor departure and U.S. troop </p><p>deployment.  For instance, a MEU could anchor off the </p><p>coast as Taylor relinquished power on his way to the </p><p>airport.  Upon Taylor\'s departure, U.S. troops would </p><p>land immediately. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Kansteiner raised concern about LURD statements </p><p>that it would fight American or any other peacekeepers </p><p>if deployed prior to Taylor\'s departure.  In part </p><p>Chambas discounted the LURD statement as braggadoccio. </p><p>However, he also felt this grew out of a concern that </p><p>Taylor would footdrag once peacekeepers were deployed </p><p>and attempt to use the peacekeepers as his defensive </p><p>shield.  Chambas stated that it was important to talk </p><p>to the LURD to allay these fears.  It was equally </p><p>important that the troops deploy in a manner rendering </p><p>it difficult for Taylor to be desultory.  Chambas </p><p>added that President Obasanjo planned to visit Conakry </p><p>on July 13 to discuss Liberia with President Conte. </p><p>(Comment: Reading between the lines, we believe </p><p>Obasanjo visited Conakry to persuade President Conte </p><p>to influence the LURD to behave responsibly.  End </p><p>Comment). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>What Manner of Government </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Chambas asserted that ECOWAS leaders were </p><p>preoccupied with maintaining as much of a </p><p>constitutional semblance as possible in the hand-over </p><p>of power.  The Heads of States did not want to discard </p><p>the constitution completely; they did not want to set </p><p>too liberal a precedent.  Consequently, Chambas had </p><p>identified August 5 as the appropriate date for Taylor </p><p>to relinquish power.  Taylor was inaugurated August 6, </p><p>1997; August 5 would be the last day of his </p><p>constitutionally mandated six-year term. </p><p>Additionally, the ECOWAS leaders believed Taylor </p><p>should pass the baton to Vice-President Blah in </p><p>consonance with constitutional succession provisions. </p><p>Chambas stated that Taylor was toying with the idea of </p><p>replacing Blah with House Speaker Sando Johnson or </p><p>Planning Minister Roland Massaquoi, both long-time </p><p>loyalists, so that either one could succeed him.  LURD </p><p>would be uneasy whether Blah or either of the other </p><p>two became temporary Head of State; the LURD would </p><p>suspect that Taylor was still piloting the Liberian </p><p>ship, albeit by proxy, Chambas offered.  A/S </p><p>Kansteiner underlined that the period for Blah to hold </p><p>power should be brief.  This would seem to lessen the </p><p>LURD\'s and others\' misgivings. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Chambas reiterated that the transnational </p><p>government should be established by October.  The </p><p>government\'s lifespan would be one year; its mandate </p><p>would be to reestablish basic government services and </p><p>to establish conditions to hold elections the </p><p>following October.  The date would be in keeping with </p><p>the Liberia political custom of holding elections that </p><p>month.  Chambas stated the ideal transitional </p><p>government would be composed exclusively of </p><p>technocrats with no political ambitions.  However, the </p><p>reality was that there were few Liberians who fit that </p><p>neutral description.  Moreover, LURD, and MODEL would </p><p>balk at a government of technocrats because they would </p><p>be shut out.  Instead, the most likely approach would </p><p>be that whoever succeeds Taylor must make a public </p><p>commitment to turn over to the transitional government </p><p>and not contest in the 2004 elections.  Then a </p><p>government of national unity, including LURD, MODEL, </p><p>GOL remnants and representatives of the major </p><p>political parties, would be formed.  Participants in </p><p>the transitional government would be prohibited from </p><p>participating in the 2004 elections. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Although factional involvement in the </p><p>transitional government might be close to a fait </p><p>accompli, factional participation should be </p><p>conditioned on performance on disarmament, Chambas and </p><p>Kansteiner agreed.  Factions should not be allowed to </p><p>assume their portfolios until achieving noticeable </p><p>progress on disarmament.  Additionally, the factions </p><p>should not be given control of the security, financial </p><p>matters, or access to state revenue. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>Domestic Opposition to Obasanjo </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Chambas and A/S Kansteiner noted that </p><p>President Obasanjo faced noticeable domestic </p><p>opposition in Nigeria to his asylum offer to Taylor. </p><p>Human right groups and others had castigated the </p><p>decision.  Kansteiner stated that the indictment </p><p>against Taylor was more than justified; however, for </p><p>the sake of peace in Liberia, the United States </p><p>Government and would not criticize Obasanjo for </p><p>offering a haven to Taylor in the interest of peace in </p><p>Liberia. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p>10. (C) The sub-regional call for American troop </p><p>deployment is loud and it is clear.  The expectation </p><p>is high.  However, the decision to send American </p><p>troops, if it is made, will not be a panacea.  We will </p><p>still have to work out sticky issues such as timing of </p><p>Taylor departure, help for ECOWAS troop contingents </p><p>and the establishment of the transitional government. </p><p>The more assistance we provide, particularly if that </p><p>assistance comes in the form of troops, the more </p><p>leverage we will have to influence the resolution of </p><p>these other issues and the direction the peace process </p><p>will take. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
