Amman-based Regional English Language Office </p><p>     (RELO) would like to nominate the following nominees: </p><p>     Ms. Shireen Bawab from East Jerusalem, Mr. Abdul Bari </p><p>     Muhajer from Aleppo, and Ms. Samia Abou Hamad from </p><p>     Beirut to attend the TESOL 2003 convention in </p><p>     Baltimore, Maryland, March 24-30, 2003. </p><p> </p><p>2.   MS. SHIREEN BAWAB - EAST JERUSALEM. Ms. Bawab is </p><p>     one of the leading English as a Second Language (ESL) </p><p>     professional in East Jerusalem. Because of the unique </p><p>     situation of schools in East Jerusalem, Ms. Bawab works </p><p>     closely with Arab sector of Israeli Ministry of </p><p>     Education and the PA Ministry of Education. The Public </p><p>     Affairs sections of both Tel Aviv and Jerusalem support </p><p>     her nomination.  Ms. Bawab has extensive knowledge and </p><p>     experience in teacher preparation (pre-service) and </p><p>     teacher development (in-service) and teacher mentoring </p><p>     at David Yellin College of Education and the Hebrew </p><p>     University.  In addition, she has participated in </p><p>     research projects in English language teaching </p><p>     innovation, assessment and evaluation and the use of </p><p>     new technologies at Bethlehem University.  In addition </p><p>     to her 20 years of ESL experience, she has also taught </p><p>     history and music and coordinated special events at the </p><p>     College des Freres in East Jerusalem. </p><p> </p><p>3.   MR. ABDUL BRAI MUHAMMAD MUHAJER MEEN - SYRIA. Mr. </p><p>     Muhajer is a senior inspector in the Directorate of </p><p>     Education, Ministry of Education, Aleppo, Syria to </p><p>     attend the TESOL 2003. He has been instrumental in </p><p>     facilitating the work of the RELO in the training of </p><p>     secondary English teachers in the Aleppo Directorate. </p><p>     With nearly 30 years of experience in EFL he has taught </p><p>     in the classroom, supervised and evaluated teachers, </p><p>     and is currently responsible for the day to day </p><p>     management of over 300 teachers in his district.  In </p><p>     this key position he is responsible for carrying out </p><p>     the national curriculum, making sure that his teacher </p><p>     follow the prescribed methodology, and upgrading the </p><p>     skills of his teachers. The amount of training </p><p>     available to him in Syria has been minimal.  He does </p><p>     attend the national conferences and has participated in </p><p>     training sessions organized by both the British Council </p><p>     and the American language center, but he has relied on </p><p>     his own initiative and resources to carry out his </p><p>     responsibilities.  These efforts have earned the </p><p>     respect and admiration of the teachers, university </p><p>     professor, and ministry officials. Attending TESOL will </p><p>     enable him to expand his network of resources, deepen </p><p>     his own understanding of theory and methodology and </p><p>     gain first hand knowledge of life in the United States. </p><p>     The multiplier effect of his trip will be immediate and </p><p>     far-reaching.  He is an ideal candidate for this </p><p>     program. </p><p> </p><p>4.   MS. SAMYA ABOU HAMAD - LEBANON. Ms. Abou Hamad is </p><p>     the Head of the English Department of the Educational </p><p>     Center of Research and Development, Ministry of </p><p>     Education, Lebanon to attend TESOL 2003.

ESP Coordinator and Instructor at the Faculty of </p><p>          Business and Economics at the Lebanese University </p><p>     iii. Coordinator of English Language Methodology books </p><p>          for students\' teachers at the normal schools in </p><p>          Lebanon. </p><p>     Because of these responsibilities and the fact the </p><p>     Ms. Abou Hamad never has been to the States, her </p><p>     attendance of TESOL will be a tremendous step in </p><p>     professional development. </p><p> </p><p>5.
