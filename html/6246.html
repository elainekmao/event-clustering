<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 001429 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/10/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PINR, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: OUT WITH THE OLD, IN WITH THE NEW; KING </p><p>RECONFIGURES ROYAL COURT </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMBASSADOR EDWARD W. GNEHM FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) King Abdullah revamped the Royal Court on March 9, </p><p>replacing his most senior advisor, Chief of the Royal Court </p><p>Fayez Tarawneh, and creating a new Cabinet position with the </p><p>title Minister of the Royal Court.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>NEW ROYAL COURT: NEW FACES </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) In an unexpected move, King Abdullah issued a royal </p><p>decree on March 9 appointing Chief of the Royal Court, Fayez </p><p>Tarawneh, to the Senate.  Tarawneh had been in his position </p><p>for four years and was substantively engaged with the King on </p><p>many issues.  (Comment: The King has often used appointment </p><p>to the Senate as a way to gracefully retire a senior official </p><p>he wishes to replace.  End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) His replacement on the Court is Yousef Dalabih, who </p><p>most recently served as Minister of State for Parliamentary </p><p>Affairs in Prime Minister Abul Ragheb\'s first Cabinet (June </p><p>2000-June 2001).  Dalabih is from the prominent East Bank </p><p>Bani Hassan tribe.  After graduating from Sandhurst military </p><p>academy in 1964, Dalabih rose to the rank of General in the </p><p>Army before his service in the Cabinet.  Dalabih had a fairly </p><p>low profile in the government and is not well known to the </p><p>Embassy.  Among our contacts, he is known as an </p><p>administrator, not a politician, and is generally well </p><p>respected. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) King Abdullah also reinstated the Cabinet position of </p><p>Minister of the Royal Court and appointed Faisal al-Fayez, </p><p>the Chief of Royal Protocol to the position.  Al-Fayez is </p><p>from the prominent Bani Sakher tribe.  The King also named </p><p>Emad Fakhouri as the General Coordinator of Royal Court </p><p>planning and Sharif Mohammad Ben Abdul Hamid Altuheymaq </p><p>replaced Fayez as the Chief of Royal Protocol. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Emad Fakhouri, a well known contact of the Embassy, </p><p>most recently served as Investment and Development </p><p>Commissioner at the Aqaba Special Economic Zone Authority. </p><p>In his role there, Fakhouri was enthusiastic, bright, and </p><p>hard-working.  He was one of the few commissioners who </p><p>rejected the "Excellency" title, an indication that he saw </p><p>his work as a job rather than an honorific.  Sharif Mohammad </p><p>has previously worked protocol issues at the Royal Court and </p><p>was the Court\'s point of contact during Vice President </p><p>Cheney\'s visit to Jordan last year.  Mohammad has traveled to </p><p>the US and UK, and worked closely with the embassy-sponsored </p><p>American Language School to sponsor English language training </p><p>for Palace staff.  He also has private sector experience in a </p><p>local Public Relations firm. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) FM Muasher, in a conversation with the Ambassador, </p><p>commented that the changes in the Royal Court reflect a </p><p>general downgrading of its function.  In addition to removing </p><p>some holdovers from King Hussein\'s reign (e.g. Tarawneh), </p><p>King Abdullah appears to be creating a Royal Court with a </p><p>more administrative, rather than advisory, role.  One Embassy </p><p>contact opined that the King appointed men from two key </p><p>tribes so they could handle any tribal dissension if there </p><p>are hostilities with Iraq.  "A tribesman to deal with his </p><p>tribe in their own language." </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) The reshuffle in the Royal Court staff will make it a </p><p>more administrative and support organization.  Former Court </p><p>Chief Tarawneh, who often participated in King Abdullah\'s </p><p>substantive meetings, is out.  New Royal Court Minister </p><p>Fayez, who served a largely support and scheduling function </p><p>as Chief of Protocol, has been elevated.  This move seems to </p><p>indicate that the King wishes to get his policy advice from </p><p>quarters formally outside the Palace. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
