<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001062 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF/S, DRL </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JFRAZER </p><p> </p><p>E. O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, ELAB, PGOV, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT:  LABOR INCHES ITS WAY TOWARDS FURTHER MASS ACTION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED.  NOT FOR INTERNET POSTING. </p><p> </p><p>1.(SBU)  On May 27, the independent press published calls </p><p>from the opposition party Movement for Democratic Change </p><p>(MDC) for a week-long series of "marches" beginning on June </p><p>2.  The press characterizes these as part of the "final </p><p>push" to remove President Mugabe from power.  While labor </p><p>contacts believe that some of their members will participate </p><p>in the MDC action, labor leaders will not call for </p><p>simultaneous action on their own part.  Instead, they plan </p><p>to call for further stayaways in July, should the opposition </p><p>action in June not bring about change. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU)  Comment:  This follows the pattern of the recent </p><p>interplay between these two civic groups, wherein the MDC </p><p>called for a stayaway in March, and the Zimbabwe Congress of </p><p>Trade Unions (ZCTU) followed this with its own stayaway the </p><p>following month.  Labor continues to be concerned with the </p><p>separation of its role from that of the official opposition </p><p>party.  Additionally, much of the ZCTU leadership\'s </p><p>attention will be focused on the annual International Labor </p><p>Organization\'s (ILO\'s) International Labour Conference in </p><p>Geneva during the first week of June.  Several contentious </p><p>issues raised during last year\'s conference will be </p><p>addressed, and it is unlikely that any global call for </p><p>action will take place during the absence of the ZCTU\'s </p><p>President and Secretary General.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p>Sullivan </p><p></p></div>
