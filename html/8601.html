<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 AMMAN 003420 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/09/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, SOCI, JO, INRB </p><p>SUBJECT: ZARQA ELECTION PRIMER </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Charge D\'Affaires Greg Berry, reasons 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (c)  Summary:  Mohammed Arsalan, a long-time Embassy </p><p>contact and candidate for the "Chechen" seat representing </p><p>Zarqa in the new parliament, spoke with econoff at some </p><p>length about the election process (Byzantine), his chances </p><p>(good), and the primary concerns of the Zarqa constituency </p><p>(surprising).  He also shared his views on the sources of </p><p>strength for the Islamic Action Front/Muslim Brotherhood, and </p><p>on the factors limiting their political influence.  Should </p><p>Arsalan win his seat, he will be a strong advocate for </p><p>continued economic reform and openness, and may have some </p><p>success bringing other MP\'s into the fold.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>NUMBERS, PREDICTIONS </p><p> </p><p>2.  (sbu)  Mohammed Arsalan is the 45-year old former </p><p>Secretary General of the Zarqa Chamber of Industry and a long </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>time Embassy contact.  He is currently a candidate for the </p><p>"Chechen" seat in Zarqa governorate for the June 17 </p><p>parliamentary elections.  Arsalan recently described to </p><p>econoff his campaign experiences, as well as the overall mood </p><p>of Zarqans toward the election process and other issues of </p><p>the day. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (sbu)  The seat Arsalan is contesting is one of 10 in the </p><p>governorate, and one of four in the district containing the </p><p>city of Zarqa.  Of the other three seats in the district, two </p><p>are "reserved" for Arab Muslims, and the other is reserved </p><p>for a Christian candidate.  For this election, a total of 37 </p><p>candidates have registered to contest the 10 seats in the </p><p>governorate.  Of those, four are contesting the Chechen seat, </p><p>including an IAF candidate, an independent woman, and a </p><p>"wealthy" male doctor with support in the Palestinian </p><p>community.  The total pool of potential voters in the </p><p>governorate is around 151,000.  Seats for the Zarqa district </p><p>are allocated to the top two Arab Muslim vote getters, the </p><p>top Christian candidate (regardless of overall popular vote), </p><p>and the top Chechen candidate.  Thus Arsalan will likely </p><p>finish somewhere in the top third of the pack of the 37 </p><p>candidates, but expects to finish first among Chechen </p><p>candidates. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (sbu)  Arsalan said voter turnout is expected to be low - </p><p>he estimated no more than 25-30 percent of registered voters </p><p>would cast votes.  Because of his own dogged campaigning, </p><p>though, he expects to garner some 3,000 votes for himself, </p><p>which he expects will easily outdistance his nearest </p><p>competitor.  Arsalan predicted that the IAF candidate </p><p>opposing him would gather no more than 250 votes.  For the </p><p>governorate, Arsalan predicted the IAF would control no more </p><p>than 3 or 4 seats, with the balance going to independent </p><p>candidates who will secure votes based on tribal/family </p><p>affiliations, ethnic/religious ties, or exceptional financial </p><p>resources used to paper the governorate with campaign </p><p>posters.  He added that few of these candidates were long on </p><p>substance, and he expected to be able to lead the </p><p>independents as a bloc of 6-7 MP\'s. </p><p> </p><p>ANATOMY OF A CAMPAIGN </p><p> </p><p>5.  (sbu)  Arsalan\'s campaign, like that of almost all </p><p>independent candidates, is almost completely self-financed. </p><p>Arsalan said that to run a campaign or create a party, heavy </p><p>self-financing was critical, since voters had a very poor </p><p>record of supporting candidates financially.  Ironically, </p><p>Arsalan said he could not even secure an endorsement from his </p><p>previous employer, the Zarqa Chamber of Industry, due to </p><p>personal disagreements between himself and the Chairman of </p><p>the Board.  This despite the fact that Arsalan is widely </p><p>known to support exactly the kinds of policies the Chamber </p><p>advocates. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (sbu)  Arsalan has instead relied on his contacts in the </p><p>Chechen community as the main base of his support.  In what </p><p>he termed a real revolution, he convinced the traditionally </p><p>conservative, anti-liberalization community to back him over </p><p>more conservative candidates.  He credits his ability to win </p><p>the support of the community to the skills he learned while </p><p>participating in a series of USAID-funded public speaking and </p><p>management seminars over the past year.  He said this </p><p>training, and his ability to speak on substantive (read: </p><p>economic) issues has set him well apart from the rest of the </p><p>field of candidates. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (sbu)  Arsalan has maintained a grueling campaign </p><p>schedule, spending every day speaking with walk-ins to his </p><p>campaign headquarters and every night (often until 3:00 a.m.) </p><p>speaking to small groups (10-30) of constituents, both to </p><p>gauge their interests and to elicit their support.  He noted </p><p>with surprise the large number of students from local </p><p>universities who have visited him in his offices, an </p><p>illustration, he says, of a visibly higher level of awareness </p><p>of issues among the constituency.  Arsalan expressed </p><p>particular joy at speaking with students:  "I don\'t have to </p><p>walk them through the ABC\'s of every issue - I can start at </p><p>K."  By contrast, he said his opponents have steered clear of </p><p>discussions, relying instead on aggressive "paper the town" </p><p>approaches in an effort to get name recognition on the ballot </p><p>through the use of campaign posters. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (sbu)  Arsalan said the IAF initially launched strong </p><p>attacks against him, accusing him of being a tool of the </p><p>Americans and a Free Mason (a less inflammatory substitute </p><p>for "Zionist"), and of selling visas to the U.S. in return </p><p>for votes.  He said they stopped perpetuating these rumors, </p><p>though, after a few months when they saw the rumors were not </p><p>gaining any traction among voters.  He said the IAF probably </p><p>also decided to focus its energies on winning the two Arab </p><p>Muslim seats in the Zarqa city district, and as a result </p><p>could not sustain negative campaigning against him. </p><p> </p><p>ISSUES AND VIEWS FROM ZARQA\'S VOTING PUBLIC </p><p> </p><p>9.  (sbu)  Arsalan said there was a great deal of voter </p><p>apathy to overcome in this election.  He said that, as a </p><p>result of perceived voting irregularities in the last </p><p>parliamentary election, and a long-standing belief that </p><p>districts were "Gerrymandered" to limit the power of the IAF, </p><p>voters simply distrusted the system.  With little confidence </p><p>in the system, many voters were reluctant to go to the polls. </p><p> Arsalan said his message to these voters was that a low </p><p>turn-out only favors extremism and backwardness, and that a </p><p>decision to "get out the vote" would help moderates and those </p><p>who championed growth.  He said the approach had resonated </p><p>somewhat, but he did not expect that he alone would be able </p><p>to significantly affect turnout. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (sbu)  He said that most voters (somewhat surprisingly) </p><p>are hungry for a candidate who can talk about "pocketbook" </p><p>issues, one who knows something about the economy and can </p><p>translate pronouncements from the cabinet into programs for </p><p>Zarqans, jobs, and food on the table.  He added that many </p><p>voters are just plain tired of listening to political </p><p>rhetoric, either on Peace process issues, Iraq, or terrorism. </p><p> They are equally tired of constant announcements of new </p><p>programs by the cabinet that don\'t result in noticeable </p><p>improvements to their standard of living.  Related to this, </p><p>Arsalan said many voters talk of wanting "equality and </p><p>justice," i.e. equal opportunities for all Jordanians to </p><p>benefit from programs, foreign aid, new business, and the </p><p>like.  The inability of the cabinet to deliver has, Arsalan </p><p>said, hurt prospects for Abul Ragheb and the cabinet to </p><p>retain their positions after the elections - especially now </p><p>that new appointments would have to be confirmed by MP\'s. </p><p>Arsalan said he has been pounding the accountability in </p><p>government theme to Zarqa voters, with good response.  (Note: </p><p> other Embassy contacts recently gave Abul Ragheb a 50-50 </p><p>chance of retaining office after the elections.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p>11.  (sbu)  On Iraq, Arsalan said he is hearing nothing.  He </p><p>said Zarqans are bitterly angry at Saddam and, by extension, </p><p>at Iraq and Iraqis, for being "all talk, no action."  He said </p><p>voters were stunned by the total and rapid collapse of Iraq\'s </p><p>armed forces, and that the Iraq debacle further shook their </p><p>willingness to believe posturing by political leaders, both </p><p>in the government and in the IAF and local community.  On the </p><p>U.S., he said almost everyone is schizophrenic - of course </p><p>they agree with the ideals America stands for, but almost </p><p>everyone is strongly opposed to current American policies in </p><p>the region and America\'s treatment of Arabs in the region and </p><p>in the U.S.  He added it was too soon to see any measurable </p><p>difference in opinion as a result of the Aqaba summit, but </p><p>acknowledged that the issue of Palestine is closely and </p><p>continuously watched by Zarqa voters. </p><p> </p><p>PILLARS AND RESTRAINTS ON THE IAF </p><p> </p><p>12.  (sbu)  Arsalan said the strength of the IAF in general </p><p>was modest - they probably could count on no more than 10% of </p><p>votes in Zarqa, and probably similar figures elsewhere in </p><p>Jordan.  The votes they control, though, he said they control </p><p>completely.  The IAF, he continued, draws its strength from </p><p>two main areas:  first, they are exceptionally well organized </p><p>in a system in which there are no other well organized </p><p>parties to speak of, only masses of independent candidates. </p><p>Not only can they mobilize voters, but they can mobilize </p><p>services and support for communities in which they are </p><p>prominent.  From mosque building to emergency food relief to </p><p>other charity work (often financed from outside Jordan), the </p><p>IAF can deliver to communities in need - thus gaining </p><p>legitimacy and improving their following.  Second, they can </p><p>claim to speak for God - who, Arsalan pointed out, </p><p>consistently enjoys good approval ratings.  Not only does </p><p>this give the IAF moral authority in some sectors, it also </p><p>dismisses them from the burden of developing an issue-based </p><p>platform.  Instead, they simply point to the Koran and tell </p><p>voters that Islam has the answer - whatever the question. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (sbu)  While these mechanisms make for a tightly-knit </p><p>organization, Arsalan said the influence of the IAF has been </p><p>slipping for years, due mainly to their self-imposed exile </p><p>from political dialogue in Jordan for the past several years. </p><p> This decision, Arsalan said, probably cost them 30% of their </p><p>support base, since "now two generations have grown up not </p><p>knowing about the IAF."  Also, in recent months, the IAF was </p><p>delivered a black eye when it rallied support for Saddam </p><p>Hussein and Iraq, gleefully repeating Saddam\'s propaganda, </p><p>only to find itself standing firmly on the losing side and </p><p>lacking all credibility.  These two trends have left a sour </p><p>taste in the mouths of many voters who would traditionally </p><p>have been sympathetic to IAF positions, but now see the IAF </p><p>in the same light as any other political animal - long on </p><p>slogans, short on substance. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p> </p><p>14.  (c)  Arsalan is a practical, capable, affable, and above </p><p>all active member of the Zarqa community.  He is not afraid </p><p>to take risks - he is the only liberal running in the </p><p>governorate, and the only candidate to feature the Jordanian </p><p>flag in his campaign materials - a nod to the King\'s "Jordan </p><p>First" campaign and a slap in the face to Islamists and </p><p>Palestinian hard-liners alike.  Arsalan has long been a </p><p>supporter of the QIZ\'s, the FTA, and any other program that </p><p>can help improve the lives of average Jordanians.  He will </p><p>seek membership in Parliament\'s economic and foreign </p><p>relations committees, where he could prove an opinion leader </p><p>among moderate MP\'s. </p><p>BERRY </p><p></p></div>
