REASON:  1.5(B,D). </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  In a May 23 meeting with Prime Minister Sher Bahadur </p><p>Deuba, Ambassador Malinowski and British Charge Andrew </p><p>Mitchell emphasized that the dissolution of Parliament </p><p>presents the PM with a rare opportunity to form a technocrat, </p><p>reformist Cabinet that could re-institute good governance, </p><p>eliminate corruption, and improve the security situation </p><p>throughout the country.  The PM acknowledged those points, </p><p>but seems more focused for now on regaining his party\'s good </p><p>graces and on initiating party preparations for elections. </p><p>The intra-party machinations of his political rival, former </p><p>PM G.P. Koirala, left him no alternative but to ask the </p><p>Cabinet to dissolve the Lower House.  He plans to address the </p><p>nation on television the evening of May 24.  He does not </p><p>intend to bring extension of the emergency before the </p><p>National Assembly (the as-yet undissolved Upper House of </p><p>Parliament) but will instead re-institute it through </p><p>ordinance for another three months.  The Army has assured him </p><p>it can provide adequate security for the elections to take </p><p>place within six months.  While he does not doubt the King\'s </p><p>commitment to democracy, he fears that some "people around </p><p>him" may harbor anti-democratic sentiments.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>DISSOLUTION THE ONLY WAY </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  On May 23 Ambassador Malinowski and British Charge </p><p>Andrew Mitchell called on Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba </p><p>to discuss implications of the May 22 decision to dissolve </p><p>the Lower House of Parliament (Ref C). Deuba told the envoys </p><p>the constant conniving of his political rival, ruling Nepali </p><p>Congress Party President and former PM G.P. Koirala, had left </p><p>him "no alternative" but to ask the Cabinet to recommend </p><p>dissolution.  Koirala\'s allegations that the PM had not </p><p>adequately consulted with the party before pursuing extension </p><p>of the emergency were untrue; Deuba had met with party </p><p>leaders twice and the security chiefs once before he </p><p>introduced the extension proposal in the Parliamentary </p><p>Secretariat.  None of the party chiefs contacted, including </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Koirala, had ever raised any objection to the extension, he </p><p>complained. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Even though Deuba acknowledged that he has a (slight) </p><p>edge against Koirala among his party MPs, his long-time rival </p><p>"could move against me at any time and sack me from the </p><p>party."  (Note:  At the time of the meeting, Deuba had not </p><p>yet been suspended from the Nepali Congress Party.  The </p><p>suspension order gave him three days in which to clarify his </p><p>decision to defy the party.  End note.)  "I have the votes in </p><p>Parliament, but for how long?"  Koirala would never cease </p><p>trying to lure away Deuba supporters in Parliament.  In fact, </p><p>Koirala had intended to bring a no-confidence motion against </p><p>him the very next day, Deuba learned.  Prolonged political </p><p>in-fighting could demoralize the security forces and boost </p><p>Maoist insurgents\' efforts to destabilize the country.  Hence </p><p>his pre-emptive strike in dissolving Parliament. </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>NEXT STEPS? </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Ambassador Malinowski noted the current situation, </p><p>while regrettable, afforded Deuba a valuable opportunity to </p><p>form a new, smaller Cabinet with well-regarded, talented </p><p>technocrats and members of other parties to address the many </p><p>pressing problems, such as the Maoist insurgency and rampant </p><p>corruption, that Koirala\'s constant back-biting had </p><p>distracted him from resolving.  The Ambassador reported </p><p>raising the topic with Opposition Leader Madhav Nepal, along </p><p>with British CDA Mitchell, earlier in the day (Ref B), and </p><p>stressed the Opposition has "an open mind" about </p><p>participating in a national government.   Deuba could address </p><p>the nation publicly on his plans, emphasizing that he was </p><p>putting politics aside during this time of national crisis </p><p>and would concentrate on these priorities during the six </p><p>months before the election.  He should appeal to the nation\'s </p><p>voters to judge for themselves at election time whether or </p><p>not he had fulfilled his pledge, the Ambassador urged. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Deuba concurred with the Ambassador\'s suggestion, but </p><p>noted that his first priority  is to restore unity in the </p><p>Nepali Congress.  "I\'m a party person," he explained, "and so </p><p>I want a united party to go for the poll."  After sorting out </p><p>the intra-party discord, he might explore the possibility of </p><p>a national Cabinet that could include the Opposition. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) British Charge Andrew Mitchell took up the theme of </p><p>Deuba seizing the chance to form a high-powered Cabinet that </p><p>could effectively address national problems.  The dissolution </p><p>could actually be a great opportunity for Deuba to announce a </p><p>new Cabinet as a reforming government and demonstrate to </p><p>people that democracy can work.  By appealing directly to </p><p>people\'s interests, he could win their support for the </p><p>upcoming elections.  He asked what the PM\'s strategy over the </p><p>next few days would be. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Deuba agreed with the sense of the British Charge\'s </p><p>points, but returned again to his central preoccupation:  the </p><p>threat from within his own party.  With the return of his </p><p>mentor and party patriarch K.P. Bhattarai from abroad the </p><p>following day, Deuba said he would be in a better position to </p><p>address that challenge.  The Ambassador asked if he planned </p><p>to put his case before the nation; Deuba said he would do so </p><p>in a televised address May 24. </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>SECURITY </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) With Parliament dissolved, the Ambassador asked, what </p><p>will happen to the emergency?  Deuba said he would not bring </p><p>the motion before the National Assembly, the (as-yet) </p><p>undissolved Upper House of Parliament.  (Comment:  He does </p><p>not have sufficient support within the National Assembly to </p><p>win a two-thirds vote.  King Gyanendra told the Ambassador </p><p>later in the day that the Cabinet had just asked him to </p><p>dissolve the Upper House.  The King said he would do so the </p><p>next day--May 24.  End comment.)  Instead, he plans to allow </p><p>the emergency to lapse and then have it re-introduced by </p><p>ordinance.  According to the Constitution, the emergency </p><p>could then last no more than three months.  Deuba said that </p><p>he would not want a longer extension in any event--and might </p><p>actually abridge its duration to two months--since it would </p><p>interfere with campaigning for the November polls. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  The Ambassador asked if the Royal Nepal Army (RNA) </p><p>leadership is confident that it could provide adequate </p><p>security during the election period and if voter lists--some </p><p>of which may have been damaged during attacks on local </p><p>government offices--are intact.  The PM replied yes to both </p><p>questions, noting that copies of voter lists have been </p><p>maintained at the Election Commission in Kathmandu.  The </p><p>elections could also be staggered, Deuba said, with voting </p><p>taking place in certain districts on different days, but with </p><p>the final count taking place on the same day.  There is </p><p>already such a precedent.  He added that he was meeting with </p><p>the Chief of Army Staff later in the evening. </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>THE PALACE </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C)  The Ambassador advised the PM that he and the </p><p>British Charge would be meeting King Gyanendra later in the </p><p>evening.  Deuba predicted that the King would assure them of </p><p>his staunch support of Constitutional democracy.  Deuba asked </p><p>that the two envoys "suggest  to the King that he should </p><p>cooperate with democracy."  The PM said he isn\'t worried that </p><p>the King himself harbors any anti-democratic ambitions, but </p><p>rather that some "people around him" are "not in favor" of </p><p>democracy.  The Ambassador stressed that the U.S. could only </p><p>provide assistance to Nepal if democracy remains intact. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C)  Chronic political infighting, in our view, has been </p><p>the main impediment to Deuba\'s ability to demonstrate his </p><p>effectiveness as a leader.  His critics, however, both within </p><p>his own party and in the Opposition, have long alleged that </p><p>he is unable to assert forcefully enough the power of the </p><p>civilian government.  His insistence on continuing the </p><p>emergency, presumably at the behest of either or both the RNA </p><p>and the Palace, against the opposition of his own party will </p><p>only reinforce that perception in some quarters.  While the </p><p>Prime Minister agreed with the Ambassador and the British </p><p>Charge\'s suggestions about the possible opportunities the </p><p>current crisis presents, his main attention was obviously </p><p>focused on saving his position within the party--and thus his </p><p>chances for a Nepali Congress nomination in the impending </p><p>elections.  The party\'s decision just one hour later to </p><p>suspend him (Ref C)--with the ever-imminent threat of </p><p>ultimate expulsion--prove just how short-sighted his </p><p>preoccupation was.  As a self-proclaimed "party person," </p><p>Deuba risks being soon cut adrift from that political </p><p>mooring.  The PM\'s slight edge in support among his party\'s </p><p>MPs is unlikely to survive his probable expulsion in a </p><p>society where virtually every association--from trade unions </p><p>to human rights groups to university clubs--has a partisan </p><p>affiliation.  We have seen no evidence of anti-democratic </p><p>elements at work in the Palace, as Deuba speculated, but will </p><p>monitor the situation closely. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
