<p>UNCLAS HARARE 000959 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>AF/PD FOR COX AND ROBERTSON, AF/S FOR KRAFT AND </p><p>SCHLACHTER, AF/RA FOR SWANN, INR/R/MR, NSC FOR JENDAYI </p><p>FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ZI, PREL, PHUM </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ELECTION AFTERMATH; HARARE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.   Under headline "Who will save us from fellow </p><p>   Africans?" the independent daily "The Daily News" </p><p>   dedicated its April 22 edition to condemning African </p><p>   leaders for supporting the Government of Zimbabwe after </p><p>   fatally flawed March presidential poll.  "We really </p><p>   thing their action was not just irresponsible, but must </p><p>   be criminalized (sic) under international law," the </p><p>   editorial thundered.  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>2.   ". . .Africa is fast slipping back into what it </p><p>   used to be - a very dark continent - courtesy of its </p><p>   leaders who, although educated, want to base their rule </p><p>   on the feudal system.  African leaders seem united by </p><p>   one rotten factor: They are so obsessed with power </p><p>   that, once elected, they quickly put in place </p><p>   mechanisms making it virtually impossible for the </p><p>   people to remove them.  That in itself wouldn\'t be such </p><p>   a bad thing if they weren\'t so oppressive, repressive </p><p>   and corrupt.  The most worrying aspect in Africa\'s </p><p>   ongoing slide back to its dark past is the emerging </p><p>   pattern among its leaders of rallying to each other\'s </p><p>   support in complete disregard of the people\'s will and </p><p>   welfare.  It is what the highly principled Senegalese </p><p>   President, Andoulaye Wade, who clearly is an exception </p><p>   to the rule, derisively referred to as \'this trade </p><p>   union of presidents.\' </p><p> </p><p>   "The political crisis in this country has exposed </p><p>   that evil developed for the whole world to see. </p><p>   All truly neutral observers saw last month\'s </p><p>   presidential election as a gigantic fraud contrived </p><p>   to give victory where it did not belong and so </p><p>   refused to endorse the results.  But, incredibly </p><p>   and to their eternal shame, \'the trade union of </p><p>   African presidents,\' who must be told in no </p><p>   uncertain terms that they have on their hands the </p><p>   blood of all Zimbabweans being tortured and killed </p><p>   to keep ZANU PF in power, chose to gloss over all </p><p>   the glaring flaws and declared the poll legitimate </p><p>   and the results acceptable.  We really think their </p><p>   action was not just irresponsible, but must be </p><p>   criminalized (sic) under international law. . .The </p><p>   question must be asked: Who will save us from the </p><p>   cruelty of our selfish fellow Africans?  While </p><p>   there may be no obvious answer to that question, </p><p>   all despotic African leaders can be sure of at </p><p>   least one thing: Those who make peaceful political </p><p>   change impossible make violent revolution </p><p>   inevitable." </p><p> </p><p>WHITEHEAD </p><p></p></div>
