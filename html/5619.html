<p>UNCLAS OTTAWA 000386 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: TSPA, CA </p><p>SUBJECT:  GALILEO DEMARCHE - CANADIAN GOVERNMENT SUPPORTS U.S. </p><p>POSITION ON M-CODE OVERLAY </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) STATE 259165 B) Ottawa 00374 </p><p> </p><p>1. This is a sensitive but unclassified cable and should be treated </p><p>accordingly. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) In response to reftel A request for a high-level demarche </p><p>on EU plans for Galileo Public Regulated Service (PRS) to overlay </p><p>the radio frequencies used by the GPS M-code, Ambassador Cellucci </p><p>wrote letters to the Ministers of Defense, Foreign Affairs, </p><p>Transportation and Industry.  Minister of Foreign Affairs Graham </p><p>provided a coordinated response from the Government of Canada in </p><p>his letter of January 27, 2003 to the Ambassador.  The text of the </p><p>letter, provided in paragraph 2 below, provides assurances that </p><p>Canada will "continue to fully support the United States in urging </p><p>the European Commission to agree to adopt different frequencies </p><p>from the M-code." Ambassador Cellucci also discussed this issue </p><p>with Minister of Transportation Collenette on January 31. </p><p>Collenette echoed the supportive position expressed in Graham\'s </p><p>letter. </p><p> </p><p>3. Text of Minister Graham\'s letter. </p><p> </p><p>Dear Ambassador: </p><p> </p><p>     Thank you for your letter of December 19, 2002, regarding the </p><p>proposed European Galileo satellite navigation system and the </p><p>implications for NATO members. </p><p>     Canada has always publicly maintained the position that </p><p>Galileo and the Global Positioning System (GPS) of the United </p><p>States should be compatible and interoperable for the benefit of </p><p>all potential users. </p><p> </p><p>     As noted in your letter, the European Commission (EC) has </p><p>recommended that Galileo\'s Public Regulated Service" (or PRS), use </p><p>the same frequencies that are used by the military service (M-code) </p><p>of the GPS.  During discussions at NATO, Canada has publicly stated </p><p>its concern that, by sharing the same frequencies, the ability of </p><p>the Alliance to jam enemy forces employing the Galileo system could </p><p>be impeded.  Canada\'s position is that Galileo should not use the </p><p>same frequencies at the GPS M-code signal unless it can </p><p>conclusively be proven that there will be no interference with the </p><p>military use of the GPS. </p><p> </p><p>     To that end, Canada has urged the European Commission to </p><p>conduct a thorough testing of the system design to prove its claim </p><p>that overlaying the Galileo PRS code on the GPS M-code would not in </p><p>any way interfere with the military use of the GPS.  The EC has yet </p><p>to conclusively prove its claim.  Until the EC can do so, Canada </p><p>will continue to fully support the United States in urging the </p><p>European Commission to agree to adopt different frequencies from </p><p>the M-code.  With the assistance of the European Union members in </p><p>NATO, we will support efforts to generate a consensus to drop the M- </p><p>code overlay option for the Galileo system. </p><p> </p><p>     I look forward to discussing this issue with you in the coming </p><p>months with a view to seeking a resolution in favour of an </p><p>effective global civil navigation satellite system architecture. </p><p> </p><p>                              Sincerely </p><p></p></div>
