(C) Embassy appreciates Libreville\'s detailed report on </p><p>preparations for a second meeting at Libreville this weekend </p><p>which would follow up the October 28 meeting held at Kinshasa. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) While there has been a good deal of local media </p><p>speculation about a Libreville summit, with widely varying </p><p>dates given, the Congolese government has said nothing </p><p>publicly to confirm the date or Kabila\'s participation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Nonetheless, there are some signs that point to the </p><p>likelihood that Kabila will take part.  Presidential Deputy </p><p>Cabinet Director Jean Mbuyu, who is one of Kabila\'s principal </p><p>point persons with rebel and ex-Mobutist leaders, told the </p><p>Ambassador December 15 that he would be in Libreville next </p><p>week to assist with preparations for the summit.  Also, while </p><p>making arrangements to see Kabila at the weekend, his private </p><p>secretary was more guarded than usual with the Ambassador </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>concerning Kabila\'s availability over the weekend. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SWING </p><p></p></div>
