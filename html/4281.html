<p>S E C R E T AMMAN 006610 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/11/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PTER, JO, LE, SY, IR </p><p>SUBJECT: DEMARCHE DELIVERED ON POSSIBLE HIZBALLAH RESUPPLY </p><p>FLIGHT </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. SECSTATE 225699 B. RIYADH 07422 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMBASSADOR EDWARD W. GNEHM FOR REAPONS 1.5 (B), (C), AND </p><p> (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (S/NF) DCM delivered Ref A demarche on November 9 to Ali </p><p>al-Ayad, personal assistant to FONMIN Muasher.  Ali promised </p><p>to provide the information to the appropriate people in the </p><p>GOJ and asked for further details on the flight as soon as </p><p>they are available.  DCM also provided the text of the </p><p>demarche to ORCA for follow-up in other channels. </p><p> </p><p>2. (S/NF) The Ambassador took up the issue with GID Director </p><p>Sa\'ad Kheir on November 11.  Kheir pointed out that Saudi </p><p>Arabia was by far the best placed to deal with the problem. </p><p>That said, if there were clear evidence that a specific </p><p>flight was transporting arms, Kheir said, Jordan would insist </p><p>on inspecting the aircraft as a matter of course.  He noted, </p><p>however, that the Turks had forced an Iranian plane to land, </p><p>only to discover that it was carrying "vegetables."  The </p><p>already touchy Jordanian-Iranian relationship did not need </p><p>that kind of embarrassment. </p><p> </p><p>3. (S/NF) Comment: The Jordanians are pleased that Saudi </p><p>Arabia denied overflight (ref B) and will continue to argue </p><p>that, on purely practical grounds, we should focus on Saudi </p><p>Arabia for such requests in the future. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
