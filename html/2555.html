<p>UNCLAS ABUJA 000696 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR G/TIP, INL AF/RA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KCRM, PHUM, KWMN, KPAO, VT, IT, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: VATICAN ANTI-TIP CONFERENCE: NIGERIAN ROLE? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: VATICAN 00700 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Post read reftel with interest and applauds Embassy </p><p>Vatican\'s initiative in organizing an international </p><p>conference on Trafficking in Persons (TIP) in collaboration </p><p>with the Vatican Secretariat, G/TIP and PD/IIP. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. We would like to suggest that the issue of Nigerian </p><p>trafficking be included in the conference agenda.  Italy is </p><p>the largest destination for women and girls trafficked from </p><p>Nigeria for sexual exploitation in Europe. An estimated </p><p>18-20,000 Nigerian women and girls are currently in a </p><p>trafficked situation in Italy.  The Italian government has </p><p>embarked on a program of assistance (estimated at $4 million) </p><p>to improve law enforcement efforts against the traffickers </p><p>behind this trade and to help efforts to repatriate and </p><p>reintegrate rescued TIP victims. (Note. On March 1 the </p><p>Italian government repatriated 156 Nigerian girls and women </p><p>to Lagos aboard two chartered aircraft. End Note.)  Post </p><p>discusses this issue regularly with the Italian Ambassador to </p><p>Nigeria, who desires greater U.S.-Italian collaboration on </p><p>anti-TIP efforts.  G/TIP officers are aware of late 2000 </p><p>bilateral discussions in Washington on this initiative, which </p><p>we would like to see advanced. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. In addition, CARITAS and Catholic NGO Community Pope John </p><p>XXIII are involved in addressing the Nigeria-to-Italy TIP </p><p>problem.  In February 2001 the Nigerian NGO "WOTCLEF (Women </p><p>Trafficking and Child Labor Eradication Foundation)" led by </p><p>its founder, the wife of the Nigerian Vice-President, hosted </p><p>a regional TIP conference at which the President of Community </p><p>Pope John XXIII, Don Oreste Benzi, spoke on the NGO\'s efforts </p><p>to assist with the rescue and repatriation of Nigerian girls </p><p>and women trafficked to Italy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. We would appreciate Embassy Vatican\'s consideration of the </p><p>Nigerian TIP issue as an agenda item in the upcoming May </p><p>conference.  Also, if appropriate, conference organizers </p><p>might consider inviting a Government of Nigeria </p><p>representative, particularly Michael Mku, President </p><p>Obasanjo\'s Special Assistant for Trafficking in Persons and </p><p>Child Labor. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
