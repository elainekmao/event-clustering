(U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba for </p><p>reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  This is an action message -- please see </p><p>paragraph five. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) MFA Minstate Shaykh Hamdan bin Zayid has now </p><p>engaged on the issue of the approximately 1,000 Iraqis </p><p>stranded in the northern Emirates, principally Dubai </p><p>(see reftel), asking May 5 that we do everything </p><p>possible to resolve this situation as soon as </p><p>possible.  His call may well have been motivated by </p><p>the broad coverage today in the local media of the </p><p>plight of these Iraqis, focusing on the fact that many </p><p>of them (having cancelled their sponsorships here and </p><p>quit their jobs in anticipation of being able to </p><p>return home) have now run short of money; some </p><p>families including women and small children are said </p><p>to be sleeping/living in their automobiles.  The Red </p><p>Crescent Authority (RCA) is also very concerned about </p><p>this situation; a camp for 100 destitute Iraqis has </p><p>been set up in Dubai, but senior RCA officials have </p><p>contacted us to strongly urge that some means be found </p><p>to repatriate these Iraqis before the hot summer </p><p>months set in, and before the issue becomes more of a </p><p>public relations flash-point. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  We have assured our Emirati interlocutors </p><p>that the USG is seized with this issue, but that in </p><p>the absence of a functioning Iraqi immigration and </p><p>customs authority, and with Umm Qasr port currently </p><p>closed to non-humanitarian traffic, there is no </p><p>definitive guidance we can provide them on how to </p><p>resolve this matter.  As an interim response this is </p><p>fine, but we will be pressed for a more positive, </p><p>result-oriented answer soon, particularly as pressure </p><p>on the UAEG to resolve this issue mounts (as it will). </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  Comment and Action Request:  If Umm Qasr </p><p>cannot in-process these stranded Iraqis, we believe </p><p>the UAEG would be willing to consider alternatives -- </p><p>such as facilitating their repatriation overland via </p><p>Kuwait, or Jordan.  However, to leave this situation </p><p>unresolved much longer can only result in more </p><p>negative publicity here and in the region (as noted </p><p>reftel, the stranded Iraqis are already in touch with </p><p>Al-Jazeera television) and concomitant embarrassment </p><p>to the UAEG.  We would appreciate guidance from </p><p>Washington agencies on possible modalities to resolve </p><p>this issue; creative and even temporary fixes would be </p><p>welcome. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  This message coordinated with Amconsul Dubai. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
