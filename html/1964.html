REASONS: </p><p>1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) HARARE 2666  B) HARARE 2642 </p><p> </p><p>BULAWAYO </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) AS EXPECTED, THE OPPOSITION MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE </p><p>(MDC) SWEPT THE SEPTEMBER 8-9 ELECTIONS IN BULAWAYO, WINNING THE </p><p>MAYORAL RACE AND ALL SEVEN CITY COUNCIL SEATS UNDER CONTENTION BY </p><p>A LANDSLIDE.  THE MDC\'S MAYORAL CANDIDATE, JAPHET NDABENI-NCUBE, </p><p>WON 83 PERCENT OF THE VOTES CAST (REPRESENTING 60,988 VOTES), </p><p>WHILE ZANU-PF\'S GEORGE MLILO GARNERED ONLY 17 PERCENT (12,783 </p><p>VOTES).   THIS WAS THE FIRST DIRECT POPULAR ELECTION FOR THE </p><p>MAYORSHIP OF BULAWAYO; PREVIOUS MAYORS WERE APPOINTED OR SELECTED </p><p>BY THE CITY COUNCIL.   AN ECSTATIC NDABENI-NCUBE TOLD JOURNALISTS </p><p>AFTER HIS VICTORY WAS ANNOUNCED, "WE ARE REALLY ON THE ROAD TO </p><p>DEMOCRATIC CHANGE.  THIS IS A VICTORY FOR THE PEOPLE OF BULAWAYO." </p><p>THE OPPOSITION PARTY WON ALL SEVEN COUNCIL SEATS BY HUGE MARGINS, </p><p>GARNERING 72 PERCENT OF THE VOTE IN THE CLOSEST WARD AND 85 </p><p>PERCENT IN THE MDC\'S MOST CONVINCING WIN.  THE MDC NOW HOLDS NINE </p><p>OF THE 29 SEATS ON BULAWAYO\'S CITY COUNCIL (ZANU-PF CONTROLS 17 </p><p>AND THE REMAINING 3 SEATS ARE HELD BY INDEPENDENTS). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) THE RESULTS WERE MARRED BY SOME VIOLENCE AND THE REPORTED </p><p>HARASSMENT OF MDC OFFICIALS, INCLUDING NDABENI-NCUBE HIMSELF.  AS </p><p>NEWS SPREAD THAT THE MDC HAD WON ALL SEVEN CITY COUNCIL SEATS, </p><p>GROUPS OF WAR VETERANS AND ZANU-PF YOUTHS RAMPAGED THROUGH SEVERAL </p><p>STREETS IN BULAWAYO.  ACCORDING TO PRESS REPORTS, THE GROUPS BEAT </p><p>AND STONED THOSE SUSPECTED OF BEING AN OPPOSITION SUPPORTER; </p><p>DOZENS OF CARS WERE REPORTEDLY STONED AND SOME PROPERTY WAS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02678  01 OF 02  120925Z </p><p>DAMAGED.  ARMED RIOT POLICE WERE DEPLOYED TO DISPERSE THE GROUPS. </p><p>SHARI EPPEL, DIRECTOR OF THE BULAWAYO BRANCH OF THE RESPECTED </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS ORGANIZATION AMANI TRUST, TOLD POLITICAL SECTION </p><p>CHIEF THAT TEN PEOPLE WERE INJURED IN THE MELEE, ONE OF WHOM WAS </p><p>HOSPITALIZED WITH A SERIOUS STAB WOUND.  ASKED WHETHER THE VICTIMS </p><p>WERE PREDOMINANTLY SUPPORTERS OF ONE POLITICAL PARTY, EPPEL SAID </p><p>THEY ALL APPEARED TO BE INNOCENT PASSERS-BY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) IN WHAT APPEARED TO BE PRIMARILY A CASE OF SOUR GRAPES, </p><p>NDABENI-NCUBE WAS ACCUSED BY POLICE OF BRIBING A VOTER WHEN HE </p><p>HANDED A Z$20 NOTE (EQUIVALENT TO SIX U.S. CENTS) TO HIS UNCLE TO </p><p>BUY A DRINK, WHILE HIS UNCLE WAS WAITING TO CAST HIS BALLOT.  THE </p><p>PROSECUTOR\'S OFFICE DECLINED TO PROSECUTE.   MORE DISTURBING, </p><p>DURING THE EVENING OF SEPTEMBER 9, THREE SHOTS WERE FIRED IN THE </p><p>GENERAL DIRECTION OF A GROUP OF SENIOR MDC OFFICIALS WHICH </p><p>INCLUDED VICE-PRESIDENT GIBSON SIBANDA, SECRETARY-GENERAL WELSHMAN </p><p>NCUBE, DIRECTOR FOR ELECTIONS PAUL THEMBA-NYATHI, AND NATIONAL </p><p>TREASURER FLETCHER DULINI.  FORTUNATELY, NO ONE WAS INJURED.  MDC </p><p>SPOKESMAN LEARNMORE JONGWE DESCRIBED THE INCIDENT AS A "NAKED </p><p>ATTEMPT TO ASSASSINATE THE VICE-PRESIDENT."   WE ARE NOT </p><p>COMFORTABLE WITH THIS CHARACTERIZATION ABSENT ANY INDEPENDENT </p><p>CORROBORATION. </p><p> </p><p>MAKONI WEST </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) ZANU-PF\'S GIBSON MUNYORO EASILY WON THE PARLIAMENTARY BY- </p><p>ELECTION IN MAKONI WEST WITH 62 PERCENT OF THE VOTE (10,610 </p><p>VOTES), DEFEATING THE MDC\'S REMUS MAKUWAZA, WHO GARNERED 34 </p><p>PERCENT (5841 VOTES).  THREE THOUSAND FEWER VOTERS CAST THEIR </p><p>BALLOTS THAN IN THE JUNE 2000 PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION; THE MDC </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02678  01 OF 02  120925Z </p><p>SECURED 1515 FEWER VOTES THIS TIME WHILE ZANU-PF RECEIVED 528 </p><p>FEWER VOTES.  THE DECLINE IN VOTER TURNOUT MAY BE EXPLAINED BY THE </p><p>FACT THAT THIS WAS A BY-ELECTION.  WE SUSPECT THAT MANY RESIDENTS </p><p>DID NOT BELIEVE IT WAS WORTH MAKING THE SIGNIFICANT EFFORT TO GET </p><p>TO THE NEAREST POLLING STATION WHEN THE STAKES DID NOT APPEAR </p><p>PARTICULARLY HIGH.  PRE-ELECTION VIOLENCE PROBABLY ALSO DETERRED </p><p>SOME VOTERS.  THE ZANU-PF LEADERSHIP WAS ELATED BY THE OUTCOME, </p><p>WHICH THE PROVINCIAL PARTY SPOKESMAN CHARLES PEMHENAYI HERALDED AS </p><p>A SIGN THAT "IMPERIALISM IS ON THE WAY OUT.  THE ELECTION WAS AN </p><p>INDICATION OF HOW THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION WILL GO AFTER </p><p>REALIZING THAT THE MDC WAS BEING SPONSORED BY IMPERIALISTS." </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) THE RESULTS IN BULAWAYO AND MAKONI WEST, WHICH SURPRISED </p><p>FEW OBSERVERS, CONFIRMED THE MDC\'S OVERWHELMING ADVANTAGE IN </p><p>URBANIZED AREAS AND THE RULING PARTY\'S CONTINUING STRENGTH IN </p><p>RURAL REGIONS.  THE BULAWAYO RESULT IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT, AS </p><p>IT GIVES THE MDC CONTROL OF THE MAYORAL SEATS IN TWO OF ZIMBABWE\'S </p><p>PRINCIPAL CITIES -- MASVINGO IS THE OTHER ONE -- AND POTENTIAL </p><p>OPPORTUNITIES TO DEMONSTRATE EFFECTIVE EXECUTIVE LEADERSHIP. </p><p>SENIOR MDC OFFICIALS HAVE TOLD US REGULARLY THAT THEIR PARTY ONLY </p><p>NEEDS TO GARNER 30-40 PERCENT OF THE VOTE IN RURAL CONSTITUENCIES </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ6397 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  02678  02 OF 02  120925Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  CIAE-00  DODE-00  SRPP-00 </p><p>      DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00   VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00 </p><p>      IO-00    L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01 </p><p>      OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00 </p><p>      STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-01   DRL-02 </p><p>      G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /009W </p><p>                  ------------------1DD8A3  120925Z /38 </p><p>P 120909Z SEP 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 9688 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 002678 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL. 09/12/11 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MDC WINS BULAWAYO IN LANDSLIDE BUT LOSES MAKONI WEST </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY SEAT </p><p> </p><p>IN ORDER TO WIN THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION; BY THAT MEASURE, WE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  02678  02 OF 02  120925Z </p><p>EXPECT THE MDC WILL CONSIDER THE MAKONI RESULT SATISFACTORY. </p><p> </p><p>ROTH </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
