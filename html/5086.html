<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 04 AMMAN 000253 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR NEA AND PRM; PLEASE PASS TO USAID </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/13/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREF, PREL, EAID, MOPS, IZ, JO, OFDA </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDAN CHANGES HUMANITARIAN PLANNING TO ACCEPT </p><p>IRAQI REFUGEES IN FIRST STAGE OF ANY CONFLICT </p><p> </p><p>REF: 02 STATE 262459 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: CDA Greg Berry per 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S) Summary and comment:  The Prime Minister, Minister of </p><p>State for Foreign Affairs and JAF Assistant Chief of Staff </p><p>confirmed in separate meetings that, in the event of </p><p>hostilities in Iraq, the GOJ would allow 10,000 to 20,000 </p><p>Iraqi refugees to enter Jordan on a "temporary basis."  JAF </p><p>Assistant Chief of Staff reported the GOJ would set up four </p><p>separate installations for processing of refugees and TCNs: </p><p>a staging facility on the Iraqi/Jordanian border to screen </p><p>refugees and TCNs; two camps with a capacity of 25,000 each </p><p>at Ruweished, Jordan (H-4); and a camp at Nadayim airbase </p><p>inside Iraq, to be established when events make that </p><p>possible.  This is an important practical change from </p><p>previous GOJ policy and contrasts with continuing public GOJ </p><p>statements which insist that Jordanian borders will remain </p><p>closed to all except third-country nationals in the event of </p><p>hostilities.  (It is essential that we respect the </p><p>Jordanians\' requirement for confidentiality on this issue. </p><p>It is highly sensitive in the Jordanian political context.) </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S) The GOJ and UNHCR are in the process of negotiating </p><p>an MOU to delineate responsibilities but negotiations </p><p>reportedly have snagged over the GOJ\'s financial requests. </p><p>The GOJ has asked UNHCR for 51 million JD (approx USD 70 </p><p>million) to cover its costs, but UNHCR has told us it will </p><p>cover only humanitarian assistance costs and not related </p><p>development and infrastructure costs.  We will obtain a list </p><p>of Jordan\'s estimated assistance costs from the Ministry of </p><p>Planning and report via septel.  Given this apparent change </p><p>in GOJ policy, it could be useful for members of the </p><p>PRM/USAID Humanitarian Planning Team to travel to Jordan to </p><p>brief senior GOJ officials on the planned USG humanitarian </p><p>response and possible USG support to the international </p><p>community\'s and GOJ\'s humanitarian assistance efforts.  End </p><p>summary and comment. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>PM:  Iraqi Refugees to be Allowed Entry </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S) Prime Minister Ali Abul Ragheb informed the </p><p>Ambassador January 8 that, in the event of hostilities in </p><p>Iraq, the GOJ would allow Iraqi refugees to enter Jordan and </p><p>would provide camps and some assistance inside the Jordanian </p><p>border.  The PM also referred to a memorandum of </p><p>understanding with UNHCR that would detail the arrangements </p><p>for camps and first asylum procedures. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S) The PM added that he was sending a team to Geneva to </p><p>participate in UNHCR\'s January 12-13 planning meetings and to </p><p>encourage donors to fund a substantial refugee assistance </p><p>package for use by frontline states.  Planning should be for </p><p>long-term camps and should include, inter alia, establishing </p><p>schools for refugees on the assumption that camps would </p><p>likely remain in place for six months to a year or more.  The </p><p>PM asked for strong USG support for a sizable assistance </p><p>package, noting that other donors would base their </p><p>contributions on what the USG pledged.  He added that initial </p><p>figures he had heard of USD 3 million in USG pledges would be </p><p>insufficient for the needs of these camps.  The Ambassador </p><p>assured the PM the USG would be helpful in the effort to </p><p>ensure refugee camps were properly funded and supplied. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p>JAF Confirms Policy; Planning for Two Camps Inside Jordan </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p> </p><p>5.  (S) In a January 12 meeting, Jordanian Armed Forces </p><p>Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence (and chief of the </p><p>GOJ\'s crisis management center) General Mohamed Majid Al </p><p>Eitan confirmed to DCM, Refcoord and Army Attache that the </p><p>GOJ would allow 10,000 to 20,000 Iraqi refugees to enter </p><p>Jordanian territory "in the first stages of a conflict."  Al </p><p>Eitan reported that the GOJ was prepared to set up four </p><p>separate refugee/TCN processing facilities and camps:  one on </p><p>the Baghdad-Amman highway border crossing for initial </p><p>screening of refugees and TCNs; two 75 km inside the </p><p>Jordanian border near Ruweished (H-4), for care and </p><p>processing of refugees and TCNs; and one at an Iraqi airbase </p><p>in Nadayim, to be established only after Iraqi authority </p><p>disintegrates.  (NOTE:  Ruweished, Jordan is also identified </p><p>on maps as H-4.  The Iraqi airbase at Nadayim often is </p><p>incorrectly identified on maps as Ruweished.  The Nadayim </p><p>airbase is located in the "cut-out" that was traded from </p><p>Jordan to Iraq several years ago in exchange for similarly </p><p>sized Iraqi territory.) </p><p>6.  (S) JAF planners have identified four separate groups of </p><p>displaced persons likely to seek assistance in Jordan in the </p><p>event of hostilities in Iraq.  First, foreign diplomats and </p><p>Western nationals fleeing Iraq would be granted immediate </p><p>entry to Jordan for repatriation through commercial flights </p><p>from Amman\'s Queen Alia airport.  Second, TCN workers </p><p>resident in Iraq (believed to number up to 100,000 mostly </p><p>Egyptian and Sudanese nationals) would be screened and </p><p>registered at a processing facility on the Baghdad-Amman </p><p>highway border crossing, where they would be sent in waves to </p><p>the two camps near Ruweished until they could be repatriated. </p><p> (IOM has separately confirmed to us its plans to repatriate </p><p>TCNs with bus transport to Aqaba and then ship transport to </p><p>Nuweibeh, Egypt.  IOM can handle processing of 2,000 TCNs per </p><p>boatload.  IOM has contracted with appropriate transport </p><p>companies, but warns that key bus companies could be occupied </p><p>with Hajj pilgrims if hostilities begin before the end of the </p><p>Hajj, o/a February 12-13.)  Third, the GOJ is prepared to </p><p>accept an estimated 10,000 to 20,000 Iraqi refugees "on </p><p>humanitarian grounds," and only at the early stages of a </p><p>conflict in Iraq.  Like TCNs, these initial Iraqi refugees </p><p>would be screened at the staging facility on the </p><p>Iraqi-Jordanian border and moved to the camps at Ruweished. </p><p>However, General Al Eitan made clear the GOJ would not accept </p><p>into Jordan "bad" Iraqis -- former members of the military or </p><p>otherwise suspect Iraqis -- and would instead hold them at </p><p>the screening center and possibly the stage two camp at </p><p>Nadayim airbase.  Fourth, the GOJ believes the estimated up </p><p>to 100,000 Palestinians resident in Iraq could seek to enter </p><p>Jordan in the event of hostilities in Iraq.  Al Eitan </p><p>confirmed that the GOJ would not allow Palestinians to enter </p><p>Jordan, telling emboffs that Jordan "suffered a lot" from the </p><p>1990-91 influx of Palestinians from the Gulf and is not </p><p>prepared to accept a similar influx.  The GOJ therefore plans </p><p>to hold the Palestinians at the screening center on the </p><p>Iraqi-Jordanian border and would facilitate assistance to </p><p>Palestinians only in that area.  Al Eitan added that the GOJ </p><p>believes most Palestinians resident in Iraq are without any </p><p>papers -- UNRWA registration or Iraqi travel documents. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>GOJ Requests USD 70 Million in Support </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (S) General Al Eitan confirmed that the GOJ is in the </p><p>process of negotiating an MOU with UNHCR to delineate </p><p>responsibilities and, most importantly from the GOJ\'s </p><p>perspective, secure financial assistance for humanitarian </p><p>assistance provided by the GOJ.  According to Al Eitan, the </p><p>GOJ has estimated its humanitarian expenditures at 51 million </p><p>JD (approx USD 70 million).  15 million JD (USD 21 million) </p><p>are required to set up the staging ground at the </p><p>Iraqi-Jordanian border, two camps inside Jordan at Ruweished, </p><p>a later camp on the Iraqi side of the border, and a military </p><p>headquarters in the field.  Al Eitan confirmed that the 51 </p><p>million JD covers anticipated military and civilian </p><p>expenditures and said emboffs could obtain a detailed </p><p>breakdown of anticipated GOJ costs from the Ministry of </p><p>Planning.  (Comment:  From Al Eitan\'s brief description of </p><p>the services the GOJ is prepared to provide, the GOJ appears </p><p>to have thought through important logistical issues such as </p><p>water (the JAF has requested six desalination units and </p><p>accompanying water tankers) and health care (one JAF field </p><p>hospital has been assigned for refugee assistance) and </p><p>transport.  Yet the GOJ also appears to seek compensation for </p><p>development projects such as water pipelines, sewerage </p><p>systems and electricity grids.  Army Attache will obtain a </p><p>more detailed list of JAF assistance plans, and USAID Mission </p><p>Director and Refcoord will meet with the Minister of Planning </p><p>January 13 to obtain the GOJ\'s detailed financial request.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p>UNHCR\'s Perspective:  Progress but Financial Hurdles Remain </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (S) In a one-on-one meeting following a January 9 donor </p><p>briefing, UNHCR Representative Sten Bronee confirmed to </p><p>refcoord that the GOJ had agreed to accept Iraqi refugees </p><p>inside Jordanian borders.  In order to protect GOJ political </p><p>equities, UNHCR has agreed that the camps at Ruweished will </p><p>not be for "refugees" but will be for "displaced people" with </p><p>the understanding that this group would include Iraqi </p><p>refugees.  Bronee commented that the GOJ seems to have </p><p>realized it could have a huge public relations disaster if it </p><p>is caught unprepared with several thousand Iraqi asylum </p><p>seekers on its border.  However, the GOJ also wants to make </p><p>sure it has financial support from the international </p><p>community, as it feels that it was "burned" by providing </p><p>services without compensation during the 1990-1991 refugee </p><p>crisis.  Bronee said the GOJ has asked the UN for guarantees </p><p>that it will be reimbursed for all refugee-related expenses. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (S) Not surprisingly, UNHCR\'s MOU negotiations with the </p><p>GOJ have snagged over GOJ financial requests.  Dismissing the </p><p>GOJ\'s 51 million JD figures as "enough to build an Olympic </p><p>city," Bronee said he needed a "reasonable and credible </p><p>budget" before UNHCR could sign the MOU.  Bronee added that </p><p>UNHCR will not pay for development projects, such as </p><p>high-quality electrical infrastructure or permanent </p><p>hospitals.  Bronee asked the USG to weigh in with the GOJ on </p><p>the need to provide detailed, credible financial figures, </p><p>hinting that perhaps bilateral donors might be prepared to </p><p>finance development projects that the GOJ wanted to complete </p><p>in conjunction with refugee assistance. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (S) Bronee did not report any of his discussions with </p><p>the GOJ in the broader donor briefing.  Instead, he reported </p><p>only that the UN is preparing to provide assistance to "large </p><p>number of displaced people at the Iraqi-Jordanian border." </p><p>While the UN "hopes" that the GOJ will be able to provide </p><p>assistance, Bronee said that the GOJ "is not in a position to </p><p>say so at this time."  Echoing comments made by Minister of </p><p>State for Foreign Affairs Shaher Bak, Bronee later told </p><p>refcoord the GOJ is unlikely to change its public position </p><p>"until the very last minute." </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>UNHCR Prepositioning Complete </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (SBU) At the January 9 donor briefing, Bronee announced </p><p>that with GOJ authorization, UNHCR had prepositioned non-food </p><p>stocks (tents, plastic sheeting, kerosene heaters, cooking </p><p>sets, blankets, etc) for 36,000 at a warehouse in Aqaba.  The </p><p>stocks would be used to respond to refugee flows in/toward </p><p>Jordan and/or Syria.  UNHCR also has secured 8600 square </p><p>meters of additional warehouse space in Amman.  Bronee noted </p><p>that overall UNHCR planning figures for the region have not </p><p>changed:  600,000 refugees distributed among Iran, Turkey, </p><p>Syria, Jordan and Kuwait.  Bronee made a strong pitch for </p><p>funding, telling donors that of the USD 60 million required </p><p>to preposition supplies and respond to initial refugee flows, </p><p>UNHCR had received only USD 16 million -- 6 million from the </p><p>UN\'s CERF and 10 million from UNHCR\'s emergency fund -- all </p><p>of which must be paid back. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>Comment and Action Requests </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  (S) The GOJ\'s apparent decision to allow Iraqi refugees </p><p>to enter Jordan in the event of hostilities in Iraq </p><p>represents an important practical change from previous GOJ </p><p>policy and contrasts with continuing public GOJ statements </p><p>which insist that GOJ borders will remain closed.  Given GOJ </p><p>sensitivities on refugee questions (including its steadfast </p><p>refusal to allow large number of West Bank Palestinians to </p><p>enter Jordan), as well as its very real desire to limit the </p><p>number of Iraqi asylum seekers in Jordan, we do not expect </p><p>the GOJ\'s public posture to change "until the very last </p><p>minute."  Nevertheless, this change in GOJ policy poses new </p><p>questions for USG humanitarian planning, such as whether an </p><p>even partially open border would attract a greater flow of </p><p>refugees toward Jordan.  If so, this argues more strongly for </p><p>a DART team to be positioned in Jordan.  In order to sort out </p><p>these questions, Embassy Amman would welcome a visit by a </p><p>senior member(s) of the USG\'s Humanitarian Planning Team, to </p><p>assess UN, IO and GOJ capabilities and to explain in greater </p><p>detail the assistance the USG could offer. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (S) Finally, from both a humanitarian and political </p><p>perspective, we are concerned by two key GOJ planning </p><p>assumptions.  First, the GOJ made it clear that refugees </p><p>would be admitted to camps in Ruweished only in the initial </p><p>stages of conflict.  The GOJ did not clarify what it intended </p><p>to do with Iraqi refugees resident in Ruweished after the </p><p>second-stage camp would be established at Nadayim airbase in </p><p>Iraq and seems to have hinted that they would be granted only </p><p>temporary admission to Jordan.  We will seek clarification of </p><p>this policy and remind the GOJ of our non-refoulment </p><p>concerns.  Second, we question whether the GOJ will be able </p><p>to sustain its categorical refusal to admit Palestinians </p><p>resident in Iraq.  We also are concerned that Palestinians </p><p>resident in Iraq -- without UNRWA documentation or any other </p><p>documents to establish their claims to UNRWA status -- could </p><p>fall through the cracks of the UN refugee system.  Although </p><p>ICRC Jordan Delegate Guy Mellet had previously indicated the </p><p>ICRC would be prepared to provide assistance to stateless </p><p>Palestinians displaced as the result of hostilities in Iraq, </p><p>we request that Geneva clarify this policy at the appropriate </p><p>time. </p><p>BERRY </p><p></p></div>
