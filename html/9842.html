The judge also issued an arrest </p><p>warrant for 5 members of the Uzan family.  According to the </p><p>court, Motorola and Nokia transferred $2.7 billion to </p><p>Telsim, which was owned by the Uzans.  The Uzan family spent </p><p>$1billion of this money for their personal use. The judge </p><p>ordered the Uzans to transfer their Telsim shares to the </p><p>registry of the court within one week.  Meanwhile, another </p><p>blow against the Uzans came from Turkey.  Through a last- </p><p>minute adjustment in the banking law, a bank\'s owners will </p><p>be personally responsible for any differences between </p><p>official bank records and the records of bank customers. </p><p>"Sabah" draws attention to the fact that the new regulation </p><p>will allow the government to seize all of the Uzans\' </p><p>property in order to claim the money deposited illegally in </p><p>Imar Bank. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Higher Military Council (YAS) Meeting: "Hurriyet" reports </p><p>that today\'s meeting of the High Military Council (YAS) has </p><p>been overshadowed by the headscarf of PM Erdogan\'s wife. </p><p>Dinners are traditionally given by the General Staff Land </p><p>Forces commander and by the Prime Minister during the course </p><p>of the four-day meeting.   The commanders reportedly </p><p>canceled the two dinners to avoid the participation of the </p><p>PM\'s wife, who wears a headscarf.  "Milliyet" reports that </p><p>the generals canceled only the dinner traditionally given by </p><p>the Prime Minister on the second day of the meetings.  The </p><p>Prime Minister is expected to participate in all the other </p><p>events by himself. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Troop Deployment: "Hurriyet" reports that at parliament </p><p>speaker Arinc\'s reception, Foreign Minister Gul told </p><p>journalists that `Turkey has not reached a decision yet </p><p>about a troop deployment in Iraq.\'  Gul noted that Turkey </p><p>does not want to act as a `gendarme\' for the United States </p><p>in Iraq.  According to Gul, Turkey wants to go to Iraq if </p><p>Turkish troops will be welcomed by the Iraqis as they were </p><p>in Bosnia.  Turkish inteliigence officers are studying what </p><p>kind of welcome Turkish forces are likely to receive in </p><p>Iraq.  Todays papers also report on British envoy John </p><p>Sawers\' visit to Ankara.  Sawers told  journalists that the </p><p>UK would welcome the deployment of Turkish troops in Iraq. </p><p>CHP Defections: Two parliamentary deputies have resigned </p><p>from the CHP in the past two days, after a disagreement with </p><p>the CHP leadership about the party\'s opposition to the </p><p>repentance law.  The deputies, both of whom are Kurdish, </p><p>criticized their party\'s `anti-democratic\' tendencies. </p><p>"Sabah" reports that three CHP provincial chairmen in the </p><p>Southeast strongly criticized Baykal for his opposition to </p><p>the repentance law. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EU Welcomes 7th package:  Papers report that the EU has </p><p>welcomed the approval of Turkey\'s 7th package of EU </p><p>harmonization reforms.  Turkey\'s EU General Secretary. Murat </p><p>Sungar, noted that the package was passed by the government </p><p>despite the objections of the Turkish military.  EU </p><p>expansion chief Verheugen said that the EU `expects Turkey </p><p>to actively implement all reforms that have been passed.\' </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"A Kurdish state if Iraq disintegrates" </p><p>Mehmet Ali Birand commented in the mass appeal Posta (8/1): </p><p>"Kenneth Pollack, a leading expert on Iraq, predicts that </p><p>the Kurds might declare sovereignty if the confusion in Iraq </p><p>evolves into a civil war. .  The U.S., struggling to handle </p><p>such a chaotic situation, might not do anything to hold back </p><p>the Kurds. .  Despite his negative views of the Bush </p><p>administration, Pollack believes Turkey should send </p><p>peacekeeping troops to Iraq. .  Washington has understood </p><p>that fighting with Turkey over differences on Iraq will not </p><p>be beneficial.  The U.S. has seen the need to share the </p><p>responsibility in Iraq with other countries, and now wants </p><p>to turn a new page in its relations with Turkey.  Pollack </p><p>notes that the Bush administration was successful in </p><p>toppling Saddam quickly, but believes that Washington failed </p><p>in planning for the post-war period." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"War is bad, but what about occupation?" </p><p>Erdal Guven wrote in the intellectual/opinion-maker Radikal </p><p>(8/1): "Compared with the period before the rejection of the </p><p>March 1 decree, the current situation in Iraq is worse for </p><p>Turkey.  You cannot find a reasonable explanation for </p><p>sending troops to an occupied land from a country that had </p><p>denied military access to its soil during the Iraqi </p><p>campaign. .  Sending troops for peacekeeping in Iraq will </p><p>erase all the credit Turkey won worldwide by its March 1 </p><p>decision.  Ankara is playing a dangerous game once again." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEUTSCH </p><p></p></div>
