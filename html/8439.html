<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001113 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PDPA DALTON, MITCHELL AND SIMS AND AF/S RAYNOR </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION MASS ACTION IN ZIM; HARARE </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Editorials in the mainstream media remain sharply </p><p>      divided over the implications of the week-long </p><p>      national protests organized by the opposition </p><p>      Movement of Democratic Change (MDC) to pressure </p><p>      Robert Mugabe to the negotiating table.  While the </p><p>      independent media is hailing the five-day strike, </p><p>      which began on June 2 by completely shutting down </p><p>      all commercial and industrial activity in Harare and </p><p>      other major cities, as a welcome move to show the </p><p>      country\'s displeasure at Robert Mugabe\'s leadership, </p><p>      the government-controlled press continues to clamor </p><p>      for the incarceration of MDC leader Morgan </p><p>      Tsvangirai.  Editorial excerpts follow: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   Under headline "The people\'s loud and clear voice" the </p><p>      independent daily "The Daily News" (06/03) comments: </p><p> </p><p>      ". . .But the stunning shutdown of the entire </p><p>      nation, with the capital Harare eerily deserted and </p><p>      resembling a ghost town, dramatically and </p><p>      graphically underlined who now calls the shots in </p><p>      the power stakes in Zimbabwe.  The overwhelming </p><p>      response of Zimbabweans to stay put at home after </p><p>      dire threats from the government that it would crush </p><p>      the protests showed that, while the administration </p><p>      had possibly won this phase of the battle, it had </p><p>      significantly lost the war.  The nationwide shutdown </p><p>      dramatized in no uncertain terms. . .that the people </p><p>      will no longer be cowed and that people power is now </p><p>      on the ascendancy. . .All signals point to one </p><p>      certainty: freedom is coming tomorrow." </p><p> </p><p>  3.   Under headline "Tsvangirai must face full wrath of </p><p>      law" the government-controlled daily "The Herald" (06/03) </p><p>      comments: </p><p> </p><p>       "It is Julius Caesar who is famed for saying, `If </p><p>       you must break the law do it once to seize power. </p><p>       Otherwise you must obey it.\'  The MDC leader, Morgan </p><p>       Tsvangirai, and his supporters followed Caesar\'s </p><p>       advice and broke the law yesterday but failed to </p><p>       seize power.  They now face the full wrath of the </p><p>       law. . .According to the MDC, this was a make-or- </p><p>       break demonstration and its gamble has fallen flat </p><p>       on its face as the ZANU-PF government has clearly </p><p>       shown that it has both the might and the will to </p><p>       resist such silly machinations. . .As we have stated </p><p>       before, no amount of force will stop a genuine </p><p>       uprising by the majority of the people against any </p><p>       government if there was a real </p><p>       cause. . .It is, therefore, important for Tsvangirai </p><p>       to note that he cannot manufacture an uprising and </p><p>       no amount of money can buy him the people\'s support. </p><p>       This is why his paid demonstrators could not stand- </p><p>       up to their convictions when confronted by the law </p><p>       enforcement agents. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
