(U) Local press reported on April 13 that the </p><p>Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs issued more than </p><p>32,000 employee labor cards and 12,000 work permits to </p><p>companies last month.  Approximately 60% of the cards </p><p>were new and there was also a "sizeable increase" in </p><p>the issuance of group visas.  The majority of </p><p>issuances were in the construction and maintenance </p><p>industries. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) Tariq bin Deemas, head of the work permits </p><p>department at the Ministry, stated that the increase </p><p>in visas was related to the industrial growth and </p><p>urban development of the UAE, and the expansion of the </p><p>workforce is meant to create "massive economic </p><p>development." </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Comment: Though the UAE is currently </p><p>conducting a well-publicized Amnesty Program to </p><p>regulate and stabilize the labor market by forcing </p><p>marginal and ineffective manpower to leave the </p><p>country, this report suggests that the country is not </p><p>yet ready to abandon its long-standing reliance on </p><p>large numbers of cheap expatriate workers. (See refs A </p><p>and D).  The Ministry recently announced that almost </p><p>27% of the total labor force that came to the UAE in </p><p>the last few years entered under false work contracts </p><p>and that only 49% of registered businesses in the </p><p>country were legitimate.  (See ref B).  By continuing </p><p>to issue new labor cards and increase group visas in a </p><p>period of economic stagnation, reform of the labor </p><p>market is taking a backseat role to the continuing </p><p>exploitation of the visa/sponsorship process whereby </p><p>many Emiratis -- especially from the poorer northern </p><p>Emirates -- derive significant financial gain.  (See </p><p>ref C). </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
