Under headline "First duty of army, police is to the </p><p>      nation" the independent daily "The Daily News" dedicated </p><p>      its May 30 editorial to urging Zimbabwe\'s uniformed forces </p><p>      not to use strong-arm tactics against demonstrators who may </p><p>      participate in next week\'s possible anti-government </p><p>      protests.  Zimbabwe\'s main opposition party, the Movement </p><p>      for Democratic Change (MDC), has called for a week-long </p><p>      series of marches and protests aimed at forcing Robert </p><p>      Mugabe to step down.  These protests are slated to begin on </p><p>      June 2.  Editorial excerpts follow: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   ". . .The first duty of members of the army and the </p><p>      police, whatever their orders, is to the people of </p><p>      Zimbabwe, regardless of their political affiliations.  They </p><p>      cannot and must not side with tyranny.  History will not </p><p>      look kindly on those State security agents who lose sight </p><p>      of this fact." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
