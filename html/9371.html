<p>S E C R E T ROME 003199 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR A/RPS/IPS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/11/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINR, IT, FAA, AVIATION </p><p>SUBJECT: USTICA CRASH BACK IN THE HEADLINES: REQUEST FOR </p><p>INFO </p><p> </p><p>REF: ROME 2887 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: POLITICAL MINISTER COUNSELOR THOMAS COUNTRYMAN FOR REASO </p><p>    NS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) THIS IS AN ACTION REQUEST.  PLEASE SEE PARA 5. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) THIRTY ITALIAN PARLIAMENTARIANS HAVE SIGNED A </p><p>RESOLUTION CALLING ON THE GOI TO OFFICIALLY PROTEST TO THE </p><p>STATE DEPARTMENT FOR "SPYING" ON THE ITALIAN PM AND MOD IN </p><p>1992, ACCORDING TO CARLO GIOVANARDI, MINISTER FOR RELATIONS </p><p>WITH PARLIAMENT.  GIOVANARDI TOLD POL MC AT A  JULY 10 </p><p>MEETING THAT THE RESOLUTION LAMENTS THE USG\'S "LACK OF </p><p>CLARITY AND COOPERATION" WITH THE GOI ON THE 1980 USTICA </p><p>CRASH CASE.  GIOVANARDI SHOWED POL MC THE JUNE 21 TG3 TV </p><p>REPORTAGE ALLEGING THAT THE USG INTERCEPTED IN 1992 A PHONE </p><p>CALL BETWEEN PM GIULIANO AMATO AND MOD SALVO ANDRO WHILE THE </p><p>GOI WAS DECIDING WHETHER TO BECOME A PLAINTIFF IN THE USTICA </p><p>CASE (REFTEL).  THE TV REPORT CLAIMED THAT THE INTERCEPTED </p><p>PHONE CALL WAS MENTIONED IN DOCUMENTS THE STATE DEPARTMENT </p><p>RELEASED TO USTICA VICTIMS\' RELATIVES PURSUANT TO A FREEDOM </p><p>OF INFORMATION ACT REQUEST. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) GIOVANARDI EXPLAINED THAT, A YEAR AGO, HE SPOKE IN </p><p>PARLIAMENT TRYING TO PUT THE 20- YEAR OLD USTICA CRASH CASE </p><p>TO REST.  HE FAVORED THE EXPLANATION THAT THE CRASH WAS </p><p>CAUSED BY AN INTERNAL EXPLOSION AND NOT BY A US MISSILE. </p><p>THESE NEW ALLEGATIONS UNDERMINE HIS CREDIBILITY, HE SAID.  HE </p><p>MUST SPEAK AGAIN ON THE CASE IN A PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEE </p><p>HEARING ON THE OPPOSITION MOTION BEFORE THE END OF JULY.  HE </p><p>ASKED POL MC FOR THE DOCUMENTS ALLEGEDLY RELEASED BY THE </p><p>DEPARTMENT TO THE VICTIMS\' FAMILIES IN ORDER TO BE PREPARED </p><p>TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE AGAIN IN PARLIAMENT, AND ASKED THAT WE </p><p>COORDINATE OUR PUBLIC COMMENT ON THE MATTER. </p><p></p><p>4. (C) COMMENT : GIOVANARDI AND POL MC AGREED THAT THE TG3 </p><p>REPORTAGE PRESENTED NO NEW EVIDENCE ON THE USTICA CRASH </p><p>ITSELF, AND INCLUDES NOTHING THAT WOULD DISPROVE WHAT </p><p>GIOVANARDI BRIEFED TO THE PARLIAMENT OR WHAT WE HAVE ALWAYS </p><p>SAID: THAT THERE WAS NO USG INVOLVEMENT IN THE CRASH.  THE </p><p>PROGRAM DID RAISE NEW ALLEGATIONS OF "ESPIONAGE" BY THE USG, </p><p>HOWEVER, AND IMPLIED THAT THE USG MUST HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN </p><p>THE USTICA CRASH AND "COVER-UP" OR IT WOULD NOT HAVE "SPIED" </p><p>ON SENIOR GOI CONVERSATIONS REGARDING THE CASE.  POST NEEDS </p><p>TO REVIEW THE DOCUMENTS REFERRED TO IN THE PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>INQUIRY AND THE TV PROGRAM IN ORDER TO BE FULLY INFORMED (OR </p><p>AT LEAST AS INFORMED AS THOSE MAKING THE ACCUSATIONS). </p><p>EMBASSY DOES NOT INTEND TO COMMENT PUBLICLY ON THE NEW </p><p>ALLEGATION, BUT IF THE ALLEGATION IS NOT SUPPORTED BY THE </p><p>DOCUMENTS THEMSELVES, THEN WE WOULD BE ABLE TO HELP </p><p>GIOVANARDI FEND OFF THE OPPOSITION\'S MOTION.  GIVEN THE </p><p>VOLATILE CONSPIRACY THEORY TENDANCIES THAT STUBBORNLY </p><p>SURROUND THE USTICA INCIDENT, WE WOULD PREFER NOT TO HAVE TO </p><p>ASK THE VICTIMS\' FAMILIES FOR COPIES OF INTERNAL STATE </p><p>DEPARTMENT DOCUMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) ACTION REQUEST: WE REALIZE THE MAGNITUDE OF THE TASK </p><p>OF LOCATING PARTICULAR DOCUMENTS FROM THOUSANDS RELEASED </p><p>UNDER FOIA, AND WE GREATLY APPRECIATE THE EFFORT A/RPS/IPS </p><p>HAS ALREADY PUT IN TO REFTEL REQUEST.  THE ONLY ADDITIONAL </p><p>INFORMATION WE CAN PROVIDE, HAVING NOW VIEWED THE VIDEOTAPE, </p><p>IS THAT THE DOCUMENT CITED HAS THE APPEARANCE OF A STATE </p><p>CABLE (POSSIBLY EXDIS OR NODIS), RATHER THAN AN INTELLIGENCE </p><p>PRODUCT.  THE ONLY IDENTIFYING DATA WE COULD SEE ON THE ONE </p><p>PAGE SHOWN WAS WHAT APPEARED TO BE A CABLE NUMBER "0467" AND </p><p>    A DTG "161624Z" (MONTH INDISTINCT).  WE AGAIN REQUEST THE </p><p>DEPARTMENT\'S MOST RAPID ASSISTANCE WITH IDENTIFYING THE </p><p>DOCUMENTS RELEASED PURSUANT TO THE FOIA REQUEST.  END COMMENT </p><p>AND ACTION REQUEST. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p> 2003ROME03199 - Classification: SECRET </p><p></p><p></p></div>
