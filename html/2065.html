<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 002622 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/15/2006 </p><p>TAGS: ASEC, PREL, PHUM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: VIOLENCE ERUPTS IN KANO, ELSWHERE CALM </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter; Reasons 1.5 (b) & </p><p>(d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary: Violence erupted in Kano over the October </p><p>12-14 weekend for a </p><p>multiplicity of reasons, chiefly criminal opportunism and </p><p>internal political </p><p>rivalries but also including anti-U.S. sentiment over air </p><p>strikes against the </p><p>Taliban and bin Laden.  Twenty-five people were killed, over </p><p>200 were arrested </p><p>and numerous buildings (mostly shops) were damaged and </p><p>looted, according to a </p><p>reliable GON source.  (Some other sources claim a death toll </p><p>exceeding 100.) </p><p>The source reports that Kano is quiet but tense.  The </p><p>military remains in </p><p>control of security.  This violent scrum is evidence of the </p><p>febrile air </p><p>hovering over parts of Northern Nigeria.  While the military </p><p>may provide the </p><p>short-term fix, the Obasanjo Administration will have to ply </p><p>a sagacious poli </p><p>tical strategy to minimize tension or this type of eruption </p><p>will be a recurrent </p><p>theme. Amcits are safe and none were reportedly caught up in </p><p>any of the </p><p>clashes. End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>PEACEFUL MARCH, VIOLENT AFTERMATH </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) After Juma\'at prayers October 11, a planned </p><p>demonstration of 500-600 </p><p>protestors, apparently affiliated with the Muslim </p><p>Brotherhood, left the Central </p><p>Mosque, reportedly chanting anti-U.S. and pro-Bin Laden </p><p>slogans.  They burned </p><p>U.S. flags as well as pictures of President Bush and Foreign </p><p>Minister Lamido </p><p>who, earlier this week, issued the official GON public </p><p>statement supporting </p><p>U.S. air strikes in Afghanistan.  The protestors attempted to </p><p>march towards </p><p>Sabon Gari, Kano\'s predominantly Christian section, but were </p><p>thwarted by </p><p>police.  By 6 PM, the group dispersed without serious </p><p>incident.  (Comment: </p><p>Sparks likely would have flown had the procession reached </p><p>Sabon Gari. </p><p>Demonstrators knew the potential repercussions of heading in </p><p>that area - </p><p>indicating they were not averse to confrontation.  End </p><p>Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) Around midnight, roughly six hours after the march </p><p>had ended, two small </p><p>churches were burned on Kano\'s outskirts.  Around ten a.m. on </p><p>Saturday, a large </p><p>mob of Muslim "area boys," started toward Kano\'s largest </p><p>market, which lies on </p><p>the edge of Sabon Gari.  Both Christian and Muslim </p><p>shopkeepers attempted to </p><p>defend their shops, according to Rev. Zakka Nyam, the </p><p>Anglican Archbishop if </p><p>Kano.  Nyam stated that the thugs did not push into Sabon </p><p>Gari even though two </p><p>mosques in Sabon Gari were burned in retaliation for the </p><p>earlier church arson. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) By 3 p.m., with the police unable to stifle the </p><p>melee, the military </p><p>arrived to restore order.  The military\'s use of live </p><p>ammunition eventually </p><p>dispersed the mob. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) After contacting several GON sources and eminent </p><p>people in Kano, Rev. </p><p>Obaje, Chaplain at the Presidential Villa and Chairman of </p><p>Nigeria\'s </p><p>Inter-Religious Council, told Ambassador Jeter October 14 </p><p>that Kano was quiet </p><p>but tense.  By the time the unrest subsided, 25 people had </p><p>died, many more were </p><p>wounded, over 200 had been arrested and dozens of shops and </p><p>cars had been </p><p>damaged.  The VOA stringer in Kano, Ahmed Kuablar, confirmed </p><p>the extensive </p><p>property damage to Poloff, but estimated a death toll </p><p>exceeding 100, far beyond </p><p>the GON figure.  How many casualties resulted from the </p><p>military intervention </p><p>and the ethnic/religious proportions of the casualty count </p><p>are currently </p><p>unknown. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>WHY DID IT HAPPEN? </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) There is no consensus as to what precipitated the </p><p>rioting. Rev. Obaje </p><p>informed us that many of the arrested were recently imported </p><p>to Kano from </p><p>Zamfara and Minna.  Some claimed their trips to Kano were </p><p>subsidized. </p><p>Rev. Obaje saw an evil scheme afoot and former Head-of-State </p><p>Babangida as its </p><p>author.  Babangida, he inveighed, would venture to extreme </p><p>lengths to discredit </p><p>Obasanjo in the North, and keep Obasanjo\'s Administration </p><p>"off balance".  Rev. </p><p>Obaje contended that the disruption was not directed against </p><p>the United </p><p>States.  He believed Babangida had shipped in ruffians from </p><p>outside as well as </p><p>funneled money to Kano\'s militant fundamentalists so they </p><p>could incite the area </p><p>boys. Obaje complained that Zamfara Governor Sani contributed </p><p>to the tumult be </p><p>cause of his political blood feud with NSA Aliyu Mohammed, a </p><p>native of </p><p>Zamfara.  Rev. Obaje said Mohammed had been trying to </p><p>engineer Sani\'s </p><p>impeachment by the Zamfara State Assembly.  Once Sani got </p><p>wind of the NSA\'s </p><p>intrigue, the governor has gone into full rebellion, </p><p>believing Mohammed\'s antics bore Obasanjo\'s imprimatur.  Sani </p><p>wanted to see Kano ignite, giving Mohammed and, by extension, </p><p>the Federal Government a taste of their own machinations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) Other observers saw the destruction as nothing but </p><p>opportunism devoid </p><p>of any religious or political content.  Rev. Nyam, Kano\'s </p><p>Anglican Archbishop, </p><p>stated the rioting was criminally motivated and not the </p><p>product of ethnic or </p><p>religious difference. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) The truth probably lies somewhere between these two </p><p>contending </p><p>positions.  Not surprisingly, the President\'s Chaplain would </p><p>demonize Babangida </p><p>and Sani, two of his chief\'s most chronic political </p><p>migraines.  Meanwhile, </p><p>Nyan\'s verdict of pure criminality is too facile and </p><p>simplistic. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) An Amcit in Kano reported that the days before the </p><p>outbreak, Bin Laden </p><p>posters had appeared throughout Kano.  Groups of young men </p><p>could be seen </p><p>huddled together on street corners praising Bin Laden. Others </p><p>were passing out </p><p>pro-Bin Laden literature or his picture.  One in every four </p><p>vehicles plying </p><p>Kano\'s streets had Bin Laden\'s picture in the rear window. </p><p>Clearly there was </p><p>significant sympathy for Bin Laden, probably born of long </p><p>held resentment </p><p>toward the United States and as a show of Islamic solidarity. </p><p>As we have </p><p>reported before, there is widespread perception in some areas </p><p>of the North that </p><p>predate September 11, that the United States is both </p><p>anti-North and anti-Islamic </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) Conditions in Kano are too complex to attribute the </p><p>riot to a single </p><p>cause.  Kano, a city of millions and Nigeria\'s largest </p><p>predominantly Muslim </p><p>one, has large swaths of people living in abject poverty. </p><p>While their penury </p><p>may be a socio-economic affliction, some view the world and </p><p>their condition in </p><p>it through a religious prism.  For them, their poverty is the </p><p>product of an </p><p>unholy, unjust system of which the United States sits at the </p><p>pinnacle.  There </p><p>are several militant clerics, many externally financed </p><p>"cultural organizations" </p><p>and some fundamentalist cells who feed this anti-U.S. gruel </p><p>to the disaffected, </p><p>particularly the street youth.  In their twisted cosmology, </p><p>their criminal acts </p><p>are legitimate political and religious behavior.  This </p><p>radicalism makes Kano </p><p>more susceptible to sporadic turbulence than most other </p><p>Nigerian cities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) Our operation in Afghanistan aggravated a </p><p>pre-existing condition in </p><p>the city.  While criminality, poverty, and local political </p><p>machinations </p><p>probably played the much larger role, that the disturbance </p><p>occurred after </p><p>Friday prayers and after the anti-U.S. march was probably not </p><p>coincidental. </p><p>Anti-U.S. sentiment and religious militancy were lesser, </p><p>junior partners in this </p><p>eruption.  Fortunately, GON security gained control before </p><p>the situation </p><p>worsened.  Thus far, there are no reports of violence </p><p>spreading to other </p><p>Northern cities.  While deployment of the military may </p><p>squelch turbulence in </p><p>the short-term, the GON will have to develop a political </p><p>strategy that begins </p><p>to neutralize the radicalism currently residing in pockets of </p><p>the North.  If </p><p>not, President Obasanjo will continually face these periodic </p><p>eruptions that </p><p>blemish his stewardship and undermine Nigeria\'s quest for </p><p>social stability </p><p>based on ethno-religious tolerance. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
