<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 004358 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EB/CBED, EB/ESC, EUR/SE </p><p>NSC FOR QUANRUD AND BRYZA </p><p>USDOC FOR 4212/ITA/MAC/OEURA/DDEFALCO </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA - MILLS AND LEICHTER </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ENRG, EINV, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR\'S FAREWELL CALL ON ENERGY MINISTER GULER </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  Summary:  In his July 9 farewell call on Energy </p><p>Minister Guler, Ambassador highlighted the importance of </p><p>continued cooperation in developing the East-West Energy </p><p>Corridor and stressed that Turkey\'s ability to attract </p><p>foreign investment into its domestic energy market will </p><p>depend heavily on how it treats existing investors.  Guler, </p><p>who emphasized his commitment to the bilateral relationship, </p><p>spoke very positively on the BTC and Shah Deniz pipelines. </p><p>He complained that his Ministry is faced with correcting the </p><p>mistakes of the past several years, including the signing of </p><p>numerous expensive energy contracts.  He agreed on the need </p><p>to attract foreign investors into the domestic energy market, </p><p>and insisted that he would try to resolve the issues </p><p>surrounding the existing BOT contracts in a positive manner. </p><p>He noted that Turkey\'s dispute with Russia, specifically </p><p>Gazprom, over Blue Stream gas is based on a disagreement over </p><p>the pricing formula; Gazprom\'s CEO was to arrive in Turkey </p><p>July 10 to discuss.  Guler suggested Turkey would be </p><p>interested in using Iraqi natural gas to produce electricity, </p><p>which could be transferred back to Iraq.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  Ambassador began his July 9 farewell call on </p><p>Energy and Natural Resources Minister Hilmi Guler by </p><p>expressing satisfaction with the close and successful </p><p>bilateral cooperation over the past three years in developing </p><p>the East-West Energy Corridor.  He reiterated the strong USG </p><p>support for the BTC and Shah Deniz pipelines, and solicited </p><p>the Minister\'s views on the areas on which he and the new </p><p>Ambassador might cooperate. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Minister Guler responded by affirming his strong </p><p>personal commitment to the bilateral relationship, and </p><p>expressed hope the close working relationship he has enjoyed </p><p>with the Ambassador would continue.  He said both the BTC and </p><p>Shah Deniz projects were on track, and that he was in regular </p><p>contact with Ambassador Mann.  The Minister said the </p><p>government was working to make up for lost time on BTC </p><p>construction, and was optimistic that Greece and other EU </p><p>members were interested in buying Shah Deniz gas.  Those </p><p>countries had asked to buy Iranian gas through Turkey pending </p><p>Shah Deniz\'s completion, but Guler -- aware of U.S. concerns </p><p>-- had declined. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) The Minister complained that he faced enormous </p><p>problems in correcting the mistakes of the past decade, </p><p>during which one political party (ANAP) had controlled </p><p>Turkish energy policy.  During that period, the GOT had </p><p>signed a series of costly contracts, domestic and </p><p>international, that were based on misinformation, </p><p>miscalculations, or erroneous assessments of demand.  Now, </p><p>the government had to try to attract foreign investment into </p><p>the domestic energy market, while correcting those past </p><p>mistakes. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Guler argued that the GOT\'s recent seizure of </p><p>energy assets controlled by the Uzan family should send a </p><p>clear message to foreign investors that the government is </p><p>working seriously to improve the investment environment. The </p><p>GOT is also trying to streamline bureaucratic procedures </p><p>facing foreign investors.  On the existing BOT projects, he </p><p>insisted that "we are not after their profits."  Rather, he </p><p>said, the Ministry is trying to review the contracts so that, </p><p>from now on, the government and the companies are "on the </p><p>same line."  His goal is to solve the problems associated </p><p>with these contracts in a low-key, positive way. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) Ambassador welcomed the Minister\'s comments but </p><p>warned that, if the government failed to handle the existing </p><p>BOT contracts properly, it would be virtually impossible to </p><p>attract new foreign investment into the sector, particularly </p><p>from U.S. companies.  He urged Guler to handle the issue in a </p><p>way that enhanced investor perceptions of the investment </p><p>environment.  Guler agreed, but said that the Turkish partner </p><p>in one of the companies (Doga) was spreading false rumors </p><p>about the government\'s approach to hide its own contract </p><p>violations (involving misuse of natural gas intended for </p><p>electricity production).  He invited Ambassador to send him </p><p>in writing a list of any specific problems U.S. companies are </p><p>facing (which Embassy is doing). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) Guler noted that the CEO of Gazprom would visit </p><p>July 10 to try to resolve a dispute over Blue Stream gas. </p><p>The Minister explained that the issue involves the price </p><p>formula.  The Russians assert that the formula in the </p><p>contract is wrong -- the result of a misprint -- and are </p><p>insisting that it be changed.  The change, per Guler, would </p><p>result in a price increase of $20-30 per thousand cubic </p><p>meters, against which the Russians are offering a $3-4 </p><p>discount.  Guler said the GOT was confident the price formula </p><p>in the contract was correct, noting that it was identical to </p><p>that used in the contract for the Russia West pipeline. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) The Minister expressed hope that Turkey\'s relations </p><p>with Iraq would develop, and -- in a surprise move -- </p><p>suggested Turkey would be interested in starting a natural </p><p>gas trade with Iraq.  He explained that Turkey could import </p><p>Iraqi natural gas, use it to generate electricity, and then </p><p>sell the electricity back to Iraq or to other neighboring </p><p>countries.  Alternatively, Turkey might be able to turn the </p><p>natural gas into LPG for export to other markets.  He </p><p>expressed an interest in forming a consortium with U.S. </p><p>companies to pursue this idea. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU) Ambassador said he would pass on the Minister\'s </p><p>idea, and also took the opportunity to thank the Minister for </p><p>meeting with the U.S. company Universal Ensco, which is </p><p>seeking a contract to oversee part of the BTC pipeline\'s </p><p>construction.  He suggested that concrete actions by the GOT </p><p>on commercial issues would do much to justify additional U.S. </p><p>investor interest. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
