<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L OTTAWA 001670 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/12/2013 </p><p>TAGS: KNNP, PARM, MNUC, IR, CA, IAEA, Iran </p><p>SUBJECT: IAEA/IRAN: CANADA SAYS IT WILL SUPPORT OUR EFFORTS </p><p>TO GET BOG RESOLUTION </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) STATE 158048 (B) UNVIE 621 (C) OTTAWA 1556 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Deputy Chief of Mission Stephen R. Kelly, </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Canadian Deputy Foreign Minister Lavertu told DCM on </p><p>June 12 that Canada will support our efforts to get a formal </p><p>resolution on Iran at the June 16 IAEA Board of Governors </p><p>(BOG) meeting (ref. A).  Despite the Canadian delegation\'s </p><p>skepticism in Vienna that such a resolution will be </p><p>attainable (ref. B), Lavertu said Canada will be with us. </p><p>Should a resolution prove impossible, he continued, Canada </p><p>will work with us on an alternative, unambiguous message from </p><p>the BOG meeting.  Lavertu said that in addition to the tough </p><p>messages he and Foreign Minister Graham delivered to their </p><p>Iranian counterparts in Tehran and Paris, respectively (ref. </p><p>C), he met with the Iranian Ambassador in Ottawa after the </p><p>June 6 release of the IAEA report.  Lavertu reiterated </p><p>Canada\'s strong concerns, and told the Ambassador that it was </p><p>most unusual for a preliminary IAEA report to be so strongly </p><p>worded. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Terry Wood, Foreign Affairs Deputy Director for </p><p>Nonproliferation, told us the Canadian Embassy in Tehran </p><p>attended AEOI President Aghazadeh\'s June 9 briefing in Tehran </p><p>(ref. B), and that there were a number of factual errors in </p><p>Aghazadeh\'s presentation.  Wood said Aghazadeh downplayed </p><p>Iran\'s non-declarations as insignificant oversights, and </p><p>described an additional protocol as "no big deal" because </p><p>only two countries with significant nuclear programs have </p><p>signed one thus far.  Agazadeh warned that if the pressure </p><p>continues, Iran will limit its cooperation with the IAEA. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Wood said that Canada is preparing a robust </p><p>intervention for the BOG meeting.  He underscored Canada\'s </p><p>particular concern about the "Kalaye Electric" site, saying </p><p>that Canada had an intelligence source in the late 1990s who </p><p>made them aware of nuclear activity there. </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
