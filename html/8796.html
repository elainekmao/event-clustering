<p>UNCLAS  ZAGREB 001390 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>STATE PASS USTR ERRION AND ALVAREZ </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KIPR, ETRD, PREL, HR, Intellectual Property </p><p>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR WRITES PRIME MINISTER ON </p><p>INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MOU </p><p> </p><p>REF: ZAGREB 1187 and previous (notal) </p><p> </p><p>1.  After hearing from industry contacts that the </p><p>Ministry of Health had deleted language from the draft </p><p>pharmaceutical law that would have provided EU- </p><p>comparable protection for confidential test data, and </p><p>after failing to see Croatian progress on moving the </p><p>1998 MOU on intellectual property to the Parliament, the </p><p>Ambassador sent the following letter to Prime Minister </p><p>Racan: </p><p> </p><p>Begin Text of Letter: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>His Excellency </p><p>Ivica Racan </p><p>Prime Minister of the Republic of Croatia, </p><p>Zagreb </p><p> </p><p>June 16, 2003 </p><p>Dear Mr. Prime Minister: </p><p> </p><p>I am writing to express the continuing request of my </p><p>government that the Croatian government forward to the </p><p>Sabor the U.S.-Croatian Memorandum of Understanding on </p><p>Intellectual Property, signed in 1998.  I also write to </p><p>express our concern that language to protect </p><p>pharmaceutical test data has been removed from the draft </p><p>Pharmaceutical Law.  This language, while not </p><p>substituting for ratification of the Memorandum of </p><p>Understanding, would help address one of our major </p><p>concerns regarding Croatia\'s inadequate protection of </p><p>the intellectual property rights of U.S. as well as </p><p>other foreign companies.  Its deletion further calls </p><p>into question the willingness of the Government of </p><p>Croatia to fulfill its obligation to the U.S. to ratify </p><p>the Memorandum of Understanding, which is an important </p><p>outstanding matter in our relations. </p><p> </p><p>You will recall that the U.S. actively supported </p><p>Croatia\'s entry to the WTO and has brought into effect </p><p>the Bilateral Investment Treaty, both measures to which </p><p>we agreed as part of a package with the Memorandum of </p><p>Understanding.  We fulfilled our commitments in this </p><p>matter; Croatia has not yet done so.  That failure led </p><p>to Croatia being named to the U.S. Special 301 Watch </p><p>List.  In the absence of concrete progress, Croatia will </p><p>eventually face trade sanctions.  This is troubling, </p><p>especially in the context of other recent </p><p>disappointments in our bilateral relationship. </p><p>Secretary of Commerce Evans and UnderSecretary of State </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Larson raised the issue of the Memorandum of </p><p>Understanding with you during your trip to Washington </p><p>last summer.  Assistant Secretary of State Jones raised </p><p>this issue with the Foreign Minister in New York last </p><p>autumn.  I myself have raised it with Deputy Prime </p><p>Minister Simonic and the Ministers of Foreign Affairs, </p><p>Economy and Health.  My staff has discussed it on many </p><p>occasions with working level counterparts.  In none of </p><p>these conversations has the Croatian side contested that </p><p>Croatia undertook the obligation to take all measures </p><p>necessary to ratify the Memorandum of Understanding as </p><p>soon as possible after signature. </p><p> </p><p>I urge that Croatia move from rhetorical recognition of </p><p>its obligations to their fulfillment by moving the </p><p>Memorandum of Understanding in its entirety to the Sabor </p><p>for ratification now.  I also encourage the </p><p>reintroduction of language on data exclusivity into the </p><p>draft Pharmaceutical Law.  That would enable Croatia to </p><p>implement its commitment under the Memorandum of </p><p>Understanding to protect clinical test data as quickly </p><p>as possible. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sincerely, </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Lawrence G. Rossin </p><p>Ambassador </p><p> </p><p>MOON </p><p>NNNN </p><p></p></div>
