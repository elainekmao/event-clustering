<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 USUN NEW YORK 000766 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PARM, UNSC, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: UN/IRAQ: SYG MAKES STATEMENT TO COUNCIL ON IRAQ, </p><p>MARCH 19 (FULL TEXT) </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) IN REMARKS TO THE SECURITY COUNCIL MARCH 19, SYG ANNAN </p><p>EXPRESSED REGRET THAT THE COUNCIL DID NOT REACH A COMMON </p><p>POSITION ON IRAQ, CALLING IT A "SAD DAY" FOR THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.  ANNAN STATED THAT "THE </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY FOR PROTECTING CIVILIANS IN CONFLICT FALLS ON </p><p>THE BELLIGERENTS; IN ANY AREA UNDER MILITARY OCCUPATION, </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE WELFARE OF THE POPULATION FALLS ON THE </p><p>OCCUPYING POWER."  THE UN WOULD PROVIDE WHATEVER ASSISTANCE </p><p>IT COULD TO THE IRAQI PEOPLE "WITHOUT IN ANY WAY ASSUMING OR </p><p>DIMINISHING THAT ULTIMATE RESPONSIBILITY."  THE FULL TEXT OF </p><p>THE ANNAN\'S SPEECH IN INCLUDED AT PARA 2. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) BEGIN TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. </p><p> </p><p>EXCELLENCIES, </p><p> </p><p>NEEDLESS TO SAY, I FULLY SHARE THE REGRETS EXPRESSED BY MANY </p><p>MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL AT THE FACT THAT IT HAS NOT BEEN </p><p>POSSIBLE TO REACH A COMMON POSITION.  WHATEVER OUR DIFFERING </p><p>VIEWS ON THIS COMPLEX ISSUE, WE MUST ALL FEEL THAT THIS IS A </p><p>SAD DAY FOR THE UNITED NATIONS AND THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>COMMUNITY. </p><p> </p><p>I KNOW THAT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD SHARE THIS </p><p>SENSE OF DISAPPOINTMENT, AND ARE DEEPLY ALARMED BY THE </p><p>PROSPECT OF IMMINENT WAR. </p><p> </p><p>LET ME HERE PAY TRIBUTE TO THE UNITED NATIONS STAFF BOTH </p><p>INTERNATIONAL AND IRAQI WHO HAVE WORKED SO HARD IN IRAQ UP TO </p><p>THE LAST POSSIBLE MOMENT.  THAT INCLUDES THE INSPECTORS, </p><p>WHOSE WORK HAS NOW SADLY BEEN SUSPENDED.  I WOULD LIKE TO PAY </p><p>SPECIAL TRIBUTE TO DR. (HANS) BLIX, DR. (MOHAMED) EL BARADEI </p><p>AND (RAMIRO) LOPES DA SILVA, THE HUMANITARIAN COORDINATOR, </p><p>UNDER WHOSE LEADERSHIP THE STAFF WORKED IN IRAQ. </p><p> </p><p>MR. PRESIDENT, IT IS THE PLIGHT OF THE IRAQI PEOPLE WHICH IS </p><p>NOW MY MOST IMMEDIATE CONCERN, AND I HAVE BEEN GLAD TO HEAR </p><p>THAT SENTIMENT SHARED BY ALL THE SPEAKERS IN THIS DEBATE. </p><p> </p><p>IN THE PAST TWENTY YEARS, IRAQIS HAVE BEEN THROUGH TWO MAJOR </p><p>WARS, INTERNAL UPRISINGS AND CONFLICT, AND MORE THAN A DECADE </p><p>OF DEBILITATING SANCTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>THE COUNTRY\'S VITAL INFRASTRUCTURE HAS BEEN DEVASTATED, SO </p><p>THAT IT NO LONGER MEETS THE MOST BASIC NEEDS FOR CLEAN WATER, </p><p>HEALTH OR EDUCATION. </p><p> </p><p>ALREADY, IRAQ\'S MOST VULNERABLE CITIZENS THE ELDERLY, WOMEN </p><p>AND CHILDREN, AND THE DISABLED ARE DENIED BASIC HEALTH CARE </p><p>FOR LACK OF MEDICINE AND MEDICAL EQUIPMENT. </p><p> </p><p>ALREADY, NEARLY ONE MILLION IRAQI CHILDREN SUFFER FROM </p><p>CHRONIC MALNUTRITION. </p><p> </p><p>ALREADY, IRAQIS ARE HEAVILY DEPENDENT ON THE FOOD RATION </p><p>WHICH IS HANDED OUT EACH MONTH TO EVERY FAMILY IN THE </p><p>COUNTRY.  FOR MORE THAN SIXTY PER CENT OF THE POPULATION, </p><p>THIS RATION IS THEIR MAIN SOURCE OF INCOME. YET MANY FAMILIES </p><p>HAVE TO SELL PART OF IT TO BUY CLOTHES OR OTHER ESSENTIALS </p><p>FOR THEIR CHILDREN. </p><p> </p><p>ALL THAT IS TRUE AS WE SPEAK.  AND IN THE SHORT TERM, THE </p><p>CONFLICT THAT IS NOW CLEARLY ABOUT TO START CAN ONLY MAKE </p><p>THINGS WORSE, PERHAPS MUCH WORSE. </p><p> </p><p>MR. PRESIDENT, </p><p> </p><p>I AM SURE ALL MEMBERS OF THIS COUNCIL WILL AGREE THAT WE MUST </p><p>DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO MITIGATE THIS IMMINENT DISASTER, </p><p>WHICH COULD EASILY LEAD TO EPIDEMICS AND STARVATION. </p><p> </p><p>UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW, THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR PROTECTING </p><p>CIVILIANS IN CONFLICT FALLS ON THE BELLIGERENTS; IN ANY AREA </p><p>UNDER MILITARY OCCUPATION, RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE WELFARE OF </p><p>THE POPULATION FALLS ON THE OCCUPYING POWER. </p><p> </p><p>WITHOUT IN ANY WAY ASSUMING OR DIMINISHING THAT ULTIMATE </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY, WE IN THE UNITED NATIONS WILL DO WHATEVER WE </p><p>CAN TO HELP. </p><p> </p><p>AS YOU KNOW, THE HUMANITARIAN AGENCIES OF THE UNITED NATIONS </p><p>HAVE FOR SOME TIME BEEN ENGAGED IN PREPARING FOR THIS </p><p>CONTINGENCY, EVEN WHILE WE HOPED IT COULD STILL BE AVERTED. </p><p> </p><p>WE HAVE DONE OUR BEST TO ASSESS THE POSSIBLE EFFECTS OF WAR, </p><p>IN TERMS OF POPULATION DISPLACEMENT AND HUMAN NEED, AND TO </p><p>POSITION OUR PERSONNEL AND EQUIPMENT ACCORDINGLY.  FOR THESE </p><p>PREPARATIONS WE REQUESTED 123.5 MILLION DOLLARS FROM DONORS A </p><p>MONTH AGO, BUT ONLY 45 MILLION HAVE BEEN PLEDGED, AND 34 </p><p>MILLION DOLLARS RECEIVED, TO DATE.  I\'M AFRAID WE SHALL VERY </p><p>SOON BE COMING BACK WITH AN APPEAL FOR MUCH LARGER SUMS, TO </p><p>FINANCE ACTUAL RELIEF OPERATIONS AND I EARNESTLY HOPE THAT </p><p>MEMBER STATES WILL RESPOND WITH GENEROSITY AND SPEED. </p><p> </p><p>WE HAVE ALSO EXAMINED THE SITUATION CAUSED BY THE SUSPENSION </p><p>OF THE ACTIVITIES OF THE OIL-FOR-FOOD PROGRAMME IN IRAQ, AND </p><p>WAYS THAT THE PROGRAMME COULD BE ADJUSTED TEMPORARILY, TO </p><p>ENABLE US TO CONTINUE PROVIDING HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE TO </p><p>THE PEOPLE OF IRAQ DURING AND AFTER HOSTILITIES. </p><p> </p><p>SUCH ADJUSTMENTS WOULD REQUIRE DECISIONS BY THIS COUNCIL.  I </p><p>WILL THEREFORE SUBMIT MY SPECIFIC PROPOSALS FOR THE COUNCIL\'S </p><p>CONSIDERATION - AS SUGGESTED IN YOUR NOTE, MR. PRESIDENT. </p><p> </p><p>IN CONCLUSION, MR. PRESIDENT, LET ME EXPRESS THE HOPE THAT </p><p>THE EFFORT TO RELIEVE THE SUFFERINGS OF THE IRAQI PEOPLE, AND </p><p>TO REHABILITATE THEIR SOCIETY AFTER SO MUCH DESTRUCTION, MAY </p><p>YET PROVE TO BE THE TASK AROUND WHICH THE UNITY OF THIS </p><p>COUNCIL CAN BE REBUILT. </p><p> </p><p>THANK YOU VERY MUCH. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NEGROPONTE </p><p></p></div>
