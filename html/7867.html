<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 002950 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, P, EUR/SE AND EB </p><p>TREASURY FOR U/S TAYLOR AND OASIA - MILLS </p><p>NSC FOR QUANRUD AND BRYZA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY\'S ECONOMY MAY 6: GOOD NEWS ON INFLATION AND </p><p>T-BILL AUCTIONS; BAD NEWS ON INVESTMENT CLIMATE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but unclassified.  Not for internet distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary: On May 6, Turkish markets continued the </p><p>recent positive trend.  Treasury raised TL 4.9 quadrillion </p><p>(nearly $3 billion) in three T-bill auctions, achieving a </p><p>debt roll-over rate this week of over 100 percent.  April </p><p>inflation data was under market expectations, with CPI at 2.1 </p><p>percent.  The Central Bank began its daily auctions of $20 </p><p>million in dollars to strong demand; this will help build </p><p>CenBank reserves.   As usual in Turkey, however, the news is </p><p>mixed, and the bad news of late is on the structural reform </p><p>side.  Turkey\'s largest foreign investor, Telecom Italia with </p><p>an estimated $3.5 billion stake, announced that it may pull </p><p>out of Turkey if it can\'t solve regulatory disputes with the </p><p>GOT.  The GOT should take this threat seriously, especially </p><p>given the absence of large foreign investor interest.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Markets Relaxing for Summer </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) Good Treasury Auctions.  Turkish Treasury raised TL </p><p>4.9 quadrillion (nearly $3 billion) in three T-bill auctions </p><p>this week, in advance of TL 4.5 quadrillion in debt service </p><p>due May 7.  With a debt roll-over rate of over 100 percent in </p><p>these auctions, Treasury debt manager Volkan Taskin told us </p><p>"so far a good week."  Interest rates in the auctions, at </p><p>53-54 percent compounded, were a bit high, but Taskin </p><p>explained that the Turkish banks held the rates high for the </p><p>auctions.  He expects rates to come down after tomorrow\'s </p><p>redemptions.  The banks will then make money on selling the </p><p>T-bills to clients. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  Strong Demand in Central Bank\'s Dollar Auction.  On May </p><p>6, the Central Bank held the first of its planned daily </p><p>auction of $20 million in dollars, to strong demand.  Total </p><p>bids were $130 million, per the Central Bank.  Central Banker </p><p>Ilker Domac told us this intervention in the f/x market is a </p><p>good way of building up foreign exchange reserves gradually, </p><p>in a rule-based way.  He noted that Mexico\'s Central Bank has </p><p>been doing this for a while.  He claimed the Central Bank is </p><p>not doing the auctions to affect the foreign exchange rate. </p><p>Though exporters always complain, he noted, in fact export </p><p>performance so far this year has been good. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. Good April Inflation Numbers:  April inflation came in </p><p>slightly under market expectations, boosting market hopes for </p><p>another Central Bank rate cut which would in turn boost </p><p>T-bill values.  CPI inflation was 2.1 percent; WPI was 1.8 </p><p>percent.  However, cumulative four-month inflation is now 14 </p><p>percent WPI (year-end target of 17 percent) and 10 percent </p><p>CPI (year-end target 20 percent).  Central Banker Domac </p><p>dismissed the talk here of another rate cut as "another ploy </p><p>by banks to make money."  Asked if the Central Bank would </p><p>seek to revise the inflation targets in the IMF Fifth Review, </p><p>Domac said he would advise against it.  The inflation target </p><p>is CPI not WPI, and CPI is still in reach, he said.  "If we </p><p>miss the target, we\'ll explain it. But it cannot be a moving </p><p>target for credibility reasons." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turkey\'s Largest Foreign Investor Threatens to Pull Out </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) As always in Turkey, the news is mixed.  Though </p><p>sentiment in the financial markets is improving, there are </p><p>troubling signs on the critical issue of improving the </p><p>investment climate.  With only $540 million in net foreign </p><p>direct investment inflows in 2002, Turkey needs to attract </p><p>more long-term capital to achieve macro-economic stability . </p><p>However on May 6, Turkey\'s single largest foreign investor - </p><p>Telecom Italia (TIM) - announced that it may pull out of </p><p>Turkey in several months.  Telecom Italia invested $2.5 </p><p>billion in a cellphone license joint venture in Turkey in </p><p>2000/2001, and then proceeded to invest another $1 billion in </p><p>infrastructure.   TIM says the GOT has not honored the terms </p><p>of its license agreement, including granting roaming rights, </p><p>and alleges unfair competition favoring the other two wholly </p><p>Turkish owned cellphone operators (Cukurova Holding\'s </p><p>Turkcell and the Uzan family\'s Telsim).  Comment:  TIM\'s </p><p>threat may be a negotiating ploy, but the GOT should </p><p>nevertheless take it seriously, given the absence of other </p><p>investor interest in Turkey. End Comment. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
