<p>UNCLAS ZAGREB 000681 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, ENRG, TRGY, SI, HR </p><p>SUBJECT: KRSKO NUCLEAR PLANT AGREEMENT ENTERS INTO FORCE AT </p><p>LAST </p><p> </p><p>REF: LJUBLJANA 216 </p><p> </p><p>1. THE BILATERAL AGREEMENT ON THE KRSKO NUCLEAR POWER PLANT, </p><p>LOCATED IN SLOVENIA BUT CO-OWNED BY SLOVENIA AND CROATIA, </p><p>CAME INTO FORCE ON MARCH 11, THE DATE THE GOC RECEIVED THE </p><p>SLOVENIAN DIPLOMATIC NOTE REGARDING SLOVENIAN RATIFICATION. </p><p>ON MARCH 14, THE CROATIAN PARLIAMENT REJECTED TWO MOTIONS </p><p>FROM OPPOSITION PARTIES TO WITHDRAW CROATIAN RATIFICATION -- </p><p>SOMETHING THE PARLIAMENT HAD LEFT OPEN AS A POSSIBILITY WHEN </p><p>IT RATIFIED THE AGREEMENT IN JULY 2002 IN THE CASE THAT </p><p>SLOVENIA DID NOT RATIFY BY THE END OF 2002. </p><p> </p><p>2.  WHILE THE AGREEMENT SETTLED OUTSTANDING CLAIMS AND </p><p>ARREARS THROUGH JUNE 30, 2002, THE DELAY IN ENTRY INTO FORCE </p><p>MEANS THAT ANOTHER EIGHT MONTHS HAVE LAPSED DURING WHICH </p><p>CROATIA RECEIVED NEITHER ELECTRICITY FROM THE PLANT NOR MONEY </p><p>FROM THE SALE OF THE ELECTRICITY.  ACCORDING TO THE GOC, </p><p>SLOVENIA IS ON THE HOOK TO PAY CROATIA FOR ITS SHARE OF </p><p>ELECTRICITY PROCEEDS DURING THAT PERIOD .  HOWEVER, THE GOC </p><p>HAS ANNOUNCED IT WILL SEEK TO SETTLE THE ISSUE OF </p><p>NON-DELIVERY OF ELECTRICITY DURING THE EIGHT MONTH PERIOD </p><p>SEPARATELY, AND WELCOMES THE AGREEMENT AS CLEARING THE WAY </p><p>FOR CROATIA TO RESUME ITS ROLE AS FIFTY-PERCENT OWNER OF THE </p><p>PLANT. </p><p> </p><p>    3.  OBJECTIONS TO THE KRSKO AGREEMENT IN THE PARLIAMENT </p><p>CENTERED AROUND WHETHER THE FINANCIAL PROVISIONS WERE GOOD </p><p>FOR CROATIA.  ONE OBJECTION CAME FROM THE HSLS (CROATIAN </p><p>SOCIAL LIBERAL PARTY), WHICH LEFT THE RULING COALITION LAST </p><p>SUMMER, OSTENSIBLY OVER THIS ISSUE, AND THE EXTREME </p><p>RIGHT-WING HSP (CROATIAN PARTY OF RIGHTS), WHICH REPORTEDLY </p><p>ALLEGED THAT SUPPORTERS OF THE AGREEMENT IN THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>WERE "COLLABORATORS" OF THE SLOVENES. </p><p> </p><p>4. THERE WAS ALSO SOME CONSTERNATION IN THE PARLIAMENT AND IN </p><p>THE PRESS OVER A PROVISION OF THE SLOVENIAN LAW OF </p><p>RATIFICATION, WHICH CAME AS AN ATTACHMENT TO THE DIPLOMATIC </p><p>NOTE.  THE PROVISION APPARENTLY CITES EU REGULATIONS AS </p><p>REQUIRING A SHORTER TIMELINE FOR DETERMINING FINAL </p><p>DISPOSITION FOR THE NUCLEAR WASTE FROM THE PLANT.  WHILE THE </p><p>PRESS CHOSE TO MAKE AN ISSUE OF THIS PROVISION, AND EVEN </p><p>CLAIMED THAT IT INCREASED THE POSSIBILITY THAT CROATIA MIGHT </p><p>ONE DAY HAVE TO STORE THE WASTE, THE GOVERNMENT EXPLAINED </p><p>THERE WAS NOTHING ABOUT IT THAT CHANGED CROATIA\'S </p><p>OBLIGATIONS, WHICH ARE CONTAINED WITHIN THE TEXT OF THE </p><p>AGREEMENT ITSELF.  IF SLOVENIA WANTED TO TAKE ON ADDITIONAL </p><p>BURDENS, THAT WAS ITS PREROGATIVE. </p><p> </p><p>5. FROM OUR DISCUSSIONS WITH THE MINISTRY OF ECONOMY, IT IS </p><p>CLEAR THAT CROATIA HAS NO INTENTION OF EVER STORING THE WASTE </p><p>ON ITS TERRITORY.  ACCORDING TO THE AGREEMENT, CROATIA AND </p><p>SLOVENIA SHARE RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINDING A PERMANENT </p><p>SOLUTION TO THE DISPOSAL PROBLEM (CURRENTLY, WASTE IS STORED </p><p>ON-SITE AT KRSKO), AND A PROGRAM FOR THE DECOMMISSIONING OF </p><p>THE PLANT SHOULD BE DRAFTED WITHIN 12 MONTHS FROM THE ENTRY </p><p>INTO FORCE OF THE AGREEMENT.  IF THE PARTIES FAIL TO REACH </p><p>    AGREEMENT ON DISPOSAL OF RADIOACTIVE WASTE BY THE END OF THE </p><p>PLANT\'S LIFE (NOW SET FOR 2023, BUT WITH AN EXTENSION </p><p>POSSIBLE), THEN WITHIN TWO YEARS OF THE PLANT\'S </p><p>DECOMMISSIONING, BOTH PARTIES ARE OBLIGED TO STORE THE WASTE </p><p>IN A 50-50 DIVISION.  CROATIA HAS NO INTENTION OF ALLOWING </p><p>THAT TO COME TO PASS, AND OUR CONTACT IN THE MINISTRY OF </p><p>ECONOMY PREDICTED THAT ULTIMATELY THE WASTE WILL END UP IN A </p><p>THIRD COUNTRY. </p><p>ROSSIN </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p></p></div>
