<p>UNCLAS HARARE 002061 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PD, AF/S, AF/RA </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: G0VERNMENT PAPER </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under headline "Correct labeling of GM food a must" </p><p>      the government-owned daily "Herald" uses its September 7 </p><p>      editorial as a petulant parting shot at food assistance </p><p>      from the U.S. Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   "Now that government has accepted genetically modified </p><p>      food aid from the American Government, it is imperative </p><p>      that this food be appropriately labeled to give consumers </p><p>      and aid beneficiaries a choice to either starve or risk </p><p>      eating it.  The measures that have been put in place to </p><p>      quarantine the American maize and closely monitor its </p><p>      transport, milling and distribution will certainly go a </p><p>      long way in protecting the country\'s agricultural industry </p><p>      from contamination.  However, without any conclusive </p><p>      evidence on the effects of GMOs on human beings, the </p><p>      responsibility of eating this food now lies with the </p><p>      individual consumer and aid beneficiary.  If government had </p><p>      its way and enough resources to source and import clean </p><p>      maize to feed the entire nation, it would definitely not </p><p>      risk the health of its people. . .  So the final </p><p>      responsibility lies with Zimbabweans themselves to either </p><p>      eat or not provided they have adequate information warning </p><p>      consumers that this food is genetically engineered. . ." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
