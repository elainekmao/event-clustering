<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ADANA 0096 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINS, PGOV, PHUM, TU, IZ, ADANA, Press Summaries </p><p>SUBJECT:  SOUTHEAST TURKEY PRESS SUMMARY, </p><p>          APRIL 04, 2003 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  This is the Southeastern Turkey press summary </p><p>for April 04, 2003.  Please note that Turkish </p><p>press reports often contain errors or </p><p>exaggerations; AmConsulate Adana does not vouch </p><p>for the accuracy of the reports summarized here. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>POLITICAL, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  Radikal: Turkish and US officials started </p><p>working on activating the issues Turkey and the </p><p>US agreed on during the Secretary of State\'s </p><p>visit to Ankara. Ambassador Pearson discussed </p><p>with his Turkish counterpart, FM Undersecretary </p><p>Ugur Ziyal, about where the Turkish-American-led </p><p>center that will provide military coordination </p><p>with Northern Iraq should be headquartered. </p><p>Turkey, in order to escape debates about the </p><p>"legal structure of the center," asked that the </p><p>unit\'s center be in northern Iraq, while the US </p><p>insisted having it headquartered in Diyarbakir or </p><p>Silopi with a liaison office in Suleymaniye. </p><p>Military and civilian officials will be employed </p><p>at the to-be-formed coordination unit with </p><p>participation from Turkish, US, PUK, IKDP, and </p><p>Turkomen Front officials. The fundamental purpose </p><p>of the coordination unit will be to handle </p><p>refugee and security issues. The center\'s sources </p><p>of information will be the information gathered </p><p>by Turkish and US intelligence. The center will </p><p>gather information about PKK/KADEK and Al Ansar </p><p>activities in the region, assess refugee flows, </p><p>and monitor Kurdish groups vis-Q-vis Mosul and </p><p>Kirkuk. President Bush\'s special envoy, Zalmay </p><p>Khalilzad, is expected to come to Ankara on </p><p>Tuesday to give the final shape to the matter. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  Cumhuriyet: People living in Dohuk and Semele </p><p>towns in Northern Iraq have started moving to the </p><p>mountains and villages close to the Turkish </p><p>border as a precaution against an attack by </p><p>Saddam. The people who had migrated to areas </p><p>close to the Turkish frontier earlier had </p><p>returned their homes, but after artillery fire in </p><p>the vicinity of Selahaddin, Suleymaniye, and </p><p>Erbil, people became anxious again and the ones </p><p>living in Dohuk and Semele migrated to Mt. Beyaz </p><p>and Mt. Zavita regions. It is reported that the </p><p>US and British soldiers, along with Kurdish </p><p>peshmergas, have been put on alert around Dohuk, </p><p>Suleymaniye, Mosul, and Azre, and the US soldiers </p><p>have been primarily positioned at Zavo Mountain </p><p>near Dohuk. Peshmargas and US soldiers have been </p><p>digging positions on the hills at Semele and </p><p>Desta Dubane, and the radar systems set up on Mt. </p><p>Zavo has enabled US soldiers to observe military </p><p>movements in Iraq and Iran. The Gircepel hill </p><p>close to Syria, which was evacuated by Iraqi </p><p>forces, was bombed by US troops. The purpose of </p><p>bombing of the hill has been interpreted as being </p><p>to intimidate Syria. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  Turkiye: Police in disguise have been taking </p><p>stringent security measures around Tarsus </p><p>American College.  The school, which has produced </p><p>many important statesmen in Turkey, has been </p><p>operational for more than 110 years. The security </p><p>measures will remain until the conclusion of the </p><p>war. </p><p>5.  Evrensel: A group of people who gathered </p><p>yesterday in Ovacik quarter of Seyhan district of </p><p>Adana organized a demonstration on the occasion </p><p>of the foundation of KADEK and Abdullah Ocalan\'s </p><p>birthday. The crowd lit a bonfire and shouted </p><p>slogans. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  Radikal: The US Embassy put a new "Visa </p><p>Information Service" for Turkey into operation </p><p>yesterday. From now on, the applicants will </p><p>acquire visa-related information by calling an </p><p>Istanbul call center number (212-340-4444) </p><p>instead of phoning the Embassy or Consulates. </p><p>Callers will be able to get visa appointments as </p><p>well as information.  For this purpose, they will </p><p>have to pay an equivalent of USD 16 in Turkish </p><p>lira for the phone call.  Until April 9, however, </p><p>the call will be free of charge. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ECONOMIC AND CULUTURAL DEVELOPMENTS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  Cumhuriyet: The war on Iraq and the ongoing </p><p>economic crisis has been having a negative impact </p><p>on Gaziantep\'s economy. While production lines </p><p>have been running at 30 percent capacity, many </p><p>have sent their employees on leave without pay, </p><p>and as a result a 30 percent decrease in </p><p>commodity exchange has been reported. Gaziantep </p><p>is the most important regional town with respect </p><p>to trade with Middle Eastern countries.  A </p><p>substantial portion of food items exported to </p><p>Iraq under the oil-for-food program are supplied </p><p>from Gaziantep. The US attack has caused </p><p>stagnation in the region\'s economy. The President </p><p>of the Executive Committee of Gaziantep\'s </p><p>Organized Industrial Zone, Akif Ekici, said </p><p>Gaziantep had an important place in Turkey\'s </p><p>economy, and was a model town for development in </p><p>Anatolia. Ekici said that there were 485 </p><p>operational factories and 120 others under </p><p>construction in the four industrial zones, which </p><p>cover an area of 24 million square meters in </p><p>town. Ekici added that 55 factories suffered </p><p>losses during the 1991 Gulf War, and estimated </p><p>the town\'s financial losses in this war at USD 30 </p><p>million. </p><p>HOLTZ </p><p></p></div>
