<p>UNCLAS ANKARA 003843 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EUR/SE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PREL, TU, OSCE </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKS VIEW TIER III TIP RATING AS UNFAIR, </p><p>THREATENING </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary: GOT officials said they are "disappointed" by </p><p>Turkey\'s Tier III ranking in the 2003 TIP Report.  They </p><p>claimed the report ignores TIP-related reforms adopted by the </p><p>GOT over the past year, and argued that the ranking was not </p><p>based on fair, objective analysis.  The press focused on the </p><p>"threat" of TIP-related sanctions and defined the report as a </p><p>new point of US-Turkish tension.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>MFA: Report Unfair, USG "Biased" Against Turkey </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. Fatma Firat Topcuoglu, DDG of the MFA Consular Affairs </p><p>Department, told Poloff June 11 the GOT is "extremely </p><p>disappointed" with the Tier III rating.  Topcuoglu argued </p><p>that the decision was clearly "not made on its merits."  The </p><p>GOT, she said, had made all the most difficult, substantive </p><p>changes needed to combat TIP, including: 1) adopting an </p><p>anti-TIP law with strong penalties for violators, and opening </p><p>cases against alleged traffickers; 2) signing and ratifying </p><p>all international anti-TIP protocols; 3) amending the law on </p><p>foreigners to create a centralized system of work permits; </p><p>and 4) adopting a National Action Plan on TIP.  Topcuoglu </p><p>said the GOT\'s efforts were not given fair consideration in </p><p>the report.  She said the GOT researched all the countries in </p><p>Tiers I and II, and none has done as much as Turkey to fight </p><p>trafficking.  Topcuoglu said there have been only a few cases </p><p>opened against alleged traffickers because TIP is not a </p><p>large-scale problem in Turkey.  She concluded that the USG is </p><p>biased against Turkey.  The MFA June 12 issued a brief </p><p>statement claiming that Turkey has made "radical changes" to </p><p>its laws relating to anti-trafficking, which had not been </p><p>given due consideration.  The statement said the GOT is </p><p>"disappointed and saddened" by the report. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>Interior Minister: Report Not Based On Evidence </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. At a public ceremony June 12, Interior Minister Aksu said </p><p>human smuggling had become a serious problem across the </p><p>region, and that the GOT had passed a number of "exemplary" </p><p>laws and regulations in recent years to combat it.  He said </p><p>he "regrets" that the USG, in its TIP report, accuses Turkey </p><p>of ignoring the problem, and claimed the TIP report was not </p><p>based on "objective evidence." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>Press Focuses on Sanctions "Threat," "Tensions" </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. All major dailies carried stories June 13 on the TIP </p><p>report.  Many of the articles noted the importance of IMF </p><p>loans for Turkey and characterized the possibility of a </p><p>cut-off of IMF loans and other TIP-related sanctions as a new </p><p>"threat" against Turkey.  Several papers, including the </p><p>social democrat/intellectual Cumhuriyet and the populist </p><p>Aksam, described the TIP report as a new "point of tension" </p><p>in the US-Turkey relationship. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
