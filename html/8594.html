<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 003731 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EUR/SE, NEA/NGA AND EB/ESC </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/09/2008 </p><p>TAGS: EPET, PREL, ETRD, IZ, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: FACILITATING TURKEY-IRAQ FUEL OIL FOR GASOLINE/LPG </p><p>BARTER DEAL </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 3537 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Baghdad minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by DCM Robert Deutsch.  Reason: 1.5(b,d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) In separate June 9 meetings, Ambassador and EconCouns </p><p>urged MFA U/S Ziyal and Foreign Trade U/S Kayalar, </p><p>respectively, to facilitate GOT approval of the pending </p><p>SOMO-Delta Petroleum barter deal (reftel), under which SOMO </p><p>would export fuel oil to Turkey in return for benzine </p><p>(gasoline) and LPG.  Ziyal said he would try to accelerate </p><p>the approval process, while Kayalar predicted Turkey would </p><p>put in place import procedures for products from Iraq, </p><p>including fuel oil, by the end of this week.  As in previous </p><p>meetings on this subject, Embassy officials stressed that </p><p>implementation of this deal would bring significant </p><p>humanitarian and economic benefits to Iraq, and offered an </p><p>opportunity for the Turks to demonstrate their helpfulness on </p><p>Iraq (while advancing Turkish economic interests). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  We have received conflicting information from GOT </p><p>officials on whether the lack of import procedures is the </p><p>only hold-up in implementing this deal.  Some MFA officials </p><p>have suggested that approval will be linked to U.S. success </p><p>in reducing or eliminating the truck "fees" being extracted </p><p>by local groups on the Iraqi side of the border. Foreign </p><p>Trade U/S Kayalar, on the other hand, said the deal could go </p><p>through immediately once the GOT established proper import </p><p>procedures, though he added that the "fees" issue needed to </p><p>be resolved. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Pol-Mil officer spoke with local KDP rep Safeen </p><p>Dizayee today on the issue of fees being charged by Kurds at </p><p>the border.  Dizayee said the KDP leadership understands </p><p>there needs to be uniform, transparent procedures in place, </p><p>but that those procedures and the fees charged need to take </p><p>into consideration the Kurds\' concerns about revenue, and the </p><p>fact that 80 percent of their income and the source of pay </p><p>for some 200,000 KDP employees came from these revenues.  He </p><p>said the KDP would be briefing a new fee plan based on </p><p>categories of goods and truck size to Turkish Customs </p><p>officials in Silopi, Turkey on either June 9 or June 10.  His </p><p>bottom line was that, while the Kurds would exempt U.S. </p><p>military and UN shipments, Turkish businessmen would have to </p><p>pay the same fee as U.S., UK, Saudi or any other businessmen. </p><p> He did not know how import fees worked in the South. </p><p>Pol-Miloff responded that the USG was concerned about any </p><p>measures, including high fees charged passing trucks, that </p><p>hindered the flow of needed goods into Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Embassy will continue to press the GOT to take the </p><p>steps necessary to allow this barter deal to proceed, </p><p>including following up with the Prime Minister\'s staff. </p><p>Also, Delta Petroleum is in regular contact with Finance </p><p>Minister Kemal Unakitan, who has been supportive.  We suggest </p><p>this issue should be on the agenda for U/S Ziyal\'s visit to </p><p>Washington next week. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
