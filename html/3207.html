(C) When Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba decided to </p><p>dissolve Parliament, he cited MPs\' refusal to extend the </p><p>state of national emergency as a primary reason (Ref A). </p><p>Legal experts and others, however, hold different opinions on </p><p>the continued need of the state of emergency, as Parliament </p><p>passed legislation granting the security forces many of the </p><p>emergency powers to fight the Maoists--minus restrictions on </p><p>civil liberties.   End summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p>SAFETY AND SECURITY UNDER THE STATE OF EMERGENCY </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  The state of national emergency, first declared by </p><p>King Gyanendra November 26 after Maoist insurgents </p><p>unilaterally broke a four-month cease-fire, has been in </p><p>continuous operation in Nepal (minus a 24-hour lapse in </p><p>mid-May following the dissolution of Parliament) for nearly </p><p>seven months.  The Royal Nepal Army (RNA) has undoubtedly </p><p>made gains against Maoist insurgents since November, and its </p><p>deployment has boosted casualty statistics steadily upward. </p><p>Residents of Kathmandu generally feel that security in the </p><p>city--after a precipitous dip from December-April--has </p><p>improved markedly.  Businessmen report a decline in extortion </p><p>attempts, and the incidence of urban bomb-blasts, a staple of </p><p>the December and April general strikes, has dropped off </p><p>sharply. More and more people are out on the streets at </p><p>night, and businesses are open later.  Other major cities </p><p>also report a lessening of tension.  Not far from the </p><p>Kathmandu Valley, however, the situation can be vastly </p><p>different, where some communities outside heavily fortified </p><p>district headquarters are largely left to fend for themselves </p><p>against marauding Maoists, especially at night.  Many police </p><p>posts in more remote areas have been abandoned, as the police </p><p>consolidate their positions in more populated areas, often </p><p>side by side with Army positions.  Curfews are selectively </p><p>applied on a district-by-district basis.  At least two people </p><p>have been shot and killed in the troubled district of Dang in </p><p>southwestern Nepal for violating the curfew there. </p><p>Kathmandu, on the other hand, has no official curfew, </p><p>although most residents, shopkeepers and businesses observe, </p><p>by tacit consent, an unofficial curfew of 9:00 p.m., </p><p>although, as mentioned above, this appears to be being </p><p>relaxed.  Members of Kathmandu\'s business elite--many of whom </p><p>faced threats and extortion before the emergency--generally </p><p>approve of the clampdown,  although some grumble that curfews </p><p> and ubiquitous check-points cut into the tourism and </p><p>entertainment industries\' profits.  The state of emergency </p><p>has the full backing of Kathmandu\'s business leaders, as </p><p>exemplified by the heads of the Chambers of Commerce and </p><p>Industries. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>DO YOU NEED AN ORDINANCE WHEN YOU HAVE AN ACT? </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  After ratifying the state of emergency in </p><p>February, thereby ensuring its continuation until May 25, </p><p>Parliament passed the Terrorist and Destructive Activities </p><p>Act April 4, that codified into law many of the emergency </p><p>provisions contained in the royal ordinance (Ref B).  The Act </p><p>was intended to allow the Government to continue the fight </p><p>against the insurgents without continued imposition of the </p><p>state of emergency and to fulfill commitments under UN </p><p>Security Council Resolution 1373 to take steps to combat </p><p>terrorism (Ref C).  Both the Act and the ordinance maintain </p><p>the same definitions of "terrorist" and "terrorist </p><p>activities," grant sweeping powers to members of the security </p><p>forces, including the Army, to arrest without charge and/or </p><p>hold in preventive detention suspected terrorists,  and </p><p>reserve the same penalties for commission of terrorist acts. </p><p>(Note:  While both the Act and the emergency ordinance allow </p><p>the military to detain people, neither explicitly permits the </p><p>army to hold detainees for extended periods.  Instead, the </p><p>military is supposed to turn over detainees to civilian </p><p>authorities within 24 hours, according to the Ministry of Law </p><p>and Justice.  We have learned, however, that in many cases </p><p>the military sidesteps this requirement either by ignoring it </p><p>completely or by obtaining notification from the relevant </p><p>civilian authority--often the Chief District Officer--that </p><p>the jails are full, which, unfortunately, they often are. </p><p>End note.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) The Act does, however, differ from the ordinance in </p><p>some procedural aspects, according to Dili Raj Ghimire, Under </p><p>Secretary at the Ministry of Law and Justice.  For example, </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>the Act stipulates that suspects should be arrested only if </p><p>there is "reasonable grounds" for suspicion of guilt, </p><p>although the law does not define "reasonable grounds."  The </p><p>Act allows members of the security forces to "search any </p><p>house, shop, warehouse, transport vehicle or any other place </p><p>belonging to any person whomsoever at any time" or "any </p><p>person or goods that the person is carrying with him" as long </p><p>as "notice"--not necessarily a warrant--is given (whether </p><p>before, during or after the search is not stipulated). </p><p>Suspects arrested under the Act must be produced before the </p><p>court within 60 days (although they can be held in preventive </p><p>detention for 90 days, as long as the place of detention has </p><p>the basic amenities of light, water, sufficient air, etc.). </p><p>The ordinance, on the other hand, places no limit upon the </p><p>time before a suspect\'s first court appearance, and allows </p><p>the period of preventive detention to be extended for an </p><p>additional 90 days.  For the most part, provisions of the Act </p><p>provide greater safeguards for the rights of the accused, </p><p>Ghimire emphasized.  Perhaps the most significant difference </p><p>between the Act and ordinance is that the Act, according to </p><p>Law Secretary Udaya Nepali Shrestha, does not abridge basic </p><p>civil liberties, such as freedom of press and freedom of </p><p>assembly, and the right to pursue judicial remedy.  Sindhu </p><p>Nath Pyakurel, Chairman of the Nepal Bar Association, echoed </p><p>the Secretary\'s interpretation, adding his view that </p><p>imposition of a state of emergency is not necessary to </p><p>enforce the provisions of the Act. </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>THE PM DOES </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  At some point, Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba </p><p>seems to have shared the view that the emergency ordinance </p><p>had been made largely redundant by passage of the Act.  Upon </p><p>his May 15 return from his headline-grabbing visits to the </p><p>U.S. and UK, he was quoted by local reporters as asserting </p><p>the emergency--due to expire a mere ten days later--"isn\'t </p><p>necessary to combat terrorism."  Within a week, however, and </p><p>after extensive discussions with the security chiefs (and, </p><p>some believe, the Palace), Deuba reversed his public position </p><p>radically, and was pushing, against the apparent opposition </p><p>of most MPs in his party, for a six-month extension of the </p><p>emergency.  Deuba subsequently asked the King to dissolve </p><p>Parliament and call fresh elections (Ref A).  Although Deuba </p><p>confided to the Ambassador that his primary motive in moving </p><p>against Parliament was to avert a no-confidence motion (Ref </p><p>A), the PM\'s May 24 public address to the nation focused on </p><p>extension of the emergency--and the danger that would befall </p><p>the nation in its absence--as his most important reason.  He </p><p>told the public he wanted to extend the emergency to "keep </p><p>morale high and continue the successes achieved by the </p><p>security forces against the terrorists and continue the </p><p>campaign against terrorism."  Continuing the emergency was </p><p>important "for the protection of democratic system and the </p><p>strengtheninng of national security to defeat the </p><p>terrorists."  The ruling party\'s failure to support </p><p>extension, on the other hand, "boosted up the morale of the </p><p>terrorists"; those opposed to extension "were working for the </p><p>fulfillment of the terrorists\' wishes." </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  In spite of the importance the PM publicly claimed </p><p>to attach to extension of the emergency, he has never </p><p>discussed in detail the perceived deficiencies of the Act in </p><p>prosecuting the insurgency.  One former member of the PM\'s </p><p>Cabinet, while acknowledging the PM\'s legitimate fear of a </p><p>no-confidence motion, commented that the PM should have been </p><p>more willing to give the Act "a chance" to determine its </p><p>effectiveness in countering the insurgency before insisting </p><p>on the emergency.  Deuba\'s about-face, his former colleague </p><p>observed, puts him in the paradoxical position of arguing on </p><p>the one hand that conditions in the country are so dangerous </p><p>that extension of the state of emergency is necessary while </p><p>positing on the other that conditions in the country are safe </p><p>enough to hold national elections.  Other observers have </p><p>criticized the PM for calling national elections at the same </p><p>time that the Government opted to postpone local body </p><p>elections--due to have been held in May--for security reasons. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>THE ARMY\'S ARGUMENT </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Given the compressed sequence of consultations </p><p>following Deuba\'s return to Nepal in May, some observers have </p><p>speculated that the military influenced the PM to insist on </p><p>the emergency.  (Comment:  Another scenario is that the PM, </p><p>convinced that his political rivals would persist in trying </p><p>to unseat him, chose extension of the state of emergency--an </p><p>issue on which he was certain of support from the Army and </p><p>the Palace--as a pretext to stage a showdown.  End comment.) </p><p>Maj. Gen. Rukmungud Katuwal told the Ambassador that RNA </p><p>leadership had asked for extension, after exchanging frank </p><p>views with Deuba on the security situation.  Many other </p><p>members of the military leadership have told us they favor </p><p>extension of the state of emergency for a variety of reasons. </p><p> Chief of General Staff Lt. Gen. Pyar Jung Thapa told the </p><p>Ambassador he favors retaining the emergency because it is </p><p>useful in partly controlling the press and politicians and </p><p>because he believes the Act weakens security forces\' ability </p><p>to perform search and seizure.  He said he would support </p><p>greater flexibility in the state of emergency, making it </p><p>applicable selectively on a district-by-district basis. </p><p>According to Col. Deepak Gurung, head of the RNA\'s Office of </p><p>Public Affairs, imposition of the emergency makes the Army\'s </p><p>task easier by prohibiting meetings of more than four </p><p>persons, eliminating the possibility of strikes, allowing </p><p>extended periods of detention and permitting searches without </p><p>warrants.  (As noted in Para 4 above, the Act grants </p><p>extensive powers of search to security forces.)  A civilian </p><p>Ministry of Defense spokesman, speaking off the record, </p><p>agreed that the Act and the emergency contain nearly </p><p>identical provisions, and speculated that the RNA wants </p><p>continuation of the emergency as a way of suppressing </p><p>unfavorable coverage in the press.  Law Under Secretary </p><p>Ghimire commented that, absent the emergency, the security </p><p>forces "would have a lot of trouble" from people pressing </p><p>cases in court against illegal detention, false arrest, etc. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  While the Prime Minister moved to dissolve </p><p>Parliament to avoid a vote of no confidence, he has gone on </p><p>record as citing the need for an extended state of emergency </p><p>as his principal motivation.  This emphasis has resulted, not </p><p>surprisingly, in heightened scrutiny of the emergency\'s </p><p>protracted restictions on civil rights.  The simultaneous </p><p>suspension of civil rights and dissolution of </p><p>Parliament--complicated by the uncertain prospect of </p><p>elections occurring on schedule--put Nepal\'s already fragile </p><p>democratic institutions under significant strain. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
