<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 HANOI 000483 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: BEXP, XXX </p><p>SUBJECT: QUESTIONNAIRE ON DUTIES/TAXES AND CUSTOMS </p><p>PROCEDURES FOR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PRODUCTS AND </p><p>ELECTRONIC COMMERCE TRANSACTIONS </p><p> </p><p>To be able to answer the questionnaire cited in the </p><p>cable, Post has sent SCO\'s letters dated Thursday, </p><p>February 13, 2003, to the Vietnamese State agencies, </p><p>including Ministry of Trade, General Department of </p><p>Vietnam Customs, and General Department of Taxation </p><p>of Vietnam, requesting their cooperation in answering </p><p>the questionnaire.  Post has continuously followed up </p><p>and urged them to reply, but to date, there is no </p><p>official response from these Vietnamese relevant </p><p>Government agencies.  Consequently, answers in this </p><p>cable is done basing on the best of knowledge of </p><p>industry specialist through business practice, </p><p>unofficial interviews with some contacts at the </p><p>relevant Government agencies, including General </p><p>Department of Taxation of Vietnam, General Department </p><p>of Customs of Vietnam, Ministry of Trade, Ministry of </p><p>Post and Telematics, Ministry of Public Security, </p><p>Ministry of Labor, Invalids, and Social Affairs, and </p><p>several Vietnamese and U.S. information technology </p><p>companies operating in Vietnam.  Should any questions </p><p>on these issues herein be arised, Post will continue </p><p>to update and/or further clarify. </p><p> </p><p>I.   QUESTIONS ON SOFTWARE / RELATED SERVICES IMPORTS </p><p> </p><p>A. ARE DUTIES AND TAXES ASSESSED ON THE INTELLECTUAL </p><p>PROPERTY OF THE SOFTWARE OR ON THE MEDIUM ON WHICH IT </p><p>IS PRESENTED?  IS CUSTOMIZED SOFTWARE TREATED </p><p>DIFFERENTLY THAN PACKAGED SOFTWARE? </p><p>Duties and taxes are assessed under HS code list </p><p>(e.g. newspapers, magazines, books, documents, etc., </p><p>in tapes, CD-ROM, VCD, DVD, etc.), which includes the </p><p>intellectual property element.  So far, there are no </p><p>legal documents in Vietnam mentioning the distinction </p><p>of customized and packaged software. </p><p> </p><p>B. WHAT ARE THE CUSTOMS\' DUTIES AND TAX IMPLICATIONS </p><p>FOR SOFTWARE SOLD WITH UPDATES WHERE THE FULL SALES </p><p>PRICE, INCLUDING COST OF UPDATES, IS SHOWN ON THE </p><p>ORIGINAL COMMERCIAL INVOICE? ARE DUTIES/TAXES PAID ON </p><p>THAT AMOUNT?  WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE UPDATES ARE SENT </p><p>AT A LATER DATE?  ARE DUTIES/TAXES APPLIED AGAIN?  IF </p><p>SO, BASED ON WHAT VALUE?  HOW SHOULD INFORMATION BE </p><p>PRESENTED ON THE COMMERCIAL INVOICE FOR THE ORIGINAL </p><p>AND SUBSEQUENT SHIPMENTS TO AVOID PAYING DUTIES/TAXES </p><p>MORE THAN ONCE ON A SINGLE SALE? </p><p>So far, Vietnam\'s current laws and regulations are </p><p>not precise and there\'s no guidance on this </p><p>particular issue.  As a matter of fact, Vietnam </p><p>leaves this type of products open, i.e. software is </p><p>subject to duty-free.  Tax is only levied on the </p><p>physical value of imported diskette/CD-ROM (i.e. the </p><p>medium containing software).  (E.g. a $US3 CD </p><p>contains a software valued at thousands of USD, tax </p><p>is levied based on the $US3 value of the diskette/CD- </p><p>ROM.) Vietnam Customs has been studying Article 7 of </p><p>General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) </p><p>regarding definition of value to be taxed under the </p><p>international general rules to apply in this year of </p><p>2003.  At present, in case of imported software is </p><p>declared according to its value shown in sales </p><p>contract and commercial invoice, Vietnam Customs </p><p>considers the regular papers and accepts them as </p><p>basis to tax.  There\'s no clear and precise </p><p>distinction between initial software shipment and its </p><p>update, so double taxation might be occurred in this </p><p>case.  To avoid such a problem, the value of the </p><p>software should be clearly declared and stated. </p><p> </p><p>C. ARE SOFTWARE LICENSES CLASSIFIED IN HARMONIZED </p><p>SYSTEM 4907?  ARE IMPORT DUTIES/TAXES APPLIED?  IF </p><p>YES, ON WHAT COST/PRICE BASE ARE THEY LEVIED?  ARE </p><p>WITHHOLDING OR OTHER ADDITIONAL TAXES APPLIED ON </p><p>SOFTWARE LICENSES?  IF YES, HOW ARE THE TAXES </p><p>APPLIED?HS 4907 does seem not appropriate for this </p><p>case because such a HS code is not related to </p><p>software, but is related to Unused Postage, Check </p><p>Forms, Banknotes, Stock, etc.  Please check on this. </p><p>Answer to this question is the same as the one to the </p><p>above question, Vietnam is not ready for this matter. </p><p>There\'s no regulation stated in one official document </p><p>regarding this issue.  In fact, the Vietnamese </p><p>relevant agencies solve incurred problems on a case </p><p>by case according to their experience and precedent. </p><p> </p><p>D. IF A U.S. LICENSE AGREEMENT IS INCLUDED IN THE </p><p>PACKAGING OR IS PART OF THE INSTALLATION/REGISTRATION </p><p>OF SHRINK WRAPPED SOFTWARE IMPORTED FROM THE U.S., </p><p>WOULD THAT AGREEMENT BE BINDING ON CONSUMERS IN YOUR </p><p>MARKET?  IF SO, WOULD U.S. OR LOCAL LAWS PERTAIN? </p><p>[DEFINITION OF SHRINK WRAPPED SOFTWARE: SHRINK </p><p>WRAPPED SOFTWARE IS SOFTWARE THAT IS PACKAGED WITH A </p><p>TERMS AND CONDITIONS STATEMENT, READY FOR </p><p>INSTALLATION BY THE PURCHASER. </p><p>This issue is quite new to Vietnam.  Answer is the </p><p>same as the above one. </p><p> </p><p>E. ARE SERVICES (I.E. TRAINING, SET-UP, ETC) RELATING </p><p>TO THE SALE OF SOFTWARE TAXED?  IF SO, AT WHAT RATE </p><p>AND BASED ON WHAT VALUE?  (1) ARE US INFORMATION </p><p>TECHNOLOGY SOLUTION PROVIDERS PERMITTED TO SEND </p><p>PERSONNEL INTO THE COUNTRY TO SET UP HARDWARE / </p><p>SOFTWARE RELATED SYSTEMS? (2) ARE SPECIAL VISAS / </p><p>WORK PERMITS AND / OR PROFESSIONAL CERTIFICATION BY </p><p>AN ACCREDITED BODY REQUIRED? </p><p>No VAT and no import duties are applicable to the </p><p>said services, but personal income tax and corporate </p><p>income tax is.  Customs procedures are not quite </p><p>clear thus far.  (1) U.S. IT solution providers are </p><p>permitted to send personnel into Vietnam for such a </p><p>purpose.  In general, foreign workers entering </p><p>Vietnam must have entry visa issued by Vietnam\'s </p><p>Ministry of Public Security.  (2) However, it should </p><p>be noted that personnel sent to Vietnam for short </p><p>term entrance must be invited by a Vietnamese legal </p><p>entity that is licensed to operate in the IT and/or </p><p>telecom industry, and the person coming to Vietnam </p><p>for a long term must apply for registration and work </p><p>permit issued by Vietnam\'s Ministry of Public </p><p>Security and Ministry of Labors, Invalids, and Social </p><p>Affairs. </p><p> </p><p>F. ARE IMPORT TAXES (VAT, ETC) APPLIED TO SOFTWARE </p><p>DELIVERED TO THE END-USER OVER THE INTERNET?  IF SO, </p><p>ARE THE TAXES ASSESSED ON THE INTELLECTUAL VALUE OF </p><p>THE PROPERTY?  WOULD THE SITUATION BE DIFFERENT IF </p><p>THIS SOFTWARE WERE INSTEAD DELIVERED TO A DISTRIBUTOR </p><p>WHO HAS A LICENSE TO PRODUCE (REPLICATE) AND SELL THE </p><p>SOFTWARE? </p><p>Until now, this issue is still out of control of </p><p>Vietnam\'s management ability. </p><p> </p><p>G. IS POST AWARE OF ANY LAWS OR EFFORTS TO REGULATE </p><p>VOICE OVER INTERNET PROTOCOL (VOIP) SERVICES IN YOUR </p><p>COUNTRY? (PLEASE NAME THE SPECIFIC LAW, GOVERNMENT </p><p>AGENCY(IES) WITH JURISDICTION, AND CONTACT </p><p>INFORMATION) </p><p>All telecommunications services in Vietnam, including </p><p>the services using VoIP technology, is regulated by </p><p>Ordinance on Post and Telecommunications No. </p><p>43/2002/PL-UBTVQH10 dated May 25, 2002, promulgated </p><p>by Vietnam\'s National Assembly.  However, until now, </p><p>there\'s not yet under-law documents regulating the </p><p>VoIP technology-based services is issued.  The </p><p>Ordinance is passed by the National Assembly, but it </p><p>is drafted and monitored by the Ministry of Post and </p><p>Telematics (MPT) Contact Information:  Ministry of </p><p>Post and Telematics of Vietnam, 18 Nguyen Du Street, </p><p>Hanoi, Vietnam.  Tel: (84-4) 826-3576; Fax: (84-4) </p><p>943-6607 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>II.  QUESTIONS ON CUSTOMS PROCEDURES RELATED TO IT </p><p>PRODUCTS </p><p> </p><p>A. WHAT ARE THE DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS FOR THE </p><p>PHYSICAL IMPORT OF SOFTWARE?  FOR OTHER INFORMATION </p><p>TECHNOLOGY PRODUCTS? </p><p>According to Vietnam\'s Law on Customs dated June 29, </p><p>2001, and relevant guidance legal documents, customs </p><p>papers required for imported goods basically include </p><p>customs declaration paper, sales contract, commercial </p><p>invoice, goods packaging bills, certificate of </p><p>origin, etc.  The Certificate of Origin (C/O) is </p><p>still a problem here.  This certificate is issued in </p><p>many countries by government agencies or chamber of </p><p>commerce and industry, but is not applicable in the </p><p>U.S.  Neither the U.S. Government nor U.S. Chamber of </p><p>Commerce issues this type of papers.  Many U.S. </p><p>companies and their Vietnamese business partners face </p><p>this problem with Vietnam\'s Customs offices.  The </p><p>Vietnamese authorities are expecting some U.S. </p><p>government agency to officially announce this matter </p><p>of fact so that they can inform the local customs </p><p>offices not to require such C/O to U.S. exports. </p><p>Besides, in terms of IT imported products, it is </p><p>required to show "Certificate of Standard Compliance" </p><p>issued by Vietnam\'s Ministry of Post and Telematics. </p><p>Contents of some software relevant to cultural and </p><p>sensitive information must be checked and vetted by </p><p>Vietnam\'s Ministry of Culture and Information. </p><p> </p><p>B. WHAT ARE THE DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS FOR THE </p><p>ELECTRONICALLY DELIVERED IMPORT OF DIGITIZED PRODUCTS </p><p>OVER THE INTERNET OR OTHER NETWORKS (I.E. SOFTWARE, </p><p>MOVIE DOWNLOADS)? </p><p>Vietnam is not capable at this time to manage this </p><p>issue. Related agencies still leave this issue open. </p><p> </p><p>C. IS THE IMPORT OF REFURBISHED COMPUTER HARDWARE, </p><p>PARTS, AND ACCESSORIES (INCLUDING TONER CARTRIDGES) </p><p>PERMITTED?  IF YES, WHAT ARE THE DOCUMENTATION </p><p>REQUIREMENTS?  IS SPECIAL LABELING REQUIRED?  WHAT </p><p>VALUE SHOULD BE SHOWN ON THE INVOICE?  HOW ARE DUTIES </p><p>AND TAXES ASSESSED? </p><p>The said goods are in the list of goods prohibited to </p><p>import into Vietnam in the period 2001-2005 issued by </p><p>the Government of Vietnam.  However, this matter is </p><p>not quite clear in fact in Vietnam.  Parts and </p><p>accessories are not permitted, but sets of </p><p>refurbished or used computers are imported into </p><p>Vietnam.  Vietnam Customs agrees to import on a case </p><p>by case basis.  In case of permitting to be imported, </p><p>such goods are subject to 5% import duties and 5% </p><p>Value Added Tax. </p><p> </p><p>D. IS THE IMPORT OF USED COMPUTER HARDWARE, PARTS, </p><p>AND ACCESSORIES PERMITTED?  IF YES, WHAT ARE THE </p><p>DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS?  IS SPECIAL LABELING </p><p>REQUIRED?  WHAT VALUE SHOULD BE SHOWN ON THE INVOICE? </p><p>HOW ARE DUTIES AND TAXES ASSESSED? </p><p>The same as the preceding. </p><p> </p><p>E. ARE DUTIES AND TAXES ASSESSED ON THE RE-IMPORT OF </p><p>REPAIRED COMPUTER EQUIPMENT?  HOW SHOULD THE </p><p>COMMERCIAL INVOICE APPEAR? </p><p>Taxes are not levied on sum of value, but levied on </p><p>added value of the repair contracts (based on repair </p><p>bills).  I.e. Goods imported into Vietnam that have </p><p>to brought abroad for repair or maintenance, when </p><p>being reimported to Vietnam, is exempted from import </p><p>duties.  If there is any added value making usage </p><p>value increase is subject to pay import duties and </p><p>VAT with respect to the added value.  Commercial </p><p>invoice indicating the consolidated value and </p><p>declaration paper on temporary export for </p><p>repair/maintenance are very important to be basis to </p><p>define tax rate. </p><p> </p><p>F. SOME COMPANIES ALLEGE THAT CERTAIN COUNTRIES (SUCH </p><p>AS GREECE AND SOUTH KOREA, AMONG OTHERS) REQUIRE THAT </p><p>CROSS-BORDER, ELECTRONICALLY DELIVERED SOFTWARE BE </p><p>ACCOMPANIED BY A PHYSICAL SHIPMENT.  IS THIS TRUE FOR </p><p>YOUR COUNTRY? IF SO, BY WHAT GOVERNMENT AGENCY </p><p>(PLEASE GIVE CONTACT INFORMATION), AND HOW IS THIS </p><p>ACTIVITY ENFORCED (PLEASE SPECIFY THE NAME OF THE </p><p>APPROPRIATE LAW OR REGULATION)? </p><p>This issue is still out of control of Vietnam\'s </p><p>management capabilities in this industry. </p><p> </p><p>(ORIGIN: 6430/ITA/ITI/OITEC/DKRIZ) </p><p> </p><p>REGARDS.
