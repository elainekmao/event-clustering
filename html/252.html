<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L BOGOTA 18358 </p><p> </p><p>SOUTHCOM FOR POLAD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS: PINS, PTER, MOPS, PGOV, CO </p><p>SUBJECT: DESTRUCTION OF FARC\'S 45TH FRONT AND OTHER </p><p>         RECENT FARC LOSSES </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. BOGOTA 18283; B. BOGOTA 17707 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  SUMMARY:  A RARE SUCCESS BY THE ARMY AGAINST </p><p>THE FARC GUERRILLAS IN META LAST MONTH (REF B), AND </p><p>FARC LOSSES DURING THEIR SEPTEMBER AND OCTOBER </p><p>OFFENSIVES APPEAR TO HAVE RESULTED IN A REDUCTION OF </p><p>THEIR PREVIOUS HIGH RATE OF ATTACKS.  THESE LOSSES MAY </p><p>HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH THEIR SUDDEN RENEWAL OF </p><p>INTEREST IN POLITICAL INITIATIVES, SUCH AS THE PEACE </p><p>PLAN PROPOSED BY CONSERVATIVE SENATOR LEYVA DURAN </p><p>(REF A).  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  IN ITS DECEMBER 9 ISSUE, "EL TIEMPO" </p><p>PUBLISHED A DETAILED REPORT THAT THE ARMY\'S VII </p><p>BRIGADE TROOPS SUCCEEDED NOVEMBER 26 IN DISMANTLING </p><p>AND RENDERING COMBAT INEFFECTIVE THE ENCAMPMENT OF THE </p><p>FARC\'S 45TH FRONT IN ARIARI, META DEPARTMENT (SEE </p><p>REFTEL).  ACCORDING TO THE ARTICLE, THE ATTACK WAS </p><p>SUPPORTED BY THREE BLACK HAWK HELICOPTERS AND CAUGHT </p><p>THE GUERRILLAS BY SURPRISE.  THE ACCOUNT SAYS THAT THE </p><p>GUERRILLAS LOST 21 KILLED IN THAT ACTION, MOST FROM </p><p>BLASTS BY RIFLE-LAUNCHED GRENADES AS THE GUERRILLAS </p><p>TRIED TO FLEE.  GUERRILLA CASUALTIES INCLUDED THE </p><p>LEADER OF THE FARC\'S 45TH FRONT, BUT SOME 30 SURVIVING </p><p>GUERRILLAS MANAGED TO FLEE THE AREA IN A ROUT. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  BRIGADIER GENERAL HAROLD BEDOYA PIZARRO, </p><p>COMMANDER OF THE ARMY\'S VII BRIGADE WAS QUOTED AS </p><p>SAYING THAT THE ARMY WILL REMAIN IN THE ARARI ZONE TO </p><p>"CONTINUE HELPING ITS INHABITANTS FIGHT OFF THE FARC </p><p>CRIMINALS, WHO FOR YEARS HAVE WROUGHT ONLY POVERTY, </p><p>DESOLATION AND VIOLENCE TO PEACEFUL SETTLERS IN THAT </p><p>REGION." </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  WEEKLY "SEMANA" NEWS MAGAZINE PUBLISHED A </p><p>BLURB ON THE WEEK OF DECEMBER 9 REPORTING FARC LOSSES </p><p>INCURRED IN THE SERIES OF OFFENSIVES LAUNCHED BY THAT </p><p>GROUP AFTER SEPTEMBER 1.  QUOTING "NATIONAL AND </p><p>REGIONAL AUTHORITIES," SEMANA REPORTED THAT DURING </p><p>THIS THREE MONTH PERIOD THE FARC LOST 42 MEN KILLED, </p><p>87 WOUNDED, AND 242 WEAPONS OF DIFFERENT TYPES </p><p>CAPTURED BY THE ARMED FORCES.  THE ARTICLE ALSO </p><p>REPORTED THAT FARC COLUMNS HAVE BEEN FORCED TO ABANDON </p><p>15 ENCAMPMENTS AND HAVE REVEALED THE LOCATION OF 12 OF </p><p>THEIR 45 FRONTS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  COMMENT:  EVEN MAKING ALLOWANCES FOR POSSIBLY </p><p>EXAGGERATED MILITARY REPORTING THAT LED TO THE </p><p>NEWSPAPER ACCOUNTS, IT APPEARS THAT THE MILITARY HAS </p><p>CHALKED UP A RARE SUCCESS BASED ON A WELL EXECUTED </p><p>OPERATION IN META.  FARC LOSSES DURING THEIR SEPTEMBER </p><p>AND OCTOBER OFFENSIVES MAY EXPLAIN GOC THINKING, AS </p><p>REVEALED RECENTLY BY PRESIDENTIAL COUNSELORS RAFAEL </p><p>AND RODRIGO PARDO ON SEPARATE OCCASIONS TO EMBOFFS, </p><p>THAT THE GUERRILLAS COULD NOT KEEP UP THEIR HIGH RATE </p><p>OF ACTIONS, AND WOULD LIKELY TURN TO POLITICAL </p><p>INITIATIVES.  WE CAN SEE THE LATTER ALREADY UNDERWAY </p><p>WITH THE FARC/M-19 TRYING TO USE THE LEYVA DURAN PEACE </p><p>PLAN TO PRESSURE THE GOC INTO A CEASEFIRE AGREEMENT </p><p>(SEE BOGOTA 18283). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MCNAMARA </p><p></p></div>
