<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 06 ANKARA 009054 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EB/TPP/MTA/MST-AWHITTEN </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA </p><p>DEPT PLEASE PASS USTR FOR GBLUE/DBIRDSEY </p><p>FAS FOR ITP/THORBURN </p><p>USDOC FOR ITA/MAC/DDEFALCO </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, EINV, EFIN, ECON, KIPR, TU </p><p>SUBJECT:  DRAFT NATIONAL TRADE ESTIMATE REPORT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Ref: STATE 225281 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The following is Embassy\'s input for the National Trade </p><p>Estimate Report for Turkey: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>TRADE SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turkey is a beneficiary of GSP, has Bilateral </p><p>Investment and Tax Treaties with the United States, and </p><p>is a member of the EU Customs Union.  (Trade/investment </p><p>statistics to be provided by Washington agencies). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>IMPORT POLICIES </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Tariffs and Quantitative Restrictions </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>As a result of its 1996 customs union with the European </p><p>Union, Turkey applies the EU\'s common external customs </p><p>tariff for third country (including U.S.) imports and </p><p>imposes no duty on non-agricultural items from EU and </p><p>European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries.  The </p><p>weighted rate of protection for industrial products </p><p>from the United States and other third countries </p><p>dropped to 4.65 percent at the end of 2001.  Turkey\'s </p><p>harmonization of trade and customs regulations with </p><p>those of the EU and the overall decline in tariff rates </p><p>is benefiting third country exporters as well. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turkey maintains high tariff rates on many agricultural </p><p>and food products to protect domestic producers. </p><p>Duties for paddy and milled rice were recently raised </p><p>to 38 and 46 percent respectively.   Corn and milling </p><p>wheat duties were reduced to 10 percent in early 2002, </p><p>however the duty on corn was increased to 40 percent </p><p>during the local harvest season and has yet to be </p><p>reduced again.  In recent years, tariff rates for these </p><p>grains have been raised to prohibitively high levels in </p><p>the months following the domestic harvest.  Barley </p><p>duties are maintained at 85 percent year-round.  High </p><p>feed input prices have resulted in high prices for </p><p>poultry and beef, and have negatively impacted local </p><p>industries.  Under its EU customs union and other </p><p>bilateral agreements, Turkey imports about 230,000 tons </p><p>of milling wheat, 100,000 tons durum and 28,000 tons of </p><p>rice duty-free.  Duties on fruits range from 61 percent </p><p>(apples) to 149 percent (bananas).  For processed </p><p>vegetables and fruits/fruit juices tariffs range from </p><p>41 to 138 percent.  The Turkish Government also levies </p><p>high duties, as well as excise taxes and other domestic </p><p>charges, on imported alcoholic beverages that increase </p><p>wholesale prices by more than 200 percent.  Turkey does </p><p>not permit any meat imports. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Import Licenses and other Restrictions </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>While import licenses generally are not required for </p><p>industrial products, products which need after-sales </p><p>service (e.g., photocopiers, ADP equipment, diesel </p><p>generators) require licenses.  Non-tariff barriers </p><p>result in costly delays, demurrage charges, and other </p><p>uncertainties that stifle trade for many agricultural </p><p>products.  Changes in import policies are not always </p><p>notified as required by WTO obligations.  Import </p><p>permits for some products that previously were issued </p><p>by Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs (MARA) </p><p>officials at ports of entry must now be cleared by </p><p>headquarters in Ankara.  MARA is currently revising its </p><p>technical import requirements to harmonize with EU </p><p>standards.  In the interim, for many products, no </p><p>written standards exist.  Wheat import permits are only </p><p>issued to flour product exporters and EU-quota holders. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The MARA also stopped issuing permits for paddy rice </p><p>during the domestic rice harvest period in 2001 and </p><p>2002, and applied quantitative restrictions during the </p><p>rest of the year, which seriously constrained U.S. </p><p>export sales.   Many quantitative and non-tariff </p><p>barriers for bananas have recently been resolved, </p><p>however the 149 percent tariff has had a significant </p><p>negative affect on trade. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The import process for alcoholic beverages is </p><p>exceedingly complicated, requiring both MARA control </p><p>certificates and TEKEL (a parastatal company) permits </p><p>which strictly limit trade and distribution channels </p><p>and are made available under only limited and </p><p>unpredictable circumstances.  The government is </p><p>preparing TEKEL for privatization, but it is still </p><p>unclear to what degree competition will be permitted in </p><p>this sector. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STANDARDS, TESTING, LABELING AND CERTIFICATION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The GOT has not notified a number of changes in import </p><p>policies and phytosanitary requirements to the WTO. </p><p>These changes are often communicated verbally, rather </p><p>than in writing, with varying levels of enforcement. </p><p>In recent years, it has become more difficult for </p><p>importers to obtain sanitary and phytosanitary </p><p>certifications.  For instance, MARA has begun to </p><p>require official certification for laboratory results </p><p>on certain food ingredient imports, including dioxin </p><p>levels.  U.S. regulatory agencies do not require such </p><p>testing or certify these types of results. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>While import licenses generally are not required for </p><p>industrial products, products which need after-sales </p><p>service (e.g., office equipment, white goods, </p><p>electronic and electrical consumer products, ADP </p><p>equipment, diesel generators) and medical and </p><p>agricultural commodities require licenses.  In </p><p>addition, the government requires laboratory tests and </p><p>certification that quality standards are met for the </p><p>importation of foods, human and veterinary drugs, and </p><p>medical equipment and appliances intended for use by </p><p>humans. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turkey is not a signatory of the WTO Government </p><p>Procurement Agreement.  Although its laws require </p><p>competitive bidding procedures for tenders, U.S. </p><p>companies sometimes become frustrated over lengthy and </p><p>often complicated bidding and negotiating processes. </p><p>Some tenders, especially large projects involving co- </p><p>production, are frequently opened, closed, revised, and </p><p>opened again.  There are often numerous requests for </p><p>"best offers." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In 2002, parliament approved a new public tender law </p><p>which establishes a board to oversee public tenders, </p><p>and lowers the minimum bidding threshold at which </p><p>foreign companies can participate in state tenders. </p><p>However, the law has not yet been implemented. </p><p>Military procurement generally requires an offset </p><p>provision in tender specifications when the estimated </p><p>value of the imported goods or services exceeds five </p><p>million dollars.  The entry into force of a Bilateral </p><p>Tax Treaty between the United States and Turkey in 1998 </p><p>eliminated the application of a 15 percent withholding </p><p>tax on U.S. bidders for Turkish government contracts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EXPORT SUBSIDIES </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turkey employs a number of incentives to promote </p><p>exports, although programs have been scaled back in </p><p>recent years to comply with EU directives and WTO </p><p>standards.  Historically, wheat and sugar were the main </p><p>subsidized commodities.  In 2001, Turkey exceeded its </p><p>WTO obligations for subsidized barley exports.  The </p><p>Turkish Eximbank provides exporters with credits, </p><p>guarantees, and insurance programs.  Certain tax </p><p>credits also are available to exporters. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS (IPR) PROTECTION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In 1995, the Turkish Parliament approved new patent, </p><p>trademark and copyright laws in connection with </p><p>preparations for Turkey\'s customs union with the EU. </p><p>Turkey also acceded to a number of multilateral </p><p>intellectual property rights (IPR) conventions, </p><p>including the 1971 Paris Act of the Berne Copyright </p><p>Convention.  In 2001, the Parliament enacted amendments </p><p>to the copyright law which provide retroactive </p><p>protection, expand the list of protected items and </p><p>include deterrent penalties against piracy.  These </p><p>amendments brought Turkey into compliance with the WTO </p><p>Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual </p><p>Property Rights (TRIPS) in most areas.  In recognition </p><p>of Turkey\'s progress in the IPR area, USTR removed </p><p>Turkey from its Special 301 Priority Watch List and </p><p>placed the country on its Watch List in 2001. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Although intellectual property holders have praised </p><p>Turkey\'s new legislation as a significant improvement </p><p>in the legal regime, implementing regulations in the </p><p>area of broadcasting include an arbitration provision </p><p>which could lead to compulsory licensing of musical and </p><p>possibly other works.   In the software area, piracy </p><p>rates have come down in recent years following an anti- </p><p>piracy campaign and a directive to legalize software </p><p>used in government bodies.  Trademark holders contend </p><p>that there is widespread and often sophisticated </p><p>counterfeiting of their marks in Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turkey\'s 1995 patent law replaced a law originally </p><p>passed in 1879.  New trademark, industrial design, and </p><p>geographic indicator laws were passed at the same time, </p><p>completely revamping Turkey\'s foundation for industrial </p><p>property protection.  Turkey also adhered to a number </p><p>of international conventions in 1995, including the </p><p>Stockholm Act of the Paris Convention, the Patent </p><p>Cooperation Treaty, and the Strasbourg Agreement. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In accordance with the 1995 patent law and Turkey\'s </p><p>agreement with the EU, patent protection for </p><p>pharmaceuticals began on January 1, 1999.  Turkey has </p><p>been accepting patent applications since 1996 in </p><p>compliance with the TRIPS agreement "mailbox" </p><p>provisions.  The patent law does not, however, contain </p><p>interim protection for pharmaceuticals in the R&D </p><p>"pipeline."  Lack of data exclusivity protection, which </p><p>is required by the TRIPS agreement, is the key concern </p><p>for research-based pharmaceuticals companies. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turkish police and prosecutors are working closely with </p><p>trademark, patent, and copyright holders to conduct </p><p>raids against pirates within Turkey.  Although several </p><p>cases have been brought to conclusion successfully, </p><p>U.S. industry believes continued enforcement efforts </p><p>are needed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SERVICES BARRIERS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Accounting </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Foreigners are not permitted to acquire, own an </p><p>interest in, form a partnership with, merge with, </p><p>establish, or affiliate with Turkish accounting firms. </p><p>Owners and employees of accounting firms established in </p><p>Turkey cannot acquire, own an interest in, form a </p><p>partnership with, merge with, establish, or affiliate </p><p>with foreign firms.  Names of foreign or affiliated </p><p>firms cannot be used in the legal name of an auditing </p><p>partnership or corporation, and cannot be used on </p><p>letterheads and business cards. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Regulations prohibit the formation of partnerships </p><p>among partners of different levels and titles.  Also, </p><p>qualified non-Turkish auditors are not permitted to </p><p>practice on a basis equal to qualified Turkish auditors </p><p>because of non-recognition of foreign-country </p><p>professional certification and foreign education, and </p><p>because of nationality requirements. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Legal Services </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The practice of Turkish law and membership of the bar </p><p>is restricted to Turkish nationals.  A person cannot </p><p>provide legal advice on foreign or international law </p><p>without being licensed in the practice of Turkish law. </p><p>Turkish lawyers are not permitted to form partnerships </p><p>with foreign lawyers.  However, some foreign law firms </p><p>have established liaison or branch offices in Turkey, </p><p>staffed by Turkish lawyers. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Architecture and Engineering </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Licensing of architects and engineers is limited to </p><p>Turkish nationals.  The Turkish government has </p><p>discretionary authority to grant a percentage </p><p>preference to domestic firms on public construction </p><p>projects.  Licensing of architects and engineers is </p><p>limited to Turkish nationals.  However, some large </p><p>infrastructure projects including dams, power plants, </p><p>highways, and railways are tendered for international </p><p>firms.  The foreign firms usually have local partners. </p><p>All projects with foreign currency or foreign credit </p><p>guarantees allocated by the Turkish Treasury and State </p><p>Planning Organization are open to foreign engineering </p><p>and construction companies.  However, Turkish Treasury </p><p>guarantees for new projects have been significantly </p><p>reduced in order to meet strict fiscal goals under </p><p>Turkey\'s IMF program. </p><p>Telecommunications Services </p><p>State-owned Turk Telekom currently provides voice </p><p>telephony and most value-added and basic </p><p>telecommunications services.  The Turkish government </p><p>plans to privatize Turk Telekom, with the government </p><p>retaining a single "golden" (blocking) share.  Foreign </p><p>investors will be able to acquire up to 45 percent of </p><p>Turk Telekom.  The United States has urged the Turkish </p><p>government to pursue full and complete privatization. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In the WTO negotiations on Basic Telecommunications </p><p>Services, Turkey made commitments to provide market </p><p>access and national treatment for all services at the </p><p>end of 2005, and permitted value-added </p><p>telecommunications services to be licensed to the </p><p>private sector with a 49 percent limit on foreign </p><p>equity investment.  In the interim, Turkey committed to </p><p>provide national treatment for mobile, paging and </p><p>private data networks.  In 2000, the Turkish government </p><p>passed a law unilaterally accelerating the opening of </p><p>the market for basic telephone services to January 1, </p><p>2004.  A 2001 law provides for liberalization of areas </p><p>under the Turk Telecom monopoly once the state\'s share </p><p>in that company falls below 50 percent.  These laws </p><p>also created an independent regulatory body - the </p><p>Telecommunications Regulatory Board - and made </p><p>licensing criteria publicly available.  U.S. firms </p><p>complain that the licensing process still lacks </p><p>transparency and that revenue sharing with Turk Telecom </p><p>is required where competition is permitted.  There are </p><p>three private GSM cellular operators in Turkey, with a </p><p>fourth license held by Turk Telecom. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Other Services Barriers </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>There are restrictions on establishment in financial </p><p>services, the petroleum sector, broadcasting, aviation </p><p>and maritime transportation (see Investment Barriers </p><p>section). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>INVESTMENT BARRIERS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The U.S.-Turkish Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) </p><p>entered into force in May 1990.  Turkey has a liberal </p><p>investment regime in which foreign investments receive </p><p>national treatment.  There is a screening process for </p><p>foreign investments, which the government applies on an </p><p>MFN basis.  Once approved, firms with foreign capital </p><p>are treated as local companies.  Almost all areas open </p><p>to the Turkish private sector are fully open to foreign </p><p>participation, but establishments in the financial and </p><p>petroleum sectors require special permission.  The </p><p>equity participation ratio of foreign shareholders is </p><p>restricted to 20 percent in broadcasting and 49 percent </p><p>in aviation, value-added telecommunications services, </p><p>and maritime transportation.  Nonetheless, once </p><p>investors have committed to the Turkish market, they </p><p>sometimes find the rationale for their initial </p><p>investments significantly undercut by arbitrary </p><p>legislative action, such as laws imposing limits on the </p><p>production corn sweeteners. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Turkish government accepts binding international </p><p>arbitration of investment disputes between foreign </p><p>investors and the state; this principle is enshrined in </p><p>the U.S.-Turkish BIT.  For many years, there was an </p><p>exception for "concessions" involving private </p><p>(primarily foreign) investment in public services.  In </p><p>1999, the Parliament passed a package of amendments to </p><p>the constitution allowing foreign companies access to </p><p>international arbitration for concessionary contracts. </p><p>In 2000, the Turkish government completed implementing </p><p>legislation for arbitration.  In 2001, the Parliament </p><p>approved a law further expanding the scope of </p><p>international arbitration in Turkish contracts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>While Turkey\'s legal regime for foreign investment is </p><p>liberal, private sector investment is often hindered, </p><p>regardless of nationality, by:  excessive bureaucracy; </p><p>political and macroeconomic uncertainty; weaknesses in </p><p>the judicial system; high tax rates; a weak framework </p><p>for corporate governance; and frequent, sometimes </p><p>unclear changes in the legal and regulatory </p><p>environment.  The Turkish government is considering </p><p>legal and other changes to reduce red tape and </p><p>dismantle other barriers to investment.  Key changes </p><p>under discussion include:  elimination of screening of </p><p>foreign investors in favor of a notification system; </p><p>national treatment for foreign-owned entities in </p><p>acquisition of real estate; abolition of specific </p><p>minimum capital requirements for foreign investors. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turkey is a member of several international dispute </p><p>settlement bodies.  Nevertheless, until 1999, Turkish </p><p>courts did not recognize investors\' rights to third </p><p>party arbitration under any contract defined as a </p><p>concession.  This was particularly problematic in the </p><p>energy, telecommunications and transportation sectors. </p><p>Constitutional amendments, accepted by the Parliament </p><p>in 1999 granting access to international arbitration to </p><p>foreign investors, largely corrected this problem. </p><p>Investors in these sectors often expressed concern </p><p>about the lack of clarity in the government approval </p><p>process, lack of lender\'s step-in rights, the lack of </p><p>lender rights to termination, and disparities between </p><p>the rights of lenders and the rights of the Turkish </p><p>Government to claim force majeure.  The Turkish </p><p>government passed legislation in February 2001 that </p><p>will introduce a fully liberalized energy market in </p><p>Turkey, under which private firms will develop projects </p><p>with the approval of an independent regulatory body. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ANTICOMPETITIVE PRACTICES </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>As part of its customs union agreement with the EU, </p><p>Turkey has pledged to adopt EU standards concerning </p><p>competition and consumer protection.  In 1997, a </p><p>government "Competition Board" commenced operations, </p><p>putting into force a 1994 competition law.  Government </p><p>monopolies in a number of areas, particularly alcoholic </p><p>beverages and telecommunications services, have been </p><p>scaled back in recent years, but currently remain a </p><p>barrier to certain U.S. products and services. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Corruption </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CORRUPTION IS PERCEIVED TO BE A MAJOR PROBLEM IN </p><p>TURKEY BY PRIVATE ENTERPRISE AND THE PUBLIC AT </p><p>LARGE.  THE TURKISH GOVERNMENT CONDUCTED TWO </p><p>SIGNIFICANT ANTI-CORRUPTION OPERATIONS IN 2001, </p><p>ONE IN THE ENERGY MINISTRY AND THE OTHER IN THE </p><p>PUBLIC WORKS MINISTRY.  SEVERAL INDIVIDUALS WERE </p><p>CHARGED WITH CORRUPTION AND WRONGDOING IN </p><p>GOVERNMENT CONTRACT TENDERS.  THE OPERATIONS </p><p>RESULTED IN THE RESIGNATION OF BOTH MINISTERS </p><p>AND THE ARREST OF MANY HIGH-LEVEL OFFICIALS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Corruption appears to be most problematic in government </p><p>procurement, with frequent allegations that contracts </p><p>are awarded on the basis of personal and political </p><p>relationships of businesspersons and government </p><p>officials.  The judicial system is also perceived to be </p><p>susceptible to external political and commercial </p><p>influence to some degree. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turkey has ratified the OECD antibribery convention, </p><p>but has not yet passed the relevant implementing </p><p>legislation which would explicitly provide that bribes </p><p>of foreign officials, as well as domestic, are illegal </p><p>and not tax deductible. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>U.S. firms have sometimes alleged that corruption, or </p><p>at a minimum nontransparent practices, have been a </p><p>barrier to direct foreign investment.  American </p><p>companies operating in Turkey have complained about </p><p>contributions to the community solicited, with varying </p><p>degrees of pressure, by municipal or local authorities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>OTHER BARRIERS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Energy:  Over the last 5-7 years, U.S. firms have spent </p><p>tens of millions of dollars pursuing contracts for </p><p>power projects using the build-operate-transfer (BOT) </p><p>and transfer-of-operating-rights (TOR) models.  The </p><p>constitutional court ruled in April 1992 that the GOT </p><p>would have to either honor the contracts or compensate </p><p>the companies involved.  To date, the GOT has not </p><p>commenced negotiations with the companies, one of which </p><p>has launched an international arbitration case. </p><p>Because of the delay, the companies are now required to </p><p>submit license applications to the Energy Market </p><p>Regulatory Board (EMRA), which took control of such </p><p>licenses in September.  In addition, BOT projects </p><p>already in operation filed suit against EMRA on October </p><p>2002, claiming that the license requirement was in </p><p>violation of their implementing contracts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Cola tax:  Punitive taxation of cola drinks (raised in </p><p>2002 to 47.5 percent under Turkey\'s new "Special </p><p>Consumption Tax") discourages investment by major U.S. </p><p>cola producers. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Corporate Governance:  Weaknesses in the protection of </p><p>minority shareholder rights and regulatory oversight </p><p>have left some American companies at a disadvantage in </p><p>disputes with Turkish partners. </p><p></p></div>
