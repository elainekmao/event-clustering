<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 001171 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR J FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR C. GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR C. NEARY </p><p>BANGKOK FOR WIN DAYTON </p><p>DS/OP/AF </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/09/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PINR, ASEC, ZI, MDC </p><p>SUBJECT: TSVANGIRAI FACES NEW TREASON CHARGES, AWAITS BAIL </p><p>HEARING: MUGABE DERIDES MDC, CONDEMNS OUTSIDE INTERFERENCE </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: POLITICAL OFFICER PEGGY BLACKFORD FOR REASONS 1.5B/D </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>-------- </p><p>1. (C)  AFTER A WEEK OF MASS ACTION WHICH PRODUCED LESS THAN </p><p>THE OPPOSITION WOULD HAVE LIKED, MDC LEADER, MORGAN </p><p>TSVANGIRAI FOUND HIMSELF UNDER ARREST FOR TREASON ONCE AGAIN. </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> HE SPENT THE WEEKEND IN JAIL AND IS CURRENTLY AWAITING A </p><p>RULING IN A BAIL HEARING.  PRESIDENT MUGABE SOUNDED </p><p>TRIUMPHANT IN SPEECHES OVER THE WEEKEND GLOATING OVER HIS </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S ABILITY TO PREVENT DEMONSTRATIONS AND PLACING </p><p>THE BLAME FOR "ILLEGAL" ACTIONS ON THE MDC AND ITS </p><p>SUPPORTERS, THE BRITISH AND US EMBASSIES.  NEGOTIATIONS MAY </p><p>BE MORE DIFFICULT IF THE GOZ BELIEVES IT NOW HAS THE UPPER </p><p>HAND. </p><p> </p><p>MDC LEADER PUTS POSITIVE SPIN ON WEEK\'S EVENTS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) AT A PRESS CONFERENCE HELD EARLY ON THE AFTERNOON OF </p><p>JUNE 6 AT THE HOME OF THE MDC LEADER, MORGAN TSVANGIRAI TOLD </p><p>JOURNALISTS AND DIPLOMATS THAT HE VIEWED THE WEEK\'S MASS </p><p>ACTION AS A SUCCESS.  THE STAYAWAY HAD BEEN WIDELY SUPPORTED </p><p>AND THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE HAD ONLY PREVENTED MASS </p><p>DEMONSTRATIONS BY MASSIVE AND WIDESPREAD USE OF THE POLICE </p><p>AND MILITARY.  HE PROMISED THAT ROLLING MASS ACTIONS WOULD </p><p>CONTINUE WITHOUT NOTICE. </p><p> </p><p>TSVANGIRAI ARRESTED ANEW ON FRESH TREASON CHARGES </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  SHORTLY AFTER THE CONCLUSION OF THE PRESS CONFERENCE, </p><p>TSVANGIRAI WAS PICKED UP BY POLICE AND CHARGED WITH TREASON </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>FOR ALLEGEDLY CALLING ON ZIMBABWEANS TO OUST MUGABE FROM </p><p>POWER IN A NUMBER OF PUBLIC GATHERINGS OVER THE LAST FEW </p><p>MONTHS.  HE WAS INCARCERATED AT THE BORROWDALE POLICE STATION </p><p>OVER THE WEEKEND.  ACCORDING TO SPECIAL PRESIDENTIAL ADVISOR, </p><p>GANDI MUDZINGWA, SEVERAL HIGH RANKING GOZ OFFICIALS INCLUDING </p><p>THE MINISTER FOR STATE SECURITY AND THE HEAD OF THE CENTRAL </p><p>INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATION SOUGHT TO TALK TO TSVANGIRAI BUT HE </p><p>WAS ALLOWED NO VISITORS EXCEPT FOR HIS WIFE.  FATHER FIDELIS </p><p>MUKONORI, WHO HAS BEEN TRYING TO FACILITATE DIALOGUE BETWEEN </p><p>TSVANGIRAI AND MUGABE, ALSO SOUGHT TO SEE THE MDC LEADER AND </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>TOLD MUDZINGWA THAT HE WAS TRYING TO ARRANGE A MEETING </p><p>BETWEEN TSVANGIRAI AND MUGABE FOR THURSDAY.  MUDZINGWA WAS </p><p>SKEPTICAL THAT SUCH A MEETING WOULD TAKE PLACE.  WELSHMAN </p><p>NCUBE, SECRETARY-GENERAL OF THE MDC, WAS ALSO BEING SOUGHT </p><p>AND, AFTER STAYING OUT OF SIGHT FOR THE WEEKEND, HE PRESENTED </p><p>HIMSELF FOR QUESTIONING BY THE POLICE MONDAY MORNING IN THE </p><p>COMPANY OF HIS ATTORNEY. </p><p> </p><p>TSVANGIRAI BAIL HEARING PENDING </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) AS OF LATE THIS AFTERNOON, JUNE 9, JUDGE GARWE WHO </p><p>IS PRESIDING OVER THE ONGOING TREASON TRIAL BEFORE THE HIGH </p><p>COURT DISMISSED THE GOVERNMENT\'S APPLICATION TO AMEND CURRENT </p><p>BAIL CONDITIONS WHICH WOULD HAVE PREVENTED TSVANGIRAI FROM </p><p>SPEAKING IN PUBLIC.  HE REFUSED, HOWEVER, TO ENTERTAIN THE </p><p>DEFENSE\'S APPLICATION FOR BAIL ON THE NEW CHARGES SAYING THAT </p><p>THE MAGISTRATES COURT HAS JURISDICTION IN SUCH MATTERS UNLESS </p><p>THERE IS CONCURRENCE WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL\'S OFFICE.  THE </p><p>DEFENSE AND THE A.G. REACHED AGREEMENT ON THIS ISSUE AND BAIL </p><p>WILL BE CONSIDERED TOMORROW MORNING BY THE HIGH COURT JUDGE </p><p>ON DUTY. </p><p> </p><p>MUGABE CLAIMS VICTORY, WARNS OUTSIDERS ABOUT INTERFERING </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) BY LAST WEEK\'S END, PRESIDENT MUGABE WAS CLEARLY </p><p>FEELING THAT HE HAD COME OUT AHEAD.  AT A RALLY IN THE </p><p>COUNTRYSIDE ON FRIDAY, JUNE 6, HE JOKED WITH AN AUDIENCE OF </p><p>SUPPORTERS ABOUT THE MDC AND WAS SCORNFUL OF TSVANGIRAI\'S </p><p>ASPIRATIONS TO THE PRESIDENCY.  ACCORDING TO THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>OWNED HERALD, HE WAS QUOTED AS LIKENING THE MDC LEADER TO A </p><p>MAN REJECTED BY A WOMEN WHO NONETHELESS CONTINUES TO PURSUE </p><p>HER.  ON SATURDAY AT THE FUNERAL OF MAMA MAFUYANE, WIDOW OF </p><p>THE LATE VICE-PRESIDENT JOSHUA NKOMO, THE PRESIDENT TOOK THIS </p><p>RATHER INAPPROPRIATE OPPORTUNITY TO TELL THE BRITISH AND US </p><p>EMBASSIES TO STOP HELPING THE MDC ACHIEVE AN ILLEGAL </p><p>OBJECTIVE AND TO WARN THAT "THEIR INSTIGATION CANNOT BE </p><p>TOLERATED FOREVER BY MY GOVERNMENT."  A THOUSAND OR SO </p><p>ZANU-PF SUPPORTERS IN THEIR BRAND NEW "NO TO MASS ACTION" </p><p>T-SHIRTS APPLAUDED ENTHUSIASTICALLY. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  ALTHOUGH LAST WEEK\'S MASS ACTION WAS SUCCESSFUL IN </p><p>CLOSING DOWN MOST BUSINESS IN HARARE AND OTHER CITIES, IT WAS </p><p>SOMETHING OF A PR FAILURE.  TSVANGIRAI APPARENTLY </p><p>OVERESTIMATED HIS SUPPORTERS\' COURAGE IN THE FACE OF PROBABLE </p><p>VIOLENCE.  HIS ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THE MDC HAD CANCELED </p><p>DEMONSTRATIONS FOR FEAR OF INJURY TO THE PUBLIC SEEMED TO BE </p><p>SPINNING THE NEWS AS BEST HE COULD.  CERTAINLY MUGABE IS </p><p>REACTING AS THOUGH HE IS FIRMLY IN CHARGE AND CAPABLE OF </p><p>DEALING WITH ANY PESKY OPPOSITION THAT MIGHT ARISE.  IF HE </p><p>SINCERELY BELIEVES THIS, IT DOES NOT BODE WELL FOR SERIOUS </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS.  NONETHELESS, THE TRAIPSING OF ZANU-PF AND </p><p>GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS TO TSVANGIRAI SHOWS THAT THE REGIME </p><p>RECOGNIZES THAT IT HAS NO WAY OUT OF THE COUNTRY\'S CRISIS. </p><p>IN THAT CONTEXT, HEIGHTENING PRESSURE ON TSVANGIRAI AND THE </p><p>MDC THROUGH NEW TREASON CHARGES AND DETENTION CAN BE ANOTHER </p><p>WAY TO WEAKEN THE OPPONENT PRIOR TO UNAVOIDABLE DIALOGUE. </p><p>END COMMENT </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
