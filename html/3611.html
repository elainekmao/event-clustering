<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L HARARE 002001 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/30/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: LEADING HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVIST ARRESTED </p><p> </p><p>REF: HARARE 1984 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: political section chief Matt Harrington.  Reasons: 1.5 ( </p><p>B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) On August 29, police detained Frances Lovemore, </p><p>acting director of Zimbabwe\'s leading human rights </p><p>organization, Amani Trust.  She was charged with violating </p><p>the section of the repressive Public Order and Security Act </p><p>(POSA) which prohibits publication of "falsehoods" </p><p>prejudicial to the state.  After questioning her at the </p><p>Harare Central Police Station in the company of a lawyer, </p><p>police bundled her into a vehicle and took her to an </p><p>undisclosed location.  She was detained incommunicado </p><p>overnight, and her attorneys were not provided access to her </p><p>until late in the morning on August 30, after the </p><p>Attorney-General\'s office intervened at the behest of her </p><p>lawyer. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) The saga began in the morning of August 29, when </p><p>police detectives appeared at the offices of Amani Trust with </p><p>a warrant authorizing a search for "subversive materials" in </p><p>Lovemore\'s possession.  Police searched her office and </p><p>confiscated a report from Amnesty International, a copy of </p><p>the UN Convention Against Torture, and a number of political </p><p>violence reports produced regularly by the UN Human Rights </p><p>NGO Forum.  Lovemore was then taken to Harare Central Police </p><p>station, where she was questioned about international media </p><p>reports quoting Lovemore as saying rape was being used by </p><p>ZANU-PF youth militias as a political weapon.  The group then </p><p>returned to conduct a wider search of Amani\'s offices </p><p>(ignoring the restrictions in the search warrant), and </p><p>returned to the police station.  Lovemore was asked to sign a </p><p>"warned and cautioned" statement, then was formally charged </p><p>under POSA. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Lovemore is expected to appear in court for a bail </p><p>hearing on the morning of August 30, and the </p><p>Attorney-General\'s office has told her attorney it will not </p><p>oppose the granting of bail.  One of her attorneys told us </p><p>that Lovemore appeared physically okay after her overnight </p><p>detention, but was hungry because she had been provided no </p><p>food during the previous 24 hours.  In addition, she had </p><p>spent a very cold night in the cell, as she had not been </p><p>given a blanket or the opportunity to obtain clothing warmer </p><p>than the light dress she was wearing at the time of her </p><p>arrest. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Lovemore\'s arrest came only several hours after the </p><p>bombing of the office of an independent radio station </p><p>(reftel), so it was not a good day for freedom of speech in </p><p>Zimbabwe.  Lovemore told us earlier in the week she was </p><p>alarmed by a significant increase in the numbers of </p><p>apparently politically-motivated rapes reported to her </p><p>office, and she has worked hard to publicize this troubling </p><p>development.  The Government of Zimbabwe has grown </p><p>increasingly annoyed by the international media\'s focus on </p><p>this issue, and it clearly blames Lovemore.  Although </p><p>Jonathan Moyo and his propaganda machine have, in the past, </p><p>leveled all sorts of venomous attacks against Amani Trust, </p><p>this time the GOZ has upped the ante.  The outrageous </p><p>treatment of Lovemore appears to be a shot across the bow for </p><p>other human rights and civic organizations, and we suspect </p><p>that a GOZ crackdown against other segments of civil society </p><p>is not far off. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
