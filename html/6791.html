<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L GUATEMALA 000784 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/25/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PREL, CU, GT, UNHRC-1 </p><p>SUBJECT: GUATEMALA RESPONSE TO CUBAN CRACKDOWN AGAINST </p><p>OPPOSITION </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 75175 </p><p> </p><p>     B. GUATEMALA 770 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: PolCouns David Lindwall for reason 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) In a March 22 meeting with President Alfonso Portillo, </p><p>the Ambassador raised USG concerns (Ref A) over the Cuban </p><p>crackdown against the opposition.  As noted in Ref B, </p><p>Portillo acknowledged that the arrests carried out by the </p><p>Cuban Government were worrisome, but stopped short of </p><p>committing the GOG to issuing a public statement condemning </p><p>the arrests. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The Ambassador raised the matter again with Vice </p><p>President Francisco Reyes Lopez on March 25, noting that </p><p>failure by the international community to condemn these </p><p>arrests would undermine those who are trying to bring about </p><p>peaceful democratic change in Cuba.  The Ambassador added </p><p>that the dissidents, who were simply exercising rights that </p><p>all other inhabitants of the hemisphere have, look to the UN </p><p>Commission on Human Rights as a forum where the international </p><p>community calls on the Cuban Government to respect their </p><p>basic human rights.  Failure by Guatemala to vote for a </p><p>resolution calling on the Cuban Government to respect basic </p><p>human rights, especially in view of the recent wave of </p><p>arrests, would be a severe blow to these individuals who are </p><p>paying for their defense of human rights with incarceration. </p><p>The Ambassador asked the Vice President what arguments </p><p>opponents of this resolution could possibly have to oppose a </p><p>call on the Cuban Government to respect basic human rights. </p><p>Vice President Reyes dodged the question and blamed "the </p><p>Congress" for opposition to Guatemala voting with us in favor </p><p>of a Cuba resolution.  He said, however, that no decision had </p><p>been made regarding the vote, and did not rule out that the </p><p>recent wave of arrests would be weighed at the moment </p><p>Guatemala decided on its vote. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The Ambassador was to deliver the talking points to </p><p>Foreign Minister Gutierrez on March 25, but the Foreign </p><p>Minister canceled the meeting due to illness.  In his stead, </p><p>the Ambassador spoke with Vice Foreign Minister Jorge Perez </p><p>and raised the same concerns.  Perez promised to relay our </p><p>views to the Foreign Minister and inform us of any response. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) PolCouns met with MFA Director of Multilateral Affairs </p><p>Giovanni Castillo on March 25 to deliver Ref A demarche and </p><p>talking points.  Castillo said the GOG was aware of the </p><p>arrest of dissidents by the Cuban regime, and said he would </p><p>forward to the Foreign Minister our request for the GOG to </p><p>make a public statement in support of the dissidents.  He </p><p>asked if other countries in the hemisphere had made </p><p>statements.  Castillo said he would inform us of any decision </p><p>by the GOG in this regard. </p><p>HAMILTON </p><p></p></div>
