<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001092 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>AF/PD FOR COX AND ROBERTSON, AF/S FOR KRAFT AND </p><p>SCHLACHTER, AF/RA FOR DIPALMA, INR/R/MR </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ZI, KPAO </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REPORT FRENCH ELECTION; HARARE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.   Under headline "Chirac\'s massive victory: The </p><p>   lesson for African leaders" the independent daily "The </p><p>   Daily News" dedicated its May 7 editorial to hailing </p><p>   French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac\'s resounding </p><p>   defeat of Jean-Marie Le Pen in Sunday\'s run-off as a </p><p>   "reaffirmation" of the dangers of political extremism. </p><p>   Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>2.   ".Jacques Chirac\'s massive victory over the racist </p><p>   Jean-Marie Le Pen was welcomed with the same Phew! by </p><p>   many Africans in Francophone Africa as the headline </p><p>   used in one French newspaper. </p><p> </p><p>   ".What the people of France did, albeit spurred by </p><p>   a fear of what the rest of Europe would think of </p><p>   them, was a reaffirmation of their commitment to </p><p>   freedom for all people, whatever their race and </p><p>   whatever their origins.  But for African leaders </p><p>   the lesson should be quite clear: Europe will not </p><p>   always drive the Le Pens in their midst into </p><p>   political wilderness.  When the chips are really </p><p>   down and their economies are pushed against the </p><p>   wall, some of the Europeans might vote for the </p><p>   racists.  Africans must get rid of their greedy </p><p>   leaders, by any means, before they accept the </p><p>   humiliation of being economic refugees." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
