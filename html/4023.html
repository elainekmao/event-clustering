<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ROME 005117 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SECDEF FOR BRZEZINSKI </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/17/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PARM, PREL, MARR, MCAP, IT, NATO </p><p>SUBJECT: MISSILE DEFENSE FOLLOW-UP WITH ITALIANS </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 195489 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: POL-MIN COUNSELOR THOMAS COUNTRYMAN FOR REASONS 1.5(B), </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  05117  211158Z </p><p>(D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) THE GOI IS INTERESTED IN CONTINUING BILATERAL </p><p>DISCUSSIONS ON MISSILE DEFENSE BUT WANTS FURTHER DISCUSSIONS </p><p>WITHIN NATO TO DEVELOP FURTHER A COMMON CONCEPTUAL APPROACH </p><p>TO THE PROGRAM, ACCORDING TO MINISTER CARLO TREZZA, MFA </p><p>COORDINATOR FOR INTERNATIONAL SECURITY AFFAIRS.  NATO </p><p>MEMBERS, AND THE GOI INTERNALLY, NEED TO CONSIDER THE </p><p>STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS OF SWITCHING FROM THEATER MISSILE </p><p>DEFENSE (TMD), WITH ITS FOCUS ON PROTECTING DEPLOYED TROOPS, </p><p>TO A BROADER MISSILE DEFENSE PROGRAM AIMED AT PROTECTING </p><p>POPULATIONS AND TERRITORIES, TREZZA TOLD POL-MIL COUNSELOR </p><p>DURING AN OCTOBER 17 MEETING. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) ITALIAN EMBASSY OFFICIALS IN WASHINGTON HAVE RECENTLY </p><p>HAD GENERAL DISCUSSIONS WITH PENTAGON REPRESENTATIVES ABOUT </p><p>POSSIBLE CONCRETE ITALIAN PARTICIPATION IN THE MD PROGRAM, </p><p>TREZZA SAID.  BUDGET CONSTRAINTS ARE A REAL PROBLEM BUT THE </p><p>GOI VIEWS MD AS A DEFENSE CAPABILITY ISSUE, ACCORDING TO </p><p>TREZZA.  BOTH THE MFA AND THE MOD ARE PRESSURING THE FINANCE </p><p>MINISTRY TO PRESERVE FUNDING FOR CAPABILITY PRIORITIES, HE </p><p>NOTED.  MORE DETAILS FROM THE USG ABOUT THE PROGRAM WOULD </p><p>MAKE IT EASIER FOR ITALY TO IDENTIFY SPECIFICALLY HOW IT CAN </p><p>CONTRIBUTE, TREZZA ADDED.  THE GOI WOULD WELCOME FURTHER </p><p>BILATERAL DISCUSSIONS, HE SAID, BUT HE EMPHASIZED THE </p><p>IMPORTANCE OF WORKING WITHIN NATO AS WELL. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) THE GOI SUPPORTS INCLUDING A REFERENCE TO MD IN THE </p><p>PRAGUE SUMMIT COMMUNIQUE AS A POLITICAL ENDORSEMENT OF THE </p><p>PROGRAM, AND AGREES IN PRINCIPLE TO EXTENDING THE NATO TMD </p><p>FEASIBILTY STUDY TO COVER POPULATIONS AND TERRITORIES, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  05117  211158Z </p><p>ACCORDING TO GIOVANNI BRAUZZI, MFA NATO AFFAIRS OFFICE </p><p>DIRECTOR.  BUT ITALY NEEDS TO CLOSELY EVALUATE THE </p><p>CONSEQUENCES OF SHIFTING FROM TMD TO MD BEFORE THE GOI CAN </p><p>FULLY SUPPORT THE PROPOSAL, HE SAID.  TO DO THIS, BRAUZZI </p><p>SAID, IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO HAVE THE SPECIFIC TERMS OF </p><p>REFERENCE OF THE EXPANDED FEASIBILITY STUDY. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) BOTH TREZZA AND BRAUZZI EXPRESSED ITALY\'S STRONG </p><p>INTEREST IN THE INDUSTRIAL COMPONENT OF THE MD PROGRAM. </p><p>BRAUZZI SAID ITALY WOULD LIKE TO BE A HIGHER LEVEL PARTNER </p><p>BUT ADDED THAT THAT WOULD DEPEND ON THE TYPE OF INDUSTRIAL </p><p>INTERACTION AVAILABLE.  TREZZA POINTED OUT THAT ITALIAN AND </p><p>US COMPANIES ARE ALREADY COORDINATING (A REFERENCE TO THE </p><p>ALENIA-BOEING MOU SIGNED IN JULY) BUT SAID THERE IS NO FORMAL </p><p>POLICY AT THE POLITICAL LEVEL BECAUSE OF THE NEED FOR FURTHER </p><p>DISCUSSIONS WITHIN NATO ON THE IMPACT OF THE SHIFT FROM TMD </p><p>TO MD.  AS AN EXAMPLE, HE NOTED SOME NATO MEMBERS HAD </p><p>EXPRESSED DOUBTS ABOUT THE THREAT ASSESSMENT PRESENTED AT THE </p><p>OCT. 15 EWG/SPC MEETING. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) COMMENT.  THE MD BRIEFINGS ITALIAN OFFICIALS HAVE </p><p>RECEIVED HAVE GENERATED SOME ENTHUSIASM FOR ITALIAN </p><p>PARTICIPATION IN THE PROPOSED MD FRAMEWORK.  ITALY IS </p><p>PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN INDUSTRIAL COOPERATION AS THE </p><p>PROGRAM DEVELOPS.  BILATERALLY, THE GOI WOULD LIKE MORE </p><p>INFORMATION ABOUT THE SPECIFICS OF THE PROGRAM IN ORDER TO </p><p>IDENTIFY WHERE AND HOW ITALY CAN CONTRIBUTE.  A USG TEAM </p><p>TAILORED TO ADDRESS INDUSTRIAL COOPERATION AND THE IMPACT OF </p><p>EXPANDING FROM TMD TO A BROADER PROGRAM IN PARTICULAR WOULD </p><p>HELP THE GOI DEVELOP TARGET HOW THEY CAN CONTRIBUTE.  NATO </p><p>DISCUSSIONS ELABORATING THE ALLIANCE\'S VISION FOR THE MD </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  05117  211158Z </p><p>PROGRAM WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE AN IMPORTANT INFLUENCE OVER THE </p><p>WAY THE PROPOSAL IS VIEWED, AND FUNDED, IN ROME.  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME05117 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
