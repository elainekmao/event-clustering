<p>UNCLAS ABU DHABI 001091 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR NEA, NEA/ARP, NEA/RA, DRL/CRA AND DRL/PHD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PREL, PGOV, ELAB, KEM, KSEP, TC </p><p>SUBJECT: UAE: USG HUMAN RIGHTS STRATEGY </p><p> </p><p>REF:  STATE 13796 </p><p> </p><p>1.  This cable has been coordinated with Congen Dubai. </p><p> </p><p>2.  We offer the following comments in response to reftel </p><p>request for a summary of Post\'s actions in 2002 to </p><p>encourage respect for human rights in the United Arab </p><p>Emirates. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Since its independence in 1971, the United Arab </p><p>Emirates has transcended rapidly from an undeveloped </p><p>country to a dynamic regional economic power with an </p><p>advanced infrastructure and a diverse urbanized population. </p><p>In the process, the UAE Government has granted increasing </p><p>protection for human rights in many areas.  Embassy Abu </p><p>Dhabi and Consulate Dubai have encouraged the continuation </p><p>and broadening of this progression through a strong public </p><p>diplomacy program and an active dialogue with all levels of </p><p>government and civil society. </p><p> </p><p>4.  Throughout the year, the Embassy and Consulate General </p><p>used public diplomacy programs to encourage respect for </p><p>human rights.  We utilized the numerous visits of U.S. </p><p>government officials, NGOs and private individuals as tools </p><p>to engage with the government, civil society and the public </p><p>through media interviews, lectures, roundtables and hosted </p><p>gatherings for various political, academic, and social </p><p>leaders.  We also used official functions to promote human </p><p>rights, for example, at the annual Independence Day </p><p>reception we used a photographic exhibition to highlight </p><p>the role of minorities and immigrants in the development of </p><p>our country. </p><p> </p><p>5.  We continued to highlight and promote the role of </p><p>women, journalists and civil society activists in a number </p><p>of ways.  To encourage the enhanced participation of women </p><p>in public life and business, the Ambassador met regularly </p><p>with UAE First Lady Shaykha Fatima Bint Mubarak and other </p><p>women leaders and hosted regular get-togethers for women </p><p>from numerous disciplines.  The Public Affairs Section </p><p>hosted a Ramadan iftar for journalists and embassy </p><p>officials, and awarded a public diplomacy grant to the </p><p>country\'s largest environmental NGO, which is led by an </p><p>Emirati woman. </p><p> </p><p>6.  At the encouragement of embassy and consulate </p><p>officials, a number of Emirati officials, academics, </p><p>journalists and other individuals participated in </p><p>International Visitor Programs and other exchanges and </p><p>conferences that included components promoting respect for </p><p>human rights.  For example, two police officers attended an </p><p>International Visitor Program on monitoring and combating </p><p>trafficking in persons.  And, the Embassy facilitated the </p><p>attendance of a Ministry of Justice official in a judicial </p><p>reform exchange program. </p><p> </p><p>7.  To highlight our commitment to the advancement and </p><p>protection of human rights in the area of trafficking in </p><p>persons, the Ambassador added trafficking in persons to the </p><p>agenda for the first U.S.-UAE Strategic Dialogue in </p><p>November 2002 to build on the excellent strides made by the </p><p>UAE Government in the implementation and enforcement of a </p><p>child camel jockey ban in September 2002.  And, furthering </p><p>the U.S. policy of promoting religious freedom, we </p><p>expressed concern to the UAEG about the prosecution of an </p><p>expatriate pastor for proselytizing. </p><p> </p><p>8.  In 2003, Post will continue to pursue an activist </p><p>approach with the UAEG.  An official visit in January 2003 </p><p>by Department of State officials from the Office to Monitor </p><p>and Combat Trafficking in Persons provided an excellent </p><p>opportunity to engage senior Emiratis on this important </p><p>transnational crime and human rights issue.  We will </p><p>continue to utilize the annual reports on human rights, </p><p>religious freedom and trafficking in persons as tools to </p><p>promote and encourage respect for human rights in the UAE. </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
