<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 BOGOTA 003159 </p><p></p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/08/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PHUM, PINR, SOCI, CO </p><p>SUBJECT: FARC RESUMES ATTACKS AGAINST CIVILIAN POPULATION </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR ANNE W. PATTERSON, REASONS: </p><p>1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) SUMMARY: FARC ACTIONS AGAINST THE MILITARY, THE </p><p>CIVILIAN POPULATION, AND COLOMBIA\'S INFRASTRUCTURE FLARED </p><p>DURING A THREE-WEEK PERIOD FOLLOWING THE END OF THE </p><p>DESPEJE.  SINCE THEN, FARC ACTIVITY AGAINST THE </p><p>POPULATION HAD BEEN MINIMAL, UNTIL THIS PAST WEEK: FROM </p><p>MARCH 24 TO 27, FARC REBELS ATTACKED THE TOWN OF SARAVENA </p><p>(ARAUCA DEPARTMENT) TWICE, DESTROYING SEVERAL GOC </p><p>OFFICES.  ON APRIL 5, INTERNATIONAL RED CROSS MEMBERS </p><p>RECOVERED THE BODIES OF TWO POLICEMEN MURDERED BY THE </p><p>FARC.  ONE WAS THE FATHER OF ANDRES FELIPE PEREZ, THE 13- </p><p>YEAR OLD CANCER PATIENT WHO DIED LAST DECEMBER, AFTER </p><p>REPEATED PLEAS TO THE FARC TO RELEASE HIS FATHER.  ON </p><p>APRIL 6, FARC OPERATIVES EXPLODED TWO BOMBS IN A POPULAR </p><p>NIGHT SPOT IN VILLAVICENCIO, KILLING 12 AND INJURING 100 </p><p>OTHERS.    EMBASSY CONTACTS ALSO REPORTED TWO BOMB </p><p>EXPLOSIONS IN BOGOTA OVER THE WEEKEND, THE FIRST NEAR </p><p>BOGOTA\'S HEAVILY-USED TRANSMILENIO PUBLIC TRANSIT SYSTEM, </p><p>AND THE SECOND AGAINST AN AUTO-REPAIR SHOP USED BY HIGH- </p><p>LEVEL POLICE OFFICERS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) ON MARCH 24, AN EXPLOSION IN SARAVENA (ARAUCA </p><p>DEPARTMENT) CAUSED HEAVY DAMAGE TO THE OFFICES OF THE </p><p>ATTORNEY GENERAL AND THE PROSECUTOR GENERAL.  ALTHOUGH NO </p><p>ONE WAS INJURED, NEARLY A BLOCK OF COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS </p><p>IN DOWNTOWN SARAVENA WAS LEFT IN RUINS.  LOCAL </p><p>AUTHORITIES CONFIRMED THAT THE EXPLOSIVE DEVICE WAS </p><p>PLANTED BY FARC REBELS.  LESS THAN 48 HOURS LATER, ON </p><p>MARCH 27, ANOTHER DEVICE WENT OFF, DESTROYING THE MAYOR\'S </p><p>OFFICE AND THE LOCAL POLICE STATION.  TWO PEOPLE WERE </p><p>INJURED IN THIS SECOND ATTACK.  COLOMBIAN ARMY BOMB </p><p>SQUADS WERE ABLE TO DEFUSE TWO MORE BOMBS THAT SET TO </p><p>EXPLODE IN THE DOWNTOWN AREA. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) MEANWHILE, IN ANOTHER SAD CHAPTER TO THE SAGA OF </p><p>ANDRES FELIPE PEREZ, ON APRIL 5, THE INTERNATIONAL RED </p><p>CROSS RECOVERED THE BODIES OF TWO POLICE OFFICERS, BOTH </p><p>MURDERED BY THE FARC.  ONE OF THE BODIES WAS THAT OF </p><p>CORPORAL JOSE NORBERTO PEREZ, KIDNAPPED BY THE FARC 27 </p><p>MONTHS AGO, FROM RISARALDA DEPARTMENT.  PEREZ WAS THE </p><p>FATHER OF ANDRES FELIPE, A 13-YEAR-OLD BOY WHO DIED OF </p><p>CANCER LAST DECEMBER, AFTER HAVING PLEADED WITH THE FARC </p><p>TO RELEASE HIS FATHER SO THAT THE FAMILY COULD BE </p><p>REUNITED BEFORE THE BOY\'S DEATH.  THE FARC REFUSED TO </p><p>RELEASE PEREZ, CAUSING NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL </p><p>OUTRAGE.  THE SECOND BODY WAS IDENTIFIED AS POLICEMAN </p><p>VICTOR MANUEL RUEDA, KIDNAPPED BY THE FARC FROM ANTIOQUIA </p><p>DEPARTMENT IN AUGUST 1999.  IN A STATEMENT TO THE PRESS, </p><p>THE VICTIMS\' FAMILIES SAID THAT THE TWO MEN HAD BEEN </p><p>BROUGHT FROM THE JUNGLES OF SOUTHERN COLOMBIA TO </p><p>ANTIOQUIA, WHERE THEY WERE SHOT IN THE BACK WHILE </p><p>ATTEMPTING TO ESCAPE. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) ON APRIL 7, 12 PEOPLE, INCLUDING SIX MINORS, WERE </p><p>KILLED AND AS MANY AS 100 OTHERS INJURED BY A FARC </p><p>"BOOBY-TRAP" BOMB DETONATED IN VILLAVICENCIO (META </p><p>DEPARTMENT), SOME 50 MILES FROM BOGOTA.  THE TWO-STAGE </p><p>ATTACK TOOK PLACE IN THE "ZONA ROSA" DISTRICT OF THE </p><p>CITY, KNOWN FOR ITS POPULAR BARS AND NIGHTCLUBS.  AT </p><p>APPROXIMATELY 1:00 A.M., A 20-KILOGRAM DEVICE EXPLODED, </p><p>SHAKING THE NEIGHBORHOOD BUT CAUSING LITTLE INJURY OR </p><p>DAMAGE.  MANY IN THE AREA CAME OUTSIDE TO SEE WHAT HAD </p><p>HAPPENED.  ABOUT TEN MINUTES LATER, AFTER A CROWD HAD </p><p>FORMED, AND AFTER THE ARRIVAL OF THE AUTHORITIES, FARC </p><p>TERRORISTS DETONATED A SECOND DEVICE -- A CAR BOMB LOADED </p><p>WITH 100 KILOGRAMS OF HIGH-POWER EXPLOSIVE.  IN ADDITION </p><p>TO THE DEATHS AND INJURIES, THE BLAST DESTROYED 15 </p><p>VEHICLES, 30 HOUSES, AND THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE "SUPER </p><p>RADIO" BROADCASTING COMPANY.  PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE </p><p>ALVARO URIBE VELEZ HAS CLAIMED THAT "SUPER RADIO" WAS THE </p><p>TARGET OF THE ATTACK, FOR HAVING IGNORED FARC DEMANDS TO </p><p>STOP BROADCASTING HIS CAMPAIGN ANNOUNCEMENTS.  PRESIDENT </p><p>PASTRANA CONDEMNED THE ATTACKS, SAYING THAT THERE WAS NO </p><p>DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TERRORIST BOMBINGS IN ISRAEL AND </p><p>THOSE THAT TAKE PLACE IN COLOMBIA.  PASTRANA REITERATED </p><p>HIS REQUEST TO THE WORLD COMMUNITY TO HELP COLOMBIA </p><p>COMBAT THE TERRORISTS. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) THE APRIL 7 CAR-BOMB IN VILLAVICENCIO WAS THE </p><p>SECOND BOMBING INCIDENT IN THE DEPARTMENT IN TWO DAYS. </p><p>ON APRIL 5, FARC GUERRILLAS DETONATED A BOMB ALONG THE </p><p>VILLAVICENCIO-BOGOTA HIGHWAY, HALTING TRAFFIC FOR TEN </p><p>HOURS.  THE SAME DAY, FARC FORCES DETONATED A CAR BOMB IN </p><p>THE COMMERCIAL DISTRICT OF THE SMALL TOWN OF FUENTE DE </p><p>ORO, DAMAGING FOUR HOMES AND SEVERAL SMALL BUSINESSES. </p><p>POLICE PREVENTED A LARGER TRAGEDY BY ORDERING THE </p><p>EVACUATION OF PEOPLE LIVING IN THE AREA, AFTER DETECTING </p><p>A SECOND CAR HEAVILY LOADED WITH EXPLOSIVES. </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) THE FARC MAY ALSO BE INVOLVED IN THE RECENT MURDER </p><p>OF A PRIEST IN NEIVA (HUILA DEPARTMENT).  ON APRIL 7, TWO </p><p>GUNMEN ENTERED A CHURCH IN NEIVA, AND SHOT AND KILLED </p><p>PRIEST JUAN RAMON NUNEZ, WHILE HE WAS CONDUCTING MASS. </p><p>NUNEZ DIED AT A LOCAL HOSPITAL.  PRESS REPORTS SPECULATED </p><p>THAT HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN TARGETED BECAUSE OF HIS PUBLIC </p><p>DEMAND FOR THE FARC TO RELEASE A LOCAL KIDNAP VICTIM. </p><p>ONE PARISHIONER WAS ALSO WOUNDED IN THE ATTACK.  NUNEZ\'S </p><p>MURDER BRINGS TO 40 THE NUMBER OF PRIESTS MURDERED BY THE </p><p>FARC AND ELN IN THE PAST TEN YEARS. </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) EMBASSY ATF REPORTED TWO BOMB EXPLOSIONS IN </p><p>DOWNTOWN BOGOTA ON APRIL 6.  AT 8:20 P.M., A GRENADE </p><p>EXPLODED AT A STATION OF BOGOTA\'S POPULAR TRANSMILENIO </p><p>PUBLIC TRANSIT SYSTEM.  THE STATION AND THREE BUSES WERE </p><p>DAMAGED.  DIJIN (JUDICIAL AND INVESTIGATIVE POLICE </p><p>DIRECTORATE) CONTACTS ADVISED THAT ALTHOUGH THE ATTACKER </p><p>HAS NOT BEEN IDENTIFIED, FARC OPERATIVES ARE SUSPECTED, </p><p>BASED ON AN ATTACK ON THE SAME STATION BY FARC FORCES </p><p>ROUGHLY SIX WEEKS AGO.  THE SECOND BLAST TOOK PLACE AT </p><p>AROUND 8:30 P.M., AT AN AUTO-REPAIR SHOP USED BY THE </p><p>COLOMBIAN NATIONAL POLICE.  DIJIN SOURCES REPORTED THAT </p><p>THE BOMB MAY HAVE BEEN PLACED BY FARC AGENTS, WHO HAD </p><p>REPORTEDLY BEEN EXTORTING THE SHOP OWNER. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) COMMENT: IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER THE CAR BOMBING IN </p><p>VILLAVICENCIO REPRESENTS THE BEGINNING OF THE FARC\'S </p><p>ANTICIPATED ACTIONS IN ADVANCE OF THE MAY 26 PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>ELECTION.  DURING THE PAST SIX WEEKS, THE COLMIL HAS </p><p>MAINTAINED FAIRLY AGGRESSIVE OPERATIONS AGAINST FARC </p><p>UNITS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.  ALSO, THE AIR FORCE </p><p>CARRIED OUT PREEMPTIVE STRIKES AGAINST FARC MOBILE </p><p>COLUMNS, WHICH PROBABLY HAS COMPLICATED GUERRILLA EFFORTS </p><p>TO LAUNCH THEIR CAMPAIGN.  AT THE SAME TIME, SENIOR </p><p>COLMIL OFFICERS HAVE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THEY ARE </p><p>INCREASINGLY HARD PRESSED TO COVER KEY INFRASTRUCTURE </p><p>TARGETS WHILE CONTINUING TO MAINTAIN OFFENSIVE OPERATIONS </p><p>AGAINST THE GUERRILLAS.  WITH THE ELECTIONS ON THE </p><p>HORIZON, THE COLMIL WILL LIKELY BEGIN TO FOCUS THEIR </p><p>EFFORTS ON A STRATEGY TO PROTECT POLLING PLACES AND </p><p>VOTERS, A TASK THAT THEY FULFILLED WITH REMARKABLE </p><p>SUCCESS FOR THE MARCH 10 CONGRESSIONAL ELECTIONS.  DAO </p><p>CONTACTS HAVE ADVISED THAT POLLING SECURITY EFFORTS WILL </p><p>NOT DETRACT FROM "OPERATION TANATOS," THE COLMIL\'S </p><p>ONGOING EFFORT TO RE-ESTABLISH GOVERNMENT CONTROL IN 19 </p><p>DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>PATTERSON </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
