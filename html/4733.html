<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 008993 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EUR/SE; EUR/PPD; EB </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, AF, PREL, SOCI, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TELLING THE STORY OF AFGHAN RECONSTRUCTION IN </p><p>TURKEY </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) SECSTATE 251091;(B) ANKARA 8699 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Post appreciates message of sustained interest in telling </p><p>the story of US efforts in Afghan reconstruction. Turkey has </p><p>a long historical tie to Afghanistan and is proud of its </p><p>current status as a leader in Afghan reconstruction. Our </p><p>responsibility is to demonstrate to the Turkish populace </p><p>that this is a cooperative effort, that the US is going to </p><p>stick with the program, and that we appreciate the role of </p><p>democratic, secular and Muslim Turkey in the effort. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. Turks have ties of blood and cultural history with many </p><p>of the ethnic groups in Afghanistan. As Turkey modernized </p><p>under progressive Sultans, the Young Turks, and finally </p><p>under Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, there were close relationships </p><p>with reforming elements in Afghanistan. Many Afghans studied </p><p>in Turkey throughout the 20th century. Turkish schools and </p><p>hospitals operated during most of the 23 years of bloodshed </p><p>in Afghanistan.  The survival of a secular state in a Muslim </p><p>Afghanistan is important to the Turkish state. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. Turks are not just observers of Afghan reconstruction. </p><p>They are taking a lead alongside the USA in the effort. They </p><p>follow closely all aspects of recovery: political </p><p>developments, humanitarian needs, security concerns, and </p><p>regional influences.  Turks are the current leaders of the </p><p>International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Kabul - a </p><p>major commitment of troops and resources.  Within days of </p><p>the fall of the Taliban, Turkish cabinet officers and senior </p><p>military leaders were in Kabul.  Turkish NGOs and GOT </p><p>assistance elements have been working to re-establish </p><p>Turkish hospitals and schools throughout the northern </p><p>provinces and in the capital.  The Ataturk Children\'s </p><p>Hospital was up and running during the first days of </p><p>liberation. During the past year Afghan military, police, </p><p>diplomatic and health officials have had training programs </p><p>in Turkish counterpart ministries. The Turkish private </p><p>sector has looked for openings and world-class Turkish </p><p>construction companies are on site, even taking a part in </p><p>the building of USG buildings in Afghanistan. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. What are the primary misconceptions of U.S. objectives in </p><p>Afghanistan?  More than misconceptions, Turks have serious </p><p>concerns about the impact that the pursuing of U.S. </p><p>objectives will lead.  Turks fully recognize that U.S. </p><p>leadership in Afghan reconstruction is a potent catalyst </p><p>necessary to convince other countries and institutions to </p><p>contribute to the effort.  They view generous U.S. financial </p><p>contributions as a powerful and much-appreciated example. </p><p>But . (a) There is Turkish concern is that their generosity </p><p>will be overshadowed by the U.S. (b) Their greatest fear is </p><p>that the US will lose interest, will redirect its energy and </p><p>funds to a war on Iraq, and leave Turkey "holding the bag" </p><p>or simply leave the Afghans to fall back into chaos.  Turks </p><p>cite American "abandonment" of Afghanistan once the Soviets </p><p>were eliminated.  They also note the US failure to "finish </p><p>off" Saddam in 1992 and their much-repeated complaint that </p><p>America drew Turkey into the Gulf War with promises of </p><p>rebuilding a new Iraq only to leave Turkey with 10\'s of </p><p>billions of dollars in lost trade with a sanctioned Iraq. </p><p>Within the Turkish society there are Islamist elements who </p><p>do hold serious misconceptions.  There is a vocal minority </p><p>among them who still believe that our initiatives against al- </p><p>Qaeda and Iraq are really efforts to destroy Islam and to </p><p>grab the oil wealth of Islamic peoples. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. Which reconstruction story would elicit the most positive </p><p>response in Turkey? (a) Any effective message delivered in </p><p>Turkey on Afghan reconstruction must acknowledge Turkey\'s </p><p>longstanding and generous efforts in Afghanistan.  Even </p><p>during a serious financial crisis, the Turks have given </p><p>substantially to help the Afghans. For us to focus on US </p><p>assistance without recognizing Turkish donations of training </p><p>on site and in Turkish universities, food, seed, medicine </p><p>and baby food, without referring to the pioneering effort of </p><p>the Turkish-Afghan business Council and a variety of Turkish </p><p>NGOs would detract from the credibility of any American </p><p>message. We must show that we are doing is in a cooperative </p><p>nature along with the Turks.  For Turkish TV, Betacam-sp </p><p>clips that showed Turks and American working together, then </p><p>going on to things that we are doing by ourselves, would be </p><p>effective. (b) We must also stress the fact that we are NOT </p><p>going to withdraw, but that we are pledged to stay and have </p><p>made investments that mean that we will stay. (Statements by </p><p>senior USG officials, visuals of buildings and investments </p><p>that illustrate a continuing commitment - perhaps American </p><p>moving from trailers into permanent structures) will all </p><p>help.  (c) We had one of Turkey\'s top journalists, one with </p><p>a real interest in Afghanistan (Ferai Tinc of "Hurriyet") </p><p>ready to participate in the recently-cancelled "Afghan Road </p><p>Show" to be led by DEPSECDEF Wolfowitz. If the project is </p><p>revisited with the same leadership, there would be a real </p><p>Turkish interest - we just need to have some recognition </p><p>during the trip for the Turkish reconstruction effort. </p><p>(d) When Operation Enduring Freedom began, there was a long </p><p>delay between the time that food drops to Afghan citizens </p><p>began and footage of those drops became available to post </p><p>and/or Turkish media. Thus the plentiful visuals of our </p><p>bombs falling on Afghans, not our aid reaching them, shaped </p><p>the public image of OEF. Now there is good material </p><p>available on how we are helping the Afghans we need to keep </p><p>up the flow. Betacam-SP quality and Turkish language dubbing </p><p>will greatly increase the likelihood of placement. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
