<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SANAA 000511 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>TERREP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/18/2010 </p><p>TAGS: PTER, ASEC, CASC, YM </p><p>SUBJECT: YEMEN: FOUR HUNT OIL EMPLOYEES SHOT, THREE FATALLY </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMB: EJHULL FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Four Hunt Oil employees working at a Hunt rig in </p><p>Marib were shot by a Yemeni employee shortly before 1215 </p><p>hours local March 18.  Ron Horsch, an American citizen, was </p><p>killed, as was William Seville, a Canadian, and Anam </p><p>Al-Qubati, a Yemeni.  Another Canadian, Mark Edwards, has two </p><p>gunshot wounds, to the abdomen and to the leg, and will </p><p>shortly be transferred to the Yemen-German Hospital in Sanaa. </p><p> The assailant was a Yemeni, Naji Ahmed Al-Kumaym, working at </p><p>the Hunt site, an employee of the Nabors firm.  After </p><p>shooting Horsch, Seville, and Edwards, Al-Kumaym shot himself </p><p>dead. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Karim Abu Hamad of Hunt, our source for the above </p><p>information, indicated that Al-Kumaym, as a Nabors employee, </p><p>was a familiar presence at the Marib site.  He was reportedly </p><p>carrying a concealed handgun which he used as the fatal </p><p>weapon.  Abu Hamad said that Hunt has shut down the rig, </p><p>alerted all employees to hunker down and maintain security; </p><p>Hunt headquarters in Dallas has been informed, as have ROYG </p><p>security officials and President Salih\'s office. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) We are maintaining contact with Hunt.  We are </p><p>offering medical assistance if necessary, and following up </p><p>regarding contacts with next-of-kin and arrangements for Mr. </p><p>Horsch.  We have alerted the Operations Center by phone and </p><p>the Canadian Embassy in Riyadh.  We are initiating contact </p><p>with the Ministry of Interior to launch an immediate </p><p>investigation, including the FBI representative at post, and </p><p>are also in touch through liaison channels with PSO. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Comment: At this initial stage, it is not possible to </p><p>determine if these Hunt shootings were motivated by </p><p>terrorism, by a job-related grievance, or by al-Kumaym\'s </p><p>personal sense of grievance in the heated environment of </p><p>regional developments. </p><p>HULL </p><p></p></div>
