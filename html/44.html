<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L BEIRUT 01668 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, PREL, LE </p><p>SUBJECT:  SYRIAN EXERTS PRESSURE ON LEBANESE </p><p>FORCE DISSIDENTS </p><p> </p><p>REFS:  (A) DAMASCUS 1787, (B) BEIRUT 1653, (C) BEIRUT 164 </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SYRIA CONTINUES TO EXERT POLITICAL AND MILITARY </p><p>PRESSURE AGAINST DISSIDENT ELEMENTS OF THE </p><p>LEBANESE FORCES.  STATEMENTS FROM DAMASCUS BY </p><p>SYRIAN AND LEBANESE LEADERS HINT AT RETALIATION </p><p>IF THE REVOLT CONTINUES.  AFTER MEETING WITH </p><p>PRESIDENT ASSAD, FORMER PRESIDENT SULEIMAN </p><p>FRANJIEH MET ON MARCH 16 WITH MINISTERS BARRI </p><p>AND JUMBLATT IN DAMASCUS.  AFTERWARD, THEY </p><p>ISSUED A STATEMENT INCLUDING A VEILED THREAT: </p><p>"THE ACTION UNDERTAKEN IN CERTAIN REGIONS OF </p><p>LEBANON BY A GROUP WITH SUSPECTED TIES TO </p><p>ISRAEL AND SUPPORTED BY THE UNITED STATES </p><p>THREATENS THE UNITY, PEACE, AND EXISTENCE OF LEBANON </p><p>AND COULD LEAD TO RENEWED CIVIL WAR."  THIS IS </p><p>ONLY THE LATEST IN A SERIES OF MENACING STATEMENTS </p><p>ISSUING FROM THE SYRIAN CAPITAL. </p><p> </p><p>3.  ON THE MILITARY FRONT, THE SITUATION DE- </p><p>SCRIBED  IN REFTEL B CONTINUES.  THERE ARE </p><p>NO INDICATIONS OF ANY INTENTION TO ENGAGE </p><p>LF UNITS AT MADFOUN.  TO THE CONTRARY, L\'ORIENT- </p><p>LE JOUR REPORTS PM KARAMI SAYING PRIVATELY THAT </p><p>SYRIAN FORCES WOULD NOT INTERVENE WITHOUT AN </p><p>OFFICIAL GOL REQUEST. </p><p> </p><p>4.  JA\' JA\' AND HIS DISSIDENTS ARE RESPONDING TO </p><p>THIS SYRIAN INTIMIDATION.  THEY SHOW GREAT </p><p>CONCERN AT SYRIAN TROOP MOVEMENTS (SEPTEL).  IN </p><p>ADDITION, THE CHRISTIAN DECISION MOVEMENT (CDM) </p><p>EMERGENCY COUNCIL STATED ON MARCH 16, FOR THE </p><p>THIRD CONSECUTIVE DAY, ITS AVERSION TO THE USE </p><p>OF FORCE AND ITS PREFERENCE FOR A POLITICAL </p><p>ROLE.  IT ALSO DECLARED ITS WILLINGNESS TO OPEN </p><p>CONTACTS WITH THE SYRIANS AND ALL OTHER CONCERNED </p><p>PARTIES.  COMMAND COUNCIL MEMBER KARIM PAKRADOUNI </p><p>HAS NOW HAD TWO CONVERSATIONS WITH SYRIAN FIRST </p><p>VP KHADDAM IN WHICH HE DENIED ANY CDM TIES TO </p><p>ISRAEL.  THE MOVEMENT SEEMS TO BE MAKING THE </p><p>MAXIMUM EFFORT TO ALLEVIATE SYRIAN CONCERNS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  IN RESPONSE TO PM KARAMI\'S MARCH 15 BLAST AT </p><p>THE DISSIDENTS (SEPTEL), THE JA\'JA\' FORCES </p><p>HAVE PROPOSED THE FORMATION OF A CHRISTIAN NATIONAL </p><p>COUNCIL TO SERVE AS A FORUM FOR UNIQUELY CHRISTIAN </p><p>VOICES.  THIS IS AN IDEA  WHICH HAS BEEN DUSTED </p><p>OFF AT INTERVALS SINCE 1981.  ONLY TIME WILL </p><p>TELL IF IT IS ONCE AGAIN A NON-STARTER. </p><p> </p><p>6.  THE SITUATION ON THE GROUND REMAINS TENSE BUT </p><p>QUIET.  TRAFFIC CONTINUES UNIMPEDED ALONG THE </p><p>COASTAL HIGHWAY FROM BEIRUT AS FAR NORTH AS </p><p>MADFOUN.  AT MADFOUN, HOWEVER, WHILE NORTH- </p><p>BOUND TRAFFIC IS PERMITTED THROUGH, TRAFFIC </p><p>FROM TRIPOLI SOUTH TOWARD BEIRUT IS HALTED AND </p><p>TURNED BACK. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BARTHOLOMEW </p><p></p></div>
