<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 AMMAN 006515 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>TREASURY MILLS/PIPATANAGUL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/04/2007 </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, EAID, PREL, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDAN IMF TEAM REVIEWS IRAQ SCENARIOS </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: ECON COUNSELOR TOM GOLDBERGER REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>------ </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) According to an IMF team visiting Amman this week to </p><p>discuss the Fund\'s program for 2003, economic disruptions </p><p>from military operations against Iraq could increase Jordan\'s </p><p>external financing need by $1.2 billion in 2003.  Substantial </p><p>external assistance could over time, however, help smooth the </p><p>economy\'s adjustment to higher oil prices.  The Fund is </p><p>generally pleased with Jordan\'s economic growth and progress </p><p>on economic reform and privatization, but needs to see </p><p>speedier movement on pension reform before it can commit to </p><p>post-2003 funding.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>PROGRAM AND CONTINGENCIES </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) At their request, IMF team members Joannes </p><p>Mongardini, Economist--Middle East Department, Ashok Bhatia, </p><p>Economist-Treasurer\'s Department, and Todd Schneider, </p><p>Policies Department, briefed the Economic Section and USAID </p><p>at the Embassy November 4.  The mission is in Amman for two </p><p>weeks to review Jordan\'s performance under stand-by </p><p>arrangements and to discuss the Fund\'s program in Jordan for </p><p>2003.  In so doing, they are looking closely at the impact on </p><p>the balance of payments and the budget of possible military </p><p>operations against Iraq.  The mission\'s findings will be </p><p>discussed by the IMF Board in March. </p><p> </p><p>---- </p><p>IRAQ </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Mongardini said the potential consequences of </p><p>military action in Iraq could be severe.  He said the loss of </p><p>the oil grant/subsidy from Iraq, the disruption of trade, </p><p>temporary capital flight due to political uncertainty, and a </p><p>reduction in GDP growth might mean a $1.2 billion increase in </p><p>the Jordanian economy\'s external financing need for next year </p><p>over and above the baseline.  Mongardini allowed that the </p><p>Central Bank of Jordan (CBJ) could use reserves to partially </p><p>cover this, but that would only plug half the gap.  To avoid </p><p>a brutal economic shock, the rest, he said, would have to be </p><p>made up in additional support by donors and international </p><p>financial institutions. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) The team said that the key issue was smoothing the </p><p>adjustment of petroleum product prices to market levels. </p><p>Along those lines, Mongardini said, the team had just met </p><p>with Jordanian Minister of Finance Michel Marto, who was </p><p>"very happy" over recent discussions in Washington regarding </p><p>USG intentions to assist Jordan, but did not provide any </p><p>details.  But regardless of the source of external financing, </p><p>the economy would need time to adjust to petroleum prices </p><p>that would be 50-60% higher than current prices, as well as </p><p>the loss of budget revenue due to the loss of the "oil </p><p>surplus".  Mongardini estimated that a smooth adjustment </p><p>would entail increasing prices to market levels over a two to </p><p>three year period. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Mongardini also said the Fund was going to advise </p><p>the Ministry of Finance to increase general sales and excise </p><p>taxes on petroleum products to end the budget\'s dependence on </p><p>the oil surplus.  This would give the government flexibility </p><p>to subsidize, for example, lower kerosene prices for the poor </p><p>by raising taxes on other petroleum products. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>OTHERWISE, THE NEWS IS GOOD </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) Mongardini said that, Iraq aside, "things looked </p><p>good".  The government was well on track to attain its target </p><p>of 5% GDP growth for the year, with preliminary Ministry of </p><p>Finance figures showing 5.3% growth for the third quarter </p><p>thanks to an impressive 11% increase in tourism receipts and </p><p>strong exports, up 77% over last year to the U.S. alone. </p><p>Mongardini said that although domestic demand seemed to be </p><p>weak and domestic revenues a bit below target, the government </p><p>was on track for deficit reduction, as it is holding back on </p><p>capital expenditures and other spending. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) In a related issue, the team said the Fund was </p><p>hopeful that the government would merge the Program for </p><p>Social and Economic Transformation (PSET), an off-budget plan </p><p>to fund various economic development projects via grants and </p><p>privatization proceeds, into the regular budget next year. </p><p>Mongardini said the danger is that the PSET would take on a </p><p>"life of its own".  He said the Fund is encouraging the </p><p>government to base project spending on secured finance, but </p><p>that Marto does not quite understand how integrating the PSET </p><p>into the budget would work at this point.  Mongardini said </p><p>the IMF proposed that "the funding the government could count </p><p>on" should be in the budget, and that the government could </p><p>still have a "wish list" of proposed projects should </p><p>additional funds become available.  He emphasized that the </p><p>Fund needed assurances from Jordan that this integration </p><p>would happen. </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>PENSION REFORM </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Mongardini told us that some progress had been made </p><p>in pension reform.  He said that King Abdullah signed a </p><p>decree October 10 increasing the retirement age by six months </p><p>per year for the next ten years.  The enrollment of new </p><p>military recruits in the government\'s military pension plan </p><p>has not yet been frozen, but a plan to enroll recruits in the </p><p>Social Security Corporation is currently under active </p><p>discussion and could be implemented by year\'s end, according </p><p>to Mongardini. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) The team said the more difficult issue is the </p><p>disability pension for retirees in the military system. </p><p>Currently, 85% of military retirees get both a regular </p><p>pension and disability.  Mongardini said a Fund-endorsed plan </p><p>was on the table that would move disability certification </p><p>from the military to an independent board of doctors under </p><p>the direction of the ministry of Health.  The plan is closely </p><p>held, however, as the military is concerned that personnel </p><p>might retire now to take advantage of current regulations. </p><p>Action in Iraq, he added, would "stop everything".  But he </p><p>said the IMF "will use all the leverage it has" regarding the </p><p>pension issues, and will not go ahead with post-2003 funding </p><p>unless both plans are met. </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>PRIVATIZATION </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU) Bhatia said that privatization plans for next year </p><p>appear to be headed in the right direction.  He said the </p><p>unbundling of the electricity sector had been finished.  The </p><p>government planned to sell the generation and distribution </p><p>companies next year, and expected "a substantial amount" of </p><p>privatization proceeds as a result.  As the government wants </p><p>to retain the power grid in state hands, the transmission </p><p>company will not be offered.  Bhatia said the government has </p><p>shortlisted six potential bidders for the Arab Potash </p><p>Company, with bids due at the end of January 2003 and the </p><p>final sale to take place in March 2003.  Talks regarding the </p><p>sale of Jordanian Phosphate Mines Company to the Potash </p><p>Company of Saskatchewan were in "the third round", according </p><p>to Bhatia.  But, he added, the government was also </p><p>considering restructuring the company over the next 12-14 </p><p>months should negotiations stall.  Bhatia claimed there was </p><p>also some hope the sale of Royal Jordanian Airlines could </p><p>move forward next year.  All told, Bhatia said privatization </p><p>receipts next year could go as high as $560 million. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>JORDAN TELECOM IPO </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>11.  (SBU) The Team said the Fund was "quite pleased" that so </p><p>many investors bought shares in Jordan Telecom (JTC), as it </p><p>opens doors for IPOs in the future.  Marto told the team he </p><p>was also pleased with the offering, and predicted a closing </p><p>price of JD 2.5 ($3.50) per share after yesterday\'s first day </p><p>of public trading on the Amman Stock Exchange.  (Note: JTC </p><p>closed at JD2.45.)  Bhatia called the decision by the Social </p><p>Security Corporation (SSC) to purchase 5% "very gutsy", but </p><p>said with its currently high level of liquidity, the SSC </p><p>could well afford the move.  Bhatia said the government was </p><p>likely to offer another 10-15% of JTC for sale next year. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  (SBU) Regarding technical assistance, the Fund is </p><p>sending a tax advisor to the Ministry of Finance (MOF), </p><p>arriving the weekend of November 7, to advise the Jordanian </p><p>government on setting up a new income tax system, one that </p><p>would represent what Mongardini called a "clean slate".  The </p><p>advisor will be resident at the Ministry for at least one </p><p>year.  In addition, the Fund will provide assistance to the </p><p>Ministry on a treasury accounting system. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (SBU) Most importantly, the MOF has agreed to accept a </p><p>Financial Sector Assessment Program Mission in March and May </p><p>of 2003.  Jointly run by the IMF and the World Bank, the </p><p>assessment will comprehensively examine the sector for </p><p>soundness and vulnerabilities.  The total report will remain </p><p>strictly confidential, but the substance will make up part of </p><p>the Fund\'s Article IV consultations regarding Jordan in </p><p>November, 2003. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  (SBU)  The Fund is generally pleased with Jordan\'s </p><p>economic performance.  That said, it is also clear that </p><p>momentum in pension reform and privatizations is imperative </p><p>for the government to retain the IMF\'s continued support.  We </p><p>expect that forward progress will continue, but action in </p><p>Iraq could well at least temporarily derail Jordan\'s economic </p><p>growth and progress on reform. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
