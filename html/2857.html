<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001070 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>AF/PD FOR COX AND ROBERTSON, AF/S FOR KRAFT AND </p><p>SCHLACHTER, AF/RA FOR DIPALMA, INR/R/MR, NSC FOR </p><p>JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ZI, PREL, PHUM </p><p>SUBJECT: REPORTERS RELEASED FROM POLICE CUSTODY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.   Two independent "Daily News" reporters, Lloyd </p><p>    Mudiwa and Collin Chiwanza, and a correspondent for the </p><p>    British "Guardian" newspaper, American citizen Andrew </p><p>    Meldrum, were released from police custody on May 2 </p><p>    after they were formally charged under a section of the </p><p>    newly enacted Access to Information and Protection of </p><p>    Privacy Act.  The charges stem from the journalists\' </p><p>    publication of a story, since discredited, that ZANU-PF </p><p>    supporters had beheaded a 53-year-old woman. </p><p> </p><p>2.   If found guilty of the charges, each of the three </p><p>    reporters faces a maximum fine of 100,000 Zimbabwe </p><p>    dollars (about 1800 US dollars at the official exchange </p><p>    rate) or up to two years imprisonment.  The three are </p><p>    expected to appear in court again on May 3.  Lawyers </p><p>    for the journalists will argue that the case should be </p><p>    dismissed because the law under which they were charged </p><p>    is unconstitutional.  The case is likely to work its </p><p>    way slowly through Zimbabwe\'s court system. </p><p> </p><p>3.   A May 2 news release from the Zimbabwe chapter of </p><p>    the Media Institute of Southern Africa (MISA), </p><p>    condemned the detention of the three journalists, </p><p>    saying "the suffering, humiliation and intimidation </p><p>    they had experienced far outweighed the offense they </p><p>    were alleged to have committed."  Information Minister </p><p>    Jonathan Moyo said that the three were not journalists </p><p>    but "common criminals," and hailed their arrest as </p><p>    proof that Zimbabwe respects the rule of law. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
