<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 001745 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/12/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, IZ, AL, XF, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: FONMIN MUASHER WILL NOT ATTEND MARCH 24 CAIRO ARAB </p><p>LEAGUE MINISTERIAL </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 75616 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: A/DCM Doug Silliman for reasons 1.5 (B)(D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  Ambassador spoke with Foreign Minister Marwan </p><p>Muasher March 23 to deliver ref points on the planned March </p><p>24 Arab League ministerial meeting in Cairo.  The Ambassador </p><p>asked that Jordan work to avoid statements or actions that </p><p>would undermine current efforts to disarm the Iraqi regime </p><p>and liberate the Iraqi people, and to help the meeting focus </p><p>on support for a new Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  Muasher responded that he was sure the ministerial </p><p>would be "a bad meeting," especially "with Libya in the </p><p>chair."  Consequently, he did not want to be associated with </p><p>it and would not attend.  He said he did not expect "the Gulf </p><p>Foreign Ministers" to attend.  Muasher said Jordan\'s </p><p>Ambassador in Cairo will represent Jordan, and that he has </p><p>instructions to avoid language that will undermine coalition </p><p>efforts, and to encourage discussion of the future of Iraq. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
