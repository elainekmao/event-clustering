CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  DEPUTY PM KOSTOVIC TOLD VISITING DRL A/S SHATTUCK THAT </p><p>THE CROATIAN GOVERNMENT HAS DECIDED TO REPATRIATE THE </p><p>20,000 ABDIC REBEL MUSLIMS IN THE KUPLJENSKO CAMP NEAR </p><p>VOJNIC AFTER 10-15 DAYS IF NO AGREEMENT IS REACHED IN THE </p><p>INTERIM FOR THEIR RETURN.  CROATIA, BOSNIA, AND TURKEY </p><p>WOULD PROVIDE AN INTERNATIONAL POLICE FORCE TO PROVIDE FOR </p><p>THEIR SAFETY.  KOSTOVIC REQUESTED USG ASSISTANCE TO </p><p>PRESSURE THE GOBH TO PROVIDE GUARANTEES FOR THEIR SAFE </p><p>RETURN.  HE CLAIMED THAT THE REVOCATION OF REFUGEE STATUS </p><p>DECREE FOR BOSNIANS FROM THE FEDERATION AND THE NEWLY </p><p>LIBERATED TERRITORIES WOULD NOT FORCIBLY REPATRIATE THEM, </p><p>BUT "ONLY" CUT OFF THEIR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE.  HOWEVER, </p><p>HE ADDED THAT WHILE ETHNIC CROAT DUAL NATIONALS WOULD BE </p><p>LEGALLY ALLOWED TO STAY, OTHERS (MUSLIMS FROM B-H) WOULD </p><p>NOT BE PERMITTED TO REMAIN.  KOSTOVIC AGREED TO WORK WITH </p><p>GRANIC TO SET UP A NEW PROCEDURE IN THE BELGRADE MISSION </p><p>OF THE GOC FOR SERBS TO APPLY TO RETURN.  END SUMMARY. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  03839  01 OF 03  022002Z </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>ABDIC REFUGEES </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER DR. IVICA KOSTOVIC, WHO IS </p><p>RESPONSIBLE FOR THE REINTEGRATED TERRITORIES, TOLD DRL A/S </p><p>JOHN SHATTUCK ON SEPTEMBER 30 THAT, AT A NATIONAL SECURITY </p><p>COUNCIL MEETING EARLIER THAT MORNING, THE GOC HAD MADE THE </p><p>POLITICAL DECISION TO REPATRIATE THE 20,000 ABDIC MUSLIMS </p><p>AT THE KUPLJENSKO CAMP WITHIN THE NEXT 10-15 DAYS.  (NOTE: </p><p>THESE PEOPLE HAVE NOT BEEN GIVEN REFUGEE STATUS BY THE GOC </p><p>BECAUSE IT BELIEVES THAT VELIKA KLADUSA IS A SAFE PLACE TO </p><p>RETURN.  END NOTE.)  WINTERIZING THE CAMP WAS NOT AN </p><p>OPTION THE GOC WOULD CONSIDER.  THE GOC HAD AGREED TO A </p><p>TRIPARTITE TURKISH, BOSNIAN, AND CROATIAN POLICE FORCE AND </p><p>A TURKISH OMBUDSMAN TO MONITOR THE SECURITY OF THE TOWN. </p><p>THE GOC ALREADY HAD THE LEGAL AUTHORITY TO REMOVE THE </p><p>ARMED MEN IN THE CAMP AND WOULD SOON DO SO.  KOSTOVIC </p><p>CLAIMED THAT ALL BUT 400-1200 OF THE REFUGEES WOULD </p><p>RETURN IF THE GOBH WERE TO ISSUE AN AMNESTY AND PROVIDE </p><p>FOR THEIR RETURN.  (COMMENT:  THIS VIEW WAS SHARED BY </p><p>SOME, BUT NOT ALL, UNHCR OFFICIALS AT KUPLJENSKO, DURING </p><p>A/S SHATTUCK\'S VISIT THERE SEPTEMBER 29.  THE REFUGEES </p><p>THEMSELVES, HOWEVER, CONTENDED AN AMNESTY ALONE WOULD BE </p><p>INSUFFICIENT, UNTIL THE WAR IN BOSNIA WAS OVER.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  A/S SHATTUCK EMPHASIZED THAT THIS DECISION POSED </p><p>SERIOUS CONCERNS FOR THE USG AND COULD DEVELOP INTO AN </p><p>EXPLOSIVE SITUATION.  HE URGED THE GOC TO RECONSIDER ANY </p><p>FORCED REPATRIATION AND TO WORK WITH THE GOBH TO PROVIDE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  03839  01 OF 03  022002Z </p><p>GUARANTEES FOR THEIR RETURN.  KOSTOVIC RESPONDED THAT </p><p>CROATIA HAD A STRATEGIC INTEREST IN ENSURING THE </p><p>ESTABLISHMENT OF A NON-FUNDAMENTALIST, PEACEFUL ENTITY AT </p><p>ITS BORDER.  THE GOC HAD ACCEPTED REQUESTS FROM SOME OF </p><p>THE SOLDIERS TO JOIN THE HVO AS A WAY TO PROMOTE THEIR </p><p>REINTEGRATION. </p><p> </p><p>5.  KOSTOVIC TOOK THE ASSISTANT SECRETARY\'S POINT AND WAS </p><p>CONCERNED ABOUT AVOIDING A HUMAN CATASTROPHE.  "I WAS </p><p>AGAINST USING FORCE.  OTHER MINISTERS FELT DIFFERENTLY." </p><p>KOSTOVIC PROMISED TO RAISE THE ISSUE WITH PRESIDENT </p><p>TUDJMAN AND DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER MISETIC AND WARN THEM OF </p><p>ITS POTENTIAL DANGERS.  "WE HAVEN\'T HAD GOOD COOPERATION </p><p>WITH THE BOSNIAN GOVERNMENT" ON THIS ISSUE.  HE REQUESTED </p><p>USG ASSISTANCE TO PRESSURE THE GOBH TO SOON PROVIDE NEW, </p><p>WRITTEN GUARANTEES FOR THE SAFE RE </p><p>TURN OF THESE PEOPLE. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>REVOCATION OF STATUS DECREE </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.

NO ONE WOULD BE FORCIBLY </p><p>REPATRIATED, HE INSISTED.  THE DIRECTIVE WOULD STOP ALL </p><p>REFUGEE SUPPORT PAYMENTS (DM 7/DAY/PERSON FOR </p><p>ACCOMMODATION), AND PROVIDE AN INCENTIVE FOR THEM TO </p><p>RETURN HOME.  THE GOC WOULD NOT STOP UNHCR AND OTHER </p><p>AGENCIES FROM PROVIDING CONTINUING SUPPORT.  HE SAID </p><p>"MOST" MOST OF THE BOSNIAN REFUGEES IN CROATIA WERE ETHNIC </p><p>CROATS, AND HAD EVERY RIGHT TO MOVE ACROSS THE BORDER </p><p>FREELY.  (COMMENT:  IN FACT, ONLY ABOUT 55 PERCENT ARE.) </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT COULD NOT FORCE THEM TO MOVE ANYWHERE.  AS </p><p>CITIZENS, THIS GROUP WOULD LOSE NEITHER ITS HEALTH </p><p>INSURANCE NOR ITS EDUCATION BENEFITS.  HOWEVER, OF THE </p><p>40,000 MUSLIM REFUGEES IN CROATIA, THOSE FROM FEDERATION </p><p>AND LIBERATED TERRITORIES WOULD INDEED LOSE THEIR RIGHT TO </p><p>STAY. </p><p> </p><p>7.  OPERATION MAESTRAL (LIBERATION OF WESTERN BOSNIA) WAS </p><p>DESIGNED TO PROVIDE "LIVING ROOM" FOR MUSLIMS AND SPACE </p><p>FOR THE FEDERATION, KOSTOVIC SAID.  THE GOC HAD CONCLUDED </p><p>AN AGREEMENT WITH THE GOBH FOR THE RETURN OF PEOPLE, AND </p><p>THE GOBH DID NOT OBJECT TO ACCEPTING ITS PEOPLE.  GERMANY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  03839  02 OF 03  022002Z </p><p>WAS RETURNING REFUGEES TO CROATIA UNDER A SIMILAR </p><p>BILATERAL AGREEMENT.  WITHIN THE NEXT MONTH, THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT WOULD RECONSIDER THE LIST OF PLACES MARKED SAFE </p><p>FOR RETURN AND WOULD CARRY OUT THE DIRECTIVE ON A "STEP- </p><p>BY-STEP" BASIS.  KOSTOVIC ASSERTED THAT CROATIA UNDERSTOOD </p><p>ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW AND WOULD ADHERE </p><p>TO THEM.  HE OPINED THAT JAJCE AND GLAMOC WERE PROBABLY </p><p>SAFE ENOUGH TO RETURN TO UNDER THIS DECREE.  HOWEVER, </p><p>GRAHOVO WAS DESTROYED AND HAD NO INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT </p><p>RETURNING REFUGEES. </p><p> </p><p>8.  A/S SHATTUCK UNDERSCORED THE IMPORTANCE OF KEEPING </p><p>OPEN THE OPTION OF THIRD COUNTRY RESETTLEMENT, AND OF </p><p>BUILDING MORE FACILITIES WITH INTERNATIONAL CONTRIBUTIONS </p><p>TO HOUSE REFUGEES RATHER THAN RETURN PEOPLE TO FRONT-LINE </p><p>AREAS.  KOSTOVIC ANSWERED THAT NO THIRD COUNTRY HAD </p><p>OFFERED TO ACCEPT PERMANENT REFUGEES FROM CROATIA OR </p><p>SERBIA, ONLY BOSNIA.  BOTH SWEDEN AND DENMARK WERE </p><p>RETURNING CROAT REFUGEES, AND THE SHEER NUMBERS OF THOSE </p><p>RETURNING FROM GERMANY HAD PLACED SEVERE FINANCIAL AND </p><p>OTHER DIFFICULTIES ON CROATIA.  JAPAN AND OTHER COUNTRIES </p><p>HAD OFFERED TO BUILD MORE SHELTERS, BUT THE GOVERNMENT HAD </p><p>DECIDED TO INTEGRATE DPS AND REFUGEES INTO SOCIETY AS MUCH </p><p>AS POSSIBLE AND WOULD BUILD NO MORE BARRACKS OR TENT </p><p>CITIES.  "WE DON\'T NEED SHELTERS, WE NEED CASH," KOSTOVIC </p><p>DECLARED.  HE CLAIMED THAT CROATIA HAD RECEIVED NO </p><p>INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL HELP FOR THIS PURPOSE SINCE 1992. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>RIGHT OF RETURN AND CITIZENSHIP ISSUES </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  03839  02 OF 03  022002Z </p><p> </p><p>9.  SHATTUCK INSISTED THAT CROATIA MUST ALLOW FOR THE </p><p>RETURN OF ITS SERBIAN RESIDENTS.  INTERNATIONAL </p><p>PERCEPTIONS ABOUT THE COMMITMENT OF CROATIA TO A MULTI- </p><p>ETHNIC SOCIETY WOULD TURN ON THE RETURN OF CROATIAN SERBS. </p><p>SUCH A RETURN HAD TWO IMPEDIMENTS: THE GENERAL ATMOSPHERE </p><p>OF HOSTILITY IN THE KRAJINA AND THE CONFISCATION OF SERB </p><p>PROPERTY WITHOUT COMPENSATION. </p><p> </p><p>10.  KOSTOVIC ACKNOWLEDGED THESE IMPEDIMENTS, BUT SAID THE </p><p>SECOND COULD NOT BE CHANGED.  UNTIL THE PARLIAMENT WAS </p><p>ELECTED AT THE END OF THE MONTH, IT WAS LEGALLY IMPOSSIBLE </p><p>TO CHANGE THE PROPERTY LAW.  HOWEVER, THERE WAS NO WISH </p><p>AMONG THE SERBS TO RETURN.  MANY HAD LEFT WESTERN SLAVONIA </p><p>LONG AFTER THE MILITARY ACTION HAD ENDED.  SINCE THEN, "I </p><p>SIGNED THE RETURN ORDER FOR 120 WEST SLAVONIAN SERBS, AND </p><p>NONE ARRIVED.  THIS WAS JUST A TEST CASE."  ODPR HAD </p><p>APPROVED DOCUMENTATION FOR 600 SERBS TO RETURN AND NONE </p><p>HAD DONE SO EITHER.  MAYBE SERBS DID NOT WANT TO RETURN </p><p>BECAUSE THE GOC AMNESTY TERMINATED ON MAY 10, 1995, HE </p><p>SUGGESTED.  MEN WHO RETURNED FROM THE KRAJINA WERE SUBJECT </p><p>TO ARREST FOR ARMED REBELLION AND PARAMILITARY ACTIVITIES. </p><p>ACCORDING TO GOC LAW, MEMBERSHIP IN THE "ARSK" AFTER THE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NNNNPTQ2226 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ2226 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  03839  03 OF 03  022003Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-01 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   AMAD-01  CIAE-00  SMEC-00  OASY-00  ANHR-01 </p><p>      SRPP-00  EB-01    OIGO-01  FBIE-00  H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00 </p><p>      IO-02    L-01     ADS-00   M-00     NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01 </p><p>      PA-01    PM-00    PRS-01   P-00     SP-00    SSO-00   SS-00 </p><p>      STR-01   TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00  PMB-00   PRM-10   PRME-01 </p><p>      PRMC-01  DRL-09   G-00       /036W </p><p>                  ------------------F2856A  022003Z /38 </p><p>O 022002Z OCT 95 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 7459 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY WARSAW PRIORITY </p><p>USLO SKOPJE </p><p>DIA WASHDC </p><p>JOINT STAFF WASHDC//J-5PMA/J21// </p><p>AMEMBASSY LJUBLJANA </p><p>NATO EU COLLECTIVE </p><p>AMEMBASSY BELGRADE </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA </p><p>SECDEF WASHDC//ISA/ISP// </p><p>NSC WASHDC </p><p>AMEMBASSY SARAJEVO </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 ZAGREB 003839 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>WARSAW ALSO FOR A/S SHATTUCK </p><p>BRUSSELS ALSO FOR USEU </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  03839  03 OF 03  022003Z </p><p>USVIENNA ALSO FOR USDEL CSCE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: 9/30/00 </p><p>TAGS:  PHUM PREF PGOV PINR BK HR </p><p>SUBJECT:  DEPUTY PM TELLS A/S SHATTUCK GOC PLANS TO </p><p>          REPATRIATE ABDIC MUSLIMS, WILL CUT OFF </p><p>          ASSISTANCE TO BOSNIAN REFUGEES </p><p> </p><p>AMNESTY WAS ENOUGH TO BE ARRESTED.  SHATTUCK EMPHASIZED </p><p>THE IMPORTANCE OF REVISITING THESE LAWS, AND EXTENDING THE </p><p>AMNESTY. </p><p> </p><p>11.  KOSTOVIC EXPLAINED THAT THE SERBS WHO FLED WERE A </p><p>POPULATION OF POTENTIAL CROATIAN CITIZENS, BUT WERE NOT </p><p>LEGAL CITIZENS UNTIL THEY APPLIED FOR AND RECEIVED </p><p>CITIZENSHIP PAPERS, AS HAD ALL OTHER CROATIANS SINCE 1991. </p><p>HE ADMITTED THAT THE CURRENT CATCH-22 APPLICATION PROCESS </p><p>IN BELGRADE WAS INADEQUATE AND PRECLUDED A MASS RETURN. </p><p>ANOTHER PROCEDURE NEEDED TO BE IMPLEMENTED.  HOWEVER, </p><p>SERBIA WOULD NOT ALLOW THESE PEOPLE OUT, DESPITE ITS VOCAL </p><p>CLAIMS TO THE CONTRARY.  KOSTOVIC SAID HE WOULD ASK FOR </p><p>ANOTHER COORDINATION MEETING WITH GRANIC TO SET UP A </p><p>PROCEDURE IN THE BELGRADE GOC OFFICE FOR SERBS TO APPLY TO </p><p>RETURN. </p><p> </p><p>12.  KOSTOVIC SAID HE COOPERATED WELL WITH THE ICRC AND </p><p>OTHER AGENCIES ON THE ISSUE OF DESTRUCTION OF PROPERTY AND </p><p>VIOLENCE COMMITTED AGAINST SERBS.  "WE MUST PROSECUTE THE </p><p>PERPETRATORS OF THESE CRIMES," HE INSISTED.  HE RECOGNIZED </p><p>THAT ALTHOUGH THE GOC CONDEMNED THESE ACTIONS, IT NEEDED </p><p>TO DO MORE IN THE FIELD TO REPUDIATE ANY INSINUATION THAT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  03839  03 OF 03  022003Z </p><p>IT CONDONED THEM. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>MISSING PERSONS </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>13.
