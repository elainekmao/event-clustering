<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 KATHMANDU 000978 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>AID/W FOR DCHA for RWinter, WJGarvelink, DCHA/OFDA </p><p>for TH-Sanchez, MMarx, RThayer, DCHA/OTI for </p><p>GGottlieb, and NSC for JDworken </p><p>ANE/DA/GWEST ANE/SPOTS RCOHN </p><p>MANILA FOR TOM BRENNAN AND MARIZA ROGERS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p> </p><p>TAGS: OFDP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: MAOIST INSURGENCY IN NEPAL (SITREP ONE) </p><p> </p><p>REFS:  (A) STATE 69408, (B) KATHMANDU 515, AND (C) KATHMANDU </p><p>00703 </p><p> </p><p>1. This is a reporting cable only. </p><p> </p><p>2. Summary: </p><p>A) This cable reports briefly on: significant </p><p>events/trends of the Maoist insurgency; current </p><p>status of activities related to the disaster </p><p>declaration, and Mission activities in response to </p><p>the insurgency. </p><p> </p><p>B) This cable contains no recommendations for </p><p>immediate action.  These will be forthcoming from </p><p>the Mission as further information on the </p><p>humanitarian situation is developed. </p><p>C) Recent aggression of the Maoists toward the </p><p>Nepal Red Cross underscores the need for USG </p><p>humanitarian assistance to be provided in such a </p><p>way that the neutrality of NGOs working in Maoist </p><p>areas is not compromised, rendering them </p><p>ineffective. </p><p> </p><p>D) Mission is fully engaged in addressing the </p><p>issues of conflict in Nepal through its recently </p><p>approved SPO and will confer with ANE in regard to </p><p>the need for additional resources and expert </p><p>advice. </p><p> </p><p>3. Events: </p><p>A) Royal Nepal Army\'s success in attacking a </p><p>Maoist training camp in Lisne VDC in Rolpa where </p><p>they claimed to have killed 548 Maoists was </p><p>quickly followed on May 7 by losses to the Maoists </p><p>in Gam VDC where a combined Army and Police </p><p>outpost was overrun.  There were 123 security </p><p>personnel (53 RNA, 40 regular police, and 30 Armed </p><p>Police) at the post.  After the attack, 35 burned </p><p>and unidentifiable bodies were found. Twelve </p><p>wounded RNA, one policeman, and five Armed Police </p><p>have bee evacuated to hospitals, and five other </p><p>RNA and sex regular police survived the attack. </p><p>All others are unaccounted for. No villagers have </p><p>been found and whether they were killed, abducted </p><p>or fled is unknown. </p><p> </p><p>B) Suspected Maoist insurgents set fire to a </p><p>Pepsi-Cola truck making deliveries in Dolakha </p><p>District on May 7.  According to Rajiv Sant, </p><p>Managing Director for the Indian-owned Pepsi </p><p>franchise in Nepal, three gunmen stopped the truck </p><p>and ordered the driver, salesman and distributor </p><p>to get out.  After robbing them, Sant said the </p><p>gunmen told the three Pepsi employees that we </p><p>don\'t want American companies here."  One of the </p><p>gunmen then reportedly blew a whistle, at which </p><p>point a number of young men emerged from the </p><p>surrounding forest.  The group then drove the </p><p>truck off, leaving the three Pepsi employees to </p><p>walk to the next town.  The three gunmen </p><p>meanwhile, calmly walked off into the jungle, </p><p>according to Sant. </p><p> </p><p>C) Coincident with Prime Minister Deuba\'s visit to </p><p>Washington and London the Maoist proposed a </p><p>unilateral one month cease fire.  Deuba citing </p><p>deceit on earlier occasions, rejected the overture </p><p>by the Maoists.  Maoist sources quickly claimed </p><p>that the cease-fire proposal was a fake and not </p><p>penned by the movement.  This was widely </p><p>interpreted as a face saving gesture by the </p><p>Maoists. </p><p> </p><p>D) The previously declared state of emergency, due </p><p>to expire on May 24, may be extended despite some </p><p>opposition in parliament. The King has called a </p><p>special session of Parliament May 23 to debate </p><p>extension of the emergency. </p><p> </p><p>E) On May 12 in Rolpa, Maoists abducted district, </p><p>Narayan Prasad Subedi, a local teacher and member </p><p>of the Red Cross.  He was General Secretary of the </p><p>Red Cross in Rolpa district and President of the </p><p>teachers\' association there. </p><p> </p><p>Trends: </p><p>F) In addition to government officials and </p><p>opposition political cadres who had been the </p><p>traditional targets of the Maoists, teachers and </p><p>other figures of authority in rural areas are </p><p>increa </p><p>singly singled out for attack.  Other more </p><p>recent trends are attacks on infrastructure such </p><p>as telecommunications and water schemes, the use </p><p>of torture (some of which has been in front of </p><p>victims\' families), and the use of human shields </p><p>in attacks on GON military and police positions. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>G) It is unclear whether the abduction mentioned </p><p>in (E) under paragraph (3) was because Mr. Subedi </p><p>was a teacher or because of his position in the </p><p>Red Cross. However, the event along with the </p><p>attack on the Pepsi-Cola truck underscores the </p><p>need for ensuring that USG humanitarian aid be </p><p>provided in such a way that recipient </p><p>organizations do not become targets of the </p><p>Maoists. </p><p> </p><p>4) Disaster Declaration: </p><p>A) The Nepal Red Cross is in the process of </p><p>replenishing emergency stores used in previous </p><p>responses to people affected by the Maoist </p><p>insurgency.  At the completion of this task the </p><p>Mission will reimburse up to $50,000 of this </p><p>expense. </p><p> </p><p>B) The assessment being carried out by the Red </p><p>Cross and promised to the Mission is being </p><p>hampered by Maoist attacks on telecommunications </p><p>that have made it all but impossible to </p><p>consolidate information from individual districts </p><p>into a coherent assessment of the overall </p><p>situation.  ICRC is currently assisting Nepal Red </p><p>Cross in the development of a functional </p><p>communications system but this will take some </p><p>time.  Meanwhile the Mission has gained approval </p><p>from the Ambassador to fund an assessment of IDPs </p><p>in Nepal and is rapidly moving forward to </p><p>implement it using the services of an </p><p>international expert with ICRC experience. </p><p>Mission will keep Washington appraised. In </p><p>addition to the $50,000 provided to the Embassy, </p><p>an additional $50,000 was provided by OFDA as part </p><p>of the disaster declaration for use for an </p><p>assessment. </p><p> </p><p>C) Lack of communications, isolation of many </p><p>Maoist affected areas, and the press embargo which </p><p>is part of the state of emergency, combine to </p><p>severely limit the ability of external </p><p>organizations to confidently assess the magnitude </p><p>of the insurgency\'s affect on the civilian </p><p>population. It is hoped that a better picture can </p><p>be developed when ICRC teams currently in the </p><p>field return to Kathmandu next week.  The UNOCHA </p><p>representative who was in Nepal for the last two </p><p>weeks as part of a conflict assessment team, </p><p>reported in a de-briefing meeting today that he </p><p>had not found it possible to gather anything more </p><p>than anecdotal information regarding IDPs and the </p><p>humanitarian needs in the country. </p><p> </p><p>5) In regard to the conflict, to date USAID/Nepal </p><p>has taken the following action: </p><p> </p><p>A)   Worked to establish a Mission Interagency </p><p>Committee to focus on the coordinated deployment </p><p>of individual agency resources to best assist the </p><p>GON to resolve the conflict and restore political </p><p>stability. The Committee has established a common </p><p>set of goals and objectives across all agencies, </p><p>including the military. Ambassador Malinowski is </p><p>actively leading the USG effort. </p><p>B)   Conducted an assessment on service delivery </p><p>and also produced a report, "Democratic Governance </p><p>Under Threat", which establishes a common history </p><p>and intellectual understanding of events in Nepal. </p><p>Copies are available from the Nepal Desk Officer. </p><p>C)   Gained approval for a Special Strategic </p><p>Objective (SpO) which directly addresses the </p><p>conflict. The SpO has 4 components: 1) Employment </p><p>generation and the provision/rehabilitation of </p><p>basic infrastructure; 2) Support to victims of </p><p>torture, returned combatants and internally </p><p>displaced persons; 3) Technical assistance and </p><p>policy dialogue to strengthen GON policy </p><p>decisions; and 4) Short-term Local Governance </p><p>Activities. </p><p>D)   Established a database of information </p><p>including maps and charts regarding the course of </p><p>the conflict and is exploring incorporating this </p><p>into a GIS system. </p><p>E)   Established a Special Projects Office to </p><p>implement the SpO and staffed it. </p><p>Note: USAID/Nepal is hiring a GIS specialist to </p><p>integrate data wit </p><p>h GIS mapping systems, a USPSC </p><p>DG/Conflict Specialist and a USPSC Manager for the </p><p>Infrastructure Program. </p><p>F) Mission is coordinating with other donors to </p><p>develop a common position with the GON regarding </p><p>corruption, and the need to structure </p><p>interventions to reach the local level as rapidly </p><p>as possible. The WB, ADB, and DFID are negotiating </p><p>with the GON to establish conditions to </p><p>"irrevocably change" the way funds are distributed </p><p>to local bodies. The initial emphasis is on </p><p>providing education and health services to rural </p><p>areas. </p><p> </p><p>G) Under the SO5 Governance program, USAID/Nepal </p><p>is focusing on strengthening the demand for </p><p>services and improving accountability and </p><p>transparency in the financial management of public </p><p>resources. and </p><p> training for local elected officials, </p><p>particularly women </p><p> </p><p>In addition, USAID is part of the Donors\' Peace </p><p>Support Group, and participates in various donor </p><p>sector groups, and frequently confers with DFID, </p><p>GTZ, DANIDA, and representatives of the Japanese </p><p>and Australian governments on the conflict. U.S. </p><p>diplomatic efforts are ongoing and a needs </p><p>assessment by a military team was recently </p><p>completed. </p><p> </p><p> USAID/Nepal is working with PPC/PDC staff to look </p><p>at additional conflict mitigation factors. </p><p>USAID/Nepal is also planning in-depth analyses for </p><p>new, related EG and DG strategies within the </p><p>context of the conflict. The contact person in the </p><p>ANE Bureau handling strategy issues is Rebecca </p><p>Cohn. Bernadette Bundy is the Nepal desk officer. </p><p>Azza el-Abd heads USAID/Nepal\'s Special Projects </p><p>Office. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
