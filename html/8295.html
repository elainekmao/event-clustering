SUMMARY:  THE RECENT ATTACKS AGAINST U.S. SOLDIERS IN IRAQ </p><p>AND THE ISRAELI CABINET\'S RESERVATIONS ON THE ROADMAP DOMINATED </p><p>COVERAGE IN UAE PRINT AND ELECTRONIC MEDIA.  AN "AL ITTIHAD" </p><p>EDITORIAL COMMENTED ON THE SITUATION IN IRAQ AND RECOMMENDED </p><p>MEANS TO ACHIEVE SECURITY AND STABILITY IN IRAQ.

IRAQ STILL REQUIRES A SERIOUS EFFORT TO ESTABLISH POLITICAL </p><p>AND SOCIAL STABILITY AND PUBLIC SECURITY IN ORDER FOR </p><p>RECONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES TO BEGIN.  THIS DEMANDS THE ESSENTIAL </p><p>SOLIDARITY OF U.S., UK, ARAB, AND INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS IN </p><p>ADDITION TO GIVING A VITAL AND EFFECTIVE ROLE TO IRAQI </p><p>PEOPLE ..." </p><p> </p><p>3.  UNDER THE HEADLINE "PALESTINIAN CAUTION REQUESTED," SHARJAH- </p><p>BASED PAN-ARAB DAILY "AL KHALEEJ" EDITORIALIZED 5/27: </p><p> </p><p>"... THE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY SHOULD BE VERY CAUTIOUS TOWARDS </p><p>THE TEMPTATIONS THAT ARE SYMBOLIZED IN MEETINGS AND PRAISE </p><p>WASHINGTON WANTS TO IMPOSE (ON THE PA), THAT IS BECAUSE THE </p><p>DESTINY OF A WHOLE NATION IS AT STAKE, AND ANY NEGLIGENCE OF ITS </p><p>RIGHTS TO ITS LAND, PALESTINE, WILL DRAG ON INFINITELY UNTIL THEY </p><p>(PALESTINIAN RIGHTS) ARE ALL CROSSED OUT.

IT HAS BECOME EVIDENT THAT THE AMERICANS, BY BEING SO </p><p>AMBIGUOUS AND BY PREVENTING THE IRAQIS FROM DECIDING THE FUTURE </p><p>OF THEIR OWN COUNTRY, WANT CHAOS TO ROLE IRAQ... THE AMERICANS </p><p>APPEAR TO BE RENEGING ON THEIR PROMISES TO LEAVE IRAQ AND HAND IT </p><p>OVER TO THE IRAQIS ONCE THEIR MISSION IS OVER... " </p><p> </p><p>"... ACTUALLY WHAT THEY HAVE DONE SO FAR IS THAT THEY HAVE LOOKED </p><p>AFTER THEIR OWN OCCUPATION FORCES IN IRAQ.  WE HAVE NOT YET SEEN </p><p>ANY REAL ASSISTANCE PROVIDED BY THE AMERICANS, WHETHER IN </p><p>EDUCATION, HEALTH AND EVEN COMMUNICATION.  AS WE SEE IT, THE </p><p>AIRPORT IN BAGHDAD IS STILL CLOSED ALTHOUGH IT SHOULD BE REOPENED </p><p>SO THAT MORE AID WILL FLOW INTO THE COUNTRY... IT IS THEIR </p><p>DELIBERATE POLICY TO EXCLUDE ALL IRAQI INTELLECTUALS AND EXPERTS </p><p>IN MANY FIELDS INCLUDING POLITICS, ECONOMY, SCIENCE AND </p><p>CULTURE ..." </p><p> </p><p>"... THE IRONY IS THAT A LITTLE-KNOWN U.S. EXPERT, NOAH FELDMAN, </p><p>32, HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN TO HELP CHART IRAQ\'S CONSTITUTION WHEN </p><p>THE COUNTRY IS KNOWN TO POSSESS TOP LEGAL EXPERTS.  AND IRAQ IS </p><p>CONSIDERED THE CRADLE OF THE FIRST MAN MADE LAWS IN HISTORY.  THE </p><p>U.S. IS RUNNING IRAQ IN AN IGNORANT AND ARROGANT FASHION ... THE </p><p>U.S. SUCCESS IN PUSHING A UN RESOLUTION TO LIFT THE SANCTIONS </p><p>AGAINST IRAQ WAS INTERPRETED BY SOME AS A MOVE TO LEGALIZE THE </p><p>OCCUPATION OF IRAQ.  BUT IT ALSO REMOVES ALL AMERICAN EXCUSES </p><p>ABOUT LACK OF FUNDS TO REBUILD THE COUNTRY... " </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
