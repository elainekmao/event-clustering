<p>S E C R E T ABU DHABI 002860 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARP AND NEA/IPA </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR THEROUX </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/14/08 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PTER, KPAL, KWBG, TC </p><p>SUBJECT:  ORAL MESSAGE ON NEED TO HALT </p><p>ASSISTANCE TO HAMAS DELIVERED; </p><p> UAE DISMAYED BY NEW VIOLENCE </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A) STATE 157973 </p><p> </p><p>      B) 02 ABU DHABI 3193 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba </p><p>for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) The Ambassador delivered Ref A demarche on </p><p>the need for governments to move decisively against </p><p>entities providing financial support to Hamas in a </p><p>June 11 meeting with MFA Minstate Hamdan (other </p><p>topics covered septel).  Hamdan expressed </p><p>appreciation for President Bush\'s position on the </p><p>Israeli strike against Hamas leader Abdulaziz Al- </p><p>Rantissi, noting the UAEG view that Israel seems </p><p>bound and determined to wreck the roadmap, thus </p><p>undoing the hard work of President Bush, the </p><p>Quartet, the Europeans and moderate Arab leaders. </p><p>He regretted the tit-for-tat violence that has </p><p>erupted between the Israelis and Palestinians, </p><p>fearing that this setback would only feed further </p><p>extremism and increase regional instability. </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) UAE Armed Forces Chief of Staff Muhammad bin </p><p>Zayid Al-Nahyan (MbZ), in a meeting with the </p><p>Ambassador later the same day, said Israel\'s </p><p>targeted assassinations of Hamas leaders created </p><p>more "martyrs" for the extremist cause.  While </p><p>Hamas is strengthened by these attacks, Abu Mazen </p><p>and the Palestinians who need our collective </p><p>support are further marginalized. </p><p> </p><p>4. (S) The Ambassador briefed both Emirati leaders </p><p>on the appointment of Ambassador John Wolf, noting </p><p>his intention to travel to the region by the end of </p><p>the week to coordinate implementation of the </p><p>roadmap. </p><p> </p><p>5. (S) Hamdan shared that the Israelis had broken </p><p>into the Jerusalem-based office of the UAE Red </p><p>Crescent Authority not long ago.  The office was </p><p>ransacked and a number of files taken.  Hamdan has </p><p>dispatched an emissary to speak with GOI officials </p><p>about the break-in and convey the UAEG\'s desire to </p><p>work together in the future. </p><p> </p><p>6. (S) Comment:  The Emiratis have little tolerance </p><p>for those individuals and organizations providing </p><p>financial support for Hamas.  The leadership has </p><p>demonstrated its commitment to do the utmost </p><p>possible to end such support coming from private </p><p>sources in the UAE (Ref B) and we are currently </p><p>working with the UAEG to investigate the activities </p><p>of a UAE-based NGO -- Human Appeal International -- </p><p>which has been linked with providing support for </p><p>Hamas, among other terrorist organizations (see </p><p>septel).  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
