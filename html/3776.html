<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ALGIERS 002423 </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR S/CT, AF, IO </p><p>NSC FOR CORVILLE </p><p>EMBASSIES PASS TO DAO </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/13/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PREL, AG </p><p>SUBJECT: AU COUNTERTERRORISM CONFERENCE RESULTS </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: AMBASSADOR JANET A. SANDERSON FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p>1.(U) THE AFRICAN UNION COUNTER-TERRORISM CONFERENCE, HELD IN </p><p>ALGIERS SEPTEMBER 11-14, RESULTED IN A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES </p><p>REPORTING THAT THEY WOULD RATIFY THE 1999 ALGIERS CONVENTION </p><p>ON THE PREVENTION AND COMBATING OF TERRORISM, A PLAN OF </p><p>ACTION TO IMPLEMENT THE 1999 CONVENTION, AND AN AGREEMENT TO </p><p>ESTABLISH AN AFRICAN COUNTER-TERRORISM CENTER.  IF THE </p><p>COUNTRIES CLAIMING TO HAVE RATIFIED THE CONVENTION DEPOSIT </p><p>THEIR RESPECTIVE INSTRUMENTS WITHIN THE REQUIRED TIME, THE </p><p>CONVENTION - AND ITS EXEMPTION OF "FREEDOM FIGHTERS" FROM A </p><p>DEFINITION OF TERRORISM - WILL ENTER INTO FORCE.  WHILE </p><p>VARIOUS AFRICAN DELEGATES MADE ELOQUENT AND IMPASSIONED </p><p>PRESENTATIONS, IT WAS CLEAR THAT THE ALGERIANS HAD THE </p><p>DOMINANT AGENDA AND USED THE MEETING TO SHOWCASE THEIR WON </p><p>WAR ON TERRORISM, AS WELL AS THEIR AFRICAN CREDENTIALS.  IN </p><p>THAT, THEIR PURPOSES WERE LARGELY MET.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>BOUTFLIKA\'S MESSAGE ON TERRORISM AIMS AT HOME -- AND ABROAD </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.(U) THE CONFERENCE OPENED WITH PRESIDENT ABDELAZIZ </p><p>BOUTEFLIKA ADDRESSING THE DELEGATES AND EXPRESSING HIS </p><p>SYMPATHY FOR THE "GREAT AMERICAN PEOPLE." THE PRESIDENT SPOKE </p><p>OF AMERICANS AND ALGERIANS SHARING SADNESS AND ABOUT OUR </p><p>COMMON WORK TO ERADICATE TERRORISM.  HE EXPRESSED HIS VIEW </p><p>THAT THE AU MEETING IN ALGIERS WAS "A SIGNIFICANT MARK OF </p><p>RESPECT AND SOLIDARITY WITH THE ALGERIAN PEOPLE AND A HOMAGE </p><p>TO THEIR LONG, DIFFICULT BATTLE AGAINST TERRORISM."  HOEVER, </p><p>HE COMPLAINED,AS HE HAS IN THE PAST, THAT THE WORLD HAS BEEN </p><p>TOO LONG SILENT ABOUT ALGERIA\'S OWN STRUGGLE WITH TERRORISM. </p><p>HE DREW A CLEAR LINK BETWEEN TERRORISM AND INTERNATIONAL </p><p>CRIME, NOTING THAT THE GREAT CHALLENGE OF THE 21ST CENTURY </p><p>WILL BE TO ERADICATE "INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM"  HE CALLED FOR </p><p>INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE TO FACE THIS CHALLENGE, ASKING, </p><p>"WOULD YOU DEPRIVE US OF THIS ASSISTANCE WHILE WE ARE </p><p>FIGHTING TOGETHER?" HE ALSO ENCOURAGED THE CREATION OF AN </p><p>AFRICAN CENTER TO STUDY SECURITY AND TO FIGHT TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>3.(U) TURNING HIS ATTENTION TO THE 1999 ALGIERS CONVENTION ON </p><p>COMBATING AND PREVENTION OF TERRORISM, HE CALLED FOR A </p><p>DOCUMENT THAT WOULD BAN TERRORISM IN ALL ITS FORMS AND </p><p>LAMENTED THE FACT "THAT IT HASN\'T HAPPENED YET."  BOUTEFLIKA </p><p>THEN SHIFTED INTO A DISCUSSION OF THE SPECIFIC TERRORIST </p><p>PROBLEMS FACING ALGERIA.  HE REMINDED THE AUDIENCE THAT </p><p>ALGERIANS ARE MUSLIMS AND THAT THEY CALL FOR AN ERADICATION </p><p>OF TERRORISM.  ALGERIANS, ACCORDING TO BOUTEFLIKA, HAVE NEVER </p><p>HESITATED TO DENOUNCE TERRORISM, EVEN WHEN IT HIDES BEHIND </p><p>ISLAM. </p><p> </p><p>4.(U) DEPARTING FROM HIS PREPARED TEXT, BOUTEFLIKA STRONGLY </p><p>ATTACKED THOSE WHO HAD CRITIZED HIS POLICY OF RECONCILATION </p><p>AND "CONCORD CIVIL" IN THE WAKE OF ALGERIA\'S OWN WAR ON </p><p>TERRORISM. HE EXPLAINED THAT DEMOCRACY MEANS YOU HAVE TO </p><p>LISTEN TO OTHER\'S OPINIONS.  ACCORDING TO HIS VISION, CHANGE </p><p>SHOULD COME THROUGH DIALOGUE, NOT VIOLENCE.  BOUTEFLIKA URGED </p><p>THAT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY DEAL WITH THE ROOT CAUSES OF </p><p>TERRORISM AND IN A REFERENCE TO BOTH ALGERIA\'S PAST AS WELL </p><p>AS THE PALESTINIAN CAUSE, HE SAID, "INTERNATIONAL </p><p>COUNTERTERRORISM STRATEGY AND THE STRUGGLE AGAINST TERRORISM </p><p>MUST ALSO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE NEED TO PROVIDE JUSTICE TO </p><p>THOSE WHO HAVE NO OTHER RECOURSE BUT ARMED STRUGGLE TO </p><p>VALIDATE THEIR RIGHT TO EXIST AND TO DEMAND THEIR PLACE IN </p><p>THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. THE LEGITIMATE RESISTANCE OF </p><p>SUCH PEOPLE, OFTEN SUPPORTED BY MODEST EFFORTS AND A LIMITED </p><p>WILL, SHOULD NOT BE ANY WAY ASSOCIATED WITH TERRORISM.  THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY...MUST MEET ITS REPSONSIBLITIES TO </p><p>PROVIDE LAW AND JUSTICE, MOST NOTABLY FOR THE WEAKEST AND THE </p><p>MOST DOWNTRODDEN.  THAT IS THE BEST GUARANTEE OF LONGLASTING </p><p>PEACE AND STABILITY." </p><p> </p><p>YOU WIN SOME... </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.(U) DURING THE OPENING SESSION OF THE CONFERENCE, DELEGATES </p><p>FROM SUDAN, SOUTH AFRICA AND GHANA REPORTED THAT THEIR </p><p>COUNTRIES HAD RATIFIED THE 1999 ALGIERS CONVENTION AND THAT </p><p>THE INSTRUMENTS WOULD BE DEPOSITED WITH THE AU SHORTLY.  WHEN </p><p>THE LAST OF THESE INSTRUMENTS HAVE BEEN DEPOSITED, THE </p><p>CONVENTION WILL ENTER INTO FORCE AND THE AU WILL OFFICIALLY </p><p>EXEMPT THOSE INVOLVED IN A "STRUGGLE WAGED BY PEOPLES IN </p><p>ACCORDANCE WITH THE PRINCIPLES OF INTERNATIONAL LAW FOR THEIR </p><p>LIBERATION OR SELF-DETERMINATION, INCLUDING THE ARMED </p><p>STRUGGLE AGAINST COLONIALISM, OCCUPATION, AGGRESSION AND </p><p>DOMINATION BY FOREIGN FORCES" FROM ITS DEFINITION OF </p><p>TERRORISM.  THERE WAS NO DEBATE, OR EVEN A SPECIFIC MENTION </p><p>ABOUT THIS EXEMPTION.  MANY OF THE DELEGATIONS INVITED AS </p><p>OBSERVERS SEEMED NONCHALANT ABOUT THE CLAUSE, INCLUDING THE </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES FROM MALAYSIA, SPAIN, FRANCE AND ENGLAND. </p><p>SEVERAL DELEGATIONS PRAISED THE REPORTS OF RATIFICATION, </p><p>NOTING THAT IT HAS TAKEN THREE YEARS TO GET RATIFICATION FROM </p><p>THE REQUISITE 15 COUNTRIES. </p><p> </p><p>7.(U) A LARGE PART OF THE CONFERENCE WAS SPENT ON A PROPOSED </p><p>PLAN OF ACTION TO IMPLEMENT THE 1999 CONVENTION.  ALTHOUGH </p><p>MUCH DEBATE WAS HAD ON "THE USE OF COMMAS AND FULL STOPS," </p><p>THERE WAS LITTLE SUBSTANTIVE DISCUSSION ON THE PLAN\'S SCOPE, </p><p>LIMITATIONS OR FUNDING.  A COPY OF THE FINAL PLAN OF ACTION </p><p>WILL BE DELIVERED TO DEPARTMENT SEPARATELY. </p><p> </p><p>...AND YOU LOSE SOME </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.(U) BY THE TIME AN AGREEMENT WAS REACHED ON THE PLAN OF </p><p>ACTION, MOST DELEGATES WERE IN NO MOOD TO CONTINUE INTO THE </p><p>NIGHT TO DISCUSS A PROPOSED PROTOCOL TO THE 1999 CONVENTION. </p><p>THE PROTOCOL WAS MOSTLY AUTHORED BY THE SENEGALESE, AS A </p><p>CAPSTONE TO THEIR DAKAR DECLARATION OF OCTOBER 1998.  AFTER </p><p>MAKING A STRONG ARGUMENT FOR THE NEED FOR SUCH A PROTOCOL, </p><p>THE SENEGALESE DELEGATION GLUMLY SAT THROUGH A NUMBER OF </p><p>ARGUMENTS AGAINST IT.  THE SENEGALESE DEFENDED THE PROTOCOL, </p><p>CLAIMING THE 1999 CONVENTION NEEDED ENHANCEMENT IN ORDER TO </p><p>ADDRESS ISSUES THAT WERE UNFORESEEN THREE YEARS AGO, </p><p>INCLUDING THE NEED TO CRIMINALIZE MONEY LAUNDERING AND OTHER </p><p>SIMILAR TOPICS. </p><p> </p><p>9.(C) REALIZING THAT A CONSENSUS TO KILL THE PROTOCOL WAS </p><p>BUILDING (AND THAT IT WAS NEARLY 11 P.M.), THE ALGERIAN </p><p>CHAIRMAN PUT AN END TO THE DEBATE AND DECREED THAT THE </p><p>DELEGATES SHOULD COLLECT FURTHER OPINIONS ON THE PROPOSED </p><p>PROTOCOL AND THAT IT WOULD BE DEBATED AT THE NEXT AU SUMMIT. </p><p>(COMMENT. THE PROPOSED TERRORISM PROTOCOL COULD BE </p><p>PROBLEMATIC: IT INCLUDES AN ARTICLE -- DEALING WITH THE PEACE </p><p>AND SECURITY COUNCIL -- WHICH GIVES AUTHORITY TO THE COUNCIL </p><p>TO "MAKE APPROPRIATE CONTACTS WITH MEMBER STATES AS WELL AS </p><p>NON-MEMBER STATES ON ALL MATTERS RELATING TO TERRORISM AND </p><p>THE ACTIVITIES OF TERRORIST GROUPS."  DEPENDING UPON THE </p><p>INTERPRETATION AND EXECUTION OF THIS ARTICLE, IT MAY AFFECT </p><p>USG CT EFFORTS ON A BILATERAL BASIS.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>NOT JUST ANOTHER PIECE OF PAPER </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.(U) MUCH OF THE DEBATE, ON BOTH THE PLAN OF ACTION AND THE </p><p>PROTOCOL, CENTERED ON A DIFFERENT PROTOCOL WHICH HAS NOT YET </p><p>ENTERED INTO FORCE.  THIS PROTOCOL, RELATING TO THE </p><p>ESTABLISHMENT OF THE PEACE AND SECURITY COUNCIL (PSC WAS </p><p>ISSUED AND SIGNED BY HEADS OF STATE AT THE DURBAN AU SUMMIT </p><p>IN JULY 2002.  (NOTE:  THIS PROTOCOL ALSO CALLS FOR "PANEL OF </p><p>THE WISE," A CONTINENTAL EARLY WARNING SYSTEM, AN AFRICAN </p><p>STANDBY FORCE, AND A "PEACE-BUILDING CAPACITY."  END NOTE) </p><p>AU OFFICIALS TOLD USDEL THAT A SIMPLE MAJORITY OF AU MEMBERS </p><p>ARE EXPECTED TO RATIFY THE PROTOCOL IN TIME TO BE EFFECTIVE </p><p>BY THE NEXT AU SUMMIT, IN MAPUTO IN 2003. </p><p> </p><p>11.(C) ACCORDING TO AN OFFICIAL VERSION OF THE PROPOSED </p><p>PROTOCOL, THE PSC WILL CONSIST OF 15 COUNTRIES, THREE EACH </p><p>FROM FIVE AFRICAN REGIONS.  ALTHOUGH THERE ARE CRITERIA </p><p>LISTED FOR MEMBERSHIP TO THE PSC, AU OFFICIALS CLAIM THAT </p><p>COUNTRIES LIKE SUDAN, LIBERIA, ZIMBABWE COULD NEVER SERVE ON </p><p>THE PSC - OR MORE IMPORTANTLY, SERVE AS THE CHAIR - BECAUSE </p><p>OF THESE CRITERIA.  WHEN PRESSED FOR DETAILS OF THE VETTING </p><p>PROCESS, AN AU OFFICIAL CONCEDED THAT IT WOULD BE THROUGH </p><p>"PEER PRESSURE."  ACCORDING TO THE PROTOCOL, THE PSC WILL BE </p><p>RESPONSIBLE FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE 1999 CONVENTION ON </p><p>TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>WE SAID IT FIRST </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.(U) AFTER A SPIRITED DEBATE OVER THE FUNDING AND SCOPE OF </p><p>THE PROPOSAL FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A TERRORISM STUDY AND </p><p>RESEARCH CENTER, THE ALGERIAN DELEGATION STRONG-ARMED THE </p><p>DELEGATES INTO ACCEPTING ALGERIA AS THE CENTER\'S SITE.  THE </p><p>SOUTH AFRICAN DELEGATION ARGUED THAT REGIONAL CAPACITY SHOULD </p><p>BE DEVELOPED BEFORE ATTEMPTING TO HAVE A CONTINENTAL PROGRAM. </p><p> THEY CLAIMED THAT THE IMMEDIATE ESTABLISHMENT OF SUCH A </p><p>CENTER WOULD WEAKEN MANY BILATERAL RELATIONSHIPS IN THE AREAS </p><p>OF TRAINING, COOPERATION, AND FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE.  THE </p><p>TANZANIAN DELEGATION AGREED THAT A NEED FOR THE CENTER </p><p>EXISTS, BUT INSISTED THAT THE DEVIL WAS IN THE DETAILS. </p><p>ADDITIONALLY, THE DELEGATIONS FROM BURKINA FASO, KENYA AND </p><p>SUDAN ASKED FOR MORE TIME TO STUDY THE PROPOSAL.  THE </p><p>CHAIRMAN WENT ON TO MAKE THE ARGUMENT THAT TERRORISM DOESN\'T </p><p>WAIT, IT STRIKES QUICKLY.  HE CLAIMED THAT THE TERRORISM </p><p>CENTER WOULD ANSWER THE CONCERNS EXPRESSED BY ALL AU MEMBERS. </p><p> </p><p>13.(U) BOTH THE ALGERIAN DELEGATION AND THE INTERIM </p><p>COMMISSIONER FOR THE PSC, ALGERIAN SAID DJINNIT, ARGUED THAT </p><p>THE DECISION FOR AN AFRICAN CT CENTER WAS MADE AT THE AU </p><p>SUMMIT IN DURBAN.  CITING AN AU TRADITION THAT ONCE A </p><p>DECISION IS MADE AT THE SUMMIT LEVEL, MEMBER COUNTRIES HAVE </p><p>ALWAYS ACCEPTED IT, THE ALGERIAN CHAIRMAN OF THE CONFERENCE </p><p>DECLARED THAT ALGERIA WOULD BE THE LOCATION FOR THE CT </p><p>CENTER.  BESIDES, HE ADDED, ALGERIA HAD BEEN THE ONLY COUNTRY </p><p>TO MAKE AN OFFER TO HOST THE CENTER.  HE CONTINUED THAT </p><p>ALTHOUGH THE CT CENTER WOULD FOLLOW THE AU\'S TRADITION OF </p><p>FUNDING FROM THE ORDINARY BUDGET, THE ALGERIANS WOULD BE </p><p>LOOKING FOR BUDGET CONTRIBUTIONS, EVEN SYMBOLIC ONES. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>14.(C) WHILE THE MEETING MAY NOT HAVE ENDED EXACTLY AS THE </p><p>ALGERIANS WOULD HAVE WANTED, THEY WERE SUCCESSFUL ON SEVERAL </p><p>COUNTS.  BOUTEFLIKA, THROUGH HIS HOSTING OF THE CONFERENCE ON </p><p>THE FIRST ANNIVERSARY OF THE SEPTEMBER 11 ATTACKS, ARTFULLY </p><p>DEMONSTRATED HIS SOLIDARITY WITH THE US AND THE GLOBAL </p><p>COALITION IN THE CAMPAIGN AGAINST TERRORISM.  A TERRORISM </p><p>CENTER WILL BE ESTABLISHED IN (AND BENEFIT) ALGERIA WITH THE </p><p>AU\'S IMPRIMATUR.  IT WAS CLEAR THROUGHOUT THE MEETING THAT </p><p>THE EGYPTIANS AND THE ALGERIANS PLAN TO CONTROL THE AFRICAN </p><p>CT CAMPAIGN, EITHER BY FORCE OF THEIR EFFORTS OR THROUGH THE </p><p>LACK OF CAPACITY OF OTHER AU MEMBERS. </p><p> </p><p>15.(C) THE BEST SUMMARY OF THIS CONFERENCE MAY BE IN AN </p><p>ANECDOTE PROVIDED BY A YOUNG AU STAFFER FROM ADDIS ABABA. </p><p>ACCORDING TO THE STAFFER, THE PLAN WAS TO ONLY DISTRIBUTE THE </p><p>DELEGATES\' PER DIEM ON THE VERY LAST DAY OF THE MEETING, THUS </p><p>ENSURING THE MAXIMUM PARTICIPATION OF EACH OF THE DELEGATIONS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SANDERSON </p><p></p></div>
