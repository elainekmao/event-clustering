<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 RANGOON 001557 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV, EB/IFD </p><p>COMMERCE FOR ITA JEAN KELLY </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA JEFF NEIL </p><p>CINCPAC FOR FPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/05/2012 </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, EIND, ECON, BM, Economy </p><p>SUBJECT: BURMA: BANKS AND CONSTRUCTION BOOMS, A BAD MIX </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: COM CARMEN MARTINEZ FOR REASONS 1.5 (B,D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: The puzzling construction boom, continuing in </p><p>Rangoon despite the dismal economy and an unclear demand, is </p><p>being fueled by speculation by builders and investors. </p><p>Unfortunately for the economy, private banks have not learned </p><p>the lessons of Japan and are throwing caution to the wind in </p><p>their financing of economically questionable construction </p><p>projects.  With their loan portfolios already grim, many of </p><p>these private banks could be wiped from the map if and when </p><p>the Central Bank ever takes steps to bring credit under </p><p>control.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>Paving Paradise </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Even in the midst of the country\'s economic crisis, </p><p>the construction industry in Rangoon is still relatively </p><p>active.  The newspapers regularly report on shining new </p><p>office or apartment complexes, and bamboo scaffolding is </p><p>evident on every block.  Part of the SPDC\'s drive to have a </p><p>"modern and developed" city is to make prime land readily </p><p>available for development.  These plots, owned either by the </p><p>Office of the Prime Minister\'s Yangon City Development </p><p>Council (YCDC) or the Department of Construction\'s Human </p><p>Settlement and Housing Development department, are put out </p><p>for bid.  Interested construction companies (or consortia) </p><p>negotiate with the owner for the right to build.  The firms </p><p>offer the respective government agency an equity share </p><p>(usually 30-50 percent of the space) in exchange for a </p><p>renewable 60-year lease.  The winning firm need not make any </p><p>official payments to the government in exchange for the </p><p>construction rights.  However, informal payments and close </p><p>connections with key government officials, especially </p><p>Secretary-1 General Khin Nyunt, are invaluable. </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Many of the largest construction firms are part of </p><p>keiretsu-style integrated holding companies that include a </p><p>major private bank.  In addition, lending rates, set </p><p>nationally by the Central Bank of Myanmar are about 15 </p><p>percent -- well below annual inflation rates.  Thus it is not </p><p>surprising that construction firms rely largely on bank </p><p>financing for their projects.  Financing is possible through </p><p>the pre-sale of apartments and office space.  Banks assist in </p><p>this as well by offering generous loans to potential </p><p>renters/buyers. </p><p> </p><p>If You Build It, Will They Come? </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Members of the country\'s largest construction </p><p>industry association told us that business is good because </p><p>demand for new housing and office space continues to be very </p><p>high.  They asserted that rapid construction of new </p><p>apartments is being pushed forward by Rangoon\'s population </p><p>growth.  (Note: This seems unlikely as the vast majority of </p><p>Rangoonites cannot afford the luxury apartments or offices </p><p>constructed by these firms.)  The builders said that in </p><p>addition, wealthy business people and high-ranking officers </p><p>are buying many of the new apartments, condos, and offices as </p><p>a hedge against a plummeting kyat. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) There is no question that real estate is now viewed </p><p>as the hedge of choice in an economy where anyone who can </p><p>afford to keeps their kyat holdings low.  However, it seems </p><p>unlikely that the minuscule upper class (even purchasing two </p><p>or more units as pure investments) could support ongoing and </p><p>planned construction.  An independent economist following the </p><p>construction sector said that construction firms are also </p><p>speculating, taking out cheap kyat loans and putting the </p><p>money into something more solid, even without reliable demand </p><p>projections.  Also, he noted, these construction firms were </p><p>taking their time in building, trying to whip up demand for </p><p>their "exclusive" properties along the way. </p><p> </p><p>Banks Rolling the Dice </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) As long as the government is eager to develop prime </p><p>downtown locations, construction firms can get unlimited </p><p>cheap loans, the kyat continues its decline, and the Rangoon </p><p>glitterati view real estate as a solid investment, the </p><p>construction bubble should continue to inflate despite the </p><p>economy\'s problems.  However, the participation in this boom </p><p>of many of the nation\'s private banks could be edging them </p><p>toward a Japan-style banking crisis.  All the signs are </p><p>there: an industry building excessively expecting the market </p><p>to remain high, unfettered bank lending to companies based on </p><p>personal connections rather than objective analysis of future </p><p>income potential, and collateral in real assets priced at </p><p>their inflated value.  The private banks here already suffer </p><p>from poor management, high reserve requirements, irrational </p><p>government-set lending and deposit rates, and high </p><p>non-performing loan portfolios.  A fall in real estate </p><p>prices, or a credit crunch imposed by the Central Bank, could </p><p>quickly ruin these banks by dumping on them an immense </p><p>additional burden of bad debt. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Comment: The question, then, is not whether the </p><p>private banks that binged on real estate will collapse, but </p><p>what the impact of their collapse will be.  The immediate </p><p>impact on society will not be great.  Certainly the </p><p>construction industry and a few other sectors dominated by </p><p>private firms will suffer from a reduction in their </p><p>free-flowing capital.  However, the formal private banking </p><p>sector in Burma is still small relative to the entire </p><p>economy.  Most individuals and most businesses will get by, </p><p>as they do now, without significant bank loans or deposits. </p><p>Few would suffer if some private banks went bad.  Longer </p><p>term, though, the effects would be more pronounced, </p><p>particularly if the Central Bank bails out failed banks by </p><p>essentially printing money.  The net result then could be a </p><p>de facto mass nationalization of the banks and another huge </p><p>setback for hopes of financial and economic reform.  End </p><p>comment. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
