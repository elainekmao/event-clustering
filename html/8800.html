<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 GUATEMALA 001548 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/16/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, KJUS, MOPS, GT </p><p>SUBJECT: RIOS MONTT STONED BY MOURNERS IN RABINAL </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. GUATEMALA 1530 </p><p> </p><p>     B. GUATEMALA 1479 </p><p>     C. GUATEMALA 962 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Acting PolCouns Rob Copley, for reasons 1.5 (b and d) </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Summary: During a poorly-timed campaign stop in the </p><p>highland town of Rabinal on June 15, former General and FRG </p><p>presidential candidate Rios Montt was greeted with stones and </p><p>bottles thrown by a group of war victims participating in an </p><p>inhumation of 67 community members killed by the army during </p><p>the internal conflict.  The FRG rally coincided with the </p><p>inhumation mass for victims of the Tres Cruces and Plan de </p><p>Sanchez massacres of 1981 and 1982.  Rios Montt was not </p><p>wounded in the fracas, though other members of his delegation </p><p>were.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Rumble in Rabinal </p><p>----------------- </p><p>2. (U) The FRG held a presidential campaign rally in Rabinal, </p><p>Baja Verapaz on June 14, on the same day that residents from </p><p>surrounding communities were holding an inhumation mass for </p><p>the remains of loved ones killed in a series of army </p><p>massacres during the conflict.  It appears that the FRG </p><p>national leadership was unaware that the inhumation was to </p><p>take place at the same time as the campaign rally.  Community </p><p>members carrying the coffins of their loved ones coincided </p><p>with the FRG rally in Rabinal\'s central square.  According to </p><p>press accounts, inflammatory rhetoric by FRG Congressman from </p><p>Baja Verapaz Juan Santa Cruz and other local FRG leaders </p><p>raised tensions with the hostile mourners.  Insults were </p><p>exchanged and the FRG leaders decided to move their rally to </p><p>another location, away from the inhumation ceremony.  At that </p><p>point Rios Montt, possibly unaware of the tension at the </p><p>earlier rally where he was not present, appeared and began </p><p>his speech.  Tensions boiled over when Santa Cruz (or his </p><p>wife--accounts vary) pushed a journalist, causing him to fall </p><p>from the podium.  People in the crowd, made up largely of </p><p>hostile participants in the inhumations, began throwing </p><p>rocks.  Rios Montt was only a few lines into his speech when </p><p>he was forced to evacuate the stand.  Chaos reigned for </p><p>several minutes while the FRG leaders retreated.  Several </p><p>young women wearing FRG T-shirts were harassed by the crowd, </p><p>which ripped their shirts off.  Numerous journalists and 10 </p><p>FRG loyalists reported minor injuries in the clash.  After </p><p>burning what remained of the FRG banners, the crowd proceeded </p><p>to El Calvario church for an emotional ceremony and the </p><p>re-burial of the 67 massacre victims. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) The FRG leadership, including Rios Montt, continued on </p><p>to another smaller rally in nearby Cubulco, this one </p><p>organized by former civil defense patrol members (ex-PAC). </p><p>The meeting had been specially arranged for the ex-PACs, </p><p>dozens of whom had traveled to Rabinal earlier, to respond </p><p>directly to their concerns over delays in compensation for </p><p>their war-time services promised by President Portillo. </p><p>Press reports claim that many ex-PACs walked out of the </p><p>meeting with the senior FRG leaders in frustration, and </p><p>others chanting "liar" in response to the FRG leaders\' </p><p>efforts to lower the expectations of compensation of the </p><p>former civil patrol members. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Zury Rios, who accompanied her father to the rally in </p><p>Rabinal, told us that her father was unaware of the </p><p>inhumation before arriving in Rabinal, and said the local </p><p>organizers had moved the stage to another part of town when </p><p>they realized that the two events would coincide.  Even so, </p><p>she said that the victims\' families, carrying the coffins of </p><p>their loved ones, followed them to the new location, and that </p><p>is when the confrontation took place.  She accused the police </p><p>of not stepping in to calm the crowd.  Zury Rios said that, </p><p>contrary to press accounts, her father was not injured in the </p><p>melee, but said that a member of the entourage standing next </p><p>to him was hit in the head by a rock, getting blood all over </p><p>Rios Montt\'s collar (which led the press to speculate that he </p><p>had been hit). </p><p> </p><p>Forensic Anthropologists Threatened Beforehand </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>5. (SBU) The inhumation in Rabinal was organized by the </p><p>Forensic Anthropology Foundation of Guatemala (FAFG), which </p><p>continues to receive death threats for their work in Rabinal </p><p>and elsewhere.  On Friday, June 13, Fredy Peccerelli, </p><p>Director of the FAFG notified HROff that members of his staff </p><p>and family continue to receive threats from unidentified </p><p>sources, and most are not receiving protection from the GOG. </p><p>One member of his staff, Omar Bertoni Giron de Leon, received </p><p>a letter that said while Peccerelli had full-time security, </p><p>they knew Giron did not and that they would kill him if he </p><p>went into the countryside to perform the inhumation that </p><p>weekend (in Rabinal).  Peccerelli immediately contacted </p><p>police, Public Ministry, and the President\'s Commission on </p><p>Human Rights (COPREDEH) to obtain investigation of the threat </p><p>and security for Giron.  RSO contacted police, inquired into </p><p>their investigation of the Giron incident, and asked them to </p><p>follow up with any requests from the Peccerelli family. </p><p> </p><p>Frank LaRue Describes Incident in Rabinal </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>6. (C) On Saturday, June 14, Frank LaRue, Director of the </p><p>Center for Legal Action in Human Rights, called HROff to </p><p>share his concerns about the clash between FRG supporters and </p><p>those participating in the inhumation.  LaRue said that an </p><p>inhumation was an incredibly emotional event for the family </p><p>members of the 67 people being buried.  The timing of a </p><p>campaign rally for the retired General whose term as de facto </p><p>President partly coincides with the massacres in which these </p><p>individuals were killed could only be construed as </p><p>disrespectful.  LaRue also said that he feared events such as </p><p>this would further deepen the rift between the ex-PACS and </p><p>human rights activists, since FRG mayors and governors in </p><p>Quiche and Huehuetenango provinces have been blaming </p><p>difficulties in ex-PAC compensation packages on CALDH and </p><p>other human rights organizations associated with the victim\'s </p><p>reparations programs. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) LaRue predicted that the FRG would try to spin the </p><p>stoning incident as a ploy of the political opposition.  He </p><p>said that this was completely untrue and that all the members </p><p>of his organization and other human rights organizations were </p><p>not financially supported or motivated by opposition parties. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>8. (C)  The violence that erupted in Rabinal appears to have </p><p>been the result of poor planning by the local FRG campaign </p><p>leadership, and not an intentional provocation by either FRG </p><p>candidate Rios Montt or the families of the victims of army </p><p>massacres in Baja Verapaz.  Getting back up on the horse, </p><p>Rios Montt continued with scheduled campaign rallies in </p><p>Eastern Guatemala the next day.  A recent poll shows Rios </p><p>Montt has picked up some support since March, and currently </p><p>has 15.5 percent of the vote, placing him a distant second </p><p>behind Oscar Berger who has lost a couple points since March </p><p>and now stands at 41.9 percent of the vote.  Rios Montt\'s </p><p>negative vote (percentage of the populace who say they would </p><p>never vote for Rios Montt) has also grown, according to this </p><p>poll, from 51 to 53 percent in the same time period. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) The incident in Rabinal illustrates that scars from </p><p>the internal conflict remain close to the surface in </p><p>Guatemala, and reminds us that electoral violence can not be </p><p>ruled out.  The latest threats against FAFG members are </p><p>worrisome as human rights workers continue to be targets in </p><p>Guatemala, and few of their murders are ever prosecuted.  We </p><p>continue to raise our concerns over the security of human </p><p>rights workers with all senior GOG contacts, and have pressed </p><p>the police, the Minister of Government and the Attorney </p><p>General to ensure the safety of FAFG members in the wake of </p><p>this latest series of threats. </p><p>HAMILTON </p><p></p></div>
