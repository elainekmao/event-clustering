<p>UNCLAS KATHMANDU 000090 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/REIDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREF, PGOV, NP, IN, Bhutanese Refugees </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPALIS LAUNCH PRIVATE EFFORT TO SOLVE BHUTANESE </p><p>REFUGEE CRISIS </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary:  A team of distinguished Nepali former diplomats </p><p>and former officials met with Ambassador Malinowski on </p><p>January 17 to encourage US support for efforts to repatriate </p><p>Bhutanese refugees residing in seven camps in Eastern Nepal. </p><p>The delegation recently returned from a trip to New Delhi, </p><p>where they held similar meetings with the Ambassadors of </p><p>Bhutan\'s donor countries, hoping to encourage international </p><p>involvement.  Concerned that a failure to resolve the crisis </p><p>could result in radicalization of the refugee population and </p><p>aggravated regional instability, the group called for </p><p>increased pressure on the governments of Nepal and Bhutan, </p><p>and requested US assistance in convincing India to take a </p><p>more active role in the process of resolution. End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. In a January 17 meeting with Ambassador, representatives </p><p>of the Bhutanese Refugee Repatriation Support Group, Nepal </p><p>(BRRSG) encouraged US support for increasing pressure on </p><p>Bhutan to resolve the protracted refugee crisis that has </p><p>confined 100,000 Bhutanese to UNHCR-administered camps in </p><p>Nepal for thirteen years.  Citing a lack of employment </p><p>opportunities and a lack of facilities for higher education </p><p>as the causes, the five-member delegation reported increasing </p><p>frustration and anger among the youth of the refugee </p><p>community--some of whom have lived their entire lives in the </p><p>camps.  The group warned that the lack of progress toward a </p><p>solution "may cause problems" not just for Nepal and Bhutan, </p><p>but for India and other neighboring countries, and called on </p><p>the USG to help convince the Indian government to take a more </p><p>active role in settling the issue. </p><p> </p><p>3. Boasting an impressive membership of distinguished Nepali, </p><p>including former Foreign Minister Shailendra Kumar Upadhyaya, </p><p>former Foreign Secretary and former Ambassador to the </p><p>European Union Kedra Bhakta Shrestha, former Foreign </p><p>Secretary and former Secretary General of SAARC Yadav Kant </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Silwal, and former Ambassador to the United Nations Dr. Jay </p><p>Raj Acharya, the BRRSG\'s stated goal is "to repatriate all </p><p>Bhutanese refugees to Bhutan with full dignity, safety and </p><p>honor."  The group intends to "mobilize national and </p><p>international public opinion to solve the Bhutanese  refugee </p><p>problem as soon as possible." </p><p> </p><p>4. Toward that end, a delegation from the BRRSG recently </p><p>returned from a trip to New Delhi, where they met with the </p><p>diplomatic missions of Canada, Austria, Switzerland and the </p><p>Netherlands, seeking to enlist the assistance of those </p><p>countries in finding a swift and equitable solution to the </p><p>refugee crisis.  They characterized their reception as very </p><p>positive, and were encouraged by what they saw as the </p><p>willingness of the international community to take a hand in </p><p>resolving the situation.  In Kathmandu, in addition to their </p><p>meeting with Ambassador Malinowski and an earlier meeting </p><p>with the British Ambassador, the group plans to meet with the </p><p>Danish, Norwegian and German Embassies, and the resident EU </p><p>representative.  According to press reports, the team is </p><p>urging governments with foreign assistance programs in Bhutan </p><p>to withhold their aid if the Bhutanese government continues </p><p>to delay a solution to the problem. </p><p> </p><p>5. Comment:  Efforts to find a resolution to the Bhutanese </p><p>refugee crisis are welcome, especially when they are made by </p><p>as distinguished and reasonable a group as the members of the </p><p>BRRSG.  From a humanitarian standpoint, the continued impasse </p><p>on this issue is lamentable.  More pragmatically, increasing </p><p>impatience with the repatriation process, together with a </p><p>lack of opportunities for employment and education, have </p><p>created an environment in the camps conducive to homegrown </p><p>radicalism, and ripe for recruitment by the Maoists. </p><p>Bilateral efforts to resolve the problem have remained </p><p>stalled for too long.  This private initiative by the BRRSG, </p><p>in which well-respected Nepalis are seeking to </p><p>internationalize the issue and to engage the efforts of </p><p>countries with foreign aid programs or other influence in </p><p>Bhutan, is a positive new approach. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
