<p>S E C R E T KUWAIT 04869 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356 DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, KU </p><p>SUBJECT: TFKU01: WAR OF THE EMBASSIES SITREP: TURKS THROW IN THE </p><p>TOWEL AS GENERATORS RACK UP ANOTHER VICTUM </p><p> </p><p>1.  TURKISH AMBASSADOR INFORMED US THIS MORNING, AUGUST 28, THAT HE </p><p>HAS BEEN FORCED TO CLOSE HIS EMBASSY.  HE AND A REMAINING STAFF OF </p><p>11 WILL CLOSE THE DOORS TODAY AND DRIVE TO BAGHDAD, AND HOPEFULLY ON </p><p>TO ANKARA.  AMBASSADOR RECEIVED CLOSURE ORDERS FROM ANKARA AT 0100 </p><p>LKT.  DECISION TO CLOSE IS RESULT OF GENERATOR FAILURE, AND </p><p>CONSEQUENT FOOD SPOILAGE, NOT/NOT A CHANGE IN POLICY.  TURKS HAVE </p><p>BEEN AMONG THE TOUGHEST IN STANDING UP TO THE IRAQIS HERE, AND HAVE </p><p>BUILT MORE THAN ONE BACKBONE INTO A WEAKER EUROPEAN ALLY IN TOWN. </p><p> </p><p>2.  ASKED IF HE HAD COMMUNICATED HIS GOVERNMENT\'S DECISION TO LOCAL </p><p>IRAQI AUTHORITIES, AMBASSADOR DERISIVELY STATED "I AM NOT TALKING TO </p><p>THEM".  HE WILL SIMPLY GET IN EMBASSY CARS AND GO, AND IS TOYING </p><p>WITH THE IDEA OF LEAVING WITH FULL FLAGS FLYING.  HE EXPECTS TO </p><p>SPEND TUESDAY NIGHT IN BAGHDAD AND GO ON TO ANKARA AUGUST 29. </p><p> </p><p>3.  FOR BAGHDAD:  TURKISH AMBASSADOR WILL CONTACT YOU UPON </p><p>ARRIVAL.  PLEASE CONVEY WORD OF SAFE ARRIVAL TO US ASAP.  TURKISH </p><p>AMBASSADOR IS A STALWART FRIEND AND WE ARE SURE HE WOULD GLADLY TAKE </p><p>ANYTHING FOR BAGHDAD HE CAN CARRY. </p><p> </p><p>4.  FOR ANKARA: TURK\'S COMMO IS UNCERTAIN.  PLEASE INFORM GOT OF </p><p>CONVERSATION AND AMBASSADOR\'S PLANS. </p><p> </p><p>5. COMMENT:  THIS IS THE FOURTH EMBASSY WE KNOW OF THAT HAS </p><p>EXPERIENCED SEVERE GENERATOR PROBLEMS.  UK HAVE APPARENTLY REPAIRED </p><p>THEIRS, FOR NOW.  CANADIANS ARE WORKING ON FINDING A NEW BATTERY FOR </p><p>THEIRS.  JAPANESE ALMOST HAD TO LEAVE BECAUSE OF THEIRS.  WE SUSPECT </p><p>THERE ARE MANY OTHERS IN THE SAME FIX.  IT WILL BE A SAD IRONY IF </p><p>SADDAM IS ABLE TO FORCE US ALL OUT NOT BY BROKEN WILL, BUT BROKEN </p><p>GENERATORS.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HOWELL </p><p></p></div>
