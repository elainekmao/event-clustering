<p>UNCLAS ROME 19700 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: N/A </p><p>TAGS:  PREL IR IZ IT </p><p>SUBJECT:  GUILT FOR THE GULF WAR: IRAQ PAYS FOR AD TO </p><p>          GIVE ITS SIDE </p><p> </p><p>1.  THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT PAID FOR A HALF-PAGE </p><p>ADVERTISEMENT WHICH APPEARED IN THE AUGUST 25 ISSUE OF </p><p>ROME\'S CENTRIST "IL MESSAGGERO." ENTITLED "IRAN-IRAQ: </p><p>WHO STARTED THE WAR," THE IRAQI AD DETAILS "A SERIES </p><p>OF (IRANIAN) VIOLATIONS AND MILITARY AGGRESSIONS" </p><p>AGAINST IRAQ IN 1979 AND 1980, LEADING UP TO SEPTEMBER </p><p>22, 1980, WHEN IRAQ "WAS FORCED TO EXERCISE ITS RIGHT </p><p>TO LEGITIMATE DEFENSE."  THE IRAQI STATEMENT STRESSES </p><p>THAT, DESPITE IRAQ\'S "FAVORABLE ACCEPTANCE" OF </p><p>KHOMEINI\'S REGIME, IRAN "CLAIMED" ITS RIGHT TO </p><p>"EXPORT" THE ISLAMIC REVOLUTION "WITH THE USE OF </p><p>FORCE," SELECTING IRAQ AS ITS FIRST TARGET.  IRAN, THE </p><p>IRAQIS CLAIM, "INSTIGATED" CIVIL UNREST IN IRAQ, </p><p>HOSTED AND AIDED BARZANI\'S IRAQI-KURDISH OPPOSITION </p><p>GROUP, UNILATERALLY BACKED OUT OF THE IRAN/IRAQ 1975 </p><p>ACCORD ON THE SHATT-EL-ARAB, AND CARRIED OUT A SERIES </p><p>OF ATTACKS AGAINST IRAQI TERRITORY. </p><p> </p><p>2. COMMENT:  WITH THE DIRECT TALKS BETWEEN IRAN AND </p><p>IRAQ SET TO GET UNDERWAY IN GENEVA IT LOOKS LIKE THE </p><p>IRAQIS ARE AT LAST TRYING TO PUT OUT THEIR SIDE OF THE </p><p>STORY ON THE WAR\'S ORIGINS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>RABB </p><p></p></div>
