(C) Summary: IMF proposals for marginal economic reforms </p><p>in Burma have been brushed aside by the government.  Japanese </p><p>efforts to stimulate interest in reform in return for limited </p><p>adjustment aid will likely get a similarly cold reception. </p><p>Nonetheless, international financial bodies and donor </p><p>community experts should maintain contacts.  They need to </p><p>rebuild their knowledge of the Burmese economy.  They also </p><p>need to continue their economic education of the Burmese </p><p>technocrats who will one day be called on to administer an </p><p>economically viable state.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>Show Me the Money </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Traditionally the IMF\'s suggestions for incremental </p><p>economic reform fall on deaf ears here.  We understand that </p><p>the IMF will once again propose that the Burmese government </p><p>take marginal steps to: (1) begin to unify the market and </p><p>official exchange rates, (2) liberalize agricultural exports, </p><p>(3) improve tax collection, and (4) improve state-owned </p><p>enterprises\' budgetary discipline.  Although the IMF\'s report </p><p>of its July mission to Burma is not yet published, already </p><p>the word is that the Burmese government will ignore its </p><p>proposals.  The official line of the Burmese government has </p><p>long been that no economic reforms will be possible without a </p><p>large structural adjustment loan.  The IMF, restricted by </p><p>U.S. policy from extending new funding to Burma, has </p><p>repeatedly tried to convince the naysayers in Rangoon to </p><p>undertake limited, incremental reform measures that would not </p><p>require a large financial investment. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) A top Burmese businessman and former government </p><p>finance official said the regime was unlikely to shift its </p><p>position any time soon.  He said that the ruling generals are </p><p>fixated on national pride.  The government will dismiss all </p><p>IMF or World Bank advice as long as those institutions </p><p>"patronize" Burma and refuse to treat it like a full member </p><p>-- that is by giving it access to funding.  He admitted that </p><p>the Ministry of Finance had discussed repaying its </p><p>International Financial Institution (IFI) arrears as a "sign </p><p>of good faith," but ultimately rejected the notion on the </p><p>grounds that the gesture would not result in any new loans </p><p>coming Burma\'s way. </p><p> </p><p>Japan, Asia\'s Answer to the IMF </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The Japanese government is also getting in on the </p><p>economic advice game.  A large team of technical consultants </p><p>and scholars has been regularly visiting from Tokyo to work </p><p>with Burmese government officials on economic reform.  One of </p><p>the team\'s leaders, a professor of international studies from </p><p>Yokohama, told us that the Japanese government has had some </p><p>success in the region in the past where the IMF has failed, </p><p>getting Vietnam to accept conditionality for a 20 billion yen </p><p>bilateral economic adjustment loan.  Ideally, the team leader </p><p>claimed, the Japanese government would like to arrange for </p><p>Prime Minister Koizumi and Senior General Than Shwe to sign </p><p>off on a similar structural adjustment loan agreement during </p><p>the upcoming ASEAN leaders meeting in Cambodia. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) The team leader was not optimistic that the current </p><p>Burmese regime would adopt economic reform measures. </p><p>However, he was concerned that if no effort was made to push </p><p>reform, and to support the few reform-minded technocrats </p><p>here, then any new democratic government would inherit a </p><p>country with very dim economic prospects.  He felt that such </p><p>support would only be possible through a carefully monitored </p><p>and disbursed structural adjustment loan.  Further sanctions </p><p>or economic isolation, he posited, would sound a death knell </p><p>for budding reformers. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) No one is surprised that the ruling junta scoffs at </p><p>the IMF proposals.  Despite this, we think that the U.S. </p><p>government should encourage IMF and World Bank technical </p><p>missions to Burma, as long as they are not tied to any new </p><p>funding.  Even if the government will not listen to reason, </p><p>at least these IFIs can rebuild their knowledge base with a </p><p>view to providing critically necessary adjustment funding </p><p>quickly when and if a political change occurs.  Likewise we </p><p>think the Japanese should continue with their efforts. </p><p>Although we are dubious that the government will listen to </p><p>Japan any more than it will to the IMF, it is important for </p><p>communication to continue between Burma and donors on issues </p><p>of economic reform.  End comment. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
