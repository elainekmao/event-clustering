(U) Jordan\'s July 26 municipal elections suffered from low </p><p>voter turnout causing the government to extend balloting in 9 </p><p>of the 82 municipalities in which elections were held.  In 17 </p><p>other municipalities, elections were not held because the </p><p>number of candidates equaled the number of seats.  Final </p><p>results should be released on Sunday, July 27, following the </p><p>close of the second day of voting.  Jordan\'s Municipalities </p><p>Law requires 51 percent of eligible voters\' participation. </p><p>Preliminary results in cities that did not have to vote </p><p>indicates that at least 3 of the 46 women candidates won </p><p>their seats in Kufranja (near Ajloun), Irbid, and Deir Alla </p><p>(in the Jordan Valley). </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) In the Greater Amman Municipality, which is treated </p><p>separately from other city councils, low turnout resulted in </p><p>a second day of polling in 13 of the city\'s electoral </p><p>districts.  PolCouns, who toured the city on election day, </p><p>noted little campaign activity, few voters at polling </p><p>stations, and empty campaign buses. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) The Islamic Action Front, the political arm of the </p><p>Muslim Brotherhood, fielded 11 candidates in the Amman </p><p>municipal district, opting to boycott the remaining </p><p>municipalities to protest a new government amendment to the </p><p>elections law which authorizes the government to appoint a </p><p>maximum of 50 percent municipal council members in addition </p><p>to the mayors.  The government should announce on Tuesday, </p><p>July 28, after the Cabinet session the names of the appointed </p><p>council members and 99 mayors. </p><p>HALE </p><p></p></div>
