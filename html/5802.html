ALTHOUGH ALL LOCAL MEDIA REPORTED THAT AN ESTIMATED </p><p>10,000 PROTESTERS GATHERED IN ZAGREB, THE POLICE TOLD US </p><p>THAT THE NUMBER WAS BETWEEN 1,500 AND 2,000 PEOPLE.  THE </p><p>RALLY STARTED AT THE MAIN SQUARE IN DOWNTOWN ZAGREB WHERE </p><p>HALF A DOZEN INTELLECTUALS AND ARTISTS ADDRESSED THE CROWD. </p><p>THE MOST PROMINENT SPEAKER WAS FORMER SCIENCE AND ARTS </p><p>ACADEMY PRESIDENT IVAN SUPEK WHO CALLED FOR MOTHERHOOD AND </p><p>APPLE PIE VIRTUES SUCH AS UNIVERSAL DISARMAMENT AND A WORLD </p><p>COMMUNITY BASED ON SOLIDARITY AND PEACE.

THE ONLY INCIDENT DURING THE RALLY WE SAW IN FRONT OF </p><p>THE EMBASSY -- WHICH WAS GUARDED BY SOME 150 POLICE </p><p>OFFICERS -- WAS THE BURNING OF A U.S. FLAG "ADORNED" WITH </p><p>SWASTIKAS BY A GROUP OF ABOUT TWENTY INDIVIDUALS WHO </p><p>IDENTIFIED THEMSELVES AS "ANARCHISTS OF THE ANTI-FASCIST </p><p>ACTION," A GROUP WHOSE NAME SOUNDS EQUALLY ABSURD IN THE </p><p>ORIGINAL CROATIAN.  AFTER LESS THAN AN HOUR OF </p><p>DEMONSTRATIONS IN FRONT OF THE EMBASSY, PROTESTERS RETURNED </p><p>TO THE MAIN SQUARE TO SIGN PETITIONS AND DANCE TO MUSIC. </p><p> </p><p>6.
