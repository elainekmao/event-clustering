<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 002935 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/19/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR DELIVERS DEMARCHE ON REORGANIZATION OF </p><p>THE IRAQI MFA AND RECALL OF COM TO FONMIN MUASHER </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) STATE 126507 (B) AMMAN 2871 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edward W. Gnehm.  Reasons 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) The Ambassador delivered ref A demarche to Foreign </p><p>Minister Muasher May 19 during a meeting that covered a </p><p>number of issues (other topics reported septels).  (Note: </p><p>A/DCM had previously delivered the same message to Muasher\'s </p><p>personal assistant, Ali Al-Ayed on May 14 (ref B)). </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Muasher listened carefully to the Ambassador\'s </p><p>presentation and then offered the following comments:  The </p><p>GOJ no longer recognizes the Iraqi Ambassador as the </p><p>representative of Iraq.  However, King Abdullah has offered </p><p>him "protection" and, Muasher added, the Iraqi Ambassador has </p><p>not engaged in any activities related to the old regime since </p><p>its fall.  The issue of the Iraqi Ambassador\'s compliance </p><p>with the order issued by the newly-reconstituted Iraqi MFA is </p><p>"an issue between him and his Ministry."  If the Iraqi </p><p>Ambassador chooses to return to Iraq on his own, that\'s fine. </p><p> If, however, he refuses to return as ordered, then Jordan </p><p>"will have to look at what our obligations are under </p><p>international law."  The Ambassador also noted ref A </p><p>instructions that the Iraqi Embassy no longer had authority </p><p>to issue visas, use consular seals or carry out other </p><p>official duties.  Muasher underlined that he understood the </p><p>U.S.\'s concerns and interests as the occupying power, but </p><p>said he would have to consult with his legal experts before </p><p>providing a more definitive answer. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
