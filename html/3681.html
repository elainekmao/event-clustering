<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 TEGUCIGALPA 002530 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE PASS USTR: ANDREA GASH DURKIN </p><p>GUATEMALA FOR COMMATT: DTHOMPSON </p><p>STATE PASS AID FOR LAC </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, ECON, EFIN, EIND, PREL, PGOV, HO </p><p>SUBJECT: A/S REICH DISCUSSES TRADE AND INVESTMENT WITH THE </p><p>HONDURAN GOVERNMENT AND PRIVATE SECTOR LEADERS; STRONG </p><p>SUPPORT FOR USCAFTA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary.  WHA A/S Otto Reich, accompanied by WHA/CEN </p><p>Director Paul Trivelli, Ambassador, DCM, USAID Director and </p><p>EconCouns, discussed trade and investment issues over lunch </p><p>with Honduran government officials and private sector </p><p>leaders on August 28.  Both A/S Reich and the Honduran </p><p>participants, led by Vice President Vicente Williams, </p><p>confirmed their commitment in moving quickly on negotiations </p><p>for a U.S.-Central America free trade agreement, once </p><p>consultations with the U.S. Congress are completed.  The </p><p>Hondurans expressed great interest in A/S Reich\'s </p><p>discussions in Nicaragua of Nicaragua\'s 35 percent tariff on </p><p>Honduran imports.  The Hondurans emphasized that there is </p><p>increasing pressure to impose a retaliatory tariff and </p><p>requested the USG to use its good offices to help resolve </p><p>the issue.  VP Williams also discussed the Maduro </p><p>administration\'s efforts to combat corruption and improve </p><p>Honduras\' investment climate.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  WHA A/S Otto Reich, accompanied by WHA/CEN Director Paul </p><p>Trivelli, Ambassador, DCM, USAID Director, EconCouns and </p><p>EconOff (notetaker), attended a lunch with select GOH </p><p>officials and private sector leaders to discuss trade and </p><p>investment issues, especially a U.S.-Central America free </p><p>trade agreement (USCAFTA).  A/S Reich confirmed the USG\'s </p><p>intent to pursue free trade negotiations with Central </p><p>America and emphasized the importance of resolving border </p><p>conflicts to improving regional economic integration and </p><p>combating corruption in creating an attractive investment </p><p>climate.  WHA/CEN Trivelli noted that in order to build U.S. </p><p>congressional support for a USCAFTA, the GOH also needs to </p><p>make progress in addressing outstanding investment disputes </p><p>involving U.S. citizens. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Honduran participants included Vice President Vicente </p><p>Williams, who leads presidential commissions on the Plan </p><p>Puebla-Panama initiative and regional integration, Minister </p><p>of Industry and Trade Juliette Handal, Minister without </p><p>Portfolio for Investment Camilo Atala, Maquila Association </p><p>President Jesus Canahuati, FIDE (Foundation for Export </p><p>Promotion) President Norman Garcia, Honduran-American </p><p>Chamber of Commerce (Amcham) representative Jackie Foglia </p><p>and Ronald Barahona from COHEP, the private sector umbrella </p><p>group. </p><p> </p><p>4.  Much of the discussion revolved around Nicaragua\'s 35 </p><p>percent retaliatory tariff on Honduran imports over a </p><p>Caribbean maritime border dispute.  The Hondurans emphasized </p><p>that the tariff poses a major obstacle to CentAm free trade </p><p>negotiations with the U.S. and regional integration efforts. </p><p>The Hondurans argued that U.S. involvement in the issue </p><p>would be key to its resolution and requested the USG to use </p><p>its good offices to that end.  (Note: There is increasing </p><p>pressure in Honduras\' private sector and Congress to impose </p><p>retaliatory measures.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p>5.  In preparing for free trade talks with the U.S., </p><p>Minister Handal noted that there has been an unprecedented </p><p>level of cooperation and good will among CentAm trade </p><p>ministers since President Bush announced USG interest in a </p><p>free trade agreement with Central America on January 16. </p><p>CentAm trade officials have worked closely with each other </p><p>during preparatory meetings with U.S. trade officials and </p><p>have agreed to a common framework for the negotiations. </p><p>Minister Handal shared concerns about U.S. subsidies </p><p>expressed by the private sector (especially the agro- </p><p>industrial sector).  She expects that the Honduran </p><p>agriculture interests will push for exclusion of these </p><p>products from the negotiations, and flagged that U.S. </p><p>agriculture subsidies will have to be addressed in the </p><p>discussions. </p><p> </p><p>6.  On private sector participation, Minister Handal noted </p><p>the ministry\'s need for private sector market analysis in </p><p>preparing for the negotiations.  Speaking for Honduras\' </p><p>textile industry, Jesus Canahuati stated that Honduras\' </p><p>maquila sector is well organized for upcoming trade talks </p><p>and that there is already routine communication with the </p><p>U.S. textile industry and regional textile associations.  He </p><p>mentioned that a USCAFTA is essential for Honduras\' textile </p><p>industry to be able to compete after quotas are eliminated </p><p>in 2005.  Canahuati is also working with COHEP on organizing </p><p>the negotiating positions of other Honduran industries </p><p>(especially agriculture) and fostering communication within </p><p>the region.  Ultimately, they would like to create common </p><p>region-wide negotiating positions for each sector. </p><p> </p><p>7.  The Amcham representative highlighted the lack of </p><p>information in the private sector and civil society in </p><p>general regarding USCAFTA and remarked that Amcham has a </p><p>project underway to educate the public on the benefits of </p><p>free trade.  (Note:  The regional Amchams signed an </p><p>agreement with the Central American System for Economic </p><p>Integration (SIECA) on August 21 for approximately USD </p><p>65,000 to carry out a series of focus groups to identify </p><p>USCAFTA concerns and embark on a public relations campaign </p><p>to support the free trade talks.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p>8.  FIDE President Norman Garcia, who works closely with VP </p><p>Williams on Honduras\' participation in the Plan Puebla- </p><p>Panama (PPP) initiative and creation of the Competitiveness </p><p>Council, noted that the USCAFTA complements the </p><p>infrastructure projects contemplated in the PPP initiative. </p><p>Garcia stated that the PPP and USCAFTA are opportunities to </p><p>improve regional economic integration and investment climate </p><p>issues region-wide, to the benefit of foreign investors. </p><p>9.  Picking up on a key issue during A/S Reich\'s visit, VP </p><p>Williams highlighted the Maduro administration\'s efforts to </p><p>reform the judicial system and combat corruption.  VP </p><p>Williams singled out the implementation of the Criminal </p><p>Procedures Code and the new selection process for Supreme </p><p>Court Justices as significant achievements for the GOH.  He </p><p>also noted that the Maduro administration successfully </p><p>pushed through the Financial Stabilization Law, which </p><p>increases the tax base and includes tougher punitive </p><p>measures for tax evasion (like the temporary closure of </p><p>businesses), passed a law simplifying procedures to </p><p>incorporate a business and initiated a project that will </p><p>increase transparency in government procurement. </p><p> </p><p>10.  Atala echoed VP Williams\' points and added that the </p><p>GOH\'s tax collection efforts have resulted in a 20 percent </p><p>increase in tax revenues.  Atala, who was President Maduro\'s </p><p>point person on Temporary Protected Status (TPS), also noted </p><p>that remittances constitute a major source of revenue for </p><p>Honduras and have been increasing steadily over the last few </p><p>years.  (Note:  Minister of the Presidency Luis Cosenza told </p><p>the Ambassador recently that remittances increased by 38 </p><p>percent during the first six months of 2002 compared to the </p><p>first half of 2001.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p>11.  In response to Atala\'s inquiry concerning the Millenium </p><p>Challenge Fund, A/S Reich stated that Honduras was a good </p><p>candidate for the Fund and emphasized that in designating </p><p>the funds, the U.S. will evaluate a variety of factors, </p><p>including a country\'s human rights record, the extent of </p><p>investment in human capital and dedication to a free market </p><p>economy. </p><p> </p><p>12.  Post notes that the throughout the conversation the </p><p>Honduran public and private sector participants emphasized </p><p>the need to put in place the conditions necessary for </p><p>economic growth.  They were united in their commitment to </p><p>moving ahead on a Central American free trade agreement with </p><p>the U.S.  The Hondurans, as expected, made Nicaragua\'s 35 </p><p>percent tariff a major issue during the lunch.  Arguing that </p><p>it represents the biggest obstacle to further regional </p><p>economic integration and free trade talks, they pushed for </p><p>the U.S. to play an active role in resolving the divisive 35 </p><p>percent tariff. </p><p> </p><p>Almaguer </p><p></p></div>
