<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 KATHMANDU 001183 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>CA/OCS/ACS/NESA, DS/OP/NEA, DS/DSS/ITA AND </p><p>SA/INS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: CASC, PTER, ASEC, ECON, NP </p><p>SUBJECT:  Consular Visit Assesses Conditions Outside </p><p>Kathmandu Valley </p><p> </p><p>Refs: A) Kathmandu 209   B) Kathmandu 747  C) Kathmandu </p><p> </p><p>751 </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary.  Consul and Consular Assistant completed a </p><p>five-day road trip last week to assess concerns about </p><p>the safety of AmCit travel outside the Kathmandu Valley </p><p>given the continuing Maoist insurgency, surveying </p><p>primary travel routes and remote destinations frequented </p><p>by American citizens.  The consular team held two well- </p><p>attended warden meetings with AmCits living outside the </p><p>Valley, met with emergency service providers and </p><p>established contacts with key Government of Nepal (GON) </p><p>officials at the district level.  The Americans visited, </p><p>many of whom have been in Nepal\'s hinterlands for </p><p>several years, expressed deep gratitude for the meetings </p><p>and asked many security-related questions.  Some told of </p><p>encounters with Maoists, but none reported threats, </p><p>major incidents of harassment or anti-American sentiment </p><p>in those encounters.   The primary road travel danger </p><p>outside the Valley continues to be from busses and </p><p>freight trucks careening around the precarious curves of </p><p>Nepal\'s highways.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  The consular team\'s road trip covered 800 kms from </p><p>May 30 - June 3 with stops at the two most frequented </p><p>destinations for foreign travelers outside Kathmandu </p><p>Valley as well as a remote medical clinic staffed by </p><p>Americans and operated by INGO United Mission to Nepal. </p><p>In the process, the team drove through 12 of Nepal\'s 75 </p><p>districts.  Our Embassy plated vehicle was waved through </p><p>all but two of the numerous police and army check posts </p><p>along the route.  The only direct evidence of Maoist </p><p>violence encountered was the burned-out hulk of a </p><p>freight truck in Chaugidhar Village, Dhading District, </p><p>bombed by Maoists during April\'s bandh. </p><p> </p><p>POKHARA </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  The first stop was Pokhara, Nepal\'s second most </p><p>popular tourist destination (after Kathmandu Valley) and </p><p>entry point for the Annapurna trekking and climbing </p><p>routes.  Hoteliers, restauranteurs and merchants in this </p><p>usually bustling town bemoaned a grim tourist season. </p><p>Pokhara\'s 300 plus hotels were mostly empty. </p><p>Admittedly, we arrived after the end of the high tourist </p><p>season, but year-by-year comparisons indicate a dramatic </p><p>drop in Western visitors.  Aside from some Indian </p><p>tourists, our estimate (confirmed by the local AmCit </p><p>hotel owner who hosted our American citizens meeting) </p><p>was that less than 300 Westerners were visiting Pokhara </p><p>during our stay. </p><p> </p><p>4.  A lively wardens meeting, lasting over two hours, </p><p>was held in Pokhara on May 31.  Discussion of the Maoist </p><p>situation, the incidents underlying the May 16 Public </p><p>Announcement and Indo-Pak tensions dominated the meeting </p><p>attended by 19 Americans plus 2 European representatives </p><p>of INGOs with American volunteers.  Consul dispelled CNN </p><p>reports of a USG decision to "evacuate" all American </p><p>citizens throughout South Asia in the wake of the then </p><p>escalating Indo-Pak conflict and carefully discussed </p><p>procedures that might be taken in the event a worsening </p><p>security situation led to a decision to advise Americans </p><p>to depart Nepal.  We distributed a packet of information </p><p>with emergency contacts, emergency and crisis </p><p>procedures, Q&As about evacuation and suggested contents </p><p>for a "go kit". </p><p> </p><p>5.  One American NGO volunteer reported that Maoists </p><p>stopped him while riding his bicycle to work during the </p><p>last bandh and asked where he was going.  He was told he </p><p>could go to a friend\'s house, but that it was "not OK" </p><p>to go to his office.  After the meeting, several </p><p>individuals remarked that no official Embassy meeting </p><p>for Americans in Pokhara had been held for some time and </p><p>expressed thankfulness for the visit, especially in the </p><p>present difficult times. </p><p> </p><p>6.  While in Pokhara, the consular team held several </p><p>other very productive meetings, at hospitals, with the </p><p>Chief District Officer and with emergency service </p><p>providers.  Perhaps most important were our </p><p>consultations with the local managers of Karnali Air and </p><p>Fish Tail Air, who regularly assist us with emergency </p><p>helicopter rescues in the Annapurna region.  We learned </p><p>that helicopters must stop in Pokhara for refueling in </p><p>most evacuation scenarios to Kathmandu because they must </p><p>operate on minimum fuel to operate safely and land at </p><p>high altitudes, especially in high winds.  We also </p><p>learned that, due to recent crashes and the contracting </p><p>of one Dynasty Air helicopter for exclusive use by the </p><p>Armed Police in Nepalgunj, the "fleet" of available </p><p>commercial rescue helicopters for Nepal has been reduced </p><p>to 7.  Only Karnali Air will continue to pre-position a </p><p>helicopter in Pokhara.  Lack of demand in the Everest </p><p>region coupled with the decreased number of helicopters </p><p>nationwide means the helicopters that had been pre- </p><p>positioned in Lukla have been pulled -- and they are </p><p>unlikely to return for the fall tourist season. </p><p>Emergency medevacs of trekkers and climbers, operating </p><p>chiefly from Kathmandu, will now take longer.  [Note: </p><p>On the day of our meeting an Asian Airlines MI-17 </p><p>helicopter was lost en route from Mount Makalu to </p><p>Lukla.] </p><p> </p><p>United Mission to Nepal Visit </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>7. On June 1, the team proceeded over Syangya District\'s </p><p>torturous mountain roads to the Tansen Mission Hospital </p><p>operated by the inter-denominational INGO United Mission </p><p>to Nepal (UMN).  UMN\'s 240 expat staff (including 71 </p><p>Americans) manage hospitals, clinics, engineering and </p><p>development projects in remote locations throughout </p><p>Nepal.  The hospital in Tansen, UMN\'s largest, has </p><p>served Nepalis in this isolated region continuously for </p><p>more than 40 years, treating cases of Japanese </p><p>encephalitis, meningitis and diarrhea, as well as </p><p>surgeries, road accidents and maternity emergencies. </p><p>During our visit, the 190-bed hospital was over </p><p>capacity, with beds spread through the hallways. </p><p> </p><p>8.  We held an informal wardens meeting over dinner with </p><p>the 14 Americans (including family members) and one nun </p><p>who is a U.S. permanent resident, discussing the current </p><p>security situation and procedures in the event of an </p><p>emergency.  The Americans present felt concern about </p><p>their isolated location and the availability of </p><p>assistance in the event of an evacuation.  There is a </p><p>serviceable helipad adjacent to the hospital. One recent </p><p>American arrival brought a satellite telephone, and we </p><p>made arrangements for an emergency test upon our return. </p><p>As we heard in Pokhara, the Americans in Tansen reported </p><p>that Maoist-called general strikes (bandhs) are strictly </p><p>observed in their locale. </p><p> </p><p>9.  The group reported very good relations with the </p><p>local community, the accumulation of 40 years of good </p><p>will, and no Maoist threats.  However, two UMN clinics </p><p>in other locations did receive threats last year, one of </p><p>which had to be evacuated.  Maoists approached the </p><p>hospital director, an American who has served in Tansen </p><p>for 12 years, for "donations" once last fall.  He told </p><p>the Maoists that the hospital could not give money and </p><p>that the Maoists should go to individuals in the </p><p>community rather than the institution.  He was never </p><p>approached again.  He also stated that UMN\'s operations </p><p>in some other districts were being scaled back or </p><p>curtailed because of the security situation. </p><p> </p><p>Chitwan and Return </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>10.  Early the following morning, the consular tour </p><p>descended into the plains region (Terai) on Nepal\'s </p><p>southern border with India and stopped at the Royal </p><p>Chitwan National Park, one of the world\'s few remaining </p><p>habitats for tigers and other endangered species. </p><p>Chitwan District has experienced several sporadic </p><p>incidents of Maoist violence since hostilities renewed </p><p>in November.  Nightly charges at the top of the line </p><p>resort in Chitwan were $325 per night before the </p><p>dramatic tourist downturn.  Now, in attempts to increase </p><p>occupancy, its management is quietly approaching </p><p>residents and others with a "special" $75 rate, elephant </p><p>safari and naturalist walks included.  Even with the </p><p>incentives, lack of guests has caused that lodge and </p><p>most others in Chitwan Park to close prematurely for the </p><p>summer.  All but core maintenance staff are on forced, </p><p>unpaid leave until whenever it becomes cost effective to </p><p>reopen in the fall. </p><p> </p><p>11.  A useful meeting took place with Chitwan District\'s </p><p>acting Chief District Officer (CDO) in Bharatpur, Kamal </p><p>Kanta Regmi.  He offered to assist with any welfare and </p><p>whereabouts requests (we\'d had one supposedly lost group </p><p>of American university students in that district the </p><p>previous week).  Regmi also offered to take the </p><p>addresses of all Americans in Chitwan District and </p><p>"check-in" with them -- an offer we politely declined. </p><p>He stated that, although he cannot predict the future, </p><p>Maoist violence in Chitwan has thus far been directed </p><p>chiefly against individuals (as opposed to institutions </p><p>or government offices).  [Note: Reftels detail recent </p><p>Maoist attacks on Coca-Cola\'s plant Chitwan.]  In any </p><p>case, Mr. Regmi promised to provide all possible </p><p>assistance in any case involving American citizens. </p><p> </p><p>12  Road travel on Nepal circuitous, narrow highways is </p><p>treacherous and grueling.  Although we never covered </p><p>more than 200 kms on any day, every day\'s drive involved </p><p>a minimum of six hours.  Along the way, we witnessed the </p><p>aftermath of 20 major head-on collisions, more often </p><p>than not between busses and large carriage trucks. </p><p>Throughout the routes taken, the GON is installing large </p><p>squares of rocks encased with thick wire mesh (similar </p><p>to the landslide protection blocks) on the cliffside of </p><p>the highway as barriers to prevent vehicles from going </p><p>over the edge.  As we approached Kathmandu toward </p><p>nightfall on June 3, we witnessed numerous Westerners on </p><p>"night busses" headed toward Pokhara, despite explicit </p><p>warnings in Nepal\'s Consular Information Sheet. </p><p> </p><p>13. Conclusion: This consular tour assisted the </p><p>Embassy\'s efforts to monitor the security situation on </p><p>the main highways utilized by Western travelers to Nepal </p><p>and to apprise Americans living and working in two major </p><p>remote locations of the present security situation.  The </p><p>hundreds of Nepalis we encountered throughout the </p><p>journey welcomed us with the genuine warmth that </p><p>characterizes the people of this country, as we openly </p><p>spoke of ourselves as Americans and about America\'s </p><p>great friendship with Nepal.  The experience gained </p><p>during this visit to remote areas reinforces the </p><p>Embassy\'s evaluation that, barring a change in Maoist </p><p>tactics, responsible travel on the main tourist routes </p><p>outside the Kathmandu Valley does not pose any undue </p><p>security risk from terrorism or criminal violence. </p><p> </p><p>Malinowski </p><p></p></div>
