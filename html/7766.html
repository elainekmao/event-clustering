<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 000807 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/30/2013 </p><p>TAGS: CASC, ASEC, EPET, ENRG, ECON, PINS, PGOV, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: HOSTAGE CRISIS CONTINUES, MILITARY GETS </p><p>INVOLVED </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. JETER-LEDESMA MAY 1 TELCON </p><p>     B. ABUJA 806 </p><p>     C. ABUJA 768 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter for reason </p><p>1.5 (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p>1. (C) Transocean Sedco Forex officials confirm that striking </p><p>oil workers still hold 273 hostages--including 17 U.S. </p><p>citizens and 79 other expatriates--on four rigs off Port </p><p>Harcourt. The company\'s Managing Director Ian Clark says the </p><p>platforms have been re-supplied with sufficient quantities of </p><p>food and water, but admits there have been threats of </p><p>physical violence directed at the hostages. However, he </p><p>states that the hostages continue to be in good health and do </p><p>not appear to be in immediate danger. Nigerian naval vessels </p><p>have anchored in the vicinity of the rigs--the Navy\'s purpose </p><p>is to deliver the court injunction requiring that the </p><p>strikers depart. Sources indicate that the military has no </p><p>imminent plans to use force to deliver the injunction. </p><p>Meanwhile, negotiations between the workers and company </p><p>officials, mediated by NUPENG, are stalled. In a separate </p><p>incident, the Nigerian Navy freed workers on a Shell rig </p><p>taken over by Ijaw youths. There were no reported injuries </p><p>and the youths have been taken into custody. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Supplies Replenished, Threats of Violence Confirmed </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>2. (U) Clark told Econoff on May 1 that food and water </p><p>supplies had been running low, but that additional supplies </p><p>were offloaded by crane from a supply vessel. None of the </p><p>supply vessel personnel boarded the rig. He also explained </p><p>that during the episode, tempers had flared intermittently on </p><p>the rig and some irate workers had indeed threatened the </p><p>hostages with bodily harm; however, he said again that he </p><p>felt the hostages were in no immediate danger. Clark told the </p><p>Ambassador that these threats were not reoccurring and had </p><p>been particularly directed at two rig managers in an effort </p><p>to put pressure on Transocean Sedco Forex management to give </p><p>in. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Clark said the 25 or so striking oil workers on each </p><p>rig have been able to prevent the hostages from leaving by </p><p>blocking the helipads. There are lifeboats sufficient to </p><p>ferry everyone off the rigs, but it would be difficult to </p><p>safely use them unless everyone agreed to leave the rigs. </p><p>Striking workers could easily prevent access to the boats or </p><p>make using them a dangerous proposition. Although the </p><p>striking workers are outnumbered, the hostages would also be </p><p>putting themselves in danger by attempting to subdue their </p><p>captors, Clark added. He emphasized the need for a peaceful </p><p>settlement. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Clark explained that the letter he had written the </p><p>Rivers State Police Commissioner was factual but </p><p>intentionally alarmist in tone to get the immediate attention </p><p>of the police. (Note: A copy of the letter was faxed April 30 </p><p>to AF/W. Ref B, Paragraph 2 also mentions the letter. End </p><p>Note) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Nigerian Military Gets Involved </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>5. (C) The President\'s Special Advisor on Foreign Affairs </p><p>Ad\'obe Obe told the Ambassador May 1 that Obasanjo viewed the </p><p>crisis seriously and had convened an April 30 security </p><p>meeting with top civilian and military advisors to look for </p><p>solutions. He said that they had agreed to send naval vessels </p><p>to the area in order to deliver the Federal High Court </p><p>injunction requiring an end to the wildcat strike. Obe </p><p>emphasized that there were no plans to use force to deliver </p><p>the injunctions or remove the striking oil workers. A GON </p><p>military source confirmed that naval vessels are now anchored </p><p>in the vicinity of the platforms. The source indicates that </p><p>there is no specific timeline for delivery of the injunction </p><p>and that there are no plans to use force. (Note: These </p><p>vessels may be the two buoy tenders the USG donated to the </p><p>GON earlier this year. These vessels were already being </p><p>deployed in that general area to discourage a local community </p><p>from following through on plans to sabotage a separate Shell </p><p>rig. Post is attempting to confirm whether the buoy tenders </p><p>are the vessels anchored near the rigs. End Note.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) General Sylvester, Chief of Staff and second in </p><p>command at EUCOM, spoke with Nigerian Chief of Defense </p><p>Admiral Oghohi to express his concern with the situation and </p><p>request that force not be used to solve it. Oghohi said there </p><p>were no imminent plans to carry out any military mission (Ref </p><p>A). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Negotiations Stalled </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>7. (U) NUPENG officials continue to disavow the strike but </p><p>are serving as intermediaries for negotiations. Clark and </p><p>other Transocean Sedco Forex officials report that </p><p>negotiations in Lagos on May 30 with NUPENG officials had </p><p>resulted in agreement that dismissal of the five workers who </p><p>instigated the situation was justified and would stick. </p><p>However, NUPENG is balking at the company\'s demand that all </p><p>workers involved in the hostage-taking also be dismissed. </p><p>Company officials say negotiations will resume May 2. </p><p>Meanwhile, Clark reports that National Labour Congress </p><p>President Oshiomole is working behind the scenes to encourage </p><p>a negotiated solution. The Ambassador was in touch with </p><p>Oshiomole yesterday and he promised that he would engage on </p><p>the issue, including with top NUPENG executives. Post plans </p><p>to follow up with Oshiomole on May 2. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Clark said NUPENG might be willing to take a more </p><p>active role in resolving the situation if pressured from the </p><p>GON. In particular, he suggested a forceful letter from </p><p>Minister of Labor and Productivity Musa Gwadabe to the NUPENG </p><p>leadership might produce the necessary fillip. The Ambassador </p><p>and the ranking British High Commission official plan to see </p><p>the Minister to recommend this course of action. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A Busy Week in the Delta </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>9. (U) Local press reported May 1 the peaceful end to a </p><p>hostage-taking on a Chevron rig off the Bayelsa State coast. </p><p>According to the press report, Chevron\'s off-shore platform </p><p>was taken over earlier this week by Ijaw youths who held </p><p>hostage the local and expatriate Chevron staff working on the </p><p>platform until the Navy yesterday rescued the staff and </p><p>arrested the youth. The press report claimed the youth took </p><p>over the platform because they were owed money by Chevron. </p><p>The report also claimed that the takeover and subsequent shut </p><p>down of two additional nearby platforms led to the loss of </p><p>100,000 barrels of crude oil production per day. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) Chevron-Texaco General Manager for Public and </p><p>Governmental Relations Sola Omole confirmed the basic details </p><p>of this account. He noted that the platform takeover was </p><p>brief and ended peacefully.  Omole claims the Ijaw youth were </p><p>not armed and were "home guards" paid by Chevron who for </p><p>unexplained reasons had not received their remuneration for </p><p>the past three months. (Comment: Chevron-Texaco, like other </p><p>companies, often pays idle youth to serve as "home guards" </p><p>protecting the company\'s facilities in the area. This is </p><p>little more than payoff to youths who threaten oil company </p><p>installations with sabotage. End Comment.) Omole denied that </p><p>any significant oil production was lost as the result of this </p><p>take-over, noting that only 27,000 barrels per day is </p><p>produced from this area. Omole confirmed that the Navy </p><p>effected the rescue and had taken the Ijaw youths into </p><p>custody. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
