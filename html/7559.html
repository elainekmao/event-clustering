<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 AMMAN 002367 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/17/2013 </p><p>TAGS: EPET, ETRD, ENRG, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZ01: JORDAN\'S ENERGY MINISTER ON OIL SITUATION, </p><p>GAS FUTURES </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edward W. Gnehm, reasons 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (c)  Summary:  Jordanian Energy Minister Mohammed </p><p>Bataineh told us April 17 that after a slow start, Gulf oil </p><p>was now flowing into Jordan to replace Iraqi crude. </p><p>Jordanian reserves had dipped initially when Iraqi oil </p><p>stopped flowing, but had since stabilized and were expected </p><p>to replenish soon.  This new system, though, is causing </p><p>significant financial and environmental disruptions in </p><p>Jordan.  While the GOJ is making plans to accommodate the new </p><p>reality of market prices for crude in the future, it will </p><p>feel sharp fiscal pain in the short term as it makes the </p><p>adjustment.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>Gulf Oil Deal Update </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (c)  Bataineh praised the flexibility and reliability of </p><p>his Saudi interlocutors, noting that they had not only come </p><p>through as promised with a three-month deal to provide 50,000 </p><p>bpd, but had also agreed to restructure the delivery schedule </p><p>from three to two shipments at the GOJ\'s request.  Bataineh </p><p>said one ship had already lifted one million barrels of crude </p><p>from Yanbu and had arrived at Aqaba.  It had not yet begun </p><p>offloading.  The 3-month deal, he said, was formally an </p><p>agreement between ARAMCO and the Jordan Petroleum Refinery </p><p>Company (JPRC), not/not a government-to-government deal.  He </p><p>added that this arrangement was made at ARAMCO\'s request. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (c)  Bataineh was somewhat frustrated with his Kuwaiti </p><p>colleagues, however.  He said Kuwaiti oil and port </p><p>authorities had raised objections about the ship the GOJ had </p><p>chartered to transport the oil, refusing it entry into the </p><p>loading site on the grounds that it did not meet safety </p><p>standards (Bataineh admitted it was an older, single-hulled </p><p>vessel).  He said the Kuwaitis were less flexible about </p><p>consolidating shipments, meaning the GOJ would have to make </p><p>additional trips and lease the ship for longer in order to </p><p>collect the oil, which resulted in significant additional </p><p>costs (see below).  The Kuwaitis ultimately agreed to a </p><p>ship-to-ship transfer of 240,000 tons of crude, which </p><p>Bataineh said was currently being effected, after which the </p><p>leased ship would head to Aqaba. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (c)  As for the Emirates\' promise of a cash grant to </p><p>cover purchase of 25,000 bpd, Bataineh said this matter was </p><p>being handled directly by the Finance Ministry.  He had no </p><p>knowledge as to whether or not any grants had been received. </p><p>Bataineh also denied reports that Jordan had lifted oil from </p><p>Ras Tanura.  He said the site had been proposed as a lifting </p><p>option, but that they and the Saudis had decided instead to </p><p>lift from Yanbu which is much closer, and hence less costly. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>Reserves Down, but Stabilizing </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5.  (c)  Bataineh said land-based as well as shipboard </p><p>reserves were down significantly over the past month.  Crude </p><p>reserves in Zarqa are down to 95,000 tons from a pre-war peak </p><p>of 200,000 tons, and reserves on the tanker "Jerash," moored </p><p>in Aqaba, were down to 140,000 from 280,000.  (Note: </p><p>Bataineh told us in a previous meeting that all land reserves </p><p>were refined product, and all crude storage was shipboard. </p><p>End note.)  Bataineh attributed the dip in reserves to the </p><p>need to offset the loss of crude flows from Iraq when the war </p><p>started.  He said reserves are now stable at the new, lower </p><p>level.  He added that, with the arrival of the feeder from </p><p>Yanbu, reserves should "top up" again to their previous </p><p>levels "in a few weeks," and noted there are an additional </p><p>30,000 tons of crude storage in Aqaba currently. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>Financial, Opportunity Costs </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (c)  Bataineh asserted that the new system was resulting </p><p>in significant financial and other costs.  While exact </p><p>figures are unavailable for the total additional cost to the </p><p>GOJ of the current system, Bataineh provided many </p><p>illustrative examples:  rental of the two feeder ships was </p><p>costing the GOJ $25,000 and $85,000 per day respectively just </p><p>in rental fees.  Bataineh complained that these fees were </p><p>assessed monthly, even though the ships were only making one </p><p>or two trips.  The ships incurred additional costs at port. </p><p>When lifting, the ships are assessed a $1.50/ton fee, and </p><p>once they reach Aqaba, they incur significant additional </p><p>costs as they maneuver in and out of the sole oil jetty - </p><p>which is also used to offload vegetable oil, refined product, </p><p>and sulpho-chemicals. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (c)  Land transport fees were actually cheaper under the </p><p>new system ($9.10/ton versus $14.50/ton when trucked from </p><p>Iraq), but trucks cannot be fully loaded (for the reason </p><p>given below) and as a result have to make additional trips. </p><p>Thus land transport costs are likely a wash.  More </p><p>concerning, though, is the significant damage being done to </p><p>the just-completed bypass road that curls behind Aqaba to </p><p>link with the Desert Highway.  Bataineh showed us pictures of </p><p>significant damage to the road and the surrounding </p><p>environment from large amounts of spilled oil.  According to </p><p>Bataineh, the grade of the road is exceptionally steep, and </p><p>Jordan\'s crude trucking fleet is exceptionally old.  This </p><p>combination has resulted in large amounts of spillage of </p><p>crude onto the road and into the countryside.  To counter </p><p>this, the trucks are now traveling with only partial loads. </p><p>However, since the road was designed essentially for cargo </p><p>traffic and not tanker traffic, the axle load on the road </p><p>from the crude trucks far exceeds the maximum allowable. </p><p>This is further destroying the new road. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>The Future is Gas </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (c)  Bataineh said the cabinet was concerned about </p><p>Jordan\'s energy future, in particular what would happen in </p><p>three months when the Gulf concessions ran out.  He said it </p><p>was inevitable that Jordan would be paying market prices for </p><p>crude, but noted this would have serious budgetary </p><p>consequences.  He said the cabinet is still discussing price </p><p>hikes for refined product, but said it is a highly-charged </p><p>issue, because of the social and political costs of such a </p><p>move. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (c)  On the bright side, he said, a number of natural </p><p>gas-related projects were on schedule and would help limit </p><p>Jordan\'s crude dependency.  He noted that the undersea </p><p>portion of the Egypt-Jordan gas pipeline was complete, and </p><p>that documentation was nearly finalized to extend the </p><p>pipeline to Amman.  He expected the remaining land </p><p>connections and receiving stations to be completed in the </p><p>coming weeks, and said gas should be flowing by mid-June. </p><p>Once the turbines at the Aqaba power station started using </p><p>gas (they are already installed and ready to go), Jordan\'s </p><p>fuel oil needs would be cut by about 60%. </p><p> </p><p>10. (c)  Bataineh said the Al Samra Independent Power Project </p><p>(IPP) was still in train, but said progress had stalled with </p><p>the departure of Tractebel, the original contractor. </p><p>Bataineh said the GOJ was taking new bids on the </p><p>combined-cycle plant, and had received serious interest from </p><p>a number of energy companies.  However, most of the bidders </p><p>proposed greenfield projects, which would take too long to </p><p>build to meet Jordan\'s medium-term energy needs.  Bataineh </p><p>predicted the IPP needed to be on-line by 2006 to meet </p><p>Jordan\'s future electricity needs, and was asking bidders for </p><p>new proposals that could build on the work already completed </p><p>by Tractebel. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>Happiness is Multiple Pipelines </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (c)  Looking even further ahead, Bataineh said Jordan </p><p>would likely have to look to re-establish an oil relationship </p><p>with a new Iraqi government in order to meet its energy needs </p><p>in the most cost-efficient way.  Bataineh did not suggest </p><p>that new oil concessions were in the cards, but looked rather </p><p>to oil sector investment as a means to renew the relationship </p><p>to mutual advantage.  He said first that the Iraq-Zarqa </p><p>pipeline was still on the books, and that the GOJ was eager </p><p>to see a new Iraqi government in place that could meet its </p><p>commitments under the terms of the deal (which includes, </p><p>inter alia, delivery of loading stations by the developer to </p><p>Iraqi government control). </p><p> </p><p>12.  (c)  In addition, he said he had received a number of </p><p>expressions of interest from developers looking to revitalize </p><p>an idea from the mid-1980\'s to run a crude pipeline from Iraq </p><p>to Aqaba, and to build additional refineries in Aqaba.  Such </p><p>a plan, he said, would bring Jordan revenue from transit fees </p><p>and would reduce transportation costs for oil used </p><p>domestically.  He denied flat out, however, that there was </p><p>any plan or discussion to restart a Mosul-Haifa crude </p><p>pipeline as reported in the press.  Any such talk, he said, </p><p>was ridiculous, since the pipeline no longer exists as such. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  (c)  The war has clearly brought additional costs to </p><p>Jordan\'s energy sector.  While those costs are not yet easily </p><p>quantifiable, they are apparent, from the significant damage </p><p>to Aqaba\'s new bypass highway to the fees associated with </p><p>feeder ships, to say nothing of the looming elimination of </p><p>subsidies on crude imports.  Bataineh\'s plans for the </p><p>sector\'s future appear sound, if somewhat ambitious.  But if </p><p>successfully completed, they would ease somewhat the burden </p><p>of shifting to market prices for crude.  In the short term, </p><p>though, and especially after Gulf concessions cease in three </p><p>months, Jordan will face serious financial strains from the </p><p>cessation of its sweetheart oil arrangement with the Saddam </p><p>regime. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
