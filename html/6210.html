<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABU DHABI 001100 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARP AND NEA/RA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL:03/08/13 </p><p>TAGS: ENRG, PGOV, ETRD, OM, TC </p><p>SUBJECT: ABU DHABI ALUMINUM SMELTING PROJECT FOR OMAN </p><p>REVEALS CONTINUING STRATEGIC VISION OF THE UAE OFFSETS GROUP </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba for </p><p>reasons 1.5 (b and d). </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The UAE Offsets Group (UOG) has under the aegis of de </p><p>facto Defense Minister Muhammad bin Zayid Al-Nahyan (MBZ) </p><p>become Abu Dhabi Emirate\'s strategic business development </p><p>platform, responsible for many innovative projects serving </p><p>both practical and broader strategic objectives.  UOG\'s </p><p>best-known venture, the ongoing Dolphin Project to pipe </p><p>natural gas from Qatar to Abu Dhabi, was as much about </p><p>achieving political reconciliation between the estranged Al- </p><p>Nayhan and Al-Thani (hurt feelings derived from President </p><p>Zayid giving refuge to the deposed father of the current </p><p>Qatari Amir) as it was about meeting the UAE\'s burgeoning </p><p>demand for gas.  Similarly, UOG\'s project to build a 200 </p><p>million cubic feet per day desalination plant in Fujairah </p><p>Emirate (with the water to be pumped to Al-Ain in Abu Dhabi </p><p>Emirate), was at first about Abu Dhabi rewarding the well- </p><p>regarded leadership of Fujairah with a multi-billion dollar </p><p>project.  That vision has now expanded to encompass a major </p><p>power component at the plant, which will be used to run a </p><p>projected two billion USD aluminum smelter at Sohar in </p><p>neighboring Oman. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  The head of the New Ventures Unit at UOG, Khaldun </p><p>Al-Mubarak, told Econchief and Econoff March 3 that Offsets, </p><p>after having "created value" by envisioning how such a </p><p>cross-border joint venture could have both economic and </p><p>political benefits for Abu Dhabi, has now turned the </p><p>aluminum smelter project over to ADWEA -- the Abu Dhabi </p><p>Water and Electricity Authority.  ADWEA will work with the </p><p>Omani authorities and the private sector (including Aluminum </p><p>Canada - ALCAN) to move forward with the project, which </p><p>should produce significant revenue and, more importantly for </p><p>Oman, jobs.  Asked by Econchief how the Dubai Aluminum </p><p>smelter firm, Dubal, had reacted to the creation of such a </p><p>near-by competitor, Al-Mubarak observed that the Dubai </p><p>authorities were not pleased, but had no reason to complain </p><p>as they had been offered a chance to participate in the </p><p>Sohar project but had declined, claiming that they would </p><p>only join in the venture if it were located in Dubai </p><p>Emirate.  "Perhaps they thought we would not proceed without </p><p>them," the UOG official stated, "but they were wrong." </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Comment:  The UAE, as part of its resolution of a </p><p>long-running border dispute with Oman last summer, committed </p><p>to significant cross-border investment (although the details </p><p>that were shared with us focused more on tourism and road </p><p>development along the coast between Muscat and Sur).  The </p><p>Fujairah desal plant, which began life as a means to water </p><p>the extensive Al-Ain farms and gardens of the Abu Dhabi </p><p>shaykhs, has now morphed -- in a move that is vintage UOG -- </p><p>to reflect that broader strategic vision.  Perhaps equally </p><p>interesting is the success with which MBZ has used UOG to </p><p>bring into his ambit two of his half-brothers, ADWEA\'s </p><p>Shaykh Dhiyab (whose mother is from the well-connected Al- </p><p>Darmaki tribe and whose full brothers include Amiri Guard </p><p>Chief Nahyan and Abu Dhabi Seaport head Said) as well as </p><p>Hamed -- who as the head of Union Water and Electricity </p><p>Company (UWEC) is overseeing the construction of the </p><p>Fujairah plant.  Hamed also serves as head of the Abu Dhabi </p><p>Economic Department, with which UOG is working to create a </p><p>development plan for Abu Dhabi\'s Musafah industrial zone. </p><p>Hamed\'s full brothers include the the de facto Interior </p><p>Minister, Shaykh Saif, and Ahmed, who heads the Abu Dhabi </p><p>Investment Authority, responsible for managing the </p><p>government\'s huge overseas investments.  It is also worth </p><p>noting that UOG -- as an Abu Dhabi Emirate institution -- </p><p>sought participation in the Sohar project from Dubal, but </p><p>clearly believed that proceeding to cement ties with Oman </p><p>even without such involvement was worth whatever ill </p><p>feelings such action might engender in Dubai. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
