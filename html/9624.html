<p>UNCLAS  ROME 003360 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, PREL, PGOV, MOPS, IT, EUN </p><p>SUBJECT: ITALY\'S EU PRESIDENCY: U.S./EU TASK FORCE </p><p>DISCUSSIONS </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) U.S., Commission and Council officials and </p><p>representatives of the Italian EU Presidency discussed a wide </p><p>range of subjects, from the U.S. Passenger Name Record and </p><p>Container Security Initiatives to Europe\'s efforts to assist </p><p>Africa, at the July 18th U.S./EU task force meeting in Rome. </p><p> </p><p>Task Force Participants </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>U.S. </p><p>---- </p><p>Chuck English, Director, Office of European Affairs, State </p><p>Department </p><p>Scott Kilner, Minister Counselor for Economic Affairs, U.S. </p><p>Embassy Rome </p><p>Steve Cristina, Economic Counselor, U.S. Mission to the </p><p>European Union </p><p>Marja Verloop, EU Desk Officer, State Department </p><p>Kathleen Doherty, Economic Officer, U.S. Embassy Rome </p><p>(notetaker) </p><p> </p><p>Italian Presidency </p><p>------------------ </p><p>Sandro De Bernardin, Task Force Coordinator, Ministry of </p><p>Foreign Affairs </p><p>Massimo Gaiani, Director, EU external relations division, MFA </p><p>Andrea Sama, EU External Relations division, MFA </p><p> </p><p>Council Secretariat </p><p>------------------- </p><p>Jim Cloos </p><p>Massimo Parnisari </p><p>European Commission </p><p>------------------- </p><p>Percy Westerlund </p><p>Luc Veron </p><p>Luisa Ragher </p><p>David Tirr </p><p>Philippe Coessens (EU Delegation in Washington) </p><p> </p><p>Passenger Name Record (PNR) </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Commission officials argued that the March </p><p>U.S/Commission interim agreement was legally frail and, as </p><p>such, was severely attacked by the European Parliament and </p><p>Data Privacy Authorities (Article 29 Committee members). </p><p>Although acknowledging that the U.S., in a good-faith effort, </p><p>has taken several steps to address Commission and member </p><p>states\' concerns, the U.S. must do more, Commission officials </p><p>remarked.  Key EU demands were highlighted in Bolkestein\'s </p><p>June 16 letter to Secretary Ridge.  They included a </p><p>limitation of USG use of PNR data to counter-terrorism, but </p><p>not law enforcement; deletion of all PNR data defined as </p><p>sensitive by EU Law once Customs and Border Police (CBP) and </p><p>the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) receive it; </p><p>provision of a system of passenger redress to an independent, </p><p>non-USG body. Commission officials reiterated what </p><p>Commissioner Patten recently told DHS Deputy Secretary Gordon </p><p>England: agreement on PNR must be reached by end of July to </p><p>avoid negative adequacy findings in September. The Italian </p><p>Presidency underscored the political importance of this </p><p>issue, domestically within EU member states and for all of </p><p>the EU.  It is a question of compatibility of security </p><p>demands with national laws and civil liberties, GOI officials </p><p>contended. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) English acknowledged that the talks between DepSec </p><p>England and Patten revealed that fundamental differences </p><p>still remain.  Addressing Bolkestein\'s questions, the U.S. is </p><p>hopeful that there might be a way forward on the limitation </p><p>of scope question.  The EU has proposed a scope of "terrorism </p><p>and related crimes;" the U.S.\' wording is terrorism and </p><p>serious offenses.  U.S. Customs, by its charter as a law </p><p>enforcement agency, can not ignore serious felonies such as </p><p>murder and drug smuggling, English stated.  On sensitive </p><p>data, the U.S. has moved much closer to the EU position and </p><p>hopes fields for immediate deletion can be identified. </p><p>Commission officials concurred. On the independent review </p><p>question, the U.S. side pointed out that Nuala Kelly, Chief </p><p>Privacy Officer, Department of Homeland Security, has an </p><p>independent role and reports directly to both Secretary Ridge </p><p>and to Congress, depending on the issue. Regarding Kelly, </p><p>Commission officials questioned whether she is sufficiently </p><p>independent within DHS and queried whether her independence </p><p>can be strengthened and better defined. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) A glaring omission in the discussion of PNR, </p><p>remarked English, is the law enforcement perspective (Justice </p><p>and Home Affairs - JHA).  For the U.S., PNR is a question of </p><p>security and we would welcome the JHA point of view. </p><p>Commissions officials underscored that they are aware of the </p><p>purpose of PNR and see the value of the JHA perspective, but </p><p>it no way should this be used to circumvent data protection </p><p>issues. </p><p> </p><p>Container Security Initiative </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) English noted that much progress has been made on </p><p>reaching an agreement on CSI. He expressed hope that we can </p><p>close an agreement with the Commission that would capture the </p><p>spirit of the existing "Declarations of Principle" with EU </p><p>member states and would allow us to move forward in a </p><p>constructive manner.  English also said that it was the U.S. </p><p>understanding that the infringement proceedings that the </p><p>Commission had begun against the member states for the DOPs </p><p>would be lifted on signature of the Joint Decision. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Westerlund responded that the Commission could not </p><p>discuss or negotiate the lifting of the infringements. "We </p><p>need a legally binding agreement," he added, "That is why the </p><p>nature of the decision to be taken by the U.S.-EU Joint </p><p>Customs Committee is so important. He noted that Commissioner </p><p>Patten had raised this with DHS Deputy Secretary England -- </p><p>who seemed to confirm that it would be legally binding. </p><p>Westerlund suggested that we might need to follow up on this </p><p>at the operational level. </p><p> </p><p>EC Enhanced Status at UNHCR Executive Committee </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) Making a strong pitch for the U.S. to support the </p><p>EC\'s request for enhanced status in the UNHCR\'s EXCOM, </p><p>Commission officials argued that the EC is a major </p><p>stakeholder in UNHCR in terms of asylum issues and is a major </p><p>donor itself.  Officials also pointed out that the EC is a </p><p>full participant or has enhanced observer status in most </p><p>major fora and in UN Committees.  Member states have granted </p><p>the Deputy High Commissioner a mandate to negotiate for </p><p>enhanced status in the UNHCR EXCOM. The Italian Presidency </p><p>argued that all Member States are behind the Commission\'s </p><p>request and do not want a confrontation with the U.S. or the </p><p>UN on this issue. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) In response, the U.S. delegation said that the </p><p>principle of no additionality must be upheld, and that U.S. </p><p>policy is not to grant the EU/EC, when it is an observer, </p><p>special status equivalent to those of a party. </p><p> </p><p>Bio-Terrorism Act </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) Luc Veron said that the EU shares U.S. concerns and </p><p>ideas for improving traceability and security in the food </p><p>chain, but continues to have grave concerns about the </p><p>obligations imposed under the U.S. Bioterrorism Act of 2002. </p><p>Member States have rigorous inspection and safety guidelines </p><p>and there should be some recognition of and acceptance of </p><p>these standards and practices.  The Commission also stated </p><p>that application of the obligations on food imports to the </p><p>U.S. should not be more onerous that those imposed on </p><p>domestic products.  The Commission hopes that we can work </p><p>together to minimize the effects on trade.  Before the U.S. </p><p>finalizes the implementing regulation, the Commission hopes </p><p>to have further consultations with the U.S. The Italian </p><p>Presidency emphasized that the principle of no-duplication </p><p>should be respected as much as possible and that the possible </p><p>long-term negative effects on trade are clearly understood. </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) English said that the FDA has tried to ensure that </p><p>it takes into account whenever possible EC comments and </p><p>concerns while developing the implementing regulation, the </p><p>U.S. delegation commented. The U.S. understands that the </p><p>rules should be as least burdensome as possible, with the </p><p>least impact on trade and as non-discriminatory as possible </p><p>with regards to our trading partners. In a final comment, DG </p><p>Trade Official De Laet said for the record, that the law </p><p>itself -- not just the proposed implementation rules -- is </p><p>restrictive on trade. He urged that we not only take every </p><p>opportunity to improve the implementation but that we also </p><p>use any flexibility built into the law itself to ensure </p><p>minimal effects on trade. </p><p> </p><p>Africa </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------ </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU) Commission and Presidency officials summarized the </p><p>key aspects of the meeting of the EU Troika with Africa </p><p>leaders, which took place on July 11 in Maputo, Mozambique. </p><p>The key purpose of this meeting was to keep the EU\'s </p><p>political dialog with Africa open, since the Zimbabwe </p><p>question precluded the holding of an EU/Africa Summit.  In </p><p>Maputo, European and African leaders discussed prospects for </p><p>an active partnership on security and conflict resolution. </p><p>On the latter point, the Commission intends to set up a peace </p><p>facilitation structure. This facility will be designed to </p><p>assist and finance African peacekeeping operations by </p><p>Africans. Also discussed were Africa\'s external debt burden, </p><p>and the WTO trade round, especially on how it addresses </p><p>capacity building in developing countries. </p><p> </p><p>12. (SBU) The Commission also briefed on the situation in the </p><p>Democratic Republic of the Congo and of High Rep Solana\'s </p><p>visit to the Great Lakes region. They expressed appreciation </p><p>for U.S. support for MONUC force expansion and a UNSC Chapter </p><p>7 resolution.  Regarding the turnover of supplies by the </p><p>"Artemis" force to MONUC, they said they are concerned about </p><p>the transition to the Bangladeshis, since there will be no </p><p>French-speaking contingent in Ituri. Regarding the political </p><p>process in the Congo, Solana was encouraged that the impasse </p><p>is close to being unblocked. When queried by the U.S. whether </p><p>Solana and the EC believe that the warlords will lay down </p><p>their arms and participate in the political process, the </p><p>Council Secretariat official Jim Cloos replied that the </p><p>Congolese are determined to move forward and that there is an </p><p>opening for a peaceful solution. The question of arms will </p><p>have to be looked at carefully, according to Cloos. The EU is </p><p>in favor of some type of arms embargo, but this is a </p><p>complicated issue. </p><p> </p><p>13. (SBU) Solana emphasized in his talks in Africa and before </p><p>the UN that the EU military mission must be terminated by </p><p>September 1.  Its sole intent is to bridge the peace and </p><p>allow for the start of the political process. Since this is </p><p>the first mission outside of Europe, the terms under which it </p><p>was agreed to do so must be respected, Secretariat and </p><p>Commission officials emphasized. </p><p> </p><p>14. (SBU) Regarding President Bush\'s recent visit to Africa, </p><p>the U.S. side said no decision has yet been made to put "U.S. </p><p>boots on the ground" or instead, provide support to ECOWAS. </p><p>On HIV/AIDs, Cloos from the Secretariat queried whether the </p><p>US pledge of 15 billion is real, since the 2004 draft federal </p><p>budget does not have sufficient funds to support this </p><p>commitment. U.S. delegates underscored the President\'s </p><p>commitment, noting the Congressional requirement that the US </p><p>contribute no more than one third of the contributions to the </p><p>Global Fund. The delegation remarked that the President </p><p>himself told Commissioner Prodi that he, as the Chief </p><p>Executive, will ensure that the full pledge of USD 15 billion </p><p>is spent over the next five years, either through the Global </p><p>Fund for HIV/AIDs or through bilateral programs. </p><p> </p><p>Bilateral Investment Treaties </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>15. (SBU) The U.S. delegation expressed its hope that the </p><p>College of European Commissioners will approve the political </p><p>understanding negotiated with DG Trade on bilateral </p><p>investment treaties.  Commission officials said that one </p><p>possible "tripping stone" remains - the issue of whether the </p><p>Commission would continue to have the authority to impose </p><p>restrictions on capital movements. Although the prospect of </p><p>the EU resorting to such restrictions is remote, Commission </p><p>officials noted, they still might need a flexible approach. </p><p> </p><p>Aviation Agreement </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>16. (SBU) U.S. and Commission officials lauded the agreement </p><p>that gives the EC the mandate to negotiate a comprehensive </p><p>air services agreement with the United States.  English </p><p>underscored the U.S. interest in an early harvest agreement </p><p>that would be followed by further negotiation on more </p><p>difficult issues, particularly those that would require </p><p>statutory changes.  Regarding early harvest, the Commission </p><p>said it is ready to listen to U.S. proposals but the EC also </p><p>is committed to a full agreement.  The latter is the only way </p><p>to achieve real economic benefits in aviation.  Veron said </p><p>the first plenary will be the week of October 1 in Washington </p><p>followed by a second session the week of December 8 in </p><p>Brussels. He added that Commissioner de Palacio and Secretary </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Mineta may meet some time after the second session and before </p><p>the end of the year to take stock of progress to date. </p><p> </p><p>Positive Economic Agenda (PEA) </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>17. (SBU) Veron noted the good results that have been </p><p>achieved: the U.S./EU financial services market dialogue; </p><p>Spanish clementines; U.S./EU cooperation on regulatory </p><p>reform; the pending mutual recognition agreement on marine </p><p>equipment well as exploratory talks on trade of organic </p><p>products. He said that he hoped the Commission could go into </p><p>more detail with USTR on July 29 on ideas to expand the PEA. </p><p> English said the U.S. shared this positive assessment and </p><p>hopes that we can strive for solutions on poultry and solving </p><p>the remaining questions.  All sides agreed that we need to </p><p>work together to meet the broader challenges facing </p><p>transatlantic and international businesses. </p><p> </p><p>World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>18. (SBU) Commission and Presidency officials see the WSIS as </p><p>an opportunity for political leaders to express confidence in </p><p>using information technology for economic development and </p><p>growth and to share EU experience in e-strategies.  The </p><p>Commission is concerned about the slow progress in the </p><p>preparatory stages for the Summit, especially in bridging the </p><p>gap between the developed and developing countries on these </p><p>issues.  The Commission views the September 12th Information </p><p>Society Dialogue in Washington as an opportunity to advance </p><p>before the third prepcom meeting. The U.S. also expressed </p><p>concern about some of the proposals offered by developing </p><p>countries on such issues as intellectual property rights. </p><p>Task Force participants agreed on the need to work closely </p><p>together to find common ground. Regarding the level of </p><p>participation, Commission officials said European </p><p>Commissioner for Enterprise and Information Society, Erkki </p><p>Liikanen will definitely attend; President Prodi also is </p><p>likely. </p><p> </p><p>U.S./EU Summit Follow-Up: Hydrogen, Non-Pro </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>19. (SBU) U.S. delegates noted that the U.S. will convene in </p><p>November. (The IPHE roll out is planned for November 19-21) a </p><p>high-level meeting to inaugurate the International </p><p>Partnership for the Hydrogen Economy (IPHE) and are pleased </p><p>that the Commission will participate.  In advance of the </p><p>meeting, the U.S. will circulate a draft terms of reference </p><p>and welcomes the Commission\'s comments.  Commission officials </p><p>said they are reviewing U.S. proposals for the IPHE </p><p>partnership, and will pay particular attention to ensuring </p><p>that the terms of reference are consistent with EC and member </p><p>state guidelines. On another Summit issue, non-proliferation, </p><p>the U.S. encouraged a joint plan for areas where the U.S./EU </p><p>can work together, including in such areas as export controls </p><p>and IAEA. </p><p> </p><p>Trade </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p>20. (SBU) Laying down a marker on GMOs once again, the U.S. </p><p>side reiterated that the U.S. government is committed to </p><p>getting access to the European market.  Commission officials </p><p>replied that a recent regulation adopted by the European </p><p>Parliament would increase transparency in the regulatory </p><p>system for GMOs and increase consumer confidence.  Officials </p><p>also pointed out that they have started infringement </p><p>proceedings against member states that have not implemented </p><p>the GMO deliberate release directive.   Echoing the comment </p><p>of DG Trade official de Laet on the US Bioterrorism law (para </p><p>10 above), English noted that the USG views the </p><p>recently-passed laws on traceability and labeling and food </p><p>and feed to be fundamentally flawed, regardless of how they </p><p>might be implemented.  The USG reserves its right to consider </p><p>a WTO challenge on the basis of the restrictions the laws </p><p>raise to trade, he added.  After the recent meeting of </p><p>European Parliamentarians and the Congressional Delegation </p><p>led by Chairman Henry Hyde, both sides understand better the </p><p>perspectives of the other, which should lay a solid </p><p>foundation for future talks, Commission officials remarked. </p><p> </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>21. (SBU) The U.S. delegation notified Commission and </p><p>Presidency officials that it will sponsor a resolution on </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>women and political participation and will seek EU support. </p><p>The U.S. also hopes the EU will help convince the Africa </p><p>Group to stop blocking key resolutions on African nations </p><p>such as Zimbabwe. </p><p> </p><p>22. (SBU) Regarding the proposed WEOG rotation for the Human </p><p>Rights Commission, the U.S. hopes a solution can be found </p><p>that will allow U.S. participation on an appropriate </p><p>schedule.  The U.S could not consent to the Dutch/Canadian </p><p>proposal that would have left the U.S. off the board for two </p><p>years. </p><p> </p><p>Justice and Home Affairs </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>23. (U) Participants in the JHA task force meeting provided </p><p>highlights of their two-day discussion (reported septel). </p><p> </p><p>24. (U) This cable was cleared by EUR/ERA and USEU. </p><p>Sembler </p><p>NNNN </p><p>	2003ROME03360 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
