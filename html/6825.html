<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KUWAIT 001101 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR TASK FORCE 1 - EB ACTION OFFICER </p><p>STATE ALSO FOR EB/ESC AND NEA/ARP </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA </p><p>USDOC FOR 4520/MAC/AME </p><p>DOE FOR IE - L. COBURN AND C. WASHINGTON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 1.6 X5, X6 </p><p>TAGS: EPET, KU </p><p>SUBJECT: KUWAIT OIL UPDATE -- MARCH 26, 2003 </p><p> </p><p>REF: KUWAIT 1078 AND PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM Frank C. Urbancic for reasons 1.5. (B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Local press reports on 3/26 noted the visit of the </p><p>acting Minister of Oil, Sheikh Ahmed Al-Fahed Al-Sabah to the </p><p>Ratqa oil field where he met with the Kuwait oil firefighting </p><p>team.  The press report notes the cooperation of the Kuwaiti </p><p>team with an American team could result in all the fires in </p><p>the Rumaila field being extinguished within ten days.  The </p><p>report also states that work was delayed 3 hours on Tuesday </p><p>because of poor weather; no work was scheduled for Wednesday </p><p>to allow the teams to integrate their efforts. </p><p>2. (C/NF) Embassy notes that despite earlier statements that </p><p>KOC would increase production from the Ratqa field in </p><p>northern Kuwait by up to 30,000 bpd in order to reduce </p><p>reservoir pressure and advance firefighting efforts in the </p><p>southern Rumaila field, KOC numbers over the last few days </p><p>have shown a drop in production from the north.  When Embassy </p><p>began receiving KOC reports, KOC North production was 423,432 </p><p>bbls (March 17).  Today\'s figure for KOC North is almost 5.5% </p><p>below that (400,265 bbls).  Separately, post notes that </p><p>stocks of Kuwait Export Crude have grown from 4,502,279 bbls </p><p>on March 17 to 5,816,692 bbls on March 26 - a 29% increase in </p><p>nine days.  While we suspect this is well within normal </p><p>operating limits, it could also be interpreted as a slowing </p><p>of regularly scheduled tanker loadings.  Post is seeking </p><p>clarifications on these issues. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Following is unedited data set received from Kuwait </p><p>Petroleum Corporation afternoon of 3/26/03.
