<p>UNCLAS ANKARA 004621 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EUR/SE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PHUM, TU, TIP IN TURKEY </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKISH GOVERNMENT RELEASES ANTI-TIP CIRCULAR </p><p>FOCUSED ON IMPLEMENTATION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 171293 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. In a significant step to further implementation of Turkish </p><p>laws and policy combating trafficking in persons, the </p><p>Interior Ministry (MOI) recently issued a circular to all </p><p>governors and senior security officials -- including the </p><p>Jandarma -- calling for tougher implementation of existing </p><p>regulations.  In a conversation with us July 22, MOI </p><p>Secretary General Nezih Dogan confirmed press reports that </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>the new circular is part of the wider GOT Action Plan to </p><p>combat TIP.  According to Dogan, the circular: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- increases the penalty against those who force foreigners </p><p>into prostitution -- those convicted of trafficking in </p><p>persons will face 5-10 years "heavy imprisonment;" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- grants temporary visa extensions and/or supplementary </p><p>residency permits to victims of trafficking and instructs </p><p>that they be treated as victims not criminals; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- instructs local officials to establish shelters for </p><p>victims; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- instructs border control personnel to be more alert to the </p><p>status of groups of young women entering Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. Dogan asserted to us that this circular "is much more </p><p>detailed" than previous memoranda on trafficking.  The </p><p>circular also includes an "Implementation Guide" designed to </p><p>spell out exactly who is responsible for carrying out MOI\'s </p><p>instructions on TIP.  The circular, Dogan explained, outlines </p><p>a four-tier system of monitoring implementation: 1) governors </p><p>and police chiefs; 2) MOI Inspectors; 3) Public Prosecutors; </p><p>and 4) public opinion, which Dogan said is becoming more </p><p>outspoken and therefore more influential on this issue. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. This circular was noted in a number of local newspapers, </p><p>demonstrating the interest of the GOT in informing public </p><p>opinion to motivate the public to assist in combating TIP. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. We will continue to follow up with MOI officials to </p><p>underscore the importance of implementation of GOT anti-TIP </p><p>initiatives. </p><p>DEUTSCH </p><p></p></div>
