IRVING FOR </p><p>REASONS: 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY: THE RULING ZANU-PF IS TAKING A </p><p>DIFFERENT TACK IN ITS CAMPAIGN TO CLAMP DOWN ON THE </p><p>OPPOSITION BY FORCING THROUGH PARLIAMENT LEGISLATION </p><p>THAT AIMS TO RESTRICT OPPOSITION ACTIVITIES.  IN AN </p><p>EXTRAORDINARY SESSION ON APRIL 3-4, ZANU-PF </p><p>PARLIAMENTARIANS SUSPENDED THE LEGISLATURE\'S OWN </p><p>STANDING ORDERS TO PASS THE BROADCASTING SERVICES BILL </p><p>AND THE POLITICAL PARTIES FINANCE BILL INTO LAW OVER THE </p><p>STRENUOUS OBJECTIONS OF THE OPPOSITION AND AT LEAST ONE </p><p>ZANU-PF MP.  THE BROADCASTING SERVICES ACT LIMITS </p><p>BROADCASTING LICENSES TO ONE PRIVATELY-OWNED RADIO AND </p><p>ONE TELEVISION STATION.  THE POLITICAL PARTIES FINANCE </p><p>ACT PROHIBITS FOREIGN SOURCES OF FUNDING FOR POLITICAL </p><p>PARTIES.  OTHER BILLS BEFORE PARLIAMENT, INCLUDING THE </p><p>CITIZENSHIP OF ZIMBABWE AMENDMENT AND THE LABOR </p><p>RELATIONS AMENDMENT, WILL TRY TO FENCE IN OTHER </p><p>TRADITIONAL OPPOSITION SUPPORTERS, NAMELY WHITES AND </p><p>UNIONISTS.  ALTHOUGH THIS NEW ELEMENT OF ZANU-PF\'S </p><p>CAMPAIGN STRATEGY IS CERTAINLY MORE LAWFUL THAN ITS </p><p>PREVIOUS TACTICS, IT COULD POTENTIALLY BE MORE </p><p>DEVASTATING TO THE OPPOSITION THAN ANY INTIMIDATION </p><p>CAMPAIGN.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) IN AN EXTRAORDINARY SESSION WHICH BEGAN ON APRIL </p><p>3 AND LASTED UNTIL 3AM ON APRIL 4, ZANU-PF </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01247  01 OF 03  051740Z </p><p>PARLIAMENTARIANS VOTED TO SUSPEND THE LEGISLATURE\'S OWN </p><p>STANDING RULES AND ORDERS TO PASS THE RESTRICTIVE </p><p>BROADCASTING SERVICES BILL AND THE POLITICAL PARTIES </p><p>FINANCE BILL INTO LAW.  THE VOTE TO SUSPEND THE RULES </p><p>WAS UNUSUALLY RAUCOUS AND LOUD (POLOFF WAS INTERVIEWING </p><p>THE DEPUTY CLERK, HELEN DINGANI, IN HER OFFICE NEXT TO </p><p>THE CHAMBER AT THE TIME), AS DEPUTY SPEAKER MADZONGWE </p><p>ASKED THE MPS TO VOTE BY DIVISION, I.E. STAND ON ONE </p><p>SIDE OF THE CHAMBER OR THE OTHER.  THE PROCEEDINGS TOOK </p><p>NEARLY AN HOUR.  BASED ON THE MOTIONS TO SUSPEND PUT </p><p>FORTH BY LEADER OF THE HOUSE (AND JUSTICE MINISTER) </p><p>PATRICK CHINAMASA, THE DEPUTY CLERK TOLD POLOFF THAT IT </p><p>WAS CLEAR ZANU-PF WAS TRYING TO "BULLDOZE" THE TWO BILLS </p><p>THROUGH PARLIAMENT.  THE SUSPENSION OF THE RULES ALLOWED </p><p>NO DEBATE ON THE PARLIAMENTARY LEGAL COMMITTEE\'S (PLC) </p><p>ADVERSE REPORTS THAT DECLARED BOTH BILLS </p><p>UNCONSTITUTIONAL.  ALL THREE READINGS, THE DEBATE, AND </p><p>VOTING TOOK PLACE IN THE SAME SESSION, WHICH IS NORMALLY </p><p>NOT PERMITTED.  ZANU-PF MP AND PLC CHAIR EDDISON ZVOBGO </p><p>WAS SO DISGUSTED WITH THE PROCEEDINGS THAT HE LEFT THE </p><p>CHAMBER, APPARENTLY SO THAT HE WOULD NOT BE FORCED TO </p><p>VOTE AGAINST HIS PARTY OR HIS OWN ADVERSE REPORT. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) DURING THE SESSION, THE HOUSE VOTED TO REJECT A </p><p>SECOND ADVERSE REPORT ON THE BROADCASTING BILL SUBMITTED </p><p>BY THE PARLIAMENTARY LEGAL COMMITTEE (PLC).  THE </p><p>COMMITTEE, WHICH COMPRISES TWO ZANU-PF MPS AND ONE MDC </p><p>MP (ONLY TWO MEMBERS OF THE PLC CAN VOTE BECAUSE THE </p><p>THIRD MEMBER IS NOT A LAWYER), HAD EARLIER SUBMITTED AN </p><p>ADVERSE REPORT CALLING THE LICENSING REGULATIONS UPON </p><p>WHICH THE BILL WAS BASED UNCONSTITUTIONAL (SEE REF B). </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  01247  01 OF 03  051740Z </p><p>ACCORDING TO THE APRIL 4 EDITION OF THE GOVERNMENT- </p><p>CONTROLLED "THE HERALD," IT IS THE FIRST TIME SINCE </p><p>INDEPENDENCE THAT THE RULING PARTY HAS REJECTED ADVERSE </p><p>REPORTS SUBMITTED BY A PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEE.  LAST </p><p>WEEK, PARLIAMENT VOTED TO SUSPEND THE STANDING ORDERS TO </p><p>CUT DOWN THE TIME ALLOTTED FOR THE PLC TO SUBMIT ITS </p><p>REPORT ON THE POLITICAL PARTIES FINANCE BILL FROM 26 </p><p>DAYS TO FOUR DAYS, ACCORDING TO PRISCILLA MISIHAIRABWI- </p><p>MUSHONGA, THE MDC MP FOR GLEN NORAH.  THE BLATANT </p><p>SUSPENSION OF THE RULES THIS WEEK AND LAST PERMITTED </p><p>ZANU-PF TO RAM THROUGH THE BILLS BEFORE PARLIAMENT </p><p>ADJOURNED FOR A FOUR-WEEK BREAK ON APRIL 5, AND BEFORE </p><p>THE BROADCASTING REGULATIONS IMPLEMENTED BY PRESIDENT </p><p>MUGABE LAST YEAR EXPIRE ON APRIL 12 (REF A). </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) THE MAJOR PROVISIONS OF THE BROADCASTING </p><p>SERVICES ACT ALLOW THE LICENSING OF ONE NATIONAL RADIO </p><p>SERVICE AND ONE NATIONAL TELEVISION SERVICE INDEPENDENT </p><p>OF ANY PUBLIC BROADCASTER (I.E., THE ZIMBABWE </p><p>BROADCASTING CORPORATION).  HOWEVER, THE ACT STIPULATES </p><p>THAT A SEPARATE SIGNAL CARRIER LICENSE IS REQUIRED (THE </p><p>BROADCASTERS CANNOT BROADCAST WITHOUT THE SIGNAL </p><p>CARRIER) AND CANNOT BE ISSUED TO THOSE WHO HOLD THE </p><p>BROADCASTING SERVICE LICENSES.

(COMMENT: TECHNICALLY, IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE </p><p>FOR ONE OF ZIMBABWE\'S CELLULAR TELEPHONE COMPANIES TO BE </p><p>THE SIGNAL CARRIER FOR THE RADIO BROADCASTER.  HOWEVER, </p><p>BECAUSE OF THE CELLULAR COMPANIES\' CONNECTIONS TO THE </p><p>OPPOSITION, THIS IS NOT LIKELY TO OCCUR.  END COMMENT.) </p><p>IN ADDITION, THE MINISTER OF INFORMATION WILL HAVE THE </p><p>FINAL STAMP OF APPROVAL ON ISSUING ALL LICENSES, AND </p><p>WILL BE ABLE TO REVOKE THE LICENSES UNDER BROADLY- </p><p>DEFINED CIRCUMSTANCES.  THE GOZ WILL BE ABLE TO SAY THAT </p><p>ZIMBABWE ALLOWS INDEPENDENT BROADCASTERS, AND FREE </p><p>SPEECH, BUT IN PRACTICE IT WILL MAINTAIN CONTROL OF ALL </p><p>THE BROADCASTING OPERATIONS IN THE COUNTRY, UNDERMINING </p><p>THE NOTION THAT ANY NEW BROADCASTERS WILL BE TRULY </p><p>INDEPENDENT. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) THE POLITICAL PARTIES FINANCE ACT IS </p><p>POTENTIALLY MORE SERIOUS IN HOW IT WOULD LIMIT </p><p>OPPOSITION FUNDING AS WELL AS INDIRECT ASSISTANCE, SUCH </p><p>AS TECHNICAL TRAINING.  THE ACT OUTLAWS THE RECEIPT OF </p><p>FOREIGN DONATIONS BY POLITICAL PARTIES, INCLUDING FROM </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN CITIZENS LIVING ABROAD.  FOR ANYONE FOUND </p><p>VIOLATING THE ACT, IT PROVIDES A FINE EQUIVALENT TO THE </p><p>AMOUNT OF THE DONATION OR 100,000 ZIMBABWE DOLLARS </p><p>(ABOUT US$1,000), WHICHEVER IS GREATER.  THE ACT ALSO </p><p>ALLOWS THE MINISTER OF JUSTICE TO ISSUE REGULATIONS </p><p>GOVERNING THE TRACKING AND ACCOUNTING OF POLITICAL PARTY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01247  02 OF 03  051741Z </p><p>DONATIONS.  THE ACT, WHICH REPLACES THE POLITICAL </p><p>PARTIES FINANCE ACT OF 1992, STILL STIPULATES THAT THE </p><p>MINISTER OF JUSTICE CAN REJECT A PARTY\'S APPLICATION FOR </p><p>GOVERNMENT FUNDING, EVEN IF IT IS ENTITLED TO FUNDING </p><p>BASED ON THE NUMBER OF VOTES IT RECEIVED IN THE LAST </p><p>GENERAL ELECTION.  SINCE THE OPPOSITION MDC HAS TO DATE </p><p>RECEIVED MUCH OF ITS FUNDING FROM FOREIGN SOURCES, THE </p><p>ACT WILL UNDOUBTEDLY MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR THE MDC </p><p>TO RAISE MONEY. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) DAVID COLTART, MDC MP FOR BULAWAYO SOUTH, TOLD </p><p>POLITICAL SECTION CHIEF APRIL 5 THAT THE MDC WILL </p><p>CHALLENGE THE LEGALITY OF THE POLITICAL PARTIES FINANCE </p><p>ACT IN THE COURTS.  OF PARTICULAR CONCERN IS THE ACT\'S </p><p>STIPULATION THAT FOREIGN DONATIONS THROUGH THIRD PARTIES </p><p>(INCLUDING NGOS) ARE NO LONGER PERMITTED, HE STATED. </p><p>THE STIPULATION IS SUFFICIENTLY BROAD TO PUT A </p><p>STRANGLEHOLD ON CIVIL SOCIETY, MUCH OF WHICH IS INVOLVED </p><p>IN DEMOCRACY AND GOVERNANCE ISSUES.  COLTART POINTED OUT </p><p>THAT THE NEW LAW DOES NOT PROHIBIT LOANS TO POLITICAL </p><p>PARTIES, AND HE IS INVESTIGATING HOW THE MDC AND NGOS </p><p>COULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS LOOPHOLE.  THE MDC MP </p><p>PROFESSED THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS LIKELY TO APPLY THE LAW </p><p>SELECTIVELY, AND WILL IGNORE ZANU-PF VIOLATIONS.  ALSO </p><p>OF CONCERN IS A REPORT THAT ZANU-PF IS DRAFTING A BILL </p><p>THAT WOULD BAN ALL FOREIGN FUNDING OF NGOS--A MOVE THAT </p><p>WOULD QUICKLY SHUT DOWN MOST OF ZIMBABWE\'S INCREASINGLY </p><p>VIBRANT AND DIVERSE CIVIL SOCIETY.  IF ZANU-PF PERSISTS </p><p>IN ITS PURSUIT TO INDIRECTLY OUTLAW SOURCES OF </p><p>OPPOSITION SUPPORT, THE EFFECT WILL BE TO DRIVE THE </p><p>OPPOSITION UNDERGROUND, COLTART OPINED. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  01247  02 OF 03  051741Z </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) OTHER BILLS BEFORE PARLIAMENT COULD ALSO </p><p>HINDER THE OPPOSITION.  A PROPOSED AMENDMENT TO THE </p><p>CITIZENSHIP OF ZIMBABWE ACT SEEKS TO CLOSE A LOOPHOLE IN </p><p>THE LAW THAT ALREADY PROHIBITS ZIMBABWEAN CITIZENS FROM </p><p>HOLDING DUAL CITIZENSHIP.  THE PROPOSED AMENDMENT WOULD </p><p>REQUIRE HOLDERS OF TWO PASSPORTS TO RENOUNCE THEIR </p><p>CITIZENSHIP OF THE FOREIGN COUNTRY ACCORDING TO THE LAWS </p><p>OF THAT COUNTRY IF THEY ARE TO REMAIN ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>CITIZENS.  (NOTE: THE CURRENT LAW STIPULATES THAT DUAL </p><p>CITIZENS MUST RENOUNCE THEIR CITIZENSHIP ONLY ACCORDING </p><p>TO THE LAWS OF ZIMBABWE.  IN A TEST CASE LAST DECEMBER, </p><p>THE SUPREME COURT RULED IN FAVOR OF A ZIMBABWEAN WHO </p><p>ALSO HELD A BRITISH PASSPORT.  THE REGISTRAR-GENERAL HAD </p><p>REFUSED TO RENEW HER ZIMBABWEAN PASSPORT EVEN THOUGH SHE </p><p>HAD RENOUNCED HER BRITISH CITIZENSHIP ACCORDING TO THE </p><p>LAWS OF ZIMBABWE.  ALTHOUGH WE ARE NOT LAWYERS, THE NEW </p><p>BILL\'S EXTRATERRITORIAL PROVISIONS MAY BE DIFFICULT TO </p><p>ENFORCE AND MAY NOT STAND UP TO A COURT CHALLENGE.  END </p><p>NOTE.)  THE PROPOSED AMENDMENT WOULD REDUCE THE PERIOD </p><p>THAT A DUAL CITIZEN CAN LEGALLY COMPLY FROM ONE YEAR TO </p><p>SIX MONTHS.  THE PRIMARY TARGET OF THE AMENDMENT IS THE </p><p>APPROXIMATELY 30,000 WHITES WHO HOLD BOTH ZIMBABWEAN AND </p><p>BRITISH PASSPORTS.  THE GOVERNMENT IS CLEARLY BANKING </p><p>THAT MOST OF THESE DUAL CITIZENS WILL CHOOSE TO RETAIN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ4443 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  01247  03 OF 03  051741Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00  CIP-00 </p><p>      DINT-00  DODE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00 </p><p>      FAAE-00  FBIE-00  FCC-01   VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00 </p><p>      IO-00    LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  OIC-02 </p><p>      OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00 </p><p>      SP-00    SSO-00   STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00 </p><p>      PRM-01   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00    /011W </p><p>                  ------------------DBFE91  051741Z /38 </p><p>O 051745Z APR 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 8590 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 HARARE 001247 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JFRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR BWILLIAMS </p><p>NAIROBI FOR TPFLAUMER </p><p>USAID FOR AA/AFR VDICKSON-HORTON, AFR/SA CPALMA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/05/11 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, ECPS, KDEM, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: ZIMBABWE PARLIAMENT BECOMES RULING PARTY\'S </p><p>LATEST TOOL IN CORNERING THE OPPOSITION </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  01247  03 OF 03  051741Z </p><p> </p><p>THEIR BRITISH CITIZENSHIP, THUS RENDERING THEM </p><p>INELIGIBLE TO VOTE IN THE UPCOMING PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>ELECTION.  ZIMBABWE\'S WHITE POPULATION OVERWHELMINGLY </p><p>FAVORS THE MDC.  THE AMENDMENT HAS BEEN TABLED, AND WAS </p><p>GAZETTEQON MARCH 23, WHICH MEANS IT WILL NEXT GO TO THE </p><p>LEGAL COMMITTEE FOR CONSIDERATION. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) THE LABOR RELATIONS BILL, ONCE PASSED INTO </p><p>LAW, WOULD HAVE THE EFFECT OF LIMITING THE ABILITY OF </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S UNIONS TO ENGAGE IN STAYAWAYS OR OTHER LABOR </p><p>ACTIONS, THEREBY WEAKENING ANOTHER KEY SOURCE OF </p><p>OPPOSITION SUPPORT.  (SEE REF A FOR DETAILS OF THE </p><p>BILL\'S PROVISIONS.)  THE PARLIAMENTARY LEGAL COMMITTEE </p><p>ALSO ISSUED AN ADVERSE REPORT ON THE LABOR RELATIONS </p><p>BILL, CALLING MANY PROVISIONS UNCONSTITUTIONAL. </p><p>ACCORDING TO THE DEPUTY CLERK OF PARLIAMENT, THE BILL IS </p><p>LESS OF A PRIORITY FOR THE GOVERNMENT, AND MAY BE HELD </p><p>OVER UNTIL THE FINAL TWO-WEEK MEETING OF PARLIAMENT IN </p><p>MAY OR THE SECOND SESSION, WHICH DOES NOT BEGIN UNTIL </p><p>LATE JUNE OR JULY. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) COMMENT: ZANU-PF HAS RIDDEN ROUGHSHOD OVER </p><p>OPPOSITION MPS IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS TO PUSH THROUGH A </p><p>LEGISLATIVE AGENDA THAT IS CLEARLY AIMED AT SHRINKING </p><p>THE OPPOSITION\'S POLITICAL SPACE IN ZIMBABWE.  ALTHOUGH </p><p>ZANU-PF MPS FOLLOWED THE LETTER OF PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>PROCEDURE, THEY BLATANTLY DISPENSED WITH ALL SENSE OF </p><p>FAIR PLAY OR PRETENSION OF PURSUING NATIONAL INTERESTS </p><p>IN FAST-TRACKING IMPORTANT LEGISLATION THAT DESERVED </p><p>MORE CAREFUL SCRUTINY AND DEBATE.  THE ZANU-PF </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01247  03 OF 03  051741Z </p><p>DELEGATION\'S UNPRECEDENTED REJECTION OF SEVERAL ADVERSE </p><p>REPORTS WITHOUT ALLOWING ANY ATTEMPT TO AMEND THE BILLS </p><p>IN QUESTION DEMONSTRATES ITS ARROGANT BELIEF THAT IT </p><p>KNOWS WHAT IS BEST FOR THE COUNTRY AND THAT THE </p><p>OPPOSITION HAS NO MEANINGFUL ROLE.  THE RESULT IS THAT </p><p>THE OPPOSITION AND OTHER VOICES OF DISSENT WILL FIND </p><p>THEMSELVES MORE FENCED IN THAN EVER.  EVEN THOUGH ALL </p><p>THE BILLS COULD BE CHALLENGED ON CONSTITUTIONAL GROUNDS, </p><p>THE RESOURCES FOR THE OPPOSITION TO DO SO ARE QUICKLY </p><p>DRYING UP, WHICH IS PROBABLY PART OF THE GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>INTENT IN PURSUING A MORE LEGAL STRATEGY THAT WILL </p><p>RESTRICT FUNDING FOR MDC COURT CHALLENGES.  AS TENDAI </p><p>BITI STATED IN PARLIAMENT ON APRIL 4, "IT IS MORALLY </p><p>WRONG FOR ZANU-PF TO USE ITS UNLAWFUL MAJORITY TO PUSH </p><p>THESE BILLS THROUGH.  THE REPRESSIVE LEGISLATION SHOWS A </p><p>MARKED DIFFERENCE OF APPROACH TOWARD MORE FASCISM."
