<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L STATE 146571 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PTER, PREL, RS </p><p>SUBJECT:  RUSSIAN INTEREST IN COUNTER-TERRORISM </p><p>COOPERATION </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL -- ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY: RUSSIAN EMBASSY COUNSELLOR EDWARD MALAYAN, </p><p>ACCOMPANIED BY SECOND SECRETARY BUGAYEV, CALLED ON S/CT </p><p>DIRECTOR FOR REGIONAL AFFAIRS JON GREENWALD MAY 6 TO </p><p>PICK UP COPY OF THE DEPARTMENT\'S JUST ISSUED REPORT </p><p>"PATTERNS OF TERRORISM 1991."   HE CONFIRMED RUSSIAN </p><p>INTEREST IN RESUMING THE DIALOGUE ON COUNTER-TERRORISM </p><p>COOPERATION WITH THE U.S. THAT HAD BEEN INTERRUPTED WITH </p><p>THE DISSOLUTION OF THE SOVIET UNION.  GREENWALD SAID THE </p><p>U.S. WOULD WELCOME THIS AT A TIME WHEN THE RUSSIAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT WAS READY TO PROCEED SINCE THERE WERE </p><p>PRACTICAL ISSUES WHICH IT COULD BENEFIT BOTH SIDES TO </p><p>DISCUSS. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  GREENWALD SAID THAT THE NEW REPORT PRESENTED A MIXED </p><p>PICTURE.  THERE HAD BEEN POSITIVE DEVELOPMENTS DURING </p><p>THE YEAR, INCLUDING THE EXCELLENT INTERNATIONAL </p><p>COOPERATION AGAINST IRAQI TERRORISM CAPABILITIES AT THE </p><p>TIME OF THE GULF WAR AND THE BEGINNING OF THE UNITED </p><p>NATIONS\' EFFORT TO ACHIEVE JUSTICE IN THE PAN AM AND UTA </p><p>BOMBINGS AND END LIBYAN SPONSORSHIP OF TERRORISM.  IT </p><p>WAS OBVIOUS FROM THE REPORT, HOWEVER. THAT TERRORISM </p><p>REMAINED A SERIOUS CONCERN AND A HIGH USG PRIORITY. </p><p> </p><p>4.  MALAYAN ASKED ABOUT PROSPECTS FOR LIBYAN COMPLIANCE </p><p>WITH THE SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTIONS AND SAID THE </p><p>DECISION TO REMOVE RUSSIAN MILITARY ADVISERS HAD BEEN </p><p>PAINFUL FOR MOSCOW SINCE IT FORFEITED HARD CURRENCY. </p><p>GREENWALD SAID SANCTIONS WERE GENERALLY BEING ADHERED TO </p><p>VERY WELL, WITH SOME ROOM FOR QUESTION ON THE </p><p>APPROPRIATE STANDARD FOR "SIGNIFICANT" REDUCTION OF </p><p>LIBYAN DIPLOMATIC PRESENCE.  THE UNSC WOULD REVIEW THE </p><p>COMPLIANCE REPORTS TO BE SUBMITTED BY MEMBER STATES BY </p><p>MAY 15.  IT WAS TOO EARLY TO KNOW WHETHER THE SANCTIONS </p><p>WOULD PRODUCE THE DESIRED EFFECT ON LIBYA, HE SAID, BUT </p><p>THE TIGHTER THEIR APPLICATION, THE BETTER THE CHANCE. </p><p>THE U.S. KNEW HOW DIFFICULT THE MILITARY ADVISER </p><p>DECISION HAD BEEN, HE SAID, AND DEEPLY APPRECIATED THE </p><p>RUSSIAN POSITION. </p><p> </p><p>5.  IN RESPONSE TO MALAYAN\'S QUESTION, GREENWALD SAID </p><p>THE RECENT TIME MAGAZINE COVER STORY QUESTIONING THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S VERSION OF THE PAN AM BOMBING WAS BASED ON </p><p>OLD REPORTS THAT HAD BEEN THOROUGHLY CHECKED OUT AT THE </p><p>TIME AND WERE CONSIDERED GROUNDLESS.  MALAYAN SAID "WE </p><p>LOOKED INTO THEM AND REACHED THE SAME CONCLUSION." </p><p> </p><p>6.  THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT WAS STILL IN SOME FLUX WITH </p><p>RESPECT TO RESPONSIBILITY FOR COUNTER-TERRORISM, MALAYAN </p><p>SAID.  HE EXECTED THE LEGAL ADVISER TO RETAIN THE </p><p>PRIMARY ROLE ON THE MFA SIDE.  IAKOVLEV, WHO HAD </p><p>CONDUCTED THE INITIAL BILATERAL CONSULTATIONS FOR THE </p><p>SOVIET UNION WITH AMBASSADOR BUSBY IN 1990-1991, </p><p>HOWEVER, HAD BEEN REMOVED IN DECEMBER.  HIS "YOUNG" </p><p>REPLACEMENT WAS ABOUT TO BE TRANSFERED AS AMBASSADOR TO </p><p>THE NETHERLANDS, AND IT WAS UNCLEAR WHO WOULD TAKE </p><p>OVER.  WE WOULD FIND, HE ADDED, THAT MOST OF THE KGB </p><p>SPECIALISTS WITH WHOM WE HAD DEALT IN THOSE SESSIONS </p><p>CONTINUED TO OCCUPY SIMILAR POSITIONS IN THE NEW RUSSIAN </p><p>INTELLIGENCE AGENCY. </p><p> </p><p>7.  THE U.S. WAS INTERESTED IN TAKING UP THIS IMPORTANT </p><p>DIALOGUE WHEN THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT WAS READY, </p><p>GREENWALD SAID.  A U.S. DELEGATION WAS IN MOSCOW THIS </p><p>WEEK FOR THE EXPERT LEVEL TALKS CALLED FOR UNDER THE </p><p>MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING ON AIRCRAFT HIJACKING </p><p>PROCEDURES, BUT WE WISHED TO PURSUE ALSO THE BROADER </p><p>THEMES THAT HAD BEGUN TO BE DISCUSSED PRODUCTIVELY WITH </p><p>THE SOVIET UNION. </p><p> </p><p>8.  MALAYAN SAID THAT THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT AGREED IT </p><p>WAS IMPORTANT TO RESUME THIS DIALOGUE.  IN ADDITION TO </p><p>ISSUES SUCH AS LIBYA, HE SAID, THE SITUATION IN PARTS OF </p><p>THE FORMER SOVIET UNION GAVE RISE TO TERRORISM </p><p>CONCERNS.  RUSSIA CONTINUED TO WORRY ABOUT NUCLEAR </p><p>TERRORISM, WHICH HAD BEEN RAISED BY THE SOVIET </p><p>DELEGATION IN EARLIER CONSULTATIONS AND HAD ACQUIRED </p><p>MORE URGENCY WITH THE BREAKUP OF THE SOVIET UNION. </p><p>THERE HAD EVEN BEEN SUCH A THREAT AT ONE POINT BY </p><p>CHECHENS IN THEIR DISPUTE WITH MOSCOW, HE NOTED. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BAKER </p><p></p></div>
