We trust that the information provided below </p><p>adequately clarifies the position taken by The Netherlands in </p><p>the Expert Group (EG) of the Wassenaar Arrangement on this </p><p>issue. </p><p> </p><p>When the US proposal on DLC controls was discussed at the </p><p>April 2003 meeting of the EG, the Netherlands asked for </p><p>"study time" and stated that an extension of the validity </p><p>would be an option.  This position has been clearly reflected </p><p>in the report of the Chairman WA-EG(03)CHAIR009.  This does </p><p>not necessarily imply that we advocate lifting controls of </p><p>DLC technology by letting the validity note expire.  Asking </p><p>for "study time" on complex issues is a normal procedure </p><p>within the List Review process which is used by all WA </p><p>Participating States, including the US. </p><p> </p><p>We have since posed several technical questions to the US </p><p>Delegation to the EG, particularly on the use of DLC coating </p><p>technology in Beryllium alloys.  This unleashed a discussion </p><p>that is still ongoing.  Our experts claim that DLC coating on </p><p>Beryllium has so far only been used for military goods.  This </p><p>would mean that DLC coating technology on Beryllium should be </p><p>controlled under ML22 of the Munitions List, together with </p><p>other military technologies.  On the other hand, DLC coating </p><p>on Beryllium-alloys (Note:  "alloys" bolded in original text. </p><p> End Note.) is widely used in civilian applications, e.g. in </p><p>the field of mould production for die-casting and injection </p><p>molding of plastics and other synthetic materials.  Therefore </p><p>we would like an extension of the exclusion note in this </p><p>particular field. </p><p> </p><p>The intent is to discuss the issue of DLC coating during the </p><p>intercessional expert meeting in London in late July 2003, as </p><p>organized by the UK. </p><p> </p><p>The Netherlands is confident that mutually acceptable </p><p>conclusion can be reached. </p><p> </p><p>END TEXT </p><p> </p><p>RUSSEL </p><p></p></div>
