<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L RANGOON 000897 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/28/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, KISL, BM, Human Rights, Ethnics </p><p>SUBJECT: MOSQUE RAZED, PARAMILITARIES TRAINED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: CDA, a.i.: RON MCMULLEN FOR REASON 1.5(D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Trouble in Sittwe:  Local officials on July 22 </p><p>reportedly tore down a mosque in Sittwe, 70 miles SE of the </p><p>Bangladeshi border, and arrested seven Muslims, one of whom </p><p>subsequently died in custody.  This information came to us </p><p>from Bangladeshi, Pakistani, and UN contacts.  Apparently the </p><p>mosque\'s leadership made unauthorized improvements to the </p><p>structure, resulting in the decision by local authorities to </p><p>tear down the whole building.  Buddhist monks and Muslim </p><p>shopkeepers also clashed on July 18 in Pyinmana, a small town </p><p>between Mandalay and Rangoon, according to local media </p><p>reports. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Paramilitary training:  A trusted Burmese contact </p><p>claims the USDA-affiliated "Power Ranger" militia is </p><p>receiving rudimentary riot-control and military training in </p><p>central Burma and elsewhere.  "They are being told their </p><p>mission is to hold up any attacking Americans long enough for </p><p>Russia and China to come to the rescue," he explained. </p><p>Chuckling, he added, "The Russians--that\'s a good one." </p><p>Media reports also claim the GOB is training a paramilitary </p><p>"Peoples Militia" in Arakan State to assist in putting down </p><p>any general uprising. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Comment: Muslim-Buddhist troubles have periodically </p><p>flared up in Sittwe and elsewhere.  We frequently hear </p><p>stories of pro-SPDC "fake monks" allegedly inciting violence </p><p>against Muslims to deflect anti-regime ire.  This does not </p><p>seem to be the case in these latest incidents, and, with the </p><p>political temperature in Burma quite high, any incident could </p><p>quickly get out of hand.  A leader of the student rebellion </p><p>of 1988 told us recently that he thinks there will be </p><p>substantial bloodshed in Burma before year\'s end.  Perhaps </p><p>the training of various paramilitary groups indicates the </p><p>generals share this view.  End Comment. </p><p>McMullen </p><p></p></div>
