<p>UNCLAS HARARE 000336 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EB/CBA Michael A. Garcia </p><p> </p><p>E. O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: BEXP, BBSR, ECON, EINV, ETRD, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: Mission Assistance to U.S. Business </p><p> </p><p>Ref: State 29441 </p><p> </p><p>1.  Reftel asks us to summarize efforts to assist U.S. </p><p>businesses, including success cases, here in Zimbabwe. </p><p>Because of our strained bilateral relations, it is often </p><p>not practical for the Embassy to advocate on behalf U.S. </p><p>businesses.  We have lobbied the GOZ, thus far </p><p>unsuccessfully, to return farms or offer compensation to </p><p>several Amcit farmers, whose land has been seized under </p><p>fast-track land reform. </p><p> </p><p>2. In our daily dealings with U.S. firms and through the </p><p>American Business Association, which we presently </p><p>administer, we have let the American business community </p><p>know that we are available to provide any level of </p><p>support.  Most of our daily assistance does not rise to </p><p>the "success story" level, however.  We sporadically </p><p>provide gold-key service in conjunction with the U.S. </p><p>Commercial Service, but given the paucity of new foreign </p><p>direct investment in Zimbabwe (FDI inflows have dropped </p><p>from US$ 444 to 3 million in the last 5 years), this is </p><p>not a big part of our workload.  For that reason, our </p><p>role is slightly different than that of our counterparts </p><p>in more stable economies.  Most U.S. companies are merely </p><p>trying to tread water rather than expand business. </p><p> </p><p>Sullivan </p><p></p></div>
