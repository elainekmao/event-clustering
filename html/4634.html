<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 007125 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>TREASURY FOR MILLS/PIPATANAGUL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/04/2012 </p><p>TAGS: ETTC, ETRD, EPET, EFIN, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDAN-IRAQ TRADE AND OIL PROTOCOLS NEARLY SET FOR </p><p>2003 </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. AMMAN 6649 </p><p>     B. AMMAN 185 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Charge D\'Affaires Gregory Berry, reasons 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p> </p><p>1.  (c)  Following preliminary negotiations in Baghdad, terms </p><p>for Jordan\'s annual oil and trade protocols with Iraq have </p><p>been nearly agreed to, according to senior GOJ officials. </p><p>The terms for the oil protocol will be virtually identical to </p><p>last year\'s agreement, with minor adjustments to quantities </p><p>to reflect changing demand in Jordan.  The value of the trade </p><p>protocol will likely be set at $310 million.  GOJ officials </p><p>dismiss as totally baseless media reports that Jordan is </p><p>planning to re-export refined petroleum products to Iraq. </p><p>End summary. </p><p> </p><p>Oil Deal Remains the Same </p><p> </p><p>2.  (c)  According to senior officials in Jordan\'s Trade and </p><p>Energy Ministries who participated in recent negotiations in </p><p>Baghdad (ref A), the terms for the 2003 trade and oil </p><p>protocols between Jordan and Iraq are nearly agreed.  On the </p><p>oil side, Energy Minister Bataineh told DCM that the </p><p>structure would be identical to last year\'s agreement (ref </p><p>B), including the reference price.  Bataineh noted that some </p><p>adjustments would be made to specific quantities of various </p><p>petroleum products to reflect changes in Jordanian demand. </p><p>Jordan will be receiving slightly more crude (Bataineh said </p><p>approximately 4.1 million tons versus 4 million last year) </p><p>due to higher overall demand, but slightly less refined </p><p>products, specifically fuel oil, to reflect Jordan\'s expected </p><p>reduction in demand for fuel oil after June 2003, when the </p><p>gas-fired turbines at the Aqaba power station are expected to </p><p>begin operation, replacing existing oil-fired turbines (see </p><p>septel for Bataineh\'s discussion of the Egypt-Aqaba gas </p><p>pipeline). </p><p> </p><p>3.  (c)  Bataineh also noted that the technical report for </p><p>the specifications of a proposed crude pipeline from the </p><p>Iraqi border to the Zarqa refinery (all on Jordanian </p><p>territory, he assured us) had been completed, and he expected </p><p>a financial offer to be issued by the GOJ within ten days. </p><p>Bataineh said there are still three international companies </p><p>expressing interest in the pipeline project.  Bataineh </p><p>categorically denied reports in the BBC that Jordan and Iraq </p><p>had agreed to re-export of refined petroleum products from </p><p>Jordan to Iraq under a "technical cooperation" agreement.  He </p><p>attributed the report to mis-translation of remarks he gave </p><p>at a somewhat harried press conference in Baghdad. </p><p> </p><p>Trade Deal to Reach $310 Million </p><p> </p><p>4.  (c)  On the trade side of the protocol, Trade Ministry </p><p>Secretary General Farouk Hadidi told ECON/C that he and Trade </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Minister Salah al Bashir agreed with their Iraqi counterparts </p><p>that goods worth $310 million would be exported from Jordan </p><p>to pay for the non-grant portion of the oil.  The increase </p><p>over the $260 million agreed to last year is due, he said, to </p><p>the higher market prices for Iraqi oil.  Hadidi said each </p><p>prospective export contract is assessed on a one-by-one basis </p><p>to ensure that there is a minimum of 40% Jordanian content to </p><p>exported goods.  Both Hadidi and Bataineh said the </p><p>negotiations were low-key and relatively smooth, though </p><p>Bataineh noted to DCM that he had witnessed some animated </p><p>discussions between Bashir and his Iraqi counterparts during </p><p>the course of the talks. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p> </p><p>5.  (c)  The protocol talks this year were, like last year, </p><p>fairly subdued.  The terms agreed in these discussions will </p><p>likely be formally approved by the cabinet by the end of the </p><p>year.  Although the Zarqa pipeline has a certain logic in the </p><p>narrow sense that it would save on transportation costs, the </p><p>GOJ is fully aware of the legal and political implications of </p><p>the proposed project, which has been on the table for some </p><p>time with little concrete progress to show.  The Jordanians </p><p>set out to make the negotiations as routine as possible, </p><p>reflecting both the sensitivity of the political situation in </p><p>the region and Jordan\'s obvious short-term interest in </p><p>continuing to receive cut-rate Iraqi oil for as long as Iraq </p><p>is willing to provide it.  Meanwhile, Iraq continues to try </p><p>to extract maximum political capital from the agreements. </p><p>But as the less extensive press coverage in Jordan of this </p><p>year\'s agreements suggests, Iraq\'s political gains from this </p><p>arrangement are increasingly less obvious. </p><p>BERRY </p><p></p></div>
