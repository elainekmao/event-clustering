REASONS: 1.5 </p><p>(B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>MEDIA COVERAGE </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) IN THE LAST SEVERAL DAYS, AS REPORTED REFTEL, TWO OF </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S INDEPENDENT NEWSPAPERS HAVE DEVOTED PROMINENT </p><p>COVERAGE TO THE MARCH 8 INTRODUCTION IN THE U.S. SENATE OF </p><p>THE ZIMBABWE DEMOCRACY AND ECONOMIC RECOVERY ACT (ZDERA). </p><p>ALTHOUGH THE ACCOUNTS IN BOTH PAPERS WERE GENERALLY </p><p>FACTUAL, THEY BOTH EMPHASIZED THAT THE BILL SEEKS TO PUNISH </p><p>PRESIDENT MUGABE AND OTHER SENIOR OFFICIALS RESPONSIBLE FOR </p><p>THE POLITICAL VIOLENCE AND BREAKDOWN IN THE RULE OF LAW BY </p><p>IMPOSING TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS AND FREEZING THEIR ASSETS. </p><p>NEITHER ARTICLE CLARIFIED THAT THE CALLS FOR TRAVEL </p><p>RESTRICTIONS AND ASSET-FREEZING ARE CONTAINED IN THE NON- </p><p>BINDING SENSE OF CONGRESS SECTION.  THE GOVERNMENT- </p><p>CONTROLLED PRINT AND BROADCAST MEDIA HAVE NOT TO DATE </p><p>CARRIED A SINGLE STORY ON THE ZDERA, BUT WE DO NOT EXPECT </p><p>THIS SILENCE TO LAST MUCH LONGER. </p><p> </p><p>REACTIONS </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOT RAISED WITH US DIRECTLY ITS </p><p>CONCERNS ABOUT THE ZDERA, BUT PROBABLY ONLY BECAUSE IT HAS </p><p>BEEN CONSUMED BY OTHER BUSINESS.  IT IS ONLY A MATTER OF </p><p>TIME BEFORE THE GOZ FOCUSES ON THIS ISSUE AND CONVOKES THE </p><p>CHARGE TO CONVEY -- IN NO UNCERTAIN TERMS -- ITS CONCERNS </p><p>ABOUT THE PROPOSED LEGISLATION.  IN THE COURSE OF A MEETING </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01079  211013Z </p><p>ON ANOTHER TOPIC ON MARCH 20, THE CHIEF OF PROTOCOL OF THE </p><p>MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS SUGGESTED TO CHARGE THAT THE </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN GOVERNMENT WOULD CALL ON THE U.S. TO "BE FAIR" </p><p>WITH ZIMBABWE AND NOT SINGLE IT OUT FOR RUIN BY IMPOSING </p><p>ECONOMIC SANCTIONS.  HE WONDERED WHY THE UNITED STATES, </p><p>VIEWED BY ZIMBABWE AS A FRIEND, SEEMED TO BE FOLLOWING </p><p>"BRITISH INSTRUCTIONS."  A NUMBER OF OUR DIPLOMATIC </p><p>CONTACTS HERE, INCLUDING THE WORLD BANK, HAVE EXPRESSED AN </p><p>INTEREST IN THE LIKELY PROSPECTS OF THE ZDERA.  CIVIL </p><p>SOCIETY GENERALLY WELCOMES IT AS A SIGN THAT THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY GENERALLY -- AND THE UNITED STATES </p><p>SPECIFICALLY -- CARES ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS IN ZIMBABWE.  IN </p><p>THE VIEW OF MANY OF OUR PRIVATE CONTACTS, ONLY </p><p>INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE OF THE KIND ENVISIONED BY THE ZDERA </p><p>CAN FORCE MUGABE AND HIS CRONIES TO RESTORE THE RULE OF </p><p>LAW. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) WHILE WE STRONGLY AGREE THAT ONLY INTERNATIONAL AND </p><p>REGIONAL PRESSURE ON THE MUGABE REGIME WILL BE EFFECTIVE IN </p><p>HALTING ZIMBABWE\'S SLIDE TOWARD POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC </p><p>DESTRUCTION, WE WISH TO POINT OUT THAT THE ZDERA MIGHT HAVE </p><p>THE OPPOSITE EFFECT.  MUGABE AND HIS CABINET ARE LIKELY TO </p><p>EMPLOY A TIME-TESTED TACTIC IN PORTRAYING THE BILL AS </p><p>ANOTHER UNJUST TOOL OF WESTERN, PRO-BRITISH INTERESTS, AND </p><p>PROBABLY LABEL IT AS RACIST INTERFERENCE.   FM MUDENGE TOLD </p><p>FORMER AMBASSADOR MCDONALD LAST JULY THAT THE ZIMBABWE </p><p>DEMOCRACY ACT (WHICH DIED IN COMMITTEE IN THE HOUSE DURING </p><p>THE PREVIOUS CONGRESSIONAL SESSION) HAD SET THE GOZ ON A </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  01079  211013Z </p><p>WAR FOOTING AND THAT THEY WOULD FIGHT US ON IT WITH ALL </p><p>MEANS AT THEIR DISPOSAL.  WE ANTICIPATE SIMILAR BLUSTERY </p><p>RHETORIC -- IN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE -- ONCE THE CURRENT BILL </p><p>BEGINS TO MOVE THROUGH THE SENATE. IN ADDITION, THE ZDERA </p><p>COULD WEAKEN THE GROWING INCLINATION WITHIN THE SOUTHERN </p><p>AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY (SADC) -- PARTICULARLY SOUTH </p><p>AFRICA -- TO TAKE A TOUGHER LINE WITH ZIMBABWE, IF THEY </p><p>FEEL OBLIGATED TO RALLY AROUND MUGABE IN THE NAME OF </p><p>REGIONAL SOLIDARITY.   THOUGH WE AT POST SHARE FULLY THE </p><p>CONCERNS EXPRESSED IN THE ZDERA, WE ARE DUTY-BOUND TO </p><p>PROVIDE OUR ASSESSMENT THAT THE BILL MAY BECOME, AT LEAST </p><p>IN THE NEAR TERM, ANOTHER PROPAGANDA TOOL FOR MUGABE IN HIS </p><p>EFFORT TO HOLD ONTO POWER BY WHATEVER MEANS NECESSARY.  ONE </p><p>WAY TO MITIGATE THE GOZ\'S LIKELY DEMONIZATION OF THE UNITED </p><p>STATES IS FOR US TO CONDUCT A VERY PUBLIC EFFORT TO </p><p>COORDINATE OUR APPROACH TOWARD ZIMBABWE WITH THE COMMUNITY </p><p>OF NATIONS. </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
