(C) REGARDLESS OF THE OUTCOME, THE PERIOD PRECEDING ZIMBABWE\'S </p><p>MARCH 9-10 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION HAS BEEN DEEPLY FLAWED.  THE </p><p>GOZ\'S OPAQUE AND UNEVEN IMPLEMENATION OF ELECTORAL PROCEDURES </p><p>GIVES MAXIMUM ADVANTAGE TO THE RULING ZANU-PF, BY MINIMIZING </p><p>VOTER TURNOUT IN AREAS OF OPPOSITION STRENGTH AND COMPLICATING </p><p>OBSERVER EFFORTS.  THE MERGER OF GOZ AND ZANU-PF STRUCTURES AND </p><p>FUNCTIONS, FROM DIRECT LOGISTICAL SUPPORT, TO CLEARLY BIASED </p><p>MEDIA CAMPAIGN COVERAGE, TO A SUBVERTED LEGAL REGIME, HAS </p><p>PROVIDED ADDITIONAL UNFAIR ADVANTAGE TO THE RULING PARTY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) SUMMARY CONTINUED:  FINALLY, CONTINUING VIOLENCE AND </p><p>WIDESPREAD INTIMIDATION AND HARASSMENT OF OPPOSITION LEADERS AND </p><p>SUPPORTERS BY ZANU-PF SUPPORTERS, AS WELL AS POLICE AND SOLDIERS, </p><p>HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY HAMPERED THE OPPOSITION\'S CAMPAIGN EFFORTS. </p><p>THE MDC COULD STILL EMERGE VICTORIOUS DESPITE THE SIGNIFICANTLY </p><p>UNEVEN PLAYING FIELD, BUT OVERCOMING ALL OF THE OBSTACLES PLACED </p><p>IN ITS WAY WILL REQUIRE A VERY LARGE VOTER TURNOUT.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>MINIMIZING OPPOSITION VOTER TURNOUT </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>3. (C) GOZ INTIMIDATION AND LOGISTICAL MANIPULATION WILL MINIMIZE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00693  01 OF 03  151036Z </p><p>TURNOUT IN URBAN AREAS, THE STRONGHOLD OF THE MDC.  THE GOZ HAS </p><p>ENGAGED IN A COMPREHENSIVE CAMPAIGN TO DISENFRANCHISE, EITHER </p><p>EXPLICITLY OR LOGISTICALLY, GREAT NUMBERS OF POTENTIAL OPPOSITION </p><p>SUPPORTERS. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) INTIMIDATION EFFORTS BY GOZ/ZANU-PF: </p><p>-- SPECIFIC EXAMPLES OF VIOLENCE COUPLED WITH THE PROPAGATION OF </p><p>THE IDEA THAT ZANU-PF CAN AND WILL TRACK DOWN THOSE WHO VOTE FOR </p><p>THE MDC, BY SUCH MEANS AS HIDDEN CAMERAS AND TRACKING THROUGH THE </p><p>BALLOT SERIAL NUMBER. </p><p> </p><p>--  HARASSMENT AT ROADBLOCKS AND IN NEIGHBORHOODS, DESIGNED TO </p><p>SHOW THE EXTENDED REACH OF WAR VETERANS AND YOUTH MILITIA. </p><p> </p><p>--  MILITIA SEIZURE OF NATIONAL IDENTIFICATION CARDS FROM </p><p>SUSPECTED MDC SYMPATHIZERS, DEPRIVING THEM OF SUFFRAGE. </p><p> </p><p>--  PROPAGATION OF THE IDEA THAT ZIMBABWE WILL EXPERIENCE CIVIL </p><p>WAR SHOULD THE MDC WIN.  THE RECENT ZDF LEADER\'S STATEMENT THAT </p><p>THE DEFENSE FORCES  WOULD ONLY ACCEPT AN INDEPENDENCE STRUGGLE </p><p>VETERAN AS PRESIDENT WAS A KEY PART OF THE STRATEGY. </p><p> </p><p>--  HARASSMENT OF PRIVATE MEDIA, INCLUDING THE FIREBOMBING OF THE </p><p>INDEPENDENT "DAILY NEWS" AND THE ARREST OF ITS EDITOR, DESIGNED </p><p>TO SQUELCH COVERAGE CRITICAL OF PRESIDENT MUGABE OR ZANU-PF. </p><p> </p><p>--  THE MURDER OF 31 MDC SUPPORTERS SINCE JANUARY 1, OUTLINING </p><p>THE POTENTIAL THREAT TO MDC SUPPORTERS OF VOICING THAT SUPPORT. </p><p> </p><p>--  IMMUNITY FROM ARREST AND PROSECUTION FOR THOSE WHO COMMIT THE </p><p>VIOLENCE FURTHER SUBSTANTIATES THAT WAR VETERANS AND YOUTH </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00693  01 OF 03  151036Z </p><p>MILITIA HAVE BEEN GIVEN FREE REIN. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) MANIPULATION OF VOTING LOGISTICS: </p><p> </p><p>--  THE SUPREME COURT AFFIRMED LAST WEEK THAT ZIMBABWEANS CAN </p><p>ONLY VOTE IN THEIR HOME CONSTITUENCIES.  CIVIL SOCIETY AND </p><p>OPPOSITION MONITORS AND OBSERVERS WILL BE FORCED TO CHOOSE </p><p>BETWEEN OBSERVING TO HELP MINIMIZE POSSIBLE VOTE FRAUD, AND </p><p>STAYING IN THEIR HOME DISTRICT TO VOTE THEMSELVES. </p><p> </p><p>--  MANY OF THE 80,000 CIVIL SERVANTS ASSIGNED DUTIES AS POLLING </p><p>OFFICERS WILL BE ASSIGNED OUTSIDE THEIR CONSTITUENCIES AND THUS </p><p>UNABLE TO VOTE. </p><p> </p><p>--  POLICE AND SOLDIERS ARE ALLOWED TO USE ABSENTEE BALLOTS,  BUT </p><p>REPORTEDLY HAVE BEEN FORCED TO FILL OUT BALLOTS IN THE PRESENCE </p><p>OF THEIR COMMANDING OFFICERS, WHO ARE PREDOMINANTLY SYMPATHETIC </p><p>TO THE RULING PARTY. </p><p> </p><p>--  THE NUMBER OF POLLING STATIONS IN URBAN AREAS (MDC </p><p>STRONGHOLDS) DECREASED BY APPROXIMATELY HALF IN COMPARISON TO THE </p><p>2000 ELECTION.  LINES AT THESE STATIONS WILL BE CORRESPONDINGLY </p><p>LONGER, POSSIBLY DISENFRANCHISING MANY. </p><p> </p><p>--  IN RURAL AREAS, WHERE ZANU-PF SUPPORT IS STRONGEST, THE </p><p>NUMBERS HAVE GREATLY INCREASED. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ6592 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  00693  02 OF 03  151036Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DINT-00  DODE-00 </p><p>      DOEE-00  DOTE-00  WHA-00   SRPP-00  DS-00    EAP-00   EB-00 </p><p>      OIGO-00  FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00 </p><p>      IO-00    LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   M-00     AC-01    NSAE-00 </p><p>      OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PC-01    PM-00    PRS-00 </p><p>      ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  EPAE-00 </p><p>      IIP-00   PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00 </p><p>      SAS-00   SWCI-00    /010W </p><p>                  ------------------75211C  151037Z /38 </p><p>R 151025Z MAR 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 1230 </p><p>INFO OAU COLLECTIVE </p><p>EU MEMBER STATES COLLECTIVE </p><p>AMEMBASSY OTTAWA </p><p>AMEMBASSY CANBERRA </p><p>NSC WASHDC </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 HARARE 000693 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>CAPE TOWN FOR A/S KANSTEINER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/06/07 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PINR, PHUM, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: ZIMBABWE\'S PRE-ELECTION ENVIRONMENT DEEPLY FLAWED </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  00693  02 OF 03  151036Z </p><p> </p><p>--  THE HARARE MAYORAL, MUNICIPAL COUNCIL, AND PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>ELECTIONS AND THE CHITUNGWIZE MAYORAL AND PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS </p><p>WILL ALL BE HELD MARCH 9-10, FURTHER COMPLICATING THE PROCESS. </p><p> </p><p>--  THE REGISTRAR GENERAL HAS DISTRIBUTED A SUPPLEMENTAL LIST TO </p><p>ALL POLLING STATIONS OF SUSPECTED DUAL NATIONALS WHO HAVE NOT </p><p>RENOUNCED FOREIGN CITIZENSHIP.  MANY OF THESE ALLEGED </p><p>DUAL NATIONALS ARE OF EUROPEAN OR ASIAN DESCENT, AND ARE </p><p>CONSIDERED TO BE STRONG MDC SUPPORTERS. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>COMPLICATING THE ELECTORAL PROCESS </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>6. (C) IN A WELL-ORGANIZED EFFORT THAT WE BELIEVE DELIBERATE, THE </p><p>GOZ HAS PROVIDED OPAQUE, OUTDATED, OR MISLEADING INFORMATION -- </p><p>WHEN THEY PROVIDED ANY INFORMATION AT ALL -- TO OPPOSITION </p><p>PARTY MEMBERS.  GOZ ATTEMPTS TO MANIPULATE THE OBSERVER PROCESS </p><p>IS DEFINED IN DETAIL REF E. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) INFORMATION CONTROL: </p><p> </p><p>--  AS LATE AS MARCH 7, LESS THAN 48 HOURS BEFORE THE </p><p>ELECTION, THE MDC STILL DID NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THE </p><p>UPDATED VOTERS ROLL. THE COPY PROVIDED TO THE MDC WAS </p><p>THE LIST AS OF JANUARY 27.  ONLY ZANU-PF HAS A COPY OF </p><p>THE FINAL VOTERS\' ROLL. </p><p> </p><p>--  THE LIST OF POLLING STATIONS\' LOCATIONS WAS NOT </p><p>PUBLISHED UNTIL MARCH 7. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00693  02 OF 03  151036Z </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) VOTER ROLL MANIPULATION: </p><p> </p><p>--  THE GOZ NOTED IN THE GAZETTE THAT THE DEADLINE FOR </p><p>REGISTRATION IN THE MARCH 9-10 ELECTION WAS JANUARY 27. </p><p> </p><p>--  ON MARCH 6, THE REGISTRAR GENERAL RETROACTIVELY EXTENDED THE </p><p>VOTER REGISTRATION DEADLINE TO MARCH 3. </p><p> </p><p>--  ZANU-PF, THEREFORE, HAS BEEN REGISTERING THOUSANDS OF </p><p>SUPPORTERS SINCE JANUARY 27. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>USING STATE STRUCTURES FOR POLITICAL GAIN </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>9. (C) THE GOZ, THROUGH OVERT COOPERATION WITH ZANU-PF STRUCTURES </p><p>AND ABUSE OF AN AUTHORITARIAN LEGAL REGIME, SEEKS TO KEEP THE </p><p>OPPOSITION OFF-BALANCE IN ITS CAMPAIGN EFFORTS.  THE GOZ WORKS ON </p><p>BEHALF OF ZANU-PF IN THREE WAYS.  FIRST, THE GOZ ALLOWS ZANU-PF </p><p>TO USE GOZ INFRASTRUCTURE IN CONDUCTING ITS ACTIVITY.  SECOND, </p><p>STATE-SPONSORED MEDIA HAS BEEN EXTREMELY ONE-SIDED IN ITS </p><p>COVERAGE OF THE ELECTION, INCLUDING PROVIDING LENGTHY AND LURID </p><p>COVERAGE OF AN ALLEGED ASSASSINATION PLOT.  THIRD, THE GOZ HAS </p><p>CREATED AN AUTHORITARIAN LEGAL ENVIRONMENT, WHICH LIMITS MDC </p><p>REDRESS. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) USE OF GOZ ASSETS: </p><p> </p><p>--  WE HAVE REGULARLY OBSERVED GOZ OFFICES AND VEHICLES </p><p>USED BY ZANU-PF FOR ELECTION ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING ARMY </p><p>JEEPS, PARASTATAL COMPANY BUSES, AND MUNICIPAL </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00693  02 OF 03  151036Z </p><p>DUMPTRUCKS. </p><p> </p><p>--  ZANU-PF IN SOME PLACES IS DISTRIBUTING THE GRAIN </p><p>MARKETING BOARD\'S MAIZE MEAL.  THOSE WITHOUT ZANU-PF </p><p>PARTY CARDS ARE NOT ABLE TO PURCHASE FOOD IN MANY </p><p>AREAS. </p><p> </p><p>--  ZDF OR POLICE OFTEN COMBINE WITH ZANU-PF YOUTH </p><p>MILITIA TO CONDUCT VIOLENCE AND INTIMIDATION. </p><p> </p><p>--  A LARGE NUMBER OF YOUTH MILITIA TERROR CAMPS HAVE BEEN </p><p>ESTABLISHED AT SCHOOLS AND OTHER GOVERNMENT PROPERTIES, BOTH FOR </p><p>TRAINING AND AS A SECURE LOCATION FOR ABDUCTIONS AND BEATINGS. </p><p> </p><p>--  GOZ ARMS CHARGED WITH ELECTION ACTIVITIES ARE THEMSELVES </p><p>HIGHLY PARTISAN.  THE ESC IS HEADED BY A RETIRED COLONEL AND HIS </p><p>DEPUTY IS A BRIGADIER WHO WENT ON LEAVE TWO MONTHS AGO. </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) BIASED MEDIA: </p><p> </p><p>--  DAILY NEWS BROADCASTS PROPAGATE THE STORY THAT THE MDC IS A </p><p>PUPPET OF WESTERN STATES. </p><p> </p><p>--  STATE MEDIA CLAIM THAT THE FOOD SHORTAGE IS A RESULT OF FOOD- </p><p>HOARDING BY WHITE FARMERS, IGNORING THE FACT THAT ONE OF THE </p><p>MAJOR CAUSES OF THE CURRENT FOOD SHORTAGE HAS BEEN THE DRASTIC </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ6590 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  00693  03 OF 03  151037Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  INL-00   DINT-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  DOEE-00  DOTE-00  WHA-00   SRPP-00  DS-00    EAP-00 </p><p>      EB-00    FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00 </p><p>      IO-00    LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   M-00     AC-01    NSAE-00 </p><p>      OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PC-01    PM-00    PRS-00 </p><p>      ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    IRM-00   STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00 </p><p>      R-00     EPAE-00  IIP-00   PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-02 </p><p>      G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00    /010W </p><p>                  ------------------752129  151037Z /38 </p><p>R 151025Z MAR 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 1231 </p><p>INFO OAU COLLECTIVE </p><p>EU MEMBER STATES COLLECTIVE </p><p>AMEMBASSY OTTAWA </p><p>AMEMBASSY CANBERRA </p><p>NSC WASHDC </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 HARARE 000693 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>CAPE TOWN FOR A/S KANSTEINER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/06/07 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PINR, PHUM, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: ZIMBABWE\'S PRE-ELECTION ENVIRONMENT DEEPLY FLAWED </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  00693  03 OF 03  151037Z </p><p> </p><p>REDUCTION OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION FOLLOWING THE STATE- </p><p>SANCTIONED LAND GRABS. </p><p> </p><p>--  STATE MEDIA HAVE BEEN IN A FRENZY OVER EVENTS SURROUNDING </p><p>TSVANGIRAI\'S ALLEGED ATTEMPT TO HIRE ARI BEN-MENASHE OF DICKENS & </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>MADSON TO ASSASSINATE PRESIDENT MUGABE. </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) ABUSE OF THE LEGAL APPARATUS: </p><p> </p><p>--  THE POLICE REGULARLY HAVE CITED THE PUBLIC ORDER AND SECURITY </p><p>ACT (POSA) AS AUTHORITY TO CANCEL PUBLIC EVENTS SCHEDULED BY THE </p><p>OPPOSITION MDC, INCLUDING CAMPAIGN RALLIES, AS WELL AS TWO </p><p>BRIEFINGS OF THE DIPLOMATIC COMMUNITY THIS WEEK (REFS A, B, C). </p><p> </p><p>--  PRESIDENT MUGABE HAS USED EXTENSIVE PRESIDENTIAL POWERS TO </p><p>OVERRULE SUPREME COURT DECISIONS ON IMPORTANT ELECTION ISSUES. </p><p>(I.E., THE COURT\'S JANUARY DECISION THAT HOLDING THE HARARE </p><p>MAYORAL, MUNICIPAL COUNCIL AND PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS </p><p>SIMULTANEOUSLY WAS ILLEGAL; AND THE COURT\'S FEBRUARY 27 DECISION </p><p>THAT PARLIAMENT ILLEGALLY PROMULGATED THE AMENDMENTS TO THE </p><p>ELECTORAL ACT). </p><p> </p><p>--  THE GOZ HAS ERODED THE INDEPENDENCE OF ITS JUDICIARY, TO </p><p>LIMIT THE OPPOSITION\'S OPTIONS FOR REDRESS TO OPPRESSIVE STATE </p><p>ACTION. </p><p> </p><p>--  THROUGH HARASSMENT OF JUSTICES AND APPOINTMENT OF ADDITIONAL </p><p>PRO-MUGABE JURISTS TO THE SUPREME COURT, MUGABE AND THE GOZ HAVE </p><p>REMOVED AN IMPORTANT CHECK ON GOZ AND ZANU-PF ACTION. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00693  03 OF 03  151037Z </p><p>--  A NUMBER OF ELECTION-RELATED MDC APPLICATIONS TO THE COURT </p><p>HAVE BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL, INCLUDING MDC CHALLENGES OF THE </p><p>CONTINUING VOTER REGISTRATION AND DEMANDING IMMEDIATE </p><p>RELEASE OF THE FINAL VOTER\'S ROLL. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>CONCLUSION </p><p>---------- </p><p>13. (C) REGARDLESS OF THE FINAL OUTCOME OF THESE ELECTIONS, THE </p><p>PROCESS HAS BEEN TAINTED SUCH THAT A FREE AND FAIR POLL CANNOT BE </p><p>ACHIEVED.  THE ZANU-PF GOALS IN THE PRE-ELECTION PERIOD WERE </p><p>FOCUSED ON SUPPRESSING MDC VOTER TURNOUT TO THE EXTENT THAT ZANU- </p><p>PF SUPPORTERS WOULD INDEED OUTNUMBER THEM ON THE POLLING DAYS. </p><p>DURING THE 2000 ELECTIONS, ZANU-PF MILITIA CONDUCTED A CAMPAIGN </p><p>OF INTIMIDATION DURING THE PRE-ELECTION PERIOD, FOLLOWED BY A </p><p>RELATIVELY PEACEFUL POLL.  THE GOZ THEN TRUMPETED REPORTS FROM </p><p>SHORT-TERM ELECTION-DAY OBSERVERS THAT THE PROCESS WAS CLEAN. </p><p>WE BELIEVE THAT THE GOZ AND ZANU-PF ARE FOLLOWING THAT SAME </p><p>SCRIPT IN THIS ELECTION. </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) SHOULD THE ZIMBABWE ELECTORATE TURN OUT AT AN EXTREMELY </p><p>HIGH LEVEL, THE MDC COULD STILL POSSIBLY WIN THE ELECTION. </p><p>RESULTS, PARTICULARLY FROM THE URBAN MDC STRONGHOLDS, SHOULD BE </p><p>AVAILABLE BY TUESDAY AFTERNOON, MARCH 12.  DELAYS BEYOND THAT </p><p>TIME WOULD BE A WORRYING DEVELOPMENT THAT WE BELIEVE COULD </p><p>INDICATE A GOZ ATTEMPT TO MANIPULATE THE COUNT. </p><p> </p><p>15. (C) POST BELIEVES THAT THE OPERATIONAL POINTS DESCRIBED ABOVE </p><p>ARE FAR TOO WIDESPREAD AND ORGANIZED TO BE SPONTANEOUS </p><p>EXPRESSIONS OF ZANU-PF SUPPORT, AS THE GOZ CLAIMS.  THESE YOUTH </p><p>MILITIAS, SUPPORTED BY STATE SECURITY FORCES, HAVE INSTILLED A </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00693  03 OF 03  151037Z </p><p>PALPABLE KAFKA-ESQUE FEAR IN MANY RURAL COMMUNITIES.  GIVEN THE </p><p>CHANGES TO THE LEGAL STRUCTURES, WE FIND IT HIGHLY UNLIKELY THAT </p><p>THE MDC WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL SHOULD IT SEEK RECOURSE IN THE </p><p>SUPREME COURT TO OVERTURN A TAINTED OR STOLEN ELECTION. </p><p> </p><p>THIS REPORT WAS COMPILED BY TDY REPORTING OFFICERS TROY FITRELL </p><p>AND AARON TARVER. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
