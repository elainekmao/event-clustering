(A) FBIS RESTON AFP20030707000114 </p><p> </p><p>     B. (B) FBIS RESTON FBIS RESTON 20030704000061 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: JOSEPH G. SULLIVAN FOR REASONS 1.5B/D </p><p> </p><p>1.(u) The GOZ and President Mugabe have sought to send out </p><p>several messages in advance of President Bush\'s visit to </p><p>Africa and anticipated pressure on the Mugabe regime.  The </p><p>state media, led by Information Minister Jonathan Moyo, has </p><p>dished out a steady stream of vitriol replete with </p><p>broad-gauge attacks on the US, racial slurs, criticism of the </p><p>US operation in Iraq, claims that the US was seeking African </p><p>resources or to prevent land redistribution to indigenous </p><p>Zimbabweans and arguments based on national sovereignty. </p><p>Mugabe sought to downplay the importance and risks for the </p><p>GOZ of President Bush\'s visit by telling a ZANU-PF Central </p><p>Committee meeting last Thursday that the USG would never </p><p>attempt what it had in Iraq (ref b).  But by Sunday, Mugabe </p><p>told a mystified rural crowd that President Bush and Prime </p><p>Minister Blair had lied on Iraq, were "liars" and "criminals" </p><p>and must stand before the International Court of Justice(ref </p><p>a).   He went on to say that President Bush was not welcome </p><p>in Africa if he sought to interfere in internal African </p><p>affairs, that South Africa would tell him that, and that </p><p>Mugabe supported those in South Africa who were protesting </p><p>President Bush\'s visit.  While this story was featured on </p><p>Sunday state television news, it had disappeared from </p><p>Monday\'s state radio and newspaper coverage, as if someone </p><p>had second thoughts about publicizing Mugabe\'s harsh language. </p><p> </p><p>2.(c)  The GOZ lines of defense are obvious: national </p><p>sovereignty, interference in African and Zimbabwean affairs, </p><p>and claims that the US is acting to prevent distribution of </p><p>land from white farmers to landless blacks.  We can preempt </p><p>these defenses by making the following points: </p><p> </p><p>-- the US seeks to give the Zimbabwean people the right to </p><p>choose its own leadership in free and fair elections, </p><p>something they were not given in the 2002 elections; </p><p> </p><p>-- the US defends the human and civil rights of all </p><p>Zimbabweans; it is the black majority which has suffered most </p><p>from human rights abuses and poor governance; </p><p> </p><p>-- the US has always supported land redistribution designed </p><p>to benefit Zimbabwe\'s poor, something the Mugabe regime\'s </p><p>land reform has not done; </p><p> </p><p>-- the Mugabe land redistribution and economic policies have </p><p>failed the basic test of governance by creating the </p><p>conditions in which Zimbabweans are no longer able to feed </p><p>themselves. </p><p> </p><p>In response to the corollary point made by the GOZ and some </p><p>South Africans that Zimbabweans    must be left to solve </p><p>their problems themselves, the counter is that </p><p> </p><p>-- the GOZ and ZANU-PF have declined to engage in any serious </p><p>dialogue since initially agreeing to an agenda for dialogue </p><p>in May of 2002. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
