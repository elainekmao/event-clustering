<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 001113 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF/W, AF/EPS AND EB/TPP </p><p>SATE PASS USTR PCOLEMAN </p><p>TASHKENT FOR BURKHALTER </p><p>COMMERCE FOR ITA/MAC </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, PGOV, PREL, NI, USTR </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIAN GOVERNMENT DEFENDS IMPORT BANS </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p>1. In June 9 and 10 meetings with Nigerian officials, </p><p>Assistant U.S. Trade Representative for Africa Florie </p><p>Liser and USTR Director for African Affairs Patrick </p><p>Coleman highlighted U.S. concern with the expansion of </p><p>Nigeria\'s import bans and its frequently changing </p><p>tariff schedules. With the exception of the Ministry </p><p>of Commerce, GON officials defended the bans, claiming </p><p>they were the only route to increasing domestic </p><p>agricultural and manufacturing production. </p><p>Unfortunately, this protectionist mind-set is gaining </p><p>currency, and convincing the GON to reverse its </p><p>illiberal trade policy will be difficult. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>USTR Message </p><p>------------ </p><p>2. In June 9 meetings with officials from the Office </p><p>of the President, Ministry of Commerce, Ministry of </p><p>Industry, and Ministry of Finance, Assistant U.S. </p><p>Trade Representative for Africa Florie Liser and USTR </p><p>Director for Africa Patrick Coleman highlighted U.S. </p><p>concern with a growing list of Nigerian import bans </p><p>and fluctuating tariff schedules. In particular, Liser </p><p>cited textiles and apparel, ice cream, fruit juices, </p><p>poultry, and mosquito netting as key areas. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. In addition to constraining U.S. exports, Nigeria\'s </p><p>inconsistent trade policy was also diluting U.S. </p><p>investors\' interest in the country, Liser noted. </p><p>Investors seek a stable regulatory environment; trade </p><p>bans and fluid tariff schedules make investors fear </p><p>they might not be able to import inputs required for </p><p>their investment, she cautioned. Liser also pointed </p><p>out that the bans were inconsistent with Nigeria\'s WTO </p><p>commitments. She suggested WTO-consistent tariffs that </p><p>earn revenue for the government would be a better way </p><p>to provide some protection for domestic industry. She </p><p>pointed out that many of the banned goods continue to </p><p>be smuggled into the country across Nigeria\'s overland </p><p>borders. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. Liser also pushed Nigerian officials to encourage </p><p>their National Assembly to pass legislation making </p><p>Nigeria eligible for AGOA textile and apparel </p><p>benefits. She said other African countries were </p><p>creating thousands of jobs due to AGOA and that </p><p>Nigeria\'s window of opportunity would soon close. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Ministry of Commerce </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>5. Liser met Director of the Ministry of Commerce </p><p>External Trade Department Fred Agah and other members </p><p>of his staff. Agah explained that in the 1970s, </p><p>Nigeria sought to use oil revenues to build a self- </p><p>sufficient economy through import substitution and </p><p>large projects to produce steel, paper, aluminum, </p><p>petrochemicals, and other goods. He said the collapse </p><p>of oil prices in the 1980s forced successive </p><p>governments to abandon these projects. Subsequently, </p><p>an IMF structural adjustment program in the late 1980s </p><p>focused on demand reduction completed the shift from </p><p>an economy based on production to one based on </p><p>speculation, according to Agah. He said imports </p><p>skyrocketed, and in response the government imposed </p><p>import bans on as many as 3,000 products by the early </p><p>1990s. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. Agah said there had been some progress eliminating </p><p>trade barriers and claimed few remained. He pointed to </p><p>Nigeria\'s 2002 trade policy documents as evidence of </p><p>an overall commitment to trade liberalization. </p><p>However, Agah explained that a command and control </p><p>approach to economic policy still existed among </p><p>government leadership. That approach, coupled with </p><p>demands from politically influential domestic </p><p>producers, meant that trade barriers on certain goods </p><p>would be around for some time. Agah acknowledged the </p><p>negative impact the bans had on investment, both </p><p>domestic and foreign, but said that his Ministry was </p><p>essentially powerless on the issue. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. On AGOA, Agah said both Houses had passed </p><p>legislation to strengthen the trans-shipment penalty, </p><p>a change necessary to Nigeria\'s eligibility for AGOA </p><p>apparel benefits. He said the National Assembly would </p><p>send the bill to the President for signature after </p><p>harmonizing the Senate and House versions. Agah blamed </p><p>the United States for the delay in getting the </p><p>legislation through, saying that we were not </p><p>consistent in providing information on what provisions </p><p>were necessary to make Nigeria eligible for apparel </p><p>benefits. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. Agah requested information on our positions on key </p><p>issues within the Doha round of WTO negotiations. He </p><p>understood our basic proposals, but wanted to know the </p><p>issues on which we would be amenable to compromise and </p><p>those on which our position is non-negotiable. Agah </p><p>claimed this knowledge would help Nigeria better </p><p>support us on areas where Nigeria and the United </p><p>States have common interests. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. In response to an inquiry from Liser, Agah said a </p><p>U.S.-Nigeria TIFA in early July would not be feasible. </p><p>Agah noted that a Minister likely would not have been </p><p>confirmed by then, so he proposed postponing the </p><p>meeting until September. Liser agreed to coordinate </p><p>with Washington to fix a date. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Ambassador\'s Luncheon </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>10. Ambassador Jeter hosted a luncheon for Nigerian </p><p>officials where--in addition to discussion of broader </p><p>issues such as poverty alleviation and corruption-- </p><p>Liser made her key points on trade policy </p><p>inconsistency and AGOA eligibility. At the lunch were </p><p>Head of the President\'s National Price Intelligence </p><p>Committee Oby Ezekwesili, Director General of the </p><p>Bureau of Public Enterprises Nasir El-Rufai, Former </p><p>Chief Economic Advisor Magnus Kpakol (now Special </p><p>Advisor on Poverty Alleviation), and Special Advisor </p><p>to the Vice President for Economic Affairs Hamilton O. </p><p>Isu. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. Kpakol attempted to defend the import bans and </p><p>tariff increases saying that they were relatively few </p><p>and were necessary to supporting domestic production. </p><p>He aknowledged Liser\'s point that in some cases the </p><p>bans protected only one manufacturer, but insisted </p><p>that the bans were part of a well-considered plan to </p><p>promote domestic manufacturing capacity. (Comment: </p><p>Last year, Kpakol was a free trader and an ally-- </p><p>although often ineffective--in our attempts to tilt </p><p>the GON toward greater trade liberalization. However, </p><p>he appears fully converted to the protectionist </p><p>congregation. His conversion eliminates a formerly </p><p>reformist voice from within senior policy circles. It </p><p>also demonstrates the strength of the protectionists </p><p>within the GON. End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Ministry of Finance </p><p>------------------- </p><p>12. At the Ministry of Finance, Liser met Director for </p><p>Budget Implementation, Monitoring, and Evaluation C. </p><p>D. Gali and Director for Fiscal Policy Haliru Aliyu. </p><p>Gali said import bans were counterproductive because </p><p>they were impossible to enforce and brought in no </p><p>tariff revenue. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. Aliyu disagreed, saying buyers preferred imports </p><p>over local goods. Because there is local production, </p><p>he cited toothpicks, water, biscuits, and textiles as </p><p>"needless imports."  Aliyu added that there was </p><p>"nothing really permanent" about the bans. On mosquito </p><p>netting, Aliyu said he recently met netting </p><p>manufacturers who claimed they are overstocked with </p><p>yarn. He concluded there was therefore no need to </p><p>import mosquito netting, since local manufacturing </p><p>capacity was underutilized. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Ministry of Industry </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>14. Ministry of Industry Permanent Secretary Haruni </p><p>Sanusi and his staff also received Liser\'s trade </p><p>policy message. Sanusi explained that Nigeria\'s </p><p>industrial policy is to use trade policy to protect </p><p>domestic industry. He said bans were necessary to </p><p>encourage growth and allow domestic goods to gain </p><p>market share. He pointed to fruit juice as one example </p><p>of a ban that was successful in building sales for a </p><p>local producer. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15. Sanusi acknowledged that smuggling was a problem </p><p>but insisted that stronger enforcement effort would </p><p>all but eliminate smuggling. He said the bans were </p><p>temporary and more may follow, but insisted they would </p><p>be closely monitored to assess their impact. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Ministry of Agriculture </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>16. On June 10, Patrick Coleman met Ministry of </p><p>Agriculture Permanent Secretary O. A. Idachi and staff </p><p>to discuss trade policy. Idachi insisted the bans were </p><p>important to food security in Nigeria. He said Nigeria </p><p>hoped to be a net food exporter again, and recognized </p><p>that agricultural development was key to poverty </p><p>alleviation. Idachi identified several priorities for </p><p>Nigeria: rice, vegetable oil, and livestock. He said </p><p>trade policy would be used to protect domestic </p><p>production in those areas. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>17. Idachi\'s staff said trade policy was the only tool </p><p>available to protect Nigerian farmers from intense </p><p>competition from developed countries that subsidize </p><p>their farmers. They complained trade liberalization </p><p>only benefits developed countries. Coleman countered </p><p>that USTR\'s position was to eliminate export subsidies </p><p>and greatly reduce domestic support in the Doha round. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>18. Economic growth and industrialization based on </p><p>import substitution, a development strategy that has </p><p>failed more often than it has worked, has become </p><p>policy in Nigeria. Without question, Nigeria has great </p><p>economic potential. It possesses abundant natural </p><p>resources and a large domestic market. That potential </p><p>has been underutilized thus far. Instead of </p><p>identifying internal structural flaws that obstruct </p><p>domestic production, the GON has decided to blame </p><p>unfair international competition, a convenient fall </p><p>guy. This sentiment is held not only by those in </p><p>government, but many people in society. Ask an average </p><p>Nigerian about the recent ban on fruit juice, and they </p><p>will answer "why should we import what we can make at </p><p>home?" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>19. This nationalistic sentiment, however, does not </p><p>duly consider economic realities nor the negative </p><p>impact on the consumer. Some goods--such as fruit </p><p>juice--are in short supply because domestic producers </p><p>cannot meet demand. Consumers now have no choice but </p><p>to purchase inferior quality goods. Meanwhile, </p><p>investors who could help local manufacturers build </p><p>capacity or improve quality hold their money outside </p><p>Nigeria, fearing that trade or other economic policy </p><p>will change again abruptly putting them on the wrong </p><p>side of a trade barrier. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>20. Given the relatively strong consensus for the </p><p>import substitution strategy, Nigeria will not likely </p><p>turn from its protectionist course very quickly. In </p><p>fact, additional items will probably be added to the </p><p>prohibited list in the months to come. However, we </p><p>hope that our harping and the patent ineffectiveness </p><p>of the protectionist approach will, sooner rather than </p><p>later, cause the GON to enter into a new romance with </p><p>trade liberalization. End Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
