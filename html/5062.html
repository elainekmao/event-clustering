(SBU) SUMMARY.  Nigeria should endure no economic </p><p>losses due to the decision of the ICJ awarding the </p><p>Bakassi Peninsula to Cameroon.  Despite speculation of </p><p>vast crude reserves offshore, several existing oil </p><p>wells in the waters impacted by the decision appear to </p><p>be non-producing and there is little expectation of </p><p>significant production from the disputed region in the </p><p>near future.  Further, there is virtually no other </p><p>economic activity associated with the peninsula beyond </p><p>fishing and farming. Meanwhile, there are social and </p><p>political reasons for the ongoing attention paid to the </p><p>ruling in the Nigerian press.  A recently formed joint </p><p>commission may resolve Nigeria\'s post-judgment </p><p>reservations by establishing a timetable for the phased </p><p>withdrawal of Nigerian troops from the peninsula.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) In mid-November, Econoffs met with </p><p>representatives of ExxonMobil to discuss the economic </p><p>impact of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) </p><p>ruling which essentially granted Cameroon possession of </p><p>the Bakassi Peninsula. The company\'s representatives </p><p>referred to maps drawn for ExxonMobil after the ICJ </p><p>decision indicating new lines of demarcation associated </p><p>with the ruling.  The ruling delineates territorial </p><p>waters offshore for each country.  From the maps Exxon- </p><p>Mobil showed us, it appears that Nigeria retains most </p><p>of the offshore territory that it originally claimed, </p><p>as only a relatively small, well-defined area of water </p><p>near Bakassi was claimed by both parties.  Because the </p><p>islands of Equatorial Guinea rest in the Gulf near both </p><p>Nigeria and Cameroon, there is not enough distance </p><p>between these countries\' shorelines to create </p><p>international waters.  Because of the remoteness of the </p><p>region and the direction of the offshore boundary drawn </p><p>by the ICJ, the ruling should have no effect on </p><p>shipping lanes or any port access for either country. </p><p>Likewise, existing agreements between Nigeria and </p><p>Equatorial Guinea, and between Nigeria and Sao Tome and </p><p>Principe should not be affected by the ruling, although </p><p>recently renewed attention is being paid to each for </p><p>strategic and development reasons. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Cameroon began exploring and developing oil </p><p>fields in the Bight of Bonny in the 1980s.  It was </p><p>thought the waters held the promise of fantastic </p><p>returns on investment, but this has not been borne out. </p><p>The court claims over Bakassi began in 1994, with </p><p>Nigeria and Cameroon each claiming an arc of water </p><p>extending out from the peninsula in its respective </p><p>favor.  According to the maps published by the court </p><p>and others produced for ExxonMobil, the ICJ ruling </p><p>chose neither\'s claimed offshore boundary, but rather </p><p>drew a new boundary line.  Ten oil wells exist in the </p><p>main zone that fell between the Nigerian and </p><p>Cameroonian claimed lines, all developed by Cameroon </p><p>and, as a result of the ICJ ruling, now resting within </p><p>Cameroonian territory.  It appears that none are </p><p>producing, and four or five may be dry.  An additional </p><p>ten wells exist in other waters claimed by Cameroon and </p><p>one Cameroonian well now falls within Nigerian </p><p>territory, but it too appears to be non-producing.  The </p><p>company representatives do not believe there are </p><p>significant onshore oil deposits at Bakassi. This </p><p>belief was also expressed by ExxonMobil\'s VP for Africa </p><p>in a separate conversation with the Ambassador. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) One field that now straddles both countries\' </p><p>boundaries is producing oil at a varying rate up to </p><p>40,000 barrels per day (bpd) from a well on the </p><p>Nigerian side of the new boundary. The ExxonMobil </p><p>representatives speculate that development rights to </p><p>this field will be negotiated between the countries, </p><p>akin to the Nigeria - Sao Tome and Principe Joint </p><p>Development Zone (N-STP JDZ) farther west in the Gulf </p><p>of Guinea, or the border agreement between Nigeria and </p><p>Equatorial Guinea. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) During a November visit to Calabar, Econoff was </p><p>informed that very little non-oil economic activity </p><p>exists in and around the Bakassi Peninsula.  The people </p><p>of Bakassi live in small villages and subsist mostly by </p><p>fishing from small wooden boats resembling long canoes </p><p>rowed into the Bight of Bonny.  There is no organized </p><p>fishing industry in the region. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) While in south-east Nigeria, Econoff attended a </p><p>conference in Akwa Ibom state in which the Bakassi </p><p>ruling was addressed in a question and answer session </p><p>following a presentation on environmental issues.  Some </p><p>anger over the loss of Bakassi was voiced by the </p><p>audience of approximately 1500, and it was asserted </p><p>that roughly 75 percent of the Nigerians now living in </p><p>Bakassi are of Akwa Ibom origin. Population estimates </p><p>range from 30,000 to 300,000, with anything over </p><p>100,000 improbable. Beyond expressing a sense of </p><p>solidarity with their kin, conference participants </p><p>conjectured that if many Bakassi residents chose to </p><p>return to Akwa Ibom state, the repatriation would be </p><p>very taxing on the state\'s infrastructure and its </p><p>communities\' social structures, which will necessitate </p><p>a repatriation plan and funding from the federal </p><p>government. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) Although definitely a minority, some economic </p><p>editorialists and private sector consultants have </p><p>opined that the ICJ ruling provides an overall economic </p><p>benefit to Nigeria.  They note that while Cameroon was </p><p>awarded the land territory of Bakassi and disputed </p><p>areas around Lake Chad, it did not win the offshore </p><p>boundary lines it sought.  Some analysts further </p><p>speculate that the territory maintained by Nigeria as a </p><p>result of the ICJ ruling holds more than 10 billion </p><p>barrels of crude oil, especially at its boundary with </p><p>Equatorial Guinea.  Because there is now a ruling by an </p><p>international body delineating an offshore boundary, </p><p>and that boundary is not detrimental to Nigeria\'s long- </p><p>term economic interests, the political risk in the </p><p>region is substantially reduced.  With reduced </p><p>political risk, private firms may develop the region </p><p>with confidence that the concessions they negotiate </p><p>with one country or the other will be secure. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) Several international oil company executives </p><p>told Econoff that they nonetheless remain reluctant to </p><p>explore or develop the region until all public </p><p>controversy has abated and a mutually satisfactory </p><p>understanding between the countries is achieved. </p><p>ExxonMobil officials deduce that if Nigeria ever </p><p>believed that the oil reserves off Bakassi were </p><p>commercially exploitable, it would have drilled in the </p><p>region from 1994 to the present as Cameroon did. Given </p><p>that most of the wells already drilled in the disputed </p><p>region are dry or non-producing, and the GON has told </p><p>the oil companies they should not expect increases in </p><p>development funds in the 2003 budget, there seems to be </p><p>little incentive to begin or expand serious development </p><p>in the waters off Bakassi in the near future. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU) COMMENT: Some media reports speculated that </p><p>Obasanjo had miscalculated regarding the outcome of the </p><p>case.  However, Mission interaction with GON decision- </p><p>makers in advance of the ruling and after it was </p><p>announced indicates that the GON was aware the ICJ </p><p>likely would award Bakassi to Cameroon.  Given the </p><p>years-long drumbeat of "Bakassi is Nigerian," the GON </p><p>could not take steps to prepare its people in the weeks </p><p>immediately before the ruling was announced.   Rather, </p><p>the GON had to await the ruling, gauge the level of </p><p>public unhappiness, and respond accordingly. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU) COMMENT CONTINUED:  Although "oil-rich" is </p><p>the modifier placed in front of virtually every mention </p><p>of the word "Bakassi" in the Nigerian media, pundits do </p><p>not focus on resources or access to the Cross River\'s </p><p>deepwater channel.  Rather, journalists emphasize on </p><p>the sufferings of individuals at the hands of </p><p>Cameroonian gendarmes and the essential principle of </p><p>national integrity and indivisibility.  Bakassi must be </p><p>Nigerian, the theme goes, because its inhabitants </p><p>always were, are and ever will be Nigerian, and it is </p><p>the duty of a government to protect the interests of </p><p>its citizens.  In short, no matter how much discussion </p><p>there may be about natural resources, Nigeria\'s </p><p>interest in retaining control of Bakassi is founded not </p><p>on economic interests or even concerns about its naval </p><p>vessels being able to reach the Port of Calabar but </p><p>rather on a mixture of national pride and concern for </p><p>the fate of the peninsula\'s inhabitants. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  (SBU) With the approach of the April presidential </p><p>election, opposition candidates may try to use the ICJ </p><p>ruling to embarrass the Obasanjo administration.  A </p><p>Nigerian-Cameroonian commission, facilitated by the UN </p><p>Secretary General, has been formed to attempt to </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>resolve Nigerian concerns over the ICJ ruling.  The </p><p>commission held its first meeting in Yaounde in early </p><p>December, but an agreement on any substantive point </p><p>likely awaits the post-election period, as the </p><p>President cannot to make any concession before voters </p><p>go to the pools; thereafter, he can move but may still </p><p>proceed very deliberately, in order to put this issue </p><p>to rest without provoking new outcry. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HINSON-JONES </p><p></p></div>
