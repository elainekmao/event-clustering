<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN 1399 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS: PGOV XX </p><p>SUBJECT: SULTAN OF BRUNEI STRIKES TWO MORE RAPID BLOWS AT </p><p>ISLAMIZATION </p><p> </p><p>REF: BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN 1379 </p><p> </p><p>1. CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT </p><p> </p><p>2. AS REPORTED REFTEL THE SULTAN OF BRUNEI BOYCOTTED </p><p>ACTIVITIES MARKING THE PROPHET\'S BIRTHDAY ON NOV 25 IN </p><p>ANGER AT THE ORGANIZING COMMITTEE HAVING INTRODUCED </p><p>SEPARATION OF THE SEXES AT THE CELEBRATION. EVEN THOUGH THE </p><p>DECISION TO SEPARATE THE SEXES WAS REVERSED, NO MEMBER OF THE </p><p>ROYAL FAMILY PARTICIPATED. WHILE THE SHOCK WAVES FROM THIS </p><p>CONTRETEMPS WERE STILL REVERBERATING AROUND BRUNEI THE SULTAN </p><p>TOOK TWO MORE STEPS TO UNDO INNOVATIONS INTRODUCED BY </p><p>ISLAMIC CONSERVATIVES. </p><p> </p><p>3. ON NOV 27, WITHOUT ANY PRIOR WARNING, NEWSCASTERS ON </p><p>RADIO TELEVISION BRUNEI (RTB) APPEARED WITHOUT HEAD </p><p>COVERING. THE PRACTICE OF HAVING NEWSCASTERS WEAR HEAD </p><p>COVERING, THE WOMEN TIGHT-FITTING SCARVES THAT FASTEN </p><p>UNDER THE CHIN AND MEN THE TRADITIONAL MALAY SONGKOK, WAS </p><p>GRADUALLY INTRODUCED OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS; AND IT HAD </p><p>BEEN ABOUT A YEAR SINCE ANY FEMALE APPEARED ON THE </p><p>TELEVISION NEWS WITH UNCOVERED HEAD. SINCE NOV 27 HEAD </p><p>COVERINGS HAVE COMPLETELY DISAPPEARED, AND IT IS NOW WIDELY </p><p>KNOWN THAT A WRITTEN ORDER BANNING HEAD COVERING WAS ISSUED </p><p>BY PRINCE JEFRI, WHO AS MINISTER OF CULTURE, YOUTH AND SPORTS </p><p>IS RESPONSIBLE FOR TELEVISION, AND THAT THE ORDER HAD BEEN </p><p>CLEARED WITH THE SULTAN. (THE ORDER ALMOST CERTAINLY </p><p>ORIGINATED WITH THE SULTAN). </p><p> </p><p>4. NEXT, ON NOV 30, IT WAS ANNOUNCED ONT HE EVENING TELEVISION </p><p>NEWS THAT, BY COMMAND OF THE SULTAN AND EFFECTIVE THE FOLLOWING </p><p>DAY, THE BRUNEI GOVERNMENT OFFICE OF INFORMATION WAS ABOLISHED </p><p>AS A SEPARATE ENTITY AND ITS FUNCTIONS TRANSFERRED TO A </p><p>JOINT BROADCASTING/INFORMATION DEPARTMENT TO BE HEADED BY RTB </p><p>DIRECTOR PENGIRAN BADARRUDIN AND THAT THE LIKE-NAMED PEHIN </p><p>BADARRUDIN, HEAD OF THE INFORMATION DEPARTMENT, WAS TRANS- </p><p>FERRED BACK TO THE RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS DEPARTMENT. THUS </p><p>BROADCASTING AND INFORMATION WERE RESTORED TO THE SITUATION </p><p>THAT EXISTED PRIOR TO THE FORMATION OF A SEPARATE INFORMATION </p><p>DEPARTMENT, WHICH UNDER PEHIN BADARRUDIN WAS WELL KNOWN FOR </p><p>ITS VIGOROUS DISSEMINATION OF RELIGIOUSLY CONSERVATIVE </p><p>VIEWPOINTS, WITH THE DEPARTMENT EDITED GOVERNMENT INFORMATION </p><p>BULLETIN HAVING BECOME A MOUTHPIECE FOR THE MUFTI OF BRUNEI. </p><p>THE INFORMATION FUNCTION NOW COMES UNDER THE CONTROL OF </p><p>A MAN WHO IS ANATHEMA TO RELIGIOUS CONSERVATIVES. </p><p> </p><p>5. COMMENT: IF THERE WAS DOUBT IN ANYONE\'S MIND THAT </p><p>THE SULTAN\'S INTENT WAS TO STRIKE A BLOW AT CREEPING </p><p>ISLAMIZATION, THAT DOUBT HAS NOW BEEN DISPELLED. BY </p><p>MOVING QUICKLY TO UNDO TWO OF THE MOST VISIBLE SIGNS OF </p><p>ISLAMIZATION IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE HUMILIATION OF THE </p><p>ORGANIZERS OF THE PROPHET\'S BIRTHDAY CELEBRATIONS, INCLUDING </p><p>MOST NOTABLY MINISTER OF HEALTH AND EDUCATION ABDUL AZIZ, </p><p>THE SULTAN CAUGHT THE PROPONENTS OF ISLAMIZATION AT A </p><p>WEEK MOMENT. THE EMBASSY REGARDS THIS AS A WELL EXECUTED </p><p>MANEUVER ON THE SULTAN\'S PART, IF SUCCESSFUL,  A HEALTHY </p><p>DEVELOPMENT FOR BRUNEI. THERE MAY STILL, OF COURSE, BE </p><p>SOME REACTION, WHICH COUL CENTER AROUND THE SULTAN\'S </p><p>FATHER WHEN HE RETURNS FROM MEDICAL TREATMENT IN ENGLAND; </p><p>BUT THE STATE OF THE SERI BEGAWAN\'S PHYSICAL AND MENTAL </p><p>HEALTH MAKE IT QUESTIONABLE THAT HE COULD LEAD A SUSTAINED </p><p>CAMPAIGN IN FAVOR OF GREATER ISLAMIZATION. </p><p> </p><p>6. THE ADVOCATES OF ISLAMIC FUNDEMENTALISM IN BRUNEI, </p><p>INSPIRED BY EXAMPLES FROM ELSEWHERE IN THE ISLAMIC </p><p>WORLD, APPARENTLY FORGOT IN THEIR ZEAL TO SERVE GOD THAT </p><p>THEY HAD NEGLECTED TO CONSULT CAESAR. </p><p> </p><p>KING </p><p></p></div>
