<p>UNCLAS  ZAGREB 001756 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EUR/SCE (NARDI) AND EUR/ACE (HANSEN, ROBERTS) </p><p>DEPARTMENT PASS TO USAID FOR EE/ECA (FARNSWORTH, CONVERY) </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAID, PGOV, HR, Political Parties/Elections </p><p>SUBJECT: USAID-FUNDED PRE-ELECTION ACTIVITIES DELIVERING </p><p>POSITIVE RESULTS </p><p> </p><p>REF: ZAGREB 913 </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  Croatia has made important progress on reforms since the </p><p>elections in January 2000 brought an end to the nationalist </p><p>regime of former President Tudjman\'s HDZ party.  But this </p><p>progress is fragile, and if the next parliamentary elections </p><p>result in a government that is not committed to continuing </p><p>these reforms, it could stall Croatia\'s movement toward </p><p>accession into Euro-Atlantic institutions, a key USG goal for </p><p>regional stability in Southeast Europe. </p><p> </p><p>2.  One of the challenges to the USG\'s SEED-funded democratic </p><p>governance assistance programs is to ensure the reform </p><p>process in Croatia continues by helping reform-oriented </p><p>political parties succeed.  To do this, USAID implementers </p><p>are directed to assist parties in crafting messages that </p><p>explain to voters how continued progress on reform is in </p><p>their interest and also to appeal directly to citizens to </p><p>participate in the electoral process.  This strategy is </p><p>working.  Recent USAID-sponsored polls show that, with </p><p>elections expected in late November 2003, it is likely that a </p><p>coalition of reform-oriented political parties will be able </p><p>to form a government committed to a progressive agenda.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Political Environment for Assistance </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3.  Expectations of voters following the elections that </p><p>brought Croatia\'s first coalition government to power in </p><p>January 2000 were unrealistically high.  Popular support for </p><p>coalition parties began to slip when voters realized that it </p><p>would take time for some reforms to show results.  The </p><p>results of local-level elections held in May 2001 confirmed </p><p>this, and coalition party leaders were stunned by the strong </p><p>showing of the nationalist, right-wing HDZ.  USAID assistance </p><p>programs implemented mainly by grantees National Democratic </p><p>Institute and International Republic Institute are intended </p><p>to help reform-oriented parties explain their successes and </p><p>the benefits of remaining on the reform path. </p><p> </p><p>NDI Assistance </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  NDI\'s program works on political party training, both at </p><p>the central and local level.  Croatia\'s current leadership </p><p>has been frustrated by the public\'s persistent belief that </p><p>there has been no progress toward making good on campaign </p><p>promises.  NDI is working with the leading coalition party to </p><p>develop a communications strategy which explains the </p><p>government\'s achievements over the past three years.  In </p><p>addition to its training program for members of Parliament, </p><p>NDI is also helping parties develop better strategies to </p><p>reach out directly to constituents. </p><p> </p><p>5.  During the campaign which brought the current coalition </p><p>to government, NDI encouraged the development of a citizen </p><p>action NGO, GONG.  This NGO now serves as a sub-grantee </p><p>supported by NDI to carry out a range of pre-election </p><p>activities to get out the vote, especially important for </p><p>strengthening the momentum for reform.  GONG also holds </p><p>"citizen hours" in communities around Croatia to bring </p><p>citizens into direct contact with their elected officials at </p><p>all levels.  Response to this program has been excellent, and </p><p>has enjoyed participation from all political levels, </p><p>including President Mesic. </p><p> </p><p>IRI Assistance </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  IRI assistance has had the highest public profile since </p><p>it works not only with political party spokespeople but with </p><p>journalists as well.  IRI\'s in-depth political polling has </p><p>become invaluable to reform-oriented political parties as </p><p>they make their appeals to voters.  Top U.S. political </p><p>analysts help parties decide -- using extensive polls -- </p><p>which campaign issues will be most resonant with voters and </p><p>then help parties develop messages which will encourage </p><p>voters to continue to support reform-oriented parties. </p><p> </p><p>7.  IRI completed its second in a series of three polls in </p><p>late June 2003.  The first poll served as a "wake-up call" to </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>coalition parties who began -- finally -- to heed advice of </p><p>U.S. consultants.  They took responsibility for not </p><p>fulfilling voter expectations, and then began to </p><p>systematically explain their government\'s achievements of the </p><p>past three years.  Coalition political leaders have focused </p><p>on issues they knew (based on poll results) resonated with </p><p>voters, like improving the tourism industry, transportation </p><p>infrastructure and making progress toward membership in the </p><p>EU.  The second IRI poll shows that this message is getting </p><p>through and that support for coalition parties is increasing. </p><p> </p><p>8.  U.S. analysts presented the data to the senior levels of </p><p>Croatia\'s leading political parties.  They explained the </p><p>poll\'s most significant results: the coalition-leading SDP </p><p>has begun to gain ground on the opposition HDZ, which has </p><p>become stagnant.  Undecided voters have begun to lean toward </p><p>coalition parties, and the key indicator, the number of </p><p>respondents who think the Government is leading Croatia in </p><p>the "right direction," is on the rise. </p><p> </p><p>9.  The poll showed that the majority of undecided voters -- </p><p>still over twenty percent -- are women or younger voters, the </p><p>natural constituency of reform-oriented parties.  The </p><p>opposition-leading HDZ has not branched out from its core </p><p>constituents of older, less-educated, rural voters and the </p><p>percentage of undecided voters who declared that they would </p><p>never vote for the HDZ is high.  The bottom line, according </p><p>to IRI analysts, is that a return of a coalition similar to </p><p>the current lineup of political parties and excluding the HDZ </p><p>is very likely. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  We are pleased that coalition parties took the advice of </p><p>our USAID-funded experts and also that the advice had such </p><p>immediate and positive results.  Coalition party leaders have </p><p>become confident that they will return to government after </p><p>elections in November, but we continue to warn against </p><p>complacency.  We will continue to urge reform-minded parties </p><p>to focus their message on how continued progress on reforms </p><p>will help them achieve their long-term goals. </p><p>FRANK </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p></p></div>
