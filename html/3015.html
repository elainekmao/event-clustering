<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 001593 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF/W, AF/RSA, PM </p><p>OSD FOR NELSON </p><p>LAGOS FOR HINSON-JONES, GREANEY, CASS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: 5/8/12 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MASS, PHUM, EAID, KHDP, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: ARMY MINISTER ON RONCO, BENUE, </p><p>TRAVEL TO WASHINGTON </p><p> </p><p>REF: A.) STATE 79557, B.) LAGOS 927, C.) ABUJA 1193 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER; REASONS 1.5 </p><p>(D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: During a May 2 meeting with the </p><p>Ambassador, Minister of State for Defense (Army) Lawal </p><p>Batagarawa said he planned to visit Washington on May </p><p>24 to meet with human rights NGOs, USG officials and </p><p>the Hill. Impressed by the accomplishments of </p><p>Operation Avid Recovery, he agreed help identify two </p><p>people as points of contact for RONCO in Abuja and </p><p>Lagos. Batagarawa added that he would try to help </p><p>RONCO as much as possible. Ambassador Jeter was </p><p>accompanied by PolMilOff, and Batagarawa by his </p><p>Special Assistant, Balarabe Lawal.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>============ </p><p>BENUE UPDATE </p><p>============ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Unable to travel to Washington in late April as </p><p>initially planned, Batagarawa now hoped to leave Abuja </p><p>May 24 for the U.S. (this has now been shifted to May </p><p>26).  The main purpose of the trip would be to give an </p><p>update on the GON investigation into the communal </p><p>violence in the Middle Belt, especially the violence </p><p>in Benue last October when soldiers killed scores of </p><p>civilians in reprisal for the execution of 19 </p><p>soldiers. While in Washington, Batagarawa wants to </p><p>meet with human rights NGOs, particularly Human Rights </p><p>Watch, and hopes to make calls at State, DOD and on </p><p>the Hill. He might be joined by Dr. Sani Sufi, the </p><p>Secretary of the Judicial Inquiry on Conflict in </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Benue, Plateau, Nassarawa and Taraba States, to help </p><p>brief people on the latest in the investigations. </p><p>Batagarawa added that he hoped to resolve the issue of </p><p>funding for the Commission before his departure for </p><p>Washington.  Ambassador Jeter commended his plan to </p><p>call on human rights NGOs as well as keeping in touch </p><p>with the Hill. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Focusing on Benue, the Ambassador noted that he </p><p>had spoken to former Chief of Army Staff Malu </p><p>recently, who was going to make a submission to the </p><p>Commission. Malu was still upset that the President </p><p>had not apologized for the events of last October or </p><p>offered condolences to the families.  Batagarawa </p><p>argued that an apology could impugn guilt, an </p><p>inappropriate step before the Commission completed its </p><p>investigations.  The Commission had to be allowed to </p><p>function without influence or complications created by </p><p>public statements from the government; the </p><p>institutionalization of rule of law being the ultimate </p><p>goal.  Becoming animated, and showing disdain for Tiv </p><p>claims of being the sole victims, the Army Minister </p><p>added that Tiv were killing Fulani, "on a daily basis- </p><p>even today, as we sit here." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) COMMENT: Conflict between Fulani, Tiv and Jukun </p><p>is still an unfortunate common occurrence in the </p><p>troubled eastern Middle Belt, despite the efforts of </p><p>federal security services and some state governments. </p><p>Fulani nomadic herders are often targets of Tiv </p><p>farmers who perceive the Fulanis\' grazing cattle as a </p><p>threat to their crops.  The causes of clashes between </p><p>Tiv and Jukun are more complicated; involving access </p><p>to resources through control of local governments and </p><p>historical distrust over past grievances.  The </p><p>Commission, in addition to investigating unlawful </p><p>acts, is supposed to reveal the causes of these </p><p>conflicts, and to offer solutions (Ref C). END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>===== </p><p>RONCO </p><p>===== </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Shifting the conversation to Operation Avid </p><p>Recovery (OAR) and the RONCO follow-on effort, </p><p>Ambassador Jeter updated the Minister on the successes </p><p>of the OAR team, in terms of ordnance and civil </p><p>affairs work.  As RONCO would soon begin operations, </p><p>the contractor would likely need points-of-contact in </p><p>Abuja and Lagos to address operational and other </p><p>issues.  Ideally, one POC should be civilian, the </p><p>other military.  For example, RONCO needed C-4 or an </p><p>equivalent to destroy unexploded ordnance, but was </p><p>unsure to whom to turn for its supply or if C-4 were </p><p>even available in Nigeria.  Moreover, RONCO would need </p><p>assistance for duty-free customs clearance for its </p><p>equipment, as delays would seriously impede its work. </p><p>6. (C) Batagarawa agreed, and said his Special </p><p>Assistant, Balarabe Lawal would be the Abuja-GON POC </p><p>for the contractor.  Lawal would help resolve issues </p><p>and would keep Batagarawa in the loop.  The Minister </p><p>said he would check on the C-4 question himself. </p><p>Meanwhile, he would identify a POC from the military </p><p>in Lagos that he could trust to assist RONCO there. </p><p>Batagarawa was tempted to call the Customs Chief </p><p>himself to facilitate the RONCO shipments.  Thinking </p><p>better of it, he reasoned that the Ministry and </p><p>Services have people in Lagos who work with Customs </p><p>there.  In the long run, utilizing the people in Lagos </p><p>would be more reliable.  In any case, RONCO would have </p><p>the support it needed to get the job done, Batagarawa </p><p>promised. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) COMMENT: We have plans for the RONCO team </p><p>leader to come to Abuja meetings the week of May 20. </p><p>This will ensure a smooth operation on this end, and </p><p>facilitate Lawal\'s assistance to the contractor. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Batagarawa has not been able to provide an </p><p>answer on C-4 equivalent, though we have been in daily </p><p>contact with his office on the subject. It may not be </p><p>available in Nigeria.  He planned to name BG Emden, </p><p>Commandant at Ikeja, as the Lagos POC, but PolMilOff </p><p>suggested otherwise due to problems with Emden. </p><p>Batagarawa readily agreed to find someone else, and </p><p>has been discussing "the right person" with MG Abdu, </p><p>GOC of 1 Division.  In any case, with his assurances </p><p>we are mildly confident that we can move the RONCO </p><p>mission forward.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
