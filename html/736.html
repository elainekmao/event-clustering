CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SERBS LIVING AROUND PAKRAC, IN SECTOR WEST, ARE </p><p>INCREASINGLY CONCERNED OVER WHAT THE FUTURE HOLDS IN STORE </p><p>FOR THEM, ESPECIALLY AFTER HEARING STORIES AND SEEING </p><p>EVIDENCE OF MISTREATMENT OF FELLOW SERBS IN CROATIAN </p><p>DETENTION CENTERS.  DURING A MAY 16 VISIT TO THE AREA, </p><p>SERBS WHO HAD BEEN HELD IN THE VARAZDIN DETENTION CENTER </p><p>TOLD POLOFFS STORIES OF RANDOM BEATINGS AND HARASSMENT. </p><p>DETAINEES WERE REPORTEDLY FORCED TO SIT FOR HOURS IN </p><p>CRAMPED POSITIONS, SING CROATIAN PATRIOTIC SONGS, AND </p><p>ORDERED UP AND DOWN THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT MAKING IT </p><p>IMPOSSIBLE TO SLEEP.  PEOPLE AVOIDED USING THE TOILET </p><p>FACILITIES FOR FEAR OF BEING BEATEN. </p><p> </p><p>3.  ONE MAN TOLD OF HAVING TO KNEEL WITH HIS HANDS BEHIND </p><p>HIS HEAD AND BEING QUESTIONED ABOUT HIS FAMILY BACKGROUND. </p><p>WHEN, IN RESPONSE TO A QUESTION,  HE SAID HE HAD BEEN A </p><p>PARTISAN IN WWII, HE WAS PUNCHED IN THE RIBS.  ANOTHER MAN </p><p>WAS KICKED FOR FAILING TO EAT THE HALF LOAF OF BREAD HE </p><p>WAS GIVEN (HE HAD NO WATER WITH WHICH TO WASH IT DOWN). </p><p> </p><p>4.  BOTH MEN RAISED THEIR SHIRTS TO SHOW THEIR TORSOS, </p><p>ARMS AND LEGS STILL COVERED WITH LARGE BRUISES.  OTHER MEN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  01909  01 OF 02  171640Z </p><p>WE SPOKE WITH CLAIMED TO HAVE BEEN BEATEN, BUT TO A FAR </p><p>LESSER DEGREE.  SEVERAL OTHERS ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THEY HAD </p><p>NOT BEEN BEATEN AT ALL.  THE BEATINGS APPEARED TO HAVE </p><p>FOLLOWED NO PATTERN AND WERE SOLELY TO INTIMIDATE. </p><p> </p><p>5.  THERE WAS GENERAL AGREEMENT AMONG THOSE WITH WHOM WE </p><p>SPOKE THAT THE TREATMENT DETAINEES IN BJELOVAR HAD BEEN </p><p>"CORRECT."  HOWEVER, THEY TOLD US THAT THERE HAD BEEN </p><p>SEVERE BEATINGS AND MISTREATMENT OF PRISONERS ON ONE OF </p><p>THE TWO BUSES WHICH HAD BROUGHT PRISONERS BACK TO PAKRAC </p><p>FROM BJELOVAR EARLY THAT MORNING.  WE WERE UNABLE TO SPEAK </p><p>TO ANY OF THESE INDIVIDUALS TO OBTAIN DETAILS OR CONFIRM </p><p>THE STORY. </p><p> </p><p>6.  SERB LEADER VELJKO DZAKULA TOLD US HE BELIEVED THAT, </p><p>"IF IT WERE NOT FOR VARAZDIN," MANY OF THE SERBS REMAINING </p><p>IN "SECTOR WEST" WOULD BE INCLINED TO STAY IN CROATIA.  HE </p><p>HAD BEEN TRYING TO PERSUADE PEOPLE TO STAY BUT NOW WAS </p><p>BEGINNING TO THINK THAT "THE CROATS DO NOT WANT THE SERBS </p><p>TO REMAIN."  HE FELT THAT A GUARANTEE THAT A SIZEABLE UN </p><p>FORCE (PREFERABLY ONE INCLUDING AMERICANS) WOULD REMAIN IN </p><p>AREA WAS KEY. </p><p> </p><p>7.  EXCEPT FOR DZAKULA, NONE OF THE DOZEN OR SO SERBS WITH </p><p>WHOM WE SPOKE WAS INCLINED TO STAY BEHIND.  IN MANY CASES, </p><p>THEY HELD BACK ONLY BECAUSE THEY HAD RELATIVES WHO WERE </p><p>STILL MISSING AND WERE UNCERTAIN OF WHAT PROPERTY THEY </p><p>WOULD BE ALLOWED TO TAKE WITH THEM.  A FARMER FROM PAKRAC </p><p>WHO HAD LOST ALL OF HIS STOCK AND FARM BUILDINGS DURING </p><p>THE 1991 WAR SAID HE AND HIS FAMILY WOULD BE PREPARED TO </p><p>LEAVE CROATIA IMMEDIATELY IF HE THOUGHT HE COULD TAKE HIS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  01909  01 OF 02  171640Z </p><p>TRACTOR (WHICH HAD NEVER BEEN PROPERLY REGISTERED) WITH </p><p>HIM. </p><p> </p><p>8.  A YOUNG MAN, WHO HAD BEEN HELD IN VARAZDIN BUT NOT </p><p>BEATEN, DESCRIBED WHAT HE FELT WERE EXTREMELY BLEAK CAREER </p><p>PROSPECTS IN CROATIA FOR PEOPLE LIKE HIMSELF (HE HAD </p><p>RECEIVED TECHNICAL SCHOOL TRAINING IN ELECTROMECHANICS). </p><p>ONE OF THE MEN SEVERELY BEATEN IN VARAZDIN WAS STILL </p><p>WAITING FOR WORD OF HIS SON WHO HAD YET TO BE RELEASED. </p><p>PEOPLE HAD LIVED IN THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE SECTOR BEFORE </p><p>THE 1991 WAR SAW NO POINT IN RETURNING TO HOMES THAT WERE </p><p>NOW RUBBLE AND AN UNCERTAIN RECEPTION FROM THEIR FORMER </p><p>NEIGHBORS. </p><p> </p><p>9.  COMMENT:  WE ARE INCLINED TO THINK THAT THE BEATINGS </p><p>AND MISTREATMENT DESCRIBED ABOVE WERE CARRIED OUT </p><p>INDEPENDENTLY AND IN CONTRAVENTION OF THE WISHES AND </p><p>INSTRUCTIONS OF THE GOC.  NEVERTHELESS, THEY GIVE SERIOUS </p><p>CAUSE FOR CONCERN, ESPECIALLY FOR THE WELFARE OF DETAINEES </p><p>WHOSE WHEREABOUTS ARE UNKNOWN AND WHOM THE CROATS MAY </p><p>SUSPECT OF HAVING COMMITTED WAR CRIMES.  FROM OUR </p><p>CONVERSATIONS, IT IS CLEAR THAT THE GOC WILL HAVE TO DO </p><p>MORE THAN JUST PROMISE SECURITY AND EQUAL TREATMENT UNDER </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NNNNPTQ1852 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ1852 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  01909  02 OF 02  171641Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-01 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   AMAD-01  CIAE-00  SMEC-00  OASY-00  EB-01 </p><p>      FBIE-00  H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-08    L-01     ADS-00 </p><p>      M-00     NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   PA-01    PM-00    PRS-01 </p><p>      P-01     SCT-00   SP-00    SR-00    SS-00    STR-01   TRSE-00 </p><p>      T-00     USIE-00  SNIS-00  NISC-01  PMB-00   PRME-01  PRMC-01 </p><p>      DRL-09   G-00       /032W </p><p>                  ------------------C695D6  171641Z /38 </p><p>P 171736Z MAY 95 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 5813 </p><p>INFO HQ JTF PP NAPLES IT//CA/POLAD// </p><p>SECDEF WASHDC//ISA/ISP// </p><p>AMCONSUL MUNICH </p><p>USLO SKOPJE </p><p>AMEMBASSY BAKU </p><p>AMEMBASSY LJUBLJANA </p><p>USMISSION USVIENNA </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA </p><p>AMEMBASSY BELGRADE </p><p>NATO EU COLLECTIVE </p><p>NSC WASHDC </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 ZAGREB 001909 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>VIENNA ALSO FOR BOSNIA; USVIENNA ALSO FOR USDEL CSCE </p><p>BRUSSELS ALSO FOR USEU </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  01909  02 OF 02  171641Z </p><p>BAKU FOR DCM FINN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: 05/17/00 </p><p>TAGS:  PHUM, PREL, HR </p><p>SUBJECT:  HEIGHTENED FEARS OF "SECTOR WEST" SERBS AFTER </p><p>          BEATINGS IN DETENTION CENTERS </p><p> </p><p>THE LAW IF IT TRULY WISHES "SECTOR WEST" SERBS TO REMAIN </p><p>IN CROATIA.
