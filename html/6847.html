The loan </p><p>aims to keep Turkey out of Northern Iraq, and to encourage </p><p>increased cooperation with the U.S.  `The grant might be </p><p>jeopardized if Turkey enters Northern Iraq,\' an anonymous </p><p>U.S. official said.  "Vatan" reports about the ongoing </p><p>disagreement between the U.S. and Turkey over political and </p><p>military issues.  The U.S. says Turkish troops should be put </p><p>under the command of coalition forces, while Turkey prefers </p><p>independent action that would be coordinated with U.S. </p><p>troops.  "Zaman" carries the U.S. concern that Turkish </p><p>troops might be permanently settled in the region.  AKP </p><p>officials are busy drafting a new motion for cooperation </p><p>with the U.S., papers report.  According to the motion, the </p><p>U.S. will be advised to deploy troops in Northern Iraq </p><p>instead of Turkey, and to keep Kurdish groups under control. </p><p>On the other hand, Parliamentary Speaker Arinc blamed the </p><p>Turkish press on Tuesday for being a mouthpiece for the </p><p>Pentagon.  `Those who block democracy from prevailing in the </p><p>region can\'t complain of Saddam.  The U.S.-UK operation </p><p>against Iraq without a UN decision is not legitimate,\' Arinc </p><p>said.  The commander of U.S. special forces in Northern </p><p>Iraq, General Henry Osman, said on Tuesday that they would </p><p>exert efforts to coordinate humanitarian aid for refugees </p><p>and the protection of minorities in the region.  "Hurriyet" </p><p>claims Gen. Osman is planning to set up his HQ in the </p><p>Turkish border town of Silopi.  Papers report that the U.S </p><p>delivered six search and rescue helicopters and 82 </p><p>containers of military equipment to Iskenderun port on </p><p>Tuesday.  The MFA confirmed that the helicopters came for </p><p>humanitarian purposes.  Most papers asserted that U.S. </p><p>personnel are not leaving Turkey.  "Turkiye claims that </p><p>Washington has been abandoned by allied Kurdish groups.  PUK </p><p>leader Talabani, engaged in a conflict with Iranian groups </p><p>on the border, is trying to avoid fighting with Iraqi </p><p>forces.  Barzani is reluctant to fight with the Iraqis as </p><p>well, saying he does not have sufficient troops or weapons. </p><p>U.S. Presidential Envoy Khalilzad had to go to Northern Iraq </p><p>to convince Kurdish leaders to be more supportive.  The U.S.- </p><p>led military campaign might trigger civil war in Iraq, an </p><p>anonymous Turkish intelligence source told "Radikal."  Kurds </p><p>might confront Arabs in the north, and Shiites might attack </p><p>Sunnis in the south.  That is why Ankara is against U.S. </p><p>plans for controlling Kirkuk in cooperation with Talabani, </p><p>and sharing control of Mosul with Barzani.  Meanwhile, in a </p><p>televised press conference from Diyarbakir, TGS Chief </p><p>General Ozkok said Wednesday morning that a possible attack </p><p>on Turkish troops in Northern Iraq or a flow of refugees </p><p>have been Turkey\'s most serious security concerns.  If </p><p>Turkish forces present in the region cannot manage to cope </p><p>with such threats, Ankara might consider sending additional </p><p>troops there, Gen. Ozkok said.  `However, our strategic </p><p>ally, the United States, is currently engaged in a war in </p><p>the region, and we will coordinate our action with the U.S.\' </p><p>`We do not intend to set up a permanent buffer zone inside </p><p>Northern Iraq.  If developments reach a certain point, we </p><p>won\'t engage in armed conflict except if needed for self- </p><p>defense.  Despite all our transparency, some allied </p><p>countries\' skeptical view of Turkey has deeply affected the </p><p>Turkish people.  I can\'t understand those who see a threat </p><p>overseas but don\'t believe Turkey faces the same kind of </p><p>threat just across its border,\' the General said.  Ozkok </p><p>also said that `Iraq must be disarmed for the security of </p><p>Turkey and the region, but without ridding it of its </p><p>capability of self-defense.  However, this is neither our </p><p>war nor our task.  Our foreign policy requires that Iraq\'s </p><p>oil resources should be used by the entire Iraqi nation.\' </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION:  War in Iraq </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The US in Iraq: An invader or savior?" </p><p>Mehmet Barlas argued in mass appeal Sabah (3/26): "Currently </p><p>the people of Iraq, regardless of their being pro-Saddam or </p><p>not, consider the US army as an invader.  The psychology is </p><p>much different from that of the days of Desert Storm. </p><p>Iraqis were </p><p>well aware of their mistake in invading Kuwait. Therefore </p><p>the Desert Storm operation did not experience any resistance </p><p>on the Iraqi side. . However, the situation is not the same </p><p>at present.  The US seems to be fighting to capture Iraq </p><p>after toppling Saddam.  The  Iraqis are fighting against the </p><p>power that invades their motherland.  In the eyes of the </p><p>Iraqi people, being saved from Saddam cannot be an excuse </p><p>for being invaded by the US.   It is clear that once the war </p><p>is over and an American victory secured, the US identity in </p><p>Iraq will be as `occupying force,\' not `savior.\'" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The war and Turkish foreign policy" </p><p>Sami Kohen expects some Turkish foreign policy changes </p><p>during the post-war era in mass appeal Milliyet (3/26): </p><p>"Once the war is over, there will be an immediate impact on </p><p>Turkish foreign policy.  Given the fact that strategic </p><p>relations between Turkey and the US have been damaged, it </p><p>remains to be seen whether Turkish foreign policy will </p><p>incline  more toward the EU side or the Islamic world. . The </p><p>Turkish government, as can be seen in a statement by Foreign </p><p>Minister Gul, is stressing that the tiff with the US is </p><p>completely undesired and has not been created deliberately. </p><p>Turkey does not consider EU and the US as alternatives to </p><p>each other.  .The wise thing to do for the future of Turkish </p><p>foreign policy is to pursue efforts to enhance relations </p><p>with both the US and the EU.  The same argument goes for </p><p>other international policy centers as well.  Yet the overall </p><p>atmosphere in the Iraq war as well as its outcome will shape </p><p>the new trends in Turkish foreign policy." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
