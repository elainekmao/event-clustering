<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 003347 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/20/2007 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, EAIR, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: FOLLOW UP ON RJ FLIGHTS TO IRAQ: FONMIN TALKS TO </p><p>RJ PRESIDENT, MFA SAYS U.S. MESSAGE LOUD AND CLEAR </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 112154 </p><p>     B. AMMAN 3130 </p><p>     C. USUN 1531 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: PolCouns Doug Silliman for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  Following up on our June 11 demarche on the </p><p>frequency and regularity of Royal Jordanian (RJ) flights to </p><p>Iraq (ref b), PolCouns met June 20 with Ali al-Ayed, Personal </p><p>Assistant to FonMin Muasher, and Samer Naber, MFA Legal </p><p>Advisor.  Ayed said that, since the June 11 demarche, the </p><p>Jordanian Embassy in Baghdad had issued a circular diplomatic </p><p>note retracting its earlier note (which had advertised RJ </p><p>flights to Amman and offered diplomatic discounts).  He said </p><p>the issue of RJ flights to Iraq was being discussed "at a </p><p>very high level," noting that FonMin Muasher had spoken to RJ </p><p>President Samer Majali about it earlier this week.  Ayed said </p><p>the GOJ had heard the U.S. message "loud and clear" and had </p><p>no intention of violating the UN sanctions regime on Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  PolCouns reminded Ayed and Naber that it was not </p><p>only the advertising of the flights, but their regularity and </p><p>frequency, that had raised concerns in Washington.  He hoped </p><p>that the GOJ would take these USG concerns into consideration </p><p>in their internal deliberations. </p><p> </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
