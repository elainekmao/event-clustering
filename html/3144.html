<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 001805 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>RIYADH FOR POL - R. HANKS </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O.12958: DECL: 06/10/12 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, MOPS, XY, LI, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: DIVERGENT GON VIEWS ON LIBERIA </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 102686 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY CHARGE ANDREWS. REASON 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: Recent discussions with two senior GON </p><p>officials reveal GON ambivalence on Liberia. </p><p>Vacillating between two divergent philosophical </p><p>approaches, Nigeria\'s position on Liberia is fluid and </p><p>not fixed to any coherent strategy. One contending </p><p>belief, championed by Special Advisor on Conflict </p><p>Resolution Uwechue and based on a vague pan-African </p><p>romanticism, is that the Liberian conflict can be </p><p>extinguished and Charles Taylor can be converted </p><p>through discussion and neutral mediation. The other </p><p>perspective, advanced by Presidential Special Advisor </p><p>Ad\'obe Obe, is tougher and edgier. This approach also </p><p>starts with discussions but here Nigeria assumes the </p><p>role of interested power not selfless mediator. If a </p><p>party refuses Abuja\'s counsel, Nigeria sees a </p><p>rejection of its sub-regional primacy and will draw </p><p>distance between itself and that party. Because </p><p>President Taylor recently rebuffed Obasanjo\'s offer to </p><p>visit Abuja, the Obe viewpoint is currently ascendant. </p><p>Because of Taylor\'s contumacy, Nigeria is willing, for </p><p>the time being, to let the Liberian President continue </p><p>to feel the press of the LURD at his back. End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>HAVE CONFLICT, WILL TALK </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) During a conversation in late May with </p><p>PolCouns, Special Presidential Advisor for Conflict </p><p>Resolution, Ambassador Ralph Uwechue, extolled </p><p>continued dialogue and mediation to resolve the </p><p>Liberian crisis. Uwechue contended progress would not </p><p>have visited Sierra Leone but for the GON policy of </p><p>dialogue with Taylor. Everyone knew the path to peace </p><p>in Sierra Leone went through Monrovia because of </p><p>Taylor\'s mentoring of the RUF.  Nigeria could have </p><p>ostracized Taylor and sought a military solution </p><p>against the RUF. This, Uwechue expostulated, would </p><p>have led to prolonged but inclusive fighting -- a </p><p>perennial military stalemate. Uwechue mentioned that </p><p>constant entreaties and overtures by Obasanjo asking </p><p>Taylor to urge the RUF to cooperate in the peace </p><p>process transformed the Liberian leader from chaperone </p><p>of RUF mayhem to encouraging the group to down their </p><p>weapons and take to the electoral hustings. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Although noting the contributions of Britain\'s </p><p>muscular presence in Sierra Leone, UNAMSIL and the UN </p><p>sanctions to the peace process, Uwechue remained loyal </p><p>to his credo that dialogue was the most critical </p><p>factor in the peace process. Now, he saw the need to </p><p>employ the same tool to work with Taylor in his own </p><p>front yard. Acknowledging the task in Liberia would be </p><p>more difficult because the stakes for Taylor were </p><p>higher, Uwechue advocated that Nigeria continue to </p><p>talk to Taylor. Nigeria recognized the importance of </p><p>dialogue in resolving African conflicts, including </p><p>Liberia, he declared. Breaking the line of </p><p>communication was anathema. Although this method </p><p>seemed circuitous and time-consuming, it simply was </p><p>not enough to develop a plan for peace; to be succeed, </p><p>one must develop a plan for how to make Taylor believe </p><p>that he has developed the plan for peace. The more </p><p>Taylor feels that other countries are not interested </p><p>in toppling him and think he is capable of good, the </p><p>more reasonable he will be. While Taylor\'s book of </p><p>misdeeds is voluminous, he is neither a devil nor are </p><p>many of the rest of us saints, Uwechue posited. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Uwechue urged the USG to exploit Taylor\'s </p><p>current predicament diplomatically. LURD success has </p><p>rendered him off-balance; in his weakened political </p><p>state, Taylor will be more amenable to compromise, </p><p>Uwechue offered.  However, if the international </p><p>community remains relatively mute in the face of an </p><p>apparently tumescent LURD, he will suspect </p><p>international support for the insurgents. Taylor\'s </p><p>paranoia would increase, bringing more fighting and </p><p>suppression of domestic dissent in its wake. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Uwechue thought we should implement a policy </p><p>of what could be termed "positive containment." Under </p><p>this strategem, we would inform Taylor that his ouster </p><p>is not our objective but he must cease encroachments </p><p>into neighboring real estate. If extra-territorial </p><p>ambitions continued to rule him, we would actively </p><p>oppose these designs; as long as he desisted from </p><p>cross-border misconduct, Taylor could expect our </p><p>indifference, at the very least, even in the face of </p><p>some degree of continued misrule at home. Moreover, </p><p>willingness for political and economic openness at </p><p>home could turn that benign indifference -- matching </p><p>each constructive, reform-oriented step on his part by </p><p>one on ours -- into a more positive engagement. Part </p><p>of that positive engagement would include pressing </p><p>Guinea to be a much less gracious host to the LURD. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) In the final analysis, Uwechue claimed, </p><p>Liberia was not amenable to a military solution. The </p><p>prospect of chronic stalemate between the LURD and the </p><p>GOL was depressing.  The political pedigree of the </p><p>LURD leadership was equally frightening; that group </p><p>promised to govern no better than Taylor, if they </p><p>managed to oust him. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>PAX NIGERIANA, TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Both in tenor and substance, Presidential </p><p>Advisor Obe\'s view of Liberia differed significantly </p><p>from Uwechue\'s. Obe recalled President Obasanjo trying </p><p>to consult with and counsel Taylor; yet Monrovia </p><p>remained deaf to Abuja\'s voice. Now, President </p><p>Obasanjo has little patience or sympathy for Taylor, </p><p>Obe contended. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Obe saw almost no possibility for peaceful </p><p>resolution in Liberia due to Taylor\'s intransigent </p><p>meanness.  Embedded in Taylor\'s pathology is an innate </p><p>inability to follow reason when it does not </p><p>immediately sate of his appetite for power. When </p><p>confronted between what is rational and what he </p><p>desires, Taylor will choose the latter. Talk alone </p><p>cannot sway him. The offer of some political carrots </p><p>is unlikely to hold influence because Taylor wants to </p><p>own the entire farm. The only thing that attracts </p><p>Taylor\'s undivided attention is a demonstration of </p><p>force, Obe maintained. Obe doubted that Obasanjo would </p><p>attempt to reach out to Taylor any time soon. If he </p><p>does not want Nigeria\'s involvement in resolving this </p><p>crisis, he will not get it. Taylor has made this mess </p><p>for himself, now let him flail in it, Obe scoffed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) In a certain sense, the views on Liberia </p><p>expressed by Uwechue and Obe reveal as much about </p><p>their personalities as their input into GON policy. </p><p>Uwechue is by nature ebullient and an optimist. There </p><p>are few people he dislikes; he would talk to a boulder </p><p>if told there was a slight chance it might budge. The </p><p>acerbic Obe has a much more cynical worldview, and not </p><p>everyone is his friend.  Indeed, others at State House </p><p>sometimes call him the "Most Obnoxious Nigerian" </p><p>(given the number of other formidable contestants, </p><p>this is a truly stinging characterization with which </p><p>we do not really agree). Because of his avowed pan- </p><p>Africanism, Uwechue\'s stance on regional conflict </p><p>resolution has a precatory quality. Promotion of the </p><p>pan-Africanist ideal requires Nigeria to remain </p><p>involved in conflict resolution and continue to reach </p><p>out even when rebuffed. Not so with Obe. Unlike </p><p>Uwechue, he is not a staunch pan-Africanist, and there </p><p>is little space for romanticism in his creed. He does </p><p>not easily countenance insolence from Nigeria\'s lesser </p><p>neighbors. If another country crosses Nigeria, he is </p><p>prone write off that country. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Both men profess to know and reflect </p><p>Obasanjo\'s GON views on Liberia, and, paradoxically, </p><p>we believe both are correct. Obasanjo operates as his </p><p>own foreign minister, particularly on Liberia. </p><p>Obasanjo\'s personality -- and his approach to Liberia </p><p>-- have elements of Uwechue\'s congeniality and Obe\'s </p><p>jagged edges. Angered by Taylor\'s stubbornness and </p><p>rejection of the invitation to visit Abuja (the second </p><p>rejection this year), Obasanjo currently is probably </p><p>closer to Obe\'s position. However, that might not last </p><p>long. Events in Liberia, further discussions with </p><p>other regional leaders, or something extraneous could </p><p>cause Obasanjo\'s mood to swing back toward engagement. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) Affecting all of this are the time constraints </p><p>imposed by the President\'s demanding schedule. </p><p>Obasanjo is has a busy travel itinerary for the </p><p>remainder of June and much of July. This could limit </p><p>the attention he gives Liberia during the next several </p><p>weeks. Moreover, as Nigeria\'s electoral season </p><p>steadily moves toward full swing, the desire and </p><p>opportunities to be fully engaged on Liberia will </p><p>diminish for Obasanjo, particularly with the need to </p><p>shore-up his re-nomination bid before the PDP national </p><p>convention slated for October. </p><p>ANDREWS </p><p></p></div>
