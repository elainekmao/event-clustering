<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 001705 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT PLEASE PASS USTR </p><p>USDOC FOR ITA/MAC/DDEFALCO </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, TU, USTR, WTO </p><p>SUBJECT:  GOT Response on WTO Services Negotiations </p><p>Demarche </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Ref: State 50753 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Oya Karakas, Head of Department in the MFA General </p><p>Directorate of Multilateral Economic Affairs, sent </p><p>Embassy the following reply on March 11 to reftel </p><p>demarche on the WTO services negotiations.  The reply </p><p>indicates that the GOT may not meet the March 31 </p><p>deadline for submission of initial services offers. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Begin Text MFA Reply: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.03.2003 </p><p>EGY-I </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SOME PRELIMINARY VIEWS ON THE WTO GATS NEGOTIATIONS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Trade in services has always been an area priority for </p><p>Turkey, in the context of multilateral trade </p><p>negotiations throughout the Uruguay Round. We have not </p><p>only actively participated in the work of the WTO </p><p>Council for Trade in Services and its subsidiary bodies, </p><p>but we have also taken our part in the negotiations </p><p>mandated by the GATS. The extent of our Uruguay Round </p><p>commitments and the level of liberalisation in our </p><p>services sector clearly show our intentions. Moreover, </p><p>since the beginning of these mandated negotiations, we </p><p>have supported the process with our flexible approach </p><p>and made our contribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In this spirit, we have received initial requests from </p><p>some of our trade partners and presented ours to some of </p><p>them. We have also carried out some bilateral contacts </p><p>with them, including the US. We are pleased with the </p><p>level of interaction and cooperation among the </p><p>negotiation teams of members in services negotiations </p><p>and we happily observe a certain degree of progress. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>We are well aware of timeframes of the Doha Development </p><p>Agenda, but as we all know, these indicative timeframes </p><p>are foreseen for all areas of negotiation and services </p><p>negotiations cannot be excluded from the whole picture. </p><p>We should not forget the fact that these timeframes of </p><p>the DDA concerning different areas are all interrelated. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>At this stage of the negotiations, while some deadlines </p><p>are approaching and some are already met, unfortunately </p><p>we are still far from substantial achievements in some </p><p>areas. We also see a certain reluctance shown by some </p><p>members. For instance, there is not yet enough progress </p><p>in the TRIPS Agreement negotiations such as protection </p><p>for geographical indications and access to medicines. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>As for the 31 March 2003 deadline for initial offers in </p><p>services, we are not yet certain about whether we will </p><p>be able to meet this deadline or not. Although we are in </p><p>process of assessing our interests and the priorities of </p><p>our sectors, as well as the initial requests that we </p><p>have received so far, we are not yet in a position to </p><p>set an exact date for conclusion of our initial study. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In addition to general concerns about liberalization and </p><p>greater market access for foreigners, we also have </p><p>certain sensitivities concerning our existing bilateral </p><p>commitments with our certain trading partners, such as </p><p>the EU. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Needless to say, conclusion of the required "modalities" </p><p>is not only important, but it is a prerequisite for the </p><p>negotiations. Since the beginning, we have been as </p><p>flexible as possible, so that the discussions for </p><p>modalities should not be an obstacle for negotiations. </p><p>Similarly, we have also been flexible in the issue of </p><p>assessment of trade. In order not to delay the </p><p>negotiations, we accepted that it is an ongoing process. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>We fully understand the importance of "autonomous </p><p>liberalization" for certain members and we are following </p><p>the discussions on this issue and we are quite flexible </p><p>on it. Since, we expect the outcome to be a voluntary </p><p>mechanism, we see this issue as a secondary one. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>We understand the importance of liberalization in </p><p>certain sectors, for your service suppliers. In fact, </p><p>all members have their own priorities and hopefully </p><p>throughout the negotiations we will accommodate all </p><p>these in a manner beneficial and acceptable for all. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Among some sectors, commitments and market access for </p><p>natural persons, or "Mode 4" commitments are </p><p>particularly important for us. This comes as a result of </p><p>the demands of our dynamic population. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>At this stage, our initial consultations with our </p><p>relevant authorities and related sectors are still under </p><p>way and we are preparing our initial offers. We </p><p>understand that we may later revise them according to </p><p>the offers and requests of other members. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In this connection, we are looking forward to initial </p><p>offers of developed members. In our view, these offers </p><p>will be an important indicator for the direction of the </p><p>negotiations. The response of the developed members for </p><p>the requests of the developing members may have positive </p><p>or negative ramifications in other negotiation fora at </p><p>the WTO. </p><p>End Text. </p><p>Pearson </p><p></p></div>
