The DART Field Team West visited Ar Rutbah, Anbar Governorate </p><p>on 10 May, meeting with cooperative agreement partner World </p><p>Vision, the former hospital director, and Coalition forces. </p><p>Since the DART\'s last visit to Ar Rutbah on 6 May, the town of </p><p>25,000 people experienced a failed distribution of donated food </p><p>and clothes, witnessed an airdrop of 100,000 UXO awareness </p><p>leaflets, conducted a city council meeting, and underwent the </p><p>cleanup of four UXO areas, including the </p><p>new temporary hospital.  Ar Rutbah also received visits from the </p><p>Greek Orthodox Church, the Jordanian Ministry of Health, Convoy </p><p>of Hope, ICRC and the Emirates Red Crescent Society.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>WORLD VISION INTERNATIONAL </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  DART partner World Vision International (WVI) returned to Ar </p><p>Rutbah on 10 May to develop a seven-member committee to oversee </p><p>the DART-funded rehabilitation of a temporary hospital across </p><p>from the former hospital that was bombed.  The temporary </p><p>hospital, to be housed in the former Baath Party building, was </p><p>cleared of 457 pieces of unexploded ordnance (UXOs) by Coalition </p><p>forces.  The hospital committee will solicit contractor bids to </p><p>carry out water, sanitation, and other rehabilitation work to </p><p>prepare for the opening of the temporary hospital. </p><p> </p><p>3.  WVI planned to convene principals of all 12 Ar Rutbah schools </p><p>on 11 May to discuss DART-funded repairs to their water and </p><p>sanitation systems.  With the DART funds secured, WVI was able to </p><p>obtain private funds to purchase desks, chairs, and other school </p><p>property looted after the war. </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>OTHER DONORS </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>4.  The Greek Orthodox Church donated 11 tons of food and clothes </p><p>to Ar Rutbah on 7 May that the town\'s "governor" (Kah-em-makam) </p><p>said the 63 public distribution system agents would disburse to </p><p>residents.  The Coalition forces said the governor was soon </p><p>besieged by town residents because they thought a handful of </p><p>agents were profiting from the donation.  The governor\'s office </p><p>was damaged and the governor sought protection from the Coalition </p><p>forces outside of Ar Rutbah.  Coalition forces estimated one- </p><p>third of the donated boxes were missing.  The governor later said </p><p>he did not want additional food donations to Ar Rutbah because it </p><p>caused too many problems. </p><p> </p><p>5.  The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) visited </p><p>Ar Rutbah on 10 May and indicated it would rehabilitate the </p><p>clogged septic system at the health center and undertake a UXO </p><p>awareness program.  WVI said it would work closely with ICRC on </p><p>the program.  Throughout the week, the Jordan Ministry of Health </p><p>vaccinated all children from the ages six to fourteen.  On 6 May, </p><p>the non-governmental organization Convoy of Hope delivered </p><p>hospital equipment. Regarding water, CARE will soon begin its </p><p>DART-funded emergency water project, improving the faulty deep- </p><p>well, water system 20 kilometers south of Ar Rutbah. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>AR RUTBAH TOWN COUNCIL </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  The town\'s city council met on 10 May to discuss several </p><p>issues, including: </p><p> </p><p>--  Donation distribution: the Greek donation would be held until </p><p>enough food was donated for all residents; </p><p> </p><p>--  Fuel: Gas from the nearby H3 airfield would be tapped for the </p><p>town\'s gas station; </p><p> </p><p>--  Drug pricing: the health clinic is permitted to charge for </p><p>MOH drugs, but not donated drugs; </p><p> </p><p>--  UXOs and security; </p><p> </p><p>--  Water: Parts of town were not receiving water, while all </p><p>water lacked chlorine; and </p><p> </p><p>--  Municipal wages: most employees received a percentage of full </p><p>salaries this week from existing funds.  The council is comprised </p><p>of 25 representatives, of whom ten are sheiks.  The </p><p>others are directors of the town\'s schools, hospital, bank, </p><p>public buildings, and water.  Also on the council are the </p><p>governor, three mullahs, and one imam. </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
