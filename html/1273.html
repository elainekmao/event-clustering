TOM MCDONALD.  REASONS: 1.5 (B) AND </p><p>(D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY: SINCE ITS JULY 20 OPENING (REFTEL), </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S NEW PARLIAMENT HAS FALLEN INTO RAUCOUS DEBATE </p><p>AND POLITICAL SPARRING THAT HAS YIELDED FEW CONCRETE </p><p>RESULTS.  ONE HUNDRED EIGHT OUT OF 150 MEMBERS ARE NEW </p><p>TO THE LEGISLATIVE BODY AND THIS HAS BEEN REFLECTED IN </p><p>THE LOW QUALITY OF DEBATE.   MAIDEN SPEECHES AND </p><p>PAROCHIAL CONCERNS HAVE CONSUMED MUCH OF THE BODY\'S TIME </p><p>SINCE IT OPENED (IT HAS BEEN IN SESSION ONLY FOUR OF THE </p><p>LAST SEVEN WEEKS) DESPITE A GENERAL RECOGNITION THAT </p><p>URGENT ACTION IS NEEDED ON THE COUNTRY\'S DIRE ECONOMIC </p><p>CONDITION.  MANY MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC) </p><p>MEMBERS HAVE LAMBASTED THE GOVERNMENT, AND IN SOME </p><p>CASES, PRESIDENT MUGABE PERSONALLY, FOR FAILING TO </p><p>ADDRESS ZIMBABWE\'S MOUNTING WOES AND FOR ORCHESTRATING A </p><p>CAMPAIGN OF TERROR AGAINST ITS CITIZENS.  BEHIND THE </p><p>SCENES, A MORE SOPHISTICATED COMMITTEE SYSTEM IS TAKING </p><p>SHAPE, AND THERE ARE SIGNS THAT MEMBERS WILL COOPERATE </p><p>ACROSS THE AISLE ON SOME ISSUES.  HOWEVER, THE </p><p>WESTMINSTER-STYLE WHIP SYSTEM WILL LIKELY KEEP PARTY </p><p>MEMBERS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE IN LINE ON THE ISSUES </p><p>THAT COUNT MOST.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>PARLIAMENT, BULLY PULPIT AND THEATRE </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) AFTER A TWO-WEEK BREAK, PARLIAMENT RESUMED ITS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  05003  01 OF 03  110846Z </p><p>SESSION ON AUGUST 29.  THE DEBATE SINCE HAS BEEN </p><p>CHARACTERIZED BY A LEVEL OF POLITICAL ATTACKS AND </p><p>BACKBENCH SNIPING THAT WOULD PUT LONDON\'S PARLIAMENT TO </p><p>SHAME.  EVERY NEW PARLIAMENTARIAN IS BEING GIVEN A </p><p>CHANCE TO MAKE A MAIDEN SPEECH, AND THESE HAVE CONSUMED </p><p>MUCH OF THE PARLIAMENT\'S TIME.  MOST MDC MEMBERS HAVE </p><p>USED THESE OPPORTUNITIES TO ATTACK THE GOVERNMENT FOR </p><p>ITS FAILURE TO TURN AROUND THE COUNTRY\'S SLIDING ECONOMY </p><p>WHILE POINTING OUT THE DECLINE IN HEALTH SERVICES OR </p><p>LACK OF ROAD MAINTENANCE IN THEIR HOME DISTRICTS.  SOME </p><p>MDC MEMBERS HAVE ATTACKED MUGABE PERSONALLY FOR THE </p><p>VIOLENCE LEADING UP TO THE JUNE PARLIAMENTARY VOTE, AND </p><p>THESE SPEECHES HAVE RECEIVED PROMINENT COVERAGE IN THE </p><p>INDEPENDENT "DAILY NEWS."  EVELYN MASAITI OF NYANGA </p><p>DESCRIBED MUGABE ON AUGUST 31 AS A FATHER WHO HAS </p><p>BETRAYED HIS CHILDREN AND WHO IS NO LONGER WORTHY OF </p><p>BEING A FATHER.  (NOTE: EVELYN MASAITI IS ONE OF THE </p><p>PLAINTIFFS IN THE CIVIL SUIT FILED AGAINST THE PRESIDENT </p><p>IN NEW YORK.  MORE DETAILED INFORMATION ON THE </p><p>PLAINTIFFS WILL FOLLOW SEPTEL.  END NOTE.)  OUTSPOKEN MP </p><p>FOR GLEN NORAH, PRISCILLA MISIHAIRABWI-MUSHONGA, RAILED </p><p>AGAINST MUGABE ON SEPTEMBER 6, SAYING HIS OPENING SPEECH </p><p>TO PARLIAMENT (REFTEL) WAS IRRELEVANT TO THE COUNTRY AND </p><p>THAT HE IS THE SOURCE OF THE COUNTRY\'S PROBLEMS AND MUST </p><p>RESIGN.  SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE EMMERSON MNANGAGWA </p><p>CAUTIONED THE MP AGAINST BEING DISRESPECTFUL OF THE HEAD </p><p>OF STATE, WHICH CAUSED AN UPROAR FROM THE MDC BENCH. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) THE THEATRICS GOT INTO HIGH GEAR ON AUGUST 31 </p><p>WHEN MISIHAIRABWI THREATENED TO BEAT UP FELLOW MP - AND </p><p>WAR VETERANS LEADER - CHENJERAI HUNZVI FOR INTERRUPTING </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  05003  01 OF 03  110846Z </p><p>HER SEVERAL TIMES DURING HER SPEECH ABOUT THE DECLINING </p><p>ACCESS TO MEDICINE.  DURING THE SEPTEMBER 6 SESSION </p><p>ATTENDED BY POLOFF, MDC MEMBERS RETURNED THE FAVOR BY </p><p>HECKLING AND JEERING HUNZVI\'S MAIDEN SPEECH AND BROKE </p><p>INTO LAUGHTER WHEN HUNZVI SUGGESTED FOREIGN DONORS </p><p>SHOULD PROVIDE TRACTORS TO HIS CONSTITUENTS.  HALFWAY </p><p>THROUGH HUNZVI\'S RAMBLING DISCOURSE ABOUT THE HISTORY OF </p><p>LAND DEPRIVATION BY ZIMBABWE\'S COLONIZERS, NEARLY ALL OF </p><p>THE MDC MEMBERS WALKED OUT. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) SPEAKER MNANGAGWA SO FAR APPEARS FAIRLY EVEN- </p><p>HANDED IN HIS RUNNING OF THE PROCEEDINGS, CHOOSING HIS </p><p>INTERJECTIONS SPARINGLY AND JUDICIOUSLY.  ALTHOUGH HE </p><p>INTERVENES WHEN THE PRESIDENT\'S NAME IS DISPARAGED, HE </p><p>ALSO QUIETS THE RAUCOUS ZANU-PF BENCH WHEN IT DISRUPTS </p><p>AN MDC MOTION.  ON THE OTHER HAND, DEPUTY SPEAKER EDNA </p><p>MADZONGWE, WHO ACTS AS SPEAKER IN MNANGAGWA\'S ABSENCE, </p><p>HAS BEEN ACCUSED BY MDC MEMBERS OF STIFLING DEBATE. </p><p>DURING THE QUESTION TIME ON AUGUST 30, THE ENTIRE MDC </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY DELEGATION THREATENED TO WALK OUT WHEN </p><p>MADZONGWE REPEATEDLY REFUSED TO ALLOW QUESTIONS OF A </p><p>DEPUTY MINISTER ON THE FAST-TRACK LAND RESETTLEMENT </p><p>PROGRAM.  LIKE IN THE BRITISH PARLIAMENT, OPPOSITION </p><p>MEMBERS PERIODICALLY HAVE THE CHANCE TO QUESTION </p><p>GOVERNMENT MINISTERS ABOUT THEIR POLICIES AND ACTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ3329 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  05003  02 OF 03  110846Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00  CTME-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00   EXIM-01 </p><p>      E-00     FAAE-00  VC-00    FRB-00   H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00 </p><p>      IO-00    ITC-01   LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00 </p><p>      OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00 </p><p>      P-00     SP-00    SSO-00   STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00 </p><p>      DSCC-00  DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00    /012W </p><p>                  ------------------83A2F3  110846Z /38 </p><p>P 110843Z SEP 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 7045 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 HARARE 005003 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p>LONDON FOR CHARLES GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>USUN FOR HOLBROOKE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/11/10 </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, PREL, ECON, ZI, CG </p><p>SUBJECT:  NEW ZIMBABWE PARLIAMENT STILL FEELING ITS WAY </p><p> </p><p>UNTIL THE SITTING OF THIS PARLIAMENT, QUESTION TIME HAD </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  05003  02 OF 03  110846Z </p><p>BEEN A NON-EVENT THAT MINISTERS SELDOM WORRIED ABOUT. </p><p>NOW THEY ARE BEING SUBJECTED TO CLOSE AND PUBLIC </p><p>SCRUTINY. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY CRASH COURSE FOR MDC </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) ON SEPTEMBER 1 MDC MP FOR HARARE EAST TENDAI </p><p>BITI INFORMED POLOFF THAT THE MDC\'S MAIN GOAL IN </p><p>PARLIAMENT IS TO CREATE MORE POLITICAL SPACE FOR THE </p><p>OPPOSITION.  IN ORDER TO DO THIS, IT WILL FOCUS ON </p><p>PRESSING FOR A NEW CONSTITUTION, EXPOSING GOVERNMENT </p><p>MISMANAGEMENT, AND GAINING MORE CONTROL OVER THE BUDGET. </p><p>THE MDC WILL NOT PUSH FOR THE IMPEACHMENT OF MUGABE, </p><p>ACCORDING TO BITI, AS THE TIME WAS NOT YET RIPE.  NOR </p><p>DOES IT REALISTICALLY EXPECT TO GET FAR WITH ITS </p><p>REFORMIST AGENDA WHILE ZANU-PF HAS A PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>MAJORITY.  BITI ACKNOWLEDGED THAT MDC MPS ARE AT A </p><p>DISADVANTAGE IN HOUSE DELIBERATIONS SINCE NOT ALL OF </p><p>THEM HAVE MASTERED PARLIAMENTARY PROCEDURES, SUCH AS </p><p>TABLING MOTIONS.  MANY MDC MPS ARE STILL GRAPPLING WITH </p><p>FINDING OFFICE SPACE AND SETTING UP TELEPHONES, AND ARE </p><p>RELYING ON PERSONAL FUNDS UNTIL GOVERNMENT MONEY IS </p><p>DISBURSED TO COVER THESE EXPENSES. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) MOST MDC MPS ATTENDED TWO WORKSHOPS SPONSORED BY </p><p>THE INTERNATIONAL REPUBLICAN INSTITUTUE (IRI) IN JULY </p><p>AND AUGUST TO HELP GET THEM UP TO SPEED ON PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>PROCEDURE.  A SIMILAR PARLIAMENTARY TRAINING WORKSHOP IS </p><p>BEING SPONSORED SEPTEMBER 24-25 BY THE ZIMBABWE CHAMBER </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  05003  02 OF 03  110846Z </p><p>OF COMMERCE AND THE CONFEDERATION OF ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>INDUSTRIES (CZI), AND WILL INCLUDE MPS FROM BOTH ZANU-PF </p><p>AND THE MDC.  ACCORDING TO THE IRI RESPRESENTATIVE HERE, </p><p>AGENTS FROM THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATION (CIO) </p><p>SHOWED UP AT THE JULY WORKSHOP FOR MDC MEMBERS, ASKING </p><p>QUESTIONS ABOUT WHO WAS SPONSORING THE EVENT AND WHO WAS </p><p>ATTENDING IT.  THE ENCOUNTER DEMONSTRATED THE SENIOR </p><p>GOVERNMENT LEADERSHIP\'S ONGOING MISTRUST OF THE MDC. </p><p>DESPITE THE GOZ\'S MISTRUST, BITI STATED THAT MDC MEMBERS </p><p>ARE WORKING BEHIND THE SCENES WITH NEWLY ELECTED, MOSTLY </p><p>YOUNGER ZANU-PF MPS, WHO SEEM RECEPTIVE TO REACHING AN </p><p>UNDERSTANDING ON A VARIETY OF SECONDARY ISSUES. </p><p>HOWEVER, BITI DOES NOT EXPECT ANY OF THE ZANU-PF MPS TO </p><p>BREAK RANKS WITH THE PARTY ON THE CRUCIAL ISSUES OF THE </p><p>DAY SUCH AS LAND REFORM. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>REMAKING THE COMMITTEE SYSTEM </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) SINCE THE MDC NOW CONTROLS MORE THAN A THIRD OF </p><p>PARLIAMENT, MUCH IS BEING DONE TO REVAMP THE BODY\'S </p><p>COMMITTEE SYSTEM, ACCORDING TO AUSTIN ZVOMA, THE CLERK </p><p>OF PARLIAMENT AND HIGHEST RANKING CIVIL SERVANT IN </p><p>PARLIAMENT.  TWO OF THE BIGGEST CHANGES HAVE BEEN THE </p><p>REFORMULATION OF PORTFOLIO COMMITTEES TO REFLECT THE NEW </p><p>CABINET MINISTRIES AND THE INTRODUCTION OF "SHADOW" </p><p>MINISTERS, WHO REPRESENT THE OPPOSITION IN PARLIAMENT ON </p><p>ISSUES DEALT WITH BY THE GOVERNMENT MINISTRIES.  THE </p><p>STANDING RULES AND ORDER COMMITTEE, COMPRISED OF BOTH </p><p>ZANU-PF AND MDC MEMBERS, HAS ALREADY MET AND DETERMINED </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  05003  02 OF 03  110846Z </p><p>THAT THE CHAIRMANSHIPS OF THE 12 PORTFOLIO COMMITTEES </p><p>WILL BE DIVIDED EVENLY BETWEEN ZANU-PF AND MDC.  THE IRI </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE INFORMED US THAT THE MDC IS LIKELY TO </p><p>CHAIR THE EDUCATION, FOREIGN AFFAIRS, JUSTICE, </p><p>ENVIRONMENT, AND HEALTH COMMITTEES.  BESIDES THE </p><p>STANDING RULES AND ORDER COMMITTEE, THERE ARE NORMALLY </p><p>FIVE OTHER STANDING COMMITTEES THAT INCLUDE THE PUBLIC </p><p>ACCOUNTS COMMITTEE, WHICH OVERSEES GOVERNMENT SPENDING </p><p>LEGISLATED BY PARLIAMENT, AND THE ALL-IMPORTANT BUDGET </p><p>AND FINANCE COMMITTEE, WHICH APPROVES THE GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>BUDGET.  ZANU-PF WILL PROBABLY KEEP THE CHAIRMANSHIP OF </p><p>THE MORE INFLUENTIAL STANDING COMMITTEES, SUCH AS BUDGET </p><p>AND FINANCE.  PARLIAMENT IS DUE TO APPOINT THE </p><p>COMMITTEES AND THEIR CHAIRMEN ON SEPTEMBER 12. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) THE BUDGET AND FINANCE COMMITTEE IS DUE TO BEGIN </p><p>CONSIDERING THE GOVERNMENT\'S BUDGET IN LATE OCTOBER.  IT </p><p>WILL SCRUTINIZE THE BUDGET BEHIND CLOSED DOORS, ZVOMA </p><p>SAYS, BEFORE SUBMITTING IT TO THE WHOLE HOUSE FOR </p><p>DEBATE.  THE DEADLINE FOR PASSAGE OF THE BUDGET IS </p><p>JANUARY 1, THE BEGINNING OF THE NEW FISCAL YEAR.  THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT CANNOT LEGALLY LEVY TAXES WITHOUT BUDGETARY </p><p>APPROVAL FROM PARLIAMENT, THE CLERK STATED.  (COMMENT: </p><p>GIVEN THE NEW MAKEUP OF THIS PARLIAMENT, BUDGETARY </p><p>DEBATES ARE BOUND TO BE HEATED AND HIGHLY CONTENTIOUS. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ3330 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  05003  03 OF 03  110846Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00  CTME-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00   EXIM-01 </p><p>      E-00     FAAE-00  VC-00    FRB-00   H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00 </p><p>      IO-00    ITC-01   LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00 </p><p>      OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00 </p><p>      P-00     SP-00    SSO-00   STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00 </p><p>      DSCC-00  DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00    /012W </p><p>                  ------------------83A2F7  110846Z /38 </p><p>P 110843Z SEP 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 7046 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 HARARE 005003 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p>LONDON FOR CHARLES GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>USUN FOR HOLBROOKE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/11/10 </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, PREL, ECON, ZI, CG </p><p>SUBJECT:  NEW ZIMBABWE PARLIAMENT STILL FEELING ITS WAY </p><p> </p><p>FINANCE MINISTER SIMBA MAKONI DREW LOUD JEERS OF "SHAME, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  05003  03 OF 03  110846Z </p><p>SHAME" FROM MDC MEMBERS ON AUGUST 30 WHEN HE DISCLOSED </p><p>THAT THE GOZ HAD SPENT NEARLY US$200 MILLION ON ITS </p><p>INTERVENTION IN THE DROC.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>REAL ROLE FOR PARTY WHIPS </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) ANOTHER IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE WITH THIS </p><p>PARLIAMENT IS THE NEW PROMINENCE OF PARTY WHIPS.  IN </p><p>PREVIOUS PARLIAMENTS, WITH ZANU-PF\'S HUGE MAJORITY, </p><p>THERE WAS LITTLE CHANCE OF ANY MEASURE BEING DEFEATED. </p><p>IF SOME PARLIAMENTARIANS APPEARED TO WAIVER IN THEIR </p><p>SUPPORT OF A PARTICULAR BILL, ZANU-PF WOULD RELY </p><p>PRIMARILY ON SENIOR GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS TO APPLY THE </p><p>NECESSARY PRESSURE (EMMERSON MNANGAGWA, AS JUSTICE </p><p>MINISTER, WAS NOTABLE IN THIS ROLE).  NOW, WITH A </p><p>SIZEABLE OPPOSITION, THE POTENTIAL FOR DEFECTION IS MUCH </p><p>GREATER, AND INDIVIDUAL MPS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE </p><p>WILL HAVE POTENTIALLY GREATER BARGAINING POWER WITH </p><p>THEIR RESPECTIVE PARTIES.  HENCE, THERE IS A GREATER </p><p>NEED FOR THE WHIPS TO ENSURE THAT PARTY MEMBERS STAY IN </p><p>LINE AND VOTE WITH THE PARTY ON KEY MOTIONS AND BILLS. </p><p>BOTH ZANU-PF AND MDC HAVE ALREADY HAD TO REIGN IN </p><p>RECALCITRANT MPS FOR PUBLIC STATEMENTS THAT WENT AGAINST </p><p>PARTY POLICY. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) COMMENT:  ZIMBABWE\'S FIFTH PARLIAMENT IS STILL </p><p>GOING THROUGH A TUMULTUOUS INFANCY, AND IT IS LIKELY TO </p><p>HAVE MANY TANTRUMS BEFORE IT GROWS UP.  HOWEVER, IT IS </p><p>DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE EVEN A MORE MATURE PARLIAMENT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  05003  03 OF 03  110846Z </p><p>ALTERING GOVERNMENT POLICY ON KEY ISSUES SUCH AS LAND </p><p>RESETTLEMENT, ECONOMIC REFORM, AND MILITARY ENGAGEMENT </p><p>IN THE DROC.  ZANU-PF REMAINS IN FIRM CONTROL OF ALL THE </p><p>INSTRUMENTS OF GOVERNMENT, INCLUDING PARLIAMENT.  IF </p><p>NOTHING ELSE, THE REVITALIZED LEGISLATURE IS LIKELY TO </p><p>RAISE THE PROFILE OF ORDINARY CITIZENS\' CONCERNS, SUCH </p><p>AS PRICE INCREASES AND THE DECLINE IN GOVERNMENT </p><p>SERVICES.  THIS WILL INCREASE THE PRESSURE ON THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT TO GET ITS FINANCIAL HOUSE IN ORDER SO THAT </p><p>IT CAN AT LEAST START TACKLING PROBLEMS IN A MEANINGFUL </p><p>WAY BEFORE THE 2002 ELECTION SEASON.  PARLIAMENT RISKS </p><p>DISENCHANTING THE PUBLIC AND RELEGATING ITSELF TO </p><p>IRRELEVANCY, HOWEVER, IF IT CANNOT GET PAST THE STAGE OF </p><p>CONSTANT POLITICAL AND PERSONAL ATTACKS.  THE BUDGET </p><p>BATTLE LATER THIS YEAR WILL TEST THE NEW PARLIAMENT\'S </p><p>METTLE AND GIVE US A GOOD INDICATION OF WHETHER THIS </p><p>PARLIAMENT WILL HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON TURNING THE </p><p>COUNTRY AROUND. </p><p> </p><p>MCDONALD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
