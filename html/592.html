REF A\'S RE-DRAFT OF THE CROATIA HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>REPORT CONSTITUTES, IN OUR VIEW, A MAJOR AND AS YET </p><p>UNSUBSTANTIATED REORIENTATION OF THE DRAFT REPORT WE </p><p>SUBMITTED IN REF B. </p><p> </p><p>3.  IN LIGHT OF ALL THAT HAS HAPPENED IN CROATIA IN </p><p>1992, IT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE BY PICKING AND CHOOSING TO </p><p>"DOCUMENT" VIRTUALLY ANY CASE ONE WERE INCLINED TO </p><p>MAKE REGARDING THE HUMAN RIGHTS PERFORMANCE OF THE </p><p>CROATIAN GOVERNMENT.  OVERALL BALANCE WILL BE CRITICAL </p><p>TO THE CREDIBILITY OF THIS YEAR\'S REPORT.  IN OUR </p><p>DRAFT WE SOUGHT CAREFULLY TO STRIKE A BALANCE WHICH </p><p>ACCURATELY REFLECTS THE HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION IN </p><p>THIS COUNTRY OVER THE PAST YEAR. </p><p>4.  IN PARAGRAPH 11 OF REF A WE ARE ADVISED TO MAKE A </p><p>"SPECIAL EFFORT" TO DOCUMENT HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES BY </p><p>THE CROATS -- OTHERWISE THE STRONG U.S. INDICTMENT OF </p><p>SERBIAN ABUSES IN SERBIA AND BOSNIA-HERCEGOVINA WILL </p><p>SEEM LESS CREDIBLE.  IT IS POSSIBLE THAT WE </p><p>MISUNDERSTAND THE INTENT OF THIS REQUEST, BUT, FOR </p><p>THE RECORD, WE WOULD BE EXTREMELY UNCOMFORTABLE </p><p>TAKING SUCH A CALCULATED APPROACH TO DESCRIBING </p><p>CROATIA\'S HUMAN RIGHTS PERFORMANCE.  MORE PLAINLY </p><p>PUT, WE DON\'T THINK CROATIA\'S AND SERBIA\'S 1992 HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS REPORTS SHOULD BE DRAFTED OR CONSIDERED "IN </p><p>TANDEM." </p><p> </p><p>5.  THIS FORMERLY EVACUATED MISSION HAD ALMOST NO </p><p>FILES FROM THE FIRST HALF OF 1992 AND EXPERIENCED AN </p><p>ALMOST TOTAL CHANGEOVER OF PERSONNEL LAST SUMMER. </p><p>YET WE FULLY ACKNOWLEDGED, AND WE INCLUDED IN OUR </p><p>                   LIMITED OFFICIAL USE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                   LIMITED OFFICIAL USE </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  02863  01 OF 08  311857Z </p><p>DRAFT, SERIOUS HUMAN RIGHTS SHORTCOMINGS AND EVEN </p><p>ALLEGATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS, IN TERRITORY </p><p>CONTROLLED BY THE CROATIAN GOVERNMENT IN 1992.  IF </p><p>THE DEPARTMENT IS ABLE TO AUGMENT WHAT WE INCLUDED IN </p><p>OUR DRAFT WITH HARD EVIDENCE WHICH CASTS CROATIA\'S </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS PERFORMANCE IN A DIFFERENT LIGHT, THIS </p><p>SHOULD OBVIOUSLY BE DONE.  BUT WE WOULD LIKE TO STICK </p><p>WITH THE FACTS AND KEEP OUR FOCUS ON CROATIA. </p><p> </p><p>6.  MANY OBSERVERS OF THE CROATIAN SCENE, INCLUDING </p><p>HARSH CRITICS OF THE GOVERNMENT, WOULD TEND TO </p><p>DISMISS A GRATUITOUSLY SEVERE REPORT AS MERELY </p><p>REFLECTING A DEEP-SEEDED STATE DEPARTMENT BIAS </p><p>AGAINST CROATS.  WE HERE DO WHAT WE CAN TO CORRECT </p><p>THIS UNFORTUNATE MISPERCEPTION.  BUT A HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>REPORT OF REF A\'S ORIENTATION RUNS THE RISK OF BEING </p><p>REJECTED OUT OF HAND.  THIS IS NOT/NOT AN ARGUMENT </p><p>FOR NOT TAKING A TOUGH, OBJECTIVE VIEW OF THIS </p><p>VERY-IMPERFECT GOVERNMENT\'S HUMAN RIGHTS PERFORMANCE, </p><p>BUT WE SHOULD LIMIT OURSELVES TO THAT. </p><p> </p><p>END GENERAL COMMENTS ON REF B RE-DRAFT. </p><p>7.

THEY ESTABLISHED CONTROL OVER </p><p>A NUMBER OF AREAS WHERE CROATS OF SERBIAN NATIONALITY </p><p>WERE PREDOMINANT AS WELL AS OVER AREAS WHERE SERBS </p><p>HAD BEEN IN A MINORITY.  THE JNA WAS ASSISTED IN THIS </p><p>EFFORT BY PARAMILITARY FORCES WHO INVADED FROM SERBIA </p><p>AND FROM MONTENEGRO AND BY LOCAL SERBIAN IRREGULARS. </p><p>THESE UNITS WERE OFTEN ORGANIZED AND LED BY REGULAR </p><p>JNA OFFICERS OR THEIR SURROGATES AND ALL WERE </p><p>DIRECTLY SUPPLIED WITH WEAPONS AND AMMUNITION BY THE </p><p>JNA.// </p><p> </p><p>10.

MOST OF THESE, INSTITUTED </p><p>INFORMALLY OR AT LOCAL LEVELS, HAVE LONG SINCE CEASED </p><p>IN AREAS NOT STILL UNDER BOMBARDMENT FROM SERBIAN </p><p>FORCES IN BOSNIA.
