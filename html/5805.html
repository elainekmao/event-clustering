<p>UNCLAS SANAA 000331 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR NEA/PPD:DMACINNES AND JDAVIES, NEA/RA:BKEARY, NEA/ARP: </p><p>MMILLER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KDEM, KPAO, AFIN, KWMN, PHUM, YM, DEMOCRATIC REFORM </p><p>SUBJECT: FINAL REPORT: DEMOCRACY SMALL GRANT FOR THE CIVIC </p><p>DEMOCRATIC INITIATIVES SUPPORT FOUNDATION (CDF) </p><p> </p><p>REFS: A) STATE 187026 B) SANAA5295 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Summary : The Civic Democratic Initiatives Foundation </p><p>(CDF) conducted the "Democratic Initiatives Enhancement </p><p>Program: Voter Registration Education Project". It was a </p><p>media project campaign aimed to inform the people that their </p><p>old voter registration cards were no longer valid and </p><p>encouraged them to participate in the new registration. The </p><p>project has also raised awareness of targeted groups about </p><p>the importance of their registration in the coming </p><p>parliament election and to encourage male support for </p><p>women\'s registration. The campaign used radio, newspapers </p><p>and pamphlets, which were distributed to community local </p><p>leaders. This media project was based on three studies </p><p>conducted in preparation for a voter registration education </p><p>program. CDF conducted fourteen-week voter registration </p><p>education media campaign and a series of voter education </p><p>workshops from August to October 2002. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Media Campaign: CDF designed the program for </p><p>awareness-raising to have multiple strategies. For example </p><p>this program used national and local radio, newspapers and, </p><p>in the second component, direct contact with local council, </p><p>tribal, and religious leaders. </p><p>Each of the two activities targeted a particular audience. </p><p>The radio drama and comedy episodes\' main audiences were </p><p>rural women. For maximum outreach, each episode was </p><p>broadcast three times during the weekend twice each day. </p><p>Newspaper advertisements targeted the educated population of </p><p>major and secondary cities, thereby reinforcing at the </p><p>governorate levels the radio programs. The ads advised </p><p>readers that their old cards are invalid and urge support </p><p>for full family registration. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Radio Drama and Comedy Series Broadcasting: CDF </p><p>assisted six radio stations to produce a series of four </p><p>episodes. Each episode broadcast twice a day, three times a </p><p>week which made it clear that the old registration cards </p><p>were no longer valid and it stressed the importance of all </p><p>sectors of the community registering for the coming election </p><p>(targeting all Yemenis 18 and older with particular </p><p>attention to rural Yemeni and women). CDF used the most </p><p>popular radio program such as Kalam Fi al-Samim in </p><p>Hadramout, Ma Yesah Ela Asahieh in Aden, kalam Mozon in </p><p>Hodeidah, etc. Each station provided CDF with an evaluation </p><p>and impact assessment at the end of the project. These </p><p>indicated that the message of the project reached audiences. </p><p>All programs were broadcast in local dialects within the </p><p>context of drama or comedy, therefore reaching the target </p><p>audience, particularly the illiterate ones. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Newspaper Announcements and Articles: Twelve weekly </p><p>newspapers carried three-inch two-line announcements during </p><p>August.  Some ads were accompanied by articles. The total </p><p>newspaper run was 114 weekly and 70 daily announcements and </p><p>more than 18 articles. The ads had slightly different </p><p>messages each week in order to attract more attention. The </p><p>articles carried the message that the old registration is no </p><p>longer valid, and motivated readers to encourage all family </p><p>members, in the rural or urban areas, to register. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) Community Leaders Pamphlet: 50,000 copies of the </p><p>pamphlet were printed and distributed all over the country </p><p>through local councils and CDF volunteer network for </p><p>official and traditional community leaders including 6,664 </p><p>district level local council members and tribal and </p><p>religious leaders. The pamphlets covered areas where no </p><p>radio or TV transmissions are available.  The pamphlet </p><p>conveyed the message that the old cards are no longer valid </p><p>and provides information on the election terminology for the </p><p>new registration with reference to the election law. </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) Outcome:  Project\'s positive impact was more than </p><p>expected probably because it was one of only two projects </p><p>addressing the voter registration issue early on. CDF was </p><p>aware that registration is not enough; therefore, this </p><p>project worked on voter education to encourage Yemeni </p><p>voters, especially females, to vote in the 27 April 2003 </p><p>elections. The project used voters\' education in the general </p><p>context of comedy, drama and explanatory newspaper articles </p><p>instead of plain direct educational statements. The main </p><p>target audience for the project were villagers and women, </p><p>groups which historically receive the least attention from </p><p>media and public awareness programs. </p><p>HULL </p><p></p></div>
