(C) SUMMARY:  ON AUGUST 24, AMBASSADOR MCDONALD PAID </p><p>AN INTRODUCTORY VISIT TO NEW MINISTER FOR ENVIRONMENT </p><p>AND TOURISM FRANCIS NHEMA, WHO IS ONE OF THE YOUNGEST </p><p>MEMBERS OF THE NEW CABINET.  HAVING SPENT MOST OF THE </p><p>LAST 11 YEARS IN THE U.S. AND CANADA, NHEMA GENERALLY </p><p>SEES THE U.S.-ZIMBABWE RELATIONSHIP IN A POSITIVE LIGHT. </p><p>STILL LEARNING THE MINISTERIAL ROPES, HE ACKNOWLEDGED </p><p>THE EFFECTS OF THIS YEAR\'S POLITICAL VIOLENCE ON </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S TOURISM INDUSTRY, BUT HAD ONLY THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>LINE TO OFFER ON LAND REFORM.  ALTHOUGH ASSOCIATED WITH </p><p>THE YOUNGER GENERATION, NHEMA DOES NOT YET APPEAR TO </p><p>HAVE THE POLITICAL WHEREWITHAL OR PERSONALITY TO AFFECT </p><p>ANY REAL CHANGE IN CABINET.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR, ACCOMPANIED BY POLOFF AND </p><p>USAIDOFF, PAID AN INTRODUCTORY VISIT TO NEW MINISTER FOR </p><p>ENVIRONMENT AND TOURISM FRANCIS NHEMA.  NHEMA IS ONE OF </p><p>THE NEW YOUNG BLOODS IN CABINET, AND, AS HE TOLD US, IS </p><p>THE SECOND-YOUNGEST MEMBER AFTER YOUTH DEVELOPMENT </p><p>MINISTER BORDER GEZI.  THE SOFT-SPOKEN NHEMA INFORMED </p><p>THE AMBASSADOR THAT THIS IS HIS SECOND POSTING IN THE </p><p>ENVIRONMENT MINISTRY, WHERE HE WORKED IN THE 1980S AS A </p><p>SPECIAL ADVISOR TO THE VENERABLE VICTORIA CHITEPO (WIDOW </p><p>OF LIBERATION WAR HERO HERBERT CHITEPO), THEN </p><p>ENVIRONMENT MINISTER. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  04767  01 OF 03  291137Z </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>U.S.-ZIMBABWE RELATIONSHIP UNCHANGED </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR BEGAN THE DISCUSSION BY ASKING </p><p>NHEMA HOW HE ASSESSES THE U.S.-ZIMBABWE RELATIONSHIP. </p><p>THE MINISTER CONSIDERS IT ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED UNLESS </p><p>ONE CONSIDERS THE SUSPENSION OF IMF AND WORLD BANK </p><p>SUPPORT.  HE CHARACTERIZED IT AS BETTER THAN THE </p><p>RELATIONSHIP WITH THE U.K.  WHEN ASKED TO EXPLAIN THE </p><p>INCREASE IN ANTI-AMERICAN RHETORIC, NHEMA BLAMED MEDIA </p><p>BIAS AND THE BRITISH FOR COMING BETWEEN ZIMBABWE AND THE </p><p>U.S.  ZIMBABWEANS TEND TO LUMP THE U.S. AND U.K. </p><p>TOGETHER AS "THE WEST," SO WHEN THE BRITISH RELATIONSHIP </p><p>SUFFERS, THE AMERICAN ONE DOES AS WELL, NHEMA OFFERED. </p><p>THE AMBASSADOR ENCOURAGED NHEMA AND OTHER OFFICIALS TO </p><p>DISCUSS THEIR DIFFERENCES WITH THE U.S. PRIVATELY AND </p><p>NOT IN THE PRESS, TO WHICH NHEMA AGREED. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>TOURISM SUFFERS... </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) THE DISCUSSION TURNED TO TOURISM AND THE EFFECT </p><p>THIS YEAR\'S POLITICAL VIOLENCE HAS HAD ON THE INDUSTRY. </p><p>THE AMBASSADOR STATED THAT DESPITE ZIMBABWE\'S MANY </p><p>PROBLEMS, AMERICAN VISITORS CONTINUE TO COME TO THE </p><p>COUNTRY.  HOWEVER, AMERICANS ARE DIRECTED TO FOLLOW THE </p><p>STATE DEPARTMENT\'S TRAVEL ADVISORY BEFORE PLANNING THEIR </p><p>TRIP.  THE AMBASSADOR SAID A PUBLIC RELATIONS CAMPAIGN </p><p>TO PROMOTE ZIMBABWE TOURISM WOULD NOT BE EFFECTIVE SO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  04767  01 OF 03  291137Z </p><p>LONG AS SQUATTERS CONTINUE TO ILLEGALLY OCCUPY FARMS AND </p><p>INTIMIDATE THEIR OWNERS.   THE MINISTER ACKNOWLEDGED, </p><p>SOMEWHAT GRUDGINGLY, THAT THERE IS LITTLE HE CAN DO TO </p><p>IMPROVE ZIMBABWEAN TOURISM UNTIL THE LAND ISSUE IS </p><p>SETTLED.  BEFORE THE PROBLEMS DEVELOPED EARLIER THIS </p><p>YEAR, PROMOTING ZIMBABWE AS A TOURIST DESTINATION FOR </p><p>AMERICANS WAS AN IMPORTANT UNDERTAKING BY THE EMBASSY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>...WHILE LAND REFORM GRINDS ON </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) PARROTING THE GOVERNMENT LINE, NHEMA REITERATED </p><p>THAT THE FARM OCCUPIERS WERE TO BE OFF THE FARMS NOT </p><p>IDENTIFIED FOR COMPULSORY ACQUISTION BY THE END OF </p><p>SEPTEMBER AND THAT FIVE MILLION HECTARES WERE TO BE </p><p>REDISTRIBUTED BY DECEMBER.  OCCUPIERS ALREADY ON FARMS </p><p>DESIGNATED FOR REDISTRIBUTION WOULD BE ALLOWED TO </p><p>REMAIN, HOWEVER.  ASKED ABOUT THE EVICTIONS OF THE WEEK </p><p>OF AUGUST 21 (REFTEL), NHEMA SAID THE POLICE DID NOT </p><p>FOLLOW GOVERNMENT POLICY AS THOSE EVICTED DID NOT HAVE </p><p>OTHER LAND ON WHICH TO SETTLE.  THE AMBASSADOR POINTED </p><p>OUT THAT THE GOZ DOES NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES TO RESETTLE </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ5876 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  04767  02 OF 03  291138Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DODE-00  DOEE-00 </p><p>      DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  OES-01   ACE-00 </p><p>      SSO-00   SS-00    USIE-00  EPAE-00  IIP-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02 </p><p>      G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /004W </p><p>                  ------------------7F28FB  291138Z /38 </p><p>O 291137Z AUG 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 6952 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 HARARE 004767 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF, AF/S </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p>LONDON FOR CHARLES GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/29/05 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PINR, SENV, EIND, EAID, ZI </p><p> </p><p>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR CALLS ON NEW ENVIRONMENT MINISTER </p><p>FRANCIS NHEMA </p><p> </p><p>SO MANY PEOPLE IN SUCH A SHORT TIME.  UPHOLDING THE </p><p>PRINCIPLES OF THE OWNERSHIP OF PRIVATE PROPERTY AND RULE </p><p>OF LAW, IN THE U.S. VIEW, IS ESSENTIAL TO RESTORING </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  04767  02 OF 03  291138Z </p><p>INTERNATIONAL DONOR SUPPORT, AND, THUS, ENSURING </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S LAND REFORM PROGRAM IS A SUCCESS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) WHEN ASKED WHY THE GOZ SHOULD NOT REDISTRIBUTE </p><p>LAND GIVEN TO GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND CRONIES OVER THE </p><p>YEARS, NHEMA FLATLY DENIED THAT ANY LAND HAD BEEN GIVEN </p><p>TO GOVERNMENT MINISTERS, BUT DID NOT RULE OUT THAT </p><p>LOWER-LEVEL OFFICIALS HAD RECEIVED FARMS.  MOST </p><p>PROPERTIES WERE TOO SMALL FOR SENIOR GOVERNMENT </p><p>OFFICIALS, NHEMA EXPLAINED, AND EVEN IF THEY DID RECEIVE </p><p>FARMS, THEY WERE STILL LEASED FROM THE GOVERNMENT.  IF </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT PROVIDE INPUTS OR TRAINING TO </p><p>NEW FARMERS, IS IT NOT SETTING THEM UP FOR FAILURE? </p><p>SIDESTEPPING THE ISSUE, THE MINISTER RESPONSED THAT FOR </p><p>THE COMMUNAL FARMER, RESETTLEMENT IS "HEAVEN."  ALL HE </p><p>WANTS IS LAND.  WHAT ABOUT THE URBAN POOR WHO ARE MORE </p><p>INTERESTED IN FINDING JOBS THAN OBTAINING LAND?  EVERY </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN, ESPECIALLY URBAN DWELLERS, DREAM OF RETIRING </p><p>TO THEIR HOME AREAS TO FARM THEIR NATIVE SOIL, ACCORDING </p><p>TO NHEMA.  MORE AND MORE URBAN ZIMBABWEANS ARE APPLYING </p><p>FOR COMMUNAL LAND, BUT CANNOT GET IT BECAUSE OF </p><p>OVERCROWDED CONDITIONS IN THE COMMUNAL AREAS. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>U.S. HELP ON WILDLIFE PROTECTION </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) USAIDOFF BRIEFED THE ENVIRONMENT AND TOURSIM </p><p>MINISTER ON TWO PROGRAMS OF MUTUAL INTEREST.  THE </p><p>CAMPFIRE (COMMUNAL AREAS MANAGEMENT PROGRAM FOR </p><p>INDIGENOUS RESOURCES) PROGRAM WAS STARTED IN 1989 TO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  04767  02 OF 03  291138Z </p><p>HELP RURAL ZIMBABWEANS CONSERVE THEIR NATURAL RESOURCES </p><p>AND ACQUIRE INCOME FROM PROPER GAME MANAGEMENT.  THE </p><p>PROGRAM IS IN ITS FINAL TWO YEARS OF IMPLEMENTATON AND </p><p>MAJOR EFFORTS ARE UNDERWAY TO COMPLETE REMAINING </p><p>ACTIVITIES AND OBJECTIVES.  THE U.S. HAS PROVIDED $13 </p><p>MILLION TO THE WIDELY EMULATED PROGRAM SINCE ITS </p><p>INCEPTION, AND WILL BE LOOKING FOR CONTINUED GOZ </p><p>SUPPORT.  REGARDING CITES (CONVENTION ON INTERNATIONAL </p><p>TRADE IN ENDANGERED SPECIES OF FAUNA AND FLORA), THE </p><p>EMBASSY HAS SUPPORTED ZIMBABWE\'S ELEPHANT AND IVORY </p><p>POLICY.  IN ORDER TO CONTINUE THAT SUPPORT, IT IS </p><p>IMPORTANT FOR ZIMBABWE TO CONTINUE TO MANAGE ITS </p><p>WILDLIFE AND IVORY STOCKS IN A SUSTAINABLE MANNER. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>NOT A PLAYER YET </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) COMMENT: STILL LEARNING THE MINISTERIAL ROPES, </p><p>NHEMA STUCK CLOSELY TO THE GOVERNMENT SCRIPT ON LAND </p><p>REFORM BUT DID ACCEPT, SOMEWHAT GRUDGINGLY, THAT THE </p><p>TOURISM INDUSTRY WOULD CONTINUE TO SUFFER UNTIL THE LAND </p><p>ISSUE IS RESOLVED.  NHEMA ASKED QUESTIONS AND APPEARED </p><p>INTERESTED IN LEARNING THE U.S. POSITION ON A VARIETY OF </p><p>ISSUES.  WE SUSPECT THAT WITH HIS RELATIVE YOUTH, </p><p>WESTERN EDUCATION AND WORKING EXPERIENCE IN THE BANKING </p><p>INDUSTRY, NHEMA IS FULLY AWARE OF THE LINKAGES BETWEEN </p><p>GOVERNMENT-MOTIVATED POLITICAL VIOLENCE AND ECONOMIC </p><p>DECLINE.  HOWEVER, HE IS STILL TOO NEW TO THE CURRENT </p><p>GOVERNMENT TO GO OUT ON A LIMB.  IN ANY CASE, NHEMA DOES </p><p>NOT APPEAR TO HAVE THE POLITICAL WHEREWITHAL OR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  04767  02 OF 03  291138Z </p><p>PERSONALITY TO AFFECT ANY REAL CHANGE IN CABINET, AND WE </p><p>DO NOT EXPECT HIM TO WIELD MUCH INFLUENCE IN THE </p><p>ZIMBABWE GOVERNMENT ANY TIME SOON. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) BIO NOTE: FRANCIS NHEMA IS APPROXIMATELY 45 </p><p>YEARS OLD AND HAILS FROM THE SHURUGWI DISTRICT OF </p><p>MIDLANDS PROVINCE.  NHEMA WORKED IN THE ENVIRONMENT </p><p>MINISTRY BETWEEN 1985 AND 1989 AS A SPECIAL TOURISM </p><p>ADVISOR FOR VICTORIA CHITEPO, WHO WAS ENVIRONMENT </p><p>MINISTER AT THE TIME.  HE THEN WORKED AS A PUBLICIST IN </p><p>THE BANKING AND TOURISM INDUSTRIES IN NEW YORK, </p><p>WASHINGTON, AND OTTAWA, CANADA UNTIL ABOUT 1996.  NHEMA </p><p>RETURNED TO ZIMBABWE TO BECOME EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE </p><p>ZIMBABWE BUILDING SOCIETY (ZBS), THE FIRST INDIGENOUS </p><p>FIRM TO PROVIDE MORTGAGES TO LOW-INCOME HOUSING BUYERS. </p><p>ALLEGATIONS AROSE IN THE PRESS THAT NHEMA SIPHONED OFF </p><p>MILLIONS OF U.S. DOLLARS FROM ZBS FOR HIS PERSONAL USE. </p><p>CHARGES OF FRAUD WERE FILED, AND ALL BUT ONE WAS LATER </p><p>DROPPED.  ONE IS APPARENTLY STILL PENDING.  IN 1999, THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT BAILED ZBS OUT OF BANKRUPTCY, AND NHEMA LEFT </p><p>THE ORGANIZATION.  NHEMA RETURNED TO GOVERNMENT IN 2000 </p><p>AFTER HIS ELECTION TO PARLIAMENT FROM HIS NATIVE </p><p>MIDLANDS PROVINCE, AND WAS APPOINTED MINISTER IN JULY. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ5877 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  04767  03 OF 03  291138Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DODE-00  DOEE-00 </p><p>      DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  OES-01   ACE-00 </p><p>      SSO-00   SS-00    USIE-00  EPAE-00  IIP-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02 </p><p>      G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /004W </p><p>                  ------------------7F28FE  291138Z /38 </p><p>O 291137Z AUG 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 6953 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 HARARE 004767 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF, AF/S </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p>LONDON FOR CHARLES GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/29/05 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PINR, SENV, EIND, EAID, ZI </p><p> </p><p>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR CALLS ON NEW ENVIRONMENT MINISTER </p><p>FRANCIS NHEMA </p><p> </p><p>NHEMA IS MARRIED TO MATADI NHEMA, A DAUGHTER OF THE LATE </p><p>VICE-PRESIDENT JOSHUA NKOMO, AND IS A MEMBER OF ZANU-PF. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  04767  03 OF 03  291138Z </p><p> </p><p>MCDONALD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
