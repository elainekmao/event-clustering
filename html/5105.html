At the recent </p><p>talks, he said, the LTTE had pressed hard on the Jaffna </p><p>security zone issue.  An agreement was not reached, but </p><p>the two sides agreed to keep working on the matter.  For </p><p>the first time, the two sides discussed timelines, with </p><p>the GSL indicating it wanted a final settlement much </p><p>sooner than the LTTE.  Moragoda, who had just returned </p><p>from New Delhi, also expressed concern over what he </p><p>considered GoI divisions over how to handle Sri Lankan </p><p>policy.  Based on Moragoda\'s comments, much of the low </p><p>hanging fruit has been picked and he expects the peace </p><p>process to become increasingly difficult.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>A Pensive Moragoda </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) The Ambassador and DCM met January 13 with </p><p>Milinda Moragoda, the Sri Lankan Minister of Economic </p><p>Reform and a key player on peace process issues. </p><p>Moragoda had just returned to Colombo from India (see </p><p>Para 10) and before that Thailand where he had </p><p>participated in the fourth round of GSL talks with the </p><p>Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) (see Reftels). </p><p>Before Bangkok, Moragoda had also been in Japan for </p><p>several days. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Moragoda was pensive.  He also seemed very tired </p><p>and -- in a rarity for someone who usually has his act </p><p>together -- a bit disorganized.  Our guess is that the </p><p>heavy travel schedule had worn Moragoda down, but the </p><p>weight of all the issues he was dealing with also </p><p>appeared a factor.  (Note:  Moragoda has his hand in </p><p>virtually everything the government does, political, </p><p>military or economic.)  Discussing how busy he was, </p><p>Moragoda commented that Prime Minister Wickremesinghe </p><p>was planning a cabinet reshuffle soon and his </p><p>(Moragoda\'s) portfolios might be slimmed down.  If that </p><p>happened, Moragoda noted, he would be very happy. </p><p>(Note:  We have no further information about any cabinet </p><p>reshuffle.  In past conversations, Moragoda has </p><p>discussed possibly giving up his economic-related </p><p>responsibilities, so that he can concentrate on the </p><p>peace process.) </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>The Fourth Round </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Providing a brief readout of the recently </p><p>concluded talks, Moragoda indicated that they had gone </p><p>relatively well.  The big issue had been how to handle </p><p>the Sri Lankan military\'s "high security zones" in </p><p>Jaffna.  The LTTE had pressed very hard for a reduction </p><p>in the size of the security zones.  For its part, the </p><p>GSL had stressed that it could not agree to do this </p><p>without a symmetrical and verifiable Tiger commitment to </p><p>disarmament of cadre that might enter military-vacated </p><p>areas.  (Note:  The Tigers have refused to discuss </p><p>disarmament at this time.)  Given the disagreement over </p><p>the security zone issue, the two sides had ultimately </p><p>decided to focus on resettling displaced persons (IDPs) </p><p>who had points of origin from outside the area of the </p><p>camps.  (Note:  The government estimates that about </p><p>300,000 IDPs are from Jaffna areas located outside of </p><p>the camps and 40,000 are from inside areas that are now </p><p>taken up by the camps.  The LTTE disputes these </p><p>figures.) </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) In the meantime, Moragoda noted, the two sides </p><p>had also agreed to continue discussing the security </p><p>zones.  At this time, both sides were waiting for a </p><p>report being prepared by Satish Nambiar, a retired </p><p>Indian general, on the issue.  (Note:  Moragoda said </p><p>Nambiar had been asked to prepare the report by the GSL. </p><p>Nambiar, he added, was being paid by the Indian </p><p>government, with some expenses reimbursed by the Sri </p><p>Lankan government.)  The government was getting </p><p>indications that Nambiar\'s report would "split the </p><p>difference," i.e., providing for some relocations and </p><p>reductions in the security zone network, but not </p><p>outright withdrawal. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Looking at how the security zone issue was </p><p>handled, Moragoda concluded that the government had </p><p>probably made a mistake in releasing the military\'s </p><p>proposal on the security zone issue publicly before it </p><p>was provided to the LTTE.  (Note:  The military\'s </p><p>report, which was prepared by Jaffna Army commander </p><p>Major General Fonseka, was publicized in late December </p><p>-- see Reftels)  The report had clearly angered the </p><p>Tigers, who found it inflexible.  They also objected to </p><p>its use of terms like "terrorist" when referring to the </p><p>LTTE.  The use of such terms had led the Tigers to </p><p>accuse the GSL of not exercising control over the </p><p>military.  Moragoda commented that the report was the </p><p>"proximate cause" of the Tiger decision to withdraw from </p><p>the "Sub-Committee on De-Escalation and Normalization." </p><p>(Note:  The LTTE announced earlier this month that it </p><p>would no longer participate in this sub-committee, </p><p>preferring to discuss security issues in the political- </p><p>level talks.  The decision was a setback for the peace </p><p>process.) </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>Timeline of a Possible Settlement </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) On the margins of the talks, Moragoda related </p><p>that he had had an interesting colloquy with LTTE senior </p><p>negotiator Anton Balasingham on timelines for a possible </p><p>final settlement of the conflict.  This was the first </p><p>time the two sides had discussed this issue, he </p><p>confided.  Moragoda said he told Balasingham that the </p><p>government wanted to wrap things up as quickly as </p><p>possible, preferably within the next 6-8 months. </p><p>Balasingham replied that the LTTE had a much longer </p><p>timeline in mind, stretching two-and-a-half years.  The </p><p>LTTE negotiator indicated that this timeline was </p><p>predicated on a point where President Kumaratunga was </p><p>out of office or on her way out.  (Note:  Kumaratunga\'s </p><p>term ends in early 2006, with the next presidential </p><p>election slated to take place in December 2005.)  The </p><p>LTTE, Balasingham indicated, did not trust her and did </p><p>not want a final settlement agreed to when Kumaratunga </p><p>still was in any position to undermine it. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) In explaining the different timelines, Moragoda </p><p>went on to add that the Tigers appeared quite satisfied </p><p>with the on-the-ground pace of the peace process.  The </p><p>government, however, felt the need to show political </p><p>gains in ending the war, in addition to moving forward </p><p>with improvements in the on-the-ground situation. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) Queried about Balasingham\'s health, Moragoda </p><p>replied that he did not look good.  Moragoda said he </p><p>(Moragoda) was really worried about the future of the </p><p>peace process if something happened to Balasingham.  It </p><p>was not clear whether the LTTE had anyone available who </p><p>could take his place.  (Note:  Balasingham has had a </p><p>long-standing kidney condition, which requires constant </p><p>medical attention.  Concerns about his health have </p><p>reportedly led to the postponement of Balasingham\'s </p><p>planned trip to LTTE-controlled northern Sri Lanka, </p><p>which was slated to begin after the conclusion of the </p><p>recent talks.) </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>Visit to New Delhi </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) Shifting gears, Moragoda provided a brief </p><p>readout on his recent visit to India.  In New Delhi, he </p><p>said he had briefed GoI officials, including External </p><p>Affairs Minister Sinha and National Security Advisor </p><p>Mishra, on the outcome of the talks.  Moragoda felt that </p><p>his meetings had gone well and that India was on board </p><p>with the peace process.  That said, Moragoda expressed </p><p>concerns over what he saw as a disconnect in the GoI </p><p>over how to handle policy toward Sri Lanka.  According </p><p>to Moragoda, the MEA seemed to favor a "go slow" </p><p>approach, not wanting the GoI to take too prominent a </p><p>role as regards Sri Lanka.  Mishra, however, seemed to </p><p>want India to assume a more energetic posture.  Moragoda </p><p>said he was not sure how the apparent difference in </p><p>emphasis would shake out, but it potentially could prove </p><p>problematic for Sri Lanka down the road.  Per Reftels, </p><p>Moragoda added that GoI officials continued to express </p><p>concerns about Japan\'s heightened interest in Sri Lanka. </p><p>The recent visit of Foreign Minister Kawaguchi to New </p><p>Delhi had not allayed Indian concerns about the GoJ\'s </p><p>higher profile, he said. </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>Other Issues </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) The meeting also touched on the following </p><p>issues: </p><p> </p><p>-- Cohabitation:  Regarding the always-testy </p><p>relationship between the government and the president, </p><p>Moragoda said he was scheduled to brief Kumaratunga on </p><p>peace process issues fortnightly.  He felt that </p><p>Kumaratunga\'s attitude toward the peace process was </p><p>highly ambiguous:  she did not want to be seen as </p><p>opposing the process, but she also wanted to keep the </p><p>government off-balance, so as to gain political </p><p>advantage. </p><p> </p><p>-- Muslim Meltdown:  Moragoda could not conceal his low </p><p>opinion of Rauf Hakeem, the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress </p><p>(SLMC) leader.  Hakeem was a poor politician who had </p><p>alienated virtually everyone, including the Prime </p><p>Minister.  In fact, Moragoda said he could now count at </p><p>least four separate SLMC factions.  Hakeem had made a </p><p>hash out of his participation in the fourth round of </p><p>talks, earning a stern lecture from Balasingham, who </p><p>warned him to stop interjecting so-called "Muslim </p><p>issues" into the talks.  (Note:  Hakeem was re-elected </p><p>leader of the SLMC shortly after his return from the </p><p>Thailand talks.  Only pro-Hakeem SLMC delegates were </p><p>allowed to attend the party meeting where the election </p><p>was held.) </p><p> </p><p>-- Donor Conference:  The international donor conference </p><p>hosted by Japan would take place June 15-16. </p><p> </p><p>-- UN Voting:  He reacted in a positive manner to a </p><p>request that the U.S. and the GSL work together to </p><p>improve Sri Lanka\'s UN voting record.  He said he would </p><p>call Permrep Mahendran in New York on the issue and </p><p>report back. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) Based on Moragoda\'s comments, much of the low </p><p>hanging fruit has been picked and he clearly expects the </p><p>peace process to become increasingly difficult.  In our </p><p>estimation, he could well be right.  The way forward </p><p>will probably be particularly rough for the GSL, which </p><p>is at pains to show some sort of "peace dividend" to its </p><p>constituents.  The LTTE, of course, does not have </p><p>similar worries given its authoritarian ways.  In </p><p>addition, per Moragoda\'s straightforward statement to </p><p>Balasingham that the government wants to come to terms </p><p>as soon as possible, the LTTE probably has a legitimate </p><p>reason to feel that it has the upper hand at this point. </p><p>Indeed, Moragoda seemed to indicate to us that the GSL </p><p>was not going to go to the mat over the security zone </p><p>issue.  At the same time, handling the negotiations is a </p><p>difficult calculus for the LTTE.  If it really wants the </p><p>process to work, the LTTE cannot afford to embarrass the </p><p>government too much.  That would only redound to the </p><p>advantage of those who are skeptical about the peace </p><p>process in the south.  In light of these confusing ins </p><p>and outs, it is no wonder that Moragoda seemed tired and </p><p>out-of-sorts.  That said, the GSL leadership is going to </p><p>have to rise to the occasion in the coming months if it </p><p>is going to see the process through.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>13. (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
