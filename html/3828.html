This periodic U.S. Mission Economic Report </p><p>includes: </p><p>-- Nigeria\'s Debt Management Office Ready to Sign </p><p>Bilateral Paris Club Agreement </p><p>-- President Sponsors Bill to Give States Offshore Oil </p><p>Revenue </p><p>-- Supplemental Budget Bill Has Little Chance of </p><p>Passage </p><p>-- NITEL to Face Competition in Telecom Sector </p><p>-- Oil Workers Strike Causes Short-lived Gasoline </p><p>Shortages </p><p>-- Nigeria Airways: Sold or Not Sold? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GON CLOSE TO SIGNING USG BILATERAL DEBT ACCORD </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) According to Nigeria\'s Debt Management Office </p><p>(DMO), the GON is close to signing the bilateral Paris </p><p>Club debt accord with the USG.  DMO Director General </p><p>Akin Arikawe told Econoffs the agreement needed the </p><p>approval of the Federal Executive Council (FEC), and </p><p>predicted FEC assent by late October.  Because Arikawe </p><p>and many key players from the Central Bank and </p><p>Ministry of Finance will be in Washington in early </p><p>October, there may be an additional delay in </p><p>finalizing the agreement.  We think mid-November may </p><p>be a more likely.time-frame for the signing ceremony. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PRESIDENT SPONSORS BILL TO GIVE STATES OFFSHORE OIL </p><p>REVENUE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) In early September, President Obasanjo </p><p>submitted a bill to the Senate (but not to the House </p><p>of Representatives, according to the Speaker\'s office) </p><p>defining the contiguous offshore zone of a state--for </p><p>revenue sharing purposes--as part of that state.  As </p><p>such, offshore oil revenue would be calculated as part </p><p>of the derivation fund (Ref B).  In essence, the bill </p><p>would restore the states bordering the Gulf of Guinea </p><p>to the status quo prior to the April 5, 2002 Supreme </p><p>Court ruling that offshore resources were not part of </p><p>the territory of individual states.  That decision </p><p>took away the 13 percent of revenues that states with </p><p>oil and gas facilities in adjacent water had been </p><p>receiving. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU)  Comment: The new resource allocation bill </p><p>has been depicted by the media as a conciliatory </p><p>gesture toward the South-South to retain support for </p><p>the executive in the upcoming elections.  While the </p><p>bill may have some support in the Senate, getting it </p><p>through the House may be more arduous given the </p><p>stronger opposition to Obasanjo in that Chamber. </p><p>Another complication is that passage of the bill will </p><p>require members from non-oil producing States to </p><p>forego the additional revenue their states and the </p><p>Federal Government gained at the expense of these </p><p>maritime states.  Prospects are further complicated by </p><p>the nature of the legislative fix proposed.  Many </p><p>constitutional experts believe the two-paragraph </p><p>proposal to redefine offshore production as onshore </p><p>production would not pass court review.  They argue </p><p>that the Supreme Court has ruled definitively on the </p><p>issue, and to change the effect of the ruling requires </p><p>a constitutional amendment, with the requisite but </p><p>unlikely approval of two-thirds of the State </p><p>legislatures.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SUPPLEMENTAL BUDGET: "A NON-ISSUE" FOR LEGISLATORS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) On September 10, President Obasanjo submitted a </p><p>236 billion Naira (almost USD $2 billion) supplemental </p><p>budget to the National Assembly.  The budget included </p><p>21 billion Naira in spending on recurrent items, 92 </p><p>billion Naira on capital projects and 124 billion </p><p>Naira on external debt service. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Introduced on the heels of impeachment </p><p>charges tin the National Assembly based in part on the </p><p>accusation that Obasanjo had failed to implement the </p><p>2002 budget, the supplemental budget has not been well </p><p>received by lawmakers in Abuja.  Several House members </p><p>told Emboffs that the supplementary budget will not </p><p>pass. One quipped, "It is a non-issue." He added that </p><p>maybe one or two items might get through, particularly </p><p>additional funding for the Independent National </p><p>Electoral Commission (INEC), but that the rest are </p><p>repackaged unimplemented items from previous budgets. </p><p>Lawmakers also said that there was no need for a </p><p>supplementary budget with the President due to present </p><p>the 2003 budget to the National Assembly within a </p><p>month.  One noted that even if a supplemental budget </p><p>were passed, they had little confidence that it would </p><p>be implemented. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GON TO SELL TRACTOR, TRUCK, NEWSPRINT, AND SUGAR FIRMS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) Despite the failure of core investors to </p><p>raise needed funds for the privatization of NITEL in </p><p>March 2002 and the shipbuilding company Nigerdock in </p><p>August 2002, the Bureau of Public Enterprise (BPE) is </p><p>moving forward with the sale of four more state-owned </p><p>enterprises.  The BPE has invited qualified core </p><p>investors to bid on the 51 percent controlling </p><p>interest in the Bauchi tractor and equipment </p><p>manufacturer, Steyr Nigeria Limited; the Kano truck </p><p>assembler, National Trucks Manufacturers Limited; the </p><p>Savannah Sugar Company in Adamawa State; and the </p><p>Nigerian Newsprint Manufacturing Company in Akwa Ibom </p><p>State.  The 49 percent balance of the government\'s </p><p>equity in each firm is to be sold subsequently on the </p><p>Nigerian Stock Exchange. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) BPE claims that National Trucks can produce </p><p>7,000 trucks and 3,000 tractors in a year and Steyr, </p><p>8,000 trucks, 2,000 tractors, and 500 generators. </p><p>Savanah Sugar is reported to own 30,000 hectares of </p><p>land (12,000 arable), with claimed output of 100,000 </p><p>metric tons of sugar annually, while Nigerian </p><p>Newsprint has capacity to produce 100,000 metric tons </p><p>of newsprint per year. All four companies are in poor </p><p>financial shape and have been operating at below their </p><p>stated capacity for years. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C)  Comment:  Little income is expected from the </p><p>sale of these four firms.  Nevertheless, their </p><p>successful sale would be important for restoring </p><p>political momentum for privatization after the NITEL </p><p>and NigerDock sales fell through.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NITEL TO FACE COMPETITION IN TELECOM SECTOR </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) On August 30, 2002, the Nigerian </p><p>Communications Commission (NCC) approved Globalcom </p><p>Limited\'s National Operator license to operate as a </p><p>national carrier with digital mobile, international </p><p>gateway, and fixed wireless services.  Globalcom, a </p><p>local firm headed by Lagos businessman Chief Mike </p><p>Adenuga, was the only bidder out of four to pay the </p><p>nonrefundable deposit of $20 million by the August 6 </p><p>deadline.  On August 12, Globalcom paid an additional </p><p>$180 million to the NCC to meet the $200 million price </p><p>of the license. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU) Comment: Globalcom\'s entry into the </p><p>telecommunications sector, especially after its much </p><p>publicized exclusion from the GSM (cellular) market, </p><p>should bring much-needed competition to NITEL. </p><p>Competition has already brought price cuts in the </p><p>wireless sector.  Prices remain high by international </p><p>standards, however, not because the GSM tariffs are </p><p>high - they in fact are below international averages - </p><p>but because the interconnectivity charge with NITEL is </p><p>six times the world average.  This major problem </p><p>demonstrates a need to strengthen the Nigerian </p><p>Communications Commission (NCC) as an effective </p><p>regulator capable of enforcing minimum standards of </p><p>service - a point with which even some NITEL officials </p><p>are privately in agreement.  Meanwhile, the draft </p><p>national telecommunications law, which would go a long </p><p>way toward accomplishing this, languishes in the </p><p>National Assembly.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>OIL WORKERS STRIKE CAUSES SHORT-LIVED GASOLINE </p><p>SHORTAGES </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.(U) PENGASSAN, Nigeria\'s white collar oil and gas </p><p>workers union, and the blue-collar Nigerian Union of </p><p>Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers (NUPENG), held a </p><p>one-day "warning strike" on September 23 to protest </p><p>the planned privatization of the Nigerian National </p><p>Petroleum Corporation (NNPC).  Oil tanker drivers </p><p>(affiliated with NUPENG) stopped transporting gasoline </p><p>from September 20-23. The strike had been scheduled to </p><p>last through Tuesday, September 24, but was called off </p><p>a day earlier following the reported intervention of </p><p>Minister of Employment and Productivity Alhaji Musa </p><p>Gwadabe. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (U) In Lagos, most gasoline stations had </p><p>sufficient reserves to continue pumping gasoline </p><p>during the strike, though some refused to do so for </p><p>fear of NUPENG reprisals. In other parts of Nigeria, </p><p>the impact was more severe, some lines at the pumps </p><p>reaching more than one kilometer. We have heard no </p><p>report of violence associated with the strikes and, as </p><p>of September 25, lines at fuelling stations were </p><p>returning to normal. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NIGERIA AIRWAYS: SOLD OR NOT SOLD? </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. (SBU) The future of Nigeria Airways and its </p><p>international routes remains unclear as newly-minted </p><p>Air Nigeria failed to assume the New York-Lagos route </p><p>on September 19 (reftel C).  Minister of Aviation Kema </p><p>Chikwe had announced sale of 49 percent of Nigeria </p><p>Airways to London-based Airwing Aerospace Limited </p><p>(AAL) provoking an angry reaction from the Bureau of </p><p>Private Enterprises (BPE), which had plans to sell the </p><p>heavily indebted company.  What ensued was an </p><p>acrimonious public exchange between the Minister and </p><p>BPE Director General Nasir El-Rufai. The Presidency </p><p>named a five-person committee headed by the Vice </p><p>President to find a way for the two sides to reach a </p><p>compromise. </p><p>15. (SBU) Comment: Minister Chikwe\'s AAL deal was </p><p>unusual to say the least.  The Ministry of Aviation, </p><p>not the Federal Government of Nigeria, holds the </p><p>controlling 51 percent of the new Air Nigeria.  AAL is </p><p>company with no known experience running an airline. </p><p>AAL planned to begin Air Nigeria by contracting </p><p>Singapore Airlines to handle New York-Lagos flights on </p><p>a wet lease.  As noted in reftel C, this would not </p><p>have been possible on September 20 as contracted as </p><p>neither AAL nor the Ministry of Aviation had taken </p><p>necessary administrative steps for the new company to </p><p>begin U.S. operations.  Both Chikwe and El-Rufai </p><p>reportedly got the word from Aso Rock to cool their </p><p>rhetoric.  The sale remains in limbo and may not be </p><p>sorted out until after the elections. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
