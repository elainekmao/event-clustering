<p>UNCLAS RANGOON 000355 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV AND DRL/IL </p><p>USPACOM FOR FPA </p><p>LABOR FOR ILAB </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ELAB, PHUM, BM, Human Rights </p><p>SUBJECT: LABOR MINISTER REJECTS ILO ACTION PLAN </p><p> </p><p>REF: RANGOON 300 </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU)  COM Martinez met with Labor Minister Tin Winn on </p><p>March 18 to encourage greater Burmese cooperation with the </p><p>ILO on forced labor.  Specifically, the COM urged the </p><p>Minister to accept Rangoon ILO Liaison Officer Ms. </p><p>Perret-Nguyen\'s recommendations for a plan of action to be </p><p>presented at the ILO Governing Body on March 26-27.  While </p><p>Tin Winn said he has worked closely with Ms. Perret-Nguyen on </p><p>the proposed plan of action, his government could not accept </p><p>elements of the plan that she deemed essential for a </p><p>minimally acceptable presentation to the GB.  Tin Winn said </p><p>his government would not accept the concept of a "mediator" </p><p>empowered to receive and follow-up complaints regarding </p><p>forced labor.  He also rejected the idea of a pilot region </p><p>where forced labor would be strictly prohibited and </p><p>alternatives explored because, as envisioned by the ILO, the </p><p>mediator would play a central role in the pilot region. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  Responding to COM\'s recommendation that the </p><p>government\'s implementation committee against forced labor </p><p>needed a representative from the army (the largest user of </p><p>forced labor in the country), Tin Winn said the government </p><p>considered putting a representative from the military </p><p>Inspector General\'s office on the Committee but decided a </p><p>military intelligence officer with experience in </p><p>international relations would be more appropriate.  Minister </p><p>Tin Winn said the Burmese government has adequate mechanisms </p><p>in place for receiving and investigations of complaints of </p><p>forced labor and adequate laws for prosecution when </p><p>necessary.  The Labor Minister emphasized that the GOB will </p><p>continue to focus on public awareness campaigns to ensure </p><p>that citizens understand that forced labor is not legal.  He </p><p>dismissed the COM\'s comments that most victims of forced </p><p>labor remained fearful of reporting abuses. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU)  Later the same day, ILO Liaison Officer Ms. </p><p>Perret-Nguyen told COM that, on the eve of her departure for </p><p>the GB meeting in Geneva, she was very discouraged by the </p><p>government\'s intransigence on even the minimal elements </p><p>necessary for a meaningful plan of action.  Ms. Perret-Nguyen </p><p>said the GOB appears to have reached a critical juncture on </p><p>the issue of forced labor; it does not know how to wean </p><p>itself off of a dependency on forced labor yet it is </p><p>unwilling to allow the ILO, or any outsiders, the necessary </p><p>access to help solve the problem.  She said that in a meeting </p><p>on March 5th, the Labor Minister asked if GOB acceptance of </p><p>the two minimally required elements she was proposing to </p><p>include in the action plan would satisfy the GB.  When she </p><p>responded that the GB would probably ask for more steps to be </p><p>taken (but she would work together with the GOB to address </p><p>these concerns), the Minister said that there was no </p><p>incentive for the GOB to accept these minimal elements if </p><p>more requirements were to follow.  Perret-Nguyen said that </p><p>the Minister appeared to be in the difficult position of </p><p>attempting to appease the ILO without allowing real changes </p><p>(i.e., greater transparency) that he knew Senior General Than </p><p>Shwe and other memebrs of the military leadership would </p><p>reject.  As it stands now, she said, she cannot endorse the </p><p>government\'s plan and she expects that the GB will be quite </p><p>critical of it. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
