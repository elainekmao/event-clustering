<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 003135 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SECSTATE FOR DAS LIZ CHENEY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/28/2010 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, SCUL, OEXC, OIIP, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: ELECTION SUPPORT ACTIVITIES </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Haynes Mahoney, PA </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary.  In the three remaining weeks before the June </p><p>17 Parliamentary elections the Mission is coordinating with </p><p>MEPI-funded NGOs, including the National Democratic Institute </p><p>(NDI) and the International Republican Institute (IRI) to </p><p>strengthen the electoral process and traditions, to encourage </p><p>participation by women and youth, and to ensure that the </p><p>elections are as transparent and fair as possible.  We are </p><p>sensitive to that fine line between the need to inform the </p><p>GOJ of USG-funded activities while encouraging the Jordanian </p><p>officials to allow maximum leeway for non-governmental </p><p>activity aimed at strengthening the elections\' credibility. </p><p>In his meetings with the Ambassador and with the PAO and </p><p>USAID Director Planning Minister Bassem Awadullah has been </p><p>generally supportive of our election programming, expressing </p><p>the caveat that it should be low profile, lest --as he told </p><p>the PAO and USAID Director-- Islamists with an anti-U.S. </p><p>agenda claim that the USG is trying to skew the election </p><p>results. So far, both the Mission\'s Public Affairs Section </p><p>and the U.S. NGOs have been able to conduct a number of </p><p>activities such as advising female candidates, training </p><p>journalists on election coverage, and providing fora in which </p><p>candidates can debate and convey their message to the </p><p>electorate.  These activities have all been conducted under </p><p>the auspices of Jordanian civic organizations. End summary. </p><p> </p><p>Supporting Women Candidates </p><p> </p><p>2. (U)  Both the Mission and the NGOs have supported </p><p>Jordanian women who are running for the six women\'s quota </p><p>seats or hoping to beat male candidates outright.  Public </p><p>Affairs arranged the program of U.S. campaign manager Daryl </p><p>Glenny who counseled 18 out of the 36 registered female </p><p>candidates during her IIP-sponsored May 18-27 visit.  In </p><p>individual sessions arranged by the Jordanian National </p><p>Women\'s Forum, Ms. Glenny advised the candidates --who </p><p>represented the full political spectrum-- on shaping their </p><p>messages and maximizing their resources in the final stages </p><p>before election day.  PA has also given the National Women\'s </p><p>Forum a grant to fund a phone bank, enabling any female </p><p>candidate who wishes to canvass her constituents by phone. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Simultaneously NDI in cooperation with the Women\'s </p><p>Forum, a Jordanian NGO, raised funds from the Canadian </p><p>Embassy and some local corporations to produce TV spots and </p><p>SMS mobile phone text messages urging voters to elect women. </p><p>There was some initial misunderstandings among some Jordanian </p><p>NGO leaders who thought that NDI was funding individual </p><p>candidates, but their representatives told the Mission that </p><p>they have since clarified that the TV spots and SMS messages </p><p>are strictly generic.  NDI hopes that two Jordanian TV </p><p>stations and possibly one Arab satellite broadcaster will air </p><p>the messages.  They likewise plan to develop a manual for </p><p>women candidates in future elections and to support media </p><p>training by the Women\'s Media Center, a Jordanian NGO.  NDI </p><p>is also contacting international media and encouraging them </p><p>to focus on the high level of activity by female candidates </p><p>in this conservative, male-oriented society. </p><p> </p><p>Engaging the Electorate </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) To focus Jordanian journalists on the "so-what" aspect </p><p>of their reporting about the elections, PA is funding an </p><p>ongoing three-day workshop featuring the IIP-sponsored </p><p>American journalism professor Tom Warhover and an Egyptian </p><p>counterpart.  The training, which is being conducted by an </p><p>NGO --the Jordanian Committee for the Defense of the Freedom </p><p>of Journalists-- will focus on reporting skills plus the </p><p>legal and political environment and will include hands-on </p><p>training in the form of interviews  and coverage of a debate </p><p>between actual candidates. NDI and IRI both plan on "town </p><p>meetings" and other fora enabling candidates to debate and </p><p>answer the electorate\'s questions.  Working with the local </p><p>branch of Transparency International, NDI is organizing a </p><p>local NGO which will assess the election environment and </p><p>possibly lay the groundwork for a future monitoring </p><p>organization. IRI also plans on assessing voter priorities </p><p>and motivations through an exit poll conducted by a local </p><p>Jordanian organization. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) Election apathy has been a particular problem among </p><p>Jordanian youth.  Using MEPI funds, the IRI therefore plans </p><p>to hold three "mock parliaments," for university-age students </p><p>in different regions under the auspices of the Princess Basma </p><p>Youth Resources Center --an "NGO" associated with the Royal </p><p>Court. Similarly, NDI plans to hold a televised "town hall </p><p>meeting" between candidates and youth, which they hope will </p><p>be broadcast on JTV. </p><p> </p><p>Modest but Hopeful Expectations </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Jordanians expect turnout to be modest for the </p><p>elections, an expectation confirmed by casual conversations. </p><p>Among the elite business community, students and workers the </p><p>question is: "What can the Parliament do for me?"  Many doubt </p><p>that the government will allow the truly qualified opposition </p><p>politicians to run or be elected, and there are many </p><p>complaints about the skewed delineation of election districts </p><p>to disadvantage the urban and Palestinian voters.  The most </p><p>hopeful aspect, in many Jordanians\' eyes, are the six women\'s </p><p>quota seats, for which there is a high level of competition </p><p>and public interest. </p><p> </p><p>(C) Nevertheless, assuming the elections are perceived to be </p><p>relatively transparent and fair compared to the last </p><p>elections of 1997, where stuffed ballots and other </p><p>irregularities were common, they could be a positive step </p><p>towards representative government.  Our Mission activities </p><p>and those by the MEPI-supported NGOs aim at providing </p><p>candidates, especially women, with campaigning skills and at </p><p>awakening an interest among the youth. We hope our activities </p><p>will pave the way for increased participation in future </p><p>elections.  Also, the holding of relatively free and fair </p><p>elections soon after the Iraq war and just prior to the June </p><p>21-23 World Economic Forum will send an important message </p><p>about Jordanian stability and commitment to democratic </p><p>progress. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
