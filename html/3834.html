<p>UNCLAS HARARE 002174 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PD, AF/S, AF/RA </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION MEP; HARARE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under headline "Genocide in Palestine" the ZANU </p><p>      PF weekly organ "The People\'s Voice" dedicated its </p><p>      September 29 editorial to accusing the Israeli Prime </p><p>      Minister Ariel Sharon of "committing genocide" against </p><p>      the Palestinian people.  The editorial also denounced </p><p>      President Bush for "sheltering such a murderous and </p><p>      genocidal regime." Excerpts follow: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   ". . . The Israeli Army has occupied all the </p><p>      towns in the Palestinian territory, demolished </p><p>      Arafat\'s office bloc in Ramallah, and is continuously </p><p>      and systematically demolishing dwelling houses and </p><p>      killing people living in them, including women and </p><p>      children.  Mr. Sharon and his army are obviously </p><p>      committing genocide. </p><p> </p><p>      "The only reason why Mr. Sharon is not at The </p><p>      Hague\'s International Tribunal to answer charges </p><p>      of genocide is the support he has from President </p><p>      George Bush of the USA and his Government.  It </p><p>      is surprising that a President who is so </p><p>      committed to fighting terrorism, and to promote </p><p>      good governance in the world should be </p><p>      sheltering such a murderous and genocidal </p><p>      regime.  It is now the time for all the members </p><p>      of the United Nations, and all the six regions </p><p>      of the world, to speak out loudly and clearly </p><p>      against both Mr. Sharon and his supporter, Mr. </p><p>      Bush.  All the statements against terrorism lose </p><p>      credibility if the worst example of terrorist </p><p>      (Sharon) remains behind the American umbrella." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
