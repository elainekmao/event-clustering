IRVING FOR </p><p>REASONS: 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SINCE FEBRUARY 1, THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE </p><p>(GOZ) HAS INTENSIFIED AND EXPANDED THE SCOPE OF ITS </p><p>INTIMIDATION CAMPAIGN IN URBAN AREAS.  IT HAS SENT ARMY </p><p>AND POLICE UNITS INTO TOWNSHIPS NEAR HARARE TO </p><p>INDISCRIMINATELY BEAT PEOPLE IN THEIR HOMES AND PUBLIC </p><p>PLACES.  ON FEBRUARY 3, POLICE SQUASHED A SMALL, BUT </p><p>PEACEFUL DEMONSTRATION AGAINST MEDIA ATTACKS WITH </p><p>OVERWHELMING POLICE FORCE.  ON FEBRUARY 4 AND 5 IT BEGAN </p><p>TARGETING PROMINENT MEMBERS OF THE OPPOSITION MDC FOR </p><p>BEATINGS AND ARREST.  THE GOZ\'S LEVEL OF INTIMIDATION IS </p><p>NOW HIGHER THAN AT ANY TIME SINCE LAST YEAR\'S PRE- </p><p>ELECTION PERIOD.  IF THE GOZ SUCCESSFULLY CLAMPS DOWN ON </p><p>THE OPPOSITION AS A POLITICAL FORCE, OPPOSITION SOURCES </p><p>FEAR EXTREMIST MEMBERS OF THE URBAN POPULACE MAY RESORT </p><p>TO ISOLATED ACTS OF VIOLENCE TO VENT THEIR ANGER.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>RENEWAL OF INDISCRIMINATE BEATINGS </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00655  01 OF 02  061625Z </p><p>2.  (C) ON THE NIGHT OF FEBRUARY 1, ARMY AND POLICE </p><p>UNITS DESCENDED ON CHITUNGWIZA, THE SPRAWLING TOWNSHIP </p><p>30 KM SOUTH OF HARARE, TO BEAT RESIDENTS, APPARENTLY AT </p><p>RANDOM.  "THE DAILY NEWS" REPORTED THAT SOLDIERS STORMED </p><p>SEVERAL NIGHTCLUBS AND CLUBBED PARTY-GOERS WITH BATONS, </p><p>ACCUSING THEM OF BURNING COPIES OF THE GOVERNMENT- </p><p>INFLUENCED "THE HERALD."  IN ANOTHER INCIDENT, SOLDIERS </p><p>REPORTEDLY RAIDED A RESTAURANT, ORDERED ALL THE PATRONS </p><p>TO THE FLOOR, AND BEAT THEM WITH BATONS FOR 15 MINUTES. </p><p>AN EMBASSY SOURCE CONFIRMED THAT MILITARY, NOT POLICE, </p><p>VEHICLES WERE SEEN ALL OVER CHITUNGWIZA THE NIGHT OF </p><p>FEBRUARY 1.  SOLDIERS RETURNED TO ONE NIGHTCLUB IN THE </p><p>HIGH-DENSITY AREA ON FEBRUARY 4 AND AGAIN BATTERED ITS </p><p>PATRONS, ACCORDING TO THE PRESS.  THE ATTACKS FOLLOWED A </p><p>WEEK OF TENSION AND VIOLENCE INVOLVING VENDORS OF THE </p><p>AFOREMENTIONED RIVAL NEWSPAPERS, WHICH WAS PRECIPITATED </p><p>BY THE BOMBING OF "THE DAILY NEWS" PRINTING PLANT ON </p><p>JANUARY 28 (REFTEL). </p><p> </p><p>PEACEFUL DEMONSTRATIONS BROKEN UP </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) ON FEBRUARY 2, POLICE USED BATONS AND TEAR GAS </p><p>TO BREAK UP A DOWNTOWN HARARE DEMONSTRATION BY ABOUT 100 </p><p>MDC YOUTHS, WHO WERE PROTESTING THE BREAKDOWN OF LAW AND </p><p>ORDER IN THE COUNTRY.  POLICE CHASED AND BEAT UP THE </p><p>DEMONSTRATORS UNTIL THEY DISPERSED, ACCORDING TO PRESS </p><p>REPORTS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) THE ZIMBABWE UNION OF JOURNALISTS (ZUJ) MET ON </p><p>THE EVENING OF FEBRUARY 2 TO ORGANIZE A DEMONSTRATION IN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00655  01 OF 02  061625Z </p><p>DOWNTOWN HARARE THE NEXT DAY TO PROTEST THE BOMBING OF </p><p>"THE DAILY NEWS" AND OTHER GOVERNMENT ABUSE OF THE </p><p>INDEPENDENT MEDIA.  ZANU-PF SUPPORTERS VISITED THE </p><p>MEETING IN AN ATTEMPT TO INTIMIDATE THE GATHERED </p><p>JOURNALISTS, BUT THEY WERE EVENTUALLY EXPELLED, </p><p>ACCORDING TO AN EMBASSY SOURCE.  EARLY ON FEBRUARY 3, </p><p>BEFORE THE 100 OR SO JOURNALISTS COULD BEGIN THEIR </p><p>DEMONSTRATION IN FRONT OF THE AMBASSADOR HOTEL, ABOUT </p><p>250 RIOT POLICE HAD ALREADY GATHERED AND ORDERED THE </p><p>JOURNALISTS TO DISPERSE.  THE ZUJ LEADERS CALLED OFF THE </p><p>PLANNED DEMONSTRATION, SAYING THEY HAD NO CHANCE AGAINST </p><p>THE POLICE AND WOULD "LIVE TO FIGHT ANOTHER DAY," </p><p>ACCORDING TO PRESS REPORTS. </p><p> </p><p>ARMY AND POLICE TARGET MDC LEADERS </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) "THE DAILY NEWS" REPORTED THAT IN THE EARLY </p><p>MORNING HOURS OF FEBRUARY 5, MEN IN ARMY UNIFORMS BROKE </p><p>INTO THE HOME OF JOB SIKHALA, THE MDC SECRETARY FOR </p><p>SECURITY AND MP FOR ST. MARY\'S, AND BEAT HIM SEVERELY. </p><p>SIKHALA\'S SISTER AND MAID WERE REPORTEDLY STRUCK WITH </p><p>CHAINS.  SIKHALA MANAGED TO ESCAPE BY HIDING IN AN </p><p>OUTDOOR TOILET.  THE SOLDIERS REPORTEDLY WANTED FROM </p><p>SIKHALA INFORMATION ABOUT THE MDC\'S PRESIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ6763 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  00655  02 OF 02  061625Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00  INL-00 </p><p>      DINT-00  DODE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00 </p><p>      FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00 </p><p>      LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01 </p><p>      OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00 </p><p>      IRM-00   SSO-00   STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00 </p><p>      PRM-01   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /010W </p><p>                  ------------------C1ADA1  061626Z /38 </p><p>O 061626Z FEB 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 8178 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 000655 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR CHARLES GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>NAIROBI FOR TERRY PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/06/11 </p><p>TAGS:  PHUM, PGOV, PINS, PINR, ZI </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  00655  02 OF 02  061625Z </p><p>SUBJECT: ZIMBABWE GOVERNMENT EXTENDS CRACKDOWN ON </p><p>OPPOSITION </p><p> </p><p>ELECTION STRATEGY.  IN A FEBRUARY 6 MEETING, THE HARARE </p><p>DATT ASKED ARMY AND AIR FORCE OFFICERS ABOUT THE </p><p>MILITARY\'S SUPPOSED INVOLVEMENT IN SIKHALA\'S BEATING. </p><p>ONE ARMY OFFICER SAID NO SOLDIERS WERE DEPLOYED TO ST. </p><p>MARY\'S, BUT ADMITTED THAT THE NATIONAL REACTION FORCE, </p><p>WHICH COMPRISES SOLDIERS AND POLICEMEN, WAS INVOLVED. </p><p>THE OFFICER STRESSED THAT ALL MEMBERS OF THE NRF WEAR </p><p>THE SAME UNIFORM, IMPLYING THAT IT WAS POLICEMEN WHO </p><p>CONDUCTED THE RAID. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) ON FEBRUARY 5, POLICE ARRESTED THE MDC\'S </p><p>NATIONAL YOUTH CHAIRMAN, NELSON CHAMISA, AND CHARGED HIM </p><p>WITH INCITING VIOLENCE AT RALLIES IN HARARE\'S HIGH- </p><p>DENSITY SUBURBS OF GLEN NORAH AND KAMBUZUMA THE PREVIOUS </p><p>WEEK.  CHAMISA WAS BOOKED AT WATERFALLS POLICE STATION, </p><p>BUT WAS LATER TRANSFERRED TO A LOCATION THAT THE POLICE </p><p>REFUSED TO DISCLOSE, MDC SECRETARY-GENERAL WELSHMAN </p><p>NCUBE TOLD US.  NCUBE SAID THAT CHAMISA TOLD HIM THAT HE </p><p>WAS AFRAID WE WOULD BE TAKEN TO GOROMONZI PRISON AND </p><p>TORTURED.  CHAMISA WAS LATER LOCATED AT HARARE CENTRAL </p><p>PRISON AND IS DUE TO APPEAR IN COURT FEBRUARY 7.  WHILE </p><p>ADDRESSING SUPPORTERS IN HARARE ON FEBRUARY 4, CHAMISA </p><p>HAD CRITICIZED THE MILITARY AND POLICE FOR BEATING UP </p><p>INNOCENT PEOPLE IN HARARE\'S HIGH-DENSITY SUBURBS THE </p><p>PREVIOUS WEEK. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) THE FEBRUARY 6 "THE HERALD" REPORTED THAT POLICE </p><p>ARRESTED MDC VICE-PRESIDENT GIBSON SIBANDA ON FEBRUARY 5 </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00655  02 OF 02  061625Z </p><p>FOR INCITING VIOLENCE AT AN MDC RALLY AT BULAWAYO\'S </p><p>WHITE CITY STADIUM THE PREVIOUS DAY.  SIBANDA, WHO WAS </p><p>ACCOMPANIED BY LAWYER AND MDC MP DAVID COLTART, WAS </p><p>BRIEFLY QUESTIONED, CHARGED WITH INCITING VIOLENCE, THEN </p><p>RELEASED, WELSHMAN NCUBE TOLD US.  THE POLICE ARE ALSO </p><p>CONSIDERING PRESSING CHARGES AGAINST NCUBE HIMSELF, WHO </p><p>ALSO SPOKE AT THE RALLY.  NCUBE STATED THAT SIBANDA\'S </p><p>REMARKS WERE MISQUOTED BY "THE HERALD" AND TWISTED </p><p>AROUND BY THE POLICE.  SIBANDA HAD REALLY STATED THAT </p><p>"WE MUST DEFEND OURSELVES, THAT IT IS RIGHT TO ACT IN </p><p>SELF-DEFENCE," AND THAT "IT\'S NOT UNLAWFUL TO HIT (WAR </p><p>VETERANS LEADER) CHENJERAI HUNZVI IF HE HITS YOU FIRST," </p><p>ACCORDING TO NCUBE. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) THE LEVEL OF GOZ-SPONSORED INTIMIDATION IS NOW </p><p>HIGHER THAN AT ANY TIME SINCE LAST YEAR\'S PRE-ELECTION </p><p>PERIOD.  THE SCOPE AND INTENSITY OF THE INTIMIDATION </p><p>CAMPAIGN, AND THE INCREASING INVOLVEMENT OF MILITARY </p><p>UNITS, IS A FLASHING SIGN OF THE GOZ\'S GROWING </p><p>DESPERATION--AND DETERMINATION--TO DEFEAT THE MDC.  WE </p><p>ARE HEARING RUMORS THAT MUGABE MAY RESIGN AS EARLY AS </p><p>APRIL THIS YEAR AND CALL A SNAP ELECTION THAT WOULD </p><p>CATCH THE MDC OFF-GUARD.  SUCH A MOVE IS PLAUSIBLE, </p><p>CONSIDERING THE INTENSITY OF THE CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE </p><p>MDC\'S STRONGHOLDS AND THE MDC ITSELF.  A CAMPAIGN OF </p><p>URBAN VIOLENCE WAS THE FINAL STAGE IN THE GOZ\'S WAVE OF </p><p>INTIMIDATION IN THE RUN-UP TO LAST YEAR\'S PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>ELECTIONS.  IT IS DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE THE GOZ </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00655  02 OF 02  061625Z </p><p>MAINTAINING THIS LEVEL OF VIOLENCE IN THE URBAN AREAS </p><p>WITHOUT RISKING A GREATER BACKLASH FROM URBAN RESIDENTS, </p><p>WHO WILL BE KEY TO ANY PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.  HOWEVER, </p><p>IF THE GOZ SUCCESSFULLY CLAMPS DOWN ON THE OPPOSITION </p><p>AND DESTROYS IT AS A POLITICAL FORCE, WHICH APPEARS TO </p><p>BE ITS INTENTION, OUR CONTACTS IN THE OPPOSITION FEAR </p><p>THAT EXTREMIST MEMBERS OF THE OPPOSITION OR URBAN </p><p>POPULACE MAY RESORT TO ISOLATED, RANDOM ACTS OF VIOLENCE </p><p>TO VOICE THEIR ANGER.  WE CANNOT RULE OUT THE KILLING OF </p><p>POLICE OR ARMY OFFICERS, OR EVEN ATTEMPTS ON THE LIVES </p><p>OF GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, IN THE NEAR- TO MEDIUM-TERM. </p><p>WE DO NOT, HOWEVER, ANTICIPATE THAT FOREIGNERS WILL BE </p><p>THE TARGETS OF THESE ACTS.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
