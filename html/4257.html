SINCE THE BREAKUP OF THE SOVIET UNION, </p><p>VIETNAM\'S TIES WITH RUSSIA HAVE EVOLVED FROM CLIENT STATE TO </p><p>A RELATIONSHIP BASED ON " MUTUAL PRACTICALITY AND </p><p>PRAGMATISM."  POLITICAL AND DEFENSE TIES STILL COUNT, BUT </p><p>THE ECONOMIC RELATIONSHIP APPEARS INCREASINGLY IN THE </p><p>FOREFRONT.  THE RETURN OF THE RUSSIAN BASE AT CAM RANH BAY </p><p>PROCEEDED SMOOTHLY WITHOUT ANY APPARENT NEGATIVE IMPACT ON </p><p>THE BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP.  VIETNAMESE STILL CONSIDER </p><p>RUSSIA A GOOD PLACE FOR ADVANCED STUDIES.  ONE RELATIVELY </p><p>MINOR BUMP IN THE ROAD AHEAD IS THE STATUS OF THE VIETNAMESE </p><p>COMMUNITY RESIDENT IN RUSSIA.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>BILATERAL AGREEMENTS, STEADY STREAM OF VISITS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  WHILE NO LONGER A CLIENT STATE AS IN THE DAYS OF </p><p>THE SOVIET UNION, VIETNAM STILL CONSIDERS RUSSIA A </p><p>"TRADITIONAL" (I.E., LONG-TIME) FRIEND.  A NOVEMBER 7 "NHAN </p><p>DAN" (PEOPLE\'S DAILY) PRESS REPORT COMMEMORATING THE 85TH </p><p>ANNIVERSARY OF THE OCTOBER REVOLUTION STRESSED THAT, AS AN </p><p>OFFICIAL FROM THE RUSSIA-VIETNAM FRIENDSHIP ASSOCIATION HAD </p><p>TOLD GENERAL SECRETARY OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF VIETNAM </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02709  01 OF 05  080503Z </p><p>(CPV) NONG DUC MANH DURING HIS OCTOBER VISIT (REF A), "WHILE </p><p>VIETNAM IS CHANGING, THE WARM SENTIMENT BETWEEN THE RUSSIAN </p><p>AND VIETNAMESE PEOPLE WILL NOT CHANGE."

(U)  NGUYEN QUANG MINH, SENIOR EXPERT IN THE MINISTRY OF </p><p>FOREIGN AFFAIR\'S (MFA) EUROPE I DEPARTMENT, POINTED TO THE </p><p>"LONG AND STEADY" COOPERATION BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES AS </p><p>EVIDENCE OF THIS CONTINUITY.  WHILE ACKNOWLEDGING A "BRIEF </p><p>DOWNTURN" FOLLOWING THE COLLAPSE OF THE SOVIET UNION, MINH </p><p>SAID THE "TRADITIONAL RELATIONSHIP" GOT BACK ON TRACK WITH </p><p>THE SIGNING OF A TREATY GOVERNING BILATERAL TIES IN JUNE </p><p>1994, AS WELL AS JOINT STATEMENTS ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF </p><p>ECONOMIC, COMMERCIAL, SCIENTIFIC, AND TECHNICAL COOPERATION </p><p>AND ON A BILATERAL "STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP" IN 1997.  VIETNAM </p><p>AND RUSSIA SIGNED AN AGREEMENT ON MILITARY AND TECHNICAL </p><p>COOPERATION IN 1998, HE ADDED.  THE NOVEMBER 7 "NHAN DAN" </p><p>REPORT OBSERVED THAT THE BILATERAL AGREEMENTS HAVE SERVED TO </p><p>"STABILIZE THE RELATIONSHIP AND ASSIST VIETNAM IN </p><p>INDUSTRIALIZATION AND MODERNIZATION." </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  IN ADDITION TO THESE MAJOR AGREEMENTS, THERE HAS </p><p>BEEN A STEADY STREAM OF HIGH LEVEL VISITS SINCE THE MID- </p><p>1990S.  ON THE GVN SIDE, THEN-FOREIGN MINISTER NGUYEN MANH </p><p>CAM VISITED IN 1993; THEN-PRIME MINISTER VO VAN KIET IN </p><p>1994; CAM AGAIN IN 1998 BUT AS THEN-DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER; </p><p>PRESIDENT TRAN DUC LUONG  IN 1998; PRIME MINISTER PHAN VAN </p><p>KHAI IN 2000; FOREIGN MINISTER NGUYEN DY NIEN IN 2001; AND </p><p>MANH IN OCTOBER 2002. </p><p> </p><p>5.

A KEY DELIVERABLE FROM PRESIDENT PUTIN\'S VISIT WAS </p><p>THE CANCELLATION OF 85 PERCENT OF VIETNAM\'S ESTIMATED DEBTS </p><p>OF USD 11 BILLION OWED TO RUSSIA FROM THE VIETNAM WAR ERA, </p><p>WITH THE REMAINING 15 PERCENT TO BE REPAID IN THE FORM OF </p><p>BARTER TRADE SPREAD OVER 2000-2023.  PRIME MINISTER </p><p>KASYANOV\'S MARCH 2002 VISIT WAS NOTEWORTHY FOR THE SIGNING </p><p>OF SIX AGREEMENTS, WHICH WERE MORE CONCRETE VERSIONS OF </p><p>AGREEMENTS IN PRINCIPLE DISCUSSED DURING PRESIDENT PUTIN\'S </p><p>MARCH 2001 VISIT.  THESE INCLUDED AGREEMENTS ON (1) HEALTH </p><p>CARE AND MEDICINE; (2) BORDER DEFENSE; (3) LAW ENFORCEMENT </p><p>INFORMATION EXCHANGE; (4) HYDRO-METEOROLOGY; (5) A LOAN FOR </p><p>HYDROELECTRIC PLANT CONSTRUCTION IN VIETNAM\'S CENTRAL </p><p>HIGHLANDS; AND (6) A FRAMEWORK FOR NUCLEAR ENERGY RESEARCH. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>WE MUST BE PRACTICAL </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  VLADIMIR TOKMAKOV, RUSSIAN EMBASSY FIRST </p><p>SECRETARY, DESCRIBED HOW BOTH SIDES VIEW THE RELATIONSHIP IN </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>TERMS OF "MUTUAL PRACTICALITY."  BOTH HE AND THE NGUYEN MANH </p><p>HUNG, DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE CPV CENTRAL COMMITTEE\'S </p><p>COMMISSION FOR EXTERNAL RELATIONS, SAID SEPARATELY THAT THE </p><p>BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP IS NOW "MATURE" AND HAD EVOLVED INTO </p><p>ONE WHERE BOTH SIDES PRIMARILY CONSIDER "THEIR OWN </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 05        HANOI  02709  01 OF 05  080503Z </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ8797 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HANOI  02709  02 OF 05  080504Z </p><p>ACTION EAP-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   A-00     CA-01    CCO-00 </p><p>      CEA-01   CG-00    CIAE-00  COME-00  CTME-00  INL-00   DINT-00 </p><p>      DOEE-00  ITCE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EXME-00 </p><p>      EUR-00   OIGO-00  E-00     FAAE-00  FBIE-00  UTED-00  VC-00 </p><p>      FRB-00   H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   INSE-00  ITC-01   LAB-01 </p><p>      L-00     VCE-00   MOFM-05  MOF-01   M-00     AC-01    NRCE-00 </p><p>      NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OCS-03   OES-00   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00 </p><p>      PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SCT-00   SP-00    SSO-00 </p><p>      SS-00    STR-00   TEST-00  TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00  USSS-00 </p><p>      SA-00    ASDS-00  EPAE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-02 </p><p>      G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /019W </p><p>                  ------------------0546AF  080504Z /38 </p><p>R 080447Z NOV 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HANOI </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 8055 </p><p>INFO AMCONSUL HO CHI MINH CITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY MOSCOW </p><p>ASEAN COLLECTIVE </p><p>USCINCPAC HONOLULU HI </p><p>SECDEF WASHDC//ISA/ACHAO// </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 05 HANOI 002709 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV, EUR/RUS </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  02709  02 OF 05  080504Z </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>INTERESTS."  TOKMAKOV ADDED THAT RELATIONS HAVE BECOME "MORE </p><p>PRAGMATIC" THAN IN THE SOVIET DAYS.  FROM THE RUSSIAN </p><p>PERSPECTIVE, FOREIGN POLICY PRAGMATISM EMANATES FROM </p><p>RUSSIA\'S CHANGED POSITION IN A MULTI-POLAR WORLD, TOKMAKOV </p><p>CONTINUED.  "WE NO LONGER NEED MILITARY BASES AND WE\'RE NO </p><p>LONGER A MAJOR WORLD POWER," HE CONCLUDED.  HE ASSESSED </p><p>RUSSIA\'S OVERALL RELATIONSHIP WITH VIETNAM AS "WARM AND </p><p>BASED ON MUTUAL BENEFIT."  TOKMAKOV ALSO CITED THE THREE </p><p>MOST RECENT MAJOR VISITS - THE 2001 PUTIN VISIT, THE 2002 </p><p>KASYMANOV VISIT, AND THE RECENTLY CONCLUDED MANH VISIT -  AS </p><p>"PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT," NOT NECESSARILY BECAUSE OF </p><p>SPECIFIC RESULTS OR AGREEMENTS, BUT RATHER BECAUSE OF THE </p><p>"ENDURING PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS" THEY HAVE INSPIRED AMONG </p><p>THE LEADERSHIP OF BOTH SIDES.  TOKMAKOV OPINED THAT IT IS </p><p>IMPORTANT FOR THE LEADERSHIP "JUST TO MEET REGULARLY - </p><p>FRIENDLY TALKS CAN SOLVE MANY PROBLEMS." </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU)  THE ASSESSMENT OF DR. BUI HUY KHOAT, DIRECTOR OF </p><p>THE INSTITUTE OF EUROPEAN STUDIES OF THE NATIONAL CENTRE FOR </p><p>SOCIAL SCIENCES AND HUMANITIES, PARALLED THAT OF EMBOFF </p><p>TOKMAKOV.  DR. KHOAT SAID THAT PERHAPS THE BIGGEST CHANGE IS </p><p>THAT THE "OLD SOVIET" RELATIONSHIP WAS BASED ON A "STRATEGIC </p><p>ALLIANCE," WHEREAS THE "NEW" RELATIONSHIP IS BASED MORE ON </p><p>"ECONOMIC BENEFITS AND NEW REALITIES."  VIETNAM AND RUSSIAN </p><p>BOTH VIEW EACH OTHER IN TERMS OF THEIR POTENTIAL MARKETS, HE </p><p>CLAIMED.  DR. KHOAT PREDICTED THAT THIS TREND WILL BE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02709  02 OF 05  080504Z </p><p>EVIDENT OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS, ASSUMING THE ECONOMIES OF </p><p>BOTH COUNTRIES CONTINUE TO DEVELOP.  HE EXPRESSED A HOPE </p><p>THAT RUSSIA, WHICH RANKS NINTH IN FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN </p><p>VIETNAM (MOSTLY IN PETROLEUM SECTOR) WOULD "WORK HARD TO </p><p>IMPROVE ITS STANDING IN THAT AREA" STILL FURTHER.  (NOTE: </p><p>ON PAPER, RUSSIAN INVESTMENT IS AHEAD OF THAT FROM THE U.S. </p><p>-- WHICH IS TECHNICALLY IN 15TH PLACE AMONG FOREIGN SOURCES </p><p>OF INVESTMENT -- BUT MUCH US INVESTMENT, INCLUDING IN THE </p><p>PETROLEUM SECTOR, COMES FROM US SUBSIDIARIES IN THE REGION </p><p>AND SHOWS UP AS THIRD COUNTRY INVESTMENT, IN PARTICULAR FROM </p><p>SINGAPORE.  END NOTE) </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU)  SERGEY ISAIEV, POL/C AT THE UKRAINE EMBASSY, </p><p>SEPARATELY ASSESSED THAT THE RUSSIANS AND VIETNAMESE ARE </p><p>VIEWING EACH OTHER THROUGH A "PRISM OF PRAGMATISM."  ISAIEV </p><p>SAID THAT UKRAINE IS INTERESTED IN FOLLOWING THE RUSSIA - </p><p>VIETNAM RELATIONSHIP BECAUSE "TO AN EXTENT, WE ARE </p><p>COMPETITORS AND NO ONE IS GIVING GIFTS THESE DAYS."  ISAIEV </p><p>NOTED, HOWEVER, THAT, SINCE PUTIN CAME TO POWER, THERE </p><p>APPEARED TO BE RENEWED RUSSIAN INTEREST IN SOUTHEAST ASIA IN </p><p>GENERAL AND VIETNAM IN PARTICULAR.  HE POINTED TO A </p><p>REORGANIZATION IN THE RUSSIAN MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS </p><p>THAT RESULTED IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF TWO NEW DEPARTMENTS </p><p>FOCUSED ON SOUTHEAST ASIA.  SEPARATELY, S.K. KALRA, FIRST </p><p>SECRETARY OF THE INDIAN EMBASSY, DESCRIBED THE RUSSIA - </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>VIETNAM RELATIONSHIP AS ANOTHER MANIFESTATION OF VIETNAM\'S </p><p>GENERAL WORLD OUTLOOK "TO BE FRIENDS WITH ALL COUNTRIES" AND </p><p>SEEK IMPROVED ECONOMIC RELATIONSHIPS AROUND THE WORLD (REF </p><p>C). </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02709  02 OF 05  080504Z </p><p>MILITARY COOPERATION STILL A FACTOR </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU)  DR. KHOAT NOTED THAT, WHILE MILITARY-TO-MILITARY </p><p>COOPERATION IS STILL A FACTOR IN THE RELATIONSHIP, THIS </p><p>ASPECT IS LIKELY TO "REMAIN MODEST FOR THE FORESEEABLE </p><p>FUTURE."  DR. KHOAT SUGGESTED THAT RUSSIA WOULD NONETHELESS </p><p>REMAIN AN IMPORTANT SOURCE FOR MILITARY SUPPLIES AND WEAPONS </p><p>(ALBEIT NOT THE MOST MODERN OR HIGH-QUALITY) "AT A </p><p>REASONABLE PRICE."  DR. KHOAT POINTED TO THE OCTOBER VISIT </p><p>TO RUSSIA OF A VIETNAMESE MILITARY SEARCH AND RESCUE </p><p>DELEGATION (REF A) AS AN EXAMPLE OF THIS TYPE OF ENDURING </p><p>COOPERATION.  DR. KHOAT ADDED THAT WHILE VIETNAM "MIGHT </p><p>PREFER" TO OBTAIN HIGHER QUALITY MATERIEL FROM EUROPE, ITS </p><p>EXISTING INVENTORY AND INFRASTRUCTURE WILL REMAIN TIED TO </p><p>THE RUSSIAN STANDARD FOR "MANY YEARS."  INDIAN EMBOFF KALRA </p><p>SEPARATELY NOTED THAT VIETNAM (LIKE INDIA) "WILL BE </p><p>MILITARILY TIED TO THE RUSSIANS" FOR MANY YEARS.  IN </p><p>ADDITION, THE HIGH COST OF EUROPEAN MATERIAL IS ANOTHER </p><p>FACTOR KEEPING VIETNAM IN THE RUSSIAN MILITARY MARKET. </p><p>WITHOUT GOING INTO DETAILS, THE CPV\'S HUNG ADMITTED THAT </p><p>THERE ARE "REGULAR" EXCHANGES BETWEEN THE TWO MILITARIES AND </p><p>THAT EACH YEAR "SOME" VIETNAMESE MILITARY OFFICERS RECEIVE </p><p>ADVANCED TRAINING IN RUSSIA. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU)  ON A STRATEGIC LEVEL, INDIAN EMBOFF KALRA OPINED </p><p>THAT RUSSIA AND VIETNAM WILL CONTINUE TO SHARE A MUTUAL </p><p>INTEREST.  RUSSIA VIEWS VIETNAM, EVEN AFTER HANDING OVER THE </p><p>BASE AT CAM RANH BAY, AS A FOOTHOLD IN SOUTHEAST ASIA; </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 05        HANOI  02709  02 OF 05  080504Z </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ8798 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HANOI  02709  03 OF 05  080504Z </p><p>ACTION EAP-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   A-00     CA-01    CCO-00 </p><p>      CEA-01   CG-00    CIAE-00  COME-00  CTME-00  INL-00   DINT-00 </p><p>      DOEE-00  ITCE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EXME-00 </p><p>      EUR-00   E-00     FAAE-00  FBIE-00  UTED-00  VC-00    FRB-00 </p><p>      H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   INSE-00  ITC-01   LAB-01   L-00 </p><p>      VCE-00   MOFM-05  MOF-01   M-00     AC-01    NRCE-00  NSAE-00 </p><p>      NSCE-00  OCS-03   OES-00   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00 </p><p>      PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SCT-00   SP-00    SSO-00   SS-00 </p><p>      STR-00   TEST-00  TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00  USSS-00  SA-00 </p><p>      ASDS-00  EPAE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-02   G-00 </p><p>      NFAT-00  SAS-00     /019W </p><p>                  ------------------0546BA  080504Z /38 </p><p>R 080447Z NOV 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HANOI </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 8056 </p><p>INFO AMCONSUL HO CHI MINH CITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY MOSCOW </p><p>ASEAN COLLECTIVE </p><p>USCINCPAC HONOLULU HI </p><p>SECDEF WASHDC//ISA/ACHAO// </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 03 OF 05 HANOI 002709 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV, EUR/RUS </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  02709  03 OF 05  080504Z </p><p> </p><p>VIETNAM VIEWS ITS STRONG RELATIONSHIP WITH RUSSIA AS A </p><p>COUNTERBALANCE TO THE PRC\'S LONG SHADOW.

(SBU)  THE RUSSIAN EMBASSY\'S TOKMAKOV AND THE MFA\'S </p><p>MINH SAID SEPARATELY THAT THE PUSH FOR MUTUAL ECONOMIC </p><p>BENEFIT IS THE CURRENT FOCUS OF BOTH COUNTRIES.  FOR </p><p>EXAMPLE, MOST PRESS REPORTS FROM THE KASYMANOV AND MANH </p><p>VISITS FOCUSED ON ECONOMIC ISSUES, INCLUDING HOW TO IMPROVE </p><p>TWO-WAY TRADE, ANNOUNCEMENTS OF JOINT VENTURE PROJECTS, AND </p><p>A CALL FOR VIETNAMESE ENTREPRENEURS TO "WORK HARDER TO FIND </p><p>A MARKET NICHE IN RUSSIA." </p><p> </p><p>12.  (SBU)  ARGUABLY, COOPERATION IN THE ENERGY FIELD IS THE </p><p>BIGGEST SINGLE TICKET ITEM IN THE ECONOMIC SECTOR.  THE </p><p>VIETNAM-SOVIET OIL AND GAS JOINT VENTURE, (VIETSOVPETRO, </p><p>WHICH IS A HOLDOVER FROM THE DAYS WHEN ONLY THE SOVIETS WERE </p><p>ALLOWED TO "INVEST" IN THE ENERGY SECTOR) EARNS USD 300-500 </p><p>MILLION PER YEAR, ACCORDING TO PRESS REPORTS.  DURING THE </p><p>VISIT OF PM KASYANOV LAST MARCH, THE TWO SIDES ANNOUNCED </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02709  03 OF 05  080504Z </p><p>PLANS TO EXPAND VIETSOVPETRO TO DEVELOP NEW OIL AND GAS </p><p>DEPOSITS FOUND ON VIETNAM\'S CONTINENTAL SHELF.  THIS </p><p>ANNOUNCEMENT CAUSED DISCOMFORT WITH FOREIGN INVESTORS, GIVEN </p><p>THAT VIETSOVPETRO IS A STATE-STATE COMPANY AND THAT, AS OF </p><p>YET, THERE HAS BEEN NO INVITATION TO PRIVATE FIRMS TO BID ON </p><p>THE DEVELOPMENT OF THOSE DEPOSITS.  LOCAL OIL COMPANY REPS </p><p>ALSO QUESTION THE TECHNICAL EXPERTISE OF THE VIETSOVPETRO. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (SBU)  IN ADDITION, RUSSIA IS PARTICIPATING IN THE </p><p>CONSTRUCTION OF VIETNAM\'S FIRST JOINT OIL REFINERY (AT DONG </p><p>QUAT IN CENTRAL VIETNAM).  HOWEVER, THIS PROJECT IS A </p><p>POTENTIAL WHITE ELEPHANT THAT HAD BEEN REJECTED BY OTHER </p><p>FOREIGN INVESTORS, DONORS, AND THE IFIS, SINCE THE LOCATION </p><p>OF THE REFINERY IS DISTANT FROM THE SOURCE OF THE PETROLEUM, </p><p>WITH LITTLE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE (ROADS, PORTS) TO </p><p>SUPPORT THE TRANSPORT.  THIS PROJECT IS AN ADMITTED ATTEMPT </p><p>BY THE GVN TO "DISTRIBUTE DEVELOPMENT" TO THE CENTRAL REGION </p><p>AND, ACCORDING TO EXPERTS, HAS LITTLE REAL ECONOMIC </p><p>RATIONALE.  ACCORDING TO A MARCH 2001 RUSSIAN MFA </p><p>ANNOUNCEMENT, THE REFINERY, WHEN COMPLETED, WILL PRODUCE AN </p><p>ESTIMATED 6.5 MILLION TONS OF OIL A YEAR.

TOKMAKOV ALSO NOTED THAT </p><p>THERE HAS BEEN "MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL" COOPERATION IN </p><p>SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH PROJECTS, CULTURE, AND EDUCATION. </p><p>HOWEVER, HE LAMENTED THAT THESE AREAS "LAG WELL BEHIND THE </p><p>ENERGY SECTOR." </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>PUSHING TWO-WAY TRADE </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>16.  (SBU)  PRESS ARTICLES AND OFFICIAL STATEMENTS FROM THE </p><p>PUTIN AND KASYANOV VISITS DESCRIBED THE NEED TO INCREASE TWO- </p><p>WAY TRADE "UP TO ITS POTENTIAL."  PUTIN ADMITTED PUBLICLY </p><p>THAT IT WAS "ABSURD" THAT TWO-WAY TRADE WAS ONLY (AT THE </p><p>TIME OF HIS VISIT) ABOUT USD 500 MILLION A YEAR.  SIMILARLY, </p><p>KASYANOV COMMENTED DURING HIS VISIT THAT BILATERAL TRADE </p><p>"NEEDS TO GROW."  THE EUROPEAN STUDIES CENTRE\'S DR. KHOAT </p><p>OBSERVED THAT THE BILATERAL TURNOVER DURING THE SOVIET ERA </p><p>REPRESENTED OVER 60 PERCENT OF VIETNAM\'S TOTAL TRADE, BUT BY </p><p>2001 RUSSIA ACCOUNTED FOR JUST ABOUT THREE PERCENT OF </p><p>VIETNAM\'S EXPORTS AND TWO PERCENT OF ITS IMPORTS.  IN </p><p>ADDITION, VIETNAM IS RUNNING A SIGNIFICANT TRADE DEFICIT </p><p>WITH RUSSIA - RUSSIA\'S EXPORTS TO VIETNAM ARE ABOUT DOUBLE </p><p>ITS IMPORTS, ACCORDING TO PRESS REPORTS AND THE VIETNAM </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 05        HANOI  02709  03 OF 05  080504Z </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ8799 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HANOI  02709  04 OF 05  080504Z </p><p>ACTION EAP-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   A-00     CA-01    CCO-00 </p><p>      CEA-01   CG-00    CIAE-00  COME-00  CTME-00  INL-00   DINT-00 </p><p>      DOEE-00  ITCE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EXME-00 </p><p>      EUR-00   E-00     FAAE-00  FBIE-00  UTED-00  VC-00    FRB-00 </p><p>      H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   INSE-00  ITC-01   JUSE-00  LAB-01 </p><p>      L-00     VCE-00   MOFM-05  MOF-01   M-00     AC-01    NRCE-00 </p><p>      NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OCS-03   OES-00   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00 </p><p>      PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SCT-00   SP-00    SSO-00 </p><p>      SS-00    STR-00   TEST-00  TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00  USSS-00 </p><p>      SA-00    EPAE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-02   G-00 </p><p>      NFAT-00  SAS-00     /019W </p><p>                  ------------------0546C0  080505Z /38 </p><p>R 080447Z NOV 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HANOI </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 8057 </p><p>INFO AMCONSUL HO CHI MINH CITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY MOSCOW </p><p>ASEAN COLLECTIVE </p><p>USCINCPAC HONOLULU HI </p><p>SECDEF WASHDC//ISA/ACHAO// </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 04 OF 05 HANOI 002709 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV, EUR/RUS </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  02709  04 OF 05  080504Z </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>TRADE PROMOTION AGENCY. </p><p> </p><p>17.

THE </p><p>MFA\'S MINH AND TOKMAKOV OBSERVED SEPARATELY THAT THE VISIT </p><p>OF PUTIN, AND HIS "SINCERE" INTEREST IN DEVELOPING THE </p><p>BILATERAL ECONOMIC RELATIONSHIP, SERVED AS A CATALYST AND </p><p>HELPED SPUR INCREASED LINKS BETWEEN RUSSIAN AND VIETNAMESE </p><p>BUSINESSES.
