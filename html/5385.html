<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABU DHABI 000497 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARP AND NEA/RA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/28/2013 </p><p>TAGS: EAID, ETRD, ECON, PREL, TC </p><p>SUBJECT: EMBASSY ABU DHABI WELCOMES TRADE INSTITUTION-BUILDING </p><p>         IN THE UAE </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 23998 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba for reasons </p><p>1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Post concurs with NEA that a regional conference, followed </p><p>by a focused bilateral program to address the UAE\'s specific </p><p>trade-related concerns, is the best approach to trade </p><p>institution-building in the Gulf.  The regional conference should </p><p>avoid detailing specific problems of the UAE (or those of any GCC </p><p>country, for that matter, "naming and shaming" in public would be </p><p>counterproductive in our view), but rather should emphasize the </p><p>benefits of reducing barriers to trade. Such a conference might </p><p>also usefully address issues arising from the implementation of </p><p>the GCC Customs Union in terms of WTO obligations, and standards </p><p>issues. Given the UAE\'s reputation as the trading hub of the </p><p>region, it is possible that the UAEG would cover the costs of </p><p>training/travel for trade experts, host training sessions at UAEG </p><p>expense, and even propose a permanent regional training facility </p><p>in the UAE for trade-related programs. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) A long-term presence in the region of an American trade </p><p>expert would best serve our interests -- the representative could </p><p>educate the UAEG on its specific WTO obligations, as well as </p><p>explain U.S. positions in multilateral negotiations.  (Note: </p><p>The UAEG is particularly interested in our position on Trade in </p><p>Services in aluminum, petrochemicals, and textiles.  End note.) </p><p>We sense that the UAEG wants both to support the United States in </p><p>multilateral fora, as well as expand our bilateral trading </p><p>relationship, but does not understand its own commitments, the </p><p>technical aspects of WTO Agreements, or the intricacies of our </p><p>domestic requirements fully. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) We should aim to lash up with the WTO\'s International </p><p>Trade Center (ITC) and the Arab Monetary Fund -- headquartered </p><p>in Abu Dhabi -- to build upon those organizations\' existing </p><p>programs for trade institution- building.  The AMF, in particular, </p><p>manages an active training schedule throughout the year, </p><p>but does not have indigenous expertise.  The AMF signed an </p><p>agreement with the WTO\'s ITC in 2001 to provide trade-related </p><p>training and the necessary experts from Geneva to conduct the </p><p>training.  The seminars in 2002 were well attended by all 21 </p><p>countries of the AMF\'s membership. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) UAE officials have welcomed targeted WTO training </p><p>-- especially in Trade in Services and TRIPs -- and raised the </p><p>issue at the U.S.-UAE Strategic Dialogue in Washington in November. </p><p> Post believes that the UAE could also benefit from training </p><p>in Government Procurement and Intellectual Property Rights, </p><p>specifically.  A better understanding of agreements related to </p><p>Customs Valuation Methods, Rules of Origin, and Standards as </p><p>Non-Tariff Barriers to Trade are also critical to the UAE, but are </p><p>ideal for regional training fora given the realization of the GCC </p><p>Customs Union on January 1. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) We note that the WTO also provides non-trade related </p><p>training consistent with our other MEPI goals -- fostering workers\' </p><p>rights and protection, supporting workforce skills development, and </p><p>revamping/updating of the local commercial and agency laws and </p><p>courts -- which may also be applicable in the UAE. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
