<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 004538 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/29/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PGOV, PINR, SOCI, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: HUMAN RIGHTS PROGRESS:  GOJ CREATES TWO NEW HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS BODIES </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: PolCouns Doug Silliman for reasons 1.5 (B)(D) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  Over the past few months, the GOJ has created two </p><p>new governmental human rights organizations -- the National </p><p>Center for Human Rights and a Directorate of Human Rights in </p><p>the Foreign Ministry.  While the work of these new </p><p>institutions has ramped up too slowly for local activists, </p><p>their creation is a positive step that will create human </p><p>rights stakeholders within the GOJ.  Both organizations have </p><p>approached the Embassy about the possibility of USG funding </p><p>for training their employees.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>NEW NATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS CENTER </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  The Government of Jordan (GOJ) established a </p><p>National Center for Human Rights (the Center) through a </p><p>temporary law which came into effect on December 23, 2002. </p><p>The law lays out the basic structure, objectives, rights, and </p><p>responsibilities of the Center, constituted as an independent </p><p>governmental body.  In February 2003, the GOJ named a 13 </p><p>member Board of Trustees with Ahmad Obeidat as chairman, and </p><p>the Board named Dr. Walid Saadi Commissioner General for </p><p>Human Rights and director of the Center at its first meeting </p><p>on March 30.  The Center has since taken up residence in a </p><p>former government guest house in Amman and staff members have </p><p>begun their work. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  The Center has educational, protective, and </p><p>correctional responsibilities.  These include recording and </p><p>monitoring alleged abuses reported to the Center, preparing </p><p>an annual report, liaising with national and international </p><p>bodies, and proposing human rights policies to the </p><p>government.  It will also train personnel from across the </p><p>government on HR issues.  Under the law, the Center,s </p><p>financing will come from a number of sources, among them an </p><p>annual subsidy from the GOJ, grants from sources acceptable </p><p>to the Cabinet, and religious endowments (awqaf). </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>ACTIVISTS CRITICIZE SLOW START </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Two key Embassy human rights contacts outside the </p><p>Center feel that progress on getting the Center established </p><p>and operating has been slow.  One pointed out that this is in </p><p>line with the national sentiment for consensus and slow </p><p>change.  Both agreed that the choice of Obeidat as Board </p><p>chairman sends the wrong signal to the average Jordanian, </p><p>i.e. that there is a strong link between the status quo, </p><p>particularly the security services, and the Center.  While </p><p>there may be bureaucratic advantages to the choice of </p><p>chairman, they feel these advantages will be outweighed by </p><p>his background in intelligence and government.  At the same </p><p>time, they readily agreed that establishment of the Center is </p><p>a sign of progress and they are anxious to work with it. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>NEW MFA HUMAN RIGHTS DIRECTORATE </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  On March 5, 2003, FM Marwan Muasher ordered the </p><p>creation of a Human Rights Directorate within the MFA. </p><p>Currently staffed with five diplomats, it is divided into </p><p>four sections responsible for (1) international HR </p><p>agreements, (2) international organizations and responses to </p><p>foreign governments, HR reports, (3) regional HR </p><p>organizations and NGOs, and (4) &human security8 and </p><p>international &human law.8  In addition to these foci, it </p><p>is also tasked with examining Jordanian legislation in order </p><p>to facilitate harmonization with international agreements the </p><p>GOJ has ratified, and participating in GOJ committees which </p><p>implement these agreements, i.e. it will also have a key </p><p>internal focus.  Bisher Khasawneh, the head of the new </p><p>Directorate, hopes it will improve Jordanian interaction with </p><p>NGOs and IOs and enhance GOJ public relations in reaction to </p><p>HR reports.  He has approached the USG to help train new MFA </p><p>HR officers in international human rights law and interacting </p><p>with HR NGOs. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  The creation of these two organizations is a good </p><p>start in creating human rights stakeholders within the GOJ, </p><p>something that has long been missing.  Post hopes to sustain </p><p>momentum with the GOJ on HR issues, including through the </p><p>recently announced DRL Human Rights and Democratization Fund </p><p>training grant, which should benefit both organizations.  End </p><p>comment. </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>BIO NOTES </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  The new Chairman, Ahmed Obeidat, is a former Prime </p><p>Minister and head of the General Intelligence Directorate, </p><p>and led the temporary human rights commission that the King </p><p>appointed in 200 to make recommendations on human rights </p><p>policy.  He is well-connected politically and has a </p><p>reputation for being independent in his thinking and actions, </p><p>as well as socially progressive.  Human rights activists have </p><p>told us that he has used his connections to intervene in </p><p>individual human rights cases that have come to his </p><p>attention.  At the same time, those same contacts criticized </p><p>Obeidat for using personal connections to intervene, rather </p><p>than working to change the system and make institutions and </p><p>individuals more accountable.  He has a record of strong </p><p>cooperation with the Embassy Public Affairs Section. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  Walid as-Saadi, the new Commissioner, did his </p><p>undergraduate studies at Southern Methodist University and </p><p>went to law school at the University of Chicago. He is a </p><p>retired diplomat with previous HR experience at the UN. The </p><p>staff members at the Center are largely young lawyers, IT </p><p>workers, and university graduates brought in from outside </p><p>government. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  Bisher Khasawneh, head of the MFA\'s HR Directorate, </p><p>also has responsibilities as Director of the MFA\'s public </p><p>Communications Department (i.e. press relations).  Khasawneh </p><p>is a lawyer by training, and has been assigned to work at in </p><p>the Jordanian Mission to the UN starting in the Spring of </p><p>2004. </p><p>HALE </p><p></p></div>
