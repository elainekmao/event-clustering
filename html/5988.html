BEGIN </p><p>LETTER: </p><p> </p><p>THE HONORABLE KENZO OSHIMA, U/SYG, UN OFFICE FOR THE </p><p>COORDINATION OF HUMANITARIAN AFFAIRS (OCHA) </p><p>MARK MALLOCH BROWN, UNDP ADMINISTRATOR </p><p>CAROL BELLAMY, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, UNICEF </p><p>UNITED NATIONS HEADQUARTERS </p><p>NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK 10017-3505 </p><p> </p><p>DEAR UN COLLEAGUES, </p><p> </p><p>     I HAVE JUST RETURNED FROM A TRIP TO ETHIOPIA (FEBRUARY </p><p>15-21), A COUNTRY I VISITED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 1984 </p><p>DURING A DEVASTATING FAMINE THAT ULTIMATELY SAW OVER ONE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  00832  01 OF 02  271638Z </p><p>MILLION PEOPLE DIE OF STARVATION AND RELATED CAUSES. I HAD </p><p>THE GOOD FORTUNE THIS TIME TO BE ACCOMPANIED BY USAID </p><p>ASSISTANT ADMINISTRATOR ROGER WINTER (WHO FOR MANY YEARS </p><p>ABLY MANAGED THE U.S. COMMITTEE FOR REFUGEES), AND WE WERE </p><p>ABLE TO VISIT A NUMBER OF RURAL SITES IN EAST SHEWA, OMOMIYA </p><p>AND SOUTHERN NATIONS (SNNPR). </p><p> </p><p>     AS PER THE U.S. CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL (CDC) </p><p>(PRESENTLY ASSESSING THE NUTRITIONAL AND CONTAGIOUS DISEASE </p><p>STATUS IN FOUR ETHIOPIAN GEOGRAPHIC ZONES), THEY ESTIMATE </p><p>(FEBRUARY-JUNE 2003) 32,000 EXCESS DEATHS DUE TO DROUGHT </p><p>WILL OCCUR IN THE REVIEWED AREAS. IF THIS TREND IS PROJECTED </p><p>NATIONALLY, UNLESS VIGOROUS ACTION IS TAKEN NOW WITH THE UN </p><p>AGENCIES IN A LEADING ROLE, EXCESS DEATHS COULD REACH AS </p><p>HIGH AS 300,000 TO 500,000 PEOPLE BY THE END OF 2003. </p><p> </p><p>     I MUST BRING TO YOUR ATTENTION THAT WE REPEATEDLY HEARD </p><p>THAT IN THIS CRISIS, EXCEPTING WFP, THE REST OF THE UN </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS IN ETHIOPIA "DO NOT HAVE A SENSE OF THE DEPTH </p><p>OF THE EMERGENCY AND ARE NOT DOING ENOUGH." THE TRUTH IS </p><p>POSSIBLY THAT IN ETHIOPIA THE UN AGENCIES ARE GEARED FAR </p><p>MORE TOWARD DEVELOPMENT THAN EMERGENCY RESPONSE. GIVEN THE </p><p>WIDESPREAD DETERIORATION IN THE HUMANITARIAN SITUATION, </p><p>HOWEVER, THIS NEEDS TO BE ADJUSTED. </p><p> </p><p>     SPECIFICALLY, I WOULD ASK YOU TO SERIOUSLY CONSIDER: </p><p> </p><p>- NAMING A RESIDENT HUMANITARIAN COORDINATOR TO FOCUS ON </p><p>IMPROVING THE EFFICIENCY AND OVERALL EFFECTIVENESS OF UN </p><p>OPERATIONS IN RESPONDING TO THE PRESENT CRISIS IN BOTH </p><p>ETHIOPIA AND ERITREA; </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  00832  01 OF 02  271638Z </p><p> </p><p>- PRIORITIZING ASSISTANCE TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A </p><p>NATIONWIDE NUTRITION SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM. WE ARE SIMPLY NOT </p><p>GETTING THE "WARNING" DATA WE NEED TO RESPOND AS REQUIRED; </p><p> </p><p>- THE UN (AND THEIR PARTNER NGOS) SHOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF </p><p>FOOD DELIVERIES (WHERE LARGE NUMBERS OF BENEFICIARIES OFTEN </p><p>WAIT FOR HOURS TO RECEIVE THEIR RATION) TO IMPART MOTHER- </p><p>CHILD CARE HEALTH TRAINING AND NUTRITION EDUCATION MESSAGES. </p><p>IN PARTICULAR, FEEDING SITES SHOULD SERVE AS FOCAL POINTS </p><p>FOR IMMUNIZATIONS AGAINST MEASLES AND OTHER CONTAGIOUS </p><p>DISEASES SUCH AS TYPHUS, RELAPSING FEVER, MENINGITIS. </p><p> </p><p>     IN MY MANY YEARS IN CONGRESS, I FULLY ENDORSED </p><p>APPROPRIATIONS FOR UN AGENCIES AND AM HONORED TO BE </p><p>REPRESENTING MY COUNTRY TO THE UN AGENCIES ON FOOD AND </p><p>AGRICULTURE HERE IN ROME. FOR ME, ETHIOPIA IS UNIQUE AMONG </p><p>AFRICAN COUNTRIES FOR HAVING NEVER BEEN COLONIZED. IT IS </p><p>TRULY BLESSED WITH A RICH CULTURE, HISTORY AND TRADITIONAL </p><p>KNOWLEDGE. BUT THIS PRESENT CRISIS, UNLESS DEFTLY HANDLED, </p><p>COULD SETBACK YEARS OF DEVELOPMENT GAINS. WE ALL NEED TO </p><p>INTENSIFY OUR EFFORTS. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ5097 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  00832  02 OF 02  271638Z </p><p>ACTION AID-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AF-00    AGRE-00  CIAE-00  USNW-00  DODE-00 </p><p>      SRPP-00  EB-00    EUR-00   UTED-00  VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00 </p><p>      IO-00    VCE-00   NEA-00   NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OES-00   OIC-02 </p><p>      PER-00   TEST-00  SA-00    PRM-00   SAS-00     /002W </p><p>                  ------------------3C79B1  271639Z /38 </p><p>P 271545Z FEB 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO USMISSION USUN NEW YORK PRIORITY </p><p>SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 8499 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY ADDIS ABABA </p><p>AMEMBASSY ASMARA </p><p>EU MEMBER STATES COLLECTIVE </p><p>IGAD COLLECTIVE </p><p>USEU BRUSSELS 3151 </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 02 ROME 000832 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>AIDAC </p><p> </p><p>FROM U.S. MISSION IN ROME </p><p> </p><p>USUN NEW YORK FOR AMBASSADOR NEGROPONTE AND CSERWER </p><p>USAID/W FOR ADMINISTRATOR NATSIOS, D/A SCHIECK, AA/DCHA </p><p>WINTER, AA/AFR NEWMAN AND DAA/AFR BROWN, DCHA/D/FFP LANDIS, </p><p>D/OFDA MCCONNELL, AA/GLOBAL PETERSON </p><p>STATE FOR IO A/S HOLMES, A/S PRM DEWEY, A/S AFR KANSTEINER, </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  00832  02 OF 02  271638Z </p><p>AFR/EA, IO/EDA WINNICK </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA FOR AMBASSADOR MOLRY AND USAID/KYLOH </p><p>BRUSSELS FOR AFRICA WATCHERS AND USAID/LERNER </p><p>NSC FOR JDWORKEN AND AFRICA DIRECTORATE </p><p> </p><p>E.O.  12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS:     EAID, AORC, WFP, UN, PREF, EAGR, EU </p><p>SUBJECT:  LETTER TO U/SYG KENZO OSHIMA, UNDP ADMINISTRATOR </p><p>MALLOCH BROWN AND UNICEF EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CAROL BELLAMY </p><p>FROM AMBASSADOR TONY P.
