<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001824 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PD (DALTON), AF/S (SCHLACHTER), INR/R/MR </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REPORT GOZ TO CLAMP DOWN ON OPPOSITION; </p><p>HARARE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under headline "Signs of the end" the independent </p><p>      weekly "The Financial Gazette" dedicated its </p><p>      August 8 editorial to criticizing the government of </p><p>      Zimbabwe for mooting a plan to clamp down on </p><p>      opposition by withdrawing traveling documents from </p><p>      Zimbabweans opposed to the Mugabe administration. </p><p>      Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   "The threat by Home Affairs Minister John Nkomo to </p><p>      withdraw the passport of Zimbabweans who are opposed to the </p><p>      government and to slap them with exit visas is only the </p><p>      latest sign, if any was needed, of a regime gone berserk </p><p>      and clearly nearing its end.  Not content with draconian </p><p>      laws rushed through Parliament earlier this year to silence </p><p>      democratic dissent, the besieged government now wants to </p><p>      clamp down further on the free movement and free speech of </p><p>      some citizens on the pretext that they are campaigning </p><p>      against Zimbabwe.  That there is a world of difference </p><p>      between Zimbabwe, as a nation and as a state, and </p><p>      individual government members who are willfully flouting </p><p>      the law is conveniently ignored to try to appeal to the </p><p>      crude emotions of the common man.  Needless to say that the </p><p>      proposed measures are grossly unconstitutional and aimed at </p><p>      pushing Zimbabwe back into the Stone Age. . .It is thus </p><p>      that the administration\'s counter-sanctions lobby has </p><p>      hatched the grand plan of taking harsh retaliatory action </p><p>      against all perceived enemies, both domestic and foreign, </p><p>      to try to weaken a people\'s resolve to end tyranny that is </p><p>      daily engulfing the land. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>WHITEHEAD </p><p></p></div>
