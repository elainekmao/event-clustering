(U) Summary.   Under Secretary of Treasury John Taylor </p><p>and Under Secretary of Commerce Grant Aldonas met with a </p><p>group of Palestinian business leaders on the margins of the </p><p>World Economic Forum on June 21, 2003 (attendees list at </p><p>end of cable).  The business leaders discussed their </p><p>skepticism about the current roadmap, severe restrictions </p><p>on their ability to conduct normal business due to </p><p>purported security concerns, their desire to be involved in </p><p>Iraq reconstruction efforts, and the need for long-term </p><p>technical assistance. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) Where is the Economic Roadmap? </p><p>The business delegation said they lacked confidence in the </p><p>roadmap because, they said, it omitted economic concerns </p><p>and the prospects of political benefits seemed distant. </p><p>They nevertheless expressed support for the new Palestinian </p><p>government, but said they needed tangible measures to </p><p>ensure greater economic freedom before they could have </p><p>faith in the process.   The business leaders expressed </p><p>frustration with the perceived increase in the number of </p><p>checkpoints since the announcement of the roadmap.  They </p><p>produced a map illustrating the numerous checkpoints in the </p><p>West Bank and Gaza, and explained how these checkpoints </p><p>severely restrict their movements and their ability to </p><p>conduct business, crippling the Palestinian economy. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) Security to Protect Markets </p><p>The business leaders detailed examples of how they believe </p><p>the Israeli government uses security as a protectionist </p><p>commercial measure to restrict free markets.  One example </p><p>involved the controlled entry of businessmen and blocking </p><p>transit of goods into the Gaza Industrial Zone.   They </p><p>requested assistance to designate the Gaza Industrial Zone </p><p>as a special area insulated from security restrictions. </p><p>The group also highlighted the withholding of </p><p>communications equipment from Palestinian Cellular </p><p>Communications Co. for approximately 20 months by Israeli </p><p>customs agents.   The businessmen had doubts as to the </p><p>legitimacy of the security arguments and instead believed </p><p>the equipment was seized to give the Israeli telecom </p><p>companies a commercial advantage. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) Piece of the Iraq Reconstruction Pie </p><p>The group worried that they were being sidelined from </p><p>current reconstruction efforts in Iraq and showed a strong </p><p>desire to be involved.  They also noted that that their </p><p>participation would be limited because of the restriction </p><p>of their movements within the region.  They also felt that </p><p>their export promotion efforts were underdeveloped and </p><p>hampered by the closures. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) Technical Assistance Needed </p><p>Mr. Tareq Abbas, son of Prime Minister Abbas, noted that </p><p>they needed long-term technical assistance for building the </p><p>Palestinian state.  Although they did not specify the areas </p><p>in which they would benefit from technical assistance, they </p><p>stated that they needed long-term support and assistance </p><p>with implementation in a variety of areas.  He noted that </p><p>USAID studies without follow up technical support were not </p><p>as helpful. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) Attendees </p><p>Undersecretaries Aldonas and Taylor met with: Mr. Sabih </p><p>Masri, Chairman of Palestine Telecommunications Company; </p><p>Mr. Zahi Khoury, Chairman National Beverage Company; Mr. </p><p>Samer Khoury, CEO Consolidated Contractors Co.; Mr. Nassar </p><p>Nassar, Chairman Palestinian Trade Center; Mr. Abdul Malek </p><p>Jaber, Managing Director Palestine Industrial Estates </p><p>Development and Investment Co.; Mr. Mosab Khorma, CEO </p><p>Palestinian Telecommunications Co.; Mr. Hakam Kanafani, CEO </p><p>Palestinian Cellular Communications; Mr. Tareq Abbas, </p><p>Managing Director Sky Advertising; and Mr. Kamel Husseini, </p><p>Managing Director Ellam Tam PR. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
