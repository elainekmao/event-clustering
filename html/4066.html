<p>UNCLAS AMMAN 006205 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>IIP/G/NEA (BDURANT); NEA/PPD (DMACINNES, CBOURGEOIS, </p><p>JGAFFNEY); NEA/ARN (SZIADEH) </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: OIIP,  OEXC,  SCUL,  JO </p><p>SUBJECT: DVC Program on "The Negative Effect of Piracy on </p><p>Computer Software, Audio Cassettes and Video Cassettes.": </p><p>Program Evaluation </p><p> </p><p>1.   Summary: In cooperation with the National </p><p>Center for Intellectual Property (NCIP) and the ECON </p><p>Section, PAS Amman conducted the fourth and final DVC </p><p>program of a series on IPR on Wednesday, September 4 at 1400 </p><p>GMT.  The Audience consisted of about sixty lawyers, </p><p>businessmen, IT specialists, government officials and </p><p>academicians who displayed great interest in the topic at </p><p>hand. </p><p> </p><p>2.   The 75 minute session took place in the Public Affair\'s </p><p>Auditorium. </p><p> </p><p>3.   Date: September 4, 2002; Fourth Quarter FY-2002 </p><p> </p><p>4. The DVC program focused on the legality of producing </p><p>computer software and audio cassettes as well as the laws </p><p>enforced in protecting these goods.  Ms. Kiefer used a power </p><p>point slide show when elaborating on the subject and </p><p>discussed the importance of preventing unauthorized users </p><p>from making use of copyrighted materials.  Mr. Christopher </p><p>Merriam who made a surprise appearance and participated in </p><p>the program also discussed the importance of protecting </p><p>material and he stipulated "IPR protects industries from </p><p>being damaged by Piracy" and that it also promotes the </p><p>growth of these industries. </p><p> </p><p>5. MPP Goal: This program supported the MPP goals on </p><p>economic reform and promoting understanding and appreciation </p><p>of U.S society and values. </p><p> </p><p>6. The Jordanian audience was enthusiastic and attendance </p><p>for the program was very good.  Many of their topics of </p><p>concern were addressed, however the power point slideshow </p><p>was too lengthy and interactive dialogue would have been the </p><p>audience\'s preference. </p><p> </p><p>7. Three ISDN lines were used to make the connection.  These </p><p>ISDN lines yielded a very good picture, resolution and </p><p>sound.  The connection was obstructed once but we were </p><p>reconnected instantly. </p><p> </p><p>8. Quality of Support: Very Good.  PAS Amman appreciates the </p><p>support of IIP/G/NEA and NEA/PPD.  Many thanks go to Ms. </p><p>Inga McMichael for her support.  We look forward to </p><p>continued cooperation on future programs.  GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
