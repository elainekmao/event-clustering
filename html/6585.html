<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 001699 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/20/2013 </p><p>TAGS: AEMR, AMGT, ASEC, CASC, CVIS, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: TF1ZO1: AMMAN SITREP 2 (3/20 1530 LOCAL) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edward W. Gnehm.  Reasons 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>General Overview </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) As of 1530 local (1330 GMT), the situation throughout </p><p>Jordan is calm, and street traffic and activity is lower than </p><p>normal.  Several peaceful demonstrations are ongoing and </p><p>others are planned for later today, however there have been </p><p>no reports of any disturbances.  Amman\'s Queen Alia </p><p>International Airport remains open. While non-regional air </p><p>carriers have suspended service, and Royal Jordanian </p><p>Airline\'s 3/20 and 3/21 flights to Baghdad have been </p><p>canceled, other commercial services are continuing.  RJ\'s </p><p>3/20 flight to Chicago via Shannon, Ireland is still </p><p>scheduled to depart as usual.  As of early morning, oil tank </p><p>trucks were still entering Jordan from Iraq, but the </p><p>Jordanian Oil and Finance Ministries did not expect this to </p><p>continue for long.  Press reports described traffic along the </p><p>Amman-Baghdad highway on the Jordan side of the border as </p><p>very light. At mid-day, the Amman Stock Market was up 2.5 </p><p>percent, with Embassy business contacts expressing relief </p><p>that a period of uncertainty had come to an end.  No </p><p>shortages of goods have been reported, although sales of some </p><p>specialty items (baby food, imported goods, and medicine) are </p><p>heavier than usual. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>Consular Issues </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  The Consular section had received about 50 calls by </p><p>mid-day from American citizens, most of whom were confused </p><p>about whether the USG had ordered them to depart Jordan.  The </p><p>Embassy has disseminated three cleared warden messages (the </p><p>onset of hostilities, the worldwide caution, and the travel </p><p>warning for the Middle East and north Africa) to the American </p><p>community to clarify the situation.  The Embassy is prepared </p><p>to send ConOffs to Ruweished transit camps and/or the </p><p>Jordanian-Iraqi border to identify and assist Amcits, if </p><p>necessary.  No Amcit crossings from Iraq into Jordan have </p><p>been reported thus far. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>GOJ Actions/Statements </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Foreign Minister Muasher was interviewed on CNN at </p><p>approximately 1030 local time.  His main points were that </p><p>Jordan is not participating in the military operation and </p><p>will not be used as a launchpad for attacks on Iraq, that it </p><p>will rely on the "good offices" of the U.S. and UN to rebuild </p><p>Iraq, that there must be a renewed focus on resolving the </p><p>Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and that a limited number of </p><p>U.S. troops are in Jordan operating Patriot missile </p><p>batteries, training Jordanians and conducting relief </p><p>operations. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>Security </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The Public Security Directorate (PSD) has provided </p><p>additional support to the Embassy, as pre-arranged, and we </p><p>remain in close consultation with all GOJ security agencies </p><p>and are monitoring developments.  PSD reports that small </p><p>peaceful demonstrations (100-200 people) occurred this </p><p>morning at the Baqa\'a and Wihdat Palestinian refugee camps, </p><p>and that the Lawyers\' Professional Association has organized </p><p>a small (250 person) government-approved march from the main </p><p>courthouse in Amman to the city center.  Additionally, </p><p>students are planning mid-day demonstrations at three </p><p>universities (the Arab College, Zarqa University and </p><p>Al-Hashimiya University).  PSD expects these gatherings to be </p><p>peaceful and confined to university grounds, but will have </p><p>additional security personnel on hand to ensure order. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>Refugee/Humanitarian Issues </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) As of 1200 local time, the only population movement </p><p>toward the Jordanian border has been 200 third-country </p><p>nationals (TCNs) -- mostly Sudanese citizens.  No Iraqi </p><p>asylum seekers have yet approached the Jordanian border. </p><p>According to IOM country director Georgette Hoshe, 12 TCNs </p><p>have been denied entry by the GOJ.  The group of 12 includes </p><p>some Sudanese diplomatic passport holders, Sudanese traveling </p><p>on expired Sudanese passports, and one Sudanese national from </p><p>southern Sudan who wants to seek asylum in Jordan.  The GOJ </p><p>will not allow the Sudanese to enter Jordan until someone </p><p>from the Sudanese Embassy comes to the border to screen the </p><p>Sudanese nationals.  IOM has thus far been unable to locate </p><p>anyone from the Sudanese Embassy and, along with UNHCR, is </p><p>providing tents, water and food for this group. </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) The remaining 188 TCNs have been moved to the </p><p>IOM/Jordanian Red Crescent Society (JRCS) transit camp in </p><p>Ruweished.  IOM is arranging meals and transportation for </p><p>these individuals.  Poor weather conditions -- high winds and </p><p>blowing sand -- continue to make it difficult for UNHCR and </p><p>JRCS to erect tents.  That said, UNHCR had erected 30 tents </p><p>at the refugee camp and JCRS had set up 200 tents at the </p><p>transit camp at last report, sufficient to deal with current </p><p>numbers.  UNHCR says it will be able to set up additional </p><p>tents according to demand. </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>Press </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) All major Jordanian dailies ran 24-hour operations </p><p>in anticipation of war and thus covered the cruise missile </p><p>attacks (described as efforts to assassinate Saddam), plus </p><p>President Bush\'s statement on the outbreak of hostilities. </p><p>Editorials, undoubtedly written before the beginning of </p><p>hostilities, predict that while U.S. military victory may be </p><p>inevitable, the real test will be how America deals with the </p><p>consequences, particularly the "mosaic" of potentially </p><p>hostile ethnic groups in Iraq.  Liberal daily Ad-Dustour\'s </p><p>columnist Batten Ali Warden held both "the Washington gang" </p><p>and the Iraqi regime responsible for the war -- the Iraqis </p><p>because of their long history of mistakes.  Semi-official </p><p>Ar-Rai\'s columnist and Health Minister Abdul Rahim Melhas </p><p>stated that while Arab regimes might have their reasons for </p><p>standing by the U.S., America was losing the battle of hearts </p><p>and minds, and he referred to the Arab "culture of martyrdom" </p><p>and penchant for last stands.  Finally, papers reported that </p><p>yesterday the French Embassy was being showered with bouquets </p><p>from appreciative Jordanians. </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
