<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 001624 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EUR/SE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/13/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, TU, OSCE </p><p>SUBJECT: GOT CLOSES PRO-KURDISH HADEP PARTY, OPENS CASE </p><p>AGAINST SUCCESSOR </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A.

(C) Summary: Turkey\'s highest court announced the closure </p><p>of the pro-Kurdish HADEP party the same day a chief </p><p>prosecutor opened a case to close the closely linked DEHAP </p><p>party.  HADEP is accused of aiding the PKK and other </p><p>offenses; DEHAP is charged with actions against the </p><p>democratic state and legal institutions.  HADEP leaders and </p><p>other Embassy contacts say the actions, timed for maximum </p><p>impact, are part of a broader anti-Kurdish crackdown.  The </p><p>court closed HADEP despite recent reforms designed to raise </p><p>the standard for such actions.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>HADEP Closed, Successor Accused </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) The Constitutional Court March 13 announced its </p><p>decision to close the pro-Kurdish People\'s Democracy Party </p><p>(HADEP) on charges of supporting the terrorist Kurdistan </p><p>Workers Party (PKK aka KADEK) and committing separatist acts. </p><p> The Court banned 46 HADEP members from participating in </p><p>political activity for five years.  Court Chairman Mustafa </p><p>Bumin told reporters the case, filed in 1999, included </p><p>evidence that HADEP had provided (unspecified) aid and </p><p>assistance to the PKK.  "We are talking about an act of </p><p>terrorism; we are not only talking about some statements," he </p><p>told reporters.  The party was closed under Articles 68 and </p><p>69 of the Constitution, which prohibit parties from </p><p>undermining the independence or unity of the State and allow </p><p>for the closure of parties found in violation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Almost simultaneously, Supreme Court of Appeals Chief </p><p>Prosecutor Sabih Kanadoglu filed a case with the </p><p>Constitutional Court seeking the closure of the Democracy </p><p>People\'s Party (DEHAP), which is closely linked to HADEP. </p><p>Kanadoglu charged DEHAP with acts "contrary to the principles </p><p>of a democratic republic" and with causing "loss of </p><p>confidence in legal institutions."  (Note: HADEP created </p><p>DEHAP before the November elections as insurance against a </p><p>possible pre-election closure of HADEP; several former HADEP </p><p>leaders ran in the elections under the DEHAP banner.  In the </p><p>past, the GOT closed two of HADEP\'s predecessor parties.  End </p><p>note.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Ahmet Turan Demir, HADEP chairman, told Emboff the </p><p>actions against HADEP and DEHAP constituted a politically </p><p>motivated effort to crush pro-Kurdish expression and </p><p>undermine democracy.  Demir said the most damaging element is </p><p>the banning of 46 HADEP leaders, a severe measure that will </p><p>have a chilling effect across the political spectrum.  "This </p><p>is a dangerous situation.  It will lead to the isolation of </p><p>Turkey from the world," he said.  Demir said HADEP will </p><p>appeal to the European Court of Human Rights. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>"Anti Kurdish, Anti-Democratic" Crackdown </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Contacts espousing widely divergent political </p><p>philosophies expressed to us their concern about growing </p><p>anti-Kurdish sentiments, among both the Turkish State and </p><p>elements of the public, as a possible Iraq war looms. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Baskin Oran, a noted scholar at Ankara University\'s </p><p>prestigious Political Science Faculty and a specialist in </p><p>minority issues, characterized to us the actions against </p><p>HADEP/DEHAP as "horrifying, disastrous."  Oran drew attention </p><p>to what he called the suspicious timing of the legal actions, </p><p>which come amid widespread Kurdish fears of a GOT crackdown </p><p>in the Kurdish southeast in the event of war in Iraq (Reftels </p><p>A-E).  Elements of "the State," opposed to human rights </p><p>reform and EU membership, deliberately timed the HADEP </p><p>decision and the DEHAP case for maximum impact, he said. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Two senior Kurdish politicians -- one Kurmanji- and one </p><p>Zaza-speaker -- in the Islamist Saadet Party called our </p><p>attention to a palpable rise in Turkish-Kurdish tensions. </p><p>Both affiliated with the Naksibendi tarikat, they expressed </p><p>concern that the Turkish State\'s zeal in repressing dissent </p><p>in the Kurdish southeast will lead to a regional </p><p>"anti-democratic" crackdown -- asserting that, even in </p><p>Ankara, far from the fighting, Kurds will be "afraid to leave </p><p>their homes" if the bombing starts.  On March 12, Saadet </p><p>kingmaker Oguzhan Asilturk told D/Polcouns that the Turkish </p><p>State\'s "racist" attitude toward the Kurds is deeply rooted </p><p>in the Kemalist State and has been an enduring </p><p>socio-political reality since Ataturk\'s day. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- The human rights organization Mazlum Der, which focuses on </p><p>both Islamic and Kurdish issues, released a statement </p><p>decrying the decisions as: 1) an abandonment of democratic </p><p>principals and a violation of the Constitution; and 2) a blow </p><p>to Turkey\'s EU bid. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>Recent Reforms Failed to Protect HADEP </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) Recent GOT reforms were designed to make it more </p><p>difficult to close political parties.  Parliament in January </p><p>adopted legislation requiring a three-fifths majority of the </p><p>11-member Constitutional Court, rather than a simple </p><p>majority, to close a party.  The legislation also stipulated </p><p>that parties could be closed only for reasons stated in the </p><p>Constitution; previously, closures could also be based on the </p><p>more broadly worded reasons cited in the Political Parties </p><p>Law (Reftel F).  The ruling AK Party, itself facing a closure </p><p>case, strongly backed the legislation.  In March, Parliament </p><p>passed legislation giving the Constitutional Court the option </p><p>of depriving a party of state funds rather than ordering </p><p>closure.  Bumin in September spoke out against a Supreme </p><p>Election Board decision to ban two HADEP leaders and other </p><p>prominent candidates from the November elections, publicly </p><p>arguing that the decision would harm Turkey\'s relations with </p><p>the EU.  But Bumin on March 13 said HADEP\'s support for the </p><p>PKK required the maximum sanction. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) The timing of this crackdown on Kurdish political </p><p>expression is no coincidence.  As recently as December, we </p><p>were told the HADEP closure case could not be completed until </p><p>verdicts were issued in a number of other HADEP cases, a </p><p>process that could "normally" be expected to take a couple of </p><p>years or more to run its course.  It is common practice for </p><p>courts to hold the possibility of an adverse ruling as a </p><p>sword of Damocles over an organization deemed suspicious -- </p><p>the ongoing cases against AK\'s Prime Minister-Designate </p><p>Erdogan are an example. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
