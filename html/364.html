<p>S E C R E T  STATE 182269 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL:  OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PTER, IR, LI, UK, SU, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT:  REPORT THAT ABU NIDAL IS IN IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>1. (S) FOLLOWING FOR POSTS\' INFORMATION IS AN </p><p>UNCONFIRMED REPORT THAT ABU NIDAL IS PRESENTLY IN </p><p>BAGHDAD AND OTHER INFORMATION ON THE ABU NIDAL </p><p>ORGANIZATION (ANO) PROVIDED BY A FRENCH </p><p>COUNTER-TERRORISM EXPERT.  THE INFORMATION THAT ABU </p><p>NIDAL IS CURRENTLY IN BAGHDAD IS AT SHARP VARIANCE WITH </p><p>INFORMATION PROVIDED RECENTLY BY THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT </p><p>AND AVAILABLE TO US FROM OTHER SOURCES DEEMED RELIABLE. </p><p>THE INFORMATION TRACKS CLOSELY WITH PLO-GENERATED RUMORS </p><p>CIRCULATING IN BAGHDAD IN LATE MAY.  THESE RUMORS </p><p>ASSERTED THAT ABU NIDAL HAD BEEN REFUSED ENTRY INTO IRAQ. </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) HOWEVER, GIVEN HIGH PRIORITY USG ATTACHES TO </p><p>PUTTING ABU NIDAL OUT OF BUSINESS AND GOOD PAST </p><p>INFORMATION FROM THIS SOURCE, WE WANTED TO SHARE HIS </p><p>INFORMATION AND ASSESSMENT OF THE ANO.  RECENT ATTACKS </p><p>AGAINST ANO DISSIDENTS IN ALGERIA AND SYRIA SUGGEST THAT </p><p>THE ANO MAY BE TRYING TO RE-ESTABLISH ITS TERRORIST </p><p>CREDENTIALS AND PLANNING OTHER ATTACKS.  DEPARTMENT IS </p><p>PARTICULARLY EAGER TO KEEP THE ANO ISOLATED AND OFF </p><p>BALANCE.  DEPARTMENT WANTS TO MAINTAIN OR INCREASE </p><p>EXISTING PRESSURE ON LIBYA AND ANY OTHER POTENTIAL STATE </p><p>SPONSORS TO DISTANCE THEMSELVES CLEARLY FROM THIS </p><p>TERRORIST GROUP.  POSTS ARE REQUESTED TO KEEP ANO ON </p><p>TERRORISM AGENDA WITH HOST GOVERNMENTS, STRESSING ITS </p><p>BLOODY TERRORIST RECORD AND THE NEED FOR ALL STATES TO </p><p>WORK TOGETHER TO PUT THE ANO OUT OF BUSINESS AND TO KEEP </p><p>ITS MEMBERS ON THE RUN.  LONDON AND KHARTOUM SEE ACTION </p><p>REQUEST PARA 8. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) SOURCE IS A PRIVATE FRENCH COUNTER-TERRORISM </p><p>EXPERT WHO HAS EXCELLENT CONTACTS WITH EUROPEAN </p><p>INTELLIGENCE SERVICES AND MIDDLE EASTERN GROUPS.  IN </p><p>MARCH, EXPERT REPORTED CONTACTS BETWEEN THE ABU NIDAL </p><p>ORGANIZATION (ANO) AND IRAQ TO DISCUSS BOTH THE </p><p>POSSIBILITY OF MOVING ANO OPERATIONS TO BAGHDAD AND THE </p><p>STATUS OF ABU NIDAL\'S PROPERTY (CHICKEN FARMS) IN IRAQ. </p><p>AT THAT TIME, HIS SOURCES SAID IRAQ HAD POLITELY REFUSED </p><p>TO READMIT THE ANO.  SIMILAR INFORMATION WAS </p><p>SUBSEQUENTLY REPORTED IN OTHER CHANNELS. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) BEGIN CURRENT REPORT OF FRENCH TERRORISM EXPERT: </p><p>ACCORDING TO TWO NON-PALESTINIAN SOURCES -- ONE OF WHOM </p><p>WAS IN IRAQ WEEK OF MAY 28, ABU NIDAL HAD VERY RECENTLY </p><p>ARRIVED IN BAGHDAD FOR QUOTE HEALTH TREATMENTS END </p><p>QUOTE.  HE IS NOT PARTICULARLY ILL, BUT IS SPENDING TIME </p><p>IN A HOSPITAL FOR REST GIVEN HIS GENERALLY WEAKENED </p><p>PHYSICAL STATE.  THE MOVE IS THE RESULT OF PRESSURE ON </p><p>LIBYA FROM ITS NORTH AFRICAN NEIGHBORS AND ABU NIDAL\'S </p><p>DESIRE TO FIND A NEW BASE OF OPERATIONS.  THERE IS NO </p><p>WORD AS TO HOW LONG THE HEALTH TREATMENTS WILL TAKE OR </p><p>IF IRAQ HAS AUTHORIZED ABU NIDAL TO PLAN OR LAUNCH </p><p>OPERATIONS WHILE IN IRAQ. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) THE LATE APRIL ATTEMPTED ASSASSINATION OF ANO </p><p>DISSIDENT ISA IN ALGIERS GENERATED A MINI-GOVERNMENTAL </p><p>CRISIS IN ALGIERS.  FIRST, THE ASSAILANTS SOUGHT REFUGE </p><p>IN THE HOME OF THE FORMER CHIEF OF MILITARY INTELLIGENCE </p><p>AND HID THERE FOR TWO DAYS BEFORE BEING DISCOVERED. </p><p>THIS SPARKED A SHARP DEBATE ABOUT HOW INVOLVED THE </p><p>FORMER ALGERIAN OFFICIAL HAD BEEN IN THE ATTACK.  WHEN </p><p>THE ALGERIANS DETAINED THE ASSAILANTS AND PROTESTED TO </p><p>ANO, ABU NIDAL SENT BACK CLEAR THREATS TO TAKE COUNTER </p><p>HOSTAGES, AMONG OTHER THINGS.  THE ALGERIANS THEN </p><p>PROTESTED TO QADAFHI, ARGUING THAT IT WAS COMPLETELY </p><p>UNACCEPTABLE FOR LIBYA TO ALLOW SUCH OPERATIONS TO BE </p><p>LAUNCHED AND SUCH THREATS TO BE MADE FROM ITS TERRITORY </p><p>AGAINST LIBYA\'S NEIGHBORS, ESPECIALLY IN AN ERA OF </p><p>REGIONAL INTEGRATION.  TUNISIA MADE SIMILAR STRONG </p><p>DEMARCHES, GIVEN WORRIES THAT ANO WOULD LAUNCH ATTACKS </p><p>AGAINST ANO DISSIDENTS IN TUNIS.  (EXPERT NOTED THAT ANO </p><p>HAD LAUNCHED OPERATIONS AGAINST DISSIDENTS ELSEWHERE AS </p><p>PART OF AN EFFORT TO DEMONSTRATE THAT IT IS STILL VITAL.) </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) GIVEN THIS PRESSURE, LIBYAN LEADER QADHAFI "GAVE </p><p>HIS PERMISSION" FOR ABU NIDAL TO LEAVE LIBYA.  EXPERT </p><p>SPECULATES THAT QADHAFI MAY HAVE INTERVENED WITH SADDAM </p><p>HUSSEIN TO WIN PERMISSION FOR THE QUOTE MEDICAL END </p><p>QUOTE VISIT BY ABU NIDAL TO BAGHDAD. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) FRENCH EXPERT ADDED THAT IRAQ\'S REPORTED DECISION </p><p>TO ACCEPT AN ABU NIDAL VISIT FITS WITH THE GENERAL </p><p>HARDENING OF ITS STANCE ON THE ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN </p><p>QUESTION.  HE SAID FROM SEPARATE SOURCES HE HAS BEEN </p><p>TOLD THAT AHMED JABRIL SENT A REPRESENTATIVE TO IRAQ FOR </p><p>TALKS ABOUT OPENING AN OFFICE.  NO DECISION HAS </p><p>REPORTEDLY BEEN MADE, BUT JABRIL\'S MOVE HAS GENERATED A </p><p>GOOD DEAL OF CONCERN IN DAMASCUS, EXPERT WAS TOLD. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) EXPERT SAID CONTRARY TO THE POSITIVE SPIN WHICH </p><p>PLO LEADER ABU IYAD PUTS ON HIS INFORMATION ABOUT THE </p><p>ANO, THIS TERRORIST GROUP IS REGAINING STRENGTH AND </p><p>POSES A SERIOUS THREAT.  HE SAYS ANO HAS BEEN PRESSURING </p><p>THE NEW GOVERNMENT IN SUDAN AND THAT THE FIVE ANO </p><p>TERRORISTS HELD THERE WILL REPORTEDLY SOON BE RELEASED. </p><p>(SOURCE ADDED THAT CURRENT SUDANESE GOVERNMENT IN MORE </p><p>FAVORABLY DISPOSED TO ANTI-ISRAELI GROUPS, PARTICULARLY </p><p>THOSE WITH AN ISLAMIC ORIENTATION, THAN PREVIOUS </p><p>REGIME.  THE PALESTINE ISLAMIC JIHAD (PIJ), FOR EXAMPLE, </p><p>REPORTEDLY HAS AN ACTIVE CELL IN THE SUDAN APPARENTLY </p><p>WITH TACIT SUDANESE GOVERNMENT SUPPORT, AND HE SAYS, AND </p><p>PLANS TO BEGIN TRAINING THERE.)  BELGIUM IS ABOUT TO </p><p>SUCCUMB TO ANO PRESSURES TO RELEASE SAYD NASR AND </p><p>PERHAPS PAY A RANSOM TO GET THE REMAINING SILCO HOSTAGES </p><p>BACK, HE SAYS.  END COMMENTS OF FRENCH TERRORISM EXPERT. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) FOR KHARTOUM AND LONDON: WOULD APPRECIATE UPDATE </p><p>ON STATUS OF THE ACROPOLE/SUDAN CLUB FIVE ANO </p><p>PRISONERS.  YOU MAY CITE AN UNCONFIRMED REPORT OF NEW </p><p>ANO PRESSURE ON THE SUDANESE GOVERNMENT AND A POSSIBLE </p><p>RELEASE IN MAKING THIS APPROACH.  WOULD ALSO APPRECIATE </p><p>EMBASSY KHARTOUM\'S VIEW ON SUDANESE GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>ATTITUDE TOWARD TERRORISM AND ON REPORTED PRESENCE OF </p><p>TERRORIST GROUPS, SUCH AS PIJ, IN SUDAN. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>KIMMITT </p><p></p></div>
