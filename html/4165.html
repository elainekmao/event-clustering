BOGGS.  REASON:  1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) King Gyanendra\'s dismissal of the government of </p><p>former Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba and appointment of </p><p>an interim government have spotlighted long-standing </p><p>tensions--and mutual suspicions--between the political </p><p>parties and the Palace.  Conversations with leaders of the </p><p>two largest political parties reveal a deep-seated mistrust </p><p>of the King and his motives that interprets his action as </p><p>part of a carefully orchestrated plan to sideline and </p><p>undermine the parties.  The Palace, for its part, has made </p><p>little effort so far to mask its disdain for the self-serving </p><p>political leaders.  India reportedly is undertaking a </p><p>campaign to persuade Nepal\'s leading politicians to take part </p><p>in the interim government.  Given India\'s influence in </p><p>Nepal\'s domestic politics, at least some of the </p><p>parties--perhaps the Communist Party of Nepal - United </p><p>Marxist Leninist (UML)--may take the bait.  Unfortunately, </p><p>only the Maoists, with their well-known proclivity for </p><p>driving wedges among competing political interests, stand to </p><p>benefit from the ongoing polarization between the Palace and </p><p>the parties.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>PARTY/PALACE POLARITY </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  Since King Gyanendra\'s October 11 appointment of an </p><p>interim government under Prime Minister Lokendra Bahadur </p><p>Chand, the mainstream political parties have remained </p><p>pointedly aloof from the Cabinet.  The stalemate is fueling a </p><p>growing polarity between the Palace and parties that could </p><p>undermine any efforts to re-establish dialogue with the </p><p>Maoists.  When the King used his constitutional authority to </p><p>sack the government of former Prime Minister Sher Bahadur </p><p>Deuba October 4, he invited all of the mainstream political </p><p>parties to give him, within five days, nominations of members </p><p>to an interim Cabinet.  One week later, when the parties </p><p>ostensibly failed to provide him the nominations within the </p><p>stipulated deadline, the King appointed his own candidate, </p><p>Lokendra Bahadur Chand, as caretaker Prime Minister, as well </p><p>as eight other members of an interim Cabinet.  The </p><p>politicians immediately cried foul, with the leaders of the </p><p>two largest political parties, the Nepali Congress and the </p><p>Communist Party of Nepal - United Marxist Leninist (UML), </p><p>crying the loudest and longest.  Despite PM Chand\'s overtures </p><p>to party leaders to nominate members to fill the remaining </p><p>seven vacant slots in his Cabinet, only the Nepal Sadbhavana </p><p>Party, whose Acting President Badri Prasad Mandal the King </p><p>made Deputy PM, has announced it is ready to take Chand up on </p><p>his offer.  (We expect Chand\'s National Democratic Party, </p><p>a.k.a RPP, to make a similar announcement soon.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)   The Palace\'s version of events thus far is fairly </p><p>straightforward.  The King, acting on a commitment to </p><p>multi-party democracy, invited the parties\' participation in </p><p>the interim government, but the parties, recalcitrant and </p><p>fractious as usual, could not agree on a slate of names </p><p>within the stipulated time frame.  The King\'s previously </p><p>stated commitment to multi-party democracy and holding </p><p>elections as early as possible, however, remains unchanged. </p><p>He has told us that he consulted constitutional experts </p><p>before undertaking his action, and is confident of its </p><p>constitutionality.  The Chand government continues to seek </p><p>the parties\' nominations for the rest of the Cabinet, as well </p><p>as their consensus on an early date for elections (Ref A). </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  The two largest parties, however, tell a somewhat </p><p>different story.  Conversations with Nepali Congress </p><p>President and former PM G.P. Koirala and UML leader Madhav </p><p>Nepal, as well as with other members of the Nepali Congress </p><p>and UML leadership, reveal a long-standing, deep-seated </p><p>mistrust of the Palace and its motives--with some even </p><p>intimating the current imbroglio is the outcome of a </p><p>carefully hatched plot by the King and his royalist cronies </p><p>to undermine democracy.  They view the affable, ever-amenable </p><p>Chand as no more than a stooge to carry out the Palace\'s </p><p>bidding.  Koirala and Nepal have each recounted events that </p><p>suggest the Palace misrepresented its intentions in private </p><p>consultations with the parties.  According to both Koirala </p><p>and Nepal, in private audiences on or before October 11 the </p><p>King asked for their approval of Chand as PM.  Both tell us </p><p>they gave their approval--or at least offered no </p><p>objection--with the understanding that the new PM would then </p><p>consult with the party leaders on nominations for the rest of </p><p>the Cabinet.  That consultation would preserve "the spirit of </p><p>Clause 128" of the Constitution, in their view, which covered </p><p>the formation of the the first Cabinet under democracy. </p><p>Clause 128 stipulated that that first Cabinet consist of </p><p>\'representatives of the main political parties" chosen on the </p><p>recommendation of the Prime Minister.  Both tell us they went </p><p>away from their meetings with the belief that the King had </p><p>agreed to that arrangement--only to be surprised late October </p><p>11 by the announcement of eight other Cabinet members along </p><p>with Chand.  (The Nepal Sadbhavana Party leadership did not </p><p>know its Acting President was to be join the Cabinet until </p><p>the announcement, according to the party\'s General Secretary.) </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  Besides feeling they had been hoodwinked, Koirala </p><p>and Nepal cited an additional barrier to their parties\' </p><p>participation in Chand\'s Cabinet.  Both argue that the King </p><p>has never actually ceded to the new PM the executive power he </p><p>assumed after his October 4 dismissal of Deuba.  (Koirala </p><p>said Chand had admitted as much to him, adding that the King, </p><p>rather than Chand, picked the rest of the Cabinet.)  The lack </p><p>of executive authority makes Chand no more than "a titular </p><p>Prime Minister," Koirala told us, and his Cabinet a "puppet </p><p>government," in Nepal\'s view, which would be "suicidal" for </p><p>any self-respecting democratic party to join.  A Prime </p><p>Minister should be accountable to the people first, rather </p><p>than to the Palace, Nepal noted.  Under the current </p><p>situation, however, the reverse holds true, he asserted.  "If </p><p>the government is only a tool (of the Palace), why should we </p><p>join?" </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  Both Koirala and Nepal argue that the interim </p><p>government needs the political parties to gain popular </p><p>support.  Koirala said he had advised the King to form a </p><p>Cabinet with political party members to give himself a buffer </p><p>between the vicissitudes of government and popular </p><p>discontent.  The King violated the preamble of the </p><p>Constitution, which awards sovereignty to the people, when he </p><p>arrogated executive powers to himself, Koirala charged.  Both </p><p>Nepal and Koirala said the King must "correct his mistakes" </p><p>by giving Chand the authority to reform his Cabinet in the </p><p>"spirit of Clause 128," i.e., in consultation with the </p><p>parties, if he truly wants to broaden partisan participation </p><p>in the caretaker government.  The UML might take part in such </p><p>a reformed Cabinet; Koirala\'s Nepali Congress, he claims, </p><p>would stay out, but would not agitate against it. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>GYANENDRA:  "AMBITIOUS" AND DECISIVE </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  Some observers who have met the King describe him as </p><p>shrewd, articulate, and far more decisive than his late </p><p>brother.  One former Nepali ambassador to the UK who knew </p><p>Gyanendra years before he became King describes him as </p><p>"ambitious" and critical of his late brother\'s passivity </p><p>during the drive for democracy.  Others, while stopping short </p><p>of criticizing the King himself, say they are uneasy because </p><p>of the close coterie of pro-monarchist advisors that surround </p><p>him.  In private discussions (both with the Ambassador and as </p><p>reported by other interlocutors), the King has made no secret </p><p>of his impatience with the political parties, citing them for </p><p>corruption, self-interest, and ineffectuality in dealing with </p><p>the Maoists, points echoed by the Royal Nepal Army </p><p>leadership.  Despite this antipathy, at least some of the </p><p>King\'s advisors agree that the new government needs </p><p>multiparty participation--both to afford the King political </p><p>cover and to make the government more credible to Nepalis and </p><p>to the international community.  (No one, however, makes the </p><p>argument that including the parties will increase the </p><p>government\'s effectiveness or competence.)  The King\'s </p><p>rigidity in setting conditions for participation in the </p><p>government has made it increasingly difficult for the parties </p><p>to accept his terms.  We have heard reports that the Indian </p><p>government, through its Embassy in Kathmandu, will step up </p><p>efforts over the next few weeks to persuade political parties </p><p>to take part in the government.  To make this work, the </p><p>Palace may have to back down from some of its previous </p><p>preconditions for Cabinet membership--perhaps scrapping the </p><p>prohibition against members contesting the next election. </p><p>(We have heard reports that the King may be willing to do </p><p>this.)  In addition, the Indians may ask that the King make </p><p>clear that he has handed back executive power to the Prime </p><p>Minister. </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>THE MAOISTS </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) But the mainstream parties and the Palace are only </p><p>part of the political equation.  The Maoists, who seem to </p><p>thrive on the political factionalization endemic in Nepal, </p><p>must also be factored in.  The insurgents have responded in </p><p>typically cryptic fashion to interim government overtures for </p><p>dialogue, neither categorically ruling them out nor accepting </p><p>them.  Instead, they have called for the King, members of </p><p>political parties, and civil society to work together toward </p><p>"a conducive atmosphere" for dialogue--predicated on the </p><p>well-nigh impossible condition of the King first agreeing to </p><p>a constituent assembly to draft a new constitution.  (Note: </p><p>In Maoist parlance, revision of the Constitution is shorthand </p><p>for severing the King\'s authority over the Army and other </p><p>changes that would provide a foothold for the </p><p>militants--including ultimate abolition of the monarchy--in </p><p>the Nepali power system.  End note.) In the meantime, they </p><p>are keeping up their campaign of killing, extortion, and </p><p>strike-calling, confident that the stalemate between the </p><p>parties and the Palace will keep the heat off them. </p><p>Pratyoush Onta, a Nepali scholar, told us the Maoists are </p><p>masters of the art of obfuscation and "rhetorical confusion," </p><p>never missing a chance to sow dissension among various </p><p>political forces and reap advantage from polarities that may </p><p>develop.  Unfortunately, Onta says, the parties--and now, </p><p>apparently, the Palace as well--time and time again play into </p><p>the Maoists\' hands, allowing themselves to be manipulated </p><p>into the insurgents\' divide-and-conquer game. </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  Mistrust of the Palace by political leaders like </p><p>G.P. Koirala and Madhav Nepal is an outgrowth of the years of </p><p>repression and personal hardship suffered in the struggle </p><p>leading to the restoration of democracy in 1990. </p><p>Unfortunately, the current King\'s firmness in dealing with </p><p>the parties--as well as his alleged disingenuousness in </p><p>revealing his intentions--have done little to dispel that </p><p>mistrust.  The King may well have cause to be impatient with </p><p>the parties\' penchant for bickering and preoccupation with </p><p>short-term political gain.  But the King needs the parties\' </p><p>participation--and their popular base, however battered--if </p><p>the interim government is to accomplish the many ambitious </p><p>tasks set for it, such as setting a date for elections and </p><p>initiating dialogue with the Maoists.  Without the parties\' </p><p>participation, the King\'s reassurances of his commitment to </p><p>multi-party democracy and early elections will begin to wear </p><p>thin.  Presenting a united front before the Maoists, </p><p>moreover, has to be the first step in seeking dialogue with </p><p>the insurgents.  Otherwise, the insurgents can later renege </p><p>on any agreement reached, claiming it did not have popular </p><p>support.  Like it or not, the King must offer the parties </p><p>some face-saving concession--perhaps scrapping the </p><p>prohibition against Cabinet members contesting the election </p><p>and/or allowing Chand to restructure the Cabinet--if he truly </p><p>wants to obtain the multi-partisan, consensus government he </p><p>says he wants.  The question then will be whether the party </p><p>leaders will rise above their narrow personal and partisan </p><p>interests and work together, under the King\'s leadership, for </p><p>the good of the nation and the restoration of full democracy. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
