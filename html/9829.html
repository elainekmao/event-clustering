<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L COLOMBO 001344 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS, S/CT; NSC FOR E. MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:   DECL: 08-01-13 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, PINS, MOPS, CE, NO, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  In discussion with Charge\', Norwegian </p><p>Ambassador reviews upcoming visit by Tigers to France </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  Colombo 1339, and previous </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by James F. Entwistle, Charge\' </p><p>d\'Affaires. Reasons 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1.   (C) The Charge\' met August 1 with Norwegian </p><p>Ambassador Hans Brattskar to discuss the latest news </p><p>regarding Sri Lanka\'s peace process.  Concerning a </p><p>recent camp put in place by the Liberation Tigers of </p><p>Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in the east, Brattskar said there is </p><p>no sign of movement on the issue.  (Note:  The Tigers </p><p>have refused to vacate the camp, despite a ruling by the </p><p>Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission, "SLMM," that its </p><p>establishment violates the February 2002 ceasefire </p><p>accord -- see Reftels.)  He added that there was some </p><p>hope that LTTE political chief S.P. Thamilchelvam\'s </p><p>ongoing visit to eastern Sri Lanka may presage some </p><p>change in the Tigers\' heretofore hard-line stance, but </p><p>it was not yet clear.  Charge\' asked that the Norwegian </p><p>facilitators keep the U.S. apprised of the situation. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) With respect to the larger peace process </p><p>picture, Brattskar had some interesting new information. </p><p>According to his account, Thamilchelvam and a delegation </p><p>of Tiger cadre plan to head to France within the next </p><p>two weeks to attend a seminar on legal issues.  (Note: </p><p>The issues under discussion at the seminar would involve </p><p>the debate over the formation of a Tiger-dominated </p><p>interim administration in the north/east, as well as </p><p>federalism issues linked with a potential final </p><p>settlement of the dispute.)  Brattskar confirmed that </p><p>the French government had approved the Tigers\' </p><p>participation on July 31, after considerable internal </p><p>debate.  The French agreed to host, he noted, when </p><p>assured that the seminar would be run in a very low-key </p><p>manner.  (Note:  Due to the French sensitivities, </p><p>Brattskar asked that we keep their decision close-hold.) </p><p>He said the Tigers were quite enthusiastic about the GoF </p><p>decision, hoping that it indicated some sort of thawing </p><p>in western countries\' negative view of the LTTE.  (Note: </p><p>Brattskar noted that the Canadian government, which had </p><p>been approached to host the seminar, had decided not </p><p>to.)  Brattskar added that it was not yet clear whether </p><p>Tiger spokesman Anton Balasingham, who is based in </p><p>London, would participate in any way in the seminar. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Comment:  The news re the controversial camp is </p><p>still not what the Norwegians, the GSL, and virtually </p><p>everyone else wants to hear, i.e., the LTTE has vacated </p><p>the site.  The Tigers are being quite stubborn on the </p><p>matter, so it is undoubtedly going to take some more </p><p>time to resolve.  Concerning the seminar in France, </p><p>Brattskar remarked that he thought it what was a genuine </p><p>effort by the Tigers to learn more about </p><p>constitutional/legal issues.  It is the case that the </p><p>sum of Tiger expertise on such issues hovers around </p><p>zero, which they readily admit.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>ENTWISTLE </p><p></p></div>
