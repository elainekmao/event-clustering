<p>UNCLAS KHARTOUM 08257 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>S/CT FOR REAP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PTER, SU </p><p>SUBJECT: SUDAN: \'92 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 338430 </p><p> </p><p>1. FOLLOWING IRANIAN PRESIDENT RAFSANJANI\'S </p><p>VISIT TO KHARTOUM IN DECEMBER, 1991, THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT OF SUDAN HAS ATTEMPTED TO INCREASE </p><p>ITS POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC TIES WITH IRAN, A </p><p>PROMINENT MEMBER OF THE USG LIST OF STATE </p><p>SPONSORS OF TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>-  CONCURRENTLY, THE INVASIVE AND DOMINEERING </p><p>ROLE OF THE NATIONAL ISLAMIC FRONT OVER THE </p><p>SUDANESE GOVERNMENT AND SOCIETY IN GENERAL HAS </p><p>PRODUCED AN ENVIRONMENT WITHIN SUDAN THAT IS </p><p>INCREASINGLY TOLERANT OF, AND ATTRACTIVE TO, </p><p>BOTH RADICAL, REJECTIONIST ARABS AND </p><p>TERRORISTS. </p><p> </p><p>-  THE ABSENCE OF VISA REQUIREMENTS FOR ANY </p><p>ETHNIC ARAB DESIRING ENTRY INTO SUDAN HAS </p><p>RESULTED IN THE PRESENCE OF A MYRIAD COLLECTION </p><p>OF FUNDAMENTALIST ZEALOTS AND TERRORIST </p><p>ORGANISATION AFFILIATES THAT CHALLENGE </p><p>MONITORING EFFORTS. </p><p> </p><p>2  THE SUDANESE GOVERNMENT DID NOT EXTRADITE OR </p><p>REQUEST THE EXTRADITION OF ANY SUSPECTED </p><p>TERRORISTS IN 1992. </p><p> </p><p>3.  THE GOVERNMENT OF SUDAN UNDERTOOK NO </p><p>COUNTER-TERRORISM EFFORTS IN 1992. </p><p> </p><p>4. IN ADDITION TO ITS CLOSER RELATIONS WITH </p><p>IRAN, THE GOVERNMENT OF SUDAN MAINTAINED STRONG </p><p>RELATIONS WITH OTHER USG DEFINED SPONSORS OF </p><p>STATE TERRORISM SUCH AS IRAQ AND LIBYA. </p><p>CONSISTENT WITH ITS SUPPORT FOR IRAQ DURING THE </p><p>GULF WAR, SUDAN HAS CONTINUED ITS ACTIVE SUPPORT </p><p>OF IRAQ IN THAT COUNTRY\'S CURRENT DEFIANCE OF </p><p>UNITED NATIONS MEASURES AND THE POLICIES OF THE </p><p>COALITION POWERS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  DURING 1992, SUDAN\'S SELF-ISOLATION BOTH </p><p>FROM THE WESTERN COUNTRIES AND FROM ITS MODERATE </p><p>ARAB NEIGHBORS HAS GROWN SIGNIFICANTLY.  SAUDI </p><p>ARABIA, ALGERIA AND EGYPT HAVE EXPERIENCED </p><p>STRAINS IN THEIR RELATIONS WITH THE KHARTOUM </p><p>GOVERNMENT.  FOLLOWING NUMEROUS ACCUSATIONS OF </p><p>SUDANESE INVOLVMENT IN TUNISIAN INTERNAL </p><p>AFFAIRS, THE SUDANESE EMBASSY IN TUNIS, AND THE </p><p>TUNISIAN EMBASSY IN KHARTOUM, WERE CLOSED. </p><p> </p><p>6. THE PALESTINIAN LIBERATION ORGANISATION HAS </p><p>MAINTAINED A PROMINENT AND OFFICIALLY RECOGNIZED </p><p>PRESENCE IN SUDAN SINCE ITS 1982 REMOVAL FROM </p><p>BEIRUT.  THIS HAS IN TURN FOSTERED THE PRESENCE </p><p>IN SUDAN OF NUMEROUS SPLINTER GROUPS AND </p><p>FACTIONS OF THIS ORGANISATION.  ADDITIONALLY, </p><p>PLO CHAIRMAN YASSIR ARAFAT TRAVELLED TO SUDAN </p><p>SEVERAL TIMES DURING 1992.  THERE ARE REPORTS OF </p><p>MEMBERS OF OTHER TERRORIST GROUP ENJOYING </p><p>SAFEHAVEN IN SUDAN AS WELL. </p><p> </p><p>7.  ALTHOUGH THE SUDANESE GOVERNMENT HAS </p><p>COMPLIED IN GENERAL WITH THE U.N. SECURITY </p><p>COUNCIL\'S MANDATORY SANCTIONS RESOLUTIONS ON </p><p>LIBYA, THERE HAS BEEN NO INDICATION OF ANY </p><p>SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION OF THE OFFICIAL LIBYAN </p><p>PRESENCE IN SUDAN. </p><p> </p><p>PETTERSON </p><p></p></div>
