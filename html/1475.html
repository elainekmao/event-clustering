REASONS: 1.5 </p><p>(B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) THE RULING ZANU-PF WON A SPECIAL PARLIAMENTARY BY- </p><p>ELECTION IN THE RURAL BIKITA CONSTITUENCY JANUARY 13-14, </p><p>RECLAIMING THE SEAT FROM THE OPPOSITION MOVEMENT FOR </p><p>DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC).   TURNOUT WAS HIGHER THAN FOR THE </p><p>JUNE PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION AND A HEAVY POLICE PRESENCE </p><p>HELPED ENSURE THAT VOTING WAS GENERALLY PEACEFUL.  HOWEVER, </p><p>TACTICS OF INTIMIDATION AND VIOLENCE BY ZANU-PF, AS WELL AS </p><p>REPORTED VOTE-BUYING, PRIOR TO THE ELECTION DAYS LIKELY </p><p>KEPT MANY POTENTIAL MDC SUPPORTERS AWAY FROM THE POLLS AND </p><p>ENCOURAGED A LARGER-THAN-EXPECTED TURNOUT FOR ZANU-PF. </p><p>BASED ON THESE SERIOUS IRREGULARITIES, WE CANNOT </p><p>CHARACTERIZE THE WEEKEND POLL AS FREE AND FAIR.  THE </p><p>UNFORTUNATE LESSON THAT ZANU-PF WILL TAKE AWAY FROM THIS </p><p>ELECTION IS THAT TERROR, PARTICULARLY IN RURAL AREAS, IS AN </p><p>EFFECTIVE SHORT-TERM TOOL IN ITS QUEST TO HOLD ON TO POWER. </p><p>POLITBURO MEMBER AND YOUTH DEVELOPMENT MINISTER BORDER GEZI </p><p>CONFIRMED THAT ZIMBABWE IS LIKELY TO SEE MORE OF THE SAME </p><p>TACTICS IN THE RUNUP TO THE 2002 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION WHEN </p><p>HE SAID PUBLICLY THAT THE DEVELOPMENTS IN BIKITA WERE ONLY </p><p>THE "WARNING SHOTS."  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>ZANU RECLAIMS BIKITA SEAT FROM MDC </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00292  01 OF 03  161527Z </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) THE RULING ZANU-PF WON A SPECIAL PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>ELECTION JANUARY 13-14 IN THE RURAL BIKITA WEST </p><p>CONSTITUENCY IN MASVINGO PROVINCE, RECLAIMING A SEAT IT HAD </p><p>LOST TO THE OPPOSITION MDC IN THE JUNE 2000 PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>ELECTIONS.  ZANU WON 12,993 VOTES AND THE MDC 7001, AS </p><p>ROUGHLY HALF OF THE CONSTITUENCY\'S REGISTERED VOTERS CAST </p><p>BALLOTS.  THE LARGE SIZE OF THE NEARLY 6000-VOTE MARGIN WAS </p><p>SURPRISING, GIVEN THAT THE MDC WON BY 281 VOTES LAST JUNE. </p><p>5500 MORE PEOPLE VOTED IN THIS BY-ELECTION THAN IN THE </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION. </p><p> </p><p>VOTING MOSTLY PEACEFUL, BUT SOME VIOLENCE AND INTIMIDATION </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) POLOFF OBSERVED THE ELECTION ALONG WITH </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES FROM A NUMBER OF EU MISSIONS, NORWAY, AND </p><p>CANADA.  LONG QUEUES FORMED AT MOST POLLING CENTERS EARLY </p><p>IN THE MORNING OF JANUARY 13, BUT BEGAN TO TAPER OFF IN THE </p><p>AFTERNOON AND ON THE SECOND DAY OF VOTING.   POLLING AGENTS </p><p>FOR BOTH THE MDC AND ZANU WERE PRESENT INSIDE EVERY POLLING </p><p>CENTER, IN ADDITION TO THE ELECTION OFFICIALS AND DOMESTIC </p><p>MONITORS.  THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF VOTERS WERE WOMEN, </p><p>MANY OVER THE AGE OF 40.  WE WERE TOLD THAT MOST OF THE </p><p>YOUNGER MEN FROM BIKITA WERE EITHER WORKING IN URBAN AREAS </p><p>OR HAD BEEN SENT AWAY BY THEIR FAMILIES AS THEY HAD BEEN </p><p>THE PRINCIPAL TARGETS OF THE PRE-ELECTION VIOLENCE BECAUSE </p><p>THEY WERE ASSUMED TO BE MDC SUPPORTERS.  THIS FACT MIGHT </p><p>ACCOUNT IN PART FOR THE MDC\'S POORER SHOWING, IN THE </p><p>OPINION OF MANY OBSERVERS WITH WHOM WE SPOKE. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00292  01 OF 03  161527Z </p><p>4.  (C) IN CONTRAST TO THE PRE-ELECTION PERIOD, THE </p><p>ELECTION DAYS WERE GENERALLY PEACEFUL.  DESPITE THE </p><p>SIGNIFICANT PRESENCE OF HEAVILY-ARMED POLICE THROUGHOUT THE </p><p>CONSTITUENCY (POLOFF PASSED THROUGH FIVE ROADBLOCKS MANNED </p><p>BY POLICE CARRYING AK-47\'S), HOWEVER, THERE WERE SEVERAL </p><p>INCIDENTS OF VIOLENCE AND INTIMIDATION.  AT ONE POLLING </p><p>STATION, A GROUP OF WAR VETERANS WAS CLEARLY AN </p><p>INTIMIDATING PRESENCE, AS THEY STOOD NEAR THE LINE OF </p><p>PEOPLE WAITING TO VOTE.  ONE OF THE WOMEN STANDING IN LINE </p><p>TOLD US SHE HAD ONLY SHOWN UP BECAUSE HER AREA\'S HEADMAN, </p><p>OR SUBCHIEF, HAD TOLD HER TO DO SO.  IN A SEPARATE INCIDENT </p><p>THE DAY BEFORE THE ELECTION, WAR VETERANS OCCUPIED ONE </p><p>POLLING CENTER (MUTIKIZIZI PRIMARY SCHOOL) AND FORCED THE </p><p>MDC \'S POLLING AGENTS AND DOMESTIC ELECTION MONITORS TO </p><p>LEAVE.  POLICE REINFORCEMENTS ARRIVED SOON THEREAFTER TO </p><p>RESTORE CONTROL. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) ON THE FIRST DAY OF VOTING, SOME 20 WAR VETERANS </p><p>RETURNED TO MUTIKIZIZI POLLING CENTER, BEAT SEVERELY ONE OF </p><p>TWO MDC POLLING AGENTS, AND DROVE OFF WITH HIM.  (COMMENT: </p><p>WE ARE TRYING TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE POLLING AGENT WAS </p><p>SUBSEQUENTLY RELEASED.  END COMMENT.)  ACCORDING TO A </p><p>DOMESTIC MONITOR AT THE SCENE, THE GROUP WAS ACCOMPANIED BY </p><p>ZANU-PF MP AND WAR VETERANS LEADER CHENJERAI "HITLER" </p><p>HUNZVI, WHO ORCHESTRATED THE GOVERNMENT\'S PRE-ELECTION </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ4512 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  00292  02 OF 03  161527Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DINT-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00   FBIE-00  VC-00 </p><p>      H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00 </p><p>      AC-01    NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00 </p><p>      PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00 </p><p>      PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-02   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00 </p><p>        /011W </p><p>                  ------------------B6E194  161527Z /38 </p><p>P 161526Z JAN 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 8007 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 HARARE 000292 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR WILLIAMS </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL. 01/16/11 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PINS, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: ZANU RECLAIMS PARLIAMENTARY SEAT FROM OPPOSITION </p><p>IN BIKITA BY-ELECTION </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  00292  02 OF 03  161527Z </p><p>INTIMIDATION CAMPAIGN.  HUNZVI WAS UBIQUITOUS DURING THE </p><p>VOTING, AS HE TRAVELLED THROUGHOUT THE CONSTITUENCY IN A </p><p>ZANU-PF VEHICLE.   HE STOLE ONE MONITOR\'S IDENTIFYING VEST </p><p>AND HARASSED ANOTHER YOUNG MONITOR, TELLING HER SHE HAD NO </p><p>RIGHT TO BE AT THE POLLING STATION.   WE OBSERVED ANOTHER </p><p>MAN DRIVING A ZANU-PF VEHICLE WHO ENTERED ONE POLLING </p><p>CENTER AFTER ANOTHER WITHOUT CREDENTIALS OF ANY KIND. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) IN ANOTHER INCIDENT, A CAR CARRYING AN EU OBSERVER </p><p>SENT FROM BRUSSELS, AS WELL AS DIPLOMATS FROM THE DUTCH AND </p><p>CANADIAN EMBASSIES HERE, WAS STOPPED BY A SENIOR POLICE </p><p>OFFICER, WHO TOLD THE PASSENGERS THAT DIPLOMATS HAD NO </p><p>RIGHT TO BE IN THE CONSTITUENCY.  THE EU OBSERVER INFORMED </p><p>THE OFFICER THAT THE COMMANDING POLICE OFFICER FOR THE </p><p>PROVINCE AND THE NATIONAL AND REGIONAL GOVERNMENT ELECTION </p><p>OFFICIALS WERE AWARE OF, AND HAD NO OBJECTIONS TO, THEIR </p><p>PRESENCE.  DESPITE THEIR EXPLANATION, THE DIPLOMATS WERE </p><p>ASKED TO LEAVE BIKITA CONSTITUENCY AND WERE UNABLE TO </p><p>SECURE PERMISSION TO RETURN UNTIL THE SECOND DAY OF VOTING. </p><p>THE OTHER THREE CARS PARTICIPATING IN THE OBSERVER EFFORT, </p><p>INCLUDING POLOFF\'S, DID NOT EXPERIENCE SIMILAR DIFFICULTIES </p><p>AND WERE ALLOWED TO CIRCULATE FREELY. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) WE OBSERVED TWO TRENDS DURING THE ELECTION WHICH </p><p>PROVIDED AN OPPORTUNITY FOR FRAUD OR INTIMIDATION.  FIRST, </p><p>BETWEEN 4,000 AND 5,000 VOTERS WERE REPORTEDLY TURNED AWAY, </p><p>EITHER BECAUSE THEIR NAMES WERE NOT ON THE VOTERS\' ROLL OR </p><p>BECAUSE THEY PRESENTED INSUFFICIENT IDENTIFICATION.  THE </p><p>FACT THAT MORE THAN 10% OF REGISTERED VOTERS WERE TURNED </p><p>AWAY IS SIGNIFICANT, ALTHOUGH IT IS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE </p><p>WITHOUT ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE WHETHER THEY WERE LEGITIMATELY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00292  02 OF 03  161527Z </p><p>DENIED THEIR RIGHT TO VOTE.  SECOND, MANY VOTERS WERE </p><p>ELDERLY OR INFIRM AND REQUIRED ASSISTANCE IN CASTING THEIR </p><p>VOTE.  AT EVERY POLLING STATION WE OBSERVED (10 OUT OF 40), </p><p>THOSE REQUIRING SUCH ASSISTANCE WERE ASKED TO STATE ALOUD </p><p>WHOM THEY WANTED TO VOTE FOR, THEN WERE HELPED IN MARKING </p><p>THEIR BALLOTS APPROPRIATELY.  IT IS LIKELY THAT THE </p><p>OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF THESE VOTERS OPTED FOR ZANU-PF, AS </p><p>VOTING FOR THE OPPOSITION COULD ENSURE A VISIT LATER FROM </p><p>HUNZVI AND HIS THUGS. </p><p> </p><p>GOVERNMENT REACTION </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) GOVERNMENT AND ZANU-PF OFFICIALS WERE EBULLIENT, </p><p>HAILING THE BIKITA OUTCOME AS A VINDICATION OF THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S POLICIES.   ZANU-PF\'S SECRETARY OF INFORMATION </p><p>NATHAN SHAMUYARIRA CLAIMED THAT THE WIN WAS EVIDENCE THAT </p><p>ZIMBABWEANS SUPPORT THE GOZ\'S POLICIES ON LAND AND THE </p><p>ECONOMY, AND INSISTED IT FORESHADOWED "THE BEGINNING OF THE </p><p>END OF THE MDC." SPOKESMAN JONATHAN MOYO SAID THE RESULT </p><p>WAS AN INDICATOR OF WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN FUTURE BY-ELECTIONS </p><p>AND THE UPCOMING PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.  POLITBURO MEMBER </p><p>AND YOUTH DEVELOPMENT MINISTER BORDER GEZI\'S COMMENTS WERE </p><p>THE MOST OMINOUS: "WE WOULD LIKE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THE </p><p>ENEMY HAS NO CHANCE IN ANY BY-ELECTION.  IN FACT, THESE ARE </p><p>JUST THE WARNING SHOTS." </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) WE WERE NOT SURPRISED BY ZANU-PF\'S VICTORY.  THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00292  02 OF 03  161527Z </p><p>RULING PARTY WAS EMBARRASSED BY ITS LOSS LAST JUNE IN </p><p>BIKITA WEST, TRADITIONALLY A RURAL ZANU STRONGHOLD, AND </p><p>PULLED OUT ALL THE STOPS TO WIN BACK THIS SEAT, INCLUDING </p><p>THE USE OF WIDESPREAD INTIMIDATION AND DISPENSING OF </p><p>GOVERNMENT LARGESS.  THE MDC LOST SOME 700 VOTES AND ZANU </p><p>PICKED UP ALMOST 5500, INDICATING THAT ZANU-PF WAS </p><p>SUCCESSFUL NOT ONLY IN SUPPRESSING THE MDC\'S SUPPORT BUT </p><p>ALSO IN GETTING ITS OWN VOTERS TO THE POLLS.  ACCORDING TO </p><p>MDC SECRETARY-GENERAL WELSHMAN NCUBE, ZANU INCREASED ITS </p><p>VOTE COUNT IN PART BY ORDERING LOCAL TRADITIONAL LEADERS -- </p><p>WHO ARE ON THE GOVERNMENT PAYROLL -- TO GET OUT THE ZANU </p><p>VOTE ON PAIN OF DEATH.  THE MDC SECRETARY-GENERAL FURTHER </p><p>ALLEGED THAT ZANU-PF ADDED THE NAMES OF APPROXIMATELY 3,000 </p><p>SUPPORTERS TO THE VOTERS\' ROLL AND QUIETLY MOVED THEM INTO </p><p>THE AREA BEFORE THE ELECTION.  UNFORTUNATELY, ZANU-PF\'S </p><p>VICTORY HAS VINDICATED THE PARTY\'S TACTICS OF SUPPRESSION </p><p>AND INTIMIDATION.  JUDGING FROM BORDER GEZI\'S COMMENTS, </p><p>ZIMBABWE IS CERTAIN TO SEE MORE OF THE SAME IN THE RUN-UP </p><p>TO THE 2002 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.  THERE IS NO WAY WE CAN </p><p>CALL THIS BY-ELECTION FREE AND FAIR, AND WE SUSPECT THE MDC </p><p>WILL CHALLENGE THE RESULT IN COURT. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) WITH THE VICTORY IN BIKITA WEST, ZANU NOW CONTROLS </p><p>93 SEATS IN PARLIAMENT, ONLY SEVEN FEWER THAN THE NUMBER </p><p>REQUIRED TO HAVE A FREE HAND IN PASSING CONSTITUTIONAL </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ4513 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  00292  03 OF 03  161527Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DINT-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00   FBIE-00  VC-00 </p><p>      H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00 </p><p>      AC-01    NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00 </p><p>      PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00 </p><p>      PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-02   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00 </p><p>        /011W </p><p>                  ------------------B6E199  161527Z /38 </p><p>P 161526Z JAN 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 8008 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 HARARE 000292 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR WILLIAMS </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL. 01/16/11 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PINS, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: ZANU RECLAIMS PARLIAMENTARY SEAT FROM OPPOSITION </p><p>IN BIKITA BY-ELECTION </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  00292  03 OF 03  161527Z </p><p>AMENDMENTS.
