END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>Talks Make Solid Progress </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) The second session of talks between the Sri </p><p>Lankan government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil </p><p>Eelam (LTTE) made significant progress in moving the </p><p>peace process forward.  (Note:  The session took place </p><p>in Thailand from October 31 - November 3.)  In a </p><p>November 4 phone call from Tokyo, Milinda Moragoda, a </p><p>key member of the government\'s delegation, told the </p><p>Ambassador that "the dynamics and chemistry at the talks </p><p>were excellent."   Moragoda said the talks went so well </p><p>that it was "sort of scary."  (Note:  The Ambassador </p><p>meets Norwegian Ambassador Jon Westborg, who was a </p><p>member of the Norwegian facilitation team in Thailand, </p><p>tonight to review the talks.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Itemizing what was achieved, the Norwegian </p><p>government issued a statement at the close of the talks. </p><p>The statement, text contained in Para 11, included the </p><p>following highlights: </p><p> </p><p>-- The statement said the two sides had "demonstrated a </p><p>positive, pragmatic, and conciliatory approach" at the </p><p>talks and added that the two sides continued to move </p><p>deliberately toward achievement of "a lasting political </p><p>settlement." </p><p> </p><p>-- The two sides confirmed "their strong commitment to </p><p>the (February 2002) ceasefire agreement and their </p><p>support for the Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission." </p><p> </p><p>-- Commenting on the tense situation in ethnically-mixed </p><p>eastern Sri Lanka, the statement said the two sides were </p><p>committed to accommodating "the needs of all three </p><p>communities in the east - Tamils, Muslims, and </p><p>Sinhalese."  (Note:  The Norwegian government issued </p><p>another statement with additional information on plans </p><p>to ease tensions in the east.  This statement is </p><p>contained in Para 12.) </p><p> </p><p>-- The two sides agreed to form the following three sub- </p><p>committees: </p><p> </p><p>- (i) "Immediate Humanitarian and Rehabilitation Needs </p><p>in the North and East" Sub-Committee:  This sub- </p><p>committee will work to identify and prioritize </p><p>assistance-related projects in the north and east.  It </p><p>will also decide on financial allocations and </p><p>implementing agencies for the projects.  The sub- </p><p>committee will also work with the Norwegian government </p><p>on preparations for the November 25 meeting of donor </p><p>governments in Oslo.  The chief GSL representative on </p><p>the sub-committee will be Ambassador Bernard </p><p>Goonetilleke, head of the government\'s Peace </p><p>Secretariat.  The GSL side will include Muslim </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>representation.  The LTTE\'s chief representative will be </p><p>S.P. Thamilchelvam, the head of the LTTE\'s political </p><p>wing.  (Note:  As far as we understand, this sub- </p><p>committee replaces the "Joint Task Force" announced at </p><p>the first round of talks.  Mission had previously heard </p><p>that V. Balakumaran would be the lead LTTE </p><p>representative on this joint body, but Thamilchelvam got </p><p>the nod.  The two sides also reportedly discussed the </p><p>idea of Prime Minister Wickremesinghe and LTTE </p><p>negotiator Anton Balasingham meeting on the margins of </p><p>the Oslo conference.  This would be the highest-level </p><p>GSL-LTTE contact in years if it took place.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>- (ii) "De-escalation and Normalization" Sub-Committee: </p><p>This sub-committee will focus on "facilitating the </p><p>resettlement of internally displaced persons" and easing </p><p>the burden on local communities of the GSL military\'s </p><p>"high security zones."  The chief government </p><p>representative on this sub-committee will be Defense </p><p>Secretary Austin Fernando and the chief LTTE </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>representative will be V. Karuna, the LTTE military </p><p>commander in the east. (Note:  Again, as far as we </p><p>understand, this sub-committee replaces the "Joint </p><p>Committee" focused on "high security zones" announced at </p><p>the first round of talks.) </p><p> </p><p>- (iii) Sub-Committee on "Political Matters":  This sub- </p><p>committee will examine "complex political </p><p>matters...including constitutional, legal, political, </p><p>and administrative issues."  G.L. Peiris, a senior </p><p>minister, will be the chief GSL representative on the </p><p>sub-committee, while the chief LTTE representative will </p><p>be Anton Balasingham, the group\'s spokesman.  Muslim </p><p>leader Rauf Hakeem will also serve on this sub- </p><p>committee. </p><p> </p><p>-- The two sides agreed to the following schedule of </p><p>future talks: </p><p> </p><p>- December 2-5 in Oslo </p><p>- January 6-9, 2003 </p><p>- February 7-10, 2003 </p><p>- March 18-21, 2003 </p><p>(Note:  The December and January timeframes had </p><p>previously been agreed to at the first session of talks </p><p>in September.  The February and March timeframes are </p><p>new.) </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>Positive Tone at Press Conference </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Aside from the constructive results </p><p>encapsulated in the Norwegian statement reviewed above, </p><p>the press conference held at the end of the talks on </p><p>November 3 also set a positive tone.  Noteworthy </p><p>comments included: </p><p> </p><p>-- LTTE senior negotiator Balasingham stated:  "It is </p><p>the ultimate aim of the LTTE to finally enter into the </p><p>democratic political mainstream.  Since we are committed </p><p>to enter the political mainstream, which is of course a </p><p>democratic political mainstream, we have to accept and </p><p>assimilate other political groups and to allow them free </p><p>exercise in the electoral processes.  So, we will allow </p><p>other political parties and groups to participate in the </p><p>north and east." </p><p> </p><p>-- Balasingham also stated, "We may or may not go for an </p><p>interim administration.  What is important is a solution </p><p>that would immediately address humanitarian issues." </p><p> </p><p>-- Norwegian Deputy Foreign Minister Vidar Helgesen </p><p>stated, "The parties are now looking ahead toward peace </p><p>and the prospects look good." </p><p> </p><p>-- Sri Lanka Muslim Congress leader Hakeem stated, "The </p><p>spirit of consensus and compromise...was very much there </p><p>and that was the most redeeming feature of the </p><p>discussions."  Hakeem went on to note that the peace </p><p>process was still at a very early stage. </p><p> </p><p>-- G.L. Peiris, head of the government\'s delegation, </p><p>stated, "It is a fresh start.  (The two sides) have </p><p>virtually agreed to everything.  We have made progress </p><p>that no one thought possible.  We have tangible </p><p>results." </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) (((Note:  Despite the positive noises at the </p><p>press conference, there were some discordant notes heard </p><p>on the margins of the talks.  In what was no surprise, </p><p>for example, LTTE participants in the talks </p><p>categorically rejected a trial court\'s October 30 </p><p>decision convicting V. Prabhakaran, the group\'s leader, </p><p>in absentia of involvement in a 1996 terrorist attack. </p><p>Balasingham stated that the government should not "dig </p><p>up the past."  Thamilchelvam warned that the LTTE could </p><p>also charge GSL officials with human rights abuses if it </p><p>wanted.  For its part, the government has already </p><p>announced that the court ruling will have no impact on </p><p>the peace process -- see Ref B.  In addition to </p><p>complaints about the court ruling, the LTTE has also </p><p>expressed concern about the GSL\'s arrest of six LTTE </p><p>cadre who were on a boat off the eastern coast over the </p><p>weekend.  The government asserts that the boat was </p><p>carrying arms.  End Note.))) </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>Talks make Big Splash in Sri Lanka </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) The talks engendered a positive reaction in </p><p>Sri Lanka.  The results of the talks were widely </p><p>publicized on TV, radio, and in the newspapers.  Media </p><p>reaction was very positive, with most editorials </p><p>praising the talks.  Symbolizing the positive coverage, </p><p>several papers published on their front-page color </p><p>photos of beaming GSL and LTTE officials planting a tree </p><p>commemorating the talks outside the Thai conference </p><p>site.  (Note:  TamilNet, the pro-LTTE website, also </p><p>carried these photos.)  Jehan Perera, the head of the </p><p>National Peace Council, a well-known local think-tank, </p><p>told us he was impressed by how well the two sides </p><p>worked together.  He thought they had formed a real </p><p>"partnership" focused on "getting on with the business </p><p>of peace."  Rohan Ediresinha, an analyst at the Center </p><p>for Policy Alternatives, another well-known think-tank, </p><p>told us that he was "pleasantly surprised by how much </p><p>progress was made at the talks."  He said the two </p><p>delegations "seem to understand each other" and "seem to </p><p>want to make the process work, which was not the case </p><p>during past peace processes." </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) (((Note:  President Kumaratunga\'s office has not </p><p>yet issued a formal public reaction to the talks.  Harim </p><p>Peiris, one of her press spokesmen, told us that the </p><p>president\'s office would announce its stance after it </p><p>receives an "official" briefing from the government. </p><p>Mission has also tried to contact Tamil politicians, but </p><p>they are involved in the celebrations surrounding </p><p>Diwali, a Hindu festival, which is taking place on </p><p>November 4.))) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Based on the positive vibrations emanating from </p><p>the talks, both sides seem to be buying into the peace </p><p>process now more than ever.  Anton Balasingham, in </p><p>particular, seems to want to be perceived as being as </p><p>accommodating as can be.  For the GSL, the results of </p><p>the talks were very encouraging, especially as its peace </p><p>initiative was coming under some criticism of late.  The </p><p>LTTE\'s apparent dedication to the peace track is a big </p><p>help to the government in quelling concerns in the </p><p>south.  At this point, the two sides seem to have formed </p><p>a symbiotic relationship with the aim of strengthening </p><p>the peace process.  While our assessment of the </p><p>situation is not quite as effusive as that of some of </p><p>the press coverage, we are becoming more confident about </p><p>the shelf life of the peace process.  It would seem </p><p>difficult for either side to jettison all that has been </p><p>gained in favor of a return to conflict.  Despite </p><p>Balasingham\'s reassuring words, however, it is still </p><p>extremely difficult to read the LTTE\'s long-term </p><p>intentions. </p><p>9.  (C) (Note:  Mission will wait to speak to Norwegian </p><p>Ambassador Westborg before assessing what role the sub- </p><p>committee on humanitarian issues gives the LTTE in the </p><p>distribution of assistance to the north and east.  Some </p><p>of the press coverage indicates that the LTTE </p><p>essentially agreed to allow the GSL authority over this </p><p>sub-committee.  The language setting up the sub- </p><p>committee is somewhat vague and needs further </p><p>explanation, however.)  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>Suggested Press Statement </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U) Mission plans to issue the following press </p><p>statement on November 5: </p><p> </p><p>BEGIN TEXT: </p><p> </p><p>The U.S. has carefully reviewed the statement issued by </p><p>the Norwegian government outlining the results of the </p><p>second session of negotiations held between the Sri </p><p>Lankan government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil </p><p>Eelam (LTTE) in Thailand from October 31 - November 3. </p><p>We praise the commitment of both sides to sustain the </p><p>ceasefire and move forward with the peace process.  It </p><p>is positive that the two sides have agreed to an </p><p>expanded schedule of meetings in the coming months. </p><p>The U.S. also welcomes the decision of both sides to </p><p>form sub-committees focused on humanitarian, de- </p><p>escalation, and political issues. </p><p> </p><p>The U.S. looks forward to participating in the </p><p>November 25 conference in Oslo, which is focused on </p><p>improving the humanitarian and developmental situation </p><p>in the north and east.  The U.S. is committed to </p><p>continuing its support of these vital objectives through </p><p>projects yielding an immediate impact.  We note, for </p><p>example, that the Quick Reaction Demining Force (QRDF) </p><p>recently completed its highly successful efforts in </p><p>Jaffna.  The U.S. is also working with the Sri Lankan </p><p>government on establishing a humanitarian mine clearance </p><p>training program for civilians and military personnel </p><p>that is scheduled to begin operations in early 2003. </p><p> </p><p>We hope that the negotiating process will lead to a </p><p>permanent end to the conflict based on the principles of </p><p>democracy and respect for human rights, while </p><p>maintaining Sri Lanka\'s territorial integrity.  We are </p><p>very encouraged by the efforts of the two sides to </p><p>resolve the conflict, thus far, and remain convinced </p><p>that conditions are favorable for a desirable outcome </p><p>now more than ever.  We again salute the Norwegian </p><p>government\'s able facilitation of the talks and the Thai </p><p>government for hosting them. </p><p> </p><p>END TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>GoN Statement issued at End of Talks </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>11.  (U) The text of the Norwegian government statement </p><p>issued at the end of the talks follows: </p><p> </p><p>BEGIN TEXT: </p><p> </p><p>November 3, 2002 </p><p> </p><p>The Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL) and the Liberation </p><p>Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) conducted the second </p><p>session of the Sri Lanka Peace Talks at the Rose Garden </p><p>in Thailand from 31 October to 3 November 2002. </p><p> </p><p>The parties demonstrated a positive, pragmatic and </p><p>conciliatory approach in discussing a wide range of </p><p>issues, including present challenges as well as matters </p><p>relating to long-term solutions. The parties thereby </p><p>continued the dual approach of moving step by step </p><p>towards a lasting political settlement, while remaining </p><p>fully focused on the ground situation. The parties </p><p>reconfirmed their strong commitment to the Ceasefire </p><p>Agreement and their support for the Sri Lanka Monitoring </p><p>Mission. </p><p> </p><p>Against the backdrop of recent tensions among the ethnic </p><p>communities in the east, the parties agreed on immediate </p><p>measures to improve the security situation, inter-ethnic </p><p>co-operation and respect for human rights in the north </p><p>and east. Acknowledging that peace belongs to all </p><p>peoples of Sri Lanka, the parties are committed to </p><p>accommodate the needs and aspirations of all three </p><p>communities in the east; Tamils, Muslims, and Sinhalese. </p><p>The agreed measures are outlined in a separate statement </p><p>issued by the Royal Norwegian Government on 1 November </p><p>2002. </p><p> </p><p>In their determination to move the peace process </p><p>forward, the parties reiterated that the process will be </p><p>a long and demanding one. Throughout the process, the </p><p>parties will continuously monitor the ground situation, </p><p>thus enabling necessary action to be taken at all stages </p><p>to ensure further progress. </p><p> </p><p>In the quest for a final settlement, a broad range of </p><p>issues must be addressed with considerable attention to </p><p>detail. For this purpose, the parties agreed on </p><p>establishing, whenever needed, sub-committees to act on </p><p>specific matters under the auspices of the negotiation </p><p>teams. The sub-committees will be continually active and </p><p>report at the sessions of the talks, in order to </p><p>accelerate progress and give in-depth attention to </p><p>issues. </p><p> </p><p>Following the agreement at the first session of talks to </p><p>set up a joint task force, the parties agreed to </p><p>establish this in the form of a Sub-Committee on </p><p>Immediate Humanitarian and Rehabilitation Needs in the </p><p>North and East. The role of the Sub-Committee will be to </p><p> </p><p>- Identify humanitarian and rehabilitation needs </p><p>- Prioritize implementation of activities to meet these </p><p>needs </p><p>- Decide on the allocation of the financial resources </p><p>for such activities </p><p>- Determine implementing agencies for each of the </p><p>activities. </p><p> </p><p>The Sub-Committee will ensure the involvement of all </p><p>ethnic communities so that their needs and aspirations </p><p>are considered, and it will give priority to the </p><p>mobilization of local labor and local institutions in </p><p>the implementation of activities. The activities </p><p>initiated by the Sub-Committee will be financed by a </p><p>fund, which will be set up in accordance with </p><p>arrangements to be agreed upon with donor governments. </p><p>The Sub-Committee will consist of four members selected </p><p>by the LTTE and four by the GOSL. Two members of the </p><p>respective negotiating teams, Mr. Tamilselvan of the </p><p>LTTE and Mr. Bernard Goonetilleke of the GOSL, will be </p><p>leading members of the Sub-Committee. Other GOSL </p><p>representatives will include Mr. M.D.D. Peiris, Mr. </p><p>M.I.M. Rafeek, and an additional member of the Muslim </p><p>community. Other LTTE representatives will include Mr. </p><p>Jay Maheswaran. The Sub-Committee will be assisted by a </p><p>secretariat to be located in the Government Agent\'s </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Office in Killinochchi. Meetings of the Sub-Committee </p><p>will be held in Killinochchi, Colombo, Batticaloa, and </p><p>Kalmunai at the discretion of the committee. </p><p> </p><p>As its first task the Sub-Committee will assist the </p><p>Royal Norwegian Government in preparing for a political- </p><p>level meeting of key governments to take place in Oslo, </p><p>Norway on 25 November 2002. As the first ever of its </p><p>kind, the meeting will demonstrate the unprecedented </p><p>level of international support to Sri Lanka and to the </p><p>parties in their present peace efforts. The meeting will </p><p>aim at mobilizing financial support for immediate </p><p>humanitarian and rehabilitation action in three priority </p><p>areas agreed by the parties: </p><p> </p><p>- Resettling and rehabilitating Internally Displaced </p><p>Persons </p><p>- Rehabilitating war-affected women and children </p><p>- Providing livelihoods for war-affected people in the </p><p>North and East. </p><p> </p><p>The international community will further be encouraged </p><p>to increase investment in Sri Lanka and respond </p><p>positively to new challenges in the south resulting from </p><p>the peace process. </p><p> </p><p>In line with the overall objective of facilitating the </p><p>resettlement of internally displaced persons, the </p><p>parties acted on the decision made at the first session </p><p>of peace talks to address matters relating to high </p><p>security zones and other areas made inaccessible to the </p><p>public. To this end, a Sub-Committee on De-Escalation </p><p>and Normalization was set up as a mechanism for a </p><p>structured dialogue between the parties. While </p><p>accommodating the security concerns of each party, the </p><p>Sub-Committee will examine ways and means to ensure </p><p>resettlement, the return of private property and the </p><p>resumption of economic activities in these areas. This </p><p>Sub-Committee will include high-level civilian and </p><p>military personnel on both sides, including Mr. Austin </p><p>Fernando of the Ministry of Defense and Mr. Karuna of </p><p>the LTTE. </p><p> </p><p>As another issue relating to the restoration of </p><p>normalcy, the status of Tamil prisoners held under the </p><p>Prevention of Terrorism Act was discussed. </p><p> </p><p>The parties remain committed to building peace on the </p><p>ground through practical steps to improve security and </p><p>opportunity in people\'s daily lives. At the same time, </p><p>the parties acknowledged that the peace talks must </p><p>address a series of complex political questions in order </p><p>to reach a negotiated solution to the ethnic conflict, </p><p>including constitutional, legal, political and </p><p>administrative issues. Following discussions, the </p><p>parties agreed to establish a Sub-Committee to commence </p><p>work in connection with relevant political matters. The </p><p>parties agreed that access to expertise on political </p><p>matters will be important in order for them to enter </p><p>into negotiations on issues central to the peace </p><p>process. The parties will jointly and separately address </p><p>in depth, at the current stage of the peace process, </p><p>relevant subjects such as other peace processes, </p><p>political solutions to ethnic conflicts, models and </p><p>systems of government, issues of post-conflict </p><p>transition, co-ordination of international assistance, </p><p>and reconciliation processes. To this end, the parties </p><p>will interact with relevant experts and practitioners in </p><p>these fields, as a basis for the formulation of </p><p>approaches to the critical political issues for </p><p>consideration in the future sessions of the peace talks. </p><p> </p><p>The Sub-Committee on Political Matters will be chaired </p><p>by the heads of delegations to the peace talks, Mr. </p><p>Anton Balasingham and Mr. G.L. Peiris. Other government </p><p>representatives will include Mr. Rauf Hakeem, leader of </p><p>the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress. </p><p>The third session of talks will take place on 2&5 </p><p>December 2002 in Oslo, Norway.  The following sessions </p><p>will be held on 6&9 January 2003, 7&10 February 2003, </p><p>and 18&21 March 2003. </p><p> </p><p>END TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>GoN Statement re Situation in East </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  (U) The text of the Norwegian government statement </p><p>focusing on the situation in the east follows: </p><p> </p><p>BEGIN TEXT: </p><p> </p><p>November 1, 2002 </p><p> </p><p>The Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL) and the Liberation </p><p>Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) initiated the second </p><p>session of the peace talks in Thailand with an </p><p>evaluation of the implementation of the Ceasefire </p><p>Agreement over the past eight months. In their </p><p>determination to consolidate the ceasefire and advance </p><p>the peace process, the parties agreed to a set of </p><p>measures to improve the security situation, inter-ethnic </p><p>cooperation and respect for human rights in the North </p><p>and Eastern Provinces. </p><p> </p><p>In this context, the parties emphasized in particular </p><p>their commitment to accommodate the needs and </p><p>aspirations of all three communities in the east - </p><p>Tamils, Muslims and Sinhalese. The parties set out </p><p>specific measures to improve relations between the </p><p>Muslim and Tamil communities. </p><p> </p><p>The parties agreed to continuously monitor the </p><p>implementation of each of the agreed measures and to </p><p>report on progress at future sessions of the peace </p><p>talks. </p><p> </p><p>In light of the principal challenges in implementing the </p><p>Ceasefire Agreement at this stage, the parties agreed to </p><p>reconstitute the SLMM Local Monitoring Committees, </p><p>established in accordance with paragraph 3.7 of the </p><p>Ceasefire Agreement.
