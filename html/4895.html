IN BOSNIA THE </p><p>DELEGATION MET WITH THE CATHOLIC, MUSLIM AND JEWISH MEMBERS </p><p>OF THE B-H INTER-RELIGIOUS COUNCIL (IRC) WHO ADMITTED </p><p>CONTINUING CHALLENGES IN FORGING RECONCILIATION IN BOSNIA; </p><p>CATHOLIC CARDINAL PULJIC FOCUSED ON NEED FOR REFUGEES TO BE </p><p>ABLE TO RETURN "WITH DIGNITY."  AMBASSADOR NICHOLSON ALSO </p><p>BROKE AWAY FOR A BRIEF MEETING WITH FRANCISCAN FRIAR DZOLAN </p><p>TO DISCUSS THE FRANCISCANS\' ATTITUDE TOWARD RECONCILIATION. </p><p>IN KOSOVO, THE DELEGATION VISITED AN EMBASSY VATICAN- </p><p>SPONSORED PROJECT FOR INTER-ETHNIC RECONCILIATION RUN BY THE </p><p>SANT\'EGIDIO COMMUNITY.

END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>BOSNIAN INTER-RELIGIOUS COUNCIL: MORE WORK TO DO </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>2.  CINC AFSOUTH ADMIRAL JOHNSON INVITED U.S. AMBASSADOR TO </p><p>THE HOLY SEE JIM NICHOLSON TO ACCOMPANY HIM ON A TRIP TO THE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  06156  01 OF 02  301354Z </p><p>BALKANS DECEMBER 19-20, TO MEET WITH RELIGIOUS LEADERS </p><p>WORKING FOR RECONCILIATION IN BOSNIA, AND TO VISIT AN </p><p>EMBASSY VATICAN-SPONSORED RECONCILIATION PROJECT IN PRIZREN, </p><p>YUGOSLAVIA.  IN SARAJEVO AMBASSADOR BOND AND EMBASSY </p><p>SARAJEVO TEAM BRIEFED THE DELEGATION, NOTING THE GOOD </p><p>PROGRESS THE RELIGIOUS GROUPS HAD MADE IN DRAFTING A LAW ON </p><p>RELIGIONS (NOTE: OUR VATICAN CONTACTS BELIEVE THIS DRAFT LAW </p><p>PROVIDES "EXCELLENT GUARANTEES").  BRIEFERS NOTED THAT </p><p>PROBLEMS AMONG THE MOSTLY CATHOLIC CROATS CONTINUE, WITH THE </p><p>VATICAN RELUCTANT TO TAKE ON THE MORE NATIONALISTIC ELEMENTS </p><p>OF ITS OWN CLERGY IN BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA.  THE CROAT </p><p>COMMUNITY HAS DEVELOPED A "MINORITY COMPLEX" AND THROWS UP </p><p>ITS OWN OBSTACLES TO CROAT REFUGEE RETURNS BY INSISTING THAT </p><p>ALL MUNICIPAL SERVICES BE REBUILT BEFORE RETURNS CAN OCCUR. </p><p>CARDINAL PULJIC HAS GREAT CREDIBILITY FROM WEATHERING THE </p><p>WAR IN SARAJEVO, BUT HE SHARES THIS "COMPLEX."  THE CLERGY </p><p>NEED TO LET DOWN THEIR GUARD AND TAKE THE LEAD IN PROMOTING </p><p>INTER-RELIGIOUS RECONCILIATION.  KEY MEASURES TO TAKE EARLY </p><p>ON WOULD BE PROMOTING VISITS TO EACH OTHER\'S PLACES OF </p><p>WORSHIP, AND WORKING TOGETHER ON A SCHOOL CURRICULUM. </p><p> </p><p>3.  AMBASSADOR BOND, ADMIRAL JOHNSON, AMBASSADOR NICHOLSON </p><p>AND STAFF THEN MET WITH THREE OF THE FOUR RELIGIOUS LEADERS </p><p>IN SARAJEVO -- CATHOLIC CARDINAL PULIC, MUSLIM MUFTI CERIC, </p><p>AND JEWISH COMMUNITY LEADER DR. JAKOB FINCI.  THE SERB </p><p>ORTHODOX COMMUNITY WAS NOT REPRESENTED BECAUSE METROPOLITAN </p><p>NIKOLAJ HAD OTHER COMMITMENTS.  CERIC EXPRESSED THE GROUP\'S </p><p>GRATITUDE TO THE US FOR HELPING END THE WAR AND BRINGING </p><p>SECURITY TO BOSNIA. HE WAS POSITIVE ON THE DRAFT LAW ON </p><p>RELIGIONS, NOTING IT WAS NOW BEFORE THE B-H ASSEMBLY.  BOTH </p><p>CERIC AND FINCI SPOKE FRANKLY ABOUT THE CHALLENGES STILL </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  06156  01 OF 02  301354Z </p><p>FACING THE IRC, IN PARTICULAR DIFFICULTIES RESTORING </p><p>PROPERTIES AND DEVELOPING A COMMON PROPOSAL FOR RELIGIOUS </p><p>EDUCATION IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS.  BOTH NOTED BOSNIA\'S LONG </p><p>TRADITION OF RELIGIOUS TOLERANCE AS A SOURCE OF HOPE FOR THE </p><p>FUTURE EVEN AS THEY DECRIED BOSNIAN POLITICAL LEADERS\' </p><p>DEMAGOGUERY ON RELIGIOUS IDENTIFICATION.  PULJIC SAID THERE </p><p>WAS NO ALTERNATIVE TO DIALOGUE AND ADMITTED THERE WAS MUCH </p><p>WORK YET TO BE DONE BEFORE BOSNIA COULD EMBARK ON A PATH </p><p>TOWARD "EUROPE."  PULIC EMPHASIZED, AS PREDICTED, THE NEED </p><p>FOR ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES AND FOR REFUGEES TO BE ABLE TO </p><p>RETURN TO THEIR ORIGINAL ABODES "NOT AS PAUPERS, BUT WITH </p><p>DIGNITY."  ADMIRAL JOHNSON AND AMBASSADOR BOND AND </p><p>AMBASSADOR NICHOLSON URGED THE RELIGIOUS LEADERS TO EXERCISE </p><p>LEADERSHIP. ALL THREE FOCUSED ON THE NEED FOR THE IRC TO DO </p><p>MORE OUTSIDE OF SARAJEVO AND TO SHOW THE WORLD AN EXAMPLE OF </p><p>INTERFAITH RECONCILIATION AND COOPERATION. </p><p> </p><p>4.  AMBASSADOR NICHOLSON BROKE AWAY FOR A SHORT MEETING WITH </p><p>FRANCISCAN FRIAR MIJO DZOLAN, WHO, UNLIKE HIS CROAT </p><p>FRANCISCAN BROTHERS IN AND AROUND MOSTAR, HAS A STRONG TRACK </p><p>RECORD OF PROMOTING INTER-ETHNIC UNITY IN BOSNIA.  HE </p><p>BRIEFED US ON HIS LATEST PROJECT -- A COMMUNITY HOUSE WHERE </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ4336 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        VATICA  06156  02 OF 02  301354Z </p><p>ACTION ECA-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AF-00    AID-00   CIAE-00  INL-00   DODE-00 </p><p>      SRPP-00  DS-00    EUR-00   UTED-00  VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00 </p><p>      INR-00   IO-00    L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    DCP-01   NSAE-00 </p><p>      NSCE-00  OMB-01   PA-00    PER-00   PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00 </p><p>      P-00     SCT-00   SP-00    IRM-00   SS-00    TEST-00  TRSE-00 </p><p>      T-00     USIE-00  R-00     IIP-00   PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00 </p><p>      DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /006W </p><p>                  ------------------1E1992  301354Z /38 </p><p>R 301340Z DEC 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY VATICAN </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY SARAJEVO </p><p>AMEMBASSY SKOPJE </p><p>AMEMBASSY BELGRADE </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 02 VATICAN 006156 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT.

DZOLAN TOLD US THIS IS ONE SMALL EXAMPLE OF </p><p>BOSNIA\'S TRADITIONAL TOLERANCE, BUT ONE HE HOPES WILL GROW. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  06156  02 OF 02  301354Z </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>KOSOVO: RECONCILIATION WITH THE WRONG PARTNERS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>5.  IN KOSOVO, THE DELEGATION VISITED AN EMBASSY VATICAN- </p><p>SPONSORED PROJECT FOR INTER-ETHNIC RECONCILIATION RUN BY THE </p><p>SANT\'EGIDIO COMMUNITY.  WITH A USD 60,000 GRANT FROM PD/ECA, </p><p>SANT\'EGIDIO (A LAY CATHOLIC COMMUNITY THAT FOCUSES ON </p><p>DEVELOPMENT AND RECONCILIATION IN AFRICA AND THE BALKANS) </p><p>DEVELOPED AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CURRICULUM THAT TRAINS </p><p>TEACHERS AND PROVIDES MATERIALS TO TEACH RECONCILIATION </p><p>TECHNIQUES.  THE CHILDREN STUDYING IN THE "SCHOOL OF PEACE" </p><p>AT THE PRIZREN NORMAL SCHOOL SANG AND READ THEIR OWN TEXTS, </p><p>DEMONSTRATING AN UNDERSTANDING OF HISTORICAL PHENOMENA SUCH </p><p>AS THE HOLOCAUST AND THE U.S. CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT. THE </p><p>CHILDREN CLEARLY ENJOYED EACH OTHER\'S COMPANY, OFFERING HOPE </p><p>FOR THE YOUNG GENERATION T OVERCOME THEIR PARENTS\' </p><p>HOSTILITY.  WE NOTED, HOWEVER, THE ABSENCE OF SERB CHILDREN. </p><p>PER REF EMAIL, THE NEXT STEP IN PRIZREN SHOULD BE TO </p><p>INCORPORATE SERB CHILDREN IN THE PROGRAM ALONG WITH THE </p><p>ALBANIANS, TURKS AND THE BOSNIACS CURRENTLY ENROLLED IN THE </p><p>PRIZREN NORMAL SCHOOL. </p><p> </p><p>6.
