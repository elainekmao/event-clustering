(U) The local press reported that three hundred </p><p>expatriate workers at an Abu Dhabi-based construction </p><p>company gathered at the Ministry of Labor and Social </p><p>Affairs on April 28 to protest their employer\'s </p><p>failure to pay salaries for more than three months. </p><p>The Minister of Labor Matar Humaid Al-Tayer personally </p><p>intervened asking the Workers Disputes Section to </p><p>respond to the complaint. The employer was summoned to </p><p>the Ministry and agreed to immediately pay one month\'s </p><p>salary, promising to pay the rest of the wages in </p><p>installments over a short period of time if the </p><p>workers withdrew their complaint.  The workers "asked </p><p>for time to think about it and reply to the ministry" </p><p>and selected representatives to negotiate with the </p><p>Ministry and the employer. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Comment: Work stoppages due to the failure of </p><p>employers to pay wages continue to be mediated by the </p><p>Ministry and receive significant press coverage. (See </p><p>reftels A and B).  Though the law does not technically </p><p>permit laborers to conduct work stoppages/strikes, </p><p>Ministry officials tend to react sympathetically, </p><p>particularly in cases of non-payment of wages, and </p><p>urge employees to go to the Workers Dispute Section </p><p>with their problems. While these informal mechanisms </p><p>for dispute resolution function adequately, the </p><p>government is also moving forward with legislation to </p><p>formally recognize unions and clearly define their </p><p>roles. (See reftel C). </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
