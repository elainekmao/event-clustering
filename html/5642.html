<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 000228 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FROM AMBASSADOR WILLS TO C. BORYS (IIP/G/IR), R. </p><p>WINCHESTER (IIP/G/NEA-SA) </p><p>INFO: R. MCDUFF (NEW DELHI) </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KIRC, OIIP </p><p>SUBJECT: UPGRADING POSITION, IRC DIRECTOR, COLOMBO (N721- </p><p>01), FROM FSN10 TO FSN11 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. IN NOVEMBER 2002, COLOMBO\'S IRC DIRECTOR, MS. MANORANI </p><p>"MANO" KARUNANAYAKE, RETIRED AFTER 34 YEARS OF OUTSTANDING </p><p>SERVICE TO THE MISSION.  THE DIFFICULT SEARCH FOR A </p><p>SUCCESSOR BROUGHT FORCIBLY TO OUR ATTENTION SOMETHING ON </p><p>WHICH, FRANKLY, WE SHOULD HAVE FOCUSED EARLIER:  THE </p><p>POSITION IS GRADED AT FSN10.  THIS IS A BIG MISTAKE.  WE </p><p>NEED TO CORRECT IT.  GIVEN THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS POSITION </p><p>TO OUR OBJECTIVES HERE, THE NEED TO ATTRACT THE HIGHEST </p><p>QUALITY EMPLOYEE, THE LEVEL OF ACTIVITIES AND RESOURCES </p><p>FOR WHICH THE DIRECTOR IS RESPONSIBLE, AND THE LEVEL OF </p><p>CONTACTS WITH WHOM HE/SHE REGULARLY INTERACTS, THE IRC </p><p>DIRECTOR POSITION SHOULD CARRY THE GRADE OF FSN11. </p><p> </p><p>2.  COLOMBO\'S IRC IS THE INSTITUTIONAL PUBLIC FACE OF OUR </p><p>MISSION.  IT IS OFTEN FIRST PORTAL FOR CURRENT AND FUTURE </p><p>OPINION-MAKING SRI LANKANS, AND JUST AS OFTEN WHERE THEY </p><p>RETURN FOR INFORMATION ON AMERICAN SOCIETY AND USG POLICY. </p><p>THAT IS WHY THE IRC DIRECTOR INTERACTS DAILY -- AND </p><p>FREQUENTLY SOLO -- WITH CULTURAL, COMMERCIAL, DIPLOMATIC, </p><p>GOVERNMENT, AND MEDIA CONTACTS, OFTEN AT THE HIGHEST </p><p>LEVEL.  HE/SHE ALSO PLANS, DEVELOPS, AND EXECUTES IRC </p><p>ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING ITS ACQUISITION PROCEDURES, AND ITS </p><p>PROGRAMS OF OUTREACH TO THE MISSION\'S CONTACTS AND OF </p><p>INREACH TO THE MISSION\'S OFFICERS.  THE DIRECTOR IS </p><p>RESPONSIBLE FOR IRC\'S RESEARCH FACILITIES, AMONG THE MOST </p><p>SOPHISTICATED IN SRI LANKA, SUPERVISES THE IRC STAFF, AND </p><p>MANAGES ITS BUDGET.  THROUGH THE PAO, THE DIRECTOR ADVISES </p><p>THE COUNTRY TEAM ON HOW TO USE IRC ASSETS TO FURTHER KEY </p><p>MPP GOALS. </p><p> </p><p>3. MANO REMINDED US ABOUT THE IMPACT OF VALUED EMPLOYEES </p><p>ON THE JOBS THAT THEY OCCUPY; ABOUT HOW THE BEST FSNS NOT </p><p>ONLY GROW IN THE JOB BUT GROW THE JOB ITSELF.  IN FINDING </p><p>HER REPLACEMENT, WE HAVE BECOME SADLY AWARE THAT FSN10 </p><p>REMUNERATION LEVELS WILL NEITHER ATTRACT NOR RETAIN SRI </p><p>LANKANS WITH THE EDUCATION, EXPERIENCE, AND SKILLS </p><p>REQUIRED OF THIS IMPORTANT POSITION.  SIMPLY PUT, WE </p><p>CANNOT COMPETE FOR THE TOP INDIVIDUALS WE WANT AND NEED. </p><p>WE, THEREFORE, STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT THE POSITION CARRY </p><p>THE GRADE IT DESERVES, TO WIT, THAT OF FSN11. </p><p> </p><p>4. POSITION DESCRIPTION DETAILS FOLLOW: </p><p> </p><p>5. BASIC FUNTION.  USING HIGHLY DEVELOPED EXPERTISE AND </p><p>WORKING FROM A POSITION OF SENIOR RESPONSIBILITY, THE </p><p>INFORMATION RESOURCE CENTER DIRECTOR PLANS, DEVELOPS, </p><p>ADMINISTERS, AND EVALUATES THE DIVERSIFIED PROGRAMS OF THE </p><p>IRC, THEREBY PLAYING A PIVOTAL ROLE IN THE EXECUTION OF </p><p>THE MISSION\'S PROGRAMMING ACTIVITIES. </p><p> </p><p>6.
