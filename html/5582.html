<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ANKARA 000946 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR PRM/ANE, EUR/SE AND NEA/NGA </p><p>DEPT PASS USAID FOR BHA/OFDA - WGARVELINK/RLIBBY AND FFP </p><p>EUCOM FOR JE, JR, J5, SOJ7 AND POLAD </p><p>GENEVA FOR RMA </p><p>CENTCOM FOR J3, J5 AND POLAD </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/04/2013 </p><p>TAGS: EAID, IZ, MOPS, PREF, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKISH MFA ON ACCESS FOR NGOS PROVIDING </p><p>ASSISTANCE FOR TURKEY/IRAQ, CRISIS COORDINATION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Deputy Chief of Mission Robert Deutsch for </p><p>reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Mission Disaster Relief Officer (MDRO) and Ron Libby, </p><p>USAID/OFDA, met with Feza Ozturk, MFA Head of Department for </p><p>International Political Organizations, to follow up on </p><p>assistance and coordination issues discussed during the </p><p>Humanitarian Planning Team,s meeting with MFA on January 28 </p><p>(septel).  Ozturk said that the GOT would insist on tight </p><p>coordination of NGO activities in Turkey and in contiguous </p><p>territory in northern Iraq where the Turks are prepared to </p><p>establish camps for displaced persons, but said it was </p><p>prepared to show greater flexibility and openness toward </p><p>humanitarian organizations which wanted to ship relief </p><p>articles into Iraq beyond the border zone.  Ozturk provided </p><p>additional background on humanitarian relief corridors.  He </p><p>also expressed a willingness to establish a civil-military </p><p>coordinating framework on humanitarian assistance. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NGO Access </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) In discussing access for NGOs and other humanitarian </p><p>organizations, Ozturk made a sharp distinction between </p><p>external assistance for refugee/internally displaced person </p><p>(IDP) camps on Turkish territory and contiguous territory in </p><p>northern Iraq on the one hand, and aid for the rest of Iraq </p><p>during and after a possible conflict.  With regard to the </p><p>former, Turkey would insist that NGOs sign memoranda of </p><p>understanding defining their responsibilities and that relief </p><p>efforts be centrally coordinated, as described to the HPT </p><p>delegation.  He said that the GOT would work out the mandate </p><p>to operate camps in the border zone in northern Iraq with the </p><p>Iraqi Red Crescent and the International Committee of the Red </p><p>Cross.  He added that it was not clear now how the legal </p><p>basis for a Turkish mandate in the zone would be worked out </p><p>with these other parties, as it was not a given that Turkey </p><p>would enter the area as a coalition partner.  He contended </p><p>that Turkish military authorities would have the ultimate </p><p>authority to determine which NGOs would be given access to </p><p>camps in the zone.  Ozturk said the GOT was ready to take </p><p>full responsibility for camp administration, including for </p><p>the welfare of IDPs under its authority.  He told us that, in </p><p>any event, the GOT expected few IDPs.  On centralizing </p><p>assistance through the Turkish Red Crescent (TRC), Ozturk </p><p>said that NGOs with aid destined for Turkey should donate </p><p>their supplies to TRC to avoid taxation of assistance. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) On humanitarian assistance to Iraq beyond the border </p><p>zone, Ozturk said the GOT would be far more flexible.  He </p><p>said that Turkey was prepared to allow assistance (not </p><p>well-defined, but he offered military supplies and office </p><p>equipment as examples of what would not be permitted) to be </p><p>sent across its border to Iraq, if Turkey determines that </p><p>there is a need for this assistance.  Such deliveries would </p><p>need to be approved on a case-by-case basis, but humanitarian </p><p>organizations could request pre-approval from MFA.  Ozturk </p><p>suggested that the approval process for the first </p><p>organization requesting access could take &weeks8 but that </p><p>once the bureaucratic procedure was established and the need </p><p>for help was clear, the GOT would process requests quickly. </p><p>Ozturk said aid transiting Turkey would not be taxed provided </p><p>that it was kept in bonded warehouses for no more than 90 </p><p>days (extendable) in Turkey.  MDRO and Libby pointed out </p><p>that, if NGOs were authorized in advance to pre-position </p><p>goods in Turkey for distribution in Iraq, they would procure </p><p>many if not most of the goods in Turkey rather than </p><p>elsewhere.  Libby told Ozturk that the International Rescue </p><p>Committee (IRC) is considering pre-positioning supplies and </p><p>may apply for pre-authorized access.  Ozturk asked for a list </p><p>of NGOs that the USG is working with, which we agreed to </p><p>provide.  We also suggested that MFA contact UNHCR which is </p><p>working with a large number of NGOs as well. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) MDRO raised the U.S. request to pre-position </p><p>humanitarian daily rations (HDRs), noting that the Turkish </p><p>General Staff had asked for more details on these supplies </p><p>and that we would respond soon.  Ozturk stated that it would </p><p>be better to store HDRs in Gaziantep, Turkey,s logistics </p><p>hub, rather than in Adana, which is reserved for military use. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Crisis Coordination </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Ozturk confirmed that, in addition to centers in </p><p>Ankara, the GOT would set up coordination centers in </p><p>Diyarbakir, Silopi, Van and Gaziantep.  Silopi is to be the </p><p>principal assistance hub.  Van and Gaziantep centers would be </p><p>set up if needed to receive aid from abroad.  Ozturk said </p><p>that the GOT planned to conduct an exercise in setting up a </p><p>refugee/IDP camp in Silopi on February 5. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Econoff encouraged Ozturk to consider activating a </p><p>crisis center before we are overtaken by events in Iraq, and </p><p>also asked what the GOT,s thinking is on establishing a </p><p>civilian-military coordination center to deconflict </p><p>assistance from military operations and otherwise deal with </p><p>humanitarian organizations seeking to assist needy </p><p>populations.  Ozturk replied that MFA was receptive to </p><p>setting up a civil-military coordinating mechanism with us </p><p>and looked forward to a U.S. proposal, but cautioned that the </p><p>GOT would not be ready to do this until the week of February </p><p>17.  Note:  GOT offices are closed the week of February 10 </p><p>for the Sacrifice Holiday.  End Note. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Aid Corridors </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Ozturk told us that the GOT has designated Gaziantep </p><p>and Van as the principal airports for receipt of humanitarian </p><p>assistance, but neither airport has an instrument landing </p><p>system (ILS).  For this reason, Erzurum, which does have ILS, </p><p>is designated as a backup airport. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) While Ozturk,s relative openness to allowing aid to </p><p>transit Turkey for Iraq is encouraging, it is not clear to </p><p>what extent his views will be endorsed by his superiors in </p><p>MFA or by the TGS and other interested ministries.  His </p><p>remark that it might take weeks to approve an application for </p><p>transit of relief shipments in the absence of a crisis </p><p>suggests there will be significant bureaucratic hurdles to </p><p>surmount within the GOT.  Embassy recommends testing the </p><p>system by encouraging IRC or other NGOs to apply for </p><p>permission to pre-position goods in Turkey for shipment to </p><p>Iraq in the event of a humanitarian crisis. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) On setting up a aid coordination center or framework, </p><p>Embassy believes the best approach initially would be for </p><p>MDRO, a small number of U.S. military representatives and </p><p>their GOT/TGS counterparts to begin regular bilateral </p><p>meetings on assistance in Ankara.  Until and unless the GOT </p><p>approves one or more applications for NGOs to provide </p><p>assistance across the Turkish-Iraqi border or activates its </p><p>crisis centers outside Ankara, establishing a formal center </p><p>in Diyarbakir or Silopi to coordinate such assistance and </p><p>deconflict would be of less value at this stage. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
