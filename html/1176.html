<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 THE HAGUE 001887 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR L/UNA - MATHIAS, L/NEA - BOREK, SA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, IN, PK, ICJ </p><p>SUBJECT: ICJ FINDS NO JURISDICTION OVER PAKISTAN-INDIA </p><p>AIRCRAFT SHOOTDOWN CASE </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  IN A JUDGMENT ISSUED ON JUNE 21, THE INTERNATIONAL COURT </p><p>OF JUSTICE (ICJ) DECIDED THAT THE COURT LACKED JURISDICTION </p><p>OVER A CLAIM BROUGHT BY PAKISTAN AGAINST INDIA ARISING OUT OF </p><p>THE ALLEGED DOWNING BY INDIAN FORCES OF A PAKISTANI AIRCRAFT </p><p>TRAVELING IN PAKISTANI AIRSPACE.  BY A VOTE OF 14 TO 2, THE </p><p>ICJ DISMISSED PAKISTAN\'S CLAIM.  THE COURT NEVERTHELESS </p><p>EXHORTED THE PARTIES TO RESOLVE THEIR DISPUTE BY PEACEFUL </p><p>MEANS IN ACCORDANCE WITH INTERNATIONAL LAW. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>BACKGROUND </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  ON JUNE 21, THE ICJ ISSUED ITS JUDGMENT ON THE </p><p>PRELIMINARY OBJECTIONS LODGED BY INDIA IN A CASE BROUGHT BY </p><p>PAKISTAN ON 21 SEPTEMBER 1999.  IN ITS APPLICATION, PAKISTAN </p><p>ALLEGED THAT AN UNARMED PAKISTANI NAVY AIRCRAFT, THE </p><p>"ATLANTIQUE," WHILE ENGAGED IN A ROUTINE TRAINING MISSION IN </p><p>PAKISTANI AIR SPACE, WAS SHOT DOWN BY INDIAN AIR FORCE </p><p>PLANES.  PAKISTAN ALSO ALLEGED THAT AFTER THE PLANE WAS SHOT </p><p>DOWN, INDIAN HELICOPTERS ENTERED PAKISTANI TERRITORY TO </p><p>COLLECT DEBRIS FROM THE WRECKAGE OF THE PLANE TO SUPPORT </p><p>INDIA\'S POSITION THAT THE PLANE HAD BEEN SHOT DOWN OVER </p><p>INDIAN AIR SPACE.  PAKISTAN ALLEGED THAT THE DOWNING OF THE </p><p>"ATLANTIQUE" VIOLATED THE U.N. CHARTER\'S PROHIBITION ON THE </p><p>USE OF FORCE, A BILATERAL AGREEMENT ON THE PREVENTION OF AIR </p><p>SPACE VIOLATIONS, AS WELL AS CUSTOMARY INTERNATIONAL LAW </p><p>NORMS NOT TO USE FORCE AGAINST OTHER STATES AND NOT TO </p><p>VIOLATE THE SOVEREIGNTY OF OTHER STATES. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  ON 2 NOVEMBER 1999, INDIA FILED PRELIMINARY OBJECTIONS TO </p><p>PAKISTAN\'S APPLICATION, AND ARGUED IN PARTICULAR THAT THE ICJ </p><p>LACKED JURISDICTION OVER PAKISTAN\'S CLAIM.  AFTER MEMORIALS </p><p>WERE FILED ON THE JURISDICTIONAL ISSUE, THE COURT ON APRIL </p><p>3-6 HELD A HEARING. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>JURISDICTIONAL GROUNDS </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  PAKISTAN SOUGHT TO BASE THE ICJ\'S JURISDICTION ON THREE </p><p>SEPARATE GROUNDS:  (1) THE DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISION OF </p><p>THE GENERAL ACT FOR PACIFIC SETTLEMENT OF INTERNATIONAL </p><p>DISPUTES, SIGNED AT GENEVA ON 26 SEPTEMBER 1928 ("THE 1928 </p><p>GENERAL ACT"); (2) THE "OPTIONAL CLAUSE" DECLARATIONS OF </p><p>INDIA AND PAKISTAN UNDER ARTICLE 36(2) OF THE STATUTE OF THE </p><p>ICJ; AND (3 ARTICLE 36(1) OF THE STATUTE OF THE ICJ. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>THE 1928 GENERAL ACT </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  ARTICLE 17 OF THE 1928 GENERAL ACT, TO WHICH BRITISH </p><p>INDIA ACCEDED IN 1931, PROVIDED FOR THE REFERRAL TO THE </p><p>PERMANENT COURT OF INTERNATIONAL JUSTICE, THE ICJ\'S </p><p>PREDECESSOR, OF INTERNATIONAL DISPUTES BETWEEN PARTIES OT THE </p><p>ACT.  THE PARTIES ADVANCED A VARIETY OF ARGUMENTS ABOUT </p><p>WHETHER THE 1928 GENERAL ACT REMAINS IN EFFECT, AND WHETHER </p><p>IT CONSTITUTES A TREATY UPON WHICH THE ICJ\'S JURISDICTION MAY </p><p>BE BASED.  THE ICJ DID NOT ADDRESS THESE GENERAL QUESTIONS, </p><p>BUT RATHER NOTED THAT INDIA, IN A 1974 COMMUNICATION TO THE </p><p>U.N. SECRETARY-GENERAL, ANNOUNCED THAT IT "NEVER REGARDED </p><p>(ITSELF) AS BOUND BY THE (GENERAL ACT) SINCE HER INDEPENDENCE </p><p>IN 1947, WHETHER BY SUCCESSION OR OTHERWISE.  ACCORDINGLY, </p><p>INDIA NEVER HAS BEEN AND IS NOT A PARTY TO THE GENERAL ACT </p><p>EVER SINCE HER INDEPENDENCE." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  THE ICJ RULED THAT EVEN IF INDIA COULD NOT CLAIM THAT IT </p><p>WAS NEVER SINCE INDEPENDENCE A PARTY TO THE 1928 GENERAL ACT, </p><p>THE 1974 COMMUNICATION EFFECTIVELY CONSTITUTED A DENUNCIATION </p><p>UNDER ARTICLE 45 OF THAT ACT.  AS SUCH, THE LATEST INDIA </p><p>COULD BE DEEMED TO BE A PARTY TO THE GENERAL ACT WAS AUGUST </p><p>1979, THE DATE ON WHICH SUCH A DENUNCIATION WOULD TAKE </p><p>EFFECT.  THE COURT ACCORDINGLY CONCLUDED THAT THE 1928 </p><p>GENERAL ACT COULD NOT SERVE AS A BASIS FOR THE ICJ TO </p><p>EXERCISE JURISDICTION OVER PAKISTAN\'S CLAIM AGAINST INDIA. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>ARTICLE 36(2) OPTIONAL CLAUSE DECLARATIONS </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  PAKISTAN ALSO SOUGHT TO BASE THE COURT\'S JURISDICTION </p><p>UNDER ARTICLE 36(2) OF THE ICJ STATUTE, THE SO-CALLED </p><p>"OPTIONAL CLAUSE," UNDER WHICH STATES MAY FILE DECLARATIONS </p><p>CONSENTING TO THE COURT\'S JURISDICTION OVER DISPUTES WITH ANY </p><p>OTHER COUNTRIES THAT HAVE SIMILARLY FILED OPTIONAL CLAUSE </p><p>DECLARATIONS.  INDIA OBJECTED, ON THE GROUNDS THAT IT MADE </p><p>ITS OPTIONAL CLAUSE DECLARATION SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF </p><p>RESERVATIONS PRECLUDING JURISDICTION IN CERTAIN CASES, </p><p>INCLUDING DISPUTES CONCERNING MULTILATERAL TREATIES (UNLESS </p><p>ALL PARTIES TO THE TREATY ARE ALSO PARTY TO THE ICJ CASE) AS </p><p>WELL AS DISPUTES WITH COUNTRIES WHICH ARE OR HAVE BEEN </p><p>MEMBERS OF THE "COMMONWEALTH OF NATIONS." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  THE ICJ DID NOT RULE ON THE MULTILATERAL TREATY </p><p>RESERVATION, BUT HELD THAT PAKISTAN\'S CLAIM WAS BARRED BY </p><p>INDIA\'S "COMMONWEALTH NATIONS" RESERVATION.  THE COURT </p><p>REJECTED PAKISTAN\'S CLAIM THAT PAKISTAN\'S NONACCEPTANCE OF </p><p>THE RESERVATION MADE IT "INOPPOSABLE" TO PAKISTAN.  IT ALSO </p><p>REJECTED PAKISTAN\'S SUGGESTION THAT THE "COMMONWEALTH </p><p>NATIONS" RESERVATION WAS OBSOLETE BECAUSE MEMBERS OF THE </p><p>COMMONWEALTH WERE NO LONGER UNITED BY A COMMON ALLEGIANCE TO </p><p>THE CROWN.  THE COURT REAFFIRMED THE RIGHT OF STATES TO </p><p>CONDITION THEIR CONSENT TO THE ICJ\'S JURISDICTION, AND </p><p>CONCLUDED THAT ALTHOUGH THE HISTORICAL REASONS FOR INDIA\'S </p><p>"COMMONWEALTH NATIONS" RESERVATION MAY HAVE CHANGED, THIS DID </p><p>NOT PREVAIL OVER THE INTENTION OF THE DECLARANT STATE AS </p><p>EXPRESSED IN THE RESERVATION ITSELF. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>ARTICLE 36(1) OF THE ICJ STATUTE </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  PAKISTAN ALSO ARGUED THAT THE ICJ HAD JURISDICTION OVER </p><p>THE CASE UNDER ARTICLE 36(1) OF THE ICJ STATUTE, WHICH </p><p>PROVIDES THAT THE JURISDICTION OF THE ICJ COMPRISES, AMONG </p><p>OTHER THINGS, "ALL MATTERS SPECIALLY PROVIDED FOR IN THE </p><p>CHARTER OF THE UNITED NATIONS."  THE COURT REJECTED </p><p>PAKISTAN\'S CLAIM THAT ARTICLES 1(1), 2(3), 2(4), 33, 36(3), </p><p>AND 92 OF THE U.N. CHARTER CONSTITUTED SPECIFIC PROVISIONS </p><p>CONFERRING COMPULSORY JURISDICTION ON THE ICJ. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>OBLIGATION TO SETTLE DISPUTES BY PEACEFUL MEANS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  ALTHOUGH THE ICJ FOUND THAT IT HAD NO JURISDICTION OVER </p><p>THE APPLICATION BROUGHT BY PAKISTAN AGAINST INDIA, IT NOTED </p><p>THAT THE COURT\'S LACK OF JURISDICTION DOES NOT RELIEVE THE </p><p>PARTIES OF EITHER THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO COMPLY WITH </p><p>INTERNATIONAL LAW OR THEIR LEGAL OBLIGATION TO SETTLE THEIR </p><p>DISPUTE BY PEACEFUL MEANS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>DISMISSAL BY 14 VOTES TO 2 </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  THE COURT CONCLUDED BY A VOTE OF 14 TO 2 THAT IT HAD NO </p><p>JURISDICTION OVER PAKISTAN\'S APPLICATION AGAINST INDIA. ONLY </p><p>JUDGE AL-KHASAWNEH, THE RECENTLY-ELECTED JORDANIAN JUDGE, AND </p><p>JUDGE PIRZADA, THE AD HOC JUDGE APPOINTED FOR PURPOSES OF </p><p>THIS CASE BY PAKISTAN, VOTED AGAINST THE DISMISSAL. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  BECAUSE THE COURT\'S DECISION IN THE PAKISTAN-INDIA CASES </p><p>TURNS ON THE SPECIFIC LANGUAGE OF PARTICULAR DECLARATIONS </p><p>LODGED BY INDIA, IT IS UNLIKELY TO HAVE BROAD LEGAL </p><p>CONSEQUENCES BEARING ON OTHER DISPUTES.  THE COURT DID RESIST </p><p>THE TEMPTATION, HOWEVER, TO TAKE AN EXPANSIVE VIEW OF ITS OWN </p><p>JURISDICTION THAT WOULD UNDERMINE THE ABILITY OF STATES </p><p>CAREFULLY TO LIMIT THEIR WILLINGNESS TO CONSENT TO THE </p><p>COURT\'S JURISDICTION. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13.  THE TEXT OF THE ICJ\'S JUDGMENT AND THE OPINIONS OF </p><p>JUDGES WHO WROTE SEPARATELY OR DISSENTED, AS WELL AS A PRESS </p><p>RELEASE AND LONGER SUMMARY OF THE JUDGMENT, MAY BE FOUND AT </p><p>THE ICJ\'S WEBSITE: WWW.ICJ-CIJ.ORG. </p><p>SCHNEIDER </p><p></p></div>
