(SBU) THE POLITICAL CONFLICT OVER THE ABORTED </p><p>PRIVATIZATION OF THE SUNCANI HVAR HOTEL GROUP, REPORTED REFS </p><p>A AND B, IS HAMPERING PROGRESS ON THE REST OF THE PORTFOLIO </p><p>OF THE CROATIAN PRIVATIZATION FUND (CPF) AND MORE GENERALLY </p><p>ON CROATIA\'S WHOLE ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM.  THE ANIMUS </p><p>TOWARD PRIVATIZATION THAT CONTRIBUTED IN PART TO THE SUNCANI </p><p>HVAR CRISIS, TOGETHER WITH UNREALISTIC EXPECTATIONS, IS ALSO </p><p>CASTING DOUBT ON THE VIABILITY OF THE PARTIAL PRIVATIZATION </p><p>OF 25 PERCENT PLUS ONE SHARE OF THE STATE OIL COMPANY, INA. </p><p>WITH PRIVATIZATION RECEIPTS DOWN, THIS COULD RAISE SERIOUS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00491  01 OF 04  070943Z </p><p>CONCERNS ABOUT CROATIA\'S ABILITY TO FULFILL THE CONDITIONS OF </p><p>ITS PRECAUTIONARY STAND-BY ARRANGEMENT (REF C).  ALSO IN </p><p>DOUBT IS THE GOC\'S ABILITY TO SATISFY WORLD BANK CONDITIONS </p><p>FOR ITS STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT LOAN.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>SUNCANI HVAR EPISODE CASTING LONG SHADOW </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) WHILE RUMORS THAT PERSONAL INTEREST ON THE PART OF </p><p>PROMINENT HSS (CROATIAN PEASANTS PARTY) MEMBERS PLAYED A KEY </p><p>ROLE IN THE CANCELLATION OF THE INTERNATIONAL TENDER FOR </p><p>SUNCANI HVAR ARE INTRIGUING, THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT GENERAL </p><p>SUSPICION OF PRIVATIZATION IN THE RULING COALITION -- </p><p>PARTICULARLY IN THE HSS -- ALSO PLAYED A ROLE.  HNS (CROATIAN </p><p>PEOPLES\' PARTY) PRESIDENT, VESNA PUSIC, TOLD THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>ON FEBRUARY 25 THAT, WHILE THERE WERE ERRORS IN THE </p><p>PREPARATION OF DECISION DOCUMENTS FOR THE SUNCANI HVAR </p><p>TENDER, THEY DID NOT MERIT LEVEL OF REACTION THE SALE </p><p>RECEIVED. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) WHILE MOST OF OUR GOC CONTACTS AT THE WORKING LEVEL </p><p>IN THE PRIME MINISTER\'S OFFICE AND THE MINISTRIES OF TOURISM, </p><p>ECONOMY AND FINANCE UNDERSTAND THE NECESSITY OF ATTRACTING </p><p>FOREIGN INVESTMENT, WORLD-CLASS TECHNOLOGY AND MARKETING </p><p>KNOW-HOW IN TOURISM, THE GENERAL PUBLIC THINKS THAT </p><p>PRIVATIZATION OFTEN EQUALS CORRUPTION AND THAT, IF </p><p>PRIVATIZATION MUST OCCUR, CROATIANS SHOULD BE GIVEN </p><p>PREFERENCE IN ANY TENDERS.  SALES OF COASTAL ASSETS ARE </p><p>PARTICULARLY CONTROVERSIAL.  AND SALES TO SLOVENIANS -- ABOUT </p><p>WHOM CROATS HAVE A SIZABLE CHIP ON THEIR COLLECTIVE SHOULDER </p><p>-- ARE PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT TO ACCEPT. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00491  01 OF 04  070943Z </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) A COMMISSION OF THREE MINISTERS WAS TECHNICALLY </p><p>APPOINTED TO "REVIEW" THE TENDER FOR THE SALE OF SUNCANI </p><p>HVAR.  WHEN A WEEK LATER THE COMMISSION ANNOUNCED THE </p><p>CANCELLATION OF THE SALE, NO ONE WAS SURPRISED.  THE OFFICIAL </p><p>RESOLUTION ON THE CANCELLATION CONTAINED NO EXPLANATION OF </p><p>WHY THE INTERNATIONAL TENDER WAS CANCELLED, BUT CITED SIMPLY </p><p>"OMISSIONS" OR "FAILURES."  IN A POLITICAL FLOURISH, THE </p><p>STATEMENT, SIGNED BY THE PRIME MINISTER, DISSOLVED THE </p><p>SUPERVISORY BOARD OF THE PRIVATIZATION FUND AND RELIEVED OF </p><p>THEIR DUTIES DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER SLAVKO LINIC, SDP (RULING </p><p>SOCIAL DEMOCRAT) STALWART AND PRIME PROMOTER OF </p><p>PRIVATIZATION, MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE BOZIDAR PANKRETIC </p><p>(HSS), MINISTER OF TOURISM PAVE ZUPAN RUSKOVIC </p><p>(NON-PARTISAN), MINISTER OF FINANCE CRKVENAC (SDP) AND </p><p>MINISTER OF ECONOMY JURCIC (NON-PARTISAN). </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) THE HOLLOWNESS OF THIS GESTURE IS BETRAYED BY THE </p><p>FACT THAT THE LAST PARAGRAPH OF THE RESOLUTION TASKS THE </p><p>MINISTRY OF ECONOMY -- WHOSE HEAD WAS JUST RELIEVED OF HIS </p><p>DUTIES ON THE SUPERVISORY BOARD BECAUSE OF "OMISSIONS" -- TO </p><p>DRAW UP A NEW LAW REFORMING THE PRIVATIZATION FUND. </p><p> </p><p>6.

THE CURRENT </p><p>PROPOSAL CIRCULATING EXPANDS THE SCOPE OF THE CPF\'S MANDATE </p><p>TO INCLUDE DISPOSAL OF STATE-OWNED REAL ESTATE AND TO BECOME </p><p>SOMETHING OF AN INVESTMENT AND EXPORT PROMOTION AGENCY.  THE </p><p>PLAN APPEARS TO BE A HASTILY DUSTED-OFF VERSION OF ONE </p><p>ORIGINALLY DEVELOPED UNDER EX-PRESIDENT OF THE PRIVATIZATION </p><p>FUND AND LATER MINISTER OF ECONOMY, HRVOJE VOJKOVIC.  WHILE </p><p>WE HAVE NOT FULLY EVALUATED THE PLAN, ONE IMMEDIATELY EVIDENT </p><p>FLAW IS THAT IT DUPLICATES FUNCTIONS OF EXISTING AGENCIES, </p><p>ESPECIALLY THE NEWLY-CREATED AGENCY FOR EXPORT AND INVESTMENT </p><p>PROMOTION.  THE NEW PLAN WILL REQUIRE CONSIDERABLE PERSONNEL </p><p>AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND TAKE SOME TIME TO GET UP AND </p><p>RUNNING. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) IN THE MEANTIME, WITHOUT A SUPERVISORY BOARD THE </p><p>CPF CANNOT APPROVE NEW TENDERS.  IT CAN CARRY OUT SOME </p><p>ROUTINE BUSINESS, SUCH AS SELLING ON THE STOCK EXCHANGES </p><p>PACKAGES OF MINORITY SHARES (USUALLY BOUGHT BY THE MAJORITY </p><p>SHAREHOLDERS), AND DOING THE PREPARATORY WORK FOR THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00491  02 OF 04  070944Z </p><p>TENDERING OF COMPANIES, MUCH OF IT WITH THE HELP OF USAID </p><p>CONTRACTORS.  THE GOVERNMENT IS CASTING ABOUT TO FIND SOME </p><p>WAY TO CONTINUE WITH THE MOST PRESSING ITEMS IN THE </p><p>PRIVATIZATION PORTFOLIO -- INCLUDING SELLING OFF A NUMBER OF </p><p>STATE AGRICULTURAL COMPANIES (AGROKOMBINATS) THAT ARE </p><p>BASICALLY BANKRUPT.  THE STATE DOES NOT EXPECT TO EARN MUCH </p><p>REVENUE FROM THE SALE OF THESE COMPANIES, BUT DOES HOPE THAT </p><p>THE AGROKOMBINATS WILL, IN AT LEAST SOME CASES, RECEIVE </p><p>DESPERATELY NEEDED INJECTIONS OF CAPITAL AND MANAGEMENT </p><p>KNOW-HOW. </p><p> </p><p>8.   (SBU) IF THESE COMPANIES ARE FORCED TO SHUT DOWN, </p><p>THOUSANDS OF RURAL WORKERS COULD BE LEFT WITHOUT JOBS -- </p><p>HARDLY A DESIRABLE RESULT FOR THE RURAL-BASED HSS.  IN AT </p><p>LEAST ONE CASE, THERE ARE ATTRACTIVE DOMESTIC BIDDERS WAITING </p><p>IN THE WINGS; IN ANOTHER A MANAGEMENT-EMPLOYEE BUYOUT WAS IN </p><p>THE WORKS.  THERE WAS SOME DISCUSSION OF HAVING THE CABINET </p><p>APPROVE THESE TENDERS DIRECTLY.  THE IDEA CURRENTLY BEING </p><p>FLOATED IS TO APPOINT AN INTERIM BOARD TO APPROVE A LIMITED </p><p>NUMBER OF PRIORITY TENDERS.  ONE THING IS CLEAR -- ONLY </p><p>TENDERS WITHOUT A WHIFF OF CONTROVERSY COULD BE APPROVED. </p><p> </p><p>HEADACHES FOR THE WORLD BANK </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU) IF THE AGROKOMBINATS ARE NOT PRIVATIZED, THERE WILL </p><p>BE ENORMOUS PRESSURE FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO INCREASE </p><p>SUBSIDIES.  IN WHAT IS AN ELECTION YEAR, THE GOVERNMENT MAY </p><p>CAVE.  THIS WOULD PUT PRESSURE ON THE GOVERNMENT\'S BUDGET, </p><p>PUSHING IT ABOVE ITS FIVE PERCENT OF GDP DEFICIT TARGET -- </p><p>THEREBY IMPERILING CROATIA\'S STANDBY ARRANGEMENT WITH THE IMF </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00491  02 OF 04  070944Z </p><p>AND THE DISBURSEMENT OF THE SECOND TRANCHE OF THE WORLD </p><p>BANK\'S STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT LOAN.  WORLD BANK SOURCES HERE </p><p>SUSPECT THAT THE GOVERNMENT MIGHT MISS ITS SUBSIDY REDUCTION </p><p>TARGET, BUT TOLD US THEY HOPE FOR A STRONG SHOWING ON THE </p><p>GOC\'S OTHER PRIOR ACTIONS.  THIS IS FAR FROM CERTAIN, AS THE </p><p>UNIONS GEAR UP TO OPPOSE THE DRAFT CHANGES TO THE LABOR LAW, </p><p>WHICH AS SUBMITTED TO THE PARLIAMENT, ONLY MINIMALLY MEETS </p><p>WORLD BANK CONDITIONS. </p><p> </p><p>CONCERNS ABOUT "THE BIG ONE" </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) MEANWHILE, PRIVATIZATION PROBLEMS CAST A BIG CLOUD </p><p>OVER INA, THE STATE PETROLEUM COMPANY, 25 PERCENT OF WHICH </p><p>THE GOC WOULD LIKE TO SELL OFF.  WHILE THE INA PRIVATIZATION </p><p>DOES NOT FALL UNDER THE PRIVATIZATION FUND, IT IS AT LEAST AS </p><p>POLITICAL AS THE "NON-STRATEGIC" PRIVATIZATIONS.  THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT IS KEEPING A TIGHT LID ON INFORMATION ABOUT THE </p><p>BIDS, BUT THE RUMORS ARE NOT GOOD.  WE INITIALLY HEARD THAT </p><p>THE RUSSIAN BID WAS THE BEST OF A BAD LOT, BUT WOULD REQUIRE </p><p>THE SHUTTING DOWN OF THE REFINERY IN SISAK (A DEATH KNELL FOR </p><p>THIS TOWN ALREADY STRUGGLING UNDER THE CLOSURE OF ITS </p><p>OBSOLETE STEEL MILL), AND DANGEROUS POLITICALLY.  THE RUSSIAN </p><p>BID WOULD ALSO REQUIRE THAT INA PUT UP AN EVEN GREATER AMOUNT </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ1063 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  00491  03 OF 04  070944Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AF-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00 </p><p>      COME-00  CTME-00  INL-00   DODE-00  DOTE-00  PERC-00  SRPP-00 </p><p>      EB-00    EXIM-01  E-00     FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00    FRB-00 </p><p>      H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   ITC-01   JUSE-00  LAB-01   L-00 </p><p>      VCE-00   MOFM-05  MOF-01   AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OMB-01 </p><p>      OPIC-01  ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    SSO-00   STR-00   USIE-00 </p><p>      EPAE-00  PRM-00   DRL-01   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00 </p><p>        /015W </p><p>                  ------------------40A05A  070944Z /38 </p><p>R 070931Z MAR 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 9616 </p><p>DEPT OF TREASURY WASHDC </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY ATHENS </p><p>AMEMBASSY BELGRADE </p><p>AMEMBASSY BRATISLAVA </p><p>AMEMBASSY BUCHAREST </p><p>AMEMBASSY BUDAPEST </p><p>AMEMBASSY LJUBLJANA </p><p>AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>AMEMBASSY SARAJEVO </p><p>AMEMBASSY SKOPJE </p><p>AMEMBASSY SOFIA </p><p>AMEMBASSY TIRANA </p><p>AMEMBASSY VIENNA </p><p>USEU BRUSSELS </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00491  03 OF 04  070944Z </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 04 ZAGREB 000491 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>TREASURY FOR VIMAL ATUKORALA </p><p>STATE PASS USAID E&E </p><p>ROME FOR MAUREEN GREWE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/13/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, EAID, EAGR, HR </p><p>SUBJECT: CROATIAN PRIVATIZATION HITS ROADBLOCK; </p><p>IMPLICATIONS FOR IMF, WORLD BANK PROGRAMS </p><p> </p><p>OF CAPITAL INVESTMENT.  AND THE OTHER BIDS WERE DESCRIBED AS </p><p>EVEN MORE PROBLEMATIC.  HOWEVER, THE GOVERNMENT IS </p><p>NEGOTIATING INTENSELY WITH AUSTRIA\'S OMV, AND HAS YET TO </p><p>BEGIN NEGOTIATIONS WITH HUNGARY\'S MOL.  LATELY, THE </p><p>SPIN-DOCTORS HAVE BEEN LEAKING THAT THE OMV BID IS THE </p><p>FAVORED ONE. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (SBU) UNFORTUNATELY, THE GOC HAS PROBABLY DONE A BETTER </p><p>JOB CONVINCING THE CROATIAN PUBLIC THAN THE BIDDERS THAT INA </p><p>IS A CROWN JEWEL -- CLEANING UP ITS BOOKS BY WRITING OFF </p><p>DEBT, TRUMPETING THE "RETURN TO PROFITABILITY" OF A COMPANY </p><p>THAT IS SLOWLY DETERIORATING -- AND THE RESULT WILL BE THAT </p><p>ANY RATIONAL OFFER WILL PROBABLY BE ATTACKED AS SELLING OFF </p><p>CROATIA\'S PATRIMONY FOR A SONG.  IN THE CURRENT POLITICAL </p><p>CLIMATE, THERE WILL NEED TO BE NEAR-UNANIMITY ON THE TENDER </p><p>DECISION.  WE HAVE SEEN THIS MOVIE BEFORE -- LAST YEAR THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S UNREALISTIC EXPECTATIONS CONCERNING THE PRICE </p><p>TAG FOR STATE-OWNED INSURER CROATIA OSIGURANJE SCARED AWAY </p><p>INVESTORS, INCLUDING ALLIANZ. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00491  03 OF 04  070944Z </p><p>12.  (SBU) FINDING A STRATEGIC PARTNER IS ESSENTIAL FOR INA; </p><p>WITHOUT AN INJECTION OF CAPITAL, ITS REFINERIES WILL FALL </p><p>FURTHER AND FURTHER BEHIND.  IN A FEW YEARS, IT WILL BE </p><p>UNABLE TO EXPORT TO WESTERN EUROPE BECAUSE IT WILL NOT MEET </p><p>EU QUALITY STANDARDS.  INA ALSO NEEDS THE MARKETING LINKS </p><p>THAT A GOOD PARTNER WOULD BRING.  NEVERTHELESS, THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT, WITH THE CONNIVANCE OF THE MANAGEMENT OF INA, IS </p><p>PUTTING CONDITIONS ON THE SALE -- SUCH AS RETENTION OF ALL </p><p>EMPLOYEES FOR THREE YEARS -- THAT MAKE THIS PARTIAL SALE </p><p>PROBLEMATIC. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C) IF THE INA SALE DOES NOT GO THROUGH, THE GOC\'S </p><p>PROGRAM WITH THE IMF COULD BE IN TROUBLE.  THE IMF LETTER OF </p><p>INTENT (LOI) SETS A DEADLINE OF ANNOUNCING THE RESULTS OF THE </p><p>TENDER BY THIS MONTH.  UNLESS A SWEET DEAL IS NEGOTIATED, THE </p><p>RESULT COULD BE THAT THE GOVERNMENT REJECTS ALL THE BIDS. </p><p>THE LOI GOES ON TO SAY THAT IF PRIVATIZATION REVENUES (1.2 </p><p>PERCENT OF GDP FOR THIS YEAR) FALL SHORT, THEN THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>MUST CUT SPENDING, IN ORDER TO KEEP THE DEBT LOAD FROM </p><p>RISING.  WHEN WE ASKED THE IMF REPRESENTATIVE WHETHER HE </p><p>THOUGHT THE GOC COULD MAKE ITS REVENUE TARGETS WITHOUT A </p><p>SUCCESSFUL INA PRIVATIZATION, HE THOUGHT IT UNLIKELY. </p><p>ADDITIONALLY, EVEN IF THERE ARE HIGHER THAN PROJECTED TAX </p><p>REVENUES, THINGS ARE NOT LOOKING TOO GOOD ON THE EXPENDITURE </p><p>FRONT, SINCE THE GOC\'S DOWNSIZING OF THE MINISTRY OF DEFENSE </p><p>IS BEHIND SCHEDULE AS WELL. </p><p> </p><p>A SILVER LINING </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  (SBU) A YEAR AND A HALF AGO, WHEN THE USG OFFERED </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00491  03 OF 04  070944Z </p><p>ASSISTANCE TO THE GOC FOR PUBLIC EDUCATION OF THE </p><p>PRIVATIZATION PROCESS, THE GOVERNMENT WAS RESISTANT.  A </p><p>LOW-KEY CAMPAIGN BEGAN WITH ONLY THE SUPPORT OF THE DEPUTY </p><p>PRIME MINISTER\'S OFFICE AND THE PRESIDENT OF THE CPF.  WHILE </p><p>PUBLIC OPINION POLLS SHOW LITTLE CHANGE IN ATTITUDES BY A </p><p>PUBLIC REFLEXIVELY OPPOSED TO PRIVATIZATION -- DECADES OF </p><p>SOCIALISM UNDER TITO AND YEARS OF CRONY CAPITALISM UNDER </p><p>TUDJMAN HAVE TAKEN THEIR TOLL -- ENTHUSIASM FOR THE EDUCATION </p><p>PROCESS SPREAD AMONG OTHER PARTIES OF THE RULING COALITIO,N </p><p>AND THE GOC EXPANDED THE PUBLIC EDUCATION CAMPAIGN WITH ITS </p><p>OWN FINANCIAL RESOURCES.  JOURNALISTS INCLUDED IN THE </p><p>EDUCATIONAL PROCESS WERE EXPOSED TO PRIVATIZATION-REPORTING </p><p>JOURNALISTS IN NEIGHBORING HUNGARY, AND ON THE SUNCANI HVAR </p><p>STORY, THEY DEMONSTRATED THE MOST BALANCED REPORTING IN THE </p><p>HISTORY OF CROATIAN PRIVATIZATION. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>15.
