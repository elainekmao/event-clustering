<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABU DHABI 001669 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR NEA, NEA/P FOR ACASPAR, NEA/ARP, NEA/RA, </p><p>DRL/CRA AND DRL/PHD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/06/08 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PREL, PGOV, ELAB, KEM, KSEP, TC </p><p>SUBJECT: HUMAN RIGHTS REPORT CD-ROM RECALL CREATES </p><p>MINOR CONTRETEMPS IN THE UAE </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba for </p><p>reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) SUMMARY: The recall of CD-ROMs containing a </p><p>draft Human Rights Report on the Occupied Territories </p><p>caused a flurry of activity in the UAE.  After reading </p><p>an Arabic-language newspaper article that implied </p><p>misleadingly that all negative language had been </p><p>withdrawn from the Occupied Territories\' Report, </p><p>MinInfo Shaykh Abdullah Bin Zayid called the </p><p>Ambassador on 3 April to complain about the USG\'s </p><p>actions, commenting "if this press report is true, we </p><p>might as well all throw our human rights reports in </p><p>the garbage."  After Emboffs coordinated with </p><p>Consulate Jerusalem and the Department, the Ambassador </p><p>contacted Abdullah to advise him that the "Al Khaleej" </p><p>press report was inaccurate.  She explained that a </p><p>draft version of the Human Rights Report on the </p><p>Occupied Territories had been released on CD-ROM in </p><p>error and subsequently had to be recalled.  She also </p><p>noted that the correct Occupied Territories\' Report </p><p>had been published on the Department\'s website.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) On Thursday 3 April, Minister of Information </p><p>Shaykh Abdullah Bin Zayid called the Ambassador to </p><p>register concern regarding press reports of the </p><p>Department\'s recall of CD-ROMs containing the 2002 </p><p>Country Reports on Human Rights.  Abdullah had read a </p><p>front-page article in the local Arabic-language daily </p><p>"Al Khaleej" headlined "Washington Withdraws Documents </p><p>In Which It Criticizes Israel\'s Violations," which </p><p>implied that the Department had withdrawn all negative </p><p>language from the Human Rights Report on the Occupied </p><p>Territories.  Abdullah told the Ambassador:  "If this </p><p>press report is true, we might as well all throw our </p><p>human rights reports in the garbage."  The Ambassador </p><p>undertook to respond back with full information. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) After Emboffs coordinated with Consulate </p><p>Jerusalem and the Department, the Ambassador contacted </p><p>Abdullah to advise him that the "Al Khaleej" press </p><p>report was misleading and inaccurate.  She explained </p><p>that a draft version of the Occupied Territories\' </p><p>Report had been released on CD-ROM in error and </p><p>subsequently had to be recalled.  She also noted that </p><p>the correct Human Rights Report on the Occupied </p><p>Territories had been published on the Department\'s </p><p>website. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Armed with the full AFP story -- the source of </p><p>the "Al Khaleej" article -- and the Department\'s press </p><p>guidance, PAO followed up on the matter by contacting </p><p>the "Al Khaleej" editor to protest the misleading </p><p>article.  As expected, the editor did not concede that </p><p>the published article reported less than the full </p><p>story, claiming that he had "just reported the AFP </p><p>wire story."  However, he offered to publish a </p><p>clarification to rectify the paper\'s misreporting, and </p><p>said that he would publish whatever post requested. </p><p>Post drafted a short statement and submitted it to </p><p>NEA/P, but was unable to obtain clearance in time for </p><p>publication the next day. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) The "Al Khaleej" article, which editorialized </p><p>on selected information from the AFP article, read: </p><p> </p><p>Headline:  "Washington Withdraws Documents In Which It </p><p>Criticizes Israel\'s Violations" </p><p> </p><p>Text:  "The U.S. gave a new indication of its total </p><p>bias to the entity [Israel] after it withdrew all the </p><p>CD-ROMs which contained annual US Human Rights Reports </p><p>because of what it described as a printing error which </p><p>led to \'accusing\' \'Israel\' of committing human rights </p><p>violations....The State Department announced that it </p><p>had withdrawn the CD-ROMs containing the Report after </p><p>it noticed that some Arab newspapers had published </p><p>summaries of its human rights report containing </p><p>excerpts from the rough draft of the chapter on Israel </p><p>\'not in its final form\'.  An American official said </p><p>\'this error was unintentional and there was no bad </p><p>intention in it.\'  In the version of the report on the </p><p>CD-ROMs it says that Israel\'s \'respect\' for human </p><p>rights in the Occupied Territories is still poor and </p><p>the situation worsened in many areas as \'Israel\' </p><p>continued to commit numerous serious human rights </p><p>abuses.  The final version of the report for 2002 is </p><p>found on the website of the State Department on the </p><p>Internet." </p><p>7.  (U) Interestingly, the local English-language </p><p>daily "Gulf Today," sister paper to "Al Khaleej," ran </p><p>the full AFP report in its entirety and more or less </p><p>verbatim, although under the headline "US Revises </p><p>Rights Report to Appease Israel."  The "Gulf Today" </p><p>article noted that despite changes in the language </p><p>between the draft "Israel" report on the CD-ROM and </p><p>the final and correct "Israel" report posted on the </p><p>Department\'s website, both versions of the report </p><p>catalogued a number of Israeli human rights abuses. </p><p>The article also noted that the final official report </p><p>stated that "Israel\'s overall human rights record in </p><p>the Occupied Territories remained poor, and worsened </p><p>in several areas as it continued to commit serious </p><p>human rights abuses." </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) COMMENT:  The quick media and official </p><p>reaction to the Department\'s recall of the CD-ROMs </p><p>demonstrates the political sensitivity here to USG </p><p>actions regarding Israel, which is particularly </p><p>heightened at this time because of the Iraq war and </p><p>continued violence in the territories.  Fortunately, </p><p>Abdullah had read the UAE Report and commended it to </p><p>the Ambassador, noting that he agreed with 99 % of its </p><p>contents.  The "Al Khaleej" editor\'s willingness to </p><p>engage in the current hostile media climate is </p><p>noteworthy, and Post will follow up on this matter in </p><p>a telephone interview between Deputy Secretary </p><p>Armitage and "Al-Khaleej" later this week.  Scheduled </p><p>to discuss a wide range of issues, this forum will </p><p>provide us with an excellent opportunity to reaffirm </p><p>the objectivity of the human rights reports, including </p><p>the Human Rights Report on the Occupied Territories. </p><p>END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
