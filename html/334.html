<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 ABU DHABI 00536 </p><p> </p><p>E. O. 12356:  DECL:  OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, PGOV, US, IR, TC </p><p>SUBJECT:  SULTAN:  BULLISH ON RAFSANJANI AND BEARISH </p><p>          ON ZAYED </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S - ENTIRE TEXT) </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  SHEIKH SULTAN OF SHARJAH WAS, AS USUAL, </p><p>BULLISH ABOUT RAFSANJANI\'S MODERATIONS AND CONTROL OF </p><p>EVENTS IN TEHRAN AND CLAIMED THAT THE REAL WILD CARD </p><p>WHICH RAFSANJANI FEARED WAS THE BAZARRIS, NOT THE </p><p>RADICAL CLERGY.  SULTAN SAID THAT AT UK REQUEST HE HAD </p><p>BEEN WORKING TO WIN RELEASE OF TERRY WAITE, BUT THAT </p><p>EACH TIME HE MADE PROGRESS, SOMETHING LIKE THE RUSHDIE </p><p>AFFAIR INTERVENED.  CLOSER TO HOME, SULTAN CRITICIZED </p><p>ZAYYED FOR HIS HARSH PUBLIC COMMENTS ABOUT THE UNITED </p><p>STATES AND SAID THAT HE, SULTAN, WOULD TAKE UT UP WITH </p><p>ZAYYED.  WE DOUBT THAT ZAYYED WILL BE AMUSED.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  DURING AMBASSADOR\'S INITIAL COURTESY CALL </p><p>JANUARY 23 ON SHARJAH RULER, SHEIKH SULTAN BIN </p><p>MOHAMED AL-QASSIMI, SHEIKH SULTAN REVEALED THAT HE </p><p>HAD RECENTLY MET WITH ALI SHAMS-ARDAKANI, FORMER </p><p>IRANIAN AMBASSADOR TO KUWAIT AND PRESENTLY DEPUTY </p><p>MINISTER OF MINES AND METALS.  SULTAN TOLD AMBASSADOR </p><p>AND ACCOMPANYING CONSUL GENERAL LIMBERT THAT </p><p>ARDAKANI SAID PRESIDENT HASHEMI-RAFSANJANI AND A </p><p>SMALL GROUP OF ALLIES, INCLUDING FOREIGN MINISTER </p><p>VELAYATI, DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER BESHARATI, AND </p><p>IRAN\'S AMBASSADOR TO THE UAE HADI NAJAFABADI </p><p>WERE ALL WORKING TO IMPROVE IRAN\'S RELATIONS WITH </p><p>ITS NEIGHBORS, WITH THE WEST, AND EVENTUALLY WITH THE </p><p>UNITED STATES.  ACCORDING TO SHAMS-ARDAKANI, THE </p><p>PRESIDENT WAS MOST WORRIED BY OPPOSITION FROM WITHIN </p><p>THE BAZARR.  HE KNEW FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE HOW THE </p><p>BAZARRIS COULD TIP THE BALANCE OF POWER.  MOHTASHEMI- </p><p>POUR AND HIS ALLIES IN PARLIAMENT WERE LESS WORRI- </p><p>SOME, BUT BAZARRIS HAD POWER TO DISRUPT THE IRANIAN </p><p>ECONOMY AND DISCREDIT HASHEMI\'S GOVERNMENT. </p><p> </p><p>4.  AMBASSADOR SAID THAT HOPEFUL WORDS FROM </p><p>TEHRAN HAD YET TO BE MATCHED WITH ANY HELPFUL MOVES </p><p>ON THE ISSUE OF HOSTAGES IN LEBANON.  SUCH MOVES </p><p>WERE ESSENTIAL BEFORE THE U.S. COULD CONSIDER TAKING </p><p>A MORE POSITIVE STANCE TOWARD TEHRAN.  SULTAN NOTED </p><p>THAT HE HAD TRIED ACTING AS AN INTERMEDIARY TO </p><p>ARRANGE FREEDOM OF BRITISH HOSTAGE, TERRY WAITE, BUT </p><p>EVERY TIME HE MADE ANY PROGRESS, SOMETHING SUCH AS </p><p>THE SALMAN RUSHDIE AFFAIR, WOULD FRUSTRATE HIS EFFORTS. </p><p>SULTAN FELT, HOWEVER, THAT TIME WAS AGAIN RIPE FOR </p><p>YET ANOTHER EFFORT AND IMPLIED THAT THE DEAL FOR </p><p>WAITE WHICH HE HAD BEEN DISCUSSING WOULD INVOLVE </p><p>PAYMENTS.  HE GAVE NO INDICATION THAT U.K. WAS </p><p>CONDONING PAYMENTS OR WHERE FUNDS MIGHT COME FROM. </p><p>HE WAS NOT IN DOUBT AS TO U.S. POLICY IN THIS REGARD. </p><p> </p><p>5.  SWITCHING SUBJECTS, SULTAN SAID HE THOUGHT </p><p>ZAYYED SHOULD NOT HAVE AIRED HIS FEELINGS ABOUT </p><p>THE U.S. IN PUBLIC.  IF HE HAD SUCH STRONG FEELINGS </p><p>ON THE PALESTINIAN ISSUE, HE SHOULD HAVE VOICED THEM IN </p><p>PRIVATE CHANNELS  EITHER IN WRITTEN OR ORAL COMMU- </p><p>NICATION.  AMBASSADOR REPLIED THAT PERHAPS ZAYYED\'S </p><p>REMARKS INDICATE HOW STRONGLY HE FEELS ABOUT THE </p><p>ISSUE.  NEVERTHELESS, SUCH STATEMENTS ARE NOT </p><p>HELPFUL AND DO NOT ACCURATELY REFLECT THE RELATIONSHIP. </p><p> </p><p>6. SULTAN SAID THAT HIS WIFE HAD BEEN PRESSING HIM </p><p>TO TAKE THIS QUESTION UP WITH ZAYYED.  HOWEVER, THE </p><p>STRAIN IN RELATIONS WITH ZAYYED HAD PRECLUDED CANDID </p><p>DISCUSSION.  NOW, ACCORDING TO SULTAN, RELATIONS WERE </p><p>BETTER SO HE COULD SPEAK HIS MIND. </p><p> </p><p>7.  COMMENT:  SULTAN WAS BULLISH ON RAFSANJANI\'S </p><p>PROSPECTS AND DISMISSED HIS RADICAL OPPOSITION DESPITE </p><p>TWO FAILED ATTEMPTS ON RAFSANJANI\'S LIFE.  SULTAN </p><p>HAS CONSISTENTLY OVERESTIMATED RAFSANJANI\'S CONTROL </p><p>AS WELL AS, IN OUR VIEW, HIS COMMITMENT TO MODERATION. </p><p>SULTAN SEEMED SINCERE IN HIS COMMITMENT TO HELP THE </p><p>BRITISH, OR US IF WE WANTED, ON THE HOSTAGES, BUT WE </p><p>STRONGLY SUSPECT HE OVERPLAYS HIS ACCESS AND INFLUENCE. </p><p>AS FOR HIS COMMENTS ON ZAYYED, SULTAN MAY THINK ALL IS </p><p>WELL NOW IN THEIR RELATIONSHIP, BUT IF HE STARTS </p><p>GIVING GRATUITOUS ADVICE AGAIN, WE DOUBT THAT ZAYYED </p><p>WILL TAKE KINDLY TO IT.  SULTAN MAY HAVE LITTLE CHOICE </p><p>IN THE MATTER, HOWEVER, IF, AS HE IMPLIES, HIS WIFE </p><p>IS SET ON BEARDING ZAYYED FOR HIS UNDIPLOMATIC BEHAVIOR. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>WALKER </p><p></p></div>
