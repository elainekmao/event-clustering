<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001780 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PD, AF/S, INR/R/MR </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REPORT TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS; HARARE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under headline "Ban sanction campaigners" the </p><p>      government-controlled daily "Chronicle" dedicated its </p><p>      August 5 editorial to calling on the government of Zimbabwe </p><p>      to retaliate against the "smart sanctions" imposed by the </p><p>      European Union and the United States against Robert </p><p>      Mugabe\'s administration.  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   ". . .We believe that the government, being the </p><p>      people\'s representative, should not let neo-colonialists </p><p>      have a field day dragging the good name of the country and </p><p>      its citizens in mud.  The time to act is now.  It is high </p><p>      time that the government responded to this wanton blackmail </p><p>      by first blacklisting the local champions of sanctions </p><p>      against Zimbabwe, principal among them Morgan Tsvangirai of </p><p>      the dubious opposition party, MDC (Movement for Democratic </p><p>      Change). . .If Tsvangirai et al want to continue on their </p><p>      anti-Zimbabwe crusade, they must travel on British or </p><p>      American documents because the interests that they are </p><p>      serving have nothing to do with the people of this country. </p><p>      We believe, therefore, that the first step that the </p><p>      government should take is to withdraw the privilege of </p><p>      using the Zimbabwean passport. </p><p> </p><p>      "In addition, politicians from Britain and America </p><p>      should be barred from coming into this country, as </p><p>      they only want to poison the populace.  We have in </p><p>      mind, Tony Blair, George Bush and their </p><p>      Chihuahuas. . .There is no need for the government </p><p>      to waste resources going to court when it wants to </p><p>      deport British and American spies.  It should just </p><p>      deport them in the same fashion that Zimbabweans are </p><p>      being humiliated in the hands of British and </p><p>      American immigration officials.  Why should we </p><p>      continue to treat enemies with kid gloves when it is </p><p>      clear that they want to destroy us?" </p><p> </p><p>WHITEHEAD </p><p></p></div>
