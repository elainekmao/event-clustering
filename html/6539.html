<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ADANA 0081 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINS, PGOV, PHUM, TU, IZ, ADANA, Press Summaries </p><p>SUBJECT:  SOUTHEAST TURKEY PRESS SUMMARY, </p><p>          MARCH 18, 2003 </p><p> </p><p>1. This is the Southeastern Turkey press summary </p><p>for March 18, 2003.  Please note that Turkish </p><p>press reports often contain errors or </p><p>exaggerations; AmConsulate Adana does not vouch </p><p>for the accuracy of the reports summarized here. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. FIRST IMMIGRANT WAVE TO TURKISH BORDER </p><p>(Sabah/Hurriyet/Milliyet) Migration from Kerkuk </p><p>and Mosul has begun.  During the migration </p><p>convoys of 15 to 20 kilimeters formed. </p><p>Approximately 10,000 people are heading towards </p><p>the villages of Amadiya, Sersing, Batufa and </p><p>Begova that are across from the Turkish town </p><p>Hakkari. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. RESIDENTS IN KIZILTEPE REACT </p><p> (Milli Gazete)  The residents of Kiziltepe </p><p>village reacted to Americans wanting to rent the </p><p>state hospital. A delegation of eight Americans </p><p>visited the hospital and gathered information </p><p>concerning the capacity of the hospital.  It is </p><p>reported that residents are worried that the </p><p>hospital will no longer be able to serve them in </p><p>case the hospital also serves Americans. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. U.S. ESTABLISHES SECOND BASE IN NUSAYBIN </p><p> (Milli Gazete/Evrensel/Dunya)  While preparations </p><p>continue in Mardin and Kiziltepe, the U.S. is now </p><p>preparing the Organized Industrial Zone in </p><p>Nusaybin as a second "base". It is reported that </p><p>the Zone is expected to be completed by March 23. </p><p>The zone is a very large area, the equivalent of </p><p>roughly six city blocks, and will include a </p><p>helicopter landing area.  A group of Americans </p><p>also visited the Nusaybin train station and </p><p>gathered information from officials. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.NEVRUZ PREPARATIONS </p><p> (Evrensel/Bolge/Cumhuriyet)  Nevruz preparations </p><p>continue across the country.  The DEHAP </p><p>provincial organization in Urfa held a press </p><p>conference at the Harran Hotel and announced </p><p>celebrations will take place at the local </p><p>fairgrounds.  In Tunceli, EMEP and DEHAP applied </p><p>to the governorate for permission to celebrate </p><p>Nevruz on March 21 at the town center.  Despite </p><p>the call from the Diyarbakir governorate to have </p><p>mutual celebrations, the civilian and official </p><p>activities will be held separately again this </p><p>year.  The Nevruz organization committee\'s </p><p>request to include Kurdish music in the </p><p>celebrations was turned down; consequently DEHAP, </p><p>after getting support from non-governmental </p><p>organizations, decided to have a separate </p><p>celebration in Diyarbakir. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. MARDIN WORRIED AND HELPLESS </p><p> (Evrensel) Residents in Mardin, which is filled </p><p>with U.S. soldiers, are worried and helpless. </p><p>Due to the closing of the Habur border gate, the </p><p>oil trucks are sitting idle in front of their </p><p>owners\' homes, and ever since the region has </p><p>become the site for locating U.S. bases the </p><p>economy has come to a halt.  Workers have lost </p><p>jobs, and those who are hired by American firms </p><p>to work in construction are working at minimum </p><p>wages. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  PRESS CENTER IN MARDIN </p><p> (Turkiye)  In Diyarbakir, a press center has been </p><p>established under the governorate where </p><p>journalists receive accreditation cards and </p><p>bullet proof vests.  The press center is located </p><p>at the first floor of Dedeman hotel. </p><p>8.  AMERICANS ARE WEARING BULLET PROOF VESTS </p><p>(Radikal)  The U.S. has deployed 1000 military </p><p>vehicles in Mardin, which has become the most </p><p>important logistic base for the U.S.  American </p><p>soldiers have began wearing bulletproof vests in </p><p>the past two days, which they continue to wear </p><p>during heavy work.  This is interpreted as a sign </p><p>that the possible war is close.  The number of </p><p>military vehicles that have arrived from </p><p>Iskenderun by railway to the Mardin rope factory </p><p>has increased. </p><p>HOLTZ </p><p></p></div>
