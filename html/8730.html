If Ankara does not move to solve the problem </p><p>before October, economic sanctions might be imposed on </p><p>Turkey.  Dailies regard the issue as a new source of tension </p><p>between the U.S. and Turkey, and since sanctions would also </p><p>apply to IMF and WB credits and U.S. military loans, some </p><p>even see the report as a new U.S. attempt to punish Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>U.S. Consulate Istanbul moves to new building: The new U.S. </p><p>Consulate General building in Istanbul was opened in a </p><p>ribbon-cutting ceremony attended by a large number of </p><p>guests.  Secretary Powell said in his message for the </p><p>opening that despite some difficulties, Americans and Turks </p><p>have turned to the future.  Powell expressed support for </p><p>Turkey\'s EU drive in his message. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>U.S. `inspectors\' to Turkish ports: Dailies write that the </p><p>U.S. Administration is planning to send inspectors to the </p><p>ports of a number of Muslim countries, including Turkey, to </p><p>detect chemical, biological or nuclear material.  Inspectors </p><p>will use radiation detectors and x-ray imaging equipment to </p><p>search high-risk cargo at the ports before they are sent to </p><p>the U.S. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NATO moves air operation center to Izmir: Despite objections </p><p>by Greece, NATO has decided to establish its air operation </p><p>command center in Izmir.  The command will oversee NATO\'s </p><p>southern air defense.  NATO is also planning to establish </p><p>three new training centers in Konya and Ankara by 2004. </p><p>Reports note that the move came at a time when the U.S. is </p><p>planning to close Incirlik air base. </p><p>Government seizes Uzan Group\'s energy plants: The Energy </p><p>Ministry has annulled contracts with the Uzan Group\'s </p><p>electricity companies and seized the plants owned by the </p><p>group for `ongoing violation of contract provisions.\'  The </p><p>government took over ten dams and power plants run by the </p><p>Uzan family.  Reports note that the Uzans have lost two of </p><p>their most profitable businesses, and expect similar trouble </p><p>in the sale of state-owned petrochemical giant Petkim, for </p><p>which the Uzan family entered the highest bid in a </p><p>privatization tender last Friday. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Azerbaijan uneasy about Ankara\'s meeting with Armenians: </p><p>Azerbaijan is upset about reports of secret meetings between </p><p>Turkish diplomats and Yerevan and the Armenian diaspora in </p><p>the U.S., according to "Hurriyet."  The Azerbaijani </p><p>Ambassador to Ankara blamed the Armenian lobby for pursuing </p><p>the dream of a `Greater Armenia,\' and stressed that mistakes </p><p>by Ankara could hurt Turkey\'s positive image in Azerbaijan. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>a) Middle East </p><p>b) Annual Trafficking in Persons Report </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The Roadmap Shatters" </p><p>Ali Sirmen observed in social democrat-intellectual </p><p>Cumhuriyet (6/13): "Only a week later, the roadmap has been </p><p>completely shattered.  It comes as no surprise, since the </p><p>roadmap itself was doomed to fail because of fundamental </p><p>uncertainties on both sides.  President Bush\'s priority in </p><p>the Middle East is the fight against terrorism, yet he </p><p>ignores the fact that Israel\'s occupation itself is a kind </p><p>of terror.  The roadmap also fails to comprehend the fact </p><p>that Abbas is totally incapable of taking action against </p><p>Hammas unless Israel takes some serious steps first.  . </p><p>Sharon\'s power stems from his acts of retaliation, which </p><p>only serve the cause of war, not peace.  Sharon\'s policy is </p><p>making Hammas even stronger than before. . It remains a far- </p><p>fetched idea to produce peace in the Middle East, as the </p><p>implementation of the roadmap and the foundation of a </p><p>Palestinian state by 2005 seem very unlikely." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"US threatens Turkey with economic sanctions" </p><p>Zeynep Gurcanli evaluated the Annual Trafficking in Persons </p><p>Report in the tabloid Star (6/13): "Quite unexpectedly, </p><p>Turkey is facing another critical development in its </p><p>relations with the US.  The US is on the verge of imposing </p><p>economic sanctions against Turkey, and it has nothing to do </p><p>with the rejection of the troop deployment decree by the </p><p>Turkish parliament during the Iraq crisis. . According to US </p><p>law, unless Turkey takes some concrete steps to counter </p><p>human trafficking within 90 days, sanctions will be </p><p>implemented automatically. . If Ankara does not take the </p><p>proper steps in a timely fashion, there is one more way for </p><p>salvation: President Bush could intervene to stop the </p><p>sanctions being imposed.  This would have to be justified on </p><p>the grounds of US national interests.  On this issue, the </p><p>`decree crisis\' could come back to the agenda whether we </p><p>like it or not.  President Bush is in a mood to `punish\' or </p><p>at least `pressure\' Turkey because of the failure on troop </p><p>deployments.  In the current atmosphere, it seems very </p><p>unlikely that he would to stop the sanctions from being </p><p>implemented." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
