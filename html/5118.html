<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 GUATEMALA 000102 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/14/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MOPS, PINR, MASS, PGOV, SNAR, PHUM, GT </p><p>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR DISCUSSES MILITARY-TO-MIILTARY </p><p>RELATIONSHIP WITH MOD </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DATT COL RICHARD NAZARIO FOR REASON 1.5 (A) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p> 1.  (C) Summary: During an introductory call on MOD Robin </p><p>Moran, the Ambassador restated USG policy in dealing with the </p><p>Guatemalan military and reviewed the benchmarks for possibly </p><p>establishing normal military-to-military relations.  The </p><p>Ambassador said that the military needs to improve its human </p><p>rights performance, especially its cooperation with other </p><p>agencies, show positive results in curtailing illegal </p><p>activities, and increase transparency in the military budget. </p><p> The MOD acknowledged the problems in the bilateral </p><p>relationship and agreed that more needs to be done.  End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) On 9 January, 2003, Ambassador Hamilton paid an </p><p>introductory call on Minister of Defense, Major General Robin </p><p>Moran  The meeting took place at the MOD\'s office; the </p><p>Ambassador was accompanied by DATT and the MILGROUP Commander. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) The Ambassador began by telling the MOD frankly that </p><p>the Guatemalan military continues to have a negative image in </p><p>the USG, based largely on the human rights abuses committed </p><p>during the internal conflict, the lack of cooperation in </p><p>ongoing investigations into these atrocities, and deeply </p><p>ingrained corruption.  The Ambassador noted that there is a </p><p>perception that, in the last couple of years, the military </p><p>has moved backwards in terms of human rights protection and </p><p>budget transparency.  As a result, the current USG </p><p>restrictions, which prevent normal military-to-military </p><p>relations in terms of training, FMF and other military </p><p>assistance, will remain in place.  When the Guatemalan </p><p>military shows significant progress and complies with the six </p><p>benchmarks (see para 11) that we have previously discussed, </p><p>the U.S. Executive would be prepared to advocate lifting the </p><p>restrictions with the Congress. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) The Ambassador noted that one of his personal goals </p><p>while in Guatemala is to see Guatemalan military performance </p><p>improve to such an extent that compelling arguments could be </p><p>made for restoring a full military-to-military relationship. </p><p>He said that it is up to the Guatemalan military, however, to </p><p>show that they have reformed to such an extent as to merit a </p><p>restored relationship. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) The Ambassador told the MOD that there is a high </p><p>probability that Guatemala will be decertified based on poor </p><p>counter-narcotics cooperation, and that this would affect </p><p>other areas of the bilateral relationship.  The Ambassador </p><p>noted that recertification could be possible, even in the </p><p>current year, but would take a determined effort by the </p><p>government to deal effectively with this problem.  The </p><p>Ambassador said to the MOD that it is imperative that the </p><p>military redirect its priorities and resources, and increase </p><p>cooperation with other government agencies to combat drug </p><p>trafficking together and show positive results.  The </p><p>Ambassador also told the MOD that the military needs to </p><p>cashier corrupt officers and eliminate the influence that </p><p>some retired military officers have over military matters </p><p>such as promotions, assignments and operations.  He also </p><p>mentioned the imperative to do all possible to put an end to </p><p>threats against the Guatemalan human rights community. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) An apparently sincere MOD thanked the Ambassador for </p><p>his frankness and his candid observations regarding the </p><p>weaknesses of the military.  The MOD said that these types of </p><p>criticism have provided him with ammunition he needed to </p><p>fight corruption and eliminate "bad apples."  The MOD </p><p>explained that he had used recent declarations made by US </p><p>officials about parallel forces and corruption to get </p><p>authorization from President Portillo to remove from active </p><p>duty several senior officers allegedly involved in </p><p>corruption. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) The MOD described other initiatives that the military </p><p>is taking to professionalize the institution, such as a major </p><p>restructuring that will involve the reduction of </p><p>approximately 6,000 members of the Armed Forces and the </p><p>closure of several military installations around the country. </p><p> This restructuring will save money in salaries and overhead </p><p>maintenance of the installations.  The money saved could be </p><p>used to improve quality of life, training and equipment.  The </p><p>MOD said that the personnel reduction involves approximately </p><p>1,000 officers and 5,000 enlisted personnel and specialists. </p><p>The MOD noted that he was promised a budget allocation by </p><p>April to compensate officers and specialists for their </p><p>services and to contribute to their retirement pensions.  In </p><p>response to the Ambassador\'s question about how these </p><p>officers will be selected for retirement, the MOD said that </p><p>an honor selection board will be formed to review each </p><p>officer\'s record and standard of living.  Those officers with </p><p>a record of bad performance or who cannot justify their </p><p>standard of living based on their salaries or other </p><p>legitimate income will be removed first. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) The MOD tried to justify the need for secrecy of the </p><p>military budget in order to be able to protect the country, </p><p>and the lack of more active participation by the military in </p><p>anti-narcotics operations based on scarce resources.  The </p><p>Ambassador responded that there are several ways to justify </p><p>the military expenditures and budget to their Congress while </p><p>maintaining legitimate state secrets.  In regard to the lack </p><p>of resources, the Ambassador suggested that the military </p><p>needs to be more aggressive in working with the judicial </p><p>system and other government institutions to find ways to use </p><p>seized assets from anti-narcotics operations, such as boats </p><p>and airplanes, against illegal traffickers. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) The MOD stated to the Ambassador that on December 31, </p><p>2002, he traveled to Mexico accompanied by the Minister of </p><p>Government to meet with their counterparts in order to </p><p>increase regional cooperation in the fight against narcotics </p><p>traffickers.  The MOD stated that the pledge for cooperation </p><p>between both countries was put to the test immediately upon </p><p>his return when the Mexican Navy was allowed to enter </p><p>Guatemalan waters in pursuit of narco-traffickers, and </p><p>captured two go-fast boats and over 2,200 kilos of cocaine. </p><p>The MOD said that he needs more resources and intelligence </p><p>cooperation to be able to be more responsive to these types </p><p>of operations.  The Ambassador stated that based on current </p><p>restrictions, the Guatemalan military should not count on any </p><p>US material assistance other than advice and intelligence </p><p>cooperation, but instead the military should seek increased </p><p>regional cooperation and reprioritize use of their current </p><p>resources. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Comment: The Minister of Defense clearly values the </p><p>relationship with the USG, and was open in acknowledging the </p><p>problems that have kept the bilateral military-to-military </p><p>relationship at a low in recent years.  While anxious to work </p><p>with us to improve the relationship, particularly in reducing </p><p>the influence of former military officers and in increasing </p><p>military cooperation against transnational criminal threats, </p><p>Moran did not suggest that the GOG is moving to address the </p><p>specific benchmarks for restoring IMET and FMF.  We will </p><p>continue to use his interest in a better relationship with us </p><p>to seek concrete action on the benchmarks during the coming </p><p>months. </p><p> </p><p>11. (C)  In the interest of comprehensiveness, the six </p><p>benchmarks are: </p><p>--  Military cooperation with investigation into human rights </p><p>abuses committed during the internal conflict; </p><p>--  Disbandment of the EMP; </p><p>--  Removal of certain key officers implicated in corrupt </p><p>activities, human rights offenses, or organized crime; </p><p>--  Full military cooperation and intelligence sharing with </p><p>the USG against narcotics, alien smuggling and terrorism; </p><p>--  Cooperation of the military (D-2) with civilian </p><p>authorities to identify individuals and groups harassing </p><p>human rights workers and provide intelligence; </p><p>--  Military recognition of congressional (civilian) </p><p>oversight of their budget. </p><p>Hamilton </p><p></p></div>
