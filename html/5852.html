<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 001131 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, P, EUR AND EB </p><p>TREASURY FOR U/S TAYLOR </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/02/2006 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY\'S ECONOMY: BUDGET IMPASSE WITH IMF </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Econ Counselor Scot Marciel for reasons 1.5 </p><p>(b,d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary:  Market analysts predict the market\'s current </p><p>positive sentiment will reverse quickly by Monday, in the </p><p>absence of news of a deal on U.S. troop deployments. </p><p>Meanwhile, the GOT has reached an impasse with the IMF staff </p><p>over the 2003 primary budget surplus - the IMF staff see a </p><p>$3.4 billion shortfall towards the 6.5 percent of GNP target. </p><p> The GOT is not offering to undertake any new fiscal measures </p><p>in their talks with the IMF, per resrep.  One senior </p><p>MinFinance contact told us he is concerned that the GOT will </p><p>submit the budget to the parliament without IMF approval. </p><p>Deputy PM Sener\'s surprise announcement February 19 of a new </p><p>draft bill - to guarantee government jobs to all workers in </p><p>privatized enterprises - sparked another IMF protest letter. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Markets Positive for Now </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  On February 20 Turkish financial markets remained </p><p>positive, believing in a scenario of several more days of </p><p>tough bargaining between the U.S. and Turkey before the two </p><p>sides strike a deal on a U.S. troop deployment.  However, </p><p>market analysts such as Cem Akyurek, chief economist for </p><p>Global Securities (Turkey\'s largest stock brokerage) tell us </p><p>markets expect positive news by Monday. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--   The lira depreciated slightly to TL 1,633,000 to the </p><p>dollar (from TL 1,626,000); T-bills were stable at 56.5 </p><p>percent compounded; the Istanbul Stock Exchange closed up 0.5 </p><p>percent in continued heaving trading. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2003 Budget Impasse </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Both Ministry of Finance and IMF staff sources tell </p><p>us the two sides have reached an impasse on the primary </p><p>surplus target:  the GOT believes their draft 2003 budget </p><p>exceeds 6.5 percent of GNP; while IMF staff calculate the </p><p>measures in the draft budget which are acceptable to them as </p><p>yielding only about 4.8 percent of GNP.  This 1.67 percent of </p><p>GNP difference amounts to TL 5.9 quadrillion or $3.4 billion. </p><p> Ahmet Kesik, MinFinance Deputy DG for the budget, told us </p><p>the gap could largely be closed if IMF accepted two GOT </p><p>positions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  First, the GOT has proposed postponing the 2003 "Direct </p><p>Income Support" payments for poor farmers into 2004 (nearly </p><p>$1 billion).  IMF staff, bolstered by the World Bank, cannot </p><p>accept what they see as reversing a key agricultural reform, </p><p>while the GOT engages in new agricultural spending under the </p><p>price support system (e.g., on hazelnuts and tobacco). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Second, the GOT wants to exclude from the definition of </p><p>primary surplus "foreign in-kind contributions" (amounting to </p><p>$1.5 billion, these are goods - including military equipment </p><p>- imported by the line ministries using long-term foreign </p><p>export agency credits rather than cash).  IMF staff want </p><p>these purchases included as primary spending (and in fact </p><p>Kesik agrees that this would be an effective way of limiting </p><p>ministries\' ability to import such goods). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  IMF staff see the $3.4 billion primary surplus gap as </p><p>largely related to their more realistic assessment of the </p><p>GOT\'s fiscal measures.  For instance, the GOT claims its tax </p><p>amnesty will result in TL 2.4 quadrillion ($1.4 billion) in </p><p>revenue, based on a 75 percent participation rate by </p><p>delinquent taxpayers.  But IMF experience indicates a much </p><p>lower participation rate, resulting in likely revenue closer </p><p>to TL 0.7 quad ($400 million).  IMF staff have asked MinState </p><p>Babacan and MinFinance Unakitan to adopt more of the fiscal </p><p>measures proposed by IMF staff in order to close the gap, </p><p>which they have refused to do. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Kesik, the GOT\'s main budget expenditure expert, told </p><p>us in confidence he is concerned that the GOT may decide to </p><p>submit the 2003 budget to the parliament without IMF </p><p>approval.  Kesik said his contacts with Finance Minister </p><p>Unakitan "scare" him.  "These guys just don\'t understand the </p><p>issues."  (Note:  Kesik is a strictly observant Muslim from </p><p>the AK stronghold of Konya.  Unlike some other senior </p><p>bureaucrats, he has no ideological problems with AK.  His </p><p>problem is he thinks they\'re incompetent.)  MinFinance </p><p>Unakitan told the press late February 20 that the GOT would </p><p>send the 2003 budget to the parliament "shortly, probably </p><p>next week." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Budget Note: One of Kesik\'s constant themes is the </p><p>need for social security reform.  In the late 1980\'s, when he </p><p>started at the Finance Ministry, the state\'s social security </p><p>funds were self-financing.  Now the central government budget </p><p>includes an annual appropriation of TL 16 quadrillion (nearly </p><p>$10 billion) to keep these pension funds solvent.  The chief </p><p>villain, per Kesik, is former President Demirel, who lowered </p><p>the civil service retirement age to 39.  This was the first </p><p>step in bankrupting the social security system in Turkey, per </p><p>Kesik.  End Note. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A Negative Surprise On Privatization </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Following the February 19 Cabinet meeting, Deputy PM </p><p>Sener announced that the GOT had agreed to submit to </p><p>parliament a "privatization job law."  The law would </p><p>guarantee continued public sector employment for state </p><p>enterprise workers who lose their jobs through privatization. </p><p> The daily Milliyet estimates that the law could establish as </p><p>many as 70,000 new civil service positions (there are </p><p>currently 62,000 unionized workers and 10,000 civil servants </p><p>in the SEEs scheduled for privatization).  Sener said the </p><p>following: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  "In a country with a serious unemployment problem like </p><p>Turkey, a privatization program that ignores the need to </p><p>provide jobs to those who lose them through privatization is </p><p>unacceptable." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  "The core of the new law provides that workers who are </p><p>likely to lose their jobs can apply for a new civil servant </p><p>position within three months, and can continue to work for </p><p>the government." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) IMF resrep told us February 20 that IMF mission </p><p>chief sent a written note to Treasury U/S Oztrak that the new </p><p>law, which came as a surprise to the IMF mission, was </p><p>"unacceptable." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU)  Comment:  Sener has a point about the unemployment </p><p>problems of privatization.  The solution is to work with the </p><p>World Bank, which has offered the GOT loan programs to </p><p>support severance payments and job retraining for privatized </p><p>SEE workers.  Instead, Privatization Administration officials </p><p>have complained to us that the World Bank\'s conditions make </p><p>these loan programs unworkable.  Now the GOT is taking the </p><p>counter-productive path of keeping everyone in the public </p><p>sector, reducing much of the potential efficiency gains of </p><p>privatization. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
