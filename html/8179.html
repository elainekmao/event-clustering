<p>UNCLAS AMMAN 002959 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: AORC, KUNR, PREL, JO, UN, WHO </p><p>SUBJECT: WHO SCALE OF ASSESSMENTS: JORDANIAN HEALTH </p><p>MINISTER ALREADY IN GENEVA </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 131497 </p><p> </p><p> 1. (U) On May 18, A/Polcouns conveyed reftel points on the </p><p>WHO scale of assessments issue to Ambassador Musa Burayzat, </p><p>the Director of the MFA\'s IO Department, and requested </p><p>Jordan\'s support of the U.S. position at the WHA in Geneva. </p><p>Separately, econoff passed the same material to the Jordanian </p><p>Ministry of Health. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) On May 20, A/Polcouns followed up with Burayzat who </p><p>said that Jordan\'s head of delegation to the WHA, Minister of </p><p>Health Dr. Walid Ma\'ani, had already departed Amman for </p><p>Geneva.  The MFA had passed our points on to him there and </p><p>Burayzat encouraged the U.S. delegation to contact Ma\'ani </p><p>directly about this issue.  Burayzat noted that while the GOJ </p><p>as a rule seeks to support U.S. positions, any increase in </p><p>Jordan\'s WHA assessment would have budgetary implications and </p><p>would have to be reviewed by its Ministry of Finance. </p><p>A/Polcouns pointed out that the issue at hand is not a change </p><p>in the scale of assessments -- that had already been adopted </p><p>by member states in 2001 -- but rather possible continuation </p><p>of mediation.  Burayzat noted the distinction but </p><p>nevertheless the MFA, after hearing Health Minister Ma\'ani\'s </p><p>views on the subject, would have to consult with Finance </p><p>before making a decision. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
