<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 008532 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/21/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PINS, PINR, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: BEHIND THE MAN: THE FAMILY OF NEW TURKISH PM </p><p>ABDULLAH GUL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 8358 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(C) Classified by Acting Political Counselor Nicholas Kass. </p><p>Reason: 1.5 (b)(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary and comment: Turkish Prime Minister Abdullah </p><p>Gul (reftel), Number Two man in the Islam-influenced AK </p><p>(Justice and Development) Party of R. Tayyip Erdogan, is a </p><p>democrat and political reformist who nonetheless heads a </p><p>family that takes Islam seriously and reflects his own moral </p><p>proclivities.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Gul\'s wife Hayrunnisa and three children share and </p><p>reflect the PM\'s strong Muslim faith.  The 40ish Mrs. Gul </p><p>wears the Islamic headscarf (note: as do approximately half </p><p>of the wives of the AK Government ministers.  End comment.) </p><p>Married young (before the age of 16), Hayrunnisa Gul could be </p><p>considered by many elite Turks as a stereotypical covered </p><p>Muslim wife.  Yet she has a noticeable if demure presence of </p><p>her own, reflected in her conservative yet stylish attire, </p><p>opulent yet tasteful jewelry -- and her steely determination </p><p>to challenge Kemalist propriety.  She has a case pending </p><p>against the Turkish State in the European Court of Human </p><p>Rights for denying her matriculation at Ankara University </p><p>Faculty of Letters for wearing the headscarf; she had passed </p><p>the admissions test (which, in more traditionalist fashion, </p><p>she took after her children were grown) with flying colors. </p><p>A similar case was scheduled for the ECHR Nov. 19, which </p><p>could serve as a precedent. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- The soft-spoken Hayrunnisa presents herself as a woman </p><p>more concerned with her family than her husband\'s political </p><p>ambitions.  Privately to poloff, Hayrunnisa has been quick to </p><p>point out that her husband is the politician in the family. </p><p>She nevertheless also staunchly defends her political </p><p>affiliation, her country, her religion, and her right -- </p><p>attenuated, in her view, by the Turkish State\'s outmoded and </p><p>overly harsh understanding of secularism -- to practice her </p><p>religion. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- The Gul\'s daughter, Kubra, 19, is herself engaged on the </p><p>headscarf front as a student at Ankara\'s Bilkent University, </p><p>where English is the language of instruction.  Though Bilkent </p><p>is known for its more open and dynamic approach to education </p><p>-- particularly when compared to bastions of Kemalism such as </p><p>Ankara University -- Kubra Gul explained to poloff that she </p><p>adheres to Muslim tradition by covering her head with a wig </p><p>when in class -- thereby avoiding the risk of a head-on </p><p>confrontation with GOT enforcers of Kemalist principles and </p><p>being banned from classes (and we expect, embroiling her </p><p>father in controversy).  According to a senior AK official, </p><p>preliminary negotiations are underway to arrange a marriage </p><p>between Kubra Gul and one of Tayyip Erdogan\'s sons. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Abdullah Gul is widely regarded even by many Kemalist </p><p>secularists as an engaging, tolerant man, though one with </p><p>deep convictions.  These traits, and the evident importance </p><p>of Islam to the Gul family, reflect a cardinal Ozalist virtue </p><p>that is a key to success in Turkish politics, and to Turkish </p><p>social peace: to be at once both modern and forward looking, </p><p>yet with an abiding respect for the religious and traditional </p><p>values. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
