<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 06 RANGOON 000031 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP, INL, AND DRL </p><p>USCINCPAC FOR FPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/06/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PINS, SNAR, PHUM, PREL, MOPS, BM, Ethnics, Human Rights </p><p>SUBJECT: END GAME IN BURMA\'S ETHNIC WARS </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: COM Carmen Martinez.  Reason: 1.5 (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: Burma has basically won its ethnic wars. </p><p>While some small-scale operations continue, the situation now </p><p>is nothing like it was in the late 1980s.  Then, 20 separate </p><p>insurgent groups could put more than 60,000 troops in the </p><p>field in Burma.  Now, the five or six groups that remain </p><p>active can muster at most 5,000 troops.  All, moreover, have </p><p>been reduced to guerrilla operations; none are any longer </p><p>capable of holding territory in Burma. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Behind these developments lie an integrated GOB </p><p>political, military, economic, and diplomatic strategy that, </p><p>in many ways, was the exact opposite of Ne Win\'s approach. </p><p>Led by Secretary 1 Khin Nyunt, the GOB has mixed political </p><p>negotiations with military force, economic inducements, and </p><p>diplomatic initiatives to isolate, defeat, co-opt, and slowly </p><p>re-integrate its armed opponents within the Burmese Union. </p><p>The entire 14-year campaign is an excellent example of the </p><p>political skills the SPDC can display when issues of high </p><p>interest to them are at stake. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Problems remain, however.  It is still not clear how </p><p>the government plans to integrate these former insurgent </p><p>groups and their special regions into an enduring </p><p>constitutional order.  International appreciation of the </p><p>government\'s victory has also been strictly limited. </p><p>Regional states like China, India, and Thailand have accepted </p><p>the GOB\'s victory.  In the West, however, the view is </p><p>decidedly more negative.  While some Western governments have </p><p>welcomed the re-establishment of order in areas previously </p><p>governed by criminal elements, for most, the allegations of </p><p>human rights abuses that accompanied the GOB\'s campaign have </p><p>only solidified their view of the GOB as a brutal </p><p>dictatorship.  Finally, but perhaps most seriously, there is </p><p>no guarantee that the government\'s work will last.  For </p><p>whatever success the GOB has had in ending the ethnic wars </p><p>and reconstructing the Union of Burma, it has failed </p><p>miserably as a government -- to the point of never even </p><p>laying a secure fiscal basis for continued rule.  If that is </p><p>not corrected, then all of the GOB\'s work in reconstructing </p><p>the Union, through war, diplomacy, and political </p><p>negotiations, could well be washed away.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) For all intents and purposes, the GOB has won its </p><p>ethnic wars.  While low intensity operations continue on both </p><p>the eastern and western borders, the situation now is nowhere </p><p>near what it was when the State Law and Order Restoration </p><p>Council (SLORC) seized power in 1988.  Then, the GOB was </p><p>faced with over 20 active insurgent groups capable of putting </p><p>a combined total of over 60,000 soldiers in the field.  The </p><p>Kachin Independence Organization controlled the largest </p><p>portion of Kachin State; the Burmese Communist Party held </p><p>most of northern Shan State east of the Salween river; Khun </p><p>Sa\'s Mong Tai Army was ensconced in southern and western Shan </p><p>State; and the Karen National Union held broad swathes of </p><p>Karen State.  Now, virtually none of this remains.  The only </p><p>armed opposition still in the field -- the Karen National </p><p>Union (KNU), the Karenni National Progressive Party (KNPP), </p><p>the Shan State Army (South), the Chin National Front (CNF), </p><p>and the Arakan Rohingya National Organization (ARNO) -- taken </p><p>altogether, can perhaps put 5,000 troops in the field.  All, </p><p>moreover, have largely been reduced to guerrilla operations. </p><p>None are capable any longer of holding territory in Burma. </p><p> </p><p>National Defense and Counter-insurgency Strategy </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Behind this change lies an integrated GOB political, </p><p>military, and economic strategy that has matured as the GOB </p><p>has moved away from the simple-minded defense strategies of </p><p>the Ne Win and U Nu years.  Ne Win basically believed that </p><p>the greatest threats to Burma would arise from its nearest </p><p>neighbors (China, India, and Thailand) and that its greatest </p><p>strength lay in its natural defenses -- the mountains and </p><p>forests that surround the Burman heartland.  Burma, he </p><p>believed, could rely on natural obstacles to hold up any </p><p>attacker and on a lightly armed people\'s army to cut the </p><p>enemy to pieces in the forests.  It became, as a consequence, </p><p>policy under both the U Nu and Ne Win governments to leave </p><p>the wilderness areas intact -- in effect, to sacrifice the </p><p>development of those border areas to Burma\'s national defense </p><p>priorities. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) That approach, however, had disastrous side-effects, </p><p>providing both the motive and the opportunity for ethnic </p><p>rebellions.  It antagonized the ethnic inhabitants of the </p><p>outlying regions, who found themselves cut off from any hope </p><p>of development.  It also limited the government\'s writ in </p><p>those areas, as the wilderness that the Burmese created </p><p>proved equally impenetrable from the Burmese side.  The </p><p>Burmese Army could mount dry season sweeps through these </p><p>regions, but it could not maintain a presence in the face of </p><p>popular resistance.  As a result, the GOB rapidly found </p><p>itself surrounded not by buffers to invasion, but by </p><p>safe-havens from which bandits and insurgents could operate </p><p>with impunity.  Law and order broke down and ethnic </p><p>insurgencies spread to the point where, by the mid-1980s, </p><p>virtually all of Burma\'s inland borders were in the hands of </p><p>insurgents. </p><p> </p><p>The Turning Point </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Fortunately for the government, the insurgents had </p><p>their own problems.  Factionalism was rife and foreign </p><p>support uncertain.  China, in particular, backed off from </p><p>support of the Burmese Communist Party (BCP) after the rise </p><p>of Deng Xiao Ping in the late 1970s.  Thailand, similarly, </p><p>swung back and forth between support for ethnic rights in </p><p>Burma and concern about the refugee, crime, and public health </p><p>problems generated by the insurgencies in Burma.  As a </p><p>result, neither the GOB nor the insurgents could gain the </p><p>upper hand until events brought in new leadership, both in </p><p>Rangoon and among the major insurgents during the late 1980s. </p><p> In Rangoon, the military established a new military council </p><p>(the State Law and Order Restoration Council) in place of Ne </p><p>Win\'s failed dictatorship.  Six months later (in March and </p><p>April 1989) a series of mutinies tore the BCP into a set of </p><p>smaller ethnic armies whose first priority was not national </p><p>revolution, but peace and development for their own regions. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Recognizing the opportunity (and the necessity for </p><p>change), the GOB, led by Secretary 1 Khin Nyunt, basically </p><p>turned government policy on its head.  Within months, the GOB </p><p>negotiated  political agreements with four factions of the </p><p>BCP -- the Kokang Chinese under Peng Kya Shin, the Wa under </p><p>Kyauk Ni Lai and Pauk Yu Chan, the Shan, Akha, and Lahu under </p><p>Sai Lin, and the BCP\'s Kachin under Ting Ling.  Active </p><p>hostilities were brought to a close, while the former </p><p>insurgents were allowed to keep their arms and to administer </p><p>the territories they occupied.  Khin Nyunt described the </p><p>approach as giving the ethnic groups what they wanted -- </p><p>peace and an opportunity for development.  The final </p><p>agreements, however, also solidified splits among the ethnic </p><p>factions and helped ensure that the GOB would never again </p><p>have to face the combined strength of the BCP in the field. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Over the next half-decade, the GOB offered the same </p><p>basic political deal to all other insurgent groups.  It also </p><p>added military, economic, and diplomatic elements to its </p><p>strategy.  On the military side, the Burmese Army ditched the </p><p>idea of fighting a "people\'s war" -- a doctrine which had </p><p>kept its own lightly armed forces on a par with the </p><p>insurgents -- and began to add manpower, heavy weapons, and a </p><p>logistic tail that would allow it to sustain operations </p><p>year-round in insurgent areas.  It also concentrated against </p><p>the most recalcitrant groups -- the KNU and Khun Sa\'s Mong </p><p>Tai Army -- eventually forcing the Mong Tai Army into </p><p>surrender and the KNU out of Burma entirely.  On the economic </p><p>side, it sweetened the deal.  Originally, the GOB offered the </p><p>former insurgents only control of the economic resources </p><p>within the territories they administered.  Basically, this </p><p>amounted to border trade, logging and mineral rights, and the </p><p>illicit traffic in narcotics.  Beginning in 1990, however, </p><p>the GOB added a borderlands development program, which has </p><p>since contributed more than 20 billion kyat (according to </p><p>government figures) to development in areas controlled by the </p><p>former insurgents.  It also passed out mineral rights within </p><p>Burma proper and opened up the Burmese economy to investments </p><p>by the insurgent groups, allowing the Wa, for instance, to </p><p>make investments in banks, airlines, plantations, ranches, </p><p>and factories throughout Burma.  While this has been </p><p>controversial, with many Burmese accusing the government of </p><p>selling off the economy\'s crown jewels to criminal elements, </p><p>it has also given the former insurgents a stake in the Union </p><p>and opened development opportunities for them that go beyond </p><p>crime. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) This promise of peace, development, and self-rule, </p><p>when combined with the threat of increased military action </p><p>and the lure of economic benefits, proved irresistible to </p><p>most insurgent groups.  Between 1990 and 1995, seventeen </p><p>separate groups reached agreements with the government, </p><p>including the Kachin Independence Organization, the Kayan New </p><p>Land Party, the New Mon State Party, the Pa\'O National </p><p>Organization, the Palaung State Liberation Party, and a </p><p>variety of other smaller groups.  One year later, the Mong </p><p>Tai Army surrendered, leaving the KNU as the only significant </p><p>insurgent group still in the field.  Even the KNU, however, </p><p>was only a shadow of its former self.  Split into two rival </p><p>religious factions (the KNU proper and the Democratic Karen </p><p>Buddhist Army, which has since allied itself with the GOB), </p><p>the KNU has not been able to carry out any significant </p><p>military operations in Burma since 1996. </p><p> </p><p>Finishing the Job </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) Since then, the GOB has focused on reducing the </p><p>remaining centers of resistance and re-incorporating the </p><p>former insurgent territories within the Burmese Union. </p><p>Neither problem has been solved, but the outlines of the </p><p>government\'s plans are clear.  In the case of the remaining </p><p>active insurgencies, the GOB will continue to combine offers </p><p>of negotiation with military and diplomatic pressure.  For </p><p>the KNU, the KNPP, and other groups that the GOB recognizes </p><p>as legitimate representatives of national races in Burma, the </p><p>GOB has basically left the terms of the 1988-95 agreements on </p><p>the table.  As then, it is prepared to offer peace, amnesty, </p><p>self-administered areas, and the right to keep their arms and </p><p>private armies in return for pledges of loyalty to the Union </p><p>and a renunciation of armed struggle.  In contrast, it has </p><p>offered the Shan State Army-South only the surrender terms </p><p>originally accepted in 1996 by their original leader, Khun </p><p>Sa, and his Mong Tai Army. </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) Meanwhile, the GOB has maintained the military </p><p>pressure on these armed groups, extending its operations </p><p>right up to the Thai border, while relocating villages in </p><p>Shan, Karen, and Kayah States on which the Shan State Army </p><p>(South), the KNU, and the KNPP depend for support and </p><p>shelter.  For the insurgents, the effect of these operations </p><p>has been devastating.  Without the protection of a sheltering </p><p>population and faced with a serious enemy, most have </p><p>abandoned significant military operations.  The SSA now </p><p>almost never operates anywhere outside the range of covering </p><p>fire from Thai guns, while the KNU and KNPP have slowly </p><p>drifted towards banditry. </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) Finally, on the diplomatic front, the GOB has taken </p><p>advantage of Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra\'s </p><p>interest in stability, legality, and economic development in </p><p>northeast Thailand, and in securing Burmese cooperation in </p><p>pursuing those aims, to reduce Thai support for insurgent </p><p>groups.  This effort came to a head during the summer of </p><p>2002, following clashes on the Thai/Burmese border.  Since </p><p>then, it has become increasingly clear that the days of </p><p>launching insurgent attacks on Burma from Thai soil may </p><p>finally be over.  The remaining Burmese insurgent groups in </p><p>Thailand may be able to continue their political activities; </p><p>cross-border military action, however, will likely become </p><p>increasingly difficult. </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) This new Thai government approach has, in turn, put </p><p>the insurgents in a difficult position, forcing many to </p><p>seriously consider negotiations.  The KNPP, in fact, has </p><p>already split, with one fairly large group under Richard Htoo </p><p>having accepted the government\'s terms -- essentially </p><p>resuming the cease-fire agreement originally negotiated in </p><p>1995.  The KNU is also deep in negotiations with the GOB, </p><p>although it remains to be seen whether KNU strongman Bo Mya </p><p>will ever be able to bring himself to accept a cease-fire. </p><p>Even the SSA has asked for terms, though the difference </p><p>between what they are asking for (essentially autonomy within </p><p>their own self-administered region) and what the government </p><p>will give (basically an amnesty plus a new start in life for </p><p>individuals) is huge. </p><p> </p><p>Re-integration </p><p>15. (C) The GOB has coupled its continuing counter-insurgency </p><p>operations with efforts to re-incorporate former insurgents </p><p>in the Union.  Its approach has basically been to maintain </p><p>the spirit of the original cease-fire agreements -- at least </p><p>while the GOB was negotiating similar agreements with others </p><p>-- but to make clear that 1) everything depends on the </p><p>capacity of the former insurgent groups to maintain order in </p><p>their territories and 2) that nothing in those agreements </p><p>gives anyone the right to violate the law, or ignore other </p><p>political and administrative arrangements prevailing in the </p><p>Union.  The Kokang Chinese, in particular, have felt the bite </p><p>of the first condition.  When a coup by the Yang family (the </p><p>traditional rulers of the Kokang) and a counter-coup by Peng </p><p>Kya Shin split the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army </p><p>in to three separate groups during the mid-1990s, the GOB </p><p>picked a favorite (Peng Kya Shin) and moved in to </p><p>re-establish a Burmese Army presence (and now dominance) in </p><p>the previously sacrosanct cease-fire area.  Similarly, when a </p><p>mutiny split Mon Sa La\'s Mong Ko Defense Army in 2000, the </p><p>Burmese Army moved in, occupied Mong Ko and wiped both </p><p>competing bands off the map. </p><p> </p><p>16. (U) The GOB has also slowly extended its administrative </p><p>reach into the former insurgent territories through subsidies </p><p>and aid programs, the re-establishment of education and </p><p>health services, and introduction of Burmese police and </p><p>military operations.  In 2001, for the first time, the GOB </p><p>established a Burmese police presence in the Wa territories </p><p>and a Burmese military intelligence office in the Wa capital </p><p>of Pang Sang.  Requests for permission for government visits </p><p>to cease-fire areas or Burmese military transit through these </p><p>areas have also become largely perfunctory.  Where once it </p><p>really did ask permission, the GOB now merely notifies the </p><p>cease-fire groups that it is coming, and then goes, </p><p>regardless of whether it receives an answer or not. </p><p> </p><p>17. (C) On the legal front, the GOB has conditioned its </p><p>support for former insurgent groups on pledges by the groups </p><p>to make their regions opium-free.  Sai Lin of Shan State </p><p>Special region No. 2 around Mong La pledged to make his </p><p>region opium-free by 1997, and has apparently done so, albeit </p><p>while building Mong La into a flourishing center for gambling </p><p>and prostitution.  Peng Kya Shin of the Kokang Chinese, </p><p>similarly, pledged to be out of opium by 2000, but failed, </p><p>and is now paying the price for that failure through an </p><p>extended joint Burmese/Chinese police crackdown on Kokang </p><p>narcotics operations.  As for the Wa, they are due to be out </p><p>of opium by 2005 and are apparently on track. </p><p> </p><p>18. (C) Finally, by some well-managed diplomacy, the GOB has </p><p>earned China\'s support for both its law enforcement and its </p><p>political efforts.  Aroused by the growth of narcotics </p><p>trafficking from Burma into and through Yunnan Province, </p><p>China has changed from the historic ally of the BCP remnants </p><p>that now form many of these cease-fire groups into one of </p><p>their most resolute opponents, regularly demanding (and </p><p>getting) cease-fire group cooperation in the suppression of </p><p>narcotics production and trafficking all along its border </p><p>with Burma.  As nothing else could, these aggressive Chinese </p><p>law enforcement operations have illustrated for the </p><p>cease-fire groups the potential political consequences of </p><p>continued involvement with narcotics.  In simplest terms, the </p><p>Chinese and the Burmese together have made it known that </p><p>these  groups have no political future, if they stay with </p><p>drugs. </p><p> </p><p>Conclusions </p><p> </p><p>19. (C) A few basic points stand out from this history. </p><p>First, Burma\'s ethnic wars are all but over.  While a few </p><p>peace agreements have yet to be negotiated, all of those that </p><p>matter (with the KNU, the KNPP, and the SSA) could be </p><p>completed within the next few months, i.e., by the close of </p><p>the coming dry season. </p><p> </p><p>20. (C) Secondly, the SPDC is anything but a simple extension </p><p>of Ne Win\'s previous dictatorship, at least in its dealings </p><p>with the ethnic insurgents.  Where Ne Win was content to </p><p>neglect and exploit the border areas for the sake of security </p><p>in the Burman heartland, the SPDC has made defense of the </p><p>Union -- the entire Union -- a national priority.  That </p><p>approach has had its own consequences for ethnic minorities </p><p>-- the wars the SPDC has waged in the ethnic areas have been </p><p>real wars, not the trivial sweeps once orchestrated by Ne </p><p>Win.  However, the peace, autonomy, and opportunity for </p><p>development that the SPDC has offered these groups have been </p><p>equally real.  There has been no false dealing, a la Ne Win. </p><p> </p><p>21. (C) Thirdly, the political skills the SPDC has </p><p>demonstrated in dealing with these insurgencies belies their </p><p>image in the West as political buffoons.  While the SPDC has </p><p>generally responded ineptly when asked to perform in </p><p>accordance with the Western agenda on political and economic </p><p>liberalization, on issues of vital concern to themselves </p><p>(like these internal wars), they have acted with skills that </p><p>many other states (think of Russia with the Chechens) can </p><p>only envy.  The difference is in part a matter of priorities. </p><p> For the GOB, issues affecting the integrity of the union </p><p>come first; nothing else really gets as much high-level </p><p>attention. </p><p> </p><p>22. (C) That said, it is also worth noting that whatever </p><p>success the GOB has had in dealing with the insurgencies, </p><p>there are still major unresolved problems.  To start with, it </p><p>is still not clear how the government plans to integrate ad </p><p>hoc structures like the special regions into an enduring </p><p>constitutional order.  While it has been willing to allow the </p><p>cease-fire group leaders a voice in Burma\'s constitutional </p><p>debates, inviting several to its now suspended National </p><p>Conference, there is a large group of Burmans (and Burmese </p><p>Army officers), who would just as soon see these groups and </p><p>their special regions disappear entirely.  For the </p><p>government, keeping faith with the cease-fire leaders while </p><p>responding to the interests of these other influential groups </p><p>will be a challenge. </p><p> </p><p>23. (C) There has also been little international recognition </p><p>of the government\'s victory.  Regional states, such as </p><p>Thailand, China, and India, which were the countries most </p><p>affected by Burma\'s ethnic wars, have generally accepted the </p><p>GOB\'s success. In their view, the resulting stability was </p><p>far, far better than the lawlessness and anarchy that </p><p>prevailed for so many years.  In the West, the view is more </p><p>jaundiced.  Like regional states, some Western governments </p><p>have welcomed the re-establishment of order in areas </p><p>previously dominated by criminal elements.  However, others </p><p>were horrified by the human rights abuses that accompanied </p><p>the government\'s campaign in ethnic areas, solidifying their </p><p>view of the GOB as a brutal dictatorship. </p><p> </p><p>24. (C) Finally, but perhaps most seriously, there is really </p><p>no guarantee that the government\'s work will last.  For </p><p>whatever success the GOB has had over the past fourteen years </p><p>in ending the ethnic wars and reconstructing the Union of </p><p>Burma, it has failed miserably in dealing with its own </p><p>problems as a government.  Even setting aside the deep </p><p>resentment that it has engendered among the Burmese </p><p>themselves through the long denial of their basic human and </p><p>political rights, and its failure to deliver any semblance of </p><p>prosperity, it has also failed to establish a fiscal basis </p><p>for continued government.  Having tried, like many before </p><p>them, to run a government on the surpluses of state-owned </p><p>enterprises, the  SPDC has been left high and dry as those </p><p>surpluses have disappeared.  None of these problems are easy </p><p>to deal with, but, if the government does not deal with them </p><p>effectively, then all of its work in reconstructing the </p><p>Burmese Union, through war, diplomacy, and political </p><p>negotiations, could well be washed away. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
