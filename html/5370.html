<p>UNCLAS HARARE 000202 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF/S AND AF/EX </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JFRAZER </p><p>USDOC FOR 2037 DIEMOND </p><p>PASS USTR ROSA WHITAKER </p><p>TREASURY FOR ED BARBER AND C WILKINSON </p><p>USAID FOR MARJORIE COPSON </p><p> </p><p>E. O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, EFIN, ECON, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: Coca-Cola makes case for higher prices </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary: Coca-Cola reps have joined a procession </p><p>of companies lobbying the GOZ for a relaxation on price </p><p>controls.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Coca-Cola\'s Regional Director has met with </p><p>Zimbabwe\'s Finance and Trade/Commerce Ministers in the </p><p>past week to argue that his company cannot continue to </p><p>operate at a loss.  Each of Coca-Cola\'s Zimbabwe products </p><p>is now price-controlled.  The multinational lost US$ 3 </p><p>million here last year and will lose considerably more if </p><p>price controls are not relaxed.  Since it imports 80 </p><p>percent of its inputs, the company is unable to keep a </p><p>lid on costs.  Furthermore, its local operation is </p><p>cannibalizing operations in neighboring countries through </p><p>a brisk informal export of low-priced Zimbabwe products. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Comment: Zimbabwe has become one of the few </p><p>countries in the world where Coca-Cola is sometimes in </p><p>short supply -- unfortunate, since the country recently </p><p>enjoyed one of the highest per capita cola-consumption </p><p>rates in the world.  In the 1990s, it was Coke\'s 37th </p><p>worldwide market, impressive considering Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>modest 12-million population.  In past weeks, executives </p><p>from a multitude of companies and industries have treated </p><p>President Mugabe\'s cabinet to countless lessons in </p><p>Economics 101, or why they won\'t produce and sell </p><p>products below cost.  We only hope this logic penetrates </p><p>the President\'s inner circle before too many companies </p><p>seek greener pastures. </p><p> </p><p>Sullivan </p><p></p></div>
