C - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY: WITH N/S NEGOTIATIONS CONTINUING OVER </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION OF THE N/S BASIC AGREEMENT AND THE </p><p>NON-NUCLEAR ACCORD, KIM IL SUNG\'S APRIL 15 BIRTHDAY BASH, </p><p>KIM\'S NEW TITLE OF GENERALISSIMO, AND KIM JONG IL\'S </p><p>ELEVATION TO MARSHAL HAVE GENERATED ONLY MODEST PUBLIC </p><p>INTEREST IN THE SOUTH.  NORTH KOREA WATCHERS BELIEVE THE </p><p>NEW TITLES CONFIRM EARLIER INDICATIONS THAT KIM SENIOR </p><p>WILL NOT RETIRE, BUT THAT AT THE SAME TIME KIM JUNIOR WILL </p><p>TAKE ON EVER GREATER RESPONSIBILITIES.  MOST OBSERVERS </p><p>BELIEVE THE NORTH\'S POLICY LINE TOWARD THE SOUTH WILL </p><p>REMAIN UNCHANGED.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>NEW TITLES </p><p>---------- </p><p>3.  IN HONOR OF HIS 80TH BIRTHDAY ON APRIL 15 THE TITLE OF </p><p>GENERALISSIMO (DAEWONSU) WAS CONFERRED UPON KIM IL SUNG. </p><p>ON APRIL 20, THE DPRK ANNOUNCED THAT THE NORTH KOREAN </p><p>WORKERS PARTY HAD CONFERRED THE TITLE OF MARSHAL (WONSU) </p><p>ON KIM JONG IL AND O CHIN-U, MINISTER OF THE PEOPLE\'S </p><p>ARMED FORCES.  ACCORDING TO JAPANESE PRESS REPORTS, KIM </p><p>JONG IL ALSO MET WITH MEMBERS OF THE JAPANESE DELEGATION </p><p>WHO ATTENDED KIM SENIOR\'S BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION.  WHILE KIM </p><p>JONG IL HAS MET FOREIGNERS IN THE PAST, THE OCCASIONS HAVE </p><p>BEEN FEW AND FAR BETWEEN. </p><p> </p><p>"PROMOTIONS" NOT UNEXPECTED </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>4.  MOST NORTH KOREA OBSERVERS IN THE SOUTH EXPECTED SOME </p><p>CHANGES AROUND KIM IL SUNG\'S BIRTHDAY.  DR. KIL JEONG WOO </p><p>OF THE RESEARCH INSTITUTE FOR NATIONAL UNIFICATION TOLD </p><p>POLOFF APRIL 20 THAT AT HIS BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION KIM </p><p>SENIOR OFFICIALLY DESIGNATED HIS SON AS HIS SUCCESSOR </p><p>(SOMETHING HE HAD NEVER DONE BEFORE) AND MADE THE OCCASION </p><p>AN OPPORTUNITY FOR KIM JONG IL\'S "COMING OUT," I.E., WAS </p><p>INTRODUCED BY HIS FATHER AND MET WITH SOME FOREIGN </p><p>VISITORS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  KIL OBSERVED THAT IT WAS LOGICAL FOR KIM JONG IL TO </p><p>BECOME MARSHAL ONCE HIS FATHER HAD BECOME GENERALISSIMO. </p><p>ACCORDING TO KIL, THE TITLE OF MARSHAL IS HONORARY AND </p><p>POLITICAL IN NATURE AND DOES NOT CARRY GREAT MILITARY </p><p>SIGNIFICANCE, ESPECIALLY SINCE KIM JUNIOR WAS MADE SUPREME </p><p>COMMANDER LAST DECEMBER.  KIL SUGGESTED THAT THE CONFERAL </p><p>OF THE NEW TITLE SYMBOLICALLY FORMALIZES KIM JUNIOR\'S </p><p>INHERITANCE OF HIS FATHER\'S POSITION WITHOUT HAVING HIM </p><p>TAKE OVER.  KIM IL SUNG STILL HAS THE TITLES OF PRESIDENT </p><p>AND GENERAL SECRETARY OF THE KOREAN WORKERS PARTY (AND NOW </p><p>GENERALISSIMO).  KIL SAID THAT KIM JUNIOR IS RUNNING THE </p><p>DAY-TO-DAY AFFAIRS OF THE COUNTRY AND PROBABLY PLAYS AN </p><p>IMPORTANT ROLE IN FORMULATING FOREIGN POLICY.  IT WOULD </p><p>SEND THE WRONG SIGNALS, ACCORDING TO KIM\'S ANALYSIS, FOR </p><p>KIM JONG IL TO TAKE OVER HIS FATHER\'S ROLE COMPLETELY </p><p>DURING SUCH AN UNCERTAIN PERIOD FOR THE NORTH. </p><p> </p><p>6.  MOFA INTER-KOREA POLICY DIVISION DEPUTY DIRECTOR NAM </p><p>SANG-JUNG GAVE POLOFF A SIMILAR INTERPRETATION ON APRIL </p><p>22.  NAM SAID THAT KIM IL SUNG NOW "LEADS AND REIGNS" OVER </p><p>NORTH KOREA, WHILE KIM JONG IL "CONTROLS AND RUNS" THE </p><p>COUNTRY.  HE, HOWEVER, CITED THE PROMOTION OF O CHIN-U TO </p><p>MARSHAL ALONG WITH KIM JONG IL AS UNEXPECTED.  HE </p><p>EXPLAINED THAT O\'S PROMOTION MIGHT SERVE TWO PURPOSES. </p><p>FIRST, NAM EXPLAINED, THE NORTH CAN NOW ARGUE THAT THE </p><p>SUCCESSION WAS NOT DYNASTIC SINCE O AND KIM JUNIOR SHARE </p><p>THE SAME TITLE.  SECOND, THE PROMOTION OF O COVERS KIM </p><p>JONG IL\'S WEAK MILITARY FLANK BECAUSE O PRESUMABLY ENJOYS </p><p>STRONG SUPPORT AMONG MILITARY LEADERS. </p><p> </p><p>NO EFFECT ON NORTH/SOUTH DIALOGUE </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>7.  KIL, NAM, AND OTHERS WE HAVE TALKED TO DOUBT THAT THE </p><p>TITLE CHANGES IN THE NORTH WILL SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT </p><p>NORTH/SOUTH DIALOGUE.  BOTH EXPRESSED THE VIEW THAT HAVING </p><p>SIGNED THE IAEA SAFEGUARDS AGREEMENT AND THE TWO </p><p>NORTH/SOUTH AGREEMENTS, THE DPRK WILL PRESS FOR BETTER </p><p>RELATIONS WITH THE U.S., JAPAN, AND OTHER COUNTRIES, AT </p><p>THE SAME TIME STRINGING OUT IMPLEMENTATION OF THE </p><p>AGREEMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>SOUTH KOREAN PERCEPTIONS OF THE NORTH UNCHANGED </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>8.  KIM IL SUNG\'S BIRTHDAY BASH GENERATED ONLY MODEST </p><p>PUBLIC INTEREST IN THE SOUTH.  THE KIMS STILL RULE THE </p><p>DPRK, AND NEGOTIATIONS ON IMPLEMENTATION OF N/S DIALOGUE </p><p>AGREEMENTS HAVE YET TO ACHIEVE TANGIBLE RESULTS.  WITH THE </p><p>BIRTHDAY SPOTLIGHT ON THE "GREAT LEADER," SOUTH KOREANS </p><p>WERE REMINDED OF KIM IL SUNG\'S PERSONAL ROLE AS THE MAIN </p><p>OBSTACLE TO PROGRESS TOWARD REUNIFICATION. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p>9.  FROM ALL INDICATIONS, THE SUCCESSION PROCESS IS </p><p>UNDERWAY.  KIM JONG IL RUNS THE COUNTRY ON A DAY TO DAY </p><p>BASIS.  KIM SENIOR, HOWEVER, RETAINS HIS POWER AS THE </p><p>SUPREME FIGURE IN THE NORTH.  HE WILL IN ALL LIKELIHOOD </p><p>MAINTAIN HIS TITULAR SUPERIORITY WELL INTO THE PERIOD </p><p>AHEAD. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GREGG </p><p></p></div>
