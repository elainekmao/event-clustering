SUMMARY: AMBASSADOR PETERSON PAID FAREWELL CALLS IN </p><p>HCMC ON JUNE 11 AT THE CITY\'S EXTERNAL RELATIONS </p><p>OFFICE, AT THE HCMC COMMUNIST PARTY HEADQUARTERS, AND </p><p>AT THE HCMC PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE.  THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>REVIEWED THE PROGRESS MADE IN THE BILATERAL </p><p>RELATIONSHIP OVER THE PAST FOUR YEARS, NOTING THAT </p><p>RATIFICATION OF THE BILATERAL TRADE AGREEMENT (BTA), </p><p>WHICH IS NOW BEFORE THE U.S. CONGRESS, WOULD MARK THE </p><p>FINAL STEP IN THE NORMALIZATION PROCESS.  REMARKING ON </p><p>THE RISE IN THE STANDARD OF LIVING IN HCMC OVER THE </p><p>PAST FEW YEARS, THE AMBASSADOR SAID HE BELIEVED </p><p>IMPROVED BILATERAL RELATIONS HAVE HAD A SOCIAL AS WELL </p><p>AS AN ECONOMIC IMPACT ON THE VIETNAMESE PEOPLE.  HE </p><p>SAID THE USG WOULD LIKE TO TAKE A COOPERATIVE RATHER </p><p>THAN CONFRONTATIONAL APPROACH TO THE OBJECTIVE OF </p><p>IMPROVING CONDITIONS FOR HUMAN RIGHTS.  HE STATED USG </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HO CHI  00735  01 OF 03  150909Z </p><p>OBJECTIONS TO THE RECENT ARRESTS OF RELIGIOUS FIGURES </p><p>IN VIETNAM.  WHILE ACKNOWLEDGING THAT ALLOWING GREATER </p><p>POLITICAL AND SOCIAL FREEDOMS CARRIES THE RISK OF LESS </p><p>STABILITY, HE STATED EMPHATICALLY THAT THE RISKS ARE </p><p>FAR OUTWEIGHED BY THE UNLEASHING OF SOCIAL CREATIVITY </p><p>AND PRODUCTIVITY.  ALTHOUGH HIS VIETNAMESE </p><p>INTERLOCUTORS DEFENDED THEIR HANDLING OF "SUBVERSIVES" </p><p>AND EXPLAINED THEIR OUTLOOK REGARDING A FREE SOCIETY </p><p>VERSUS A STABLE SOCIETY, THEY APPEARED TO BE SINCERE IN </p><p>THEIR COMMENTS.  THEY THANKED THE AMBASSADOR FOR HIS </p><p>EFFORTS IN NORMALIZING RELATIONS, EXPRESSED HOPE FOR </p><p>EARLY RATIFICATION OF THE BTA, AND SAID THEY LOOKED </p><p>FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO BUILD ON THE FOUNDATION OF </p><p>TRUST AND FRIENDSHIP ESTABLISHED BETWEEN THE TWO </p><p>COUNTRIES THUS FAR.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>CALL AT EXTERNAL RELATION OFFICE </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. AT THE HCMC EXTERNAL RELATIONS OFFICE (THE HCMC </p><p>BRANCH OF THE FOREIGN MINISTRY), AMBASSADOR PETERSON </p><p>PAID A FAREWELL CALL ON DIRECTOR LE QUOC HUNG.  HUNG </p><p>WAS NAMED DIRECTOR IN APRIL.  PREVIOUSLY, HE WAS ONE OF </p><p>THREE DEPUTY DIRECTORS AND WAS THE PERSON IN CHARGE OF </p><p>COORDINATING THE HCMC PORTION OF PRESIDENT CLINTON\'S </p><p>VISIT TO HCMC IN NOVEMBER.  AMBASSADOR THANKED HUNG FOR </p><p>THE SUPPORT OF HIS OFFICE OVER THE PAST FOUR YEARS, </p><p>PARTICULARLY FOR ASSISTANCE ON VIP VISITS, AND </p><p>ESPECIALLY THAT OF PRESIDENT CLINTON. </p><p> </p><p>3. OVER THE PAST FOUR YEARS, THE BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HO CHI  00735  01 OF 03  150909Z </p><p>HAS MATURED, THE AMBASSADOR SAID, AND HAS BECOME MORE </p><p>COMPLEX.  THE TWO COUNTRIES WILL NOT ALWAYS AGREE ON </p><p>EVERY ISSUE, SO IT IS IMPORTANT TO CONTINUE TO BUILD ON </p><p>THE LEVEL OF TRUST THAT HAS BEEN ACHIEVED THUS FAR.  WE </p><p>HAVE REACHED A POINT WHERE WE CAN DISAGREE ON SOME </p><p>THINGS WHILE CONTINUING TO MOVE AHEAD ON OTHERS. </p><p> </p><p>4. THE AMBASSADOR STRESSED THE IMPORTANCE OF ALLOWING </p><p>U.S. DIPLOMATS TO TRAVEL AND MEET PEOPLE FREELY.  U.S. </p><p>MISSION OFFICERS CAN BE COUNTED ON TO REPORT </p><p>OBJECTIVELY, AND IN THIS WAY CAN BE ALLIES IN </p><p>DISPELLING EXAGGERATIONS AND RUMORS.  WE WILL REPORT ON </p><p>THINGS WE DO NOT AGREE ON, SUCH AS THE DETENTION OF </p><p>INDIVIDUALS FOR PEACEFULLY EXPRESSING THEIR OPINIONS, </p><p>BUT WE WILL ALSO REPORT ON THE POSITIVE THINGS VIETNAM </p><p>IS DOING. </p><p> </p><p>5. DIRECTOR HUNG AGREED THAT THE TWO COUNTRIES HAVE </p><p>BUILT A FOUNDATION OF TRUST IN THE FEW YEARS SINCE </p><p>DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WERE ESTABLISHED.  HE ADDED, </p><p>HOWEVER, THAT IN SOME PLACES AT CERTAIN LEVELS OF </p><p>GOVERNMENT, DISTRUST REMAINS - THE LINGERING RESULTS OF </p><p>A LONG AND PAINFUL WAR.  IT WILL TAKE TIME, HE SAID, </p><p>AND EFFORT TO KEEP THE RELATIONSHIP MOVING FORWARD. </p><p>BECAUSE THE BTA WOULD BE A MAJOR STEP FORWARD, HE HOPED </p><p>THE U.S. CONGRESS WOULD RATIFY THE BTA QUICKLY. </p><p> </p><p>6. IN REPLY TO AMBASSADOR PETERSON\'S REMARK THAT </p><p>AMERICAN PEOPLE FEEL STRONGLY ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS DUE TO </p><p>THEIR HISTORY AS A NATION FOUNDED BY REFUGEES WHO HAD </p><p>FLED INTOLERANCE, HUNG SAID HE UNDERSTOOD THE AMERICAN </p><p>PERSPECTIVE.  BUT HE SAID THE VIETNAMESE HISTORY OF </p><p>4000 YEARS OF FIGHTING OFF EXTERNAL INVADERS HAS MADE </p><p>ITS MARK ON THE VIETNAMESE PSYCHE.  VIETNAMESE PEOPLE </p><p>VALUE INDEPENDENCE AND FREEDOM FROM OUTSIDE </p><p>INTERFERENCE ABOVE ALL ELSE.  INDIVIDUAL FREEDOMS ARE </p><p>ALSO HIGHLY VALUED, BUT SHOULD BE LIMITED TO BALANCE </p><p>THE EQUALLY VALUED CONCEPTS OF STABILITY AND SECURITY. </p><p>HE NOTED THAT AT PRESENT, VIETNAM IS THE MOST </p><p>POLITICALLY STABLE NATION IN SOUTHEAST ASIA.  AND ITS </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HO CHI  00735  02 OF 03  150909Z </p><p>STABILITY IS ALLOWING VIETNAM TO DEVELOP ITS ECONOMY </p><p>AND IMPROVE THE STANDARD OF LIVING FOR ITS PEOPLE. </p><p> </p><p>7. AMBASSADOR PETERSON AGREED THAT FREEDOM SHOULD BE </p><p>LIMITED TO ACTIVITY WITHIN THE RULE OF LAW, BUT HE </p><p>QUESTIONED HOW ALLOWING ONE INDIVIDUAL, SUCH AS </p><p>BUDDHIST THICH HUYEN QUANG, TO FREELY CHOOSE HIS PLACE </p><p>OF RESIDENCE COULD HAVE ANY EFFECT ON VIETNAM\'S </p><p>SECURITY.  ALLOWING GREATER FREEDOM TO EXPRESS OPINIONS </p><p>DOES CARRY SOME RISKS, THE AMBASSADOR SAID, BUT THOSE </p><p>ARE OUTWEIGHED BY FAR BY THE UNLEASHING OF SOCIETY\'S </p><p>POTENTIAL FOR CREATIVITY AND PRODUCTIVITY. </p><p> </p><p>CALL AT HCMC COMMUNIST PARTY HEADQUARTERS </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. AMBASSADOR PETERSON ALSO MET WITH NGUYEN MINH TRIET, </p><p>SECRETARY OF THE HCMC PARTY COMMITTEE AND FOURTH- </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>RANKING MEMBERS OF VIETNAM\'S POLITBURO.  (TRIET IS </p><p>RUMORED TO BE THE FRONT-RUNNER TO SUCCEED PHAN VAN KHAI </p><p>AS PRIME MINISTER WHENEVER KHAI STEPS DOWN.)  THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR THANKED TRIET FOR VIETNAM\'S COOPERATION </p><p>DURING THE FIRST YEARS OF NORMALIZATION.  HE DREW </p><p>PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO VIETNAM\'S COOPERATION IN </p><p>LOCATING AMERICAN MIA\'S, WHICH WAS THE KEY TO </p><p>ESTABLISHING DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS.  HE EXPRESSED THE </p><p>USG DESIRE TO ASSIST VIETNAM IN LOCATING ITS OWN MIAS. </p><p> </p><p>9. THE AMBASSADOR TOLD TRIET THAT IT IS NORMAL FOR TWO </p><p>COUNTRIES TO HAVE DIFFERENCES - IT IS THE MARK OF A </p><p>MATURING RELATIONSHIP.  HE SAID THE U.S. DIPLOMATIC </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HO CHI  00735  02 OF 03  150909Z </p><p>MISSION HAS A DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF VIETNAM, PERHAPS </p><p>BETTER THAN AT ANY TIME IN THE PAST.  THIS WAS DUE TO </p><p>MISSION STAFF BEING ABLE TO TRAVEL AND MEET PEOPLE </p><p>FREELY.  HE NOTED THAT RECENT RESTRICTIONS ON TRAVEL TO </p><p>THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS HINDERED THE MISSION\'S ABILITY TO </p><p>UNDERSTAND THE TRUE PICTURE OF WHAT IS GOING ON THERE. </p><p>HE WISHED TO SEE THOSE TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS LIFTED </p><p>QUICKLY.  HE ALSO SAID THE GOVERNMENT OF VIETNAM OUGHT </p><p>TO ALLOW UBCV BUDDHIST PATRIARCH THICH HUYEN QUANG TO </p><p>RETURN TO HIS FORMER RESIDENCE IN HCMC, AND SUGGESTED </p><p>THE GVN MIGHT FIND IT EASIER TO DO THIS ON ITS OWN </p><p>INITIATIVE RATHER THAN WAITING FOR INTERNATIONAL </p><p>PRESSURE ON THE ISSUE TO BUILD. </p><p> </p><p>10. TRIET SAID THAT HE WANTED THE U.S. MISSION AND </p><p>OTHER OBSERVERS TO VISIT THE HIGHLANDS TO BE ABLE TO </p><p>UNDERSTAND THE TRUE CIRCUMSTANCES THERE.  HE SAID </p><p>GENERALLY VIETNAM PLACES NO RESTRICTIONS ON TRAVEL </p><p>WITHIN THE COUNTRY, BUT BECAUSE OF SAFETY CONCERNS, </p><p>THERE ARE TEMPORARY RESTRICTIONS ON TRAVEL TO SOME </p><p>PLACES IN THE HIGHLANDS.  TRIET ALSO SAID VIETNAM </p><p>RESPECTS RELIGIOUS ACTIVITIES, BUT RELIGIOUS PERSONS, </p><p>LIKE OTHER CITIZENS, MUST ABIDE BY THE LAWS OF THE </p><p>COUNTRY. HE SAID SOME INDIVIDUALS, BOTH WITHIN AND </p><p>OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY, HAVE USED RELIGIOUS FREEDOM AS A </p><p>PRETEXT FOR COMMITTING SUBVERSIVE ACTS.  TRIET SAID HE </p><p>REMEMBERED THAT IN HIS YOUTH (UNDER THE SOUTH </p><p>VIETNAMESE REGIME), HE AND OTHER STUDENTS WERE NOT </p><p>ALLOWED FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION, SO HE UNDERSTOOD THE </p><p>IMPORTANCE OF AN OPEN, DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY. </p><p> </p><p>11. THE AMBASSADOR NOTED THAT SEEN OVER THE LONG TERM, </p><p>VIETNAM HAS MADE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS.  THE CHURCHES ARE FULL; THERE IS MORE OPENNESS </p><p>AND MORE TOLERANCE OF CRITICISM.  BUT RASH RESPONSES TO </p><p>INDIVIDUALS WHO CHALLENGE THE GOVERNMENT ARE WHAT GRAB </p><p>THE HEADLINES.  THE USG WOULD LIKE TO COOPERATE WITH </p><p>VIETNAM IN CREATING CONDITIONS FOR FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS </p><p>IN HUMAN RIGHTS, AS WE HAVE IN OTHER AREAS.  THE BTA, </p><p>FOR EXAMPLE, WILL HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT ON OUR TWO </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HO CHI  00735  03 OF 03  150910Z </p><p>COUNTRIES FOR GENERATIONS.  THE USG HAS ALSO </p><p>ESTABLISHED A NEW SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM FOR VIETNAM THAT </p><p>COULD HELP PROVIDE HIGHER EDUCATION TO UP TO 200 </p><p>STUDENTS IN THE NEXT YEAR. </p><p> </p><p>12. TRIET AGREED WITH THE AMBASSADOR THAT THE TWO </p><p>COUNTRIES HAVE BUILT UP A FOUNDATION OF FRIENDSHIP AND </p><p>TRUST IN THE FIRST FEW YEARS OF NORMALIZATION. </p><p>ALTHOUGH SADDENED AT AMBASSADOR PETERSON\'S DEPARTURE, </p><p>HE LOOKED FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE NEXT AMBASSADOR </p><p>TO DEVELOP AN EVEN GREATER DEGREE OF UNDERSTANDING </p><p>BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES. </p><p> </p><p>MEETING WITH NEW PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13. AMBASSADOR PETERSON CONGRATULATED LE THANH HAI ON </p><p>HIS RECENT PROMOTION FROM FIRST VICE-CHAIRMAN TO </p><p>CHAIRMAN OF THE HCMC PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE.  HE SAID HE </p><p>WAS PROUD OF THE WAY THE BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP HAS </p><p>PROGRESSED, AND TOLD HAI THAT THE BTA WAS NOW IN THE </p><p>HANDS OF THE U.S. CONGRESS.  HE EXPECTED THE CONGRESS </p><p>TO RATIFY THE BTA, BUT NOTED THAT IT MAY TAKE UP TO TWO </p><p>MONTHS FOR IT TO DO SO.  HE SAID HE EXPECTED THE </p><p>AGREEMENT TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE ECONOMY </p><p>AND ON THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR THE PEOPLE OF HCMC. </p><p> </p><p>14. CHAIRMAN HAI SAID THAT DIFFICULTIES ARE ALWAYS </p><p>ENCOUNTERED AT THE BEGINNING OF NEW ENDEAVORS, BUT HE </p><p>BELIEVED THE FIRST FEW YEARS OF THE NEW U.S.-VIETNAM </p><p>BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP HAS YIELDED REMARKABLY GOOD </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HO CHI  00735  03 OF 03  150910Z </p><p>RESULTS.  HE HOPED THE U.S. CONGRESS WOULD RATIFY THE </p><p>BTA QUICKLY AND WAS CONFIDENT THE GVN WOULD DO THE </p><p>SAME.  HE SAID THE GOVERNMENT OF HCMC HAD JUST SENT A </p><p>PROPOSAL TO THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT OUTLINING SEVERAL </p><p>SPECIAL MECHANISMS FOR THE CITY TO ACT MORE ON ITS OWN </p><p>WITH REGARD TO ITS ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT.  WITH A MORE </p><p>STREAMLINED BUREAUCRACY, HE EXPECTED THE CITY TO </p><p>ACCELERATE ITS ALREADY HIGH ECONOMIC GROWTH RATE. </p><p>THAT, AND RATIFICATION OF THE BTA, SHOULD ATTRACT MORE </p><p>AMERICAN AND OTHER FOREIGN INVESTMENT TO THE CITY. </p><p> </p><p>15. THE AMBASSADOR SAID THAT A CORNERSTONE OF THE </p><p>BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP WAS THE SUPPORT THE GVN HAD </p><p>PROVIDED ON THE MIA ISSUE.  HE SAID THE COOPERATION </p><p>BETWEEN THE TWO GOVERNMENTS ON THIS ISSUE HAD DEVELOPED </p><p>INTO A PARTNERSHIP.  HE EXPECTED THE UNITED STATES AND </p><p>VIETNAM TO DEVELOP AN ECONOMIC PARTNERSHIP JUST AS </p><p>VITAL AND HOPED FOR GREATER UNDERSTANDING AND </p><p>COOPERATION IN OTHER AREAS AS WELL AS THE RELATIONSHIP </p><p>MATURED. </p><p> </p><p>RAY </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
