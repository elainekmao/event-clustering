<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 AMMAN 002561 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>FOR DRL/PHD,NEA/ARN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAID, KDEM, KSEP, PGOV, PHUM </p><p>SUBJECT: EMBASSY AMMAN\'S APPLICATION FOR HRDF GRANT FUNDS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 79965 </p><p>     B. AMMAN 1210 </p><p>     C. 02 AMMAN 5996 </p><p>     D. AMMAN 1432 </p><p> </p><p>1.  Embassy Amman welcomes the opportunity to compete for </p><p>funds from the Department\'s Human Rights and Democracy Fund </p><p>(HRDF).  The following proposals are tailored to criteria in </p><p>reftel, i.e. supporting critical mission human rights </p><p>priorities, relevance to foreign policy objectives, and </p><p>within Embassy Amman\'s proven capacity to administer funds to </p><p>assistance programs.  In 2002, Post administered programs </p><p>with human rights components totaling over USD 19 million </p><p>through USAID and USD 100,000 through Public Affairs (reftel </p><p>B). </p><p> </p><p>2. PROPOSED PROGRAMS </p><p> </p><p>A.  Supporting Family Guidance Center in Zarqa </p><p> </p><p>    i.  Background </p><p> </p><p>As reported in reftel C, The Family Guidance Center, directed </p><p>by long-time embassy contact Nadia Bushnaq, provides social </p><p>services to poor families in Zarqa.  The Center provides a </p><p>range of services (mostly to women), such as guidance on how </p><p>to cope with spousal abuse and raising children in poverty. </p><p>The Center has psychiatrists and legal counsel on site and </p><p>operates a hotline.  There are 40 employees, half of whom are </p><p>"field workers" performing outreach services throughout </p><p>Jordan.  A USAID funded family planning physician regularly </p><p>meets women at the center. </p><p> </p><p>The Center was registered in 1982 as a local NGO with the </p><p>Ministry of Social Development.  Bushnaq, who has 25 years of </p><p>experience in social work, is directly involved with </p><p>administering funds, and the Center has a full-time financial </p><p>accountant and auditor.  The Center produces an annual report </p><p>for the Ministry of Social Development.  Since 2000, the </p><p>Center has received 100,000 from the Ministry of Planning for </p><p>a Women\'s development center;  over 150,000 USD in E.U. funds </p><p>for an action plan against child abuse, volunteer youth </p><p>program and a senior citizen community service program; over </p><p>USD 100,000 from the Swiss Government to purchase a building </p><p>for the Center\'s activities;  and USD 10,000 from the British </p><p>Council for human rights and family protection projects.  In </p><p>addition, the Center works with USAID on family planning </p><p>programs.  Bushnaq will maintain a separate account for the </p><p>DRL funds and will provide a financial report detailing how </p><p>the funds were used. </p><p> </p><p>    ii.  Proposal for legal assistance program </p><p> </p><p>The Center provides legal services for approximately 500 </p><p>people, most of whom are women.  Many of these women are </p><p>victims of abuse, divorcees, and widows.  The Center </p><p>currently has a full-time attorney and part-time attorney to </p><p>assist the women with filing their cases and seeking redress </p><p>through the Jordanian courts.  The Center also provides legal </p><p>counsel to poor families attempting to manage their financial </p><p>affairs. </p><p> </p><p>Bushnaq would like to hire an additional attorney.  This </p><p>attorney would be the Center\'s "field attorney" and would be </p><p>able to provide services to women beyond the Zarqa area. </p><p>Bushnaq said she could hire a competent attorney for this </p><p>position with an annual salary of USD 2000.  With the new </p><p>attorney, Bushnaq anticipates the Center could provide legal </p><p>services to an additional 200 people in one year. </p><p> </p><p>In addition, the Center\'s legal team is looking to enhance </p><p>available funds to pay for the fees associated with carrying </p><p>legal actions in the local courts.  For example, a court </p><p>action for child support from a father who has abandoned his </p><p>family can cost a woman over USD 100 in court fees.  These </p><p>high costs are often prohibitive for poor people.  USD 5,000 </p><p>would create a fund that could be used within 12 months of </p><p>receipt of funds.  Thus, USD 7,000 will adequately fund this </p><p>program for one year. </p><p> </p><p>     iii.  Proposal for democracy and human rights program </p><p>for young adults </p><p> </p><p>Bushnaq is seeking to use the Center\'s Zarqa facilities to </p><p>provide discussions, activities and training courses on </p><p>democracy, human rights, and self-sufficiency.  The program </p><p>would be aimed at young adults (age range 18-25), most of </p><p>whom come from poverty stricken neighborhoods in Zarqa. </p><p>Bushnaq envisions discussions, group exercises, and </p><p>organizing sporting events and field trips throughout Jordan. </p><p> All activities will carry an underlying human rights theme. </p><p>Participants would be able to engage in individual (or </p><p>marital) counseling if they choose to. </p><p> </p><p>The curriculum would be geared toward enlightening the </p><p>participants on the negative effects of physical and verbal </p><p>abuse, and will encourage them to participate in and support </p><p>civic institutions.  Post will work with Bushnaq in selecting </p><p>the curriculum and materials.  Bushnaq estimates that she can </p><p>run the program with over 100 participants for approximately </p><p>USD 15,000.  Costs include: hiring a full-time project </p><p>director, assistant, and full-time social worker; purchasing </p><p>curriculum materials such as books and videos; and outlays </p><p>for transportation and administrative costs. </p><p> </p><p>     iv.  Post recommendation </p><p> </p><p>Post strongly endorses funding both programs.  The legal </p><p>services program will directly serve the needs of women who </p><p>have suffered human rights abuses such as rape and physical </p><p>abuse by facilitating opportunity for redress via the legal </p><p>system.  This will serve the critical mission priorities and </p><p>foreign policy objectives of a) empowering women in Islamic </p><p>society, particularly those suffering from abuse and poverty, </p><p>and b) promoting use of Jordanian courts by people who </p><p>traditionally have not done so because of cultural or </p><p>financial reasons.  Proper use of the courts by mainstream </p><p>society for redress of grievance is an essential component of </p><p>any democracy. </p><p> </p><p>The democracy and human rights program for young adults will </p><p>serve a human rights priority by focusing on young adults, </p><p>particularly males, who have yet to become entrenched in </p><p>habits or behavior that is abusive and destructive to their </p><p>families.  Post believes it will also be a window for us to </p><p>promote USG human rights and democracy goals through a </p><p>curriculum delivered by a credible, local organization. </p><p> </p><p>The Center has good relations with the GOJ and Bushnaq is a </p><p>long-time embassy contact (she has participated in our </p><p>international visitors program).  She has a proven track </p><p>record as an administrator of donor funds.  PolOff has made </p><p>several visits to the Center in Zarqa, including one with </p><p>Senior Coordinator for International Women\'s Issues April </p><p>Palmerlee in October 2002 (reftel c).  Based on our visits to </p><p>the Center and discussions with those who have received </p><p>services from the Center, we are highly confident the Center </p><p>would make outstanding use of HDRF funds. </p><p> </p><p>B. Supporting human rights training for GOJ officials </p><p> </p><p>     i.  Background </p><p> </p><p>In January 2003, The Ministry of Foreign Affairs established </p><p>a Human Rights Directorate (reftel C).  Subsequently, the </p><p>MFA\'s new Human Rights Coordinator contacted Post to inquire </p><p>about possible training opportunities for its diplomats in </p><p>the United States.  We responded that we did not have funds </p><p>to pay for Jordanian diplomats to travel to the U.S. for such </p><p>training, and suggested the possibility of a training program </p><p>here. </p><p> </p><p>     ii.  Proposal to train MFA diplomats on human rights law </p><p>and public policy </p><p> </p><p>Post would like to organize a one-week seminar for MFA </p><p>diplomats interested in receiving human rights training.  We </p><p>believe it will be most effective to bring expert/experts </p><p>from the United States human rights academic community as the </p><p>instructors and have them conduct the seminar at the Embassy. </p><p> The experts could come during the summer when their class </p><p>schedule in the US is presumably lighter.  Cost estimates for </p><p>such a program:  airfare (est. 2000 USD per traveler from </p><p>U.S.), 200 USD per day honorarium, 200 USD per diem, and </p><p>approximately 1000 USD for materials and incidental expenses </p><p>lead to an estimate of 11,000 USD for two experts conducting </p><p>a five day seminar on human rights law and public policy. </p><p>Post will coordinate with Department on appropriate </p><p>candidates in US academia to conduct the training. </p><p> </p><p>     iii.  Post recommendation </p><p> </p><p>We highly recommend funding this program.  The GOJ has </p><p>recently taken significant steps to establish an enhanced </p><p>human rights component (reftel D), and we have applauded </p><p>these efforts while prodding them to do more.  Now, they are </p><p>asking for our help in training.  This training would serve </p><p>the critical mission human rights priority and foreign policy </p><p>objective of enhancing the GOJ\'s capacity to move forward on </p><p>human rights issues that we regularly encourage them to </p><p>consider. </p><p> </p><p>c.  "Freedom of expression" training for Jordanian Judges </p><p> </p><p>     i.  Background </p><p> </p><p>The Jordanian Government recently rescinded Article 150 of </p><p>the Penal Code, which had granted the GOJ considerable </p><p>latitude in its discretion to prosecute journalists, editors </p><p>and publishers for publishing material that was considered, </p><p>inter alia, "harmful to the national unity".  The repeal of </p><p>Article 150 is a step forward, and we could help the GOJ </p><p>build on this by offering training to the judiciary on </p><p>freedom of expression, specifically as it relates to the </p><p>press. </p><p> </p><p>The judiciary should be encouraged to view freedom of </p><p>expression as a valuable right needed for a society to grow </p><p>and thrive politically and economically, as opposed to </p><p>viewing freedom of expression merely in a penal context.  In </p><p>addition, the judiciary should be exposed to comparative </p><p>interpretations of freedom of expression in legal systems </p><p>throughout the world, and given background on how other </p><p>judiciaries and societies have dealt with this important </p><p>human right during various stages of development. </p><p> </p><p>     ii.  Proposal for judicial training on freedom of </p><p>expression </p><p> </p><p>We propose a three-day workshop for Jordanian judges </p><p>organized in partnership with a local NGO to discuss a) the </p><p>value of freedom of expression in society and b) comparative </p><p>interpretations of freedom of expression by judiciaries </p><p>worldwide.  Linking freedom of expression and economic </p><p>development will be a key component of this workshop </p><p>(building on World Bank studies linking freedom of expression </p><p>with economic development.)  Post will invite a judicial </p><p>expert and/or law professor from the U.S. to discuss the </p><p>comparative aspects of the workshop, and we will also include </p><p>a session focusing on Jordanian law to led by local legal </p><p>experts and freedom of expression advocates. </p><p> </p><p>We anticipate the capacity to invite 10-15 judges to this </p><p>workshop, with an estimated cost of USD 8,000-15,000: USD </p><p>2000 per traveler from U.S., USD 200 per day honorarium, USD </p><p>200 per diem, and approximately USD 2000 for materials, and </p><p>miscellaneous expenses. </p><p> </p><p>     iii.  Post recommendation </p><p> </p><p>We highly recommend funding this program as the third of our </p><p>HRDF proposals.  There is a compelling need to educate, and </p><p>convince, the GOJ and the judiciary of the need for a </p><p>healthy, developing right to freedom of expression in Jordan. </p><p> We believe the GOJ has taken affirmative, initial steps </p><p>toward enhanced freedom of expression through the repeal of </p><p>Article 150, and we should do what we can to help the GOJ </p><p>build on it. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) COMMENT.  Post is very enthusiastic about </p><p>implementing the above programs.  We have the experience, </p><p>contacts and resources to make these proposals successful. </p><p>We also believe that these programs will go far, on a </p><p>dollar-for-dollar basis, toward goals of assisting abused </p><p>women, encouraging and strengthening democratic institutions, </p><p>and encouraging the GOJ when they take initiatives to train </p><p>their officials on human rights issues. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
