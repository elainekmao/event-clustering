<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 001370 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS, SA/RA </p><p>DEPT PLEASE PASS TO USAID FOR SA/ANE </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/GURNEY, NSC FOR MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/21/2013 </p><p>TAGS: KCOR, EAID, PGOV, NP, Government of Nepal (GON) </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL: ANTI-CORRUPTION AGENCY IN TROUBLE IN FIGHT </p><p>AGAINST BIG BUSINESS </p><p> </p><p>REF: KATHMANDU 1221 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Michael E. Malinowski for reasons 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary.  The head of Nepal\'s anti-corruption agency, </p><p>CIAA Commissioner Surya Nath Upadhyaya, met with the </p><p>Ambassador on July 18 to discuss the agency\'s investigation </p><p>into allegations of corruption within Nepal\'s two </p><p>government-owned banks.  The cases involve at least five of </p><p>the country\'s largest business houses and many high-level </p><p>bank officials.  As a result, the CIAA is coming under </p><p>increasing pressure from the political elite, banking and </p><p>business sectors and the media not to prosecute these cases. </p><p>Commissioner Upadhyaya appealed to the Embassy, and the donor </p><p>community at large, for its public support of the CIAA\'s </p><p>efforts.  Post plans to provide behind-the-scenes advocacy </p><p>for this vanguard organization active in promoting government </p><p>transparency.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) On July 18, Ambassador Malinowski met with head </p><p>Commissioner Surya Nath Upadhyaya of the Commission to </p><p>Investigate Abuses of Authority (CIAA).  USAID Country </p><p>Director and PolOff also attended the meeting.  Commissioner </p><p>Upadhyaya explained that he had requested the meeting not </p><p>only to provide the Ambassador with an update on the CIAA\'s </p><p>pending cases, but also to seek the Embassy\'s moral and </p><p>financial support, particularly in the CIAA\'s investigation </p><p>and prosecution of bank cases (versus property cases) </p><p>involving some of Nepal\'s most influential families. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Nepal Bank Limited (NBL) and Rastriya Banya Bank </p><p>(RBB), both government-owned banks, dominate the banking </p><p>sector in Nepal; approximately 60 percent of loans and 70 </p><p>percent of deposits nation-wide reside in these two banks. </p><p>Due to lack of sufficient capital, two years ago both banks </p><p>stopped issuing new loans.  After pressure from the World </p><p>Bank, in 2001 the Government of Nepal agreed to privatize the </p><p>banking industry, and subsequently foreign consultants were </p><p>brought in to restructure NBL and RBB.  In early 2003, the </p><p>foreign consultants brought to the CIAA\'s attention evidence </p><p>of corruption in the handling of bank loans to private </p><p>entities.  At least five of Nepal\'s 25 big business houses </p><p>have been implicated in these allegations, said Upadhyaya. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) After six months of work, Upadhyaya confided, the CIAA </p><p>has been able to complete investigations into several bank </p><p>cases and has found clear evidence of corruption.  The basis </p><p>for the original loan awards was "shaky," he said.  Moreover, </p><p>Upadhyaya stated that the loans were extended again and again </p><p>so that the original loan amount was doubled and "nothing was </p><p>ever repaid."  He specifically mentioned the case involving </p><p>the Amatya family, who own and operate the five-star Fulbari </p><p>Hotel in Pokhara, 180 kilometers west of Kathmandu.  Nepal </p><p>Bank Limited had awarded the original loan for the </p><p>construction and initial operation of the Fulbari Hotel. </p><p>After unsuccesful attempts by NBL to extract payments from </p><p>the Amatya family for the loan, the bank sought to go after </p><p>the family\'s other assets.  However, the other assets are </p><p>protected through incorporation elsewhere, Upadhyaya said. </p><p>After evaluating the hotel\'s assets using standards </p><p>formulated by the Asia Development Bank, Upadhyaya explained, </p><p>a clear case of bad investment, misrepresentation and fraud </p><p>was discovered.  Moreover, he said, there is evidence that </p><p>bank officials involved in granting the loans knew that the </p><p>loans would not be repayed.  Upadhyaya also suggested that </p><p>money for the Fulbari hotel was siphoned off for use in other </p><p>projects not covered by the loan. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Because these bank cases involve Nepal\'s most </p><p>influential families, the CIAA is under pressure from some </p><p>political influentials, the banking and business sectors and </p><p>the media not to prosecute.  Upadhyaya reported that in early </p><p>July, the Federation of Nepal Chambers of Commerce and </p><p>Industry (FNCCI) staged a demonstration of at least fifty </p><p>people in front of the CIAA building to protest the CIAA\'s </p><p>involvement in reviewing and investigating loans.  The media </p><p>also have been at the forefront; Upadhyaya expressed his </p><p>suspicions that several recent articles in the Telegraph and </p><p>People\'s Review suggesting that the CIAA should not be </p><p>involved in bank cases had been paid for and planted by some </p><p>of the wealthy families implicated in the cases.  Upadhyaya </p><p>also indicated that some of the defendents in these cases </p><p>were at various times the Ministers under whom he used to </p><p>work. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) The Commissioner concluded the meeting with an appeal </p><p>to the Ambassador for his public support of the CIAA\'s role </p><p>in prosecuting bank cases.  Upadhyaya said that without the </p><p>support of the international community, the CIAA "alone could </p><p>not make a difference."  He even suggested that he had been </p><p>subject to threats, saying "I\'m ready to risk my life, but </p><p>without your help, I won\'t get anywhere."  Upadhyaya also </p><p>requested U.S. assistance in training CIAA prosecutors in </p><p>investigation techniques as well as the provision of </p><p>equipment, such a lie detectors. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Comment.  The CIAA has taken an increasingly tough </p><p>stance on prosecuting high-level corruption cases. </p><p>Commissioner Upadhyaya is a strong leader and has taken an </p><p>impartial and professional approach in the investigation and </p><p>prosecution of corruption.  However, Nepal\'s highly </p><p>politicized and partisan civil society, combined with ongoing </p><p>political instability, has significantly challenged the </p><p>CIAA\'s effectiveness.  All the large business houses are </p><p>involved directly in politics and well-connected within the </p><p>political class.  Likewise, local publishing houses are </p><p>subject to the political persuasion of their owners.  To </p><p>counter this pressure, Post believes CIAA needs increased </p><p>international support.  Post plans to provide </p><p>behind-the-scenes advocacy as well as a coordinating role in </p><p>pushing for more plublic support of the CIAA by the </p><p>diplomatic and INGO community in Nepal.  End Comment. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
