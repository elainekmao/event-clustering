<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 000658 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR SA, SA/INS, S/CT; NSC FOR E. MILLARD </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL:  04-16-13 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, PHUM, CE, JA, NO, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  In visit to eastern Sri Lanka, contacts complain </p><p>about increased political influence of the Tamil Tigers </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  Colombo 643, and previous </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Lewis Amselem, Deputy Chief of Mission. </p><p>Reasons:  1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY:  Poloff and Pol FSN visited Trincomalee, </p><p>the major port city in eastern Sri Lanka, on April 12. </p><p>Interlocutors expressed admiration for the government\'s </p><p>efforts to achieve a negotiated settlement to the conflict, </p><p>but expressed deep concerns about the Tamil Tigers\' </p><p>commitment to the process.  The political influence of the </p><p>Tigers in the east is reportedly increasing due to their </p><p>use of mafia-like threats and harassment.  The Tigers were </p><p>also accused of continued forced recruitment of children. </p><p>Despite all the concerns, easterners expressed strong </p><p>support for the peace process.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>============================== </p><p>Reactions to the Peace Process </p><p>============================== </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Poloff and Pol FSN visited Trincomalee, the major </p><p>port city in eastern Sri Lanka, on April 12.  Ahead of the </p><p>Sinhalese/Tamil New Year, the sun-drenched, palm-fringed </p><p>city was bustling with activity.  Compared with years past, </p><p>when the city and region were the site of much violence, </p><p>the setting -- thanks to Sri Lanka\'s 15-month old peace </p><p>process -- seemed remarkably cheerful, almost festive. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) In line with these atmospherics, Mission contacts </p><p>in "Trinco," as it is known, were generally positive about </p><p>the peace process.  A wide range of interlocutors </p><p>invariably expressed admiration for the government\'s </p><p>efforts to achieve a negotiated settlement to the conflict. </p><p>Father George Dissanayake, a Catholic priest who is a human </p><p>rights activist, seemed to summarize hopes when he </p><p>commented that "Ranil (Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe) </p><p>will not let us down." </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) While the GSL earned kudos for its efforts, there </p><p>was little confidence in the Liberation Tigers of Tamil </p><p>Eelam (LTTE).  Tamils contacts asserted that the Tigers </p><p>continued to extort funds and violate human rights (see </p><p>below), activities which undermined the view that the group </p><p>was on its way toward becoming a peaceful political </p><p>organization.  In addition, the Sinhalese community, </p><p>especially the Buddhist clergy, expressed doubts about the </p><p>LTTE\'s commitment to the peace process, noting that the </p><p>group had taken no steps to disarm or demobililize its </p><p>forces.  (Note:  Trincomalee District is an ethnic mosaic, </p><p>with Muslims, Sinhalese, and Tamils represented in roughly </p><p>equal numbers.) </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Reflecting on these concerns about the LTTE and the </p><p>peace process, the local Deputy Chief of the Norwegian-run </p><p>Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission (SLMM) Abdel Burkan commented </p><p>that he thought that the uneasiness was a function of </p><p>natural anxiety following 20 years of war and 14 months of </p><p>"not-quite peace."  SLMM Head of District Jan Ledang told </p><p>poloff that the situation would remain tense and unsettled </p><p>until there was a final outcome in the negotiations. </p><p> </p><p>===================================== </p><p>LTTE:  Increasing Political Influence </p><p>===================================== </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Interlocutors told Poloff in no uncertain terms that </p><p>the LTTE was increasingly exerting a high degree of </p><p>influence in Trincomalee District.  Much of the influence </p><p>was described as being the direct result of harassment and </p><p>threats.  The LTTE was accused of continuing to "tax" </p><p>citizens in Trincomalee, for example.  (Note:  According to </p><p>observers, the usual LTTE "assessment" is a few hundred </p><p>rupees, approximately 1-2 USD, and the taxes are generally </p><p>leveled at low-to mid-level tradesmen and teachers.) </p><p>Poloff was told of the example of a local bus owner, who </p><p>was stopped every day for a month by the LTTE for a tribute </p><p>of Rs. 100 (approximately one USD).  Contacts did note that </p><p>the LTTE, in general (and unlike its behavior in the past), </p><p>refrained from physically harming perceived opponents. </p><p>(Note:  Per Reftels, however, there have been some recent </p><p>reports of instances where the LTTE has reportedly been </p><p>involved in killing opponents, including government </p><p>informants.) </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Contacts traced the rise in the LTTE\'s political </p><p>influence in Trincomalee, in part, to the freedom of </p><p>movement the LTTE enjoys as a function of the February 2002 </p><p>ceasefire accord.  The Tigers are reportedly using that </p><p>freedom of movement to harass people and also mobilize </p><p>support.  One contact related that the LTTE had recently </p><p>opened an office in downtown Trincomalee and were using the </p><p>office to organize regular meetings and rallies.  These </p><p>rallies often took on a semi-threatening tone.  In </p><p>reviewing these means of influence, contacts commented that </p><p>there was no incentive for LTTE to transform into a </p><p>"normal" political entity -- if the group did; their main </p><p>sources of revenue (taxation and extortion) and influence </p><p>(harassment and threats) would dry up. </p><p> </p><p>================================== </p><p>Forced Child Recruitment Continues </p><p>================================== </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Local religious leaders and the representatives of </p><p>other organizations such as UNICEF, UNHCR, and the SLMM </p><p>told poloff that forced child recruitment continues in </p><p>Trincomalee district. In fact, according to most observers, </p><p>child conscription has, if anything, increased in the past </p><p>year.  Observers were vague on the exact numbers of child </p><p>conscriptees, however.  In their conscription efforts, the </p><p>Tigers are apparently using a mix of coercion and also </p><p>Tamil nationalist propaganda to lure parents to give their </p><p>children over to the LTTE.  Contacts also remarked that </p><p>Tiger recruitment of adults also continues on an increased </p><p>scale. </p><p> </p><p>======= </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>======= </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) When compared with previous visits to Trincomalee, </p><p>the level of concern emanating from all communities </p><p>regarding the LTTE seems, if anything, to have spiked up. </p><p>In a coordinated effort, the group appears to be using the </p><p>ceasefire to spread its tentacles in almost a mafia-like </p><p>fashion.  That said, despite all the concerns focused on </p><p>the Tigers, easterners expressed strong support for the </p><p>peace process.  As with most Sri Lankans, people in </p><p>Trincomalee want the peace process to work and they seem </p><p>patient.  This is good news for the government, but is </p><p>ultimately a wasting asset if the LTTE does not improve its </p><p>behavior.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
