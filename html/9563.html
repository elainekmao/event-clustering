<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 COLOMBO 001290 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS, S/CT; NSC FOR E. MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:   DECL:  07-24-13 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, PINS, PHUM, CE, NO, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT: Peace Process Update:  Discussion of latest GSL </p><p>proposal re north/east intensifies; Tigers stir the pot </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  (A) FBIS Reston Va DTG 230531Z Jul 03 </p><p> </p><p>-      (B) FBIS Reston Va DTG 230518Z Jul 03 </p><p>-      (C) FBIS Reston Va DTG 220532Z Jul 03 </p><p>-      (D) Colombo 1284, and previous </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by James F. Entwistle, Charge d\'Affaires. </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) This update of Sri Lanka\'s peace process reviews </p><p>the following: </p><p> </p><p>>> Norwegian envoy discusses government\'s latest </p><p>proposal re north/east with Tamil Tigers </p><p> </p><p>>> Tigers ramp up agitation campaign in the north/east </p><p> </p><p>>> Defying international monitors, Tigers refuse to </p><p>vacate military camp </p><p> </p><p>>> The 20th anniversary of Colombo\'s deadly anti-Tamil </p><p>riots passes peacefully </p><p> </p><p>>> Flavor of the Peace Process:  GSL Customs seizes </p><p>Tiger propaganda materials, but looks set to release </p><p>them </p><p> </p><p>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= </p><p>Norwegians review GSL proposal with Tigers </p><p>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Discussion of the latest Sri Lankan government </p><p>proposal on forming an interim administration in the </p><p>north/east is intensifying.  (Note:  See Ref D for </p><p>details of the proposal.)  In response to a request from </p><p>the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), Norwegian </p><p>Special Envoy Jon Westborg, who delivered the proposal </p><p>to the Tigers on July 17, traveled to the LTTE- </p><p>controlled town of Kilinochchi in northern Sri Lanka on </p><p>July 22.  While there, Westborg -- in a meeting with </p><p>LTTE political chief S.P. Thamilchelvan -- answered </p><p>several specific questions about the proposal.  In </p><p>public, Westborg described the meeting as "very </p><p>positive."  In private, he was even more effusive, </p><p>telling Indian High Commissioner Nirupam Sen that </p><p>Thamilchelvan\'s initial reaction to the proposal was </p><p>"quite encouraging." </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) COMMENT:  The LTTE probably will need several </p><p>more weeks to review the proposal before formulating a </p><p>final response.  At this point, the group\'s reaction </p><p>seems relatively constructive.  The government, in the </p><p>meantime, has to keep an eye out for reaction in the </p><p>south.  President Kumaratunga and her party, which share </p><p>a tense cohabitation relationship with the GSL, are </p><p>hinting that they oppose the proposal, for example. </p><p>Moreover, some Muslims from the east, worried about LTTE </p><p>influence in that ethnically mixed region, have already </p><p>spoken out against it.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- </p><p>Tigers stir the pot in the north/east </p><p>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) While their reaction to the latest peace </p><p>proposal has been relatively positive, the Tigers </p><p>continue to ramp up tensions on the ground in the </p><p>north/east.  Two recent incidents highlight the group\'s </p><p>latest agitation campaign.  In the first, a clearly </p><p>marked vehicle belonging to the Norwegian-run Sri Lanka </p><p>Monitoring Mission (SLMM) was pelted with rocks on </p><p>July 21 as it traveled near Batticaloa in the east.  No </p><p>one was injured in the incident, which was almost </p><p>certainly perpetrated by pro-LTTE Tamils.  In the second </p><p>incident, GSL Minister of Rehabilitation J. Jayawardena </p><p>was prevented from attending a European Union-sponsored </p><p>ceremony held in Jaffna.  An unruly mob consisting of </p><p>students and suspected LTTE cadres jostled Jayawardena, </p><p>forcing him to flee the scene. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) COMMENT:  As is a ritual with the group, the </p><p>Tigers deny any involvement in any sort of intimidation, </p><p>though the incidents described above bear all the </p><p>hallmarks of LTTE tactics (use of crowds that melt away, </p><p>etc.).  It is not clear why the Tigers appear to be </p><p>turning up the heat in the north/east at this time.  The </p><p>group has made clear that it is angry over the recent </p><p>arrest of several of its cadre by government security </p><p>forces, however.  (Note:  The government says the cadre </p><p>were illegally carrying weapons.)  The fact that a SLMM </p><p>vehicle was attacked is also very bad news.  This is the </p><p>first time the monitors have been involved in such an </p><p>incident.  (Note:  The incident may be linked to the </p><p>worsening LTTE-SLMM relationship described below.)  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= </p><p>LTTE defies Monitors on Camp </p><p>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) A LTTE-constructed camp near Trincomalee in </p><p>the east continues to be the subject of controversy.  In </p><p>comments made to the press on July 23, SLMM Deputy Chief </p><p>Hagrup Haukland lashed out at the Tigers, stating that </p><p>the LTTE must remove the so-called "Wan Ela" camp. </p><p>(Note:  After a recent land survey, the SLMM determined </p><p>that the camp encroaches on government-controlled </p><p>territory -- see Ref D for additional background.) </p><p>Haukland, who had also hit out hard against the LTTE on </p><p>this matter last week, underscored that the group must </p><p>comply with SLMM rulings, per its acceptance of the </p><p>February 2002 ceasefire accord.  For their part, the </p><p>Tigers have refused to vacate the camp, asserting that </p><p>it is located in a zone controlled by its forces. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) COMMENT:  The monitors are clearly growing more </p><p>exasperated with the LTTE day-by-day.  The SLMM </p><p>undoubtedly feels insulted that it is not being listened </p><p>to, hence Haukland\'s increasingly shrill comments to the </p><p>press.  Mission has spoken to SLMM representatives, and </p><p>they say that they are trying to manage the controversy </p><p>and make sure that it does not lead to a complete </p><p>breakdown in ceasefire monitoring.  The solution to the </p><p>problem seems simple; the LTTE should withdraw.  It is </p><p>not yet clear, how far the Tigers want to press this </p><p>matter, however.  Up to now, LTTE has by and large tried </p><p>to maintain fairly good relations with the monitors. </p><p>END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- </p><p>Quiet Anniversary of Deadly Riots </p><p>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) The 20th anniversary of the July 1983 riots in </p><p>Colombo passed peacefully in Sri Lanka.  The riots -- </p><p>which started on July 23, 1983 and lasted several days </p><p>-- led to the deaths of hundreds of Tamils, with </p><p>thousands driven from their homes.  The local press ran </p><p>some stories on the riots, but there was no official </p><p>government ceremony.  The one incident that seemed to be </p><p>linked to the anniversary was an attempt by some Tamils </p><p>to put up a statue of a deceased LTTE fighter in Jaffna </p><p>on July 23.  The pro-LTTE group was interrupted by </p><p>government security forces and fled the scene with the </p><p>statue.  No one was injured in the incident.  (Note:  The </p><p>statue was of Charles Anthony, a LTTE squadron leader, </p><p>who was killed during the July 1983 attack on government </p><p>forces that triggered the Colombo riots.  Anthony was a </p><p>close associate of LTTE leader V. Prabhakaran.) </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU) COMMENT:  Most observers date the 1983 riots </p><p>as the start of the ethnic conflict.  Certainly, there </p><p>is little doubt that the riots divided the Sinhalese- </p><p>Tamil communities in a very profound way.  The GSL has </p><p>made some effort to come to terms with the killing of so </p><p>many of its citizens; President Kumaratunga, for </p><p>example, ordered a commission to examine what happened </p><p>and put together a report.  The sad fact, however, is </p><p>that no one has ever been charged for the mayhem that </p><p>took place.  As for the LTTE, the group has used the </p><p>event as an effective recruiting tool with Tamils.  It </p><p>has also on occasion launched deadly attacks, such as </p><p>that on Colombo\'s airport in July 2001, to "commemorate" </p><p>what took place.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- </p><p>The Case of the LTTE\'s Propaganda Materials </p><p>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) In our flavor of the peace process section: </p><p>Sri Lankan customs officials working at Colombo port </p><p>recently seized two shipping containers headed for the </p><p>LTTE-controlled Wanni region.  In taking the action, the </p><p>customs officials asserted that the containers -- with </p><p>contents listed as "stationery" -- included LTTE flags, </p><p>key chains, LTTE magazines, and stickers.  Of special </p><p>note, were maps depicting areas of the north and east as </p><p>a separate LTTE-controlled entity ("Eelam").  It is not </p><p>clear where the containers were shipped from and in </p><p>whose name, but they are believed to have been ordered </p><p>by the LTTE\'s propaganda department.  The latest word is </p><p>that customs plans to release the material because -- </p><p>under the terms of the ceasefire accord -- the GSL has </p><p>no grounds to hold them as contraband. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (SBU) COMMENT:  Before the advent of the peace </p><p>process in December 2001, the type of materials seized </p><p>at the port would have been immediately destroyed by the </p><p>GSL.  Now, with the peace track months old, the </p><p>transshipment of such "propaganda" items is a relatively </p><p>ho-hum affair.  (Note:  Some groups skeptical of the </p><p>peace process complained about the materials, but did </p><p>not gain much traction and clammed up.)  In general, as </p><p>far as the GSL is concerned, materials of a non-warlike </p><p>nature can be provided to the LTTE, including those that </p><p>are basically political in nature.  (Note:  That said, </p><p>there are clearly lines that cannot be crossed:  earlier </p><p>this month, the government complained that LTTE cadre </p><p>were showing videos of past war exploits to potential </p><p>recruits in the east.  The SLMM agreed with the </p><p>government that this type of LTTE activity was </p><p>provocative and inappropriate.)  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>12. (U) Minimized considered. </p><p> </p><p>ENTWISTLE </p><p></p></div>
