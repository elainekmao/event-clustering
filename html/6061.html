Nevertheless, the meeting </p><p>remains a useful venue to maintain a direct </p><p>donor/government dialogue on humanitarian </p><p>issues.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. On February 24, Ambassador Sullivan, USAID </p><p>Director Weisenfeld and AidOff attended the </p><p>regular bi-weekly U.N.-sponsored meeting on </p><p>the Zimbabwe humanitarian crisis with </p><p>concerned government and international donor </p><p>country representatives.  The meeting was </p><p>chaired by U.N. Humanitarian Co-ordinator </p><p>(UNHC) for Zimbabwe (J. Victor Angelo), with </p><p>country representatives from WHO, UNICEF, FAO </p><p>and WFP.  GOZ representatives included the </p><p>Minister of Health and Child Welfare (M/H&CW), </p><p>Dr. David Parirenyatwa, and senior-level </p><p>representatives from the GOZ ministries of </p><p>Public Service, Labor and Social Welfare </p><p>(M/PS,L&SW), Education, and Small Enterprise </p><p>Development.  Chiefs of Mission and associated </p><p>Donor Agency Heads of most major bilateral </p><p>donor countries to Zimbabwe also attended. </p><p> </p><p>3. Following introductory comments, the </p><p>meeting commenced with a prepared </p><p>presentation, accompanied by a written </p><p>handout, by the GOZ Director of Social Welfare </p><p>(Mhishi) on the government\'s cash-for-work </p><p>program and related GOZ Grain Marketing Board </p><p>(GMB) food sales/distribution activities. </p><p>This was the first time the GOZ described to </p><p>the donors in any detail the mechanics of its </p><p>food distribution programs.  The presentation, </p><p>however, explained the theory of the programs </p><p>and did not address actual, on-the-ground </p><p>experience with implementation or allegations </p><p>of politicization or corruption.  Highlights </p><p>of the GOZ\'s presentation follow: </p><p> </p><p>-A. Rural and Urban Public Works Program (RU- </p><p>PWP): </p><p>- As explained by the GOZ representative, the </p><p>purpose of the "cash-for-work" program is "to </p><p>provide a quick response for the support of </p><p>vulnerable households (HHs) and individuals </p><p>through cash transfers for labor-intensive </p><p>public works co-ordinated by local </p><p>authorities" to enable the beneficiaries to </p><p>purchase food. </p><p>- The chronically ill, elderly and disabled </p><p>receive free cash allowances to purchase food </p><p>(see GMB distributions/sales system below); </p><p>the able-bodied work for their cash/food. </p><p>Separate registers for each of these two </p><p>categories of beneficiaries are maintained at </p><p>the local (village/ward/district) level. </p><p>- Benefiting HHs receive ZWD 1500 per month </p><p>for 15 days of work (equivalent to 3 </p><p>persons/HH working five days each per month). </p><p>The amount is based on the official controlled </p><p>price of maize (ZWD 560/kilogram), and the </p><p>fact that this income is only meant to </p><p>supplement other sources of income (and is not </p><p>meant to satisfy total food requirements). </p><p>Participants are paid weekly in urban areas, </p><p>and monthly in rural areas. </p><p>-Both beneficiaries and projects are selected </p><p>by traditional and conventional authorities at </p><p>the local level.  M/PS,L&SW provides monthly </p><p>allocations to each district based on need, </p><p>population estimates and drought intensity, as </p><p>reflected in various past and on-going </p><p>assessments.  On average, approximately </p><p>ZWD 1 million is provided to each ward in each </p><p>district per month. </p><p>- To date, the program is operational in all </p><p>58 rural districts, and 26 urban areas of the </p><p>country, benefiting approximately 1.3 million </p><p>HHs on a monthly basis.  The GOZ estimates </p><p>that approximately double this number (2.7 </p><p>million HHs) are eligible for participation in </p><p>this program. </p><p>- No special food purchase arrangements are </p><p>organized for program beneficiaries, i.e., </p><p>"once they receive their allowance, they join </p><p>everybody else to purchase food (via the GMB </p><p>sales/distribution system below)." </p><p> </p><p>-B. GMB Grain Distribution: </p><p>- The GMB grain distribution is headed a </p><p>National Task Force, chaired by the Minister </p><p>of National Security, N. Goche.  This Task </p><p>Force is responsible for government grain </p><p>purchases/imports and allocation of available </p><p>stocks to the different regions of the </p><p>country. </p><p>- Grain distribution is decentralized through </p><p>similar GMB and local government Task Forces </p><p>at the provincial, district, ward and </p><p>village levels. </p><p>- The distribution system varies for urban and </p><p>rural areas.  In urban areas, distribution </p><p>flows from millers to retailers for subsequent </p><p>sale to consumers through normal commercial </p><p>channels. </p><p>Due to perceived problems with this system </p><p>(e.g., alleged private sector hoarding, </p><p>conditional sales and black marketeering), </p><p>Mhishi stated that the GOZ is now looking at </p><p>the formation of Food Distribution Committees </p><p>to provide food directly to vulnerable urban </p><p>HHs "to ensure transparency and </p><p>accountability."  [Note: In response to an FAO </p><p>query on food availability in one Harare </p><p>suburban area, Mhishi characterized the Harare </p><p>area as a private sector "free-for-all" </p><p>situation under which it was next to </p><p>impossible to accurately trace food supplies.] </p><p>- In rural areas, grain is distributed through </p><p>existing GMB depots and fixed and mobile </p><p>"selling points," rather than through </p><p>commercial channels. "Beneficiary" registers </p><p>are maintained at the local (ward) level by </p><p>local authorities.  In response to a </p><p>follow-up question, Mhishi noted that </p><p>government program beneficiaries excluded </p><p>beneficiaries also receiving food aid through </p><p>WFP and other donor assistance. </p><p>- Mhishi described the major constraints to </p><p>this system include: </p><p>1) inadequacy of grain supplies (leading to </p><p>severe shortages, hoarding, black </p><p>marketeering and other abuses noted above); </p><p>2) transport problems (delays in rail </p><p>transport, WFP competition for available </p><p>transport assets); 3) cash shortages </p><p>(particularly to pay transporters); and 4) </p><p>lack of GMB capacity to properly monitor </p><p>system operations.  In response to a query on </p><p>the status of the proposal that of the U.N\'s </p><p>new Relief Information & Validation division </p><p>assist the government in meeting these program </p><p>monitoring requirements, Mhishi stated that </p><p>"this was part of a broader proposal that was </p><p>still being considered." </p><p> </p><p>4. The Director of Nutrition (M/H&CW) then </p><p>provided a brief summary report on the status </p><p>of the on-going national Nutritional/Expanded </p><p>Immunization Program survey.  Training </p><p>was completed in late-January/early-February; </p><p>data collection is complete in all districts, </p><p>except Binga which is expected to be completed </p><p>this week.  Data entry is in progress in all </p><p>districts, and is expected to be completed by </p><p>end-February.  Data analysis and report </p><p>writing will be completed in early-March, with </p><p>a final draft report expected o/a March 17. In </p><p>response to a query from SCF/UK on the need </p><p>for a more comprehensive "livelihoods" </p><p>approach to vulnerability assessment (as </p><p>opposed to relying too heavily on nutrition </p><p>data alone), the Director noted that this </p><p>survey was being closely co-ordinated with on- </p><p>going Vulnerability Assessment Committee work, </p><p>which would complement the nutrition survey </p><p>results with other household-level data. </p><p> </p><p>5. This discussion was followed by a </p><p>presentation by WFP Country Representative </p><p>Farrell summarizing, the status and future </p><p>situation of the on-going international food </p><p>assistance program for Zimbabwe.  Most of this </p><p>information was the same as that reported in </p><p>reftel A.  Additional highlights included: </p><p>- Despite a slower than hoped for start, </p><p>operations were generally going well now, with </p><p>a solid program pipeline projected through </p><p>April 2003. </p><p>- WFP projects a shortfall of 73,260 MT in May </p><p>and June (approximately half of which is </p><p>cereals).  This projection, however, was </p><p>disputed as not adequately reflecting reduced </p><p>beneficiary requirements as a result of the </p><p>March/April harvest.  Farrell\'s response was </p><p>that while current beneficiary numbers may </p><p>decrease during this period, additional </p><p>allocations would be required for heretofore </p><p>uncovered groups, such as the urban poor and </p><p>populations in commercial farming areas that </p><p>were becoming increasingly vulnerable. </p><p>Farrell also indicated that WFP would continue </p><p>to reevaluate its projected numbers of </p><p>beneficiaries over the coming months. </p><p>- Despite a current serious bottleneck at the </p><p>Beitbridge border post (due to GOZ </p><p>road/parking rehabilitation work), WFP still </p><p>expected to be able to meet its import targets </p><p>and pipeline requirements. </p><p>- A major problem was lack of (government) </p><p>market supplies of food in rural areas; in </p><p>many areas, international food aid was </p><p>becoming the "vast majority" of available </p><p>supplies.  In this regard, Farrell noted the </p><p>need for more specific and detailed </p><p>information on GOZ/GMB distributions and </p><p>future import plans and schedules.  In </p><p>response, the GOZ noted that while we could </p><p>"count on" government figures already provided </p><p>through April 2003, they had no reliable </p><p>information at present on GOZ imports beyond </p><p>that time. </p><p>- The GOZ expressed their concern that there </p><p>were no additional international aid supplies </p><p>indicated beyond June 2003 (when the next </p><p>"hungry season" begins). </p><p>- In response to the stated preference for </p><p>wet/blanket (vs. dry ration) supplementary </p><p>feeding for children by the M/H&CW, WFP </p><p>indicated that it was starting to phase out </p><p>its dry supplementary feeding ration over the </p><p>next few months in response to the increased </p><p>coverage (and preference) for wet/blanket </p><p>supplementary feeding programs through </p><p>bilateral NGO programs.  In the course of this </p><p>discussion, M/H&CW\'s Director of Nutrition </p><p>stated that two UNICEF handouts on </p><p>supplementary child feeding activities </p><p>throughout the country were inaccurate (UNICEF </p><p>maintains that they were compiled with full </p><p>Ministry knowledge and participation). </p><p> </p><p>6. Following these major presentations, the </p><p>U.K. announced a new British Pound 5.35 </p><p>million contribution to the Zimbabwe relief </p><p>effort.  Approximately British Pounds 4.1 </p><p>million of this contribution would be used to </p><p>help cover the costs of transporting </p><p>Zimbabwe\'s share (64,000 MT) of the recent </p><p>100,000 MT South Africa contribution to the </p><p>regional food crisis to Zimbabwe, with the </p><p>balance of 1.25 million to be used by WFP for </p><p>additional cereals. Thanking the British for </p><p>this additional contribution, UNHC Angelo </p><p>noted that the Norwegians were also </p><p>contributing to the transport costs of this </p><p>South Africa maize. </p><p> </p><p>7. Other Points: </p><p>- In response to queries regarding the </p><p>likely crop harvest prospects, the GOZ </p><p>stated that reliable information on the </p><p>current season harvest will not be available </p><p>until the formal mid-season crop </p><p>assessment is completed in March. </p><p>- In response to a British query following-up </p><p>on various policy issues raised at prior </p><p>meetings, the UNHC noted that the recent </p><p>Economic Stimulus Package approved by </p><p>government (see septels - documentation </p><p>expected this week from the Ministry of </p><p>Finance) partially addressed several salient </p><p>issues such as the exchange rate, fuel prices, </p><p>and farmer producer prices for controlled food </p><p>commodities.  The UNHC also noted that </p><p>discussions were on-going on other issues </p><p>(e.g., GMB monopoly, joint monitoring of aid, </p><p>etc.). </p><p>- The UNHC also made the following </p><p>announcements: the Special U.N. Envoys\' recent </p><p>trip report focusing on HIV/AIDS impacts on </p><p>the food crisis is available (see reftel C); </p><p>no start date has yet been set for the joint </p><p>GOZ/UN commercial farming area survey, </p><p>although the questionnaire to be used has been </p><p>agreed upon; a Humanitarian Principles </p><p>workshop proposed for last week had been </p><p>postponed due to the unavailability of key GOZ </p><p>participants; and that a group was working on </p><p>plans for a major Humanitarian Roundtable for </p><p>Zimbabwe for March/April 2003. </p><p>- Finally, the UNHC noted that future such </p><p>joint UN/GOZ/Donor Meetings would be held </p><p>every three weeks (instead of bi-monthly), </p><p>with the next meeting scheduled for March 17. </p><p> </p><p>8. Comment: While this meeting demonstrated an </p><p>improved flow of information, much of what was </p><p>discussed was already known by most </p><p>participants, with little new information of </p><p>any serious import discussed.  However, the </p><p>meeting\'s dynamics suggest an increased ease </p><p>and familiarity of all parties with each other </p><p>and with the issues on the table.  It remains </p><p>to be seen, however, if the proposed strategy </p><p>of less frequent such meetings will produce </p><p>any more productive results.  SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
