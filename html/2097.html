<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 002710 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR INL AND AF </p><p>DEAHQS FOR OFE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/24/2011 </p><p>TAGS: SNAR, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NDLEA EXHIBITS GREATER DRUG ENFORCEMENT PROWESS </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA 2665 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter for reasons </p><p>1.5(b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.(C) Summary:  In two recent meetings with the </p><p>Ambassador, NDLEA Chairman Bello Lafiaji extolled </p><p>the drug enforcement agency\'s more energetic efforts. </p><p>Drug seizures made thus far already surpass last </p><p>year\'s totals and the NDLEA stands to receive increased </p><p>resources - both from the Federal government and INL - </p><p>to further fuel the Nigerian war on drugs.  The NDLEA is </p><p>also eager to improve its role in fighting money </p><p>laundering, but is learning its limits in attempting to </p><p>take on crimes beyond the realm of narcotics.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.(U) Ambassador Jeter, accompanied by POLCOUNS, RNLEO </p><p>and DEA Attache, called on NDLEA Chairman Bello Lafiaji </p><p>at NDLEA Headquarters in Lagos October 4.  Also </p><p>participating from the NDLEA were: Special Assistant </p><p>Usman Almali; Coordinator for International Affairs </p><p>Vicent Ossai;  Director for Money Laundering Tony Ray; </p><p>Director for Legal Affairs Femi Oloruntoba; and Director </p><p>for Investigations Aminu Shehu. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.(C) Lafiaji expressed condolences over September 11. </p><p>He he had just returned from an INTERPOL conference in Hungary </p><p>where delegates spent two days discussing ways the </p><p>international law enforcement community can better respond to </p><p>the threat of global terrorism. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Money Laundering </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.(C) The Ambassador raised USG concerns over Nigeria\'s </p><p>porous money laundering controls, concerns highlighted by </p><p>Washignton\'s effort to freeze the assets of </p><p>suspected terrorists around the world.  The FATF had </p><p>"decertified" Nigeria in June, not only for the GON\'s </p><p>failure to answer a questionnaire on Nigeria\'s money </p><p>laundering control regime, but for serious deficiencies </p><p>identified by the FATF review committee in Nigeria\'s </p><p>anti-money laundering performance.  (Comment: Post learned </p><p>October 16 that the GON responded to the FATF belatedly, </p><p>through an August 31 letter from the President\'s office. </p><p>End Comment). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.(C) Lafiaji acknowledged the FATF\'s assessment of </p><p>Nigeria\'s shortcomings in this area.  He pointed to the </p><p>existing anti-drug money laundering law, a 1995 decree, </p><p>and agreed its scope should be expanded to include the many </p><p>other avenues of money laundering in Nigeria (e.g. </p><p>corruption, trafficking in persons, fraud, and arms </p><p>trafficking).  To address this deficiency, the NDLEA has </p><p>drafted revisions to the law, he claimed.  Lafiaji asserted </p><p>the NDLEA should be the lead agency in coordinating </p><p>anti-money laundering activities.  Lafiaji did not agree with </p><p>our suggestion os a centralized agency specifically mandated </p><p>to coordinate and command this effort. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NDLEA Operations at Air and Sea Ports </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.(C) Applauding the NDLEA for its record seizure of </p><p>cocaine (60 kilograms) from a Brazilian freighter at the </p><p>Lagos sea port August 27, the Ambassador asked if the </p><p>NDLEA had obtained unrestricted port access.  Lafiaji </p><p>confirmed that, shortly after the large cocaine seizure, </p><p>President Obasanjo issued an executive order granting </p><p>the NDLEA unrestricted access to the Lagos ports. </p><p>Lafiaji has already chaired an interagency meeting with the </p><p>Nigerian Port Authority, Customs, Immigration and the State </p><p>Security Service (SSS) to work out the modalities for the </p><p>NDLEA\'s full operational role at the sea ports. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Airports at Abuja, Kano Vulnerable? </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.(C) The Chairman stated that traffickers appear to </p><p>targeting airports where drug enforcement efforts are </p><p>less vigorous.  The thrice-weekly British Airways flight </p><p>to London from Abuja and the thrice-weekly KLM flight to </p><p>Amsterdam from Kano appear to have become more attractive </p><p>to traffickers dues to the heightened NDLEA scutiny in </p><p>Lagos.  Neither airport has body x-ray or Itemiser </p><p>equipment to screen passengers and baggage for drugs. </p><p>The first drug seizure in over a year at the Kano </p><p>airport was made on September 26 - 450 grams of cocaine </p><p>injested by a passenger arriving on KLM from Curacao </p><p>(via Amsterdam). This serves as a warning to the NDLEA, </p><p>stated the Chairman, expressing his desire to place </p><p>one of the two new INL-funded Itemisers with the NDLEA </p><p>unit stationed at the Kano Airport. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.(C) The NDLEA has only a "skeletal staff" in Abuja and no </p><p>drug seizures have been made at the capital\'s airport, which </p><p>is cause for concern, implied Lafiaji.  He plans to bolster </p><p>staffing and would like to install the second new </p><p>Itemiser there. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEA Operational Concerns </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.(C) Ambassador Jeter cited his concern that the NDLEA </p><p>is not sharing enough information on its operations with the </p><p>DEA Lagos office.  As an example, the DEA Attache produced a </p><p>recent letter from the NDLEA reporting on significant drug </p><p>enforcement activity but neglecting some crucial details. </p><p>The DEA Attache also noted that he had not received monthly </p><p>reports of drug seizures and arrests since June.  Defensive </p><p>at first, Chairman Lafiaji instructe his staff to improve its </p><p>information-sharing with DEA. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>October 10: Lafiaji\'s Tenure at One Year </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.(C) Lafiaji sought a meeting with the Ambassador in </p><p>Abuja October 10; RNLEO sat in.  Noting that </p><p>he had completed a full year as NDLEA Chairman that very </p><p>day, Lafiaji highlighted several additional drug seizures </p><p>over last week. He also sought our support for his idea that </p><p>NDLEA should coordinate GON anti-money laundering efforts. </p><p>The news he reported included the first drug seizure made in </p><p>Lagos in connection with the South African Airways/Nigerian </p><p>Airways flight to New York -- almost one kilogram of cocaine </p><p>concealed in the clothing of a female Nigerian passenger </p><p>attempting to board the October 5 flight. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.(C) The NDLEA chief also reported another cocaine </p><p>seizure made at the Kano airport on October 8 -- 710 grams </p><p>carried internally by a male passenger also arriving from </p><p>Curacao on KLM via Amsterdam.  The Ambassador congratulated </p><p>Lafiaji on the interdictions but reiterated USG </p><p>concerns over the lack of evenly applied and well coordinated </p><p>anti-money laundering efforts in Nigeria.  A central </p><p>body with the authority (e.g. the Presidency) to command </p><p>disparate GON security agencies is essential to improve </p><p>this situation, Jeter noted.  RNLEO outlined the U.S. system </p><p>which has a central coordinating body and information </p><p>clearhouse (FINCEN) while the various agencies (e.g. DEA, </p><p>FBI, USSS) run their own money laundering and financial </p><p>crimes investigation units. Discussion of this topic </p><p>concluded with Lafiaji agreeing that the NDLEA need lose its </p><p>current focus on drug money laundering with the creation of a </p><p>national centralized authority. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13.(C) When first confronted with our serious money </p><p>laundering concerns following the tragic September 11 </p><p>bombings,  Lafiaji seemed determined in our October 5 meeting </p><p>to expand the NDLEA\'s jurisdiction, howver impractical, by </p><p>placing </p><p>it in the lead of all GON efforts to fight money laundering. </p><p>By October 18, however, his positions seems to have evolved to </p><p>an acceptance that a new federal entity - a la Financial </p><p>Crimes Commission - is needed to coordinate the GON\'s </p><p>anti-money laundering efforts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14.(C) The NDLEA seems to have improved its interdiction </p><p>efforts considerably, as shown by the increase level of </p><p>heroin and cocaine seized over last year.  All seizures </p><p>made to date seem authentic and we have been able to </p><p>keep closer watch on the statistical reporting.  This is </p><p>particularly noteworthy since we suspect, but have no </p><p>proff, that the NDLEA may have "padded" its CY2000 seizure </p><p>statistics during the last two months of the year.   With new </p><p>sea port access and greater federal resources employed, we </p><p>expect to see additional successes on the drug enforcement </p><p>front in the coming months. </p><p> </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
