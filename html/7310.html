Summary:  On an April 2-3 trip to northeastern Dolakha </p><p>district, PolOff and PolFSN met with civil servants, police </p><p>and local business owners.  The district has remained quiet </p><p>since the January 29 declaration of nationwide cease-fire, </p><p>though some non-violent Maoist activities continue.  Civil </p><p>servants are returning to most villages, and government </p><p>services are resuming, leading most locals to assume that </p><p>lasting peace is at hand.  Contacted sources said that </p><p>international pressure, internal dissatisfaction and supply </p><p>problems have contributed to the willingness of the Maoists </p><p>to negotiate.  Sources also stated that Maoist support in the </p><p>district derives exclusively from fear, and that </p><p>international pressure will be necessary to ensure that </p><p>Maoist leaders accept election results.  Hope for peace in </p><p>the district sometimes borders on desperation, and is coupled </p><p>with a strong anxiety about what to do with the now-armed </p><p>Maoist soldiers.  Local leaders say that Maoist cadres expect </p><p>to be absorbed into the Royal Nepal Army as part of any </p><p>eventual peace agreement.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>SECURITY SITUATION: LIVE AND LET LIVE </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) On April 2 and 3, PolOff and PolFSN met with </p><p>government leaders and business owners in northeastern </p><p>Dolakha district, seeking information about local conditions </p><p>since the January 29 declaration of a cease-fire between the </p><p>Government of Nepal (GON) and Maoist insurgents.  Prior to </p><p>the cease-fire, Dolakha had experienced a relatively high </p><p>level of Maoist activity for the Eastern region, though the </p><p>number of reported killings--approximately 50--is less than </p><p>in some surrounding districts.  All police posts but two were </p><p>destroyed in the seven-year insurgency, along with all post </p><p>offices.  The District Headquarters at Charikot was the </p><p>target of several small-scale attacks that damaged nearby </p><p>buildings.  In Jiri, the district\'s second largest town, </p><p>Maoists destroyed an MI-17 helicopter in a night-time raid, </p><p>shot and killed a political activist in the crowded central </p><p>market, and robbed the main bank in broad daylight.  In </p><p>October 2002, Maoists did approximately USD 1 million damage </p><p>to the Norwegian-financed Khimti Hydropower plant on the </p><p>district border (ref A).  The district\'s highways were the </p><p>scene of several attacks on civilian vehicles, including a </p><p>November 2002 landmine attack on a crowded passenger bus (ref </p><p>B) and a May 2002 attack on a Pepsi truck (ref C).  Sources </p><p>in Charikot (including GON civil servants, police and local </p><p>politicians and business leaders) indicated that Maoists have </p><p>often used Dolakha as a staging ground for attacks into </p><p>neighboring districts, because of its central location and </p><p>good roads. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Since the declaration of a nationwide cease-fire, the </p><p>local Maoists have been living in an uneasy truce with </p><p>government forces and the population.  There have been no </p><p>reported violations of the code of conduct, but according to </p><p>Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Thakur Ram Bartaula, </p><p>armed Maoist cadre still patrol some areas of the district in </p><p>combat dress, demanding food and shelter from villagers. </p><p>Police and Royal Nepal Army (RNA) personnel from the two </p><p>remaining police and army posts do not typically venture more </p><p>than 15-20 kilometers away from their post on patrol, </p><p>returning home each night and deliberately avoiding </p><p>Maoist-populated areas in order to preclude the possibility </p><p>of a clash that might upset the peace.  Activity by the </p><p>security forces has focused on preserving the </p><p>telecommunication infrastructure remaining in Charikot, and </p><p>on "dominating" the Jiri-Kathmandu highway.  Curfews have </p><p>been abolished. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) There are 17 suspected Maoists in police custody in </p><p>Charikot.  Representatives of INSEC, a human rights NGO </p><p>affiliated with the Communist Party of Nepal-United Marxist </p><p>Leninists (UML), insist that only a few are \'actual\' Maoists, </p><p>and the rest are either unfortunate villagers who were </p><p>coerced into Maoist activity, or are simple cases of mistaken </p><p>identity.  In one case, the human rights group alleges, a </p><p>woman has been jailed for 14 months because her husband is a </p><p>known Maoist.  No charges have been filed against any of the </p><p>detainees. </p><p> </p><p>MAOISTS HOLD MASS MEETINGS, </p><p>CONTINUE EXTORTION </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Bartaula reported that Maoists have held several mass </p><p>meetings since the start of the cease-fire.  Police </p><p>intelligence suggests that the meetings have been attended by </p><p>Maoist supporters, criminals, locals dissatisfied with their </p><p>own political parties and some villagers afraid of </p><p>retribution if they do not attend. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Some businesses, schools and travelers have reported </p><p>continued Maoist extortion after the cease-fire, but others </p><p>have been successful in refusing to pay.  One hotel owner </p><p>explained that when a Maoist asked him for a "donation," he </p><p>simply stated that such things weren\'t allowed under the </p><p>cease-fire.  Even before the truce, some organizations in </p><p>Dolakha had managed to negotiate their own agreements with </p><p>the Maoists.  A large technical school in Jiri remained open </p><p>throughout the State of Emergency by convincing local Maoist </p><p>commanders that the practical training they offer is the type </p><p>of education the Maoists should support.  A community school </p><p>in the same town, established by parents when the local </p><p>private boarding school was forced to close by the </p><p>insurgents, came to much the same arrangement.  A </p><p>U.S.-affiliated medical research station got Maoist </p><p>"permission" to remain open because their clinic provides </p><p>free services to villagers. </p><p> </p><p>GOVERNMENT SERVICES RETURNING TO VILLAGES </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) Chief District Officer (CDO) Chandeshwore Acharya </p><p>told PolOff that most Village Development Committee (VDC) </p><p>Secretaries who had taken shelter in Charikot have returned </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>to their villages.  (Note:  VDCs are the smallest unit of </p><p>local government. End note.)  Those secretaries whose VDCs </p><p>are heavily populated by Maoists remain in the District </p><p>Headquarters.  Almost all teachers have returned to their </p><p>schools and are holding classes, though Acharya suspects that </p><p>some teachers may be paying extortion money to the Maoists in </p><p>order to stay at their posts.  Programs such as family </p><p>planning clinics, distribution of government funds to the </p><p>elderly and agricultural development assistance have returned </p><p>to some VDCs.  Mail service reportedly has been restored in </p><p>all VDCs, though not all postal buildings have been rebuilt. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) Though road construction projects continued </p><p>throughout the State of Emergency, other development work had </p><p>been stalled by the lack of government representatives in </p><p>villages.  According to Local Development Officer (LDO) Gopi </p><p>Khanal, work has resumed on conservation, telecommunication, </p><p>microenterprise and other projects throughout the district. </p><p>On April 2, the Local Development Office was full of </p><p>applicants for volunteer positions as project coordinators. </p><p> </p><p>POLITICAL OPINION DIVIDED </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU) The Charikot office of the UML has organized a </p><p>"Campaign for Peace and Democracy," a road show of joint </p><p>meetings including speeches by both UML and Maoist local </p><p>leaders.  Though UML representatives told PolOff that they </p><p>had "pressed the Maoists very hard" on their record of </p><p>violence and terrorism, INSEC representatives who attended </p><p>one of the organized meetings said that Maoist commanders </p><p>refused to apologize for their activities during the </p><p>insurgency.  "Whatever we did, we did," the local commander </p><p>reportedly stated in a speech at the event. "That was all </p><p>during the war, and we\'re not going to apologize." </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU) When asked how local UML representatives viewed </p><p>the decision of their party\'s central leadership to talk with </p><p>Maoist ideologue Baburam Bhattarai, given the kidnapping, </p><p>torture and murder of several UML party workers in Dolakha, </p><p>UML local party secretary Ananda Pokharel attributed the move </p><p>to "diplomatic relations."  The UML wants to convince the </p><p>Maoists to give up violence in favor of politics, he said. </p><p>Rather than ostracizing the insurgents, the UML wants to </p><p>provide "a warm lap" into which the rebels can climb. </p><p>Pokharel also called on the King to work together with </p><p>political parties in order to preserve democracy.  "The </p><p>parties are coming together," in his estimation, "but there </p><p>is still a big gap between the Palace and the parties.  The </p><p>King should come a little bit down to us." </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU) Not all local representatives were as supportive of </p><p>policies from Kathmandu. In Jiri, where politicians are also </p><p>hotel owners and trekking guides, Nepali Congress (NC) and </p><p>UML representatives were openly critical of their parties\' </p><p>leaders.  "The leadership may blame the King for their </p><p>problems, but they caused their own troubles by not getting </p><p>along, and by focusing too much on the (Prime Minister\'s) </p><p>chair," said a former VDC representative for Nepali Congress. </p><p>"Here in Jiri, at election time, we all have our own flags </p><p>and our own slogans, and there are differences among us.  But </p><p>after the election, we come together to work for the good of </p><p>the people.  If the politicians at the center can\'t figure </p><p>that out, they should come here and learn from us."  Other </p><p>local leaders of the predominantly UML town nodded in </p><p>agreement. "Peace is the most important thing," said one. </p><p>"People don\'t care about an all-party government or </p><p>restoration of the former Parliament.  They just want to be </p><p>able to run their businesses and move around freely." </p><p> </p><p>LOCALS LIVE IN FEAR, HOPE FOR PEACE </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  (U)  The cease-fire has raised hopes that peace is on </p><p>the horizon.  People in Jiri are pleased to see tourists </p><p>passing through again, and children in Charikot feel safe </p><p>enough to walk through town at night.  With peace potentially </p><p>so close, the thought of returning to the curfews and terror </p><p>that existed prior to the cease-fire is not something that </p><p>the people of Dolakha care to contemplate.  "The peace talks </p><p>have to succeed," said DSP Bartaula, echoing the sentiments </p><p>of government workers and private businessmen alike.  "There </p><p>is simply no other option." </p><p> </p><p>13.  (SBU) Nevertheless, some villagers have been slow to </p><p>leave the safety of the District Headquarters to return to </p><p>their farms.  Maoist commanders in the region reportedly have </p><p>told villagers that they will be safe if they return home, </p><p>but few people trust their motives.  According to contacted </p><p>sources, fear is the insurgents\' only source of support. </p><p>"People in Dolakha support the Maoists not from the heart, </p><p>but because of their guns," said LDO Khanal. "If they </p><p>surrender their guns, only one or two percent of the </p><p>population will support them."  Local UML leadership agreed. </p><p>"If you take away their guns, the Maoists won\'t get a single </p><p>seat in any election," said Ananda Pokharel. "Their support </p><p>is based only on fear." </p><p> </p><p>DOLAKHA\'S MAOISTS FACE PRESSURE </p><p>FROM INSIDE AND OUT </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  (U) When asked why the Maoists have elected to pursue </p><p>peace talks, all respondents cited growing international </p><p>pressure as the primary impetus toward a cease-fire.  They </p><p>also said that continued pressure would be necessary in order </p><p>to ensure that the Maoists accept the results of democratic </p><p>elections. </p><p> </p><p>15.  (C) In addition, internal pressure may have played a </p><p>role in forcing the Maoists to seek a settlement.  According </p><p>to DSP Bartaula, police intelligence sources have reported </p><p>food problems and financial problems among the Maoists. </p><p>Local villagers are simply running out of resources to </p><p>extort.  At the same time, said the DSP, the improved </p><p>standard of living of some Maoist commanders has caused a </p><p>great deal of resentment among the rank and file.  The only </p><p>Maoist leader to be killed in the district bought a farm and </p><p>started building a house shortly before his death.  Most </p><p>locals believe that he was subsequently killed by his own </p><p>dissatisfied troops. </p><p> </p><p>PROBLEMS APLENTY IF PEACE BREAKS OUT </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>16.  (SBU) Though they assume that peace is necessary and </p><p>therefore a given, local leaders are quick to point out a </p><p>host of problems that may arise in the future.  Of primary </p><p>concern is the fact that the rank and file Maoists in Dolakha </p><p>are convinced that if there is a permanent cessation of </p><p>hostilities, they will be given positions in the Royal Nepal </p><p>Army.  The CDO\'s office has seen a sharp increase in the </p><p>number of Maoists requesting citizenship cards, presumably </p><p>for eventual enlistment.  According to INSEC, most villagers </p><p>are equally convinced.  Their concern is not whether the </p><p>Maoists will be brought into the RNA, but rather how the </p><p>reorganization will be accomplished.  "If the Maoist army is </p><p>just left as it is," warned the INSEC representatives, "peace </p><p>will not come smoothly." </p><p> </p><p>17.  (C)  It won\'t come smoothly for a number of reasons, </p><p>according to contacted sources.  One possibility is that some </p><p>Maoists simply may not obey orders to stop fighting; another </p><p>is that some Maoists may keep their weapons and turn to a </p><p>life of crime.  "The economy is hard in Dolakha," said the </p><p>CDO.  "A Maoist without a rifle has no chance to make a </p><p>living here at all.  But once he has a gun, he can get a lot </p><p>of things."  Maoists who stop fighting will face problems </p><p>other than economic, say police and human rights activists. </p><p>Those who were directly involved in extortion, kidnappings </p><p>and murder will be recognized, and may face retribution.  DSP </p><p>Bartaula asked one Maoist prisoner why his brother, a local </p><p>unit commander, hadn\'t returned to his village following the </p><p>cease-fire.  The prisoner reportedly replied, "He used to </p><p>bring 40 or 50 Maoists there to eat all the food.  If he goes </p><p>back now, they\'ll break his legs." </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>18.  (C)  Local leaders in Dolakha are firm in their belief </p><p>that the Maoists are serious about pursuing lasting peace. </p><p>The police seem certain that if they can just prolong the </p><p>cease-fire, the insurgency must necessarily come to an end. </p><p>However, most of the basis for this strongly held view </p><p>appears to come from nothing but the intense desire for it to </p><p>be true.  Rumors of supply problems and dissatisfaction among </p><p>the Maoist soldiers, while offering some insight into </p><p>difficulties faced by the insurgents, do not prove that they </p><p>have lost their ability or their will to fight. </p><p>Nevertheless, the only problem that the local leaders were </p><p>interested in discussing was what to do with the Maoist cadre </p><p>when the war is over. </p><p> </p><p>19.  (C) The deliberate optimism in this northeastern </p><p>district, like the optimism in much of Nepal, is occasionally </p><p>tinged with a bit of desperation.  "The peace talks must </p><p>succeed this time," is repeated like a mantra to ward off the </p><p>unspeakable-- the possibility that they might indeed fail. </p><p>If the Maoists really are as weary of war as the citizens of </p><p>Dolakha, and if the leaders of both sides take heed of that </p><p>fact, then there is every possibility that peace talks may </p><p>succeed.  If they fail, then whoever is to blame will have a </p><p>very hard time explaining himself to the people of Dolakha. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
