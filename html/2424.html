<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 PRETORIA 000506 </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR AF FRONT OFFICE AND AF/S </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY; PARIS FOR WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/28/2012 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, EAID, PREL, SF, CA </p><p>SUBJECT: THE NEW PARTNERSHIP FOR AFRICA\'S DEVELOPMENT </p><p>(NEPAD):  MOVING FORWARD </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: ECONOMIC M/C ROBERT F. GODEC, REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C)  SUMMARY:  ECONOFF MET JANUARY 24 WITH DAVID </p><p>MALCOLMSON, DFA NEPAD COORDINATOR, TO REVIEW RECENT </p><p>DEVELOPMENTS IN THE EVOLUTION OF THE NEPAD PROGRAM.  AT THE </p><p>JANUARY 24-27 CONFERENCE IN BENONI, SOUTH AFRICA AIMED TO </p><p>MOVE BEYOND SLOGANS TO FORGE AGREEMENT ON CONCRETE PLANS AND </p><p>NATIONAL COMMITMENTS TO PUSH NEPAD FORWARD.  THE FIVE </p><p>PRIORITY AREAS APPROVED BY THE NEPAD HEADS OF STATE </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION COMMITTEE LAST OCTOBER WILL BE THE CONTEXT IN </p><p>WHICH THIS EFFORT WILL PROCEED.  THE GOAL IS TO REACH </p><p>AGREEMENT ON A PROGRAM THAT CAN BE PRESENTED TO THE G8 SUMMIT </p><p>IN CANADA NEXT JUNE AND TO THE INITIAL AFRICAN UNION (AU) </p><p>SUMMIT NEXT JULY IN DURBAN.  SOUTH AFRICA HAS EMBARKED ON A </p><p>PROGRAM TO ENLIST SUPPORT FOR NEPAD FROM BUSINESS AND OTHER </p><p>ELEMENTS OF CIVIL SOCIETY.  PRESIDENT MBEKI ADDRESSED THE </p><p>BENONI CONFERENCE AND ENCOURAGED AFRICANS TO BECOME </p><p>"PROACTIVE IMPLEMENTERS OF OUR OWN SUSTAINED DEVELOPMENT." </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) ECONOFF MET JANUARY 24 WITH DAVID MALCOLMSON, DFA </p><p>NEPAD COORDINATOR, TO REVIEW RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE NEPAD </p><p>PROCESS, INCLUDING GOALS FOR THE WORK-IN-PROGRESS REVIEW </p><p>WORKSHOP HELD JANUARY 24-27 IN BENONI, SOUTH AFRICA.  HE </p><p>DESCRIBED THE BENONI CONFERENCE AS THE BEGINNING OF THE </p><p>"SECOND PHASE" OF THE NEPAD DEVELOPMENT PROCESS.  MALCOLMSON </p><p>UNDERSCORED THE NEED TO MOVE AHEAD TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF </p><p>MECHANISMS AND PROGRAMS THAT WILL TRANSLATE NOW "THEORETICAL" </p><p>ISSUES OF GOVERNANCE, ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT AND SELF-RELIANCE </p><p>INTO CONCRETE PLANS AND COMMITMENTS.  ONLY AGREEMENT BY </p><p>PARTICIPATING AFRICAN COUNTRIES ON A CREDIBLE PROGRAM OF </p><p>ACTION WILL DEFLECT CRITICISM THAT THE NEPAD PROCESS HAS BEEN </p><p>OVERLY AMBITIOUS IN ITS AIMS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) THE HEADS OF STATE IMPLEMENTATION COMMITTEE MEETING </p><p>LAST OCTOBER 23 APPROVED A MANDATE FOCUSING ON FIVE PRIORITY </p><p>AREAS FOR NEPAD: 1) PEACE AND SECURITY, 2) ECONOMIC AND </p><p>CORPORATE GOVERNANCE, 3) BANKING AND FINANCIAL STANDARDS, 4) </p><p>INFRASTRUCTURE AND 5) MARKET ACCESS AND AGRICULTURE.  IN </p><p>ADDITION, HEADS OF STATE APPROVED THE CREATION OF A CONFLICT </p><p>PREVENTION AND RESOLUTION SUBCOMMITTEE, TO BE CHAIRED BY </p><p>PRESIDENT MBEKI.  THE GOAL OF THE BENONI WORKSHOP IS TO </p><p>ARTICULATE AN OUTLINE AND DETAILED CONTENT FOR A NEPAD </p><p>PROGRAM OF ACTION THAT CAN BE PRESENTED TO THE G8 SUMMIT IN </p><p>CANADA NEXT JUNE AND TO THE AFRICAN UNION (AU) SUMMIT IN </p><p>DURBAN NEXT JULY.  THE WORKSHOP WILL ALSO DISCUSS HOW NEPAD, </p><p>AS THE AGREED-UPON OVERALL DEVELOPMENT FRAMEWORK FOR AFRICA, </p><p>CAN ENHANCE AFRICAN PARTICIPATION IN THE FINANCING FOR </p><p>DEVELOPMENT CONFERENCE IN MEXICO AND AT THE WORLD SUMMIT ON </p><p>SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IN JOHANNESBURG. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) MALCOLMSON SAID THE CURRENT NEPAD MANAGEMENT </p><p>STRUCTURES (THE IMPLEMENTATION AND STEERING COMMITTEES AS </p><p>WELL AS THE SECRETARIAT) ARE LIKELY TO ENDURE FOR SOME TIME </p><p>AFTER THE AFRICAN UNION COMES INTO BEING AT THE JULY SUMMIT. </p><p>HE AGREED THAT THE AU WILL LIKELY BE CONSUMED, AT LEAST OVER </p><p>THE SHORT-TERM, WITH THE DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF ITS OWN </p><p>POLITICAL ARCHITECTURE.  THE SUBSTANCE OF COORDINATING, </p><p>MONITORING AND DRIVING THE NEPAD PROCESS WILL HAVE TO REMAIN </p><p>IN THE HANDS OF THE CURRENT DEDICATED MECHANISMS.  HE NOTED </p><p>AS WELL THAT THE OLD OAU TRADITION OF CONSENSUS SEEKING WOULD </p><p>DO LITTLE TO PROVIDE THE FORCEFUL IMPETUS THAT NEPAD NEEDS. </p><p>HE ALSO CONCEDED THAT THERE ARE SOME OAU (AND FUTURE AU) </p><p>MEMBERS THAT THE CURRENT NEPAD GOVERNMENTS WOULD LIKE TO SEE </p><p>REMAIN ON THE SIDELINES.  HE CITED THE PEER REVIEW MECHANISM </p><p>IN NEPAD AS A SIGNIFICANT DEPARTURE FROM THE WAY THE OAU HAS </p><p>DONE BUSINESS IN THE PAST, I.E. TAKING PAINS TO AVOID EVEN </p><p>THE APPEARANCE OF INFRINGING UPON THE SOVEREIGNTY OF MEMBER </p><p>STATES.  NEPAD, FOR THOSE STATES WHO DECIDE TO PARTICIPATE, </p><p>WILL BE MUCH MORE INTERVENTIONIST IN CHARACTER. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) MALCOLMSON TOOK NOTE OF CRITICISM THAT THE CREATION </p><p>OF NEPAD HAS BEEN A TOP-DOWN, TECHNOCRATIC PROCESS WITHOUT </p><p>MUCH INPUT FROM CIVIL SOCIETY IN THE EARLY DEBATES ON THE </p><p>PROGRAM\'S STRUCTURE.  THIS IN SPITE OF THE DOCUMENT ITSELF, </p><p>WHICH NOTES THAT "THE AGENDA IS BASED ON NATIONAL AND </p><p>REGIONAL PRIORITIES AND DEVELOPMENT PLANS THAT MUST BE </p><p>PREPARED THROUGH PARTICIPATIVE PROCESSES INVOLVING THE </p><p>PEOPLE."  SOME CRITICS HAVE UNDERSCORED THAT THE DEBATE </p><p>AROUND GOVERNANCE STANDARDS WILL HAVE TO BE WIDENED WITH MORE </p><p>"BUY IN" BY AFFECTED GROUPS, LEST THE ENTIRE PROJECT "START </p><p>AND END AND FAIL WITH LEADERSHIP."  MALCOLMSON AGREED THAT </p><p>THIS HAS BEEN A "POLITICALLY DRIVEN PROCESS" FROM THE OUTSET </p><p>(MOSTLY OUT OF NECESSITY IN ORDER TO GET IT STARTED), BUT </p><p>ADDED THAT SOUTH AFRICA HAS INSTITUTED A MARKETING AND </p><p>COMMUNICATIONS STRATEGY AIMED AT BRINGING BUSINESS, CIVIL </p><p>SOCIETY AND OTHERS INTO THE PICTURE.  THIS OUTREACH EFFORT </p><p>INCLUDES THE BENONI CONFERENCE, TO WHICH A VARIETY OF </p><p>NON-GOVERNMENT GROUPS WERE INVITED. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) IN HIS REMARKS TO THE BENONI MEETING, PRESIDENT MBEKI </p><p>ENCOURAGED AFRICANS TO BE "AGENTS FOR CHANGE" AND TO "TAKE </p><p>OWNERSHIP" OF THEIR FUTURES.  HE ASSERTED THAT THE WORK </p><p>CARRIED OUT BY AFRICAN HEADS OF STATE IN PROMOTING THE NEPAD </p><p>AGENDA "HAS SUCCEEDED IN GENERATING HOPE AND CONFIDENCE IN </p><p>THE FUTURE OF OUR CONTINENT AND IN ATTAINING ACCEPTANCE OF </p><p>NEPAD AS A POLICY FRAMEWORK INFORMING THE WAY THEY VIEW </p><p>AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT."  HE WELCOMED THE PARTICIPATION IN THE </p><p>CONFERENCE BY REPRESENTATIVES OF THE AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT </p><p>BANK, THE DEVELOPMENT BANK OF SOUTHERN AFRICA, THE ECONOMIC </p><p>COMMISSION FOR AFRICA AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS AS WELL.  HE </p><p>ENCOURAGED THE CONFEREES TO WORK OUT "CONCRETE IMPLEMENTABLE </p><p>PLANS" THAT WILL DEMONSTRATE THAT AFRICANS ARE BEING </p><p>"PROACTIVE IMPLEMENTERS OF OUR OWN SUSTAINED DEVELOPMENT." </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) COMMENT: MALCOLMSON WAS CANDID ABOUT SOME OF THE </p><p>DIFFICULTIES THAT SOUTH AFRICA, AS ONE OF NEPAD\'S "FOUNDING </p><p>STATES," HAS HAD IN BRINGING THIS PROGRAM TO ITS PRESENT </p><p>STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT.  OUTSIZED EGOS AND OBSTRUCTIONIST </p><p>BEHAVIOR FROM SOME COUNTRIES HAVE REQUIRED A SUSTAINED AND </p><p>DETERMINED POLITICAL-LEVEL PUSH IN ORDER TO KEEP NEPAD ON </p><p>TRACK.  HE CONCEDED THAT NEPAD\'S CREDIBILITY (AND VIABILITY) </p><p>WILL DEPEND ON PRESENTING A SOLID AND DOABLE PROGRAM TO G8 </p><p>COUNTRIES.  THE CAPE TOWN MEETING OF G8 PERSONAL </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES IN FEBRUARY WILL BE AN IMPORTANT INDICATOR OF </p><p>WHETHER THE BENONI CONFERENCE SUCCEEDED IN MOVING THE NEPAD </p><p>PROCESS BEYOND PLATITUDES TO A PROGRAM THAT WILL ATTRACT </p><p>SUPPORT FROM WESTERN GOVERNMENTS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HUME </p><p></p></div>
