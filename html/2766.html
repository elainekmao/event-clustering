(SBU) SUMMARY:  PLAIN WHITE CROSSES DREW THE </p><p>ATTENTION OF CONGEN OFFICERS AS WE DROVE THROUGH THE </p><p>CENTRAL HIGHLAND PROVINCE OF DAK LAK. A COFFEE BREAK IN </p><p>NHAN CO COMMUNE IN DAK LAP DISTRICT ALLOWED FOR CASUAL </p><p>CONVERSATION WITH SEVERAL OF THE VILLAGERS.  LOCAL </p><p>SECURITY OFFICERS KEPT INSERTING THEMSELVES INTO OUR </p><p>CONVERSATIONS, BUT THE VILLAGERS PAID THEM NO MIND. </p><p>BACK ON THE ROAD, OUR "ESCORTS" KEPT PACE ALMOST UNTIL </p><p>THE PROVINCIAL BORDER. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) CG, CONOFF AND FSN POL/ECON ASSISTANT DROVE BACK </p><p>TO HO CHI MINH CITY FROM DAK LAK\'S CAPITAL CITY, BUON </p><p>ME THUOT, ON THE NEW HIGHWAY 14.  LARGE, PLAIN WHITE </p><p>CROSSES OVER THE DOORWAYS OF SEVERAL HOUSES ON THE NEW </p><p>HIGHWAY DREW OUR ATTENTION. </p><p>3. (SBU) CONGENOFFS STOPPED AT A COFFEE STALL NEXT TO A </p><p>HOUSE WITH A WHITE CROSS OVER THE ENTRY, IN WHICH </p><p>CATHOLIC RELIGIOUS ARTIFACTS WERE PLAINLY VISIBLE </p><p>THROUGH THE WINDOWS AND DOORWAY.  THE OWNER OF THE </p><p>COFFEE STALL GREETED US IN RUSTY ENGLISH, SAYING HE HAD </p><p>LEARNED THE LANGUAGE FROM HIS "MANY AMERICAN FRIENDS IN </p><p>THE PAST."  HE IDENTIFIED HIMSELF AS ALSO THE OWNER OF </p><p>THE HOUSE NEXT DOOR. (NOTE: IN SUBSEQUENT CONVERSATION </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HO CHI  00390  01 OF 02  160854Z </p><p>IN VIETNAMESE, THE MAN\'S ACCENT SUGGESTED HE ORIGINALLY </p><p>CAME FROM NORTHERN VIETNAM, AND MOVED SOUTH DURING THE </p><p>1954 MASS INTERNAL MIGRATION. HIS REMARKS INDICATED </p><p>THAT HE MIGHT HAVE WORKED FOR THE U.S. MILITARY OR AN </p><p>AMERICAN BUSINESS BEFORE 1975.) </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) CONVERSATION WAS INTERRUPTED WHEN THREE MEN </p><p>ARRIVED BY MOTORBIKE AND SAT DOWN AT THE CAFE\'S OTHER </p><p>TABLE.  THE CAFE OWNER IMMEDIATELY WENT TO WAIT ON THE </p><p>NEWCOMERS, ASKING IF THEY "HAD COME ON BUSINESS."  THE </p><p>MEN REPLIED THEY WERE JUST STOPPING FOR COFFEE, BUT IT </p><p>WAS CLEAR THEY WERE PLAINCLOTHES SECURITY OFFICIALS </p><p>MONITORING THE PRESENCE OF FOREIGNERS IN THEIR COMMUNE. </p><p>THE CAFE OWNER JOINED THE MEN AT THEIR TABLE, BUT DID </p><p>NOT SEEM CONCERNED ABOUT OUR PRESENCE.  HE DIRECTED </p><p>OCCASIONAL COMMENTS TOWARD CG FROM THE OTHER TABLE.  HE </p><p>WAS DELIGHTED WHEN CONOFF ASKED TO TAKE PHOTOS OF HIS </p><p>HOUSE AND THE CROSS. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) CONGEN GROUP PROCEEDED FURTHER UP THE ROAD AND </p><p>WAS INVITED INTO AN EQUIPMENT AND VEHICLE REPAIR SHOP </p><p>WITH A CROSS OVER ITS DOORWAY. THE OWNERS WERE A MIDDLE- </p><p>AGED COUPLE WITH 10 GROWN CHILDREN. THEY OPENLY </p><p>DISPLAYED LARGE POSTERS OF POPE JOHN PAUL II, AN ALTAR </p><p>WITH THE VIRGIN MARY, AND STATUES OF SEVERAL SAINTS </p><p>SURROUNDED BY CANDLES.  THE WIFE SAID THE FAMILY WAS </p><p>CATHOLIC AND ATTENDED A CHURCH 80 KILOMETERS AWAY.  THE </p><p>COUPLE SAID THAT THERE WAS A PROTESTANT CHURCH ABOUT </p><p>NINE KILOMETERS AWAY, LOCATED OFF THE MAIN HIGHWAY. </p><p>THE FAMILY MOVED TO NHAN CO COMMUNE SEVEN YEARS EARLIER </p><p>WHEN THE AREA WAS MUCH MORE SPARSELY SETTLED.  FROM </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HO CHI  00390  01 OF 02  160854Z </p><p>BUON ME THUOT SEVEN YEARS AGO BECAUSE OF TOUGH ECONOMIC </p><p>CONDITIONS???, BUT THE WIFE NOTED LIFE IN NHAN CO </p><p>COMMUNE WAS WORSE.  SHE CITING DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES, </p><p>THE WIFE MADE AN OPEN PLEA FOR ASSISTANCE TO THE </p><p>COMMUNE - CLOTHING, SCHOOL SUPPLIES, ETC.  ABOUT TEN </p><p>MINUTES INTO THAT CONVERSATION, A MAN ENTERED THE SHOP- </p><p>CUM-HOUSE AND SAT DOWN AT THE TABLE WITHOUT SAYING A </p><p>WORD.  THE COUPLE DID NOT INTRODUCE THE NEWCOMER, NOR </p><p>DID THE MAN GREET CONGENOFFS.  HE APPEARED TO BE </p><p>ANOTHER NON-UNIFORMED SECURITY OFFICER, CHECKING UP ON </p><p>OUR ACTIVITIES IN THE VILLAGE. </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) CONGENOFFS RETURNED TO THEIR VEHICLES AND </p><p>CONTINUED DOWN HIGHWAY 14, FOLLOWED BY A CAR THAT HAD </p><p>BEEN PARKED IN THE VILLAGE. ABOUT 40 MINUTES LATER, </p><p>WHEN CONGENOFFS STOPPED FOR LUNCH, THE THREE MEN IN THE </p><p>CAR FOLLOWED US INTO THE RESTAURANT AND MAINTAINED </p><p>THEIR WATCH THROUGHOUT THE MEAL.  IT WAS OBVIOUS THEY </p><p>WERE PLAINCLOTHES SECURITY OFFICERS WHEN THEY HEADED </p><p>FOR THEIR CAR AFTER WATCHING US PAY THE BILL.  WHAT </p><p>THEY DID NOT KNOW WAS THAT WE PLANNED TO EAT A </p><p>WATERMELON WE HAD PURCHASED EARLIER FOR DESSERT.  WHEN </p><p>THE SECURITY OFFICERS NOTICED WE HAD NOT LEFT THE </p><p>RESTAURANT RIGHT AFTER THEM, THEY HAD TO SEND ONE MAN </p><p>BACK ON THE PRETEXT OF NOT HAVING FINISHED DRINKING ALL </p><p>HIS SODA.  BUT AFTER CONFIRMING CONGENOFFS HAD FINISHED </p><p>DESSERT, GOTTEN INTO THEIR VAN, AND WERE DRIVING TOWARD </p><p>THE BORDER (ONLY TWO MILES AWAY), THE OFFICIALS DID NOT </p><p>FOLLOW. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) COMMENT: A NOT-VERY-SUBTLE, BUT NOT-TOO- </p><p>INTRUSIVE PRESENCE OF PLAINCLOTHES SECURITY IS A </p><p>REGULAR PART OF CONGEN VISITS TO THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS. </p><p>BY STOPPING ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT IN NHAN CO </p><p>COMMUNE, CONGENOFFS WERE STRUCK BY THE OPENNESS OF </p><p>CATHOLICISM (WHICH IS A RECOGNIZED RELIGION IN VIETNAM) </p><p>AND THE VILLAGERS\' NONCHALANCE TOWARD THE LOCAL </p><p>SECURITY PRESENCE. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) AT THE SAME TIME, WE WERE SURPRISED BY THE </p><p>DEPTH OF SECURITY RESOURCES -- EVEN IN REMOTE NHAN CO </p><p>COMMUNE.  THREE DIFFERENT THREE DIFFERENT VEHICLES </p><p>FOLLOWED US AT DIFFERENT TIMES DURING THE THREE-HOUR </p><p>DRIVE THROUGH DAK LAK PROVINCE.  SEVEN DIFFERENT </p><p>PLAINCLOTHES OFFICERS (NOT COUNTING THE SOLDIERS WHO </p><p>CRUISED UP AND DOWN HIGHWAY 14, DOING U-TURNS TO </p><p>ALTERNATELY FOLLOW US OR PASS US GOING THE OPPOSITE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HO CHI  00390  02 OF 02  160854Z </p><p>WAY) MADE THEIR APPEARANCES AT THE COFFEE STALL, REPAIR </p><p>SHOP, AND LUNCH RESTAURANT.  THE PLAINCLOTHES SECURITY </p><p>DID NOT OVERTLY INTERFERE IN ANY WAY.  IN FACT A COUPLE </p><p>OF THEM SEEMED DOWNRIGHT SHEEPISH AS THEY EAVESDROPPED </p><p>ON SOME OF OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH VILLAGERS.  WHAT IS </p><p>CLEAR, HOWEVER, IS THAT SOMEBODY - EITHER THE GVN OR </p><p>THE PROVINCIAL AUTHORITIES - WILL SPARE NO EXPENSE OR </p><p>MANPOWER IN KEEPING TABS ON CONGEN MOVEMENTS IN THE </p><p>CENTRAL HIGHLANDS.
