<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 04 HARARE 002310 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DCHA/OFDA FOR KHANDAGLE, BORNS, AND MARX </p><p>DCHA/FFP FOR LANDIS, BRAUSE, SKORIC, AND PETERSON </p><p>AFR/SA FOR POE, FORT AND MARJORIE COPSON </p><p>AFR/SD FOR ISRALOW AND WHELAN </p><p>STATE FOR AF/S DELISI AND RAYNOR </p><p>STATE/INR FOR LESLIE CURTIN AND WILLIAM WOOD </p><p>NAIROBI FOR DCHA/OFDA/ARO FOR RILEY AND MYER, </p><p>REDSO/ESA/FFP FOR SENYKOFF </p><p>NSC FOR DWORKIN </p><p>PRETORIA FOR DCHA/FFP DISKIN, DCHA/OFDA BRYAN, AND </p><p>USDA/FAS HELM </p><p>ROME FOR LAVELLE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAID, EAGR, PGOV, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: FARM WORKERS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  THE EFFECTS OF GOVERNMENT MACROECONOMIC POLICIES </p><p>INHIBITING CROP PRODUCTION, IMPORTS, AND EQUITABLE </p><p>DISTRIBUTION AND MARKETING, COMBINED WITH LOWER THAN </p><p>AVERAGE RAINFALL, HAVE RAISED THE SPECTER OF FAMINE IN </p><p>ZIMBABWE.  UP TO 1.5 MILLION EX-COMMERCIAL FARM WORKERS </p><p>AND THEIR FAMILIES ARE CURRENTLY OR COULD SOON BE IN </p><p>VULNERABLE, AND FACE POSSIBLY LIFE THREATENING </p><p>CIRCUMSTANCES DUE TO FARM EXPROPRIATIONS IN ZIMBABWE </p><p>WHICH HAVE FREQUENTLY BEEN ACCOMPANIED BY VIOLENT </p><p>INVASIONS. MANY EX-FARM WORKERS\' VULNERABLE SITUATIONS </p><p>ARE EXACERBATED BY THE POLITICAL TENSIONS ASSOCIATED </p><p>WITH FARM EXPROPRIATIONS, AND MINIMAL HUMANITARIAN </p><p>ASSISTANCE IS BEING PROVIDED TO EX-FARM WORKERS BECAUSE </p><p>OF A LACK OF QUALIFIED IMPLEMENTING PARTNERS IN </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARM AREAS AND POLITICAL TENSIONS ASSOCIATED </p><p>IN WORKING WITH EX-FARM WORKERS. WHILE COPING MECHANISMS </p><p>AND SEVERANCE PACKAGES MAY SUSTAIN EX-FARM WORKERS IN </p><p>MASHONALAND AND MANICALAND FOR ANOTHER FEW MONTHS, THE </p><p>INABILITY TO OBTAIN SUFFICIENT FOOD IN MANY AFFECTED </p><p>AREAS WILL EVENTUALLY FORCE PEOPLE TO MOVE. THERE IS </p><p>DOCUMENTED AND ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE THAT INCREASING </p><p>NUMBERS OF EX-FARM WORKERS ARE ON THE MOVE. WHILE MOST </p><p>EX-FARM WORKERS WILL PROBABLY RELOCATE TO URBAN AREAS IN </p><p>ZIMBABWE, THERE MAY BE INCREASING NUMBERS OF DISPLACED </p><p>LEAVING FOR NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES.  OFDA/RA BELIEVES </p><p>THAT THE MIGRATION TO CITIES AND TOWNS WILL INTENSIFY </p><p>SOON, WITH VERY NOTICEABLE INCREASES BY JANUARY.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>GENERAL IDP SITUATION </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. A TEAM COMPOSED OF A USAID/DCHA/OFDA EMERGENCY </p><p>DISASTER RESPONSE COORDINATOR AND INFORMATION OFFICER </p><p>TRAVELED TO ZIMBABWE FROM OCTOBER 6-9 TO MEET WITH </p><p>USAID/ZIMBABWE AND THE USAID/DCHA/OFDA HUMANITARIAN </p><p>RESPONSE ADVISOR (HRA) IN HARARE. THE TEAM TRAVELED TO </p><p>ZIMBABWE TO DISCUSS THE INTERNALLY DISPLACED PERSON </p><p>(IDP) SITUATION, NOTING AN ONGOING ASSESSMENT BY THE </p><p>ZIMBABWE COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT TRUST (ZCDT) THAT </p><p>SUGGESTS THAT AS MANY AS 1.5 MILLION EX-COMMERCIAL FARM </p><p>WORKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES ARE CURRENTLY OR COULD SOON </p><p>BE IN VULNERABLE, AND POSSIBLY LIFE THREATENING </p><p>CIRCUMSTANCES FOLLOWING FARM EXPROPRIATIONS (NOTE: THE </p><p>TERM EX-FARM WORKERS HEREINAFTER REFERS TO BOTH ACTUAL </p><p>EX-FARM WORKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES.  END NOTE).  THESE </p><p>EX-FARM WORKERS ARE LOCATED PRIMARILY IN NORTHERN </p><p>ZIMBABWE IN THE PROVINCES OF MASHONALAND EAST, CENTRAL, </p><p>AND WEST, AND MANICALAND.  ON SEPTEMBER 19, THE ZCDT </p><p>RELEASED THE RESULTS OF A SURVEY IDENTIFYING 750,000 </p><p>VULNERABLE EX-FARM WORKERS, MANY OF WHOM HAVE BEGUN TO </p><p>MOVE ALONG ROADWAYS AND TO THE MARGINS OF CITIES.  ZCDT </p><p>REPORTS THAT MANY OF THOSE REMAINING ON THE FARMS ARE </p><p>DOING SO WITHOUT ACCESS TO SAFE WATER AND SANITATION. </p><p>NEWS SOURCES HAVE ALSO REPORTED DEATHS FROM DIARRHEA AND </p><p>CHOLERA AMONG EX-FARM WORKER POPULATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>3. SOME EX-FARM WORKERS ARE RECEIVING MEAGER `FORCED </p><p>RETRENCHMENT\' SEVERANCE PACKAGES FROM EXPELLED FARMERS, </p><p>AS REQUIRED BY ZIMBABWEAN LAW.  HOWEVER, MANY HAVE NOT </p><p>RECEIVED ANY SEVERANCE PAY.  ON SEPTEMBER 20, OFDA/HRA </p><p>INTERVIEWED TWO YOUNG EX-FARM WORKERS IN EPWORTH, AN </p><p>AREA IN SOUTHEAST METROPOLITAN HARARE.  EACH WAS GIVEN </p><p>2400 ZIMBABWEAN DOLLARS (Z2,400 = $US2.50) IN SEVERANCE </p><p>AND WAS SUBSISTING ON A DAILY BREAD LOAF THAT COST THEM </p><p>Z100.   (NOTE: AT THE CURRENT EXCHANGE RATE, ONE DOLLAR </p><p>U.S. EQUALS Z950.  END NOTE.)  WHILE SEVERANCE PACKAGES </p><p>VARY ACCORDING TO THE LENGTH OF SERVICE, THEY LIKELY </p><p>WON\'T LAST MUCH LONGER WITH THE RISING INFLATION IN </p><p>ZIMBABWE. </p><p> </p><p>4. MANY EX-FARM WORKERS\' VULNERABLE SITUATIONS ARE </p><p>EXACERBATED BY THE POLITICAL TENSIONS ASSOCIATED WITH </p><p>FARM EXPROPRIATIONS.  REPORTS INDICATE ABUSE OF EX-FARM </p><p>WORKERS AND DENIAL OF FOOD FOR POLITICAL REASONS.  A </p><p>REPUTABLE HUMAN RIGHTS ORGANIZATION STUDY INDICATES THAT </p><p>APPROXIMATELY THREE OUT OF FOUR EX-FARM WORKERS HAVE </p><p>BEEN PHYSICALLY ABUSED.  THE GENERAL AGRICULTURAL AND </p><p>PLANTATION WORKERS UNION OF ZIMBABWE (GAPWUZ) CITES THAT </p><p>AS MANY AS 60% OF EX-FARM WORKERS HAVE PARENTAGE </p><p>ORIGINATING IN NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES AND THUS ARE </p><p>TECHNICALLY CONSIDERED STATELESS, DESPITE HAVING VOTED </p><p>AND LIVED IN ZIMBABWE FOR DECADES, IF NOT GENERATIONS. </p><p>AS A RESULT, MANY OF THOSE WHO LEAVE COMMERCIAL FARMING </p><p>AREAS MAY BE ATTEMPTING TO BLEND INTO THE URBAN </p><p>POPULATION IN ORDER TO ESCAPE PERSECUTION. THIS </p><p>COMPLICATES THE IDENTIFICATION OF IDPS FOR PROVISION OF </p><p>HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. AT PRESENT, ONLY MINIMAL HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE IS </p><p>BEING PROVIDED TO THE EX-FARM WORKERS FOR SEVERAL </p><p>REASONS.  AS THE NORTHERN AREAS OF ZIMBABWE HAVE </p><p>TRADITIONALLY BEEN MORE SELF-SUFFICIENT, IN LARGE PART </p><p>BECAUSE OF THE COMMERCIAL FARMS, INTERNATIONAL NGOS HAVE </p><p>TENDED TO FOCUS ON THE LESS DEVELOPED AREAS OF THE </p><p>CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN PARTS OF THE COUNTRY.  HAVING </p><p>ALREADY ESTABLISHED AN INFRASTRUCTURE FOR DEVELOPMENT </p><p>ASSISTANCE IN THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN AREAS, THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL NGOS ARE FOCUSING THEIR HUMANITARIAN </p><p>ASSISTANCE ACTIVITIES IN THOSE AREAS AS WELL. ANOTHER </p><p>REASON IS THAT MOST NEWLY ARRIVED NGOS ARE IN THE </p><p>PROCESS OF REGISTERING AND ESTABLISHING THEMSELVES, </p><p>BRINGING IN STAFF, AND DEVELOPING LOGISTICAL </p><p>CAPABILITIES.  THE GOZ\'S BUREAUCRATIC AND LENGTHY </p><p>REGISTRATION PROCESS HAS SIGNIFICANTLY DELAYED A NUMBER </p><p>OF NGOS FROM COMMENCING HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE.  IT IS </p><p>NOT YET CLEAR HOW MANY OF THE NEWLY ESTABLISHED NGOS, IF </p><p>ANY, WILL TARGET THE NORTHERN AREAS AND/OR THE EX-FARM </p><p>WORKERS. FINALLY, BASED ON INTERVIEWS WITH INTERNATIONAL </p><p>AND LOCAL NGOS CONDUCTED BY OFDA/EDRO AND HRA ON OCTOBER </p><p>8, THESE ORGANIZATIONS ARE RELUCTANT TO WORK IN NORTHERN </p><p>AREAS BECAUSE OF THE POLITICAL TENSIONS ASSOCIATED WITH </p><p>ASSISTING EX-FARM WORKERS.   AT LEAST THREE MAJOR </p><p>INTERNATIONAL NGOS HAVE RECENTLY BEEN DENIED PERMISSION </p><p>TO UNDERTAKE FOOD DISTRIBUTIONS IN ZIMBABWE, SEVERELY </p><p>RESTRICTING THE AVAILABILITY OF QUALIFIED IMPLEMENTING </p><p>PARTNERS IN VULNERABLE AREAS. </p><p> </p><p>6. IN SOME COMMERCIAL FARMING AREAS, LOCAL NGOS </p><p>REPRESENT THE ONLY PROVIDER OF ASSISTANCE TO EX-FARM </p><p>WORKERS.  A LOCAL NGO CONSORTIUM, FOOD SECURITY NETWORK </p><p>(FOSENET), HAS BEEN FORMED TO MONITOR FOOD DELIVERY </p><p>PROBLEMS NATIONWIDE AND EX-FARM WORKERS ARE A SUBSET OF </p><p>THEIR CONCERN.  THEIR OBJECTIVES ARE TO FIELD LOCAL </p><p>CONCERNS AND ISSUES, AND PASS THEM ON TO THE UN </p><p>DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM (UNDP), THE UN WORLD FOOD PROGRAM, </p><p>DONORS AND THE INTERNATIONAL NGOS.  FOSENET IS </p><p>CONSIDERING EXPANDING ITS SCOPE OF WORK TO INCLUDE </p><p>RELIEF ELEMENTS AS WELL. </p><p> </p><p>7. IN ADDITION TO THE LACK OF QUALIFIED IMPLEMENTING </p><p>PARTNERS IN SOME SEVERELY AFFECTED AREAS, THERE IS NOT </p><p>YET AN EFFECTIVE IDP IDENTIFICATION FRAMEWORK IN PLACE. </p><p>USAID SUPPORTED THE CREATION OF THE UNDP/RELIEF AND </p><p>RECOVERY UNIT (UNDP/RRU) AS THE LEAD COORDINATING UNIT </p><p>FOR THE HUMANITARIAN RESPONSE, WITH RESPONSIBILITY FOR </p><p>MONITORING THE IDP SITUATION.  HOWEVER, THE RRU\'S IDP </p><p>SPECIALIST POSITION, ESSENTIAL FOR EFFECTIVE MONITORING </p><p>OF THE IDP SITUATION, HAS YET TO BE FILLED.  IN THE </p><p>ABSENCE OF AN IDP MONITORING UNIT, UNDP/RRU RECENTLY </p><p>SIGNED A MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING WITH THE MINISTRY </p><p>OF LABOR AND SOCIAL WELFARE TO CONDUCT A JOINT </p><p>ASSESSMENT OF THE NUMBER OF DISPLACED EX-FARM WORKERS. </p><p>WHILE THIS MAY BE A STEP FORWARD, AN INDEPENDENT, NON- </p><p>GOVERNMENTAL IDP MONITORING PROGRAM REMAINS VITAL TO THE </p><p>EFFECTIVE PROVISION OF HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE. </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>POTENTIAL DISPLACEMENT </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. OFDA/RA ESTIMATES THAT TWO-THIRDS OF THE EX-FARM </p><p>WORKERS WERE WORKING ON FARMS IN MASHONALAND, IN A 150 </p><p>KILOMETER RADIUS AROUND HARARE.  THIS IS THE PRIME </p><p>AGRICULTURAL LAND WHERE THE MAJORITY OF THE EXPROPRIATED </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARMS ARE LOCATED.  AS THE HUMANITARIAN </p><p>SITUATION IN THESE AREAS CONTINUES TO DETERIORATE, MOST </p><p>EX-FARM WORKERS ARE LEFT WITH THE CHOICE TO STAY WHERE </p><p>THEY ARE AND HOPE THAT HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE FINDS </p><p>THEM, OR TO MOVE IN SEARCH OF FOOD. </p><p> </p><p>9. AT PRESENT, IT APPEARS THAT MOST PEOPLE ARE CHOOSING </p><p>TO STAY WHERE THEY ARE.  HOWEVER, THERE IS DOCUMENTED </p><p>AND ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE THAT SMALL, BUT INCREASING </p><p>NUMBERS ARE ON THE MOVE.  SOME OF THE EX-FARM WORKERS, </p><p>PROBABLY IN THE LOW THOUSANDS, ARE LEAVING ZIMBABWE IF </p><p>THEY HAVE PASSPORTS AND MONEY.  NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES </p><p>ARE NOT OPENLY EMBRACING THEM.  OFDA/HRA IS HEARING </p><p>DISTURBING STORIES THAT THE GOZ MAY BE TRUCKING SOME </p><p>FARM WORKERS TO AREAS NEAR BORDERS, BUT THESE HAVE YET </p><p>TO BE CONFIRMED.  HOWEVER, IF LEFT TO THEIR OWN DEVICES, </p><p>AND IF THEY CAN FIND TRANSPORTATION, OFDA/HRA BELIEVES </p><p>THOSE ON THE MOVE WILL HEAD TOWARD HARARE AND OTHER </p><p>MEDIUM-SIZED TOWNS.  SIGNIFICANT EVIDENCE OF INFORMAL </p><p>SETTLEMENT GROWTH IN THE EPWORTH, HATCLIFFE EAST, </p><p>DZIVARASEKWA, PORTA CAMP, AND OTHER AREAS AROUND HARARE </p><p>HAS BEEN REPORTED BY NGOS AND WITNESSED BY OFDA/RA. </p><p> </p><p>10. THERE ARE SEVERAL REASONS TO BELIEVE THIS TREND WILL </p><p>CONTINUE IN THE COMING MONTHS.  FOOD MAY BE AVAILABLE IN </p><p>SHOPS, AND COSTS CAN BE LOWER IN THE CITIES BECAUSE </p><p>PRICE GOUGING IS MORE CONTROLLED.  IN ADDITION, THE </p><p>COMMUNAL FAMILY STRUCTURE IN RURAL AREAS IS ALREADY </p><p>STRETCHED TO CAPACITY AND CANNOT SUPPORT ADDITIONAL </p><p>FAMILY MEMBERS.  FINALLY, AND PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANTLY, </p><p>THE URBAN AREAS ARE NOT AS TIGHTLY CONTROLLED </p><p>POLITICALLY, ALLOWING EX-FARM WORKERS TO ESCAPE NOTICE. </p><p>AS MANY AS HALF OF THE EX-FARM WORKERS MAY DRIFT TOWARD </p><p>HARARE AND MOST OF THE REST TO NEIGHBORING SMALL CENTERS </p><p>SUCH AS CHINHOYI, BINDURA, CHITUNGWIZA, AND MARONDERA. </p><p>THIS PATTERN OF RURAL TO URBAN DISPLACEMENT WAS ALSO </p><p>RECORDED DURING THE 1992 FOOD SECURITY CRISIS, </p><p>SUGGESTING SIMILAR MOVEMENT AS THE FOOD SECURITY </p><p>SITUATION DETERIORATES. </p><p> </p><p>11. SOME HUMANITARIAN WORKERS IN ZIMBABWE BELIEVE THAT </p><p>IDPS MAY INCREASINGLY SEEK TO ESCAPE FOOD INSECURITY BY </p><p>LEAVING THE COUNTRY. THEY NOTE THAT EX-FARM WORKERS </p><p>OFTEN HAVE FAMILY ORIGINS IN NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES AND </p><p>SO MAY HAVE SOMEPLACE TO RETURN TO.  IN ADDITION, THE </p><p>RELATIVELY SMALL SIZE AND EXCELLENT TRANSPORT NETWORK IN </p><p>ZIMBABWE MAKE MOVING LONG DISTANCES BY PUBLIC TRANSPORT </p><p>POSSIBLE.  WHILE NOT ALL IDPS WILL HAVE MONEY FOR </p><p>TRANSPORT, A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER MAY CHOOSE TO TRY TO </p><p>ESCAPE THE CRISIS IN ZIMBABWE.  THE GOVERNMENT OF SOUTH </p><p>AFRICA HAS PLANS FOR THE POSSIBLE ARRIVAL OF EX-FARM </p><p>WORKERS AND OTHER VULNERABLE GROUPS.  THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>FEDERATION OF THE RED CROSS/RED CRESCENT SOCIETIES </p><p>(IFRC) IN PARTICULAR HAS BEEN VERY ACTIVE IN WORKING </p><p>WITH RED CROSS SOCIETIES IN COUNTRIES NEIGHBORING </p><p>ZIMBABWE TO PLAN FOR POSSIBLE ARRIVALS.  AS WITH </p><p>INTERNAL DISPLACEMENT IN ZIMBABWE, IT MAY BE VERY </p><p>DIFFICULT TO TRACK NUMBERS OF EX-FARM WORKERS LEAVING </p><p>ZIMBABWE, AS THEY WILL BE MOVING WITHOUT OFFICIAL </p><p>DOCUMENTATION AND WILL LIKELY TRY TO ESCAPE NOTICE. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>EX-FARM WORKERS REMAINING IN PLACE </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12. THOSE EX-FARM WORKERS WHO HAVE CHOSEN TO REMAIN IN </p><p>PLACE, OR HAVE NOT YET STARTED TO MOVE, HAVE DONE SO FOR </p><p>SEVERAL REASONS.  OVERALL HEALTH HAS NOT YET BECOME AN </p><p>ISSUE FOR THE GENERAL POPULATION AND MANY CAN WITHSTAND </p><p>ANOTHER FEW MONTHS OF WEIGHT LOSS.   ALSO, MANY ARE </p><p>STILL ABLE TO LIVE OFF THEIR SEVERANCE PACKAGE.  ANOTHER </p><p>BENEFIT OF REMAINING IN PLACE IS THE RESIDUAL MAIZE CROP </p><p>FROM THE COMMERCIAL FARMS.  SOME EX-FARM WORKERS HAVE </p><p>BEEN ABLE TO STASH SMALL AMOUNTS OF THIS MAIZE FOR </p><p>CONSUMPTION LATER.   THESE FACTORS, DEPENDING ON THE </p><p>CIRCUMSTANCES, COULD HOLD PEOPLE IN PLACE FOR ANOTHER </p><p>TWO TO THREE MONTHS. </p><p> </p><p>13. SOME EX-FARM WORKERS MAY LEAVE THEIR FARMS, BUT </p><p>INSTEAD OF MOVING DIRECTLY TOWARDS THE CITIES, THEY WILL </p><p>TAKE REFUGE AT OTHER FARMS WHERE THE PRESSURE TO MOVE IS </p><p>NOT SO INTENSE.  OFDA/HRA ALSO SUSPECTS THAT MANY WILL </p><p>BEGIN TO GO TO CHURCH-BASED MISSIONS WITH HOSPITALS THAT </p><p>ARE SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRYSIDE.  HOWEVER, THESE </p><p>MAY JUST BE WAY STATIONS ON THE MIGRATION ROUTE TO </p><p>CITIES AND TOWNS. </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>CONCLUSIONS </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>14. WHILE COPING MECHANISMS AND SEVERANCE PACKAGES MAY </p><p>SUSTAIN VULNERABLE EX-FARM WORKERS FOR ANOTHER FEW </p><p>MONTHS, THE LACK OF GOVERNMENT SUPPORT OR OTHER </p><p>HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE IN THE AFFECTED AREAS WILL </p><p>EVENTUALLY FORCE PEOPLE TO MOVE.  OFDA/HRA BELIEVES THAT </p><p>THE MIGRATION TO CITIES AND TOWNS WILL INTENSIFY VERY </p><p>SOON, WITH NOTICEABLE INCREASES BY JANUARY.  IN HARARE, </p><p>THAT MIGHT TRANSLATE INTO 100,000 TO 150,000 ADDITIONAL </p><p>EX-FARM WORKERS SQUATTING IN TEMPORARY SETTLEMENTS.  BY </p><p>MARCH, THESE NUMBERS COULD REACH 400,000 TO 500,000. </p><p>THE SAME DYNAMIC WILL LIKELY APPLY TO THE SMALLER </p><p>SURROUNDING REGIONAL TOWNS.  THE 1992 FOOD SECURITY </p><p>CRISIS PROVIDES A BLUEPRINT OF POPULATION MOVEMENTS IN A </p><p>SIMILAR SITUATION.  HOWEVER, THE ADDED COMPLEXITIES OF A </p><p>POLITICAL SITUATION LIMITING IDENTIFICATION AND </p><p>TARGETING OF IDPS COULD SERVE TO EXACERBATE THE EFFECTS </p><p>OF THE CURRENT CRISIS BEYOND THAT OF 1992. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>RECOMMENDATIONS </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>15. A STRENGTHENED UN HUMANITARIAN IDP MONITORING UNIT </p><p>IS ESSENTIAL TO THE EFFECTIVE UNDERSTANDING AND TRACKING </p><p>OF THE IDP SITUATION IN ZIMBABWE.  TO THE EXTENT </p><p>POSSIBLE, THE USG SHOULD WORK TO IMPROVE THIS CAPACITY. </p><p>IN PARTICULAR, INFORMATION GENERATION REGARDING THE </p><p>NUMBERS OF DISPLACED EX-FARM WORKERS AND THE LOCATIONS </p><p>OF IDP CAMPS AND INFORMAL SETTLEMENT AREAS IN AND AROUND </p><p>URBAN AREAS IS A HIGH PRIORITY FOR GUIDING HUMANITARIAN </p><p>RESPONSE. </p><p> </p><p>16. INTERNATIONAL AND LOCAL NGOS SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED TO </p><p>DEVELOP PROGRAMS TO RESPOND TO THE NEEDS OF DISPLACED EX- </p><p>FARM WORKERS IN COMMERCIAL FARMING AREAS OF ZIMBABWE. </p><p>PROGRAMS SHOULD MEET IMMEDIATE EMERGENCY NEEDS, SUCH AS </p><p>SUPPLEMENTAL AND THERAPEUTIC FEEDING, AS DESCRIBED IN </p><p>ONGOING SITUATION ASSESSMENTS.  SUCH PROGRAMS SHOULD BE </p><p>DEVELOPED URGENTLY TO DEAL WITH THESE IMMEDIATE NEEDS, </p><p>BUT ALSO TO PUT ASSISTANCE MECHANISMS IN PLACE BEFORE </p><p>LARGE-SCALE MOVEMENTS START TO OCCUR. </p><p> </p><p>17. THE GROWTH OF INFORMAL SETTLEMENTS IN AND AROUND </p><p>URBAN AREAS SHOULD BE CLOSELY MONITORED, AS LACK OF </p><p>ACCESS TO CLEAN WATER, FOOD, ADEQUATE SHELTER, AND BASIC </p><p>HEALTH CARE MAY LEAD TO EPIDEMIC DISEASE OUTBREAK AND </p><p>DRIVE CONTINUED POPULATION MOVEMENT.  WHERE APPROPRIATE, </p><p>EMERGENCY PROGRAMS RESPONDING TO NEEDS IN INFORMAL </p><p>SETTLEMENT AREAS SHOULD BE INITIATED.  SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
