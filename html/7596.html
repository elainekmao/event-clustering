<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 000728 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E FOR UNDER-SECRETARY LARSON </p><p>AF FOR ASSISTANT SECRETARY KANSTEINER </p><p>ALSO FOR E/EB/CBA - NSMITH-NISSLEY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FROM AMBASSADOR JETER </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: BEXP, EINV, ELAB, ETRD, SENV, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: NOMINATION FOR THE SECRETARY\'S AWARD </p><p>FOR CORPORATE EXCELLENCE </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) STATE 55713, (B) STATE 84067, (C) STATE 93791 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  There are several American companies in Nigeria </p><p>that might qualify for the Secretary\'s Award for </p><p>Corporate Excellence; however, one stands heads and </p><p>shoulders above the rest.  Chevron is the largest </p><p>single American investor in Nigeria and the second </p><p>largest producer of Nigerian oil.  It is also a </p><p>distinguished "Corporate Ambassador of Goodwill". </p><p>Chevron\'s activities have attracted our attention, and </p><p>the attention of many others, through its charitable </p><p>outreach, social responsibility, and determination to </p><p>tackle and overcome some of the most intractable </p><p>social and economic problems that confront Nigeria.  I </p><p>believe that Chevron Nigeria Limited is eminently </p><p>qualified for the Secretary\'s Award for Corporate </p><p>Excellence, and I hope that you will agree. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. Chevron Nigeria is a unit of Chevron Corporation. </p><p>One of the world\'s largest integrated petroleum </p><p>enterprises, the company has operated in Nigeria since </p><p>1961. Chevron\'s strong commitment to corporate social </p><p>responsibility is reflected in its programs promoting </p><p>education, health, sustainable economic development </p><p>and humanitarian assistance.  Most beneficiaries are </p><p>communities in the remote Niger Delta, an area rich in </p><p>oil and natural gas, and one which presents enormous </p><p>operational challenges and even larger problems of </p><p>public safety and security.  During the past decade, </p><p>Chevron spent more than $30 million on water </p><p>facilities, electric power, landing jetties, roads, </p><p>school buildings, scholarships, books, laboratories, </p><p>teachers, health care, water transport, and civic </p><p>centers for the people of the troubled Niger Delta </p><p>region.  In the past few years, Chevron decided to </p><p>more than double that amount, targeting $65 million </p><p>for community program activities and significantly </p><p>increasing the number of recipients. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. Education is a key concern in Nigeria; </p><p>specifically, facilitating educational access while </p><p>halting the decline in educational quality in rural </p><p>schools. In the remote marshy regions of the Niger </p><p>Delta, school infrastructure is inadequate, poverty </p><p>widespread, and qualified and motivated teachers </p><p>scarce. Equally rare are teaching aids, textbooks, and </p><p>laboratory equipment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  To help resolve these problems, Chevron has </p><p>furnished and equipped 54 schools over the last ten </p><p>years. Working with Nigeria\'s National Youth Service </p><p>Corps (NYSC), Chevron has provided housing and medical </p><p>care to English, mathematics, and science teachers in </p><p>order to attract and retain them in the Delta\'s rural </p><p>areas. The results have been remarkable: increased </p><p>student attendance at schools, improved academic </p><p>performance, higher female student enrollment, and the </p><p>introduction of extra-curricular activities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  To encourage science education in secondary </p><p>schools and to support higher studies in engineering </p><p>and technology, Chevron sponsors science fairs and </p><p>competitions, and donates books, journals and </p><p>professional manuals. To its singular credit, Chevron </p><p>equipped a BioTechnology Center at the Federal </p><p>University of Technology in Yola, the only such center </p><p>in Nigeria.  Moreover, Yola - located in Nigeria\'s </p><p>distant and remote Northeast - is far from Chevron </p><p>area of interest, the oil-producing Niger Delta. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  Chevron also sponsors two scholarship programs: </p><p>Community Scholarships, for youngsters near its </p><p>operations; and National University Scholarships, open </p><p>to all Nigerian students pursuing full-time degrees in </p><p>Nigerian universities. Since 1993, Chevron has awarded </p><p>12,224 Community and 2,450 National University </p><p>scholarships. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  As remarkable as these achievements may seem, </p><p>Chevron shows no sign of diminishing its engagement. </p><p>Partnering with the International Foundation for </p><p>Education and Self-Help (IFESH), a U.S.-based, non- </p><p>profit organization founded by the late Reverend Leon </p><p>Sullivan, Chevron commissioned the five-year Western </p><p>Niger Delta Development Program (WNDDP) two years ago. </p><p>WNDDP supports acquisition of technical skills, </p><p>educational infrastructure, micro-enterprise, HIV/AIDS </p><p>awareness, and conflict resolution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  Since WNDDP\'s inception, 260 young men and women </p><p>have been trained in welding and fabrication, business </p><p>development, marine services, computer literacy, and </p><p>secretarial studies; two primary school buildings and </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>teachers\' quarters are being built; some 250 small </p><p>businesses have received micro-loans. An impressive </p><p>100 percent loan recovery rate was recorded in the </p><p>program\'s first full cycle. WNDDP\'s loan portfolio has </p><p>grown from eight million to fourteen million naira </p><p>(from about $62,000 to $108,000) in just two years. </p><p>Plans call for increasing the number of participating </p><p>communities from four to thirty, with a commensurate </p><p>growth in funding. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  Chevron is also supporting another technical </p><p>skills acquisition program through which 50 young men </p><p>and women are trained annually in welding and metal </p><p>fabrication, computer literacy, and secretarial </p><p>studies. Graduates find jobs in the oil industry, set </p><p>up their own businesses, or otherwise greatly enhance </p><p>their prospects for public and private sector </p><p>employment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  Chevron Nigeria is unmatched as a responsible </p><p>U.S. corporate citizen in Nigeria.  With its current </p><p>budget of over $65 million and 50 engineering and </p><p>community development staff, Chevron Nigeria works </p><p>with non-governmental organizations and local </p><p>governments to support sustainable community economic </p><p>growth and development. The goal: profitable </p><p>enterprises that can be turned over to community-based </p><p>owners. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  Chevron Nigeria is positively involved in </p><p>providing primary and secondary health care to the </p><p>people of the Delta.  Scheduled visits by the </p><p>RiverBoat Clinic (RBC)--which has a full complement of </p><p>doctors, nurses and health assistants--ensure regular </p><p>health care to slightly more than three thousand </p><p>people in the Niger Delta. Most of them live more than </p><p>100 kilometers from the nearest government-provided </p><p>health facility. Central to Chevron\'s community </p><p>healthcare initiative, RBC provides health care to </p><p>remote, often inaccessible communities in the Delta, </p><p>where typically there are no alternative services. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  Chevron is acutely aware that HIV/AIDS is a </p><p>medical, social and business issue that affects every </p><p>aspect of life, and future prospects for Nigeria\'s </p><p>social, economic, and political development.  Its </p><p>Chevron Workplace AIDS Prevention Program (CWAPP) </p><p>focuses on peer education, community-based prevention, </p><p>condom distribution, and training for supervisors, </p><p>managers and union leaders. Since the late 1990s, </p><p>Chevron has participated in World AIDS Day and the </p><p>International AIDS Candlelight Memorial. Recognizing </p><p>Chevron\'s exceptional service, President Obasanjo </p><p>recently designated Chevron\'s Managing Director Co- </p><p>Chair of Nigeria\'s public-private sector alliance in </p><p>the fight against HIV/AIDS in Nigeria.  Chevron is </p><p>also a member of Nigeria\'s National Action Committee </p><p>on AIDS (NACA), where it is exploring possibilities to </p><p>apply core corporate competencies in communications, </p><p>marketing, and organization to NACA\'s programs to </p><p>combat HIV/AIDS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. The target of Chevron\'s Adolescent Reproductive </p><p>Health Program (CHARP) is its employees\' children </p><p>between the ages of 12-19.  Truly innovative, Chevron </p><p>relies on its "edutainment" to reach these youngsters </p><p>in ways they understand. Some 200 children and parents </p><p>have participated in annual Chevron-sponsored HIV/AIDS </p><p>workshops. Many of these people have become members of </p><p>Chevron\'s Lifeline Adolescent Reproductive Education </p><p>Klub (CLARK). Putting on dramatic plays and poetry </p><p>readings, they serve as community role models and </p><p>resources for peers and parents alike. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14.  In addition to these health-related activities, </p><p>Chevron Nigeria also partners with the Carter Center </p><p>to combat river blindness and to sponsor primary </p><p>health care programs for primary school children in </p><p>its area of operation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15.  Equally important has been Chevron\'s humanitarian </p><p>assistance.  Frequent inter-ethnic and political </p><p>rivalries have often led to violent conflicts near its </p><p>operations. In the last four years, Chevron Nigeria </p><p>has helped airlift more than 4,000 local villagers to </p><p>safety.  Two weeks ago, Chevron airlifted more than </p><p>2,000 villagers to safety after their villages had </p><p>been attacked and destroyed by a rival ethnic group. </p><p>After airlifting them to safety, the company also </p><p>provided food assistance and temporary shelter, in </p><p>collaboration with the Nigerian Government and local </p><p>NGOs.  Its medical personnel have worked with local </p><p>leaders to provide relief services for internally </p><p>displaced persons seeking refuge at Chevron </p><p>facilities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16.  Much more could be written about Chevron\'s </p><p>qualifications for the 2003 Secretary of State\'s Award </p><p>for Corporate Excellence.  Suffice it to say that </p><p>through its activities in Nigeria, Chevron has </p><p>exemplified the highest standards of conduct with </p><p>respect to good corporate citizenship, exemplary </p><p>business practices, and innovation in its overseas </p><p>operations.  Its community-focused activities have won </p><p>Chevron a special place of corporate distinction in </p><p>Nigeria.  Equally as important, its activities have </p><p>also projected a positive image of the United States </p><p>and helped to advance American foreign policy </p><p>objectives.  Chevron\'s programs help to improve and </p><p>save lives. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>17.  I can think of no more fitting way for the </p><p>Department to recognize Chevron\'s contributions than </p><p>by selecting it this year for the Secretary\'s Award </p><p>for Corporate Excellence. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
