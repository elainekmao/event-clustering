<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 003280 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/28/2011 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PHUM, KDEM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: NATIONAL ASSEMBLY TO REVIEW ELECTORAL ACT </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA 3228 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by CDA Andrews; Reasons 1.5 (b/d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) The Nigerian House of Representatives may cut short </p><p>its holiday recess (through January 22) to the first week of </p><p>January to review the electoral act signed by President </p><p>Obasanjo on December 6.  Speaker of the House Ghali Umar </p><p>Na\'Abba said that a committee created at his discretion had </p><p>already met and drafted an amended version of the law.  The </p><p>Senate may also review the law during a session primarily </p><p>addressing security in the wake of the Ige assassination.  A </p><p>principal point in the controversy is the allegation that the </p><p>legislation Obasanjo signed is not identical to the bill </p><p>passed by the National Assembly. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Since Obasanjo signed the controversial act, it has </p><p>been at the center stage of Nigerian politics (reftel), </p><p>overtaken in the media only by the assassination of Attorney </p><p>General Chief Bola Ige.  The governors, in addition to human </p><p>and civil rights advocates and members of new political </p><p>associations, complain that the act was designed to protect </p><p>Federal-level incumbents against challengers and the existing </p><p>parties (or at least the PDP and APP, since the AD is falling </p><p>apart) against new political groupings. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) One of the most controversial sections of the law </p><p>(Clause 80.1) dictates that only parties gaining 10 percent </p><p>of the seats in local government elections spread among at </p><p>least two-thirds of Nigeria\'s states are allowed to contest </p><p>in national elections.  Because the act also dictates that </p><p>local government elections will occur after state and </p><p>national contests, the act precludes new political parties </p><p>from contesting for state and national seats in 2003. </p><p>(Moreover, since the governors will be replaced before local </p><p>government officials, it removes a great deal of </p><p>gubernatorial influence in 2003.).  It will be extremely </p><p>difficult for new political groups to build strength among </p><p>the electorate and to raise funds if they have no hope of </p><p>influence beyond the LGA level in 2003. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) It now appears that this controversial clause may not </p><p>have been in the final version of the bill passed by the </p><p>National Assembly to the President.  Speaker Na\'Abba, </p><p>describing the chain of events in "ThisDay" on December 27, </p><p>stated that the President sought amendments from the Assembly </p><p>after he received the bill, but that this request had been </p><p>rejected.  According to Na\'Abba, the controversial clause </p><p>80.1 was not in the bill that the Assembly sent to the </p><p>President for his signature.  His implication is that </p><p>President Obasanjo or his advisers engaged in some sort of </p><p>line-item amendment.  Several Senators have suggested the </p><p>same thing. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Beyond the doubtful constitutionality of a line-item </p><p>amendment, the allegation of impropriety on the part of Aso </p><p>Rock does nothing to build confidence in the political </p><p>system.  Already, prominent voices are questioning whether </p><p>the President broke the law.  Secretary of the Board of </p><p>Trustees of the United Nigeria Development Party Bashir A. </p><p>Albasu, described the action of the President as an </p><p>impeachable offense, and said the system was moving in such a </p><p>way as to allow Obasanjo to become a "civilian dictator." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) Of course, voices from new political organizations </p><p>are the most vehement.  However, dissenting voices are being </p><p>raised even within Obasanjo\'s own party.  Representative </p><p>Farouq Lawan (PDP-Kano), Chairman of the House </p><p>Inter-Parliamentary Relations Committee noted that the clause </p><p>on new party exclusion was never discussed on the House </p><p>floor, and said, "This is not dictatorship.  This is </p><p>democracy and you cannot impose an unpopular law on the </p><p>people."  Senator Samaila Mamman (PDP-Kano), called </p><p>Obasanjo\'s action "immoral," and publicly threatened to </p><p>resign his seat if the upper house refuses to review the law </p><p>when it resumes business in January. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) More disturbing are growing references to Nigeria\'s </p><p>troubled past.  National Chairman of the People\'s Redemption </p><p>Party (PRP), Alhaji Abdulkadir Balarabe Musa, was quoted as </p><p>saying that, "This was what happened in the 1983 elections, </p><p>when the then-ruling National Party of Nigeria used its </p><p>incumbency to win the whole elections, this action prompted </p><p>the military to take over power from the NPN after only three </p><p>months of stolen tenure." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) The electoral law was the subject of much public </p><p>debate on its merits, even before questions about the </p><p>propriety of its enactment were raised.  If a political </p><p>solution cannot be found quickly, the courts may find </p><p>themselves faced not only with a question of whether the law </p><p>(as signed by Obasanjo) is compatible with the 1999 </p><p>Constitution but also asked to determine whether the law </p><p>before them was duly enacted. </p><p>Andrews </p><p></p></div>
