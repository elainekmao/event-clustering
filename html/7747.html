(C) The suspension of Harare mayor Elias Mudzuri, on April </p><p>29 for alleged mismanagement of the city is an effort by the </p><p>ruling party ZANU-PF to regain control of the capital city. </p><p>The Minister of Local Government, Public Works, and National </p><p>Housing, Ignatius Chombo, by applying Section 54 of the Urban </p><p>Councils Act, seems to be trying to pave the way for </p><p>Mudzuri,s dismissal despite having no legal basis to do so. </p><p>We are not certain how Mudzuri will react to this attempt--he </p><p>has been counseled to challenge the suspension in High </p><p>Court--but in the interim we think that the USG\'s position </p><p>should be that Mudzuri remains the legally elected and </p><p>empowered mayor.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Minister Suspends Mayor for Mismanagement </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>2. (U) Following the April 29 Cabinet meeting, Minister of </p><p>Local Government, Public Works, and National Housing, </p><p>Ignatius Chombo announced Executive Mayor of Harare Elias </p><p>Mudzuri,s suspension from office pending the results of an </p><p>investigation for misconduct.  The Deputy Mayor, Sekesayi </p><p>Makwavarara, also MDC is a woman whom Mudzuri has privately </p><p>characterized as &not sharp8 in a conversation with the </p><p>Ambassador, will be acting mayor.  The suspension came on the </p><p>opening day of the Harare International Festival of the Arts </p><p>and during the visit by the Deputy Mayor of Harare\'s sister </p><p>city Munich, who was outraged with the suspension.  Since </p><p>Mudzuri took office in March 2002, ZANU-PF, Chombo has been </p><p>ZANU-PF\'s hatchet man in a campaign to discredit the mayor </p><p>and undermine his influence.  The GOZ even went so far as to </p><p>arrest the mayor, deputy mayor, and several councilors in </p><p>January for meeting with constituents, in supposed </p><p>contravention of the Public Order and Security Act.  (See </p><p>Reftel). </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Chombo told the government-controlled newspaper, </p><p>Herald that a committee of inquiry would be appointed next </p><p>week to investigate the allegations and recommend a course of </p><p>action.  Chombo said the committee, unlike a commission, </p><p>would not run the affairs of the city--leaving the </p><p>overwhelmingly MDC-dominated council intact to continue </p><p>governing Harare.  Mudzuri told the Ambassador that he urged </p><p>his councilors not to quit in protest at his suspension. </p><p>(NOTE: Under the Urban Councils Act, the Minister may appoint </p><p>a commission to act as council if all the councilors have </p><p>been suspended or are unable to exercise all or some of their </p><p>functions.  END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Chombo claimed that Mudzuri was suspended because of </p><p>mismanagement of city affairs that has led to a decline in </p><p>service delivery.  In particular, Chombo accuses Mudzuri of: </p><p>--Failing to deliver and publicize a strategic turnaround </p><p>plan for the city. </p><p>--Arbitrarily suspending key management staff without a staff </p><p>audit. </p><p>--Abusing his authority by selectively reprimanding employees </p><p>for misconduct. </p><p>--Encouraging illegal activities within the city through </p><p>press advertisements, contrary to one of the council mandates </p><p>to protect the public health of residents. </p><p>--Flouting and ignoring tender procedures to benefit </p><p>individuals and companies of his choosing.  He is also </p><p>accused of manipulating these procedures in tendering </p><p>services related to water billing systems, street light </p><p>fittings, procurement of water treatment chemicals, and </p><p>refuse collection. </p><p>--Mismanaging public finances by producing partisan documents </p><p>not in the interest of sound, smooth governance. </p><p>--Encouraging employees to participate in the stayaways in </p><p>March and April. </p><p>--Failing to sufficiently supply water to the city and </p><p>satellite towns since September. </p><p> </p><p>Measured Response By Party </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>5. (U) Mudzuri dismissed Chombo,s accusations telling the </p><p>independent newspaper, Daily News, denying that there are </p><p>suitable grounds for suspension.  However he would be willing </p><p>to submit his performance and continued tenure in office to </p><p>city residents in a referendum.  (NOTE: The Urban Councils </p><p>Act states that the Minister may suspend a mayor if he is </p><p>suspected of having been guilty of conduct that renders him </p><p>unsuitable as a mayor.  The same clause states that the </p><p>President may dismiss a mayor if he is guilty of conduct that </p><p>makes him unsuitable to be mayor.  END NOTE.)  Mudzuri </p><p>claimed that Chombo wants to trigger unnecessary chaos and </p><p>confusion in the city.  At a subsequent dinner with the </p><p>Ambassador, MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai told the Ambassador </p><p>the MDC would not rush into street protests over this issue. </p><p>He said the MDC would stick to its own timetable.  Another </p><p>dinner guest, former Finance Minister Simba Makoni speculated </p><p>that this latest development could be part of a move by the </p><p>&Gang of Four8 (Chombo, Agriculture Minister Joseph Made, </p><p>Information Minister Jonathan Moyo, and Minister of Justice </p><p>Patrick Chinamasa) to consolidate their positions and </p><p>"radicalize" the situation amid reports that their sole </p><p>source of influence and power--President Robert Mugabe--may </p><p>be contemplating retirement. </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) Beatrice Mtetwa, Mudzuri\'s attorney, outlined the </p><p>mayor\'s response to Chombo.  Mtetwa said she would deliver a </p><p>letter to Chombo today stating that he has no legal basis for </p><p>suspending Mudzuri but that they would not take him to court </p><p>over the matter.  Mtetwa told us she is advising Mudzuri to </p><p>not go to court because the likelihood that he would face a </p><p>judge sympathetic to ZANU-PF was great.  The objective is to </p><p>force Chombo to prove his case rather than have Mudzuri prove </p><p>his innocence.  Elder ZANU-PF statesman, Eddison Zvobgo, who </p><p>told the Ambassador that he had talked with Mudzuri about the </p><p>suspension and informed Mudzuri that Chombo has no </p><p>"reasonable grounds" as stated in the act for suspending </p><p>Mudzuri.  He counseled Mudzuri to file a petition with the </p><p>High Court charging Chombo with overreaching his authority. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>7. (C) The suspension of Mayor Mudzuri--a popular mayor who </p><p>has had some successes in improving city services despite the </p><p>ZANU-PF campaign to sabotage his efforts--is a transparent </p><p>attempt to prevent the MDC\'s most prominent office-holder </p><p>from delivering services effectively and thus further </p><p>diminishing the ruling party\'s waning support in the capital </p><p>city. Since other ZANU-PF tactics have not succeeded in </p><p>dashing Mudzuri\'s popularity, ZANU-PF has ignored legal </p><p>niceties in its attempts to unseat the mayor.  Chombo </p><p>probably intends to use a section of the Urban Councils Act </p><p>to assemble a hand-picked committee assembled to </p><p>"investigate" the allegations and determine that the </p><p>President has grounds to dismiss the mayor. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Mudzuri told the Ambassador that in spite of the </p><p>suspension he would still like to attend the International </p><p>Conference of Mayors in Denver in June and fulfill his prior </p><p>Washington appointments.  We strongly support this course of </p><p>action.  Given the clearly political nature of his suspension </p><p>and the fact that this is only a suspension and not a </p><p>dismissal, our maintaining USG sponsorship of this trip would </p><p>send a strong signal of support for the MDC mayor at this </p><p>difficult time. Chombo\'s machinations aside, it remains our </p><p>view that Mudzuri is still the legally elected leader of this </p><p>city.  End Comment. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
