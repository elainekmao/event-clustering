<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ROME 000160 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>EUR/WE FOR DEAN FROM CHARGE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/14/2013 </p><p>TAGS: AMGT, IT, UN </p><p>SUBJECT: OFFICIAL-INFORMAL NO. 01, 01/14/02 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: CHARGE D\'AFFAIRES EMIL SKODON FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D </p><p>). </p><p> </p><p>---- </p><p>DPRK </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) DURING MY COURTESY CALLS YESTERDAY ON THE MFA DG AND </p><p>U/S FOR ASIA (GUIDO MARTINI AND MARGHERITA BONIVER, </p><p>RESPECTIVELY), THE GOI PROPOSAL TO SHIP "HUMANITARIAN" FUEL </p><p>OIL TO NORTH KOREA AROSE.  OUR IMPRESSION WAS THAT THIS WAS </p><p>AN INITIATIVE OF THE DG WHILE THE U/S WAS ON HOLIDAY LEAVE. </p><p>BONIVER QUASHED IT AS SOON AS SHE RETURNED, EMPHASIZING THE </p><p>NEED TO WORK THROUGH/WITH US.  THEY ARE STILL INTERESTED, </p><p>HOWEVER -- IF WE THINK IT OR ANOTHER INITIATIVE MIGHT BE </p><p>USEFUL.  (BERLUSCONI APPARENTLY AGAIN URGED HIS TEAM TO BE </p><p>PROACTIVE IN HELPING THE U.S. IF POSSIBLE.)  ABSENT SPECIFIC </p><p>GUIDANCE FROM WASHINGTON ABOUT THE GOI PROPOSAL, I SUGGESTED </p><p>THIS WAS NOT THE MOST OPPORTUNE TIME FOR SUCH AN INITIATIVE, </p><p>AS WE STRONGLY DID NOT WANT ANYTHING DONE THAT COULD BE </p><p>INTERPRETED AS A REWARD FOR DPRK BAD BEHAVIOR.  I STRONGLY </p><p>RECOMMENDED THEY HOLD THE IDEA IN ABEYANCE, AT LEAST FOR THE </p><p>TIME BEING. </p><p> </p><p>--- </p><p>MPP </p><p>--- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) WOULD LIKE TO KEEP YOU APPRISED OF MPP PROCESS AS </p><p>WE MOVE FORWARD, TO MAKE SURE WE ARE IN SYNC TO EXTENT </p><p>POSSIBLE.   WE DISCUSSED THE BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP, EMBASSY </p><p>ACTIVITIES, AND POLICY PRIORITIES FOR FORTHCOMING FY\'S AT A </p><p>FREEWHEELING ALL-AGENCIES MEETING ON 13 JANUARY.  FOLLOWING </p><p>WERE IDENTIFIED AS KEY STRATEGIC AND PERFORMANCE GOALS (IN NO </p><p>PARTICULAR ORDER): </p><p> </p><p>REGIONAL STABILITY, RS.01 -- CLOSE TIES WITH ALLIES AND </p><p>FRIENDS </p><p> </p><p>ECONOMIC PROSPERITY AND SECURITY, EP.03 -- EXPANSION OF U.S. </p><p>ECONOMIC ACCESS </p><p> </p><p>AMERICAN CITIZENS, AC.01 -- ASSISTANCE TO CITIZENS ABROAD </p><p> </p><p>INTERNATIONAL CRIME AND DRUGS, IC.02 -- LAW ENFORCEMENT AND </p><p>JUDICIAL SYSTEM COOPERATION </p><p> </p><p>HOMELAND SECURITY, HS.01 -- PROPER VISA ADJUDICATION AND </p><p>HS.02 -- INFRASTRUCTURE NETWORK PROTECTION </p><p> </p><p>COUNTERTERRORISM, CT.01 -- ACTIVE ANTI-TERRORIST COALITIONS, </p><p>CT.02 -- FROZEN TERRORIST ASSETS, AND CT.03 -- PREVENTION AND </p><p>RESPONSE TO TERRORISM </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  WE HAVE SET UP WORKING GROUPS TO ADDRESS EACH OF THE </p><p>SIX STRATEGIC GOAL AREAS, CONSOLIDATE SOME OF THE MULTIPLE </p><p>PERFORMANCE GOALS UNDER THE HOMELAND SECURITY AND </p><p>COUNTERTERRORISM RUBRICS, AND DRAFT PERFORMANCE GOAL PAPERS. </p><p>POL, ECON, JUSTICE, AND CONS WILL BE PRIMARY DRAFTERS.  SORRY </p><p>FOR GOING THROUGH SUCH A LENGTHY DESCRIPTION, BUT THIS WILL </p><p>BE CONSUMING A FAIR AMOUNT OF TIME AND I THOUGHT IT USEFUL </p><p>FOR YOU TO KNOW WHAT WAS HAPPENING.  LET ME KNOW IF ANY OF </p><p>THE POLICY DIRECTIONS IN WHICH WE ARE HEADING STRIKE A </p><p>DISCORDANT NOTE WITH YOU. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>MARZANO </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) SCOTT WILL BE MEETING WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 15, AT </p><p>1830 WITH PRODUCTIVE ACTIVITIES MINISTER MARZANO TO TRY TO </p><p>LIGHT A FIRE UNDER MINISTRY PREPARATIONS FOR THE FEBRUARY </p><p>VISIT TO WASHINGTON OF A PTO DELEGATION.
