<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L OTTAWA 001539 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/29/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MARR, CA, Missile Defense </p><p>SUBJECT: MISSILE DEFENSE: CANADA ANNOUNCES DECISION TO </p><p>ENTER NEGOTIATIONS </p><p> </p><p>REF: OTTAWA 1437 AND PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Minister Counselor Brian Flora, </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>THIS IS AN ACTION REQUEST - SEE PARA 6. </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY AND COMMENT: The Canadian Government announced </p><p>on May 29 that it has decided to enter into discussions with </p><p>the U.S. on missile defense participation.  This decision </p><p>represents a dramatic shift in Canadian policy on missile </p><p>defense, which was generally viewed in a negative light here </p><p>prior to 2002 because of arms control concerns.  Over the </p><p>past several months, Defense Minister McCallum and Foreign </p><p>Minister Graham were able to convince Prime Minister Chretien </p><p>and most of the Liberal Party caucus that participation in </p><p>missile defense would be in Canada\'s national interest. </p><p>Their strongest argument was that since the U.S. was </p><p>proceeding with missile defense deployment, Canada would be </p><p>jeopardizing its defense relationship with us, in particular </p><p>NORAD, if it did not join.  Now that Canada has taken the </p><p>plunge, we need to work with them to reach an agreement that </p><p>keeps our defense partnership on track. END SUMMARY AND </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Canadian Defense Minister McCallum announced on May 29 </p><p>that the GoC has decided to enter into discussions with the </p><p>U.S. on Canadian participation in missile defense.  McCallum </p><p>said this decision was motivated by a desire to protect </p><p>Canadian lives and to preserve NORAD\'s role in the defense of </p><p>North America.  He specifically noted that Canada would like </p><p>the North American missile defense mission to be assigned to </p><p>NORAD, vice NORTHCOM.  McCallum also reiterated Canada\'s </p><p>opposition to weaponization of space, and said that any </p><p>agreement on Canadian participation in missile defense would </p><p>still have to be blessed by Cabinet. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Foreign Affairs (DFAIT) and National Defense (DND) </p><p>contacts told us that the decision to enter missile defense </p><p>negotiations was taken at the May 26 Cabinet meeting, but </p><p>that Prime Minister Chretien had planned to announce the </p><p>decision during his ongoing visit to Europe.  The government </p><p>changed plans because the opposition Canadian Alliance Party </p><p>introduced a motion in the House of Commons on May 29 </p><p>affirming its support for NORAD as a counter to ballistic </p><p>missile threats.  The GoC decided to go ahead and announce </p><p>its decision in response to the Canadian Alliance motion. </p><p>The announcement was roundly criticized by Bloc Quebecois and </p><p>New Democratic Party MPs.  (COMMENT: We anticipate sniping </p><p>from hardcore Liberal Party opponents as well, including </p><p>Heritage Minister and Liberal leadership candidate Sheila </p><p>Copps.  END COMMENT) </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Ron Hoffmann, DFAIT Director for Defense and Security </p><p>Policy, stressed to us that NORAD\'s role in missile defense </p><p>was the key issue in the Cabinet debate over entering </p><p>negotiations.  Several Cabinet officials argued that the </p><p>future of Canada\'s role in North American defense would be </p><p>determined by NORAD\'s involvement in the missile defense </p><p>system.  Other issues included territorial coverage, </p><p>industrial cooperation, and weaponization of space.  Hoffmann </p><p>told us that the GoC recognizes the U.S. is not going to </p><p>agree to any limits on future direction of the missile </p><p>defense system, and that the GoC would like to "park" the </p><p>space weaponization issue and not have it become a sticking </p><p>point in negotiations.  He likened this issue to Canada\'s </p><p>position on nuclear disarmament, which it supports while also </p><p>subscribing to a NATO nuclear strategy. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Hoffmann told us that the GoC would like to begin </p><p>negotiations as soon as possible.  As a preliminary step, </p><p>Assistant Deputy Ministers Jim Wright (DFAIT) and Ken Calder </p><p>(DND) would like to visit Washington and lay out Canada\'s </p><p>decision and negotiating mandate for senior officials at </p><p>State and Defense.  Hoffmann proposed this visit taking place </p><p>on June 5 or 6.  The GoC would then propose to send its full </p><p>negotiating team to Washington on June 13 or 17 to begin </p><p>discussions.  We cautioned that the U.S. side might need more </p><p>time before starting talks.  Hoffmann urged us to at least </p><p>agree to an early visit by Wright and Calder so that they </p><p>could lay out the GoC approach. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) ACTION REQUEST: Please advise on availability of U.S. </p><p>officials for meetings with Wright and Calder. </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
