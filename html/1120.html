(C) SUMMARY: IN A SERIES OF CALLS BEING MADE ON </p><p>SENIOR GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, ON JUNE 8 AMBASSADOR AND </p><p>ECONOFF MET WITH SIMON K. MOYO, MINISTER OF MINES, </p><p>ENVIRONMENT AND TOURISM, TO DISCUSS CONDITIONS IN </p><p>ZIMBABWE RELATED TO THE ELECTIONS, AND OUR ABHORRENCE </p><p>OF THE STATE-SPONSORED VIOLENCE AND INTIMIDATION THAT </p><p>HAS OCCURRED TO DATE.  MOYO, CONSIDERED BY MANY TO BE </p><p>A ZANU-PF PROGRESSIVE, WAS GLIB, DISPLAYED AN </p><p>ADMIRABLE BOB-AND-WEAVE TECHNIQUE, AND PARROTED THE </p><p>PARTY LINE.  HIS EXPRESSED A PERSONAL DISDAIN OF </p><p>VIOLENCE, LABELING IT GOOD FOR NO ONE, BUT CLAIMED </p><p>THAT BOTH PARTIES WERE EQUALLY TO BLAME FOR ITS </p><p>OCCURRENCE.  HE ALSO CRITICIZED THE NATIONAL </p><p>DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTE (NDI) REPORT ON UNSATISFACTORY </p><p>ELECTION CONDITIONS, POSTULATING THAT A NINE-DAY TRIP </p><p>WITH VISITS TO ONLY THREE LOCATIONS WAS INSUFFICIENT </p><p>TO ACCURATELY ASSESS TRUE CONDITIONS ON THE GROUND. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR KICKED OFF THE MEETING BY </p><p>ASKING IF A FRONT-PAGE HEADLINE IN THE INDEPENDENT </p><p>NEWSPAPER "THE DAILY NEWS", PROCLAIMING THAT "TOP </p><p>ZANU-PF LEADERS CALL FOR END TO VIOLENCE" WAS </p><p>CORRECT.  DODGING THE DIRECT QUESTION, MINISTER MOYO </p><p>LAMENTED THE EXISTENCE OF VIOLENCE AND ATTRIBUTED IT </p><p>TO THE EXISTENCE, FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE </p><p>INDEPENDENCE, OF AN ACTUAL, VIABLE, AND ORGANIZED </p><p>OPPOSITION, FIELDING 120 CANDIDATES.  "IT HAS RAISED </p><p>THE TEMPERATURE", HE STATED, "ESPECIALLY SINCE BOTH </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03094  01 OF 02  081537Z </p><p>SIDES VIEW THEMSELVES AS THE WINNERS."  BOTH PARTIES </p><p>HAVE CAUSED THE VIOLENCE HE CONTINUED, AND THE </p><p>LEADERS OF BOTH NEED TO CONTROL THEIR FOLLOWERS.  WE </p><p>ARE DOING THAT NOW, HE ADMITTED, TELLING US THAT THE </p><p>JUNE 7 POLITBURO MEETING PARTICIPANTS DECIDED THAT </p><p>THE RULING PARTY WOULD PUBLICLY BEGIN CALLING FOR AN </p><p>END TO THE VIOLENCE.  THE POLICE NEED TO DO THEIR </p><p>JOB, HE ADDED, AND THAT SHOULD START NOW HE TOLD US, </p><p>INFERRING THAT THEY HAD BEEN GIVEN THE GREEN LIGHT BY </p><p>THE OFFICIAL DECISION-MAKING ORGAN. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR ACKNOWLEDGED THE MINISTER\'S </p><p>HIGH-MINDED SENTIMENTS, BUT POINTED OUT THAT THE </p><p>RULING PARTY HAS BEEN THE CLEAR AND EXCESSIVE </p><p>WRONG DOER TO DATE.  AFTER AGAIN SINGING A PSALM OF </p><p>THE MERITS OF PEACE, THE WAR VETERAN AND CABINET </p><p>MEMBER REITERATED THE RULING PARTY\'S WISE, NEW, </p><p>PEACE-FOCUSED PUBLIC RELATIONS CAMPAIGN, AND AGAIN </p><p>BLAMED THE OPPOSITION FOR CAUSING VIOLENCE.  HE </p><p>PROUDLY CITED THE EXAMPLE OF THE AFTER-BUSINESS-HOURS </p><p>POSTERING OF ZANU-PF HEADQUARTERS IN CHINHOYI WITH </p><p>MDC (MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE) POSTERS BY </p><p>UNKNOWN PERPETRATORS.  "IMAGINE THE VIOLENCE THAT </p><p>SUCH AN ACT WOULD HAVE CAUSED", HE PLEADED, "IF </p><p>ANYONE HAD BEEN IN THE BUILDING."  WHEN THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR RAISED THE ALLEGATIONS OF TORTURE METED </p><p>OUT WITHIN HITLER HUNZVI\'S MEDICAL SURGERY, THE </p><p>MINISTER COULD ONLY REPEAT A MANTRA OF "UNPALATABLE, </p><p>UNPALATABLE...." </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) WHEN THE AMBASSADOR RAISED THE BEATINGS AND </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03094  01 OF 02  081537Z </p><p>INTIMIDATION OF EDUCATORS (CITING RAPES, </p><p>HOUSEBURNINGS AND NEAR-FATAL BEATINGS), THE MINISTER </p><p>INFORMED US THAT TEACHERS WHO DIGRESS FROM THE </p><p>CURRICULUM TO PREACH THE MERITS OF THE OPPOSITION </p><p>MUST BE DISCIPLINED; THOUGH HE SUBSEQUENTLY ADMITTED </p><p>THAT AN ADMINISTRATIVE MEANS EXISTED FOR THIS.  WHEN </p><p>ECONOFF POINTED OUT THAT FOR YEARS THE RULING PARTY </p><p>HAS DIRECTED AND ENCOURAGED TEACHERS TO DIGRESS FROM </p><p>THE CURRICULUM AND PREACH THE MERITS OF ZANU-PF; MOYO </p><p>RESPONDED THAT THIS WAS ONLY THE INCULCATION OF </p><p>"HISTORY", WHICH NONE COULD FIND FAULT WITH.  "THE </p><p>STORY OF THE LIBERATION STRUGGLE AND THE GLORIOUS </p><p>ROLE OF ZANU-PF IN ITS SUCCESS" HE CROONED, "IS OUR </p><p>NATIONAL HERITAGE AND CAN NEVER BE QUESTIONED OR </p><p>DENIED US."  "I AM A VETERAN AND IT IS OUR RIGHT", HE </p><p>SUMMARILY DECLARED, AS HE HASTENED OFF TO A MEETING </p><p>WITH A DELEGATION OF SOUTH AFRICAN ELECTION </p><p>OBSERVERS. </p><p> </p><p>5. COMMENT: WE CAME, SPOKE SERIOUSLY, AND MINISTER </p><p>MOYO PERFORMED.  FROM OUR OBSERVATION HE NEVER ONCE </p><p>STEPPED OUT OF HIS ACCOMPLISHED PLAYACTING.
