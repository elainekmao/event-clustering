<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABU DHABI 002234 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARP AND NEA/NGA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/07/13 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, UNSC, GCC, SA, TC </p><p>SUBJECT:  AS REGIONAL POWER CENTER SHIFTS, UAE </p><p>NO LONGER TAKING TUTELAGE FROM RIYADH </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba </p><p>for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) During a May 7 meeting with the Ambassador, </p><p>MFA Minstate Hamdan bin Zayid Al-Nahyan shared the </p><p>substance of a spat he had with Saudi Crown Prince </p><p>Abdullah.  Apparently, Abdullah had told an Arab </p><p>expat (well known in Gulf circles for his </p><p>connections to GCC leaders) that he was extremely </p><p>displeased that the Emiratis had decided to send a </p><p>representative to the April 28 Baghdad "tent </p><p>meeting."  Saudi Arabia had decided against such </p><p>representation and believed that the smaller GCC </p><p>states should have followed suit.  An incensed </p><p>Hamdan had asked the conduit to send the following </p><p>back to Abdullah:  "The UAE is a sovereign state </p><p>which neither takes orders nor waits to see what </p><p>direction others take before making decisions.  The </p><p>regional situation has changed and the Saudi </p><p>leadership should not behave as it did 10 years </p><p>ago." </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) COMMENT:  Anticipating a potential shift in </p><p>the center of power from Riyadh to points </p><p>northward, it appears that Abu Dhabi is already </p><p>chafing at the Saudi suggestion that the Emiratis </p><p>should continue to take their cues on policy </p><p>decisions from their Saudi brothers.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
