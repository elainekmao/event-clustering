<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 008358 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/16/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PINS, PINR, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: AK PARTY TO FORM NEW TURKISH GOVERNMENT WITH </p><p>ABDULLAH GUL AS PRIME MINISTER </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ANKARA 8310 </p><p>     B. ANKARA 8165 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by DCM Robert Deutsch; reasons: 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Nov. 16 President Sezer gave the mandate to form the </p><p>new Turkish government to AK Party number two Abdullah Gul </p><p>(ref A), who announced he will submit his proposed cabinet </p><p>list to Sezer Nov. 18.  We expect the government to be in </p><p>office a week to ten days thereafter.  Gul bio in para 5. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) To underscore to both the Turkish Establishment and </p><p>voters that he remains firmly in charge of AK Party and will </p><p>dominate policy-making, party chairman Erdogan held a </p><p>concurrent press conference to announce AK\'s one-year </p><p>emergency action plan.  It was clear from TV coverage, which </p><p>focused on Erdogan, not on Gul\'s visit to the presidency, </p><p>that the country understands.  It is the general expectation </p><p>that AK will pursue amendments to the constitution and other </p><p>legal remedies to allow Erdogan to become P.M. in several </p><p>months (ref B). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) The party program, which will become the new GOT\'s </p><p>program, calls among other things for: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--intensified efforts to reach EU standards of democracy; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--continued close work with the IMF; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--rapid action to combat unemployment (the number one voter </p><p>issue in Turkey), make the budget process more efficient and </p><p>more comprehensive (i.e., bring all but municipal budgets </p><p>under the central budget authority); </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--transparency in Turkish governance (Erdogan pointedly </p><p>announced that the program is downloadable from AK\'s web site </p><p>"so that everyone in Turkey can see how well we stick to our </p><p>program"). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) In the follow-on question and answer period Erdogan, </p><p>who has now departed to pay a flying visit to northern </p><p>Cyprus, in underscoring AK\'s intention to be pragmatic and </p><p>open-minded on the UN plan to reach a Cyprus settlement, </p><p>acknowledged the need for compromise on both sides.  (Note: </p><p>in a private meeting with us Nov. 15, AK Party number three </p><p>and probable speaker of Parliament Bulent Arinc criticized </p><p>the culture of nay-saying in the Turkish MFA with regard to </p><p>Cyprus and other regional issues.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Gul bio: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Abdullah Gul was born in 1950 into a poor but pious </p><p>working-class family in Kayseri in the Anatolian heartland </p><p>(father was a lathe operator).  Graduated from Istanbul U. </p><p>economics faculty.  Served as an associate professor of </p><p>industrial engineering at Sakarya U.  Has the title of </p><p>Associate Professor of Economics.  In the 1980\'s employed as </p><p>an economic expert at the Islamic Development Bank in Jiddah. </p><p> Entered Parliament in 1991 with the Islamist Refah Party of </p><p>Necmettin Erbakan.  Served as a State Minister with foreign </p><p>policy responsibilities (in effect an internal shadow FonMin </p><p>given Refah\'s distrust of coalition partner and FonMin Tansu </p><p>Ciller) in the 1996-97 Erbakan-led government.  Stayed with </p><p>Erbakan in Fazilet Party, which was formed after Refah was </p><p>banned, but then launched a reformist movement and  narrowly </p><p>lost a direct challenge to Erbakan\'s hand-picked Fazilet </p><p>leader Recai Kutan for the party chairmanship.  A founder of </p><p>AK Party in 2001.  Speaks Arabic and fluent English. </p><p>Married, three children. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Gul is a long-time, close contact of Embassy Ankara.  He </p><p>has an excellent understanding of the American mind and of </p><p>U.S. foreign policy priorities.  For years he served as a de </p><p>facto spokesman -- judged to be reasonable and open-minded by </p><p>Western and Islamist interlocutors -- for Refah and Fazilet </p><p>and has been an influential and moderate voice for </p><p>Islam-oriented politics in Turkey.  A number of long-standing </p><p>embassy contacts has told us consistently that the </p><p>relationship between Gul and party chairman Erdogan is </p><p>complex.  He is loyal to Erdogan but has his own ambitions </p><p>and occasionally in comments to us has chafed at his </p><p>subordination to the more rough-edged Erdogan.  Both came </p><p>through the Erbakan movement ranks together with Gul </p><p>representing the more technocratic stream.  While Erdogan is </p><p>far and away the most popular figure in AK, Gul has strong </p><p>grass-roots and parliamentary support of his own and has </p><p>built a formidable network of relations with politicians of </p><p>all stripes, bureaucrats, academics, and journalists. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Gul has an obliging (mulayim) and courteous character </p><p>stemming from his modest and very pious upbringing.  His </p><p>faith in Islam is rock solid, as is his courage of </p><p>convictions: Gul is no pushover.  Comfortable with </p><p>intellectual and political give-and-take, he nevertheless </p><p>maintains his principles and is sincere in the belief that </p><p>Turkey must accept women in Islamic headscarves as full </p><p>participants in society.  His wife passed the university </p><p>entrance exam but was denied matriculation owing to her </p><p>wearing of an Islamic headscarf; she currently has a case </p><p>against the Turkish government on this issue before the </p><p>European Court of Human Rights.  He also firmly believes in </p><p>the need to redress the current imbalance in </p><p>civilian-military relations, privately telling us </p><p>forthrightly that if pushing this kind of democratic reform </p><p>would be considered "destabilizing" by the Kemalist </p><p>Establishment, "then so be it."  This kind of comment, </p><p>combined with Gul\'s knowledge of the system and his smooth </p><p>manner, leads some Kemalist circles to fear that he would </p><p>succeed in implementing an Islamist agenda effectively.  Gul </p><p>has the serene but focused temperament (huzur) similar to </p><p>that of late president Turgut Ozal.  At the same time he is </p><p>untainted by the corruption surrounding the Ozal family and </p><p>government. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
