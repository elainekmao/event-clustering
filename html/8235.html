<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L LAGOS 001088 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/19/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, ELAB, KDEM, NI, PGOV </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: OIL WORKERS THREATEN STRIKE IN RESPONSE </p><p>TO ALLEGED TRANSOCEAN DISMISSALS </p><p> </p><p> 1.  Peter Akpatason, president of the National Union of </p><p>Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers of Nigeria (NUPENG), has </p><p>threatened to call "a national strike wherein the entire oil </p><p>industry will be shut down" unless Houston-based Transocean </p><p>Inc. rescinds the dismissal of 116 Nigerian workers who </p><p>participated in a wildcat protest aboard several offshore </p><p>rigs in April. The protesters held hundreds of Transocean </p><p>employees hostage, including twenty-one Americans, during the </p><p>two-week standoff. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  In addition to the layoffs, Akpatason accused Transocean </p><p>of discrimination, citing the company\'s use of helicopters </p><p>to carry expatriates to oil rigs while transporting Nigerian </p><p>workers in poorly maintained boats.  He said NUPENG is </p><p>"ready to face the consequences" as the union prepares to </p><p>disrupt the producing, servicing, refinery, distribution, and </p><p>upstream sectors. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  Joseph Akinlaja, General Secretary of NUPENG, told </p><p>Laboff that he has been involved in private discussions with </p><p>the Port Harcourt zone of NUPENG regarding the potential </p><p>strike.  However, he was surprised to learn that Akpatason </p><p>had already issued a public statement without first </p><p>consulting him.  Akinlaja expressed concern that Akpatason </p><p>made the remarks out of anger, adding that a strike action </p><p>cannot take effect until the National Executive Council of </p><p>NUPENG endorses it. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  Akinlaja and Akpatason departed Lagos for Memphis, </p><p>Tennessee on May 17 for a two-week workshop for union </p><p>leaders.  Akinlaja said a NUPENG strike action in their </p><p>absence is highly unlikely. </p><p>HINSON-JONES </p><p></p></div>
