<p>UNCLAS HARARE 000906 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PDPA FOR DALTON, MITCHELL AND SIMS </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: INDEPENDENT PAPER PRAISES COURT DECISION ON </p><p>MEDIA CONTROL LAW </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under headline "A step in the right direction" </p><p>      the independent daily "The Daily News" dedicated its </p><p>      May 9 editorial to hailing a recent Supreme Court </p><p>      ruling that annulled two sections of the Access to </p><p>      Information and Protection of Privacy Act (AIPPA) </p><p>      impinging on press freedom.  Excerpts follow: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   "All right-thinking Zimbabweans must applaud the </p><p>      Supreme Court\'s bold decision to strike down as </p><p>      unconstitutional Section 80 (1) (b) and (2) of </p><p>      the government\'s Soviet-style Access to </p><p>      Information and Protection of Privacy Act </p><p>      (AIIPA).  That a government in this day and age </p><p>      could even think of enacting a law that </p><p>      virtually criminalizes journalism, as the AIPPA </p><p>      clause struck down by the court did, is </p><p>      reprehensible in any democracy.  Even one as </p><p>      dubious as Zimbabwe. . .  And we urge the </p><p>      judiciary to continue the commendable process it </p><p>      has begun and nullify one-by-one the various </p><p>      provisions of AIPPA that militate against media </p><p>      freedom. . ." </p><p> </p><p>WHITEHEAD </p><p></p></div>
