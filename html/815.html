CLASSIFIED BY JAMES T. HEG, ACTING POLITICAL </p><p>COUNSELOR, EMBASSY ANKARA.  REASON 1.5 (B). </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  ON JANUARY 24, ACTING POLCOUNS AND POLOFF </p><p>CALLED ON ABDULLAH GUL, VICE-CHAIRMAN AND KAYSERI </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY DEPUTY OF THE ISLAMIST REFAH (WELFARE) </p><p>PARTY, TO GET THE LATEST REFAH THINKING ON TURKISH </p><p>POLITICS.  ACCORDING TO GUL: </p><p> </p><p>--REFAH, WHICH WON THE DECEMBER 24 GENERAL ELECTIONS </p><p>WITH 21.5 PERCENT OF THE VOTE, COULD HAVE TALLIED 25-26 </p><p>PERCENT.  HE ATTRIBUTED THE DIFFERENCE TO SEVERAL </p><p>FACTORS, INCLUDING: THE LACK OF FEMALE CANDIDATES AND </p><p>OTHER POOR CANDIDATE CHOICES; RHETORICAL "EXAGGERATIONS" </p><p>THAT MAY HAVE SCARED OFF SOME VOTERS; AND "CLEVER" </p><p>MAINSTREAM MEDIA ATTACKS AGAINST REFAH. </p><p> </p><p>--THE ELECTION CAMPAIGN OF THE (NOMINALLY SOCIALIST) </p><p>PRO-KURDISH PEOPLE\'S DEMOCRACY PARTY (HADEP) ALSO COST </p><p>REFAH SOME VOTES.  NEVERTHELESS, HADEP\'S RELATIVELY POOR </p><p>OVERALL SHOWING INDICATED THAT IT COULD NOT CAPTURE THE </p><p>HEARTS OF THE "CONSERVATIVE" KURDS, WHO REJECTED LEFTIST </p><p>POLITICAL NOSTRUMS. </p><p> </p><p>--MANY OTHER PARTIES WOULD TRY TO ADOPT SOME OF REFAH\'S </p><p>ORGANIZATIONAL STRATEGY, BUT LACK THE </p><p>IDEOLOGICALLY-MOTIVATED PARTY CADRE THAT MAKE REFAH\'S </p><p>FAMOUS DOOR-TO-DOOR TACTICS SUCCESSFUL. </p><p> </p><p>--MOST OF THE MOTHERLAND PARTY (ANAP) ORGANIZATION, AND </p><p>A SIZEABLE CHUNK OF TANSU CILLER\'S TRUE PATH PARTY (DYP) </p><p>WOULD, ABSENT PRESSURE FROM THE PARTY LEADERSHIP, LEAN </p><p>TOWARD A PARTNERSHIP WITH REFAH.  A DYP-ANAP PARTNERSHIP </p><p>WOULD ULTIMATELY PROVE UNWORKABLE; ANAP WOULD EVENTUALLY </p><p>REJECT THE INCREASINGLY STATIST DYP. </p><p> </p><p>--REFAH\'S "ADIL DUZEN" (JUST ORDER) PLATFORM CONTAINED </p><p>SOME "EXAGGERATIONS," BUT THE PARTY WAS SERIOUS ABOUT </p><p>ITS COMMITMENT TO APPLY ISLAMIC ETHICS TO THE ECONOMY. </p><p>REFAH\'S "TRUE" POSITION ON TURKEY\'S ACCESSION TO THE EU </p><p>CUSTOMS UNION WAS SIMILAR TO ANAP\'S: THEY WOULD SEEK TO </p><p>RENEGOTIATE SOME OF THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>--REFAH WAS AGAINST EXTENDING OPERATION PROVIDE COMFORT, </p><p>WHICH CREATES A POWER VACUUM IN NORTHERN IRAQ THAT THE </p><p>SEPARATIST KURDISTAN WORKERS\' PARTY (PKK) EXPLOITS TO </p><p>TURKEY\'S DETRIMENT.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) IN A MEETING WITH ACTING POLCOUNS AND POLOFF </p><p>JANUARY 24, REFAH PARTY VICE CHAIRMAN ABDULLAH GUL SAID </p><p>THAT HE HAD EXPECTED REFAH TO WIN 25-26 PERCENT OF THE </p><p>VOTE IN THE DECEMBER 24 GENERAL ELECTIONS, RATHER THAN </p><p></p><p>THE 21.5 PERCENT IT ACTUALLY TALLIED.  HE ATTRIBUTED THE </p><p>DIFFERENCE TO: THE LACK OF FEMALE CANDIDATES (HE </p><p>INDICATED THAT THIS WOULD BE REMEDIED NEXT TIME); THE </p><p>PRESENCE OF SOME UNCHARISMATIC OLD-TIMERS ON THE REFAH </p><p>CANDIDATE SLATE; "EXAGGERATED" RHETORIC INTENDED TO </p><p>CLEARLY DISTINGUISH REFAH FROM THE PACK AND ENERGIZE THE </p><p>PARTY CADRE, BUT WHICH MAY HAVE ALIENATED SOME VOTERS; </p><p>AND MORE "CLEVER AND INDIRECT" MAINSTREAM MEDIA ATTACKS </p><p>AGAINST THE PARTY.  HE ALSO NOTED THAT THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>PARTIES, WITH THEIR ACCESS TO PUBLIC COFFERS, HAD A </p><p>POTENTIAL ADVANTAGE OVER THE REST.  TO ILLUSTRATE HIS </p><p>POINT, HE CITED FORMER FINANCE MINISTER AYVAS GOKDEMIR, </p><p>WHO GUL AND PROVINCIAL NEWSPAPERS CLAIMED WON A SEAT </p><p>FROM KAYSERI ON THE DYP TICKET BY LITERALLY BUYING VOTES </p><p>WITH PUBLIC CASH. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) ACCORDING TO GUL, THE CHANGES IN THE ELECTORAL </p><p>LAWS BEFORE THE ELECTION HURT REFAH.  IN KAYSERI, HE </p><p>SAID, REFAH WON 34 PERCENT AND FOUR SEATS IN PARLIAMENT </p><p>TO THE 14 PERCENT EACH FOR THE MOTHERLAND PARTY (ANAP) </p><p>AND TANSU CILLER\'S TRUE PATH PARTY (DYP).  HAD </p><p>PROVINCIAL BARRAGES NOT BEEN ABANDONED ALTOGETHER BEFORE </p><p>THE ELECTIONS AT THE BEHEST OF THE DYP-LED GOVERNMENT -- </p><p>WHICH HAD INITIALLY SOUGHT A 15 PERCENT BARRIER -- REFAH </p><p>WOULD HAVE SWEPT KAYSERI.  GUL NOTED THAT THE BARRAGES </p><p>WERE NOT "JUST," BUT EXPRESSED AMUSEMENT AT THE PREVIOUS </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S SUDDEN SEARCH FOR EQUITY IN THE FACE OF A </p><p>REFAH CHALLENGE. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>THE HADEP FACTOR: THANK GOD THEY\'RE LEFTISTS </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) GUL NOTED THAT THE ENTRY OF THE PRO-KURDISH </p><p>PEOPLE\'S DEMOCRACY PARTY (HADEP) INTO THE RACE COST </p><p>REFAH SOME SUPPORT IN DIYARBAKIR AND ELSEWHERE, BUT </p><p>CLAIMED THAT REFAH\'S MISTAKES HELPED CONTRIBUTE TO </p><p>HADEP\'S SUCCESS IN SOME REGIONS.  HE VOLUNTEERED THAT </p><p>THE PROVINCIAL REFAH ORGANIZATIONS IN THE SOUTHEAST </p><p>"WERE RIGHT" TO PROTEST THE REFAH LEADERSHIP\'S DECISION </p><p>TO RUN RELATIVE NON-ENTITIES AGAINST POPULAR LOCALS. </p><p>REFAH, HE SAID, HAD STUMBLED BADLY BY DECIDING AT THE </p><p>LAST MINUTE TO DROP A POPULAR KURDISH IMAM FROM THE </p><p>DIYARBAKIR SLATE, INDICATING THAT THE PROSPECTIVE </p><p>CANDIDATE\'S AGGRESSIVELY ACTIVIST STANCE CAUSED SOME </p><p>UNEASE AMONG THE PARTY BRASS.  HE ASSERTED, HOWEVER, </p><p>THAT MOST IF NOT ALL OF REFAH\'S EASTERN DEPUTIES WERE </p><p>KURDS. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) THAT HADEP SECURED ONLY 4.5 PERCENT OF THE VOTE </p><p>(AND THUS FAILED TO GET OVER THE NATIONAL 10 PERCENT </p><p>BARRAGE AND ENTER PARLIAMENT), SAID GUL, INDICATED THAT </p><p>HADEP "DOES NOT HAVE THE CONFIDENCE OF THE KURDS."  HE </p><p>POINTED OUT THAT MOST KURDS NOW LIVED IN WESTERN TURKEY, </p><p>WHERE HADEP RECEIVED NEGLIGIBLE SUPPORT.  WITH EVIDENT </p><p>RESPECT, GUL OFFERED THAT HADEP\'S LEADERS HAD INDEED </p><p>FOUGHT FOR THE KURDISH CAUSE.  HE EMPHASIZED, HOWEVER, </p><p>THAT "NONE OF THEM REALLY LIVED LIKE KURDS."  THE HADEP </p><p>LEADERSHIP\'S ROOTS EXTEND BACK TO THE FAR LEFT OF THE </p><p>POLITICAL SPECTRUM, WHEREAS THEIR KURDISH CONSTITUENTS </p><p>WERE "THE MOST CONSERVATIVE (READ, TRADITIONAL AND </p><p>RELIGIOUS) PEOPLE IN TURKEY."  GUL ACKNOWLEDGED THAT </p><p>HADEP RAN IMAMS ON ITS TICKET IN SIIRT PROVINCE, AND WAS </p><p>SUPPORTED BY NAKSHIBENDI SHAYKH ABDULMELIK FIRAT (NOTE: </p><p>FIRAT WAS RECENTLY ARRESTED AMIDST MUCH PUBLIC OUTCRY </p><p>FOR ALLEGEDLY SHELTERING A KURDISTAN WORKERS\' PARTY </p><p>MEMBER - PKK - IN 1992.  HE IS THE GRANDSON OF SHAYKH </p><p>SAIT, WHO LED THE FIRST KURDISH REBELLION AGAINST </p><p>ATATURK IN THE 1920S.  BEFORE HIS ARREST, PRESS REPORTS </p><p>INDICATED THAT FIRAT WAS TRYING TO FORM A NEW POLITICAL </p><p>PARTY WITH ISLAMIST INTELLECTUAL AND FORMER REFAH </p><p>DEPUTY HASAN MESARCI.  END NOTE).  GUL SAID, HOWEVER, </p><p>THAT HADEP\'S TACTICS -- ABSENT A REAL "STRATEGIC" CHANGE </p><p>OF HEART -- WERE LARGELY "UNCONVINCING" TO RELIGIOUS </p><p>KURDS; PKK LEADER OCALAN, GUL NOTED, ROUTINELY </p><p>CONGRATULATED KURDS WHO COMPLETED A "HAJ" -- PILGRIMAGE </p><p>-- TO MECCA.  HE SUGGESTED THAT HADEP COULD HAVE DONE </p><p>BETTER IF IT HAD BEGUN ON THE "CONSERVATIVE" SIDE; </p><p>"WE\'RE THANKFUL", HE ADDED, "THAT THEY DIDN\'T." </p><p></p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>OFTEN IMITATED, NEVER DUPLICATED </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) GUL SAID THAT, DUE TO REFAH\'S ACCOMPLISHMENTS IN </p><p>1994 AND 1995, OTHER PARTIES WERE TRYING TO EMULATE </p><p>REFAH\'S NOW-FAMOUS ORGANIZATIONAL SKILLS, BUT WERE </p><p>UNLIKELY TO SUCCEED.  "WE," HE SAID, "HAVE TRUE </p><p>BELIEVERS" IN THE RANKS WHO WERE WILLING TO DO THE </p><p>DAY-TO-DAY CANVASSING AND OTHER POLITICAL WORK FOR </p><p>NOTHING IN RETURN.  GUL SAID THAT ANAP DEPUTY VEHBI </p><p>DINCERLER AND CENTER-LEFT REPUBLICAN PEOPLE\'S PARTY </p><p>(CHP) DEPUTY ISMAIL CEM HAD TOLD HIM THAT NOT ONLY DID </p><p>THEIR PARTIES LACK AN IDEOLOGICALLY-MOTIVATED CADRE, </p><p>PARTY MORALE WAS SO LOW THAT POLITICIANS HAD TO PAY </p><p>PEOPLE TO WORK THE LOUDSPEAKERS AND "EVEN TO SIT WITH </p><p>THE CANDIDATES" ON CAMPAIGN BUSES.  ON THE OTHER HAND, </p><p>HE SAID, REFAH SUPPORTERS DID NOT EXPECT SUCH LARGESSE </p><p>FROM THE PARTY.  GUL POINTED TO THE FACT THAT THE </p><p>REFAH-CONTROLLED PAYROLL IN ISTANBUL HAD ACTUALLY </p><p>DECREASED FROM 44,000 TO 38,000 EMPLOYEES DURING REFAH </p><p>MAYOR RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN\'S TENURE; ANKARA HAD </p><p>WITNESSED A SIMILAR DECLINE IN THE MUNICIPAL WORKFORCE </p><p>UNDER REFAH MAYOR MELIH GOKCEK.  DESPITE THIS, REFAH DID </p><p>WELL IN BOTH CITIES. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>COALITION-BUILDING </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) DURING THE CAMPAIGN, GUL SAID, PARTIES HAD A </p><p>"DUTY TO SHOW THEIR REAL FACE TO THE PUBLIC."  A NEW </p><p>REALITY NOW CONFRONTED REFAH, HOWEVER.  THE PARTY, HE </p><p>SAID, HAD DEMONSTRATED THAT IT WAS WILLING TO COMPROMISE </p><p>-- IT WAS NOW UP TO OTHERS TO DO THE SAME.  THE GREAT </p><p>MAJORITY OF ANAP\'S PROVINCIAL ORGANIZATIONS -- SOME 80 </p><p>PERCENT OF THE PARTY CADRE, HE ASSERTED -- AND ABOUT </p><p>HALF OF DYP, WANTED A PARTNERSHIP WITH REFAH.  ABSENT </p><p>PRESSURE FROM "MONARCHICAL" PARTY LEADERS, ABOUT 60 </p><p>PERCENT OF ANAP AND 40 PERCENT OF DYP DEPUTIES WOULD </p><p>LEAN TOWARD REFAH, GUL ASSERTED. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) "ANAYOL" (AN ANAP-DYP PARTNERSHIP) WON\'T WORK," </p><p>GUL PREDICTED; ANAP WOULD EVENTUALLY REJECT DYP, WHICH </p><p>AS A RESULT OF THE ELECTIONS HAD BECOME MORE OF A </p><p>STATIST PARTY.  HE ETCHED A PARALLEL WITH THE 1950\'S, </p><p>WHEN THE STATIST CHP FOUGHT IT OUT WITH ADNAN MENDERES\' </p><p>OLD DEMOCRAT PARTY (DP).  DYP, LIKE THE CHP OF THAT ERA, </p><p>DREW ITS CANDIDATES FROM THE STATE BUREAUCRACIES, THE </p><p>POLICE, AND THE MILITARY.  LIKE THE OLD "ELITIST" CHP, </p><p>DYP FELT "ASHAMED" OF THE ACTUAL, LIVE VOTERS IT HOPED </p><p>TO ENLIGHTEN THROUGH WESTERNIZATION.  MEANWHILE REFAH, </p><p>GUL SAID, OWED ITS ELECTORAL SUCCESSES TO A POPULIST </p><p>PLATFORM WHICH PROMOTED SUPPORT FOR ISLAM.  HE OBSERVED </p><p>THAT THE GROWING MAINSTREAM FLIRTATION WITH RELIGIOUS </p><p>VALUES REPRESENTED THE EMERGENCE OF TURKEY\'S "TRUE </p><p>FACE."  THIS HEALTHY DEVELOPMENT WAS LONG OVERDUE; </p><p>CONTINUED STATE PRESSURE AGAINST THE EXPRESSION OF </p><p>RELIGIOUS POLITICAL SENTIMENTS WOULD BE DANGEROUS FOR </p><p>TURKISH STABILITY, GUL ASSERTED. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>WHAT IS TO BE DONE? </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) GUL SAID THAT "ADIL DUZEN" (THE PARTY\'S "JUST </p><p>ORDER" PLATFORM) WAS LARGELY "PROPAGANDA" THAT FEATURED </p><p>TOO MANY OF REFAH LEADER ERBAKAN\'S "EXAGGERATIONS." </p><p>NEVERTHELESS, REFAH WAS SERIOUS ABOUT ITS COMMITMENT TO </p><p>ISLAMIC PRINCIPLES.  GUL SAID FOR EXAMPLE THAT MOST </p><p>TURKISH CITIZENS ("MYSELF INCLUDED") FOR RELIGIOUS </p><p>REASONS WOULD PREFER AN ALTERNATIVE TO LENDING MONEY AT </p><p>INTEREST.  HE NOTED, HOWEVER, THAT AL BARAKA TURK AND </p><p>OTHER PRIVATE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT USED ISLAMIC </p><p>RISK-SHARING SCHEMES IN LIEU OF INTEREST WERE IN FACT </p><p>PROHIBITED BY LAW FROM ACTUALLY FULLY IMPLEMENTING THESE </p><p>PROGRAMS.  THE STATE, GUL LAMENTED, WORRIED THAT SUCH </p><p>INSTITUTIONS AND PRACTICES WERE DANGERS TO SECULARISM; </p><p>REFAH SAW THEM AS "JUST BUSINESS."  (COMMENT:  AL BARAKA </p><p>TURK\'S ANKARA BRANCH DIRECTOR OSMAN KARA RECENTLY </p><p>COMPLAINED TO POLOFF THAT EXISTING LAW DID NOT ALLOW </p><p>SUCH PRIVATE FIRMS TO MAKE INVESTMENTS ALONG THE LINES </p><p>OF STATE BANKS.  END COMMENT). </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>FOREIGN POLICY ISSUES </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) GUL ALSO NOTED THAT ERBAKAN\'S OPPOSITION TO </p><p>TURKISH ACCESSION TO THE EUROPEAN CUSTOMS UNION WAS </p><p>SIMILARLY "EXAGGERATED" FOR CAMPAIGN PURPOSES.  (NOTE: </p><p>ERBAKAN PUBLICLY CALLED THE CU "A UNION OF INFIDELS" IN </p><p>THE DAYS BEFORE THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT RATIFIED </p><p>TURKEY\'S ENTRY.  END NOTE).  REFAH\'S "TRUE" POSITION, AS </p><p>GUL HAD STATED PUBLICLY IN EARLY DECEMBER, WAS SIMILAR </p><p>TO ANAP\'S.  REFAH WOULD SUPPORT ENTRY INTO THE CUSTOMS </p><p>UNION, BUT WOULD SEEK TO RENEGOTIATE SOME OF THE TERMS </p><p>(PARTICULARLY, THOSE WHICH DEALT WITH TARIFF AND OTHER </p><p>TRADE RELATIONS WITH THIRD COUNTRIES).  HE ALSO </p><p>REITERATED HIS VIEW (REPORTED REFTEL) THAT REFAH\'S </p><p>MISGIVINGS ABOUT A TURKISH LOSS OF SOVEREIGNTY IN THE </p><p>EVENT OF FULL EU MEMBERSHIP WERE SIMILAR TO THOSE HELD </p><p>BY DENMARK AND OTHER WESTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES.  GUL </p><p>ADDED THAT REFAH WAS NOT OPPOSED TO TIES WITH THE U.S. </p><p>AND EUROPE.  HE REMARKED THAT THE TYPICAL REFAH MEMBER </p><p>HAD SPENT MUCH MORE TIME IN EUROPE THAN IN OTHER ISLAMIC </p><p>COUNTRIES. </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) TURNING TO OPERATION PROVIDE COMFORT (PC II), </p><p>GUL SAID REFAH DID NOT WISH TO SEE SECULAR STATIST </p><p>GOVERNMENTS IN THE MIDDLE EAST; HE OBSERVED THAT SADDAM </p><p>IN IRAQ AND ASSAD IN SYRIA WERE BOTH BAATHISTS, NOT </p><p>MUSLIMS.  REFAH, HE OBSERVED, HAD ALWAYS OPPOSED PC II, </p><p>WHICH HE SAID CREATED A POWER VACUUM IN THE NORTH AND </p><p>FUELED TURKEY\'S PROBLEMS WITH THE PKK. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>A ROSE BY ANY OTHER NAME... </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) COMMENT:  GUL (WHOSE NAME MEANS "ROSE" IN </p><p>TURKISH) IS THE PARTY OFFICIAL RESPONSIBLE FOR PUTTING </p><p>THE BEST POSSIBLE SPIN ON THE IMAGE THAT ERBAKAN WOULD </p><p>LIKE TO PRESENT TO WESTERNERS -- THAT IS, THAT REFAH IS </p><p>AN ISLAMIC VERSION OF EUROPE\'S CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS. </p><p>MANY OF HIS REMARKS STRESSED THE REFAH PARTY\'S ROOTS IN </p><p>MAINSTREAM TURKISH POLITICS GOING BACK TO THE 1950S.  HE </p><p>IS A THOUGHTFUL, CANDID OBSERVER AND APPARENTLY SINCERE </p><p>BELIEVER IN THE ISLAMIST MESSAGE.  THERE ARE INDICATIONS </p><p>THAT GUL, EVEN AT A RELATIVELY YOUNG AGE AND LEVEL OF </p><p>EXPERIENCE (HE WAS FIRST ELECTED TO PARLIAMENT IN 1991) </p><p>IS ATTEMPTING TO BUILD UP A FIEFDOM WITHIN REFAH BASED </p><p>ON THE SUPPORT OF OTHER YOUNG, LIKE-MINDED DEPUTIES AND </p><p>OTHER OFFICIALS.  IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO WATCH HOW </p><p>(AND TO WHAT EXTENT HE IS GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY) HE HELPS </p><p>MANAGE RELATIONS BETWEEN THE RELATIVELY WORLDLY PARTY </p><p>MEMBERS WHO WANT TO REACH A MODUS VIVENDI WITH THE WEST, </p><p>AND THE MORE RADICAL AND CONFRONTATIONAL ELEMENTS WITHIN </p><p>REFAH. </p><p> </p><p>GROSSMAN </p><p></p></div>
