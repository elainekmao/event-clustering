<p>UNCLAS SANAA 001368 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NEA/EPA: EROMANOWSKI, NEA/EPA: CBOURGEOIS, NEA/PPD: </p><p>DMACINNES, NEA/PPD: ACASPER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, OEXC, SCUL </p><p>SUBJECT: MEPI - ARABIC BOOK TRANSLATION PROGRAM, AMEMBASSY </p><p>SANAA PARTICIPATION </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 145089 </p><p> </p><p>1. Post requests inclusion in the Arabic Book Translation </p><p>Program. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>Answers to Questions </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  PAO, John Balian, recently spoke with officials from the </p><p>Ministry of Education regarding the proposed project. </p><p> </p><p>3.  MOE officials were enthusiastic about the program and </p><p>promised cooperation with Amembassy Sanaa in planning and </p><p>implementation of the project. </p><p> </p><p>4.  Post will work with appropriate host government officials </p><p>so that schools are ready to participate in the initial pilot </p><p>project to be launched in Fall 2003. </p><p> </p><p>5.  Host country is receptive to participating in both the </p><p>primary school and (future) upper grade programs. </p><p> </p><p>6.  Post believes that the classroom library set-up will be </p><p>effective. </p><p> </p><p>7.  Although the MOE does not have sufficient funds to offer </p><p>financial buy-in to the project, MOE is fully prepared to </p><p>work with Amembassy Sanaa in school selection and other forms </p><p>of cooperation necessary to make the project successful. </p><p> </p><p>8.  Post does not currently know the number of schools that </p><p>could be impacted by the initial roll-out of the program but </p><p>due to the desperate need of additional educational/reading </p><p>materials in the country\'s school system, the future impact </p><p>of the program could be impressive. </p><p> </p><p>9.  There is no local facility that can be used for printing </p><p>of the books. </p><p> </p><p>10. Post would work with media outlets in Yemen, in </p><p>cooperation with the ROYG to insure wide-spread media </p><p>coverage in all of the areas where the program is </p><p>implemented. </p><p> </p><p>11. The USG\'s profile in the roll-out of the program should </p><p>be high once books are actually donated to schools and </p><p>classroom libraries are established. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>Education in Yemen </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>12. Basic education and literacy is a fundamental component </p><p>of Post\'s MEPI strategy as there are many areas of education </p><p>that need to be addressed in Yemen. Only half of all Yemeni </p><p>children aged 6 to 11 enroll in schools, the literacy rate, </p><p>especially in the rural areas, is as high as 91 percent for </p><p>married women, and teachers often have minimum </p><p>qualifications.  The 2000/1 Education Survey estimated that </p><p>only 60 percent of teachers have just basic education, or at </p><p>most, one to two years of secondary school. </p><p> </p><p>13. Education has not historically been considered essential </p><p>among many Yemenis. However, the Yemeni Government is working </p><p>to improve the educational system.  The ROYG Poverty </p><p>Reduction Strategy Paper states that education is a key </p><p>factor in creating sustainable economic and social </p><p>development.  The education strategy in Yemen focuses on </p><p>improving the quality of education, improving the management </p><p>of the educational system, giving priority to basic education </p><p>and focusing on girls\' education. </p><p> </p><p>14. The Arabic Book Translation Program will work to help the </p><p>ROYG meet these objectives and will help meet some of the </p><p>education needs of the country, especially in rural areas </p><p>where illiteracy is most prevalent. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MISENHEIMER </p><p></p></div>
