<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L COLOMBO 001501 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS, LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL; NSC FOR </p><p>E. MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/15/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, PINR, PREL, PARM, CE, NO, Political Parties </p><p>SUBJECT: PRESIDENT KUMARATUNGA SAYS SHE WILL MEET RANIL ON </p><p>COHABITATION </p><p> </p><p>REF: COLOMBO 1491 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador E. Ashley Wills.  Reasons 1.5 B, D. </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  My dinner with President Kumaratunga last </p><p>night (August 14) went well.  She was vivacious, relaxed and </p><p>chatty.  We hardly discussed substance at all, but she did </p><p>say she will try to meet with Ranil before she leaves for the </p><p>UK this weekend.  She is prepared to discuss new terms for </p><p>cohabitation but would not reveal what she has in mind.  She </p><p>apologized for her brother\'s intemperate remarks re President </p><p>Bush (he did too).  My dog liked her.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) President Kumaratunga came to dinner last night </p><p>(August 14) at Jefferson House.  She arrived 90 minutes late </p><p>with her son - Wednesday\'s regular Cabinet meeting ran late - </p><p>and stayed until 0100.  Her sister, Sunetra, and her brother, </p><p>Anura, arrived before her and were pleasant companions. </p><p>Anura apologized for his remarks regarding President Bush\'s </p><p>election.  (Later in the evening, CBK pulled me aside and </p><p>apologized as well for what he said.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Our conversation was overwhelmingly light-hearted. </p><p>The President turned gossipy at various points, entertaining </p><p>us all with her earthy characterizations of various leading </p><p>figures in Sri Lankan public life.  It turns out she likes </p><p>bourbon, a sure sign of refinement.  She revealed a relaxed, </p><p>radiant personality that disarmed the Wills clan, including </p><p>my Golden Retriever, who disloyally sat beside the President </p><p>the whole evening. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) At a couple of points, we ventured into substance. </p><p>She confirmed that former Foreign Minister Kadirgamar is </p><p>trying to broker a meeting between her and the PM on </p><p>cohabitation, and she said she would try to meet with Ranil </p><p>before she leaves for the UK this weekend.  (She is away for </p><p>a week to spend time with her daughter and thus will not be </p><p>in country during the Depsec\'s visit.)  I told her the </p><p>obvious, namely that her and Ranil\'s bickering serves the </p><p>LTTE\'s interests, not Sri Lanka\'s.  She agreed.  She </p><p>acknowledged that some of her phrasing in her TV speech last </p><p>week was intemperate, but she blamed the UNP\'s constant </p><p>harassment of her for her lack of restraint.  All things </p><p>summed, she came across as reasonable and in full control of </p><p>her emotions and sense, an assessment I conveyed to the PM </p><p>this morning, per his request (see reftel). </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) COMMENT:  Chandrika can be beguiling and was on this </p><p>occasion.  I can see why she is so admired, especially but </p><p>not only by middle and lower income Sri Lankans who respond </p><p>well to her populist plain-speaking.  It was interesting to </p><p>see her having to put up with the good-natured ribbing of her </p><p>brother, sister and son.  Her humanity showed.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>Wills </p><p></p></div>
