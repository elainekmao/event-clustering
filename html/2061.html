<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 BEIJING 010339 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/12/11 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PTER, AF, PK </p><p>SUBJECT: PRC POSITION ON AFGHANISTAN\'S FUTURE </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A)STATE 176853, (B)BEIJING 10287 </p><p> </p><p>(U)  CLASSIFIED BY POLITICAL MINISTER COUNSELOR JON </p><p>ALOISI.  REASONS 1.5 (B), (D). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) AN MFA OFFICIAL ON OCTOBER 12 REPORTED THAT </p><p>CHINA\'S POSITION ON THE FUTURE OF AFGHANISTAN WAS </p><p>SIMILAR TO OURS, AS DESCRIBED IN REF A DEMARCHE. </p><p>BEIJING BELIEVED THE NEXT GOVERNMENT OF AFGHANISTAN </p><p>SHOULD BE BROADLY BASED, REPRESENT ALL ETHNIC GROUPS, </p><p>PURSUE FRIENDLY RELATIONS WITH ALL OTHER COUNTRIES, AND, </p><p>OF COURSE, OPPOSE TERRORISM.  THE OFFICIAL ALSO STRESSED </p><p>THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ROLE OF THE UNITED NATIONS IN </p><p>DETERMINING AFGHANISTAN\'S FUTURE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  EMBOFFS MET OCTOBER 12 WITH LI JUNHUA, DIRECTOR </p><p>OF THE MFA INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION DEPARTMENT\'S </p><p>POLITICAL DIVISION, TO DISCUSS REFTEL DEMARCHE ON </p><p>AFGHANISTAN\'S POLITICAL FUTURE.  WE LEFT THE TALKING </p><p>POINTS BEHIND AS A NONPAPER. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>CHINA\'S POSITION SIMILAR TO OURS </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  AFTER LISTENING TO OUR PRESENTATION, LI </p><p>RESPONDED THAT CHINA SHARED MOST OF OUR VIEWS.  BEIJING </p><p>BELIEVED THE NEXT AFGHAN GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE BROADLY </p><p>BASED, INCLUDE REPRESENTATIVES OF ALL ETHNIC GROUPS, AND </p><p>BE FRIENDLY TO ALL COUNTRIES.  LI REPEATED THE LAST </p><p>POINT, EMPHASIZING THAT AFGHANISTAN SHOULD NOT BE </p><p>HOSTILE TO ANY OTHER COUNTRY.  FINALLY, OF COURSE, IT </p><p>SHOULD OPPOSE TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>IMPORTANT ROLE OF UN </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  LI CONTINUED THAT CHINA ATTACHED GREAT </p><p>IMPORTANCE TO THE ROLE OF THE UN IN DETERMINING </p><p>AFGHANISTAN\'S FUTURE.  THE PRC WELCOMED THE APPOINTMENT </p><p>OF LAKHDAR BRAHIMI AS THE SECRETARY GENERAL\'S SPECIAL </p><p>ENVOY TO AFGHANISTAN.  CHINA WOULD WORK CLOSELY WITH </p><p>BRAHIMI AND HOPED THAT THE UN, PARTICULARLY THE </p><p>SECRETARY GENERAL HIMSELF, WOULD TAKE A MORE ACTIVE ROLE </p><p>IN AFGHANISTAN. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  "LAST BUT NOT LEAST," SAID LI, THE NEXT AFGHAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE DETERMINED BY THE AFGHAN PEOPLE. </p><p>IT WAS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY </p><p>TO CREATE A FAVORABLE ENVIRONMENT FOR THE AFGHAN PEOPLE </p><p>TO ACCOMPLISH THIS.  CHINA WAS READY TO WORK WITH THE </p><p>U.S., PAKISTAN, IRAN, AND OTHERS TO WORK OUT A SOLUTION </p><p>TO THE AFGHANISTAN ISSUE. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  LI\'S REMARKS AND VFM WANG YI\'S EARLIER COMMENTS </p><p>ON THE SAME SUBJECT TO A/S KELLY (REF B) REFLECT AN </p><p>INITIAL CONSENSUS WITHIN THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT ON THE </p><p>FUTURE OF AFGHANISTAN.  WE KNOW FROM OTHER SOURCES THAT </p><p>THE PRC HAS BEEN WORKING OVERTIME TO FORMULATE A </p><p>POSITION ON THE ISSUE (ONE SOUTH ASIA SCHOLAR SAID HE </p><p>HAD BEEN ATTENDING MEETINGS WITH THE MFA EVERY DAY). </p><p>BEIJING\'S FIRST PRIORITY IS A STABLE AFGHANISTAN, WHICH </p><p>THE PRC WILL DEFINE AS ONE THAT IS ACCEPTABLE TO </p><p>PAKISTAN, ABLE TO MAINTAIN STABILITY ON THE CHINESE- </p><p>AFGHAN BORDER, AND DOES NOT CONTRIBUTE TO SEPARATISM IN </p><p>CHINA\'S WEST.  THE PRC WILL ALSO BE ALERT TO ANY HINT </p><p>THAT THE U.S. MIGHT EXPLOIT THE CURRENT CRISIS TO </p><p>UNDERMINE CHINESE INFLUENCE IN CENTRAL ASIA. </p><p> </p><p>RANDT </p><p></p></div>
