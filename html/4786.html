<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 FRANKFURT 011732 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, GM </p><p>SUBJECT:  FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONAL COURT DECLARES IMMIGRATION </p><p>LAW UNCONSTITUTIONAL </p><p> </p><p>REF: BERLIN 1141 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) Summary: On December 18, the Federal Constitutional </p><p>Court in Karlsruhe declared unconstitutional the </p><p>government\'s immigration law, which had been passed by the </p><p>Bundesrat in March 2002 under controversial circumstances. </p><p>With this decision, the Court accepted the challenge to the </p><p>law by six opposition (CDU or CSU)-led states.  The </p><p>Karlsruhe decision is seen by many contacts as yet another </p><p>blow for the Schroeder Government and as welcome news for </p><p>Hesse Minister-President Roland Koch (CDU) in the final </p><p>weeks of the Hesse state election campaign.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) On March 22, 2002 the Bundesrat passed the </p><p>immigration law over the objections of the CDU/CSU </p><p>opposition (Reftel).  Bundesrat President Klaus Wowereit </p><p>(SPD) decided that the law had the required number of votes </p><p>by counting the split vote of the state of Brandenburg as </p><p>valid.  (Brandenburg is governed by a grand coalition of SPD </p><p>and CDU.)  While Minister President Manfred (SPD) voted with </p><p>yes, his coalition partner, Interior Minister Joerg </p><p>Schoenbohm (CDU), voted against it.  The six CDU and CSU </p><p>governed states of Bavaria, Baden-Wuerttemberg, Hesse, </p><p>Thuringa, Saxony and Saarland filed a lawsuit with the </p><p>Federal Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe, arguing that the </p><p>Bundesrat procedure violated the German Constitution. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) The eight judges of the Second Senate on December 18 </p><p>confirmed that the immigration law cannot go into effect on </p><p>January 1, 2003.  They held that, since the state of </p><p>Brandenburg did not vote unanimously, the vote was invalid. </p><p>The judges reconfirmed the constitutional requirement that a </p><p>state has to give a unanimous vote in the Bundesrat.  They </p><p>also stated that after the split vote had been given, </p><p>Bundesrat President Wowereit did not follow correct </p><p>procedures.  Vice President Winfried Hassemer, who announced </p><p>the verdict, stated that the decision was reached with a six- </p><p>to-two majority.  Judges Osterloh and Luebbe-Wolf (both SPD) </p><p>gave dissenting opinions. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) The B-W CDU expressed satisfaction with the </p><p>Karlsruhe decision.  Christoph Dahl, spokesperson of CDU </p><p>caucus at the Stuttgart State Parliament, told us that the </p><p>immigration law verdict is a heavy blow for the national </p><p>government in Berlin.  In the upcoming negotiations with SPD </p><p>and Greens, the CDU will try to modify the new immigration </p><p>law to better suit its political objectives.  Specifically, </p><p>the CDU/CSU will seek to limit and regulate immigration into </p><p>Germany to a greater extent and to focus more on the </p><p>integration of foreigners already resident in Germany.  Dahl </p><p>said he expects the SPD to accommodate the CDU, which in </p><p>turn might lead to increased tension between SPD and Greens. </p><p>Dahl also expects that Hesse M-P Roland Koch will exploit </p><p>the immigration issue for the final phase of his election </p><p>campaign. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) B-W Economics Minister Walter Doering (FDP) called </p><p>on all politicians to clarify the immigration issue as soon </p><p>as possible.  Immigration, according to Doering, is a </p><p>crucial issue for the future of the country and should not </p><p>become the subject of a political game.  For the B-W SPD, </p><p>the Karlsruhe decision was not unexpected.  Andreas Reissig, </p><p>press spokesman for the B-W SPD, told us that the SPD will </p><p>respect the Karlsruhe verdict.  The SPD still feels that </p><p>Germany needs a modern immigration law and will now start to </p><p>work constructively with all political parties to secure a </p><p>majority in the Bundesrat. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) Comment: The decision of the Federal Court in </p><p>Karlsruhe did not come as a surprise.  For several weeks, </p><p>all major media sources have reported rumors that Karlsruhe </p><p>would declare the immigration law unconstitutional.  For the </p><p>SPD-Greens coalition in Berlin the decision is not </p><p>unexpected, but is nevertheless a heavy blow, particularly </p><p>since the immigration law was considered a crowning SPD- </p><p>Greens achievement during the last legislative period.  The </p><p>best chance to bring a new immigration law through the CDU- </p><p>dominated Bundesrat is for the SPD and Greens to seek a </p><p>compromise with the CDU/CSU.  The media has already </p><p>reported, however, that Federal Interior Minister Schily </p><p>intends to introduce the same law to the Bundestag/Bundesrat </p><p>early next year.  The CDU/CSU will not consider this a </p><p>welcome move and could use the government\'s unwillingness to </p><p>compromise as an additional issue in the upcoming February </p><p>2, 2003 state elections in Hesse and Lower Saxony, something </p><p>the government would like to avoid. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) Comment Cont.: The SPD may prove to be more </p><p>cooperative than its Greens coalition partners as the party </p><p>would like to see immigration taken out of the state </p><p>election campaigns.  Already facing growing voter discontent </p><p>and poor poll numbers in Hesse and Lower Saxony, the SPD </p><p>would not want to see an emotionally charged issue like </p><p>immigration play a role in the elections.  A compromise with </p><p>the CDU/CSU could do this.  What is uncertain is how much </p><p>the Greens will be willing to compromise.  The CDU/CSU will </p><p>push for limits on immigration - something the Greens would </p><p>have problems with as this increases the chances, in their </p><p>minds, that politically or religiously persecuted people </p><p>could be denied entry to Germany.  If the SPD agrees to </p><p>limits on immigration, there could be trouble in the </p><p>coalition.  One thing is certain, Koch will use the court\'s </p><p>decision to maximize his chances for reelection in Hesse. </p><p>He did, after all, win the 1998 state elections on a </p><p>campaign platform that called for limiting immigration.  End </p><p>Comment. </p><p> </p><p>BODDE </p><p></p></div>
