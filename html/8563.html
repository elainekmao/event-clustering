<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 RANGOON 000665 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p>USPACOM FOR FPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/04/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, BM, ASSK </p><p>SUBJECT: RAZALI: NO ACCESS TO ASSK AS YET, MEETING WITH </p><p>MAUNG AYE ON JUNE 9 </p><p> </p><p>REF: RANGOON 664 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: COM CARMEN M. MARTINEZ FOR REASON 1.5(D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C)  Summary:  Late on June 7, Special Envoy Razali </p><p>briefed COM Martinez on his meeting earlier in the day with </p><p>SPDC Secretary One Khin Nyunt.  Khin Nyunt told Razali that </p><p>the crackdown on the NLD was in response to actions by ASSK </p><p>that constituted an unacceptable threat to the SPDC.  He </p><p>assured Razali that ASSK was in good health and provided two </p><p>photos dated May 31 to prove it.  Razali said he did not </p><p>contest Khin Nyunt\'s justification for the crackdown, </p><p>choosing instead to make the case that it was absolutely </p><p>essential that he gain access to her on this visit.  Khin </p><p>Nyunt said this was not his decision to make and asked for </p><p>Razali to make the case for access to ASSK directly to Vice </p><p>Senior General Maung Aye in a meeting early Monday.  The SE </p><p>is well aware that this may just be a ploy to wear out his </p><p>patience so he will leave and the SPDC can claim that he </p><p>"quit."  Razali is determined to go the last mile and see </p><p>Maung Aye, although he did not seem hopeful of the outcome. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  Special Envoy Razali and his team (Hitoki Den, Damon </p><p>Bristow, and Leon DeReidmatten) met with COM Martinez on June </p><p>7 to provide a read-out of his meeting earlier in the day </p><p>with SPDC Secretary One General Khin Nyunt.  In what he </p><p>termed "a long session" with Khin Nyunt, Razali said he made </p><p>a strong case for access to Aung San Suu Kyi (ASSK), saying, </p><p>among other things, that it would be an embarrassment to </p><p>ASEAN to not allow the Special Envoy access.  Razali said </p><p>Khin Nyunt responded with a long explanation of the SPDC\'s </p><p>perception that ASSK posed an unacceptable threat to the </p><p>state based on her recent actions.  Khin Nyunt provided </p><p>photos of crowds that have gathered to hear ASSK at various </p><p>stops and said she had begun to deviate from the agreement </p><p>she had with the SPDC on the parameters of her travel.  Khin </p><p>Nyunt said that in addition to the agreed to visits to NLD </p><p>offices, ASSK had begun impromptu visits to monasteries and </p><p>delivering roadside talks, often taking the opportunity to </p><p>criticize the government and the performance of civil </p><p>servants.  Khin Nyunt stated that the regime had evidence </p><p>that ASSK had also been meeting with other political parties, </p><p>some of whom had ties to groups responsible for recent </p><p>bombings in Burma. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  In a strange twist, Razali said Khin Nyunt posited </p><p>that ASSK\'s more threatening stance began after a January </p><p>2003 meeting she had with ex-Charge d\'Affaires to Rangoon </p><p>Priscilla Clapp (Note: Clapp made a personal visit to Rangoon </p><p>in January.  If she met with ASSK, it was with no Embassy </p><p>involvement.  End Note.)  COM asked Razali to clarify if Khin </p><p>Nyunt indicated that the regime believed that Clapp was in </p><p>Rangoon on instructions from Washington or if they understood </p><p>that she was on a personal visit.  Razali said this was not </p><p>clear from what Khin Nyunt said but the regime clearly linked </p><p>the change in ASSK\'s strategy to the Clapp visit.  (Comment: </p><p>This is in all likelihood a red herring thrown out by Khin </p><p>Nyunt in order to build on the theme that ASSK is a pawn of </p><p>foreign governments.  We do not know, however, how much the </p><p>regime may believe its own propaganda.  End Comment.)  Khin </p><p>Nyunt said that the regime had evidence that the NLD had </p><p>recently been working with other political parties to "bring </p><p>things to a boil" before Razali\'s visit and that there was a </p><p>plan to proclaim democracy on June 17, ASSK\'s birthday and to </p><p>demand a transfer of power by September. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  Razali said he was dumbfounded by the logic behind </p><p>Khin Nyunt\'s presentation.  "What do they expect, the people </p><p>love her, of course they are going to turn out."  And he was </p><p>very concerned with the regime\'s response to this perceived </p><p>threat; "If they think the crowds that came out to see her </p><p>were bad, wait until they see what will happen if they </p><p>continue to hold her."  He deemed it totally illogical to </p><p>respond to this perceived threat with a harsh crackdown. </p><p>Razali said he did not want to take on the substance of Khin </p><p>Nyunt\'s presentation at that point and, instead, he told Khin </p><p>Nyunt there would be time to hash through all of these issues </p><p>later but the immediate priority was to get access to ASSK. </p><p>Khin Nyunt responded by showing Razali two photographs dated </p><p>May 31 showing ASSK sitting on a four-poster bed in nice </p><p>surroundings with a few females, possibly her assistants. </p><p>Razali said ASSK looked fine, "not a scratch," in the photos, </p><p>but he told Khin Nyunt that this was no substitute for </p><p>meeting with her.  At this point, Khin Nyunt told Razali, "I </p><p>can\'t do it, it\'s not my decision, it is a group decision." </p><p>Razali implored Khin Nyunt to take the issue to the others </p><p>necessary to make the decision and make the case, reiterating </p><p>that it was of utmost importance. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  Khin Nyunt finally responded by asking if Razali </p><p>would meet with Vice Senior General Maung Aye on Monday, June </p><p>9 in the morning to make the case for access to ASSK directly </p><p>to him.  Razali told COM that this would be the first </p><p>substantive meeting he would have ever had with Maung Aye. </p><p>Razali speculated whether Khin Nyunt needed Maung Aye\'s </p><p>support in order to take the issue to Senior General Than </p><p>Shwe or if perhaps Maung Aye is behind the recent hard-liner </p><p>retrenchment and crackdown.  Razali said Maung Aye has gone </p><p>to lengths to avoid any substantive discussion with him, so </p><p>Razali looks forward to hopefully gaining an insight into the </p><p>decision making process of the junta\'s top three, in addition </p><p>to obtaining access to ASSK.  He said he was not very </p><p>confident that they would allow him access to her but there </p><p>was at least a small chance.  At any rate, he felt that he </p><p>would probably know after the Maung Aye meeting whether or </p><p>not he would gain access to ASSK.  If not, he said he would </p><p>probably leave on the noon flight to Kuala Lumpur. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C)  Discussing the intense press interest in his visit, </p><p>Razali said he would just say at this point "he continues to </p><p>work hard to obtain access to ASSK."  After discussing </p><p>various scenarios for a departure statement with the COM, he </p><p>felt it probably best to provide a short statement in Rangoon </p><p>before departing for KL where he will provide a full briefing </p><p>to the international press. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C)  Comment:  The SE is well aware that the SPDC is </p><p>probably trying to wear out his patience hoping he will leave </p><p>so they can claim that the SE "gave up."  Razali is </p><p>determined, however, to go the last mile and see Maung Aye on </p><p>June 9.  At this point though the SE did not seem hopeful of </p><p>getting access to ASSK.  This is particularly worrisome as we </p><p>and others in the diplomatic community are receiving more </p><p>frequent reports that ASSK may have received serious injuries </p><p>in the May 30 attack.  End Comment. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
