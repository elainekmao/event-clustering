<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ROME 004959 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/10/2007 </p><p>TAGS: PREF, PREL, VM, CB, IT, UN </p><p>SUBJECT: ITALY ON VIETNAMESE MONTAGNARDS:  GIVE GVN PROMISE </p><p>A CHANCE </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. SECSTATE 194170 </p><p>     B. ROME 1162 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: POLMINCOUNS T. COUNTRYMAN FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  04959  131338Z </p><p>1.    (C) ON OCTOBER 10 AT THE MFA, POLOFF MET WITH TIZIANA </p><p>MARINI, DEPUTY OFFICE DIRECTOR FOR SOUTHEAST ASIAN AFFAIRS, </p><p>TO DELIVER REF A DEMARCHE ON PROTECTING VIETNAMESE </p><p>MONTAGNARDS.   AS HER PREDECESSOR RESPONDED TO THE PREVIOUS </p><p>DEMARCHE ON THIS ISSUE (REF B), MARINI SAID THAT THE GOI WAS </p><p>ACTING WITHIN EU POLICY.  SHE ADDED, HOWEVER, THAT THE GOI </p><p>WAS CLOSELY MONITORING THE SITUATION AND WELL AWARE OF THE </p><p>NEED TO MAINTAIN PRESSURE ON THE GVN AND RGC. </p><p> </p><p>2.    (C) MARINI SHARED DETAILS ON BOTH THE EU\'S APPROACH AND </p><p>ITALY\'S POINT OF VIEW.  IN APRIL, THE EU DEMARCHED THE RGC ON </p><p>THE NEED TO ABIDE BY THE GENEVA CONVENTIONS AND COOPERATE </p><p>WITH UNHCR.  IN ADDITION, IT HAD DEMARCHED THE GVN ON THE </p><p>NEED TO IMPROVE THE ECONOMIC AND HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION OF </p><p>CENTRAL HIGHLANDERS.  SHE NOTED THAT THE VIETNAMESE </p><p>CONSTITUTION GUARANTEES FREEDOM OF RELIGION AS LONG AS </p><p>RELIGIOUS BELIEFS DO NOT INTERFERE WITH THE POLITICAL SYSTEM. </p><p> THE GVN REGARDS SOME PROTESTANT SECTS AMONG THE MONTAGNARDS </p><p>AS BEING COMMITTED TO THE OVERTHROW OF THE ESTABLISHED </p><p>POLITICAL ORDER. </p><p> </p><p>3.    (C) IN MAY, AN EU DELEGATION VISITED VIETNAM AND THE </p><p>CENTRAL HIGHLANDS, WHERE IT MET WITH PROVINCIAL AUTHORITIES. </p><p>WHILE THE EU HAS PROVIDED AID TO THAT AREA, IT IS STILL QUITE </p><p>UNDERDEVELOPED.  THE GVN MADE A COMMITMENT TO THE DELEGATION </p><p>TO PRIORITIZE DEVELOPMENT OF RURAL AREAS WHERE ETHNIC </p><p>MINORITIES LIKE THE MONTAGNARDS LIVE.  GVN OFFICIALS CONSIDER </p><p>THOSE WHO HAVE FLED THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS FOR CAMBODIA TO BE </p><p>ECONOMIC MIGRANTS, NOT REFUGEES.  WHILE NOT TAKING A POSITION </p><p>ON THE REASON FOR THE OUTFLOW OF VIETNAMESE MONTAGNARDS, </p><p>MARINI STATED THAT THE GOI TOOK THE GVN DEVELOPMENT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  04959  131338Z </p><p>COMMITMENT AT FACE VALUE AND WAS WAITING TO SEE HOW IT WOULD </p><p>PLAY OUT.  MEANWHILE, THE GOI HAS SIGNED WITH THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL FUND FOR AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT (IFAD) AN </p><p>AGREEMENT FOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS IN VIETNAM. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME04959 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
