REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: THE SITUATION ON COMMERCIAL FARMS </p><p>REMAINS TENSE, WITH NEW OCCUPATIONS AND FEW EVICTIONS OF </p><p>LONG-STANDING SQUATTERS BEING CARRIED OUT.  THE ACTIONS </p><p>OF THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE (GOZ) AND THE ZIMBABWE </p><p>REPUBLIC POLICE (ZRP) CONTINUE TO BE INCONSISTENT AND </p><p>INCOHERENT.  COMMERCIAL FARMERS HAVE MANAGED TO PLANT </p><p>SOME CROPS, ALBEIT FEWER HECTARES.  FARM WORKERS ARE </p><p>GETTING INCREASINGLY ANGRY AS THE CONTINUATION OF THE </p><p>STATUS QUO THREATENS THEIR LIVELIHOODS.  HOME AFFAIRS </p><p>MINISTER NKOMO MET WITH THE CFU IN KAROI DISTRICT ON </p><p>OCTOBER 11 AND STATED THAT FARM INVADERS SHOULD NOT </p><p>INTERFERE WITH THE COMMERCIAL FARMERS\' PLANTING OF </p><p>CROPS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) ECONOFF MET ON OCTOBER 12 WITH OFFICIALS OF THE </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARMERS UNION (CFU) TO DISCUSS THE CURRENT </p><p>SITUATION ON COMMERCIAL FARMS. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>ONGOING AND NEW OCCUPATIONS </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) ACCORDING TO THE CFU THERE ARE CURRENTLY BETWEEN </p><p>900 AND 1000 OCCUPIED FARMS.  THIS IS DOWN FROM A HIGH </p><p>OF AROUND 1700 FARMS INVADED DURING THE RUN-UP TO </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS LAST JUNE.  TWO TO THREE NEW </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  05838  01 OF 02  131204Z </p><p>FARMS HAVE BEEN OCCUPIED EVERY WEEK, BUT THESE </p><p>OCCUPATIONS DO NOT ALL BECOME PERMANENT.  SOMETIMES THE </p><p>OCCUPIERS LEAVE THE FARMS AFTER ONLY A FEW DAYS. </p><p>ACCORDING TO THE CFU, 10-15 PERCENT OF THE OCCUPIERS ARE </p><p>WAR VETERANS, AND THE REMAINDER ARE POOR, LANDLESS </p><p>ZIMBABWEANS FROM THE COMMUNAL AREAS THAT ARE CLOSE TO </p><p>THE OCCUPIED FARMS. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>MIXED SIGNALS FROM THE GOZ AND ZRP </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) GOZ OFFICIALS AND THE ZRP CONTINUE TO SEND MIXED </p><p>SIGNALS REGARDING THE FARM INVASIONS AND THE RULE OF </p><p>LAW.  IN SOME PROVINCES, GOZ OFFICIALS, FROM GOVERNORS </p><p>ON DOWN, HAVE STATED THAT NO MORE FARM OCCUPATIONS WILL </p><p>BE TOLERATED, AND THE ZRP ARE ACTING TO PREVENT NEW </p><p>OCCUPATIONS, AS WELL AS ASSOCIATED CRIMINAL ACTS.  IN </p><p>OTHER PROVINCES, THE OPPPOSITE IS OCCURRING.  AN EXAMPLE </p><p>IS MASHONALAND CENTRAL, WHERE THE DISTRICT ADMINISTRATOR </p><p>HAS TOLD OWNERS OF FARMS LISTED FOR SEIZURE NOT TO </p><p>PLANT.  THE CFU CONTINUES TO RECEIVE NUMEROUS REPORTS </p><p>FROM FARMERS THAT COMPLAINTS TO THE LOCAL POLICE </p><p>CONSTABLES ABOUT CRIMINALITY ASSOCIATED WITH THE FARM </p><p>OCCUPATIONS ARE OFTEN MET WITH ACKNOWLEDGEMENT THAT WHAT </p><p>IS OCCURRING IS ILLEGAL, BUT THAT IT IS A POLITICAL </p><p>ISSUE AND THEIR HANDS ARE TIED. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>MOST FARMERS HAVE PLANTED SOME CROPS </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  05838  01 OF 02  131204Z </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) ACCORDING TO THE CFU, ALMOST ALL THEIR MEMBERS </p><p>HAVE MANAGED TO PLANT SOME CROPS.  WHILE THE MAJORITY OF </p><p>FARMERS CONTINUE TO BE DENIED NEW FINANCING BY BANKS </p><p>BECAUSE OF THE UNSETTLED SITUATION, THEY HAVE MANAGED TO </p><p>SCRAPE TOGETHER THE RESOURCES TO PLANT SMALLER CROPS. </p><p>MANY TOBACCO FARMERS FOR INSTANCE, ARE PLANTING FEWER </p><p>HECTARES.  BECAUSE THEY ARE ALSO PLANTING LATE, THEY </p><p>WILL BE PUTTING IN ONLY ONE TOBACCO CROP INSTEAD OF THE </p><p>NORMAL TWO.  THE CFU ESTIMATES THAT 50 PERCENT FEWER </p><p>HECTARES OF MAIZE WILL BE PLANTED, PRINCIPALLY BECAUSE </p><p>THIS IS A CROP WITH A HIGH RATE OF THEFT, AND FARMERS </p><p>FEAR THAT THEIR CROPS WILL BE STOLEN AT HARVEST TIME. </p><p>WHILE MOST FARMERS HAVE MANAGED TO FIND THE MONEY TO </p><p>PLANT, THE CFU FEARS THAT BY JANUARY MANY WILL RUN OUT </p><p>OF MONEY FOR INPUTS NEEDED TO TEND AND HARVEST THEIR </p><p>CROPS, UNLESS THE BANKS ARE PERSUADED TO LOAN TO THEM. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>TENSIONS ARE RISING AMONG FARM WORKERS </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C)  ACCORDING TO THE CFU, THE MAJORITY OF </p><p>ALTERCATIONS ON FARMS HAVE BEEN SPARKED BY INCREASING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ7655 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  05838  02 OF 02  131204Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   AMAD-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00   VC-00    FRB-00 </p><p>      H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    L-00     VCE-00   AC-01 </p><p>      NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00 </p><p>      ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    STR-00   USIE-00  R-00     PMB-00 </p><p>      DSCC-00  PRM-01   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /009W </p><p>                  ------------------914467  131204Z /38 </p><p>P 131204Z OCT 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 7364 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>DEPT OF TREASURY WASHDC </p><p>USDOC WASHDC </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 005838 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p>USDOC FOR DHENKE-ROGERS </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p>PASS USAID FOR AFR/SD - DWELLER, AFR/SA - CPALMA, </p><p>NNEWMAN, AA/AFR - VDERRYCK, AND A/AID - RMCCALL </p><p> </p><p>USTR FOR ROSA WHITAKER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL 09/20/10 </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  05838  02 OF 02  131204Z </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PGOV, EAGR, PREL, EAID, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: TENSIONS ON COMMERCIAL FARMS CONTINUE </p><p> </p><p>ANGER AND FRUSTRATION AMONG FARM WORKERS, WHO ARE FED UP </p><p>WITH THE ABUSE BEING VISITED ON THEM BY WAR VETERANS. </p><p>SINCE THE GOZ IS LARGELY DOING NOTHING TO PROTECT THEM, </p><p>THEY ARE TAKING ACTION IN SELF-DEFENSE TO PROTECT THEIR </p><p>OWN LIVELIHOODS.  THE CFU BELIEVES THAT MORE VIOLENCE IS </p><p>INEVITABLE AS THE CROP SEASON CONTINUES. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p>THE CFU AND HOME AFFAIRS MINISTER NKOMO MEET IN KAROI </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) IN ONE PROMISING DEVELOPMENT HOME AFFAIRS </p><p>MINISTER NKOMO AND POLICE COMMISSIONER CHIHURI MET ON </p><p>OCTOBER 11 IN KAROI, ONE OF THE AREAS WORST-HIT BY LAND </p><p>RELATED VIOLENCE, WITH CFU EXECUTIVES, LOCAL FARMERS, </p><p>LOCAL BUSINESS PEOPLE, AND WAR VETERANS WHO HAVE BEEN </p><p>OCCUPYING NEARBY COMMERCIAL FARMS.  NKOMO TOLD THE </p><p>GATHERING THAT THE FARMERS SHOULD GO AHEAD WITH THEIR </p><p>PLANTING AND THAT THE FARM OCCUPIERS SHOULD NOT </p><p>INTERFERE.  HE ALSO SAID THAT THE OCCUPIERS SHOULD STAY </p><p>PUT WHERE THEY ARE, AND THAT THEY WILL BE RESETTLED ON </p><p>LAND AS IT BECOMES AVAILABLE.  COMMISSIONER CHIHURI TOLD </p><p>THE ASSEMBLED GROUP THAT THE FARMERS, FARM WORKERS, AND </p><p>WAR VETERANS SHOULD AVOID CONFRONTATIONS, AND THAT THE </p><p>ZRP WOULD ARREST PEOPLE WHO INTERFERE WITH FARMING </p><p>ACTIVITIES OR COMMIT OTHER CRIMES ON THE LAND ON WHICH </p><p>THEY ARE SQUATTING.  THE CFU BELIEVED THIS WAS A </p><p>PRODUCTIVE MEETING THAT MIGHT RESULT IN SOME REDUCTION </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  05838  02 OF 02  131204Z </p><p>IN LAWLESSNESS IN THE AREA, WHICH HAS BEEN EXACERBATED </p><p>BY THE DISTRICT POLICE CHIEF, A FORMER WAR VETERAN WHO </p><p>OPENLY SYMPATHIZES WITH THE LAND OCCUPIERS. </p><p> </p><p>8. COMMENT: IT IS CLEAR THAT THE SITUATION ON COMMERCIAL </p><p>FARMS HAS ONLY MARGINALLY IMPROVED.  ALTHOUGH THE GOZ </p><p>HAS STATED THAT NO MORE FARM INVASIONS WILL BE ALLOWED, </p><p>NEW OCCUPATIONS CONTINUE TO OCCUR.  THE RESPONSE BY </p><p>POLICE TO CRIMINAL ACTS OCCURRING ON OCCUPIED FARMS </p><p>VARIES WIDELY BY DISTRICT AND PROVINCE.  MOST FARMERS </p><p>ARE PLANTING, BUT DOING SO UNDER THE MENACING EYES OF </p><p>WAR VETERANS ON THEIR LANDS, AND ARE CONCERNED THAT THEY </p><p>MAY NOT GET THE FINANCING TO HARVEST THE CROP THEY ARE </p><p>PUTTING IN THE GROUND.  THE CFU MEETING WITH MINISTER </p><p>NKOMO IN KAROI WOULD APPEAR TO BE A PROMISING SIGN, BUT, </p><p>AS ALWAYS, WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS ON THE GROUND WILL </p><p>MATTER MUCH MORE THAN GOVERNMENT PROMISES.  THERE ARE NO </p><p>INDICATIONS THAT THE GOZ IS LOOKING FOR A WAY TO COME TO </p><p>AN AGREEMENT WITH THE CFU ON A LAND REFORM PROGRAM THAT </p><p>BOTH PARTIES COULD ACCEPT AND WOULD RESTORE THE RULE OF </p><p>LAW.  AGRICULTURE MINISTER MADE, FOR EXAMPLE, REFUSES TO </p><p>MEET WITH THE CFU.  WE WILL CONTINUE TO SEE INCREASING </p><p>TENSIONS AND UNCERTAINTY SO LONG AS THE GOZ REFUSES TO </p><p>DEVELOP A FAIR, TRANSPARENT LAND REFORM PROGRAM AND </p><p>CONTINUES TO USE THE LAND ISSUE PRIMARILY AS A POLITICAL </p><p>TOOL.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
