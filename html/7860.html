Sezer said Ankara expected some </p><p>positive steps forward from the Greek Cypriots, and that the </p><p>new openings on both sides of the island inspired hope. </p><p>Bush also assured Sezer that the U.S. was acting in line </p><p>with Turkey\'s sensitivities in Iraq, papers underline. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Earthquake/corruption: The prosecutor in Bingol has issued a </p><p>search and arrest warrant for the corrupt contractors of </p><p>buildings wrecked in the recent earthquake.  Dailies claim </p><p>that the AKP government was planning to take advantage of </p><p>the disaster to make swift changes to the public procurement </p><p>law.  Government officials want housing and energy tenders </p><p>to be excluded from the new law, so that houses for </p><p>earthquake victims can be completed before winter.  Papers </p><p>suspect that the AKP government had been considering changes </p><p>to the public procurement law so that it can give its </p><p>supporters a larger share from lucrative state contracts </p><p>without the transparency required by the new law. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Iraq jobs for Turks: Papers say that the hawks in the </p><p>Pentagon were putting pressure on American companies to </p><p>refrain from cooperating with Turkish subcontractors in </p><p>Iraq\'s reconstruction.  Turkish companies, particularly </p><p>giants like Koc and Sabanci groups are alarmed by this </p><p>negative course of developments in Washington.  The </p><p>Washington Administration will force Turkish businessmen to </p><p>form partnerships with Northern Iraqi Kurdish companies if </p><p>they want to win contracts `easily,\' "Star" claims. The </p><p>paper goes on to say that both the PUK and KDP leadership </p><p>have given Ankara the message that Turkish companies could </p><p>bypass the negative attitude of Americans against Turks only </p><p>through partnership with Kurdish firms.  "Star" comments </p><p>that Washington, striving to decrease tension between Ankara </p><p>and the Northern Iraqi Kurdish groups, might be using the </p><p>Iraqi contracts as a trump card. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>TGS uneasy about speculation: The TGS (Turkish General </p><p>Staff) issued Monday a strongly worded statement to `show </p><p>the military\'s decisiveness in facing enemies of republic </p><p>who attempt to undermine unity.\'   The statement said that </p><p>the military was the foremost guarantor of Turkey\'s secular </p><p>democratic regime.  The statement also harshly criticized </p><p>foreign and domestic press reports alleging disagreement </p><p>among military commanders. The TGS message was aimed at </p><p>press reports claiming a duel of words between the </p><p>government and military wings of the NSC during meetings. It </p><p>declared these reports to be untrue,.  Mainstream papers see </p><p>the statement as the strongest message issued by the TGS </p><p>under Gen. Ozkok\'s command. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION: US foreign policy in post Saddam Iraq </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Pax-Americana in the Middle East" </p><p>Sami Kohen wrote in mass appeal Milliyet (5/6): "In the </p><p>aftermath of the Iraq war, we have been observing the steps </p><p>taken by the US in the Middle East as its new strategy. </p><p>Washington has started implementing an American order, the </p><p>Pax Americana if you will,  in the Middle East and beyond. . </p><p>These are the current steps that are being taken:  The </p><p>restructuring of Iraq is underway in its all dimensions, and </p><p>it is happening in the way the US desires. . The US is </p><p>revising its current alliances with old friends, but also </p><p>has started establishing new alliances in the region, such </p><p>as with Kuwait, Qatar and Bahrain. . Syria is the new target </p><p>for the US, which was pronounced as part of axis of evil. </p><p>Yet it seems things are moving to a direction where </p><p>Washington sees no point for a military operation at least </p><p>for the moment as proven with the SecState Powell visit. . </p><p>The Bush administration has also started dealing with the </p><p>Palestine issue, which happens to be the major source of </p><p>tension in the Middle East. . All of this indicates that </p><p>President Bush\'s doctrine or the Pax Americana in a broader </p><p>sense, is now coming true." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
