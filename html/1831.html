(C) RULING PARTY CANDIDATE AND MASHONALAND CENTRAL </p><p>GOVERNOR ELLIOT MANYIKA SOUNDLY DEFEATED OPPOSITION </p><p>CANDIDATE ELLIOT PFEBVE IN THE PARLIAMENTARY BY-ELECTION </p><p>HELD JULY 28-29 IN BINDURA DISTRICT.  THE RULING ZANU-PF </p><p>WIDENED ITS MARGIN OF VICTORY CONSIDERABLY OVER LAST </p><p>JUNE\'S PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION, IN WHICH THE MDC LOST BY </p><p>JUST OVER 2,000 VOTES.  MANYIKA POLLED 15,864 VOTES </p><p>AGAINST 9,456 FOR PFEBVE, AN INCREASE OF 4,300 VOTES IN </p><p>THE RULING ZANU-PF\'S MARGIN OF VICTORY OVER LAST YEAR. </p><p>THE BY-ELECTION WAS HELD TO REPLACE YOUTH DEVELOPMENT </p><p>MINISTER AND ZANU-PF COMMISSAR BORDER GEZI, WHO DIED IN </p><p>AN APRIL CAR ACCIDENT.  THE TURNOUT OF 25,849 REGISTERED </p><p>VOTERS WAS VIRTUALLY THE SAME AS LAST JUNE.  THE </p><p>DOMESTIC MONITORING ORGANIZATION ZIMBABWE ELECTION </p><p>SUPPORT NETWORK (ZESN) TOLD US THAT 56,651 VOTERS WERE </p><p>REGISTERED IN THE DISTRICT FOR THE ELECTION, A 6.5 </p><p>PERCENT INCREASE OVER THE 53,191 REGISTERED LAST JUNE. </p><p>RINDAI CHIPFUNDE, COORDINATOR OF ZESN, SAID THE SIZE OF </p><p>THE INCREASE IN REGISTERED VOTERS RAISED EYEBROWS.  SHE </p><p>SPECULATED THAT MOST OF THE NEWLY-REGISTERED VOTERS WERE </p><p>RECENTLY-RESETTLED PEASANT FARMERS, MOST OF WHOM SUPPORT </p><p>ZANU-PF.  (COMMENT: THE INCREASE COULD ALSO BE </p><p>ATTRIBUTED TO REGISTRATION CAMPAIGNS BY BOTH ZANU-PF AND </p><p>MDC, BUT NOT TO DEMOGRAPHIC PATTERNS OR ECONOMIC GROWTH </p><p>IN THE REGION.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02311  01 OF 02  011401Z </p><p>2.  (C) THE POLLING DAYS WERE MARRED BY A NUMBER OF </p><p>VIOLENT INCIDENTS.  THE INDEPENDENT "DAILY NEWS" </p><p>REPORTED THAT ON 28 JULY, 21 MDC SUPPORTERS WERE </p><p>ABDUCTED BY ZANU-PF SUPPORTERS, AN MDC VEHICLE WAS </p><p>STONED, AND FOUR OTHER SUPPORTERS WERE BEATEN AND </p><p>HOSPITALIZED.  THE PRESS REPORTED THAT ON 29 JULY, </p><p>POLICE DETAINED MDC CANDIDATE PFEBVE AND 25 OTHERS FOR </p><p>ALLEGEDLY GETTING TOO CLOSE TO A POLLING STATION.  MDC </p><p>PRESIDENT MORGAN TSVANGIRAI TOLD US JULY 31 THAT ZANU-PF </p><p>BUSED LARGE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE INTO BINDURA CONSTITUENCY, </p><p>ESTABLISHED BASES THAT WERE USED BY WAR VETERANS AND </p><p>PARTY THUGS TO BEAT AND INTIMIDATE VOTERS, AND POSTED </p><p>200 ZANU-PF YOUTHS OUTSIDE EVERY POLLING CENTER, A </p><p>PRESENCE THAT WAS INEVITABLY INTIMIDATING TO VOTERS.  HE </p><p>ADDED THAT IN LIGHT OF THESE EFFORTS, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN </p><p>NAIVE TO EXPECT THE ELECTION TO GO ANY OTHER WAY.  THE </p><p>MDC HAD EXPECTED TO RECEIVE ABOUT 40 PERCENT OF THE </p><p>VOTES (ITS CANDIDATE RECEIVED 36 PERCENT), AND </p><p>TSVANGIRAI SAID THE MDC WOULD NOT CONTEST THE RESULT. </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>MDC ELECTIONS DIRECTOR PAUL THEMBA NYATHI TOLD US </p><p>EARLIER THAT AN OPPOSITION WIN IN BINDURA COULD HAVE </p><p>SPARKED A MORE HARSH AND WIDESPREAD CRACKDOWN ON THE </p><p>MDC, OR HAVE CONVINCED ZANU-PF NOT TO HOLD MORE </p><p>ELECTIONS AS THEY COULD NOT WIN THEM.  THE SEVERAL </p><p>MONTHS PRECEDING THE ELECTION WERE BADLY MARRED BY </p><p>POLITICAL VIOLENCE AND INTIMIDATION, MAINLY AT THE </p><p>EXPENSE OF MDC SUPPORTERS (REF B).  HUNDREDS OF ZANU-PF </p><p>SUPPORTERS ATTACKED TSVANGIRAI\'S MOTORCADE ON 22 JULY AS </p><p>HE TRIED TO CAMPAIGN FOR PFEBVE (REF A). </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) COMMENT:  THE BINDURA VOTE, THE FIRST </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02311  01 OF 02  011401Z </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY BY-ELECTION IN NEARLY SEVEN MONTHS, WAS A </p><p>CRUCIAL TEST FOR ZIMBABWE\'S TWO MAIN PARTIES.  THE </p><p>RESULT DEMONSTRATED THAT THERE ARE STILL A LARGE NUMBER </p><p>OF RURAL RESIDENTS WILLING TO VOTE FOR ZANU-PF; A HEAVY </p><p>INVESTMENT IN PATRONAGE AND GOVERNMENT HANDOUTS BY </p><p>BINDURA\'S FORMER MP, BORDER GEZI, CERTAINLY HELPED </p><p>MAINTAIN SUPPORT AMONG THE RULING PARTY\'S CORE CADRE IN </p><p>THE DISTRICT.  DIRTY TRICKS, SUCH AS REGISTERING NON- </p><p>RESIDENT VOTERS AND TURNING AWAY SUSPECTED MDC </p><p>SUPPORTERS FROM THE POLLING BOOTH, PROBABLY PLAYED A </p><p>ROLE AS WELL.  WE SUSPECT THAT VIOLENCE AND INTIMIDATION </p><p>WERE ALSO SIGNIFICANT FACTORS.  MORE THAN HALF OF ALL </p><p>REGISTERED VOTERS STAYED HOME, AND THE NUMBER OF MDC </p><p>VOTES FELL BY 16 PERCENT FROM LAST YEAR.  ZANU-PF\'S </p><p>ABILITY TO CONCENTRATE ITS INTIMIDATION MACHINERY ON A </p><p>SINGLE DISTRICT ACCOUNTS FOR MUCH OF THE SWING IN VOTES </p><p>FROM LAST YEAR.  THE MDC LIKELY WILL NOT CONSIDER THE </p><p>BINDURA RESULT A SIGNIFICANT BLOW TO ITS PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>PROSPECTS, GIVEN THAT MASHONALAND HAS LONG BEEN A ZANU- </p><p>PF STRONGHOLD.  MDC SECRETARY-GENERAL WELSHMAN NCUBE </p><p>TOLD US RECENTLY THAT THE OPPOSITION PARTY NEEDS TO </p><p>GARNER 40 PERCENT OF THE VOTES IN MASHONALAND TO WIN THE </p><p>PRESIDENCY. </p><p> </p><p>4.
