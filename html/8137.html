The DART conducted an assessment on 10 May of the newly </p><p>established Palestinian refugee camp in the Baladi Yat area </p><p>of Baghdad.  Although the camp appeared to be well managed </p><p>by the Palestinian Red Crescent and is supported by the </p><p>surrounding community, an inadequate water and sanitation </p><p>system combined with warming temperatures will increase the </p><p>likelihood of health hazards and communicable diseases. The </p><p>camp director warned that the population may swell to </p><p>approximately 1,000 families over the next two weeks, </p><p>thereby creating emergency requirements for shelter, food, </p><p>and water and sanitation.  Despite being assured that </p><p>security was not a concern at the camp, the DART was forced </p><p>to depart hastily from the area when gunfire erupted near </p><p>the DART vehicles.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>CHANGE OF ATMOSPHERE </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  Upon arriving at the refugee camp, the DART met with the </p><p>camp\'s director and other community leaders to discuss the </p><p>circumstances leading to the creation of the camp and the </p><p>possible needs of the residents.  The camp leaders were very </p><p>forthcoming with information regarding needs of the </p><p>residents, support from relief agencies to date, and access </p><p>to the camp.  Once the camp leaders had answered DART </p><p>enquiries regarding humanitarian issues, however, the DART </p><p>received a lecture on the history of how approximately </p><p>35,000 Palestinians found refuge in Iraq following the </p><p>events of 1948 and how much the Palestinians in Baghdad </p><p>loved Saddam Hussein for all the support and subsidies he </p><p>provided during his regime.  When asked about a permanent </p><p>solution to their situation, the camp leaders responded that </p><p>there was no option other than a return to Palestine. </p><p> </p><p>3.  The camp director then asked for contact information </p><p>from DART officers for possible future needs discussions. </p><p>Upon receiving DART business cards, there was a palpable </p><p>change of atmosphere, and it became apparent that there had </p><p>been a mistranslation of whom the DART represented.  When </p><p>the camp director realized the DART was part of the USG, he </p><p>immediately developed a more stolid attitude and commented </p><p>that he expected more from the USG "since you are </p><p>responsible for half of our burden."  The meeting adjourned </p><p>quickly and DART officers were allowed to inspect the camp. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>SUPPORT FROM FORMER REGIME </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  The Baladi Yat area is reportedly home to approximately </p><p>8,000 Palestinian refugees who had been receiving financial </p><p>and material support from a variety of international </p><p>agencies including the International Committee of the Red </p><p>Cross (ICRC), the United Nations High Commissioner for </p><p>Refugees (UNHCR), and the Iraqi Red Crescent.  However, </p><p>since the collapse of the former regime and the consequent </p><p>cessation of government subsidies, many of these residents </p><p>were unable to afford rents set by the owners and were </p><p>evicted from their apartments.  Approximately 400 families </p><p>since early April have been forced to leave their homes and </p><p>relocate mostly in the local soccer club grounds (the site </p><p>visited by the DART) and other locations in the area.  The </p><p>DART counted approximately 120 tents at the location and was </p><p>informed that the average family size was five to six </p><p>persons.  The camp leaders were most concerned that the </p><p>population of the camp could increase suddenly over the next </p><p>two weeks since approximately 700 other families face </p><p>eviction. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>CAMP MANAGEMENT </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  Camp residents are residing on the soccer pitch in new </p><p>tents provided by the Iraqi Red Crescent Society, although </p><p>the tents are designed for only four persons.  The camp </p><p>appears to be well managed and maintained, and there were no </p><p>visible signs of overcrowding.  However, there is no more </p><p>space inside the fenced soccer pitch, and if the population </p><p>should rise dramatically, as anticipated by the camp </p><p>leaders, more tents will have to be erected in the empty </p><p>field adjacent to the soccer pitch.  There is currently a </p><p>need for more tents, and the Iraqi Red Crescent Society told </p><p>the camp directors that it could not provide a fence if the </p><p>camp were expanded.  The increasingly high temperatures in </p><p>Baghdad will exacerbate both health and safety concerns. </p><p>There is no separate cooking facility, and residents use gas </p><p>bottles in their tents. </p><p> </p><p>6.  Food stocks have been provided by several international </p><p>agencies including the ICRC and Iraqi Red Crescent Society, </p><p>although at the time of the DART assessment, there were </p><p>reserves available for only the next two weeks, presuming </p><p>that the camp population does not increase.  The most </p><p>pressing need, according to the camp directors, is safe </p><p>drinking water.  The Government of Qatar recently provided </p><p>bottled water, but stocks were expected to last only a few </p><p>days.  The camp was trying to arrange for regular water </p><p>deliveries by truck, as the quality of water provided by the </p><p>local system was unknown. </p><p> </p><p>7.  The DART\'s water and sanitation specialist noted that </p><p>although he detected chlorine in the local water sources, </p><p>the water was not suitable for consumption.  (There were </p><p>only three taps running from the same source.)  This same </p><p>area was also used for washing and laundry.  In addition, </p><p>the five toilets available (open-pit latrines) were </p><p>inadequate for the size of the camp.  The women\'s bathroom </p><p>was well lighted and separated from the men\'s facilities. </p><p> </p><p>------ </p><p>HEALTH </p><p>------ </p><p> </p><p>8.  There is a large outpatient clinic in the immediate </p><p>vicinity that supports the camp with a variety of health </p><p>services.  The clinic was established originally to tend </p><p>exclusively to the Palestinians, but now serves the entire </p><p>community.  It employs a staff of over 150 and operates 24 </p><p>hours per day.  The clinic has always been managed by the </p><p>Palestinian Red Crescent, and depends on various donations </p><p>to renew its medical stocks.  The clinic staff visit the </p><p>camp every day and have noticed no health status </p><p>deterioration to date. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>SECURITY </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  The camp directors claimed that there were no problems </p><p>with camp security, and that other than a few isolated </p><p>incidents of violence, the relations between the </p><p>Palestinians and local Iraqi populace were excellent.   Most </p><p>of the recent evictions reportedly were financially </p><p>motivated and had little or nothing to do with ethnic or </p><p>human rights issues. </p><p> </p><p>10.  Despite earlier claims by camp leaders of no security </p><p>problems in the camp, the DART assessment was curtailed </p><p>after approximately 30 minutes due to an outbreak of gunfire </p><p>near the DART vehicles, after which the DART immediately </p><p>departed the camp.  (Comment:  DART officers believe the </p><p>gunfire was a deliberate intimidation tactic to compel the </p><p>DART to leave the camp.  None of the camp leaders escorted </p><p>the DART or participated in the camp assessment following </p><p>the initial meeting.  The DART believes it was allowed a </p><p>cursory evaluation of the camp and then encouraged to depart </p><p>through the automatic rifle fire.  End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
