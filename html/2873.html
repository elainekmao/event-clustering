<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 001405 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR INL AND AF </p><p>. </p><p>NSC FOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>. </p><p>JUSTICE FOR OIA, OPDAT AND ICITAP </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/05/2017 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, SNAR, CJAN, KCRM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEETING WITH NIGERIA\'S NEW ATTORNEY GENERAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA 729 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter for reasons 1.5 (b) </p><p>and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>This is an action cable; action request for INL in para 14. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.(C) Summary:  Nigeria\'s Attorney General, Godwin Kanu </p><p>Agabi, appears comfortable  in his second go-round as the </p><p>country\'s top law enforcement official. During an April -- </p><p>initial meeting with  Ambassador Jeter, Agabi responded </p><p>positively on all facets on our bilateral law enforcement </p><p>relationship and pledged to build on the progress made by his </p><p>predecessor in strengthening U.S.-Nigerian law enforcement </p><p>cooperation.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.(C) Ambassador Jeter, accompanied by POLCOUNS and RNLEO, </p><p>made an introductory call on Attorney General Godwin Kanu </p><p>Agabi at the Ministry of Justice. Agabi was renamed AG by </p><p>President Obasanjo on March 6, succeeding the late Chief Bola </p><p>Ige, who was assassinated last December.  Agabi was AG from </p><p>June 1999 to June 2000 when he was transferred to the </p><p>Ministry of Solid Minerals. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.(C)  Agabi expressed deep appreciation for U.S. support for </p><p>Nigeria\'s democratic transition, noting that "you stood with </p><p>us" during the dark days of military rule.  He also thanked </p><p>the U.S. for its assistance on numerous fronts, from judicial </p><p>reform to counter-narcotics, though he called for additional </p><p>assistance to help overcome the atrophy of Nigeria\'s </p><p>democratic institutions, caused by years of military misrule </p><p>and neglect.  The Ambassador noted the looming challenge of </p><p>conducting free, fair and peaceful elections and the Attorney </p><p>General concurred that the Justice Ministry and security </p><p>services have their work cut out for them.  "There\'s little </p><p>respect for law" in Nigeria\'s charged political environment, </p><p>he noted. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.(C) The Ambassador reviewed the diverse range of USG </p><p>assistance efforts in Nigeria, spanning military assistance </p><p>and training, education, health, judicial reform, police </p><p>modernization, counter-narcotics, anti-corruption, and </p><p>fighting trafficking in persons.  He highlighted the fact </p><p>that this is a dramatic increase in assistance to Nigeria and </p><p>noted that, on the law enforcement front, only three years </p><p>ago we had no significant cooperation with the GON. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.(C) The AG acknowledged the US commitment to Nigeria and </p><p>asked the USG and the broader international community to be </p><p>patient as the current regime struggles to cope with myriad </p><p>law enforcement and judicial problems.  "Nigeria\'s experience </p><p>in emerging from the military years is like a country coming </p><p>out of a war," Agabi explained.  He admitted that corruption </p><p>is a major obstacle to reform, and he also decried the poor </p><p>performance of the National Assembly in passing crucial law </p><p>enforcement legislation.  The AG quipped that "moving </p><p>legislation through the Assembly was like rolling a ball of </p><p>meat through a pack of wolves." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Bilateral Agreement and LE Committee </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.(C) Recounting the successful first meeting of the </p><p>U.S.-Nigeria Law Enforcement Committee meeting in Washington </p><p>DC last November, the Ambassador highlighted the joint </p><p>declaration signed at the conclusion of those bilateral </p><p>discussions by INL A/S Beers and the late Attorney General </p><p>Chief Bola Ige.  Presenting the new AG with a copy of the </p><p>declaration (which Agabi had been given earlier), the </p><p>Ambassador noted that several of the five GON action items to </p><p>be accomplished before the next meeting of the LE Committee </p><p>have not been addressed.  Agabi expressed his desire to hold </p><p>the next LE Committee meeting as originally scheduled, in May </p><p>2002 in Abuja.  In response, the Ambassador suggested a </p><p>postponement to allow Agabi and his staff time to achieve </p><p>greater progress on the action items of the last meeting\'s </p><p>declaration.  The AG reiterated his desire for the May </p><p>schedule, noting that "I work best under pressure." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.(C) The USG will soon be prepared to sign a bilateral </p><p>Letter of Agreement (LOA) governing $3.5 million in FY01 law </p><p>enforcement assistance, the Ambassador announced.  This </p><p>assistance would cover several key areas such as Police </p><p>Reform, aid to the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency </p><p>(NDLEA) and aid to the police to fight trafficking in </p><p>persons.  A copy of the draft LOA was left with the Minister </p><p>for review, with the caveat that this was still a draft </p><p>subject to change. (Note: two weeks later, Post formally </p><p>transmitted an INL-cleared version of the LOA to the AG for </p><p>his consideration. End Note) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.(C) The Ambassador began reviewing developments and </p><p>outstanding requests in the various areas of bilateral law </p><p>enforcement.  He recounted the provision of almost $500,000 </p><p>in counter-narcotics assistance to the NDLEA in 2001 and </p><p>expressed the hope that the Federal government would, in the </p><p>coming budget cycle, give this sole drug control agency the </p><p>resources necessary for effective drug enforcement. Noting </p><p>that the NDLEA falls under his domain as the Justice </p><p>Minister, Agabi responded confidently that the NDLEA\'s budget </p><p>would be improved. </p><p>419 Fraud Workshop </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.(C) Drawing attention to the continued high-visibility </p><p>threat of advance-fee, or "419" fraud committed by Nigerian </p><p>criminals against U.S. citizens, the Ambassador recalled Bola </p><p>Ige\'s request that the U.S. Secret Service office in Lagos </p><p>sponsor an in-country workshop on 419 fraud to exchange </p><p>information and bring relevant Nigerian law enforcement </p><p>personnel up-to-date on changing techniques of perpetrating </p><p>this form of criminal activity.  The Ambassador stated that </p><p>the USSS stands ready to organize this workshop at the AG\'s </p><p>direction.  Agabi responded enthusiastically and suggested </p><p>this be scheduled within the next two months. </p><p>Financial Crimes and Money Laundering </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.(C) The Ambassador reviewed the recent history of the </p><p>FATF\'s declaration of Nigeria as a "Non-Cooperation Country </p><p>or Territory (NCCT)" and the GON\'s delayed response to FATF </p><p>concerns over Nigeria\'s inadequate money laundering controls. </p><p> Agabi responded by noting that his office had drafted the </p><p>Financial Crimes Commission Act, which was presented to the </p><p>National Assembly in January and awaits enactment. Similarly, </p><p>the MOJ is drafting revisions to Nigeria\'s Money Laundering </p><p>law in line with the FATF\'s recommendations.  The AG </p><p>expressed optimism that the new Financial Crimes Commission </p><p>would improve enforcement efforts against money laundering </p><p>and financial crimes.  He called, however, for U.S. </p><p>assistance to the new Commission, noting that the Federal </p><p>government would not likely provide it with adequate </p><p>resources. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Extradition Requests and Workshop </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.(SBU) On the subject of extradition requests, Agabi </p><p>immediately conceded that the Nigerian judiciary is infected </p><p>with corruption and  this is the main reason USG requests for </p><p>extradition have failed in the past.  Special, efficient </p><p>extradition courts are need, he declared.  In response to the </p><p>Ambassador\'s request for an efficient and lawful mechanism to </p><p>handle our extradition requests, Agabi stated that he would </p><p>soon ask President Obasanjo for approval to establish special </p><p>courts for extradition requests and financial crime cases. </p><p>When briefed by the Ambassador on the long-standing proposal </p><p>to have an extradition seminar or exchange in Abuja with MOJ </p><p>prosecutors and judges, the AG stated that he welcomes such </p><p>an exchange that would help his staff of prosecutors.  On a </p><p>specific inquiry from RNLEO concerning a renewed USG </p><p>extradition request for Gabriel Umoh, the AG responded that </p><p>earlier that week he had signed the necessary papers to begin </p><p>the court case against Umoh. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Immigration Crimes and INS Visits </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.(C) During discussions with USINS officials on November 9 </p><p>in Washington, Bola Ige had agreed to host the visit of INS </p><p>officials to discuss modalities of Joint Prisoner </p><p>Repatriation Flights (JPATS), the Ambassador recalled. </p><p>Emphasizing the USG\'s desire to work with the GON to improve </p><p>coordination on the transfer of prisoners, he asked the </p><p>Attorney General if he was willing to host the visit of INS </p><p>officials, which had been postponed by the tragic murder of </p><p>Bola Ige.  Agabi agreed to a rescheduled visit. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13.(C)  Agabi has taken over the reigns of the Justice </p><p>Ministry and apparently wants to continue the cooperative </p><p>legacy of the late Bola Ige.  He appears accessible, engaging </p><p>and in good command of the various issues in his brief.  He </p><p>has responded to Embassy inquiries in person and made the </p><p>unusual offer to the Ambassador that he would come to the </p><p>Embassy for their next meeting. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14.(SBU) Action Request for INL:  Please provide a response </p><p>to the Attorney General\'s request that the Bilateral LE </p><p>Committee meeting be held in May in Abuja.  If INL proposes a </p><p>postponement until July or August -- with which we would </p><p>concur fully -- we will encourage the AG to produce concrete </p><p>progress on the action items of the November 9 Joint </p><p>Declaration. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
