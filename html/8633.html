<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L HARARE 001180 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR J. FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR C. GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR C. NEARY </p><p>BANGKOK FOR WIN DAYTON </p><p>DS/OP/AF </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/10/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: HIGH COURT TO HEAR TSVANGIRAI BAIL APPLICATION; </p><p>BISHOPS CONTINUE TO PRESS FOR DIALOGUE </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: POLITICAL OFFICER PEGGY BLACKFORD FOR REASONS 1.5B/D </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>TSVANGIRAI REMAINS IN CUSTODY:  NCUBE EXPECTED TO BE RELEASED </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>TODAY </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU)  Morgan Tsvangirai, MDC President, arrived in </p><p>Magistrates Court this morning looking tired and dressed in a </p><p>track suit rather than his usual business attire.  A large </p><p>contingent of his supporters were on hand outside the court </p><p>to cheer him on but they were outnumbered by Law and Order </p><p>Police who jammed the court room.  At the hearing the </p><p>Magistrate placed Tsvangirai on remand until July 10. </p><p>(Remand is similar to arraignment and means that the judge </p><p>has found the State has sufficient evidence to hold the </p><p>suspect.)  Normally the Magistrate would have entertained a </p><p>bail hearing at the same time; however, Magistrate\'s Court </p><p>does not have the authority to set bail on treason charges. </p><p>Instead Tsvangirai\'s attorney planned to ask for bail this </p><p>afternoon before the High Court which decided to hear the </p><p>case in camera.  According to the attorney, the </p><p>Attorney-General requested a delay in the hearing which has </p><p>been rescheduled to tomorrow morning, June 11. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)   Welshman Ncube, Secretary-General of the MDC, who </p><p>was also detained on new treason charges yesterday was being </p><p>held in Harare Central Prison. His attorney reported that he </p><p>believed Ncube would be released today. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BISHOPS BRIEF MDC ON DISCUSSIONS WITH ZANU-PF LEADERS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  Special Advisor to MDC President Tsvangirai, Gandi </p><p>Mudzingwa, told PolOff that the MDC leadership had been </p><p>briefed by the local bishops on their progress in getting </p><p>ZANU-PF to the negotiating table.  According to the bishops, </p><p>high ranking ZANU-PF leaders including Nathan Shamuyarira and </p><p>John Nkomo have assured them that ZANU is committed to </p><p>dialogue and is looking to find a way forward rather than to </p><p>review old grievances.  MDC leaders reminded the bishops that </p><p>MDC President, at their last briefing, had emphasized the </p><p>need for President Mugabe to make a public commitment to </p><p>dialogue.  Mudzingwa remains skeptical that such a commitment </p><p>will be forth coming in the near future. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  Today\'s "Daily News" editorial asks, "Could crackdown </p><p>herald peace talks?" and reviews Mugabe\'s history of </p><p>negotiating only after doing everything possible to weaken </p><p>his opponent as he did in the eighties when he co-opted </p><p>Joshua Nkomo and his ZAPU party into the ZANU ranks.  This </p><p>may,indeed, be Mugabe\'s strategy.  Even Mugabe must recognize </p><p>that while he may have won last week\'s battle, it will only </p><p>gain him a little time unless the serious issues facing the </p><p>economy are resolved.  It would explain why rumors of ZANU-PF </p><p>overtures to the MDC are rife at the same time the GOZ is </p><p>doing all within its power to undercut the MDC leadership in </p><p>public. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
