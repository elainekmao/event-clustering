<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 RANGOON 000639 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p>CDR USPACOM FOR FPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/01/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINS, PREL, BM, ASSK, NLD </p><p>SUBJECT: NLD SHUT DOWN; AUNG SAN SUU KYI WHEREABOUTS STILL </p><p>UNKNOWN </p><p> </p><p>REF: RANGOON 636 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: COM Carmen Martinez.  Reason: 1.5 (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary:  The NLD has been effectively shut down in </p><p>Burma.  Its offices have been closed and its senior leaders </p><p>are under detention.  Aung San Suu Kyi has been brought back </p><p>to Rangoon, ostensibly for "her own protection,"  but it is </p><p>not clear yet where she is being held.  Universities, which </p><p>were scheduled to re-open today for the new semester, have </p><p>been kept closed by the government.  Reportedly, a curfew has </p><p>been imposed in Mon Ywa in Sagaing Division in northwest </p><p>Burma, but the situation is quiet in Rangoon, with no signs </p><p>of additional security beyond a few additional MI </p><p>surveillance teams.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Aung San Suu Kyi </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Aung San Suu Kyi has been brought back to Rangoon, but </p><p>it is not clear where she is being held.  Speculation </p><p>suggests that she may be either at Insein Prison, where </p><p>special quarters were built for her during the late 1990s, or </p><p>at the police camp in Htaukyant where NLD Vice Chairman U Tin </p><p>Oo was held during his latest detention in 2000.  No </p><p>diplomats or international press have seen ASSK since she was </p><p>detained "for her own protection" on May 30.  We have been </p><p>able to confirm that NLD Chairman U Aung Shwe and NLD </p><p>spokesman U Lwin are under detention in their homes.  U </p><p>Lwin\'s daughter told us today that U Lwin saw the Chief of </p><p>Mission, the British Charge\' and the Italian and German </p><p>Ambassador\'s, when they attempted to visit him on June 1, and </p><p>appreciated the visit </p><p> </p><p>NLD Offices </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) All NLD state and township offices have been closed </p><p>and sealed throughout Burma.  According to NLD party workers, </p><p>none have been left open.  However, no NLD party workers </p><p>beyond ASSK, the central committee members and those picked </p><p>up in Depeyin have been detained. </p><p> </p><p>NLD Version of Events in Depeyin </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Some NLD party workers have suggested that the riot in </p><p>Depeyin was the result of a pre-planned government ambush. </p><p>Supposedly, the NLD had received notice days before the riot </p><p>that the government planned to stage an attack in Depeyin </p><p>using convicts released from Mandalay Prison.  Reportedly, </p><p>the tactics used by the rioters matched the reports received </p><p>by the NLD. </p><p> </p><p>Universities and Secondary Schools </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) Most universities were advised last night that the </p><p>next school semester will start June 16, rather than June 2. </p><p>Today, only the medical colleges were open and operating. </p><p>Secondary schools have also been closed for the month of </p><p>June, though the government has attributed that closure, </p><p>which was announced in late May, to a fear of SARS, rather </p><p>than the recent political events. </p><p> </p><p>Curfews and Marshal law </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) Rangoon is quiet.  While military intelligence has put </p><p>some additional surveillance teams on the street, presumably </p><p>to check the public mood, there is no sign of increased </p><p>security.  In the north, a curfew has reportedly been imposed </p><p>in Mon Ywa, though we have not been able to confirm this as </p><p>yet. </p><p> </p><p>Diplomatic Pressure </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) We sent a follow-up note to the Ministry of Foreign </p><p>Affairs today asking for meetings with the Ministers of </p><p>Foreign Affairs, Home Affairs and Information to discuss the </p><p>incidents in the north and ASSK\'s detention. (Copies of these </p><p>notes have been faxed to EAP/BCLTV.)  As yet, the Ministry </p><p>has not responded to our requests.  The Japanese Ambassador </p><p>told us that his government had called in the Burmese DCM in </p><p>Tokyo; similarly, the British called in the Burmese </p><p>Ambassador in London. </p><p>8. (C) The Japanese Ambassador has asked for meetings with </p><p>Secretary 1, the Foreign Minister and the Home Minister, thus </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>far without success.  The Home Minister, in fact, cancelled </p><p>out of a dinner which the Japanese Ambassador had scheduled </p><p>for June 1.  The Japanese Ambassador indicated that he </p><p>intends to deliver a demarche which makes clear that the </p><p>Japanese government "cannot tolerate" the detention of Aung </p><p>San Suu Kyi and the closure of the NLD offices. </p><p> </p><p>Press Coverage </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) The official press has gone quiet on the clashes </p><p>between NLD and regime supporters.  After two days of stories </p><p>regarding the riot in Depeyin, there was nothing in Monday\'s </p><p>official Burmese press.  However, the Ministry of Foreign </p><p>Affairs announced late today that it will hold a briefing for </p><p>diplomats tomorrow. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) The bottom line right now is that the NLD has been </p><p>shut down.  Its offices have been closed and its senior </p><p>leadership, including Aung San Suu Kyi, is under detention. </p><p>The only question is how severe and how extended this new </p><p>bout of repression will be.  So far, all the signs suggest </p><p>that democratic forces in Burma may be in for long, hard </p><p>period ahead.  End Summary. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
