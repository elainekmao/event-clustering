(U) SUMMARY:  On February 18, the sixth and final U.S. </p><p>Department of Labor (USDOL) funded project, the National </p><p>Program for the Prevention and Elimination of Child Labor, </p><p>officially commenced.  This project focuses on the </p><p>prevention and elimination of child labor by strengthening </p><p>the capacity of government, mass organizations and civil </p><p>society to address the problems of the worst forms of child </p><p>labor through the prevention, protection and removal from </p><p>dangerous work of children who are at the greatest risk.  As </p><p>Vietnam\'s economy transforms, there has been both a dramatic </p><p>fall in the numbers of children participating in economic </p><p>activities and the growth of new forms of vulnerabilities. </p><p>Prior to this project Vietnam had already begun to address </p><p>the issue through such actions as the ratification of ILO </p><p>Convention 182.  However, this program presents an </p><p>opportunity to bring together the various stakeholders in a </p><p>more cohesive and comprehensive approach.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) Continuing implementation of the 2000 U.S.-Vietnam </p><p>Memorandum of Understanding on Labor (MOU) and its </p><p>accompanying technical assistance programs (see reftel), the </p><p>U.S. Department of Labor (USDOL) funded National Program for </p><p>the Prevention and Elimination of Child Labor was officially </p><p>launched on February 18.  This 30-month, $500,000 program </p><p>focuses on the prevention and elimination of child labor by </p><p>strengthening the capacity of government, mass organizations </p><p>and civil society to address the problems of the worst forms </p><p>of child labor through the prevention, protection and </p><p>removal from dangerous work of children who are at the </p><p>greatest risk.  It is being executed by the International </p><p>Labor Organization (ILO) Program on the Elimination of Child </p><p>Labor (IPEC) in collaboration with Vietnam\'s Ministry of </p><p>Labor, Invalids and Social Affairs (MOLISA), the Ministry of </p><p>Education and Training, provincial governments, Vietnam </p><p>General Confederation of Labor (VGCL), the Vietnam Chamber </p><p>of Commerce and Industry (VCCI), and the Vietnam Cooperative </p><p>Alliance (VCA).  These bodies will cooperate to carry out </p><p>research, raise awareness, review national laws, and promote </p><p>the creation of community-based monitoring of child labor. </p><p>In addition to working to progressively eliminate child </p><p>labor in selected hazardous sectors by removing a total of </p><p>approximately 1500 children from work, the program will </p><p>provide these children with social protection services. </p><p>Furthermore, recognizing that the issue of the child labor </p><p>cannot be resolved without creating alternative sources of </p><p>income, the program will enable family members of former </p><p>working children to access income generation and training </p><p>activities. </p><p>3.  (U) At the official launch ceremony, speakers from </p><p>MOLISA, the ILO, the provinces and Embassy highlighted </p><p>Vietnam\'s continuing efforts in this area, including the </p><p>ratification of ILO Convention 182 on the Prohibition and </p><p>Immediate Action on the Worst Forms of Child Labor and the </p><p>creation of a Draft National Plan of Action on Child Labor. </p><p>They pointed out that as Vietnam\'s economy transforms, there </p><p>has been, in general terms, a dramatic fall in the numbers </p><p>of children participating in economic activities.  However, </p><p>reports indicate a rise in internal migration and the </p><p>numbers of displaced and unregistered families and children </p><p>found in urban centers.  Children and young people can now </p><p>be found in informal work arrangements that are unsupervised </p><p>and unregulated.  U.S. DCM emphasized that we are especially </p><p>concerned about children, who work long hours, sometimes </p><p>away from home, under exploitative, socially unjust or </p><p>hazardous conditions, with little or no pay, and who are </p><p>deprived of their right to health, education and future </p><p>development. </p><p>4.  (SBU) COMMENT AND RECOMMENDATION:  The GVN, having </p><p>approved the project in March 2002, has been anxiously </p><p>awaiting its launch while the ILO worked through its own </p><p>internal process.  A number of issues still need to be </p><p>addressed between USDOL and the National Project Manager. </p><p>Post therefore, recommends that the USDOL International </p><p>Program Analyst come to Vietnam as soon as possible for in- </p><p>country consultations. </p><p>5.  (SBU) COMMENT CONT\'D:  With this program underway, all </p><p>six projects outlined in the bilateral MOU have begun.  As </p><p>we approach this year\'s bilateral labor dialogue, the future </p><p>of this excellent cooperation program should be discussed. </p><p>While the approval process was neither quick nor easy, the </p><p>GVN is enthusiastically implementing all six projects with </p><p>excellent results. The MOU has provided an important tool to </p><p>advancing labor issues in Vietnam.  Post recommends </p><p>consideration of additional programs that could fall under </p><p>the MOU. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p></p></div>
