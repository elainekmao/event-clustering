The primary topic was the role </p><p>of the GOZ in acquiring and distributing the staple </p><p>food, maize, in the coming months.  So far the GOZ </p><p>claims to have imported about 686,000 MT of maize.  For </p><p>the next hunger season (May 2003 - April 2004) the GOZ </p><p>expects a harvest of about 571,000 MT and to import </p><p>another 230,000 MT for a total stock of about 802,000 MT </p><p>verses a demand of nearly 1.9 million MT.  The GOZ </p><p>expects the resulting deficit of about 1.1 million MT to </p><p>be covered by a winter crop, additional GOZ imports, and </p><p>donor contributions.  The GOZ also expressed a </p><p>willingness to consider wheat monetization.  Both the </p><p>GOZ and WFP discussed constraints to importing </p><p>additional food. </p><p> </p><p>In addition, the GOZ discussed the current livestock </p><p>situation ("critical") and an up-coming nationwide </p><p>health/nutritional survey sponsored by the GOZ, WHO and </p><p>UNICEF.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>1.  On 27 January 2003, US Ambassador Sullivan and </p><p>Acting USAID Director attended a periodic meeting </p><p>organized by the UN for diplomats to discus issues </p><p>related to the humanitarian crisis with cabinet level </p><p>representatives of the GOZ.  While most embassies were </p><p>represented by ambassadors/high commissioners, only the </p><p>Minister of Health (MoH), the Minister of Small </p><p>Enterprise Development (MoSME), the Deputy Minister for </p><p>Education, the Director of Veterinary and Livestock </p><p>Services at the Ministry of Agriculture (MoA), and an </p><p>Office Director from the Ministry of Public Service, </p><p>Labor, and Social Welfare (MoPSLSW) (Mr. Mitzi) were </p><p>present for the GOZ. The UN Humanitarian Coordinator </p><p>(UNHC) opened the meeting with a review of the visit and </p><p>discussions of UN Special Envoy for the humanitarian </p><p>crisis, James Morris. (See REFTEL) </p><p> </p><p>2.  The EU Ambassador opened the discussion from the </p><p>floor by suggesting that it is now necessary to "fast- </p><p>track" a food monetization program for Zimbabwe.  The </p><p>Minister of Health responded that the GOZ would welcome </p><p>a written proposal.  The Ambassador also repeated an </p><p>earlier request for a written explanation of the role of </p><p>the Grain Marketing Board (GMB) in providing food during </p><p>the current crisis.  Mr. Mitzi stated that such a </p><p>document is being prepared.  The SME Minister also noted </p><p>the need for transparency of the GMB. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Mr. Mitzi then provided information on food imports </p><p>by the GOZ as follows: </p><p> </p><p>-Total maize imported February through mid-December </p><p>2002:  685,784 MT (the EU requested figures for the last </p><p>6 weeks as well). </p><p>-GOZ estimate of 2002/3 maize harvest:  571,347 MT, of </p><p>which 56,335 MT will be turned over to GMB (Comment: we </p><p>presume that the rest will be grown at subsistence level </p><p>on communal farms and therefore not enter the market). </p><p>-In addition to the harvest, GOZ expects GMB to have </p><p>230,965 MT on hand (Comment: this is actually planned </p><p>imports). </p><p>-Therefore, GOZ expects to have a total national maize </p><p>stock for the period July 2003-June 2004 of 802,312 MT </p><p>against a total consumption need (human and livestock) </p><p>of 1,895,843 MT.  This means a GOZ planned deficit of </p><p>1,093,531 MT for 2003/4 which is to be met from "winter </p><p>cropping, government imports, and humanitarian aid." </p><p> </p><p>4.  WFP noted that it will cost approximately US$300 </p><p>million to meet a 1,000,000 MT deficit. </p><p> </p><p>5.  The MoPSLSW recognizes the following constraints in </p><p>meeting the country\'s maize requirements: </p><p> </p><p>-foreign currency shortage; </p><p>-the regional drought is causing congestion in the </p><p>supply routes; </p><p>-congestion at the Beitbridge border post; </p><p>-a critical shortage of locomotives; </p><p>-insufficient forex to bid on land transport vehicles </p><p>(regionally);  and </p><p>-shortage of smaller trucks for the GMB to deliver food </p><p>within the country. </p><p> </p><p>Donors also asked for similar information on other </p><p>commodities (e.g., wheat, beans, etc.). </p><p> </p><p>6.  WFP made the following comments about its program: </p><p> </p><p>-WFP is bringing in 2,500-3,000 MT per day; </p><p>-import permit problems are improving; </p><p>-WFP is developing a contingency stock of fuel; </p><p>-the WFP pipeline will dry up sometime between March and </p><p>April 2003;  and </p><p>-availability of South African rail cars is becoming a </p><p>serious constraint. </p><p> </p><p>7.  A representative from the MOH briefed the group on </p><p>the up-coming UNICEF/WHO/GOZ nutrition survey of </p><p>children under 60 months.  This survey is to follow up </p><p>on an assessment done in May 2002.  It will include all </p><p>districts in both rural and urban areas.  It will look </p><p>at wasting, stunting, underweight, vitamin A, feeding </p><p>patterns of orphans, common childhood illnesses, </p><p>mortality, and supplemental feeding.  Training is going </p><p>on now, and field work is expected to be completed late </p><p>February with a first draft planned for early March. </p><p> </p><p>8.  The MOA representative reported on the livestock </p><p>situation as follows: </p><p> </p><p>-The current drought is having a major impact - over </p><p>20,000 animals have been reported to have died between </p><p>October 2002 and January 2003 in Matabeleland Province </p><p>alone (the actual number is probably much higher). </p><p>-Stock feed supply is critical, which is also severely </p><p>impacting on the dairy, pig, and poultry industries. </p><p>-Foot-and-Mouth disease is getting worse.  Note:  He </p><p>blamed this on the regional nature of the crisis - the </p><p>crisis in Botswana could have been prevented if Botswana </p><p>had bought vaccines for Zimbabwe back in October 2002 </p><p>when the problem began - and on the lack of forex to buy </p><p>vaccines. </p><p>-While the number of dairy farms has decreased by 20-25% </p><p>(due to the resettlement program) the national dairy </p><p>heard has remained about the same size as cows are </p><p>transferred between farms, but milk production has </p><p>decreased (current demand is 13 million liters while </p><p>production is only 7-8 million liters per month). </p><p> </p><p>Comment:  The meeting produced some good information </p><p>from the government, for a change; but still not enough. </p><p>Despite improvements in current WFP operations, the GOZ </p><p>projections paint a fairly bleak picture regarding </p><p>future humanitarian assistance prospects in Zimbabwe, </p><p>indicating that the magnitude of the crisis is not </p><p>likely to abate soon, and that continued substantial </p><p>humanitarian assistance - similar to or more than last </p><p>year\'s levels -- will likely be required over the coming </p><p>year.
