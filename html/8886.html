<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 001091 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF/W, INR AND EB </p><p>STATE PASS USTR </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/20/2013 </p><p>TAGS: EPET, ENRG, ELAB, PINS, PGOV, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: FUEL PRICE INCREASE MAY TRIGGER VIOLENCE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter; Reasons 1.5 (B) and </p><p>(D) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: On June 20, the GON announced a 65 percent </p><p>fuel price hike, increasing consumer prices from 26 naira to </p><p>40 naira per liter.  Most Nigerians expected a rise in costs, </p><p>but did not expect the announcement to come so quickly nor </p><p>probably did not expect its magnitude.  The move however is a </p><p>dual victory for deregulation of the downstream sector and </p><p>for easing the GON\'s fiscal position.  However, many </p><p>Nigerians will be unhappy due to the expected rise in </p><p>transportation and some food prices.  Nigeria Labour Congress </p><p>(NLC) leadership told Econoff that they had not yet decided </p><p>how to respond.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) On June 20, the GON announced the immediate increase </p><p>in the official price of gasoline from 26 naira a liter </p><p>($0.75 a gallon) to 40 ($1.25 a gallon), diesel from 26 naira </p><p>to 38 and kerosene from 24 naira to 38. The decision, though </p><p>expected by most Nigerians and in the offing for months, will </p><p>be unpopular.  One of the reasons why it was announced on </p><p>Friday was so that negative passions might cool over the </p><p>weekend.  Nigeria\'s urban poor, who rely on private </p><p>transportation, will see an immediate increase in prices. </p><p>The prices of many commodities will climb. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NLC Left in the Dark </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>3. (C) Senior Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) </p><p>official Austen Oniwon told Econoff on June 20 the GON did </p><p>not consult with labor after making the decision to raise </p><p>prices. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) An Embassy source said he spoke with NLC President </p><p>Adams Oshiomole in Geneva last week. Oshiomole confirmed the </p><p>NLC was discussing the fuel price hikes with the GON and </p><p>would probably accept an increase of 5 to 7 naira. Oshiomole </p><p>was still in Switzerland, the source stated. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) On June 16, Econoff met with the NLC\'s Senior </p><p>Assistant General Secretary Olaitan Oyerinde.  He opposed the </p><p>proposed hikes but was resigned to a slight increase. </p><p>Oyerinde asserted the GON\'s argument that a price increase </p><p>would cut smuggling, encourage investment in oil refineries, </p><p>and reduce government expenditures was erroneous.  He </p><p>complained that Obasanjo had used the NNPC to bilk billions </p><p>of naira from the country, and was lifting the "so-called" </p><p>fuel subsidy to allow his cronies to profit even more. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) NLC\'s Salihu Lukman, Senior Assistant General </p><p>Secretary, Education and Training, confirmed that the NLC was </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>resigned to an increase but warned that a steep increase </p><p>could spark a spontaneous public reaction.  If the increase </p><p>were too much, Lukman was fearful that some workers, </p><p>especially food market workers, would riot in protest of </p><p>rising costs. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) COMMENT: The GON announced the fuel price on a </p><p>Friday, hoping that tempers will cool over the weekend.  The </p><p>GON assured the public that the estimated $2 billion dollars </p><p>that will be saved on the fuel subsidy will be channeled to </p><p>health care, schools and roads.  However, many Nigerians are </p><p>skeptical.  Cheap fuel prices have been a benefit all </p><p>Nigerians have come to expect from the country\'s petroleum </p><p>industry.  Now, that benefit is evaporating and many people </p><p>will not like it.  Obasanjo\'s political opposition will </p><p>likely also try to capitalize on this.  However, a price hike </p><p>was inevitable.  The downstream sector needs the incentive </p><p>that any price liberalization can give.  Moreover, the GON\'s </p><p>loss of revenue (primarily due to reduced oil production </p><p>caused by unrest around Warri) made the increase even more </p><p>imperative.  Lastly, Obasanjo learned a lesson from the 100 </p><p>days of his first Administration.  In Nigeria, it is easier </p><p>to enact unpopular reforms at the beginning of an </p><p>Administration than later when the electorate is less </p><p>forgiving. Consideration needs to dominate. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) COMMENT CONTINUED: Right now, we do not know how the </p><p>NLC will respond.  There does not seem to be much eagerness </p><p>for a strike among members of the leadership with whom we </p><p>have talked.  Yet, reaction among the general membership </p><p>could be strong.  If the NLC strikes, this would be the first </p><p>major challenge of the new Administration.  If it does not </p><p>strike, Obasanjo will achieve a major victory.  Without the </p><p>NLC taking the lead, chances of massive national protest </p><p>become remote, although localized disturbances remain </p><p>possible.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
