<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 003894 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/14/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, ETTC, EPET, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDAN\'S IRAQ JITTERS </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) AMMAN JO 3705 (B) AMMAN 1782 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edward Gnehm.  Reasons 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p> ------ </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (S) Repeated public statements by Jordanian FM Muasher and </p><p>PM Abul Ragheb since July 10 denying that Jordan will be used </p><p>as a "launching pad" for U.S. military operations against </p><p>Iraq shed light on GOJ sensitivity to its vulnerabilities </p><p>vis-a-vis Baghdad.  Similarly, on July 13, the GOJ issued a </p><p>clear statement distancing itself from former Crown Prince </p><p>Hassan\'s participation at a gathering of Iraqi Oppositionists </p><p>in London this past weekend.  There may also have been a </p><p>political angle to the Jordanians\' reluctance to put a stop </p><p>to oil smuggling through the Port of Aqaba, at least to the </p><p>extent that it was politically easier to begin than to end </p><p>the smuggling.  With concern about the stalled MEPP as a </p><p>backdrop, the GOJ appears to be recalibrating its familiar </p><p>policy of placating the Iraqis and demonstrating to the </p><p>Jordanian street a degree of independence from domestically </p><p>unpopular U.S. policies.  To calm the immediate uproar, we </p><p>recommend that the Department find an appropriate opportunity </p><p>to say that we have not asked Jordan to take part in any new </p><p>cooperative military activities beyond our routine </p><p>military-to-military relationship.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>Jordan\'s Vulnerabilities </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) As senior GOJ officials from the King down routinely </p><p>stress to visitors, the government is extremely nervous about </p><p>the potential domestic repercussions of any visible U.S. </p><p>preparations for a military confrontation with Iraq, or of </p><p>perceived Jordanian participation/collaboration in such </p><p>preparations.  The reasons for this concern are familiar: </p><p> </p><p>     Oil: Through its oil/barter arrangements, Jordan obtains </p><p>all of its oil from Iraq at below world market prices.  A cut </p><p>off of Iraqi oil before, during or after U.S. military action </p><p>could have potentially devastating consequences for Jordan\'s </p><p>economy. </p><p> </p><p>     MEPP: Without much difficulty, the Iraqis could step up </p><p>the drumbeat of radical pronouncements on the MEPP, with </p><p>disruptive consequences for Jordan.  At its most extreme, </p><p>this could turn into a campaign to destabilize Jordan by </p><p>labeling the GOJ a lackey of the U.S. in the "suppression" of </p><p>the Palestinian Intifada -- a hot button issue for most of </p><p>the Jordanian population.  As long as average Jordanians view </p><p>the GOJ as weak on support for the Palestinians, the </p><p>government will see itself as vulnerable to pressure from </p><p>Iraq (and other radical states). </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Periodically, events (or the Iraqis themselves) remind </p><p>the Jordanians that Iraq has the power to do a great deal of </p><p>mischief if it chooses.  The vulnerabilities noted above are </p><p>realities that the GOJ keeps in mind as it seeks to protect </p><p>its national interests in the region\'s political rapids. </p><p>Indirectly, they also help explain the GOJ\'s recent public </p><p>statements and other policy stances. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>Leaks Generate Frequent Jordanian Denials </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Over the past week, senior Jordanian officials have </p><p>gone out of their way to  refute the proposition -- sourced </p><p>by the press to U.S. officials -- that Jordan will be used as </p><p>a U.S. "launching pad" for future military operations against </p><p>Iraq.  In interviews with local, regional, and international </p><p>media (including the NYTimes on July 10), and most recently </p><p>at the conclusion of the Arab League Follow-Up Committee </p><p>meeting in Cairo on July 12, FM Muasher "categorically denied </p><p>any plans between Jordan and the United States in this </p><p>regard."  PM Ali Abul Ragheb, in a July 11 Press Conference </p><p>(given prominent coverage in the local pro-government media), </p><p>echoed and amplified the message: "Jordan does not allow and </p><p>will not allow in the future its territory and airspace to be </p><p>used to interfere in the affairs of any other Arab country, </p><p>particularly fraternal Iraq." </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) Both the FM and PM in their public statements have </p><p>also contended that there are "no U.S. troops on Jordanian </p><p>soil," and the local press reported that FM Muasher told the </p><p>Iraqi Ambassador to Jordan that he could "visit any military </p><p>base at any time to personally verify the veracity of the </p><p>Jordanian statements."  A tour is being arranged for Azraq </p><p>AFB. </p><p> </p><p>6. (S) The Ambassador, in meetings July 10 and 11, told both </p><p>Muasher and Abul Ragheb that their statements denying any </p><p>U.S.troop presence in Jordan were neither factually correct </p><p>(given our long-standing training and exercise program) nor </p><p>sustainable.  Muasher\'s response was that this problem began </p><p>because "someone in the Pentagon had leaked materials on </p><p>preparations for an assault on Iraq.  Look, this puts us in a </p><p>very difficult position.  I\'m being called by the New York </p><p>Times and others on this. We have no choice but to say what </p><p>we are saying." </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>Prince Hassan\'s London Appearance Adds to the Story </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) Taking a similar tack, the GOJ July 13 delivered a </p><p>clear public message that former Crown Prince Hassan\'s </p><p>participation at the London gathering of Iraqi Oppositionists </p><p>was "a personal act  . .  and does not represent official </p><p>policy."  Minister of State for Political Affairs, Mohammed </p><p>Adwan, in a statement carried by the official Petra News </p><p>Agency, and given prominent above-the-fold coverage in the </p><p>July 14 local press, stated "We were surprised at the </p><p>participation, which neither the leadership nor the </p><p>government had any prior knowledge of, and which does not </p><p>conform to the principled Jordanian stand on brotherly Iraq." </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>Humanitarian Flights and Oil Smuggling </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (S) The barrage of public statements by senior GOJ </p><p>officials this past week are not the only evidence of the </p><p>wary "neighborliness" the GOJ seeks to maintain with Iraq. </p><p>This policy often has an overtly economic or commercial </p><p>component.   Royal Jordanian Airlines (RJ) has continued its </p><p>humanitarian flights from Amman to Baghdad at about 4-5 per </p><p>week. This represents a small downward trend in flight </p><p>frequency since the Embassy demarched the GOJ in mid-June </p><p>that RJ\'s Baghdad flights threatened to become a regular </p><p>commercial transaction and needed to be scaled back.  (The </p><p>DCM raised this issue again with the FM\'s office on July 15 </p><p>and pressed for further and faster reductions.) </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Similarly, after almost a month\'s hiatus, there was a </p><p>renewed attempt to smuggle illegal Iraqi oil from the </p><p>Jordanian port of Aqaba (ref a) at the beginning of July. </p><p>While this case appears to have been stopped successfully, it </p><p>suggests the allurements to fudging policy (and the truth) </p><p>that Iraq offers Jordanian officials.  We can only assume </p><p>that some Jordanians, whether officials or private citizens, </p><p>have benefited from the smuggling that has taken place.  The </p><p>scheme inevitably created a political dynamic, however, and </p><p>it was no doubt easier to start the exercise than to stop it. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>Comment and Recommendation </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (S) The actions and statements outlined above bear </p><p>careful watching, but we know from contacts with the King and </p><p>other senior officials that they do not represent any </p><p>fundamental change in Jordanian policy.  They would love to </p><p>see Saddam go, but in the meantime they must live next to </p><p>him.  They are the latest developments in the long-continued </p><p>balancing act that Jordan must carry out to protect its </p><p>interests.  The perceived deadlock in the MEPP (current </p><p>diplomatic activities notwithstanding), the disappointment, </p><p>frustration and anger many Jordanians feel regarding the </p><p>plight of the Palestinians in the face of Israeli </p><p>reoccupation, and the continued economic difficulties Jordan </p><p>faces as a result of the Intifada and the global economic </p><p>slowdown heighten the GOJ\'s perception that on issues </p><p>relating to Iraq, it has to tread very carefully.  We will </p><p>see a similar pattern whenever U.S.-Iraq confrontation </p><p>intensifies. </p><p> </p><p>11. (S) Embassy Recommendation: To deal with the immediate </p><p>irritant on Iraq -- the stories reportedly tying Jordan to </p><p>U.S. military preparations against Saddam Hussein -- we </p><p>recommend that the Department find an opportunity to say that </p><p>we have not approached the Jordanians with requests for </p><p>military cooperation beyond our routine military-to-military </p><p>contacts. </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
