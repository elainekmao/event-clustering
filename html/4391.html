<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L HARARE 002574 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR AF/FO KANSTEINER AND BELLAMY AND AF/S </p><p>NSC FOR SR AFRICA DIR JENDAYII FRAZER </p><p>AID FOR AFRICA A/A NEWMAN </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/19/2007 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, ZI, SF, Zimbabwe South African Relations </p><p>SUBJECT: SOUTH AFRICAN VIEW OF ITS BILATERAL COMMISSION </p><p>MEETING WITH ZIMBABWE </p><p> </p><p>REF: HARARE 2560 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: JGSULLIVAN FOR REASONS 1.5B/D </p><p> </p><p>1.(C) Summary: South African High Commissioner Ndou told the </p><p>Ambassador Nov 19 that the Nov 10-11 Zimbabwean-South African </p><p>Bilateral Commission had focused principally on economic and </p><p>technical issues.  He took some comfort in the Zimbabwean </p><p>Government delegation\'s readiness to acknowledge their </p><p>profound needs and said that SAG would engage on many of </p><p>these without providing serious subsidies or cash. On </p><p>political issues, the GOZ confined itself to asking the SAG </p><p>to help repair its relations with the UK and US, while </p><p>sticking to the hollow argument that it cannot dialogue with </p><p>the MDC so long as the MDC maintains its suit to overturn </p><p>presidential election results.  Apparently, the SAG did not </p><p>push the issue. End Summary </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) SAG HC Ndou, who participated in the Nov 10-11 </p><p>Bilateral Commission meeting told the Ambassador that the </p><p>meeting had focused largely on technical and economic issues, </p><p>discussed at a Ministerial level.  For example, the GOZ </p><p>acknowledged its acute shortage of seeds and other farm </p><p>inputs-- SAG will seek to help through discount offers of </p><p>seeds, but this will be far short of needs. ESKOM will also </p><p>study the Hwange, Zimbabwe power plant with a view of </p><p>improving regional power capacity, but will only be providing </p><p>energy that Zimbabwe can pay for.  Similarly, SASOL will only </p><p>maintain its current agreement with NOCZIM, which provides </p><p>for SASOL to provide fuel only after receiving Zim payment. </p><p> </p><p>3.(C) On food, the SAG committed to help Zimbabwe within the </p><p>limits of the food pledge made to the entire South African </p><p>region for which Malawi and other countries are also </p><p>competing.  Asked whether food for Zimbabwe would go to the </p><p>World Food Program or the GOZ for distribution, Ndou </p><p>suggested that South Africa\'s contribution might be divided </p><p>between the two. The Ambassador suggested that providing food </p><p>directly to the GOZ would be problematic, given GOZ </p><p>politicization of food under its control.  Ndou noted that </p><p>Foreign Minister Mudenge had claimed to FM Zuma that the </p><p>WFP\'s suspension of food deliveries to Insiza were caused by </p><p>an MDC-NGO effort to direct WFP food to its supporters.  Ndou </p><p>said he told Zuma that this was only one version of the truth </p><p>(a euphemistic way to describe a lie, since Mudenge has the </p><p>WFP\'s full documentation of ZANU-PF militants\' seizure of WFP </p><p>under the tolerant eyes of police.) </p><p> </p><p>4.(C) On land, Ndou said that the GOZ had sought to turn the </p><p>discussion from how the land redistribution had been carried </p><p>out to how the "completed" process could be made to work. </p><p>The GOZ claimed that the missing element was UK compensation </p><p>for farmers and international assistance for new farmers -- </p><p>themes FonMin Zuma echoed in her press remarks. Ndou said </p><p>that the SAG had urged a reengagement on the Abuja accord </p><p>commitments with Nigeria again taking a lead. </p><p> </p><p>5.(C) Ndou said there was little engagement on political </p><p>issues, as Mudenge maintained the line that no dialogue with </p><p>the MDC was possible so long as the MDC maintained its court </p><p>challenge of the presidential election.  Instead, the GOZ </p><p>asked South Africa to help the UK and US to improve relations </p><p>with Zimbabwe.  It does not appear that the SAG pushed back </p><p>very hard and Ndou said that the SAG hoped that governance </p><p>issues could be addressed as a consequence of GOZ acceptance </p><p>of NEPAD.  The Ambassador took the occasion to outline his </p><p>recent discussions with GOZ officials on the political crisis </p><p>and to underline that there was no exit from Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>inter-related crises without addressing the political crisis. </p><p> Ndou did not disagree, but it does not appear that the SAG </p><p>took this line at the Pretoria meetings. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Ndou said that the SADC-EU meeting in Maputo had been </p><p>spoiled by Foreign Minister Mudenge who took a rhetorical and </p><p>absolutist position, thereby rejecting the position brokered </p><p>by South Africa and others which would have had the EU and </p><p>SADC continuing to dialogue on Zimbabwe.  Instead, the final </p><p>communique spelled out that the EU and SADC disagreed totally </p><p>on Zimbabwe. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Ndou noted that the number of Zimbabwean applicants </p><p>for visas to South Africa was growing daily, in part due to </p><p>the UK\'s new visa regime. He said that about 40 per cent of </p><p>these visa recipients never returned to Zimbabwe. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
