(U) This is an action cable; see para 5. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Jordan has made some progress in strengthening its </p><p>environmental regulatory structure since signing the Free </p><p>Trade Agreement (FTA) with the U.S. in October 2000. </p><p>Specifically, seven new environmental by-laws, drafted by the </p><p>General Corporation for Environmental Protection (GCEP), have </p><p>been brought into effect.  The seven by-laws currently in </p><p>force relate to: </p><p> </p><p>--the organization and management of GCEP; </p><p>--the protection of coastal zones and marine waters; </p><p>--the control of ozone-depleting substances; </p><p>--the GCEP funding mechanism to combat hazardous and harmful </p><p>waste; </p><p>--noise pollution; </p><p>--financial and administrative oversight for projects funded </p><p>by GCEP; and </p><p>--Environment Protection Fund responsibilities. </p><p> </p><p>Another 13 by-laws remain "in progress," according to our </p><p>contacts at GCEP.  Those by-laws in that pipeline cover such </p><p>issues as solid waste management, air quality, greenhouse </p><p>emissions, pesticide use, and national parks management. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) At the same time, an initial flurry of activity and </p><p>discussion surrounding the creation of a stand-alone </p><p>environment ministry or cabinet-level entity entrusted with </p><p>environmental enforcement has noticeably ebbed.  A new </p><p>environment law, of which a new environment regulatory body </p><p>is a part, continues to rest with the cabinet "under review," </p><p>almost one year from its drafting.  Even the Minister for </p><p>Municipalities, Rural Affairs, and the Environment Tbeishat </p><p>expressed his hope to the NEA Regional Environment Officer on </p><p>May 21 that the law would be passed "soon," although he </p><p>conceded that there is little outward sign of movement. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Jordan has also yet to name its participants in the </p><p>Joint Forum on Environmental Technical Cooperation, </p><p>stipulated by the "Joint Statement on Environmental Technical </p><p>Cooperation" issued when the FTA was signed in October 2000. </p><p>This body should meet prior to the first FTA Joint </p><p>Commission, which should be held within one year of the </p><p>FTA,s entry into force.  The joint statement also calls for </p><p>an assessment of Jordan,s current environmental management </p><p>capacity to be undertaken and its findings presented to the </p><p>first meeting of the Joint Forum.  If the GOJ were to </p><p>formally request assistance, USAID is prepared to fund this </p><p>assessment, using a 2000 FTA-related environmental review it </p><p>conducted on Jordan,s environmental institutional and </p><p>legislative framework as a foundation study. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Action request:  Post is keen to advance our </p><p>bilateral trade agenda and is prepared to assist in </p><p>encouraging the Jordanians to enhance its environmental </p><p>regulatory framework.  We believe that the most effective way </p><p>to jumpstart a process would be for an appropriate Washington </p><p>official (perhaps in USTR) to send a letter to a Jordanian </p><p>counterpart (such as the Minister of Industry and Trade </p><p>and/or the Minister of State for Economic Affairs), noting </p><p>our readiness to follow through on the joint statement </p><p>commitments to form an environmental forum and to conduct an </p><p>environmental management capacity assessment survey.  Such a </p><p>letter could suggest a timetable and would then serve as a </p><p>basis for a potential Jordanian request for USAID assistance </p><p>in conducting the survey.  Alternatively, we would be pleased </p><p>to deliver this or a similar message directly, as instructed </p><p>by Washington. </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
