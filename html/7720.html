OTTAWA 1142 </p><p> </p><p>     B. STATE 101323 </p><p>     C. OTTAWA 960 </p><p>     D. STATE 79970 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Classified by Economics Minister Counselor Michael Galla </p><p>gher.  Reason 1.5 (b and d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U)  Action request paragraph 3. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Canada\'s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade </p><p>conveyed (by fax) the following response to our ref B </p><p>demarche.  The fax cover sheet requested that we advise the </p><p>GOC of how we expect to proceed. </p><p> </p><p>Begin text of GOC response: </p><p> </p><p>--  Thank you for your visit of April 22, 2003 and for </p><p>consulting with us on your anticipated next steps with </p><p>respect to combatting terrorism financing. </p><p> </p><p>--  As you are aware, all of the individuals and entities, </p><p>identified in your April demarche, are known to Canadian </p><p>authorities. In fact, law enforcement investigations are </p><p>ongoing. </p><p> </p><p>--  Canada continues to weigh the merits of designating </p><p>Canadians and entities based in Canada, as terrorist, under </p><p>our legislation, against the effects that such designation </p><p>would have on ongoing criminal investigations. </p><p> </p><p>--  At this time, we believe that a designation of the </p><p>individuals and entities in question, by the United Sates or </p><p>the UNSC 1267 Committee, would be deleterious to the ongoing </p><p>law enforcement actions in Canada. </p><p> </p><p>--  We will continue to share information with you through </p><p>established law enforcement and intelligence channels. </p><p> </p><p>End text. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S)   Embassy contacts explained unofficially that the </p><p>GOC understands from recent conversations with DC </p><p>counterparts that the proposed designation is a </p><p>"housekeeping" measure designed to ensure that groups or </p><p>individuals removed from the G-7 listing process in April, </p><p>2002, do not fall through the cracks.  The GOC is under the </p><p>impression that confirmation that they object to the </p><p>designation due to ongoing investigations is sufficient to </p><p>prevent USG designation of the proposed targets. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S)  Action request:  Please let us know if this is not </p><p>the case.  If Washington intends to proceed with the </p><p>designation, we will so advise the GOC. </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
