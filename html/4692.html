<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 007229 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>USDOC FOR ADVOCACY CENTER - C JAMES </p><p>USDOC FOR 4520/ITA/MAC/ONE/COBERG </p><p>EXIMBANK FOR ROBERT MORIN </p><p>TDA FOR STEINGASS/SIGLER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: BEXP, EFIN, EAIR, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDAN:  YET ANOTHER DELAY FOR BOEING </p><p> </p><p>REF: AMMAN 6022 </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED.  PROTECT SENSITIVE BUSINESS </p><p>INFORMATION. </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  Summary.  Minister of Transportation Nader Dahabi </p><p>informed the Charge that an independent airline consultant </p><p>has been brought in to analyze Boeing/Airbus offers to sell </p><p>short-haul jets to Royal Jordanian Airlines (RJ) (REFTEL). </p><p>The analysis, which will delay yet again a decision by RJ by </p><p>approximately six months, will be done as the government and </p><p>RJ deliberate a proposal that the Social Security Corporation </p><p>(SSC) purchase the jets and lease them back to RJ.  This </p><p>delay is likely to disappoint Boeing as it further extends an </p><p>already long and arduous process.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>YET ANOTHER DELAY </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) During a meeting that covered a range of </p><p>transportation issues (SEPTEL), Minister  Dahabi informed the </p><p>Charge that, as a possible option to upgrade Royal </p><p>Jordanian\'s fleet (REFTEL), the Ministry of Transport (MOT) </p><p>may ask the Social Security Corporation (SSC) to purchase the </p><p>jets and lease them back to RJ.  Dahabi said he is going to </p><p>sit down with the minister of Labor and the CEO of the SSC to </p><p>"look at RJ\'s case".  If it looks like the right idea, the </p><p>SSC will negotiate directly with RJ.  He emphasized that the </p><p>SSC would need to see a viable business plan from RJ to be </p><p>sure the investment makes sense. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Concurrently, Dahabi said, RJ has asked an </p><p>independent airline consultant, SH & E, to examine competing </p><p>offers from Boeing and Airbus to determine which would be </p><p>best for RJ, or whether leasing rather than direct purchase </p><p>might be a more viable option.  He said SH & E, which is </p><p>based in London but has offices in New York and Chicago, </p><p>would come to Jordan after the holidays to begin the </p><p>analysis.  He said using an external consultant would ensure </p><p>that the process was transparent.   Acknowledging that this </p><p>would stretch out the process, Dahabi said that "if we take </p><p>another five to six months, it won\'t hurt us".  He added that </p><p>he had recently informed the French Ambassador about the SSC </p><p>option, but had yet to inform him about the consultants. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Dahabi said, in a meeting RJ CEO Samir Majali had </p><p>with PM Abul Ragheb two months ago, the PM advised Majali and </p><p>the RJ Board that "now was not the right time to buy, because </p><p>we don\'t know what will happen with Iraq".  Dahabi said the </p><p>PM suggested that, given cash flow concerns at RJ, leasing </p><p>might be a better option.  He reiterated the government\'s </p><p>strong position that it would not guarantee any RJ loans, </p><p>consistent with its strategy since 1994, and RJ\'s status as a </p><p>self-sustaining company, even if state-owned. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Dahabi said that the Jordanian Government and RJ\'s </p><p>caution goes back to the Gulf War.  He said RJ made a deal in </p><p>1987 to purchase 14 Airbus A-310s.  The first one was </p><p>delivered on schedule in 1990.  However, with the impact on </p><p>air travel due to the Gulf War, RJ was unable to make its </p><p>monthly payments and defaulted.  When Dahabi became CEO of RJ </p><p>in 1994, he said he noticed that RJ was paying JD1 million </p><p>($1.4 million) per month for the deal, "twice what anyone </p><p>else in the world was paying for A-310s".  He said RJ </p><p>defaulted again, and, following a restructuring of the deal, </p><p>is still paying $500,000 per month.  (Note: Despite the </p><p>government\'s and RJ\'s wariness over the 1987 deal, RJ </p><p>concluded a deal in January with Airbus to lease widebody </p><p>aircraft.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) Thus opens yet another chapter in an unnecessarily </p><p>long saga.  While the possibility of the SSC getting involved </p><p>in the RJ deal is intriguing, Boeing is likely to be </p><p>disappointed by the selection of an independent consultant to </p><p>analyze the Boeing/Airbus offers.  We are inclined to be </p><p>skeptical of the additional credibility it could bring to the </p><p>process, which has already been painstaking.  In the past, </p><p>Boeing has been reluctant to share proprietary information, </p><p>so a lot will depend on the consultant to be selected.  We </p><p>will continue to keep a close watch on the process, with </p><p>particular emphasis on the prospective benefits to the </p><p>bilateral relationship of contracts being awarded to Boeing </p><p>as soon as possible. </p><p>BERRY </p><p></p></div>
