<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KATHMANDU 001955 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS </p><p>LONDON FOR POL - RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/08/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, NP, Government of Nepal (GON), Political Parties </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL:  PARTIES LOOKING FOR "FLEXIBILITY" FROM KING </p><p> </p><p>REF: KATHMANDU 1947 AND PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: POL PMAHONEY.  REASON:  1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) The October 9 deadline set by King Gyanendra for </p><p>political parties to forward their nominations for the </p><p>interim Cabinet (Reftel) appears ready to pass without any </p><p>names having been submitted.  A Palace source said the </p><p>parties had so far sent no nominations to the King.  The </p><p>King, who does not want to allow the deadline to slip too </p><p>far, is reportedly weighing the possibility of announcing the </p><p>Prime Minister and two ministers by October 10--with or </p><p>without the consensus of the parties--and then tasking the </p><p>new PM with consulting with the parties on the other members </p><p>of the Cabinet.  The upcoming Dasain holiday (October 13-20) </p><p>can provide some much-needed breathing space to allow this </p><p>delicate process to play out, the source observed. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  Madhav Nepal, leader of the Communist Party of Nepal </p><p>- United Marxist Leninist (UML), told the Ambassador October </p><p>9 that his party views the King\'s action in sacking the </p><p>government of former Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba and </p><p>assuming executive power as unconstitutional.  Nonetheless, </p><p>the UML is looking ahead at how to deal with this new </p><p>reality.  Since the Nepali Congress has lost the moral </p><p>authority to govern, he stated, the UML has a legitimate </p><p>claim to the post of prime minister.  The UML is willing to </p><p>be flexible on this point, but the King should also show </p><p>"flexibility and large-heartedness" by choosing the PM and </p><p>forming the new government in consultation with the six </p><p>parties.  Not all members of the Cabinet have to be </p><p>politicians--some can be technocrats--but the post of Prime </p><p>Minister must be held by a political figure with the </p><p>experience and mass-based support needed to create the proper </p><p>atmosphere for holding elections.  Nepal said the six major </p><p>parties (minus the Deuba wing of the Nepali Congress) are </p><p>still seeking a joint meeting with the King to press their </p><p>views, which so far has not been granted.  That meeting may </p><p>be granted October 10, he believes.  He indicated that if the </p><p>six party leaders are allowed to meet together with the King, </p><p>the King might then meet separately with each, if he chooses, </p><p>to work out the details of the Cabinet.  By Nepal\'s </p><p>calculations, the King can extend the deadline for Cabinet </p><p>nominations to October 11 and still be able to form the </p><p>government before the Dasain holiday. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
