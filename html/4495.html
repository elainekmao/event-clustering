<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 008596 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EUR/SE, EB/IFD/OMA AND E </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA - MILLS AND LEICHTER </p><p>STATE PASS USTR - NOVELLI AND BIRDSEY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/02/2006 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKISH MARKETS AWAIT IMF REACTION TO COURT </p><p>DECISION ON PAMUKBANK </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 8545 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Economic Counselor Scot Marciel for reasons 1.5 </p><p>(b,d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary: Turkish markets are awaiting IMF and GOT </p><p>reaction to the administrative court decision of November 22, </p><p>which suspended the take-over of Pamukbank by the Banking </p><p>Regulation and Supervision Agency (BRSA).  At the heart of </p><p>this legal battle lie about $5 billion in loans made by Pamuk </p><p>and Yapi Kredi to their owner Cukurova Holding.  Cukurova\'s </p><p>legal challenge to the Pamuk take-over is part of the </p><p>bargaining over the repayment of these loans.  Failure to </p><p>reach agreement on repayment terms poses systemic risks to </p><p>the banking sector, given that Pamuk and Yapi Kredi have $12 </p><p>billion in deposits or about 15 percent of all deposits in </p><p>the Turkish banking system.  Markets will watch closely on </p><p>both this issue and the primary surplus issue during next </p><p>week\'s visit of IMF Europe Director Deppler, and the December </p><p>9 IMF Mission to Turkey.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) On November 22, BRSA Vice Presidents Ceyla </p><p>Pazarbasioglu and Teoman Kerman called us in to discuss the </p><p>court decision on Pamukbank (reftel).  They summed up the </p><p>situation as follows: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  The administrative court ("Danistay" or Council of </p><p>State), sitting in general assembly, suspended the BRSA\'s </p><p>June 18 take-over of Pamukbank.  According to press reports, </p><p>the reason for the suspension was that BRSA didn\'t </p><p>sufficiently consider Cukurova\'s recapitalization plan, which </p><p>would have merged the insolvent Pamuk into sister bank Yapi </p><p>Kredi.  BRSA will have 30 days (from the date of delivery of </p><p>the court\'s opinion, which hasn\'t yet occurred) to return </p><p>Pamuk to Cukurova, pending a final court decision on the </p><p>merits of the case.  The BRSA plans to continue defending in </p><p>court the merits of its take-over of Pamuk, though given this </p><p>interim court decision to suspend its action, the final </p><p>outcome doesn\'t look favorable to BRSA. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Since its take-over of Pamuk, BRSA has injected cash and </p><p>T-bills of  about $2 billion into Pamuk (about TL 2.7 </p><p>quadrillion in bills and TL 800 trillion in cash).  Local </p><p>media have publicized this injection of public funds, and </p><p>question whether Cukurova Holding will repay the BRSA. </p><p>Cukurova, according to press sources, plans to counter-claim </p><p>against the BRSA for damages, claiming that the BRSA\'s </p><p>take-over damaged the bank (the bank has lost over $1.5 </p><p>billion in deposits since the BRSA\'s June declaration of </p><p>insolvency and take-over). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  BRSA staff, and financial market analysts, expect that </p><p>Cukurova Holding will be unable to sufficiently recapitalize </p><p>Pamuk, and that this insolvent bank will eventually revert to </p><p>the BRSA.  Cukurova\'s legal challenge is seen as part of the </p><p>bargaining process with the BRSA over the repayment terms for </p><p>Cukurova\'s outstanding loans to both Pamuk and Yapi (totaling </p><p>nearly $5 billion).  Thus, while Cukurova may eventually be </p><p>forced to give up Pamuk, it may be able to bargain down with </p><p>the BRSA the amount of debt it owes its banks. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Pamuk\'s and Yapi Kredi\'s $5 billion in loans to owner </p><p>Cukurova Holding lie at the heart of the problem.  The </p><p>Pamuk/Yapi Kredi merger plan, presented last June by </p><p>Cukurova, involved large-scale forgiveness of these loans. </p><p>The BRSA rejected this plan.  Cukurova\'s subsequent failure </p><p>to make payments to these banks is gradually leading to the </p><p>insolvency of Yapi Kredi Bank.   In June, after the triple </p><p>audit under the recap plan, Yapi Kredi had positive equity of </p><p>about TL one quadrillion ($600 million), barely meeting the 8 </p><p>percent capital adequacy standard.  But its third quarter </p><p>results, to be released November 29, will show further </p><p>losses, bringing it under the 8 percent standard. </p><p>Furthermore, in light of Cukurova\'s continued failure to pay, </p><p>the BRSA should apply prudential standards that require Yapi </p><p>Kredi to increase its provisioning of capital for these </p><p>loans.  The general concern in the markets and in BRSA is </p><p>that, without an agreement with Cukurova over repaying the </p><p>loans, Yapi Kredi could well be insolvent by year-end. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Yapi Kredi treasurer Huseyin Imece told us November </p><p>25 that  the banks\' international creditors are worried, but </p><p>no one has cut credit lines to the bank yet.  Yapi Kredi will </p><p>repay a $225 million syndication loan to international banks </p><p>in early December.  The Turkish man in the street does not </p><p>appear worried as yet, and there is no run to withdraw </p><p>deposits.  But Imece doesn\'t know if the situation can hold </p><p>until year-end. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) The outcome of BRSA\'s legal battle with Cukurova </p><p>Holding (and its owner Mehmet Emin Karamehmet) poses systemic </p><p>risks to the financial system.   First, if the BRSA\'s </p><p>take-over of Pamuk is rolled back, the credibility of the </p><p>newly created BRSA as an effective bank regulator is in </p><p>question.  Second, Yapi Kredi and Pamuk together account for </p><p>$12 billion in deposits or 15 percent of all deposits in </p><p>Turkish banks.  Yapi Kredi holds billions of dollars of </p><p>T-bills as assets.  Giving Cukurova Holding back the banks, </p><p>without effectively recapitalizing them, leaves two large </p><p>sick players in the system relying most probably on overnight </p><p>funding from other local banks and/or the Central Bank. </p><p>Banks\' failures to make payments in the overnight market was </p><p>the proximate cause of both the November 2000 and February </p><p>2001 financial crises. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  The IMF\'s Deppler will arrive in Turkey next Monday, </p><p>December 2, to begin discussions with the new GOT.   Market </p><p>participants await IMF reaction to two issues:  this banking </p><p>reform problem; and the GOT\'s commitment to maintaining a 6.5 </p><p>percent primary surplus in 2003.   Per IMF resrep, IMF Deputy </p><p>Managing Director Krueger raised the Pamuk issue with State </p><p>Minister Babacan in a bilateral in New Delhi November 23l; </p><p>her talking point was that this is an urgent priority for the </p><p>GOT to fix.   In the meantime, locals markets remain </p><p>optimistic, based primarily on Turkey\'s chances of getting an </p><p>EU accession talks date in Copenhagen.  As JP Morgan/Chase </p><p>Treasurer told us, "my horizon is one week, and this week is </p><p>still optimistic.  Not sure about next week." </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
