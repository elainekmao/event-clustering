(C) SENIOR LEADERS RECENTLY HAVE EMPHASIZED FAMILIAR </p><p>IDEOLOGICAL THEMES ABOUT THE COMMUNIST PARTY\'S PREEMINENT </p><p>ROLE IN ALL MAJOR POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC DECISION-MAKING. </p><p>A FOCUS OF THIS CENTER-LED GOVERNING STYLE IS THE NEED FOR A </p><p>STRONG STATE SECTOR TO GUIDE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT.  IN THE </p><p>VIEW OF VIETNAM\'S IDEOLOGUES, MARKET REFORMS MUST BE </p><p>INCREMENTAL AND SUPPLEMENTAL TO THE STATE-LED BACKBONE OF </p><p>THE ECONOMY.  RECENT ARTICLES HAVE STRESSED THAT SOCIALIST </p><p>VIETNAM\'S HIGHEST PRIORITIES MUST ALWAYS BE TO REDUCE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00686  01 OF 07  050821Z </p><p>POVERTY AND HUNGER.  WHILE THESE ARE LAUDABLE GOALS, </p><p>VIETNAM\'S COMMAND-STYLE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL SERVICE SYSTEM </p><p>IS SEEN, IN LARGE PART, AS THE MECHANISM TO ACHIEVE THIS, </p><p>RATHER THAN ALLOWING GREATER ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL FREEDOM </p><p>FOLLOWING A MARKET-ORIENTED PARADIGM.  IN THE WORDS OF THE </p><p>PRIME MINISTER, VIETNAM IS A POOR COUNTRY THAT "CANNOT </p><p>COMPETE" WITH RICH COUNTRIES.  VIETNAM CONSTANTLY ARGUES IT </p><p>NEEDS MORE AID, DESPITE HAVING AID COMMITMENTS AND PLEDGES </p><p>TOTALING 28 PERCENT OF GDP. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) THOUGH THE PROCESS OF GLOBALIZATION IS ACKNOWLEDGED </p><p>TO BE INEVITABLE, SENIOR SRV OFFICIALS SEE IT AS LARGELY </p><p>NEGATIVE.  THIS IS HIGHLY IRONIC, BECAUSE CERTAIN SECTIONS </p><p>OF THE COUNTRY, ESPECIALLY HO CHI MINH CITY, ARE PROFOUNDLY </p><p>BENEFITING FROM GROWING TRADE WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD. </p><p>IN FACT, MOST VIETNAMESE SEE THE LEADERSHIP\'S MARXIST </p><p>SLOGANS AS IRRELEVANT TO THEIR DAILY LIVES.  BUT MANY </p><p>LEADERS IN HANOI ARE PROFOUNDLY FEARFUL OF HOW THE WEST, AND </p><p>PARTICULARLY THE U.S., MAY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF VIETNAM\'S </p><p>"WEAKNESSES."  THEY SEE UNBRIDLED ECONOMIC REFORM AND </p><p>LIBERALIZATION AS DESTABILIZING AND REFER TO SCIENCE AND </p><p>TECHNOLOGY AS TOOLS THAT INTERNATIONAL "IMPERIALISM" USES TO </p><p>SUBJUGATE POOR COUNTRIES.  THEY ALSO FEAR WESTERN EFFORTS TO </p><p>IMPOSE "MILITARY SOLUTIONS" IN OTHER COUNTRIES, SUCH AS IN </p><p>KOSOVO OR EAST TIMOR.  THOUGH THE COUNTRY\'S CONSERVATIVE </p><p>IDEOLOGUES CHAMPION THESE VIEWS MOST VIGOROUSLY, IN RECENT </p><p>MONTHS EVEN MORE TECHNOCRATIC MEMBERS SUCH AS THE PRIME </p><p>MINISTER AND FOREIGN MINISTER HAVE ECHOED THEM.  WE SENSE </p><p>VIETNAMESE LEADERS ARE EMBOLDENED BY THE STRONG CRITICISM OF </p><p>FREE TRADE AT THE SEATTLE WTO AND THE BANGKOK UNCTAD </p><p>MEETINGS.  THIS HEIGHTENED IDEOLOGICAL RHETORIC SUGGESTS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  00686  01 OF 07  050821Z </p><p>MAJOR ECONOMIC REFORMS ARE UNLIKELY BEFORE NEXT SPRING\'S </p><p>PARTY CONGRESS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>THE ROLE OF IDEOLOGY IN VIETNAM </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) THIS IS THE SECOND OF A TWO-PART SERIES ANALYZING THE </p><p>IDEOLOGICAL THEMES HIGHLIGHTED IN RECENT SPEECHES AND </p><p>PRONOUNCEMENTS BY COMMUNIST PARTY (CPV) LEADERS.  THESE </p><p>CABLES ANALYZE THEMES RAISED BY PARTY GENERAL SECRETARY LE </p><p>KHA PHIEU IN HIS SPEECH ON THE 70TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE </p><p>FOUNDING OF THE CPV; BY POLITBURO MEMBERS PHAM THE DUYET AND </p><p>NGUYEN PHU TRONG AND PARTY IDEOLOGISTS NHI LE AND NGUYEN </p><p>KHANH IN ARTICLES IN THE OFFICIAL COMMUNIST PARTY </p><p>THEORETICAL JOURNAL; AND BY PRIME MINISTER PHAN VAN KHAI AND </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER NGUYEN DY NIEN IN MEETINGS WITH FOREIGN </p><p>LEADERS.  THIS CABLE FOCUSES ON THE CPV\'S CONTINUING </p><p>ADHERENCE TO CENTRALLY DIRECTED ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND TO </p><p>THE POLITICAL, ECONOMIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL DANGERS VIETNAM\'S </p><p>LEADERS SEE IN GLOBALIZATION.  REF A FOCUSED ON THE </p><p>COMMUNIST PARTY\'S ROLE IN GUIDING THE VIETNAMESE STATE. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) WHILE THESE IDEOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES HAVE BEEN GETTING </p><p>INCREASED ATTENTION IN RECENT SPEECHES AND STATEMENTS, IT IS </p><p>IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT AMONG THE POPULATION AT LARGE, </p><p>MARXIST-LENINIST IDEOLOGY HAS FEW FOLLOWERS IN VIETNAM.  THE </p><p>AVERAGE PERSON ON THE STREET FINDS MUCH OF THIS TO BE </p><p>"BACKGROUND NOISE" THAT IS IRRELEVANT TO HIS OR HER DAILY </p><p>LIFE.  IN HO CHI MINH CITY, IN PARTICULAR, MANY PEOPLE ARE </p><p>QUICK TO VOICE THEIR DISDAIN FOR THE EMPTY SHIBBOLETHS THAT </p><p>ARE SPOUTED BY PARTY IDEOLOGUES.  THE PROCESSES OF "DE </p><p>FACTO" GLOBALIZATION AND INTERNATIONAL TRADE ARE MOST </p><p>ADVANCED IN THE SOUTH, AND PARTY AND GOVERNMENT LEADERS FROM </p><p>THAT REGION ARE, AS A GROUP, MUCH MORE OPEN TO ENGAGEMENT </p><p>WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD AND ATTUNED TO THE BENEFITS OF </p><p>GLOBALIZATION.  HOWEVER, IT WOULD BE A MISTAKE TO DISMISS </p><p>THE IDEOLOGICAL MANTRAS OF THE PARTY AND GOVERNMENT AS ONLY </p><p>EMPTY SLOGANS.  MARXIST-LENINIST IDEOLOGY REMAINS IMPORTANT </p><p>IN VIETNAM BECAUSE MANY OF THE SENIOR LEADERS EITHER </p><p>CONTINUE TO BE TRUE BELIEVERS -- OR THEY HIDE BEHIND THE </p><p>RHETORIC AS AN EXCUSE FOR NOT PRESSING FORWARD BRISKLY ON </p><p>REFORM.  IDEOLOGY IN VIETNAM IS MOST IMPORTANT FOR WHAT IT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00686  02 OF 07  050822Z </p><p>SAYS ABOUT THE NARROW CUPOLA OF LEADERS WHO HOLD THE REINS </p><p>OF ULTIMATE POLITICAL POWER. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p>IDEOLOGISTS STRESS STATE-LED DEVELOPMENT AS NECESSARY </p><p>FOR SOCIAL STABILITY; MARKET REFORMS GRADUAL AND MEASURED </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) FROM THEIR OWN PERSPECTIVE, THE COMMUNIST PARTY </p><p>LEADERS OF VIETNAM FACE A PROFOUND ECONOMIC DILEMMA: HOW TO </p><p>OPEN UP THE ECONOMY AND BENEFIT FROM INCREASED TRADE AND </p><p>INVESTMENT WITHOUT RISKING LOSS OF SOCIAL STABILITY AND THE </p><p>POTENTIAL LOSS OF THEIR MONOPOLY ON POWER.  WE HAVE HEARD </p><p>FROM MANY GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS THAT THE DEBATE IN VIETNAM IS </p><p>NOT ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT TO MOVE FORWARD -- BUT AT WHAT PACE </p><p>TO DO SO.  MANY OF VIETNAM\'S SENIOR LEADERS HAVE AN INHERENT </p><p>CAUTION ABOUT PROCEEDING "TOO RAPIDLY" WITH ECONOMIC </p><p>LIBERALIZATION AND MARKET REFORMS.  IN THE ABSENCE OF A </p><p>CONSENSUS TO MOVE FORWARD BOLDLY ON REFORM, THE PARTY </p><p>PRESERVES ITS PATERNALISTIC, STATE-LED ECONOMIC MODEL THAT </p><p>GRADUALLY INTRODUCES GREATER "MARKET CHARACTERISTICS" IN A </p><p>CONTROLLED, MEASURED WAY. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) IN HIS SPEECH COMMEMORATING THE 70TH ANNIVERSARY OF </p><p>THE CPV IN FEBRUARY, GENERAL SECRETARY PHIEU EXTOLLED </p><p>SOCIALISM AS THE MEANS FOR DEVELOPMENT IN VIETNAM.  HE SAID </p><p>VIETNAM MUST BUILD "A HIGHLY DEVELOPED ECONOMY WITH MODERN </p><p>PRODUCTION FORCES AND WITH STATE OWNERSHIP OF ALL KEY </p><p>PRODUCTION AREAS."  VIETNAM WILL DEVELOP ALL "ECONOMIC </p><p>SECTORS, INCLUDING STATE ENTERPRISES, COOPERATIVES, FAMILY </p><p>BUSINESSES, FARMS, PRIVATE COMPANIES, AND JOINT VENTURES </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  00686  02 OF 07  050822Z </p><p>WITH FOREIGN PARTNERS."  HE CONTINUED THAT THE STATE ECONOMY </p><p>AND THE COOPERATIVE-BASED ECONOMY WILL FORM "A FOUNDATION </p><p>FOR OUR NATIONAL ECONOMY."  FURTHER PARROTING THE 1992 </p><p>CONSTITUTION, HE ADDED THAT ALL ECONOMIC SECTORS WILL BE </p><p>EQUAL.  PHIEU SAID, "IT IS TOTALLY CORRECT WHEN OUR PARTY </p><p>EMPHASIZES AND CONSOLIDATES THE LEADING ROLE OF THE STATE </p><p>ECONOMY."  HE SAID THE STATE SECTOR SHOULD "SERVE AS A </p><p>CENTER TO ACCELERATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF OTHER ECONOMIC </p><p>SECTORS, MAINTAIN STABILITY DURING COMPLICATED </p><p>CIRCUMSTANCES, AND IMPLEMENT THE MARKET-ORIENTED ECONOMY </p><p>UNDER STATE MANAGEMENT WITH A SOCIALIST ORIENTATION." </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) PHIEU FURTHER NOTES THAT ELIMINATING HUNGER AND </p><p>REDUCING POVERTY ARE KEY ECONOMIC PRIORITIES.  BY LAUDING </p><p>THE SUCCESSES OF VIETNAM\'S ANTI-POVERTY EFFORTS THUS FAR, </p><p>PHIEU SEEMS TO BE ARGUING FOR CONTINUING A FUNDAMENTALLY </p><p>CENTRALLY PLANNED MODEL OF POVERTY REDUCTION, RATHER THAN </p><p>SEEKING TO PROMOTE PROSPERITY THROUGH GREATER ECONOMIC AND </p><p>POLITICAL FREEDOM.  (COMMENT: ADMITTEDLY THIS MAY IMPACT </p><p>DIFFERENT REGIONS AND SECTORS DIFFERENTLY.  END COMMENT.) </p><p>PHIEU GOES ON TO URGE THAT VIETNAM EXPAND ITS "ECONOMIC </p><p>COOPERATION" WITH OTHER COUNTRIES AND PRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS </p><p>OF HIGH QUALITY SO THAT VIETNAM CAN COMPETE WITH OTHER </p><p>COUNTRIES.  HOWEVER, THE PRIMACY OF THE STATE SECTOR IS </p><p>CLEAR IN HIS ECONOMIC WORLDVIEW. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) SIMILARLY, IN A MARCH ARTICLE OUTLINING VIETNAM\'S </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS POLICY IN THE PARTY NEWSPAPER "THE PEOPLE" </p><p>("NHAN DAN"), PARTY FUNCTIONARY PHAM VAN KHANH STRESSED THE </p><p>IMPORTANCE OF STATE EFFORTS TO REDUCE POVERTY.  "THE MOST </p><p>FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUE IN VIETNAM IS TO MAKE IT </p><p>POSSIBLE FOR THE PEOPLE TO HAVE ADEQUATE FOOD, CLOTHES AND </p><p>ACCESS TO EDUCATION."  KHANH WROTE THAT "PAYING ATTENTION TO </p><p>ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT TO RAISE THE ENTIRE PEOPLE\'S LIVING </p><p>STANDARDS, IMPLEMENTING POLICIES ON HUNGER ELIMINATION, AND </p><p>POVERTY REDUCTION ARE REALLY THE PRIMARY CONCERN OF THE </p><p>PARTY AND STATE OF VIETNAM."  KHANH SAYS THE SRV IS </p><p>PERFECTING ITS SOCIAL SERVICES SYSTEM AND DEVELOPING A </p><p>SOCIAL WELFARE NETWORK TO GUARANTEE THESE RIGHTS. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) COMMENT: VIETNAM HAS RECEIVED GENEROUS SUPPORT AND </p><p>STRONG ENCOURAGEMENT FROM THE IFI\'S AND BILATERAL DONORS FOR </p><p>THE SUCCESSES OF ITS LARGELY STATE-LED APPROACH TO POVERTY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00686  03 OF 07  050822Z </p><p>REDUCTION.  DURING THE VISIT OF WORLD BANK PRESIDENT </p><p>WOLFENSOHN IN MARCH -- AND THROUGHOUT VIETNAM\'S ONGOING </p><p>ENGAGEMENT WITH LOCAL WORLD BANK, ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK, </p><p>AND UN AGENCY OFFICIALS -- VIETNAM GETS CONSISTENTLY HIGH </p><p>MARKS FOR ITS SUCCESSES IN REDUCING THE POVERTY RATE.  GIVEN </p><p>THIS ONGOING CHORUS OF PRAISE FROM MANY INTERNATIONAL </p><p>DONORS, WHICH IS SUPPORTED TANGIBLY WITH PLEDGES OF MORE </p><p>THAN $2 BILLION ANNUALLY IN MULTILATERAL AND BILATERAL </p><p>ASSISTANCE, NO WONDER THE GVN FEELS JUSTIFIED IN "STAYING </p><p>THE COURSE" WITH A HEAVILY STATE-LED MACROECONOMIC APPROACH </p><p>THAT EMPHASIZES POVERTY REDUCTION AND WHICH IS BASED IN </p><p>LARGE PART ON ABUNDANT AID FLOWS.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>PLAYING POKER WITH A BAD HAND: </p><p>WE NEED AID AND SPECIAL TREATMENT </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) VIETNAMESE LEADERS ROUTINELY EMPHASIZE THAT VIETNAM </p><p>IS A POOR, UNDERDEVELOPED COUNTRY THAT IS APPROACHING GLOBAL </p><p>TRADE FROM A POSITION OF WEAKNESS.  PHIEU WAS CANDID IN </p><p>ADMITTING THAT VIETNAM MUST BE "VIGILANT" IN PROCEEDING WITH </p><p>ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT.  HE SAID THE SRV FACES "NUMEROUS </p><p>OPPONENTS FROM MORE DEVELOPED ECONOMIES, STRONGER POWERS AND </p><p>BETTER POSITIONS."  OVERALL, THE TONE IS THAT VIETNAM MUST </p><p>BE CAUTIOUS AND CAREFUL, LEST IT BE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF IN </p><p>RELATIONS WITH STRONGER POWERS. </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) WHILE DISCUSSING THE U.S.-VIETNAM BILATERAL TRADE </p><p>AGREEMENT (BTA) WITH VISITING SECDEF COHEN, PRIME MINISTER </p><p>KHAI WAS VERY POINTED IN SAYING THAT VIETNAM CANNOT COMPETE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  00686  03 OF 07  050822Z </p><p>WITH OTHER COUNTRIES SUCH AS THE U.S.  HE SAID THAT, WITHIN </p><p>THE BILATERAL TRADE AGREEMENT NEGOTIATIONS, THERE MUST BE </p><p>PROVISIONS THAT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT "THE REALITY THAT VIETNAM </p><p>IS AN UNDERDEVELOPED COUNTRY."  KHAI FURTHER MADE A PITCH </p><p>FOR INCREASED ASSISTANCE TO VIETNAM, SAYING THE U.S. "CANNOT </p><p>UNDERSTAND THE FULL DIFFICULTIES WE ARE FACING."  KHAI MADE </p><p>AN APPEAL BASED ON VIETNAM\'S LOSSES OF "MORE THAN 3 MILLION </p><p>PERSONS," BOTH MILITARY AND CIVILIAN, DURING WARTIME.  HE </p><p>SAID THE GVN CONTINUES TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO 1.2 MILLION </p><p>FAMILIES WHO LOST RELATIVES DURING THE WAR, AS WELL AS TO </p><p>THOSE WHO ALLEGEDLY WERE HARMED BY "CHEMICALS" DURING THE </p><p>WAR. </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) POLITBURO MEMBER NGUYEN PHU TRONG, CURRENTLY HEAD OF </p><p>THE HANOI PARTY COMMITTEE, RAISED THE THEME OF VIETNAM\'S </p><p>WEAKNESS IN A RECENT ARTICLE IN "COMMUNIST REVIEW."  TRONG </p><p>OBSERVED, "THE NATIONAL AND CLASS STRUGGLES ARE PROCEEDING </p><p>IN A VERY INTENSE AND FIERCE MANNER.  THE SCIENTIFIC AND </p><p>TECHNOLOGICAL REVOLUTION IS DEVELOPING TEMPESTUOUSLY. </p><p>MEANWHILE, OUR CAPACITY FOR COMPREHENSION AND INTELLECTUAL </p><p>LEVEL ARE LIMITED."  TRONG FEARS THAT "HOSTILE FORCES ARE </p><p>TRYING TO ATTACK AND UNDERMINE OUR PEOPLE\'S REVOLUTIONARY </p><p>CAUSE BY ALL MEANS.  THEY HAVE MADE EVERY EFFORT TO </p><p>MISREPRESENT AND SLANDER OUR PARTY AND STATE AND DIRECTLY </p><p>STRIKE AT THE IDEOLOGICAL SYSTEM, POLITICAL PROGRAM AND </p><p>POLITICAL LINE OF OUR PARTY IN AN ATTEMPT TO CAUSE OUR PARTY </p><p>TO DISINTEGRATE FROM ITS ROOTS AND FROM WITHIN." </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>THE DANGERS OF GLOBALIZATION </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) REINFORCING THE NEED FOR A STRONG STATE SECTOR AND </p><p>THE RISKS OF ECONOMIC REFORM, IN THE EYES OF SRV LEADERS, </p><p>ARE THEIR FEARS ABOUT THE HARMFUL EFFECTS OF GLOBALIZATION. </p><p>ON REPEATED OCCASIONS VIETNAMESE LEADERS HAVE VOICED THEIR </p><p>CONCERNS ABOUT THE INSTABILITY BROUGHT TO THE REGION BY THE </p><p>EAST ASIAN FINANCIAL CRISIS.  PARTICULARLY ATTENTION-GETTING </p><p>IN HANOI WAS THE IMPACT OF THE REGIONAL CRISIS ON THE </p><p>POLITICAL STABILITY OF THE FORMERLY DE FACTO ONE-PARTY STATE </p><p>OF INDONESIA.  ALSO OF CONCERN WAS THE IMPACT OF THE CRISIS </p><p>IN SETTING BACK POVERTY REDUCTION EFFORTS IN THAT COUNTRY </p><p>AND OTHERS. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00686  04 OF 07  050823Z </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) IN RECENT SPEECHES AND STATEMENTS, SENIOR LEADERS </p><p>HAVE SPOKEN OF GLOBALIZATION IN HIGHLY AMBIVALENT WAYS. </p><p>THOUGH SEEN AS AN "INEVITABLE" PROCESS, GLOBALIZATION IS </p><p>VIEWED AS A LARGELY NEGATIVE PHENOMENON THAT MUST BE MANAGED </p><p>CAREFULLY.  (COMMENT: THIS IS IN CONTRAST TO HOW MANY IN THE </p><p>WEST SEE VIETNAM, BELIEVING THAT GLOBALIZATION PROVIDES </p><p>ENORMOUS OPPORTUNITIES FOR A POOR COUNTRY WITH GREAT HUMAN </p><p>RESOURCES, LIKE VIETNAM, TO MAKE QUICK PROGRESS </p><p>DEVELOPMENTALLY.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>15. (C) AT THE MEETING OF THE UNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE ON </p><p>TRADE AND DEVELOPMENT (UNCTAD) IN BANGKOK FEBRUARY 13, PM </p><p>KHAI NOTED THAT THE TRENDS OF GLOBALIZATION AND </p><p>REGIONALIZATION OFFER BOTH OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES FOR </p><p>UNDERDEVELOPED COUNTRIES LIKE VIETNAM.  KHAI SAID NO </p><p>NATIONAL ECONOMY "CAN EXIST INDEPENDENTLY AMIDST THE GROWING </p><p>INTERDEPENDENCE OF NATIONAL ECONOMIES."  IN ORDER FOR POOR </p><p>COUNTRIES TO BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY, </p><p>THEY NEED SPECIAL TREATMENT.  HE OPINED THAT GLOBALIZATION </p><p>REQUIRES THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY "TO PAY SPECIAL </p><p>ATTENTION TO MAPPING OUT SOLUTIONS THAT BENEFIT POOR AND </p><p>BACKWARD COUNTRIES."  HE SAID DEVELOPING COUNTRIES ARE "IN </p><p>GREAT NEED OF ACTIVE ASSISTANCE FROM DEVELOPED COUNTRIES TO </p><p>COMPREHENSIVELY AND EQUALLY ENGAGE IN INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC </p><p>RELATIONS."  HE SAID WTO DEVELOPED MEMBERS "SHOULD GIVE </p><p>PRIORITY ... TO (CREATING) FAVORABLE CONDITIONS FOR THOSE </p><p>COUNTRIES THAT ARE NEGOTIATING FOR WTO MEMBERSHIP."  THE </p><p>AGENDA OF THE WTO SHOULD CREATE "A MORE FAVORABLE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION ENVIRONMENT" AND ALLOW THEM TO </p><p>"ENJOY SPECIAL PRIORITY (TREATMENT) WITHOUT ANY KIND OF </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  00686  04 OF 07  050823Z </p><p>DISCRIMINATION." </p><p> </p><p>16. (C) IN HIS 70TH ANNIVERSARY SPEECH, GENERAL SECRETARY </p><p>PHIEU OUTLINED A PROFOUNDLY NEGATIVE VIEW OF GLOBALIZATION. </p><p>AFTER TRACING THE HISTORICAL ROLE OF IMPERIALISM IN </p><p>SUBJUGATING PEOPLES IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD, PHIEU GOES ON </p><p>TO STATE THAT IMPERIALISM STILL EXISTS, BUT IT HAS ADOPTED </p><p>DIFFERENT FORMS.  "IMPERIALIST FORCES HAVE EXPANDED THE </p><p>WORLD MARKET EVERYWHERE FOR MAXIMUM PROFIT.  AT THE SAME </p><p>TIME, COUNTRIES WHICH HAVE REGAINED INDEPENDENCE RECENTLY </p><p>AFTER A LONG PERIOD OF SLAVERY ARE POOR, BACKWARD, AND </p><p>LOOKING FOR WAYS TO DEVELOP."  HE SAID THEY NEED CAPITAL, </p><p>SCIENCE, HIGH TECHNOLOGY, MANAGEMENT EXPERIENCE, </p><p>INTELLECTUALS, AND SKILLED WORKERS.  BUT, HE ADDS, "THESE </p><p>THINGS ARE IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO OBTAIN UNDER THE </p><p>DOMINATION OF IMPERIALISM."  PHIEU SAYS THAT DEVELOPING </p><p>COUNTRIES MUST DEVISE NEW STRATEGIES "TO DEAL WITH NEW AND </p><p>UNFAIR TRICKS PLAYED ON THEM BY THEIR OPPONENTS."  (COMMENT: </p><p>EVEN IF THIS IS LARGELY IDEOLOGICAL BOILERPLATE FOR THE </p><p>PARTY FAITHFUL, IT IS REVEALING FOR ITS EXCESSIVE CONCERN, </p><p>EVEN PARANOIA, ABOUT THE HARMFUL EFFECTS OF ENGAGING THE </p><p>WORLD.  PHIEU\'S VIEW IS THAT GLOBALIZATION IS A ZERO-SUM </p><p>GAME, AND VIETNAM IS LIKELY TO GET THE SHORT END OF THE </p><p>STICK.  IN SEVERAL PLACES, HE VIRTUALLY EQUATES </p><p>GLOBALIZATION AND IMPERIALISM.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>17. (C) TAKING THEIR CUES FROM PARTY LEADERS, GOVERNMENT </p><p>OFFICIALS LIKEWISE ARE SOUNDING THESE NOTES, IF NOT AS </p><p>HARSHLY AS PHIEU.  FOREIGN MINISTER NIEN, ON HIS FIRST </p><p>OFFICIAL TRIP TO JAPAN MARCH 10 AFTER ASSUMING HIS POST THE </p><p>MONTH BEFORE, URGED JAPANESE FOREIGN MINISTER KONO TO </p><p>HIGHLIGHT THE DETRIMENTAL ASPECTS OF ECONOMIC GLOBALIZATION </p><p>WHEN JAPAN HOSTS THE GROUP OF EIGHT MEETING IN JULY, </p><p>ACCORDING TO A JAPANESE MFA OFFICIAL QUOTED BY THE KYODO </p><p>NEWS SERVICE.  IN THE SAME WAY, DEPUTY NATIONAL ASSEMBLY </p><p>CHAIRMAN VU DINH CU SPOKE OUT MARCH 6 IN THE COMMUNIST PARTY </p><p>MOUTHPIECE "NHAN DAN" ("THE PEOPLE") ABOUT THE IMPACT </p><p>GLOBALIZATION WOULD HAVE ON VIETNAM.  CU SAID "RAPID OPENING </p><p>OF THE GLOBAL MARKET" WOULD LEAD TO MASSIVE BANKRUPTCY OF </p><p>VIETNAMESE COMPANIES THAT ARE WEAK IN FINANCIAL, </p><p>TECHNOLOGICAL AND MANAGEMENT CAPABILITIES.  THIS WOULD </p><p>RESULT IN GREATLY INCREASED UNEMPLOYMENT, HE SAID. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00686  05 OF 07  050823Z </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>GLOBALIZATION CREATES MORE POOR PEOPLE </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>18. (C) PRIME MINISTER KHAI TOOK THIS THEME ONE STEP FURTHER </p><p>WHEN HE TOLD VISITING SECDEF COHEN MARCH 13 THAT </p><p>GLOBALIZATION WILL INCREASE THE NUMBER OF POOR PEOPLE.  KHAI </p><p>SAID GLOBALIZATION AND INTEGRATION ARE "STILL CONTROVERSIAL </p><p>ISSUES" IN VIETNAM.  SPEAKING OF HIS ATTENDANCE AT THE </p><p>UNCTAD CONFERENCE IN BANGKOK, KHAI SAID THERE WAS A LOT OF </p><p>CONTROVERSY BETWEEN RICH AND POOR COUNTRIES, PARTICULARLY </p><p>OVER HOW TO BRIDGE THE GAP OF WEALTH BETWEEN THEM.  HE ADDED </p><p>THAT VIETNAM RECOGNIZES GLOBALIZATION IS "THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>TENDENCY, WHICH WE CANNOT AVOID."  BUT HE SAID EACH COUNTRY </p><p>NEEDS TO CHOOSE ITS OWN APPROACH TO DEVELOP ITSELF AND RAISE </p><p>LIVING STANDARDS. </p><p> </p><p>19. (C) COMMENT: IT IS STRIKING HOW NEGATIVELY EVEN </p><p>VIETNAM\'S MORE TECHNOCRATIC/REFORMIST LEADERS, SUCH AS KHAI, </p><p>SEE THE PROCESS OF GLOBALIZATION.  THEIR WARINESS REINFORCES </p><p>THEIR CAUTION, AND CAUSES THE LEADERSHIP AS A GROUP TO FAVOR </p><p>SHORT-TERM STABILITY RATHER THAN OPEN UP THE ECONOMY IN WAYS </p><p>THAT WOULD PAY LONG-TERM REWARDS.  HOWEVER, THE CHALLENGES </p><p>ARE DAUNTING: MORE THAN ONE MILLION NEW JOBS NEED TO BE </p><p>CREATED EVERY YEAR IN THIS EXTRAORDINARILY YOUNG COUNTRY IN </p><p>ORDER TO KEEP UP WITH POPULATION GROWTH.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>20. (C) PREDICTABLY, IN HIS 70TH ANNIVERSARY SPEECH, PHIEU </p><p>TOUCHED ON THIS THEME AS WELL.  HE STATED, "WHEN IMPERIALISM </p><p>ACCELERATES THE LIBERALIZATION OF WORLD TRADE, SERVICE AND </p><p>INVESTMENT, RICH COUNTRIES WILL BECOME RICHER, AND THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  00686  05 OF 07  050823Z </p><p>POVERTY GAP BETWEEN RICH COUNTRIES AND POOR COUNTRIES WILL </p><p>BECOME WIDER." </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>A SCREED AGAINST TECHNOLOGY </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>21. (C) THE MORE IDEOLOGICAL MEMBERS OF THE POLITBURO, SUCH </p><p>AS PHIEU AND TRONG, ALSO HAVE RAILED AGAINST DELETERIOUS </p><p>ASPECTS OF SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES.  PHIEU\'S </p><p>70TH ANNIVERSARY SPEECH WAS THE MOST JARRING, THOUGH THERE </p><p>HAVE BEEN ECHOES ELSEWHERE AS WELL (SUCH AS BY TRONG, CITED </p><p>PARA 11 ABOVE).  COMING DEEP OUT OF LEFT FIELD, PHIEU </p><p>CLAIMED THAT "CAPITALISM AND IMPERIALISM WERE BROUGHT TO </p><p>LIFE BY THE DEVELOPMENT OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY."  HE GOES </p><p>ON TO NOTE, POSITIVELY, THAT SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL </p><p>ACHIEVEMENTS IN THE 21ST CENTURY CAN HELP BRING ABOUT BETTER </p><p>AND MORE CIVILIZED LIVING CONDITIONS.  BUT HERE AGAIN THE </p><p>OVERRIDING TONE IS ONE OF CONCERN: "PEOPLE ARE STILL </p><p>WORRIED."  HISTORY HAS SHOWN, PHIEU SAID, THAT "A HIGHER </p><p>LEVEL OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY WILL BRING ABOUT A HIGHER </p><p>AND MORE SEVERE LEVEL OF WAR AND ECONOMIC CRISIS." </p><p> </p><p>22. (C) COMMENT: IN A UNIQUE VARIATION ON THE CLASSIC </p><p>THEORY, PHIEU SEEMS TO BELIEVE IN AN "INVISIBLE HAND" THAT </p><p>IS SOMEHOW AT WORK IN THE GLOBAL TRADING SYSTEM AND </p><p>TECHNOLOGICAL TRANSFER TO ATTEMPT TO SUBVERT THE INTERESTS </p><p>OF VIETNAM.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>THE DANGERS OF A MONO-POLAR WORLD </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>23. (C) THESE CONCERNS ABOUT THE HARMFUL ASPECTS OF </p><p>GLOBALIZATION ECONOMICALLY AND TECHNOLOGICALLY ARE ALSO </p><p>REFLECTED IN VIETNAMESE LEADERS\' VIEWS OF INTERNATIONAL </p><p>RELATIONS.  PHIEU SAID, "AFTER THE COLLAPSE OF THE SOVIET </p><p>UNION AND THE SOCIALIST COUNTRIES IN EASTERN EUROPE, THE </p><p>IMPERIALIST FORCES HAVE CONTINUOUSLY SOUGHT WAYS TO TOTALLY </p><p>ELIMINATE THE REMAINING SOCIALIST COUNTRIES AND HAVE WAGED </p><p>WARS AGAINST MOVEMENTS OF INDEPENDENCE, DEMOCRACY AND SOCIAL </p><p>PROGRESS."  IN PARTICULAR, NATO MILITARY OPERATIONS AGAINST </p><p>THE BOSNIAN SERBS IN BOSNIA AND AGAINST SERBIA OVER KOSOVO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00686  06 OF 07  050823Z </p><p>HEIGHTENED VIETNAMESE CONCERNS ABOUT THE DANGERS OF U.S. </p><p>MILITARY ACTION.  PHIEU SAID, "ALL PEOPLE ARE CLOSELY </p><p>FOLLOWING NEW DEVELOPMENTS AFTER THE KOSOVO INCIDENT."  HE </p><p>SAID, "OTHER DEVELOPED COUNTRIES ARE TRYING TO INCREASE </p><p>POWER TO FRUSTRATE THE CONSPIRACY TO ESTABLISH \'A MONO-POLAR </p><p>ORDER IN A MULTI-POLAR WORLD.\'"  (COMMENT: NATO\'S BOMBING OF </p><p>BELGRADE BECAUSE OF THE CONFLICT IN KOSOVO RESONATED DEEPLY </p><p>IN HANOI, WHICH HAS NOT FORGOTTEN U.S. BOMBING OF NORTHERN </p><p>VIETNAMESE CITIES THREE DECADES AGO.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>24. (C) FOREIGN MINISTER NIEN, IN HIS FEBRUARY 17 SPEECH TO </p><p>THE DIPLOMATIC CORPS OUTLINING VIETNAM\'S FOREIGN POLICY </p><p>PRIORITIES, SAID VIETNAM WILL PRESS FORWARD WITH </p><p>INTERNATIONAL AND REGIONAL INTEGRATION.  HE SAID VIETNAM </p><p>WILL ALSO SEEK TO PROMOTE TIES WITH MAJOR POWERS AND </p><p>NEIGHBORING STATES, WHILE ALSO SEEKING TO STEP UP RELATIONS </p><p>WITH "TRADITIONAL FRIENDS AND THE NON-ALIGNED MOVEMENT." </p><p>(WE NOTE THAT IN THE PAST SEVERAL MONTHS, VIETNAM HAS </p><p>ARRANGED HIGH-LEVEL VISITS OR FOCUSED INCREASED ATTENTION ON </p><p>RUSSIA, IRAQ, CUBA AND NORTH KOREA.)  NIEN SAID THAT, IN </p><p>ORDER TO STRENGTHEN ITS INDEPENDENCE AND SOVEREIGNTY, HANOI </p><p>WILL SEEK TO FURTHER DIVERSIFY ITS FOREIGN RELATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>25. (C) PHAM THE DUYET, THE FIFTH-RANKING POLITBURO MEMBER </p><p>AND HEAD OF THE FATHERLAND FRONT, RECENTLY OUTLINED A HIGHLY </p><p>IDEOLOGICAL VIEW OF THE ROLE OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY IN </p><p>VIETNAM\'S FOREIGN RELATIONS.  IN AN ARTICLE ON "THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL MISSION OF THE PARTY" PUBLISHED IN FEBRUARY IN </p><p>THE COMMUNIST REVIEW, HE EMPHASIZED THAT MARXISM-LENINISM </p><p>AND HO CHI MINH THOUGHT FORM THE FOUNDATION OF VIETNAM\'S </p><p>FOREIGN POLICY, ARISING FROM THE COUNTRY\'S REVOLUTIONARY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  00686  06 OF 07  050823Z </p><p>TRADITION.  HE CAUTIONED VIETNAM MUST REMAIN TRUE TO THIS </p><p>HERITAGE TO AVOID THE ERRORS OF THE FORMER COMMUNIST STATES </p><p>IN THE SOVIET UNION AND EASTERN EUROPE, WHICH COLLAPSED </p><p>AFTER THEY TRIED TO "REFORM."  HE ALSO HARSHLY CRITICIZED </p><p>U.S.-LED NATO EFFORTS IN THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA.  HE SAID, </p><p>"AMERICAN IMPERIALISM CARRIES OUT A HARD-LINE HEGEMONISTIC </p><p>POLICY OF PRESSURING AND INTERFERING IN THE AFFAIRS OF OTHER </p><p>COUNTRIES.  THE WAR OF AGGRESSION AGAINST YUGOSLAVIA CARRIED </p><p>OUT BY AMERICA AND NATO IS A GRAPHIC RECENT EXAMPLE."  DUYET </p><p>ADDED A WORD OF CAUTION: "IN THE PROCESS OF INTEGRATION WITH </p><p>THE WORLD ECONOMY, WE MUST GRASP FIRMLY (THE PRINCIPLE) OF </p><p>SIMULTANEOUS STRUGGLE AND COOPERATION." </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>IDEOLOGY\'S SHADOW: HISTORY HAS NOT ENDED IN VIETNAM </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>26. (C) COMMENT: WHEN ONE ANALYZES RECENT SPEECHES AND </p><p>STATEMENTS BY VIETNAMESE LEADERS, ONE IS STRUCK BY THE </p><p>STRONG UNDERCURRENT OF IDEOLOGICAL RHETORIC.  AT ONE LEVEL, </p><p>THIS CAN BE ASCRIBED TO VIETNAM\'S "PRIMARY SEASON" IN THE </p><p>RUN-UP TO THE ELECTIONS FOR NEXT SPRING\'S NINTH PARTY </p><p>CONGRESS.  HOWEVER, THIS RATCHETING UP OF IDEOLOGICAL THEMES </p><p>SHOULD NOT BE DISMISSED LIGHTLY.  WHILE AT A SURFACE LEVEL </p><p>VIETNAM\'S LEADERS SAY THEY DO NOT WANT TO FOCUS ON THE </p><p>LEGACY OF THE WAR-TIME YEARS, THE HISTORY OF CONFLICT THREE </p><p>DECADES AGO CONTINUES TO PROFOUNDLY SHAPE THE WORLDVIEW OF </p><p>THE COUNTRY\'S SENIOR LEADERS.  MANY OF THEM ARE FEARFUL AND </p><p>SUSPICIOUS OF WESTERN, AND ESPECIALLY AMERICAN, INTENTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>27. (C) COMMENT (CONT\'D): AS WE CONTINUE TO PRESS FORWARD </p><p>SEEKING A BILATERAL TRADE AGREEMENT AND OTHER MAJOR REFORMS, </p><p>WE NEED TO REMEMBER THAT MANY SENIOR LEADERS ARE DEEPLY </p><p>DISTRUSTFUL OF THE U.S.  THEIR FUNDAMENTAL CAUTION AND </p><p>CONSENSUS-ORIENTED NATURE, COMBINED WITH A GENUINE FEAR OF </p><p>BEING HOODWINKED BY THE WEST, COMBINE TO DISCOURAGE MAJOR </p><p>PROGRESS ON ECONOMIC REFORM.  THOUGH WE HAVE MADE GREAT </p><p>STRIDES IN BUILDING CONSTRUCTIVE RELATIONS WITH WORKING- </p><p>LEVEL SRV OFFICIALS AND INCREASING THEIR APPRECIATION FOR </p><p>THE BENEFITS OF ENGAGING THE GLOBAL COMMUNITY, THE SECRETIVE </p><p>AND INSULAR POLITBURO IS ANOTHER STORY.  IN THE SEAT OF </p><p>ULTIMATE POLITICAL POWER, PARTY VETERANS CONTINUE TO USE </p><p>IDEOLOGICAL SLOGANS TO RESIST MOVING FORWARD ON REFORM. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00686  07 OF 07  050824Z </p><p>THEY DO THIS FOR SEVERAL REASONS: TO PROTECT THEIR PERSONAL </p><p>PERKS OF POWER, TO GUARD AGAINST THE SOCIAL INSTABILITY THEY </p><p>GENUINELY FEAR, AND TO CONFRONT WHAT THEY SEE AS A U.S. </p><p>"GLOBAL STRATEGY" OF POWER PROJECTION THAT IMPOSES "AMERICAN </p><p>SOLUTIONS" IN PLACES SUCH AS KOSOVO AND EAST TIMOR.  IN SUM, </p><p>THERE IS AN ENORMOUS GAP BETWEEN HOW THEY AND WE SEE </p><p>GLOBALIZATION AND VIETNAM\'S ENGAGEMENT WITH THE REST OF THE </p><p>WORLD.  OUR HOPE IS THAT, IN TIME, VIETNAM\'S LEADERSHIP WILL </p><p>BE ABLE TO SHED SOME OF ITS IDEOLOGICAL DEAD SKIN.  UNTIL </p><p>THAT HAPPENS, HOWEVER, THIS COUNTRY OF DYNAMIC, HARD-WORKING </p><p>PEOPLE WITH A STRONG COMMITMENT TO EDUCATION WILL CONTINUE </p><p>TO BE HELD BACK BY ITS LEADERS, MANY OF WHOM SUBSCRIBE TO </p><p>STERILE IDEOLOGICAL MANTRAS FROM ANOTHER ERA.  END COMMENT. </p><p>PETERSON </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> </p><p></p><p> 2000HANOI00686 - CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
