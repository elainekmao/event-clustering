<p>UNCLAS HANOI 000702 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINS, CASC, IZ, VM </p><p>SUBJECT:  TFIZ01:  VIETNAM UPDATE MARCH 21 </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A.  HANOI 0684  B. HANOI 0676  C.  HANOI 0651 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  Vietnamese television, radio, and newspapers on </p><p>March 20 and March 21 highlighted international protests </p><p>against military action in Iraq, including another slew of </p><p>mass pro-peace "meetings" throughout Vietnam that were </p><p>described as involving at least tens of thousands of </p><p>Vietnamese citizens in various locations.  However, coverage </p><p>was virtually non-existent of the very small student </p><p>protests across the street from the Chancery on March 19 and </p><p>March 20.  (Comment:  Failure to publicize these protests </p><p>may indicate that they did not have any official sanction </p><p>and that the GVN does not want to encourage any spontaneous </p><p>demonstrations on this or other issues.  End comment) </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  Media also emphasized the tough remarks made by the </p><p>Foreign Ministry spokeswoman on May 20, calling the military </p><p>action a "gross violation of the fundamental principles of </p><p>international law" that was an "extremely dangerous </p><p>precedent," condemning the hostilities, and "strongly" </p><p>demanding an "immediate" end.  Unusually, the language </p><p>referred to US and UK "power holders" (nha cam quyen) rather </p><p>than "authorities" (chinh quyen) or "governments" (chinh </p><p>phu), a throw-back to Cold War-era language that connotes an </p><p>illegitimate regime.  (An MFA official assured Pol/C on </p><p>March 21, however, that no disrespect or negative </p><p>connotation was intended, merely an effort to point to a few </p><p>decision-makers, rather than the entire Administration.) </p><p>Foreign Minister Nguyen Dy Nien, the only other senior </p><p>official quoted in the press, similarly referred to military </p><p>action as a "bad precedent" that will "harm peace, security, </p><p>and all aspects of political and economic life the world </p><p>over."  A Voice of Vietnam commentary on March 20 predicted </p><p>that "cruelty and destruction" in this war could kill as </p><p>many as four million people, and claimed that the US purpose </p><p>was first to seize control of Iraq\'s oil fields and </p><p>eventually become "master of the world." </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  The MFA spokeswoman nonetheless pledged on March 20 </p><p>that Vietnam had taken "all necessary measures to ensure the </p><p>security of our people, foreign diplomatic facilities and </p><p>foreigners in Vietnam" and promised that Vietnam would </p><p>remain a "truly safe destination."  She also confirmed that </p><p>no Vietnamese remained in Iraq, with about 20 officials, </p><p>families, students, and workers having already departed. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  Security coverage at the Chancery and Rose Garden </p><p>annex remained good.  Police responded quickly to another </p><p>student protest (apparently, a mix of high school and </p><p>university age) at the Chancery in mid-afternoon on March </p><p>20.  This one was louder than previous ones.  At one point, </p><p>a brick was thrown and hit the front of the Embassy, but </p><p>there were no other negative aspects.   An expected </p><p>demonstration at the Australian Embassy apparently did not </p><p>take place. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  Similar to cancellations of meetings with GVN and </p><p>CPV officials on March 20 (ref a), a senior official of the </p><p>Office of Government unexpectedly canceled a March 21 </p><p>meeting with Econ/C, claiming a sudden meeting on Iraq </p><p>chaired by the Prime Minister.  His office later declined to </p><p>reschedule during the week of March 24.  However, the MFA </p><p>Americas Department deputy director met with Pol/C on March </p><p>21 at our request to deliver a demarche on Iraq (ref a and </p><p>septel). </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  CONS issued Department-approved warden message on </p><p>March 20.  No Amcits have called to express concern for </p><p>their safety or offer opinions on the war, although numerous </p><p>Vietnamese have asked whether the Consular Section would </p><p>continue to issue visas.  (Yes.)  There has been a marked </p><p>increase in Amcit registrations, but it is not possible to </p><p>determine whether this was due to the worldwide caution or </p><p>to a different series of warden messages on the SARS </p><p>outbreak. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p></p></div>
