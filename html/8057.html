<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 000936 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR AF/S RAYNOR, CA/OCS/ACS/AF HOFFSTATTER, CA/P PATT, </p><p>AF/PDPA DALTON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, PHUM </p><p>SUBJECT: IMMIGRATION TROUBLE FOR RESIDENT AMCIT JOURNALIST </p><p>ANDREW MELDRUM </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) 2002 HARARE 1446  B) 2002 HARARE 1643 </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>BACKGROUND </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  Andrew Meldrum is an American citizen with Zimbabwean </p><p>permanent residency status.  He is also the Harare </p><p>correspondent for the Guardian newspaper (UK).  He was </p><p>charged by Zimbabwe Republic Police in May 2002 (Ref A) for </p><p>"publishing falsehoods" under Zimbabwe\'s controversial </p><p>"Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act" </p><p>(AIPPA), but was subsequently cleared of that charge after </p><p>a trial in July 2002 (Ref B).  The GOZ responded to </p><p>Meldrum\'s acquittal by slapping him with a deportation </p><p>order within minutes of the announcement of the "not </p><p>guilty" verdict.  However, Meldrum\'s attorney successfully </p><p>appealed the deportation order in Zimbabwe\'s High Court. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>CURRENT SITUATION </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  During the evening of May 7, several men approached </p><p>Meldrum\'s Harare home claiming to be Government of Zimbabwe </p><p>immigration officials.  The men refused to show </p><p>identification to Meldrum\'s wife or his lawyer and would </p><p>not state the purpose of their inquiry.  Meldrum was not at </p><p>home, so the unidentified officials demanded that he </p><p>present himself at the immigration offices the following </p><p>day.  Meldrum refused to comply with this request until he </p><p>or his lawyer was informed about why immigration wanted to </p><p>see him.  He has been staying with friends and keeping a </p><p>low profile until the situation can be resolved. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Two Guardian newspaper executives (British citizens) </p><p>traveled to Zimbabwe on May 9 to assist Meldrum in </p><p>resolving his standoff with Zimbabwean immigration.  Both </p><p>men were given 30-day visas at the Harare airport, but </p><p>later in the day were told by immigration officials that </p><p>their visas had been revoked and that they had 24 hours to </p><p>leave the country. Immigration alleged that the Guardian </p><p>executives had incorrectly filled in their immigration </p><p>forms and had failed to seek advance permission from </p><p>Zimbabwe\'s Minister of Home Affairs for "entering the </p><p>country to discuss a sensitive issue." </p><p> </p><p>4. Meldrum\'s attorney, Beatrice Mtetwa, secured an </p><p>interview with Zimbabwe\'s Chief Immigration Officer, Mr. </p><p>Mgwabi, on Monday May 12.  Mgwabi claimed that Meldrum\'s </p><p>High Court order (granted in 2002) allowing him to remain </p><p>in Zimbabwe as a permanent resident had expired, as Meldrum </p><p>failed to file a further appeal with the Supreme Court of </p><p>Zimbabwe.  Mtetwa was however able to convince Mgwabi that </p><p>it was in fact incumbent upon the GOZ to file an appeal </p><p>with the Supreme Court if they so desired, as the High </p><p>Court had ruled in Meldrum\'s favor.  After the interview, </p><p>the Chief Immigration Officer did agree with Mtetwa that </p><p>the High Court order (granting Meldrum continued permanent </p><p>residency) remained in place indefinitely.  However, he </p><p>insisted that Meldrum come to immigration on May 13th to </p><p>meet with another immigration official named Siziba. </p><p> </p><p>5.  Meldrum reported to immigration as instructed on May </p><p>13th, accompanied by his attorney and conoff.  Senior </p><p>immigration officer Siziba refused to allow conoff to </p><p>participate in the interview.  Siziba and another colleague </p><p>first lectured Meldrum about the GOZ\'s displeasure with the </p><p>type of stories he is writing about Zimbabwe, complaining </p><p>that he portrays the country and its government in a </p><p>negative light.  Siziba then questioned Meldrum about his </p><p>original application for permanent residency, filed in </p><p>1988, claiming that he misrepresented his profession. </p><p>Though all of the forms indicate that Meldrum was (and is) </p><p>a journalist, Siziba claims that he is now acting as a </p><p>"political correspondent" and that such activity is not </p><p>allowed under his residency permit.  Siziba kept Meldrum\'s </p><p>passport and his residency card, and instructed him to </p><p>return to immigration on May 14 with a letter further </p><p>explaining his current occupation. </p><p> </p><p>6.  Ms. Mtetwa, Meldrum\'s lawyer, plans to return to </p><p>Immigration today (May 14) to submit the letter as </p><p>requested.  Post will inform Department of further </p><p>developments as they unfold. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  Andrew Meldrum is the only foreign journalist remaining </p><p>in Zimbabwe, and his harassment by GOZ immigration </p><p>officials is part of a clear pattern of actions aimed at </p><p>silencing critical coverage of events here.  In 2001, the </p><p>GOZ began its campaign to expel all foreign journalists.  A </p><p>BBC correspondent (Jonathan Winter) and an Uruguayan </p><p>freelancer (Mercedes Sayagues) were the first to go, after </p><p>each being visited in the middle of the night by state </p><p>security agents and given less than 48 hours to leave the </p><p>country.  In 2002, Griffin Shea, an American citizen </p><p>working for AFP, was denied renewal of his work permit and </p><p>also forced to leave.  If the GOZ is now able to force </p><p>Meldrum out, it will a serious blow to what remains of </p><p>press freedom in Zimbabwe. </p><p> </p><p>WHITEHEAD </p><p></p></div>
