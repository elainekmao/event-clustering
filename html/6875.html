<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 03 AMMAN 001864 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/26/2013 </p><p>TAGS: AEMR, AMGT, ASEC, CASC, CVIS, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZO1: AMMAN SITREP 15 (3/27 1800 LOCAL) </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. (A) AMMAN 1835 </p><p>     B. (B) FBIS GMP2003026000151 </p><p>     C. (C) AMMAN 1801 </p><p>     D. (D) AMMAN 1744 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Acting DCM Doug Silliman. Reason 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>General Overview </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  Embassy EAC met March 27 to discuss security </p><p>measures in anticipation of significant protest activity </p><p>after Friday prayers on March 28.  EAC issued a "standfast" </p><p>order for all non-emergency personnel for 3/28 until 1800. </p><p>After 1800, unless notified differently, post posture will </p><p>return to allowing American personnel essential movements, to </p><p>include travel to the Embassy and stops for necessary </p><p>supplies.  The EAC will reassess the local security </p><p>environment following the weekend. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) In a postscript to the expulsion of Iraqi diplomats </p><p>from Jordan for security reasons earlier in the week, and the </p><p>GOI\'s verbal attacks against the GOJ for doing so (ref A), </p><p>the official Petra New Agency quoted the Iraqi Ambassador to </p><p>Jordan Sabah Yasin as characterizing the entire affair as "no </p><p>more than a passing summer cloud."  In an meeting with GOJ </p><p>Minister of Industry and Trade Salah Bashir, the Iraqi </p><p>Ambassador indicated that the three expelled Iraqi diplomats </p><p>will be replaced "as soon as possible." (ref B) </p><p> </p><p>3. (S/NF) Privately, GOJ security officials have confirmed </p><p>rumors that a fire set at the Amman Hyatt Hotel on March 22 </p><p>was set by IIS sabateours. (ref C) </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU)  Approximately 7,000 people attended funerals in the </p><p>northern Jordanian city of Ramtha (near Irbid) for the </p><p>Jordanian students killed in Mosul March 23 (ref D).  As of </p><p>1800, PSD had not reported any disturbances associated with </p><p>the funerary march. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU)  About 1,000 anti-U.S., but pro-government, </p><p>protesters held a demonstration at Jordan University March </p><p>27.  PSD notes that the demonstration was peaceful. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>Consular Issues </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (U)  No new issues. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>GOJ Actions/Statements </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (U)  Planning Minister Bassam Awadullah welcomed the </p><p>Ambassador\'s announcement of the President\'s proposed $1.1 </p><p>billion supplemental aid package for Jordan.  Awadullah said </p><p>the aid would "help mitigate the impact of war and make sure </p><p>that Jordan\'s success story is not jeopardized."  He noted </p><p>the international community recognized that allowing the </p><p>Jordanian economic model to fail would have negative </p><p>consequences for U.S. and European development plans for the </p><p>rest of the region.  Awadullah expressed confidence that the </p><p>EU would soon increase its aid to Jordan along similar lines. </p><p> </p><p>8. (U)  The official Petra news service reported (ref B) that </p><p>GOJ Industry and Trade Minister Bashir telephoned Iraqi Trade </p><p>Minister Muhammed Mahdi Salih 3/26 and "emphasized the deep </p><p>relations between the two brotherly countries."  The report </p><p>stated that Bashir told Salih that he would work with the </p><p>Iraqi Ambassador in Jordan to find "mechanisms that would </p><p>facilitate and expedite the constant flow of goods to Iraq . </p><p>. . and emphasized that issues regarding transportation, </p><p>rapid and smooth flow of goods, and alternatives determined </p><p>by priorities in order to meet humanitarian needs in Iraq </p><p>will be studied." </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>Security </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) The GID and PSD will deploy additional security </p><p>personnel overnight around the Embassy, ancillary USG </p><p>facilities, and neighborhoods where Embassy housing is </p><p>located, as part of the GOJ\'s overall preparations for </p><p>possible 3/28 post-prayers demonstrations.  As noted para 1, </p><p>Embassy will implement a standfast order for American </p><p>employees until 1800 on Friday. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>Economic and Trade Developments </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (C)  Port activity:  QIZ exporters reported rumors that </p><p>container ships have been delayed coming into Aqaba. </p><p>Shipping Agents Association Chairman Dalabieh confirms that </p><p>inbound freight has experienced slight delays over the past </p><p>48 hours, but attributes the delay to inclement weather and </p><p>to an inoperable gantry crane at the port, which delayed </p><p>berthing and offloading, respectively.  Dalabieh said inbound </p><p>cargo should resume as normal starting March 27. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (sbu) Internet companies report a sharp upsurge in </p><p>internet use, particularly email traffic, over the last week </p><p>(septel).  The technical support director at the largest </p><p>internet provider in Jordan said that sophisticated software </p><p>is allowing users to access and download tv news reports, </p><p>which are then given broad circulation via email.  Despite an </p><p>increase in traffic that has at times reached 95% capacity, </p><p>providers report no problems with continued service. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (sbu) Similarly, mobile provider MobileCom said that </p><p>levels of text messaging (or SMS) traffic are also on the </p><p>rise, as much as twice the normal level at times. Stephane </p><p>Boudier, Chief Technical Officer for  MobileCom said there </p><p>was "no strain" on the system.  He added, however, that the </p><p>company was getting a "steadily rising" number of complaints </p><p>about inability to connect to land lines in Iraq, a problem </p><p>the company is attributing to degradation of the Iraqi </p><p>telecom infrastructure due to the conflict. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (sbu) Trading on the Amman Stock Exchange was flat </p><p>Thursday, the index up .08%. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (sbu) Target Corporation continues to book orders </p><p>through Jordanian QIZs and said they have no plans to </p><p>discontinue unless events on the ground change.  The company </p><p>gave this reassurance despite an increase in fuel charge per </p><p>kilo from five cents to twenty cents for the Middle East </p><p>imposed March 24.  Target officials said that a shortage of </p><p>aircraft due to military action and a decrease in passenger </p><p>travel added to the increased transportation costs. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>Refugee/Humanitarian Issues </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>15. (U) UNHCR & IOM report that the Jordan-Iraq border </p><p>remains open.  Seven TCNs entered Jordan from Iraq overnight </p><p>(March 26-27) but there have been no TCN arrivals since 1:00 </p><p>am.  There are currently 173 TCNs in the transit camp.  Still </p><p>no sign of any Iraqi refugees/asylum seekers. </p><p> </p><p>16.  (U) Weather conditions improved considerably March 27, </p><p>allowing IOM to resume its repatriation operations.  Four </p><p>Somalis left the camp and another six are scheduled to leave </p><p>on March 28.  Some Sudanese & Somali nationals have told IOM </p><p>officials they do not want to return home.  UNHCR officials </p><p>currently are interviewing these individuals. </p><p> </p><p>17.  (C) MSF/Amman has not received any news from its </p><p>two-truck convoy that crossed from Jordan into Iraq on March </p><p>26.  Separately, the French Embassy in Amman told UNHCR </p><p>officials that it has heard that the Amman-Baghdad highway </p><p>has been "cut" by coalition forces 80 km west of Baghdad. </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>Press </p><p>----- </p><p>18. (SBU)  Banner headlines in all Jordanian dailies March 27 </p><p>highlighted developments in the war.  Lead reports focus on </p><p>the bombing of a marketplace in Baghdad and continued battles </p><p>in southern Iraq.  Other major stories highlight remarks by </p><p>Iraq\'s Ambassador to Jordan that the recent diplomatic "tiff" </p><p>between the countries was a "tempest in a teapot," and that </p><p>bilateral relations remain normal.  Editorials continue to </p><p>criticize the war in the strongest terms, to express </p><p>admiration for Iraqi resistance, and to voice outrage over </p><p>civilian casualties. </p><p> </p><p>19.  (U)  The Ambassador\'s announcement of the President\'s </p><p>request for $1.1 billion in supplemental aid for Jordan </p><p>appeared on the front pages and in the economic pages of all </p><p>Jordanian dailies March 27.  One local commentator noted that </p><p>"Western assistance to Jordan reflects sensitivity to the </p><p>losses suffered by the economy due to war." </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
