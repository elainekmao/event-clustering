<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 ADANA 0066 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EUR/SE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PINS, PHUM, TU, OSCE, ADANA </p><p>SUBJECT:  THE VIEW FROM THE SOUTHEAST, </p><p>ERDOGAN SET TO WIN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF:  ANKARA 1410 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Summary: Reftel reported the view from Ankara </p><p>that AK Party and its leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan </p><p>seems poised to win March 9 special election in </p><p>Siirt.  Indications from our contacts in </p><p>predominantly Kurdish southeastern Turkey also </p><p>point to a comfortable victory for Erdogan and </p><p>AK. There are three seats at stake in Siirt. </p><p>While AK officials in Siirt naturally predict a </p><p>clean sweep, CHP representatives there hope to </p><p>win one, or at most two seats.  The province\'s </p><p>most popular party, DEHAP, is furious at not </p><p>being allowed to contest the election; acting </p><p>apparently on instructions from headquarters, </p><p>local DEHAP supporters are being informally urged </p><p>to boycott or spoil their ballots.  Widespread </p><p>anxiety among Siirt Kurds about war in Northern </p><p>Iraq and possible Turkish military involvement </p><p>there does not seem to be pushing voters toward </p><p>CHP in sufficient numbers to offset AK\'s </p><p>advantage.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1) Consulate Adana poloff toured Siirt Province </p><p>March 4-5 to gauge trends prior to the March 9 </p><p>parliamentary by-election.  Siirt province likely </p><p>has 80,000 voters. (Note: Like most other SE </p><p>Turkey provinces, Siirt is almost entirely made </p><p>up of ethnic Kurds, with the exception of small </p><p>pockets of Turks sent to work for the Government </p><p>and Turkish traders of Arab origin. Endnote.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2) In all locals, (note:  We toured the </p><p>provincial capital, Siirt (est. population </p><p>100,000), and three smaller townships, Kurtalan </p><p>(est. pop. 30,000), and Baykan (est. pop. 12,000) </p><p>End Note.) in proportion to their size, the </p><p>normal election-campaign apparatus and </p><p>apparatchiks were on display: banners, pennants, </p><p>posters, the occasional deputy or minister from </p><p>Ankara shaking hands, and campaign buses cruising </p><p>the streets blaring a mixture of slogans and </p><p>music.  We are unaware of any opinion polling </p><p>going on in the province prior to the election. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>AK Predicting a Landslide </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3) In conversations with AK Party officials at </p><p>all locations, we found them almost giddy with a </p><p>sense of imminent triumph.  They are not going to </p><p>be satisfied with a 3-0 sweep over their only </p><p>serious rival, CHP.  Rather, we repeatedly heard </p><p>the figure of eighty percent as their predicted </p><p>vote total.  AK Party headquarters in all </p><p>locations gave an impression of being hectic and </p><p>chaotic, but flush with resources, including </p><p>plenty of campaign workers. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4) It appears AK Party has indeed been applying </p><p>its advantage as the party of government. </p><p>Although we heard from AK Party officials about </p><p>effective government, from other party officials </p><p>and from random citizens we heard anecdotal </p><p>evidence of how AK has been focusing resources on </p><p>Siirt in the run-up to the election.  For </p><p>example, an isolated hamlet might finally get its </p><p>road or its electricity repaired after many years </p><p>of waiting. (Note:  Road repair crews were in </p><p>evidence as we drove around several towns.) </p><p>Similar promises for future delivery of services </p><p>are allegedly being made widely.  In Eruh, one </p><p>citizen said he had heard of (but not seen), </p><p>voters being bought - for as little as 50 million </p><p>Turkish Lira (approx USD 30). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5) AK Party officials and supporters seemed </p><p>unconcerned that the party and Erdogan </p><p>specifically would pay a price at the ballot box </p><p>in Siirt because of the government\'s, and </p><p>Erdogan\'s, support of the defeated resolution </p><p>concerning US troops coming to Turkey and Turkish </p><p>troops in northern Iraq.  As one party official </p><p>somewhat disingenuously explained, "Mr. Erdogan </p><p>is not in the parliament, so the responsibility </p><p>cannot be assigned to him." Besides, he said, </p><p>lots of AK deputies voted against the resolution </p><p>anyway. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.)  One final factor that gives comfort to AK in </p><p>Siirt is the depth of religiosity in the </p><p>province. (Note:  In Ottoman times Siirt was </p><p>known for its holy men and shrines honoring them </p><p>are unusually common.End note) The religious vote </p><p>in Siirt will go for AK, to spite the secular </p><p>CHP. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>CHP Gamely Hanging in There </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7).  In all CHP headquarters we visited, </p><p>officials described a frustrating two-front </p><p>battle.  Firstly, they had to find a way to </p><p>appeal to voters through ideas rather than </p><p>through instant or promised "pork, " which is the </p><p>prerogative of the party in power. Secondly, they </p><p>seemed to be getting nowhere in their personally- </p><p>made pleas to their DEHAP counterparts to vent </p><p>protest via a CHP vote rather than abstention. </p><p>The CHP in Siirt, based on their dealings with </p><p>DEHAP there, believe DEHAP\'s boycott instructions </p><p>came from the top, not spontaneously from its </p><p>Siirt supporters. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8)  CHP believes that the popularity of the anti- </p><p>war and anti-US-troops-in-Turkey stance of the </p><p>party and CHP Chairman Deniz Baykal in particular </p><p>is helping - but not enough.  It would seem </p><p>perhaps logical that Kurdish voters might reward </p><p>the CHP and punish AK, as it was the AK cabinet </p><p>that proposed allowing US troops to come to </p><p>Turkey and Turkish troops to go into northern </p><p>Iraq.  However, as one frustrated CHP official </p><p>put it, "DEHAP wants to punish everybody." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9) No CHP official or supporter in Siirt told us </p><p>that the party would be shut out, nor that it </p><p>would take all three seats.  One seat, or two, if </p><p>turnout was high in Siirt City, was their </p><p>refrain. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>DEHAP: Anger at an Anti-Democratic Election </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10) Not surprisingly, without exception DEHAP </p><p>members and supporters rejected the upcoming </p><p>March 9 election as illegitimate and </p><p>undemocratic.  Noting that DEHAP was easily the </p><p>major party in the province, why was it being </p><p>blocked from participating this time, they </p><p>wondered. This was particularly galling, they </p><p>noted, in light of the fact that two, completely </p><p>insignificant parties - the Workers Party and the </p><p>Communist Party - had been allowed to run this </p><p>time, and were doing so.  (Note:  While the </p><p>Communist Party is all but invisible in Siirt </p><p>right now, the Workers Party has managed to put </p><p>up posters and run some campaign buses; their </p><p>slogan is "No to American Soldiers!" End note.). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11) DEHAP people in Siirt do not feel warm </p><p>towards AK Party.  Their demands have not found </p><p>resonance with this government, and in Siirt they </p><p>are still waiting for the State to get off their </p><p>back, i.e., put Kurdish language liberalization </p><p>into practice, facilitate village returns, end </p><p>the enforced isolation of Abdullah Ocalan, and in </p><p>general, as one interlocutor put it, "stop </p><p>treating us like animals."  Although DEHAP </p><p>officials acknowledged the logic of expressing </p><p>disappointment with AK by casting votes for CHP, </p><p>they said that a boycott and spoiled-vote </p><p>strategy was preferable.  The need to highlight </p><p>the anti-democratic nature of this election - and </p><p>of Turkish politics writ large - was the </p><p>overriding objective. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12) When asked to predict the likely outcome of </p><p>the election in any case, most DEHAP members </p><p>handicapped it as a likely 2-1 outcome, with </p><p>either AK or CHP on top. </p><p>HOLTZ </p><p></p></div>
