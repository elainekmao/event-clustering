SEEKING TO AVOID DISCUSSION OF GREEK </p><p>ORTHODOX PROTESTS THAT HAVE MARRED THE TRIP\'S PREPARATIONS, </p><p>NAVARRO-VALLS HIGHLIGHTED THAT THE POPE WILL MAKE THREE </p><p>JOINT APPEARANCES WITH THE GREEK ORTHODOX METROPOLITAN </p><p>CHRISTODOULOS OF ATHENS, INCLUDING AN "HISTORIC" READING OF </p><p>THE TEXT OF ST. PAUL AT THE AREOPAGUS.  ALTHOUGH THE VISIT </p><p>IS UNLIKELY TO PRODUCE ANY "GREAT AGREEMENTS," THE SPOKESMAN </p><p>SAID THAT THERE WAS HOPE THAT THE SYMBOLIC GESTURES BETWEEN </p><p>THE TWO RELIGIOUS LEADERS COULD HELP TO OVERCOME SUSPICIONS </p><p>AND MISUNDERSTANDINGS.  HE ALSO POINTED OUT THAT THE POPE </p><p>HAS VISITED GREECE BEFORE, WHILE SERVING AS ARCHBISHOP TO </p><p>KRAKOW. IN A HIGHLY UNUSUAL STEP, INDICATIVE OF THE </p><p>VATICAN\'S EFFORT TO MAINTAIN FOCUS ON THE POSITIVE ASPECTS </p><p>OF THE TRIP, THE VATICAN PRESS OFFICE PUBLISHED A TRANSCRIPT </p><p>OF THE INTERVIEW. IN A CONVERSATION WITH CHARGE ON OTHER </p><p>ISSUES 05/04, VATICAN DFM MIGLIORE SHARED THE HOLY SEE\'S </p><p>"HURT" AT THE VITRIOL DIRECTED AT THE PERSON OF THE POPE BY </p><p>CERTAIN RADICAL QUARTERS OF THE GREEK ORTHODOX CHURCH - IN </p><p>SOME CASES DEMONIZING HIM FOR THE SCHISM OF 1054. IN </p><p>MIGLIORE\'S WORDS, THIS WAS NOT "CIVILIZED" BEHAVIOR. HE </p><p>AVERRED HOWEVER THAT THE VISIT WOULD IN THE END BE A </p><p>SUCCESS. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>PUERTO RICAN BEATIFIED IN RECORD TIME </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.

CARLOS MANUEL </p><p>CECILIO RODRIGUEZ SANTIAGO, WHO DIED IN 1963, IS THE FIRST </p><p>PUERTO RICAN AND FIRST LAY AMCIT TO BE DECLARED "BLESSED." </p><p>KNOWN AFFECTIONATELY AS "CHARLIE", RODRIGUEZ SANTIAGO WORKED </p><p>IN THE CATHOLIC UNIVERSITY CENTER OF THE UNIVERSITY OF </p><p>PUERTO RICO. HIS PROCESS OF BEATIFICATION WAS ONE OF THE </p><p>SHORTEST IN RECENT HISTORY, LASTING ONLY NINE YEARS. (NOTE: </p><p>THE VATICAN TREATS PUERTO RICO AS A SEPARATE ECCLESIASTICAL </p><p>JURISDICTION FROM THE UNITED STATES WITH ITS OWN BISHOPS </p><p>CONFERENCE. THE NUNCIO IN THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC, AMCIT </p><p>ARCHBISHOP TIMOTHY BROGLIO ALSO ACTS AS THE PAPAL </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE TO PUERTO RICO, BUT ONLY FOR SPECIFICALLY </p><p>ECCLESIASTICAL MATTERS. POST FURTHER NOTES THAT AN OFFICIAL </p><p>DELEGATION FROM THE GOVERNMENT OF THE COMMONWEALTH OF PUERTO </p><p>RICO, HEADED BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE ATTENDED THE </p><p>BEATIFICATION.
