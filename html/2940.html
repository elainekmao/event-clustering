<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 000937 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: CVIS, KFRD, PGOV, NP </p><p>SUBJECT: NIV FRAUD RING DUPES WORKERS SEEKING US </p><p>EMPLOYMENT </p><p> </p><p>1.   SUMMARY:  Post uncovered information about a ring of </p><p>con artists claiming to provide nonimmigrant visas for </p><p>approximately 6500 USD when Gobin Karki, a victim of the </p><p>scheme, appeared at the Embassy to collect the visa for </p><p>which he believed he had paid. The ring, with possible </p><p>ties to Darjeeling, uses an elaborate ruse including </p><p>invocation of the name of the current Nepali </p><p>representative to the United Nations to win the </p><p>confidence of laborers looking for overseas employment. </p><p>No fraudulent visa was actually handed over by the </p><p>perpetrators, and the photocopied foil shown to Karki is </p><p>unsophisticated and easily detectable as a forgery.  Post </p><p>is working with Nepal Police to investigate the case, and </p><p>has secured Karki\'s cooperation for eventual prosecution </p><p>of the organizers of the ring.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.   On May 10, Gobin Karki (DPOB 27 February 1971, </p><p>Nepal) appeared at the Embassy to check on the status of </p><p>a visa he claimed to have been issued.  Presenting a </p><p>photocopy of the visa foil as "proof" of the issuance, he </p><p>requested return of his passport.  FSNs easily detected </p><p>that the photocopy was a badly done forgery and brought </p><p>the case to the attention of ConOff.  Mixed typefaces, </p><p>obviously altered MRV code and a control number that does </p><p>not match the issue date are the most obvious problems, </p><p>and further investigation revealed that the foil number </p><p>(20482105) was originally issued to Mohan Shyam Shrestha </p><p>in January 1999.  During further interview with ConOff, </p><p>Karki indicated that he had paid 500,000 Nepali rupees </p><p>(approximately 6500 USD) for a job in and visa to the </p><p>United States. </p><p> </p><p>3.   Having just returned from work in the Gulf, Karki </p><p>mentioned in a conversation with his sister\'s landlord, </p><p>Ram Krishna Shrestha, that he was eager to find </p><p>additional work overseas.  Shrestha stated that he knew a </p><p>friend who could help and put Karki in touch with Arjun </p><p>Khatri, the apparent ringleader.  Khatri won Karki\'s </p><p>confidence by stating that he worked with Murari Raj </p><p>Sharma, former Secretary of Foreign Affairs, and by </p><p>showing him photocopies of three U.S. visas he had </p><p>supposedly helped to obtain for former clients.  (Note: </p><p>Murari Raj Sharma was former Secretary at the MFA and is </p><p>currently Nepal\'s Representative to the U.N.  Karki never </p><p>had any direct interaction with Sharma, and post assumes </p><p>that the con artists are simply using Sharma\'s name </p><p>without his knowledge.) </p><p> </p><p>4.   Khatri stated that he could arrange German visas for </p><p>himself, Shrestha and Karki to work in Europe, and </p><p>collected a total of 340,000 NRs (approximately 4400 USD) </p><p>from Karki, half for Karki\'s own visa and half as a loan </p><p>for Shrestha\'s.  When Khatri came back from Delhi with </p><p>Cuban visas instead of German, he told Karki that they </p><p>would have to get additional stamps from the French </p><p>Embassy in order to travel, and that an easier course </p><p>would be to apply at the U.S. Embassy. He told Karki that </p><p>the 340,000 NRs could be applied to his new application </p><p>with the U.S., and that he would have to pay an </p><p>additional 164,000 (approximately 2100 USD) in order to </p><p>claim the visa once issued.  A few days later, after </p><p>Karki was shown a photocopy of the forgery, he deposited </p><p>the money in a bank account registered to Purushottam </p><p>Guragai and Rajendra Shivakoti, who Karki states are </p><p>travel agents.  According to Karki, he finally became </p><p>suspicious when Khatri failed to produce either his </p><p>passport or the actual visa, and he came to the Embassy </p><p>himself to investigate. </p><p> </p><p>5.   Karki\'s original plan was to go to Darjeeling </p><p>himself to track down Khatri, whom he believes may have </p><p>fled there to live with a second wife, and to file a </p><p>complaint with the police station in his home district of </p><p>Jhapa.  On the suggestion of ConOff, however, he has </p><p>decided to cooperate with the Embassy in prosecuting the </p><p>case through Kathmandu police.  Post believes that </p><p>investigation and prosecution of the case will proceed </p><p>more quickly with Embassy backing.  Karki will also file </p><p>a complaint with the Labor Ministry, as he was promised a </p><p>job by Khatri and the Labor Ministry has jurisdiction </p><p>over persons providing overseas employment. </p><p> </p><p>6.   Post will provide Kathmandu police with all </p><p>information pertaining to the crime, including </p><p>information about the original recipient of the visa </p><p>foil, and our RSO local investigator will accompany Karki </p><p>when he makes his statement to police. </p><p> </p><p>7. Comment:  Though the fraud involved in this scheme is </p><p>relatively unsophisticated and presents little or no </p><p>danger of malafide travelers reaching the U.S., the ease </p><p>with which Karki was duped and the amount of money he was </p><p>willing to pay help to demonstrate the growing </p><p>desperation among some of Nepal\'s working class.  Post </p><p>has already seen an increase in simple fraud at </p><p>interviews and, as unemployment continues to increase, </p><p>expects to see additional attempts like this one to take </p><p>advantage of nave Nepalis seeking higher income in the </p><p>United States. </p><p></p></div>
