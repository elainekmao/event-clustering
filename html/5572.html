THE IRAQI </p><p>INTEREST SECTION IN ROME HAD ALREADY CALLED THE MFA SEEKING </p><p>OFFICIAL GOI APPOINTMENTS, SAID RAGAGLINI, AND THE GOI\'S </p><p>INITIAL THOUGHT WAS TO HAVE AZIZ MEET WITH FM FRATTINI IN </p><p>ORDER TO SEND THE STRONGEST POSSIBLE MESSAGE ON IRAQ TO AZIZ </p><p>IN PERSON AND SUBSEQUENTLY IN A COMMUNIQUE.  RAGAGLINI ALSO </p><p>MENTIONED THAT AZIZ WOULD CERTAINLY SEEK TO MEET OPPOSITION </p><p>LEADERS WHO ARE AGAINST THE WAR AS WELL AS SOME CATHOLIC </p><p>POLITICIANS WITHIN THE GOVERNING COALITION WITH WHOM HE HAS </p><p>HAD LONG CONTACTS. </p><p> </p><p>3.
