<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 001162 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/12/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, ELAB, EFIN, PINS, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: STATES\'S INABILITY TO PAY WAGES RAISES </p><p>CONCERN </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter; Reasons 1.5 (b) and </p><p>(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary.  State governments are sounding the alarm </p><p>that they can no longer pay civil service salaries and </p><p>retiree pensions.  When oil prices and revenues were high in </p><p>May 2000, civil servant wages were more than doubled. </p><p>However, federal revenues allocated to the States have </p><p>dropped in tandem with oil price declines, and many States </p><p>complain they are unable to meet their wage bills.  However, </p><p>many observers, including the Central Bank, believe that the </p><p>States\' fiscal irresponsibility is the primary cause of the </p><p>current wage crisis.  Meanwhile, civil servants across the </p><p>country are threatening strikes if the problem is not </p><p>resolved soon.  A civil service strike would be a big blow to </p><p>the Obasanjo Administration.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p>Lower State Revenues Plus Higher Wages Leads to Trouble </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) In May 2000, State wage bills more than doubled when </p><p>President Obasanjo increased the minimum civil service wage </p><p>of both the States and Federal government from N3,500 to </p><p>N7,500/month (USD 64).  For over a year-and-a-half, high </p><p>world oil prices allowed sufficient funds to flow from the </p><p>Federal government to the State capitals.  States did not </p><p>have to juggle priorities to meet higher payroll costs. </p><p>However, since November 2001, lower oil prices and OPEC quota </p><p>cuts have reduced federal allocations to the States by nearly </p><p>one-third.  Monthly allocations to State governments fell </p><p>from N145.5 billion in October 2001 to N116.5 billion in </p><p>November and December 2001 to N100.03 billion in January </p><p>2002. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) As a result, employees and pensioners in many States </p><p>have received little or no compensation since January 2002. </p><p>There is a hiring freeze in most States, and new and existing </p><p>State projects are reportedly being abandoned.  Non-paying </p><p>States include Anambra, Edo, Enugu, Abia, Imo, Bauchi, Borno, </p><p>Benue, Oyo, Ogun, Ekiti, Kaduna, Cross River and Akwa Ibom. </p><p>Ogun State reported that the state wage bill has grown from </p><p>N87 million in 1999 to N520 million in 2002 while pensions </p><p>have grown from N35 million to N125 million in the same </p><p>period.  Ekiti State reported receiving N270 million from the </p><p>federal government in February 2002.  Ekiti\'s monthly wage </p><p>bill is N420 million, including pensions. Kaduna claimed that </p><p>its revenue allocation had dropped by 50 percent, resulting </p><p>in a cut of all new projects. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Central Bank Director for Research, Dr. Joseph Nnanna, </p><p>commented to EmbOff that the problem is "80 percent States\' </p><p>fiscal irresponsibility and 20 percent the fall in federal </p><p>allocations."  Central Bank Governor Sanusi had repeatedly </p><p>warned State Governors to save money when oil prices remained </p><p>high in order to compensate for truncated revenues during </p><p>times of low oil prices.  Too many governors turned a deaf </p><p>ear to Sanusi\'s advice.  Now, without the generous cash flow </p><p>created by liberal oil prices, the Central Bank\'s mid-2001 </p><p>directive prohibiting commercial banks in Nigeria from </p><p>lending to State governments has closed off the most probable </p><p>stop-gap for the governors.  State governments, therefore, </p><p>are hard-pressed to compensate for the shortfall in </p><p>expenditures.  They have to swallow the bitter pill of </p><p>spending cuts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>Labor Unrest </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) States\' inability to pay employee and pensioner wages </p><p>have led to localized strikes in different areas across the </p><p>country.  In Anambra, secondary schools have been closed </p><p>since November 2001 following a strike by teachers over </p><p>nonpayment of salaries amounting to N270 million (USD 2.3 </p><p>million).  These strikes and work stoppages have produced an </p><p>adverse ripple effect in some instances.  In Oyo state, a </p><p>strike by State water corporation workers was accompanied by </p><p>an outbreak of cholera and other water-borne diseases due to </p><p>an acute scarcity of potable water.  In Bauchi, magistrates </p><p>and other judiciary staff issued a two-week ultimatum ending </p><p>April 19 for payment of salaries due since November 2001, </p><p>threatening an indefinite strike if payment is not made. </p><p>There are numerous other examples of strikes by State civil </p><p>servants, even as groups still on the job increasingly </p><p>threaten to walk out. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>States Blame the Federal Government </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) Trying to divert the blame, many State officials and </p><p>national legislators are pointing the finger at President </p><p>Obasanjo.  These groups are saying that the President erred </p><p>by not consulting them prior to his May 2000 announcement </p><p>doubling wages.  Senate Chairman for the Committee on </p><p>Employment, Labor and Productivity Bello Gwarzo opined that </p><p>President Obasanjo should have brought his proposed wage </p><p>increase to the national legislature rather than unilaterally </p><p>declaring the increase.  A bill would have been debated on </p><p>the floor and subject to public hearings during which State </p><p>governments would have had the opportunity to raise their </p><p>concerns.  Instead, after the President made his </p><p>announcement, governors and legislators felt compelled to </p><p>support the increase.  (Comment: These bellows from Gwarzo </p><p>and others are disingenuous.  The National Assembly could </p><p>have debated the wage increase.  However, the increase was </p><p>popular at the time and few, if any, were willing to take a </p><p>public stand against it.  End Comment.) </p><p>7. (U) Accompanying the minimum wage increase in May 2000, </p><p>the entire government wage schedule was revised upwards to </p><p>reflect the increase at the lower end.  Although Federal and </p><p>State government schedules are not directly linked, the </p><p>President\'s announcement of a nation-wide wage increase </p><p>effectively tied the two together.  Therefore, the same </p><p>increase was applied to both a mid-level government employee </p><p>in Bauchi and a mid-level employee in Abuja despite the wide </p><p>disparity in the cost of living.  State officials complain </p><p>that the Federal government, particularly the President, </p><p>should not set nation-wide wage levels, suggesting the </p><p>Federal government only set the national minimum wage, </p><p>allowing States to determine their own salary structures more </p><p>in line with local costs of living.  A corresponding increase </p><p>in employee allowances, which supplement salaries through the </p><p>provision of personal vehicles, housing, furniture, etc., </p><p>unlike the wage increase, were determined on a State-by-State </p><p>basis. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) The National Labor Congress is lobbying hard for a </p><p>promised 25 percent wage increase nation-wide.  The President </p><p>last year pledged to implement the increase in April 2002, </p><p>but this is now unlikely to happen.  State governors argue </p><p>that the 25 percent increase, if adopted, should only apply </p><p>to Federal government workers with a correspondingly lower </p><p>increase applied to State employees. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) The failure to pay civil servants is the most salient </p><p>sign that State budget outlays far exceed revenues.  This is </p><p>partly due to the shrinkage in the allocations from the </p><p>Federation Account.  However, mismanagement and corrupt </p><p>practices are also a heavily contributing factor.  Most </p><p>governors have adequate money if they don\'t misspend on </p><p>massive prestige projects in Abuja, foreign travel and public </p><p>works contracts given to friends and relatives who will be </p><p>expected to finance their re-election campaigns.  But with </p><p>elections less than a year away, governors and State and </p><p>local officials will be prone to divert funds for these </p><p>campaigns and to give contracts to supporters in order to </p><p>bolster their reelection ambitions.  During the period of </p><p>tight money, the States cannot continue "business as usual" </p><p>and also pay their civil servants.  State and local </p><p>governments are the largest employers in most communities. </p><p>Failure to pay civil servants will cripple local economies. </p><p>Moreover, the hiring freeze imposed by some States will </p><p>contribute to unemployment.  Additionally, State-level </p><p>projects, many of which focus on health, education and </p><p>agriculture, have been suspended due to lack of funds and </p><p>thus the scant social services being provided will be further </p><p>reduced in many areas. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) The ripple effect of the States\' financial woes is </p><p>serious and could cause widespread hardship amidst a </p><p>citizenry already struggling to make ends meet. The GON\'s </p><p>recent round of tariff rises will increase the cost of </p><p>staples, such as rice, and therefore heighten misery. While </p><p>fiscal discipline by the states is the first, most important </p><p>step, the Federal government may need to take remedial </p><p>action.  However, there are no clear signals from the States </p><p>as to how they plan to cope nor from the Federal government </p><p>as to how it plans to help.  Recent rises in world oil prices </p><p>may provide some relief to state coffers.  Additionally, the </p><p>GON could consider lending money to the States to see them </p><p>through this dry period, although this is unlikely.  The </p><p>Supreme Court\'s recent decision to prohibit the deduction of </p><p>first line charges before the Federal government remits </p><p>allocations to State and local governments will augment State </p><p>resources, but only minimally (reported septel). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) In a sense, the Federal government has the governors </p><p>on board.  Failure to pay wages could be a blow to a </p><p>governor\'s electoral chances.  Should the Federal government </p><p>help bail out the States, a political price tag likely will </p><p>be attached and President Obasanjo will expect the governors </p><p>to remember, come election time, that he is their creditor. </p><p>If action is not taken and the States continue to miss wage </p><p>payments, the country risks a more generalized civil service </p><p>strike that might not only bring things to a halt but might </p><p>result in significant disorder.  This comes at a time when </p><p>the Nigerian Labor Congress has threatened a national labor </p><p>strike unless the Federal government implements the 25% wage </p><p>increase agreed to last year.  One or both strike actions </p><p>would be a serious blow to the Obasanjo Administration.  End </p><p>Comment. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
