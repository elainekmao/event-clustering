<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 USUN NEW YORK 02987 </p><p>AMMAN FOR RICCIARDONE; LONDON FOR N JOHNSON </p><p>E.0.12356: N/A </p><p> </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PBTS, UNSC, KU, IZ </p><p> </p><p>SUBJECT: IRAQ DECIDES NOT TO PARTICIPATE IN UN BOUNDARY </p><p>- DEMARCATION COMMISSION SESSION </p><p> </p><p>REF: USUN 2977 </p><p> </p><p>1. FOR THE RECORD WE PROVIDE THE FULL TEXT OF THE IRAQI </p><p>FM\'S JULY 12 LETTER (S/24275, FAXED TO IO/UNP), </p><p>SUMMARIZED REFTEL, IN WHICH IRAQ ANNOUNCES THAT IT WILL </p><p>NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE CURRENT SESSION OF THE UN </p><p>BOUNDARY DEMARCATION COMMISSION IN NEW YORK. </p><p> </p><p>2. BEGIN TEXT: </p><p>LETTER DATED 12 JULY 1992 FROM THE MINISTER FOR FOREIGN </p><p>AFFAIRS OF IRAQ ADDRESSED TO THE SECRETARY-GENERAL </p><p>I HAVE THE HONOUR TO INFORM YOU THAT WE HAVE BEEN </p><p>NOTIFIED THAT THE BOUNDARY DEMARCATION COMMISSION HAS </p><p>DECIDED TO HOLD ITS SIXTH SESSION AT NEW YORK BETWEEN 15 </p><p>AND 24 JULY 1992. ON THIS OCCASION, I SHOULD LIKE TO REFER TO THE LETTER </p><p>THAT I ADDRESSED TO YOU ON 21 MAY 1992 CONCERNING THE </p><p>DECISIONS ADOPTED ON 14 APRIL 1992, AT ITS FIFTH </p><p>SESSION, BY THE COMMISSION YOU APPOINTED ON THE MATTER </p><p>OF THE BOUNDARY (S/24044, ANNEX). IN THAT LETTER, I SET </p><p>FORTH IN DETAIL THE VIEWPOINT OF THE GOVERNMENT OF IRAQ </p><p>ON THIS GRAVE MATTER IN VIEW OF ITS VITAL IMPORTANCE TO </p><p>THE INTERESTS OF IRAQ AND OF OTHER REGIONS OF THE WORLD </p><p>THAT EXPERIENCE INTERNATIONAL DISPUTES REGARDING </p><p>BOUNDARIES. IN THAT LETTER, I ELUCIDATED HOW THE </p><p>SECURITY COUNCIL HAD, IN AN UNPRECEDENTED MANNER, </p><p>INTRUDED THE ISSUE OF THE BOUNDARY BETWEEN IRAQ AND </p><p>KUWAIT INTO ITS RESOLUTION 687 (1991) BY IMPOSING ON IT </p><p>A PARTICULAR STATUS, WHILE IT IS UNIVERSALLY ACCEPTED IN </p><p>LAW AND IN PRACTICE AS THEY RELATE TO INTERNATIONAL </p><p>INTERCOURSE THAT BOUNDARY ISSUES ARE LEFT TO AGREEMENT </p><p>BETWEEN STATES BECAUSE THIS IS THE ONLY BASIS CAPABLE OF </p><p>ENSURING THE PRINCIPLE OF BOUNDARY STABILITY. I ALSO </p><p>EXPLAINED HOW CERTAIN VERY VITAL ASPECTS OF THE </p><p>ARRANGEMENTS THAT HAD BEEN MADE BY THE SECRETARY-GENERAL </p><p>OF THE UNITED NATIONS TO ACHIEVE THE OBJECTIVE ENJOINED </p><p>BY THE SECURITY COUNCIL WITH REGARD TO SO-CALLED </p><p>BOUNDARY DEMARCATION DID NOT ENSURE JUSTICE AND FAIRNESS </p><p>BY STRIKING A BALANCE BETWEEN THE POSITIONS OF THE TWO </p><p>PARTIES AND MAINTAINING THEIR EQUALITY. THOSE ASPECTS </p><p>INCLUDED THE WAY THE DEMARCATION COMMISSION WAS FORMED, </p><p>THE MANNER IN WHICH IT UNDERTOOK ITS TECHNICAL WORK, THE </p><p>MANNER IN WHICH IT TOOK DECISIONS, THE NATURE AND </p><p>PURPOSE OF THOSE DECISIONS AND OTHER IMPORTANT MATTERS. </p><p>AS YOU KNOW, IN MY LETTER I ADDRESSED IN DETAIL ONE </p><p>EXAMPLE OF THE MANNER IN WHICH THE COMMISSION REACHED A </p><p>MAJOR DECISION ON A MATTER OF SUBSTANCE CONCERNING THE </p><p>GENERAL COURSE OF THE BOUNDARY LINE ON THE BASIS OF A </p><p>CARTOGRAPHIC VIEWPOINT THAT RELIED FUNDAMENTALLY ON </p><p>BRITISH CORRESPONDENCE AND MAPS GOING BACK TO THE PERIOD </p><p>WHEN BRITAIN WAS THE COLONIAL POWER DOMINATING THE </p><p>REGION. IN THIS CONNECTION, I STATED ALSO HOW THE </p><p>COMMISSION HAD ADOPTED THIS APPROACH AS A GENERAL ONE </p><p>AND THAT, INSTEAD OF EXERCISING PATIENCE IN REACHING </p><p>DECISIONS AND AWAITING THE PRESENTATION OF THE DOCUMENTS </p><p>AND NOTES REFERRED TO BY THE REPRESENTATIVE OF IRAQ, IT </p><p>PREVENTED THAT FROM TAKING PLACE BY ADOPTING SUBSTANTIVE </p><p>AND TECHNICAL DECISIONS WITH NOTABLE HASTE AND DISPATCH </p><p>UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF EVIDENT PRESSURE FROM THE </p><p> </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE OF THE REGIME OF KUWAIT. THE DECISIONS </p><p>WERE THE OUTCOME OF ANSWERS TO LEADING QUESTIONS </p><p>ADDRESSED TO THE TWO EXPERTS WHICH LED TO PROPOSALS </p><p>MERELY FOR THE ANSWER ELICITED WITHOUT REGARD FOR THE </p><p>PROPER LOGIC OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE AND THE </p><p>INTERRELATED CHARACTER OF THE SUBSTANCE OF THE ISSUES </p><p>ADDRESSED. THE COMMISSION THUS ENDED UP ADOPTING </p><p>DECISIONS THAT WERE ONE-SIDED IN RESPECT OF SOURCE AND </p><p>CONTENT. </p><p> </p><p>AS YOU KNOW, I CALLED ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT THE </p><p>COMMISSION HAD ACCORDED THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE REGIME </p><p>OF KUWAIT THE OPPORTUNITY TO RAISE THE QUESTION OF THE </p><p>DEMARCATION OF THE MARITIME BOUNDARY IN THE KHOR </p><p>ABDULLAH DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE COMMISSION\'S MANDATE </p><p>DID NOT EXTEND TO THAT MATTER, IN THE VIEW OF THE TWO </p><p>INDEPENDENT EXPERTS AS SUPPORTED BY THE CHAIRMAN OF THE </p><p>COMMISSION, IN AN OBVIOUS ENDEAVOUR TO SECURE THE </p><p>DESIRES OF THE RULERS OF KUWAIT AT THE EXPENSE OF THE </p><p>HISTORIC RIGHTS OF IRAQ AND ITS VITAL NAVIGATIONAL </p><p>INTERESTS. </p><p> </p><p>I ALSO MADE IT CLEAR TO YOU THAT THE ACTUAL REALITY OF </p><p>THE WORK OF THE COMMISSION IN THE FIELD IS UNEQUIVOCAL </p><p>TESTIMONY TO THE FACT THAT A FUNDAMENTAL DECISION OF THE </p><p>COMMISSION WAS IMPLEMENTED IN A MANNER INCOMPATIBLE WITH </p><p>ITS OWN TENOR BY THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE REGIME OF </p><p>KUWAIT AND HIS EXPERTS PARTICIPATING IN THE WORK ON THE </p><p>GROUND AND THAT THE WORK OF THE COMMISSION HAS NOT BEEN </p><p>SAFE FROM DIRECT INTERVENTION BY THE SECRETARIAT. THUS, </p><p>THE FINAL OUTCOME OF ALL THIS ACTIVITY IS THE ESSENTIAL </p><p>FACT THAT THE MATTER OF DEALING WITH BOUNDARIES WAS </p><p>JUSTIFIED AND SET IN MOTION IN ACCORDANCE WITH A </p><p>PREDETERMINED COURSE SO AS TO CULMINATE IN DECISIONS </p><p>IMPOSED ON IRAQ WITHOUT ANY REGARD FOR ITS INTERESTS AND </p><p>ALL THE EVIDENCE THAT SUPPORTS THEM AND LEAVING NO SCOPE </p><p>FOR JUSTICE AND FAIRNESS TO IRAQ\'S TERRITORIAL INTERESTS </p><p>WE STILL BELIEVE, AS I INDICATED IN MY LETTER, THAT THE </p><p>OUTCOME OF THE COMMISSION\'S WORK IS A PURELY POLITICAL </p><p>DECISION IMPOSED BY THE POWERS THAT TODAY CONTROL THE </p><p>SECURITY COUNCIL AND THE UNITED NATIONS, IN PARTICULAR </p><p>THE GOVERNMENTS OF THE UNITED STATES AND THE UNITED </p><p>KINGDOM. THE POLITICAL OBJECTIVE OF THE DECISION IS </p><p>CLEAR, AND IT IS NOT ONLY TO DEPRIVE IRAQ OF ITS RIGHTS </p><p>AND DAMAGE ITS VITAL INTERESTS BUT ALSO DELIBERATELY TO </p><p>CREATE A PRESENCE OF AMERICAN AND BRITISH ARMED FORCES </p><p>AND MILITARY BASES SO THAT THEY MAY CONTINUE TO </p><p>BLACKMAIL THE EXISTING REGIMES AND TO PLUNDER OIL </p><p>RESOURCES. </p><p>AFTER PROLONGED STUDY OF ALL THE FACTORS AND </p><p>CIRCUMSTANCES, IT IS CLEAR TO US THAT THE VIEWS OF IRAQ </p><p>WILL NOT BE HEARD IN THE COMMISSION AND THAT IT WILL NOT </p><p>PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR A HEARING REGARDLESS OF ANY </p><p>EFFORTS WE MAKE TO CREATE AN OBJECTIVE AND IMPARTIAL </p><p>ATMOSPHERE FOR ITS WORK. THIS IS BECAUSE A PRIOR AND </p><p>BIASED DECISION HAS BEEN TAKEN TO HARM IRAQ\'S INTERESTS </p><p>AND DENY ITS HISTORIC RIGHTS ON THE PART OF THOSE </p><p>COUNTRIES THAT PLANNED THE COMMISSION\'S WORK. AMONG THE </p><p>SALIENT FACTS THAT CONFIRM THIS CONCLUSION IS THAT THE </p><p>SECURITY COUNCIL WAS INFORMED OF THE LETTER WHICH WE </p><p>ADDRESSED TO YOU, AND INSTEAD OF ITS TENOR PROVIDING AN </p><p>INCENTIVE TO CAREFUL CONSIDERATION AND FAIR </p><p>INVESTIGATION, THE COUNTRIES TO WHICH WE HAVE REFERRED </p><p>RESORTED TO INDUCING THE COUNCIL TO ADOPT A STATEMENT BY </p><p>ITS PRESIDENT WHICH CONTAINED ONLY INTERPRETATIONS </p><p>LACKING IN OBJECTIVITY AND THREATS. </p><p>FOR THE REASONS SET FORTH ABOVE, WE FEEL THAT OUR </p><p>PARTICIPATION IN THE MEETING OF THE COMMISSION WOULD BE </p><p>TO NO AVAIL. </p><p>(SIGNED) AHMAD HUSSEIN </p><p>MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS </p><p>OF THE REPUBLIC OF IRAQ </p><p>END TEXT. </p><p> PERKINS </p><p></p></div>
