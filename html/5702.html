<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ZAGREB 000338 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EUR/SCE (NARDI), EUR/PA/PD (HORNBUCKLE) </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/13/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, KPAO, KMDR, HR, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: WITH NO POLITICAL LEADERSHIP, CROATIA\'S POSITION </p><p>ON IRAQ SOFTENING </p><p> </p><p>REF: ZAGREB 326 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: AMBASSADOR LAWRENCE ROSSIN FOR REASON 1.5 (B,D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) ALTHOUGH THE GOC MADE STRONG AND POSITIVE INITIAL </p><p>STATEMENTS AFTER SECRETARY POWELL\'S PRESENTATION TO THE UNSC </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00338  121756Z </p><p>ON FEBRUARY 5, IT HAS DONE LITTLE SINCE THEN TO SHAPE THE </p><p>PUBLIC DEBATE AND NOTHING TO DESCRIBE THE THREAT POSED BY </p><p>SADDAM HUSSEIN\'S WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION.  THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>HAS GIVEN A SERIES OF ON-THE-RECORD INTERVIEWS AND THE </p><p>EMBASSY HAS PRACTICALLY FORCE-FED BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON </p><p>THE THREAT POSED BY IRAQ TO ALL LOCAL MEDIA.  NEVERTHELESS, </p><p>THE DEBATE IN ZAGREB\'S POLITICAL CIRCLES IS NOW FOCUSED </p><p>ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY ON WHETHER OR NOT FM PICULA SHOULD HAVE </p><p>SIGNED THE V-10 STATEMENT AND HOW CROATIA\'S BID FOR EU </p><p>MEMBERSHIP WILL BE AFFECTED BY ITS POSITION ON IRAQ. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) PUBLIC OPINION, IN THE ABSENCE OF ANY DOMESTIC </p><p>POLITICAL LEADERSHIP ON THE ISSUE, IS RUNNING STRONG AGAINST </p><p>MILITARY ACTION IN IRAQ WITHOUT A NEW UNSC RESOLUTION.  A </p><p>FEBRUARY 10 POLL CONDUCTED BY CROATIA\'S MOST RELIABLE AGENCY </p><p>SHOWS THAT MORE THAN 80 PERCENT OF THE PUBLIC IS AGAINST </p><p>MILITARY ACTION.  AT A FEBRUARY 12 PRESS CONFERENCE, PM RACAN </p><p>BACKED AWAY FROM THE V-10 STATEMENT, CALLING IT "IMPRECISE </p><p>AND OPEN TO INTERPRETATION," UNDERSCORING THAT IN SIGNING THE </p><p>STATEMENT, THE GOC UNDERTOOK NO NEW OBLIGATIONS TO SUPPORT </p><p>USG EFFORTS AGAINST IRAQ. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) RACAN SEEKS TO MAKE A CLEAR DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN </p><p>CROATIA\'S COMMITMENT TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE WAR AGAINST </p><p>TERRORISM AND ANY POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTION TO EFFORTS IN IRAQ. </p><p>ON FEBRUARY 11, RACAN REVIEWED THE MP PLATOON WHICH WILL </p><p>DEPLOY TO KABUL IN SUPPORT OF ISAF BY THE END OF FEBRUARY. </p><p>AT THE FEBRUARY 12 PRESS CONFERENCE, HE REITERATED CROATIA\'S </p><p>SUPPORT FOR THE WAR AGAINST TERRORISM.  BUT HE SAID THAT HIS </p><p>GOVERNMENT HAS TAKEN NO DECISIONS ON HOW CROATIA MIGHT </p><p>CONTRIBUTE TO EFFORTS IN IRAQ.  RACAN SAID THAT ANY DECISION </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00338  121756Z </p><p>TO CONTRIBUTE TO MILITARY EFFORTS AGAINST IRAQ WOULD HAVE TO </p><p>BE TAKEN BY THE CABINET, IN ACCORDANCE WITH CROATIA\'S LAWS </p><p>AND CONSTITUTION, AND THEN ONLY AFTER WEIGHING ALL ARGUMENTS, </p><p>INCLUDING PUBLIC OPINION.  "CROATIA ADVOCATES A PEACEFUL </p><p>RESOLUTION," SAID RACAN, AND ADDED THAT THE "POSITION OF THE </p><p>CROATIAN PUBLIC IS UNDERSTANDABLE," GIVEN CROATIA\'S RECENT </p><p>EXPERIENCE IN WAR. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) RACAN -- NOT A DYNAMIC LEADER AT THE BEST OF TIMES -- </p><p>IS TRYING TO KEEP HIS COALITION TOGETHER LONG ENOUGH TO </p><p>SUBMIT CROATIA\'S APPLICATION TO THE EU BEFORE LIMPING TO </p><p>EARLY ELECTIONS (REFTEL).  WE WILL CONTINUE TO URGE CROATIAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS -- AND THE LOCAL PRESS -- TO STAY </p><p>FOCUSED ON THE IMPORTANT ISSUE AT HAND: DISARMING SADDAM </p><p>HUSSEIN.  WITHOUT A CLEAR SIGNAL FROM THE EU OR NATO, RACAN\'S </p><p>GOVERNMENT WILL LIKELY STAY ON THE FENCE. </p><p>ROSSIN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
