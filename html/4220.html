<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 003036 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR C. GURNEY -- PASS TO A/S KANSTEINER AND </p><p>AMB. JETER </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/04/12 </p><p>TAGS: PBTS, MOPS, PGOV, PREL, PREF, EPET, NI, CM </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: MOD DANJUMA ACCUSES FRENCH OF ARMING </p><p>CAMEROON </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA 02933 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER; REASONS 1.5 </p><p>(B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) During a private moment at the October 30 </p><p>Australian National Day, I asked Minister of Defense </p><p>T.Y. Danjuma if he could confirm reports of a GON </p><p>military build-up in response to the ICJ decision on </p><p>the Bakassi.  Danjuma did not deny the reports as I </p><p>thought he would; rather he said that Nigeria\'s recent </p><p>military hardware acquisitions were in response to </p><p>arming of Cameroon by France.  This clandestine French </p><p>program had been going on for 18 months, according to </p><p>Danjuma.  The arms supplied by France, the Minister </p><p>said, included aircraft, amphibious crafts, and </p><p>munitions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) When I reported that the French had denied </p><p>these allegations, Danjuma said that Nigeria was </p><p>certain of its information because the GON had </p><p>intelligence agents in Cameroon who gave eye witness </p><p>accounts of the arms transfers.  Moreover, these </p><p>agents had also reported the presence of French </p><p>military advisors in Cameroon who were working side- </p><p>by-side with the Cameroonian military and training </p><p>them on the use of the new equipment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) COMMENT: Danjuma has a fixation on the French, </p><p>and his certainty of French machinations is </p><p>unshakable.  Whether real or imagined, Danjuma\'s </p><p>perception, likely shared by other senior GON </p><p>officials, is helping to drive current GON military </p><p>acquisitions and policy.
