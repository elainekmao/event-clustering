(U)  AT THE ONGOING SESSION OF THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY, </p><p>GENERAL PROCURATOR HA MANH TRI PUBLICLY CITED SEVERE </p><p>DIFFICULTIES IN DEALING WITH CORRUPTION CASES, CLAIMING A </p><p>"LACK OF ADEQUATE EVIDENCE" DESPITE CLEAR INDICATIONS OF </p><p>"THOUSANDS" OF CORRUPTION CASES.  SUPREME PEOPLE\'S COURT </p><p>PRESIDING JUDGE NGUYEN VAN HIEN, SPEAKING TO PRESS RECENTLY, </p><p>EXPRESSED DISAPPOINTMENT THAT THE "308 CORRUPTION CASES" </p><p>UNDER TRIAL SO FAR OR HAVING BEEN TRIED ALREADY BY THE COURT </p><p>SYSTEM ONLY "REPRESENTED A TINY NUMBER" OF THE TOTAL CASES. </p><p>JUDGE HIEN CALLED FOR ALL LEGAL ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES, </p><p>ESPECIALLY THE PROCURACY AND THE POLICE, TO BE STRICTER IN </p><p>DEALING WITH CORRUPTION CASES, AND TO USE LEGAL REMEDIES </p><p>INSTEAD OF CONTINUING THE CURRENT PRACTICE OF PRIMARILY </p><p>APPLYING ONLY ADMINISTRATIVE PUNISHMENTS AGAINST CORRUPT </p><p>OFFICIALS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  COMMENT:  WITH THESE RECENT ACTIONS AS WELL AS THE </p><p>ONGOING INDICTMENTS AND UPCOMING TRIALS OF AT LEAST 155 </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02913  051026Z </p><p>OFFICIALS INVOLVED IN THE NAM CAM MAFIA/CORRUPTION CASE </p><p>(REFTELS) -- WHICH HAS NOW BEEN POSTPONED UNTIL AT LEAST MID- </p><p>FEBRUARY -- THE GVN IS TRYING TO DEMONSTRATE A WILLINGNESS </p><p>TO COMBAT CORRUPTION AT ALL LEVELS.  DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER </p><p>NGUYEN TAN DUNG, HOWEVER, RECENTLY PUBLICLY DRESSED DOWN A </p><p>SENIOR POLICE OFFICIAL FOR SUGGESTING THAT OFFICIALS ABOVE </p><p>THE DEPUTY MINISTER LEVEL MAY BE INVOLVED IN THE NAM CAM </p><p>CASE AND MIGHT FACE PROSECUTION; THE POLICE OFFICIAL </p><p>SUBSEQUENTLY CLAIMED TO HAVE BEEN MISQUOTED.  PUNISHMENT AND </p><p>PROSECUTIONS OF CORRUPT OFFICIALS ARE WELCOME STEPS, BUT ARE </p><p>UNLIKELY TO BE SUCCESSFUL EITHER IN MAKING GENUINE PROGRESS </p><p>TOWARD ERADICATING OFFICIAL CORRUPTION OR IN CONVINCING THE </p><p>PUBLIC THAT THE GVN IS TRULY SERIOUS IN THIS EFFORT. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p></div>
