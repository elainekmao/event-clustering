<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 002700 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/23/2006 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, KISL, KIRF, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: STONING SENTENCES IN KEBBI, SOKOTO; GON BEGINS </p><p>SHARI\'A LAW REFORM </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) ABUJA 1046 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter, reasons 1.5 (b) and </p><p>(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.(C)  Summary: For a variety of reasons, religious fervor </p><p>has escalated in parts of Northern Nigeria recently.  Shari\'a </p><p>courts in two states have added to the tense atmosphere by </p><p>issuing two sentences of stoning.  A man was sentenced to </p><p>death by stoning in September In Kebbi state after being </p><p>convicted of sodomy on a minor.  That death sentence was </p><p>followed by one issued in Sokoto October 10.  Based upon </p><p>conversations with Governors of both states, it appears </p><p>neither sentence will be carried out.  To bring uniformity </p><p>and to prevent excesses, the FG is currently drafting a model </p><p>Shari\'a criminal code.  The northern governors support for </p><p>the FG\'s efforts which could minimize the harsh judgments </p><p>passed by local Shari\'a judges.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  Regarding the Kebbi sentence, Gov. Aleiro told Poloff </p><p>that the stoning sentence of Attahiru Umar would be </p><p>overturned by a review committee, even though the perpetrator </p><p>did not appeal.  Aleiro even said that he planned to revise </p><p>Kebbi\'s Shari\'a statute to repeal traditional "Hudud" death </p><p>sentences. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.(C)  The Sokoto death sentence is more disturbing: a woman, </p><p>Safiya Hussaini, was convicted of adultery after she was </p><p>turned in by neigbors in her village.  The Alkali judge, </p><p>Muhammed Bello, viewed her pregnancy as conclusive proof of </p><p>adultery, even though procedural requirements for this </p><p>drastic sentence demand four competent witnesses to the act. </p><p>Hussaini accused an elderly man of fathering the child, and </p><p>the man allegedly confessed to three police officials.  The </p><p>Alkali decided three witnesses to the confession were </p><p>inadequate to convict the man, but convicted Hussaini based </p><p>on her marital status (divorced) and the her pregnancy. </p><p>Sokoto Governor Attahiru Bafarawa told Poloff recently that </p><p>there would be no more "extreme" punishments meted out by </p><p>Shari\'a courts in his state.  Bafarawa has also instituted a </p><p>Shari\'a review committee that routinely quashes inhumane </p><p>sentences for procedural or legal irregularities.  This </p><p>should apply with even greater effect to sentences of death </p><p>by stoning.  Helping matters procedurally, Ms. Hussaini has </p><p>appealed her sentence.  The appeal could finally bring the </p><p>constitutionality of "Hudud" punishments, such as stoning and </p><p>amputation, before Nigeria\'s Supreme Court. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  In a meeting with PolCouns and Poloff October 22, </p><p>Political Advisor to the Vice President, Dr. Usman Bugaje, </p><p>described the FG\'s efforts to bring uniformity to the states\' </p><p>Shari\'a statutes.  A committee of Shari\'a legal scholars at </p><p>the Nigerian Institute for Islamic Legal Studies at Ahmadu </p><p>Bello University in Zaria is drafting a model Shari\'a code </p><p>that will eventually be adopted by any state wishing to have </p><p>criminal Shari\'a courts for Muslims.  The proposed law will </p><p>incorporate Shari\'a procedural protections, which most Alkali </p><p>judges currently ignore, according to Bugaje. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  Bugaje said the Committee was meeting with political </p><p>activists who have championed Shari\'a in the various Northern </p><p>states, who siezed this issue to gain power, relevance, and </p><p>perhaps, government jobs.  Bugaje said the Committee needed </p><p>to educate the activists about Shari\'a.  He hoped that this </p><p>education by the scholars would moderate these politicized </p><p>activists, bring them around to support Shari\'a law reforms, </p><p>and a uniform code. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C)  Comment:  The FG\'s efforts to develop a uniform </p><p>Shari\'a code hopefully will help reduce the number of the </p><p>egregious sentences coming out of the states.  (Current state </p><p>laws differ and some are internally inconsistent.)  The GON </p><p>also hopes that the shrillness of Shari\'a proponents will be </p><p>moderated during this protracted drafting process.  However, </p><p>while this process slowly inches forward, the air in many </p><p>areas of Northern Nigeria has been ionized, partly because of </p><p>the increased focus on religion and Shari\'a.  It was perhaps </p><p>a matter of time that some of the more traditional Shari\'a </p><p>courts would reflect a more truculent mood.  Moderate </p><p>northern governors (except Sani of Zamfara) say privately </p><p>that they will prevent the extreme sentences from being </p><p>implemented.  While the governors\' statements are somewhat </p><p>reassuring, the appearance of these harsh sentences remains </p><p>disquieting and bears monitoring.  End Comment. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
