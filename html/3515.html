(U)  SUMMARY.  NGHE AN PROVINCIAL OFFICIALS ARE HOPEFUL </p><p>THAT A STRATEGIC LOCATION AND IMPROVING (THOUGH STILL WEAK) </p><p>INFRASTRUCTURE WILL IMPROVE DEVELOPMENT AND THE PROVINCE\'S </p><p>ROLE AS AN OUTLET TO THE SEA FOR LAOS AND NORTHEASTERN </p><p>THAILAND.  THE GVN IS MOVING AHEAD WITH PLANS FOR A NEW </p><p>NATIONAL BORDER CROSSING WITH LAOS, BUT THE ROAD TO THE </p><p>BORDER, WHILE IMPROVING, IS POOR.  SEPTELS WILL REPORT ON </p><p>NARCOTICS AND TERRORISM ISSUES.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  POLOFF AND POL FSN VISITED NGHE AN PROVINCE AUGUST </p><p>13-15.  VINH, THE PROVINCIAL CAPITAL, HAS ABOUT 200,000 </p><p>PEOPLE AND IS LOCATED ABOUT 300 KILOMETERS DOWN NATIONAL </p><p>HIGHWAY 1 FROM HANOI.  IN A GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE </p><p>PROVINCE, NGUYEN SY CUONG, VICE CHIEF OF STAFF FOR FOREIGN </p><p>AFFAIRS, NGHE AN PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE, SAID THAT NGHE AN, WITH </p><p>ABOUT 16,500 SQUARE KILOMETERS, IS VIETNAM\'S THIRD LARGEST </p><p>PROVINCE AND SHARES A LONG BORDER WITH LAOS TO THE WEST. </p><p>THERE IS ONE INTERNATIONAL BORDER CROSSING, LOCATED AT NAM </p><p>CAN, ABOUT 280 MOSTLY BUMPY KILOMETERS UP HIGHWAY 7 FROM </p><p>VINH (REFTEL).  A NEW NATIONAL BORDER CROSSING IS UNDER </p><p>CONSTRUCTION AT THANH THUY, LOCATED ABOUT 90 KILOMETERS UP </p><p>HIGHWAY 46 FROM VINH. (NOTE:  THE NEW BORDER CROSSING DOES </p><p>NOT YET APPEAR ON EMBASSY HANOI ADMINISTRATIVE MAPS, BUT IS </p><p>INCLUDED IN PROVINCIAL MINISTRY OF PLANNING AND INVESTMENT </p><p>(MPI) DOCUMENTS.  END NOTE.)  NGHE AN HAS A PORT AT CUA LO, </p><p>ABOUT 15 KILOMETERS NORTHEAST OF VINH.  NATIONAL HIGHWAY 1 </p><p>AND THE MAIN NORTH-SOUTH RAILWAY LINE BOTH TRAVERSE THE </p><p>PROVINCE.  IN ADDITION, THERE IS ALSO AN AIRPORT AT VINH </p><p>WITH REGULAR FLIGHTS TO HANOI AND HO CHI MINH CITY.  CUONG </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02028  01 OF 03  160853Z </p><p>SAID THAT NGHE AN\'S LOCATION, ABOUT HALFWAY BETWEEN HANOI </p><p>AND HUE, IS A PLUS, AS WELL AS HAVING THE MAJOR ROAD, RAIL, </p><p>AND AIR LINKS,  "THESE ALL MAKE NGHE AN AN ATTRACTIVE </p><p>PROVINCE FOR FOREIGN INVESTMENT, CUONG CLAIMED." </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  NGHE AN HAS A POPULATION OF APPROXIMATELY THREE </p><p>MILLION, MAKING IT THE THIRD MOST POPULOUS PROVINCE IN THE </p><p>COUNTRY.  HILLS AND MOUNTAINS COVER ABOUT 80 PERCENT OF THE </p><p>PROVINCE.  ON THE ARABLE AREAS, FARMERS GROW MAINLY RICE, </p><p>CORN, SWEET POTATOES, AND PEANUTS.  IN HIGHER ELEVATIONS, </p><p>COFFEE, TEA, RUBBER TREES, AND PINEAPPLE ARE CULTIVATED. </p><p>IMPORTANT INDUSTRIES INCLUDE CEMENT (THREE FACTORIES), </p><p>TEXTILES, AND SEA PRODUCTS.  THE PER CAPITA INCOME IS ABOUT </p><p>USD 300 PER YEAR, ABOUT 25 PERCENT UNDER THE NATIONAL </p><p>AVERAGE OF ABOUT USD 400 PER YEAR.  CUONG SAID THE GDP </p><p>GROWTH RATE IS "STRONG," AT ABOUT NINE PERCENT THE LAST TWO </p><p>YEARS, BUT A MAJOR PRIORITY OF PROVINCIAL AUTHORITIES IS TO </p><p>"SEE THIS REFLECTED IN THE PER CAPITA INCOME." </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>NEW BORDER CROSSING - BRING YOUR LAND CRUISER </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  CUONG SAID THAT WORK IS ONGOING FOR A NEW "NATIONAL </p><p>BORDER CROSSING" AT THANH THUY, ABOUT 90 KILOMETERS UP </p><p>HIGHWAY 46 FROM VINH.  HE SAID PROVINCIAL AUTHORITIES HOPE </p><p>THE NEW BORDER CROSSING WILL IMPROVE TRADE FROM LAOS AND </p><p>NORTHEAST THAILAND, SINCE IT IS MUCH CLOSER TO THE CUA LO </p><p>PORT THAN THE INTERNATIONAL BORDER CROSSING AT NAM CAN </p><p>(REFTEL).  ACCORDING TO CUONG, THE GVN PLANS TO EVENTUALLY </p><p>MAKE THIS AN INTERNATIONAL BORDER CROSSING AND ESTABLISH A </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02028  01 OF 03  160853Z </p><p>"SPECIAL BORDER ECONOMIC ZONE IN THE AREA," TO INCLUDE </p><p>BUSINESSES, A CUSTOMS OFFICE, BANKS, AND OTHER ACTIVITIES. </p><p>HE PREDICTED THIS WOULD BE POSSIBLE "WITHIN A COUPLE YEARS." </p><p>CUONG SAID THESE DEVELOPMENTS ARE IMPORTANT FOR VIETNAM\'S </p><p>"REGIONAL INTEGRATION."  CURRENTLY, MORE CROSS BORDER </p><p>TRAFFIC "IS PROBABLY" COMING THROUGH HA TINH PROVINCE, </p><p>LOCATED JUST SOUTH OF NGHE AN, BECAUSE THERE IS ALSO A PORT, </p><p>AN ESTABLISHED BORDER CROSSING, AND A "RELATIVELY GOOD </p><p>ROAD." (HIGHWAY 8). </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  EMBOFFS\' TRIP TO THE PROPOSED BORDER CROSSING </p><p>PROVED AN AMBITIOUS TASK.  HIGHWAY 46 IS ONLY PAVED ABOUT </p><p>HALF THE DISTANCE.  THE FIRST 25 KILOMETERS FROM VINH ARE </p><p>UNDERGOING IMPROVEMENT AND IT APPEARS THAT SECTION WILL BE </p><p>RELATIVELY GOOD WITHIN SIX MONTHS TO A YEAR.  AFTER PASSING </p><p>THROUGH THE SMALL TOWN OF DUNG, ABOUT 40 KILOMETERS FROM </p><p>VINH, THE ROAD IS UNPAVED AND GRADUALLY BECOMES QUITE BUMPY </p><p>AND RUTTED.  IN ADDITION, THERE ARE NUMEROUS TURNS TO GET TO </p><p>THANH THUY, NONE OF WHICH IS SIGNPOSTED.  EVEN AN </p><p>EXPERIENCED EMBASSY DRIVER HAD TO STOP SEVERAL TIMES TO </p><p>CONFIRM DIRECTIONS.  THE TRIP ALSO INCLUDED FORDING A STREAM </p><p>WHERE THERE WAS NO BRIDGE.  A LOCAL PERSON ENCOUNTERED ON </p><p>THE BANK SAID THE STREAM EXISTS ONLY DURING THE RAINY SEASON </p><p>AND IT IS "NOT USUALLY A PROBLEM TO CROSS, UNLESS THERE HAS </p><p>BEEN VERY HEAVY RAIN." </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ9132 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HANOI  02028  02 OF 03  160854Z </p><p>ACTION EAP-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00  CTME-00 </p><p>      ITCE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EXME-00  E-00 </p><p>      FAAE-00  FBIE-00  UTED-00  VC-00    FRB-00   H-01     TEDE-00 </p><p>      INR-00   IO-00    ITC-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    DCP-01 </p><p>      NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OES-01   OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00 </p><p>      PER-00   PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    SSO-00 </p><p>      STR-00   TEST-00  TRSE-00  USIE-00  EPAE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00 </p><p>      PRM-00   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /012W </p><p>                  ------------------DA0C18  160854Z /38 </p><p>P 160845Z AUG 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HANOI </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 7299 </p><p>INFO AMCONSUL HO CHI MINH CITY </p><p>ASEAN COLLECTIVE </p><p>USCINCPAC HONOLULU HI//FPA// </p><p>SECDEF WASHDC//ISA/ABLAGG// </p><p>USDOC WASHDC </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 03 HANOI 002028 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p>USDOC FOR 1431/MAC/AP/HPPHO </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  02028  02 OF 03  160854Z </p><p>6.  (U)  EMBOFFS MANAGED TO GET TO WITHIN EIGHT KILOMETERS </p><p>OF THE NEW BORDER CROSSING, WHICH IS ACTUALLY ABOUT 17 </p><p>KILOMETERS BEYOND THE VILLAGE OF THANH THUY.  HOWEVER, </p><p>FURTHER PROGRESS WAS IMPOSSIBLE, WITH THE ROAD BLOCKED DUE </p><p>TO ONGOING CONSTRUCTION OVER A GULLY.  A LOCAL WOMAN </p><p>BRINGING VEGETABLES TO CONSTRUCTION WORKERS ON HER </p><p>MOTORBIKE, EXPLAINED THAT THE BORDER ROAD HAD BEEN CLOSED </p><p>FOR "ABOUT ONE WEEK."  SHE SAID SHE HEARD IT WOULD BE OPEN </p><p>IN ABOUT ONE MONTH.  PRIOR TO THE CONSTRUCTION, LAO AND </p><p>VIETNAMESE CROSSED BACK AND FORTH "REGULARLY."  WITH A </p><p>TRAVEL PERMIT, IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE TO STAY OVERNIGHT.  SHE </p><p>HAD HEARD AN OCCASIONAL FOREIGNER CROSSED, BUT SUSPECTED </p><p>THESE WERE PROBABLY PEOPLE WORKING FOR AID ORGANIZATIONS OR </p><p>THE UNITED NATIONS-NOT TOURISTS.  THE VENDOR SAID SHE HOPED </p><p>THE NEW BORDER CROSSING AND ROAD IMPROVEMENT WOULD INCREASE </p><p>CROSS BORDER TRADE, BUT NOTED, "WE ARE POOR ON THIS SIDE AND </p><p>THE LAO ARE EVEN POORER ON THE OTHER SIDE." </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>TRADE DEVELOPMENT:  SLOW, BUT WE\'RE LEARNING </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  CUONG AND DOAN NAM, VICE DIRECTOR OF THE PROVINCIAL </p><p>MPI, SAID SEPARATELY THAT THEY ARE OPTIMISTIC REGARDING </p><p>IMPROVED TRADE AND INVESTMENT WITH THE U.S. IN THE WAKE OF </p><p>THE U.S.-VIETNAM BILATERAL TRADE AGREEMENT (BTA).  NAM SAID </p><p>THAT THERE HAS NOT BEEN "A SIGNIFICANT" INCREASE IN INTEREST </p><p>FROM US INVESTORS, BUT HE EXPECTS IT WILL COME "IN TIME." </p><p>ONE MAJOR BENEFIT HAS BEEN THE OPPORTUNITY FOR VIETNAMESE </p><p>OFFICIALS AND BUSINESS PEOPLE TO TRAVEL TO THE U.S. TO LEARN </p><p>MORE ABOUT THE MARKETS THERE.  IN ADDITION, SEMINARS </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02028  02 OF 03  160854Z </p><p>ORGANIZED BY GVN OFFICIALS HAVE HELPED THE LOCAL BUSINESS </p><p>COMMUNITY BETTER UNDERSTAND THE BTA AND WHAT NEEDS TO BE </p><p>DONE TO COMPETE IN THE US MARKET.  CUONG OF THE PEOPLE\'S </p><p>COMMITTEE SAID THAT MANY VIETNAMESE BUSINESS PEOPLE DO NOT </p><p>YET UNDERSTAND HOW TO DO BUSINESS WITH THE U.S., BUT IN THE </p><p>LONG RUN, THE BTA "WILL BENEFIT EVERYBODY."  CUONG SAID </p><p>BASED ON FACTORS SUCH AS THE NGHE AN\'S "CENTRAL LOCATION," </p><p>THE RAILWAY, HIGHWAY 1, THE AIRPORT AT VINH, AND THE PORT, </p><p>HE IS OPTIMISTIC. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>LACK OF INFRASTRUCTURE INLAND </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U)  THE MPI\'S NAM SAID THAT WHILE CONDITIONS ARE </p><p>GENERALLY IMPROVING IN NGHE AN, DEVELOPMENT IS STILL </p><p>HINDERED BY A LACK OF INFRASTRUCTURE.  SPECIFICALLY, HE </p><p>NOTED THAT COMMUNICATIONS ARE POOR, WITH "SOME RURAL AREAS" </p><p>HAVING NO PHONE SERVICE AND NO INFRASTRUCTURE FOR MOBILE </p><p>TELEPHONES.  IN ADDITION, THE INLAND ROAD SYSTEM IS "NOT </p><p>WELL DEVELOPED."  CUONG SAID SEPARATELY, "YOU HAVE SEEN </p><p>HIGHWAY 7 (REFTEL), SO YOU KNOW THE PROBLEMS WE FACE AS AN </p><p>OUTLET TO THE SEA FOR OUR NEIGHBORS."  CUONG ALSO MENTIONED </p><p>THE NEED TO UPGRADE INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGY.  HE CITED ONE </p><p>SHOE FACTORY JOINT VENTURE WITH GERMANY THAT WAS FORCED TO </p><p>CLOSE LAST YEAR BECAUSE GERMANY "DID NOT SEEM INTERESTED" IN </p><p>PROVIDING UP-TO-DATE TECHNOLOGY.  AS A RESULT, CUONG SAID </p><p>THE FACTORY COULD NOT MEET QUALITY STANDARDS FOR EXPORT. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>PORT PLAYS A ROLE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02028  02 OF 03  160854Z </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U)  LE DINH NHAM, VICE GENERAL MANAGER OF THE NGHE TINH </p><p>PORT, LOCATED AT CUA LO (ABOUT 15 KILOMETERS NORTHEAST OF </p><p>VINH) SAID THAT HIS ROLE IS TO "HELP THE PROVINCE DEVELOP." </p><p>THE PORT, WHILE NOT NEARLY AS LARGE AS DANANG\'S, CAN HANDLE </p><p>SHIPS UP TO 10,000 TONS AND CURRENTLY HAS 550 METERS OF </p><p>BERTHS.  MOST SHIPS COMING INTO PORT ARE FROM INDIA, </p><p>MALAYSIA, ROK, PHILIPPINES, JAPAN, AND "STILL A FEW" FROM </p><p>RUSSIA.  THE PORT HANDLES BOTH DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL </p><p>CARGO AND IS FULLY STAFFED WITH CUSTOMS, HEALTH, AND POLICE </p><p>OFFICES.  APPROXIMATELY 800,000 TONS OF CARGO PASSED THROUGH </p><p>THE PORT IN 2001.  NHAM ESTIMATED ABOUT 15 PERCENT CAME FROM </p><p>LAOS, MOSTLY PROCESSED FORESTRY PRODUCTS GOING OUT AND </p><p>MANUFACTURED GOODS GOING IN.  HE PREDICTED THAT THE AMOUNT </p><p>TO/FROM LAOS "MAY DECLINE" BECAUSE HE HEARD THE GVN HAS AN </p><p>AGREEMENT WITH THE LAO GOVERNMENT TO ENCOURAGE USING VUNG </p><p>ANG PORT IN HA TINH PROVINCE, IMMEDIATELY TO THE SOUTH, AND </p><p>PLANS TO BUILD A NEW ROAD PARALLEL TO HIGHWAY 8.  (NOTE: </p><p>ACCORDING TO THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS, VIETNAM AND </p><p>LAOS OFFICIALS REACHED A "VERBAL AGREEMENT" ON USING VUNG </p><p>ANG PORT AT THE 24TH SESSION OF THE VIETNAM-LAOS </p><p>INTERGOVERNMENTAL COMMITTEE ON ECONOMIC, CULTURAL, </p><p>SCIENTIFIC, AND TECHNICAL COOPERATION, HELD IN JANUARY 2001. </p><p>END NOTE.)

WHILE </p><p>THE TRANSPORTATION FACILITIES IN AND OUT OF THE PROVINCIAL </p><p>CAPITAL ARE A PLUS, THINGS GO DOWNHILL FAST AS ONE MOVES </p><p>INLAND TOWARDS THE LAO BORDER.  BASED ON TWO EMBASSY TRIPS </p><p>TO NGHE AN OVER THE PAST 9 MONTHS, IT SEEMS CLEAR THAT </p><p>GENERAL DEVELOPMENT, AS WELL AS PROGRESS IN BECOMING MORE </p><p>PROMINENT AS AN OUTLET TO SEA FOR ITS NEIGHBORS, IS STILL A </p><p>WORK IN PROGRESS.
