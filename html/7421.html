<p>UNCLAS ABU DHABI 001789 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR IRAQ TASK FORCE, ALSO NEA/ARP, NEA/RA, </p><p>PRM/ANE, AND IO/UNP </p><p>KUWAIT FOR HOC </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAID, PREL, PGOV, PHUM, IZ, TC </p><p>SUBJECT:  TFIZ01: UAEG OFFERS MEDICAL TREATMENT TO </p><p>INJURED IRAQIS </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABU DHABI 1662 AND PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p>1.  The Office of the Chairman of the General Health </p><p>Authority for the Emirate of Abu Dhabi Hamed bin Zayid </p><p>Al-Nahyan publicly announced on April 13 that the UAE </p><p>Red Crescent Authority (RCA) has been authorized to </p><p>transport wounded Iraqi civilians to the UAE for </p><p>medical treatment.  The spokesman said that the UAEG </p><p>recognizes that Iraqi hospitals are simply overwhelmed </p><p>by the number of patients, and the types of trauma </p><p>encountered, since the onset of hostilities in Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>2.  According to press reports, each state-run </p><p>hospital in Abu Dhabi Emirate reserves part of its </p><p>facilities to treat foreign patients in extraordinary </p><p>circumstances.  The medical care would be provided </p><p>free of charge, and the RCA would arrange for the </p><p>transport of the wounded from Iraq.  Comment: The </p><p>announcement is not unusual for the UAEG, which also </p><p>offered free medical treatment to wounded Palestinians </p><p>following the devastation of the Jenin refugee camp </p><p>last year.  We will seek to coordinate this effort </p><p>with the RCA through the Humanitarian Operations </p><p>Center (HOC) in Kuwait, and provide further details </p><p>when we receive them.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
