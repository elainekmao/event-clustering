<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 002976 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ELAB, ETRD, EIND, PHUM, SOCI, NI, AID </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: UPDATE OF THE CHILD LABOR INFORMATION FOR </p><p>TRADE AND DEVELOPMENT ACT (GSP) REPORTING REQUIREMENTS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: SECSTATE 168607 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  Laws and Regulations Proscribing the Worst Forms of Child </p><p>Labor:  In 2002, President Obasanjo signed the instruments of </p><p>ratification for ILO Convention 182, Worst Form of Child </p><p>Labor, Convention 138, Minimum Age for Employment, and </p><p>Convention 111, Equality of Occupation.  Some form of </p><p>legislation prohibiting child labor has existed in Nigeria </p><p>since colonial times.  Nigeria\'s 1974 labor decree prohibits </p><p>children under 15 years from working in commerce and industry </p><p>and restricts other child labor to home-based agricultural or </p><p>domestic work.  Federal law further stipulates that no person </p><p>under the age of 16 may be employed more than eight hours per </p><p>day. Most states have also adopted laws proscribing child </p><p>labor practices, namely street trading, in the past decade. </p><p>Youth apprenticeship is permitted under specific conditions. </p><p>Primary education is compulsory, and the minimum age </p><p>requirement is consistent with the age for completing </p><p>educational requirements. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  Forced or compulsory labor is also outlawed by the 1974 </p><p>decree.  The national labor code addresses hazardous forms of </p><p>work for all workers.  Draft legislation was under review in </p><p>the National Assembly in 2002 that would make trafficking in </p><p>persons (including children) a crime; however, no action has </p><p>so far been taken by the legislature. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  Laws and Regulations for Implementing and Enforcing </p><p>Proscriptions against the Worst Forms of Child Labor:  Legal </p><p>remedies available to government enforcement agencies include </p><p>criminal penalties and civil fines.  Enforcement provisions </p><p>have not been applied successfully and do not deter </p><p>violations.  Where child labor abuses coincide with other </p><p>criminal offenses, such as rape, authorities may investigate, </p><p>prosecute, and punish the responsible party for the non-labor </p><p>violation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  Formal Institutional Mechanisms to Investigate and </p><p>Address Complaints Relating to the Worst Forms of Child </p><p>Labor:  There has been slow but noticeable progress in </p><p>improving GON capacity to investigate and address abusive </p><p>child labor practices.  The National Labour Advisory Council </p><p>(NLAC) is responsible for enforcing federal regulations and </p><p>for receiving and investigating child labor complaints.  In </p><p>2000, the government exchanged a Memorandum of Understanding </p><p>with the International Programme on Elimination of Child </p><p>Labour (IPEC) to fund and develop implementation plans for C. </p><p>182 provisions.  NLAC, IPEC and UNICEF are coordinating </p><p>efforts to develop enforcement strategies, the focus of which </p><p>is awareness and official training activities.  The Ministry </p><p>of Employment, Labour and Productivity recently established a </p><p>special office for child labor issues. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  Despite increased institutional momentum and </p><p>organization, no child labor violation inspections or </p><p>investigations have resulted in fines, penalties, or </p><p>convictions to date.  A recent trial to prosecute a prominent </p><p>suspected child trafficker was dismissed when material </p><p>witnesses failed to testify about the children\'s identities </p><p>or the nature of their relationship to the suspect.  The </p><p>extent to which prosecutors investigated the witnesses\' </p><p>motives for their unwillingness to cooperate is unknown. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  Social Programs Implemented to Prevent the Engagement of </p><p>Children in, or Assist in Removing Children from, the Worst </p><p>Forms of Child Labor:  Extended school participation is </p><p>generally acknowledged as the best means to deter child </p><p>labor.  Although primary education is compulsory, this </p><p>requirement is not rigorously enforced and many primary </p><p>school aged children work when they should be in the </p><p>classroom.   A source with extensive academic and work </p><p>experience on child labor issues believes the government\'s </p><p>commitment to improving educational access is genuine, </p><p>although the results of its initiative have not been </p><p>evaluated.  Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) frequently </p><p>criticize the government for failing to fund their programs, </p><p>which they argue could help reduce child participation in the </p><p>workforce. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. Comprehensive Policy or National Program Aimed at </p><p>Eliminating the Worst Forms of Child Labor:  The collective </p><p>body of domestic labor laws and international conventions </p><p>ratified this year provides a solid legal foundation to </p><p>address child labor problems. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  Progress Toward Eliminating the Worst Forms of Child </p><p>Labor: Since returning to civilian rule in 1999, Nigeria has </p><p>made progress addressing child labor abuses.  Twenty years </p><p>ago, child labor issues were virtually ignored by </p><p>academicians and government officials alike.  Within the past </p><p>decade, awareness of the issue has spread.  In the past three </p><p>years, Nigeria\'s liberalized political atmosphere has allowed </p><p>NGOs to grow and more adequately address child labor and </p><p>other social issues. Recognizing that more needs to be done, </p><p>new ideas and more energy are being directed to address the </p><p>most egregious child labor problems.   Several high-profile </p><p>political personalities, including the wife of the President, </p><p>wife of the Vice-President, and the wives of several State </p><p>governors, have campaigned on behalf of children, and against </p><p>prostitution, child labor and trafficking in children. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  The challenges to progress are formidable.  The sixteen </p><p>years of military rule prior to 1999 left a legacy of </p><p>increasing child labor practices with limited capacity for </p><p>governmental enforcement of existing laws.  Military </p><p>enforcement of child labor laws consisted of periodic sweeps </p><p>and dragnets to arrest child workers but little was done to </p><p>regulate or deter law-breaking employers.  These sweeps </p><p>usually resulted in an increased number of new child laborers </p><p>taking the places of those who had been arrested, which had </p><p>the unintended effect of increasing child labor </p><p>participation. </p><p>10.  Increasing poverty and the need to supplement meager </p><p>family incomes has forced many children into the employment </p><p>market, which is unable to absorb their labor due to high </p><p>levels of unemployment.  The use of children as beggars, </p><p>hawkers, etc. in the informal sector is widespread in urban </p><p>areas.  Some families rely exclusively on child breadwinners </p><p>to survive. In 1999, one study found approximately 100 </p><p>locations in Lagos with two to three regular child workers. </p><p>Surveys over the past decade estimate that the number of </p><p>children working after school has increased from one out of </p><p>three to two out of three.  The average age of child workers </p><p>has also dropped.  Quality of child worker training has </p><p>decreased as younger workers are trained increasingly by </p><p>peers nearer their own age rather than by experienced adult </p><p>laborers.  This in turn has increased the risks associated </p><p>with work. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  Historical perceptions about social mobility also impede </p><p>efforts to end child labor.  Many rural parents believe that </p><p>sending their children to work for wealthy urban </p><p>professionals will significantly improve both their immediate </p><p>and future living standards.  Traditional practice in this </p><p>respect does not regard child labor as exploitative. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  Few statistics were available to quantify the success of </p><p>ongoing anti-trafficking campaigns.  Meaningful studies of </p><p>the extent of child labor are lacking in Nigeria due to </p><p>several barriers.  Accurate measurements take time and </p><p>resources are unavailable to domestic NGOs or academic </p><p>researchers.   Researchers find it difficult to establish a </p><p>rapport with working children necessary to investigate their </p><p>conditions.  Child laborers in Nigeria fear the motives of </p><p>child labor researchers and are a "moving target" for </p><p>census-takers.  Thus, comprehensive analysis of child labor </p><p>in Nigeria remains elusive. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
