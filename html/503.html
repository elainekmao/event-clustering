(C)  SUMMARY.  AT A MARCH 21 PRESS </p><p>CONFERENCE, EX-PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA CALLED FOR </p><p>A NATIONAL FRONT AGAINST FUJIMORI; HE ALSO RULED </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        LIMA  04541  01 OF 02  261219Z </p><p>OUT HIS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT IN 1995.  GARCIA </p><p>BLASTED ATTEMPTS BY THE FUJIMORI ADMINISTRATION </p><p>TO REOPEN CORRUPTION CHARGES AGAINST HIM.  FEW </p><p>IN LIMA BELIEVE THAT GARCIA WILL NOT RUN FOR </p><p>PRESIDENT; IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN HOW MANY ARE </p><p>WILLING TO FOLLOW HIS LEAD INTO A NATIONAL </p><p>ANTI-FUJIMORI FRONT.  END SUMMARY. </p><p>REOPENING THE GARCIA CORRUPTION CASE </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  THE CATALYST FOR GARCIA\'S PRESS </p><p>CONFERENCE WAS THE GOP\'S PUBLISHING OF A SUPREME </p><p>DECREE AUTHORIZING THE SOLICITOR GENERAL TO </p><p>REOPEN THE "ILLICIT ENRICHMENT" CHARGES AGAINST </p><p>GARCIA.  GARCIA\'S LAWYERS IMMEDIATELY HAD A </p><p>LOW-LEVEL JUDGE ISSUE AN INJUNCTION AGAINST </p><p>REOPENING THE CASE ON THE GROUNDS OF DOUBLE </p><p>JEOPARDY.  GARCIA TOLD THE PRESS CONFERENCE THAT </p><p>THE SUPREME DECREE WAS A "JUDICIAL MONSTROSITY" </p><p>AND THAT IT WAS THE ANSWER BY THE FUJIMORI </p><p>ADMINISTRATION TO GARCIA\'S CRITICISM OF GOP </p><p>POLICIES.  GARCIA DECLARED IT WAS THE TIME TO </p><p>BREAK THE INFORMAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE </p><p>PRESIDENT AND APRA AGAINST CRITICIZING THE </p><p>ADMINISTRATION.  HE BLAMED FUJIMORI AND SOME OF </p><p>HIS "MILITARY ADVISORS" FOR USING EVEN THE TAX </p><p>OFFICE TO PERSECUTE HIM. </p><p> </p><p>GARCIA CALLS FOR A NATIONAL ANTI-FUJIMORI FRONT </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        LIMA  04541  01 OF 02  261219Z </p><p>4.  (U)  GARCIA DECLARED THAT FOR THE LAST 18 </p><p>MONTHS THE PERUVIAN PEOPLE HAD SUFFERED A PLAGUE </p><p>OF "VICIOUS CAPITALISM" THAT HAD NOT BORN </p><p>CONCRETE RESULTS.  HE CHARACTERIZED FUJIMORI\'S </p><p>TRIP TO JAPAN AS A COMPLETE FAILURE SINCE THE </p><p>PRESIDENT RETURNED WITH "ONLY USDOLS 20 MILLION </p><p>IN DONATIONS."  GARCIA CHARGED THAT BUSINESSMEN </p><p>WHO THAT TRAVEL WITH FUJIMORI DO SO ONLY TO TAKE </p><p>ADVANTAGE OF MONEY TO BE MADE OFF OF ASSISTANCE </p><p>CONTRACTS.  GARCIA ADDED THAT THE GULF BETWEEN </p><p>FUJIMORI AND THE CONGRESS IS WIDENING AND THAT </p><p>EVEN THE PRESIDENT OF THE SENATE CANNOT GET AN </p><p>APPOINTMENT TO SEE THE PRESIDENT. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  REFERRING TO FAILURE OF MOTHERS FROM </p><p>THE "GLASS OF MILK" PROGRAM TO SEE A GOP </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE, GARCIA ASKED, "WHAT DANGER DO </p><p>THESE POOR PERUVIAN MOTHERS REPRESENT WHEN THEY </p><p>ONLY ASK FOR BREAD FOR THEIR CHILDREN?"  HE </p><p>ALLEGED THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS CUT OFF IN THE </p><p>PALACE WITHOUT THE SUPPORT OF A STRONG ORGANIZED </p><p>PARTY.  THE OPPOSITION WAS COMPOSED OF A RIGHT </p><p>WHOSE LEADER (MARIO VARGAS LLOSA) HAD LEFT THE </p><p>COUNTRY, APRA WHICH HAD JUST LEFT OFFICE, AND A </p><p>FRACTURED LEFT.  GARCIA STATED THAT THE ONLY WAY </p><p>TO OPPOSE FUJIMORI WAS BY FORMING A UNITED FRONT </p><p>FROM THESE ELEMENTS TO SUPPORT ECONOMIC </p><p>REVITALIZATION AND PACIFICATION. </p><p> </p><p>"I WILL NOT RUN FOR PRESIDENT" </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        LIMA  04541  01 OF 02  261219Z </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  GARCIA CLAIMED THAT AN IMPEDIMENT TO A </p><p>SUCCESSFUL OPPOSITION TO FUJIMORI WAS THE </p><p>CONFLICTING AMBITIONS OF POSSIBLE PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>CANDIDATES.  THE WAY TO SOLVE THIS </p><p>"CANDIDITITIS" WAS FOR POLITICAL LEADERS TO </p><p>RENOUNCE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT.  TO SET THE </p><p>EXAMPLE HE SAID, "I RENOUNCE BEING A CANDIDATE </p><p>FOR THE PRESIDENCY OF THE REPUBLIC IN 1995 TO </p><p>PAVE THE WAY FOR THE NATIONAL FRONT." </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        LIMA  04541  02 OF 02  261220Z </p><p>ACTION ARA-01 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   ACDA-15  AMAD-01  CIAE-00  C-01     DODE-00  HA-09 </p><p>      H-01     INM-01   INRE-00  INR-01   L-03     ADS-00   NSAE-00 </p><p>      NSCE-00  OMB-01   PA-01    PM-01    PRS-01   P-01     SNP-01 </p><p>      SP-01    SS-01    TRSE-00  T-01     USIE-00    /042W </p><p>                  ------------------1F734B  261220Z /38 </p><p>P 261214Z MAR 92 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY LIMA </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 6840 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY BOGOTA </p><p>AMEMBASSY CARACAS </p><p>AMEMBASSY LA PAZ </p><p>AMEMBASSY QUITO </p><p>USCINCSO QUARRY HEIGHTS PM </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 LIMA 04541 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SOUTHCOM ALSO FOR POLAD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL:  OADR </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PE, PE       PGOV </p><p>SUBJECT:     GARCIA OPENS HIS PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  FEW IN LIMA TAKE SERIOUSLY GARCIA\'S VOW </p><p>THAT HE WILL NOT BE A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE. </p><p>LAST MONTH HE PROCLAIMED THAT HE WAS NOT A </p><p>CANDIDATE FOR SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE APRA </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        LIMA  04541  02 OF 02  261220Z </p><p>PARTY.  WITHIN TWO WEEKS HE GRACIOUSLY ACCEPTED </p><p>THE JOB AFTER THE APRA CONVENTION INSISTED BY </p><p>ACCLAMATION THAT HE AGREE TO ACCEPT THE HONOR. </p><p>THE LIKELIHOOD OF HIS ORGANIZING A NATIONAL </p><p>FRONT AGAINST FUJIMORI IS SLIM.  THE SECRETARY </p><p>GENERAL OF THE ULTRA-LEFT PUM PARTY, A PARTY </p><p>THAT SHARES THE SUBSTANCE OF MANY OF GARCIA\'S </p><p>CRITICISMS AGAINST FUJIMORI, TOLD POLOFFS THAT </p><p>"HIS PARTY WOULD NEVER COOPERATE WITH APRA."  HE </p><p>EXPLAINED THAT HE COULD DEAL WITH THE RIGHT </p><p>BECAUSE HE KNEW THEIR IDEOLOGICAL POSITION, BUT </p><p>COULD NOT COOPERATE WITH APRA BECAUSE THEY WERE </p><p>SIMPLE OPPORTUNISTS.  THE OTHER PARTIES MAY BE </p><p>PLAYING THE SAME SONG, BUT THEY ARE HIGHLY </p><p>UNLIKELY TO ACCEPT ALAN GARCIA LEADING THE </p><p>BAND.
