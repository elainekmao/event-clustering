<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 000446 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS AND DRL/BA </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL - RIEGEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:    N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: TALES FROM TRIBHUVAN HOSPITAL:  MAOIST VICTIMS </p><p>TELL THEIR STORIES </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>CIVILIAN SUFFERING </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) In addition to the 650 policemen and 90 Royal </p><p>Nepal Army soldiers they have killed, Maoists have </p><p>beaten, stabbed, shot or burned to death nearly 400 </p><p>civilians since the insurgency began in 1996--more than </p><p>50 of those victims in just the three months since the </p><p>insurgents unilaterally broke off the ceasefire November </p><p>23.  Most of the Maoists\' civilian targets are local </p><p>government officials, teachers, or supporters of the </p><p>governing Nepali Congress Party.  The number of </p><p>civilians injured, maimed, or assaulted by the </p><p>insurgents is unknown, but each day the government-owned </p><p>Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital in Kathmandu </p><p>admits and treats victims of such attacks.  On Feb. 26 </p><p>Tribhuvan staff reported treating 25 patients (including </p><p>7 Armed Police victims of a landmine) for injuries </p><p>sustained from Maoist attacks.  Poloff visited and </p><p>interviewed some of the victims; highlights of their </p><p>stories follow below. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>KHAGENDRA RAJ REGMI </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  On the night of Feb. 9 three armed Maoists </p><p>knocked on the door of Khagendra Raj Regmi, District </p><p>Committee Chairman of the Nepali Congress Party and </p><p>brother of Prime Minister Deuba\'s Chief Secretary, in </p><p>Syangja District in western Nepal.  Regmi said when he </p><p>came out, he observed an additional 30 or so Maoists had </p><p>surrounded his house.  The Maoists asked Regmi to come </p><p>with them to an undisclosed location, but he refused. </p><p>The assailants then shot him three times (twice in the </p><p>chest; one bullet grazed his head and hit his hand) and </p><p>fled.  Regmi\'s entire family has left their home in the </p><p>district and relocated to Kathmandu. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>PADAM PRASAD SILWAL </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  On the morning of Feb. 18, a group of five </p><p>Maoists, armed with pistols, guns, and khukuri knives, </p><p>approached Padam Prasad Silwal, a Nepali Congress </p><p>supporter and small shopowner, as he sat on the porch of </p><p>his home in Chitwan District in south-central Nepal. </p><p>According to Silwal, the armed men suddenly began to </p><p>stab him in the head, back and hands, completely </p><p>chopping off one of his fingers.  A son who tried to </p><p>shield his father was shot and wounded.  Silwal said he </p><p>had frequently been approached by Maoists in the past </p><p>for "donations," especially fuel from his small gas </p><p>pump, and had always complied with their demands.  He </p><p>has no idea why he was targeted and did not recognize </p><p>any of his attackers.  He, his wife, and three sons (one </p><p>of whom is recovering in another hospital) have fled </p><p>their village, leaving all their belongings behind them, </p><p>and are afraid to return.  They have no way to support </p><p>themselves while in Kathmandu.  One son bitterly </p><p>described the family as "refugees." </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>CHATTRA RAJ BHANDARI </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  Chattra Raj Bhandari said he was attacked by </p><p>a band of about 35 Maoists at his home the night of </p><p>December 23.  The group forced him out of his house, </p><p>tied his hands behind his back, and beat him on the </p><p>head, hands, and legs with an iron rod.  A farmer from </p><p>Phrkot Village in Tanahu District, Bhandari said he </p><p>suspects he was targeted because he supports (but is not </p><p>an organizer for) the Nepali Congress Party. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>KURMI DAGAURA CHAUDHARI </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  About midnight on January 25, Kurmi Dagaura </p><p>Chaudhari of Banskati, Kailali, was forced out of his </p><p>house, along with his cousin, by a group of 12 </p><p>insurgents.   Both men were severely beaten, dragged </p><p>more than a kilometer from their home, dumped into a </p><p>ditch and left for dead.  Chaudhari regained </p><p>consciousness by early morning, however, climbed out of </p><p>the ditch, and made it back home (despite his broken </p><p>arms and legs).  His cousin did not survive the attack. </p><p>Chaudhari, the village postman, said he is not </p><p>affiliated with any political party but used to urge </p><p>young people in his neighborhood, which is heavily </p><p>affected by the insurgency, not to join the Maoists. </p><p>His village is about 70 km from the nearest sizable </p><p>presence of Government security forces .  He said he did </p><p>not recognize any of his attackers. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) Since the beginning of the insurgency, the </p><p>Maoists have attacked civilians they consider class </p><p>enemies, but as the state of emergency and subsequent </p><p>Army mobilization limit the range of military targets </p><p>available, the volume of attacks against civilians seems </p><p>to be sharply increasing.  In the early days of the </p><p>conflict, the Maoists sought to popularize a romantic </p><p>notion of themselves as champions of the common man or </p><p>woman against Government oppression. But none of the </p><p>victims interviewed at Tribhuvan was powerful, </p><p>prosperous, or (with the possible exception of Regmi\'s </p><p>family connections) even influential.  While Maoist </p><p>brutality may succeed in spreading fear, it can only </p><p>undermine rural popular support for the insurgency. </p><p> </p><p>Malinowski </p><p></p></div>
