As solicited in reftel, Post identifies the following </p><p>export priorities for the Honduran government and private </p><p>sector.  The cable includes both non-agricultural products </p><p>(mentioned in reftel) and agricultural goods. </p><p> </p><p>2.  According to its recently published economic plan, the </p><p>Maduro administration will concentrate on developing export </p><p>sectors with high potential to create jobs and related </p><p>economic activity.  This includes strengthening Honduras\' </p><p>existing export capacity in the apparel-assembly and agro- </p><p>industrial sectors and diversifying exports from other light </p><p>industry and agro-industrial enterprises and exploiting </p><p>Honduras\' natural resources (primarily forestry and mining). </p><p> </p><p>3.  Honduras is the largest exporter of textile and apparel </p><p>products to the U.S. among Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership </p><p>Act beneficiary countries and the second largest exporter in </p><p>the region after Mexico.  Industry representatives argue </p><p>that duty free treatment for Honduran exports to the U.S. </p><p>market is essential for the sector to be competitive with </p><p>Asia when import quotas are eliminated in 2005.  Honduras\' </p><p>apparel assembly industry primarily manufactures knit </p><p>apparel and t-shirts.  The Honduran government and </p><p>manufacturing sector are interested in diversifying the </p><p>industry to produce higher-value finished products like </p><p>fashion wear and women\'s attire. </p><p> </p><p>4.  The GOH and industrial park operators are also seeking </p><p>to diversify out of apparel and textile production and into </p><p>other types of light industry, including footwear, </p><p>automotive parts, electronics assembly, data processing </p><p>services and wood furniture and other wood furnishings.  To </p><p>date, there has been limited success in attracting non- </p><p>textile light assembly operations.  Honduras is home to a </p><p>few businesses producing wire harnesses and high-end doors </p><p>and furnishings made from Honduran mahogany for export. </p><p>Recently, a U.S. company manufacturing wire harnesses for </p><p>U.S. automakers announced plans to hire 1,500 new employees. </p><p>The company has also expanded into building high cost mail </p><p>sorters for major U.S. buyers and has plans to expand into </p><p>other high-value assembly operations. </p><p> </p><p>5.  Honduras is a major exporter of coffee, bananas and palm </p><p>oil, which have traditionally been the leading sources of </p><p>foreign exchange.  Falling commodity prices and natural </p><p>disasters have significantly impacted Honduras\' export </p><p>revenues.  In recent years, and thanks in part to the </p><p>Caribbean Basin Initiative, the Honduran government and </p><p>private sector have expanded the agro-industrial export </p><p>sector to include nontraditional agricultural products. </p><p>There is significant investment in Honduras\' melon industry </p><p>(watermelon and cantaloupe) and seafood industry, especially </p><p>for farm-raised and wild shrimp and other seafood products, </p><p>especially spiny-tailed lobster. </p><p> </p><p>6.  USAID has enjoyed success with its agricultural </p><p>diversification program run by FINTRAC, a U.S. company </p><p>working with small farmers to diversify into profitable </p><p>nontraditional agriculture exports (especially oriental </p><p>vegetables and jalapenos).  A USDA-funded hot water </p><p>treatment plant for mangos began operating in April 2002, </p><p>permitting Honduran mango producers for the first time to </p><p>meet U.S. med-fly phytosanitary requirements.  FINTRAC is </p><p>working with Honduran farmers to develop a fledgling papaya </p><p>for export industry.  There is interest in expanding use of </p><p>the mango hot water treatment plant to include papayas </p><p>during the mango-growing season. </p><p> </p><p>7.  USDA has also worked with Honduran cheese producers to </p><p>meet U.S. sanitary restrictions and qualify to export ethnic </p><p>cheese products to the U.S.  Honduran dairy producers are </p><p>interested in increasing exports of ethnic cream to the U.S. </p><p>and beginning exports of soft cheeses (mozzarella). </p><p> </p><p>8.  Other Honduran agricultural export interests include </p><p>poultry products (especially white meat), beef, tobacco </p><p>products (cigars), sugar, herbs and spices (parsely, </p><p>oregano, black pepper, among others), blueberries and </p><p>ornamental plants and flowers.  Honduran exports of poultry </p><p>products, beef, blueberries and spices are restricted </p><p>because they do not meet U.S. phytozoosanitary regulations. </p><p>The Honduran government has also been publicizing the fact </p><p>that Honduras\' North Coast has been declared free of the med- </p><p>fly in order to take advantage of the U.S. market for </p><p>fruits. </p><p> </p><p>Pierce </p><p></p></div>
