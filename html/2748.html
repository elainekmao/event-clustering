<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HANOI 000899 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p> </p><p>SECDEF FOR ABLAGG </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL 04/12/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINR, VM, DPOL </p><p>SUBJECT:  THE NEXT PRIME MINISTER WILL BE . . . </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  CLASSIFIED BY SCOTT BELLARD, POL/C; REASON 1.5(D) </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  00899  01 OF 02  120749Z </p><p>2.  (SBU)  SUMMARY:  DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER NGUYEN TAN DUNG </p><p>IS EXPECTED BY MANY OBSERVERS TO BECOME PRIME MINISTER </p><p>AFTER THE MAY NATIONAL ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS.  TRAN DUOC LUONG </p><p>WILL LIKELY REMAIN PRESIDENT.  TRADE MINISTER VU KHOAN IS </p><p>WIDELY PREDICTED TO BECOME A DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER. </p><p>NATIONAL ASSEMBLY CHAIRMAN NGUYEN VAN AN, WHO ALSO CHAIRS </p><p>THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF VIETNAM (CPV) ORGANIZATION </p><p>COMMISSION, IS SEEN AS THE MOST INFLUENTIAL LEADER ON MANY </p><p>ISSUES, EVEN ECLIPSING PARTY GENERAL SECRETARY NONG DUC </p><p>MANH.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  SENIOR COLONEL TRAN NHUNG, INTERNATIONAL EDITOR </p><p>OF PEOPLE\'S ARMY NEWSPAPER, OUTLINED WHAT HE DEPICTED AS </p><p>PERSONAL VIEWS ON UPCOMING CHANGES IN VIETNAM\'S LEADERSHIP </p><p>DURING AN APRIL 5 MEETING WITH POLOFF.  COLONEL NHUNG </p><p>PREDICTED THAT INCUMBENT PM PHAN VAN KHAI WILL LEAVE OFFICE </p><p>"SOON," BOTH BECAUSE KHAI WANTS TO RETIRE, AND BECAUSE "THE </p><p>PEOPLE" WOULD OPPOSE AN EXTENSION OF HIS TERM.  (NOTE: </p><p>THERE ARE NUMEROUS RUMORS ABOUT UNSAVORY BUSINESS DEALINGS </p><p>BY HIS FAMILY MEMBERS, ESPECIALLY HIS SON.  END NOTE.) </p><p>COLONEL NHUNG EMPHASIZED THAT KHAI WAS SUPPOSED TO RETIRE A </p><p>YEAR AGO, AFTER THE NINTH PARTY CONGRESS. </p><p> </p><p>PRIME MINISTER AND DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  COLONEL NHUNG REVIEWED THREE PROBABLE CANDIDATES </p><p>FOR PRIME MINISTER -- DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER NGUYEN TAN </p><p>DUNG, HO CHI MINH CITY PARTY CHIEF NGUYEN MINH TRIET, AND </p><p>TRADE MINISTER VU KHOAN.  DUNG, A PROTEGE OF FORMER PM VO </p><p>VAN KIET, WILL LIKELY BE THE NEXT PM, COLONEL NHUNG </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00899  01 OF 02  120749Z </p><p>PREDICTED.  HE REMARKED THAT DUNG AND TRIET WERE ALMOST </p><p>IDENTICAL IN POLICY TERMS, BUT THAT TRIET WANTED TO STAY </p><p>WHERE HE IS, AT VIETNAM\'S ECONOMIC CENTER.  YOUNGER, MORE </p><p>OUTWARD-ORIENTED PARTY MEMBERS SUPPORT KHOAN, BUT KHOAN </p><p>DOES NOT YET HAVE ENOUGH SUPPORT AT SENIOR LEVELS TO BECOME </p><p>PM.  KHOAN IS ALSO THE ONLY ONE OF THE THREE NOT ON THE </p><p>POLITBURO.  FURTHERMORE, AS A NORTHERNER, KHOAN WOULD UPSET </p><p>THE REGIONAL BALANCE AMONG THE SRV\'S TOP THREE OFFICES. </p><p>THE PM MUST BE A SOUTHERNER, COLONEL NHUNG CLAIMED, SINCE </p><p>NEITHER GENERAL SECRETARY NONG DUC MANH NOR PRESIDENT TRAN </p><p>DUC LUONG IS APT TO LEAVE OFFICE.  INSTEAD, COLONEL NHUNG </p><p>EXPRESSED THE EXPECTATION THAT VU KHOAN WILL MOVE UP TO ONE </p><p>OF THE FOUR DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER SLOTS, AS HAS BEEN WIDELY </p><p>RUMORED.  (NOTE:  MOST LIKELY, HE WILL TAKE OVER THE </p><p>PORTFOLIO NOW HELD BY NGUYEN MANH CAM.  END NOTE.)  COLONEL </p><p>NHUNG REFUSED TO SPECULATE ABOUT THE OTHER THREE DPM </p><p>POSITIONS.  HE NOTED THAT THE MILITARY AND SECURITY </p><p>APPARATUS IS IN A "WEAK POSITION," WITH ITS LEADERS FACING </p><p>REPLACEMENT AND EXTERNAL THREATS ON THE WANE.  THEREFORE, </p><p>THEY HAVE "LITTLE TO SAY" OVER GOVERNMENT LEADERSHIP, HE </p><p>CLAIMED. </p><p> </p><p>PRESIDENT </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) COLONEL NHUNG DISCOUNTED ANY CHANGE IN THE </p><p>PRESIDENCY.  TRAN DUC LUONG IS NOT HIMSELF INFLUENTIAL AND </p><p>"NO ONE WANTS HIS JOB."  WITH ONLY THE JUDICIARY AND THE </p><p>PROCURACY UNDER HIS PURVIEW, LUONG IS NOT NEARLY AS </p><p>POWERFUL AS HIS PREDECESSOR LE DUC ANH, WHO HELD STRONG </p><p>PARTY POSITIONS AND HAD SWAY OVER THE MFA, THE SECURITY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  00899  01 OF 02  120749Z </p><p>APPARATUS, AND THE MILITARY, COLONEL NHUNG DESCRIBED. </p><p> </p><p>CABINET MINISTERS </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  COLONEL NHUNG PREDICTED REPLACEMENT OF AT LEAST </p><p>HALF OF THE CURRENT CABINET MINISTERS INCLUDING FOREIGN </p><p>AFFAIRS NGUYEN DY NIEN, DEFENSE MINISTER PHAM VAN TRA, </p><p>PUBLIC SECURITY MINISTER LE MINH HUONG, AND PLANNING AND </p><p>INVESTMENT MINISTER TRAN XUAN GIA.  FINANCE MINISTER NGUYEN </p><p>SINH HUNG, EDUCATION AND TRAINING MINISTER NGUYEN MINH </p><p>HIEN, TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATION MINISTER LE NGOC HOAN, </p><p>AND HEALTH MINISTER DO NGUYEN PHUONG WOULD REMAIN, HE SAID. </p><p> </p><p>PARTY LEADERSHIP </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  NGUYEN VAN AN HAS BECOME THE MOST, OR AT LEAST </p><p>SECOND MOST, POWERFUL MAN IN VIETNAM, ACCORDING TO COLONEL </p><p>NHUNG, BECAUSE AS DIRECTOR OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE\'S </p><p>ORGANIZATION COMMISSION FOR TEN YEARS, AN STOCKED CPV RANKS </p><p>WITH HIS SUPPORTERS.  AN ALSO "MAKES STRONG DECISIONS." </p><p>NHUNG PREDICTED THAT AN WOULD EXPAND THE NATIONAL </p><p>ASSEMBLY\'S ROLE AT A FASTER PACE THAN NONG DUC MANH HAD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ1380 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HANOI  00899  02 OF 02  120749Z </p><p>ACTION EAP-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DINT-00  DOEE-00  DOTE-00 </p><p>      SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00    H-01 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00 </p><p>      NSCE-00  OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00 </p><p>      P-00     SP-00    IRM-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00 </p><p>      DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /007W </p><p>                  ------------------8525AE  120750Z /38 </p><p>R 120709Z APR 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HANOI </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 6164 </p><p>INFO SECDEF WASHDC </p><p>ASEAN COLLECTIVE </p><p>AMEMBASSY BEIJING </p><p>USCINCPAC HONOLULU HI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HANOI 000899 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p> </p><p>SECDEF FOR ABLAGG </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DURING HIS TENURE AS CHAIRMAN, BUT THAT AN WOULD STAY IN </p><p>HIS CURRENT POSITION FOR NOW. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  00899  02 OF 02  120749Z </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  THE CPV CHOSE NONG DUC MANH AS A TRANSITIONAL </p><p>LEADER, COLONEL NHUNG ANALYZED, BECAUSE RIVAL FACTIONS </p><p>COULD NOT AGREE BETWEEN TRAN DUC LUONG AND NGUYEN VAN AN. </p><p>(NOTE:  WE DO NOT BELIEVE LUONG WAS TRULY IN THE RUNNING. </p><p>THE REAL RACE WAS PROBABLY AMONG THEN-GENERAL SECRETARY LE </p><p>KHA PHIEU, MANH, AND AN.  END NOTE.)  COLONEL NHUNG </p><p>CONTRASTED MANH WITH AN, CLAIMING THAT MANH COULD NOT MAKE </p><p>STRATEGIC DECISIONS WITHOUT CONSULTING OTHERS.  WHILE </p><p>MANH\'S CONSENSUS-BUILDING SKILLS WERE VALUABLE AS NA </p><p>CHAIRMAN, SUCH AN APPROACH IS "INEFFECTIVE" AS GENERAL </p><p>SECRETARY.  COLONEL NHUNG CRITICIZED THAT MANH CANNOT TAKE </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>THE LEAD, ENFORCE ORDER, OR IMPOSE HIS DECISIONS;  HE HAS </p><p>NO SUPPORT TO DO SO.  COLONEL NHUNG EXPRESSED DOUBT THAT </p><p>MANH WOULD DEVELOP MUCH OR BECOME SUBSTANTIALLY MORE </p><p>EFFECTIVE AS PARTY LEADER.  HE ADDED THAT THE RECENT CPV </p><p>MOVEMENT TOWARDS ALLOWING MEMBERS TO CONTINUE PRIVATE </p><p>BUSINESSES WAS NOT MANH\'S INITIATIVE DESPITE MANH\'S PUBLIC </p><p>CALL THAT THE PARTY CONSIDER CHANGING THE POLICY.  THE </p><p>PROPOSAL ORIGINATED SEVERAL YEARS AGO, BUT WAS OPPOSED, </p><p>COLONEL NHUNG SAID, BY THEN-ADVISORS LE DUC ANH AND DO </p><p>MUOI. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  COLONEL NHUNG CHARACTERIZED THE MOVE TO ALLOW </p><p>PARTY MEMBERS TO CONTINUE IN BUSINESS AS REPRESENTATIVE OF </p><p>THE GROWING INFLUENCE OF YOUNGER -- MORE PRAGMATIC AND </p><p>EDUCATED -- MEMBERS WHO ARE GRADUALLY WINNING OVER THEIR </p><p>ELDERS.  HE SAID ANOTHER SIGN OF THIS GENERATIONAL CHANGE </p><p>IS THE TREND FOR THE CPV TO STEP BACK TO MORE GENERAL </p><p>POLICY GUIDANCE AND ALLOW LAW TO DICTATE SPECIFIC </p><p>DECISIONS.  THE PUBLIC, ACTING THROUGH THE NA, EXPECTS LAWS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00899  02 OF 02  120749Z </p><p>TO SUPPLANT DETAILED PARTY GUIDELINES AND INSTRUCTIONS, </p><p>COLONEL NHUNG CLAIMED. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C)  COMMENT:  WE OFFER COLONEL NHUNG\'S INDIVIDUAL </p><p>VIEWS BECAUSE OF THEIR APPARENTLY FRANK NATURE AND HIS </p><p>ACCESS TO LEADERSHIP CIRCLES GIVEN HIS POSITION.  MUCH CAN </p><p>CHANGE BETWEEN NOW AND THIS SUMMER, ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE </p><p>STAKES INVOLVED IN LEADERSHIP DYNAMICS.  COLONEL NHUNG\'S </p><p>CANDOR WAS STRIKING, BUT NOT UNPRECEDENTED, PARTICULARLY IN </p><p>ONE-ON-ONE DISCUSSIONS.  HE ADMITTED THAT HE WAS NOT </p><p>SUPPOSED TO MEET FOREIGNERS ALONE, BUT THAT HE WAS NOT </p><p>WORRIED ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES BECAUSE HE IS NEARING </p><p>RETIREMENT. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
