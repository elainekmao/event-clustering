<p>UNCLAS ABUJA 001974 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: AORC, EAIR, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA RESPONDS TO U.S. ICAO COUNCIL CANDIDACY </p><p>WITH REQUEST FOR SUPPORT FOR ITS CANDIDACY </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) STATE 131233 (B) ABUJA 983 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Sensitive but Unclassified, please protect accordingly. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) On August 6, Econoff presented Ref A demarche to Mr. </p><p>Kabir Ilyasu, Minister-Counselor, Ministry of Foreign </p><p>Affairs, Second United Nations Division (SUND).  Ilyasu was </p><p>aware of the upcoming International Civil Aviation </p><p>Organization (ICAO) election, and commented that he did not </p><p>believe the U.S. would have any problem with its re-election </p><p>bid as a Category One country. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Ilyasu stated that Nigeria was seeking re-election </p><p>as a Category Two country, and was also requesting support </p><p>for its re-election bid.  Ilyasu indicated that a number of </p><p>countries have expressed support for Nigeria,s candidacy, </p><p>specifically mentioning a positive response from Japan.  When </p><p>Econoff presented Reftel talking points/non-paper, Mr. Ilyasu </p><p>commented that the GON would have preferred "official </p><p>correspondence" in the form of a diplomatic note.  He offered </p><p>that the GON would support the U.S. candidacy, with the </p><p>understanding that the USG would support Nigeria\'s candidacy </p><p>as well.  (Comment.  As was mentioned in Ref B, the GON </p><p>requested USG support in May 2001 for its ICAO Council </p><p>candidate.  End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Econoff thanked the Minister-Counselor for informing </p><p>the USG about Nigeria\'s candidacy as a Category Two country </p><p>and advised that the USG would give Nigeria\'s re-election bid </p><p>full consideration.  However, Econoff made clear that he was </p><p>not in a position to respond to Ilyasu\'s quid pro quo offer. </p><p>Econoff asked if Ilyasu was aware of any countries seeking </p><p>election as a Category Two, which did not presently have that </p><p>status or potentially would as a group representative. </p><p>Ilyasu replied that he believed South Africa was seeking </p><p>election as a Category Two country. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
