<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L RANGOON 000653 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p>CDR USPACOM FOR FPA </p><p>USMISSION NEW YORK FOR AMBASSADOR TWINING </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/04/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, MY, BM </p><p>SUBJECT: RAZALI VISIT TO RANGOON </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 15026 </p><p>     B. KUALA LUMPUR 03417 </p><p>     C. KUALA LUMPUR 03382 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: COM CARMEN MARTINEZ FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary:  Post continues in its conviction that </p><p>Special Envoy (SE) Razali should not come to Rangoon absent </p><p>firm assurances that he will be allowed a meeting with Aung </p><p>San Suu Kyi.  However, we understand that the SE is still </p><p>undecided.  If Razali chooses to come without guarantees of </p><p>any kind (the regime has said quite publicly "it is up to </p><p>him"), then he needs to know that he is expected to stand up </p><p>to Than Shwe and not fold as he did last time.  It is time </p><p>for tough talk, not soft words and ASEAN-style diplomacy. </p><p>This needs to be conveyed to the Special Envoy in a very </p><p>clear and forthright manner.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Post continues in its conviction (in line with </p><p>Department, Ref A) that Special Envoy (SE) Razali should not </p><p>come to Rangoon absent firm assurances that he will be </p><p>allowed a meeting with Aung San Suu Kyi.  However, we </p><p>understand that the SE is still undecided (Ref B) as to his </p><p>course of action and may be considering the scenario outlined </p><p>in para 2, Ref C - coming to Rangoon even if the regime holds </p><p>firm on no ASSK contact.  In this hypothetical scenario </p><p>Razali would arrive June 6 and present a formal request to </p><p>see ASSK.  If the SPDC refuses his request, Razali would </p><p>leave Rangoon immediately, making public the reasons for his </p><p>early departure.  Granted, this might allow the SE more </p><p>options and keep the regime from claiming that Razali, not </p><p>the GOB, had scuttled the visit. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The question mark in this hypothetical scenario is </p><p>Razali\'s resolve in the face of senior general Than Shwe\'s </p><p>intransigent dictatorial style.  It should be remembered that </p><p>on Razali\'s last visit in November 2002, he complied with </p><p>Than Shwe\'s demands that the SE not go to Shan State to meet </p><p>with ASSK on one of her political trips.  It should also be </p><p>recalled that Than Shwe gave the SE a paltry 10-15 minutes of </p><p>his time on the last visit, and there is no indication that </p><p>there will be a more substantive meeting, or any meeting at </p><p>all, this time. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) In addition, Razali\'s mentor Prime Minister Mahatir </p><p>steps down in October 2003 and Razali\'s influence will wane </p><p>in proportion (I posited this idea to the Malaysian </p><p>Ambassador in a meeting with other ASEAN and EU ambassador\'s </p><p>- he agreed that Razali\'s clout is tied to his mentor\'s </p><p>status as Prime Minister).  As Razali has maintained his </p><p>business ties to the regime (his company has the contract for </p><p>the new Burmese passports), and Mahatir\'s clout will be </p><p>waning with the regime, Razali will be wary of really </p><p>confronting Than Shwe and leaving in a manner that would burn </p><p>his bridges behind him. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Comment:  If Razali chooses to come without guarantees </p><p>of any kind (the regime has said quite publicly "it is up to </p><p>him"), then he needs to know that he is expected to stand up </p><p>to Than Shwe and not fold as he did last time (and as PM </p><p>Mahatir did in August of 2002 when he cancelled his visit to </p><p>ASSK because he "wanted to be a good guest").  The </p><p>discouraging developments of the past week have changed the </p><p>focus of the Special Envoy\'s role from that of facilitating a </p><p>political dialogue to making Than Shwe give tangible proof of </p><p>the regime\'s oft-stated commitment to national </p><p>reconciliation.  It is time for tough talk, not soft words </p><p>and ASEAN-style diplomacy.  This needs to be conveyed to the </p><p>Special Envoy in a very clear and forthright manner.  End </p><p>Comment. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
