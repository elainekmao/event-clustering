<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 003441 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/24/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAL, IS, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: LUKE-WARM TO HOSTILE REACTION TO PRESIDENT\'S </p><p>MIDEAST SPEECH </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMBASSADOR EDWARD W. GNEHM FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) A survey of Embassy contacts suggests that President </p><p>Bush\'s June 24 speech received mixed reviews here.  More </p><p>hard-line Palestinian Jordanians charged that the U.S. was in </p><p>"cahoots" with the Israelis to destroy the Palestinian </p><p>resistance, and expressed resentment about "U.S. </p><p>interference" with a "democratically-elected Palestinian </p><p>Government".  More moderate contacts tepidly applauded some </p><p>parts of the speech, but at the same time criticized </p><p>perceived ambiguity in the speech.  Almost all contacts </p><p>expressed concern about the implications for the peace </p><p>process and U.S. engagement if Arafat is re-elected in open, </p><p>fair elections.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>HARD-LINE VIEW: U.S. WANTS A KARZAI FOR PALESTINE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Reaction from the Islamist camp was predictably </p><p>negative.  One Muslim Brotherhood rank and file member called </p><p>the speech, "condescending...the U.S. President is deciding </p><p>how we should liberate our country".  He claimed that the </p><p>"U.S. wants a Karzai for Palestine."  Jamel al-Bakri, an </p><p>Islamic Action Front representative, told the press that Bush </p><p>has sided with the pro-Israeli camp, which will reinforce </p><p>anti-American sentiment in the region.  One press contact who </p><p>visited Bakaa camp--the largest refugee camp in Jordan--on </p><p>June 25 said residents who had viewed the speech saw "no </p><p>difference between the U.S. and Israel".  Several camp </p><p>residents repeated the mantra, "resistance is the only way a </p><p>defenseless people can gain a state from a more powerful </p><p>enemy who has more powerful weapons."  According to camp </p><p>residents, the speech was seen by many as a way for Sharon to </p><p>get out of his present crisis.  Unlike the reaction to the </p><p>President\'s April 4 speech, more hard-line contacts </p><p>criticized the administration\'s lack of concern for the </p><p>Palestinians. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) UNRWA Deputy ComGen Karen Aby Zayd reported to </p><p>Refcoord the negative reaction to the speech among </p><p>Palestinians in Gaza, "...the speech has shifted the onus of </p><p>responsibility from Arafat and the PA to the Palestinian </p><p>people" and "set out conditions that never can be met." </p><p>Several Palestinian contacts complained that the speech "gave </p><p>Sharon everything that he wanted."  One contact said that the </p><p>3-year time table, "will give Sharon enough time to create a </p><p>fait accompli". </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) A group of young Palestinians who were watching the </p><p>speech at a dinner attended by the Ambassador walked out </p><p>several minutes into the speech to protest its content.  A </p><p>group of Palestinian Jordanians who watched the speech with </p><p>PAoff sat through the whole thing, but were shocked and </p><p>dejected by the perceived anti-Palestinian tone and rejection </p><p>of the current PA leadership. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p>MODERATES: END GAME GOOD, BUT HOW DO WE GET THERE? </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Moderate contacts were more balanced in their </p><p>criticism.  Adnan Abu Odeh, former Royal Court advisor, had </p><p>the most positive reaction to the speech, calling it "better </p><p>than the status quo", but he voiced concern about the lack of </p><p>details on how to enforce the speech\'s vision.  He predicted </p><p>that no one in the current environment would oppose Arafat in </p><p>the elections.  He also said that while he interpreted the </p><p>President\'s emphasis on a new PA leadership to mean a change </p><p>in leadership, he opined that the PA is interpreting "new </p><p>leadership" to mean Arafat\'s re-election followed by a </p><p>declaration that there is "new leadership".  Abu Odeh asked </p><p>"then what happens to the Peace Process if Arafat is </p><p>reelected?"  Hani Hourani, head of the Al-Urdun Al-Jadid </p><p>Research Center, also asked about U.S. involvement if Arafat </p><p>was re-elected.  He said the speech contained some positive </p><p>steps for the Palestinians, including the 3-year timeframe </p><p>and the stronger commitment to a Palestinian state based on </p><p>UN resolutions, but warned that the layman, who can\'t read </p><p>between the lines, will view the language as favoring Sharon. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Dr. Mohammad Kheir Mustafa of the Amman Center for </p><p>Peace and Development pointed out that the 3-year timeframe </p><p>is "something beyond the power of the Administration because </p><p>of the coming presidential elections."  Dr. Mustafa, who </p><p>recently hosted a conference with Israelis, Jordanians, and </p><p>an American Jewish group,  also pointed to the discrepancy he </p><p>saw between the increased conditions placed upon the </p><p>Palestinians in the speech and the lack of immediate </p><p>conditions on the Israelis.  He did, however, applaud the </p><p>reference to building Palestinian institutions and improving </p><p>the living conditions of the Palestinians.  Jamal Rifai, a </p><p>Palestinian Jordanian human rights activist, said the speech </p><p>was very fair "in terms of ultimate goals", but the mechanism </p><p>for getting there is not.  He also warned that the continued </p><p>Israeli incursions will ensure that an environment, which </p><p>could support the election of a moderate Palestinian </p><p>leadership, will not develop. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) For many contacts, the June 24 speech raised more </p><p>questions than answers.  Not surprisingly, the President\'s </p><p>references to the need for a Palestinian state, a three-year </p><p>timeline, and an end to "the Israeli occupation that began in </p><p>1967" based on UNSCRs 242 and 338 were well received. </p><p>However, the call for Arafat\'s departure, clear </p><p>terrorism-first sequencing, and vague timeline to reach a </p><p>Palestinian state and an end to occupation garnered the most </p><p>criticism. </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
