<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ZAGREB 001193 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/27/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, HR, Minorities </p><p>SUBJECT: THE SAD STATE OF THE JEWISH COMMUNITY IN OSIJEK </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: POLOFF MITCH BENEDICT FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) ON A RECENT VISIT TO OSIJEK WE STOPPED IN AT THE </p><p>OFFICES OF THE JEWISH COMMUNITY.  DOWN FROM A PRE-WORLD WAR </p><p>    II POPULATION OF OVER 10,000, THERE ARE NOW ONLY 150 JEWS IN </p><p>THE REGION, AND BY STRICT DEFINITION MOST OF THOSE WOULD NOT </p><p>BE CONSIDERED JEWISH.  ELDERLY, POOR IN HEALTH AND RICHES, </p><p>THE COMMUNITY FACES AN UNCERTAIN FUTURE.  HOWEVER, </p><p>RESTITUTION OF PROPERTY COULD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE THEIR </p><p>FINANCIAL STATUS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>THE JEWS OF EASTERN SLAVONIA </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) THE JEWISH COMMUNITY OF OSIJEK (JCO) IS THE </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE ORGANIZATION FOR ALL JEWS OF EASTERN SLAVONIA. </p><p> PRIOR TO WORLD WAR II, THIS REGION CONTAINED ABOUT 10,000 </p><p>JEWS THAT WERE DIVIDED INTO SEVERAL COMMUNITIES.  JEWS BEGAN </p><p>TO LEAVE JUST PRIOR TO THE WAR; THOSE WHO REMAINED WERE </p><p>DECIMATED BY THE HOLOCAUST.  FURTHER EMIGRATION OCCURRED IN </p><p>1948-1952, WHEN THE CONSOLIDATION OF COMMUNISM AT HOME </p><p>COINCIDED WITH THE BIRTH OF ISRAEL. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) TODAY THERE ARE BARELY 150 JEWS IN THE WHOLE REGION. </p><p>DARKO FISHER, HEAD OF THE JCO, SAID THAT OUTSIDE OSIJEK AND </p><p>VUKOVAR THERE ARE ONLY SINGLE FAMILIES IN SOME OF THE LARGER </p><p>TOWNS.  HOWEVER, BY STRICT CRITERIA MOST OF MEMBERS OF THE </p><p>JCO COULD NOT BE COUNTED AS JEWS.  FISHER SAID AS LONG AS ONE </p><p>GRANDPARENT WAS JEWISH, AND THE INDIVIDUAL HOLDS NO OTHER </p><p>RELIGIOUS AFFILIATION, THEY ARE WELCOME AS MEMBERS OF THE </p><p>JEWISH COMMUNITY. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) THERE ARE LESS THAN 10 YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY, </p><p>AND ALL OF THEM COME FROM MIXED MARRIAGES.  FISHER TOLD US </p><p>THAT, GIVEN THE RESTRICTIONS PLACED ON RELIGIOUS EDUCATION, </p><p>    AND THE IMPOSSIBILITY AT TIMES OF PRACTICING AND MAINTAINING </p><p>RITUALS AND TRADITIONS, NO JEW BORN IN THE AREA EVEN PRIOR TO </p><p>WORLD WAR II KNOWS WHAT IT MEANS TO BE AN OBSERVANT JEW.  THE </p><p>PRIMARY CONCERNS OF THE JCO ARE FOR THE HEALTH AND WELFARE OF </p><p>ITS MOSTLY ELDERLY, IMPOVERISHED AND ILL MEMBERS. </p><p> </p><p>PROPERTY RESTITUTION </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) THE JCO SUBMITTED A LIST OF 14 CONFISCATED OR </p><p>NATIONALIZED PROPERTIES FOR WHICH THEY CLAIM RESTITUTION </p><p>PRIOR TO THE DEADLINE OF JUNE 30, 1997.  TO DATE NOTHING HAS </p><p>BEEN RESTITUTED.  FISHER WAS MORE THAN WILLING TO SHARE THE </p><p>BLAME FOR LACK OF PROGRESS, BUT ON THE OTHER HAND HE SAID HE </p><p>HAD NO DOUBT THERE WAS "SOME BLOCKAGE" ON THE PART OF THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT.  RETURN OR COMPENSATION FOR EVEN A FEW PROPERTIES </p><p>WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY ALTER THE FINANCIAL STATUS OF THE </p><p>COMMUNITY. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) INCLUDED AMONG THE PROPERTIES IS THE SITE OF FORMER </p><p>OSIJEK SYNAGOGUE ON THE MAIN STREET IN THE CENTER OF OSIJEK. </p><p>THE SYNAGOGUE WAS BURNED DOWN IN 1941, AND THE REMAINS WERE </p><p>CLEARED IN 1952.  AT ABOUT THE SAME TIME, THE JCO WAS GIVEN </p><p>AN ALTERNATIVE PROPERTY AS A FORM OF COMPENSATION, BUT THAT </p><p>TOO WAS CONFISCATED IN 1955.  A MIXED COMMERCIAL/RESIDENTIAL </p><p>BUILDING OCCUPIES THE SITE OF THE SYNAGOGUE TODAY.  THE </p><p>THIRTEEN REMAINING PROPERTIES CONSIST OF BUILDINGS AND </p><p>RESIDENCES -- THE RABBI\'S HOUSE, A SCHOOL, OTHER PROPERTY </p><p>RELATED TO THE SYNAGOGUE -- EITHER PURCHASED BY THE JCO OR </p><p>WILLED TO THE JCO BY MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY. </p><p> </p><p>    7. (C) FISHER SAID THE COURTS DON\'T KNOW WHAT TO DO, AND </p><p>CONSEQUENTLY DO NOTHING.  SINCE 1997 THEY HAVE RECEIVED ONLY </p><p>ONE COURT DECISION ASKING FOR FURTHER DOCUMENTATION TO PROVE </p><p>OWNERSHIP.  HOWEVER, HE ASKED RHETORICALLY, IS THERE EVER </p><p>GOING TO BE A DOCUMENT THAT PROVES THE PROPERTY WAS </p><p>CONFISCATED BY THE NAZI REGIME? </p><p>ROSSIN </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p></p></div>
