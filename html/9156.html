<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 KUWAIT 002957 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR INR/R/MR, NEA/ARP, NEA/PPD, PA, INR/NESA, </p><p>IIP/G/NEA-SA, INR/B </p><p>WHITE HOUSE FOR PRESS OFFICE </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH, PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p>SECDEF FOR OASD/PA </p><p>CINCCENT FOR CCPA </p><p>USDOC FOR 4520/ANESA/ONE/FITZGERALD-WILKS </p><p>USDOC FOR ITA AND PTO/OLIA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KU, KDMR </p><p>SUBJECT: KUWAIT MEDIA REACTION, JULY 1-2: PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>ELECTION; IRAQ; ATTACKS ON US FORCES </p><p> </p><p>1.   SUMMARY: The parliamentary elections to be held on July </p><p>5 dominate the news pages. One candidate believes that </p><p>"embassies buy individuals and have pushed them to run in </p><p>the election to serve their interests," while an Islamist </p><p>candidate rails against "secularists trying to tamper with </p><p>our educational curricula." In his session closing remarks, </p><p>National Assembly Speaker Jassem Al-Kharafi stressed the </p><p>need for continued reform and "fast and daring decisions" to </p><p>confront the "economic and security challenges" facing </p><p>Kuwait. </p><p> </p><p>Commentators opine on the recent series of attacks on US </p><p>troops in Iraq, with one believing the attacks to be a </p><p>manifestation of general Arab hostility towards America, </p><p>while another feels their importance should not be </p><p>exaggerated as they represent "sabotage and not resistance." </p><p>One writer argues that the US did not enter Afghanistan and </p><p>Iraq for the betterment of their peoples but rather to </p><p>"cement Zionist military superiority." Another finds the </p><p>idea of donations to the families of coalition forces killed </p><p>in Iraq "immoral." END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.   News Stories: National Assembly Speaker Jassem Al- </p><p>Kharafi stated in his speech at the last session of the </p><p>Assembly before the July 5 parliamentary elections that </p><p>Kuwait is facing "security and economic challenges that need </p><p>to be addressed by fast and daring decisions and deepening </p><p>efforts for reform in the state and the society," Al-Qabas </p><p>reports on its July 2 front page. </p><p> </p><p>Al-Rai Al-Aam reports on its July 1st front page that the </p><p>conservative Islamist Salafi Movement are concerned that too </p><p>many Islamist candidates may divide the vote and have </p><p>negative effects on Islamist representation in the new </p><p>National Assembly. </p><p> </p><p>Al-Qabas reports comments by National Assembly candidate </p><p>Abdullah Al-Rejaib saying that, "embassies buy individuals </p><p>and have pushed them to run in the election to serve their </p><p>interests."  Al-Watan reports that one Islamist National </p><p>Assembly candidate has declared: "Secularists are trying to </p><p>tamper with our educational curricula and we have to stand </p><p>up against their Westernized objectives." </p><p> </p><p>Al-Qabas reports that a Congressional delegation led by </p><p>Senator John Warner visiting Kuwait and Iraq "hailed </p><p>Kuwait\'s role in the liberation of Iraq." </p><p> </p><p>Editorials: </p><p> </p><p>3.  "When Morals Disappear" </p><p>Dr. Yaser Al-Saleh wrote in independent Al-Rai Al-Aam </p><p>(7/01):  "[T]he majority of Arabs believe the main reason </p><p>behind the American invasion of Iraq, is to control Iraq\'s </p><p>oil and thus accomplish the goals of the Zionist entity. </p><p>This spirit of hostility also manifests itself in Iraq where </p><p>resistance operations against the coalition forces are </p><p>carried out on daily basis. Despite this, some here refer to </p><p>[the coalition forces] as the forces of liberation, to the </p><p>extent of collecting money for the families of the occupying </p><p>forces killed in Iraq instead of spending on the needy here. </p><p>What morals!" </p><p> </p><p>4.  "In the Right Direction" </p><p>Dr. Yacoub Al-Sharrah wrote in independent Al-Rai Al-Aam </p><p>(7/01):  "We call on the Iraqis to embrace this golden </p><p>opportunity offered to them by the coalition, to build a new </p><p>democratic nucleus so that Iraq may rapidly join the </p><p>international community. It is a sensible state which </p><p>protects the interests of its people by following a wise and </p><p>even-minded policy and does not take the path of </p><p>confrontation and destructive challenge which eventually </p><p>leads nowhere." </p><p> </p><p>5. "History is not a Tea Party" </p><p>Dr. Abdullah Al-Nafisi wrote in independent Al-Watan (7/02): </p><p>"It is wrong to believe that the United States or the West </p><p>came to Kabul or Baghdad to turn us from defeat to victory, </p><p>backwardness to progress, and stagnation to development. The </p><p>Western coalition is keen to cement Zionist military </p><p>superiority, supplying them with WMD, at the same time </p><p>stripping Arabs of such weapons and accusing them of being a </p><p>threat to world peace, as events in Iraq have shown." </p><p> </p><p>6.  "Sabotage and Not Resistance" </p><p>Pan-Arabist editor-in-chief Ahmed Al-Jarallah wrote in </p><p>independent Al-Seyassah (7/02):  "There is no need to </p><p>exaggerate armed attacks against America troops in Iraq. </p><p>The situation is similar to events taking place in </p><p>Afghanistan, where [Baathist] remnant groups attempt to </p><p>prove themselves through desperate attacks. Iraq will not be </p><p>another Somalia for Americans. These remnants seek to delay </p><p>the course of reconstruction and development in Iraq.  Those </p><p>who obstruct the reconstruction program by the United States </p><p>will soon realize that Americans are capable of uprooting </p><p>these groups." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
