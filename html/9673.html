Maoist leaders responded to the Government of Nepal\'s </p><p>(GON) invitation to sit for a third round of talks by </p><p>issuing more demands as a prerequisite to dialogue </p><p>(Reftel).  The GON maintains that the peace process is not </p><p>in jeopardy, but senior Maoist leaders increasingly talk of </p><p>notably absent from Kathmandu amid reports of their </p><p>attendance at a regional conference in India of the </p><p>Revolutionary Internationalist Movement (RIM). The Indian </p><p>Ambassador to Nepal acknowledged to reporters on July 25 </p><p>that there was cooperation between Maoists in Nepal and </p><p>terrorist groups in India.  Security forces reportedly have </p><p>been put on high alert amid concern over increasing Maoist </p><p>activities, and the possible failure of peace talks, which </p><p>a high-ranking police official was quoted as saying would </p><p>result in "colossal casualties."   A female Maoist was shot </p><p>to death on July 25 during a confrontation with security </p><p>forces. </p><p> </p><p>2.  Summary continued.  International donor agencies have </p><p>expressed concern that the Maoists will resume hostilities, </p><p>causing essential development projects to be halted. </p><p>Maoist extortion demands to the United Mission to Nepal </p><p>(UMN), an umbrella organization of inter-faith </p><p>professionals providing medical assistance and development </p><p>projects, has caused programs to be shut down.  The </p><p>Industrial Security Group (ISG) issued a statement on July </p><p>21 demanding an immediate end to extortion by the Maoists. </p><p>Citing GON harassment, the Maoists closed down their </p><p>Kathmandu contact office.  Maoists continue to extort money </p><p>from civilians and businesses, and reportedly murdered a </p><p>retired policeman in the eastern district of Ilam after he </p><p>refused to donate money and food to them.  Maoists abducted </p><p>thirteen civilians in four separate districts over a five- </p><p>day period.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>MAOISTS ISSUE MORE PRECONDITIONS FOR FURTHER PEACE TALKS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  In response to the GON\'s formal invitation to sit for a </p><p>third round of talks (Reftel), Maoist leaders declared </p><p>there is no reason to continue peace negotiations until the </p><p>GON immediately implements agreements allegedly reached </p><p>during the second round of talks.  These agreements include </p><p>the controversial issue of restricting the Royal Nepal Army </p><p>(RNA) to within five kilometers of its barracks, the </p><p>release of senior Maoist leaders, and publication of the </p><p>whereabouts of missing Maoist cadres.  In a statement </p><p>issued through peace talks facilitators on July 23, Baburam </p><p>Bhattarai, head of the Maoist negotiating team, said the </p><p>non-implementation of those alleged agreements is </p><p>"tantamount to the unilateral end of the ceasefire and </p><p>peace dialogue."  Bhattarai reportedly also demanded that </p><p>the King play a direct role in the talks, or provide a </p><p>public statement authorizing full authority to the GON\'s </p><p>negotiating team, which Bhattarai lambasted as "powerless </p><p>and helpless." </p><p>4.  In their response Maoists continued their rhetoric </p><p>against the USG and the RNA, demanding the "immediate </p><p>expulsion of all U.S. military advisors and experts" as a </p><p>prerequisite for continued dialogue.  In a scathing </p><p>criticism, Maoists accused the RNA of turn ng itself into </p><p>the "Royal American Army," and alleged the establishment of </p><p>a "foreign puppet military regime." </p><p>5.  Kamal Thapa, Minister of Information and Communication, </p><p>and head of the GON\'s negotiating team, confirmed that the </p><p>GON had received the Maoists\' response, and that it would </p><p>be studied very carefully.  Minister Thapa indicated that </p><p>the talks might be delayed because the Maoist demands are </p><p>"every tough."  The GON is expected to issue a reply within </p><p>the next few days. </p><p> </p><p>CONFLICTING MESSAGES </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  The Maoist refusal to sit for another round of talks, </p><p>which the GON has continually promised would be held soon, </p><p>illustrates the very different perceptions of the peace </p><p>process held by the two sides.  Minister Thapa, who has </p><p>consistently maintained the GON\'s commitment to the peace </p><p>process, said on July 22 that "there is no obstructions" to </p><p>a third round of talks, and that the GON had maintained </p><p>"maximum flexibility" during the six-month ceasefire. </p><p>Thapa cited six informal talks with the Maoists as proof </p><p>that the peace process has not been derailed, and said the </p><p>GON was determined to hold talks "at any cost." </p><p> </p><p>7.  Senior Maoist leaders, however, seem to have a </p><p>different view of the direction of the talks.  Ram Bahadur </p><p>Thapa (Badal), Maoist military chief and negotiating team </p><p>member, declared on July 18 that a third round of talks was </p><p>"impossible" unless the RNA\'s movements were restricted. </p><p>Maoist rhetoric has increasingly referenced a return to the </p><p>jungle and a "decisive war" if peace talks fail. </p><p> </p><p>MAOISTS MEET REVOLUTIONARY GROUP IN INDIA </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  On July 14 senior-level Maoists reportedly attended the </p><p>regional conference of the Revolutionary Internationalist </p><p>Movement (RIM) held for the first time somewhere in the </p><p>bred areas (Maoist controlled) of India, including the </p><p>states of Bihar, Chattisgarh, Orrissa and Jharkhand. </p><p>Pushpa Kamal Dahal (Prachanda), Maoist Chairman, and </p><p>Baburam Bhattarai reportedly attended along with Dev </p><p>Gurung, senior Maoist and negotiating team member.  Other </p><p>groups from India and Bangladesh.  The conference hailed </p><p>the Maoist-led peoples\' wars in Nepal, Peru, India, Turkey </p><p>and the Philippines, and praised the advances made against </p><p>alleged American imperialism and Indian expansionism.  A </p><p>statement released at the conclusion of the RIM meeting </p><p>said the Maoist-led wars are the "beginning of a </p><p>proletariat movement in the world." (Note:  The continued </p><p>absence of senior Maoist leaders in recent weeks has fueled </p><p>speculation that they have gone underground in India, </p><p>meeting with various organizations to garnet support.  End </p><p>note). </p><p> </p><p>9.  Shyam Sharan, the Indian Ambassador to Nepal, told </p><p>reporters on July 25 that his government will not allow </p><p>anti-Nepal activity on its soil.  Ambassador Sharan </p><p>acknowledged there was cooperation between Maoists in Nepal </p><p>and terrorist groups in India, declaring that "we know that </p><p>the Maoists were working together in drawing action plans </p><p>with terrorist organizations" in Bihar, Andhra Pradesh and </p><p>Orissa.  He said in order to take effective action against </p><p>the Maoists, a better exchange of information between the </p><p>two governments was needed. </p><p> </p><p>10.  In addition to traveling to India, Pushpa Kamal Dahal </p><p>(Prachanda), Maoist Chairman, reportedly has been meeting </p><p>with various ethnic groups in Nepal.  Even before returning </p><p>to India, Prachanda reportedly attended a rally of the </p><p>"Tharu Liberation Front," a tribal organization </p><p>concentrated in the southern lowlands.  According to the </p><p>Kirant National Front (KNF), a Maoist affiliated ethnic </p><p>political organization, Pracha </p><p>nda subsequently inaugurated </p><p>the group\'s first national convention, and reportedly </p><p>declared that the strategy for the next phase of the </p><p>insurgency in Nepal would be different.  Speculation </p><p>persists that the Maoist Chairman is attempting to stir up </p><p>ethnic revolutionary fervor.  On July 23 it was announced </p><p>that the KNF had merged with the Kirant Workers\' Party to </p><p>form the Unified Kirant Front, and then promptly demanded </p><p>"Kirant autonomy" in the eastern part of Nepal. </p><p> </p><p>SECURITY INCREASED </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>11.  A female Maoist was shot to death on July 25 during a </p><p>confrontation with security forces in the far western </p><p>district of Kalikot.  A joint team of army and police </p><p>personnel were on routine patrol when Maoists allegedly </p><p>attacked them.  Colonel Dipak Gurung, RNA spokesman, said </p><p>his forces had to return fire in self-defense, and </p><p>condemned the attack as "a serious violations" of the </p><p>over increasing Maoist activities.  The local press quoted </p><p>an unnamed government official on July 23 as saying that </p><p>the GON has ordered all security personnel on leave to </p><p>return to their bases.  Security personnel reportedly have </p><p>been told also to monitor and, if necessary, restrict the </p><p>purchases of pressure cookers and iron pipes, items used </p><p>extensively in the past by Maoists to make bombs. </p><p> </p><p>12.  Security reportedly has been increased also in the </p><p>Kathmandu Valley and in the western region of Nepal, </p><p>particularly after the closure of the Maoists\' office in </p><p>the capital.  Joint teams of army and police personnel have </p><p>intensified patrols and security checkpoints in the </p><p>districts of Rolpa, where Maoists reportedly have continued </p><p>to extort and abduct, as well as Doti and Dang, a Maoist </p><p>stronghold.  A Maoist program scheduled for July 21 in Dang </p><p>was banned by local officials, who cited security concerns. </p><p>In response to reports of increased Maoist activities in </p><p>Dipayal District, security personnel have imposed curfews, </p><p>resumed checkpoints and resorted to frisking of travelers. </p><p>Security personnel said they are following orders from </p><p>their high command.  Many of the villagers, fearing a </p><p>resumption of hostilities, have fled. </p><p> </p><p>13.  A high-ranking police official was quoted in the local </p><p>press on July 21 as saying that the Maoists have increased </p><p>their military strength and could possibly switch tactics, </p><p>targeting urban areas and district headquarters instead of </p><p>returning to the jungle.  The official warned that the </p><p>Maoists would target urban areas "to meet their financial </p><p>needs," and that if the peace talks failed it would result </p><p>in "colossal casualties." </p><p> </p><p>14.  According to reports, Nepal Electric Authority (NEA) </p><p>has handed over security of major power projects to the </p><p>RNA.  The RNA has been responsible for the security of </p><p>several power plants since the Maoists destroyed nine of </p><p>them during the declared state of emergency last year. </p><p> </p><p>INTERNATIONAL DONORS CONCERNED OVER STALLED PEACE TALKS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p> </p><p>15.  As the peace negotiations remain stalled, </p><p>international donor agencies have expressed concern that </p><p>the Maoists will resume hostilities.  On July 21 David </p><p>Wood, head of DFID Nepal, the British Government agency for </p><p>international development, declared that it was essential </p><p>for Nepal to sustain the peace process, noting that peace </p><p>"is a prerequisite for progress."  He said the possibility </p><p>that the Maoists will return to violence is "extremely </p><p>worrying." </p><p> </p><p>16.  Henning Karcher, resident representative of the United </p><p>Nations Development Program (UNDP), echoed the need for </p><p>peace before development projects could be successful, </p><p>saying that progress could not be achieved in developing </p><p>Nepal "unless the conflict is resolved."  Karcher also </p><p>reiterated the need for a human rights accord.  On July 19, </p><p>the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) again condemned </p><p>both the GON and the Maoists for failing to respond to its </p><p>draft of a human rights accord. </p><p> </p><p>MAOISTS EXTORTING FROM DEVELOPME </p><p>NT AGENCIES </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>17.  Maoists in the western district of Dailekh reportedly </p><p>threatened violence against a development agency if it did </p><p>not pay them USD 4000.  The United Mission to Nepal (UMN), </p><p>an umbrella organization of inter-faith professionals </p><p>providing medical and development assistance, was warned by </p><p>the insurgents to leave the district unless payment was </p><p>made.  Maoists had forced the UMN to suspend all its </p><p>projects two years ago after the insurgents looted supplies </p><p>and disrupted programs, but the organization later resumed </p><p>its projects, which include humanitarian assistance and </p><p>infrastructure development.  An official of the UMN told </p><p>the local press on July 24 that it has decided to shut down </p><p>again because it cannot meet the extortion demand.  The </p><p>organization includes seventy-five American volunteers and </p><p>employs over two hundred local youths. </p><p> </p><p>18.  Extortion demands by the insurgents have caused bus </p><p>service to stop completely in some parts of the western </p><p>district of Surkhet.  Due to increasing demands for </p><p>donations from bus drivers, the Mid-Western Bus </p><p>Entrepreneurs Association has stopped service along some </p><p>routes.  The insurgents reportedly wanted a "donation" of </p><p>almost USD 350 from each bus. </p><p> </p><p>ISG DEMANDS END TO EXTORTION </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>19.  A statement issued on July 21 by the Industrial </p><p>Security Group (ISG), consisting of bilateral Chambers of </p><p>Commerce and representatives of the U.S., British, Indian, </p><p>German and French embassies, called for an immediate end to </p><p>extortion by the Maoists.  The ISG also called upon the GON </p><p>to address the numerous violations of the code of conduct </p><p>committed by the insurgents at the next round of peace </p><p>negotiations.  In addition to extortion, which has </p><p>increased substantially since the ceasefire was declared, </p><p>the statement also cites Maoist interference with </p><p>MAOISTS CLOSE KATHMANDU OFFICE </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>20.  Maoists closed their office in Kathmandu on July 20, </p><p>alleging that it was under the "constant watch of the </p><p>government\'s security forces."  The move follows the </p><p>detention of Bharat Dhungana, head of the office, by </p><p>security forces on July 17.  Dhungana claimed that he was </p><p>handcuffed and held for five hours.  In a statement </p><p>released by Dhungana on July 21, he accused the GON of </p><p>keeping him and the office under twenty-four-hour </p><p>surveillance, and criticized the GON for failing to </p><p>guarantee the security of the office.  The insurgents have </p><p>demanded a public apology from the GON before they would </p><p>reopen the office. </p><p> </p><p>21.  Kamal Thapa, Minister of Information and </p><p>Communications, and member of the GON\'s peace talks team, </p><p>said the GON was "shocked" that the Maoists had closed the </p><p>office, but refuted the accusations of Dhungana, saying </p><p>that the GON consistently has assured the security of </p><p>Maoist cadres, and "promised to work to strengthen security </p><p>if there are flaws." Minister Thapa dismissed the closing </p><p>of the office as a "pressure tactics" by the insurgents, and </p><p>said security forces took Dhungana in for questioning after </p><p>he was implicated in extortion campaigns. </p><p> </p><p>BADAL JUSTIFIES CODE OF CONDUCT VIOLATIONS </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>22.  In an interview with the Nepali press on July 17, </p><p>Badal, Maoist military chief, denied that Maoist cadres </p><p>were violating the code of conduct.  Badal refuted charges </p><p>of abducting civilians, saying that the Maoists have only </p><p>taken action against "fake Maoists," and accused members of </p><p>the Communist Party of Nepal-United Marxist Leninist (CPN- </p><p>UML) of pretending to be Maoists in order to "tarnish our </p><p>image."  Badal admitted taking money from people, but </p><p>insisted that it was given voluntarily.  The military chief </p><p>defiantly declared that the Maoists have laid down arms but </p><p>not given them up, and warned the RNA that it would be a </p><p>mistake to think the Maoists would relinquish their </p><p>weapons. </p><p> </p><p>MAOISTS MURDER RETIRED </p><p> COP </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>23.  On July 18 a group of Maoists reportedly murdered a </p><p>retired policeman in the eastern district of Ilam after he </p><p>refused to donate money and food to the insurgents. </p><p>Ministry issued a statement on July 18 condemning the </p><p>murder, and warning that such incidents could adversely </p><p>affect peace talks.  On July 20 a group of insurgents in </p><p>Parsa District reportedly threatened to kill a Nepali </p><p>Congress (NC) activist if he does not provide them with </p><p>weapons, ammunition and cash.  On that same day in Bara </p><p>District, Maoist cadres stole weapons and ammunition from </p><p>three separate homes. </p><p> </p><p>24.  Maoists abducted thirteen civilians in four separate </p><p>districts over a five-day period.  On July 19 six people, </p><p>including a two-year old child, were abducted by Maoists in </p><p>the northeastern district of Sankhuwasabha.  Their </p><p>whereabouts remain unknown.  On July 20 a twenty-two year </p><p>old man was abducted from his home in southeastern </p><p>Mahottari District, and a former Village Development </p><p>Committee (VDC) chairman and CPN-UML activist was taken </p><p>from his home in the northwestern region of Humla.  In the </p><p>western district of Baglung six people were abducted on </p><p>July 24 by a group of armed Maoists. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
