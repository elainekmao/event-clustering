Lula\'s GoB is set to tackle the abysmal fiscal problem of </p><p>Brazil\'s pension system (current budget drain: five-plus </p><p>percent of GDP.)  Of that system\'s total deficit in 2002, its </p><p>three million public-sector pensioners accounted for Rs 53 </p><p>billion; its 20.8 million private sector retirees for just Rs </p><p>18 billion.  The incoming GoB\'s plan, outlined by long-time </p><p>Lula confidant Luiz Gushiken, hinges on: (i) unifying the </p><p>private- and public-sector pension systems for all future </p><p>entrants to Brazil\'s workforce; and (ii) limiting all pensions </p><p>to a common eventual ceiling.  This means deep future slashes </p><p>in public-sector pensions.  With these goals, Lula\'s </p><p>administration is turning its back on PT history.  Throughout </p><p>Cardoso\'s presidency, the PT opposed attempts to reform the </p><p>pension system, especially the notion of public-sector pensions </p><p>being anything less than "integral" (100% of final salary). </p><p> </p><p>2.  Pushing these policies now will mean a huge fight with </p><p>Brazil\'s entrenched public sector.  And these days the PT\'s </p><p>membership is said to be as -- or more -- numerous amongst mid- </p><p>to-lower level government functionaries as amongst factory </p><p>workers.  Thus, pension reform represents a big early choice </p><p>for Lula between past trade-union loyalties and current fiscal </p><p>exigency.  Even if successful, it would not start to accrue big </p><p>GoB budget savings for years.  Yet in terms of keeping Brazil\'s </p><p>sovereign debt sustainable, GoB pension reform in 2003 can </p><p>reasonably be seen by the longer-sighted component of \'the </p><p>market\' as no less crucial than ongoing GoB primary surpluses. </p><p>END SUMMARY AND COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>Nature of Problem: Maharajahs and A Fiscal Crater </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>3.  Even in advance of Lula\'s December 20 designation of PT Sao </p><p>Paulo Deputy Ricardo Berzoini (PT-SP) to head "Previdencia" </p><p>(Social Security Administration equivalent), the incoming GoB </p><p>was leaving little doubt that it has resolved to tackle </p><p>Brazil\'s infamous pension-system fiscal problem.  Tax reform </p><p>was Lula\'s earliest declared legislative priority for the new </p><p>Congress, but all his most senior PT aides (Palocci, Dirceu, </p><p>Genoino, Mercadante, Genro) now publicly chorus that </p><p>Previdencia\'s overhaul is the vital pre-condition for salvaging </p><p>the GoB\'s fiscal situation in the medium-to-long run.  During </p><p>and since Lula\'s inauguration, the GoB drumbeat on the theme </p><p>has intensified.  "Without fixing Previdencia, no other budget </p><p>issue will be solved," Finance Minister Palocci has summed up, </p><p>and he highlighted the issue both to USTR Zoellick on January 1 </p><p>and in his speech at the January 2 ceremony when taking over </p><p>the Finance Ministry sash. </p><p> </p><p>4.  As well he might.  The consolidated Brazilian government\'s </p><p>current annual mismatch between Previdencia receipts and </p><p>outlays is a robust 70-plus billion Reals ($20-plus billion.) </p><p>That exceeds five percent of GDP.  It is one-sixth of gross tax </p><p>revenues.  For comparison: in 2001, Brazil\'s federal government </p><p>spent a total of Rs 44 billion on all its health, education and </p><p>security programs, and total federal investment was under Rs 8 </p><p>(eight) billion (admittedly not including state companies like </p><p>Petrobras).  Separate out pensions, and Brazil would be running </p><p>not just a primary but also a nominal budget surplus, even </p><p>while paying more than 8 percent of GDP in interest yearly. </p><p>5.  This fiscal crater was dug by Brazil\'s public-sector </p><p>pensioners.  The latter number some three million, from </p><p>Brazil\'s federal government plus those of its 26 states and </p><p>5,500 municipalities.  They all get an "integral" pension, </p><p>i.e., equal to their top lifetime salary (more, in some cases), </p><p>paid out of the budget of the corresponding government level. </p><p>Nor is there any ceiling to these public-sector pensions. </p><p>Public employees began paying into their own pension fund only </p><p>after 1992; they now have just 11% of salary deducted. </p><p> </p><p>6.  Brazil\'s 20.8 million private-sector retirees under the </p><p>national social-security scheme (INSS) also pay up to 11% of </p><p>their salaries on a sliding scale on the first Rs 1,561 of </p><p>their monthly salaries.  But their employers must pay INSS an </p><p>extra 20% of payroll as extra contribution towards the whole </p><p>Previdencia system.  (That in turn helps depress the ratio of </p><p>Brazil\'s working population with "carteira assinada," i.e., </p><p>working on the books as part of the formal, tax-paying economy, </p><p>to an estimated 45-50% -- a further problem.)  Private-sector </p><p>workers wind up with a mere fraction of their salaries as </p><p>pension, computed via a complex formula based on years worked, </p><p>remaining life expectancy, lifetime average salary, et al.  And </p><p>they max out at just Rs 1,561 (ten so-called \'reference minimum </p><p>salaries\') per month. </p><p> </p><p>7.  Bottom line:  Previdencia\'s total yearly deficit for the </p><p>consolidated Brazilian government in 2002 was Rs 70-plus </p><p>billion ($20-plus billion), i.e., 5.2% of GDP, roughly two- </p><p>thirds in the Federal budget, and the rest in states\' and </p><p>municipalities\'.  Of this total, Rs 53 billion was spent on </p><p>public-sector retirees, and just Rs 18 billion on private- </p><p>sector ones.  According to the GoB\'s own computations, each </p><p>public-sector retiree costs the budget Rs 14,590 per year, vs. </p><p>Rs 656 (sic) per private-sector retiree. </p><p> </p><p>8.  The disparity further narrows down to 600,000-900,000 of </p><p>Brazil\'s best-paid civil servants, its so-called "maharajahs." </p><p>Even under the current system, according to one analysis, 80% </p><p>of public-sector retirees are due pensions beneath the private- </p><p>sector cap of Rs 1,560.  It is thus the remaining 20% -- i.e., </p><p>one in perhaps thirty Brazilian pensioners -- who make off with </p><p>most of the gravy.  Most egregiously, these "maharajahs" are </p><p>concentrated in the legislature and Justice Ministry, where the </p><p>medium salary is reputedly Rs 5,500.  Their reported average </p><p>monthly pension is Rs 8,000. </p><p> </p><p>Past Reform Efforts:  FHC\'s Failure </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>9.  Former president Cardoso launched a constitutional </p><p>amendment for Previdencia reform at the outset of his first </p><p>term in 1995.  Eight years later, supporters claim FHC was </p><p>largely successful in containing costs on the private-pension </p><p>(INSS) side, but concede that results on the public-sector side </p><p>were marginal.  FHC did raise the standard required length of </p><p>service to 30 and 25 years, respectively, for men and women. </p><p>He also introduced the principle of longevity not just of work </p><p>but of payments into the Previdencia system as the basis for </p><p>pension eligibility. </p><p> </p><p>10.  The closest FHC came to a breakthrough was in 1998, when a </p><p>majority in Congress approved a bill that inter alia raised </p><p>public servants\' contribution to Previdencia from 11 to 25% of </p><p>salary on a sliding scale, and introduced (at IMF insistence) </p><p>the principle that retirees also pay towards the system.  A </p><p>preliminary Supreme Court injunction, however, then declared </p><p>such measures to be "confiscatory" and thus to require approval </p><p>by a three-fifths legislative vote under the constitution.  The </p><p>Court\'s final decision on the subject is still pending. </p><p> </p><p>11.  Thereafter, FHC\'s pension-reform efforts subsided.  True, </p><p>his GoB finally procured its constitutional amendment in 1998. </p><p>But that amendment only passed after being stripped of its </p><p>reform teeth on the public-pension side.  As with the general </p><p>fiscal-reform inertia of FHC\'s second term, a prime cause was </p><p>that he had traded too many legislative chips to obtain the </p><p>constitutional amendment which let him be re-elected.  Yet the </p><p>outgoing GoB can also rightly charge that the PT then opposed </p><p>and blocked pension reform at every turn. </p><p> </p><p>PT\'s About-Face, Pension-Reform Premises </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>12. So the new GoB\'s plans for basic reform were far from </p><p>predictable.  Their design, as presented in post-election media </p><p>accounts, is attributed to Lula\'s deputy transition </p><p>coordinator, long-term core confidante, campaign coordinator in </p><p>the 1994 and 1998 presidential races, and now Secretary for </p><p>Communications, Luiz Gushiken.  Apart from his personal bond </p><p>with Lula, Gushiken comes substantively well-armed.  His </p><p>private consulting company specializes in social-security and </p><p>pension matters.  Health problems reportedly precluded him from </p><p>being put in charge of Previdencia, but his second-in-command </p><p>at the company, Augusto Tadeu Ferrarri, is presumed likely to </p><p>be involved in advancing the reform campaign. </p><p> </p><p>13.  NOTE:  Lula\'s first-round rival and second-round supporter </p><p>in the presidential race Ciro Gomes was said to want the </p><p>Previdencia job keenly.  However, Ciro\'s own proposals for </p><p>pension reform, as enunciated during the campaign, were for a </p><p>system of individual retirement accounts, the transition to </p><p>which by common professional agreement would have been </p><p>financially insupportable -- "two to three (Brazilian) GDPs," </p><p>according to Gushiken\'s firm.  Lula made Ciro Minister of </p><p>National Integration instead.  Previdencia went to Berzoini, a </p><p>42-year-old PT congressman and former bank-employee labor </p><p>leader with little apparent executive experience.  END NOTE. </p><p> </p><p>14.  The reform plan\'s twin premises are: (i) unification of </p><p>the private INSS and public-sector pension systems for all </p><p>future entrants to Brazil\'s workforce; and (ii) a common future </p><p>ceiling for all pensions.  That ceiling is putatively to be </p><p>fixed via negotiations with all affected parties by the GoB. </p><p>The official suggestion for now is that it should be somewhere </p><p>between Rs 1,561 (the ten \'minimum reference salaries\') and </p><p>twenty times the minimum salary (currently Rs 200, but due to </p><p>be raised at least to Rs 220.)  As first publicized, the PT </p><p>plan seemed to accept that Brazil\'s already-retired </p><p>("inativos") cannot be made to contribute to the pension </p><p>system.  However, new Previdencia chief Berzoini has begun to </p><p>hint otherwise. </p><p> </p><p>15.  What about Brazil\'s not-yet retired?  Previous debate on </p><p>pension reform has featured the rote GoB promise to respect </p><p>"acquired rights" -- code meaning that the rules of the game </p><p>will not be changed in mid-career for current public </p><p>functionaries.  In a new twist, though, PT party leader Genoino </p><p>and others now intone that "acquired rights" (i.e., pensions </p><p>already being paid to retirees) are not the same as "acquired </p><p>expectations" (i.e., current workers\' assumption that their </p><p>eventual pensions will be computed per the old basis.)  There </p><p>is now the suggestion that current public-sector employees will </p><p>see their eventual pensions diminished on a sliding scale from </p><p>10 to 40% of the "integral".  Only if some such change is </p><p>installed, of course, can the GoB realize major fiscal savings </p><p>anytime before the end of the working lifespan of functionaries </p><p>not yet even in the system -- i.e., three decades hence. </p><p> </p><p>16.  Lula thus seems positioned to place himself in favor of a </p><p>more radical Previdencia transformation than FHC ever </p><p>attempted.  In so doing, he and the new GoB will be turning </p><p>their backs on the PT\'s own history.  The latter is replete </p><p>with resistance to public-sector pension reform and to the </p><p>notion of those pensions being less than "integral".  Pushing </p><p>for such changes now will mean a tough battle with Brazil\'s </p><p>entrenched, well-organized public-sector unions.  The latter </p><p>now loom large in Brazil\'s labor movement generally, with the </p><p>PT said to have as much or more of a numerical base in mid-to- </p><p>lower level government workers than amongst factory workers. </p><p>Thus, the issue involves an early choice for Lula between past </p><p>party loyalties and current fiscal exigency. </p><p> </p><p>Prospects:  Better than Before </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>17.  For now, the GoB leaders\' byword is \'consultation.\'  All </p><p>are on-script in saying that social consensus for pension </p><p>reform should and will be arrived at via mass public dialogue. </p><p>The head of Lula\'s new "town-hall" Economic and Social </p><p>Development Council (Rio Grande do Sul\'s PT ex-governor Tarso </p><p>Genro) has said that producing a consensus on Previdencia will </p><p>be his Council\'s top task in the coming year.  As to why </p><p>beneficiaries of the status quo should agree to forfeit any </p><p>\'rights\', the new GoB argues that consensus will arise when all </p><p>realize that to keep the system alive as is will bankrupt it, </p><p>bringing worse losses for all. </p><p> </p><p>18.  Conversely, the question arises:  why would public-pension </p><p>reform not/not be a sure-fire political winner for any GoB, </p><p>given that it could be painted as a simple matter of Brazil\'s </p><p>\'maharajahs\' vs. its general population?  The answer seems to </p><p>be that even for lower-paid functionaries -- federal, state and </p><p>municipal -- "integral" pensions are a major, built-in life </p><p>expectation. </p><p> </p><p>19.  There is no guarantee that Brazil\'s more center/right </p><p>political parties which voted for pension reform before in </p><p>Congress will necessarily do so again in support of a PT </p><p>version.  And key questions such as whether "inativos" may be </p><p>made to pay into Previdencia remain to be judged by the Supreme </p><p>Court.  Most thus expect the fight on the Previdencia reform </p><p>front to be steeply uphill.  Yet we also already hear some </p><p>optimistic predictions, including from new Central Bank </p><p>Chairman Meirelles to Ambassador in their January 8 meeting </p><p>(Septel), that pension reform this year has good chances, given </p><p>Lula\'s landslide, his reserves of popular enthusiasm, and the </p><p>fact that the well-disciplined PT will now support it. </p><p> </p><p>Lula Sets Timetable </p><p>------------------- </p><p>20.  On January 7, Lula formally directed Berzoini together </p><p>with Economic and Social Development Counsel (ESDC) chief Genro </p><p>to initiate the Previdencia reform campaign by February.  Over </p><p>the following ninety days, Berzoini is to engage in broad, </p><p>country-wide discussions with politicians, businessmen, labor, </p><p>public servants, and NGOs.  He is to report the results to the </p><p>ESDC, which will harmonize public suggestions with the main </p><p>lines of the GoB\'s own draft design.  Proposals based on the </p><p>results of this process are to be presented to Lula in May, so </p><p>as to be worked into a bill for presentation to Congress before </p><p>summer adjournment. </p><p> </p><p>HRINAK </p><p></p></div>
