(independent "Nepal Samacharpatra," </p><p> V/D, 6/17) </p><p>MAOISTS AND OTHERS ACCUSE U.S. OF INTERFERENCE </p><p> </p><p>-- Maoists ask help from India and China for talks: The </p><p>Maoists have said that India and China should help to </p><p>make the government-Maoist talks successful.  The </p><p>Maoist party has claimed that India and China will be </p><p>the greatest sufferers if the U.S. plans of thwarting </p><p>the peace talks succeed.  "The U.S. is now blatantly </p><p>involved in a conspiracy to jeopardize the peace talks. </p><p>The five year antiterrorism agreement with the Royal </p><p>Nepal Army and the inclusion of the Maoists in the </p><p>terrorist list are some reflections of the conspiracy," </p><p>said senior Maoist leader Ram Bahadur Thapa "Badal" to </p><p>"Rajdhani".  The U.S. wants to capture the two huge </p><p>markets in the south and north by making Nepal a </p><p>strategic and political base, he said.  The U.S. has </p><p>come to Nepal to stop China and India from becoming its </p><p>future rivals, he said.

This has </p><p>compelled the Maoists to fight for our nationality. </p><p>The king has put forward Surya Bahadur Thapa as prime </p><p>minister to hold elections.  But the elections will not </p><p>be held for the Nepalese people, it will be in the </p><p>interests of the Palace and foreigners."  ("Nepal </p><p>Samacharpatra," 6/17) </p><p> </p><p>-- Human Rights Service Center criticizes U.S.: U.S. </p><p>Ambassador Michael Malinowski\'s remark that "the U.S. </p><p>doesn\'t like the Maoists\' activities in Nepali </p><p>politics" has interfered in the right of the Nepali </p><p>people to elect their own government.  Although America </p><p>has welcomed the talks, it is only external.  It is </p><p>actually trying to jeopardize the talks by directly </p><p>interfering in our national freedom and political and </p><p>civil rights.  We appeal to the U.S. President to annul </p><p>the recent secret antiterrorism agreement between Nepal </p><p>and the U.S. and take back his troops from here. </p><p>(letter by the Human Rights Service Center to the </p><p>editor, "Drishti" weekly, 6/17, UML-mouthpiece) </p><p> </p><p>-- Maoist spokesperson charges America: Maoist </p><p>spokesperson and talks team member Krishna Bahadur </p><p>Mahara said: "Foreigners are running this government </p><p>now.

The </p><p>third round of government-student talks ended without </p><p>conclusion after the student leaders walked out of the </p><p>talks on June 16 when the government expressed </p><p>inability to fulfil their demand of providing free </p><p>education up to secondary level in public schools. </p><p>("The Himalayan Times," 6/18) </p><p> </p><p>-- Government cannot make secondary education free, </p><p>says Minister: Education at the secondary-level cannot </p><p>be free owing to financial hardships facing the </p><p>country, the Minister for Education said.

Garment entrepreneurs said that the </p><p>government must immediately initiate steps to persuade </p><p>and convince the U.S. Senator on the socio-economic </p><p>impact of the bill\'s revocation on Nepal.  Nepal\'s </p><p>garment industry employs over 100,000 workers -- half </p><p>of them women -- and sustains the livelihood of over </p><p>350,000 people.  Feinstein\'s decision to retract her </p><p>support for the bill had come in the wake of Nepal\'s </p><p>"poor" handling of the extradition of eighteen Tibetans </p><p>recently.  However, the Nepali government had deported </p><p>the Tibetans stating that they had illegally crossed </p><p>over to Nepal. (Compiled from "The Kathmandu Post" and </p><p>others, 6/18) </p><p> </p><p>-- Government requests Senator not to withdraw bill: </p><p>Prime Minister Surya Bahadur Thapa said the government </p><p>had written a letter requesting Senator Dianne </p><p>Feinstein not to withdraw the bill for facilitating </p><p>entrance of Nepalese ready-made garments to America, in </p><p>the Senate.
