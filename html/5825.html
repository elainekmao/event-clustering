(U) This is an action request -- see para 8. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Summary:  MFA Depuuty Director General for </p><p>International Political Organizations Tunc Ugdul called </p><p>EconCouns in February 17 to discuss USG and GOT approaches to </p><p>refugee/IDP issues related to a potential Iraq operation. </p><p>Ugdul reiterated that Turkey\'s intention to set up Red </p><p>Crescent-run camps just across the border was compatible with </p><p>the U.S. approach of providing humanitarian assistance to </p><p>Iraqis beyond that border zone.  He said the GOT agreed in </p><p>principle to opening its borders to NGOs providing </p><p>humanitarian assitance, and asked why no NGOs had yet applied </p><p>for permission.  Ugdul also asked whether the USG planned to </p><p>open a humanitarian coordination center in Turkey similar to </p><p>that established in Kuwait.  Finally, he indicated that the </p><p>GOT was ready to approve the USG request to bring in and </p><p>store one million humanitarian daily rations, subject to </p><p>working out some logistical details.  Embassy will work with </p><p>Eucom regarding next steps on a coordination center, and </p><p>recommends that Washington encourage 1-2 NGOs to test the </p><p>GOT\'s professed willingness to open its border to them.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) MFA Deputy Director General for International </p><p>Political Organizations Tunc Ugdul called in EconCouns </p><p>February 17 to follow up on recent discussions on </p><p>Iraq-related humanitarian issues (reftels).  Ugdul said he </p><p>wanted to clarify what he termed "different perceptions" in </p><p>the USG and GOT about the outcome of those discussions. </p><p>Specifically, he was concerned by reports that the USG </p><p>thought its approach to the issue was significantly different </p><p>than that of the GOT.  EconCouns noted that the GOT approach </p><p>focused on establishing Red Crescent-run camps just across </p><p>the border, while the USG wanted to deliver food and other </p><p>supplies to Iraqi people where they live.  The USG was still </p><p>not sure whether Turkey would be willing to open its border </p><p>to NGOs so they could bring the necessary supplies from </p><p>Turkey into Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Ugdul argued that the two approaches were compatible, </p><p>and that Turkey, while establishing its camps across the </p><p>border, would in no way limit U.S. humanitarian efforts.  He </p><p>reiterated (ref A) that NGOs wishing to work in the Red </p><p>Crescent-run camps would need to negotiate and sign an MOU </p><p>with the MFA to ensure coordination.  Those wishing to work </p><p>beyond the border region (i.e. further into Iraq) did not </p><p>need to sign such an MOU, but would need GOT authorization. </p><p>Such NGOs should contact the MFA, explain their goals, their </p><p>proposed areas of operation, and what they planned to bring </p><p>across the border.  Once the GOT approved an NGO\'s general </p><p>application, the NGO would need to advise the MFA in advance </p><p>of each shipment so that the MFA could coordinate the border </p><p>crossing.    Ugdul said that, while the GOT had not formally </p><p>finalized this approach, his comments reflected official GOT </p><p>thinking at this point.  He asked why no NGOs had yet applied </p><p>to operate across the border, and agreed it would be useful </p><p>for 1-2 "credible" NGOs to apply in the near future.  The </p><p>only issue, he said, would be that the NGOs should confine </p><p>their activity to humanitarian and health work; the GOT would </p><p>not welcome NGOs coming to work in the political area. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Ugdul said the MFA was working with the ICRC on the </p><p>issue of the legal mandate to operate the camps across the </p><p>border.  He expected the GOT to approve shortly the ICRC\'s </p><p>request to open a temporary office in Turkey, and hoped that </p><p>the issue of legal mandate could be addressed via the Red </p><p>Crescent\'s membership in the IFRC. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Noting that the USG had established a Humanitarian </p><p>Operations Center (HOC) in Kuwait, Ugdul asked if the USG </p><p>intended to do so in Turkey.  If so, he suggested the Embassy </p><p>forward a specific proposal.  EconCouns responded that the </p><p>Humanitarian Planning Team had proposed, during its January </p><p>visit, establishing such a coordination mechanism, which </p><p>ideally would be "plugged" into the Kuwait HOC. </p><p>7.  (C) Finally, Ugdul said that, after an initial </p><p>misunderstanding, the GOT was now ready to approve the USG </p><p>request to bring in and store one million humanitarian daily </p><p>rations in Turkey, subject to some clarification of </p><p>logistical issues.  Embassy/ODC is following up directly with </p><p>the MFA on this. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Comment and Action Request:  Embassy recommends we </p><p>test the MFA\'s new-found openness on this issue.  We will use </p><p>this week\'s visit of General Pete Osman to discuss </p><p>(internally) next steps on establishing a coordination </p><p>center, and recommend that Washington encourage 1-2 NGOs to </p><p>apply to the MFA for approval to perform cross-border </p><p>operations. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
