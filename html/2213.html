<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 05 ABUJA 002938 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/21/2011 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, MOPS, PHUM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: TRYING TIMES </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter; reasons 1.5 (b) and </p><p>(d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: Nigeria has entered a period of unease. </p><p>During the past several months, the country\'s political elite </p><p>has been more attentive to political intrigue than the </p><p>demands of responsible governance. As a result, civilian </p><p>government faces multiple challenges. Communal clashes have </p><p>engendered a general sense of insecurity and doubts about GON </p><p>competence.  Proposed electoral reform has pitted state </p><p>governors against national lawmakers and could lead to a </p><p>constitutional showdown over election scheduling.  In the </p><p>lead up to the PDP national convention, internecine guerilla </p><p>politics threatened to balkanize the ruling party.  It took </p><p>last minute deal-making to produce an orderly convention that </p><p>has helped reduce the political heat; yet fissures remain in </p><p>the ruling party.  On the economic front, with unemployment </p><p>and inflation high, people are looking hard to find their </p><p>promised democracy dividend.  President Obasanjo\'s critics </p><p>cast these problems at his feet, claiming his heavy-handed </p><p>leadership style and </p><p> inattention to domestic matters have helped spark dry </p><p>tinder. Many Nigerians have voiced concern about the </p><p>sustainability of civilian government if the resulting </p><p>brushfires are not extinguished. It will take sustained </p><p>effort and political acumen to walk Nigeria out of its </p><p>current rough patch. Since returning from the U.S., President </p><p>Obasanjo has demonstrated more attention to internal security </p><p>in meetings with state governors and local leaders. End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>POLITICS WITHOUT PURPOSE </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) As the end of 2001 draws near, Nigeria is </p><p>significantly more tense than it was a year ago. If forced to </p><p>render an honest appraisal, the country\'s political elite </p><p>would have to blame itself for this diminution of Nigeria\'s </p><p>political stock.  Competition for position and influence in </p><p>local, state and federal governments and within the political </p><p>parties has been destabilizing. Electioneering, with an eye </p><p>toward the 2003 polls more than eighteen months away, began </p><p>months ago and consumes the full attention of most </p><p>politicians. With too many politicians jockeying for position </p><p>while trying to derail real and perceived opponents, the </p><p>electoral season has become perpetual and frenetic. The media </p><p>fuels the competition with a lively but indistinguishable mix </p><p>of factual and fictional reporting.  Not a day passes without </p><p>front-page reports of the latest Machiavellian intrigue and </p><p>political deadlock.  Relishing this partisan fare, </p><p>politicians and the media give scant substantive attention to </p><p>the issues of the day: p </p><p>ublic security, communal unrest and economic development to </p><p>improve the lives of the majority of Nigerians, who survive </p><p>on less than one dollar a day. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Instead of travelling a new, higher road under </p><p>President Obasanjo\'s expected moral guidance, politics </p><p>continue to be driven by money, greed, personal connections </p><p>and the all consuming ascriptive considerations of ethnicity, </p><p>region and religion. Policy formulation and platforms on </p><p>issues have become orphaned in the process.  Injected with </p><p>daily doses of this coarse politicking and perceiving no real </p><p>improvement in their lives, the public is increasingly </p><p>cynical and government is losing its relevance.  The growing </p><p>perception is that democratization is becoming a misnomer -- </p><p>that the political process is too top heavy and that </p><p>incumbents will hijack democratic processes for their own </p><p>benefit and that of their patrons and proteges. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>A GROWING SENSE OF INTERNAL INSECURITY </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) While politicians fiddle, civil disturbances have </p><p>flared with devastating impact during the past several </p><p>months.  An estimated three thousand are dead in the wake of </p><p>communal conflicts in Jos and Kano, as well as portions of </p><p>Kaduna, Nasarawa, Taraba and Benue states.  In each instance, </p><p>the police have been overwhelmed and unable to quash the </p><p>unrest.  The military was summoned to restore order or to </p><p>help the police to do so.  By our count, the military </p><p>controls internal security or provides significant assistance </p><p>to the police in parts of 15 of Nigeria\'s 36 states (The </p><p>British High Commission\'s count is 18 states).  The deterrent </p><p>presence of military units in Kaduna may have prevented </p><p>violence in the state capital when Shari\'a criminal law was </p><p>formally introduced November 2.  That Kaduna authorities felt </p><p>the need for a visible military presence demonstrates the </p><p>level of tension lurking in many areas of the country. </p><p>Moreover, troops in Kaduna City did not prevent a gruesome </p><p>incident (at least ten dead) </p><p>in the southeast corner of the state. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) There have been other disturbances with death tolls </p><p>directly related to partisan politics or political </p><p>manipulation of ethnic and religious differences in parts of </p><p>the country.  October street battles between rival PDP and </p><p>APP hoodlums in Zamfara State were bloody.  Communal and </p><p>political flare-ups in Delta state (Warri) and  the South </p><p>East region have cost lives and could easily rekindle.  Other </p><p>areas are simmering and could erupt as well.  A bitter </p><p>struggle between Kwara State Governor Mohammed Lawal and </p><p>political kingmaker Olusola Saraki exists alongside ethnic </p><p>muscle-flexing between partisans of the Hausa-Fulani emirate </p><p>system (established traditional rulers) and the Yoruba in </p><p>Ilorin.  The Yoruba (aspiring traditional rulers), who </p><p>probably now comprise a majority of the city\'s population, </p><p>want an Oba of Ilorin to be installed.  The ruling </p><p>Hausa-Fulani see this as an encroachment.  Complicating </p><p>relations between Hausa-Fulani and Yoruba everywhere is the </p><p>recent release in Lagos of the OPC\'s violent </p><p>street general Ganiyu Adams, whom Northerners blame for the </p><p>October 2000 Ajegunle riots that left scores of Hausa-Fulani </p><p>dead in Lagos. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) The frequency and intensity of the clashes, coupled </p><p>with the multiple military deployments throughout the </p><p>country, generate the impression that civilian politicians </p><p>cannot maintain order without the military\'s help.  In the </p><p>public mind, the question has turned from whether there will </p><p>be future communal violence to where and when that violence </p><p>will occur.  Politicians reinforce this sense of insecurity </p><p>by publicly bickering over the causes of the unrest and </p><p>assigning blame to their opponents.  For instance, Benue </p><p>Governor Akume has accused former PDP Chairman Gemade of </p><p>helping to stoke the violence there.  Minister of Defense </p><p>Danjuma, in turn, has reportedly accused Akume of spending </p><p>state funds to enlist former military personnel in Tiv </p><p>militia.  In turn, Danjuma has been accused of suborning his </p><p>Jukun brethren in their confrontation with the unpopular Tiv. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Some Nigerians are making negative comparisons, </p><p>stating that previous military governments were more adept at </p><p>preventing civil disorder than the current Administration. </p><p>Comparisons with Nigeria\'s last elected government - the </p><p>short-circuited Shagari Administration - are making the </p><p>rounds.  While the vast majority of Nigerians prefer </p><p>democracy and want to avoid a return of the military, they </p><p>also want a democracy that works.  At the very least, </p><p>civilian government should not be seen as undermining public </p><p>security and the economy.  The growing chorus of those who </p><p>say their lives were better during the Abacha years should </p><p>sound a disturbing alarm at Aso Villa.  Even if the chorus is </p><p>misguided and looking backward through rose-colored glasses, </p><p>perceptions are often more important than objective reality. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>ELECTORAL REFORM - COLLISION OR COMPROMISE? </p><p> ------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) The controversy over the proposed electoral law also </p><p>makes politicians appear so concerned with their own </p><p>preservation that they cannot adequately guide the ship of </p><p>state.  The reform would extend the tenure of incumbent local </p><p>governments.  This would make local government elections, now </p><p>slated for April of 2002, contemporaneous with Presidential, </p><p>National Assembly and Gubernatorial elections scheduled for </p><p>2003.  This sounds like a simple technical fix.  However, </p><p>such a change could alter political power relationships in </p><p>the states.  If local elections remain in 2002, governors and </p><p>state assembly members can better influence these elections, </p><p>laying solid ground work for their 2003 campaigns.  On the </p><p>other hand, the Presidency and national legislators will gain </p><p>greater influence at the local level and, thus, over the </p><p>governors\' re-election prospects if local elections are </p><p>delayed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) The constitution is unclear whether the National </p><p>Assembly can change election dates.  Governors have publicly </p><p>scorned the proposed measure as unconstitutional.  National </p><p>Assembly leaders likewise have chastised governors in their </p><p>public statements.  Meeting in mid-October, speakers of state </p><p>assemblies agreed to dissolve their local governments in </p><p>2002.  This would leave a one-year void at the local </p><p>government level should the proposal become law.  Since </p><p>electoral registers are to be compiled by the Independent </p><p>National Electoral Commission (INEC), INEC could refuse to </p><p>provide registers to the state-level commissions that are </p><p>supposed to run the local government elections.  The </p><p>state-level commissions might compile their own registers and </p><p>hold elections in defiance of INEC, or the governors might </p><p>appoint "care-taker" local government councils (that would </p><p>doubtless be firmly under gubernatorial control). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) President Obasanjo has met with governors and key </p><p>federal lawmakers to seek a resolution.  While the talks </p><p>might have succeeded in reducing the public rhetoric, there </p><p>is no sign of an agreed fix to this problem as of yet. Unless </p><p>the sides can find compromise, this issue becomes one of </p><p>constitutional interpretation for the courts.  But Nigeria\'s </p><p>discredited judiciary lacks adequate moral authority and </p><p>arbitrating such a high stakes political game would expose </p><p>the weak court system to intense political heat. If the </p><p>politicians toss such a highly charged issue into the courts, </p><p>there will likely be rulings and counter-rulings, injunctions </p><p>and counter-injunctions as few would be willing to accept a </p><p>ruling adverse to their interests.  Similar antics in the </p><p>past have led to such confusion that the entire political </p><p>process bogged down.  Nigeria\'s elected politicians know </p><p>this, but they seem intent to seek to maximize their personal </p><p>advantage with little regard for the effect their pursuits </p><p>have on the overal </p><p>l system. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>PDP - PUTTING THE TEMPEST BACK IN THE TEAPOT </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) Obasanjo\'s desire to eject PDP national chairman </p><p>Gemade (his hand-picked and expensively-purchased candidate </p><p>in 1999) and countless, unseemly turf battles at the local </p><p>level have undermined the credibility of the ruling party and </p><p>further whittled an already waning internal cohesion. As the </p><p>party held local and state congresses, in preparation for the </p><p>National Convention, competition turned white hot. </p><p>Allegations of cheating and intimidation were common.  In </p><p>some states, rival factions held separate congresses, picking </p><p>competing slates of delegates for the National Convention. </p><p>Trying to postpone the National Convention that would have </p><p>ousted Gemade from party leadership, pro-Gemade PDP officials </p><p>filed suit for an injunction.  Rumor has it that Gemade paid </p><p>the judge to issue the injunction.  Rumor also has it that </p><p>Obasanjo ordered that the same judge be paid even more to </p><p>lift the order. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) After several late night sessions of party leaders, </p><p>including the President, Gemade relinquished his claim to the </p><p>Chairmanship, reportedly in exchange for a fistful of Naira </p><p>and a promised Cabinet position.  Gemade\'s deal paved the way </p><p>for creation of a slate of unopposed candidates for all key </p><p>national party positions.  This slate was selected by </p><p>acclamation at the November 9 convention.  What had the </p><p>makings of a genuine donnybrook turned into a Nigerian-styled </p><p>garden party due to eleventh hour deal making and movement of </p><p>money.  Despite its flaws, that the convention did not </p><p>denigrate into an untidy affair has helped reduce overall </p><p>political tensions.  However, the party is sorely divided in </p><p>several states and the grumbling has not subsided completely. </p><p>  Many people are dissatisfied with the undemocratic manner </p><p>in which the national officials were selected and presented </p><p>as a fait accompli to the convention delegates.  Moreover, </p><p>the continuous running to the courts and crying in the press </p><p>to resolv </p><p>e what were essentially political disputes left a sour taste </p><p>in the public\'s mouth which the contrived sweetness of the </p><p>convention could not remove.  People see the PDP ructions not </p><p>as a principled fight but as a contest to see who wrests </p><p>control over the party for personal reasons that have little </p><p>to do with bringing democracy or better leadership to the </p><p>electorate. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>WHERE\'S THE ECONOMY, STUPID? </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C) While political competition has been in overdrive, </p><p>the government\'s stewardship of the economy has been focused </p><p>on short-term fixes to long-term problems.  The maxim that </p><p>civilian government runs an economy better than the military </p><p>has not provided much comfort thus far.  The Presidency </p><p>micro-manages economic policy, with either Obasanjo or Vice </p><p>President Abubakar making decisions even on routine matters. </p><p>At the local, state and national levels, most officials are </p><p>seen as venally dipping their hands into governmental </p><p>coffers. Unemployment remains high; manufacturing </p><p>productivity remains low.  The national government has said </p><p>the right things but shown little ability to actually </p><p>implement policies that would spur direct investment and </p><p>create jobs. Due primarily to budgetary indiscipline and </p><p>failure to rationalize exchange rates, the government missed </p><p>important targets in the IMF Stand-By-Agreement (SBA), which </p><p>has now expired.  Fortunately, the government is negotiating </p><p>an informal agreement with the </p><p>IMF which, if successful, may result in a new SBA down the </p><p>line.  However, due to the SBA expiry, Nigeria no longer </p><p>meets Paris Club terms and will have to renegotiate debt </p><p>repayment with its creditors. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C) On a positive note, privatization has gone fairly </p><p>well.  Complex transactions like NITEL, though behind </p><p>schedule, have moved faster than most experts anticipated. </p><p>The bidding to privatize NITEL was successful and generated </p><p>significantly more revenue than expected.  A bumper </p><p>agricultural crop and higher than expected oil revenues this </p><p>year will partially moderate negative perceptions of the </p><p>government\'s economic performance. However, economic strains </p><p>may be more pronounced in 2002. Following the slump in oil </p><p>prices, oil revenue likely will fall; Nigeria also cannot </p><p>completely insulate itself from the overall global downturn. </p><p>Meanwhile, there will be political pressure to engage in </p><p>deficit spending as elections approach. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>OBASANJO -- THE MAN IN THE MUDDLE </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15. (C) Many critics blame President Obasanjo for the tense </p><p>state of affairs.  They lambaste him for assuming the image </p><p>of an international statesman while neglecting pressing </p><p>matters at home.  Also, they claim that he has been </p><p>unprepared to engage in the dialogue and give-and-take </p><p>necessary for democratic politics to take hold.   Many </p><p>observers expected Obasanjo to expend significant effort </p><p>developing a political culture and the "informal </p><p>constitution" key to ensuring that the relationships between </p><p>the executive and the legislature and between the national </p><p>and state governments are cooperative and do not fall below a </p><p>certain level of propriety.  Instead, Obasanjo has been </p><p>described as too eager to choke dissent and differing </p><p>opinions. He has meddled in the internal affairs of the </p><p>National Assembly and tried to make the PDP and the National </p><p>Assembly subservient to Executive will.  He has also tried to </p><p>undermine governors who have shown too much independence or </p><p>who displeased him.  What should be accomplished </p><p>by dialogue, Obasanjo often attempts by edict, his </p><p>detractors\' claim.  In short, he has alienated many previous </p><p>supporters while garnering few new adherents; yet, many of </p><p>his past supporters recognize there are currently few viable </p><p>alternatives to Obasanjo\'s leadership. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16. (C) Some of this criticism of Obasanjo comes from the </p><p>sour grapes of people disappointed that Obasanjo has not </p><p>given them the benefits or access they expected, or has not </p><p>been as malleable as they thought he would be when elected </p><p>two years ago.  However, much of the criticism is justified. </p><p>Obasanjo\'s coarse performance might not be so pronounced had </p><p>the National Assembly or governors compensated with good </p><p>leadership at their respective levels. Unfortunately, too </p><p>many lawmakers and local executives have been masters at </p><p>enriching themselves while novices at governing. </p><p>Consequently, their failures have only served to aggravate </p><p>the impact of the President\'s lack of political skills. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>17. (C) Recently, Obasanjo has taken a few tentative steps </p><p>toward defusing political tension.  On October 31, he </p><p>formally inaugurated a national security panel.  The panel\'s </p><p>mandate is to examine the underlying causes of communal </p><p>violence and develop recommendations to prevent further </p><p>outbreaks.  If the panel is active and not another ad hoc </p><p>creation that does not function well or produces a report </p><p>that gathers dust, Obasanjo may recoup lost points.  He also </p><p>has met with the Benue, Nasarawa and Taraba state governors </p><p>and traditional rulers of the three states to defuse the </p><p>Tiv/Jukun violence in the area.  The President held a </p><p>November 11 meeting with all 36 governors to discuss internal </p><p>security.  These moves indicate recognition by the Presidency </p><p>that internal security must receive high priority.  The </p><p>meetings may also help narrow the political distance between </p><p>the President and some governors while also showing average </p><p>Nigerians that he is becoming engaged on an issue that means </p><p>a lot to them.  However, the </p><p> measure of success will not be in the number of meetings </p><p>held but in re-establishing a general sense of public </p><p>security. Given the complexity of many of these localized </p><p>disputes, reaching the objective will take sustained </p><p>attention and political will. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>PROSPECTS </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>18.  (C) Civilian politicians, in general, and Obasanjo, in </p><p>particular, have managed to steer the country into the roiled </p><p>waters between shore and shoal. Insecurity is a pervasive </p><p>sentiment.  Ethnic, religious and regional tensions are more </p><p>pronounced than at the beginning of the year.  Much of the </p><p>goodwill Obasanjo enjoyed at the outset of his mandate has </p><p>been expended, often with few positive results to show.  Hard </p><p>decisions that might inflict pain but are needed to </p><p>jump-start the economy will be increasingly difficult to take </p><p>as elections draw nearer.  Every group feels it is on the </p><p>wrong end of the political give- and-take, and zero sum </p><p>politics are omnipresent.  This sense of insecurity and loss </p><p>has also produced an unfortunate strain of selective amnesia </p><p>-- some people are starting to remember the days of military </p><p>rule as days of stability and order, rather than long years </p><p>of repression and suffering. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>19.  (C) Meanwhile, civilian politicians are so concerned </p><p>about maintaining themselves in office that they seem not to </p><p>give appropriate weight to the public\'s lack of confidence in </p><p>their collective performance.  They risk creating the </p><p>impression that civilian government is the sole reserve of </p><p>the elite rather than the only system of governance capable </p><p>of arbitrating competing demands in a diverse society without </p><p>resort to repression.  The political class could enhance its </p><p>stock by finding reasonable solutions to the electoral law </p><p>squabble and by softening the many jagged edges of party </p><p>politics.  More importantly, government at all levels -- but </p><p>most especially the federal government - needs to be seen as </p><p>getting a better handle on security issues. Prudent economic </p><p>management would also take the sting out of some </p><p>anti-government criticism.  If politicians do not show a </p><p>degree of statesmanship in these areas, next year promises to </p><p>prove more challenging than this one has turned out to be. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
