REASONS: </p><p>1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) ZANU-PF IS PROCEEDING IN ITS CAMPAIGN TO FORCE </p><p>INDEPENDENT-MINDED JUDGES OFF THE BENCH AND REPLACE THEM WITH </p><p>SYMPATHETIC OR PLIANT JURISTS, ACCORDING TO A CURRENT MEMBER OF </p><p>THE HIGH COURT BENCH.  THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATION (CIO) </p><p>IS REPORTEDLY WATCHING CERTAIN JUDGES VERY CLOSELY, INCLUDING </p><p>CONDUCTING PHYSICAL SURVEILLANCE, TAPPING THEIR PHONES, AND </p><p>OPENING THEIR MAIL.  THREE HIGH COURT JUDGES HAVE RESIGNED </p><p>SUDDENLY OVER THE PAST SEVERAL MONTHS, FED UP WITH THE ONGOING </p><p>INTIMIDATION, AND A FOURTH IS LIKELY TO FOLLOW SOON.  OUR </p><p>INTERLOCUTOR ECHOED CONVENTIONAL LOCAL WISDOM IN INSISTING THAT </p><p>PRESIDENT MUGABE WOULD DO "WHATEVER IS NECESSARY TO REMAIN IN </p><p>POWER" BEYOND THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, AND HE URGED THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO BEGIN THINKING ABOUT HOW IT WILL </p><p>RESPOND TO AN ILLEGITIMATE ELECTION OUTCOME.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>REMAKING THE JUDICIARY </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) HIGH COURT JUDGE YUNUS OMERJEE (STRICTLY PROTECT </p><p>THROUGHOUT) TOLD POLITICAL SECTION CHIEF ON AUGUST 27 THAT </p><p>PRESIDENT MUGABE AND HIS ADVISORS HAVE SUCCEEDED IN "SHAPING THE </p><p>JUDICIARY IN THEIR OWN IMAGE," AND SAID THE MASTERMIND BEHIND THIS </p><p>EFFORT IS JUSTICE MINISTER PATRICK CHINAMASA.  THE GOZ NOW HAS IN </p><p>PLACE A RELIABLY LOYAL CHIEF JUSTICE, GODFREY CHIDYAUSIKU, WHO WAS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02548  01 OF 02  291300Z </p><p>SWORN IN ON AUGUST 20.  OMERJEE DESCRIBED HIM AS A "RABID PARTY </p><p>MAN THROUGH AND THROUGH" WHO OWES EVERYTHING HE HAS AND HAS BECOME </p><p>TO ZANU-PF.  ACCORDING TO THE HIGH COURT JUDGE, CHIDYAUSIKU IS NOW </p><p>ASSEMBLING AN "A-TEAM" TO HEAR CASES OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE TO </p><p>THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH.   OMERJEE SAID THAT, IN ADDITION TO </p><p>CHIDYAUSIKU, THE THREE RECENT APPOINTEES TO THE SUPREME COURT -- </p><p>MISHECK CHEDA, LUKE MALABA, AND VERNANDA ZIYAMBI (REF A) -- AND </p><p>JUSTICE IBRAHIM WOULD LIKELY COMPRISE THE A-TEAM EITHER BECAUSE </p><p>THEY ARE CONSIDERED SYMPATHETIC TO ZANU-PF, OR ARE PLIANT. </p><p>OMERJEE NOTED THAT CASES INVOLVING CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTIONS MUST </p><p>BE HEARD BY FIVE JUSTICES, AND THAT MAJORITY OPINIONS REQUIRE THE </p><p>VOTES OF ONLY THREE.  POLITICAL SECTION CHIEF POINTED OUT THAT </p><p>CHEDA HAS BEEN CRITICAL OF CHIDYAUSIKU IN THE PAST AND ASKED WHY </p><p>THE GOZ MIGHT CONSIDER HIM SYMPATHETIC.  CHEDA, OMERJEE REPORTED, </p><p>HAD RECENTLY BEEN ALLOCATED LAND UNDER THE FAST TRACK RESETTLEMENT </p><p>PROGRAM, AND HIS BROTHER HAD RECENTLY BEEN APPOINTED TO THE HIGH </p><p>COURT.  THE NEW SUPREME COURT JUSTICE, THEREFORE, MIGHT FEEL SOME </p><p>PRESSURE TO HEW TO THE GOZ LINE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) POLITICAL SECTION CHIEF ASKED FOR OMERJEE\'S ASSESSMENT OF </p><p>THE THREE JUDGES NAMED TO THE HIGH COURT ON AUGUST 20.   HE </p><p>CONFERRED HIGH PRAISE ON NICHOLAS NDOU, AN NDEBELE WHO HAS WORKED </p><p>AS A MAGISTRATE, PROSECUTOR, AND LAW PROFESSOR, WHOM HE DESCRIBED </p><p>AS "ABOVE REPROACH."  HE WAS LESS ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT THE OTHER </p><p>TWO, HOWEVER.  MAPHIOS CHEDA, THE BROTHER OF THE NEW SUPREME COURT </p><p>JUSTICE, COMES FROM PRIVATE PRACTICE.  HE IS "VERY MEDIOCRE, GIVEN </p><p>TO EXCITABILITY, AND POMPOUS," AND IS CLEARLY SYMPATHETIC TO ZANU- </p><p>PF.  ACCORDING TO OMERJEE, BENJAMIN PARADZA IS "OKAY" BUT "COMES </p><p>WITH A LOT OF BAGGAGE."  HE IS A WAR VETERAN AND HAS BEEN A "VERY </p><p>AVERAGE PERFORMER" DURING HIS YEARS IN PRIVATE PRACTICE. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02548  01 OF 02  291300Z </p><p>PERSONAL SECURITY </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) ASKED WHETHER HE PERSONALLY FELT UNDER THREAT, OMERJEE </p><p>SAID HE HAS BEEN INFORMED BY RELIABLE SOURCES THAT HIS PHONES ARE </p><p>TAPPED AND THAT HE AND OTHER JUDGES ARE UNDER CONSTANT PHYSICAL </p><p>SURVEILLANCE.  HE HAS INTENTIONALLY AVOIDED HIRING A SECURITY </p><p>GUARD FOR HIS RESIDENCE BECAUSE HE ASSUMES THE PERSON WOULD BE </p><p>ASKED TO KEEP TABS ON HIM, HIS FAMILY, AND THEIR VISITORS. </p><p>CONVINCED THAT THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATION WAS OPENING </p><p>HIS MAIL, HE NOW HAS HIS MAIL SENT TO A FRIEND\'S HOUSE.  OMERJEE </p><p>SAID THAT THREE OF HIS COLLEAGUES ON THE HIGH COURT -- JAMES </p><p>DEVITTIE (REF B), MICHAEL GILLESPIE, AND ISMAEL CHATIKOBA -- HAD </p><p>RESIGNED SUDDENLY DURING THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS BECAUSE THEY WERE </p><p>FED UP WITH THE ONGOING HARASSMENT AND INTIMIDATION.  A FOURTH, </p><p>MOSES CHINHENGO, IS TRYING DESPERATELY TO GET OUT, BUT WON\'T </p><p>RESIGN UNTIL HE IS ABLE TO ASSEMBLE A FINANCIAL PACKAGE FOR </p><p>STUDIES IN AUSTRALIA.  OMERJEE SAID HE HAS NO INTEREST IN BECOMING </p><p>A MARTYR AND IS MAKING CONTINGENCY PLANS TO TAKE HIS FAMILY -- A </p><p>WIFE AND THREE YOUNG CHILDREN BELOW THE AGE OF NINE -- TO ZAMBIA </p><p>AND ON TO EUROPE IF THE SITUATION DETERIORATES FURTHER. </p><p> </p><p>ZANU-PF\'S ELECTION STRATEGY </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ2525 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  02548  02 OF 02  291300Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00  INL-00 </p><p>      DINT-00  DODE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00 </p><p>      FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00 </p><p>      LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    DCP-01   NSAE-00  OIC-02 </p><p>      OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00 </p><p>      SP-00    STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-01 </p><p>      DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00    /011W </p><p>                  ------------------1842D7  291301Z /38 </p><p>P 291249Z AUG 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 9581 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 002548 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL. 08/28/11 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PGOV, PREL, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: ZIMBABWEAN GOVERNMENT REMAKING JUDICIARY IN ITS OWN IMAGE </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) OMERJEE DESCRIBED THE RULING PARTY\'S PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  02548  02 OF 02  291300Z </p><p>STRATEGY AS "TOTAL WARFARE" AND SAID "ANYONE WHO STICKS HIS HEAD </p><p>UP WILL BE STRUCK DOWN."  ZANU-PF IS PLAYING A "BRILLIANT" NUMBERS </p><p>GAME, OMERJEE DECLARED.  THE PARTY HAS DECLARED THE RURAL AREAS </p><p>NO-GO AREAS FOR MDC CAMPAIGNERS AND IS USING ALL AVAILABLE TACTICS </p><p>TO ENSURE THAT THEIR RURAL SUPPORTERS VOTE ON ELECTION DAY.  IN </p><p>URBAN AREAS, THE PARTY IS TRYING TO DECREASE THE MDC\'S SUPPORT </p><p>THROUGH A COMBINATION OF INTIMIDATION AND BUYING PEOPLE OFF.  THE </p><p>RECENT INAUGURATION OF A COMMUTER TRAIN AND LAUNCHING OF A LOW- </p><p>COST HOUSING SCHEME IN A HIGH-DENSITY HARARE SUBURB ARE KEY </p><p>ELEMENTS OF THE URBAN CAMPAIGN, ACCORDING TO OMERJEE.  THE </p><p>OVERARCHING STRATEGY IS TO SECURE THE PARTY\'S STRONGHOLD (RURAL </p><p>AREAS) AND TO CREATE CONFUSION IN THE MDC\'S STRONGHOLD (URBAN </p><p>AREAS). </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) ASKED WHETHER THE FARM INVASIONS DID NOT CONSTITUTE </p><p>ECONOMIC SUICIDE, OMERJEE AGREED, BUT INSISTED THAT PRESIDENT </p><p>MUGABE WILL DO "ANYTHING, EVERYTHING," TO STAY IN POWER.  MUGABE </p><p>SIMPLY WILL NOT TOLERATE ANYONE WRESTING POWER FROM HIM, AND THAT </p><p>IS THE BOTTOM LINE, OMERJEE ASSERTED.  MUGABE AND ZANU-PF, OMERJEE </p><p>CONTINUED, WON POWER THROUGH VIOLENT MEANS, AND THEY ARE PREPARED </p><p>TO REVISIT THOSE MEANS IF NECESSARY.  ONE UNDERESTIMATED THEIR </p><p>DETERMINATION TO DO SO AT ONE\'S "GRAVE PERIL," OMERJEE WARNED. </p><p>THAT SAID, MUGABE IS NOT LIKELY TO DECLARE A STATE OF EMERGENCY, </p><p>BECAUSE SUCH A STEP WOULD CONSTITUTE AN ADMISSION OF GUILT OR </p><p>WRONGDOING.  HOWEVER, HE WILL FIND A WAY TO STAY IN POWER BEYOND </p><p>THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.  OMERJEE URGED THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>COMMUNITY TO BEGIN PLANNING NOW HOW IT WILL RESPOND IN THE </p><p>AFTERMATH OF AN ELECTION THAT HE BELIEVES WILL INEVITABLY BE </p><p>STOLEN. IN THE MEANTIME, OMERJEE INSISTED THAT THE ONLY ACTION </p><p>LIKELY TO FORCE MUGABE TO PULL ZIMBABWE BACK FROM THE PRECIPICE IS </p><p>A SUSTAINED CURTAILING OF FUEL AND ELECTRICITY SUPPLIES.  SOUTH </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02548  02 OF 02  291300Z </p><p>AFRICA IS CLEARLY KEY IN THIS REGARD, BUT OMERJEE ACKNOWLEDGED </p><p>THAT PRETORIA IS UNLIKELY TO TAKE SUCH A DRASTIC STEP.  OMERJEE </p><p>REMARKED THAT HE HAS BEGUN TO LOSE HOPE FOR THE FUTURE OF </p><p>ZIMBABWE. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) OMERJEE HAS BEEN A RELIABLE AND FRANK INTERLOCUTOR WITH </p><p>EMBASSY OFFICERS.  HE IS BRIGHT, FUNNY, AND OPTIMISTIC BY NATURE, </p><p>BUT WE WERE STRUCK IN THIS MEETING BY HIS UNCHARACTERISTIC SENSE </p><p>OF FOREBODING ABOUT THE DIRECTION IN WHICH ZIMBABWE IS HEADING.  A </p><p>FORMER PERMANENT SECRETARY UNDER EMMERSON MNANGAGWA AT THE </p><p>MINISTRY OF JUSTICE, OMERJEE KNOWS MNANGAGWA AND OTHER SENIOR </p><p>ZANU-PF FIGURES WELL, SO WE VALUE HIS ASSESSMENTS OF RULING PARTY </p><p>STRATEGIES AND TACTICS. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) IT IS TROUBLING, BUT NOT SURPRISING, TO HEAR CONFIRMATION </p><p>THAT THE GOZ IS CONTINUING ITS CAMPAIGN AGAINST INDEPENDENT-MINDED </p><p>JURISTS -- ALBEIT MORE QUIETLY THAN IN THE PAST -- AND IS </p><p>SUCCEEDING IN FORCING A NUMBER OF WELL-RESPECTED JUDGES TO LEAVE </p><p>THE BENCH.  ALTHOUGH WE MUST CONTINUE OUR EFFORTS TO LEVEL THE </p><p>PLAYING FIELD FOR THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, WE SHARE OMERJEE\'S </p><p>VIEW THAT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY SHOULD START PLANNING NOW </p><p>FOR THE DAY AFTER WHAT COULD POSSIBLY EMERGE AS AN ILLEGITIMATE </p><p>MUGABE VICTORY.  MUGABE IS CLEARLY COUNTING THAT, ONCE HE "WINS" </p><p>ANOTHER SIX-YEAR MANDATE, THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WILL HAVE NO </p><p>CHOICE BUT TO DEAL WITH HIM.  NEVERTHELESS, WE SHOULD CONTINUE ALL </p><p>OF OUR EFFORTS TO MAKE IT AS DIFFICULT AS POSSIBLE FOR MUGABE AND </p><p>ZANU-PF TO STEAL THE ELECTION. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02548  02 OF 02  291300Z </p><p>ROTH </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
