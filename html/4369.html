<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 008373 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR P, EUR AND PM; JCS FOR VCJCS, J5 LTG CASEY AND </p><p>J3; OSD FOR ASD RODMAN AND ASD CROUCH; CENTCOM FOR POLAD </p><p>AND J5 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/02/2012 </p><p>TAGS: MOPS, MARR, PREL, TU, UK, AF </p><p>SUBJECT: ISAF COMMANDER MG ZORLU\'S VISIT TO THE US - </p><p>RECOMMENDATIONS FOR MEETINGS WITH USG OFFICIALS </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Deputy Chief of Mission Robert Deutsch. </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) This is an action request.  See para 5. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) MFA DDG for South Asian Affairs Aydin Evirgen recently </p><p>informed Deputy Pol-Mil Counselor that ISAF Commander MG </p><p>Zorlu would be traveling to the US November 20-26 to meet </p><p>with USG and UN officials and private organizations to </p><p>discuss Turkey\'s experience as ISAF lead nation and the </p><p>general security situation in Afghanistan.  Zorlu is </p><p>scheduled to be in Washington November 21-22 and in New York </p><p>November 25-26.  Evirgen said the visit was MG Zorlu\'s idea, </p><p>but stressed that it enjoyed widespread support within the </p><p>Turkish General Staff (TGS) and the MFA. (TGS Navy Captain </p><p>Sinani separately told Deputy Pol-Mil Counselor November 15 </p><p>that the TGS leadership supported the visit as an opportunity </p><p>to increase awareness in the US of the role that Turkey is </p><p>playing in Afghanistan and in the larger global war on </p><p>terrorism.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Evirgen said the Turkish Embassy in Washington was </p><p>attempting to schedule meetings with senior USG officials and </p><p>asked that the Embassy support these efforts.  According to </p><p>Evirgen, the Turkish Embassy initially requested appointments </p><p>with the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint </p><p>Chiefs of Staff, but has since learned the two will be in </p><p>Prague for the NATO Summit.  The Turkish Embassy reportedly </p><p>is now trying to schedule meetings with the Deputy Secretary </p><p>of Defense and VCJCS Gen Pace.  Evirgen also noted that the </p><p>MFA believed it would be a good idea for MG Zorlu to meet </p><p>with a senior State Department official and said he would ask </p><p>the Turkish Embassy in Washington to request a meeting with </p><p>U/S Grossman. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. Comment: Given that MG Zorlu has been stationed in Kabul </p><p>since June and focusing his attention on ISAF-related issues, </p><p>we do not expect him to initiate discussion with USG </p><p>officials on Iraq, nor do we expect him to be intimately </p><p>familiar with the details of the discussions between US and </p><p>Turkish officials on Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Action request:  The Embassy strongly supports the </p><p>visit of MG Zorlu to the US and recommends that the </p><p>Department of Defense (OSD and JCS) and the State Department </p><p>receive MG Zorlu at the highest possible level.  By all </p><p>accounts, MG Zorlu -- who was hand-picked by TGS CHOD Ozkok </p><p>-- has done an excellent job as ISAF commander since taking </p><p>over in June.  By receiving Zorlu at an appropriately high </p><p>level, the USG can reinforce the importance we attach to the </p><p>strategic partnership and our appreciation for Turkey\'s </p><p>performance as ISAF lead nation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
