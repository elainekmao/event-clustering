(C)  IN PREPARATION FOR ITALY,S PRESIDENCY OF THE EU </p><p>DURING THE SECOND HALF OF 2003, U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THE EU </p><p>ROCKWELL SCHNABEL PAID INTRODUCTORY CALLS ON ITALIAN MFA </p><p>SECRETARY GENERAL GIUSEPPE BALDOCCI AND GIOVANNI </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>CASTELLANETA, DIPLOMATIC ADVISOR TO THE PRIME MINISTER, </p><p>OCTOBER 17.  BALDOCCI QUESTIONED THE GREEK,S ABILITY TO </p><p>SUCCESSFULLY HANDLE THE 2003 U.S.-EU SUMMIT AND EXPRESSED </p><p>INTEREST IN A SECOND SUMMIT DURING THE ITALIAN PRESIDENCY. </p><p>BOTH OFFICIALS FELT THE EU HAD FALLEN SHORT BY FAILING TO </p><p>PROVIDE THE TURKS A DATE CERTAIN TO BEGIN ACCESSION TALKS. </p><p>BOTH WANTED THE GAC TO SEND A SUPPORTIVE MESSAGE TO TURKEY IN </p><p>ADVANCE OF THE NOVEMBER 3 ELECTION.  THOUGH BOTH OFFICIALS </p><p>CONFIRMED NO FINAL DECISION ON ITALY,S EU PROGRAM HAD BEEN </p><p>TAKEN, THEY INDIVIDUALLY LISTED CONCLUSION OF THE EU,S </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL PROCESS, ENLARGEMENT, THE MEDITERRANEAN, AND </p><p>ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION AS KEY AREAS FOR FOCUS.  BOTH WERE LESS </p><p>OPTIMISTIC OVER FINDING A WAY OUT ON THE U.S.-EU DISAGREEMENT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  05255  01 OF 03  280906Z </p><p>OVER AGRICULTURAL BIOTECHNOLOGY.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>BALDOCCI </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>PRESIDENCY PROGRAM </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  MFA SECRETARY GENERAL BALDOCCI TOLD THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>THAT PREPARING FOR THE EU PRESIDENCY WOULD BE A "BURDEN." </p><p>THE ORGANIZATIONAL REQUIREMENTS WOULD BE CONSIDERABLE.  THE </p><p>GOI WAS CURRENTLY WORKING TO SET OUT ITS PRIORITIES.  THE </p><p>MFA\'S DIRECTOR GENERAL FOR EUROPEAN INTEGRATION, ROCCO </p><p>CANGELOSI, IS FOLLOWING THROUGH DIRECTLY ON THE INITIATIVE. </p><p>(EMBASSY NOTE, CANGELOSI IS DESIGNATED TO BE COUNTERPART TO </p><p>U/S LARSON FOR PRESIDENCY ISSUES.)  HE EXPECTED AN </p><p>ANNOUNCEMENT OF AN ITALIAN PROGRAM "IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS." </p><p>THAT AGENDA WOULD NEED POLITICAL, AS WELL AS PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>APPROVAL </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  HIGHEST ON THE AGENDA WOULD BE AN INTERGOVERNMENTAL </p><p>CONFERENCE (IGC) THAT WOULD PREFERABLY OPEN AND CLOSE DURING </p><p>THE ITALIAN PRESIDENCY.  THERE WAS MUCH MORAL SUPPORT FOR A </p><p>SIGNING A SECOND "TREATY OF ROME", BUT THE FINAL OUTCOME </p><p>WOULD DEPEND ON THE OUTCOME OF THE CURRENT CONVENTION ON THE </p><p>FUTURE OF EUROPE AND WHETHER IT WOULD BE ABLE TO PRODUCE AN </p><p>ACCEPTABLE "CONSTITUTIONAL TREATY" FOR THE EU.  BALDOCCI </p><p>ADMITTED THE CONVENTION REMAINED DIVIDED.  BUT OPTIONS FOR </p><p>DEALING WITH EUROPEAN INSTITUTIONAL QUESTIONS, HOWEVER THEY </p><p>AROSE, COULD NOT BE REALISTICALLY CONSIDERED UNTIL 2003. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  05255  01 OF 03  280906Z </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  REGIONALLY, BALDOCCI SAID THE MEDITERRANEAN ALSO </p><p>SPARKED INTEREST, DRIVEN LARGELY BY CONCERNS OVER TERRORISM. </p><p>ITALIAN PROXIMITY TO THE BALKANS ALSO ENSURED THAT AN EFFORT </p><p>TO MAINTAIN MOMENTUM IN THAT REGION WOULD BE CONSIDERED FOR </p><p>FOCUS.  BALDOCCI ADDED TRANSATLANTIC RELATIONS WOULD FIGURE </p><p>PROMINENTLY. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  AMBASSADOR SCHNABEL SAID HE HOPED THE U.S. AND EU </p><p>COULD MAKE PROGRESS ON THE EUROPOL II AGREEMENT.  BALDOCCI </p><p>NOTED THAT JHA COOPERATION WOULD BE PART OF THE ITALIAN </p><p>AGENDA.  HE COMMENTED THAT TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS HAS BECOME </p><p>MORE PRESSING AS AN ISSUE AS THE EU MOVES CLOSER TO </p><p>ENLARGEMENT.  HE PERSONALLY WANTED TO SEE THE COMMUNITY </p><p>ASSUME MORE RESPONSIBILITY.  CEMENTING ACHIEVEMENTS IN THE </p><p>INTERNAL MARKET AND FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS OF THE IMPENDING </p><p>ENLARGEMENT WOULD ALSO BE UNDER CONSIDERATION FOR THE </p><p>PRESIDENCY PROGRAM. </p><p> </p><p>SUMMITS </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  BALDOCCI TOLD THE AMBASSADOR HE UNDERSTOOD THE </p><p>EARLIER U.S. DECISION TO MOVE TO ONE U.S.-EU SUMMIT PER YEAR, </p><p>AND ACKNOWLEDGED THAT STICKING TO TRADITION WOULD MEAN THAT </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ8861 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  05255  02 OF 03  280907Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00  CTME-00 </p><p>      INL-00   DODE-00  DOTE-00  PERC-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00 </p><p>      EXIM-01  E-00     FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00    FRB-00   H-01 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   ITC-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NEA-00 </p><p>      DCP-01   NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00 </p><p>      PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SCT-00   SP-00    SSO-00   SS-00 </p><p>      STR-00   T-00     USIE-00  EPAE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00 </p><p>      DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00    /010W </p><p>                  ------------------FF1819  280907Z /38 </p><p>O 280815Z OCT 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 6597 </p><p>USEU BRUSSELS IMMEDIATE 2876 </p><p>INFO EU CANDIDATE STATES COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p>EU INTEREST COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p>EU MEMBER STATES COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p>AMCONSUL FLORENCE PRIORITY </p><p>AMCONSUL MILAN PRIORITY </p><p>AMCONSUL NAPLES PRIORITY </p><p>DEPT OF TREASURY WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>USDOC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 ROME 005255 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EUR/WE AND EUR/ERA. </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/28/2012 </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  05255  02 OF 03  280907Z </p><p>TAGS: PREL, ECON, EFIN, IR, TU, EU, EAGR, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: GOI BRIEFS USEU AMB SCHNABEL ON EU PRESIDENCY </p><p>PRIORITES, IRAN, TURKEY, BIOTECH </p><p> </p><p>SUMMIT SHOULD FALL DURING THE GREEK PRESIDENCY.  THE QUESTION </p><p>OF JUST HOW THE GREEKS WOULD HANDLE THE SUMMIT TASK WAS OF </p><p>GREAT INTEREST TO THE ITALIANS.  WHILE BALDOCCI UNDERSTOOD </p><p>THE DEMANDS ON PRESIDENT BUSH,S SCHEDULE WERE GREAT, AND THE </p><p>CONCERN THAT THERE WOULD BE LITTLE IN THE WAY OF "NEW </p><p>DISCOVERIES" MADE AT A SECOND SUMMIT, HE ASKED WHETHER, GIVEN </p><p>THE IMPORTANCE OF THE RELATIONSHIP, ONCE OR TWICE A YEAR WAS </p><p>MORE APPROPRIATE.  HE SAW THE MEETING AS MORE THAN SYMBOLIC. </p><p>IT WAS PART OF THE CLOSE CHARACTERISTIC OF U.S.-EU RELATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>TURKEY </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  AMBASSADOR SCHNABEL NOTED THE IMPORTANCE OF </p><p>INCLUDING TURKEY AS A VITAL PART OF A STRONG EUROPE. </p><p>BALDOCCI SAID HE HAD BEEN PERSONALLY DISAPPOINTED BY THE </p><p>OCTOBER 9 COMMISSION REPORT LANGUAGE, DESCRIBING HIS POSITION </p><p>AS "CLOSER TO THE AMBASSADOR,S." THE EU HAD RECEIVED CLEAR </p><p>INDICATORS FROM THE GOT OF A WILL TO CHANGE.  HE HOPED THAT </p><p>UNDER AN ITALIAN PRESIDENCY IT WOULD GIVE A CONCRETE SIGNAL </p><p>TO THE TURKS.  HE WAS WORKING TO PRESS THE IDEA OF TURKEY AS </p><p>AN IMPORTANT COUNTRY THAT SHOULD BE PART OF EUROPE WITHIN THE </p><p>GOI.  RESPONDING TO DCM,S SUGGESTION THAT A POSITIVE SIGNAL </p><p>WOULD BE NEEDED BEFORE NOVEMBER 3 TURKISH ELECTIONS, BALDOCCI </p><p>NOTED AN OCTOBER 18 MEETING TO PREPARE FOR THE GENERAL </p><p>AFFAIRS AND EXTERNAL RELATIONS COUNCIL MEETING ON OCT. 21-22. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  05255  02 OF 03  280907Z </p><p> AT THAT SESSION, HE WOULD PERSONALLY PRESS FOR A POSITIVE EU </p><p>SIGNAL TO TURKEY BEFORE THE END OF OCTOBER. </p><p> </p><p>IRAN </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  RESPONDING TO THE DCM,S QUESTION ON THE ITALIAN </p><p>PRESIDENCY,S TAKE ON IRAN AND THE EU\'S WILLINGNESS TO </p><p>INTRODUCE A UNCHR RESOLUTION, BALDOCCI NOTED THAT AS ITALIAN </p><p>AMBASSADOR IN TEHRAN IN THE MID-1980S, HE HAD BEEN IMPRESSED </p><p>BY THE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES HE HAD WITNESSED.  IRAN REMAINED </p><p>HIGH ON THE EU AGENDA, BUT JUST HOW ITALY WOULD APPROACH A </p><p>RESOLUTION REMAINED TO BE DECIDED.  THE DCM NOTED THAT THE </p><p>U.S. WAS NOT OPPOSED TO ENGAGEMENT PER SE, BUT WOULD EXPECT </p><p>THAT THE EU WOULD COMMENT ON UNACCEPTABLE ASPECTS OF IRANIAN </p><p>POLICY.  BALDOCCI AGREED TO CONSIDER THE REQUEST.  HE NOTED </p><p>THAT GREAT BUT GRADUAL CHANGES WERE TAKING PLACE IN IRAN. </p><p>WHILE THOSE IN POWER WERE NOT TRUSTWORTHY, IT WOULD BE </p><p>IMPORTANT TO FIND WAYS TO ENGAGE THE YOUNGER GENERATION. </p><p>IRANIANS HE KNEW WERE EAGER FOR GOOD RELATIONS WITH THE </p><p>UNITED STATES. </p><p> </p><p>BIOTECH </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU)  NOTING ITALIAN CULTURAL CONCERNS, THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>ASKED HOW ITALY WOULD CARRY FORWARD THE BIOTECH ISSUE DURING </p><p>ITS PRESIDENCY.  WHILE ADMITTING HE DID NOT FOLLOW THE </p><p>DOSSIER HIMSELF, BALDOCCI NOTED THAT BEFORE ADOPTING </p><p>REGULATIONS ON SENSITIVE ISSUES WITH TRANSATLANTIC EFFECTS </p><p>LIKE BIOTECH, HE SUPPORTED MORE IN DEPTH CONSULTATION. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  05255  02 OF 03  280907Z </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>CASTELLANETA </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>PRESIDENCY PROGRAM </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C)  THE PM\'S DIPLOMATIC ADVISOR GIOVANNI CASTELLANETA </p><p>TOLD THE AMBASSADOR THAT WHILE SENIOR OFFICIALS IN THE GOI </p><p>WERE STILL COLLECTING IDEAS, HE BELIEVED THE OUTCOME OF THE </p><p>EU CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION, IMPROVING ECONOMIC TIES IN THE </p><p>MEDITERRANEAN (THE BARCELONA PROCESS), COMPLETING MEMBER </p><p>STATE RATIFICATION OF THE ENLARGEMENT, AND COMBATING ILLEGAL </p><p>IMMIGRATION WOULD LIKELY BE KEY PRIORITIES DURING THE ITALIAN </p><p>PRESIDENCY.   HE ADDED THAT LINKED WITH ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION, </p><p>THE QUESTION OF TERRORISM MIGHT ALSO BE ADDRESSED.  WHILE </p><p>SPRING COUNCILS TRADITIONALLY DEALT WITH THE LISBON PROCESS, </p><p>GIVEN THE IMPORTANCE OF EMPLOYMENT TO THE CENTER RIGHT </p><p>BERLUSCONI GOVERNMENT, IT MIGHT ALSO FIND A PLACE IN THE </p><p>PROGRAM. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C)  RESPONDING TO AMBASSADOR SCHNABEL,S COMMENT THAT </p><p>PREVIOUS U.S.-EU SUMMITS HAD NOT WARRANTED EXTENSIVE MEDIA </p><p>COVERAGE, CASTELLANETA NOTED THE COUNCIL "NEEDED A PRESIDENT" </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ8862 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  05255  03 OF 03  280907Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00  CTME-00 </p><p>      INL-00   DODE-00  DOTE-00  PERC-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00 </p><p>      EXIM-01  E-00     FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00    FRB-00   H-01 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   ITC-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NEA-00 </p><p>      DCP-01   NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00 </p><p>      PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SCT-00   SP-00    SSO-00   SS-00 </p><p>      STR-00   T-00     USIE-00  EPAE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00 </p><p>      DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00    /010W </p><p>                  ------------------FF1821  280907Z /38 </p><p>O 280815Z OCT 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 6598 </p><p>USEU BRUSSELS IMMEDIATE 2877 </p><p>INFO EU CANDIDATE STATES COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p>EU INTEREST COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p>EU MEMBER STATES COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p>AMCONSUL FLORENCE PRIORITY </p><p>AMCONSUL MILAN PRIORITY </p><p>AMCONSUL NAPLES PRIORITY </p><p>DEPT OF TREASURY WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>USDOC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 ROME 005255 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EUR/WE AND EUR/ERA. </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/28/2012 </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  05255  03 OF 03  280907Z </p><p>TAGS: PREL, ECON, EFIN, IR, TU, EU, EAGR, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: GOI BRIEFS USEU AMB SCHNABEL ON EU PRESIDENCY </p><p>PRIORITES, IRAN, TURKEY, BIOTECH </p><p> </p><p>TO GET ATTENTION AND GISCARD WAS LEANING IN THAT DIRECTION IN </p><p>THE CONVENTION.  ONE OF GISCARD\'S DEPUTIES, FORMER PM AMATO, </p><p>AND THE ITALIAN DELEGATION, LED BY DEPUTY PM FINI, HAVE BEEN </p><p>AMONG THE GREATEST SUPPORTERS OF A STRONGER EUROPE.  THE </p><p>INSTITUTIONS NEED TO BE REORGANIZED.  BERLUSCONI, WHO "DID </p><p>NOT LIKE TECHNICALITIES," FELT "PILLARS" SHOULD BE ABOLISHED. </p><p> REFORM SHOULD SIMPLIFY THE EU PROCESS AND CLARIFY </p><p>COMPETENCIES OF THE COMMUNITY AND MEMBER STATES.  WITHOUT </p><p>CHANGING THE INSTITUTIONAL BALANCE, STREAMLINING DECISION </p><p>MAKING, ESPECIALLY WITH 25 MEMBERS, WOULD CREATE A MORE </p><p>COMPETITIVE EUROPE. </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) SCHNABEL ASKED ABOUT BERLUSCONI,S SPECIFIC GOALS. </p><p>CASTELLANETA SAID GISCARD SHOULD FOLLOW HIS LAEKEN MANDATE, </p><p>ENDING THE CONVENTION IN MARCH 2003 AND PUBLISHING HIS REPORT </p><p>2-3 MONTHS LATER.  THE ITALIAN PRESIDENCY SHOULD START WITH </p><p>THE OPENING OF THE INTER GOVERNMENTAL CONFERENCE (IGC) AND </p><p>FINALIZE RESULTS BEFORE THE END OF ITS PRESIDENCY. </p><p>HIGHLIGHTS OF THE PRESIDENCY WOULD INCLUDE THE TWO EUROPEAN </p><p>COUNCILS, WHICH WOULD BE HELD IN BRUSSELS IN ACCORDANCE WITH </p><p>EU PROPOSALS IN THE NICE TREATY, THE OPENING OF THE IGC, AND </p><p>ITS CULMINATION IN THE SIGNING OF A SECOND "TREATY OF ROME." </p><p>TO CEMENT THE INSTITUTIONAL DEAL, ITALY WAS WORKING WITH </p><p>FRANCE AND THE UK.  THE UK COULD SCUTTLE ITALY\'S TIMING IF </p><p>THEY CALLED A REFERENDUM BEFORE SIGNING, THOUGH CASTELLANETA </p><p>ADDED THAT THE SPANISH WERE ALREADY ON BOARD.  HE NOTED THAT </p><p>THE ITALIAN PRESIDENCY WOULD HAVE TO PUSH THIS APPROACH AS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  05255  03 OF 03  280907Z </p><p>THE "LARGE STATE PRESIDENCY" SCHEDULED BETWEEN GREECE AND </p><p>IRELAND.  AMBASSADOR SCHNABEL CONGRATULATED CASTELLANETA ON </p><p>ITALY,S CAREFUL PREPARATION.  CASTELLANETA NOTED THAT FOR </p><p>THE FIRST TIME IN YEARS, THERE WAS "A STABILITY IN ITALIAN </p><p>POLITICAL LIFE."  IT WAS RARE THAT AN ITALIAN GOVERNMENT </p><p>COULD BE CONFIDENT THAT IT WOULD REMAIN IN POWER 18 MONTHS </p><p>HENCE. </p><p> </p><p>TURKEY </p><p>------ </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C)  CASTELLANETA NOTED THAT BERLUSCONI FELT THE </p><p>ITALIAN-TURKISH RELATIONSHIP WAS IMPORTANT, BUT THAT THE </p><p>ISSUE HAD BEEN POLITICIZED.  HE WAS DISSATISFIED THAT NO DATE </p><p>HAD BEEN SET FOR TURKISH ACCESSION.  CASTELLANETA HOPED THE </p><p>GAERC AND SUBSEQUENT BRUSSELS SUMMIT MEETING ON OCT 24-25 </p><p>WOULD GIVE TURKEY SOME HOPE OF A DATE CERTAIN FOR ACCESSION. </p><p>EUROPEANS MUST BALANCE THEIR CONCERNS WITH TURKISH POLITICAL </p><p>REALITIES.  JUST AS IT WAS "KEEN ON TURKEY", ITALY ALSO </p><p>SUPPORTED ROMANIAN AND BULGARIAN ACCESSION BY 2007. </p><p> </p><p>BIOTECH </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>15.  (C)  ON BIOTECHNOLOGY, DCM SKODON CAUTIONED THAT WE WERE </p><p>HEADED TOWARDS A MAJOR TRADE DISPUTE WITH THE EU. </p><p>CASTELLANETA NOTED THE DEBATE REMAINED OPEN, THOUGH ITALY,S </p><p>AGRICULTURE MINISTER ALEMANNO REMAINED LESS SO.  BERLUSCONI, </p><p>WANTING TO CAPTURE THE BENEFITS OF AGRICULTURAL </p><p>BIOTECHNOLOGY, HAD ASKED ALEMANNO TO WORK TO REASSURE THE </p><p>PUBLIC USING TESTS AND SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE THAT GENETICALLY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  05255  03 OF 03  280907Z </p><p>MODIFIED PRODUCTS WERE SAFE.  AMBASSADOR SCHNABEL NOTED THAT </p><p>THE DISCUSSION ITSELF HAD GONE ON TOO LONG.  PRESSURE WAS </p><p>GROWING IN THE UNITED STATES TO TAKE SOME ACTION.  MOVEMENT </p><p>BY THE EU WOULD BE NECESSARY TO HEAD OFF A FORMAL DISPUTE. </p><p> </p><p>16. (SBU)  AMBASSADOR SCHNABEL,S OTHER MEETINGS IN ROME WILL </p><p>BE REPORTED SEPTEL.
