<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L PRAGUE 002892 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/14/2011 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PTER, AF, EZ </p><p>SUBJECT: CZECH RESPONSE: AFGHANISTAN\'S FUTURE - NEXT STEPS </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 192153 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: ACTING DEPUTY CHIEF OF MISSION JOHN J. BORIS </p><p>PER 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) ON NOVEMBER 13, WE BRIEFED THE NEW DIRECTOR OF THE </p><p>MFA\'S ASIA AND PACIFIC DEPARTMENT, IVAN JESTRAB, ON THE </p><p>POINTS IN REFTEL ON AFGHANISTAN\'S FUTURE.  JESTRAB, WHO TOOK </p><p>OVER AS DIRECTOR ON NOVEMBER 1 AFTER SERVING FOR SEVERAL </p><p>YEARS AS THE CZECH AMBASSADOR IN NEW DELHI, EXPRESSED HIS </p><p>APPRECIATION FOR THE INFORMATION AND HIS DESIRE TO CONTINUE </p><p>THE CLOSE COOPERATION OF HIS PREDECESSOR WITH THE EMBASSY. </p><p>SPEAKING MORE  GENERALLY, HE REITERATED THE STRONG SUPPORT OF </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT AND PEOPLE OF THE CZECH REPUBLIC FOR THE WAR </p><p>ON TERRORISM AND THE U.S. POLICY TOWARD AFGHANISTAN.  HE </p><p>PROMISED TO SHARE THE INFORMATION WITH OTHER KEY PERSONNEL IN </p><p>THE MFA, INCLUDING IVAN BUSNIAK, THE DIRECTOR OF THE EASTERN </p><p>EUROPE DEPARTMENT, WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR CENTRAL ASIA, AND </p><p>JOSEF KOUTSKY, WHO IS THE ACTING DIRECTOR OF THE MIDDLE EAST </p><p>AND NORTH AFRICA DEPARTMENT.  OVERALL COORDINATION OF THE </p><p>MFA\'S AFGHANISTAN POLICY, HE SAID, WAS HANDLED BY THE </p><p>DIRECTOR GENERAL FOR POLITICAL AFFAIRS, JAKUB KARFIK, A </p><p>FORMER CZECH DEPUTY CHIEF OF MISSION IN ISLAMABAD.  THE NEW </p><p>DEPUTY MINISTER FOR BILATERAL RELATIONS,   RUDOLF JINDRAK </p><p>(AND FORMER CZECH AMBASSADOR TO HUNGARY), WHO REPLACED HYNEK </p><p>KMONICEK ON NOVEMBER 1, IS FOCUSED ON HIS AREA OF EXPERTISE, </p><p>NAMELY EUROPE. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) JESTRAB EXPRESSED PESSIMISM ABOUT THE LIKELIHOOD THAT </p><p>NORTHERN ALLIANCE FORCES WOULD STOP SHORT OF KABUL.  NEWS </p><p>REPORTS ALREADY INDICATED THEY WERE ENTERING THE CAPITAL.  HE </p><p>WELCOMED ANY INFORMATION ON OUR THINKING ON THE LIKELIHOOD OF </p><p>FORMING OF COALITION GOVERNMENT AND THE POSSIBLE </p><p>PARTICIPANTS.  DURING HIS SERVICE IN INDIA, THE DIRECTOR HAD </p><p>COME TO KNOW THE NORTHERN ALLIANCE\'S AMBASSADOR TO INDIA AND </p><p>HIS WIFE AS PERSONAL FRIENDS AND FINE HUMAN BEINGS.  JESTRAB </p><p>WAS RELIEVED TO LEARN HIS FRIEND SURVIVED THE ASSASSINATION </p><p>OF MASOOD.  STILL, HE WAS SKEPTICAL WHETHER THE ALLIANCE, </p><p>WITH ITS LIMITED ETHNIC MAKEUP, COULD ENSURE THE CREATION OF </p><p>A BROAD-BASED GOVERNMENT.  THE RISK OF THE CARVING UP OF </p><p>AFGHANISTAN INTO WARRING FIEFDOMS LOOMED LARGE.  A PROLONGED </p><p>GUERRILLA WAR COULD ALSO DE-STABILIZE PAKISTAN.  IF A COUP </p><p>CAME, IT WOULD LIKELY BE LEAD BY "MEN IN BEARDS AND TURBANS" </p><p>(I.E., ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALISTS) ALLIED TO THE TALIBAN. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) WHEN ASKED ABOUT AFGHANS IN THE CZECH REPUBLIC, </p><p>JESTRAB NOTED HE HAD BEEN IN OFFICE A VERY SHORT TIME AND HAD </p><p>NOT YET HAD A CHANCE TO MEET ALL THE INTERESTED PLAYERS.  HE </p><p>STATED, HOWEVER, THAT HE WAS NOT AWARE OF ANY COUNTRYWIDE </p><p>ORGANIZATION OF AFGHANS.  MOST OF THE AFGHANS WHO WERE IN THE </p><p>COUNTRY HAD APPLIED FOR POLITICAL ASYLUM AND WERE HOPING TO </p><p>STAY IN EUROPE; THEY DID NOT, HE SAID, WANT TO ATTRACT </p><p>ATTENTION.  THE LOCAL AFGHANI EMBASSY WAS STAFFED BY A SINGLE </p><p>DIPLOMAT WHOSE ABILITY TO INFLUENCE EVENTS OR POLICY WAS </p><p>MINIMAL.  WE AGREED TO REMAIN IN CLOSE CONTACT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STAPLETON </p><p></p></div>
