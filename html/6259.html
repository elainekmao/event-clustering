<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 001432 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/11/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PREL, PGOV, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDANIAN MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS SETS UP </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS DIRECTORATE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: ACTING DCM DOUGLAS A. SILLIMAN.  REASONS: 1.5 (b) and (d </p><p>) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p> SUMMARY </p><p> ------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently announced </p><p>formation of a "Human Rights Directorate" within the MFA.  On </p><p>March 5, MFA Human Rights Officer Bisher Khasawneh told </p><p>PolCouns and PolOff the MFA wants the new directorate to </p><p>"have teeth", and is committed to providing HR training for </p><p>as many as six Jordanian diplomats.  Khasawneh asked for </p><p>Embassy assistance in facilitating this training.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  On March 5, PolCouns and PolOff met with Bisher </p><p>Khasawneh, newly appointed MFA officer (note: Khasawneh is </p><p>also the MFA\'s Director of the Information and Public </p><p>Relations Bureau).  Khasawneh said FM Muasher wants the HR </p><p>Directorate to "have teeth".  It is designed to work </p><p>initially with international NGOs and Embassies here in </p><p>Amman.  Khasawneh hopes to be able to train up to six </p><p>Jordanian diplomats at private institutions in either Europe </p><p>or the US, and asked if the USG would be able to assist </p><p>financially.  PolCouns said we would take a look at our </p><p>programming funds, but advised that funding may be difficult, </p><p>especially since enrollment in US private institutions is </p><p>particularly expensive.  Khasawneh took the point, and said </p><p>he is willing to consider alternatives such as training at </p><p>the Embassy, perhaps by an FSI HR expert. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  The MFA\'s initiative to set up a HR Directorate is a </p><p>good step, and in line with the GOJ\'s recently announced HR </p><p>Commission, as well as a recent request by the Ministry of </p><p>Social Development to assist with HR training of their staff. </p><p> We will look into avenues through which we can help </p><p>facilitate training for the MFA\'s HR Directorate, including </p><p>possible use of the international visitors program, voluntary </p><p>visitors program, or MEPI funds. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
