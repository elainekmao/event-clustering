<p>UNCLAS HARARE 000063 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>AF/PD FOR COX, ROBERTSON, SCHLACHTER, AF/S FOR KRAFT, AF/P, </p><p>INR/R/MR, NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ZI, PREL, PHUM </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REPORT: TWO CONTROVERSIAL BILLS TO BE TABLED </p><p>IN PARLIAMENT THIS WEEK; HARARE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.   TWO CONTROVERSIAL BILLS - THE ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND </p><p>    PROTECTION OF PRIVACY BILL AND THE PUBLIC ORDER AND </p><p>    SECURITY BILL (POSB) - ARE PREPARED FOR TABLING IN </p><p>    PARLIAMENT THIS WEEK.  PARLIAMENT RESUMES BUSINESS ON </p><p>    JANUARY 8 AFTER A THREE-WEEK BREAK.  WHILE THE ACCESS </p><p>    TO INFORMATION BILL SEEKS "TO REGULATE THE OPERATIONS </p><p>    OF THE MEDIA, ESPECIALLY THE PRIVATE PRESS," THE POSB </p><p>    COMES BACK TO THE HOUSE SEEKING TOUGHER MEASURES TO </p><p>    DEAL WITH "ACTS OF TERRORISM AND PUBLIC VIOLENCE."  THE </p><p>    SAME BILL WAS DEBATED AND PASSED BY PARLIAMENT THREE </p><p>    YEARS AGO, BUT PRESIDENT ROBERT MUGABE DECLINED TO SIGN </p><p>    IT INTO LAW.  THE TWO BILLS HAVE BEEN CRITICIZED AS </p><p>    "UNCONSTITUTIONAL." </p><p> </p><p>2.   ACCORDING TO THE ZIMBABWE CHAIRPERSON OF THE MEDIA </p><p>    INSTITUTE OF SOUTHERN AFRICA (MISA), RAYHANA MASTERS-SMITH, </p><p>    CONSTITUTIONAL LITIGATION AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT IS ON THE </p><p>    CARDS IF PARLIAMENT PASSES THE ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND </p><p>    PROTECTION OF PRIVACY BILL.  AMONG THE ORGANIZATIONS READY </p><p>    TO FILE THEIR SUITS THE MOMENT THE BILL IS PRONOUNCED LAW </p><p>    INLCUDE MISA, THE LAW SOCIETY OF ZIMBABWE (LDZ), THE </p><p>    FEDERATION OF AFRICAN MEDIA WOMEN OF ZIMBABWE (FAMWZ), THE </p><p>    LEGAL RESOURCES FOUNDATION (LRF), AND THE HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>    LAWYERS OF ZIMBABWE (HRLZ).  THE BILL, WHICH WAS GAZETTED </p><p>    BY THE GOVERNMENT ON NOVEMBER 30 LAST YEAR, HAS BEEN </p><p>    ROUNDLY CRITICIZED AS "UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND DESIGNED TO GAG </p><p>    THE OPERATIONS OF THE PRESS, ESPECIALLY THE PRIVATE MEDIA." </p><p>    THE ARGUMENT BY THE CIVIC AND MEDIA ORGANIZATIONS IS THAT </p><p>    WHILE THE BILL OSTENSIBLY PURPORTS TO GIVE THE PEOPLE, AND </p><p>    THE MEDIA IN PARTICULAR, THE RIGHT TO INFORMATION HELD BY </p><p>    PUBLIC BODIES, IN REALITY IT SUFFOCATES THE MEDIA AND </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00063  081055Z </p><p>    GUARANTEES TOTAL SILENCE ON ISSUES OF PUBLIC CONCERN. </p><p> </p><p>3.   THE TWO BILLS ARE EXPECTED TO BE FAST-TRACKED THROUGH </p><p>    PARLIAMENT THIS WEEK, AS THE RULING ZANU PF GOVERNMENT HAS </p><p>    THE REQUIRED SINGLE MAJORITY TO PASS ANY PIECE OF </p><p>    LEGISLATION. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
