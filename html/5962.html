<p>UNCLAS ANKARA 001275 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA </p><p>STATE FOR EB/TPP/MTA/IPC - WILSON AND EUR/SE </p><p>DEPT PASS USTR FOR DBIRDSEY/KALVAREZ, PATENT AND </p><p>TRADEMARK OFFICE FOR URBAN, LIBRARY OF CONGRESS FOR TEPP </p><p>USDOC FOR ITA/MAC/DDEFALCO </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, KIPR, TU, USTR </p><p>SUBJECT:  2003 SPECIAL 301 REVIEW:  RECOMMENDATION TO </p><p>MAINTAIN TURKEY ON THE WATCH LIST </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF:  02 ANKARA 8635 AND PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Turkey took some limited steps to improve </p><p>intellectual property protection in 2002, notably by </p><p>suspending a problematic broadcast regulation and by </p><p>forming provincial committees to improve enforcement. </p><p>However, piracy of optical media, books and other </p><p>products remains widespread and the GOT has not </p><p>addressed key issues facing U.S. pharmaceuticals </p><p>companies, including data exclusivity and price </p><p>discrimination against imports.  Overall, IPR protection </p><p>has not improved in most respects in the last year, but </p><p>it has not deteriorated either.  Embassy recommends </p><p>maintaining Turkey on the Watch List.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Limited Progress on IPR </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) There were positive developments in IPR </p><p>protection in 2002, all on the copyright side.  The </p><p>Ministry of Culture allowed a registration it had </p><p>previously granted to a firm named Planet to be revoked; </p><p>Planet had obtained a false registration from the </p><p>Ministry to import DVDs.  The Turkish Council of State </p><p>also suspended application of compulsory licensing </p><p>provisions of the GOT\'s broadcast regulation.  The GOT </p><p>formed provincial committees to improve copyright </p><p>enforcement, and Istanbul-based representatives of the </p><p>IPR industries report that that provincial committee has </p><p>taken concrete steps to curb piracy.  Establishment of </p><p>specialized intellectual property courts is another </p><p>positive step. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Enforcement and Data Exclusivity Problems Remain </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) While the motion picture and software industries </p><p>have had some successes in obtaining the cooperation of </p><p>Turkish law enforcement authorities, music industry </p><p>representatives have consistently told us that </p><p>enforcement has not improved for their products and </p><p>IIPA\'s most recent Special 301 submission show a piracy </p><p>rate of 75 percent for music and records.  Book </p><p>publishers are also experiencing high rates of piracy </p><p>and DVD piracy appeared in 2002.  Industry </p><p>representatives claim that the provincial enforcement </p><p>committees have been active only in Istanbul (although </p><p>this province accounts for the majority of some of these </p><p>firms\' sales in Turkey).  Trademark holders also </p><p>criticize enforcement of their rights as deficient, </p><p>claiming that Turkey is one of the world\'s largest </p><p>exporters of counterfeit goods.  The GOT has not changed </p><p>Health Ministry regulations which fail to provide data </p><p>exclusivity for pharmaceuticals, disputing the U.S. view </p><p>that this is required by TRIPS, nor has it revised </p><p>regulations to remove discriminatory pricing practices </p><p>applied to pharmaceuticals imports. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Recommendation </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Despite heavy lobbying on copyright and </p><p>pharmaceuticals issues by the Ambassador and other </p><p>Mission elements, the previous GOT took only limited </p><p>action to improve the IPR climate in 2002, and did not </p><p>address data exclusivity.  Our dialogue with the new </p><p>government elected in November 2002 has been dominated </p><p>by foreign policy crises.  We have therefore not been </p><p>able to establish the high-level dialogue that is </p><p>warranted on this issue. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) While we recognize that Turkey has not made the </p><p>progress we had hoped for on IPR protection this year, </p><p>Embassy recommends maintaining Turkey on the Watch List. </p><p>We strongly recommend that, after the current situation </p><p>in the region is resolved, Washington ratchet up its </p><p>engagement with the GOT on this issue, possibly </p><p>including a visit to Ankara by an IPR delegation. </p><p>Pearson# </p><p></p></div>
