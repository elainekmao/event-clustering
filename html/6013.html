Narayan Singh Pun, Minister of Physical Planning and </p><p>Works and government-appointed peace talks coordinator, said </p><p>the peace process will take time but can be accomplished </p><p>without the participation of other political parties if </p><p>necessary.  Pun also said he expects to hold talks with the </p><p>Maoists within the next few weeks.  The National Human </p><p>Rights Commission (NHRC) has called for information about </p><p>the peace process to be shared with political parties and </p><p>the people of Nepal as well.  Girija Prasad Koirala, the </p><p>President of Nepali Congress (NC), criticized the GON for </p><p>failing to announce a code of conduct or its negotiating </p><p>team.  Maoist leaders in town for negotiations with Pun </p><p>continue to meet with major party leaders.  Maoist leader </p><p>Prachanda warned that his party was ready to resume the </p><p>armed conflict if the peace talks failed and criticized the </p><p>Government of Nepal (GON) for violating the ceasefire by </p><p>allowing security operations, including arrests of Maoist </p><p>cadres, to continue.  Colonel Deepak Gurung, the Royal Nepal </p><p>Army (RNA) spokesman, says the army welcomes the ceasefire, </p><p>but is also prepared to resume fighting if the peace talks </p><p>fail. </p><p> </p><p>2.  Summary Continued.  The Maoists continue to hold mass </p><p>political meetings in the countryside.  Maoist prisoners in </p><p>a Kathmandu jail, who have already staged protests and sit- </p><p>ins, have threatened to go on a hunger strike if the GON </p><p>does not meet demands for the release of imprisoned cadres. </p><p>Maoists reportedly have issued a death threat to a </p><p>journalist who wrote an unfavorable article about the </p><p>insurgents, and confined another to his village.  A man </p><p>accused of stealing was shot and killed by the Maoists on </p><p>February 22 in Dang District.  Investigations into the </p><p>January 26 murders of Krishna Mohan Shrestha, Inspector </p><p>General of the Armed Police Force, his wife and bodyguard </p><p>(Ref A), continue.  Maoists reportedly have admitted </p><p>mistakenly killing two children and seriously injuring </p><p>another at a primary school in northwestern Baglung District </p><p>on February 18 (Ref B), but denied other reports that they </p><p>are responsible for increased incidents of looting.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>PEACE PROCESS WILL TAKE TIME; </p><p>GON READY TO MOVE FORWARD ON ITS OWN </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3.  Narayan Singh Pun, Minister of Physical Planning and </p><p>Works and government-appointed peace talks coordinator, said </p><p>on February 26 that peace talks were an ongoing, complex </p><p>process, which will take time to develop.  Minister Pun told </p><p>reporters that peace talks between the GON and the Maoists, </p><p>which will require much patience and skill, might begin </p><p>toward the end of March.  Pun was also quoted in the local </p><p>press as saying he communicates by telephone with the </p><p>Maoists, including Dr. Baburam Bhattarai, the leader of the </p><p>Maoist negotiating team, as often as five times a day. </p><p> </p><p>4.  Minister Pun reportedly said that the GON would first </p><p>hold talks with the Maoists, and then invite political </p><p>parties and representatives of civil society to participate, </p><p>but that peace was possible without participation from the </p><p>other political parties.  Speaking at the Reporters\' Club on </p><p>February 26, he asserted that a "thousand things" had </p><p>already been achieved, and the GON\'s patience was wearing </p><p>thin with criticism by the political parties.  According to </p><p>Pun, the GON was committed to fulfilling the interests of </p><p>the people "on its own" if necessary. </p><p> </p><p>DEMAND FOR CODE OF CONDUCT DETAILS </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>5.  The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) criticized </p><p>both the GON and the Maoists for failing to make details of </p><p>the ceasefire and code of conduct public.  Nayan Bahadur </p><p>Khatri, Chairman of the NHRC, said that details of the peace </p><p>process should not be limited only to the GON and the </p><p>Maoists, but should include other political parties and the </p><p>people of Nepal.  According to press reports, Minister </p><p>Narayan Singh Pun, government-appointed coordinator for the </p><p>peace talks, said on February 21 that both sides had </p><p>exchanged drafts for a code of conduct, but refused to give </p><p>details, saying they would be made public soon.   According </p><p>to press accounts, Minister Pun met informally with Krishna </p><p>Bahadur Mahara, a member of the Maoist negotiating team, on </p><p>February 27 to finalize the code of conduct, but there were </p><p>disagreements over the re-deployment of the army. </p><p> </p><p>6.  The NHRC also denounced the GON and the Maoists for </p><p>failing to respond to the draft it submitted to both sides </p><p>outlining its own proposed code of conduct.  The draft had </p><p>called for a revocation of the Terrorist and Disruptive </p><p>Activities Act, an immediate end to violence, and a halt to </p><p>the use of weapons by the insurgents and security personnel. </p><p> </p><p>7.  Girija Prasad Koirala, the President of Nepali Congress </p><p>(NC), said his party hoped the ceasefire would turn into </p><p>lasting peace, but questioned the seriousness of the GON. </p><p>Koirala, speaking at a press conference on February 27, </p><p>accused the GON of creating further confusion by its refusal </p><p>to make public a code of conduct, and criticized its failure </p><p>to announce a negotiating team.  Koirala said the most </p><p>desirable solution to the current problem should come from </p><p>the framework of the current constitution, and should not </p><p>merely be an agreement between only two sides.  Koirala also </p><p>told the audience of foreign and national news media that </p><p>his party was not willing to recognize the government under </p><p>Prime Minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand, nor the Royal Act </p><p>that dissolved the Deuba Government last year. </p><p> </p><p>PRACHANDA READY TO FIGHT TO THE END </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  Maoist leader Prachanda issued a statement on February </p><p>25, declaring that the Maoists would "fight to the end" if </p><p>the GON did not create a conducive environment for peace </p><p>talks.  Prachanda accused the GON of violating the ceasefire </p><p>not only by continuing to arrest his cadres and carrying out </p><p>search and patrol activities, but also by allegedly </p><p>intensifying such operations.  Prachanda criticized the GON </p><p>for its delay in preparing a negotiating team and for its </p><p>failure to take any "concrete or positive steps." </p><p> </p><p>9.  Prachanda has continued to contact members of political </p><p>parties, urging them to be involved with the peace process. </p><p>Girija Prasad Koirala, President of Nepali Congress (NC), </p><p>reportedly was contacted by Prachanda on February 25. </p><p>Koirala said the Maoist leader told him to play a key role </p><p>in the talks and reiterated that there had been no secret </p><p>agreements made prior to the announcement of the ceasefire. </p><p>A diplomatic colleague also reports that Maoists have </p><p>approached his embassy, asking it to arrange a meeting for </p><p>them with a number of European missions. </p><p> </p><p>10.  Krishna Bahadur Mahara and Dinanath Sharma, members of </p><p>the Maoist negotiating team for the peace talks, met with </p><p>former Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba.  According to </p><p>Deuba, Mahara and Sharma asked for help in generating public </p><p>support.  Deuba told the local press that his party would </p><p>neither help the Maoists nor fight against them, but </p><p>expressed concern over their sincerity and the possibility </p><p>that the insurgents were using the ceasefire to rebuild </p><p>their forces (Note:  It was under Deuba\'s government that </p><p>the Maoists walked out of the third round of peace talks </p><p>last year and launched surprise attacks on army </p><p>installations.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>RNA READY TO BATTLE IF TALKS FAIL </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  Colonel Deepak Gurung, spokesman for the Royal Nepal </p><p>Army (RNA), said the RNA is committed to and will abide by </p><p>the ceasefire, but was prepared to fight a "decisive war" </p><p>with Maoist insurgents if necessary.  Gurung, speaking on </p><p>February 25 at the RNA\'s first press conference since the </p><p>ceasefire was announced, said the army welcomed the </p><p>ceasefire, but was also prepared if the peace talks failed. </p><p>Gurung said the RNA would not spare anybody if they are </p><p>attacked, and expressed confidence that the insurgents did </p><p>not have the capabilities to win against the RNA.  He also </p><p>said the army would not return to the barracks until peace </p><p>is completely restored. </p><p> </p><p>12.  Gurung described some of the ongoing projects the RNA </p><p>is currently involved in, including the reconstruction of </p><p>buildings, school and health facilities that were destroyed </p><p>during the insurgency.  According to Gurung, the RNA is also </p><p>running health camps in the mid-western regions, which </p><p>provide medical treatment to Maoists as well as civilians. </p><p>The army\'s barracks in Dang, Achham and Arghakhanchi </p><p>Districts, which were destroyed by Maoist attacks, have also </p><p>been rebuilt. </p><p> </p><p>PRISONERS THREATEN HUNGER STRIKE </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  Prisoners in Nakkhu Jail in Kathmandu have threatened </p><p>on February 25 to go on a hunger strike if the GON does not </p><p>meet the Maoists\' demands for the release of its imprisoned </p><p>cadres.  The prisoners, who are already staging sit-ins and </p><p>protests within the jails, said they would begin hunger </p><p>strikes if their list of demands, sent to Prime Minister </p><p>Lokendra Bahadur Chand through facilitators, was not taken </p><p>seriously.  The memorandum insists the GON create a </p><p>conducive environment for peace talks, release information </p><p>on the whereabouts of missing Maoist cadres, and stop </p><p>propaganda against the Maoists.  (Note: Government officials </p><p>have explained publicly that Maoist cadres who have been </p><p>arrested for serious crimes cannot be released without </p><p>following formal legal procedures.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>14.  In Jhapa District, police allegedly rearrested nine </p><p>suspected Maoists immediately after they were released from </p><p>the Jhapa Jail.  According to press reports, there are forty- </p><p>two suspected Maoists still imprisoned in Jhapa. </p><p> </p><p>MAOIST THREATEN JOURNALIST </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>15.  Maoists reportedly have issued a death threat to a </p><p>journalist who wrote an unfavorable article about the </p><p>insurgents.  Rabin Prasad Thapalia, a journalist with the </p><p>weekly Ruprekha, blamed the insurgents for creating widows </p><p>and orphans, and preventing people from celebrating </p><p>religious festivals.  The Maoists, in turn, threatened to </p><p>"terminate" Thapalia if he did not retract his story and </p><p>publicly apologize.  According to Thapalia, he printed an </p><p>apology in the paper, but the insurgents said it was </p><p>inadequate.  The insurgents allegedly have warned Thapalia\'s </p><p>family that if he returns to his village in central Nuwakot </p><p>District he will be killed. </p><p> </p><p>16.  According to reports from Accham District, Maoists have </p><p>confined a journalist to his village in Darna.  Deepak </p><p>Bahadur Thapa has been restricted to his village and cannot </p><p>leave without permission from the Maoists. No reason was </p><p>given for his confinement. </p><p>17.  The Reporters\' Club Nepal, a local organization of </p><p>journalists, issued a press release on February 26 </p><p>denouncing the Maoists for their treatment of journalists. </p><p>Rishi Dhamala, President of the organization, said </p><p>journalists should not be threatened or punished for what </p><p>they report, and that both the Maoists and the GON should </p><p>respect the role the press plays in the peace process. </p><p> </p><p>IG KILLED BY MAOIST SPECIAL FORCES </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>18.  A report submitted on February 21 by the team </p><p>investigating the murders of Krishna Mohan Shrestha, </p><p>Inspector General of the Armed Police Force, his wife and </p><p>bodyguard (Ref A), states that a special task force of </p><p>Maoists was responsible for the murder.  The report states </p><p>that seven people were involved with the planning of the </p><p>murder, while four directly carried it out.  The insurgents </p><p>allegedly had planned the murder for some time, monitoring </p><p>Shrestha\'s activities and taking note of his daily routine. </p><p> </p><p>MAOISTS ADMIT KILLING; PLEDGE HELP </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>19.  Maoists reportedly have admitted to mistakenly killing </p><p>two children and seriously injuring another at a primary </p><p>school in northwestern Baglung District on February 18 (Ref </p><p>B).  The insurgents have pledged to help the injured child </p><p>with medical treatment and also gave twenty-six dollars to </p><p>each of the guardians of the deceased children.  Villagers </p><p>said, however, that the insurgents refused to give the </p><p>corpses to the families and instead buried them near a local </p><p>stream.  Villagers later helped to dig up the children\'s </p><p>bodies so that the families could perform a proper burial. </p><p> </p><p>20.  Maoists in Parbat District issued a statement on </p><p>February 22 denying that they are responsible for looting </p><p>and extortion in the district.   The insurgents have also </p><p>warned criminals not to call themselves Maoists.  Looting </p><p>incidents reportedly have increased in Tanahun District as </p><p>well, despite the ceasefire.  Security forces suspect that </p><p>Maoists are involved.  Maoists are also suspected in the </p><p>February 22 shooting death of a man in Dang District, who </p><p>they accused of stealing. </p><p> </p><p>WAR WITH THE PALACE? </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>21.  Maoists held a mass meeting in Bara District on </p><p>February 26 where they reportedly proclaimed that the war in </p><p>the future would be between them and the Royal Palace.  The </p><p>insurgents said the ultimate goal is to gain control over </p><p>the central government.  Jamin Prakash Shah, District </p><p>Commander, and other speakers at the meeting said that the </p><p>GON had failed to form a negotiating team because it is not </p><p>serious about the talks. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
