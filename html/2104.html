ANOTHER YOUNG </p><p>IRANIAN IMMIGRANT VISA APPLICANT STATED THAT MANY YOUNG </p><p>IRANIANS ARE TIRED OF IRANIAN PRESIDENT KHATAMI AND DO NOT </p><p>BELIEVE THAT KHATAMI CAN BRING ABOUT POLITICAL REFORM.  AFTER </p><p>A TRIP TO TEHRAN, A U.S. BORN AMCIT TOLD CONOFF THAT TEHRAN </p><p>APPEARED ECONOMICALLY BUSTLING.  SHE NOTED THAT TEHRAN LOOKED </p><p>CLEAN AND THAT THERE WERE SEVERAL NEW BUILDINGS UNDER </p><p>CONSTRUCTION; FRUIT AND VEGETABLES WERE PLENTIFUL IN THE </p><p>LOCAL STORES.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>IRANIAN SYMPATHY OVER ATTACKS </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) NUMEROUS IRANIAN VISA APPLICANTS HAVE EXPRESSED THEIR </p><p>DEEP SYMPATHIES TO CONOFF IN THE DAYS AND WEEKS AFTER THE </p><p>TERRORIST ATTACKS AT THE WORLD TRADE CENTER AND PENTAGON. </p><p>BEFORE BEGINNING THEIR INTERVIEWS, NEARLY ALL IRANIAN VISA </p><p>APPLICANTS TAKE A MOMENT TO EXPRESS THEIR SORROW OVER THE </p><p>ATTACKS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) ONE APPLICANT CLAIMED TO HAVE BEEN PRESENT AT A </p><p>CANDLELIGHT VIGIL HELD IN TEHRAN DAYS AFTER THE TERRORIST </p><p>ATTACKS.  A YOUNG MALE FROM ESFAHAN, HE LIFTED HIS SHIRT TO </p><p>SHOW SCARS FROM A WHIPPING HE RECEIVED AND SCARS ON HIS </p><p>WRISTS AND ANKLES FROM BEING TIED TO A WALL.  THE APPLICANT </p><p>CLAIMED THAT HE WAS IN A CENTRAL AREA OF TEHRAN WITH </p><p>APPROXIMATELY 600 MEN AND WOMEN OBSERVING THE QUIET </p><p>CANDLELIGHT VIGIL.  HE INDICATED THAT THREE BASIJIS GRABBED </p><p>HIM, BLINDFOLDED HIM AND HELD HIM HOSTAGE FOR SIX DAYS.  THE </p><p>BASIJIS BEAT WITH A TELEPHONE CORD FOR TWO DAYS AND ALLEGEDLY </p><p>ACCUSED HIM OF FOMENTING REVOLUTION. THE APPLICANT STATED </p><p>THAT ORDINARY IRANIANS WERE APPALLED AT THE TERRORIST </p><p>INCIDENT IN THE U.S. AND WANTED TO DEMONSTRATE THEIR </p><p>SOLIDARITY AGAINST VIOLENCE.  THE APPLICANT COULD NOT </p><p>INDICATE HOW MANY OTHERS HAD BEEN CAUGHT BY ROAMING GANGS OF </p><p>BASIJI VIGILANTES. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>IRANIAN PRESIDENT LOSING LUSTER </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  CONOFF QUERIED ANOTHER YOUNG IRANIAN IMMIGRANT VISA </p><p>APPLICANT REGARDING POPULAR VIEWS OF IRANIAN PRESIDENT </p><p>MOHAMMED KHATAMI.  THE APPLICANT STATED IN PERFECT ENGLISH </p><p>THAT MANY YOUNG IRANIANS ARE TIRED OF THE LACK OF POLITICAL </p><p>REFORMS.  MANY YOUNG PEOPLE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT KHATAMI CAN </p><p>TRULY CHANGE THE CURRENT POLITICAL SITUATION.  THE APPLICANT </p><p>STATED THAT YOUNG PEOPLE FEEL DISILLUSIONED AND BETRAYED BY </p><p>THE LACK OF PROGRESS BY KHATAMI.  ASKED ABOUT RELIGIOUS </p><p>LEADER KHAMANEI, THE APPLICANT SAID NOTHING.  ON POPULAR </p><p>VIEWS REGARDING THE U.S. BOMBINGS IN AFGHANISTAN, THE </p><p>APPLICANT STATED THAT IRANIANS DO NOT CONDONE VIOLENCE.  HE </p><p>ADDED THAT MANY IRANIANS HAD NO STRONG FEELINGS TOWARD THE </p><p>AFGHANS.  INSTEAD, PEOPLE ARE MORE INTERESTED IN DAILY </p><p>SURVIVAL IN A WEAK ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) MANY YOUNG VISA APPLICANTS INDICATED TO CONOFF THAT </p><p>LIFE IN IRAN IS COMFORTABLE.  MOST LIVE AT HOME WITH THEIR </p><p>PARENTS AND ARE PUTTING OFF GETTING MARRIED.  MANY IRANIAN </p><p>STUDENTS ARE NOT QUICK TO CRITICIZE THEIR COUNTRY OR ECONOMY </p><p>AND RESPOND THAT LIFE IS FINE.  UNDERLYING THIS SENTIMENT, </p><p>HOWEVER, IS A LARGE NUMBER OF EDUCATED STUDENTS THAT ARE </p><p>APPLYING TO GRADUATE PROGRAMS IN THE U.S.  MANY </p><p>UNIVERSITY-EDUCATED STUDENTS SAID THEY ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN </p><p>WORK IN IRAN AFTER GRADUATING AND VIEW CONTINUED STUDIES IN </p><p>THE U.S. AS AN ESCAPE, EVEN IF THEY RETURN TO IRAN AFTER </p><p>FINISHING. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>OUTSIDER\'S VIEW OF TEHRAN LIFE </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) A U.S. BORN AMERICAN CITIZEN REPORTED THAT TEHRAN </p><p>APPEARED ECONOMICALLY BUSTLING AND WAS OTHERWISE RELATIVELY </p><p>CALM.  IN TEHRAN FOR SEVERAL WEEKS FINALIZING ADOPTION </p><p>PROCEEDINGS FOR A STEPCHILD WITH HER IRANIAN BORN U.S. </p><p>CITIZEN HUSBAND,  SHE STATED THAT DURING HER TRIP, WHICH TOOK </p><p>HER TO MANY GOVERNMENT AND LOCAL OFFICES IN CENTRAL TEHRAN, </p><p>SHE RECEIVED GOOD TREATMENT AND THAT PEOPLE WERE GENERALLY </p><p>"NICE."  SHE NOTED THAT TEHRAN APPEARED RELATIVELY CLEAN AND </p><p>THAT THERE WERE SEVERAL NEW BUILDINGS BEING CONSTRUCTED. </p><p>MANY OTHER IRANIAN VISA APPLICANTS HAVE CONFIRMED THAT TEHRAN </p><p>HAS SEVERAL LARGE BUILDINGS BEING BUILT.  THE AMCIT STATED </p><p>THAT DURING HER TRIP THE LOCAL WATER WAS TURNED OFF IN </p><p>DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE CITY DURING THE WEEK.  THE HIGH-RISE </p><p>BUILDING WHERE SHE WAS STAYING, HOWEVER, HAD ITS OWN WATER </p><p>SUPPLY AND DID NOT SUFFER FROM THE CUTOFFS.  SHE INDICATED </p><p>THAT THE LOCAL IRANIANS SHE MET APPEARED HAPPY AND THAT THERE </p><p>WAS PLENTY OF FOOD, FRUIT AND VEGETABLES IN THE LOCAL STORES. </p><p>HER HUSBAND NOTED THAT LOCAL POLICE ONLY HARASSED TAXI </p><p>DRIVERS, STOPPING THEM AND EXTORTING SMALL BRIBES.  THEY BOTH </p><p>ADDED THAT ONLY ONCE DID THEY FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE TRAVELING </p><p>AROUND THE CITY.  AT ONE POINT IN THE TRIP, THEY LEFT A LOCAL </p><p>NEIGHBORHOOD AREA AFTER POLICE TOLD THEM THAT SOME UNIVERSITY </p><p>STUDENTS WERE DEMONSTRATING AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
