<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 000400 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, EB/CBED, EB/ESC, EUR/SE, NEA/NGA </p><p>STATE PASS NSC FOR QUANRUD AND BRYZA </p><p>USDOC FOR 4212/ITA/MAC/OEURA/CPD/DDEFALCO </p><p>USDOE FOR PUMPHREY/ROSSI </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/16/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ENRG, ECON, EPET, ETTC, IZ, AJ, GG, KZ, TU, UNSC </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKISH OFFICIALS QUESTION IRAQ IMPACT ON ENERGY </p><p>INTERESTS </p><p> </p><p>Classified by DCM Robert Deutsch, Reason 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary:  Turkish officials have begun to ask about </p><p>the potential impact of an Iraq operation on Turkish energy </p><p>interests, raising with us the possible effect on BTC, Shah </p><p>Deniz, the Kirkuk-Ceyhan pipeline, and Turkey\'s oil supply. </p><p>BOTAS is worried about the potential impact on Iskenderun </p><p>port, where all BTC pipe is scheduled to be delivered and </p><p>stored.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Recent conversations with and quotes from Turkish </p><p>government officials indicate that they are starting to focus </p><p>more on the potential impact of an Iraq operation on Turkish </p><p>energy interests.  In his December 27 meeting with Treasury </p><p>U/S Taylor and U/S Grossman, State Minister Babacan expressed </p><p>concern about the potential impact of an Iraq operation on </p><p>the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) and Shah Deniz pipelines, as </p><p>well as on the Kirkuk-Ceyhan oil pipeline.  Other GOT </p><p>officials have expressed concern about the possibility or an </p><p>interruption in oil supplies. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) BOTAS General Manager Bildaci asked econoff January 6 </p><p>if there was anything the U.S. could share regarding the </p><p>potential impact on Iskenderun port in the event of an Iraq </p><p>operation.  Bildaci noted that delivery of pipe for the BTC </p><p>pipeline is scheduled to begin in mid-February and continue </p><p>throughout 2003.  All pipe is scheduled to be delivered and </p><p>stored at Iskenderun port.  Bildaci said that BTC Co had </p><p>asked BOTAS to agree to use other ports for pipe delivery and </p><p>storage in the case of an Iraq operation.  He said agreeing </p><p>to this proposal would involve delays, contractual issues, </p><p>higher costs, and other operational issues.  On the other </p><p>hand, Bildaci said, if an Iraq operation resulted in </p><p>restrictions on his use of Iskenderun port, he would face the </p><p>same problems. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) We told Bildaci we could not assess the potential </p><p>impact of an Iraq operation in a particular port for him, </p><p>recommending that he consult with Turkish MFA and military </p><p>officials.  Regarding concerns about an interruption in oil </p><p>supply, we note that, according to the International Energy </p><p>Agency( IEA), as of October 1, 2002, Turkey\'s emergency oil </p><p>reserves were at 96 days of net import coverage (in days of </p><p>2001 Net Oil Imports), surpassing IEA\'s recommended net </p><p>import coverage of 90 days.  Ministry of Energy officials </p><p>claim that Turkey is currently at a net import coverage of </p><p>approximately 104 days. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Comment:  The GOT may be concerned about a possible </p><p>cut-off of Middle East Oil, but they appear to have adequate </p><p>reserves to cover all but the most pessimistic scenarios. </p><p>BOTAS has a clear interest in keeping BTC costs down -- if </p><p>the price tag comes in under the USD 1.4 billion turnkey </p><p>contract fee, BOTAS keeps the profits.  Still, even though </p><p>Bildaci is motivated in part by the bottom line, his concerns </p><p>about possible delays in BTC likely are genuine.  End comment. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
