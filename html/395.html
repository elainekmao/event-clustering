<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 RIYADH 06329 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, MARR, MOPS, SA, US </p><p>SUBJECT:  FAHD OUT OF THE CLOSET </p><p> </p><p>REF:  (A) RIYADH 6198; (B) RIYADH 6266 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY: IN A NATIONWIDE SPEECH AT 1400 LOCAL </p><p>TIME TODAY (1100 GMT, AUGUST 9) KING FAHD PUT SAUDI </p><p>ARABIA FOUR SQUARE ON THE SIDE OF THOSE COUNTRIES </p><p>CONDEMNING THE IRAQI INVASION AND CALLING FOR IRAQ TO </p><p>WITHDRAW FROM KUWAIT IMMEDIATELY AND UNCONDITIONALLY. </p><p>FAHD ALSO PUBLICLY THANKED THE "U.S., UK AND OTHER </p><p>FRIENDLY COUNTRIES" WHICH ARE RESPONDING TO SAUDI </p><p>ARABIA\'S CALL FOR DEFENSIVE MILITARY ASSISTANCE.  FAHD\'S </p><p>SPEECH IS UNPRECEDENTED FOR ITS CANDOR AND </p><p>STRAIGHTFORWARD PRAISE OF TWO WESTERN COUNTRIES.  IT </p><p>SHOWS HOW MUCH THE CURRENT CRISIS HAS CHANGED SAUDI </p><p>ARABIA AND THE MIDDLE EAST.  WE ALSO BELIEVE THE SPEECH </p><p>WILL ENABLE FAHD TO MANAGE DOMESTIC REACTION TO THE </p><p>INTRODUCTION OF U.S. TROOPS FOR SOME TIME, BUT NOT </p><p>INDEFINITELY.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) THIS AFTERNOON\'S NEWS BROADCAST ON SAUDI </p><p>TELEVISION CARRIED A PERSONAL STATEMENT BY KING FAHD ON </p><p>THE CURRENT CRISIS.  WEARING TINTED GLASSES AND CASTING </p><p>HIS EYES DOWNWARD AT HIS PREPARED TET THROUGHOUT, FAHD </p><p>DELIVERED HIS BRIEF (APPROXIMATELY 10 MINUTE) SPEECH </p><p>RAPIDLY, IN A SOMBER TONE OF VOICE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) WE WILL RELY ON FBIS TO PROVIDE THE FULL TEXT OF </p><p>FAHD\'S REMARKS.  THE POINTS WE WISH TO HIGHLIGHT ARE: </p><p> </p><p>--    FAHD BEGAN BY REVIEWING THE EVENTS LEADING UP TO </p><p>AUGUST 2, STRESSING ALL THE EFFORTS (BILATERAL CONTACTS, </p><p>JEDDAH MEETING ETC.) WHICH SAUDI ARABIA UNDERTOOK FOR THE </p><p>COMMON GOOD TO SETTLE THE DISPUTE BETWEEN IRAQ AND KUWAIT </p><p>AND TO PREVENT AN OUTBREAK OF VIOLENCE; </p><p> </p><p>--    FAHD THEN TURNED TO THE IRAQI INVASION ITSELF.  HE </p><p>CALLED IT THE "MOST VICIOUS" (ABSHAA) AGGRESSION OF </p><p>MODERN ARAB HISTORY AND NOTED THAT IT HAD PRECIPITATED A </p><p>CRISIS FOR THE WHOLE WORLD. </p><p> </p><p>--    NEXT, FAHD ENUMERATED THE CALLS BY THE UNSC, ARAB </p><p>LEAGUE, GCC ETC. FOR IRAQI WITHDRAWAL FROM KUWAIT </p><p>IMMEDIATELY AND UNCONDITIONALLY AND THE RESTORATION OF </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT OF SHAYKH JABIR.  HE UNEQUIVOCALLY ADDED </p><p>SAUDI ARABIA\'S NAME TO THIS LIST. </p><p> </p><p>--    FAHD THEN PRAISED EGYPTIAN PRESIDENT MUBARAK\'S CALL </p><p>FOR AN EMERGENCY ARAB SUMMIT, SAYING THAT IT WOULD LEAD </p><p>TO AN INCREASE IN ARAB SOLIDARITY. </p><p> </p><p>--    FINALLY, FAHD TURNED TO THE CRITICAL NEED TO </p><p>PROTECT SAUDI ARABIA, ITS ECONOMY AND ALL THE </p><p>ACHIEVEMENTS THAT IT HAS MADE IN RECENT YEARS.  HE NOTED </p><p>THAT SAUDI ARABIA COULD NOT SUCCESSFULLY UNDERTAKE ITS </p><p>DEFENSE BY ITSELF AND THEREFORE THE SAG HAD CALLED ON </p><p>FRIENDLY COUNTRIES TO ASSIST IT. </p><p> </p><p>--    AT THIS POINT, FAHD THANKED THE "U.S., UK AND OTHER </p><p>FRIENDLY COUNTRIES" WHICH HAD RESPONDED TO THE SAUDI </p><p>REQUEST BY PROVIDING AIR AND GROUND FORCES FOR THE </p><p>DEFENSE OF SAUDI ARABIA AND THE MAINTENANCE OF PEACE AND </p><p>STABILITY FOR ALL THE STATES OF THE ARAB GULF REGION, </p><p>YESTERDAY, TODAY AND TOMORROW -- GOD WILLING.  HOWEVER, </p><p>HE STRESSED THAT SUCH SUPPORT WOULD BE TEMPORARY, AND </p><p>WOULD END IMMEDIATELY--AS SOON AS THE KINGDOM REQUESTED. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT: </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) AS REFTELS POINTED OUT, SAUDI MEDIA COVERAGE OF </p><p>THE CRISIS HAS GRADUALLY BEEN GROWING MORE CANDID AND </p><p>COMPLETE.  NOW THE KING HAS GONE ON RECORD PERSONALLY </p><p>WITH A STATEMENT LAYING OUT CLEARLY WHAT HAPPENED, WHO IS </p><p>RESPONSIBLE (ALTHOUGH HE DIDN\'T MENTION SADDAM BY NAME) </p><p>AND WHAT THE SAUDI POSITION IS.  HE HAS ALSO CAST THE </p><p>IRAQI INVASION AS A CRISIS FOR THE WHOLE WORLD (NOT JUST </p><p>THE ARAB WORLD) AND MADE IT CLEAR TO THE SAUDI PUBLIC </p><p>THAT IT IS A DIRECT THREAT TO SAUDI SECURITY. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) IN DOMESTIC POLITICAL TERMS, THE SPEECH WAS </p><p>IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT PROVIDED A CLEAR, PUBLIC EXPLANATION </p><p>FOR THE INTRODUCTION OF U.S. FORCES.  OUR RAPIDLY GROWING </p><p>MILITARY PRESENCE HERE IS NO SECRET AND FAHD COULD ILL </p><p>AFFORD TO WAIT TOO LONG BEFORE EXPLAINING SUCH A DRASTIC </p><p>STEP TO HIS SUBJECTS.  NOW THAT HE HAS DONE SO AND </p><p>EMPHASIZED THE TEMPORARY NATURE OF OUR SUPPORT, WE </p><p>BELIEVE THAT THE DOMESTIC REACTION WILL BE MANAGEABLE FOR </p><p>SOME TIME.  THIS WILL NOT LAST FOREVER, HOWEVER. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) ALTHOUGH SADDAM\'S KUWAIT BASHING AMUSED MANY </p><p>SAUDIS AT FIRST, FAHD\'S SPEECH RELATING THE INVASION TO </p><p>SAUDI ARABIA\'S OWN SECURITY SHOULD QUICKLY CHANGE PUBLIC </p><p>ATTITUDES.  SADDAM IS HARDLY THE POPULAR FIGURE HERE THAT </p><p>HE SEEMS TO BE IN SOME OTHER ARAB COUNTRIES.  SAUDI </p><p>RELIGIOUS ELITES HAVE NO LOVE FOR SADDAM\'S SECULAR, </p><p>BAATHIST SOCIALIST IDEOLOGY. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) ON THE OTHER HAND, RELIGIOUS CONSERVATIVES ALSO </p><p>FEAR WESTERN CULTURAL INROADS INTO SAUDI ARABIA.  THE </p><p>LONGER LARGE NUMBERS OF WESTERN TROOPS ARE PRESENT IN </p><p>SAUDI ARABIA THE GREATER THOSE FEARS WILL BECOME. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) IMPORTANTLY FOR U.S./SAUDI RELATIONS, FAHD HAS </p><p>PUBLICLY THANKED THE U.S. FOR RESPONDING TO SAUDI </p><p>ARABIA\'S CALL FOR ASSISTANCE IN ITS DEFENSE.  WHILE NO </p><p>ARAB WILL MISS THIS MESSAGE, IT IS ALSO CLEAR THAT FAHD\'S </p><p>STRESS ON THE TEMPORARY NATURE OF THE FOREIGN MILITARY </p><p>PRESENCE HERE, THE DEFENSIVE POSTURE OF THAT PRESENCE, </p><p>AND THE FACT THAT THE FRIENDLY FOREIGN FORCES WILL LEAVE </p><p>IMMEDIATELY AT THE KINGDOM\'S REQUEST WAS MADE TO ALLAY </p><p>CONCERNS BY MANY SAUDIS OVER THE MOTIVES OF THE GROWING </p><p>U.S. BUILD-UP IN THE KINGDOM. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) NONETHELESS, FAHD HAS NOW OPENLY TIED THE U.S. </p><p>AND THE KINGDOM TOGETHER IN THE FACE OF THE IRAQI </p><p>MILITARY THREAT.  SADDAM MAY HAVE REDRAWN THE MAP OF THE </p><p>MIDDLE EAST, BUT HE DID NOT ANTICIPATE ALL THE </p><p>CONSEQUENCES OF HIS ACTIONS.  NOT ALL THE CHANGES ARE </p><p>GOING TO BE TO HIS LIKING BY ANY MEANS. </p><p> </p><p>10.  MINIMIZE CONSIDERED. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FREEMAN </p><p></p></div>
