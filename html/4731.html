"Milliyet" reports that the US </p><p>Administration expects to hear Turkish response to its </p><p>military demands this week.  The deployment of thousands of </p><p>troops in Turkey, and the use of Turkish Air bases and ports </p><p>are among those demands.  "Milliyet" notes that the Turkish </p><p>government will decide on the issue after consulting with </p><p>the parliament, the NSC, and the General Staff.  The </p><p>Military is positive about coordination and cooperation with </p><p>the US, but is against the deployment of US troops on </p><p>Turkish territory.  The US Administration is reportedly </p><p>expected to send a delegation from the Pentagon to Turkey in </p><p>order to examine the military bases for possible upgrades. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EU/Cyprus: Citing the German paper "Welt am Sontag", </p><p>"Hurriyet" reports that in the Copenhagen declaration, a </p><p>sentence was added saying that the entry talks with Turkey </p><p>should begin without delay following the EU criteria review </p><p>in December 2004.  In exchange for this sentence, Turkey had </p><p>to promise to resolve the Cyprus issue by February 28. </p><p>"Radikal" reports Turkish Foreign Minister Yakis\'s comments </p><p>that `a settlement in Cyprus is inevitable.\' Without a </p><p>settlement, Yakis warned, the Greek Cypriots will enter the </p><p>EU on their own, making the Turkish armed forces an </p><p>`occupier\' of EU territory.  The FM added that a settlement </p><p>on the island will be reached with the participation of the </p><p>parliament, the public, NGOs, and the TRNC administration. </p><p>"Cumhuriyet" reports that Erdogan and Gul were rather pushy </p><p>in their lobbying for EU support in Copenhagen.  In the end, </p><p>the EU was tired of the Turkish pressure.  The Turkish </p><p>government was wrong to publish some cheap advertisements in </p><p>the papers, to hide behind US support, and to threaten the </p><p>EU with the proposal to enter NAFTA.  "Cumhuriyet" notes </p><p>that Erdogan\'s unrealistic threats undermined his </p><p>credibility at the summit. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DYP: All papers report that parliamentary deputy Mehmet Agar </p><p>was elected as the new chairman of DYP at a party congress </p><p>on Saturday.  Sunday\'s "Milliyet" reports that Agar has made </p><p>his career in politics despite his controversial role in the </p><p>Susurluk scandal, which uncovered a web of state-mafia </p><p>links. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CIA-Turkish Tarikat connection: "Hurriyet" reports that the </p><p>Russian Secret Service has charged Fethullah Gulen\'s </p><p>Nurcular Tarikat with espionage, and linked the group to the </p><p>CIA through various foundations and private businesses. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>C. EDITORIAL OPINION: US-Turkey </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"A new alliance between US and AKP" </p><p>Washington correspondent of mass appeal "Milliyet" Yasemin </p><p>Congar wrote (12/16): "The way the AKP government tried to </p><p>sell the Copenhagen decision to the Turkish public and the </p><p>fact that it did not hesitate to continue the reforms </p><p>brought optimism to the US administration.  Washington is </p><p>pleased to see that the AKP prefers determination on the EU </p><p>goal as opposed to cheap populism and nationalism. . The </p><p>Bush administration, on the other hand, believes that with </p><p>the Copenhagen decision of December 12, not only the EU but </p><p>also Turkey and the Turkish Cypriots have missed a chance. </p><p>The US was expecting a breakthrough on Cyprus as a result of </p><p>the Annan plan, and had hoped to see an agreement reached by </p><p>December 12. . Now Washington\'s deadline for Cyprus is </p><p>February 28, and it very much believes that a settlement of </p><p>the Cyprus issue will pave the way for important </p><p>opportunities before the AKP government. .  Iraq was another </p><p>key issue during Erdogan\'s meetings in the US. Erdogan has </p><p>made no commitments, but US officials believe that they have </p><p>ensured a `common understanding.\' </p><p>With the help of Erdogan\'s visit, the AKP and the US laid </p><p>the groundwork for a new alliance. Previous Turkish leaders </p><p>had to strive for months and years to establish a warm </p><p>relationship with the US, but Erdogan managed to do this </p><p>even before the expiration of his political ban.  . </p><p>Washington wants to trust Turkey in its efforts to resolve </p><p>the Cyprus issue, and to enlist Turkey\'s cooperation in the </p><p>fight against Saddam Hussein. </p><p>February 28 stands as an important date for a Cyprus </p><p>settlement.  But in fact the strike against Iraq might take </p><p>place before that." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Behind the scenes" </p><p>Washington reporter Asli Aydintasbas wrote in mass appeal </p><p>Sabah (12/16): "It remains to be seen whether Ankara will </p><p>manage to achieve its economic demands from the US now that </p><p>Washington is caught up in a `pre-war\' atmosphere. . Turkey </p><p>has not given a clear response to the US demands for </p><p>military cooperation presented by the Pentagon and Deputy </p><p>Secretary Wolfowitz.  Ankara still waits to what kind of </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>economic assistance package it can get from Washington. . </p><p>Ankara should not make colossal demands to the US, because </p><p>they are simply not realistic.  A realistic portrayal of a </p><p>Turkey compensation plan is required.  Let\'s take Pakistan </p><p>for example.  Pakistan asked the US to see customs tariffs </p><p>lowered and quotas lifted on textiles in exchange of its </p><p>support for the Afghan operation.  It simply did not happen </p><p>the way Pakistan desired.  Turkey is not Pakistan, but there </p><p>are certain things which might not be realistic for Turkey </p><p>either, including the lifting of textile quotas and the </p><p>expansion of the QIZ structure." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
