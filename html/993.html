<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 CARACAS 000745 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  3/04/09 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, ECON, ETRD, VE </p><p>SUBJECT: CHAVEZ AFTER FIVE WEEKS </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR JOHN F. MAISTO.  REASON:  1.5 (D). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) PRESIDENT HUGO CHAVEZ\'S FIRST FIVE WEEKS IN OFFICE HAVE </p><p>BEEN CHARACTERIZED BY DRAMATIC AND CONFRONTATIONAL ADVANCEMENT OF </p><p>HIS AGENDA OF POLITICAL AND INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE, ADMINISTRATIVE </p><p>FUMBLING AS HE ATTEMPTS TO INSTALL HIS GOVERNING TEAM, AND </p><p>CONTINUITY OF ECONOMIC POLICY FROM THE CALDERA ADMINISTRATION. HIS </p><p>IMPATIENCE WITH ESTABLISHED PROCEDURE, PROFOUND SUSPICION OF HIS </p><p>POLITICAL ADVERSARIES, AND NEED TO RESPOND TO HIS POPULAR SUPPORT </p><p>BASE HAVE LED TO ACTION AND RHETORIC WHICH, WHILE WELL WITHIN THE </p><p>BOUNDS OF DEMOCRATIC PRACTICE (EXCEPT FOR  REMARK ABOUT THE SUPREME </p><p>COURT FROM WHICH HE QUICKLY STEPPED BACK), HAVE GIVEN RISE TO </p><p>CHARGES OF AUTHORITARIANISM. HIS ADVERSARIES DEEPLY RESENT HIS </p><p>HECTORING WAYS, BUT HIS POPULARITY CONTINUES TO GROW WITH EACH </p><p>SLASHING ATTACK AGAINST TRADITIONAL POLITICAL PARTIES AND CORRUPT </p><p>PRACTICES.  DURING HIS FIRST FIVE WEEKS, DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS-- </p><p>SUCH AS THE CONGRESS AND THE SUPREME COURT--HAVE LEARNED TO PUSH </p><p>BACK WHEN SHOVED, AND A RECOGNIZABLE OPPOSITION IS SLOWLY FORMING </p><p>IN THE CONGRESS.  IN THE MEANTIME, CHAVEZ\'S GREATEST THREAT COMES </p><p>NOT FROM HIS POLITICAL ENEMIES, BUT FROM AN ECONOMY WHICH CANNOT </p><p>PAY THE GOVERNMENT\'S BILLS, GENERATE EMPLOYMENT, OR PROVIDE THE </p><p>ADDITIONAL REVENUE NECESSARY TO ADDRESS PRESSING SOCIAL NEEDS.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>THE FIRST FIVE WEEKS </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) LIKE PECOS BILL RIDING THE TORNADO, PRESIDENT HUGO CHAVEZ </p><p>HAS STRAPPED HIMSELF TO THE BACK OF VENEZUELAN DEMOCRACY AND VOWED </p><p>TO RIDE IT TOWARDS PROFOUND POLITICAL AND INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE. </p><p>UNDAUNTED BY ESTABLISHED PROCEDURES OR THE NICETIES OF </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY DISCOURSE, THE AT TIMES RHETORICALLY AGGRESSIVE </p><p>CHAVEZ HAS CHALLENGED VENEZUELA\'S POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS AND ACTORS </p><p>TO RESPOND TO THE RESULTS OF THE DECEMBER 6 ELECTION AND TO MAKE </p><p>VENEZUELAN DEMOCRACY RELEVANT TO THE EVERY DAY CONCERNS OF THE </p><p>VENEZUELAN PEOPLE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  IN SHORT ORDER, CHAVEZ HAS: </p><p> </p><p>--  ISSUED A DECREE CALLING FOR A REFERENDUM ON HIS PROPOSED </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY; </p><p> </p><p>--  ORDERED THE NATIONAL ELECTORAL COUNCIL TO BEGIN PREPARATIONS </p><p>FOR THE REFERENDUM; </p><p> </p><p>--  ESTABLISHED A PRESIDENTIAL COMMISSION TO LAY THE GROUNDWORK FOR </p><p>SUCH AN ASSEMBLY; </p><p> </p><p>--  BEGUN A SERIES OF CONSULTATIONS WITH KEY SOCIAL AND POLITICAL </p><p>SECTORS REGARDING THE AGENDA OF THE ASSEMBLY; </p><p> </p><p>--  SUBMITTED AN ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ENABLING LAW TO THE </p><p>CONGRESS, WHICH, IF APPROVED, WOULD GIVE HIM BROAD POWERS TO </p><p>ADDRESS VENEZUELA\'S FISCAL CRISIS; </p><p> </p><p>--  JUMP-STARTED HIS SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM </p><p>THROUGH HIS "PLAN BOLIVAR 2000," A MILITARY-RUN CIVIC ACTION </p><p>PROGRAM (INCLUDING SUCH WARMLY-RECEIVED WORK IN THE POOREST SECTORS </p><p>OF CARACAS AS PICKING UP TRASH, PAINTING SCHOOLS, AND STAFFING </p><p>CLINICS WITH MILITARY DOCTORS). </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) CHAVEZ HAS PUSHED HIS AGENDA IN A PUGNACIOUS AND </p><p>CONFRONTATIONAL FASHION.  HE HAS LEAP-FROGGED THE CONGRESS ON THE </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY REFERENDUM, THREATENED THE SUPREME COURT </p><p>WITH POPULAR WRATH THAT HE WOULD CHAMPION SHOULD IT BLOCK HIS PLANS </p><p>FOR A REFERENDUM, AND CHARACTERIZED VENEZUELA\'S TRADITIONAL </p><p>POLITICAL PARTIES AND INSTITUTIONS AS CORRUPT AND INEFFECTIVE. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) HIS HARD-HITTING AND POPULIST RHETORIC, WHILE WITHIN THE </p><p>BOUNDS OF DEMOCRATIC TRADITION AND PRACTICE, HAS PROVOKED THE </p><p>RESENTMENT AND HOSTILITY OF HIS ADVERSARIES.  THEIR INITIAL EFFORTS </p><p>TO BLOCK OR RE-ROUTE CHAVEZ\'S CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY INITIATIVE </p><p>WERE STEAM-ROLLERED BY CHAVEZ, WHO REFUSED TO ALLOW THEIR </p><p>INSTITUTIONAL POSITION TO DILUTE OR DIMINISH WHAT CHAVEZ BELIEVES </p><p>IS HIS ELECTORAL MANDATE TO EFFECT SWEEPING POLITICAL CHANGES. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) CHAVEZ\'S SUCCESS IN DRIVING HIS POLITICAL AGENDA FORWARD </p><p>HAS HAD ONE IMPORTANT CONSEQUENCE:  MOVEMENT TOWARDS A </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY IS A REALITY.  THE QUESTION NOW IS NOT </p><p>WHETHER SUCH AN ASSEMBLY WILL HAPPEN, BUT HOW AND UNDER WHAT </p><p>CONDITIONS.  THE RECOGNITION OF THIS HAS FORCED MOST IMPORTANT </p><p>POLITICAL ACTORS TO ACCEPT THE NECESSITY OF CHANGE, AND TO LOOK FOR </p><p>A WAY TO LINK THEMSELVES TO THE REFORM PROCESS.  AT THE SAME TIME, </p><p>CHAVEZ\'S CONFRONTATIONAL TACTICS HAVE ACTIVATED NATURAL DEMOCRATIC </p><p>DEFENSE MECHANISMS.  INSTITUTIONS, SUCH AS THE CONGRESS AND THE </p><p>SUPREME COURT, ARE LEARNING HOW TO PUSH BACK WHEN SHOVED.  FOR </p><p>INSTANCE, WHEN CHAVEZ "THREATENED" THE SUPREME COURT ON ITS PENDING </p><p>REFERENDUM DECISION, CHIEF JUSTICE CECILIA SOSA PUBLICLY LECTURED </p><p>CHAVEZ ON THE SEPARATION OF POWERS AND MADE IT VERY CLEAR THAT THE </p><p>COURT WOULD NOT BE INTIMIDATED.  THAT MEETING WAS FOLLOWED BY A </p><p>CHAVEZ VISIT TO THE SUPREME COURT, AFTER WHICH HE STATED THAT HE </p><p>WOULD, OF COURSE, ACCEPT WHATEVER DECISION THE COURT MADE.  THE </p><p>RESULT HAS BEEN A CLEARER DEFINITION OF THE INFLUENCE AND AUTHORITY </p><p>OF THESE INSTITUTIONS.  ALSO, OPPOSITION TO THE GOVERNMENT IS </p><p>FORMING IN THE CONGRESS AND ELSEWHERE.  THIS OPPOSITION, </p><p>RECOGNIZING THE NECESSITY OF CHANGE, IS WORKING TO INFLUENCE THAT </p><p>CHANGE, AND ENSURE THAT IT TAKES PLACE WITHIN A DEMOCRATIC AND </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>ADMINISTRATIVE FUMBLING </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) CHAVEZ\'S SUCCESS IN DRIVING FORWARD HIS POLITICAL AGENDA </p><p>HAS NOT BEEN MATCHED IN THE FORMATION OF HIS GOVERNMENT.  SLOW </p><p>MINISTERIAL APPOINTMENTS, EVEN SLOWER SELECTION OF KEY DIRECTOR- </p><p>LEVEL POSITIONS WITHIN MINISTRIES, AND THE PRESIDENT\'S TENDENCY TO </p><p>TALK TOO MUCH AND MAKE POLICY DURING PRESS CONFERENCES HAVE GIVEN </p><p>THE FIRST MONTH OF GOVERNMENT AN AD HOC, IMPULSIVE QUALITY. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) LACKING A TESTED, LOYAL PARTY CADRE, AND FACED WITH AN </p><p>ANXIOUS AND SOMETIMES INSOLENT GOVERNMENT BUREAUCRACY, CHAVEZ HAS </p><p>HAD TO LOOK FOR NEW WAYS TO TAKE CONTROL OF THE MACHINERY OF </p><p>GOVERNMENT.  ONE WAY HAS BEEN TO NAME FORMER MILITARY OFFICERS TO </p><p>KEY POSITIONS WITHIN THE BUREAUCRACY.  HIS ADVERSARIES ACCUSE HIM </p><p>OF "MILITARIZING" GOVERNMENT.  ANOTHER INTERPRETATION WOULD BE THAT </p><p>HE IS USING PEOPLE HE KNOWS AND TRUSTS TO GAIN CONTROL AND SET </p><p>DIRECTION.  IN SOME INSTANCES THIS STRATEGY HAS WORKED, IN OTHERS </p><p>IT HAS NOT.  WHILE TRUSTWORTHY, MANY OF THE MILITARY APPOINTEES </p><p>HAVE NO EXPERIENCE IN CIVILIAN MINISTRIES, HAVE LITTLE POLICY </p><p>ORIENTATION, AND EVEN LESS UNDERSTANDING OF THE POLITICAL NATURE OF </p><p>THEIR WORK.  THE RESULT HAS BEEN UNEVEN PERFORMANCE IN MANY </p><p>MINISTRIES. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT CHAVEZ IS IN THE PROCESS OF </p><p>SHRINKING THE NUMBER OF MINISTRIES FROM 26 TO APPROXIMATELY 15, AND </p><p>HAS DECIDED TO HOLD ALL MINISTRIES AND MINISTERS TO ACCOUNT.  THIS </p><p>HAS NOT BEEN DONE IN THE PAST.  (HE ALSO HAS TO TACKLE THE PROMISED </p><p>REDUCTION OF THE NUMBER OF GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES, WHICH HE IS </p><p>AVOIDING FOR THE TIME BEING.)  IN THIS REGARD, CHAVEZ HAS INVITED </p><p>SCRUTINY WHICH, WHILE IMPORTANT TO THE PROCESS OF CHANGE, WILL BE </p><p>PAINFUL FOR A NEW GOVERNMENT TRYING TO GET STARTED.  IN SHORT, IT </p><p>WILL TAKE A WHILE FOR THE NEW GOVERNMENT TO SETTLE IN. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>CONTINUITY OF ECONOMIC POLICY </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C)  CHAVEZ\'S CAMPAIGN RHETORIC HAD CREATED CONCERN WITHIN THE </p><p>PRIVATE SECTOR THAT THE NEWLY-ELECTED PRESIDENT WOULD IMPLEMENT </p><p>POPULIST ECONOMIC POLICY, DEEPENING VENEZUELA\'S ALREADY SERIOUS </p><p>ECONOMIC PROBLEMS.  DURING HIS FIRST FIVE WEEKS IN OFFICE, HOWEVER, </p><p>CHAVEZ HAS STEERED CLEAR OF SUCH POLICY, DECIDING INSTEAD TO </p><p>MAINTAIN THE REFORM-MINDED ECONOMIC POLICY OF HIS PREDECESSOR. </p><p>SPECIFICALLY, CHAVEZ HAS: </p><p> </p><p>--  NAMED MARITZA IZAGUIRRE AS FINANCE MINISTER (SHE WAS CALDERA\'S </p><p>FINANCE MINISTER AND THE GOV\'S LINK TO THE MULTILATERAL BANKS); </p><p> </p><p>--  REQUESTED, IN THE ENABLING LAW HE SUBMITTED TO CONGRESS, </p><p>EMERGENCY POWERS TO REINFORCE IZAGUIRRE\'S APPROACH TO VENEZUELA\'S </p><p>FISCAL CRISIS THROUGH COST CUTTING AND REVENUE RAISING MEASURES; </p><p> </p><p>--  LEFT ANTONIO CASAS AS DIRECTOR OF THE CENTRAL BANK </p><p> </p><p>--  MAINTAINED CASAS\' SCORCHED-EARTH DEFENSE OF THE STRONG BOLIVAR; </p><p> </p><p>--  BEGUN TALKS WITH THE IMF. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) CHAVEZ, COGNIZANT THAT HE DOES NOT HAVE THE ECONOMIC </p><p>WHEREWITHAL TO MEET VENEZUELA\'S PRESSING SOCIAL NEEDS, IS </p><p>ATTEMPTING TO ENHANCE GOVERNMENT REVENUES.  AGAIN, HE HAS FORSAKEN </p><p>A POPULIST APPROACH.  INSTEAD, HE HAS: </p><p> </p><p>--  REQUESTED AUTHORITY TO IMPOSE NEW TAXES, INCLUDING A VALUE </p><p>ADDED TAX, FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS TAX, AND REFORM OF THE INCOME TAX </p><p>LAW; </p><p> </p><p>--  ORDERED IMPROVED TAX COLLECTION AT SENIAT AND CUSTOMS; </p><p> </p><p>--  LIMITED PUBLIC SECTOR WAGE INCREASES TO TWENTY PERCENT (BELOW </p><p>THE 30 PERCENT INFLATION REGISTERED IN 1998, AND THE GOV\'S LATEST </p><p>PROJECTED INFLATION RATE OF 25 PERCENT IN 1999); </p><p> </p><p>--  AUTHORIZED THE STATE OIL COMPANY PDVSA TO BORROW USD 1 BILLION </p><p>(WHICH MATCHES PDVSA\'S ANTICIPATED ROYALTIES AND TAXES) ON THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL CAPITAL MARKETS; </p><p> </p><p>--  DECIDED TO FINANCE THE BS 800 BILLION DEFICIT FOR THE FIRST </p><p>QUARTER OF 1999 THROUGH REDUCTION IN MONETARY STABILIZATION </p><p>INSTRUMENT (TEMS) ISSUANCES AND AN EVEN GREATER EXPANSION IN </p><p>ISSUANCE OF NATIONAL PUBLIC DEBT BONDS (DPNS). </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>RACE AGAINST TIME </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) CHAVEZ\'S DECISION TO MAINTAIN CONTINUITY OF ECONOMIC </p><p>POLICY IS DRIVEN BY THE PRIMACY OF HIS POLITICAL AGENDA.  CONCERNED </p><p>THAT DRAMATIC ENGAGEMENT WITH THE ECONOMY WOULD EXPOSE HIM TO </p><p>POLITICAL ATTACK, CHAVEZ HAS DECIDED TO PUSH HIS POLITICAL AGENDA </p><p>AS FAR AND AS FAST AS HE CAN BEFORE TURNING TO DEAL WITH THE </p><p>ECONOMY.  CONTINUITY OF ECONOMIC POLICY BUYS HIM SOME POLITICAL </p><p>SPACE, SINCE THE CONSENSUS AROUND THIS POLICY ALREADY EXISTS. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C) HOWEVER, CHAVEZ CAN ONLY CARRY THIS CONTINUITY FORWARD FOR </p><p>SO LONG.  HE KNOWS THAT HIS GOVERNMENT SITS ON A CRUMBLING ECONOMIC </p><p>BASE.  STILL DECLINING OIL PRICES AND SELF-IMPOSED PRODUCTION CUTS </p><p>HAVE AGGRAVATED THE CURRENT RECESSION.  HIGH INTEREST RATES AND THE </p><p>INCREASINGLY OVERVALUED EXCHANGE RATE HAVE UNDERMINED THE HEALTH OF </p><p>THE MANUFACTURING, AGRICULTURAL, AND TOURISM SECTORS.  INFLATION IS </p><p>STILL HIGH. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C) ADDITIONALLY, CHAVEZ STILL HAS TO CONVINCE THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS (IFIS) AND THE FOREIGN BANKS </p><p>THAT HE HAS THE POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC SITUATION IN HAND, AND THE </p><p>POLITICAL WILL TO MAKE TOUGH DECISIONS.  TO DO THIS HE NEEDS AN </p><p>ARRANGEMENT WITH THE IMF AND PERSONAL EXPOSURE IN NEW YORK. </p><p>CHAVEZ\'S TWO POSTPONED VISITS HAVE HURT HIM, AND HE AND HIS TOP </p><p>ADVISORS ARE ONLY NOW UNDERSTANDING HOW MUCH. </p><p> </p><p>15.  (C)  VENEZUELA\'S BATTERED ECONOMIC AGENTS HAVE RESPONDED TO </p><p>THESE WEAK ECONOMIC SIGNALS BY PREPARING FOR EVEN MORE DIFFICULT </p><p>TIMES: </p><p> </p><p>--  INVESTORS CONTINUE TO SIT ON THEIR WALLETS; </p><p> </p><p>--  BANKS ARE PULLING BACK ON LOAN PORTFOLIOS AND INCREASING </p><p>PROVISIONS FOR BAD DEBT; </p><p> </p><p>--  COMPANIES ARE SHUTTING DOWN PLANTS AND ASSEMBLY LINES AND </p><p>LAYING OFF WORKERS TO REDUCE COSTS; </p><p> </p><p>--  WHOLESALERS AND RETAILERS ARE LOWERING PRICES TO CUT </p><p>INVENTORIES; </p><p> </p><p>--  CONSUMERS ARE FORGOING LUXURY ITEMS, POSTPONING LARGE </p><p>PURCHASES, AND PAYING OFF CONSUMER DEBT. </p><p> </p><p>16.  (C)  AS CHAVEZ ENTERS HIS SECOND MONTH OF GOVERNMENT, THE BIG </p><p>QUESTION IS HOW LONG HE CAN POSTPONE MAJOR ECONOMIC REFORMS WHILE </p><p>HE FULFILLS HIS POLITICAL AGENDA.  THE REFERENDUM FOR THE HOLDING </p><p>OF A CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY IS SCHEDULED FOR APRIL 25.  THE ELECTION </p><p>OF THE ASSEMBLY, THE WRITING OF A NEW CONSTITUTION, A REFERENDUM TO </p><p>ACCEPT THE NEW CONSTITUTION AND THE ELECTION OF A NEW CONGRESS WILL </p><p>PROBABLY RUN THROUGH THE END OF THE YEAR. </p><p> </p><p>17.  (C)  CHAVEZ\'S EFFORTS TO MAINTAIN CONTINUITY OF ECONOMIC </p><p>POLICY MAY NOT LAST THAT LONG.  THE GOV HAS ENOUGH INTERNAL DOLLAR </p><p>RESOURCES (THE REMAINING USD 680 MILLION IN TREASURY BONDS RELEASED </p><p>FROM THE 1997 GLOBAL BOND SWAP AND USD 160 MILLION IN NON- </p><p>MONETARIZED GOLD) TO MEET VENEZUELA\'S FOREIGN DEBT PAYMENTS THROUGH </p><p>THE END OF MARCH.  AFTER THAT IT WILL HAVE TO RELY ON STATE OIL </p><p>COMPANY PDVSA\'S EFFORTS TO RAISE FUNDS IN THE INTERNATIONAL CAPITAL </p><p>MARKETS AND THE CENTRAL BANK OF VENEZUELA\'S DECLINING INTERNATIONAL </p><p>RESERVES TO FINANCE FUTURE DEBT PAYMENTS.  THE PDVSA BORROWING WILL </p><p>BE COSTLY (300 TO 400 BASIS POINTS OVER TREASURY RATES) BECAUSE THE </p><p>MARKETS KNOW THAT THESE FUNDS WILL END UP IN THE GOV\'S ACCOUNTS. </p><p>THE GOV WILL ALSO HAVE TO RELY ON THE ISSUANCE OF ADDITIONAL DPNS </p><p>TO MEET THE GOVERNMENT PAYROLL.  THIS QUIET SCRAMBLE FOR FOREIGN </p><p>AND DOMESTIC RESOURCES SHOULD PAY THE GOV\'S BILLS THROUGH THE END </p><p>OF THE SECOND QUARTER. </p><p> </p><p>18.  (C)  AFTER THAT, IT IS TOO DIFFICULT TO PREDICT.  OIL PRICES </p><p>MAY RECOVER, BUDGET CUTS AND REVENUE MEASURES MAY BEGIN TO TAKE </p><p>EFFECT, AND THE GOV MAY BE ABLE TO MAKE IT TO THE END OF THE YEAR. </p><p>ALTERNATIVELY, THE MARKET COULD LOOSE CONFIDENCE IN THE GOV\'S </p><p>ABILITY TO FINANCE ITS DEFICIT, PROVOKING A RUN ON THE BOLIVAR AND </p><p>A SUDDEN LOSS OF RESERVES.  THIS COULD FORCE THE GOV TO IMPLEMENT </p><p>PRICE AND EXCHANGE CONTROLS OR A MAXI-DEVALUATION.  THE RESULTING </p><p>SURGE IN INFLATION COULD THEN UNDERMINE CHAVEZ\' POLITICAL SUPPORT </p><p>AND INVIGORATE HIS POLITICAL OPPOSITION IN THE MIDST OF THE </p><p>POLITICAL REFORM PROCESS. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>WHAT IT ALL MEANS </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>19.  (C) CHAVEZ WAS ELECTED TO BRING ABOUT SIGNIFICANT POLITICAL </p><p>CHANGE IN VENEZUELA.  IT IS UP TO HIS GOVERNMENT, THROUGH </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGE, IMPROVED GOVERNMENT, AND ECONOMIC REFORM, TO </p><p>MAKE DEMOCRACY AND ITS INSTITUTIONS MEANINGFUL TO THE EVERYDAY </p><p>CONCERNS OF VENEZUELANS.  HE UNDERSTANDS THAT HE IS THE </p><p>CONSEQUENCE, AND NOT THE CAUSE, OF CHANGE IN VENEZUELA. </p><p> </p><p>20.  (C) HE ALSO UNDERSTANDS THAT HIS POLITICAL AGENDA IS MOVING </p><p>THROUGH A NARROWING ECONOMIC SPACE.  HE MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO </p><p>COMPLETE HIS IMMEDIATE POLITICAL AGENDA BEFORE HE IS CAUGHT IN AN </p><p>ECONOMY IN DEEP CRISIS.  HOWEVER, HE INTENDS TO GET AS FAR ALONG </p><p>THE PATH OF POLITICAL CHANGE AS POSSIBLE.  AT THE LEAST, HE HOPES </p><p>TO HAVE A CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY IN PLACE THAT SUPPORTS HIS </p><p>POLITICAL AGENDA. </p><p> </p><p>21.  (C) CHAVEZ\'S FIRST FIVE WEEKS IN OFFICE HAVE BEEN DRAMATIC AND </p><p>HIGHLY-CHARGED.  NO VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT HAS BROUGHT SUCH </p><p>EXPECTATION TO OFFICE.  NO VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT HAS SET SUCH A HIGH </p><p>STANDARD FOR HIMSELF AND HIS ADMINISTRATION.  NO VENEZUELAN </p><p>PRESIDENT HAS EVER ANTICIPATED SUCH DIRE RESULTS SHOULD HE FAIL. </p><p>GIVEN THIS, CHAVEZ\'S IS OFF TO A DECENT START.  HOWEVER, TO </p><p>SUCCEED, CHAVEZ MUST USE THE NEXT MONTHS TO MAINTAIN THE MOMENTUM </p><p>OF HIS POLITICAL AGENDA, IMPROVE HIS ADMINISTRATION, AND HOPE THE </p><p>ECONOMY CONTINUES TO HOLD TOGETHER AS HIS INHERITED REFORMIST </p><p>ECONOMIC POLICY, WITH HELP FROM THE IFIS AND FOREIGN BANKS, FALLS </p><p>INTO PLACE.  THIS IS A TALL ORDER, BUT ONE THAT HE APPEARS TO BE </p><p>DOGGEDLY COMMITTED TO CARRY THROUGH. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MAISTO </p><p></p></div>
