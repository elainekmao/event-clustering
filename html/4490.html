Sunday\'s "Milliyet" reports that President Sezer was </p><p>disturbed by the headscarf of Parliament Speaker Bulent </p><p>Arinc\'s wife during protocol ceremonies at Esenboga Airport. </p><p>Arinc and his wife had gone to see Sezer off to and welcome </p><p>him back from Prague.  Today\'s papers draw attention to </p><p>Sezer\'s harsh warnings on the headscarf issue.  In a meeting </p><p>with a group of teachers in the presidential palace on </p><p>Sunday, Sezer said that the headscarf cannot be used in </p><p>public places, that it had been banned in the past, and that </p><p>a new debate on the issue will only trigger unnecessary </p><p>controversy and tension. "Cumhuriyet" notes that Sezer </p><p>emphasized the importance of respect for secular principles. </p><p>However, today\'s "Zaman" draws attention to the words of </p><p>Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Ali Sahin, who said that the </p><p>government would resolve the headscarf issue in universities </p><p>by carrying out certain constitutional amendments. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Cyprus: Today\'s "Radikal" reports FM Yakis\' visit to TRNC </p><p>president Denktas in New York, during which Yakis reportedly </p><p>urged Denktas to accept the UN plan as a basis for talks on </p><p>Cyprus.  "Radikal" notes that this is the first pressure </p><p>exerted on Denktas by Turkey.  "Milliyet" reports that </p><p>Turkey is pressuring Denktas to begin discussions. </p><p>"Cumhuriyet" draws attention to the remarks of Mumtaz </p><p>Soysal, a Denktas advisor, that the Turkish side would not </p><p>reject the UN Cyprus plan but use it as a reference point in </p><p>direct peace talks.  Soysal also draws attention to seven </p><p>drawbacks of the plan, which are: 1. The new state is </p><p>founded through constitutional changes, but the Turkish side </p><p>wants to make an interstate agreement; 2. The Turkish side </p><p>says that to protect the Turkish Cypriots, the TRNC must be </p><p>recognized shortly before the signing of an agreement; 3. </p><p>Security guarantees in the UN document are worse than the </p><p>ones in 1960; 4. Greek Cypriots who migrate to the Turkish </p><p>side will damage political equality; 5. Territorial </p><p>regulations in the Annan plan are unfair; 6. Demands for </p><p>exchange of property will create tensions; 7. The maps will </p><p>create huge security problems. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Iraq: Today\'s "Radikal," citing US News and World Report, </p><p>describes a Bush Administration plan for a three-stage </p><p>administration in a post-Saddam Iraq.  In the first stage, </p><p>Iraq will be administered by a US general for 6-12 months. </p><p>In the second stage, the authority of Iraqi officials\' will </p><p>increase and the number of the US soldiers will be reduced. </p><p>This phase will begin after two years.  In the third phase, </p><p>the administration will be passed to a government that will </p><p>represent all segments of the Iraqi population. </p><p>"Cumhuriyet," citing the London-based Essark-ul Avsat </p><p>newspaper, reports that the US is establishing a `Volunteer </p><p>Army\' against Saddam in Northern Iraq.  According to Essark- </p><p>Ul Avsat, the US has begun training 5,000 volunteers in </p><p>Northern Iraq.  In exchange, the volunteers are being </p><p>promised 5,000 dollars in cash and a round-trip ticket to </p><p>the US. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EU: "Turkiye" reports that AKP leader Erdogan will begin a </p><p>new EU tour today.  Starting from Portugal, Erdogan will </p><p>visit Finland, Sweden, France, Luxembourg and the </p><p>Netherlands.  Meanwhile, representatives of non-governmental </p><p>organizations are also making preparations for an EU blitz. </p><p>More than 200 businessmen will go to Brussels for a meeting </p><p>of the "Turkish Platform," a consortium of NGOs. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION: </p><p>Turkey/Cyprus-EU-ESDI </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Erdogan and foreign policy" </p><p>Mehmet Ocaktan notes the change of foreign policy rhetoric </p><p>with the new leadership in Islamic-intellectual Yeni Safak </p><p>(11/25): "AKP leader Tayyip Erdogan has brought about a </p><p>revolutionary change on foreign policy issues.  On the </p><p>Cyprus issue, for instance, we have seen only unrealistic </p><p>approaches from Turkish politicians until Erdogan dared to </p><p>express the rather revolutionary suggestion that EU </p><p>membership, ESDI and Cyprus be considered as a package. </p><p>Erdogan emphasizes the fact that no much we may oppose this </p><p>kind of approach, the EU countries are drawing a direct link </p><p>between Cyprus and Turkey\'s EU membership.  Turkey should </p><p>stop acting like an ostrich, Erdogan says, and pull its head </p><p>out of the sand.  This new approach amounts to a deep </p><p>philosophical change in Turkish foreign policy, which has </p><p>been built under conflict and mistrust.  . And it demands a </p><p>test of sincerity test both for Brussels and for certain </p><p>power centers in Ankara." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Listen to the Cypriots" </p><p>Erdal Guven noted in liberal-intellectual Radikal (11/24): </p><p>"Denktas is certainly a part of the settlement process, but </p><p>it would be wrong to reduce the entire Cyprus issue to the </p><p>views of Denktas.  State policy so far has caused the Cyprus </p><p>issue to become Turkey\'s number one problem because the </p><p>policy envisioned a Denktas-MFA-Military triangle.  However, </p><p>northern Cyprus has opposition parties, NGOs and unions, as </p><p>well as media.  It would be very wrong to ignore what these </p><p>groups have to say, as previous Turkish governments have </p><p>done.  These groups are trying to express their support for </p><p>a settlement and are asking that this historic opportunity </p><p>not be missed." </p><p></p></div>
