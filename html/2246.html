<p>UNCLAS ABUJA 003022 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>TREASURY FOR SONAL SHAW AND MATT TURNER </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: GON SEEKS MEETING WITH PARIS CLUB </p><p>CREDITORS </p><p> </p><p>1. This cable contains an action request in para 4. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. EconOff spoke November 28 with Debt Management Office </p><p>(DMO) Director-General Akin S. Arikawe.  Arikawe expressed </p><p>concern over FY2002 Paris Club payments.  Specifically, he </p><p>said the FY2002 proposed budget allocates N187 billion (USD </p><p>1.55 billion at a rate of N120:USD1) for external debt </p><p>servicing, down from USD 2 billion in FY2001 due to lower oil </p><p>prices and a smaller OPEC quota.  Of the USD 1.55 billion, </p><p>the DMO estimates the GON will pay USD 834 million to </p><p>non-Paris Club creditors, including multilateral institutions </p><p>and the London Club.  FY2002 Paris Club payments would, </p><p>therefore, equal roughly USD 720 million, representing less </p><p>than one-third of payments due for the year.  According to </p><p>DMO calculations, the GON will owe a total of USD 2.268 </p><p>billion to the Paris Club in FY2002.  This figure includes </p><p>overdue arrears from 2001. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  Arikawe said the GON wants to meet soon with the Paris </p><p>Club to discuss GON concerns and receive feedback from the </p><p>creditors.  Arikawe has sent the same request through both </p><p>the IMF and World Bank to Paris Club countries. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. Action Request: Post suggests that Washington consider the </p><p>merits of such a meeting and inform Post soonest. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
