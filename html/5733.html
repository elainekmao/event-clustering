NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR T. PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/01/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, ASEC, ZI, MDC, ZANU-PF </p><p>SUBJECT: GOVERNMENT INTENSIFIES ANTI-MDC VIOLENCE AND </p><p>INTIMIDATION </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. HARARE 214 </p><p>     B. HARARE 159 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Officer Audu Besmer for reasons 1.5 b/d </p><p> </p><p>Summary: </p><p>-------- </p><p>1. (C) In the past three weeks police have arrested and </p><p>detained four MDC MPs, arrested 28 other MDC officials, </p><p>beaten three, tortured at least one and denied permission, </p><p>and / or halted at least four planned gatherings.  As the </p><p>opposition attempts to organize for upcoming parliamentary </p><p>by-elections, and to galvanize public frustration with the </p><p>GOZ, the Mugabe regime has stepped-up its intimidation of </p><p>opposition supporters.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>MPs Arrested, Detained </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>2. (U) The outspoken MDC MP for Harare North, Trudy </p><p>Stevenson, was arrested and detained along with other MDC </p><p>activists on February 10, for several hours.  The group was </p><p>arrested while attempting to submit a petition to the </p><p>Namibian High Commission protesting the Namibian team\'s </p><p>participation in a World Cup Cricket match in Zimbabwe. </p><p>Stevenson and the group were released later that day without </p><p>charge.  One police officer did threaten to charge Stevenson </p><p>with murder, accusing her of murdering the Zimbabwean people </p><p>by attempting to keep away tourists and cricketers. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) On February 8, Gabriel Chaibva, MDC MP for Harare </p><p>South and Shadow Minister for Local Government, seven other </p><p>MDC officials, and several MDC supporters were arrested in </p><p>Hwange while attending a local government strategy workshop </p><p>with local councilors.  The workshop was apparently intended </p><p>to strengthen the capacity of MDC councilors to deliver </p><p>services to their constituents.  The group included Ian </p><p>Makone, a member of the MDC negotiating team to the aborted </p><p>MDC-ZANU PF talks, and Alphinah Ndlovu, MDC Provincial </p><p>chairperson for Matabeleland North.  The group was detained </p><p>for several hours at Hwange Police Station before being </p><p>released without charge. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) On February 8, MDC MP for Harare East, and Secretary </p><p>for Economic Affairs, Tendai Biti, and MDC MP for Glen View </p><p>(Harare) Paul Madzore and 16 other party supporters were </p><p>arrested as they prepared to hold a rally in Mabvuku (about </p><p>15 kms east of Harare).  The group of 18 was held in a small </p><p>lice-infested cell in which other detainees defecated on the </p><p>floor.  The group was released on February 10 after their </p><p>lawyers argued, and the AG\'s office conceded, that there was </p><p>nothing for which to charge them.  Biti and Madzore had not </p><p>notified police of the planned rally, as required by the </p><p>draconian Public Order and Security Act (POSA). </p><p> </p><p>Activists Beaten, Tortured </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>5. (U) On February 3, riot police arrested, detained, denied </p><p>food and beat severely for three days MDC activist Emmanuel </p><p>Toperesu at the Harare Central Police Station.  Police </p><p>accused Toperesu of distributing money to MDC youths who </p><p>would protest the opening of the Tsvangirai trial.  Police </p><p>also demanded a list of MDC supporters attending the trial, </p><p>and plans for other protests with MDC MP Job Sikhala and the </p><p>National Constitutional Assembly.  Police released Toperesu </p><p>after he signed an admission of guilt statement and paid a </p><p>fine of US$2.00 (Z$3,000).  When he was arrested Toperesu was </p><p>still recovering from having been severely beaten in police </p><p>custody in November 2002 (see paragraph 6). </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) Edison Mukwasi, an MDC activist and former MDC youth </p><p>chair for Harare died on February 2 of punctured lung and </p><p>liver injuries sustained during two encounters with police </p><p>torture in January 2001 and November 2002.  In January 2001, </p><p>police arrested Mukwasi in Bikita West with 12 other MDC </p><p>members, tortured them for four days, and dumped them </p><p>overnight in the Gonarezhou National Park--full of wild </p><p>game--in southeastern Zimbabwe.  In November 2002 police </p><p>arrested, beat severely, and released without charge Mukwasi, </p><p>Toperesu (see paragraph 5) and other MDC activists for </p><p>distributing, at a cricket match, documentation of GOZ </p><p>brutalities. </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) On January 24, Police arrested, detained and tortured, </p><p>MDC chairperson for Ward 44 Resias Masunda at the Goromonzi </p><p>Police Station.  During the assault police demanded </p><p>information on the January 13 burning of a commuter bus owned </p><p>by a parastatal, the names of people who attacked the house </p><p>of a ZANU-PF activist in March 2002, and details of the MDC </p><p>campaign strategy for the Kuwadzana by-election scheduled for </p><p>March 29-30.  Police attached electrodes and wet cloths to </p><p>Masunda\'s mouth and genitals while subjecting him to electric </p><p>shocks.  Police released Masunda on January 29 without charge. </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) On January 21, police arrested, detained and severely </p><p>beat MDC Organizing Secretary for Kuwadzana district Derek </p><p>Madharani at the Goromonzi Police Station.  During the </p><p>assault, police demanded to know who petrol-bombed the </p><p>ZANU-PF offices at the Kuwadzana 5 Shopping Center on January </p><p>20 (see paragraph 10) where several MDC members had recently </p><p>been beaten, and what the MDC,s campaign strategy was for </p><p>the Kuwadzana by-election.  Madharani suffered a punctured </p><p>eardrum before being released without charge on January 24. </p><p> </p><p>Councilor Arrested, Detained </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>9. (U) On January 29 Police arrested and detained overnight </p><p>MDC Harare City Councilor Michael Laban as he tried to </p><p>convince police officers to admit Harare residents to Town </p><p>House for a meeting with MDC Mayor Elias Mudzuri, (Ref A). </p><p>After spending a night in a lice-infested, overcrowded Harare </p><p>Central Police station cell, Laban was charged under POSA and </p><p>released on bail of US$1.30 (Z$2,000). </p><p> </p><p>ZANU-PF Offices Petrol-Bombed </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>10. (U) On January 20, suspected MDC youths petrol-bombed </p><p>ZANU-PF offices in the Kuwadzana 5 Shopping Center in </p><p>Kuwadzana.  The MDC had criticized the ruling party for using </p><p>the offices as a base for its youth militia, who have </p><p>conducted violent interrogations and beatings of opposition </p><p>supporters.  Police arrested and beat, some severely, several </p><p>opposition supporters in connection with the bombing, (see </p><p>paragraph 8) however no one has been charged. </p><p> </p><p>Rallies Halted </p><p>-------------- </p><p>11. (SBU) On February 12 police in Bulawayo denied the </p><p>organization Women of Zimbabwe Arise (WOZA) permission to </p><p>hold a Valentine\'s Day "Walk for Love" from the City Hall to </p><p>the High Court in Bulawayo.  Although police have threatened </p><p>to arrest her, activist and WOZA head Sheba Dube, said they </p><p>have publicized the walk widely in the independent press and </p><p>plan to hold it regardless. </p><p> </p><p>12. (SBU) On February 7 High Court judge Susan Mavangira </p><p>upheld police denial of a request by MDC MPs Job Sikhala and </p><p>Ben Tumbare-Mutasa to hold a political rally at the Chibuku </p><p>Stadium in Chitungwiza.  According to Sikhala the rally was </p><p>intended to help publicize his recent torture, and strengthen </p><p>opposition support in the two constituencies.  The MP\'s </p><p>lawyer argued in court that POSA requires event organizers to </p><p>notify police, but has no provision for police to grant or </p><p>deny permission. </p><p> </p><p>13. (U) During January and February police have, on at least </p><p>two other occasions, stopped meetings between MDC politicians </p><p>and their constituents already in progress, (Ref A, B), in </p><p>one event which turned violent at Harare\'s Town House, police </p><p>permission had been "granted" in advance. </p><p> </p><p>Judge Decries Violence </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>14. (U) In his remarks at the opening of the High Court in </p><p>Masvingo on February 13 Justice Moses Chinhengo criticized </p><p>police for harassing, detaining, beating and torturing </p><p>suspects without any evidence of crimes having been </p><p>committed.  Chinhengo said that police brutalization of </p><p>suspects was bringing the whole justice system into disrepute. </p><p> </p><p>Comment: </p><p>-------- </p><p>15. (C) Committed to regaining a two-thirds parliamentary </p><p>majority, the GOZ appears worried that the upcoming </p><p>by-elections in Kuwadzana and Highfield are not a sure bet, </p><p>and is relying on its tried-and-true tactics of intimidation. </p><p> Zimbabweans naturally blame the GOZ for the country\'s </p><p>economic woes.  But caged in by increasing public discontent, </p><p>a plummeting economy and a determination to survive, the GOZ </p><p>has stepped-up (again) its violent campaign of intimidation </p><p>in order to thwart opposition planning and influence.  End </p><p>Comment. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
