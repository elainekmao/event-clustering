<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 002739 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/23/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, SOCI, KDEM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA:  INEC CLOSES REGISTRATION; MANY UNABLE TO </p><p>VOTE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ABUJA 2675 </p><p>     B. ABUJA 2720 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by DCM Timothy D. Andrews.  Reasons 1.5 (B & D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY: INEC wrapped up the ten-day (plus one) </p><p>voter registration period without resolving the most </p><p>important complaint against the exercise: an inadequate </p><p>supply of registration materials resulting in the </p><p>disenfranchisement of roughly half of Nigeria\'s eligible </p><p>voters.  On September 21, the last day of registration, </p><p>EmbOffs traveled outside Abuja to witness firsthand the </p><p>paucity of materials and the swarms of frustrated </p><p>potential-voters and registration officials in Kaduna, </p><p>Nassarawa and Niger States.  There was no evidence of a </p><p>regional, religious or geographic bias in the misconduct of </p><p>the exercise -- incompetence seems to have been the key. </p><p>INEC must now respond to widespread complaints that </p><p>registration was fundamentally incomplete and to calls for </p><p>an extension of the process. Whether this registration will </p><p>produce a credible voters\' list accepted by the general </p><p>public will depend on the extent that INEC heeds these </p><p>complaints.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Extending the ten-day exercise by one day, the </p><p>Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) closed </p><p>voter registration on Sunday, September 22. Receiving a </p><p>rush shipment of registration forms from its South African </p><p>supplier, INEC attempted to distribute the forms throughout </p><p>the country in the last hours of the registration period, </p><p>using Presidential and military air assets, among others. </p><p>Days before, INEC Chairman Dr. Abel Guobadia had stated </p><p>emphatically that registration would not be extended. </p><p>However, on Septmber 21, INEC Secretary Dr. Hakeem Baba- </p><p>Ahmed announced the one-day extension to allow the newly </p><p>arrived 2 million registration forms to be used.  The </p><p>extension was effective in some areas, but not in others. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) EmbOffs visited sites in Nassarawa, Kaduna and Niger </p><p>states as well as within the Federal Capital Territory on </p><p>September 21. Personnel at most centers visited reported </p><p>that they did not have registration forms for between four </p><p>and six days of the ten-day period. Registration personnel </p><p>reported initially receiving forms for fifty percent of the </p><p>expected turnout for each location. During the course of </p><p>the ten-day effort, some sites sporadically received fresh </p><p>supplies, usually only a few dozen at a time. Several </p><p>reported receiving no further materials after the initial </p><p>supply had been exhausted. Late that afternoon, new forms </p><p>arrived at some sites, but in insufficient quantities to </p><p>cover most of the prospective registrants who had been </p><p>waiting for hours. In many areas, voters had tired of </p><p>waiting in line. Instead, as a delivery of forms came, the </p><p>local grapevine would spread the word and applicants would </p><p>return to queue again.  In some centers, officials gave out </p><p>line tickets to help preserve order and good humor. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) In Kaduna, similar shortages were apparent in both </p><p>the northern (Muslim) and southern (Christian) districts of </p><p>the city. Emboffs observed fully-staffed registration </p><p>centers standing idle for want of materials. </p><p>Representative Florence Aya (PDP-Kaduna) declared that "one </p><p>million new forms" would be required to complete the </p><p>registration process in Kaduna.  In some instances, </p><p>frustrated citizens vented their anger at INEC officials, </p><p>but for the most part, people channeled their frustration </p><p>in the form of harmless taunting of the INEC officials. </p><p>There was one report of an angry would-be registrant </p><p>opening fire on queue-jumpers at a registration center in </p><p>Abuja (four injuries, none fatal). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) While exact numbers are not yet available, credible </p><p>estimates suggest fifty percent of eligible voters who </p><p>wanted to register might have been denied the chance. The </p><p>true figure could vary significantly, as we cannot know the </p><p>number of citizens who could not spare the hours (sometimes </p><p>days) required to register.  Critics continue to highlight </p><p>INEC inefficiency (Ref B) and incompetence as the primary </p><p>reason for serious problems with the exercise. Some also </p><p>cite anecdotes of multiple registrations, registration of </p><p>minors, hoarding of forms by political players, and other </p><p>fraudulent practices.  INEC sticks by its original </p><p>estimates that the original 70 million forms along with the </p><p>2 million supplemental forms should have been enough to </p><p>register every eligible voter.  Attempting to shift the </p><p>blame from INEC\'s national secretariat, Baba-Ahmed </p><p>continued to reiterate his claim that "local officials, </p><p>politicians and fraudsters" hoarded or sold the forms. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) COMMENT: INEC\'s decision to close the registration </p><p>period without resolving the complaints about the lack of </p><p>forms and the resultant failure to register significant </p><p>numbers of eligible voters is troubling.  To make the </p><p>voters list as credible and as publicly acceptable as </p><p>possible, INEC should extend the process to allow all </p><p>willing and eligible Nigerians to register. If INEC does </p><p>not extend the process or waits too long to make the </p><p>decision, the numerous complaints that INEC was incompetent </p><p>or unprepared will turn into cries that, from the outset, </p><p>INEC intended the registration process to be unfair. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
