<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 JERUSALEM 003642 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: 11/05/00 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, KWBG, KISL, PLO, KPAL, PTER, IS </p><p>SUBJECT: PALESTINIANS EXPRESS SHOCK, ANXIETY ABOUT THE </p><p>FUTURE, AFTER RABIN ASSASSINATION </p><p> </p><p>1.  CLASSIFIED BY EDWARD G. ABINGTON, CONSUL GENERAL. </p><p>1.5B-D.  THIS IS A JOINT CONGEN JERUSALEM, EMBASSY TEL </p><p>AVIV CABLE. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY.  PALESTINIANS HAVE REACTED WITH SHOCK TO </p><p>THE NOVEMBER 4 ASSASSINATION OF ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER </p><p>YITZHAK RABIN, FOLLOWED BY ANXIETY ABOUT WHAT HIS DEATH </p><p>MEANS TO THE PEACE PROCESS AND THEIR FUTURE.  WEST BANK </p><p>AND GAZA ARE UNDER CLOSURE FOR AN INDEFINITE PERIOD, AND </p><p>TOWNS WERE QUIET.  YASIR ARAFAT AND OTHER PA OFFICIALS </p><p>HAVE EXPRESSED THEIR SHOCK AND SADNESS REGARDING RABIN\'S </p><p>DEATH, AND VOW THAT THE PEACE PROCESS WILL NOT BE </p><p>DISRUPTED AS A RESULT.  MAMAS AND PIJ "CELEBRATIONS" </p><p>HAVE BEEN FIRMLY PROHIBITED; PALESTINIAN SECURITY CHIEFS </p><p>DO NOT EXPECT THAT ISLAMISTS WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE </p><p>CRISIS TO CARRY OUT OPERATIONS.  PPF DEPLOYMENT INTO </p><p>JENIN HAS BEEN DELAYED, PROBABLY ONLY FOR A FEW DAYS. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>WEST BANK/GAZA QUIET AS PALESTINIANS ABSORB THE NEWS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  THE WEST BANK AND GAZA WAS ABNORMALLY QUIET THE DAY </p><p>AFTER RABIN\'S ASSASSINATION, WITH MOST PALESTINIANS </p><p>APPEARING TO BE IN SHOCK ABOUT THE NEWS OF HIS MURDER </p><p>AND ANXIOUS ABOUT THE IMPACT IT WILL HAVE ON THE PEACE </p><p>PROCESS AND THEIR FUTURE.  THE GOI IMPOSED A COMPLETE </p><p>CLOSURE ON THE TERRITORIES--FOR AN INDEFINITE </p><p>PERIOD--THAT ENSURED THAT MANY PALESTINIANS REMAINED IN </p><p>THEIR HOMES, GLUED TO THEIR TELEVISIONS AND RADIOS </p><p>LISTENING TO NEWS REPORTS.  MANY WERE UP LATE THE NIGHT </p><p>OF THE KILLING, UNABLE TO SLEEP, AND THOSE AT BUSINESSES </p><p>AND COFFEE SHOPS NOVEMBER 5 SPENT THE DAY DISCUSSING THE </p><p>EVENT AND ITS EXPECTED IMPACT. </p><p> </p><p>4.  GAZA CIVIL POLICE CHIEF GHAZI JABALI SAID PA POLICE </p><p>WERE NOT ALLOWING PALESTINIANS TO EXPRESS JOY AT THE </p><p>KILLING OF RABIN, BUT ADDED THAT SO FAR NO CELEBRATIONS </p><p>BROKE OUT, AND ONE THAT THREATENED TO OCCUR AT KHAN </p><p>YUNIS WAS SQUASHED BY PA POLICE.  ON INSTRUCTIONS FROM </p><p>ARAFAT, JERICHO PREVENTIVE SECURITY CHIEF JIBRIL RAJOUB </p><p>MET WITH WEST BANK MAMAS LEADERS IN THE EARLY MORNING </p><p>HOURS OF NOVEMBER 5 TO CONVEY ARAFAT\'S WARNING THAT </p><p>THERE WERE TO BE NO DISRESPECTFUL DEMONSTRATIONS IN THE </p><p>STREETS.  RAJOUB SAID THAT MAMAS WAS TO CONVEY THE SAME </p><p>MESSAGE TO THE PIJ.  BOTH RAJOUB AND WEST BANK PPF </p><p>COMMANDER HAJ ISMAIL JABBER BELIEVED THE WEST BANK WOULD </p><p>REMAIN QUIET, BUT THE POTENTIAL FOR INSTABILITY DEPENDED </p><p>ON DEVELOPMENTS IN ISRAEL IN THE DAYS AND WEEKS AHEAD. </p><p> </p><p>5.  BETHLEHEM MAYOR ILYAS FREIJ WAS "TERRIBLY UPSET," </p><p>SAYING HE KNEW RABIN AS A FRIEND.  HE COMMENTED ON WHAT </p><p>COULD BE A "DISTURBING PHENOMENA IF EVERY LEADER WHO </p><p>TRIES TO MAKE PEACE IN THE REGION IS THREATENED WITH </p><p>GUNS."  JENIN MAYOR WALID ABU MUWAYZ SAID JENIN </p><p>RESIDENTS ARE SADDENED BY THE KILLING AND HOPE IT WILL </p><p>NOT AFFECT THE SCHEDULE FOR REDEPLOYMENT IN THEIR TOWN. </p><p>NABLUS MAYOR GHASSAN SHAKA SAID IT WAS A SAD DAY FOR </p><p>NABLUS, AND HE HOPES RABIN\'S DEATH WILL NOT HAVE A </p><p>CATASTROPHIC EFFECT ON THE PEACE PROCESS.  FATAH </p><p>SUPPORTER AZZAM AL-ARAJ IN TULKAREM SAID THE PEOPLE </p><p>THERE ARE SHOCKED AND SADDENED, EVEN THE YOUNG ACTIVISTS </p><p>AT AN-NAJAH UNIVERSITY WHERE HE TEACHES. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ARAFAT, PA OFFICIALS SHAKEN, SADDENED BY THE NEWS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>6.  PA OFFICIALS PUBLICLY EXPRESSED THEIR SADNESS AND </p><p>SHOCK TOWARDS THE ATTACK AND SENT CONDOLENCES TO THE </p><p>ISRAELI PEOPLE, AND FLAGS AT PA BUILDINGS WERE AT HALF </p><p>MAST.  YASIR ARAFAT, LOOKING VISIBLY SHAKEN AND SPEAKING </p><p>HALTINGLY AND QUIETLY, SAID PUBLICLY NOVEMBER 4 THAT HE </p><p>WAS "VERY SAD AND VERY SHOCKED BY THIS TERRIBLE CRIME, </p><p>AGAINST A GREAT ISRAELI LEADER AND AN ARCHITECT OF </p><p>PEACE.  IN THE NAME OF THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE, I SEND MY </p><p>CONDOLENCES TO MRS. RABIN, HER FAMILY, THE ISRAELI </p><p>GOVERNMENT AND THE ENTIRE ISRAELI PEOPLE.  I HOPE WE </p><p>WILL SUCCEED IN OVERCOMING THIS TRAGEDY, WHICH IS A BLOW </p><p>TO THE PEACE PROCESS."  ARAFAT\'S JERICHO OFFICE DIRECTOR </p><p>SAMI MUSALLAM SAID ARAFAT WAS VERY UPSET BY THE </p><p>ASSASSINATION, AND HAD NOT SEEN HIM IN SUCH A STATE </p><p>SINCE THE ASSASSINATIONS OF ABU JIHAD AND ABU IYAD. </p><p>OTHER PA OFFICIALS, INCLUDING MILITARY LEADERS, WERE </p><p>ALSO UPSET, SAYING THE REGION HAD LOST A GREAT MAN OF </p><p>PEACE AND CALLING THE KILLING A DISASTER AND A </p><p>CATASTROPHE.  MANY OF THE PALESTINIAN POLITICAL, </p><p>SECURITY, AND ECONOMIC FIGURES VOICED A SENSE OF RELIEF </p><p>THAT THE ASSASSIN WAS NOT PALESTINIAN. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>WORRIES ABOUT THE FUTURE, IMPACT ON THE PEACE PROCESS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  ALL PALESTINIANS EXPRESSED ANXIETY ABOUT THE EFFECT </p><p>OF THE KILLING ON THE PEACE PROCESS.  PA MINISTER OF </p><p>LOCAL AFFAIRS SA\'EB ERAKAT SAID "WE HAVE AN AGREEMENT, </p><p>BUT OBVIOUSLY THIS COULD AFFECT IMPLEMENTATION."  HE </p><p>EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT THE PHENOMENON OF THE ISRAELI </p><p>RIGHT WING\'S VIOLENCE IN OPPOSING THE PEACE PROCESS AND </p><p>WONDERED HOW THAT WILL EFFECT CO-EXISTENCE BETWEEN THE </p><p>TWO PEOPLES AND WHAT SUCH EXTREMISTS HAVE IN STORE FOR </p><p>PALESTINIANS DURING IMPLEMENTATION OF THE INTERIM </p><p>AGREEMENT AND ELECTIONS.  HE SAID PALESTINIANS CONTINUE </p><p>TO MOVE FORWARD ON PREPARATIONS FOR PALESTINIAN </p><p>ELECTIONS.  (NOTE:  THE PA CABINET YESTERDAY CONFIRMED </p><p>THE JANUARY 20 ELECTION DATE.) </p><p> </p><p>8.  HEBRON UNIVERSITY PUBLIC RELATIONS DIRECTOR NABIL </p><p>ABU ZNEID EXPRESSED THE CONCERN OF MANY PALESTINIANS </p><p>WHEN HE SAID THE VOID LEFT BY RABIN MAY BE IMPOSSIBLE TO </p><p>FILL.  HE FELT THE CURRENT PEACE PROCESS WAS LESS A </p><p>PEACE BETWEEN PALESTINIANS AND ISRAELIS BUT MORE A PEACE </p><p>BETWEEN ARAFAT AND RABIN.  OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS THE </p><p>RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO HAD GRADUALLY GROWN </p><p>STRONGER AND MORE TRUSTING, AND THE TWO HAVE MADE BRAVE </p><p>DECISIONS FOR PEACE.  HE SAID "WE\'VE LOST A GREAT MAN," </p><p>AND LAMENTED THAT THERE IS NO OTHER ISRAELI LEADER AT </p><p>THIS TIME WITH RABIN\'S PRO-PEACE ATTITUDE COUPLED WITH </p><p>MILITARY EXPERTISE AND KNOW-HOW. </p><p> </p><p>9.  WEST BANK FATAH AND BUSINESS LEADERS WERE ALSO </p><p>SHOCKED AND PESSIMISTIC ABOUT THE FUTURE WITHOUT RABIN. </p><p>HIGHER COUNCIL MEMBER AHMAD AD-DEEK AND RAMALLAH LEADER </p><p>HUSSEIN ASH-SHEIKH ARE AFRAID HIS DEATH MARKS THE END OF </p><p>THE PEACE PROCESS.  THEY FEAR THE PROCESS WILL BE </p><p>SUSPENDED UNTIL THE NEXT ISRAELI ELECTION.  PADICO </p><p>EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AMIN HADDAD SAID "WE ALL BELIEVE THIS </p><p>IS A HUGE LOSS TO THE PEACE PROCESS; NO PALESTINIAN WHO </p><p>IS THOUGHTFUL IS REJOICING."  CAIRO AMMAN BANK REGIONAL </p><p>MANAGER YUSUF BAZIAN SAID "ISRAELIS MAY HESITATE EVEN </p><p>MORE ABOUT TAKING DIFFICULT STEPS THAT THEY MUST TAKE; </p><p>MOREOVER, THEY MAY WONDER IF PEACE IS WORTH THE PRICE." </p><p> </p><p>10.  MANY PALESTINIANS ALSO WORRIED ABOUT THE INTERNAL </p><p>SITUATION INSIDE ISRAEL, AND WERE INCREDULOUS THAT THE </p><p>KILLING HAS PERPETRATED BY AN ISRAELI.  HADDAD SAID THE </p><p>ASSASSINATION INDICATES THAT "ISRAEL HAS TRULY JOINED </p><p>THE MIDDLE EAST."  ANIS AL-QAQ, DEPUTY MINISTER IN THE </p><p>MINISTRY OF PLANNING, WONDERED IF ISRAEL WOULD COME </p><p>TOGETHER OR FRACTURE FURTHER OVER THE LOSS OF RABIN. </p><p>"MANY OF US WHO KNOW ISRAEL BELIEVE THE PRIDE OF ISRAELI </p><p>DEMOCRACY AND SENSE OF MORAL CERTAINTY WAS ALSO SHOT </p><p>YESTERDAY." </p><p> </p><p>11.  MANY FEAR PERES IS NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO HOLD ISRAEL </p><p>OR THE PEACE PROCESS TOGETHER.  SAMI MUSALLAM, DIRECTOR </p><p>OF ARAFAT\'S OFFICE IN JERICHO, SAID THAT ALTHOUGH PERES </p><p>ENJOYS SUPPORT AMONG YOUNGER IDF OFFICERS, HE DOES NOT </p><p>HAVE CLOSE RELATIONS WITH ANY OF THE CURRENT CLASS OF </p><p>REGIONAL AND FORCE COMMANDERS.  THE PALESTINIANS ARE </p><p>EXTREMELY WORRIED THAT PERES WILL NOT BE ABLE TO BRING </p><p>THE MILITARY TO HEEL DURING REDEPLOYMENT, IN THE WAY </p><p>RABIN HAD DONE.  THEY ARE WATCHING CLOSELY TO SEE WHO </p><p>WILL BE NAMED MINISTER OF DEFENSE IN ROBIN\'S STEAD. </p><p>MUSALLAM SAID THAT AMNON SHAHAK WOULD BE FAR PREFERABLE </p><p>TO EHUD BARAK, IN TERMS OF EACH MAN\'S SUPPORT FOR THE </p><p>PEACE PROCESS.  PALESTINIAN NEGOTIATOR HASSAN ASFOUR, </p><p>HOWEVER, SAID THAT DURING THE NOVEMBER 4 PA CABINET </p><p>MEETING, THE CABINET WISHED FOR AN ISRAELI LEADERSHIP </p><p>"DREAM TEAM" MADE UP OF PERES AS PRIME MINISTER, EHUD </p><p>BARAK AS DEFENSE MINISTER, AND HAIM RAMON AS FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER.  MANY PALESTINIANS FEAR THAT NETANYAHU WILL </p><p>HAVE AN EASY TIME DEFEATING PERES IN FUTURE ELECTIONS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PALESTINIANS HOPE GOI WILL COCK DOWN ON ITS EXTREMISTS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  A COMMON REACTION AMONG PALESTINIANS WAS THAT </p><p>RABIN\'S MURDER WOULD HURT THE FAR-RIGHT OPPONENTS OF </p><p>PEACE.  PALESTINE BUSINESSMEN\'S ASSOCIATION LEADER HANI </p><p>ABU DAYYEH SAID THE KILLING WOULD DISCREDIT THE </p><p>FAR-RIGHT AND GIVE THE GOI THE CHANCE TO ACT AGAINST </p><p>ISRAELI EXTREMISTS THAT "HAS MISSED AFTER THE HEBRON </p><p>MASSACRE."   AL-QAQ COMMENTED THAT "ISRAEL HAS </p><p>OVERLOOKED A TREND TOWARD VIOLENT FORCES ALLOWED TO </p><p>OPERATE WITHIN ITS SOCIETY--THIS CAN NO LONGER BE </p><p>IGNORED.  THIS IS THE MOST PAINFUL PRICE ISRAEL CAN PAY </p><p>FOR ALLOWING PARTS OF THE SOCIETY TO ACT AS IF THEY WERE </p><p>ABOVE THE LAW." </p><p> </p><p>13.  PPF POLICE CHIEF NASIR YUSIF SAID THE ASSASSINATION </p><p>HAS A "CATASTROPHE" THAT WILL "NO DOUBT IMPOSE ON ALL </p><p>THE NEED TO CONFRONT WITH ALL FIRMNESS EXTREMISM IN THE </p><p>REGION."  GAZA PREVENTIVE SECURITY CHIEF MUHAMMAD DAHLAN </p><p>SAID IT "SHOULD BE A LESSON FOR THE ISRAELIS TO SEE THE </p><p>DANGER IN THEIR OWN EXTREMISTS."  FORMER PEACE TERMER </p><p>NABIL KASSIS SAID IN ORDER TO LESSEN THE INFLUENCE OF </p><p>THE EXTREMISTS, THE GOI IN GENERAL MUST WORK HARDER TO </p><p>EDUCATE ITS PEOPLE ABOUT PEACEFUL CO-EXISTENCE WITH </p><p>PALESTINIANS OTHER THAN VIEWING THEM ONLY AS A SECURITY </p><p>THREAT.  WHILE BETHLEHEM MAYOR FREIJ HOPES THE </p><p>ASSASSINATION WILL UNDERCUT THE CREDIBILITY OF THE </p><p>ISRAELI EXTREMISTS, HE WORRIES THAT IT MAY INSTEAD MAKE </p><p>THEM MORE AGGRESSIVE. </p><p> </p><p></p><p>MAMAS, PIJ RELATIVELY QUIET, FOR NOW </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>14.  MAMAS AND PIJ SUPPORTERS WERE GENERALLY QUIET, WITH </p><p>PA SECURITY OFFICERS AND FATAH MEMBERS THROUGHOUT THE </p><p>WEST BANK AND GAZA ENSURING THAT CELEBRATIONS WOULD NOT </p><p>OCCUR.  TEL AVIV POLOFF SAW NO INDICATION OF EXTREMIST </p><p>CELEBRATIONS IN GAZA.  SALAH SAKKA, A GAZA CITY COUNCIL </p><p>MEMBER, SAID THAT THE MOOD LAST NIGHT IN KHAN YUNIS </p><p>AMONG ISLAMISTS HAS HAPPY, BUT THERE WERE NO PUBLIC </p><p>RALLIES, JUST BULLETS SHOT INTO THE AIR.  PA POLICE </p><p>PRESENCE IN KHAN YUNIS HAS VERY HIGH.  PLO CHAIRMAN </p><p>ARAFAT TOLD THE CG THAT STRICT ORDERS HAD GONE OUT TO </p><p>PREVENT CELEBRATIONS, INCLUDING FIRING IN THE AIR. </p><p> </p><p>15.  IN HEBRON, SOME ISLAMIC SUPPORTERS FELT RABIN\'S </p><p>KILLING HAS AN EVENT WORTH CELEBRATING--SEEING IT AS AN </p><p>END TO THE PEACE PROCESS--BUT DID NOT YET ACT ON THAT </p><p>IMPULSE.  HEBRON LEADERS SAID THE CITY WAS COWLING WITH </p><p>IDF SOLDIERS.  PALESTINIAN EXTREMISTS WERE ALSO HOPING </p><p>RABIN\'S MURDER WILL LEAD TO MORE DIVISIONS IN ISRAELI </p><p>SOCIETY.  HAMAS FOLLOWERS IN TULKAREM REPORTEDLY </p><p>CONSIDERED THE ASSASSINATION THE "ACT OF A COWARD." </p><p>KHALIL SHIQAQI, RESEARCH DIRECTOR AT THE CENTER FOR </p><p>PALESTINE RESEARCH AND STUDIES IN NABLUS AND BROTHER OF </p><p>RECENTLY ASSASSINATED PALESTINE ISLAMIC JIHAD LEADER </p><p>FATHI SHIQAQI, SAID THAT SOME OF THE RADICAL PALESTINIAN </p><p>FACTIONS ARE SAYING THAT RABIN\'S ASSASSINATION WAS "AN </p><p>ACT OF GOD," IMPLYING THAT THEY WILL NOT HAVE TO AVENGE </p><p>SHIQAQI\'S DEATH. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DELAYS EXPECTED, BUT PEACE PROCESS MUST CONTINUE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>16.  MANY PALESTINIANS UNDERSTAND SOME DELAYS ARE TO BE </p><p>EXPECTED IN THE PEACE PROCESS AS A RESULT OF ROBIN\'S </p><p>DEATH, BUT HOPE PRESIDENT CLINTON AND OTHER LEADERS WILL </p><p>STRESS THE IMPORTANCE OF BRAVELY GOING FORWARD AT </p><p>RABIN\'S FUNERAL.  CAB REGIONAL MANAGER BAZIAN SAID </p><p>PALESTINIANS MUST BE SMART AND "UNDERSTAND THE THE </p><p>ISRAELIS WILL NEED TIME TO SORT THIS OUT.  WE SHOULD </p><p>GIVE THEM THIS TIME, BUT INSIST ON OUR RIGHTS UNDER THE </p><p>AGREEMENT."  WEST BANK PPF COMMANDER HAJJ ISMAIL </p><p>REPORTED THAT HE HAD SPOKEN WITH IDF CENTRAL COMMAND MG </p><p>ILAN BIRAN EARLIER IN THE DAY NOVEMBER 5 TO CONVEY HIS </p><p>CONDOLENCES AND DISCUSS THE EFFECT OF THE ASSASSINATION </p><p>ON PLANS FOR REDEPLOYMENT.  ANOTHER PPF CONTINGENT HAD </p><p>BEEN SCHEDULED TO DEPART JERICHO FOR JENIN NOVEMBER 5; </p><p>HAJ ISMAIL AGREED TO BIRAN\'S REQUEST THAT ANY MOVEMENT </p><p>ON REDEPLOYMENT BE POSTPONED FOR "A FEW DAYS."  HAJ </p><p>ISMAIL DID NOT EXPECT THAT THE REDEPLOYMENT/DEPLOYMENT </p><p>SCHEDULE WOULD BE UNDULY DELAYED BUT ECHOES MUSALLEM\'S </p><p>CONCERN THAT PERES MAY NOT BE ABLE TO MAKE THE IDF KEEP </p><p>ITS REDEPLOYMENT COMMITTMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>ABINGTON </p><p></p></div>
