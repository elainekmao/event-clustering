(C) SUMMARY: ON NOVEMBER 1, AMBASSADOR AND POLOFF </p><p>MET WITH NEW ZANU-PF MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT SAVIOUR </p><p>"TYSON" KASUKUWERE TO DISCUSS A VARIETY OF ISSUES, </p><p>INCLUDING DEVELOPMENTS IN HIS PARTY.  KASUKUWERE, A </p><p>YOUNGISH BUSINESSMAN WITH STRONG PARTY TIES, SAID THAT </p><p>THE LAND ISSUE HAD BEEN BLOWN OUT OF PROPORTION AND THAT </p><p>FARMLAND SHOULD NOT BE TAKEN AWAY FROM WHITE FARMERS BY </p><p>FORCE.  HE ALSO PLAINLY STATED THAT PRESIDENT MUGABE AND </p><p>HIS CRONIES MUST BE PHASED OUT OF THEIR LEADERSHIP ROLE </p><p>AND PROPOSED THAT THE TWO VICE-PRESIDENTS SHOULD STEP </p><p>DOWN AS A FIRST STEP.  THE MP STRUCK A MORE MODERATE </p><p>TONE THAN HIS "OLD GUARD" COUNTERPARTS IN PARLIAMENT, </p><p>BUT HE IS STILL VERY MUCH A ZANU-PF LOYALIST WITH A </p><p>SHADY BACKGROUND.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>MP DEBATES LAND </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) ON NOVEMBER 1, AMBASSADOR AND POLOFF (NOTETAKER) </p><p>MET WITH THE NEW ZANU-PF MP FOR MOUNT DARWIN SOUTH </p><p>SAVIOUR "TYSON" KASUKUWERE, TO DISCUSS A VARIETY OF </p><p>ISSUES, INCLUDING LAND AND POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS IN HIS </p><p>PARTY.  ON LAND, HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE ISSUE HAD </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  06189  01 OF 02  021438Z </p><p>BECOME POLITICIZED AND HAD BEEN ALLOWED TO BECOME </p><p>"EVERYTHING" IN POLITICAL DEBATE.  COMMERCIAL FARMLAND </p><p>SHOULD NOT BE TAKEN FORCEFULLY FROM THEIR OWNERS, BUT </p><p>THERE IS A NEED FOR LAND REDISTRIBUTION, KASUKUWERE </p><p>OFFERED.  WHEN ASKED BY THE AMBASSADOR ON THE WAY </p><p>FORWARD ON LAND REFORM, THE MP SAID THAT ZIMBABWE WILL </p><p>AT SOME POINT HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE DONORS TO FINANCE </p><p>FARM PURCHASES.  THE AMBASSADOR STRESSED THAT DONORS </p><p>WERE VERY UNLIKELY TO RESUME FUNDING UNTIL LAW AND ORDER </p><p>HAD BEEN RESTORED ON THE FARMS.  KASUKUWERE STATED THAT </p><p>SQUATTERS MUST BE REMOVED FROM FARMS NOT DESIGNATED FOR </p><p>COMPULSORY ACQUISITION, IMPLYING THAT SQUATTERS ON </p><p>DESIGNATED PROPERTIES SHOULD REMAIN. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>NEW DEAL ON MUGABE SUCCESSION? </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3.  THE CONVERSATION TURNED TO ZANU-PF INTERNAL POLITICS </p><p>AND THE SUCCESSION ISSUE.  KASUKUWERE OPENLY STATED THAT </p><p>PRESIDENT MUGABE AND HIS CRONIES MUST BE PHASED OUT IN </p><p>ORDER FOR ZANU-PF TO SURVIVE.  THE MP SUGGESTED THAT </p><p>SOME IN THE PARTY ARE TRYING TO GET THE TWO AGED VICE- </p><p>PRESIDENTS, SIMON MUZENDA AND JOSEPH MSIKA, TO STEP DOWN </p><p>AS A FIRST STEP.  THAT WOULD THEN PROVIDE A STEPPING </p><p>STONE FOR YOUNGER MEN SUCH AS SIMBA MAKONI OR SYDNEY </p><p>SEKERAMAYI TO MOVE UP INTO A POSITION TO BECOME THE </p><p>PARTY\'S CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT.  WHEN ASKED ABOUT </p><p>MAKONI\'S POWER BASE, KASUKUWERE SAID THAT MAKONI HAS </p><p>ENOUGH CONNECTIONS WITH BUSINESS AND AN UNDERSTANDING OF </p><p>POLITICS TO MAKE HIM THE NEXT PRESIDENT.  HE IS NOT A </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  06189  01 OF 02  021438Z </p><p>TECHNOCRAT, AS MANY HAVE SAID, BUT HAS HIS OWN BASE OF </p><p>SUPPORT.  KASUKUWERE SUGGESTED THAT SPEAKER OF </p><p>PARLIAMENT EMMERSON MNANGAGWA AND FORMER HOME AFFAIRS </p><p>MINISTER DUMISO DABENGWA ARE ALSO CONTENDERS FOR VICE- </p><p>PRESIDENT, AND EVENTUALLY, PRESIDENT.  MNANGAGWA HAS </p><p>EARNED A GREAT DEAL OF RESPECT ACROSS THE POLITICAL </p><p>SPECTRUM FOR HIS EVENHANDEDNESS IN OVERSEEING </p><p>PARLIAMENT, THE MP OPINED.  (COMMENT: MNANGAGWA\'S </p><p>EVENHANDEDNESS HAS BEEN SELECTIVE.  HE STILL QUELLS </p><p>DEBATE AND MANIPULATES PARLIAMENTARY PROCEDURE IN ZANU- </p><p>PF\'S FAVOR WHEN CRITICAL VOTES ARE ON THE LINE.  THE </p><p>SPEAKER IS ALSO REPUTED TO BE FEARED AND DISLIKED BY </p><p>SENIOR MEMBERS OF HIS OWN PARTY.  KASUKUWERE\'S REMARKS </p><p>SUGGEST THAT HE MUST BE ONE OF MNANGAGWA\'S FEW VOCAL </p><p>SUPPORTERS.  END COMMENT.)  EVERYONE IN ZANU-PF CAN </p><p>"READ THE SIGNS" THAT CHANGE IS COMING, EVEN THE OLD </p><p>GUARD, KASUKUWERE SAID.  THE PARTY CANNOT AFFORD TO </p><p>POSTPONE REFORM ANY LONGER, BUT, NONETHELESS, IT MUST BE </p><p>CARRIED OUT IN A MANAGED WAY, THE MP REMARKED. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>LOCAL ELECTIONS AND THE DRC </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ3650 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  06189  02 OF 02  021438Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DINT-00  DODE-00  DOTE-00 </p><p>      SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00   FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00 </p><p>      H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00 </p><p>      OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00 </p><p>      SP-00    IRM-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02 </p><p>      G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /006W </p><p>                  ------------------99F110  021438Z /38 </p><p>R 021437Z NOV 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 7506 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 006189 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR CHARLES GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>PASS USTR FOR ROSA WHITAKER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/02/10 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR MEETS WITH ZIMBABWE RULING PARTY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  06189  02 OF 02  021438Z </p><p>"YOUNG TURK" </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) KASUKUWERE WRAPPED UP BY SAYING THAT THE GOZ IS </p><p>DELAYING MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS IN HARARE AND OTHER CITIES </p><p>UNTIL ZANU-PF CAN WORK OUT A PLAN TO WIN THEM.  IF </p><p>ELECTIONS WERE HELD TOMORROW, THE MDC WOULD CLEARLY </p><p>SWEEP EVERY CITY COUNCIL AND MAYORSHIP, THE MP ADMITTED. </p><p>HE ALSO AFFIRMED THAT HE IS CHAIRMAN OF THE DEFENSE AND </p><p>HOME AFFAIRS COMMITTEE IN PARLIAMENT, AND THAT HE HAS </p><p>SPOKEN WITH PRESIDENT MUGABE ABOUT WITHDRAWING </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S TROOPS FROM THE DRC.  HE SAID, WITHOUT </p><p>ELABORATING, THAT SOME TROOPS HAVE ALREADY BEEN BROUGHT </p><p>BACK HOME. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) COMMENT: KASUKUWERE STRUCK A MORE MODERATE TONE </p><p>IN HIS REMARKS THAN HIS "OLD GUARD" COUNTERPARTS, AND </p><p>CLEARLY INDICATED BY WHAT HE TOLD US THAT HE COULD BE </p><p>CONSIDERED A "YOUNG TURK" IN THE PARTY (REFTEL). </p><p>HOWEVER, THAT DOES NOT MEAN HIS LOYALTY TO ZANU-PF IS </p><p>WAVERING, OR THAT HE IS CONSIDERING CLOSE COOPERATION </p><p>WITH THE MDC.  OTHER SOURCES HAVE TOLD US THAT THE </p><p>BRAWNY KASUKUWERE DIRECTED THE CAMPAIGN OF PRE-ELECTION </p><p>VIOLENCE AND INTIMIDATION IN HIS MOUNT DARWIN SOUTH </p><p>DISTRICT, ONE OF THE MOST HEAVILY AFFECTED AREAS.  IT </p><p>UNDOUBTEDLY CONTRIBUTED TO HIS SWEEPING VICTORY OVER HIS </p><p>MDC RIVAL.  HIS COMMENTS ABOUT GETTING THE VICE- </p><p>PRESIDENTS TO RESIGN ARE INTERESTING AND IT IS NOT </p><p>UNTHINKABLE THAT SUCH A PLAN MAY BE UNDER CONSIDERATION </p><p>WITHIN THE PARTY.  HOWEVER, IF THE OLD GUARD IS SOON </p><p>REPLACED BY THE YOUNGER GENERATION, IT MAY NOT </p><p>NECESSARILY HARBINGER A WHOLESALE CHANGE IN HOW ZANU-PF </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  06189  02 OF 02  021438Z </p><p>RUNS THE COUNTRY.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) BIO NOTE: SAVIOUR KASUKUWERE IS APPROXIMATELY </p><p>35-40 YEARS OLD.  HE ORIGINALLY HAILS FROM MARONDERA </p><p>DISTRICT, WHERE HIS FAMILY WAS INVOLVED IN THE 1970S </p><p>LIBERATION WAR.  HE ATTENDED UNIVERSITY IN BERLIN BEFORE </p><p>JOINING THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATION (CIO), </p><p>WHERE HE SERVED FOR 8-9 YEARS.  KASUKUWERE JOINED THE </p><p>PRESIDENT\'S OFFICE IN 1995 BEFORE BEING ELECTED TO </p><p>PARLIAMENT IN 2000.  HE OWNS A TRUCKING BUSINESS IN </p><p>MUTARE (FAR FROM HIS PARLIAMENTARY CONSTITUENCY OF MOUNT </p><p>DARWIN SOUTH--HE LIKES TO KEEP BUSINESS AND POLITICS </p><p>"SEPARATE," HE TOLD US.)  HE HAS GOOD ACCESS TO FINANCE </p><p>MINISTER SIMBA MAKONI, WHOM HE AND BUSINESS PARTNERS </p><p>APPROACHED RECENTLY FOR HELP IN OBTAINING FINANCING FOR </p><p>HIS BUSINESS OPERATIONS.  HE IS MARRIED WITH THREE YOUNG </p><p>CHILDREN.  END BIO NOTE. </p><p> </p><p>MCDONALD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
