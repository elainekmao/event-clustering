The `surprise\' </p><p>statement by Bush has given new impetus to the battered </p><p>relationship between the U.S. and Turkey.  President Bush </p><p>also told EU leaders that the U.S. would continue to press </p><p>for a settlement in Cyprus, and noted that disagreements on </p><p>the divided island should be tackled within the framework of </p><p>the UN-sponsored peace plan. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turkish Al-Qaeda suspects: Two Turks who were among the five </p><p>Al-Qaeda suspects apprehended in Malawi were handed over to </p><p>U.S. authorities.  Arif Ulusam and Ibrahim Habaci were </p><p>reportedly sent to the Guantanamo base.  The Turkish embassy </p><p>in South Africa presented a note of protest to Malawi, </p><p>saying that the Vienna Agreement obliged the Malawi </p><p>administration to give details about the fate of the </p><p>suspects. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turkey worried over safety of Iraqi pipeline: The MFA has </p><p>officially complained to the U.S. about the protection of </p><p>the Kirkuk-Yumurtalik oil pipeline carrying Iraqi oil to </p><p>world markets via Turkey.  The pipeline was sabotaged three </p><p>times in June, but might be reactivated in mid-July.  The </p><p>U.S. would like to resume Iraqi oil sales via the Kirkuk- </p><p>Yumurtalik pipeline as soon as possible. </p><p>More clerics for Religious Affairs: AKP officials said on </p><p>Wednesday that the government would not necessarily employ </p><p>any additional Muslim clerics.  The move  responded to </p><p>concern about appointing an additional 15,000 Muslim clerics </p><p>and preachers, instead of the initially-proposed 1,600, to </p><p>the Department of Religious Affairs (DIB).  Mainstream </p><p>papers believe that political instability could arise from </p><p>underlying tensions between the ruling AKP and the military. </p><p>Deputy prime minister Sahin said that  imams appointed by </p><p>the state and paid with official funds in Turkey\'s mosques </p><p>are a bulwark for the state.  Papers draw attention to </p><p>Turkey\'s growing need for teachers and doctors, and </p><p>criticize the AKP sharply for attempting to recruit more </p><p>Muslim clerics instead of solving problems in the education </p><p>and health sectors. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NSC meeting: The National Security Council (NSC) meeting on </p><p>Thursday will discuss amnesty for PKK militants. On Friday, </p><p>the Ministry of Interior will make an announcement regarding </p><p>a new amnesty law.  According to the draft, terror </p><p>organization defectors who have not been involved in armed </p><p>attacks will be set free if they provide information about </p><p>their affiliation.  Militants who agree to cooperate with </p><p>security forces will be given financial support and new </p><p>identities, according to press reports.  Justice Minister </p><p>Cemil Cicek said the intent of the bill is to disarm </p><p>supporters of terror in the Middle East.  The NSC will also </p><p>discuss the 7th package of EU harmonization laws.  The </p><p>package envisages amendments to the Penal Code that would </p><p>remove obstacles to freedom of expression.  The government </p><p>is determined to enact all necessary laws in order to meet </p><p>the Copenhagen Criteria before the parliament\'s summer </p><p>recess. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION: US policy in the post Iraq war </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The US changes its base policy" </p><p>Zafer Atay wrote in the economic-political Dunya (6/26): </p><p>"The US has decided to close down some of its military bases </p><p>around the world, including in Turkey.  There is ongoing </p><p>speculation that the US is acting vindictively against </p><p>certain countries.  However, in the post-cold war and post- </p><p>Iraq war era, the US does not need heavy-handed, money- </p><p>guzzling bases any more.  In the new international </p><p>atmosphere, where the Soviet threat does not exist and </p><p>Russia is considered a common friend, Washington\'s focus has </p><p>shifted to the Middle East and the Caucasus.  . Washington </p><p>is not looking for an ideological fight -- its main interest </p><p>is to eliminate the rouge states, both sponsors of terrorism </p><p>and producers of nuclear weapons. . It seems likely that US </p><p>bases will be opened in `less problematic\' friends of </p><p>Washington, such as Hungary, Bulgaria, Poland and Romania, </p><p>as well as in the `good allies\' of the Middle East region </p><p>such as Kuwait, Qatar and Oman.  In Asia, we can add </p><p>Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan to the list, because </p><p>they cannot afford to oppose any US action." </p><p>"The American image" </p><p>Fehmi Koru argued in the Islamist-intellectual Yeni Safak </p><p>(6/26): "President George Bush is suffering from a serious </p><p>image problem because his reliability is on such shaky </p><p>ground.  Recent opinion polls have only endorsed this </p><p>observation.  . It is likely that we will see the political </p><p>impact of this public opinion change both in the US as well </p><p>as in the UK.  For instance, the war-mongering lobby in </p><p>Washington must be very careful at every step from now on, </p><p>especially at a time when new military operations are being </p><p>contemplated.  The war-lobby might not find the UK on its </p><p>side if there is an operation against Iran prior to the 2004 </p><p>presidential elections. . Turkey\'s ruling AKP should be </p><p>watching developments very closely and should stay away from </p><p>any military involvement in Iraq.  Turkey\'s role should be </p><p>framed within UN resolutions and cover the Iraqi </p><p>reconstruction and humanitarian initiatives." </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
