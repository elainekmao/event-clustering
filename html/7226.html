Pro- </p><p>Islamic papers accuse Americans of `slaughtering\' women and </p><p>children in Baghdad, and shooting at everything that moved. </p><p>"Zaman" accuses U.S. of making a `show of force\' in a city </p><p>of six million civilians.  Reports regard the Saddam statue </p><p>demolished by local people in Karbala, and U.S. troops </p><p>entering Saddam\'a palaces as signs of psychological defeat </p><p>for the Iraqi regime.    "Cumhuriyet" says that during the </p><p>Ankara visit of the Iranian Foreign Minister Kharrazi, </p><p>Turkey and Iran have agreed to stand against a sovereign </p><p>Kurdish state, and a post-war government manufactured by </p><p>foreign powers.  Interests of neighboring countries should </p><p>be considered while Iraq\'s future is being restructured, the </p><p>two countries agreed.  "Cumhuriyet" underlines the fact that </p><p>Ankara did not want to be seen forming a coalition with Iran </p><p>and Syria, and that Foreign Minister Gul would seek a </p><p>bilateral understanding with Syria during his visit to </p><p>Damascus on Sunday.  Syrian Foreign Minister Al-Shara told a </p><p>private Turkish TV channel on Monday that Rumsfeld and other </p><p>U.S. officials\' allegations of the presence of WMD in Syria </p><p>were false.  `They\'ve invaded two-thirds of Iraq, but could </p><p>not find any WMD.  Their accusation of Syria possessing WMD </p><p>is groundless, and indicate the mistake they\'ve made in </p><p>Iraq,\' Al-Shara said.  Press commentaries are doubtful that </p><p>U.S. will fulfill its pledge to keep the Kurds away from </p><p>Mosul and Kirkuk, and draw attention to U.S. reluctance </p><p>about giving written guarantees.  Foreign Minister Gul </p><p>denied on Monday reports about a Turkish dipnote to U.S. on </p><p>the issue.  Dailies report talks between MFA and U.S. Ankara </p><p>Embassy continued regarding carriage of humanitarian aid and </p><p>logistical supply from Turkey to Northern Iraq, but that no </p><p>progress was recorded on the coordination mechanism for </p><p>monitoring developments in the region. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION:  Post war scenarios </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Now the real war starts" </p><p>Serdar Turgut commented in mass appeal Aksam (4/8): "It </p><p>seems that the CIA\'s influence will prevail over the view of </p><p>other departments about Ahmad Chalabi. He will no longer be </p><p>viewed as the key figure in the restructuring of Iraq.  In </p><p>the post-Saddam government, we should expect a group of </p><p>Americans serving as ministers in Iraq.  The US is very </p><p>determined to implement its `new world order,\' and the </p><p>formation of the new Iraqi government will demonstrate this </p><p>fact.  According to the CIA, James Woolsey is the leading </p><p>name for the new Information Minister in Iraq.  It is </p><p>interesting to see that certain elements within the </p><p>Washington administration do not even care about possible </p><p>uneasiness in the world concerning the appointment of a </p><p>former CIA chief as a minister in Iraq. . A recent report by </p><p>the Army War College clearly indicates that the US should </p><p>stay in the region for a long time in order to finish the </p><p>job.  `Reconstructing Iraq: Insights, Challenges and the </p><p>Mission for Military Forces in a post-conflict scenario\' </p><p>foresees no less than 135 major tasks to accomplish in Iraq </p><p>in the post-war period in order to prevent another crisis. </p><p>Turkey should be prepared for living with chaos in its </p><p>immediate neighborhood for a very long time." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"As Pandora\'s box opens" </p><p>Sedat Ergin wrote in mass appeal Hurriyet (4/8): "The US </p><p>will eventually claim victory as expected, but the next </p><p>phase of the Iraq issue -- the restructuring -- will be even </p><p>more critical than the war itself.  Iraq is made up of a </p><p>very complex set of ethnic groups and religious sects.  We </p><p>cannot even give a precise figure of the ethnic diversity, </p><p>since there has been no census since 1985. . However, the </p><p>new Iraqi structure can only function if all of the Iraqi </p><p>elements reach a consensus.  Yet finding a formula to </p><p>achieve such a consensus is certainly a very tough job. . It </p><p>is also possible to see many players assuming a role of </p><p>influence in the future Iraq, which could mean competition </p><p>and even conflict. . There is still a question yet to be </p><p>answered: To what extent will the people of Iraq accept the </p><p>US-imposed formula and move on with things?  How will the </p><p>restructuring of Iraq be turned to the establishment of </p><p>democracy with political parties?" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
