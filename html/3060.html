<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ROME 002660 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/31/2007 </p><p>TAGS: IT, MW, OPRC, PGOV, MW, OPRC, PGOV, SR, SRIT, EUN </p><p>SUBJECT: POSSIBLE ITALIAN INDICTMENT OF MONTENEGRIN </p><p>PRESIDENT </p><p> </p><p>REF: BELGRADE 1312 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: POL MIN-COUNS THOMAS COUNTRYMAN, 1.5 B AND D </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: THE APPARENT INTENTION OF THE INDEPENDENT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  02660  01 OF 02  311621Z </p><p>ANTI-MAFIA PROSECUTOR TO PROCEED WITH AN INVESTIGATION OF </p><p>PRESIDENT DJUKANOVIC IS A NOT UNEXPECTED RESULT OF A </p><p>YEARS-LONG PROBE, AND A MASSIVE ONGOING TRIAL, INTO CIGARETTE </p><p>SMUGGLING ACROSS THE ADRIATIC.  IT IS NOT/NOT, HOWEVER, </p><p>MOTIVATED BY ANY POLITICAL INTENTION ON THE PART OF THE </p><p>ITALIAN GOVERNMENT.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) ITALIAN PRESS HAS REPORTED IN DETAIL ON THE INTENTION </p><p>OF THE ANTI-MAFIA PUBLIC PROSECUTOR IN BARI, GIUSEPPE SCELSI, </p><p>TO ENTER MONTENEGRIN PRESIDENT DJUKANOVIC ON THE LIST OF </p><p>PERSONS UNDER INVESTIGATION ON CHARGES OF MAFIA CONSPIRACY </p><p>FOR THE PURPOSE OF INTERNATIONAL TRAFFICKING IN CONTRABAND </p><p>CIGARETTES.  DETAILS OF THE POTENTIAL INDICTMENT, AS REVEALED </p><p>IN AN INTERVIEW WITH CHIEF ANTI-MAFIA PROSECUTOR PIERLUIGI </p><p>VIGNA, ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE PREVIOUSLY REVEALED IN ZAGREB\'S </p><p>"NACIONAL" AND OTHER REGIONAL PUBLICATIONS.  THEY INCLUDE: </p><p>THE INVOLVEMENT OF THE ITALIAN CRIME SYNDICATES IN THE </p><p>REGIONS OF NAPLES (CAMORRA) AND PUGLIA (SACRA CORONA UNITA); </p><p>PAYMENT TO DJUKANOVIC BY THE ITALIAN CRIME SYNDICATES OF UP </p><p>TO THREE MILLION USD A MONTH; AND LAUNDERING PROCEEDS THROUGH </p><p>THE CYPRIOT-BASED COMPANY DULWICH.  LEADING TURIN NEWSPAPER </p><p>"LA STAMPA" REPORTS THAT SCELSI IS ALSO HUNTING DOWN </p><p>DJUKANOVIC\'S ASSETS, ISSUING LETTERS ROGATORY SEEKING </p><p>INFORMATION ON DJUKANOVIC\'S ACCOUNTS TO AUTHORITIES IN CYPRUS </p><p>(COMMENT: GOOD LUCK!), SWITZERLAND AND OTHER EUROPEAN </p><p>COUNTRIES. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) ITALIAN PROSECUTORS ARE OBLIGATED BY LAW TO </p><p>INVESTIGATE ANY ALLEGATION OF CRIMINAL ACTIVITY THAT THEY </p><p>RECEIVE.  NORMALLY, A PROSECUTOR WOULD NOT RELEASE THE KIND </p><p>OF DETAILS THAT SCELSI HAS UNTIL THE INVESTIGATION HAD TURNED </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  02660  01 OF 02  311621Z </p><p>UP SIGNIFICANT CORROBORATING DETAIL OF THE ALLEGATION.  THE </p><p>BARI PROSECUTOR HAS BEEN PURSUING LEGAL ACTION AGAINST </p><p>CIGARETTE SMUGGLERS SINCE AT LEAST 1999, FOCUSING ON ITALIAN </p><p>CRIME FIGURES AND MULTINATIONAL TOBACCO COMPANIES EVEN MORE </p><p>THAN ON MONTENEGRINS.  TWENTY-EIGHT PEOPLE HAVE SO FAR </p><p>RECEIVED JAIL SENTENCES, ACCORDING TO THE PRESS.  ANOTHER 80 </p><p>SUSPECTS, THE MAJORITY OF THEM ITALIAN, ARE CURRENTLY ON </p><p>TRIAL IN BARI.  IN ADDITION, THE PROSECUTOR\'S TRAIL HAS </p><p>PROBABLY BEEN AIDED BY ARRESTS IN THE LAST EIGHTEEN MONTHS OF </p><p>LEADING ITALIAN CRIMINALS INVOLVED IN TOBACCO SMUGGLING. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) THERE ARE CONFLICTING REPORTS AS TO WHETHER OR NOT </p><p>SCELSI HAS RECEIVED AN OPINION FROM THE ITALIAN MFA ON </p><p>DJUKANOVIC ENJOYING IMMUNITY FROM PROSECUTION.  A SOURCE IN </p><p>SCELSI\'S OFFICE SAID HE HAD TAKEN THIS STEP BEFORE GOING </p><p>PUBLIC, BUT THE MFA HAS ISSUED A STRONG DENIAL THAT IT HAD </p><p>BEEN CONSULTED OR GIVEN AN OPINION.  EMBASSY HAS BEEN UNABLE </p><p>TO REACH AN AUTHORITATIVE OFFICIAL OF THE MFA WHO COULD </p><p>CONFIRM OR DENY, BUT WE WILL KEEP TRYING. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) LJUBISA PEROVIC, THE GOM\'S REPRESENTATIVE IN ROME, HAS </p><p>BEEN BESIEGED BY ITALIAN, SERBIAN AND MONTENEGRIN </p><p>JOURNALISTS.  HE TOLD POLMC MAY 30 THAT HE WAS FRUSTRATED BY </p><p>HIS INABILITY TO GET ANY CONCRETE INFORMATION FROM EITHER THE </p><p>MFA OR SCELSI\'S OFFICE.  (PEROVIC, WHO WAS YUGOSLAV </p><p>CONSUL-GENERAL IN BARI FOR FIVE YEARS BEFORE OPENING </p><p>MONTENEGRO\'S OFFICE IN ROME, DESCRIBED SCELSI AS A "CLOSE </p><p>FRIEND AND ADVERSARY.")  BY HIS INFORMATION, THE KEY EVIDENCE </p><p>AGAINST DJUKANOVIC HAD COME FROM A "PENTITO" (TERM USED FOR </p><p>MAFIA SMALL-FRY WHO TESTIFY AGAINST THEIR BOSSES), AN ITALIAN </p><p>WHO THE GOM HAD EXTRADITED FROM MONTENEGRO AT GOI REQUEST. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  02660  01 OF 02  311621Z </p><p>HE THOUGHT THAT THIS INDIVIDUAL WASN\'T ANYONE WHO WAS </p><p>ACTUALLY PERSONALLY KNOWN TO DJUKANOVIC, BUT CONCEDED IT WAS </p><p>POSSIBLE THAT THE PROSECUTOR HAD OTHER EVIDENCE AS WELL. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) PEROVIC PROBED FOR ANY INDICATION OF THE MOTIVES FOR </p><p>ANNOUNCING THE INVESTIGATION NOW, JUXTAPOSING IT SUCCESSIVELY </p><p>WITH: THE ITALIAN PARLIAMENT\'S DECISION TO FORM A SPECIAL </p><p>COMMITTEE TO INVESTIGATE FORMER FM DINI\'S ROLE IN THE SALE OF </p><p>SERBIA TELEKOM IN 1997; THE RECENT VISIT OF SERBIAN PM </p><p>DJINDJIC TO ROME; DJUKANOVIC\'S SUCCESS IN LOCAL ELECTIONS; </p><p>AND THIS WEEK\'S VISIT TO PODGORICA OF DEPUTY MINISTER OF </p><p>FOREIGN TRADE ADOLFO URSO, THE HIGHEST LEVEL GOI VISITOR IN </p><p>SOME MONTHS.  (JUST BEFORE THE NEW STORY BROKE, BOTH ITALIAN </p><p>AND MONTENEGRIN PRESS PROMINENTLY PLAYED URSO\'S PARTING </p><p>COMMENTS PRAISING MONTENEGRO FOR MEASURES TAKEN TO CURB </p><p>ILLEGAL CROSS-BORDER TRADE.)  HE ALSO CRITICIZED AT LENGTH </p><p>THE FINANCE MINISTER IN THE PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT, OTTAVIANO </p><p>DEL TURCO, WHO HAD MADE CRITICISM OF MONTENEGRO A TRADEMARK </p><p>OF HIS TENURE AND WAS AGAIN SHOOTING OFF HIS MOUTH.  HE NOTED </p><p>THAT ITALIAN PRESS CRITICISM OF MONTENEGRO AS A BASE FOR </p><p>SMUGGLERS, A STAPLE STORY IN 2000, HAD LARGELY DISAPPEARED. </p><p>PEROVIC SAID THAT THIS WAS NOT BECAUSE OF THE CHANGE IN </p><p>ITALIAN GOVERNMENT IN MAY 2001, BUT BECAUSE THE PROBLEM HAD </p><p>LARGELY BEEN BROUGHT UNDER CONTROL.  (COMMENT: IT\'S TRUE THAT </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ4434 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  02660  02 OF 02  311622Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   CIAE-00  INL-00   DODE-00  SRPP-00 </p><p>      DS-00    FBIE-00  VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   L-00 </p><p>      VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00 </p><p>      PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SCT-00   SP-00    SSO-00 </p><p>      TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00 </p><p>      SAS-00   SWCI-00    /006W </p><p>                  ------------------B66AFB  311622Z /38 </p><p>O 311654Z MAY 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 4010 </p><p>INFO EUROPEAN POLITICAL COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p>AMCONSUL NAPLES PRIORITY </p><p>AMCONSUL FLORENCE </p><p>AMCONSUL MILAN </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 ROME 002660 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/31/2007 </p><p>TAGS: IT, MW, OPRC, PGOV, SR </p><p>SUBJECT: POSSIBLE ITALIAN INDICTMENT OF MONTENEGRIN </p><p>PRESIDENT </p><p> </p><p>BERLUSCONI\'S GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN LESS INTERESTED THAN ITS </p><p>PREDECESSOR IN CRITICIZING MONTENEGRO. THE ITALIAN MFA HAS </p><p>ALSO TOLD US THAT ALL OF ITS INDICATIONS ARE THAT MONTENEGRO </p><p>IS NO LONGER A MAIN SOURCE OF CIGARETTES SMUGGLED INTO </p><p>ITALY.)  TO ALL OF THESE COMMENTS, POLMC REPLIED THAT THERE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  02660  02 OF 02  311622Z </p><p>IS NO REASON TO BELIEVE THAT SCELSI HAD ANY REASON TO BE </p><p>INFLUENCED BY "ANTI-MONTENEGRIN CIRCLES" OR TO HAVE A </p><p>POSITION ON THE FEDERAL RELATIONS BETWEEN SERBIA AND </p><p>MONTENEGRO. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) COMMENT: IT\'S TO BE EXPECTED THAT MANY MONTENEGRINS, </p><p>AND NOT A FEW ITALIAN NEWSPAPERS, WOULD SEEK A HIDDEN </p><p>SIGNIFICANCE IN THE EXACT TIMING OF THIS NEWS.  IT IS ALSO </p><p>UNDERSTANDABLE THAT DJUKANOVIC SUPPORTERS (AND EVEN HIS </p><p>DETRACTORS) WOULD SEEK TO EXPLAIN THE MOVE AS A POLITICAL </p><p>MEASURE RELATED TO ITALY\'S DETERMINATION TO KEEP MONTENEGRO </p><p>WITHIN YUGOSLAVIA.  BUT IT JUST AIN\'T TRUE.  ITALY\'S </p><p>PROSECUTORS, AS WE\'VE REPORTED PREVIOUSLY, ARE EVEN MORE </p><p>AUTONOMOUS THAN THEIR US COUNTERPARTS; THEY LITERALLY ANSWER </p><p>TO NO ONE.  THE INABILITY OF THE GOVERNMENT TO INFLUENCE HOW </p><p>AND WHO THE PROSECUTORS CHOOSE TO INVESTIGATE HAS BEEN A </p><p>CONSTANT ANNOYANCE TO PRIME MINISTER BERLUSCONI, WHO HAS </p><p>FACED A SERIES OF INVESTIGATIONS, INICTMENTS AND TRIALS </p><p>LASTING RIGHT UP TO TODAY.  ECAUSE OF ITS HISTORY, ITALY HAS </p><p>GIVEN THE SPECIL ANTI-MAFIA PROSECUTORS EVEN MORE PROCEDURAL </p><p>LEEWAY IN INVESTIGATION AND PROSECUTION OF ORGANIZED CRIME </p><p>ACTIVITY.  NOR IS IT LIKELY THAT A FIGURE NOW IN THE </p><p>OPPOSITION (DINI OR DEL TURCO) WOULD HAVE A MOTIVE (LINGERING </p><p>SYMPATHY FOR MILOSEVIC?!) TO TAKE THE RISK OF PUSHING THE </p><p>PROSECUTOR TO GO PUBLIC.  ONE TYPE OF POLITICAL MOTIVE CANNOT </p><p>BE RULED OUT: THE AMBITION OF A PROSECUTOR TO MAKE A NAME FOR </p><p>HIMSELF.  EVEN WITH THAT POSSIBILITY, THIS CASE IS VERY MUCH </p><p>WHAT IT APPEARS TO BE: A COMPLEX, LONG-TERM, ANTI-MAFIA </p><p>INVESTIGATION MOVING GRADUALLY UPWARD FROM LOWER TO HIGHER </p><p>LEVEL.  END COMMENT </p><p>DEAN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  02660  02 OF 02  311622Z </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME02660 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
