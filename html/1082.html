<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 03 COLOMBO 000968 </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR SUTPHIN </p><p>CINCPAC FOR FPA TWINING </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/07/10 </p><p>TAGS: MOPS, PREL, CE </p><p>SUBJECT: LTTE OFFERS TEMPORARY CEASE-FIRE </p><p> </p><p>(U) CLASSIFIED BY:  RICHARD H. SMYTH, DCM.  REASON(S): </p><p>1.5(D), (E). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY.  WITH THE SRI LANKAN ARMY HAVING PULLED </p><p>BACK TO NEW DEFENSIVE LINES AND A SLOWDOWN IN LTTE </p><p>ADVANCES OVER THE WEEKEND ON THE JAFFNA FRONT, THE LTTE </p><p>HAS OFFERED A TEMPORARY CEASE-FIRE TO ALLOW GSL FORCES </p><p>TO "WITHDRAW FROM THE UNFAVORABLE THEATER OF WAR WITH </p><p>DIGNITY AND HONOR." THE OFFER PRESENTS THE GSL WITH A </p><p>NUMBER OF DILEMMAS AND MANY UNANSWERED QUESTIONS; </p><p>GOVERNMENT SOURCES ARE SAYING THAT THEY ARE "STUDYING </p><p>THE OFFER."  COUNTRIES ABLE TO ASSIST IN AN EVACUATION, </p><p>IF ASKED, ARE GOING TO HAVE TO CAREFULLY EVALUATE THE </p><p>RELATIVE PERMISSIVENESS OF THE LTTE OFFER. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>LTTE PRESS RELEASE </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) AT 0935(L), THE LTTE OFFICE IN LONDON ISSUED THE </p><p>FOLLOWING PRESS RELEASE: </p><p> </p><p>BEGIN QUOTE: </p><p> </p><p>"THE LIBERATION TIGERS OF TAMIL EELAM (LTTE) WISHES TO </p><p>STATE THAT IT IS PREPARED TO DECLARE A TEMPORARY CEASE- </p><p>FIRE SUSPENDING ALL ARMED HOSTILITIES AGAINST THE SRI </p><p>LANKAN ARMED FORCES TO FACILITATE THE BELEAGUERED </p><p>GOVERNMENT TROOPS TO BE EVACUATED SAFELY FROM THE JAFFNA </p><p>PENINSULA. </p><p> </p><p>"OUR PROPOSED CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES WILL COME INTO </p><p>EFFECT AS SOON AS THE SRI LANKA GOVERNMENT INDICATES TO </p><p>US, WITHOUT DELAY, ITS WILLINGNESS TO OBSERVE THE SAME. </p><p>WE CALL UPON THE INTERNATIONAL COMMITTEE OF THE RED </p><p>CROSS TO SUPERVISE AND ASSIST THE ORDERLY EVACUATION OF </p><p>TROOPS. </p><p> </p><p>"THE LEADERSHIP OF THE LIBERATION TIGERS HAS MADE THIS </p><p>DECISION AS A GESTURE OF GOODWILL TO PREVENT ESCALATION </p><p>OF VIOLENCE AND BLOODBATH AND TO CREATE A CONGENIAL </p><p>ENVIRONMENT FOR SRI LANKAN SOLDIERS TO WITHDRAW FROM THE </p><p>UNFAVORABLE THEATER OF WAR WITH DIGNITY AND HONOR. </p><p> </p><p>"WE CALL UPON THE GOVERNMENT OF SRI LANKA TO CONSIDER </p><p>OUR PROPOSAL SERIOUSLY AND RESPOND POSITIVELY WITHOUT </p><p>DELAY.  A POSITIVE RESPONSE, WE ARE CONFIDENT, WILL </p><p>CREATE CORDIAL CONDITIONS FOR A PERMANENT CEASE-FIRE, </p><p>PEACE, TALKS, AND NEGOTIATED POLITICAL SETTLEMENT FOR </p><p>THE TAMIL NATIONAL QUESTION.  WE ALSO WISH TO INDICATE </p><p>TO THE SRI LANKA GOVERNMENT THAT IT WILL BEAR TOTAL </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE DISASTROUS CONSEQUENCES OF HEAVY </p><p>MILITARY CASUALTIES IF IT REJECTS OUR PROPOSAL FOR DE- </p><p>ESCALATION AND CONTINUES THE WAR EFFORT." </p><p> </p><p>END QUOTE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CONTEXT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) THE MEASURED TONES OF THE STATEMENT -- </p><p>PARTICULARLY THE EMPHASIS ON AVOIDING A BLOOD-BATH AND </p><p>HOLDING OUT THE PROSPECT OF THE CEASE-FIRE BEING A </p><p>PRECURSOR TO A NEGOTIATED SETTLEMENT TO THE "TAMIL </p><p>NATIONAL QUESTION" (WITHOUT SPECIFICALLY MENTIONING </p><p>INDEPENDENCE) -- SHOULD PLAY WELL WITH THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>COMMUNITY, ESPECIALLY INDIA, AS IT WRESTLES WITH </p><p>IDENTIFYING APPROPRIATE RESPONSES TO THE JAFFNA </p><p>OFFENSIVE. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) THE OFFER COMES AFTER INDIA HAS REJECTED ARMED </p><p>INTERVENTION AND AS THE JAFFNA BATTLELINES HAVE BECOME </p><p>RELATIVELY STABILIZED, WITH GSL FORCES ESTABLISHING A </p><p>MAIN DEFENSIVE LINE RUNNING SOUTH-SOUTHWESTWARDS FROM </p><p>POINT PEDRO TO THE JAFFNA LAGOON.  WEEKEND REPORTS OF </p><p>COMBAT SUGGESTED LOW- TO MODERATE INTENSITY MORTAR/ </p><p>ARTILLERY EXCHANGES RATHER THAN INFANTRY OPERATIONS. </p><p>BOTH GOVERNMENT AND LTTE FORCES NEED A BREATHER;  WITH </p><p>ITS RECENTLY ACQUIRED HEAVY ARTILLERY, HOWEVER, THE LTTE </p><p>COULD INTENSIFY ITS OFFENSIVE AGAINST LARGELY </p><p>DEMORALIZED GSL FORCES AFTER A RELATIVELY SHORT BREAK. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>QUESTIONS AND DILEMMAS </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) THE LTTE STATEMENT DOES NOT ADDRESS CERTAIN </p><p>ISSUES ESSENTIAL FOR THE GSL\'S FULL CONSIDERATION OF THE </p><p>OFFER -- AND THEREIN LIES MANY OF THE GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>DILEMMAS.  THE STATEMENT DOES NOT INDICATE WHETHER A </p><p>PERMISSIVE WITHDRAWAL WOULD INCLUDE ARMS AND EQUIPMENT, </p><p>NOR IS ANY TIME-LINE OTHER THAN "SOON" INDICATED. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) WHILE THE GSL COULD CONTINUE TO HOLD OUT IN </p><p>JAFFNA FOR SOME TIME, THE FORCES\' SITUATION IS UNTENABLE </p><p>UNLESS SOME IMAGINATION AND FORCEFULNESS IS DEMONSTRATED </p><p>AND THE INITIATIVE REGAINED, A SCENARIO UNLIKELY OVER </p><p>THE SHORT TERM.  WHILE IT MIGHT MAKE SOUND MILITARY </p><p>SENSE TO HAVE THE ARMY \'LIVE TO FIGHT ANOTHER DAY,\' </p><p>DOMESTIC POLITICAL ISSUES WOULD ARGUE FOR PRESIDENT </p><p>KUMARATUNGA NOT TO GO DOWN IN HISTORY AS THE LEADER THAT </p><p>CAPITULATED -- EVEN IN A WITHDRAWAL "WITH HONOR" -- TO </p><p>THE LTTE. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) THE VAGUENESS OF THE LTTE STATEMENT ARGUES </p><p>AGAINST THE GSL\'S IMMEDIATE ACCEPTANCE OF THE OFFER -- </p><p>BUT EVEN A STATEMENT INDICATING MORE INFORMATION IS </p><p>NECESSARY WOULD SIGNAL A WAVERING (WITH ITS POLITICAL </p><p>COST) IN THE GOVERNMENT\'S RESOLVE TO HOLD JAFFNA, THE </p><p>ONE GREAT MILITARY PRIZE OF KUMARATUNGA\'S GOVERNMENT. </p><p>SHOULD THE GOVERNMENT DECIDE TO SEEK ADDITIONAL </p><p>INFORMATION, LTTE CONDITIONS COULD PROVE SO TOTALLY </p><p>UNACCEPTABLE (TOO SHORT A TIME FRAME, PREEMPTIVE </p><p>DISARMING OF GOVERNMENT FORCES, ETC.) THAT A CEASE-FIRE </p><p>WOULD PROVE IMPOSSIBLE, LEAVING THE LTTE ON THE FIELD AS </p><p>THE PARTY THAT MAGNANIMOUSLY OFFERED PEACE ONLY TO BE </p><p>REJECTED.  PERHAPS THE GREATEST DILEMMA OF ALL IS IF THE </p><p>GSL ACCEPTED THE CEASE-FIRE IN PRINCIPLE, BUT COULD NOT </p><p>ARRANGE FOR TRANSPORTATION; SRI LANKAN SHIPPING ASSETS </p><p>ALONE ARE INADEQUATE TO SUPPORT OF A TIMELY WITHDRAWAL </p><p>OF ITS TROOPS. </p><p> </p><p>REACTIONS </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (S) IN RESPONSE TO THE BARRAGE OF QUESTIONS FROM THE </p><p>PRESS, GOVERNMENT SOURCES ARE PUBLICLY SAYING THAT THE </p><p>"OFFER MUST BE STUDIED." ACCORDING TO DATT SOURCES, THE </p><p>SRI LANKAN MILITARY LEADERSHIP\'S REACTION AS OF LATE </p><p>AFTERNOON CAN BE PARAPHRASED AS "NUTS." </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) THE ICRC DELEGATION IN COLOMBO SAYS IT IS </p><p>DELIGHTED WITH THE LTTE\'S OFFER, WHILE DISTURBED BY THE </p><p>SANGUINARY LAST SENTENCE.  THEY HAD RECEIVED NO PRIOR </p><p>NOTIFICATION OF THE LTTE\'S OFFER, AND, IN FACT, SAY THEY </p><p>HAVE HAD NO DIRECT CONTACT WITH THE LTTE REGARDING THE </p><p>POSSIBILITY AND MODALITIES OF ICRC OVERSIGHT OF A </p><p>MILITARY EVACUATION.  THEIR IMMEDIATE PLANS ARE TO DO </p><p>NOTHING, BUT WAIT AND SEE IF THE GSL AND/OR LTTE COME </p><p>DIRECTLY TO THEM WITH A REQUEST TO PLAY AN INTERMEDIARY </p><p>ROLE. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) NORWEGIAN AMBASSADOR WESTBORG WAS UNAWARE OF THE </p><p>LTTE PRESS RELEASE WHEN AMBASSADOR SPOKE WITH HIM BY </p><p>PHONE LATE THIS AFTERNOON.  WESTBORG\'S IMMEDIATE </p><p>REACTION TO THE NEWS WAS THAT IT COULD REPEAT COULD </p><p>PROVIDE AN OPENING FOR TALKS BUT HE HAD MANY QUESTIONS. </p><p>IF THE LTTE CONSULTED WITH GON REPS IN LONDON OR OSLO ON </p><p>THIS CALL FOR A CEASE-FIRE AND NEGOTIATIONS, NORWAYS MAN </p><p>IN COLOMBO WAS LEFT OUT OF THE LOOP. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) WHETHER THE LTTE OFFER IS SERIOUS OR NOT (AND </p><p>HERE WE AGAIN NOTE THAT THE LTTE SET THE OFFER UP IN A </p><p>MANNER ALLOWING EASY WITHDRAWAL OF THE RUG), THE </p><p>ORGANIZATION HAS ALREADY SCORED SOME REAL PSYOPS POINTS </p><p>WITH THE TROOPS UNDER THREAT IN JAFFNA AND POTENTIALLY </p><p>WITH ELEMENTS OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY HOPING FOR </p><p>A SUSTAINABLE PEACE IN SRI LANKA. </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) WHETHER THE GSL REJECTS OR ACCEPTS THE OFFER -- </p><p>AND WE BELIEVE A REJECTION IS MOST LIKELY -- THE OFFER </p><p>ITSELF AND THE GOVERNMENT\'S RESPONSE WILL LIKELY FIGURE </p><p>HEAVILY IN THE EXTENDED DEFENSE DEBATE SCHEDULED TO </p><p>BEGIN IN PARLIAMENT TOMORROW AS WELL AS IN THE </p><p>DELIBERATIONS OF THE OTHER COUNTRIES THAT SRI LANKA HAS </p><p>APPROACHED FOR ONE KIND OR ANOTHER OF ASSISTANCE. </p><p> </p><p>DONNELLY </p><p></p></div>
