<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 001479 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR SA/INS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 8/12/12 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINS, PINR, CE, Political Parties </p><p>SUBJECT:  Amidst vehement rhetoric, President leaves </p><p>door open for cohabitation negotiations </p><p> </p><p>REF:  (A) FBIS Reston VA dtg 120351Z Aug 02 </p><p> </p><p>-     (B) FBIS Reston VA dtg 100639Z Aug 02 </p><p>-     (C) Colombo 1433 </p><p>-     (D) Colombo 1403 </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador E. Ashley Wills.  Reasons </p><p>1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C)  Summary:  On August 9, the President delivered a </p><p>televised speech to the nation that focused on </p><p>cohabitation with the ruling United National Front (UNF) </p><p>and the peace process.  The President opened her </p><p>national address with conciliatory remarks, but halfway </p><p>through morphed into attack mode, assailing her </p><p>cohabitant - the UNF.  Political observers differ on </p><p>their interpretation of the President\'s present </p><p>position, but overall there is some faint hope that </p><p>cohabitation may yet work.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U)  On the evening of August 9, President </p><p>Kumaratunga addressed the nation on national TV on the </p><p>current peace process and cohabitation with the UNF led </p><p>government.  (Please see Ref B for the full text.)  The </p><p>speech began in conciliatory tones.  To Wit: </p><p> </p><p>--  As Executive President I have the duty to work in </p><p>cohabitation with a Cabinet comprised of a different </p><p>Party. </p><p> </p><p>--  ... the ability to put country before self, become </p><p>essential pre-requisites in the political leadership of </p><p>both sides. </p><p> </p><p>--  Throughout my political career I have remained </p><p>resolute that the ethnic issue requires a political </p><p>settlement.  Accordingly, I have extended my fullest </p><p>support to the peace process. </p><p> </p><p>--  I am not prepared to aggravate the state of </p><p>political confusion prevailing today by holding another </p><p>election. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  After this promising beginning, the President </p><p>changed moods mid-speech.  She referred to the UNF\'s </p><p>"mockery of democracy."  She repeatedly insinuated that </p><p>the PM was naive in his handling of the peace process. </p><p>And she threatened to use her presidential powers to </p><p>prevent the dismemberment of the state, implying that </p><p>the PM was prepared to consider breaking Sri Lanka apart </p><p>if not for her steadfastness.  In a happy conclusion, </p><p>she stated she would continue to support the peace </p><p>process for the good of the country. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Just as the President\'s speech delivered two </p><p>distinct and opposing messages, reactions to it have </p><p>been divided.  Harim Peiris, the Presidential Spokesman, </p><p>stated that the primary message that Kumaratunga was </p><p>trying to relay in the speech was conciliatory.  The </p><p>President, he asserted, is willing to work with the UNF, </p><p>as long as the UNF accepts that she will not give up her </p><p>presidential powers piece-by-piece.  Kumaratunga, like </p><p>the UNF, believes the Executive Presidency should be </p><p>abolished, but - unlike the UNF - only as part of a </p><p>comprehensive change in the constitution.  Peiris </p><p>stressed that the President has no intention of </p><p>dissolving Parliament and that she believes cohabitation </p><p>will work if the UNF is willing to let it work along </p><p>current constitutional lines.  (Note:  Kumaratunga\'s </p><p>office is planning to release a statement emphasizing </p><p>these two points later this evening.) </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Our soundings around town otherwise were mixed. </p><p>The Center for Policy Alternatives\' Kethesh Loganathan </p><p>commented that the conciliatory part of the speech was </p><p>the political message that Kumaratunga was delivering </p><p>and, in the end, is the rational choice she will take. </p><p>He added that the more aggressive statements were merely </p><p>her venting some personal frustration.  He believes the </p><p>UNF will have to mollify Kumaratunga in some manner and </p><p>that it can and will be done. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C)  MP R. Sampanthan of the Tamil National Alliance </p><p>stated that if CBK uses her presidential powers as </p><p>threatened in her speech the government will not be able </p><p>to function.  M.C.M. Iqbal of the Law and Society Trust, </p><p>normally neutral on the President, does not believe her </p><p>promises of cohabitation and will not believe them until </p><p>she accepts a constitutional change. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C)  Comment:  The President\'s address to the nation </p><p>was not a bracing splash of conciliation and optimism. </p><p>It was equivocal and general enough, however, to leave </p><p>hope that reconciliation is possible.  In this </p><p>connection, we understand the PM and President will be </p><p>meeting August 12 or 13 to try to come to terms on a </p><p>more peaceful coexistence and cooperation.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
