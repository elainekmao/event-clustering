<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 002708 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR DRL, AF/W AND AF/RA </p><p>AF/W FOR PARKS, EPSTEIN </p><p>DRL FOR TOMLYANOVICH </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/24/2006 </p><p>TAGS: PINS, PREF, PGOV, PHUM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: REPORTS OF ARMY ATTACKS ON TIV IN BENUE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter, reasons 1.5 (b) and </p><p>(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> 1. (U)  Summary: According to several sources, the Army is </p><p>reported to have destroyed several villages in Eastern Benue </p><p>and killed an undetermined number of people in an apparent </p><p>reprisal for the murder of nineteen soldiers October 12. </p><p>Troops apparently destroyed the house of former Chief of Army </p><p>staff Victor Malu, killing several family members.  In </p><p>apparent response to the military action, a demonstration by </p><p>Tiv students at the University of Makurdi turned violent when </p><p>the students attacked a police station in the city. </p><p>Eyewitnesses report at least ten killed in that incident, </p><p>which was eventually quelled by the police.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  A number of private and public sources are reporting </p><p>these events.  We cannot now state that these reports are </p><p>completely true.  However, that we are getting similar </p><p>renditions from a variety of independent sources lends </p><p>credibility to the general account of events.  A picture is </p><p>emerging that indicates multiple military actions against </p><p>civilians in Benue State, resulting in the destruction of </p><p>several villages and the deaths of over 100 people. </p><p>Eyewitnesses who fled the destruction, as well as Tiv </p><p>leaders, have reported to BHC and Embassy officials that Army </p><p>units entering Benue from Taraba state on Monday evening, </p><p>began targeting ethnic Tiv villages.  The informal Tiv </p><p>militia have been accused of the October 12 killings of Army </p><p>soldiers in Benue.  Troops are reported to have killed </p><p>residents of Gbeji, and Vaase, villages in the Ukum Local </p><p>Government Area in eastern Benue, before razing them.  After </p><p>destroying the village of Anyiin, troops went to  Zaki-Biam, </p><p>where they levelled former Chief of Army Staff Victor Malu\'s </p><p>residence, allegedly killing his grandmother and five other </p><p>members of his household in the process.  A high ranking </p><p>military officer denied that Army troops have killed anyone </p><p>in Benue State, and said there were other security forces </p><p>(SSS, informal militia) which may be responsible for any </p><p>deaths (see DAO septel). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  Tivs have flooded into Makurdi from the affected </p><p>areas, adding to nearly 60,000 co-ethnics who were previously </p><p>displaced from their homes in neighboring Nasarawa and Taraba </p><p>states.  In reaction to the killings, students at the </p><p>predominantly Tiv University of Makurdi staged a </p><p>demonstration which generated a riot when students attacked a </p><p>police station, according to a BHC source with direct access. </p><p> The police responded with tear gas and fired weapons above </p><p>the students\' heads.  One Amcit eyewitness reported seeing at </p><p>least 10 charred bodies after the demonstration was over.  It </p><p>is not clear whether the bodies were police, students or </p><p>both. </p><p>---------- </p><p>Background </p><p>---------- </p><p>4. (C)  The nineteen soldiers were reportedly kidnapped and </p><p>killed by an armed band of Tiv youth, who dismembered and </p><p>severely mutilated the soldiers\' bodies.  The soldiers had </p><p>been deployed to the border area to maintain order between </p><p>feuding Tiv and Jukun ethnic groups.  Senator Daniel J. </p><p>Saror, and Representative Gabriel Suswam, both Tivs who </p><p>represent the area affected by the military action, met </p><p>Ambassador Jeter October 24 to present their perspective and </p><p>to request USG assistance in stopping the violence assisting </p><p>what they claim may be over 500,000 internally displaced </p><p>persons.  Both men claimed that the October 12 deaths were </p><p>the result of a battle of Tiv militia against soldiers and </p><p>Jukun militia wearing army uniforms who had burned a Tiv </p><p>village.  The Tiv militia prevailed in the ensuing firefight, </p><p>killing the soldiers and Jukun militia members.  It was </p><p>widely reported in the press that the President and the Army </p><p>had called upon Tiv leaders to "turn over" the perpetrators </p><p>or face a possible military action. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  The capture and murder of these soldiers was the </p><p>latest incident in a series of conflicts involving the Tiv </p><p>and their ethnic neighbors in Nasarawa, Benue and Taraba </p><p>states.  According to the Nigerian ethnic calculus of the </p><p>indigene/settler, Tivs are regarded as interlopers by the </p><p>"indigenous" ethnic groups in Nasarawa and Taraba, even </p><p>though they migrated into central Nigeria many years ago and </p><p>are the largest ethnic group in Benue State.  Disputes over </p><p>land and access to state resources break out with some </p><p>frequency; there is an historical record of Tiv/Jukun </p><p>disputes that spans most of the 20th Century.   The current </p><p>cycle began in southeastern Nasarawa state June 12 when an </p><p>Azara chieftan was assassinated, purportedly by a group of </p><p>local Tiv (Reftel).  The Azara are allies of the Jukun, at </p><p>least when it comes to resisting Tiv "encroachment." </p><p>Hundreds may have been killed in the ensuing conflict, which </p><p>was eventually stopped by the military, with nearly 30,000 </p><p>Tiv migrating south to Benue State.  Later in July, the </p><p>conflict spread to Taraba State, where members of the Jukun </p><p>ethnic group allegedly attacked local Tiv, driving them into </p><p>Benue state.  Twenty-five people were reported killed in that </p><p>attack and 25,000 Tiv fled Taraba for camps on Benue and </p><p>Nasarawa. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C)  Comment: Most disconcerting are the reports of the </p><p>Army\'s lethal brutality.  If true, this will stain the Army </p><p>and the Federal Government as severely as did the 1999 Odi </p><p>massacre.  Tiv leaders allege that their people are de facto </p><p>being expelled from Nasarawa and Taraba--what they call </p><p>ethnic cleansing--even though Tiv have resided there for </p><p>nearly two centuries.  We have no evidence of a conscious </p><p>plot to expel the Tiv, and certainly have no evidence that </p><p>the Nasarawa and Taraba state governments are involved. </p><p>However, the two state governments have done little to halt </p><p>this Tiv displacement.  Still, this conflict cannot be as one </p><p>sided as the Tiv leadership represents.  The Tiv allege that </p><p>the Army has sided with the Jukun, and that Minister of </p><p>Defense Danjuma (ethnically a Tiv but raised as a Jukun) has </p><p>provided the Jukun militia with arms.  The Jukun allege that </p><p>General Malu is doing the same for the Tiv.  We cannot </p><p>confirm these assertions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C)  Comment cntd.: That General Malu (an ethnic Tiv) may </p><p>have been targeted by his former troops adds another twist to </p><p>this tragedy.  General Malu, the author of the Odi massacre, </p><p>may not be expected to take this passively, and violence in </p><p>Benue, as well as a looming humanitarian disaster, is likely </p><p>to continue.  End Comment. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
