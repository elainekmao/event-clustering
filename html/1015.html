<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 PRETORIA 012830 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL:  10/21/99 </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, MASS, SF </p><p>SUBJECT:  SOUTH AFRICA AND SADC\'S SECURITY ORGAN </p><p> </p><p>(U) CLASSIFIED BY POLCOUNS MDRAGSDALE, REASONS 1.5(B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  SUMMARY.  SOUTH AFRICAN DEFENSE AND FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTERS WILL TAKE PART IN AN OCTOBER 26 - 27 SPECIAL </p><p>MINISTERIAL SESSION IN SWAZILAND ON REFORM OF THE ORGAN ON </p><p>POLITICS, DEFENSE, AND SECURITY (THE ORGAN).  PARTICIPATION </p><p>OF THE FOREIGN MINISTER SHOULD ADDRESS SAG CONCERN THAT ANY </p><p>DECISIONS MADE ON THE ISSUE HAVE THE BLESSING OF THE SADC </p><p>COUNCIL OF MINISTERS.  THE MINISTERIAL FOLLOWS ON THE HEELS </p><p>OF A SUCCESSFUL WORKING SESSION IN PRETORIA THE WEEK OF </p><p>SEPTEMBER 27 - OCTOBER 1 ORGANIZED BY THE SOUTH AFRICAN, </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN, AND SWAZI MINISTERS OF DEFENSE.  THE MOST </p><p>SUCCESSFUL ELEMENT OF THE WORKING SESSION WAS ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>COMPREHENSION (FINALLY) OF THE SAG\'S POSITION THAT THE </p><p>ORGAN MUST BE INTEGRATED INTO THE OVERALL SADC STRUCTURE. </p><p>STRESSING THAT SADC MEMBERS SOMETIMES VIEW SWAZILAND AS A </p><p>SOUTH AFRICAN "SATELLITE," THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR SADC </p><p>POLITICAL AFFAIRS TOLD POLOFF ON OCTOBER 7 THAT ANY </p><p>DECISION ON ORGAN REFORM NEEDED TO APPEAR TO BE A WIDER </p><p>INITIATIVE THAN THAT OF SOUTH AFRICA, ZIMBABWE, AND </p><p>SWAZILAND.  ALTHOUGH THE SAG REMAINS WORRIED THAT ZIMBABWE </p><p>WILL IN THE END BALK AT FULL ORGAN-SADC INTEGRATION, SOUTH </p><p>AFRICA IS NONETHELESS GOING TO SWAZILAND WITH THE HOPE THAT </p><p>THE SPECIAL MINISTERIAL WILL RESULT IN SADC ENDORSEMENT FOR </p><p>ORGAN REFORM.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>BACKGROUND ON SADC AND THE SECURITY ORGAN </p><p>========================================= </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  BEFORE SADC CAN ADDRESS REGIONAL SECURITY ISSUES </p><p>IN AN ORGANIZED FASHION, MEMBER STATES MUST FIRST AGREE ON </p><p>SADC\'S ROLE WITH REGARD TO POLITICAL, DEFENSE, AND SECURITY </p><p>ISSUES.  FOR THAT TO TAKE PLACE, THE STATUS OF SADC\'S </p><p>ORGAN, (AS WELL AS THE INTERSTATE DEFENSE AND SECURITY </p><p>COMMITTEE (ISDSC)) MUST BE CLEARLY DEFINED.  ALTHOUGH </p><p>MEMBER STATES ACCEPTED THE IDEA OF THE ORGAN DURING THE </p><p>SADC HEADS OF STATE SUMMIT IN MASERU IN 1996, THE ORGAN IS </p><p>MAINTAINED SEPARATELY AT THE HEADS OF STATE LEVEL.  ITS </p><p>CHAIR, ZIMBABWEAN PRESIDENT MUGABE, VIEWS THE ORGAN AS A </p><p>PARALLEL AND EQUAL BODY NEITHER DIRECTLY LINKED NOR </p><p>ACCOUNTABLE TO SADC OR THE ISDSC.  HOWEVER, UNLIKE SADC, </p><p>NEITHER THE ORGAN NOR THE ISDSC (WHICH IS CHAIRED BY </p><p>SWAZILAND) POSSESS SECRETARIATS, WHICH HAS LIMITED BOTH </p><p>BODIES\' POTENTIAL SCOPE OF ACTION. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  ALTHOUGH THE ORGAN CHAIRMANSHIP IS ONLY A ONE-YEAR </p><p>TERM, SUCCESSION HAS BEEN HELD UP OVER DIFFERENCES ABOUT </p><p>ITS RELATIONSHIP TO SADC.  PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF DIFFERENCES </p><p>BETWEEN SADC\'S PREVIOUS CHAIR, FORMER SOUTH AFRICAN </p><p>PRESIDENT MANDELA AND MUGABE, DISCUSSION ON THE ORGAN\'S </p><p>STRUCTURE HAS BEEN CONTINUALLY SIDELINED.  ALTHOUGH SADC </p><p>TASKED A WORKING GROUP, COMPRISED OF MOZAMBIQUE, MALAWI, </p><p>AND NAMIBIA, IN EARLY 1998 TO STUDY THE ISSUE, NEITHER THE </p><p>ISSUE NOR THE GROUP\'S RECOMMENDATION WERE EVEN ADDRESSED AT </p><p>THE 1998 SADC SUMMIT IN MAURITIUS.  HOWEVER, DURING THE </p><p>1999 SUMMIT IN MAPUTO (WHERE SOUTH AFRICA PASSED ON THE </p><p>SADC CHAIRMANSHIP TO MOZAMBIQUE AND THEREBY REMOVED THE </p><p>PERSONAL TENSION BETWEEN MANDELA AND MUGABE FROM THE </p><p>EQUATION), DISCUSSION WAS RE-OPENED AND A COMMITMENT WAS </p><p>MADE TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE, RESULTING IN THIS RECENT ROUND </p><p>OF SOUTH AFRICAN, ZIMBABWEAN, AND SWAZI MEETINGS. </p><p> </p><p>FROM MINISTERS TO WORKING GROUP </p><p>=============================== </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  IN AN OCTOBER 7 MEETING, DEPARTMENT OF FOREIGN </p><p>AFFAIRS\' (DFA) DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR SADC POLITICAL AFFAIRS </p><p>HORST BRAMMER TOLD POLOFF THAT HE HAD BEEN UNEXPECTEDLY (HE </p><p>WAS SCHEDULED FOR ANNUAL LEAVE) DRAFTED THE WEEK OF </p><p>SEPTEMBER 27 - OCTOBER 1 TO MEET WITH ZIMBABWEAN AND SWAZI </p><p>COUNTERPARTS ON THE ISSUE OF REFORM OF THE ORGAN FOR </p><p>POLITICS, DEFENSE, AND SECURITY.  THE WEEK-LONG </p><p>"BRAINSTORMING" SESSION CONSISTED OF 2-PERSON DELEGATIONS </p><p>(ONE FOREIGN MINISTRY OFFICIAL AND ONE DEFENSE MINISTRY </p><p>OFFICIAL) FROM EACH OF THE THREE COUNTRIES.  ACCORDING TO </p><p>BRAMMER, THIS UNEXPECTED WORKING SESSION CAME ABOUT AS A </p><p>DIRECT RESULT OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN, ZIMBABWEAN, AND SWAZI </p><p>DEFENSE MINISTERS\' MEETINGS IN PRETORIA THE WEEK BEFORE </p><p>(THE WEEK OF SEPTEMBER 21).  ALTHOUGH BRAMMER WELCOMED THE </p><p>INITIATIVE AND NOTED THAT INITIAL AGREEMENT HAD BEEN </p><p>REACHED ON NEXT STEPS, HE NONETHELESS WORRIED THAT THE </p><p>DEFENSE MINISTERS WERE CIRCUMVENTING THE SADC STRUCTURE IN </p><p>THEIR QUEST FOR RESOLUTION OF THE ISSUE. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  AS BRAMMER EXPLAINED, PERMITTING MINISTERS OF </p><p>DEFENSE TO DECIDE ON SADC ISSUES WITHOUT FIRST COORDINATING </p><p>WITH THE SADC COUNCIL OF MINISTERS CREATED A "PROBLEM OF </p><p>PRINCIPLES."  CITING THE EXAMPLES OF SOUTH AFRICAN </p><p>INTERVENTION IN LESOTHO AND ZIMBABWEAN, ANGOLAN, AND </p><p>NAMIBIAN INTERVENTION IN THE DROC (NOMINALLY IN SADC\'S </p><p>NAME), BRAMMMER STRESSED THAT ALLOWING THE MINISTERS OF </p><p>DEFENSE TO "SOLVE" THE ORGAN PROBLEM ADDED TO THE OVERALL </p><p>WEAKENING OF SADC LEGITIMACY.  THEREFORE, BRAMMER </p><p>EMPHASIZED THAT THE SAG WOULD INSIST THAT ANY FOLLOW-ON </p><p>MEETINGS BE INCLUSIVE AND ANY MINISTERIALS ADDRESSING THE </p><p>ISSUE INCLUDE FOREIGN MINISTERS.  (COMMENT.  IN AN OCTOBER </p><p>21 CONVERSATION, BRAMMER APPEARED SATISFIED THAT THE </p><p>OCTOBER 26 - 27 MINISTERIAL WILL MEET THESE REQUIREMENTS. </p><p>END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ZIMBABWE SEES THE LIGHT </p><p>======================= </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  WITH GREAT RELIEF, BRAMMER NOTED THAT HARARE HAS </p><p>FINALLY BEGUN TO "UNDERSTAND" THE SOUTH AFRICA POSITION ON </p><p>THE ORGAN ISSUE.  LAMENTING THE FACT THAT ZIMBABWE HAD </p><p>PERMITTED THE ORGAN ISSUE TO BECOME A PERSONAL ONE (ON THE </p><p>SIDE OF PRESIDENT MUGABE), BRAMMER STRESSED THAT THE SAG </p><p>HAS FINALLY BEEN ABLE TO CONVINCE AT LEAST THE ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>DEFENSE MINISTER THAT SOUTH AFRICA DID NOT WANT TO TAKE </p><p>OVER THE ORGAN, ONLY ENSURE ITS INTEGRATION INTO THE </p><p>OVERALL SADC STRUCTURE.  ACCORDING TO BRAMMER, THE </p><p>ZIMBABWEANS NOW HAVE A CLEARER IDEA AS TO THE IMPORTANCE OF </p><p>ORGAN INTEGRATION.  RECALLING THAT THE SAG HAD USED THREE </p><p>KEY POINTS TO CONVINCE THE ZIMBABWEANS OF THIS, BRAMMER </p><p>INDICATED THAT THE ZIMBABWEANS FOUND THE KEY POINT OF </p><p>INTERNATIONAL RECOGNITION THE MOST COMPELLING (COMMENT. </p><p>THE SAG HAS STRESSED REPEATEDLY THAT THE ORGAN MUST BE PART </p><p>OF SADC OR ELSE IT WOULD NOT QUALIFY AS AN ACTOR IN </p><p>INTERNATIONAL MANDATES, SUCH AS UN CHAPTER 6 0R 7 ACTION. </p><p>END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  BRAMMER ADDED THAT ONE OF THE SAG\'S OTHER TWO </p><p>POINTS HAD BEEN THAT SOUTHERN AFRICAN POLITICAL ISSUES ARE </p><p>INTRICATELY TIED TO SADC ECONOMIC ONES (I.E., RESOURCE </p><p>CONFLICT CAUSES POLITICAL INSTABILITY), SO THE ORGAN SHOULD </p><p>BE TIED TO SADC FORMALLY.  LASTLY, THE SAG HAD FOCUSED </p><p>ATTENTION ON ZIMBABWE\'S POCKETS, NOTING THAT THE COST OF </p><p>REPLICATING INSTITUTIONS (I.E., A SECRETARIAT FOR BOTH THE </p><p>ORGAN AND SADC) WOULD BE A WASTE OF ALREADY SCARCE </p><p>MONTETARY RESOURCES.  IN THE END, ACCORDING TO BRAMMER, THE </p><p>ZIMBABWEANS AT THE WEEK-LONG CONFERENCE (AND IMPLICITELY </p><p>THE ZIMBABWEAN MINISTER OF DEFENSE) ACCEPTED ALL THREE </p><p>ARGUMENTS, WHICH SOMEWHAT SURPRISED, BUT CERTAINLY PLEASED, </p><p>THE SOUTH AFRICAN DELEGATION. </p><p> </p><p>BUT WILL ZIMBABWE PLAY BALL? </p><p>============================ </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  ON THE OTHER HAND, BRAMMER TOLD POLOFF THAT EVEN </p><p>DAYS AFTER THIS SUCCESSFUL WORKING COMMITTEE MEETING, </p><p>REPORTS FROM HARARE INDICATED THAT MUGABE WAS BALKING AT </p><p>LENDING FURTHER SUPPORT TO THE DEFENSE MINISTERS\' SCHEME. </p><p>EXPRESSING CONCERN OVER ZIMBABWE\'S COMMITMENT TO REFORM, </p><p>BRAMMER COMPLAINED THAT NOT ONLY ZIMBABWE, BUT INCREASINGLY </p><p>NAMIBIA TOO CONTINUED TO TRY TO DEMONSTRATE THEIR </p><p>INDEPENDENCE FROM SOUTH AFRICA.  (COMMENT.  BRAMMER </p><p>ACCOUNTED FOR NAMIBIA\'S PARTICIPATION IN THE ZIMBABWE- </p><p>ANGOLA-NAMIBIA DEFENSE PACT AS JUST THAT - WINDHOEK\'S SHOW </p><p>OF INDEPENDENCE.  DFA SENTIMENT IS THAT NAMIBIA HAS THE </p><p>RIGHT IDEA, BUT SEEMS TO ALWAYS DEMONSTRATE IT THE WRONG </p><p>WAY.  END COMMENT.)  ACCORDING TO BRAMMER, ZIMBABWE WILL </p><p>CONTINUE TO APPROACH THE ISSUE THROUGH BILATERAL DIALOGUE </p><p>(I.E., LEADER TO LEADER), UNTIL AGREEMENT IS REACHED, AND </p><p>ONLY THEN COMMIT TO LARGER INITIATIVES (I.E., SADC REFORM </p><p>OF THE ORGAN).  BRAMMER STRESSED, HOWEVER, THAT IF THE </p><p>MAJORITY OF SADC STATES SUPPORT THE ORGAN\'S INTEGRATION </p><p>INTO SADC (FOR WHICH THE SAG IS KEENLY LOBBYING), IN THE </p><p>END, ZIMBABWE WOULD HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO AGREE </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>======= </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  FOREIGN MINISTER ZUMA WILL ARRIVE IN SWAZILAND </p><p>WELL-BRIEFED ON THE ORGAN ISSUE (DFA OFFICIALS BRIEFED HER </p><p>OVER A THREE-DAY PERIOD IN CAPE TOWN EARLIER THIS WEEK). </p><p>THE SAG, AWARE THAT MUCH OF MUGABE\'S APPARENT COOPERATION </p><p>ON THE ISSUE IS DUE TO HIS CURRENT "RAPPROCHEMENT" WITH </p><p>MBEKI, WILL TRY TO CAPITALIZE ON IT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE, </p><p>AND TRY FOR CONCRETE COMMITMENTS AT THE MINISTERIAL.  AT </p><p>THE SAME TIME, THE SAG WILL SEEK TO ENSURE AT THE </p><p>MINISTERIAL THAT ORGAN REFORM BECOMES AN INCLUSIVE PROJECT </p><p>AND NOT A DEAL STRUCK BY A FEW IN THE BACK ROOM FOR MANY. </p><p>END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>JOSEPH </p><p></p></div>
