<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 BRUSSELS 002939 </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EUR/ERA, S/CT (GRAY), NEA/NGA, NEA/IAI; PASS </p><p>DOJ FOR MRICHARD </p><p>LONDON FOR TUELLER, THE HAGUE FOR MULREAN, LUXEMBOURG FOR </p><p> </p><p>FEIFER, ROME FOR DEMPSEY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/12/08 </p><p>TAGS:  PTER, PREL, EUN, KPAL, IS, PINR </p><p>SUBJECT:  U.S.-EU TROIKA:  TERRORISM </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  CLASSIFIED BY WILLIAM R. REGAN, USEU.  REASON 1.5 </p><p>(B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  THE MAY 7 U.S.-EU TROIKA DISCUSSIONS ON TERRORISM </p><p>COVERED THE WATERFRONT, BUT SPECIAL ATTENTION WAS PAID TO </p><p>THE EU\'S RELATIONS WITH IRAN, WHERE IT PLEDGED CONTINUED </p><p>VIGILANCE, AND ITS COOPERATION PROGRAMS WITH THE </p><p>PALESTINIANS (SEE PARAS 15-17 BELOW).  THERE WAS WIDE </p><p>CONVERGENCE OF VIEWS ON TERRORIST TRENDS, THE RUSSIAN </p><p>PROPOSAL FOR A NUCLEAR TERRORISM CONVENTION, AND THE INDIAN </p><p>MOVE FOR A COMPREHENSIVE TREATY ON TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  THE U.S. WAS REPRESENTED BY S/CT GORDON GRAY, </p><p>DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE REPRESENTATIVE DREW ARENA, AND USEU </p><p>POLOFF BILL REGAN.  VINCENT FEAN, JOINED BY RUPERT JOY AND </p><p>KATE COLLINS, REPRESENTED THE UK PRESIDENCY.  ROUNDING OUT </p><p>THE TROIKA WERE ROBERT ROLLINGER OF LUXEMBOURG AND PETER </p><p>PRAMBERGER, MARINA CHRYSTOPH, PETER BLUMAUER, AND MS. HAMIDI </p><p>OF AUSTRIA.  HENK VAN DER ZWAN REPRESENTED THE COUNCIL </p><p>SECRETARIAT AND MICHEL IPAS AND HANS FEDDERSEN THE EUROPEAN </p><p>COMMISSION. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>U.S.-EU STATEMENT </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  THE EU AGREED TO A JOINT STATEMENT ON SHARED </p><p>OBJECTIVES AND CLOSE COOPERATION IN THE FIELD OF </p><p>COUNTERTERRORISM.  FEAN NOTED THAT EU VIEWED THE STATUS OF </p><p>THE DOCUMENT AS A RESTRICTED WORKING PAPER, THUS NOT FOR </p><p>PUBLIC RELEASE.  IN RESPONSE TO U.S. ARGUMENTS FOR MAKING </p><p>OUR COOPERATION ON TERRORISM PUBLIC, FEAN SAID THAT THE EU </p><p>TROIKA FAVORED A PUBLIC DOCUMENT AND PLEDGED TO WORK WITH </p><p>THE U.S. TO ADDRESS THE ONE SENTENCE IN THE CURRENT PAPER </p><p>WHICH THE EU WOULD NOT LIKE TO BE MADE PUBLIC.  FOLLOWING </p><p>THE MEETING, FEAN, JOY, AND GRAY WORKED OUT BRIDGING </p><p>LANGUAGE WHICH THE UK PROMISED TO CIRCULATE TO ITS EU </p><p>PARTNERS. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>TERRORISM TRENDS/THREATS </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  THE UK PRESENTATION NOTED A DECREASE IN TERRORIST </p><p>INCIDENTS IN THE EU SINCE LAST FALL\'S TROIKA, PRIMARILY DUE </p><p>TO A REDUCTION IN TENSIONS IN NORTHERN IRELAND.  HOWEVER, </p><p>THE THREAT OF INDIGENOUS VIOLENCE THERE AND IN SPAIN (ETA </p><p>ATTACKS) AND FRANCE (MOSTLY CORSICA) REMAINS SIGNIFICANT. </p><p>THERE HAD BEEN NO TERRORIST ATTACKS BY NON-EU GROUPS ON EU </p><p>SOIL SINCE THE LAST TROIKA, BUT FUND-RAISING, PROPAGANDA, </p><p>AND RECRUITMENT ACTIVITIES BY EXTERNAL TERRORIST GROUPS </p><p>CONTINUE.  LUXEMBOURG MENTIONED AN INCREASE IN COOPERATION </p><p>BETWEEN TERRORISTS AND ORGANIZED CRIMINAL GROUPS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  THE UK PRESIDENCY MADE A SPECIAL PLEA ON BEHALF OF </p><p>FRANCE FOR CLOSE COOPERATION, INCLUDING INFORMATION SHAING, </p><p>IN LIGHT OF THE WORLD CUP SOCCER GAMES TO BE HELD IN FRANCE </p><p>THIS JUNE.  FRANCE IS PARTICULARLY CONCERNED BY THREATS FROM </p><p>EXTREME LEFTIST/ANARCHIC GROUPS PROTESTING THE GAMES\' </p><p>COMMERCIAL DIMENSION, ISLAMIC GROUPS, AND THOSE TARGETING </p><p>PARTICULAR NATIONAL TEAMS OR INDIVIDUALS (PLAYERS OR HIGH- </p><p>PROFILE FANS).  THE UK MADE A SIMILAR PLEA, ON BEHALF OF </p><p>PORTUGAL, FOR INFORMATION ON THREATS TO THE EXPO 98 IN </p><p>LISBON.  THE U.S., NOTING ON-GOING COOPERATION ON THESE </p><p>EVENTS, UNDERTOOK TO REMAIN VIGILANT AND SHARE INFORMATION </p><p>ON POTENTIAL THREATS WITH THE GOVERNMENTS OF FRANCE AND </p><p>PORTUGAL. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  GRAY REVIEWED U.S. PERCEPTIONS OF TERRORIST TRENDS, </p><p>NOTING AN OVERALL DECLINE IN ATTACKS BUT INCREASES IN THE </p><p>LETHALITY OF ATTACKS AND DOMESTIC TERRORISM.  THE U.S. </p><p>REMAINS TROUBLED BY INCREASED ATTACKS AGAINST CIVILIANS, THE </p><p>RISE OF RELIGIOUSLY-MOTIVATED VIOLENCE, AND THE </p><p>FRAGMENTATION OF TERRORIST GROUPS. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>IRAN, IRAQ, LIBYA </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  GRAY SURVEYED DEVELOPMENTS IN IRAN SINCE KHATAMI\'S </p><p>ELECTION, EMPHASIZING THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS DEMONSTRATED </p><p>HIS INCLINATION TO CHANGE IRAN\'S FOREIGN POLICY BUT DOES NOT </p><p>YET HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO SO COMPLETELY.  CONSEQUENTLY, THE </p><p>U.S. OBSERVES CONTINUED IRANIAN SUPPORT FOR TERRORISM, </p><p>INCLUDING THE KAZAKSTAN INCIDENT IN FEBRUARY, THE </p><p>ASSASSINATIONS OF DISSIDENTS ABROAD, THE FATWHA AGAINST </p><p>RUSHDIE, AND SUPPORT FOR GROUPS VIOLENTLY OPPOSED TO THE </p><p>MIDDLE EAST PEACE PROCESS. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  ALTHOUGH IRAN MAY NOT ALWAYS BE SUSCEPTIBLE TO </p><p>EXTERNAL INFLUENCE ON THIS QUESTION, THE U.S. AND EU SHOULD </p><p>CONTINUE TO WORK CLOSELY TOGETHER TO PUSH TEHRAN IN THE </p><p>RIGHT DIRECTION, SAID GRAY.  HE THEN URGED THE EU TO </p><p>CONTINUE, IF NOT STRENGTHEN, ITS SYPHORE SYSTEM TO REVIEW </p><p>VISA APPLICATIONS OF IRANIAN OFFICIALS; REVIEW THE SIZE OF </p><p>MOIS STATIONS IN EU CAPITALS; INCLUDE TERRORISM IN THE EU\'S </p><p>RENEWED DIALOGUE WITH IRAN; AND NOT BE SHY ABOUT CRITICIZING </p><p>IRAN IF IT IS TIED TO NEW TERRORIST INCIDENTS. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C)  FEAN RESPONDED THAT EU FOREIGN MINISTERS IN </p><p>FEBRUARY HAD PLEDGED TO KEEP UP POST-MYKONOS VIGILANCE ON </p><p>IRANIAN TERRORISM.  EU COUNTERTERRORISM EXPERTS PERFORMED AN </p><p>ASSESSMENT OF THE TERRORIST THREAT UNDER THE NEW IRANIAN </p><p>REGIME, AND HAD COME TO THE SAME CONCLUSION AS THE U.S.  THE </p><p>SYPHORE SYSTEM WILL UNDERGO A TECHNICAL (NOT POLICY) REVIEW </p><p>TO SEE HOW IT IS WORKING AND TO LOOK FOR AREAS OF </p><p>IMPROVEMENT; THE REVIEW MAY BE COMPLETE BY THE END OF JUNE. </p><p>FEAN EMPHASIZED THAT THE CONTROL OF MOIS STATIONS IS </p><p>STRICTLY A MEMBER STATE MATTER, AND URGED US TO APPROACH </p><p>CAPITALS ON THIS QUESTION.  TERRORISM WILL BE ON THE EU\'S </p><p>AGENDA WITH IRAN WHEN TALKS BEGIN IN BRUSSELS ON MAY 19. </p><p>FEAN STRESSED THAT OUR POINT ABOUT NOT BEING SHY DEPENDS IN </p><p>LARGE PART ON U.S. WILLINGNESS TO SHARE, EVEN BILATERALLY, </p><p>INFORMATION LINKING IRAN TO TERRORIST ATTACKS.  IN REPLY, </p><p>GRAY NOTED THAT THE U.S. HA RECENTLY SHARED INFORMATION ON </p><p>MOIS ACTIVITIES IN KAZAKHSTAN, AND UNDERSCORED THAT THE U.S. </p><p>WOULD CONTINUE TO SHARE SUCH INFORMATION WITH EU MEMBER </p><p>STATES IN THE FUTURE. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C)  THERE WAS GENERAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE U.S. AND </p><p>EU THAT IRAQ AND LIBYA HAD NOT SPONSORED TERRORIST ATTACKS </p><p>IN RECENT TIMES, BUT RETAINED THE CAPABILITY TO DO SO.  THE </p><p>UK NOTED THAT THE EU HAS LONG HAD AN EFFECTIVE SYSTEM FOR </p><p>SCREENING IRAQI VISA APPLICANTS. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>DESIGNATION OF TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C)  GRAY REVIEWED THE U.S. DESIGNATIONS OF FOREIGN </p><p>TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS AND UPDATED THE EU ON THE RESULTS TO </p><p>DATE AND THE LEGAL CHALLENGES TO THE LEGISLATION AND THE </p><p>DESIGNATIONS.  ARENA EDUCATED THE EU ABOUT THE HOW THE </p><p>CHALLENGES WOULD WORK THEIR WAY THROUGH THE U.S. COURTS. </p><p>THIS TOPIC DOMINATED THE SUBSEQUENT LUNCH DISCUSSION, </p><p>PARTICULARLY AS THE UK IS CONTEMPLATING LEGISLATION TO </p><p>CRIMINALIZE TERRORIST FUNDRAISING. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>INTRA-EU COOPERATION AND EUROPOL </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C)  ACCORDING TO THE UK, EU JUSTICE AND HOME AFFAIRS </p><p>MINISTERS LATER THIS MONTH WILL CONSIDER A STEPPED-UP </p><p>PROGRAM OF INTRA-EU COOPERATION ON TERRORISM.  ONE ITEM WILL </p><p>ENCOURAGE JOINT MEMBER STATE ACTION AGAINST IDENTIFIED </p><p>TERRORIST GROUPS.  THE UK WOULD LIKE TO WORK WITH OTHER </p><p>MEMBER STATES AGAINST CREDIT-CARD FRAUD BY ISLAMIC GROUPS. </p><p>THE AUSTRIANS NOTED THAT, AS A FOLLOW-ON TO THE NOVEMBER </p><p>1997 SEMINAR IN LUXEMBOURG ON TERRORIST FINANCING, THEY </p><p>INTEND TO HOST A SEMINAR IN VIENNA DURING 21-22 OCTOBER. </p><p>GRAY THANKED THEM FOR THE INVITATION AND INDICATED THAT THE </p><p>U.S. LIKELY WOULD ATTEND. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C)  DURING ITS PRESIDENCY THE UK HAS HOSTED THREE </p><p>EVENTS DESIGNED TO FOSTER CLOSER COOPERATION AMONG EU </p><p>PARTNERS:  A TWO-WEEK SEMINAR ON BOMB-SCENE MANAGEMENT, A </p><p>SEMINAR ON ARMS TRAFFICKING, AND THE FIRST-EVER SEMINAR ON </p><p>CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL TERRORISM.  ARENA SEIZED ON THE </p><p>SECOND ITEM TO EXPLAIN THAT THE BROADER DISPUTE SURROUNDING </p><p>U.S. ARMS EXPORTS TO THE EU HAD A TERRORISM DIMENSION. </p><p> </p><p>15.  (C)  AS FOR EUROPOL, THE UK EXPLAINED THAT ALL BUT TWO </p><p>MEMBER STATES HAD RATIFIED THE TREATY, AND IT IS HOPED THAT </p><p>THOSE FINAL RATIFICATIONS WILL TAKE PLACE BY THE FALL.  THE </p><p>TREATY STIPULATES THAT EUROPOL IS TO TAKE ON TERRORISM NO </p><p>LATER THAN TWO YEARS AFTER IT BEGINS OPERATIONS, BUT SPAIN </p><p>IS PROPOSING THAT IT BEGIN WORK IN THIS FIELD IN JANUARY </p><p>1999.  THE EU JUSTICE AND HOME AFFAIRS MINISTERS WILL </p><p>CONSIDER THIS PROPOSAL AT THEIR MAY MEETING.  AT ANY RATE, </p><p>THE UK CONTINUED, EUROPOL WILL TAKE AN INCREMENTAL APPROACH </p><p>TO THE PROBLEM FIRST WORKING TO SUPPORT MEMBER STATES, </p><p>PERFRM DATA ANALYSIS, AND FACILITATE INFORMATION EXHANGES; </p><p>SUBSEQUENTLY, IT WOULD DEVELOP RELATINS WITH THIRD- </p><p>COUNTRIES. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>COOPERATION WITH THE PALESTINIANS </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>16.  (C)  THE UK REVIEWED ITS THREE-YEAR PROGRAM OF </p><p>COUNTERTERRORISM COOPERATION WITH THE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY </p><p>(PA).  HAVING JUST COMPLETED A REVIEW OF THE FIRST YEAR, THE </p><p>UK SAID THE PROJECT IS OFF TO A "DECENT START" AND THAT </p><p>COOPERATION WITH THE PA IS GOOD.  THE EU HAS SENT SIX FACT- </p><p>FINDING MISSIONS FROM MEMBER-STATE SECURITY SERVICES TO THE </p><p>REGION, INCLUDING ON MANAGEMENT, EXPLOSIVE DISPOSAL, SEARCH, </p><p>INTERVIEW TECHNIQUES, AND SURVEILLANCE.  IN THE FUTURE THE </p><p>EU HOPES TO IMPLEMENT PROJECTS ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND </p><p>SECURE COMMUNICATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>17.  (C)  THE UK SAID LOCAL LIAISON BETWEEN NEILS ERICSON </p><p>AND THE U.S. HAS IMPROVED SINCE LAST FALL, AND THE EU ASKED </p><p>THAT THE U.S. TAKE BACK TO WASHINGTON THE UNION\'S STRONG </p><p>DESIRE TO KEEP UP THIS LIAISON. </p><p> </p><p>18.  (C)  DURING UK PRIME MINISTER BLAIR\'S RECENT VISIT TO </p><p>THE MIDDLE EAST, THE EU AND PA SIGNED AN AGREEMENT </p><p>ESTABLISHING A SECURITY COMMITTEE.  THE COMMITTEE, WHICH </p><p>MEETS FORTNIGHTLY AND IN TIMES OF CRISIS, DOES NOT DUPLICATE </p><p>ERICSON\'S WORK, BUT DISCUSSES JOINT SECURITY EFFORTS, </p><p>OBSTACLES TO BETTER COOPERATION, INFORMATION EXCHANGES, AND </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS PROTECTION.  ALTHOUGH NOT ADMITTED PUBLICLY, </p><p>THE PA ACCEPTS PERIODIC EVALUATIONS OF ITS PERFORMANCE. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>DRAFT UN CONVENTION ON NUCLEAR TERRORISM </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>19.  (C)  THE EU PRESIDENCY AND U.S. SHARED SIMILAR </p><p>ASSESSMENT OF THIS RUSSIAN INITIATIVE (THE EU TROIKA MET </p><p>LATER IN THE DAY WITH A RUSSIAN DELEGATION AND RAISED THIS </p><p>ISSUE).  DESPITE EARLY SKEPTICISM, IT APPEARED THAT RUSSIA </p><p>WAS WILLING TO WORK ON A VIABLE TREATY.  THE U.S. IS LOOKING </p><p>FORWARD TO THE JUNE 4-5 MOSCOW MEETING OF LEGAL EXPERTS OF </p><p>THE EIGHT TO DISCUSS THE TEXT.  THE U.S. AND EU MEMBER </p><p>STATES COORDINATED WELL DURING THE NEGOTIATIONS ON THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION FOR THE SUPPRESSION OF TERRORIST </p><p>BOMBINGS, AND THE U.S. WOULD LIKE THAT COORDINATION TO </p><p>CONTINUE. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>INTERNATIONAL CONVENTIONS ON TERRORISM </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>20.  (C)  AFTER DISTRIBUTING A SPREADSHEET SHOWING WHAT </p><p>MEMBER-STATES HAD SIGNED AND RATIFIED WHAT CONVENTIONS, THE </p><p>UK CONCLUDED THAT THERE WERE FEWER GAPS IN THE SHEET THAN </p><p>BEFORE.  THE EU\'S TERRORISM WORKING GROUP, WHICH MET ON MAY </p><p>6, MADE A MORAL (NOT LEGALLY BINDING) COMMITMENT TO HAVE </p><p>MEMBER STATES IMPLEMENT LEGISLATION FOR THE TERRORIST </p><p>BOMBING CONVENTION BY 2000.  GRAY NOTED THAT THE EIGHT HAS </p><p>CALLED ON ALL STATES TO BECOME PARTY TO ALL ELEVEN </p><p>CONVENTIONS BY THE YEAR 2000, AND THE U.S. HOPES THE EU CAN </p><p>ADOPT THE SAME POLICY.  THE UK STRESSED THAT THESE ARE </p><p>NATIONAL DECISIONS -- I.E., NOT MADE IN BRUSSELS.  MOREOVER, </p><p>THE EU HAS BEEN ADVOCATING TO THE ACCESSION STATES OF </p><p>CENTRAL EUROPE AND CYPRUS TO SIGN AND RATIFY ALL THE </p><p>CONVENTIONS.  THE EU PROMISED TO PROVIDE A SIMILAR </p><p>SPREADSHEET ON THESE COUNTRIES. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>COMPREHENSIVE CONVENTION ON TERRORISM </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>21.  (C)  THE UK NOTED THAT IT WILL RAISE THIS INDIAN </p><p>PROPOSAL WITH THE RUSSIANS LATTER THAT DAY.  THE EU HAS NO </p><p>FORMAL POSITION ON THIS QUESTION, BUT IN 1996 THE TERRORISM </p><p>WORKING GROUP DISCUSSED A SIMILAR IDEA AND CONCLUDED THAT IT </p><p>WOULD BE UNHELPFUL AND DIVISIVE.  GRAY AGREED COMPLETELY, </p><p>AND NOW THE TRICK IS TO DETERMINE HOW TO STAVE OFF OR SLOW </p><p>DOWN THE INDIAN EFFORT. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>OUTREACH </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>22.  (C)  THE UK EXPLAINED ITS OUTREACH PROGRAMS TO RUSSIA, </p><p>THE CENTRAL EUROPEAN STATES, AND CYPRUS, DESCRIBING THEM AS </p><p>FRUITFUL AND SUBSTANTIVE.  THERE IS SOME CONFUSION IN THESE </p><p>COUNTRIES BETWEEN TERRORISM AND ORGANIZED CRIME SINCE THE </p><p>LATTER OFTEN USES VIOLENCE ASSOCIATED WITH THE FORMER.  THE </p><p>EU ALSO OUTLINED THE DISCUSSION OF TERRORISM IN ITS DIALOGUE </p><p>WITH THE GCC AND IN THE EURO-MEDITERRANEAN PARTNERSHIP.  THE </p><p>U.S. DESCRIBED ITS OUTREACH PROGRAM WITH THE OAS, </p><p>EMPHASIZING THE USEFULNESS OF SUCH REGIONAL DIALOGUE BUT </p><p>NOTING THAT THE BEST COOPERATION OFTEN OCCURS BILATERALLY. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>TALEBAN, AUSTRIAN PRIORITIES, NEXT TROIKA </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>23.  (C)  GRAY PRESSED THE EU FOR A RESPONSE TO A DEMARCHE </p><p>IN MARCH ASKING THE EU TO RAISE TALEBAN SUPPORT FOR USAMA </p><p>BIN LADEN IN ITS DISCUSSIONS WITH THE TALEBAN.  THE EU DID </p><p>NOT KNOW THE STATUS OF THE REQUEST, AND PLEDGED TO GET BACK </p><p>TO US.  (COMMENT:  USEU IS STILL WAITING FOR A PROMISED </p><p>REPLY TO REPEATED REQUESTS TO THIS DEMARCHE.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>24.  (C)  THE AUSTRIANS SAID THEIR PRIORITIES WOULD BE THE </p><p>SEMINAR ON TERRORIST FINANCING NOTED ABOVE, THE CONTINUATION </p><p>OF WORKING GROUP BUSINESS, CONTINUATION OF PRACTICAL WORK </p><p>WITH THE PALESTINIANS, AND WORKING ON THE NUCLEAR TERRORISM </p><p>CONVENTION.  TRANSATLANTIC COOPERATION IS OF GREAT </p><p>IMPORTANCE TO AUSTRIA\'S PRESIDENCY, THEY CONCLUDED.  GRAY </p><p>REQUESTED THAT WE BOTH REMAIN FOCUSED ON IRAN.  HE ALSO </p><p>SUGGESTED THAT WE COULD DISCUSS THE ISSUE OF TERRORISM AND </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS. </p><p> </p><p>25.  (C)  AUSTRIA SET THE NEXT TERRORISM TROIKA FOR NOVEMBER </p><p>25, THE DAY BEFORE THANKSGIVING.  GRAY AGREED, AND EXPRESSED </p><p>HIS APPRECIATION FOR AUSTRIA\'S WILLINGNESS TO HOST A WORKING </p><p>DINNER THE NIGHT BEFORE AND TO BEGIN THE NOVEMBER 25 MEETING </p><p>EARLY ENOUGH TO ALLOW WASHINGTON REPRESENTATIVES TO RETURN </p><p>TO THE U.S. IN TIME FOR THE HOLIDAY. </p><p> </p><p>(DRAFTED:  POL:  WREGAN) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>KURSCH </p><p></p></div>
