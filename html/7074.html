<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 BRASILIA 001066 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>USTR FOR RSMITH, SCRONIN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, BR, Fee Trade Agreement of America (FTAA) </p><p>SUBJECT: BRAZILIAN FTAA COORDINATOR ON A SOCIAL AGENDA FOR </p><p>THE NEGOTIATIONS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED, PLEASE TREAT ACCORDINGLY </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Brazilian press reported on March 28 that President </p><p>Lula wants to include discussion of social issues in the FTAA </p><p>negotiations and that the GOB plans to submit proposals for </p><p>doing so at the Trade Negotiating Committee (TNC) meeting in </p><p>Puebla, Mexico April 7-11.  In discussions with EconOff on </p><p>March 31, Tovar da Silva Nunes, head of the FTAA Coordinating </p><p>Office in the Ministry of Foreign Relations (Itamaraty), </p><p>identified six social issues that the GOB will propose be </p><p>addressed formally within the FTAA process: employment, </p><p>environment, small and medium enterprises, poverty, family </p><p>agriculture, and cultural values.  (Note: the inclusion of </p><p>family agriculture is consistent with recent statements by </p><p>the Brazilian Agriculture Minister that indicate the GOB may </p><p>be softening its opposition in trade negotiations toward </p><p>certain domestic support programs that are designed to aid </p><p>family farms.)  The GOB also plans to propose that all FTAA </p><p>market access offers be made available on the internet. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) According to Tovar, Brazil will be vetting a </p><p>proposal to include discussion of these social issues within </p><p>the FTAA with its Mercosul partners in meetings April 3-4 in </p><p>Asuncion.  He indicated that the GOB plans to put forward the </p><p>concept in Puebla, with the expectation that consensus on </p><p>establishing a mechanism may not be reached until the next </p><p>TNC. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Tovar suggested that one way these issues could be </p><p>inserted into the FTAA process would be to hold separate, </p><p>hemispheric conferences for each theme.  The products of </p><p>these discussions could then be provided to Ministers for </p><p>their consideration, without obligation.  "Brazilian civil </p><p>society" reportedly identified these areas as those for which </p><p>a better understanding of the implications of the FTAA are </p><p>needed said Tovar without further elaboration.  He claimed </p><p>that the GOB does not have preconceived notions about what </p><p>might emerge from such discussions.  He also did not indicate </p><p>if the intention is that this activity would fall under the </p><p>existing FTAA Committee of Government Representatives on </p><p>Participation of Civil Society. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Tovar argued that discussions of these issues at a </p><p>hemispheric level could yield a deeper, more valuable </p><p>discourse, particularly since many issues transcend national </p><p>boundaries.  A widespread negative perception of the FTAA </p><p>still persists in Brazilian civil society, largely, Tovar </p><p>argued, out of fear of the unknown.  He claims that what NGOs </p><p>want is "access" to the process, to better understand it and </p><p>its implications.  While not expecting that the most </p><p>outspoken critics will ever offer explicit endorsements of </p><p>the FTAA, he confided that Itamaraty\'s objective is to at </p><p>least mute their criticism by incorporating them into the </p><p>process. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) COMMENT: Comments Tovar made suggest that the </p><p>proposal also reflects the heavy burden that Itamaraty is </p><p>being asked to take on regarding expanded domestic </p><p>consultations.  President Lula has publicly committed to </p><p>national discussion and debate, not only on trade policy, but </p><p>across the policy board.  Especially on trade, however, where </p><p>experience does not run deep in the PT government leadership, </p><p>the President is determined to ensure that government actions </p><p>are in tune with his social agenda, and to use expansive </p><p>consultations to achieve that aim.  Itamaraty feels under </p><p>pressure to increase its outreach to NGOs, labor unions, the </p><p>Church and other actors in civil society, as well as </p><p>Congress.  At the same time, it is having to expand internal </p><p>government consultations.  For instance, consideration is </p><p>being given to expanding the GOB trade decision-making body </p><p>(CAMEX) to include two additional ministries - Environment </p><p>and Labor.   (The six ministers that currently comprise CAMEX </p><p>are Itamaraty; Development, Industry and Trade; Agriculture; </p><p>Finance; Planning; and Casa Civil (Presidency)).  Itamaraty </p><p>may be hoping that a hemispheric process would help lighten </p><p>the load of domestic consultation.  However, Brazilian civil </p><p>society may not be so easily co-opted.  NGO reps have </p><p>recently been quoted as complaining not about access to trade </p><p>negotiators, but that their ideas have not been incorporated </p><p>into Brazilian negotiating positions.   END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) On market access issues, Tovar took the opportunity </p><p>to state that Itamaraty is still in the process of explaining </p><p>Brazilian offers and their implications internally to leaders </p><p>in the new government, many of whom are uncomfortable with </p><p>what they clearly do not understand.  Itamaraty\'s tactic at </p><p>this point is for Brazil to remain a participant within the </p><p>process by submitting offers, but ones which will be very </p><p>modest.  For instance, its services offer is expected to </p><p>merely reflect existing law, as will probably the investment </p><p>and government procurement offers, although new carve outs to </p><p>support small and medium enterprises and family farms may be </p><p>included in the government procurement offer. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) The GOB hopes to convince its Mercosul partners this </p><p>week to adopt the same minimalist approach.  If successful, </p><p>it will announce in Puebla its readiness to put forward </p><p>services, investment and government procurement offers. </p><p>Note: Brazil was able to persuade Argentina to hold back its </p><p>services offer at the last minute in mid-February, but not </p><p>Paraguay and Uruguay; it is unclear whether or not they will </p><p>all follow Brazil\'s lead this time. Within the GOB, there is </p><p>not uniform endorsement of the minimalist approach. </p><p>Reportedly, the Finance Ministry (recognizing the benefits of </p><p>expanded trade for the economy, according to Tovar) and the </p><p>Agriculture Ministry (which wants increased access for </p><p>competitive products) are pushing for more ambitious offers </p><p>with Itamaraty and the Ministry of Development taking a more </p><p>cautious approach. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) Meanwhile the Lula administration is reflecting on </p><p>various scenarios concerning the FTAA, WTO and Mercosul-EU </p><p>trade negotiations as it struggles to define a comprehensive </p><p>trade strategy, a process they hope to complete within the </p><p>next couple months.  Tovar noted what he called progress made </p><p>recently in the more advanced Mercosul-EU trade negotiations </p><p>and indicated that movement in these talks in some ways will </p><p>make it easier for the GOB to move in the WTO and FTAA, if in </p><p>no other way, because of substantial technical work already </p><p>completed by the GOB.  Tovar voiced optimism that the GOB </p><p>will be in a position to move more substantively on FTAA </p><p>market access by the summer. </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) Tovar also noted that the GOB was having difficulty </p><p>evaluating the U.S. goods offer due to technical problems. </p><p>In particular, he mentioned that the U.S. notified base rates </p><p>using HS 2002 nomenclature, but that the offer was provided </p><p>in 1996 nomenclature.  According to Tovar, 924 products were </p><p>notified for which they cannot find a corresponding tariff </p><p>line in the offer, and there were 18 items where the converse </p><p>is true.  He also complained that the trade value statistics </p><p>provided for the U.S. offer were for 2001 instead of 2002. </p><p>HRINAK </p><p></p></div>
