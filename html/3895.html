<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 RANGOON 001293 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>USCINCPAC FOR FPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/03/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, AU, BM, Human Rights </p><p>SUBJECT: DOWNER PUSHES REFORM DURING VISIT TO RANGOON </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: COM Carmen Martinez. Reason: 1.5 (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: Australian Foreign Minister Downer told Than </p><p>Shwe and Khin Nyunt that the GOB should move convincingly to </p><p>open a political dialogue with the NLD "within the next one </p><p>to two weeks."  He also urged the government to free all </p><p>political prisoners.  Khin Nyunt replied that he "fully </p><p>subscribed" to Downer\'s views on the need for prompt action </p><p>on political transition; however, neither he nor Than Shwe </p><p>made any commitments regarding a timetable for dialogue or </p><p>the release of political prisoners.  Aung San Suu Kyi </p><p>welcomed Downer\'s visit ("every bit of help was needed"), but </p><p>was resolutely skeptical about the GOB\'s plans for dialog. </p><p>She told Downer that there was no dialog with the government </p><p>and that she was not convinced that the GOB was committed to </p><p>political change.  She was also skeptical about Australian </p><p>aid initiatives, including the Australian human rights </p><p>training program.  She was not opposed to assistance per se, </p><p>provided it was "transparent, accountable, and independently </p><p>monitored."  However, she did object to any assistance whose </p><p>"nature and manner" was determined by the government.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Australian Ambassador Trevor Wilson told diplomats </p><p>October 4 that Australian Foreign Minister Downer had been </p><p>nervous about the public reaction to his decision to visit </p><p>Burma, but left satisfied with the results of the visit.  He </p><p>had come at the urging of UN Special Envoy Razali Ismail and </p><p>wanted to convey Australia\'s views directly to Burma\'s </p><p>leaders.  That plus the opportunity to form his own views </p><p>about the situation in Burma made for a good visit. </p><p> </p><p>The Message </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Downer conveyed the same message in separate meetings </p><p>with Senior General Than Shwe, Secretary 1 Khin Nyunt, </p><p>Foreign Minister Win Aung, and Home Minister Tin Hlaing. </p><p>Australia was concerned about the slow pace of political and </p><p>economic change in Burma.  It was essential, he said, that </p><p>Burma move as soon as possible ("within one to two weeks") on </p><p>political reform and transition in a way that was convincing </p><p>to the international community.  This basically meant </p><p>substantive talks with the NLD on political transition.  It </p><p>was also essential that Burma publicize those moves and </p><p>supplement them with measures to establish good faith, </p><p>basically through the release of all political prisoners. </p><p>Downer predicted that such moves would have "a big impact" </p><p>internationally, and would help restart foreign investment </p><p>flows for Burma. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) On the economy, Downer told both Than Shwe and Khin </p><p>Nyunt that Burma had to adapt to globalization; it could not </p><p>cut itself off from the world.  It needed technocrats to run </p><p>the economy and assistance to deal with its many humanitarian </p><p>problems.  Political transition, however, was the key.  If it </p><p>did not move forward on political transition, it would not </p><p>get the support it needed from the world community. </p><p> </p><p>Secretary One </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) In reply, Secretary 1 Khin Nyunt told Downer that he </p><p>"fully subscribed" to Downer\'s views about taking steps to </p><p>show that the process of political transition was on track. </p><p>He also stated that that he believed it was essential that </p><p>the GOB cooperate with UN Special Envoy Razali, UN Special </p><p>Rapporteur Pinheiro, and the ILO.  However, neither he nor </p><p>Senior General Than Shwe made any commitments to Downer </p><p>regarding the timing of any steps in regard to political </p><p>transition.  Neither did any member of the government make </p><p>any commitments regarding the release of political prisoners. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Khin Nyunt did claim that the dialog with the NLD was </p><p>not stalled.  He also called Aung San Suu Kyi\'s shift to "a </p><p>more constructive approach" a very positive step, one that </p><p>had allowed the government and the NLD to deal with each </p><p>other on a basis of mutual understanding "like members of one </p><p>family." </p><p> </p><p>Than Shwe </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Than Shwe did not mention either the dialog or Aung </p><p>San Suu Kyi.  However, he did emphasize that he did not want </p><p>the military to remain in power forever, or ever again have </p><p>to assume power in Burma.  That was not good for the either </p><p>the country or the military.  Rather, he wanted to build a </p><p>democratic system that would endure.  For Burma, that </p><p>required national unity, education, and economic development. </p><p> Than Shwe did not respond to Downer\'s points regarding the </p><p>economy, but also did not object to Downer\'s grim description </p><p>of Burma\'s economic prospects, and did not ask for any type </p><p>of Australian assistance. </p><p> </p><p>Home Minister Tin Hlaing </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Downer told Home Minister Tin Hlaing that there was no </p><p>reason for the GOB to hold any political prisoners and that </p><p>he hoped that all would be released quickly.  He also told </p><p>Tin Hlaing that Australia was very satisfied with its </p><p>counternarcotics cooperation with Burma and had just decided </p><p>to assign a second liaison officer from the Australian </p><p>Federal Police to the Embassy in Rangoon.  Australia was also </p><p>happy with its human rights training for Burmese police </p><p>officers, but wanted to expand the program to include </p><p>organizations like the NLD.  Tin Hlaing said that the GOB was </p><p>"prepared to consider that," however, according to Ambassador </p><p>Wilson, details on the expanded program still have to be </p><p>worked out. </p><p> </p><p>Aung San Suu Kyi </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Aung San Suu Kyi told Downer that she was glad he had </p><p>come.  "Every bit of help was needed," she said, to move the </p><p>GOB forward on political transition.  However, she stated </p><p>categorically that no dialog was taking place with the </p><p>government.  She also said that there had been no significant </p><p>contacts between the GOB and the NLD, and that she was not </p><p>convinced that the GOB was committed to the process of </p><p>political change.  In regard to aid, she also told Downer </p><p>that she was not opposed to any type of assistance for Burma, </p><p>provided that assistance was "transparent, accountable, and </p><p>independently monitored."  However, she had reservations </p><p>about any assistance provided to the government and "would </p><p>not support" any assistance whose "nature and manner" was </p><p>determined by the government.  She was also skeptical about </p><p>the value of Australia\'s human rights training for the </p><p>government.  Progress on human rights, she said, would depend </p><p>on political change.  No amount of training could substitute </p><p>for that.  She also said that she prefers a coordinated </p><p>approach to aid; an approach that was coordinated among </p><p>donors would have more impact on the GOB; it would also leave </p><p>fewer "loopholes" for the government to exploit. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) It is hard to say what impact Downer\'s visit will </p><p>have on the reform process here.  His comments regarding </p><p>political transition, the economy, and the growing </p><p>humanitarian problems in Burma were certainly on the mark. </p><p>However, it is hard to tell how seriously the government took </p><p>those remarks.  While Khin Nyunt asserted that he "fully </p><p>subscribed" to Downer\'s views on the need for prompt and </p><p>convincing motion in regard to political transition, Than </p><p>Shwe did not take up that theme, nor did anyone else echo it. </p><p> As usual, we will simply have to wait and see whether there </p><p>is any significant motion over the next several weeks. </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) The Australians\' initiative on human rights training </p><p>for organizations "like the NLD," and the Home Minister\'s </p><p>response to that initiative, was also interesting.  It may be </p><p>that the GOB is now ready to consider opening the doors </p><p>somewhat in regard to involving the NLD in assistance </p><p>programs, if only as recipients.  If true, even that would be </p><p>a step forward, although the entire initiative still needs to </p><p>be discussed with the NLD.  According to Ambassador Wilson, </p><p>Downer did not discuss Australia\'s plans for the program with </p><p>Aung San Suu Kyi. </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) Finally, it was gratifying to hear how direct Downer </p><p>was with Than Shwe.  According to Ambassador Wilson, Khin </p><p>Nyunt and Win Aung had both asked Downer to go easy on Than </p><p>Shwe and not be so rude as Japanese Foreign Minister </p><p>Kawaguchi in raising awkward issues.  To his credit, Downer </p><p>ignored the GOB advice and followed Kawaguchi\'s example. </p><p>Than Shwe needs to hear what Downer had to say and, in Post\'s </p><p>view, it is good that Downer was willing to take the </p><p>political risks and political heat associated with this visit </p><p>in order to put his points across.
