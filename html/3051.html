END NOTE. </p><p> </p><p>6. WFP WAS TASKED WITH DOING THE NECESSARY ANALYSIS, </p><p>INCLUDING FUNDING OPTIONS, AND PROVIDING THIS INFORMATION TO </p><p>ITS EXTERNAL AUDITOR (THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT\'S COUR DES </p><p>COMPTES) IN ORDER TO OBTAIN RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE </p><p>EXTERNAL AUDITOR AT THE OCTOBER 2002 BOARD MEETING. THE </p><p>SECRETARIAT WILL CIRCULATE TO THE BOARD BY THE FIRST WEEK IN </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>JUNE AN ANNOTATED OUTLINE OF THE DOCUMENT(S) TO BE SUBMITTED </p><p>FOR CONSIDERATION IN OCTOBER 2002. MOREOVER, AN INFORMAL </p><p>CONSULTATION WITH THE BOARD ON ISC/PSA IS SCHEDULED FOR </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  02629  02 OF 04  310722Z </p><p>SEPTEMBER. </p><p> </p><p>7. THE ISC DISCUSSION DEMONSTRATED THAT THE MODE OF </p><p>CALCULATING INDIRECT SUPPORT COSTS REQUIRES FURTHER </p><p>REFINEMENT. THE U.S. POSITION REMAINS THAT WFP\'S INDIRECT </p><p>SUPPORT COSTS REFLECT A REASONABLE MEASURE OF COSTS WHICH </p><p>WOULD USUALLY ACCOMPANY AN ACTIVITY. MOREOVER, THE U.S. </p><p>FAVORS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF DECLINING MARGINAL COSTS </p><p>ASSOCIATED WITH DONATIONS I.E., AS THE QUANTITY OF DONATIONS </p><p>INCREASE, THERE WOULD BE A DECREASE IN OVERHEAD COSTS ON A </p><p>PER UNIT BASIS. ON THE MARGINS OF THE ISC DISCUSSION, IT WAS </p><p>APPARENT TO USDEL THAT: (A) THE PRESENT WFP ACCOUNTING </p><p>SYSTEM (WINGS) IS A MAJOR IMPROVEMENT CAPABLE OF GENERATING </p><p>THE DATA TO ESTABLISH APPROPRIATE RATES; AND (B) THE NEW </p><p>EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR JIM MORRIS AND HIS CHIEF OF STAFF MICHAEL </p><p>STAYTON ARE SEIZED WITH THE PROBLEM AND COMMITTED TO </p><p>SUCCESSFULLY RESOLVING IT. MORRIS RELATED THAT WFP WAS NOW </p><p>PRODUCING (AS OF APRIL, 2002 A MONTHLY FINANCIAL STATEMENT) </p><p>AND THAT HE IS PERSONALLY COMMITTED TO "MINIMIZING OUR FIXED </p><p>COSTS" AND KEEPING "CASH BALANCES AT REASONABLE LEVELS." </p><p>MORRIS REITERATED THAT: "WE NOW HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO </p><p>BETTER IDENTIFY UNUSED PROGRAM FUNDS TO EITHER RETURN TO OR </p><p>ASK TO HAVE THEM REPROGRAMMED BY OUR DONORS." </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p>CONSOLIDATED FRAMEWORK OF WFP POLICIES: ESTABLISHING AND </p><p>MAINTAINING A GOVERNANCE TOOL </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p> </p><p>8. WFP PRESENTED A CONSOLIDATED FRAMEWORK (COMPENDIUM) OF </p><p>APPROVED WFP POLICIES WHICH THE BOARD WELCOMED. THE BOARD </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  02629  02 OF 04  310722Z </p><p>ASKED THE SECRETARIAT TO MAINTAIN AN UPDATED VERSION OF IT </p><p>ON THE WFP WEBSITE, INCORPORATING NEW POLICY DECISIONS AFTER </p><p>EACH BOARD SESSION AS APPROPRIATE. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>URBAN FOOD INSECURITY </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. THE BOARD AGREED THAT WFP FOOD ASSISTANCE IN EMERGENCY </p><p>AND DEVELOPING SETTINGS SHOULD ADDRESS URBAN FOOD SECURITY </p><p>WHEN APPROPRIATE. THE BOARD SUGGESTED A SET OF WFP </p><p>GUIDELINES TO ASSIST COUNTRY OFFICES IN PROGRAMMING MORE </p><p>EFFECTIVELY IN URBAN SETTINGS. </p><p> </p><p>10. THE LARGER PROBLEM FOR WFP IS THAT ITS DEVELOPMENT </p><p>PORTFOLIO HAS FALLEN FROM ALMOST USD 1 BILLION A DECADE AGO </p><p>TO USD 273 MILLION IN 2001. GERMANY, A SUPPORTER OF </p><p>DEVELOPMENT FOOD AID, SUGGESTED FOR 2003, AN INDEPENDENT </p><p>EXTERNAL EVALUATION OF WFP\'S DEVELOPMENT PORTFOLIO (WHICH IT </p><p>IS WILLING TO PARTIALLY FUND).

A NUMBER OF DONORS </p><p>(LED BY USDEL) INSISTED THAT THE UN HIRE MORE WOMEN </p><p>EMPLOYEES FOR UN-LOCAL HIRE JOBS, DEPLOY MORE WOMEN </p><p>INTERNATIONAL STAFF AND MAINSTREAM WOMEN\'S CONCERNS INTO UN </p><p>OPERATIONS. SPECIFICALLY IN WEST AFRICA, IT WAS HIGHLIGHTED </p><p>THAT THE INVESTIGATION (PRESENTLY BEING CONDUCTED BY THE </p><p>UN\'S OFFICE OF INTERNAL OVERSIGHT SERVICES (OIOS)) NEEDED TO </p><p>BE QUICK, OPEN AND THOROUGH IN ORDER TO ASSURE THAT THE </p><p>PROBLEM HAD BEEN ADEQUATELY ADDRESSED AND JUSTICE DONE. </p><p> </p><p>12.

THE BOARD APPROVED A PLEDGING TARGET OF USD 2.67 BILLION </p><p>FOR THE BIENNIUM 2003-2004 (DEVELOPMENT, EMERGENCIES (EMOPS) </p><p>AND PROTRACTED RELIEF AND RECOVERY OPERATIONS (PRROS). THE </p><p>AMOUNT CORRESPONDS ROUGHLY TO THE 2001-2002 TARGET OF USD </p><p>2.6 BILLION AND IS ALREADY CONTAINED IN THE PREVIOUSLY </p><p>APPROVED 2002-2005 STRATEGIC AND FINANCIAL PLAN. THE UNITED </p><p>STATES AGREED WITH THE POSITION ADOPTED BY THE BOARD THAT, </p><p>IN GENERAL, "PLEDGING CONFERENCES (INCLUDING THIS ONE </p><p>SCHEDULED FOR NOVEMBER 2002) HAVE OUTLIVED THEIR </p><p>USEFULNESS."

THE U.S. CONTINUES TO PROVIDE A HIGH SHARE OF WFP\'S </p><p>BUDGET (SOME 63 PERCENT IN 2001) AND WFP IS HEAVILY RELIANT </p><p>ON THE U.S. TO MEET THE EVER GROWING NUMBER OF HUMANITARIAN </p><p>CRISIS WORLDWIDE.
