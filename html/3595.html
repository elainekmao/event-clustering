<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001977 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: GOVERNMENT PRESS STILL INDIGNANT </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under headline "We stand by our cause" the </p><p>      government-controlled daily "Chronicle" dedicated its </p><p>      August 27 editorial to criticizing the United States </p><p>      for meddling in Zimbabwe\'s internal affairs. </p><p>      Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   "The American and their cousins in Europe have </p><p>      perfected the art of seeking to protect their </p><p>      interests through interference in the affairs of </p><p>      sovereign states.  Moreover, where they seem to </p><p>      be failing, they always try to divide the people </p><p>      along ethnic lines in order to find means of </p><p>      achieving their ends. . .  It is sad that </p><p>      Americans, who have long touted themselves as </p><p>      the paragons of democracy, should be engaging in </p><p>      nefarious activities that only despots would </p><p>      fathom.  News that America is fantasizing about </p><p>      removing President Mugabe - the people\'s choice </p><p>      - violently from power in cahoots with some </p><p>      supposedly lily-livered states with whom </p><p>      Zimbabwe shares a border, made interesting </p><p>      reading.  As expected those countries that were </p><p>      named as party to the conspiracy. . .have </p><p>      distanced themselves from the American madness. </p><p>      . .  We will not brook any nonsense from Uncle </p><p>      Toms et al who think they know it all. </p><p>      Zimbabweans have a right to decide their </p><p>      destiny, and we demand that right! </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
