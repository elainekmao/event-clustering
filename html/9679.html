<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L  ZAGREB 001674 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/24/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, HR, War Crimes, Regional Issues, Refugee, Political Parties/Elections </p><p>SUBJECT: PM RACAN TO AMBASSADOR: EAGER TO IMPROVE TIES WITH </p><p>U.S. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Ralph Frank, for reasons </p><p>1.5 (b) and (d) </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) During their first meeting, on July 23, Prime </p><p>Minister Racan said he wanted good ties with the newly </p><p>arrived U.S. Ambassador.  He alluded to sometimes rocky </p><p>relations in the past, and stressed that it would be </p><p>important to keep in regular contact, both formally and </p><p>informally.  Racan was optimistic about upcoming elections in </p><p>Croatia, indicating he expected more or less the same </p><p>coalition to return to power -- although he suggested that he </p><p>may be ready to step aside as Prime Minister.  Racan </p><p>underscored Croatia\'s role in the region as a source of </p><p>stability.  That included Croatia\'s role in the war on </p><p>terrorism, which his government takes very seriously.  He </p><p>said that Croatia remained committed to overcoming its </p><p>wartime legacy, including by cooperating with ICTY.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Racan Wants Strong U.S.-Croatia Relations </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) PM Racan opened his July 23 one-on-one meeting with </p><p>Ambassador Frank by saying that the U.S. had special </p><p>importance for him; while he usually lets the President and </p><p>the Foreign Minister deal with foreign diplomats, he wanted </p><p>to maintain regular contact, formally and informally, with </p><p>the U.S. Ambassador.   It was a positive theme that dominated </p><p>the one-and-half-hour introductory meeting.  Both the </p><p>Ambassador and Prime Minister agreed to look to the future, </p><p>to build on what the Ambassador described as a very good, </p><p>solid bilateral relationship.  Racan wanted to ensure that </p><p>the interests of the U.S. in Croatia were well taken care of, </p><p>and he would view acts of anti-Americanism as acts against </p><p>Croatia.  He said Croatia was with the U.S. in the fight </p><p>against terrorism. </p><p>Force of Stability </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Throughout the discussion, Racan stressed the </p><p>importance of stability, both for Croatia and the region, </p><p>both of which had only recently emerged from war.  He saw </p><p>Croatia as a force of stability, and saw it as the country\'s </p><p>"duty" to play that role effectively.  He contrasted </p><p>Croatia\'s role with that of Bosnia next door, where the </p><p>"Islamic lobby" figured more prominently.  To  illustrate </p><p>this, Racan referred to his recent visit to Sarajevo and his </p><p>initiative for Croatia to help build a highway in Bosnia </p><p>along the European 5C route.  He said he made the proposal </p><p>despite knowing he was touching a  "hornet\'s nest."  He said </p><p>BiH authorities had already secured capital for the project, </p><p>and suggested the influence of "Islamic capital" could </p><p>destabilize Bosnia and the region.  Racan referred to the </p><p>fact that as many as 150 mosques had been built in recent </p><p>years in Sarajevo, which he did not mind as a religious </p><p>phenomenon, but he did mind if this upset the balance of all </p><p>religious/ethnic groups in Bosnia. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Racan cited a number of recent GOC initiatives as </p><p>examples of Croatia\'s role in improving regional stability, </p><p>including suspending visas requirements for SAM citizens, and </p><p>its costly decision to compensate ethnic Serb returnee </p><p>holders of tenancy rights.  The Prime Minister emphasized  -- </p><p>sometimes implausibly -- that the GOC always had in mind the </p><p>wider regional situation, even when making decisions that </p><p>might result in differences with the U.S.  He argued that the </p><p>GOC decision to sign the Vilnius Group declaration -- which </p><p>was  generally supportive of the U.S. position on Iraq -- was </p><p>made out of a desire to preserve regional stability.  When </p><p>the GOC subsequently back-pedaled on the  declaration, and </p><p>stated Croatia\'s opposition to the war in Iraq, Racan said he </p><p>was upset to have his "leadership" questioned.  This was not </p><p>about leadership,  Racan argued, but rather about preserving </p><p>stability in the country.  Anti-war sentiment, about 80 </p><p>percent of the population, could not be ignored. </p><p> </p><p>U.S. and EU Share Views on Croatia </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) The Ambassador noted that the U.S. and Croatia had </p><p>sufficiently good relations that the two could disagree </p><p>privately -- not in the press -- on some subjects while </p><p>maintaining many common goals.  The Ambassador stressed the </p><p>importance of regional stability, U.S. support for Croatia\'s </p><p>accession to Euro-Atlantic institutions, and the importance </p><p>for Croatia to press ahead on  economic reforms and job </p><p>creation.  He added that both the U.S. and its EU  partners </p><p>shared the same goals with regard to Croatia, including full </p><p>cooperation with ICTY, the return of refugees, and the full </p><p>normalization of relations with its neighbors.  The </p><p>Ambassador stressed that these issues, which emerged from </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Croatia\'s wartime legacy, remained critical and could not be </p><p>ignored. </p><p> </p><p>Elections </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) The Ambassador asked the Prime Minister to comment on </p><p>the upcoming elections.  Racan replied that he did not expect </p><p>great changes, unless the coalition made some big mistakes. </p><p>Although Croatians are still dissatisfied with things this </p><p>government has failed to do (i.e. prosecute corruption in </p><p>privatization and reform the judiciary and state </p><p>administration), they do recognize the government\'s </p><p>achievements: general economic progress, including low </p><p>inflation; stronger regional cooperation; substantial </p><p>movement on NATO and EU accession; and road building and </p><p>railroad modernization.  The positive trends will continue if </p><p>the current coalition stays in power.  The return of  the HDZ </p><p>would probably mean a return to the Tudjman era  -- which </p><p>voters do not want.  As for possible changes in the make up </p><p>of a new government, Racan somewhat unconvincingly suggested </p><p>he may not want to be Prime Minister again.  He was </p><p>exhausted, he said. </p><p> </p><p>HDZ: New and Improved? </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Speaking about the main opposition party, Racan said </p><p>that, although the HDZ leadership might be "new and </p><p>improved," the party base remained more or less the same -- </p><p>one reminiscent of Tudjman times.  The HDZ can complete its </p><p>transformation only if it loses elections.  If it wins, the </p><p>current opposition phase of transformation would merely be </p><p>perceived as a temporary halt before the return to the same </p><p>kind of rule under Tudjman.  Racan encouraged the Ambassador </p><p>to maintain contact with the HDZ leadership, if only because </p><p>such contact may encourage the reformers.  But reform of that </p><p>party, he added, was a long way off.  Racan noted that the </p><p>more reform-minded leaders of HDZ in Bosnia told him on his </p><p>recent visit that they would like to see Racan\'s government </p><p>-- rather than one led by HDZ -- win the next election. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) A pragmatic -- if sometimes phlegmatic -- politician, </p><p>PM Racan came across as somebody who wants improved relations </p><p>with the U.S.  He will be busy in coming weeks preparing for </p><p>elections and cajoling his government to move forward on </p><p>Croatia\'s EU requirements, but he told the Ambassador that he </p><p>wanted to meet regularly.  Racan suggested getting together </p><p>again at the end of August.  As for Racan\'s hint that he may </p><p>be ready to step aside as Prime Minister, this was not </p><p>conveyed with Shermanesque certitude; few other such rumors </p><p>have circulated, and we suspect that, as of now, it should </p><p>not be taken seriously.  Racan waited in the wings for years </p><p>to get to power.  Assuming the ruling coalition wins, he will </p><p>want to remain Prime Minister a good while longer. </p><p>FRANK </p><p>NNNN </p><p></p></div>
