<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 GUATEMALA 001541 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT OF STATE FOR DRL/IL, WHA/CEN, WHA/PPC, </p><p>CA/VO and G/TIP </p><p>DEPARTMENT OF LABOR FOR ILAB: ROBERT WHOLEY </p><p>USTR FOR CHRIS WILSON </p><p>GENEVA FOR ROBERT HAGEN </p><p>PLEASE PASS TO OPIC: GREG MAGGIO </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ELAB, KCRM, KWMN, ETRD, CVIS, GT </p><p>SUBJECT: GUATEMALA LABOR AND TIP UPDATE #4 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  The following is an update of significant recent </p><p>developments in the labor sector.  Topics include: </p><p> </p><p>-- Bilateral Labor Group Convoked for Early July (para </p><p>2) </p><p> </p><p>-- Union Leader Arrested in Social Security Scandal </p><p>(3) </p><p> </p><p>-- Choi Shin/Cimatextiles in the GOG\'s Crosshairs (4) </p><p> </p><p>-- American Data Processing "Maquila" Conflict </p><p>Unresolved (5) </p><p> </p><p>-- GOG Wants to Facilitate H2B Program (6) </p><p> </p><p>-- Penal Code Reform Stiffens Penalties for </p><p>Trafficking in Persons (7) </p><p> </p><p>Bilateral Labor Group Convoked for Early July </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) On June 11 LabAtt requested MFA convoke </p><p>another meeting of the GOG\'s Labor Working Group for </p><p>the first week of July.  Sara Solis, MFA Director for </p><p>Bilateral Affairs, agreed to do so, and said the </p><p>inter-ministerial GOG Working Group had met recently </p><p>and would soon be formally constituted by government </p><p>decree.  The Embassy hopes to use this meeting to </p><p>maintain momentum on labor issues raised in the first </p><p>meeting (prosecution of violent crimes against union </p><p>leaders, need to streamline the labor justice system, </p><p>and the need to reinstate workers illegally fired for </p><p>unionization activity) on May 13 with participation </p><p>from USTR, USDOL and Department officials.  The </p><p>Embassy will represent the USG in this meeting, and </p><p>would welcome Department\'s guidance on the status of </p><p>GSP petitions against Guatemala. </p><p> </p><p>Union Leader Arrested </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Rigoberto Duenas, Adjunct Secretary General </p><p>of the Central General Union of Guatemalan Workers </p><p>(CGTG), was arrested on June 8 for his participation </p><p>as a member of the Board of Directors of the National </p><p>Social Security Institute (IGSS) in a major financial </p><p>scandal involving the misuse of public funds by that </p><p>institution.  Duenas was the first member of the board </p><p>arrested, and unions have protested his innocence and </p><p>accused the government of seeking a "scapegoat" for </p><p>the scandal.  The scandal involved a housing </p><p>construction scheme using IGSS funds, which was </p><p>authorized by the board but implemented fraudulently </p><p>by IGSS managers (Guatemala 1388 and 1465).  The </p><p>Ambassador expressed concern over the arrest to </p><p>Attorney General De Leon on June 11.  LabAtt and Pol </p><p>Section Intern met with the CGTG executive board and </p><p>Mrs. Duenas on June 12.  The union requested Embassy </p><p>assistance to guarantee the safety of Duenas in </p><p>custody.  LabAtt requested such assistance from the </p><p>Attorney General\'s Private Secretary on June 12 and </p><p>was assured that the Director of Prisons had already </p><p>beefed up the security in the hospital of the </p><p>Preventive Detention Center, where Duenas and one </p><p>other IGSS board member is being held. </p><p>Choi Shin/Cimatextiles in the Crosshairs </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) The GOG has given the management of the Choi </p><p>Shin/Cimatextiles maquila plants until June 27 to </p><p>respond to pending labor rights complaints by workers </p><p>or lose its permission to export from Guatemala.  NGO </p><p>sources report that Minister of Labor Victor Moreira </p><p>(currently in Geneva for ILO meetings) intends to </p><p>compel Choi Shin/Cimatextiles management to engage in </p><p>collective bargaining with the only existing unions in </p><p>the maquila sector.  Those unions were established </p><p>after anti-union violence provoked GOG intervention in </p><p>July 2001.  Press reports about the GOG\'s action </p><p>against these factories provoked concern among union </p><p>members about possible new violence from non-union </p><p>workers.  LabAtt called Choi Shin management on June 3 </p><p>to express concern about possible violence and was </p><p>assured by management that the plant was calm.  The </p><p>Embassy and concerned U.S. NGOs are monitoring this </p><p>situation closely, and have encouraged management to </p><p>continue dialogue with the unions. </p><p>American Data Processing "Maquila" Conflict Unresolved </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p>5. (SBU) The U.S. data processing subsidiary ACS-BPS </p><p>of Guatemala has entered into negotiations with seven </p><p>employees who prefer to resign than to accept new data </p><p>processing tasks under an internal reorganization. </p><p>The seven have filed labor complaints with the labor </p><p>courts and want management to provide a severance </p><p>package including lawyers fees not required under </p><p>labor law. </p><p> </p><p>GOG Wants to Facilitate H2B Program </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) ConGen, NIV Chief and LabAtt met with Vice </p><p>Minister of Labor Sandra Mendez de Garrido June 11 to </p><p>discuss the Ministry\'s interest in facilitating the </p><p>flow of H2B temporary work visa applicants.  NIV Chief </p><p>provided feedback from U.S. employers concerned by the </p><p>registry and deposit requirements of the Guatemalan </p><p>Labor Code (article 34), which date to the early </p><p>1950\'s and, if implemented, would probably drive U.S. </p><p>recruiters elsewhere.  The Vice Minister said that her </p><p>intent is not to enforce these parts of the Code, but </p><p>to reform them, if necessary, to protect and expand </p><p>the flow of H2B workers.  The Ministry would like to </p><p>contact U.S. employers to offer its employment service </p><p>as an alternative to Guatemalan recruiters, many of </p><p>whom are corrupt.  ConGen asked the Vice Minister to </p><p>provide an email address to which the Embassy can </p><p>refer interested U.S. employers, and suggested the </p><p>Vice Minister consider visiting the U.S. to witness </p><p>working conditions of Guatemalan workers and meet with </p><p>USDOL counterparts.  We are exploring possible USG </p><p>support for such a visit under the Voluntary Visitor </p><p>Program. </p><p> </p><p>Reforms Would Stiffen Penalties for TIP </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) On June 10 The Congressional Commissions on </p><p>Women and Legislation approved reforms to the Criminal </p><p>Code which would increase the penalty for trafficking </p><p>in persons from two to five years in prison.  The </p><p>reforms would also increase the fine penalties for </p><p>pimping from two to ten thousand Quetzales (approx. </p><p>$1,282). </p><p> </p><p>Hamilton </p><p></p></div>
