<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 004193 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/02/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY: SEZER UNDER FIRE FOR ANTI-REFORM STANCE </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 4179 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Political Counselor John Kunstadter. </p><p>Reason: 1.5 (b)(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) As reported reftel, President Sezer vetoed an article </p><p>in the AK Government\'s sixth EU Copenhagen Criteria </p><p>harmonization package, which Parliament had passed with a </p><p>unanimous vote -- a rare occurrence in Turkey.  The veto </p><p>overruled a provision abolishing Turkey\'s controversial </p><p>Article 8 of the Anti-Terror Law, which has long been cited </p><p>as a major obstacle to democratization and free speech. </p><p>According to press, Sezer asserted that lifting Article 8 </p><p>"would lead to a strong probability that the existence of the </p><p>Turkish Republic, and the integrity of its territory and the </p><p>nation, would be harmed." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Reaction to Sezer\'s move has been swift and critical, </p><p>with not only religious conservatives and liberals but </p><p>influential pro-Establishment columnists July 2 hammering </p><p>Sezer as an opponent of reform and modernization -- and, </p><p>hence, of Turkey\'s EU candidacy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Mainstream secularist columnist Yalcin Dogan of centrist </p><p>mass-circulation "Hurriyet" asserted that President Sezer is </p><p>"acting as a brake on EU reforms."  Similarly, Hasan Cemal of </p><p>left-of-center "Milliyet" criticized Sezer\'s veto and urged </p><p>both AK and the opposition CHP to cooperate to speed up the </p><p>EU membership process -- the most vital project in Turkey </p><p>since Ataturk\'s initial reforms, Cemal asserted. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Liberal Cuneyt Ulsever of "Hurriyet" said that Sezer "is </p><p>influenced by the efforts of some military commanders to </p><p>preserve the status quo and hamper the EU membership drive." </p><p>Left-of-center Mehmet Ali Birand of centrist mass appeal </p><p>"Posta" charged that Sezer "is afraid" of freedom of thought. </p><p> "We know about the circles...that perpetuate their dominance </p><p>by injecting fear into society.  We had thought that Sezer </p><p>was outside of those circles."  While those accused of being </p><p>"Islamists" are actually trying to bring Turkey into Europe, </p><p>Birand wrote, those who claim to speak in the name of Ataturk </p><p>are trying to stop Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Hasan Celal Guzel of secular/conservative "Tercuman" wrote </p><p>that the 1982 constitution (note: written under the </p><p>military\'s direction) should be abolished as a whole, </p><p>otherwise it will be "impossible to issue and implement </p><p>reforms in this country." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Ilnur Cevik of the English-language, small circulation </p><p>"Turkish Daily News" called Sezer "morally wrong."  People at </p><p>home and abroad, Cevik asserted, will regard Sezer as a </p><p>supporter of the Establishment "fighting a losing war to </p><p>preserve the status quo." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) In addition to Article 8, Sezer\'s veto also amounted </p><p>to a rejection of the AK Government\'s effort to abolish the </p><p>legal justification used to reduce penalties for "honor </p><p>killings," which for procedural reasons had been included in </p><p>the same provision of the package.  As defined in the annual </p><p>Human Rights Report for Turkey, honor killings are "the </p><p>killing by immediate family members of women suspected of </p><p>being unchaste."  Sezer did not offer his reasoning on the </p><p>honor killings issue.  Legal experts at both the Presidency </p><p>and Parliament noted to us that procedurally, Sezer was bound </p><p>to veto the entire provision -- that in order to get at </p><p>Article 8, he would have to veto the other elements of the </p><p>same provision. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Public opinion polls have routinely shown Sezer as one </p><p>of the most respected figures in Turkey, largely because of </p><p>his reputed honesty and, as a former Chief Justice, his </p><p>reputation as an expert on the law.  However, he now finds </p><p>himself squarely on the opposite side of a populace that is </p><p>eager for reform and less willing to accept received wisdom </p><p>from above.  The July 2 issue of centrist intellectual </p><p>"Radikal" noted that, according to an academic survey, 73 </p><p>percent of Turks believe human rights violations are </p><p>widespread in Turkey.  Only 48 percent of judiciary officials </p><p>hold the same view.  "Radikal\'s" page-one headline concluded </p><p>that "the people are ahead of the judiciary." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Turkish citizens are becoming ever more alienated from </p><p>the State apparat, which they see as merely preserving a </p><p>status quo both: 1) hostile to individual rights; and 2) </p><p>irredeemably corrupt.  It is illustrative of the changes </p><p>under way in Turkey that, in order to go after Article 8, </p><p>Sezer had to reject honor killing reform.  This presents </p><p>another irony: that a party with religious roots, and accused </p><p>of a sinister "pro-Sharia agenda" by the Establishment, is </p><p>trying to eliminate a law that: 1) has long been on the books </p><p>in secularist Turkey; and 2) reflects a pervasive, </p><p>religiously-tinged tribal practice. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
