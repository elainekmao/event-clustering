<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L RANGOON 000635 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/30/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINS, PREL, BM, NLD, ASSK </p><p>SUBJECT: NLD, GOVERNMENT SUPPORTERS CLASH IN NORTHERN BURMA </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: The military junta may be preparing a new </p><p>crackdown on Aung San Suu Kyi and the National League for </p><p>Democracy.  At a news conference May 31, the government </p><p>accused the NLD of provoking a riot in Sagaing Division </p><p>northwest of Mandalay that left four dead and more than 50 </p><p>injured. It also closed NLD headquarters and placed members </p><p>of the NLD\'s Central Executive Committee under house arrest </p><p>in Rangoon.  Aung San Suu Kyi herself, and senior members of </p><p>her traveling party, have been held in Ye Oo in Sagaing </p><p>Division, ostensibly for their own safety. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) At a press conference held May 31, the SPDC accused </p><p>the NLD of provoking a riot on May 30 in Depeyin in Sagaing </p><p>Division northwest of Mandalay.  According to the government, </p><p>Aung San Suu Kyi\'s traveling party was met by a crowd of </p><p>about 5,000 anti-NLD protesters as it reached Depeyin.  An </p><p>argument broke out which degenerated into about a riot, </p><p>leaving four dead and more than 50 wounded.  According to </p><p>news reports (which we have not been able to confirm), Aung </p><p>San Suu Kyi\'s car was also hit by gunfire.  She was not hurt, </p><p>but was taken, together with 19 members of her traveling </p><p>party, to Ye Oo in Sagaing Division (also northwest of </p><p>Mandalay), where she was held, ostensibly for her own safety. </p><p>In Rangoon, NLD headquarters was closed and members of the </p><p>NLD\'s Central Executive Committee were placed under house </p><p>arrest. Burmese police special branch members told Poloff on </p><p>May 31 that both NLD spokesman U  Lwin and CEC member U Nyunt </p><p>Wei have been detained under section 10(B) of Burma\'s Public </p><p>Security Act, which allows the government to detain </p><p>\'subversive elements" for up to one year without a trial. </p><p>Most likely, all other members of the NLD\'s Central Executive </p><p>Committee have also been placed under house arrest. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Earlier in the day, the government\'s official </p><p>newspaper, the Myanmar Alin carried stories on its front and </p><p>back pages which accused the NLD of provoking disturbances in </p><p>Chaung U and Mon Ywa in Burma\'s Sagaing division.  According </p><p>to the newspaper, in Ye Bo San village and Mon Ywa, ASSK\'s </p><p>party, reportedly about 150 people traveling in 16 cars and </p><p>70 motorcycles, ended up in an altercation with "peaceful </p><p>protesters" that left several injured and resulted in both </p><p>sides filing charges at local police station.  According to </p><p>the government, this followed clashes earlier in the month in </p><p>Kachin State and Mandalay Division between NLD supporters and </p><p>protesters. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) As yet, the NLD has not yet been able to provide its </p><p>version of these latest events.  Earlier in the week, </p><p>however, the NLD\'s U Lwin had described the clashes in Kachin </p><p>State and Mandalay Division as having been provoked by regime </p><p>supporters, who physically threatened Aung San Suu Kyi and </p><p>her party. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) We do not have the full story yet on the events in </p><p>Sagaing, but this may be the beginning of a new government </p><p>crackdown on the NLD.  There have been rumors in Rangoon for </p><p>several days that June was to be the month in which the </p><p>government brought the NLD to heel. The events in Sagaing may </p><p>be the start of that campaign. End Comment. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
