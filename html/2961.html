(U) SUMMARY:  THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IN VIETNAM HAS SEEN A </p><p>NUMBER OF IMPROVEMENTS IN THE LAST TEN YEARS, BUT IS SEEKING </p><p>MORE, ACCORDING TO CARDINAL TUNG, ARCHBISHOP OF HANOI.  THE </p><p>GVN HAS MADE IT EASIER FOR THE CHURCH TO RECRUIT AND TRAIN </p><p>NEW PRIESTS AND TRANSFER PRIESTS FROM PLACE TO PLACE, BUT </p><p>THE CATHOLIC CHURCH STILL NEEDS MANY MORE PRIESTS.  SOME OF </p><p>THE CHURCH\'S CURRENT PROBLEMS ARE WITH LOCAL AUTHORITIES, </p><p>NOT NATIONAL.  ACCORDING TO THE CARDINAL, THE GVN RECOGNIZED </p><p>THAT RELIGION WAS A BASIC NEED OF THE PEOPLE AND THAT THERE </p><p>WERE FEWER SOCIAL PROBLEMS IN AREAS WITH MANY RELIGIOUS </p><p>BELIEVERS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  THE AMBASSADOR, TOGETHER WITH DCM AND EMBOFFS, </p><p>MADE HIS FIRST CALL ON PAUL JOSEPH CARDINAL PHAM DINH TUNG, </p><p>ALSO ARCHBISHOP OF HANOI, AT THE ARCHBISHOP\'S HOUSE IN HANOI </p><p>ON MAY 15.  (NOTE:  THIS IS THE FIRST TIME CARDINAL TUNG HAS </p><p>MET EMBOFFS SINCE OCTOBER 1, 2001 -- REF A -- APPARENTLY DUE </p><p>TO HEALTH REASONS. END NOTE)  WHILE ACKNOWLEDGING PROGRESS </p><p>IN RECENT YEARS, THE CARDINAL SAID THAT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH </p><p>WANTS MANY MORE IMPROVEMENTS IN ITS SITUATION.  WHILE THE </p><p>CHURCH DESIRES MORE PRIESTS, CARDINAL TUNG HIGHLIGHTED THAT </p><p>THERE ARE NOW ALMOST 3000 PRIESTS IN VIETNAM, WHICH HE </p><p>DESCRIBED AS "A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE."  THE CARDINAL ALSO </p><p>STATED THAT IT IS NOW EASIER TO TRANSFER PRIESTS, EVEN </p><p>BETWEEN REGIONS, AND THAT IT HAS BECOME EASIER TO RECRUIT </p><p>SEMINARIANS.  HOWEVER, THE CHURCH IS LOOKING FOR ADDITIONAL </p><p>IMPROVEMENTS ON ALL OF THESE ISSUES.  MANY MORE PRIESTS ARE </p><p>NEEDED, THE CARDINAL EMPHASIZED, AND THE CATHOLIC CHURCH </p><p>WOULD LIKE TO BRING IN NEW SEMINARIANS EVERY YEAR, RATHER </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  01256  01 OF 02  170746Z </p><p>THAN EVERY OTHER YEAR AS THE GVN CURRENTLY ALLOWS.  (NOTE: </p><p>OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS THE PACE OF SEMINARY ADMISSIONS HAS </p><p>QUICKENED FROM ONCE IN FIVE YEARS, TO THREE YEARS, TO THE </p><p>CURRENT TWO YEARS.  END NOTE.)   MORE PRIESTS ARE NEEDED NOT </p><p>JUST TO SAY MASS, BUT ALSO TO CARRY OUT SOCIAL </p><p>RESPONSIBILITIES AND PUBLISH JOURNALS, AMONG OTHER DUTIES, </p><p>THE CARDINAL ADDED. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  THE CARDINAL STATED THAT THE NUMBER OF CATHOLIC </p><p>BELIEVERS HAS INCREASED SUBSTANTIALLY OVER THE LAST SEVERAL </p><p>YEARS, BUT THAT THE NUMBER WAS INCREASING MORE SLOWLY AMONG </p><p>THE YOUTH.  (NOTE:  THE NUMBER OF VIETNAMESE CATHOLICS IS </p><p>GENERALLY THOUGHT TO BE IN EXCESS OF SIX MILLION.  END </p><p>NOTE.)  HE ATTRIBUTED THE INCREASE TO: MARRIAGE INTO THE </p><p>CHURCH; INDIVIDUALS SEARCHING FOR "DIVINE TRUTH"; AND, </p><p>FRIENDSHIP.  THE ATTITUDE OF "INTELLECTUALS" TOWARDS THE </p><p>CHURCH HAS ALSO IMPROVED, CARDINAL TUNG CLAIMED.  THE CHURCH </p><p>HAS BEEN ABLE TO SUPPORT THE INCREASING NUMBER OF BELIEVERS </p><p>THROUGH CATECHISM, HE SAID, AND ALSO BECAUSE THE GVN HAS </p><p>ALLOWED THE CHURCH TO PRINT AND DISSEMINATE INFORMATION MORE </p><p>WIDELY. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  THE AMBASSADOR NOTED THAT THERE ARE CONSTRAINTS </p><p>ON RELIGION IN VIETNAM, BUT THAT INDIVIDUALS ARE GENERALLY </p><p>ABLE TO WORSHIP FREELY, WITH PAGODAS, CHURCHES, AND </p><p>TRADITIONAL TEMPLES FILLED WITH PEOPLE.  THE CARDINAL </p><p>REMARKED THAT THE VIETNAMESE ARE A SPIRITUAL PEOPLE, A </p><p>CHARACTERISTIC THAT GIVES CATHOLICS CONFIDENCE TO SPREAD </p><p>THEIR BELIEF.  HE STATED THAT THE TRADITION OF PAYING </p><p>RESPECT TO ONE\'S ANCESTORS WAS IMPORTANT IN CREATING FAITH- </p><p>BASED THINKING.  IN RESPONSE TO THE AMBASSADOR\'S QUESTION, </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  01256  01 OF 02  170746Z </p><p>THE CARDINAL ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH ACCEPTED </p><p>TRADITIONAL VIETNAMESE FOLK PRACTICES SUCH AS PAYING RESPECT </p><p>TO ANCESTORS.  THE CHURCH ALSO HAS WORKING LEVEL CONTACTS </p><p>WITH OTHER LEGALLY RECOGNIZED RELIGIONS, FOR INSTANCE </p><p>COOPERATING WITH PROTESTANTS TO PRINT BIBLES. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  ACCORDING TO THE CARDINAL, THE GVN, OVER THE LAST </p><p>TEN YEARS, HAS DEVELOPED A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE </p><p>CHURCH\'S POSITIVE INFLUENCE ON SOCIAL ISSUES.  HE CITED THE </p><p>CHURCH\'S ROLE IN POVERTY AND HUNGER REDUCTION AS WELL AS </p><p>FIGHTING SOCIAL VICES.  HE SAID THAT GVN OFFICIALS HAD TOLD </p><p>HIM THAT THEY HAD NOTICED LESS CRIME IN AREAS WITH MANY </p><p>RELIGIOUS BELIEVERS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  SOME OF THE REMAINING PROBLEMS THE CARDINAL </p><p>BROUGHT UP ARE WITH SOME LOCAL, NOT NATIONAL, AUTHORITIES. </p><p>IT IS EASIER FOR THE CHURCH TO CARRY OUT SOCIAL SERVICES IN </p><p>SOUTHERN VIETNAM, HE NOTED.  WHILE MANY WOMEN HAD BECOME </p><p>NUNS IN RECENT YEARS, THEY FACED "PROBLEMS" IN OTHER PLACES, </p><p>HE ADMITTED.  (NOTE:  BY LAW, PROVINCIAL PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE </p><p>CHAIRMEN AUTHORIZE ENTRY INTO RELIGIOUS ORDERS.  REF B </p><p>DESCRIBES THE PROBLEMS OF WOULD-BE NUNS IN DANANG.

(SBU)  REGARDING VATICAN RELATIONS, THE CARDINAL (WHO </p><p>SPENT SEVERAL WEEKS IN ROME WITH SEVERAL OTHER VIETNAMESE </p><p>BISHOPS EARLIER THIS YEAR) SAID THAT THE POPE TOLD THEM THAT </p><p>MANY OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH\'S ISSUES IN VIETNAM WOULD BE </p><p>SOLVED THROUGH "DIALOGUE."  THE CARDINAL SAID THAT HE HAD </p><p>APPLIED TO THE GVN FOR A PAPAL VISIT THREE OR FOUR YEARS </p><p>AGO, BUT THE GVN HAD REPLIED THAT IT NEEDED MORE TIME "TO </p><p>PREPARE PROPERLY FOR THE VISIT OF SUCH AN IMPORTANT </p><p>INTERNATIONAL FIGURE."  THERE ARE STILL NO FORMAL RELATIONS </p><p>BETWEEN THE VATICAN AND THE GVN.  (HIS AIDES SUBSEQUENTLY </p><p>POINTED TO THE SITE OF THE ONE-TIME RESIDENCE OF THE PAPAL </p><p>NUNCIO, ADJACENT TO THE ARCHBISHOP\'S HOUSE; THE RESIDENCE </p><p>HAS BEEN TORN DOWN, THE SITE EXPROPRIATED, AND PLANS </p><p>DEVELOPED TO BUILD AN ENTERTAINMENT COMPLEX, THEY CLAIMED.) </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
