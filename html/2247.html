<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L  HARARE 003597 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL. 11/29/11 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MDC WILL NOT BOYCOTT PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY POLITICAL SECTION CHIEF MATT HARRINGTON. </p><p>REASONS: 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) MDC LEADER MORGAN TSVANGIRAI TOLD THE AMBASSADOR ON </p><p>NOVEMBER 27 THAT RAMPANT MANIPULATION OF THE ELECTORAL PROCESS AND </p><p>INTENSIFYING VIOLENCE AGAINST OPPOSITION SUPPORTERS CONFIRM THAT </p><p>THE RULING PARTY IS PREPARED TO WIN THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION BY </p><p>ANY MEANS.  DESPITE THE UNLIKELY PROSPECTS FOR A FREE AND FAIR </p><p>VOTE, THE MDC WOULD NOT BOYCOTT, AS "PEOPLE HAVE SACRIFICED TOO </p><p>MUCH."  TSVANGIRAI SAID INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS SHOULD BE IN PLACE </p><p>AT LEAST SIX WEEKS BEFORE THE ELECTION IN ORDER TO CONDUCT A </p><p>CREDIBLE ASSESSMENT AND HE WOULD EMPHASIZE THIS POINT WITH AF </p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY KANSTEINER IN THE LATTER\'S UPCOMING VISIT TO </p><p>ZIMBABWE.  THE MDC LEADER CONFIRMED THAT HIS PARTY AND ZANU-PF </p><p>REMAIN ENGAGED IN "VERY LOW-KEY, EXPLORATORY" TALKS FOCUSED NOT ON </p><p>POWER-SHARING BUT ON HOW TO RESTORE NORMALITY TO THE COUNTRY. </p><p>TSVANGIRAI EXPRESSED HOPE THAT THE ZIMBABWE DEMOCRACY AND </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>ECONOMIC RECOVERY ACT WOULD PASS SOON.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>USG POSITION </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) IN A NOVEMBER 27 CONVERSATION WITH MDC PRESIDENT MORGAN </p><p>TSVANGIRAI IN THE OPPOSITION LEADER\'S OFFICE, THE AMBASSADOR, </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>ACCOMPANIED BY POLITICAL SECTION CHIEF, CONVEYED THE USG POSITION </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03597  010817Z </p><p>THAT CONDITIONS DO NOT NOW EXIST IN ZIMBABWE FOR FREE AND FAIR </p><p>ELECTIONS.  IT WAS OUR VIEW, HOWEVER, THAT THERE IS STILL TIME TO </p><p>CREATE THOSE CONDITIONS, AND THE UNITED STATES WANTED TO BE </p><p>HELPFUL IN THAT PROCESS IF POSSIBLE.  THE AMBASSADOR SAID WE WOULD </p><p>CONTINUE TO PRESS THE IMPORTANCE OF ADMITTING INTERNATIONAL </p><p>OBSERVERS AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE.  HE REPORTED THAT AF ASSISTANT </p><p>SECRETARY KANSTEINER WOULD BE IN ZIMBABWE DECEMBER 8-11 AND HOPED </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>TO BE ABLE TO MEET WITH TSVANGIRAI.  THE AMBASSADOR THEN SOLICITED </p><p>THE OPPOSITION LEADER\'S ASSESSMENT OF RECENT POLITICAL </p><p>DEVELOPMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>ELECTORAL MACHINATIONS </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) THE GOZ, TSVANGIRAI BEGAN, IS DETERMINED TO WIN THE </p><p>ELECTION USING ALL MEANS, AND WANTS TO ENSURE A PREDETERMINED </p><p>OUTCOME.  MANIPULATION OF THE ELECTORAL PROCESS IS RAMPANT, AS </p><p>GOVERNMENT SEEKS TO DISENFRANCHISE LARGE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE.  THE </p><p>MDC, HE SAID, PLANNED THE FOLLOWING DAY TO FILE SUIT CHALLENGING </p><p>THE ONEROUS REQUIREMENTS BEING IMPOSED ON ZIMBABWEANS WHO ARE </p><p>TRYING TO REGISTER TO VOTE.  THAT MORNING, HE SAID, HIS 18 YEAR- </p><p>OLD DAUGHTER HAD INITIALLY BEEN TURNED AWAY WHEN SHE WENT TO </p><p>REGISTER, TOLD EITHER TO PRODUCE PROOF OF RESIDENCE OR TO BRING </p><p>HER FATHER TO THE OFFICE.  THE ELECTORAL OFFICIAL ONLY RELENTED </p><p>UNDER PRESSURE FROM THE GIRL\'S BODYGUARDS.  "IF THIS CAN HAPPEN TO </p><p>MY DAUGHTER IN HARARE," TSVANGIRAI ASSERTED, "IMAGINE WHAT IS </p><p>HAPPENING IN ISOLATED RURAL AREAS." </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) THE ELECTORAL SUPERVISORY COMMISSION (ESC), TSVANGIRAI </p><p>LAMENTED, HAS NOT PERFORMED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW.  IT IS </p><p>SUPPOSED TO ENSURE THAT THE ELECTORAL PROCESS IS CARRIED OUT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03597  010817Z </p><p>FAIRLY AND CONSISTENT WITH LAID-DOWN RULES, BUT MUCH OF ITS </p><p>AUTHORITY HAS BEEN USURPED BY THE REGISTRAR-GENERAL.  TSVANGIRAI </p><p>DESCRIBED THE REGISTRAR-GENERAL, TOBAIWA MUDEDE, AS A ZANU-PF </p><p>PARTISAN, WHO ACTS LIKE A REFEREE WHO THROWS AWAY HIS WHISTLE AND </p><p>JOINS ONE TEAM.  ASKED WHETHER THE MDC HAS ACCESS TO THE ELECTORAL </p><p>SUPERVISORY COMMISSION (ESC), TSVANGIRAI SAID THE PARTY\'S </p><p>ELECTIONS DIRECTOR WAS SEEKING A MEETING WITH ESC CHAIRMAN SOBUSA </p><p>GULA-NDEBELE.  HE DISMISSED THE ESC MEMBERS AS "ZANU-PF ZEALOTS" </p><p>BUT THOUGHT GULA-NDEBELE\'S BACKGROUND AS A LAWYER MIGHT MAKE HIM </p><p>MORE MODERATE THAN HIS COLLEAGUES.  THE AMBASSADOR ENCOURAGED THE </p><p>MDC TO MEET WITH THE REGISTRAR-GENERAL AS WELL.  TSVANGIRAI AGREED </p><p>IT WAS IMPORTANT TO TRY.  THE BOTTOM LINE, THOUGH, IS THAT </p><p>ZIMBABWEANS DO NOT HAVE A NON-PARTISAN BODY MONITORING THE </p><p>ELECTION PROCESS. HE SAID THE MDC MIGHT PROPOSE IN ITS INTER-PARTY </p><p>DIALOGUE WITH ZANU-PF (SEE PARA 8 BELOW) FORMATION OF AN ELECTORAL </p><p>COMMISSION COMPRISING BOTH RULING PARTY AND MDC REPRESENTATIVES, A </p><p>STEP THAT COULD OBVIATE THE NEED IN THE SHORT-TERM FOR AN </p><p>INDEPENDENT ELECTORAL BODY. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) TSVANGIRAI RAISED THE ISSUE OF INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS, </p><p>SAYING THE MDC ASSESSMENT WAS THAT OBSERVER GROUPS NEEDED TO BE IN </p><p>PLACE AT LEAST SIX WEEKS IN ADVANCE OF THE ELECTION IN ORDER TO DO </p><p>A CREDIBLE ASSESSMENT.  HE SAID HE WOULD SHARE THAT VIEW WITH A/S </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 HARARE 003597 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 05        HARARE  03597  010817Z </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL. 11/29/11 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MDC WILL NOT BOYCOTT PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION </p><p> </p><p>KANSTEINER DURING THE LATTER\'S VISIT TO ZIMBABWE.  ASKED WHETHER </p><p>THE MDC HAS THE CAPACITY TO ASSIGN ITS OWN PARTY AGENTS TO EVERY </p><p>POLLING STATION, TSVANGIRAI SAID THEY HAVE ENOUGH PEOPLE.  THE </p><p>PROBLEM IS THAT, IN ISOLATED AREAS, THE PARTY AGENTS ARE VERY </p><p>VULNERABLE AND "TAKE LOTS OF ABUSE." </p><p> </p><p>MORE VIOLENCE BUT BOYCOTT NOT AN OPTION </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) ACCORDING TO TSVANGIRAI, THE GOZ HAS STEPPED UP ITS </p><p>INTIMIDATION CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE MDC "BY LABELING US TERRORISTS." </p><p>HE INSISTED THAT THE MDC HAD HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE CAIN NKALA </p><p>MURDER, WHICH WAS LIKELY AN INSIDE JOB.  NONETHELESS, THAT </p><p>UNFORTUNATE INCIDENT WAS BEING USED AS A PRETEXT BY THE GOZ AND </p><p>ZANU-PF TO CRACK DOWN ON THE OPPOSITION PARTY.  THE GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>CASE WAS UNRAVELING, HOWEVER, AS TWO KEY WITNESSES IN THE CASE HAD </p><p>TOLD JOURNALISTS THEIR "CONFESSIONS" HAD BEEN ERRONEOUS AND </p><p>EXTRACTED UNDER TORTURE.  ACCORDING TO TSVANGIRAI, SIX MDC </p><p>SUPPORTERS HELD IN THE CASE HAD BEEN RELEASED, LEAVING ONLY FIVE </p><p>OR SIX STILL UNDER DETENTION.  HE EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT ZANU-PF </p><p>SUPPORTERS ARE NOW GOING HOUSE-TO-HOUSE BEATING MDC SUPPORTERS IN </p><p>CHEGUTU, A TOWN 100 KM SOUTHWEST OF HARARE WHICH IS DUE TO HOLD A </p><p>MAYORAL ELECTION DECEMBER 8-9. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) TSVANGIRAI SAID SOME HAVE URGED THE MDC TO BOYCOTT NEXT </p><p>YEAR\'S ELECTION, SINCE CURRENT CONDITIONS WOULD PRECLUDE A FREE </p><p>AND FAIR VOTE.  TSVANGIRAI REJECTED THE SUGGESTION OUT OF HAND, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 06        HARARE  03597  010817Z </p><p>SAYING A BOYCOTT IS NOT EVEN BEING CONSIDERED.  HE SAID THE MDC </p><p>WOULD COMPETE EVEN IF IT HAS TO LIMP INTO THE ELECTION.  "PEOPLE </p><p>HAVE SACRIFICED TOO MUCH FOR US TO DO OTHERWISE," TSVANGIRAI </p><p>DECLARED. </p><p> </p><p>INTER-PARTY DIALOGUE </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) ACCORDING TO TSVANGIRAI, ZANU-PF AND THE MDC REMAIN </p><p>ENGAGED IN "EXPLORATORY" ATTEMPTS AT INTER-PARTY DIALOGUE.  THE </p><p>TALKS ARE "VERY LOW-KEY" AND HAVE NOT EVEN BEEN BROUGHT TO THE </p><p>ATTENTION OF HIS OWN NATIONAL PARTY EXECUTIVE.  HE EMPHASIZED THAT </p><p>THESE DISCUSSIONS ARE NOT ABOUT POWER-SHARING BUT ABOUT HOW TO </p><p>RETURN THE COUNTRY TO NORMALITY.  TSVANGIRAI SAID THE MDC HAS TOLD </p><p>ZANU-PF VIA THIS CHANNEL THAT AN ELECTORAL CODE OF CONDUCT IS </p><p>IMPERATIVE AND THAT, IF THERE IS AGREEMENT ON SUCH A DOCUMENT, THE </p><p>MDC WOULD BE WILLING TO CONSIDER A DELAY IN THE ELECTION.  ASKED </p><p>WHETHER THE MDC WOULD JOIN ZANU-PF IN APPEALING FOR CALM AND AN </p><p>END TO THE VIOLENCE, TSVANGIRAI SAID HE WOULD DO SO </p><p>"ENTHUSIASTICALLY."  THE MDC, HE ASSERTED, HAS ACTED AS A </p><p>"RESTRAINING FACTOR" IN ZIMBABWE\'S CHARGED ATMOSPHERE BECAUSE THE </p><p>PARTY IS COMMITTED TO "PEACEFUL DEMOCRATIC DISCOURSE."  THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR REMARKED THAT ANY PROGRESS IN THIS CHANNEL WOULD BE A </p><p>POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT AND SAID THE USG WAS PREPARED TO BE HELPFUL </p><p>IN ANY WAY IT COULD. </p><p> </p><p>CAMPAIGNING </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR ASKED WHETHER TSVANGIRAI IS ABLE TO MOVE </p><p>FREELY AROUND THE COUNTRY.  TSVANGIRAI REPLIED THAT HE HAD </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 07        HARARE  03597  010817Z </p><p>ADDRESSED TWO RALLIES THE WEEKEND BEFORE NEAR CHIREDZI, IN </p><p>SOUTHEASTERN ZIMBABWE, AND HE HAD NOT EXPERIENCED ANY SERIOUS </p><p>PROBLEMS.  POLICE WERE IN ATTENDANCE, BUT THEY CONSTITUTED MORE OF </p><p>A THREATENING PRESENCE THAN A PROTECTIVE ONE.  TSVANGIRAI SAID HE </p><p>DOES NOT ENJOY THE SAME FREEDOM IN MASHONALAND CENTRAL, A PROVINCE </p><p>WHICH IS LARGELY A NO-GO AREA FOR THE MDC.  INSTEAD OF HOLDING </p><p>LARGE RALLIES THERE, THE PARTY BRINGS ITS SUPPORTERS FOR TRAINING </p><p>TO HARARE, THEN SENDS THEM BACK TO ENGAGE IN DISCREET DOOR-TO-DOOR </p><p>CAMPAIGNING, PRIMARILY WITH FRIENDS AND FAMILY. </p><p> </p><p>ZDERA </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) THE MDC LEADER EXPRESSED HIS HOPE THAT THE ZIMBABWE </p><p>DEMOCRACY AND ECONOMIC RECOVERY ACT (ZDERA) WOULD BE PASSED SOON. </p><p>THE AMBASSADOR REPLIED THAT RECENT POLITICAL EVENTS HAVE LIKELY </p><p>INCREASED THE INCLINATION OF THE U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES TO </p><p>MOVE FORWARD QUICKLY ON THIS LEGISLATION. (NOTE: ZDERA WAS </p><p>APPROVED BY THE HOUSE INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS COMMITTEE THE </p><p>FOLLOWING DAY.  END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) TSVANGIRAI SEEMED TIRED -- LIKELY A RESULT OF </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S INTENSIFIED CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE MDC OVER THE LAST </p><p>SEVERAL WEEKS -- BUT HE REMAINED UPBEAT.  HE WAS CLEARLY </p><p>DETERMINED TO CONTEST THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION NO MATTER HOW MUCH </p><p>PRESSURE HE AND HIS PARTY ARE SUBJECTED TO.  TSVANGIRAI\'S POINT </p><p>ABOUT THE SACRIFICES MADE TO DATE BY THE MDC\'S SUPPORTERS IS SPOT </p><p>ON, BUT HE ALSO REALIZES THAT THIS IS A POLITICALLY SAVVY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 08        HARARE  03597  010817Z </p><p>POSITION.  MANY ZIMBABWEANS ARE ANXIOUS TO CAST VOTES IN THE </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION AND WANT AN ALTERNATIVE TO MUGABE ON THE </p><p>BALLOT; TSVANGIRAI WOULD NEVER BE FORGIVEN BY HIS SUPPORTERS IF HE </p><p>WITHDREW FROM THE RACE OR IF THE PARTY OPTED OUT ON ELECTION DAY. </p><p>WE FOUND ODD HIS EXPRESSED WILLINGNESS TO CONSIDER A DELAY IN THE </p><p>ELECTION IF MDC AND ZANU-PF AGREE ON AN ELECTORAL CODE OF CONDUCT, </p><p>AS WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE CONSTITUTION PERMITS NO FLEXIBILITY FOR </p><p>POSTPONING THE ELECTION BEYOND MARCH 31, 2002.  IT IS GOOD THAT </p><p>ZANU-PF AND THE MDC CONTINUE TO TALK, AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO </p><p>ENCOURAGE SUCH A DIALOGUE, BUT OUR EXPECTATIONS ARE NOT HIGH. </p><p>THEIR SECRET DISCUSSIONS HAVE BEEN ONGOING FOR MORE THAN A YEAR, </p><p>AND THE FACT THAT THEY REMAIN "EXPLORATORY" AND "VERY LOW-KEY" </p><p>DOES NOT PROVIDE MUCH HOPE FOR A BREAKTHROUGH. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
