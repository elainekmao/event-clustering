There has been an outpouring of articles, op-ed and </p><p>      opinion pieces in the mainstream newspapers </p><p>      following talks on Zimbabwe between President George </p><p>      W. Bush and his South African counterpart Thabo </p><p>      Mbeki, including President Bush\'s visit to Botswana, </p><p>      in the leading newspapers published on July 11. </p><p>      Excerpts of the articles follow: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   Under headline "Bush\'s statement a shift in U. S. </p><p>      policy? the government-controlled daily "Chronicle" </p><p>      (07/11) carried the following op-ed by Kennedy </p><p>      Mavhumasha on page 4: </p><p> </p><p>      "United States President, George W. Bush this week </p><p>      performed a quick climb-down from his earlier anti- </p><p>      Zimbabwe rhetoric, but analysts say he must now </p><p>      match his public statements with practical measures </p><p>      to normalize diplomatic relations with Harare. . </p><p>      .But political analysts interviewed. . .yesterday </p><p>      were quick to point out that the government should </p><p>      give it time, as the U. S. President\'s words might </p><p>      fail to translate into a shift in his country\'s </p><p>      policy towards Zimbabwe. . .Dr. Godfrey Chikowore, a </p><p>      University of Zimbabwe international relations </p><p>      lecturer said: `The change is welcome but we want to </p><p>      see if the statement was one of principle and not </p><p>      just a matter of buying time. . .It will be unwise </p><p>      for us to bank on statements and promises.  Let us </p><p>      give him time. . .\'  A lecturer at the National </p><p>      University of Science and Technology, Dr. Lawton </p><p>      Hikwa, said: `It is difficult to say at the moment </p><p>      but there is a significant appreciation that </p><p>      whatever Mr. Bush has heard about the situation here </p><p>      was exaggerated.  Perhaps as time goes on, we could </p><p>      see some objectivity. . . .\'" </p><p> </p><p>  3.   Under headline "Visit gives Bush rude awakening" the </p><p>      government-controlled daily "The Herald" (07/11) </p><p>      carried the following analysis by Lovemore Mataire </p><p>      on page 9: </p><p> </p><p>      "United States President Mr. George W. Bush\'s image </p><p>      making visit to Africa suffered a major setback when </p><p>      he openly expressed confidence in South African </p><p>      President Mr. Thabo Mbeki\'s mediation in Zimbabwe. </p><p>      Mr. Bush\'s statements were in sharp contrast to his </p><p>      and that of his Secretary of State Mr. Collin (sic) </p><p>      Powell\'s earlier statements urging South Africa to </p><p>      exert more pressure on Zimbabwe to have a </p><p>      transitional arrangement in place. . .Mr. Bush\'s </p><p>      endorsement of Mr. Mbeki as an `honest broker\' in </p><p>      Zimbabwe fell short of admitting that he had been </p><p>      misled about the real situation prevailing in the </p><p>      country. . .Cautious of not treading on unpopular </p><p>      track, Mr. Bush found himself with no option but to </p><p>      back down from his previous hard-line stance towards </p><p>      President Mugabe. . .But Mr. Bush\'s public support </p><p>      for Mbeki\'s Zimbabwe policy appeared to mark a </p><p>      personal defeat for (Morgan) Tsvangirai (MDC </p><p>      leader), who has criticized the South African leader </p><p>      for `choosing to be in solidarity with a </p><p>      dictator. . . .\'" </p><p> </p><p>  4.   Under headline "Where will Tsvangirai turn to now?" </p><p>      the independent daily "The Daily News" (07/11) carried the </p><p>      following opinion piece by Kuthula Matshazi, who is based </p><p>      in Toronto, Canada, on page 10: </p><p> </p><p>      "South African President Thabo Mbeki\'s words are </p><p>      coming back to haunt us.  The resolution of </p><p>      Zimbabwe\'s problems lies squarely with Zimbabweans. </p><p>      United States President George W. Bush implicitly </p><p>      endorsed this view when he met with Mbeki on </p><p>      Wednesday in South Africa. . .Where will Tsvangirai </p><p>      turn to now that Bush has embraced Mbeki\'s position? </p><p>      In other words, Bush has told Tsvangirai to deal </p><p>      with Mbeki. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>  5.   Under headline "MDC leader bows to Uncle Sam\'s might" </p><p>      the government-controlled daily "Chronicle" (07/11) carried </p><p>      the following article on page one: </p><p> </p><p>      "Opposition MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai was </p><p>      yesterday forced to withdraw `angry\' remarks he made </p><p>      against President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa after </p><p>      the United States endorsed Pretoria\'s quiet </p><p>      diplomacy on Zimbabwe.  Tsvangirai. . .back-tracked </p><p>      on his earlier outburst in which he accused Mbeki of </p><p>      being `mischievous\' and trying to `buy time\' for the </p><p>      Zimbabwe government.  His climb-down came following </p><p>      the announcement by President George W. Bush that </p><p>      the U. S. was now of `one mind\' with South Africa </p><p>      and would leave Mbeki the task of helping resolve </p><p>      Zimbabwe\'s challenges. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>  6.   Under headline "Botswana backs Zim: `. . .no need for </p><p>      outsiders to interfere in Zimbabwe\'s problem\'s\'" the lead </p><p>      article in the government-controlled daily "The Herald" </p><p>      (07.11) reads: </p><p> </p><p>      "Botswana sees no need for outsiders to interfere in </p><p>      the problems affecting Zimbabwe.  Minister of </p><p>      Foreign Affairs Mr. Mombati Merafe said soon after </p><p>      the meeting between President George Bush. . .and </p><p>      President Festus Mogae of Botswana that Zimbabwe was </p><p>      a sovereign state with a government which came into </p><p>      place through a legitimate process adding that the </p><p>      situation in the country required persuasion and </p><p>      that no one should dictate what should be done.  Mr. </p><p>      Merafe stressed that the position of Zimbabwe has </p><p>      not changed and the visit by the U. S. President to </p><p>      Botswana and the region in general would not change, </p><p>      alter or influence the cordial bilateral relations </p><p>      between Zimbabwe and Botswana.  The U. S. President </p><p>      yesterday expressed satisfaction and concurred with </p><p>      President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa\'s policy of </p><p>      quiet diplomacy on Zimbabwe. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
