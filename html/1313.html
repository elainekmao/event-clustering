IRVING. </p><p>REASONS: 1.5 (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) ACTION REQUEST.  PLEASE SEE PARA 5. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) IN AN EXTRAORDINARY GOVERNMENT GAZETTE PUBLISHED </p><p>OCTOBER 6, PRESIDENT MUGABE GRANTED A PARDON "TO EVERY </p><p>PERSON LIABLE TO CRIMINAL PROSECUTION FOR ANY </p><p>POLITICALLY-MOTIVATED CRIME" COMMITTED BETWEEN JANUARY 1 </p><p>AND JULY 31, 2000.  THE PARDON SPECIFICALLY APPLIES TO </p><p>POLITICAL CRIMES COMMITTED IN CONNECTION WITH THE </p><p>FEBRUARY CONSTITUTIONAL REFERENDUM AND THE JUNE </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS.  CURIOUSLY, "SPECIFIED </p><p>OFFENSES," NAMELY MURDER, ROBBERY, RAPE, INDECENT </p><p>ASSAULT, THEFT, POSSESSION OF ARMS, AND ANY OFFENSE </p><p>INVOLVING FRAUD OR DISHONESTY, ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE </p><p>PARDON.  HOWEVER, COMMON ASSAULT, KIDNAPPING, </p><p>MANSLAUGHTER, AND ASSAULT WITH INTENT TO COMMIT GRIEVOUS </p><p>BODILY HARM (WHICH IS MOST OFTEN USED IN TORTURE CASES), </p><p>AMONG OTHER UNSPECIFIED CRIMES COMMITTED DURING THAT </p><p>PERIOD, ARE EXEMPTED.  THE AMNESTY COVERS THE VAST </p><p>MAJORITY OF POLITICAL VIOLENCE CASES ARISING DURING THE </p><p>PRE-ELECTION PERIOD, ACCORDING TO TONY REELER, DIRECTOR </p><p>OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS ORGANIZATION AMANI TRUST. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  05692  101517Z </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) REELER FURTHER REMARKED THAT THE PARDON WILL </p><p>FORCE HIS ORGANIZATION TO PURSUE ITS MYRIAD HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>CASES THROUGH THE MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE CIVIL COURTS, </p><p>RATHER THAN THE CRIMINAL COURTS.  THE MOVE ALSO CASTS </p><p>SERIOUS DOUBT ON THE MDC\'S ABILITY TO PURSUE ITS LEGAL </p><p>CHALLENGES TO THE VOTING RESULTS IN 37 CONSTITUENCIES, </p><p>MOST OF WHICH ARE BASED ON CHARGES OF POLITICAL </p><p>INTIMIDATION.  THE PARDON HAD NOT BEEN REPORTED IN THE </p><p>LOCAL MEDIA OVER THE WEEKEND, BUT THE TRUSTEES OF THE </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS NGO, LEGAL RESOURCES FOUNDATION (LRF), </p><p>CIRCULATED A STATEMENT OCTOBER 10 CONDEMNING THE PARDON </p><p>AS "COMPLETE CONTEMPT FOR THE RULE OF LAW."  THE LRF </p><p>SAID THE AMNESTY SENDS "THE CLEAR MESSAGE THAT CRIMES </p><p>COMMITTED IN SUPPORT OF THE RULING PARTY WILL GO </p><p>UNPUNISHED." </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) COMMENT: THE LANGUAGE OF MUGABE\'S CLEMENCY ORDER </p><p>WOULD APPEAR TO LEAVE SOME ROOM OPEN FOR PROSECUTORS TO </p><p>TRY THE MOST EGREGIOUS OF THE HANDFUL OF POLITICAL </p><p>VIOLENCE CASES NOW BEFORE THE COURTS.  HOWEVER, IT WILL </p><p>UNDOUBTEDLY DISCOURAGE ANY PROSECUTOR FROM PURSUING THE </p><p>THOUSANDS OF SERIOUS CRIMINAL CASES THAT HAVE YET TO SEE </p><p>THE LIGHT OF A COURTROOM.  MUGABE CLEARLY INTENDS TO </p><p>PROTECT THOSE WHO CARRIED OUT HIS DIRTY DEEDS DURING THE </p><p>PRE-ELECTION PERIOD, AND HIS AMNESTY IS A CYNICAL </p><p>ATTEMPT TO WHITEWASH HIS CAMPAIGN OF TERROR WITH </p><p>LEGALITIES.  IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE PARDON WAS </p><p>QUIETLY SLIPPED INTO THE GAZETTE ON THE EVE OF THE </p><p>ADJOURNMENT OF THE U.S. CONGRESS AND THE DEATH IN </p><p>COMMITTEE OF THE ZIMBABWE DEMOCRACY ACT.  HOME AFFAIRS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  05692  101517Z </p><p>MINISTER JOHN NKOMO APPEARS TO HAVE HINTED AT THIS </p><p>AMNESTY WHEN HE MADE HIS RECENT REMARK, IN RELATION TO </p><p>THE SHUTTING DOWN OF THE PRIVATE CAPITAL RADIO STATION, </p><p>THAT "THESE DAYS OF RUNNING TO THE COURTS WILL END SOON, </p><p>VERY SOON."  (REFTEL). </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) ACTION REQUEST: IT IS OUR SENSE THAT THIS </p><p>AMNESTY VIOLATES HUMAN RIGHTS NORMS, AND POSSIBLY </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S COMMITMENTS UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW, AND IS </p><p>REPUGNANT TO THE SPIRIT IF NOT THE LETTER OF THE RULE OF </p><p>LAW.  WE REQUEST DEPARTMENT\'S LEGAL ASSESSMENT IN THIS </p><p>CONNECTION.   SHOULD THE DEPARTMENT CONFIRM OUR </p><p>CONCERNS, POST RECOMMENDS THAT THE USG APPROACH AND </p><p>LODGE A PROTEST WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE.  WE </p><p>WOULD APPRECIATE DEPARTMENT\'S GUIDANCE ON THE </p><p>APPROPRIATE LANGUAGE TO USE IN SUCH A DEMARCHE. </p><p> </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
