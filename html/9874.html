<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 001329 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/03/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PINR, PGOV, PREL, KDEM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCHES OF MEMBERS OF THE </p><p>NEW CABINET PART 1 </p><p> </p><p> CLASSIFIED BY CHARGE DAWN M.

In a novel twist, Obasanjo had forwarded the </p><p>roster to the National Assembly without matching the </p><p>prospective Ministers to any portfolios.  He only designated </p><p>the portfolios after the nominees had been confirmed.  The </p><p>Assembly approved all but one candidate, while Obasanjo </p><p>removed another from consideration.  Below are biographical </p><p>sketches of 11 ministers.  Bios on the remainder will be </p><p>transmitted septel.  Additionally, analysis of the selections </p><p>and of the unorthodox nomination process will also be treated </p><p>septel. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Ministry of Internal Affairs - Minister, Dr. Iyorchia </p><p>Ayu, was the former Minister of Industry (1999-2000), as well </p><p>as a former Minister of Education (1993-1995).  Ayu was </p><p>elected Senator in 1992 and was the Senate President until </p><p>November 1993 when impeached by pro-Interim National </p><p>Government Senators led by Chuba Okadigbo (most recently </p><p>Buhari,s ANPP running mate).  He was a member of the </p><p>now-defunct Social Democratic Party.  Prior to his political </p><p>roles, Ayu was a sociology professor for 24 years and an </p><p>editor at the Daily Times of Nigeria for 2 years.  Ayu is in </p><p>his mid-fifties and was influential in the PDP,s victories </p><p>in Benue State in the April elections.  He is the nominee of </p><p>PDP Chairman Audu Ogbeh and Benue State Governor David Akume. </p><p> Minister of State Abubakar Tanko was the Director of Yankari </p><p>National Park in Bauchi State, and is a longtime stalwart in </p><p>the PDP in Niger State. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Ministry of Foreign Affairs - Minister Olu Adeniji was </p><p>Ambassador to France (1987), Switzerland (1977-1981) and </p><p>Australia (1976-1977), UN Special Representative and Head of </p><p>the UN Mission to Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL), and Special </p><p>Representative for the UN Mission in the Central African </p><p>Republic (MINURCA).  He has also served in the Nigerian </p><p>Embassies in Washington, Freetown, Sierra Leone, and Accra. </p><p>He was a career diplomat for 31 years, retiring in 1992 after </p><p>serving as the Director-General of the MFA.  He is 69.  He is </p><p>from Ogun State and has a close relationship with Obasanjo. </p><p>Minister of State Saidu Balarabe Sambawa is a Hausa/Fulani </p><p>from Kebbi who was a failed PDP candidate for Governor in the </p><p>April elections.  He is a former banker and farmer and is </p><p>known as a grassroots politician in the state.

He is in his forties. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Ministry of Justice - Minister and Attorney General </p><p>Chief Akinlolu Olujinmi is a practicing Senior Advocate of </p><p>Nigeria (the highest professional ranking for an attorney) </p><p>and is well known within the PDP of Oyo State.  He is a </p><p>Yoruba who has held no previous political office. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Ministry of Information - Minister Chukweumeka Chikelu </p><p>was a Representative from Anambra State in the National </p><p>Assembly who was reelected in April.  In the House he headed </p><p>the Committee on Cooperation and Integration.

Minister of State Princess Funke </p><p>Adedoyin is the daughter of Kwara State business mogul Chief </p><p>Samuel Adedoyin.  She has held no office, but has very close </p><p>personal ties to the Sarakis of Kwara State and Vice </p><p>President Atiku. (NOTE: There are widespread rumors of an </p><p>actual affair between Adedoyin and the Vice President.  This </p><p>nomination is compensation from Governor Bukola Saraki for </p><p>not being chosen as his Deputy. END NOTE) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Ministry of Defense - Minister Dr. Rabiu Musa </p><p>Kwankwaso is the former governor of Kano who lost in April. </p><p>In his mid-forties, Kwankwaso,s experience is in water </p><p>resources, having worked in the sector for 17 years.

Obasanjo probably wanted </p><p>to give this relatively young, strong political ally a </p><p>prominent position so that he can remain in the public eye. </p><p>Minister of State Dr. Rowland Oritsejafor, an Itsekiri, was </p><p>the Deputy National Secretary of the PDP.  He is a medical </p><p>doctor and has close ties with Delta State Governor Ibori. </p><p>Also with no background in military affairs, his nomination </p><p>appears to be more a political than substantive consideration. </p><p>8.

His father is a prominent businessman in the North. </p><p> Nweke has a degree in Public Administration and at 34 is the </p><p>youngest person in the cabinet.
