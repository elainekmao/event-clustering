The issue of milling of the Australian-donated wheat has </p><p>yet to be resolved as WFP cannot proceed with milling until </p><p>the negotiations with OIP are completed.  Representatives of </p><p>the IRAC reported that documents have been completely looted </p><p>from GOI intelligence offices in Umm Qasr.  DART members met </p><p>for the second time with the newly designated village </p><p>council in Umm Qasr on 12 April.  A Coalition assessment of </p><p>the power situation in Najaf revealed that fuel consumption </p><p>at the power plant is much greater than earlier indicated. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>---- </p><p>FOOD </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p>2.  The first ship containing Australian-donated wheat, the </p><p>Pearl of Fujairah, is now berthed at Kuwait\'s commercial </p><p>port with 39,500 metric tons (MT), having offloaded 10,500 </p><p>MT at the military port.  The discharge of the wheat is </p><p>expected to take approximately five days.  The second ship, </p><p>the Andromedra, remains off the coast of Oman. </p><p> </p><p>3.  The World Food Program (WFP) is looking into milling </p><p>capacity in Iraq, as Kuwait\'s capacity is only 400 MT per </p><p>day.  Basrah\'s capacity was 1,600 MT per day, and the mill </p><p>in An Nasiriyah also appears functional.  The most likely </p><p>solution to the issue of milling the Australian wheat will </p><p>be some combination of Kuwaiti and Iraqi mills.  However, </p><p>WFP cannot proceed with milling until the negotiations </p><p>between the Office of Iraq Program (OIP) and WFP have been </p><p>completed. </p><p> </p><p>4.  The DART food team met with the newly arrived WFP Senior </p><p>Program Officer from the WFP/Iraq operation on 11 April.  An </p><p>additional eight to ten WFP program staff will be arriving </p><p>over the next week in Kuwait and will move into Iraq as soon </p><p>as security permits.  The DART discussed how to </p><p>appropriately balance the tasks of addressing immediate food </p><p>needs and reviving the public distribution system (PDS). </p><p>WFP\'s Senior Program Officer also traveled to Umm Qasr on 12 </p><p>April to meet with the assembled village leaders and food </p><p>agents. </p><p> </p><p>5.  DART and WFP held a second meeting with the Kuwait Red </p><p>Crescent Society (KRCS) on 11 April.  KRCS asked WFP for </p><p>guidance in conducting distributions.  Also discussed was </p><p>the possibility of the KRCS providing complementary </p><p>commodities to what WFP would be providing through the PDS, </p><p>such as canned meat or fish.  KRCS is very open to this and </p><p>has funding to make purchases. KRCS is also preparing to </p><p>collaborate with the Iraqi Red Crescent Society once it re- </p><p>emerges. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>ABUSE PREVENTION UNIT </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  Representatives of the Iraqi Refugee Aid Council (IRAC) </p><p>reported that documents have been completely looted from </p><p>Government of Iraq (GOI) intelligence offices in Umm Qasr. </p><p>IRAC also repeated what many news organizations have </p><p>reported over the last two days: widespread looting across </p><p>the country has scattered many of the documents (e.g., </p><p>property records, birth certificates, and intelligence </p><p>documents) that could be used to reconcile volatile disputes </p><p>and help establish the true extent of prior abuses by the </p><p>GOI. News reports indicate that documents in some Baghdad </p><p>hospitals have been destroyed. </p><p> </p><p>7.  Coalition forces investigating the warehouse where </p><p>hundreds of bodies were discovered outside of Umm Qasr used </p><p>the USAID Field Guide to Preventing, Mitigating and </p><p>Responding to Human Rights Abuses as a reference in their </p><p>investigation. </p><p> </p><p>8. On 12 April, a DART Abuse Prevention Officer (APO) </p><p>traveled to An Nasiriyah with a DART advance party for a </p><p>three-day assessment trip.  The APO will make contact with </p><p>Coalition forces operating in the area and meet with local </p><p>leaders to assess patterns of abuse and vulnerable segments </p><p>of the population. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>TRANSITION INITIATIVES </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  The DART\'s Transitions Officer and grant administrators </p><p>met for the second time with the newly designated village </p><p>council in Umm Qasr on 12 April.  A list of equipment and </p><p>supplies needed for the council to become fully operational </p><p>was developed and plans to provide office space were </p><p>discussed.  In addition, requirements for refurbishing a </p><p>primary school were examined.  A follow-up meeting is </p><p>planned for next week. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>COALITION ASSESSMENT OF POWER IN AN NAJAF </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  Coalition forces conducted an assessment of the power </p><p>situation in An Najaf on 10 April.  The assessment revealed </p><p>that fuel consumption at the power plant is much greater </p><p>than earlier indicated.  The plant requires 2,000 gallons of </p><p>natural gas per day per megawatt produced.  The holding tank </p><p>on site has a capacity of 200,000 gallons.  The primary fuel </p><p>line for this plant runs from Basrah, but pressure in that </p><p>line is dropping.  Coalition forces were informed that if </p><p>the natural gas flow from Basrah can be restored, the power </p><p>plant in An Najaf as well as plants at other locations will </p><p>be self-sustaining and operational.  Coalition forces are </p><p>investigating the status of the natural gas pipeline coming </p><p>to An Najaf from Basrah. </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
