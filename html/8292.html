<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 003475 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EB/IFD AND EUR/SE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/28/2008 </p><p>TAGS: EAID, EFIN, PREL, IZ, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: COMMUNICATING WITH TURKISH OFFICIALS ON IRAQ </p><p>RECONSTRUCTION/PERSONNEL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. (A) STATE 123372 </p><p>     B. (B) STATE 130 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by DCM Robert Deutsch.  Reason: 1.5(b,d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Reftels instructed embassies to identify a high-level </p><p>point of contact in host governments for a virtual e-mail </p><p>contact group on Iraq reconstruction, and to ask host </p><p>governments to send resumes to State and ORHA of experts who </p><p>might be able to support Iraqi ministries.  Embassy strongly </p><p>supports both initiatives, but believes it is important that </p><p>we be able to follow and, where appropriate, comment on any </p><p>information and resumes the Turkish Government sends to </p><p>Washington. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) With the Department\'s assistance, we resolved this </p><p>problem vis-a-vis the resumes by asking the GOT to e-mail </p><p>them to us first, so we can identify possible problems or </p><p>potential conflicts of interest.  We wonder if a similar </p><p>approach might be possible on the virtual e-mail contact </p><p>group, so that an Embassy POC could be sure that information </p><p>is distributed in both directions -- U.S. to GOT and GOT to </p><p>U.S. -- and could follow up on questions or ideas.  We are </p><p>reluctant to stand in the way of modern communications, but </p><p>think it is important that Embassy be able to provide context </p><p>for information Turkish authorities provide to the USG. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
