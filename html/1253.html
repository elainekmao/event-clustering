REASONS 1.5 (B) AND </p><p>(D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) IN SEPARATE INCIDENTS ON AUGUST 21, POLICE </p><p>EVICTED WAR VETERANS FROM A COMMERCIAL FARM ON THE </p><p>SOUTHERN OUTSKIRTS OF HARARE AND ARRESTED 13 WAR VETERANS </p><p>WHO HAD BARRICADED A ROAD EAST OF THE CAPITAL.  IN THE </p><p>FIRST INCIDENT, POLICE TOLD THE WAR VETERANS TO LEAVE </p><p>BECAUSE THE FARM THEY HAD OCCUPIED SINCE MAY HAD NOT BEEN </p><p>DESIGNATED FOR RESETTLEMENT, THEN PROCEEDED TO SET THEIR </p><p>MAKESHIFT HUTS ABLAZE.  IN THE SECOND CASE, THE ARRESTED </p><p>WAR VETERANS HAD BLOCKADED A ROAD TO PROTEST THE SLOW </p><p>PACE OF RESETTLEMENT IN THE GOROMONZI AREA EAST OF </p><p>HARARE. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) ALTHOUGH THE GOZ CONTINUES TO PRESS AHEAD WITH ITS </p><p>ACCELERATED LAND ACQUISITION PROGRAM -- RECENTLY </p><p>IDENTIFYING 229 ADDITIONAL FARMS AS READY FOR THE FINAL </p><p>STEP OF COMPULSORY ACQUISITION -- IT APPEARS, FINALLY, AT </p><p>LEAST IN THESE TWO INSTANCES, TO BE CRACKING DOWN ON THE </p><p>FREE REIGN ENJOYED BY THE WAR VETERANS DURING THE PAST </p><p>SIX MONTHS.  IN AN INTERVIEW IN THE GOVERNMENT-INFLUENCED </p><p>"THE HERALD" ON AUGUST 22, HOME AFFAIRS MINISTER JOHN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  04662  221559Z </p><p>NKOMO INSISTED THAT LAWLESSNESS ON THE FARMS, INCLUDING </p><p>INTERFERENCE WITH NORMAL FARMING ACTIVITIES, AND </p><p>UNAUTHORIZED LAND ALLOCATIONS WOULD NOT BE TOLERATED. </p><p>NKOMO ALSO PUBLICLY CRITICIZED THE AUGUST 19 CALL BY WAR </p><p>VETERANS LEADER CHENJERAI HUNZVI FOR INVASIONS OF </p><p>ADDITIONAL FARMS, FACTORIES, AND COMMERCIAL </p><p>ESTABLISHMENTS.  THIS IS ENCOURAGING IN LIGHT OF THE </p><p>MINISTER\'S LESS THAN HELPFUL AND CONTRADICTORY COMMENTS </p><p>TO THE AMBASSADOR DURING THEIR MEETING ON AUGUST 16 (REF </p><p>A). </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) COMMENT: THESE TWO INCIDENTS OF POLICE </p><p>INTERVENTION ARE AN ENCOURAGING DEPARTURE FROM GOZ NON- </p><p>ACTION TO DATE, IN WHICH THE GOVERNMENT HAS TURNED A </p><p>BLIND EYE TO THE VETERANS\' ILLEGAL BEHAVIOR.  IT IS </p><p>POSSIBLE THAT THE WAR VETERANS HAVE OUTLIVED MUCH OF </p><p>THEIR USEFULNESS FOR THE GOVERNMENT, AND, IN FACT ARE </p><p>DOING SO MUCH DAMAGE TO THE GOZ\'S CREDIBILITY THAT THEY </p><p>HAVE BECOME A LIABILITY.  THIS COULD EXPLAIN THE POLICE </p><p>ACTIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE.  WHILE THE GOVERNMENT HAS TAKEN </p><p>THIS IMPORTANT FIRST STEP IN RESTORING SOME SEMBLANCE OF </p><p>ORDER, THE POLICE ACTIONS WERE, SO FAR, AN ISOLATED </p><p>INSTANCE.  THEY OCCURRED IN THE WAKE OF REPORTS OF NEW </p><p>FARM INVASIONS NEAR MASVINGO, IN SOUTH-CENTRAL ZIMBABWE. </p><p>IT WILL BEAR CLOSE WATCHING, THEREFORE, TO SEE WHETHER </p><p>THE VETERANS\' UNBRIDLED FREEDOM IS COMING TO AN END, AS </p><p>WELL AS THE GOVERNMENT\'S TACIT, OFTEN DIRECT, SUPPORT FOR </p><p>THEIR ACTIVITIES.  CLEARLY, MUCH, MUCH MORE MUST BE DONE </p><p>TO DEMONSTRATE TO ZIMBABWEANS AND THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>COMMUNITY THAT THE GOZ IS GENUINELY COMMITTED TO </p><p>RESTORING THE RULE OF LAW. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  04662  221559Z </p><p> </p><p>MCDONALD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
