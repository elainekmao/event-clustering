<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 001843 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, KWMN, NI, HUM </p><p>SUBJECT: MEETING WITH REPRESENTATIVE GBEMI SARAKI, KWARA </p><p>STATE </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD JETER FOR REASON 1.5 (B) </p><p>AND (D) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Gbemisola "Gbemi" Saraki Forowa, a member of the </p><p>House of Representatives from Kwara state, was born into </p><p>Nigeria\'s political elite. Her political muscle comes from </p><p>being the daughter of Olusola Saraki, the godfather of </p><p>Kwara State politics and an important cog in the APP.  As </p><p>with most successful women in Nigeria, her father, a former </p><p>Presidential candidate, facilitated her political career. </p><p>Over lunch Gbemi, an opinionated and often colorful </p><p>speaker, provided her thoughts on the state of Nigerian </p><p>politics. Although contending that politics is a "man\'s </p><p>game," Gbemi claimed to play the game as hard as her male </p><p>counterparts. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> Women in Politics: </p><p> ---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Though clearly relishing the game, Gbemi said she </p><p>would discourage her own daughter from adhering to her </p><p>footsteps. It is impossible for a woman to successfully </p><p>manage a career in politics and a family, she said, citing </p><p>meetings routinely held between 11pm and 4 am as evidence </p><p>of deliberate attempts to discourage women. Gbemi explained </p><p>that the barriers women face range from major hurdles to </p><p>the petty biases. For example, women in the National </p><p>Assembly are expected to wear traditional head wraps. Gbemi </p><p>recalled being scorned on the floor of the Assembly for not </p><p>dressing according to tradition; she said she will never </p><p>make that mistake again. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>For the Love of Na\'abba </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Further, she said that women in politics often find </p><p>themselves the victims of rumors about adultery.  Gbemi, </p><p>who is divorced, has faced accusations of a tryst with her </p><p>mentor, House Speaker Ghali Na\'abba. She was candid about </p><p>Na\'abba\'s financial improprieties, but stated that the </p><p>attempt to impeach Na\'abba in May was engineered by the </p><p>Presidency and Obasanjo supporters in the House.  They </p><p>wanted to remove Na\'abba because of his public opposition </p><p>to Obasanjo on key matters ranging from the electoral law </p><p>to the federal budget. While acknowledging the Speaker has </p><p>dipped his hand into the jar, she defended him, stating </p><p>that Speaker was behaving in time-honored tradition. It is </p><p>customary in Nigeria to use public funds to develop one\'s </p><p>political network. Gbemi said, the voters expect </p><p>politicians to come with money and bags of rice for votes. </p><p>However, because of Na\'abba\'s riff with the President, he </p><p>does not receive any government contracts which he could </p><p>parlay into funds for his political war chest. Instead, he </p><p>must make his own way by using House funds and his position </p><p>as Speaker to get favorable loans. She concluded her </p><p>thoughts on the Speaker by stating adamantly that although </p><p>claims of Na\'bba\'s misappropriation are without a doubt </p><p>true, he will not be removed because of his popularity with </p><p>most House members. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>Thoughts on Obasanjo </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Clearly a die-hard APP partisan, Gbemi painted a </p><p>picture of Obasanjo as vindictive, temperamental leader. </p><p>She told a story of one of Obasanjo\'s personal assistants </p><p>whose honesty angered the President. Driving pass the new </p><p>30 billion Naira stadium under construction on the way from </p><p>the airport, Obasanjo voiced exasperation about people who </p><p>criticized the cost and utility. The assistant tried to </p><p>explain that people were not necessarily adverse to the </p><p>stadium but some felt there were more pressing social </p><p>problems to which the funds could have been directed. </p><p>Fuming, Obasanjo told the driver to stop the car and </p><p>ordered his assistant to make the rest of the journey by </p><p>foot. (Comment: This is one several such stories in </p><p>circulation. Many of the tales are likely apocryphal. </p><p>However, they have currency because they fit popular </p><p>perceptions of Obasanjo\'s character. Whether real or make- </p><p>believe, the tales reinforce negative opinions of the </p><p>President, steadily damaging his image.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Gbemi said Obasanjo\'s autocratic behavior has caused </p><p>him to lose support in his own PDP party. The President </p><p>views himself as "the Messiah", she opined.  Gbemi said </p><p>that she is close to the National Security Advisor, Aliyu </p><p>Mohammed, who she believed could resign from his current </p><p>position because he has been marginalized by the </p><p>Presidency. Mohammed may emerge as the candidate to </p><p>represent the North, she felt. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) On the other hand, the Vice President, Gbemi said, </p><p>has betrayed his fellow Northerners. Gbemi continued, </p><p>Obasanjo is using the Vice President to his own detriment </p><p>and in fact may be putting Atiku\'s life on the line. </p><p>(Comment: Gbemi did not elaborate further but she was </p><p>clearly implying the Vice President was liable to haveother </p><p>untoward experiences such as the stone throwing incident in </p><p>Kano.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Despite the internecine feuding within the party, </p><p>Gbemi revealed that she is considering a switch to the PDP. </p><p>Although questioned, she made almost no mention of her </p><p>father\'s plans or rumors that he is also thinking joining </p><p>the PDP. Her desire to change allegiance probably are due </p><p>to frustration with her father\'s diminished influence </p><p>within the APP party and the recently announced change of </p><p>the APP party to the ANPP. Gbemi\'s closeness to Na\'abba may </p><p>also be a factor. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Comment: Gbemi Saraki\'s comments were illuminating </p><p>and show the extra burden that female politicians carry. </p><p>While her statements that Na\'abba\'s malfeasance was not </p><p>extraordinary may be true, her nonchalance about his </p><p>transgressions was troubling. Confirming what Gbemi stated </p><p>about the riff between NSA Mohammed and the president, </p><p>other other sources have also indicated that Mohammed  may </p><p>break camp; yet  we doubt if he will try to hoist his own </p><p>presidential banner. Most likely, neither will someone </p><p>closer to Gbemi, her father.  Like father, like daughter: </p><p>recent newspapers report that he too will abandon the APP </p><p>for the PDP, increasing the anti-Obasanjo quotient within </p><p>the party by two. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ANDREWS </p><p></p></div>
