<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 ANKARA 004178 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR INR/R/MR, EUR/SE, EUR/PD, NEA/PD, DRL </p><p>JCS PASS J-5/CDR S. WRIGHT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: OPRC, KMDR, TU, Press Summaries </p><p>SUBJECT: ANKARA MEDIA REACTION REPORT </p><p>TUESDAY, JULY 1, 2003 </p><p> </p><p>THIS REPORT WILL PRESENT A TURKISH PRESS SUMMARY UNDER THREE </p><p>THEMES: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HEADLINES </p><p>BRIEFING </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>HEADLINES </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MASS APPEAL </p><p>Congressman Biden: Turkish troops to Iraq - Hurriyet </p><p>U.S. treats Iraqi prisoners brutally - Hurriyet </p><p>Iraqi prisoners were denied water, toilet - Sabah </p><p>U.S. tortures Iraqi prisoners - Aksam </p><p>Straw: No reason to attack Iran - Aksam </p><p>Sezer delays EU adjustment - Sabah </p><p>Gul asks for Powell\'s support for Cyprus solution - Milliyet </p><p>Saddam rumored to wander through Baghdad streets - Vatan </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>OPINION MAKERS </p><p>Call intensifying for Turkish troops to Iraq - Zaman </p><p>Amnesty International: U.S. violates international law in </p><p>Iraq - Cumhuriyet </p><p>Iraq: USA\'s new Guantanamo - Yeni Safak </p><p>U.S. launches `Operation Rattlesnake\' to get Saddam - </p><p>Radikal </p><p>Iran to extradite Al-Qaida members - Yeni Safak </p><p>Israel withdraws from Gaza - Yeni Safak </p><p>Israel\'s `secret prisons\' unveiled - Zaman </p><p>Israel boycotts BBC - Radikal </p><p>Italian minister: Turkey\'s military guarantor of regime - </p><p>Cumhuriyet </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BRIEFING </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>U.S. Congressmen ask for Turkish troops: U.S. Congressmen </p><p>have urged the American Administration to seek the support </p><p>of NATO members like Turkey, Germany and France who did not </p><p>cooperate fully with the U.S. in the war with Iraq.  These </p><p>countries could help the U.S. solve the security problem in </p><p>Iraq.  `This might be a way to convince the Iraqis that the </p><p>U.S. is not an occupier,\' Joseph Biden said over the </p><p>weekend. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>President vetoes EU adjustment laws: President Sezer has </p><p>vetoed sections of a package of reform laws designed to </p><p>bring Turkey into compliance with EU membership standards. </p><p>Sezer voiced concern that the amendments to the anti-terror </p><p>law would leave acts of terrorism unpunished.  Mainstream </p><p>and liberal papers criticize Sezer for creating an obstacle </p><p>on Turkey\'s road to the EU.  AKP officials were disappointed </p><p>by the veto, and said the parliament will send the package </p><p>back to the President without changes. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Gul to U.S. in late July: "Hurriyet" claims that the U.S. </p><p>and Turkey have started preparations for a visit to the U.S. </p><p>by Foreign Minister Gul in the last week of July.  Hurriyet </p><p>believes the Gul visit will pave the way for an official </p><p>visit to Washington by Prime Minister Erdogan. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Gul gives Powell Cyprus message: Foreign Minister Gul told </p><p>Secretary Powell at WEF meetings in Amman last month that </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>the Cyprus problem could be resolved if some modifications </p><p>are made to the UN-sponsored peace plan.  Gul also asserted </p><p>to Greek Foreign Minister Papandreou and UN Secretary </p><p>General Annan that Turkey was exerting considerable effort </p><p>for a reaching a Cyprus solution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turkish Cypriot opposition unites against Denktas: The </p><p>Social Liberation Party (TKP), the most prominent opposition </p><p>group in Northern Cyprus, has established the `Peace and </p><p>Democracy Movement\' in alliance with two leftist parties and </p><p>16 NGOs.  The coalition is also backed by businessmen, </p><p>academics, and artists.  The leading leftist party, the </p><p>Republican Turkish Party (CTP) has not joined the block. </p><p>Commentaries expect pro-Denktas parties in North Cyprus to </p><p>form an alliance as well. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Ambassador Signs Agreement for Beef Cattle Feasibility </p><p>Study:  Papers report that Ambassador Pearson and </p><p>representatives of Run Agra, a U.S. company, signed a letter </p><p>of intent with Yasar Holding\'s Camli Livestock Company for a </p><p>feasibility study for the use of U.S. cattle production </p><p>techniques in Turkey.  The $460,000 agreement is being </p><p>financed by the U.S. Trade Development Agency, and is part </p><p>of an effort to increase Turkish beef production. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Amnesty International: U.S. mistreats Iraqi prisoners: </p><p>Amnesty International (AI) announced that it has collected </p><p>evidence showing American mistreatment of Iraqi prisoners. </p><p>In a report submitted to the UN-sponsored human rights </p><p>conference in Baghdad, AI noted that hundreds of Iraqis </p><p>affiliated with Saddam\'s regime are being held in tent </p><p>camps, and have been denied the chance to meet with their </p><p>families or lawyers.  The prisoners include not only high- </p><p>level officials of the former regime, but also looters and </p><p>petty criminals, the AI report noted. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION: US-Turkish relations in the post Iraq war </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Washington\'s view of the Turkish military" </p><p>Sedat Ergin observed in mass appeal Hurriyet (7/1): "The </p><p>atmosphere in Washington leads me to conclude that the </p><p>effects of Turkey\'s rejection of the parliamentary motion </p><p>during the Iraq crisis will not be easily eliminated.  It </p><p>will really take time to cure the bilateral relationship.  . </p><p>In Washington there is a strong antipathy toward the Turkish </p><p>military, which is blamed for the rejection of the US troop </p><p>deployment in Turkey.  There are many on Washington scene </p><p>who put the blame directly on the military, and do not </p><p>consider the matter as an outcome of the democratic process. </p><p>.. It seems AKP propaganda about the issue (pinning the </p><p>blame on the military) has been influential in Washington as </p><p>well.  The Pentagon in particular remains very upset with </p><p>the Turkish military, because it took the military for </p><p>granted from the beginning.  There is also a failure to </p><p>appreciate the psychological effect among the public of the </p><p>spectre of the deployment of 60,000 US soldiers in Turkey. </p><p>By blaming the Turkish military for the entire affair, </p><p>decision-makers in Washington are avoiding admitting their </p><p>own mistakes." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Formulating a foreign policy without Washington\'s support" </p><p>Murat Yetkin shared his observations in the liberal- </p><p>intellectual Radikal (7/1): "Washington blames the Turkish </p><p>military for the rejection of the motion to allow US troops </p><p>in Turkey during the Iraq crisis. The American military </p><p>shares this conviction. . The Pentagon and State Department </p><p>are more calm than the US military hierarchy, as </p><p>demonstrated by Secretary Powell\'s visit to Turkey and the </p><p>decision to provide $1 billion in aid to Turkey. . The whole </p><p>issue provides a lesson for both sides.  From now on, </p><p>neither Turkey nor the US can take each other for granted. </p><p>In this way, bilateral ties will likely be carried to a new </p><p>level.  Ties between Turkey and the US can be divided into </p><p>two periods: the first 40 years marked by a policy of </p><p>containment against Russia, and the last 10 years by a </p><p>policy of containment against Iraq. Instability in the </p><p>Balkans can be added to the factors shaping relations in </p><p>recent times. Turkey has always considered itself </p><p>indispensable for the US because of Incirlik airbase. </p><p>Whenever the Cyprus or Armenian issues were brought to the </p><p>agenda, Turkey\'s strategic importance was sufficient to </p><p>persuade the White House as well as Congress. . Now Ankara </p><p>will have to cope with these problems for itself. By </p><p>approving the March 1 motion, Turkey might have ensured the </p><p>backing of the US for a while, but US support would still </p><p>have diminished in the end. The rejection has caught Turkey </p><p>unprepared for this inevitability.  There is, however, a </p><p>positive side as well. As a result of the rupture with the </p><p>United States, Turkey has gained a chance to shape its </p><p>foreign policy without relying on US support. Turkey now </p><p>might be able to develop healthier and stronger ties both </p><p>with the US and the EU." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
