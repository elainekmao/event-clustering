<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 000026 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>OFFICIAL INFORMAL </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA/INS FROM AMBASSADOR WILLS </p><p> </p><p>E.O.  12958:  DECL:  01-06-12 </p><p>TAGS: CE, MV, AGMT, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  OFFICIAL INFORMAL NUMBER 02  (01-06-03) </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Wills, Reasons 1.5 (b, d) </p><p> </p><p>CONTENTS:  AMBASSADOR RECEIVES EPDP DELEGATION </p><p>           PRIME MINISTER\'S SPEECH </p><p>           MALDIVES AND ICC </p><p>           PRO-LTTE ODE TO A MID-WINTER\'S DAY </p><p> </p><p>AMBASSADOR RECEIVES EPDP DELEGATION </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>1.  (C) The Ambassador received an EPDP delegation led by </p><p>its leader, Douglas Devananda, today.  As expected, the </p><p>group complained about the LTTE.  Among the EPDP\'s </p><p>allegations of Tiger harassment were various instances of </p><p>physical attacks, threats against family members, </p><p>abductions, and at least one killing.  Devananda also </p><p>claimed that the LTTE was distributing leaflets to EPDP </p><p>cadre and other non-LTTE Tamils in the east demanding </p><p>that they resign from political life and lead "normal" </p><p>lives.  (Note:  The pro-LTTE website "TamilNet" admitted </p><p>to the pamphlets in its posting today.)  The Ambassador </p><p>responded that the USG supports pluralism and that we do </p><p>not believe that the LTTE is the sole representative of </p><p>the Tamil people.  The Ambassador added, however, that </p><p>before formulating any response to the recent incidents </p><p>it would be best to await the outcome of the talks in </p><p>Thailand.  If the LTTE shows a willingness to compromise </p><p>on the high security zone issue and is willing to engage </p><p>with the GSL on human rights matters, that may be a sign </p><p>that the LTTE is willing to review its position on </p><p>political parties in the north and east.  (POL) </p><p> </p><p>PRIME MINISTER\'S SPEECH </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>2.  (SBU) On Sunday night, January 5, Prime Minister </p><p>Wickremesinghe gave a nationally televised address.  In </p><p>essence, the address was a "State of the Union"-type of </p><p>speech in which the PM reviewed what he considered his </p><p>coalition\'s major successes of the last year.  Three </p><p>major points seemed to emerge:  (1) The PM stated that </p><p>the peace process was at a "decisive moment" and that it </p><p>was now time to start making a transition to a permanent </p><p>peace.  (2) The PM also reached out to the President, </p><p>urging her to work with him to make peace possible. </p><p>(3) The PM also spent much of the speech underscoring the </p><p>GSL\'s commitment to economic growth/reform.   We have </p><p>faxed you a copy of the speech and we will refer to it in </p><p>front-channel reporting.  (POL) </p><p> </p><p>MALDIVES AND ICC </p><p>---------------- </p><p>3.  (C) Mission continues to work with the Maldivian </p><p>government re the ICC Article 98 proposal.  We confirmed </p><p>to the MFA today that both India and Nepal have now </p><p>signed no-surrender agreements with the United States (in </p><p>addition to Sri Lanka and Afghanistan in this region). </p><p>Permanent Secretary Shaheed responded that the MFA </p><p>continued to review our proposal very closely.  (POL) </p><p> </p><p>PRO-LTTE ODE TO A MID-WINTER\'S DAY </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>3.  (U) FYI.  We received a belated New Year\'s card from </p><p>a pro-LTTE party today.  The poem in the card was quite </p><p>elegant, touching on sincerity and peace -- and yet it </p><p>contained so much technical information, including on the </p><p>high security zone issue!!  It clearly was not written by </p><p>T.S. Eliot, but it\'s sort of inspirational in an odd way </p><p>(particularly if you have been lying under a rock in the </p><p>Wanni for the past 20 years and your only friend was an </p><p>AK-47).  We wanted to share it with you: </p><p> </p><p>"Be the prevailing peace </p><p>Be pregnant with permanence </p><p>Be sensible and sincere with deliverance. </p><p>We bless with open mind governance. </p><p> </p><p>Let\'s toil steadfastly, </p><p>To make our brethrens, strongly </p><p>To live upright with freedom, eternally </p><p>In the motherland freely, </p><p> </p><p>Let\'s break down, </p><p>The barriers of the, </p><p>Aggressive zones that, </p><p>Pierce the self dignity of Tamils. </p><p> </p><p>Let\'s rise to the occasion of unification, </p><p>To win the Sri Lankan Tamil\'s aspirations, </p><p>In the birth of, </p><p>The embodiment of, </p><p>The universal light" </p><p> </p><p>Kinda brings a tear to the ol\' eyeballs, eh? (POL) </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
