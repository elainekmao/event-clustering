IRVING FOR </p><p>REASONS 1.5 (B/D). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) ON MARCH 30, LABOFF MET WITH CHARLES CHIVIRU, THE </p><p>EXECUTIVE SECRETARY OF THE ZIMBABWE PUBLIC SERVICE </p><p>ASSOCIATION (PSA), TO DISCUSS THE LABOR RELATIONS </p><p>AMENDMENT (LRA) BILL THAT IS CURRENTLY BEING CONSIDERED </p><p>BY PARLIAMENT.  CHIVIRU IS CONCERNED THAT THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>OF ZIMBABWE (GOZ) WILL ATTEMPT TO FAST-TRACK THE BILL </p><p>THROUGH PARLIAMENT WITHOUT ANY AMENDMENTS OR CHANGES, </p><p>BECAUSE IT CONTAINS PROVISIONS THAT EFFECTIVELY INCREASE </p><p>THE GOZ\'S CONTROL OVER UNIONS AND WORKERS.  THE BILL\'S </p><p>LANGUAGE MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR UNIONS AND WORKERS </p><p>TO ENGAGE IN INDUSTRIAL ACTIONS, AND ALSO INCLUDES </p><p>PROVISIONS FOR IMPOSING FINES AND JAIL TERMS AGAINST </p><p>UNIONS AND INDIVIDUAL LABOR LEADERS WHO INCITE MEMBERS </p><p>TO UNDERTAKE INDUSTRIAL ACTIONS, INCLUDING STAYAWAYS. </p><p>CHIVIRU STATED THAT THE GOZ WANTS THIS BILL QUICKLY </p><p>PASSED INTO LAW SO THAT IT WILL STRENGTHEN ITS HAND IN </p><p>PREVENTING STAYAWAYS AND OTHER INDUSTRIAL ACTIONS AS THE </p><p>2002 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN SHIFTS INTO HIGH-GEAR.  TO </p><p>COUNTER THIS EFFORT, THE PSA AND ZIMBABWE CONGRESS OF </p><p>TRADE UNIONS (ZCTU) ARE JOINTLY LOBBYING MEMBERS OF </p><p>PARLIAMENT FROM BOTH THE RULING ZIMBABWE AFRICAN </p><p>NATIONAL UNION - PATRIOTIC FRONT (ZANU-PF) AND THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01222  01 OF 02  051838Z </p><p>OPPOSITION MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC) TO </p><p>REVIEW AND PROVIDE AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S PUBLIC SERVICE ASSOCIATION </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) THE PSA IS AN UMBRELLA ORGANIZATION THAT </p><p>REPRESENTS 40,000 ZIMBABWE CIVIL SERVANTS.  CIVIL </p><p>SERVANTS IN ZIMBABWE ARE REPRESENTED BY ASSOCIATIONS, AS </p><p>OPPOSED TO UNIONS, BECAUSE THE GOZ DOES NOT RECOGNIZE </p><p>THEIR RIGHT TO UNIONIZE.  IN EFFECT, THESE ASSOCIATIONS </p><p>FUNCTION AS UNIONS FOR THEIR MEMBERS, AND THE PSA IS AN </p><p>AFFILIATE OF THE ZCTU.  THE PSA HAS UNDER ITS UMBRELLA </p><p>THE CIVIL SERVICE EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION (CSEA), THE </p><p>ADMINISTRATIVE AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION </p><p>(AEOA), THE PROFESSIONAL AND TECHNICAL OFFICERS </p><p>ASSOCIATION (PTOA), AND THE GOVERNMENT WORKERS </p><p>ASSOCIATION (GWA). </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>THE LRA IS MORE BAD THAN GOOD </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) ACCORDING TO CHIVIRU, THE CURRENT LRA HAS </p><p>LITTLE RESEMBLANCE TO THE PROPOSED HARMONIZED LABOR BILL </p><p>THAT WAS DRAFTED BY THE INTERNATIONAL LABOR ORGANIZATION </p><p>(ILO) FOR ZIMBABWE IN 1993.  THE NEW BILL INCORPORATES </p><p>ELEMENTS FAVORED BY CIVIL SERVANTS, INCLUDING BRINGING </p><p>CIVIL SERVANTS UNDER THE LRA, ESTABLISHING WORK COUNCILS </p><p>FOR CIVIL SERVANTS, PROVIDING MATERNITY LEAVE, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  01222  01 OF 02  051838Z </p><p>PROHIBITING SEXUAL HARASSMENT, AND PROVIDING </p><p>CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION SERVICES.  HOWEVER, CHIVIRU </p><p>STATED THESE POSITIVES ARE OUTWEIGHED BY THE BILL\'S </p><p>NEGATIVES, WHICH HE LISTED.  THE LRA FAILS TO REPLACE </p><p>THE PUBLIC SERVICE ACT (PSA), UNDER WHICH CIVIL </p><p>SERVANTS\' TERMS OF EMPLOYMENT AND LABOR RIGHTS ARE </p><p>CURRENTLY GOVERNED (AND LIMITED).  INSTEAD, THE LRA </p><p>SUPPLEMENTS THE PSA.  THE LRA GRANTS THE RIGHT OF </p><p>COLLECTIVE BARGAINING TO CIVIL SERVANTS, BUT ONLY </p><p>THROUGH THE CREATION OF A PUBLIC SERVICE NATIONAL </p><p>EMPLOYMENT COUNCIL (PSNEC).  THE LRA DOES NOT SPECIFY </p><p>WHEN THE PSNEC WILL BE FORMED, AND LEAVES THIS DECISION </p><p>UP TO THE MINISTER OF LABOR.  ACCORDING TO CHIVIRU, THE </p><p>MINISTER OF LABOR COULD CHOOSE TO TAKE NO ACTION ON </p><p>FORMING THE PSNEC, AND THEN CIVIL SERVANTS WOULD REMAIN </p><p>WITHOUT THE RIGHT OF COLLECTIVE BARGAINING. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) THE LRA ALSO DOES NOT DEFINE THE BASIS ON WHICH </p><p>CIVIL SERVANTS CAN BE DEEMED ESSENTIAL EMPLOYEES.  IT </p><p>LEAVES THIS UP TO THE GOZ TO DETERMINE.  IN THE PAST, </p><p>THE GOZ HAS DEFINED MOST CIVIL SERVANTS AS ESSENTIAL IN </p><p>ORDER TO PROHIBIT THEIR ENGAGING IN STAYAWAYS AND OTHER </p><p>LABOR ACTIONS.  CHIVIRU SAID A FINAL SERIOUS FLAW IS </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ4607 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  01222  02 OF 02  051839Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   CIAE-00  COME-00  CTME-00  DODE-00  EB-00 </p><p>      EXIM-01  E-00     VC-00    FRB-00   H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00 </p><p>      ITC-01   LAB-01   AC-01    NSAE-00  OMB-01   OPIC-01  OPM-01 </p><p>      ACE-00   SP-00    SSO-00   STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  DRL-02 </p><p>      G-00     SAS-00     /010W </p><p>                  ------------------DC048A  051839Z /45 </p><p>R 041553Z APR 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 8581 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC </p><p>DEPT OF LABOR WASHDC </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 001222 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DRL/IL FOR KBRYANT </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JFRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR BWILLIAMS </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p>PASS USAID FOR AFR/SD - DWELLER, AFR/SA - CPALMA, </p><p>NNEWMAN, AA/AFR - VDICKSON-HORTON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/04/11 </p><p>TAGS: ELAB, PHUM, PGOV, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: ZIMBABWE\'S CIVIL SERVANTS CONCERNED THAT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  01222  02 OF 02  051839Z </p><p>PROPOSED LABOR BILL DOES MORE HARM THAN GOOD </p><p> </p><p>THAT ALTHOUGH THE LRA MENTIONS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A </p><p>LABOR COURT, ALONG WITH THE QUALIFICATIONS FOR JUDGES IN </p><p>THIS COURT, IT DOES NOT MENTION THE PROCEDURES BY WHICH </p><p>IT WILL OPERATE, NOR WHETHER IT WILL BE INDEPENDENT OF </p><p>THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH.  WITHOUT AN INDEPENDENT LABOR </p><p>COURT, CHIVIRU ARGUES, WORKERS IN GENERAL, AND CIVIL </p><p>SERVANTS IN PARTICULAR, WILL NOT RECEIVE FAIR HEARINGS </p><p>IN LABOR DISPUTES WITH THE GOZ. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>A GOZ EFFORT TO GAIN CONTROL OVER UNIONS </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) CHIVIRU VIEWS THE LRA BILL AS AN EFFORT BY THE </p><p>GOZ TO RESTRICT LABOR RIGHTS AND GAIN EFFECTIVE CONTROL </p><p>OVER THE LABOR ACTIONS OF UNIONS AND WORKERS, RATHER </p><p>THAN AN EFFORT TO IMPROVE OR MODERNIZE ZIMBABWE\'S LABOR </p><p>LAW.  OF PARTICULAR CONCERN TO CHIVIRU ARE PROVISIONS OF </p><p>THE LRA REQUIRING UNIONS TO CANVASS THEIR MEMBERSHIP </p><p>BEFORE ENGAGING IN INDUSTRIAL ACTIONS, AND THE INCLUSION </p><p>OF FINES AND PRISON TERMS FOR INDIVIDUAL LABOR LEADERS </p><p>WHO ARE FOUND GUILTY OF INCITING WORKERS TO ENGAGE IN </p><p>ILLEGAL LABOR ACTIONS.  CHIVIRU STATED THAT THE LRA </p><p>REQUIREMENT THAT A UNION CANVASS ITS MEMBERS BEFORE </p><p>ENGAGING IN AN INDUSTRIAL ACTION WOULD LARGELY PREVENT </p><p>SUCH ACTIONS.  HE EXPLAINED THAT HOLDING SUCH ELECTIONS, </p><p>WITH INDIVIDUAL UNIONS\' MEMBERSHIPS SPREAD AROUND </p><p>ZIMBABWE, WOULD BE PROHIBITIVELY COSTLY.  IN ADDITION, </p><p>HE BELIEVES THAT THE GOZ WOULD INTERFERE IN SUCH </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01222  02 OF 02  051839Z </p><p>ELECTIONS TO UNDERMINE THEM AND TO INTIMIDATE WORKERS </p><p>INTO VOTING AGAINST PROPOSED INDUSTRIAL ACTIONS. </p><p>CHIVERU SAID THE PROVISION UNDER THE LRA BILL FOR A FINE </p><p>OF UP TO $30,000 ZIMBABWE DOLLARS (ABOUT US$600), OR UP </p><p>TO TWO YEARS IN PRISON FOR ANY INDIVIDUAL FOUND GUILTY </p><p>OF ENCOURAGING ANY ILLEGAL LABOR ACTION, WOULD HAVE A </p><p>CHILLING EFFECT ON THE ROLE PLAYED BY LABOR LEADERS. </p><p>THE LRA ALSO CONTAINS A PROVISION THAT WOULD HOLD LABOR </p><p>UNIONS AND LABOR OFFICIALS LIABLE FOR ANY PERSONAL </p><p>INJURIES OR PROPERTY DAMAGE THAT RESULT FROM THEIR </p><p>RECOMMENDING, ENCOURAGING, OR INCITING UNLAWFUL </p><p>INDUSTRIAL ACTIONS.  CHIVIRU STATED THAT THE PURPOSE FOR </p><p>THESE PROVISIONS IS NOT TO PROTECT ZIMBABWEAN SOCIETY </p><p>FROM DAMAGE FROM UNLAWFUL OR VIOLENT LABOR ACTIONS, BUT </p><p>RATHER TO MAKE ALL TYPES OF LABOR ACTIONS SO COSTLY THAT </p><p>LABOR UNIONS AND THEIR LEADERS WILL BE COWED INTO NOT </p><p>HOLDING THEM. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) WE AGREE WITH CHIVERU\'S READING OF THE LRA.  THE </p><p>BILL WILL SET BACK, RATHER THAN ADVANCE, THE RIGHTS OF </p><p>UNIONS AND THEIR WORKERS IN ZIMBABWE.  THE REASON THAT </p><p>THE GOZ HAS CHOSEN TO SUBMIT THE LRA THIS YEAR, AFTER </p><p>SITTING ON THE ILO DRAFT FOR THE LAST EIGHT YEARS, IS </p><p>NOT LOST ON UNION LEADERS: IT IS A CLEAR AND CALCULATED </p><p>REACTION TO THE SUCCESS OF THE MDC IN LAST YEAR\'S </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS.  THE GOZ RECOGNIZES THAT THE </p><p>ZCTU AND THE PSA WERE INSTRUMENTAL IN THE ORGANIZATIONAL </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  01222  02 OF 02  051839Z </p><p>AND ELECTORAL SUCCESS OF THE MDC.  PART OF THIS SUCCESS </p><p>WAS THE USE OF ZCTU-LED STAYAWAYS THAT COALESCED </p><p>OPPOSITION TO THE MUGABE GOVERNMENT.  IF THE GOZ </p><p>SUCCEEDS IN FAST-TRACKING THE LRA THROUGH PARLIAMENT </p><p>WITHOUT AMENDMENTS, IT WOULD GIVE THE GOZ NEW LEGAL </p><p>TOOLS TO CONTROL AND NEUTER ZIMBABWE\'S UNIONS IN ORDER </p><p>TO HINDER THEIR SUPPORT FOR THE MDC.  HOWEVER, GIVEN </p><p>THAT THE PARLIAMENTARY LEGAL COMMITTEE HAS ALREADY FOUND </p><p>THAT SECTIONS OF THE BILL CONTRAVENE CONSTITUTIONAL </p><p>GUARANTEES REGARDING FREEDOM OF ASSEMBLY AND </p><p>ASSOCIATION, IF IT IS FAST-TRACKED INTO LAW IT MIGHT NOT </p><p>SURVIVE A COURT CHALLENGE TO ITS CONSTITUTIONALITY.  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
