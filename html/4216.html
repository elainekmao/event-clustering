SUMMARY:  USAID/DCHA/OFDA\'S REGIONAL COORDINATOR FOR </p><p>ASIA VISITED HANOI OCTOBER 27-30 TO REVIEW DISASTER </p><p>PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE ACTIVITIES INCLUDING THOSE FUNDED </p><p>BY OFDA. THE GVNGVN CONTINUES TO DEMONSTRATE AN EXCEPTIONAL </p><p>COMMITMENT TO DISASTER PREPAREDNESS THAT IS PERHAPS </p><p>UNMATCHED IN THE ASIA REGION. THIS COMMITMENT STEMS FROM A </p><p>DISASTER PREPAREDNESS CULTURE SHAPED BY VIETNAM\'S EXTREME </p><p>VULNERABILITY TO NATURAL DISASTERS SUCH AS FLOODS AND </p><p>TYPHOONS. FLOOD LEVELS IN THE MEKONG BASIN THIS YEAR WERE </p><p>COMPARABLE TO 2000 AND 2001, BUT EFFECTIVE GVN PREPAREDNESS </p><p>MEASURES GREATLY REDUCED LOSS OF LIFE AND PROPERTY. </p><p>USAID/OFDA IS SUPPORTING TWO ONGOING DISASTER PREPAREDNESS </p><p>PROJECTS IN VIETNAM, INCLUDING A FLOOD EARLY WARNING SYSTEM </p><p>IN CENTRAL VIETNAM AND A COASTAL STORM EARLY WARNING SYSTEM. </p><p>USAID/OFDA HAS ALSO PROVIDED EMERGENCY RELIEF ASSISTANCE TO </p><p>VIETNAM TOTALING ABOUT USD 1.3 MILLION SINCE 1999. </p><p> </p><p>2.  USAID/DCHA/OFDA\'S REGIONAL COORDINATOR FOR ASIA VISITED </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02686  01 OF 02  060950Z </p><p>HANOI OCTOBER 27-30 TO REVIEW DISASTER PREPAREDNESS AND </p><p>RESPONSE ACTIVITIES IN VIETNAM, INCLUDING THOSE FUNDED BY </p><p>OFDA. REGIONAL COORDINATOR ROB THAYER MET WITH EMBASSY AND </p><p>USAID COLLEAGUES, NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL RED CROSS </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES, NGOS, AND A GVN DISASTER MANAGEMENT UNIT </p><p>WHICH IMPLEMENTS TWO OFDA-FUNDED DISASTER PREPAREDNESS </p><p>PROJECTS IN COLLABORATION WITH THE UNITED NATIONS </p><p>DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM (UNDP). </p><p> </p><p>3.  A DISASTER PREPAREDNESS CULTURE:  THE GVN CONTINUES TO </p><p>DEMONSTRATE AN EXCEPTIONAL COMMITMENT TO NATURAL DISASTER </p><p>PREPAREDNESS THAT IS PERHAPS UNMATCHED IN THE ASIA REGION. </p><p>GOVERNMENT INVESTMENTS IN DISASTER PREPAREDNESS DWARF </p><p>CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, AND THE </p><p>DISASTER PREPAREDNESS AGENDA HERE IS CLEARLY DRIVEN BY </p><p>NATIONAL PRIORITIES AND NOT BY DONORS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  VIETNAM\'S COMMITMENT TO DISASTER PREPAREDNESS STEMS FROM </p><p>WHAT HAS BEEN CALLED A DISASTER PREPAREDNESS CULTURE, SHAPED </p><p>BY THE COUNTRY\'S HISTORIC VULNERABILITY TO FLOODS AND </p><p>TYPHOONS. RECENT REMINDERS OF THIS VULNERABILITY INCLUDE THE </p><p>DEVASTATING CENTRAL VIETNAM FLOODS OF 1999, AND THE MEKONG </p><p>RIVER FLOODS OF 2000, EACH RESULTING IN HUNDREDS OF DEATHS </p><p>AND PROPERTY LOSSES IN THE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. </p><p>EVEN HANOI ITSELF, PROTECTED FROM THE RED RIVER FOR </p><p>CENTURIES BY AN ELABORATE SYSTEM OF DIKES, IS FEARED TO BE </p><p>VULNERABLE NOW, AS NATURAL FLOOD PROTECTION SUCH AS UPSTREAM </p><p>FORESTATION IS DEPLETED. </p><p> </p><p>5.  THE GVN WAS REMARKABLY WELL-PREPARED FOR THIS YEAR\'S </p><p>MEKONG DELTA FLOODING WHICH PEAKED IN SEPTEMBER, ACCORDING </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02686  01 OF 02  060950Z </p><p>TO RELIEF AGENCIES WORKING IN THE AREA. WHILE FLOOD LEVELS </p><p>WERE COMPARABLE TO THOSE OF 2000 AND 2001, LOSS OF LIFE AND </p><p>PROPERTY WERE CONSIDERABLY REDUCED BY CREATION OF "ISLANDS" </p><p>AS SAFE HAVENS FOR EVACUEES AND THEIR BELONGINGS (IN MOST </p><p>CASES ELEVATED AND WIDENED ROADWAYS); EFFECTIVE PRE- </p><p>POSITIONING OF RELIEF SUPPLIES IN FLOOD-PRONE SUB-DISTRICTS; </p><p>AND STRENGTHENING OF SECONDARY DIKES WHICH PROTECTED MUCH OF </p><p>THE FOOD CROP LONG ENOUGH TO ENABLE HARVESTING. </p><p> </p><p>6.  THE COORDINATING BODY FOR NATURAL DISASTER RESPONSE AND </p><p>PREPAREDNESS IN VIETNAM IS THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE FOR FLOOD </p><p>AND STORM CONTROL, HEADED BY THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND </p><p>RURAL DEVELOPMENT, WHICH OVERSEES A NETWORK OF PROVINCIAL </p><p>AND DISTRICT-LEVEL COMMITTEES. THE PRIME MINISTER TAKES A </p><p>PERSONAL INTEREST IN THESE EFFORTS, AND LOCAL OFFICIALS IN </p><p>DISASTER-PRONE AREAS ARE SAID TO BE ACUTELY AWARE THAT JOB </p><p>SECURITY DEPENDS PARTLY ON THEIR PERFORMANCE IN PREPARING </p><p>FOR AND RESPONDING TO THESE DISASTERS. </p><p> </p><p>7.

BOTH </p><p>PROJECTS ARE IMPLEMENTED BY THE DISASTER MANAGEMENT UNIT </p><p>(DMU), A UNDP-SUPPORTED TECHNICAL UNIT UNDER THE CENTRAL </p><p>COMMITTEE FOR FLOOD AND STORM CONTROL. </p><p> </p><p>8.  THE USAID/OFDA-FUNDED CENTRAL VIETNAM PROJECT HAS </p><p>ALREADY RESULTED IN REGULAR FLOOD AND STORM WARNING </p><p>BROADCASTS ON THE THREE NATIONAL TELEVISION STATIONS, AND </p><p>WILL EVENTUALLY RESULT IN STATE-OF-THE-ART FLOOD EARLY </p><p>WARNING CAPABILITIES IN SEVEN FLOOD-PRONE PROVINCES. THE </p><p>WEBSITE DEVELOPED THROUGH THIS PROJECT IS NOW THE PRIMARY </p><p>SOURCE OF DAILY AND BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON DISASTER </p><p>CONDITIONS IN VIETNAM FOR DISTRICT, PROVINCIAL, AND NATIONAL </p><p>GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, EVIDENCED BY MORE THAN 73,000 VISITS </p><p>TO THE VIETNAMESE LANGUAGE VERSION OF THE WEBSITE TO DATE. </p><p>THE WEBSITE CAN BE ACCESSED AT WWW.UNDP.ORG/DMU. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02686  02 OF 02  060950Z </p><p>9.  THROUGH THE USAID/OFDA-FUNDED COASTAL STORM EARLY </p><p>WARNING PROJECT, TECHNOLOGY IS BEING DEVELOPED TO ENABLE </p><p>VIETNAM\'S SUBSISTENCE FISHING BOATS TO RECEIVE ADEQUATE </p><p>WARNING OF APPROACHING STORMS THROUGH LOW-COST, SIGNAL- </p><p>ACTIVATED RADIO RECEIVERS. VIETNAM HAS ABOUT 80,000 </p><p>REGISTERED VESSELS ALONG ITS COASTLINE, MOST OF THEM SMALL </p><p>FISHING BOATS. THE VULNERABILITY OF THESE FISHING </p><p>COMMUNITIES TO COASTAL STORMS WAS DRAMATICALLY ILLUSTRATED </p><p>IN 1997 WHEN OVER 3,000 FISHERMEN AND WOMEN WERE LOST DURING </p><p>TYPHOON LINDA. </p><p> </p><p>10.  USAID/OFDA HAS ALSO PROVIDED EMERGENCY RELIEF THROUGH </p><p>EMBASSY HANOI IN RESPONSE TO FLOODS AND STORMS IN CENTRAL </p><p>AND SOUTHERN VIETNAM TOTALING ABOUT USD 1.3 MILLION SINCE </p><p>1999, MAINLY THROUGH THE RED CROSS AND NGOS. TWO TRAILER- </p><p>MOUNTED WATER PURIFICATION UNITS RECENTLY PROVIDED TO THE </p><p>GVN BY USAID/OFDA THROUGH CARE/VIETNAM, EACH CAPABLE OF </p><p>PRODUCING 200,000 LITERS OF DRINKING WATER DAILY, ARE NOW </p><p>BEING UTILIZED IN FLOOD-AFFECTED MEKONG COMMUNITIES. </p><p> </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p></div>
