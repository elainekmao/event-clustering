<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 RANGOON 000446 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>OFFICIAL INFORMAL </p><p> </p><p>OFFICIAL INFORMAL FOR EAP/FO DAS MATT DALEY AND EAP/BCLTV </p><p>DIRECTOR JUDITH STROTZ </p><p>JAKARTA FOR AMBASSADOR RALPH BOYCE </p><p>KUALA LUMPUR FOR POLOFF JAMES ENTWISTLE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/08/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, BM </p><p>SUBJECT: RAZALI\'S NEXT VISIT </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. TOKYO 1194 </p><p>     B. 02 RANGOON 1479 </p><p>     C. RANGOON 433 </p><p>     D. KUALA LUMPUR 1064 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: COM CARMEN M. MARTINEZ; REASON 1.5(D). </p><p> </p><p>1.(C) Summary: Reliable sources indicate that Razali\'s next </p><p>visit could be delayed until late summer and, as the Special </p><p>Envoy\'s tenth trip to Rangoon slips, so does his ability to </p><p>rescue the political dialogue. On his next visit, Razali must </p><p>have substantial meetings with the Senior General; he should </p><p>deliver a formal written message from SYG Annan expressing </p><p>disappointment with the stalemate in the political dialogue, </p><p>urging the immediate and unconditional release of all </p><p>political prisoners, and urging the implementation of </p><p>effective economic reform efforts; and he  must insist on </p><p>meeting with Aung San Suu Kyi. There is no guarantee that any </p><p>of these actions will push the SPDC down the path to </p><p>meaningful political dialogue with the opposition.  But they </p><p>can make it clear to the regime that the "comfort zone" they </p><p>have established in the region does not extend to the larger </p><p>international community.  The regime must understand that a </p><p>visible commitment to political dialogue and economic reform </p><p>is the only way to mitigate international condemnation and </p><p>address the country\'s continuing decline.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The latest word from reliable sources indicates that </p><p>Razali\'s next visit will not take place before the very end </p><p>of April or early May, and could be delayed until late </p><p>summer.  As the Special Envoy\'s tenth trip to Rangoon slips, </p><p>so does his ability to rescue the political dialogue from a </p><p>quagmire of distrust and broken promises.  Although Razali </p><p>received unanimous public statements of support at the </p><p>February ICG meeting in Tokyo (Ref A, para 5) for continuing </p><p>his mission, he had little to offer the group in the way of </p><p>new strategies to move the regime (and particularly Burma\'s </p><p>supreme ruler, Senior General Than Shwe) closer to a real </p><p>political dialogue with the opposition.  In addition, since </p><p>Razali\'s "face" with the generals is predicated on his </p><p>relationship with Malaysian Prime Minister Mahatir, he will </p><p>inevitably lose some of that face as the time draws near for </p><p>Mahatir to step down from office in October.  Signs of </p><p>Razali\'s waning prestige with the generals include the </p><p>insulting few minutes he was given with Than Shwe on his </p><p>November 2002 visit, and the regime\'s success in pressuring </p><p>him to cancel a visit to Aung San Suu Kyi. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Razali has been described by those in recent contact </p><p>with him as variously pessimistic, frustrated, or jaded.  He </p><p>definitely appears to be out of fresh ideas.  In a side </p><p>meeting with the COM and EAP/DAS Daley the morning after the </p><p>Tokyo ICG, Razali floated the idea of having SYG Annan write </p><p>a letter to Than Shwe regarding the need for political and </p><p>economic reform but then asked somewhat helplessly "But then </p><p>who could deliver it to Than Shwe?"  Given that the obvious </p><p>person to deliver such a letter would be Razali himself, his </p><p>question reinforced a sense of frustration (and perhaps his </p><p>naivet), just as when he told the assembled diplomatic corps </p><p>in November that he had just come to the realization that the </p><p>agreements with anyone in the regime, including Secretary One </p><p>Khin Nyunt, meant nothing without the final word by Than Shwe </p><p>(see Ref B, para 2). </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) It was apparent at the Tokyo ICG that Razali hopes to </p><p>use Rangoon UNDP\'s upcoming report on the results of its </p><p>"Humanitarian Review Exercise" (scheduled for summer release </p><p>to the GOB, civil society groups, the NLD and other political </p><p>parties for the consultative process before being finalized) </p><p>as a tool to break the political stalemate (Ref C, para 6). </p><p>This confirms recent information received from Razali\'s </p><p>assistant (see Ref D, para 5), but raises the concern that </p><p>the humanitarian issues could be lost in acrimony between the </p><p>NLD and the SPDC. Ralzali promoted the idea of strengthening </p><p>the NLD by including them in development of new humanitarian </p><p>aid programs and he should press the regime to allow </p><p>participation by the NLD and civil society organizations in </p><p>addressing the dire humanitarian needs of the Burmese people. </p><p>What Razali should not do is insist on making dialogue </p><p>between Aung San Suu Kyi and the Senior General/ Secretary </p><p>One an absolute condition for implementing the </p><p>recommendations that will arise from the UNDP assessment. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) We have also heard that Razali has toyed with the idea </p><p>that 2006 (when Burma takes over the chairmanship of ASEAN) </p><p>could be used as a target date for possible moves toward some </p><p>powersharing with the NLD.  This is unrealistic - the regime, </p><p>and most of all, Than Shwe, has no intention of sharing their </p><p>place in the ASEAN sun with Aung San Suu Kyi and the NLD. The </p><p>regime\'s active regional diplomacy with its ASEAN partners, </p><p>China, India, and Bangladesh plainly demonstrates its </p><p>determination to show that the regime can maintain its power </p><p>and gain regional acceptance, even legitimization, without </p><p>any concessions to the democratic opposition. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Razali used the Tokyo ICG meeting to exhort the ASEAN </p><p>members to use their good offices to push the regime to </p><p>address economic and humanitarian issues, which would in turn </p><p>impact positively on the political process.  We also </p><p>understand that in contacts with our embassy in Jakarta he </p><p>floated the idea of approaching the Indonesian government to </p><p>use their influence on the regime.  It seems Razali thinks </p><p>that perhaps the Indonesians can hold them out as an exemplar </p><p>of a military government\'s transition to democracy and </p><p>convince the SPDC that reforms are necessary.  However, we </p><p>must agree with Jakarta\'s assessment of Razali\'s idea - it </p><p>will have little resonance with the Indonesian military or </p><p>foreign ministry - just as pressuring the junta for political </p><p>or economic reform has no resonance with ASEAN as a whole. </p><p>ASEAN\'s distaste for pressuring the regime was aptly </p><p>illustrated at the Tokyo ICG where the Burmese FonMin </p><p>successfully lobbied ASEAN countries to keep their </p><p>Rangoon-based ambassadors at home (Ref  B). </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Razali has also expressed interest in a so-called </p><p>"invitation to dialogue with the U.S."  issued by the regime </p><p>a few days after the Tokyo ICG. Again, this is a misplaced </p><p>hope. This press statement, in which the regime called on the </p><p>U.S. to "join us in open, constructive dialogue towards </p><p>humanitarian, economic and political development," was never </p><p>an official overture by the junta.  In fact, after we saw it </p><p>in the foreign press, we contacted MOFA, which denied </p><p>knowledge of the statement.  Two days later, the COM spoke </p><p>personally with Secretary One (General Khin Nyunt), and the </p><p>Deputy FonMin requesting a formal opportunity to explore the </p><p>meaning of "invitation to dialogue", and the following week </p><p>the COM posed the same question to Senior General Than Shwe. </p><p> The response from all the "decision makers"?  A weak smile, </p><p>a nod, and an evasive "yes, we can discuss it."   The only </p><p>"discussion" of this "invitation to dialogue" has come from </p><p>SPDC spokesman Col. Hla Min who said what was meant was that </p><p>the regime was open to more visits by US officials as long as </p><p>they did not "come to lecture." </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)Comment: What should Razali be aiming at on his tenth </p><p>visit?  The Special Envoy is one of the few arrows that we </p><p>have in the quiver and the visit could be our last shot, so </p><p>he must be aimed directly at Senior General Than Shwe. Razali </p><p>cannot accept a dismissive meeting on the fly as he did on </p><p>his last visit - he must have substantial meetings with the </p><p>Senior General.  Razali should also deliver a formal written </p><p>message from SYG Annan expressing disappointment with the </p><p>stalemate in the political dialogue, urging the immediate and </p><p>unconditional release of all political prisoners, and urging </p><p>the implementation of effective economic reform efforts. </p><p>Razali must also insist on meeting with Aung San Suu Kyi (and </p><p>not cave in to the Senior General as both he and PM Mahatir </p><p>have done on their most recent trips).  There is no guarantee </p><p>that any of these actions will push the SPDC down the path to </p><p>dialogue with Aung San Suu Kyi.  But they can signal to the </p><p>regime that the "comfort zone" they have established in the </p><p>region does not extend to the larger international community. </p><p> The regime must understand that a visible commitment to </p><p>political dialogue and economic reform is the only way to </p><p>mitigate international condemnation and address the country\'s </p><p>continuing decline. End Comment. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
