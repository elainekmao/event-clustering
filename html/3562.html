<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001927 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PD, AF/S, AF/RA </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION WSSD; HARARE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under headline "Zim must stand its ground at </p><p>      summit" the independent weekly "The Business Tribune" </p><p>      dedicated its August 22 editorial to encouraging </p><p>      Zimbabwe to advance its controversial land </p><p>      redistribution program at the forthcoming World Summit </p><p>      on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg, South </p><p>      Africa.  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   ". . .The upcoming World Summit on Sustainable </p><p>      Development (WSSD) in Johannesburg.  What does </p><p>      it mean for Zimbabwe?  What should Zimbabwe, and </p><p>      indeed Africa, expect from the summit?  That it </p><p>      will be one of the largest and most important </p><p>      international meetings Africa has hosted is not </p><p>      in doubt. . .  For Zimbabwe, this summit, more </p><p>      than any other, presents many challenges.  These </p><p>      include the ongoing land reform program and the </p><p>      environmental concerns that it implies.  Already </p><p>      many observers and conference organizers are </p><p>      concerned the Zimbabwe contagion may derail the </p><p>      summit.  If Zimbabwe is not on the agenda it </p><p>      surely will be put at the center stage not only </p><p>      because the premise on which the land reform is </p><p>      being conducted challenges the agenda of the </p><p>      developing countries. . .  The summit thus </p><p>      provides a platform for the condemnation of land </p><p>      reform and the food problem that has now been </p><p>      conveniently associated with it.  Any country </p><p>      that attempts to identify with Zimbabwe will </p><p>      also face the wrath of the international </p><p>      community.  So any Zimbabwean delegates, </p><p>      particularly those representing the government, </p><p>      will have to endure being sidelined and </p><p>      ridiculed. . .  Zimbabwe cannot be integrated </p><p>      into the world economy when it is pursuing </p><p>      policies that undermine the foundation of modern- </p><p>      day capitalism. </p><p> </p><p>      ". . .U.S. President George W. Bush\'s millennium </p><p>      challenge account that seeks to increase </p><p>      conditional development assistance best </p><p>      describes the attitudes of the developed world </p><p>      to Africa.  AGOA and NEPAD are similar </p><p>      initiatives that rely on partnerships and </p><p>      unfettered markets as the sine qua non for </p><p>      development.  The impact of corporate greed so </p><p>      much evident in the U.S. on the lives of </p><p>      ordinary citizens will surely be ignored.  The </p><p>      thrust will certainly be driven by corporates, </p><p>      particularly those from developed countries who </p><p>      have seen these summits as a convenient platform </p><p>      to advance their selfish and parochial </p><p>      interests.  Already the composition of the </p><p>      delegates is mostly non-African, with Africans, </p><p>      in a demonstration of their world-renowned </p><p>      inability to pay for their own costs without </p><p>      donor support, missing at the summit.  The fact </p><p>      that the summit is being held in Africa but the </p><p>      majority of delegates will be advancing non- </p><p>      African values is just another example of what </p><p>      can be expected when Zimbabwe and Africa in </p><p>      general have not put their house in order." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
