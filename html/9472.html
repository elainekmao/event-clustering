(SBU) At a July 14 meeting with Assistant Air Attache and </p><p>Econoff, MFA and Civil Aviation Authority (Turkish acronym </p><p>DHMI) representatives agreed to receive a U.S. Combined Air </p><p>Operations Center (CAOC) delegation on July 24 and 25 to </p><p>arrange coordinated control of civilian air traffic between </p><p>Turkey and Iraq.  Per ref C, Embassy understands that the </p><p>CAOC group has accepted this proposal.  Vakur Gokdenizler, </p><p>MFA Deputy Director General for Maritime and Aviation </p><p>Affairs, and Ayhan Oztekin, of DHMI, raised several, </p><p>primarily technical, issues in relation to the agreement: </p><p>use of a standard International Civil Aviation Organization </p><p>(ICAO) letter of agreement (LOA) in lieu of the document </p><p>proposed by CAOC; timing for resumption of civilian flights </p><p>to Baghdad; selection criteria for the airlines; RVSM </p><p>transition from Turkey to Iraq; difficulties in telephone </p><p>communication with Iraq from Turkey; rationale for dividing </p><p>Iraq into three airspace sectors.  Per ref C, we understand </p><p>that CAOC has been in direct contact with MFA and DHMI on </p><p>several of these issues. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (S) Ref D reports that Turkish Airlines\' application to </p><p>start civilian flights to Baghdad will not be approved. </p><p>Turkish Airlines is apparently not being considered for </p><p>either the regional or interantional service to be allowed. </p><p>Embassy requests talking points explaining this decision and </p><p>strongly recommends that the CAOC team come to Ankara </p><p>prepared to discuss this issue as well. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
