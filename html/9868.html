<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KUWAIT 003556 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARP, DRL/PHD </p><p>STATE FOR INR/NESA, INR/B </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/29/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, KDEM, KWMN, PINR, PHUM, KU </p><p>SUBJECT: GOK CLAIMS INTENT TO EXPAND SUFFRAGE, WELCOMES </p><p>TRAINING FOR JUDGES </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: ADCM John G. Moran for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary:  On July 26, the Ambassador met with the new </p><p>government\'s Minister of Justice, Ahmed Baquer Al-Abdullah, </p><p>who gave him a readout on some of the governments upcoming </p><p>plans.  Among the specific items discussed were the GOK\'s </p><p>commitment to womens suffrage, the possible lowering of the </p><p>voting age from 21 to 18 and the possibility of USG-provided </p><p>training for Kuwaiti judges.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>EXPANDING THE VOTE </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) During their July 26 meeting, the Ambassador and </p><p>Minister of Justice Ahmed Baquer Al-Abdullah discussed the </p><p>expansion of voting rights in Kuwait.  Baquer said that while </p><p>the government was committed to resubmitting a proposal to </p><p>expand suffrage to women (Note: The last proposal was voted </p><p>down by the National Assembly in 1999.  End Note.), he was </p><p>doubtful that the GOK would gain the necessary 32 votes for </p><p>passage from the new National Assembly.  As if to prove the </p><p>point, Baquer then proceeded to read the names of every </p><p>National Assembly Member and their suspected and/or known </p><p>position on the issue, adding that the GOK would only be able </p><p>to secure 27 votes (Comment: Baquer, the only elected MP in </p><p>the new Cabinet, is a Salafi Islamist.  He retains the </p><p>Justice portfolio he held in the last Cabinet, but no longer </p><p>holds the Awqaf and Islamic Affairs portfolio.  End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Noting that there were other ways to expand the </p><p>electoral base, the Ambassador suggested that the GOK might </p><p>also consider dropping the voting age from 21 to 18 and </p><p>allowing the military and security personnel to vote.  In the </p><p>case of women\'s suffrage, it should consider challenging the </p><p>election law as unconstitutional (Note: Kuwait\'s constitution </p><p>guarantees the equality of all citizens, although many of its </p><p>laws make distinctions between men and women.  End note.). </p><p>Baquer replied that lowering the voting age had been </p><p>discussed since the 1970\'s, and there was a general societal </p><p>consensus that "18 is too young."  With respect to the </p><p>military, he said Kuwait has a tradition of keeping the </p><p>military out of politics, and would likely not find such an </p><p>expansion acceptable.  Finally, Baquer called GOK legal </p><p>action against the law "a big problem," because many of </p><p>Kuwait\'s laws differentiate between men and women.  "Islamic </p><p>Sharia," which Kuwait\'s laws are partially based upon, </p><p>"always distinguishes between men and women," he said. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The Ambassador pointed out that the Constitution </p><p>stated Sharia was "a basis," i.e not the only basis, for </p><p>Kuwaiti law.  Elections and other laws not directly adapted </p><p>from Sharia should be changed to comply with the </p><p>Constitution.  Baquer said this was one example of the </p><p>challenge facing the Islamic world.  "The Islamic world needs </p><p>to choose between the East or West," he said.  Completely </p><p>ignoring the issue of constitutionality, he added, "The West </p><p>doesn\'t distinguish between men and women at all."  Later, </p><p>attempting to explain the fact that Kuwait is the last voting </p><p>country in the world that still has not extended the vote to </p><p>women, Baquer said Islamic scholars had opposed womens </p><p>suffrage in Muslim countries, but "it was imposed on them." </p><p> </p><p>JUDGE TRAINING WELCOMED </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) The Minister was much more open to the Ambassador\'s </p><p>offer of USG assistance in providing Kuwait\'s judges with </p><p>training on internationally accepted standards, especially </p><p>for the protection of intellectual prooerty rights.  Baquer </p><p>called such training "a good idea" and said the issue should </p><p>be taken up again after the current 3-month judiciary holiday </p><p>is over. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Before the election, Shaykh Sabah, who is now Prime </p><p>Minister, publicly pledged a fresh push on women\'s rights. </p><p>The clear opposition of his own Justice Minister shows what </p><p>an uphill struggle it will be. </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
