<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ZAGREB 000094 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/14/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREF, PHUM, PREL, HR, PHUM, PREL, HR, OSCEPREF, UNHCR, OSCE, Refugee </p><p>SUBJECT: 2003:  CRITICAL YEAR FOR RETURNS TO CROATIA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: POLITICAL OFFICER DARREN TAYLOR, REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) CUTS IN THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY\'S PRESENCE AND </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00094  01 OF 02  141716Z </p><p>FUNDING IN CROATIA WILL MAKE THIS YEAR CRITICAL FOR REFUGEE </p><p>RETURNS.  OVER THE NEXT 12 MONTHS, A BUDGET-STRAPPED UNHCR </p><p>WILL DRAW DOWN ITS IN-COUNTRY OPERATIONS, REDUCING STAFF BY </p><p>60 PERCENT.  KEY PRM-AND EU-FUNDED PROGRAMS ARE SET TO SHUT </p><p>DOWN.  THESE DEVELOPMENTS ARE OCCURRING EVEN AS THE NUMBER OF </p><p>RETURNS IN 2002 DECREASED COMPARED TO 2001 LEVELS.  THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY MUST USE ALL ITS LEVERAGE IN THE </p><p>CLOSING WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY TO PUSH THE GOC TO PROMOTE </p><p>RETURNS BEFORE THE IMPACT OF UNHCR\'S DOWNSIZING AND LOSS OF </p><p>KEY PROGRAMS IS FELT.  THE BURDEN OF PROMOTING, FACILITATING </p><p>AND FUNDING REFUGEE RETURNS IS INCREASINGLY FALLING ON THE </p><p>SHOULDERS OF THE GOC, BUT ALL EXPERIENCE ARGUES THAT THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT WILL NOT VIEW RETURNS WITH ANY SENSE OF COMMITMENT </p><p>OR URGENCY -- PARTICULARLY AS GENERAL ELECTIONS APPROACH. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>UNHCR SAYS TIME IS NOT ON ITS SIDE </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  "THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY HAS EXACTLY ONE YEAR </p><p>TO MAKE A BIG PUSH ON REFUGEE RETURNS."  THIS WAS HOW UNHCR\'S </p><p>TALENTED CHIEF OF MISSION, OLUSEYI BAJULAIYE, SUMMED UP THE </p><p>SITUATION FOR US RECENTLY.  THE UNHCR MISSION IN CROATIA IS </p><p>PLANNING TO REDUCE ITS FIELD PRESENCE DRASTICALLY AND PHASE </p><p>OUT MOST OF ITS RETURN-RELATED ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS BY THE END </p><p>OF 2003.  FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL MONTHS, IT WILL MAINTAIN A </p><p>HEADQUARTERS IN ZAGREB AND THREE FIELD OFFICES IN OSIJEK, </p><p>KNIN, AND SISAK, WITH A TOTAL OF ABOUT 80 STAFF.  UNHCR\'S </p><p>STAFF WILL BE CUT BY 60 PERCENT BY THE END OF THE YEAR, WHICH </p><p>WILL MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR UNHCR TO MONITOR REFUGEE </p><p>DEVELOPMENTS AND SUPPORT RETURNS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00094  01 OF 02  141716Z </p><p>SENIOR UNHCR OFFICIALS, HOWEVER, NOTE THAT THE RETURN PROCESS </p><p>IS FAR FROM OVER; THERE ARE CURRENTLY 228,000 CROATIAN SERB </p><p>REFUGEES IN THE FRY AND ANOTHER 23,000 IN REPUBLIKA SRPSKA IN </p><p>BOSNIA, OF WHOM UNHCR ESTIMATES THAT AT LEAST 30 PERCENT </p><p>WOULD LIKE TO RETURN TO CROATIA UNDER THE RIGHT CONDITIONS. </p><p> </p><p>3.   (SBU) BAJULAIYE AND OTHER SENIOR UNHCR OFFICIALS </p><p>RECENTLY CAUTIONED THAT BUDGETARY SHORTFALLS COULD FORCE THE </p><p>MISSION TO IMPLEMENT PLANNED CUTS SOONER THAN INITIALLY </p><p>EXPECTED.  FUNDING FOR ITS REQUESTED 7.8 MILLION USD BUDGET </p><p>THIS YEAR HAS NOT BEEN SECURED.  OF THAT AMOUNT, 5.5 MILLION </p><p>USD WOULD BE USED FOR PROGRAM ACTIVITIES INCLUDING RETURN AND </p><p>REPATRIATION, REGISTERING REFUGEES AND INTERNALLY DISPLACED </p><p>PERSONS IN BOSNIA AND THE FRY, PROVIDING LEGAL ASSISTANCE, </p><p>AND HANDLING ASYLUM CASES.  APPEALS HAVE BEEN MADE TO THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY FOR FUNDING TO ENSURE THAT UNHCR CAN </p><p>SATISFACTORILY CONCLUDE ITS MANDATE FOR CROATIA UNDER THE </p><p>DAYTON PEACE ACCORDS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) TO USE INCREASINGLY SCARCE RESOURCES MORE </p><p>EFFICIENTLY, UNHCR HAS BEGUN TO COOPERATE MORE CLOSELY WITH </p><p>THE OSCE ON KEY ISSUES RELATED TO REFUGEE RETURNS.  UNHCR AND </p><p>OSCE MISSIONS ARE PRODUCING JOINT MONITORING REPORTS </p><p>REGARDING THE GOC\'S PERFORMANCE IN IMPLEMENTING LEGISLATION </p><p>AND MEETING SELF-IMPOSED DEADLINES ON REFUGEE-RELATED ISSUES. </p><p> THIS GREATER COORDINATION, OFFICIALS AT BOTH ORGANIZATIONS </p><p>HAVE TOLD US, WILL HELP THE ORGANIZATIONS MONITOR </p><p>DEVELOPMENTS BETTER IN THE FIELD AND TO PRESSURE THE GOC TO </p><p>TAKE ACTION ON PROPERTY ISSUES TO CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT </p><p>CONDUCIVE TO PROMOTING RETURNS.  IN ADDITION, UNHCR HAS BEGUN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00094  01 OF 02  141716Z </p><p>THE PROCESS OF IMPROVING THE CAPACITY BUILDING OF KEY NGOS TO </p><p>ALLOW THEM GRADUALLY TO TAKE OVER SOME UNHCR </p><p>RESPONSIBILITIES.  GREATER COORDINATION WITH UNHCR AND OSCE </p><p>MISSIONS IN THE FRY AND BIH IS ALSO UNDERWAY. </p><p> </p><p>PRM AND EU FUNDING ALSO SET TO END </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) AS UNHCR IS PREPARING TO REDUCE ITS ROLE, PRM </p><p>FUNDING, WHICH HAS BEEN CRITICAL IN SUPPORTING RETURNS </p><p>THROUGHOUT CROATIA, WILL END IN JUNE.  PRM\'S BUDGET FOR </p><p>CROATIA COVERING PROGRAMS FROM MAY 2002 TO JUNE 2003 IS </p><p>SLIGHTLY OVER 3 MILLION USD.  ENDING THE PROGRAMS PROVIDED BY </p><p>PRM\'S FOUR IMPLEMENTING PARTNERS -- AMERICAN REFUGEE </p><p>COMMITTEE (ARC), CATHOLIC RELIEF SERVICES (CRS), </p><p>INTERNATIONAL CATHOLIC MIGRATION COMMISSION (ICMC), AND THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL RESCUE COMMITTEE (IRC) -- WILL LEAVE A MAJOR </p><p>GAP IN PROVIDING KEY SERVICES TO REFUGEES.  THE SERVICES </p><p>INCLUDE GRANTING SMALL-SCALE HOUSING REPAIRS, FOOD AID </p><p>PACKAGES, PROVIDING LEGAL ASSISTANCE, AND OTHER HOUSEHOLD </p><p>ITEMS AIMED AT PROVIDING IMMEDIATE SUPPORT TO THOSE WHO </p><p>RETURN. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) PRM PARTNERS, SUCH AS IRC AND ICMC, ARE ALSO </p><p>INVOLVED IN FACILITATING CROSS-BORDER RETURNS FROM BIH AND </p><p>THE FRY.  WITH THE CLOSURE OF PRM-FUNDED PROGRAMS IN JUNE, </p><p>CROSS-BORDER RETURNS WILL BE DRAMATICALLY AFFECTED DURING THE </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ7570 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  00094  02 OF 02  141709Z </p><p>ACTION PRM-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   CIAE-00  INL-00   DODE-00  DOTE-00 </p><p>      PERC-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00   OIGO-00  FAAE-00 </p><p>      FBIE-00  VC-00    HHS-01   H-01     SSA-01   TEDE-00  INR-00 </p><p>      IO-00    LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00 </p><p>      OIC-02   OMB-01   DHS-00   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00 </p><p>      ACE-00   P-00     SCT-00   SP-00    IRM-00   SSO-00   SS-00 </p><p>      STR-00   TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00  ECA-00   PMB-00   DSCC-00 </p><p>      DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00    /011W </p><p>                  ------------------255021  141710Z /38 </p><p>O 141657Z JAN 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 9197 </p><p>INFO EUROPEAN POLITICAL COLLECTIVE </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 ZAGREB 000094 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/14/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREF, PHUM, PREL, HR, UNHCR, OSCE </p><p>SUBJECT: 2003:  CRITICAL YEAR FOR RETURNS TO CROATIA </p><p> </p><p>HEIGHT OF RETURN SEASON.  MOST IMPORTANTLY, MANY OF THE PRM </p><p>IMPLEMENTING PARTNERS WILL HAVE TO CLOSE ONCE THE FUNDING </p><p>RUNS OUT.  SOME PRM PARTNERS, HOWEVER, WILL CONTINUE TO </p><p>RECEIVE FUNDING FROM OTHER SOURCES.  THE LOSS OF THEIR </p><p>PRESENCE IN POTENTIAL RETURN COMMUNITIES WILL ONLY SERVE TO </p><p>MAKE REFUGEES MORE RELUCTANT TO RETURN.  MANY REFUGEE </p><p>COMMUNITIES HAVE A FAVORABLE VIEW OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS AND </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00094  02 OF 02  141709Z </p><p>ARE WILLING TO RETURN BECAUSE THEY HAVE RECEIVED DIRECT </p><p>ASSISTANCE FROM THEM. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) ANOTHER KEY IC INITIATIVE THAT WILL BE WRAPPING UP </p><p>BY THE END OF 2003 IS THE EU\'S HOUSING CONSTRUCTION PROGRAM, </p><p>WHICH HAS HAD A MAJOR IMPACT ON RETURNS THUS FAR.  THE EU </p><p>DESIGNATED 10 MILLION USD FOR THE PROGRAM LAST YEAR FOR THE </p><p>CONSTRUCTION OF 1000 HOMES, ALMOST 400 OF WHICH WERE </p><p>COMPLETED BY THE END OF 2002.  THE REMAINING 600 WILL LIKELY </p><p>BE COMPLETED BY THE END OF THIS YEAR.  LOCAL EC OFFICIALS </p><p>STRESS THAT THE PROGRAM, WHICH WILL AID IN THE EVENTUAL </p><p>RETURN OF ABOUT 4,000 REFUGEES, WILL NOT BE EXTENDED BEYOND </p><p>THIS YEAR.  THEREFORE, THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR HOUSING </p><p>CONSTRUCTION AND RECONSTRUCTION WILL FALL SOLELY ON THE GOC, </p><p>WHICH ESTIMATES THAT THE TOTAL COST WILL BE UP TO 800 MILLION </p><p>USD.  GOC OFFICIALS CONTINUE TO STRESS THAT THIS IS A </p><p>SUBSTANTIAL BURDEN FOR A COUNTRY WITH AN ANNUAL BUDGET OF </p><p>ABOUT 10 BILLION USD. </p><p> </p><p>RETURNS LEVELING OFF </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) THE REDUCTION OF INTERNATIONAL PERSONNEL AND </p><p>FUNDING FOR REFUGEE-RELATED ISSUES IS COMING AT A TIME WHEN </p><p>ACTUAL RETURNS ARE ALSO LEVELING OFF.  IN 2002, AROUND 11,000 </p><p>REFUGEES RETURNED TO CROATIA.  THIS IS COMPARED TO ABOUT </p><p>12,000 RETURNS IN 2001, ACCORDING TO UNHCR FIGURES.  ONE OF </p><p>THE MORE POSITIVE TRENDS NOTED LAST YEAR WAS THE RETURN OF </p><p>YOUNGER REFUGEES, IN CONTRAST TO THE USUAL FLOW OF </p><p>PENSIONERS.  UNHCR ESTIMATES THAT AT LEAST 20,000 REFUGEES </p><p>WOULD RETURN THIS YEAR IF THE GOC MADE PROGRESS ON </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00094  02 OF 02  141709Z </p><p>REPOSSESSION AND RECONSTRUCTION OF PROPERTY.  THIS FIGURE </p><p>COULD INCREASE IF KEY ISSUES SUCH AS OCCUPANCY/TENANCY RIGHTS </p><p>AND SOCIAL SECURITY ENTITLEMENTS WERE ADDRESSED. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>9.   (C) A REDUCTION IN UNHCR\'S ROLE IN CROATIA HAS BEEN </p><p>ANTICIPATED FOR SOME WHILE.  IN JUNE 2002, AFTER HIS CUTOFF </p><p>THREAT SHOCK TACTIC, HIGH COMMISSIONER RUUD LUBBERS DESCRIBED </p><p>2003 AS THE FINAL YEAR OF UNHCR\'S DIRECT INVOLVEMENT IN THE </p><p>RETURN PROCESS IN CROATIA.  WHAT HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY </p><p>APPARENT IN RECENT MONTHS IS THAT MANY OF THE NGOS </p><p>IMPLEMENTING UNHCR PROGRAMS WILL BE SEVERELY AFFECTED BY THE </p><p>LACK OF FUNDING ONCE UNHCR COMPLETES ITS DRAW-DOWN.  THE </p><p>ADDITIONAL BURDEN THAT SOME OF THESE NGOS WILL FEEL BECAUSE </p><p>OF THE LOSS OF PRM-FUNDED CONTRACTS WILL MAKE IT DIFFICULT </p><p>FOR THEM TO SURVIVE IN CROATIA.  SOME ARE ALREADY PLANNING TO </p><p>LEAVE, WHICH WILL DRAMATICALLY AFFECT THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>COMMUNITY\'S ABILITY TO DELIVER SERVICES TO RETURNING </p><p>REFUGEES.  THEIR DEPARTURE WILL ALSO RAISE DOUBTS AMONG </p><p>REFUGEES CURRENTLY IN THE FRY AND BIH OVER WHETHER THEY </p><p>SHOULD RETURN. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) GOC LEADERS FREQUENTLY TELL US THEY WELCOME THE </p><p>RETURN OF REFUGEES, BUT THEIR ACTIONS DO NOT SUPPORT THEIR </p><p>RHETORIC.  THE DOWNSIZING OF UNHCR AND LOSS OF KEY </p><p>REFUGEE-RELATED ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS WILL PLACE AN INCREASED </p><p>BURDEN ON THE GOC TO PROVIDE CARE FOR ALL OF ITS CITIZENS, </p><p>PARTICULARLY THE MOST VULNERABLE.  JUDGING BY THE GOC\'S TRACK </p><p>RECORD, WE SEE NO REASON FOR OPTIMISM. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00094  02 OF 02  141709Z </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) WE WILL INCREASE COORDINATION WITH OTHER </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY PARTNERS TO ACCELERATE THE RETURN </p><p>PROCESS WHILE THERE IS STILL TIME.  THE AMBASSADOR, ALONG </p><p>WITH HIS COUNTERPARTS FROM THE UN, EU, OSCE AND UNHCR, ARE </p><p>SEEKING A SECOND MEETING WITH PM RACAN TO GAIN HIS COMMITMENT </p><p>TO RESOLVING REFUGEE ISSUES AND TO CLARIFY HOW THE GOC PLANS </p><p>TO ADDRESS REFUGEE-RELATED ISSUES IN THE WAKE OF A DECLINING </p><p>INTERNATIONAL PRESENCE.  WHILE WE WILL KEEP THE PRESSURE ON </p><p>HERE, WE WILL NEED EU AND NATO OFFICIALS IN BRUSSELS AND </p><p>OTHER CAPITALS TO STRNGTHEN OUR HAND BY SENDING A CLEAR </p><p>MESSAGE TO THE GOC THAT EU AND NATO MEMBERSHIP WILL REMAIN A </p><p>DISTANT GOAL UNTIL SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS IS MADE ON REFUGEE </p><p>RETURNS.  THERE WILL BE AMPLE OPPORTUNITIES TO DELIVER SUCH A </p><p>MESSAGE OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL WEEKS WHEN GOC OFFICIALS BEGIN </p><p>TO VISIT EU CAPITALS TO PRESENT THEIR CASE FOR EU MEMBERSHIP. </p><p> GOC OFFICIALS CONTINUE TO INSIST THAT CROATIA WILL SUBMIT IT </p><p>APPLICATION FOR EU MEMBERSHIP BY EARLY SPRING. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (U) BELGRADE MINIMIZE CONSIDERED. </p><p>ROSSIN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
