<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 04 BOGOTA 07890 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS: KPRP, PINS, MILI, PTER, CO </p><p>SUBJECT: THE GUERRILLA SITUATION: PREPARING FOR WAR? </p><p> </p><p>REF: BOGOTA 3997 </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY.  COLOMBIA\'S GUERRILLA WAR HAS BEEN </p><p>QUIESCENT THE LAST FEW WEEKS.  THOUGH ARMED CONTACTS </p><p>BETWEEN THE VARIOUS GUERRILLA GROUPS AND THE MILITARY </p><p>CONTINUE, THE PACE OF MAJOR CONFRONTATIONS HAS </p><p>SLACKENED.  THE MAIN ARENA OF CONFRONTATION HAS BEEN THE </p><p>MEDIA, WHERE THE UNION PATRIOTICA (UP), POLITICAL FRONT </p><p>OF THE COLOMBIAN REVOLUTIONARY ARMED FORCES (FARC), </p><p>LEVELED CHARGES OF HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES AGAINST THE </p><p>MILITARY.  COLOMBIA\'S GUERRILLA GROUPS ARE IN A </p><p>RETRENCHMENT PHASE: REGROUPING, FORGING ALLIANCES, AND </p><p>RETHINKING STRATEGIES.  THE GOC CONTINUES TO </p><p>RESTRUCTURE ITS SECURITY APPARATUS AND TO AUGMENT THE </p><p>ARMY\'S STRENGTH THROUGH RECRUITMENT OF VOLUNTEER UNITS. </p><p>THERE ARE INDICATIONS THAT BOTH SIDES ARE PREPARING FOR </p><p>AN EVENTUAL BREAKDOWN OF THE PEACE PROCESS AND THE </p><p>RESUMPTION OF FULL-SCALE CONFLICT.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GUERRILLAS - THE PUBLIC PROFILE </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>2. (S/NF) WAVING THE HUMAN RIGHTS BANNER:  THE FARC AND </p><p>THE UNION PATRIOTICA ARE THE ONE COLOMBIAN GUERRILLA </p><p>GROUPING POSSESSED OF A MEDIA SENSE.  IN RECENT WEEKS, </p><p>THEY HAVE USED THE MEDIA TO MAKE THEIR CASE TO THE </p><p>COLOMBIAN AND FOREIGN PUBLIC.  THE MAJOR THRUST BY THE </p><p>UP WAS A MAY 8 PRESS CONFERENCE IN WHICH EX-PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>CANDIDATE JAIME PARDO LEAL CHARGED OVER 100 MILITARY </p><p>OFFICERS WITH HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES AGAINST UP MEMBERS AND </p><p>ACTIVISTS (SEE BOGOTA 6456).  THE UP\'S CHARGES RESULTED </p><p>IN A SWIFT DENIAL AND A NAME-BY-NAME REBUTTAL BY DEFENSE </p><p>MINISTER SAMUDIO.  PARDO\'S THRUST WAS COMPLEMENTED BY </p><p>REPORTS OF A PARIS PRESS CONFERENCE IN WHICH UP </p><p>CONGRESSMAN AND EX-FARC COMANDANTE BRAULIO HERRERA </p><p>DECLARED THE UP AND THE PEACE PROCESS TO BE IN DANGER OF </p><p>EXTINCTION FROM ASSAULTS BY THE MILITARY AND </p><p>MILITARY-SUPPORTED PARA-MILITARY GROUPS (SEE BOGOTA </p><p>7001).  HERRERA\'S PARIS SOJOURN IS PROBABLY THE OPENING </p><p>PHASE OF A LARGE SCALE PROPAGANDA CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE </p><p>COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT AND SECURITY FORCES.  SPECIAL </p><p>REPORTING INDICATES THAT THE COLOMBIAN COMMUNIST PARTY </p><p>(PCC) IS COORDINATING SUCH A CAMPAIGN WITH LEFTIST </p><p>GROUPS IN LATIN AMERICA AND EUROPE.  THE CAMPAIGN IS TO </p><p>BE MODELED ON THOSE CONDUCTED AGAINST THE GOVERNMENTS OF </p><p>EL SALVADOR, GUATEMALA, AND ARGENTINA.  ANALOGY BETWEEN </p><p>ARGENTINA\'S "DIRTY WAR" AND CONTEMPORARY COLOMBIA WILL </p><p>BE THE KEY THEME.  THE ULTIMATE OBJECTIVE IS TO </p><p>CONSTRAIN GOC ACTIONS AGAINST ANY GUERRILLA GROUP AND TO </p><p>FRUSTRATE ATTEMPTS TO SECURE COUNTER-INSURGENCY SUPPORT </p><p>FROM ABROAD. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) PARDO ON THE PEACE PROCESS: FOLLOWING ON THE </p><p>CHARGES OF MILITARY HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES, THE </p><p>CONSERVATIVE WEEKLY "GUION" PUBLISHED AN INTERVIEW WITH </p><p>PARDO IN ITS MAY 27 EDITION.  AFTER THE NOW-RITUAL </p><p>DECLARATION OF THE UP\'S INDEPENDENCE FROM THE FARC, </p><p>PARDO WENT ON TO DENOUNCE THE BARCO ADMINISTRATION\'S </p><p>CONDUCT OF THE PEACE PROCESS.  HE DECLARED THE PROCESS </p><p>TO BE IN CRISIS BECAUSE THE GOC LACKS THE WILL TO BUILD </p><p>ON THE BASE CREATED BY THE BETANCUR ADMINISTRATION.  IN </p><p>PARTICULAR, HE CITED THE GOC\'S REFUSAL TO NAME AN </p><p>INDEPENDENT VERIFICATION COMMISSION AS PROOF OF A LACK </p><p>OF INTEREST IN PEACE.  "THE GOVERNMENT," PARDO </p><p>CONTINUED, "HAS NOT MOVED A SINGLE FINGER TO PUT AN END </p><p>TO...ARMED CONFRONTATIONS BETWEEN THE ARMY AND THE </p><p>GUERRILLA MOVEMENT OBSERVING THE TRUCE."  HE ALSO </p><p>CRITICIZED THE GOVERNMENT CONTENTION THAT THE ARMED </p><p>FORCES MUST HAVE FREE ACCESS TO ANY PART OF THE </p><p>COUNTRY.  CHALLENGED THAT THE TREATY DID NOT CONCEDE </p><p>"INDEPENDENT REPUBLICS" TO THE FARC, PARDO COUNTERED </p><p>THAT "THE FARC NEEDS A GEOGRAPHICAL SITE, A PIECE OF </p><p>EARTH." </p><p> </p><p>4. (U)  A LETTER TO BARCO:  THE UP\'S EFFORTS WERE </p><p>COMPLEMENTED BY DESPATCH MAY 10 OF A LETTER FROM THE </p><p>FARC COMANDANTES TO PRESIDENT BARCO.  REVEALING A NEW </p><p>AGGRESSIVENESS TOWARD THE GOVERNMENT, THE FARC WARNED </p><p>THAT THE FATE OF THE PEACE PROCESS IS IN BARCO\'S HANDS. </p><p>SIGNIFICANTLY, THE FARC DECLARED THAT THEY DID NOT SIGN </p><p>A TRUCE WITH "MILITARISM" AND ARE READY TO JOIN "OUR </p><p>PEOPLE WHEN IT DECIDES TO RISE UP AGAINST MILITARISM." </p><p>THE FARC\'S LETTER CONTAINS AN IMPLICIT THREAT: SHOULD </p><p>BARCO BECOME "MILITARISTIC" IN THE FARC\'S EYES, THE </p><p>GUERRILLAS WILL HAVE THE LEGAL RIGHT TO ABANDON THE </p><p>PEACE PROCESS AND RESUME OPERATIONS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GUERRILLAS - BEHIND THE SCENES MANEUVERING </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>5. (C/NF) FARC - STIRRING FROM THE NEST:  WHILE THE </p><p>FARC\'S PUBLIC ORGANS ARE ENGAGED IN TARRING THEIR </p><p>GOC/MILITARY OPPONENTS, THE FARC AND COLOMBIA\'S OTHER </p><p>GUERRILLA ARMIES, SINGLY OR IN CONCERT, HAVE BUSIED </p><p>THEMSELVES WITH REORGANIZATION, ALLIANCES, AND STRATEGIC </p><p>RETHINKING.  AS THE LARGEST GUERRILLA ARMY, AND THE SOLE </p><p>GROUP REMAINING WITHIN THE PEACE PROCESS, THE FARC\'S </p><p>ACTIVITIES COMMAND THE LION\'S SHARE OF INTEREST.  RECENT </p><p>REPORTING SUGGESTS THAT THE FARC IS REDISTRIBUTING </p><p>FORCES, POSSIBLY WITH AN EYE TO READINESS IN EVENT OF AN </p><p>OPEN BREAK WITH THE GOC.  ONE MILITARY SOURCE REPORTS </p><p>THAT FIVE ADDITIONAL FARC FRONTS ARE BEING FORMED.  IT </p><p>IS UNCLEAR WHETHER THIS PROJECTED EXPANSION REFLECTS </p><p>ADDITIONAL ARMED STRENGTH, A REDISTRIBUTION OF AVAILABLE </p><p>STRENGTH TO COUNTER GOC INITIATIVES, OR A RESPONSE TO </p><p>RIVAL GUERRILLA GROUPS.  HOWEVER, GIVEN THE GROWTH IN </p><p>FARC STRENGTH SINCE THE INCEPTION OF THE PEACE PROCESS, </p><p>IT FAIR TO ASSUME THAT THE NEW FRONTS REFLECT </p><p>AUGMENTATION OF THE FARC\'S ARMED STRENGTH.  BY CONTRAST, </p><p>OTHER SPECIAL REPORTING SUGGESTS THAT THE FARC IS </p><p>CONSOLIDATING FRONTS IN ANTICIPATION OF THE MARCH 1988 </p><p>ELECTIONS.  ANOTHER FACET OF THE SITUATION IS A JUNE 2 </p><p>REPORT IN "EL ESPECTADOR", BOGOTA\'S LEADING DAILY, THAT </p><p>THE FARC IS ABANDONING ITS MOUNTAIN HEADQUARTERS AT LA </p><p>URIBE AND SHIFTING FORCES TO META AND GUAVIARE </p><p>DEPARTMENTS.  THIS REPORT REMAINS UNCONFIRMED; GOC </p><p>OFFICIALS PLED IGNORANCE WHEN PRESSED BY THE MEDIA FOR </p><p>CONFIRMATION.  IT SEEMS UNLIKELY THAT THE FARC WOULD </p><p>LEAVE INACCESSIBLE LA URIBE FOR NEW AND UNHARDENED </p><p>QUARTERS.  ANY SHIFT OF PERSONNEL FROM LA URIBE MAY IN </p><p>FACT BE TIED TO THE ACTIVATION OF NEW FRONTS. </p><p> </p><p>6. (S/NF) EXTENDING A HAND TO THE EPL: WHILE CONTINUING </p><p>TO SPAR WITH THE GOC ON THE PEACE PROCESS, THE FARC HAS </p><p>NOT ABANDONED ITS HOPES OF DOMINATING COLOMBIA\'S </p><p>GUERRILLA MOVEMENT.  A MAJOR STEP IN THIS DIRECTION WAS </p><p>THE APRIL 4 AGREEMENT WITH THE PEOPLE\'S LIBERATION ARMY </p><p>(EPL) WHICH CALLED FOR GUERRILLA UNITY, "DEMOCRATIC </p><p>CONVERGENCE" AND POLITICAL SOLUTIONS TO COLOMBIA\'S </p><p>PROBLEMS.  CONFIDENTIAL REPORTING SUGGESTS THAT EACH </p><p>SIDE SEES ADVANTAGES FLOWING FROM THE PACT.  THE FARC </p><p>FORESEES A NOMINAL TRUCE BETWEEN THE GOC AND THE EPL </p><p>WHICH WOULD ALLOW INCREASED EPL TO INCREASE POLITICAL </p><p>ACTIVITY IN ITS CORDOBA DEPARTMENT STRONGHOLD -- AN </p><p>ADVANTAGE FOR THE RADICAL LEFT.  THEY ALSO VIEW THE PACT </p><p>AS AN INCENTIVE FOR OTHER GUERRILLA GROUPS TO NEGOTIATE </p><p>WITH THE FARC.  FOR ITS PART, THE EPL SEES THE AGREEMENT </p><p>AS A MEANS OF LURING THE FARC OUT OF THE PEACE PROCESS. </p><p>THUS, THE AGREEMENT COULD SUCCUMB TO THE DISTRUST AND </p><p>IDEOLOGICAL SQUABBLING THAT HAVE KEPT COLOMBIA\'S </p><p>GUERRILLAS DIVIDED. </p><p> </p><p>7. (S/NF) EXTENDING A FIST TO THE ELN: DESPITE SUCCESS </p><p>IN FORGING LINKS TO THE EPL, TENSIONS BETWEEN THE FARC </p><p>AND THE NATIONAL LIBERATION ARMY (ELN) HAVE ESCALATED. </p><p>IN PARTICULAR, THE FARC HAS ACCUSED THE ELN OF MURDERING </p><p>MEMBERS OF THE FARC\'S UNION PATRIOTICA (UP) POLITICAL </p><p>FRONT IN ARAUCA INTENDENCY.  THE SITUATION MIRRORS THE </p><p>CONFLICTING AMBITIONS OF THE TWO GROUPS IN THAT AREA. </p><p>WHILE THE FARC REMAINS INTENT ON MONOPOLIZING POLITICAL </p><p>POWER IN ARAUCA, AND USING THE AREA AS A RECRUITING </p><p>POOL, THE ELN SEEKS TO DOMINATE THE AREA THROUGH ATTACKS </p><p>ON THE OIL PIPELINE.  CONFIDENTIAL REPORTING INDICATES </p><p>THAT THE ELN DESIRES A MEETING TO RESOLVE THESE </p><p>PROBLEMS.  IT IS UNKNOWN IF SUCH A MEETING OCCURRED, BUT </p><p>NEW DEVELOPMENTS SUGGEST THAT THE FARC AND THE ELN HAVE </p><p>TEMPORARILY SHELVED THEIR DIFFERENCES. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) ONE FOR ALL, ALL FOR ONE:  THE NEW DEVELOPMENT </p><p>SUGGESTING A SUBSUMPTION OF FARC-ELN DIFFERENCES IS THE </p><p>GENERAL STRIKE CALLED FOR JUNE 7-9.  THIS STRIKE, </p><p>DESIGNED TO PARALYZE SEVEN DEPARTMENTS OF NORTHEASTERN </p><p>COLOMBIA, WAS JOINTLY SPONSORED BY THE FARC, THE </p><p>PEOPLE\'S LIBERATION ARMY (EPL), THE M-19, THE NATIONAL </p><p>LIBERATION ARMY (ELN), AND THE NEWLY-REACTIVATED RICARDO </p><p>FRANCO FRONT (A DISSIDENT WING OF THE FARC). </p><p>VICE-MINISTER OF GOVERNMENT FERNANDO BOTERO TOLD MISSION </p><p>JUNE 9 THAT THE STRIKE HAS NOT ASSUMED THE DIMENSIONS </p><p>ORIGINALLY FEARED.  URBAN WORKERS HAVE LARGELY IGNORED </p><p>CALLS TO TAKE TO THE STREETS.  BOTERO ADDED THAT ABOUT </p><p>18,000 CAMPESINOS HAVE BEEN MOBILIZED UNDER DURESS BY </p><p>THE GUERRILLAS, THREATENED WITH A 20,000 PESO FINE OR </p><p>DEATH FOR NON-COMPLIANCE.  WHILE SATISFIED THAT THE </p><p>STRIKE\'S IMMEDIATE IMPACT IS MINIMAL, BOTERO COMMENTED </p><p>THAT THE EVIDENT GUERRILLA COOPERATION IN FOMENTING THE </p><p>CAMPESINO MARCHES IS DISTURBING (COMMENT: WE SHARE </p><p>BOTERO\'S CONCERN; WHATEVER THE SUCCESS OF THE CIVIC </p><p>STRIKE, ITS PLANNING POINTS TOWARD POSSIBLE GREATER </p><p>COOPERATION AMONG THE GUERRILLAS.) </p><p> </p><p>9. (S/NF) M-19 -- THROWING THEIR HAT IN THE RING: THE </p><p>FARC IS NOT ALONE IN RETHINKING ITS POSITION AND IN </p><p>RESTRUCTURING ITS FORCES.  CONFIDENTIAL REPORTING </p><p>INDICATES THAT THE LONG-UNHEARD-FROM M-19 HAS DECIDED TO </p><p>PARTICIPATE IN THE 1988 MAYORAL ELECTIONS.  THE GROUP </p><p>INTENDS TO ACT THROUGH FRONT GROUPS AND TO SEEK </p><p>ALLIANCES WITH MAINSTREAM POLITICIANS AND GROUPS SUCH AS </p><p>THE FARC\'S UNION PATRIOTICA.  THE FARC/EPL AGREEMENT </p><p>CITED IN PARAGRAPH (6) IS A PRIME MOTIVATION FOR THE </p><p>M-19\'S ACTION.  IN ADDITION, THE M-19 INTENDS TO FORGE </p><p>CLOSER LINKS WITH THE FARC.  AS WITH OTHER </p><p>INTER-GUERRILLA AGREEMEMTS, SELF-INTEREST ASSUMES A </p><p>COMMANDING POSITION; THE M-19 HOPES THAT CLOSER </p><p>RELATIONS WITH THE FARC WILL FOSTER JOINT OPERATIONS </p><p>SHOULD THE FARC-GOC TRUCE COLLAPSE.  IN OTHER </p><p>DEVELOPMENTS, THE M-19 IS CREATING NEW URBAN TERRORIST </p><p>UNITS IN COLOMBIA\'S MAJOR CITIES, AND HAS BEGUN JOINT </p><p>TRAINING WITH THE EPL TO REBUILD ITS DEPLETED STRENGTH </p><p>ALONG THE CARIBBEAN COAST. </p><p> </p><p>10. (S/NF) ELN - PULSO FIRME Y MANO TENDIDA:  IN </p><p>ADDITION, THE ELN IS NEARING COMPLETION OF A MAJOR </p><p>REORGANIZATION OF ITS BOGOTA UNITS.  FORMERLY LARGELY </p><p>AUTONOMOUS, THESE UNITS WILL NOW BE SUBJECT TO THE ELN\'S </p><p>NATIONAL DIRECTORATE.  GIVEN THE ELN\'S REPUTATION FOR </p><p>DISCIPLINE, FUTURE ELN ACTIONS IN BOGOTA MAY SEEK TO </p><p>HAVE AN IMPACT SIMILAR TO THEIR PIPELINE ATTACKS IN </p><p>ARAUCA.  REGARDING THE PIPELINE, ON JUNE 1, THE ELN </p><p>PROPOSED TO THE GOC A CESSATION OF PIPELINE ATTACKS, </p><p>PROVIDED THE GOC MET SEVERAL ELN DEMANDS REGARDING </p><p>PETROLEUM EXTRACTION AND EXPORT (SEE BOGOTA 7451). </p><p>THESE DEMANDS WERE ROUNDLY REJECTED BY RECONCILIATION </p><p>ADVISOR CARLOS OSSA ESCOBAR, WHO DECLARED THAT THE GOC </p><p>WOULD NOT NEGOTIATE ITS ENERGY POLICY "WITH AN ARMED </p><p>MINORITY INTENT ON ATTACKING THE NATIONAL PATRIMONY." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT - RESTRUCTURING FOR CONFLICT </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>11. (C/NF) MILITARY GROWTH:  GUERRILLA EFFORTS AT </p><p>RESTRUCTURING HAVE THEIR PARALLEL ON THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>SIDE.  THOUGH PRESIDENT BARCO REITERATED TO VISITING </p><p>GENERAL GALVIN (SEE BOGOTA 7463) HIS BELIEF THAT HIS </p><p>REHABILITATION PLAN WILL SAP MUCH OF THE FARC\'S </p><p>STRENGTH, HE REMAINS INTENT ON EXPANDING THE SIZE, </p><p>MOBILITY, AND PROFESSIONALISM OF THE ARMED FORCES. </p><p>BARCO BELIEVES (COMMENT: WE AGREE) THAT THE ARMED FORCES </p><p>ARE NOT NOW IN A POSITION TO TAKE ON A FULLY-ACTIVE </p><p>FARC.  HOWEVER, HIS RECENT COMMENTS SUGGEST THAT </p><p>ECONOMIC CONSTRAINTS ARE BRAKING THE PACE OF ARMY </p><p>EXPANSION.  IN A JUNE 2 SPEECH AT THE MILITARY ACADEMY, </p><p>BARCO STATED THAT HIS GOVERMMENT WOULD PROVIDE THE </p><p>"BASIC ELEMENTS" NEEDED BY THE ARMY, BUT ONLY "TO THE </p><p>MAXIMUM EXTENT POSSIBLE."  WHATEVER THE REALITY OF </p><p>BUDGET LIMITATIONS, THE COLOMBIANS HAVE DECIDED TO </p><p>PURCHASE U.S.-MADE TRANSPORT HELICOPTERS AT A COST OF </p><p>$36 MILLION, THOUGH DELIVERY OF THE FIRST UNIT WILL NOT </p><p>TAKE PLACE UNTIL LATE 1987.  IN ADDITION, THE ARMY HAS </p><p>BEEN RECRUITING SOME 2,000 DISCHARGED SOLDIERS FOR </p><p>SERVICE IN SPECIAL VOLUNTEER COMPANIES.  THESE UNITS ARE </p><p>HIGHLY RATED DUE TO THE MEN\'S PRIOR EXPERIENCE, AND HAVE </p><p>BEEN DEPLOYED IN CONTESTED AREAS SUCH AS CAQUETA </p><p>DEPARTMENT.  RECRUITMENT OF ADDITIONAL VOLUNTEER UNITS </p><p>IS EXPECTED. </p><p> </p><p>12. (U) SECURITY RESTRUCTURING:  AS A FURTHER STEP IN </p><p>COMBATTING THE THREAT POSED BY THE GUERRILLAS AND THE </p><p>EROSION OF PUBLIC ORDER, THE COUNTRY\'S PRINCIPAL </p><p>INTERNAL SECURITY ORGANS HAVE BEGUN MAJOR </p><p>REORGANIZATIONS.  THE NATIONAL POLICE ANNOUNCED JUNE 2 </p><p>THE ACTIVATION OF 30 INTELLIGENCE "BRIGADES" DESIGNED TO </p><p>DETECT URBAN ACTIVITIES BY GUERRILLA GROUPS, BE THEY </p><p>MILITARY OR POLITICAL IN NATURE.  FOR ITS PART, THE </p><p>ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY (DAS - COLOMBIAN </p><p>FBI) HAS CREATED THREE NEW COMMANDS DEDICATED TO </p><p>SECURITY, EXPLOSIVES AND COUNTER-TERRORISM, AS WELL AS </p><p>INTELLIGENCE CENTERS IN BOGOTA, CALI, MEDELLIN, AND </p><p>CUCUTA.  ACCORDING TO DAS COMMANDER GENERAL MAZA, ALL </p><p>UNITS ARE DESIGNED TO COUNTER THE WAVE OF CRIMINALITY, </p><p>TERRORISM, AND ARMED SUBVERSION CONFRONTING COLOMBIA. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PROGNOSIS </p><p>--------- </p><p>13. (C) AS INDICATED IN MISSION\'S LAST ASSESSMENT OF </p><p>COLOMBIA\'S GUERRILLA SITUATION (REFTEL), THE LEVEL OF </p><p>CONFLICT IN COLOMBIA IS EXPECTED TO GROW DURING 1987. </p><p>THE STEPS BEING TAKEN BY BOTH THE GOC AND THE VARIOUS </p><p>GUERRILLA GROUPS REFLECT THAT EXPECTATION.  THE ACTIVE </p><p>GUERRILLA GROUPS APPEAR INTENT ON STRIKING THE GOC ANEW </p><p>ONCE REDEPLOYMENT AND RETRAINING ARE ACCOMPLISHED. </p><p>HOWEVER, THE MAJOR DANGER TO COLOMBIAN INSTITUTIONS AND </p><p>U.S. INTERESTS HERE LIES IN THE ATTITUDES OF THE FARC. </p><p>EVOLUTION OF EVENTS, OF COURSE, WILL DEPEND ON HOW THE </p><p>FARC FORESEES PROSPECTS OF ITS UNION PATRIOTICA </p><p>POLITICAL FRONT IN THE MARCH 1988 POPULAR ELECTIONS FOR </p><p>MAYORS.  CURRENT PROJECTIONS SUGGEST THE UP WILL DO </p><p>FAIRLY WELL IN SOME ISOLATED RURAL AREAS, AND MAY ELECT </p><p>UP TO EIGHTY MAYORS (OUT OF OVER 1,000), ALL IN </p><p>RELATIVELY SMALL TOWNS.  BASED ON THIS EXPECTATION, MOST </p><p>OBSERVERS HERE THINK THE FARC WILL BE VERY RELUCTANT TO </p><p>FORMALLY BREAK THE TRUCE BEFORE NEXT MARCH -- ALTHOUGH </p><p>THE LEVEL OF VIOLENCE MAY RISE WITHOUT ANY DECLARATION. </p><p>BEFORE OR AFTER MARCH, THE RANGE OF POSSIBLE EVENTS IS </p><p>WIDE: THE FARC IN OPEN WARFARE, OR STILL-NOMINAL </p><p>ADHERENCE TO THE PEACE ACCORDS;  THE UP LEAVING THE </p><p>CONGRESS, OR STAYING TO USE IT AS A PLATFORM TO DENOUNCE </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT.  BUT IN OUR JUDGEMENT ALL THESE </p><p>SCENARIOS WILL HAVE ONE COMMON FACTOR:  HEIGHTENED </p><p>VIOLENCE AND INCREASED THREAT TO COLOMBIA\'S INSTITUTIONS </p><p>AND U.S. INTERESTS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GILLESPIE </p><p></p></div>
