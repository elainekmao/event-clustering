<p>UNCLAS ABUJA 001956 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>US DEPT OF COMMERCE FOR ADVOCACY CENTER </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, EINV, ECON, PREL, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: PROCTOR AND GAMBLE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) USDOC 4484 (B) ABUJA 1918 (C) USDOC 4307 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Mission appreciates Department of Commerce\'s flexibility </p><p>in redirecting the Secretary\'s letter to the Minister of </p><p>Industries.  Please note that this does not imply an overall </p><p>policy change away from commercial advocacy at the </p><p>Presidential level as Ref A suggests.  Based on recent </p><p>interaction with the President, Post feels that, in this </p><p>case, P&G\'s interests would be best served with advocacy </p><p>directed towards the Minister who will ultimately advise the </p><p>President on P&G\'s requests.  Other cases may require other </p><p>approaches, and Mission looks forward to consultations with </p><p>USDOC as each individual case moves through the advocacy </p><p>process. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  Mission does not recommend sending courtesy copies of the </p><p>letter to national legislators.  In general, the National </p><p>Assembly is not directly engaged in commercial issues. </p><p>Moreover, to our knowledge, P&G has not yet established a </p><p>relationship with key legislators in its effort to build </p><p>support for its proposals.  If such letters were delivered </p><p>without prior due diligence to assure the likelihood of a </p><p>sympathetic hearing, P&G could encounter opposition, </p><p>particularly from legislators who may support a protectionist </p><p>tariff on detergent.  On the other hand, if P&G were to </p><p>specify legislators with whom they have already established a </p><p>positive line of communication, copies of the relevant </p><p>correspondence could be shared at a time P&G deems </p><p>advantageous. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  On August 3, EconCouns discussed tariff issues, including </p><p>P&G\'s request for tariff reductions, with Manufacturer\'s </p><p>Association of Nigeria (MAN) President Charles Ugwuh and </p><p>Director General Olawale Akinpelu.  (MAN, which represents </p><p>Nigeria\'s manufacturing and export sector, in the past has </p><p>been a strong advocate of high tariff protection and, more </p><p>recently, the stiff 100 percent customs inspection practices </p><p>implemented at Nigeria\'s ports.)  According to Ugwuh, MAN, </p><p>not surprisingly, desires tariff reductions (to zero) on </p><p>capital equipment and raw materials for Nigerian manufactured </p><p>goods (P&G\'s first two requests with the GON.)  The MAN </p><p>President added that they also accepted eventual, but </p><p>gradual, tariff reductions for all consumer products -- with </p><p>commensurate improvement in both Nigerian infrastructure and </p><p>the productivity of Nigerian manufacturers.  Thus, he did not </p><p>oppose the principle of a paced annual reduction in the </p><p>tariff for detergent that would gradually force P&G\'s </p><p>domestic competitor to face stiffer market conditions. </p><p>However, the idea of an immediate reduction to the level </p><p>sought by P&G would be, Ugwah felt, politically unpalatable. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. Ugwuh and Akinpelu recommended the GON provide P&G a tax </p><p>holiday equal to the difference in the GON tariff rate and </p><p>the 25 percent tariff rate desired by P&G.  (As the tariff </p><p>rate fell, so too would the tax break.)  They also felt P&G </p><p>would have a stronger case if the company agreed to </p><p>eventually import Ariel detergent in bulk for packaging in </p><p>Nigeria, rather than importing the packaged Ariel product. </p><p>Ugwuh pointed out that Industries Minister Jamodu was, </p><p>despite his former ties to P&G\'s competitor, a "MAN man" and </p><p>understood well the benefits of competition for both </p><p>manufacturers and consumers.  A compromise between P&G and </p><p>the GON along the lines outlined above, Ugwuy believed, would </p><p>be a good basis for an agreement.  Mission has not yet </p><p>informed P&G of its conversation with MAN. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
