<p>UNCLAS AMMAN 003829 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, EFIN, IZ, JO, UNSC </p><p>SUBJECT: GOJ INQUIRES RE STATUS OF OFF CONTRACTS </p><p> </p><p>1.  (u)  This is an action request; see para 4. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (u)  On June 24, Ambassador received a letter dated June </p><p>18 from Minister of Industry and Trade Salah Eddin al Bashir </p><p>inquiring about the status of pending OFF contracts and </p><p>requesting USG assistance in resolving outstanding claims. </p><p>Text of letter follows: </p><p> </p><p>3.  (u)  Begin Text: </p><p> </p><p>(complimentary opening) </p><p> </p><p>I would like to inform you that the Ministry has recently </p><p>received a number of requests and claims from several </p><p>Jordanian companies and enterprises calling on us to </p><p>intervene in resolving an important issue that has recently </p><p>surfaced pursuant to the latest developments in our region. </p><p> </p><p>As you are aware, a number of Jordanian companies have </p><p>entered into several contracts pursuant to the Security </p><p>Council\'s oil-for-food program with the aim of assisting the </p><p>Iraqi people and providing them with much needed humanitarian </p><p>aid. </p><p> </p><p>The implementation of the said contracts has been suspended </p><p>for an undetermined period of time despite the fact that they </p><p>would be of much assistance to the Iraqi people in this </p><p>transitional phase of their lives. </p><p> </p><p>The contracts in question cover a number of vital sectors </p><p>that directly serve and support the Iraqi people, however, </p><p>the suspension of same would not only have a negative impact </p><p>on the people of Iraq but would also have serious </p><p>implications and drawbacks on a large spectrum of the </p><p>Jordanian companies, which in some cases rely totally on </p><p>trade with Iraq, taking into consideration that such </p><p>companies have already committed themselves to burdensome </p><p>financial obligations so as to fulfill the obligations set </p><p>forth therein. </p><p> </p><p>Due to the above and with the hope that the foregoing </p><p>uncertainties would be very soon clarified and resolved, I </p><p>would really appreciate your Excellency\'s intervention in </p><p>resolving this issue by contacting the competent authorities </p><p>through whatever means you deem appropriate to resume the </p><p>implementation of the terms and conditions of the contracts </p><p>that have been entered into before the fall of the Iraqi </p><p>regime. </p><p> </p><p>(complimentary closing) </p><p> </p><p>End Text. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (u)  Action request:  Post would appreciate Washington </p><p>guidance regarding the status of outstanding OFF contracts </p><p>and the mechanism for determining the disposition of these </p><p>contracts. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (u)  Baghdad minimize considered. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
