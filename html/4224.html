<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 006521 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/04/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PGOV, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: GOJ DISSOLVES SOCIETY FOR CITIZENS\' RIGHTS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. AMMAN 006154 </p><p> </p><p>     B. AMMAN 5838 </p><p>     C. AMMAN 5576 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMBASSADOR EDWARD W. GNEHM.  REASONS 1.5 (B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY.  On October 29, the Ministry of Interior </p><p>officially dissolved the Jordanian Society for Citizens\' </p><p>Rights (JSCR).  Despite previous media attention to the </p><p>plight of the JSCR, coverage of the dissolution has been </p><p>scant, coming as it did the day after the murder of Larry </p><p>Foley.  MFA officials attempted to assure PolOffs that the </p><p>move was not politically motivated and pledged to follow up. </p><p>END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>JSCR DISSOLVED </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  On October 31, PolOff and visiting NEA/ARN officer </p><p>Susan Ziadeh met with JSCR President Fawzi Samhoury. </p><p>Samhoury said that on October 29 the Governor of Amman, Abdel </p><p>Karim Malahme, called Samhoury into his office to present him </p><p>with a letter signed by the Minister of Interior, Qaftam </p><p>Majali.  The short missive (a copy of which Samhoury provided </p><p>us) said the JSCR was officially dissolved pursuant to </p><p>Article 16 of the Societies and Charitable Organizations Law </p><p>of 1966.  The letter contained no additional information </p><p>regarding the closure. </p><p> </p><p>3  (C)  Samhoury said that on October 18, the JSCR had voted, </p><p>by a large majority, to submit the financial records </p><p>requested by the GOJ in previous correspondence (reftels). </p><p>The records were sent to the Ministry of Interior on October </p><p>22.  Since that time, the GOJ has not commented on the </p><p>submission of the documents, and it was not clear to Samhoury </p><p>whether the GOJ reviewed the documents before the decision to </p><p>dissolve the JSCR was made. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Note:  according to Samhoury, Dr. Khalid Tahaineh, </p><p>the MFA\'s action officer on human rights, called him on </p><p>October 18 to say that the GOJ was upset over reports issued </p><p>by the JSCR relating to Palestinian-Jordanians losing their </p><p>passports through implementation of 1988 disengagement laws </p><p>(reftels).  End note. </p><p> </p><p>5  (C)  Samhoury was despondent over the future of the JSCR. </p><p>He said that he was reviewing the possibility of legal </p><p>action.  He said he is also in contact with outspoken former </p><p>MP Toujan Faisal, and planned to talk to the international </p><p>media.  Note:  local press coverage of the JSCR\'s demise has </p><p>been scant, despite regular coverage prior to the GOJ action </p><p>of October 29. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>MFA:  WE\'RE LOOKING INTO IT </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) On November 4, A/PolCouns and Poloff met with MFA </p><p>Legal Adviser Samer Naber and MFA Human Rights Officer </p><p>Tahaineh to obtain the GOJ\'s side of the story.  Both </p><p>confirmed that the action to close down the JSCR was based on </p><p>legal infractions, not politics.  "There is a legal basis for </p><p>the action, and there were internal disputes within the JSCR </p><p>that led to the closure," Tahaineh stated repeatedly.  Naber </p><p>noted that the MFA had requested from the Min Int an </p><p>explanation of the case and any relevant supporting </p><p>documents.  He said the MFA would follow-up with the Min Int. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  Tahaineh however, strongly implied that political </p><p>considerations were a factor, stating that "all of these </p><p>(human rights) organizations have affiliations with groups </p><p>outside Jordan, and this is what we mean when we are talking </p><p>about \'Jordan first\'."  At that point, Naber jumped in, </p><p>reiterated that the MFA had no official explanation of the </p><p>case and was waiting to hear from the Min Int, and that </p><p>"Jordan first" has nothing to do with the JSCR.  As the </p><p>meeting concluded, PolOffs noted that the closing of an </p><p>independent human rights organization had the potential to </p><p>damage Jordan\'s reputation.  Naber acknowledged this reality </p><p>and promised again to follow-up with the Min Int. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  The GOJ\'s dissolution of the JSCR is an unwelcome </p><p>and untimely development.  Samhoury has a consistent and </p><p>reliable human rights contact for several years.  At first </p><p>glance, there is reason to believe the GOJ\'s legal action is </p><p>merely a pretext to close the JSCR.  That said, the GOJ </p><p>action may well rest on defensible legal ground, and </p><p>Samhoury\'s options for legal redress have not been exhausted. </p><p> We have cautioned the GOJ, on several occasions and at </p><p>levels up to the PM, that the closing of the JSCR would be </p><p>scrutinized by the international media and human rights </p><p>activists.  We will continue to track this closely. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
