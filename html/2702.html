<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KATHMANDU 000647 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p>BEIJING PASS CHENGDU </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/31/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, CASC, ASEC, PREF, NP, CH </p><p>SUBJECT: MOUNT KAILAS TO REOPEN TO TOURISTS FROM NEPAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: A/DCM Michael S. Hoza, Reasons 1.5 (b), (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Travel agencies in Kathmandu report that as of late </p><p>March they were able to resume booking tours to western </p><p>Tibet,s Mount Kailas after the Chinese government lifted </p><p>restrictions on travel to that region.  Tours are now being </p><p>booked for dates in late April and May.  Nepal,s travel </p><p>agents say they had been unable to book tours to Kailas since </p><p>September 11. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The Lhasa-based partner of one Kathmandu agent </p><p>speculated that China would not announce the change publicly </p><p>because they did not want to draw attention to it.  Thus, he </p><p>speculated, in future they could easily restrict access </p><p>again, should they feel it necessary, without the need for </p><p>public acknowledgement. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Despite the deteriorating security situation in Nepal, </p><p>demand for package tours to Kailas from Nepal remains fairly </p><p>high.  However, due to conditions inside Nepal, Kathmandu </p><p>tour operators have begun - literally speaking - to take a </p><p>different approach to Kailas.  Previously, Kailas-bound </p><p>tourists flew to western Nepal and hiked over the Himalayas </p><p>to their destination.  Nowadays tours take the highway north </p><p>to Tibet via Kodari, turn left, and drive along the Chinese </p><p>road to the base of the sacred mountain. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
