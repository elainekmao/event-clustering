(C)  AMBASSADOR\'S SCHEDULED SEPTEMBER 17 MEETING TO </p><p>DISCUSS CHINA (REF A) WITH VICE FOREIGN MINISTER LE VAN </p><p>BANG (FORMERLY AMBASSADOR TO U.S., AND NOW RESPONSIBLE </p><p>FOR NORTHEAST ASIA) WAS UNAVOIDABLY DIVERTED INTO A </p><p>DISCUSSION OF PRESSING BILATERAL ISSUES (REFS C-D). </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  BANG CAME PREPARED WITH SOME THOUGHTS ON THE </p><p>US-VIETNAM BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP.  READING FROM THREE </p><p>PAGES OF PRINTED NOTES, HE URGED THAT THE U.S. DO MORE </p><p>TO "BUILD TRUST," OFFERING THE FOLLOWING SUGGESTIONS: </p><p>--  MORE HIGH LEVEL MEETINGS, HOWEVER SHORT, SUCH AS </p><p>THE FOREIGN MINISTER\'S RECENT CALL ON DEPUTY SECRETARY </p><p>ARMITAGE, AND THE POSSIBILITY OF AN UPCOMING TALK (EVEN </p><p>TEN MINUTES) BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT AND PRIME MINISTER </p><p>PHAN VAN KHAI AT APEC; </p><p>--  CONTINUE DIALOGUES ON HUMAN RIGHTS AND POLITICAL </p><p>ISSUES, AREAS OF ONGOING DISAGREEMENTS; </p><p>--  ESTABLISH A DISPUTE SETTLEMENT BODY IN THE CONTEXT </p><p>OF THE BILATERAL TRADE AGREEMENT (AMBASSADOR NOTED THAT </p><p>THE EXISTING BTA-RELATED MECHANISM ALREADY PROVIDES A </p><p>GOOD FORUM FOR THIS); </p><p>--  AVOID LETTING CONTROVERSIAL ISSUES SUCH AS ETHNIC </p><p>MINORITIES, HUMAN RIGHTS, AND RELIGIOUS FREEDOM BE </p><p>"PROMINENT" IN BILATERAL RELATIONS, BUT INSTEAD SEEK </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02272  01 OF 02  181057Z </p><p>WAYS TO SOLVE DISAGREEMENTS "CONSTRUCTIVELY, NOT AT THE </p><p>EXPENSE OF THE RELATIONSHIP." </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  VFM BANG EMPHASIZED THAT "FRANKLY, YOU MUST </p><p>HAVE A WAY TO WIN OVER VIETNAM" IN A MANNER THAT WOULD </p><p>BE "CONDUCIVE TO US POLICY IN SOUTHEAST ASIA."  (HE </p><p>USED THE SAME PHRASEOLOGY IN A CONVERSATION WITH THE </p><p>DCM AT POST\'S 9/11 CEREMONY, WHERE HE ALSO SAID THAT </p><p>VIETNAM WANTS TO BE "WITH" THE U.S.)  HE WELCOMED US </p><p>INTEREST IN A "STRATEGIC RELATIONSHIP" BETWEEN THE U.S. </p><p>AND VIETNAM, AND REITERATED A NEED TO SOLVE SENSITIVE </p><p>ISSUES "QUIETLY."  HE OFFERED THANKS FOR US AID </p><p>PROGRAMS, ESPECIALLY RELATED TO LEGAL AND </p><p>ADMINISTRATIVE REFORM, AND EXPRESSED INTEREST IN </p><p>VIETNAM\'S INCLUSION IN THE MILLENIUM CHALLENGE FUND. </p><p>AMBASSADOR NOTED OTHER US HUMANITARIAN AID PROGRAMS AS </p><p>WELL, AND DESCRIBED US FRUSTRATION AT DIFFICULTIES IN </p><p>INCREASING AID IN THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS.  VFM BANG </p><p>RETORTED THAT "SOMETIMES NOT TO HELP IS TO HELP." </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  VFM BANG DESCRIBED BURGEONING RELATIONS </p><p>ELSEWHERE, POINTING TO COMMUNIST PARTY GENERAL </p><p>SECRETARY NONG DUC MANH\'S OCTOBER TRIP TO JAPAN, A </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>"GOOD VISIT" BY DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER NGUYEN TAN DUNG </p><p>TO SOUTH KOREA RECENTLY, "GOOD RELATIONS" WITH TAIWAN </p><p>(NOW INCLUDING "65,000 SONS-IN-LAW"), "FRIENDLY" </p><p>RELATIONS WITH CHINA, AND EXPANDED TIES WITHIN ASEAN </p><p>AND IN ASEM.  HE STRESSED THAT VIETNAM ALSO "VERY MUCH </p><p>WANTS TO IMPROVE RELATIONS" WITH THE U.S. TO A "HIGHER </p><p>LEVEL," AND ASKED FOR AMBASSADOR\'S PERSONAL HELP IN </p><p>ACHIEVING THIS.  HE URGED THAT VIETNAM AND THE U.S. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02272  01 OF 02  181057Z </p><p>WORK TOGETHER TOWARD IMPROVING THE STABILITY OF THE </p><p>WHOLE REGION, EVEN FARTHER AFIELD SUCH AS THE KOREAN </p><p>PENINSULA AND CHINA. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C)  AMBASSADOR EXPRESSED AGREEMENT WITH THIS GOAL, </p><p>NOTING EFFORTS TO ARRANGE HIGH LEVEL TRIPS IN BOTH </p><p>DIRECTIONS, AND TO UTILIZE THESE MEETINGS TO RAISE THE </p><p>LEVEL OF DISCUSSION.  VFM BANG NOTED THAT, WHILE THE </p><p>STATE DEPARTMENT AND MFA WERE OF SIMILAR MINDS ON THIS </p><p>GOAL, IT WAS IMPORTANT TO CONVINCE OTHER DEPARTMENTS -- </p><p>NOTABLY THE PENTAGON AND THE MINISTRY OF NATIONAL </p><p>DEFENSE (MND) -- OF THE DESIRABILITY OF SUCH TIES.  HE </p><p>SUGGESTED THAT THE "ENVIRONMENT WAS NOT CONDUCIVE" FOR </p><p>FALL 2002 VISIT TO THE U.S. BY DEFENSE MINISTER TRA, </p><p>URGING THE U.S. INSTEAD TO "BUILD UP" MILITARY-TO- </p><p>MILITARY TIES FIRST.  AMBASSADOR RECOUNTED EXISTING </p><p>FORMS OF MILITARY COOPERATION SUCH AS IN MEDICAL </p><p>RESEARCH, AS WELL AS ONGOING TALKS ON FUTURE SHIP </p><p>VISITS.  (NOTE:  THE LAST CONVERSATION BETWEEN DATT AND </p><p>MND REGARDING MINISTER TRA\'S TRIP INDICATED THAT HE WAS </p><p>STILL HOPING TO TRAVEL TO THE U.S. IN THE LATE </p><p>NOVEMBER/EARLY DECEMBER TIMEFRAME.  END NOTE) </p><p> </p><p>7.

HE IS LIKELY DISTURBED AT THE </p><p>POSSIBILITY THAT US-VIETNAM TIES ARE FAILING TO KEEP </p><p>PACE WITH THE SOMETIMES OVERWHELMING DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS </p><p>OF NORTHEAST ASIAN STATES, AS WELL AS THE LARGER </p><p>ECONOMIC AND ASSISTANCE ROLES JAPAN, SOUTH KOREA, AND </p><p>TAIWAN PLAY HERE.  WE AGREE WITH HIS ASSESSMENT THAT IT </p><p>IS IMPORTANT FOR THE USG NOT ONLY TO DO MORE </p><p>BILATERALLY, BUT ALSO TO BE SEEN AS DOING MORE HERE. </p><p>THIS IS A TOUGH TASK IN A COUNTRY WHERE THE MEDIA IS SO </p><p>CONTROLLED, OFTEN INDEED BY ELEMENTS OF THE CPV AND GVN </p><p>NOT ESPECIALLY INCLINED TO BE FAVORABLE TOWARD THE US. </p><p>DAS DALEY\'S VISIT, THE PROBABLE OCTOBER POLITICAL </p><p>DIALOGUE, HOPEFULLY A PRESIDENTIAL PHOTO OP AT APEC </p><p>WITH THE PM, AND THE POSSIBLE DECEMBER VISIT HERE BY </p><p>THE MARINE CORPS COMMANDANT OFFER SOME SHORT-TERM </p><p>BOOSTS TO THE VISIBILITY OF OUR BILATERAL TIES.  BUT, </p><p>AS BANG ACKNOWLEDGED, PROGRESS WILL CONTINUE TO BE </p><p>SLOWED BY LEADERSHIP ELEMENTS WHO ARE LESS ENTHUSIASTIC </p><p>ABOUT US-VIETNAM TIES THAN THE FOREIGN MINISTRY.  SOME </p><p>OF THESE PEOPLE -- IN THE MILITARY, PUBLIC SECURITY, </p><p>AND PROPAGANDA FIELDS, FOR EXAMPLE -- MAY ALSO BE MORE </p><p>RECEPTIVE TO BEIJING THAN BANG (REF A). </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
