<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ISTANBUL 000049 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, EB/IFD/OMA AND EUR/SE </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA - MILLS AND LEICHTER </p><p>STATE PASS USTR - NOVELLI AND BIRDSEY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/09/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, ECON, EFIN, ETRD, TU, Istanbul </p><p>SUBJECT: ISTANBUL\'S TAKE ON AK ECONOMICS: ALL ISN\'T LOST </p><p>BUT AK ISN\'T HELPING </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. (A) ANKARA 160 </p><p>     B. (B) ANKARA 193 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Consul General David Arnett.  Reasons: 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: Istanbul contacts in the financial and real </p><p>sectors agree that in its first month and a half Turkey\'s Ak </p><p>government "hasn\'t gotten it" and has done a poor job on </p><p>economic policy, thereby dissipating much of the goodwill </p><p>generated by initial perceptions that a single-party </p><p>government would break the deadlock that has constrained </p><p>Turkish governments over the past decade.  Explanations range </p><p>from a combination of inexperience, lack of coordination, and </p><p>inconsistency, to a perception that far from being a unified </p><p>party, Ak is riven into warring factions with the "populist </p><p>wing," at least to date, coming out on top.  Many believe </p><p>that all is not lost, however.  While pessimists believe that </p><p>AK will not get it under any circumstances, a not </p><p>insignificant group believes that with the "road map staring </p><p>it in the face," economic forces will ultimately compel AK to </p><p>stick with the program.  The failure of Tuesday\'s treasury </p><p>auction (ref a) is seen by many as a salutory first warning </p><p>by the markets, while PM Gul\'s subsequent budget </p><p>pronouncements (ref b) have been taken as a sign that at </p><p>least parts of the government are getting the message. </p><p>Concern is also widespread about the economic impact on </p><p>Turkey of an Iraq operation, though most agree that recent </p><p>estimates are highly exaggerated (one contact quipped that </p><p>they led him to conclude the "U.S. is planning to attack </p><p>Turkey rather than Iraq").  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Evaporating Euphoria: In a round of calls on leading </p><p>bank, real sector, and market actors on Wednesday, January 8, </p><p>visiting Ankara Econ Counselor and Istanbul Pol/Econ Chief </p><p>heard a decidedly downbeat assessment of Ak\'s performance to </p><p>date.  The meetings followed closely on Tuesday\'s </p><p>unsuccessful Treasury Auction and overlapped with PM Gul\'s </p><p>afternoon budget statement.  Akbank CEO Zafer Kurtul noted </p><p>that positive market sentiment has rapidly dissipated in the </p><p>face of Ak\'s expansive spending plans and failure to identify </p><p>savings to pay for them.  Even Ak allies from within MUSIAD </p><p>(the "Islamic" businessmen\'s association) conceded that </p><p>Erdogan\'s "populist" policies have raised issues for the </p><p>market, while longtime Ak skeptics at Bender Securities </p><p>argued that the only possible "method to the madness" of </p><p>recent government policies was expectation that at the end of </p><p>the day neither the U.S. nor the IMF would allow Turkey to </p><p>fail.  Optimism lingers in some camps, however.  ING Baring\'s </p><p>Managing Director John McCarthy, a seasoned Turkey watcher, </p><p>conceded that AK\'s "honeymoon is over," but argued that </p><p>despite its populist tendencies, Ak is "smart enough to see </p><p>the roadmap and won\'t tinker too much." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) A Shot across the Bows: All pointed to the failure of </p><p>the January 7 treasury auction to raise sufficient cash for </p><p>the Treasury to meet its redemption requirements as an </p><p>important warning to the government, as even the local </p><p>"primary dealers" that have supported the market up to now </p><p>failed to step up to the plate.  PM Gul\'s announcement of tax </p><p>increases and spending cuts late on January 8 (ref b) was </p><p>taken as evidence that the message had registered, but </p><p>Bender\'s initial reading was that even taken at face value </p><p>the measures will be insufficient to achieve a 6.5 percent </p><p>primary surplus goal that Gul reiterated.  Bender Chief </p><p>Economist Emin Ozturk noted too that covering the shortfall </p><p>forced the Treasury to expend a significant portion of its </p><p>foreign exchange account at the Central Bank.  A similar </p><p>shortfall in the next auction on January 21, he warned, will </p><p>deplete the account, leaving no "cushion for the future." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Embattled Reformers?: The general consensus among </p><p>those we canvassed was that economic understanding in AK is </p><p>thin, limited mainly to Prime Minister Gul and State Minister </p><p>Babacan and their entourages.  Deputy Prime Minister Sener </p><p>had few admirers among those we talked to, while there was </p><p>agreement that Erdogan too has "not played a constructive </p><p>role" on economic policy.  Given perceived tensions between </p><p>Gul and Erdogan, and doubts about how much weight Babacan </p><p>carries within the government, there was concern about just </p><p>how effective the reformist bloc could be.  Not all judge the </p><p>situation hopeless, however.  McCarthy noted that a recent </p><p>TUSIAD meeting in Ankara concluded that the organization </p><p>could work with AK, but would need to "support it to the </p><p>extent we can" to make up for its lack of depth and </p><p>credentials. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Dangerous Tendencies: Observers also expressed concern </p><p>that despite public pledges to make a new start, AK may </p><p>revert to familiar patterns of nepotism and corruption. </p><p>Bender pointed to anecdotal word that some party </p><p>functionaries are resigning to create construction companies, </p><p>presumably to benefit from public tenders, while indications </p><p>that Interior Minister Aksu\'s brothers may be appointed to </p><p>head BOTAS and Turkseker also raised concerns.  Bender also </p><p>pointed to mutual suspicions between AK and ranking </p><p>bureaucrats and pressure from the AK caucus to put "loyal </p><p>people" in place as potential destabilizing factors. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Growth?: Less consensus existed on the question of </p><p>where Turkey\'s economy is now.  While the Bank of New York </p><p>said it has seen no movement, noting that its loan exposure </p><p>has fallen by 2/3 to just over 300 million USD, Yapi Kredi </p><p>Senior Economist Hasan Ersel said his bank has seen some </p><p>progress in the real economy, though he only expects 4 </p><p>percent growth this year.  (Ersel conceded that absent a </p><p>settlement between the Cukorova Group and BRSA, however, his </p><p>own institution\'s embattled predicament is not sustainable </p><p>past mid-year.)  Some other companies are also thriving. </p><p>Lezzo Industries Chairman Erol Yarar (founding Chairman of </p><p>Musiad) noted that his group expects 9 percent growth in </p><p>sales this year and plans significant new investments, while </p><p>AKBank CEO Kurtul noted that the bank is doing well and is </p><p>working to increase market share in key product lines.  Both </p><p>reminded us, however, that beyond the current range of macro </p><p>issues facing AK, there are a whole range of structural </p><p>impediments in the Turkish economy that hinder business and </p><p>discourage investment.  These, they argued, will have to be </p><p>addressed before Turkey is able to achieve truly sustainable </p><p>and balanced growth. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Iraq: Concern about Iraq\'s impact on Turkey\'s own </p><p>economy was more muted than recent alarmist press statements </p><p>led us to expect.   Noting that damage estimates are clearly </p><p>exaggerated, Ersel quipped that they prompted him to wonder </p><p>whether the U.S. was shifting its sights and planning to </p><p>attack Turkey rather than Iraq.  Yarar too downplayed the </p><p>issue, judging that "the thought is worse than the reality." </p><p>There was concern, however, particularly from market players </p><p>that the perception that the U.S. and IMF would not permit </p><p>Turkey to fail is creating a "moral hazard" and contributing </p><p>to slippage on economic reform and fiscal discipline. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Comment: Gul\'s statement came late in our day of </p><p>meetings and was only addressed by Bender analysts, who </p><p>judged it positive but insufficient.  That view has largely </p><p>been echoed over the last two days by other market analysts. </p><p>But whatever the doubts about the specific figures (and there </p><p>are many), there is at least relief that AK appears to have </p><p>gotten the market\'s message at some level.  Whether the </p><p>reform contingent is capable of building on that start </p><p>remains to be seen.  Many in the markets have their doubts. </p><p>End comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ARNETT </p><p></p></div>
