<p>S E C R E T AMMAN 004533 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/13/2012 </p><p>TAGS: MOPS, ETTC, EPET, PREL, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDAN: NO INCREASE IN INSURANCE OR SHIPPING </p><p>CHARGES SINCE MARLO ADVISORY </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. AMMAN 4506 </p><p> </p><p>     B. AMMAN 3893 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM Gregory L. Berry.  Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d) </p><p> </p><p>1. (c)  Summary.  According to the head of the Jordanian </p><p>Shipping Agents Association, the July issuance of a "special </p><p>advisory" by the Maritime Liaison Office (MARLO) in Bahrain </p><p>has not resulted in an increase in either insurance or </p><p>freight charges for Aqaba shipping.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (c)  Senior Jordanian officials, including in recent </p><p>meetings in Washington, have alleged that the July 8 special </p><p>advisory that the MIF was "planning to resume" maritime </p><p>interception operations in the Gulf of Aqaba had led to an </p><p>increase in insurance and/or freight charges for cargo </p><p>shipped via the port of Aqaba.  The Prime Minister told the </p><p>Ambassador August 5 that it was now cheaper to deliver goods </p><p>to Syrian ports and transport overland to Jordan than to ship </p><p>directly to Aqaba. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (c)  However, Captain Mohammed Dalabieh (please protect) </p><p>the director of the Jordanian Shipping Agents Association and </p><p>former Aqaba Port Director, told econ chief August 11 that </p><p>neither set of costs had been affected by the MARLO advisory. </p><p> Dalabieh said that approximately four months ago he and the </p><p>Jordanian embassy in London convinced Lloyds and other </p><p>insurance companies to discontinue "war risk" insurance </p><p>surcharges that had been imposed on ships calling at Aqaba </p><p>since military activity began in Afghanistan in October 2001. </p><p> Shipping lines had been passing these surcharges (which, </p><p>Dalabieh said averaged about usd 4.50 per ton) on to </p><p>shippers.  When the surcharges were ended, the lines only cut </p><p>their rates by about usd 2.00 to 2.50 per ton.  Nevertheless, </p><p>Dalabieh did not believe that the higher costs had affected </p><p>port usage. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (c)  Dalabieh said he understood that a resumption of MIF </p><p>inspections was not likely.  He was more concerned about the </p><p>potential impact on Aqaba port activity of possible military </p><p>action against Iraq.  He said he expected that renewed war </p><p>risk surcharges would result in a cut of about 50 percent in </p><p>ships visiting Aqaba, cutting vital foreign currency earning </p><p>exports of phosphates and potash by at least that much. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (S)  Comment: We are continuing to keep a close eye on </p><p>port traffic to ensure that there are no more surreptitious </p><p>attempts to move illicit shipments out of Aqaba. </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
