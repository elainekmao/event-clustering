<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 000975 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR S/CT KATY GORE AND DS/IP/AF </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/02/13 </p><p>TAGS: PTER, ASEC, EAIR, PGOV, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: NO SIGN OF MISSING 727 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 143140 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY POL/C BRIAN BROWNE.  REASONS: 1.5 (B, D & G). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (S/NF) SUMMARY: In response to Reftel, Mission </p><p>officers visited four Nigerian airports June 1 and did </p><p>not see the missing 727 aircraft.  It is unlikely the </p><p>aircraft could have landed in Nigeria without drawing </p><p>considerable GON attention. Since the disappearance of </p><p>the aircraft, DATT has remained in contact with the </p><p>Nigerian Defense Intelligence Agency (NDIA) and senior </p><p>Nigerian officials.  Nigeria-based IRS Airlines </p><p>Chairman Rabiu Isyaku Rabiu, informed Ambassador Jeter </p><p>that Aerospace Sales and Leasing of Jacksonville, FL, </p><p>owned the missing aircraft, tail number N844AA and </p><p>that the principal of Aerospace was Maury Joseph. </p><p>Rabiu told the Ambassador that Joseph was probably in </p><p>South Africa, and his telephone number was 27-73-315- </p><p>0565. Rabiu, whose IRS Airlines\' colors are similar to </p><p>the silver/white fuselage and blue and white stripe of </p><p>the aircraft, offered to show Post any documents </p><p>regarding prior ownership of aircraft in the IRS </p><p>fleet.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MISSION VISITS FOUR AIRPORTS </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The Mission sent officers to Abuja, Kaduna, </p><p>Kano and Lagos airports Sunday June 1. (Domestic </p><p>Airlines do not fly before 8 AM on Sundays).  Officers </p><p>did not see an airplane fitting the description of the </p><p>missing 727, but collected the following tail numbers </p><p>of all 727 aircraft on the ground at that time: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Abuja Airport: One 727 at the domestic terminal, </p><p>owned by Nigerian-based Chanchangi Airlines, tail </p><p>number 5NB-CF.  No 727 aircraft at the international </p><p>terminal. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Kaduna Airport: No 727 aircraft on tarmac. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Kano Airport: One 727 located on the shared </p><p>international and domestic tarmac, owned by Nigerian- </p><p>based Freedom Air, tail number 5N-BCY.  (NOTE:  A </p><p>member of Nigeria\'s State Security Service (SSS) </p><p>informed Emboff that the aircraft had not flown in </p><p>over a year.  END NOTE). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Lagos International and Domestic Airports: One 727 </p><p>aircraft located at the domestic terminal, owned by </p><p>IRS Airlines, tail number 5N-RIR .  No 727 aircraft at </p><p>the international terminal. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NIGERIA\'S CLOSE COOPERATION </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (S/NF) On May 27, the DATT contacted the Nigerian </p><p>Defense Intelligence Agency (NDIA) about the missing </p><p>aircraft and met with the Chief of Defense </p><p>Intelligence.  The DATT contacted the Directors of </p><p>Operations and Foreign Liaison, NDIA, and the Military </p><p>Commander of Lagos International Airport when </p><p>subsequent reports indicated the aircraft might be in </p><p>Lagos or Kano.  All his contacts had no information </p><p>that the airplane had landed in Nigeria or entered its </p><p>airspace. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>IRS AIRLINES CHAIRMAN WILLING TO ASSIST </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (S/NF) The Ambassador spoke with Rabiu Isyaku </p><p>Rabiu, Chairman of Nigerian-based IRS Airlines, May </p><p>31.  Rabiu was aware of plane and mentioned key names. </p><p>Rabiu said that Aerospace Sales and Leasing of </p><p>Jacksonville, FL, owned the airplane.  Rabiu </p><p>identified Maury Joseph as the principal owner of </p><p>Aerospace.  Joseph was probably in South Africa and </p><p>his telephone number was 27-73-315-0565, Rabiu told </p><p>the Ambassador.  AN IRS 727, tail number 5N-AKR, was </p><p>currently in Johannesburg for maintenance, Rabiu </p><p>stated. Rabiu recalled that Aerospace had previously </p><p>tried to sell IRS an aircraft with tail number N880AA </p><p>but that IRS did not purchase the airplane because it </p><p>was too old. To disprove his connection with the </p><p>airplane, Rabiu offered to show us any documentation </p><p>regarding the prior ownership of aircraft in the IRS </p><p>fleet. </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (S/NF) Post does not think that the missing 727 </p><p>aircraft could have entered Nigerian airspace and </p><p>landed at one of four major airports, Port Harcourt </p><p>International Airport or smaller domestic airports </p><p>without attracting immediate GON attention.  At each </p><p>of the visited airports, GON officials (SSS, Ministry </p><p>of Aviation, FAAN and military officers) were aware of </p><p>the missing airplane; the GON had earlier in the week </p><p>alerted airport and security officials, to immediately </p><p>impound the airplane and arrest its crew if it landed </p><p>at any Nigerian Airport. END COMMENT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
