<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 HARARE 002368 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR CNEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/29/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MANIPULATION OF FOOD DELIVERIES: UNSC </p><p>CONSIDERATION? </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: political section chief Matt Harrington.  Reasons: 1.5 ( </p><p>B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary:  The MDC\'s Economic Affairs Secretary -- </p><p>Eddie Cross -- expressed concern about the Government of </p><p>Zimbabwe\'s manipulation of food deliveries and pressed for UN </p><p>Security Council action on this as a major human rights </p><p>issue.  The Ambassador suggested that the food shortage and </p><p>GOZ\'s politicization of food assistance might be an </p><p>appropriate matter for UNSC consideration but thought that </p><p>linking this to human rights might be a more difficult </p><p>proposition.  Cross told us that a team of South Africans was </p><p>in town exploring options for resolution of the political </p><p>crisis, and South Africa\'s High Commissioner subsequently </p><p>confirmed this account.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Manipulation of food </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) In an October 25 meeting with the Ambassador, Eddie </p><p>Cross, Economic Affairs Secretary for the Movement for </p><p>Democratic Change (MDC), expressed serious concern about </p><p>Zimbabwe\'s dire food shortage and the Government of </p><p>Zimbabwe\'s manipulation of it.  He claimed that the GOZ has </p><p>battened down the commercial supply of food by instituting a </p><p>national system of roadblocks to inhibit movement of </p><p>foodstuffs.  Food cannot be transported from one place to </p><p>another, even on a small scale.  For instance, a bag of flour </p><p>being taken by a friend of his to relatives in rural areas </p><p>was confiscated by police at a roadblock, and these sorts of </p><p>incidents happen regularly around the country.  In addition, </p><p>during the recent rural council elections and parliamentary </p><p>by-election in Insiza, the ruling party campaigned with bags </p><p>of maize, while stating explicitly that those districts that </p><p>voted for the MDC would not be fed.  The Government sells the </p><p>food it procures at a limited number of distribution centers </p><p>-- manned by Border Gezi militia members -- and buyers must </p><p>present a ZANU-PF card and proof of residence.  Those unable </p><p>to produce a ZANU-PF card or who live in a district which </p><p>voted for the MDC are not permitted to buy food, Cross </p><p>claimed.  Governor Cephas Msipa of Midlands Province does not </p><p>permit the politicization of aid in his province, but all of </p><p>his gubernatorial colleagues do, he continued. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Cross declared that the denial of food to hungry </p><p>people because of their political affiliation is a serious </p><p>abuse of human rights and humanitarian principles.  He said </p><p>MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai was considering pressing the UN </p><p>Security Council to consider formally the Government\'s </p><p>manipulation of food as a serious violation of human rights. </p><p>Cross suggested that perhaps Kofi Annan could send an </p><p>investigative team with the mandate to gather evidence and </p><p>report back to the Security Council. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) The Ambassador noted that there are numerous </p><p>confirmed reports of Government-sourced food being used to </p><p>buttress ZANU-PF\'s political fortunes.  Deliveries of donor </p><p>food assistance, on the other hand, seem to be working well, </p><p>for the most part.  He said he had attended many food </p><p>distribution events conducted by WFP\'s implementing partners, </p><p>and he was convinced that beneficiaries are identified in a </p><p>fair, transparent manner.   Prior to the WFP suspension of </p><p>food deliveries in Insiza, the only serious problem with </p><p>international food assistance occurred in the northwestern </p><p>town of Binga, where local authorities have blocked </p><p>deliveries by NGOs they accused of favoring the MDC.  The </p><p>Ambassador said we would investigate any allegations of </p><p>politicization of donor food assistance, and he encouraged </p><p>the MDC also to share specific concerns with WFP and the </p><p>relevant NGO.  The Ambassador told Cross that an independent </p><p>monitoring mechanism was expected to be in place within two </p><p>weeks.  Cross replied that the MDC is in regular contact with </p><p>the UN\'s humanitarian coordinator -- and UNDP Resrep -- in </p><p>Zimbabwe, Victor Angelo. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Regarding UN involvement, the Ambassador said he was </p><p>not sure that another mission to Zimbabwe is the answer. </p><p>Addressing the food shortage would be an appropriate matter </p><p>for the UN, including lack of GOZ cooperation with </p><p>international donors, but tying this to human rights would be </p><p>a more difficult proposition.  Perhaps the UN Security </p><p>Council could ask UN agencies to report on the food situation </p><p>and invite outside witnesses, the Ambassador suggested. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  In a separate conversation with political section </p><p>chief, MDC MP David Coltart expressed anger at WFP\'s </p><p>suspension of food deliveries in Insiza two weeks prior to </p><p>the October 26-27 parliamentary by-election, after three </p><p>metric tons were stolen by ZANU-PF supporters and distributed </p><p>to beneficiaries of their choosing.  Coltart said the move </p><p>ensured that the only food available in the constituency for </p><p>two weeks was that provided by the ruling party, which </p><p>distributed food at all its campaign rallies.  He said WFP </p><p>should have, instead, flooded the area with food and been </p><p>much more public in its criticism of the Government for </p><p>failing to arrest those responsible.  Coltart was worried </p><p>that failure to resume deliveries in Binga -- which have been </p><p>stopped since the MDC swept most seats in the recent rural </p><p>council elections in late September -- while restarting them </p><p>in Insiza, shortly after ZANU-PF\'s election victory there, </p><p>will send the unmistakeable message to rural populations that </p><p>voting for the ruling party is the only way of acquiring </p><p>food.  (Comment:  We asked Coltart if he really would have </p><p>been happy to have the WFP continue to deliver food in Insiza </p><p>when it could not assure it would not be seized.   Coltart is </p><p>rightly angry at ZANU-PF\'s behavior in Insiza, but his </p><p>criticism of WFP is misplaced since flooding Insiza with food </p><p>was hardly an option for WFP when its food had been seized. </p><p>His points about more public WFP criticism of ZANU-PF\'s food </p><p>seizure and the importance of resuming food distribution in </p><p>Binga have more merit.  End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p>South Africans in Town </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  Eddie Cross expressed concern that political </p><p>tensions would soon get out of hand and that the MDC would be </p><p>unable to control them.  He said the South African Government </p><p>(SAG) at that moment had "a team" in town trying to broker a </p><p>political solution.  He said the MDC had rejected the team\'s </p><p>proposal that the party withdraw its legal challenge of the </p><p>presidential election results.  Cross claimed that the GOZ </p><p>had sought the services of an Indian attorney to represent it </p><p>in this case but that he had refused, saying it was </p><p>unwinnable.   Cross said the MDC believed a prerequisite to </p><p>any political transition must be Mugabe\'s retirement.  The </p><p>party, he said, has told the SAG that, once Mugabe withdraws </p><p>from active politics, it would agree to a transition period, </p><p>supervised by SADC, that leads to a new election held under </p><p>international supervision.  The Ambassador replied that that </p><p>approach sounded reasonable, but he cautioned that the ruling </p><p>party only appears interested in a political solution that </p><p>guarantees a ZANU-PF government in perpetuity. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Cross\'s comment on a South African team took us by </p><p>surprise, so we followed up with a couple of key </p><p>interlocutors to learn more.  Gandi Mudzingwa, Tsvangirai\'s </p><p>special advisor, confirmed the presence of South African </p><p>officials, but he said they were intelligence officers from </p><p>President Mbeki\'s office here to test the waters for a </p><p>possible Mbeki visit.  They were not selling particular </p><p>proposals, but were clearly probing for possible solutions to </p><p>Zimbabwe\'s political crisis.   Mudzingwa claimed they had </p><p>arranged their own travel here, outside the auspices of the </p><p>South African High Commission, and did not meet with GOZ </p><p>representatives.  In a conversation with the Ambassador, </p><p>South Africa\'s High Commissioner, Jeremiah Ndou, acknowledged </p><p>the presence of the team.  He did not offer details on their </p><p>identities or home agency -- and we did not press him on this </p><p>-- but said they were in Harare "to see what\'s possible."  In </p><p>any case, it appears that the South Africans are considering </p><p>ramping up their involvement in the search for a lasting </p><p>resolution of the political crisis here.  We cannot confirm </p><p>whether the low-profile team members were indeed intelligence </p><p>officers from Mbeki\'s office, but Ndou\'s reticence to </p><p>elaborate on their efforts suggests that they could be.  We </p><p>would welcome Embassy Pretoria\'s perspective on this </p><p>interesting development. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) Cross is right that ZANU-PF has manipulated the food </p><p>assistance it provides in a variety of ways to buttress its </p><p>support and punish the residents of areas where the MDC is </p><p>strong.  The delivery of international food assistance is </p><p>working very smoothly, with the two major exceptions of Binga </p><p>and Insiza.  We believe the question of diverting food from </p><p>opposition supporters -- when more than half of Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>population is facing famine -- is an appropriate issue for </p><p>discussion by the UN Security Council, but would defer to </p><p>others on whether linking this matter to human rights is the </p><p>most effective diplomatic approach. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
