<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L BAGHDAD 00224 </p><p> </p><p>PASS TO CONGEN DUBAI </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, SOCI, IR, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT:  THE RELIGIOUS SUCCESSION IN IRAN </p><p> </p><p>REF:  ABU DHABI 137 </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL -  ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  AN ARAB BUSINESSMAN IN REFTEL SAID THAT GRAND </p><p>AYATOLLAH KHOI\'S RELATIVES IN IRAN ALLEGE THAT </p><p>SEVENTY PERCENT OF IRANIAN SHI\'A, AND ALMOST ALL </p><p>IRAQI SHI\'A, FOLLOW KHOI\'S INTERPRETATION OF ISLAM. </p><p>WE HAVE RECEIVED MUCH THE SAME VERSION FROM ONE OF </p><p>KHOI\'S SONS HERE.  WE ALSO RECALL EARLIER CONGEN </p><p>DHAHRAN REPORTING THAT A SIMILAR PERCENTAGE OF SAUDI </p><p>SHI\'A ADHERE TO HIM. </p><p> </p><p>3.  WE TOO WOULD LIKE TO HAVE RELIABLE CONFIRMATION </p><p>OF KHOI\'S APPEAL IN IRAN.  WE ARE NOT SO SURE ABOUT </p><p>CONGEN DUBAI\'S ASSESSMENT THAT KHOI\'S POSITION MAY </p><p>HAVE BEEN ERODED IN IRAN.  AFTER ALL, KHOMEINI WAS </p><p>IN NAJAF FOR FOURTEEN YEARS, WHICH DID NOTHING TO </p><p>ERODE HIS STANDING IN IRAN.  KHOI HAS BEEN IN NAJAF </p><p>FOR MOST OF THIS CENTURY, FOLLOWING A TRADITION OF </p><p>IRANIAN AYATOLLAHS THAT GOES BACK TO 1722.  WE DOUBT, </p><p>AS SUGGESTED BY REFTEL\'S SOURCE,THAT KHOI HAS COME </p><p>TO BAGHDAD OR THAT HE IS INVOLVED IN ANY WAY IN ANTI- </p><p>KHOMEINI BROADCASTS.  ALTHOUGH HE IS CERTAINLY NO </p><p>FRIEND OF KHOMEINI, WHOM HE CONSIDERS AN UPSTART </p><p>WITH DUBIOUS RELIGIOUS CREDENTIALS, HE HAS STEAD- </p><p>FASTLY REFUSED TO TAKE SIDES PUBLICLY ON THE WAR. </p><p> </p><p>4.  WHETHER KHOI IS ACTUALLY A THREAT TO MONTAZERI </p><p>OR ANY OTHER POTENTIAL SUCCESSOR TO KHOMEINI IS </p><p>ANOTHER MATTER, SINCE KHOI, WHO IS NOW AGED AND </p><p>INFIRM, IS NO MORE POLITICALLY ORIENTED, WE UNDER- </p><p>STAND, THAN GOLPAYEGANI.  KHOI HAS ALWAYS BEEN A </p><p>STRONG PROPONENT OF THE QUIETIST SCHOOL OF AYATOL- </p><p>LAHS WHO INSIST THAT CLERICS SHOULD STAY OUT OF </p><p>GOVERNMENT.  UNLIKE KHOMEINI\'S CASE, ALLEGIANCE TO </p><p>KHOI\'S RELIGIOUS INTERPRETATIONS DOES NOT NECESSARILY </p><p>MEAN SUPPORT OF A POLITICAL NATURE.  THE ISSUE, AS </p><p>REFTEL POINTED OUT, IS THAT THE LEGITIMACY OF A </p><p>SUCCESSOR REGIME WILL DEPEND TO A MAJOR DEGREE ON </p><p>THE PERCEPTION OF ITS RELIGIOUS CREDENTIALS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  ONE ISSUE OF PARTICULAR INTEREST TO US IS THE </p><p>PRINCIPLE OF THE USULI SCHOOL OF TWELVER SHI\'A </p><p>ISLAM DOMINANT IN IRAN THAT RULINGS OF A CLERIC, </p><p>NO MATTER HOW PROMINENT, LOSE THEIR VALIDITY WHEN </p><p>HE DIES, ENTIRELY UNLIKE THE SUNNIS OR THE MINORITY </p><p>TWELVER SCHOOL WHO HAVE A CORPUS OF CANON LAWS. </p><p>IT IS FOR THIS REASON THAT IRAN HAS A CLERGY AND </p><p>THE ARAB STATES DO NOT IN THE SAME SENSE.  WE </p><p>WOULD THEREFORE EXPECT THE RULINGS OF KHOI, A </p><p>VERY TRADITIONAL CLERIC, NOT TO OUTLIVE HIM. </p><p>WHETHER KHOMEINI\'S WILL IS THE QUESTION.  IF SO, </p><p>HE WILL BE THE FIRST AYATOLLAH TO HAVE A "CALIPH"(SUCC </p><p>ESSOR),  AND SHI\'A ISLAM IN IRAN AND ITS ROLE IN </p><p>THE COUNTRY WILL BE CHANGED IN A SIGNIFICANT WAY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NEWTON </p><p></p></div>
