<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L MADRAS 3155 </p><p> </p><p>E. O. 12356: DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS: PREL, CE, INF </p><p>SUBJECT: N. RAM: LTTE CRUSHED, MAHATHAYA DEAD? </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  "THE HINDU" ASSOCIATE EDITOR N. RAM JUST RETURNED </p><p>FROM A VISIT TO COLOMBO, WHERE HE INTERVIEWED JAYAWARDENE </p><p>AND SPOKE TO MEMBERS OF IPKF, JOURANLISTS AND OTHERS.  HE </p><p>OFFERED THESE THOUGHTS TO CG AND POLECON OFF AT LUNCH </p><p>NOVEMBER 2.: </p><p> </p><p>3. ACCORDING TO JAYAWARDENE AND IPKF SOURCES, THE LTTE </p><p>HAS BEEN CRUSHED AND IS ON THE RUN.  BASED ON LTTE </p><p>INTERCEPTS, RAM IS ALMOST SURE THAT MAHATHAYA (THE LTTE </p><p>NO. 2) WAS KILLED IN THE ASSULT ON CHAVAKACHERI.  INTERCEPTS </p><p>SAID THAT SOMEONE AT THE VERY TOP, BUT NOT PRABHAKARAN, </p><p>WAS KILLED.  RAM BELIEVES THAT THIS COULD ONLY DESCRIBE </p><p>MAHATHAYA.  LOCAL PRESS HAS REPORTED UNCONFIRMED RUMORS </p><p>OF HIS DEATH.  LTTE\'S YOGI HAD TOLD RAM EARLIER THAT </p><p>MAHATHAYA WAS LTTE\'S CANDIDATE FOR CHIEF MINISTER OF THE </p><p>NORTHERN AND EASTERN PROVINCE.  RAM SAID THAT THE INDIAN </p><p>MILITARY ALSO FOUND HIM TO BE SOMEONE WITH WHOM THEY COULD </p><p>DEAL.  HIS DEATH, UNLIKE PRABHAKARNA\'S, WOULD BE A BLOW </p><p>TO A FUTURE NEGOTIATIONS PROCESS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  PRABHAKARAN WAS "CERTAINLY" BEEN WOUNDED IN A </p><p>SEPARATE INCIDENT, PROBABLY WHEN INDIAN PARATROOPERS </p><p>LANDED NEAR HIS HEADWUARTERS.  RAM ALSO FINDS IT VERY </p><p>CURIOUS THAT PRABHAKARAN\'S NAME HAS NOT BEEN USED AT </p><p>ALL BY THE LTTE RECENTLY -"HE\'S COMPLETELY OUT OF SIGHT." </p><p> </p><p>5.  RAM ESTIMATES THAT 1,000 LTTE FIGHTERS HAVE BEEN </p><p>KILLED, INCLUDING 700 IN THE ASSAULT ON CHAVAKACHERI ALONE. </p><p> </p><p>6.  RAM\'S BASIC VIEW OF RECENT EVENTS IN JAFFNA IS MORE </p><p>POSITIVE (FROM AN INDIAN PERSPECTIVE) THAN WE HAVE HEARD </p><p>FROM ANY OTHER KNOWLEDGABLE SOUCE HERE.  IT MUST BE </p><p>CONSIDERED SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE OF HIS RECENT TRIP TO </p><p>COLOMBO AND HIS EARLIER PRE-AGREEMENT CONCERN FOR THE LTTE. </p><p>SUBSTANTIAL CROSS CURRENTS IN TAMIL ELITE OPINION PREVENT </p><p>US FROM DISCERNING ANY "LINE" DOMINANT HERE.  NO ONE HAS </p><p>MUCH REAL SYMPATHY FOR THE LTTE; KARUNANIDI AND THE DMK </p><p>SUPPORT THEM FOR OPPORTUNISTIC REASONS, AND EVEN MGR\'S </p><p>RETURN (BEING COVERED SEPTEL) HAS NOT YET CLARIFIED AIADMK </p><p>THINKING ON THE SUBJECT. </p><p> </p><p>7.  ONE THING RAM WAS CLEAR ON: THE GOI WILL NOT BE </p><p>EASILY LED INTO ANY KIND OF COMPROMISE.  GURKHA TROOPS ARE </p><p>SURROUNDING THE NALLUR TEMPLE NEAR JAFFNA, AND THERE </p><p>WILL BE NO STAND-DOWN, SUSPENSION OF OPERATIONS, OR </p><p>CEASE FIRE UNTIL THE LTTE LOUDLY AND PUBLICLY AGREES TO </p><p>START HANDING OVER ARMS AND ABIDE BY THE JULY 29 AGREEMENT. </p><p>RAM CONFIRMED THE EARLIER REPORTED "NECKLACE KILLINGS" </p><p>OF FIVE INDIAN SOLDIERS AND THE BRUNING TO DEATH OF 13 </p><p>OTHERS.  HE HASTENED TO ADD THAT NONE OF THIS HAS BEEN </p><p>CONFIRMED TO THE PRESS BECUASE THE GOI WANTED TO KEEP </p><p>EMOTIONS DOWN.  BUT THE ARMY KNOWS, AND IT IS PRETTY </p><p>BLOODY-MINDED RIGHT NOW.  PRABHAKARAN OR ANY OTHER </p><p>LEADERSHIP FIGURE WOULD HAVE TO "WAVE A VERY WHITE </p><p>FLAG" TO SURVIVE HIS/THEIR OWN SURRENDER. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STEMPEL </p><p></p></div>
