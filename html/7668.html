<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 002712 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EUR/PGI, EUR/SE, EB/CBED, OES/PCI </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O.12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: SENV, ENRG, TBIO, TU </p><p>SUBJECT:  TURKISH ENVIRONMENT NGOS MORE CONCERNED ABOUT </p><p>BLACK SEA THAN BTC </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary.  Many of the 30 Turkish NGOs and other </p><p>organizations participating in a recent UNDP meeting in </p><p>Ankara expressed concern over the Black Sea coastal </p><p>environment, their limited participation in environmental </p><p>management, and several proposed environmental laws and </p><p>regulations.  They expressed no concern about the BTC </p><p>pipeline but plan to track its construction closely.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  About 80 representatives of 30 NGOs, foundations, </p><p>associations and other organizations from across the country </p><p>participated in a UNDP meeting (4/12- 13) to review 77 small </p><p>grants funded through the Global Environmental Facility </p><p>(GEF) and UNDP.  Most of the NGOs operate on a local rather </p><p>than national level.  They are currently implementing 34 GEF </p><p>projects totaling $800,000 that address a host of issues, </p><p>from the creation of an eNetwork to research on birds to the </p><p>development of environmental plans. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GREATEST CONCERN: BLACK SEA COASTAL ENVIRONMENT </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>3. The NGOs expressed greatest concern about the general </p><p>environment of the Black Sea coastal region and the </p><p>proliferation of polluting sources.  Despite research that </p><p>finds a decrease in rates of pollution, representatives of </p><p>the Black Sea Environmentalists Association (KARCEV) and the </p><p>Turkish Environmental Protection and Woodlands Association </p><p>(TURCEK) believe otherwise based on: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- the emergence of a new "hot spot" (point source of </p><p>pollution) near Samsun created by a mobile power plant that </p><p>uses 1,000 tons daily of fuel oil #6, a particularly heavy </p><p>and potentially environmentally damaging oil. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- leakage from improperly disposed of hazardous waste on </p><p>Sinop\'s shores that increases cancer risk; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- the continual improper disposal of domestic wastewater in </p><p>Trabzon, a municipality unable to design a much-needed deep- </p><p>sea discharge facility for its domestic wastewater; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- degradation and erosion of the land and sea ecology of </p><p>the East Black Sea coastline due to the construction of a </p><p>shore-hugging motorway. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>OF LITTLE CURRENT CONCERN: BTC </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>4.  The 20 participants we spoke with -- without exception - </p><p>- expressed no immediate concerns about BTC.  In fact, they </p><p>characterize the project as "beneficial to the whole </p><p>region."  However, the NGOs will monitor construction </p><p>closely to determine if they will need to take future </p><p>action.  None of the NGOs at the meeting are located along </p><p>the pipeline route. (Comment.  Local NGOs are unfamiliar </p><p>with the EIA format for projects that are internationally </p><p>funded, such as BTC.  They are more familiar with the </p><p>simpler format that the Ministry of Environment (MOE) </p><p>requires for domestically funded projects. End comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>OTHER NGO CONCERNS </p><p>------------------ </p><p>5.  Limited Participation in Environmental Projects.  As an </p><p>example of the limited role that NGOs play in major </p><p>environmental projects, an Istanbul based NGO, the Hunting </p><p>and Wildlife Protection, Development and Promotion </p><p>Association, cited the $20-million World Bank/GEF </p><p>Biodiversity and Resource Management Project.  The project </p><p>is being implemented in Kayseri, Antalya, Artvin, and </p><p>Kirklareli/Igneada but is managed centrally out of Ankara\'s </p><p>Ministry of Forestry (MOF).  Midway through the six-year </p><p>project, only national level NGOs, such as WWF and the </p><p>Turkish Foundation for Combatting Soil Erosion, for </p><p>Reforestation and for the Protection of Natural Habitats </p><p>(TEMA) have been involved. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  Proposed Laws Pending in Parliament.  Turkey\'s </p><p>environmental NGO community is concerned that several </p><p>proposed amendments to existing laws -- specifically, the </p><p>mining law and tourist area laws -- may relax environmental </p><p>standards in sensitive areas.  NGOs are also concerned that </p><p>a proposed amendment regarding the sale of forest areas </p><p>could deflect their efforts to purchase and protect that </p><p>land from development or further degradation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  Lack of Effectiveness of the Civil Society. The MOF and </p><p>MOE are developing Turkey\'s first biodiversity strategy but </p><p>only three NGOs are actively engaged in the process: WWF; </p><p>the Rural Environment and Forestry Problems Research </p><p>Association (KIRCEV), and TEMA.  Some NGOs simply decline to </p><p>participate in the development of new strategies or to </p><p>comment on proposed laws based on past experiences in which </p><p>their voices are not heard.  Others learn of new issues too </p><p>late to participate.  The result is an ineffective </p><p>environmental civil society. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
