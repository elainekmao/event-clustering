(C) ON JUNE 16 UNHCR ATTORNEY MICHIEL SALOMONS </p><p>REPORTED THAT HE HAD RECEIVED NO INFORMATION FROM THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE ON A POSSIBLE PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>DECISION TO RELEASE CUBANS DOCTORS LEONEL CORDOVA </p><p>RODRIGUEZ AND NORIS DEL CARMEN PENA MARTINEZ TO THE </p><p>CUSTODY OF THE UNHCR.  UNHCR REGIONAL REPRESENTATIVE </p><p>OLUSEYI BAJULAIYE SEPARATELY INFORMED AMBASSADOR </p><p>MCDONALD THAT HE WOULD ASK UNHCR HEAD OGATA TO WRITE </p><p>PRESIDENT MUGABE ASKING HIM TO ARRANGE FOR THEIR EARLY </p><p>RELEASE.  SALOMONS SAID HE WAS GOING TO MEET WITH THE </p><p>DUTCH AMBASSADOR ON THE MORNING OF JUNE 16 TO PURSUE THE </p><p>IDEA OF TEMPORARILY RESETTLING THE CUBANS IN THE </p><p>NETHERLANDS (REFTEL).  HE ALSO INFORMED US THAT LOCAL </p><p>UNHCR REPRESENTATIVE JOHN ADU IS TO VISIT THE CUBANS ON </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03264  161115Z </p><p>THE SAME DAY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) COMMENT: WE ARE CONVINCED THAT BAJULAIYE </p><p>SINCERELY WISHES TO REACH AN EARLY SOLUTION TO THE CASE </p><p>OF THE CUBANS DOCTORS THAT IS SATISFACTORY TO ALL.  WE </p><p>ALSO DETECTED EXCESSIVE OPTIMISM ON HIS ORGANIZATION\'S </p><p>PART.  BAJULAIYE IS A COMPETENT AND HARD-WORKING </p><p>DIPLOMAT, BUT HAS LITTLE TO SHOW FOR HIS EFFORTS TO </p><p>DATE.  WE HAVE MADE OUR POSITION QUITE CLEAR, FORCEFULLY </p><p>AND OFTEN, ON A BILATERAL BASIS TO THE GOVERNMENT OF </p><p>ZIMBABWE AND HAVE EXHAUSTED THE POSSIBILITIES FOR </p><p>INTERVENTION.  THE ZIMBABWEAN PRESIDENT IS NOT FOCUSED </p><p>ON THIS PROBLEM ON THE EVE OF AN ELECTION THAT MAY </p><p>DETERMINE HIS PARTY\'S FUTURE.  INDEED, WE DOUBT THAT </p><p>MUGABE EVEN HEARD ABOUT THE CASE ON JUNE 15, PER REFTEL, </p><p>AS WE SAW HIS MOTORCADE ON THE STREETS HEADING TOWARD </p><p>HIS RESIDENCE AT THE TIME THE FOREIGN MINISTRY HAD </p><p>INFORMED THE UNHCR OFFICIALS THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS </p><p>SUPPOSED TO BE BRIEFED.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) ACTION REQUESTED: WE THINK THAT MAXIMUM PRESSURE </p><p>NEEDS TO BE BROUGHT TO BEAR ON UNHCR IN GENEVA.  WHILE </p><p>BAJULAIYE SAID THAT UNHCR HEAD OGATA WOULD WRITE </p><p>PRESIDENT MUGABE, WE THINK THAT A TELEPHONE CALL IS A </p><p>MORE POTENT INSTRUMENT.  DEPARTMENT MAY WISH TO CONTACT </p><p>THE UNITED NATIONS HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR REFUGEES AGAIN </p><p>TO STRESS OUR DESIRE FOR HER PERSONAL INTERVENTION WITH </p><p>THE ZIMBABWEAN HEAD OF STATE IN THIS MATTER. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) ACTION REQUESTED CONTINUED: WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT </p><p>THE POWER OF THE MEDIA COULD BE BROUGHT TO BEAR ON THIS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03264  161115Z </p><p>CASE THROUGH A BACKGROUND BRIEFING FOR REPORTERS CHRIS </p><p>GAITHER AND/OR SANDRA MARQUEZ AT "THE MIAMI HERALD." </p><p>THE AIM OF SUCH A BRIEFING SHOULD BE TO GET "THE MIAMI </p><p>HERALD" TO FOCUS ITS ATTENTION ON THE GOVERNMENT OF </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S UNILATERAL ABILITY TO RESOLVE THE CASE.  THAT </p><p>ATTENTION, IN TURN, MAY HELP THE GOZ UNDERSTAND THAT </p><p>THIS IS AN IMPORTANT CASE, ONE THAT NEEDS TO BE RESOLVED </p><p>NOW. </p><p> </p><p>MCDONALD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
