<p>S E C R E T OTTAWA 001461 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT. FOR NEA/NGA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/22/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, CA, IZ, Iraq </p><p>SUBJECT: CANADA ON RECALL OF IRAQI COM </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 126507 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: POLMIN COUNSELOR BRIAN FLORA.  REASON 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (S) In response to reftel demarche, DFAIT Middle East </p><p>Division Deputy Director Graeme McIntyre affirmed that the </p><p>GOC had taken a decision to facilitate the return to Baghdad </p><p>of Iraqi Charge d\'Affaires Mamdouh S. MUSTAFA, the sole Iraqi </p><p>diplomat remaining in Canada. POL/Liaison sources at post </p><p>advise that CSIS (Canadian intelligence) was unaware of the </p><p>GOC/DFAIT decision to facilitate Mustafa\'s departure from </p><p>Canada. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) According to McIntyre, Mustafa was accredited to </p><p>Canada in 2000/01 as a full Charge d\'Affaires -- as opposed </p><p>to "ad interim"-- after his predecessor, Mohammad H. </p><p>Al-Saffar, failed to resume his post. Though he could not </p><p>give us a timeline for Mustafa\'s departure, McIntyre said it </p><p>would help the GOC if Mustafa were included in the worldwide </p><p>list of former regime officials posted abroad whose departure </p><p>USG previously had encouraged to different host governments. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) McIntyre said the GOC is particularly sensitive to the </p><p>possibility of negative press coverage about Mustafa\'s </p><p>departure (and, probably, the likelihood that left-leaning </p><p>opposition MPs will attack the government decision as a </p><p>"rights" violation etc.). Poloff noted that if Mustafa was </p><p>accredited to Canada as a full charge, then it would appear </p><p>that he fell into the category of "head of mission" and is </p><p>thus covered by the instruction from the Iraqi MFA. </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
