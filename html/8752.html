This is the Southeastern Turkey press summary </p><p>for June 12, 2003.  Please note that Turkish </p><p>press reports often contain errors or </p><p>exaggerations; AmConsulate Adana does not vouch </p><p>for the accuracy of the reports summarized here. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>POLITICAL, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. Hurriyet/Sabah/Milliyet/Tercuman/Dunya/Cumhur iyet </p><p>/Milli Gazete/Bolge/Turkiye/Evrensel: A suicide </p><p>bomber attacked the US Consulate in Adana at </p><p>14:30 yesterday, June 11. The bomber, Cumali </p><p>Kizilkoca (35), tried to enter the Consulate on </p><p>the grounds that he wanted to apply for an </p><p>immigrant visa. Kizilkoca threw two bombs, which </p><p>he had strapped on himself, as he was stopped by </p><p>the security guards. One of the bombs exploded </p><p>immediately while the police detonated the other. </p><p>Some windows of the Consulate building were </p><p>shattered. Kizilkoca shouted, "I attacked the US </p><p>Consulate to protest Israel\'s attack on the </p><p>HAMAS\'leader." While being taken to the Security </p><p>Directorate, he stated, "I attacked to kill </p><p>Americans." In his statement to the police, </p><p>Kizilkoca said, "The suicide attack at HAMAS\' </p><p>leader hurt my pride." It was declared that the </p><p>bomber was intoxicated when he attacked. </p><p>Kizilkoca said he had stolen the bombs from the </p><p>military when he was mustered out. Kizilkoca is </p><p>married and has two children. The police found </p><p>one hundred grams of hash at his house and </p><p>reported the police wanted him for using weapons </p><p>without a license. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  Milliyet: Deputy Governor of Adana, Caner </p><p>Yildiz, disclosed that they would train up to </p><p>sixty volunteers in every quarter of Adana for </p><p>conducting rescue operations in the case of </p><p>natural disasters. He said they also would make </p><p>arrangements for radio communications between the </p><p>Civil Defense Directorate, public offices, and </p><p>big industrial plants. Yildiz said it would be </p><p>impossible for the civil defense experts to reach </p><p>everywhere, therefore all the public offices and </p><p>big industrial plants should take their own </p><p>measures to ensure the safety of their personnel </p><p>and property. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  Milliyet/Radikal: The State Security Court </p><p>(SSC) of Ankara initiated two new investigations </p><p>on DEHAP because of the events experienced during </p><p>its extraordinary meeting in Ankara last weekend. </p><p>The Chief Prosecutor\'s office brought charges </p><p>against the party\'s administrators for not </p><p>chanting the "national anthem" and shouting "pro- </p><p>Ocalan slogans" at the meeting. Another </p><p>investigation has been initiated against DEHAP </p><p>for undertaking actions in favor of the </p><p>separatist organization during its Youth </p><p>Organization\'s meeting fifteen days ago. The </p><p>Chief Public Prosecutor of the Supreme Court, who </p><p>had asked for permanent closure of DEHAP earlier </p><p>is also following the SSC\'s charges closely. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  Milliyet: The PKK/KADEK militant, Mehmet </p><p>Gungordu (AKA Sason), who was in charge of PKK\'s </p><p>team in Cudi Mountain and who surrendered to the </p><p>security forces in Antalya some time ago, is </p><p>being tried at Diyarbakir\'s State Security Court </p><p>(SSC). Gungordu claimed the PKK had seven </p><p>thousand armed militants; it had decided to </p><p>increase the number of the armed groups in the </p><p>Southeast; and, it had four hundred suicide </p><p>bombers at Zab and Kandil regions in Northern </p><p>Iraq waiting for instructions. Gungordu, who is </p><p>facing life imprisonment, told the court that the </p><p>suicide bombers headed by a militant known as </p><p>"Hakki" would undertake actions in big towns in a </p><p>likely conflict with Turkey, and would target </p><p>economic establishments. He said the organization </p><p>had bought anti-aircraft missiles and Docka type </p><p>heavy weaponry. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  Milliyet: TRT (Turkish Radio and Television) </p><p>appealed to the Supreme Court for reversing the </p><p>Regulations About the Language of the Radio and </p><p>Television Broadcasting which permits </p><p>broadcasting in Kurdish. The path for </p><p>broadcasting in Kurdish will be closed should the </p><p>Supreme Court reverse the case or decide on </p><p>halting the execution of the regulation. </p><p>Broadcasting was made permissible after RTUK </p><p>(Radio and Television High Commission) made </p><p>amendments in the RTUK Law for the first EU </p><p>harmonization laws passed last year. RTUK\'s </p><p>arrangements of the regulation based on that law </p><p>came into effect as of December 18, 2002. </p><p>According to the regulation, TRT would broadcast </p><p>Kurdish programs prepared by RTUK\'s experts; </p><p>however, because amendments have not been made in </p><p>TRT\'s Law, TRT demanded the reversal of RTUK\'s </p><p>decision on the grounds that it could not </p><p>broadcast in opposition to its regulations. Only </p><p>private TV channels will be permitted to </p><p>broadcast in Kurdish if the Supreme Court </p><p>reverses the case. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  Evrensel: Thirty-eight people, mostly </p><p>Solidarity Association members, who were detained </p><p>for protesting the US-led war on Iraq in front of </p><p>the AK Party\'s provincial office in Adana, were </p><p>arraigned at Adana\'s State Security Court </p><p>yesterday. The protesters had come from Antakya, </p><p>Mersin, and Adana. The protesters said they were </p><p>exposed to pressure during their detention and </p><p>were forced to sign documents other than their </p><p>own statements, and would file countercharges </p><p>against the Adana Security Directorate and Public </p><p>Prosecutor\'s office. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  Evrensel: Ocalan\'s lawyers and brother were </p><p>not permitted to visit Ocalan at the prison in </p><p>Imrali island on the grounds of adverse weather </p><p>conditions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  Turkiye: Vice Rector of New York State </p><p>University (NYSU), Robert Gosende, who is also in </p><p>charge of NYSU\'s International Programs, visited </p><p>Cukurova University in Adana. Gosende said they </p><p>were looking for areas of cooperation between the </p><p>universities in both countries, and added that </p><p>there already was cooperation in agriculture, </p><p>environment, language, and exchange programs for </p><p>students and teachers between the universities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ECONOMIC AND AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENTS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  Hurriyet: A Memorandum of Understanding </p><p>(MOU) was signed between Diyarbakir Governor, </p><p>Nusret Miroglu, and Gramen Bank\'s Chief Executive </p><p>Officer (CEO), Muhammed Yunus, to implement the </p><p>Micro-credit Project aimed to reduce poverty in </p><p>Diyarbakir. Another cosigner of the MOU, </p><p>Diyarbakir\'s MP from AK Party, Aziz Akgul, said </p><p>they would start giving credits to the poorest </p><p>women in the area and gradually expand the </p><p>project nationwide. The bank\'s CEO, Prof. Dr. </p><p>Yunus, said their project is being applied in one </p><p>hundred and ten countries, and the Turkish Prime </p><p>Minister and media has shown great interest in </p><p>their projects. </p><p>HOLTZ </p><p></p></div>
