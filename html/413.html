<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 MOGADISHU 09903 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINS, EAID, SO </p><p>SUBJ:  NOVEMBER 11 MEETING WITH FOREIGN MINISTER </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A) STATE 380832 (NOTAL)  B) MOGADISHU 09699 </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  THE FOREIGN MINISTER WAS PLEASED TO RECEIVE </p><p>AS COHEN\'S LETTER WELCOMING CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM AND </p><p>ACCEPTED THE POINT THAT THE REGIME\'S COMMITMENT NEEDS TO </p><p>BE  DEMONSTRATED IN CONCRETE FASHION BEFORE IT COULD </p><p>LEAD TO ADDITIONAL RESOURCE FLOWS.  THE MINISTER </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE GSDR HAS OFFERED TO SEND TROOPS </p><p>TO JOIN COALITION FORCES BUT HAD NO WORD ON SAUDI </p><p>REACTION.  HE REPORTED THAT THE PRIME MINISTER\'S TOUR </p><p>OF GCC COUNTRIES IS GOING WELL BUT DENIED ANY KNOWLEDGE </p><p>OF SPECIFIC RESULTS.  HE ASKED FOR HELP PERSUADING THE </p><p>REBEL MOVEMENTS TO ATTEND THE CAIRO CONFERENCE AND FOR </p><p>PRESSURE ON THE ETHIOPIANS TO STOP PROVIDING THEM WITH </p><p>SANCTUARY.  FINALLY, HE EMPHASIZED THE URGENT NEED FOR </p><p>EMERGENCY FOOD SHIPMENTS TO MOGADISHU.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  INTRODUCTION: CALLED ON FOREIGN MINISTER </p><p>AHMED MOHAMED ADEN NOVEMBER 11 TO DELIVER AS COHEN\'S </p><p>SECOND MESSAGE (REFTEL A) AS WELL AS THE LETTER I HAD </p><p>PROMISED THE MINISTER ON THE BROOKE AMENDMENT (REFTEL B). </p><p>ASSISTANT MINISTER BASI TOOK NOTES FOR ADEN.  I WAS </p><p>UNACCOMPANIED. </p><p> </p><p>4.  AMERICAN ASSISTANCE:  AFTER READING COHEN\'S LETTER, </p><p>THE MINISTER ASKED IN EFFECT WHAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT.  I </p><p>EXPLAINED THAT COHEN HAD BEEN CONCERNED BY AD/N\'S </p><p>VERY NEGATIVE RESPONSE TO HIS FIRST LETTER.  HE WANTED </p><p>TO UNDERLINE THAT THE USG APPLAUDS THE GSDR\'S INTENTION </p><p>TO LIBERALIZE THE COUNTRY\'S POLITICAL LIFE.  HOWEVER, </p><p>THERE IS CONSIDERABLE SKEPTICISM IN WASHINGTON ABOUT </p><p>THE GSDR\'S COMMITMENT.  BEFORE REFORM COULD LEAD TO </p><p>RENEWED ASSISTANCE FLOWS, THERE MUST BE EVIDENCE THAT </p><p>THE REFORMS ARE BEING IMPLEMENTED, E.G. POLITICAL </p><p>PARTIES MUST HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO FORM AND INDEPENDENT </p><p>NEWSPAPERS ALLOWED TO PUBLISH.  THE BROOKE PROBLEM </p><p>ALSO MUST BE RESOLVED.  AT THAT POINT, I GAVE AD/N A </p><p>LETTER THE USAID DIRECTOR AND I HAD PREPARED ON BROOKE </p><p>AND ITS LOCAL CONSEQUENCES. </p><p> </p><p>5.  RESPONDING, THE MINISTER SAID HE ACCEPTED THE </p><p>REASONABLENESS OF WASHINGTON\'S SKEPTICISM, "CONSIDERING </p><p>ALL THE HOSTILE PROPAGANDA THERE".  HE VOLUNTEERED </p><p>THAT ON RE-READING COHEN\'S FIRST LETTER HE HAD FOUND IT </p><p>MORE UNDERSTANDABLE THAN ON FIRST REVIEW.  AD/N SAID </p><p>HE REPEATED TO SIAD WHAT I HAD SALD ABOUT THE </p><p>DIVISION OF LABOR IN RESPONDING TO IRAQI AGGRESSION, I.E. </p><p>GCC COUNTRIES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ADDRESSING THE ECONOMIC </p><p>LOSSES EXPERIENCED BY STATES LIKE SOMALIA, WHILE THE </p><p>USG TAKES ON MOST OF THE HUMAN, POLITICAL AND FINANCIAL </p><p>COSTS OF THE MILITARY RESPONSE.  HE HAD NOT, THE </p><p>MINISTER SAID, SHOWN COHEN\'S FIRST LETTER TO SIAD. </p><p> </p><p>6.  PRIME MINISTER\'S MISSION:  ADRN REPORTED THAT HE HAD </p><p>HEARD BY TELEPHONE FROM THE PRIME MINISTER THAT THE </p><p>LATTER\'S TOUR OF GCC STATES IS GOING WELL.  HOWEVER, </p><p>HE SAID, THE PRIME MINISTER HAD NOT BEEN MORE SPECIFIC. </p><p>I THEN ASKED ABOUT THE MINISTER OF INFORMATION\'S PUBLIC </p><p>OFFER TO HAVE SOMALI TROOPS SERVE ALONGSIDE OTHER </p><p>COALITION MILITARY UNITS, AND AN UNCONFIRMED REPORT THAT </p><p>THE SAUDIS HAD ACCEPTED THIS OFFER.  ADEN SAID HE KNEW THE </p><p>OFFER HAD BEEN MADE BUT HE HAD HEARD NOTHING ABOUT ITS </p><p>ACCEPTANCE.  COMMENTING THAT THE GSDR COULD ONLY SEND A </p><p>FEW HUNDRED SOLDIERS, HE ASKED WHAT DIFFERENCE SUCH </p><p>A SMALL NUMBER COULD MAKE.  I RESPONDED THAT THE ACTIVE </p><p>PARTICIPATION OF ANOTHER ARAB LEAGUE STATE IN THE COALI- </p><p>TION\'S MILITARY FORCES WOULD UNDERLINE THAT SADDAM\'S </p><p>AGGRESSION IS ANATHEMA, EVEN TO THOSE OTHERWISE CLOSEST </p><p>TO HIM.  AFTER ASKING A FEW NEUTRAL QUESTIONS ABOUT </p><p>THE DEPLOYMENT OF ADDITIONAL US MILITARY FORCES, THE </p><p>MINISTER EXPRESSED THE HOPE THAT THE CONFLICT CAN </p><p>BE RESOLVED WITHOUT THE OUTBREAK OF WAR. </p><p> </p><p>7.  RECONCILIATION:  STATING THAT PEACE IS NECESSARY </p><p>FOR POLITICAL RECONCILIATION, THE FOREIGN MINISTER </p><p>SAID THE GSDR NEEDS THE HELP OF THE ITALIAN, </p><p>BRITISH AND AMERICAN GOVERNMENTS.  HE ASKED THAT ALL </p><p>THREE MAINTAIN PRESSURE ON THE SOMALI REBEL MOVEMENTS </p><p>TO ATTEND THE CAIRO CONFERENCE AND OTHERWISE ENGAGE IN </p><p>RECONCILIATION WITH SIAD\'S REGIME.  HE ALSO ASKED THAT </p><p>PRESSURE BE BROUGHT TO BEAR ON THE ETHIOPIANS TO STOP </p><p>PROVIDING TO THE REBEL MOVEMENTS THE SANCTUARY WHICH </p><p>ALLOWS THEM TO CONTINUE TO OPERATE. </p><p> </p><p>8.  FOOD AID:  THE MINISTER DESCRIBED HUNGER IN MOGADISHU </p><p>AS AN IMPEDIMENT TO PEACE.  NOTING THAT HE HAD BEEN </p><p>INFORMED BY HIS MINISTERIAL COLLEAGUES OF MY DISCUSSIONS </p><p>WITH THEM ON THE SUBJECT, HE PLEADED FOR FASTER AMERICAN </p><p>ACTION.  THE FRENCH, HE SAID, HAVE AGREED TO PROVIDE </p><p>3,000 TONS OF WHEAT, AND THE ITALIANS ARE TO FURNISH 4,000 </p><p>TONS OF RICE.  I EXPLAINED THAT PREPARATION OF OUR </p><p>PROPOSAL HAS BEEN DELAYED BY THE TIME IT HAS TAKEN TH/ </p><p>RED CRESCENT TO ENGAGE IN SURVEY AND ORGANIZATIONAL WORK </p><p>WITH WHICH IT HAS HAD LITTLE PRIOR EXPERIENCE.  AD/N </p><p>TOOK THE POINT BUT STRESSED THE URGENT NATURE OF THE </p><p>FOOD CRISIS IN THE CAPITAL AND ITS DESTABILIZING POTENTIAL. </p><p> </p><p>9.  APO:  AS THE MEETING ENDED SO THAT THE MINISTER COULD </p><p>MEET WITH SIAD ON THE BROOKE ISSUE, I GAVE HIM THE </p><p>TEXT OF A LETTER REQUIRED AS PART OF OMC\'S PROPOSAL FOR </p><p>ESTABLISHMENT OF AN APO IN MOGADISHU.  I POINTED OUT </p><p>THAT AN APO IS AUTHORIZED BY THE MILITARY ACCESS </p><p>AGREEMENT.  ADEN MADE NO COMMITMENT BUT SEEMED WELL </p><p>DISPOSED. </p><p> </p><p>BISHOP </p><p></p></div>
