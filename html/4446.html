<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 006823 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/21/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, ASEC, PTER, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: USE OF FORCE IN MA\'AN ASSERTS GOJ AUTHORITY, BUT </p><p>LEAVES A BAD TASTE </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. AMMAN 6535 </p><p>     B. AMMAN 6650 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Amb. Edward W. Gnehm for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>MA\'AN OPERATION ONLY A PARTIAL SUCCESS... </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S)  The winding down but not quite completed security </p><p>operation in Ma\'an against Islamic militant leader Mohammed </p><p>Shalibi (aka Abu Sayyaf - refs) has been a decidedly </p><p>unsatisfying operation from the standpoint of most </p><p>Jordanians.  For the government and its staunch supporters, </p><p>the week-long operation clearly demonstrated government </p><p>resolve not to permit an armed group to challenge its </p><p>authority, led to the confiscation of some explosives and </p><p>heavy weapons, and broke up a group that might have used </p><p>them.  It may in the short term reduce the incidents of </p><p>gangsterism committed by Abu Sayyaf\'s group in Ma\'an, acts </p><p>often carried out in the name of an extremist Islam at odds </p><p>with the moderate beliefs of most Jordanians (although </p><p>tolerated by most Ma\'anis).  However, the operation did not </p><p>lead to the arrest of Abu Sayyaf, and netted only a few of </p><p>his supporters.  It also cost at least five lives, two of the </p><p>dead policemen involved in the operation.  Some young members </p><p>of the dead policemen\'s tribe allegedly blamed the government </p><p>for putting their kinsmen into a dangerous situation, and </p><p>attacked a police station in a village near the city of </p><p>Kerak.  (Leaders of the tribe subsequently declared the </p><p>policemen martyrs and reaffirmed the tribe\'s loyalty to King </p><p>and country).  Perhaps most seriously, the militants killed </p><p>in the operation could become martyrs. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>... AND LEAVES A BAD TASTE </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S)  From the standpoint of the citizens of Ma\'an, a </p><p>semblance of order has been restored, and an armed group that </p><p>had previously attacked a police station, taken over the </p><p>hospital, and vandalized the women\'s dormitory at the local </p><p>university has at least been pushed into hiding.  In </p><p>addition, a November 17 visit to Ma\'an of five Ministers, and </p><p>the announcement of a modest increase in money for Ma\'an </p><p>development projects, indicates that the city could get </p><p>greater government attention and support.  (The announced </p><p>program amounts to quick fixes, but longer-term projects in </p><p>the planning stages, such as irrigation and waste disposal, </p><p>may help over time.  The government has not shown much </p><p>interest, though, in addressing the Ma\'anis\' firm conviction </p><p>that they are not getting their fair share of water.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S)  However, Ma\'anis were forced to endure a week of </p><p>siege, closed schools and businesses, and house to house </p><p>searches.  Furthermore, contacts in Ma\'an indicate that many </p><p>in the city consider Abu Sayyaf -- a former government Imam </p><p>who was fired because of his fiery mosque sermons -- to be a </p><p>devout Muslim who incurred the wrath of the government by </p><p>publicizing official corruption.  Foreign correspondents who </p><p>were taken into Ma\'an earlier this week -- as well as embassy </p><p>contacts with connections to Ma\'an -- report many expressions </p><p>of local anger over the government\'s use of force.  Outside </p><p>of Ma\'an, many Jordanians question the timing of the </p><p>operation, variously tying the raid to a perceived need to </p><p>show the U.S. that the GOJ is moving against Islamic </p><p>militants, working hard to catch the killers of Larry Foley, </p><p>or demonstrating that it will not tolerate public disorder as </p><p>violence in the West Bank escalates and a war in Iraq looms. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S)  Many contacts applaud the government\'s goal in Ma\'an </p><p>-- getting rid of an armed band that thought itself above the </p><p>law -- but fault its tactics.  The Ma\'an and Amman rumor </p><p>mills are rife with unflattering (and unconfirmed) stories of </p><p>bad conduct by police and security forces during the Ma\'an </p><p>operation.  Families of arrested militants have accused </p><p>security forces of looting their houses of jewelry and other </p><p>valuables during the searches.  "Eyewitnesses" from Ma\'an </p><p>swear that they saw Jordanian army helicopters firing </p><p>missiles into houses held by militants.  Even though this </p><p>allegation is probably not true, it conjures up for most </p><p>Jordanians images of Israeli helicopters attacking </p><p>Palestinian cities in the West Bank and Gaza.  That a </p><p>significant number of Jordanians are describing the Ma\'an </p><p>operation in these terms should be of concern to the </p><p>government. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (S)  We note that, despite these widespread but vague </p><p>rumors of excesses, we have not heard allegations that </p><p>non-militants were targeted, injured or killed.  One </p><p>independent observer who was allowed to tour the city freely </p><p>on November 18 scoffed at rumors of "war damage" to Ma\'an. </p><p>He found evidence of gunfights, but nothing to support the </p><p>stories about widespread destruction, much less government </p><p>use of missiles or heavy weapons.  Although press reports </p><p>indicate that the government has referred sixty-six </p><p>individuals rounded up in Ma\'an to the State Security Court </p><p>for possible prosecution, the government quickly released a </p><p>number of others -- including non-Jordanians -- who had no </p><p>connection to Abu Sayyaf.  The short detention of the local </p><p>correspondent for al-Jazeera and one of his relatives may </p><p>have contributed to the largely negative coverage of events </p><p>in Ma\'an on the pan-Arab media. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>DID THE GOJ HAVE ANY OTHER CHOICE? </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (S)  Several GOJ officials have argued to us that the </p><p>resort to force in Ma\'an was certainly not ideal, but was </p><p>forced on the government by the militants.  Abu Sayyaf and </p><p>his group posed a direct and armed challenge to government </p><p>authority in Ma\'an -- the group possessed heavy weapons and </p><p>explosives, engaged in a gun battle with police to gain Abu </p><p>Sayyaf\'s release, commandeered a local hospital at gunpoint </p><p>to secure him medical treatment, and Abu Sayyaf made public </p><p>statements that he would not submit to the illegitimate </p><p>government authorities without a fight.  With a well-armed </p><p>and defiant Abu Sayyaf gang essentially running free in </p><p>Ma\'an, the government was put in the unenviable position of </p><p>having to consider the use of force against some of its own </p><p>citizens.  Abu Sayyaf\'s direct public challenge to royal </p><p>authority -- a slap at the honor of the King -- virtually </p><p>assured that the government would take some action. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (S)  Jordanians outside of Ma\'an express little sympathy </p><p>for Abu Sayyaf\'s Islamic militants, and the militants\' </p><p>message of armed resistance to the government does not seem </p><p>to be resonating in other parts of the country.  Most </p><p>recognize that they were an armed gang that had challenged </p><p>governmental authority and Jordan\'s stability. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (S)  Conversely, however, most Jordanians are not </p><p>comfortable with the government\'s use of force.  Many </p><p>Jordanians would have preferred that the government put more </p><p>time and energy into pressing local leaders to come up with a </p><p>proper "tribal" solution, one that would have resulted in a </p><p>reaffirmation of government authority, and custody and trial </p><p>of Abu Sayyaf and his lieutenants, but would have avoided </p><p>laying siege to Ma\'an.  Several sources indicate that the </p><p>anger of many Ma\'anis is being specifically directed against </p><p>the King by name -- a likely formula for further trouble, </p><p>since the security forces will not stand for open disloyalty. </p><p> However, since the message of the militants is not spreading </p><p>outside of Ma\'an, Jordanians are likely to see this episode </p><p>-- like bread and gas price riots in 1989 and 1996 -- as just </p><p>another sad chapter in the history of Jordan\'s most </p><p>politically volatile city. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
