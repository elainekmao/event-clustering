No date has been set yet for the start of a formal peace </p><p>dialogue.  Several international organizations are offering </p><p>help in mediating the process.  Maoist leader Prachanda has </p><p>warned that if the peace talks fail, Nepal would suffer a </p><p>major catastrophe, while the student wing of the Maoists has </p><p>threatened more high-profile killings and mass murder if the </p><p>Government of Nepal is not serious about the ceasefire. </p><p>Nepal\'s political parties have demanded that the details of </p><p>the ongoing peace talks be made public and include all </p><p>parties.  Amnesty International (AI), the National Human </p><p>Rights Commission (NHRC), and local non-governmental </p><p>organizations want human rights to be a priority of the </p><p>peace talks, while victims of the insurgency, women\'s and </p><p>children\'s groups, and Dalits all demand representation at </p><p>the peace talks as well.  NHRC has prepared a draft code of </p><p>conduct to be followed during the ceasefire and is awaiting </p><p>responses from the Maoists and GON. </p><p> </p><p>2.  Summary continued.  Three journalists were released from </p><p>detention on orders of the Supreme Court.  Imprisoned </p><p>Maoists awaiting release staged protest demonstrations </p><p>against the GON.  Security forces arrested suspected Maoists </p><p>in Doti, Kailali and Nawalparasi districts.  Maoists remain </p><p>armed and reportedly are holding mass meetings and </p><p>conducting combat training.  The Maoists reportedly are also </p><p>smuggling in weapons and ammunition from India.  The </p><p>insurgents continue to extort money from civilians and have </p><p>abducted two brothers from their village.  The dead body of </p><p>a man abducted by the Maoists was discovered earlier this </p><p>week.  Children\'s rights activists have demanded that the </p><p>Maoists release all abducted children before proceeding with </p><p>peace talks, and that the GON implement plans to </p><p>rehabilitate children affected by the insurgency.  End </p><p>Summary </p><p> </p><p>SLOW MOVEMENT TOWARD PEACE TALKS, </p><p>INTERNATIONAL HELP OFFERED </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  No date has been set for peace talks between the </p><p>Government of Nepal (GON) and Maoist insurgents.  Prime </p><p>Minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand said the GON sent a letter </p><p>to the Maoists proposing the monarch as focal point of the </p><p>peace talks and was awaiting their response.  Chand said </p><p>that although the GON had conceded to several other demands </p><p>by the Maoists, it had turned down a request to revoke the </p><p>Terrorist and Disruptive Activities Act.  Chand also denied </p><p>accusations by political parties that the ceasefire was put </p><p>together hastily and was intended to exclude the parties. </p><p> </p><p>4.  The Nepal branch of Amnesty International has requested </p><p>that the GON seek international help to monitor the peace </p><p>talks.  According to one of the human rights activists </p><p>present at a meeting with Prime Minister Chand, the Prime </p><p>Minister reacted positively to the idea, calling it a good </p><p>suggestion.  Several other international organizations have </p><p>offered to help with mediation, including the International </p><p>Red Cross and the United Nations, as well as the Government </p><p>of Norway. </p><p> </p><p>5.  The high-profile Carter Center reportedly is ready to </p><p>assist with the peace talks, if both sides are receptive.  A </p><p>local NGO is preparing to invite the former President to </p><p>attend a conference, for members of civil society, about the </p><p>peace process.  The event will be held in Kathmandu. </p><p> </p><p>WARNINGS AND THREATS IF PEACE TALKS FAIL </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  Pushpa Kamal Dahal (AKA Prachanda), leader of the </p><p>Maoists, warned that if peace talks fail this time, Nepal </p><p>would suffer a " major catastrophe," which some have </p><p>interpreted to mean unprecedented bloodshed.  According to </p><p>press reports, Prachanda said that the Maoists are committed </p><p>to the ceasefire, and warned political parties not to repeat </p><p>past mistakes of infighting and indifference.  In a </p><p>statement released on February 13, the anniversary of the so- </p><p>called "People\'s War," Prachanda declared the ceasefire a </p><p>"strategic balancing act" and a "continuation of the war by </p><p>other means." </p><p> </p><p>7.  Prachanda warned against any conspiracies, hatched by </p><p>the "outgoing regime and the imperialist and expansionist </p><p>forces," declaring that his army was ready to go back to the </p><p>jungle with "guns in hand."  The Maoists have said that in </p><p>order for peace talks to succeed, all parties involved must </p><p>be serious about and committed to the peace process; the </p><p>Government of Nepal (GON) needs to make public the names and </p><p>whereabouts of imprisoned or missing suspected Maoists; the </p><p>army must suspend all operations and return to its barracks, </p><p>and a code of conduct must be established. </p><p> </p><p>8.  The All-Nepal National Independent Students Union-- </p><p>Revolutionary (ANNISU-R) has threatened the GON with </p><p>unprecedented violence if it is not serious about the </p><p>ceasefire.  Dipendra Panta, chairman of ANNISU-R, speaking </p><p>at a mass meeting commemorating the anniversary of the </p><p>People\'s War, warned that the brutal attacks in Dang and </p><p>Syangja (Ref A) could be repeated in other places at any </p><p>time.  The militants also made reference to the vicious </p><p>murders of Krishna Mohan Shrestha, Chief of the Armed Police </p><p>Force (Ref B), threatening that new tactics targeting high </p><p>officials could be implemented, and the ceasefire could turn </p><p>into the "drama before mass murder." </p><p> </p><p>POLITICAL PARTIES REACT TO CEASEFIRE </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>9.  Amik Sherchan, leader of the People\'s Front Nepal (PFN), </p><p>told the press that Maoist leader Prachanda met with a </p><p>special emissary of the King before the ceasefire was </p><p>announced.  Sherchan claimed that Prachanda told him of the </p><p>meeting and that the Maoists agreed to the ceasefire as </p><p>proposed by the emissary.  Sherchan stressed the need to </p><p>have all political parties involved in the peace process, </p><p>saying that only a "united movement" can solve current </p><p>national problems. </p><p> </p><p>10.  Jog Mehar, a central member of the Rastriya Prajatantra </p><p>Party (RPP), warned that the Maoists might use the ceasefire </p><p>to regroup.  Mehar reiterated that a code of conduct must be </p><p>established for the duration of the ceasefire and peace </p><p>talks.  Mehar, speaking at the Reporter\'s Club, also </p><p>ridiculed the idea of an all-party round table conference, </p><p>one of the Maoists\' main demands. </p><p> </p><p>11.  Madhav Kumar Nepal, General Secretary of the Communist </p><p>Party of Nepal-United Marxist Leninist (CPN-UML) said that </p><p>the GON should not rush into peace talks.  Nepal admitted </p><p>talking to Maoist leader Prachanda by phone, but denied any </p><p>secret agreements between the two.  Nepal, speaking at a </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>press conference, said both sides should do their homework </p><p>before sitting at the negotiating table or the talks would </p><p>fail again.  Nepal said that the agenda must be defined </p><p>clearly and also asked the GON to rehabilitate those who had </p><p>been displaced by the insurgency.  Nepal also demanded that </p><p>the details of the peace talks be made public, citing </p><p>concern that political parties are not being consulted.  In </p><p>addition to the CPN-UML, the Rastriya Prajatantra Party </p><p>(RPP), Nepali Congress (Democratic), and Nepal Sadbhavana </p><p>Party (NSP) also have insisted that the details of the peace </p><p>dialogue be made public. The parties said the confusing and </p><p>uncertain atmosphere surrounding the talks must end. </p><p> </p><p>12.  Narayan Man Bijukchhe, President of Nepal Workers and </p><p>Peasants\' Party (NWPP), criticized the GON for accepting too </p><p>many of the demands made by the Maoists.  Bijukchhe called </p><p>it humiliating and said the GON was conceding too much too </p><p>soon.  He lambasted the Maoists\' demands for space and time </p><p>in the media, and their call for military withdrawal. </p><p>Bijukchhe expressed doubts over the GON\'s ability to bring </p><p>the Maoists to the negotiating table. </p><p> </p><p>13.  The United Kingdom and Switzerland have both pledged </p><p>continued support to Nepal and called on the GON and all </p><p>parties involved in the ceasefire to agree on a common </p><p>vision for Nepal to make the ceasefire permanent.  Keith </p><p>Bloomfield, the British Ambassador to Nepal, pledged </p><p>continued support to Nepal, including strengthening of </p><p>security forces, while Walter Fust, the Director General of </p><p>the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC), in a </p><p>recent visit to Nepal, said the Swiss too would continue </p><p>their aid programs in Nepal. </p><p> </p><p>MAOISTS HOLD MEETINGS, TAKE UP ARMS </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  In Khotang District, armed insurgents have been holding </p><p>mass meetings that students, teachers and local villagers </p><p>are being forced to attend.  According to the villagers, the </p><p>Maoists expressed anger about the GON\'s failure so far to </p><p>announce a negotiating team, and said that if the GON failed </p><p>to meet the Maoists\' conditions, there would be no other </p><p>option than to take up arms again.  The insurgents </p><p>reportedly have launched combat training exercises in the </p><p>district, with as many as 5,000 people participating. </p><p> </p><p>15.  A CPN-UML activist in Nepalgunj District has reported </p><p>that Maoists have stepped up extortion campaigns throughout </p><p>the district.  They also have taken up arms and are </p><p>conducting mass meetings, proclaiming that the insurgents </p><p>have won the struggle with the GON.  There are also reports </p><p>from the district that the Maoists are bringing in </p><p>ammunition and weapons from India. </p><p> </p><p>16.  Journalists from the local press visited Jumla </p><p>District, one of the areas hardest hit by the Maoist </p><p>insurgency, and reported that the militants are still armed </p><p>and ready to fight again should the peace talks fail.  Over </p><p>one hundred insurgents carrying weapons were observed, many </p><p>of whom were children.  Insurgents in the area were quoted </p><p>as saying that if the government tried to trick the Maoists, </p><p>they would re-launch their violent campaign and it would be </p><p>more severe than last time. </p><p> </p><p>SECURITY FORCES ARREST MAOISTS </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>17.  Security forces reportedly arrested three Maoists, </p><p>including the regional leader, in Nawalparasi District on </p><p>February 8. Area police denied any knowledge of the arrests. </p><p>Maoists have been organizing daily public meetings </p><p>throughout the district. </p><p> </p><p>18.  In Doti District, three Maoists also were arrested by </p><p>security forces after they were seen carrying arms and </p><p>explosives.  Security forces also arrested twelve Maoists </p><p>returning from a mass gathering in Kailali District who were </p><p>openly walking with guns. </p><p> </p><p>PRIORITY FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND REPRESENTATION </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>19.  The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) is awaiting </p><p>responses from the GON and the Maoists to its proposed code </p><p>of conduct for the ceasefire.  The six-point draft, which </p><p>was sent to both the GON and Maoist leader Prachanda, calls </p><p>for an immediate stop to nationwide extortion, kidnapping </p><p>and violence perpetrated by the Maoists.  The draft also </p><p>asks the GON to order the army back to its barracks and </p><p>revoke the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities Act.  The </p><p>NHRC has also advised both sides to form groups to monitor </p><p>and observe adherence to the code of conduct. </p><p> </p><p>20.  Amnesty International (AI) demanded that human rights </p><p>be given top priority in the upcoming peace talks.  In its </p><p>recent meeting of the Nepal branch, AI requested that the </p><p>GON and the Maoists stop all abductions, killings, torture, </p><p>curfews and search and destroy missions. AI also called for </p><p>the implementation of a program to rehabilitate children </p><p>used as soldiers in the Maoist insurgency, and called for </p><p>the release of all people arrested under the Terrorist and </p><p>Destructive Control Act. </p><p> </p><p>21.  Human rights organizations in Nepal are urging the </p><p>United Nations Human Rights Commission (UNHRC) to appoint a </p><p>special investigator for Nepal to investigate cases of human </p><p>rights violations during the period from February 1996 to </p><p>January 2003.  The groups want representation for women, </p><p>children, and indigenous people in the peace talks, and have </p><p>appealed to the Maoists to stop extorting funds, kidnapping </p><p>people, disrupting education, and to release all child </p><p>soldiers.  According to a report compiled by local non- </p><p>governmental organizations, children comprise thirty percent </p><p>of the Maoists\' fighting force. </p><p> </p><p>22.  Child Rights Watch-Nepal (CRW-N), a newly formed </p><p>organization comprised of local children\'s rights groups, </p><p>has demanded that the peace talks focus on rehabilitating </p><p>children affected by the insurgency.  In its annual report, </p><p>Child Workers in Nepal (CWIN) said thousands of children had </p><p>been orphaned and displaced as a result of the insurgency. </p><p>CRW-N is insisting that the GON makes issues facing these </p><p>children a priority of the peace talks. </p><p> </p><p>23.  In addition, the human rights groups want the GON and </p><p>Maoists to make public the names of missing civilians. </p><p>According to a report prepared by the organizations, twenty- </p><p>eight people have disappeared from the mid-western district </p><p>of Rukum and are presumed dead.  The groups are calling for </p><p>compensation to the families and investigations into the </p><p>disappearances. </p><p> </p><p>24.  In a report released on February 13, the National Dalit </p><p>Commission claims that the violence, murder, arrests and </p><p>disappearances that have occurred during the Maoist </p><p>insurgency have largely affected the Dalit (low caste) </p><p>community.  The report says that almost 200 members of the </p><p>Dalit community have been killed in the Maoist affected </p><p>districts of Dang, Bardiya, Kailali and Jumla by security </p><p>forces and thirty-two others were killed by Maoists.  The </p><p>commission wants representation in the peace talks, accusing </p><p>the GON and the Maoists of sidelining their concerns, and </p><p>have warned of grave consequences if they are not included </p><p>in the peace talks. </p><p> </p><p>25.  Victims of the Maoist insurgency are also demanding </p><p>that attention be given to their plight.  K. P. Adhikare, </p><p>Chairman of the Society For Victims of Terror, said that the </p><p>victims of the insurgency are the ones who have lost the </p><p>most and deserve to be represented in the talks.  Many of </p><p>the victims and their families are still awaiting </p><p>compensation from the GON, which they claim has never been </p><p>distributed. </p><p> </p><p>IMPRISONED MAOISTS WAIT FOR RELEASE, PROTEST AGAINST GON </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p> </p><p>26.  The Home Ministry has said it would not immediately </p><p>release imprisoned Maoists.  According to press reports, </p><p>Prime Minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand had previously </p><p>reassured Narayan Singh Pun, Minister of Physical Planning </p><p>and Works and government-appointed peace talks coordinator, </p><p>that he would order the release of all detained Maoists. </p><p>Pun reportedly has been under pressure to ask the King to </p><p>grant a general amnesty to all imprisoned insurgents, as a </p><p>precondition for peace talks. </p><p> </p><p>27.  On February 12, Minister Pun was called to the Central </p><p>Jail in Kathmandu, when prisoners began demonstrating </p><p>against the GON, shouting anti-government slogans and </p><p>demanding their release.  Prisoner Rabindra Shrestha, a </p><p>central member of the Maoist party, said that the ceasefire </p><p>would be called off if their demands were not met, and </p><p>threatened the GON with a strike within the prison if the </p><p>Maoists were not set free.  Pun told the prisoners that he </p><p>would take the matter up with the Prime Minister and the </p><p>Home Minister. </p><p> </p><p>28.  Prisoners in Nakkhua Jail also demonstrated against the </p><p>GON on February 10, accusing it of not being serious about </p><p>peace talks and ignoring the demands of the Maoists.  The </p><p>protests began after attempts were made to re-arrest a </p><p>prisoner shortly after the District Administration Office </p><p>ordered his release.  Minister Pun was called to the prison </p><p>and was handed a letter by the prisoners demanding the </p><p>release of all imprisoned Maoists before peace talks can </p><p>begin. </p><p> </p><p>29.  The local press has reported that some prisoners have </p><p>been released, but are refusing to leave jail for fear of </p><p>being re-arrested.  As many as eleven prisoners were given </p><p>release orders from the Central Jail in Kathmandu, but </p><p>refused to leave.  The prisoners are demanding that human </p><p>rights representatives be present at their release.  Maoists </p><p>are warning that the prison issues could disrupt the </p><p>ceasefire. </p><p> </p><p>30.  According to the Siraha District Administration Office, </p><p>fifteen suspected Maoists were released from jail in Siraha </p><p>District on February 11.  Thirty-one people still remain in </p><p>jail on suspicion of being Maoists.  In Banke District seven </p><p>Maoist activists were released on February 12. </p><p> </p><p>JOURNALISTS RELEASED FROM PRISON </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>31.  Following orders from the Supreme Court, the GON </p><p>released three journalists from the Central Jail in </p><p>Kathmandu.  Two of the journalists worked for Janadisha, a </p><p>pro-Maoist newspaper.  The journalists were arrested under </p><p>the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities Act, after the </p><p>imposition of the State of Emergency in November 2001.  The </p><p>Federation of Nepalese Journalists praised the release and </p><p>demanded that the remaining detained journalists be released </p><p>as well. </p><p> </p><p>32.  According to the Centre For Human Rights and Democratic </p><p>Studies, there are at least fifteen journalists who remain </p><p>in jail on charges of being sympathetic to the Maoists. </p><p>Gopendra Pandey, Home Ministry spokesman, said there was no </p><p>time frame for when the rest of the journalists would be </p><p>freed.  Media organizations have called the arrests of </p><p>journalists an indication of the deterioration of press </p><p>freedom in Nepal. </p><p> </p><p>CEASEFIRE DOESN\'T STOP EXTORTION AND KIDNAPPING </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>33.  There are reports from Ilam, Dang, Baglung and Sindhuli </p><p>Districts of increased extortion efforts by the Maoists. </p><p>Police arrested four Maoists in southwestern Dang District </p><p>on charges of extorting money from villagers.  Police </p><p>recovered cash and donation receipts from the insurgents. </p><p>Local press from eastern Ilam District and Sindhuli District </p><p>also report that Maoists are going house-to-house, extorting </p><p>money from everyone.  The insurgents reportedly claim that </p><p>all their activities are to continue as normal, despite the </p><p>ceasefire.  In northwestern Baglung District, the insurgents </p><p>are demanding food, grain and cash from villagers. </p><p> </p><p>34.  In western Surkhet District, Maoists reportedly have </p><p>abducted two brothers, whose whereabouts remain unknown. </p><p>The insurgents have also stepped up their demands for </p><p>donations from businessmen and teachers. </p><p> </p><p>35.  The body of a man abducted from Dang District almost a </p><p>month ago by Maoists was discovered on February 11. Maoists </p><p>sent a letter to the man\'s father on February 7, declaring </p><p>that his son was killed for being an informant for security </p><p>forces. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
