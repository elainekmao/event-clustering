<p>S E C R E T SEOUL 03039 </p><p> </p><p>S/CT FOR WHARTON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL:  OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PTER, KS </p><p>SUBJECT:  REPUBLIC OF KOREA:  1987 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT </p><p> </p><p>REF:  STATE 42378 </p><p> </p><p>1.  SECRET - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  CLASSIFIED SECTION FOR THE REPORT FOR THE REPUBLIC OF </p><p>KOREA FOLLOWS: </p><p> </p><p>U.S.-ROK BILATERAL COOPERATION: </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3.  ROK COUNTERTERRORISM UNITS TRAINED WITH U.S. CT FORCES </p><p>ON MANY OCCASIONS IN 1988.  THE JADE NUGGET EXERCISE IN </p><p>JUNE INCLUDED ROKG PLAYER AND OBSERVER CELLS.  A SIMILAR </p><p>THOUGH MORE ELABORATE ROK-US EXERCISE, JADE NUGGET 88, IS </p><p>PLANNED FOR JUNE OF THIS YEAR.  EXERCISE IVY CRAWLER IN </p><p>OCTOBER 1987 WAS AN EXTREMELY INVOLVED ROK-US EFFORT.  THE </p><p>SCENARIO POSITED THREE TERRORIST SITES IN COMMUNICATION </p><p>WITH ONE ANOTHER AND REQUIRED BOTH GOVERNMENTAL AND </p><p>MILITARY COORDINATION.  U.S. FORCES TOOK DOWN ONE SITE, </p><p>ROK FORCES ANOTHER, WHILE AN INTEGRATED FORCE TOOK DOWN THE </p><p>THIRD.  IT WAS A COMPLEX EXERCISE AND OF GREAT VALUE IN </p><p>EVALUATING UNILATERAL AND COOPERATIVE METHODS AND </p><p>CAPABILITIES.  FURTHER MILITARY COOPERATION INCLUDED FIVE </p><p>SMALL UNIT EXCHANGE/TRAINING EXERCISES, BOMB DOG, AND </p><p>EXPLOSIVE ORDINANCE DEMOLITION TRAINING. </p><p> </p><p>4.  THE USG HAS ALSO PROVIDED COUNTERTERRORISM ASSISTANCE </p><p>AND TRAINING THROUGH A VARIETY OF AGENCIES INCLUDING </p><p>CUSTOMS, INS, FBI, FAA, AND SIRO (S/NF).  FURTHER DETAILS </p><p>OF SIRO (S/NF) COUNTERTERRORISM ASSISTANCE TO THE ROK ARE </p><p>RESTRICTED TO SIRO (S/NF) REPORTING CHANNELS. </p><p> </p><p>JUDICIAL RESPONSE: </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  DURING EXERCISE IVY CRAWLER, ROK OFFICIALS RESISTED </p><p>ATTEMPTS BY U.S. PLAYERS TO TRY TO EXERCISE LEGAL </p><p>JURISDICTION OVER TERRORISTS ACTING AGAINST U.S. CITIZENS </p><p>ON A U.S. INSTALLATION AND CAPTURED BY U.S. FORCES.  WHILE </p><p>THIS EXAMPLE OF EXERCISE PLAY CANNOT BE TAKEN AS AN </p><p>OFFICIAL ROKG POSITION AS HIGH-LEVEL ROKG DECISION-MAKERS </p><p>DID NOT TAKE PART, WE BELIEVE IT A LIKELY RESPONSE. </p><p>NONETHELESS, SHOULD THE ROKG DECIDE NOT TO EXTRADITE THE </p><p>USG WOULD PROBABLY FIND A KOREAN LEGAL DECISION </p><p>ACCEPTABLE, AS ROKG AND U.S. POLICIES ON TERRORISM AND </p><p>TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS ARE GENERALLY IN AGREEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>NORTH KOREA: </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  WE ASSUME THAT PREPARATION OF THE DEPARTMENT\'S REPORT </p><p>ON NORTH KOREA CAN BEST BE PREPARED IN WASHINGTON. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LILLEY </p><p></p></div>
