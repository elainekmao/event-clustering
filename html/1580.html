REASONS: 1.5 </p><p>(B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>ACTING CHIEF JUSTICE SWORN IN </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) IN A LONG-EXPECTED MOVE, PRESIDENT MUGABE SWORE IN </p><p>HIGH COURT JUDGE PRESIDENT GODFREY CHIDYAUSIKU AS ACTING </p><p>CHIEF JUSTICE OF THE ZIMBABWEAN SUPREME COURT ON MARCH 13. </p><p>CHIDYAUSIKU WILL SERVE IN AN ACTING CAPACITY AT LEAST UNTIL </p><p>THE FORMAL RETIREMENT OF CHIEF JUSTICE ANTHONY GUBBAY, </p><p>CURRENTLY ON LEAVE UNTIL JUNE 30.  THE CEREMONY AT STATE </p><p>HOUSE WAS ATTENDED BY GUBBAY\'S FOUR COLLEAGUES ON THE BENCH </p><p>-- BUT NOT GUBBAY HIMSELF -- JUDGES FROM THE HIGH COURT, </p><p>JUSTICE MINISTER PATRICK CHINAMASA, OTHER CABINET </p><p>MINISTERS, AND ATTORNEY-GENERAL ANDREW CHIGOVERA.  THE </p><p>EVENT RECEIVED PROMINENT COVERAGE IN THE GOVERNMENT- </p><p>CONTROLLED PRINT AND BROADCAST MEDIA. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) THE GOVERNMENT\'S INTENTION TO REPLACE GUBBAY WITH </p><p>THE PRO-ZANU-PF CHIDYAUSIKU HAS LONG BEEN AN OPEN SECRET, </p><p>AND THE CHIEF JUSTICE\'S MARCH 2 AGREEMENT WITH THE GOZ </p><p>CONCERNING HIS EARLY RETIREMENT (REF A) MADE THIS POSSIBLE. </p><p>TWO PRIMARY QUESTIONS NOW REMAIN UNANSWERED: WILL </p><p>CHIDYAUSIKU, DURING HIS THREE-AND-A-HALF MONTHS AS ACTING </p><p>CHIEF JUSTICE, BE ABLE TO HELP DISLODGE HIS FOUR NEW </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01018  01 OF 02  141608Z </p><p>COLLEAGUES, AND WILL HE REPLACE GUBBAY PERMANENTLY WHEN THE </p><p>CHIEF JUSTICE FORMALLY RETIRES ON JUNE 30? </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) THE FIRST QUESTION IS OPEN TO INTERPRETATION, AS </p><p>NEITHER THE CONSTITUTION NOR HISTORICAL PRECEDENT ADDRESSES </p><p>THE POWERS EXERCISED BY AN ACTING CHIEF JUSTICE WHILE THE </p><p>CHIEF JUSTICE IS COMPETENT AND REMAINS IN THE COUNTRY. </p><p>GUBBAY\'S VIEW, AS ELABORATED ON MARCH 10 TO VISITING AF </p><p>A/PDAS MARK BELLAMY, WAS THAT ONLY GUBBAY -- UNTIL HIS </p><p>RETIREMENT -- HAS THE AUTHORITY TO RECOMMEND TO THE </p><p>PRESIDENT CONVOCATION OF A TRIBUNAL TO INVESTIGATE THE </p><p>EXPULSION OF JUDGES FROM THE BENCH.  STERNFORD MOYO, </p><p>PRESIDENT OF THE LAW SOCIETY OF ZIMBABWE, AGREED WITH </p><p>GUBBAY, TELLING US ON MARCH 14 THAT, DURING THIS INTERIM </p><p>PERIOD, CHIDYAUSIKU\'S RECOMMENDING ESTABLISHMENT OF A </p><p>TRIBUNAL ON HIS OWN -- WITHOUT CONSULTING GUBBAY -- WOULD </p><p>BE UNCONSTITUTIONAL.  PRESIDENT MUGABE AND HIS ADVISORS </p><p>LIKELY WILL TAKE THE OPPOSITE VIEW, AS THEY ARE ANXIOUS TO </p><p>REPLACE THE COURT\'S INDEPENDENT-MINDED JURISTS WITH JUDGES </p><p>MORE WILLING TO GIVE THE GOVERNMENT A PASS ON THE RULE OF </p><p>LAW. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) GUBBAY SURMISED TO BELLAMY THAT, SINCE THE TRIBUNAL </p><p>ROUTE IS SO FRAUGHT WITH CONSTITUTIONAL PITFALLS AND SINCE </p><p>CHIDYAUSIKU CANNOT ALONE CARRY ZANU-PF\'S WATER, MUGABE </p><p>LIKELY WOULD TAKE THE EASIER -- AND LEGAL -- PATH OF SIMPLY </p><p>PACKING THE COURT WITH ADDITIONAL, POLITICALLY SYMPATHETIC </p><p>JUDGES.  WE HAVE HEARD THAT JUSTICE MINISTER PATRICK </p><p>CHINAMASA HAS QUIETLY APPROACHED SEVERAL BLACK LAWYERS </p><p>ABOUT ACCEPTING JUDICIAL APPOINTMENTS, ALTHOUGH IT IS </p><p>UNCLEAR FOR WHICH COURT HE WAS RECRUITING.  GUBBAY TOLD </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  01018  01 OF 02  141608Z </p><p>BELLAMY HE FULLY EXPECTS CHIDYAUSIKU TO BE NAMED AS HIS </p><p>PERMANENT REPLACEMENT BEGINNING JULY 1.  STERNFORD MOYO, </p><p>HOWEVER, SEPARATELY TOLD THE ACTING AF P/DAS THAT HE AND </p><p>OTHER MEMBERS OF THE JUDICIAL SERVICES COMMISSION -- </p><p>CHARGED BY THE CONSTITUTION WITH ADVISING THE PRESIDENT ON </p><p>JUDICIAL NOMINEES -- WERE WORKING TO TRY TO BLOCK </p><p>CHIDYAUSIKU\'S ASCENSION TO THE APEX OF ZIMBABWE\'S </p><p>JUDICIARY. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) WE SUSPECT THE GOZ IS EAGER TO INSTALL A PLIANT </p><p>SUPREME COURT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, AS THE COURT MIGHT SOON </p><p>CONSIDER SEVERAL CONSTITUTIONAL CASES THAT COULD HAVE A </p><p>DIRECT IMPACT ON THE RULING PARTY\'S POLITICAL PROGRAM.  THE </p><p>HIGH COURT, FOR INSTANCE, IS CURRENTLY HEARING CHALLENGES </p><p>TO THE RESULTS IN 37 CONSTITUENCIES IN LAST JUNE\'S </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS.  A DECISION BY THE HIGH COURT TO </p><p>INVALIDATE THE RESULTS IN ANY OF THOSE CONSTITUENCIES -- </p><p>AND TO CALL FOR NEW ELECTIONS TO FILL THE SEATS -- WOULD </p><p>WITHOUT DOUBT BE APPEALED TO THE SUPREME COURT.  IN </p><p>ADDITION, THE MDC PLANS TO CHALLENGE THE CONSTITUTIONALITY </p><p>OF THE REPRESSIVE COLONIAL-ERA LAW AND ORDER MAINTENANCE </p><p>ACT (LOMA), WHICH THE GOZ HAS USED TO CRACK DOWN ON LEADING </p><p>OPPOSITION FIGURES, INCLUDING MDC PRESIDENT MORGAN </p><p>TSVANGIRAI AND HIS VICE-PRESIDENT GIBSON SIBANDA.
