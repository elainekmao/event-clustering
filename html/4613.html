JONES; REASON 1.5 (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  Jalal Talabani, leader of the Iraqi Kurdish </p><p>PUK, told Ambassador December 3 he had been well received by </p><p>the GOK, which promised to engage with other Iraqi opposition </p><p>groups as well, and to facilitate contacts with other Gulf </p><p>states.  Kuwait\'s National Assembly had proposed to host a </p><p>small conference on the future of Iraqi-Kuwaiti relations, as </p><p>early as next month.  Talabani expressed assurances that the </p><p>PUK was committed to a federal, democratic Iraq respectful of </p><p>human rights, with much smaller armed forces.  He said he had </p><p>also had good meetings with the French government in Paris. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) At his request (conveyed via NEA/NGA), Jalal </p><p>Talabani, the leader of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan </p><p>(PUK), called on the Ambassador December 3, accompanied by </p><p>Adnan Mufti and Adel Murad.  PolChief sat in as Notetaker. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) HIGH-LEVEL WELCOME: Talabani, who arrived at the </p><p>Embassy with a substantial Kuwaiti security escort, noted </p><p>that this was his second visit to Kuwait since the liberation </p><p>in 1991.  He was very pleased with the welcome he had </p><p>received from the GOK, including a symbolic meeting with the </p><p>Crown Prince/Prime Minister, whose debility precludes him </p><p>from carrying out official duties in any substantive way.  He </p><p>had also met with the man who actually runs the country, </p><p>First Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Shaykh Sabah </p><p>al-Ahmed, as well as with Deputy Prime Minister and Interior </p><p>Minister Shaykh Mohammed al-Khaled al-Sabah, Minister of </p><p>State for Foreign Affairs Shaykh Dr. Mohammed al-Sabah, </p><p>Speaker of the National Assembly Jassem al-Khorafi, and </p><p>Chairman of the Assembly\'s Foreign Relations Committee </p><p>Mohammed al-Saqer.  A planned courtesy call on the Amir was </p><p>scrapped at the last minute on the advice of the ruler\'s </p><p>doctor. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) SUBSTANCE OF TALKS:  Talabani told the Ambassador that </p><p>Shaykh Sabah was keen to cooperate with the US to get rid of </p><p>Saddam, and did not express any need for a UNSCR authorizing </p><p>use of force.  Shaykh Sabah promised to engage with other </p><p>Iraqi opposition groups and facilitate contacts between the </p><p>opposition and other Gulf states.  The National Assembly\'s </p><p>al-Saqer had promised to attend the upcoming London </p><p>conference of the Iraqi opposition, and Shaykh Sabah had </p><p>promised to send an observer as well.  (Talabani summarized </p><p>the purposes of that conferences as follows:  unite all Iraqi </p><p>opposition groups\' appeals to the population; discuss how to </p><p>reshape Iraq as a democratic country after Saddam; establish </p><p>a coordinating/steering committee.)  The Kuwaiti National </p><p>Assembly proposed to host a small conference on the future of </p><p>Iraqi-Kuwaiti relations, perhaps as early as next month.  If </p><p>the event took place in January, Talabani said, he would plan </p><p>to participate in person; if later, he would send Mufti and </p><p>Murad. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) COMMITMENT TO DEMOCRACY:  Talabani stressed to the </p><p>Ambassador, as he said he had done to the Kuwaitis, his </p><p>commitment to democratization of Iraq, preservation of </p><p>national unity in a federal system, and respect for human </p><p>rights.  He said it was important to cultivate political ties </p><p>across ethnic and religious lines in advance of regime </p><p>change, in order to avoid problems afterwards.  In this </p><p>spirit, the PUK had decided to give 8 of its seats at the </p><p>London Conference to Sunni Arabs.  Even though the Kurds had </p><p>suffered casualties equal to the total number of Kuwaiti </p><p>citizens, they did not hate the Iraqi people, just the </p><p>regime.  Talabani agreed with the Ambassador that Iraq needs </p><p>strong institutions and the rule of law, not a strong man. </p><p>He thought a three-person presidential council should be part </p><p>of the new political structure of the Iraqi state.  Noting </p><p>that there are already 4 million Iraqis outside the country, </p><p>he made the point that national unity has already been </p><p>broken; regime change will help restore it.  In his view, </p><p>Iraq needs no more than about 50,000 troops, i.e. about a </p><p>tenth of the current level.  A well-trained police force will </p><p>be an early and essential need. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) DEALING WITH TURKEY:  Talabani said he had assured </p><p>the Turkish Government that "we don\'t want or need an </p><p>independent Kurdish state," but a "better life and our </p><p>rights."  He said the GOT had decided to talk to the Iraqi </p><p>opposition.  He described the new Turkish Cabinet as people </p><p>he knew, who were committed to raising democracy to European </p><p>standards, amending the Constitution to prohibit torture, </p><p>promoting political and press freedoms, and giving the Kurds </p><p>more space:  recognizing their language, ending the 4-year </p><p>curfew in Kurdish areas.  As for ex-PM Ecevit, Talabani said </p><p>he was a paid agent of Saddam and deserved his recent </p><p>electoral come-uppance. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) MEETINGS WITH FRENCH:  Noting that he had just come </p><p>from Paris, Talabani said he had had "very good meetings" </p><p>with French officials including the Interior Minister, </p><p>MinState for Foreign Affairs, Speaker of the Senate, and </p><p>ex-FM Vedrine.  All had supported regime change and democracy </p><p>in Iraq, expressing hatred of Saddam, he said.  Vedrine had </p><p>publicly proposed at an international conference that Saddam </p><p>be replaced even if he gives up all WMD. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) ON TO WASHINGTON:  After the London conference, </p><p>Talabani said, he would go on to Washington with the other </p><p>top Iraqi Kurdish leader, the KDP\'s Barzani.  He praised US </p><p>Ambassador to Egypt David Welch for his role in brokering the </p><p>Washington Agreement, which he said was being implemented: </p><p>"we are uniting our positions, and deportees have begun to </p><p>return." </p><p>RJONES </p><p></p></div>
