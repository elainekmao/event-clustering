The April 4 and 6 editions of the pro-government </p><p>      daily "The Daily Mirror" and its sister weekly "The </p><p>      Sunday Mirror," respectively, dedicated editorial </p><p>      space to comment on the significance of the DRC peace </p><p>      agreement signed in South Africa last week.  Editorial </p><p>      excerpts follow: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   Under headline "Allow peace to prevail in the </p><p>      DRC" the pro-government daily "The Daily Mirror" </p><p>      (04/04) comments: </p><p> </p><p>       "The historic signing of a peace agreement </p><p>     this week by warring parties in the DRC should </p><p>     usher the country. . .into an era of peace, </p><p>     reconciliation and reconstruction. . .  What </p><p>     makes the peace deal more promising. . .is that </p><p>     the agreement addresses the concerns and needs of </p><p>     all parties to the conflict. . .  Concerted </p><p>     efforts should be made to pressure Rwanda not to </p><p>     disturb the peace in the DRC. . .  Rwanda should </p><p>     learn to respect the sovereignty of other </p><p>     nations. . .  The Congolese people should </p><p>     remember that, their destiny and that of their </p><p>     country, is in their own hands." </p><p> </p><p>  3.   Under headline "DRC adopts new Constitution" the </p><p>      pro-government weekly "The Sunday Mirror" (04/06) </p><p>      comments: </p><p> </p><p>      "President Joseph Kabila has ratified a </p><p>      transitional constitution that is part of a </p><p>      power-sharing agreement with rebels intended to </p><p>      end four and half years of civil war.  By </p><p>      giving his presidential assent to the </p><p>      constitution, Kabila has committed himself to a </p><p>      transitional government expected to bring </p><p>      insurgent leaders from their far-flung </p><p>      strongholds to Congo\'s capital, Kinshasa.  The </p><p>      ratification has extinguished simmering doubts </p><p>      over the prospects of a genuine peaceful </p><p>      settlement to the Congo crisis that had been </p><p>      fueled by Kabila\'s absence from the signing </p><p>      ceremony of the peace deal in Sun City, South </p><p>      Africa, on Wednesday last week. . ." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
