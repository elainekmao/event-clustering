<p>S E C R E T ANKARA 001158 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EUR/SE, EB/ESC/ESP AND S/CT </p><p>TREASURY FOR GENERAL COUNSEL (DAVID AUFHAUSER) AND </p><p>TASK FORCE ON TERRORIST FINACING </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/02/2006 </p><p>TAGS: ETTC, EFIN, PTER, CVIS, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TERRORIST FINANCE:  INITIAL TURKISH RESPONSE ON </p><p>CHECHENS, HEKMATYAR, ANSAR AL-ISLAM, LASHKAR </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. SECSTATE 46849 </p><p>     B. SECSTATE 44222 </p><p>     C. SECSTATE 39386 </p><p>     D. SECSTATE 26891 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Economic Counselor Scot Marciel for reasons </p><p>1.5 (b), (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S) On February 18 and 21, MFA Department Head for </p><p>Intelligence and Research Nihat Ersen and MFA </p><p>counter-terrorism officer Firat Sunel responded to our </p><p>demarches on four terrorist asset freeze requests (reftels). </p><p> Two of the four involved pre-notifications of upcoming UN </p><p>designations (Chechen groups and Ansar al-Islam), and we </p><p>stressed the  need to act quickly on both requests. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S) Ersen and Sunel said the names on the four demarches </p><p>would be circulated interagency to GOT intelligence agencies, </p><p>Treasury, banking regulatory board and Central Bank to </p><p>research possible financial links to Turkey.  If there were </p><p>any assets under these names in Turkey, they would be blocked </p><p>informally.  However, formal, legal blocking of assets </p><p>required a Council of Ministers decree, and GOT practice was </p><p>to include names on such decrees only after they have been </p><p>designated by the UN Counter-Terrorism Committee.  The MFA </p><p>was now preparing a draft decree and would include on it </p><p>about 20 names recently designated by the UN (including </p><p>Laashkar i Jhangvi). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  Sunel updated us on the reaction to the last Council </p><p>of Ministers decree, issued in October 2002, which included </p><p>the Nasreddin Holding company in Istanbul.   This company\'s </p><p>assets had been blocked, and Sunel said he would find out the </p><p>dollar amount involved and inform us.  The MFA had recently </p><p>received a letter from the company\'s Turkish lawyers </p><p>threatening a lawsuit if the assets were not unblocked. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
