<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 TEGUCIGALPA 002934 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR DS/DSS/ITA </p><p>DS/OP/WHA FROM EAC </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/23/2012 </p><p>TAGS: ASEC, HO, PTER </p><p>SUBJECT: SECURITY ENVIRONMENT PROFILE QUESTIONNAIRE (SEPQ) </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. 02 SECSTATE 151188 </p><p>     B. 02 TEGUCIGALPA 00989 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Deputy Chief of Mission Roger Pierce, Reason 1.5 (C) </p><p>and (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.

(SBU)  Demonstrations:  Responses keyed to REFTEL </p><p>question paragraphs. </p><p> </p><p>(1-A.)  Yes.  Indigenous groups such as the civic council of </p><p>popular indigenous organizations (COPIN) and Council of </p><p>Peasant Organizations of Honduras (COCOCH) have carried out </p><p>anti-American demonstrations against U.S. foreign policy </p><p>initiatives and military presence.  Additionally there is a </p><p>Mosque in San Pedro Sula (approximately 3 1/2 hours North of </p><p>Tegucigalpa).  There is a large concentration of persons of </p><p>Arab decent (although most Honduran Arabs are Christian and </p><p>pro-American) in San Pedro Sula and La Ceiba (a town along </p><p>the North Coast).  It was reported that after the terrorist </p><p>attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon there were </p><p>small celebrations in each city (NFI). </p><p> </p><p>(1-B.)  No. </p><p> </p><p>(1-C.)  N/A. </p><p> </p><p>(1-D.)  Usually less than 100 people.  In April of 1998 an </p><p>estimated 220 protesters from COCOCH demonstrated in front of </p><p>the Embassy compound. </p><p> </p><p>(1-E.)  Yes.  Demonstrations are triggered by U.S. foreign </p><p>policy initiatives, past perceived human rights violations, </p><p>military action, and the U.S. presence in Honduras (i.e., </p><p>U.S. Military presence at Soto Cano Air Base).  Note: Most </p><p>Anti-US activity is inspired by a handful of demonstrators, </p><p>sometimes within larger demos passing by the Embassy in route </p><p>to other venues that take the opportunity to be photographed </p><p>by newspapers/media.  Demonstrators sometimes conduct </p><p>protests on domestic issues in front of the Embassy to </p><p>maximize local news coverage. </p><p> </p><p>(1-F.)  Peaceful. </p><p> </p><p>(1-G.)

(SBU)  Other Indigenous Terrorist Groups:  Responses to </p><p>paragraph 5. </p><p> </p><p>(5-A.)  No. </p><p> </p><p>(5-B.)  N/A. </p><p> </p><p>(5-C.)  N/A. </p><p> </p><p>(5-D.)

No.  However, there are rumors that there are Basque </p><p>Fatherland and Liberty (ETA), IRA, and Chiapas(Zapatistas) </p><p>sympathizers in Honduras who could be involved in advising </p><p>indigenous groups.  Some Hondurans are studying in Cuba and </p><p>also conceivably could be receiving training in subversion </p><p>and terrorism, although it is more likely they are being </p><p>indoctrinated as agents of influence.   As this Cuban program </p><p>for Hondurans is in its infancy, there have been no </p><p>indications that such training is taking place. </p><p> </p><p>(6-B.)  N/A. </p><p> </p><p>(6-C.)  N/A. </p><p> </p><p>(6-D.)  N/A and NO; however, there was one sensitive report </p><p>that 1-2 individuals, formerly from a European group may have </p><p>been hiding in Honduras and possibly working with unwitting </p><p>individuals.  They reportedly have departed the country, NFI. </p><p> </p><p>(6-E.)  N/A. </p><p> </p><p>(6-F.)  The only known hostile intelligence presence of note </p><p>is Cuban.  While the Cuban mission appears to have extensive </p><p>contacts with leftists and indigenous groups, there is no </p><p>indication they are planning or supporting terrorism. </p><p> </p><p>(6-G.)  There is no shortage of weapons in Honduras.  It </p><p>would also not be difficult for hostile terrorist elements to </p><p>import weapons and/or explosives from neighboring countries. </p><p>PALMER </p><p></p></div>
