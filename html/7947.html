<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 JAKARTA 005111 </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR HADLEY, MORIARTY, BROOKS </p><p>STATE FOR DEPUTY SECRETARY, EAP </p><p>SECDEF FOR DEPUTY SECRETARY WOLFOWITZ </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/09/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, PGOV, ID </p><p>SUBJECT: ACEH: YUDHOYONO HOPES FOR "INVISIBLE HAND OF GOD" </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) CLASSIFIED BY POLITICAL OFFICER TED LYNG FOR REASONS </p><p>1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) SUMMARY. MINISTER YUDHOYONO TOLD THE AMBASSADOR MAY 9 </p><p>THAT HE HOPED FOR THE "INVISIBLE HAND OF GOD" TO SAVE THE </p><p>ACEH PEACE PROCESS.  YUDHOYONO SAID THE WINDOW IS STILL OPEN </p><p>FOR DIALOGUE AND HE PRAYS FOR A BREAKTHROUGH.  THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>LOBBIED YUDHOYONO TO POSTPONE THE WITHDRAWAL OF INTERNATIONAL </p><p>MONITORS AND TO RECONSIDER THE ARREST OF THREE GAM JOINT </p><p>SECURITY COMMITTEE (JSC) NEGOTIATORS.  YUDHOYONO\'S REMARKS </p><p>ARE ENCOURAGING BUT, SHORT OF GAM\'S CAPITULATION, WE VIEW A </p><p>RENEWED MILITARY OFFENSIVE AS NEARLY INEVITABLE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>HAND OF GOD? </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) COORDINATING MINISTER FOR POLITICAL AND SECURITY </p><p>AFFAIRS SUSILO BAMBANG YUDHOYONO TOLD THE AMBASSADOR MAY 9 </p><p>THAT HE HOPED FOR "AN INVISIBLE HAND OF GOD" TO SAVE THE ACEH </p><p>PEACE PROCESS.  YUDHOYONO SAID THAT THE WINDOW FOR A </p><p>NEGOTIATED SOLUTION REMAINED OPEN.  HE NOTED THAT PRESIDENT </p><p>MEGAWATI HAD ENDORSED THE EFFORT OF A GROUP OF ACEHNESE </p><p>PARLIAMENTARIANS TO LOBBY GAM TO BE FLEXIBLE.  YUDHOYONO </p><p>INFERRED FROM THE PRESIDENT\'S ENDORSEMENT OF THIS EFFORT THAT </p><p>THERE WAS STILL A POSSIBILITY THAT RENEWED MILITARY </p><p>OPERATIONS COULD BE AVOIDED.  YUDHOYONO SAID HE PRAYED FOR A </p><p>BREAKTHROUGH. </p><p> </p><p>YUDHOYONO PUSHES ZINNI MISSION </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) YUDHOYONO TOLD THE AMBASSADOR THAT HE HAD PRAISED THE </p><p>ZINNI MISSION TO STOCKHOLM WITH PRESIDENT MEGAWATI.  HE WENT </p><p>ON TO TELL HER THE AMBASSADOR THAT THE U.S., JAPAN AND EU </p><p>HAVE "ALWAYS BEEN THERE FOR INDONESIA."  HE DID NOT DESCRIBE </p><p>MEGAWATI\'S REACTION. </p><p> </p><p>AMBASSADOR PRESSES ON WITHDRAWAL, ARRESTS </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) THE AMBASSADOR NOTED THE CONFLICTING SIGNALS THAT THE </p><p>CENTRE FOR HUMANITARIAN DIALOGUE (HDC), WHICH HAS BEEN </p><p>BROKERING THE ACEH PEACE AGREEMENT, WAS RECEIVING ABOUT THE </p><p>WITHDRAWAL OF JSC INTERNATIONAL MONITORS.  YUDHOYONO SAID HIS </p><p>OFFICE WAS PREPARING A LETTER INSTRUCTING HDC TO WITHDRAW ALL </p><p>INTERNATIONAL STAFF ON SUNDAY, MAY 11.  THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>PRESSED YUDHOYONO TO POSTPONE THE WITHDRAWAL UNTIL THE </p><p>RESULTS OF THE ZINNI MISSION COULD BE ABSORBED, STRESSING </p><p>THAT EVEN THE GOI\'S OWN DEADLINE EXTENDED UNTIL MAY 12. </p><p>YUDHOYONO REPLIED THAT THE AMBASSADOR\'S REQUEST SEEMED QUITE </p><p>REASONABLE AND PROMISED TO SEE WHAT COULD BE DONE TO </p><p>ACCOMMODATE IT.  YUDHOYONO ADDED THAT HDC STAFF NOT PART OF </p><p>THE FORMAL JSC STRUCTURE COULD STAY "FOR A FEW DAYS" OR MAYBE </p><p>LONGER.  (NOTE:  WE LATER RECEIVED A REPORT THAT YUDHOYONO\'S </p><p>OFFICE IN FACT SENT THE LETTER INSTRUCTING HDC TO WITHDRAW ON </p><p>SUNDAY.  AS OF 1930 THE SITUATION WAS STILL UNCLEAR.  END </p><p>NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) THE AMBASSADOR ASKED THE COORDINATING MINISTER IF HE </p><p>WAS AWARE OF THE MAY 9 ARRESTS OF THREE OF FIVE GAM </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES TO THE JSC\'S BANDA ACEH HEADQUARTERS, TEUNGKU </p><p>KAMARRUZAMAN, AMRI, AND AMNI.  YUDHOYONO ACKNOWLEDGED THE </p><p>ARRESTS AND NOTED THAT THE THREE MAY HAVE BEEN ATTEMPTING TO </p><p>DEPART INDONESIA WITHOUT THE PROPER DOCUMENTATION.  THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR REMINDED YUDHOYONO THAT THE COHA REMAINED IN </p><p>EFFECT AND THAT DETAINING THE THREE WOULD SEND A NEGATIVE </p><p>SIGNAL TO THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.  THE AMBASSADOR URGED </p><p>THE GOI TO RELEASE THREE ARRESTED GAM MEMBERS.  YUDHOYONO </p><p>SAID THAT HE WOULD LOOK INTO THE MATTER AND ENSURE THE THREE </p><p>WERE TREATED STRICTLY ACCORDING TO LAW. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT: DIVINE INTERVENTION? </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) THOUGH YUDHOYONO\'S PRAYERS FOR DIVINE INTERVENTION ARE </p><p>HEARTWARMING AND NO DOUBT GENUINE, THIS MAY BE A CASE OF </p><p>ACEH\'S BEING TOO FAR FROM GOD AND TOO CLOSE TO INDONESIA.  WE </p><p>STILL REGARD A MILITARY OFFENSIVE AS NEARLY INEVITABLE.  ONLY </p><p>A DRAMATIC GESTURE BY THE GAM TO ACCEPT SPECIAL AUTONOMY AND </p><p>TURN IN ITS WEAPONS ON JAKARTA\'S TERMS, WHICH APPEARS </p><p>UNLIKELY, COULD FORESTALL THE GOI\'S RETURN TO A MILITARY </p><p>OPERATION IN ACEH.  THAT BEING SAID, WHEN THE STAKES ARE THIS </p><p>HIGH, LONG SHOTS ARE WORTH PURSUING, ESPECIALLY IF HEAVEN MAY </p><p>LEND A HAND. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BOYCE </p><p></p></div>
