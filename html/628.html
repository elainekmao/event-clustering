THE MEETING TOOK PLACE IN A MUNICIPAL </p><p>BUILDING AT THE BOROVO FACTORY OUTSIDE VUKOVAR. </p><p>AMBASSADOR ALBRIGHT AND ASSISTANT SECRETARY SHATTUCK </p><p>AND THEIR PARTY ALSO ATTENDED THE MEETING, BUT DID </p><p>NOT PARTICIPATE.  EMBASSY CON/POL OFFICER WAS </p><p>NOTETAKER.  THE MEETING WAS AGREED TO AFTER THE LOCAL </p><p>SERBS THREATENED TO OBSTRUCT THE VISIT OF THE </p><p>ALBRIGHT PARTY TO THE OVCARA GRAVE SITE UNLESS THEY </p><p>HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO MEET THE GROUP.  THE BRIEF </p><p>MEETING FOLLOWED THE VISIT TO THE GRAVE SITE. </p><p>(NOTE:  OVCARA IS SAID TO BE THE SITE OF A MASS GRAVE </p><p>WHERE THE BODIES OF UP TO THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE TAKEN </p><p>BY THE SERBS FROM THE VUKOVAR HOSPITAL ARE BURIED. </p><p>END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>2.

THE SERBS ARE BLAMED FOR </p><p>EVERYTHING, HE SAID, EVEN THE DESTRUCTION OF THE OLD </p><p>BRIDGE IN MOSTAR.  IT IS NOT TRUE, HE ADDED, THAT </p><p>EVERYTHING THE SERBS DO IS BAD AND EVERYTHING THE </p><p>CROATS DO IS GOOD, "JUST AS IT WOULD BE A LIE IF I </p><p>TOLD YOU EVERYTHING THE SERBS DID WAS GOOD." HADZIC </p><p>SAID THE SERBS HAD FOUGHT TO DEFEND THEIR HOMES AFTER </p><p>THE WAR WAS STARTED BY CROATS WHO KILLED OR SET FIRE </p><p>TO EVERYTHING WHICH BELONGED TO THE SERBS.  HE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00157  01 OF 02  121835Z </p><p>CONCLUDED BY SEEKING THE GROUPS\' OBSERVATIONS HAVING </p><p>JUST VISITED THE OVCARA GRAVE SITE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  AMBASSADOR GALBRAITH RESPONDED THAT, AS </p><p>"AMBASSADOR TO THIS COUNTRY," HE WANTED TO EXPRESS </p><p>THE UNITED STATES\' COMMITMENT TO HUMAN RIGHTS FOR </p><p>"ALL OF THE PEOPLES OF FORMER YUGOSLAVIA."  NOTING </p><p>THAT THE OVCARA SITE HAD MADE A STRONG IMPRESSION ON </p><p>ALL MEMBERS OF THE GROUP, HE EXPRESSED THE </p><p>DETERMINATION OF THE U.S. THAT THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR </p><p>WAR CRIMES "ON ALL SIDES" WILL BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. </p><p>HE THEN DETAILED U.S. POLICY TOWARDS THE REGION, </p><p>SPECIFICALLY NOTING OUR SUPPORT FOR THE TERRITORIAL </p><p>INTEGRITY OF CROATIA AND THE DEMAND THAT THE HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS OF ALL GROUPS, INCLUDING THE SERBIAN </p><p>COMMUNITY, BE PROTECTED "IN FACT AS WELL AS IN LAW." </p><p> </p><p>4.  HADZIC REPLIED THAT HE UNDERSTOOD THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR\'S "SINCERE WISH FOR PEACE," BUT THAT IT </p><p>WAS CLEAR "YOU ARE NOT AWARE OF CERTAIN FACTS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  00157  02 OF 02  121835Z </p><p>ACTION SS-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-01   CIAE-00  C-01     OASY-00  DOEE-00  EB-01 </p><p>      EUR-01   HA-09    H-01     IMMC-01  TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-16 </p><p>      L-01     ADS-00   NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   PA-01    PM-01 </p><p>      PRS-01   P-01     RPCS-01  SCT-03   SIL-00   SNP-00   SP-00 </p><p>      SR-00    SSO-00   STR-01   TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00  RPE-01 </p><p>      SNIS-00  NISC-02    /047W </p><p>                  ------------------19675D  121836Z /38 </p><p>P 121921Z JAN 94 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 0487 </p><p>INFO CINCUSAFE RAMSTEIN AB GE//DO/LG/XP/IN/POLAD// </p><p>CINCUSAREUR HEIDELBERG GE//J3/J4/J5/POLAD// </p><p>497IG AMHS BOLLING AFB DC//INAGE// </p><p>HQ JTF PP NAPLES IT//CA/POLAD// </p><p>JOINT STAFF WASHDC//J5-PMA/J21// </p><p>SECDEF WASHDC//ISA/ISP// </p><p>CINCUSNAVEUR LONDON UK//N2/N22// </p><p>COM SIXTHFLT//N2// </p><p>USEC BRUSSELS </p><p>AMEMBASSY VIENNA </p><p>AMEMBASSY WARSAW </p><p>AMEMBASSY TIRANA </p><p>AMEMBASSY THE HAGUE </p><p>AMEMBASSY SOFIA </p><p>AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>USEUCOM VAIHINGEN GE//ECJ3/ECJ4/ECJ5/ECPOLAD// </p><p>AMEMBASSY PRAGUE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00157  02 OF 02  121835Z </p><p>AMEMBASSY PARIS </p><p>AMEMBASSY MOSCOW </p><p>AMEMBASSY LONDON </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p>AMEMBASSY LJUBLJANA </p><p>AMEMBASSY BUCHAREST </p><p>WHITE HOUSE WASHDC </p><p>AMEMBASSY BUDAPEST </p><p>AMEMBASSY BRUSSELS </p><p>AMEMBASSY BONN </p><p>AMEMBASSY BELGRADE </p><p>AMEMBASSY ATHENS </p><p>AMEMBASSY ANKARA </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 ZAGREB 000157 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EUR/EE AND HA </p><p>VIENNA ALSO FOR EMBASSY BOSNIA </p><p>LJUBLJANA PLEASE PASS TO AMB.

HE THEN </p><p>CATALOGED THE SERBS\' HISTORICAL GRIEVANCES AND LAID </p><p>BLAME FOR THE WAR ON THE CROATS.  REGARDING WAR </p><p>CRIMES, HADZIC COMPLAINED THAT WAR CRIMES IN VIETNAM, </p><p>CAMBODIA, AND ARGENTINA HAD NEVER BEEN PUNISHED AND </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00157  02 OF 02  121835Z </p><p>ASKED WHY ATTENTION WAS FOCUSED ON CRIMES IN THE </p><p>FORMER YUGOSLAVIA?  HE ADDED, HOWEVER, THAT HE WAS </p><p>WILLING TO SEE SERB CRIMINALS FACE THE TRIBUNAL AND </p><p>EVEN UNDERSTOOD THAT SERBS MAY NEED TO BE THE FIRST </p><p>TRIED, "BUT NOT ONLY SERBS SHOULD BE TRIED." </p><p> </p><p>5.  MILAN ILIC, HEAD OF THE REGIONAL COUNCIL THEN </p><p>DELIVERED A SPEECH FULL OF BOMBAST, COMPLETE WITH </p><p>QUOTATIONS FROM MARX (AND ELIHU ROOT), WHILE </p><p>WAVING IN THE AIR BOOKS ALLEGEDLY PROVING CROATIAN </p><p>GUILT FOR THE WAR.  HE STATED FIRMLY THAT SERBS WOULD </p><p>NEVER ACCEPT BEING PART OF CROATIA AGAIN BECAUSE </p><p>"THAT WOULD MEAN THE END OF SERBS\' EXISTENCE." </p><p> </p><p>6.  ASKED ABOUT THE RETURN OF DISPLACED PERSONS TO </p><p>THEIR HOMES IN THE KRAJINA, HADZIC SAID THAT THOSE </p><p>NOT GUILTY OF WAR CRIMES (ADDING "WHILE MOST CROATS </p><p>ARE, A FEW ARE NOT") CAN RETURN AS SOON AS THEY </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGE THE KRAJINA\'S SOVEREIGNTY AND BECOME </p><p>"RSK" CITIZENS.  HADZIC QUIPPED THAT U.S. AND RSK </p><p>POLICIES WERE NEARLY IDENTICAL, SINCE THE KRAJINA </p><p>ALSO SUPPORTS CROATIA\'S TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY "WITHIN </p><p>ITS CURRENT BOUNDARIES." </p><p> </p><p>7.  CONCLUDING THE MEETING, AMBASSADOR GALBRAITH SAID </p><p>THAT HE FELT IT COULD MARK THE BEGINNING OF A </p><p>DIALOGUE WITH THE SERBIAN COMMUNITY IN THE KRAJINA. </p><p> </p><p>8.  NOTE:  ON JANUARY 11, THE EMBASSY ASKED UNPROFOR </p><p>TO ARRANGE A VISIT TO SECTOR EAST FOR A CONGRESSIONAL </p><p>STAFF DELEGATION.  WHEN UNPROFOR WENT TO THE "KRAJINA </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00157  02 OF 02  121835Z </p><p>REGIONAL COUNCIL" TO "INFORM THEM OF THE VISIT" -- </p><p>I.E., ASK THEIR PERMISSION -- THE SERB\'S ANSWERED </p><p>WITH A FLAT NO.  UNPROFOR ARGUED THAT THIS WAS DUE TO </p><p>ANXIETY AMONG LOCAL LEADERS IN THE BUILD-UP TO THE </p><p>FINAL ROUND OF KRAJINA ELECTIONS.  BUT THEY ALSO </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE SERBS WERE NOT PLEASED THAT </p><p>THEIR MEETING WITH AMBASSADOR GALBRAITH HAD FAILED TO </p><p>CONFER ON THEM ANY INTERNATIONAL LEGITIMACY OR ANY </p><p>PERCEPTIBLE IMPROVEMENT IN THEIR IMAGE.  END NOTE. </p><p> </p><p>GALBRAITH </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p></p></div>
