(C) ACCORDING TO PATRIOTIC UNION OF KURDISTAN (PUK) </p><p>ANKARA REP BAHROS GALALI, ON MAY 30 A SPLIT IN THE ISLAMIC </p><p>UNION MOVEMENT OF KURDISTAN (IUMK) RESULTED IN MULLAH ALI </p><p>BAPIR FOUNDING HIS OWN GROUP WHICH HE HAS NAMED THE ISLAMIC </p><p>JIHAD PARTY.  BAPIR IS A RIVAL OF IUKM LEADER MULLAH ALI </p><p>ABDULAZIZ.  BOTH LEADERS ARE BASED IN THE HALABJA DISTRICT, </p><p>HAVE ARMED MILITIA UNDER THEIR COMMAND AND RECEIVE SUPPORT </p><p>FROM IRAN.  WHILE THE HALABJA DISTRICT HAS FOR SOME TIME </p><p>BEEN CONTROLLED BY THE IUMK, ACCORDING TO GALALI, ISLAMIC </p><p>JIHAD ON THE NIGHT OF MAY 30 SUCCEEDED IN TAKING THE </p><p>VILLAGES OF KURMAL AND ANAB WITHOUT A FIGHT.  GALALI </p><p>CONTACTED US WITH THIS INFORMATION ON MAY 31 ON PUK LEADER </p><p>JALAL TALABANI\'S INSTRUCTION. </p><p> </p><p>2.(C) THE PUK IS CONCERNED THAT THE ISLAMIST SPLIT AND GRAB </p><p>OF TERRITORY MAY LEAD TO FIGHTING BETWEEN THE ARMED RIVAL </p><p>FACTIONS, THOUGH NONE IS YET REPORTED.

IN A FURTHER </p><p>COMPLICATION FOR THE PUK, TWO PUK "MINISTERS" AND TWO </p><p>"DEPUTY MINISTERS" ARE ISLAMISTS FROM THE IUMK AND IT IS </p><p>NOT CLEAR WITH WHICH FACTION THEY WILL ALIGN THEMSELVES. </p><p> </p><p>3.
