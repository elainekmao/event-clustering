STATE 22225, B. 02 ABUJA 02976, C. ABUJA 00159 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  The following is post\'s submission for the annual </p><p>Trafficking in Persons (TIP) report.  Paragraphs below are </p><p>keyed to questions in reftel.  Note: Post tried to confine </p><p>material to respective sections, but several examples have </p><p>overlapping relevance to the general overview, prevention, </p><p>prosecution, and protection questions.  Details in each </p><p>section have shared relevance with the others and are best </p><p>reviewed as a whole. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  OVERVIEW OF A COUNTRY\'S ACTIVITIES TO ELIMINATE </p><p>TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A and B.  Nigeria is a country of origin, transit, and </p><p>destination for international trafficked men, women, and </p><p>children.  Nigeria is primarily a point of origin, though it </p><p>also serves as a significant transit area for trafficking in </p><p>the sub-region.  To a lesser extent it is a destination </p><p>point for young children from nearby West African countries. </p><p>There is also a sizeable, but unquantifiable, internal </p><p>trafficking network for forced labor and commercial sexual </p><p>exploitation (CSE) within Nigeria.  While the majority of </p><p>trafficking from Nigeria involves females destined for </p><p>brothels in Southern Europe, estimated thousands of young </p><p>males are trafficked to other African countries, including </p><p>Gabon, Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, Cote d\'Ivoire and the </p><p>Benin Republic, to work on farms or plantations.  Some </p><p>children are coerced into prostitution.  Press reports claim </p><p>18 children per month are repatriated from Gabon to </p><p>Nigeria\'s eastern cities.  Authorities have identified </p><p>another trafficking route of children through Katsina and </p><p>Sokoto to the Middle East and East Africa.  This practice </p><p>reflects historic slave trade routes between Sub-Saharan </p><p>Africa and the Middle East.  Eastern Nigeria and Cross River </p><p>and Akwa Ibom states have been the focus of trafficking of </p><p>children for labor and, reportedly in some cases, human </p><p>sacrifice.  Many children are sold for as little as $50.00, </p><p>according to press sources.  There were credible reports in </p><p>2002 that poor families sold their daughters into marriage </p><p>as a means of supplementing their income.  Traffickers </p><p>profited USD 50 to 1,500 or more per child, depending on the </p><p>child\'s earnings. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sources of information regarding Nigerian involvement in the </p><p>international sex trade, the largest "employer" of Nigerian </p><p>trafficking victims, include press, government officials, </p><p>NGOs, victims, transportation company personnel, law </p><p>enforcement authorities, international aid agencies and </p><p>diplomatic missions.  The UN International Office of </p><p>Migration (IOM) estimates that as many as 300,000 Nigerian </p><p>women were trafficked for CSE since 1997.  In May 2002, </p><p>Minister of State Musa Elayo said that between 3,000 and </p><p>4,000 Nigerian trafficking victims are repatriated annually </p><p>and called for passage of the National Assembly\'s anti-TIP </p><p>bill. The Italian Ambassador to Nigeria recently estimated </p><p>that 18,000 Nigerians prostitutes currently in Italy were </p><p>trafficking victims.  Nigeria and Italy signed and are </p><p>implementing a bilateral agreement to protect and repatriate </p><p>victims.  In the past four years, Italy and Nigeria have </p><p>cooperated to repatriate over 1,500 such victims.  In June </p><p>2002, 200 victims were deported to Nigeria.  On average now, </p><p>there are about 50 women deported to Nigeria per week. </p><p>While many had gone willingly to Italy, others were forced </p><p>or duped by family members or criminal gangs or driven by </p><p>dire economic conditions into the international sex </p><p>industry.  Some believed they were going to work as </p><p>waitresses or domestic staff, and were forced into </p><p>prostitution in order to pay off the debt of being </p><p>trafficked internationally.  Other significant receiving </p><p>countries for trafficked Nigerians include the Netherlands, </p><p>Spain and France.  In one glaring example, in 1999 a Dutch </p><p>court convicted the former Ambassador of the Netherlands to </p><p>Nigeria for providing visas to Nigerian women allegedly to </p><p>engage in the commercial sex trade. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>C.  As in the 2002 report, fewer trafficking syndicates </p><p>appear to be trafficking females to Europe via air routes. </p><p>Instead, some are opting for the more circuitous but less </p><p>scrutinized land routes across West Africa and the Sahara. </p><p>This change appears to be caused by improved interdiction </p><p>efforts by airlines, European diplomatic missions in </p><p>Nigeria, and immigration authorities at European airports. </p><p>The adoption of Shari\'a-based legal systems by northern </p><p>states resulted in the stronger enforcement of laws against </p><p>child prostitution there.  However, NGOs and journalists </p><p>have reported that Koranic scholars in the north are </p><p>exploiting child labor, and many children are reportedly </p><p>being trafficked to Saudi Arabia during the Hajj. </p><p>Immigration estimates it sees about 20 cases of trafficking </p><p>per month. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>D.  The extent and nature of trafficking in Nigeria has been </p><p>studied and reported on by various sources listed above.  As </p><p>stated last year, the ILO\'s International Program for the </p><p>Elimination of Child Labor (IPEC) has conducted a regional </p><p>study of child trafficking patterns in eight West African </p><p>countries.  This excellent resource, part of a $4.3 million </p><p>regional anti-trafficking project funded by USDOL, is </p><p>available on the Internet at www.ilo.org.  Recent USAID and </p><p>DOL studies based on surveys carried out by the </p><p>International Institute of Tropical Agriculture explore </p><p>Nigerian child labor in the cocoa industry.  A similar study </p><p>produced by UNICEF (available at www.unicef.org) also </p><p>provides quality information.  In 2001 UNICEF published a </p><p>report called "Children\'s and Women\'s Rights in Nigeria: A </p><p>Wake-up Call" (not available on the Web site).  The </p><p>International Organization of Migration (IOM) funded a study </p><p>by the University of Benin (Edo State, Nigeria) to ascertain </p><p>the extent of the problem in Nigeria, but the report remains </p><p>unpublished to date.  When released, this report may contain </p><p>the most comprehensive data on trafficking within the </p><p>country. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.  Most victims trafficked to Nigeria are young children </p><p>from neighboring states, including Togo and Benin Republic. </p><p>Thousands of children are also trafficked domestically. </p><p>Girls are usually placed in homes as domestic servants; most </p><p>boys become agricultural laborers.  Some of the children </p><p>involved in this trade are incorporated into households, </p><p>working as "wards."  A smaller number may be used to hawk </p><p>goods on street corners or to beg.  Traffickers take </p><p>advantage of a cultural tradition of "fostering," under </p><p>which it is acceptable to send a child to live and work with </p><p>a more prosperous family in an urban center in return for </p><p>educational and vocational advancement.  Often the children </p><p>in these situations only work and do not receive any formal </p><p>education; however, many families who employ children as </p><p>domestic servants also pay their school fees.  Other </p><p>children are forced to hawk goods for their parents or </p><p>guardians, selling nuts, fruits, and other items in the </p><p>streets, at times amidst heavy traffic.  Fear of physical </p><p>punishment, language barriers, and traditional religious </p><p>practices are used to control victims.  Child workers also </p><p>fear the deadly poverty that may befall a parent or other </p><p>family member if he or she does not earn a living.  In </p><p>countries such as Nigeria where many practice animism, the </p><p>belief in "juju" curses and oaths has considerable effect on </p><p>silencing children in forced labor. Ref B discusses child </p><p>labor conditions further. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>F.  Traffickers target impoverished families in rural areas </p><p>for child trafficking from Nigeria, particularly in Cross </p><p>River, Akwa Ibom, Imo, Abia, and Ebonyi states.  Some </p><p>children are trafficked for labor in Cameroon, Gabon, Benin </p><p>Republic, and Equatorial Guinea to work in agricultural </p><p>enterprises or as market traders.  (These children are also </p><p>targeted for domestic trafficking as domestic servants in </p><p>Abuja and Lagos.)  Nigeria\'s ministry of women\'s affairs </p><p>estimates some 6,000 Nigerian children between ages 6 and 13 </p><p>are enslaved as farmhands and domestic servants in West </p><p>Africa.  Some traffickers kidnapped children from school </p><p>grounds; at least one such example was rescued by a family </p><p>and returned to his family. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Traffickers may be a distant relative or a friend of a </p><p>friend, often called a "sponsor" or an "aunty," who </p><p>approaches poor parents with promises of a better life for </p><p>their child international or domestically in the home of a </p><p>wealthy urban family.  Parents, ignorant of the conditions </p><p>awaiting their child, often agree in exchange for a small </p><p>sum or the promise of salary remittance.  Traffickers have </p><p>also reportedly tried to have children in juvenile courts </p><p>released to their custody, which has aroused the suspicions </p><p>of a few alert magistrates in local courts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Children are sometimes trafficked through southeastern </p><p>Nigeria through the riverine areas at night by small boats, </p><p>locally referred to as "Ijaw Airways" (Ijaw and Itsekiri are </p><p>reportedly common conductors of these passageways). </p><p>Children are packed in boats or canoes and can spend days </p><p>without food or water on the high seas to reach </p><p>international destinations.  Some of these victims jump </p><p>overboard; others die in boat accidents; some are reportedly </p><p>shot by police upon arrival.  Documentation is not </p><p>necessarily used, but falsified passports or illegitimately- </p><p>issued genuine passports are also likely used (per </p><p>experience in the U.S. visa section of the mission).  In </p><p>Libreville, trafficked Igbo children are forced to hawk </p><p>goods in markets, endure beatings, and receive little or no </p><p>compensation.  Some child victims have grown to adulthood in </p><p>these conditions; despite their desire to return to their </p><p>native land, they cannot afford the exit visa fee and/or </p><p>fines for having been in Gabon illegally. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Traffickers mostly target young women for the </p><p>international sex trade, but some are also used as drug </p><p>couriers.  Edo is followed by Delta State as the main </p><p>suppliers of Nigerian prostitutes for Italy. Anecdotal </p><p>evidence suggests that Edo indigenes began migrating to </p><p>Italy to work as migrant farm laborers several decades ago. </p><p>These laborers began facilitating the travel of other Edo </p><p>residents to Italy for work.  Some of these individuals </p><p>became involved with drug trafficking and other criminal </p><p>activities.  In the 1980s and 1990s, Nigerian criminal </p><p>networks, primarily in Turin and Milan, began facilitating </p><p>travel of young women for prostitution. Ironically, many </p><p>traffickers are former victims who have paid off their </p><p>madams and begun recruiting girls from their home areas to </p><p>Italy.  Many traffickers prefer overland routes through </p><p>Benin, Togo and Ghana.  Some victims then fly from Accra or </p><p>Abidjan to Europe.  Others move overland to Conakry, then to </p><p>Bamako, then to Algiers or Casablanca for sail across the </p><p>Western Mediterranean to Spain.  Staying in safehouses along </p><p>the way, the overland route takes two to three weeks, and </p><p>many victims die of heat exhaustion in transit.  In </p><p>addition, Kano\'s international airport is becoming a new hub </p><p>for traffickers, given regular flight service from this </p><p>airport to destinations in eastern Africa and the Middle </p><p>East.  Victims are also being taken overland to Niger and </p><p>Morocco or driven through Egypt to the Middle East and </p><p>Europe. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Many young women claim they are told they will perform work </p><p>other than prostitution and then are forced into the sex </p><p>trade once abroad. Other young women know they will be in </p><p>the sex trade.  What most do not know are the horrendous </p><p>conditions they will encounter. A Madam may pay a trafficker </p><p>USD 12,000 per victim.  Many are not paid the salaries </p><p>promised, forced into indentured servitude to repay </p><p>smuggling fees as high as USD 50,000, and are subjected to </p><p>physical and sexual abuse to keep them from alerting foreign </p><p>law enforcement authorities.  The Madam may profit USD </p><p>20,000 to 50,000 per victim.  Traffickers often use family </p><p>pressure to ensure the victims\' participation.  Nigerian </p><p>crime syndicates may threaten or use indebtedness, beatings </p><p>and/or rape, physical injury to or even murder of the </p><p>victim\'s family members, arrest and deportation to persuade </p><p>those forced into a life of servitude from attempting to </p><p>escape.  Many trafficking victims are forced to undergo </p><p>ritual cultural oaths of secrecy or are swayed with charms. </p><p>Because belief in traditional religions is still maintained </p><p>by a number of Nigerians, even those practicing Christianity </p><p>or Islam, those juju rituals can keep many victims from </p><p>contacting authorities about their abuse.  See also section </p><p>H below. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>G.  Despite the significant efforts discussed throughout </p><p>this report, the GON has been unable to comply with the </p><p>minimum standards of the U.S. Trafficking Victims Protection </p><p>Act (TVPA).  In the past year, the Federal Government showed </p><p>no new commitment of resources to fighting TIP.  In June </p><p>2002, the House of Representatives passed a draft anti- </p><p>trafficking in persons bill.  The Senate passed the bill on </p><p>February 6, 2003, and it now awaits President Obasanjo\'s </p><p>signature into law. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>News reports alleged that the law would transform the Women </p><p>Trafficking and Child Labour Eradication Foundation </p><p>(WOTCLEF), an NGO founded by Amina Titi Atiku Abubakar, wife </p><p>of Vice President Atiku, into a federally funded and staffed </p><p>agency.  A source who testified at the Senate hearings on </p><p>the bill denies any such provision is included in the law. </p><p>On January 28, 2003, the House of Representatives ratified </p><p>the United Nations Protocol to Prevent, Suppress, and Punish </p><p>Trafficking in Persons.  On the same day, the House </p><p>rescinded its previous decision (on October 30, 2002) which </p><p>rejected the Child Rights Bill.  Public hearings on the bill </p><p>will review and reconsider the bill, whose sections setting </p><p>the minimum age for marriage at 18 are considered </p><p>"offensive" to some Nigerian customs.  Despite the delay in </p><p>passing this domestic law on child rights, Nigeria did </p><p>ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child in the </p><p>early 1990s. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Although various laws have proscribed child labor in Nigeria </p><p>continually since colonial times, in 2002 President Obasanjo </p><p>signed the instruments of ratification for ILO Convention </p><p>182, Worst Form of Child Labor, Convention 138, Minimum Age </p><p>for Employment, and Convention 111, Equality of Occupation. </p><p>President Obasanjo recognizes TIP as a threat to Nigeria and </p><p>remains personally committed to the issue, frequently </p><p>speaking out against it.  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs </p><p>has designated an office to handle TIP issues.  In 2002 the </p><p>Government established an inter-ministerial Committee to </p><p>Address TIP, but this committee lacked its own budget and </p><p>oversaw no programs.  Police and immigration have dedicated </p><p>TIP units.  The Police Anti-TIP Task Force of 10 officers in </p><p>Lagos was created by the GON in 1999 to assist with the </p><p>repatriation of trafficked victims and to build criminal </p><p>cases against suspected traffickers.  Other anti-TIP units </p><p>are located in eleven critical states, which the GON plans </p><p>to staff with 100 officers.  Government programs for health, </p><p>education and general social development, while not </p><p>earmarked to address trafficking per se, indirectly do help </p><p>address factors contributing to trafficking. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>H.  Post has received credible reports that individual </p><p>government officials facilitate trafficking via passive </p><p>complicity, lacking will to fight the problem, or by </p><p>actively condoning the practice.  Corruption is common in </p><p>Customs, the National Police Force and Immigration, where </p><p>most personnel are underpaid and poorly trained.  Some </p><p>repatriated TIP victims have alleged the active </p><p>participation of Nigerian Immigration officials as a part of </p><p>the trafficking syndicates.  Returnees have reported that </p><p>they boarded flights to Italy for a fee ($10,000 to $15,000) </p><p>without any passport or visa. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In November 2002, the GON announced its investigation of a </p><p>retired senior customs or immigration officer and two others </p><p>suspected of trafficking children in Abuja.  Post\'s last </p><p>information on this case showed the GON was searching for </p><p>the suspects.  Allegations against the former official were </p><p>made by an official in the Internal Affairs Ministry, who </p><p>said he had "heard children crying in the night at [the </p><p>suspects\' addresses], then you would hear the sound of a </p><p>vehicle going out of the premises and then you no longer </p><p>hear the cries."  Many women are reportedly trafficked </p><p>through neighboring countries using forged travel documents </p><p>identifying them as non-Nigerians.  Ghana and Guinea serve </p><p>as the main transit points using this method.  The arrest of </p><p>15 Nigerian traffickers and rescue of 33 Nigerian women and </p><p>girls in Conakry in 2001 revealed the major role Guinea </p><p>plays as a transit hub for Nigerian females bound for Europe </p><p>(please see section I under "INVESTIGATION AND PROSECUTION </p><p>OF TRAFFICKERS" for more information on this case.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>I.  The National Police Force, Customs, Immigration, and </p><p>other relevant authorities lack financial resources and a </p><p>sustained political commitment from the Federal Government </p><p>to combat trafficking in persons effectively.  Few officers </p><p>have been trained adequately to identify and monitor </p><p>traffickers.  A handful of notable crusaders in the police </p><p>force, mostly females, are personally committed to the issue </p><p>and effect the largest results. They regularly use their own </p><p>funds or resources to feed and care for deportees, or to pay </p><p>for travel to neighboring states for investigations.  Former </p><p>Deputy Inspector General (DIG) of Police Abimbola Ojomo and </p><p>Head of the Lagos-based task force against TIP, Mrs. D.A. </p><p>Gimba, demonstrate a personal commitment to fight </p><p>traffickers and aid victims.  Immigration comptrollers are </p><p>visiting state officials, local government authorities, and </p><p>traditional rulers to raise awareness of the issue. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Corruption, endemic in Nigerian society after decades of </p><p>misrule and mismanagement by military rulers, remains one of </p><p>the GON\'s most pressing problems.  The GON could summon </p><p>adequate resources to address the TIP problem, but to date </p><p>has chosen to allocate resources to other pressing, and </p><p>equally distressing, problems facing the country.  Reports </p><p>from air carriers suggest that most sex workers travel with </p><p>authentic documents.  False Nigerian documents can be </p><p>purchased cheaply and easily.  Italian documents, </p><p>particularly the residency permit, are extremely vulnerable </p><p>to fraud.  The GON has not demonstrated the ability nor the </p><p>will to curb fraud in the issuance of travel documents. </p><p>Therefore, the onus has fallen on Italian authorities to </p><p>control entry.  In 2002, the Italian and Nigerian </p><p>governments signed a repatriation agreement, but this does </p><p>not seem to address the problem of immigration fraud. </p><p>Police attempts to stem TIP were inadequate, and frequently </p><p>the victims were subjected to lengthy detention and public </p><p>humiliation upon repatriation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  PREVENTION: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A.  The GON acknowledges that trafficking is a problem and </p><p>is aware of the negative image that trafficking generates. </p><p>However, many GON officials put the responsibility for </p><p>addressing the international TIP problem on destination </p><p>countries, such as Italy.  Some officials and even NGOs </p><p>blame the problem on demand for Nigerian prostitutes in </p><p>Europe.  The trafficking of women and children from northern </p><p>Nigeria to Saudi Arabia is a growing problem, but officials </p><p>of these predominately Muslim states are reluctant to admit </p><p>the existence of a sex or labor trade to Muslim countries. </p><p>Nigerian Government officials also do not openly admit the </p><p>internal trafficking of children within Nigeria for forced </p><p>labor purposes. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>B.  In the past year, a number of Nigerian government </p><p>agencies became more involved in anti-trafficking efforts, </p><p>particularly at the state level.  Several governors and </p><p>their spouses have developed a personal interest in the </p><p>issue and begun holding state ministerial-level meetings, </p><p>including such state and local agencies as Women\'s Affairs, </p><p>Social Development, Police, Justice, Children\'s Affairs, </p><p>Juvenile Courts, and the Attorney General.  Among the most </p><p>active new examples are Governor and Mrs. Achike Udenwa in </p><p>Imo, Governor and Mrs. Peter Odili in Rivers, Governor and </p><p>Mrs. Victor Attah in Akwa Ibom, and Governor Orji Kalu in </p><p>Abia.  At the federal level, the main anti-TIP body is the </p><p>inter-ministerial committee to address TIP. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GON anti-trafficking efforts still focus largely on law </p><p>enforcement through Customs, Immigration, and the Nigerian </p><p>Police Force, including the Anti-TIP Task Force in Lagos. </p><p>In the past, police attempted to deter the trafficking of </p><p>women by imposing jail sentences and publicly humiliating </p><p>the victims.  In 1999, the federal Criminal Investigation </p><p>Department (CID) paraded a group of 47 females and 17 male </p><p>victims before the press in Lagos.  Later that year, 62 </p><p>undocumented women were deported from Italy to Nigeria and </p><p>met by police, local media, their parents and village </p><p>chiefs.  They were promptly arrested.  Such deportations </p><p>from Italy are common now, and the deportees are not </p><p>arrested but rather released after a cursory screening. </p><p>Both approaches to handling the deportees appear ineffective </p><p>as greed continues to motivate parents, relatives, and </p><p>traffickers in the sex industry.  The absence of punishment </p><p>for traffickers also encourages them to continue their </p><p>crimes.  One of the highest-risk groups for trafficking is </p><p>returned victims.  Former Deputy Inspector General Ojomo, </p><p>who has participated in several international trafficking </p><p>conferences, searches for sponsors for rehabilitation </p><p>programs for returned prostitutes to prevent their being re- </p><p>trafficked. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>C.  National public awareness campaigns undertaken by NGOs, </p><p>prominent politicians, state governments, presidential </p><p>statements, and the press are gaining widespread attention. </p><p>Public awareness of TIP increased with Nigerian </p><p>participation in trafficking for Commercial Sexual </p><p>Exploitation (CSE) in Europe and awareness of child </p><p>trafficking for forced labor is growing substantially.  As </p><p>discussed above, new legislation promises to raise the TIP </p><p>profile further.  WOTCLEF raises national awareness of the </p><p>trafficking problem through Titi Abubakar\'s high profile </p><p>involvement in the issue.  In 2001 WOTCLEF sponsored the </p><p>first Nigerian-hosted Pan-African conference on Human </p><p>Trafficking in Abuja. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Despite the capital-intensive nature of reaching the village </p><p>level (transportation requires rugged vehicles and hours of </p><p>slow plodding through dilapidated, ill-defined roads at </p><p>times overrun by vegetation), state level actors and making </p><p>significant headway in public awareness campaigns.  In 2002, </p><p>Imo State forged an innovation and comprehensive anti- </p><p>trafficking campaign through its Ministry of Women\'s Affairs </p><p>and Social Development.  This campaign includes radio </p><p>jingles in pidgin English and local tongues (warning parents </p><p>to "beware of people who come with shiny gifts"), handbills, </p><p>billboards, newsletters, public service announcements, </p><p>posters, a 5-episode television dramatization series, a </p><p>documentary, and on-site, intensive, public briefings by the </p><p>ministry in all Imo local governments. The Imo House of </p><p>Assembly introduced a bill mandating that employers provide </p><p>for education of their household staff. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Public awareness campaigns continue to blanket Edo and other </p><p>eastern states where most of the commercial sex workers </p><p>originate.  Despite campaign efforts, the lucrative returns </p><p>from the international prostitution trade and prevailing </p><p>economic conditions lower the stigma attached to </p><p>prostitution.  Idia Renaissance works to raise awareness of </p><p>the dangers of trafficking with parents, leaders, </p><p>traditional rulers, village heads, and civic groups.  The </p><p>governor established an Underprivileged Children\'s </p><p>Scholarship Fund for 179 students.  Youths affiliated with </p><p>the Chari-love NGO in Edo wrote, produced, and perform a </p><p>play to educate communities about the deadly allure and </p><p>hazards associated with TIP.  Other on-going campaigns </p><p>include issue-raising by Josephine Anenih, wife of the </p><p>former federal Minister of Works and Housing, as President </p><p>of the Federation of Women lawyers (FIDA) in Edo State, </p><p>whose lobbying efforts brought about the 2000 law increasing </p><p>Edo\'s penalties for traffickers.  Despite the humiliation to </p><p>victims, Governor Lucky Igbinedion has published the names </p><p>of returned prostitutes and their families in the national </p><p>dailies to discourage families from putting their daughters </p><p>into prostitution.  This controversial tactic began to </p><p>stigmatize the prostitution industry in Edo society, which </p><p>had largely grown to accept it as an admirable employment </p><p>for the state\'s young ladies. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In October 2002 in Anambra, Geneveve Ekwochi, the </p><p>commissioner for women affairs told the press that some </p><p>orphanages were selling babies entrusted to their care. </p><p>Following an allegation made against one such home, she </p><p>ordered it closed transferred the home\'s 22 babies to a </p><p>government-owned home.  Ekwochi said the home\'s caretaker </p><p>had been arrested and charged with child trafficking.  She </p><p>said their investigation "had so far found that the babies </p><p>were sold abroad, where their organs such as kidney and </p><p>heart were being transplanted into patients." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Onari Duke, wife of the governor of Cross River, is </p><p>particularly concerned about the sale of children by their </p><p>families in the northern part of the state during the period </p><p>just after the holidays, when families may be financially </p><p>strapped.  Despite the efforts in these particular states, </p><p>Bisi Olateru-Olagberi of Women\'s Consortium of Nigeria </p><p>(WOCON) says funding for shelters that provide housing, </p><p>education, job training, and protection from family members </p><p>for the repatriated women is an unmet and immediate short- </p><p>term need.  Olateru-Olagberi\'s organization\'s preliminary </p><p>research on the problem includes a survey of repatriated </p><p>women.  She also conducts public awareness campaigns and </p><p>national workshops. In the North, Girl-Child Education </p><p>Programs are an important preventive measure. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>D.  The federal government offers little to women and </p><p>children as alternatives to trafficking.  The GON is </p><p>actively engaged in an ILO/IPEC program to end Nigeria\'s </p><p>Worst Forms of Child Labor.  The federal Ministry of Women\'s </p><p>Affairs has few accomplishments to advance the economic or </p><p>social status of Nigerian women.  A handful of national </p><p>leaders are committed to advancing women politically, and </p><p>women have made limited in-roads in this respect during the </p><p>season leading up to the Spring 2003 elections.  Women face </p><p>formidable social and legal barriers to equal opportunity </p><p>with men, including Constitutional discrepancies in women\'s </p><p>rights compared to those of men.  Although primary education </p><p>is compulsory, this requirement is not rigorously enforced. </p><p>Many primary and secondary school aged children work when </p><p>they should be in the classroom.  Child labor experts </p><p>believe that the GON\'s commitment to improving educational </p><p>access is genuine, but tangible results of this commitment </p><p>have yet to materialize (ref B). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>State governments are increasingly taking initiative in </p><p>providing options.  Many recognize that free primary </p><p>education is the best means of relieving the pressure </p><p>poverty places on families most vulnerable to trafficking. </p><p>In Imo state, the government stopped collecting school </p><p>levies and provided school uniforms.  Primary school fees </p><p>are less than a dollar per month, which the government </p><p>believes is an affordable cost to most families.  Most of </p><p>the women returned to Nigeria are ethnic Bini and hail from </p><p>Edo State, the former kingdom of Benin.  Eki Igbinedion, </p><p>wife of the Edo state governor, founded the NGO "Idia </p><p>Renaissance" to fight prostitution and trafficking.  Idia </p><p>also rehabilitates repatriated prostitutes.  At the Idia </p><p>Skills Acquisition Center in Edo, 200 young women enroll in </p><p>four to six month programs teaching in catering, computers, </p><p>secretarial, hairdressing and sewing.  This year, they are </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>venturing into a microcredit cooperative program to foster </p><p>the young girls\' creation of cottage industries to sustain </p><p>themselves.  Idia\'s educational programs address high drop- </p><p>out rates among girls aged 15 to 20. The Edo government\'s </p><p>subcommittee on women\'s political affairs creates awareness </p><p>of the issue, instills responsibility in parents toward </p><p>their children, and educates children to the dangers of the </p><p>trade.  Press reports indicate that traffickers have </p><p>threatened the Igbinedions for their high-profile exposure </p><p>of those involved in the trade. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In 2002 the Rivers State government created seven skills </p><p>acquisition centers in local governments.  They intend to </p><p>place one in each of the 23 local governments.  Skills </p><p>taught in the centers included sewing, hairdressing, </p><p>cosmetics, carpentry, soap- making, computers, catering, and </p><p>decorating.  The Rivers government recognizes a myriad of </p><p>social factors compounds TIP, and is working on ways to </p><p>address them all.  Trafficking in Persons is in large </p><p>measure a symptom of the widespread social, economic and </p><p>political problems that confront Nigeria.  These myriad </p><p>problems will need to be addressed in tandem with the </p><p>creation of greater public awareness of the dangers of TIP </p><p>if TIP itself is to be reduced and eventually eliminated. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In Akwa Ibom state, officials have made in-roads to defining </p><p>the pattern of traffickers and hope to undermine their </p><p>operations with increased surveillance.  In 2002, the police </p><p>commissioner recognized that Akwa Ibom had a large and </p><p>growing trafficking problem.  Law enforcement officials </p><p>there estimate that Akwa Ibom is mainly a "transit center," </p><p>with less than half the victims originating directly from </p><p>the state.  The destinations include Cameroon, Equatorial </p><p>Guinea, South Africa, and Gabon.  Parents of the victims </p><p>within the state have received pay-offs.  The state\'s </p><p>woman\'s commission began airing radio jingles to warn </p><p>parents of the truth behind trafficker schemes.  Their core </p><p>message is that parents must learn to be responsible for </p><p>their children until they are adults, to "get away from the </p><p>idea that sending them to the \'Big City\' will lead to their </p><p>better future."  As the wife of Governor Attah says, "There </p><p>must be a partnership.  The government must say to its </p><p>people, we will educate your child and provide opportunity </p><p>for skills development.  The parent must agree to be </p><p>responsible for the child\'s guardianship until they are </p><p>ready to provide for themselves."  They are engaging in a </p><p>sustained sensitization program, but warn that the </p><p>underlying cause of poverty is less easily addressed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In Abia state, NGOs worked with the Ministry of Women\'s </p><p>Affairs to raise public awareness of the trafficking </p><p>problem.  WOTCLEF held a public forum at Abia State </p><p>University to sensitize mothers to the dangers with allowing </p><p>their children to be sold off.  The women\'s commissioner </p><p>argued that "The problems lie with the parents.  Mothers </p><p>pretend not to see."  Other messages included the warning </p><p>that pursuit of "fast money" and a glorified lifestyle would </p><p>not pay off in the long run. In villages, anti-TIP meetings </p><p>and workshops addressed grassroots.  Churches held meetings </p><p>to raise the issue with parishioners.  There had been a few </p><p>television discussions on the rights of the child and child </p><p>abuse.  UNICEF programs were sensitizing the local </p><p>population about birth control.  The local governments had </p><p>set up child rights committees.  Since 2000, Abia was </p><p>enforcing a "no hawking during school hours" rule to curb </p><p>the time spent out of the classroom by children. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Supplementing individual state efforts, NGOs have made </p><p>significant contributions to preventing TIP.  In Edo State, </p><p>St. Rita\'s Comprehensive High School provides three-year </p><p>vocational training in various programs, including: </p><p>cosmetology, computers, catering, secretarial and </p><p>accountancy, weaving, fashion and designing for more than </p><p>100 students between the ages of 17 and 25.  With additional </p><p>funding, they could double their number of students. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.  The GON is able to support prevention programs, but only </p><p>to a limited extent.  To date, there is no anti-TIP budget </p><p>item.  The GON has many pressing needs before it and has not </p><p>yet focused on a comprehensive anti-trafficking program.  An </p><p>overall improvement in Nigeria\'s badly deteriorated economy </p><p>and education system is needed to address the root causes of </p><p>Nigeria\'s TIP problem.  Moreover, a complete overhaul of the </p><p>system of endemic corruption would free resources for </p><p>productive social programs.  Elected officials regularly </p><p>divert funds specifically allocated to official social </p><p>projects to other use. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>F.  The relationship between the federal executive and </p><p>legislative institutions and NGOs varies depending upon the </p><p>NGO\'s political affiliations.  NGOs\' repeated efforts to </p><p>introduce anti-TIP legislation in the National Assembly were </p><p>thwarted until the Vice-President\'s wife\'s NGO, WOTCLEF, </p><p>successfully submitted the draft anti-TIP law to the </p><p>Assembly in 2001, which finally passed last month (see </p><p>above).  NGOs in all areas of civic society want federal </p><p>funding of their programs.  The involvement of wives of </p><p>government officials has made it increasingly difficult to </p><p>distinguish between genuine NGOs and other politically- </p><p>oriented organizations established under the banner of anti- </p><p>TIP work.  Established NGOs with good grassroots support </p><p>feel threatened by and are often out-financed by NGOs </p><p>created by high-profile political figures.  Despite heavy </p><p>competition for scarce resources, most anti-TIP NGOs are </p><p>familiar with and complimentary of each other\'s work.  Some </p><p>work together or regularly meet to discuss issues of common </p><p>interest.  NGOs frequently applaud the GON\'s permissive </p><p>attitude toward freedom of speech and association since </p><p>1999, a dividend of democracy that is appreciated </p><p>universally. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>G.  No, the GON does not adequately monitor its borders or </p><p>immigration and emigration patterns for evidence of </p><p>trafficking.  Not all law enforcement agencies respond </p><p>appropriately to such evidence.  For example, Embassy </p><p>officers repeatedly have observed small sum payments to </p><p>customs and immigration officers (the equivalent of 20 cents </p><p>to ten dollars) for quick passage without paperwork.  Four </p><p>countries border Nigeria, and illicit trafficking of persons </p><p>and goods is easily conducted via unofficial border </p><p>crossings.  Poorly trained and corrupt immigration officials </p><p>do not look for evidence of trafficking, nor do they usually </p><p>respond adequately when evidence is presented.  As noted </p><p>above, stricter document controls and scrutiny at Murtala </p><p>Mohammed International Airport in Lagos have resulted in a </p><p>shift of trafficking patterns to take advantage of the </p><p>country\'s porous overland borders and coastal maritime </p><p>routes. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>H.  In 2002 the President established an inter-ministerial </p><p>committee to coordinate all federal anti-TIP policies and </p><p>programs.  The committee is chaired by the Minister of State </p><p>for Justice and has subcommittees on law enforcement; </p><p>prevention efforts, legal reform; and planning of an </p><p>international anti-TIP summit. In 2002 President Obasanjo </p><p>established the position of Special Assistant to the </p><p>President on Human Trafficking and Child Labor.  The </p><p>government has a police anti-TIP task force and an </p><p>independent (answering only to the President) anti- </p><p>corruption commission.  However, throughout the year, the </p><p>looming 2003 elections demanded increasing attention by </p><p>senior elected officials. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>I.  The GON continues to participate in regional and </p><p>international conferences and forums addressing TIP, </p><p>including the Regional Meeting on the Implementation of the </p><p>ECOWAS Plan of Action Against Trafficking in Persons in Lome </p><p>in December 2002.  This meeting focused on national actions, </p><p>areas for multilateral cooperation, proposed solutions and a </p><p>Plan of Action for areas of intervention which suffer from </p><p>gaps or duplicate efforts.  The GON postponed its planned </p><p>hosting of an international TIP summit in Abuja August 2002 </p><p>to formulate better regional and international strategies to </p><p>prevent, monitor and combat trafficking. No new date has </p><p>been announced. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>J.  The GON does not yet have a national plan of action to </p><p>address TIP.  The National Labor Advisory Council (NLAC) is </p><p>responsible for receiving and investigating child labor </p><p>complaints and for enforcing regulations.  NLAC, IPEC, and </p><p>UNICEF are coordinating efforts to develop enforcement </p><p>strategies, focusing on awareness and official training </p><p>activities.  The Ministry of Employment, Labor and </p><p>Productivity established a special office for child labor. </p><p>Additional information on child labor issues is in Ref B. </p><p>The inter-ministerial TIP Committee is working toward a </p><p>national plan with the assistance of the USDOL-funded ILO- </p><p>IPEC program.  The Ministries of Women and Child </p><p>Development, Health, Education, Justice and Foreign Affairs </p><p>are key participants in this process, which will include the </p><p>voices of NGOs, according to the responsible Presidential </p><p>Advisor. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>K.  In 2002 President Obasanjo named Michael Mku to the new </p><p>position of Special Assistant to the President on Human </p><p>Trafficking and Child Labor.  Mku has since left the </p><p>position and no replacement has been named. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. INVESTIGATION AND PROSECUTION OF TRAFFICKERS: </p><p>A.  As discussed above, until President Obasanjo signs the </p><p>bill which passed the National Assembly on February 18, </p><p>2003, no federal law specifically prohibits TIP.  With the </p><p>legislation\'s passage, there is renewed hope that anti-TIP </p><p>efforts will be successful as Nigeria\'s criminal code </p><p>undergoes change in this new democracy.  The criminal code </p><p>applying to southern Nigerian states addresses some </p><p>trafficking aspects, especially regarding children, in </p><p>chapter 21.  Sections 276-279 of the Northern Penal code, </p><p>which applies to the 17 northern states, forbid trafficking </p><p>of females for prostitution or any immoral or illegal </p><p>purpose.  It should be noted that each of Nigeria\'s 36 </p><p>states began updating state laws in 1999.  The criminal code </p><p>and the penal code may no longer be universally applicable </p><p>as new laws or court systems (e.g. Shari\'a statutes) have </p><p>supplanted or supplemented older laws.  For example, Edo\'s </p><p>law specifically targets traffickers of women and children, </p><p>adding provisions beyond those found in the criminal code. </p><p>There are laws against kidnapping, rape, and slavery of </p><p>which prosecutors can avail themselves to arrest traffickers </p><p>in many cases. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>B.  There is no federal penalty for trafficking in persons, </p><p>given the lack of a federal trafficking law.  Under the </p><p>criminal code, penalties for trafficking of children include </p><p>fines and imprisonment from two to seven years.  Under the </p><p>penal code, penalties for encouragement of prostitution for </p><p>women or children range up to ten years. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>C.  The penal code protects children from sexual abuse </p><p>through age 14 and defines all abuse under this age as </p><p>rape.  The criminal code prohibits the sexual assault or </p><p>indecent assault of boys under the age of 14 (Criminal code </p><p>Cap. 42, Chapter XXI, S. 216) and girls under the age of 13 </p><p>(Criminal Code Cap. 42, Ch. XXI, S. 218).  Sexual assault of </p><p>girls between the ages of 13 to 15 is known as defilement </p><p>and is categorized as a misdemeanor offense (Criminal code </p><p>Cap. 42, Ch. XXI, S. 221).  For conviction of unlawful </p><p>carnal knowledge or defilement of girls, prosecution must </p><p>take place within two months of the commission of the </p><p>offense, and be corroborated by the testimony of an </p><p>additional witness.  (Comment:  few convictions for sexual </p><p>assault or defilement of girls are won -- or even brought </p><p>before a court -- under these statutes.  The criminal court </p><p>system can take months if not years to hear a case.  It is </p><p>extremely difficult for prosecutors to find a witness to </p><p>corroborate the victim\'s testimony, especially since </p><p>discussion of sexual issues is taboo in most areas.  End </p><p>Comment.)  Anyone causing or encouraging female prostitution </p><p>before age 16 is liable for imprisonment up to two years </p><p>(criminal code Cap. 42, Ch. XXI, S. 222A).  Adults and Rape: </p><p>under the criminal code, rape is defined as "unlawful carnal </p><p>knowledge of a woman or girl, without her consent, if the </p><p>consent is obtained by force or by other means of threat or </p><p>intimidation of any kind, or any fear of harm, or by means </p><p>of false and fraudulent representation as to the nature of </p><p>the act."  The penalty is life imprisonment.  A judge may </p><p>also declare an additional penalty of "whipping" for a </p><p>convicted rapist.  Under Section 282 of the Penal Code, the </p><p>threat of death or injury, or the use of deceit, must be </p><p>used for unlawful carnal knowledge to be considered rape. </p><p>The Penal Code provides for a court to determine any length </p><p>of imprisonment, including life, for rape.  Compared to the </p><p>Edo State law against trafficking, and the provisions in </p><p>Chapter 21 of the Criminal Code, and provisions in the Penal </p><p>Code, Nigerian lawmakers view rape as a much more serious </p><p>offense.  Unfortunately, few offenders are brought to book </p><p>despite these laws. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>D.  As there is no federal law against trafficking, no cases </p><p>have been tried under an anti-TIP law.  Criminal penalties </p><p>and civil fines have not been applied successfully and do </p><p>not deter violations of child labor laws. The GON attempted </p><p>to prosecute one prominent case in 2002 against a well-known </p><p>Lagos businesswoman, Bisi Dan Musa, wife of a former </p><p>presidential candidate.  She was arrested and charged with </p><p>19 counts of child stealing and slave dealing, as no anti- </p><p>TIP law had yet been enacted.  Authorities reportedly found </p><p>16 children between the ages of 1 and 4 in her custody </p><p>without evidence of authorization from the parents.  The </p><p>trial was discontinued after most of the parents could not </p><p>be found or were unwilling to testify, and she was released </p><p>on bail.  As discussed above, the GON in November 2002 was </p><p>searching for a former customs officer and two others </p><p>suspected of trafficking children in Abuja.  The </p><p>investigation is still underway.  At the end of 2002, 30 </p><p>trafficking cases were pending in Edo, which has an anti- </p><p>trafficking law and an anti-TIP police unit, including one </p><p>case against a senior traditional ruler who was stripped of </p><p>his title. Many states arrested known traffickers but were </p><p>forced to release them when victims and their families </p><p>refused to testify.  See also section F below. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.  Some traffickers enjoy strong ties to traditional </p><p>rulers, particularly in Edo and southeastern states.   The </p><p>collusion of victims\' family members impedes law enforcement </p><p>efforts.  As noted previously, anecdotal evidence suggests </p><p>that Edo state-based crime groups control the traffic in </p><p>women and girls from that state to Italy and engage in other </p><p>such criminal activities as drug-trafficking and money- </p><p>laundering.  Moreover, there is increasing evidence that </p><p>former victims of trafficking are involved in the </p><p>recruitment of young girls for commercial sex work in </p><p>Europe.  Some law enforcement and government officials in </p><p>Edo reportedly have been involved in the trade.  Travel </p><p>agencies and employment firms based in the South-East and </p><p>South-South frequently advertise bogus offers of legitimate </p><p>employment in Europe and the U.S.; these firms are suspected </p><p>trafficking fronts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>F.  Interpol and members of the anti-Trafficking Task Force </p><p>have minimal resources for investigations and are </p><p>preoccupied with repatriating victims to their states of </p><p>origin.  The task force swings into action when it receives </p><p>notice of imminent deportation of Nigerian TIP victims from </p><p>Europe or a trafficker is intercepted at the border.  They </p><p>begin investigations by interviewing victims, who generally </p><p>do not cooperate in providing criminal evidence against </p><p>traffickers because of their fear of retribution or </p><p>preternatural curses.  Next, members of the task force will </p><p>videotape the victims and travel to their homes for </p><p>identification purposes and contact their families.  The </p><p>deportees are tested for HIV/AIDS.  Those who test positive </p><p>are turned over to the state of origin\'s commission for </p><p>health.  Electronic surveillance and undercover operations </p><p>are techniques used in the investigation of other criminal </p><p>activities in Nigeria.  Edo State is developing a witness </p><p>protection program and exploring options for camera-based </p><p>testimony.  However, given inadequate resources, such </p><p>techniques are not currently employed in Nigeria\'s anti-TIP </p><p>law enforcement response.  Since traffickers have yet to be </p><p>convicted, the issue of mitigated punishment or immunity </p><p>from prosecution is generally moot. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The government regularly arrests suspected traffickers, </p><p>which has received increased press coverage in the past </p><p>year.  In March 2002, immigration officials arrested 3 </p><p>traffickers and freed 12 victims in the north.  The </p><p>traffickers and the victims were paraded before the press by </p><p>the Minister of Internal Affairs, Chief Sunday Afolabi, who </p><p>used the occasion to condemn trafficking as "modern-day </p><p>slavery" and called for tighter scrutiny of travel documents </p><p>at West African borders.  In April 2002, the State Security </p><p>Service intercepted ten teenage girls being trafficked out </p><p>of Nigeria and arrested the trafficker. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In September 2002, a victim escaped to a nearby police </p><p>station in Oyo State to report that she and three other </p><p>teenagers had been trafficked to Ibadan for CSE from Edo </p><p>State.  The police arrested the two traffickers, but the </p><p>outcome of the case is not known.  In January 2003, police </p><p>in Ebonyi State arrested seven businessmen from Cross River </p><p>State who "were found in possession of ten under-aged boys" </p><p>while traveling to Akure, Ondo State.  Reports said the </p><p>police discovered "different types of charms with the </p><p>suspects, and it was believed that the charms were used in </p><p>making the children to be unconscious."  Children told the </p><p>press that they "did not know their destination, but were </p><p>only promised that they would be helped to make some money. </p><p>The children said they had to start looking for means of </p><p>earning some income because their parents could no longer </p><p>pay their school fees."  Demonstrating the limited social </p><p>understanding of the conventional trafficking definitions, </p><p>the suspects denied involvement in child trafficking, </p><p>"saying that they were only trying to get their junior ones </p><p>to Akure to get employment."  The police commissioner </p><p>"paraded the victims" before journalists, who published the </p><p>children\'s names.  The victims and traffickers were held by </p><p>police while the case was pending.  Also in January 2003, </p><p>immigration officials in Ogun State arrested four suspected </p><p>traffickers and twenty child victims.  Some were allegedly </p><p>in transit for housekeeping work in Lagos, others for </p><p>prostitution.  The cases were pending at the time of this </p><p>report. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>G.  Police understanding of the trafficking problem remains </p><p>varied.  In meeting with USG officials on TIP, police </p><p>commissioners in some states demonstrated their lack of </p><p>understanding of standard TIP definitions.  When given time </p><p>and audience, post has successfully explained the </p><p>distinctions between trafficker and victim, trafficking and </p><p>smuggling, and so on.  Comprehensive training at all levels </p><p>of the law enforcement community would help.  The Nigerian </p><p>Police Force (NPF) soon will receive a specialized anti- </p><p>trafficking training program for members of its anti-TIP </p><p>Task Force as well as members of the general police force </p><p>posted to areas of significant trafficking activity.  This </p><p>project, which the UGG funds and the International Office of </p><p>Migration implements, will seek to add an anti-TIP training </p><p>module to the basic training curriculum for new police </p><p>recruits. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In August 2002, the only female police commissioner, Nana </p><p>Aisha Abdulkadri, announced at a press conference in Port </p><p>Harcourt, Rivers State the creation of an all-female special </p><p>mobile police squad to be deployed "mainly for the fight </p><p>against human trafficking, particularly female trafficking." </p><p>Commissioner Abdulkadri said the squad "will be given </p><p>special training on martial arts" and "used to investigate </p><p>cases of human trafficking, especially women, and as under- </p><p>covers on drug barons as well as to investigate other cases </p><p>that concern women and crime." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>H.  On January 14, 2003, the instruments of ratification of </p><p>the U.S.-Nigerian Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) were </p><p>formally exchanged and the Treaty was entered into force. </p><p>Although the MLAT does not deal specifically with TIP, under </p><p>this treaty, the GON will establish an interagency anti- </p><p>fraud unit and taskforce that will be responsible for </p><p>combating the use of fraudulent documents at MMIA in an </p><p>attempt to gain entry to the U.S.  With this process, </p><p>fraudulent documents should be detected and traffickers </p><p>exposed.  The GON cooperates with other governments on TIP </p><p>investigations and prosecutions.  As in previous reports, </p><p>post cannot provide a specific number of cases.  The most </p><p>significant case remained the 2001-2002 arrest of 15 </p><p>Nigerian traffickers in Conakry and the Guinean government\'s </p><p>subsequent extradition of these 15 to Nigeria (see paragraph </p><p>I below). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>I.  The 1931 U.S.-UK Extradition Treaty was made applicable </p><p>to Nigeria in 1935 and is the legal basis for pending U.S. </p><p>extradition requests.  The GON\'s extradition agreements with </p><p>numerous countries but usually have a "dual criminality" </p><p>requirement: a person is not subject to extradition to stand </p><p>trial for an alleged offense committed in/against a foreign </p><p>country unless that same offense is a crime under Nigerian </p><p>federal law.  Since trafficking is not yet a federal crime, </p><p>traffickers cannot be extradited for that particular </p><p>offense, though they could be extradited for related </p><p>offenses such as kidnapping, slavery, and abuse of a minor. </p><p>The 15 Nigerian traffickers arrested in Conakry were </p><p>extradited to Nigeria, but the 33 women and girl victims </p><p>failed to testify without protection.  The GON\'s early 2002 </p><p>prosecution of the 15 traffickers--including a former police </p><p>commissioner--in this high-profile international case has </p><p>stalled.  It appears unlikely to continue despite the GON\'s </p><p>commitment to make this an example of strong anti-TIP </p><p>enforcement.  The victims were returned to Edo, and some </p><p>were re-trafficked.  Since then, Edo has increased </p><p>prevention efforts by developing skills acquisition centers </p><p>throughout the state for returning victims and other women </p><p>and girls. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>As discussed above, there is evidence of government </p><p>tolerance of trafficking on a local and national </p><p>institutional level.  There are also cases against </p><p>government officials accused of trafficking.  Deputy </p><p>Inspector General (DIG) of Police Ojomo, forcibly retired on </p><p>March 6, 2002, claimed to have been investigating </p><p>allegations of the collusion of Customs officials in the </p><p>illegal trade.  Returnees have made allegations that </p><p>Nigerian Immigration officials accepted bribes to look the </p><p>other way when traffickers take victims out of the country. </p><p>There are credible allegations that some traditional rulers </p><p>in Edo State have assisted traffickers and support the </p><p>recruitment of Bini women into the international sex trade. </p><p>Consequently, efforts to engage local government authorities </p><p>and traditional rulers in an awareness campaign frequently </p><p>run aground because of leadership acquiescence in or support </p><p>of human smuggling. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>K.  See answer in section H of paragraph 2. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>L.  President Obasanjo signed the instruments of </p><p>ratification for ILO Convention 182 concerning the </p><p>prohibition and immediate action for the elimination of the </p><p>worst forms of child labor in 2002, as well as ILO </p><p>Convention 138 concerning Minimum Age for Employment and </p><p>Convention 111 on Equality of Occupation.  On January 28, </p><p>2003, the House of Representatives ratified the Protocol to </p><p>Prevent, Suppress, and Punish Trafficking in Persons, </p><p>especially women and children, which supplements the UN </p><p>Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime. On the </p><p>same day, the House rescinded its previous decision (on </p><p>October 30, 2002) which rejected the Child Rights Bill. </p><p>Public hearings on the bill will review and reconsider the </p><p>bill, whose sections setting the minimum age for marriage at </p><p>18 are considered "offensive" to some Nigerian customs. </p><p>Despite the delay in passing this domestic law on child </p><p>rights, Nigeria did ratify the UN Convention on the Rights </p><p>of the Child in the early 1990s.  The GON signed the </p><p>Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the </p><p>Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography </p><p>on September 8, 2000 but has not yet ratified it.  In 2000, </p><p>the GON became the first African country to sign the </p><p>Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in </p><p>Persons, especially Women and Children (supplementing the UN </p><p>Convention against Transnational Organized Crime), which it </p><p>ratified in 2001. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  PROTECTION AND ASSISTANCE TO VICTIMS: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A.  Clear policies have not yet been established to deal </p><p>with persons trafficked to Nigeria. All regular laws apply. </p><p>For trafficked victims returned to Nigeria, social services </p><p>for resettlement are provided by a small number of </p><p>financially-strapped NGOs, not the government.  Some victims </p><p>are forcibly returned against their will when foreign police </p><p>sweep and round up prostitutes for deportation.  These </p><p>victims usually lose any private property they had acquired </p><p>abroad and arrive home in chains.  Other victims, escaping </p><p>the tight watch of their traffickers, return voluntarily </p><p>through such programs as that offered by IOM. </p><p>The Italian government has provided USD 800,000 to the IOM </p><p>for assistance to women and girls repatriated to Nigeria and </p><p>to provide medical aid for returnees with HIV/AIDS.  The </p><p>Italian government provided another USD one million for </p><p>preventative medical programs discouraging the spread of </p><p>HIV/AIDS in the country. Various actors within the GON have </p><p>made sporadic attempts over the past four years to "parade" </p><p>returned victims before the media to discourage cooperation </p><p>with traffickers.  Media reports have carried estimates of </p><p>the number of those infected by HIV/AIDS in these reports. </p><p>While it may serve as a deterrent to some potential victims, </p><p>this campaign does not provide any assistance to those </p><p>already victimized by the illicit trade. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In Edo State, IOM has opened a brand-new shelter that can </p><p>comfortably house several dozen repatriated trafficking </p><p>victims.  IOM airs jingles, television spots, and displays </p><p>posters and billboards across Edo as a preventive campaign. </p><p>IOM also runs a hotline to answer questions the public has </p><p>about trafficking (although this has had mixed results--some </p><p>callers want information about how to join in CSE </p><p>trafficking).  IOM meets with village heads and arranges </p><p>public viewing of an educational video in the center </p><p>squares. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In December 2002, the Swedish International Development </p><p>Cooperation Agency (SIDA) allocated USD 900,000 over three </p><p>years to support a UNICEF anti-TIP project, its "Model Youth </p><p>Resource Learning Centre in the South-south zone of </p><p>Nigeria."  The project will "reduce the underlying causes of </p><p>child trafficking, youth violence and HIV/AIDS prevalence </p><p>among adolescents in Edo and Delta states in collaboration </p><p>with the Federal Ministry of Women Affairs and Youth </p><p>Development, state and local governments as well as civil </p><p>society actors." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>B.  The GON has planned to provide funding to NGOs, such as </p><p>the National Council for Women Societies, WOTCLEF, the Child </p><p>Welfare League of Nigeria (CWLN), and IDIA Renaissance </p><p>through the Inter-ministerial Committee Against Trafficking </p><p>in Persons to assist returning victims.  To date, such funds </p><p>have not been allocated or received by the NGOs. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>C.  In September 2002, Foreign Minister Sule Lamido publicly </p><p>appealed to host countries of Nigerians abroad that "the </p><p>dignity of Nigerians must be respected, migrant workers of </p><p>Nigerian origin protected and those trafficked recognized as </p><p>victims who must be assisted rather than be dehumanized." </p><p>Victims who are returned from other countries, such as </p><p>Italy, are currently subjected to confinement, sometimes in </p><p>cramped facilities along with criminals for varying periods </p><p>of time.  Victims repatriated to Nigeria are also subjected </p><p>to mandatory testing for HIV/AIDS and other sexually </p><p>transmitted diseases before being released from police </p><p>custody. These repatriated trafficking victims are seldom </p><p>prosecuted for violations of other laws such as immigration </p><p>or prostitution offenses. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>D.  The Police Anti-TIP Task Force encourages repatriated </p><p>victims to provide testimony for the prosecution of Nigeria- </p><p>based traffickers, but it rarely receives adequate evidence </p><p>as many women and girls have been threatened by traffickers, </p><p>often through juju, if they cooperate with law enforcement. </p><p>There is no witness protection program in Nigeria, though </p><p>witnesses could seek legal action against traffickers </p><p>through civil suits (no such suits are known to date). </p><p>Given the lack of a federal trafficking law and the paucity </p><p>of related criminal investigations, it is not known if </p><p>victims who cooperate in an criminal investigation as a </p><p>material witness are permitted to obtain other employment or </p><p>leave the country. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.  No victim or witness protection is currently available, </p><p>though, as mentioned above, the federal government is </p><p>planning to establish long-term care and vocational training </p><p>facilities for returned victims.  Also, witness protection </p><p>measures may be included in the TIP legislation now being </p><p>considered by the President Obasanjo for signature into law. </p><p>Edo State is working to develop a witness protection program </p><p>of its own. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>F.  Italy is by far the destination of choice for Nigerian </p><p>women trafficked abroad.  The GON has stationed a consular </p><p>officer at its embassy in Rome to assist Nigerian </p><p>trafficking victims arrested or rescued by Italian police </p><p>and to facilitate their repatriation to Nigeria.  The </p><p>Nigerian Embassy in Rome works closely with Italian police, </p><p>immigration and Carbineri and coordinates shelter care for </p><p>Nigerian trafficking victims with Catholic NGOs such as </p><p>Caritas.  Diplomatic personnel have been trained in other </p><p>key posts, such as Gabon, Benin, and Togo, to assist, refer, </p><p>and shelter victims. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Nigerian Ambassador to Gabon was personally responsible </p><p>for assisting two children in Libreville who recently </p><p>approached the Embassy for asylum from their trafficker.  He </p><p>contacted the state of origin of the children, which was </p><p>Imo, and WOTCLEF brought the children back to Abuja for </p><p>eventual return to their worried mother, a widow who thought </p><p>her children were in the care of a generous distant </p><p>relative.  The Nigerian Ambassador has set up a small center </p><p>in Libreville to provide shelter to other victims.  Word has </p><p>spread among the Nigerian victims in Gabon that the Embassy </p><p>can help them.  In response to this information, Imo State </p><p>sent an official delegation on a fact-finding mission to </p><p>Libreville.  Upon return, they immediately began their new </p><p>public awareness campaign strategy as discussed above. </p><p>Training of other Nigerian consular officers and members of </p><p>the NPF anti-TIP Task Force in Lagos, appears informal and </p><p>minimal, though the IOM project mentioned previously plans </p><p>to provide a formal training regime for the Police. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>G.  The GON\'s Anti-TIP Task Force provides limited short- </p><p>term shelter for victims of trafficking returned to Nigeria. </p><p>The GON recently donated land in Lagos for a victim transit </p><p>shelter facility.  This is facilitating the IOM\'s voluntary </p><p>repatriation program mentioned previously.  Victims who test </p><p>positive for HIV/AIDS at the short-term shelter in Lagos are </p><p>turned over to the health commissions of their state of </p><p>origin for follow-on treatment and counseling. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>H.  Several NGOs are active on the anti-TIP front, </p><p>including: Eki Igbinedion\'s IDIA Renaissance in Edo; Bisi </p><p>Olateru-Olagberi\'s Women\'s Consortium of Nigeria (WOCON); </p><p>Titi Abubakar\'s WOTCLEF; the International Human Rights Law </p><p>Group; Women Advocates Research and Documentation Center </p><p>(WARDC); Project Alert On Violence Against Women; BAOBAB for </p><p>Women\'s Human Rights; Women, Law and Development Center; </p><p>Nigerian Association of University Women; Central </p><p>Educational Service; Women\'s Rights Watch Nigeria; National </p><p>Commission of Women in Religions\' Committee for the Support </p><p>of the Dignity of Women; Federation of Women lawyers (FIDA). </p><p>The National Coalition Against Trafficking in Persons </p><p>(NACATIP) is an alliance of over a dozen NGOs to address </p><p>common interests and share information at regular meetings </p><p>or via email.  These groups, particularly IDIA Renaissance </p><p>in Edo State, provide long-term comprehensive assistance to </p><p>trafficking victims without receiving federal funding.  The </p><p>stated commitment of President Obasanjo to the fight against </p><p>TIP has not yet yielded funds for these local efforts to aid </p><p>trafficking victims. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  Post\'s contacts on this issue have been Lorelei </p><p>Schweickert and Mark Taylor.  For the remainder of 2003, </p><p>please contact Garace Reynard, +234-9-523-0916, 523-8001, </p><p>523-0960, mobile +234-803-402-1471, email </p><p>reynardga@state.gov. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  Approximately 100 hours were spent by poloff (FS-5) in </p><p>the preparation of this report. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
