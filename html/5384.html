(U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba for </p><p>Reasons 1.5(B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) This message contains an action recommendation: See </p><p>paragraph 9. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) SUMMARY: G/TIP Sally Neumann and NEA/RA Barbara </p><p>Keary visited the UAE (both Abu Dhabi and Dubai) from 22-26 </p><p>January to engage with Emirati officials on the issue of </p><p>trafficking in persons (TIP), discuss current Emirati </p><p>actions to combat it, and recommend other actions for UAEG </p><p>consideration.  The visitors met with policymakers from the </p><p>Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Interior, Justice, Health </p><p>and Labor and officials from the Dubai Police Department. </p><p>The visitors also attended a camel race and discussed labor </p><p>issues with foreign diplomats from those countries with the </p><p>highest numbers of foreign workers resident in the UAE. </p><p>The UAEG welcomed this opportunity to speak first-hand </p><p>about what it has been doing to combat TIP and engage with </p><p>USG experts on additional steps the UAE can take to curtail </p><p>this trade in people.  Across the board, Emirati officials </p><p>stressed that the UAEG is committed to fighting TIP and </p><p>requested training to assist the UAEG in detecting, </p><p>monitoring and combating this transnational crime, which </p><p>they have acknowledged is both a blight on the UAE\'s </p><p>reputation and a threat to its national security.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) G/TIP Sally Neumann and NEA/RA Barbara Keary </p><p>visited the United Arab Emirates from 1/22-26 to discuss </p><p>trafficking in persons and the UAEG\'s efforts to monitor </p><p>and combat it.  On Thursday 22 January, Neumann and Keary </p><p>attended a camel race sponsored by the Emirates Heritage </p><p>Club.  On Saturday 24 January, the visitors met separately </p><p>in Abu Dhabi with officials from the Office of H.H. </p><p>Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Shaykh Hamdan Bin </p><p>Zayid Al Nahyan, officials from the Ministry of Interior, </p><p>and officials from the Ministry of Justice.  The visitors </p><p>also that day discussed foreign labor issues with foreign </p><p>diplomats from the Embassies of India, Sri Lanka, </p><p>Philippines, Bangladesh and Indonesia.  (Note: The </p><p>Pakistani diplomat invitee declined because the Pakistani </p><p>Prime Minister was in town on an official visit. End note.) </p><p>On Sunday 25 January, our visitors met in Abu Dhabi and </p><p>then Dubai with officials from the Ministry of Health, </p><p>officials from the Ministry of Labor, and officials from </p><p>the Dubai Police Department.  (Meetings and events to be </p><p>reported septels.) </p><p> </p><p>UAEG OFFICIALS ACROSS THE BOARD ACKNOWLEDGE TIP, </p><p>STRESS COMMITMENT TO FIGHT IT AND ASK FOR USG ASSISTANCE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) The Emiratis, from MinState Shaykh Hamdan down, </p><p>welcomed the G/TIP visit and the opportunity to discuss </p><p>with our visitors what the UAEG has been doing to combat </p><p>TIP and to engage with USG experts on additional steps the </p><p>UAE can take to curtail this trade in people (reftel).  The </p><p>UAEG\'s positive attitude to this visit was demonstrated by </p><p>the early commitment to meetings and by the attendance and </p><p>number of high-level policymakers at our official meetings. </p><p>All Ministry meetings were led by Emiratis at U/S or Asst </p><p>U/S level and attended by additional, working level, </p><p>Emirati officials. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) Across the board, our Emirati interlocutors began </p><p>the meetings by acknowledging that TIP exists in the UAE, </p><p>primarily in the areas of child camel jockeys and women. </p><p>They also all stressed that the UAEG  rom the top down </p><p>(see reftel) -- is committed to combating this </p><p>transnational crime that is also a matter of humanitarian </p><p>concern to the UAEG senior leadership. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) Officials at the Ministries of Interior and </p><p>Justice reiterated earlier requests for training programs </p><p>to help the UAEG in its efforts to detect, monitor and </p><p>combat trafficking in persons.  Ministry of Labor officials </p><p>also requested training and technical assistance in labor </p><p>inspections.  Ministry of Interior officials further </p><p>requested that the USG assist in the organization of a </p><p>regional conference on trafficking in persons to discuss </p><p>strategies and best practices on determining the scope and </p><p>extent of the problem as well as methods to monitor and </p><p>combat and avenues for inter-governmental cooperation and </p><p>coordination. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) COMMENT:  This TIP visit echoes the success and </p><p>productivity of the U.S.-UAE Strategic Dialogue held in </p><p>Washington, D.C. in November 2002.  All official </p><p>interlocutors were well prepared and eager to discuss the </p><p>government\'s actions in this area -- no doubt motivated by </p><p>the UAEG senior leadership\'s desire to improve its record </p><p>on this issue.  The Emiratis understand that we can only </p><p>report on information that we have, and have promised to </p><p>provide requested statistics and information relating to </p><p>their efforts to fight TIP.  The visit was enlightening in </p><p>that our interlocutors provided information on programs of </p><p>which we were previously unaware and also encouraging </p><p>because they were willing to discuss their current and </p><p>contemplated actions openly in the spirit of cooperation </p><p>and coordination.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) ACTION RECOMMENDATION:  The Emiratis have </p><p>repeatedly requested training to improve the UAEG\'s efforts </p><p>to detect, monitor and combat TIP.  As the 2003 Report </p><p>deadline approaches, we should be as responsive to these </p><p>requests as possible.  We recommend that the Department </p><p>provide information on training programs in the areas of </p><p>TIP prevention, prosecution and victim assistance so that </p><p>we may forward it to the UAEG for consideration.  We also </p><p>recommend that G/TIP consider seriously the UAEG\'s request </p><p>for a USG-organized regional conference on TIP, which the </p><p>UAEG will no doubt offer to host.  END ACTION </p><p>RECOMMENDATION. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U) Post POC on TIP is Poloff Marlene Menard at </p><p>menardmm2@state.gov. </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
