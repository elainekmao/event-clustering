<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L  ZAGREB 001298 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR PM/B (LINO) </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/06/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PARM, MARR, HR, KICC, War Crimes, Regional Issues, Political Parties/Elections </p><p>SUBJECT: SCENESETTER FOR AMB. LINO\'S VISIT TO CROATIA JUNE </p><p>11-12 </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ZAGREB 1296 </p><p> </p><p>     B. STATE 153958 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Lawrence G. Rossin for Reasons 1.5 (B, D) </p><p> </p><p>Overview </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) With its application for membership in the EU\'s </p><p>"in-box" and parliamentary elections around the corner, it is </p><p>extremely unlikely that the Croatian government will move any </p><p>closer to signing an Article 98 Agreement during your visit, </p><p>or even discuss texts.  We expect their entire focus will be </p><p>to argue for a waiver.  This will be one in a series of GoC </p><p>policy choices which have damaged our bilateral relationship </p><p>(ref A).  Your visit represents the USG\'s "extra mile" effort </p><p>to prevent this outcome.  We look forward to your visit and </p><p>to welcoming you to Zagreb. </p><p> </p><p>The Environment </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Croatia submitted its formal application for EU </p><p>membership in December 2002.  Since then, every single GoC </p><p>policy decision has been taken with a view towards how the </p><p>Racan Government believes it will be perceived by the </p><p>European Union.  In the case of Iraq, that meant not only </p><p>declining our request to join the coalition of the willing, </p><p>but publicly crowing about it.  On deciding whether to engage </p><p>toward signing an Article 98 Agreement, that meant taking the </p><p>Patten/Papandreou letter urging candidate countries\' </p><p>adherence to EU guidelines as if it were Holy Writ and as if </p><p>Croatia was actually under active consideration for </p><p>membership in the near term. </p><p>3.  (C) Croatia\'s coalition government came to power in </p><p>January 2000, bringing to an end the corrupt, nationalist </p><p>regime of Tudjman\'s HDZ.  Apart from ejecting the HDZ, </p><p>however, the coalition parties had few major goals in common. </p><p> The Racan Government has managed to hang on through most of </p><p>its four-year mandate, but it has been a rocky ride, </p><p>including countless threats of resignations, several cabinet </p><p>reshuffles and one genuine government crisis.  Although there </p><p>has been no formal announcement, the next parliamentary </p><p>election is widely expected to take place late this autumn. </p><p>All of Croatia\'s politicians believe the best way to get more </p><p>votes is to show that they are more pro-EU than their </p><p>competition. </p><p> </p><p>The Arguments </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) The USG has been pushing Croatia hard, both in </p><p>Washington and in Zagreb, to move forward on an Article 98 </p><p>agreement.  Although the GoC continues to tell both us and </p><p>the public that it has not made a formal decision, we </p><p>understand that the Racan Cabinet has already decided not to </p><p>sign.  The excuses they will present in their meetings with </p><p>your delegation are by this time very familiar, as are the </p><p>reasons they believe Croatia\'s "special circumstances" make </p><p>it a good candidate for a national interest waiver. </p><p> </p><p>-- EU Accession.  While the GoC downplays this argument in </p><p>its discussions with us (since they know it carries little </p><p>weight), it takes the admonition in the Patten/Papandreou </p><p>letter very seriously and will not step outside the lines set </p><p>out in the EU Common Positions.  Despite all indications that </p><p>the EU\'s bark is worse than its bite, the GoC has not </p><p>responded to our urging that it explore what the true, </p><p>limited repercussions of signing an Article 98 agreement </p><p>would be for its application for EU membership. </p><p> </p><p>-- ICTY/ICC Linkage.  Croatia\'s leaders have done nothing to </p><p>explain the differences between ICTY and the ICC to the </p><p>public.  (They acknowledge the distinction to us in private.) </p><p> As a result, they not only presume, self-servingly, but also </p><p>make it more probable that voters would punish them for </p><p>allowing the U.S. to exempt its servicemembers while sending </p><p>Croatia\'s "heroes" to the Hague. </p><p> </p><p>-- Regional Stability.  The GoC believes that the U.S. should </p><p>understand that Croatia is irreplaceable as we seek to build </p><p>stability in the region.  Cutting U.S. military assistance </p><p>would not only slow Croatia\'s progress toward NATO </p><p>membership, but would also impede its effort to increase the </p><p>security of its borders. </p><p> </p><p>-- U.S. - Croatia Relations.  The GoC believes that bilateral </p><p>military ties are the strongest part of our overall </p><p>relationship.  IMET training in particular has been a solid </p><p>investment of good will and good intentions which is at risk </p><p>if the U.S. does not grant Croatia a national interest waiver. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Domestic Political Fallout.  GOC leaders say that voters </p><p>will punish coalition parties if the GoC signs an Article 98 </p><p>agreement.  Since the opposition HDZ is still largely </p><p>undemocratic and supports policies which oppose our goals for </p><p>regional stability, the U.S. cannot afford to risk a return </p><p>to power of the right-wing nationalists.  (This argument </p><p>holds little water since the HDZ has already called publicly </p><p>for the Croatia to sign an agreement.) </p><p> </p><p>Likely Outcome </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) While it is all but certain that the GoC will not </p><p>agree to sign an Article 98 agreement during your visit, it </p><p>will present its engagement with your delegation to the </p><p>Croatian public as a good faith effort to find common ground </p><p>and to make Croatia\'s case for a national interest waiver. </p><p>It also will likely seek to use the visit with us as evidence </p><p>of its serious effort to reach common ground -- i.e., for us </p><p>to grant a waiver. </p><p> </p><p>Managing the Message </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Croatia\'s foreign ministry has already approached us </p><p>seeking to orchestrate a joint press conference and statement </p><p>with a view toward minimizing differences and papering over </p><p>the serious cracks in our bilateral relationship.  That also </p><p>would mainly be for domestic consumption.  We turned them </p><p>down and have instead organized a private interview for you </p><p>with a very solid journalist from Croatia\'s least </p><p>sensationalist daily newspaper where you will be able to lay </p><p>out the facts about ICC and Article 98 and have them reported </p><p>faithfully. </p><p>ROSSIN </p><p>NNNN </p><p></p></div>
