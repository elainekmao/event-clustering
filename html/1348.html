SINCE GENERAL </p><p>SECRETARY PHIEU TRAVELED TO BEIJING IN FEBRUARY, SEVEN </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>SEPARATE POLITBURO DELEGATIONS HAVE VISITED CHINA, AS </p><p>WELL AS MORE THAN 100 OTHER OFFICIAL WORKING-LEVEL </p><p>GROUPS.  WHILE THE VIETNAMESE ARE LOATH TO ADMIT IT, </p><p>HANOI WATCHES THE PRC CLOSELY AS A MODEL FOR INTERNAL </p><p>REFORM: HOW TO PURSUE RAPID ECONOMIC GROWTH WHILE </p><p>MAINTAINING CENTRALIZED POLITICAL CONTROL.  AS </p><p>RELATIONS BETWEEN THE TWO NEIGHBORS HAVE WARMED </p><p>MODESTLY IN THE PAST TWO YEARS, AND AS PHIEU HAS </p><p>CONSOLIDATED CONTROL WITHIN THE COMMUNIST PARTY, </p><p>VIETNAM\'S LEADERS HAVE SELECTIVELY BORROWED FROM THEIR </p><p>CHINESE IDEOLOGICAL BRETHREN ON SEVERAL KEY ISSUES. </p><p>THESE INCLUDE VIETNAM\'S PREPARATIONS OF SEMINAL PARTY </p><p>CONGRESS DOCUMENTS, THE REFORM OF STATE-OWNED </p><p>ENTERPRISES, AND THE MERITS OF COMBINING THE POSITIONS </p><p>OF PARTY GENERAL SECRETARY AND STATE PRESIDENT. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) COMPLEX AND HIGHLY ASYMMETRICAL, THE VIETNAM- </p><p>CHINA RELATIONSHIP HAS BEEN DESCRIBED BY ONE ANALYST </p><p>AS CLASSICALLY CONFUCIAN.  ACCORDING TO THIS THESIS, </p><p>"LITTLE BROTHER" VIETNAM LOOKS WITH CONFLICTING </p><p>EMOTIONS -- SOMETIMES DEFERENCE, SOMETIMES ENVY, </p><p>SOMETIMES REBELLIOUSNESS -- AT ITS "OLDER BROTHER" </p><p>CHINA, WHOSE CULTURE, LANGUAGE AND WORLDVIEW SO </p><p>PROFOUNDLY SHAPE VIETNAM.  WHATEVER THE METAPHOR, </p><p>HANOI\'S COMMUNIST LEADERS SEE THEIR COUNTERPARTS IN </p><p>BEIJING WITH A TIGHTLY INTERWOVEN MIX OF ADMIRATION, </p><p>FEAR AND MISTRUST.  BECAUSE OF THIS, VIETNAM\'S FOREIGN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02480  01 OF 06  100541Z </p><p>POLICY WITH CHINA ARGUABLY CONTAINS AN ELEMENT OF </p><p>APPEASEMENT, SINCE THE MILITARY AND COMMERCIAL THREAT </p><p>FROM THE PRC ALWAYS LOOMS LARGE IN THE BACKGROUND. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) FOR THE VIETNAMESE LEADERSHIP, THEIR PARAMOUNT </p><p>GOAL IS PRESERVING THE COMMUNIST PARTY\'S MONOPOLY ON </p><p>POLITICAL POWER.  IN CHINA THEY SEE A HOPEFUL BUT </p><p>CAUTIONARY CASE STUDY OF HOW TO COMBINE LARGE DOSES OF </p><p>ECONOMIC REFORM WITH A VENEER OF IDEOLOGY IN ORDER TO </p><p>BUILD A MORE PROSPEROUS AND, ULTIMATELY, THEY HOPE, </p><p>STABLE SOCIETY THAT WILL PRESERVE THE PERKS OF POWER </p><p>FOR THE RULING PARTY ELITE.  FROM OUR POINT OF VIEW, </p><p>CHINA VIEWS VIETNAM, ON THE CONTRARY, AS BUT ONE OF A </p><p>NUMBER OF NEIGHBORS ON ITS SOUTHERN BORDER.  WHILE NOT </p><p>UNIMPORTANT AS BOTH A MARKET AND A POTENTIAL SECURITY </p><p>HEADACHE, HANOI PLAYS A RELATIVELY SMALL PART ON THE </p><p>BIGGER STAGE OF BEIJING\'S STRATEGIC AND COMMERCIAL </p><p>CALCULUS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>A FLURRY OF VIETNAMESE LEADERS HEADING NORTH </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) LOOKING BACK OVER THE PAST YEAR, THE STEADY </p><p>STREAM OF HIGH-LEVEL VIETNAMESE DELEGATIONS TO CHINA </p><p>IS STRIKING IN BOTH FREQUENCY AND PROMINENCE.  SINCE </p><p>GENERAL SECRETARY LE KHA PHIEU BEGAN TO CONSOLIDATE </p><p>HIS POLITICAL CONTROL LAST YEAR, THERE HAVE BEEN AT </p><p>LEAST SEVEN DELEGATIONS OF COMMUNIST PARTY OF VIETNAM </p><p>(CPV) LEADERS THAT HAVE TRAVELED TO CHINA, AND MORE </p><p>THAN 100 OFFICIAL GVN WORKING-LEVEL DELEGATIONS, </p><p>ACCORDING TO AN OFFICIAL OF A QUASI-OFFICIAL THINK </p><p>TANK, THE CHINA STUDIES INSTITUTE. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02480  02 OF 06  100542Z </p><p>6. (C) A CHINESE EMBASSY OFFICER TOLD POLOFFS THAT AN </p><p>ENHANCED LEVEL OF CONTACTS BETWEEN THE PARTIES BEGAN </p><p>LAST DECEMBER, WHEN PHIEU TRAVELED SECRETLY TO NANNING </p><p>TO MEET PRC PRESIDENT JIANG ZEMIN.  (IN DECEMBER </p><p>CHINESE PREMIER ZHU RONGJI ALSO MADE AN OFFICIAL VISIT </p><p>TO HANOI.)  PHIEU AND JIANG REPORTEDLY MET ONE </p><p>AFTERNOON AND THE FOLLOWING MORNING, AND PHIEU SOUGHT </p><p>JIANG\'S VIEWS ON TWO ISSUES.  HE SOUGHT TO LEARN FROM </p><p>THE PRC\'S EXPERIENCE OF NEGOTIATING THE WTO ACCESSION </p><p>AGREEMENT WITH THE U.S., WHICH WAS CONCLUDED IN </p><p>NOVEMBER, AND HE WANTED TO DISCUSS THE BENEFITS AND </p><p>PROBLEMS OF GLOBALIZATION WITH THE CHINESE. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) ACCORDING TO THE CHINESE EMBOFF, PHIEU FOLLOWED </p><p>UP HIS SECRET TRIP WITH HIS PUBLIC, OFFICIAL VISIT TO </p><p>BEIJING IN FEBRUARY, WHEN HE MET JIANG AND OTHER </p><p>SENIOR LEADERS.  THAT FEBRUARY TRIP, AS WELL AS THE </p><p>FLURRY OF ENSUING VISITS THAT FOLLOWED, HAVE ALL BEEN </p><p>OFFICIAL ONES AND PUBLICLY REPORTED.  FOREIGN MINISTER </p><p>NIEN MADE HIS FIRST OFFICIAL TRIP ABROAD TO CHINA IN </p><p>FEBRUARY.  NATIONAL ASSEMBLY SPEAKER NONG DUC MANH MET </p><p>JIANG AND CHAIRMAN OF THE NATIONAL PEOPLE\'S CONGRESS </p><p>LI PENG IN BEIJING AND ALSO VISITED SHANGHAI AND THE </p><p>SHENZHEN INDUSTRIAL AREA DURING HIS APRIL 4-10 VISIT. </p><p>LIKE MANY OF THE OTHER POLITBURO DELEGATIONS, MANH </p><p>FOCUSED ON HOW CHINA IS MANAGING REFORM OF STATE-OWNED </p><p>ENTERPRISES (SOES), ACCORDING TO A NATIONAL ASSEMBLY </p><p>OFFICIAL.  FROM MAY 10-12, DEPUTY PM NGUYEN MANH CAM </p><p>ATTENDED A CONFERENCE IN BEIJING ON THE FUTURE OF ASIA </p><p>AND MET WITH PREMIER ZHU. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02480  02 OF 06  100542Z </p><p>8. (C) FROM JUNE 13-14 NGUYEN DUC BINH, THE LONG-TIME </p><p>HEAD OF THE HO CHI MINH ACADEMY (WHICH IS THE </p><p>IDEOLOGICAL TRAINING CENTER FOR SENIOR CPV OFFICIALS), </p><p>CO-CHAIRED A CONFERENCE IN BEIJING BETWEEN THE TWO </p><p>COMMUNIST PARTIES ON IDEOLOGY.  PRC POLITBURO MEMBER </p><p>AND HEAD OF THE CHINESE ACADEMY OF SOCIAL SCIENCES LI </p><p>TIEYING WAS BINH\'S HOST AND COUNTERPART.  THE </p><p>VIETNAMESE ATTACHED GREAT IMPORTANCE TO THIS IDEOLOGY </p><p>CONFERENCE, THE SECOND SUCH MEETING BETWEEN SENIOR </p><p>COMMUNIST OFFICIALS; IN SEVERAL RECENT CPV MEETINGS, </p><p>PARTY OFFICIALS HAVE CANDIDLY ASSESSED THAT CPV </p><p>DIRECTIVES ARE SEEN AS INCREASINGLY IRRELEVANT TO THE </p><p>VIETNAMESE PUBLIC AT LARGE.  AMONG OTHER MATTERS, BINH </p><p>WAS TASKED WITH RESEARCHING CHINESE PERSPECTIVES ON </p><p>VARIOUS IDEOLOGICAL QUESTIONS TREATED IN THE DRAFT </p><p>POLITICAL REPORT BEING PREPARED FOR THE COMMUNIST </p><p>PARTY\'S NINTH PARTY CONGRESS IN MARCH 2001.  THE HEAD </p><p>OF THE GOVERNMENT OFFICE ON RELIGION, LE QUANG VINH, </p><p>WHO IS NOT A POLITBURO MEMBER, VISITED BEIJING FOR </p><p>TALKS WITH HIS CHINESE COUNTERPARTS JUNE 20-27.  WHILE </p><p>VINH IS NOT A SENIOR-LEVEL FIGURE, HIS VISIT ALSO </p><p>DEMONSTRATES HOW VIETNAMESE AGENCIES TREATING </p><p>SENSITIVE IDEOLOGICAL ISSUES SEEK TO COMPARE NOTES </p><p>WITH THEIR CHINESE COUNTERPARTS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) IN EARLY JULY HO CHI MINH CITY PARTY CHIEF </p><p>NGUYEN MINH TRIET HEADED A DELEGATION TO SHANGHAI, </p><p>BEIJING, SHENYANG AND DALIAN.  ONE OF TRIET\'S PURPOSES </p><p>WAS TO LEARN MORE ABOUT SISTER CITY SHANGHAI\'S </p><p>EXPERIENCE IN OPERATING A STOCK EXCHANGE AND HOW THIS </p><p>HAS HELPED SPUR CAPITAL INFLOWS AND INVESTMENT.  (HO </p><p>CHI MINH CITY OPENED THE COUNTRY\'S FIRST STOCK </p><p>EXCHANGE IN JULY.)  TWO KEY POLITBURO MEMBERS FOCUSED </p><p>ON SECURITY MATTERS ALSO TRAVELED TO CHINA IN SEPARATE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02480  03 OF 06  100542Z </p><p>VISITS IN JULY: MINISTER OF PUBLIC SECURITY LE MINH </p><p>HUONG AND DEFENSE MINISTER PHAM VAN TRA.  THE ARMY </p><p>CHIEF OF STAFF, CENTRAL COMMITTEE MEMBER LE VAN DUNG, </p><p>FOLLOWED TRA WITH A VISIT TO BEIJING, SHANGHAI AND </p><p>GUANGZHOU IN LATE OCTOBER.  (COMMENT: THOUGH THE TWO </p><p>COUNTRIES LAST DECEMBER REACHED AGREEMENT DEMARCATING </p><p>THEIR LAND BORDER AND CLAIM THEY ARE SLOWLY ADVANCING </p><p>TOWARD RESOLUTION OF THEIR GULF OF TONKIN DISPUTE, </p><p>MILITARY-TO-MILITARY RELATIONS ARE GENERALLY LIGHT ON </p><p>SUBSTANCE AND, DESPITE GLOWING PUBLIC WORDS FROM BOTH </p><p>SIDES, DEFINITELY NOT EQUAL OR FRIENDLY. END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) PM PHAN VAN KHAI VISITED CHINA SEPTEMBER 25- </p><p>28, HOLDING TALKS WITH PRESIDENT JIANG, PREMIER ZHU, </p><p>AND CHAIRMAN LI PENG (REPORTED FURTHER SEPTEL).  KHAI </p><p>AND ZHU EMPHASIZED IN THEIR PUBLIC STATEMENTS THE </p><p>DESIRE OF BOTH COUNTRIES TO EXPAND INVESTMENT AND </p><p>TRADE, WITH THE GOAL OF $2 BILLION IN TWO-WAY TRADE BY </p><p>YEAR\'S END.  NOT STATED PUBLICLY, HOWEVER, WAS </p><p>VIETNAM\'S WORRY ABOUT THE CHINESE ECONOMIC COLOSSUS. </p><p>CHINA RUNS A HUGE TRADE SURPLUS WITH VIETNAM, </p><p>EXPORTING MORE THAN $843 MILLION IN GOODS AND </p><p>IMPORTING $549 MILLION, ACCORDING TO PUBLISHED </p><p>REPORTS, AND LIKELY HAS A MUCH LARGER SURPLUS WHEN </p><p>SMUGGLED GOODS ARE FACTORED IN.  CHINA\'S EXPORTS ARE </p><p>WIDELY DIVERSIFIED, INCLUDING MOTORCYCLES (THE </p><p>UBIQUITIOUS KNOCK-OFF "HONGDA"), CHEMICALS, TEXTILES, </p><p>AND AGRICULTURAL AND MANUFACTURED GOODS.  BY CONTRAST, </p><p>MOST OF VIETNAM\'S EXPORTS TO CHINA ARE BASIC </p><p>COMMODITIES SUCH AS COAL AND UNREFINED PETROLEUM. </p><p>DIVERSE VIETNAMESE PRODUCERS -- OF FRESH FLOWERS, EGGS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02480  03 OF 06  100542Z </p><p>AND MOTORCYCLES -- HAVE COMPLAINED THAT CHINESE </p><p>COMPETITORS MAY DRIVE THEM OUT OF BUSINESS BY </p><p>UNDERCUTTING THEIR PRICES.  KHAI\'S VISIT WAS FOCUSED </p><p>IN PART ON PRESSING VIETNAM\'S INTERESTS FOR MORE </p><p>BALANCED TRADE. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>COMPARING NOTES WITH THE CONFUCIAN "BIG BROTHER" </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) THE FLURRY OF HIGH-LEVEL COMMUNIST PARTY </p><p>VISITS GOING IN BOTH DIRECTIONS, BUT PARTICULARLY FROM </p><p>VIETNAM TO CHINA, REVEALS THE STRONG INTEREST OF THE </p><p>VIETNAMESE IN "COMPARING NOTES" AND BENEFITING FROM </p><p>THE GREATER EXPERIENCE OF THE CHINESE IN ECONOMIC </p><p>DEVELOPMENT.  AT ONE LEVEL, THIS IS UNSURPRISING. </p><p>AFTER ALL, CHINA AND VIETNAM ARE THE WORLD\'S TWO </p><p>LARGEST REMAINING COMMUNIST STATES, AND HANOI SEEKS TO </p><p>FOLLOW THE PRC IN DRAMATICALLY DEVELOPING ITS ECONOMY, </p><p>WHILE MAINTAINING THE COMMUNIST LEADERSHIP UNRIVALED </p><p>IN POLITICAL POWER. </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) BUT AT THE SAME TIME, THE PROUD VIETNAMESE ARE </p><p>AMBIVALENT ABOUT AND CAUTIOUS IN THEIR DEALINGS WITH </p><p>THE CHINESE.  VIETNAMESE ANALYSTS TELL US, ON THE ONE </p><p>HAND, THEY ARE EAGER TO EMULATE CHINA\'S RAPID ECONOMIC </p><p>GROWTH AND MODERNIZATION; ON THE OTHER, THEY ARE LEERY </p><p>OF THE UNDERCURRENTS OF UNREST IN CHINESE SOCIETY. </p><p>THEY ARE QUICK TO POINT OUT THAT VIETNAM AND CHINA </p><p>HISTORICALLY HAVE EYED EACH OTHER WARILY, WITH HANOI </p><p>PARTICULARLY HAVING MEMORIES OF THE 1979 BORDER </p><p>CONFLICT AND FALLING OUT OVER CAMBODIA.  THE </p><p>VIETNAMESE THUS HAVE NO DESIRE TO BORROW WHOLESALE </p><p>FROM A PRC "MODEL," BUT RATHER TO PICK AND CHOOSE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02480  04 OF 06  100542Z </p><p>BASED ON WHAT THEY BELIEVE WILL WORK FOR THEM.  FROM </p><p>THEIR STATEMENTS, IT IS APPARENT THAT HANOI\'S LEADERS, </p><p>FAR FROM WANTING TO BE A VASSAL OR SUPPLICANT, BELIEVE </p><p>THEY CAN BECOME STRONGER AND MORE INDEPENDENT FROM A </p><p>SELECTIVE BORROWING OF THE CHINESE EXPERIENCE. </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) THE CHINESE EMBOFF TOLD US HE BELIEVES GENERAL </p><p>SECRETARY PHIEU HAS SOUGHT OUT THE CHINESE, PARTLY </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>BECAUSE OF IDEOLOGICAL REASONS AND PARTLY BECAUSE OF </p><p>THE CULTURAL AFFINITY MANY VIETNAMESE FEEL TOWARD </p><p>CHINESE.  (IN THIS REGARD, ONE MFA OFFICIAL TOLD US </p><p>THE VIETNAMESE FEEL "COMFORTABLE" DEALING WITH THE </p><p>CHINESE BECAUSE "WE KNOW HOW THEY THINK.")  THE </p><p>CHINESE EMBOFF SAID THAT DURING THE VIETNAMESE NEW </p><p>YEAR, PHIEU HOSTED A PRIVATE DINNER FOR THE CHINESE </p><p>AMBASSADOR AND ONLY A HANDFUL OF HIS CLOSEST </p><p>CONFIDANTS.  PHIEU TOLD THE CHINESE THIS WAS THE ONLY </p><p>TIME HE HAD HOSTED AN AMBASSADOR FOR DINNER. </p><p>ATTENDING WITH HIM WERE A KEY ASSISTANT, A CPV </p><p>EXTERNAL RELATIONS OFFICIAL, AND TWO POLITBURO MEMBERS </p><p>-- DEFENSE MINISTER PHAM VAN TRA AND THE ARMY </p><p>POLITICAL COMMISSAR NGUYEN THANH NGAN.  ANOTHER SIGN </p><p>OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THE CHINESE RELATIONSHIP WAS THAT </p><p>PHIEU\'S PREDECESSOR, NOW SENIOR ADVISOR DO MUOI, MET </p><p>FIRST WITH THE CHINESE AMBASSADOR DURING TET, FOLLOWED </p><p>BY AMBASSADOR PETERSON THE NEXT DAY.  (THE MEETINGS </p><p>WERE FEATURED IN FRONT-PAGE PHOTOS IN VIETNAMESE MEDIA </p><p>ON SUCCESSIVE DAYS.) </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) COLLECTIVELY, THE STREAM OF HIGH-LEVEL VISITS </p><p>OVER THE PAST YEAR ADDS UP TO AN IMPORTANT ONGOING </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02480  04 OF 06  100542Z </p><p>DIALOGUE, WHICH HELPS THE VIETNAMESE CRIB FROM CHINA\'S </p><p>EXPERIENCE IN ECONOMIC REFORM.  A VIETNAMESE THINK </p><p>TANK OFFICIAL TOLD US THE TWO COMMUNIST PARTIES </p><p>EXCHANGE EXPERIENCES ON STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISE REFORM, </p><p>WORLD ECONOMIC INTEGRATION, BANKING AND FINANCIAL </p><p>REFORMS, REDUCING UNEMPLOYMENT, AND "PRESERVING </p><p>NATIONAL CULTURE DURING THE PROCESS OF GLOBALIZATION." </p><p>IN THE RUN-UP TO THE SIGNING OF THE BILATERAL TRADE </p><p>AGREEMENT (BTA) BETWEEN THE U.S. AND VIETNAM IN JULY, </p><p>OUR REPORTING DOCUMENTED THE IMPORTANT ROLE THAT </p><p>CHINA\'S NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE U.S. ON WTO ACCESSION </p><p>PLAYED IN VIETNAM\'S CALCULUS.  VIETNAMESE OF~OMMENDED </p><p>THAT VIETNAM WAIT UNTIL CHINA "WENT FIRST" BEFORE </p><p>VIETNAM CONCLUDED ITS BTA DEAL. </p><p> </p><p>15. (C) THE CHINESE EMBOFF SAID THE FEBRUARY PHIEU </p><p>VISIT AND THE JUNE BINH VISIT FOCUSED ON A NUMBER OF </p><p>KEY QUESTIONS TO BE INCORPORATED IN THE DOCUMENTS OF </p><p>THE NINTH PARTY CONGRESS.  THE CPV HAS CONSCIOUSLY </p><p>BORROWED FROM THE CHINESE, HE SAID, REGARDING THE </p><p>FORMULATION OF DIFFERENT ECONOMIC SECTORS AND </p><p>OWNERSHIP QUESTIONS, WHICH WERE TREATED AT CHINA\'S </p><p>15TH PARTY CONGRESS.  LIKEWISE, A VIETNAMESE THINK </p><p>TANK DIRECTOR TOLD POLOFF THAT SEVERAL VIETNAMESE </p><p>DELEGATIONS HAD SOUGHT PRC ADVICE ON SOE REFORM. </p><p>DEPUTY PM NGUYEN TAN DUNG, WHO VISITED CHINA IN 1999, </p><p>HAD FOCUSED ON THIS QUESTION, AS HAD HCMC PARTY CHIEF </p><p>TRIET, WHO DISCUSSED SOE REFORM IN DEPTH WITH LEADERS </p><p>IN SHENYANG AND DALIAN DURING HIS JULY 2000 VISIT. </p><p> </p><p>16. (C) THE PRC EMBOFF ALSO SAID THE VIETNAMESE HAD </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02480  05 OF 06  100543Z </p><p>INQUIRED WITH INTEREST ABOUT THE PRC\'S EXPERIENCE OF </p><p>HAVING ONE SENIOR LEADER OCCUPY THE TWO POSTS OF PARTY </p><p>GENERAL SECRETARY AND STATE PRESIDENT.  AFTER TWO OF </p><p>THE POLITBURO DELEGATIONS RETURNED FROM THE PRC, THEY </p><p>REPORTEDLY NOTED FAVORABLY HOW THE CHINESE MODEL OF </p><p>COMBINING THESE TWO SENIOR POSTS FUNCTIONS.  A </p><p>VIETNAMESE SOURCE LIKEWISE CONFIRMED THAT DEPUTY PM </p><p>DUNG REPORTED FAVORABLY ON JIANG\'S DUAL ROLES. </p><p>(COMMENT: THIS ISSUE REMAINS CONTENTIOUS AMONG THE CPV </p><p>LEADERSHIP, AND IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER PHIEU WILL BE </p><p>SUCCESSFUL IN PUSHING THROUGH THIS REFORM TO ALLOW HIM </p><p>GREATER CLOUT, A LA JIANG.  ARGUING AGAINST SUCH A </p><p>CHANGE IS THE HISTORICALLY CONSENSUS-BASED DECISION- </p><p>MAKING STYLE OF THE VIETNAMESE POLITBURO, WHICH IN </p><p>CONTRAST TO THE PRC SYSTEM, HAS NOT GRANTED SUPREME </p><p>POWER TO ONE LEADER, BUT INSTEAD HAS CAREFULLY SOUGHT </p><p>TO BALANCE FACTIONS IN THE INTEREST OF PRESERVING </p><p>STABILITY.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>17. (C) SINCE LE KHA PHIEU BEGAN TO CONSOLIDATE </p><p>CONTROL WITHIN THE CPV LEADERSHIP LAST YEAR, A </p><p>DEEPENING OF THE IDEOLOGICAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THE </p><p>CHINESE HAS BECOME MORE AND MORE APPARENT.  VIEWED IN </p><p>AGGREGATE, THE NUMBER AND FREQUENCY OF HIGH-LEVEL </p><p>DELEGATIONS BETWEEN THE TWO COMMUNIST PARTIES AND </p><p>GOVERNMENTS ARE STRIKING.  THIS OBVIOUSLY IS A FAR </p><p>MORE IMPORTANT RELATIONSHIP FOR THE VIETNAMESE THAN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02480  05 OF 06  100543Z </p><p>FOR THE CHINESE, AND IT SEEMS THAT AS THE CPV PREPARES </p><p>FOR ITS NINTH PARTY CONGRESS NEXT MARCH, THE </p><p>VIETNAMESE ARE FEELING FREE TO BORROW, PERHAPS MORE SO </p><p>THAN IN RECENT MEMORY, FROM THEIR CHINESE BRETHREN. </p><p> </p><p>18. (C) AT THE SAME TIME, PRC EMBOFFS GO TO GREAT </p><p>LENGTHS TO DESCRIBE THE BILATERAL MILITARY-TO-MILITARY </p><p>RELATIONSHIP AS HEAVY ON VACUOUS OFFICIAL VISITS AND </p><p>LIGHT ON SUBSTANCE.  FOR REASONS OF THEIR OFTEN- </p><p>CONFLICTIVE HISTORY, VIETNAM WILL CONTINUE TO REGARD </p><p>CHINA WARILY.  ALL THE WHILE, HOWEVER, TRADE BETWEEN </p><p>THE TWO COUNTRIES IS BOOMING, HAVING INCREASED </p><p>OFFICIALLY BY MORE THAN 50 PERCENT IN THE PAST TWO </p><p>YEARS.  BUT EVEN THIS IS A DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD FOR THE </p><p>VIETNAMESE, SINCE THEY FEAR CHINESE MANUFACTURERS MAY </p><p>DUMP GOODS ON THE VIETNAMESE MARKET AND DRIVE NASCENT </p><p>VIETNAMESE INDUSTRIES OUT OF BUSINESS. </p><p> </p><p>19. (C) IN VIETNAM\'S STRATEGIC CALCULUS, CHINA WILL </p><p>CONTINUE TO LOOM LARGE -- AS COMPETITOR BUT ALSO AS </p><p>MODEL.  IN ONE SENSE, HANOI HAS LITTLE CHOICE.  SINCE </p><p>THE FALL OF THE SOVIET UNION, THE BOAT THAT THE </p><p>WORLD\'S FIVE REMAINING COMMUNIST COUNTRIES FIND </p><p>THEMSELVES IN HAS GOTTEN SMALLER AND MORE RICKETY. </p><p> </p><p>WHETHER OUT OF DESPERATION OR INSPIRATION, VIETNAM </p><p>FINDS LITTLE RECOURSE BUT TO LOOK TO CHINA -- THE </p><p>LARGEST, MOST IMPORTANT AND MOST PROSPEROUS OF THE </p><p>FIVE -- FOR IDEAS ON ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL REFORM. </p><p>END COMMENT. </p><p>PETERSON </p><p> </p><p>NOTE: NOT PASSED TO ABOVE ADDRESSEE(S) </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
