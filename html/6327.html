<p>UNCLAS ADANA 0073 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EUR/SE AND DRL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, TU, ADANA </p><p>SUBJECT:  GAZIANTEP PARLIAMENTARIANS EXPLAIN </p><p>          THE FAILED RESOLUTION </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  In a March 12 phone call with Consul, </p><p>Gaziantep newspaper publisher Aykut Tuzcu (please </p><p>protect) a reliable and trustworthy contact, </p><p>relayed the explanation offered to him by three </p><p>Gaziantep parliamentarians for the failure of the </p><p>Turkish parliament to approve the proposed </p><p>resolution to allow sending of Turkish troops and </p><p>receiving of American troops in its March 1 vote. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  "We voted against the resolution," they said, </p><p>"even though we supported it."  Why?   The </p><p>parliamentarians said that no one in the Turkish </p><p>parliament had focused on or truly understood the </p><p>technicality of needing an absolute majority, </p><p>i.e. a majority of all votes cast (for, against, </p><p>abstentions).  Thus, some parliamentarians, </p><p>including themselves, reckoned that they had a </p><p>vote to "waste." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  Why, though, vote against something that you </p><p>support?  "Because," they said, "we wanted to </p><p>send a signal to the country and the world that </p><p>Turkey is a democracy, and that it can\'t be </p><p>`bought\' by the United States." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  The embarassing pandemonium that followed the </p><p>vote - in which all networks inaccurately </p><p>reported at first that the resolution had passed </p><p>- was a consequence of the fact that not only </p><p>parliamentarians, but also the press, are hazy on </p><p>Turkish parliamentary procedure, and lends </p><p>credence to this explanation. </p><p>HOLTZ </p><p></p></div>
