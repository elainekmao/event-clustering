(SBU) SUMMARY: ACCORDING TO TWO ETHNIC MINORITY </p><p>LEADERS, ETHNIC MINORITY PROTESTANTS IN THE CENTRAL </p><p>HIGHLANDS ENCOUNTERED A MIXTURE OF TOLERANCE AND </p><p>REPRESSION BY LOCAL AUTHORITIES AT CHRISTMASTIME. </p><p>THERE WERE ALLEGED INCIDENTS OF SEVERE POLICE ABUSE IN </p><p>SOME VILLAGES, BUT IN OTHER VILLAGES, AUTHORITIES </p><p>SEEMED TO ALLOW GROUPS AS LARGE AS SEVERAL HUNDRED </p><p>PEOPLE TO ATTEND CHRISTMAS PRAYER SERVICES.  IN A </p><p>SEPARATE INCIDENT, VIETNAMESE SOLDIERS WERE ALLEGED TO </p><p>HAVE KILLED AS MANY AS EIGHT PERSONS WHEN UP TO 230 </p><p>PERSONS WERE PREVENTED FROM CROSSING THE BORDER INTO </p><p>CAMBODIA ON CHRISTMAS DAY.  SEPTEL REPORTS FURTHER ON </p><p>PROTESTANTS IN THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>CHRISTMAS IN THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>2. (SBU) ON JANUARY 15, TWO ETHNIC MINORITY PROTESTANT </p><p>LEADERS, ONE FROM DAK LAK PROVINCE AND ONE FROM GIA LAI </p><p>PROVINCE, CAME DOWN FROM THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS TO MEET </p><p>WITH CG AND POLOFF FOR MORE THAN TWO HOURS.  THEY SAID </p><p>LOCAL AUTHORITIES IN THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS HAD BEEN </p><p>WORRIED THAT THE SAME GROUPS WHO HAD ORGANIZED ANTI- </p><p>GOVERNMENT DEMONSTRATIONS IN FEBRUARY/MARCH 2001 WOULD </p><p>USE CHRISTMAS AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO STAGE MORE </p><p>DEMONSTRATIONS.  OFFICIALS IN THE VARIOUS LOCALITIES </p><p>TOOK DIFFERENT APPROACHES IN TRYING TO PREVENT </p><p>CHRISTMAS GATHERINGS FROM GETTING OUT OF HAND.  IN SOME </p><p>LOCATIONS, OFFICIALS ALLOWED GATHERINGS OF SEVERAL </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HO CHI  00039  01 OF 03  151450Z </p><p>HUNDRED PEOPLE; IN OTHER PLACES, THEY ALLOWED PEOPLE TO </p><p>PRAY TOGETHER ONLY IN SMALL GROUPS IN THEIR HOMES.  YET </p><p>IN OTHERS, PROTESTANT CHRISTMAS CELEBRATIONS WERE </p><p>FORBIDDEN OUTRIGHT. SOME LOCAL AUTHORITIES PUSHED </p><p>CHRISTMAS SERVICES AHEAD TO THE SUNDAY BEFORE </p><p>CHRISTMAS. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) ACCORDING TO THE LEADER FROM DAK LAK PROVINCE, </p><p>400-500 ETHNIC MINORITY PROTESTANTS GATHERED IN BUON </p><p>CUOR KNIA VILLAGE FOR AN OUTDOOR CHRISTMAS EVE VIGIL </p><p>THAT AUTHORITIES ALLOWED TO GO ON ALL NIGHT.  (POST </p><p>NOTE: THIS VILLAGE WAS VISITED BY CONGENOFFS DURING A </p><p>PRE-CHRISTMAS TRIP TO THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS.)  ON </p><p>CHRISTMAS DAY, HOWEVER, THE TWO ETHNIC MINORITY </p><p>MINISTERS WHO LED THE SERVICES WERE DETAINED AND HELD </p><p>FOR FIVE DAYS.  THEIR DETENTION WAS NOT IN CONNECTION </p><p>WITH THE CHRISTMAS SERVICE, ACCORDING TO OUR SOURCE. </p><p>POLICE DETAINED THEM BECAUSE THEY WERE SUSPECTED OF </p><p>BEING INVOLVED WITH TWELVE VILLAGERS WHO HAD ATTEMPTED </p><p>TO CROSS THE BORDER TO CAMBODIA ON CHRISTMAS DAY (SEE </p><p>NEXT SECTION). </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) THE LEADER SAID THAT IN KRONG PA DISTRICT, DAK </p><p>LAK PROVINCE, ABOUT 600 ETHNIC MINORITY PROTESTANTS </p><p>GATHERED FOR AN OUTDOOR CHRISTMAS VIGIL.  ON CHRISTMAS </p><p>DAY, HOWEVER, POLICE SUMMONED THE FEMALE MINISTER OF </p><p>THE CONGREGATION TO THE POLICE STATION FOR SEVERAL DAYS </p><p>OF QUESTIONING.  OUR SOURCE SPECULATED THE POLICE WERE </p><p>DISMAYED AT THE LARGE TURNOUT AT HER CHURCH. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) THE LEADER SAID THAT HE HAD PERSONALLY LED A </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HO CHI  00039  01 OF 03  151450Z </p><p>PRAYER CEREMONY OF ABOUT 250 PERSONS OUTSIDE HIS HOME. </p><p>HE SAID HE WAS AWARE OF AT LEAST FIVE OR SIX OTHER </p><p>PLACES IN DAK LAK PROVINCE WHERE PEACEFUL PRAYER </p><p>GATHERINGS OF MORE THAN 100 PERSONS TOOK PLACE.  HE </p><p>SAID THAT IN NUMEROUS VILLAGES IN THE PROVINCE, POLICE </p><p>ALLOWED GROUPS OF 50 PEOPLE OR FEWER TO GATHER IN HOMES </p><p>TO CELEBRATE CHRISTMAS. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) THIS SOURCE EMPHASIZED, HOWEVER, THAT IN OTHER </p><p>VILLAGES IN DAK LAK PROVINCE, AUTHORITIES PASSED THE </p><p>WORD THAT NO ETHNIC MINORITY PROTESTANT CHRISTMAS </p><p>SERVICES WOULD BE ALLOWED.  AS A RESULT, OUR SOURCE </p><p>CLAIMED MOST ETHNIC MINORITY CHRISTIANS EITHER DID NOT </p><p>CELEBRATE CHRISTMAS OR PRAYED QUIETLY IN THEIR HOMES. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) THE LEADER FROM GIA LAI PROVINCE SAID </p><p>CHRISTMAS THERE WAS SIMILAR.  IN PLEI BRENG VILLAGE, </p><p>NEAR THE PROVINCIAL SEAT OF PLEIKU, SOLDIERS ASSISTED </p><p>IN ORGANIZING THE CHRISTMAS PRAYER SERVICES.  THIS </p><p>SOURCE SPECULATED IT WAS LESS A MATTER OF HOLIDAY </p><p>SPIRIT THAN A MEANS FOR MAINTAINING CONTROL OVER </p><p>EVENTS.  HE SAID THAT IN GIA LAI\'S CHU PRONG AND CHU SE </p><p>DISTRICTS, NO CHRISTMAS CELEBRATIONS WERE ALLOWED. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) IN PEK VILLAGE IN DAK DOA DISTRICT, ABOUT 1500 </p><p>PERSONS GATHERED ON DECEMBER 24, AND WERE PREPARING TO </p><p> </p><p></p><p>PAGE 02        HO CHI  00039  02 OF 03  151451Z </p><p>SUBJECT: CHRISTMAS IN THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS: TOLERANCE </p><p>AND REPRESSION FOR ETHNIC MINORITY PROTESTANTS </p><p> </p><p>STAGE AN ANTI-GOVERNMENT DEMONSTRATION.  AFTER A FEW </p><p>HOURS, POLICE AND ETHNIC MINORITY PROTESTANT LEADERS </p><p>PERSUADED THE PEOPLE TO RETURN TO THEIR HOMES </p><p>PEACEFULLY.  OUR SOURCE SAID HE WITNESSED EVENTS IN DAK </p><p>DOA PERSONALLY. </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) HE SAID THAT POLICE DETAINED AND TORTURED TWO </p><p>PASTORS FROM CHU SE DISTRICT BY PUTTING STICKS BETWEEN </p><p>THEIR FINGERS AND THEN SLAMMING THEIR HANDS WITH A </p><p>BOOK.  ONE OF THE TWO, 32-YEAR-OLD R\'MAH NHUI (ALSO </p><p>KNOWN AS AMA SOREN) FROM IA LE VILLAGE IN CHU SE </p><p>DISTRICT, CAME TO THE LEADER\'S HOME AND SHOWED HIM HIS </p><p>BROKEN FINGERS.  HE ASSERTED THE POLICE DID THIS </p><p>BECAUSE THEY HEARD HE WAS PLANNING TO ORGANIZE A </p><p>CHRISTMAS PRAYER SERVICE. </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) SPECIFICALLY ASKED ABOUT ALLEGATIONS OF </p><p>TORTURE BY ELECTRIC SHOCK, THE LEADER FROM GIA LAI </p><p>PROVINCE SAID HE WAS UNAWARE OF POLICE USING THESE </p><p>TACTICS.  THE LEADER FROM DAK LAK PROVINCE, HOWEVER, </p><p>SAID BUON CUOR KNIA POLICE BEAT UP AND SHOCKED WITH </p><p>ELECTRIC WIRES 12 PEOPLE WHO HAD ATTEMPTED TO CROSS </p><p>INTO CAMBODIA.  BOTH LEADERS SAID POLICE -- ETHNIC </p><p>MINORITY AS WELL AS ETHNIC VIETNAMESE KINH -- ROUTINELY </p><p>ROUGHED UP SUSPECTS DURING DETENTION.  NEITHER SOURCE </p><p>WAS AWARE OF ANYONE DETAINED IN CONNECTION WITH </p><p>CHRISTMAS SERVICES WHO WAS STILL BEING HELD. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HO CHI  00039  02 OF 03  151451Z </p><p>ALLEGATIONS OF KILLINGS ON THE CAMBODIAN BORDER </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>11. (SBU) BOTH LEADERS RELATED THAT APPROXIMATELY 230 </p><p>ETHNIC MINORITY PERSONS ATTEMPTED TO CROSS INTO </p><p>CAMBODIA ON CHRISTMAS DAY.  THEY CAME IN TWO GROUPS - </p><p>ONE GROUP OF ABOUT 30 PERSONS FROM KON TUM PROVINCE; </p><p>ANOTHER GROUP OF ABOUT 200 PERSONS FROM DAK LAK </p><p>PROVINCE.  A GUIDE LED THEM TO A PLACE ON THE CAMBODIAN </p><p>BORDER NEAR GIAO VILLAGE IN DAK MIL DISTRICT, DAK LAK </p><p>PROVINCE. </p><p> </p><p>12. (SBU) ACCORDING TO OUR SOURCES, THE GUIDE TOLD THE </p><p>GROUP HE WOULD LEAVE THEM AND RETURN AFTER PURCHASING A </p><p>MOBILE PHONE IN DAK MIL TOWN.  TWO HOURS LATER, </p><p>VIETNAMESE SOLDIERS SURROUNDED THE GROUP.  THE LEADERS, </p><p>WHO WERE RELATING SECOND-HAND REPORTS, INSISTED THAT </p><p>ONE GROUP OF VIETNAMESE SOLDIERS APPROACHED FROM THE </p><p>EAST AND ANOTHER FROM THE WEST, I.E. VIETNAMESE FROM </p><p>THE CAMBODIAN SIDE OF THE BORDER.  OUR DAK LAK SOURCE </p><p>SAID THIS WAS CLEARLY A "SET-UP". </p><p> </p><p>13. (SBU) THIS LEADER FROM DAK LAK SAID A SECURITY </p><p>OFFICIAL TOLD HIM THAT 186 PERSONS WERE DETAINED, BUT </p><p>MOST WERE RETURNED TO THEIR HOME VILLAGES BY MILITARY </p><p>VEHICLE AND RELEASED THE SAME DAY.  HE STRESSED THAT </p><p>NONE OF THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN IN THE GROUP WAS </p><p>MISTREATED, BUT ASSERTED THAT A DOZEN MEN WERE BEATEN </p><p>AND TORTURED WITH ELECTRIC SHOCK UPON THEIR RETURN TO </p><p>BUON CUOR KNIA. </p><p> </p><p>14. (SBU) THE LEADER FROM GIA LAI PROVINCE SAID THAT </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HO CHI  00039  02 OF 03  151451Z </p><p>ETHNIC MINORITY VILLAGERS WHO LIVE IN THE AREA TOLD HIM </p><p>THAT NEAR TO WHERE KON TUM, GIA LAI AND THE CAMBODIAN </p><p>PROVINCES OF RATANAKIRI AND MONDULKIRI MEET, SEVERAL </p><p>PERSONS FROM THE GROUP BEING RETURNED TO KON TUM TRIED </p><p>TO ESCAPE.  SOLDIERS OPENED FIRE AND KILLED FOUR </p><p>PERSONS, ACCORDING TO THESE VILLAGERS.  IN A SEPARATE </p><p>INCIDENT, ACCORDING TO THIS SAME LEADER, SOLDIERS SHOT </p><p>AND MAY HAVE KILLED FOUR OTHER PEOPLE AS THEY TRIED TO </p><p>ESCAPE BY SWIMMING ACROSS THE SRE PAK RIVER IN DAK LAK </p><p>PROVINCE. (THE LEADER FROM DAK LAK PROVINCE DID NOT </p><p>MENTION THESE INCIDENTS BEFORE DEPARTING.)  WHEN ASKED </p><p>SPECIFICALLY IF HE BELIEVED IT WAS GVN POLICY TO KILL </p><p>VILLAGERS ATTEMPTING TO CROSS INTO CAMBODIA, OUR GIA </p><p>LAI SOURCE SAID "NO", BUT HE BELIEVES SOLDIERS ARE TOLD </p><p>TO "STOP PEOPLE FROM CROSSING," AND SOMETIMES "MISTAKES </p><p>ARE MADE." </p><p> </p><p>15. (SBU) THE LEADER FROM GIA LAI PROVINCE SAID THAT </p><p>TWO OF THE 30 PEOPLE FROM KON TUM PROVINCE ARE STILL </p><p>UNDER DETENTION IN A PRISON IN PLEIKU.  THEIR NAMES ARE </p><p>HOANH AND AMA XUAN.  THREE PERSONS FROM DAK LAK ARE </p><p>STILL BEING DETAINED, BUT HE KNEW THE NAME OF ONLY ONE </p><p>OF THEM - RAHLAM LUA (ALSO KNOWN AS AMA DUY). </p><p> </p><p>"DEGA PROTESTANTS" VS. MAINSTREAM PROTESTANTS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p></p><p>16. (SBU) BOTH LEADERS SPOKE OPENLY ABOUT THE SPLIT </p><p>BETWEEN MAINSTREAM ETHNIC MINORITY PROTESTANTS IN THE </p><p>CENTRAL HIGHLANDS AND THE "DEGA PROTESTANTS" WHO </p><p>ACTIVELY SUPPORT AN INDEPENDENT ETHNIC MINORITY </p><p>("DEGA") STATE IN THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS.  ALL OF THE </p><p>PERSONS WHO ATTEMPTED TO CROSS THE BORDER INTO CAMBODIA </p><p>WERE "DEGA PROTESTANTS," ACCORDING TO THE LEADERS.  THE </p><p>LEADER FROM DAK LAK PROVINCE CHARACTERIZED THE "DEGA </p><p>PROTESTANTS" AS "FALSE CHRISTIANS," WHO IGNORE THE </p><p>ADVICE OF "TRUE" PROTESTANT PASTORS TELLING THEM NOT TO </p><p>GO TO CAMBODIA. </p><p> </p><p>17. (SBU) WHEN ASKED DIRECTLY ABOUT THE REASONS FOR </p><p>ETHNIC MINORITY VILLAGERS TO CROSS INTO CAMBODIA, THE </p><p>LEADER FROM GIA LAI PROVINCE DIVIDED THE GROUPS INTO </p><p>TWO.  HE SAID HE BELIEVED THE PEOPLE WHO FLED TO </p><p>CAMBODIA IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE FEBRUARY/MARCH 2001 </p><p>UNREST WANTED TO ESCAPE GVN PERSECUTION.  BUT, HE </p><p>BELIEVES THOSE WHO HAVE GONE TO CAMBODIA SINCE THE </p><p>SUMMER (INCLUDING THE GROUP WHO ATTEMPTED TO CROSS ON </p><p>CHRISTMAS DAY) WERE MOTIVATED BY PROMISES OF MONEY AND </p><p>THE HOPE OF RESETTLEMENT IN THE U.S. HE ASSERTED THEY </p><p>HAD "HEARD BY TELEPHONE" THAT SUCH OPPORTUNITIES WERE </p><p>AVAILABLE. (NOTE: THIS ETHNIC MINORITY LEADER\'S COMMENT </p><p>IS SIMILAR TO WHAT GVN OFFICIALS HAVE BEEN TELLING US. </p><p>END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>18. (SBU) SINCE THIS GIA LAI SOURCE WAS FAMILIAR WITH </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HO CHI  00039  03 OF 03  151451Z </p><p>THE MONTAGNARD FOUNDATION, WE ASKED HOW HE WOULD </p><p>CHARACTERIZE IT.  HE RESPONDED THAT WHILE IT ADVOCATED </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS, THESE DAYS ITS POLITICAL AGENDA (AN </p><p>INDEPENDENT DEGA STATE) HAD THE UPPER HAND.  WHEN ASKED </p><p>HOW MUCH SUPPORT THERE WAS IN THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS FOR </p><p>AN INDEPENDENT DEGA STATE, THIS SOURCE SAID THAT WHILE </p><p>100 PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE SUPPORTED HUMAN RIGHTS, NOT </p><p>MORE THAN 30 PERCENT OF ETHNIC MINORITIES SUPPORTED A </p><p>SEPARATE STATE.  THIS LEADER DESCRIBED THE DEGA </p><p>PROTESTANTS AS USING RELIGION TO FURTHER THEIR </p><p>POLITICAL AGENDA.  WHILE EVERYONE SUPPORTS FREEDOM OF </p><p>RELIGION AND HUMAN RIGHTS, HE SAID, MOST OF THE PEOPLE </p><p>DO NOT SUPPORT USING THESE IDEAS TO WAGE A WAR AGAINST </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT. </p><p> </p><p>DOES ANYONE HAVE A MONOPOLY ON THE TRUTH? </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>19. (SBU) WE BELIEVE OUR TWO SOURCES ARE RELIABLE AND </p><p>PRESENTED INFORMATION THEY THOUGHT ACCURATE.  HOWEVER, </p><p>WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO CORROBORATE THE SECOND-HAND </p><p>REPORTS OF KILLINGS AT THE BORDER.  WHEN ASKED IF THEY </p><p>WOULD CHARACTERIZE WHAT HAPPENED WITH PROVINCIAL </p><p>CHRISTMAS SERVICES AS "NORMAL" OR "EXCEPTIONAL" </p><p>REPRESSION, THEY SAID THE WIDE RANGE OF OFFICIAL </p><p>ACTIONS WAS "NORMAL."  WHILE NEITHER LEADER SYMPATHIZED </p><p>WITH "DEGA" POLITICAL AIMS, THEY WERE CLEARLY CONCERNED </p><p>ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES.  THEY AGREED THAT PROVINCIAL </p><p>AUTHORITIES WANTED TO PREVENT RELIGIOUS SERVICES FROM </p><p>TAKING A POLITICAL TURN.  BUT AS THEIR ACCOUNTS </p><p>INDICATE, THE CHRISTMAS SITUATION VARIED FROM VILLAGE </p><p>TO VILLAGE IN THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS REGION.  THESE TWO </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HO CHI  00039  03 OF 03  151451Z </p><p>SOURCES DID NOT MAKE ANY OVERALL GENERALIZATIONS, AS </p><p>THEY ACKNOWLEDGED IT IS POSSIBLE FOR PEOPLE OF ONE </p><p>VILLAGE TO BE UNAWARE OF WHAT IS HAPPENING IN ANOTHER </p><p>VILLAGE JUST ONE KILOMETER DOWN THE SAME ROAD. </p><p> </p><p>YAMAUCHI </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
