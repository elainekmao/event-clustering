<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L BAGHDAD 03306 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS: PREL, IR, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: IRAN-IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) USUN 1615, (B) FBIS LD0606090990 </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  THE IRAQI MEDIA JUNE 7 HAS NOT REACTED TO </p><p>RAFSANJANI\'S JUNE 6 INTERVIEW IN WHICH HE </p><p>COMMENTS INTER ALIA ON THE POSSIBILITY OF </p><p>A MEETING WITH SADDAM (TEHRAN RADIO VERSION </p><p>IN REF B).  IN SUMMARY, RAFSANJANI SAID THE </p><p>POSSIBILITY OF SUCH A MEETING WILL DEPEND ON </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS AT THE EXPERT LEVEL AND "UNDER </p><p>THE SUPERVISION" OF THE SYG (TEHRAN RADIO) OR </p><p>"IN CONSULTATION WITH" THE SECRETARY GENERAL </p><p>(IRANIAN NEWS SERVICE). </p><p> </p><p>3.  RAFSANJANI(AND OTHER SENIOR IRANIANS EARLIER) </p><p>ALSO COMPLAINS ABOUT THE BAGHDAD SUMMIT COMMUNIQUE </p><p>REMARKS ON IRAN.  THE IRAQI MFA HAS TOLD US THAT </p><p>IT DOES NOT UNDERSTAND THIS ADVERSE IRANIAN REACTION, </p><p>SINCE THE COMMUNIQUE SIMPLY REITERATED THE LANGUAGE </p><p>OF THE CASABLANCA COMMUNIQUE, ADDING ONLY REFERENCE </p><p>TO SADDAM\'S RECENT "MESSAGE OF PEACE" TO IRAN. </p><p> </p><p>4.  ON JUNE 6, THE PALESTINIAN "AMBASSADOR" TO </p><p>IRAQ (FATAH) CONFIDED TO THE DUTCH AMBASSADOR THAT </p><p>THE FIRST SADDAM LETTER HAD BEEN CARRIED BY AN ARAFAT </p><p>EMISSARY TO TEHRAN.  RAFSANJANI\'S RESPONSE HAD </p><p>BEEN HANDED BY THE IRANIAN OIL MINISTER TO HIS </p><p>IRAQI COUNTERPART AT AN OPEC MEETING.  THE SECOND </p><p>SADDAM LETTER, HE ASSERTED, HAD ALSO MOVED DIRECTLY </p><p>FROM AN IRAQI TO AN IRANIAN. </p><p> </p><p>5.  WITHOUT MAKING CLEAR WHETHER HE HAD SEEN THE </p><p>LETTER HIMSELF, THE PALESTINIAN SAID THAT </p><p>SADDAM\'S FIRST MESSAGE HAD INVITED IRAN TO </p><p>LOOK TOWARD REESTABLISHING RELATIONS THROUGH </p><p>DIRECT NEGOTIATIONS AT THE SUMMIT, WITH AN </p><p>OPEN AGENDA, AND HAD NOTED THAT LIKE IRAN, IRAQ </p><p>IS THREATENED BY ISRAEL AND THE UNITED STATES. </p><p> </p><p>6.  FINALLY, THE PALESTINIAN CLAIMED THAT AN ARAFAT </p><p>ENVOY IS EVEN NOW CARRYING A PLO LETTER TO </p><p>RAFSANJANI, BUT THAT ARAFAT WOULD HIMSELF GO TO </p><p>TEHRAN ONLY IF TANGIBLE RESULTS OF MEDIATION WERE </p><p>IMMINENT; E.G., ON A POW EXCHANGE OR TO FIX </p><p>A DATE FOR IRAN-IRAQ TALKS. </p><p> </p><p>7.  COMMENT:  WE HAVE NOTED PRESS REPORTS THAT </p><p>ARAFAT IS NOT/NOT WELCOME IN TEHRAN NOR IS HIS </p><p>MEDIATION.  WE ALSO NOTE SPECULATION THAT </p><p>THE OMANIS HAVE BEEN CARRYING THE MESSAGES.  WE </p><p>CANNOT EVALUATE THE PALESTINIAN\'S COMMENTS, ALTHOUGH </p><p>WHY HE WOULD FABRICATE ALL THIS TO IMPRESS THE </p><p>DUTCH AMBASSADOR IS DIFFICULT TO FATHOM. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GLASPIE </p><p></p></div>
