<p>S E C R E T SANAA 001441 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/22/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PREL, PGOV, PINR, TERFIN </p><p>SUBJECT: ROYG APPEAL ON AL-MOAYED CASE </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. SECSTATE 175378 B. SANAA 1411 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: CDA ALAN G. MISENHEIMER FOR REASONS 1.5 (B)AND (D) </p><p> </p><p> 1.(S)  On 6/21, Polecon Chief delivered reftel response to </p><p>President Saleh\'s request for special consideration in the </p><p>extradition case of Mohammed al-Moayed to the Foreign </p><p>Minister\'s Office Director, Marwan Noman.  Noman promised to </p><p>forward the response immediately to Foreign Minister </p><p>al-Qirbi, who is traveling with President Saleh\'s party in </p><p>Germany.  (The Charge also gave the response directly by </p><p>telephone to Saleh\'s advisor, Mohammed Sudam, in Germany. </p><p>Septel.) </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) Noman repeated many of the points raised by FM </p><p>al-Qirbi in his 6/18 conversation with Charge (Ref B). </p><p>-  President Salih faces great pressure to save al-Moayed </p><p>from extradition to the U.S. </p><p>-  The pressure increased after media reports on the alleged </p><p>poor state of Al-Moayed\'s health and the isolation in which </p><p>he is confined by German authorities. </p><p>-  Many people fear that his treatment would be even worse in </p><p>the United States. </p><p>-  In these circumstances, President Saleh must do his best </p><p>for a deserving Yemeni citizen; people will be watching and </p><p>judging his efforts. </p><p>-  Therefore, Saleh authorized official funds for al-Moayed\'s </p><p>defense, is personnally appealing to the U.S. for a political </p><p>solution, and has scheduled meetings in Germany with top </p><p>officials to press the case. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Noman concluded with comments he described as purely </p><p>personal:  The al-Moayed case would bring "trouble no one </p><p>needs".  The U.S. should have brought its charges directly to </p><p>Yemeni authorities, rather than giving the perception that </p><p>al-Moayad had been "kidnapped" in Germany.   Finally, as a </p><p>lawyer himself, he thought the case was "very weak" because </p><p>it relied on a paid informer. PolEcon chief reminded Noman </p><p>that al-Moayed and his associate,  Mohammed Mohsen Yahya, are </p><p>answering the charges against them in a fair, impartial </p><p>German court. If extradition is granted, they will have every </p><p>opportunity to defend themselves in an equally fair American </p><p>court. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Comment: The al-Moayed case is a difficult issue for </p><p>the ROYG because it demonstrates its lack of international </p><p>influence. Saleh\'s last minute involvement may have been an </p><p>effort to show his good intentions to al-Moayed\'s supporters, </p><p>but they will portray his failure to deliver al-Moayed as </p><p>weakness. End Comment. </p><p>MISENHEIMER </p><p></p></div>
