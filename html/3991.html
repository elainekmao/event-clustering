<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 04 ABUJA 002862 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O.12958: DECL: 1.6X1, 1.6X6 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, KDEM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: VICE PRESIDENT ATIKU -- DISTANCING </p><p>HIMSELF FROM OBASANJO? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER. REASONS </p><p>1.6X1, 1.6X6. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (S) SUMMARY: During an October 10 meeting with </p><p>Ambassador Jeter, Vice President Atiku Abubakar </p><p>admitted his relationship with President Obasanjo was </p><p>on the shoals, attributing the deterioration to </p><p>Obasanjo\'s poor political skills and reliance on </p><p>malevolent, imprudent advisors. Atiku stated Obasanjo </p><p>had alienated Ibrahim Babangida, former military ruler </p><p>Abdulsalami Abubakar and NSA Aliyu Mohammmed, the men </p><p>most instrumental in Obasanjo\'s 1999 election. Atiku </p><p>disavowed supporting the impeachment drive but was not </p><p>working to quash it. The Vice President claimed </p><p>control of PDP party machinery, with only a small </p><p>faction loyal to Obasanjo. He saw reconciliation with </p><p>Obasanjo as unlikely. Yet, leaving an opening, Atiku </p><p>said that he, Babangida, Abdulsalami, and Aliyu would </p><p>meet the President that evening to see if fences could </p><p>be mended. Atiku spoke like a man fed up with a boss </p><p>he considered unskilled in the calling that he has </p><p>mastered. Candid about how his relationship with </p><p>Obasanjo had soured, Atiku did not reveal next steps, </p><p>but gave the impression that he was both able and </p><p>willing to contest for the Presidency. Atiku seemed to </p><p>be measuring whether the political aperture created by </p><p>Obasanjo\'s failings and the urging of others (such as </p><p>Babangida) for Atiku to step forward, was really the </p><p>opportunity of a lifetime or a trap to destroy him </p><p>politically. Some pundits and Babangida associates </p><p>claim that IBB may be setting Atiku up, in an effort </p><p>to destroy him politically, once and for all. Septel </p><p>will provide Embassy\'s analysis of Atiku\'s current </p><p>role in Nigerian politics and his prospects for the </p><p>future. End Summary </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>HOW IT BEGAN </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) During a ninety minute October 10 meeting at </p><p>the Vice President\'s residence, VP Atiku Abubakar told </p><p>Ambassador Jeter that his relationship with Obasanjo </p><p>was in tatters. Although tired and under the weather </p><p>due to the strain and pace of the last few weeks, </p><p>Atiku provided a detailed chronology of his </p><p>relationship with the President. Atiku said that he </p><p>and Obasanjo were relative strangers before the 1998 </p><p>prelude to the 1999 elections. Their nexus was the </p><p>late Shehu Yar A\'dua.  Yar A\'dua was second-in-command </p><p>during Obasanjo\'s stint as military Head of State. Yar </p><p>A\'dua was also Atiku\'s political mentor. Atiku </p><p>inherited leadership of Yar A\'dua\'s political machine, </p><p>the PDM, when the general died in detention, likely at </p><p>the sinister hand of the late Sani Abacha. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) Atiku recalled not only working for Obasanjo\'s </p><p>release from prison but also assisting in his ascent </p><p>to the Presidency. Atiku stated that he along with </p><p>former Heads of State Babangida and Abdulsalami and </p><p>current NSA Aliyu Mohammed were the four men most </p><p>responsible for Obasanjo\'s successful climb. Seeking </p><p>to redeem his image after the 1993 electoral debacle, </p><p>Babangida convinced Obasanjo to run, then placed his </p><p>considerable clout and money into the "Obasanjo </p><p>Project."  While Babangiba pulled the strings from </p><p>Minna, General Mohammed performed the much of the </p><p>legwork while also drumming up other support. Then </p><p>Head of State Abdulsalami backdated Obasanjo\'s pardon, </p><p>an act that allowed him to be eligible to contest in </p><p>the election. Abdulsalami also funneled money into the </p><p>campaign and steered the considerable powers of </p><p>incumbency to Obasanjo\'s favor. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Atiku\'s contribution was political. Exploiting </p><p>the PDM machinery, Atiku successfully engineered </p><p>Obasanjo\'s primary victories in the PDP. Along with </p><p>Babangida and the others, he recalled working hard to </p><p>ensure Obasanjo\'s nomination at the convention. It was </p><p>at that point, Obasanjo asked Atiku, already Adamawa </p><p>State\'s governor-elect and very content with that </p><p>status, to be his Vice-Presidential running mate. </p><p>Atiku accepted. On paper, Obasanjo had the credentials </p><p>of a perfect leader -- a perceived detribalized Yoruba </p><p>with ties to the North, a former military leader with </p><p>a good record, and good standing in the international </p><p>arena; but, in practice, he had fallen far too short </p><p>of the mark, Atiku lamented. (Comment: Atiku\'s version </p><p>of his selection differs from common lore. Most </p><p>accounts have a reluctant Obasanjo being pressured to </p><p>take Atiku because of need to cement the support of </p><p>the PDM faction of the party and to balance the ticket </p><p>with a running-mate from the North.  End comment) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>THINGS BEGAN TO SOUR -- ANENIH TO BLAME </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Although they did not know each other well, </p><p>Atiku recalled that the two quickly melded. However, </p><p>there was an early premonition that foreshadowed </p><p>today\'s troubles. Atiku recounted having agreed with </p><p>Obasanjo on whom they would back for the Senate </p><p>leadership. Shortly thereafter, Atiku went to the </p><p>United States only to discover Obasanjo had changed </p><p>heart, selecting another person for the Senate </p><p>President. According to Atiku, the shift was </p><p>precipitated by presidential advisors warning Obasanjo </p><p>that an Atiku loyalist should not be Senate President </p><p>because Atiku already had too much influence in the </p><p>Lower House. With one of his men as Senate President, </p><p>they warned that Atiku could engineer Obasanjo\'s </p><p>impeachment. Atiku stated that he acquiesced in the </p><p>change in order to avoid a confrontation with Obasanjo </p><p>so early in the Administration. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Atiku stated that the relationship with </p><p>Obasanjo assumed its current negative momentum in </p><p>April, during preparations for Obasanjo\'s reelection </p><p>announcement. Pointing the finger at Works and Housing </p><p>Minister Tony Anenih as the main culprit, Atiku </p><p>accused Obasanjo\'s "handlers" of purposefully </p><p>misinforming the President that he was angling to </p><p>announce his presidential bid before Obasanjo\'s was </p><p>announced. Obasanjo came to believe these innuendoes </p><p>when Atiku refused to participate in Anenih\'s </p><p>convoking of party figures at Obasanjo\'s farm in Ota </p><p>to "request" that Obasanjo run again.  Atiku claimed </p><p>that his absence did not signal opposition to the </p><p>President; instead, it underscored his distaste for a </p><p>procession he claimed was too reminiscent of the late </p><p>Sani Abacha\'s effort to succeed himself by casting </p><p>himself as a consensus candidate for civilian </p><p>President. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Atiku contended that Anenih attempted to keep </p><p>him ignorant of preparations for Obasanjo\'s reelection </p><p>announcement and tried to schedule the event when </p><p>Atiku was abroad. After talking to Obasanjo and </p><p>disavowing intentions to break the ticket, Atiku said </p><p>that Obasanjo ordered Anenih to stop his antics and </p><p>have Atiku participate in the reelection event. Still, </p><p>Atiku identified these machinations as causing a split </p><p>that in the intervening months has only worsened. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p>NO HAND IN THE IMPEACHMENT; NO HAND IN STOPPING IT </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) On the current impeachment crisis, Atiku </p><p>claimed the President was the victim of his own </p><p>hubris.  Because of Obasanjo\'s suspicions of his </p><p>influence in the Lower House, Atiku assiduously </p><p>avoided contact with its Members, letting the </p><p>President\'s other advisors work both Chambers. The </p><p>President\'s men quickly antagonized the </p><p>Representatives. Early on, Atiku remembered telling </p><p>Obasanjo that a close relationship with the Senate was </p><p>essential since his advisors had spoiled his </p><p>relationship with the House. Obasanjo erred in getting </p><p>involved in Senate President Anyim\'s tussle with the </p><p>Ebonyi State Governor over control of the party </p><p>machinery in that State; in doing so, Obasanjo lost </p><p>hold of the Senate. With both Houses alienated, </p><p>impeachment became possible. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (S) Atiku felt the overall aim was not to impeach </p><p>Obasanjo but to render him unelectable.  He disavowed </p><p>supporting the move.  With Obasanjo finally realizing </p><p>seriousness of the threat by late August, the </p><p>President asked Atiku to use his influence to calm the </p><p>waters at the National Assembly. Atiku responded that </p><p>he would meet House leaders provide Obasanjo\'s </p><p>advisors not savage him by claiming Atiku\'s meetings </p><p>with House leaders were signs of betrayal. Obasanjo </p><p>promised his advisors\' best behavior. Atiku met with </p><p>House leaders; as he feared, however, Obasanjo\'s </p><p>people accused him of backing the House rebellion. </p><p>Since then, Atiku claimed to have washed his hands of </p><p>the affair, leaving Obasanjo and his men to their own </p><p>devices. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>OBASANJO IN DIRE STRAITS IN THE PARTY </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Because of his lack of political skills, </p><p>Obasanjo has severely compromised his position in the </p><p>party. Atiku measured his strength in the PDP as </p><p>vastly superior to Obasanjo\'s, clearly suggesting that </p><p>Obasanjo would have a difficult time securing the </p><p>party nomination without him. At the PDP\'s most recent </p><p>National Executive Committee meeting, Obasanjo </p><p>suffered an embarrassing defeat when his proposal for </p><p>the sequencing of the party primaries was roundly </p><p>defeat by Atiku loyalists. Atiku claimed to have </p><p>passed a message to Obasanjo\'s men that they would </p><p>suffer more defeats if they tried to bypass him again </p><p>on preparations for the party convention and </p><p>primaries.  Atiku boasted that he held the loyalty of </p><p>most PDP governors, who generally control their state </p><p>party machines. He also contended that he controlled </p><p>the party NEC and that most PDP National Assembly </p><p>members were loyal to him. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) Atiku downplayed the potentially negative </p><p>effect of Obasanjo not gaining the party re- </p><p>nomination. Obasanjo, he asserted, did not have a </p><p>large constituency of his own. Thus, his ouster would </p><p>not convulse the party. Moreover, Obasanjo was not </p><p>very popular with his own ethnic kinsmen so the </p><p>Southwest would not erupt as it did with the annulment </p><p>of the 1993 election. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>THE BIG THREE ARE ALSO MAD AT OBASANJO </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (S) Perhaps more fatal to Obasanjo\'s chances than </p><p>his anemic support within the party, is the anger of </p><p>Babangida, Abdulsalami and Aliyu. Atiku claimed to be </p><p>in regular contact with the other three whom he </p><p>described as very disenchanted with Obasanjo. </p><p>Babangida has sworn off any association with a second </p><p>"Obasanjo Project," an allusion to their cooperation </p><p>to elect Obasanjo in 1999. Abdulsalami was miffed when </p><p>he came to ask Obasanjo for a favor and the </p><p>President\'s response was to show him the door. </p><p>Realizing Obasanjo was digging a hole for himself, </p><p>Atiku once asked the President if he really understood </p><p>how he had won office. He warned Obasanjo that it was </p><p>akin to political suicide to insult these men by </p><p>telling them they had made a "bad investment" if they </p><p>expected favors due to their contributions to his </p><p>election. When Obasanjo pleaded ignorance as to the </p><p>role of the Big Three in his election, Atiku proceeded </p><p>to summarize the contributions they and he had made. </p><p>When the President continued to feign ignorance and </p><p>asked how he could reconcile with the others, Atiku </p><p>said he admonished the President for being ungrateful </p><p>and he knew very well that he had to make amends for </p><p>past behavior. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (S) While in Abuja for the September 23 </p><p>Commonwealth meeting on Zimbabwe, South African </p><p>President Mbeki expressed concern about Nigeria\'s </p><p>internal politics. Previously, Obasanjo had dismissed </p><p>his troubles as a teapot\'s tempest; this time, he </p><p>admitted to Mbeki that he was in serious trouble. </p><p>However, when Mbeki tried to meet Atiku, Obasanjo </p><p>invited himself to the session and placed Mbeki and </p><p>Atiku in an uncomfortable and embarrassing situation </p><p>Atiku said that he choose to leave.  However, before </p><p>Mbeki departed, he and Atiku managed to talk outside </p><p>of Obasanjo\'s earshot, with the VP speaking frankly </p><p>about the President\'s political mistakes. Atiku told </p><p>us that Mbeki wanted to talk to Babangida as well. In </p><p>the end, Babangida traveled to South Africa with </p><p>Obasanjo\'s consent. Mbeki\'s apparent motive was to </p><p>patch what was broken but Atiku did not give the </p><p>venture much chance, particularly given Babangida\'s </p><p>position. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. (S) Atiku said the President\'s Chief of Staff had </p><p>admitted that Obasanjo was desperate.  In fact, the </p><p>meeting with Ambassador Jeter was interrupted by </p><p>several phone calls from the President\'s Office to </p><p>arrange a dinner that evening for Obasanjo, Atiku and </p><p>the Big Three, with Babangida having returned that day </p><p>from South Africa. Atiku said that for months he had </p><p>kept the Big Three from breaking openly with Obasanjo. </p><p>He reminded them that they had enlisted his support </p><p>for Obasanjo. He then told them that since they had </p><p>backed Obasanjo together, they all must stick with him </p><p>or leave him together. While that argument held things </p><p>in abeyance, the day of decision was near. In a recent </p><p>conversation, Abdulsalami cautioned Atiku about </p><p>hitching his political future to Obasanjo\'s, the Vice </p><p>President explained. (Comment: It seems unlikely that </p><p>Obasanjo would have been in haste to hold the dinner </p><p>without a signal from his friend Mbeki that what </p><p>Babangida would say would not be too difficult to </p><p>swallow. However, Mbeki could have misread Babangida. </p><p>It would not be the first or last time someone </p><p>misinterpreted Babangida\'s next steps.  End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15. (S) Atiku stated his rumored antagonisms with </p><p>Aliyu and Babangida were media fabrications.  He </p><p>stated Aliyu respected his political clout; in any </p><p>case, the two operated in different spheres with Aliyu </p><p>more at home on foreign policy and national security </p><p>issues. As for Babangida, the former Head of State was </p><p>encouraging him to run. Atiku, however, would not </p><p>reveal his next moves, but did tell the Ambassador </p><p>that he could "put two and two together."  He </p><p>acknowledged the potential turmoil and paralysis of </p><p>government that could result should he and Obasanjo </p><p>battled for the PDP nomination. Atiku cryptically said </p><p>he would do all he could to avoid these negative </p><p>developments but stopped far short of disavowing </p><p>presidential ambitions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16. (S) As the meeting ended, Atiku informed the </p><p>Ambassador the meeting with Obasanjo was confirmed for </p><p>that evening. Before going to the Presidential Villa, </p><p>he and the Big Three would huddle to determine whether </p><p>to walk away from Obasanjo or give him one more </p><p>chance, spelling out concrete conditions for keeping </p><p>their support. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>17. (S) While definitely shaped by his own biases, </p><p>many of Atiku\'s observations ring true. Obasanjo is </p><p>crippled politically, having alienated many of his </p><p>former supporters. From almost all accounts, Atiku </p><p>does command more loyalty within the party than </p><p>Obasanjo. However, Atiku\'s self-portrait as a loyal </p><p>but unjustly accused and wounded subordinate is </p><p>exaggerated. There have been constant and credible </p><p>reports for nearly a year that have Atiku testing the </p><p>Presidential waters. He considers himself a much </p><p>better politician that Obasanjo, and he most certainly </p><p>is. Atiku also believes that Obasanjo has sufficiently </p><p>fouled his own nest with little chance and dwindling </p><p>time to rehabilitate his status.  First, to win the </p><p>re-nomination, Obasanjo needs the Big Three to </p><p>exercise benign indifference if they can no longer </p><p>support him.  Additionally, Obasanjo will need Atiku\'s </p><p>active support, something that Atiku currently appears </p><p>more than content to withhold. It appears that Atiku </p><p>is standing by watching Obasanjo progressively weaken </p><p>and gauging the best time to make an aggressive move. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>18. (C) However, before laying his cards on the table, </p><p>Atiku must decide whether the encouragement given by </p><p>Babangida and others is real or are they simply using </p><p>his own ambition to entice him into a battle with </p><p>Obasanjo in hopes that they will neutralize each </p><p>other.  Interestingly, in a private meeting on October </p><p>15, the APP Governor of Gombe State, an IBB loyalist </p><p>and former Minister in Babangida\'s government, told </p><p>the Ambassador that Babangida had been working for </p><p>almost two years to drive a wedge between Obasanjo and </p><p>Atiku.  Atiku, he said, would probably run for the </p><p>Presidency and Babangida would destroy him; once and </p><p>for all.  Perhaps the Machiavelli-like "evil genius" </p><p>has struck again.  We shall see. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
