<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L OTTAWA 001323 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/09/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KNNP, KN, CA </p><p>SUBJECT: NORTH KOREAN REPROCESSING: CANADA WILL RAISE </p><p>CONCERNS WITH DPRK </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 114597 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Minister Counselor Brian Flora, </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Canada shares our strong concerns about North Korean </p><p>statements on reprocessing spent fuel (reftel), and plans to </p><p>convey those concerns directly to DPRK officials at the UN </p><p>and in Beijing.  Political Director Jim Wright told Political </p><p>Minister Counselor on May 7 that he will also suggest that </p><p>Foreign Minister Graham make a public statement about </p><p>Canadian concerns in connection with the G-8 Foreign </p><p>Ministers meeting in Paris later this month.  The South </p><p>Korean Ambassador had met with Wright earlier that day, and </p><p>asked how the G-8 meetings in Paris and Evian would deal with </p><p>North Korea.  In preparation for the G-8, Wright asked if we </p><p>could provide him readouts on the Roh and Koizumi visits to </p><p>Washington as well as reactions to our demarche in other </p><p>capitals. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Wright said that Canada has exactly the same objective </p><p>as the U.S. for North Korea - a complete, verifiable, and </p><p>irreversible termination of the nuclear program.  He worried </p><p>that the verification regime put in place in the 1990s, which </p><p>was the best we could do at the time, hadn\'t been sufficient. </p><p> Wright asked if we have seen any physical evidence yet that </p><p>reprocessing has started back up.  He had seen intelligence </p><p>reports on activity around the Yongbyon facility, but </p><p>wondered if there was more. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Wright also said that Canada would continue to push in </p><p>multilateral fora to bring pressure to bear on the DPRK.  He </p><p>noted that the Canadian delegation to the NPT PrepCom was </p><p>encouraging other delegations to be more vocal on North </p><p>Korea.  The Canadian team had been asked by the Hungarian </p><p>Chair to draft a factual summary of proceedings, which they </p><p>were doing.  He noted that this was not ideal, but was </p><p>probably the best outcome possible as divergent views on </p><p>North Korea precluded a meaningful declaration. </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
