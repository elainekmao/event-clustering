<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 000744 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR INR/R/MR, I/RW, I/REC; PA </p><p>SA/INS(FOR JWALLER); SA/PD (FOR LJIRWIN, LSCENSNY, </p><p>WREINCKENS); SSA/PAB </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, OPRC, KMDR, OIIP, CE </p><p>SUBJECT:  MEDIA PLAY -- EMBASSY COLOMBO EMPLOYEES INDICTED </p><p>ON VISA FRAUD CHARGES </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. On 5/2 Colombo\'s Administrative Officer and her husband, </p><p>who had been employed by the mission as a Consular </p><p>Associate, were indicted on visa fraud and alien smuggling </p><p>charges.  PD issued a press release regarding the </p><p>indictments, noting that they were the result of an 11- </p><p>month investigation.  The release also announced that the </p><p>Consulate in Colombo would close temporarily "for a </p><p>thorough review of operations," and concluded by noting </p><p>that "the illegal issuance of U.S. visas is a serious crime </p><p>that threatens American borders and the national security </p><p>of the United States.  The Department of State maintains </p><p>extensive programs to combat vigorously visa fraud and </p><p>investigates all allegations of such criminal activity." </p><p>For full text of the press release see para. 4. </p><p> </p><p>2. Sri Lanka\'s dailies and weekenders gave the story </p><p>prominent coverage.  On 5/3 the front pages included </p><p>headlines such as "Visa scandal rocks U.S. Embassy" (DAILY </p><p>MIRROR, independent English daily), "Visa fraud and alien </p><p>human trafficking -- two former officers of U.S. Embassy </p><p>indicted" (DINAMINA, government-owned Sinhala daily), and </p><p>"Consular section of U.S. Embassy in Colombo closed" </p><p>(THINAKARAN, government-owned Tamil daily).  The 5/4 </p><p>weekenders continued with headlines like "Two American </p><p>Officials indicted for issuance of illegal visas" (SUNDAY </p><p>LAKBIMA, independent Sinhala weekender), "Lanka transit </p><p>point for big U.S. visa scam" (SUNDAY TIMES, independent </p><p>English weekender), and "Visa fraud at U.S. Embassy" </p><p>(VIRAKESARI, independent Tamil weekender).  5/3 coverage </p><p>was based on post\'s press release; by 5/4 wire service and </p><p>local reports had come into play. </p><p> </p><p>3. Despite two days of heavy, front-page coverage, only one </p><p>Sri Lankan daily chose to editorialize on the issue.  On </p><p>5/4, under the headline "The visa scandal," the SUNDAY </p><p>ISLAND (independent English weekender) lamented the price </p><p>that "genuine travelers have to pay ... for the actions of </p><p>cheats and frauds" that oblige consular offices to "enforce </p><p>preventive measures" that "mean hardship to honest people." </p><p>It called on consular officers to apply "rules and </p><p>regulations ... justly and humanely," saying that "one way </p><p>of attracting graft is to make getting a visa ... very </p><p>difficult...."  The ISLAND closed its comment by calling </p><p>the incident "an opportunity to blow the whistle.  The </p><p>State Department `maintains extensive programs to combat </p><p>vigorously visa frauds and investigates all allegations of </p><p>such criminal activity,\' the embassy said.  Those who have </p><p>benefited from such visas are not likely to squeal.  The </p><p>deprived might, though, now that complaints have been </p><p>implicitly invited." </p><p> </p><p>4. Text of Embassy Colombo\'s 5/2 press release follows: </p><p> </p><p>"Former U.S. embassy employees indicted on visa fraud </p><p>charges </p><p> </p><p>"Two former employees of the U.S. Embassy in Colombo, Sri </p><p>Lanka, A. C. Robert Johnson and Long N. Lee, were indicted </p><p>on Friday, May 2, in the U.S. District Court in Sacramento, </p><p>California, on charges relating to visa fraud and alien </p><p>smuggling.  Seven other individuals also were indicted in </p><p>connection with this case.  No other American staff at the </p><p>Embassy are suspected of involvement. </p><p> </p><p>"These indictments are the result of an 11-month </p><p>investigation conducted by the Diplomatic Security Service, </p><p>the U.S. Embassy in Colombo, the FBI, the U.S. Attorney\'s </p><p>Office in Sacramento, California, the Department of </p><p>Justice, and Sri Lankan authorities.  Law enforcement </p><p>officials received valuable assistance from the Bureau of </p><p>Consular Affairs in this investigation. </p><p> </p><p>"In order to ensure the integrity of the U.S. visa and the </p><p>visa issuance process, the U.S. Ambassador to Sri Lanka, E. </p><p>Ashley Wills, has decided to close the Consulate </p><p>temporarily to all but emergency services for a thorough </p><p>review of operations.  The Consulate is expected to reopen </p><p>within a few days. </p><p> </p><p>"The illegal issuance of U.S. visas is a serious crime that </p><p>threatens American borders and the national security of the </p><p>United States.   The Department of State maintains </p><p>extensive programs to combat vigorously visa fraud and </p><p>investigates all allegations of such criminal activity. </p><p> </p><p>"As this case is now before the courts, we are not able to </p><p>provide further information at this time." </p><p> </p><p>Wills </p><p></p></div>
