<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 000551 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS, S/CT; NSC FOR </p><p>E. MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:   DECL: 04-01-13 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, MOPS, CE, NO, JA, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  GSL considering a referendum re federalism </p><p>later this year; Tigers suspected in another sea attack </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  Colombo 543, and previous </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador E. Ashley Wills. </p><p>Reasons: 1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY:  In a March 29 conversation with the </p><p>Ambassador, Minister Moragoda said the GSL was thinking </p><p>of holding a referendum on federalism later this year. </p><p>He commented that the PM believed the referendum idea </p><p>could be a way to place opponents of the GSL\'s peace </p><p>initiative on the defensive.  Moragoda also said a </p><p>report re the security zones in Jaffna will soon be out. </p><p>In other developments, the Tigers have apparently struck </p><p>again, attacking a navy ship late March 31.  In our </p><p>view, a referendum may be a way to move the peace </p><p>process forward, but it needs careful planning or it </p><p>could backfire.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>Possible Referendum </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The Ambassador spoke March 29 with Milinda </p><p>Moragoda, the Minister of Economic Reform and a key </p><p>player in the Sri Lankan government on peace issues. </p><p>Moragoda mentioned that the GSL is considering holding a </p><p>peace-related referendum possibly in the September </p><p>timeframe.  The preliminary thinking is that the </p><p>referendum would allow Sri Lankans to vote on whether </p><p>they approve of a federalist-type negotiated solution to </p><p>the conflict.  The exact wording of the referendum has </p><p>not been put together yet, Moragoda remarked, and would </p><p>hinge in large part on the status of GSL discussions </p><p>with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) on the </p><p>federalism issue.  (Note:  The discussions re federalism </p><p>only kicked off at the sixth round of talks held last </p><p>month and are in their embryonic stage -- See Reftels.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Re the potential political ramifications of such </p><p>a move, Moragoda commented that Prime Minister </p><p>Wickremesinghe felt that such a referendum, if it was </p><p>handled correctly, could win overwhelmingly.  It would </p><p>also have the benefit of placing anti-peace process </p><p>elements in the south of the country on the defensive. </p><p>The referendum process itself, Moragoda noted, is a </p><p>relatively simple and straightforward one:  All the </p><p>government needs is a majority in Parliament to approve </p><p>the text and it can then be taken to the public for a </p><p>vote. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>Report re Security Zones </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Moragoda also mentioned that a long-awaited </p><p>report re the Sri Lankan government\'s controversial </p><p>"high security zones" in Jaffna has been given to the </p><p>GSL.  (Note:  The zones cover about 18 percent of the </p><p>land area of Jaffna District.  The LTTE and many Tamils </p><p>have demanded that the zones be drastically decreased in </p><p>size, but the military says it needs the zones for </p><p>defensive purposes -- see Reftels.)  The report was </p><p>drafted by Satish Nambiar, a retired Indian general, who </p><p>visited Sri Lanka earlier this year to assess the </p><p>situation in Jaffna.  Moragoda said the report, which </p><p>the government was reviewing, was quite elaborate in </p><p>that it provided for large-scale monitoring, including </p><p>of heavy weapons, and for the shifting and consolidation </p><p>of troops.  Nambiar is due to visit Sri Lanka in late </p><p>April to discuss the report with the government and the </p><p>LTTE.  (Note:  The fact that the report is ready and has </p><p>been given to the GSL is close-hold, and has not hit the </p><p>press yet.  Mission has not yet seen a copy of the </p><p>report, although Moragoda said he would try to get us </p><p>one.) </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>Another Sea Attack </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) In another peace process-related development, </p><p>the LTTE\'s sea wing has apparently struck again.  The </p><p>Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission (SLMM) has confirmed that </p><p>several small boats fired upon a Sri Lankan naval </p><p>transport vessel in waters just north of Trincomalee </p><p>port late March 31.  The attack left up to three sailors </p><p>injured, one seriously.  The ship, which was carrying </p><p>1,500 soldiers, was not seriously damaged and was </p><p>reportedly able to continue its voyage to Jaffna.  The </p><p>SLMM reports that naval personnel fired back and the </p><p>navy believed that one of the small boats may have been </p><p>sunk.  The SLMM could not confirm the claim. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) The SLMM is investigating the incident and </p><p>reports that the LTTE has denied involvement in the </p><p>attack in categorical terms.  Observers we have spoken </p><p>to believe that the LTTE\'s claim is ludicrous on its </p><p>face.  They assert that the group is almost certainly </p><p>responsible for the attack, as the use of small boats in </p><p>lightning raids fits the Sea Tigers\' modus operandi </p><p>perfectly.  The attack also took place very near Sea </p><p>Tiger bases on the northeast coast. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) (((Note:  There have been other incidents </p><p>recently in the same general area off the northeast </p><p>coast:  On March 20, for example, unidentified small </p><p>boats attacked a Chinese fishing trawler in waters near </p><p>the LTTE-controlled town of Mullaitivu.  The boat sank, </p><p>with the loss of 17 crew.  As with the latest incident, </p><p>the Tigers denied involvement.  In its recently released </p><p>report about the March 20 incident, the SLMM admitted </p><p>that it could not come to any conclusion about what </p><p>happened, with all sides denying they had instigated the </p><p>attack.  In private, SLMM contacts have told us they </p><p>thought the LTTE was responsible.  End Note.))) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) We are not sure how serious the GSL is about the </p><p>referendum idea.  It may be a trial balloon (there have </p><p>been some press articles mentioning the idea in general </p><p>terms of late).  That said, a referendum could prove a </p><p>way to move the peace process forward if it is put </p><p>together carefully.  A big win in a referendum, for </p><p>example, could provide the GSL\'s peace initiative </p><p>significant momentum.  At the same time, the government </p><p>must mull over the matter very carefully.  If something </p><p>goes wrong, the GSL\'s plans could backfire and the peace </p><p>process suffer possibly irreparable harm.  In any case, </p><p>we expect that government insiders will debate this </p><p>issue for some time before making a final decision on </p><p>whether to go forward. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) Re the March 31 sea attack, we believe that the </p><p>Sea Tigers are almost certainly the culpable party.  As </p><p>we have reported, the Sea Tigers are apparently on a </p><p>hair trigger, waiting for the right opportunity to </p><p>strike back at the Sri Lankan navy over the sinking of a </p><p>LTTE resupply ship last month (see Reftels).  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
