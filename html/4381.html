SUMMARY: GREEK COTTON PRODUCTION IS </p><p>SUSTAINED BY EU PRICE SUPPORTS WHICH VARY </p><p>ACCORDING TO OVERALL PRODUCTION TARGETS. </p><p>BECAUSE OF OVERPRODUCTION IN THREE OF THE </p><p>LAST FIVE YEARS, THE AVERAGE PRICE PAID FOR </p><p>SEED COTTON HAS VARIED FROM 62.50 EUROS PER </p><p>100 KG TO 88.0 EUROS PER 100 KG. </p><p> </p><p>2.  KEY SUPPORT FOR GREECE\'S COTTON </p><p>PRODUCTION IS THE EU COTTON REGIME.  EU </p><p>REGULATIONS 1051/2001 AND 1591/2001 SET NEW </p><p>POLICIES AND MEASURES FOR PREVENTING </p><p>OVERPRODUCTION OF EU COTTON AND NEW </p><p>CORESPONSIBILITY.   THE LATTER IS THE </p><p>MECHANISM (LEVY) FOR PENALIZING COTTON </p><p>PRODUCERS FOR EXCEEDING A TARGET.  THE </p><p>MAXIMUM PRODUCTION LEVEL WAS SET AT 1,031,000 </p><p>MT OF RAW COTTON (SEED COTTON). WHENEVER </p><p>PRODUCTION EXCEEDS THIS LEVEL, THE TARGET </p><p>PRICE IS REDUCED FOR BOTH STATES, GREECE AND </p><p>SPAIN, AS DESCRIBED IN ARTICLE 3, PARAGRAPH 1 </p><p>OF THE REGULATION NO.1051 IN CHAPTER II </p><p>(UNDER PRICE MECHANISMS). </p><p> </p><p>3. IN 2001 GREEK COTTON PRODUCTION  EXCEEDED </p><p>THE QUOTA BY ALMOST 200,000 MT (RAW COTTON </p><p>BASIS.) CONSEQUENTLY, HIGH PENALTIES WERE </p><p>IMPOSED BY THE EU ON FARMERS, REDUCING THEIR </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  05601  01 OF 02  210247Z </p><p>TARGET PRICE BY OVER 20 PERCENT. </p><p> </p><p>4. IN MAY 2001 THE GOG OFFERED SUGGESTIONS TO </p><p>COTTON FARMING GROUPS ON WAYS TO CONTINUE </p><p>FARMING BUT TO REDUCE COTTON ACREAGE. THIS </p><p>ADVICE WENT LARGELY UNHEEDED.  NO INCENTIVE </p><p>OTHER THAN THE USUAL EU PAYMENT WAS OFFERED. </p><p>THIS ACTION PROVED TO BE UNSUCCESSFUL AND </p><p>BOTH THE GOG AND FARMERS WERE DISAPPOINTED TO </p><p>SAY THE LEAST. HOWEVER, IN 2002 A REDUCTION </p><p>OF COTTON ACREAGE BY 25,000 HA TOOK PLACE, </p><p>CAUSED BY THE \'DOCKING\' OF PRICES PAID OUT </p><p>FOR THE RECORD HIGH GREEK 2001 HARVEST. THIS </p><p>YEAR\'S (2003 HARVEST) OUTPUT IS EXPECTED TO </p><p>REACH APPROXIMATELY 1,000,000 MT (WITHIN THE </p><p>QUOTA), COMPARED TO A 2001 CROP OF 1,350,000 </p><p>MT (RAW BASIS).  ACREAGE FOREGONE FROM COTTON </p><p>WAS UTILIZED FOR DURUM WHEAT, CORN, ALFALFA </p><p>AND FORAGE PLANT CROPS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  ALL COTTON CROP ACREAGE IN GREECE IS </p><p>IRRIGATED. FARMERS PAY A FLAT FEE OF 120 </p><p>EUROS PER HECTARE/YEAR REGARDLESS OF HOW MUCH </p><p>WATER THEY CONSUME.  ON-FARM USE OF FUEL ALSO </p><p>IS SUBSIDIZED AT A DISCOUNT OF 10-15 PERCENT </p><p>UNDER MARKET PRICES. </p><p> </p><p>6. A 5-YEAR (MARKETING YEAR) SERIES ON FARM </p><p>GATE PRICES FOR RAW COTTON IN EUROS/LOO KG IS </p><p>SHOWN BELOW.

FOR SEVERAL YEARS THE GOG HAS </p><p>UNSUCCESSFULLY PETITIONED BRUSSELS TO </p><p>INCREASE THE COTTON PRODUCTION QUOTA THE GOG </p><p>ARGUED THAT THE EU SHOULD ATTEMPT TO COVER </p><p>"PRAGMATIC" ACREAGE PLANTED TO COTTON TO </p><p>SUPPORT FARM INCOME. THE COMMISSION HAS </p><p>REJECTED ALL SUCH REQUESTS. TO THE CONTRARY, </p><p>UNDER THE COTTON REFORM OF MAY 2001 THE EU </p><p>HAS CHANGED BASIC REGULATIONS PERTAINING TO </p><p>COTTON CULTIVATION AND HAS IMPOSED STRICTER </p><p>PENALTIES FOR OVERPRODUCTION. </p><p> </p><p>8.
