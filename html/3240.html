<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001567 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PD, AF/S, AF/RA </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, KPAO, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: GOVERNMENT OP-ED CRITICIZES BUSH PLAN TO </p><p>VISIT AFRICA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   An op-ed published in the June 27 edition of the </p><p>      government-controlled daily "The Herald," dismisses </p><p>      President Bush\'s planned visit to Africa next year as </p><p>      a "non-event."  Under headline "Bush\'s visit a non- </p><p>      event: West should stop meddling in Africa\'s internal </p><p>      affairs," the newspaper\'s special assignments writer, </p><p>      Tim Chigodo, reports: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   "Very few Africans will find excitement and joy </p><p>      in the proposed visit to the continent by American </p><p>      President George W. Bush following his hard-line </p><p>      stance on Third World states. . . Analysts say the US </p><p>      and Britain cannot lecture Africans on democracy. </p><p>      Both countries were too directly involved in the slave </p><p>      trade to be capable of selfless contribution on the </p><p>      subject.  They have their hands, historically, </p><p>      dripping with the incalculable suffering of black </p><p>      people. . .  Observers say the US as the most powerful </p><p>      nation in the world, should concentrate on various </p><p>      aspects of poverty reduction, debt relief, </p><p>      globalization and war against HIV/AIDS which is </p><p>      reducing life expectancy in Africa instead of meddling </p><p>      in the internal affairs of the country. . .  There is </p><p>      no doubt that most Africans, including Zimbabweans, </p><p>      will treat the visit by the American leader as a damp </p><p>      squid.  It is very clear that the West still holds </p><p>      paternalistic and imperialistic attitudes towards </p><p>      Africa." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
