(COMMENT: SAMBI EARLIER EXPRESSED </p><p>CONCERN ABOUT THE FALL OFF IN PILGRIMS AND TOURISTS </p><p>IMPACTING ECONOMICALLY ON PALESTINIANS, BOTH MOSLEM AND </p><p>CHRISTIAN.

(COMMENT: THE VATICAN AND </p><p>THE APOSTOLIC CHURCH IN ARMENIA ENJOY EXCELLENT </p><p>RELATIONS. THE POPE AND THE FORMER CATHOLICOS (LEADER) </p><p>HAD DEVELOPED A WARM FRIENDSHIP. THEOLOGICAL DISPUTES </p><p>BETWEEN CATHOLICS AND APOSTOLIC ARMENIANS WERE RESOLVED </p><p>IN 1996. FULL UNITY BETWEEN THE TWO CHURCHES WOULD BE A </p><p>COUP FOR THE VATICAN AND A GOAL WHICH WILL GOAD THE </p><p>VATICAN TO MAKE FURTHER PRO-ARMENIAN POLITICAL </p><p>STATEMENTS. OTHER ORTHODOX CHURCHES ARE LIKELY TO FOLLOW </p><p>CLOSELY THE OUTCOME OF SUCH A "TEST CASE." END COMMENT). </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>BLURRING OF CHURCH-STATE SEPARATION </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.   THE VATICAN HAS DEFENDED STEPPING INTO THE ITALIAN </p><p>POLITICAL ARENA BY SAYING ITALIAN POLITICIANS REQUESTED </p><p>CONSULTATIONS WITH ITS OFFICIALS. VATICAN SECRETARY OF </p><p>STATE, CARDINAL ANGELO SODANO, HAS RECEIVED LEADERS FROM </p><p>LEFT AND RIGHT WING POLITICAL PARTIES. HE CLAIMED THE </p><p>VATICAN "LIMITED ITSELF" TO EXPLAINING ITS POSITION ON </p><p>MORAL AND SOCIAL ISSUES. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>VATICAN SUPPORTS BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH "WITHIN LIMITS" </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>6.   THE VATICAN\'S TOP BIOMEDICAL EXPERT, BISHOP ELIO </p><p>SGRECCIA, SAYS HE SUPPORTS BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH. IN AN </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  01286  02 OF 02  072228Z </p><p>INTERVIEW WITH VATICAN RADIO, SGRECCIA SAID THE VATICAN </p><p>APPRECIATES AND ENCOURAGES SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH WHEN IT IS </p><p>GEARED TOWARDS "THE PREVENTION AND HEALING OF ILLNESSES </p><p>AND THE RELIEF OF HUMAN SUFFERING." THE BISHOPS STRESSED </p><p>THAT RESEARCH AND EXPERIMENTATION MUST SHOW RESPECT FOR </p><p>ALL HUMAN LIFE FROM CONCEPTION TO NATURAL DEATH, AND </p><p>ESPECIALLY WHEN SUBJECTS ARE UNABLE TO CONSENT TO </p><p>PROCEDURES. BISHOP SGRECCIA REAFFIRMED THE VATICAN\'S </p><p>OPPOSITION TO THE USE OF FETAL STEM CELLS FOR RESEARCH </p><p>UNLESS THE CELLS CAME FROM SPONTANEOUSLY ABORTED FETUSES. </p><p>THE VATICAN ACCEPTS RESEARCH USING STEM CELLS TAKEN FROM </p><p>THE UMBILICAL CORD OF NEWBORN INFANTS AND FROM ADULTS. </p><p>SGRECCIA SAID THE VATICAN ALSO SUPPORTS BIOTECHNOLOGY AS </p><p>LONG AS PROPER SAFEGUARDS ARE MAINTAINED, CONSUMERS </p><p>INFORMED OF MODIFIED ORGANISMS IN THEIR FOOD AND ECONOMIC </p><p>ADVANTAGES SHARED. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>NO RED HATS FOR EASTERN-RITE CARDINALS </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.   IN A SIGN OF RESPECT FOR EASTERN-RITE CHURCHES </p><p>UNITED TO ROME, THREE NEW CARDINALS DID NOT RECEIVE THE </p><p>TRADITIONAL RED "BEANIES" AND BRIM-LESS "BIRETTAS" DURING </p><p>A FEBRUARY 21 VATICAN CITY CEREMONY. THE MODIFICATION OF </p><p>THE CEREMONY REFLECTS CURRENT VATICAN POLICY TOWARDS </p><p>ANCIENT NON-ROMAN CATHOLIC COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE UNIQUE </p><p>RITUALS, LANGUAGE AND TRADITIONS. ONE OF THE NEW </p><p>CARDINALS AND HEAD OF THE VATICAN OFFICE FOR EASTERN </p><p>CHURCHES, SYRIAN PATRIARCH MOUSSA DAOUD SAID NOT </p><p>RECEIVING THE RED HAT SIGNIFIED THAT THE ORIENTAL-RITE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  01286  02 OF 02  072228Z </p><p>CARDINALS CONTINUE TO BE LINKED TO THEIR LOCAL CHURCHES </p><p>AND DO NOT BECOME MEMBERS OF THE CLERGY OF ROME. (NOTE: </p><p>CARDINALS ARE TRADITIONALLY MEMBERS OF THE ROMAN CLERGY. </p><p>"NON-ROMAN" CARDINALS ARE GIVEN TITLE TO ONE OF ROME\'S </p><p>CHURCHES ALTHOUGH THIS WAS NOT THE CASE FOR THE NEW </p><p>CARDINAL-PATRIARCHS FROM SYRIA AND EGYPT. THE UKRAINIAN </p><p>EASTERN-RITE CARDINAL IS A MONK. HE DID NOT RECEIVE A RED </p><p>HAT, BUT WAS GIVEN TITLE TO ONE OF ROME\'S CHURCHES. END </p><p>NOTE).
