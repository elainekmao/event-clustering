(C) SUMMARY. GOI OFFICIALS BELIEVE THAT AS EU PRESIDENT, </p><p>ITALY\'S TOUGHEST ECONOMIC CHALLENGE WILL BE TO HELP RESTORE </p><p>CONSUMER AND INVESTOR CONFIDENCE IN THE MARKETS.  A CREDIBLE </p><p>MESSAGE BY THE ITALIAN PRESIDENCY AND COMMITMENT BY ALL EU </p><p>MEMBERS TO JUMP-START EURO-ZONE ECONOMIES ARE NEEDED TO WIN </p><p>BACK CONFIDENCE, MFA AND FINANCE MINISTRY OFFICIALS TOLD </p><p>VISITING PRINCIPAL DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY RIES DURING A </p><p>MAY 19TH ROUNDTABLE DINNER DISCUSSION.  THE GOI ALSO WILL </p><p>SEEK A STRONG US/EU COMMON STATEMENT IN SUPPORT OF THE DOHA </p><p>TRADE ROUND PRIOR TO THE CANCUN MEETING, FOLLOWED BY A </p><p>SUCCESSFUL MEETING ITSELF.  ALSO DISCUSSED WERE THE </p><p>POSSIBILITY OF REVITALIZING THE TRANSATLANTIC BUSINESS </p><p>DIALOGUE, ITALY\'S E-GOVERNMENT PLANS, TRADE ISSUES AND THE </p><p>MID-TERM REVIEW OF THE COMMON AGRICULTURAL PROGRAM.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) PARTICIPATING IN THE DCM-HOSTED DINNER FOR PDAS RIES </p><p>WERE LORENZO BINI-SMAGHI, DIRECTOR GENERAL (AND G7 FINANCIAL </p><p>SOUS-SHERPA) OF THE FINANCE MINISTRY; GIANDOMENICO MAGLIANO, </p><p>THE NEW DIRECTOR GENERAL, OFFICE OF ECONOMIC COOPERATION, </p><p>MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS; AMEDEO TETI, DIRECTOR GENERAL, </p><p>COMMERCIAL AGREEMENTS, MINISTRY OF PRODUCTIVE ACTIVITIES </p><p>(TRADE); STEFANO GATTI, DIPLOMATIC ADVISOR TO THE MINISTER OF </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  02294  01 OF 03  230857Z </p><p>TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION, AND RAFFAELE DE LUTIO, DIPLOMATIC </p><p>ADVISOR TO THE MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE, AND FOR THE U.S., THE </p><p>ECONOMIC MINISTER COUNSELOR, AGRICULTURAL MINISTER COUNSELOR </p><p>AND ECONOFF (NOTETAKER).    MEETINGS WITH GIUSEPPE BALDOCCI, </p><p>SECRETARY GENERAL, MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS, ROCCO </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>CANGELOSI, DIRECTOR GENERAL FOR EUROPEAN INTEGRATION, MFA, </p><p>AND OTHER MINISTRY OFFICIALS REPORTED SEPTEL. </p><p> </p><p>A SOMBER MACROECONOMIC PICTURE </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) THE CONTINUED RECESSION, THE RISING EURO (AND </p><p>PARTICULARLY ITS IMPACT ON EUROPEAN EXPORTERS), AND INCREASED </p><p>UNEMPLOYMENT, ALL HAVE LEFT EUROPEAN CONSUMERS AND INVESTORS </p><p>JITTERY ABOUT THE MARKETS, COMMENTED MAGLIANO AND </p><p>BINI-SMAGHI.  ONE OF ITALY\'S KEY TASKS AS THE EU PRESIDENT </p><p>AND A G7 COUNTRY WILL BE TO MAKE A CREDIBLE STATEMENT AND </p><p>TAKE REAL STEPS THAT WILL HELP RESTORE CONFIDENCE, ARGUED </p><p>MAGLIANO. NOTING THAT ATMOSPHERICS AT THE G7 FINANCE </p><p>MINISTERS MEETING WERE POSITIVE, WITH NO VISIBLE LINGERING </p><p>EFFECTS OF IRAQ, BINI-SMAGHI ASSERTED THAT WE SHOULD TAKE </p><p>THIS AS A MESSAGE AND FOCUS ON ECONOMIC ISSUES DURING OUR </p><p>PRESIDENCY TO HELP RESTORE U.S./EU RELATIONS TO GOOD HEALTH. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) AT THE SAME TIME, THERE ARE NO SHORTAGES OF CONCERNS, </p><p>BINI-SMAGHI CONTINUED.  THE DOLLAR\'S FUTURE VALUE IS THE </p><p>GREAT UNKNOWN.  AT THE END OF LAST WEEK\'S MEETING, G7 FINANCE </p><p>MINISTRY OFFICIALS THOUGHT THE U.S. STILL WOULD DEFEND A </p><p>STRONG DOLLAR.  ALL WERE SURPRISED BY THE WEEKEND\'S PRESS </p><p>REPORTS THAT THE U.S. ADMINISTRATION HAD BACKTRACKED FROM </p><p>THIS POSITION AND WOULD "LET THE DOLLAR FALL."  THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  02294  01 OF 03  230857Z </p><p>"AMBIGUITY" OF THE U.S. POSITION, AND THE FLUCTUATIONS OF THE </p><p>DOLLAR\'S VALUE VIS-A-VIS THE EURO, WORRY EUROPEAN CONSUMERS </p><p>AND EXPORTERS, BINI-SMAGHI CONTENDED.    EUROPEAN EXPORTERS </p><p>AND JOBS THAT DEPEND ON EXPORTS STAND TO LOSE THE MOST.  HE </p><p>ALSO OBSERVED THAT WIDESPREAD FLUCTUATIONS HAVE ONLY OCCURRED </p><p>IN THE DOLLAR/EURO VALUES.  ASIAN CURRENCIES ON THE WHOLE </p><p>HAVE MAINTAINED MORE EQUILIBRIUM WITH THE DOLLAR.  TO </p><p>COMPOUND MATTERS, MANY ASIAN INVESTORS ARE DIVERSIFYING THEIR </p><p>FINANCIAL ASSETS TO INCLUDE EURO-DENOMINATED ASSETS, WHICH </p><p>PUTS EVEN MORE UPWARD PRESSURE ON THE EURO. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) MAGLIANO AND BINI-SMAGHI AGREED THAT ITALY, A G7 </p><p>COUNTRY HOLDING THE EU PRESIDENCY, HAS A PARTICULAR </p><p>OBLIGATION TO REASSURE CONSUMERS AND INVESTORS.  (COMMENT: </p><p>THE LAST G7 COUNTRY THAT HELD THE EU PRESIDENCY WAS FRANCE </p><p>THREE YEARS AGO, WHICH WAS AT THE TAIL END OF ECONOMIC BOOM </p><p>YEARS.  END COMMENT.) WHEN QUERIED ABOUT SPECIFIC PROPOSALS </p><p>UNDER THE PRESIDENCY, BINI-SMAGHI, KEEPING THE GOI\'S CARDS </p><p>FAIRLY CLOSE TO THE CHEST, MENTIONED VAGUE PLANS ABOUT </p><p>INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT AND A WRY AND WEARY ACKNOWLEDGMENT </p><p>OF THE NEED FOR PENSION REFORM.   HE CONCEDED THAT A STRONGER </p><p>EURO MIGHT FORCE THE HAND OF GOVERNMENTS TO ADOPT SOME MAJOR </p><p>STRUCTURAL REFORMS. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) ON A DARK NOTE,  BINI-SMAGHI ACKNOWLEDGED THAT SOME </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ5090 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  02294  02 OF 03  230857Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00  CTME-00  INL-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  ANHR-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EXIM-01  E-00 </p><p>      VC-00    FRB-00   H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    ITC-01 </p><p>      LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OES-00 </p><p>      OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00 </p><p>      SCT-00   SP-00    IRM-00   SSO-00   STR-00   USIE-00  PMB-00 </p><p>      DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-01   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /009W </p><p>                  ------------------69EE73  230858Z /38 </p><p>P 230850Z MAY 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 0065 </p><p>INFO EU MEMBER STATES COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p>AMCONSUL FLORENCE PRIORITY </p><p>AMCONSUL FRANKFURT PRIORITY </p><p>AMCONSUL MILAN PRIORITY </p><p>AMCONSUL NAPLES PRIORITY </p><p>DEPT OF COMMERCE WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>DEPT OF LABOR WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>DEPT OF TREASURY WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>USEU BRUSSELS PRIORITY 3241 </p><p>USMISSION USNATO PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 ROME 002294 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>PASS PASS USOECD; STATE PASS USTR; GENEVA FOR USTR; USDOC </p><p>4212/ITA/OEURA/CPD/DDEFALCO </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  02294  02 OF 03  230857Z </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/22/2008 </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, PGOV, ETRD, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: PDAS RIES VISIT: ECONOMIC PRIORITIES FOR ITALY\'S </p><p>EU PRESIDENCY </p><p> </p><p>GOI OFFICIALS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE "WORST-CASE" ECONOMIC </p><p>SCENARIO UNDER THE ITALIAN PRESIDENCY: A BREAKDOWN IN THE </p><p>DOHA TRADE ROUND, AN UNCONTROLLED FREE-FALL OF THE U.S. </p><p>DOLLAR WITH A DOLLAR/EURO EXCHANGE RATE OF LEVELS UP TO </p><p>$1.40/E1, AND UNEMPLOYMENT IN EUROPE EXACERBATED BY A STRONG </p><p>EURO.   ALTHOUGH NONE OF THESE IS SPECIFICALLY UNDER ITALY\'S </p><p>CONTROL, THE GOI DOES NOT WANT TO BE IN THE CHAIR IF EUROPE\'S </p><p>ECONOMY TRULY STALLS. </p><p> </p><p>DEFENSE SPENDING AND STABILITY PACT </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) ASKED ABOUT NEWS REPORTS EARLIER THAT DAY THAT GERMAN, </p><p>ITALIAN AND FRENCH DEFENSE MINISTERS ARE ADVOCATING THAT </p><p>DEFENSE EXPENDITURES BE EXCLUDED FROM STABILITY PACT </p><p>REQUIREMENTS, ALLOWING THE BIG THREE TO INCREASE DEFENSE </p><p>EXPENDITURES,  BINI-SMAGHI POLITELY SCOFFED AS THIS PURPORTED </p><p>AGREEMENT, CALLING IT A "PRIVATE INITIATIVE."  "THEY CAN SAY </p><p>WHAT THEY LIKE," HE SHRUGGED, BUT STRESSED THAT FINANCE </p><p>MINISTERS, NOT DEFENSE MINISTERS, ARE THE ONES OBLIGED TO </p><p>FULFILL STABILITY PACT REQUIREMENTS.  COMMENT: THE COMMISSION </p><p>HAS RULED OUT EASING THE MAASTRICHT CRITERIA BY EXCLUDING </p><p>DEFENSE FROM OVERALL EXPENDITURES. EARLIER THIS MONTH, </p><p>DIRECTOR GENERAL ARRIGO SADUN OF THE FINANCE MINISTRY TOLD US </p><p>THAT FINANCE MINISTER TREMONTI IS LOOKING AT CREATIVE WAYS TO </p><p>FINANCE INCREASED DEFENSE EXPENDITURES, WITHOUT VIOLATING </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  02294  02 OF 03  230857Z </p><p>STABILITY PACT COMMITMENTS.  DURING THE 2002 BUDGET DEBATE IN </p><p>ITALY, TREMONTI PROPOSED SIGNIFICANT CUTS IN DEFENSE SPENDING </p><p>TO MEET STABILITY PACT REQUIREMENTS.  HE BACKTRACKED, </p><p>HOWEVER, AFTER INTENSE PRESSURE FROM DEFENSE MINISTER MARTINO </p><p>AND LATER, FROM PRIME MINISTER BERLUSCONI, WHO HAD PROMISED </p><p>NATO SYG ROBERTSON THAT ITALY WOULD IMPROVE ITS MILITARY </p><p>CAPABILITIES. END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) IN RESPONSE TO PDAS RIES\' SUGGESTION THAT THE US AND </p><p>EU SHOULD DO MORE TO JOIN EFFORTS ON ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE TO </p><p>THIRD COUNTRIES, MAGLIANO CONCURRED, NOTING THAT JOINT </p><p>PROJECTS COULD HELP BRIDGE THE CURRENT GAP BETWEEN THE U.S. </p><p>AND THE EU.  HE SPECIFICALLY POINTED TO THE CASE OF IRAQI </p><p>RECONSTRUCTION PROJECTS. </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) STEFANO GATTI, DIPLOMATIC ADVISOR TO THE MINISTER OF </p><p>TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION, NOTED THAT ITALY SEES E-GOVERNMENT </p><p>AS A TOOL FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT FOR LESS-DEVELOPED </p><p>COUNTRIES.  ONE OF THE FIRST EVENTS OF ITALY\'S EU PRESIDENCY </p><p>WILL BE AN E-GOVERNMENT CONFERENCE, BRINGING TOGETHER THE EU </p><p>MEMBER STATES, MULTILATERAL DEVELOPMENT BANKS, THE UNITED </p><p>NATIONS, AND SELECTED INVITED GOVERNMENTS.   THE GOI RECENTLY </p><p>LAUNCHED TWO PROJECTS IN JORDAN ON E-PROCUREMENT AND </p><p>E-ACCOUNTING AND WILL SOON HAVE ON-LINE PROJECTS IN NIGERIA, </p><p>MOROCCO AND ALBANIA.   REGARDING THE LATTER, PDAS REMARKED </p><p>THAT ANTI-CORRUPTION EFFORTS IN THE BALKANS ARE ONE OF THE </p><p>USG\'S TOP PRIORITIES AND THAT PERHAPS, THE U.S. AND ITALY, AS </p><p>EU PRESIDENT, COULD WORK TOGETHER. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  02294  02 OF 03  230857Z </p><p> </p><p>TRADE, CAP REFORM, AND THE TABD </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) THE GOI SUPPORTS A STRONG STATEMENT BY G7 COUNTRIES, </p><p>AT THE JUNE 1-2 SUMMIT IN EVIAN, IN SUPPORT OF THE PRINCIPLES </p><p>OF THE DOHA TRADE ROUND.  THIS WILL HELP CLEAR THE WAY FOR A </p><p>SIMILAR U.S./EU STATEMENT, WHICH ITALY WILL PRESS FOR UNDER </p><p>ITS PRESIDENCY.   SUCH A STATEMENT IS A WIN-WIN FOR ALL </p><p>PARTIES, MAGLIANO ARGUED.  TRADE DG TETI STRESSED THAT THE </p><p>GOI HOPED THE ITALIAN EU PRESIDENCY WOULD BE A TIME OF </p><p>COOLING OFF, NON-CONFRONTATION, AND A WILLINGNESS TO SEARCH </p><p>FOR COMMON GROUND BY BOTH SIDES OF THE ATLANTIC.  IN THIS </p><p>CONTEXT, HE SAID THE GOI WOULD BE PREPARED TO TAKE A MORE </p><p>LIMITED AND "PRAGMATIC APPROACH" TO GEOGRAPHIC INDICATIONS </p><p>(ITS TOP DOHA PRIORITY).  HE PREDICTED THAT PROGRESS ON CAP </p><p>REFORM IN THE NEAR FUTURE WOULD HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE </p><p>EU\'S POSITION ON AGRICULTURE WITHIN THE WTO NEGOTIATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU) ON THE ISSUE OF THE MID-TERM REVIEW OF THE COMMON </p><p>AGRICULTURAL POLICY (CAP), BOTH DE LUTIO AND TETI WERE </p><p>HOPEFUL THAT THE AGRICULTURAL COUNCIL COULD REACH AGREEMENT </p><p>UNDER THE GREK PRESIDENCY.  TETI IN PARTICULAR WAS SENSITIVE </p><p>TO THE IMPORTANCE OF REACHING AGREEMENT BY THE ENDOF JUNE IF </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ5088 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  02294  03 OF 03  230857Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00  CTME-00  INL-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  ANHR-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EXIM-01  E-00 </p><p>      VC-00    FRB-00   H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    ITC-01 </p><p>      LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OES-00 </p><p>      OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00 </p><p>      SCT-00   SP-00    IRM-00   SSO-00   STR-00   USIE-00  EPAE-00 </p><p>      PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-01   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00 </p><p>        /009W </p><p>                  ------------------69EE7E  230857Z /38 </p><p>P 230850Z MAY 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 0066 </p><p>INFO EU MEMBER STATES COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p>AMCONSUL FLORENCE PRIORITY </p><p>AMCONSUL FRANKFURT PRIORITY </p><p>AMCONSUL MILAN PRIORITY </p><p>AMCONSUL NAPLES PRIORITY </p><p>DEPT OF COMMERCE WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>DEPT OF LABOR WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>DEPT OF TREASURY WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>USEU BRUSSELS PRIORITY 3242 </p><p>USMISSION USNATO PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 ROME 002294 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>PASS PASS USOECD; STATE PASS USTR; GENEVA FOR USTR; USDOC </p><p>4212/ITA/OEURA/CPD/DDEFALCO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  02294  03 OF 03  230857Z </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/22/2008 </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, PGOV, ETRD, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: PDAS RIES VISIT: ECONOMIC PRIORITIES FOR ITALY\'S </p><p>EU PRESIDENCY </p><p> </p><p>THERE IS TO BE ANY CHANCE OF A SUCCESSFUL AGRICULTURAL </p><p>AGREEMENT AT THE SEPTEMBER WTO MINISTERIAL IN CANCUN.
