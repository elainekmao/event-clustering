THE U.S. HAD MADE </p><p>REPEATED ATTEMPTS TO SOLVE THE CRISIS BY DIPLOMATIC </p><p>MEANS BUT NORIEGA HAD REJECTED ALL SUCH ATTEMPTS.  THE </p><p>USG CONSULTED WITH THE DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED </p><p>LEADERSHIP, WHO APPROVED OF OUR ACTIONS.  TEXT OF U.S. </p><p>STATEMENT IN PARA 6. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  TEXT OF U.S. STATEMENT: </p><p> </p><p>BEGIN TEXT:  MR. PRESIDENT, IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLE </p><p>51 OF THE UNITED NATIONS CHARTER UNITED STATES FORCES </p><p>HAVE EXERCISED THEIR INHERENT RIGHT OF SELF-DEFENSE </p><p>UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW BY TAKING ACTION IN PANAMA IN </p><p>RESPONSE TO ARMED ATTACKS BY FORCES UNDER THE DIRECTION </p><p>OF MANUEL NORIEGA.  THE ACTION IS DESIGNED TO PROTECT </p><p>AMERICAN LIVES AS WELL AS TO FULFILL THE OBLIGATIONS OF </p><p>THE UNTIED STATES TO DEFEND THE INTEGRITY OF THE PANAMA </p><p>CANAL TREATIES.  WE SHARE THE SORROW OF ALL THAT THESE </p><p>NECESSARY ACTIONS HAVE CAUSED A LOSS OF LIFE AND DAMAGE. </p><p> </p><p>THE SITUATION IN PANAMA HAS BEEN INTOLERABLE.  FOR </p><p>NEARLY TWO YEARS, THE UNITED STATES, THE NATIONS OF </p><p>LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN WORKED TOGETHER TO TRY </p><p>TO RESOLVE THE CRISIS IN PANAMA.  THE GOALS OF THE </p><p>UNITED STATES REMAINED UNCHANGED THROUGHOUT THIS PERIOD </p><p>- TO SAFEGUARD THE LIVES OF AMERICANS, TO DEFEND </p><p>DEMOCRACY IN PANAMA, TO COMBAT DRUG TRAFFICKING AND TO </p><p>PROTECT THE INTEGRITY OF THE PANAMA CANAL TREATY. </p><p>REPEATED ATTEMPTS WERE MADE TO SOLVE THE CRISIS THROUGH </p><p>DIPLOMATIC MEANS AND NEGOTIATIONS.  NORIEGA TURNED THEM </p><p>ALL DOWN. </p><p> </p><p>THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE CRISIS IN PANAMA HAS BEEN THE </p><p>STRUGGLE BETWEEN NORIEGA AND HIS THUGS AND THE PEOPLE OF </p><p>PANAMA.  HIS RUTHLESS CABAL REPEATEDLY OBSTRUCTED THE </p><p>WILL OF THE PANAMANIAN PEOPLE WHICH HAD BEEN EXPRESSED </p><p>IN FREE ELECTIONS.  AS A RESULT OF LAST NIGHT\'S ACTIONS </p><p>THIS SITUATION HAS BEEN REVERSED.  THE FREELY ELECTED </p><p>LEADERS OF PANAMA PRESIDENT GUILLERMO ENDARA AND VICE </p><p>PRESIDENTS ARIAS CALDERON AND FORD HAVE ASSUMED THE </p><p>RIGHTFUL LEADERSHIP OF THEIR COUNTRY. </p><p> </p><p>IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT THE UNTIED STATES GOVERNMENT </p><p>CONSULTED WITH THE DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED LEADERSHIP </p><p>PRIOR TO LAST EVENING\'S ACTIONS AND THAT THEY APPROVED </p><p>OF OUR STEPS. </p><p> </p><p>SOME MAY ASK WHY MY GOVERNMENT HAD TO TAKE MILITARY </p><p>ACTION NOW.  PRESIDENT BUSH PROVIDED THE ANSWER THIS </p><p>MORNING:  "LAST FRIDAY, NORIEGA DECLARED HIS MILITARY </p><p>DICTATORSHIP TO BE IN A STATE OF WAR WITH THE UNITED </p><p>STATES AND PUBLICLY THREATENED THE LIVES OF AMERICANS </p><p>LIVING IN PANAMA.  THE VERY NEXT DAY, FORCES UNDER HIS </p><p>COMMAND SHOT AND KILLED AN UNARMED AMERICAN SERVICEMAN, </p><p>WOUNDED ANOTHER, ARRESTED AND BRUTALLY BEAT A THIRD </p><p>AMERICAN SERVICEMAN, AND THEN BRUTALLY INTERROGATED HIS </p><p>WIFE, THREATENING HER WITH SEXUAL ABUSE. </p><p> </p><p>THAT WAS ENOUGH. </p><p> </p><p>GENERAL NORIEGA\'S RECKLESS THREATS AND ATTACKS UPON </p><p>AMERICANS IN PANAMA CREATED AN IMMINENT DANGER TO THE </p><p>35,000 AMERICAN CITIZENS IN PANAMA.  AS PRESIDENT, I </p><p>HAVE NO HIGHER OBLIGATION THAN TO SAFEGUARD THE LIVES OF </p><p>AMERICAN CITIZENS.  AND THAT IS WHY I DIRECTED OUR ARMED </p><p>FORCES TO PROTECT THE LIVES OF AMERICAN CITIZENS IN </p><p>PANAMA AND TO BRING GENERAL NORIEGA TO JUSTICE IN THE </p><p>UNITED STATES." </p><p> </p><p>I WANT FOR A FEW MINUTES TO NOTE THAT THE TURN TOWARD </p><p>DEMOCRACY THAT CHARACTERIZES OUR ERA BEGAN IN THIS </p><p>HEMISPHERE.  IN RECENT YEARS, NATION AFTER NATION HAS </p><p>DECIDE TO FOLLOW THE DEMOCRATIC PATH.  TOGETHER, HERE IN </p><p>THE AMERICAS, WE ARE BUILDING THE WORLD\'S FIRST </p><p>DEMOCRATIC HEMISPHERE. </p><p> </p><p>THE PEOPLE OF PANAMA BEGAN THEIR HISTORIC JOURNEY TOWARD </p><p>DEMOCRACY WHEN THEY SPOKE CLEARLY ON MAY 7 OF THIS </p><p>YEAR.  THEY VOTED FOR NATIONAL DIGNITY.  THEY VOTED TO </p><p>END A BRUTAL DICTATORSHIP.  THEY VOTED TO BE FREE.  THEY </p><p>HAVE A RIGHT TO BE FREE. NO ONE HAS A RIGHT TO DENY THAT </p><p>FREEDOM. </p><p> </p><p>NEVERTHELESS, THAT VOTE FOR DEMOCRACY WAS MET WITH </p><p>NORIEGA\'S IRON PIPES AND RIFLE BUTTS, HIRED MOBS AND </p><p>PRISON CELLS.  THE WHOLE WORLD DENOUNCED THE VIOLATION </p><p>OF HUMAN RIGHTS WHICH WE WITNESSED IN PANAMA AS DID THE </p><p>ORGANIZATION OF AMERICAN STATES.  INDEED THE IMAGES OF </p><p>COURAGE AND THE IMAGES OF BLOOD FROM THAT HISTORIC WEEK </p><p>IN PANAMA WILL ALWAYS BE ETCHED IN OUR MEMORY. </p><p> </p><p>THE QUESTION BEFORE US HAS NEVER BEEN OUR COMMITMENT TO </p><p>PANAMANIAN SOVEREIGNTY NOT IS IT TODAY.  FOR THE </p><p>SOVEREIGN WILL OF THE PANAMANIAN PEOPLE IS WHAT WE ARE </p><p>HERE DEFENDING.  THE QUESTION BEFORE US WAS OUR </p><p>COMMITMENT TO UPHOLD THOSE HISTORIC TREATIES FROM THE </p><p>DAY THEY WERE SIGNED. </p><p> </p><p>AND LET US BE CLEAR ABOUT ONE THING, IF NOTHING ELSE. </p><p>NORIEGA DID NOT STEAL THE MAY 7 ELECTION BECAUSE OF </p><p>"SANCTIONS" OR THE LEGITIMATE EXERCISE OF TREATY </p><p>RIGHTS.  HE STOLE THE ELECTION BECAUSE HE LOST IT, AND </p><p>ATTEMPTS TO SHIFT THE FOCUS FROM THAT OVERWHELMING FACT </p><p>ARE NOTHING MORE OR LESS THAN DELIBERATE OBFUSCATION. </p><p>THERE IS ANOTHER ISSUE AT STAKE IN THIS DEBATE OVER </p><p>PANAMA -- THE DISGRACE, THE TERRIBLE EVIL OF DRUG </p><p>TRAFFICKING.  WE HAVE BEEN REMINDED AGAIN OF THE </p><p>TERRIBLE PRICE BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN -- AND WHOLE </p><p>SOCIETIES -- PAY BECAUSE THESE MONSTERS -- THESE DRUG </p><p>TRAFFICKERS -- CONTINUE IN OUR MIDST. </p><p> </p><p>THIS IS A WAR AS DEADLY AND AS DANGEROUS AS ANY FOUGHT </p><p>WITH ARMIES MASSED ACROSS BORDERS; THE SURVIVAL OF </p><p>DEMOCRATIC NATIONS IS AT STAKE. </p><p> </p><p>COUNTRIES THAT PROVIDE SAFE HAVEN AND SUPPORT FOR THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL DRUG TRAFFICKING CARTELS MENACE THE PEACE </p><p>AND SECURITY JUST AS SURELY AS IF THEY WERE USING THEIR </p><p>OWN CONVENTIONAL MILITARY FORCES TO ATTACK OUR </p><p>SOCIETIES.  THE TRUTH IS, AND EVERY ONE OF US KNOWS IT, </p><p>GENERAL NORIEGA TURNED PANAMA INTO A HAVEN FOR DRUG </p><p>TRAFFICKERS AND A CENTER FOR MONEY LAUNDERING AND </p><p> </p><p>TRANS-SHIPMENT OF COCAINE.  GENERAL NORIEGA COULD NOT BE </p><p>PERMITTED FALSELY TO WRAP HIMSELF IN THE FLAG OF </p><p>PANAMANIAN SOVEREIGNTY WHILE THE DRUG CARTELS WITH WHICH </p><p>HE IS ALLIED INTERVENE THROUGHOUT THIS HEMISPHERE. </p><p>THAT, MR. PRESIDENT, IS AGGRESSION.  IT IS AGGRESSION </p><p>AGAINST US ALL, AND NOW IT IS BEING BROUGHT TO AN END. </p><p> </p><p>MR. PRESIDENT I ALSO WISH TO POINT OUT THAT THE UNITED </p><p>STATES HAS BOTH THE RIGHT, AND FOR THAT MATTER, THE DUTY </p><p>TO PROTECT AND DEFEND THE PANAMA CANAL UNDER ARTICLE 4 </p><p>OF THE PANAMA CANAL TREATY.  THE BASIC UNITED STATES\' </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY IS TO OPERATED AND DEFEND THE PANAMA </p><p>CANAL UNTIL ITS TRANSFER TO PANAMA AT THE END OF THIS </p><p>CENTURY.  EVEN DURING THE NORIEGA REGIME\'S ILLEGAL </p><p>SEIZURE OF POWER THE UNITED STATES HAS CONTINUED TO DO </p><p>WHAT IT HAS DONE SINCE THE ENTRY INTO FORCE OF THE </p><p>TREATY A DECADE AGO - PROVIDING FOR THE SAFE AND ORDERLY </p><p>TRANSIT OF VESSELS THROUGH THE CANAL WHILE ASSURING </p><p>INCREASING PANAMANIAN PARTICIPATION IN ITS MANAGEMENT </p><p>AND OPERATION. </p><p> </p><p>FOR THE PAST TWO YEARS THE NORIEGA REGIME ENGAGED IN A </p><p>SYSTEMATIC CAMPAIGN TO HARASS AND INTIMIDATE UNITED </p><p>STATES AND PANAMANIAN EMPLOYEES OF THE PANAMA CANAL </p><p>COMMISSION AND THE UNITED STATES FORCES.  IN THE LAST </p><p>YEAR ALONE, THERE HAVE BEEN OVER 300 VIOLATIONS OF U.S. </p><p>MILITARY BASES BY ARMED PANAMANIAN DEFENSE FORCES </p><p>PERSONNEL; OVER 400 U.S. PERSONNEL HAVE BEEN DETAINED </p><p>AND 140 U.S. PERSONNEL HAVE BEEN ENDANGERED.  THIS </p><p>PROVOCATIVE AND INTOLERABLE BEHAVIOR REACHED A PEAK LAST </p><p>FRIDAY.  IT THREATENED AMERICAN AND PANAMANIAN LIVES AS </p><p>WELL AS CANAL OPERATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>AS THE COUNCIL DEBATES THIS ISSUE IT IS WORTH NOTING </p><p>THAT CHAPTER VIII OF THE CHARTER CALLS UPON MEMBER </p><p>STATES TO MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO USE REGIONAL AGENCIES TO </p><p>SOLVE REGIONAL PROBLEMS.  THE LANGUAGE OF ARTICLE 52 IS </p><p>STRIKING IN ITS USE OF THE WORD "SHALL" IN THIS </p><p>CONTEXT.  THE USE OF "SHALL" LEAVES LITTLE ROOM FOR </p><p>DOUBT THAT MEMBERS OF A REGIONAL ARRANGEMENT ARE OBLIGED </p><p>TO REFER REGIONAL DISPUTES TO REGIONAL ORGANIZATIONS AND </p><p>THAT THE SECURITY COUNCIL IS OBLIGATED TO ENCOURAGE THIS </p><p>RECOURSE TO REGIONAL AGENCIES.  CURRENTLY THE </p><p>ORGANIZATION OF AMERICAN STATES IS ENGAGED IN THAT </p><p>EFFORT. </p><p> </p><p>ASIDE FROM THE LEGAL CONSEQUENCES THAT FLOW FROM THE USE </p><p>OF "SHALL" IN CHAPTER VIII, COMMON SENSE DICTATES THAT </p><p>WHERE THERE IS A REGIONAL ORGANIZATION AND A REGIONAL </p><p>PROBLEM, RECOURSE SHOULD BE TO THE REGIONAL ORGANIZATION. </p><p>THIS NEED NOT AND DOES NOT PRECLUDE UN INVOLVEMENT. </p><p>HOWEVER, THE RISK OF WASTEFUL DUPLICATION IS OBVIOUS. </p><p>FAR MORE SERIOUS IS THE POSSIBILITY FOR REACHING </p><p>INCONSISTENT CONCLUSIONS.  IT IS IMPORTANT THAT </p><p>INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS CONTRIBUTE TO RESOLVING </p><p>PROBLEMS NOT FURTHER COMPLICATE THEM. </p><p> </p><p>THE PURPOSE OF THE UNITED STATES IN THIS CRISIS IS CLEAR </p><p>AND CONSISTENT.  WE RESORTED TO MILITARY ACTION UNDER </p><p>ARTICLE 51 IN A SITUATION WHERE AMERICAN LIVES WERE </p><p>CLEARLY IN DANGER AND WHERE OUR ABILITY TO HONOR </p><p>OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE PANAMA CANAL TREATY WAS THREATENED </p><p>BY VIOLENT ACTIONS.  WE DID SO IN A MANNER DESIGNED TO </p><p>MINIMIZE CASUALTIES AND DAMAGE.  WE CONSULTED IN ADVANCE </p><p>WITH THE DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED LEADERS OF PANAMA AND </p><p>THEY APPROVED OF OUR ACTIONS. WE INTEND TO WITHDRAW OUR </p><p>FORCES FROM PANAMA AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND AS </p><p>PRESIDENT BUSH SAID: </p><p> </p><p>"THE UNITED STATES IS EAGER TO WORK WITH THE PANAMANIAN </p><p>PEOPLE IN PARTNERSHIP AND FRIENDSHIP TO REBUILD THEIR </p><p>ECONOMY.  THE PANAMANIAN PEOPLE WANT DEMOCRACY, PEACE, </p><p>AND THE CHANCE FOR A BETTER LIFE IN DIGNITY AND </p><p>FREEDOM.  THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES SEEK ONLY TO </p><p>SUPPORT THEM IN PURSUIT OF THESE NOBLE GOALS." </p><p> </p><p>IN SUM, MR PRESIDENT, I WOULD LIKE TO QUOTE FROM A </p><p>STATEMENT MADE THIS AFTERNOON BY SECRETARY BAKER.  OUR </p><p>FOREIGN-POLICY GOALS IN PANAMA HAVE BEEN CLEAR, AND </p><p>THEY\'VE BEEN CONSISTENT.  WE HAVE SOUGHT TO HELP THE </p><p>PANAMANIAN PEOPLE BUILD AN AUTHENTIC DEMOCRACY.  WE HAVE </p><p>BEEN COMMITTED TO FULL IMPLEMENTATION AND REMAIN </p><p>COMMITTED TO FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PANAMA CANAL </p><p>TREATIES. </p><p> </p><p>WE HAVE MADE UNPRECEDENTED EFFORTS THROUGH THE OAS AND </p><p>IN CONSULTATIONS WITH LATIN AND CARIBBEAN LEADERS, AS </p><p>WELL AS OTHERS, TO RESOLVE THE CRISIS IN PANAMA. </p><p> </p><p>WE HOPED AND BELIEVE THAT THE ELECTIONS HELD LAST MAY </p><p>COULD BE A MEANS TO RESOLVE THE CRISIS, BUT WHEN NORIEGA </p><p>STOLE THAT ELECTION AND VIOLENTLY SUPPRESSED THE </p><p>OPPOSITION THE CRISIS ONLY GREW WORSE. </p><p> </p><p>PRESIDENT BUSH HAS CONTINUALLY SAID THAT HE WOULD NOT </p><p>RULE OUT THE USE OF FORCE BUT HE ALSO SAID, REPEATEDLY, </p><p>THAT FORCE WAS CLEARLY THE LAST OPTION TO BE </p><p>CONSIDERED.  THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT.  END TEXT. </p><p>PICKERING </p><p>UNQUOTE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BAKER </p><p></p></div>
