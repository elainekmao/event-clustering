<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 LAGOS 000499 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR OECD/IEA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EPET, ENRG, EFIN, ECON, EINV, PINS, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: ENERGY UPDATE, FEB 28 </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA 00048 </p><p> </p><p>1. This periodic update covering energy issues </p><p>includes: </p><p>--Long Lines - Short on Answers; Fuel Crisis Continues </p><p>--Obasanjo Offers Onshore/Offshore Compromise </p><p>--Exxon-Mobil Produces Early from Yoho Fields, and </p><p>--Marginal Oil Fields Awarded </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>LONG LINES - SHORT ON ANSWERS; FUEL CRISIS CONTINUES </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>2. Just as the strike by workers of the Department of </p><p>Petroleum Resources (DPR) was drawing to a close, </p><p>Nigeria faced a new challenge in its energy sector; </p><p>failed deliveries of finished petroleum caused serious </p><p>fuel shortages throughout Nigeria last week, closing </p><p>gas stations and forcing consumers to queue in lines </p><p>not seen in years.  In cities across Nigeria, lines </p><p>snaked up to two miles from filling stations open only </p><p>a few hours a day, and in some instances cars were </p><p>simply left idle in place, adding to already chaotic </p><p>traffic situations.  Those consumers who were able to </p><p>top off their tanks faced hiked prices by pump </p><p>attendants or roadside black marketers, and those who </p><p>used public transport paid higher fares when they </p><p>managed to find their way onto a running vehicle.  Area </p><p>boys took advantage of the captive audiences, extorting </p><p>money from motorists and passersby by intimidation and </p><p>force. </p><p> </p><p>3. Original theories that the DPR strike was the root </p><p>of the gas lines gave way to the reality that Nigeria </p><p>was simply running out of fuel.  Nigeria imports nearly </p><p>half of the refined petroleum products it consumes, and </p><p>the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) </p><p>revealed that, in the wake of rising world petroleum </p><p>prices caused by the growing tension over Iraq and the </p><p>ongoing troubles in Venezuela, its suppliers redirected </p><p>January and February shipments to more lucrative sales </p><p>to the US and Venezuela.  NNPC received just 30 percent </p><p>of its contracted cargo in January, driving its fuel </p><p>stock down from a 20-day reserve to an 11-day reserve </p><p>by February 24.  It is reported that NNPC has changed </p><p>its import pricing formula to better reflect market </p><p>trends, which will add a 10 to 20 percent premium to </p><p>Nigeria\'s import costs. </p><p> </p><p>4. To combat the shortages, NNPC ordered its second and </p><p>third quarter shipments for delivery at the same time. </p><p>The government also hopes to have its two refineries at </p><p>Port Harcourt, which have been offline due to power </p><p>problems and maintenance, running again soon. In the </p><p>short term, two ships recently off-loaded 56 million </p><p>liters of gasoline, but this may offer only a very </p><p>brief reprieve as the daily national demand runs from </p><p>18 to 25 million liters.  Further, an Exxon-Mobil </p><p>official told Econoff that the sorry state of tanker </p><p>facilities in Lagos will slow all off-loading, so that </p><p>even when ships come in, fuel will not flow quickly to </p><p>consumers.  The situation did improve over the weekend, </p><p>as gas lines receded and filling stations were </p><p>returning to normal business hours this week.  However, </p><p>spot reports of new queues are coming in again as the </p><p>week goes on. </p><p> </p><p>5. Comment: The irony that the world\'s seventh largest </p><p>crude oil exporter must import half of its refined </p><p>petroleum products has not been lost on commentators </p><p>and consumers alike. A fuel crisis reminding Nigerians </p><p>of bygone days of military rule and of the fragile </p><p>state of their economy comes at a terrible time for </p><p>President Obasanjo, less than two months before the </p><p>national election.  With each new incident of ethnic </p><p>violence, tensions are certain to rise if an ongoing </p><p>fuel shortages continue to hamper the daily routine of </p><p>business and personal lives.  Suggesting the gravity of </p><p>the government\'s concern over the situation, </p><p>Information Minister Jerry Gana publicly blamed the gas </p><p>lines on a smear campaign by Obasanjo opponents, and </p><p>radio news reports quoted Obasanjo as saying there is </p><p>no fuel shortage, but rather, people are simply </p><p>hoarding gasoline. Fuel shortages will continue should </p><p>Nigeria fail to make market-competitive purchase offers </p><p>for gasoline as US demand for it rises on the eve of </p><p>possible conflict in Iraq and the upcoming summer </p><p>driving season. </p><p> </p><p>6. Comment continued: One positive outcome of this fuel </p><p>shortage may be renewed interest in deregulating and </p><p>commercializing Nigeria\'s downstream petroleum sector. </p><p>John Pototsky, Managing Director of Mobil Oil Nigeria </p><p>(MON), was recently quoted as saying that while MON </p><p>enjoyed higher sales volume in 2002, its profits were </p><p>very low due to the GON\'s pricing scheme.  As recently </p><p>as 2000 and 2001, downstream marketers imported </p><p>gasoline since the world market price and the domestic </p><p>retail pump price were aligned closely enough for the </p><p>companies to manage small but notable profits.  More </p><p>recently, world market prices have far exceeded those </p><p>that the retailers are allowed to charge at the pump, </p><p>so the NNPC has essentially become the sole importer of </p><p>gasoline. The downstream international operators import </p><p>gasoline for the NNPC at world market prices, fuel that </p><p>the NNPC sells at artificially low prices. Obasanjo\'s </p><p>energy adviser, Rilwanu Lukman, was quoted as saying </p><p>the system cannot be maintained at current prices owing </p><p>to the large government subsidies it entails. A </p><p>"BusinessDay" editorial called for a shift to free </p><p>market mechanisms, including invitations to foreign </p><p>companies to purchase and maintain existing refineries, </p><p>pipelines and depots. End comment. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>OBASANJO OFFERS ONSHORE/OFFSHORE COMPROMISE </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. President Obasanjo offered a compromise in the </p><p>ongoing legislative battle over the allocation of oil </p><p>revenue between the federal government and those states </p><p>from which oil is extracted (reftel).  In a letter read </p><p>to the Senate this week, Obasanjo calls for abandoning </p><p>the earlier proposals by him and the National Assembly </p><p>for demarcating what production is onshore versus </p><p>offshore for revenue sharing purposes.  Obasanjo had </p><p>previously proposed that a 24-mile contiguous zone off </p><p>the coastline should be used to determine which </p><p>production sites are subject to the special derivation </p><p>fund, from which oil producing states are entitled to a </p><p>13 percent share of oil tax and royalties.  The </p><p>National Assembly\'s formula would have extended the </p><p>reach of the derivation fund to the Continental shelf </p><p>and the Economic Zone.  Obasanjo now argues both plans </p><p>have technical and political drawbacks, and instead, </p><p>proposes that all production lying within 200 meters of </p><p>water should be subject to the derivation fund. </p><p> </p><p>8. An Exxon-Mobil representative confirmed that all </p><p>existing producing oil fields lie within a 200-meter </p><p>depth zone, which is roughly equivalent to the edge of </p><p>the Continental Shelf.  This proposal would then place </p><p>all deepwater oil discoveries not yet producing outside </p><p>the scope of the derivation fund and within the sole </p><p>purview of the federated account, the funds of which </p><p>are distributed on the basis of a complicated formula </p><p>amongst the federal government and all states and local </p><p>governments. </p><p> </p><p>9. Comment: The Exxon-Mobil representative noted that </p><p>prior to last year\'s Supreme Court ruling defining </p><p>onshore and offshore to the federal government\'s </p><p>advantage, Akwa Ibom state received three billion Naira </p><p>each month from the derivation fund, but was left with </p><p>no revenue from that account as a result of the ruling. </p><p>(The federal government has been providing the state </p><p>600 million Naira per month in the intervening period, </p><p>according to our industry source.) He estimates that </p><p>Obasanjo\'s proposal will provide Akwa Ibom with the </p><p>same revenue it previously enjoyed.  Thus, he </p><p>anticipates the littoral states will support Obasanjo\'s </p><p>new proposal, as is evidenced by public support voiced </p><p>by the governor of Delta State.  If this measure is </p><p>successful in the National Assembly, it could go a long </p><p>way toward shoring up political support for Obasanjo in </p><p>the South South; the leaders from the Northern states, </p><p>however, are unlikely to easily accept any proposal </p><p>conferring benefit to the South. End comment. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>EXXON-MOBIL PRODUCES OIL EARLY FROM YOHO FIELDS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>10. Exxon-Mobil has begun production from its Yoho </p><p>development project two years ahead of schedule, by </p><p>using a temporary floating, production, storage and off- </p><p>loading (FPSO)vessel as an early production system </p><p>(ESP).  The Yoho project is a Mobil Producing Nigeria </p><p>(MPN)and NNPC joint venture (JV), located in the </p><p>relatively shallow waters of Oil Mining Lease(OML) 104. </p><p>The $1.2 billion project has estimated recoverable </p><p>resources of 0.4 billion barrels of oil, and represents </p><p>the first deployment of an ESP in West Africa.  The </p><p>Yoho JV will have a production capacity of </p><p>approximately 650,000 barrels per day I(bpd), and while </p><p>press reports indicate it is currently producing 90,000 </p><p>bpd, an Exxon-Mobil executive told Econoff it is </p><p>already reaching or exceeding 100,000 bpd. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>MARGINAL OIL FIELDS AWARDED </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11. After a sometimes contentious two-year process, the </p><p>federal government this week announced 31 companies who </p><p>have won licenses to operate 24 marginal oil fields in </p><p>the Niger Delta.  The fields may hold up to 2.3 million </p><p>barrels of crude oil, and are considered marginal </p><p>because each produces no more than approximately 5,000 </p><p>bpd, which the major oil companies consider </p><p>economically unviable for the scale of their </p><p>operations.  The GON hoped to spur development of </p><p>indigenous companies, greater domestic income and more </p><p>local jobs through the sale of these marginal fields. </p><p>It reviewed bids from 66 companies, including several </p><p>state-owned firms.  Presidential energy adviser Lukman </p><p>called on the winning firms to aggressively develop </p><p>their operations, and implored the financial industry </p><p>to assist these companies in raising capital. </p><p> </p><p>HINSON-JONES </p><p></p></div>
