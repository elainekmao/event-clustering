<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 NEW DELHI 002879 </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA/INS </p><p>LONDON FOR TUELLER </p><p>RABAT FOR USREY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/07/03 </p><p>TAGS: PARM, MARR, PGOV, PREL, IN </p><p>SUBJECT: INDIAN REACTION TO PAKISTAN\'S MISSILE TEST </p><p> </p><p>REF:  ISLAMABAD 2617 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED CONFIDENTIAL BY NEW DELHI POLITICAL </p><p>COUNSELOR ERIC TUNIS, REASON 1.5 (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  SUMMARY:  INDIAN OFFICIAL REACTION TO </p><p>PAKISTAN\'S RECENT FLIGHT TEST OF THE GHAURI BALLISTIC </p><p>MISSILE (REFTEL) HAS BEEN MEASURED THUS FAR.  THE NEWS </p><p>OF THE PAKISTANI MISSILE TEST RAN SECOND TO THE </p><p>CORONATION OF SONIA GANDHI AS THE NEW LEADER OF THE </p><p>CONGRESS PARTY IN MOST NEWSPAPERS ON APRIL 7.  DEFENSE </p><p>MINISTER GEORGE FERNANDES GAVE A COOL AND DELIBERATE </p><p>STATEMENT TO A PRESS CONFERENCE IN NEW DELHI ON THE </p><p>EVENING OF APRIL 6, NOTING THAT INDIA HAD PRIOR </p><p>INFORMATION OF THE TEST.  FERNANDES DREW A DISTINCTION </p><p>BETWEEN TEST FIRING OF THE MISSILE AND PRODUCTION, BUT </p><p>HE AVOIDED ANY COMMENT ON INDIA\'S AGNI MISSILE PROGRAM. </p><p>THE DIRECTOR FOR DISARMAMENT AND SECURITY AFFAIRS </p><p>(DISA) IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS CONFIRMED </p><p>THAT THERE HAD BEEN A RECENT SENIOR INTERAGENCY MEETING </p><p>TO DISCUSS INDIA\'S RESPONSE TO THE MISSILE TEST.  END </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>PROMINENT COVERAGE--BUT RELATIVELY MILD REACTION </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>2.  (U)  INDIAN NEWSPAPERS AND TELEVISION PROVIDED </p><p>EXTENSIVE BUT NOT INFLAMMATORY COVERAGE OF THE RECENT </p><p>TEST OF PAKISTAN\'S GHAURI BALLISTIC MISSILE.  MOST OF </p><p>THE PRESS STORIES DREW HEAVILY FROM INFORMATION </p><p>RELEASED PUBLICLY BY PAKISTAN\'S FOREIGN MINISTRY AS </p><p>WELL AS THEIR OWN DECIDEDLY INDIAN ACCOUNT OF FACTS, </p><p>SUCH AS THE TIMES OF INDIA CLAIM THAT THE TEST WAS </p><p>CARRIED OUT AT THE KAHUTA NUCLEAR RESEARCH LABORATORY. </p><p>THIS EVENT HAS PROVIDED ANOTHER FORUM FOR PROMINENT </p><p>HAWKS IN THE MEDIA--SUCH AS IDSA\'S DIRECTOR JASJIT </p><p>SINGH--TO RENEW CALLS FOR INDIA\'S DEVELOPMENT OF THE </p><p>AGNI BALLISTIC MISSILE SYSTEM.  OTHER COMMENTATORS HAVE </p><p>ALSO PORTRAYED THE GHAURI MISSILE TEST AS CONCLUSIVE </p><p>PROOF THAT THE U.S. HAS FAILED TO STOP COOPERATION </p><p>BETWEEN CHINA AND PAKISTAN IN BALLISTIC MISSILE </p><p>TECHNOLOGY.  INDEED, MUCH OF THE INDIAN PUBLIC AND </p><p>PRIVATE THINKING SEEMS TO REFLECT THE INHERENT DISDAIN </p><p>FOR PAKISTAN\'S SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY, OF WHICH BRAHMIN </p><p>HINDUS ARE CONVINCED COULD NOT PRODUCE SUCH A MISSILE </p><p>INDEPENDENTLY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  DEFENSE MINISTER GEORGE FERNANDES WAS THE </p><p>GOI\'S MAIN SPOKESMAN FOR THE INDIAN GOVERNMENT ON THIS </p><p>ISSUE.  IN A PRESS CONFERENCE APRIL 6, HE MADE THE </p><p>FOLLOWING POINTS: </p><p> </p><p>--   INDIA\'S OWN MISSILE PROGRAM IS CONTINUING. </p><p>PRITHVI MISSILES ARE CAPABLE OF REACHING ANYWHERE IN </p><p>PAKISTAN; </p><p> </p><p>--   INDIA HAD PRIOR WARNING THAT ISLAMABAD HAD BEEN </p><p>PREPARING TO TEST A MEDIUM-RANGE MISSILE; HE DESCRIBED </p><p>THE TEST AS NOT UNEXPECTED BUT OF A SERIOUS NATURE, </p><p>ALTHOUGH INDIA AND PAKISTAN ARE NOT IN A WAR-LIKE </p><p>SITUATION; </p><p> </p><p>--   THERE IS A DISTINCTION BETWEEN TESTING AND </p><p>PRODUCTION; AND </p><p> </p><p>--   IT IS UP TO THE UNITED STATES TO FIND OUT WHAT </p><p>HAPPENED IN SINO-PAKISTANI MISSILE COOPERATION DESPITE </p><p>THE EXISTENCE OF MULTILATERAL CONTROL REGIMES. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SOME INSIGHTS FROM MEA </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>4.  (C)  POLOFF MET WITH AJIT KUMAR, DIRECTOR FOR </p><p>DISARMAMENT AND INTERNATIONAL SECURITY AFFAIRS IN THE </p><p>MINISTRY FOR EXTERNAL AFFAIRS, ON APRIL 7 (SEE SEPTEL </p><p>FOR A DISCUSSION OF CWC ISSUES).  KUMAR CONFIRMED THAT </p><p>SENIOR INDIAN OFFICIALS FROM SEVERAL MINISTRIES HAD MET </p><p>SEVERAL DAYS AGO TO CONSIDER THE SITUATION REGARDING </p><p>THE GHAURI MISSILE TEST.  KUMAR OPINED THAT FERNANDES </p><p>WAS SELECTED TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THE INDIAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT BY THIS GROUP; MEA DID NOT INTEND TO MAKE </p><p>ANY STATEMENT ON THE MATTER.  NOT SURPRISINGLY, KUMAR </p><p>AGREED THAT THE MISSILE ISSUE WAS RIPE FOR DISCUSSION </p><p>IN AN INDO-PAKISTANI DIALOGUE, BUT HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT </p><p>THERE HAD BEEN NO SUBSTANTIVE DISCUSSION OF SECURITY </p><p>ISSUES AS THE TWO SIDES REMAINED DEAD-LOCKED OVER THE </p><p>PROCEDURAL LOGJAM OF ADDRESSING KASHMIR. </p><p></p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p>5. (C)  IN RESPONDING TO THE PAKISTANI MISSILE TEST, WE </p><p>SUSPECT THE INDIANS WILL ALLOW ACTIONS TO SPEAK LOUDER </p><p>THAN WORDS, WITH AN AGNI MISSILE TEST IN THE NEAR </p><p>FUTURE.  IT IS WORTH RECALLING COMMITMENTS BY PREVIOUS </p><p>INDIAN GOVERNMENTS THAT THE AGNI PROGRAM REMAINED A </p><p>HIGH PRIORITY, AND THAT THE INDIANS HAVE BEEN MULLING </p><p>OVER A DECISION TO TEST THE AGNI FOR SOME TIME NOW. </p><p>INDEED, JASJIT SINGH TOLD US THAT HE MADE ONE MORE RUN </p><p>AT PUSHING FOR AN AGNI TEST DURING GUJRAL\'S FINAL WEEKS </p><p>IN OFFICE.  THIS BJP-LED GOVERNMENT HAS MADE DEFENSE A </p><p>PROMINENT ISSUE IN ITS AGENDA AND SEVERAL OF ITS </p><p>"SECURITY EXPERTS" HAVE CALLED FOR GREATER DEVELOPMENT </p><p>OF LONGER RANGE BALLISTIC MISSILES TO ADDRESS THE </p><p>PERCEIVED CHINA THREAT.  THE DEFENSE MINISTER\'S </p><p>COMMENTS THAT INDIA CAN TARGET ALL OF PAKISTAN WITH </p><p>PRITHVI MISSILES CERTAINLY BOLSTERS ISLAMABAD\'S BELIEF </p><p>THAT IT NEEDS LONGER RANGE MISSILES TO KEEP UP WITH ITS </p><p>SOUTH ASIAN NEIGHBOR.  THE UPCOMING VISITS OF SENIOR </p><p>U.S. OFFICIALS WILL PRESENT A USEFUL OPPORTUNITY TO </p><p>URGE RESTRAINT WITH BOTH SIDES, ALTHOUGH NEW DELHI </p><p>ALMOST CERTAINLY WILL CONTINUE TO PORTRAY ITS MISSILE </p><p>PROGRAMS AS A NECESSARY RESPONSE TO THE CHINA THREAT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CELESTE </p><p></p></div>
