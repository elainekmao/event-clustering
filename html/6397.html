<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 KUWAIT 000920 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARP AND OES </p><p>STATE PASS EPA </p><p>AMMAN FOR ENVIRONMENT HUB </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: SENV, EPET, KU </p><p>SUBJECT: KUWAIT PREPARES ENVIRONMENT FOR WAR </p><p> </p><p>1. SUMMARY: As part of Kuwait\'s wide-ranging contingency </p><p>plans ahead of a potential US-led conflict in Iraq, the GOK </p><p>has established an Emergency Response Committee tasked with </p><p>protecting the country\'s environment.  Still stinging from </p><p>the devastating consequences of Saddam\'s campaign of </p><p>"environmental terrorism" waged during the Gulf War, Kuwait </p><p>has taken several steps to minimize fresh damage to its oil </p><p>industry, marine wildlife, and general well-being of its </p><p>citizenry.  While the GOK will need to rely on the US </p><p>military and others to help protect its environment in the </p><p>face of an Iraqi retaliation, especially involving missiles </p><p>and chemical or biological agents, it is encouraging to see </p><p>the effort Kuwait has made in this respect to again support </p><p>the greater US cause.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. EconOff met March 9, 2003, with key members of Kuwait\'s </p><p>newly-formed Emergency Response Committee: Dr. Mohammed </p><p>Al-Sarawi, Chairman of Kuwait\'s Environment Public Authority </p><p>(EPA); Dr. Rashed Hamad Al-Rashoud, EPA Deputy Director </p><p>General; and Captain Ali Haider of the Sea Pollution </p><p>Monitoring Department.  The EPA overseas the new Committee, </p><p>which appointed Haider to supervise one of three </p><p>environmental response stations monitoring for oil slicks, </p><p>marine disruption, and air pollution resulting from an Iraqi </p><p>strike or terrorist attack inside Kuwait. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>BACKGROUND </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  Iraq\'s destruction in 1991 of Kuwait\'s oil fields and the </p><p>consequent damage to the air and sea represents possibly the </p><p>most intense environmental attack any country has ever </p><p>endured.  Using the environment as a weapon, retreating Iraqi </p><p>troops set hundreds of oil wells ablaze, turning Kuwait\'s sky </p><p>black for days and causing billions of dollars in damage. </p><p>The resulting catastrophe took a multi-national team months </p><p>to clean up, while shattering Kuwait\'s economy, devastating </p><p>its infrastructure, and contributing to the country\'s </p><p>standing today among the world\'s worst environments.  (Kuwait </p><p>ranked dead last out of 142 countries examined in the 2002 </p><p>Environmental Sustainability Index conducted annually by </p><p>Columbia and Yale Universities.).  Ever mindful of its shared </p><p>borders with Iraq, including coastline on the Persian Gulf </p><p>and a major oil field, Kuwait has folded the environment into </p><p>its wider contingency plans. </p><p> </p><p>4. Unlike 1990, when Kuwait was caught off guard by Iraq\'s </p><p>invasion, the GOK is now preparing for the worst.  In </p><p>mid-February, Kuwait\'s Ministry of Defense declared the </p><p>northern three-fourths of the country a "military exclusion </p><p>zone," restricting entry.  Kuwait\'s Civil Defense Department </p><p>instigated a "We Are Ready" campaign to keep citizens </p><p>informed, including how to stock home shelters and to deal </p><p>with chemical or biological attacks.  Government and private </p><p>offices are conducting mock evacuation drills.  Extra </p><p>security forces are on the streets.  Weapons, gas masks, and </p><p>chem-bio suits are selling in local stores.  Food ration </p><p>cards have been promised to 150,000 families.  Hospitals are </p><p>stockpiling medical supplies.  Quick intervention teams have </p><p>been placed in schools.  And everyone from oil companies to </p><p>the Kuwait Stock Exchange to the Public Department of Civil </p><p>Aviation is hastily making plans for whatever happens next. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5. After nearly six months of discussions, the GOK announced </p><p>February 23 that it had formed an Emergency Response </p><p>Committee to address environmental protection measures. </p><p>(Note.  Starting in October 2002, Post began asking the EPA </p><p>whether it was preparing for potential environmental threats </p><p>from Iraq and was repeatedly given vague answers of how </p><p>contingency plans were in the works but not yet finalized. </p><p>End Note.)  The Committee participants, in addition to the </p><p>EPA, include representatives from Kuwait\'s Civil Defense </p><p>Department, Ministry of Public Works, Ministry of Electricity </p><p>and Water, Kuwait Institute for Scientific Research (KISR), </p><p>oil companies, and other government agencies. </p><p> </p><p>6. The EPA has allocated 500,000 Kuwait Dinars (about USD </p><p>$1.5 million) for Committee purposes, including the purchase </p><p>of emergency equipment and the staffing of 23 emergency rooms </p><p>throughout the country.  The Committee\'s contingency plan </p><p>also involves the creation and operation of three larger </p><p>emergency stations designed to collect data and report </p><p>findings to a National Emergency Committee, which is led by </p><p>the Ministry of Interior and is responsible for alerting the </p><p>wider populace.  Under this scheme, the GOK intends to </p><p>respond to environmental emergencies in the following areas </p><p>of oil, water, and air: </p><p> </p><p>OIL </p><p>--- </p><p>7. The Ministry of Oil and subsidiaries of Kuwait Petroleum </p><p>Corporation (KPC) have prepared their own contingency plans, </p><p>which involve protecting oil fields, refineries, and tankers </p><p>from an Iraqi counterattack, as well as maintaining Kuwait\'s </p><p>OPEC production quota at 2.1 million barrels per day (bpd). </p><p>Potential threats include missile attacks from Iraq, Saddam </p><p>setting fire to his own oil fields on the border, and Iraqi </p><p>sleeper cells or other militant groups operating inside </p><p>Kuwait.  Should an oil fire break out, the GOK has contracted </p><p>two international companies that specialize in extinguishing </p><p>such blazes.  The Kuwaiti Fire Fighters Team has also </p><p>received special training for oil fires and was recently </p><p>placed on 24-hour alert status. </p><p> </p><p>8.  On March 3, Kuwait Oil Company (KOC) announced that the </p><p>Abdali and Riqqa oil fields near Kuwait\'s northern border </p><p>with Iraq were shutting down and transferring workers for </p><p>personal safety.  KOC Board Chairman and Managing Director </p><p>Ahmad Rashid Al-Arbeed said all northern oil fields would be </p><p>shut down in the event of war on Iraq, and other oil fields, </p><p>such as Al-Rawdhatein and Al-Sabriya further south, would </p><p>increase production to compensate for the roughly 400,000 bpd </p><p>capacity of the northern fields.  Closure of western </p><p>production areas, where the 300,000 bpd capacity Manaqeeesh </p><p>oil field is situated, was also a possibility, Arbeed said. </p><p>(A March 12 statement by KPC\'s chairman denied war would </p><p>interrupt any operations, adding that Kuwait is currently </p><p>producing its maximum 2.4 million bpd). </p><p> </p><p>9.  Meanwhile, US and other allied vessels operating in the </p><p>Gulf have agreed to protect Kuwaiti tankers against any </p><p>bombings, similar to those which damaged the USS Cole and the </p><p>French oil tanker Limburg.  Bahrain-based US Navy spokesman </p><p>Josh Frey told Kuwaiti press March 5 that "we have assets in </p><p>the sea and in the air to monitor shipping in the </p><p>international waters of the Central Command area of </p><p>responsibility."  Frey said many US and other allied ships </p><p>were available, if necessary.  Kuwait oil analyst Kamal </p><p>Al-Harami said he was confident that US and allied naval </p><p>ships will protect oil tankers in the Gulf and that the </p><p>thousands of US and British troops deployed in the Kuwaiti </p><p>desert near Iraq will provide a buffer for oil fields and </p><p>refineries. </p><p> </p><p>WATER </p><p>----- </p><p>10. Oil also threatens Kuwait\'s coastline and marine </p><p>environment.  The US Coast Guard has brought in equipment to </p><p>contain oil spills, either initiated by Iraq from its own </p><p>shores or from tankers placed in the Gulf.  EPA\'s Dr. Sarawi </p><p>said Kuwait is equipped to handle spills ranging from 7,000 </p><p>to 10,000 barrels by combining efforts of the oil sector, </p><p>Ministry of Electricity and Water, Ministry of Defense, </p><p>Kuwaiti Coast Guard, and Port Authority.  For oil spills </p><p>larger than 10,000 barrels, the GOK will rely on outside </p><p>sources, including the Bahrain-based Marine Emergency Mutual </p><p>Aid Center (MEMAC) and the UK-based Oil Spill Response, Ltd </p><p>(OSRAL). Dr. Sarawi said the GOK has signed memorandums of </p><p>understanding with oil companies operating in Kuwait and with </p><p>other states in the region, including Iran, to share </p><p>equipment and expertise in case of a large emergency. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  During the Gulf War, oil flooding and toxic fumes </p><p>severely affected Kuwait\'s marine wildlife, including killing </p><p>many of fish, sea turtles, and aquatic plants.  To minimize </p><p>further damage, Ali Haider of the Sea Pollution Monitoring </p><p>Department said that a special emergency response station, </p><p>the first of its kind in the Middle East, was being </p><p>established near Kuwait\'s Shuaiba Port to monitor marine </p><p>pollution and address environmental problems caused by oil </p><p>slicks.  Should oil or other toxic agents be released in the </p><p>Gulf, the EPA has contracted a $1 million Canadian boat to </p><p>collect and dispose of dead fish, in an effort to protect the </p><p>remaining sea population. </p><p> </p><p>AIR </p><p>--- </p><p>12. Dr. Sarawi said EPA headquarters serves as the hub for </p><p>monitoring Kuwait\'s air quality, including rapid </p><p>identification of any foreign substances entering the </p><p>atmosphere.  The EPA relies on six fixed stations located in </p><p>industrial, urban, and desert areas throughout country, which </p><p>have been taking readings every five minutes over the last 15 </p><p>years on the level of pollutants in the air.  Three mobile </p><p>labs roam Kuwait taking similar samples, as well as noting </p><p>deviations in the weather.  EPA Director of Air Pollution Dr. </p><p>Saud Al-Rashid told local press that the GOK is working to </p><p>"enhance its efforts to counter any hazardous situation in </p><p>Kuwait." </p><p> </p><p>13.   Toward this end, Dr. Salim Al-Hajraf of KISR recently </p><p>unveiled a real time response model designed to address </p><p>environmental pollution in any part of the country.  Dr. </p><p>Al-Hajraf said the computerized model acquires information on </p><p>pollution in a given place, compares data on gases in the </p><p>atmosphere, and transfers the findings to the EPA\'s central </p><p>data bank, where experts determine the best way to address </p><p>the pollution.  One shortcoming, Dr. Sarawi noted, is that </p><p>the EPA does not possess equipment necessary to recognize </p><p>chemical or biological agents, and must rely on American and </p><p>Czech specialists to share such information.  Should Iraq </p><p>launch missiles into Kuwait, the GOK has established an alarm </p><p>system to notify people on what safety measures they should </p><p>follow, such as taking cover in one of the many shelters </p><p>dispersed throughout the country. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>PROPERLY PREPARED? </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>14.  On March 1, Kuwait\'s Minister of Justice Ahmed </p><p>Al-Abdullah said during a seminar titled "Security of </p><p>Citizens under the Present Circumstances" that the GOK has </p><p>made adequate preparations to face any emergency in the event </p><p>of hostilities.  On the environmental front, Dr. Sarawi said </p><p>in a meeting last week attended by public and private </p><p>enterprises that the EPA is now ready to meet any disaster in </p><p>Kuwait.  This week the Emergency Response Committee plans to </p><p>issue more than 5,000 copies of an 80-page magazine called </p><p>"Our Environment," which will carry features on chemical and </p><p>biological weapons, preparations for emergency shelters, and </p><p>other precautionary advise. </p><p> </p><p>15. The EPA has also appointed an official spokesman to </p><p>coordinate with the media and to inform the public of </p><p>developments, as well as  providing three hotline numbers </p><p>manned 24 hours a day to field questions.  Nevertheless, EPA </p><p>officials have their doubts whether most Kuwaitis are </p><p>properly preparing themselves for future events.  Beyond </p><p>military personnel, only a small percentage of people own gas </p><p>masks, nor do they have adequate protection or supplies at </p><p>their homes, Dr. Sarawi said.  His deputy Al-Rashoud added: </p><p>"Everyone here is putting his faith in God and America.  They </p><p>figure the US Military can deal with the worst problems, so </p><p>why should they care?" </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>17. Despite typical early inertia, the GOK has finally begun </p><p>paying attention to the potential threat posed by Saddam </p><p>Hussein reaping revenge on Kuwait through its fragile and </p><p>vulnerable environment.  The Emergency Response Committee has </p><p>made strides coordinating key players in this effort, </p><p>including inviting Post to participate in its next </p><p>inter-agency planning meeting.  As in most other security </p><p>matters, Kuwait will need to rely heavily on the US and </p><p>others to protect its environment in the face of an Iraqi </p><p>attack.  It is encouraging, however, to see the Kuwaitis </p><p>cooperating in this respect to support the greater US cause, </p><p>as they have done consistently in other areas of concern. </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
