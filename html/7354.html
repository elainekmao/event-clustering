<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 000671 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS </p><p>LONDON FOR POL - GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/10/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PREL, EU, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPALI MAOISTS MEET WITH EU MISSION HEAD </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) KATHMANDU 0621 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMB MICHAEL E. MALINOWSKI.  REASON:  1.5(B,D). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  The head of the European Union office in Kathmandu </p><p>broke ranks with his diplomatic colleagues and met with </p><p>Maoist ideologue Baburam Bhattarai and other Maoist leaders </p><p>in Kathmandu on April 10.  The EU Charge justified his </p><p>"spontaneous" decision to meet the insurgent leader on </p><p>humanitarian grounds, in order to stress the importance of </p><p>allowing EU-sponsored development work to proceed unhindered </p><p>in the countryside.  He also argued that since he does not </p><p>hold the rank of Ambassador, his meeting did not confer undue </p><p>legitimacy on the insurgents.  While other diplomatic </p><p>missions contacted by the Maoists, including our own Embassy, </p><p>have not yet responded to Maoist requests for similar </p><p>meetings, all agree that any meeting should take place below </p><p>the level of Ambassador or Charge.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>EU TETE-A-TETE WITH MILITANTS </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  Maoist insurgent leaders, who have been seeking </p><p>meetings with the heads of the US, UK, Indian, Chinese, and </p><p>EU Missions in Kathmandu for the past week (reftel), scored </p><p>their first victory when Charge d\'Affaires Rudiger Wenk, who </p><p>heads the Delegation of the European Commission in Nepal, met </p><p>Maoist ideologue Baburam Bhattarai in Kathmandu on April 10. </p><p>Bhattarai, named by the insurgents to coordinate dialogue </p><p>with the Government of Nepal (GON), was accompanied to the </p><p>meeting by fellow Central Committee members Ram Bahadur </p><p>"Badal" Thapa and Krishna Mahara.  A gaggle of reporters </p><p>followed the Maoists to the EU building, but were prevented </p><p>from entering the compound. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>MEETING DEFENDED ON PROTOCOL, HUMANITARIAN GROUNDS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Wenk told the DCM the following day that his decision </p><p>to meet the Maoists was a "spontaneous" one that he defended </p><p>on both humanitarian and protocol grounds.  He felt it </p><p>important to communicate to the Maoist leadership the </p><p>difficulty of continuing EU-sponsored development projects in </p><p>rural areas affected by the insurgency.  Noting that the </p><p>Maoists had burned a number of EU project vehicles in some </p><p>areas, he added that he had wanted to meet with them for some </p><p>time on the matter but could not obtain clearance from the EU </p><p>hierarchy to do so.  When he was contacted with the request </p><p>on the morning of April 10, he thus decided to use the </p><p>opportunity to press those points.  (Note:  Wenk said he had </p><p>been informally contacted before the day of the meeting </p><p>through "leftist channels," but had not recieved the same </p><p>form letter as had the US, UK, Indian and Chinese Embassies </p><p>asking for an appointment.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Because he does not hold the rank of Ambassador, Wenk </p><p>further reasoned, his meeting the Maoists would not confer </p><p>undue status or legitimacy on the insurgents.  Because the </p><p>European Commission is "strictly apolitical," he contended, </p><p>the Maoists cannot exploit the meeting for political ends. </p><p>He added that he provided his interlocutors with a detailed </p><p>explanation of the EU\'s organization--differentiating between </p><p>the EU and the European Commission and pointing out that the </p><p>EU Ambassador is in New Delhi and that Wenk is Charge only </p><p>for the Commission--to underscore his comparatively modest </p><p>rank.  (Note:  These subtleties were apparently lost on the </p><p>Maoists, whose press statements after the meeting crowed that </p><p>the "EU envoy" had met them.  End note.)  He did not alert </p><p>the EU Ambassador in New Delhi, EU headquarters, the Chiefs </p><p>of Mission of EU member nations in Kathmandu, or the GON </p><p>before meeting with the Maoists.  Wenk added that the British </p><p>Ambassador was angry (as are we) when he learned of the </p><p>meeting through the local press.  He promised to brief the </p><p>Foreign Ministry on the meeting next week. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>MAOISTS\' MESSAGE </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  Wenk described the atmosphere of the meeting as </p><p>"friendly" and "relaxed."  The Maoists\' main message, </p><p>according to Wenk, was their dissatisfaction with the GON\'s </p><p>alleged lack of cooperation in the peace process.  They also </p><p>expressed concern about "foreign intervention" in Nepal, </p><p>particularly military assistance.  Wenk said he replied that </p><p>the EU Parliament had passed a resolution in 2002 offering to </p><p>mediate in the conflict between the Maoists and the GON, but </p><p>had received no response.  His Maoist interlocutors blamed </p><p>India and China for squelching any efforts at third-party </p><p>mediation.  (Comment:  Wenk either ignores or is ignorant of </p><p>the sensitivities regarding international mediation here. </p><p>The GON--and the Indians--have a well-known position in </p><p>rejecting international mediation at this time.)  The DCM </p><p>asked if Wenk had pressed the Maoists to work with the </p><p>Parliamentary parties.  Bhattarai had assured him that the </p><p>Maoists support multiparty democracy, Wenk answered, but </p><p>would never join the current interim government. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  Wenk told the DCM he did not rely solely on </p><p>previously cleared EU guidance in his discussion with the </p><p>Maoists.  (According to the UK Ambassador, this guidance </p><p>stipulated that any discussion take place below the level of </p><p>Ambassador; that EU representatives be in "listening mode"; </p><p>that discussion be limited to development topics; and that </p><p>there be no publicity.)  For example, when the Maoists told </p><p>him that they intended to publicize the meeting, he </p><p>acquiesced, stipulating only that they provide the press with </p><p>an accurate read-out.  (Note:  The Maoists appear, for the </p><p>most part, to have done so.  According to Wenk, the only </p><p>inaccuracy--so far--in the press account was the assertion </p><p>that he had "pledged every kind of assistance to the rebels" </p><p>in their efforts toward peace.  End note.)  The DCM asked if </p><p>Wenk pursued with his interlocutors their frequent threats to </p><p>break the ceasefire and return to violence if the GON fails </p><p>to meet their demands.  Wenk replied that he understands the </p><p>Maoists\' frustration, charging that the GON is trying to </p><p>"starve them out" by delaying the beginning of negotiations. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>OTHER EMBASSIES\' REACTIONS </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Since receiving the Maoists\' request (reftel), we </p><p>have polled other Embassies to hear their views on meeting </p><p>the Maoists.  Like us, the British and Indians believe any </p><p>meeting should take place at a mid-level.  The UK Embassy has </p><p>received clearance from FCO to hold a meeting at that level, </p><p>but, like us, is in no hurry to respond to the Maoist </p><p>invitation.  The Indians have not yet received guidance from </p><p>New Delhi.  The Chinese are not contemplating a meeting at </p><p>any level because, according to First Secretary Cheng Ji, </p><p>they have no wish to interfere in Nepal\'s internal affairs. </p><p>The Japanese have not been requested to meet. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  The Maoists have been publicizing in the media their </p><p>requests to meet with heads of prominent foreign missions, </p><p>and have been more than a little chagrined at the cool </p><p>reception to their invitations.  The meeting with Wenk, which </p><p>was not briefed to the GON in advance and was not sanctioned </p><p>either by the EU hierarchy, his EU supervisor in New Delhi, </p><p>or by EU member Embassies in Nepal, has provided the Maoists </p><p>some face-saving cover.  Wenk\'s diplomatic irresponsibility, </p><p>his apparent sympathy for the Maoists\' viewpoint and his </p><p>acceptance of their political pretensions at face value </p><p>betray a surprising naivete about the insurgents\' real aims </p><p>and intentions.  We will continue to coordinate closely with </p><p>other diplomatic missions on any eventual meetings. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
