<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 RANGOON 000168 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p>CINCPAC FOR FPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/04/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PINR, PREL, BM </p><p>SUBJECT: REGIME NAMES CHANGE, GAME REMAINS THE SAME </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: COM CARMEN M. MARTINEZ FOR REASON 1.5(D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU)  Summary:  The State Peace and Development Council </p><p>(SPDC)  announced on February 1 the selection of a new </p><p>"Secretary 2" and the rotation, including two retirements, of </p><p>several regime ministers.  The outgoing ministers won\'t be </p><p>missed.  The incoming Secretary 2 may eventually establish </p><p>himself as a successor to Secretary 1.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>A New Secretary 2 - Lt. Gen. Soe Win </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  On February 1, the SPDC announced that Lt. General </p><p>Soe Win had been assigned as Secretary 2 in the junta.  The </p><p>Secretary 2 post (the fourth most senior position in the </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>junta) had been vacant since February 2001, when Lt. General </p><p>Tin Oo was killed in a helicopter accident.  Soe Win, who is </p><p>approximately 50, worked his way up through various military </p><p>commands before being promoted to Brigadier General in 1996 </p><p>as Commander of the North-West Region.  In 1997, he became a </p><p>member of the junta during its transition from the State Law </p><p>and Order Committee (SLORC) to the SPDC.  In November 2001, </p><p>he was promoted to Air Defense Commander.  He also serves as </p><p>one of the Patrons of the Union Solidarity and Development </p><p>Association (USDA), a mass organization used as a base of </p><p>political support by the SPDC. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  Lt. General Soe Win is not very well known, and </p><p>appears to have made his name through allegiance and dutiful </p><p>service rather than exceptional performance.  The North-West </p><p>Command is SPDC Vice Chairman Maung Aye\'s home turf and it is </p><p>believed that Soe Win is closer to the military side of the </p><p>junta (General Maung Aye) than to the intelligence side </p><p>(General Khin Nyunt).  Ultimately, of course, all are </p><p>currently under the firm hand of Senior General Than Shwe. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  In late January, Soe Win was in the press for the </p><p>first time since his promotion in 2001.  The Democratic Voice </p><p>of Burma reported that he told a USDA meeting in Pyay that </p><p>the SPDC would not talk to or hand over power to the NLD. </p><p>According to the DVB, he urged the gathered USDA members and </p><p>civil servants to not have any contact with the NLD and to </p><p>continue in their service to the country. </p><p> </p><p>New Ministers </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  Effective February 2, the SPDC also retired Minister </p><p>of Health Major General Ket Sein and Minister of Finance and </p><p>Revenue U Khin Maung Thein and transferred Minister of Rail </p><p>Transportation U Pan Aung to the Prime Minister\'s Office. </p><p>Major General Aung Min replaced U Pan Aung as Minister of </p><p>Rail Transportation.  Major General Aung Min is married to </p><p>the sister of the newly installed Minister for Economic </p><p>Planning and Economic Development, U Soe Tha, who in turn is </p><p>reportedly close to Than Shwe.  This family connection may </p><p>partly explain the change. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C)  The new Minister of Health, Dr. Kyaw Myint, is a </p><p>physician who has served as a Deputy Minister and a Director </p><p>General in the Ministry of Health.  He is well regarded by </p><p>NGOs and UN officials here and served as Chairman of the WHO </p><p>Executive Board in Geneva last year.  His main qualification </p><p>for the minister\'s position, however, is that he has served </p><p>as personal physician to Senior General Than Shwe and his </p><p>family.  We have no information available yet on the new </p><p>Minister of Finance and Revenue, Major General Hla Tun. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C)  The SPDC also announced on February 2 that it was </p><p>increasing the number of Deputy Chief Justices from two to </p><p>three and the number of Supreme Court Justices from eight to </p><p>twelve.  According to the GoB, an interest in "smooth and </p><p>speedy administration of justice in the interest of the </p><p>people..." lay behind the additional appointments.  In the </p><p>Attorney General\'s office the number of Deputy Attorneys </p><p>General was increased from one to three. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p> </p><p>8. (C)  As usual, it is not clear what lies behind all these </p><p>changes, but a couple of general points can be made.  First, </p><p>these promotions and retirements are standard practice as the </p><p>SPDC has frequently rotated senior military officers among </p><p>the 93 SPDC, minister, or deputy minister positions. </p><p>Meanwhile, the NLD and other political parties have largely </p><p>maintained the leadership structures that were in place at </p><p>the time of the 1990 election.  As a result, the generational </p><p>contrast between leadership in the SPDC and that in the </p><p>opposition parties (most of whom are Ne Win contemporaries) </p><p>is becoming increasingly stark. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C)  Secondly, the appointment of a new Secretary 2 gives </p><p>Secretary 1 Khin Nyunt two potential successors - Major </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>General Kyaw Win at military intelligence and Lt. General Soe </p><p>Win at the SPDC.  If he is now sidelined, the powers he holds </p><p>could well be split. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C)  As for the ministers, neither the outgoing Minister </p><p>of Finance nor the departing Minister of Health is going to </p><p>be missed.  Both presided over institutions that were </p><p>national disgraces.  The Ministry of Finance, through its </p><p>inability to manage the budget was the prime culprit in the </p><p>inflationary surge that has threatened to overwhelm Burma\'s </p><p>economy over the past two years, while the Ministry of </p><p>Health\'s management of the health system earned Burma the </p><p>booby prize in the WHO\'s ranking of national health systems </p><p>in 1999.  The new appointees may do no better but the </p><p>incumbents were proved failures. </p><p> </p><p>11. (C)  Finally, the additional justices, deputy justices </p><p>and deputy attorneys general may reflect some incipient </p><p>interest in law reform and the use of legal processes in </p><p>Burma.  This does not mean, of course, that the regime will </p><p>not always get its way, but it does mean they may become a </p><p>little more adept in moving the case load now burdening the </p><p>courts, and in finding the appropriate legal pretext for its </p><p>moves.  End Comment. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
