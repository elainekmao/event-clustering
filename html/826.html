THE STATUS OF WOMEN </p><p>THROUGHOUT THE SADC REGION, IN VARIOUS RESPECTS, CAN ONLY </p><p>BE DEEMED SECOND-CLASS. IN MANY COUNTRIES WOMEN SUFFER </p><p>DISCRIMINATION IN TERMS OF BOTH LAW AND PRACTICE. EVEN IN </p><p>STATES IN WHICH GENDER EQUALITY IS MANDATED BY THE </p><p>CONSTITUTION OR LEGISLATION, WOMEN STRUGGLE AGAINST THE </p><p>FORMIDABLE FORCES OF SOCIETAL CUSTOM AND TRADITION. </p><p>POSTS HUMAN RIGHTS REPORTS HAVE DETAILED MANY ONGOING </p><p>SUCH PROBLEMS, ESPECIALLY IN THE AREAS OF INHERITANCE, </p><p>PROPERTY OWNERSHIP, FINANCIAL/CONTRACTUAL RIGHTS, AND THE </p><p>ABILITY TO PASS CITIZENSHIP TO CHILDREN. </p><p> </p><p>3.

AT THE BEIJING CONFERENCE </p><p>DELEGATIONS FROM THE SADC COUNTRIES PROVIDED SURPRISINGLY </p><p>STRONG AND DYNAMIC LEADERSHIP IN THIS AREA. WE HOPE TO </p><p>BUILD ON THIS SOLID FOUNDATION AND NOT ALLOW THE MOMENTUM </p><p>GENERATED AT BEIJING TO WANE. </p><p> </p><p>4. ACTION REQUEST: WE WOULD APPRECIATE RESPONSES TO THE </p><p>FOLLOWING QUERIES REGARDING THE STATUS OF WOMEN IN HOST </p><p>COUNTRIES TO HELP US MORE FULLY GRASP THE CURRENT </p><p>SITUATION AND TO GAUGE WHAT WE MIGHT PRODUCTIVELY DO IN </p><p>THIS AREA. </p><p> </p><p>-- IS THERE ANY CURRENT LEGISLATION THAT DISCRIMINATES </p><p>AGAINST WOMEN? IF SO, HOW? </p><p> </p><p>-- WHAT IS THE LEGAL STATUS OF "CUSTOMARY LAW" REGARDING </p><p>WOMEN?  IF "CUSTOMARY LAW" AND MODERN STATUTE VARY, HOW </p><p>ARE DIFFERENCES RESOLVED? </p><p> </p><p>-- WHAT ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT AREAS OF DIVERGENCE, IF </p><p>ANY, BETWEEN LAW AND PRACTICE REGARDING THE LEGAL STATUS </p><p>OF WOMEN? </p><p> </p><p>-- HAS THE HOST GOVERNMENT PUBLICLY COMMITTED TO IMPLEMENT </p><p>THE PLAN OF ACTION FROM THE BEIJING CONFERENCE? </p><p> </p><p>-- IF SO, WHAT STEPS HAVE BEEN TAKEN? WOULD AN </p><p>INFORMATION-GATHERNING QUERY FROM YOUR EMBASSY SPUR ACTION? </p><p> </p><p>-- IF NOT, WOULD IT HELP FOR YOU TO RAISE THE ISSUE WITH </p><p>HOST-GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS? </p><p> </p><p>-- ARE THERE ANY ADDITIONAL WAYS YOUR POST COULD UTILIZE </p><p>116(E), SELF-HELP, D/G PROGRAMS, ETC TO SUPPORT PROGRESS </p><p>IN THIS AREA? WHAT HAVE YOU FOUND TO BE MOST EFFECTIVE? </p><p>HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THESE PROGRAMS BY </p><p>PROMOTING THEM THROUGH PUBLIC DIPLOMACY, SUCH AS BY PUBLIC </p><p> </p><p>ANNOUNCEMENTS OR CEREMONIES TO MARK PROGRAM FUND AWARDS? </p><p>-- FOR GABORONE:  WHAT, IF ANYTHING, IS SADC DOING TO </p><p>FOLLOW-THROUGH ON THE BEIJING CONFERENCE? IS POST IN </p><p>CONTACT WITH SADC SECRETARIAT ON THIS ISSUE? WILL IT BE </p><p>ON THE AGENDA OF THE AUGUST SADC SUMMIT IN MASERU? </p><p> </p><p>-- FOR GABORONE:  TO WHAT EXTENT IS THE SOUTHERN AFRICA </p><p>REGIONAL DEMOCRATIZATION FUND PROMOTING THE STATUS OF </p><p>WOMEN IN THE AREA? (NOTE: COULD SARDF, FOR EXAMPLE, HELP </p><p>NETWORK NGO LEADERS IN NAMIBIA, WHO RECENTLY CARRIED THE </p><p>DAY IN THEIR LANDMARK LEGISLATIVE EFFORT, WITH </p><p>COUNTERPARTS ELSEWHERE IN THE REGION?) </p><p> </p><p>-- WHAT COULD THE DEPARTMENT, ALONE OR IN CONJUNCTION WITH </p><p>YOUR POST (BEARING IN MIND OUR BUDGETARY SITUATION), DO TO </p><p>IMPROVE THE STATUS OF WOMEN IN THE SADC REGION? </p><p> </p><p>S.
