(U) CLASSIFIED BY ACTING PRINCIPAL OFFICER JERRY FEIERSTEIN, </p><p>REASON 1.6X1. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S) OSAMA BIN LADEN HAS CLOSE CONNECTIONS TO, AND POSSIBLY AN </p><p>OWNERSHIP SHARE OF, AL-AQSA ISLAMIC BANK, A NEW BANK GIVEN </p><p>PRELIMINARY APPROVAL BY THE PALESTINIAN MONETARY AUTHORITY (PMA) TO </p><p>OPERATE IN PALESTINIAN AREAS, ACCORDING TO PROMINENT WEST BANK </p><p>BUSINESSMAN AND BANKER YAHYA KADAMANI (STRICTLY PROTECT).  KADAMANI </p><p>SAID AUGUST 25 THAT AL-AQSA IS JOINTLY OWNED BY THE JORDAN ISLAMIC </p><p>BANK (JIB) AND BEIT AL MAL, A PALESTINIAN ISLAMIC FINANCIAL </p><p>INSTITUTION.  JIB, IN TURN, IS OWNED BY A SAUDI SHEIKH NAMED </p><p>SA\'ADEH KAMEL, A FRIEND AND BUSINESS PARTNER OF BIN LADEN\'S, SAID </p><p>KADAMANI. </p><p> </p><p>3.

(S) COMMENT.  KADAMANI IS A LONG-TIME CONSULATE CONTACT AND IS </p><p>WELL PLUGGED-IN TO PALESTINIAN FINANCIAL CIRCLES.  HE HAS ALWAYS </p><p>BEEN VERY OPEN, AND IS SOMETHING OF A GOSSIP-MONGER.  WE DON\'T TAKE </p><p>KADAMANI\'S REMARKS AS PROOF OF A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BIN LADEN AND </p><p>AL-AQSA, BUT BELIEVE THEY ARE WORTH NOTING.  END COMMENT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FEIERSTEIN </p><p></p></div>
