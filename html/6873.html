<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 002018 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/27/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, TU, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: REPORT OF GROWING WAR ANXIETY IN TURKEY\'S KURDISH </p><p>SOUTHEAST </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ANKARA 1631 </p><p>     B. ANKARA 1740 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Polcouns John Kunstadter; reasons: 1.5 </p><p>(b)(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: Kurdish M.P. from Diyarbakir who is also a </p><p>member of opposition CHP\'s Central Administrative Board has </p><p>elaborated on concerns expressed to us recently by other </p><p>Kurdish politicians (ref A) regarding fallout in southeastern </p><p>Turkey from the war in Iraq.  Moreover, he asserted that (1) </p><p>there is a growing sense among Kurds that the war in Iraq is </p><p>going poorly and (2) a growing number of Kurds in Diyarbakir </p><p>view the conflict in increasingly stark, "Islamic" terms. </p><p>End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) A Kurdish M.P. from "secular" CHP -- one of the few </p><p>straight shooters we know in that party -- asserted to us </p><p>March 27 that the initial positive sentiment about the war in </p><p>Iraq has faded among many Kurds in Turkey\'s Southeast.  He </p><p>claimed the mood in Diyarbakir, the region\'s largest city and </p><p>our contact\'s hometown, is one of "controlled panic." </p><p>Diyarbakir Kurds, he averred, "are genuinely concerned that </p><p>the U.S. will bomb them.  Even if Iraq shoots a missile </p><p>against Diyarbakir, people will blame the U.S."  Our contact </p><p>recognizes the absurdity of such a fear but believes it comes </p><p>from a growing sense -- fanned by local religious leaders -- </p><p>that the U.S. is conducting a war against Islam.  "You must </p><p>take care not to bomb religious sites in Iraq," he warned, </p><p>"or you will risk greater opposition in the Southeast." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Moreover, the M.P. noted that many in the Southeast </p><p>may not support the war because of familial and tribal ties </p><p>to the terrorist PKK/KADEK.  He noted that his own brother </p><p>had joined the PKK in 1988 at the age of 15, though he has </p><p>not been seen since.  Kurds, he said, fear that whatever </p><p>post-Saddam regime emerges in Iraq, it will at a minimum </p><p>exclude PKK/KADEK from a place at the table and may even </p><p>attempt to destroy it.  Consequently, the pro-PKK/KADEK </p><p>Kurdish Medya TV, he said, is broadcasting this concern. </p><p>(Comment: In one of the ironies of the current political </p><p>situation, we note that numerous senior figures in the </p><p>pro-Kurdish DEHAP and defunct HADEP parties, both with a </p><p>relationship to PKK/KADEK akin to that of Sinn Fein with the </p><p>IRA, have eagerly expressed to us privately their support for </p><p>USG actions in Iraq.  End comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>Comment: The Kurdish Dilemma </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Our senior CHP contact\'s comments emphasize different </p><p>aspects of the situation than the views espoused by some of </p><p>our other leading (pro-Barzani) Kurdish contacts, including </p><p>those in CHP.  On the one hand, they reflect diffuse </p><p>tolerance of PKK/KADEK, not because it is a terrorist </p><p>organization but because "these are our sons."  Second, in </p><p>previous, more official settings, this particular contact has </p><p>been careful to enunciate the CHP line -- even as he </p><p>simultaneously expressed hope that the USG war effort will </p><p>succeed in improving conditions for Kurds in Iraq.  As a </p><p>secularist, however, he is also more prone to warn against </p><p>rising Islamic sentiment than his more traditional brethren. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) As a whole, Kurds are more openly religious than </p><p>ethnic Turkish citizens.  While this helps foster a sense of </p><p>the Kurds as distinct from, and victims of, the "Kemalist" </p><p>Turks, it also makes many susceptible to pan-Islamic </p><p>arguments that the USG is leading a "Crusade" against Muslim </p><p>Iraq (ref B).  In this contact\'s view, at least, there is a </p><p>growing convergence of interests between some militant </p><p>Islamist elements and far-left nationalists in the Kurdish </p><p>Southeast. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
