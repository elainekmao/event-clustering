<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 NASSAU 000577 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR G/TIP, G, INL, DRL, PRM, IWI, WHA/PCC </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR USAID </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KCRM, PHUM, KWMN, SMIG, KFRD, ASEC, PREF, ELAB, BF, Human Rights </p><p>SUBJECT: BAHAMAS - THRID ANNUAL TRAFFICKING IN </p><p>PERSONS (TIP) REPORT </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) STATE 22225 </p><p> </p><p>OVERVIEW </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  The Bahamas, although rife with alien and drug </p><p>smuggling, has no indications of being a country of </p><p>origin, transit, or destination for international </p><p>trafficking in men, women, or children.  Post </p><p>discussed this issue with governmental sources </p><p>including the Foreign Ministry, The Department of </p><p>Labor, the Royal Bahamian Police Force, the </p><p>Department of Social Services and the Department of </p><p>Immigration, as well as NGOs such as the Red Cross, </p><p>Amnesty International and NOWAB, the national </p><p>women\'s rights organization.    None had any </p><p>evidence of trafficking in persons as defined by </p><p>reftel A.  Post believes these sources to be highly </p><p>credible, as we have worked closely with them in the </p><p>past and they have provided accurate information. </p><p> </p><p>PREVENTION </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  Should anti-trafficking of persons become an </p><p>issue in The Bahamas, The Royal Bahamian Police </p><p>Force, the Departments of Immigration and Labor and </p><p>the Attorney General\'s Office would all be involved. </p><p>The Bahamas has not instituted any anti-trafficking </p><p>information or education programs because </p><p>trafficking in persons has not become a significant </p><p>problem.  To its credit, the government promotes </p><p>women\'s rights and Bahamian women play a prominent </p><p>role in government and private businesses.  Bahamian </p><p>children, required by law to remain in school until </p><p>the age of 16, generally adhere to this rule and </p><p>therefore are not as vulnerable to human traffickers </p><p>who prey on inactive young children. </p><p> </p><p>3. National finances are limited, but the Bahamian </p><p>government would be willing and able to support </p><p>prevention programs if trafficking in person in </p><p>persons was identified as a significant problem. </p><p>Since neither the NGO community nor the government </p><p>has recognized trafficking as a significant issue, </p><p>little to no interaction on this issue exists </p><p>between them.  However, the government and the NGO </p><p>community have a cordial and cooperativeon </p><p>relationship on other issues. </p><p> </p><p>4. The Bahamas, comprised of more than 700 islands </p><p>covering more than 700 miles, is as an extremely </p><p>porous nation.  With multiple ports of entry - </p><p>formal and informal -- The Bahamas faces a chronic </p><p>border control problem.  For centuries smugglers of </p><p>all types have used the island nations.  Illegal </p><p>immigration and drug trafficking are significant </p><p>problems in the Bahamas.  The government devotes </p><p>serious effort, given limited resources to </p><p>detecting, monitoring and interdicting illegal </p><p>immigrants and works cooperatively with American </p><p>anti-drug forces to interdict narco-traffickers. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>INVESTIGATION AND PROSECUTION OF TRAFFICKERS </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  The Bahamas does not have a law specifically </p><p>prohibiting trafficking in persons.  However, </p><p>traffickers can be prosecuted under Title XIX of the </p><p>penal code - Crimes Against Females, and of </p><p>Kidnapping and Abduction - for attempts to procure </p><p>any female by threats of intimidation, false </p><p>pretenses or by administering drugs.  There are also </p><p>provisions against forcibly taking or detaining a </p><p>female or abduction of females.  Similar laws apply </p><p>to child abduction cases.  Prison terms range from </p><p>two years to life in prison, depending on the crime </p><p>committed.  The penalties for rape or forcible </p><p>sexual assault range from a minimum of seven years </p><p>to a maximum of life imprisonment.  Taken together, </p><p>these laws are adequate to cover the full scope of </p><p>trafficking in persons, if necessary. </p><p> </p><p>6.  In June 2001, the government ratified ILO </p><p>Convention 182 Concerning the Profession and </p><p>Immediate Action for the Elimination of the Worst </p><p>Forms of Child Labor.  The CGOB is a party to the </p><p>Rights of the Child Convention, but not the Sale of </p><p>Children Protocol.  The CGOB is not a party of the </p><p>Protocol to Prevent, Suppress, and Punish </p><p>Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and </p><p>Children, supplementingation the UN Convention </p><p>Against Transnational Organized Crime. </p><p> </p><p>PROECTION AND ASSISTANCE TO VICTIMS </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  The Bahamian government does not provide funds </p><p>to NGOs to protect and assist trafficked person </p><p>because there is no little if any evidence of human </p><p>trafficking.  Analogously, the government does not </p><p>provide specialized training for government </p><p>officials in the provision of assistance to </p><p>trafficked victims, nor does it emphasize the issue </p><p>with its consulates and embassies abroad.  Children </p><p>frequently are amongst those illegal immigrants who </p><p>are detained in The Bahamas, including unaccompanied </p><p>minors.  The Department of Immigration has </p><p>procedures in place to protect these children and to </p><p>deal with their specials needs. </p><p> </p><p>Blankenship </p><p></p></div>
