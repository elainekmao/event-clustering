STATE 120356 </p><p>     B. STATE 114629 </p><p>     C. ANKARA 2982 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> (U) Classified by A/DCM Scot Marciel.  Reasons:  1.5 (B and </p><p>D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Pol-Mil Counselor delivered Ref A demarche to MFA </p><p>Deputy Director General for the Middle East Safak Gokturk and </p><p>Iraq Deskoff Farhat Alkan May 8.  Gokturk responded by saying </p><p>that the first Turkish convoy (carrying Turkey\'s Ambassador </p><p>to Iraq) had already left Ankara and would cross the Iraqi </p><p>border at Habur the morning of May 9, proceeding from there </p><p>to Baghdad.  The second convoy, carrying their DCM, would </p><p>proceed as planned, crossing into Iraq May 14.  Gokturk said </p><p>the Turks were going back for two reasons: by their count, 17 </p><p>countries already had sent diplomats back to Baghdad; and the </p><p>GOT wanted to have their own eyes and ears in Baghdad now. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Gokturk said he was unaware of any plans to travel </p><p>outside of Baghdad once their staff was back, and said that </p><p>establishing consulates in other cities would be a long-term </p><p>project that would not begin in the near future. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Referring to our point about the Coalition reserving </p><p>the right to expel anyone who interfered with Coalition </p><p>activities, Gokturk said he hoped that point was boilerplate </p><p>for all countries and that we did not anticipate any trouble </p><p>from the Turkish diplomats.  The Turks certainly did not </p><p>intend to create any difficulty for the Coalition. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
