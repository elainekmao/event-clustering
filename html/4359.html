<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 006722 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>TREASURY FOR DAVID LOEVINGER/LARRY MCDONALD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/13/2007 </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, EAID, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDAN: DAS SATTERFIELD DISCUSSES PROPOSED </p><p>ASSISTANCE PACKAGE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMBASSADOR EDWARD W. GNEHM, JR.  REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p>. </p><p> </p><p>1.  (c) Summary.  In meetings with the Jordanian Prime </p><p>Minister and Finance Minister, DAS Satterfield was told that </p><p>answers to the U.S. questions regarding possible supplemental </p><p>economic assistance for Jordan would be ready within the </p><p>coming week.  The ministers agreed that additional U.S. </p><p>assistance could be structured so as to address the basic </p><p>objective of weaning Jordan off its economic dependence on </p><p>the Iraqi oil grant within the framework of its existing IMF </p><p>supported economic program.  While there is a need for </p><p>further discussion of the details of such a transition, both </p><p>the Prime Minister and the Finance Minister accepted the need </p><p>for economic conditionality that supported this objective. </p><p>Both sides acknowledged the need to foster support in the </p><p>U.S. Congress.  The Prime Minister said there had been no </p><p>movement on a proposed Kuwaiti-Saudi-UAE oil package and </p><p>asked for continued U.S. involvement.  The finance minister </p><p>briefed on the positive economic performance so far this </p><p>year.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (c)  DAS Satterfield met separately with Finance Minister </p><p>Michel Marto and Prime Minister Abul Ragheb on November 13 to </p><p>follow-up on the November 1 Jordanian-U.S. discussions in </p><p>Washington of a supplemental assistance package for Jordan. </p><p>Foreign Minister Marwan Muasher joined Abul Ragheb. </p><p>Ambassador Gnehm, Treasury Deputy Office Director Marshall </p><p>Mills, and Econ/c Goldberger accompanied Satterfield. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>Follow-up Questions </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (c)  Abul Ragheb explained that the Jordanian government </p><p>had been working on answers to the five follow-up questions </p><p>that emerged from the Washington meetings.  He said that this </p><p>work was not yet finished, mainly because of uncertainty over </p><p>the intent of the fourth question relating to social spending </p><p>programs.  Satterfield explained that the question was </p><p>looking for reassurance that Jordan would use additional </p><p>resources made available by the United States within its </p><p>existing budgetary structures and targets agreed with the </p><p>IMF.  Additional resources should compensate for revenue </p><p>losses (and perhaps exceptional spending needs) associated </p><p>with the dissolution of Jordan\'s special economic </p><p>relationship with Iraq.  The goal or philosophy behind </p><p>extraordinary assistance would be to facilitate the creation </p><p>of an independent Jordanian economic system that is </p><p>sustainable over the long term, Satterfield said.  As part of </p><p>this, Satterfield stressed the need to establish market </p><p>pricing for petroleum products. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (c)  Both Abul Ragheb and Marto agreed with these </p><p>objectives.  They understood that current fiscal dependence </p><p>on the Iraqi oil grant was not sustainable.  They agreed it </p><p>was necessary to have a plan for making a transition to </p><p>petroleum product prices set by market forces.  They also </p><p>accepted the need for the U.S. to put economic conditions on </p><p>the use of assistance.  Marto in fact welcomed such </p><p>conditionality as giving him additional leverage to promote </p><p>reforms.  Abul Ragheb\'s comments suggested, however, a need </p><p>for further discussions about the details and timing of a </p><p>transition to market prices.  He said, for example, that oil </p><p>produce prices could be raised in annual increments of 7% per </p><p>year for five years (which doesn\'t add up).  (Comment: the </p><p>visiting IMF team told Mills and Goldberger earlier in the </p><p>day that they thought a 50-60% increase in average product </p><p>prices needed to meet world prices could be achieved over two </p><p>to three years.)  Abul Ragheb noted that the Administration </p><p>was considering a multi-year ESF package.  He pointed out </p><p>that the most significant economic consequences of any </p><p>confrontation with Iraq would occur during the first year. </p><p>He argued for maximum disbursals early on. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (c)  Abul Ragheb appreciated the guidance from </p><p>Satterfield and said the he would work to have the answers </p><p>ready by early in the week of November 19.  Abul Ragheb asked </p><p>wither additional assistance would be provided even if there </p><p>were no conflict in Iraq.  Satterfield responded that that it </p><p>was unclear, but that Congressional support would be more </p><p>problematic if there were no conflict.  Mills also said he </p><p>would be available for any further technical discussions. </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>Iraq Debt </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (c)  Abul Ragheb also raised the possibility of </p><p>supplementing U.S. assistance with repayments of what he said </p><p>was the $1.4 billion in old debt owed by Iraq to Jordan.  He </p><p>suggested that if this debt were repaid over five years it </p><p>could help cushion the fiscal impact of having to buy oil at </p><p>market prices.  Satterfield said he would transmit this to </p><p>Washington, but noted that other creditors also had </p><p>significant claims on Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>Oil Package </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (c)  Abul Ragheb also confirmed that there had been no </p><p>new developments regarding the special oil supply package </p><p>suggested by Kuwaiti State Minister Muhammad al-Sabah.  He </p><p>expected that such a package would include concessional </p><p>elements.   King Abdullah had not specifically raised the </p><p>question with Crown Prince Abdullah in Riyadh the day before </p><p>(November 12), although he did receive general assurances of </p><p>Saudi support for Jordanian "brothers." </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>Economic Performance </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (sbu)  Marto briefed on the outcome of the just completed </p><p>IMF mission.  He said that the Fund thought the 2002 annual </p><p>real GDP growth target of 5.1% was attainable and that 2003 </p><p>growth could reach 6%.  Improved performance was based mainly </p><p>on strong export growth, tourism receipts, and remittances. </p><p>(Tourism receipts were 11% more in the first nine months of </p><p>2002 than the same 2001 period, as greater tourism from Arab </p><p>countries more than compensated for a lower number of </p><p>European and U.S. visitors.)  Internal demand, however, </p><p>remained weak.  Marto expected that all of the stand-by </p><p>program\'s year-end performance criteria would be met, despite </p><p>lower than expected fiscal receipts.  He noted that this had </p><p>been achieved despite the uncertainties in the political </p><p>environment and appreciated U.S. economic support, </p><p>particularly for the Program for Social and Economic </p><p>Transformation (PSET).  He said the government was continuing </p><p>to make progress on its structural reform goals, particularly </p><p>those connected with pension reform. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (c)  Satterfield and Mills cleared this message. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
