<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L BOGOTA 006096 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/12/12 </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PGOV, PREL, CO, PINS </p><p>SUBJECT:  COLOMBIAN TERRORISM - DEFENSE OFFICIALS PAINT </p><p>BLEAK PICTURE </p><p> </p><p>1.  CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR CURTIS W. KAMMAN.  REASON </p><p>1.5(B). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  SUMMARY:  COORDINATOR FOR COUNTERTERRORISM MIKE </p><p>SHEEHAN AND ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF DEFENSE (SOLIC) BRIAN </p><p>SHERIDAN MET WITH COLOMBIAN MINISTER OF DEFENSE LUIS </p><p>RAMIREZ, THE COMMANDER OF MILITARY FORCES FERNANDO TAPIAS, </p><p>AND THE CHIEFS OF THE VARIOUS ARMED SERVICE BRANCHES. </p><p>SHEEHAN AND SHERIDAN ASKED THE MILITARY LEADERS HOW THE USG </p><p>COULD BEST SEND THE MESSAGE THAT THE USG WILL NOT TOLERATE </p><p>FARC AND OTHER VIOLENCE WITHOUT SHOWING THAT THE USG IS </p><p>FEARFUL OF FARC RETALIATION.  THE COLOMBIAN MILITARY </p><p>LEADERS USED THE FORUM TO DESCRIBE THE MULTITUDE OF </p><p>PROBLEMS THEY FACE IN TRYING TO ELIMINATE COLOMBIAN </p><p>TERRORIST GROUPS, OFTEN VENTING THEIR FRUSTRATION.  THOSE </p><p>AT THE TABLE CITED DISTURBING NEW TRENDS IN THE KIDNAPPING </p><p>INDUSTRY AS THE FINANCIAL ENGINE OF THE TERRORIST GROUPS </p><p>AND TROUBLING EVIDENCE THAT EVEN THE PARAMILITARY GROUPS </p><p>WHOSE STATED MISSION IS TO FIGHT LEFTIST TERRORISTS ARE </p><p>RESORTING TO THE SAME TERROR TACTICS USED BY THEIR ENEMIES. </p><p>TAPIAS NOTED THAT THE PARAMILITARIES\' STRENGTH EXCEEDED </p><p>THAT OF THE ELN, AND WOULD EVENTUALLY ECLIPSE THE FARC AS </p><p>WELL.  SHEEHAN NOTED THAT THE USG WAS INVESTIGATING WHETHER </p><p>PARAMILITARIES COULD BE DESIGNATED AS A FOREIGN TERRORIST </p><p>ORGANIZATION.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LEGISLATION NOT STRONG ENOUGH; "JAILS ARE A JOKE" </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  SHEEHAN AND SHERIDAN LISTENED TO A LITANY OF </p><p>COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE COLOMBIAN JUDICIAL SYSTEM, INCLUDING </p><p>MINISTER RAMIREZ\'S ARGUMENT FOR TOUGHER LEGISLATION AND </p><p>PENAL CODES THAT WOULD ALLOW THE GOVERNMENT TO TAKE A </p><p>STRONGER STAND AGAINST TERRORISTS AND GUERRILLAS. </p><p>SENTENCES ARE LIGHT AND TOO OFTEN COMMUTED.  TAPIAS </p><p>CONFIRMED THIS POINT, STRESSING THAT THE JAIL SYSTEM WAS "A </p><p>JOKE" WHICH DID NOT DETER CRIMINALS.  HE NOTED THAT THE </p><p>INDIVIDUAL DETAINED AS A SUSPECT ON THE CALI CHURCH </p><p>KIDNAPPING HAS ALREADY FLED PRISON. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CRIME-TERRORISM LINK </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  RAMIREZ AND TAPIAS ALSO NOTED THE INCREASINGLY </p><p>POWERFUL ARMS AVAILABLE TO THE TERRORISTS ON THE BLACK </p><p>MARKET, WHILE OTHERS NOTED THE OUTSOURCING OF CRIMINAL </p><p>ACTIVITY BY THE FARC AND THE ELN.  THEY ALSO NOTED THAT THE </p><p>FARC IS BEGINNING TO ENCROACH ON URBAN AREAS.  SHEEHAN </p><p>STRESSED THAT THE COLOMBIANS HAD TO TAKE A VERY STRONG </p><p>STAND AND MAKE CLEAR THAT THEY WILL DEAL WITH TERRORISM AND </p><p>VIOLENCE AS A CRIME, NOT A POLITICAL ISSUE.  ALL INVOLVED </p><p>WITH TERRORISM - REGARDLESS OF WHETHER INVOLVED IN </p><p>FUNDRAISING, HARBORING TERRORISTS, OR CARRYING OUT </p><p>TERRORIST ACTS - HAD TO BE PUNISHED. GEN JORGE MORA, </p><p>COMMANDER OF THE COLOMBIAN ARMY, NOTED THAT THEY FELT </p><p>CAUGHT BETWEEN THEIR DESIRE TO WORK FOR TOUGHER LAWS AND </p><p>LAW ENFORCEMENT AND EUROPEAN AND OTHER PRESSURE NOT TO DO </p><p>ANYTHING THAT WOULD MAKE THE GOC APPEAR TO BE VIOLATING </p><p>INTERNATIONALLY ACCEPTED HUMAN RIGHTS.  HE ALSO STRESSED </p><p>THAT THE TERRORIST AND REBEL GROUPS MUST RECEIVE THE </p><p>MESSAGE FROM THE UNITED STATES THAT THEIR ACTIONS WILL BE </p><p>SEEN AS TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  SHEEHAN CONFIRMED THE UNITED STATES\' CONCERN ABOUT </p><p>TERRORISM IN COLOMBIA, NOTING THAT HE WOULD URGE OTHER </p><p>PARTS OF THE GOVERNMENT TO PUBLICLY EXPRESS THEIR </p><p>OPPOSITION TO TERRORIST GROUPS.  ALTHOUGH "PLAN COLOMBIA" </p><p>WAS NOT THE MAIN TOPIC OF CONVERSATION, IT AND THE USG\'S </p><p>PENDING FINANCIAL RESPONSE WAS IMPLICIT IN THE EXCHANGE. </p><p>THE COLOMBIANS OPENLY STATED THE NEED FOR INCREASED </p><p>RESOURCES AND TRAINING. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  COMMENT:  THE GOC OFFICIALS AT THE MEETING SEEMED </p><p>TO GO OUT OF THEIR WAY NOT TO BLAME PRESIDENT PASTRANA OR </p><p>EVEN TO MENTION HIS NAME. THIS OMISSION IS AT ODDS WITH </p><p>LOCAL MEDIA AND EVEN STREET GRAFFITI IN WHICH PASTRANA\'S </p><p>"PEACE AT ANY COST" STANCE IS EQUATED WITH WEAKNESS AND AN </p><p>UNWILLINGNESS TO CONFRONT THE THREAT REPRESENTED BY THE </p><p>FARC, THE ELN, THE PARAMILITARIES, AND OTHER TERRORIST </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS.  DESPITE STATING THEIR LACK OF RESOURCES, </p><p>THE MILITARY LEADERS GAVE NO INDICATION THAT THEY WERE </p><p>LOBBYING FOR AN INCREASE IN MILITARY SPENDING, CURRENTLY </p><p>ABOUT THREE AND A HALF PERCENT OF GDP.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>KAMMAN </p><p></p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
