<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 003507 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/29/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PTER, PHUM, PGOV, SCUL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKISH FONMIN GUL TO OIC: "WE SHOULD FIRST PUT </p><p>OUR (ISLAMIC) HOUSE IN ORDER." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 140027 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Political Counselor John Kunstadter. </p><p>Reason: 1.5(b)(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Much of May 29 Turkish press highlights what it </p><p>reports as Deputy P.M./FonMin Gul\'s strong pro-democracy </p><p>statement at May 28 OIC meeting in Tehran.  Promoting what </p><p>some press characterized as a "visionary" message (one </p><p>supporting some USG points in reftel demarche), Gul urged the </p><p>transformation of the Muslim world by "put(ting) our house in </p><p>good order": </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- telling Muslim countries to reform their administrations </p><p>to meet the needs of the modern age through "a vision in </p><p>which good governance, transparency and accountability will </p><p>reign (over) fundamental rights and freedom and gender </p><p>equality are upheld..." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- calling for reforms to promote democracy, political </p><p>participation, equal opportunity; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- insisting that "rational thinking should be our driving </p><p>force"; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- advocating the eradication of illiteracy, corruption and </p><p>waste of human, natural and material resources; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- urging that the OIC\'s message should be "unity in </p><p>diversity." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) We will follow up with members of Gul\'s delegation and </p><p>with MFA contacts for first-hand readouts of what Gul said in </p><p>his private contacts with the Syrians and Iranians when the </p><p>del returns to Ankara week of June 2.  But it is clear that </p><p>Gul\'s comments are significant in several respects, </p><p>particularly in terms of the domestic political and policy </p><p>battles shaping up in Ankara.  First, the philosophical: </p><p>Gul\'s emphasis on "rational thinking," though coming from a </p><p>political leader with impeccable "Islamic" credentials, runs </p><p>counter to a theme recently reiterated in the Turkish </p><p>Islamist press.  Abdurrahman Dilipak, a columnist and Embassy </p><p>contact with great influence over the Islamist hardcore </p><p>rank-and-file, took issue recently with the West\'s allegedly </p><p>"rationalist secular religion," which he charged has no </p><p>respect for "sacred values." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Equally important, the new activist approach </p><p>articulated by Gul under the influence of Ahmet Davutoglu </p><p>(now foreign policy adviser to P.M. Erdogan) is essentially </p><p>radical in its vision.  As such, it is likely to cause </p><p>friction in a Turkish foreign policy Establishment habituated </p><p>to caution and willingness to look the other way in the face </p><p>of the very failings of the Islamic world\'s political </p><p>leadership that most need to be addressed, particularly in </p><p>the wake of September 11. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
