(U) Revised Sensitive But Unclassified Post submission of the </p><p>2003 Special 301 Review for Honduras follows.  Addressees are </p><p>requested to replace reftel with this submission. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Summary and Comment: Honduras is largely in compliance </p><p>with the Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights </p><p>(TRIPS).  There have been no additional moves in the past year by </p><p>Government of Honduras (GOH) to strengthen or weaken the </p><p>protection of Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) in 2002. </p><p>Embassy recommends that Honduras remain off the Special 301 watch </p><p>list. </p><p> </p><p>OPTICAL MEDIA PIRACY </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Although Honduras has yet to experience large-scale in- </p><p>country optical pirating, it is believed that a significant </p><p>amount of pirated goods is imported from neighboring countries </p><p>and that the piracy of books, sound and video recordings, compact </p><p>discs and computer software is still widespread.  Confiscation </p><p>has been erratic and usually involves minor seizures of CDs. </p><p>Success in controlling optical piracy rests on the GOH\'s ability </p><p>to effectively implement current laws. </p><p> </p><p>USE/PROCUREMENT OF GOVERNMENT SOFTWARE </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) The GOH has made progress in its protection of the use and </p><p>procurement of government software.  After a meeting in 2002 </p><p>between the new government and Econoff during which he reminded </p><p>them of their responsibilities, Honduras\' IPR Division sent </p><p>letters to all government agencies informing them that all </p><p>government software use must comply with Honduran national law </p><p>and international agreements.  Due to a lack of resources and </p><p>personnel at the IPR division, oversight and enforcement has been </p><p>limited. </p><p> </p><p>TRIPS COMPLIANCE </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) Honduras largely has complied with the WTO Agreement on </p><p>Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), </p><p>through legal revisions enacted in December 1999.  The Honduran </p><p>Congress still must, for instance, adopt reforms related to </p><p>integrated circuit designs and plant variety protection to be in </p><p>full compliance with TRIPS. Honduras and the U.S. initialed a </p><p>Bilateral Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) Agreement in March </p><p>1999, but substantive issues arose during the language conformity </p><p>process.  Embassy expects that the current U.S.-Central America </p><p>free trade negotiations will provide a convenient forum for the </p><p>USG to push for additional IPR commitments. </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) Honduras\' copyright law, updated in 1999, added more than </p><p>20 different criminal offenses related to copyright infringement </p><p>and established fines and suspension of services that can be </p><p>levied against offenders.  U.S. companies are concerned that </p><p>recent attempts to prosecute computer software infringement cases </p><p>have been met with inadequate support by officials in the </p><p>Ministry of Industry and Trade\'s IPR Division and the Attorney </p><p>General\'s office. </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) Honduras ratified the Paris Convention for the Protection </p><p>of Industrial Property in 1994.  The Honduran Congress enacted a </p><p>1999 Law of Industrial Property to provide improved protection </p><p>for both trademarks and patents.  To be protected under Honduran </p><p>law, patents and trademarks must be registered with the Ministry </p><p>of Industry and Trade. </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) Recent modifications to the Patent Law of 1993 include </p><p>patent protection for pharmaceuticals, and extend the term of </p><p>protection for a patent from seventeen to twenty years from the </p><p>date of filing to meet WTO standards.  The term for cancellation </p><p>of a trademark for lack of use has been extended from one year to </p><p>three years.  Trademarks are valid for up to 10 years from the </p><p>registration date.  The illegitimate registration of well-known </p><p>trademarks has, in the past, been a persistent problem in </p><p>Honduras. </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) The protection of data exclusivity by the GOH has been </p><p>raised by the pharmaceutical and pesticide companies.  A U.S. </p><p>pharmaceutical company has complained that the Ministry of </p><p>Health, in approving a competing company\'s pharmaceutical </p><p>product, did not respect their data exclusivity rights as </p><p>guaranteed in article 77 of Honduras\' Industrial Property Law and </p><p>article 39 of the WTO TRIP\'s agreement.  The Ministry of Health </p><p>approved the competing pharmaceutical product, despite </p><p>communication from Honduras\' IPR Division that the U.S. company\'s </p><p>research and data were protected under Honduran law.  The U.S. </p><p>company argues that in order for the competing product to be </p><p>legally registered with the Ministry of Health, the company needs </p><p>to provide the research and data to support their application. </p><p>Honduran law provides five-year exclusive use of data provided in </p><p>support of registering pharmaceutical products.  Further, a </p><p>regional association of pesticide companies met with Econoffs on </p><p>a number of occasions to express concern over the GOH\'s 5-year </p><p>data exclusivity period which from their perspective is </p><p>insufficient to justify product development and testing in </p><p>Honduras. </p><p> </p><p>WORLD INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS ORGANIZATION </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) Honduras became a member of the World Intellectual </p><p>Property Organization (WIPO) in 1983.  Honduras has not yet </p><p>ratified the WIPO Copyright Treaty (WCT) or the WIPO Performances </p><p>and Phonogram Treaty (WPPT).  The treaties were signed two years </p><p>ago and are still awaiting ratification in the National Congress. </p><p> </p><p>IPR ENFORCEMENT </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>11. (U) The 1999 Copyright Law specifies three different avenues </p><p>in the prosecution of copyright infringement cases: </p><p>administrative, civil and criminal.  After confiscating pirated </p><p>goods, the GOH can file an administrative case that may result in </p><p>a fine.  However, the law requires companies whose rights have </p><p>been violated to file civil and criminal charges.  Few U.S. </p><p>companies have asserted their right to file either a civil or </p><p>criminal case, leaving the resource strapped prosecutor\'s office </p><p>responsible for the lawsuits.  As a result, few cases are tried </p><p>to the full extent of the law. </p><p> </p><p>12. (U) Enforcement of the law relies largely on periodic sweeps </p><p>in the market and on investigations carried out after an </p><p>accusation has been made.  The GOH Customs and Tax Authority </p><p>(DEI) is responsible for impeding the flow of illegal goods into </p><p>Honduras.  IPR officials have commented in the past that police </p><p>and DEI officials lack the skills and resources to identify and </p><p>control the flow of pirated products. </p><p> </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
