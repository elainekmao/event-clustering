<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 05 KADUNA 00365 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR MCKINLEY; PARIS FOR PERL0W </p><p>LAGOS PASS TO ABUJA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS: KPRP, PINR, PGOV, ECON, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: THE LAST GASP FROM KADUNA: WHO\'S WHO </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL -- ENTIRE TEXT </p><p> </p><p>2.  THE FOLLOWING CABLE PROVIDES BIOGRAPHIC DATA </p><p>REFLECTING THE CONSUL GENERAL\'S CONTACTS THROUGHOUT THE </p><p>NORTH OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS.  THE SKETCHES DO NOT </p><p>AIM TO REPRODUCE MATERIAL MOST LIKELY ALREADY AVAILABLE </p><p>IN AF AND INR FILES, BUT RATHER TO GIVE IMPRESSIONS AND </p><p>ASSESSMENTS OF CHARACTER AND OPINION.  IT IS COMPLETED </p><p>A HALF HOUR BEFORE CG\'S DEPARTURE FOR RETIREMENT AND, </p><p>THEREFORE, SUFFERED FROM LACK OF EDITING AND </p><p>COMPLETENESS.  PLEASE FORGIVE| </p><p> </p><p>HRADITIONALSRULERS </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3.  IBRAHIM DASUKI, SULTAN OF SOKOTO.  MUCH HAS BEEN </p><p>WRITTEN ABOUT THE SULTAN, BUT IT IS PERHAPS WORTH </p><p>REITERATING THAT HIS POPULARITY  AS NOT RISEN IN THE </p><p>FIVE YEARS SINCE HE HAS OCCUPIED THE THRONE.  HIS </p><p>LAVISH PALACE RENOVATIONS ARE VIEWED BY MANY AS TOTALLY </p><p>AT ODDS WITH ISLAMIC INJUNCTION.  HE IS A SMART, </p><p>SOPHISTICATED MAN, BUT IT IS DIFFICULT TO DISCERN THE </p><p>DEGREE OF VENALITY HE HAS CARRIED OVER FROM HIS BCCI </p><p>DAYS AND HIS ASSOCIATION WITH GENERAL BABANGIDA, TO </p><p>WHOM HE OWES HIS ELECTION TO THE THRONE.  SEVERAL OF </p><p>THE SULTAN\'S SONS HAVE STUDIED IN THE UNITED STATES AND </p><p>AT LEAST A COUPLE OF HAVE SECOND HOMES IN NORTHERN </p><p>VIRGINIA. </p><p> </p><p>4.  ALHAJI SHEHU IDRIS, EMIR OF ZARIA.  THE EMIR OF </p><p>ZARIA, OR SARKIN ZAZZAU TO GIVE HIM HIS HAUSA TITLE, IS </p><p>A FREQUENT INTERLOCUTOR OF EMBASSY AND CONSULATE </p><p>PERSONNEL.  HE LOOKS FOR EXCHANGES WITH FOREIGN </p><p>DIPLOMATS ON BOTH POLITICAL QUESTIONS AND HIS EFFORTS </p><p>TO PROMOTE INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE IN KADUNA STATE.  HE </p><p>IS DEEPLY DISTRUSTED BY THE CHRISTIAN COMMUNITIES IN </p><p>SOUTHERN KADUNA STATE, WHO SEE HIM AS A MAJOR </p><p>IMPEDIMENT TO THEIR ENJOYING FULL POLITICAL AND </p><p>PROPERTY RIGHTS IN THE STATE.  NEVERTHELESS, WE HAVE </p><p>ALWAYS ENJOYED EASY ACCESS TO THE EMIR WHO IS FRIENDLY </p><p>AND AS OPEN AS THESE RULERS CAN BE. </p><p> </p><p>5.  ALHAJI ADO BAYERO, EMIR OF KANO.  THE EMIR OF KANO </p><p>IS SOMEWHAT MORE FORMAL WITH US AND IT CAN BE MORE </p><p>DIFFICULT TO GET AN APPOINTMENT WITH HIM, BUT HE, LIKE </p><p>HIS FELLOW EMIRS, IS ALWAYS FRIENDLY AND INTERESTING TO </p><p>TALK TO.  HE TRAVELS FREQUENTLY TO THE UNITED STATES, </p><p>BOTH ON PRIVATE TRIPS AND, OCCASIONALLY, TO VISIT </p><p>VARIOUS NIGERIAN COMMUNITIES AND CULTURAL EVENTS.  HE </p><p>WAS A DIPLOMAT PRIOR TO TAKING THE TITLE THIRTY YEARS </p><p>AGO AND IS, THEREFORE, EASY WITH OTHER DIPL0MATS.  HE </p><p>IS REGARDED BY NORTHERN NIGERIANS TO BE MUCH STUFFIER </p><p>THAN THE EMIRS OF ZARIA OR KATSINA; ONE INTERLOCUTOR </p><p>CLOSE TO THE KATSINA EMIRATE WAS VISIBLY SURPRISED TO </p><p>LEARN THAT THE KANO EMIR ROUTINELY SHOOK THE HAND OF </p><p>THE (FEMALE) CONSUL GENERAL, SOMETHING THAT, </p><p>TRADITIONALLY, HE SHOULD NOT DO.  (ALL OTHER EMIRS BUT </p><p>THE SULTAN OF SOKOTO HAVE EXTENDED THEIR HAND TO THE </p><p>CONSUL GENERAL.) </p><p> </p><p>PRESS </p><p>------ </p><p> </p><p>6.  MALAM MOHAMMED HARUNA, MANAGING DIRECTOR, CITIZEN </p><p>PUBLICATIONS.  HARUNA IS A VERY BRIGHT YOUNG JOURNALIST </p><p>WHO IS AT THE HEAD OF ONE OF THE MORE INTERESTING </p><p>WEEKLY MAGAZINES IN NIGERIA.  THE CITIZEN WAS FOUNDED, </p><p>UNDER THE CHAIRMANSHIP OF ALHAJI TURI MUHAMMADU, BY A </p><p>GROUP OF REBELS FROM THE NEW NIGERIAN WHO WERE UNHAPPY </p><p>AT THAT PAPER\'S LOSS OF EDITORIAL INDEPENDENCE. </p><p>ALTHOUGH HARUNA (AND HIS MAGAZINE) TAKE STRONG </p><p>PRO-ISLAMIC STANDS, THE MAGAZINE IS WELL WRITTEN AND </p><p>ARGUED, A HAPPY EXCEPTION IN JOURNALISM IN NIGERIA. </p><p>PERSONALLY, HARUNA IS FRIENDLY TO AMERICAN DIPLOMATS, </p><p>HAPPY TO SPEAK WITH US AND ANY VISITORS WE MAY HAVE, </p><p>AND WILL UNFAILINGLY RESPECT ANY REQUEST THAT </p><p>DISCUSSIONS BE OFF THE RECORD.  THIS PERMITS US TO HAVE </p><p>SIGNIFICANT BACKGROUND DISCUSSIONS WITH HIM AND HIS </p><p>EDITOR, BILKISU YUSUF (SEE BELOW). </p><p> </p><p>7.  HAJIYA BILKISU YUSUF, EDITOR OF THE CITIZEN </p><p>MAGAZINE.  YUSUF IS NOT ONLY A LEADING JOURNALIST IN </p><p>NORTHERN NIGERIA, BUT SHE IS ALSO A SIGNIFICANT WOMEN\'S </p><p>ACTIVIST AND MEMBER OF "FOMWON" -- FEDERATION OF MUSLIM </p><p>WOMEN OF NIGERIA.  SHE IS EXTREMELY WELL EDUCATED IN </p><p>ISLAM AND IS OBSERVANT IN WAYS THAT LEAD US TO BELIEVE </p><p>SHE MAY BE A MEMBER OF THE DARIKA SECT.  SHE FASTS </p><p>EVERY MONDAY AND THURSDAY, AND WILL ABSOLUTELY NOT </p><p>SHAKE HANDS WITH MEN.  SHE HAS STRONG TIES TO ISLAMIC </p><p>SCHOLARS IN SUDAN AND TRAVELS THERE FREQUENTLY.  WE </p><p>HAVE FOUND HER TO BE FRIENDLY AND OPEN IN DISCUSSIONS. </p><p>CURRENTLY, SHE IS A MEMBER OF THE NIPSS STUDY CLASS, </p><p>AND IS RESIDENT IN JOS FOR TH YIPERIOD. </p><p> </p><p>8.  GARDA SHEHU, MANAGING DIRECTOR, TRIUMPH </p><p>NEWSPAPERS.  GARBA SHEHU PRESIDES OVER A STATE-OWNED </p><p>PRESS OPERATION THAT IS PERPETUALLY STARVED OF FUNDS </p><p>AND SUBJECT TO THE VAGARIES OF GOVERNMENT CONTROLLED </p><p>PRESS.  THIS SAID, HE IS A BRIGHT MAN, ALWAYS READY TO </p><p>SEE AMERICAN DIPLOMATS, AND, LIKE HARUNA AT THE </p><p>CITIZEN, IS PUNCTILIOUS ABOUT HONORING "BACKGROUND" </p><p>RULES.  WE HAVE HAD LONG AND FULL CONVERSATIONS WITH </p><p>GARBA SHEHU AND HIS EDITORIAL BOARD; THEY ASK TOUGH BUT </p><p>FAIR QUESTIONS.  GARBA SHEHU IS WIDELY RESPECTED BY </p><p>MANY OF THE NORTHERN ELDERS, PARTLY BECAUSE HE IS THE </p><p>TREASURER FOR THE BAREWA OLD BOYS ASSOCIATION (THE </p><p>SECONDARY SCHOOL A LARGE NUMBER OF THE NORTHERM ELITES </p><p>HAVE ATTENDED) AND WORKS HARD FOR THE ALMA MATER. </p><p> </p><p>9.  ALHAJI TURI MUHAMMADU, NOW RETIRED BUT CHAIRMAN OF </p><p>THE CITIZEN AND A FORMER EDITOR OF NEW NIGERIAN </p><p>NEWSPAPERS.  ALSO A FORMER NORTHERN MANAGER, UTC.  TURI </p><p>MUHAMMADU, WHO COMES FROM NIGER STATE, IS A THOUGHTFUL </p><p>AND VERY INTERESTING INTERLOCUTOR, A RARE NIGERIAN WHO </p><p>READS VORACIOUSLY AND INTELLIGENTLY.  (IN THE PAST </p><p>YEAR, WE HAVE PASSED HIM COPIES OF THE GEORGE SCHULZ </p><p>AUTOBIOGRAPHY WHICH HE DEVOURED IN A COUPLE OF DAYS AND </p><p>FOLLOWED IT UP WITH THE MCCULLOGH BIOGRAPHY OF </p><p>TRUMAN.)  HE IS SHY AND GENERALLY DOES NOT COME TO </p><p>VONSULATE PARTIES, BUT IS WILLING TO HAVE ONE-ON-ONE </p><p>MEETINGS AND IS AN INFORMED AND SERIOUS CONTACT. </p><p> </p><p>10.  ALHAJI ISMAILA ISA, MANAGING DIRECTOR, DEMOCRAT </p><p>NEWSPAPER, AND CHAIRMAN OF BULET, A CONSTRUCTION FIRM. </p><p>ISMAILA ISA WAS RAISED IN THE HOME OF HIS UNCLE, </p><p>NORTHERN ELDER ISA KAITA, AND COMES FROM FUNTUA IN </p><p>KATSINA STATE.  HE IS ALSO THE LANDLORD OF THE </p><p>CONSULATE OFFICE BUILDING.  IN OUR CONTACTS WITH HIM, </p><p>WE HAVE FOUND HIM TO BE A MAN OF SHALLOW OPINION AND </p><p>CONSIDERABLE PREJUDICE AGAINST AMERICANS.  HE CAN BE </p><p>VERY KIND ON THOSE OCCASIONS WHEN WE HAVE BEEN IN A FIX </p><p>(SAY, WITH TWO FLAT TIRES ON THE ABUJA ROAD), SO IT </p><p>GOES AGAINST THE GRAIN TO CRITICIZE, BUT HIS NEWSPAPER </p><p>TAKES OFTEN IRRESPONSIBLE POSITIONS AND HE CLAIMS NO </p><p>CONTROL OVER IT.  HA| </p><p> </p><p>BUSINESS </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  ALHAJI AMINU DANTATA.  AMINU DANTATA IS THE </p><p>PATRIARCH OF THE DANTATA ORGANIZATION, A FAMILY FIRM </p><p>INVOLVED IN TRADING AND AGRIBUSINESS ENTERPRISES. </p><p>AMINU DANTATA IS A DEVOUT MOSLEM, A PHILANTHROPIST TO </p><p>ISLAMIC AND OTHER CHARITIES ON A AWESOME SCALE, AND </p><p>PART OF AN ENORMOUS FAMILY.  HIMSELF ONE OF SEVERAL </p><p>BROTHERS/COUSINS, HE HAS FOUR WIVES AND TWENTY-SEVEN </p><p>CHILDREN.  IN OUR PRIVATE CONTACTS, HE HAS BEEN OPEN </p><p>ABOUT HIS DOUBTS ABOUT THE UTILITY OF DEMOCRACY FOR </p><p>NIGERIA, BELIEVING IT IS A NON-INDIGENOUS SYSTEM BEING </p><p>IMPOSED BY THE WEST FOR PROBABLY GOOD, BUT MISPLACED, </p><p>INTENTIONS.  HE IS RELATIVELY UNFORTHCOMING ABOUT HIS </p><p>OWN BUSINESS OR GENERAL BUSINESS CONDITIONS IN KANO, </p><p>HIS HOME BASE.  NEVERTHELESS, HE IS ALWAYS READY TO SEE </p><p>CONSULATE AND EMBASSY VISITORS AND IS RELAXED AND </p><p>FRIENDLY.  HE MAINTAINS A HOME IN SAUDI ARABIA WHERE HE </p><p>SPENDS A GOOD DEAL OF TIME EACH YEAR DURING THE HAJJ </p><p>AND UMMRA.  HIS CHILDREN HAVE MOSTLY GONE TO SCHOOL IN </p><p>SAUDI ARABIA AND THEN ON TO UNIVERSITY IN MIAMI </p><p>(FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY) FOR THE BOYS AND </p><p>BAYERO UNIVERSITY KANO (FOR THE GIRLS).  AMINU DANTATA </p><p>ALSO HAS HOUSES IN FLORIDA AND GENERALLY A TROUP OF THE </p><p>FAMILY GOES ON SUMMER HOLIDAY IN THE U.S.  (DANTATA DAY </p><p>IN THE VISA SECTION IS A BUSY TIME.) </p><p> </p><p>12.  ALHAJI TAJUDEEN DANTATA, THE SON OF AMINU DANTATA </p><p>WHO IS MANAGING DIRECTOR OF THE ORGANIZATION AND IS </p><p>BEING GROOMED TO TAKE OVER THE OPERATION.  TAJUDEEN </p><p>DANTATA IS YOUNG (PROBABLY AROUND 30), AND LOOKS </p><p>YOUNGER, BUT IS THE CHOSEN SUCCESSOR TO TAKE OVER THE </p><p>FAMILY FIRM.  APPARENTLY HIS OLDER BROTHER WAS MEANT TO </p><p>BE THE HEIR BUT WAS KILLED IN A POLO ACCIDENT, SO </p><p>TAJUDEEN HAS ONLY RECENTLY ASSUMED THE MANTLE.  HE IS </p><p>OPEN TO CONTACT WITH AMERICAN DIPLOMATS AND, LIKE MOST </p><p>NORTHERN BUSINESSMEN, KEEPS HIS FAMILY IN KANO WHILE HE </p><p>LIVES PART-TIME IN LAGOS AND TRAVELS THE WORLD. </p><p> </p><p>13.  MUNZALI DANTATA, A COUSIN OF THE TWO ABOVE, IS THE </p><p>PROPRIETOR OF ALL STATES TRAVEL, A FIRM WITH THE AGENCY </p><p>FOR SAUDIA AIRLINES IN LAGOS.  HE IS SOMEWHAT </p><p>INDEPENDENT OF THE BUSINESS INTERESTS OF THE MAIN </p><p>BRANCH OF THE FAMILY AND PRIDES HIMSELF ON BUILDING UP </p><p>HIS TRAVEL AGENCY.  HE ADMIRES THE U.S. AND WOULD LIKE </p><p>TO DEVELOP A TOURIST LINK WITH AMERICA, BUT MAY BE </p><p>SOMEWHAT UNREALISTIC ABOUT HOW MUCH WORK WILL HAVE TO </p><p>BE DONE TO PRODUCE AN ATTRACTIVE TOURIST INFRASTRUCTURE </p><p>FOR AMERICANS.  HE IS THE AUTHOR OF A RECENTLY </p><p>PUBLISHED GUIDEBOOK ON ABUJA AND RUNS BUS TOURSZOF THE </p><p>NEW CAPITAL AS PART OF HIS ENDEAVORS.  HE IS AN </p><p>ENTHUSIASTIC AND ENTERPRISING GUY. </p><p> </p><p>14.  WAZIRI MOHAMMED, A SON-IN-LAW OF AMINU DANTATA, IS </p><p>A DIRECTOR OF PACIFIC MERCHANT BANK IN LAGOS.  HE IS </p><p>KANURI AND COMES FROM MAIDUGURI WHERE HIS FAMILY </p><p>LIVES.  LAGOS HAS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED ON WAZIRI </p><p>MOHAMMED AND HIS POLITICAL ACTIVITIES IN THE KINGIBE </p><p>CAMPAIGN.  WE UNDERSTAND FROM A PREVIOUS POLITICAL </p><p>COUNSELOR IN LAGOS THAT WAZIRI MOHAMMED HAS CLOSE LINKS </p><p>WITH MILITARY INTELLIGENCE.  HE IS A FOREIGN SERVICE </p><p>BRAT, AND THUS QUITE SOPHISTICATED AND WELL-TRAVELED. </p><p>HE HAS BEEN VERY FRIENDLY BOTH WITH CONSULATE KADUNA </p><p>AND EMBASSY LAGOS PERSONNEL. </p><p> </p><p>15.  ALIKO DANGOTE, RELATED THROUGH HIS MOTHER TO THE </p><p>DANTATA CLAM (HER FATHER WAS A BROTHER TO AMINU </p><p>DANTATA\'S FATHER), IS THE CHAIRMAN (AT AGE 35) OF THE </p><p>DANGOTE GROUP OF COMPANIES.  THE DANGOTE FATHER DIED </p><p>EARLY AND THE FAMILY COMPANY IS NOW CONDUCTED BY A </p><p>GROUP OF BROTHERS, THE PRINCIPAL ONES OF WHOM ARE SANI </p><p>AND BELLO (SEE BELOW).  ALIKO, LIKE AMINU DANTATA, IS A </p><p>MAJOR FIGURE AT MANY CHARITABLE FUNDRAISING EVENTS.  HE </p><p>HAS JUST MARRIED FOR THE THIRD TIME -- LIKE AMERICANS, </p><p>HIS MARRIAGES HAVE BEEN SERIAL RATHER THAN POLYGAMOUS. </p><p>THE DANGOTES HAVE HOMES IN KANO, LAGOS, LONDON, AND </p><p>ATLANTA AND, LIKE THE DANTATAS, TAKE A LARGE GROUP OF </p><p>FAMILY MEMBERS FOR AN AMERICAN HOLIDAY EVERY SUMMER. </p><p> </p><p>16.  SANI DANGOTE, BROTHER TO ALIKO, IS THE BROTHER WHO </p><p>WATCHES OVER THE FAMILY TEXTILE, OILFIELD SERVICES, AND </p><p>COMMODITY (COCOA, SUGAR) TRADING OPERATIONS.  HE HAS </p><p>JUST CONCLUDED A LICENSING AGREEMENT TO PRODUCE </p><p>NUTRASWEET IN NIGERIA, TO REDUCE COSTS OF SWEETENERS </p><p>THE FIRM PROVIDES TO SOFT DRINK MANUFACTURERS.  SANI </p><p>DANGOTE IS A PASSIONATE POLO PLAYER.  HE IS NOT </p><p>PARTICULARLY WELL EDUCATED, HAVING ATTENDED A </p><p>COMMERCIAL COLLEGE IN KANO.  HE ADMIRES AMERICANS AND </p><p>SEEKS TO DO BUSINESS IN AMERICA.  HE IS AN OPEN, </p><p>FRIENDLY, AND ENTERTAINING INTERLOCUTOR.  SANI DANGOTE </p><p>IS MARRIED WITH FOUR CHILDREN, ONE OF THEM BORN IN THE </p><p>U.S. </p><p> </p><p>17.  BELLO DANGOTE IS THE BROTHER CHARGED WITH </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE FAMILY BANK, LIBERTY MERCHAMT. </p><p>HE WAS EDUCATED IN ITALY AS AN ENGINEER.  HE IS </p><p>MARRIED, TO A SISTER OF SANI DANGOTE\'S WIFE, AND HAS </p><p>THREE CHILDREN, TWO OF THEM BORN IN THE U.S.  LIKE HIS </p><p>BROTHERS, HE IS FRIENDLY TO AMERICANS. </p><p> </p><p>18.  ALHAJI BASHIR BORODO IS A BUSINESSMAN ON A MORE </p><p>MODEST SCALE THAN THE CLANS DESCRIBED ABOVE.  HE IS THE </p><p>MANAGING DIRECTOR OF ONE OF THE DANTATA COMPANIES (A </p><p>FERTILIZER MIXING PLANT IN KANO STATE) AND THE FORMER </p><p>CHAIRMAN OF THE FORMERLY STATE-OWNED BANK, TROPICAL </p><p>COMMERCIAL BANK, THAT HAS NOW PRIVATIZED.  HE ALSO HAS </p><p>HIS OWN BUSINESS, BORODO AND CO., THAT PRODUCES ICE </p><p>BLOCKS, EXPORTS MOTORBIKES, AND ENGAGES IN OTHER MIXES </p><p>OF TRADING.  HE WAS TRAINED (IN CAIRO) AS AN ECONOMIST </p><p>AND JOINED THE NIGERIAN FOREIGN SERVICE.  ONE OF HIS </p><p>POSTINGS WAS AT THE EMBASSY IN WASHINGTON (FROM ABOUT </p><p>1978 TO 198O) WHERE THE DESK OFFICERS FOUND HIM THE </p><p>STRONGEST DIPLOMAT AT THE EMBASSY.  HE IS FAR AND AWAY </p><p>THE MOST INTELLIGENT CONTACT WE HAVE FOUND ON THE </p><p>ECONOMIC SCENE IN THE NORTH. </p><p> </p><p>19.  MALAM DAHIRU MUHAMMAD, MANAGING DIRECTOR AND CEO </p><p>OF FIRST AFRICA MERCHANT BANK, HEADQUARTERED IN </p><p>KADUNA.  ACTUALLY WE TAKE THAT BACK ABOUT BORODO BEING </p><p>THE "MOST INTELLIGENT," SINCE DAHIRU MUHAMMAD IS IN THE </p><p>SAME CLASS.  EDUCATED AT VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY, DAHIRU </p><p>MUHAMMAD IS AN EXCEPTIONALLY WELL-INFORMED AND </p><p>OUTSPOKEN INFORMANT ON THE ECONOMIC SCENE.  LONG BEFORE </p><p>IT BECAME THE FASHION, HE POINTED TO THE BUDGETARY AND </p><p>MONETARY POLICIES OF THE BABANGIDA REGIME THAT </p><p>BANKRUPTED THE NATION AND RIDICULED THE CALLS FOR </p><p>ARTIFICIAL PEGGING OF THE NAIRA.  HE IS VERY OPEN TO </p><p>AMERICANS AND WILLING TO MEET WITH US, OFFICIALLY OR </p><p>SOCIALLY. </p><p> </p><p>20.  ISAIAH BALAT, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE KADUNA </p><p>CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND CHAIRMAN OF SEVERAL COMPANIES </p><p>BASED IN KADUNA (FINANCE, OIL SERVICES, ETC.).  BALAT </p><p>IS, TO US, MORE INTERESTING AS AN INTERLOCUTOR ON </p><p>POLITICAL AND ETHNIC QUESTIONS THAN ON COMMERCIAL </p><p>DEVELOPMENTS.  HE WAS ACTIVE IN THE SDP AND STRONGLY </p><p>FOUGHT FOR ABIOLA AND JUNE 12 OVER THE SUMMER OF 1993, </p><p>SEEING THE ISSUE ALMOST COMPLETELY THROUGH HIS SOUTHERN </p><p>KADUNA-CHRISTIAN EYES.  HE IS VERY WELL CONNECTED IN </p><p>KADUNA, FRIENDLY TO AMERICANS, AND HAPPY TO SHARE HIS </p><p>THOUGHTS WITH US.  WE FOUND CONVERSATIONS WITH HIM </p><p>PARTICULARLY USEFUL IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE ZANGON </p><p>KATAF RIOTS, SINCE HE COMES FROM THAT AREA, AND, SINCE </p><p>THEN, HAS WORKED ON A NUMBER OS COMMITTEES TO TRY TO </p><p>GET AT THE CAUSES OF INTERCOMMUNAL TENSION IN THE STATE. </p><p> </p><p>21.  ALHAJI AUWALU ILU, PRESIDENT OF THE KANO CHAMBER </p><p>OF COMMERCE, AND BUSINESSMAN WITH INTERESTS IN CLOTH </p><p>TRADING AND LPG SUPPLY.  AUWALU ILU IS AN ENGAGING </p><p>INTERLOCUTOR WITH HIS FINGER ON THE PULSE OF THAT PART </p><p>OF THE KANO ECONOMY THAT HIS CHAMBER MOST REPRESENTS -- </p><p>THE ESTABLISHED, MID-RANKING TRADER.  HE IS ALWAYS GOOD </p><p>FOR AN INTIMATE POLITICAL GOSSIP, BUT, OVER THE YEARS, </p><p>WE HAVE FOUND THAT HE SWINGS AROUND A BIT WITH THE </p><p>PREVAILING BREEZE.  NEVERTHELESS, HE KNOWS EVERYBODY </p><p>AND IS ALWAYS WELCOMING TO US WHEN WE DROP IN.  HE HAS </p><p>BEEN VERY HELPFUL DURING AMBASSADORIAL VISITS TO KANO, </p><p>PARTICULARLY AS HE CAN PUT TOGETHER A GROUP FOR DINNER </p><p>THAT IS ALWAYS WORTH MEETING AND TALKING TO. </p><p> </p><p>22.  ALHAJI BAWA GARBA.  WHEN GOD MADE "ABG," HE BROKE </p><p>THE MOLD.  BAWA GARBA IS THE SATTELITE TELEVISION MOGUL </p><p>OF NIGERIA, AND HAS BRANCHED INTO TELEVISION ASSEMBLY, </p><p>SECURITY DEVICES AND OTHER MANUFACTURES.  HE HAS A </p><p>PROMOTIONAL PATTER THAT COULD COME STRAIGHT FROM </p><p>HOLLYWOOD, EXCEPT FOR THE STRONG HAUSA ACCENT.  HE IS </p><p>ACCESSIBLE TO AMERICANS BUT A SOMEWHAT MORE DIFFICULT </p><p>CONVERSATION PARTNER THAN MOST NORTHERNERS, SINCE HE </p><p>FREQUENTLY TALKS OVER HIS PARTNER. </p><p> </p><p>23.  ALHAJI KASSIM MUSA BICHI, NOW IN HIS OWN BUSINESS </p><p>IN KANO BUT FORMERLY THE MANAGING DIRECTOR OF NEW </p><p>NIGERIA INVESTMENTS LIMITED, THE FINANCE BRANCH OF </p><p>NNDP, THE NORTHERN STATES\' HOLDING COMPANY.  BICHI HAS </p><p>AN M.A. IN DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS FROM WILLIAMS COLLEGE </p><p>AND IS FRIENDLY AND ENGAGING, ALTHOUGH SOMEWHAT QUICK </p><p>TO ADOPT PREJUDICES (E.G. AGAINST LEBANESE AND INDIANS </p><p>IN THE NIGERIAN ECONOMY) FLOATING ABOUT IN THE AIR.  HE </p><p>IS A DEVOUT MUSLIM, STRICTLY ADHERING TO THE DIETARY </p><p>PRACTICES AND PRAYER SCHEDULES LAID DOWN, AND OBSERVING </p><p>EXTRA FASTING AND NON-PHYSICAL CONTACT BETWEEN MEN AND </p><p>WOMEN. </p><p> </p><p>POLITICS </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>24.  GEORGE HOOMKWAP, SENATOR (NPP) IN THE SECOND </p><p>REPUBLIC AND SDP ACTIVIST IN THE THIRD, HE WAS MOST </p><p>RECENTLY A NATIONAL ASSEMBLY LIAISON OFFICER FOR THE </p><p>SHONEKAN ING.  HOOMKWAP COMES FROM PLATEAU STATE (GOMEI </p><p>GROUP NEAR SHENDAM) AND IS A CATHOLIC.  HE IS ALSO </p><p>CHAIRMAN OF THE JIB BREWERY GROUP IN JOS AND HAS HIS </p><p>OWN MULTI-PURPOSE FIRM.  HOOMKWAP FULLY INTENDS TO BE </p><p>IN THE POLITICAL WHIRLWIND WHENEVER IT STARTS BLOWING </p><p>AGAIN, AND, ALONG WITH HIS SENIOR SOLOMON LAR, HE WILL </p><p>BE AN IMPORTANT FIGURE IN PLATEAU POLITICS. </p><p> </p><p>25.  SENATOR UBA AHMED, SENATOR (NPN, THEN NRC) IN THE </p><p>SECOND AND THIRD REPUBLICS, MOST RECENTLY THE SENATE </p><p>MINORITY WHIP IN THE DISMISSED NATIONAL ASSEMBLY. </p><p>ALTHOUGH HE HAILS FROM BAUCHI STATE, HE IS ATTACHED BY </p><p>HIS BUSINESS INTERESTS TO JOS AND LAGOS.  HE HOPES SOON </p><p>TO RESUSCITATE AN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK LOAN TO </p><p>START A FISHING BUSINESS, USING BOATS PROCURED IN </p><p>ALABAMA.  HE IS A MOST ENGAGING FRIEND, WITH A GREAT </p><p>SENSE OF HUMOR.  HE LIKES AMERICANS AND IS EASY TO TALK </p><p>WITH, IF YOU CAN EVER TRACK HIM DOWN. </p><p> </p><p>26.  ALHAJI LEMA JIBRILU, CHAIRMAN OF A NUMBER OF </p><p>KADUNA COMPANIES THATSBEAR VARIOUS TRANSMUTATIONS OF </p><p>HIS INITIALS, MOSTLY BASED ON AGRIBUSINESS.  JIBRILU </p><p>WAS ONE OF THE FIRST CANDIDATES (NRC) IN THE FAILED </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS OF 1991-93 AND ONE OF THE GROUP </p><p>OF 23 DISQUALIFIED IN THE 1992 PRIMARIES.  IN THOSE </p><p>PRIMARIES, JIBRILU ACTUALLY PULLED OUT AHEAD OF THE </p><p>REST, ACCUSING HIS FELLOW CANDIDATES OF CORRUPT </p><p>PRACTICES AND SAYING HE WOULD NOT CONTEST FURTHER.  ALL </p><p>THE SAME, HE WAS DISQUALIFIED ALONG WITH THE REST.  HE </p><p>HAS BEEN WELL-KNOWN TO SUCCESSIVE GENERATIONS OF KADUNA </p><p>U.S. DIPLOMATS AND IS A PERSON OF STRONG CHARACTER AND </p><p>GREAT CHARM.  HE IS A DEVOUT MUSLIM AND HAS A CLOSE </p><p>FAMILY -- HIS TWO SONS AND DAUGHTER FROM HIS FIRST </p><p>MARRIAGE (TO AN ENGLISHWOMAN) HELP RUN PARTS OF THE </p><p>BUSINESS, AS WILL, PRESUMABLY, THE TWO YOUNG SONS OF </p><p>HIS SECOND MARRIAGE (TO A BRAZILIAN). </p><p> </p><p>THE ELDERS </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>27.  NO BIOGRAPHIC WRAP-UP CABLE WOULD BE COMPLETE </p><p>WITHOUT A LOOK AT THE ELDERS.  THE ELDEST OF THEM ALL, </p><p>ALHAJI ISA KAITA, HAS BEEN A FRIEND OF EVERY AMERICAN </p><p>CONSUL GENERAL SINCE THE BEGINNING OF TIME.  IN OUR </p><p>VIEW HE HAS BEEW A LITTLE READY TO ACCEPT WHATEVER THE </p><p>AUTHORITY OF THE DAY WISHES OR DECREES, NOT STANDING ON </p><p>ANY EASILY VISIBLE PRINCIPLE OTHER THAN AN ACCEPTANCE </p><p>OF WHAT GOD SENDS.  NEVERTHELESS, ISA KAITA IS AN </p><p>INSTITUTION.  THIS MAKES HIS CURRENT STATE VERY SAD, </p><p>SINCE HE SUFFERED A STROKE LAST FALL WHILE ON THE </p><p>LESSER PILGRIMAGE IN SAUDI ARABIA.  SINCE THAT TIME HE </p><p>HAS BEEN BEDRIDDEN AND UNABLE TO MOVE HIS RIGHT ARM AND </p><p>LEG.  ON OUR LAST CALL ON HIM, HE APPEARED DEPRESSED BY </p><p>HIS CONDITION AND SOMEWHAT MORE FRAIL. </p><p> </p><p>28.  THE THREE FRIENDS: YAHAYA GUSAU, AHMED TALIB, AND </p><p>LIMAN CIROMA.  THESE THREE, LISTED IN ORDER OF </p><p>SENIORITY, ARE GENERALLY CONSIDERED TOGETHER SINCE ALL </p><p>SERVED IN THE CIVIL SERVICE OF THE NORTHERN REGION </p><p>UNDER THE SARDAUNA.  APL THREE ARE MEN OF UPSTANDING </p><p>CHARACTER AND LONG EXPERIENCE, EXCEPTIOLT CORDIAL </p><p>AND UNFAILI GLY COURTEOAS.  YAHAYA GUSAU, AS HIS NAME </p><p>IMPLIES, COMES FROM GUSAU IN SOKOTO; AHMED TALIB FROM </p><p>BORNO, AD LIMAN CIROMA FROM POTISKUM, YOBE STATE. </p><p>GUSAU IS CURRENTLY THE CHANCELLOR OF BAYERO UNIVERSITY </p><p>KANO, WHILE TALIB AND CIROMA SERVE AS CHAIRMEN OF THE </p><p>BOARDS OF VARIOUS INTERNATIONAL COMPANIES.  CIROMA, THE </p><p>YOUNGEST, HAS BEEN A FREQUENTLY INTERLOCUTOR AND OFTEN </p><p>CALLS UP WHEN SOME EVENT (EITHER OUTRAGEOUS OR </p><p>WONDERFUL BY HIS LIGHT) HAS BEEN BROADCAST ON CNN. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>WEINLAND </p><p></p></div>
