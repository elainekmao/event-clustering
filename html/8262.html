<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 003099 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE PASS USTR FOR DOUG BELL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/22/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, ECON, EINV, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: MIDDLE EAST TRADE INITIATIVE ASSESSMENT - JORDAN </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 135263 </p><p>     B. AMMAN 2786 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edward W. Gnehm, reasons 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (c)  Senior Jordanian officials issued strongly </p><p>supportive statements both in public and in private following </p><p>the President\'s May 9 announcement regarding the Middle East </p><p>Trade Initiative.  In comments repeated privately to the </p><p>Ambassador (ref b), Planning Minister Bassem Awadallah told </p><p>the Jordan Times he welcomed the move, and expressed hope </p><p>that the initiative would stimulate long-dormant inter-Arab </p><p>trade.  When asked his views about Jordan losing its "special </p><p>relationship" with the U.S. as the only Arab country with an </p><p>FTA and QIZ status, Awadallah noted that "the age of </p><p>mercantilism is over,", and reiterated that any initiative </p><p>that enlivened the regional economy would be to Jordan\'s </p><p>benefit. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (c)  Trade Minister Salah al Bashir has made similar </p><p>remarks in meetings with Emboffs, going so far as to say that </p><p>an FTA for Egypt would be "the best thing" for Jordan.  He, </p><p>like Awadallah, believes that the initiative should increase </p><p>economic growth and activity both within the region and with </p><p>the U.S., and concludes that prosperous neighbors will offer </p><p>the best opportunities to create a more prosperous Jordan. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (c)  These initial reactions indicate strong support for </p><p>the President\'s initiative.  As a country that has made </p><p>significant progress, often at great political risk, on its </p><p>economic reform agenda, Jordan already benefits from most of </p><p>the programs on offer through the initiative.  The GOJ will </p><p>hope to play a leadership role in helping to roll out the </p><p>initiative, and may even want to offer technical assistance </p><p>to other countries in the region that need to upgrade </p><p>legislation or procedures.  To that end, the GOJ might </p><p>support programs under the initiative that factor in </p><p>capacity-building opportunities for rejuvenating inter-Arab </p><p>trade.  Jordan would likely be particularly interested in </p><p>docking agreements and cumulation clauses that would spur </p><p>trade with other countries in the region. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (c)  While we expect strong support from Jordan for this </p><p>initiative, we also expect some degree of sensitivity.  The </p><p>GOJ will expect new beneficiaries of U.S. preference programs </p><p>and agreements - whether QIZ\'s, FTA\'s, BIT\'s, or assistance </p><p>with WTO accession - to be held to the same high political </p><p>and economic standards to which Jordan was held in </p><p>negotiating its own agreements.  Thus, for example, they will </p><p>expect any new QIZ agreements to require 11.7% Israeli </p><p>content in finished goods, the highest (i.e., "TRIPS-plus") </p><p>protections for intellectual property rights, especially in </p><p>the pharmaceutical field, and minimal product category </p><p>exclusions for tariff reduction schedules under new FTA\'s. </p><p>If it appears that neighboring countries are getting "easier" </p><p>terms, the GOJ will argue vociferously that other countries </p><p>should have to meet the same standards that Jordan attained </p><p>when it secured its original agreements. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
