PRESIDENT MUGABE HAS APPOINTED THREE ADDITIONAL </p><p>SUPREME COURT JUDGES, BRINGING THE TOTAL NUMBER OF JUSTICES </p><p>ON THE COUNTRY\'S HIGHEST COURT TO EIGHT.  MINISTER OF </p><p>JUSTICE PATRICK CHINAMASA ANNOUNCED THAT THE NEW </p><p>APPOINTMENTS WERE MADE IN PREPARATION FOR AN EXPECTED </p><p>INCREASE IN WORKLOAD.  THE ADDITIONAL WORKLOAD, HE SAID, </p><p>WOULD RESULT FROM APPEALS FROM A NEWLY-CREATED LABOR </p><p>TRIBUNAL AND FROM AN EXPANDED ADMINISTRATIVE COURT, WHICH </p><p>IS HEARING CHALLENGES FROM FARMERS WHOSE PROPERTIES HAVE </p><p>BEEN LISTED FOR COMPULSORY ACQUISITION UNDER THE FAST-TRACK </p><p>RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM.  PRIOR TO THEIR SWEARING-IN ON AUGUST </p><p>2, THE THREE NEWCOMERS -- MISHECK CHEDA AND LUKE MALABA </p><p>FROM THE BULAWAYO HIGH COURT AND VERNANDA ZIYAMBI FROM THE </p><p>HARARE HIGH COURT -- ALL PRESIDED AS SENIOR JUDGES. </p><p> </p><p>2. THE NEW APPOINTMENTS HAVE RAISED EYEBROWS AMONG SOME </p><p>MEMBERS OF THE LEGAL COMMUNITY, WHO BELIEVE THE PRESIDENT </p><p>IS TRYING TO PACK THE COURT WITH HIS SUPPORTERS.  EILEEN </p><p>SAWYER, DIRECTOR OF THE LEGAL RESOURCES FOUNDATION, TOLD US </p><p>THAT THERE WAS NO REASON TO APPOINT ADDITIONAL JUDGES, AS </p><p>THE CURRENT MEMBERS OF THE BENCH WERE NOT PARTICULARLY </p><p>BUSY.  LAW SOCIETY PRESIDENT STERNFORD MOYO, HOWEVER, </p><p>MAINTAINED THAT THE NEW MEMBERS OF THE BENCH COULD NOT BE </p><p>CONSIDERED  STOOGES OF ZANU-PF.  HE DESCRIBED JUSTICE CHEDA </p><p>AS A "SOUND JUDGE" WHO RENDERS JUDGMENTS BASED ON HIS </p><p>READING OF THE LAW, NOT POLITICAL AFFILIATION.  MOYO CITED </p><p>AS AN EXAMPLE CHEDA\'S PUBLIC CRITICISM OF FORMER HIGH COURT </p><p>JUDGE PRESIDENT, AND CURRENT ACTING CHIEF JUSTICE, GODFREY </p><p>CHIDYAUSIKU FOR ISSUING A PRO-GOVERNMENT RULING ON THE FAST- </p><p>TRACK RESETTLEMENT EFFORT WHICH CONTRADICTED A PREVIOUS </p><p>SUPREME COURT DECISION.  CHEDA CALLED CHIDYAUSIKU\'S RULING </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02345  081245Z </p><p>"ERRONEOUS."  MOYOOYO DESCRIBED JUSTICE MALABA AS A "SOUND </p><p>AND CAPABLE LAWYER, PERHAPS ONE OF THE MOST ABLE IN </p><p>MATABELELAND", AND SAID HE HAS A STRONG HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>BACKGROUND.  ALTHOUGH SOME OBSERVERS BELIEVE THAT ZIYAMBI </p><p>DOES NOT POSSESS THE SAME CALIBER OF LEGAL MIND AS HER TWO </p><p>COUNTERPARTS AND ARE SUSPICIOUS OF HER CONNECTIONS TO ZANU- </p><p>PF (HER HUSBAND WAS MINISTER OF JUSTICE WHEN HE DIED IN A </p><p>CAR ACCIDENT ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO), MOYO THOUGHT HER STRONG </p><p>RELIGIOUS CONVICTIONS WOULD PLAY A MORE IMPORTANT ROLE IN </p><p>GUIDING HER DECISIONS THAN ANY POLITICAL SYMPATHIES. </p><p>(COMMENT:  WE UNDERSTAND FROM OTHER SOURCES THAT MANY OF </p><p>ZIYAMBI\'S RELATIVES, INCLUDING HER CHILDREN, BLAME ZANU-PF </p><p>FOR STAGING THE ACCIDENT IN WHICH HER HUSBAND DIED, </p><p>ALTHOUGH ZIYAMBI\'S OWN THOUGHTS ON THIS ISSUE ARE NOT </p><p>CLEAR.  END COMMENT.)  MOYO NOTED THAT ZIYAMBI IS THE FIRST </p><p>WOMAN APPOINTED TO THE SUPREME COURT. </p><p> </p><p>5. </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  3.MANY OBSERVERS HAVE BEEN EXPECTING PRESIDENT MUGABE </p><p>TO PACK THE COURT FOR SOME TIME TO DILUTE THE INFLUENCE OF </p><p>THE REMAINING JUSTICES, TWO OF WHOM ARE NOT BLACK.  THE </p><p>CONSTITUTION OF ZIMBABWE PERMITS THE PRESIDENT TO APPOINT </p><p>AS MANY JUSTICES AS HE SEES FIT; IT ESTABLISHES ONLY A </p><p>MINIMUM NUMBER OF JUDGES (FIVE) THAT MUST OCCUPY THE BENCH. </p><p>. </p><p>GIVEN THE STRONG INDEPENDENT BACKGROUNDS OF TWO OF THE </p><p>THREE NEW APPOINTMENTS, IT IS UNLIKELY THAT THE GOZ CAN </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02345  081245Z </p><p>COUNT ON THEM TO AUTOMATICALLY DO ITS BIDDING.  MORE </p><p>LIKELY, THE PRESIDENT IS PROBABLY LOOKING FOR A SUPREME </p><p>COURT THAT IS "BLACKER," AND IN HIS CALCULATION, MORE </p><p>SYMPATHETIC TO THE RULING PARTY.  HOWEVER, MUGABE STILL </p><p>WANTS A COURT THAT IS RESPECTABLE AND NOT BLATANTLY </p><p>PARTISAN BECAUSE HE VALUES A COURT THAT CAN PUT A CREDIBLE </p><p>STAMP OF LEGALITY ON HIS LAND SEIZURE PROGRAM AND OTHER </p><p>LAWS RESTRICTING POLITICAL FREEDOM.  WE NOTE THAT GODFREY </p><p>CHIDYAUSIKU HAS NOT YET BEEN SWORN IN AS CHIEF JUSTICE; HE </p><p>HAS BEEN ACTING CHIEF JUSTICE FOR MORE THAN A MONTH.  HE </p><p>HAS COME UNDER WIDESPREAD CRITICISM FROM THE LEGAL </p><p>COMMUNITY, AND THE GOVERNMENT MAY BE RETHINKING HIS </p><p>PERMANENT APPOINTMENT.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>HOOKS </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
