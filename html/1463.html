IRVING FOR </p><p>REASONS 1.5 (D). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) IN HIS HOUR-LONG END OF YEAR MESSAGE DECEMBER </p><p>27, PRESIDENT MUGABE GAVE HIS VERSION OF EVENTS IN THE </p><p>YEAR 2000.  HE ATTRIBUTED THE COUNTRY\'S DIFFICULT </p><p>ECONOMIC PATCH TO FALLING COMMODITY AND RISING INPUT </p><p>PRICES AS WELL AS RESERVE BANK MONETARY POLICY.  HE </p><p>REHEARSED THE REASONS FOR THE FAST-TRACK LAND REFORM </p><p>PROGRAM AND BLAMED THE GREED OF THE "ANGLO-SAXON" </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARMERS FOR HAMPERING PROGRESS.  HE CONDEMNED </p><p>THE OPPOSITION MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE FOR </p><p>ATTEMPTING TO COME TO POWER THROUGH VIOLENT MEANS AND </p><p>PURSUING A SEDITIOUS POLITICAL AGENDA.  HE SAID THE YEAR </p><p>HAD BEEN A DIFFICULT ONE AND THANKED PEOPLE FOR THEIR </p><p>FORBEARANCE WITH THE SHORTAGES OF FUEL.  THE SPEECH, </p><p>RIDDLED WITH FACTUAL INACCURACIES, LOGICAL </p><p>INCONSISTENCIES AND NOT-SO-VEILED THREATS, SUCCEEDED IN </p><p>EMBARRASSING ALL BUT THE MOST ARDENT ZANU-PF SUPPORTERS </p><p>PRESENT.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) PRESIDENT MUGABE DELIVERED HIS END-OF-YEAR </p><p>MESSAGE TO AN ESTIMATED 500 GUESTS AT A STATE HOUSE </p><p>RECEPTION DECEMBER 27.  THE PRESIDENT, WHO SPOKE FOR AN </p><p>HOUR, OFTEN DEPARTED FROM HIS PREPARED TEXT.  THE SPEECH </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  07273  01 OF 04  281607Z </p><p>WAS AN EMBARRASSMENT; IT WAS BREATHTAKING IN ITS </p><p>INTELLECTUAL DISHONESTY, LOGICAL INCONSISTENCY AND NOT- </p><p>SO-VEILED THREATS.  AUDIENCE REACTION WAS MUTED WITH THE </p><p>EXCEPTION OF THE OCCASIONAL "HEAR, HEAR," SHOUTED BY </p><p>SOME OF THE MORE ZEALOUS OF THE PARTY FAITHFUL. </p><p>MINISTER OF INDUSTRY AND INTERNATIONAL TRADE NKOSANA </p><p>MOYO CONFIDED TO THE AUSTRALIAN HIGH COMMISSIONER HERE </p><p>THAT HE FELT "SHATTERED" FOLLOWING THE PRESIDENT\'S SPEECH. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) MUGABE LED OFF BY MAKING A POINT OF GREETING </p><p>THOSE IN ATTENDANCE FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND THE </p><p>PARASTATALS.  HE SEEMED TO BE ALIGNING GOVERNMENT WITH </p><p>THESE TWO GROUPS AND MADE MENTION OF THE FACT THAT THEY </p><p>HAD STOOD TOGETHER IN SOLIDARITY TO COMBAT THE FORCES </p><p>FROM OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY.  HE THEN CALLED THE </p><p>INDEPENDENT "DAILY NEWS" NEWSPAPER THE "DAILY LIARS," </p><p>AND SAID THAT THEY AND THE OPPOSITION MOVEMENT FOR </p><p>DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC) DID NOT KNOW THE DIFFERENCE </p><p>BETWEEN A BANQUET AND A RECEPTION.  (COMMENT: THIS WAS A </p><p>JAB AT THE MDC FOR BOYCOTTING THE EVENT.  THE "DAILY </p><p>NEWS" REPORTED ON THE DECEMBER 27 THAT THE OPPOSITION </p><p>PARTY SAID IT COULD NOT ATTEND SUCH A LAVISH EVENT WITH </p><p>THE SUFFERING GOING ON OVER THIS LAST YEAR.  END </p><p>COMMENT). </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>THE ECONOMY IS NOT OUR FAULT </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) THE PRESIDENT ADMITTED THAT IT HAD BEEN A </p><p>DIFFICULT YEAR FOR EVERYONE.  HE SAID THE MAIN CAUSE WAS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  07273  01 OF 04  281607Z </p><p>THE DOWNWARD PRICE OF ZIMBABWE\'S MINERALS, ESPECIALLY </p><p>GOLD, WHICH HE LABELED (INCORRECTLY) AS THE MAIN SOURCE </p><p>OF ZIMBABWE\'S FOREIGN EXCHANGE, FOLLOWED BY TOBACCO. </p><p>THIS SET THE TREND FOR GREAT HARDSHIPS.  ON THE OTHER </p><p>HAND, HE STATED, "THERE ARE AREAS WHERE THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>IS BLAMED FOR FOLLOWING THE WRONG POLICIES.  ECONOMICS </p><p>IS NOT A SCIENCE OF CERTAINTY.  IT IS A SCIENCE OF </p><p>ASSUMPTIONS.  PRICES INCREASE BECAUSE OF DEMAND OR OTHER </p><p>FORCES.  IN THE CASE OF ZIMBABWE, THEY INCREASE BECAUSE </p><p>OF \'COST-PUSH INFLATION.\'"  (COMMENT: SOUTH AFRICA, THE </p><p>SOURCE FOR 60 PERCENT OF IMPORTS, HAD AN INFLATION RATE </p><p>OF UNDER FIVE PERCENT THIS YEAR.  END COMMENT).  HE </p><p>CONTINUED, "WE GET MATERIALS FROM ABROAD AND WE HAVE TO </p><p>PAY THE SUPPLIERS\' PRICES.  WE HAVE NO CONTROL OVER </p><p>THESE PRICES </p><p></p></div>
