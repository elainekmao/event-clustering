<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 04 ANKARA 004500 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/18/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: SCENESETTER FOR ADM NATTER JULY 20-22 VISIT TO </p><p>ANKARA </p><p> </p><p>Classified by DCM Robert S. Deutsch.  Reason: 1.5 (b)(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (S)  Summary:  Your visit comes as we try to close the </p><p>July 4 incident and pull Turkey into a more fully helpful </p><p>role in Iraq. The last year has shaken the confidence of the </p><p>Turkish public, politicians, and military in the strength of </p><p>the relationship with the U.S., just as it has shaken our </p><p>confidence in the Turks.  While we have been able to manage </p><p>the issue of the July 4 incident, it is likely to fester for </p><p>a long time in the minds of many Turks as a humiliation to </p><p>the military, and could thus continue to affect U.S.-Turkey </p><p>security cooperation broadly.  In part, our problems come </p><p>from divergent views on Iraq, particularly the security </p><p>threat from various possible development in northern Iraq. </p><p>However, in large part they are also a function of Turkish </p><p>domestic politics.  The ruling AK Party is seen as a threat </p><p>to the existing order of Turkey that the military and much of </p><p>the Establishment is trying to defend -- and the military is </p><p>seen as a barrier to the changes AK and others would like to </p><p>make in Turkey.  The relationship with the U.S., the reforms </p><p>needed for the EU and even the range of Iraq issues have been </p><p>approached, frequently, by both sides in the context of the </p><p>relationship between the military/traditional Establishment </p><p>and AK, rather than on their merits.  In reacting to the July </p><p>4 incident, P.M. Erdogan and F.M. Gul maintained a measured </p><p>approach, while the TGS, under pressure from military </p><p>hard-liners, refused any responsibility and stirred national </p><p>outrage.  The implications of the internal political dynamic </p><p>for the wider issue of GOT Iraq policy are considerable. </p><p>Civilian authorities would like to complete a transformation </p><p>of Iraq policy away from the historic northern-Iraq centered </p><p>obsession and fear of a Kurdish state -- a change in focus </p><p>that stems in part from efforts by the MFA and other civilian </p><p>authorities to wrestle control over Turkey\'s Iraq policy from </p><p>the Turkish military.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>The Domestic Context </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) F.M. Gul and P.M. Erdogan have maintained a measured </p><p>approach to the incident in Iraq in order to protect our </p><p>bilateral relationship and to press its proposed reform </p><p>package to loosen the TGS\'s grip on Turkish policy.  However, </p><p>to keep their political opponents off balance, they have </p><p>publicly been supportive of the military.  The hard-liners </p><p>saw the event as a way to resist AK\'s effort and weaken its </p><p>standing by attacking it as an American "supporter."  Thus, </p><p>the AK stance contrasts starkly with the reaction from the </p><p>military, President Sezer, and opposition CHP, all of whom </p><p>have used the press to castigate both AK for being "too soft" </p><p>and the U.S. for its actions.  After the release of the joint </p><p>statement the Turkish press focused on the absence of an </p><p>apology. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) U.S.-Turkey tensions fit into a complex competition </p><p>between AK and the military. They portray themselves as </p><p>having opposed visions of Turkey\'s future.  Within each group </p><p>there are tensions too.  There are increasing signs of </p><p>discontent among hard-liners in the senior military </p><p>leadership, who are trying to force TGS chief Ozkok into a </p><p>more confrontational stance toward the USG as a way to rally </p><p>nationalism and counter AK.  The difference between the AK </p><p>Government and the Establishment on this front highlights a </p><p>basic gap in Turkey between those -- led in the first </p><p>instance by the military hawks -- who support an order linked </p><p>to a rigid, statist-oriented view of what Ataturk wanted for </p><p>the Republic of Turkey, and those who say they want a more </p><p>open, EU candidacy-linked, conservative Turkey, with greater </p><p>opportunity for Islamic influences, to prevail.  In this </p><p>political competition there are also question marks regarding </p><p>AK\'s: 1) ultimate social, political, and economic intentions </p><p>domestically; and 2) its ability to run a competent </p><p>government and willingness to respond to U.S. interests.  The </p><p>domestic competition is often more important to the TGS or AK </p><p>than the issues being addressed, and many U.S.-Turkey </p><p>questions are dealt with as fodder as much as on their </p><p>merits. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>Iraq: Signs of a Shift In Policy </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (S) Turkey\'s civilian authorities would like to complete a </p><p>transformation of Iraq policy away from the historic </p><p>northern-Iraq centered obsession with border security, fear </p><p>of a Kurdish state, and Turkish military presence towards a </p><p>more Baghdad-oriented policy based primarily on trade and </p><p>assistance.  This change in focus, to the extent it has been </p><p>realized, appears to stem in part from efforts by the MFA and </p><p>other civilian authorities to wrestle control over Turkey\'s </p><p>Iraq policy from the Turkish military.  During a recent </p><p>one-on-one with the Ambassador, MFA U/S Ziyal said he had </p><p>asked P.M. Erdogan after the end of combat operations in Iraq </p><p>to transfer authority over the issue of northern Iraq (and </p><p>Iraq) from the TGS to the MFA.  However, the detention of TSF </p><p>by the U.S. military in northern Iraq on July 4 has raised </p><p>suspicions on both sides of the other\'s intentions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) The Turks have taken a number of concrete steps in </p><p>humanitarian assistance and reconstruction since the </p><p>Secretary\'s April visit to Turkey. Turkey has become a hub </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>for facilitating the flow of humanitarian assistance to </p><p>northern Iraq.  The World Food Program has shipped 341,000 </p><p>tons of food through Turkey since March.  Turkey is also the </p><p>world\'s biggest supplier (in value terms) to WFP.  Turkey </p><p>recently allowed an energy barter arrangement organized by </p><p>Delta Petroleum to go forward.  This will enable coalition </p><p>authorities to supply essential energy supplies to the Iraqi </p><p>people. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Turkey has an opportunity to build strong trade links </p><p>with Iraq.  During his Washington meetings in June, MFA U/S </p><p>Ziyal raised Turkey\'s interest in building a second border </p><p>crossing to relieve the burden on the Habur Gate (now </p><p>handling some 2000 vehicles daily).  Bottlenecks in </p><p>processing vehicles continue on both sides of the border, </p><p>with the KDP continuing to charge some (including UN) </p><p>vehicles fees and the GOT carefully scrutinizing incoming </p><p>trucks to limit fuel smuggling.  The Turks have applied to </p><p>reestablish THY commercial air links with Iraq when that </p><p>becomes feasible. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>Relations with Iraqi Kurds </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) The MFA has portrayed the mid-May visit to Iraq by a </p><p>three-person MFA delegation as improving Turkish-Kurdish </p><p>relations.  The Turkish delegation found both KDP leader </p><p>Barzani and PUK leader Talabani willing to take concrete </p><p>steps to improve relations.  The MFA delegation proposed a </p><p>number of confidence-building measures designed to improve </p><p>relations, including: (1) more equitable and transparent </p><p>duties charged to Turkish businesses crossing the border; (2) </p><p>softening of rhetoric between Kurdish and Turkmen groups in </p><p>Iraq; (3) establishment of Turkish-Kurdish joint ventures in </p><p>the north; and (4) establishment of "one-stop shopping" in </p><p>key northern Iraqi cities for Turkish business groups. </p><p>Barzani reportedly committed in principle to taking steps to </p><p>improve Kurdish-Turkmen relations, but said he could not </p><p>"change course overnight."  He said the KDP would explore </p><p>taking incremental steps toward improving relations, and said </p><p>that that much would depend on the actions of the Turkmen. </p><p>The KDP and PUK leaders also reportedly heeded Turkey\'s </p><p>request to refrain from calling for the end of the Peace </p><p>Monitoring Force and the withdrawal of the Turkish </p><p>participating troops at least until the end of the year to </p><p>give the Turkish military time to "feel more comfortable" </p><p>with the overall security situation on the ground in Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) The GOT remains concerned about what it perceives to </p><p>be undue Kurdish influence on coalition authorities in </p><p>northern Iraq.  They have strongly objected to coalition </p><p>plans to disarm all groups except the Kurds, which they </p><p>believe gives the Kurds too much power over the other ethnic </p><p>groups, particularly the Turkmen. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>Turkmen in Iraq </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) While the GOT remains concerned about the fate of </p><p>Turkmen, the frequency and tone of Turkish "complaints" of </p><p>mistreatment of the Turkmen by other Iraqi groups have </p><p>declined significantly.  The military has tried to play the </p><p>Turkmen card for several years, but civilian officials appear </p><p>to have made a conscious decision to change the way they talk </p><p>about the Turkmen.  The nearly daily reports of Kurdish </p><p>efforts to marginalize Turkmen have been replaced by </p><p>statements about the importance of ensuring proportionate </p><p>representation for all Iraqi groups in local and central </p><p>decision-making bodies.  The MFA regularly talks about the </p><p>need for the Iraqi Turkmen Front to become a real political </p><p>party, to not be seen as a tool of Ankara, and to integrate </p><p>itself into the political process in Iraq.  The GOT continues </p><p>to look to the U.S. to help ensure proper Turkmen </p><p>representation on key leadership councils in the north as </p><p>well as in the IIA.  They have expressed disappointment that </p><p>only one Turkmen, who is not part of the ITF leadership, was </p><p>named to the Governing Council. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>EU Candidacy </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Since coming to power in the November elections, the </p><p>ruling AK Party has made EU membership a top priority.  The </p><p>GOT in January adopted two EU-related legislative reform </p><p>packages designed to crack down on torture and remove </p><p>barriers to free expression, association, and fair trial. </p><p>Parliament adopted another package June 19, the sixth package </p><p>in the past two years, and the GOT plans to pass a seventh </p><p>package before a parliamentary recess in August.  Our </p><p>contacts have confirmed press reports that the seventh </p><p>package will be focused on limiting the military\'s political </p><p>influence, including measures that will change the structure </p><p>of the National Security Council.  However, the pro-EU, </p><p>pro-reform AK government faces opposition from nationalistic </p><p>opponents in the bureaucracy and parts of the military.  In </p><p>several instances, bureaucratic institutions have undermined </p><p>reform legislation by developing highly restrictive </p><p>implementing regulations.  For example, Parliament lifted </p><p>restrictions on Kurdish language broadcasting, but the </p><p>subsequent Radio and Television Board regulation set strict </p><p>time limits and restricted such broadcasts to state-owned </p><p>media outlets.  In addition, our European contacts say that </p><p>while the GOT has made impressive legal reforms, Turkey\'s </p><p>standing in the EU has also been undermined by recent actions </p><p>such as the closing of the pro-Kurdish HADEP party and </p><p>indictment of its sister party, DEHAP, and the recent police </p><p>raid of the Human Rights Association\'s Ankara offices. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>Turkish Military </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (S) Contacts in the MFA, press, and among national </p><p>security analysts think the Turkish military misjudged </p><p>Turkey\'s equities in Iraq after the end of operations and </p><p>that TGS\'s efforts to use the Turkmen issue as a wedge </p><p>against U.S. policy was a mistake.  TGS D/CHOD Buyukanit, </p><p>regarded as one of the senior officers pushing a harder line </p><p>against the US during the Iraq war, also admitted that the </p><p>Turkish military had misplayed its hand on Iraq.  While </p><p>arguing that both sides had made mistakes and defending </p><p>(without great conviction) TGS\'s attempts to persuade the </p><p>Parliament to pass the March 1 troop deployment resolution, </p><p>Buyukanit had said -- before the July 4 incident -- that TGS </p><p>was ready to move forward with the U.S.  TGS supported the </p><p>recent Cabinet decree to allow the U.S. and other coalition </p><p>partners to use Turkish bases and ports for operations </p><p>consistent with UNSCR 1483, including a positive response in </p><p>principle to EUCOM\'s request to station up to 10 tankers and </p><p>1 ISR aircraft at Incirlik in support of OEF and OIF </p><p>operations (EUCOM is in the process of reviewing TGS\'s </p><p>operating guidelines for the deployment and stationing of the </p><p>aircraft, but we are taking a slow approach in the wake of </p><p>the detention of TSF in Iraq). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) TGS asserts privately and publicly that it supports </p><p>Turkey\'s EU candidacy and wants to adopt stances on important </p><p>issues (i.e. non-military approach to PKK/KADEK) that would </p><p>help Turkey vis-a-vis the EU.  However, top military officers </p><p>also have recently publicly criticized the EU and taken </p><p>measures to delay EU-related reforms.  Many continue to </p><p>believe that TGS was behind President Sezer\'s recent decision </p><p>to veto an article of the GOT\'s 6th EU-related reform package </p><p>and that the Turkish military will continue to resist all </p><p>efforts by AK to lessen the military\'s control over what it </p><p>considers to be its sacred role in protecting Turkey\'s </p><p>"secular" status and national security interests. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (S) On the TGS horizon is the August Supreme Military </p><p>Council (YAS).  Among the four-star ranks, both the Navy and </p><p>Air Force commanders retire this year, as will the commanders </p><p>of the First and Third Turkish Armies, and the National </p><p>Security Council Secretary General.  The YAS could allow </p><p>Ozkok, who is beginning the second year of his four-year tour </p><p>as Chief of the Turkish General Staff, the first real </p><p>opportunity to shape his own leadership team.  Last year, </p><p>contrary to tradition, the outgoing chief made all the </p><p>general officer assignment and promotion selections.  Ozkok, </p><p>however, may be constrained by the hard-liners and other </p><p>traditionalists with whom he is contending on a number of </p><p>issues. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>The Economy </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. (SBU) The economy is sending mixed signals.  On the one </p><p>hand, there are solid signs of growth and declining </p><p>inflation.  On the other hand, after having rallied strongly </p><p>in the aftermath of the Iraq operation, particularly once the </p><p>USG announced it would provide $1 billion in financial </p><p>assistance, markets have stalled due to the lack of investor </p><p>confidence in the government\'s commitment to reform. </p><p>As a result, interest rates on the extremely large </p><p>government debt remain high, and the economy remains </p><p>vulnerable to a sharp depreciation of the currency, which </p><p>would put the entire program and economic stability at risk. </p><p>We need to stress the importance of Turkey flawlessly </p><p>implementing its commitments to the IMF.  Disbursement of USD </p><p>1 billion in U.S. assistance is contingent on continued </p><p>implementation of the IMF program. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15. (SBU) In June, MFA U/S Ziyal and U/S Larson agreed to </p><p>convene a fall meeting of the Economic Partnership Commission </p><p>(EPC), which was established in early 2002 to find ways to </p><p>enhance the bilateral economic relationship.  The meeting </p><p>will be an opportunity to press a broad economic agenda </p><p>including structural reform, reduction of trade barriers </p><p>improving the investment climate, and enhancing regional </p><p>economic cooperation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
