<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 002989 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/20/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, SOCI, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDAN\'S POLITICAL PARTIES: ISLAMISTS, LEFTISTS, </p><p>NATIONALISTS AND CENTRISTS </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edward W. Gnehm.  Reasons 1.5 (B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) This cable provides background on Jordan\'s political </p><p>parties participating in upcoming parliamentary elections on </p><p>June 17.  Jordan\'s political landscape, runs the gamut from </p><p>religious to secular and from left to right, complicated by </p><p>tribal and family loyalties.  The Islamic Action Front, the </p><p>political arm of the Muslim Brotherhood, is by far the </p><p>largest, best funded and organized of all the political </p><p>parties.  The other parties, smaller and less well organized, </p><p>often form blocs to field candidates during parliamentary </p><p>elections. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>ISLAMIST POLITICAL PARTIES </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) The Islamic Action Front (IAF), by far the largest and </p><p>best organized political party in Jordan, was founded in 1992 </p><p>by Muslim Brotherhood members and independent Islamists. </p><p>Membership is estimated to be around 5,000.  There are two </p><p>factions within the party, the "doves" and the "hawks".  The </p><p>doves advocate openness, avoid confrontation with the </p><p>government and believe in constructive opposition regarding </p><p>the MEPP.  Conversely, the hawks are hard liners who oppose </p><p>such a conciliatory policy.  The IAF platform opposes the </p><p>GOJ\'s peace treaty with Israel and calls for the </p><p>implementation of Islamic Shari\'a law.  The IAF boycotted the </p><p>1997 parliamentary elections protesting the so-called "one </p><p>man one vote" voting structure which, it claimed, unfairly </p><p>diluted its true electoral strength.  The IAF has announced, </p><p>however, that although the "one man one vote" structure is </p><p>still in place it will participate in the June elections. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Two other political parties round out the Islamist </p><p>political scene in Jordan with membership estimates at under </p><p>100 for each.  The Democratic Arab Islamic Movement (Du\'a\') </p><p>and the Muslim Centrist party are both moderate in nature. </p><p>The Du\'a\' party is composed of both Muslims and Christians </p><p>and men and women, its aim being the enhancement of the </p><p>Muslim-Christian relationship.  Its platform supports the </p><p>Palestinian cause, the independence of the judiciary, better </p><p>education opportunities, free media and enhanced economic, </p><p>social, cultural and political domains.  It is one of five </p><p>parties comprising the National Council for Parties </p><p>Coordination bloc.  The Du\'a\'s partners are the National </p><p>Constitution, Al-Ajyal, Al-Ummah and the Greens. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) The Muslim Centrist party advocates democracy and </p><p>pluralism.  It is open to all members of the society </p><p>regardless of their religion, ethnic origin or affiliation. </p><p>It supports a role for women in society, student movements </p><p>and the economic and political reforms launched 12 years ago. </p><p> Many of its members are former Muslim Brothers who either </p><p>left the movement or were dismissed due to differences of </p><p>opinion. </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>LEFTIST BLOC </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) The main leftist party is the Jordanian Communist </p><p>Party established in 1951.  Estimates place membership at </p><p>under 200 for each of the leftist parties.  The party is </p><p>committed to the causes of the masses, defending their </p><p>interests and voicing their aspirations.  The Jordanian </p><p>Democratic Left party was established in 1994 by a former </p><p>Communist party member and sole Communist deputy member in </p><p>the 1989-1993 parliament.  This party seeks to depart from </p><p>the narrow ideology of Stalinism and opposes Jordan\'s peace </p><p>treaty with Israel.  The Jordanian People\'s Democratic party </p><p>(HASHD), the Jordanian Democratic Popular Unity party and the </p><p>Jordanian Communist Workers Party round out the leftist </p><p>political spectrum in Jordan.  All three follow a similar </p><p>leftist ideology which opposes economic reform programs, the </p><p>Oslo agreement, and Jordan\'s peace treaty with Israel.  The </p><p>Communist Worker\'s party also calls on the GOJ to refrain </p><p>from accepting World Bank and IMF conditions on Jordan, </p><p>blaming such conditions for the high rate of unemployment in </p><p>the Kingdom. </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>NATIONALISTS </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) The Nationalist political parties are offshoots of the </p><p>Ba\'thist pan Arab movement.  The main three parties are the </p><p>Jordan Arab Socialist Ba\'thists, the Ba\'th Arab Progressives </p><p>and the National Action Party.  They all oppose the MEPP and </p><p>Jordan\'s economic reform programs.  All three had close </p><p>affiliations with the leadership in Iraq and Syria. </p><p>Membership in each party is estimated to be under 200. </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>CENTRISTS </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) The Centrist parties are the National Constitutional </p><p>Party, Al-Nahda, the Jordanian Generations Party and the </p><p>Greens with members numbering in the hundreds.  The first </p><p>three parties all advocate democracy as essential allowing </p><p>people to exercise their sovereignty and become the ruling </p><p>power by expressing their will and achieving their </p><p>aspirations.  They all support the establishment of a </p><p>Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital.  The Greens </p><p>focus on Jordan\'s environmental issues and making Jordanians </p><p>aware of the sources and causes of pollution. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Of Jordan\'s many political parties, the only one </p><p>considered genuinely influential is the IAF.  The rest are </p><p>small and in disarray.  Even with the forming of political </p><p>blocs to improve their chances during elections, infighting </p><p>and dissension within the blocs limit their influence over </p><p>Jordan\'s political landscape.  Evidence of the </p><p>ineffectiveness of Jordan\'s political parties is that most </p><p>members in the last parliament ran as independents with no </p><p>political party affiliation and the same result can be </p><p>expected during the upcoming elections.  Many analysts blame </p><p>the GOJ for not promoting a vibrant political environment and </p><p>argue that the government supports such a political </p><p>wasteland.  For its part, the GOJ states that it envisions </p><p>the formation of three political parties, left, center and </p><p>right, as a more viable solution to the current splintered </p><p>political climate.  In our view, while the development of </p><p>effective political parties is an integral part of the </p><p>maturation of democracy in Jordan, it is not something that </p><p>can be done from the top down, but must be an element in the </p><p>larger progress toward a vibrant civil society. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
