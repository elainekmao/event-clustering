IRVING FOR </p><p>REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY: PRESIDENT MUGABE IS IN CRUSADE MODE, </p><p>CAMPAIGNING FOR HIS PARTY\'S CAPTURE OF THE PRESIDENCY IN </p><p>2002.  HE HAS MADE CLEAR HIS LEGACY WILL BE THAT OF THE </p><p>BLACK ZIMBABWEAN WHO FOUGHT AGAINST THE WORLD TO RETURN </p><p>THE LAND TO HIS PEOPLE, REGARDLESS OF THE DAMAGE DONE TO </p><p>THE COUNTRY AND THE ECONOMY.  WE FULLY EXPECT HIS </p><p>GOVERNMENT TO GAZETTE THE COMPULSORY ACQUISITION OF </p><p>3,000 FARMS, ALTHOUGH WE QUESTION WHETHER IT COULD </p><p>FOLLOW THROUGH ON THE REST OF ITS PROMISES.  THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT DOES NOT HAVE THE MONEY TO ACQUIRE THAT MANY </p><p>FARMS UNDER CURRENT RULES, AND THE INTERNAL DISPLACEMENT </p><p>OF PEOPLE AND FOOD INSECURITY RESULTING FROM </p><p>RESETTLEMENT IN THE TIME FRAME ENVISIONED WOULD SPELL </p><p>DISASTER.  THE ENSUING ECOLOGICAL NIGHTMARE, AS THE </p><p>DESTITUTE AND UNTRAINED "LAND-STARVED" PEASANTRY </p><p>PRACTICE SUBSISTENCE FARMING ON NOW PRODUCTIVE LAND </p><p>SLOWLY TURNING IT INTO A MOONSCAPE, WOULD COMPLETE THE </p><p>PICTURE.  ECONOMICS DO NOT FORM PART OF THE PRESIDENT\'S </p><p>POLITICAL DISCOURSE, AND INDEED IT IS ONLY THROUGH A </p><p>POLITICAL PRISM THAT ONE CAN BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND THE </p><p>PRESIDENT\'S SEEMINGLY ERRATIC ACTIONS.  ON THE SAME DAY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  04362  01 OF 03  071408Z </p><p>HIS FINANCE MINISTER TOUTED THE INTRODUCTION OF MEASURES </p><p>TO REVERSE THE SLIDE, MUGABE WAS INSULTING DONORS ON </p><p>NATIONAL TELEVISION.  THE PRESIDENT ALSO PUBLICLY </p><p>CONTRADICTS HIS SENIOR NDEBELE PARTY MEMBERS, A FACT </p><p>THAT WILL STRETCH THE FABRIC OF THE ZANU-PF UNITY ACCORD </p><p>TO THE LIMIT.  IN SPITE OF THE DAMAGE MUGABE HAS </p><p>INFLICTED TO THE COUNTRY AND EVEN HIS OWN PARTY, THE </p><p>OPPOSITION MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE HAS BEEN SLOW </p><p>OR UNABLE TO FORMULATE A CATCHY POSITION TO COUNTER THE </p><p>PRESIDENT\'S DOMINANCE ON THE LAND DEBATE.  MEANWHILE, </p><p>THE JUGGERNAUT ROLLS ON.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) POLITICAL, NOT ECONOMIC, LOGIC PREVAILS ON THE </p><p>LAND QUESTION IN ZIMBABWE, AND PRESIDENT MUGABE IS WELL </p><p>DOWN THE PATH OF A CRUSADE.  HE HAS SERVED NOTICE THAT </p><p>HIS BOTTOM LINE IS THAT HE IS DETERMINED TO SECURE HIS </p><p>PLACE IN HISTORY AS THE BLACK ZIMBABWEAN WHO BROUGHT </p><p>LAND BACK TO HIS PEOPLE AND FOUGHT IMPERIALISM.  HE SEES </p><p>HIMSELF AS PROUD AND ALONE; THE FIDEL CASTRO OF SOUTHERN </p><p>AFRICA. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) MUGABE THINKS THAT THE LAND REFORM PROCESS CAN </p><p>BE DE-LINKED FROM THE ECONOMY.  WE BELIEVE HE IS GRAVELY </p><p>WRONG IN THIS ASSESSMENT.  MOREOVER, HIS RHETORIC OF </p><p>LATE CONFIRMS THAT LAND IS PART AND PARCEL OF HIS </p><p>NEWFOUND NATIONALISM; THAT HE IS FIGHTING THE SECOND WAR </p><p>OF LIBERATION.  WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT HE SOON WILL </p><p>GAZETTE THE 3,000 FARMS HE HAS SAID HIS GOVERNMENT WILL </p><p>FORCIBLY ACQUIRE.  (NOTE: THE ACCELERATED LAND </p><p>RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM IS BEING CARRIED OUT BY THE NEWLY- </p><p>FORMED "ZIMBABWE NATIONAL LAND ACQUISITION COMMITTEE," A </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  04362  01 OF 03  071408Z </p><p>ZANU-PF BODY WITH NO LEGAL AUTHORITY, CHAIRED BY VICE </p><p>PRESIDENT MSIKA, AND BYPASSING CABINET AND PARLIAMENT. </p><p>END NOTE.)  HOWEVER, FOLLOWING THE COMMERCIAL FARMERS </p><p>UNION\'S SUIT CHALLENGING THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE </p><p>USE OF PRESIDENTIAL POWERS, WHICH INFURIATED PRESIDENT </p><p>MUGABE, WE QUESTION WHETHER HE WILL STOP AT 3,000. </p><p>INDEED, MUGABE COULD WELL ORDER SEIZURE OF ALL WHITE- </p><p>OWNED COMMERCIAL FARMS OR AN INVASION OF CFU PRESIDENT </p><p>TIM HENWOOD\'S FARM, OR A RAID ON THE CFU\'S HEADQUARTERS </p><p>OR OTHER BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS OPPOSING THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S DICTATORIAL ACTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) AS WE REPORTED IN REFTEL, THE 3,000 FIGURE DATES </p><p>TO 1997 WHEN A LIST OF COMMERCIAL FARMS WHOSE LAND </p><p>SURFACE TOTALED FIVE MILLION HECTARES WAS DRAWN UP.  IT </p><p>WAS ESTIMATED THAT THE GOVERNMENT WOULD NEED ROUGHLY USD </p><p>THREE BILLION TO ACQUIRE THESE: 80 PERCENT OF THE COST </p><p>WOULD BE FOR IMPROVEMENTS AND 20 PERCENT FOR THE LAND </p><p>ITSELF.  EVEN IF THE ZIMBABWEAN GOVERNMENT WERE TO </p><p>STRONG-ARM THE JUDICIARY TO REDUCE THE MARKET VALUE OF </p><p>THESE FARMS TO, SAY, USD ONE BILLION, IT STILL WOULD </p><p>HAVE TO COME UP WITH USD 250 MILLION (WHICH IT DOES NOT </p><p>HAVE) UP FRONT TO COMPENSATE THE CURRENT OWNERS UNDER </p><p>PRESENT REGULATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ5314 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  04362  02 OF 03  071408Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00  COME-00 </p><p>      CTME-00  INL-00   DODE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00 </p><p>      EUR-00   EXIM-01  E-00     FAAE-00  VC-00    FRB-00   H-01 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   ITC-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    DCP-01 </p><p>      NSAE-00  OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00 </p><p>      P-00     SP-00    IRM-00   SSO-00   STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00 </p><p>      PMB-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /010W </p><p>                  ------------------770207  071408Z /38 </p><p>O 071402Z AUG 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 6779 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 HARARE 004362 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>PASS USTR FOR ROSA WHITAKER </p><p> </p><p>PASS USAID FOR A/AID - RMCCALL AND AFR/SA - TPARK AND </p><p>CREINTSMA </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  04362  02 OF 03  071408Z </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/04/10 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, EAGR, ECON, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: WITH MUGABE IN CRUSADE MODE, THE STATE\'S FUTURE </p><p>ECONOMIC SURVIVAL DROPS OUT OF THE LAND EQUATION </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) THE FIVE MILLION HECTARE FIGURE WAS INTENDED FOR </p><p>RESETTLEMENT OF 500,000 LANDLESS FAMILIES.  WE POINT OUT </p><p>THAT IT IS ESTIMATED THAT THE DIRECT HIRE WORKFORCE OF </p><p>ALL THE COMMERCIAL FARMS TOTALS NEARLY ONE MILLION </p><p>(THOUGH MANY MORE, SPOUSES, CHILDREN AND OTHER </p><p>DEPENDENTS, FOR EXAMPLE, ARE SUPPORTED BY THE COMMERCIAL </p><p>FARM WORKERS).  THE 3,000 FARMS COMPRISING THE 5 MILLION </p><p>HECTARES CONSTITUTES ABOUT 60 PERCENT OF THE COMMERCIAL </p><p>FARM TOTAL.  IF THE FARMS ARE SEIZED ABOUT HALF A </p><p>MILLION FARM WORKERS (50 PERCENT OF 1,000,000) WILL FIND </p><p>THEMSELVES WITHOUT A JOB OR INCOME, AND BOOTED OUT OF </p><p>THEIR QUARTERS.  AS CURRENTLY PLANNED, THE RESETTLED </p><p>PORTION OF THE POPULACE WILL EQUAL THE NEWLY DISPLACED </p><p>AND UNEMPLOYED PORTION, AND THE CURRENTLY PRODUCTIVE </p><p>LAND WILL REVERT TO SUBSISTENCE FARMING WITH ALL THE </p><p>ATTENDANT DISASTROUS ECOLOGICAL AND RESOURCE-DESTROYING </p><p>CONSEQUENCES.  IN SIX TO TEN YEARS THE RESETTLED FARMS </p><p>COULD LOOK LIKE THE COMMUNAL LANDS ALLOCATED IN THE </p><p>1980\'S BY GOVERNMENT - WITHOUT FARM INFRASTRUCTURE LIKE </p><p>IRRIGATION AND NOW ARID, TREELESS, ERODED AND LACKING </p><p>ROADS, ELECTRICITY, SCHOOLS AND SOCIAL SERVICES. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) DURING EARLIER RESETTLEMENT EFFORTS BY THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT, IT TOOK 20 YEARS TO MOVE HALF THE CURRENT </p><p>TARGET OF 500,000 WITH RESULTANT SERIOUS AGRICULTURAL </p><p>EXTENSION AND VIABILITY PROBLEMS.  MOST OF THOSE WHO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  04362  02 OF 03  071408Z </p><p>WERE RESETTLED WERE NOT GIVEN TITLE AND ARE ON LAND THAT </p><p>IS CURRENTLY IDLE DUE TO DEGRADATION.  IT IS IN THE </p><p>REALM OF FANTASY TO IMAGINE THAT THE ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT WILL MANAGE TO RESETTLE 500,000 PEOPLE IN </p><p>ANYTHING BUT A STATE-ORCHESTRATED ROUT IN ONE MONTH. </p><p>THE INTERNAL DISPLACEMENT OF AT LEAST ONE MILLION PEOPLE </p><p>IN THAT TIMEFRAME WOULD SPELL A DISASTER, INCLUDING ANY </p><p>HOPE OF MAINTAINING FOOD SECURITY, THAT WOULD ECLIPSE </p><p>SUCH ILL-STARRED EXPERIMENTS AS SAMORA MACHEL\'S "ALDEIAS </p><p>COMUNAIS." </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) PRESIDENT MUGABE, HOWEVER, DOES NOT ANALYZE OR </p><p>EVEN VIEW THE ISSUE IN THESE TERMS.  HIS TECHNICIANS, </p><p>OUT OF FEAR, TRY TO RATIONALIZE WHAT IS EVIDENTLY </p><p>IRRATIONAL THINKING.  THESE INDIVIDUALS ALSO HARBOR THE </p><p>ILLUSION THAT NO MATTER WHAT, THE DONORS WILL HAVE TO </p><p>COME TO ZIMBABWE\'S ASSISTANCE ON THE GOVERNMENT\'S OWN </p><p>TERMS.  HOWEVER, THE PRESIDENT HAS DECIDED THAT THIS </p><p>CAUSE WILL HELP HIS PARTY WIN THE 2002 PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>ELECTIONS.  WHILE FINANCE MINISTER SIMBA MAKONI WAS IN </p><p>PARLIAMENT ON AUGUST 3 INTRODUCING A FRAMEWORK TO TRY TO </p><p>RESCUE THE ECONOMY, PRESIDENT MUGABE WAS IN BINDURA </p><p>ADDRESSING THE ZIMBABWEAN FARMERS UNION CONFERENCE, </p><p>DEFIANTLY INSULTING THE DONORS IN SHONA.  SUCH </p><p>CONTRADICTIONS MAKE SENSE UNDER POLITICAL LOGIC, AND </p><p>CONSEQUENTLY SOME FORWARD THINKING DONORS ARE MAKING </p><p>CONTINGENCY PLANS NOT FOR LAND REFORM FINANCE, BUT FOR A </p><p>HUMANITARIAN EMERGENCY. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN HOW MUCH MORE OF THIS </p><p>ZANU-PF CAN TAKE.  THE PRESIDENT PUBLICLY CONTRADICTS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  04362  02 OF 03  071408Z </p><p>KEY SENIOR GOVERNMENT FIGURES, SUCH AS HOME AFFAIRS </p><p>MINISTER JOHN NKOMO.  HE PLACES VICE PRESIDENT JOSEPH </p><p>MSIKA IN CHARGE OF THE LAND REFORM PROGRAM, BUT TELLS </p><p>WAR VETERANS LEADER CHENJERAI HITLER HUNZVI TO IGNORE </p><p>THE VICE PRESIDENT.  THE RULING PARTY\'S RELATIONSHIP </p><p>WITH MATEBELELAND IS AT ITS MOST FRAGILE SINCE </p><p>INDEPENDENCE, AND KEEPING JOSEPH MSIKA ON THE TEAM IS </p><p>THE ONLY WAY TO PROP UP THE UNITY ACCORD THAT FUSED </p><p>JOSHUA NKOMO\'S ZAPU-PF WITH MUGABE\'S ZANU. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) THE OPPOSITION MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE TO </p><p>DATE HAS BEEN UNABLE TO THWART THE PRESIDENT\'S LAND </p><p>CAMPAIGN THAT IS BACKED UP BY THE FULL MACHINERY OF THE </p><p>PARTY AND THE GOVERNMENT.  INDEED, MUGABE HONED-IN ON </p><p>THE OPPOSITION\'S WEAKNESS: LACK OF CLARITY IN THE </p><p>POPULAR PERCEPTION ON WHERE IT STANDS ON THE LAND. </p><p>MOREOVER, THE MDC AND ITS TRADE UNION ALLIES HAVE BEEN </p><p>EMBARRASSINGLY CAST AS BEDFELLOWS OF THE WHITE </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARMERS.  ITS LEADERSHIP HAS BEEN UNABLE TO </p><p>SHAKE THE IMAGE OF SELLOUTS TO THE WHITES, A PERCEPTION </p><p>THAT MAY BE GAINING CURRENCY.  THE ONE-DAY STAYAWAY, </p><p>WHICH ZCTU ENDORSED AND ABBREVIATED ON THE EVE OF ITS </p><p>TAKING PLACE, WAS NOT A RESOUNDING SUCCESS.  ITS </p><p>OWNERSHIP WAS UNCLEAR, THERE WAS LITTLE PUBLIC DEBATE </p><p>AROUND IT, AND THE CONNECTION BETWEEN ENDS AND MEANS WAS </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ5318 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  04362  03 OF 03  071408Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00  COME-00 </p><p>      CTME-00  DODE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00 </p><p>      EXIM-01  E-00     FAAE-00  VC-00    FRB-00   H-01     TEDE-00 </p><p>      INR-00   ITC-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  OMB-01 </p><p>      OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00 </p><p>      IRM-00   SSO-00   STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  R-00     PMB-00 </p><p>      DSCC-00  DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /009W </p><p>                  ------------------770220  071408Z /38 </p><p>O 071402Z AUG 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 6780 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 HARARE 004362 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>PASS USTR FOR ROSA WHITAKER </p><p> </p><p>PASS USAID FOR A/AID - RMCCALL AND AFR/SA - TPARK AND </p><p>CREINTSMA </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  04362  03 OF 03  071408Z </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/04/10 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, EAGR, ECON, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: WITH MUGABE IN CRUSADE MODE, THE STATE\'S FUTURE </p><p>ECONOMIC SURVIVAL DROPS OUT OF THE LAND EQUATION </p><p> </p><p>VAGUE.  INDEED, WE UNDERSTAND THAT ZCTU WAS DIVIDED ON </p><p>THE STRIKE, NOT BECAUSE ANYONE IN IT IS PRO-MUGABE, BUT </p><p>BECAUSE THEY ARE UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THE LINK TO THE </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARMERS. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) THE LAND ACQUISITION ACT, AMENDED BY </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL DECREE, WILL BE TABLED IN PARLIAMENT FOR </p><p>RATIFICATION.  ZANU-PF LIKELY WILL WIN, AS IT ONLY TAKES </p><p>A SIMPLE MAJORITY TO DO SO.  IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN WHAT </p><p>THE MDC\'S POSITION WILL BE AT THAT TIME ON LAND.  AT </p><p>THIS WRITING, THE ONLY WAY FOR IT TO TURN THE TABLES </p><p>WOULD BE TO MOVE MASSIVELY TOWARD THE RURAL AREAS.  FOR </p><p>THE MOMENT THE MDC APPEARS TO BE CONCENTRATING ON ITS </p><p>URBAN BASE, COMMUNICATING THROUGH ITS PARTISAN </p><p>NEWSPAPER, "THE DAILY NEWS".  ALTHOUGH RULE OF LAW IS </p><p>THE MDC\'S NUMBER ONE ISSUE, IT HAS ABDICATED THE </p><p>POLITICAL STRATEGIC INITIATIVE IN THE RURAL AREAS TO </p><p>ZANU-PF AND THE WAR VETERANS. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) CONFIRMING OUR PERCEPTION THAT ZANU IS IN </p><p>CAMPAIGN MODE IS THE FACT THAT THE JULY 20 ZANU-PF </p><p>CENTRAL COMMITTEE MEETING WAS ABOUT THE PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>ELECTION, AND HOW TO GET THINGS RIGHT FOR IT.  THE BODY </p><p>DISCUSSED THE ECONOMY AND LAND, BUT DID NOT CONDUCT A </p><p>POSTMORTEM ON THE PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS.

SOME HERE </p><p>THINK THAT IF MUGABE VIEWS HIMSELF AS SUCCESSFUL ON THE </p><p>LAND ISSUE, HE WILL BE SATISFIED AND NOT PRESENT HIMSELF </p><p>AS A CANDIDATE, AND, LOOK INSTEAD FOR A WAY TO RETIRE </p><p>WITH HONOR AND ACCLAMATION.  WE WORRY THAT THAT MAY BE </p><p>WISHFUL THINKING. </p><p> </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
