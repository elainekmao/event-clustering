REASON:  1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>------ </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) In a September 12 meeting with the Ambassador and UK </p><p>Ambassador Keith Bloomfield, Prime Minister Sher Bahadur </p><p>Deuba seemed clearly distressed by rumors that King Gyanendra </p><p>wants to postpone the November 13 national elections, "seize </p><p>power" by invoking Clause 127 of the Constitution, and </p><p>substitute "his own man" for Deuba as head of government.  He </p><p>reiterated several times that he feels his personal </p><p>credibility is linked to the elections going forward as </p><p>scheduled and asked both Ambassadors to send a "strong </p><p>signal" to the Palace to allow polling to proceed.  He </p><p>indicated he will re-impose the state of emergency </p><p>selectively in certain areas after a meeting with leaders of </p><p>the major political parties.  A September 11 press release </p><p>from Maoist supremo Prachanda (septel) offering a ceasefire </p><p>he dismissed as a ploy, but noted he had sent discreet </p><p>feelers through an intermediary about the possibility of </p><p>resuming dialogue.  The Army Chief told the UK Ambassador </p><p>September 12 that recent Maoist successes have made the Army </p><p>question its ability to provide adequate security for the </p><p>elections.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>PALACE PLOY? </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) In a September 12 meeting with the Ambassador and </p><p>with UK Ambassador Keith Bloomfield, Prime Minister Sher </p><p>Bahadur Deuba admitted to "some suspicion that the Palace </p><p>doesn\'t want elections" (Ref A).  Although the PM said that </p><p>King Gyanendra has told him nothing directly, well-connected </p><p>Palace emissaries have let it be known that the King wants </p><p>elections postponed and wants Deuba to step down, to be </p><p>replaced by "his own man"--Deuba said he had heard former </p><p>Panchayat-era PM Kirti Nidhi Bista suggested-- as head of an </p><p>interim government for two years.  Deuba said he has rebuffed </p><p>the suggestion to postpone polling, stressing his position </p><p>that the Government of Nepal (GON) should proceed with </p><p>preparations to hold national elections on November 13. </p><p>"Let\'s try first" before deciding that elections cannot be </p><p>held, he stressed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Amb. Bloomfield asked which government body has the </p><p>authority to determine that elections should be postponed. </p><p>Deuba responded that the Cabinet can recommend postponement, </p><p>but such a decision would require his assent as Prime </p><p>Minister.  Nonetheless, Deuba added gloomily, the King is </p><p>rumored to be saying if the (security) situation does not </p><p>improve, "he has to seize power" by invoking Clause 127 of </p><p>the Constitution (Ref A).  "He\'s very much impatient to have </p><p>some sort of role."  The King is "very clever," Deuba said. </p><p>He is "creating perceptions" that the elections cannot be </p><p>held in order to provoke a Constitutional crisis.  The King </p><p>might then blame Deuba for having asked him to dissolve </p><p>Parliament and call for elections.  But "the King cannot </p><p>force me to resign," he declared, although he later indicated </p><p>he would personally feel compelled to resign if he were </p><p>unable to hold elections as promised. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Both Ambassadors attempted to press Deuba on whether </p><p>he would participate in an interim Cabinet, should a </p><p>determination be made that elections cannot be held.  Deuba </p><p>was reluctant to accept even the hypothetical suggestion that </p><p>elections be postponed, emphasizing that he believes his </p><p>personal credibility is firmly linked to holding to the </p><p>election schedule.  At another point in the conversation, </p><p>however, he said he would be ready to take part in an </p><p>all-party Cabinet--possibly also including technocrats.  He </p><p>asked both Ambassadors to send a "strong signal" to the </p><p>Palace that elections should go forward as scheduled. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>SELECTIVE STATE OF EMERGENCY AN OPTION </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Deuba said he plans to call an all-party meeting once </p><p>the Election Commission announces its long-pending decision </p><p>on which Nepali Congress faction may use the party symbol </p><p>during elections.  (Note:  This decision is expected soon. </p><p>End note.)  Deuba said he will raise re-imposition of the </p><p>state of emergency, which expired August 28, in the meeting, </p><p>adding that the other parties are sure to oppose the </p><p>emergency.  (Note:  Nepali press on September 12 quoted the </p><p>State Minister for Home Affairs as asserting the emergency </p><p>will be re-imposed, regardless of the outcome of the </p><p>all-party meeting.  End note.)  Deuba indicated he will use </p><p>the parties\' objections to the emergency to re-impose it on a </p><p>selective basis, applying it only in those areas most </p><p>affected by the insurgency.  When elections are to be held in </p><p>those areas, the emergency could be lifted.  Controls on the </p><p>press would have to be lifted if the emergency is applied </p><p>only to certain parts of the country, Deuba acknowledged; </p><p>"only the movement of the people would be suppressed." </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>PROSPECTS FOR DIALOGUE </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Ambassador Malinowski raised the September 11 press </p><p>release from Maoist supremo Prachanda offering a ceasefire </p><p>(septel).  The Prime Minister dismissed the offer as a </p><p>typically insincere ploy by the insurgents.  If, however, the </p><p>offer could be determined to be genuine, the door would be </p><p>open for secret talks.  He said he had sent out feelers </p><p>through a purported Maoist emissary to "discreet talks."  The </p><p>Maoists are supposed to be holding an important meeting next </p><p>week, after which the PM has been told to expect a reply. </p><p>The PM said he emphasized in his message to the insurgents </p><p>that at the very least they suspend violent activities during </p><p>the elections.  Otherwise, if violence disrupts the elections </p><p>and they cannot be held, he concluded, "my credibility will </p><p>be damaged." </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  The problem is, Deuba noted, he can never be sure of </p><p>the credentials of the supposed Maoist emissaries who contact </p><p>him, or with what authority they may speak for the </p><p>leadership.  Although there are many would-be mediators, "I </p><p>don\'t know who the real person is."  Because of the Maoists\' </p><p>anti-royal rhetoric, the King himself "is not very keen" on </p><p>brokering talks with the Maoists, Deuba said, but noted in </p><p>the same breath rumors that had surfaced in the past linking </p><p>the Maoists to India and the Palace. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>CABINET CLEANING </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Ambassador Malinowski asked if the PM were </p><p>considering changes in his Cabinet (Ref B).  The PM replied </p><p>that he is deferring that decision--like the decision about </p><p>restoring the emergency--until after the Election Commission </p><p>makes a determination about his party\'s election symbol. </p><p>Deuba acknowledged that the King had earlier urged him to </p><p>pare down his Cabinet, but noted that various factors, like </p><p>having to await the Supreme Court\'s decision on the </p><p>dissolution of Parliament (Ref D), had made him defer action. </p><p> Deuba said that he would dismiss some of his ministers </p><p>accused of corruption.  Ambassador Malinowski said that some </p><p>of those were among the most politically powerful figures in </p><p>his party and asked what they might do in retaliation.  Deuba </p><p>noted ruefully that he expected them to cause difficulties </p><p>for him. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>ELECTION SCHEDULE </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  Deuba cited "strong rumors" circulating now that the </p><p>Royal Nepal Army (RNA) does not support holding the </p><p>elections.  Elections could be held "phase-wise" to allay </p><p>security concerns, in up to six phases beginning in the </p><p>Himalayan region, he suggested.  This schedule might not be </p><p>completed before February, he acknowledged.  He asked both </p><p>the U.S. and UK to send international observers to oversee </p><p>the elections.  Amb. Bloomfield replied that the EU is </p><p>deciding September 12 whether or not to send an observer </p><p>mission. </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>NEW ARMY CHIEF QUESTIONS ELECTIONS </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) Chief of Army Staff Gen. Pyar Jung Thapa, who </p><p>assumed his position September 9, told the British Ambassador </p><p>September 12 that recent Maoist successes in the field (Ref </p><p>C) have made the RNA leadership question its ability to </p><p>provide adequate security for the electons.  That the Maoists </p><p>were able to assemble the forces necessary to attack in two </p><p>different parts of the country--including a district </p><p>headquarters--without detection has changed the thinking of </p><p>both the RNA and the Election Commission, Thapa said.  Before </p><p>people had thought the elections could be held in 2-5 phases; </p><p>now it looks like 7-8 discrete phases may be necessary.  The </p><p>RNA does not want to be discredited by a botched election, </p><p>the Army Chief noted.  But "no one wants to grasp the nettle" </p><p>and say out loud that elections cannot be held; neither the </p><p>RNA nor the Election Commission feels in a position to do so. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C)  Despite Deuba\'s assertions that the King can force </p><p>him neither to resign nor to postpone elections, the PM is </p><p>clearly rattled by mounting reports that the Palace is </p><p>preparing to make a move.  Clause 127 does not stipulate that </p><p>the King must seek the PM\'s approval before taking action. </p><p>Rather, orders issued by the King under the Clause "shall be </p><p>laid before Parliament"--which, in the absence of the Lower </p><p>House, translates to the Upper House of Parliament, many of </p><p>whose members are appointed by the King.  It is interesting </p><p>that the PM did not allege, as have some other political </p><p>players over the past few days, that the King\'s prospective </p><p>actions represent a threat to democracy.  Instead, he </p><p>obviously sees the threat in much more personal terms. </p><p>Postponing the elections for him means undermining his </p><p>credility as a leader and thus his longevity as a politician. </p><p> But without similar enthusiasm for elections from other key </p><p>players--the Election Commission, the RNA, and most </p><p>important, other party leaders who may see an opportunity in </p><p>Deuba\'s  demise--it is unclear that the Prime Minister alone </p><p>can withstand what may be the beginning of a full-court </p><p>Palace press. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
