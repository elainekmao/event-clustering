<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 FRANKFURT 005668 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINR, PREL, ECON, ELAB, GM </p><p>SUBJECT: SAARLAND\'S POPULAR MINISTER-PRESIDENT PETER </p><p>MUELLER: A CENTER-LEFT "REBEL" </p><p> </p><p>REFTEL: 2002 FRANKFURT 11411 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary: Saarland Minister-President Peter Mueller </p><p>represents the center-left membership of the Christian </p><p>Democratic Union (CDU).  Known for his unorthodox, </p><p>provocative political style, he one of the most outspoken </p><p>CDU Minister-Presidents.  He faces state elections in summer </p><p>2004 and currently has the lead in opinion polls.  Mueller </p><p>plans to visit the U.S. in September 2003 and seeks to </p><p>expand U.S. investment in Saarland.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>Unorthodox Conservative </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Saarland Minister-President Peter Mueller broke the </p><p>15-year reign of the Social Democratic Party (SPD) in </p><p>Saarland in 1999 by winning an absolute majority for the </p><p>CDU.  He was re-elected Saarland CDU state chairman in May </p><p>2003 with 99.5 percent of the vote and has become the most </p><p>popular Saarland politician since Oskar Lafontaine (the </p><p>former Minister-President and SPD national chairman who left </p><p>office in 1999).  Mueller is outspoken and likes putting </p><p>forth unconventional ideas.  Though he represents a small </p><p>state (population one million), he is one of the most vocal </p><p>of the CDU Minister-Presidents.  He has several nicknames </p><p>including "black Peter" (a reference to a card game that </p><p>indicates "the one who gets all the blame.")  This stems </p><p>from 1998, when Mueller was the first to call for Chancellor </p><p>Kohl\'s resignation and was accused of being disloyal, though </p><p>many in the party privately shared the same viewpoint. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) One of Mueller\'s closest aides, Joachim </p><p>Kiefaber, is the head of the Foreign Trade Division in </p><p>the Ministry of Economics and a former Free Democratic </p><p>Party (FDP) caucus member of the Saarland parliament, a </p><p>holdover from the former CDU-FDP coalition.  He </p><p>describes Mueller as religious and socially minded, </p><p>noting Mueller\'s Social Democratic family and </p><p>upbringing, often reflected in his left-of-center CDU </p><p>policies.  On economic policy, Mueller is a vigorous </p><p>advocate of new technologies and has pushed strongly for </p><p>structural change in the steel and coal industry in </p><p>Saarland.  Another area which interests Mueller is </p><p>social reform and the Herzog Kommission, the CDU </p><p>counterpart to the Ruerup commission.  Mueller tends to </p><p>be a mediator.  This is reflected in his cabinet, with </p><p>its healthy mix of conservatives and centrists.  His </p><p>bridge-building skills are reflected in the opinion </p><p>polls: 70 percent of Saarland\'s voters respect Mueller </p><p>as a leader. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Mueller was a judge with an outstanding </p><p>reputation before entering politics.  On legal issues, </p><p>Mueller is considered one of Germany\'s brightest minds. </p><p>Mueller does not back away from criticizing his own </p><p>party.  In 1991 for example, he publicly demanded that </p><p>Chancellor Kohl step down because of a broken promise on </p><p>taxes.  In 2002, Mueller admitted that the CDU\'s outrage </p><p>in the Bundesrat after the immigration bill vote that </p><p>approved the law (but which was ultimately overturned by </p><p>the Federal Constitutional Court) was staged.  The press </p><p>speculated as to why he "unmasked" his CDU colleagues, </p><p>particularly Hesse Minister-President Roland Koch.  His </p><p>staff told us that Mueller\'s decision reflected both his </p><p>satiric humor and general frustration with political </p><p>gamesmanship on the immigration issue, which he feels </p><p>strongly about.  Mueller\'s own views on immigration </p><p>reform are, in fact, not far distant from many of the </p><p>points in the government\'s proposals. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Mueller\'s unorthodox style is reflected in his </p><p>dislike of hierarchy.  He is often seen in the corridors of </p><p>the Chancellery visiting his staff, in contrast to his two </p><p>more formal predecessors.  Many on Mueller\'s team come from </p><p>the CDU\'s youth wing.  He was the first Minister-President </p><p>to introduce paperless cabinet meetings.  Everyone in his </p><p>cabinet must take computer training and carries a laptop. </p><p>In decision making, Mueller likes the motto, "exactness </p><p>before quickness."  Despite this, contacts say that he tends </p><p>to change his opinion suddenly. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Mueller became a national figure when he assumed </p><p>chairmanship of the CDU immigration commission in 2000.  He </p><p>had a personal and legal interest in the subject, not least </p><p>due to the fact that Saarland shares borders with France and </p><p>Luxembourg.  He essentially agreed with Interior Minister </p><p>Otto Schily on a draft immigration bill.  Mueller blames the </p><p>Green Party for blocking a compromise, but FDP contacts </p><p>close to Mueller say that he was under enormous pressure by </p><p>the CDU presidium and finally caved in.  Mueller\'s aide </p><p>Kiefaber said, "With his backing down on the immigration </p><p>issue, Mueller made one change of direction too many. </p><p>Another will cause him lost credibility and thus diminish </p><p>his influence in the national CDU."  Mueller\'s close </p><p>relationship with CDU Chairperson Angela Merkel was also </p><p>seriously damaged by his backing of Stoiber.  Mueller said </p><p>that he had had a one-on-one meeting with Merkel beforehand </p><p>to explain his reasoning, but Merkel leaked it to the press, </p><p>making him appear disloyal.  Since then, the relationship </p><p>has been cool. </p><p> </p><p>Pro-American, Friend of France, Seeks to Expand U.S. </p><p>Investment in Saarland </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) Mueller has a strong interest in foreign policy. </p><p>This year he became representative in the Bundesrat for </p><p>German-French cultural affairs, an important political </p><p>position based on the Elysee Treaty.  A good relationship </p><p>with France is the cornerstone of Mueller\'s foreign policy. </p><p>Mueller also seeks closer contact with neighbors Luxembourg </p><p>and Belgium.  Mueller is generally pro-American, but on the </p><p>Iraq issue he sympathized with the French position and </p><p>criticized the U.S. for allegedly disregarding international </p><p>law.  Mueller hopes to expand Saarland-U.S. relations and </p><p>U.S. investment in Saarland and will visit the U.S. </p><p>(Washington D.C. and Pennsylvania) in September 2003. </p><p> </p><p>Facing State Elections in Summer 2004 </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) Mueller faces his first test at the polling booth </p><p>as Minister-President in summer 2004.  Despite a clear lead </p><p>in the opinion polls (the CDU has between 48 and 50 percent) </p><p>the SPD has a realistic chance to win back Saarland for the </p><p>SPD, especially if the Green Party makes it over the five </p><p>percent threshold into state parliament.  If the SPD gains </p><p>in strength sufficiently to win back the reins of power, the </p><p>composition of the Bundesrat, Germany\'s second house of </p><p>parliament would change (although not significantly enough </p><p>to overturn the current CDU/CSU-FDP majority).  Mueller and </p><p>his staff do not believe that Oskar Lafontaine will run for </p><p>office in Saarland again.  Mueller\'s assistant Rabel said: </p><p>"Election campaigning is hard work.  Lafontaine is not up </p><p>for it."  Mueller will campaign with the themes of </p><p>Saarland\'s success: high growth, low unemployment, effective </p><p>restructuring of the steel industry.  The opposition will </p><p>point to Saarland\'s large deficit and the fact that much of </p><p>the reduction in unemployment can be attributed to </p><p>demographic factors. </p><p> </p><p>Other Biographic Information </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) Born l955 in Illingen, Saarland, Peter Mueller </p><p>studied law and political science and was appointed </p><p>judge at the Saarbruecken State Court in 1986.  In l990, </p><p>he was elected into the Saarbruecken State Parliament </p><p>(Landtag) and served as the CDU caucus\' parliamentary </p><p>manager until l994.  Mueller went to the U.S. on an </p><p>International Visitor Program in 1992.  He became </p><p>Saarland CDU party chairman in the summer of l995, </p><p>succeeding former National Minister Klaus Toepfer, his </p><p>mentor.  In September 1999, he was elected Minister- </p><p>President, winning unexpectedly by a small margin.  (Due </p><p>to the absence of smaller parties in the Landtag the CDU </p><p>achieved an absolute majority.)  Mueller ended 15 years </p><p>of SPD rule in Saarland, succeeding Minister-President </p><p>Reinhard Klimmt (SPD).  Mueller spoke out early in favor </p><p>of a new immigration law.  In 2000, he took over the </p><p>chairmanship of the CDU immigration commission, a </p><p>position of national prominence. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) Popular Minister-President Mueller seems </p><p>omnipresent in the small state of Saarland: his role as </p><p>"state father" suits him.  Though an academic and a judge, </p><p>he maintains contact with the man in the street.  Mueller </p><p>seeks to make his party "the CSU of Saarland" reaching far </p><p>into the centrist electorate.  The Saarland CDU is indeed </p><p>much more like the CSU in Bavaria, with no natural </p><p>connections to the liberal FDP and a good relationship with </p><p>the trade unions.  If Mueller strengthens the CDU in </p><p>Saarland in the 2004 elections, his position in the national </p><p>CDU will also grow.  Mueller will continue to play an </p><p>important role in CDU and is one of few visibly representing </p><p>its center-left membership.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p>BODDE </p><p></p></div>
