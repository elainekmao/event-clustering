STATE 98591 </p><p>     B. STATE 52550 </p><p> </p><p>1. THIS IS AN ACTION MESSAGE FOR DEPT.; SEE PARA 8.  ESTCOUNS </p><p>MET WITH MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT EU AFFAIRS OFFICERS ON MAY </p><p>30 TO DISCUSS THE EU PROPOSALS FOR TRACEABILITY AND LABELING </p><p>OF GMO EVENTS, AND TO DISCUSS ITALIAN VIEWS TOWARD EU </p><p>CHEMICALS REFORM. </p><p> </p><p>2. FINDING THE RIGHT GOI MINISTRY WITH WHICH TO DISCUSS </p><p>TRACEABILITY AND LABELING WAS A CHALLENGE.  WE WERE REBUFFED </p><p>BY MFA, FOREIGN TRADE, AGRICULTURE, HEALTH AND EU AFFAIRS. </p><p>ALL POINTED US TO THE MINISTRY OF GOVERNMENT (MOG), WHICH HAS </p><p>HANDLED THE ACCOUNT WITHOUT MUCH ENTHUSIASM, MUCH PROFILE, OR </p><p>MUCH ATTENTION BEYOND THE TECHNICAL LEVEL. </p><p> </p><p>3. HEAD OF MOE\'S EU AFFAIRS OFFICE GIULIANA GASPARINI TOLD </p><p>EST COUNS THAT THE GOI HAD NOT TAKEN A CONSOLIDATED POSITION </p><p>ON THE TRACEABILITY AND LABELING PROPOSALS BECAUSE OF THE NOW </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  03390  01 OF 02  101320Z </p><p>FAMILIAR SPLIT BETWEEN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND THE </p><p>MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE.  ACCORDING TO GASPARINI, HEALTH </p><p>OPPOSES BIOTECH TRACEABILITY UNLESS HEALTH ISSUES (POSSIBLE </p><p>ALLERGENS, CHANGED NUTRITIONAL COMPOSITION) ARE INTRODUCED BY </p><p>THE BIOTECH PRODUCT.  SHE SAID AGRICULTURE BELIEVES THAT THE </p><p>PROPOSED TRACEABILITY RULES DO NOT GO FAR ENOUGH (WE KNOW </p><p>THAT MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE ALEMANNO LOBBIED HEAVILY TO EU </p><p>PARLIAMENTARIANS BEFORE THE EP VOTE), AND SHOULD INCLUDE </p><p>TRACEABILITY THROUGH ANIMAL PRODUCTS WHEN BIOTECH FEED IS </p><p>INVOLVED.  THE MINISTRIES AGREE THAT LABELING IS NECESSARY TO </p><p>RESPOND TO CONSUMER DEMANDS. </p><p> </p><p>4. WITHIN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT ITSELF, A SIMILAR SPLIT </p><p>EXISTS.  CONSULTANT SPECIALISTS WITHIN MOE FROM THE FORMER </p><p>AMATO GOVERNMENT ARE WORKING ON TRACEABILITY AND LABELING. </p><p>THESE INCLUDE FORMER GREEN PEACE ANTI-GMO ACTIVISTS WHO SEE </p><p>BURDENSOME AND EXACTING T AND L AS A WAY TO BLOCK GMOS IN </p><p>ITALY AND THE EU, ACCORDING TO GASPARINI.  A MORE MODERATE </p><p>FACTION WITHIN MOE, LED BY DG FOR INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS CLINI </p><p>AND INCLUDING GASPARINI HERSELF, ARE ARGUING FOR REALISTIC </p><p>RULES THAT CAN BE IMPLEMENTED.  GASPARINI EXPLAINED THAT THIS </p><p>WOULD INCLUDE "REASONABLE" THRESHOLDS FOR ADVENTITIOUS </p><p>PRESENCE (AP) (BY WHICH IS MEANT 0.3-0.7 PERCENT FOR FOODS </p><p>AND FEEDS) AND SOME ACCOMMODATION ON BIOTECH PRODUCTS LIKE </p><p>OILS WHICH ARE INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM CONVENTIONAL PRODUCTS </p><p>AFTER PROCESSING.  THE ISSUE OF AP IN SEEDS FOR PLANTING IS </p><p>ESPECIALLY DIFFICULT FOR ITALY BECAUSE THE EU PROPOSALS DO </p><p>NOT SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS SEEDS.  CONSEQUENTLY, THE MINISTRY </p><p>OF AGRICULTURE HAS BEEN ABLE TO ARGUE ITS ZERO THRESHOLD </p><p>PROPOSAL AS A MEMBER STATE\'S RIGHT TO SET STANDARDS AND RULES </p><p>WHERE NONE ARE PROVIDED BY BRUSSELS. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  03390  01 OF 02  101320Z </p><p> </p><p>5. GASPARINI SAID THAT THE MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENT IS MOVING </p><p>CAUTIOUSLY TO FIND A BRIDGE FROM ITALIAN VIEWS THROUGH THE EU </p><p>PROPOSALS TO A MORE "OPEN" APPROACH TO BIOTECHNOLOGY BASED ON </p><p>SCIENCE.  SHE DID NOT EXPECT MUCH CLARIFICATION OF ITALIAN </p><p>POSITIONS IN THE NEAR TERM, NOTING THAT THE SPANISH </p><p>PRESIDENCY HAS DECIDED NOT TO DEAL FURTHER WITH </p><p>BIOTECHNOLOGY, AND THAT THE DANES HAD SET THE FIRST </p><p>ENVIRONMENT COUNCIL MEETING OF THEIR PRESIDENCY FOR </p><p>MID-OCTOBER. </p><p> </p><p>6. COMMENT: THE TRACEABILITY AND LABELING ISSUE IS MAKING ITS </p><p>WAY SLOWLY UPWARD FROM TECHNICIAN-BUREAUCRATS WHO REMAIN </p><p>STEADFASTLY ANTI-BIOTECH.  MOE REPRESENTATIVES AT A RECENT </p><p>MEETING CONVENED BY THE TECHNICAL SECRETARIAT AT THE EU </p><p>AFFAIRS MINISTRY DID NOT CLEAR THEIR VIEWS WITH THE </p><p>MINISTER\'S OR DG\'S OFFICE AND JOINED THE AG MINISTRY ON </p><p>ARGUING THAT THE EU PROPOSALS WERE TOO LIBERAL.  LOWER </p><p>RANKING MOE OFFICIALS ARE RELUCTANT TO SPEAK AGAINST THE </p><p>MEMBER STATE "CONSENSUS" AT TECHNICAL MEETINGS IN BRUSSELS. </p><p>AT THE DIRECTOR GENERAL LEVEL, THERE IS GROWING RECOGNITION </p><p>WITHIN THE MOE THAT A COHERENT POLICY IS REQUIRED FOR THE </p><p>LONG TERM. END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ8772 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  03390  02 OF 02  101320Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AGRE-00  AID-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00  COME-00  CTME-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  ITCE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  EB-00    EXME-00  E-00 </p><p>      FAAE-00  UTED-00  VC-00    FRB-00   HHS-01   H-01     TEDE-00 </p><p>      INR-00   ITC-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  OES-01 </p><p>      OMB-01   OPIC-01  ACE-00   SP-00    SSO-00   SS-00    STR-00 </p><p>      TEST-00  TRSE-00  USIE-00  DRL-02   G-00     SAS-00     /010W </p><p>                  ------------------C92039  101321Z /38 </p><p>R 101327Z JUL 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 4734 </p><p>INFO EU MEMBER STATES COLLECTIVE </p><p>AMCONSUL FLORENCE </p><p>AMCONSUL MILAN </p><p>AMCONSUL NAPLES </p><p>NSC WASHDC </p><p>USDA WASHDC </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 02 ROME 003390 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>EB FOR A/S WAYNE, PDAS DONNELLY, DAS GADSDEN </p><p>EB/TPP/ATT FOR PEREZ </p><p>E FOR SHUB </p><p>EUR/ERA FOR HEN-NIL </p><p>OES FOR A/S TURNER, PDAS ROCK </p><p>STATE PASS USTR FOR STROJE, NOVELLI </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  03390  02 OF 02  101320Z </p><p>STATE PASS USDA FOR APHIS:SMCCAMMON, USDA/FAS:BLUM, </p><p>USDA/FAS/ITT:EJONES, USDA/FAS/OA:SLUTSKY, USDA/FAS/ITP </p><p>MACKEY, RICHIE, AND OS HEGWOOD </p><p>STATE PASS FDA FOR EFLAMM </p><p>NSC FOR EDSON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAGR, ECON, ETRD, EU </p><p>SUBJECT: ITALY SPLIT ON BIOTECH TRACEABILITY AND LABELING, </p><p>STILL THINKING ABOUT EU CHEMICALS REFORM </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>EU CHEMICALS REFORM ON THE SLOW TRACK </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.

WHEN REMINDED ABOUT U.S. VIEWS (REF B), SUBINI SAID </p><p>HE UNDERSTOOD OUR CONCERNS ABOUT COSTS, SINCE THESE WERE THE </p><p>CONCERNS OF SMALL- AND MEDIUM-SIZED BUSINESSES IN ITALY.  HE </p><p>ADMITTED THAT HE HAD YET TO BEGIN DISCUSSIONS WITH ITALIAN </p><p>INDUSTRY, THOUGH HE PLANS TO DO SO IN THE NEAR FUTURE.  HE </p><p>ALSO SAID THAT HE DID NOT BELIEVE THE TECHNICAL DISCUSSIONS </p><p>WERE PROCEEDING VERY QUICKLY FROM THE CONCEPTUAL PROBLEM OF </p><p>MANAGING 100,000 CHEMICALS FROM THE "POLLUTER PAYS" PRINCIPLE </p><p>TO PRACTICAL WORK. </p><p> </p><p>8. COMMENT AND ACTION REQUEST: THE SIZE AND ECONOMIC </p><p>IMPORTANCE OF ITALY\'S CHEMICAL INDUSTRY (WITH A U.S. </p><p>INVESTMENT OF USD 2.3 BILLION), AND THE LACK OF SIGNIFICANT </p><p>OUTREACH BY MOE, MAY CREATE AN OPPORTUNITY.
