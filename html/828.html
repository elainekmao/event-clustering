<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 RIYADH 002406 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR TUELLER; PARIS FOR ALLEGRONE </p><p> </p><p>E.O.12958: DECL:  06/19/06 </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, PGOV, PINR, SA </p><p>SUBJECT:  CROWN PRINCE ABDULLAH THE DIPLOMAT </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) CLASSIFIED BY CDA THEODORE KATTOUF, REASON 1.5.D. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) SUMMARY:  GIVEN KING FAHD\'S UNCERTAIN HEALTH, </p><p>CROWN PRINCE ABDULLAH APPEARS TO HAVE MOVED INTO THE </p><p>ROLE OF REPRESENTING SAUDI ARABIA\'S FACE TO THE OUTSIDE </p><p>WORLD.  WHILE DRAMATIC CHANGES ARE NOT THE HALLMARK OF </p><p>SAUDI GOVERNANCE, ABDULLAH WILL NO DOUBT PUT HIS OWN </p><p>IMPRIMATUR ON SAUDI DIPLOMACY.  HE IS, FOR EXAMPLE, </p><p>ATTUNED TO LOCAL POLITICS AND WILL VIEW SAG\'S OVERSEAS </p><p>COMMITMENTS FROM THE OPTIC OF THE EFFECT THAY WILL HAVE </p><p>ON DOMESTIC PRIORITIES.  ALTHOUGH THE CROWN PRINCE HAS </p><p>REPEATEDLY STRESSED HIS COMMITMENT TO CLOSE BILATERAL </p><p>TIES WITH THE U.S., HE HAS SPOKEN FORCEFULLY OF THE NEED </p><p>FOR A JUST PEACE FOR THE PALESTINIANS AND SYRIANS.  WE </p><p>EXPECT ABDULLAH TO BE ACTIVE IN SHAPING AN ARAB </p><p>CONSENSUS THAT KEEPS THE PEACE PROCESS ALIVE, WHILE </p><p>MAINTAINING THE APPEARANCE OF ARAB UNITY AND RESOLVE. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>ABDULLAH\'S DIPLOMATIC PROFILE </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) CROWN PRINCE ABDULLAH BIN ABD AL-AZIZ, LED THE </p><p>SAUDI DELEGATION TO THE JUNE 7-8 TRIPARTITE SUMMIT IN </p><p>DAMASCUS.  ABDULLAH WILL REPRESENT SAUDI ARABIA AT THE </p><p>JUNE 22 SUMMIT IN CAIRO AND PERHAPS ALL FUTURE ARAB </p><p>SUMMITRY. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) ALTHOUGH IT IS CLEAR THAT HE STILL MUST BE </p><p>CONSULTED ON KEY DECISIONS, PARTICULARLY ON FOREIGN </p><p>POLICY MATTERS, KING FAHD\'S INVOLVEMENT IN DAY-TO-DAY </p><p>AFFAIRS OF STATE REMAINS SPORADIC.  RECENTLY, THE KING </p><p>RECEIVED SULTAN QABUS, AND THE KUWAITI AND BAHRAINI </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTERS IN JEDDAH.  HE ALSO MET IN MECCA THE </p><p>HEADS OF STATE AND GOVERNMENTS LEADING THEIR HAJJ </p><p>DELEGATIONS.  EVEN EARLIER IN THE YEAR, HE HAD A SHORT </p><p>MEETING WITH FORMER PRESIDENT BUSH.  THE MEDIA REPORT </p><p>THE KING PRESIDING OVER MEETINGS OF THE COUNCIL OF </p><p>MINISTERS THAT ISSUE STATEMENTS SPELLING OUT THE SAG\'S </p><p>POSITION ON FOREIGN POLICY ISSUES.  NEVERTHELESS, ALL </p><p>AVAILABLE EVIDENCE INDICATS THAT THESE ENCOUNTERS ARE </p><p>TIGHTLY CONTROLLED AFAIRS AND LARGELY PROTOCOLARY IN </p><p>CHARACTER. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) WHILE EFFORTS PERSIST TO FUDGE THE ISSUE OF THE </p><p>KING\'S PRESENCE AT THE HELM OF STATE, THE CURRENT RUSH </p><p>OF ARAB AND PEACE PROCESS POLITICS IS INCREASINGLY </p><p>FORCING THE AL SAUD TO PERMIT THE HEIR APPARENT TO </p><p>PROJECT THEIR TOP LEADERSHIP.  INDEED, ABDULLAH HAS </p><p>STEPPED IN WHERE A SUBSTANTIVE OFFICIAL SAUDI PRESENCE </p><p>IS REQUIRED.  THUS, THE CROWN PRINCE ATTENDED THE GCC </p><p>SUMMIT IN MUSCAT LAST DECEMBER AND THE RECENT DAMASCUS </p><p>TRIPARTITE SUMMIT.  ON THE OTHER HAND, FOREIGN MINISTER </p><p>PRINCE SAUD AL-FAYSAL REPRESENTED THE SAG AT AN EARLIER </p><p>SYRIA-EGYPT-SAUDI ARABIA SUMMIT IN EGYPT, ALSO IN </p><p>DECEMBER, AND AT THE SHARM AL-SHAYKH ANTI-TERRORISM </p><p>SUMMIT (ILLUSTRATING THE KING\'S CONTINUED POLICY </p><p>ENGAGEMENT, FAHD REPORTEDLY OVERRULED ABDULLAH AND </p><p>SULTAN\'S RELUCTANCE TO ATTEND THE SUMMIT, INSISTING THAT </p><p>THE SAG BE REPRESENTED). </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>BURNISHING CREDENTIALS:  AT HOME AND ABROAD </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) AT HOME, ABDULLAH IS NOW MEETING VIRTUALLY ALL </p><p>HIGH-LEVEL FOREIGN VISITORS TO SAUDI ARABIA (USUALLY ONE </p><p>A DAY AND OFTEN SEVERAL MORE) AND IS CONDUCTING </p><p>WIDELY-PUBLICIZED AND QUITE INTENSE TELEPHONE DIPLOMACY </p><p>WITH ARAB AND OTHER FOREIGN LEADERS.  BY CONTRAST, </p><p>MINDEF SULTAN - LONG CONSIDERED BY FOREIGN PUNDITS AS A </p><p>RIVAL TO ABDULLAH WHO WOULD INTRUDE ON THE CROWN </p><p>PRINCE\'S SPACE - IS MUCH LESS VISIBLE AND CLEARLY </p><p>SECONDARY IN THESE FOREIGN CONTACTS.  ALL THIS HAS </p><p>CERTAINLY HELPED BURNISH THE CROWN PRINCE\'S DOMESTIC AND </p><p>INTERNATIONAL CREDENTIALS AND HELPED RAISE HIS RATHER </p><p>LOW PROFILE IN THE DIPLOMATIC ARENA STEMMING FROM FAHD\'S </p><p>PREVIOUSLY JEALOUS OVERSIGHT OF FOREIGN POLICY, NOT TO </p><p>MENTION THE CROWN PRINCE\'S RETICENCE STEMMING FROM A </p><p>SPEECH IMPEDIMENT. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) ABDULLAH\'S ACTIVISM ON THE INTERNATIONAL STAGE </p><p>PERMITS HIM TO PROJECT HIMSELF AS A DE FACTO HEAD OF </p><p>STATE -- A ROLE IN WHICH HE APPEARS TO BE INCREASINGLY </p><p>COMFORTABLE.  ABDULLAH WAS AN ACTIVE PARTICIPANT IN </p><p>DAMASCUS AND, BY SAUDI ACCOUNT, WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN </p><p>ENSURING THAT IRAQ NOT BE INVITED TO THE CAIRO SUMMIT. </p><p>OTHER MEETINGS, SUCH AS THE CAIRO SUMMIT, WILL LIKELY </p><p>FURTHER BOOST THE CROWN PRINCE\'S STATURE.  IN SHORT, </p><p>DOMESTICALLY, THE SAUDIS ARE GETTING USED TO SEEING </p><p>ABDULLAH IN CHARGE.  ARAB LEADERS ARE LEARNING TO DO THE </p><p>SAME. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p>THE INNER CIRCLE:  CONFLICTING ADVICE AND FRUSTRATION </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) AS ABDULLAH BURNISHES HIS CREDENTIALS HERE AND </p><p>ABROAD, WE ARE TOLD THERE IS RISING IMPATIENCE WITHIN </p><p>HIS INNER CIRCLE THAT THE CROWN PRINCE ASSERT HIMSELF </p><p>MORE WITH REGARD TO THE KING; THAT IS, THAT ABDULLAH </p><p>TAKE A MORE VOCAL POSITION ON KEY ISSUES WHICH ARE </p><p>BEFORE THE SENIOR LEADERSHIP.  THIS VIEW, REPORTEDLY </p><p>HELD BY YOUNGER MEMBERS OF ABDULLAH\'S FAMILY, HAS BEEN </p><p>COUNTERED BY THE APPROACH OF SENIOR ADVISORS -- </p><p>PRINCIPALLY SHAYKH ABD AL-AZIZ AL-TUWAYJRI -- WHO </p><p>COUNSEL PATIENCE AND RESTRAINT.  TO DATE ABDULLAH HAS </p><p>EMBRACED THE LATTER VIEW, PERHAPS COGNIZANT THAT LITTLE </p><p>WOULD BE GAINED, AND MUCH COULD BE LOST, BY PUSHING THE </p><p>LIMITS OF EXISTING LINES OF AUTHORITY AND RESPONSIBILITY </p><p>WITH A KING WHO HAS NEVER BEEN RETICENT TO EXERCISE </p><p>POWER, AND WHO COULD THEORETICALLY, AT LEAST, REMOVE </p><p>ABDULLAH AS HEIR APPARENT. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) THE SHIFTING LINES OF AUTHORITY, AND UNCERTAINTY </p><p>OVER WHETHER AND WHEN THE KING WILL WEIGH IN ON MATTERS, </p><p>HAS GENERATED FRUSTRATION AMONG THE CROWN PRINCE\'S </p><p>CLOSEST SUPPORTERS.  A FORMER U.S. MILITARY ADVISOR TO </p><p>THE SANG AND CLOSE FRIEND OF SHAYKH TUWAYJRI FOR OVER </p><p>TWENTY YEARS DESCRIBES TUWAYJRI AS "DEPRESSED" OVER THE </p><p>CURRENT STATE OF AFFAIRS WITHIN THE HIGHEST COUNCILS OF </p><p>THE RULING FAMILY.  TUWAYJRI REPORTEDLY HAS HAD TO </p><p>SUFFER BROADSIDES FROM YOUNGER ABDULLAH FAMILY MEMBERS </p><p>WHO CHARGE THAT TUWAYJRI IS OLD, OUT OF TOUCH, AND NO </p><p>LONGER DISPENSES SOUND ADVICE TO THE CROWN PRINCE. </p><p>TUWAYJRI\'S VISIBLE PRESENCE AT THE TRIPARTITE SUMMIT IN </p><p>DAMASCUS, AND HIS RECENT REGIONAL TRAVELS ON BEHALF OF </p><p>ABDULLAH, TO SYRIA AND MOROCCO, HOWEVER, REAFFIRM THAT </p><p>ABDULLAH HAS NOT ABANDONED HIS LONG-STANDING </p><p>CONFIDANTE.  INDEED, TUWAYJRI WILL ACCOMPANY HIM TO </p><p>CAIRO ON JUNE 21. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>IMPLICATIONS FOR THE U.S. </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) WHILE ABDULLAH WILL QUIETLY BEGIN TO PUT HIS </p><p>OWN IMPRIMATUR ON SAUDI DIPLOMACY, WE WILL ALSO BE </p><p>WATCHING TO SEE IF AND HOW THE CONVENTIONAL THINKING ON </p><p>ABDULLAH -- MORE ATTUNED TO SYRIAN AND ARAB CONCERNS -- </p><p>IS TRANSLATED INTO ANY SPECIFIC AGENDA.  IN ADDITION TO </p><p>ARAB AND BROADER MUSLIM INTERESTS, AS WE HAVE REPORTED </p><p>BEFORE (RIYADH 29), ABDULLAH IS ATTUNED TO THE DOMESTIC </p><p>POLITICS OF SAUDI ARABIA, ITS SECURITY REQUIREMENTS, AND </p><p>THE AFFECT THAT THE SAG\'S OVERSEAS COMMITMENTS WILL HAVE </p><p>ON DOMESTIC PRIORITIES OR ON THE VERY CONSERVATIVE SAUDI </p><p>POPULACE.  THAT SAID, CHANGE IS NOT A HALLMARK OF SAUDI </p><p>GOVERNANCE AND ABDULLAH, WHO HAS BEEN FAITHFULLY </p><p>DEFERENTIAL TO FAHD, HAS GIVEN NO INDICATION THAT HE IS </p><p>SEEKING ANY DRAMATIC REVERSAL OF CURRENT POLICIES. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) THE CROWN PRINCE HAS REPEATEDLY AND </p><p>EMPHATICALLY STRESSED HIS PERSONAL COMMITMENT TO A </p><p>STRONG U.S.-SAUDI BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP AND APPEARS </p><p>ANXIOUS TO DEMONSTRATE THAT HE WILL KEEP U.S. POLICY </p><p>INTERESTS FIRMLY IN VIEW.  WE EXPECT THIS TO CONTINUE. </p><p>AT THE SAME TIME, ABDULLAH HAS SPOKEN FORCEFULLY ABOUT </p><p>ARAB RIGHTS AND FEAR THAT A STALEMATE IN THE PEACE </p><p>PROCESS WILL ONLY SPAWN THE POPULARITY OF EXTREMISTS. </p><p>HE BELIEVES THAT IT PROFITS THE AL SAUD AND THE U.S. </p><p>LITTLE, IF BY ACCEDING TO U.S. WISHES, THE RULING FAMILY </p><p>ALIENATES KEY DOMESTIC CONSTITUENCIES.  UNDER ABDULLAH\'S </p><p>INCREASING INFLUENCE, WE EXPECT THE SAG TO ADHERE </p><p>CLOSELY TO THE ARAB CONSENSUS, INCLUDING:  ESTABLISHMENT </p><p>OF A JUST AND LASTING PEACE BASED ON THE PRINCIPLE OF </p><p>LAND FOR PEACE.  ABDULLAH HAS REPEATEDLY STRESSED HIS </p><p>PERSONAL BOTTOM LINE FOR THE PEACE PROCESS -- </p><p>INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENT ON THE STATUS OF JERUSALEM. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) OF SPECIAL INTEREST TO THE U.S. IS WHETHER </p><p>ABDULLAH WILL SEEK TO PLAY A MORE FORCEFUL AND ACTIVIST </p><p>ROLE IN ARAB COUNCILS THAN HAS TRADITIONALLY BEEN THE </p><p>CASE FOR THE SAG.  ABDULLAH\'S LONGSTANDING TIES TO ASAD </p><p>MAY GIVE HIM A SPECIAL INFUENCE WITH THE SYRIANS, BUT </p><p>THE REVERSE IS MORE LIKELY TO PROVE TRUE.   HIS FORCEFUL </p><p>LINE ON IRAQI PARTICIPATION AT THE CAIRO SUMMIT IS </p><p>PERHAPS A HARBINGER OF GREATER EFFORTS TO SHAPE ARAB </p><p>POSITIONS RATHER THAN REACT TO THEM. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C) SEE RIYADH 29 (NOTAL) FOR MORE BIOGRAPHIC </p><p>INFORMATION ON CROWN PRINCE ABDULLAH. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>KATTOUF </p><p></p></div>
