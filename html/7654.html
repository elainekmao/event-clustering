MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  04-25-13 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, PINS, CE, NO, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  Key minister expresses confidence that talks </p><p>will get back on track; Opposition hits out at Norway </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  (A) FBIS Reston Va DTG 250310Z APR 03 </p><p> </p><p>-      (B) Colombo 707, and previous </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Lewis Amselem, Deputy Chief of </p><p>Mission.  Reasons:  1.5 (B, D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  In an April 24 press conference, </p><p>Minister G.L. Peiris, the government\'s chief spokesman </p><p>and negotiator, expressed confidence that the peace </p><p>process will get back on track.  He noted that the GSL\'s </p><p>formal reply to the Tigers\' statement pulling out of the </p><p>peace talks was still being put together.  In other </p><p>news, the Opposition is hitting out hard against the </p><p>Norwegian facilitation effort.  Despite Peiris\' </p><p>relatively upbeat tone, the Tigers have given no </p><p>indication they are backing down.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) KEY MINISTER\'S COMMENTS:  In an April 24 press </p><p>conference, a key Sri Lankan government minister has </p><p>expressed confidence that the peace process will get </p><p>back on track.  Government spokesman and chief </p><p>negotiator Minister G.L. Peiris told reporters that the </p><p>GSL was confident about settling issues related to the </p><p>Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) April 21 pullout </p><p>from the peace talks.  (Note:  Per Ref B, in another </p><p>negative signal, the LTTE on April 24 postponed the next </p><p>meeting of a key humanitarian assistance committee.) </p><p>Underscoring that he thought the problems leading to the </p><p>suspension of the talks were really quite "limited," </p><p>Minister Peiris said what mattered now was not to assign </p><p>blame, but rather to look at means by which talks could </p><p>be resumed.  "We have to recognize that there is a </p><p>limited problem and try to resolve it...It is certainly </p><p>not the end of the peace process," he said.  (Note:  See </p><p>Septel for local reaction to Ambassador Wills\' April 24 </p><p>remarks re the Tigers\' pullout from the talks.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) In conciliatory remarks toward the LTTE, </p><p>Peiris said the government would continue to work on </p><p>ways to reduce the size of the Jaffna military exclusion </p><p>zones, especially the troop presence in Jaffna city.  He </p><p>went on to emphasize that the ceasefire agreement was </p><p>still in place, there was no threat of war starting </p><p>again, or a need for security to be strengthened due to </p><p>the suspension of talks.  (Note:  Per Ref B, President </p><p>Kumaratunga and members of her party have been turning </p><p>up the heat on the government, urging it to return to </p><p>emergency security measures in light of the Tigers\' </p><p>pullout from the talks.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Peiris said he expected dialogue with the LTTE </p><p>to resume sooner rather than later and he said he </p><p>thought the group would reconsider its decision not to </p><p>attend the donors conference slated to take place in </p><p>Tokyo in June.  Regarding a formal response to the </p><p>Tiger\'s April 21 statement, Peiris noted that the GSL\'s </p><p>formal reply was still being put together, but should be </p><p>ready by next week.  (Note:  Prime Minister </p><p>Wickremesinghe had sent the Tigers a placeholder </p><p>response on April 22 -- see Ref B.)  When asked, Peiris </p><p>conceded that as far as he knew the Norwegian government </p><p>facilitators had not managed to speak with chief Tiger </p><p>negotiator Anton Balasingham this week and were having </p><p>problems getting responses from other LTTE officials. </p><p>(Note:  Per Peiris\' comments, the Norwegians have </p><p>confirmed as much to us re LTTE non-communicativeness. </p><p>We also hear from the British High Commission that the </p><p>London-based Balasingham is refusing to talk to the </p><p>HMG.) </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) PRESSURE ON NORWEGIANS:  In other peace process- </p><p>related news, the Opposition political parties continue </p><p>to ramp up their criticism of the Norwegian facilitation </p><p>effort, harshly accusing the GoN of favoring the LTTE. </p><p>The most recent criticism centers around a yet to be </p><p>fully developed proposal by the Norwegian-led Sri Lanka </p><p>Monitoring Mission (SLMM) that would grant recognition </p><p>to the Sea Tigers, the naval wing of the LTTE, to </p><p>operate in Sri Lanka\'s coastal waters under certain </p><p>conditions.  (Note:  There have been a number of </p><p>confrontations at sea between the LTTE and the GSL, and </p><p>both sides had tasked the SLMM to look into the matter.) </p><p>The Opposition has accused the SLMM of trying to </p><p>"divide" Sri Lanka and strengthen the LTTE via its work </p><p>on this matter.  Taking matters further, the National </p><p>Bhikku Front, an organization of Buddhist monks </p><p>affiliated with the radical Janantha Vimukthi Peramuna </p><p>(JVP) party, marched on the Norwegian Embassy on </p><p>April 24 to protest against the SLMM.  When we spoke to </p><p>him, Norwegian embassy Polchief Tomas Stangeland </p><p>downplayed the march, noting that it was one of many </p><p>anti-peace process demonstrations and that it was in </p><p>fact smaller than some previous marches.  While noting </p><p>that the criticism by the Opposition was getting a bit </p><p>annoying, Stangeland stressed that the GoN would </p><p>continue its facilitation efforts until told not to by </p><p>the GSL and the LTTE. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) COMMENT:  Since the start of the peace process </p><p>in late 2001, G.L. Peiris has proven to be a chronic </p><p>optimist, searching for positive signs in every negative </p><p>event.  His April 24 remarks, while measured, conformed </p><p>to the norm in their relatively upbeat, conciliatory </p><p>nature.  Thus far, however, the Tigers have given no </p><p>sign they are backing down.  Given the fact they are </p><p>being whipsawed by the LTTE and hammered by the </p><p>Opposition, the Norwegians are clearly having a tough </p><p>time finding a way to sort things out.  (Note:  The LTTE </p><p>will be striking a particularly militaristic pose for </p><p>the next several days:  Tiger celebrations of the </p><p>group\'s 2000 seizure of the key Elephant Pass access </p><p>point between Jaffna Peninsula and the mainland reach </p><p>their apotheosis on April 28.)  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
