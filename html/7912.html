KUWAIT 1772 </p><p>     B. KUWAIT 1759 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: (U) AMBASSADOR RICHARD H. JONES; REASON:  1.5 (B,D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY:  Reftels reported on GOK\'s efforts to address </p><p>the issue of </p><p>trafficking in persons, an issue on which it is increasingly </p><p>engaged.  This </p><p>message provides an update on GOK initiatives as well as a </p><p>snapshot of opinions </p><p>of source country embassies in Kuwait voiced during a May 7 </p><p>lunch at the </p><p>Ambassador\'s residence.  Although all countries involved </p><p>agreed that Kuwait </p><p>has a problem with its domestic servants, all want to avoid </p><p>public </p><p>condemnation being used as the tool for change, fearing it </p><p>will complicate </p><p>their own efforts.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>(C) SOURCE COUNTRY VIEWPOINTS </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>2. (C) The Ambassador hosted a lunch May 7 for </p><p>representatives of source </p><p>countries for domestic labor, in order to inform them of the </p><p>upcoming </p><p>Trafficking in Persons Report and to seek their views on the </p><p>situation of </p><p>domestic workers in Kuwait.  The ambassadors of India, Sri </p><p>Lanka and Indonesia </p><p>attended, along with the Philippine labor attache and a </p><p>Bangladeshi </p><p>counterpart.  Due to the sensitivity of this issue to the </p><p>source countries, </p><p>the very purpose of the gathering should be treated as </p><p>classified. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Indian Ambassador Singh (protect throughout) said the </p><p>problem of </p><p>exploitation of domestics in Kuwait affects only a "very </p><p>small" percentage (of </p><p>what is, however, a very large population:  hundreds of </p><p>thousands of </p><p>individuals).  He stressed that his own government takes the </p><p>problem of </p><p>exploitation very seriously.  At one point, Indian women had </p><p>been prohibitied </p><p>from seeking work in Kuwait, but this ban had proved </p><p>counter-productive. </p><p>Now, the GOI limits work permits for Kuwait to women over 30 </p><p>years of age </p><p>and discourages women outside of a few specific states known </p><p>for their </p><p>conservative social mores from working in Kuwait.  Such steps </p><p>had reduced </p><p>past problems markedly.  Asked about his personal experience </p><p>in working </p><p>through cases with the GOK, he said that he has alway found </p><p>Kuwaiti </p><p>officials to be "helpful and responsive."  For instance, </p><p>about six months </p><p>ago, at MFA\'s instigation, the GOK opened a conciliation </p><p>center attached to </p><p>the Dasman police station that processes domestics who face </p><p>deportation. </p><p>The center was off to a slow start, but it was a step in the </p><p>right direction, </p><p>in his view.  He remarked that the Kuwaitis feel "very </p><p>embarrassed" by reports </p><p>of exploitation, because they are very sensitive about their </p><p>international </p><p>reputation.  As a result of working collaboratively with the </p><p>GOK since his </p><p>arrival fifteen months ago, he added, the situation of Indian </p><p>domestics has </p><p>improved to the point that his embassy has been able to close </p><p>its safehaven. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Drawing on his own experience, Singh recommended that </p><p>the USG avoid a </p><p>confrontational approach:  it is not necessary, and would </p><p>likely be </p><p>counter-productive.  He thought cooperative engagement by the </p><p>USG could be very </p><p>supportive of bilateral efforts by India and other source </p><p>countries, whereas </p><p>public embarrassment of Kuwait could undermine the source </p><p>countries\' ongoing </p><p>efforts.  In his view, given that Kuwait has not been </p><p>mentioned in the TIP </p><p>Report before, it would be "a bit unfair" to place it in Tier </p><p>III this year; a </p><p>year from now, if there is no substantial improvement, we </p><p>would be much more </p><p>justified in taking a hard line.  The ambassadors of Sri </p><p>Lanka and Indonesia, </p><p>and the representative of the Bangladesh embassy, all agreed. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Philippine labor attache Angelo Jimenez (protect </p><p>throughout) assessed </p><p>the exploitation problem as much more common in his </p><p>community:  about 30 </p><p>percent of Filipina domestics reported some problem, such as </p><p>underpayment, </p><p>overwork, lack of rest, lack of adequate food, or restriction </p><p>on their </p><p>freedom of movement.  (This latter complaint, Singh </p><p>commented, contains a </p><p>large culture-clash component: by Kuwaiti standards, it is </p><p>normal and prudent </p><p>(even a duty) to restrict women\'s movements for their own </p><p>protection in a </p><p>country with a very large population of unaccompanied male </p><p>workers; Filipinas, </p><p>on the other hand, are used to much more freedom of movement, </p><p>Jimenez </p><p>acknowledged.) Jimenez estimated that for every domestic who </p><p>registered a </p><p>complaint with his embassy, there was at least one more who </p><p>did not have the </p><p>opportunity to do so.  Six percent of the complaints filed </p><p>with the Philippine </p><p>embassy involve sexual abuse.  In his experience, Kuwaitis\' </p><p>first response </p><p>to information about abuses is denial that any Kuwaiti could </p><p>behave so badly, </p><p>but he has found that if he persists, they eventually accept </p><p>the painful </p><p>truth and support corrective action.  The Philippine Embassy </p><p>continues to </p><p>operate a shelter at the embassy for runaway domestics. </p><p>Despite his different </p><p>perception of the magnitude of the problem, he agreed with </p><p>Singh that GOK </p><p>officials were generally cooperative and that a Tier III </p><p>designation would </p><p>be counter-productive at this time. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) In sum, all countries represented agreed on some key </p><p>issues. </p><p>They agree Kuwait has a problem with its treatment of TCN </p><p>domestic servants. </p><p>They agree most of their Kuwaiti contacts are embarrassed by </p><p>the problem. </p><p>They agree Kuwaiti law needs to be amended to provide </p><p>protection to domestic </p><p>servants.  They agree Kuwaiti officials are responsive when </p><p>specific cases </p><p>are brought to their attention.  They agree further </p><p>engagement with the </p><p>Kuwaitis on the issue of trafficking in persons is key to </p><p>solving this </p><p>difficult issue, and that public embarrassment of the </p><p>Kuwaitis by the US </p><p>would not be helpful to the cause. </p><p> </p><p>(U)GOK INITIATIVES </p><p>------------------ </p><p>7. (C) MFA Americas Dept. Deputy Director Ayham al-Omar </p><p>confirmed to PolChief </p><p>May 7 that a newly-established inter-ministerial committee </p><p>had held its first </p><p>meeting this week, chaired by his boss, Americas Dept. </p><p>Director Amb. Khaled </p><p>al-Babtain, and including representatives of the Ministries </p><p>of Interior and </p><p>Social Affairs.  The committee was considering opening a GOK </p><p>safehaven for </p><p>abused domestics, studying the question from all its aspects </p><p>-- to protect the </p><p>rights of employees and employers alike.  Ayham claimed that </p><p>for the past year </p><p>or so, if any employer refuses to provide an airline ticket </p><p>home for a domestic </p><p>who has not served out her contract, the Ministry of Interior </p><p>pays for the </p><p>ticket but blacklists the employer, so that he cannot sponsor </p><p>any more </p><p>domestics.  (Singh also mentioned such a blacklist.) </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Regarding the issue of camel jockeys, Ayham said the </p><p>Ministry of </p><p>Interior has told the Camel Racing Club that all jockeys must </p><p>be at least 18 </p><p>years old (vice 15 "permitted by ILO Convention").  He added </p><p>that the Club has </p><p>been placed under the purview of the Ministry of Social </p><p>Affairs.  (Note: </p><p>PolOff has a meeting scheduled with the Chairman of the </p><p>Kuwait Camel Racing </p><p>Club on May 13 and will discuss with him these new </p><p>regulations.) </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
