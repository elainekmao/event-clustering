Nam </p><p>Cam) drew to a close on June 5 with a three-hour recitation of </p><p>their sentences.  As rumored, the underworld kingpin Nam Cam </p><p>received two death sentences (by firing squad) for murder and </p><p>bribery, as well as a total of 42 years in jail for five other </p><p>crimes.  The three high-ranking GVN officials who were </p><p>convicted all received prison sentences: </p><p> </p><p>a) Pham Sy Chien, former deputy head of the Supreme People\'s </p><p>Prosecution Panel in Hanoi (6 years); </p><p> </p><p>b) Bui Quoc Huy, Deputy Minister of Public Security in Hanoi </p><p>during July-August 2002 and former Director of Ho Chi Minh </p><p>City Police during 1996-2001 (4 years); </p><p> </p><p>c) Tran Mai Hanh, former Director of the Voice of Vietnam </p><p>State Radio and General Secretary of the Vietnamese Journalist </p><p>Association (10 years). </p><p> </p><p>These three former GVN officials are still at large and have </p><p>three months to appeal their sentences to the Supreme People\'s </p><p>Court in Hanoi before being arrested.  Thirteen of the </p><p>defendants in jail were released for time served, and the </p><p>remainder of those currently in jail still have the right to </p><p>appeal.  A total of six death sentences and five life </p><p>sentences were handed down.  Two journalists were found guilty </p><p>of receiving bribes and were sentenced to 10-12 years.  There </p><p>was a noticeable increased plainclothes security presence in </p><p>the HCMC People\'s Court courtyard, where a crowd of onlookers </p><p>had gathered to hear the sentencing.  Contacts from yesterday </p><p>were more inhibited today about offering their opinions.  Post </p><p>will report septel in greater detail. </p><p>YAMAUCHI </p><p></p></div>
