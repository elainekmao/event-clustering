REASONS: </p><p>1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>IMPORTANCE OF POLITICAL DIALOGUE </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) IN A NOVEMBER 12 CONVERSATION WITH THE AMBASSADOR AND </p><p>POLITICAL SECTION CHIEF, ZANU-PF POLITBURO MEMBER SOLOMON MUJURU </p><p>SAID HE WAS PROUD OF HIS ROLE IN ENSURING THAT THE SEPTEMBER BY- </p><p>ELECTION IN CHIKOMBA (HIS HOME BASE) WAS THE MOST PEACEFUL BY- </p><p>ELECTION SINCE JUNE 2000.  HE TOLD US THAT HE HAD HOSTED A </p><p>BARBECUE AT HIS LOCAL HOME THAT INCLUDED THE RULING PARTY AND MDC </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY CANDIDATES, AS WELL AS LOCAL OFFICIALS FROM BOTH </p><p>PARTIES, AT WHICH HE HAD URGED EVERYONE INVOLVED TO CONDUCT A </p><p>PEACEFUL CAMPAIGN.  HE SAID HE WAS WORKING WITH OTHERS TO MINIMIZE </p><p>INCIDENTS OF POLITICAL VIOLENCE IN THE RUNUP TO THE PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>ELECTION IN EARLY 2002. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) MUJURU EXPRESSED REGRET THAT THE POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT HAS </p><p>BECOME SO CHARGED THAT MANY ZIMBABWEANS DO NOT FEEL FREE TO SHARE </p><p>THEIR POLITICAL OPINIONS.  HE SAID BOTH PARTIES SHOULD BE ABLE TO </p><p>ENGAGE IN A DIALOGUE ABOUT THE WAY FORWARD, AND HE THOUGHT AN </p><p>ELECTORAL CODE OF CONDUCT WAS A GOOD IDEA.  THE ELECTION CAMPAIGN </p><p>SHOULD BE A CLEAN FIGHT, AND BOTH SIDES SHOULD BE ABLE TO ACCEPT </p><p>THE OUTCOME.  IT WAS NOT IN ZIMBABWE\'S INTEREST FOR POLITICAL </p><p>PARTIES TO REGARD EACH OTHER AS ENEMIES INSTEAD OF LEGITIMATE </p><p>OPPONENTS, BUT HE ACKNOWLEDGED THE DIFFICULTY OF BUILDING TRUST </p><p>BETWEEN ZANU-PF AND THE MDC AND OF CREATING AN ENABLING </p><p>ENVIRONMENT FOR CONSTRUCTIVE INTER-PARTY TALKS.  MUJURU ASSERTED </p><p>THAT THE MDC WOULD NOW CONTROL PARLIAMENT IF THE "YES" VOTE HAD </p><p>CARRIED THE DAY IN THE FEBRUARY 2000 REFERENDUM, AS THE DRAFT </p><p>CONSTITUTION WOULD HAVE ABOLISHED THE 30 SEATS APPOINTED BY THE </p><p>PRESIDENT AND INCREASED THE NUMBER OF SEATS REPRESENTING URBAN </p><p>AREAS, THE OPPOSITION PARTY\'S STRONGHOLD.  HE SAID HIS "FRIENDS IN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03439  170913Z </p><p>ZANU-PF" QUESTION HIS OPENNESS WITH PEOPLE OF ALL POLITICAL </p><p>STRIPES.  HE JOKED THAT HE TALKS TO THE COMMERCIAL FARMERS SO MUCH </p><p>THAT WHEN HE SPEAKS WITH PRESIDENT MUGABE, THE FIRST THING THE </p><p>PRESIDENT ASKS IS WHETHER MUJURU HAS FARMERS WITH HIM. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) MUJURU SAID THE DECISION ON THE TIMING OF THE ELECTION </p><p>WOULD BE MADE AT ZANU-PF\'S CONGRESS IN DECEMBER AND WOULD BE MADE </p><p>PUBLIC SOON AFTER THAT.  ASKED WHO WOULD WIN THE ELECTION, MUJURU </p><p>SAID ONLY THAT IT WOULD BE EXTREMELY CLOSE.  HE PREDICTED THAT THE </p><p>VICTORIOUS PARTY WOULD GARNER BETWEEN 51 AND 55% OF THE TOTAL VOTE </p><p>COUNT.  (N.B.  MUJURU RECENTLY REMARKED TO A BRITISH COLLEAGUE </p><p>THAT THE RULING PARTY WOULD WIN 55% OF THE VOTE.  ASKED WHAT </p><p>PERCENTAGE IT WOULD GARNER IF MUGABE WERE NOT THE CANDIDATE, </p><p>MUJURU REPORTEDLY SAID "75%."  END N.B.) </p><p> </p><p>LINKS WITH MILITARY </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR ASKED WHETHER MUJURU HAD RETAINED CLOSE </p><p>LINKS TO MILITARY COMMANDERS SINCE HIS RETIREMENT AS CHIEF OF THE </p><p>DEFENSE FORCES IN 1992.  YES, MUJURU REPLIED, HE STILL HAD GOOD </p><p>RELATIONS WITH "THE BOYS."  THE AMBASSADOR NOTED THAT HE HAD HAD A </p><p>GOOD MEETING RECENTLY WITH MINISTER OF DEFENSE SEKERAMAYI.  MUJURI </p><p>SAID SEKERAMAYI HAD CALLED HIM IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS TO BRIEF HIM </p><p>ON THAT MEETING, AND THAT THE MINISTER SHARED THE AMBASSADOR\'S </p><p>POSITIVE ASSESSMENT OF THEIR CONVERSATION. </p><p> </p><p>FAST TRACK RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) MUJURU WAS NOT HAPPY WITH HOW THE FAST TRACK RESETTLEMENT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03439  170913Z </p><p>PROGRAM HAS UNFOLDED.  THE PARTY, HE CLAIMED, HAD SET OUT VERY </p><p>CLEAR AND REASONABLE CRITERIA FOR LAND REFORM.  THE UNLEASHING OF </p><p>THE WAR VETERANS, HOWEVER, HAD KNOCKED THE PROGRAM OFF-TRACK, AND </p><p>IT WAS NOT "WORKING AS WE HAD PLANNED."  NOTING THAT HE WAS A </p><p>WHEAT AND SOYBEAN FARMER HIMSELF, HE EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT </p><p>RESETTLED FAMILIES WERE NOT BEING PROVIDED WITH SUFFICIENT </p><p>RESOURCES TO TURN THEIR NEW PROPERTIES INTO SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC </p><p>ENTERPRISES. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) ALTHOUGH NOT PARTICULARLY ARTICULATE OR INTELLECTUALLY </p><p>IMPRESSIVE, GENERAL MUJURU CARRIES SIGNIFICANT BEHIND-THE-SCENES </p><p>INFLUENCE WITH KEY DECISION-MAKERS, AS EVIDENCED BY SEKERAMAYI\'S </p><p>TELPHONE CALL TO HIM.  HE IS, IN FACT, CONSIDERED A POTENTIAL </p><p>KINGMAKER BY MANY OBSERVERS.  IN ADDITION, SOME OF THE MILITARY\'S </p><p>KEY COMMANDERS SERVED UNDER MUJURU, RETAIN STRONG LOYALTIES TO </p><p>HIM, AND WOULD FOLLOW HIS LEAD IF THE DETERIORATION OF THE </p><p>POLITICAL EVENTS HERE SPARKED SOME DEGREE OF MILITARY INVOLVEMENT. </p><p>CONSEQUENTLY, MUJURU IS REPORTEDLY ONE OF THE FEW PEOPLE WHOSE </p><p>ADVICE PRESIDENT MUGABE TAKES SERIOUSLY.  GIVEN HIS POSITIVE ROLE </p><p>IN THE CHIKOMBA BY-ELECTION AND HIS MODERATE, NO NONSENSE VIEWS ON </p><p>ISSUES SUCH AS POLITICAL DIALOGUE, WE BELIEVE HE CAN, AND IS </p><p>TRYING TO, MINIMIZE THE RULING PARTY\'S WORST EXCESSES. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p>@@@OASYS@@@ </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ4191 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  03439  01 OF 02  170844Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DODE-00  DS-00    VC-00 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   VCE-00   NSAE-00  CAEX-01  IRM-00   EPAE-00 </p><p>      DSCC-00  DRL-02   NFAT-00  SAS-00     /003W </p><p>                  ------------------3FB140  170844Z /38 </p><p>P 170759Z NOV 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 0300 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 003439 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>BRUSSELS ALSO FOR USEU </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL. 11/13/11 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR\'S DISCUSSION WITH INFLUENTIAL ZANU-PF </p><p>POLITBURO MEMBER </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY POLITICAL SECTION CHIEF MATT HARRINGTON.
