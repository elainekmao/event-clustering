<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 001516 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR SA/INS, LONDON FOR POL/GURNEY, NSC FOR MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/07/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PTER, NP, Political Parties </p><p>SUBJECT: MEETING WITH ONE OF NEPAL\'S MOST SENIOR DEMOCRATS: </p><p> AN UNLIKELY PRIME MINISTERIAL CANDIDATE </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. KATHMANDU 1486 </p><p>     B. KATHMANDU 1507 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Michael E. Malinowski for Reasons 1.5 (b) and </p><p> (d) </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p>======== </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) On August 7, the Ambassador met with Krishna Prasad </p><p>Bhattarai, a founding father of Nepal\'s democracy, and </p><p>Narayan Khadga, a former Vice Chairman of the National </p><p>Planning Commission, to discuss the internal dynamics of the </p><p>Nepali Congress Party, Bhattarai\'s recent discussions with </p><p>the King, and the prospects for Bhattarai serving as a </p><p>consensus prime minister.  While Bhattarai is in good </p><p>physical condition for his age and an excellent commentator </p><p>on Nepali politics, he did not look strong enough for the </p><p>rigors of public office.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>A Meeting with One of Nepal\'s Oldest Democrats </p><p>============================================= == </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) On August 7, the Ambassador met with long-time </p><p>friend, former Prime Minister, and co-founder of the Nepali </p><p>Congress Party, Krishna Prasad Bhattarai.  Accompanying </p><p>Bhattarai was former Vice Chairman of the National Planning </p><p>Commission, Narayan Khadga.  (Note:  Both are members of the </p><p>Nepali Congress (NC) Party and have sided with the faction </p><p>headed by former Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba.  End </p><p>note.)  Bhattarai was imprisoned from 1961 to 1971 for his </p><p>democratic activism and now at age 79 lives in retirement on </p><p>the outskirts of Kathmandu.  Always outspoken and a hero of </p><p>Nepal\'s democratic movement, he provided the Ambassador with </p><p>his views on Nepal\'s acrimonious politics and recent press </p><p>reports that Bhattarai may emerge as a consensus prime </p><p>ministerial candidate. </p><p> </p><p>Dialogue with the King </p><p>======================= </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  Three weeks ago, Bhattarai met with King Gyanendra </p><p>to discuss with him the impasse between the political parties </p><p>and the government.  At the meeting, the King affirmed his </p><p>commitment to democracy but admitted deep concern over the </p><p>current political stalemate.  Bhattarai told the King that </p><p>whereas in the past Nepalese Kings could be firm, direct </p><p>monarchical involvement in politics was no longer risk-free. </p><p>Bhattarai warned the King that if he continues to ignore the </p><p>parties, the parties may attack the Palace.  In their </p><p>discussion of the Maoists, Bhattarai reported the King to say </p><p>that they must be suppressed.  Bhattarai called the exchange </p><p>frank, describing the King as a gentleman, who continues to </p><p>deserve the respect of the Nepalese people. </p><p> </p><p>Views on Party Rival Koirala </p><p>============================= </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) When the Ambassador pressed Bhattarai for his opinion </p><p>on the NC\'s next steps, he stated that the King must return </p><p>what was taken.  (Note:  On October 4, the King dismissed </p><p>elected Prime Minister Deuba.  End note.)  Should the King </p><p>call an election, the NC will participate, Bhattarai said he </p><p>believes the King may enjoy the tensions among the parties </p><p>and the split in the NC.  Bhattarai does not foresee a </p><p>reunion of the two NC factions, blaming NC General Secretary </p><p>Girija Prasad Koirala for undermining party unity.  Bhattarai </p><p>describes Koirala as unreliable and dishonest, with little </p><p>popular support.  Bhattarai also reported that a </p><p>representative from the Indian Embassy (likely Ambassador </p><p>Shyam Saran) had visited him, at which time the Indian was </p><p>very critical of Koirala and his unwillingness to join the </p><p>current government.  Bhattarai observed that Koirala\'s stand </p><p>was a break from his past practice, which was to do whatever </p><p>the Indians requested of him.  Narayan Khadga took up where </p><p>Bhattarai left off, calling Koirala a fool for his ridiculous </p><p>public statements.  Bhattarai offered that the best sacrifice </p><p>Koirala could make for the party was to leave it. </p><p> </p><p>A Consensus Prime Minister? </p><p>============================ </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  When the Ambassador asked Bhattarai about the press </p><p>reports naming him as a consensus prime minister; the aged </p><p>and enfeebled gentleman chuckled and replied that he had no </p><p>interest in the job.  He went on to say, however, that if he </p><p>was called, he might be able to galvanize party support and </p><p>would work towards elections in a year or two. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>======== </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  Bhattarai and Khadga were engaging and very critical </p><p>of their NC party rival, Koirala.  Despite some optimism in </p><p>the press that a "father of Nepal\'s democracy" could reemerge </p><p>in Nepal\'s time of need, Bhattarai appeared too enfeebled to </p><p>be anything more than a figurehead.  He required reminders of </p><p>conversations that took place a week ago and referred to his </p><p>diary to recollect details.  His physical condition did not </p><p>look strong enough for the rigors of public office. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
