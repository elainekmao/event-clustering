<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 002831 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/10/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, KDEM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: FRIENDS OF NIGERIA HEADS OF MISSION MEETING </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter.  Reasons 1.5 (B & </p><p>D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  SUMMARY:  Ambassador Jeter hosted a meeting with </p><p>Chiefs of Mission of Germany, France, Canada, and the U.K. </p><p>on October 7 to discuss upcoming Nigerian elections.  The </p><p>Ambassador identified the need to coordinate exchanges of </p><p>information and to possibly develop coordinated policies </p><p>among this "friends of Nigeria" group.  The group came to </p><p>broad consensus on the need to engage the Presidency and </p><p>INEC over perceived shortcomings, particularly in voters </p><p>registration, and to offer encouragement to Nigerian </p><p>officials to improve the upcoming electoral process.  The </p><p>friends group agreed on the utility of regular meetings to </p><p>discuss election issues, and scheduled a follow-on meeting </p><p>October 15 to discuss the flawed voters registration </p><p>process and the issue of international elections monitors. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  Ambassador Jeter invited the Chiefs of Mission of </p><p>Germany, France, Canada and the U.K. to meet October 7 to </p><p>discuss the recently concluded voters registration exercise </p><p>and possible coordination of diplomatic approaches to the </p><p>GON on the electoral process.  There was broad consensus on </p><p>the current political situation in Nigeria, with all </p><p>agreeing that the recent impeachment move was intended to </p><p>prevent President Olusegun Obasanjo from seeking re- </p><p>election.  German Ambassador Dietmar Kreusel commented that </p><p>the impeachment process was designed primarily to convince </p><p>Obasanjo to withdraw his candidacy and that Obasanjo had </p><p>lost most of his support in the North.  With widespread </p><p>disaffection and large portions of his own party turning </p><p>against him, Kreusel speculated, Obasanjo will not be able </p><p>to "save himself by just paying out money."  The tone of </p><p>Kreusel\'s statement implied that he wanted the group to be </p><p>supportive of Obasanjo\'s reelection.  The group agreed that </p><p>the party conventions and gubernatorial elections would </p><p>also provide the opportunity for further disorder in the </p><p>political arena. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  All participants agreed that feedback from the </p><p>registration process "was not great."  The question, </p><p>according to Canadian High Commissioner Howard Strauss, was </p><p>whether it was conducted in a manner acceptable to </p><p>Nigerians.  Acting British High Commissioner Charles Bird </p><p>concurred and commented that HMG would not be able to </p><p>validate elections based solely on the results of this </p><p>registration.  Still, he wondered if it would be possible </p><p>to work with its results and move forward if actions are </p><p>taken to improve the registration and other pre-election </p><p>preparations.  One of the greatest difficulties identified </p><p>by the group was that INEC appears to have no firm timeline </p><p>for the conduct of the elections.  Without this, according </p><p>to French Ambassador Jean-Marc Simon, it is impossible to </p><p>judge whether adequate preparations have been made.  "The </p><p>1999 elections were not perfect, but this one could be </p><p>worse," he concluded. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  The group then discussed broad outlines for an </p><p>acceptable election.  Bird cautioned that efforts by the </p><p>international community should not be seen as biased </p><p>towards or against any candidate, but rather should focus </p><p>on the process.  This was seconded by Ambassador Jeter. </p><p>Bird said that HMG\'s goal is not just an election, but </p><p>stability for Nigeria in its aftermath. There was no </p><p>agreement on the benchmarks on which to judge the </p><p>elections, especially on the "free-and-fair" standard; </p><p>however, it was agreed that this subject would be the </p><p>subject of future meetings.  Bird stated that the HMG would </p><p>accept elections which are "broadly acceptable to the </p><p>majority of Nigerians and which are not challenged in the </p><p>courts."  There was some agreement among the guests that </p><p>elections would not be conducted well, but that if the </p><p>results are "reasonable and acceptable to Nigerians," the </p><p>standards should be relaxed.  However, cautioned Jeter, "we </p><p>can not set a different standard for Nigeria." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  Kreusel said that the European Union (EU) had </p><p>already agreed to a budget for observers for the Nigerian </p><p>elections; however the clear EU preference was for a </p><p>mission designed to observe both electoral preparations and </p><p>conduct.  Two problems still facing any proposed observer </p><p>mission were the lack of a timetable for elections and </p><p>uncertainty of what the goals of the mission should be. </p><p>Kreusel asked rhetorically whether it would be preferable </p><p>to mount a strong mission, which would be subject to </p><p>Nigerian elite criticism, or to back off and watch the </p><p>process deteriorate.  Jeter commented that U.S. observers </p><p>will act independently from the USG, and we do not </p><p>influence their conclusions.  Kreusel confirmed similar </p><p>expectations for the European observers.   Bird warned that </p><p>HMG viewed the 1999 elections as the baseline for </p><p>expectations in 2003, and that the Nigerians should strive </p><p>to improve on that performance. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  All participants agreed that three separate </p><p>avenues should be explored:  public statements supporting </p><p>INEC\'s efforts and encouraging more effective action; </p><p>collective approaches to INEC highlighting deficiencies in </p><p>the process and pushing it to take responsibility; and </p><p>individual but coordinated approaches to the Presidency </p><p>with warnings of the dangers of failed elections.  Kreusel </p><p>suggested that the EU would discuss the issuance of a </p><p>public statement to encourage rather than criticize the </p><p>process at the earliest opportunity.  Ambassador Jeter </p><p>suggested that the USG would explore the issuance of a </p><p>similar, parallel statement. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  COMMENT:   All attendees at this meeting agreed </p><p>that the registration process, as it stands, has serious </p><p>deficiencies that create the potential for poisoning </p><p>elections based on the exercise.   The attendees also </p><p>agreed that the process is salvageable.  There is a </p><p>similarity of Western views on the election process; </p><p>however, there may be some divergence as the process moves </p><p>forward, especially with the German and French. </p><p>Nevertheless, the convening of this group appears to be a </p><p>useful mechanism and we will continue with this initiative. </p><p>We will await the formulation of the EU public statement; </p><p>Embassy will develop a parallel statement, clearing it with </p><p>Washington before the statement is issued. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
