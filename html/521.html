CONFIDENTIAL -- ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  PRIME MINISTER NAWAZ SHARIF\'S SHARIA </p><p>(ISLAMIZATION) ACT, PASSED BY THE PAKISTANI NATIONAL </p><p>ASSEMBLY ONE YEAR AGO, WAS SYMPTOMATIC OF THE </p><p>GROWING INFLUENCE OF ISLAMIC IDEOLOGY ON PAKISTANI </p><p>POLITICS.  THE POORLY DRAFTED AND VAGUELY WORDED </p><p>DOCUMENT PRODUCED NO DRAMATIC CHANGE IN PAKISTANI </p><p>SOCIETY.  THE LAW, IN FACT, REPRESENTED A DEFEAT FOR </p><p>THE RIGHT-WING ISLAMISTS WHO HAD PROPOSED FAR MORE </p><p>SWEEPING ISLAMIZATION LEGISLATION.  NONETHELESS, </p><p>ALTHOUGH THE ISLAMIC RIGHT REMAINS BUT A PERIPHERAL </p><p>FORCE IN PAKISTANI LEGISLATIVE POLITICS, THEIR </p><p>SINGLE-MINDED PURSUIT OF THEIR GOAL OF AN ISLAMIC </p><p>STATE IS INCREASINGLY SHAPING CONTEMPORARY PAKISTANI </p><p>CULURE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  ISLAMIST ACTIVISM POSES A REAL THREAT TO </p><p>PAKISTANI STABILITY AND PROGRESS.  BY PROMOTING </p><p>INTOLERANCE WITHIN PAKISTANI SOCIETY, THE RELIGIOUS </p><p>RIGHT HAS WIDENED THE DIVISIONS BETWEEN RELIGIOUS </p><p>SECTS, CONTRIBUTED TO THE SURGE IN VIOLENCE </p><p>THROUGHOUT PAKISTAN, AND HAMPERED THE GOP\'S ABILITY </p><p>TO SET POLICY BOTH IN DOMESTIC AREAS SUCH AS FAMILY </p><p>PLANNING AND ON FOREIGN POLICY ISSUES LIKE </p><p>AFGHANISTAN AND KASHMIR. </p><p> </p><p>4.  THEIR "SUCCESSES," HOWEVER, SUCH AS THEY ARE, </p><p>HAVE NOT WON THE ISLAMISTS BROAD POPULAR SUPPORT. </p><p>WE ANTICIPATE NEITHER AN IRANIAN-STYLE ISLAMIC </p><p>REVOLUTION IN PAKISTAN NOR AN ALGERIAN-STYLE </p><p>ISLAMIST VICTORY AT THE POLLS.  RATHER WHAT WE ARE </p><p>LIKELY TO SEE IS A CONTINUING STRUGGLE BETWEEN </p><p>MODERNISTS AND ISLAMISTS TO DETERMINE THE SHAPE OF </p><p>PAKISTANI SOCIETY.  THE GOVERNMENT MEANWHILE WALKS A </p><p>FINE LINE, WORRIED ABOUT THE RELIGIOUS RIGHT\'S </p><p>ABILITY TO USE ITS MILITANT MEMBERS TO CREATE </p><p>PROBLEMS IN THE STREETS, BUT EQUALLY AWARE OF THE </p><p>THREAT TO THE NATION\'S SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC </p><p>DEVELOPMENT IF THE ISLAMISTS ADVANCE THEIR AGENDA </p><p>UNCHECKED.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>WORTH THE PAPER IT\'S PRINTED ON? </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  WHEN THE PAKISTAN NATIONAL ASSEMBLY PASSED PRIME </p><p>MINISTER NAWAZ SHARIF\'S SHARIA ("ISLAMIC LAW") BILL </p><p>IN MAY 1991, THE PM\'S CONFIDANTS PRIVATELY DESCRIBED </p><p>IT AS AN IMPORTANT VICTORY OVER THE RELIGIOUS </p><p>RIGHT.  BY INTRODUCING HIS OWN SHARIA BILL, NAWAZ </p><p>HAD ESSENTIALLY BOTH ACCEDED TO THE ISLAMISTS\' </p><p>CAMPAIGN PRESSING THE GOP TO INSTITUTE ISLAMIC LAW </p><p>AND DERAILED IT, BY WATERING THE LEGISLATION DOWN TO </p><p>THE POINT OF MEANINGLESSNESS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  THE SHARA ACT ITSELF WAS POORLY DRAFTED AND </p><p>CONSISTED PRIMARILY OF VAGUE STATEMENTS CALLING FOR </p><p>THE TRANSFORMATION OF PAKISTAN INTO AN "ISLAMIC </p><p>WELFARE STATE" AND MANDATING THAT MUSLIM CITIZENS </p><p>"ORDER THEIR LIVES ACCORDING TO ISLAMIC LAW."  THE </p><p>ONLY GOP ACTION ACTUALLY MANDATED IN ITS TEXT WAS </p><p>THE CREATION OF COMMITTEES TO STUDY METHODS OF </p><p>ISLAMIZING EDUCATION AND THE EVENTUAL ELIMINATION OF </p><p>INTEREST FROM THE ECONOMY.  IN CONTRAST TO EARLIER </p><p>SHARIA BILLS DRAFTED BY THE ISLAMIC RIGHT, NAWAZ\'S </p><p>SHARIA ACT ALSO GUARANTEED THE INVIOLABILITY OF </p><p>PAKISTAN\'S PARLIAMENTARY DEMOCRACY AND INTERNATIONAL </p><p>OBLIGATIONS AND CONTAINED LANGUAGE SAFEGUARDING THE </p><p>RIGHTS OF PAKISTAN\'S NON-MUSLIM MINORITIES.  ONE </p><p>YEAR AFTER THE ACT\'S PASSAGE, IT REMAINS ESSENTIALLY </p><p>IRRELEVANT TO PAKISTANI GOVERNMENT AND SOCIETY.  THE </p><p>FEARS OF RELIGIOUS MINORITIES, HUMAN RIGHTS WORKERS, </p><p>AND WOMEN\'S GROUPS THAT THE ACT WOULD TRANSFORM </p><p>PAKISTAN INTO A THEOCRACY, GUTTING THE ECONOMY AND </p><p>CIVIL LIBERTIES IN THE PROCESS, REMAIN ESSENTIALLY </p><p>UNREALIZED. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>ISLAMIZATION THROUGH THE BACK DOOR? </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  MEANWHILE, THE RELIGIOUS PARTIES ARE WEAKER THAN </p><p>EVER WITHIN THE LEGISLATURE, AND WITH THE DEFECTION </p><p>OF THE JAMAAT-I-ISLAMI--THE LARGEST ISLAMIST </p><p>PARTY--FROM NAWAZ\'S RULING COALITION, THEIR ABILITY </p><p>TO INFLUENCE GOVERNMENT POLICY IS FURTHER </p><p>DIMINISHED.  THE ISLAMISTS\' STATUS AS RELIGIOUS </p><p>TEACHERS AND LEADERS OF CONGREGATIONS GIVES THEM A </p><p>READY PULPIT, HOWEVER, TO PROMOTE ISLAMIZATION AS </p><p>THE ANSWER TO PROBLEMS OTHERWISE FAR FROM THE SPHERE </p><p>OF RELIGION -- THE DIVISION BETWEEN RICH AND POOR, </p><p>THE DECLINING ACCESS OF THE POOR TO EDUCATION AND </p><p>UNEMPLOYMENT, INFLATION, AND THE ERODING </p><p>LAW-AND-ORDER SITUATION. </p><p> </p><p>8.  THE ISLAMISTS\' STATUS AS RELIGIOUS LEADERS, AND </p><p>THEIR ABILITY TO BRING LARGE NUMBERS OF MILITANT </p><p>STUDENT SUPPORTERS OUT INTO THE STREETS AT SHORT </p><p>NOTICE, HAVE LED SUCCESSIVE GOVERNMENTS OF PAKISTAN </p><p>TO APPEASE THEM RATHER THAN CONFRONT THEM DIRECTLY. </p><p>UNDER PREVIOUS GOVERNMENTS, SUCH APPEASEMENT TOOK </p><p>THE FORM OF PROHIBITION, LEGISLATION DEFINING THE </p><p>POLYDOX AHMEDI SECT AS "NON-MUSLIM," AND THE </p><p>INSTITUTION OF ISLAMIC CRIMINAL PENALTIES FOR </p><p>EXTRAMARITAL SEX OR OTHER "UN-ISLAMIC" BEHAVIOR. </p><p>DESPITE NAWAZ\'S SUCCESSFUL DERAILMENT OF THE </p><p>MOVEMENT FOR A SHARIA BILL, THE RELIGIOUS RIGHT\'S </p><p>INFLUENCE OVER THE DIRECTION OF PAKISTANI CULTURE </p><p>AND SOCIETY CONTINUES TO GROW. </p><p> </p><p>9.  FOR EXAMPLE, PAKISTAN\'S FASTEST GROWING </p><p>RELIGIOUS PARTIES -- THE ANJUMAN SEPAH-I-SAHABA </p><p>PAKISTAN (ASSP) -- ACTIVELY CRUSADES FOR THE </p><p>CREATION OF A SUNNI STATE, WITH SHIAS DECLARED </p><p>"NON-MUSLIM."  BOTH THE ASSP AND ITS PRIMARY NEMESIS </p><p>THE SHIA TEHRIK-I-NIFAZ-I-FIQAH-JAFARIA (TNFJ) HAVE </p><p>PROFITED BY ARTICULATING AND ENCOURAGING A GROWING </p><p>STRAIN OF RELIGIOUS INTOLERANCE WITHIN PAKISTANI </p><p>SOCIETY WHICH IS FAR MORE WIDESPREAD, AND DANGEROUS, </p><p>THAN ANY THE NATION HAS PREVIOUSLY EXPERIENCED. </p><p> </p><p>10.  THERE HAS ALSO BEEN AN INCREASING RELIANCE BY </p><p>OFFICIALS ON "ISLAMIC" PROVISIONS IN THE PAKISTANI </p><p>PENAL CODE.  FOR EXAMPLE, THE ARTICLE WHICH </p><p>PENALIZES BLASPHEMY IS, IN THE VIEW OF MANY </p><p>OBSERVERS, INCREASINGLY BEING USED TO INTIMIDATE AND </p><p>HARRASS NON-MUSLIMS.  A PENDING CASE AGAINST </p><p>PROMINENT SOCIOLOGIST DR. AKHTAR HAMEED KHAN (REF B) </p><p>CHARGES HIS RECENTLY-PUBLISHED CHILDREN\'S STORY IS </p><p>AN ALLEGORICAL SLAP AT PROPHET MOHAMMED\'S FAMILY. </p><p>SEVERAL CHRISTIANS HAVE BEEN SIMILARLY CHARGED IN </p><p>RECENT MONTHS, USUALLY AFTER FINANCIAL OR POLITICAL </p><p>DISPUTES WITH ISLAMISTS.  A CHRISTIAN TEACHER WAS </p><p>KILLED IN JANUARY 1992 BY A TEENAGER WHO HAD READ AN </p><p>ANONYMOUS FLYER ACCUSING THE TEACHER OF INSULTING </p><p>ISLAM.  EQUALLY TROUBLING WERE THE (FORTUNATELY </p><p>UNSUCCESSFUL) EFFORTS OF THE SUNNI FUNDAMENTALIST </p><p>JAMIAT ULEMA-I-ISLAM (JUI) PARTY TO PRESSURE THE </p><p>BALOCHISTAN PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT INTO DECLARING A </p><p>LOCAL SECT, THE ZIKRIS, TO BE NON-MUSLIM.  A </p><p>DECISION TO THAT EFFECT COULD HAVE SPARKED SERIOUS </p><p>SECTARIAN VIOLENCE IN THAT PROVINCE. </p><p> </p><p>11.  CONTEMPORARY PAKISTANI TELEVISION ALSO LARGELY </p><p>REFLECTS THE RELIGIOUS RIGHT\'S IDEA OF "ISLAMIC" </p><p>BEHAVIOR AND ITS GROWING INFLUENCE.  CNN BROADCASTS </p><p>ARE HEAVILY CENSORED WITH SCENES OF WOMEN IN </p><p>"UN-ISLAMIC" DRESS OR EVEN OF MOTHERS KISSING THEIR </p><p>CHILDREN BLANKED OUT.  GUIDELINES FOR WOMEN\'S DRESS </p><p>IN DOMESTIC BROADCASTS WERE RECENTLY TIGHTENED, WITH </p><p>WOMEN NOW REQUIRED TO COVER THEIR HEADS REGARDLESS </p><p>OF THE TYPE OF CHARACTER THEY ARE PORTRAYING. </p><p>POSITIVE PORTRAYALS OF WOMEN IN NON-TRADITIONAL </p><p>ROLES ARE NEARLY NONEXISTENT.  DISCUSSION OF SUCH </p><p>ISSUES AS AIDS, BIRTH CONTROL, AND SEXUAL </p><p>HARRASSMENT IS RARE AND GENERAL, WITH AIDS IN </p><p>PARTICULAR OFTEN TIED TO "WESTERN BEHAVIOR" SUCH AS </p><p>THE "FREE MINGLING OF THE SEXES." </p><p> </p><p>12.  IN YET ANOTHER AREA, EDUCATION, THE GOP HAS </p><p>REGULARLY ACCEDED TO ISLAMIST PRESSURE TO INCREASE </p><p>THE ISLAMIC CONTENT OF THE EDUCATION SYSTEM. </p><p>LONG-STANDING LEGISLATION MANDATING ISLAMIC AND </p><p>QURANIC STUDIES FOR ALL MUSLIM STUDENTS HAS </p><p>REPEATEDLY BEEN REVISED TO INCREASE THE PERCENTAGE </p><p>OF TIME DEDICATED TO "ISLAMIA."  WHILE NON-MUSLIM </p><p>STUDENTS ARE EXEMPTED FROM ISLAMIC STUDIES, ALL </p><p>CIVIL SERVICE APPLICANTS--REGARDLESS OF FAITH--MUST </p><p>PASS ORAL AND WRITTEN EXAMS ON ISLAMIC STUDIES.  THE </p><p>WEIGHT GIVEN TO THIS SECTION WITHIN THE CIVIL </p><p>SERVICE EXAM HAS, MOREOVER, BEEN RAISED TO THE POINT </p><p>THAT MUSLIM CIVIL SERVICE APPLICANTS HAVE COMPLAINED </p><p>TO US THAT ISLAMIC ACTIVISTS HAVE AN UNFAIR </p><p>ADVANTAGE. </p><p> </p><p>13.  THE GOP IS ALSO UNDER GROWING ISLAMIST PRESSURE </p><p>TO ADD RELIGIOUS AFFILIATION TO THE INFORMATION </p><p>INCLUDED ON CITIZENS\' NATIONAL IDENTITY CARDS, WHICH </p><p>MUST BE PRESENTED BEFORE A PAKISTANI CAN LEGALLY </p><p>VOTE, APPLY FOR A JOB, BE ADMITTED TO UNIVERSITY, OR </p><p>ENTER MILITARY SERVICE. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>DEMOCRACY CHALLENGED: THEOCRATIC PRIMACY AHEAD? </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>14.  CONFRONTATION BETWEEN THE MODERNIST AND </p><p>ISLAMIST OUTLOOKS HAS BEEN SHARPEST IN REACTION TO </p><p>THE FEDERAL SHARIAT COURT\'S INCREASED ACTIVISM. </p><p>GENERAL ZIA CREATED THE SHARIAT COURT IN 1980 TO </p><p>BOLSTER HIS ISLAMIZATION CAMPAIGN, APPOINTING AND </p><p>FIRING JUDGES AT WILL TO ENSURE FAVORABLE VERDICTS. </p><p>SINCE ZIA\'S DEATH, HOWEVER, THE COURT HAS BEEN </p><p>STEERING A COLLISION COURSE WITH THE GOP.  RULINGS </p><p>SINCE JUNE 1990 INCLUDE: JUDGMENTS REPLACING CIVIL </p><p>PENAL CODES WITH AN "ISLAMIC" SYSTEM OF PUNISHMENTS; </p><p>A NOVEMBER 1991 SHARIAT COURT RULING DEFINING ALL </p><p>INTEREST PAYMENTS AS UN-ISLAMIC; AND A MAY 1992 </p><p>RULING UNDERCUTTING THE PROTECTIONS IN THE EXISTING </p><p>POLITICAL SYSTEM WHICH HAD BEEN A KEY FEATURE OF THE </p><p>SHARIA ACT AND A CHECK ON ISLAMIST EFFORTS TO </p><p>SUBORDINATE THE GOVERNMENT\'S LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY </p><p>TO THE MULLAHS.  THE GOP REPORTEDLY HAS NO INTENTION </p><p>OF IMPLEMENTING THESE JUDGMENTS, ALL OF WHICH REMAIN </p><p>FROZEN IN AN APPELLATE COURT.  TO DATE, HOWEVER, IT </p><p>HAS ALSO AVOIDED ANY ATTEMPT TO REIN IN THE SHARIAT </p><p>COURT. </p><p> </p><p>15.  MOST DISTURBING TO OBSERVERS, BUT SO FAR </p><p>UNDERPLAYED BY THE GOP, IS THE SHARIAT COURT\'S </p><p>CHALLENGE TO PAKISTAN\'S CURRENT PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM.  TECHNICALLY, THE COURT IS </p><p>CONSTITUTIONALLY BANNED FROM TOUCHING CONSTITUTIONAL </p><p>ISSUES AND COURT OFFICIALS ASSURE US THEY HAVE NO </p><p>INTENTION TO DO SO UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY THE </p><p>LEGISLATURE.  THE SHARIAT COURT\'S ASSERTIONS IN </p><p>RECENT RULINGS, HOWEVER, THAT MAN-MADE DOCUMENTS OR </p><p>HUMANLY-ELECTED PARLIAMENTS MUST BE SUBORDINATE TO </p><p>ISLAMIC LAW--AS INTERPRETED BY THE SHARIAT COURT-- </p><p>IMPLY JUST SUCH A WEAKENING OF THE CONSTITUTION\'S </p><p>INVIOLABILITY.  DURING A RECENT ISLAMABAD SEMINAR ON </p><p>ISLAMIZATION, RETIRED LAHORE HIGH COURT JUDGE JAVED </p><p>IQBAL DEFINED THE BASIC QUESTION AS ONE OF POWER. </p><p>"WHO HAS THE RIGHT TO REPRESENT THE WILL OF THE </p><p>PEOPLE, THEIR ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES OR JUDGES </p><p>APPOINTED BY THE PRESIDENT?"  IN IQBAL\'S VIEW, </p><p>PAKISTAN NOW HAS TWO INCOMPATIBLE SYSTEMS IN </p><p>OPERATION, ONE DEMOCRATIC AND ONE THEOCRATIC, </p><p>NEITHER ONE OF WHICH CAN WORK UNTIL THE GOP CHOOSES </p><p>BETWEEN THEM. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>16.  THE PRIMARY DANGER THAT THE RELIGIOUS RIGHT </p><p>REPRESENTS TO PAKISTAN IS THAT THEIR ACTIVITIES FUEL </p><p>THE FRAGMENTATION OF PAKISTANI SOCIETY.  THE TIES </p><p>THAT BIND TOGETHER PAKISTAN\'S MANY ETHNIC AND </p><p>RELIGIOUS GROUPS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN STRAINED TO SOME </p><p>DEGREE.  TOGETHER WITH MILITANT ETHNIC NATIONALIST </p><p>GROUPS, THE ISLAMIST PARTIES FURTHER SPLINTER </p><p>SOCIETY BY FEEDING THE PERCEPTION WITHIN EACH </p><p>COMMUNITY THAT IT IS UNDER SEIGE.  BATTLES BETWEEN </p><p>SECTARIAN GROUPS ARE THE MOST GRAPHIC RESULT. </p><p>EQUALLY, THE ISLAMISTS POSE A DIRECT THREAT TO </p><p>PAKISTAN\'S LONG-TERM INTERESTS, AS FEAR OF PROVOKING </p><p>THE RELIGIOUS RIGHT HAS CONSTRAINED THE THE GOP\'S </p><p>ABILITY TO ADDRESS KEY ISSUES -- WHETHER DOMESTIC, </p><p>SUCH AS EDUCATION AND BIRTH CONTROL, OR FOREIGN, </p><p>SUCH AS AFGHANISTAN AND KASHMIR. </p><p> </p><p>17.  WE DO NOT BELIEVE, HOWEVER, THAT PAKISTAN IS </p><p>HEADED FOR EITHER AN IRANIAN-STYLE ISLAMIC </p><p>REVOLUTION OR AN ALGERIAN-STYLE ISLAMIST VICTORY AT </p><p>THE POLLS.  THE ISLAMIST MOVEMENT IS TOO FRAGMENTED, </p><p>IDEOSYNCRATIC,  AND--WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE </p><p>HIGHLY CENTRALIZED JAMAAT-I-ISLAMI--FAR TOO </p><p>DISORGANIZED TO FORM A BROAD-BASED NATIONAL </p><p>MOVEMENT.  NO GROUP HAS YET DEMONSTRATED WIDESPREAD </p><p>PUBLIC SUPPORT AND THE POLITICO-RELIGIOUS LEADERS </p><p>THEMSELVES ARE POPULARLY VIEWED AS POWER-HUNGRY, </p><p>CORRUPT, AND PREOCCUPIED WITH THE PUNITIVE ASPECTS </p><p>OF ISLAM.  EXCEPT FOR A SLIGHT BOOST IN NATIONAL </p><p>ASSEMBLY SEATS IN 1990 DUE TO THE JAMAAT-I-ISLAMI\'S </p><p>MEMBERSHIP IN THE WINNING IJI COALITION, THE </p><p>ISLAMISTS\' SHARE OF THE POPULAR VOTE HAS DECLINED </p><p>WITH EVERY NATIONAL ELECTION SINCE THE CREATION OF </p><p>PAKISTAN. </p><p> </p><p>18.  THEIR LACK OF POPULAR SUPPORT AND ELECTORAL </p><p>STRENGTH WILL KEEP THE ISLAMISTS FROM POSING A </p><p>DIRECT POLITICAL THREAT TO THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT. </p><p>THE SYMBOLIC AND EMOTIONAL VALUE OF THE "ISLAMIC" </p><p>CALL, HOWEVER, AND THE COMMITMENT OF THE ISLAMISTS\' </p><p>MORE MILITANT SUPPORTERS, MAKES THEM A POTENTIAL </p><p>SOURCE OF TROUBLE.  IN SUM, WE ANTICIPATE A </p><p>CONTINUING STRUGGLE BETWEEN MODERNISTS AND ISLAMISTS </p><p>TO DETERMINE THE SHAPE OF PAKISTANI SOCIETY IN THE </p><p>MONTHS AHEAD.  THE GOVERNMENT MEANWHILE WALKS A FINE </p><p>LINE, WORRIED ABOUT THE RELGIOUS RIGHT\'S ABILITY TO </p><p>TO CREATE PROBLEMS IN THE STREETS, BUT EQUALLY AWARE </p><p>OF THE THREAT TO THE NATION\'S SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC </p><p>DEVELOPMENT IF THE ISLAMISTS ADVANCE THEIR AGENDA </p><p>UNCHECKED. </p><p> </p><p>19.  THIS REPORT IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE </p><p>MISSION REPORTING PLAN. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PLATT </p><p></p></div>
