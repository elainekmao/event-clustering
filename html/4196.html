<p>UNCLAS AMMAN 006469 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARN AND EB - BOB BOYNTON </p><p>STATE PASS USTR FOR NED SAUMS AND DOUG BELL </p><p>STATE PASS USAID FOR TOM OLIVER </p><p>USDOC FOR 4520/ITA/MAC/ONE/P.THANOS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KTEX, ETRD, EINV, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: TEXTILE DIVERSIFICATION CHALLENGES IN JORDAN </p><p> </p><p>REF: SECSTATE 160692 </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but unclassified; please protect accordingly. </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Embassy Econ staff and USAID Jordan have maintained </p><p>an extensive and productive dialogue with Jordan\'s </p><p>government and private sector along the lines of reftel </p><p>recommendations since the inception of the QIZ initiative </p><p>in 1998.  The GOJ in particular is eager to see Jordan\'s </p><p>industrial base expand and diversify, recognizing that </p><p>tying too great a percentage of the kingdom\'s growth and </p><p>employment to one sector would be imprudent. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) The GOJ, in partnership with key players in Jordan\'s </p><p>private sector and with the support of the Mission, has </p><p>worked particularly hard over the past ten months to </p><p>maximize the potential benefits of the U.S.-Jordan Free </p><p>Trade Agreement.  As highlighted reftel, JUSBP\'s Export </p><p>Fast Track Action Plan (EFTAP) has already helped develop </p><p>Jordanian export capacity in a wide range of industries </p><p>including marble and stone, air conditioning units, paper </p><p>products, and cosmetics.  JUSBP is also working actively </p><p>with Jordanian companies in specialty foods, olive oil, and </p><p>grain processing.  That said, Jordan maintains a strong </p><p>interest in sustaining its nascent textile sector in a </p><p>competitive global market through bolstering the sector\'s </p><p>competitiveness. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) One such mechanism to do so is TRIDE (Trilateral </p><p>Industrial Development), a program utilizing U.S., Israeli, </p><p>and Jordanian funds to jointly develop industrial R&D </p><p>projects.  TRIDE could help Jordanian companies explore and </p><p>develop new technologies.  In fact, two TRIDE success </p><p>stories were the development of an Arabic software program </p><p>and a network management solution. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) The GOJ and private sector are aware of TDA and </p><p>OPIC facilities.  TDA has been utilized here with some </p><p>success, including most recently to carry out a feasibility </p><p>study for an independent power project in the kingdom. </p><p>Jordan\'s experience with OPIC has been unimpressive to </p><p>date, due in large part to a local management team that </p><p>lacks motivation.  OPIC managers from the U.S. are </p><p>reviewing the program here, and we expect the OPIC facility </p><p>to become more robust in the coming months - a development </p><p>that will be welcome to a Jordanian government keen on </p><p>attracting new investment. </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
