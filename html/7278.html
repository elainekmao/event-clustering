<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 002155 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARN, NEA/PA, NEA/AIA, INR/NESA, R/MR, </p><p>I/GNEA, B/BXN, B/BRN, NEA/PPD, NEA/IPA FOR ALTERMAN </p><p>USAID/ANE/MEA </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH </p><p>PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p> </p><p>TAGS: KMDR JO </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON WAR IN IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>                        Summary </p><p> </p><p>-- Papers published today, April 9, are almost </p><p>entirely dedicated to coverage of and reaction to the </p><p>death of Al-Jazeera TV reporter, Tareq Ayyoub, a </p><p>Jordanian, and other reporters yesterday as a result </p><p>of fighting in Baghdad.  Ayyoub is portrayed as a </p><p>"martyr of the search for truth" and "a victim of </p><p>American brutality that wants to silence witnesses to </p><p>American and British crimes against Iraq and the Iraqi </p><p>people."  Strongly worded headlines and commentaries </p><p>describe the reporters\' deaths as a "massacre", such </p><p>Al-Arab Al-Yawm\'s headline, which reads: "The Invaders </p><p>Execute a Massacre Against Witnesses in Baghdad". </p><p>Strongly-worded commentaries condemn Ayyoub\'s </p><p>"killing" and say that his "blood is on the hands of </p><p>the invaders". </p><p> </p><p>                 Editorial Commentary </p><p> </p><p>-- "A crime in Baghdad" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Nahed Hattar writes on the op-ed page </p><p>of independent, mass-appeal Arabic daily Al-Arab Al- </p><p>Yawm (04/09):  "The Americans are going to pay a </p><p>political price for committing the murder of our </p><p>colleague, the martyr Tareq Ayyoub.  All efforts </p><p>exerted by the American Embassy in Amman to establish </p><p>relations with Jordanian journalists died with the </p><p>death of Tareq.  The martyrdom of Tareq Ayyoub is a </p><p>heinous crime against Jordanian journalists.  The </p><p>American invaders have outdone the Nazis and the </p><p>Zionists by cowardly targeting representatives of the </p><p>Arab and international media in Baghdad.  Is it enough </p><p>to say that it is a flagrant and barbaric violation of </p><p>international accords that ban the targeting of the </p><p>media during wars?  And yet, this aggressive and </p><p>colonialist war was launched in the first place out of </p><p>a clear violation of international legitimacy and of </p><p>the right-wing recklessness with international and </p><p>Arab public opinion." </p><p> </p><p>-- "Tareq Ayyoub: a martyr of the battle of Baghdad" </p><p> </p><p>Chief Editor Taher Udwan writes on the back page of </p><p>independent, mass-appeal Arabic daily Al-Arab Al-Yawm </p><p>(04/09):  "The martyrdom of colleague Tareq Ayyoub </p><p>confirms the fact that the media is not neutral, and </p><p>that, particularly in this war, should not be.  Tareq </p><p>Ayyoub, the correspondents of Al-Jazeera and other </p><p>Arab satellite stations in Baghdad, are enemies in the </p><p>eyes of the invading forces, because they are Arabs </p><p>and because the public opinion that they belong to and </p><p>seek to address is an Arab public opinion..  The fall </p><p>of Tareq Ayyoub as a martyr at the hands of the </p><p>invading forces must push Arab media representatives </p><p>and the representatives of Arab satellite stations to </p><p>take the side of their nation and of the blood of the </p><p>martyrs of this nation.  Baghdad today is not much </p><p>different from Ramallah or Gaza or Hebron or Jenin or </p><p>Nablus when they fall under the fire of Israeli </p><p>bombing.  Just as Arab journalists and media </p><p>professionals who belong to their nation and their </p><p>doctrines must not stand `neutral or objective\' when </p><p>covering the crimes of the Israeli occupation in the </p><p>West Bank and Gaza, this `neutrality or objectivity\' </p><p>would neither be understood nor accepted when in it </p><p>comes to covering the crimes of a foreign invasion of </p><p>an Arab country, so that an American General can rule </p><p>and lays the foundation for an American-Zionist empire </p><p>over the lands of Arab and Islam." </p><p> </p><p>-- "Tareq\'s blood is on the hands of the invaders" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Urayb Rintawi writes on the op-ed page </p><p>of center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(04/09):  "The blood of Tareq Ayyoub, who fell a </p><p>martyr yesterday, is on the hands of the leaders of </p><p>the coalition in London and Washington.  No words of </p><p>sorrow or apology will do, not ready-made accusations </p><p>that try to acquit those responsible for his blood or </p><p>the blood of hundreds of Iraqis who fell victims by </p><p>the bullets of guns and by the shrapnel of the </p><p>American missile attacks all around Iraq." </p><p> </p><p>-- "The enemies of the press, the enemies of the truth </p><p>and Tareq Ayyoub, the symbol of the noble profession" </p><p> </p><p>Semi-official, influential Arabic daily Al-Rai (04/09) </p><p>editorializes:  "We did not need all this terror, </p><p>targeting and recklessness with which the reporters </p><p>covering the American-British invasion of Baghdad were </p><p>faced, to prove that the invaders have had it with the </p><p>media, apart, of course, from that media that is with </p><p>them, who abide by their strict and programmed </p><p>instructions..  For the killers to say that they were </p><p>shot at from the Palestine hotel that was targeted by </p><p>the bombing, while all the journalists were denying </p><p>that, is a mark of shame to be added to disgrace that </p><p>they afflicted upon themselves when they shed the </p><p>blood of innocent media people." </p><p> </p><p>-- "Tareq Ayyoub: your role harassed them and so they </p><p>killed you" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Sultan Hattab writes on the op-ed page </p><p>of semi-official, influential Arabic daily Al-Rai </p><p>(04/09):  "Killing our colleague Tareq Ayyoub is a </p><p>clear message against the new changes in the Arab </p><p>media that are represented by the active Arab </p><p>satellite stations, such as Al-Jazeera and Abu Dhabi </p><p>TVs.  What Tareq Ayyoub said in his last report from </p><p>Baghdad was sufficient for the circles of American </p><p>aggression to kill him..  Tareq exposed them and so </p><p>they killed him, because whoever is not with them is </p><p>their enemy.  Bush said that and now his forces are </p><p>saying it too." </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
