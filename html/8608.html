<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 COLOMBO 001008 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>Department for D (Gastright), INR/MR, I/RW, I/REC, </p><p>SA (CAPM, WALLER), SA/PD (BRENNIG, IRWIN, SCENSNY), </p><p>SSA/PAS; SSO (PASS TO D);  TOKYO (Hara, Bryan) </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, OPRC, KMDR, OIIP, CE, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  MEDIA PLAY: (JUNE 10) Tokyo Conference: Colombo </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary.  Tamil newspapers reserved pride of place for </p><p>optimistic headlines about an interim administration and the </p><p>future of the peace talks.  Donor money and international </p><p>support of the peace process were also well-represented </p><p>subjects.  English and vernacular government-owned and </p><p>independent media echoed these themes.  Even the opposition </p><p>newspapers were unusually sunny, Editorials were </p><p>apprehensive about how donor money will be spent and </p><p>cautioned, "..peace will be secured only in democracy."  End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>2. LTTE statements and other Tamil reaction. </p><p>----- </p><p>Tamil newspapers reserved pride of place for optimistic </p><p>headlines about an interim administration and the future of </p><p>the peace talks.  All major dailies relayed Prime Minister </p><p>Ranil Wickremesinghe\'s remarks in their lead stories. </p><p>Independent daily VIRAKESARI quoted, "Development work in </p><p>the north through provisional administrative structure - </p><p>participation of the Tigers assured," while state-owned </p><p>daily THINAKARAN added, ".will amend the constitution once </p><p>[they] reach a solution."  Independent daily THINAKKURAL </p><p>enthused, "Next stage of peace efforts started." </p><p> </p><p>As always, Tamil media was detail-oriented - in this case - </p><p>about the money.  Pro-LTTE SUDAR OLI wrote, "Expected USD 3 </p><p>billion, received USD 4 billion at the Tokyo Conference - </p><p>Period extended from three to four years."  Independent </p><p>daily VIRAKESARI sealed the deal,  "Japanese Representatives </p><p>will visit Kilinochchi next week and inform Tigers </p><p>officially about the aid received." </p><p> </p><p>Surprisingly, pro-LTTE SUDAR OLI quoted Minister of Muslim </p><p>Religious Affairs Rauf Hakeem,  "Tokyo Conference a victory </p><p>to Muslims," state-owned THINAKARAN quoted him as well, "All </p><p>communities benefit by development through peace." </p><p> </p><p>International support of the peace process was well </p><p>represented in the Tamil dailies.  Independent daily </p><p>VIRAKESARI quoted Deputy Secretary Armitage, "President </p><p>should inform the international community about her support </p><p>towards peace efforts.  Independent daily THINAKKURAL did </p><p>the same, "The US is ready to point out the duties of the </p><p>Tigers to obtain official recognition - Break of talks, </p><p>unimaginable," and quotes the conference host, "Japan </p><p>requests LTTE to return to peace talks ASAP." </p><p> </p><p>Under the headline, "Armitage addresses Sri Lanka donors\' </p><p>conference, pro-LTTE TamilNet ran a transcript of the Deputy </p><p>Secretary\'s opening remarks in Tokyo.  The introductory </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>quote is below. </p><p> </p><p>Block  quote. </p><p> </p><p>Noting that the momentum of the Sri Lanka peace process is </p><p>slowing, US Deputy Secretary of State Armitage said the </p><p>international community needs to provide an infusion of </p><p>moral and material support to move the parties and the </p><p>process forward when he addressed the Sri Lanka donors\' </p><p>conference in Japan, Monday. But, he said, "no matter how </p><p>much we pledge at this conference, it is ultimately the </p><p>prime minister, the president of Sri Lanka, members of the </p><p>LTTE, and most importantly of all the people of Sri Lanka, </p><p>who will have to deliver on the promise of peace." </p><p> </p><p>End block quote. </p><p> </p><p>Tamil editorialists did not address Tokyo directly.  Marking </p><p>World Environment Day, the pro-LTTE SUDAR OLI editorial page </p><p>headlined, "With reconstruction, a better environment is </p><p>also necessary," and commented,  "The aid given by the </p><p>international community is required only for the </p><p>reconstruction and rehabilitation work. The protection of </p><p>environment is in the hands of all people. If the </p><p>environment is polluted there\'s no prosperity."  Independent </p><p>daily THINAKKURAL\'s editorial, "Japanese Prime Minister\'s </p><p>concern," chronicled his comments, and summarized, "The </p><p>international community is anxiously awaiting the dawn of </p><p>peace, ending the conflict in Sri Lanka. The peace </p><p>negotiations, started by President Chandrika Kumaratunga, </p><p>are being carried forward by the Prime Minister with the </p><p>support of the people.  The day peace will dawn, fulfilling </p><p>the expectation of people and the international community, </p><p>is not far away.  The peace efforts in Sri Lanka should end </p><p>up victorious and be model to the whole world." </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>3. GSL statements and pro-government reaction. </p><p>----- </p><p>State-owned television and radio stations\' English and </p><p>vernacular coverage of the Tokyo Conference was heavy, and </p><p>included stories about unexpectedly large donor pledges and </p><p>the participation of more than 50 countries and 20 financial </p><p>institutions.  International requests for the LTTE to return </p><p>to the negotiating table also figured prominently, </p><p>particularly Deputy Secretary Armitage\'s remarks to the </p><p>Conference. </p><p>State-owned newspapers focused on donor money and </p><p>international exhortations for the LTTE to return to the </p><p>peace talks.   State-owned Sinhala daily DINAMINA </p><p>"Assistance pledged for PM\'s programs on Reawakening Sri </p><p>Lanka and peace; (Rs) Kouti 40000 [US $4 billion] for Sri </p><p>Lanka - Highest financial assistance so far."  State-owned </p><p>English DAILY NEWS reported, "Prove commitment to negotiated </p><p>settlement, Armitage tells LTTE," and "LTTE should return to </p><p>talks - Japanese PM." </p><p> </p><p>Concern about the domestic front also surfaced in government- </p><p>sympathetic headlines.  State-owned English DAILY NEWS </p><p>reassured, "Govt. will continue efforts to bring lasting </p><p>peace - PM," while state-owned Sinhala daily DINAMINA </p><p>observed, "People in the north blame the LTTE for not going </p><p>to the Japan confab." </p><p>ED: Approaches to development dominated the editorial pages </p><p>of the state-owned English daily.  The state-owned Sinhala </p><p>daily editorialized about the threat to peace killings in </p><p>the north pose. </p><p>--- Under the headline, "The challenges ahead," state-owned </p><p>English DAILY NEWS comments, that a ""bottom-up" approach" </p><p>to development, "would enable a fuller fleshing out of </p><p>development plans and ensure a more sensitive response from </p><p>the State to the people\'s needs." </p><p>Block quotes. </p><p>However, the process of economic rejuvenation is not going </p><p>to prove easy, and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe was frank </p><p>enough to recognize this reality. </p><p>It was also recognized that although development needed to </p><p>be put on a fast track, our public service was too large, </p><p>poorly paid and lacks the capacity to handle the increased </p><p>rates of project design and implementation. </p><p>We believe we are blessed with sufficient local expertise </p><p>for these major projects, although their capacity for </p><p>handling these challenges may need to be upgraded and </p><p>enhanced. This, the State may need to concern itself with </p><p>rightaway. A skills and capacity upgrading program for these </p><p>exercises we consider an essential requirement. </p><p>Besides, there needs to be closer interaction between the </p><p>grass roots masses, their organisations and the State and </p><p>its agencies for a comprehensive push towards development. </p><p>It is widely felt that the approach which is dominating on </p><p>the development front right now, is a "top-down" one which </p><p>could lose sight of the real needs of the people. </p><p>On the other hand, a "bottom-up" approach would enable a </p><p>fuller fleshing out of development plans and ensure a more </p><p>sensitive response from the State to the people\'s needs. </p><p>End block quotes. </p><p>--- In a rare business page editorial, "Using Tokyo funds </p><p>prudently," state-owned DAILY NEWS commented, "The </p><p>government\'s implementing agencies should work closely with </p><p>business chambers and key players in the private sector in </p><p>formulating development plans that use the Tokyo funds. </p><p>Their input will be valuable in identifying and designing </p><p>projects that could propel Sri Lanka ahead of its regional </p><p>competitors." </p><p>----Under the headline,"` Killings in the north- a threat to </p><p>peace," state-owned Sinhala daily DINAMINA commented, "There </p><p>have been so many violations of the MOU in the past period. </p><p>America and other countries sternly advised the LTTE quite a </p><p>few times to renounce terrorism. Whether in or outside </p><p>Tokyo, the LTTE will have to face allegations on human </p><p>rights violations.  They have to accept the basic principles </p><p>of democracy.  We condemn these ruthless killings and wish </p><p>to state that peace will be secured only in democracy." </p><p> </p><p>---- </p><p>4. Opposition statements and pro-opposition reaction. </p><p>----- </p><p>Opposition newspapers offered many of the same stories as </p><p>the Tamil and state-owned press.  The independent, but </p><p>nationalist-leaning, ISLAND and Sinhala sister paper DIVAINA </p><p>were unusually conciliatory in their coverage of an interim </p><p>administration.  DIVAINA wrote, "LTTE and the GSL are not </p><p>poles apart in their views on an interim administration, </p><p>while the ISLAND quoted Prime Minister Wickremesinghe, "To </p><p>facilitate normalcy in civil life north and east should be </p><p>given an interim administration." </p><p>Under the headline, "LTTE, JVP and democracy,"  independent, </p><p>but nationalist-leaning, English daily ISLAND criticized the </p><p>international community for legitimizing Prabakaran\'s </p><p>leadership of the LTTE,  and "is acting in a manner which is </p><p>suggestive that it has accepted the terror outfit as the </p><p>sole representative of the Tamils." </p><p>Block quotes. </p><p>Today the JVP has, no doubt, realised that democracy is much </p><p>more rewarding than terror: It has won 16 seats in </p><p>Parliament and a large number seats in provincial councils </p><p>and local government bodies. Lo and behold! It is </p><p>campaigning against terrorism today. </p><p>Why the JVP was not amenable to a negotiated settlement </p><p>during its heyday of terror was its intransigence, which </p><p>stemmed from the obduracy of its leadership. Hadn\'t the JVP </p><p>leadership come to perish, the situation would have been </p><p>different today. </p><p>Likewise so long as Prabhakaran remains the `supreme leader\' </p><p>the LTTE\'s intransigence which is blocking the path to </p><p>negotiations let alone peace will be insurmountable. </p><p>It is strange that the international community, which is </p><p>pontificating on the virtues of tolerance of dissent, </p><p>internal democracy and a host of other democratic principles </p><p>and has given full cry to regime change in \'rogue states\' </p><p>has taken for granted the LTTE leadership and its ruthless </p><p>suppression of democracy and is acting in a manner which is </p><p>suggestive that it has accepted the terror outfit as the </p><p>sole representative of the Tamils. </p><p>Hypocrisy of the so-called international community </p><p>notwithstanding, the irony is that when the `doves\' try to </p><p>counter the JVP campaign against the peace process by asking </p><p>them if they could enter democratic politics despite an ugly </p><p>past why can\'t the LTTE do so, they unwittingly support the </p><p>cry of the anti-terror activists for countering LTTE </p><p>terrorism in the same manner as that of the JVP. </p><p>End block quotes. </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>5. Independent media reaction </p><p>----- </p><p> Independent television and radio stories about Tokyo </p><p>focused on donor money and international support of the </p><p>peace process.  Independent newspapers followed suit. </p><p>Independent English DAILY MIRROR headlined, "\'I will never </p><p>give up on peace\': PM - Expresses appreciation of </p><p>significant role by President," and reported, "US strongly </p><p>urges LTTE to return to talks."  Independent Sinhala daily </p><p>LANKADEEPA observed, "`Promised funds will come only </p><p>according to the progress of peace talks\'-says Japan PM and </p><p>asks LTTE to come to negotiations."  The DAILY MIRROR\'s </p><p>business page headlined, "ADB points to effective, quick aid </p><p>utilization - Flood of donor support for peace and growth at </p><p>Tokyo boosts Sri Lanka\'s profile internationally." </p><p> </p><p>AMSELEM </p><p></p></div>
