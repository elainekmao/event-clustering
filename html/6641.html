(S/NF)  Begin Summary:  The Ambassador convened two </p><p>Emergency Action Committee (EAC) meetings on March 21.  At </p><p>1400, EAC met to assess threat information in light of </p><p>developments with the Iraq contingency and a developing </p><p>demonstration.  At 1830, EAC met to discuss Embassy response </p><p>to the violent demonstration near the Embassy that left </p><p>several demonstrators and security forces dead and injured </p><p>(ref a).  Internal defense measures are in place, including </p><p>standing a 24/7 watch using RSO-directed Embassy elements </p><p>with agreed-upon rules of engagement.  At 1915 Ambassador </p><p>discussed the situation with President Saleh, offering </p><p>condolences and appreciation for security provided, asking </p><p>for further enhancements and suggesting that Saleh might </p><p>issue a public statement urging non-violence.  Saleh is </p><p>convening a security meeting immediately and will respond on </p><p>specific enhancements for security.  More demonstrations are </p><p>expected March 22.  Key offices and personnel represented at </p><p>the meeting included: AMB, DCM, POL/ECON, CONS, ADMIN, PD, </p><p>RSO, ORCA, OMC, SOC YEMEN and RMO. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>Demonstration Near Embassy Turns Violent </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S/NF)  A demonstration at Sheraton Circle near the </p><p>Embassy turned violent, leaving several dead (ref a).  By </p><p>1800 local, ROYG and Embassy security called an all clear. </p><p>SOC said Central Security Organization (CSO) reported two </p><p>officers killed and four critically wounded.  DAO sources </p><p>reported three demonstrators killed and 14 injured.  Media </p><p>reports on deaths and injuries vary.  Al Jazeera and Yemeni </p><p>television reported the death of a 12 year old boy during the </p><p>demonstration. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S/NF)  ORCA reported that the hard-core demonstrators </p><p>who remained to clash with the security forces were in two </p><p>main groups, one with approximately 400 persons and one with </p><p>approximately 250.  ROYG elements reported approximately 800 </p><p>in total. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (S/NF)  In response to rumours at 1845, RSO spoke to MOI </p><p>to dispatch CSO forces to deal with an alleged mob of </p><p>demonstrators who had gathered at the Sanaa International </p><p>School (SIS), which is currently closed.  The rumors proved </p><p>unfounded. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (S/NF)  DAO reported that evening mosque sermons were </p><p>calling for additional protests and stoking the emotions of </p><p>worshippers.  Demonstrators are planning to return to the </p><p>Embassy March 22. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (S/NF)  The YALI teacher and stringer for Associated </p><p>Press who was detained by military intelligence at the </p><p>demonstration was taken to the Embassy pending a safe time to </p><p>get him home via armored vehicle. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>Embassy Response </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (S/NF)  Internal defense measures were put in place to </p><p>ensure wide security coverage and adequate response.  The </p><p>plan included a floor-by-floor approach by MSG and other </p><p>augmentees for defense of the chancery.  24/7 watchstanding </p><p>began at 1930, with personnel on the roofs of both the </p><p>chancery and the residence.  Rules of Engagement have been </p><p>agreed, to include clear command and control under RSO, </p><p>watchstanders in body armor and armed and use of lethal force </p><p>only with RSO (and COM) direction or in self-defense or in </p><p>defense of American life. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (S/NF)  EAC discussed concern that the Sheraton Hotel </p><p>could become a target in future demonstrations, although it </p><p>was not a target at the 3/21 demonstration.  EAC decided not </p><p>to remove to the Embassy the 15-20 Embassy personnel on </p><p>StandFast at the Sheraton.  Rather, they will be moved in </p><p>armored vehicles as soon as the Embassy hears a demonstration </p><p>might be forming anywhere in Sanaa.  Embassy personnel on </p><p>StandFast at their residences and the ACC will remain because </p><p>they live far from the Embassy and are not in high </p><p>concentrations. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (S/NF)  EAC suggested another radio message be </p><p>disseminated to provide further information on the </p><p>demonstration and advise them to remain at StandFast. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (S/NF)  PAO reported that press guidance is being </p><p>cleared through Washington and that requests were received </p><p>for interviews about the demonstration, which he declined. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>President Saleh Promises Continued Security </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  (S/NF)  Ambassador spoke with President Saleh by phone. </p><p>Ambassador offered regret for the Yemenis killed and injured, </p><p>particularly security forces.  He told Saleh that he </p><p>appreciated the protection provided and suggested that </p><p>further enhancements of security measures for Embassy and </p><p>Amcits should be discussed.  Ambassador also suggested it </p><p>would be helpful for President Saleh to make a statement </p><p>discouraging violence and turning efforts towards </p><p>humanitarian assistance to the Iraqi people, similar to </p><p>statements made in Morocco and soon in Jordan. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (S/NF)  The Presidency phoned again and told the </p><p>Ambassador that Saleh appreciated the Ambassador\'s points and </p><p>is convening immediately a security meeting to go over </p><p>contingencies.  The President will be in touch with specific </p><p>enhancements. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>Other Threats and Security Issues; </p><p>Marib Incident </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  (S/NF)  ORCA reported no change in current threat </p><p>information beyond the demonstrations.  ORCA reported on </p><p>ongoing discussions with PSO regarding Iraqis.  EAC discussed </p><p>developments and upcoming actions in the Iraq war and </p><p>worldwide televised demonstrations in regards to their effect </p><p>on the situation in Sanaa. </p><p> </p><p>15.  (S)  The list of Americans for the MOI for protection </p><p>continues to be worked. </p><p> </p><p>16.  (S/NF)  The investigation into the Marib incident </p><p>continued and no concrete evidence for a motive -- political </p><p>or otherwise -- has been found (ref b).  Because of the </p><p>violent demonstrations, a planned trip by FBI and FPD to </p><p>Marib to join the autopsy of the killer was cancelled. </p><p>HULL </p><p></p></div>
