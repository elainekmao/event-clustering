NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR T. PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/07/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MDC OFFICIAL OFFERS MIXED ASSESSMENT ON CHURCHES\' </p><p>INITIATIVE, SEEKS APPROACH TO MILITARY </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) HARARE 1571 (B) HARARE 1532 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: POLITICAL OFFICER WIN DAYTON; REASON 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  Gandhi Mudzingwa, MDC\'s Director of </p><p>Presidential Affairs, on August 7 told poloff that mixed </p><p>signals from ZANU-PF underscored the uncertainty surrounding </p><p>the ongoing bishops\' attempt to jump start talks.  He </p><p>reported that a ZANU-PF source had approached him about </p><p>derailing the effort but that Mugabe\'s attitude on the talks </p><p>remained unclear.  Emphasizing the potential importance of </p><p>the military in any resolution of Zimbabwe\'s political </p><p>impasse, he signalled that the MDC would embark on a discreet </p><p>effort to engage key military figures.  He urged the USG to </p><p>engage moderate ZANU-PF elements and to maintain pressure on </p><p>South Africa to push Mugabe to the table.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Mudzingwa opened by expressing dismay over ZANU-PF\'s </p><p>failure to demonstrate clear commitment to the process </p><p>undertaken by the bishops (ref B), which he attributed to a </p><p>clash of "personal interests" among key insiders.  A nephew </p><p>of Speaker of Parliament Emmerson Mnangagwa called Mudzingwa </p><p>on August 6 to urge that the bishops\' initiative be </p><p>terminated, noting that Justice Minister Patrick Chinamasa </p><p>and Information Minister Jonathan Moyo had convinced the </p><p>party that the bishops were not impartial.  Mudzingwa </p><p>observed that Mnangagwa, who remains Mugabe\'s favored </p><p>successor, was not involved in any of the intra-party </p><p>initiatives to communicate with the MDC and was likely to be </p><p>an obstacle to all such initiatives.  Others posturing in the </p><p>run-up to potential negotiations, such as Chinamasa and </p><p>Information Secretary Nathan Shamuyarira, were seeking to </p><p>discredit each others\' efforts in an effort maximize each\'s </p><p>own influence.  He concluded that most accepted the need for </p><p>dialogue and change but ego clashes and mutual suspicion </p><p>thwarted their ability to pursue an obvious shared interest </p><p>in meaningful engagement. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Tempering his pessimism, Mudzingwa opined that Mugabe </p><p>himself may yet be open to the bishops\' process </p><p>notwithstanding the squabbling and lack of consensus among </p><p>his subordinates.  Mugabe repeatedly had made clear through </p><p>public signals and private communications that he wanted to </p><p>step down; if he believed that the bishops\'s process could </p><p>produce the conditions he required to step down, the </p><p>initiative could still bear fruit.  Mudzingwa detected signs </p><p>that Mugabe remained open to some kind of constructive </p><p>engagement with the MDC.  ZANU-PF public characterizations of </p><p>the MDC were becoming more restrained.  The cabinet (read: </p><p>Mugabe) reportedly had required Local Government Minister </p><p>Chombo to suspend his effort to have the MDC-dominated Harare </p><p>City Council dismissed.  The country\'s downward economic </p><p>spiral, buttressed by international pressure, had convinced </p><p>most ZANU-PF members from top to bottom that significant </p><p>change was necessary.  Prominent members\' posturing, while </p><p>disruptive, evidenced their conviction that change would come </p><p>and that they wanted to shape it.  Nonetheless, the talks, if </p><p>undertaken, were unlikely to go anywhere without the thorny </p><p>issue of Mugabe\'s succession within ZANU-PF first being </p><p>resolved. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Mudzingwa confided that the MDC had no contingency </p><p>plans to pursue in the event that efforts to get ZANU-PF to </p><p>the table failed.  The MDC had yet to become very proficient </p><p>at planning, something at which ZANU-PF always had excelled, </p><p>he conceded.  The MDC remained highly vulnerable on the </p><p>breadth of their leadership.  Although the MDC had wide </p><p>popular support, Mudzingwa asserted, it lacked anybody beyond </p><p>Morgan Tsvangirai who had the stature to command a national </p><p>following.  Like ZANU-PF, the MDC had no clear succession </p><p>mechanism. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Characterizing the military as Mugabe\'s "final </p><p>reliable pillar of support", Mudzingwa emphasized its </p><p>potential importance in any political solution to the </p><p>country\'s crisis.  The MDC had yet to establish rapport with </p><p>any key military leaders, even though many were deeply </p><p>dissatisfied with the current situation and supported change. </p><p> Mudzingwa said he intended discreetly to reach out to some, </p><p>more to reassure them about the MDC\'s posture toward the </p><p>military than to seek their support.  He urged the USG </p><p>quietly to get the military to understand the need for </p><p>national political dialogue and to reassure key officials </p><p>about potential MDC governance.  He said he intended to seek </p><p>similar engagement by South African officials but thought the </p><p>USG might offer "more muscle". </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) In closing, Mudzingwa conveyed gratitude for the many </p><p>facets of USG support for potential change in Zimbabwe.  He </p><p>urged the USG to maintain pressure on South Africa to push </p><p>Mugabe to the table.  The USG should "recognize" the bishops </p><p>effort discreetly, being careful not to so in a way that </p><p>might give ZANU-PF elements more fodder with which to </p><p>discredit them.  Finally, Mudzingwa advised the USG to engage </p><p>with moderate ZANU-PF elements such as Shamuyarira and </p><p>Chairman John Nkomo, and those with strong ties to the </p><p>business community, such as Matumwa Mawere and Saviour </p><p>Kasukawire. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) COMMENT:  The bishops\' initiative continues to </p><p>proceed on shaky ground.  The timing and substance of </p><p>ZANU-PF\'s overdue contribution to the talks\' agenda may be a </p><p>significant indicator of Mugabe\'s interest, the decisive </p><p>factor in whether talks begin.  Regarding its interest in </p><p>reassuring the military, the MDC does not appear to have a </p><p>policy for dealing with top military figures; an MDC approach </p><p>to the military could alarm ZANU-PF elements and further </p><p>disrupt nascent progress toward talks.  Bishop Evangelical </p><p>Fellowship of Zimbabwe President Trevor Manhanga\'s meeting </p><p>with the Charge on August 8 is reported septel. </p><p>WHITEHEAD </p><p></p></div>
