<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 006309 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/29/2007 </p><p>TAGS: ASEC, PTER, PREL, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: ASSASSINATION OF U.S. DIPLOMAT IN AMMAN: STATUS AS </p><p>OF NOON LOCAL 10/29 </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) AMMAN 6282 (B) AMMAN 6265 (C) AMMAN 6261 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM Gregory L. Berry.  Reasons 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Twenty four hours after the brutal murder of USAID </p><p>employee Larry Foley, the GOJ continues to provide excellent </p><p>cooperation in the investigation of the attack and in </p><p>implementing new security measures to protect the American </p><p>community.  At the political level, numerous senior GOJ </p><p>officials (the King, PM, FM, Minister of Interior, Minister </p><p>of Planning, and others) have made public statements strongly </p><p>condemning the attack, reaffirming Jordan\'s close </p><p>relationship with the U.S., and vowing to do all they can to </p><p>find the perpetrator(s) and bring him/them to justice. </p><p>Jordan\'s largest opposition party -- The Islamic Action Front </p><p>-- also condemned the attack stating "our condemnation of </p><p>U.S. policies does not mean that we sanction murder."  A </p><p>common theme in today\'s press and in conversations with </p><p>contacts has been that this was an attack as much on Jordan </p><p>as it was on the U.S., and that it was intended to sow </p><p>instability in the Kingdom.  Alongside this as well have been </p><p>expressions of shame and anger that Jordan\'s tradition of </p><p>gracious hospitality to guests has been assaulted. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Investigation: Both the GID and PSD continue to work </p><p>the case hard and are devoting extensive resources to finding </p><p>the perpetrators.  A two-person DS Protective Intelligence </p><p>Investigative (PII) team is scheduled to arrive in Amman from </p><p>Washington this evening (10/29) to assist in the </p><p>investigation.  The London-based Arabic-language daily </p><p>"al-Quds al-Arabi" reported on 10/29 that it had received a </p><p>statement from a group called "Shurafa al-Urdun" (Honorables </p><p>or Nobles of Jordan) claiming responsibility for the attack. </p><p>The same group had claimed responsibility for the murder of </p><p>an Israeli businessman in Amman in August 2001. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Security: The RSO is working with the Jordanian </p><p>security services on providing increased security in our </p><p>residential areas.  Police worked with RSO staff throughout </p><p>Tuesday night (10/28-10/29) identifying residences and </p><p>preparing plans on how best to provide a higher level of </p><p>security.  Police coverage will consist of a combination of </p><p>marked and unmarked units, static positions, and foot patrols </p><p>which will work in the close vicinity of all Embassy </p><p>residences.  The Embassy mobile patrols will continue their </p><p>24-hour checks of residences.  Two Regional RSO TDYers are </p><p>scheduled to arrive in Amman on 10/29 to assist in </p><p>implementing our increased security posture. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) King Abdullah\'s Condolence Call to Virginia Foley and </p><p>Embassy Memorial Service:  The King is scheduled to come to </p><p>the Ambassador\'s residence early afternoon of October 29 to </p><p>personally convey his condolences to Virginia Foley.  At 1400 </p><p>local time October 29 the Embassy will hold a memorial </p><p>service for Larry Foley at which Ambassador Gnehm and USAID </p><p>Jordan Director Toni Christiansen-Wagner will speak.  All </p><p>employees and American family members have been invited to </p><p>attend. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Arrangements for Return to U.S.:  NEA A/S Burns is </p><p>scheduled to arrive in Amman the evening of October 29 from </p><p>Manama via milair.  Also arriving this evening is AID Deputy </p><p>Administrator Fred Schieck.  Separate milair is scheduled to </p><p>arrive in Amman on Wednesday morning October 30 to transport </p><p>Virginia Foley, the remains of Larry Foley, NEA A/S Burns, </p><p>USAID Deputy Administrator Schieck, and accompanying USAID </p><p>and DOS staff to Andrews AFB.  Departure from Amman is </p><p>tentatively scheduled for 1400 on October 30. </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
