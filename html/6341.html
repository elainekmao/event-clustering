<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 000496 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>USAID/W FOR AFR/WA, MICHAEL KARBELING </p><p>LAGOS FOR ADMIN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>C O R R E C T E D COPY -- THIS IS A CORRECTED VERSION OF </p><p>ABUJA 493, CORRECTING ALL TEXT.  PLEASE CANCEL ABUJA 493 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: PRESIDENTIAL BUSINESS FORUM ON HIV/AIDS </p><p> </p><p>REFS: (A) ABUJA 2651 (B) ABUJA 03297 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary:  On Saturday morning February 15, 2003, President </p><p>Olusegun Obasanjo invited approximately 50 managing directors of </p><p>Nigeria\'s most influential national and international companies </p><p>to the Presidential Villa to discuss the creation of a Nigerian </p><p>Business Coalition Against HIV/AIDS.   By the end of this meeting, </p><p>the managing directors of Chevron/ Texaco and MTN, the leading </p><p>Nigerian wireless communication company, had accepted to co-chair </p><p>the Coalition along with the President, and the business leaders </p><p>had agreed upon an organizational meeting in Lagos in March. </p><p>The President acknowledged at length the pioneering role of </p><p>Ambassador Howard F. Jeter in advancing the involvement of the </p><p>business sector through his luncheons with the U.S. business </p><p>community focused on the national HIV/AIDS effort (see above </p><p>referenced cable 03297).  The Chairman of the National Action </p><p>Committee on AIDS (NACA) also acknowledged the pivotal role of </p><p>Ambassador Jeter in this area and of USAID in its support of </p><p>NACA.  In less than 6 months, as a result of Ambassador Jeter </p><p>and USAID\'s interventions with the US business community, the </p><p>involvement of the business sector in the HIV/AIDS effort has </p><p>gone from an idiosyncratic affair to one of organized public </p><p>commitment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. Remarks by the NACA Chairman:  After words of welcome by </p><p>President Obasanjo, the Chairman of NACA, Professor Babatunde </p><p>Osotimehin, opened the Presidential Forum by reviewing the </p><p>epidemiological profile of HIV prevalence in Nigeria and the </p><p>Federal Government of Nigeria\'s response to date.   He cited </p><p>the contributions of major donors, including USAID, to the </p><p>national effort and reported that the federal government and </p><p>donors have pledged over US$400 million in HIV/AIDS funding </p><p>for the next three years.   Professor Osotimehin also stated, </p><p>however, that Nigeria would require at least US$ 500 million </p><p>annually for the next 5 years to contain the epidemic.  He </p><p>cited the following activities as the most critical ones to be </p><p>implemented: a) mass campaigns to raise public awareness and </p><p>scale up community involvement; b) voluntary counseling and </p><p>testing (VCT); c) care and support interventions, especially </p><p>treatment of opportunistic infections and the scaling up of </p><p>antiretroviral (ARV) treatment programs; d) services </p><p>targeting particularly vulnerable groups such as long distance </p><p>truck drivers, sex workers and youth both in and out of school; </p><p>and e) the continuing need for capacity building for all levels </p><p>of actors. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  Quoting Lee Smith, former President of Levi Strauss that </p><p>\'It is inevitable that a company doing business in the </p><p>developing world will pay for AIDS, it is just a question of </p><p>when and how much\', Professor Osotimehin then proceeded to </p><p>outline potential private sector contributions to the national </p><p>effort.  These included i) company HIV/AIDS policies ii) </p><p>awareness programs that include workplace discussion; iii) peer </p><p>education; iv) IEC materials; v) condom distribution; vi) </p><p>in-house counselors and VCT services; vii) post \' exposure </p><p>prophylaxis policy and procedure; viii) ARV treatment and ix) </p><p>home based care for AIDS symptomatic employees. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  Professor Osotimehin emphasized, \'The earlier the Nigerian </p><p>business community engages with the issue, the greater the </p><p>chance it has to mitigate the types of economic impacts already </p><p>seen in Southern Africa\'.    He quoted a recent study undertaken </p><p>by the Nigerian Employers Consultative Association to underscore </p><p>the critical need for greater business sector involvement. </p><p>According to this study, only 24% or slightly less than one </p><p>quarter of managers in the private sector perceive the potential </p><p>impact of HIV/AIDS on business concerns; only 32% or less than </p><p>a third of firms undertook employee HIV/AIDS activities in </p><p>fiscal 2001; and 45% or almost half of employees receive </p><p>information about HIV/AIDS only from outside their workplace. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. As an outstanding instance of business sector involvement, </p><p>Professor Osotimehin commended Coca Cola for the use of its </p><p>trucks for distribution as a major contribution to the massive </p><p>awareness campaign.  He also offered the following examples of </p><p>how other companies might contribute: i) telecommunication </p><p>companies: assistance in tele-networking, management </p><p>information systems and monitoring and evaluation; ii) oil </p><p>and related companies:  technical assistance in project </p><p>management and procurement; iii) other subsectors: </p><p>contributions of their marketing skills, use of brand to </p><p>carry messages, e.g. cell phone companies could display </p><p>short HIV messages on a regular basis, provide toll free </p><p>numbers for hotline information services; iv) hotel industry: </p><p>provision of information and commodities to guests.  He </p><p>concluded this portion of his remarks by suggesting that all </p><p>companies could espouse the \'Adopt a PLWA concept\'.  In this </p><p>way, according to Professor Osotimehin, needy people living </p><p>with AIDS (PLWA) would receive assistance and the business </p><p>sector would also help reduce stigma. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. Specifics of Business Sector Involvement:  However, </p><p>Professor Osotimehin was empathic that he was asking for more </p><p>than private sector policies and programs.   In his words, </p><p>\'involvement of the private sector should go beyond the </p><p>workplace\' we are also asking the private sector to add its </p><p>core competencies to the overall response.   The NACA </p><p>Chairman then summarized his request for private sector </p><p>involvement as i) the establishment of work place initiatives; </p><p>ii) the extension of these initiatives to the immediate </p><p>communities where the companies work; and iii) active </p><p>participation in the national response, e.g. private sector </p><p>participation on the NACA board and, especially, in the </p><p>establishment of the Nigerian Business Coalition Against </p><p>HIV/AIDS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. President Obasanjo\'s Remarks:  Both in his impromptu and </p><p>prepared remarks, President Obasanjo echoed the theme of </p><p>Ambassador Jeter during his organizational luncheons with the </p><p>U.S. business community and by the NACA chairman in his </p><p>presentation to the Forum.   That is, even more than its </p><p>financial resources, the business sector involvement in </p><p>the national effort must include the contribution of its core </p><p>competencies.    In his opening remarks, the President </p><p>specified that it was not the financial resources of the </p><p>business sector that he wanted but rather their involvement </p><p>in the national HIV/AIDS effort: \'Don?t give me money, just </p><p>help me put an end to HIV\'.   In his prepared remarks, the </p><p>President reiterated this sentiment, \'Ladies and </p><p>Gentlemen for the avoidance of doubt let me state quite clearly </p><p>that this event is not meant to be seen as a fund raising </p><p>exercise but one that seeks to raise the consciousness of </p><p>corporate Nigeria to the facts about the epidemic and seek </p><p>to recruit this important sector to join us in the fight. </p><p>We expect that \'the private sector will allow us to utilize </p><p>their core competencies in the fight and also let us share part </p><p>of their sunk costs to leverage the fight.\'. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. Epidemic Impact on Nigeria: President Obasanjo began his </p><p>prepared statement by discussing the economic threat of HIV/AIDS </p><p>to the economy of Nigeria.  He said that the pandemic is </p><p>threatening \'the fabric of our economy\' and that \'Nigerians </p><p>cannot afford to wait any longer to redeem themselves from this </p><p>dreadful infection\'That is why I have called you together?. </p><p>President Obasanjo also stressed that the burden of the epidemic </p><p>is greatest in Africa.   He quoted UNAIDS statistics that of the </p><p>40 million people infected with HIV, 28 million of these are in </p><p>sub-Saharan Africa and that of the 14 million children </p><p>orphaned by AIDS, 11 million of them are in the region.  The </p><p>President also estimated that the number of Nigerians infected </p><p>with HIV is between 3.4 million and 4.5 million.    This latter </p><p>figure represents the highest estimate of the number of HIV </p><p>positive persons in Nigeria ever given publicly by a top Nigerian </p><p>official. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. National Intelligence Council Report Quoted:  The President </p><p>also quoted at length the recent National Intelligence Council </p><p>report on the five \'next wave\' countries that will double or </p><p>triple the number of global HIV/AIDS cases by 2010.  Reiterating </p><p>his previous theme, the President stressed that of these five </p><p>countries--- Nigeria, China, India, Russia and Ethiopia---two </p><p>are in sub-Saharan Africa.  According to President Obasanjo the </p><p>consequences of this report on Nigerian international </p><p>relationships is immense.  To quote the President, \'The </p><p>implication of this report is that all nations of the world </p><p>will be focusing on Nigeria and its reaction or response to the </p><p>epidemic.  If nothing is done quickly, this will affect our </p><p>bilateral, economic and political relations with other </p><p>countries\'. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. Marching Orders to the Business Sector: President Obasanjo </p><p>ended his address by specifying his requests to the business </p><p>sector:  \'We are looking forward to your organizations setting </p><p>up workplace initiatives and within the larger context of </p><p>communities in which you work you will contribute to the national </p><p>response\'.Furthermore we also see today\'s forum as the beginning </p><p>\'of constructive engagement\' we propose to launch the Nigerian </p><p>Business Council (sic) on HIV/AIDS which I will co-chair </p><p>with two other distinguished leaders from the private sector\'The </p><p>Council will be expected to provide the platform for subsequent </p><p>discussions and decisions for the private sector in their effort </p><p>to stem this epidemic\'. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. Appreciation of Ambassador Jeter:  Before concluding his </p><p>address, President Obasanjo cited the contribution of Ambassador </p><p>Jeter:  \'I particularly will like to extend the gratitude of our </p><p>government to the American Ambassador Howard Jeter who </p><p>independent of our thinking has institutionalized a </p><p>consultative process with the American community in </p><p>Nigeria sanitizing (sic) them to the HIV/AIDS situation in Nigeria. </p><p>We believe a good number of them are here today because of this </p><p>interaction\'.   Professor Osotimehin who credited the Ambassador </p><p>for initiating efforts with the business community on behalf of </p><p>the national HIV/AIDS effort echoed this appreciation.   He also </p><p>singularly expressed appreciation of USAID for its support of this </p><p>effort and for its support of NACA. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. Appointment of Two Business Sector Co-Chairs:  Before he left </p><p>the Forum to begin campaigning in the Delta, President Obasanjo </p><p>invited Jay Parson, the Managing Director for Chevron/Texaco, </p><p>and Adrian Wood, the Managing Director of MTN, the leading </p><p>wireless communication company in the country, to co-chair with </p><p>him the Nigerian Business Council on HIV/AIDS.   In his words, </p><p>\'I will not chair but will co-chair\' we will be in the driver\'s </p><p>seat together\' and to emphasize this point he called the two </p><p>co-chairs to sit with him at the Presidential Podium for the </p><p>media to record this event.   Parson immediately assumed the </p><p>mantel of responsibility and promised to convene a meeting of the </p><p>business sector in March.   In his words, \'We will combine </p><p>collective talents and skills and we will come back with </p><p>decisions and strategies for the way forward\'. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. Summary:  The success of this Forum must and will be </p><p>judged by the future actions initiated by the Nigerian Business </p><p>Coalition on HIV/AIDS.  However it was a remarkable event and </p><p>one that six months ago would have hardly been imaginable. </p><p>The dynamic leadership of the new NACA Chairman who appears to </p><p>have the confidence of the President has created a milieu for the </p><p>national HIV and AIDS effort in which such innovation and </p><p>concerted effort can occur(see above referenced cable 2651). </p><p>Professor Osotimehin immediately took advantage of the </p><p>opportunities resulting from Ambassador Jeter\'s initiative with </p><p>the U.S. business community and the technical assistance and </p><p>knowledge of the business world offered by the USAID consultant, </p><p>Mr. Percy Wilson.  The results of the luncheons proved that many </p><p>businesses in Nigeria either were already involved in some more </p><p>or less idiosyncratic fashion or that they were ready to become </p><p>involved.  These luncheons obviously were the stimulus behind </p><p>and inspiration for this groundbreaking Forum. Mr. Wilson has </p><p>become a confident of the NACA Chairman and mentors his </p><p>dealings with the business community.    In conclusion, the </p><p>Mission would like to express its appreciation of AFR/SD for </p><p>their role in the initiation of this activity with the offer </p><p>of a consultant, Mr. Wilson, to develop a pilot business related </p><p>activity in Nigeria. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
