SUMMARY. THE UN FOOD AND AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATION </p><p>(FAO) COMMITTEE ON WORLD FOOD SECURITY (CFS) WILL MEET </p><p>MAY 12-16 IN ITS FIRST SESSION AFTER THE "WORLD FOOD </p><p>SUMMIT:FIVE YEARS LATER" RECONFIRMED ITS MANDATE TO </p><p>MONITOR PROGRESS TOWARDS REACHING THE GOAL OF HALVING </p><p>WORLD HUNGER BY 2015.  THE CFS WILL CONSIDER FAO\'S "ANTI- </p><p>HUNGER PROGRAM" -- A USD 24 BILLION/YEAR PROPOSAL TO "GET </p><p>COUNTRIES ON TRACK TOWARDS MEETING WORLD FOOD SUMMIT </p><p>GOALS"-- AND FAO\'S PROPOSAL TO INSTITUTIONALIZE THE </p><p>"INTERNATIONAL ALLIANCE AGAINST HUNGER."  THE CFS MEETING </p><p>PRESENTS OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE UNITED STATES TO WORK WITH </p><p>OTHER COUNTRIES TO IMPROVE CFS MONITORING AND TO </p><p>HIGHLIGHT THE U.S.\'S OWN "ANTI-HUNGER" INITIATIVES.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>OPENING OF THE SESSION, BUREAU </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  THE 29TH SESSION OF THE CFS WILL MEET MAY 12-16, 2003 </p><p>IN ITS FIRST SESSION AFTER THE 2002 WORLD FOOD </p><p>SUMMIT:FIVE YEARS LATER MEETING (WFS5YL) RECONFIRMED ITS </p><p>MANDATE TO MONITOR PROGRESS TOWARDS REACHING THE GOAL OF </p><p>HALVING WORLD HUNGER BY 2015. THE CFS BUREAU SERVES FOR </p><p>TWO SESSIONS.  THE CHAIR (THAILAND) AND VICE-CHAIRS </p><p>(FRANCE, REPUBLIC OF KOREA, EGYPT AND SOUTH AFRICA) WILL </p><p>SERVE THROUGH THIS YEAR\'S SESSION.  THE PRESIDENT OF THE </p><p>DOMINICAN REPUBLIC WILL OPEN THE SESSION.  FAO DIRECTOR </p><p>GENERAL JACQUES DIOUF WILL ATTEND THE FIRST DAY.  THE </p><p>U.S. WILL REPRESENT NORTH AMERICA ON THE DRAFTING </p><p>COMMITTEE. </p><p> </p><p>ITEM II.  FAO DISTINGUISHED LECTURE ON FOOD SECURITY </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p>3. FORMER IMF DIRECTOR MICHEL CAMDESSUS WILL PRESENT THE </p><p>LECTURE. </p><p> </p><p>ITEM III. ASSESSMENT OF THE WORLD FOOD SECURITY SITUATION </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>4.  THE FAO ASSESSMENT PRESENTS A BRIEF ANALYSIS OF THE </p><p>CURRENT WORLD FOOD SECURITY SITUATION. </p><p> </p><p>5. CURRENT SITUATION: THE DOCUMENT STATES THAT THE NUMBER </p><p>OF UNDERNOURISHED IS NOW ESTIMATED AT 840 MILLION, A </p><p>DECREASE OF BARELY 2.5 MILLION OVER THE LAST 7 YEARS, AND </p><p>FAR BELOW THE 22 MILLION A YEAR REQUIRED TO ACHIEVE THE </p><p>WORLD FOOD SUMMIT (WFS) GOAL OF HALVING THE NUMBER OF </p><p>HUNGRY BY 2015. OUT OF A TOTAL OF 96 DEVELOPING COUNTRIES </p><p>FOR WHICH COMPARABLE DATA EXISTS, THE FAO CONSIDERS THAT </p><p>24 COUNTRIES ARE "ON TRACK" TO ACHIEVING THE WFS TARGET, </p><p>6 ARE "LAGGING BEHIND" AND 44 COUNTRIES ARE "OFF TRACK." </p><p>OUTSIDE OF ASIA AND EASTERN EUROPE, GROWTH RATES IN MOST </p><p>DEVELOPING COUNTRIES ARE "TOO LOW TO GENERATE A MARKED </p><p>EFFECT ON POVERTY REDUCTION." </p><p> </p><p>6.  HUNGER HOT SPOTS: 38 COUNTRIES, MOST OF THEM (25) IN </p><p>AFRICA, ARE EXPERIENCING SERIOUS FOOD SHORTAGES. </p><p> </p><p>7.  FOOD AID REQUIREMENTS: THE WFP FIGURE OF USD 3 </p><p>BILLION FOR 2003 IS CITED. </p><p> </p><p>8.  AVAILABILITY AND STABILITY OF SUPPLY:  THE REPORT </p><p>NOTES LAST YEAR\'S DECLINE IN CEREAL PRODUCTION, WITH </p><p>PRODUCTION OF OTHER BASIC FOODS UNCHANGED OR SHOWING </p><p>MODEST INCREASES. </p><p> </p><p>9.  FOOD IMPORT BILLS FOR DEVELOPING COUNTRIES TRENDED </p><p>DOWN DUE TO FALLING INTERNATIONAL PRICES FROM MID-90\'S TO </p><p>2001.  THE VOLUME OF FOOD IMPORTS BY DEVELOPING COUNTRIES </p><p>ROSE SUBSTANTIALLY DURING THE SAME PERIOD.  STARTING IN </p><p>2002, THE IMPORT BILL INCREASED BY OVER 6 PERCENT (IN </p><p>NOMINAL TERMS), MOSTLY DUE TO RISING INTERNATIONAL PRICES </p><p>FOR WHEAT, COARSE GRAINS, OILS, FATS AND OILSEEDS.  THE </p><p>REPORT CONCLUDES THAT "IF RECENT INTERNATIONAL COMMODITY </p><p>PRICES INCREASES ARE SUSTAINED IN 2003, AND TRANSMITTED </p><p>TO INTERNAL MARKET PRICES IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, THE </p><p>DEMAND FOR FOOD IMPORTS IN THOSE COUNTRIES WILL BE </p><p>AFFECTED NEGATIVELY." </p><p> </p><p>10.

IT NOTES THAT THE BENEFITS </p><p>FROM FREER TRADE DO NOT COME AUTOMATICALLY, AND </p><p>HIGHLIGHTS THE IMPORTANCE OF ASSISTING DEVELOPING </p><p>COUNTRIES TO IMPROVE THEIR CAPACITY TO COMPLY WITH </p><p>INTERNATIONAL FOOD SAFETY STANDARDS AS WELL AS TO </p><p>PARTICIPATE IN AGRICULTURAL TRADE NEGOTIATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>11.  IN THE CONTEXT OF FOOD SAFETY, THE DOCUMENT NOTES </p><p>THREE INITIATIVES:  FAO\'S "STRATEGY TOWARDS A FOOD CHAIN </p><p>APPROACH TO FOOD SAFETY AND QUALITY "; THE NEWLY </p><p>ESTABLISHED WHO/FAO CODEX ALIMENTARIUS TRUST FUND AND THE </p><p>INTEREST IN HOLDING A SECOND GLOBAL FORUM OF FOOD SAFETY </p><p>REGULATORS.  THE DOCUMENT NOTES THAT A PREPARATORY </p><p>MEETING ON THE SECOND GLOBAL FORUM WILL BE HELD IN JULY </p><p>2003 TO FINALIZE THE ARRANGEMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>12.  COMMENT: THE LAST CFS SESSION REQUESTED THAT THE FAO </p><p>PROVIDE A "DRAFT FRAMEWORK DOCUMENT OUTLINING FAO\'S </p><p>STRATEGIES TO ADDRESS KEY ELEMENTS OF POLICY ADVICE, </p><p>CAPACITY BUILDING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE, AND ACTIONS </p><p>THAT NEED TO BE TAKEN AT NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL </p><p>LEVELS TO ENSURE ACCESS TO SAFE AND NUTRITIOUS FOOD." THE </p><p>RESULTING DOCUMENT, FAO\'S "STRATEGY ON A FOOD CHAIN </p><p>APPROACH TO FOOD SAFETY AND QUALITY" AROUSED STRONG </p><p>OBJECTIONS FROM CAIRNS GROUP COUNTRIES (AND THE U.S.) AT </p><p>THE RECENTLY CONCLUDED COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE (REFTEL </p><p>B), NOT LEAST BECAUSE THE FAO HAD ADDED "QUALITY" TO THE </p><p>FRAMEWORK.  WE EXPECT CAIRNS GROUP COUNTRIES TO RAISE </p><p>THOSE CONCERNS AGAIN (AS SHOULD THE U.S.). USDEL SHOULD </p><p>ALSO COMMENT ON THE PROPOSED SECOND GLOBAL FORUM OF FOOD </p><p>SAFETY REGULATORS. END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>ITEM IV. REPORT ON THE FIRST INTERGOVERNMENTAL WORKING </p><p>GROUP (IGWG): VOLUNTARY GUIDELINES ON THE RIGHT TO FOOD </p><p>IN THE CONTEXT OF NATIONAL FOOD SECURITY </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>13.  THE CFS WILL HEAR A REPORT OF THE IGWG\'S FIRST </p><p>MEETING IN MARCH 2003.  WE DO NOT EXPECT SUBSTANTIVE </p><p>DISCUSSION. (SEE REFTEL A REPORTING CABLE ON THE IGWG). </p><p>ITEM V.  RECENT FAO INITIATIVES IN THE FIGHT AGAINST </p><p>HUNGER: ANTI-HUNGER PROGRAM; INTERNATIONAL ALLIANCE </p><p>AGAINST HUNGER </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  THE CFS WILL BE ASKED TO "ENDORSE" THE FAO\'S "ANTI- </p><p>HUNGER PROGRAM," FIRST UNVEILED AT THE WORLD FOOD SUMMIT </p><p>FIVE YEARS LATER (WFS5YL) AND REVISED FOR THE WORLD </p><p>SUMMIT ON SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT (WSSD).  THE FAO "ANTI- </p><p>HUNGER PROGRAM" ESTIMATES AN ANNUAL NEED FOR PUBLIC </p><p>INVESTMENT ON THE ORDER OF USD 24 BILLION (EVENLY </p><p>FINANCED BETWEEN DONORS AND RECIPIENTS, ACCORDING TO THE </p><p>FAO) TO "BRING HUNGER REDUCTION BACK ON TRACK."  THE </p><p>PUBLIC INVESTMENT "PACKAGE" POSITS THE NEED FOR USD 5 </p><p>BILLION FOR DIRECT TRANSFERS TO THE UNDERNOURISHED AND </p><p>USD 19 BILLION FOR ADDRESSING THE PROBLEM OF </p><p>UNDERNOURISHMENT AND RURAL POVERTY THROUGH AGRICULTURAL </p><p>GROWTH AND PRODUCTIVITY ENHANCEMENT IN RURAL AREAS.  FAO </p><p>ALSO INTENDS TO RE-NAME THE PROGRAM "THE ANTI-HUNGER </p><p>PROGRAM IN SUPPORT OF THE UN MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT </p><p>GOALS."  FAO REITERATED THAT THE PROGRAM IS A </p><p>"PROGRAMMATIC CALL TO ACTION BY ALL STAKEHOLDERS" AND </p><p>THAT THE FAO DOES NOT SEEK A NEW ROLE OR NEW RESOURCES. </p><p> </p><p>15.  COMMENT:  CONVERSATIONS WITH OTHER OECD MEMBERS ON </p><p>THE "ANTI-HUNGER PROGRAM" HAVE SHOWN THAT MEMBERS ARE </p><p>CONCERNED THAT ENDORSEMENT OF THE PROGRAM MAY IMPLY </p><p>CONSENT EITHER TO THE USD 24 BILLION "PRICE TAG" OR TO A </p><p>COMMITMENT TO FUND PART OF THE ANTI-HUNGER PROGRAM. END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>16. UNDER "FAO INITIATIVES," THE CFS WILL ALSO BE ASKED </p><p>TO ENDORSE THE "AIMS, GUIDING PRINCIPLES AND ACTIVITIES" </p><p>OF THE INTERNATIONAL ALLIANCE AGAINST HUNGER (IAAH).  THE </p><p>CFS SHOULD ADVISE ON FREQUENCY OF MEETINGS, AND INDICATE </p><p>FUNDING OPTIONS (THE DOCUMENT INDICATE THAT THERE IS A </p><p>NEED FOR RESOURCES TO ESTABLISH AND OPERATE THE IAAH). </p><p>THE IAAH, FIRST DISCUSSED AT THE WFS5YL, WOULD BUILD UPON </p><p>EXISTING INITIATIVES AT NATIONAL, REGIONAL AND </p><p></p><p>ACTION IO-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   AMAD-00  CIAE-00  COME-00  CTME-00  INL-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  ITCE-00  WHA-00   SRPP-00  EB-00    EXME-00  EUR-00 </p><p>      UTED-00  TEDE-00  INR-00   ITC-01   NSAE-00  OES-00   OIC-02 </p><p>      OMB-01   OPIC-01  SS-00    STR-00   TEST-00  TRSE-00  SAS-00 </p><p></p><p>R 230813Z APR 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 9358 </p><p>INFO USDA WASHDC </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p>AMEMBASSY MEXICO </p><p>AMEMBASSY MOSCOW </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 03 OF 04 ROME 001706 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR IO/EDA WINNICK AND KOTOK </p><p>USDA/FAS FOR REICH AND HUGHES </p><p>USAID FOR CUMMINGS </p><p>MEXICO CITY FOR BRAKEL </p><p>MOSCOW FOR WIGGIN </p><p> </p><p>FROM FODAG </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS:  AORC, EAID, EAGR, FAO </p><p></p><p>SUBJECT:  PREVIEW OF FAO COMMITTEE ON WORLD FOOD SECURITY </p><p>29TH SESSION </p><p> </p><p>INTERNATIONAL LEVELS.  THE EXISTENCE OF THE IAAH WOULD </p><p>"PROVIDE INTERNATIONAL RECOGNITION FOR NATIONAL </p><p>INITIATIVES AS PART OF AN INTERNATIONAL PROCESS OF </p><p>WORKING TOWARD THE WFS GOAL." THE IAAH WOULD LINK </p><p>TOGETHER STATE AND NON-STATE ACTORS (INCLUDING NGO\'S AND </p><p>THE PRIVATE SECTOR) IN EFFORTS TO MEET THE WFS GOALS. </p><p> </p><p>VI. STANDING ITEM ON NUTRITION: THE ROLE OF AQUACULTURE </p><p>IN IMPROVING FOOD SECURITY AND </p><p> </p><p>VII.  THEMATIC ISSUE:  THE IMPACT OF DISASTERS ON LONG- </p><p>TERM FOOD SECURITY AND POVERTY ALLEVIATION - POLICY </p><p>IMPLICATIONS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p>17.  THE DOCUMENTS PROVIDE PRACTICAL SUGGESTIONS FOR </p><p>MITIGATING THE IMPACT OF DISASTERS AND DISCUSSES THE </p><p>POTENTIAL OF AQUACULTURE FOR IMPROVING FOOD SECURITY. </p><p> </p><p>VIII.  OTHER MATTERS -- THEMES FOR NEXT SESSION </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>18.  UNDER "OTHER MATTERS" MEMBERS WILL BE ASKED TO </p><p>COMMENT ON THE PROPOSED THEMES FOR THE NEXT SESSION AND </p><p>IDENTIFY ONE FOR THE NEXT SESSION.  THE PROPOSED THEMES </p><p>ARE: </p><p> </p><p>A. AN ASSESSMENT OF THE COSTS OF HUNGER; </p><p>B. CROP AND INCOME DIVERSIFICATION - IMPLICATIONS FOR </p><p>SMALLHOLDER PRODUCTION SYSTEMS AND FOOD SECURITY; </p><p>C. BEST PRACTICES IN REDUCING RURAL POVERTY AND FOOD </p><p>INSECURITY IN MARGINAL LANDS - LESSONS FROM SUCCESSFUL </p><p>EXPERIENCES IN SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES AND </p><p>ECONOMIC POLICIES IN SELECTED COUNTRIES; </p><p>D. AGRICULTURAL BIODIVERSITY: THE IMPORTANCE SMALL FARMER </p><p>IN-SITU CONSERVATION OF PLANT GENETIC RESOURCES; </p><p>E. IMPLICATIONS OF GMO\'S FOR FOOD SECURITY AND FOOD </p><p>SAFETY. </p><p> </p><p>19. COMMENT:  MISSION RECOMMENDS C AS THE BEST THEME, </p><p>WITH B AND D ACCEPTABLE.  WE WOULD NOT SUPPORT A OR E. </p><p>MISSION ALSO RECOMMENDS THAT AMONG THE THEMES FOR NEXT </p><p>YEAR\'S SELECTION BE ONE ON HIV/AIDS AND ITS IMPACT ON </p><p>FOOD SECURITY. </p><p> </p><p>INFORMATION DOCUMENTS -- COST OF WFS5YL </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p>20.  A DOCUMENT ON THE COST OF THE WFS5YL IS INCLUDED IN </p><p>THE INFORMATION DOCUMENTS.  ACCORDING TO THE FAO </p><p>CALCULATIONS, THE WFS5YL CONSUMED SOME USD 2 MILLION IN </p><p>REGULAR BUDGET RESOURCES OF WHICH USD 463,000 WERE </p><p>"DIRECT INCREMENTAL COSTS" AND USD 1,46 MILLION WERE </p><p>"REDIRECTED" FROM DIVISIONS FROM WITHIN EXISTING </p><p>ALLOTMENTS.  ANOTHER USD 2 MILLION WAS PROVIDED BY </p><p>VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTIONS FROM GOVERNMENTS AND THE PRIVATE </p><p>SECTOR. </p><p> </p><p>INFORMAL PANEL DISCUSSION ON THE IMPACT OF ACCESS TO LAND </p><p>ON IMPROVING FOOD SECURITY AND ALLEVIATING RURAL POVERTY </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p> </p><p>21.  THE PANEL IS CONSIDERED "OFF THE RECORD" AND WILL BE </p><p>HELD ON FRIDAY MORNING (5/16) BEFORE ADOPTION OF THE </p><p>FINAL REPORT.  THE PANEL WILL LOOK AT SUCCESSFUL CASES OF </p><p>LAND REFORM IN SELECTED COUNTRIES.  PANEL SPEAKERS ARE </p><p>EXPECTED FROM BRAZIL, THE PHILIPPINES, A U.S. SPEAKER </p><p>FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN LAND TENURE CENTER AND </p><p>POSSIBLY A REPRESENTATIVE FROM SOUTH AFRICA. </p><p> </p><p>HIV/AIDS PRESENTATION </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>22.  THE SECRETARIAT WILL HAVE MULTIPLE SCREENINGS OF A </p><p>SHORT FILM "SOWING THE SEEDS OF HUNGER" ADDRESSING THE </p><p>IMPACT OF HIV/AIDS ON AGRICULTURE. </p><p> </p><p>WFS REPORTING </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>23. MISOFFS DISCUSSED THE DIFFICULTIES THAT COUNTRIES </p><p>HAVE WITH THE CURRENT SYSTEM OF CFS REPORTING WITH NEW </p><p>CFS SECRETARY MARGARITA FLORES (MEXICO) AND STAFF MEMBER </p><p>DORJEE KINLAY.

IT WAS AGREED THAT THEY </p><p>WOULD DISCUSS WITH THE BUREAU THE POSSIBILITY OF HOLDING </p><p>AN INFORMAL WORKING GROUP DURING THE WEEK TO DISCUSS WAYS </p><p>TO IMPROVE REPORTING ON THE WFS TARGETS.  FLORES ALSO </p><p>WELCOMED NEWS THAT THE U.S. WAS CONSIDERING HOLDING A </p><p>"SIDE-EVENT." (FLORES EXPLAINED THAT INTERPRETATION COSTS </p><p>WOULD HAVE TO BE BORNE BY THE U.S.)  FLORES NOTED THAT </p><p>THE SECRETARIAT HAS SOUGHT TO VARY THE CFS FORMAT WITH </p><p>GUEST SPEAKERS AND SIDE EVENTS. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>-------- </p><p>24.  THE GOALS OF THE WORLD FOOD SUMMIT ARE TO BE </p><p>ACCOMPLISHED BY COUNTRIES, NOT BY INTERNATIONAL </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS; THE FAO PLAYS A SUPPORTING ROLE, BUT </p><p>COUNTRIES MUST FEEL MORE RESPONSIBILITY FOR REPORTING ON </p><p>PROGRESS ACHIEVED.  THERE IS GENERAL AGREEMENT THAT THE </p><p>CFS HAS BEEN PUTTING IN A LACKLUSTER PERFORMANCE OVER THE </p><p>LAST FEW YEARS, AND ONE INCOMMENSURATE WITH THE </p><p>IMPORTANCE OF ITS MANDATE.  RECOGNIZING THAT THE CURRENT </p><p>REPORTING FORMAT IS BURDENSOME, AND LEADS TO A HIGH RATE </p><p>OF NON-REPORTING, IMPROVING THE COUNTRY REPORTING SYSTEM </p><p>SHOULD BE ONE OF THE CFS\'S HIGHEST PRIORITIES.
