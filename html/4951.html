<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 RANGOON 000016 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p>USCINCPAC FOR FPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/05/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, BM, NLD </p><p>SUBJECT: BURMA\'S INDEPENDENCE DAY; THE NLD CALLS FOR </p><p>DIALOGUE; THE GOB FOR DISCIPLINE </p><p> </p><p>REF: 02 RANGOON 1663 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: COM Carmen M. Martinez. Reason: 1.5 (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: Burma\'s January 4 Independence Day </p><p>celebrations produced no new gestures of reconciliation and </p><p>perhaps a slight hardening of positions on both sides.  The </p><p>National League for Democracy called for an end to political </p><p>oppression, the release of all political prisoners, and the </p><p>initiation of a "real" political dialogue on constitutional </p><p>issues.  It also indicated that there was no room for any </p><p>reciprocal, confidence-building gestures from the NLD until a </p><p>real political dialogue was started.  The government rejected </p><p>international criticism of the harassment to which Aung San </p><p>Suu Kyi had been subjected in Rakhine State and called on all </p><p>parties to "play by the prevailing rules and regulations." </p><p>It also focused its Independence Day speeches almost </p><p>exclusively on history and the economy, saying nothing at all </p><p>about political transition.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>NLD Celebration </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) The NLD celebration took place as usual before a crowd </p><p>of about 500, including ethnic representatives (mostly </p><p>members of the Committee to Represent the People\'s </p><p>Parliament), diplomats from most Western embassies and Japan, </p><p>and representatives of the UN agencies.  The highlight was </p><p>the presentation of a new party resolution which reaffirmed </p><p>the party\'s willingness to work cooperatively with the </p><p>military on political transition, but which also condemned </p><p>the continuing political oppression in Burma and called for </p><p>the start of a "real dialogue" on constitutional issues. </p><p>Until that dialogue started, the resolution said, the party </p><p>would stand by its current positions.  It would demand that </p><p>the results of the 1990 election be implemented and would </p><p>refuse to attend the National Convention convened by the SPDC </p><p>to draft a new constitution.  It would also continue to hold </p><p>to its current position on aid: aid should be granted to </p><p>Burma only for humanitarian purposes and then only under </p><p>conditions that would ensure that it was "transparent, </p><p>accountable, and independently monitored."  In her oral </p><p>remarks, ASSK added a call for selfless dedication to the </p><p>party.  If the party was rent by the pursuit of individual </p><p>ambition, it would inevitably dissolve. </p><p> </p><p>The GOB Celebrations </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) The GOB itself had nothing to say about democracy or </p><p>political transition in any of its official Independence Day </p><p>messages.  Delivered before the usual crowds of thousands, </p><p>those speeches focused almost exclusively on history and the </p><p>economy, and the current need for austerity.  There was not a </p><p>word about democracy or political transition.  Moreover, in a </p><p>statement released that same day, the GOB rejected </p><p>international criticism of the harassment the NLD encountered </p><p>in Rakhine State (reftel) and called on all political parties </p><p>"to play by the rules and regulations of the political game." </p><p> The local authorities in Rakhine State, the GOB said, were </p><p>only applying the law and, in particular, the current ban on </p><p>all outdoor political rallies. </p><p> </p><p>Other Groups </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Two other groups also chimed in with political </p><p>statements.  U Tha Gyaw, the Chairman of the National Unity </p><p>Party, which is basically the reincarnation of Ne Win\'s old </p><p>Burma Socialist Program Party, called for a multiparty </p><p>democracy.  Similarly, at an event attended by ASSK and other </p><p>NLD leaders, the Veteran Politicians Group (basically General </p><p>Aung San and Ne Win\'s contemporaries) called for the SPDC and </p><p>the NLD to start "a meaningful political dialogue at the </p><p>earliest possible moment." </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Independence Day may not have produced any progress on </p><p>political transition, but it at least produced some clarity </p><p>regarding both sides\' positions.  ASSK has been saying for </p><p>some time that the period of confidence-building is over. </p><p>From the party\'s Independence Day resolution, it is now clear </p><p>what she means by that: until a "real dialogue" has begun, </p><p>there is no room for reciprocal gestures by the NLD (e.g. </p><p>calling for additional aid or any easing of sanctions). </p><p>Evidently, the NLD has come to the decision that it has few </p><p>cards to play and cannot play any of those cards prematurely. </p><p> Once there is a real prospect for change; i.e., some real </p><p>dialogue with the government, then the NLD can call for some </p><p>relaxation of the current pressure.  Until that point is </p><p>reached, however, the party (or at least ASSK) now apparently </p><p>believes that the best counsel is simply to hold firm. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) The GOB meanwhile has laid down some markers of its </p><p>own, cautioning the NLD not to abuse the political freedoms </p><p>it\'s been given.  The "evolving political transition in </p><p>Myanmar will continue unabated, provided that political </p><p>parties also play by the prevailing rules and regulations of </p><p>the political game."  The hint is that the government will </p><p>react firmly to any efforts to provoke unrest or </p><p>confrontation. </p><p>7. (C) Finally, the positions of the NUP and the veteran </p><p>politicians are both interesting.  The NUP has always been </p><p>one of the props of the regime.  That it is now choosing to </p><p>come down publicly in favor of multiparty democracy is a </p><p>strong indication of the direction in which it sees the </p><p>political winds blowing.  Similarly, the Veteran Politicians </p><p>Group has long called for dialogue.  This is the first time, </p><p>however, that it has issued that call in company with the NLD </p><p>and Aung San Suu Kyi.  End Comment. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
