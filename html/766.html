SENATORS WARNER AND KERREY WERE BRIEFED IN KNIN IN </p><p>THE UN COMPOUND BY LOCAL UNCRO MILITARY OFFICERS AND </p><p>OBSERVERS, REPRESENTATIVES OF THE UN HUMAN RIGHTS CENTER, </p><p>THE EC MONITORING MISSION AND UNHCR.  THE UN AND ECMM </p><p>ASSESSMENTS OF THE ATTACK AND AFTERMATH OF THE HV\'S </p><p>"OPERATION STORM" WERE BLUNT AND FEATURED DISTURBING </p><p>ALLEGATIONS OF SIGNIFICANT HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS, </p><p>INCLUDING LARGE-SCALE BURNING OF SERB HOMES AND VILLAGES, </p><p>SOME APPARENT MURDERS OF CIVILIANS AND PROBLEMS WITH </p><p>DISPLACED PERSONS.

END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>MILITARY ASPECTS OF "STORM" </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  THE OPENING MILITARY ASSESSMENT BY LOCAL UNCRO </p><p>COMMANDER FOURAND AND HIS BRIEFER, COLONEL BALFOUR (BOTH </p><p>CANADIAN OFFICERS), POSITED THAT CROATIAN FORCES (HV) </p><p>WERE SUCCESSFUL NOT BECAUSE OF MILITARY PROWESS (BALFOUR </p><p>CHARACTERIZED SOME HV TROOPS IN KNIN AS "A MOTLEY </p><p>COLLECTION OF THUGS") BUT BECAUSE OF THE "RSK" </p><p>LEADERSHIP\'S EARLY DECISION TO ORDER EVACUATION RATHER </p><p>THAN MOUNT A SUSTAINED DEFENSIVE CAMPAIGN.  FOURAND AND </p><p>BALFOUR NOTED THAT THE TERRAIN OF FORMER UN SECTOR SOUTH </p><p>IS "A DEFENDER\'S DREAM" AND THAT EVEN MARGINALLY </p><p>EFFECTIVE "RSK" COMMAND AND TACTICS COULD HAVE BOGGED HV </p><p>ATTACKERS DOWN IN A PROLONGED, DEBILITATING FIGHT. </p><p> </p><p>3.  SENATOR KERREY CHALLENGED THE VIEW THAT THE HV\'S </p><p>OPERATION WAS A SUCCESS ONLY BY DEFAULT, NOTING THE </p><p>EXTREMELY RAPID AND COMPREHENSIVE NATURE OF THE SERB </p><p>DEFEAT.  BALFOUR REPEATED THAT THE "RSK" DECISION TO </p><p>EVACUATE REMAINED THE KEY REASON FOR THE CROATIAN </p><p>VICTORY, AND FURTHER NOTED THE HV OPERATION IN SECTOR </p><p>SOUTH INVOLVED LITTLE INGENUITY AND MIRRORED EARLIER </p><p>"RSK" AND BSA TACTICS:  I.E., STAND OFF AND HAMMER THE </p><p>ENEMY\'S MILITARY AND CIVILIAN CENTERS WITH ARTILLERY -- </p><p>THE UN CLAIMED OVER 2,000 IMPACTS IN KNIN CITY -- THEN </p><p>MOVE IN TO TAKE CONTROL OF SURRENDERED OR DESERTED AREAS. </p><p>                   LIMITED OFFICIAL USE </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       LIMITED OFFICIAL USE </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  03309  01 OF 03  301520Z </p><p>(COMMENT: THE CENTER OF KNIN SHOWED LITTLE DAMAGE, BUT </p><p>THE UN CLAIMS THE HV UNDERTOOK A CLEAN-UP OF THE AREA </p><p>DURING THE PERIOD OF AUGUST 5-8, WHILE THE UN WAS STILL </p><p>CONFINED TO ITS COMPOUND.  THE CITY HAD ALSO BEEN SPRUCED </p><p>UP AUGUST 26 FOR PRESIDENT TUDJMAN\'S REOPENING OF THE </p><p>ZAGREB-KNIN-SPLIT RAILROAD.  END COMMENT.)

BURNINGS:  THE ECMM MONITOR, SOREN LIBORIUS, </p><p>ESTIMATED THAT AT LEAST 60 PERCENT OF FORMERLY SERB </p><p>DWELLINGS HAD BEEN BURNED FROM AUGUST 7 THROUGH AUGUST </p><p>24, AND SUPPLIED A WRITTEN REPORT DOCUMENTING DOZENS OF </p><p>SPECIFIC INCIDENTS.  IN SOME INSTANCES, ECMM MONITORS </p><p>OBSERVED HOUSES BEING BURNT BY UNIFORMED HV SOLDIERS </p><p>SUPPLIED BY FUEL TRUCKS IN AREAS UNDER HV OR POLICE </p><p>CONTROL.  IN OTHER INSTANCES, MIXED GROUPS OF CIVILIANS </p><p>AND MILITARY PERSONNEL WERE SEEN BURNING HOUSES.  WHILE </p><p>ECMM AND THE UN HUMAN RIGHTS REPS ATTRIBUTED SOME </p><p>BURNINGS TO INCIDENTS OF INDIVIDUAL RETRIBUTION OR </p><p>THUGGERY, THEY BELIEVED THERE MAY EXIST AN ORGANIZED </p><p>                   LIMITED OFFICIAL USE </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       LIMITED OFFICIAL USE </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  03309  02 OF 03  301521Z </p><p>CROATIAN EFFORT TO DEPRIVE WOULD-BE SERB RETURNEES OF </p><p>HABITATION.  THEY OBSERVED A WIDE PATTERN OF DESTRUCTION </p><p>OF REMOTE SERB HOMES AND VILLAGES WHILE TRADITIONAL </p><p>CROATIAN VILLAGES AS WELL AS LARGER POPULATION CENTERS </p><p>(E.G., KNIN, VRILKA, DRNIS) WERE SPARED, POSSIBLY AS </p><p>POTENTIAL HOUSING FOR RETURNING CROATIANS DISPLACED IN </p><p>1991-92.  (COMMENT:  IN ADDITION TO THE UN AND ECMM </p><p>COMMENTS, EMBOFFS WITH WARNER AND KERREY SAW SEVERAL </p><p>RECENTLY BURNED HOUSES AND VILLAGES IN THE AREA OF KNIN. </p><p>APPROXIMATELY 80 - 90 PERCENT OF BUILDINGS ALONG THE ROAD </p><p>THROUGH DRNIS - KNIN - VRPOLJE - KIJEVO HAD BEEN BURNED. </p><p>EMBOFFS SAW TWO FIRES IN DRNIS AND OTHERS ALONG THE ROAD. </p><p>IN SOME AREAS THE AIR SMELLED OF RECENTLY-BURNED </p><p>BUILDINGS.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>6.  KILLINGS:  IN ADDITION TO HOUSE-BURNING INCIDENTS, </p><p>THE UN HUMAN RIGHTS CENTER REPRESENTATIVE, E.J. FLYNN, </p><p>AND THE ECMM REP RECOUNTED CHILLING CASES OF APPARENT </p><p>MURDER OF UNARMED SERBS AFTER THE CROATIAN MILITARY </p><p>OPERATION WAS COMPLETE.  IN ONE INSTANCE IN A REMOTE </p><p>RURAL AREA, A CANADIAN UN OFFICER OBSERVED HV SOLDIERS </p><p>POSING FOR A PHOTO WITH AN ELDERLY SERB, "DISPLAYING HIM </p><p>LIKE A HUNTING TROPHY."  SOME TIME LATER, THE SERB WAS </p><p>FOUND IN A NEARBY FIELD WITH A BULLET IN HIS HEAD.  IN </p><p>ANOTHER INSTANCE, AN UNARMED SERB WAS ESCORTED BEHIND A </p><p>HOUSE BY HV TROOPS, AND LATER FOUND THERE WITH HIS HEAD </p><p>SHATTERED BY A BULLET.  THE BODY REMAINS LEANING AGAINST </p><p>A WOODPILE, ACCORDING TO THE EC MONITOR.  IN A THIRD CASE </p><p>RECOUNTED AFTER THE BRIEFING TO AN EMBOFF BY A CANADIAN </p><p>UN OFFICER, AN ELDERLY SERB MAN CAME TO THE UN COMPOUND </p><p>IN KNIN AT NIGHT SEEKING PROTECTION FOR HIMSELF AND HIS </p><p>                   LIMITED OFFICIAL USE </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       LIMITED OFFICIAL USE </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  03309  02 OF 03  301521Z </p><p>WIFE.  WHEN UN OFFICERS WENT AT DAWN WITH THE MAN TO HIS </p><p>HOME, THE WIFE\'S BODY WAS FOUND IN THE COUPLE\'S WELL. </p><p> </p><p>7.  FLYNN ALSO DISCUSSED EARLY UN REPORTS OF A POSSIBLE </p><p>"MASS GRAVE" AT KNIN CEMETERY.  ALTHOUGH THOSE INITIAL </p><p>REPORTS ARE NOW OPEN TO QUESTION, FLYNN OPINED THAT THE </p><p>PLACEMENT OF INDIVIDUAL GRAVE MARKERS ON THE SUSPECT SITE </p><p>MAY BE ONLY "COSMETIC COVER."  FLYNN INDICATED THAT HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS CASES ARE BEING DOCUMENTED AND WILL BE REVIEWED BY </p><p>THE INTERNATIONAL WAR CRIMES TRIBUNAL AT THE HAGUE. </p><p> </p><p>8.  DISPLACED PERSONS:  ALTHOUGH THE MAJORITY OF </p><p>DISPLACED SERBS HAVE NOW DEPARTED KRAJINA, 760 SERB </p><p>DISPLACED PERSONS ARE STILL TAKING REFUGEE IN THE UN </p><p>COMPOUND IN KNIN.
