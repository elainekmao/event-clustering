<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 001933 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT PASS CHENGDU FOR INFO </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/REIDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/03/2012 </p><p>TAGS: CH, NP, PGOV, CASC, ASEC, Tibetan Refugees </p><p>SUBJECT: REFUGEES CONFIRM DETAILS OF SHOOTING INCIDENT AT </p><p>NEPAL-CHINESE BORDER </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. KATHMANDU 1877 </p><p> </p><p>     B. KATHMANDU 1902 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Malinowski for reasons 1.5 (b)(d) </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) PolOff met with UNHCR Protection Officer regarding a </p><p>group of Tibetans involved in the incident near Nangpa-La in </p><p>which two American climbers were fired upon by unknown </p><p>individuals.  Neither American was injured in the encounter </p><p>(refs). Information related by the refugees is consistent </p><p>with reports received from the American climbers and via </p><p>e-mail from a journalist in touch with a separate group of </p><p>climbers on the Chinese side of the border.  Taken together, </p><p>the reports appear to confirm that several members of a </p><p>Chinese security force entered Nepal in pursuit of Tibetan </p><p>refugees.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>CLIMBERS REPORT ALTERCATION NEAR CHO OYU; </p><p>REFUGEES TELL SAME STORY </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) On October 2, ConOff received e-mail from Brot </p><p>Coburn, a climber, author and journalist with extensive </p><p>experience in Nepal.  Coburn\'s e-mail related September 19 </p><p>events on the Chinese side of Cho Oyu, a mountain situated on </p><p>Nepal\'s border with the Tibet Autonomous Region near the </p><p>almost 17,000-foot Nangpa-La pass.  According to Coburn, two </p><p>climbers ascending Cho Oyu on the north side "encountered PLA </p><p>officers apparently shaking down 25-30 Tibetan refugees." </p><p>After a 30-year old woman was shot and killed, the refugees </p><p>disarmed the PLA soldiers and nearly stoned them to death. </p><p>They then "took off for Nepal over the Nangpa-La." </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) In response to PolOff inquiries, UNHCR expedited </p><p>interviews of Tibetan refugees newly arrived at the Tibetan </p><p>Resettlement Center (TRC) from the Solukhumbu region.  In an </p><p>October 4 meeting with PolOff, Roland Weil, UNHCR Protection </p><p>Officer (protect), related statements collected by his staff </p><p>that directly correspond to reports from the climbers. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Weil stated that according the the newly arrived </p><p>refugees, their group of 28 was on its way to Nepal but </p><p>stopped just short of the border when one woman became ill. </p><p>As they waited for her to recover, they were approached by </p><p>four members of the Chinese military who told them they were </p><p>not allowed to cross the border and began hitting the woman </p><p>who was ill.  When one soldier left, presumably for </p><p>reinforcements, the group of refugees attacked the three </p><p>remaining soldiers, took two of their weapons and, leaving </p><p>their belongings and the ill refugee behind, fled for the </p><p>Nepali border.  The refugees state that when they left, the </p><p>Chinese military personnel were alive but badly beaten. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) The refugees further stated that the group split up </p><p>when a sixteen-year-old girl became fatigued.  She and two </p><p>men took one of the captured guns and continued toward Namche </p><p>Bazar at a slower pace than the main group.  Not long after, </p><p>the trio became aware of four Chinese soldiers descending </p><p>from the pass behind them, wearing civilian attire over their </p><p>military uniforms.  The three refugees hid in the rocks and </p><p>waited for the four soldiers to pass, but were later spotted </p><p>by a fifth soldier, travelling alone.  The three refugees </p><p>exchanged gunfire with the lone soldier until running out of </p><p>ammunition, at which time they dropped the weapon and fled. </p><p>They stated that as they continued their descent, they saw </p><p>two foreign climbers on the same trail, and later saw the </p><p>packs of the two foreign climbers lying on the ground.  The </p><p>three refugees stated that they never encountered again the </p><p>four soldiers that they had let pass.  Members of the main </p><p>group reported that they buried their captured weapon and </p><p>reached Namche Bazar without further incident. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Weil stated that his staff advised the refugees not to </p><p>spread the story, and that UNHCR would expedite the transfer </p><p>of the group of refugees to India in order to avoid </p><p>entangling them in a lengthy investigation by the GON.  He </p><p>indicated that twenty-four of the refugees are currently in </p><p>the TRC and stated that of the remaining four, one was left </p><p>behind in China, two did not have bus fare and so are walking </p><p>to Kathmandu, and one was unaccounted for.  PolOff advised </p><p>Weil that Morton and Lamoureaux, the AmCit climbers involved </p><p>in the shooting incident, had found a lone refugee claiming </p><p>to have been part of the group, and that the refugee had </p><p>later died on the trail. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>INFORMATION CONSISTENT WITH EARLIER REPORTS </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) In their September 30 meeting with EmbOffs (ref B), </p><p>AmCit climbers Morton and Lamoureaux related details of their </p><p>encounter with unidentified individuals that correspond in </p><p>large measure to the reports by the refugees and the climbers </p><p>at Cho Oyu.  According to Morton and Lamoureaux, the armed </p><p>men they encountered were wearing military uniforms under </p><p>civilian clothes, and one stated that he was a member of the </p><p>Chinese military.  The two AmCits reported that they dropped </p><p>their packs when running from the shooting, a detail </p><p>mentioned by the refugees at the TRC, and that they had </p><p>encountered a refugee claiming to have been part of a group </p><p>of around 30 people.  They said that they Chief of Police in </p><p>Namche Bazar later informed them that a group of approxiately </p><p>30 Tibetans had crossed Nangpa-La on September 19. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) The reports by climbers and statements taken from </p><p>Tibetan refugees appear to indicate that a highly unusual </p><p>series of events may have led Chinese military personnel to </p><p>enter Nepal and fire on American citizens.  Less clear are </p><p>reasons for the military personnel to fire on Morton and </p><p>Lamoureaux. Post can only speculate that the soldiers had </p><p>expected their movement would go unnoticed in the extremely </p><p>isolated area around Nangpa-La, and were startled by </p><p>potential witnesses.  Post does not believe that the </p><p>circumstances of the incident will affect any other American </p><p>citizens. Ambassador Malinowski has raised the issue with the </p><p>Foreign Secretary in an October 3 meeting, and RSO addressed </p><p>the topic with the Inspector General of Police on October 1. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
