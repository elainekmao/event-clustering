<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 001107 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF/W, INR AND EB </p><p>STATE PASS USTR </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/26/2008 </p><p>TAGS: EPET, ENRG, ELAB, PINS, PGOV, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: NLC THREATENS GENERAL STRIKE OVER FUEL </p><p>PRICE HIKE </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA 01091 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter; Reasons 1.5 (B) and </p><p>(D) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY: The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) called on </p><p>June 24 for a nationwide strike beginning Monday June 30 to </p><p>protest the GON\'s fuel price hike.  Some in the NLC </p><p>leadership were lukewarm about a strike; however, the </p><p>decision was no surprise.  The Union\'s long standing and </p><p>perhaps its most well known position on any public policy was </p><p>to oppose any fuel price hike on which it was not consulted. </p><p>In raising fuel prices last week, the GON bypassed the NLC. </p><p>Since the GON ignored labor, the Union had no choice but to </p><p>strike, according to labor officials.  The anticipated strike </p><p>may pose a compound challenge for the Government.  Not only </p><p>must it contend with the NLC and public anger over the price </p><p>hike, the Government must also expect that opposition </p><p>politicians, still smarting over the April elections, will </p><p>try to exploit the situation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sporadic Protests </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) According to press reports and Embassy sources, last </p><p>week\'s fuel price hike has generated localized protests and </p><p>fisticuffs in a few cities.  Students in Ibadan, the Yoruba </p><p>southwest and Obasanjo\'s political backyard, blocked </p><p>intersections, burned tires and shouted anti-Obasanjo </p><p>slogans.  In Kano, there were scuffles in fuel queues. There </p><p>was also a small peaceful protest in Abuja on June 23. </p><p>Transportation workers have vowed to join in any labor action </p><p>to protest the hike. The National Association of Road </p><p>Transport Owners threatened to halt all long distance bus </p><p>operations in the country until fuel prices are lowered. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Opposition Figures Welcome A Strike </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Opposition figures are enamored with prospects of a </p><p>national strike.  They will hope to ride labor\'s coattails to </p><p>exploit the strike for their own objectives.  Having called </p><p>for mass protest against the Government but not finding a way </p><p>to stoke it, these politicians believe the price increase has </p><p>provided a perfect filip.  Obasanjo and his allies are not </p><p>unaware of the risks.  They likely will employ both the </p><p>carrot and stick to douse labor\'s ardor and to keep their </p><p>political opposition fragmented and off-balance. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GON VS. NLC--Round Three </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  When the GON raised fuel prices in June 2000 and </p><p>January 2002, it also refused to accede to labor\'s demands to </p><p>rescind or lower the price increase. In 2000, the NLC </p><p>successfully orchestrated a strike, causing government to </p><p>soften the price increase.  In 2002, the strike fizzled </p><p>quickly; government refused to reduce the new price. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Again, the NLC has called for a strike due to a gas </p><p>price increase.  This puts the NLC leadership on the line. </p><p>Already this year, the NLC has been unpersuasive in getting </p><p>the GON to honor a 12.5% wage increases as agreed upon early </p><p>last year. Some NLC members have grumbled that the Congress\' </p><p>leadership did not press hard enough for the wage increase. </p><p>They fear NLC President Adams Oshiomole has gotten too cozy </p><p>with President Obasanjo.  Now that the strike is on, they </p><p>will be watching closely to see who--Oshiomole or </p><p>Obasanjo--blinks first.  If it is Oshiomole, they will cry </p><p>betrayal.  However, that would be unfair to the labor </p><p>stalwart.  Labor as a whole does not seem enthusiastic about </p><p>the strike.  They feel compelled to take it because the </p><p>Government ignored the NLC when it announced the price hike. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) The NLC is probably delaying the strike until Monday </p><p>to allow public sentiment to foment, in hopes that the GON be </p><p>more amenable to negotiation.  Additionally, the NLC has </p><p>traditionally struck on Mondays, because people have been </p><p>more likely to stay home, in effect, extending their </p><p>weekends. It seems highly unlikely that the GON will rescind </p><p>or reduce the increase by Monday.  Thus, the NLC will likely </p><p>strike.  There will be popular support but to what extent is </p><p>hard to divine.  If the strike gains traction, Obasanjo would </p><p>be faced with the first crisis of his Administration without </p><p>a Cabinet, including a Minister of Labor, in place. This </p><p>might not only be Obasanjo\'s third showdown with labor over </p><p>fuel prices (2000 and 2002 being the other).  This might be </p><p>the first test of the tensile strength of Obasanjo\'s second </p><p>term mandate. END COMMENT. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
