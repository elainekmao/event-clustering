<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 002701 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>TRANSPORTATION FOR KEVIN SAMPLE </p><p>BRUSSELS FOR JAMES BURRELL </p><p>ATHENS FOR FAA </p><p>ROME FOR INS </p><p>COMMERCE ALSO FOR ADVOCACY CENTER </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAIR, ASEC, ECON, BEXP, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: KEEPING THE DIALOGUE GOING: AMBASSADOR, </p><p>AVIATION MINISTER REVIEW SECURITY POSTURE AT LAGOS AIRPORT, </p><p>OTHER AVIATION ISSUES </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but Unclassified -- Protect Accordingly </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Introduction and Summary:  Ambassador discussed with </p><p>Aviation Minister Kema Chikwe security procedures at Murtala </p><p>Muhammad International Airport (MMIA), the requirements that </p><p>needed to be met before U.S. INS assistance can be reinstated </p><p>at MMIA, the distribution to Nigerian air carriers of the FBI </p><p>watch list, an effort by World Airways to extend wet-lease </p><p>service to Nigeria, and the difficulties Lockheed Martin </p><p>allegedly has confronted in submitting a bid to the Ministry </p><p>for radar equipment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Minister Chikwe deeply regretted the recent incident </p><p>when an INS official was assaulted at MMIA and pledged to </p><p>provide more security personnel at South African Airways </p><p>(SAA) check-in and boarding areas.  She also promised to </p><p>establish a Magistrate Court at the airport to prosecute </p><p>passengers who present fraudulent documents. Although no </p><p>Nigerian carriers currently offer direct air service to the </p><p>U.S., an unclassified version of the FBI watch list was </p><p>provided to the Minster. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) The Minister refused to confirm whether the Ministry </p><p>had approved a request by World Airways to offer U.S. to </p><p>Lagos  service; instead, she echoed a familiar refrain about </p><p>how the foreign operators posed an unfair challenge to her </p><p>effort to revive (moribund) Nigerian Airways. The Minister </p><p>stated Lockheed Martin had not submitted a tender bid on an </p><p>air navigation system but had instead sent a Memorandum of </p><p>Agreement that the Ministry found unacceptable.  She said </p><p>Lockheed Martin did not appear "serious" about bidding on the </p><p>project, but the Ministry would in any case extend the bid </p><p>deadline to November 15 to try to accommodate them.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>INS Assistance to SAA: How to Get It Back </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) On October 9, Ambassador Jeter, accompanied by </p><p>Econoff, conveyed to Minister Chikwe the results of his </p><p>recent discussions with the INS Commissioner and other INS </p><p>Officials in Washington. The Ambassador explained that the </p><p>September 7 incident at MMIA (when an INS official had been </p><p>physically assaulted during screening procedures) </p><p>demonstrated the need for more active airport security in the </p><p>screening process.  INS would not be able to assist Nigerian </p><p>Immigration Service or SAA security personnel, the Ambassador </p><p>emphasized, without Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria </p><p>(FAAN) guarantees of the safety of INS personnel and a signed </p><p>bilateral MOU. INS and the Department of State, the </p><p>Ambassador noted, were working on the terms of a proposed MOU </p><p>which would provide the parameters of INS assistance at MMIA. </p><p>But he reiterated the INS officers would limit their </p><p>assistance to screening documents. If INS officials were to </p><p>return to MMIA, they would only serve in an advisory capacity </p><p>and not have the power to retain suspected malafide </p><p>documents, either U.S. or Nigerian. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Minister Chikwe was visibly upset about the </p><p>September 7 incident. She admitted that she was personally </p><p>unhappy with FAAN security since they were not standing by to </p><p>intervene when passengers threatened immigration officials, </p><p>airline staff, or other passengers. She also agreed FAAN </p><p>security officers should be responsible for retaining </p><p>suspected fraudulent documents, handed to them by immigration </p><p>officers. The Minister announced she planned to inaugurate </p><p>this month a Magistrate\'s Court at MMIA to prosecute cases of </p><p>document fraud, "touting", and other crimes. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Shortly thereafter, Minster Chikwe called in FAAN\'s </p><p>Managing Director to demand he supply additional security </p><p>officers at the SAA check-in and boarding areas. She invited </p><p>the FAAN Aviation Security Officer and Director of Airport </p><p>Operations to discuss altering the physical terminal layout </p><p>of the immediate SAA check-in area to separate passengers </p><p>from non-passengers. Although the FAAN officers noted they </p><p>were understaffed, they agreed to provide additional officers </p><p>at both SAA check-in and boarding. The officials suggested </p><p>adding desks at the boarding gate to conduct document </p><p>screening immediately before passenger departure. The </p><p>Minister then appealed to the Ambassador to bring INS back to </p><p>MMIA. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>FAA Airport Security Inspection </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>7. (SBU) The Ambassador reviewed with Minister Chikwe the </p><p>results of a recent FAA assessment on how SAA and FAAN were </p><p>complying with new ICAO/FAA security directives. On September </p><p>28, visiting FAA Aviation Specialist James Burrell determined </p><p>that SAA and FAAN were generally in compliance with the FAA </p><p>security directives. However, Burrell was concerned that the </p><p>physical layout of the screening area hindered airport staff </p><p>from inspecting passengers and their baggage continually as </p><p>the FAA directives require. He recommended that FAAN provide </p><p>additional tables to perform baggage inspection. Burrell had </p><p>also noted that Pathfinder, SAA\'s security contractor, did </p><p>not adequately pre-inspect the airplane cabin before allowing </p><p>passengers to board. Minister Chikwe concurred positively to </p><p>all these points. She agreed to discuss how to redesign the </p><p>check-in area to facilitate check-in and baggage screening. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>The FBI Watch-list </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) The Ambassador inquired whether airlines operating </p><p>from Nigeria had access to the latest FBI Watch-List. The </p><p>Minster responded that she was uncertain whether all airlines </p><p>had the Watch-List. She herself did not have a copy but </p><p>assumed that the Nigerian State Security Service (SSS) would </p><p>have it. (Comment: They do. Post later delivered a </p><p>non-sensitive copy of the list to the Minister. End Comment.) </p><p>Ambassador pointed out that the FAA had distributed the list </p><p>to the headquarters of airlines with direct flights to the </p><p>U.S., including to SAA Headquarters in Johannesburg. SAA is </p><p>currently the only carrier flying direct between Nigeria and </p><p>the U.S. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>Status of SAA-NA Flight Agreement and World Airways </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) Ambassador Jeter inquired whether government-owned </p><p>Nigerian Airways (NA) would likely extend its partnership </p><p>with South African Airways on service to JFK. The Minister </p><p>commented that Nigerian Airways (read: the Minister) is not </p><p>happy with the partnership. Many here, she noted, blame South </p><p>African Airways for allegedly refusing to treat a Nigerian </p><p>man who died on board the flight.  This incident, the </p><p>Minister said, may influence the Ministry to review very </p><p>carefully an agreement to extend the Nigerian Airways/South </p><p>African Airways partnership for another two years. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) Jeter informed the Minister that U.S. Department of </p><p>Transportation had just granted approval to World Airways to </p><p>wet-lease airplanes to an unnamed African carrier for service </p><p>between Lagos and either New York, Baltimore, or Atlanta. </p><p>While not saying whether the GON had approved the route, the </p><p>Minister instead returned to an old refrain about how </p><p>competing service further challenges the "revitalization" of </p><p>Nigerian Airways.  She further criticized the International </p><p>Finance Corporation (IFC) because it did not want the GON to </p><p>invest in the carrier. Instead, she inferred, the IFC wanted </p><p>the Ministry to run Nigerian Airways into the ground so </p><p>foreign carriers could benefit from the privatization of the </p><p>airline. She admitted that "a culture of mismanagement and </p><p>corruption" had destroyed NA, but she argued the airline only </p><p>needed "technical assistance and good management." She </p><p>concluded by saying that the reason the National Assembly </p><p>chose to phase in Open Skies until 2006 was to provide </p><p>Nigerian Airways breathing space from competition from </p><p>foreign carriers. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>Lockheed Martin Bid for Radar Equipment </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU) Ambassador Jeter informed the Minister that he had </p><p>received an inquiry from Lockheed Martin regarding a bid they </p><p>made on radar contracts with the Ministry. According to the </p><p>company, the Ministry had "ignored" Lockheed\'s bid although </p><p>the company had beaten an "impossible" (September 16) </p><p>deadline to submit their proposal. Furthermore, Lockheed </p><p>Martin believed the Ministry had requested bids for a </p><p>regional air navigation system, but the Ministry later </p><p>informed them that it only wanted radar equipment and </p><p>installation services. Lockheed claimed it had also submitted </p><p>a Memorandum of Agreement to finance the cost of the </p><p>equipment and services. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (SBU) The Minister claimed she had not received a bid </p><p>from Lockheed Martin.  Moreover, the proposed Memorandum of </p><p>Agreement was unacceptable because the GON was unwilling to </p><p>guarantee a loan to purchase the equipment. The Ministry, she </p><p>said, had extended the bid deadline to October 15, but still </p><p>had not received a bid from Lockheed Martin who, she </p><p>asserted, was "not serious".  Chikwe claimed the company </p><p>wanted to come to Nigeria to survey the airport so that they </p><p>could determine the best air navigation system for Nigeria. </p><p>The Ministry was determined to purchase a system capable of </p><p>being integrated with navigation systems elsewhere in West </p><p>Africa which would allow Nigeria to become a hub for regional </p><p>air traffic. She indicated several bids had been received by </p><p>the Ministry, including from Marconi and British Aerospace. </p><p>However, the Ministry now planned to extend the deadline to </p><p>November 15 and Lockheed Martin still had an opportunity to </p><p>submit a bid on the air navigation system. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p>Comment: Keeping the Momentum on Security Enhancement at MMIA </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (SBU) The Minister appeared to be very determined to </p><p>resolve the outstanding security issues at MMIA and provide </p><p>the proper environment for INS\'s return.  But this is not the </p><p>first time the subject of MMIA security has been discussed </p><p>with the Minister and we will continue to monitor events </p><p>closely at the airport for signs of improvement.  A </p><p>suggestion by the Ambassador for senior USG, GON, and South </p><p>African High Commission officials to observe activities at </p><p>the SAA counter and boarding gate was very well received.  We </p><p>do note that despite the security problems cited above, the </p><p>GON has made tremendous strides in improving the overall </p><p>security and safety posture at MMIA over the last two years. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. (SBU) Chikwe\'s criticism of SAA should be placed in </p><p>context. Neither SAA nor the GON has treated the relationship </p><p>like a newly wedded couple. However, both airlines appear to </p><p>be making money and continued direct service to the U.S. is a </p><p>top priority for the GON.  The first anniversary of the </p><p>SAA/NA service is in February and posturing by the GON to </p><p>obtain concessions from SAA may be behind Chikwe\'s </p><p>statements.  Meanwhile, privatization of Nigerian Airways </p><p>keeps moving backwards.  The new date to privatize Nigerian </p><p>Airways is set for December 2002.  However, even before the </p><p>events of September 11, the future of Nigerian Airways was at </p><p>best tenuous.  We are doubtful if Nigerian Airways will meet </p><p>the new deadline.  The International Finance Corporation, </p><p>which earlier this year relinquished its advisory role on </p><p>Nigerian Airways privatization, opposed the delays, </p><p>interference, and other hurdles put in the way of Nigerian </p><p>Airways privatization process. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
