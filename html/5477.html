Reason: 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) We understand that Washington agencies have been </p><p>working hard over the past few weeks to develop a trade </p><p>package that we could offer to Turkey as part of our effort </p><p>to get the Turks to "yes" on Iraq.  From our limited point of </p><p>view, this is decision week.  If we are to influence Turkey\'s </p><p>decision positively, we need to present as substantive a </p><p>package as possible in the next few days, prior to a possible </p><p>Turkish Parliament debate on Friday. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  As we understand it, the package under discussion </p><p>includes: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- A commitment to submit to Congress revised QIZ </p><p>legislation, which would completely drop the existing </p><p>footwear, leather, and flatware exclusions, and allow textile </p><p>QIZs subject to minimum levels of U.S. product input; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Allowing Turkey to participate in the 807/809 program, </p><p>under which Turkish garments could be exported quota-free to </p><p>the United States provided they included minimum amounts of </p><p>U.S. fabric or yarn; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Approving Turkey\'s petition to authorize GSP benefits for </p><p>gold jewelry, and its petitions for redesignation of capers, </p><p>pignolia/pistachio nuts, and dried tomatoes.  Possibly also </p><p>seeking Congressional authorization for additional 2002 </p><p>products, including figs and dried apriocots; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) We strongly support offering "clean" QIZ legislation </p><p>and expanded GSP benefits, but we are less sure about the </p><p>807/809 program.  Turkey did ask for it in 1997, but our </p><p>discreet soundings reveal little interest in it now.  To </p><p>ensure our package brings the greatest possible political </p><p>benefits, Embassy strongly recommends that Washington offer </p><p>textile quota shifts, with an estimated value of $60 million, </p><p>in addition to the 807/809 program.  The combination of quota </p><p>shifts and GSP benefits on gold jewelry -- with a combined </p><p>estimated value of some $150 million in additional exports -- </p><p>would make the package tangible, and therefore of much </p><p>greater benefit to our broader efforts here. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) We also recommend that the package include points </p><p>reiterating our willingness to discuss an FTA if the GOT can </p><p>confirm its ability/willingness to pursue a comprehensive </p><p>agreement within the parameters of its Customs Union with the </p><p>EU, as well as forward-leaning points on our intention to </p><p>promote U.S.-Turkish business partnerships in a possible Iraq </p><p>reconstruction effort (along the lines of existing </p><p>cooperation on Afghan reconstruction). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
