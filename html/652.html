FOLLOWING IS OUR CONTRIBUTION FOR THE ANNUAL </p><p>CSCE IMPLEMENTATION REPORT (REFTEL). </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>GENERAL ASSESSMENT </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  CROATIA CONTINUES BY AND LARGE TO IMPLEMENT </p><p>ITS CSCE OBLIGATIONS, THOUGH THERE HAVE BEEN </p><p>SOME INCIDENTS IN VIOLATION OF CSCE NORMS.  THE </p><p>CONTINUED PREVALENCE OF UNSETTLED CONDITIONS -- </p><p>WAR, A HOSTILE OCCUPATION AND EFFECTIVE CIVIL </p><p>WAR, AND MAJOR REFUGEE FLOWS -- COMPLICATES THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S TASK AND MAKES THE SECURITY BASKET </p><p>ONCE AGAIN THE MAIN FOCUS OF DEVELOPMENTS THIS </p><p>YEAR. </p><p> </p><p>3. DEVELOPMENTS IN THE SECURITY AREA, INCLUDING </p><p>ESPECIALLY THE SIGNING OF A PEACE AGREEMENT WITH </p><p>NEIGHBORING BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA IN THE FIRST </p><p>QUARTER OF 1994, REFLECTED THE PURSUIT OF </p><p>RESPONSIBLE SECURITY POLICIES.  BEFORE THAT </p><p>THERE WERE, HOWEVER, SOME CASES OF CROATIAN </p><p>MILITARY OPERATIONS THAT VIOLATED CSCE NORMS. </p><p> </p><p>4. ROUGHLY A QUARTER OF CROATIA\'S TERRITORY IS </p><p>STILL MILITARILY OCCUPIED BY REBEL ETHNIC SERB </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  01327  01 OF 03  011807Z </p><p>FORCES THAT HAVE STRONG LINKS TO THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>OF THE "FRY."  THE POLICING OF THE OCCUPIED </p><p>AREAS BY THE UN PROTECTION FORCE (UNPROFOR) HAS </p><p>NOT SUCCEEDED COMPLETELY IN PREVENTING MILITARY </p><p>ATTACKS ON CROATIA FROM WITHIN THOSE AREAS, NOR </p><p>THE ABUSE AND HARASSMENT OF ETHNIC MINORITIES. </p><p>THE NUMBER OF NEW REFUGEES FLOWING INTO CROATIA </p><p>DIMINISHED SOMEWHAT DURING THE YEAR, BUT THERE </p><p>HAS BEEN LITTLE CHANGE IN THE OVERALL NUMBERS OF </p><p>REFUGEES AND DISPLACED PERSONS IN THE COUNTRY </p><p>WHO MUST BE CARED FOR. </p><p> </p><p>5. IN OTHER CSCE AREAS, THERE WERE NO MAJOR </p><p>DEVELOPMENTS THIS YEAR.  KEY FEATURES OF THE </p><p>LANDSCAPE ARE CONTINUED BUT SLOW PROGRESS TOWARD </p><p>ECONOMIC PRIVATIZATION, MUCH SLOWED BY THE </p><p>UNCERTAIN INVESTMENT CONDITIONS; AND A GENERAL </p><p>RESPECT FOR THE PRINCIPLES EMBODIED IN THE HUMAN </p><p>DIMENSION, MARRED BY CONTINUING PROBLEMS </p><p>CONCERNING THE RIGHTS OF MINORITIES AND PRESS </p><p>FREEDOMS, IN PARTICULAR. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>SECURITY </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>6. SECURITY ISSUES DOMINATE ALL OTHER MATTERS IN </p><p>CROATIA, DUE TO THE CONTINUING MILITARY </p><p>OCCUPATION OF LARGE PARTS OF THE COUNTRY BY </p><p>BREAKAWAY ETHNIC SERBS.  IN 1993, THE UNSC </p><p>RECOGNIZED THESE "UN-PROTECTED AREAS" (UNPAS) AS </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  01327  01 OF 03  011807Z </p><p>INTEGRAL PARTS OF CROATIA.  CROATIA CONTINUED TO </p><p>COOPERATE IN INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS TO NORMALIZE </p><p>THE UNPAS AND RETURN THEM TO CROATIAN GOVERNMENT </p><p>CONTROL, BY PEACEFUL MEANS, IN PARTICULAR BY </p><p>PROLONGING ITS AGREEMENT TO THE PRESENCE OF UN </p><p>PEACEKEEPING TROOPS AND BY COOPERATING IN OTHER </p><p>EFFORTS TO ESTABLISH A FRAMEWORK FOR A PEACEFUL </p><p>APPROACH TO THE RETURN OF THE UNPAS (SEE </p><p>BELOW).  THERE WERE ALSO BREACHES, HOWEVER, </p><p>NOTABLY IN CROATIAN ATTEMPTS IN SEPTEMBER 1993 </p><p>TO RETAKE BY FORCE CERTAIN SERB-CONTROLLED AREAS </p><p>AROUND MEDAK.  IN ADDITION TO MANY CASUALTIES ON </p><p>BOTH SIDES, THERE WAS EVIDENCE OF THE TORTURE </p><p>AND MURDER OF SERB CIVILIANS, THE CROATIAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATION OF WHICH HAS NOT YET </p><p>BEEN COMPLETED.  CROATIA HAS NOW ENTERED INTO </p><p>SERIOUS NEGOTIATIONS, WHICH WERE UNDER WAY AS </p><p>THE REPORTING PERIOD CLOSED, FOR A CEASEFIRE </p><p>WITH THE SERBS WHO CONTROL MOST OF THE UNPAS. </p><p> </p><p>7.  INTERNATIONALLY, CROATIA SIGNED AN AGREEMENT </p><p>IN MARCH 1994 THAT WILL HELP BRING PEACE TO THE </p><p>FORMER YUGOSLAVIA BY ESTABLISHING A CROAT-MUSLIM </p><p>FEDERATION IN BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA AND A </p><p>CONFEDERATION BETWEEN THE B-H FEDERATION AND </p><p>CROATIA.

ALSO IN THE </p><p>FIRST QUARTER OF 1994, THE CROATIAN GOVERMENT </p><p>COOPERATED IN BRINGING ABOUT A CEASEFIRE BETWEEN </p><p>ETHNIC CROATIAN AND MUSLIM FORCES IN </p><p>BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA, THUS HELPING TO REDUCE </p><p>VIOLENCE.  A MAJOR PROBLEM IN THE SAME AREA, </p><p>HOWEVER, HAS BEEN THE CROATIAN GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>CONTINUED ACCEPTANCE OF A PRACTICE BY WHICH </p><p>CROATIAN REGULAR TROOPS WERE INVOLVED IN </p><p>FIGHTING IN BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA. </p><p> </p><p>8. CROATIA COOPERATES IN THE UN EFFORT TO </p><p>ENFORCE A NO-FLY ZONE OVER B-H AND CONSISTENTLY </p><p>GRANTS OVERFLIGHT CLEARANCE FOR AIRCRAFT </p><p>INVOLVED IN THAT EFFORT.  IT HAS, HOWEVER, </p><p>ITSELF VIOLATED THE NFZ.  INFORMATION PROVIDED </p><p>ON CROATIAN MILITARY FORCES PURSUANT TO VD-92 </p><p>HAS BEEN INCOMPLETE. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>ECONOMIC </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  CROATIA CONTINUES TO MOVE, ALBEIT SLOWLY, </p><p>AWAY FROM THE SYSTEM OF STATE OWNERSHIP THAT </p><p>PREVAILED UNTIL 1991 TOWARD A FREE-MARKET </p><p>SYSTEM.  PRIVATIZATION CONTINUES, THOUGH MOST </p><p>EFFORTS HAVE BEEN ON A SMALL SCALE.  PROGRESS </p><p>HAS BEEN UNEVEN AND SLOW BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  01327  02 OF 03  011808Z </p><p>HAS BEEN PREOCCUPIED WITH THE WAR AND ITS </p><p>EFFECTS, SO THAT MANY NEW RULES AN LAWS REMAIN </p><p>TO BE PASSED.  FORMER EXPORT MARKETS REMAIN </p><p>LARGELY CLOSED OFF AND HAVE NOT BEEN REPLACED, </p><p>AND THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE.  AS A RESULT, ECONOMIC </p><p>RECOVERY HAS BEEN BLOCKED AND THE AVERAGE </p><p>STANDARD OF LIVING REMAINS AT LEAST 50 PERCENT </p><p>BELOW ITS PRE-1991 LEVEL.  FURTHER, THE </p><p>UNCERTAIN SECURITY SITUATION HAS PROBABLY CAUSED </p><p>INVESTORS, BOTH DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN, TO </p><p>POSTPONE THEIR DECISIONS. </p><p> </p><p>10.  A NEW ECONOMIC TEAM INSTALLED BY PRESIDENT </p><p>TUDJMAN INTRODUCED IN OCTOBER 1993 MEASURES THAT </p><p>LARGELY HALTED THE RAMPANT INFLACTION PREVAILING </p><p>LAST YEAR, AND THIS HAS MADE A SIGNIFICANT </p><p>CONTRIBUTION TO STABILIZING THE ECONOMIC </p><p>SITUATION.  CROATIA REMAINS A MEMBER OF THE </p><p>WORLD BANK, IMF, AND ETRD AND HAS RECEIVED </p><p>TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FROM THESE INSTITUTIONS TO </p><p>HELP STRENGTHEN ITS FREE MARKET BASE.  THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT HAS OBTAINED U.S. AND EUROPEAN UNION </p><p>SUPPORT FOR EVENTUAL CLOSER ASSOCIATION WITH </p><p>WESTERN ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>11.  BECAUSE OF UNSETTLED CONDITIONS AND HIGHER </p><p>PRIORITIES, CROATIAN ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION </p><p>POLICY REMAINS IN ITS INFANCY BUT FOLLOWS IN </p><p>PRINCIPLE THE LINES OF WESTERN PRACTICE. </p><p>CROATIA AND THE U.S. SIGNED AN AGREEMENT ON </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  01327  02 OF 03  011808Z </p><p>SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL EXCHANGE IN MARCH  . </p><p>1994. </p><p> </p><p>---------------                                 . </p><p>HUMAN DIMENSION </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  CROATIA HAS ENACTED MOST OR ALL OF THE </p><p>LEGAL STRUCTURES OF A PLURALISTIC, DEMOCRATIC </p><p>SOCIETY.  HOWEVER, THE GOVERNMENT APPEARS TO </p><p>HAVE LEFT THIS MACHINERY TO OPERATE ON ITS OWN, </p><p>AND HAS NOT BEEN ACTIVE IN EXTENDING ITS </p><p>PRACTICAL AND FAIR APPLICATION, NOR AGGRESSIVE </p><p>IN ENSURING THAT ABUSES ARE AVOIDED. </p><p> </p><p>13.  ELECTIONS IN EARLY 1993 WERE GENERALLY </p><p>CONSIDERED FAIR AND OPEN BY BOTH OUTSIDE AND </p><p>DOMESTIC OBSERVERS AS WELL AS THE PARTICIPANTS. </p><p>BUT DEMOCRATIC, PLURALISTIC INSTITUTIONS ARE NOT </p><p>YET AS ROBUST AS IN OLDER WESTERN SOCIETIES. </p><p>THE SABOR (PARLIAMENT), FOR EXAMPLE, HAS LITTLE </p><p>       EFFECTIVE POWER TO CHALLENGE THE PRESIDENT OF </p><p>THE REPUBLIC.

CROATIA SHOWS A STRONG RESPECT, IN LETTER </p><p>AND IN PRACTICE, FOR INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS, AND </p><p>INCREASING INTERCHANGE WITH WESTERN EUROPEAN </p><p>SOCIE </p><p>TIES HAS BROUGHT A GREATER AWARENESS OF </p><p>GOVERNMENT OBLIGATIONS IN THIS REGARD.  THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT USUALLY TAKES ACTION TO INVESTIGATE </p><p>AND/OR PROSECUTE SERIOUS ABUSES, BUT RESPONSE </p><p>CAN BE SLOW AND INEFFECTIVE.  MINORITIES IN </p><p>CROATIA -- IN PARTICULAR THE ROUGHLY 11 PERCENT . </p><p>SERB MINORITY -- HAVE BEEN SUBJECT, AGAIN IN </p><p>1993, TO CRIMES OF VIOLENCE COMMITTED BY </p><p>NATIONALIST EXTREMISTS.  SERBIAN REPRESENTATIVES </p><p>ALSO COMPLAIN THAT THEY SUFFER DISCRIMINATION </p><p>AND HARASSMENT IN A WIDE VARIETY OF AREAS, FROM </p><p>ABNORMAL SLOWNESS IN THE ISSUANCE OF GOVERNMENT </p><p>DOCUMENTS TO DISCRIMINATION IN HIRING AND FIRING. </p><p> </p><p>15.
