<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 OTTAWA 000385 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR WHA/CAN - PATRICIA NORMAN, EB/TRA - SUSAN PARSONS </p><p> </p><p>STATE PASS USTR FOR JOHN MELLE </p><p> </p><p>USDOT FOR JEFF SHANE AND SUSAN MCDERMOTT </p><p> </p><p>FAA FOR KRISTA BEREQUIST </p><p> </p><p>TSA FOR SUSAN WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAIR, EINV, CA, Finance </p><p>SUBJECT: Air Canada\'s financial woes may spur GOC to alter fees </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.(U) Portions of this message are Sensitive But </p><p>Unclassified, please treat accordingly. </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Air Canada\'s fourth quarter losses in 2002 are </p><p>significant and have forced that airline to try to sell its </p><p>maintenance, ground handling and commuter-feeder airline </p><p>units. The federal government may reduce the air security </p><p>fee from C$24 to C$18 to boost air travel, but there are few </p><p>other options for federal cost cutting that can be passed on </p><p>to the airline sector and traveling public. In the wake of </p><p>global turbulence in the air travel sector, Air Canada and </p><p>Canada\'s other airlines will have to adapt and restructure </p><p>to the new market realities rather than rely on GOC </p><p>maneuvering. However, restructuring may prove difficult </p><p>unless the airline can attract foreign capital. End summary. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) After posting profits in the spring and summer of </p><p>2002, Air Canada, which accounts for more than 70 percent of </p><p>all air passenger travel in Canada, took a beating in the </p><p>last three months of 2002.  The airline lost C$364 million </p><p>dollars (US$239 million) in the period, compared to C$277 </p><p>million dollars (US$182 million) in the period in 2001.  To </p><p>stem its losses, the company intends to: 1) sell stakes in </p><p>its aircraft maintenance, ground handling and regional </p><p>airline units; 2) seek changes in work rules and other </p><p>concessions from its 36,000 employees, and 3) turn its cargo </p><p>operation, employing 1,700 people, into a separate </p><p>subsidiary. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) The troubles of Air Canada have led the Minister of </p><p>Transportation, David Collennette to consider reducing the </p><p>government imposed C$24 a ticket airline security fee and, </p><p>or, reduce other fees such as navigation system charges and </p><p>airport landing fees. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) According to Ministry of Finance officials the </p><p>lowest the security fee could be reduced to, and still meet </p><p>revenue needs given federally mandated aviation security </p><p>expenditures, is C$18.  An official with the Airline Pilots </p><p>Association (ALPA) in Ottawa is confident that the fee will </p><p>indeed be lowered, however, whether it will be reduced </p><p>across the board or will be prorated on distance flown, is </p><p>still up in the air. </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) The Minister\'s expostulations on reducing Navigation </p><p>fees and airport fees are much less certain. The entities </p><p>that collect these fees and provide the corresponding </p><p>services are private sector corporations that have not been </p><p>under federal government management since the mid- to late- </p><p>1990s.  These non-share corporations cannot raise equity </p><p>capital and must rely on fees and debt to finance their </p><p>activities (and all surplus funds must be reinvested in the </p><p>corporation). NAV Canada, which provides Canada\'s Air </p><p>Navigation Services, was spun out of the federal government </p><p>in 1996.  It owns its infrastructure assets and sets its </p><p>fees independent of the GOC. </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) The federal government, however, remains the owner of </p><p>Canada\'s major airports, although they are operated by </p><p>independent local "Airport Authorities" (and the GOC is paid </p><p>rent under sixty-year long lease arrangements). The airport </p><p>authorities\' fees and charges are not subject to review by </p><p>the GOC. In particular Airport Improvement Fees (AIF) </p><p>provide an attractive revenue source since passengers are </p><p>largely captive. All major Canadian airports have either </p><p>introduced AIFs or are in the process of doing so. Thus the </p><p>GOC cannot simply force the airport authorities or NAV </p><p>Canada to reduce fees - and unless the GOC provides </p><p>operating subsidies to these entities to make up for any </p><p>lost revenue there would be no incentive for them to do so. </p><p>In a best case scenario the GOC would have only the option </p><p>of reducing the rent it takes from the airport authorities </p><p>and hope that the airports would pass the savings along to </p><p>air travelers, perhaps by reducing AIFs. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) At this juncture the conventional wisdom among </p><p>airline industry observers is that the GOC is very unlikely </p><p>to engage in direct subsidies of NAV Canada and the airports </p><p>to save money for the airlines.  An overt bailout of Air </p><p>Canada, of the type seen in the United States post 9-11 is </p><p>also not on the table.  The big losses posted by Air Canada </p><p>this past quarter now places all of North America\'s "full </p><p>service" carriers in the same tough financial straits but, </p><p>despite the serious crisis in the industry, Minister </p><p>Collenette\'s only real option is to reduce the security fee. </p><p>Indeed, Collenette has inferred there is little the </p><p>government can do in the face of a global decline in air </p><p>travel in the wake of 9-11 - and it will be up to Air Canada </p><p>to continue to adapt and restructure to become profitable </p><p>under the new market conditions.  After all, the "low-cost" </p><p>model airlines (e.g. Southwest, Jet Blue, and Canada\'s </p><p>WestJet) are managing to make money. Embassy doubts whether </p><p>Air Canada will be able to raise enough cash by selling </p><p>assets to Canadian entities; a significant investment of </p><p>foreign capital in the Canadian aviation industry will be </p><p>vital to Air Canada\'s long-term health.  However, given the </p><p>current state of the industry, it is not clear where that </p><p>capital will be found. </p><p> </p><p>Kelly </p><p></p></div>
