REASON:  1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) The ceasefire between the Government of Nepal (GON) </p><p>and Maoist insurgents, declared on January 29, enters its </p><p>fourth month amid evidence that the Maoists continue to </p><p>train, recruit/conscript, and extort money from the local </p><p>population.  Violations of the code of conduct persist, with </p><p>the number of killings so far (15) topping the tally during </p><p>the 2001 ceasefire.  Relaxed restrictions during the </p><p>ceasefire have allowed the Maoists to increase their presence </p><p>in areas where they were less active and to continue to </p><p>intimidate the population in areas not under sustained GON </p><p>control.  In some areas, the Maoists continue to prohibit the </p><p>GON from re-establishing a presence and/or providing </p><p>services.  Meanwhile, there is a sense of drift in the peace </p><p>process.  Two rounds of talks have made little headway, and </p><p>with the June 4 change in government, built little confidence </p><p>toward a lasting peace.  Despite the Maoists\' ongoing </p><p>recruitment, training and "fund-raising," conventional wisdom </p><p>holds that the insurgents will not break the ceasefire, </p><p>especially so near the onset of monsoon weather.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>FOUR MONTHS AND COUNTING </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  The ceasefire between the Government of Nepal (GON) </p><p>and Maoist insurgents, declared on January 29, already has </p><p>surpassed the longevity of the 2001 ceasefire (July </p><p>23-November 26) and offers no signs of impending breakdown. </p><p>Thus far the current ceasefire has seen two rounds of </p><p>dialogue (three rounds were held in the 2001 ceasefire), two </p><p>prime ministers, and with the June 12 appointments of </p><p>Ministers Kamal Thapa and Prakash Lohani as negotiators (Ref </p><p>C), two different GON talk teams.  The two negotiating </p><p>sessions have made little apparent progress so far toward </p><p>lasting peace, and seem to have accomplished even less to </p><p>build confidence between the two sides--especially after the </p><p>GON\'s very public and  clumsy backpedaling on alleged </p><p>commitments to release prominent Maoist detainees and limit </p><p>patrolling by the Royal Nepal Army (RNA) (Ref A). No date has </p><p>yet been set for a third round of talks. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  Reports of violations of the ceasefire\'s code of </p><p>conduct continue.  According to the Informal Sector Service </p><p>Center (INSEC), a local human rights NGO, 15 people have been </p><p>killed since January 29, of which 6 were killed by GON </p><p>security forces and 9 by the Maoists.  (This compares with 7 </p><p>people--all victims of the Maoists--killed in the 2001 </p><p>ceasefire.)  The Royal Nepal Army (RNA) has reported two </p><p>clashes with armed Maoist cadres since the ceasefire, in </p><p>which soldiers killed one Maoist in Ramechhap on June 3 and </p><p>one in Okhaldunga on April 24.  INSEC also reports that 162 </p><p>people have been abducted by the Maoists since the beginning </p><p>of the ceasefire; 102 remain missing.  According to Rabi </p><p>Kanta Aryal, Assistant Inspector General of Police at the </p><p>National Police Headquarters\' Operations Center, many of </p><p>those abducted were alleged to be GON "informers" or tagged </p><p>with having committed social crimes by local Maoist </p><p>vigilantes.  (One police constable in Banke District, for </p><p>example, was kidnapped for having taken a second wife). </p><p>Others may have been "recruited" for service in Maoist </p><p>training camps. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  But if disappearances and killings have declined </p><p>during the ceasefire, extortion continues apace.  The </p><p>Maoists, according to Central Bank estimates, had netted a </p><p>total of nearly USD 6 million from assorted bank robberies </p><p>across the country before the ceasefire.  They have been </p><p>forced since January 29 to rely upon alternative methods of </p><p>fundraising--primarily extortion.  Although the Maoists </p><p>publicly claim that all such donations are willingly given by </p><p>an enthusiastic public, sources contacted report that threats </p><p>of "negative consequences" generally accompany the demands </p><p>for funds.  Large and small businessmen, civil servants, </p><p>teachers, and even local villagers are reportedly being </p><p>pressed for "donations" to help defray the upkeep of Maoist </p><p>cadres in the field.  Poor rural residents in outlying areas </p><p>not under GON control are "asked" to provide food and/or </p><p>shelter.  Those who attempt to resist the extortion demands </p><p>(whether out of principle or sheer economic exigency) are </p><p>sometimes beaten or abducted.  Even the prestigious Soaltee </p><p>Corporation (in which King Gyanendra is a partner) reportedly </p><p>has been contacted for contributions.  According to N.N. </p><p>Singh (protect), Country Manager for Coca-Cola and long-time </p><p>target of such demands, his Maoist contacts explain that </p><p>observing the ceasefire has cut off their more traditional </p><p>sources of income--like robbing banks--and that they thus are </p><p>forced to press the local population for resources.  When </p><p>Singh pointed out that such activities contradict the Maoist </p><p>negotiators\' public commitments to cease extortion, his </p><p>contact reportedly replied that he takes his instructions on </p><p>"fund-raising" from Maoist negotiator and Central Committee </p><p>member Krishna Bahadur Mahara.  (Note:  Despite the Maoists\' </p><p>repeated importunings and implied threats of "consequences," </p><p>Singh continues to resist their demands.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>CONSOLIDATING PRESENCE, </p><p>SPREADING MESSAGE </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)   Most sources contacted, including those working in </p><p>government, NGOs, political parties, and the police, note </p><p>that relaxed restrictions during the ceasefire have allowed </p><p>the Maoists to tighten their hold in many of the areas not </p><p>under GON control while permitting them to establish or </p><p>increase their presence in areas, like the southern Terai </p><p>plains, the East, and urban centers like Kathmandu where they </p><p>were not previously as active.  AIGP Aryal expressed alarm at </p><p>what he described as the spread of Maoists in the Terai, </p><p>which heretofore had been comparatively less affected by the </p><p>insurgency.  Subodh Pyakurel, General Secretary of INSEC, </p><p>reports that since the ceasefire the Maoists have banned </p><p>members of his organization from entering certain areas to </p><p>perform human rights monitoring.  No such restrictions were </p><p>placed on INSEC, which maintains local offices in all 75 </p><p>districts, during the previous ceasefire or even during the </p><p>state of emergency, Pyakurel observed.  He speculated that </p><p>the Maoists, who have reportedly reactivated the "people\'s </p><p>courts" that mete out summary "justice" to local miscreants, </p><p>do not want INSEC monitoring their vigilantism or reporting </p><p>their extortion campaigns.  He said that he has publicly </p><p>challenged the Maoist leadership to commit to international </p><p>human rights accords, but has received no reply.  Political </p><p>party leaders also report that in numerous areas the Maoists </p><p>continue to prohibit their workers from carrying out party </p><p>activities or holding meetings.  Similar restrictions have </p><p>not, however, been imposed on the insurgents, they complain, </p><p>who, now that their leaders are "above ground," have been </p><p>exploiting their new-found freedom to spread their political </p><p>message. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>OBSTRUCTING GOVERNMENT WORK </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) In many areas, the Maoists continue to prohibit GON </p><p>civil servants from carrying out their assigned duties as </p><p>well.  Ganga Datta Awasthi, Joint Secretary at the Ministry </p><p>of Local Development, cited the mid-western districts of </p><p>Kalikot, Achham, Rukum, Rolpa, and Jajarkot, as well as parts </p><p>of the far-western district of Bardiya, as the worst </p><p>affected.  In Rukum, Rolpa, and Jajarkot, the GON presence is </p><p>limited to district headquarters (although Maoist "people\'s </p><p>governments" in some parts of Jajarkot have cooperated with </p><p>GON health workers to provide some limited services).  In </p><p>Kalikot, local Maoist commanders in 17 of the 30 Village </p><p>Development Committees (the VDC is the smallest unit of local </p><p>government) have flatly barred any GON presence, including </p><p>from the only health posts available to the local population. </p><p> In Achham, civil servants are not allowed to enter </p><p>three-fourths of the VDCs in the district.  In Bardiya, </p><p>nearly one-third of the VDCs are off-limits to the GON. </p><p>(Note:  Along the Rajapur delta in Bardiya, the Maoists also </p><p>have hung posters banning any USG-funded NGO activity as </p><p>well.  End note.)  In Kavre--the district directly adjoining </p><p>Kathmandu--the anti-GON ban extends to about 20 percent of </p><p>the VDCs.  In Salyan, however, GON services are apparently </p><p>permitted on a selective basis, with health officers being </p><p>granted access and mobility but VDC Secretaries being told to </p><p>keep out.  Despite these restrictions, the overall situation </p><p>has improved markedly, said Awasthi, adding that the degree </p><p>of cooperation largely depends on the individual Maoist </p><p>commander in a particular area. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  Even in those VDCs where civil servants have been </p><p>permitted to return, most do not stay overnight, Awasthi </p><p>said, both out of fear of possible Maoist violence and </p><p>because the GON has not rebuilt any of the facilities </p><p>destroyed during the conflict.  (Note:  The Maoists have </p><p>destroyed about 40 percent of VDC buildings across the </p><p>nation.  The GON so far has not rebuilt any.  End note.)  He </p><p>said that about half of the nation\'s nearly 4,000 VDCs have </p><p>not requested the release of their annual budget primarily </p><p>because Maoist restrictions inhibit the development </p><p>activities those funds are meant to support.  Awasthi said he </p><p>finds it difficult to blame VDC Secretaries who do not stay </p><p>at their posts out of fear, observing that families of </p><p>policemen killed by the Maoists receive approximately USD </p><p>10,000 in compensation, while VDC officials\' families receive </p><p>nothing. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>DIALOGUE DELAYED IS DIALOGUE CONTINUED? </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  Despite having held two rounds of talks, neither the </p><p>GON nor the Maoists can point to appreciable gains as a </p><p>result.  According to the ICRC, the GON has released as many </p><p>as 1,300 Maoist detainees since the beginning of the </p><p>ceasefire.  Approximately 600-700 remain in custody.  The GON </p><p>continues to arrest some Maoist suspects, most of whom are </p><p>held on weapons violations, rather than under the </p><p>anti-terrorism measures invoked before the ceasefire. </p><p>Although some prominent Maoist detainees have been released, </p><p>several, including Rabindra Shrestha, whose release </p><p>reportedly was promised during the second round, remain in </p><p>custody (Ref B).  The RNA\'s flat refusal to restrict its </p><p>movements to a 5-km radius around  barracks--after Maoist </p><p>negotiators publicly announced the GON had committed to do so </p><p>during the second round--was another perceived setback to the </p><p>insurgents\' prestige.  The June 4 change in government--and </p><p>thus in the composition of the GON negotiating team--has </p><p>muddied prospects for progress in the peace talks still </p><p>further. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  Some GON sources claim the signal lack of progress </p><p>as a victory.  According to Nischal Nath Pandey of the GON\'s </p><p>Institute of Foreign Affairs, the government has consistently </p><p>employed a strategy of delaying progress and drawing out </p><p>dialogue for as long as possible, reasoning that a </p><p>combination of inclement weather, popular aversion to resumed </p><p>conflict, and overall inertia will keep the Maoists off the </p><p>battle field.  Other sources, including politicians, NGO </p><p>activists, businessmen, and members of the security forces, </p><p>express a similar sang-froid that the Maoists, despite their </p><p>ever-bellicose rhetoric, are not contemplating a return to </p><p>fighting.  According to this rather sanguine analysis, </p><p>tighter Indian control of the border and the perceived threat </p><p>posed by foreign, including US, security assistance have </p><p>forced the Maoist leadership to seek "a soft landing" back </p><p>into the political mainstream. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C)  Brig. Gen. Dilip Rayamajhi, Director of Military </p><p>Intelligence, told poloff that he shares some of this </p><p>optimism.  The Maoists have to continue training and </p><p>"fundraising" to keep their cadres in the field employed, he </p><p>reasoned; their activism need not presage a return to the </p><p>battlefield.  The RNA assesses that the Maoists have lost 50 </p><p>percent of their cadres, he said, basing his analysis on an </p><p>informal estimate that about half of the Maoist cadres who </p><p>have returned home since the ceasefire will be unwilling to </p><p>take up arms again.  (Note:  Given Maoist "recruitment" and </p><p>conscription methods, we question this estimate.  See </p><p>reporting in other channels that may belie his assumptions. </p><p>End note.)  Even though the Maoists are continuing to train, </p><p>their resources are severely limited, he asserted, both </p><p>because of dwindling funds and because of stricter Indian </p><p>border controls.  He pointed to reports that the Maoists had </p><p>begun using wooden bullets while training as evidence of </p><p>their straitened circumstances. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) The ceasefire, despite the higher number of </p><p>casualties and violations than its 2001 predecessor, has </p><p>given this battle-weary nation a welcome respite.  This </p><p>respite should not, however, lull either the GON, the general </p><p>public, or the diplomatic community into a complacency that </p><p>overlooks the Maoists\' obvious activism.  Despite the break </p><p>in hostilities, the Maoists continue to keep large parts of </p><p>the country off limits to the civilian GON, thereby </p><p>undercutting its ability to provide services to disaffected </p><p>segments of the population.  The GON\'s stalling tactics on </p><p>the dialogue front, aggravated by the June 4 change in </p><p>government, may begin to wear thin with the Maoists, who </p><p>likely are anxious to demonstrate some measure of progress </p><p>and success to their presumably restive cadres.  The recent </p><p>uptick in the Maoists\' anti-American rhetoric may reflect </p><p>some of that frustration.  Unfortunately, the new Prime </p><p>Minister\'s protracted deliberations in choosing a Cabinet </p><p>will likely delay dialogue still more, further diminishing </p><p>immediate prospects for a negotatied settlement. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BOGGS </p><p></p></div>
