<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L VATICAN 000057 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR EUR/WE (MENNUTI); AF/S </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/04/2006 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, AN, VT </p><p>SUBJECT: SANT\'EGIDIO/UNITA TALKING PEACE </p><p> </p><p>REF: 01VATICAN 4030 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: CHARGE MERANTE, REASON E.O. 12958 1.5 (B,D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  IN AN ASIDE TO POLOFF BEFORE A 12/20/01 MEETING WITH </p><p>S/E DANFORTH TO DISCUSS SUDAN PEACE INITIATIVES (REPORTED </p><p>SEPTEL), SANT\'EGIDIO SPIRITUAL DIRECTOR AND AFRICA HAND DON </p><p>MATTEO ZUPPI RELATED HIS RECENT CONVERSATIONS WITH UNITA </p><p>LEADER SAVIMBI AND LOCAL UNITA REP.  ZUPPI, A FLUENT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  00057  041304Z </p><p>PORTUGUESE SPEAKER WITH LONG EXPERIENCE IN AFRICA, HAS BEEN </p><p>ACTIVELY PRESSING UNITA CONTACTS TO OFFER A MEANINGFUL </p><p>CEASEFIRE SINCE BEFORE HIS APPEAL FOR USG SUPPORT (REPORTED </p><p>REFTEL) SOME MONTHS AGO.  HE TOLD POLOFF THAT SAVIMBI HAD </p><p>INDICATED TO HIM DURING A PHONE CONVERSATION TWO WEEKS BEFORE </p><p>CHRISTMAS THAT UNITA, AS A CONFIDENCE BUILDING MEASURE, WOULD </p><p>OFFER A UNILATERAL THREE-MONTH CEASEFIRE STARTING AROUND </p><p>CHRISTMAS.  ACCORDING TO ZUPPI, SAVIMBI ONLY NEEDED TO </p><p>CONSULT WITH HIS "GENERALS" BEFORE ANNOUNCING IT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  ZUPPI SAID HE LATER SPOKE WITH THE UNITA </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE IN ROME, WHO TOLD HIM THAT IN A PRE-CHRISTMAS </p><p>TELEVISION INTERVIEW ANGOLAN PRESIDENT CHISSANO HAD MADE </p><p>SCATHING REMARKS ABOUT DRIVING THE UNITA REBELS INTO THE SEA, </p><p>THUS MAKING SAVIMBI\'S OFFER HARDER TO CARRY OUT.  ZUPPI </p><p>SPECULATED THAT BOTH CHISSANO AND SAVIMBI WERE MORE </p><p>"PRIMITIVE" THAN HAD BEEN HIS INTERLOCUTORS IN MOZAMBIQUE, </p><p>AND THAT THEIR RHETORIC FREQUENTLY HAMPERS MOVEMENT TOWARD A </p><p>PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT.  NEVERTHELESS, MATTEO AVERRED, WITH A </p><p>LITTLE PUSH FROM OUTSIDE HE BELIEVED THE ANGOLANS COULD </p><p>DUPLICATE THE MOZAMBIQUE EXPERIENCE (I.E. AN OFF-SITE </p><p>DIALOGUE LEADING TO A PEACE AGREEMENT, MEDIATED BY </p><p>SANT\'EGIDIO). </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  QUERIED ABOUT THE ANGOLAN CATHOLIC BISHOPS\' RECENT </p><p>CALLS FOR A PEACE DIALOGUE, ZUPPI RESPONDED THAT THEY WERE </p><p>WELL MEANING BUT EQUALLY UNSOPHISTICATED, AND WEAK.  HE NOTED </p><p>THAT THEY DIDN\'T HAVE ANYTHING TO OFFER BEYOND THEIR APPEAL; </p><p>WHAT THEY NEEDED WAS AN ACTION PLAN. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  COMMENT:  AFTER REFTEL CONVERSATION, WE WERE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  00057  041304Z </p><p>PLEASANTLY SURPRISED TO HEAR THAT DON MATTEO HAD SPOKEN </p><p>DIRECTLY WITH SAVIMBI ABOUT A UNILATERAL CEASEFIRE.  WE ASKED </p><p>WHETHER THE THREE- MONTH TIMEFRAME MIGHT HAVE BEEN TOO </p><p>AMBITIOUS; ZUPPI APPEARED TO US PATIENT, BUT FIRM IN HIS </p><p>INTENT TO KEEP PROBING SAVIMBI FOR WHAT HE CALLED A </p><p>MEANINGFUL GESTURE.  WE LEAVE IT TO THOSE MORE FULLY </p><p>KNOWLEDGEABLE OF THE POLITICAL DYNAMICS OF THE PARTIES TO </p><p>DECIDE WHETHER THESE CONVERSATIONS POINT TO THE POSSIBILITY </p><p>OF A BREAKTHROUGH -- ALTHOUGH WE HASTEN TO ADD IT HAS BEEN </p><p>MORE THAN A WEEK SINCE CHRISTMAS AND WE HAVE NOT SEEN ANY </p><p>REPORT OF AN ANGOLA CEASEFIRE. </p><p>MERANTE </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> </p><p></p><p> 2002VATICA00057 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
