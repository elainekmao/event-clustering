WFP international staff will soon establish a full-time </p><p>presence in Mosul, with responsibility also for At Tamim and </p><p>Salah ad Din governorates.  WFP, working with the MOT, is </p><p>providing food to hospitals and social institutions in </p><p>Mosul.  WFP/Kirkuk reports that insecurity, salaries, and </p><p>the need for MOT office equipment are the biggest obstacles </p><p>limiting the quick revival of a successful PDS in At Tamim </p><p>governorate.  PUK officials in As Sulaymaniyah have </p><p>expressed concern to WFP about the backlog of distributions </p><p>and the need for retroactive distributions.  Discussion is </p><p>ongoing in the three northern governorates whether it is </p><p>best for WFP to procure the wheat harvest as whole grain or </p><p>wheat flour.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>MOSUL </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p>2.  The U.N. Security Coordinator (UNSECOORD) conducted a </p><p>security assessment on 7 May of Mosul.  U.N. World Food </p><p>Program (WFP) program and logistics staff are now traveling </p><p>daily to Mosul and Kirkuk.  WFP is providing some support to </p><p>Ministry of Trade (MOT) food offices in Mosul and Kirkuk </p><p>(for example, two computers in each location) and minor </p><p>repairs to grain storage structures.  The WFP northern </p><p>deputy responsible for Mosul and Kirkuk has arrived in Arbil </p><p>and will likely move to Mosul this coming week.  She will </p><p>head up the team focusing on Ninawa and At Tamim </p><p>governorates. </p><p> </p><p>3. The DART traveled to Mosul on 5 May and met with WFP </p><p>national staff, who reported that there is no shortage of </p><p>food in the city of Mosul.  WFP also noted that when </p><p>security allows, they will conduct an assessment to look at </p><p>pockets of vulnerability. </p><p> </p><p>4. </p><p>The Ministry of Trade (MOT) in Mosul on 12 May began to </p><p>distribute non-WFP commodities to the 30 percent of the </p><p>population who had not received March distributions (for </p><p>August), which were interrupted by the war.  The MOT in </p><p>Kirkuk will similarly distribute wheat flour to the </p><p>approximately 30 percent there who did not receive the </p><p>August distribution in Ninawa.  While cash is much more </p><p>important right now than food, with the current absence of </p><p>salaries, WFP believes that MOT distributions are </p><p>appropriate.  Food is available in the markets, but at </p><p>approximately double pre-war prices.  WFP and the MOT are </p><p>distributing to hospitals and social institutions because </p><p>there was concern that stocks were running dry. </p><p> </p><p>5.  WFP/Mosul reports that its relationship with Coalition </p><p>Forces has been helpful.  The Coalition has posted 35 </p><p>soldiers to guard the WFP stores every night, and has </p><p>recently provided WFP an additional 15,000 metric ton (MT) </p><p>capacity warehousing complex since WFP\'s own 13,000 MT </p><p>stores are now full.  It contains 13,000 MT of wheat flour, </p><p>together with 640 MT lentils, 91 MT weaning cereal, and 600 </p><p>MT vegetable oil.  The wheat flour is a little less than </p><p>half that necessary for a normal monthly distribution in </p><p>Ninawa.  The second warehouse is being guarded by "local </p><p>security."  The Coalition Forces have also provided some </p><p>fuel to WFP. </p><p> </p><p>6.  WFP national staff believe the public distribution </p><p>system (PDS) has been the best mechanism for distribution - </p><p>in terms of fairness, dignity, organization and timeliness - </p><p>and should certainly be continued instead of setting up a </p><p>new system.  Despite extensive looting of the MOT offices, </p><p>its staff members saved disks with food/flour agent and </p><p>beneficiary data, and the MOT local contract transporter </p><p>(from main warehouses to each food/flour agent) is still </p><p>available.  This information, however, needs to be confirmed </p><p>with the MOT. </p><p> </p><p>------ </p><p>KIRKUK </p><p>------ </p><p> </p><p>7.  The DART traveled to Kirkuk on 8 May and met with WFP </p><p>local staff.  WFP/Kirkuk believes the silos and mills in the </p><p>governorate are generally in good condition, and the Civil </p><p>Military Operation Center (CMOC) personnel believe there is </p><p>approximately 130,000 MT in governorate silos.  A 300,000 MT </p><p>harvest is due in the area next month.  Coalition forces in </p><p>Kirkuk arranged an initial meeting with the MOT heads of </p><p>department on 6 May, an important step in reviving the </p><p>entire MOT structure. </p><p> </p><p>8.  WFP raised concern regarding the shortage of fuel to </p><p>enable farmers to bring their grain to market next month. </p><p>CMOC personnel noted that the Bayji refinery should soon be </p><p>repaired, allowing for sufficient fuel on the market in </p><p>approximately two weeks time. </p><p> </p><p>9.  WFP/Kirkuk raised the following as the greatest </p><p>constraints to quickly reviving the PDS: 1) Security of its </p><p>warehouses, currently guarded by local security;  2) </p><p>Replacement of MOT furniture and equipment that had been </p><p>looted; and 3) Salaries of MOT staff. The nationwide $20 </p><p>emergency payments for each government employee are being </p><p>provided in Kirkuk, but employees remain concerned about </p><p>when they will receive their salaries and how much they will </p><p>be paid. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>AS SULAYMANIYAH </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) government officials </p><p>have expressed concern to WFP about the backlog of </p><p>distributions and the need for retroactive distributions. </p><p>(Note:  While the rest of the country received double </p><p>rations since last fall, the northern three governorates </p><p>received wheat flour in single ration allotments, rather </p><p>than double.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>11.  WFP agrees this could be an extremely sensitive issue, </p><p>given that the north has strongly supported the Coalition. </p><p>At the same time, DART and WFP recognize it does not make </p><p>sense to provide four-month flour rations (May through </p><p>August) to northern populations, especially when the </p><p>northern harvest looks promising. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>MAKHMUR SILO IN ARBIL </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  The DART visited Makhmur silo in Arbil on 15 May.  It </p><p>has a capacity of 100,000 MT in addition to 60,000 to 70,000 </p><p>MT of open storage (similar to large swimming pool-sized </p><p>bins).  The silo has been assessed by WFP and the Office of </p><p>Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance (ORHA), and </p><p>requires some minor repairs to become functional, and larger </p><p>repairs to be fully operational.  The open storage, however, </p><p>is usable immediately.  WFP believes that with minimal input </p><p>(approximately USD 25,000) the silo could handle </p><p>approximately 40,000 MT.  A much larger investment would be </p><p>required to make it fully functioning (approximately USD </p><p>500,000).  The surrounding fields of wheat and barley appear </p><p>very good, and barley has just begun to be harvested. </p><p> </p><p>13.  The DART met with Coalition Forces, based at the silo, </p><p>who are in charge of operations in Makhmur, a traditionally </p><p>Kurdish farming area that had been "Arabized" over the last </p><p>12 years.  In the past few weeks, many Kurds have returned </p><p>to this part of Arbil district (which before the war was </p><p>under GOI administration in Mosul) and have displaced a </p><p>number of the Arab farmers who had settled there. </p><p> </p><p>14.  Coalition forces have been charged with enforcing an </p><p>agreement made some days ago between the Arbil Ministry of </p><p>Agriculture (MOA), Mosul authorities, and Makhmur leaders </p><p>(and facilitated by the Coalition) that the previous Kurdish </p><p>landowners and the Arabs who planted the current crop would </p><p>share the harvest equally. </p><p> </p><p>15.  The Coalition has tasked helicopters to patrol the huge </p><p>farming district and to arrest farmers who are currently </p><p>harvesting barley.  The Coalition forces are also </p><p>confiscating machinery, until the farmer (primarily Kurdish </p><p>now) can prove he owns the land, and agrees to share the </p><p>harvest with any Arab who also has ownership documents.  The </p><p>process requires a visit to the agriculture office, where </p><p>the "harvest authorization" clearance process is conducted. </p><p>It is reportedly straightforward and takes a short time, </p><p>allowing the farmer to quickly return to harvesting. </p><p>16.  Coalition forces hope that this campaign will persuade </p><p>farmers to proactively seek clearance before harvesting. </p><p>While acknowledging that this is a short-term solution, and </p><p>there are a number of issues in the details (who pays for </p><p>the harvesting, how is the 50 percent split effected, etc.), </p><p>the Coalition views this as the best way to stave off </p><p>violence and ensure that the current crop is harvested </p><p>successfully.  Thus far, it appears to be a successful </p><p>campaign, although farmers have only begun to harvest </p><p>barley; the real test will come in early June when the </p><p>substantial wheat crop matures. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>LOCAL PURCHASE </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>17.  Between 1994 and 1995 WFP procured, through CARE, </p><p>approximately 10,000 MT of wheat in the north.  For the much </p><p>larger quantities expected this year, WFP believes that it </p><p>would be much easier to buy wheat flour in the north rather </p><p>than wheat grain, to obviate the need for WFP to conduct pre- </p><p>milling quality checks and undertake the milling itself. </p><p>WFP indicates that its procedures require a tender, rather </p><p>than working directly through the MOA.  WFP is sending a </p><p>procurement officer to the north in the coming days to </p><p>explore the options. </p><p> </p><p>18.  By contrast, PUK ministry officials have suggested to </p><p>WFP/Sulaymaniyah that wheat grain could be distributed </p><p>rather than wheat flour from the harvest in the north.  WFP </p><p>says it has previously had bad experiences with private </p><p>tenders for other goods when attempting to make a local </p><p>purchase (as businessmen tend to pool and inflate rates). </p><p>Consequently, WFP/Sulaymaniyah would prefer that the MOT\'s </p><p>Grain Board procure wheat nationwide.  WFP could then </p><p>purchase from the Grain Board at a fixed rate. </p><p> </p><p>19.  According to WFP/Mosul, there may be some 250,000 MT of </p><p>wheat grain in government silos within Ninawa governorate </p><p>and 130,000 MT wheat in At Tamim governorate.  These amounts </p><p>need to be confirmed.  This wheat is part of the National </p><p>Strategic Reserve and falls under the jurisdiction of the </p><p>MOT.  If the MOT chose to do so, the wheat could be fed into </p><p>the PDS. </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
