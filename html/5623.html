TWO REVOLVE </p><p>AROUND THE ISSUE OF ECONOMIC REFORM CONDITIONALITY (ARTICLE 4 AND </p><p>ARTICLE 7, THIRD TICK).  TWO BRACKETS (THE PREAMBULAR CONDITION </p><p>AND ARTICLE 7, SECOND TICK) NOTE THAT THE TERM "FULL MILITARY </p><p>COOPERATION" NEEDS TO BE DEFINED.  THE LAST TWO BRACKETS (ON THE </p><p>DEFAULT AND PENALTY ARTICLES) WERE REQUESTED BY THE TURKS TO ALLOW </p><p>THEM TO CHECK IF THESE TERMS WERE FULLY CONSISTENT WITH THEIR </p><p>WORLD BANK LOAN DOCUMENTS.  UNDER SECRETARY TAYLOR MADE CLEAR THAT </p><p>THIS WAS AN INFORMAL DOCUMENT FOR DISCUSSION PURPOSES, SUBJECT TO </p><p>FURTHER REVISION, AND THAT FINAL TERMS WOULD BE NEGOTIATED FOR THE </p><p>FORMAL LOAN/GRANT AGREEMENTS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) BEGIN TEXT OF DRAFT TERM SHEET: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>TERM SHEET FOR U.S.- TURKEY GRANT/LOAN FACILITY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>This term sheet outlines the basic structural elements and legal </p><p>and administrative requirements for a grant/loan facility from the </p><p>United States to Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Any economic assistance is predicated upon Turkey\'s completion of </p><p>its fourth review under the IMF Stand By Arrangement, and upon </p><p>Turkey\'s full cooperation [to be defined] with the USG military </p><p>operation in Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GENERAL TERMS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  Form of Assistance </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A. What will be the form of U.S. assistance? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  U.S. assistance includes military assistance from the Foreign </p><p>Military Financing ("FMF") account and economic assistance </p><p>("Economic Assistance") from the Economic Support Fund ("ESF"). </p><p>This term sheet only addresses the Economic Assistance. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  The funds for Economic Assistance will come from a 2003 </p><p>Congressional supplemental appropriation for the Economic Support </p><p>Fund.  The supplemental appropriation will enter into force when </p><p>the Congress passes it and the President signs it. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>B.  How will the Economic Assistance be divided between loans, </p><p>loan guarantees, and/or grants? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Economic Assistance will be provided through a flexible </p><p>package (the "Facility") that can be split between grant(s) and </p><p>funding the USG budget/subsidy cost of a loan(s) and/or loan </p><p>guarantee(s), within the parameters of the Credit Reform Act of </p><p>1990  - the amount of any loan(s) or loan guarantee(s) would </p><p>depend on, for example, the exact terms (e.g., interest rates, </p><p>grace periods, disbursement schedule) of the loan(s) and the </p><p>allocated amount from the Facility. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Turkey would have the right to use part of the appropriations </p><p>to fund the subsidy costs of a loan and/or guarantee, as defined </p><p>in the Credit Reform Act of 1990, and then retain the flexibility, </p><p>at a later date, to use the balance of the appropriations, as long </p><p>as the appropriated funds have not expired under the supplemental </p><p>appropriations law, to fund a grant or, possibly, a loan and/or </p><p>guarantee under different terms.  The total ceiling on loans </p><p>and/or guarantees that would  be made available would be specified </p><p>in the grant/loan agreement. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  To ensure maximum flexibility, the loan/grant agreement would </p><p>have to allow Turkey to adjust the amount and the terms to permit </p><p>the reallocation of unused appropriations for grant(s), loan(s), </p><p>or guarantee(s), as long as the appropriations have not expired </p><p>under the supplemental appropriations law, which would include the </p><p>expiration date, and the loan/guarantee ceiling has not been </p><p>reached. The expiration date will be later than the end of the </p><p>time period for availability of disbursements under the Facility </p><p>as described in Article 7. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  Purposes </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  This Facility will help the Republic of Turkey maintain </p><p>confidence, support the Turkish economy, and contain and offset </p><p>the economic impact of a conflict in Iraq. The Facility should not </p><p>lead to an increase in the overall amount of Turkish debt. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Any agreement under the Facility will indicate how Turkey will </p><p>use loan and grant funds. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  Form and Timing of Disbursements </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Funds would be disbursed over time rather than in one lump- </p><p>sum. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Grant funds would be available over a [X-month] period.  An </p><p>amount up to [X%] of the grant would be available in the first </p><p>disbursement, with the remaining disbursements to be specified. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Credit (whether by direct lending or guarantees of private </p><p>lending) would be available over a [X-month] period.  An amount up </p><p>to [X%] of the nominal ceiling on credit exposure would be </p><p>available in the first disbursement, with the remaining </p><p>disbursements to be specified. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.   Economic Conditions Precedent for Disbursement </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Turkey has committed to strong economic policies.  [Any </p><p>disbursement of funds to Turkey would depend on Turkey\'s </p><p>implementation of these strong economic policies.] </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  [In making decisions about disbursements, Turkey\'s performance </p><p>under programs supported by the international financial </p><p>institutions would be of paramount importance.] </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.     Monitoring and Evaluation </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  The USG will monitor whether Turkey is meeting the conditions </p><p>set forth in the agreement. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Turkey and USG officials will have consultation meetings, as </p><p>needed, on Turkey\'s use of resources under the Facility. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Turkey will provide, at the request of the USG, all </p><p>information provided to the IMF, including information needed to </p><p>track the use of funds under the Facility. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  Disbursement Requests/Reports </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turkey will submit a report before it requests each disbursement, </p><p>which will include information such as debt service payments to </p><p>the international financial institutions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  Termination of Disbursements to Turkey </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  The time period for availability of disbursements under the </p><p>Facility is [X] months.  If Turkey has not drawn the full amount </p><p>available, whether in loans or grants, after [X] months, it would </p><p>not have access to the remaining funds under the Facility. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  If the USG determines that Turkey is not "fully cooperating" </p><p>[to be defined] with the USG on military matters, the USG would </p><p>inform Turkey that it was suspending Turkey\'s right to obtain </p><p>disbursements.  The agreement could allow for a consultation </p><p>period to resolve differences, and if such differences had not </p><p>been resolved in [X] days, Turkey no longer would be able to draw </p><p>funds from the Facility, and the Facility would terminate. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Similarly, if Turkey were to fall off track in its economic </p><p>performance [, as discussed in Article 4 above,] the USG would </p><p>inform Turkey that it was suspending Turkey\'s right to obtain </p><p>disbursements.   The agreement could allow for a consultation </p><p>period to resolve differences, and if such differences had not </p><p>been resolved in [X] days, Turkey no longer would be able to draw </p><p>funds from the Facility, and the Facility would terminate. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LOAN TERMS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In addition, the following terms will need to be finalized for any </p><p>loan agreement: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  Maturity Date </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>For each disbursement, [X] years from the date of disbursement </p><p>with a [X year] grace period on repayments of principal. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  Interest Rate </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The interest rate for all disbursements within a loan would be </p><p>fixed at the time of the first disbursement of that loan. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  Repayments </p><p>Repayments of principal (after the grace period ends) and payments </p><p>of interest (beginning 6 months after the first disbursement is </p><p>made) would be made semiannually. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  Prepayment of Principal </p><p>Turkey could prepay principal without penalty. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  [Default/Acceleration of Repayments </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  The USG, in its sole discretion, could declare (some or) all </p><p>outstanding loan disbursements, together with accrued and unpaid </p><p>interest, to be due and payable if Turkey (a) provides materially </p><p>incorrect representations or warranties, (b) takes actions to </p><p>undermine the objectives of the loan agreement (as determined by </p><p>the USG), (c) fails to comply with covenants such as information- </p><p>sharing (see article 6 above), or (d) is in payment default under </p><p>its IMF or World Bank obligations.] </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13.  [PENALTIES </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  In the event that Turkey fails to meet repayment terms, it </p><p>would lose access to all future USG assistance (e.g. EXIM Bank </p><p>loans, Foreign Assistance Act grants).  To the extent that </p><p>undisbursed funds remain in the Facility, Turkey\'s access to these </p><p>funds would also end. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  In addition, penalty interest at [x] rate would also be </p><p>assessed on overdue and unpaid principal/interest payments.] </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14.  Dispute Settlement </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The GOT and the USG will agree to submit to the jurisdiction of </p><p>the federal courts in the Southern District of New York. The </p><p>agreement will specify that it should be construed in accordance </p><p>with New York law. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15.  Other Legal Provisions </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  The USG will require that the agreement contain negative </p><p>pledge and pari passu clauses to ensure that Turkey does not grant </p><p>any other creditor preferential treatment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  The USG will require legal opinions from Turkish private and </p><p>government counsel that the GOT\'s obligations under the agreement </p><p>are in full accord with Turkish law. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.
