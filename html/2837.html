ALTHOUGH THE POSSIBILITY FOR REAL PEACE HAS FINALLY </p><p>COME TO ANGOLA, THE IMMEDIATE HUMANITARIAN NEEDS ARE </p><p>IMMENSE AND CRITICAL IN THE NEAR TERM.  THE U.N. HAS </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  02065  01 OF 10  291503Z </p><p>IDENTIFIED 36 INACCESSIBLE AREAS THAT MAY CONTAIN </p><p>500,000 PEOPLE IN NEED, IN ADDITION THOUSANDS OF </p><p>VULNERABLE PEOPLE ARE WALKING INTO PROVINCIAL CAPITALS </p><p>SEEKING ASSISTANCE (PROJECTED 20,000-30,000 PER MONTH </p><p>FOR FOUR MONTHS), THE NUMBERS IN THE NUTRITIONAL FEEDING </p><p>CENTERS CONTINUE TO RISE (POSSIBLY RISING TO 25,000- </p><p>30,000 IN FOUR MONTHS\' TIME), REFUGEES WILL BEGIN </p><p>RETURNING HOME, AND THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF </p><p>ANGOLA (GRA) HAS IDENTIFIED 38 QUARTERING AREAS FOR </p><p>UNITA EX-COMBATANTS AND THEIR FAMILIES WHO WILL BE IN </p><p>NEED OF ASSISTANCE (POSSIBLE 355,000).  FOOD IS A </p><p>CRITICAL NEED OF ALL THESE GROUPS.  AT THE CURRENT TIME, </p><p>THE GRA IS SAYING THAT IT WILL PROVIDE FOOD FOR THE </p><p>QUARTERING AREAS.  ALREADY PROVIDING FOOD TO </p><p>APPROXIMATELY ONE MILLION BENEFICIARIES, ENORMOUS </p><p>PRESSURE IS GROWING ON THE U.N. WORLD FOOD PROGRAM (WFP) </p><p>TO SIGNIFICANTLY EXPAND ITS PROGRAM IN ORDER TO PROVIDE </p><p>FOOD FOR THESE ADDITIONAL GROUPS, AND THERE IS CONCERN </p><p>THAT THEIR EFFORTS ARE LAGGING BEHIND.

AT </p><p>THE SAME TIME, THE DONORS AND THE U.N. MUST KEEP </p><p>UNRELENTING PRESSURE ON THE GRA TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY </p><p>FOR THE NEEDS OF ITS POPULATION.  SEVERAL </p><p>RECOMMENDATIONS WERE GIVEN TO WFP\'S PROGRAMMATIC SECTION </p><p>IN AN EFFORT TO MORE ACCURATELY TARGET BENEFICIARIES AND </p><p>ACCOUNT FOR ITS COMMODITIES.

IN PARALLEL WITH THIS EFFORT, THE HUMANITARIAN </p><p>COMMUNITY IS ATTEMPTING TO MEET THE GROWING HUMANITARIAN </p><p>NEEDS IN THE COUNTRY.  HUNDREDS, AND IN SOME CASES </p><p>THOUSANDS, OF PEOPLE ARE WALKING INTO PROVINCIAL </p><p>CAPITALS FROM THE BUSH IN SEARCH OF ASSISTANCE.

SOME DON\'T EVEN HAVE CLOTHES. </p><p>OTHERS ARE SO WEAK THEY ARE BEING AIRLIFTED IN </p><p>HELICOPTERS OR BEING TRANSPORTED IN TRUCKS BY THE ARMED </p><p>FORCES OF ANGOLA (FAA).

IN LUENA </p><p>(MOXICO PROVINCE), 7,000 TO 8,000 PERSONS HAVE BEEN </p><p>ARRIVING EACH MONTH SINCE LAST DECEMBER.  WFP EXPECTS </p><p>11,000 NEW INTERNALLY DISPLACED PERSONS (IDPS) IN BIE </p><p>PROVINCE IN THE MONTH OF MAY.  LARGE NUMBERS OF </p><p>BENEFICIARIES ALSO EXIST IN HUAMBO, MALANGE, AND HUILA </p><p>PROVINCES.

THE AREAS HAVE BEEN </p><p>INACCESSIBLE BECAUSE OF INSECURITY, SOMETIMES COUPLED </p><p>WITH LACK OF PHYSICAL ACCESS DUE TO DESTROYED </p><p>INFRASTRUCTURE, SUCH AS BRIDGES.  THE U.N. OFFICE FOR </p><p>THE COORDINATION OF HUMANITARIAN AFFAIRS (OCHA) HAS BEEN </p><p>COLLECTING INFORMATION ON THESE AREAS FOR MORE THAN A </p><p>YEAR.

ON HER FIRST DAY IN LUANDA, THE SEC RECEIVED A WFP </p><p>PIPELINE REPORT THAT ANTICIPATED NO INCREASE IN </p><p>BENEFICIARY LEVELS IN THE COMING MONTHS.  BY THE END OF </p><p>THE WEEK, WFP HAD CONDUCTED A PLANNING EXERCISE THAT </p><p>REFLECTED A POSSIBLE INCREASE OF 140,000 NEW </p><p>BENEFICIARIES IN MAY, RISING STEADILY TO A POSSIBLE </p><p>650,000 BY SEPTEMBER (THIS CASELOAD WOULD BE IN ADDITION </p><p>TO THE NUMBERS IN THE NEW PRRO).  SUCH A FIGURE </p><p>ANTICIPATES A SHORT-TERM INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF </p><p>SPONTANEOUS ARRIVALS IN THE PROVINCIAL CAPITALS, </p><p>REACHING THE VULNERABLE PEOPLE LOCATED IN THE 36 IAS, A </p><p>NEAR-TERM INCREASE IN THE NEED FOR NUTRITIONAL PROGRAMS, </p><p>REFUGEES RETURNING HOME, AND PROVIDING FOOD FOR UNITA </p><p>FAMILIES IN 32 OF THE 38 QUARTERING AREAS.  IN APRIL, </p><p>WFP PLANS TO PROVIDE FOOD TO APPROXIMATELY 961,000 </p><p>PERSONS, 95 PERCENT OF WHICH IS EITHER FOR EMERGENCY </p><p>GENERAL DISTRIBUTIONS OR NUTRITIONAL FEEDING PROGRAMS. </p><p>IT IS CONCEIVABLE THAT WFP\'S CASELOAD COULD REACH 1.7 </p><p>MILLION BY LATE SUMMER.  WITH THE MAJOR PLANTING SEASON </p><p>IN SEPTEMBER/OCTOBER, IT IS VERY LIKELY THERE WILL BE </p><p>SIGNIFICANT FOOD NEEDS IN ANGOLA UNTIL THE HARVEST THIS </p><p>TIME NEXT YEAR. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>WFP\'S NEW PROTRACTED RELIEF AND RECOVERY OPERATION </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  02065  04 OF 10  291504Z </p><p>15.  OVER THE LAST FIVE MONTHS, WFP/ANGOLA HAS BEEN </p><p>PREPARING ITS NEXT PRRO.  THE CURRENT PRRO, WHICH BEGAN </p><p>APRIL 1, 2001, ENDS ON JUNE 30, 2002.  THE NEW PRRO </p><p>BEGINS JULY 1, 2002 AND IS DESIGNED TO MEET THE </p><p>EMERGENCY AND RECOVERY NEEDS OF APPROXIMATELY 1.16 </p><p>MILLION BENEFICIARIES PER MONTH OVER A PERIOD OF 18 </p><p>MONTHS.  IN IN-COUNTRY DISCUSSIONS, THE SEC RECOMMENDED </p><p>TO WFP THAT IT AMEND THE NEW PRRO DOCUMENT TO REFLECT </p><p>THE CURRENT SITUATION, SINCE THE CASELOAD UNDER THE </p><p>CURRENT PRRO IS ONE MILLION.  THE NEW PRRO PROVIDES WFP </p><p>THE FLEXIBILITY TO PROGRAMMATICALLY RESPOND TO THE NEW </p><p>SITUATION, BUT NEITHER THE NARRATIVE, NOR THE BUDGET OR </p><p>PIPELINE ADDRESS THE CHANGES ON THE GROUND.

THE SEC ENCOUNTERED SEVERE RESISTANCE FROM </p><p>WFP/ANGOLA, AS WELL AS FROM WFP/HQ, REGARDING THE NOTION </p><p>OF RE-WRITING THE DOCUMENT.  WFP FELT THE PROCESS WAS </p><p>TOO FAR ALONG TO PULL IT BACK FOR RE-WRITES.  WFP/ANGOLA </p><p>WILL THEREFORE PROVIDE AN ADDENDUM AT THE EB, DESCRIBING </p><p>THE CURRENT SITUATION IN ANGOLA.  IT IS HIGHLY LIKELY </p><p>THAT THE NEW PRRO, WHICH SPANS 18 MONTHS, WILL HAVE TO </p><p>BE COMPRESSED TO 12-14 MONTHS TO ACCOMMODATE THE HIGHER </p><p>BENEFICIARY FIGURES AND TONNAGE REQUIREMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>18.

EVEN THOUGH THERE ARE SEVERE </p><p>EMERGENCY NEEDS RIGHT NOW, WFP HAS BEEN FORCED OVER THE </p><p>LAST YEAR TO FOCUS A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF ITS EFFORTS ON </p><p>EMERGENCY ACTIVITIES.  THE BENEFICIARY NUMBERS WILL RISE </p><p>IN THE SHORT TERM, BUT THE TYPES OF PROGRAMS WILL BE </p><p>VERY SIMILAR TO ITS CURRENT EMERGENCY ACTIVITIES.  AS </p><p>THE COUNTRY, AT LAST, MAY BE ABLE TO MOVE TOWARDS A REAL </p><p>RECOVERY PERIOD, THE PRRO PROVIDES THE MECHANISM TO </p><p>ACHIEVE THIS.  AND AS STATED ABOVE, THE NEW PRRO </p><p>PROVIDES THE FLEXIBILITY TO CONDUCT EMERGENCY AND </p><p>RECOVERY PROGRAMS SIMULTANEOUSLY. </p><p> </p><p>19. NOTE: WFP\'S ON GOING PRRO (WHICH ENDS ON JUNE 30, </p><p>2002), COVERS 1.04 MILLION BENEFICIARIES WITH A 228,782 </p><p>METRIC TON PROGRAM, AND IS VALUED AT USD 167.7 MILLION. </p><p>THE PROPOSED DRAFT PRRO WOULD INCREASE THE BENEFICIARY </p><p>COVERAGE LEVEL TO 1.16 MILLION (A TEN PERCENT INCREASE), </p><p>(305,598 METRIC TONS), AT A COST OF USD 233.5 MILLION. </p><p>EXPANDING WFP\'S BENEFICIARY COVERAGE TO 1.7 MILLION </p><p>WOULD FURTHER SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE BOTH TONNAGE AND </p><p>COST LEVELS FOR THE ANGOLA OPERATION.

THE SEC TRIED TO IMPRESS UPON THE WFP COUNTRY </p><p>DIRECTOR (CD) THE NEED TO NOW/NOW RING THE ALARM BELLS </p><p>ABOUT THE IMMINENT BREAKS IN THE PIPELINE.

AT THE SAME TIME, THE SEC URGED WFP/ANGOLA TO BE </p><p>UNYIELDING IN PURSUING ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FROM THE GRA </p><p>AND IN ENCOURAGING THEM TO TAKE ON THEIR SHARE OF THE </p><p>BURDEN.

NOTE:  IN LUENA, THE GOVERNOR TOLD THE SEC THAT HE </p><p>HAD SUBMITTED A BUDGET TO THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT </p><p>REQUESTING 70 MILLION USD FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS FOR </p><p>MOXICO PROVINCE.  HE WAS AWAITING WORD FROM LUANDA.  ONE </p><p>OF HIS FIRST PRIORITIES IS TO REPAIR KEY BRIDGES IN THE </p><p>PROVINCE.
