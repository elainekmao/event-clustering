<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KUWAIT 003101 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/12/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KU </p><p>SUBJECT: AMIR APPOINTS SHEIKH SABAH AS PRIME MINISTER </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Richard H. Jones for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary:  On July 13, the Amir issued a decree </p><p>formally naming Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmed al-Sabah Prime Minister </p><p>of Kuwait.  This ended a behind-the-scenes row between the </p><p>two leading branches of the Kuwaiti ruling al-Sabah family </p><p>over the job, a position traditionally reserved for the Crown </p><p>Prince.  The disagreement over the Prime Minister post had </p><p>dragged on for several days, causing some local observers to </p><p>worry that it might delay the July 19 inaugural session of </p><p>the newly elected National Assembly.  The appointment of </p><p>Sheikh Sabah, which had been widely expected before the </p><p>delay, paves the way for the formation of a new cabinet. </p><p>However, it may also have opened the door to future </p><p>squabbling between the Salim and Jabir lines of the al-Sabah </p><p>family over the future of the Crown Prince.  The current </p><p>Crown Prince, Sheikh Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah, is mentally </p><p>and physically incapable of fulfilling his duties, and many </p><p>believe he should step down.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) After days of rampant speculation, the Amir appointed </p><p>Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmed al-Sabah Prime Minister on July 13, the </p><p>first time the position has ever been entrusted to someone </p><p>other than the Crown Prince.  The decision by the Amir came </p><p>after a tumultuous episode in which the leading Jabir and </p><p>Salim branches of the ruling Sabah family engaged in a </p><p>struggle behind the scenes for control of the office of Prime </p><p>Minister, and possibly, future control of the office of Crown </p><p>Prince. </p><p> </p><p>"GO BACK TO YOUR CAMELS" </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) On July 12, a noted Kuwaiti cultural contact who is a </p><p>close friend with a grandson of First Deputy Prime Minister </p><p>(and acting head of government) Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmed told </p><p>acting DCM of a dramatic showdown in Kuwait\'s ruling family </p><p>over the issue of whether the Amir would issue an expected </p><p>decree transferring the office of prime minister from the </p><p>ailing Crown Prince to Sheikh Sabah.  According to this </p><p>contact, Sheikh Sabah\'s grandson told him that the al-Salim </p><p>branch of the family was strongly resisting the proposed </p><p>transfer of the premiership to Sheikh Sabah, who like the </p><p>Amir comes from the al-Jaber branch of the ruling al Sabah </p><p>family.  Directed by the Amir to work out the issue with the </p><p>al-Salim\'s, Sheikh Sabah met on July 10 with Sheikh Salem </p><p>al-Ali, the head of the Kuwaiti National Guard and the senior </p><p>member of the al-Salim branch, to discuss moving the </p><p>premiership from the Crown Prince to Sheikh Sabah. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The meeting, according to our contact, did not go </p><p>well.  Sheikh Salim is alleged to have told Sheikh Sabah that </p><p>the latter should talk to the Crown Prince about whether he </p><p>would agree to surrender the premiership, to which Sheikh </p><p>Sabah replied that he had already received three different </p><p>answers from the Crown Prince on the subject: that the CP </p><p>would agree with transferring the premiership to Sheikh </p><p>Sabah; that the CP would agree provided that his own son, </p><p>Sheikh Fahd, became deputy prime minister; and that the CP </p><p>would not agree to transfer the position at all.  (NOTE: Our </p><p>contact said that the grandson described the Crown Prince as </p><p>weaving in and out of lucidity in his conversations, often </p><p>engaging an interlocutor with apparently full comprehension </p><p>before lapsing into a confused state and asking "Who are </p><p>you?" and "Whose house is this?" END NOTE)  Sheikh Sabah then </p><p>asked Sheikh Salim if he would support his bid to become PM, </p><p>and the latter refused.  Sheikh Sabah is then said to have </p><p>asked Sheikh Salem if he understood the constitution of </p><p>Kuwait, and when Sheikh Salim said that he did not, Sheikh </p><p>Sabah told him "then go back to your camels" before storming </p><p>out of the meeting. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Our contact said that the al-Salim family members then </p><p>offered a compromise to Sheikh Sabah, wherein he would become </p><p>prime minister but the al-Salim would appoint his cabinet. </p><p>Sheikh Sabah is alleged to have refused this offer and to </p><p>have announced that if he was not made prime minister within </p><p>the week, he would resign his position and leave the country. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) According to our contact, negotiations then ensued </p><p>within the family to find a solution that would accord Sheikh </p><p>Sabah the premiership with full prerogatives while reassuring </p><p>the al-Salim that they are not being cut out of power. </p><p>Evidently, these negotiations have now succeeded, but the </p><p>exact nature of any deals struck remains to be seen. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Comment: Kuwaiti Arabic dailies had been predicting </p><p>for days that an Amiri decree separating the office of prime </p><p>minister from that of Crown Prince and transferring it to </p><p>Sheikh Sabah was imminent.  However, that the al-Salim\'s </p><p>should inveigh against the proposed separation of the </p><p>premiership from their ailing kinsman should not be a </p><p>surprise to anyone familiar with Kuwait\'s idiosyncratic </p><p>tradition of dynastic succession, in which two branches of </p><p>the same family have alternated as Amir and Crown Prince </p><p>since the death of Mubarak the Great in 1915.  To the </p><p>al-Salim--already overmatched by the more numerous and better </p><p>positioned al-Jaber progeny--any abridgement of the Crown </p><p>Prince\'s long-standing prerogatives could be interpreted as a </p><p>step on the way to the ultimate removal of the Crown Prince </p><p>himself.  If protocol can be used as a guide, it appears that </p><p>al-Salim fears may in fact be realized; the Ministry of </p><p>Foreign Affairs has instructed post that Shaykh Sabah should </p><p>now be addressed as His Highness.  Further evidence will be </p><p>provided by the cabinet appointments which should be </p><p>announced within the nwxt 48 to 72 hours.  The fate of such </p><p>Sheikh Saad stalwarts as Minister of Interior Mohammed Khaled </p><p>al-Sabah in the new government will be instructive. </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
