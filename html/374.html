<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KUWAIT 04267 </p><p> </p><p>ALSO FOR POLAD </p><p>LONDON FOR MILLIKAN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, PGOV, KU, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT:  KUWAITIS CALM, CONFIDENT, AND UNIFIED (FOR THE </p><p>          MOMENT) IN THE FACE OF IRAQI THREATS </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  SUMMARY.  FOLLOWING MUBARAK\'S MEDIATION BLITZ </p><p>THROUGH BAGHDAD, KUWAIT, AND JEDDAH JULY 24, THE KUWAITI </p><p>PUBLIC IS CALM AND CONFIDENT THAT TENSION BETWEEN KUWAIT </p><p>AND IRAQ WILL EASE OFF.  SOURCES INDICATE THAT KUWAITIS, </p><p>WHILE CONCERNED ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF ARMED CONFLICT, </p><p>HAVE TAKEN SADDAM\'S BLUSTER IN STRIDE AND ARE HOPEFUL </p><p>THAT MEDIATION EFFORTS WILL PRODUCE A SETTLEMENT, IF </p><p>ONLY TEMPORARY, TO THE IMMEDIATE CRISIS.  KUWAIT\'S </p><p>CABINET REFLECTED THIS MOOD IN A CAREFULLY WORDED </p><p>STATEMENT JULY 22 CALLING FOR A PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT OF </p><p>THE CRISIS WITHIN AN ARAB FRAMEWORK.  EVEN THOSE </p><p>KUWAITIS WHO HAVE EXPRESSED OPPOSITION TO THE GOK\'S </p><p>RECENT POLITICAL TACTICS CONTINUE LINING UP TO EXPRESS </p><p>SUPPORT FOR THE LEADERSHIP.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  IN CONVERSATION WITH EMBOFFS JULY 24, A </p><p>WELL-INFORMED AL-SABAH SOURCE ASSERTED THAT ALL HOPES </p><p>FOR AVERTING ARMED CONFLICT NOW REST ON MUBARAK.  (NOTE: </p><p>CONVERSATION WAS HELD BEFORE THE JULY 25 ANNOUNCEMENT </p><p>THAT KUWAIT-IRAQ TALKS WOULD BEGIN SOON IN JEDDAH.) </p><p>WHEN ASKED IF HE FELT SADDAM MIGHT RESORT TO FORCE, THE </p><p>SOURCE SAID MOST KUWAITIS, HIMSELF INCLUDED, THOUGHT IT </p><p>HIGHLY POSSIBLE.  THE FUROR OVER OIL POLICY WAS CLEARLY </p><p>ONLY A PRETEXT FOR SADDAM TO TAKE WHAT HE HAS ALWAYS </p><p>WANTED - WARBA AND BUBIYAN ISLANDS AND, PERHAPS, THE </p><p>RUMAILAH OIL FIELDS ON THE KUWAITI SIDE OF THE BORDER. </p><p>ONLY FAST DIPLOMATIC ACTION WOULD SAVE THE DAY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  THE SOURCE EXPRESSED CONFIDENCE THAT SHAIKH </p><p>SABAH, THE FOREIGN MINISTER, WOULD BE ABLE TO PULL THIS </p><p>OFF THROUGH THE EGYPTIANS, THE SAUDIS, AND OTHERS.  HE </p><p>CLAIMED THAT THE IRAQI PRESS HAD LAUNCHED PERSONAL </p><p>ATTACKS ON SABAH, BECAUSE "SADDAM KNOWS HE HAS THE </p><p>CAPABILITY TO CHECK HIS EVERY MOVE.  IF ANYTHING, THOSE </p><p>ATTACKS ARE AN INDIRECT COMPLIMENT TO SHAIKH SABAH\'S </p><p>ABILITIES."  SADDAM\'S BLATANT ATTEMPT AT TRYING TO </p><p>DIVIDE THE AL-SABAH FAMILY AND TO PIT THE KUWAITI </p><p>POLITICAL OPPOSITION AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT WERE </p><p>"LAUGHABLE."  WHEREAS SHAIKH SABAH AND THE AMIR ARE </p><p>INTELLIGENT AND HAVE REMAINED COOL THROUGHOUT THE </p><p>CRISIS, SADDAM HAS NOT.  HE ONLY KNOWS ONE LANGUAGE, THE </p><p>LANGUAGE OF FORCE.  THE PROBLEM IS HE THINKS HE CAN GET </p><p>AWAY WITH USING IT. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  CITING THE VISIT OF IRAQI INTERIOR MINISTER </p><p>SAMIR ABDULWAHHAB TO BAHRAIN AND QATAR JULY 24, THE </p><p>SOURCE SAID HE EXPECTED FURTHER IRAQI "ULTIMATUMS" TO </p><p>KUWAIT TO BE DELIVERED THROUGH OTHER GULF STATES. </p><p>THOUGH IRAQI PRESSURE IS CONTINUING, HE ASSERTED THAT </p><p>MOST KUWAITIS, INCLUDING HIMSELF, ARE REMAINING </p><p>CONCERNED YET CALM.  OLDER KUWAITIS REMEMBER THAT KUWAIT </p><p>WEATHERED QASIM\'S RANTINGS OVER THE BORDER IN 1961-63; </p><p>YOUNGER KUWAITIS HAVE PLACED THEIR CONFIDENCE IN THE </p><p>AMIR AND SHAIKH SABAH; AND EVERYONE HAS "AN ALMOST </p><p>RELIGIOUS CONVICTION" THAT SADDAM\'S DAYS ARE NUMBERED. </p><p>THE GENERAL FEELING, HE SAID, IS THAT "KUWAIT WILL BE </p><p>HERE TOMORROW, SADDAM MIGHT NOT." </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  KUWAIT UNIVERSITY POLITICAL SCIENCE PROFESSOR </p><p>DR. ABDULLAH AL-SHAYJI, A FORMER POLICY ADVISOR TO THE </p><p>KUWAITI DEFENSE MINISTRY, TOLD EMBOFFS JULY 25 THAT </p><p>KUWAITIS ARE GENERALLY CONFIDENT THAT THIS CRISIS WILL </p><p>PASS.  THE TALK IN THE DIWANIYAS IS THAT KUWAIT WILL </p><p>LIKELY GIVE SADDAM SOME OF THE CASH HE WANTS, AS WELL AS </p><p>PROMISES ON OIL POLICY, BUT NOT AN INCH ON THE BORDER. </p><p>AL-SHAYJI ASSERTED THIS WOULD PLACATE SADDAM, FOR NOW. </p><p>ASKED IF GIVING INTO THE IRAQIS ON MONEY DEMANDS WOULD </p><p>PUT KUWAIT ON A "SLIPPERY SLOPE" OF TENSIONS WITH IRAQ, </p><p>AL-SHAYJI SMILED AND SAID "IT\'S TOO LATE, WE\'VE BEEN </p><p>SLIDING FOR YEARS NOW.  KUWAIT\'S A SMALL COUNTRY.  WE </p><p>HAVE TO ACCEPT BEING PUSHED AROUND A LITTLE, ESPECIALLY </p><p>IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD." </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  AL-SHAYJI NOTED THAT SADDAM\'S EFFORTS TO </p><p>MANIPULATE THE POLITICAL OPPOSITION IN KUWAIT WERE A </p><p>THROWBACK TO 1938, WHEN IRAQ PRESSURED AMIR AHMED </p><p>AL-JABER, THE PRESENT AMIR\'S FATHER, TO ACCEPT A </p><p>PRO-ARAB-NATIONALIST ELECTED COUNCIL.  THE 1938 COUNCIL </p><p>LASTED A FEW MONTHS BUT SADDAM\'S ATTEMPTS HAD NOT EVEN </p><p>GOTTEN OFF THE GROUND.  ACCORDING TO AL-SHAYJI, A GROUP </p><p>OF KUWAITI LEFTISTS HAD REFUSED AN INVITATION EARLIER IN </p><p>THE WEEK TO FLY TO BAGHDAD AND PUBLICLY MEET WITH </p><p>SADDAM.  "THEY\'RE NOT THAT STUPID," AL-SHAYJI ADDED. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  THE CALM MOOD IN THE COUNTRY WAS REFLECTED IN </p><p>THE KUWAITI CABINET\'S JULY 22 STATEMENT, WHICH EXPRESSED </p><p>SATISFACTION WITH THE POSITION OF OTHER ARAB COUNTRIES </p><p>ON THE DISPUTE AND WITH THE LEADERSHIP\'S EFFORTS TO </p><p>CONTAIN IT THROUGH MEDIATION EFFORTS WITHIN "THE ARAB </p><p>HOUSE." </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U)  NUMEROUS KUWAITI SOCIETIES AND ORGANIZATIONS </p><p>HAVE PAID PERSONAL CALLS ON OR WRITTEN LETTERS TO THE </p><p>LEADERSHIP EXPRESSING FULL SUPPORT FOR THE GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>EFFORTS TO RESOLVE THE DISPUTE.  MOST NOTABLY, KUWAIT\'S </p><p>CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY JULY 24 ISSUED A </p><p>STATEMENT, SIGNED BY CCI CHAIRMAN ABDULAZIZ AL-SAGER, </p><p>CALLING FOR CONTAINMENT OF THE KUWAIT-IRAQ DISPUTE </p><p>THROUGH NEGOTIATION AND AVOIDING INCLUSION OF "FOREIGN </p><p>CIRCLES" (I.E., NON-ARABS) IN SETTLING THE DISPUTE.  THE </p><p>STATEMENT EMPHASIZED THAT "THE KUWAITI PEOPLE FULLY </p><p>STAND BEHIND THEIR AMIR AND THE CROWN PRINCE, ESPECIALLY </p><p>WHEN THE SOVEREIGNTY OF KUWAIT IS IN QUESTION." </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  COMMENT.  WHILE THE FOCUS OF DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS </p><p>SHIFTS TO JEDDAH, KUWAITIS CONTINUE TO EXPRESS THEIR </p><p>CONFIDENCE IN AND SUPPORT OF THE GOVERNMENT.  THE </p><p>CHAMBER OF COMMERCE STATEMENT IS ESPECIALLY HELPFUL TO </p><p>THE LEADERSHIP AT THIS TIME BECAUSE IT IS SIGNED BY </p><p>AL-SAGER, THE WELL-RESPECTED DE FACTO HEAD OF THE </p><p>POWERFUL SUNNI MERCHANT COMMUNITY.  AFTER LEADING A </p><p>MERCHANT FAMILY BOYCOTT OF THE NATIONAL COUNCIL </p><p>ELECTIONS IN JUNE, AL-SAGER\'S LETTER OF SUPPORT IS </p><p>PERHAPS THE BEST EXAMPLE YET OF HOW SADDAM\'S VITRIOL HAS </p><p>BEEN RECEIVED HERE.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HOWELL </p><p></p></div>
