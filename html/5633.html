<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 SANAA 000263 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/09/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, KDEM, KISL, YM, DEMOCRATIC REFORM, DOMESTIC POLITICS </p><p>SUBJECT: ROYG INITIATIVE TO ESTABLISH A CODE OF CONDUCT TO </p><p>AVOID VIOLENCE IN THE RUN-UP TO THE APRIL ELECTIONS </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Acting Pol/Econ Chief Catherine J. Westley.  Reason: 1.5 </p><p> (b,d) </p><p> </p><p> 1.  (C)  Summary:  President Saleh this week proposed an </p><p>initiative between the political parties to establish a Code </p><p>of Conduct to ensure peaceful and fair elections.  In a </p><p>controversial move, Saleh appointed Sheikh Zindani, leader of </p><p>the extremist wing of the Islah party, to the multi-party </p><p>committee that would oversee implementation of the Code.  If </p><p>effective, the Code of Conduct could help alleviate possible </p><p>campaign violence.  However, the reaction of the Islah party </p><p>to Zindani\'s appointment as sole Islah representative could </p><p>presage further discord among the parties.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  President Saleh and Vice President Abdo Rabo Manssor </p><p>met with the heads of political parties on February 2 to </p><p>discuss a number of issues related to President Saleh\'s call </p><p>to establish a national Code of Conduct to achieve a "high </p><p>democratic ranking" and protect democracy from violence in </p><p>the run-up to the April parliamentary elections.  According </p><p>to al-Thawra, the official ROYG daily, the basic principles </p><p>of the "national ranking document" which came from President </p><p>Saleh\'s letter to the political parties were as follows: </p><p> </p><p>-- commitment to "national continuities," foremost the </p><p>constitution and laws; </p><p> </p><p>-- maintenance of the democratic trend and embodying the </p><p>principle of peaceful transfer of power; </p><p> </p><p>-- adherence to the rules and ethics of peaceful democratic </p><p>practices and avoiding all forms of violence; </p><p> </p><p>-- keenness for making the unity, independence and </p><p>sovereignty of the homeland the common denominator between </p><p>the government and the opposition. </p><p> </p><p>3,  (U)  The political parties have publicly expressed </p><p>appreciation for the initiative.  The meeting approved the </p><p>formation of a committee.  The independent newspaper al-Ayyam </p><p>on February 3 reported that the committee is headed by </p><p>Presidential Advisor Dr. Abdel Karim al-Iryani and includes </p><p>GPC Political Director Dr. Mohamed Qubati, Islah Shura </p><p>Council Chairman Sheikh Zindani, YSP Assistant Secretary </p><p>General Dr. Saif Sael, Nasserite Unionist Party Secretary </p><p>General Abdul-Malik al-Makhlafy and Deputy Speaker of </p><p>Parliament and Arab Baath Party Secretary General Dr. </p><p>Abdul-Wahab Mahmoud. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  The selection of Sheikh Zindani as representative of </p><p>the Islah party has generated controversy, as he is the </p><p>well-known leader of the more extremist Salafi wing of Islah. </p><p> According to Islah party contacts as reported by NDI, the </p><p>Islah party did not want Zindani as its representative and </p><p>had asked for its Assistant Secretary General Abdul-Wahab </p><p>al-Ansi to be its representative.  President Saleh insisted </p><p>on Zindani\'s participation, and according to contacts chose </p><p>the entire committee personally.  Dr. Iryani told the </p><p>Ambassador February 4 that Zindani had been reluctant to be </p><p>part of the committee, but had earlier approached the </p><p>President about how to avoid violence in the election </p><p>campaign so Saleh insisted.  Moderate Islah party contacts </p><p>believe that Zindani\'s appointment is a power move by Saleh </p><p>to either 1)  create a split between the moderate and </p><p>extremist wings of Islah to hurt its chances in the election, </p><p>2)  highlight the party\'s more extreme elements to discredit </p><p>the party in regards to the public and the West and United </p><p>States or 3)  create problems between the opposition parties </p><p>that are part of the Joint Meeting Parties (JMP) by his </p><p>presence, causing a split that weakens the opposition. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  This Code of Conduct (Arabic:  "mithaq al-sharaf," </p><p>also translated as Code or Compact of Honor) has preempted </p><p>ongoing efforts by international organizations, particularly </p><p>IFES, to establish a written Code of Conduct for the </p><p>elections to prevent violence and promote free and fair </p><p>campaigns.  In November after weeks of negotiations between </p><p>the parties and IFES, an agreement to sign a Code of Conduct </p><p>fell apart after the Islah party pulled out.  The Islah party </p><p>was responding to a new implementing regulation issued by the </p><p>Supreme Committee on Elections and Referenda (SCER) in early </p><p>November that allowed the military to register to vote in </p><p>places other than the location of their barracks.  Because of </p><p>Islah party belief in and fear of military influence in the </p><p>elections in favor of the ruling GPC, Islah pulled out of the </p><p>Code signing in protest.  Dr. Iryani has a copy of this draft </p><p>Code of Conduct for use in the new committee. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  Comment:  President Saleh\'s initiative to form a </p><p>national committee to establish a Code of Conduct to </p><p>alleviate violence is a welcome one, particularly if formal </p><p>mechanisms for dispute resolution are also established. </p><p>However, the appointment of Zindani is at best problematic. </p><p>His presence could make committee consensus harder to </p><p>achieve, and could even provide a pretext for heavy-handed </p><p>tactics by the ROYG to ensure its victory in the April </p><p>elections.  End Summary. </p><p>MISENHEIMER </p><p></p></div>
