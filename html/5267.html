<p>UNCLAS COLOMBO 000122 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>TERREP </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>FOR DS/IP/SA, DS/ICI/PII, DS/DSS/ITA AND SA/INS </p><p> </p><p>E.0. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PTER, ASEC, CE, MIssion Security </p><p>SUBJECT: ANONYMOUS THREAT LETTER </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but unclassified - protect accordingly. </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Colombo British High Commission (BHC) counterpart </p><p>contacted RSO yesterday to report receipt of an anonymous </p><p>threat letter addressed to Americans and British in Sri </p><p>Lanka.  Presumably, letters were sent to both the BHC and </p><p>the Embassy, but we have not yet received our letter.  The </p><p>BHC has already forwarded their letter to the Sri Lanka </p><p>Police for investigation. </p><p> </p><p>BEGIN TEXT - </p><p> </p><p>WARNING TO THE AMERICANS AND THE BRITISH LIVING IN SRI </p><p>LANKA. </p><p> </p><p>WE MUSLIMS IN SRI LANKA CONDEMN THE THREAT OF ATTACKING </p><p>IRAQ.  THE DAY YOU INVADE IRAQ WE WILL KIDNAP THE AMERICANS </p><p>AND BRITISH FAMILIES LIVING IN SRI LANKA. </p><p> </p><p>LIKE PREVIOUSLY WE WILL NOT PROTEST BUT WE WILL DO ALL WHAT </p><p>AL-QAEDA AND OSAMA BIN LADEN WILL ORDER US TO DO. </p><p> </p><p>WE ARE FOLLOWING AL-QAEDA AND OSAMA BIN LADEN.  WE WILL NOT </p><p>KEEP ANY ROOM FOR THE BRITISH/AMERICAN FORCES TO ATTACK OR </p><p>STRIKE OR INVADE IRAQ, AT ANY COST. </p><p> </p><p>WE ARE BOLD TO SAY OUR MUSLIM POLITICAL PARTIES ARE ALLIED </p><p>OR JOINTLY WORKING WITH AL-QAEDA ORGANIZATION LED BY OSAMA </p><p>BIN LADEN. </p><p> </p><p>ONCE WE GET OUR SEPARATE STATE AND A MUSLIM PORT IN SRI </p><p>LANKA WE WILL DO THE NEEDFUL. </p><p> </p><p>END TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Whereas we take all threats seriously, we also see </p><p>an endless number of Sri Lankan-based anonymous poison pen </p><p>letters. We generally view these with a good deal of </p><p>skepticism.  We are reporting this one however, because it </p><p>threatens kidnapping family members.  We continue to believe </p><p>the threat is minimal.  We will nonetheless continue to </p><p>monitor related additional developments and threats closely. </p><p> </p><p>Amselem </p><p></p></div>
