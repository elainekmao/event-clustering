<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L BEIRUT 02659 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL:  OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, PREL, LE </p><p>SUBJECT:  INTENSE FIGHTING ALONG BEIRUT\'S GREEN LINE </p><p> </p><p>1.  C-ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  THE NIGHT OF MAY 6-7 WITNESSED SOME OF THE HEAVIEST </p><p>GREEN LINE FIGHTING SINCE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE </p><p>JULY 4, 1984, BEIRUT SECURITY PLAN.  AS ALWAYS, IT IS </p><p>IMPOSSIBLE TO RECONSTRUCT THE EXACT SEQUENCE OF EVENTS. </p><p>HOWEVER IT APPEARS THAT THE FIGHTING BEGAN AS AN </p><p>EXCHANGE OF SHELLING (TANKS, ROCKETS, AND ARTILLERY BY </p><p>BOTH SIDES), THEN ESCALATED INTO BLIND SHELLING OF </p><p>RESIDENTIAL AREAS IN BOTH EAST AND WEST BEIRUT.  THE </p><p>HEAVIEST FIGHTING WAS APPARENTLY CONCENTRATED IN THE </p><p>PORT AND RAS AL-NABAH AREAS, WITH SHELLS HITTING THE </p><p>EASTERN RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS OF ASHRAFIYAH AND SIN </p><p>AL-FIL, AS WELL AS VARIOUS WEST BEIRUT NEIGHBORHOODS. </p><p>SCATTERED ROUNDS ALSO FELL IN THE GENERAL AREA OF AWKAR, </p><p>RABIYAH, AND NACCACHE, ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO EVIDENCE </p><p>THAT THESE AREAS WERE SPECIFICALLY TARGETED. </p><p> </p><p>3.  ALTHOUGH EXACT FIGURES ARE UNAVAILABLE, IT IS CLEAR </p><p>THAT CASUALTIES WERE HEAVIER THAN IS USUAL IN GREEN LINE </p><p>FIGHTING.  EMBASSY SOURCES REPORT SEEING UP TO </p><p>TWENTY-FIVE BODIES IN THE PORT AREA, AND THE LAF REPORTS </p><p>LOSING ONE KILLED AND TWELVE INJURED.  THERE ARE </p><p>UNCONFIRMED REPORTS THAT THE PSP AND AMAL REQUESTED A </p><p>CEASE-FIRE FOR 1600 HOURS LOCAL TIME IN ORDER TO </p><p>RETRIEVE THE DEAD AND WOUNDED FROM THE NO-MAN\'S LAND </p><p>SEPARATING THE WARRING FACTIONS.  THE RIZK TOWER IN EAST </p><p>BEIRUT WAS HIT BY A TANK ROUND, DESTROYING GOL </p><p>REPEATER EQUIPMENT AND DAMAGING THE ANTENNA OF A </p><p>GOVERNMENT TELEVISION STATION. </p><p> </p><p>4.  AUB SOURCES INDICATED THAT THE UNIVERSITY SUFFERED </p><p>ONLY LIGHT DAMAGE, ALTHOUGH ONE STUDENT SUFFERED </p><p>INJURIES REQUIRING HOSPITALIZATION.  SCHOOL IS OPEN </p><p>TODAY, MAY 7, BUT ATTENDANCE IS SPARSE.  THIS SOURCE </p><p>REPORTED THAT THE PREVAILING ATTITUDE AMONG AMERICAN </p><p>CITIZENS IN WEST BEIRUT IS ONE OF "DEPRESSION."  THEY </p><p>SEE NO DIRECT AND IMMEDIATE THREAT, SUCH AS OF THE LF OR </p><p>LAF CROSSING THE GREEN LINE TO ATTACK WEST BEIRUT, BUT </p><p>RECENT EVENTS HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO A FEELING OF </p><p>HOPELESSNESS ABOUT THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE OF LEBANON. </p><p>THIS SOURCE SAID THAT ALTHOUGH AUB AMCIT FACULTY MEMBERS </p><p>ARE NOT PLANNING TO LEAVE BEIRUT NOW IN RESPONSE TO A </p><p>PERCEIVED THREAT, MANY ARE PLANNING ON LEAVING LEBANON </p><p>AFTER THE END OF THE TERM IN LATE JUNE, EITHER BY NOT </p><p>RENEWING THEIR CONTRACTS OR BY TAKING A YEAR\'S </p><p>SABBATICAL. </p><p> </p><p>5.  THE SITUATION ON THE GROUND REMAINS TENSE MAY 7, </p><p>WITH MOST STORES REPORTEDLY CLOSED IN MUCH OF WEST </p><p>BEIRUT AND THE ASHRAFIYAH SECTION OF EAST BEIRUT.  THOSE </p><p>SHOPS THAT ARE OPEN ARE MOSTLY OF THE MOM AND POP FOOD </p><p>STORE VARIETY.  THE SITUATION APPROACHES NORMAL IN </p><p>EASTERN AREAS FURTHER FROM THE GREEN LINE.  ALL GREEN </p><p>LINE CROSSINGS ARE OFFICIALLY CLOSED. </p><p> </p><p>6.  COMMENT.  IT IS STILL TOO SOON TO TELL IF RECENT </p><p>OUTBREAKS REPRESENT SPONTANEOUS OUTBURSTS OR ARE </p><p>POLITICALLY MOTIVATED.  WE EXPECT THE SHARP FIGHTING </p><p>ALONG THE GREEN LINE TO CONTINUE.  HOWEVER, DESPITE </p><p>UNSUBSTANTIATED RUMORS OF TROOP MOVEMENTS AND FEARS OF </p><p>IMPENDING CLASHES, SUQ AL-GHARB HAS REMAINED CURIOUSLY </p><p>QUIET.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>BARTHOLOMEW </p><p> </p><p>NOTE BY OC/T:  HEADING AS RECEIVED.  CORRECTION TO FOLLOW. </p><p></p></div>
