<p>UNCLAS HARARE 002454 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PD, AF/S, AF/RA, AF/PDPA </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PREL, KPAO, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: ZIMBABWEAN GOVERNMENT BANS RETURN OF ITS OWN </p><p>CITIZENS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.   On November 8 government-owned media reported that the </p><p>    Government of Zimbabwe (GOZ) has imposed travel bans and </p><p>    visa requirements on a variety of people.  Among those </p><p>    affected are British government officials, members of the </p><p>    British Parliament, an American human rights activist, and </p><p>    journalists.  In a strange and disturbing twist, several of </p><p>    the journalists reported banned from entering Zimbabwe are </p><p>    Zimbabwean citizens. </p><p> </p><p>2.   The travel ban falls most heavily on about 70 members </p><p>    of the British government and parliament.  One American, </p><p>    John Prendergast of the International Crisis Group, and one </p><p>    Dutch citizen, Lodewijk Bouwens of Radio Netherlands, are </p><p>    also listed as banned.  More broadly, all British citizens </p><p>    are now required to apply for a visa (either at a </p><p>    Zimbabwean embassy or at the port of arrival) for entry </p><p>    into Zimbabwe.  Before this announcement, British citizens </p><p>    were permitted to enter Zimbabwe without a visa.  These </p><p>    moves appear to be in retaliation for the just-announced </p><p>    requirement that visas will be required of all Zimbabweans </p><p>    wishing to travel to the UK. </p><p> </p><p>3.   Most disturbing is the inclusion of eight Zimbabwean </p><p>    journalists on the list of persons prohibited from entering </p><p>    Zimbabwe.  The eight are all in London working for Short </p><p>    Wave Radio Africa, an independent station broadcasting </p><p>    Zimbabwe-specific programming.  According to the press </p><p>    report, the banned journalists are John Matinde, Gerry </p><p>    Jackson, Georgina Godwin, Simon Parkinson, Mandisa </p><p>    Mundawara, Violet Gonda, Tererai Karimakwenda and Graeme </p><p>    Counsel.  If the press report of the banning order is true, </p><p>    the Government of Zimbabwe has made 8 of its citizens </p><p>    stateless. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
