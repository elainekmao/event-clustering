SKODON, REASON: 1.5 (B) A </p><p>ND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) CHARGE FOLLOWED UP ARTICLE 98 DEMARCHE (REFS) IN HIS </p><p>INITIAL CALL ON PRIME (AND FOREIGN) MINISTER BERLUSCONI\'S </p><p>DIPLOMATIC ADVISER, GIANNI CASTELLANETA, AUGUST 30. </p><p>CASTELLANETA EXPRESSED APPRECIATION FOR THE INFORMATION </p><p>ALREADY PROVIDED, FROM WHICH HE HAD DRAWN IN WORKING OUT THE </p><p>GOI\'S APPROACH WITH THE MFA\'S LEGAL ADVISER.  HE REAFFIRMED </p><p>THE GOI VIEW THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO ACTION TAKEN AT THE AUG. </p><p>30-31 GYMNICH MEETING THAT WOULD PREJUDGE THE EU\'S DECISION. </p><p>HE DESCRIBED IN DETAIL THE PERSONAL EFFORT AT COORDINATION </p><p>WITH THE UK THAT HE HAD MADE WITH THE UK EMBASSY IN ROME. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) CASTELLANETA NOTED THAT THE MFA\'S LEGAL ADVISERS HAD </p><p>IDENTIFIED ONE POTENTIAL PROBLEM WITH THE DRAFT BILATERAL </p><p>AGREEMENT PROVIDED TO THE GOI: THE APPLICATION OF THE </p><p>AGREEMENT TO AMERICAN CITIZENS NOT ACTING IN AN OFFICIAL </p><p>CAPACITY.  CHARGE NOTED THAT THE USG DID NOT BELIEVE THERE </p><p>WAS ANY OBSTACLE IN THE STATUTE OF ROME TO INCLUDING ALL </p><p>CITIZENS OF A COUNTRY IN SUCH AN AGREEMENT, AND WASHINGTON </p><p>WOULD STRONGLY PREFER THAT ANY AGREEMENT NOT BE SO LIMITED. </p><p>CASTELLANETA SAID THE GOI WAS CONCERNED THAT THERE BE NO </p><p>BARRIER FOR EXTRADITION IN A CASE SUCH AS THAT OF JOHN WALKER </p><p>LINDH, THE US CITIZEN WHO FOUGHT WITH THE TALIBAN. </p><p> </p><p>3.

(NOTE: THE ARTICLE WAS THE MOST POSITIVE </p><p>PRESENTATION OF THE ARTICLE 98 ISSUE WE HAVE YET SEEN IN THE </p><p>ITALIAN PRESS.  IT SAYS ITALY WILL DEFINITELY SIGN AN </p><p>AGREEMENT WITH THE US, THOUGH IT IS IN NO HURRY.  IT WANTS </p><p>FIRST TO EXPLORE THE POSSIBILITY OF A COOPERATIVE EU-US </p><p>APPROACH TO THE SUBJECT, AND IS ACTIVELY COORDINATING WITH </p><p>LIKE-MINDED MEMBERS, WHICH ARE LISTED AS THE UK, PORTUGAL, </p><p>SPAIN AND THE NETHERLANDS.  EMBASSY WILL FORWARD TRANSLATION </p><p>OF ARTICLE SHORTLY.) </p><p> </p><p>OPERATION ENDURING FREEDOM </p><p> </p><p>4.

AS CASTELLANETA WAS AWARE, CENTCOM </p><p>AND ITALIAN MILITARY OFFICIALS HAD WORKED OUT A MUTUALLY </p><p>ACCEPTABLE DEFINITION OF THE MISSION AND DEPLOYMENT </p><p>TIMEFRAME.  CASTELLANETA AFFIRMED THAT PM BERLUSCONI WOULD </p><p>INFORM THE PARLIAMENT WHEN IT RESUMES WORK IN SEPTEMBER OF </p><p>THE INTENTION TO DEPLOY, BUT WOULD NOT NEED TO SEEK THE </p><p>PARLIAMENT\'S AUTHORIZATION. </p><p>SKODON </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME04238 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
