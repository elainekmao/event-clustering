HARARE 0998 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Officer Audu Besmer for reasons 1.5 b/d </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p>1. (C) Comprised mostly of workers and their families from </p><p>commercial farms, the number of IDPs in Zimbabwe could </p><p>surpass half a million in the coming months.  While the GOZ </p><p>has sought to deny the problem in the past, even accusing </p><p>temporary squatter settlements of being opposition training </p><p>camps, the Ministry of Labor has recently agreed to appoint </p><p>someone to liaise with UNDP on the issue.  UN Geneva is in </p><p>the process of hiring an OCHA-IDP Coordinator and that person </p><p>is expected here in mid September.  With the IDP situation </p><p>likely to deteriorate in the coming months, we urge early </p><p>consideration of funding to extend the OCHA-IDP Coordinator\'s </p><p>contract beyond the current 5-months; see action request in </p><p>paragraph 8.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Scope of the Problem </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>2. (U) Using the number of commercial farmers already </p><p>evicted, the average number of workers per farm, and their </p><p>average family size, George Olesh and Crispin Kukasha of UNDP </p><p>estimate the number of displaced commercial farm workers and </p><p>their families currently at 270 - 300,000.  They predict that </p><p>if the GOZ proceeds to evict farmers from all properties </p><p>listed for compulsory acquisition, the number of displaced </p><p>people could grow to 500 - 600,000, depending only on how </p><p>fast evictions progress.  Zimbabwe Community Development </p><p>Trust (ZCDT), a local NGO, undertook a mail-in survey of </p><p>commercial farmers in July - August 2002.  Of 3,200 surveys </p><p>sent, they received 346 responses.  According to ZCDT </p><p>Director Tim Neil, the results of the survey indicate that </p><p>151,240 farm workers are currently displaced and at risk. </p><p>Since there are approximately 5.2 people in each farm </p><p>worker\'s family, ZCDT estimates that about 786,448 people are </p><p>currently displaced as a result of farm invasions.  ZCDT\'s </p><p>survey also asked how many days of food supply farmers and </p><p>workers had as of August 8.  The average response was 54 </p><p>days.  99% of commercial farms are currently listed for </p><p>resettlement.  According to Neil, if resettlement proceeds </p><p>and the pattern of disenfranchisement continues on its </p><p>present trajectory, 1.3 million farm workers and their </p><p>families will be displaced in the coming months. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Mike Murray of Justice for Agriculture (JAG), also </p><p>conducted a survey for a German NGO, Organization Help, in </p><p>which he visited some 600 farms in Mashonaland, Manicaland </p><p>and Midlands in May and June 2002 to assess need for a </p><p>feeding program, and get a sense of overall food shortages. </p><p>His data indicate 150,000 farm workers were displaced at that </p><p>time and in need of assistance.  At 5.2 people per farm </p><p>worker family, this gives a figure of 780,000 people </p><p>displaced.  Based on the numbers of people seeking assistance </p><p>from political retribution since the March elections, Amani </p><p>Trust, a local human rights NGO, estimates the number of </p><p>opposition members and their families unable to return home </p><p>at 69,000.  In some cases, Amani Trust has provided bus fare </p><p>for MDC members to simply leave the country, after concluding </p><p>that they would be unable to return home in the near-term. </p><p> </p><p>Difficult Living Conditions </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>4. (U) Crispin Rukasha, National Program Officer at UNDP, </p><p>visited 15-20 commercial farms, where the farmer was already </p><p>evicted, from July 25 - August 8 to get a better sense of the </p><p>scope of the IDP problem and their individual circumstances. </p><p>He observed that settlers are occupying dwellings formerly </p><p>occupied by farm workers, and in most cases the workers are </p><p>now squatting on some other area of the farm.  Some have </p><p>moved into crowded dwellings in communal villages near the </p><p>farm.  In one case, a farmer who had not yet been evicted </p><p>would pick up his workers in the village every morning, drive </p><p>them to the farm for the day\'s work, then drive them back in </p><p>the evening.  Some displaced workers have made it to the </p><p>Harare area where they have squatted on unused land.  In </p><p>urban areas, most displaced workers have been forcibly </p><p>evicted by the police and army and told to return to their </p><p>original farms.  Very few have the option of returning "home" </p><p>to communal lands they originally came from.  75% are of </p><p>Malawian, Mozambican or Zambian ancestry, and in many cases </p><p>they have lived on the commercial farms for a generation or </p><p>more; some were born there. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) There is considerable animosity between settlers and </p><p>farm workers, and tensions are growing.  In a May 2002 </p><p>report, Amani Trust documents numerous instances of violence </p><p>and intimidation of farm workers by settlers and Zanu-PF </p><p>militants.  In general, new settlers plan to do the farm work </p><p>themselves, or hire others to help.  However, Mike Murray </p><p>reported observing on numerous occasions, settlers forcing </p><p>farm workers to continue working under "food for work" terms, </p><p>handing out short supplies of maize in exchange for work </p><p>done.  As Ref. B. suggests, conflicts between workers and </p><p>settlers will increase as evictions proceed, and more </p><p>competition for land sprouts with the rains. </p><p> </p><p>GOZ Beginning to Acknowledge Problem </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>6. (C) Until recently, the GOZ has sought to deny or gloss </p><p>over the IDP problem.  On August 29 Police arrested Frances </p><p>Lovemore of Amani Trust in Harare, as well as 17 workers </p><p>preparing an IDP camp in the Mazowe area (about 50 km north </p><p>of Harare).  The Mazowe land was leased from a farmer by </p><p>Amani Trust and ZCDT to accommodate IDPs.  Police have </p><p>charged Lovemore with possessing subversive material, but </p><p>Amani Trust has been unable to determine the charges pending </p><p>against the workers.  Last year, Police raided an Amani Trust </p><p>safe house, detaining 27 people for 2 days and accusing Amani </p><p>Trust of running an opposition training camp.  As a result of </p><p>such intimidation, many IDPs don\'t want to be identified as </p><p>such, fearing further victimization.  The majority of IDPs, </p><p>therefore are "displaced" on farms where they were previously </p><p>living and working, afraid to seek assistance but with no </p><p>protection, income, secure food source, or medical attention. </p><p> However, in the past two weeks, the Ministry of Labor has </p><p>agreed to assign a contact person to liaise with the UN on </p><p>the issue.  Delicately, UNDP has relied on the helpfulness of </p><p>local District Administrators, Provincial Administrators, and </p><p>CEOs of Rural District Councils to help identify farms where </p><p>displacement is occurring, and gain access to interview </p><p>workers. </p><p> </p><p>OCHA to Assign IDP Coordinator </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>7. (U) Thanks to U.S. funding, OCHA plans to assign an IDP </p><p>Coordinator to Harare.  According to George Olesh, Deputy </p><p>Coordinator for the Relief and Recovery Unit of the local </p><p>UNDP office, the UN office in Geneva is in the process of </p><p>considering applicants for the position.  UNDP expects the </p><p>incumbent to be in Harare by mid September.  UN Geneva has </p><p>advertised it as a 5-month position, with the possibility to </p><p>extend (funds permitting).  According to Olesh, the intention </p><p>is for the incumbent to act as the point person for all IDP </p><p>issues in Zimbabwe.  The incumbent\'s first priority will be </p><p>to work with local NGOs to gather better data on the extent </p><p>of the problem.  Olesh was vague about whether the </p><p>Coordinator would be able to design programs, as the OCHA-IDP </p><p>Unit\'s primary mandate is information gathering.  (Note: In </p><p>our view, the new OCHA person will inevitably have to </p><p>focus--quickly--on program design and implementation, an </p><p>effort which will require further assistance from donors. </p><p>End note.) </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p>8. (C) It is very difficult to provide precise estimates of </p><p>the IDP population because many are afraid to report their </p><p>plight, or they merge into extended family structures, and </p><p>different methods are used to count them.  However, Amani </p><p>Trust, UNDP, ZCDT and JAG numbers are consistent with each </p><p>other.  We have no reason to doubt that Amani Trust\'s </p><p>estimate of 69,000 displaced MDC supporters.  The UNDP </p><p>estimates focus on IDPs at highest risk, i.e. farms where the </p><p>farmer has already been evicted.  Thus there are at least </p><p>300,000 farm workers and their families displaced whose </p><p>plight is most acute.  ZCDT and JAG surveyed farmers still on </p><p>their properties, but extrapolated numerically to reflect </p><p>farms where the farmer is already gone.  Thus the figure </p><p>780,000 includes the UN figure and cases where the workers, </p><p>displaced economically and kicked out of their dwellings by </p><p>settlers, are simply in the pipeline to higher vulnerability </p><p>when the farmer is evicted.  By any interpretation, having </p><p>lost their residences and incomes, displaced farm workers and </p><p>their families are vulnerable to medical risks and lack basic </p><p>food and housing necessities.  Not only could their </p><p>numbers--and the consequent humanitarian challenges--quickly </p><p>rise in the coming months, but animosity with settlers is </p><p>making their bad situation worse.  While the government has </p><p>agreed to cooperate with the UN on the issue, the recent </p><p>arrest of workers at an IDP camp, and past harassment of IDPs </p><p>indicate the GOZ is more interested in hiding an embarrassing </p><p>problem than in meeting the needs of a displaced population </p><p>for whose plight it bears exclusive responsibility.  With no </p><p>break foreseen in the coming months on farm evictions, food </p><p>shortages, or the drought, the Department may wish to </p><p>consider funding the OCHA-IDP representative beyond the </p><p>5-month period envisioned in UNDP\'s current contract. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Comment continued.  In an August 28 meeting between </p><p>the Ambassador, AID and UNDP (including the ResRep), it was </p><p>agreed by all that local NGOs have a decent grasp of numbers </p><p>and the potential scope of the IDP issue.  However, there has </p><p>been little to no planning on how to design and implement </p><p>programs that address their needs.  Accordingly, our focus </p><p>will be more on what we can do to alleviate their suffering </p><p>than to simply track numbers and document their plight.  The </p><p>UNDP is aware of our concerns in this area.  End Comment. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
