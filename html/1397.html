<p>UNCLAS STATE 229049 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: CVIS, CMGT </p><p>SUBJECT: CIPRIS PROGRAM UPDATE: INS WILL COLLECT F/M/J FEE </p><p>BEGINNING IN 2001 </p><p> </p><p>REF: 97 STATE 57291 </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1. IN REFTEL, THE DEPARTMENT REPORTED ON INS\' CIPRIS </p><p>PROJECT, A CONGRESSIONALLY MANDATED PROGRAM FOR </p><p>ELECTRONICALLY MONITORING STUDENTS AND EXCHANGE VISITORS </p><p>IN THE U.S. ALTHOUGH CIPRIS HAS HAD A SLOW START SINCE </p><p>ITS 1995 CONCEPTION, INS HAS PLANS TO LAUNCH A BETA TEST </p><p>OF THE PROGRAM IN MID-2001 AND TO HAVE CIPRIS FULLY </p><p>IMPLEMENTED BY 2005. LEGISLATION SIGNED INTO LAW BY THE </p><p>PRESIDENT IN LATE OCTOBER HAS GIVEN INS THE GREEN LIGHT TO </p><p>COLLECT A FEE FROM NEW STUDENTS AND EXCHANGE VISITORS, TO </p><p>BEGIN AS SOON AS INS PUTS INTO PLACE ITS FEE COLLECTION </p><p>SYSTEM AND REGULATIONS. THE MECHANICS OF COLLECTING THE </p><p>FEE HAVE YET TO BE FINALIZED. HOWEVER, CONSULAR OFFICERS </p><p>WILL PLAY A KEY ROLE IN THE PROCESS BY REQUIRING PROOF </p><p>THAT STUDENT AND EXCHANGE VISITOR APPLICANTS HAVE PAID THE </p><p> </p><p>FEE BEFORE ISSUING A VISA. INS IS UNCERTAIN WHEN IT WILL </p><p>BEGIN COLLECTING THE FEE, BUT THE DEPARTMENT BELIEVES </p><p>POSTS WILL NOT NEED TO TAKE ANY ACTION BEFORE THE SPRING. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>WHAT IS CIPRIS? </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. THE COORDINATED INTERAGENCY PARTNERSHIP REGULATING </p><p>INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS (CIPRIS) GREW OUT OF AN INS TASK </p><p>FORCE ESTABLISHED IN 1995 TO REVIEW HOW TO GATHER </p><p>INFORMATION FOR MONITORING F, M AND J VISA HOLDERS IN THE </p><p>U.S. THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE TASK FORCE TO CREATE AN </p><p>ELECTRONIC TRACKING SYSTEM FOR FOREIGN STUDENTS AND </p><p>EXCHANGE VISITORS WAS FORMALIZED IN SECTION 641 OF THE </p><p>ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION REFORM AND IMMIGRANT RESPONSIBILITY </p><p>ACT OF 1996 (IIRIRA). THIS SECTION REQUIRES ALL POST- </p><p>SECONDARY SCHOOLS AND EXCHANGE VISITOR PROGRAMS TO PROVIDE </p><p>INFORMATION ON NATIONALS OF ALL COUNTRIES BY JANUARY 1, </p><p>2003. THE TRACKING SYSTEM WAS DESIGNED TO BE SELF-FUNDED </p><p>WITH FEES COLLECTED FROM FOREIGN STUDENTS AND EXCHANGE </p><p>VISITORS. INS LAUNCHED A CIPRIS PILOT PROJECT AT 21 </p><p>SCHOOLS IN THE SOUTHEAST U.S. IN 1997 TO TEST THE </p><p>FEASIBILITY OF AN ELECTRONIC TRACKING SYSTEM, WITH A VIEW </p><p>TO EXPANDING THE PROGRAM NATIONWIDE BY THE </p><p>CONGRESSIONALLY-ESTABLISHED DEADLINE. </p><p> </p><p>3. WHEN FULLY IMPLEMENTED, CIPRIS WILL BE AN ALL- </p><p>ELECTRONIC SYSTEM WHICH WILL GIVE INS AND CONSULAR </p><p>OFFICERS IMMEDIATE INFORMATION ON AN F, M OR J HOLDER\'S </p><p>STATUS. INITIALLY OVERSEAS POSTS WILL HAVE ACCESS TO THE </p><p>CIPRIS DATA BASE THROUGH INS DIRECT, ENABLING THEM TO </p><p>VERIFY F, M OR J INFORMATION SUCH AS WHEN AN I-20 OR IAP- </p><p>66 WAS ISSUED AND WHETHER THE STUDENT IS CURRENTLY IN </p><p>FULL-TIME ATTENDANCE AT A SCHOOL. EVENTUALLY POSTS WILL </p><p>HAVE DIRECT COMPUTER LINKAGE TO THE CIPRIS SYSTEM, GIVING </p><p>CONSULAR OFFICERS IMMEDIATE ACCESS TO STUDENT AND EXCHANGE </p><p>VISITOR DATA WHEN INTERVIEWING APPLICANTS AND ADJUDICATING </p><p>CASES. ISSUANCE DATA WILL BE DOWNLOADED INTO THE SYSTEM </p><p>AND MADE AVAILABLE TO SCHOOLS AS WELL AS TO INS, CREATING </p><p>A SEAMLESS FLOW OF INFORMATION WHICH SHOULD NEARLY </p><p>ELIMINATE STUDENT VISA FRAUD AND SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCE THE </p><p>AMOUNT OF PAPERWORK CONSULAR OFFICERS REQUIRE TO </p><p>ADJUDICATE A STUDENT OR EXCHANGE VISITOR VISA. </p><p> </p><p>THE BATTLE OVER FEES </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. ALTHOUGH THE IDEA OF A CIPRIS PROGRAM HAS BEEN POPULAR </p><p>WITH CONGRESS, IT HAS NOT BEEN RECEIVED WELL BY MANY </p><p>SCHOOLS AND PROGRAMS WHICH HOST INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS AND </p><p>EXCHANGE VISITORS. THESE SCHOOLS HAVE BALKED AT SOME </p><p>PROVISIONS OF SECTION 641, IN PARTICULAR THE REQUIREMENT </p><p>IN THAT LEGISLATION THAT SCHOOLS COLLECT THE CIPRIS FEE. </p><p>THE EDUCATIONAL COMMUNITY\'S TOOTH-AND-NAIL OPPOSITION TO </p><p>THIS PROVISION VIRTUALLY ENDED ALL CIPRIS-RELATED ACTIVITY </p><p>FOR MUCH OF 2000. INS FINALLY OVERCAME THIS OPPOSITION BY </p><p>INTRODUCING LEGISLATION WHICH TRANSFERRED THE FEE </p><p>COLLECTION RESPONSIBILITY FROM HOST SCHOOLS AND EXCHANGE </p><p>PROGRAMS TO INS. THIS LEGISLATION WAS ATTACHED TO HR 3767 </p><p>-- THE VISA WAIVER BILL -- AND WAS SIGNED INTO LAW BY THE </p><p>PRESIDENT ON OCTOBER 30, 2000. IN SPITE OF THIS FIX, </p><p>CIPRIS STILL LIVES UNDER A SWORD OF DAMOCLES IN THE FORM </p><p>OF A PROPOSED BILL WHICH WOULD REPEAL THE PROGRAM. THIS </p><p>LEGISLATION, WHICH HAS THE BACKING OF MANY COLLEGES AND </p><p>UNIVERSITIES, MAY BE INTRODUCED IN THE NEXT CONGRESS, </p><p>ALTHOUGH THE DEPARTMENT BELIEVES ITS PASSAGE IS UNLIKELY. </p><p> </p><p>5. INS MADE SEVERAL MAJOR CONCESSIONS ON THE FEE ISSUE, </p><p>NOTABLY ON WHO QUALIFIES FOR REDUCED OR FEE-EXEMPT STATUS, </p><p>TO ENSURE ITS SUCCESS. BUT THE FEE AMENDMENT HAS AT LAST </p><p>GIVEN THE SERVICE THE FISCAL TOOL IT NEEDED TO GO FULL- </p><p>STEAM ON CIPRIS IMPLEMENTATION. INS\' ABILITY TO COLLECT </p><p>THE FEE IS VITAL TO THE PROGRAM\'S SUCCESS; CIPRIS IS </p><p>EXPECTED TO BE SELF-FUNDING AND THE SERVICE NEEDS THE </p><p>CIPRIS REVENUE TO TAKE THE PROGRAM BEYOND THE PLANNING </p><p>STAGE. THE AMENDMENT ALLOWS INS TO COLLECT A $95 FEE FOR </p><p>MOST STUDENTS AND EXCHANGE VISITORS, AN AMOUNT INS </p><p>CALCULATED WAS A PER-CAPITA MINIMUM TO PAY FOR THE </p><p>PROGRAM. SOME FS, MS AND J\'S, NOTABLY THOSE ATTENDING </p><p>SECONDARY SCHOOL, EXCHANGE VISITORS SPONSORED BY THE USG, </p><p>AND F-2, J-2 AND M-2 APPLICANTS, WILL BE EXEMPT FROM THE </p><p>FEE. OTHERS, SPECIFICALLY AU PAIRS, CAMP COUNSELORS AND </p><p>SUMMER WORK/TRAVEL PARTICIPANTS, WILL PAY A REDUCED, $40 </p><p>FEE. </p><p> </p><p>6. BECAUSE OF THE LONG HIATUS IN CIPRIS DEVELOPMENT WHICH </p><p>OCCURRED WHILE THE FEE COLLECTION BATTLE WAS BEING FOUGHT, </p><p>INS WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY NOT BE ABLE TO MEET CONGRESS\' </p><p>JANUARY 1, 2003 TIMETABLE TO HAVE THE PROGRAM UP AND </p><p>RUNNING WORLDWIDE. HOWEVER, INS PLANS TO ESTABLISH A BETA </p><p>TEST OF CIPRIS BY MID-2001, TO BE CONDUCTED IN A SELECT </p><p>GROUP OF SCHOOLS AND EXCHANGE VISITOR PROGRAMS IN THE </p><p>BOSTON AREA. FOLLOWING THIS BETA TEST, INS WILL GRADUALLY </p><p>PHASE IN CIPRIS REGION-BY-REGION UNTIL ALL SCHOOLS AND </p><p> </p><p>EXCHANGE VISITOR PROGRAMS ARE COVERED, PROBABLY SOMETIME </p><p>IN 2005. POSTS WILL BE TIED INTO THE CIPRIS SYSTEM AS OUR </p><p>DATASHARE LINKS WITH INS ARE DEVELOPED. </p><p> </p><p>WHAT THE HR 3767 FEE AMENDMENT MEANS FOR POSTS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>7. INS IS NOW HARD AT WORK DEVELOPING A SIMPLE, NO-FRILLS </p><p>SYSTEM FOR COLLECTING THE F/M/J FEE, IN AN EFFORT TO GET </p><p>CIPRIS FUNDS FLOWING AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. AMONG OTHER </p><p>TASKS, INS\' CIPRIS TEAM IS DRAFTING FEDERAL REGISTER </p><p>REGULATIONS AND GUIDELINES FOR FEE COLLECTION, AND IS </p><p>DEVELOPING THE FORM (DESIGNATED AN ""-901" BY INS) WHICH </p><p>STUDENTS WILL SUBMIT TO THE "LOCKBOX" ALONG WITH THEIR FEE </p><p>PAYMENT. INS HOPES TO HAVE BOTH OF THESE ITEMS COMPLETED </p><p>BY EARLY 2001, AT WHICH TIME IT CAN BEGIN COLLECTING THE </p><p>FEE FROM NEW STUDENTS AND EXCHANGE VISITORS. ONCE </p><p>IMPOSED, INS WILL COLLECT THE FEE FROM ALL NON-EXEMPT </p><p>FIRST-TIME STUDENTS AND EXCHANGE VISITORS REGARDLESS OF </p><p>WHETHER THEIR SCHOOL OR PROGRAM IS YET PARTICIPATING IN </p><p>CIPRIS. </p><p> </p><p>8. AS INS HAS OUTLINED, STUDENT AND EXCHANGE VISITOR VISA </p><p>APPLICANTS WILL BE REQUIRED TO PAY THE CIPRIS FEE AFTER </p><p>THEY OBTAIN AN I-20 OR IAP-66, BUT BEFORE THEY APPLY FOR </p><p>THE VISA. THE FEE IS NON-REFUNDABLE, EVEN IF THE APPLICANT </p><p>FAILS TO OBTAIN A VISA. BANK ONE (A CHICAGO-BASED BANK) </p><p>WILL BE THE LOCK-BOX FOR THE FEES. AFTER RECEIVING THE I- </p><p>20 OR IAP-66, A PROSPECTIVE STUDENT OR EXCHANGE VISITOR </p><p>WILL HAVE TO SUBMIT THE I-901 FORM AND PAYMENT TO BANK ONE </p><p>(FORM AND PAYMENT INFORMATION WILL BE AVAILABLE ONLINE ON </p><p>BOTH THE INS AND BANK ONE WEBSITES). THEY MAY PAY BY </p><p>CREDIT CARD, BANK DRAFT, OR EVEN CASH. UPON RECEIPT OF </p><p>THE I-901 AND PAYMENT, BANK ONE WILL ISSUE A RECEIPT, IN </p><p>THE FORM OF INS\' FAMILIAR I-797 "NOTICE OF ACTION." THIS </p><p>FEE RECEIPT WILL BE MAILED TO THE APPLICANT AT THE ADDRESS </p><p>DESIGNATED ON THE I-901. THE APPLICANT WILL PRESENT THE I- </p><p>797 FEE RECEIPT, ALONG WITH THE I-20 OR IAP-66, AT THE </p><p>TIME OF VISA APPLICATION. PRESUMABLY STUDENT AND EXCHANGE </p><p>VISITOR APPLICANTS WHO DO NOT HAVE PROOF OF CIPRIS FEE </p><p>PAYMENT IN THE FORM OF THE I-797 RECEIPT WILL BE REFUSED </p><p>221(G). </p><p> </p><p>A WORK IN PROGRESS </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>9. AT THIS POINT, IT IS DIFFICULT TO SAY WITH ANY </p><p>CERTAINTY WHEN INS WILL BEGIN COLLECTING THE CIPRIS FEE, </p><p>ALTHOUGH THE SERVICE HOPES TO HAVE FEE COLLECTIONS UP AND </p><p> </p><p>RUNNING BY EARLY 2001. MANY ISSUES RELATING TO THE FEE </p><p>PAYMENT REQUIREMENTS HAVE YET TO BE WORKED OUT. FOR </p><p>EXAMPLE, INS AND BANK ONE ARE STILL DELIBERATING ON HOW </p><p>BEST TO REPLACE LOST OR MISDIRECTED I-797 RECEIPTS. THE </p><p>SYSTEM IS DESIGNED TO WORK BEST FOR THOSE WITH INTERNET </p><p>ACCESS, BUT FOR STUDENTS NOT CONNECTED TO THE WEB, PAYING </p><p>THE FEE MAY BE MORE PROBLEMATICAL. AND EDUCATING THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL STUDENT AND EXCHANGE VISITOR COMMUNITY ABOUT </p><p>THE NEW FEE WILL BE A MAJOR UNDERTAKING WHICH WILL FALL </p><p>MOSTLY ON INS BUT WITH WHICH POSTS, AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS </p><p>IN THE PROGRAM, MAY BE CALLED ON TO ASSIST. </p><p> </p><p>10. THE VISA OFFICE HAS BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH INS TO </p><p>ENSURE THAT THE CIPRIS PROGRAM WILL HAVE A MINIMAL IMPACT </p><p>ON OUR POSTS ABROAD AND AT THE SAME TIME WILL SERVE OUR </p><p>OWN LONG-TERM GOALS OF REDUCING WORKLOAD AND ELIMINATING </p><p>FRAUD IN THE STUDENT AND EXCHANGE VISITOR PROGRAMS. WE ARE </p><p>CONFIDENT THAT THE PROGRAM ULTIMATELY WILL ACHIEVE ALL </p><p>THESE ENDS. WE WILL CONTINUE TO COORDINATE CLOSELY WITH </p><p>INS AS THE FEE COLLECTION SYSTEM, AND CIPRIS ITSELF, ARE </p><p>CLOSER TO REALITY. WE WILL KEEP POSTS CLOSELY APPRISED OF </p><p>ANY NEW DEVELOPMENTS, PARTICULARLY AS THEY RELATE TO OUR </p><p>ROLE IN FEE COLLECTIONS IN THE COMING MONTHS. </p><p>TALBOTT </p><p> </p><p>NOTE: POUCH ADDRESSEES PROTECTED BY IRM/MSO </p><p></p></div>
