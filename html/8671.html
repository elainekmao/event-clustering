<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 COLOMBO 001025 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR D, SA, SA/INS, S/CT, SA/PD; NSC FOR </p><p>E. MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:   DECL:  06-12-13 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, KPAO, CE, JA, NO, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  Tigers stick to hard-line stance, essentially </p><p>rejecting Tokyo\'s call to re-engage GSL right away </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  (A) Ops Center/Colombo 06-12-13 telecon </p><p> </p><p>-      (B) Colombo-SA/INS 06/11/03 unclass e-mail </p><p>-      (C) Colombo 1018, and previous </p><p>-      (D) Tokyo 3772, and previous (Notal) </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador E. Ashley Wills. </p><p>Reasons:  1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  Reacting with haste to the Tokyo </p><p>donors conference, the Tamil Tigers restated their view </p><p>that the GSL must take quick steps to form an interim </p><p>structure in the north/east.  The Tigers also </p><p>underscored that they did not accept the understandings </p><p>reached at Tokyo.  In spite of the stark message, the </p><p>government has little choice but to keep plugging away </p><p>as it tries to break the deadlock.  Suggested press </p><p>guidance is contained in Para 9.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) TIGER STATEMENT:  Not wasting much time, the </p><p>Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) organization has </p><p>reacted to the Tokyo donors conference.  (Note: Please </p><p>see Refs C-D for reporting on the Tokyo conference, </p><p>which was held June 9-10.)  As is the group\'s recent </p><p>custom, the LTTE response -- which was relatively terse </p><p>by Tiger standards -- was posted on the pro-LTTE website </p><p>"TamilNet."  (Note:  The statement was issued late June </p><p>11 local time and was passed to SA/INS in Ref B.  We are </p><p>not certain whether the "TamilNet" text contained all of </p><p>the statement, but it seemed to encapsulate the main </p><p>points.  Also, while most LTTE statements are issued in </p><p>the name of its London-based spokesman Anton </p><p>Balasingham, this one was characterized as an "official" </p><p>message from the group\'s "headquarters" in northern Sri </p><p>Lanka.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) In the statement, the LTTE stuck to its recent </p><p>hard-line stance, essentially demanding that the GSL </p><p>take quick steps to give the group interim control of </p><p>the north/east.  (Note:  Since late April when the LTTE </p><p>left the peace talks and said it would not participate </p><p>at Tokyo, the group has been harping on the issue of </p><p>forming an interim structure in the north/east -- see </p><p>Ref C.)  Denigrating the remarks made on the topic by </p><p>Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe at Tokyo, </p><p>the LTTE stated: </p><p> </p><p>"We are disappointed to note that the prime minister\'s </p><p>statement does not offer anything new...The prime </p><p>minister has not responded to our call for a draft </p><p>framework for an innovative and effective political- </p><p>administrative structure.  Contrary to Mr. </p><p>Wickremesinghe\'s statement to the international donor </p><p>community, we seriously differ in perception in </p><p>connection with what the LTTE leadership proposes and </p><p>what his government offers.  While our leadership has </p><p>proposed an interim administrative framework, a </p><p>political-administrative structure for the northeast </p><p>with wider participation of the LTTE, the Sri Lankan </p><p>government has offered a council with a structure and </p><p>mechanism for the development of the region." </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Regarding Tokyo, the LTTE made clear that it </p><p>resented the government\'s interactions with the donors, </p><p>stating: </p><p> </p><p>"The compulsions that arose from severe economic and </p><p>political bankruptcy have compelled the government to </p><p>seek the ultimate refuge in the so-called `international </p><p>safety net\' to resolve the economic and political crisis </p><p>of the country.  By seeking this `safety net\' the </p><p>Colombo regime has shifted the peace process from third </p><p>party facilitation to the realm of international </p><p>arbitration by formidable external forces that has far- </p><p>reaching consequences for the political and economic </p><p>destiny of the island." </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Finally, noting that it was not present at </p><p>Tokyo (though not mentioning that this was its own </p><p>choice), the statement underlined that the Tigers did </p><p>not feel bound by understandings reached there, stating: </p><p> </p><p>"The LTTE was not involved in the deliberations or in </p><p>the formulation of these declarations.  We have not been </p><p>consulted on the set of propositions and resolutions </p><p>enunciated in the Tokyo Declaration.  The Colombo </p><p>government, with the active assistance of the </p><p>facilitator and its international `tactical allies\' has </p><p>formulated this strategic paper to superimpose its own </p><p>agenda on the LTTE.  This is unacceptable to us." </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) GSL REVIEWING STATEMENT:  As of late June 12 </p><p>(local), the government has not yet responded to this </p><p>latest LTTE message.  Ambassador Nanda Godage, a </p><p>director at the GSL\'s Peace Secretariat, told us that </p><p>the government was carefully reviewing the message, but </p><p>had not yet decided how to respond.  He said he thought </p><p>any response would take at least several days in coming, </p><p>as the GSL discussed the matter with the Norwegian </p><p>government facilitators and Japanese government </p><p>representatives.  (Note:  Per Refs B-C, there has been </p><p>some talk of Japanese representatives trying to meet </p><p>with the LTTE soon in order to brief the group on Tokyo </p><p>among other items.  It is not clear, however, whether </p><p>these plans have been finalized.) </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) OTHER REACTION:  No one that Mission has touched </p><p>base with was particularly surprised by the substance of </p><p>the LTTE\'s June 11 statement.  The general feeling was </p><p>that the group was simply restating its positions.  In </p><p>discussions with contacts, two items that did stand out </p><p>were the following: </p><p> </p><p>-- Speed of the response:  Ambassador Godage told us </p><p>that he was a bit surprised by how quickly the LTTE </p><p>reacted to Tokyo.  He said he had originally thought it </p><p>would take the group at least several days to mull </p><p>things over and get its reaction out.  Instead, the </p><p>group took all of one day to send out a response. </p><p>Godage said he wondered whether the group, embarrassed </p><p>by the success of the Tokyo meeting, had decided to </p><p>react quickly and viscerally in re-emphasizing its hard- </p><p>line position. </p><p> </p><p>-- Blunt tone:  Other contacts flagged what they saw as </p><p>the very blunt tone of the LTTE\'s statement.  Roman </p><p>Catholic Bishop for Jaffna Thomas Savundranayagam told </p><p>us that he thought the tone of the statement was quite </p><p>telling and indicated just how serious the group was on </p><p>the issue of an interim administration. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) COMMENT:  In spite of the LTTE\'s stark message, </p><p>the government has little choice but to keep plugging </p><p>away as it tries to break the deadlock.  The LTTE\'s </p><p>statement, unfortunately, gave the government very, very </p><p>little to work with.  Despite calls at Tokyo for the </p><p>group to re-engage in the peace talks, for example, the </p><p>group gave zero indication that it planned to do this </p><p>soon.  All in all, the latest statement serves to </p><p>highlight how difficult it is to deal with the LTTE, </p><p>especially in light of the group\'s truculent mood.  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU) SUGGESTED PRESS GUIDANCE:  We recommend that </p><p>Department not comment on the LTTE\'s statement, allowing </p><p>the Sri Lankan government to have the spotlight.  If </p><p>Department does make a comment, however, we would </p><p>suggest something along the following lines: </p><p> </p><p>Begin text: </p><p> </p><p>We regard the Tigers\' reaction as precipitate.  The </p><p>international community at the Tokyo conference </p><p>unanimously agreed that the Tigers should be invited to </p><p>take part in the development of Sri Lanka\'s north and </p><p>east.  The Tigers should accept this invitation.  The </p><p>details of a provisional arrangement in the north and </p><p>east should be worked out at the negotiating table. </p><p> </p><p>End text. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
