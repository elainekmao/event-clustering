As part of an ongoing effort to support the Labor </p><p>Ministry, USAID/Guatemala engaged the services of IRM through </p><p>a buy-in to the Interagency Agreement between USAID and the </p><p>U.S. General Services Administration.   The modest </p><p>project--$200,000--helps establish an information technology </p><p>unit within the Labor Ministry and pilot projects (e.g., </p><p>direct communications between regional offices and the </p><p>ministry, labor inspection via palm pilots, and systems </p><p>administration). </p><p> </p><p>11.  During 2001 USAID provided $70,000 to the Institute for </p><p>Transforming Conflicts for the Construction of Peace in </p><p>Guatemala (INTRAPAZ) through a cooperative agreement with </p><p>Rafael Landivar University to provide in-country training in </p><p>successful dialogue, relationship-building and </p><p>labor/management conflict-resolution techniques.  Target </p><p>groups included individuals from management, labor, the </p><p>Ministry of Labor, and a corps of future trainers and </p><p>mediators. </p><p> </p><p>USAID Regional Programs: PROALCA II Labor Component </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>12.  Project budget:  $6.3 m. </p><p>Project duration:  July 20, 2002 ) September 30, 2007 </p><p>Participants:  Ministries of Labor of Central America, </p><p>Panama, Belize and the Dominican Republic, Ministers, Vice </p><p>Ministers, other labor officials, union organizations, civil </p><p>society, among others. </p><p>Implementing Unit:  Secretariat for Central American Economic </p><p>Integration (SIECA) </p><p> </p><p>Project Goal: Supporting efforts to improve the functioning </p><p>of regional labor markets while strengthening the protection </p><p>of core labor standards. </p><p> </p><p>Justification:  Enhanced competitiveness in global markets </p><p>requires that Central America improve the functioning of its </p><p>labor markets while also strengthening the protection of core </p><p>labor standards.  Improved labor-management relations are </p><p>essential to achieve the total quality production required by </p><p>a global marketplace.  Moreover, satisfactory protection of </p><p>core labor standards is necessary to maintain access to </p><p>important markets.  In addition, for Central America to take </p><p>maximum advantage of the increased opportunities presented by </p><p>more integrated regional and global markets, its labor force </p><p>must be better trained and more productive and its labor laws </p><p>and regulations must be harmonized.  Also, rigidities in the </p><p>region%s labor market must be addressed by allowing for </p><p>flexibility and sufficient labor mobility to permit the </p><p>timely and voluntary reallocation of workers to newer and </p><p>more competitive economic activities.  To achieve this </p><p>result, the following interventions will be promoted: (a) </p><p>labor ministries capacity enhanced, (b) competitiveness of </p><p>the region\'s labor force increased, and (c) harmonization of </p><p>labor laws and regulations in the region. </p><p> </p><p>At the end of the strategy period, the following achievements </p><p>are expected: </p><p> </p><p>-- More active and effective leadership of labor ministries </p><p>in economic policy-making relative to labor. </p><p>-- Better functioning of labor markets in specific areas </p><p>addressed by PROALCA II. </p><p>-- Establishment of one or more Alternative Dispute </p><p>Resolution Mechanisms in the region. </p><p>-- The development of a corps of trained technical staffs in </p><p>the labor ministries of Central America. </p><p>-- Shift from public occupational training in public-private </p><p>skills-based training. </p><p>-- Harmonization of skills standards and standards of methods </p><p>of certification. </p><p>-- Initiation of skills certification program throughout </p><p>region. </p><p>-- Increased voluntary mobility of workers inside their </p><p>countries. </p><p>-- Changes in labor codes to incorporate policies that </p><p>increase labor flexibility without weakening protection of </p><p>core labor rights. </p><p>-- Region wide respect for core labor rights. </p><p>-- Changes in national legislation to conform to regional </p><p>norms. </p><p>-- Increased convergence of labor laws in the region. </p><p> </p><p>USAID Regional Programs: PROALCA I Results </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>13.  Our regional Program in Support of Central American </p><p>Participation in the Free Trade Area of the Americas (PROALCA </p><p>I) Labor Component ran from 1995-2002 and had its objective </p><p>"More Equitable and Better Functioning Labor Markets."  The </p><p>labor component expended $ 5.0 million.  This was </p><p>accomplished through programs designed to support Central </p><p>American efforts to strengthen the protection of </p><p>internationally recognized core labor standards, improve </p><p>labor-management relations, and modernize labor markets.  The </p><p>activity also helped improve workplace conditions and better </p><p>enable workers to receive their fair share of gains generated </p><p>by trade expansion and productivity increases. </p><p> </p><p>PROALCA supported the Ministries of Labor of Central America, </p><p>Belize and the Dominican Republic.  The program provided </p><p>assistance for policy reform and for effective policy </p><p>implementation, as needed.  The types of assistance provided </p><p>included specialized technical assistance, horizontal </p><p>(inter-ministerial) cooperation programs, short-term training </p><p>programs, observational trips and support for regional </p><p>seminars, workshops and fora. </p><p> </p><p>USAID-IDB-SIECA Labor Modernization Project:  This program </p><p>was designed to assist Central American efforts to modernize </p><p>labor markets by supporting regional and national dialogue on </p><p>topics related to labor markets and hemispheric integration, </p><p>globalization and trade policy, among others.  The project </p><p>also provided opportunities for the region,s countries to </p><p>participate in pilot activities in methods of alternative </p><p>dispute resolution and occupational safety standards. </p><p> </p><p>The program financed technical assistance and consulting </p><p>services for the eight Ministries of Labor in the formulation </p><p>of national and regional policies, and the modernization of </p><p>labor markets.  Thirty-six national seminars and workshops </p><p>were developed in the region.  1,631 persons (478 women and </p><p>1,153 men) from the public and private sector, trade unions </p><p>and NGOs were trained on subjects related to social dialogue, </p><p>information systems, alternative methods of dispute </p><p>resolution, occupational health and safety, and modernization </p><p>of the labor market. </p><p> </p><p>This subcomponent supported the development of a web-based </p><p>labor information system.  This system facilitates the </p><p>research of statistics on occupation, income and wages, </p><p>vulnerable groups, labor legislation, agreements and </p><p>ministerial meetings, international legislation, social </p><p>dialogue, trade union information, economic and demographic </p><p>data, and social standards, and provides a virtual library on </p><p>labor topics.   Training on the use of the system and the </p><p>necessary computer equipment and software were also provided </p><p>to the ministries. This component finished on September 30, </p><p>2001 (although a no-cost extension was approved for an </p><p>additional year and activities continue with IDB financing). </p><p> </p><p>Labor Advisor: This consulting service provided the Ministers </p><p>of Labor with advice on the status of the hemispheric </p><p>economic and social integration process, and how labor issues </p><p>are incorporated into that process, as well as advice on </p><p>ministerial modernization processes.  It also helped the </p><p>Ministers define appropriate social, economic and labor </p><p>policies. </p><p> </p><p>This subcomponent facilitated the exchange of technical </p><p>assistance, training, and best practices among the Central </p><p>American Ministries of Labor and between Central America and </p><p>those from outside the region through a horizontal </p><p>cooperation program and site visits. A total of 82 labor </p><p>officials participated in the hemispheric cooperation program </p><p>in areas such as: modernization of labor markets, automation </p><p>of labor information, labor relations, labor inspection, and </p><p>certification of labor skills.   Five extraordinary </p><p>ministerial meetings were supported as well as the XVI </p><p>Council of Ministries of Labor of Central America.  Under </p><p>this contract, a total of 866 (652 men and 214 women) Labor </p><p>officials participated in 18 seminars and workshops on </p><p>employment policies, productivity, and modernization of the </p><p>labor markets. </p><p> </p><p>With the support of this subcomponent, the Secretary of Labor </p><p>and Social Welfare of Mexico and the Ministers of Labor of </p><p>the region signed an operational agreement on November 23, </p><p>2001.  This agreement will allow the transference, at a </p><p>minimum cost, of successful experiences that were accumulated </p><p>by the participation of Mexico in the North American Free </p><p>Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in aspects such as labor skills </p><p>certification programs and systems for the establishment of </p><p>norms, among others.  Probably the most significant </p><p>achievements of this subcomponent, however, have been the </p><p>creation of an ad-hoc secretariat of the Central American </p><p>Ministers of Labor and the successful garnering of assistance </p><p>from other donors for the labor sector in Central America. </p><p> </p><p>Strengthening Labor Management Relations:  This program </p><p>concluded in November 2000 and was developed through a US </p><p>$1.6 million cooperative agreement awarded to FUNPADEM.  Its </p><p>purpose was to support the modernization of the labor </p><p>inspection departments in each ministry, and to strengthen </p><p>ministerial abilities to resolve labor conflicts and enhance </p><p>labor-management relations. </p><p> </p><p>This assistance included the design of a modern management </p><p>system to enhance the inspection process through improved </p><p>monitoring and quality control of inspections and </p><p>establishing a database on businesses, workers, payrolls, </p><p>frequency and geographic locations of violations. </p><p> </p><p>Training activities on inspection, ministerial operations, </p><p>and labor issues in the context of economic globalization and </p><p>hemispheric integration surpassed expectations.  1,230 (923 </p><p>men and 307 women) representatives from the labor ministries, </p><p>unions and management participated in six workshops, fourteen </p><p>courses, six seminars and six video conferences </p><p> </p><p>Child Labor Program: The Child Labor Eradication Program </p><p>funded by USAID was successfully completed in September 2001. </p><p> FUNPADEM provided sub grants to and monitored the national </p><p>NGOs, which implemented the pilot projects in each Central </p><p>American country according to the selected high-risk areas </p><p>identified by the Ministers of Labor (Guatemala-quick lime </p><p>production). </p><p> </p><p>NGOs were provided with the equipment and furniture required </p><p>to implement activities.  The program developed regional </p><p>workshops, reinforcement school courses, seminars, </p><p>socio-economic diagnosis, and provided technical assistance </p><p>to encourage more than one thousand children (586 girls and </p><p>624 boys), adolescents, families and teachers to participate </p><p>in educational and training activities.  A total of 547 </p><p>children will stop working to study, 147 will not study, and </p><p>the rest will combine both activities.  NGOs obtained 193 </p><p>scholarships, 100 from the IPEC-ILO project and the rest from </p><p>the private sector and municipalities. </p><p>HAMILTON </p><p></p></div>
