<p>S E C R E T AMMAN 003174 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/11/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, JO, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDAN AND IRAQI OIL </p><p> </p><p>REF: AMMAN 1782 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMBASSADOR EDWARD W. GNEHM FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (S) During the executive session of the U.S.-Jordan Joint </p><p>Military Commission (JMC) in Amman on May 28, DOD U/S for </p><p>Policy Douglas Feith, drawing on guidance prepared for his </p><p>trip, told the Jordanians that the U.S. would "work to fill </p><p>any gaps" should Jordan\'s oil supply from Iraq be cut. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S) Post would appreciate information on what actions are </p><p>envisioned to actualize this commitment.  Are there </p><p>contingency plans?  Who in Washington has the lead?  There </p><p>are a number of practical factors that will impact on our </p><p>ability to replace Jordan\'s aid supply from Iraq, some of </p><p>which are described in reftel.  For example, the port of </p><p>Aqaba does handle crude oil, but essentially to load tankers </p><p>using gravity flow.  If imports via Aqaba are foreseen, the </p><p>port will need to develop the means to lift oil and petroleum </p><p>products from ship to shore.  We are prepared to work closely </p><p>with Washington planners to ensure that these and other </p><p>considerations are taken into account. </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
