The provincial governor was the focus of </p><p>protests that turned into riots on Friday by locals </p><p>complaining of slow food and tent distribution in the </p><p>disaster area, papers report.  Officials stated that rescue </p><p>operations in the wreckage have come to an end. The </p><p>earthquake struck the eastern province of Bingol early on </p><p>Thursday, killing at least 167, including 84 boys and one </p><p>teacher at the state-run school.  The government promised a </p><p>full investigation into allegations that the school </p><p>dormitory had been shoddily built by corrupt contractors. </p><p>Monday papers carry President Bush\'s earthquake message to </p><p>Turkey, in which the President offered American nation\'s </p><p>condolences and stressed that U.S. was ready to help Turkey </p><p>by all means. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Iraq: Sunday\'s "Hurriyet" says in a front-page commentary </p><p>that Secretary Rumsfeld, after his thank-you visit to Gulf </p><p>countries, changed planes at the Incirlik Air Base before </p><p>proceeding to London.  Hurriyet notes that Rumsfeld, still </p><p>angry with Ankara for parliamentary rejection of the March 1 </p><p>permission to deploy US ground troops in Turkey, has </p><p>refrained from meeting with the Turkish officials.  The </p><p>commentary sees serious trouble in U.S., Turkey relations, </p><p>and emphasizes that the State Department was trying to </p><p>balance the `emotional\' reaction of the DOD.  A Monday op-ed </p><p>in "Hurriyet" hopes that Washington will not start a `blood </p><p>feud\' over Ankara\'s refusal to open the Northern Front.  It </p><p>also advises Turkey to implement `pragmatic policies\' after </p><p>the war, as has been seen in the changing attitude of </p><p>France.  Foreign Minister Gul said to "Sabah" on the Greek </p><p>island of Rhodes on Sunday that Secretary Rumsfeld had not </p><p>called him while in Incirlik.  `However, our contacts with </p><p>American officials continue,\' Gul noted.  Monday\'s </p><p>broadcasters report an ongoing debate between the `hawkish\' </p><p>Pentagon and `moderate\' State Department regarding whether </p><p>Turkish companies should be given a share from Iraq\'s </p><p>rebuilding.  Sunday papers say Secretary Powell has softened </p><p>his tone during his Syria visit, but urged President Assad </p><p>to close the offices of fundamentalist, anti-Israeli terror </p><p>groups in Damascus. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Washington conference for rebuilding Iraq: 34 Turkish </p><p>companies will participate in the strategic May 5 Washington </p><p>meetings for the reconstruction of Iraq, weekend papers </p><p>report.  Turkey\'s Union of Chambers (TOBB) and many </p><p>construction firms are to join the meetings.  Local media </p><p>reports that Turkish companies have technical equipment and </p><p>price advantages in the international attempt for grabbing a </p><p>share in Iraq\'s rebuilding. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EU foreign ministers\' Rhodes meeting: EU foreign ministers, </p><p>among them the Turkish and Greek Cypriot ministers Gul and </p><p>Yakovu, came together in the Greek island of Rhodes over the </p><p>weekend.  Papers quote Gul voicing hope after the meetings </p><p>that the EU accession talks with Turkey could be given a </p><p>start in 2004.  Greek and Greek Cypriot foreign ministers </p><p>Papandreou and Yakou gave a warm welcome to Gul.  The group </p><p>made a boat tour to Turkey\'s coastal town of Kas on </p><p>Saturday, winning applause from residents.  Papandreou and </p><p>Gul said they had decided both states should simultaneously </p><p>present the UN with accords they had ratified banning </p><p>landmines on the border between the two countries, reports </p><p>note.  "Our common borders must be respected, but they must </p><p>be borders of peace and collaboration," Papandreou said. </p><p>Gul urged the removal of international sanctions on Turkish </p><p>Cypriots, and vowed for some new `openings\' by Ankara, among </p><p>them recognition of the Greek Cypriot state, Sunday papers </p><p>report.  Papers hail the EU foreign ministers\' `goodwill </p><p>gesture\' of coming to Kas, giving a message just before the </p><p>tourism season that Turkey was a safe country. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>a) Middle East </p><p>b) US-Turkey-Syria </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The Roadmap" </p><p>Soli Ozel wrote in mass appeal Sabah (5/4): "The roadmap did </p><p>not receive opposition from the Palestinian side, yet Israel </p><p>has already expressed reservations on 12 points and asked </p><p>for US facilitative help on this.  . It is also a known fact </p><p>that Ariel Sharon wants the possible Palestine state to only </p><p>have 42 percent of the occupied lands.  The litmus test for </p><p>the Middle East roadmap is whether or not the US is going to </p><p>put pressure on Israel.  In case President Bush ignores the </p><p>need for pressuring Israel on the eve of presidential </p><p>elections, violence will continue to be the destiny of the </p><p>region." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Ankara and Damascus" </p><p>Yasemin Congar opined from Washington in mass appeal </p><p>Milliyet (5/5): "Both the Ankara and Damascus visits by </p><p>Secretary Powell have something in common:  They resulted </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>from Powell\'s personal initiative and justification. </p><p>Powell made the decision personally as well as suddenly, and </p><p>he made all the efforts to persuade the administration of </p><p>the urgency of the visits.  Powell managed to convince the </p><p>White House, and thus the two visits took place.  However, </p><p>signs from the Pentagon tell us that the US Defense side is </p><p>not unhappy only about the Damascus visit, but the Ankara </p><p>visit as well.  . When Secretary Powell visited Ankara, it </p><p>was interpreted as a strong message to underline the US </p><p>position on northern Iraq and to underline the bilateral </p><p>ties with Turkey.  Yet the way the decision mechanism worked </p><p>on the visit indicates that the Bush administration is still </p><p>preserving a certain degree of disappointment.  Given that </p><p>fact, one can understand even better the reason for </p><p>Secretary Rumsfeld\'s avoiding contact with Ankara even </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>though he came to Incirlik airbase." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
