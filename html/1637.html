(U) CLASSIFIED BY POLITICAL COUNSELOR JAMES BRUNO; </p><p>REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) SUMMARY: VIETNAMESE PROTESTANT CHURCH SOURCES WITH </p><p>EXTENSIVE LINKS TO THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS INFORM US THAT </p><p>RESIDENTS OF GIA LAI PROVINCE, PARTICULARLY, FACE DIFFICULT </p><p>CONDITIONS, WITH HEAVY POLICE AND SECURITY PRESENCE </p><p>THROUGHOUT THE PROVINCE.  THEY SAID THEIR CHURCH CONTACTS </p><p>REPORT FOUR CHURCH MEMBERS MAY HAVE BEEN KILLED, AND AT </p><p>LEAST 20 HAVE BEEN ARRESTED FOR PARTICIPATING IN THE EARLY </p><p>FEBRUARY DEMONSTRATIONS.  THEY CONFIRM A CHURCH WAS </p><p>DESTROYED IN GIA LAI PROVINCE IN EARLY MARCH, BUT THEY ARE </p><p>NOT AWARE OF ALLEGATIONS THAT A DOZEN PEOPLE WERE KILLED IN </p><p>A RAID ON A CHURCH, AS ALLEGED BY REFUGEES IN CAMBODIA </p><p>(REF F).  SINCE EMBASSY AND CONGEN OFFICERS CONTINUE TO BE </p><p>PROHIBITED FROM TRAVELING TO THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS, </p><p>PROTESTANT CHURCH LEADERS WITH EXTENSIVE LINKS TO FELLOW </p><p>CHRISTIANS IN THE HIGHLANDS PROVIDE ONE OF THE FEW MEANS WE </p><p>HAVE OF LEARNING OF EVENTS THERE.  THOUGH BY NO MEANS </p><p>COMPREHENSIVE, THESE SOURCES HELP PROVIDE SOME PERSPECTIVE </p><p>ON THE WIDE-RANGING ALLEGATIONS CIRCULATING ABOUT EVENTS IN </p><p>THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>ATTACK ON CHURCH IN GIA LAI </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>                          SECRET </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00900  01 OF 06  170851Z </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) IN ORDER TO TRY TO OBTAIN CLARIFICATION AND/OR </p><p>CONFIRMATION OF THE CHARGES MADE BY MONTAGNARD REFUGEES WHO </p><p>HAVE FLED TO CAMBODIA (REFS E AND F), EMBASSY AND CONSULATE </p><p>HO CHI MINH CITY POLOFFS HAVE CHECKED WITH LONG-STANDING </p><p>CONTACTS IN THE VIETNAMESE PROTESTANT RELIGIOUS COMMUNITIES </p><p>WHO HAVE BEEN AMONG OUR MOST RELIABLE CONTACTS ON THE </p><p>HIGHLANDS IN THE PAST.  (THESE SOURCES INCLUDE LEADERS BOTH </p><p>OF THE "TIN LANH" EVANGELICAL CHURCH THAT WAS JUST </p><p>RECOGNIZED IN THE SOUTH AND THE UNDERGROUND HOUSE CHURCHES </p><p>THAT ARE UNRECOGNIZED.  LARGE NUMBERS OF PROTESTANT </p><p>CHRISTIANS IN THE HIGHLANDS TEND TO BELONG TO HOUSE </p><p>CHURCHES THAT HAVE A HISTORIC AFFILIATION WITH THE SOUTHERN </p><p>"TIN LANH" MOVEMENT.)  THE REPORTS WE HAVE RECEIVED FROM </p><p>THESE SOURCES ARE FRAGMENTARY BUT HELP PROVIDE SOME CONTEXT </p><p>TO REPORTS FROM OTHER SOURCES. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) THESE SOURCES CONFIRM, AS REPORTED REF E, THAT A </p><p>CHURCH IN GIA LAI PROVINCE WAS ATTACKED IN THE SECOND WEEK </p><p>OF MARCH, BUT THEIR ACCOUNTS DIFFER DRAMATICALLY FROM THOSE </p><p>REPEATED SECOND-HAND BY THE ETHNIC JARAI REFUGEES IN </p><p>CAMBODIA.  (ACCORDING TO REF F "UNCONFIRMED REPORTS, POLICE </p><p>KILLED 12, WOUNDED 60 AND ARRESTED 74 JARAI DURING THE RAID </p><p>ON THE CHURCH.") </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) ACCORDING TO A PROTESTANT CHURCH LEADER BASED IN HO </p><p>CHI MINH CITY WHO HAS EXTENSIVE LINKS AMONG HOUSE CHURCHES </p><p>IN THE HIGHLANDS THROUGH HIS "CHURCH-PLANTING MINISTRY" </p><p>NETWORK, SOLDIERS DEMOLISHED A CHURCH IN PHU NHON DISTRICT, </p><p>ABOUT 50 KILOMETERS SOUTH OF PLEIKU (CAPITAL OF GIA LAI </p><p>PROVINCE) MARCH 10.  THE STORY TRACKS IN SOME WAYS WITH REF </p><p>                          SECRET </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  00900  01 OF 06  170851Z </p><p>F ACCOUNT: POLICE TRIED TO ARREST A PASTOR THERE, AND LARGE </p><p>NUMBERS OF VILLAGERS (PERHAPS MORE THAN 100) CLASHED WITH </p><p>POLICE AND SOLDIERS TO PREVENT THIS.  TEAR GAS WAS USED TO </p><p>DISPERSE THE CROWD, AND THE POLICE USED ELECTRIC PRODS. </p><p>ACCORDING TO TWO SOURCES WE HAVE CHECKED WHO HAVE HEARD </p><p>ACCOUNTS OF THIS EVENT FROM THEIR CONTACTS IN GIA LAI, NO </p><p>ONE WAS KILLED IN THIS INCIDENT, THOUGH MANY VILLAGERS WERE </p><p>INJURED, AND "A NUMBER" OF PERSONS WERE DETAINED.  AFTER </p><p>THE CLASH, POLICE TORE DOWN THE CHURCH.  (THE FIRST REPORT </p><p>OF A CHURCH ATTACK IN MARCH WAS MADE BY THE RESIDENT AP </p><p>CORRESPONDENT, WHO LEARNED OF IT DURING THE TRAVEL OF PRESS </p><p>GROUP TO THE HIGHLANDS.  SHE TOO DID NOT RECEIVE REPORTS OF </p><p>ANY KILLINGS AT THE CHURCH.) </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) OUR CHURCH CONTACTS ARE NOT AWARE OF AN ATTACK ON </p><p>CHURCHES IN PLEI LAO, XA NINH HOA, HUYEN CHU SE IN GIA LAI </p><p>PROVINCE, AS ALLEGED BY THE REFUGEES IN CAMBODIA TO UNHCR </p><p>(AS SUGGESTED BY THE REFUGEES IN CAMBODIA).  IT IS POSSIBLE </p><p>THERE WAS ANOTHER ATTACK ON A CHURCH MARCH 10, THOUGH WE </p><p>CANNOT CONFIRM THIS FROM OUR CONTACTS HERE. </p><p> </p><p>7. (S) COMMENT: ALTHOUGH OF COURSE OUR CONTACTS\' LACK OF </p><p>KNOWLEDGE OF ALLEGED DEATHS AT A CHURCH IN THE CENTRAL </p><p>HIGHLANDS DOES NOT PROVE OR DISPROVE THE CHARGES, THEIR </p><p>LACK OF KNOWLEDGE IS NOTABLE BECAUSE TWO OF THE CONTACTS WE </p><p>CHECKED WITH ARE OUR BEST SOURCES FOR DEVELOPMENTS IN </p><p>ETHNIC MINORITY REGIONS OF VIETNAM.  THESE TWO VIETNAMESE </p><p>PASTORS BOTH TRAVEL WIDELY AROUND THE COUNTRY AND HAVE BEEN </p><p>ARRESTED AND DETAINED SEVERAL TIMES.  ONE OF THEM HAS BEEN </p><p>INFORMED REPEATEDLY BY SECURITY OFFICIALS THAT HE IS </p><p>PROHIBITED FROM GETTING A PASSPORT AND THUS BANNED FROM </p><p>LEAVING THE COUNTRY.  THESE ARE THE SOURCES WHO "BROKE THE </p><p>STORIES" ABOUT THE ONGOING ARRESTS AND DETENTIONS OF HMONG </p><p>CHRISTIANS IN THE NORTHWEST OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS, AS </p><p>WELL AS THE CHURCH DEMOLITIONS IN BINH PHUOC PROVINCE A </p><p>YEAR AGO.  ONE OF THE TWO, AS WELL, WAS INFLUENTIAL IN </p><p>HELPING BRING TO LIGHT THE DOCUMENTS ON REPRESSION OF </p><p>PROTESTANTS THAT WERE PUBLISHED BY FREEDOM HOUSE LATE LAST </p><p>YEAR.  THUS, WHILE IT IS CERTAINLY POSSIBLE THEY ARE "OUT </p><p>OF THE LOOP" ON THIS CHARGE, IT GIVES US PAUSE THAT THEY </p><p>HAVE NOT HEARD OF DEATHS IN THE ALLEGED CHURCH INCIDENT. </p><p> </p><p>8. (S) COMMENT (CONT\'D): FURTHERMORE, AN ADDITIONAL FACTOR </p><p>THAT GIVES US PAUSE IS THAT MONTAGNARD SOURCES FROM </p><p>CAMBODIA AND SOUTH CAROLINA BOTH REPORT PRECISELY THE SAME </p><p>NUMBERS OF ETHNIC JARAI KILLED, WOUNDED AND ARRESTED, AS </p><p>CITED IN PARA 4 ABOVE.  A POSSIBLE EXPLANATION, OF COURSE, </p><p>IS THAT A PRIMARY SOURCE RELAYED AN ACCOUNT DIRECTLY BOTH </p><p>TO HIS CAMBODIAN COUNTERPARTS, AS SUGGESTED IN REF F, AND </p><p>TO CONTACTS IN SOUTH CAROLINA.  HOWEVER, NORMALLY IN AN </p><p>INCIDENT SUCH AS THE ONE DESCRIBED, WIDELY VARYING RUMORS </p><p>                          SECRET </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00900  02 OF 06  170851Z </p><p>CIRCULATE ABOUT THE NUMBERS OF THOSE AFFECTED.  IN THIS </p><p>CASE THERE ARE VIRTUALLY IDENTICAL REPORTS COMING FROM BOTH </p><p>CAMBODIA AND SOUTH CAROLINA, BUT WE ARE NOT HEARING SUCH </p><p>REPORTS FROM OUR CONTACTS INSIDE VIETNAM.  WE WILL KEEP </p><p>CHECKING ON THIS ISSUE, BUT FOR THE MOMENT WE BELIEVE THAT </p><p>WHILE WE CAN CORROBORATE THAT AT LEAST ONE CHURCH WAS </p><p>DESTROYED IN GIA LAI, WE MUST CONSIDER THE REPORTS OF </p><p>DEATHS AT A CHURCH AS UNCONFIRMED, UNLESS WE RECEIVE </p><p>CORROBORATING EVIDENCE.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>PORTRAIT OF PROTESTANT CHURCHES IN THE HIGHLANDS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) ONE PROMINENT PROTESTANT CHURCH LEADER IN HCMC WHO </p><p>HAS ACTIVE ONGOING LINKS TO HOUSE CHURCH LEADERS IN THE </p><p>CENTRAL HIGHLANDS TOLD POLOFF THAT PROTESTANT CHRISTIANS IN </p><p>THE HIGHLANDS PROVINCES OF GIA LAI AND DAKLAK HAVE LITTLE </p><p>ROOM TO OPERATE AT PRESENT.  MOST CHURCHES ARE STILL ABLE </p><p>TO FUNCTION, BUT THEY ARE WATCHED CLOSELY, AND POLICE AND </p><p>SECURITY FORCES ARE OUT IN FORCE, PARTICULARLY IN GIA LAI. </p><p>HE SAID THAT WHILE A FORMAL CURFEW DOES NOT EXIST, POLICE </p><p>GUARD VILLAGES CLOSELY IN GIA LAI, AND PERSONS ARE NOT ABLE </p><p>TO MOVE AROUND FREELY; THEY ARE REQUIRED TO REMAIN IN THEIR </p><p>HOME VILLAGES.  NORMALLY, HE SAYS, THERE IS LARGE-SCALE </p><p>MOVEMENT BACK AND FORTH ACROSS THE BORDER, SINCE THERE ARE </p><p>APPROXIMATELY 25,000 EDE AND JARAI MINORITY PERSONS WHO </p><p>LIVE IN CAMBODIA AND TRAVEL RELATIVELY FREELY OVER WHAT IS </p><p>NORMALLY A QUITE POROUS BORDER.  (NOTE: ANOTHER INDEPENDENT </p><p>SOURCE ALSO NOTED THERE IS GENERALLY FREE MOVEMENT ACROSS </p><p>THE BORDER.)  OUR SOURCE SAID HIS CHURCH CONTACTS IN GIA </p><p>LAI TELL HIM THAT AFTER THE FEBRUARY DEMONSTRATIONS, </p><p>                          SECRET </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  00900  02 OF 06  170851Z </p><p>PERSONS OF DIFFERENT ETHNIC MINORITY GROUPS WERE SEPARATED </p><p>SO THEY WOULD NOT MIX.  HE KNEW OF FOUR HIGHLANDS CHURCH </p><p>LEADERS IN GIA LAI WHO WEREARRESTED FOR HAVING </p><p>PARTICIPATED IN THE FEBRUARYDEMONSTRATIONS.  HE HAD HEARD </p><p>REPORTS OF LARGER UMBERS BUT COULD NOT VERIFY THESE. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) THE CMC-BASED PROTESTANT LEADER SAID THAT IN THE </p><p>HIGHANDS, MOST CHURCHES CONTINUE TO BE AFFILIATED WITHTHE </p><p>CHRISTIAN MISSIONARY ALLIANCE (CMA) NETWORK F "TIN LANH" </p><p>CHURCHES, THOUGH AT LEAST FIVE PASTRS IN GIA LAI INFORMED </p><p>THEIR CMA COLLEAGUES THEYWERE WITHDRAWING TO AFFILIATE </p><p>WITH A "DEGA" CHURC COMMITTED TO A SEPARATIST "DEGA" STATE </p><p>FOR ETHNC MINORITIES.  ACCORDING TO THIS SOURCE, ON </p><p>FEBRARY 2, AN ARMED GROUP OF FOUR JARAI ETHNIC MINORIT </p><p>MEMBERS CAME TO THE HOME OF KSOR BRAU, ONE OF TE TWO </p><p>MINORITY PASTORS ELECTED TO THE EXECUTIVE CUNCIL OF THE </p><p>RECENTLY RECOGNIZED CM CHURCH IN THE SOUTH, THREATENING TO </p><p>KILL HIM IF HE DID NOT AFFILIATE WITH THE SEPARATIST DEGA </p><p>MOVEMENT.  BRAU WAS NOT AT HOME, AND DID NOT RETURN FOR A </p><p>COUPLE DAYS.  HE HAS NOT BEEN THREATENED SUBSEQUENTLY, </p><p>ALTHOUGH THE HCMC PASTOR SAID THIS INCIDENT REVEALED DEEP </p><p>FISSURES AMONG MINORITIES IN THE AREA.  THE HCMC PASTOR </p><p>SAID HIS CONTACTS IN GIA LAI BELIEVE THESE FOUR PERSONS </p><p>WERE "LINKED" TO LEADERS OF A U.S.-BASED MONTAGNARD </p><p>ORGANIZATION, THOUGH THIS COULD NOT BE PROVEN.  (NOTE: THE </p><p>PASTOR WAS FAMILIAR WITH U.S.-BASED GROUPS THAT HAVE BEEN </p><p>DESCRIBED IN VITRIOLIC TERMS BY THE VIETNAMESE PRESS.)  THE </p><p>HCMC PASTOR SAID MANY PROTESTANTS WERE WORRIED THE </p><p>SEPARATIST/AUTONOMY AGENDA OF SOME MINORITIES WAS AND WOULD </p><p>CONTINUE TO PROVOKE A STRONG REACTION FROM THE GOVERNMENT. </p><p> </p><p>REPORTS ABOUT FEBRUARY DEMONSTRATIONS </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) SIMILARLY, AN EXPATRIATE LEADER LINKED WITH THE </p><p>WORLD EVANGELICAL FELLOWSHIP WHO REGULARLY VISITS VIETNAM </p><p>AND MEETS WITH HOUSE CHURCH LEADERS, INCLUDING SOME FROM </p><p>THE HIGHLANDS, TOLD POLOFF THAT THE NETWORK OF PROTESTANT </p><p>CHURCHES IN THE HIGHLANDS IS ONE OF THE FEW ELEMENTS OF </p><p>"CIVIL SOCIETY" PRESENT IN THE AREA.  THOUGH HIS CONTACTS </p><p>HAD TOLD HIM THE CHURCHES INSTITUTIONALLY WERE LARGELY </p><p>UNINVOLVED IN THE FEBRUARY DEMONSTRATIONS, SIGNIFICANT </p><p>NUMBERS OF INDIVIDUAL CHURCH MEMBERS AND SOME LEADERS </p><p>PARTICIPATED.  HE SAID HIS CHURCH CONTACTS IN THE HIGHLANDS </p><p>WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THE POTENTIAL FOR "RADICALIZATION" OF </p><p>THE MONTAGNARD CHURCHES BECAUSE OF THE EXTREME POVERTY IN </p><p>THE REGION, THE LOSS OF TRADITIONAL LANDS TO ETHNIC </p><p>VIETNAMESE AND OTHER SETTLERS, WIDESPREAD SOCIETAL </p><p>DISCRIMINATION AGAINST MINORITY PEOPLES, AND LONG-STANDING </p><p>FRUSTRATION WITH TREATMENT BY CENTRAL AUTHORITIES, </p><p>INCLUDING HARASSMENT OF CHURCHES. </p><p>                          SECRET </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00900  03 OF 06  170852Z </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) THIS EXPATRIATE SOURCE SAID HIS CONTACTS IN GIA LAI </p><p>HAD INFORMED HIM THAT THE FEBRUARY 2 DEMONSTRATION IN </p><p>PLEIKU HAD BEEN A "PITCHED BATTLE."  THE DEMONSTRATORS, </p><p>MANY OF THEM ARMED WITH KNIVES AND BAGS OF ROCKS, ATTEMPTED </p><p>TO DESTROY THE POST OFFICE, AND SOME DEMONSTRATORS AND </p><p>POLICE REPORTEDLY WERE SERIOUSLY INJURED.  HIS CONTACTS HAD </p><p>HEARD REPORTS OF FOUR DEMONSTRATORS KILLED IN THESE </p><p>DEMONSTRATIONS IN PLEIKU, BUT THEY COULD NOT CONFIRM THIS. </p><p>BY CONTRAST, HIS CONTACTS SAID BUON ME THUOT IN DAKLAK </p><p>PROVINCE NEVER TURNED SO VIOLENT. </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) THE EXPATRIATE SOURCE SAID HIS CONTACTS SAID AT </p><p>LEAST TWENTY MINORITY CHRISTIANS WHO HAD PARTICIPATED IN </p><p>THE DEMONSTRATIONS WERE PICKED UP SHORTLY AFTER.  HE SAID </p><p>THE POLICE HAD TAKEN EXTENSIVE VIDEOTAPE OF THE </p><p>DEMONSTRATIONS AND USED THIS TO IDENTIFY THE PARTICIPANTS. </p><p>HE SURMISED THIS WAS ONE OF THE FACTORS THAT HAD DRIVEN </p><p>SOME OF THOSE TO FLEE, SINCE THOSE INVOLVED IN THE </p><p>DEMONSTRATIONS CLEARLY FEARED THEY WOULD BE PICKED UP. </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) THIS EXPATRIATE SOURCE SAID ETHNIC MINORITY CHURCH </p><p>LEADERS WERE CAUGHT IN A DIFFICULT SPOT, SINCE THEY WANTED </p><p>TO BROADEN THEIR OWN SPACE TO OPERATE, BUT SOME FACED </p><p>PRESSURE TO EMBRACE A SEPARATIST AGENDA THAT WOULD CAUSE </p><p>THE AUTHORITIES TO CRACK DOWN.  HE RELAYED AN ACCOUNT OF </p><p>FEBRUARY 2 EVENTS IN THE BUON ME THUOT AREA OF DAKLAK </p><p>PROVINCE THAT TYPIFIED THIS DILEMMA.  ON THAT DATE, THREE </p><p>CHRISTIAN LEADERS WERE CALLED BY AUTHORITIES TO A MEETING </p><p>IN BUON ME THUOT AND THEN ASKED TO TRY TO SPEAK TO A CROWD </p><p>OF ABOUT 400 PROTESTERS.  AFTER MEETING WITH AUTHORITIES, </p><p>                          SECRET </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  00900  03 OF 06  170852Z </p><p>THE PASTORS ATTEMPTED TO SPEAK TO THE CROWD, MANY OF WHOM </p><p>WERE CHANTING SLOGANS ABOUT LAND GRIEVANCES, BUT THEY WERE </p><p>SHOUTED DOWN.  RECOGNIZING THE FUTILITY OF THE SITUATION, </p><p>THE PASTORS LEFT THE CITY TO RETURN TO THEIR HOMES. </p><p>SHORTLY THEREAFTER, HOWEVER, A RUMOR CIRCULATED IN BUON ME </p><p>THUOT THAT THE PASTORS HAD BEEN ABDUCTED. </p><p> </p><p>DANES CONTINUE TO WORK IN DAKLAK </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>15. (C) AN INTERESTING EXCEPTION TO THE PROHIBITION OF </p><p>WESTERN DIPLOMATIC ACCESS TO THE HIGHLANDS IS THAT AFFORDED </p><p>THE DANISH EMBASSY, WHICH HAS A HALF-DOZEN ADVISORS BASED </p><p>IN BUON ME THUOT WORKING ON AGRICULTURAL AND COMMUNITY </p><p>DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS.  A DANISH EMBASSY POLOFF (WHO SPENDS </p><p>HALF HER TIME ON AID QUESTIONS) VISITED DAKLAK APRIL 1-3 AS </p><p>PART OF A PREVIOUSLY SCHEDULED EVALUATION TRIP TO SEE </p><p>PROJECTS SHE SUPERVISES.  SHE MET WITH HER COUNTERPARTS </p><p>THERE, WHO PROVIDED READOUTS ON THE FEBRUARY 2 </p><p>DEMONSTRATIONS IN BUON ME THUOT, SAYING THERE WERE ROUGHLY </p><p>500 LARGELY RURAL ETHNIC MINORITY PROTESTERS WHO CAME INTO </p><p>TOWN FOR THE DEMONSTRATIONS.  POLICE SOON MOVED TO BLOCK </p><p>OFF THE STREETS ONCE THIS GROUP ASSEMBLED, PREVENTING </p><p>CURIOUS LOCAL RESIDENTS FROM BEING ABLE TO WITNESS THE </p><p>PROTESTS. </p><p> </p><p>16. (C) THE DIPLOMAT TOLD EMBOFF THAT, DURING HER TRIP, SHE </p><p>WAS ABLE TO HAVE ROUTINE MEETINGS WITH HER COUNTERPARTS, </p><p>SUCH AS THE DEPUTY HEAD OF THE PROVINCIAL PEOPLE\'S </p><p>COMMITTEE, BUT WHENEVER SHE ATTEMPTED TO RAISE QUESTIONS ON </p><p>OTHER SUBJECTS, SUCH AS THE FEBRUARY DEMONSTRATIONS, HER </p><p>INTERLOCUTORS QUICKLY CHANGED THE SUBJECT.  (COMMENT: </p><p>WHILE WE CERTAINLY WILL CONTINUE TO PRESS FOR ACCESS TO THE </p><p>HIGHLANDS, THE "POTEMKIN" NATURE OF THE DANES\' VISIT </p><p>UNDERSCORES HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO OBTAIN INFORMATION IN </p><p>THESE PROVINCES WHEN UNDER THE CLOSE WATCH OF PROVINCIAL </p><p>"HOSTS."  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>17. (C) THE DANISH DIPLOMAT SAID SHE WAS NOT ALLOWED TO </p><p>SCHEDULE A TRIP OUTSIDE OF BUON ME THUOT DURING HER VISIT </p><p>(IT WAS "TOO SHORT NOTICE" FOR LOCAL OFFICIALS, SHE WAS </p><p>TOLD).  SHE SAID ONE OF HER INTERLOCUTORS, THE VICE CHAIR </p><p>OF THE PROVINCIAL PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE, HAD JUST RETURNED </p><p>FROM A LONG-SCHEDULED TRIP IN EARLY MARCH TO DENMARK.  SHE </p><p>SAID SHE WAS SURPRISED HE HAD AGREED TO GO, BUT IT SEEMED </p><p>FROM HER VISIT HE WAS SECURE IN HIS POSITION, AND HE IS </p><p>WIDELY BELIEVED TO BE SOON PROMOTED TO CHAIR OF THE </p><p>PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE, WITH THE CURRENT CHAIR MOVING UP TO BE </p><p>HEAD OF THE PROVINCIAL COMMUNIST PARTY.  (COMMENT: LIKE THE </p><p>DANES, WE BELIEVE CERTAIN OFFICIALS WILL "TAKE THE FALL" </p><p>FOR EVENTS IN THE HIGHLANDS, AND OTHERS SUCH AS THIS DEPUTY </p><p>                          SECRET </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00900  04 OF 06  170852Z </p><p>CHAIRMAN, WHO ARE POLITICALLY "INSULATED" FROM THE FALLOUT </p><p>WILL BE PROMOTED TO FILL THEIR PLACES.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>18. (C) THE DANE SAID THAT SHE AND HER COLLEAGUES IN BUON </p><p>ME THUOT DO NOT SEE ANY SIGNS OF TENSION -- AND ONE WOULD </p><p>NOT NOTICE ANYTHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY IN THIS CITY.  SHE </p><p>SAID THERE WAS NO VISIBLE EXTRA POLICE PRESENCE OR "WANTED </p><p>POSTERS," AND SHE SAID HER COLLEAGUES RESIDENT THERE SAID </p><p>THE SITUATION HAD VERY QUICKLY RETURNED TO NORMAL </p><p>APPEARANCES SHORTLY AFTER THE EARLY FEBRUARY </p><p>DEMONSTRATIONS.  THAT SAID, SHE WAS NOT ABLE TO VISIT </p><p>OUTLYING REGIONS OF THE PROVINCE AND ADMITTED SHE COULD NOT </p><p>SPEAK TO CONDITIONS THERE. </p><p> </p><p>18. (C) ONE INTERESTING BIT OF LOCAL COLOR WAS PROVIDED BY </p><p>HER WITNESSING OF A HALF-HOUR TELEVISION PROGRAM ON </p><p>VIETNAMESE TELEVISION ABOUT THE FEBRUARY UNREST.  SITTING </p><p>IN A RESTAURANT JUST FIFTY METERS FROM "LIBERATION SQUARE" </p><p>IN BUON ME THUOT, WHICH IS MARKED BY THE TANK THAT </p><p>"LIBERATED" THE TOWN, SHE SAID THE LARGELY VIETNAMESE </p><p>DINNER CROWD WATCHED THE PROGRAM ON THE EVENING NEWS </p><p>INTENTLY.  WHEN THE VIETNAMESE TV JOURNALIST INTERVIEWED </p><p>ONE ETHNIC MINORITY PERSON WHO "CONFESSED" HE HAD ONLY </p><p>PARTICIPATED IN THE DEMONSTRATIONS BECAUSE HE WAS DRUNK AND </p><p>DIDN\'T KNOW WHAT HE WAS DOING, THE WHOLE RESTAURANT ERUPTED </p><p>INTO DISBELIEVING LAUGHTER, WITH PATRONS JOKING "THEN IT </p><p>WAS ONLY AN ACCIDENT."  THE TV PROGRAM SHOWED VIDEO FOOTAGE </p><p>OF THE FEBRUARY DEMONSTRATIONS, INCLUDING ONE SCENE </p><p>(DESCRIBED ABOVE) OF A MINISTER SPEAKING TO A CROWD, URGING </p><p>THEM TO DISPERSE.  THE PROGRAM (WHICH RAN AT LEAST TWICE ON </p><p>NATIONAL NEWS PROGRAMS) ALSO INCLUDED AN INTERVIEW </p><p>                          SECRET </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  00900  04 OF 06  170852Z </p><p>ALLEGEDLY WITH THE HALF-BROTHER OF A PROMINENT MONTAGNARD </p><p>LEADER (BASED IN SOUTH CAROLINA) WHO IS RECORDED AS SAYING </p><p>THAT HIS HALF-BROTHER HAD CALLED HIM FROM THE U.S. AND </p><p>URGED THAT HE HELP ORGANIZE DEMONSTRATIONS, BUT HE HAD </p><p>REFUSED.  IN ADDITION, THE PROGRAM MADE FAMILIAR </p><p>ALLEGATIONS (WHICH WE HAVE SEEN IN PRINT ELSEWHERE) THAT </p><p>THE FULRO NETWORK OF FORMER GUERRILLAS IN THE HIGHLANDS </p><p>HELPED ORGANIZE THE RECENT DEMONSTRATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>19. (C) SHE ALSO NOTED THE VIETNAMESE AUTHORITIES HAD BUSED </p><p>IN HUNDREDS OF ETHNIC MINORITY PERSONS FOR A "LIBERATION </p><p>DAY" CELEBRATION IN THE TOWN, AND SHE WITNESSED SCENES OF </p><p>WRANGLING AND MISCOMMUNICATION AT THE HOTEL DESK BECAUSE </p><p>VIRTUALLY NONE OF THE MINORITIES SPOKE VIETNAMESE OR </p><p>APPEARED TO HAVE STAYED IN SUCH A HOTEL (A RELATIVELY NICE </p><p>STATE-RUN FACILITY) BEFORE.  SHE COMMENTED THAT THIS </p><p>REVEALED A BIT OF THE STAGED "POTEMKIN VILLAGE" ASPECT TO </p><p>VIETNAMESE COMMEMORATIONS IN THE TOWN. </p><p> </p><p>OFFICIAL PRESS\' VIRULENT REACTIONS TO HIGHLANDS EVENTS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p>20. (C) SINCE THE DEMONSTRATIONS BROKE OUT IN THE CENTRAL </p><p>HIGHLANDS IN LATE JANUARY-EARLY FEBRUARY, THE VIETNAMESE </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S REACTION HAS BEEN ALMOST REFLEXIVELY VITRIOLIC </p><p>AGAINST THE U.S. AND ITS ALLEGED SUPPORT FOR U.S.-BASED </p><p>MONTAGNARD GROUPS IN "FOMENTING THE UNREST."  VIETNAM HAS </p><p>BEEN ADAMANT IN REFUSING OUR REPEATED REQUESTS TO VISIT THE </p><p>REGION, AND THE STATE-CONTROLLED PRESS HAS SPEWED FORTH </p><p>DIATRIBE AFTER DIATRIBE.  (THE GVN ALSO HAS REFUSED ACCESS </p><p>TO OTHER NON-U.S. DIPLOMATS WHO DO NOT DEAL WITH ONGOING </p><p>AID PROJECTS IN THE AREA.) </p><p> </p><p>21. (SBU) MANY OF THE STATE-RUN MEDIA ACCOUNTS HAVE BEEN </p><p>HARSH EDITORIALS ALLEGING U.S. INVOLVEMENT IN THE </p><p>HIGHLANDS, THOUGH A FEW HAVE PROVIDED SOME INTERESTING </p><p>INSIGHTS INTO DEVELOPMENTS THERE.  FOR EXAMPLE, THE "LABOR" </p><p>TRADE UNION DAILY REPORTED MARCH 27 THAT THE BREWING </p><p>TROUBLES IN THE HIGHLANDS EXTEND BACK SEVERAL MONTHS, </p><p>CLAIMING THAT "HUNDREDS" OF YOUNG ETHNIC MINORITY PEOPLE </p><p>HAD SET UP A NO-GO ZONE NEAR PLEIKU LAST OCTOBER. </p><p>VILLAGERS IN CHUSE DISTRICT SOUTH OF PLEIKU WERE REPORTEDLY </p><p>PRESSURED BY THREE ALLEGED RINGLEADERS OF THE </p><p>DEMONSTRATIONS TO "ACT AS A HUMAN SHIELD" IN PREVENTING </p><p>OFFICIALS INTO THE AREA IN EARLY FEBRUARY.  THE PAPER </p><p>ALLEGED THE THREE -- SIU PUOH, SIU THUC AND KPA THAP -- </p><p>WERE ARRESTED MARCH 10 IN THE VILLAGE OF PLEI LAO IN GIA </p><p>LAI AS THEY CONTINUED TO "INCITE VILLAGERS TO PROVOKE </p><p>EXTREMELY SERIOUS DISTURBANCES."  (NOTE: THIS WAS THE FIRST </p><p>GVN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT WE ARE AWARE OF THAT THE UNREST </p><p>CONTINUED INTO MARCH.  END NOTE.) </p><p>                          SECRET </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00900  05 OF 06  170852Z </p><p> </p><p>22. (C) ADDITIONALLY, ON APRIL 10 VIETNAMESE MEDIA REPORTED </p><p>THAT SEVEN YOUNG PEOPLE, ALLEGEDLY MOSTLY "TEENAGE </p><p>DROPOUTS," WERE DETAINED IN DAKLAK PROVINCE REPORTEDLY FOR </p><p>USING "POISON GAS" AND OTHER CHEMICALS TO POISON HUNDREDS </p><p>OF SCHOOLCHILDREN.  THE "PEOPLE\'S ARMY" PAPER CLAIMED "THE </p><p>POISONING CASES WERE ACTS OF ORGANIZED CRIMINALS AIMED AT </p><p>CAUSING INSTABILITY, SABOTAGE AND CONFUSION AMONG PEOPLE." </p><p>NEWS ACCOUNTS OF THE PAST TWO WEEKS HAVE REPORTED THAT SOME </p><p>500 PERSONS, MOSTLY SCHOOL CHILDREN AND TEACHERS, HAVE </p><p>FALLEN SICK SINCE FEBRUARY WITH SEVERE STOMACH AND HEAD </p><p>PAINS AFTER SUSPECTED CHEMICAL POISONING AT SCHOOLS IN SIX </p><p>DISTRICTS OF DAKLAK.  (SUBSEQUENTLY OTHER VIETNAMESE MEDIA </p><p>ACCOUNTS HAVE SUGGESTED THE SICKNESSES MAY BE FROM BACTERIA </p><p>IN THE WATER SUPPLY.)  INTERESTINGLY, THE "POISONING" STORY </p><p>FIRST CIRCULATED ABOUT TWO MONTHS AGO FROM EXPATRIATE </p><p>MONTAGNARD SOURCES WHO ALLEGED CHEMICAL POISONING OF SCHOOL </p><p>CHILDREN BY THE VIETNAMESE AUTHORITIES.  (COMMENT: IT IS </p><p>HARD FOR US TO COME UP WITH A CREDIBLE MOTIVATION WHY </p><p>VIETNAMESE AUTHORITIES WOULD SO SUCH A THING.  END </p><p>COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT: PUTTING THE HIGHLANDS EVENTS IN CONTEXT </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>23. (C) COMMENT: THERE IS NO DISPUTING THAT VIETNAMESE </p><p>POLICE AND SECURITY FORCES HAVE MOVED INTO THE HIGHLANDS </p><p>WITH A HEAVY HAND, AND MULTIPLE SOURCES CONFIRM THAT LARGE, </p><p>UNDETERMINED NUMBERS OF ETHNIC MINORITY PERSONS HAVE BEEN </p><p>ARRESTED AND DETAINED, ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO PARTICIPATED IN </p><p>THE SOMETIMES-VIOLENT DEMONSTRATIONS IN GIA LAI.  THOUGH </p><p>                          SECRET </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  00900  05 OF 06  170852Z </p><p>OUR INFORMATION IS INCOMPLETE, IT CERTAINLY APPEARS AT </p><p>LEAST SOME, AND PERHAPS LARGE NUMBERS, OF THOSE ARRESTED </p><p>WERE PEACEFULLY PROTESTING DISCRIMINATORY TREATMENT BY THE </p><p>AUTHORITIES, INCLUDING DEMANDING RETURN OF TRADITIONAL </p><p>LANDS TO MINORITIES. </p><p> </p><p>24. (C) COMMENT (CONT\'D): IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES, WE BELIEVE </p><p>IT WAS REASONABLE FOR UNHCR IN CAMBODIA TO ASSUME THE </p><p>GROUPS OF ALLEGED LEADERS OF THESE DEMONSTRATIONS HAD WELL- </p><p>FOUNDED FEARS OF ACTION BY THE AUTHORITIES IF THEY RETURNED </p><p>TO VIETNAM AT THIS TIME.  GIVEN THEIR APPARENT FULRO </p><p>CONNECTIONS AND ROLE IN ORGANIZING THE DEMONSTRATIONS IN </p><p>EARLY FEBRUARY, THESE PERSONS REASONABLY ASSUME THEY WOULD </p><p>BE DETAINED OR ARRESTED IF THEY WOULD RETURN.  WE WOULD </p><p>NOTE THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THERE MAY BE SUBSEQUENT "WAVES" </p><p>OF ASYLUM-SEEKERS FLEEING TO CAMBODIA IN ORDER TO ALSO SEEK </p><p>REFUGEE STATUS.  GIVEN THE POTENTIAL FOR A "PUSH-PULL" </p><p>PHENOMENON THAT COULD ENCOURAGE SUBSEQUENT GROUPS TO </p><p>TRAVEL, WE THINK IT ADVISABLE TO LOOK VERY CAREFULLY AT ANY </p><p>SUBSEQUENT ACCOUNTS TO ENSURE OTHERS ARE GENUINE REFUGEES. </p><p>(SEPTEL WILL DISCUSS THIS ISSUE FURTHER.) </p><p> </p><p>25. (S) COMMENT (CONT\'D): CONCERNING SOME OF THE CHARGES </p><p>MADE BY VARIOUS EXPATRIATE MONTAGNARD GROUPS, WE CAUTION </p><p>THAT WE NEED TO LOOK CAREFULLY AT EACH CHARGE ON ITS OWN </p><p>MERITS.  IN READING ACCOUNTS OF ONE GROUP\'S PROLIFIC </p><p>LITERATURE OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS, WE HAVE NOTED THAT SOME </p><p>CHARGES ARE VERIFIABLY TRUE, WHILE OTHERS SEEM EXAGGERATED. </p><p>GIVEN THAT EMBASSY AND CONGEN OFFICERS ARE UNABLE TO TRAVEL </p><p>TO THE AREA AND CHECK OUT THESE REPORTS, IT IS EXCEEDINGLY </p><p>DIFFICULT FOR US TO SEPARATE VERIFIABLE FACTS OF POLICE </p><p>HEAVY-HANDEDNESS FROM UNCONFIRMED REPORTS OF MASS KILLINGS. </p><p>AT THIS TIME, WE CANNOT MAKE DEFINITIVE JUDGMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>26. (S) COMMENT (CONT\'D): WE WOULD CAUTION THAT CERTAIN </p><p>CHARGES SEEM EXTRAORDINARY.  ACCORDING TO AN APRIL 6 </p><p>REUTERS ACCOUNT, A PROMINENT U.S.-BASED MONTAGNARD LEADER </p><p>WAS QUOTED APRIL 6 IN GENEVA AS URGING THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>COMMUNITY TO "PUT AN END TO THE LAST 26 YEARS OF GENOCIDAL </p><p>PRACTICES" BY THE VIETNAMESE IN THE HIGHLANDS.  HE WENT ON </p><p>TO SAY THAT THREE ETHNIC MINORITY PERSONS SURVIVED GVN </p><p>ATTEMPTS TO CRUCIFY THEM IN DECEMBER, AND ALLEGED ANOTHER </p><p>MINORITY PERSON WAS TORTURED TO DEATH BY ELECTRIC CATTLE </p><p>PRODS IN MARCH.  THIS IS THE FIRST WE HAVE EVER HEARD OF A </p><p>SUPPOSED ATTEMPTED CRUCIFIXION, AND THIS CHARGE -- LIKE </p><p>OTHERS CIRCULATED BY THIS GROUP ABOUT SUPPOSED GVN </p><p>POISONING OF SCHOOL CHILDREN IN DAKLAK AND ATTEMPTS TO </p><p>FORCIBLY STERILIZE MINORITY PEOPLE AS PART OF A "GENOCIDAL" </p><p>CAMPAIGN -- SEEMS HARD TO BELIEVE, GIVEN WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT </p><p>THE NATURE OF THE SOMETIMES HEAVY-HANDED VIETNAMESE </p><p>AUTHORITIES.  THIS IS NOT TO DOWNPLAY THE MUCH MORE </p><p>                          SECRET </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00900  06 OF 06  170853Z </p><p>CREDIBLE REPORTS WE HAVE RECEIVED FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES </p><p>ABOUT HARSH TREATMENT BY POLICE AND SECURITY OFFICIALS. </p><p>HOWEVER, AS OUR MAIN EXPATRIATE SOURCE FROM THE WORLD </p><p>EVANGELICAL FELLOWSHIP (ONE OF OUR MOST RESPECTED AND </p><p>PLUGGED-IN SOURCES ON HUMAN RIGHTS DEVELOPMENTS HERE) SAID </p><p>DURING OUR LAST MEETING WITH HIM: "EXTRALEGAL ABDUCTIONS </p><p>AND BEATINGS ARE BAD ENOUGH, BUT SOME OF THE OTHER CHARGES </p><p>ARE UNSUBSTANTIATED."  OUR ASSESSMENT FOR THE MOMENT IS </p><p>THAT WE HAVE NOT SEEN SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO CONFIRM THE </p><p>MORE EXTREME CHARGES. </p><p> </p><p>27. (C) COMMENT (CONT\'D): AS OUR EMBASSY, THE DEPARTMENT </p><p>AND EMBASSY PHNOM PENH CONTINUE TO DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE </p><p>OVER THE NEXT WEEKS, WE BELIEVE WE NEED TO KEEP IN MIND THE </p><p>FOLLOWING POINTS.  NONVIOLENT PROTEST AS A FORM OF </p><p>POLITICAL EXPRESSION IS AN INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNIZED RIGHT </p><p>THAT WE AFFIRM AND DEFEND.  UNDOUBTEDLY SOME OF THOSE IN </p><p>THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS WERE VOICING LEGITIMATE GRIEVANCES </p><p>NONVIOLENTLY.  HOWEVER, WE CANNOT SUPPORT THE USE OF </p><p>VIOLENCE IN SUCH PROTEST.  IN THE CURRENT SITUATION IN THE </p><p>CENTRAL HIGHLANDS, IT IS NEITHER RIGHT NOR EFFECTIVE; IN </p><p>FACT, IT IS HIGHLY COUNTERPRODUCTIVE AND THREATENS TO </p><p>PROVOKE TOUGHER SECURITY MEASURES IN THE AREA.  FOR THE </p><p>SAME REASONS, WE ALSO MUST REITERATE -- TO ALL SIDES IN </p><p>THIS ISSUE -- OUR OPPOSITION TO SECESSIONIST ATTEMPTS IN </p><p>THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS.  THE GVN\'S HISTORICAL NERVOUSNESS </p><p>ABOUT SECESSION IN THIS AREA IS WELL-FOUNDED, AND AS A </p><p>PRACTICAL MATTER, SUCH ATTEMPTS ARE IMPRACTICAL AND </p><p>UNWORKABLE.  WE BELIEVE WE NEED TO REITERATE PUBLICLY AND </p><p>PRIVATELY THAT WHILE NONVIOLENT PROTEST IS AN </p><p>INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNIZED RIGHT, VIOLENT AND SECESSIONIST </p><p>                          SECRET </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  00900  06 OF 06  170853Z </p><p>ACTIONS ARE NOT ACCEPTABLE.  END COMMENT. </p><p>PETERSON </p><p> </p><p>                          SECRET </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
