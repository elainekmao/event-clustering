U.S. </p><p>Ambassador to Ankara Robert Pearson, who made a `surprise\' </p><p>call on Prime Minister Gul on Tuesday, conveyed messages of </p><p>hope from President Bush to the Turkish government.  Gul </p><p>complained to Pearson about insufficient U.S. support, and </p><p>demanded a clear response from Washington about the status </p><p>of the Turkomen in a post-war Iraq. Ambassador Pearson said </p><p>there would be no aid without the approval of U.S. troops, </p><p>but added he was hopeful for a second decision.  Erdogan\'s </p><p>advisor Cuneyd Zapsu has told American papers that Erdogan </p><p>has to strengthen his position in order to convince </p><p>lawmakers, and stressed the necessity for new U.S. offers to </p><p>Turkey.  All papers expect the motion to be discussed by the </p><p>parliament in mid-March, after the Siirt by-election on </p><p>March 9.  Reports see it as possible that the U.S. and </p><p>Turkey might work out a new deal with slight changes in the </p><p>amount of economic aid and terms of debt repayment. </p><p>Comments highlight the fact that after the parliamentary </p><p>refusal, the U.S. has started voicing objection to a Turkish </p><p>military presence in northern Iraq, and refer to U/S of </p><p>State Grossman\'s warning to Turkey to refrain from </p><p>unilateral military action in northern Iraq.  "Radikal" </p><p>columnist Murat Yetkin talks about how some in the Turkish </p><p>Foreign Ministry felt uneasy about Grossman\'s remarks, which </p><p>were interpreted as threatening.  Yetkin also points to </p><p>Grossman\'s `evasiveness\' when asked by a journalist on </p><p>February 23 whether the US would side with the Turks or the </p><p>Kurds in the event a choice becomes necessary.  Grossman\'s </p><p>response reportedly had a negative impact in the minds of </p><p>some parliamentarians.  "Milliyet" believes that Turkey\'s </p><p>military is nervous that it may not be able to thwart a new </p><p>Kurdish state in Iraq after a war in the absence of an </p><p>agreement with the U.S. An Iraqi Kurdish official says that </p><p>the U.S. has armed Kurdish military units with Stinger </p><p>missiles and heavy weapons in advance of the war on Baghdad, </p><p>according to "Cumhuriyet." `This is absolutely a </p><p>provocation,\' Foreign Minister Yakis said, criticizing Iraqi </p><p>Kurds who burned Turkish flags during demonstrations in </p><p>northern Iraq on Monday. </p><p>Cyprus: Turkish Cypriot leader Denktas arrived in Ankara on </p><p>Tuesday for talks on a UN request to hold a public </p><p>referendum on March 30 on the revised Annan peace plan to </p><p>unite the divided island.  Dailies predict tough days for </p><p>Denktas as political parties in the Turkish Cypriot sector </p><p>as well as the AKP have given a green light to the UN offer. </p><p>The EU has told Turkey that full membership in the Union </p><p>will be difficult without a solution on Cyprus.  `It will be </p><p>much more difficult for the EU to begin accession </p><p>negotiations with Turkey after May next year, when the Greek </p><p>Cypriot side, which is not recognized by Turkey, becomes a </p><p>full member of the EU,\' said EU enlargement commissioner </p><p>Verheugen. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION: Iraq/US-Turkey </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Turkish military is uneasy" </p><p>Hasan Cemal analyzed in mass appeal Milliyet (3/5): "The </p><p>Turkish military is disturbed by the fact that the </p><p>authorization decree (to permit deployment of American </p><p>troops in Turkey and Turkish troops in Northern Iraq) was </p><p>rejected by the parliament.  The military wants to be in </p><p>northern Iraq to protect Turkey\'s national security </p><p>interests.  With the decree rejected, the Turkish military </p><p>presence in northern Iraq has lost its legitimacy. . </p><p>Interestingly enough, we keep receiving negative indications </p><p>about the Turkish army\'s intervention in northern Iraq. </p><p>Marc Grossman, for instance, emphasized two points as </p><p>Washington\'s view: Turkey should not act unilaterally in </p><p>northern Iraq; and Turkey is about to lose its chance to </p><p>participate in the Iraq process. . Along with the recent </p><p>anti-Turkish demonstrations in the region, we should be able </p><p>to read Washington\'s message as follows: `In the absence of </p><p>Turkish permission for a US northern front, the US will not </p><p>be helpful to Turkey on northern Iraq.\' . Due to these </p><p>developments, the Washington-Ankara line for a second </p><p>attempt for a parliamentary decision is underway.  AKP </p><p>leader Erdogan\'s latest remark to the party members, that </p><p>`we cannot afford to sit and watch development\' is no </p><p>coincidence." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Bargaining continues" </p><p>Zeynep Gurcanli wrote in tabloid Star (3/5): "It is very </p><p>realistic to believe that the AKP government is preparing to </p><p>sit at the table with the US again, but it will be under </p><p>Erdogan\'s premiership.  It is also not a coincidence that </p><p>the government imposed additional taxes immediately after </p><p>the permission was declined by the parliament. . Most </p><p>likely, the second decree will be presented to the </p><p>parliament and with the help of Erdogan\'s pressure upon the </p><p>AKP deputies, and it will be accepted with a large majority. </p><p>This will also serve Erdogan in his efforts to reclaim his </p><p>leadership position.  In sum,  sooner or later we will see </p><p>the American soldiers on Turkish soil." </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
