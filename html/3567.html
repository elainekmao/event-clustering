<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 002506 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/23/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PREL, SOCI, NI </p><p>SUBJECT:  NIGERIA: LOCAL SHARI\'A COURT DENIES APPEAL OF </p><p>ADULTERY CONVICTION OF AMINA LAWAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA 00038 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter; Reasons 1.5 (B) and </p><p>(D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: The upper Shari\'a court in Fantua, Katsina </p><p>State August 19 denied the appeal of Amina Lawal, convicted </p><p>of adultery and sentenced to death by stoning.  Poloffs twice </p><p>met Lawal\'s chief attorney Hauwa Ibrahim (strictly protect), </p><p>once prior to the appellate decision and immediately after </p><p>the appeal was denied. Ibrahim said that she presented a case </p><p>grounded in both Shari\'a and constitutional law.  Ibrahim </p><p>believed that under both Shari\'a and secular law her </p><p>arguments were sufficient to win acquittal, but the judge, </p><p>bowing to local pressure and community sentiment, disregarded </p><p>the law in order to satisfy spectators in the crowded </p><p>courtroom.  Ibrahim recalled the judge proclaiming in his </p><p>decision that the constitution was inferior to Shari\'a law. </p><p>The decision was greeted by loud cheers and jubilation. </p><p>Ibrahim has swiftly appealed to the Shari\'a Appeals Court in </p><p>Katsina.  If unsuccessful there, the case next moves to the </p><p>Federal Court of Appeals, then the Supreme Court.  The issue </p><p>of whether harsh Shari\'a punishments abridge the </p><p>constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual </p><p>punishment will take center stage should the case reach the </p><p>federal appellate panels.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) On August 16, Hauwa Ibrahim updated Poloffs on Amina </p><p>Lawal\'s case. Also present were Ms. Lawal and her baby. As </p><p>the first female attorney allowed to argue before a Nigerian </p><p>Shari\'a court, Ms. Ibrahim built a defense based on the facts </p><p>of the case, constitutional law, legal procedure, and </p><p>Shari\'a.  In her closing arguments, Ms. Hauwa Ibrahim </p><p>asserted that the Nigerian constitution guaranteed Ms. Lawal </p><p>the right to life.  She further argued that Ms. Lawal had </p><p>been denied her constitutional right to counsel, since she </p><p>had no legal representation at the original trial.  Her final </p><p>point was that the Shari\'a act as passed by the Katsina </p><p>legislature, guaranteed the case be heard by a panel of three </p><p>judges, but Ms. Lawal\'s case was heard by only one.  Ibrahim </p><p>also contended that Shari\'a could not be applied </p><p>retroactively, an argument used successfully in the Safiya </p><p>Husseini appeal. (Ref. A) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Earlier in the appeal proceedings, Ibrahim argued that </p><p>Ms. Lawal\'s initial confession of guilt was borne of a lack </p><p>of understanding of the charges of the law.  There is a clear </p><p>precedent that the accused is allowed to retract a </p><p>confession; the court, however, refused to accept this from </p><p>Ms. Lawal. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Ms. Ibrahim believed her case was strong but feared </p><p>that popular sentiment would compel the judge to deny the </p><p>appeal. Realizing that local political and social imperatives </p><p>might outweigh sound legal argument, Ms. Ibrahim had already </p><p>prepared the appeal for the Shari\'a Appeals Court. </p><p>Unfortunately, Ibrahim was prescient. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Poloffs met Ibrahim August 20, the day following the </p><p>court announcement.  Although she realized the chance of </p><p>victory was slim at the lower court, she still felt </p><p>emotionally deflated by the verdict.  The next avenue of </p><p>appeal is the Shari\'a Appeals Court. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) The atmosphere in the courtroom for the August 19 </p><p>decision was more akin to a political rally than a judicial </p><p>proceeding, according to Ibrahim.  The room was packed. </p><p>Students of local "Koranic" schools who are nothing more than </p><p>street beggars filled the room, murmuring religious quotes </p><p>and deriding defense counsel.  Many people appeared to have </p><p>been trooped in from other localities in order to augment the </p><p>hard line presence. The Shari\'a judge apparently decided to </p><p>play to the crowd, dismissing all arguments of the defense. </p><p>The judge asked the crowd whether he should apply man\'s law </p><p>or God\'s. Ibrahim lamented that this statement would not have </p><p>been so bad if the judge had correctly interpreted Islamic </p><p>law.  The judge dismissed out of hand the possibility that </p><p>Lawal did not understand the charges against her and </p><p>proclaimed her initial confession valid.  He stated that </p><p>Lawal\'s pregnancy was conclusive proof of adultery under </p><p>Maliki jurisprudence. However, Ibrahim pointed out, Maliki </p><p>thought accepts the "hidden embryo" theory where the </p><p>pregnancy of a formerly married woman could be attributed to </p><p>that union for a period of several years after the marriage </p><p>has ended.  He dismissed as irrelevant any argument that </p><p>conception occurred before implementation of Shari\'a in </p><p>Katsina.  Rather, the judge held that the constitution was </p><p>inferior to Shari\'a law.  The judge also rejected defense </p><p>arguments as nullities because there is no right of appeal </p><p>under Shari\'a.  Finally, the judge commended the police who </p><p>arrested Lawal.  Getting a cheer from the crowd, he decreed </p><p>that it was the duty of good Muslims to arrest anyone </p><p>violating Shari\'a law. </p><p>7. (C) Ibrahim felt the judge basically made a mockery of the </p><p>law and his judgement was played to the gallery and did not </p><p>address the legal points made by the defense.  For instance, </p><p>the judge completely sidestepped the issue of how he could </p><p>disregard the constitution and Katsina\'a Shari\'a penal code </p><p>passed by the State Assembly, when he owed his office to </p><p>these two laws. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Although it has been reported that the judge ordered </p><p>that the stoning be carried out after the baby is weaned--a </p><p>minimum of sixteen months from now--Ibrahim stated that the </p><p>Fatwa issued for the stoning was scheduled for September 20, </p><p>2003. She fears that vigilantes may attempt to implement the </p><p>sentence no matter what stage the appeal is in.  If the case </p><p>is allowed to run its course, there is ample time for a well </p><p>thought-out appeal, and time for the furor to die down. The </p><p>next step of appeal for Lawal is the Shari\'a Court of Appeal </p><p>in Katsina.  This is the same level at which Safiya Husseini </p><p>was acquitted in Sokoto State. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.(C) Ibrahim indentified three major issues which should be </p><p>resolved through the appeals process.  They are the supremacy </p><p>of the constitution as the law of the land, the conflict of </p><p>law between the Shari\'a penal codes, expanded Shari\'a law and </p><p>Shari\'a as derived from Islamic texts, and Nigeria\'s </p><p>obligations under international human right instruments to </p><p>which it has acceded. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Perhaps more than in Safiya Husseini\'s case, Amina </p><p>Lawal\'s may be a litmus test for Shari\'a in Nigeria. Should </p><p>the case reach the federal courts it may become the Nigerian </p><p>equivalent of the Scopes trial. If the case makes its way </p><p>into the Federal Appeals Court the constitutionality of </p><p>stringent Shari\'a penalties could be tested, and conceivably </p><p>declared unconstitutional. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) With each hearing in the appellate courts, the </p><p>chances for a reversal of Lawal\'s conviction improve.  Should </p><p>this case move swiftly there are political ramifications, </p><p>particularly in an election year.  Should the case be </p><p>reversed by the federal court, there will be an outcry from </p><p>ardent Muslims that the Federal government is impinging on </p><p>their religious freedom.  Although not involved in the </p><p>judicial process, Obasanjo will be blamed and condemned in </p><p>much of the North.  Should the case reach the Supreme Court </p><p>and that apex court uphold the conviction, Obasanjo faces a </p><p>Hobson\'s choice.  If he pardons Lawal, Obasanjo will lose </p><p>even more support in the Muslim North which is already </p><p>against him and religious tension will likely rise.  If he </p><p>does not grant a pardon, Lawal will be executed, some </p><p>Christians will accuse Obasanjo of bowing to electoral </p><p>pressure and Nigeria\'s image in the international community </p><p>will suffer greatly. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
