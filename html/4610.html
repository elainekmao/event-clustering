FOR EUR/WE (MENNUTI) </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINR, VT </p><p>SUBJECT:  HOLY SEE NOMINATES NEW DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER: </p><p>BIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION ON PIETRO PAROLIN </p><p> </p><p>1.   (U) POPE JOHN PAUL II HAS APPOINTED MONSIGNOR PIETRO </p><p>PAROLIN TO BE THE HOLY SEE\'S DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER (UNDER- </p><p>SECRETARY FOR THE SECTION FOR RELATIONS WITH STATES OF THE </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>SECRETARIAT OF STATE).  PAROLIN REPLACES ARCHBISHOP- </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>DESIGNATE CELESTINO MIGLIORE WHO HAS BEEN APPOINTED THE HOLY </p><p>SEE\'S PERMANENT OBSERVER AT THE U.N. IN NEW YORK. </p><p> </p><p>2.   (U) PIETRO PAROLIN WAS BORN IN SCHIAVON, IN VICENZA </p><p>PROVINCE, IN THE NORTH OF ITALY IN 1955.  AFTER HIS </p><p>ORDINATION AS A CATHOLIC PRIEST HE TOOK UP GRADUATE STUDIES </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  05848  041550Z </p><p>IN CANON LAW AND DIPLOMACY AND ENTERED THE HOLY SEE\'S </p><p>DIPLOMATIC SERVICE IN 1986.  PAROLIN SERVED AT HOLY SEE </p><p>NUNCIATURES IN NIGERIA AND MEXICO, AND MOST RECENTLY AS </p><p>DIRECTOR FOR SPAIN, ANDORRA, ITALY, SAN MARINO AND CONCORDAT </p><p>ISSUES AT THE VATICAN\'S FOREIGN MINISTRY.

(SBU) PAROLIN WAS A 2001 INTERNATIONAL VISITOR TO THE </p><p>UNITED STATES FROM THE VATICAN, AND HAS BEEN A GOOD CONTACT </p><p>FOR POST.  WE WORKED VERY CLOSELY WITH HIM IN HIS CAPACITY </p><p>AS COUNTRY DIRECTOR FOR INDONESIA DURING THE EAST TIMOR </p><p>CRISIS.  HE HAS CONSISTENTLY PROVEN HIMSELF AN OPEN-MINDED </p><p>"VATICANISTA" WHO HAS BEEN GROOMED FOR GREATER </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY IN THE HOLY SEE.  HE WOULD HAVE BEEN AN </p><p>OBVIOUS CHOICE FOR A PAPAL NUNCIO -- A COMMON ONWARD </p><p>ASSIGNMENT FOR VATICAN MFA COUNTRY DIRECTORS </p><p>-- BUT WE SUSPECT HIS SUPERIOR ABILITIES, AS WELL AS PERHAPS </p><p>FAMILY REASONS (WE KNOW HIS ELDERLY MOTHER\'S ILLNESS </p><p>SLIGHTLY ABBREVIATED HIS IV PROGRAM), HAVE KEPT HIM AT THE </p><p>VATICAN WHERE HE HAS NOW LEAP-FROGGED INTO A MORE SENIOR </p><p>POSITION.  PAROLIN WILL LIKELY CARRY ON THE TRADITION OF </p><p>FRIENDLINESS, OPERATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS, AND OPEN-MINDEDNESS </p><p>ESTABLISHED BY HIS PREDECESSOR, AND WILL BE AN EFFECTIVE </p><p>HIGH-LEVEL INTERLOCUTOR FOR THE U.S. </p><p> </p><p>NICHOLSON </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> </p><p></p><p> 2002VATICA05848 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
