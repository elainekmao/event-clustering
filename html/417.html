<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ADDIS ABABA 05620 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FOR S/CT BREELAND </p><p> </p><p>E.0.12356: DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS: PTER </p><p>SUBJ: ETHIOPIA: 1990 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 355397 </p><p> </p><p>1.  C-ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  THE FOLLOWING IS A RESPONSE TO PARA 5 OF REFTEL: </p><p> </p><p>A)  POST HAS NOT RECEIVED ANY INFORMATION REGARDING </p><p>GOVERNMENT PROSECUTIONS OF TERRORISTS.  IN MARCH, </p><p>1990, A BOMB BLAST AT THE HILTON HOTEL RESULTED IN </p><p>THE EXPULSION OF TWO LIBYAN DIPLOMATS.  THE </p><p>EXPULSION OCCURRED WITHIN 48 HOURS OF THE BLAST, AND </p><p>THE MISSION HAS NO INFORMATION REGARDING THE </p><p>INVESTIGATION LEADING TO THE GPDRE ACTION. </p><p> </p><p>B)  POST HAS NO RECORD OF THE GPDRE REQUESTING </p><p>EXTRADITION FOR SUSPECTED TERRORISTS. </p><p> </p><p>C)  IN TERMS OF PROSECUTION, POST CANNOT IMAGINE THE </p><p>GPDRE EXPERIENCING ANY IMPEDIMENTS;  IT WOULD LIKELY </p><p>BE SWIFT AND BRUTAL.  IN TERMS OF EXTRADITION, IT </p><p>WOULD LIKELY BE DEPENDENT UPON WHETHER THE GPDRE HAS </p><p>AN EXTRADITION TREATY WITH THE REQUESTING COUNTRY. </p><p>THERE IS CURRENTLY NO EXTRADITION TREATY WITH THE </p><p>U.S. </p><p> </p><p>D)  THE GPDRE HAS PROFESSED A DESIRE TO ASSIST IN </p><p>OTHER INTERNATIONAL MATTERS-I.E., NARCOTICS </p><p>TRAFFICKING - BUT HAS PROVIDED NO SPECIFICS ON </p><p>TERRORIST MATTERS.  THIS MAY BE A DELICATE SUBJECT </p><p>FOR THEM, AS THE PLO IS RECOGNIZED AND REPRESENTED </p><p>IN THIS COUNTRY. </p><p> </p><p>E)  POST IS NOT AWARE OF ANY MAJOR COUNTERTERRORIST </p><p>EFFORTS UNDERTAKEN BY THE GPDRE.  THEY HAVE MADE A </p><p>MAJOR EFFORT TO COUNTERACT EPLF AND TPLF ACTIVITY IN </p><p>ADDIS (AND THAT COUNTRYSIDE STILL UNDER GOVERNMENT </p><p>CONTROL), WHOM THEY REGARD AS TERRORISTS.  THE EPLF </p><p>AND TPLF ARE FAR TOO LARGE, STRONG, AND OCCUPY TOO </p><p>MUCH ETHIOPIAN TERRITORY TO BE CONSIDERED TERRORISTS. </p><p> </p><p>F)  POST HAS NOT DISCOVERED ANY ETHIOPIAN SUPPORT </p><p>FOR TERRORIST GROUPS OR INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM, </p><p>ASIDE FROM ETHIOPIAN RECOGNITION OF THE PLO.  THE </p><p>CURRENT GOVERNMENT ATTEMPTS AT RAPPROCHEMENT WITH </p><p>THE WEST HAS MEANT INCREASED SECURITY SURVEILLANCE </p><p>OF THE PLO, LIBYANS, AND IRAQIS. </p><p> </p><p>G)  POST HAS HEARD NOTHING FROM THE GPDRE THAT COULD </p><p>BE CONSIDERED AS SUPPORTING TERRORISM, OF AN ACTION </p><p>FROM THE "TERRORISM LIST" OF COUNTRIES.  IN FACT, </p><p>ETHIOPIA HAS COME OUT STRONGLY IN SUPPORT OF THE </p><p>U.N. POSITION CONDEMNING IRAQ FOR ITS INVASION OF </p><p>KUWAIT. </p><p> </p><p>H)  THE GPDRE HAS GIVEN THE APPEARANCE OF BEING </p><p>SUPPORTIVE OF COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS, THOUGH </p><p>EMBASSY EFFORTS TO SECURE A TERRORISM LIAISON FOR </p><p>THE RSO HAVE NOT YET BEEN FRUITFUL (THEY HAVE BEEN </p><p>ONGOING FOR SEVERAL MONTHS).  THIS INCREASED </p><p>COOPERATIVE SPIRIT IS A TREND SEEN OVER THE LAST 18 </p><p>MONTHS, AS THE GPDRE TURNS AWAY FROM COMMUNISM AND </p><p>BEGINS A TURN TOWARDS THE WEST. </p><p> </p><p>2.  IF S/CT REQUIRES ANY MORE DETAILED INFORMATION, </p><p>PLEASE DON\'T HESITATE TO ASK.  REGARDS. </p><p> </p><p>HOUDEK </p><p></p></div>
