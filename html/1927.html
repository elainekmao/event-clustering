THE VATICAN HAS WARNED THAT GLOBALIZATION AND </p><p>TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES THREATEN TO CREATE NEW FORMS OF </p><p>RACISM AGAINST SOCIETY\'S WEAKEST MEMBERS, INCLUDING </p><p>IMMIGRANTS, THE POOR AND THE UNBORN. THE COMMENTS CAME IN A </p><p>NEW EDITION OF "THE CHURCH AND RACISM," ISSUED BY THE </p><p>PONTIFICAL COUNCIL FOR JUSTICE AND PEACE. FIRST PUBLISHED IN </p><p>1988 AND REVISED AHEAD OF THE WCAR IN DURBAN, SOUTH AFRICA, </p><p>THE DOCUMENT INCLUDES THE ORIGINAL TEXT PLUS A NEW 15-PAGE </p><p>INTRODUCTION. THE NEW TEXT SIGNALED THE VATICAN\'S </p><p>DETERMINATION TO INCLUDE MIGRATION, POVERTY AND PRO-LIFE </p><p>ISSUES IN ITS GAME-PLAN AT THE DURBAN CONFERENCE. IT ALSO </p><p>CALLS FOR A MAJOR EDUCATION PROGRAM AGAINST RACISM AND </p><p>INTOLERANCE AND GIVES QUALIFIED SUPPORT FOR AFFIRMATIVE </p><p>ACTION PROGRAMS. THE VATICAN LINKS DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICES </p><p>TO ACCELERATING GLOBALIZATION WHICH HAS BROUGHT PROSPERITY </p><p>TO SOME BUT CREATED CULTURAL DISINTEGRATION FOR OTHERS. </p><p>ACCORDING TO THE VATICAN, THE RESULTING LACK OF IDENTITY </p><p>LEADS TO A REJECTION OR FEAR OF FOREIGNERS. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  04605  01 OF 02  041021Z </p><p>3.   THE VATICAN DOCUMENT INDIRECTLY TOUCHED ON FINANCIAL </p><p>COMPENSATION FOR DESCENDANTS OF SLAVES. IT SAID THAT FROM A </p><p>LEGAL POINT OF VIEW ALL PERSONS HAVE THE RIGHT TO EQUITABLE </p><p>REPARATION IF THEY HAVE PERSONALLY OR DIRECTLY SUFFERED </p><p>MATERIAL OR MORAL INJURY, AND THAT IDEALLY REPARATION SHOULD </p><p>ERASE ALL THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE INJUSTICE. WHEN THAT IS </p><p>NOT POSSIBLE, SOME FORM OF EQUIVALENT COMPENSATION SHOULD BE </p><p>MADE, BUT THE DOCUMENT ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THIS IS OFTEN </p><p>DIFFICULT TO CALCULATE. THE DOCUMENT SAID THE PRINCIPLE OF </p><p>REPARATION ALSO HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR RELATIONS BETWEEN </p><p>NATIONS, FOR EXAMPLE, "THE OBLIGATION OF GIVING SUBSTANTIAL </p><p>HELP TO DEVELOPING COUNTRIES." </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p>VATICAN WCAR DELEGATE: "NO ONE EQUATES ZIONISM WITH RACISM" </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.   THE VATICAN\'S HEAD OF DELEGATION AT THE WCAR IN DURBAN, </p><p>SOUTH AFRICA, ARCHBISHOP DIARMUID MARTIN, SAID AUGUST 28 </p><p>THAT NO ONE EQUATES ZIONISM WITH RACISM ANYMORE, IMPLYING </p><p>THE NOTION WAS AN ANACHRONISM. (NOTE: MARTIN IS THE </p><p>VATICAN\'S PERMANENT OBSERVER TO THE U.N. AGENCIES IN GENEVA. </p><p>END NOTE). IN AN INTERVIEW WITH VATICAN NEWS AGENCY "FIDES," </p><p>THE ARCHBISHOP SAID THE DURBAN CONFERENCE MAY TRY TO ADDRESS </p><p>THE QUESTION OF PALESTINIAN SUFFERING IN OTHER WAYS. THE </p><p>SECRETARY (NUMBER 2) AT THE PONTIFICAL COUNCIL FOR JUSTICE </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>AND PEACE, BISHOP GIAMPAOLO CREPALDI SAID AUGUST 30 THAT </p><p>POLEMICAL EXCHANGES SURROUNDING THE U.N. CONFERENCE SHOULD </p><p>NOT DISTRACT ATTENTION FROM THE FUNDAMENTAL NEED FOR BETTER </p><p>EDUCATION ON DIVERSITY.

THE VATICAN\'S TOP ECUMENICAL OFFICIAL, CARDINAL WALTER </p><p>KASPER, HAS LAMENTED THE BREAKUP OF A CATHOLIC-JEWISH </p><p>HISTORICAL COMMISSION STUDYING THE VATICAN\'S PUBLISHED WORLD </p><p>WAR II DOCUMENTS AND BLAMED IT PARTLY OF JEWISH MEMBERS\' </p><p>"LEAKS AND POLEMICAL WRITINGS." KASPER, PRESIDENT OF THE </p><p>VATICAN\'S COMMISSION FOR RELIGIOUS RELATIONS WITH JUDAISM, </p><p>SAID HE WOULD WORK TO RE-LAUNCH THE JOINT RESEARCH "ON NEW </p><p>FOUNDATIONS." HE SAID SUCH HISTORICAL RESEARCH DEPENDED ON </p><p>"CORRECTNESS," RESPECT AND RECIPROCAL TRUST AMONG THE </p><p>PROJECT\'S SCHOLARS. KASPER OPINED THAT THIS PRECONDITION HAD </p><p>BEEN COMPLETELY LOST BECAUSE OF THE "POLEMICS THAT AROSE </p><p>AFTER THE SUSPENSION OF THE RESEARCH WORK AND THE OFFENSIVE </p><p>SUSPICIONS THAT ACCOMPANIED THE SUSPENSION." THE CARDINAL </p><p>REAFFIRMED THE VATICAN\'S POSITION THAT ITS ARCHIVES RELATING </p><p>TO THE WORLD WAR II PERIOD WOULD BE OPEN TO SCHOLARS WHEN </p><p>THEY HAD BEEN CATALOGUED AND CLASSIFIED. HE ALSO ADMITTED </p><p>THAT REQUESTS FOR ACCESS BY JEWISH SCHOLARS ON THE DEFUNCT </p><p>COMMISSION WERE "UNDERSTANDABLE AND LEGITIMATE," AND THAT </p><p>HISTORICAL INVESTIGATION WAS NECESSARY IN PROMOTING JEWISH- </p><p> </p><p>NOTE: NOT PASSED TO ABOVE ADDRESSEE(S) </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ3966 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        VATICA  04605  02 OF 02  041023Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AMAD-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DODE-00  DS-00 </p><p>      FBIE-00  UTED-00  VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    VCE-00 </p><p>      NSAE-00  CAEX-01  SS-00    TEST-00  SNIS-00  NISC-00  DSCC-00 </p><p>      DRL-02   SAS-00     /003W </p><p>                  ------------------1A50ED  041111Z /38 </p><p>R 040925Z SEP 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY VATICAN </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 0000 </p><p>INFO EUROPEAN POLITICAL COLLECTIVE </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 02 VATICAN 004605 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT.

POPE JOHN PAUL II HAS NOMINATED FIVE AMERICAN PRELATES </p><p>TO PARTICIPATE IN A SPECIAL MONTH-LONG VATICAN MEETING TO </p><p>EXAMINE THE ROLE OF BISHOPS. THEY ARE CARDINAL EDWARD EGAN </p><p>OF NEW YORK, CARDINAL EDMUND SZOKA, GOVERNOR OF VATICAN </p><p>CITY, ARCHBISHOP JUSTIN REGALI OF ST. LOUIS, UKRAINIAN RITE </p><p>ARCHBISHOP STEFAN SOROKA OF PHILADELPHIA, AND AUXILIARY </p><p>BISHOP ROBERT MAGINNIS OF PHILADELPHIA. THE PAPAL NOMINEES </p><p>WILL JOIN BISHOPS ELECTED DIRECTLY BY THEIR RESPECTIVE LOCAL </p><p>"CONFERENCES" TO PARTICIPATE IN THE MEETING. THE PAPAL </p><p>NOMINEES ARE PICKED FOR THEIR PARTICULAR THEOLOGICAL </p><p>EXPERTISE AND FOR THEIR PROVEN LOYALTY TO THE HOLY SEE. IN </p><p>ADDITION TO INTERNAL CHURCH MATTERS, THE BISHOPS MEETING </p><p>WILL ALSO ADDRESS POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC ISSUES SUCH AS </p><p>GLOBALIZATION, ECOLOGY, MIGRATION, LABOR RIGHTS AND THE </p><p>EXPLOITATION OF WOMEN AND CHILDREN. THE OUTCOME OF THESE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL MEETINGS OF BISHOPS HAS A MAJOR IMPACT ON THE </p><p>DEVELOPMENT OF VATICAN FOREIGN POLICY.

(COMMENT: WHILE MUCH OF THE MILINGO-SUNG STORY WAS </p><p>THE RESULT OF JOURNALISTIC FANTASY COMBINED WITH A SUMMER </p><p>DEARTH OF NEWS, THE VATICAN WAS APPARENTLY CONCERNED ABOUT A </p><p>POSSIBLE SCHISM CRISIS WITH MILINGO LEAVING THE FOLD TO </p><p>FOUND A CHURCH AIMED AT ATTRACTING ADHERENTS IN AFRICA, LED </p><p>BY BISHOPS AND PRIESTS VALIDITY ORDAINED BY MILINGO, AND </p><p>FUNDED BY THE REVEREND SUN MYUNG MOON. THE VATICAN REGARDS </p><p>MOON AND HIS FOLLOWERS AS ANOTHER RELIGION TOTALLY DIVORCED </p><p>FROM CHRISTIANITY, AND NOT AS A SECT.
