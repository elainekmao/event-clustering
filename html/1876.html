<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 002398 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF, AF/S, AND AF/RA </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR WILLIAMS-MANIGAULT </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR DIRECTOR FRAZIER </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/09/06 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT:  SOUTH AFRICAN EMBASSY COMMENTS ON ZIMBABWE </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY DCM  REWHITEHEAD DUE TO 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) SUMMARY.  AS A CONTINUATION OF INITIAL COURTESY </p><p>CALLS, DCM MET WITH SOUTH AFRICAN COUNTERPART THOMAS RAMBAU </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  02398  01 OF 02  141109Z </p><p>ON AUGUST 8.  RAMBAU ECHOED THE PESSIMISM THAT SEEMS TO BE </p><p>THE ORDER OF THE DAY IN HIS COMMENTS ON ELECTIONS, CONSULAR </p><p>ISSUES, WAR VETERAN VISITORS, PARLIAMENTARY DELEGATIONS, </p><p>AND DIPLOMATIC BANKING PROBLEMS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>ELECTORAL ICEBERGS AHEAD </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) RAMBAU WAS NOT WELL INFORMED ON ANY POTENTIAL </p><p>SADC ELECTIONS MONITORING PROGRAM, BUT HE THOUGHT THAT IT </p><p>WAS POSSIBLE THAT SOUTH AFRICA MIGHT PROVIDE OBSERVERS </p><p>THROUGH SOME MECHANISM.  HE AGREED THAT SOUTH AFRICA\'S </p><p>QUIET DIPLOMACY HAT YIELDED FEW RESULTS THUS FAR AND </p><p>EXPRESSED SURPRISE THAT MBEKI HAD SO FRANKLY ADMITTED THIS </p><p>DURING A BBC INTERVIEW EARLIER IN THE WEEK.  HE SAID THAT </p><p>THE AIRING OF MBEKI\'S COMMENTS ON ZNBC WAS EVEN MORE </p><p>SURPRISING.  HE SURMISED THAT THE LACK OF TACTICAL EDITING </p><p>HAD BEEN AN OVERSIGHT AND SAID THAT HE HAD HEARD THAT THE </p><p>PERSON RESPONSIBLE WAS IN THE CROSS-HAIRS OF INFORMATION </p><p>MINISTER MOYO. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>CONSULAR HEADACHES </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) RAMBAU RAISED THE ONGOING CONFLICT IN CHINHOYI, </p><p>OBSERVING THAT IT HAD LANDED PARTIALLY ON HIS DESK.  FOUR </p><p>OF THE TWENTY-TWO COMMERCIAL FARMERS ARRESTED IN THE CASE </p><p>WERE BELIEVED TO HOLD SOUTH AFRICAN PASSPORTS.  (SUBSEQUENT </p><p>REPORTS INDICATE THIS IS NOT CORRECT.)  HE EXPLAINED THAT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02398  01 OF 02  141109Z </p><p>THIS WAS NOT AT ALL AN UNCOMMON OCCURRENCE.  LARGE NUMBERS </p><p>OF WHITE ZIMBABWEANS HAD RESETTLED IN SOUTH AFRICA IN THE </p><p>EARLY 1980\'S AND TAKEN UP SOUTH AFRICAN CITIZENSHIP.  MANY </p><p>OF THESE HAD CHOSEN TO RETURN TO ZIMBABWE LATER TO RECLAIM </p><p>FAMILY FARMS AND BUSINESSES, OFTEN IN PARTNERSHIP WITH </p><p>FAMILY MEMBERS WHO HAD RETAINED ZIMBABWEAN CITIZENSHIP.  HE </p><p>DESCRIBED AN INCIDENT A WEEKEND EARLIER IN WHICH HE HAD </p><p>JUGGLED PHONE CALLS BETWEEN A SOUTH AFRICAN FARMER NEAR </p><p>MUTARE AND THE POLICE AS "WAR VETERANS" MOVED CLOSER TO THE </p><p>FARMER\'S HOUSE FROM SURROUNDING BARRICADES.   THE FARMER, </p><p>WHO PLEADED FOR SOUTH AFRICAN INTERCESSION, NONETHELESS </p><p>REFUSED TO LEAVE THE HOUSE UNLESS HIS ZIMBABWEAN BROTHER </p><p>ACCOMPANIED HIM.  RAMBAU SAID THAT EVENTUALLY HE CONVINCED </p><p>THE POLICE TO ESCORT BOTH OFF THE PROPERTY. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>A RESPECTABLE WAR VET </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) DCM QUERIED RAMBAU ON PRESS REPORTS OF A SOUTH </p><p>AFRICAN WAR VETERAN LEADER WHO HAD COME TO ZIMBABWE TO MEET </p><p>WITH HIS ZIMBABWEAN COUNTERPARTS.  RAMBAU SAID THAT HE HAD </p><p>MET WITH THE MAN AND POINTED OUT THAT THE SOUTH AFRICAN WAR </p><p>VETERAN HAD PUBLICLY WAR VETERAN CONDEMNED VIOLENCE BECAUSE </p><p>IT SULLIED THE RESPECTABILITY OF THE ENTIRE MOVEMENT. </p><p>RAMBAU ADDED THAT THE SOUTH AFRICAN HAD CALLED FOR </p><p>COMPULSORY LAND ACQUISITION IN SOUTH AFRICA AS WELL AND </p><p>CALLED FOR A REGIONAL WAR VETERANS FRONT THAT INCLUDED </p><p>MOZAMBIQUE, MALAWI, AND ZAMBIA.  DCM POINTED OUT THAT THIS </p><p>GOAL MIGHT PROVE ELUSIVE, GIVEN THAT TO THE BEST OF OUR </p><p>KNOWLEDGE THERE ARE NO WAR VETERANS IN TWO OF THESE THREE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02398  01 OF 02  141109Z </p><p>COUNTRIES. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY DELEGATION OK, STATE VISIT NOT </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) RAMBAU SAID THAT PRESIDENT MBEKI, AT THE HIGH </p><p>COMMISSION\'S URGING, HAD NOT RESPONDED TO A RECENT </p><p>INVITATION FROM MUGAVE FOR A STATE VISIT.  RAMBAU SAID THAT </p><p>THE SOUTH AFRICANS DID NOT WANT HIGH LEVEL CONTACTS TO BE </p><p>MISINTERPRETED AS CONDONING GOZ POLICY.  A SOUTH AFRICAN </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY DELEGATION, HOWEVER, HAD JUST CONCLUDED A </p><p>VISIT TO ZIMBABWE.  MOST OF THE MEETINGS TOOK PLACE BETWEEN </p><p>COMMITTEE COUNTERPARTS, BUT THERE HAD BEEN CONTACTS WITH </p><p>GOZ MINISTERS.  RAMBAU DESCRIBED THE ENCOUNTER BETWEEN A </p><p>DR. MOHOWAN (SP), WHO CHAIRS THE SOUTH AFRICAN PARLIAMENT\'S </p><p>HOME AFFAIRS COMMITTEE, AND HOME AFFAIRS MINISTER NKOMO. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) RAMBAU SAID THAT HE WAS ASTONISHED AT THE APPROACH </p><p>OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN PARLIAMENTARIAN, WHO TOLD NKOMO THAT </p><p>HE HAD READ WITH INTEREST THE GOZ FAST TRACK REGULATIONS, </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTO6844 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  02398  02 OF 02  141109Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    ACQ-00   CIAE-00  USNW-00  DODE-00  DS-00 </p><p>      VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   LAB-01   VCE-00   NSAE-00  DSCC-00 </p><p>      DRL-02   NFAT-00  SAS-00     /003W </p><p>                  ------------------11F416  141109Z /38 </p><p>P 141106Z AUG 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 9460 </p><p>INFO SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>NSC WASHDC </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 002398 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF, AF/S, AND AF/RA </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR WILLIAMS-MANIGAULT </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR DIRECTOR FRAZIER </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/09/06 </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, PGOV, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT:  SOUTH AFRICAN EMBASSY COMMENTS ON ZIMBABWE </p><p> </p><p>SINCE HE WAS INTERESTED IN A LITTLE FARM OF HIS OWN.  HE </p><p>THEN LAUGHED OUT LOUD AT NKOMO\'S OBVIOUS DISCOMFITURE AND </p><p>CONTINUED TO BAIT THE MINISTER ABOUT THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF </p><p>CHANGING HIS ZIMBABWE DOLLARS BACK TO RAND WHEN HE RETURNED </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  02398  02 OF 02  141109Z </p><p>HOME, SINCE THE ZIMBABWE DOLLAR WAS NO LONGER A CONVERTIBLE </p><p>CURRENCY.  NKOMO REPLIED THAT THE GOZ WOULD TAKE STEPS ON </p><p>THE MONETARY FRONT THAT "WOULD SHOCK" THE WORLD.  RAMBAU </p><p>SAID THAT HE QUAILED TO THINK WHAT THESE MIGHT BE AND ADDED </p><p>THAT HE HAD BEEN EXTREMELY UNCOMFORTABLE DURING THE </p><p>EXCHANGE. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>MONEY TROUBLES FOR THE AFRICAN DIPLOMATIC CORPS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) RAMBAU SAID THAT THE SOUTH AFRICAN MISSION HAS NOT </p><p>HAD SERIOUS PROBLEMS WITH THE GOZ, ALTHOUGH THIS IS NOT THE </p><p>CASE FOR A NUMBER OF AFRICAN EMBASSIES.  THE FOREX SHORTAGE </p><p>HAD RESULTED IN SEVERAL BANKS INTERPRETING GOZ REGULATIONS </p><p>AS LIMITING THE FOREX THAT FOREIGN MISSIONS COULD ACCESS. </p><p>THIS HAD BEEN A REAL PROBLEM FOR EMBASSIES AND PERSONNEL </p><p>WHO SURVIVED ON DOLLAR TRANSFERS FROM HOME, AND WHO HAD NO </p><p>INTEREST IN BUYING ZIMBABWE DOLLARS AT THE OFFICIAL 55 RATE </p><p>OR WHO NEEDED U.S. CURRENCY FOR TRIPS HOME.  A DELEGATION </p><p>FROM THE AFRICAN GROUP HAD MET THE MFA PERMANENT SECRETARY </p><p>TO COMPLAIN THAT THIS VIOLATING DIPLOMATIC NORMS.  (THE </p><p>ZAMBIAN DCM OBLIQUELY REFERRED THIS MEETING IN A SEPARATE </p><p>MEETING.)   RAMBAU ASKED IF NON-AFRICAN MISSIONS HAD </p><p>ENCOUNTERED SIMILAR PROBLEMS.  DCM ADMITTED THAT AS A </p><p>NEWCOMER HE DID NOT KNOW. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02398  02 OF 02  141109Z </p><p>8.  (SBU) INITIAL MEETINGS WITH DIPLOMATS FROM ZIMBABWE\'S </p><p>AFRICAN NEIGHBORS HAVE THUS FAR BEEN CHARACTERIZED BY A </p><p>FRANKNESS THAT WE FIND UNUSUAL.  THEIR COMMENTS ARE MORE OR </p><p>LESS CONGRUENT WITH WHAT WE ARE HEARING FROM EUROPEAN AND </p><p>CANADIAN COLLEAGUES.  RAMBAU BROKE LITTLE NEW GROUND, </p><p>ALTHOUGH IT WAS AMUSING TO HEAR HIS COMMENTS ON THE </p><p>DIFFICULTY OF SCRIPTING VISITING PARLIAMENTARIANS, HARDLY A </p><p>NEW PHENOMENON ELSEWHERE. </p><p> </p><p>WHITEHEAD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
