THE </p><p>COALITION EXPOSED ITS UNEASY PARTNERSHIP, HOWEVER, BY </p><p>CREATING A BOARD COMPOSED OF ALL COALITION PARTY LEADERS TO </p><p>OVERSEE RUTELLI.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  ON JANUARY 30, THE OLIVE TREE DIRECTORATE HELD A </p><p>SIX-HOUR MEETING TO DISCUSS FRANCESCO RUTELLI\'S ROLE AS </p><p>LEADER OF THE CENTER-LEFT COALITION.  RUTELLI HAD BEEN </p><p>PUBLICLY CRITICIZED BY HIS "ALLIES" FOLLOWING SELECTION OF </p><p>ITALY\'S REPRESENTATIVES TO THE EU CONVENTION.  THE TWO </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY REPRESENTATIVES TO THE EU CONVENTION ARE NAMED </p><p>BY THE PRESIDENTS OF THE TWO CHAMBERS.  CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES </p><p>PRESIDENT PIER FERDINANDO CASINI CHOSE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC </p><p>CENTER-CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC UNION (CCD-CDU) DEPUTY MARCO </p><p>FOLLINI AND SENATE PRESIDENT MARCELLO PERA CHOSE ITALIAN </p><p>RENEWAL (RI, PART OF THE DAISY ALLIANCE) SENATOR LAMBERTO </p><p>DINI.  DEMOCRATS OF THE LEFT (DS) PRESIDENT MASSIMO D\'ALEMA </p><p>WAS NOT SELECTED, AND DS MEMBERS ACCUSED RUTELLI OF </p><p>REPRESENTING HIS OWN DAISY ALLIANCE BY FAVORING DINI OVER </p><p>D\'ALEMA, RATHER THAN CONSULTING WITH THE OLIVE TREE COALITION </p><p>ON A COALITION REPRESENTATIVE.  (ALTHOUGH THE TWO CHAMBER </p><p>PRESIDENTS CHOOSE THE DELEGATES AUTONOMOUSLY, THERE IS </p><p>USUALLY BACKSTAGE DISCUSSION ON PREFERENCES.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  AT THE JANUARY 30 MEETING, RUTELLI WAS ALLOWED TO </p><p>REMAIN LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION UNTIL THE OLIVE TREE\'S </p><p>CONVENTION IN THE FALL.  COALITION MEMBERS MADE CLEAR, </p><p>HOWEVER, THAT DURING THE DAISY CONGRESS SCHEDULED FOR APRIL, </p><p>RUTELLI MUST CHOOSE BETWEEN REMAINING THE TITULAR LEADER OF </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  00610  01 OF 02  071804Z </p><p>THE CENTER-LEFT OR PRESIDENT OF THE DAISY ALLIANCE.  IT WAS </p><p>ALSO DECIDED THAT A DIRECTORATE COMPOSED OF COALITION PARTY </p><p>LEADERS WOULD REPLACE THE POSITION OF DEPUTY COALITION LEADER </p><p>HELD BY DS SECRETARY PIERO FASSINO -- A CLEAR INDICATION THAT </p><p>THE COALITION WANTED TO EXERT GREATER CONTROL OVER RUTELLI\'S </p><p>LEADERSHIP. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  SEVERAL DAYS LATER, ON FEBRUARY 2, THE OLIVE TREE </p><p>COALITION ORGANIZED A RALLY TO DENOUNCE THE JUSTICE POLICIES </p><p>OF THE BERLUSCONI GOVERNMENT.  THE RALLY WAS MEANT TO </p><p>RELAUNCH THE COALITION FOLLOWING THE LATEST DS-DAISY CRISIS. </p><p>MOVIE DIRECTOR NANNI MORETTI (A FAMOUS DIRECTOR, LEFTIST </p><p>INTELLECTUAL, WITH CLOSE TIES TO THE DS), INVITED TO ADDRESS </p><p>THE RALLY, UNEXPECTEDLY ATTACKED OLIVE TREE LEADERS, FOCUSING </p><p>HIS IRE MAINLY ON HIS ONE-TIME DS FRIENDS.  MORETTI CHARGED </p><p>THE GROUP WITH PUTTING TOGETHER A &USELESS GATHERING.8 </p><p>ADDRESSING THE HAPLESS LEADERS, HE CONDEMNED THEM FOR DOING </p><p>NOTHING RIGHT AND FAILING UTTERLY AT SELF-REFLECTION AND </p><p>SELF-CRITICISM.  &WITH SUCH LEADERS,8 MORETTI CONTINUED, </p><p>&WE WILL NEVER WIN.  IT WILL TAKE TWO OR THREE GENERATIONS </p><p>TO BEAT BERLUSCONI.8  MORETTI\'S STINGING DENUNCIATIONS </p><p>RECEIVED WIDESPREAD MEDIA COVERAGE, RUBBING SALT IN THE </p><p>LEFT\'S (SELF-INFLICTED) WOUNDS.  THE DS, SEEKING TO AVOID </p><p>FURTHER PUBLIC DISPLAY OF DIRTY LAUNDRY, PROPOSED THAT </p><p>MORETTI AND OTHER INTELLECTUALS COME TOGETHER TO GIVE </p><p>SUGGESTIONS FOR A MORE QUALIFIED AND EFFICACIOUS OPPOSITION. </p><p>A MEETING HAS BEEN SCHEDULED FOR FEBRUARY 22; THE DS\'S PIERO </p><p>FASSINO MET WITH MORETTI FEBRUARY 7 TO DISCUSS IT FURTHER. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  COMMENT:  OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS, THE CENTER-LEFT </p><p>COALITION HAS REGISTERED MANY INTERNAL -) BUT NOT SO QUIET </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  00610  01 OF 02  071804Z </p><p>-- DISPUTES.  RUTELLI WAS NAMED LEADER OF THE OLIVE TREE </p><p>COALITION AND FASSINO THE COALITION\'S DEPUTY STRICTLY FOR </p><p>CAMPAIGN PURPOSES.  AFTER THE ELECTIONS, IT BECAME </p><p>INCREASINGLY CLEAR (AND INCREASINGLY PUBLIC) THAT RUTELLI\'S </p><p>LEADERSHIP WAS LITTLE BUT A USEFUL ELECTORAL FICTION; HE </p><p>PRESENTED HIMSELF AS LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION, AND EVEN </p><p>D\'ALEMA, IN A COUPLE OF INTERVIEWS, GRACIOUSLY CONCEDED HIM </p><p>THE TITLE.  BUT EVIDENCE POINTED TO THE CONTRARY.  DURING </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES AND VOTES, RUTELLI THEORETICALLY SPOKE </p><p>FOR THE OLIVE TREE -- WHILE THE DS SPOKE FOR ITSELF.  IN EVEN </p><p>THE SYMBOLIC, IF IMPORTANT, ACT OF EXPRESSING CONDOLENCES TO </p><p>OUR THEN-CHARGE AFTER SEPTEMBER 11, WE SAW EVIDENCE OF SHARP </p><p>ELBOWS BETWEEN RUTELLI AND D,ALEMA, WITH EACH EVENTUALLY </p><p>COMING TO THE EMBASSY SEPARATELY TO EXPRESS SYMPATHY AND </p><p>SUPPORT. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  COMMENT, CONTINUED:  THE CENTER-LEFT KNOWS IT HAS A </p><p>PROBLEM ON ITS HANDS.  SUGGESTING IT FACES POLITICAL </p><p>EXTINCTION IS CERTAINLY OVERSTATING THE POINT, BUT THE </p><p>COALITION AND ITS MEMBER PARTIES STAND LITTLE CHANCE OF BEING </p><p>MORE THAN A NATTERING CROWD ON THE EDGE OF ITALIAN POLITICS </p><p>UNLESS THEY CAN PULL TOGETHER.  IDEOLOGICAL DIFFERENCES </p><p>BETWEEN THE GROUPS MAKE IT UNLIKELY THAT THEY WILL FIND THAT </p><p>MAGICAL MEETING POINT FOR A MUTUAL PROGRAM, AND MORE </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ7764 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  00610  02 OF 02  071804Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   CIAE-00  DODE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00 </p><p>      VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00 </p><p>      AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00 </p><p>      PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SCT-00   SP-00    TRSE-00  USIE-00 </p><p>      SNIS-00  NISC-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00 </p><p>      SAS-00     /007W </p><p>                  ------------------639C7B  071805Z /38 </p><p>P 071741Z FEB 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 2019 </p><p>INFO EU MEMBER STATES COLLECTIVE </p><p>AMCONSUL FLORENCE </p><p>AMCONSUL MILAN </p><p>AMCONSUL NAPLES </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 ROME 000610 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/07/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: RUTELLI STILL "LEADER" OF ITALY,S CENTER-LEFT  -- </p><p>BUT THE COALITION CANNOT HIDE ITS DISARRAY </p><p> </p><p>IMPORTANTLY, NONE OF THE PARTIES IS WILLING TO GIVE UP </p><p>ASPIRATIONS OF NATIONAL LEADERSHIP.
