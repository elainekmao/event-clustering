<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 ABU DHABI 000325 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/RA; NEA/PPD (CBOURGEOIS; JDAVIES); ARP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EAID, PREL, KDEM, SCUL, KPAO, TC </p><p>SUBJECT:  NEXT STEPS ON U.S.-MIDDLE EAST PARTNERSHIP </p><p>INITIATIVE: UAE RESPONSE </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 015081 </p><p> </p><p>1. SUMMARY: POST WELCOMES THE LIST OF GOALS AND </p><p>OBJECTIVES, AS WELL AS THE PROPOSED PROGRAMS, DETAILED </p><p>IN REFTEL.  THEY WILL PROVIDE WELCOME REINFORCEMENT FOR </p><p>OUR ONGOING EFFORTS TO SUPPORT THE UAE\'S DEVELOPMENT IN </p><p>THESE CRITICAL AREAS. IN PARTICULAR, WE SEEK WAYS TO </p><p>ACCELERATE THE POSITIVE MOVEMENT ALREADY UNDERWAY HERE, </p><p>ESPECIALLY IN EDUCATION AND WOMEN\'S DEVELOPMENT. SINCE </p><p>THE UAE IS A WEALTHY COUNTRY, WE WILL ALSO LOOK FOR </p><p>CREATIVE COFINANCING ARRANGEMENTS WITH THE UAEG TO </p><p>ENSURE THE GREATEST POSSIBLE IMPACT FOR OUR PROGRAMS. </p><p> </p><p>OUR RESPONSE IS KEYED TO REFTEL, WITH ADDITIONAL </p><p>SUGGESTIONS ADDED AS APPROPRIATE. WE HAVE OMITTED THOSE </p><p>AREAS WHICH ARE NOT APPLICABLE TO THE UAE. END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>- - - - - -  - - - - </p><p>GOALS AND OBJECTIVES </p><p>- - - - - - - - - - </p><p> </p><p>2.  EDUCATION REFORM: </p><p> </p><p>E1.  ACCESS IS NOT A PROBLEM IN THE UAE. HOWEVER, </p><p>QUALITY IS.  WHILE THE UAE HAS SCHOOLING FOR ALL </p><p>NATIONALS, QUALITY IS UNEVEN AND METHODOLOGY IS OFTEN </p><p>OUTDATED.  SUPPORTING THE UAE IN ITS DRIVE (ALREADY </p><p>UNDERWAY) TO MODERNIZE CURRICULA, EMPHASIZE CRITICAL </p><p>THINKING, AND PREPARE FOR THE GLOBAL ECONOMY IS AN </p><p>IMPORTANT MISSION GOAL AND ONE STRONGLY SUPPORTED BY </p><p>UAEG EDUCATORS. </p><p> </p><p>E2. EXCELLENT (BY REGIONAL STANDARDS) HIGHER EDUCATION </p><p>IS AVAILABLE TO VIRTUALLY ALL. HOWEVER, THE UAE SEEKS </p><p>OUR SUPPORT FOR THEIR CONTINUING EFFORTS TO IMPROVE THE </p><p>QUALITY OF CURRICULA AND TEACHING.  THE IDEA OF LINKAGES </p><p>BETWEEN U.S. BUSINESS AND ARAB UNIVERSITIES IS ALSO </p><p>PROMISING.  SUCH LINKAGES ARE VERY LIMITED HERE AT </p><p>PRESENT, IN SPITE OF THE PRESENCE OF MANY U.S. </p><p>BUSINESSES. </p><p> </p><p>3.  ECONOMIC REFORM: </p><p> </p><p>ER1.  ALTHOUGH THE UAE HAS A RELATIVELY OPEN ECONOMY BY REGIONAL </p><p>STANDARDS, THERE IS STILL MUCH THAT REMAINS TO BE DONE.  IN THE </p><p>CONTEXT OF THE WTO, THE UAEG WOULD LIKE TO BE A MORE ACTIVE </p><p>PARTICIPANT, BUT LACKS THE HUMAN RESOURCE BASE NECESSARY TO PLAY </p><p>AN EFFECTIVE ROLE.  WTO SEMINARS/TRAINING PROGRAMS TO INCREASE </p><p>UNDERSTANDING OF, AND HOPEFULLY COMPLIANCE WITH, WTO OBLIGATIONS </p><p>SHOULD BE A KEY ECONOMIC ASPECT OF MEPI IMPLEMENTATION HERE.  THE </p><p>BEST WAY TO DELIVER THIS NEEDED TRAINING, IN OUR VIEW, WOULD BE </p><p>VIA THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A REGIONAL TECHNICAL CONSULTANCY -- IN </p><p>CONJUNCTION WITH THE ITC AND PERHAPS OTHER RELEVANT INTERNATIONAL </p><p>BODIES (WIPO ON IPR ISSUES, FOR EXAMPLE).  SUCH A CENTER, BASED </p><p>IN THE REGION, COULD BE FUNDED IN PART BY MEPI, BUT WITH THE BULK </p><p>OF MONIES COMING FROM GCC WTO MEMBERS THEMSELVES.  OUTREACH </p><p>PROGRAMS FOR THE PUBLIC (AND PARTICULARLY THE VESTED ECONOMIC </p><p>ELITES WHO MAY SEE MORE OPEN TRADE AS A THREAT) TO DEMYSTIFY THE </p><p>WTO WOULD ALSO BE HELPFUL, BUT SUCH AN INFORMATION CAMPAIGN </p><p>SHOULD NOT BE LIMITED SIMPLY TO THE WTO BUT MIGHT ALSO USEFULLY </p><p>EXTEND TO THE NEED FOR TRADE LIBERALIZATION MORE GENERALLY, </p><p>PERHAPS TO INCLUDE ELIMINATION OF ANTI-COMPETITIVE PRACTICES SUCH </p><p>AS RESTRICTIVE AGENCIES, ETC. </p><p> </p><p>ER3.  DESPITE ITS WEALTH, THE UAE IN THE NOT TOO DISTANT FUTURE </p><p>MAY BEGIN TO FACE AN UNEMPLOYMENT PROBLEM AMONG NATIONALS.  HIGH </p><p>BIRTH RATES, THE RELATIVE YOUTH OF THE POPULATION (ENSURING </p><p>THOUSANDS MORE JOB-SEEKERS ENTER THE MARKET EACH YEAR), AND THE </p><p>LIMITED CAPACITY TO CREATE NEW JOBS OF AN ECONOMY STILL DOMINATED </p><p>BY THE PUBLIC SECTOR, ALL CONTRIBUTE TO A POTENTIAL LOOMING </p><p>CRISIS, PARTICULARLY FOR WOMEN.  EMIRATI WOMEN LARGELY FILL </p><p>SECRETARIAL OR CLERICAL JOBS, BUT ARE OVERQUALIFIED FOR SUCH </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>POSITIONS.  MEPI FUNDS COULD BE USED TO SUPPORT EXISTING PROGRAMS </p><p>IN THE UAE THAT PROVIDE SPECIFIC JOB TRAINING TO NATIONALS AND </p><p>SUPPORT ENTREPRENEURSHIP AMONG WOMEN (ER3 AND WE1).  TANMIA -- </p><p>THE NATIONAL EMPLOYMENT AGENCY IN THE UAE -- AND THE VARIOUS </p><p>NATIONAL BUSINESSWOMEN\'S COMMITTEES IN THE INDIVIDUAL EMIRATES </p><p>(WHICH OPERATE UNDER THE AEGIS OF THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE) </p><p>CONDUCT ONGOING VISITOR EXCHANGE PROGRAMS AND WORK WITH PRIVATE </p><p>SECTOR FIRMS IN THE UAE AND ABROAD TO PLACE NATIONALS IN </p><p>INTERNSHIP POSITIONS.  POST BELIEVES THAT SUCH PROGRAMS WOULD BE </p><p>MOST SUCCESSFUL IN DUBAI AND THE LESS AFFLUENT NORTHERN EMIRATES, </p><p>WHERE ACCESS TO START-UP CAPITAL FOR SMALL BUSINESSES AND </p><p>OPPORTUNITIES FOR EMPLOYMENT FOR WOMEN ARE ESPECIALLY SCARCE. </p><p>4.  POLITICAL REFORM: </p><p> </p><p>P1.  THE UAE HAS NO ELECTED NATIONAL OR REGIONAL BODIES, </p><p>AND THE INTRODUCTION OF ELECTIONS WILL NEED A DECISION </p><p>FROM THE LEADERSHIP. WE WOULD LIKE TO USE MEPI FUNDS </p><p>HERE TO SUPPORT PROGRAMS AIMED AT STRENGTHENING CIVIL </p><p>SOCIETY AND INSTITUTIONS, AND IN PARTICULAR TO </p><p>SUPPORT/DEVELOP ADVOCACY GROUPS AND PROFESSIONAL BODIES. </p><p>IMPROVING THE ADMINISTRATION OF ELECTIONS IN EXISTING </p><p>NGOS AND THE PERFORMANCE OF THOSE IN APPOINTED BODIES </p><p>SUCH AS THE SHARJAH CONSULTATIVE COUNCIL (WHICH HAS FIVE </p><p>WOMEN MEMBERS), COULD ALSO BE ELEMENTS OF SUCH AN </p><p>EFFORT. </p><p> </p><p>P2.  WE CURRENTLY SUPPORT THE REFORM OF JUDICIAL SYSTEMS </p><p>AND ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE THROUGH CITIZENS\' </p><p>EXCHANGES AND INTERNATIONAL VISITOR PROGRAMS, BUT OTHER </p><p>PROGRAMS WOULD BE WELCOME. THE RECENT LAUNCHING OF </p><p>BILATERAL US-UAE TRAINING PROGRAMS IN COMBATING MONEY- </p><p>LAUNDERING, UNDERWAY IN BOTH ABU DHABI AND DUBAI, </p><p>PROVIDES AN ADDITIONAL, INDIRECT OPPORTUNITY FOR </p><p>PROMOTING THE RULE OF LAW. </p><p> </p><p>P.3.  WE WELCOME AS MANY PROGRAM OPPORTUNITIES AS </p><p>POSSIBLE TO STRENGTHEN PROFESSIONALISM IN THE MEDIA AND </p><p>SUPPORT ADHERENCE TO JOURNALISTIC STANDARDS. THERE IS </p><p>CONSIDERABLE SCOPE FOR THIS HERE: THE UAE HAS A LARGE </p><p>AND DYNAMIC MEDIA SECTOR; DUBAI HAS BECOME A REGIONAL </p><p>MEDIA HUB; RADIO SAWA IS LOCATED HERE; AND WE HAVE A </p><p>CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH ALL MEDIA OUTLETS. ANY TRAINING </p><p>PROGRAMS MUST TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE FACT THAT MANY </p><p>JOURNALISTS ARE EXPATRIATES.  TRAINING SHOULD BE </p><p>AVAILABLE TO NON-NATIONALS, WHOSE INFLUENCE IS </p><p>CONSIDERABLE. OTHER AIMS SHOULD BE PURSUED WITHIN THE </p><p>CONTEXT OF THE BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP. </p><p> </p><p>5. DIGITAL READINESS CROSS-CUT: </p><p> </p><p>DR1-2. THE UAE, PARTICULARLY DUBAI, IS ALREADY ADVANCED </p><p>IN THIS AREA.  THEY USE CUTTING-EDGE TECHNOLOGY AND ARE </p><p>PIONEERS IN E-GOVERNMENT AND E-COMMERCE. WE SUGGEST </p><p>DRAWING ON THE UAE\'S EXPERIENCE IN THIS AREA FOR USE </p><p>WITH OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE REGION; THEY MAY BE ABLE TO </p><p>PROVIDE ARABIC-LANGUAGE MATERIALS, FACILITIES FOR </p><p>REGIONAL WORKSHOPS, AND OTHER SUPPORT FOR OUR PROGRAMS </p><p>IN THIS AREA. </p><p> </p><p>D3. THE UAE IS ALREADY VERY ACTIVE IN THIS AREA, BUT THE </p><p>FINANCES OF THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION (A FEDERAL </p><p>MINISTRY) ARE LIMITED, SO NOT ALL SCHOOLS HAVE THESE </p><p>FACILITIES YET.  TRAINING FOR UAE EDUCATION OFFICIALS IN </p><p>REGIONAL PROGRAMS ON THIS WOULD SUPPORT THE MOMENTUM. </p><p> </p><p>6.  WOMEN\'S EMPOWERMENT CROSS-CUT (SEE ALSO ER3: </p><p> </p><p>WE1: IMPORTANT. PROGRESS UNDERWAY HERE, WITH FORMATION </p><p>OF WOMEN\'S BUSINESS ASSOCIATIONS AND UAEG PROGRAMS TO </p><p>SUPPORT WOMEN\'S ENTRY INTO THE PRIVATE SECTOR. </p><p>PRACTICAL SKILLS TRAINING IN SETTING UP AND RUNNING A </p><p>BUSINESS IS NEEDED.  BRINGING MORE WOMEN SPEAKERS TO THE </p><p>REGION TO ADDRESS RELEVANT ISSUES COULD HELP WITH OUR </p><p>OUTREACH EFFORTS. </p><p> </p><p>WE4: WOMEN\'S NGOS ARE ACTIVE HERE BUT NEED MORE </p><p>INTERACTION WITH COUNTERPARTS ELSEWHERE IN THE REGION </p><p>AND ABROAD. </p><p> </p><p>------- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - </p><p>7.  PROPOSED MEPI PROGRAM PLAN (COMMENTS LIMITED TO </p><p>THOSE RELEVANT TO THE UAE): </p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - </p><p> </p><p>--WORLD BANK CIVIL SOCIETY PROJECTS: EXCELLENT </p><p>SUGGESTIONS, USEFUL AND RELEVANT HERE. </p><p> </p><p>--CIVITAS REGIONAL CIVIC ED PROGRAM:  EXTREMELY </p><p>IMPORTANT.  THE UAE IS KEEN TO INCORPORATE CIVIC </p><p>EDUCATION INTO ITS CURRICULA. REGIONAL WORKSHOPS WOULD </p><p>ALLOW FOR GCC-WIDE DISCUSSION/DEVELOPMENT OF THIS BUT </p><p>MIGHT ALSO RESTRICT PROGRESS. THIS WAS A LEADING REQUEST </p><p>OF OUR PARTICIPANTS IN THE DAS CHENEY-LED MEPI </p><p>INTERNATIONAL VISITOR PROGRAM. </p><p>--MEET US:  EXCELLENT IDEA. SHOULD BE COMPLEMENTED BY </p><p>REGIONAL TRAINING WORKSHOPS. </p><p> </p><p>--INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY FOR BETTER GOVERNMENT ETC.: </p><p>INVOLVE THE UAE BUT ASK THEM ALSO TO SHARE THEIR </p><p>EXPERIENCE (ESPECIALLY DUBAI\'S) IN THIS AREA AS A MODEL. </p><p> </p><p>--GULF TRADE/WTP SEMINARS: SEE (ER1) ABOVE. GOOD IDEA. </p><p> </p><p>--ARAB BUSINESS WOMEN NETWORK: GOOD IDEA. </p><p>--E-LEARNING: PROMOTING ACTIVE LEARNING VERY IMPORTANT. </p><p> </p><p>--TEACHER TRAINING FOR EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION: VITAL, </p><p>BUT VITAL ALSO TO INCLUDE A PARENTAL COMPONENT, OFTEN </p><p>LACKING IN THIS WEALTHY SOCIETY WHERE THERE ARE LARGE </p><p>FAMILIES AND HOUSEHOLD SERVANTS. </p><p> </p><p>--ARAB TEACHERS CIVIC EDUCATION: EXCELLENT IDEA. </p><p> </p><p>--SUMMER INSTITUTE FOR UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT LEADERS; </p><p>EXCELLENT IDEA. </p><p> </p><p>--REVITALIZE ENGLISH LANGUAGE TEACHING NETWORKS.  ALL </p><p>THESE IDEAS ARE IMPORTANT AND APPLICABLE HERE. </p><p> </p><p>--LITERACY PROGRAMMING: THE UAE HAS ONE OF THE HIGHEST </p><p>LITERACY RATES IN THE ARAB WORLD. HOWEVER, THEY NEED </p><p>SUPPORT IN PROGRAMS FOR READING FOR YOUNG LEARNERS, </p><p>ADULT LITERACY, AND SELF-DIRECTED LEARNING. </p><p> </p><p>8.  COMMENT: </p><p> </p><p>A. REGIONAL PROGRAMS (BOTH FOR AND IN THE REGION) ARE </p><p>ESSENTIAL. SMALL GULF POSTS DO NOT HAVE THE MANPOWER TO </p><p>UNDERTAKE MORE PROGRAMMING THAN THEY ALREADY HAVE. </p><p>FURTHERMORE, REGIONAL PROGRAMS WILL OFFER PARTICIPANTS </p><p>THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONDUCT AMONGST THEMSELVES THE SORT </p><p>OF DEBATE ABOUT REFORM WHICH WE ARE TRYING TO ENCOURAGE. </p><p>PROGRAMS BASED IN THE REGION WILL ALLOW MORE </p><p>CONSERVATIVE GROUPS (SUCH AS WOMEN) TO PARTICIPATE. </p><p> </p><p>B. POLITICAL COVER IS IMPORTANT, GIVEN THE POLITICAL </p><p>CLIMATE AT PRESENT. PROGRAMS BUILT ON SHARED INTERESTS </p><p>WILL BE ACCEPTED MORE READILY AND HAVE MORE RESONANCE IN </p><p>THE REGION THAN THOSE PERCEIVED TO BE IMPOSED BY THE US. </p><p>THE SUPPORT OF LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS - MINISTRIES OF </p><p>EDUCATION, FOR EXAMPLE, WILL ALSO HELP OVERCOME THE </p><p>OPPOSITION OF CONSERVATIVE ELEMENTS OF GULF SOCIETY </p><p>RELIGIOUS AND TRIBAL LEADERS. END COMMENT </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
