<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HO CHI MINH CITY 000691 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>Department for EAP/BCLTV, DRL, PRM </p><p> </p><p>E. O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PGOV, PREF, SOCI, KIRF, VM, HUMANR, ETMIN, RELFREE </p><p>SUBJECT: SURPRISING REVELATIONS ON PROTESTANTS IN CENTRAL </p><p>HIGHLANDS </p><p> </p><p>REF:  HCMC 1270 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  Summary:  While the official rhetoric seemed to focus </p><p>on respect for religion and the importance of meeting the </p><p>"spiritual needs" of the people during the Ambassador\'s recent </p><p>visit to Dak Lak and Lam Dong provinces, local Protestant church </p><p>leaders told a story of continuing limits on organized religious </p><p>worship amidst a flourishing underground church.  Unlike the </p><p>province\'s Catholics, who suffer most from official control over </p><p>numbers of seminarians and priests, Protestants seem to face </p><p>almost impossible conditions on sanctioned worship and the </p><p>registration of new churches.  Most startling was the perhaps </p><p>unintended disclosure by local Protestant representatives that the </p><p>vast majority of unofficial house churches have already applied </p><p>for official recognition, despite government claims that only a </p><p>handful have tried to legalize their status.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  The Ambassador, Emboffs, and ConGenoffs visited Dak Lak </p><p>and Lam Dong provinces July 23-26, making calls on the People\'s </p><p>Committees, religious leaders, and the provincial government </p><p>offices responsible for religious and ethnic minority affairs. </p><p>They also visited government offices responsible for economic </p><p>planning and investment, private businesses, local universities, </p><p>and a local village (septels). </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  Lam Dong People\'s Committee Chairman Phan Thien </p><p>described human rights and religious freedom as a process -- one </p><p>in which Vietnam wanted to obtain the highest level. </p><p>Acknowledging the importance of religion to fulfill the spiritual </p><p>needs of the people, Chairman Thien said that local authorities </p><p>should develop a better understanding of the regulations governing </p><p>religion to better deal with religious believers.  At the same </p><p>time, he held the Protestants responsible for a historical </p><p>association with separatists that made it difficult to distinguish </p><p>between authentic believers and Dega.  While comparing the </p><p>screening of applications for new Protestant churches to the </p><p>scrutiny accorded Muslims in the U.S. in the aftermath of 9/11, he </p><p>assured the Ambassador that he had instructed the relevant </p><p>authorities to speed up the recognition process. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  Dak Lak People\'s Committee Chairman Nguyen Van Lang </p><p>characterized his guiding principle in dealing with religion as </p><p>respect for individual freedom to worship.  He reminded the </p><p>Ambassador that 22 pastors from Dak Lak had traveled to attend the </p><p>organizing conference for the government recognized Southern </p><p>Evangelical Church of Vietnam (SECV) in April 2001.  Currently, he </p><p>said, there were two legal Protestant churches in the province. </p><p>Two more were under consideration by provincial officials.  Asked </p><p>directly about reports of church closures, Chairman Lang responded </p><p>that no "churches" could have been closed since there were only </p><p>the two legal churches.  (Comment:  Betraying what may come closer </p><p>to his real feelings on the subject, he pointed out that the </p><p>ethnic minorities were never religious until they were converted </p><p>by foreigners. End comment)  He noted a steady decrease in the </p><p>number of migrants to Dak Lak --both Kinh Vietnamese and ethnic </p><p>minorities -- even as the economy continued to grow. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  Vo Van Tai, Chairman of the Dak Lak provincial </p><p>Committee on Religious and Ethnic Minority Affairs, provided a </p><p>somewhat longer recitation on the current state of religion in Dak </p><p>Lak.  He said there were presently 100,000 Buddhists (up from </p><p>40,000 in 1975), 5,000 Cao Dai, and 213,00 Catholics (up from </p><p>60,000 over the same period) in Dak Lak.  The Catholic Church had </p><p>gone from one bishop and 34 priests to 2 bishops and 78 priests </p><p>during that time, and currently had three seminarians from the </p><p>province studying at the Sea Star Seminary in Nha Trang.  He said </p><p>there were 130,000 Protestants in Dak Lak, including 40,000 who </p><p>had been "officially baptized," but became quite angry at the </p><p>Ambassador\'s reference to the "Dega" as Protestants.  To </p><p>demonstrate the province\'s other achievements, he noted that a Dak </p><p>Lak pastor currently served on the SECV Executive Board in HCMC, </p><p>while two ethnic minority students studied at the SECV seminary </p><p>there.  As an aside, he remarked that eight others had "failed" to </p><p>meet the entrance requirements for the seminary, but did not </p><p>elaborate on whether those were the requirements of the SECV or </p><p>the government. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  According to Chairman Tai, the two legal Protestant </p><p>churches, recognized in late 2001, served approximately 1,000 </p><p>believers in Buon Me Thuot and Phuoc An (30 kilometers form the </p><p>provincial capital).  Giving slightly different numbers than </p><p>Chairman Lang, he said that four more churches had applied for </p><p>recognition and were currently under consideration.  The two </p><p>applications he had discussed with the Consul General on her last </p><p>visit (ref A) had merely been verbal at the time, but had now been </p><p>submitted officially in writing.  Describing the registration </p><p>process, he said the SECV required that each church </p><p>("association") have 200 members before it could apply for </p><p>recognition.  Once approved, they could then apply for permission </p><p>to build an actual church structure and assign a permanent pastor. </p><p>While all were free to practice at home alone, problems sometimes </p><p>arose when groups tried to practice their faith in an organized </p><p>manner.  He added that churches could not be issued permits to </p><p>build until they were recognized.  However, they could only be </p><p>recognized after they had gathered informally for a time and then </p><p>asked for permission.  Unrecognized churches needed to be </p><p>disbanded because they were built without permits and were </p><p>inherently dangerous. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU)  Emphasizing that all legal church and social activities </p><p>were allowed so long as they did not harm society, Chairman Tai </p><p>gave his personal assurance that no provincial official had ever </p><p>tried to disband an existing church, or attempt to force the </p><p>renunciation of anyone\'s religious faith.  Referring to the list </p><p>of specific cases provided by the Consul General on her last </p><p>visit, he assured the Ambassador that none of the 43 individuals </p><p>named could have been arrested for religious reasons because none </p><p>were on the provincial list of religious believers.  The </p><p>Ambassador suggested Chairman Tai send the list to MPS to see if </p><p>any of the 43 was on the list of people who had actually been </p><p>arrested. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU)  The provincial SECV Representative Board provided a </p><p>surprisingly frank assessment of the situation faced by </p><p>Protestants in Dak Lak.  The local Board consists of ethnic </p><p>minority Ede pastors Y Ta and Y Ke Eban, as well as Truong Xuan </p><p>Dieu, a former chaplain in the Army of the Republic of Vietnam and </p><p>the current legal pastor of the recognized church in Phuoc An. </p><p>They received the Ambassador in the home (and house church) of an </p><p>unrecognized Kinh pastor who serves as secretary to the Board. </p><p>Pastor Dieu was unable to attend.  Speaking generally about </p><p>conditions for worship in Dak Lak, the pastors noted that the two </p><p>legal churches (Pastor Dieu\'s mixed Kinh and Ede congregation and </p><p>Pastor Mai Hai\'s predominantly Ede congregation in town) were able </p><p>to operate regular Sunday schools.  Most of the remainder of the </p><p>province\'s Protestants practiced their faith at home, but some </p><p>still gathered together unofficially.  While there were not enough </p><p>bibles to go around, the Board had requested more from provincial </p><p>authorities and the SECV offices in HCMC. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU)  The three pastors affirmed that there were currently </p><p>four applications for recognition pending government approval -- </p><p>three belonging to them and a fourth for an ethnic minority M\'nong </p><p>pastor in Dak Min District.  The four congregations had close to </p><p>5,000 members between them (the Kinh was the smallest, with only </p><p>500), and the government had promised they would be approved this </p><p>year.  They understood that the government needed to look at the </p><p>background of the pastors and the "conditions of worship" among </p><p>the believers, but assured the Ambassador that they were all </p><p>"authentic" Protestants. </p><p>"Troublemakers" sometimes came to local house churches talking of </p><p>separatism, but there was no contact with foreigners.  The pastors </p><p>then confided that they had actually forwarded 70 applications for </p><p>recognition in late 2002.  Provincial authorities had then picked </p><p>out just the four for possible approval. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU)  Comment:  While the meetings with provincial officials </p><p>covered little or no new ground, the rather startling revelation </p><p>by the SECV Board regarding the large number of applications </p><p>submitted for official recognition provides the first real </p><p>evidence that the GVN has been going slow on new church approvals. </p><p>Prior to departing for the trip, ConGenoffs heard a similar </p><p>allegation from a Lam Dong pastor with whom they met in HCMC. </p><p>According to that source, all of the house churches in Lam Dong </p><p>had already applied for recognition through the appropriate SECV </p><p>channels.  There, too, the provincial authorities seemed to be </p><p>picking and choosing a few churches for possible recognition, </p><p>while the others were afraid to press for attention.  At the very </p><p>least, this points to something less than honesty and fair dealing </p><p>from the provincial administrations (and possibly the central </p><p>government).  At the same time, this new information may present a </p><p>unique opportunity to challenge the government on the slow rate of </p><p>approvals and bring light to what has thus far been a very  opaque </p><p>process.  The bottom line, though, is that despite GVN heavy- </p><p>handedness and not atypical slow operating procedures, religious </p><p>life for Christians continues, albeit mostly in non-recognized, </p><p>unofficial church gatherings. </p><p>WHITE </p><p></p></div>
