<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 001295 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR SA/INS, INR </p><p> </p><p>SECRET </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/04/2013 </p><p>TAGS: WFP </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL: WORLD FOOD PROGRAM DEALS WITH MAOISTS AND </p><p>GOVERNMENT CORRUPTION </p><p> </p><p>REF: KATHMANDU 1221 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM Robert Boggs for Reasons 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (S) Summary.  The World Food Program (WFP) in Nepal has </p><p>been operating in the most heavily Maoist-affected areas in </p><p>Nepal since the last quarter of 2002.  WFP Director </p><p>Joergensen reports that through April 2003, the cease-fire </p><p>had enabled villagers and traders to travel freely, </p><p>increasing access to food in Maoist-controlled areas.  WFP </p><p>field officers do, however, encounter frequent difficulties </p><p>with Maoist cadres.  Since May 2003, Director Joergensen </p><p>began receiving reports from the field of heightened security </p><p>and increased travel restrictions by the Maoists.  Anecdotal </p><p>evidence suggests that the Maoist organization is </p><p>well-coordinated, with a sophisticated intelligence gathering </p><p>network.  WFP Nepal has also encountered trouble with central </p><p>and district level government corruption, which has resulted </p><p>in their filing of four legal cases with the Commission to </p><p>Investigate Abuses of Authority (CIAA).  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) The World Food Program (WFP) in Nepal is one of two </p><p>UN-based agencies (the other is UNICEF) working daily in the </p><p>most heavily Maoist-affected areas in the country.  Because </p><p>government corruption had been preventing the efficient </p><p>delivery of food to high-risk areas, shortly after her </p><p>arrival in August 2002 WFP Director Erika Joergensen </p><p>decentralized WFP\'s Nepal program to the district level. </p><p>Today WFP employs 24 Nepali field officers in 30 of Nepal\'s </p><p>75 districts and staffs four regional offices, including one </p><p>in Kathmandu.  WFP programs focus on rural community </p><p>infrastructure building, such as road construction and </p><p>irrigation projects, mother and child heath and nutrition, </p><p>and food for education initiatives.  WFP also provides the </p><p>food for 100,000 Bhutanese refugees in seven camps in Eastern </p><p>Nepal.  Most recently, WFP received permission from the </p><p>Government of Nepal to implement a Quick Impact Program.  The </p><p>program will mobilize 1,500 tons of food for ten districts </p><p>with heightened levels of food insecurity, often caused by </p><p>Maoist insurgents restricting villagers\' access to markets. </p><p>These districts are Humla, Mugu, Dolpa, Rukum, Rolpa, </p><p>Jajarkot, Kalikot, Jumla, Bajura, and Bajhang. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) In its January through March quarterly report, WFP </p><p>Nepal reported that the cease-fire has largely been holding </p><p>without major incident.  A modicum of peace and stability has </p><p>returned to districts that had been highly influenced by </p><p>insurgent activities.  There has been increased freedom of </p><p>movement for both people and commodities.  As a result, many </p><p>people who had left villages because of security concerns </p><p>reportedly have been returning and, in some cases, police and </p><p>Royal Nepal Army soldiers have been able to visit their </p><p>families at the village level after long absences.  However, </p><p>significant apprehension remains in the western districts of </p><p>Nepal that peace talks will not produce results.  In May, WFP </p><p>field officers began reporting stepped-up security and </p><p>increased travel restrictions by the Maoists. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>Dealing with the Maoists </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>4. (S) Working primarily in heavily Maoist-affected areas, </p><p>the field officers encounter frequent difficulties in </p><p>implementing WFP programs.  From the beginning, Joergensen </p><p>required her field officers to spend the first month </p><p>introducing themselves to district-level government </p><p>officials, NGOs and the Maoists so that all parties would be </p><p>aware of WFP\'s programs and objectives.  This approach has </p><p>enabled her field officers to move freely in areas that are </p><p>otherwise heavily restricted by the Maoists.  The only </p><p>district that remains largely inaccessible is Kalikot, where </p><p>the Maoist district commander reportedly is uncooperative and </p><p>violent. </p><p> </p><p>5. (S) However, according to Director Joergensen, the Maoists </p><p>have attempted to intimidate WFP field officers and to steal </p><p>food and equipment from WFP.  In Western Nepal\'s Bajura </p><p>District, Maoists seized the local WFP officer and detained </p><p>him for ten days, she said.  During his detention, he was </p><p>taken to the Maoist district commander\'s tent in the jungle. </p><p>Although they had never met, the commander pondered for a few </p><p>minutes, wondering where he had seen the WFP officer before. </p><p>Asking his subordinate for a file, the commander pulled out a </p><p>paper with the field officer\'s photograph and biographic </p><p>information, including his year of birth and previous </p><p>employment. </p><p>6. (S) More frequently, Maoist cadres steal WFP food supplies </p><p>either to eat or sell for cash, Joergensen reported.  When </p><p>this has happened, WFP has shut down its program in the area </p><p>and explained to the residents that until the goods are </p><p>returned, the program could not continue.  Surprisingly, the </p><p>Maoists typically have returned what they did not eat or sell </p><p>and, in some cases, worked off the rest.  Clearly, WFP is </p><p>providing necessary goods for the very poor and </p><p>underprivileged people that the Maoist organization claims to </p><p>be supporting. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>Government Corruption </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (S) Prior to decentralizing its operations, WFP </p><p>experienced significant setbacks with Government of Nepal </p><p>(GON) cooperation.  WFP provides 100 percent funding for all </p><p>food distributed in Nepal and 50 percent of the </p><p>transportation cost, with the GON contributing the other 50 </p><p>percent.  Joergensen learned soon after her arrival that much </p><p>of WFP\'s transportation fund was not being drawn upon by the </p><p>GON for the transportation and delivery of food.  She later </p><p>discovered that government officials at both the central and </p><p>district levels had been stealing food and selling it for </p><p>their own personal profit.  On the basis of these complaints, </p><p>Joergensen has filed four cases, which are now pending, with </p><p>the Commission to Investigate Abuses of Authority (CIAA). </p><p>(Note: The CIAA is a GON agency mandated with investigating </p><p>allegations of government corruption (reftel).  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) WFP Nepal has also encountered less serious, but still </p><p>troublesome, cases of government corruption.  For example, </p><p>district-level officials were directing WFP to contract the </p><p>transportation and food distribution to businesses owned by </p><p>family and friends.  Within the central government, officials </p><p>in the Ministries of Finance, Agriculture and Local </p><p>Development would request training abroad ostensibly to learn </p><p>how the French, for example, run school lunch programs. </p><p>After WFP denied their requests, Director Joergensen </p><p>explained, Ministry officials would "stop working on WFP </p><p>programs." </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (S) Through the WFP field officers\' encounters with </p><p>Maoists in western Nepal, it appears that the insurgents are </p><p>well-coordinated and very well-informed.  Most district </p><p>commanders appear to be staying \'on message\' by allowing WFP </p><p>to operate relatively unhindered, distributing food to the </p><p>most needy, even in predominantly Maoist-controlled areas. </p><p>The WFP\'s experience of increasing Maoist restrictions on </p><p>travel are consistent with reports from other aid agencies of </p><p>rising levels of Maoist extortion and threats agains local </p><p>development workers.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
