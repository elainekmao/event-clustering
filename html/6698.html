<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KUWAIT 001056 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARP </p><p>USDOC FOR 3131/USFCS/OIO/ANESA </p><p>USDOC FOR 4520/MAC/AME </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/22/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, EINV, IZ, KU </p><p>SUBJECT: SADDAM,S DEFEAT COULD BE A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY FOR </p><p>KUWAIT,S BUSINESSMEN--IF THEY SEIZE THE MOMENT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Richard H. Jones for reasons 1.5 (d) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary:  Long before the fighting began on Kuwait\'s </p><p>northern border, Kuwaiti firms were bombarding the Embassy </p><p>with requests to do business with U.S. and coalition forces </p><p>here, and expressing commercial interests in a post-Saddam </p><p>Iraq.  Kuwaiti businessmen see Kuwait as the logical </p><p>jumping-off point for any firm wishing to profit from the </p><p>reconstruction of Iraq, but as yet seem to have few solid </p><p>plans to enter the Iraqi market themselves, or attract </p><p>foreign partners to do so.  What\'s more, few Kuwaiti </p><p>businessmen or officials see the need for reform in Kuwait, </p><p>either of the country\'s decidedly xenophobic investment laws, </p><p>or of a business culture that rewards commercial families </p><p>with connections, rather than entrepreneurs with novel ideas. </p><p> As shown by the pre-war success of smaller companies </p><p>vis--vis traditional Kuwaiti business families,  Kuwaitis </p><p>will likely have to reinvent their approach to business, or </p><p>at least start planning, if they hope to have a piece of the </p><p>Iraq reconstruction pie.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>The Early Bird Needs No Wasta </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) In the last few weeks building up to the war now being </p><p>fought in Iraq, post\'s Commercial and Economic sections </p><p>received hundreds of requests from Kuwaiti companies hoping </p><p>to do business with the U.S. and Allied forces being </p><p>pre-positioned in Kuwait.  Spurred by the news that some </p><p>among them were making fortunes supplying a rapidly expanding </p><p>number of U.S. forces, Kuwaiti companies began a barrage of </p><p>faxes and phone calls to the Embassy (Post\'s FCS office </p><p>received 40-50 requests per day, which were passed to the </p><p>Army\'s Directorate of Contracting, KU, at Camp Doha).  In </p><p>addition, the Acting Commercial Officer (A/CO) received </p><p>requests through colleagues in almost every section of the </p><p>embassy, who had been contacted by their Kuwaiti friends and </p><p>neighbors seeking an entree into the military market. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Alongside these requests came complaints.  Large </p><p>commercial families with wide-ranging interests in Kuwait </p><p>said they were being prevented from from dealing directly </p><p>with the U.S. military, and protested that \'commercial </p><p>agents,\' many of them third-country nationals, were profiting </p><p>greatly from their roles as middlemen to the U.S. military. </p><p>(Comment: Although not specifically stated, it was clear that </p><p>the largest of these commercial families were angry they </p><p>apppeared to be missing an opportunity to sell to the U.S. </p><p>military.  Worse, the fact that third-country nationals were </p><p>profiting from quick action and adaptability was an obvious </p><p>irritant to Kuwaitis used to getting their way in domestic </p><p>business dealings.  End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>Where\'s the Plan? </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) During the pre-war period, A/CO also visited Kuwaiti </p><p>businesses and commercial organizations to hear their plans </p><p>for post-war involvement in Iraq.  Some businessmen were </p><p>clear about their intentions.  Well-known businessman Saud </p><p>al-Arfaj, for example, said he was interested in partnering </p><p>with U.S. companies here in Kuwait to do business in Iraq. </p><p>Others, such as the al-Ghanim family, are known to be </p><p>stockpiling goods in Kuwait\'s Free Trade Zone for eventual </p><p>sale to Iraq.  But even while expressing their belief that </p><p>Kuwait would undoubtably play a vital role in Iraq\'s </p><p>reconstruction, few could explain with any coherence what </p><p>their specific plan was for entry into the Iraqi market. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Most telling of all was a visit to the Director </p><p>General of Kuwait\'s Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI), </p><p>Mr. Ahmed al-Haroun.  Mr. al-Haroun said KCCI did not have </p><p>any specific plans for involvement in Iraq, although it </p><p>expected to be involved there commercially.  Further, he </p><p>said, Kuwaiti companies wishing to partner with </p><p>multinationals to do business in Iraq (as in the case of Mr. </p><p>al-Arfaj) would find plenty already in the domestic market; </p><p>after all, Mr. al-Haroun said, Kuwait\'s foreign investment </p><p>laws are "perfect." </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Comment:  When combined, al-Haroun\'s statements, a </p><p>lack of planning by individual businessmen and Kuwaiti </p><p>complaints during the pre-war period seem to paint a picture </p><p>of a business sector ill-prepared to operate outside the </p><p>protective cocoon of a Kuwaiti business environment, where </p><p>personal influence, or wasta, is the modus operandi.  Even if </p><p>Kuwaiti businesses hoped to partner with U.S. companies, </p><p>Kuwait\'s antiquated business laws are a direct and often </p><p>insurmountable obstacle to companies looking to enter the </p><p>Kuwaiti market, or simply make the country their regional </p><p>base. (Foreign companies are required to have a Kuwaiti </p><p>majority stakeholder, on top of being taxed at 55%).  If </p><p>Kuwaitis are serious about entering a liberated Iraqi market, </p><p>they will need to develop a serious plan to do so.  End </p><p>Comment. </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
