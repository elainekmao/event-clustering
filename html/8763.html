WFP has just released a report on Global Food Aid </p><p>deliveries in 2002 entitled "2002 Food Aid Flows, May 2003." </p><p>The trends by geographic region are highlighted below. The </p><p>data clearly reveals that the United States, which provided </p><p>64 percent of all global food aid and 50 percent of all </p><p>emergency food assistance this past year, is by far the </p><p>world\'s leader in food assistance. Yet deliveries by the </p><p>European Commission (all categories), decreased from 960,000 </p><p>metric tons in 2001 to 570,000 mts in 2002. Deliveries by </p><p>most European countries also decreased, with the exception </p><p>of Germany, Italy and The Netherlands. Facing continuing </p><p>real needs and growing shortfalls (particularly in </p><p>emergencies), the time appears once again opportune for a </p><p>revitalization of efforts on both sides of the Atlantic to </p><p>move beyond our differences in outlook and perspective on </p><p>food aid. End summary. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>Regional analysis - Sub-Saharan Africa </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. Sub-Saharan Africa received some 3 million tons of food </p><p>aid in 2002, about 31 percent of world-wide deliveries. 58 </p><p>percent of the food assistance to the region was delivered </p><p>through multilateral channels, 31 percent through non- </p><p>governmental organizations (NGOs) and 11 percent on a </p><p>bilateral basis. Less than two percent was provided in the </p><p>form of consessional sales. Main recipients were: Ethiopia, </p><p>400,000 metric tons (mts); Angola, 240,000 mts; Zimbabwe, </p><p>220,000 mts; Malawi, 200,000 mts; Kenya, 190,000 mts; </p><p>Eritrea, 180,000 mts; Mozambique, 170,000 mts; and Sudan, </p><p>140,000 mts. The main donors were the United States (64 </p><p>percent), the European Union (Commission and Member States) </p><p>(21 percent) and Japan (7 percent). WFP delivered 83 percent </p><p>of the emergency food aid provided to sub-Saharan Africa in </p><p>2002. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>Latin America and Caribbean region </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. Latin America and the Caribbean received 1.18 million </p><p>tons of food assistance in 2002. 53 percent was channeled </p><p>through NGOs, 39 percent was provided bilaterally and 8 </p><p>percent multilaterally. Of the food aid delivered to the </p><p>region, 74 percent was sold on the market; twenty percent of </p><p>the deliveries were direct consessional sales. The main </p><p>recipient countries were: Guatemala (250,000 mts; Peru, </p><p>240,000 mts; and Haiti, 180,000 mts. Other important </p><p>recipents were Bolivia, El Salvador and Ecuador.

The deliveries to Eastern Europe and Commonwealth of </p><p>Independent States (CIS) countries in 2002 amounted to </p><p>970,000 mts, 10 percent of global food deliveries. Emergency </p><p>and project food assistance together accounted for 69 </p><p>percent of overall deliveries. 40 percent of the food aid </p><p>was channeled through NGOs, 31 percent was provided </p><p>multilaterally and 29 percent bilaterally. The main </p><p>recipient countries were: Tajikistan  (200,000 mts; </p><p>Uzbekistan, 200,000 mts; and Bosnia and Herzegovina, 100,000 </p><p>mts.

The major donors </p><p>were the United States (82 percent), and the Commission and </p><p>member states of the EU (15 percent). WFP delivered 86 </p><p>percent of the emergency food aid, but was not involved in </p><p>project (development) assistance. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>Middle East and North Africa </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. Food aid deliveries to the countries of the Middle East </p><p>and North Africa in 2002 amounted to 750,000 metric tons, </p><p>eight percent of global deliveries. Emergency and project </p><p>food aid together represented 59 percent of deliveries. 41 </p><p>percent of the food assistance to the region was provided </p><p>bilaterally, 36 percent through NGOs and 23 percent </p><p>multilaterally.

Other highlights of the report are as follows: </p><p> </p><p>-         The United States provided 64 percent of all </p><p>global food aid and 50 percent of all emergency food </p><p>assistance; </p><p>-         The EC and its member states provided 14 percent </p><p>of all global food aid and 19 percent of overall emergency </p><p>food aid in 2002; </p><p>-         Deliveries by the European Commission (all </p><p>categories) decreased from 960,000 metric tons in 2001 to </p><p>570,000 mts in 2002. Of this total, 365,039 mts were for </p><p>emergency relief, 64,431 mts for project development aid, </p><p>and 143,199 mts were donated bilaterally. Deliveries by most </p><p>European countries also decreased, with the exception of </p><p>Germany, Italy and The Netherlands; </p><p>-         WFP delivered 68 percent of world-wide emergency </p><p>food aid in 2002; </p><p>-         About 18 percent of emergency food aid provided in </p><p>2002 was procured through local purchases or triangular </p><p> </p><p>purchases; </p><p>-         88 percent of global food aid in 2002 was on full </p><p>grant terms (8.4 million tons), while 12 percent (1.2 </p><p>million tons were provided on consessional terms, largely by </p><p>the United States and the Republic of Korea; </p><p>-         Of the 9.6 million tons of commodities </p><p>constituting food assistance in 2002, about one million tons </p><p>were procured in developing countries; and finally, </p><p>-         99 percent of global food assistance (some 9.5 </p><p>million tons) in 2002 went to developing countries of which </p><p>8 million tons (83 percent went to low-income, food- </p><p>deficient countries. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8. Globally, there is an increasing trend to use food aid to </p><p>target people rather than providing import substitutions. 10 </p><p>percent of global food aid is now purchased in developing </p><p>countries. Targeted food aid flows in both emergency and </p><p>development settings are now driven more by case-by-case </p><p>assessment of the urgency of human problems and are </p><p>increasingly provided on a multilateral basis or through </p><p>NGOs. WFP is the dominant player in the delivery of </p><p>worldwide emergency food aid (68 percent in 2002); this </p><p>percentage will only increase in 2003 given WFP\'s essential </p><p>role in the Iraq humanitarian response. </p><p> </p><p>9. Facing continuing real needs and growing shortfalls </p><p>(particularly in emergencies), and a further decline in </p><p>deliveries by the EC in 2002, the time appears opportune for </p><p>a revitalization of efforts on both sides of the Atlantic to </p><p>move beyond our differences in outlook and perspective on </p><p>food aid.
