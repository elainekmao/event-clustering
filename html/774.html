SUMMARY:  IN A MEETING WITH CROATIAN INTERIOR MINISTER </p><p>JARNJAK, ASSISTANT SECRETARY SHATTUCK EMPHASIZED CONCERN </p><p>OVER THE GOC\'S FORCED REPATRIATION PLAN, THE CONTINUED </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES IN THE KRAJINA REGION, AND DISCUSSED </p><p>THE VOJNIC REFUGEE SITUATION.  SHATTUCK ALSO ENCOURAGED </p><p>MORE PUBLIC STATEMENTS ABOUT THE RIGHT OF RETURN OF ETHNIC </p><p>SERBS TO THEIR HOMES IN CROATIA.   IN DEFENDING CROATIA\'S </p><p>RECORD, JARNJAK CITED EXAMPLES OF CROATIAN SUPPORT FOR </p><p>REFUGEES, PURSUIT OF PERPETRATORS OF CRIMINAL ACTS IN THE </p><p>KRAJINA, AND COOPERATION WITH THE INTERNATIONAL WAR CRIMES </p><p>COMMISSION.  HE ALSO AGREED TO PRESS FOR MORE PUBLIC </p><p>STATEMENTS ON RIGHTS OF REFUGEES TO RETURN AND TO RECLAIM </p><p>PROPERTY.  COMMENT. JARNJAK MADE AN UNCONVINCING CASE. END </p><p>COMMENT. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  ASSISTANT SECRETARY SHATTUCK MET WITH CROATIAN </p><p>INTERIOR MINISTER IVAN JARNJAK AT THE MINISTRY ON </p><p>SEPTEMBER 30.  THE MINISTER WAS ACCOMPANIED BY HIS </p><p>ASSISTANTS MARIJAN BENKO FOR POLICE AFFAIRS AND ZDRAVKO </p><p>ZIDOVEC FOR CIVIL AFFAIRS, PLUS THE HEAD OF THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS DEPARTMENT DR. JOSIP BESIC.  DRL </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  03925  01 OF 03  061729Z </p><p>STEVE COFFEY AND DCM (NOTETAKER) ACCOMPANIED MR. SHATTUCK. </p><p> </p><p>4.  SHATTUCK DREW ON REFTEL DEMARCHE IN EXPRESSING USG </p><p>CONCERN OVER THE GOC PLAN TO REPATRIATE REFUGEES AND </p><p>STRESSED THAT THE 1951 CONVENTION ON THE STATUS OF </p><p>REFUGEES PRECLUDES FORCED REPATRIATION. AT THE SAME TIME, </p><p>HE ACKNOWLEDGED THE BURDEN THAT CROATIA HAS FACED IN </p><p>CARING FOR REFUGEES, BUT STRESSED U.S. CONCERN THAT </p><p>UNILATERAL ABROGATION OF REFUGEE STATUS WAS A VIOLATION OF </p><p>THE 1951 CONVENTION. </p><p> </p><p>5.  JARNYAK REPLIED THAT CROATIA HOLDS HUMAN RIGHTS ABOVE </p><p>POLITICS AND OTHER MATTERS, BUT THAT HE WAS NOT IN A </p><p>POSITION TO DISCUSS THE REPATRIATION ISSUE BECAUSE IT IS </p><p>THE RESPONSIBILITY OF MR. ADALBERT REBIC, HEAD OF THE </p><p>OFFICE FOR DISPLACED PERSONS AND REFUGEES.  HE COULD ONLY </p><p>STATE IN GENERAL AND AS A RULE THAT NO PEOPLE ARE FORCED </p><p>TO RETURN TO AREAS NOT CONSIDERED SAFE. </p><p> </p><p>6.  SHATTUCK RAISED THE ISSUE OF THE RIGHT OF RETURN FOR </p><p>CROATIAN SERB REFUGEES.  SUCH PEOPLE SEEKING TO RETURN </p><p>HAVE BEEN FACING IMPEDIMENTS.  IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO HAVE </p><p>MORE PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN CROATIA REGARDING THE RIGHT OF </p><p>SERBS TO RETURN, BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT IMPEDIMENT IS THE </p><p>CLIMATE OF INSINCERITY.  SHATTUCK ALSO NOTED NUMEROUS </p><p>REPORTS THAT KILLING, BURNING AND LOOTING CONTINUES AND </p><p>THE AMPLE EVIDENCE OF DESTRUCTION HE SAW IN HIS TRAVELS </p><p>THROUGH THE NEWLY LIBERATED AREAS. </p><p> </p><p>7.  SHATTUCK MENTIONED THAT FONMIN GRANIC SAID THE </p><p>CROATIAN GOVERNMENT WOULD WELCOME THE RETURN OF SERBS VERY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  03925  01 OF 03  061729Z </p><p>MUCH AND THAT THE GOVERNMENT WOULD INVESTIGATE ABUSES IF </p><p>THEY WERE BROUGHT TO THEIR ATTENTION.  HE URGED JARNJAK TO </p><p>TAKE THE INITIATIVE AND INVESTIGATE THE CAUSES OF THE </p><p>LOOTING, BURNING AND KILLING. </p><p> </p><p>8.  JARNJAK SAID THE REFUGEES HAVE BEEN RETURNING ONLY </p><p>WHEN THEY FEEL SAFE.  HE POINTED OUT THAT IN THE WAR </p><p>BETWEEN MUSLIMS AND CROATS IN BOSNIA IN 1991, CROATIA HAD </p><p>100,000 MUSLIMS HERE AND THE CROATIAN POLICE PROTECTED </p><p>THOSE REFUGEES.  AS FOR THE CROATIAN SERB REFUGEES, THEIR </p><p>SAFETY IS FULLY GUARANTEED ACCORDING TO CROATIAN LAW AS </p><p>LONG AS THEY ARE CITIZENS OF CROATIA.  IF THEY WISH THEY </p><p>CAN RETURN.  THERE IS ONE REQUIREMENT:  THEY HAVE TO </p><p>REPORT THEIR DESIRE TO RETURN TO THE CROATIAN OFFICE IN </p><p>BELGRADE.  (COMMENT. THERE IS ONE CLERK TO PROCESS ALL </p><p>APPLICATIONS FOR RETURN IN BELGRADE. END COMMENT) </p><p> </p><p>9. THE GOVERNMENT HAD NO INFORMATION SO HAD NO WAY OF </p><p>KNOWING THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD LIKE TO RETURN, </p><p>JARNJAK CLAIMED.  HE ALSO ASSERTED THAT ALL THOSE WHO COME </p><p>TO THE BORDER OR BORDER POINTS ARE ALLOWED TO ENTER INTO </p><p>CROATIA.  ONLY ONE OR TWO HUNDRED HAVE COME THIS WAY. </p><p>(COMMENT. NOT ACCORDING TO EYEWITNESS REPORTS BY PRESS AND </p><p>EMBASSY PERSONNEL, WHO SAY SERBS AND MUSLIMS ARE NOT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NNNNPTQ8479 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ8479 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  03925  02 OF 03  061729Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-01 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   AMAD-01  CIAE-00  SMEC-00  INL-01   OASY-00 </p><p>      DINT-00  DODE-00  DOEE-00  ANHR-01  SRPP-00  EB-01    OIGO-01 </p><p>      FBIE-00  INLB-01  H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01 </p><p>      L-01     ADS-00   M-00     NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01 </p><p>      PA-01    PM-00    PRS-01   P-00     SCT-00   SP-00    SSO-00 </p><p>      SS-00    STR-01   TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00  SNIS-00  NISC-01 </p><p>      PMB-00   PRM-10   PRME-01  PRMC-01  DRL-09   G-00       /038W </p><p>                  ------------------F42C7C  061730Z /38 </p><p>O 061726Z OCT 95 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 7528 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY BELGRADE </p><p>NATO EU COLLECTIVE </p><p>AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>AMEMBASSY LONDON </p><p>AMEMBASSY MOSCOW </p><p>USMISSION USNATO </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA </p><p>AMEMBASSY SARAJEVO </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p>USLO SKOPJE </p><p>AMEMBASSY LJUBLJANA </p><p>AMEMBASSY BUDAPEST </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 ZAGREB 003925 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE PLEASE PASS NSC </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  03925  02 OF 03  061729Z </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: 9/30/10 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PREF, HR </p><p>SUBJECT:  A/S SHATTUCK\'S 9/30 MEETING WITH INTERIOR </p><p>          MINISTER </p><p> </p><p>ALLOWED INTO CROATIA. END COMMENT) </p><p> </p><p>10. THE BIGGEST PROBLEM IS THAT PEOPLE LIVING IN SERBIA OR </p><p>BOSNIA HAVE NO INFORMATION ABOUT THE GOC\'S WILLINGNESS TO </p><p>RECEIVE THEM BACK BECAUSE CROATIAN MEDIA IS INACCESSIBLE </p><p>TO THEM. COMMENT. SERBIAN RADIO AND TELEVISION ARE READILY </p><p>AVAILABLE IN CROATIA; THE CONVERSE IS PRESUMABLY TRUE AS </p><p>WELL. END COMMENT.  THE MINISTER SAID THE GOC MADE AN </p><p>APPEAL EVERY HOUR WHEN THE KRAJINA OPERATION BEGAN; NOW IT </p><p>IS IMPOSSIBLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE REFUGEES.  HE NOTED </p><p>THAT THE INHABITANTS OF SECTOR NORTH AND SOUTH LEFT IN AN </p><p>EXODUS COORDINATED BY THEIR OWN CIVIL AND MILITARY </p><p>AUTHORITIES. </p><p> </p><p>11.  THE MINISTER MAINTAINED THAT THE GOVERNMENT LOOKED </p><p>INTO EVERY CASE OF BURNING, LOOTING OR KILLING AND HIS </p><p>ASSISTANT FOR POLICE AFFAIRS MR. BENKO HAD DOSSIERS </p><p>AVAILABLE FOR INSPECTION.  HE ADMITTED THERE HAD BEEN </p><p>INDIVIDUAL CASES OF HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS.  HE NOTED </p><p>THAT CROATIA HAS COOPERATED WITH THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>TRIBUNAL IN THE HAGUE AND RECEIVED LETTERS OF GRATITUDE </p><p>FROM THEM.  THE SPECIAL SERVICE ACTIVE WITH WAR CRIMES AND </p><p>TERRORISM HAS BEEN WORKING IN CROATIA SINCE 1991. </p><p> </p><p>12.  SHATTUCK RAISED THE RECLAIMING OF PROPERTY ISSUE, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  03925  02 OF 03  061729Z </p><p>STRESSING THAT THE EXISTING PROCEDURES WERE EXTREMELY </p><p>DIFFICULT FOR THE CROATIAN SERB REFUGEES TO BE ABLE TO </p><p>COMPLY.  THE CITIZENS WHO WANT TO RECLAIM THEIR PROPERTY </p><p>MUST HAVE DOCUMENTS AND PERMANENTLY RESIDE IN CROATIA.  IT </p><p>IS DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN THESE DOCUMENTS OUTSIDE OF CROATIA </p><p>AND DIFFICULT FOR THE REFUGEES TO GET BACK INTO CROATIA. </p><p>IN ADDITION, IN MANY CASES THE PROPERTY HAS BEEN </p><p>DESTROYED.  IN SUMMARY, IT APPEARS THAT DE FACTO THE </p><p>PROPERTY HAS BEEN CONFISCATED.  MAYBE THAT IS NOT THE </p><p>INTENT, BUT THAT IS THE EFFECT. </p><p> </p><p>13.  THE DIRECTIVE ON PROPERTY, ACCORDING TO JARNJAK, IS </p><p>INTENDED TO PROTECT PRIVATE PROPERTY FROM FURTHER </p><p>DESTRUCTION BY MAKING CROATIA THE TEMPORARY OWNER.  THE </p><p>CROATIAN LAW ON PROPERTY RIGHTS PROVIDES FOR THE RETURN OF </p><p>THE PROPERTY AS SOON AS ITS LEGAL OWNERS RETURN. THE </p><p>PROPERTY OF THOSE WHO DECIDE NOT TO RETURN WILL BE </p><p>UTILIZED FOR THOSE IN NEED, SUCH AS REFUGEES.  THE </p><p>PROPERTY IS NOT GIVEN PERMANENTLY, ONLY PROVIDED FOR USE. </p><p>(COMMENT: THE TITO GOVERNMENT EXPROPRIATED THOUSANDS OF </p><p>PROPERTIES WHEN IT CAME INTO POWER, AND MANY ORIGINAL </p><p>OWNERS ARE NOW IN LITIGATION WITH THE GOVERNMENT TO OBTAIN </p><p>THEIR RETURN. END COMMENT) </p><p> </p><p>14.  A/S SHATTUCK NOTED HE HAD PERSONALLY VISITED THE </p><p>VOJNIC REFUGEES.  HE POINTED OUT THAT THERE WILL BE A </p><p>HUMANITARIAN CRISIS IN THE WINTER, BUT THERE IS AN </p><p>IMMEDIATE CRISIS OF SANITATION.  ONE SOLUTION WOULD BE TO </p><p>MOVE THE REFUGEES TO HIGHER GROUND.  IT WOULD BE HELPFUL </p><p>IF THE GOC WORKED WITH UNHCR AND ICRC ON THIS MATTER. </p><p>THERE IS ALSO A SECURITY PROBLEM IN THE CAMP.   IT IS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  03925  02 OF 03  061729Z </p><p>BECOMING INCREASINGLY DANGEROUS, WITH REPORTS OF VIOLENCE </p><p>AND THAT THE MILITARY ARE TAKING YOUNG MEN. </p><p> </p><p>15.  THIS CAMP IS A LARGE AND SERIOUS PROBLEM, ACCORDING </p><p>TO JARNJAK.  THE INTERIOR MINISTERS OF TURKEY, B-H AND </p><p>CROATIA WILL MEET NEXT WEEK.  THERE WILL BE A THREE PART </p><p>POLICE WITH THE PURPOSE OF PROTECTING THE PEOPLE IN SUCH A </p><p>WAY THAT THEY CAN RETURN TO VELIKA KLADUSA.  JARNJAK SAID </p><p>HE HOPED IN THIS WAY TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM POSITIVELY. </p><p>HOWEVER, THERE WILL BE NO FORCIBLE RETURN  THE GOC WILL </p><p>SEEK A SOLUTION FOR THOSE WHO DO NOT WISH TO RETURN. </p><p>JARNJAK ADDED THAT THE CROATIAN GOVERNMENT WOULD NOT MAKE </p><p>ANY PERSON RETURN TO A POSITION WHERE HE COULD NOT LIVE </p><p>SAFELY AND IN PEACE.  "IF I HADN\'T BEEN OF THIS </p><p>OPINION. WE WOULD NOT HAVE LET THEM COME TO CROATIA." </p><p>(COMMENT. EMBASSY IS REPORTING SEPARATELY ON FORCIBLE </p><p>RETURN OF CROATIANS TO BOSNIA. END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>16.  A/S SHATTUCK SAID HE APPRECIATED THE COOPERATION </p><p>BETWEEN CROATIA AND THE WAR CRIMES COMMISSION, AND </p><p>STRESSED THAT IT IS VERY IMPORTANT. </p><p> </p><p>17. A/S SHATTUCK SUGGESTED THAT JARNJAK ASK THE PRESIDENT </p><p>TO MAKE A STATEMENT, BECAUSE THE SIGNAL THAT IS NOW BEING </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NNNNPTQ8480 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ8480 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  03925  03 OF 03  061730Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-01 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   AMAD-01  CIAE-00  SMEC-00  INL-01   OASY-00 </p><p>      DINT-00  DODE-00  DOEE-00  ANHR-01  SRPP-00  EB-01    OIGO-01 </p><p>      FBIE-00  INLB-01  H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01 </p><p>      L-01     ADS-00   M-00     NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01 </p><p>      PA-01    PM-00    PRS-01   P-00     SCT-00   SP-00    SSO-00 </p><p>      SS-00    STR-01   TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00  SNIS-00  NISC-01 </p><p>      PMB-00   PRM-10   PRME-01  PRMC-01  DRL-09   G-00       /038W </p><p>                  ------------------F42C80  061730Z /38 </p><p>O 061726Z OCT 95 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 7529 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY BELGRADE </p><p>NATO EU COLLECTIVE </p><p>AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>AMEMBASSY LONDON </p><p>AMEMBASSY MOSCOW </p><p>USMISSION USNATO </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA </p><p>AMEMBASSY SARAJEVO </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p>USLO SKOPJE </p><p>AMEMBASSY LJUBLJANA </p><p>AMEMBASSY BUDAPEST </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 ZAGREB 003925 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE PLEASE PASS NSC </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  03925  03 OF 03  061730Z </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: 9/30/10 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PREF, HR </p><p>SUBJECT:  A/S SHATTUCK\'S 9/30 MEETING WITH INTERIOR </p><p>          MINISTER </p><p> </p><p>GIVEN IS THAT SERBS ARE NOT WELCOME.  JARNJAK SAID BOTH </p><p>TUDJMAN AND THE PRIME MINISTER HAVE SPOKEN TWICE ON THIS </p><p>ISSUE, BUT THAT HE WOULD SUGGEST THAT THE PRESIDENT </p><p>ADDRESS IT AGAIN IN HIS NEXT PRESS CONFERENCE, THE </p><p>PROBLEM, HE REPEATED, IS THAT THE NEWS WOULD ONLY BE HEARD </p><p>DOMESTICALLY AND NOT REACH THE REFUGEES.  ANOTHER PROBLEM, </p><p>HE ADDED, IS THAT THE THE SERBS CONSIDER IT AN ADVANTAGE </p><p>FOR THEM TO HAVE THE REFUGEES.  THEY WOULD USE THEM TO </p><p>ALTER THE ETHNIC BALANCE IN KOSOVO AND DID NOT WISH THEIR </p><p>RETURN TO CROATIA. </p><p> </p><p>18. NOT ALL THE REFUGEES ARE GOING TO KOSOVO, SHATTUCK </p><p>REPLIED.  HE NOTED THAT HE SPOKEN TO THE SERBS ABOUT THE </p><p>DESTRUCTION OF VUKOVAR A YEAR AGO AND EARLIER CONDEMNED </p><p>THE MASS KILLINGS IN NORTHEAST BOSNIA.  HE WISHED THE </p><p>MINISTER TO KNOW HIS INTEREST WAS HUMAN RIGHTS.
