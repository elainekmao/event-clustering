<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 ISLAMABAD 002533 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR SA/PAB AND EUR/CEN; LONDON FOR POL/TUELLER; PARIS FOR </p><p>POL/RAVELING; ROME FOR POL/DEMPSEY; MBABANE FOR MALINOWSKI </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  3/28/07 </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, KISL, PREL, PINR, AF </p><p>SUBJECT:  AFGHANISTAN:  THE ENIGMATIC MULLAH OMAR AND TALIBAN </p><p>DECISION-MAKING </p><p> </p><p>REFS:  (A) ISLAMABAD 2488 </p><p>       (B) 96 ISLAMABAD 10540 </p><p>       (C) 96 PESHAWAR 926 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) CLASSIFIED BY JOHN C. HOLZMAN, DEPUTY CHIEF OF MISSION. </p><p>REASON:  1.5 (C) (D). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) THIS CABLE WAS COORDINATED WITH CONSULATE PESHAWAR. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) NOT MUCH IS KNOWN ABOUT MULLAH OMAR, THE TALIBAN FOUNDER </p><p>AND LEADER.  HE COMES FROM A SMALL VILLAGE NEAR KANDAHAR AND HIS </p><p>FAMILY, WHILE RESPECTED, DID NOT BELONG TO THE AFGHAN ELITE.  A </p><p>SMALL-TIME COMMANDER IN THE AFGHAN RESISTANCE, HE FORMED THE </p><p>TALIBAN IN LATE 1994 AS A REACTION AGAINST "IMMORAL" LOCAL </p><p>COMMANDERS.  HE RARELY APPEARS IN PUBLIC AND DOES NOT MEET WITH </p><p>MANY NON-MUSLIMS.  THOSE WHO HAVE MET HIM SAY HE IS A MAN OF FEW </p><p>WORDS AND LIVES IN SPARTAN SURROUNDINGS.   ALTHOUGH HIS POLITICAL </p><p>BELIEFS ARE OBSCURE, MOST OBSERVERS AGREE THAT OMAR PLAYS THE KEY, </p><p>AND PROBABLY DECISIVE, ROLE IN TALIBAN DECISION-MAKING. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>NOT MUCH BIO-DATA </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) SHORTLY AFTER THE TALIBAN SEIZED KABUL IN SEPTEMBER 1996, </p><p>THE TALIBAN MOVEMENT ANNOUNCED THAT MULLAH MOHAMMAD OMAR, THE </p><p>TALIBAN FOUNDER AND LEADER, WOULD SERVE AS THE HEAD OF THEIR </p><p>"ISLAMIC STATE OF AFGHANISTAN."  IN THIS CAPACITY, HIS TITLE </p><p>REMAINS "AMIR AL-MU\'MININ" ("COMMANDER OF THE FAITHFUL"), WHICH A </p><p>TALIBAN-CONVENED GROUP OF RELIGIOUS LEADERS CONFERRED ON HIM IN </p><p>APRIL 1996 IN KANDAHAR CITY.  OMAR, WHO IS APPROXIMATELY 38, IS </p><p>FROM THE MAIWAND DISTRICT OF KANDAHAR PROVINCE AND IS A MEMBER OF </p><p>THE HOTAK SUB-TRIBE OF THE GHILZAI TRIBE (REF C).  OMAR WAS A </p><p>RELATIVELY UNKNOWN COMMANDER IN THE AFGHAN-SOVIET WAR, WHO </p><p>MAINTAINED AFFILIATIONS WITH HEZB-I-ISLAMI (KHALIS) AND HARAKAT-I- </p><p>INQILAB-ISLAMI (MOHAMMEDI).  HE LOST HIS RIGHT EYE IN THE WAR. </p><p>AFTER THE FALL OF THE COMMUNIST REGIME IN 1992, OMAR, WHO </p><p>REPORTEDLY HAS TWO WIVES, RETURNED TO A MADRASSA, WHICH HE HAD </p><p>ATTENDED IN HIS YOUTH, IN HIS HOME VILLAGE OF SANGASAR, NEAR </p><p>KANDAHAR CITY.  IT WAS FROM THIS VILLAGE THAT MULLAH OMAR AND </p><p>FELLOW TALIBS, ANGERED ABOUT THE "IMMORAL BEHAVIOR" OF LOCAL </p><p>COMMANDERS, BEGAN THE TALIBAN MOVEMENT IN THE FALL OF 1994. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) ASKED ABOUT OMAR\'S BACKGROUND, HAMID KARZAI, THE DEPUTY </p><p>LEADER OF THE LARGE POPALZAI TRIBE, TOLD POLOFF MARCH 22 THAT OMAR </p><p>CAME FROM A FAMILY LOCALLY RESPECTED FOR ITS RELIGIOUS PIETY, BUT </p><p>NOT INVOLVED IN POLITICS:  "OMAR\'S FATHER WAS A LOCAL RELIGIOUS </p><p>LEADER, BUT THE FAMILY WAS POOR AND HAD ABSOLUTELY NO POLITICAL </p><p>LINKS IN KANDAHAR OR KABUL.  THEY WERE ESSENTIALLY LOWER MIDDLE </p><p>CLASS AFGHANS AND WERE DEFINITELY NOT MEMBERS OF THE ELITE." </p><p>AGREEING WITH KARZAI\'S ASSESSMENT, HAMED GAILANI, SON OF PIR </p><p>GAILANI AND A LEADER OF THE SMALL NATIONAL ISLAMIC FRONT OF </p><p>AFGHANISTAN (NIFA), TOLD POLOFF MARCH 23 THAT "OMAR IS ADMIRED BY </p><p>THE TALIBAN FOR THREE REASONS:  HIS RELIGIOUS PIETY, HIS REPUTATION </p><p>FOR INCORRUPTIBILITY, AND HIS BRAVERY IN THE JIHAD.  BECAUSE OF </p><p>THESE QUALITIES, HE IS CONSIDERED LIKE A TEACHER, A GUIDE." </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>FEW PUBLIC APPEARANCES </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) MULLAH MOHAMMAD OMAR IS RARELY SEEN IN PUBLIC.  ONE OF THE </p><p>FEW TIMES HE HAS MADE A PUBLIC APPEARANCE WAS IN APRIL, 1996, WHEN </p><p>HE ACCEPTED THE AMIR AL-MU\'MININ TITLE AND HELD THE "CLOAK OF THE </p><p>PROPHET" (A KANDAHARI RELIC) IN FRONT OF A CROWD.  HE ALSO </p><p>PERSONALLY INAUGURATED A TALIBAN-SPONSORED REFURBISHMENT OF THE </p><p>MAUSOLEUM OF AHMAD SHAH DURRANI IN KANDAHAR.  WHETHER HE CHOOSES TO </p><p>REMAIN SHROUDED IN SECRECY OR IS A GENUINE RECLUSE IS NOT CLEAR, </p><p>BUT MULLAH MALANG, A FORMER RESISTANCE COMMANDER WHO KNOWS MANY OF </p><p>THE TALIBAN LEADERS, TOLD POLOFF ON MARCH 26 THAT MULLAH OMAR HAS </p><p>NO DESIRE TO DEVELOP A PUBLIC PERSONALITY:  "WHAT YOU MUST REALIZE </p><p>IS THAT OMAR IS TOTALLY INNER-DIRECTED.  HIS LEGITIMACY COMES FROM </p><p>GOD AND NOT FROM THE PUBLIC; BECAUSE OF THIS, HE FEELS NO NEED TO </p><p>EMERGE FROM HIS CHAMBERS. IN ADDITION, HE DOES NOT WANT TO MEET </p><p>ANYONE WHO MAY DIVERT HIM FROM HIS CHOSEN COURSE." </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>A RELUCTANCE TO MEET NON-MUSLIMS </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) MALANG\'S REMARKS HIGHLIGHT ONE OF THE PROBLEMS IN TRYING TO </p><p>GET TO KNOW MULLAH OMAR:  HE DOES NOT MEET MANY NON-MUSLIMS.  TO </p><p>OUR KNOWLEDGE, HE HAS MET WITH NON-MUSLIMS ONLY TWO TIMES:  HE MET </p><p>UNICEF AFGHAN REPRESENTATIVE JIM MOHAN IN 1996 FOR APPROXIMATELY 15 </p><p>MINUTES, AND AGAIN IN 1996 HE MET (BRIEFLY) WITH A RUSSIAN </p><p>DELEGATION SEEKING THE RELEASE OF MEMBERS OF A RUSSIAN AIRCREW </p><p>WHICH WAS CAPTURED AND DETAINED BY THE TALIBAN FROM 1995 TO 1996. </p><p>FRANCIS OKELO, THE DEPUTY HEAD OF THE UN SPECIAL MISSION FOR </p><p>AFGHANISTAN (UNSMA), TOLD POLOFF MARCH 21 THAT UN SPECIAL ENVOY </p><p>HOLL (A NON-MUSLIM GERMAN) HAS REQUESTED MEETINGS WITH OMAR ON </p><p>SEVERAL OCCASIONS AND BEEN TURNED DOWN EVERY TIME.  ASKED WHETHER </p><p>THE UNSMA HAD EVER RECEIVED AN EXPLANATION FROM THE TALIBAN, OKELO </p><p>REPLIED THAT "THEY BASICALLY TELL US THAT HE IS ALWAYS BUSY AND </p><p>INTIMATE THAT HE DOES NOT LIKE TO MEET WITH NON-MUSLIMS."  IN </p><p>ADDITION, UNOCHA COORDINATOR ALFREDO WITSCHI-CESTARI (A NON-MUSLIM) </p><p>RECENTLY EXPRESSED OPTIMISM TO THE DCM THAT HIS REQUEST TO MEET </p><p>WITH OMAR IN KANDAHAR TO EXPLAIN UN HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE/ </p><p>DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS WOULD BE GRANTED.  (COMMENT:  THIS REMAINS TO </p><p>BE SEEN.) </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>A MAN OF FEW WORDS </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) THOSE WHO HAVE MET MULLAH OMAR REMARK THAT HE IS A MAN OF </p><p>DECIDEDLY FEW WORDS, AND ONE WHO KEEPS TO SIMPLE SURROUNDINGS.  ON </p><p>MARCH 21, IBRAHIM BAKR, THE OIC SPECIAL ENVOY FOR AFGHANISTAN, TOLD </p><p>DCM THAT HE HAD MET OMAR ON MARCH 15 TO REQUEST LENIENCE FOR TWO </p><p>JAILED FRENCHMEN HELD IN KABUL BY THE TALIBAN ON VAGUE CHARGES OF </p><p>IMMORALITY.  (NOTE:  AFTER A BRIEF TRIAL, THE FRENCHMEN WERE </p><p>RELEASED ON MARCH 19.)  BAKR DESCRIBED THE MEETING:  "I EXPLAINED </p><p>WHY I THOUGHT THE FRENCHMEN SHOULD BE RELEASED AND AT THE END OF MY </p><p>COMMENTS MULLAH OMAR SAID \'THANK YOU.  WE WILL CONSIDER THAT.\'" </p><p>BAKR ADDED THAT OMAR\'S OFFICE (WHICH APPARENTLY DOUBLED AS HIS </p><p>BEDROOM) WAS SPARSE AND DIMLY LIT.  THE ONLY FURNITURE WAS A </p><p>CHARPOY (SIMPLE WOODEN BED) AND A WARDROBE.  GUESTS SAT ON THE </p><p>FLOOR, LOOKING UP AT OMAR, WHO SAT ON THE CHARPOY.  ANOTHER PERSON </p><p>WHO MET OMAR, IFTIKHAR MURSHED, ADDITIONAL SECRETARY (AFGHANISTAN) </p><p>AT THE PAKISTANI MFA, TOLD US DECEMBER 15 THAT, DURING A DECEMBER </p><p>8 DELEGATION VISIT TO KANDAHAR, A PAKISTANI DELEGATION MET OMAR AND </p><p>IN THAT MEETING "THE PAKISTANIS SPOKE FOR THE FIRST 85 MINUTES AND </p><p>OMAR FOR THE LAST FIVE."   IN THIS MEETING (REF B), MURSHED </p><p>RECOUNTED THAT THE GIST OF OMAR\'S COMMENTS WERE, "I AM VERY GLAD </p><p>YOU HAVE COME; I HAVE LISTENED VERY CAREFULLY."  (NOTE:  MURSHED </p><p>HAS ALSO TOLD DCM THAT THE PAKISTANI CONSUL GENERAL IN KANDAHAR HAS </p><p>EASY ACCESS TO OMAR.")  IN DESCRIBING HIS MEETING WITH OMAR, UNICEF </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE MOHAN SAID HE DID ALL THE SPEAKING AND RECEIVED </p><p>LITTLE REACTION FROM OMAR. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>POLITICAL BELIEFS ARE OBSCURE </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) THE LIMITED ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE AVAILABLE PROVIDES LITTLE </p><p>INFORMATION ON MULLAH OMAR\'S PERSONAL POLITICAL BELIEFS.  MOST </p><p>OBSERVERS DO NOT THINK THAT HE IS AN "IKHWANI" OR "FUNDAMENTALIST </p><p>MUSLIM" IN THE CLASSIC MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD SENSE.  IN A MARCH 20 </p><p>CONVERSATION, DR. GHAIRAT BAHEER, THE ISLAMABAD REPRESENTATIVE FOR </p><p>HEZB-I-ISLAMI AND SON-IN-LAW OF ISLAMIC RADICAL GULBUDDIN </p><p>HEKMATYAR, COMMENTED THAT "OMAR IS TOO POORLY EDUCATED IN ISLAMIC </p><p>PRINCIPLES TO BE AN IKHWANI; HE IS BASICALLY A FERVENT MUSLIM WITH </p><p>OBSCURANTIST TENDENCIES WHOSE VIEWS ARE STRONGLY AFFECTED BY HIS </p><p>TRIBAL BACKGROUND."  INDEED, THERE IS LITTLE EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST </p><p>THAT MULLAH OMAR IS AN ISLAMIC RADICAL WITH AN ANTI-WESTERN AGENDA. </p><p>HE HAS NOT BEEN KNOWN TO MAKE ANTI-WESTERN STATEMENTS, ALTHOUGH HE </p><p>IS KNOWN TO BE ANTI-RUSSIAN BECAUSE OF THE AFGHAN-SOVIET WAR. </p><p>HOWEVER, WE RECENTLY HEARD ONE COMMENT THAT INDICATES THAT OMAR MAY </p><p>HAVE SOME ANTAGONISM TOWARD THE WEST:  ABDUL HADI, THE TALIBAN </p><p>DEPUTY GOVERNOR OF ZABUL PROVINCE AND THEIR (SELF-DESCRIBED) CHOICE </p><p>FOR GOVERNOR OF WARDAK PROVINCE, TOLD DCM ON MARCH 17 THAT HE HAD </p><p>ATTENDED A MEETING MARCH 1 IN WHICH OMAR HAD DEFENDED THE TALIBAN\'S </p><p>RELATIONSHIP WITH FUGITIVE SAUDI FINANCIER BIN LADEN -- "OMAR TOLD </p><p>US THAT WE HAVE TO HELP BIN LADEN BECAUSE HE IS A GOOD, ISLAMIC </p><p>PERSON, WHO IS FIGHTING THE KAFFIRS (UNBELIEVERS)."  (NOTE:  SEE </p><p>REF A ON A MARCH 25 MEETING BETWEEN OMAR AND FUGITIVE EX-SAUDI </p><p>FINANCIER OSAMA BIN LADEN.) </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>TALIBAN DECISION-MAKING:  OMAR AND THE SHURA </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) MOST OBSERVERS BELIEVE THAT OMAR HAS A KEY, AND PROBABLY </p><p>DECISIVE, ROLE IN TALIBAN DECISION-MAKING.  THEY NOTE, FOR EXAMPLE, </p><p>THAT VIRUALLY EVERY IMPORTANT TALIBAN EDICT ON SOCIAL ISSUES OR THE </p><p>MILITARY SITUATION COMES OUT IN HIS NAME.  IN ADDITION, HE </p><p>REPORTEDLY MAKES HIGH-LEVEL PERSONNEL DECISIONS.  TAYYAB HUSSAINI, </p><p>A SECOND SECRETARY AT THE AFGHAN EMBASSY AND A TALIB, TOLD POLOFF </p><p>ON MARCH 14 THAT "THE AMIR AL-MU\'MININ HAS TOTAL CONTROL OF </p><p>PERSONNEL DECISIONS.  OF COURSE, HE MAKES THESE DECISIONS IN </p><p>CONSULTATION WITH OTHER SHURA MEMBERS."  POLOFF ASKED HUSSAINI </p><p>ABOUT THE PRECISE NATURE OF OMAR\'S RELATIONSHIP WITH MEMBERS OF THE </p><p>SHURA.  IN RESPONSE, HUSSAINI OBSERVED THAT POLICY DECISIONS ARE </p><p>MADE IN KANDAHAR AND IMPLEMENTED BY THE "CARETAKER COUNCIL" IN </p><p>KABUL, WHICH GIVES ORDERS TO TALIBAN PROVINCIAL CHIEFS.  SOMEWHAT </p><p>CONFUSINGLY, HE THEN ADDED THAT BEFORE MAKING DECISIONS OMAR </p><p>CONSULTS CLOSELY WITH MULLAH RABBANI, THE HEAD OF THE "CARETAKER </p><p>COUNCIL" AND MULLAH HASSAN, THE DEPUTY HEAD OF THE "CARETAKER </p><p>COUNCIL."  (FORMER COMMANDER RAHIM WARDAK, IN A RECENT CONVERSATION </p><p>WITH THE DCM, ALSO INDICATED THAT OMAR CONSULTS WIDELY AMONG SENIOR </p><p>TALIBAN OFFICIALS; HOWEVER, AFTER HEARING VARIOUS VIEWPOINTS, OMAR </p><p>SOMETIMES COMES UP WITH A DECISION COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM ANY OF </p><p>THE EXPRESSED VIEWS AND THEN EXPECTS IMPLEMENTATION.  BASED ON </p><p>WARDAK\'S COMMENTS, ONE COULD CONCLUDE THAT OMAR WAS A BIT OF A </p><p>"CONTROL FREAK.")  HIROSHI TAKAHASHI, AN UNSMA POLITICAL OFFICER, </p><p>TOLD POLOFF ON MARCH 5 THAT HE THOUGHT THAT TWO OTHER KEY ADVISERS </p><p>FOR OMAR ARE ANOTHER MULLAH HASSAN, THE GOVERNOR OF KANDAHAR AND </p><p>FOUR NEIGHBORING PROVINCES, AND MULLAH JALIL, A TALIBAN "DEPUTY </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER," WHO IS STATIONED IN KANDAHAR. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) WHILE REPORTS VARY OF HOW WILLING OR RELUCTANT MULLAH OMAR </p><p>WAS TO ACCEPT THE TITLE "AMIR AL-MU\'MININ" FROM THE ASSEMBLED </p><p>TALIBAN IN KANDAHAR IN APRIL 1996, NEVERTHELESS HE DID ACCEPT IT. </p><p>CREATED EARLY IN ISLAMIC HISTORY AND FIRST USED BY THE SECOND OF </p><p>THE ORTHODOX CALIPHS, OMAR, THE TITLE HAS BEEN ADOPTED BY A SERIES </p><p>OF MUSLIM POLITIES UP TO THE PRESENT DAY.  IN THE SUNNI ISLAMIC </p><p>WORLD, THE ADOPTION OF THE TITLE IMPLIED THE CLAIM EITHER TO THE </p><p>CALIPHATE OR TO AUTONOMOUS POLITICAL AUTHORITY OVER A REGION OF THE </p><p>ISLAMIC WORLD.  NOT EVEN THE MOST IDEOLOGICAL TALIBAN CLAIM THAT </p><p>OMAR WITH HIS TITLE IS A SUCCESSOR TO THE CALIPHATE, MOST RECENTLY </p><p>HELD IN OTTOMAN TURKEY.  BUT, IN THE SECOND SENSE, THE TALIBAN ARE </p><p>MOST CERTAINLY CLAIMING AUTHORITY OVER THE AFGHAN REGION OF THE </p><p>ISLAMIC WORLD.  OMAR BUTTRESSED THIS CLAIM BY DISPLAYING "THE CLOAK </p><p>OF THE PROPHET" WHEN HE ASSUMED THE TITLE OF AMIR AL-MU\'MININ. </p><p>ALSO, IN MORE RECENT HISTORY, THE TITLE HAS HAD A STRONG </p><p>IDEOLOGICAL RESONANCE AMONG SOME REFORMIST, MESSIANIC, AND MILITANT </p><p>ISLAMIC MOVEMENTS, RESPONDING TO WHAT THEY PERCEIVE AS THE CORRUPT </p><p>AND IRRELIGIOUS WAYS OF THE EXISTING RULERS.  BESIDES THE TALIBAN, </p><p>SOME OTHER ISLAMIC MOVEMENTS ON AFGHAN SOIL HAVE USED THIS TITLE. </p><p>FOR EXAMPLE, A WAHHABI SECT WITH STRONG ARAB BACKING, MOST ACTIVE </p><p>IN KUNAR PROVINCE, UNTIL QUITE RECENTLY CALLED ITS LEADER "AMIR </p><p>AL-MU\'MININ." </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) IN CONTRAST TO MANY OF THE HOLDERS OF THE TITLE IN </p><p>CLASSICAL ISLAM OR TO MANY OF THE LAWLESS COMMANDERS THE TALIBAN </p><p>OUSTED OR COOPTED, OMAR LIVES AUSTERELY, WITHOUT AN ELABORATE COURT </p><p>AND ENTOURAGE, AND WITHOUT THE UBIQUITOUS PAJERO\'S SO MANY </p><p>MUJAHIDIN COMMANDERS SPED AROUND THE COUNTRYSIDE IN.  WHETHER </p><p>OMAR\'S ASCETIC LIFESTYLE IS BASED SOLELY ON HIS TEMPERAMENT OR IS </p><p>COLDLY CALCULATED TO SET HIM AND HIS MOVEMENT APART FROM THE </p><p>DISCREDITED MUJAHIDIN COMMANDERS AND LEADERS THE TALIBAN REPLACED, </p><p>MANY AFGHANS REACT APPROVINGLY.  SO FAR, NO PERSONALITY CULT OR </p><p>EMPEROR SYNDROME APPEARS TO HAVE DEVELOPED AROUND MULLAH OMAR. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C) OMAR, AS REPORTING IN OTHER CHANNELS SUGGESTS, MAY BE </p><p>ADOPTING INCREASINGLY HARDLINE ATTITUDES TOWARDS THE WEST AND </p><p>ISSUES ABOUT WHICH THE U.S. IS CONCERNED (NARCOTICS, TERRORISM). </p><p>WHAT IS MOTIVATING THIS IS DIFFICULT TO ASSESS:  GENUINE </p><p>IDEOLOGICAL CONVICTIONS, A GROWING RESENTMENT THAT THE WEST HAS NOT </p><p>ACCEPTED THE TALIBAN AS A LEGITIMATE GOVERNMENT, A BAZAAR </p><p>BARGAINING ATTITUDE, FINANCIAL AND LOGISTICAL SQUEEZES ON THE </p><p>TALIBAN, OUTSIDERS\' ADVICE, OR SOME OTHER FACTOR COULD ALL PLAY A </p><p>ROLE. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C) ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS THE EMBASSY HAS ASKED WHETHER A </p><p>MEETING WITH OMAR MIGHT BE POSSIBLE, BUT NOTHING HAS EVER COME OF </p><p>IT.  THIS IS UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE IT IS IMPORTANT THAT U.S. VIEWS </p><p>GET THROUGH TO OMAR ACCURATELY, GIVEN HIS KEY ROLE IN THE TALIBAN </p><p>DECISION-MAKING PROCESS.  AT THIS POINT, BASED ON THE TALIBAN\'S </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS RECORD AND DETERMINATION TO END THE CONFLICT BY </p><p>MILITARY MEANS, IT WOULD SEEM THAT IF HE IS HEARING OUR MESSAGE </p><p>FROM OTHER HIGH-LEVEL TALIBAN AND FROM U.S. PUBLIC STATEMENTS, HE </p><p>IS NOT LISTENING TO IT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SIMONS </p><p></p></div>
