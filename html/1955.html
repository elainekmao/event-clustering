NONE OF THEM WERE EVER </p><p>    IN DOUBT THAT THE LAND ISSUE HAD TO BE RESOLVED. </p><p>    THE PEOPLE OF ZIMBABWE HAD NEVER DISPUTED THE NEED </p><p>    FOR A LAND REFORM PROGRAM THAT WOULD REDISTRIBUTE </p><p>    LAND SO THAT THE MAJORITY, NOW CONFINED TO </p><p>    OVERCROWDED COMMUNAL AREAS, COULD OWN MOST OF IT. </p><p>    WHAT MOST CRITICS WOULD NOT ACCEPT WAS THE VIOLENCE </p><p>    ACCOMPANYING LAND </p><p>    REFORM. . .ALTHOUGH THE AGREEMENT IN ABUJA HAS BEEN </p><p>    TOUTED AS A BREAKTHROUGH, MUCH REMAINS TO BE DONE. </p><p>    THE BALL IS NOW FIRMLY IN MUGABE\'S COURT.
