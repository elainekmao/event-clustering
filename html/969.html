<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 TEL AVIV 015545 </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR NEA, NEA/IAI, AND SMEC </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR RIEDEL AND COUNTRYMAN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/20/08 </p><p>TAGS: KISL, KWBG, KPAL, PREL, PHUM, GZ, IS, PGOV </p><p>SUBJECT: HAMAS CONSIDERS A NEW MODUS VIVENDI WITH PA </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY POL/C, JOHN SCOTT, REASONS 1.5 (B/D) </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY AND COMMENT: </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) IN THE AFTERMATH OF WIDE-SCALE ARRESTS OF HAMAS </p><p>ACTIVISTS FOLLOWING THE OCTOBER 29 GUSH KATIF SUICIDE </p><p>BOMBINGS, SOME OF OUR GAZA CONTACTS ARE STATING THAT </p><p>HAMAS IS PREPARING TO ENTER INTO A LIMITED "TRUCE" WITH </p><p>THE PALESTINIAN.AUTHORITY (PA).  THE TRUCE WOULD APPLY </p><p>ONLY TO ATTACKS LAUNCHED FROM OR ON PA TERRITORY BUT </p><p>WOULD SUPPOSEDLY ALSO BIND HAMAS LEADERSHIP TO </p><p>"PERSUADING" HAMAS FUGITIVES TO TURN THEMSELVES IN UNDER </p><p>GUARANTEES OF SAFETY.  OTHER CONTACTS POINT OUT THAT </p><p>HAMAS HAS ENTERED INTO SUCH AGREEMENTS IN THE PAST AND </p><p>DISCOUNT THE EITHER THE POSSIBILITY OR THE EFFICIACY OF </p><p>A NEW AGREEMENT.  THEY ARGUE THAT EVEN IF THE LOCAL </p><p>HAMAS LEADERSHIP IS INTERESTED IN REACHING A NEW MODUS </p><p>VIVENDI WITH THE PA, THE OUTSIDE LEADERSHIP REMAINS </p><p>INTENT ON KEEPING HAMAS\' RADICAL EDGE.  THE OUTSIDE </p><p>LEADERSHIP, THEY CLAIM RETAINS THE ABILITY TO ORDER </p><p>TERRORIST OPERATIONS INSIDE OF ISRAEL AND THE PA- </p><p>CONTROLLED AREAS PRIMARILY THROUGH ITS CONTROL OF </p><p>SIGNIFICANT HAMAS FINANCIAL RESOURCES.  SIMILARLY, OUR </p><p>CONTACTS APPEAR TO BE DIVIDED OVER THE LONG-TERM AFFECTS </p><p>OF THE RECENT ARRESTS.  SOME HAVE ARGUED THAT THE </p><p>ARRESTS, WHICH MAY NUMBERED IN THE HUNDREDS, FAILED TO </p><p>INCLUDE MEMBERS OF THE SO-CALLED "MILITARY NING" AND HAD </p><p>A NEGLIBLE IMPACT OF HAMAS OPERATIONS.  OTHERS CLAIM </p><p>THAT HAMAS IS NOW IN A STATE OF INTERNAL CRISIS ARISING </p><p>FROM A LACK OF COORDINATION BETWEEN THE TWO WINGS </p><p>BECAUSE OF PA AND GOI PRESSURE, INCLUDING THE MOST </p><p>RECENT ARRESTS, AND ARGUE THAT AS A RESULT OF THE </p><p>PRESSURE, HAMAS WILL HAVE LITTLE OPTION BUT TO RESPOND </p><p>"MILITARILY." </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) PUBLIC REACTION TO THE ARRESTS AND TO CONTINUED </p><p>PA SECURITY FORCE ACTIVITIES AIMED AT HAMAS IS GENERALLY </p><p>NEGATIVE.  PUBLIC ANGER APPEARS TO BE LESS A RESULT OF </p><p>ACTUAL SUPPORT FOR HAMAS THEN OF RESENTMENT AT ARAFAT\'S </p><p>PERCEIVED WILLINGNESS TO ATTACK HAMAS IN ORDER TO PLEASE </p><p>THE U.S. AND ISRAEL.  BUT HAMAS\' ABILITY TO CAPITALIZE </p><p>ON THE RESENTMENT APPEARS FOR NOW TO BE LIMITED BY THEIR </p><p>OWN FAILURE TO IDENTIFY A CLEAR AND VIABLE ALTERNATIVE </p><p>TO ARAFAT\'S PRESENT COURSE.  END SUMMARY AND COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) ACCORDING TO PALESTINIAN MEDIA AND HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>GROUPS, PA SECURITY FORCES ARE CONTINUING TO SUMMON </p><p>SUSPECTED ISLAMIST ACTIVISTS AND TO SEARCH THEIR HOMES. </p><p>BUT POLICE ACTIVITIES APPEAR TO BE LOSING THEIR </p><p>INTENSITY AND A NUMBER OF LOWER LEVEL ACTIVISTS HAVE NOW </p><p>ALSO BEEN RELEASED.  THEIR NUMBERS ARE IN ADDITION TO </p><p>THE RELEASE LAST WEEK OF ANOTHER FIVE PROMINENT HAMAS </p><p>AND ISLAMIC JIHAD LEADERS.  ACCORDING TO HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>GROUPS, AT LEAST 160, AND PROBABLY AS MANY AS 200, </p><p>SUSPECTED HAMAS ACTIVISTS REMAIN IMPRISONED.  ACCORDING </p><p>TO IMAD FALOUJI, THE ISLAMIST MINISTER OF </p><p>TELECOMMUNICATIONS, THE RELEASES WILL CONTINUE. </p><p> </p><p>A DEAL IS STRUCK? </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) ACCORDING TO FALOUJI, THE PA IS ALSO CONSIDERING </p><p>LIFTING THE HOUSE ARREST IMPOSED UPON HAMAS SPIRITUAL </p><p>LEADER SHEIKH AHMED YASIN IMPOSED AFTER THE GUSH KATIF </p><p>BOMBING LAST OCTOBER.  ENDING HIS STATE OF ARREST AS </p><p>WELL AS CONTINUED RELEASE OF PRISONERS WOULD BE THE </p><p>RESULT, ACCORDING TO FALOUJI, OF AN AGREEMENT REACHED </p><p>BETWEEN PA AND HAMAS FOCUSSED ON FOUR ISSUES: (1) HAMAS </p><p>WILLINGNESS TO END ATTACKS FROM OR ON PA TERRITORY, (2) </p><p>HAMAS "HELP" IN "PERSUADING" FUGITIVES, INCLUDING </p><p>NOTORIOUS TERRORIST MOHAMMED DEIF, TO TURN THEMSELVES </p><p>INTO THE PA UNDER A PROMISE OF "FAIR" TREATMENT </p><p>(COMMENT: WE DOUBT DEIF WILL BE IMPRESSED BY THIS </p><p>OFFER), (3) AN END TO ANTI-PA INCITEMENT, AND (4) A PA </p><p>PROMISE THAT HAMAS WOULD BE ALLOWED TO CONTINUE ITS </p><p>"POLITICAL" (VICE "MILITARY") WORK.  TALK OF A </p><p>"CEASEFIRE" HAS ALSO AROUSED CONSIDERABLE ATTENTION IN </p><p>ISRAEL, ESPECIALLY CLAIMS BY ISRAELI DEFENSE FORCES </p><p>CHIEF OF STAFF MOFAZ THAT SUCH A DEVELOPMENT WOULD BE </p><p>"POSITIVE AND RIGHT."  FALOUJI QUOTED PA CABINET </p><p>SECRETARY TAYYIB ABDUL RAHIM, WHO HANDLES RELATIONS WITH </p><p>HAMAS FOR ARAFAT, AS SAYING THAT HAMAS HAD AGREED TO </p><p>THESE CONDITIONS IN A MEETING HELD EARLIER THIS WEEK. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) BUT OTHERS ARE NOT SO SURE.  AN AMERICAN </p><p>REPORTER WHO RECENTLY INTERVIEWED HAMAS ACTIVIST ISMAEL </p><p>ABU SHANAB TOLD POLOFF THAT ABU SHANAB HAD DISCUSSED </p><p>WITH HIM HAMAS\' ABILITY TO "TERRORIZE" ISRAEL WITH A </p><p>HANDFUL OF ACTIVISTS.  ABU SHANAB, RELEASED FROM PRISON </p><p>SHORTLY AFTER HIS ARREST, EXPRESSED NO REMORSE ABOUT THE </p><p>CONSEQUENCES OF THE GUSH KATIF BOMBINGS ON HAMAS-PA </p><p>RELATIONS.  SIMILARLY, GAZA REUTERS BUREAU CHIEF NIDAL </p><p>AL-MOGHRABI TOLD POLOFF ON NOVEMBER 18 THAT HAMAS </p><p>ACTIVISTS HAD REPORTED NO PROGRESS FROM THE SAME MEETING </p><p>BETWEEN THEMSELVES AND TAYYIB ABDUL RAHIM THAT FALOUJI </p><p>CLAIMED PRODUCED AN AGREEMENT. AL-MOGHRABI NOTED THAT </p><p>HAMAS HAD REACHED SIMILAR AGREEMENTS WITH THE PA IN THE </p><p>PAST, ONLY TO BREACH THEM WHEN AN ATTACK SUITED THEIR </p><p>INTERESTS. </p><p> </p><p>WHOM DID THEY ARREST AND WHAT WAS THE IMPACT? </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) CONTROVERSY CONTINUES LIKEWISE ON THE QUESTION </p><p>OF WHOM THE PA MANAGED TO ARREST AND WHAT THE IMPACT OF </p><p>THE ARRESTS WAS ON HAMAS\' ABILITY TO OPERATE.  A SENIOR </p><p>SECURITY ANALYST FOR TITULAR PA SECURITY HEAD MG NASSIR </p><p>YUSUF ADMITTED TO POLOFF THAT THE ARRESTS, WHILE BROAD, </p><p>HAD NETTED NO ONE FROM THE MILITARY WING.  SIMILAR VIEWS </p><p>WERE OFFERED BY NASSIR YUSUF HIMSELF, BY FALOUJI, BY </p><p>FATAH CENTRAL COMMITTEE MEMBER HANI AL-HASSAN, AND BY </p><p>THE EDITOR OF THE ISLAMIST WEEKLY, "AL-RESALLAH," GHAZI </p><p>HAMAD.  AL-HASSAN REPORTED THAT THE DEATHS OF IMAD </p><p>AWADALLAH AND OTHERS FROM THE MILITARY WING HAD INDEED </p><p>DISRUPTED "POLITICAL" CONTROL OVER THE UNDERGROUND CELLS </p><p>FOR A FEW WEEKS, BUT HE BELIEVED THAT SUCH CONTROL HAD </p><p>NOW BEEN REESTABLISHED. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) ON THE QUESTION OF TIES BETWEEN HAMAS\' POLITICAL </p><p>AND MILITARY WINGS, OUR CONTACTS DIVIDED SHARPLY.  GHAZI </p><p>HAMAD, EDITOR OF THE ISLAMIST "AL-RESELLAH," SAID THAT </p><p>RELATIONS WERE "IN CRISIS" AS A RESULT OF RECENT ARRESTS </p><p>AND THE APPARENT LOSS OF INFLUENCE BY THE MORE </p><p>"PRAGMATIC," INSIDE LEADERSHIP.  HAMAD ARGUED THAT THE </p><p>ARRESTS, WHILE RANDOM (ALTHOUGH WANTED, HAMAD AVOIDED </p><p>ARREST SIMPLY BY STAYING AT A FRIEND\'S HOUSE AND </p><p>AVOIDING HIS OFFICE FOR A FEW DAYS), WAS COMPELLING </p><p>HAMAS TO SHOW THAT IT COULD STILL RESPOND.  HAMAD ARGUED </p><p>THAT THE GUSH KATIF ATTACK WAS AN EXAMPLE OF THE LOSS OF </p><p>POLITICAL CONTROL OVER THE MILITARY WING -- YASIN HAD </p><p>BEEN DEEPLY TROUBLED BY THE ATTACK AND ITS IMPLICATIONS </p><p>FOR HIS FUTURE ABILITY TO COME TO A MORE VIABLE MODUS </p><p>VIVENDI (FROM HAMAS\' STANDPOINT) WITH THE PA. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) FALOUJI CAST THE PROBLEM IN DIFFERENT TERMS.  HE </p><p>TOLD US THAT YASIN\'S OBJECTIONS TO THE GUSH KATIF ATTACK </p><p>WERE NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF THEIR ABILITY TO WRECK HAVOC </p><p>WITH HIS ATTEMPTS TO IMRPOVE TIES WITH THE PA, BUT </p><p>BECAUSE THEY SHOWED THAT THE OUTSIDE LEADERSHIP WAS IN </p><p>A POSITION TO ORDER ATTACKS WITHOUT HIS SPECIFIC </p><p>APPROVAL.  BUT WHILE THERE WERE DISAGREEMENTS, FALOUJI </p><p>SAID THERE WAS NO QUESTION OF A BREAKDOWN IN </p><p>COMMUNICATIONS WITHIN HAMAS OR A CRISIS (AS HAMAD </p><p>CLAIMED) IN THE HAMAS LEADERSHIP. </p><p> </p><p>ENDING YASIN\'S HOUSE ARREST </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) AL-HASSAN ALSO REPORTED THAT HE HAD MET YASIN </p><p>RECENTLY AND HAD FOUND HIM TO BE IN "HIGH MORALE" AND </p><p>OCCUPYING HIMSELF BY READING ISLAMIC HISTORY.  THE </p><p>WHEELCHAIR-BOUND YASIN POSSESSES ONLY A "BRAIN, </p><p>IDEOLOGY, AND WILL," ACCORDING TO AL-HASSAN, AND HAS </p><p>LITTLE ELSE TO LIVE FOR OTHER THAN HIS "CAUSE."  BUT AL- </p><p>HASSAN WARNED THAT THE PROLONGED HOUSE ARREST OF AL- </p><p>HASSAN WAS PROVING TO BE COUNTER-PRODUCTIVE.  WITHOUT </p><p>YASIN AND WITH MOST OF THE LOCAL LEADERSHIP IN AND OUT </p><p>OF PA PRISONS OR OTHERWISE "MARGINALIZED," ACCORDING TO </p><p>AL-HASSAN, HAMAS\' OUTSIDE LEADERSHIP WAS BECOMING MORE </p><p>PROMINENT.  AL-HASSAN REPORTED THAT YASIN TOLD HIM </p><p>DURING THEIR MEETING THAT HE WAS "NOT RESPONSIBLE" FOR </p><p>ANY FUTURE HAMAS ATTACKS, IMPLYING THAT HE COULD NOT BE </p><p>HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR ATTACKS ORDERED FROM THE OUTSIDE. </p><p>AL-HASSAN SAID HE WAS URGING ARAFAT TO END YASIN\'S </p><p>ISOLATION, IF ONLY TO REASSERT THE POWER OF THE LOCAL </p><p>LEADERSHIP.  FALOUJI ALSO SAID THAT HE WAS PUSHING </p><p>ARAFAT TO RELEASE YASIN FROM HIS HOUSE ARREST AND HOPED </p><p>FOR RESULTS "VERY SHORTLY." </p><p> </p><p>DEALING WITH HAMAS </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) AL-HASSAN OFFERED A SIMILAR ASSESSMENT OF THE </p><p>WYE AGREEMENT TO THAT FOUND IN A HAMAS MEMORANDUM ON THE </p><p>SAME SUBJECT.  THE WYE PLANTATION MEMORANDUM WAS </p><p>BASICALLY A "SECURITY MEMORANDUM" RATHER THAN A </p><p>POLITICAL DEAL.  (COMMENT:  THIS VIEW IS WIDESPREAD IN </p><p>GAZA.)  HE EMPHASIZED THAT HAMAS WAS A POLITICAL PROBLEM </p><p>AND COULD NOT BE SOLVED BY PURELY SECURITY-RELATED </p><p>MEANS.  A PROBLEM, HE NOTED, THAT IRONICALLY PLAGUED </p><p>HAMAS ITSELF WHICH ALSO SOUGHT TO IMPOSE A "MILITARY" </p><p>SOLUTION ON THE POLITICAL PROBLEM OF THE ARAB-ISRAELI </p><p>DISPUTE.  AL-HASSAN DESCRIBED YASIN AS TAKING A LONG- </p><p>TERM VIEW OF HIS SITUATION.  "THESE MEN THINK IN TERMS </p><p>OF 25 YEARS, NOT A FEW WEEKS.  THEY HAVE NO EXPECTATIONS </p><p>FOR TOMORROW," AL-HASSAN COMMENTED.  AT THE SAME TIME, </p><p>HE NOTED THAT PA OFFERS OF A TRUCE TO HAMAS WOULD LIKELY </p><p>BE REJECTED.  THE PA HAD CONVINCED HAMAS NOT TO TAKE </p><p>"MILITARY" ACTIONS IN THE PAST, BUT HAD SUFFERED </p><p>GRIEVOUS LOSSES, INCLUDING MUHI AL-DIN AL-SHERIFI, THE </p><p>AWADALLAH BROTHERS, AND OTHERS.  AL-HASSAN CONCLUDED </p><p>THAT THE PA HAD MISSED OPPORTUNITIES IN THE PAST TO </p><p>DESTROY HAMAS (HE DID NOT SPECIFY WHAT THESE </p><p>OPPORTUNITIES WERE).  THE SOLUTION NOW WAS TO ISOLATE </p><p>HAMAS POLICALLY BY MAKING PROGRESS IN THE PEACE PROCESS. </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) FALOUJI ALSO SAID HE WOULD PUSH ARAFAT TO END </p><p>YASIN\'S HOUSE ARREST.  BASING HIS COMMENTS ON THE </p><p>ASSUMPTION THAT HAMAS HAS IN FACT OFFERED A "CEASEFIRE" </p><p>(AN ASSUMPTION OTHERS HAVE CHALLENGED, SEE PARA 5), </p><p>FALOUJI CLAIMS THAT THE PA MUST NOW SHOW ITS WILLINGNESS </p><p>TO MEET HAMAS HALF-WAY BY RELEASING MORE PRISONERS AND </p><p>ENDING YASIN\'S HOUSE-ARREST.  TO DO OTHERWISE, FALOUJI </p><p>CLAIMED, WOULD BE TO OPEN THE DOOR FURTHER TO HAMAS\' </p><p>OUTSIDE LEADERSHIP, WHICH, AS ARGUED AL-HASSAN, WAS </p><p>GAINING GROUND AT YASIN\'S EXPENSE THROUGH ITS CONTROL OF </p><p>HAMAS FINANCES.  FALOUJI WENT ON TO SAY THAT THE PA WAS </p><p>WEIGHING AN OFFER FOR HAMAS PARTICIPATION IN SOME </p><p>CABINET DELIBERATIONS RESPONSIBLE FOR FORMULATING THE PA </p><p>POSITION AND PLANS FOR THE POSSIBLE DECLARATION OF A </p><p>PALESTINIAN STATE NEXT MAY.  IN AN ASIDE, FALOUJI </p><p>COMMENTED THAT HAMAS WOULD MOVE PART OF ITS JORDANIAN </p><p>LEADERSHIP TO SYRIA.  FALOUJI SAID THAT MUSA ABU MARZOUK </p><p>AND KHALID MESHAL WOULD REMAIN IN JORDAN, AS THEY CARRY </p><p>JORDANIAN CITIZENSHIP. MOHAMMED NAZZAR AND OTHERS WOULD </p><p>LEAD THE MOVE TO DAMASCUS.  (COMMENT:  WE HAVE SEEN </p><p>NUMEROUS REPORTS OF A HAMAS MOVE TO DAMASCUS BEFORE.  SO </p><p>FAR, NO MOVE.) </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT: </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) THROUGH THE GUSH KATIF ATTACK (WE EXCLUDE THE </p><p>LATER JERUSALEM BOMBING FOR WHICH ISLAMIC JIHAD CLAIMED </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY) AND SUBSEOUENT CRACKDOWN, A RENEWED </p><p>DEBATE OVER HAMAS AND THE FUTURE OF HAMAS - PA TIES IS </p><p>TAKING PLACE IN GAZA.  THIS DEBATE APPEARS TO REVOLVE </p><p>AROUND AT LEAST TWO OUESTIONS THAT ADMIT NO EASY ANSWER: </p><p>(1) WHO CALLS THE SHOTS IN HAMAS (THE INSIDERS VS. </p><p>OUTSIDERS ISSUE) AND (2) WHETHER THE RECENT WAVE OF </p><p>ARRESTS HAS DONE ANYTHING TO DISRUPT RELATIONS BETWEEN </p><p>THE MILITARY AND POLITICAL WINGS OF HAMAS.  AS IS </p><p>APPARENT FROM THE FOREGOING, GAZANS THEMSELVES, </p><p>INCLUDING ISLAMISTS, HAVE ARRIVED AT DIFFERENT ANSWERS </p><p>TO THESE OUESTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) FROM OUR CONVERSATIONS THERE DOES SEEM TO BE A </p><p>GROWING CONCERN THAT HAMAS\' OUTSIDE LEADERSHIP </p><p>INCREASINGLY DESIRES TO BLOCK PA - HAMAS RAPPROCHEMENT. </p><p>THIS IS PRESUMABLY BECAUSE AN UPTICK IN PA - HAMAS </p><p>RELATIONS WOULD REDUCE OUTSIDE CONTROL OVER HAMAS BY </p><p>GIVING THE LOCAL LEADERSHIP A COUNTER-WEIGHT TO THE </p><p>OUTSIDE.  THE DESIRE TO MAINTAIN BETTER TIES MIGHT ALSO </p><p>PROVE TO BE A RATIONALE FOR SUSPENDING US OF HAMAS\' MOST </p><p>POTENT WEAPON: THE ABILITY TO MOUNT TERRORIST </p><p>OPERATIONS.  SUCH ARGUMENTS ARE PARTIALLY CONVINCING, </p><p>BUT NOT TOTALLY SO GIVEN THAT VIRTUALLY ALL OF HAMAS\' </p><p>POLITICAL STRENGTH DERIVES FROM ITS POSITION INSIDE GAZA </p><p>AND THE WEST BANK AND THUS CANNOT BE TOTALLY IGNORED BY </p><p>ANY ASPECT OF ITS LEADERSHIP.  HAMAS\' ROLE IN THE </p><p>PALESTINIAN DIASPORA IS MUCH WEAKER THAN, FOR EXAMPLE, </p><p>FATAH\'S.  IT WOULD ALSO APPEAR THAT HAMAS WOULD LOSE A </p><p>GREAT DEAL OF ITS POPULAR SUPPORT IF IT WERE TO LAUNCH </p><p>AN ATTACK NOW, GIVEN THE LIKELIHOOD OF A RENEWED CLOSURE </p><p>IMPOSED BY THE GOI. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C) ON THE SECOND QUESTION CONCERNING THE EFFICIACY </p><p>OF THE RECENT ARRESTS, MOST OF OUR CONTACTS (WITH THE </p><p>EXCEPTION OF HAMAD), BELIEVED THAT THE EFFECT WAS </p><p>NEGLIBLE.  IF WE CAN BELIEVE AL-HASSAN\'S STORY OF </p><p>YASIN\'S HIGH MORALE WHILE READING ISLAMIC HISTORY OR ABU </p><p>SHANAB\'S REMARKS TO THE AMERICAN REPORTER ENDORSING THE </p><p>USE OF TERROR TO "CONTROL" ISRAEL, THERE SEEMS TO BE </p><p>LITTLE QUESTION OF AN ORGANIZATION IN A DEEP CRISIS. </p><p>SEEN FROM THIS PERSPECTIVE, THE PERENNIAL </p><p>OUTSIDER/INSIDER QUESTION BECOMES ONE OF EMPHASIS RATHER </p><p>THAN ONE WHICH DETERMINES HAMAS\' OVERALL DIRECTION. </p><p> </p><p>15.  (C) AS A FINAL POINT, FALOUJI\'S COMMENT THAT "HAMAS </p><p>WILL NOT DISAPPEAR" SEEMS TO US RELEVANT.  THE PA IS </p><p>INCURRING SUBSTANTIAL PUBLIC ANGER BECAUSE OF ITS </p><p>CRACKDOWN, LESS BECAUSE OF PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR HAMAS THAN </p><p>BECAUSE THE CRACKDOWN IS PERCEIVED TO BE BOWING TO </p><p>ISRAELI AND U.S. DICTATES.  AT THE SAME TIME, THE PA </p><p>PROBABLY REALIZES THAT THERE ARE LIMITS TO WHAT IT CAN </p><p>DO AGAINST HAMAS FROM A PURELY SECURITY POINT OF VIEW, </p><p>GIVEN HAMAS\' DEEP-ROOTEDNESS IN SOCIETY AND GIVEN THE </p><p>VIEW OF VIRTUALLY ALL GAZANS, INCLUDING FATAH STALWARTS, </p><p>WHICH ACCEPTS HAMAS\' RIGHT TO ENGAGE IN POLITICAL </p><p>ACTIVITY OUTSIDE OF TERRORISM.  YET IT IS PROBABLY ON </p><p>THE POLITICAL LEVEL WHERE THE PA STANDS THE BEST CHANCE </p><p>OF WINNING ITS STRUGGLE AGAINST HAMAS.  FIRST, THE PA </p><p>WILL CLEARLY BENEFIT FROM THE PRESENT UPSURGE IN THE </p><p>PEACE PROCESS, EVEN IF THIS PROCESS BRINGS LESS THAN </p><p>MOST PALESTINIANS BELIEVE THEY ARE ENTITLED TO. SECOND, </p><p>HAMAS HAS FAILED TO DEFINE A CREDIBLE ALTERNATIVE TO </p><p>ARAFAT\'S COURSE OF ACTION.  PA PRESSURE AGAINST HAMAS, </p><p>ESPECIALLY IN THE IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH OF THE GUSH KATIF </p><p>BOMBING, WAS ACCEPTED BY MOST GAZANS AND SERVED AS A </p><p>USEFUL REMINDER TO ALL PALESTINIANS THAT HAMAS\' </p><p>TERRORIST ACTIONS THREATEN THE INTERESTS OF ALL </p><p>PALESTINIANS.  BUT PA EFFORTS AGAINST HAMAS TO BE </p><p>CREDIBLE WITHIN PALESTINIAN SOCIETY, MUST CONTAIN A </p><p>POLITICAL COMPONENT, AS AL-HASSAN SUGGESTED, AS WELL. </p><p> </p><p>WALKER </p><p></p></div>
