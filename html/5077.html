<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L HARARE 000077 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR CNEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/13/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MDC MAYOR OF HARARE SPENDS TWO DAYS IN JAIL </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) 1/11/03 BELLAMY-HARRINGTON TELCON B) HARARE 42 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: political section chief Matt Harrington.  Reasons: 1.5 ( </p><p>B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) Action request -- see para 5. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Mayor of Harare Elias Mudzuri was released from </p><p>detention on January 13 after spending two nights in jail. </p><p>He was arrested on January 11 along with his deputy mayor and </p><p>several city councillors during a meeting with constituents </p><p>in the Harare high density suburb of Mabvuku.  Although no </p><p>formal charges were filed, a police spokesman told </p><p>journalists that Mudzuri had violated the draconian Public </p><p>Order and Security Act (POSA) by not seeking advance </p><p>permission to hold the meeting.  After Mudzuri\'s attorney -- </p><p>Beatrice Mtetwa -- was denied access to her client most of </p><p>January 12, she was able to obtain a High Court order late </p><p>that day instructing police to produce Mudzuri in court and </p><p>make clear the charges against him.   In the morning of </p><p>January 13, Mudzuri appeared before High Court Judge Benjamin </p><p>Paradza, who ordered Mudzuri\'s immediate release, saying he </p><p>appeared to have no case to answer.  A police request that </p><p>Mudzuri be kept under detention while investigations </p><p>continued apparently fell on deaf ears. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  As reported ref B, Mudzuri is one of five mayors </p><p>representing the opposition Movement for Democratic Change </p><p>(MDC).  After he began making noticeable improvements to </p><p>Harare\'s roads and other infrastructure shortly after his </p><p>election in March 2002 by an overwhelming majority, the </p><p>Government of Zimbabwe launched a smear campaign to discredit </p><p>him with unsubstantiated accusations of corruption and </p><p>incompetence.  In addition, the Government appointed a </p><p>special commission to "help" Mudzuri devise a revitalization </p><p>plan for Harare and -- in a move widely seen as an effort to </p><p>hinder the ability of MDC office-holders to govern -- </p><p>recently announced its intention to create governorships for </p><p>Harare and Bulawayo, both of which are controlled by the MDC. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Comment:  Arresting an elected official for meeting </p><p>with his constituents is absurd, but it constitutes only the </p><p>latest move in a comprehensive Government campaign to harass </p><p>and discredit one of the opposition\'s most visible </p><p>officeholders.  Mudzuri had held a series of recent meetings </p><p>with Harare taxpayers to discuss the range of challenges </p><p>facing the city, including water shortages, and the GOZ </p><p>appears to have grown nervous about allowing him a forum for </p><p>addressing large groups of disgruntled Zimbabweans or for </p><p>correcting GOZ-disseminated attacks on the Mayor in the state </p><p>media.  This latest move suggests that the GOZ is </p><p>increasingly willing to abandon even the pretence of respect </p><p>for genuine democratic norms. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) Action requested:  Per ref A, we believe that </p><p>Mudzuri\'s arrest warrants strong criticism from the </p><p>Department, perhaps in a statement expressing outrage at the </p><p>Government of Zimbabwe\'s jettisoning of even the appearance </p><p>of democratic governance. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
