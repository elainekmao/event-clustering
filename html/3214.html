<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 003518 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/27/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAL, IS, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: UPON REFLECTION...JORDANIAN ESTABLISHMENT </p><p>INCREASINGLY CRITICAL OF PRESIDENT\'S MIDEAST SPEECH </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. AMMAN 03461 B. AMMAN 03495 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMBASSADOR EDWARD W. GNEHM FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p>1. (C) Mainstream Jordanians, who were initially inclined to </p><p>stress what they considered positives in the President\'s July </p><p>24 speech, are voicing increased criticism after two days of </p><p>reflection and questioning.  The practical effect of calling </p><p>for Arafat\'s removal has been a particular point of </p><p>contention.   Jordanians have also taken exception to </p><p>America\'s "dictating the outcomes of democracy" and inviting </p><p>Arab States in need of reform themselves to help democratize </p><p>the Palestinians.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>ON SECOND THOUGHT...LOTS OF RESERVATIONS </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Jordanians in the days after the speech have zeroed in </p><p>on the call for Arafat\'s removal.  Many complain that the </p><p>U.S. now has virtually ensured Arafat\'s re-election.   One </p><p>East Bank Law professor, who welcomed some elements in the </p><p>U.S. position, opined that any Palestinian who is elected </p><p>before the end of the Israeli occupation will be thought of </p><p>as "agent leadership" and will be assumed to be working for </p><p>the Americans and Israelis.  East Banker and Speaker of the </p><p>Upper House Zeid Rifai cautioned that Americans should not </p><p>interpret the widespread Palestinian disaffection from </p><p>Arafat\'s rule as a willingness to remove him, least of all at </p><p>the urging of outsiders.  Rifai and other Establishment </p><p>figures told the Ambassador that Palestinian anger towards </p><p>the U.S. has not lessened as a result of the speech. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) At the same time, Rifai also praised the official </p><p>positive GOJ reaction, which left room for maneuvering.  The </p><p>GOJ continues to press the positive elements of the speech. </p><p>The Jordan Times--Jordan\'s English daily--ran a large </p><p>headline the day after welcoming the President\'s speech and </p><p>official editorials in the semi-official Al-Rai paper have </p><p>applauded the speech as being consistent with Jordan\'s </p><p>vision.  (See Refs for media reaction). </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) While many Palestinian Jordanians are still voicing </p><p>appreciation for the call for a Palestinian state and an end </p><p>to the occupation, most still criticized the "humiliating" </p><p>and "patronizing" tone of the speech.  Many frankly view the </p><p>speech as the fulfillment of Sharon\'s wishes (no doubt partly </p><p>because of the triumphant tone in some Israeli reactions </p><p>cited in the press).  Almost all Palestinians here favor </p><p>reform, but view it as a matter for Palestinians themselves. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>HELP FOR DEMOCRATIC REFORM FROM UNDEMOCRATIC STATES? </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Another message that is also under review here is the </p><p>call for Arab States to help reform the PA.  Some contacts </p><p>pointed out the irony of asking Saudi Arabia, which has never </p><p>held national elections, to assist the PA in doing so.  One </p><p>Palestinian contact, who supports Bush\'s call for reform, </p><p>accused the PA of being a carbon copy of the Arab States and </p><p>asked hypothetically how you could ask the PA to reform </p><p>without demanding the same of other regional states. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Most Jordanians still agree with the endgame as </p><p>described in the President\'s June 24 speech and welcome his </p><p>expression of it.  However, most are doubtful that the </p><p>Palestinians can or will move ahead without Arafat.  More </p><p>broadly, many believe that the U.S. has set the bar </p><p>impossibly high by asking the Palestinians to create a new </p><p>constitutional system under the guns of an "aggressive" </p><p>occupying power intent (in their view) on extending the </p><p>occupation indefinitely. </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
