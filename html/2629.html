<p>UNCLAS KATHMANDU 000555 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, KWMN, PHUM, SMIG, NP, Human Rights </p><p>SUBJECT: PARLIAMENT PASSES WOMEN\'S RIGHTS BILL GRANTING </p><p>PROPERTY RIGHTS, ABORTION ACCESS </p><p> </p><p>REF: 01 KATHMANDU 2041 </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary.  Nepal\'s lower house of Parliament passed a </p><p>bill March 14 granting women more equitable property </p><p>rights, legalizing abortion under certain conditions and </p><p>dictating stricter penalties for child marriage, polygamy </p><p>and rape.  Although the law failed to pass the upper house </p><p>in late 2001, its second passage in the lower house was </p><p>constitutionally sufficient for enactment.  Members of </p><p>Nepal\'s largest minority party felt the law did not go far </p><p>enough in granting women equal property rights - </p><p>especially because women will still be required to return </p><p>inherited property on their wedding day - but put aside </p><p>these objections in order to get the bill\'s other measures </p><p>on the books.  The minority party plans to introduce </p><p>further amendments during the next session of parliament, </p><p>but will likely have difficulty getting them past the </p><p>Nepali Congress Party majority.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Abortion Law Loosened, Inheritance Restrictions Lifted </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p>2. Nepal\'s lower house of Parliament on March 14 passed an </p><p>amendment to the Civil Code that grants women more </p><p>equitable property rights, legalizes abortion under </p><p>certain conditions, and provides harsher penalties for </p><p>child marriage, polygamy and rape.  The bill\'s most </p><p>controversial provision requires daughters to return </p><p>inherited parental property if they get married.  A </p><p>similar bill passed the lower house October 10, 2001 </p><p>(Reftel), but was defeated in the upper house.  Since the </p><p>bill has now been passed by the lower house twice, under </p><p>Nepal\'s constitution, upper house endorsement will not now </p><p>be required.  The bill will next go to the Royal Palace </p><p>and will take effect immediately upon receiving the King\'s </p><p>assent. </p><p> </p><p>Minority Party Accepts Less-Than-Perfect Bill </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. In voting for passage, minority party MPs put aside </p><p>reservations that measures in the bill related to female </p><p>property rights did not go far enough.  Opposition MP </p><p>Pradeep Kumar Gyawali (CPN-UML) from Gulmi district said </p><p>that his party opposed the provision requiring daughters </p><p>to return their inheritance after marriage, but voted for </p><p>passage anyway to reap the benefits of the bill\'s more </p><p>positive features.  A female member of the upper house </p><p>agreed, citing the importance of passing measures related </p><p>to abortion and the property rights of divorced women, </p><p>which Nepali law had not previously addressed.  In </p><p>general, the government was not in favor of giving equal </p><p>rights to women, she added.  The punishment in rape cases </p><p>has been doubled, several UML parliamentarians noted with </p><p>approval. </p><p> </p><p>4. UML leaders plan to propose an amendment in the next </p><p>session of parliament specifying that sons and daughters </p><p>share equally in parental property, and permitting </p><p>daughters to keep their inheritance after marriage. </p><p> </p><p>5. Ruling Nepali Congress Party (NCP) Chief Whip, Tek </p><p>Bahadur Chokhal, viewed the bill as a move in the right </p><p>direction.  Its "good points" included legalizing abortion </p><p>with the consent of the husband, on medical grounds, or in </p><p>the case of rape.  The new law will allow a woman to keep </p><p>a share of the family\'s property after a divorce, which </p><p>was also a positive step.  Predictably, Chokhal noted the </p><p>provision granting female children the right to inherit </p><p>parental property, but less enthusiastically. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6. The new law is unlikely to satisfy women\'s rights </p><p>activists who were lobbying for equal treatment under the </p><p>law.  Moreover, given that the NCP maintains a clear </p><p>majority in the more powerful lower house, near-term </p><p>prospects for further efforts to rectify the civil code\'s </p><p>gender bias remain dim. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
