<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 KUWAIT 000818 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR INR/R/M, NEA/ARP, NEA/PPD, PA, INR/NESA, IIP/G/NEA- </p><p>SA, INR/B </p><p>WHITE HOUSE FOR PRESS OFFICE </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH, PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p>SECDEF FOR OASD/PA </p><p>CINCCENT FOR CCPA </p><p>USDOC FOR 4520/ANESA/ONE/FITZGERALD-WILKS </p><p>USDOC FOR ITA AND PTO/OLIA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KU, KDMR </p><p>SUBJECT: KUWAIT MEDIA REACTION, MARCH 6: EXILE FOR SADDAM; </p><p>IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>1.   Summary: While Kuwaiti chief editors spend today </p><p>penning editorials of sputtering outrage following the Iraqi </p><p>vice-president\'s characterization of Kuwait at Wednesday\'s </p><p>OIC session as "a monkey and a valet" in the service of </p><p>America, op/eds from earlier in the week praise the proposal </p><p>of Shaikh Zayed of Oman calling on Saddam to accept </p><p>voluntary exile.  In reaction to the Turkish Parliament\'s </p><p>rejection of a US deployment, Kuwait\'s Defense Minister said </p><p>Kuwait is ready to receive the troops. </p><p> </p><p>On other issues, various members of Kuwait\'s chattering </p><p>classes hold forth.  In a column entitled "The American </p><p>Problem," one writer offers the canard that "FBI centers </p><p>have become closer to Arab intelligence centers where </p><p>torture and humiliation are exercised against anyone Muslim </p><p>or anything Arab," while another opines that the return of </p><p>the Iraqi monarchy is the best solution for that country. </p><p>End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  News Stories: Defense Minister Sheikh Jaber Al-Mubarak </p><p>reiterated Kuwait\'s readiness to receive the American troops </p><p>that were destined for deployment in Turkey. </p><p> </p><p>Four thousand Saudi troops arrived in Kuwait on March 4 to </p><p>bolster GCC common defense "Peninsula Shield" forces already </p><p>deployed in Kuwait. </p><p> </p><p>Newspapers report that Kuwait International Airport will not </p><p>be closed if war breaks out, and that flight paths have laid </p><p>out with the military for civil and for military flights. </p><p> </p><p>Dean of the College of Sharia and Islamic Studies at Kuwait </p><p>University, Dr. Mohammad Al-Tabtabei, stated in a seminar at </p><p>the Kuwait Journalists\' Society that the foreign military </p><p>presence in Kuwait is religiously legitimate and justified, </p><p>and again condemned attacks on American soldiers in Kuwait. </p><p> </p><p>3.  "The Solution Is In Zayed\'s Initiative" </p><p>Faisal Al-Qanai wrote in independent Al-Seyassah (3/4):  "If </p><p>Arabs were serious about solving the Iraqi crisis to avoid </p><p>the destruction of Iraq, they would have discussed Shaikh </p><p>Zayed\'s initiative. His courageous initiative was aimed at </p><p>protecting Iraqi people, but unfortunately the Arabs did not </p><p>accept it." </p><p> </p><p>4.  "The American Problem" </p><p>Ghassan Al-Otaibi wrote in independent Al-Qabas (3/3): "The </p><p>US faces a major problem in introducing democracy to Iraq in </p><p>the post-Saddam era. It is widely expected that the Shiites </p><p>will be the winners of any popular election, and this will </p><p>not be acceptable either to the US or to Iraq\'s neighbors. </p><p>[T]o avert this problem, the only solution is the return of </p><p>the monarchy, which is an appropriate choice, given the fact </p><p>that the Iraqi royal family is Sunni and acceptable Iraq\'s </p><p>neighbors." </p><p> </p><p>5.  "Will the Islamic Summit Save What the Arab Summit </p><p>Damaged?" </p><p>Islamist Adel Al-Qassar wrote in independent Al-Qabas (3/4): </p><p>"If the Arab Summit at Sharm El-Shaikh was incapable of </p><p>addressing [Shaikh Zayed of Oman\'s exile proposal for </p><p>Saddam], then I believe that there is undoubtedly room under </p><p>the expansive Islamic umbrella to accept the courageous </p><p>initiative. [T]he UAE has the right to revive its initiative </p><p>at the Islamic Summit in Qatar in order to receive support, </p><p>and to succeed in ousting Saddam." </p><p> </p><p>6.  "The Arab Mockery" </p><p>Ghassan Al-Otaibi wrote in independent Al-Qabas (3/5):  "The </p><p>UAE initiative at the Arab summit was a logical solution to </p><p>avert the destruction of this region, but to form an Arab </p><p>delegation to visit the US and Europe is illogical and a </p><p>waste of time. The American and the European positions are </p><p>well-known, and this delegation will not be capable of </p><p>deterring the war unless Saddam steps down. Therefore, the </p><p>UAE initiative is the sole solution for the Iraqi crisis." </p><p> </p><p>7.  "With Souls, With Blood, We Redeem You, Bush" </p><p>Salah Al-Fadhli wrote in independent Al-Rai Al-A\'am (3/5): </p><p>"Does the United States have the right to boast that it is a </p><p>nation founded on the values of freedom, justice and </p><p>protection of human rights? Does it have the credibility to </p><p>say that it is seeking to sow democracy in the world? . FBI </p><p>centers have become closer to Arab intelligence centers </p><p>where torture and humiliation are exercised against anyone </p><p>Muslim or anything Arab. If there are moral justifications </p><p>for the invasion of Iraq, as claimed by Bush the Son, then </p><p>where were these justifications at the end of the Gulf war.? </p><p>Despite all these moral violations by America, and because </p><p>the Arabs have become accustomed to applaud whoever takes </p><p>office, the Arab masses will not be embarrassed to chant </p><p>their eternal slogan-- after changing the name only-- "With </p><p>souls, with blood, we redeem you, Bush". </p><p> </p><p>8.  "The Call for Resignation and The Arab Summit" </p><p>Dr. Shafiq Al-Ghabra wrote in independent Al-Rai Al-Aam </p><p>(3/5): "The Arab leaders at the summit should have met to </p><p>discuss how to convince the Iraqi leader to resign in order </p><p>to avoid a destructive war in the region. The leaders should </p><p>have discussed the role of the Arabs after Saddam and to </p><p>open dialogue with the Iraqi opposition. But, unfortunately, </p><p>Arabs have chosen not to touch on these topics, and </p><p>preferred to wait until the flood occurs." </p><p> </p><p>9. "An American Diplomat Resigns in Protest Against the </p><p>Policies of the American Administration" </p><p>Abdullah Al-Nafisi wrote in independent Al-Watan (3/5): </p><p>"J.B. Kiesling is a diplomat who worked for the US State </p><p>Department for over twenty years. Anyone who reads his </p><p>letter of resignation addressed to Secretary Powell will </p><p>immediately realize the internal collapse of the policies </p><p>adopted by the current American administration. Without </p><p>exaggeration, such voices are now increasing in the US due </p><p>to polices adopted by the current administration, which is </p><p>described as extremist." </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
