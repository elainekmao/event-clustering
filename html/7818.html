<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 ISTANBUL 000635 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, EUR AND EB </p><p>TREASURY FOR U/S TAYLOR AND OASIA - MILLS </p><p>NSC FOR QUANRUD AND BRYZA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, ECON, TU, Istanbul </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY\'S BANKING SECTOR: ON FIRMER GROUND, BUT NOT </p><p>OUT OF THE WOODS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>This is a joint Ankara-Istanbul cable.  Sensitive but </p><p>Unclassified - not for internet distribution. </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU)  Summary: Industry and government contacts in </p><p>Istanbul and Ankara concur that Turkey\'s banking sector has </p><p>improved considerably since the 2001 crisis.  Government </p><p>moves to impose effective and independent oversight through </p><p>the creation of the Banking Regulatory and Supervision Agency </p><p>(BRSA) in September 2000 increased transparency and public </p><p>confidence.  The takeover and resolution of 19 insolvent </p><p>banks, and partial restructuring of public banks, have </p><p>eliminated unfair competition and eliminated the worst </p><p>performers.  Most concur, however, that serious problems </p><p>remain, and that the sector remains extremely fragile, with </p><p>bank exposure not just to individual balance sheet problems, </p><p>but also to systemic risk as a result of Turkey\'s tenuous </p><p>macroeconomic fundamentals.  Turkish banks operate more as </p><p>hedge funds than commercial lenders, with government </p><p>securities making up a higher percentage (an average of 40 </p><p>percent) of their assets than loans.  Having gotten into the </p><p>government securities game, however, the banks have no easy </p><p>exit, other than through a long-range strategy of increasing </p><p>their capital and growing out of the problem.  However, the </p><p>quick end to war in Iraq, and declining interest rates have </p><p>given the sector some breathing room, providing profits in </p><p>place of the heavy paper losses that March\'s high rates </p><p>caused.  In the medium term, the sector needs increased </p><p>capitalization, either through foreign direct investment or </p><p>public offerings.  Either solution involves diluting </p><p>ownership of family-owned businesses, however, which will </p><p>face traditional barriers.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Snapshot of the Sector: Turkey\'s banking sector is </p><p>small by world standards, with total assets at the end of </p><p>2001 of only USD 122 billion.  Forty percent of that total is </p><p>accounted for by three state banks: Ziraat, Halk and Vakif </p><p>Banks (the first two being Turkey\'s largest banks).  On the </p><p>private side of the sector there are the big four-- Akbank </p><p>(the market leader), Isbank, Garanti Bank and Yapi Kredi (the </p><p>last being managed by the BRSA with a view towards its sale </p><p>in the medium term).  There are also six significant </p><p>medium-sized banks (by Turkey\'s standards)-- Kocbank, </p><p>Denizbank, Finansbank and TEB are the leaders in this </p><p>category.  In addition to small traditional banks, there are </p><p>also a number of "Special Finance Houses" (in Turkish legal </p><p>parlance) which follow Islamic banking principles.  Though </p><p>they account for only 4 percent of total banking sector </p><p>assets, they are politically important to the AK party, as </p><p>several ministers (including Finance Minister Unakitan) and </p><p>senior officials rose through their ranks.  Foreign </p><p>participation in the sector is extremely limited.  While a </p><p>number of foreign commercial and investment banks have </p><p>correspondent offices in Turkey, only two commercial banks </p><p>have entered the market recently-- HSBC through the purchase </p><p>of the bankrupt Demir Bank and Unicredito (Italy) through a </p><p>50/50 partnership with Koc Bank.  Analysts note that overall </p><p>the market is thin and undercapitalized, as is evident in the </p><p>fact that the "big four\'s" total assets barely equal those of </p><p>the National Bank of Greece (at around USD 40 billion). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Improvements Since the Crisis: If challenges remain </p><p>in the sector, all agree that the specific problems that </p><p>contributed to the 2001 crisis have been partially addressed </p><p>by post-crisis reforms.  BRSA Vice President Ceyla </p><p>Pazarbasioglu, in an April 17 meeting, pointed specifically </p><p>to the system\'s enormous short foreign exchange position </p><p>(addressed through a debt swap, and subsequent bank attempts </p><p>to avoid overexposure to exchange risk); high levels of group </p><p>lending (being brought down over four years to an </p><p>internationally accepted level-- Finansbank Chairman Husnu </p><p>Ozyegin noted to us on April 29 that whereas his FIBA group </p><p>was once his bank\'s number one customer, it is now only </p><p>number 7); and the sector\'s high level of non-performing </p><p>loans (being addressed by debt restructuring, as through the </p><p>Istanbul approach, and other steps).  In addition, we would </p><p>mention two big improvements: BRSA\'s intervention and </p><p>resolution of 19 private banks, which took out the sector\'s </p><p>worst performers; and the GOT\'s recapitalization of Halk and </p><p>Ziraat Banks (at a cost of about USD 25 billion). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) But problems remain: Those we canvassed in recent </p><p>weeks agree, however, that the sector is not by any means out </p><p>of the woods.  Key remaining issues include the lack of free </p><p>capital and the sector\'s overall need for increased </p><p>capitalization, maturity mismatches between assets and </p><p>liabilities, overexposure to government securities and </p><p>resultant "systemic" risk, and lack of other profitable </p><p>assets.  Though a range of banks have recently trumpeted </p><p>advantageous loan programs for members of such business </p><p>associations as the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce, TEB General </p><p>Manager Akin Akbaygil notes that overall there is no </p><p>significant loan demand by local clients, given prevailing </p><p>high interest rates and transaction costs.  That lack of </p><p>demand has led banks to shift more of their resources into </p><p>the government bond market, an area that Akbaygil quipped is </p><p>a little like "hell," in that it is easy to get into and very </p><p>hard to escape.  Indeed most analysts believe that </p><p>notwithstanding the fact that ownership of bonds by </p><p>individuals is at its highest level ever, the banks are now </p><p>trapped in a "pyramid scheme" from which they cannot escape. </p><p>The banks are clearly aware of the treadmill on which they </p><p>find themselves: Koc Bank General Manager Kemal Kaya </p><p>confirmed rumors that the big four have been exploring the </p><p>possibility of a government debt restructuring with the </p><p>government in Ankara, perhaps to be accompanied by a change </p><p>in reserve requirements.  Kaya indicated that then Treasury </p><p>U/S Oztrak had not responded to the proposal when he received </p><p>it in late March. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Systemic Risk: Pressure from the banks for </p><p>restructuring has likely eased in recent weeks, as the </p><p>overall market mood has lightened with the end of the war. </p><p>While banks were worried about heavy losses at the end of the </p><p>first quarter, as a result of high interest rates, they are </p><p>now enjoying windfall profits, given those rates decline. </p><p>However the long-term problem of their overexposure to </p><p>government debt remains, as does the maturity mismatch that </p><p>accompanies it.  While most deposits held by banks are one or </p><p>at most three month terms, government bond maturities have </p><p>increasingly been extended, and now average just over 14 </p><p>months.  Given that most bank-held bonds have a floating rate </p><p>or are denominated in foreign currencies, the banks no longer </p><p>face a large foreign exchange risk (it has effectively been </p><p>shifted to the government, which has been managing it well), </p><p>but the overall credit risk remains, and in the view of some </p><p>outside analysts should be provisioned against (though </p><p>currently government bonds are treated as no risk for </p><p>accounting purposes).  Akbaygil also alerted us to another </p><p>looming risk that has attracted little attention to date: the </p><p>banks\' exposure to the liabilities of the Turkish insurance </p><p>industry, which it largely controls through wholly-owned </p><p>subsidiaries.  Like the banks themselves the sector is </p><p>undercapitalized. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Structural Problems: Beyond the difficult </p><p>macroeconomic environment in which they work, banks also face </p><p>a tough operating environment.  Akbank CEO Zafer Kurtal noted </p><p>that in addition to high interest rates, intermediation taxes </p><p>and fees can easily add another fifteen percent to the cost </p><p>of a loan, even before any bank margin is considered.  Banks\' </p><p>problems are compounded by the continued lack of inflation </p><p>accounting (though the government has promised to introduce </p><p>it for the sector this year), which results in situations </p><p>like that faced by industry leader Akbank in the first three </p><p>months of this year, when it paid an effective 80 percent tax </p><p>rate on its profits.  The larger banks (especially Is and </p><p>Garanti) hold large real estate portfolios and other fixed </p><p>assets which cannot be easily liquidated in the present </p><p>economic environment.  Isbank, given its extensive industrial </p><p>subsidiaries, has faced extensive group losses which have </p><p>dragged down its bottom line.  Bender Securities analyst </p><p>Murat Gulkan notes that as a result the banks\' position is a </p><p>bit deceiving, in that they are not as solvent as their </p><p>current liquidity would otherwise indicate. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) The Lethal Bank/Media Mix: At least three of </p><p>Turkey\'s biggest banks are owned by groups with large media </p><p>holdings (YPK, Disbank, and Garanti).  The media subsidiaries </p><p>often slant "news" stories to promote their holding and bank </p><p>interests.  Thus Dogan\'s (Dis\' parent) recent series on the </p><p>BRSA\'s failure to collect from bankrupt banks\' former owners </p><p>also coincided with Dis\' attempt to acquire assets from the </p><p>BRSA.  Even so, there is legitimate public concern with the </p><p>failure to date to collect from former bank owners.  The </p><p>BRSA\'s inability to agressively pursue these debtors has been </p><p>the one black mark on an otherwise strong record. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) Comment: As TEB CEO Akbaygil noted to us, banking is </p><p>the superstructure of the overall economy, and consequently </p><p>will prosper or suffer in line with the economy\'s health and </p><p>the government\'s effectiveness in implementing the economic </p><p>reform program.  If reform implementation continues, analysts </p><p>see a strong upside-- a view that led one brokerage to </p><p>upgrade both Akbank and Isbank late last year.  Improvement </p><p>of the macroeconomic climate alone will not be enough, </p><p>however.  In the medium term, more capital is needed.  The </p><p>two most likely sources of this capital are direct foreign </p><p>investment or selling off more equity on the Istanbul Stock </p><p>Exchange.  Either choice will result in dilution of </p><p>family-owned bank businesses.  While some CEO\'s like </p><p>Finansbank\'s Husnu Ozyegin tell us they are prepared to </p><p>accept this (in the expectation that they will be able to </p><p>retain effective control even with a 25-30 percent share), </p><p>traditional attitudes on protecting the family "jewels" will </p><p>doubtless prove a barrier.
