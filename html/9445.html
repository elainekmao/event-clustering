<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L THE HAGUE 001816 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/16/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, KPAO, IZ, UK, NL, UNSC </p><p>SUBJECT: DUTCH SUPPORT LAUNCH OF IRAQ GOVERNING COUNCIL </p><p> </p><p>REF: SECSTATE 202537 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: PolCouns Mary Daly reasons 1.5 (b) and (d) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) On July 16, PolOff and British PolCouns delivered </p><p>reftel to MFA Adri van Loopik, head of the Gulf States </p><p>Division.  Van Loopik congratulated the US, UK and UN on </p><p>bringing together such a diverse and inclusive group to form </p><p>the Governing Council.  The Dutch are encouraged by the </p><p>actions taken to date by the CPA, and are impressed by the </p><p>individuals that have been chosen to represent the Iraqi </p><p>people on the GC.  Van Loopik further engaged PolOff and </p><p>British PolCouns in a discussion of the powers the GC will </p><p>hold.  When questioned if the GoNL would make a public </p><p>statement in support of the GC, van Loopik cited timing </p><p>difficulties because the FM is on leave.  However, he </p><p>suggested the possibility of an EU statement, which the Dutch </p><p>would fully support.  He commented that this issue may arise </p><p>at the EU FM\'s meeting (GAERC) on July 21. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Van Loopik also said that, with the departure of </p><p>Dutch troops to Iraq in August, the Dutch Parliament will </p><p>keep an even closer eye on the political and security </p><p>developments in country.  Any information demonstrating an </p><p>independent constitutional process would be welcomed by the </p><p>Dutch Parliament and public. </p><p>SOBEL </p><p></p></div>
