IN RESPONSE TO OUR DEMARCHE LAST FALL (REF A), THE </p><p>MINISTRY OF ECONOMY SHARED WITH US THE STATEMENT THAT IT </p><p>SUBMITTED TO THE NEGOTIATING GROUP ON MARKET ACCESS (NOVEMBER </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00350  141058Z </p><p>4-6, 2002), IN WHICH THE GOC ARGUED THAT CROATIA, ALONG WITH </p><p>OTHER COUNTRIES WHICH HAD NEWLY ACCEDED TO THE WTO, NEEDED </p><p>SOME "BREATHING ROOM" BEFORE IT COULD BE EXPECTED TO TAKE ON </p><p>ANY ADDITIONAL REDUCTIONS IN TARIFFS. </p><p> </p><p>2.  REF B FOLLOW-UP WAS FORWARDED TO OLGICA SPEVEC, ASSISTANT </p><p>MINISTER FOR TRADE AT THE MINISTRY OF ECONOMY ON JANUARY </p><p>27TH, BUT SHE WAS UNABLE TO MEET WITH US UNTIL FEBRUARY 11. </p><p>SPEVEC AND HER ASSISTANT FOR INTERNATIONAL TRADE, VESNA </p><p>FOCHT, REITERATED THE POSITION LAID OUT IN CROATIA\'S NOVEMBER </p><p>STATEMENT.  SPEVEC REPORTED THAT IN THE PREVIOUS WEEK\'S </p><p>MEETINGS IN GENEVA, CROATIA HAD SPOKEN ON BEHALF OF A GROUP </p><p>OF "NEWLY-ACCEDED" COUNTRIES, INCLUDING OTHER CENTRAL AND </p><p>EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES AND JORDAN.

SPEVEC ADDED THAT IN THE CASE OF CROATIA, IT WAS ALREADY </p><p>AMONG THE MOST OPEN COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD, IN TERMS OF ITS </p><p>COMPLETE BINDING OF TARIFF LEVELS.  ITS AVERAGE BOUND RATE </p><p>TARIFFS LEVEL FOR NON-AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS WAS 5 PERCENT, </p><p>WITH OVER 99 PERCENT OF ITS TARIFFS BOUND BELOW OR AT 14 </p><p>PERCENT.

SHE ALSO NOTED THAT MOST OF CROATIA\'S </p><p>NEIGHBORS, ASIDE FROM SLOVAKIA AND THE CZECH REPUBLIC, HAD </p><p>HIGHER TARIFFS.  WHILE SHE RECOGNIZED THE MANY BENEFITS THAT </p><p>LOWER TARIFFS HAD BROUGHT CROATIA (WHICH IS EXPERIENCING A </p><p>CREDIT AND CONSUMER-LED BOOMLET), THERE WAS ALSO A CONCERN </p><p>ABOUT BALLOONING TRADE DEFICITS. </p><p>ROSSIN </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00350  141058Z </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
