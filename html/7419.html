<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 002240 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARN, NEA/PA, NEA/AIA, INR/NESA, R/MR, </p><p>I/GNEA, B/BXN, B/BRN, NEA/PPD, NEA/IPA FOR ALTERMAN </p><p>USAID/ANE/MEA </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH </p><p>PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p> </p><p>TAGS: KMDR JO </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>                        Summary </p><p> </p><p>-- Lead stories in all papers today, April 14, </p><p>continue to focus on developments in Iraq.  Lead </p><p>stories also highlight the "serious" escalation of </p><p>U.S. threats against Syria, citing President Bush\'s </p><p>accusation of Syrian possession of chemical weapons. </p><p> </p><p>                 Editorial Commentary </p><p> </p><p>-- "After the fall of the illusion" </p><p> </p><p>Columnist Raja Talab writes on the op-ed page of semi- </p><p>official, influential Arabic daily Al-Rai (04/14): </p><p>"With the fall of the biggest statue of former Iraqi </p><p>President Saddam Hussein in the center of Baghdad, the </p><p>ideology, which is closer to illusion more than </p><p>anything and that prevailed in the Arab world and </p><p>among the Arab elite for years, collapsed.  It is an </p><p>ideology based on the belief that a dictator can </p><p>become the liberator and the symbol of freedom and the </p><p>maker of that freedom.  For many decades, Arab </p><p>totalitarian regimes succeeded in marketing themselves </p><p>as the refuge for the poor, as the road of salvation </p><p>for the Arab people from the repercussions of defeat, </p><p>and as the mouthpieces for the slogans to liberate </p><p>Palestine.  These regimes managed to fool the Arab </p><p>people for years and drag them from one defeat to </p><p>another..  Saddam Hussein has become a thing of the </p><p>past, but he did not go alone.  With him went the </p><p>illusionary ideology of the Arab world that baseless </p><p>political dreams can be achieved.  With him went the </p><p>ideology that dictators can make freedom and victory </p><p>and that they have the right, in the name of this </p><p>freedom, to kill millions." </p><p> </p><p>-- "The Iraq lesson from the Palestinian viewpoint" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Urayb Rintawi writes on the back page </p><p>of center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(04/14):  "The Iraq lesson bears so much significance </p><p>for the Palestinian issue.  From the Palestinian </p><p>viewpoint, the Palestinian reform program has acquired </p><p>added importance in the post-Saddam era.  The people </p><p>who resisted this program for one reason or another </p><p>must realize that the fate of the Palestinian issue is </p><p>now more closely linked to the achievement of this </p><p>program than at any other time.  They must be careful </p><p>not to give Israel the chance to draw a link between </p><p>the Palestinian authority and the Iraqi regime, </p><p>particularly when it succeeded in its `talibanization\' </p><p>of the Palestinian authority after the events of </p><p>September 11.  Also from a Palestinian viewpoint, it </p><p>is time to create a unified strategy that would be </p><p>binding for all the Palestinian national and Islamic </p><p>parties, that would regain the popular aspect of the </p><p>Palestinian Intifada and would limit military action </p><p>to operations against occupation soldiers and </p><p>settlement areas only.  The current stage is crucial, </p><p>and the experiment of a Palestinian prime minister </p><p>must succeed, for its success is the only way to stop </p><p>making the Palestinian the next in line in the series </p><p>of regime changes after Iraq." </p><p> </p><p>-- "In defense of the Iraqi people" </p><p> </p><p>Columnist Abu Yazan writes on the back page of center- </p><p>left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour (04/14): </p><p>"The feelings of contempt and anger that overtook the </p><p>Jordanian people over the past three weeks have </p><p>changed in the last days of the war, particularly </p><p>following the fall of Baghdad, into feelings of </p><p>resentment and denunciation that were not only </p><p>directed against the late Iraqi regime, but also </p><p>against the Iraqi people themselves..  We must be very </p><p>careful about shooting accusations and jumping to </p><p>conclusions.  The Iraqi people have nothing to do with </p><p>this war.  They are its primary victim.  They were not </p><p>consulted before it broke out, just as much as they </p><p>were not consulted in any of the major events of Iraqi </p><p>history.  The Iraqi people were denied freedom and </p><p>security for over thirty years.  They have a huge sum </p><p>of rejection for the dictatorship that made the people </p><p>suffer the worst.  It is therefore natural that some </p><p>of these people would act without discipline and even </p><p>without any civility." </p><p> </p><p>-- "Hurry up before it is too late" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Hilmi Al-Asmar writes on the back page </p><p>of center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(04/14):  "The usurpation of Iraq has lifted the cover </p><p>off the Arab political regimes.  All are now </p><p>candidates for the `liberation\' whether they like it </p><p>or not.  It is best for the political elites to start </p><p>changing their colors and taking cover with their </p><p>people by `liberating\' their people from oppression </p><p>and tyranny now when there is no pressure, before this </p><p>issue becomes a pretext for bringing down the </p><p>rejectionists and before their files are taken out of </p><p>the CIA drawers.  It is a new age, the age of </p><p>liberation and democratization by force.  So hurry up </p><p>before it is too late for you." </p><p> </p><p>-- "Help in several ways" </p><p> </p><p>Centrist, influential among the elite English daily </p><p>Jordan Times (04/14):  "The Bush administration must </p><p>indeed have a twisted notion of freedom if, as it said </p><p>yesterday, it really believes that `looting is a </p><p>natural expression of freedom\'.  Many have already </p><p>argued that the U.S.-British forces stood idle as </p><p>chaos swept Iraq\'s major cities as part of a </p><p>deliberate policy..  Today, we must think practically </p><p>of what Jordanians can do, in concrete terms, to </p><p>contain the damage..  There are plenty of good reasons </p><p>for recrimination: U.S. commanders did put guards at </p><p>Iraq\'s oil ministry, but not at hospitals, museums and </p><p>other crucial buildings.  It is unfortunately too late </p><p>to prevent many of those most precious, unique </p><p>artifacts from being smashed, disfigured, or stolen. </p><p>But it is likely that some of the looted items - </p><p>testimonies to the first great civilization ever - </p><p>might at some point pass through Jordanian soil.. </p><p>Relevant authorities, including the military and </p><p>police at all airports and crossing points, should </p><p>immediately be mobilized and enlisted in the effort to </p><p>restore to the Iraqi people what belongs to them.. </p><p>One of the greatest services that Jordan could do for </p><p>Iraq would indeed be to contribute to return at least </p><p>part of the vestiges of its great history and </p><p>heritage." </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
