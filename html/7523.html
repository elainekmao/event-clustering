<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 OTTAWA 001114 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EB/CIP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECPS, ECON, ETRD, CA, Trade </p><p>SUBJECT: CANADA: WI-FI SURVEY RESULTS </p><p> </p><p>REFTEL: STATE 85946 </p><p> </p><p>WE SOLICITED RESPONSES TO THE REFTEL SURVEY FROM INDUSTRY </p><p>CANADA\'S DIRECTOR FOR SPECTRUM AND RADIO POLICY FERNAND </p><p>LEGER.  THE RESPONSES ARE LETTERED ACCORDING TO THE </p><p>QUESTIONS LISTED IN REFTEL: </p><p> </p><p>A) Canada has designated several bands for license-exempt </p><p>operations including those currently of interest to Wi- </p><p>Fi802.11 bag standards and similar wireless </p><p>communication products (i.e. the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz.) </p><p> </p><p>The band 2400-2483.5 MHz is available for a wide variety </p><p>of license-exempt applications and products including Wi- </p><p>Fi (802.11b standard) and higher power point-to-point </p><p>communications systems using directional antennas.  The </p><p>Industry Canada (IC) rules for 2.4 GHz </p><p>(strategis.ic.gc.ca/SSG/sf01918e.html) and 5 GHz </p><p>(strategis.ic.gc.ca/SSG/sf01915e.html) spectrum </p><p>designations align with the FCC Part 15 Rules. </p><p> </p><p>In Canada the designations for wireless LANS are: </p><p>--band 5150-5250 MHz - lower (relatively) power devices </p><p>to operate indoors (200 mW eirp max) </p><p>--band 5250-5350 MHZ - medium power, outdoor operation is </p><p>allowed (250 mW tx pwr, 1W eirp/11 dBm/MHz) </p><p>--band 5725-5825 MHz - higher power, outdoor operation is </p><p>allowed (1 W tx pwr, 4W eirp/17 dBm/MHz) </p><p>--band 5725-5850 MHZ - devices are allowed to operate </p><p>point-to-point with directional antennas.  This band is </p><p>also designated for a range of lower power license-exempt </p><p>devices.  The technical rules for operation and </p><p>certification of equipment are detailed in the Canadian </p><p>Radio Standard Specifications (RSS) 210 </p><p>(strategis.ic.gc.ca/SSG/sf01320e.html) </p><p> </p><p>General information on the Government of Canada\'s (GOC) </p><p>spectrum policies can be found at: </p><p>//strategis.ic.gc.ca/sc_mrksv/spectrum/engdoc /spect1.html </p><p>?icservices=e._ </p><p> </p><p>B) License-exempt operation of equipment certified as Wi- </p><p>Fi (802.11) is permitted in bands designated in the 2.4 </p><p>GHz and 5 GHz ranges. </p><p> </p><p>C) Commercial applications of Wi-Fi systems are permitted </p><p>and encouraged.  License-exempt devices may constitute </p><p>transmission facilities to provide public </p><p>telecommunications services as defined in the Canadian </p><p>Telecommunications Act.  Operators of license-exempt </p><p>transmission links may need to seek approval for antennas </p><p>and tower structures, and follow Industry Canada\'s </p><p>procedures for use of radio spectrum. </p><p> </p><p>D) With the phenomenal uptake of Wi-Fi products to access </p><p>high-speed Internet by consumer and business users, a </p><p>number of traditional wireline and wireless carriers, new </p><p>service providers and ISPs offering high-speed Internet </p><p>have accelerated market trials for both Wi-Fi public </p><p>hotspots and use of Wi-Fi for providing high-speed </p><p>Internet access in urban areas.  Interest in providing </p><p>high-speed Internet service using Wi-Fi technology is </p><p>also emerging in rural areas and sub-urban areas, where </p><p>the potential of interference is relatively low. </p><p> </p><p>E and F) Private service providers are becoming </p><p>increasingly interested in using Wi-Fi products with more </p><p>directive antennas that provide longer reach to customers </p><p>in rural communities and surrounding areas.  A number of </p><p>rural communities have access to high speed Internet </p><p>using a range of technologies including license-exempt </p><p>products such as Wi-Fi access. Wi-Fi is used in schools, </p><p>libraries, and health centers and governments offices in </p><p>rural communities.  Information on Canadian wireless </p><p>ISP\'s can be found at: </p><p>www.onelasvegas.com/wireless/wireless_ISP_Can ada.html </p><p> </p><p>Fixed wireless access technology, of all kinds, is an </p><p>important element of the GOC objective to enable the </p><p>development of a range of broadband Internet access </p><p>technologies to provide for under-served rural </p><p>communities.  Industry Canada has a Broadband Pilot </p><p>Program (www.broadband.gc.ca/index_e.asp.) aimed at </p><p>encouraging the development of broadband services in a </p><p>number of rural and remote communities that are currently </p><p>not served by high-speed Internet.  Several rural </p><p>communities have been provided financing to carry out </p><p>business studies and seek requests for proposals to </p><p>establish the cost of transport systems (where required) </p><p>and local broadband access facilities using a mixture of </p><p>wirelinewireless technologies, including fibre optics, </p><p>digital microwave systems and satellite transmission.  In </p><p>the next phase of the program the communities will </p><p>present business and technical plans as part of their </p><p>applications to Industry Canada for financial assistance </p><p>to implement broadband service. Industry Canada </p><p>anticipates that some of these applications will use </p><p>wirelinewireless facilities. This will include licensed </p><p>and license-exempt local distribution facilities, </p><p>including Wi-Fi technology. </p><p> </p><p>CELLUCCI# </p><p></p></div>
