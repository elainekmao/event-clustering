CLASSIFIED BY AMBASADOR MARCELLE M. WAHBA FOR </p><p>REASONS 1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  SUMMARY AND COMMENT:  That OFAC continues </p><p>to hold more than than 120 million USD which </p><p>belongs to the UAE is a matter which we need to </p><p>resolve soon.  De facto Foreign Minister Hamdan bin </p><p>Zayid raised the matter in the context of last </p><p>Fall\'s bilateral Strategic Dialogue, and our </p><p>strongest partner here in the Global War on </p><p>Terrorist Financing, UAE Central Bank Governor </p><p>Sultan bin Nasser Al-Suweidi, has on several </p><p>occasions noted that our lack of response on this </p><p>key issue is incomprehensible to the UAE leadership </p><p>given their strong cooperation across the board in </p><p>the GWOT -- the Governor has explicitly stated that </p><p>our lack of action reduces his credibility and </p><p>capacity to advocate for even closer partnership </p><p>with us on terrorist financing issues.  The Arab </p><p>Bank for International Finance and Trade (ARBIFT) </p><p>has since the early 1990s been listed by OFAC as a </p><p>Specially-Designated National of Libya (SDN), </p><p>because of Libya\'s 42.5 percent equity stake in the </p><p>bank (the UAE owns 42.5 percent and Algeria 15 </p><p>percent).  The funds seized by OFAC, however, are </p><p>almost all payments to or from UAE entities -- no </p><p>Libyan money is involved at all. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  In an effort to remove the SDN status, the </p><p>UAEG has already replaced the Libyan General </p><p>Manager -- effectively eliminating any Libyan role </p><p>in the day to day running of the bank -- and </p><p>developed a UAE-focused business plan which leaves </p><p>no role for Libya.  Al-Suweidi says the UAE will </p><p>oust the last vestige of Libyan influence, the </p><p>Chairman of the Board, at the next Board meeting </p><p>this Spring.  The UAE will then be prepared to </p><p>dilute Libyan equity in the Bank, but notes that </p><p>nobody will buy shares as long as OFAC designation </p><p>tarnishes the reputation of the bank and prevents </p><p>any dollar-denominated business.  The Emiratis seek </p><p>an agreement whereby the SDN status is lifted in </p><p>return for their written commitment to </p><p>substantially lower, or eliminate, Libyan equity. </p><p>We believe the time has come to end this long- </p><p>running bilateral irritant -- it is no longer </p><p>consonant with our partnership with the UAE, </p><p>particularly on terrorist financing issues.  We </p><p>would ask that the Department engage actively with </p><p>the appropriate authorities to move this matter to </p><p>a satisfactory resolution.  END SUMMARY AND </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Central Bank Governor Sultan bin Nasser </p><p>Al-Suweidi told Econchief March 8 that the UAE </p><p>plans to replace the Libyan Chairman of the Board </p><p>of the Arab Bank for International Finance and </p><p>Trade (ARBIFT) at the next board meeting scheduled </p><p>for later this Spring.  Al-Suweidi said this </p><p>approach had already been approved and coordinated </p><p>with de facto Finance Minister Dr. Muhammad Khalfan </p><p>bin Khirbash, and reflected an ongoing effort by </p><p>the UAE to ensure that the Libyan role in managing </p><p>and overseeing ARBIFT is eliminated.  The UAE, the </p><p>Governor noted, had earlier removed the Libyan </p><p>responsible for day to day management of the bank </p><p>and replaced him with an Emirati. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  According to Al-Suweidi, discussions with </p><p>OFAC Director Richard Newcomb on the margins of </p><p>last November\'s bilateral Strategic Dialogue in </p><p>Washington had given the UAE hope that it might be </p><p>possible to reach a settlement of the long-running </p><p>ARBIFT issue.  (Note:  The bank has been listed by </p><p>the USG as a Specially-Designated National (SDN) of </p><p>Libya since the early 1990s owing to Libya\'s 42.5 </p><p>equity share -- the UAE also owns 42.5 percent and </p><p>Algeria the rest.  More than 120 million usd of the </p><p>bank\'s assets are currently frozen in the U.S.  End </p><p>Note.)  The UAE approach will be to remove any </p><p>Libyan involvement in running the bank (this has </p><p>already been done but for the largely symbolic move </p><p>of replacing the Libyan Board Chairman), and to </p><p>then present OFAC with an action plan or draft MOU </p><p>whereby the USG would drop the SDN listing in </p><p>return for an agreement by the UAEG to dilute </p><p>substantially or entirely Libya\'s stake in the </p><p>bank.  Al-Suweidi observed that the UAE recognizes </p><p>that it must take the next step on ARBIFT before </p><p>approaching OFAC again; that said, he hoped that </p><p>positive action by the UAEG would receive fair </p><p>consideration from the USG. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
