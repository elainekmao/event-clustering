(U) SUMMARY: SINGAPORE\'S FOREIGN MINISTER SHANMUGAM </p><p>JAYAKUMAR NOVEMBER 27-30 "SUCCESSFUL" VISIT TO HANOI </p><p>INCLUDED A DISCUSSION ON HOW BETTER TO COOPERATE AGAINST </p><p>INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM.  OTHER TOPICS INCLUDED FUTURE </p><p>ECONOMIC COOPERATION AND AID. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.   (SBU) TERRORISM:  JAYAKUMAR AND VIETNAMESE COMMUNIST </p><p>PARTY GENERAL SECRETARY NONG DUC MANH DISCUSSED WHAT THEIR </p><p>TWO NATIONS COULD DO BILATERALLY TO COMBAT INTERNATIONAL </p><p>TERRORISM.  ACCORDING TO SINGAPOREAN EMBASSY FIRST SECRETARY </p><p>DARRYL LAU KAI MUN, THE IDEA THAT SEEMED MOST APPEALING TO </p><p>BOTH COUNTRIES RELATED TO POSSIBLE INTELLIGENCE SHARING. </p><p>WHILE NO SUCH EXCHANGES CURRENTLY EXIST, HE NOTED, BOTH </p><p>SIDES EXPRESSED A DESIRE TO ESTABLISH SUCH A BILATERAL </p><p>MECHANISM, AND PERHAPS EVEN AN INTRA-ASEAN EXCHANGE, MORE </p><p>EFFECTIVELY TO COMBAT TERRORISM IN THEIR COUNTRIES AND IN </p><p>THE REGION.  A MEETING HAS BEEN TENTATIVELY PLANNED FOR </p><p>MARCH 2002 TO DISCUSS THIS ISSUE FURTHER, LAU ADDED. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) MANH:  LAU NOTED SINGAPORE\'S SATISFACTION THAT  GS </p><p>MANH HAD TAKEN THE TIME TO MEET WITH JAYAKUMAR, REFLECTING </p><p>THE IMPORTANCE VIETNAM PLACED ON ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH </p><p>SINGAPORE.  THIS WAS ESPECIALLY TRUE GIVEN MANH\'S </p><p>PARTICIPATION IN THE NOVEMBER 28 NATIONAL ASSEMBLY VOTE ON </p><p>THE US-VIETNAM BILATERAL TRADE AGREEMENT AND DEPARTURE ON </p><p>NOVEMBER 29 FOR CHINA IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING HIS MEETING WITH </p><p>JAYAKUMAR.

(U) ECONOMIC COOPERATION:  SINGAPORE NOW HAS MORE THAN </p><p>USD 6.8 BILLION INVESTED IN OVER 240 PROJECTS IN VIETNAM. </p><p>IN A SEPARATE MEETING, PRIME MINISTER PHAN VAN KHAI </p><p>ESPECIALLY PRAISED THE GOVERNMENT OF SINGAPORE FOR BUILDING </p><p>A TECHNOLOGY-TRAINING CENTER IN HANOI, AND THEN ELABORATED </p><p>THAT SUCH TRAINING WAS VITAL FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF </p><p>VIETNAM\'S FUTURE INFRASTRUCTURE AND DEVELOPMENT.  PM KHAI </p><p>REQUESTED THAT THE CENTER\'S SINGAPOREAN STAFF STAY ON LONGER </p><p>THAN THE ORIGINAL MOU REQUIRED; ACCORDING TO LAU, THE </p><p>VIETNAMESE DO NOT YET BELIEVE THAT THEY HAVE OBTAINED THE </p><p>REQUISITE LEVEL OF PROFICIENCY TO RUN THE CENTER ON THEIR </p><p>OWN.  LAU PREDICTED THAT THE GOS WOULD APPROVE THIS </p><p>EXTENSION IN KEEPING WITH ACCELERATING COOPERATION AMONG </p><p>ASEAN MEMBERS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  COMMENT:  WHILE THIS FOREIGN MINISTERIAL VISIT </p><p>FOLLOWED LARGELY PREDICTABLE LINES, THE DISCUSSIONS RELATED </p><p>TO COMBATING TERRORISM ARE SIGNIFICANT.  CONSIDERATION BY </p><p>ASEAN, OR AT LEAST SEVERAL ASEAN MEMBERS, OF INTELLIGENCE </p><p>SHARING IN THE GLOBAL WAR AGAINST TERRORISM SHOULD BE VIEWED </p><p>IN A POSITIVE LIGHT, AND FOLLOWS ON THE HEELS OF THE STRONG </p><p>STATEMENTS AGAINST TERRORISM AT THE ASEAN SUMMIT IN BRUNEI </p><p>AND THE RECENT MANILA MEETING OF ASEAN DEFENSE CHIEFS. </p><p>PLANNED MEETINGS IN EARLY 2002 OF THE ASEAN FOREIGN AND </p><p>DEFENSE MINISTERS ARE LIKELY FURTHER TO DISCUSS SUCH </p><p>EXPANDED ANTI-TERRORISM COOPERATION. </p><p>PORTER </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
