<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 DAMASCUS 002809 </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR NEA, SMEC </p><p>LONDON FOR TUELLER, PARIS FOR LEAF </p><p> </p><p>E.O.:  12958:  DECL: 05/19/07 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINR, SY </p><p>SUBJECT:  ASAD FAMILY UPDATE </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A) DAMASCUS 2466, B) DAMASCUS 2065, C) DAMASCUS 826 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR CHRISTOPHER W.S. ROSS, </p><p>REASON:  1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) SUMMARY:  THE LATEST STORIES ON THE DAMASCUS </p><p>RUMOR MILL SUGGEST A CLOSING OF THE RANKS WITHIN THE </p><p>ASAD FAMILY, WITH MIXED SPECULATION THAT THE STANDING </p><p>OF THE PRESIDENT\'S BROTHER RIF\'AT MAY BE IMPROVING, AND </p><p>A SEPARATE STORY THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS APPOINTED HIS </p><p>SON-IN-LAW, \'ASIF SHAWQAT, TO AN IMPORTANT NEW POSTING </p><p>IN THE SECURITY SERVICES.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>MIXED REVIEWS ON RIF\'AT\'S STANDING </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) ACCORDING TO SYRIAN CONTACTS IN THE BUSINESS </p><p>AND ACADEMIC COMMUNITIES, THE PRESIDENT\'S BROTHER </p><p>RIF\'AT IS BACK AT WORK AT HIS OFFICE AND SEEMS TO BE </p><p>CLOSE TO THE PRESIDENT\'S SONS, BASHAR AND MAHIR. </p><p>THESE CONTACTS INSIST THAT REPORTS THAT RIF\'AT HAS BEEN </p><p>OUT OF FAVOR WITH THE PRESIDENT ARE GROSSLY </p><p>EXAGGERATED, AND THAT RIF\'AT WAS NEVER FULLY OUT OF </p><p>GRACE SINCE HE WAS NOT STRIPPED OF HIS TITLE AS VICE </p><p>PRESIDENT.  IN THE EVENT THE PRESIDENT PASSES AWAY, </p><p>THESE CONTACTS MAINTAIN THAT RIF\'AT, BOTH AS VICE </p><p>PRESIDENT AND THE PRESIDENT\'S BROTHER, STANDS A GOOD </p><p>CHANCE OF RALLYING THE ALAWIS AND THEIR SUNNI ALLIES </p><p>AND ASSUMING THE PRESIDENCY. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) MEANWHILE A CONTACT IN THE SOCIALIST UNITY </p><p>PARTY (PROTECT) TOLD US THAT PRESIDENT ASAD AND RIF\'AT </p><p>MET MAY 10 IN QARDAHA FOR A RECONCILIATION MEETING </p><p>("MUSAALAMA").  OUR CONTACT SAID THAT THE </p><p>RECONCILIATION WAS FOR SHOW ONLY, AND BECAUSE PRESIDENT </p><p>ASAD WANTS RIF\'AT\'S SUPPORT TO CONVENE A NEW CONFERENCE </p><p>OF THE B\'ATH PARTY REGIONAL COMMAND (SEE REF B) AND </p><p>APPOINT HIS SON BASHAR TO THE COMMAND.  OUR CONTACT </p><p>CLAIMED THAT EVEN THOUGH RIF\'AT HAS BEEN COMPLETELY </p><p>MARGINALIZED IN THE GOVERNMENT SINCE RETURNING TO SYRIA </p><p>FROM EXILE, PRESIDENT ASAD RECOGNIZES THAT RIF\'AT IS </p><p>STRONGER THAN BASHAR.  ACCORDING TO THE SYRIAN </p><p>CONSTITUTION, ANY SUCCESSOR TO THE PRESIDENT MUST COME </p><p>FROM THE REGIONAL COMMAND. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) IN CONTRAST TO SOME OF THE VIEWS EXPRESSED </p><p>ABOVE, OUR SOCIALIST UNITY PARTY CONTACT SAID PRESIDENT </p><p>ASAD STILL DISTRUSTS RIF\'AT IMMENSELY, AND HAS </p><p>FORBIDDEN MAHIR AND BASHAR EVEN TO SPEAK WITH RIF\'AT </p><p>BEYOND SOCIAL NICETIES.  HE COMPLETELY DISCOUNTED </p><p>RUMORS THAT RIF\'AT IS CULTIVATING MAHIR OR MAINTAINS </p><p>GOOD TIES WITH MAHIR AND BASHAR.  HE ADDED THAT ONE OF </p><p>THE REASONS WHY RIF\'AT\'S SON SAWMAR LEFT SYRIA SUDDENLY </p><p>LAST YEAR (SEE REF C) IS THAT SAWMAR PULLED A GUN AND </p><p>POINTED IT AT MAHIR DURING A DISPUTE OVER MONEY.  ONCE </p><p>BASHAR HEARD OF THIS, HE HIT THE ROOF, SHUT DOWN </p><p>SAWMAR\'S RESTAURANT AND RAN HIM OUT OF THE COUNTRY. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) IN A RECENT CONVERSATION WITH US, AN ALAWI </p><p>FORMER DEPUTY PM AND IN-LAW OF RIF\'AT\'S (PROTECT) </p><p>DISMISSED RUMORS THAT RIF\'AT IS BACK AT WORK IN HIS </p><p>OFFICE.  ACCORDING TO THIS CONTACT, RIF\'AT\'S </p><p>OFFICE IS PRIVATE, AND THUS WAS NEVER SHUT DOWN BY THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT; AS OF NOW, RIFA\'T HAS NOT DECIDED TO RETURN </p><p>TO THIS OFFICE.  OUR CONTACT SAID HE COULD NOT IMAGINE </p><p>THAT RIF\'AT WILL EVER RESUME HIS DUTIES WHILE THE </p><p>PRESIDENT IS STILL ACTIVE.  ONLY IF THE PRESIDENT WERE </p><p>INCAPACITATED COULD HE IMAGINE RIF\'AT RESUMING ANY </p><p>GOVERNMENT RESPONSIBILITIES.  EVEN IN SUCH A SCENARIO, </p><p>HE ADDED, NO ONE WOULD COME FORWARD AND EXPRESS SUPPORT </p><p>FOR RIF\'AT UNLESS THE DECISION TO BRING HIM BACK INTO </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT CAME FROM THE TOP, I.E., THE PRESIDENT </p><p>HIMSELF. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) THE SAME CONTACT CITED IN PARA 6 DESCRIBED THE </p><p>RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PRESIDENT ASAD AND RIF\'AT AS </p><p>"NORMAL," BUT HE DID NOT SUGGEST ANY RECENT </p><p>RECONCILIATION OR IMPROVEMENT IN TIES BETWEEN THE TWO. </p><p>ON THE CONTRARY, HE MENTIONED THAT THE SARG IS </p><p>DISPLEASED WITH THE RECENT ACTIVITIES OF RIF\'AT\'S SONS, </p><p>MANY OF WHOM ARE NOW TRAVELING IN EUROPE AND ARE </p><p>RUMORED TO BE STARTING A MAGAZINE, SUSPECTED OF BEING </p><p>"PRO-DEMOCRACY" IN TILT AND U.S.-BACKED.  ADDING TO THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S CONSTERNATION, SAWMAR AL-ASAD RECENTLY </p><p>PUBLISHED AN ARTICLE IN THE EGYPTIAN NEWSPAPER "AL- </p><p>AHRAM" ABOUT DEMOCRACY.  WHILE THE ARTICLE DID NOT </p><p>MENTION SYRIA, OUR CONTCT SAID THE SARG CONFISCATED </p><p>THE "AL-AHRAM" ISSUES CARRYING SAWMAR\'S ARTICLE.  OUR </p><p>CONTACT ADDED THAT SAWMAR IS STILL OFFICIALLY BANNED </p><p>FROM RETURNING TO SYRIA. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>THE PRESIDENT\'S SON-IN-LAW MOVING UP </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) WHILE SPECULATION ABOUT RIF\'AT CONTINUES TO </p><p>VARY, A NUMBER OF EMBASSY CONTACTS HAVE REPORTED THAT </p><p>PRESIDENT ASAD RECENTLY APPOINTED HIS SON-IN-LAW, \'ASIF </p><p>SHAWQAT, TO AN IMPORTANT NEW POSITION IN THE SYRIAN </p><p>MILITARY SECURITY APPARATUS.  (COMMENT: SHAWQAT, A </p><p>BRIGADIER GENERAL IN SYRIAN MILITARY INTELLIGENCE </p><p>(SMI), IS MARRIED TO THE PRESIDENT\'S ONLY DAUGHTER </p><p>BUSHRA, WHO GAVE BIRTH LAST YEAR TO TRIPLETS.  BUSHRA\'S </p><p>LATE BROTHER BASIL REPORTEDLY WAS STRONGLY AGAINST HER </p><p>INVOLVEMENT WITH SHAWQAT, AN OLDER DIVORCEE WITH </p><p>CHILDREN.  IN 1993, BASIL REPORTEDLY HAD SHAWQAT PLACED </p><p>UNDER HOUSE ARREST AND SHAWQAT SUBSEQUENTLY WAS OUSTED </p><p>FROM A SENIOR POSITION IN SYRIAN MILITARY INTELLIGENCE </p><p>(SMI) AND FORCIBLY RETIRED FROM THE MILITARY.  SHORTLY </p><p>AFTER BASIL\'S DEATH, BUSHRA MARRIED SHAWQAT.  WHILE THE </p><p>PRESIDENT CONSENTED TO THE MATCH, IT IS BELIEVED THAT </p><p>HE WAS DISPLEASED WITH HIS DAUGHTER\'S DECISION. END </p><p>COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) LOCAL SPECULATION REMAINS SOMEWHAT VAGUE ON THE </p><p>EXACT SCOPE OF SHAWQAT\'S NEW JOB. ACCORDING TO SOME </p><p>CONTACTS, SHAWQAT IS IN CHARGE OF SUPERVISING ARMED </p><p>FORCES SECURITY AND COUNTER-INTELLIGENCE. ACCORDING TO </p><p>OUR SOCIALIST UNITY PARTY CONTACT, SHAWQAT HAS BEEN </p><p>APPOINTED DIRECTOR OF A NEW BRANCH OF THE </p><p>INTELLIGENCE/SECURITY SERVICES, "AL-AMN AL-QUWAT," </p><p>WHICH IS INDEPENDENT OF THE OTHER SECURITY SERVICES </p><p>BRANCHES (SMI, STATE SECURITY, POLITICAL SECURITY, </p><p>ETC...)  HE COULD NOT GIVE SPECIFICS ON THE MISSION OF </p><p>THIS NEW SECURITY SERVICE, BEYOND SAYING THAT IT CAN </p><p>INVESTIGATE ANYONE, "FROM CIVILIANS, TO MILITARY </p><p>OFFICERS, TO THE PRIME MINISTER."  OUR CONTACT </p><p>MAINTAINED THAT THIS IS AN IMPORTANT PROMOTION FOR </p><p>SHAWQAT, WHO HOLDS THE RANK OF BRIGADIER GENERAL </p><p>(AMID), BECAUSE ALL OF THE DIRECTORS OF OTHER SECURITY </p><p>SERVICES HAVE THE HIGHER RANK OF MAJOR GENERAL (LIWA), </p><p>OR IN THE CASE OF SMI CHIEF ALI DUBA, THE SUPERIOR RANK </p><p>LIEUTENANT GENERAL (IMAD). OUR CONTACT PREDICTED THAT </p><p>SHAWQAT WILL BE PROMOTED TO THE RANK OF MAJOR GENERAL </p><p>WHEN THE NEXT MILITARY PROMOTION LIST COMES OUT ON </p><p>JULY 1. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) LOCAL SPECULATION ON RIF\'AT\'S STANDING REMAINS </p><p>CONSTANTLY IN FLUX, WITH THE GENERAL CONSENSUS THAT, </p><p>DESPITE HIS MARGINAL STATUS WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT, </p><p>RIF\'AT REMAINS A KEY PLAYER IN THE SUCCESSION PICTURE, </p><p>PARTICULARLY AS A POTENTIAL LEADER OF THE ALAWI </p><p>COMMUNITY.  NEVERTHELESS, PRESIDENT ASAD, MORE THAN </p><p>ANYONE ELSE, SHOULD BE AWARE OF THE NEED TO KEEP A </p><p>TIGHT LID ON RIF\'AT, AND SEEMS UNLIKELY TO MAKE ANY </p><p>CONCILIATORY GESTURES TO RIF\'AT WHICH WOULD UNDERMINE </p><p>THE DELICATE POSITION OF HIS SON BASHAR. AT THE SAME </p><p>TIME HOWEVER, FURTHER ESTRANGING RIF\'AT FROM THE CLAN </p><p>OR TAKING PUNITIVE MEASURES AGAINST RIF\'AT\'S SONS ALSO </p><p>SEEMS UNLIKELY, AS THIS COULD ENCOURAGE DIVISIONS </p><p>WITHIN THE ALAWI COMMUNITY AND FUEL SPECULATION ON </p><p>REGIME INSTABILITY. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) THE REHABILITATION OF \'ASIF SHAWQAT, </p><p>MEANWHILE, SEEMS TO REFLECT A CLOSING OF THE RANKS </p><p>WITHIN THE ASAD FAMILY AND INNER CIRCLE. THE VERY </p><p>AMBIGUITY OF SHAWQAT\'S MISSION PUTS THE ENTIRE SYRIAN </p><p>SECURITY SERVICES ON NOTICE, IN THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS </p><p>OPENED UP A NEW CHANNEL OF INFORMATION AND ENTRUSTED A </p><p>ONCE-DISGRACED FAMILY MEMBER TO OVERSEE THE JOB. </p><p>PREVIOUS EMBASSY REPORTING ON SHAWQAT INDICATES THAT HE </p><p>IS AN ALAWI FROM THE TARTUS AREA, AROUND 50 YEARS OLD, </p><p>AND HAS FOUR CHILDREN FROM HIS PREVIOUS MARRIAGE.  IN </p><p>HIS PREVIOUS POSITION AT SMI, HE WAS REGARDED AS A </p><p>PROTEGE OF SMI CHIEF ALI DUBA AND REPORTEDLY LED A SMI </p><p>UNIT WHICH HAD RESPONSIBILITY FOR SUPPRESSING THE </p><p>MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD.  HIS APRIL 1993 RETIREMENT WAS </p><p>ALLEGEDLY LINKED TO CORRUPTION CHARGES AND INVOLVEMENT </p><p>IN SMUGGLING AND NARCOTICS, ALTHOUGH THIS WAS NOT </p><p>CONFIRMED.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>ROSS </p><p></p></div>
