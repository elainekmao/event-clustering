(C) SUMMARY: ON MARCH 20 THE IMF RESREP, GERRY </p><p>JOHNSON, AND THE IMF TEAM LEADER, PAULO NEUHAUS, GAVE </p><p>THE DONOR COMMUNITY AN HOUR-LONG OUTBRIEF ON THE </p><p>RESULS OF ITS 12 DAY VISIT TO ZIMBABWE.  NEUHAUS </p><p>PROVIDED NO NEW SURPRISES OR BOMBSHELLS, BUT DID </p><p>REVEAL, AS ANTICIPATED, THAT "THE CURRENT ECONOMIC </p><p>SITUATION IS VERY BAD AND WORRISOME, AND THE OUTLOOK </p><p>IS NEGATIVE."  COMMENTING THAT PROGRESS BY THE GOZ ON </p><p>ECONOMIC COMMITMENTS MADE AFTER THE SEPTEMBER 2000 </p><p>VISIT HAS BEEN FROZEN SINCE OCTOBER, NEUHAUS </p><p>DESCRIBED THE VISIT AS ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY TO CHART </p><p>OUT A RECOMMENDED PATH FORWARD.  THE FUND\'S MINIMUM </p><p>CRITERIA FOR RE-ENGAGEMENT (THE FIRST STEP OF WHICH </p><p>WOULD BE A STAFF MONITORED PROGRAM, OR SMP) ARE: </p><p>DEVALUATION AND A CREDIBLE FOREIGN EXCHANGE POLICY; </p><p>DRASTIC MONETARY POLICY TIGHTENING; THE RAISING OF </p><p>PARASTATAL TARIFFS (ELECTRICITY, FUEL ETC.) TO STEM </p><p>OPERATING LOSSES; AND STRICT ADHERENCE TO THE </p><p>SPENDING LIMITS CONTAINED IN THE 2001 BUDGET.  THIS </p><p>VISIT WAS A FOLLOW-UP TO THE ARTICLE IV BOARD REVIEW </p><p>OF ZIMBABWE IN DECEMBER 2000, FINANCE MINISTER </p><p>MAKONI\'S VISIT TO WASHINGTON LAST MONTH, AND THE </p><p>RECENT KOHLER/WOLFENSOHN/MUGABE MEETING IN DAR ES </p><p>SALAM.  LOOKING AHEAD, THE IMF WILL OBSERVE WHAT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01066  01 OF 02  210539Z </p><p>POSITIVE STEPS ZIMBABWE TAKES, AND WAIT FOR IT TO </p><p>SUBMIT AN ACTION PLAN, HOPEFULLY BEFORE THE SPRING </p><p>IMF/WB MEETINGS IN WASHINGTON. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) OTHER ECONOMIC DATA SHARED ARE THE FUND\'S </p><p>ESTIMATE THAT EVEN WITH THE FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF </p><p>BEST POLICIES AND PRACTICES IMMEDIATELY, REAL GDP </p><p>WILL SHRINK BY AT LEAST FIVE PERCENT THIS YEAR.  IF </p><p>ZIMBABWE STAYS WITH CURRENT POLICIES, THE FUND </p><p>BELIEVES THAT THE ECONOMY WILL CONTRACT SHARPLY, WITH </p><p>15 TO 20 PERCENT SHRINKAGE HIGHLY POSSIBLE.  "A </p><p>HUMANITARIAN DISASTER IS LOOMING," NEUHAUS TOLD THE </p><p>AUDIENCE, "AND WE SPEAK HONESTLY TO THEM ABOUT THE </p><p>DANGERS."  AFTER THE PUBLIC SESSION NEUHAUS CONFIDED </p><p>TO US THAT ZIMBABWE WAS IN ARREARS TO THE FUND ON ITS </p><p>PAYMENTS, WITH A LITTLE OVER U.S. 18 MILLION OVERDUE </p><p>BY ABOUT 20 DAYS.  NEUHAUS EXPECTS THE ARREARS TO </p><p>GROW, AS SPENDING FOR ENERGY TAKES PRECEDENCE OVER </p><p>LOAN REPAYMENTS.  "IF THE WILL IS THERE WE WILL WORK </p><p>TOGETHER," NEUHAUS SAID, "BUT ZIMBABWE\'S POLITICS </p><p>MUST DECIDE WHAT THE FUTURE WILL BRING."  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>FACING THE ABYSS </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) THE IMF TEAM LEADER, PAULO NEUHAUS, PRESENTED </p><p>A HARSH ASSESSMENT OF ZIMBABWE\'S FAILURE TO EXECUTE </p><p>EVEN BASIC PRINCIPLES OF GOOD ECONOMIC STEWARDSHIP. </p><p>HIS TICKLIST OF BAD BEHAVIOR INCLUDED VERY POOR AND </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  01066  01 OF 02  210539Z </p><p>EVEN DAMAGING MONETARY POLICIES (FOR EXAMPLE THE </p><p>RECENT ENGINEERED INTEREST SLIDE), THE CONTINUED </p><p>FREEZE OF THE PEGGED FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE, THE </p><p>FAILURE TO INCREASE FUEL PRICES, THE UNREVEALED COSTS </p><p>OF THE CONGO MILITARY PRESENCE, AND THE ONGOING LAND </p><p>RESETTLEMENT MOVES WHICH HAVE EXTINGUISHED INVESTOR </p><p>CONFIDENCE AND FROZEN OUT THE DONORS.   ANOTHER </p><p>EXAMPLE OF THE COUNTER-PRODUCTIVE STEPS THEY HAVE </p><p>TAKEN, HE EXPLAINED, IS THE RECENT PROGRAM TO LEND </p><p>STATUTORY RESERVES AT 15 PERCENT TO POTENTIAL </p><p>EXPORTERS, A FACT THAT ENCOURAGES THEM TO HIDE EXPORT </p><p>RECEIPTS EXTERNALLY, AT LEAST TILL DEVALUATION OCCURS </p><p>AND INFLATION SLOWS DOWN.  WHILE THE PEOPLE WE SPOKE </p><p>WITH ARE NOT IN DENIAL," SAID NEUHAUS, "WHAT THEY CAN </p><p>CONVINCE THEIR SUPERIORS TO DO IS VERY PROBLEMATIC </p><p>AND UNKNOWN."  THEIR ACTIONS OVER THE COMING MONTHS </p><p>WILL BE KEY IN DETERMINING IF THE RELATIONSHIP AWAKES </p><p>FROM "ITS PRESENT DORMANCY." </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>THE WAY AHEAD </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) NEUHAUS WAS CLEAR THAT RESUMPTION OF FUNDING </p><p>FOR ZIMBABWE IS A LONG WAY OFF.

THIS IS FAR FROM THE CASE </p><p>AT PRESENT, AT LEAST IN NEUHAUS\' VIEW.  HE CITES AS </p><p>AN EXAMPLE OF THE PATCHWORK QUILT OF ECONOMIC </p><p>POLICIES THE UNEXPECTED, DRASTIC FALL IN INTEREST </p><p>RATES THAT OCCURRED WHEN THE RESERVE BANK FLOODED THE </p><p>MARKET WITH LIQUIDITY IN EARLY FEBRUARY (REFTEL A). </p><p>WHILE IT HAS SAVED THE GOZ SOME INTEREST EXPENSE, DEEPLY </p><p>DEEPLY NEGATIVE INTEREST RATES HAVE CAUSED SAVINGS-HOLDERS </p><p>TO ATTEMPT TO DUMP THEIR ZIMBABWE DOLLARS ON THE </p><p>PARALLEL MARKET, INCREASING DEMAND FOR FOREIGN </p><p>CURRENCY AND DRIVING RATES UP.  NEUHAUS CONTINUED, </p><p>THAT ONLY IF A SOUND MACROECONOMIC PROGRAM IS LAID </p><p>OUT, COULD A STAFF MONITORED PROGRAM WITH QUARTERLY </p><p>TARGETS BE INITIATED.  IF THE RESULTS ARE GOOD (AFTER </p><p>A MINIMUM OF PROBABLY THREE QUARTERS OF MONITORING), </p><p>THEN A FUNDING ARRANGEMENT COULD BE BROUGHT TO THE </p><p>BOARD.  IF TARGETS AND CONDITIONS CONTINUE TO BE MET, </p><p>THEN CONSIDERATION COULD BE GIVEN TO TABLING ZIMBABWE </p><p>AT THE PARIS CLUB FOR RESCHEDULING TALKS.  GIVEN </p><p>POLITICS HERE, THIS IS A PATH STUDDED WITH HIGH </p><p>OBSTACLES. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) THE ATMOSPHERE DURING THE BRIEFING, WELL </p><p>ATTENDED BY ALL THE MAJOR DONORS, WAS ONE OF "HERE WE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01066  02 OF 02  210539Z </p><p>GO ONCE MORE."  NO ONE IN THE ROOM EXPRESSED ANY </p><p>OPTIMISM THAT THIS TIME THINGS WOULD GO DIFFERENTLY, </p><p>OR THAT ZIMBABWE\'S PATRIARCHAL LEADER WOULD WAKE UP </p><p>ONE MORNING SOON TO RECOGNIZE THE TWIN SHINING LIGHTS </p><p>OF ECONOMIC COMMON SENSE AND BETTERING THE LIVES OF </p><p>HIS NATION\'S CITIZENS.  IN ECONOMIC TERMS THE CHANGES </p><p>THAT HAVE OCCURRED SINCE THE IMF TEAM\'S VISIT HERE IN </p><p>SEPTEMBER HAVE ALL BEEN FOR THE WORSE, AND WE DO NOT </p><p>FORESEE A TURNAROUND UNTIL MUGABE IS AT LEAST RE- </p><p>ELECTED, AND MORE LIKELY NOT UNTIL HE NO LONGER SITS </p><p>IN THE PRESIDENTIAL CHAIR.
