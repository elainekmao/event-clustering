<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001729 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PD, AF/S, AF/RA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REPORT- EDITOR SUES INFORMATION MINISTER; </p><p>HARARE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Geoff Nyarota, Editor-in-Chief of the independent </p><p>      daily "The Daily News," has filed a Z$6 million lawsuit </p><p>      against Information and Publicity Minister Professor </p><p>      Jonathan Moyo for defamation.  Nyarota has also slapped the </p><p>      editor of the government-controlled daily "The Herald," </p><p>      Pikirayi Deketeke, with a similar lawsuit for publishing a </p><p>      defamatory article.  Nyarota argues that the article in </p><p>      question, which appeared in the June 7, 2002 edition of The </p><p>      Herald under headline "Moyo files lawsuit against Sikhala, </p><p>      Daily News," is insulting. </p><p> </p><p>  2.   The matter arose after The Daily News first published </p><p>      a story detailing court testimony in which opposition </p><p>      Member of Parliament Job Sikhala alleged that Minister Moyo </p><p>      had a homosexual relationship with former Zimbabwe </p><p>      Broadcasting Corporation Chief Executive Officer, Alum </p><p>      Mpofu.  Minister Moyo rebutted the controversial Daily News </p><p>      story in The Herald on June 7.  Moyo is quoted in the </p><p>      Herald story saying: "Nyarota is a disgraceful pervert </p><p>      whose indecency and vulgarity has gone too far, all in a </p><p>      morally corrupt crusade to win dubious international media </p><p>      awards."  In his papers filed with the High court, Nyarota </p><p>      said that the article suggested that he is an </p><p>      "unprincipled, unscrupulous, and unprofessional man who </p><p>      would do anything to win an award." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
