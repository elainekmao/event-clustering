<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 RANGOON 000576 </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p>BRUSSELS FOR USEU </p><p>USCINCPAC FOR FPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/02/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, TH, BM </p><p>SUBJECT: THAI/BURMESE RELATIONS - MAUNG AYE\'S VISIT AND </p><p>OTHER ISSUES </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) BANGKOK 2907 (B) BANGKOK 3147 (C) RANGOON 574 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: CDA PRISCILLA CLAPP. REASON: 1.5 (D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: THE THAI GOVERNMENT WAS PLEASED WITH BURMESE </p><p>ARMY COMMANDER MAUNG AYE\'S VISIT. ACCORDING TO THE THAI </p><p>EMBASSY\'S POLITICAL COUNSELOR, THE THAI GOVERNMENT NOW SEES </p><p>HIM AS A "PRAGMATIC" MAN OF RISING INFLUENCE IN BURMA WITH </p><p>WHOM THEY MAY BE ABLE TO WORK SUCCESSFULLY. WHILE IN </p><p>THAILAND, MAUNG AYE MET WITH THE KING, PRIME MINISTER THAKSIN </p><p>AND DEFENSE MINISTER CHAVALIT.  HE ALSO PROMISED TO IMPROVE </p><p>COUNTER-NARCOTICS COOPERATION, TO RESTRICT THE ACTIVITIES OF </p><p>THE UNITED WA STATE ARMY\'S HONG PANG COMPANY AND TO ESTABLISH </p><p>TWO NEW TOWNSHIP BORDER COMMITTEES.  IN ADDITION, HE PUT THE </p><p>FINAL TOUCHES ON A NEW FISHERIES JOINT VENTURE AGREEMENT </p><p>WHICH WILL REPORTEDLY BE SIGNED IN RANGOON THIS WEEK.  ON THE </p><p>OTHER HAND, MAUNG AYE DID NOT RESPOND TO THE MESSAGE CONVEYED </p><p>BY THAI FOREIGN MINISTER SURARKIART TO SECRETARY 1 KHIN NYUNT </p><p>IN EARLY APRIL REGARDING PROPOSALS FROM THE SHAN STATE ARMY </p><p>FOR TALKS, THOUGH THE CURRENT QUIET ON THE BORDER HAS </p><p>SUGGESTED TO SOME WITHIN THE THAI GOVERNMENT THAT TALKS MAY </p><p>HAVE ALREADY STARTED. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) MAUNG AYE AND KHIN NYUNT: THE THAI EMBASSY\'S POLITICAL </p><p>COUNSELOR, KALLAYANA VIPATTIPUMIPRATES, TOLD POLOFF MAY 2 </p><p>THAT THE RECENT VISIT BY BURMESE ARMY COMMANDER MAUNG AYE TO </p><p>THAILAND HAD GONE WELL. MAUNG AYE, HE SAID, WAS NOW A FIGURE </p><p>OF MAJOR INTEREST TO THE THAIS. MANY FELT THAT MAUNG AYE\'S </p><p>POSITION WITHIN THE GOB WAS ENHANCED AND KHIN NYUNT\'S </p><p>DIMINISHED BY EVENTS IN MARCH, INCLUDING THE ARREST OF THE </p><p>FAMILY OF KHIN NYUNT\'S MENTOR AND PATRON.  KHIN NYUNT, HE </p><p>SAID, STILL SEEMED TO BE FIRMLY IN CONTROL OF FOREIGN POLICY </p><p>AND THE MILITARY\'S INTELLIGENCE NETWORK.  HOWEVER, THERE WERE </p><p>SIGNS THAT HE NO LONGER HAD A FREE HAND IN DEALING WITH </p><p>BORDER ISSUES AND BURMA\'S MANY ETHNIC GROUPS.  SEVERAL GROUPS </p><p>CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH KHIN NYUNT, INCLUDING SOME CEASEFIRE </p><p>GROUPS AND SOME ETHNIC CHURCH GROUPS (THE KACHIN BAPTIST </p><p>CONVENTION), HAD RECENTLY COME UNDER PRESSURE, KALLAYANA SAID. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) MAUNG AYE, MEANWHILE, WAS A MYSTERY MAN FOR THE THAIS </p><p>-- THE SUBJECT OF MANY CONTRADICTORY REPORTS REGARDING HIS </p><p>FEELINGS TOWARDS THAILAND AND HIS PROFESSIONAL COMPETENCE. </p><p>AFTER MEETINGS BETWEEN MAUNG AYE AND THE KING, THE PRIME </p><p>MINISTER (ON FOUR SEPARATE OCCASIONS) AND DEFENSE MINISTER </p><p>CHAVALIT, HOWEVER, THE THAIS HAD COME AWAY WITH THE </p><p>IMPRESSION THAT MAUNG AYE WAS "A PRAGMATIC MAN" WHO WAS "NOT </p><p>NECESSARILY HOSTILE TO THAILAND." </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) ETHNIC GROUPS: KALLAYANA SAID THAT THE THAIS HAD </p><p>EXPECTED MAUNG AYE TO RESPOND TO THE MESSAGE REGARDING TALKS </p><p>WITH THE SHAN STATE ARMY WHICH THAI FOREIGN MINISTER </p><p>SURAKIART HAD RELAYED TO KHIN NYUNT IN EARLY APRIL (REFTEL </p><p>A).  THAT MESSAGE BASICALLY STATED THAT THE SHAN STATE ARMY </p><p>WAS READY FOR TALKS, BUT WOULD ONLY ACCEPT TERMS COMPARABLE </p><p>TO THOSE GIVEN THE WA, WHICH WOULD LEAVE THEM IN CONTROL OF </p><p>THEIR OWN CEASEFIRE AREA.  MAUNG AYE, HOWEVER,  SAID NOTHING </p><p>ABOUT THE MATTER AT ALL.  THIS LED THE THAIS TO CONCLUDE, </p><p>KALLAYANA SAID, THAT THE BURMESE HAD EITHER DISMISSED THE </p><p>SHAN STATE ARMY\'S PROPOSED TERMS AS COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE, </p><p>OR HAD ALREADY ESTABLISHED A BASIS FOR TALKS WITH THE SHAN </p><p>STATE ARMY WITHOUT THAI HELP.  IN ANY CASE, KALLAYANA NOTED, </p><p>THE NORTHERN BORDER THIS YEAR WAS FAR QUIETER THAN IT HAD </p><p>BEEN FOR SOME TIME. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) KALLAYANA ALSO SAID THAT THE THAI GOVERNMENT HAD BEEN </p><p>IN TOUCH WITH THE KAREN NATIONAL UNION\'S FORMER CHAIRMAN BO </p><p>MYA WHILE HE WAS HOSPITALIZED IN BANGKOK. THE KNU, HE SAID, </p><p>WAS GROWING WEAKER AND WEAKER, AND BO MYA BELIEVED THAT IT </p><p>WAS TIME TO STRIKE A DEAL WITH THE BURMESE. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) BORDER INCIDENTS: KALLAYANA SAID THAT THE MOST RECENT </p><p>BORDER INCIDENT, WHICH ERUPTED LAST WEEK WHEN UNITS FROM THE </p><p>THAI THIRD ARMY TOOK PRISONER THE SON OF THE COMMANDER OF THE </p><p>WA\'S 171ST BRIGADE, WOULD PROBABLY BE RESOLVED WITHIN DAYS. </p><p>THIRD ARMY COMMANDER UDOMCHAI, HE SAID, WAS JUST TRYING TO </p><p>TEACH THE WA A LESSON.  UDOMCHAI HAD BEEN PERSONALLY </p><p>EMBARASSED BY A WA ATTACK THAT HAD FORCED CANCELLATION OF A </p><p>VISIT BY THE THAI QUEEN TO HIS AREA, AND HAD BEEN LOOKING FOR </p><p>WAYS EVER SINCE TO PAY THE WA BACK. KALLAYANA SAID THAT HE </p><p>EXPECTED BORDER INCIDENTS LIKE THIS MOST RECENT ONE TO </p><p>CONTINUE, GIVEN UDOMCHAI\'S ANGER, BUT EMPHASIZED THAT THEY </p><p>DID NOT REFLECT THAI GOVERNMENT POLCIY AND WOULD NOT </p><p>INTERRUPT THE GENERAL IMPROVEMENT IN THAI/BURMESE RELATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) NARCOTICS COOPERATION: PM THAKSIN TOLD MAUNG AYE THAT </p><p>THERE NEEDED TO BE GREATER COOPERATION BETWEEN THE THAI </p><p>OFFICE OF THE NARCOTICS CONTROL BOARD AND THE BURMESE CENTRAL </p><p>COMMITTEE FOR DRUG ABUSE CONTROL IN SHARING INTELLIGENCE AND </p><p>CARRYING OUT JOINT OPERATIONS.  MAUNG AYE AND BURMESE HOME </p><p>MINISTER TIN HLAING, WHO SAT IN ON THE MEETING, AGREED. </p><p>THAKSIN ALSO COMPLAINED ABOUT THE ACTIVITIES OF THE HONG PANG </p><p>COMPANY, WHICH IS THE HOLDING COMPANY FOR MOST OF THE WA </p><p>COMMERCIAL INVESTMENTS, AND RECEIVED A COMMITMENT FROM MAUNG </p><p>AYE THAT THE HONG PANG COMPANY WOULD BE SHUT DOWN "WITHIN TWO </p><p>WEEKS."  MOREOVER, ACCORDING TO KALLAYANA, THAI INTELLIGENCE </p><p>REPORTS INDICATE THAT THE COMPANY\'S BRANCHES ON THE BORDER </p><p>ARE INDEED BEING SHUT DOWN. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS: KALLAYANA SAID THAT 2,860 ILLEGAL </p><p>BURMESE IMMIGRANTS HAD BEEN RETURNED TO BURMA AS OF APRIL 30. </p><p> ANOTHER 20,000 WERE IN HOLDING CAMPS IN THAILAND.  HE NOTED </p><p>THAT THE THAIS WERE PRESSING FOR QUICKER REPATRIATIONS AND </p><p>HAD ASKED THE BURMESE TO OPEN TWO ADDITIONAL RECEIVING </p><p>CENTERS AT KAWTHOUNG AND TACHILEIK, IN ADDITION TO MYAWADDY. </p><p>HE ALSO SAID THAT THE THAIS HAD AGREED TO SCREEN RETURNEES </p><p>FOR HIV/AIDS, BUT HAD MADE NO COMMITMENTS REGARDING SHARING </p><p>THE TREATMENT COSTS FOR THE MANY BURMESE WHO MAY HAVE </p><p>CONTRACTED AIDS IN THAILAND.  HE ALSO SAID THAT THAILAND HAD </p><p>RAISED WITH THE BURMESE THE POSSIBILITY OF INVOLVING THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION FOR MIGRATION (IOM) IN THE </p><p>REPATRIATION EXERCISE, BUT SAID THAT THE BURMESE HAD NOT YET </p><p>REPLIED TO THAT PROPOSAL. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) BORDER DEMARKATION AND CONTROL:  THERE HAD BEEN NO </p><p>FURTHER PROGRESS ON BORDER DEMARKATION, KALLAYANA SAID, BUT </p><p>PM THAKSIN HAD ASKED MAUNG AYE TO OPEN TWO NEW TOWNSHIP </p><p>BORDER COMMITTEES IN THE KANCHANBURI AND THREE PAGODAS PASS </p><p>AREAS.  HE ALSO PROPOSED THAT THE TOWNSHIP BORDER COMMITTEES </p><p>REMAIN PERMANENTLY IN SESSION TO HANDLE ANY DISPUTES THAT DID </p><p>EMERGE.  MAUNG AYE REPORTEDLY AGREED TO BOTH PROPOSALS. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) FISHERIES: THE FINAL DETAILS OF THE GIANT FISHERIES </p><p>JOINT VENTURE WHICH THE THAIS AND THE BURMESE HAVE BEEN </p><p>NEGOTIATING SINCE THAKSIN\'S JUNE 2001 VISIT WERE REPORTEDLY </p><p>WORKED OUT DURING MAUNG AYE\'S VISIT.  THE AGREEMENT WILL </p><p>REPORTEDLY BE SIGNED THIS WEEK IN RANGOON AND THE FIRST </p><p>OPERATIONS SHOULD START SHORTLY THEREAFTER. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) THREE POINTS ARE WORTH NOTING HERE.  FIRST, THE </p><p>THAI/BURMESE RECONCILIATION THAT BEGAN LAST SPRING IS STILL </p><p>MOVING FORWARD.  THE TWO COUNTRIES SEEM AS DETERMINED NOW AS </p><p>THEN TO ROOT OUT THE PROBLEMS -- FROM ILLEGAL MIGRATION TO </p><p>NARCOTICS TRAFFICKING AND SUPPORT FOR INSURGENT GROUPS -- </p><p>THAT HAVE PLAGUED THEIR RELATIONS FOR THE PAST SEVERAL </p><p>DECADES.  MUCH MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE, BUT THEY ARE STILL </p><p>WORKING ON THE ISSUES. </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) SECONDLY, THE THAIS ARE PROBABLY RIGHT TO PAY MORE </p><p>ATTENTION TO MAUNG AYE, THOUGH THEY MAY BE OVER-EMPHASIZING </p><p>THE DEGREE TO WHICH MAUNG AYE\'S STAR HAS RISEN IN RECENT </p><p>WEEKS. CERTAINLY MAUNG AYE APPEARS TO HAVE GAINED FROM THE </p><p>NOVEMBER RE-ORGANIZATION OF THE REGIONAL COMMANDS, WHICH </p><p>ALLOWED HIM TO PLACE OFFICERS HE TRUSTED IN MAJOR COMMAND </p><p>POSITIONS.  HOWEVER, HIS GREATER INFLUENCE ON BORDER ISSUES, </p><p>PARTICULARLY ISSUES AFFECTING THE ETHNIC AND CEASEFIRE </p><p>GROUPS, MAY SIMPLY REFLECT A GROWING FEELING WITHIN THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT THAT RELATIONS WITH THESE GROUPS ON THE BORDER ARE </p><p>A SECURITY MATTER FOR THE ARMY. AS SUCH, THEY MAY NOW BE </p><p>CONSIDERED MORE PART OF MAUNG AYE\'S PORTFOLIO, RATHER THAN </p><p>KHIN NYUNT\'S. </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) FINALLY, MAUNG AYE\'S COMMITMENT REGARDING THE </p><p>SHUTDOWN OF THE HONG PANG COMPANY WILL HAVE TO BE WATCHED </p><p>CLOSELY. THAT COMPANY NOW HOLDS MOST OF THE UNITED WA STATE </p><p>ARMY\'S COMMERCIAL INVESTMENTS, AND IS HEAVILY INVOLVED IN A </p><p>NUMBER OF LARGE CAPITAL PROJECTS.  IT IS HARD TO BELIEVE THAT </p><p>THE WA WOULD SIMPLY WRAP IT UP ON ORDERS FROM THE BURMESE. </p><p>MORE LIKELY, THEY WILL SIMPLY MOVE ITS OPERATIONS OFF THE </p><p>BORDER. IN FACT, LABOR MINISTER TIN WINN CONFIRMED TO THE </p><p>CHARGE\' ON MAY 6 (REFTEL C) THAT SOME HONG PANG BRANCH </p><p>OFFICES IN TACHILEIK AND AND OTHER BORDER TOWNS WERE BEING </p><p>CLOSED.  FURTHERMORE, EVEN IF THE COMPANY IS LQUIDATED, IT </p><p>COULD RE-EMERGE UNDER ANOTHER NAME.  THE WA NEED SOME VEHICLE </p><p>TO HOLD THEIR INVESTMENTS AND LIKELY WILL RESPOND TO ANY </p><p>PRESSURE FROM THE BURMESE WITH CHANGES THAT ARE AT BEST </p><p>COSMETIC. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>CLAPP </p><p></p></div>
