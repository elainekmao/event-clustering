MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:   DECL: 02/18/13 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, PHUM, CE, NO, JA, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  Playing hardball, Tigers continue to ramp up </p><p>the pressure in the north and the east </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  (A) Colombo 261; (B) 02 Colombo 1246 </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Lewis Amselem, Deputy Chief of </p><p>Mission.  Reasons 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY:  In the wake of recent incidents </p><p>involving the military, the Tigers continue to ramp up </p><p>the pressure in the north and the east by instigating </p><p>numerous rallies and general strikes.  The GSL and </p><p>monitors are working to calm the situation.  In a rare </p><p>event, recent LTTE activities have put it at odds with a </p><p>normally friendly Tamil party.  Through their latest </p><p>mafia-type activities, the Tigers are clearly sending a </p><p>message to the government that it should deal with the </p><p>group very, very cautiously.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>======================= </p><p>Ramping Up the Pressure </p><p>======================= </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) </p><p>continue to ramp up the pressure in the north and the </p><p>east.  Based on the LTTE\'s public announcements, the </p><p>latest activities form the group\'s hard-line response to </p><p>two recent incidents pitting LTTE cadre against the Sri </p><p>Lankan military.  (Note:  The first of these incidents </p><p>took place on February 7, and involved the interception </p><p>of a LTTE arms resupply boat by the Sri Lankan navy. </p><p>The second incident took place on February 12 when the </p><p>Sri Lanka Army stopped LTTE cadre in Jaffna and ordered </p><p>them not to wear military-type uniforms -- see Reftels. </p><p>End Note.)  In protesting these incidents, the LTTE has </p><p>sponsored the following major demonstrations and general </p><p>strikes in the past several days: </p><p> </p><p>-- On February 14, several thousand Tamils marched in </p><p>Jaffna town.  The march was basically peaceful, but </p><p>there were several small clashes with police and the </p><p>army.  The marchers presented a petition to the local </p><p>SLMM office complaining about the military. </p><p> </p><p>-- On February 17, the LTTE called a general strike in </p><p>Trincomalee District in the east.  Many shops were </p><p>forced to close.  In addition to the two incidents </p><p>reviewed above, demonstrators were also protesting the </p><p>arrest of two LTTE cadre allegedly involved in </p><p>recruitment in the Trincomalee area.  The two cadre were </p><p>granted bail later in the day. </p><p> </p><p>-- On February 17, several hundred pro-LTTE </p><p>demonstrators marched in Vavuniya, a town in the north- </p><p>central part of the country. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) In addition to these large events, the LTTE has </p><p>sponsored smaller anti-government rallies in other parts </p><p>of the north and east.  In the meantime, according to </p><p>contacts, the situation in Jaffna on February 18 is said </p><p>to be tense, with the army and the police strongly in </p><p>evidence.  The LTTE has also announced that it is </p><p>sponsoring a general strike in Jaffna District on </p><p>February 19.  Tamils are being asked to wear black </p><p>armbands and to fly black flags during the strike. </p><p> </p><p>(Note:  The latest tensions seem to have no direct </p><p>relation to an incident on February 16 in which a Sri </p><p>Lankan army soldier was killed by LTTE gunfire while </p><p>crossing into the group\'s territory on the Jaffna </p><p>Isthmus.  The incident appears isolated, with the </p><p>soldier apparently acting on his own.  The army is </p><p>investigating.) </p><p> </p><p>=================================== </p><p>GSL, Monitors try to Calm Situation </p><p>=================================== </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) In response to the LTTE\'s activities, the </p><p>government and the Norwegian-run Sri Lanka Monitoring </p><p>Mission (SLMM) are working hard to calm the situation. </p><p>As touched on in Ref B, the GSL has announced that it is </p><p>launching an investigation into the February 12 </p><p>incident, including reviewing the actions of the army </p><p>and the police.  As for the monitors, Hagrup Haukland, </p><p>the SLMM deputy, told us that the group was meeting with </p><p>government and LTTE officials "multiple times every day" </p><p>to ensure that both sides understood their </p><p>responsibilities under the terms of the February 2002 </p><p>ceasefire accord.  Haukland allowed that the situation </p><p>in the north and east was quite tense at this time, but </p><p>said he hoped that SLMM efforts would help lower </p><p>temperatures soon.  Haukland noted that the SLMM had </p><p>been able to broker an understanding between the </p><p>government and LTTE that Tiger cadre would not wear </p><p>military-style belts in government-controlled areas.  At </p><p>the same time, the GSL had agreed to contact the SLMM to </p><p>report alleged Tiger transgressions and not to try to </p><p>enforce the understanding on uniforms itself. </p><p> </p><p>============================== </p><p>LTTE Tensions with Tamil Party </p><p>============================== </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) In a rare event, recent Tiger activities have </p><p>put it at odds with a normally friendly Tamil party. </p><p>According to contacts, many members of the Tamil United </p><p>Liberation Front (TULF), a major constituent element of </p><p>the Tamil National Alliance (TNA), are furious with the </p><p>LTTE for its successful effort to postpone the reopening </p><p>of the Jaffna library planned for February 14 (see </p><p>Ref A).  Those who are said to be angry with the LTTE </p><p>include V. Anandasangaree, the leader of TULF and a </p><p>senior TNA MP.  Also at odds with the LTTE are the </p><p>former mayor of Jaffna and the former TULF members of </p><p>the Jaffna Municipal Council, all of whom resigned their </p><p>positions on February 13 in reaction to the </p><p>postponement.  (Note:  The resignations were largely </p><p>symbolic, as the five-year terms for the mayoral and </p><p>municipal council seats run out this week in any case.) </p><p>In press statements, Anandasangaree and the other TULF </p><p>officials have underlined that they wanted the library </p><p>reopened as soon as possible and did not appreciate the </p><p>LTTE\'s strong-arm efforts to cancel the February 14 </p><p>ceremony.  (Note:  It is not precisely clear why the </p><p>LTTE did not want the library to reopen, but -- in line </p><p>with its ongoing protests against the military -- the </p><p>group apparently did not want any outward signs of GSL- </p><p>Tamil amity at this time.) </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Commenting on the LTTE-TULF dustup, Kethesh </p><p>Loganathan, an analyst at a local think-tank, told us </p><p>that he was not sure how serious the split might turn </p><p>out to be.  He commented that Anandasangaree has always </p><p>been considered more independent of the LTTE than some </p><p>other Tamil political leaders (also see Ref B on this </p><p>point).  That said, he thought that Anandasangaree would </p><p>be careful not to antagonize the LTTE too much given the </p><p>group\'s reputation for retribution.  Loganathan went on </p><p>to remark that the LTTE had to be careful to ensure that </p><p>it did not alienate Tamil politicians, especially during </p><p>the ongoing peace process when it needed to show the </p><p>world a more moderate face.  (Note:  There are reports </p><p>that the LTTE has asked major Tamil party leaders to </p><p>visit the LTTE-controlled Wanni region later this month </p><p>for discussions focused on the peace process.) </p><p> </p><p>======= </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>======= </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) As reviewed in Reftels, the LTTE has been </p><p>steadily expanding its influence in the north and east, </p><p>often employing mafia-type tactics of intimidation and </p><p>extortion in the process.  Through their strong-arm </p><p>tactics in Jaffna and elsewhere of late, the Tigers are </p><p>clearly sending a message to the government that it </p><p>should deal with the group very, very cautiously.  It is </p><p>not clear how long and how hard the LTTE intends to </p><p>press the GSL and the military at this point, but most </p><p>observers believe the group does not want to undermine </p><p>the peace process.  At the same time, the Tigers will </p><p>have noticed that they have provoked a bit of a backlash </p><p>among Tamils, a development which may or may not cause </p><p>the group to back off somewhat.  As for the GSL, it is </p><p>being very careful not to allow the LTTE to provoke more </p><p>incidents.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) Minimize considered. </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
