<p>UNCLAS TEGUCIGALPA 001272 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR WHA/PDA (MBUCKLEY); WHA/CEN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: OIIP, PREL, KPAO, PGOV, IZ, HO </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON DRUG TRAFFICKING, JUNE 3, 2003 </p><p> </p><p>1. Editorial on liberal daily "La Tribuna", Tegucigalpa based </p><p>6/3   entitled:  "Plastic  Jails".  If  Honduras   does   not </p><p>demonstrate  a  serious interest on the  fight  against  drug </p><p>trafficking,  it  could become an issue which  may  harm  the </p><p>relationship  between Honduras and the  United  States.  This </p><p>happened to Guatemala, which has recently been accused  of  a </p><p>serious  lack  of  compliance  to  international  regulations </p><p>concerning this issue. </p><p> </p><p>Honduras  worked closely with the United States in the  fight </p><p>against drug trafficking. Now, there are more severe laws  to </p><p>penalize   narco  trafficking,  as  well  as  other  criminal </p><p>activities  related  to  drug  trafficking,  such  as   money </p><p>laundering. </p><p> </p><p>However, there is no point if the Honduran authorities arrest </p><p>and convict people responsible of such actions if the bars of </p><p>its  jails are made of plastic. This situation could be  much </p><p>worse  if  it is true that some authorities have collaborated </p><p>in  the  escape  of these criminals, as in the  case  of  two </p><p>convicted drug dealers who escaped when they were taken  back </p><p>to prison under police custody. </p><p> </p><p>Pierce </p><p></p></div>
