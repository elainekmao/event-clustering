IN A MARCH 21 MEETING, CONSIGLIERE GIORGIO MARINI, </p><p>MFA OFFICE DIRECTOR FOR SOUTHERN AFRICA, PROVIDED THE </p><p>FOLLOWING RESPONSE AND INSIGHTS: </p><p> </p><p>ITALY SUPPORTS THE EU POSITION, BUT ... </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.    (C) MARINI EXPLAINED THAT THE GOI FULLY SUPPORTED  THE </p><p>EU POSITION ON ZIMBABWE.  RECALLING THE FEB. 18 EU DECISION </p><p>TO IMPOSE SANCTIONS, MARINI SAID THE GOI VIEWED THESE </p><p>MEASURES AS A NECESSARY RESPONSE TO THE GOZ\'S REFUSAL TO GIVE </p><p>GROUND ON PRESS AND JUDICIAL FREEDOMS DURING A DIALOGUE WITH </p><p>THE EU BASED ON THE COTONOU AGREEMENT.  THE EU APPROACH WAS </p><p>CALIBRATED TO AVOID WEAKENING THE IMPACT OF INTERNATIONAL </p><p>OPPOSITION TO MUGABE\'S ACTIONS BY LEAVING AN OPENING TO THOSE </p><p>WHO WOULD PAINT IT AS NEO-IMPERIALISM.  HOWEVER, MARINI\'S </p><p>PERSONAL OPINION WAS THAT EU SANCTIONS WERE UNLIKELY TO BRING </p><p>ABOUT DEMOCRATIC CHANGE. </p><p> </p><p>THE IMPORTANCE OF PEER PRESSURE </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.    (C) WHAT COULD BE MORE EFFECTIVE WOULD BE CONDEMNATION </p><p>OF MUGABE\'S ACTIONS BY REGIONAL POWERS IN ADDITION TO THE </p><p>WEST.  MARINI SUGGESTED THAT ZIMBABWE\'S DEPENDENCE ON SOUTH </p><p>AFRICA FOR OIL AND GAS PROVIDED A KEY LEVER FOR PRESSURE. </p><p>SOUTH AFRICA\'S IMPORTANCE AS A MARKET FOR ZIMBABWE GAVE IT </p><p>FURTHER LEVERAGE. </p><p> </p><p>5.    (C) ASKED WHY HE THOUGHT MBEKI HAD EVENTUALLY SUPPORTED </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01511  01 OF 02  252356Z </p><p>THE COMMONWEALTH\'S EXPULSION OF ZIMBABWE, MARINI CITED UK AND </p><p>U.S. PRESSURE AND SOUTH AFRICA\'S KEY ROLE IN THE NEW ECONOMIC </p><p>PARTNERSHIP FOR AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT (NEPAD).  ONLY WHEN HIS </p><p>"BACK WAS TO THE WALL" WAS MBEKI WILLING TO OVERCOME DOMESTIC </p><p>PRESSURES AND OPPOSE MUGABE.  THE SITUATION WAS COMPLICATED </p><p>FOR THE GSA, BECAUSE, ON THE ONE HAND, MUGABE HAD STOOD WITH </p><p>THE ANC AGAINST APARTHEID IN SPITE OF HIS PERSONAL RIVALRY </p><p>WITH MANDELA FOR THE LEADERSHIP OF SOUTHERN AFRICAN </p><p>DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY (SADC).  ON THE OTHER HAND, SOUTH </p><p>AFRICA WANTED TO HEAD OFF A CIVIL WAR ON ITS BORDER CAUSED BY </p><p>POLITICAL OUTRAGE, IN ORDER TO AVOID AN INFLUX OF REFUGEES. </p><p>FURTHERMORE, MBEKI WANTED TO MAINTAIN AN UNTARNISHED </p><p>LEADERSHIP ROLE IN NEPAD, SINCE HE RECOGNIZED THAT THE KEY TO </p><p>AFRICA\'S FUTURE WAS WESTERN PARTNERSHIP AND INVESTMENT. </p><p> </p><p>6.    (C) PER REF A, MARINI CALLED FOR CLOSE U.S.-EU </p><p>COORDINATION THAT INCLUDED NIGERIA AND SOUTH AFRICA.  SUPPORT </p><p>OF AFRICAN AND LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES IN THE UNHCR COULD </p><p>ALSO PROVE IMPORTANT. </p><p> </p><p>7.    (C) MARINI PROVIDED A DRAFT COPY OF A REPLY FROM </p><p>BERLUSCONI TO SECRETARY POWELL THAT HAD NOT YET BEEN CLEARED </p><p>BY THE PM\'S OFFICE.  IT SAYS THAT BERLUSCONI SHARES U.S. </p><p>CONCERNS AND VIEWS ON THE LEGITIMACY OF THE ELECTION AND IS </p><p>PLEASED WITH THE RECENT COMMONWEALTH DECISION TO SUSPEND </p><p>ZIMBABWE.  AN EU TROIKA WILL CONSULT WITH SADC COUNTRIES TO </p><p>IMPRESS UPON THEM THE NECESSITY TO STAND UP FOR HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTO0475 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  01511  02 OF 02  252356Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  ACQ-00   CA-01    CEA-01 </p><p>      CIAE-00  CIP-00   COME-00  CTME-00  INL-00   USNW-00  DODE-00 </p><p>      DOEE-00  DOTE-00  WHA-00   SRPP-00  DS-00    EAP-00   EB-00 </p><p>      EUR-00   EXIM-01  E-00     FAAE-00  VC-00    FRB-00   H-01 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    ITC-01   LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00 </p><p>      AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00 </p><p>      PC-01    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    SSO-00 </p><p>      SS-00    STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  VO-03    R-00     EPAE-00 </p><p>      IIP-00   PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-02   G-00     SAS-00 </p><p>      SWCI-00    /017W </p><p>                  ------------------7A5F78  252356Z /69 </p><p>R 251550Z MAR 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 2929 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY ABUJA </p><p>AMEMBASSY GABORONE </p><p>AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>AMEMBASSY LONDON </p><p>AMEMBASSY LUANDA </p><p>AMEMBASSY LUSAKA </p><p>AMEMBASSY MAPUTO </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p>AMEMBASSY PARIS </p><p>AMEMBASSY PRETORIA </p><p>AMEMBASSY WINDHOEK </p><p>USEU BRUSSELS 2603 </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  01511  02 OF 02  252356Z </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 ROME 001511 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/22/2007 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PHUM, ETTC, SADC, OPDC, SA, ZI, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: ITALY ON ZIMBABWE:  PEER PRESSURE BEST HOPE FOR </p><p>DEMOCRACY </p><p> </p><p>AND DEMOCRACY. </p><p> </p><p>EU\'S NEXT STEPS DEPEND ON MUGABE </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.
