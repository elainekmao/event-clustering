<p>UNCLAS ISTANBUL 000280 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR P, E, EUR AND EB </p><p>TREASURY FOR U/S TAYLOR AND OASIA - MILLS </p><p>NSC FOR QUANRUD AND BRYZA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, PREL, TU, Istanbul </p><p>SUBJECT: MARKET PLAYERS FACE THE NEW REALITIES </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 1153 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but Unclassified - not for internet distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary:  Istanbul market analysts are grappling </p><p>with the new political landscape following Saturday\'s </p><p>parliamentary vote against permitting U.S. troops.  The </p><p>development was a shock: despite difficulties in </p><p>negotiations, the market had long assumed (and priced in) a </p><p>positive outcome.   While some observers still hold out hope </p><p>a second vote will be held after AK deputies take in the </p><p>market consequences of their action, others are less </p><p>sanguine.  All agree that what is required now is renewed </p><p>commitment to the IMF program.  Prime Minister Gul\'s </p><p>pre-market opening announcement of agreement on the 2003 </p><p>budget with the IMF is being taken as a sign that he </p><p>understands this reality.  Some doubt whether such a policy </p><p>is sustainable in the medium term, however, as a war\'s </p><p>contractionary impact hits home.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) A Jaw-dropping Surprise: Saturday\'s decision was a </p><p>shock to the market, which despite tough rhetoric had never </p><p>really doubted that at the end of the day Turkey would hew to </p><p>its strategic partnership with the U.S. and recognize the </p><p>important role a U.S. package could play in counterbalancing </p><p>an Iraq operation\'s economic impact.  As J.P. Morgan\'s Koray </p><p>Arikan commented Saturday night after the vote, "the markets </p><p>had priced in the deal, and viewed the parliamentary process </p><p>as cosmetics."  Indeed, at the range of brokerages we </p><p>canvassed last week there was little doubt that approval </p><p>would come, and more interest in the mechanics of how the </p><p>U.S. assistance (which all saw as critical to the </p><p>sustainability of Turkey\'s debt) would function. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) A Silver Lining: Coupled with concern about how </p><p>Turkey will cover its financing gap without assistance, </p><p>however, some analysts see a hint of a silver lining.  If </p><p>previously there was a perception that the government was </p><p>stalling in its negotiations with the IMF in anticipation of </p><p>completion of the U.S. assistance package, there is now </p><p>belief that the government has put itself at the mercy of the </p><p>IMF, and has no choice but to accept its conditions without </p><p>exception.  ATA Invest Board Member Mehmet Sami and Chief </p><p>Economist Altug Karamenderes told us on March 3 that </p><p>continuance of the IMF program, not "temporary" U.S. </p><p>assistance, remains the most important issue for investors. </p><p>The two saw in Prime Minister Gul\'s morning press conference </p><p>an indication that he understood this reality, and believe </p><p>that indications of progress on the IMF agreement will help </p><p>blunt the vote\'s negative impact on Turkish markets. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Sustainability: Both Sami and Karamenderes </p><p>questioned, however, whether the government will be able to </p><p>sustain this policy in the medium term, pointing out that the </p><p>figures Gul announced in meeting Turkey\'s 6.5 percent primary </p><p>surplus target, while IMF blessed, are very ambitious.  They </p><p>also noted that they represent a shift from AK\'s earlier </p><p>populist stance to agreement to squeeze savings out of the </p><p>public sector, and will be politically difficult.  Most </p><p>critically, a variety of looming factors, including weak </p><p>demand, increasing oil prices, tourism declines, and </p><p>increased military spending, may "strangle growth" and leave </p><p>the government far short of its revenue targets.   The </p><p>cascading challenges, in Sami\'s and Karamenderes\' view, may </p><p>lead the government to "give up" and abandon the program at </p><p>some point this summer or fall.  Alternatively, they </p><p>suggested, the government might at that point move to </p><p>restructure its domestic and foreign debt, or, in a worst </p><p>case scenario, default, a possibility they regarded </p><p>phlegmatically.  "Opportunistic investors are out there </p><p>waiting," they said, arguing that default has lost some of </p><p>its past stigma. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Comment: The vote came as a shock to Istanbul </p><p>markets and observers, and has shaken market confidence.  The </p><p>government\'s quick moves on the IMF front have dampened some </p><p>of that impact, however.  Sami and Karamanderes did note that </p><p>ironically if a second vote were successful the end result </p><p>would be the best of all possible worlds: unblocking of large </p><p>American assistance, but only after the government had pushed </p><p>the IMF program further than it was previously willing to go. </p><p> End Comment. </p><p>ARNETT </p><p></p></div>
