(U) UAE Chief of Staff, and de facto Defense </p><p>Minister, Shaykh Muhammad Bin Zayid Al-Nahyan (MbZ) </p><p>told the Ambassador on July 20 that UAE assistance to </p><p>Iraq already totals USD $50 million.  This </p><p>contribution includes Red Crescent medical and food </p><p>supplies, hospital and medical equipment, continuing </p><p>medical treatment for a number of Iraqis evacuated to </p><p>the UAE in May, and water treatment plants. MbZ </p><p>expects this figure to rise to USD $80 million by the </p><p>end of the year as the Emiratis continue to provide </p><p>the services they have promised. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Comment: The overall UAEG assistance to Iraq </p><p>is substantially greater than just Red Crescent </p><p>contributions (reftel) -- it includes outlays from the </p><p>Defense Ministry as well as ongoing humanitarian </p><p>efforts. The UAEG\'s commitment to Iraqi reconstruction </p><p>has been steadfast, and as MbZ\'s statement indicates, </p><p>will continue to be resolute. End comment. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
