<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L TEGUCIGALPA 002928 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT. FOR WHA/CEN, DS/OP/WHA, AND S/CT </p><p>STATE PASS USTR </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/22/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, ASEC, PREL, PTER, ETRD, PHUM, SOCI, HO </p><p>SUBJECT: PEACEFUL DEMONSTRATION PROTESTS COLUMBUS DAY, </p><p>GLOBALIZATION, AND U.S. POLICIES OUTSIDE EMBASSY TEGUCIGALPA </p><p> </p><p>REF: TEGUCIGALPA 2860 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Chief Francisco Palmieri; </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) On October 11 approximately 100 peaceful demonstrators </p><p>protested outside Embassy Tegucigalpa.  The protesters </p><p>included representatives of the Convergence of Movements of </p><p>the Peoples of America (COMPA), the public university </p><p>worker\'s union (SITRAUNAH), the Civil Council of Indigenous </p><p>and Popular Organizations and Ethnic Groups of Honduras, and </p><p>the loose political alliance known as the Popular Block. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) The demonstrators protested against a number of </p><p>issues, including Columbus Day, Plan Puebla Panama, Plan </p><p>Colombia, the planned Free Trade of the Americas (FTAA), </p><p>globalization, the proposed privatization of municipal water </p><p>services, and U.S. policy on Iraq.  It received front page </p><p>coverage in the major newspapers.  Aldo Mauricio Calderon, a </p><p>journalist for the San Pedro Sula newspaper El Tiempo, helped </p><p>choreograph the protest, something he has done at past </p><p>anti-U.S demonstrations.  Ericka de Ramirez, the reigning </p><p>Miss Honduras from the Garifuna community who has traded </p><p>accusations with pageant organizers, led a similar peaceful </p><p>protest in La Ceiba (the third largest city in Honduras) and </p><p>called for observance of women\'s rights. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Honduran security forces notified RSO in the hours </p><p>prior to the demonstration that two busloads of indigenous </p><p>people had been sighted en route to Tegucigalpa from La </p><p>Esperanza, a town four hours from Tegucigalpa.  The </p><p>approximate number of occupants of the buses matched the </p><p>rough number of indigenous protesters later witnessed in the </p><p>demonstration outside the Embassy.  These "protesters for </p><p>hire" had been allowed to enter the city and after completing </p><p>a peaceful protest were most likely paid for their services </p><p>prior to leaving Tegucigalpa, a pattern that has been </p><p>observed many times in the past.  Post notes that few of the </p><p>demonstrators, other than the leaders, appeared to be from </p><p>Tegucigalpa. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) COMMENT:  While much tamer than protests in previous </p><p>years, the GOH has reacted very nervously to these </p><p>demonstrations.  The Minister of Defense and the Minister of </p><p>Public Security (Police) separately asked if the Embassy was </p><p>noticing an increase in activities by leftists groups in the </p><p>country or whether we had any information about these groups </p><p>arming themselves again a la the 1980\'s armed Patriotic </p><p>Morazan Front.  They acknowledged that their concerns were a </p><p>bit exaggerated but noted that a recent spate of bomb threats </p><p>in Tegucigalpa (directed at government offices) and San Pedro </p><p>Sula had prompted them to ask their intelligence units to </p><p>monitor the situation.  END COMMENT. </p><p>PALMER </p><p></p></div>
