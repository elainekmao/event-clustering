<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HANOI 000376 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV; INL/AAE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: SNAR, PREL, PGOV, PINS, VM, CNARC </p><p>SUBJECT: TAIWAN-VIETNAM DRUG COOPERATION </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A.  Hanoi 117  B.  Hanoi 362 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  SUMMARY:  The drug connection between Vietnam and </p><p>Taiwan is a "chronic, but not large" problem."  A large </p><p>heroin seizure in Taiwan last May was "unprecedented." </p><p>Relations between the Taiwan Ministry of </p><p>Justice/Investigative Bureau (MOJ) liaison officer based in </p><p>Ho Chi Minh City and his GVN counterparts are "good," but </p><p>cooperation is limited.  There is no apparent connection </p><p>between growing tourism and marriage links and drugs.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>DRUG CONNECTION - IT\'S THERE </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  Taiwan Economic and Cultural Office Special </p><p>Assistant Chiang Tsung Cheng told poloff on February 13 that </p><p>while there was "definitely" a drug connection between </p><p>Vietnam and Taiwan, the problem was "much less serious than </p><p>the one we have with the PRC."  (Note:  Despite Chiang\'s </p><p>official title, he said that he was actually from the Taiwan </p><p>MOJ/Investigative Bureau liaison.  While based in Ho Chi </p><p>Minh City, Chiang spends a "few days" in Hanoi about every </p><p>two months.  End note.)  Chiang called the seizure of 60 </p><p>kilograms of heroin in Kaohsiung Harbor coming from Vietnam </p><p>last May "significant."  However, he noted that it was "not </p><p>that large" compared to a 200 kilogram heroin seizure in </p><p>2000 that Taiwan authorities traced back to the PRC.  Taiwan </p><p>authorities viewed the seizure from Vietnam as "very unusual </p><p>- really unprecedented," he asserted.  Taiwan was also </p><p>increasingly concerned about heroin shipped directly from </p><p>Cambodia to Taiwan, Chiang added. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  Chiang said that there was a "slow, but steady" </p><p>trickle of heroin coming into Taiwan from Vietnam.  He noted </p><p>that the heroin does not transit Taiwan; rather, it is </p><p>consumed locally.  While he declined to estimate how much </p><p>heroin entered Taiwan from Vietnam or how much was seized, </p><p>Chiang said that Taiwan law enforcement authorities were </p><p>"quite certain" that the heroin originated in the Golden </p><p>Triangle, transited Vietnam, and made its way to Taiwan </p><p>either via sea or sometimes via air couriers. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  Note:  DEA\'s Hanoi country office views the </p><p>Taiwan connection more seriously than Chiang, noting that </p><p>Taiwanese nationals organized the only clandestine lab ever </p><p>seized in Vietnam.  In addition, DEA regional investigations </p><p>suggest that Taiwanese groups are involved in significant </p><p>drug trafficking in and through Vietnam.  End note </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>LIMITED COOPERATION </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  Chiang said that while relations with counterpart </p><p>GVN law enforcement authorities were "good," there had been </p><p>little genuine cooperation on the Vietnamese side.  Without </p><p>going into specifics, Chiang said that over the past 16 </p><p>months, he had provided "good information quite a few times" </p><p>to counterparts, but he claimed to have "no idea" what, if </p><p>anything, they did with it.  He added that he had "never </p><p>received feedback" from GVN law enforcement authorities on </p><p>what, if any, results had been achieved with information he </p><p>passed to them. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  Chiang said that when he did have information </p><p>worth passing along, he was "reluctant" to pass it to the </p><p>counternarcotics police; he said that he preferred to either </p><p>work through Interpol or the Standing Office of Drug Control </p><p>because "relations are better with those offices."  However, </p><p>Chiang added that, whenever possible, he most preferred to </p><p>provide actionable information back to Taiwan authorities, </p><p>whom he trusts to follow through, make an arrest and/or </p><p>seizure, and give him a full and accurate accounting.  "In </p><p>general, our policy is to make arrests in Taiwan," he added. </p><p>During his tenure, he has not attempted to engage GVN law </p><p>enforcement authorities in any joint investigations. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>TOURISM AND MARRIAGE HAVE LITTLE IMPACT </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU)  In recent years there has been a major surge in </p><p>tourism from Taiwan as well as in marriages of Vietnamese </p><p>women to Taiwanese men (ref b).  Chiang said that </p><p>authorities had not seen any significant increase in the </p><p>drug trade despite the growing amount of "people traffic" </p><p>between Vietnam and Taiwan.  Chiang added that there had not </p><p>been any "documented cases" of marriages leading to drug </p><p>connections or smuggling. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU)  Chiang\'s comments regarding law enforcement </p><p>cooperation were much in line with what those of other </p><p>foreign law enforcement liaison officers based in Vietnam, </p><p>including DEA (ref a).  The Taiwan official\'s experience </p><p>confirms our assessment that the lack of Ministry of Public </p><p>Security cooperation with DEA is not directed only at the </p><p>USG; others are also frustrated in their efforts to engage </p><p>the GVN in meaningful law enforcement cooperation. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p></p></div>
