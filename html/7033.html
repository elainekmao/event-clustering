The GVN views ASEAN as an important </p><p>framework for regional counterterrorism (CT) efforts and has </p><p>consistently voiced support for regional and multilateral </p><p>approaches.  From Vietnam\'s perspective, the recently </p><p>concluded ASEAN Regional Forum intersessional meeting on </p><p>counterterrorism and transnational crime was "very </p><p>successful."  However, the GVN does not appear to view a CT </p><p>leadership role for itself as "appropriate" for the </p><p>foreseeable future.  The GVN does appear interested in </p><p>further pursuing CT on both multilateral and bilateral </p><p>tracks.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>COMMITTED TO COUNTERTERRORISM </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  In past ASEAN fora, Vietnam has demonstrated a firm </p><p>commitment to joint action on CT.  At the Eighth ASEAN </p><p>Summit held in Phnom Penh last November, Prime Minister Phan </p><p>Van Khai noted the need for "further cooperation in the </p><p>fight against transnational crime, especially terrorism, </p><p>which is widely spreading in our region."  At the Second </p><p>ASEAN Regional Forum Intersessional Support Group Meeting, </p><p>held in Hanoi in April 2002, Deputy Foreign Minister Le Cong </p><p>Phung (who co-chaired the meeting) stated the need for ASEAN </p><p>to adopt measures "to strengthen regional cooperation in </p><p>combating terrorism and transnational crimes."  Last July\'s </p><p>35th ASEAN Ministerial Meeting Joint Communiqu "affirmed </p><p>ASEAN member countries\' determination to enhance </p><p>counterterrorism cooperation. . ."  This meeting also </p><p>resulted in the "Joint Declaration for Cooperation to Combat </p><p>International Terrorism between ASEAN and the U.S." </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  According to Ministry of Foreign Affairs ASEAN </p><p>Department (MFA/ASEAN) expert Nguyen Thanh Huy, the GVN "is </p><p>fully committed" to the international struggle against </p><p>terrorism.  (Note:  Huy is a focal point for </p><p>counterterrorism issues within MFA/ASEAN.  End note.)  He </p><p>assessed the first ASEAN Regional Forum intersessional </p><p>meeting on counterterrorism and transnational crime March 20 </p><p>- 22 in Kuala Lumpur as "very successful" from Vietnam\'s </p><p>perspective.  Huy added that the GVN viewed the decision to </p><p>establish a regional CT center in Kuala Lumpur (ref c) was a </p><p>"major step forward."  Huy opined that the meeting also </p><p>helped strengthen ASEAN consensus of opposing terrorism in a </p><p>"collective way."  Separately, Bui Ngoc Anh, Senior </p><p>Researcher at the North America Studies Center of the </p><p>National Center for Social Sciences and Humanities, </p><p>commented that Vietnam had viewed the Kuala Lumpur meeting </p><p>as having a "positive impact" and "reinforcing the need" for </p><p>a multilateral framework to oppose terrorism. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  In addition to the MFA, the GVN\'s delegation to </p><p>the Kuala Lumpur meeting included officials from the </p><p>Ministry Of Defense, Ministry of Public Security, and the </p><p>General Customs Department.  This was "significant," </p><p>according to Huy (who also attended the meeting), because </p><p>delegates from different ministries could (and did) conduct </p><p>"considerable sideline conversations" with their respective </p><p>counterparts from other countries.  Huy noted that delegates </p><p>had discussed the importance of "networking" and </p><p>"intelligence sharing" in order to enhance regional CT </p><p>efforts.  While the GVN "agreed completely" on the need to </p><p>do more of this, Huy admitted that the meeting "did not </p><p>discuss concrete implementation steps."  (Note:  More </p><p>concrete measures may emerge from the ASEAN Senior Officials </p><p>Meeting on Transnational Crimes -- SOMTC -- in Hanoi June 9- </p><p>12 or the SOMTC+US meeting on June 12, which are intended to </p><p>flesh out Brunei\'s Joint Declaration from August 2002.  End </p><p>note.) </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>GVN LEADERSHIP ROLE UNLIKELY </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  Huy and Anh separately stated that Vietnam was </p><p>unlikely to take a leadership role in ASEAN on the CT issue, </p><p>however.  Huy said that, while Vietnam is "definitely" among </p><p>the strongest of the new ASEAN members, taking a leadership </p><p>role would send a signal that the GVN considers terrorism a </p><p>"major problem" in Vietnam.  He commented that GVN leaders </p><p>preferred to highlight Vietnam\'s image as a "safe haven." </p><p>Huy admitted that this view "somewhat contradicts" the GVN\'s </p><p>oft-stated view that terrorism does not adhere to any </p><p>specific boundaries.  However, he opined that the GVN "would </p><p>prefer" to leave the leadership role to countries more "at </p><p>the forefront of terrorism," such as Indonesia, Malaysia, </p><p>and the Philippines.  Anh noted that he would be "very </p><p>surprised" if Vietnam tried to take a more prominent CT role </p><p>within ASEAN.  While Vietnam was indeed "part of the ASEAN </p><p>CT consensus," Anh predicted that it would not be a GVN </p><p>"priority" to take a leadership role on this issue "any time </p><p>soon." </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>SUPPORT WITH AN ASTERISK </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  While Vietnam has reiterated its CT commitment in </p><p>various fora, that support typically contains caveats </p><p>regarding the need to "respect sovereignty" and ensure "non- </p><p>interference" internal affairs.  The ASEAN - U.S. </p><p>Declaration Against Terrorism similarly noted that "all </p><p>actions against terrorism must be taken in accordance with </p><p>international laws, as well as in respect for the principle </p><p>of sovereign equality, territorial integrity, and non- </p><p>interference in the internal affairs of all countries."  The </p><p>North America Studies Center\'s Anh stressed that Vietnam </p><p>"believes strongly" that CT activities should be carried out </p><p>in accordance with "the UN Charter." </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU)  The MFA\'s Huy reaffirmed that the GVN "is also </p><p>committed" to ratifying the remaining four international </p><p>conventions related to terrorism."  MFA Department of Laws </p><p>and Treaties Deputy Director General Nguyen Truong Giang </p><p>also affirmed this commitment to POL/C in March, without </p><p>being able to offer a specific timeframe (ref B).  Giang </p><p>separately confirmed to poloff that Vietnam plans to accede </p><p>to ASEAN\'s "Agreement on Information Exchange and </p><p>Establishment of Communication Procedures" signed last May </p><p>by Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.  "It is only a </p><p>matter of time" until Vietnam accedes, he claimed.  He </p><p>predicted that the GVN will move "relatively quickly" once </p><p>the other countries have ratified the agreement. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>PARALLEL TRACKS </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU)  Huy and Anh each noted that, while Vietnam was </p><p>strongly committed to the multilateral/ASEAN CT approach, </p><p>the GVN\'s policy was to also improve cooperation via the </p><p>bilateral track.  Huy pointed out that recent VIP visits </p><p>between ASEAN leaders have invariably included terrorism on </p><p>their agendas.  He cited the recent visit to Hanoi of Than </p><p>Shwe, Senior General and Chairman of Burma\'s State Peace and </p><p>Development Council, as a case in point (ref D).  Anh added </p><p>that, during Philippine President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo\'s </p><p>brief visit to Vietnam last November, counterterrorism was </p><p>similarly on the agenda during her meetings with the GVN </p><p>leadership.  Anh said that this "parallel approach" was </p><p>"quite normal." </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU)  It is encouraging that the GVN has demonstrated </p><p>its commitment to the CT issue within the ASEAN framework </p><p>and that CT has become a routine agenda item for senior- </p><p>level visits.  It is not surprising that Vietnam has shown </p><p>little interest in assuming a leadership role on the CT </p><p>issue, however; Vietnam tends to play a similar go-along- </p><p>with-the-consensus approach on most other issues within </p><p>ASEAN as well as in APEC, NAM, and UN fora. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p></p></div>
