<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 007980 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA CROCKER, NEA/NGA AND EUR/SE; </p><p>OSD FOR HRHODE; </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH; </p><p>DAMASCUS FOR WALKER </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/06/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MARR, TU, IZ, UNSC </p><p>SUBJECT: IRAQI OPPOSITION: ENSURING TURKMEN FRONT INCLUSION </p><p>IN OPPOSITION ACTIVITIES AND USG STATEMENTS TO GET TURKISH </p><p>SUPPORT FOR REGIME CHANGE </p><p> </p><p> (U) Classified by Ambassador W. Robert Pearson.  Reasons: </p><p>1.5 (B and D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) The November 6 Washington File reported the Department </p><p>spokesman referring to the planned November 22 Iraqi </p><p>opposition conference, listing only the six organizations on </p><p>the conference steering committee as those the USG had been </p><p>working with on the future of Iraq.  He said, "We\'ve been </p><p>working with six different opposition groups on the issue of </p><p>the future of Iraq.  And they\'ve been working, in particular, </p><p>with each other attempting to organize conferences and make </p><p>progress towards examining the future of Iraq from a </p><p>constitutional and democratic basis." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) This statement did not mention, perhaps for very </p><p>understandable reasons, that the Department has been working </p><p>with well over a dozen opposition goups on the future of </p><p>Iraq.  Critically for Ankara, however, failure to publicly </p><p>mention the Iraqi Turkmen Front (ITF) as one of the groups we </p><p>are working with on the future of Iraq will hurt our efforts </p><p>to garner Turkish support for opposition activities and </p><p>regime change in Iraq.  In addition, after the August 9th </p><p>meeting of the six groups on the steering committee, the </p><p>Department made a commitment to Turkey that from that time </p><p>forward, all USG-supported Iraqi opposition activities would </p><p>include the ITF.  The Turks are certain to raise this issue </p><p>with us. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) As we think is well understood, we would like to </p><p>ensure the participation of the Iraqi Turkmen Front in all </p><p>opposition activities and note the ITF\'s invovement in all </p><p>public statements.  As appropriate, we request a public </p><p>disclosure of the invitation for the Turkmen to participate </p><p>November 22, and the fact that we would be glad to have them </p><p>participate. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
