<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 001530 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/11/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PREL, SOCI, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: OUTSIDE AMMAN, MANY FEAR ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES OF </p><p>IRAQ WAR, HOPE FOR MOVEMENT ON MEPP </p><p> </p><p>REF: AMMAN 1336 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMBASSADOR EDWARD GNEHM, REASONS 1.5(B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary.  In March 5 and 6 meetings in Salt and Aqaba </p><p>with Poloff, a number of  prominent Jordanian businessmen and </p><p>politicians provided an "outside-the-beltway" assessment of </p><p>the GOJ\'s recent decision to schedule Parliamentary elections </p><p>in June and the issue on everyone\'s mind, Iraq.  While </p><p>opinions on the importance of setting a date for elections </p><p>ran the gamut from inconsequential to highly important, the </p><p>consensus was that should the war cause instability in </p><p>Jordan, elections might be postponed again.  As to the Iraq </p><p>war, while no one wants war and no one likes Saddam, there is </p><p>concern for the impact such a war will have on the Jordanian </p><p>economy, its people and the region as a whole. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>REACTION TO PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  On March 5 and 6, Poloff visited several prominent </p><p>businessmen, ex-Parliamentarians and one ex Ambassador to </p><p>Iraq in Salt (a medium-sized city 30 minutes from Amman) and </p><p>Aqaba, Jordan\'s port city and a 3 hour drive south of Amman. </p><p> While most of our contacts were enthusiastic about the </p><p>government\'s announcement to hold elections on June 17, many </p><p>wondered whether it was wise to hold them during such a </p><p>"sensitive time."  In response to poloff\'s question </p><p>concerning reaction to the June elections, our contacts (all </p><p>of whom can be counted in the solidly pro-regime column) made </p><p>the following points: </p><p> </p><p>--Average Jordanians are worried about poverty and </p><p>unemployment and many blame the government for this </p><p>predicament.  Their main concern centers around having enough </p><p>money to feed their families.  This situation leaves little </p><p>time to focus on upcoming elections. </p><p> </p><p>--Voter turnout will be low because many people feel </p><p>Parliament is inconsequential in their daily lives. </p><p> </p><p>--The GOJ announced elections as a distraction to keep </p><p>people\'s minds occupied. </p><p> </p><p>--Parliament is ineffective without real political parties. </p><p> </p><p>--The Islamists will do well. The Islamic Action Front (IAF) </p><p>is expected to participate and win a significant minority </p><p>share of seats in the next Parliament. </p><p> </p><p>--As to the six women\'s seats in Parliament, some considered </p><p>it a move in the right direction, while others felt that the </p><p>addition of six or more women to the mix would make no </p><p>difference at all. (Note: All of our interlocutors on these </p><p>visits were male) </p><p> </p><p>All of our contacts believe that the conduct and outcome of a </p><p>war in Iraq will determine whether or not the government will </p><p>ultimately proceed with elections in June. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>IRAQ WAR REACTION </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Referring to the expected war in Iraq, the </p><p>ex-parliamentarian from Salt, Salameh Hiyari, stated that </p><p>people feel frustrated, impotent and unable to express </p><p>themselves because of government restrictions.  He is </p><p>concerned with how quiet people are and worries that such </p><p>unreleased pressure might boil at some future time. Other </p><p>contacts were more concerned with the impact a war in Iraq </p><p>would have on Jordan\'s already difficult economic situation, </p><p>the prospect of Iraqi refugees flowing into the Kingdom and </p><p>the fear that Sharon will take advantage of the situation in </p><p>Iraq and expel Palestinians to Jordan.  While most are deeply </p><p>concerned about the short term impact on Jordan, most also </p><p>expressed guarded optimism that in the long-run, Jordan would </p><p>greatly benefit by participating in much needed </p><p>infrastructure improvements in Iraq and normalization of </p><p>trade between the two countries.  They also hoped the United </p><p>States would be able to provide substantial aid to Jordan to </p><p>cushion the war\'s impact. </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  All our out-of-town contacts reiterated the view that </p><p>being against the war in Iraq is not tantamount to support </p><p>for Saddam Hussein.  Most agreed that the currently high </p><p>level of anti-US sentiment on the street would be minimized </p><p>if the war is quick and Iraqi civilian casualties are kept at </p><p>a minimum.  Further, all vehemently stated that the U.S. </p><p>after the war must quickly re-focus on the </p><p>Israeli-Palestinian issue. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
