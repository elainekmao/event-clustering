HARTER. REASONS 1.5 </p><p>(B) & (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) BEGIN SUMMARY:  ACCORDING TO A LEADING </p><p>GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL WITH LONG EXPERIENCE IN PARTY </p><p>CENTRAL COMMITTEE STAFF WORK, THE NEW PARTY </p><p>SECRETARIAT IS IN FACT A DECISION-MAKING BODY WHICH </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>WORKS CLOSELY WITH THE GENERAL SECRETARY.  IT DOES NOT </p><p>SIMPLY PROVIDE POLICY STUDIES AND PAPERS FOR BROADER </p><p>REVIEW BY THE POLITBURO.  THE POLITBURO ITSELF IS </p><p>APPARENTLY MORE A SYMBOLIC INSTITUTION REPRESENTING </p><p>CONSTITUENCIES WITH TOO INFREQUENT A MEETING SCHEDULE </p><p>FOR IT TO BE AN EFFECTIVE DETERMINANT OF DAY-TO-DAY </p><p>ACTIONS FOR THE PARTY LEADERSHIP.  THIS SAME SOURCE, </p><p>WHILE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE ROLE PARTY GENERAL </p><p>SECRETARY NONG DUC MANH WILL PLAY IN DIRECTING THE </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>PARTY, BELIEVES MANH HAS NOT YET BEEN TESTED AS A </p><p>LEADER CAPABLE OF BRIDGING THE DIFFERING VIEWS OF </p><p>VARIOUS ELEMENTS OF THE PARTY.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  DURING THE COURSE OF A SEPARATE DISCUSSION ON </p><p>BILATERAL RELATIONS WITH NGUYEN THU DO, SENIOR EXPERT </p><p>ON AMERICAS ISSUES IN THE OFFICE OF THE GOVERNMENT, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  01308  02 OF 02  310842Z </p><p>DCM ASKED DO.ABOUT THE ROLE OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY </p><p>SECRETARIAT WHICH WAS RE-ESTABLISHED AT THE NINTH </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>PARTY CONGRESS.  HE ASKED IF THIS BODY HAD ANY </p><p>"POLICY" ROLES OR WHETHER IT WAS MERELY AN EXECUTIVE </p><p>BODY ASSEMBLING AND COORDINATING PAPERS TASKED BY OR </p><p>FOR THE POLITBURO AND THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  DO BEGAN HIS REMARKS BY INDICATING HE </p><p>PREVIOUSLY HAD WORKED FOR THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE AS A </p><p>STAFF EXPERT FOR ABOUT A DECADE AND SAID THE PARTY </p><p>STRUCTURE HAD BEEN EVOLVING OVER THE YEARS, </p><p>PARTICULARLY SINCE THE COLLAPSE OF THE SOVIET UNION </p><p>AND THE EASTERN EUROPEAN COMMUNIST REGIMES.  DURING </p><p>THE EARLIER PERIOD, THE SECRETARIAT HAD </p><p>RESPONSIBILITIES RELATED TO COORDINATING ACTIVITIES </p><p>WITH OTHER COMMUNIST PARTY ORGANIZATIONS.  THERE WAS A </p><p>REGULAR EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION, PLANNING OF </p><p>COOPERATIVE ACTIVITIES, AND DEVELOPMENT OF PARTY-TO- </p><p>PARTY RELATIONS.  INSIDE VIETNAM AT THAT TIME, PARTY </p><p>POLICIES WERE PARAMOUNT AND THE GOVERNMENT WAS SIMPLY </p><p>AN EXECUTIVE ARM FOR THE PARTY WITH VIRTUALLY NO </p><p>AUTHORITY OF ITS OWN.  HE NOTED THAT THE LATE PM PHAM </p><p>VAN DONG HAD SAID HE WAS THE LONGEST SERVING PRIME </p><p>MINISTER IN THE REGION, BUT HE HAD LESS POWER THAN </p><p>ANYBODY ELSE BECAUSE OF THE LIMITED ABILITY OF THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT TO ACT WITHOUT SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS FROM </p><p>THE VIETNAMESE COMMUNIST PARTY. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  WITH THE COLLAPSE OF THE OTHER COMMUNIST </p><p>REGIMES, THE SECRETARIAT BECAME MUCH MORE OF A </p><p>COORDINATING ARM OF THE POLITBURO AND THE CENTRAL </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  01308  02 OF 02  310842Z </p><p>COMMITTEE.  IT DID, HOWEVER, GRADUALLY ASSUME A POWER </p><p>ROLE LINKED TO THE GENERAL SECRETARY.  IT BECAME LESS </p><p>AND LESS RESPONSIVE TO THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE AND OTHER </p><p>MEMBERS OF THE POLITBURO. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  BECAUSE IT WAS ISOLATED FROM THE COMMITTEE </p><p>AND HAD BECOME A POWER BASE IN ITS OWN RIGHT, THERE </p><p>WAS INCREASING CRITICISM OF THIS BODY FROM OTHER </p><p>ELEMENTS OF THE PARTY LEADERSHIP AND FROM WITHIN THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT.  (DO REFERRED TO THE PREVIOUS SECRETARIAT </p><p>AS A BUNCH OF OLD MEN FOCUSED ON THE PAST AND TIED TO </p><p>THE GENERAL SECRETARY.)  DOI MOI REFORMS IN THE LATE </p><p>1980\'S HAD GIVEN THE GOVERNMENT MORE RESPONSIBILITY, </p><p>AND THERE WAS MORE ACTIVITY ON THE PART OF MINISTRIES </p><p>AND EVEN THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY.  THE IDEA TO CREATE A </p><p>STANDING COMMITTEE OF THE POLITBURO AT THE PREVIOUS </p><p>CONGRESS IN 1996 WAS THE RESULT OF DISSATISFACTION </p><p>WITH THE ROLE OF THE SECRETARIAT AND A BELIEF THAT </p><p>THERE NEEDED TO BE A BROADER, MORE INDEPENDENT BODY </p><p>OPERATING AT THE TOP. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  THE SET-UP OF THE FIVE-PERSON STANDING </p><p>COMMITTEE WITH LE KHA PHIEU AS GENERAL SECRETARY IN </p><p>1997 DID NOT BRING A SATISFACTORY SOLUTION TO THE </p><p>PROBLEM EITHER.  THE COMPOSITION OF THE GROUP, PARTY </p><p>GENERAL SECRETARY, PRESIDENT, PRIME MINISTER, NATIONAL </p><p>ASSEMBLY CHAIRMAN, AND DIRECTOR OF THE FATHERLAND </p><p>FRONT WHICH OVERSEES OFFICIAL MASS ORGANIZATIONS, </p><p>ITSELF BECAME TOO ISOLATED FROM THE REST OF THE </p><p>CENTRAL COMMITTEE.  IT WAS EMPOWERED TO ACT IN THE </p><p>ABSENCE OF THE POLITBURO BEING CONVENED BUT IT LACKED </p><p>A STRONG CONSENSUS OF ITS OWN.  IT HAD POWER, HE SAID, </p><p>BUT IT RARELY SEEMED TO USE THAT POWER EFFECTIVELY. </p><p>THIS IN PART, HE ARGUED, RESULTED IN VERY LIMITED </p><p>CREATIVITY IN DECISION-MAKING DURING THE LE KHA PHIEU </p><p>ERA. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  DURING THE RUN-UP TO THE NINTH PARTY </p><p>CONGRESS, DO SAID, THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF DEBATE </p><p>ABOUT RECREATING THE SECRETARIAT AND DISCUSSION ABOUT </p><p>ITS ASSUMPTION OF AUTHORITY WITHIN THE TOP PARTY </p><p>CIRCLES.  DCM ASKED IF THE NEWLY RE-CREATED </p><p>SECRETARIAT THEN WAS SLATED TO BECOME A STAFF UNIT </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>PREPARING MATERIALS FOR THE GENERAL CONSIDERATION OF </p><p>THE POLITBURO AT LARGE, THEREBY TRANSFERRING THE </p><p>DECISION-MAKING ROLE OF THE FIVE-MEMBER STANDING </p><p>COMMITTEE TO THE LARGER GROUP FOR ACTION.  DO SAID </p><p>THIS WAS NOT THE CASE AT ALL.  THE POLITBURO, HE </p><p>ASSERTED, IS JUST "A BUNCH OF HATS."  THEY REPRESENT </p><p>"CONSTITUENCIES" WITHIN VIETNAM.  "THE INDIVIDUALS </p><p>HAVE STATUS AND PRESTIGE, BUT THEY DO NOT HAVE THE </p><p>CHIEF POWER," HE SAID.  "THEY MEET AT BEST ONCE A </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  01308  02 OF 02  310814Z </p><p>WEEK, MORE LIKELY ONLY ONCE A MONTH OR SO."  REAL </p><p>"DECISION-MAKING AUTHORITY" IS IN FACT VESTED "IN THE </p><p>SECRETARIAT AND THE GENERAL SECRETARY" WITHIN THE </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>BROADLY ESTABLISHED PARTY GUIDELINES SET DOWN BY THE </p><p>POLITBURO AND THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE.  "THIS IS WHY," </p><p>HE SAID, "VU KHOAN\'S ROLE (AS HEAD OF THE SECRETARIAT) </p><p>IS SO IMPORTANT TODAY."  SECRETARIAT MEMBERSHIP IS </p><p>ALSO REFLECTIVE OF CONSTITUENCIES, BUT THE GENERALLY </p><p>YOUNGER FIGURES OCCUPYING THOSE POSITIONS MEANS A MUCH </p><p>MORE FLEXIBLE APPROACH TO POLICY WILL BE POSSIBLE IN </p><p>THE FUTURE.  (COMMENT:  DO PROBABLY IS REFLECTING HERE </p><p>MORE THE HOPE OF WHAT THE SECRETARIAT MIGHT BECOME, </p><p>BECAUSE OF ITS COMPOSITION, THAN THE ACTUAL POWER ROLE </p><p>IT HAS CURRENTLY ASSUMED.  END COMMENT) </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  DCM ASKED DO IF HE SENSED THERE HAD ALREADY </p><p>BEEN SIGNS OF CHANGE IN THIS RESPECT SINCE THE NEW </p><p>GROUP HAD ASSUMED POWER.  DO SAID HE FELT THE SIGNS </p><p>WERE OPTIMISTIC AND HE HAD "GOOD FEELINGS" ABOUT THE </p><p>LEADERSHIP OF NONG DUC MANH.  AFTER A BRIEF DISCUSSION </p><p>OF THE ROLE OF MANH IN LEADING THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY </p><p>TO BE A MORE ASSERTIVE BODY IN THE POLITICAL STRUCTURE </p><p>ON THE GOVERNMENT SIDE, DO CONCLUDED THAT MANH WAS </p><p>CLEARLY A "GOOD LISTENER." HE IS "OPEN TO A WIDE </p><p>RANGE OF IDEAS," HE SAID, "BUT WE HAVE YET TO SEE </p><p>ENOUGH OF HIM AS A DECISION-MAKER TO BE ABLE TO DECIDE </p><p>HOW WELL HE WILL DO."  WHEN HE WAS RUNNING THE </p><p>NATIONAL ASSEMBLY, THERE WERE NOT A LOT OF TRULY BIG </p><p>ISSUES THAT HAD TO BE RESOLVED.  "THERE ARE STILL A </p><p>LOT OF GROUPS AND CONSTITUENCIES WHICH MUST BE HEARD </p><p>AND THEIR VIEWS BALANCED IN SUCH A WAY AS TO KEEP THEM </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  01308  02 OF 02  310814Z </p><p>ALL PART OF THE CONSENSUS ON PARTY POLICIES."  DO </p><p>IMPLIED THIS WOULD NOT BE AN EASY TASK AND, WHILE HE </p><p>IS OPTIMISTIC ABOUT MANH\'S ABILITIES, HE REMAINS </p><p>UNCERTAIN ABOUT HOW WELL MANH WILL BE ABLE TO PULL THE </p><p>VARIOUS ELEMENTS TOGETHER. </p><p> </p><p>PETERSON </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
