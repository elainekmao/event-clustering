<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ISLAMABAD 010938 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>S/CT FOR REAP/COLLINS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS:  PTER, PK </p><p>SUBJECT:  PAKISTAN:  1995 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT </p><p> </p><p>REF:  STATE 245276 </p><p> </p><p>1.  REFTEL REQUESTED INFORMATION FOR THE DEPARTMENT\'S </p><p>PREPARATION OF THE ANNUAL REPORT TO CONGRESS ON INTERNATIONAL </p><p>TERRORISM.  THE FOLLOWING RESPONSES ARE KEYED TO THE QUESTIONS </p><p>IN PARA 3 OF REFTEL. </p><p> </p><p>2. A.  HOST GOVERNMENT PROSECUTIONS OF TERRORISTS. </p><p> </p><p>IN NOVEMBER 1995, A KARACHI COURT CONVICTED 13 MEMBERS OF AN </p><p>EXTREMIST SUNNI MUSLIM GROUP AND SENTENCED THEM TO DEATH FOR </p><p>ATTACKS ON TWO SHIA MOSQUES IN KARACHI IN EARLY 1995.  WE ARE </p><p>UNAWARE OF ANY PROSECUTIONS IN PAKISTAN IN 1995 ON CHARGES OF </p><p>INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>3. B.  HOST GOVERNMENT EXTRADITIONS OF TERRORISTS. </p><p> </p><p>THE GOP ACTED SWIFTLY AND IN CLOSE COOPERATION WITH THE USG IN </p><p>FEBRUARY 1995 TO EXTRADITE TO THE U.S. SUSPECTED WORLD TRADE </p><p>CENTER BOMBER RAMZI AHMAD YOUSEF.  INTERIOR MINISTER NASERULLAH </p><p>BABAR HAS SAID PUBLICLY THAT PAKISTAN HAS EXTRADITED TEN </p><p>SUSPECTED EGYPTIAN TERRORISTS TO EGYPT. </p><p> </p><p>4. C.  IMPEDIMENTS TO EXTRADITION/PROSECUTION OF TERRORISTS. </p><p> </p><p>THE "TRIBAL AREAS" OF PAKISTAN BORDERING ON AFGHANISTAN DO NOT </p><p>FALL UNDER THE WRIT OF PAKISTANI LAW AND ARE NOT UNDER THE </p><p>CONTROL OF THE PAKISTAN GOVERNMENT.  IT IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT </p><p>FOR THE GOP TO APPREHEND SUSPECTED TERRORISTS WHO TAKE REFUGE </p><p>IN THESE REMOTE, MOUNTAINOUS AREAS. </p><p> </p><p>ALTHOUGH FEDERAL AUTHORITIES HAVE BEEN COOPERATIVE ON </p><p>COUNTERTERRORISM ISSUES, MANY POLICE OFFICIALS WITH PRIMARY </p><p>AUTHORITY FOR INVESTIGATING TERRORIST CASES AND APPREHENDING </p><p>SUSPECTED TERRORISTS ARE NEITHER WELL-TRAINED NOR </p><p>WELL-MOTIVATED TO CONDUCT ANTI-TERRORISM INVESTIGATIONS AND </p><p>OPERATIONS.  PAKISTANI COUNTERTERRORISM INVESTIGATIONS AND </p><p>OPERATIONS ARE ALSO LIMITED DUE TO BUDGETARY CONSTRAINTS. </p><p> </p><p>INFLUENTIAL ISLAMIC POLITICAL PARTIES PUBLICLY OPPOSE GOP </p><p>COOPERATION WITH THE U.S. AND OTHER COUNTRIES AGAINST </p><p>TERRORISM, TERMING SUCH COOPERATION AN OPERATION AGAINST ISLAM. </p><p> </p><p>5. D.  RESPONSES OTHER THAN PROSECUTION. </p><p> </p><p>THE GOP HAS COOPERATED IN THE ONGOING USG INVESTIGATION OF THE </p><p>MARCH 8, 1995 MURDER IN KARACHI OF TWO AMERICAN EMPLOYEES OF </p><p>THE CONSULATE GENERAL, AND ACCEPTED U.S. ASSISTANCE IN THE </p><p>INVEQEMBER 19, 1995, BOMBING OF THE EGYPTIAN </p><p>EMBASSY IN ISLAMABAD.  THE GOP GRANTED A WAIVER OF SPECIALITY </p><p>FOR ADDITIONAL CHARGES TO BE BROUGHT AGAINST RAMZI AHMAD YOUSEF </p><p>FOR HIS ALLEGED ROLE IN PLOTS TO BLOW UP AIRCRAFT IN ASIA. </p><p> </p><p>6. E.  CT EFFORTS UNDERTAKEN IN 1995. </p><p> </p><p>DURING HER TRIP TO WASHINGTON IN APRIL 1995, PRIME MINISTER </p><p>BENAZIR BHUTTO OFFERED PAKISTAN\'S FULL COOPERATION AGAINST </p><p>INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM.  INTERIOR MINISTER BABAR HAS </p><p>SUBSEQUENTLY REITERATED THAT PLEDGE OF COOPERATION.  DURING </p><p>1995, GOP OFFICIALS CLAIMED THAT THE GOP CLOSED DOWN SOME </p><p>PAKISTANI OFFICES OF KASHMIRI MILITANT GROUPS. </p><p> </p><p>7. F.  SIGNIFICANT SUPPORT FOR INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>THE INDIAN GOVERNMENT ACCUSES THE GOP OF PROVIDING TRAINING AND </p><p>MATERIAL SUPPORT TO MILITANTS OPERATING IN INDIAN-HELD JAMMU </p><p>AND KASHMIR AND ELSEWHERE IN INDIA. </p><p> </p><p>GOP OFFICIALS HAVE STATED PUBLICLY THAT, WHILE THE GOP PROVIDES </p><p>DIPLOMATIC, POLITICAL, AND MORAL SUPPORT FOR KASHMIR, IT IS </p><p>FIRMLY AGAINST TERRORISM AND PROVIDES NO TRAINING OR MATERIAL </p><p>SUPPORT FOR KASHMIRI MILITANTS.  HOWEVER, ANTI-INDIAN MILITANT </p><p>GROUPS OPERATE FREELY IN PAKISTAN AND ARE PERMITTED TO RAISE </p><p>FUNDS AND RECRUIT NEW CADRE.  THIS POLICY CREATES FERTILE </p><p>GROUND FOR THE OPERATIONS OF OTHER MILITANT AND TERRORIST </p><p>GROUPS IN PAKISTAN. </p><p> </p><p>THE GOP ALSO ACCUSES THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA OF SUPPORTING </p><p>TERRORIST ACTS ON PAKISTANI TERRITORY, PARTICULARLY IN KARACHI. </p><p> </p><p>8. G.  PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>WE ARE UNAWARE OF ANY GOP STATEMENTS DURING 1995 IN SUPPORT OF </p><p>INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM OR TERRORIST ACTS.  SEVERAL HIGH GOP </p><p>OFFICIALS, INCLUDING PRIME MINISTER BENAZIR BHUTTO AND </p><p>PRESIDENT FAROOQ LEGHARI, DURING THE YEAR CONDEMNED TERRORISM </p><p>IN GENERAL AND SPECIFIC ACTS OF TERRORISM, INCLUDING THE MURDER </p><p>OF TWO U.S. CONSULATE GENERAL EMPLOYEES IN KARACHI, THE </p><p>KIDNAPPING OF FOREIGN TOURISTS IN INDIAN-HELD KASHMIR AND THE </p><p>MURDER OF ONE HOSTAGE, THE ASSASSINATION OF ISRAELI PRIME </p><p>MINISTER RABIN, THE BOMBING OF THE OPM/SANG OFFICE IN RIYADH, </p><p>AND THE BOMBING OF THE EGYPTIAN EMBASSY IN ISLAMABAD. </p><p> </p><p>9. H.  SIGNIFICANT CHANGE SINCE 1994. </p><p> </p><p>THERE HAS BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN GOP COUNTERTERRORISM </p><p>POLICY IN 1995, ALTHOUGH GOP OFFICIALS HAVE EXPRESSED AN </p><p>INCREASED WILLINGNESS TO COOPERATE WITH THE U.S. AND OTHER </p><p>COUNTRIES AGAINST TERRORISM.  THE BROWN AMENDMENT, IF/WHEN </p><p>SIGNED INTO LAW, WILL PERMIT EXPANDED U.S. COUNTERTERRORISM </p><p>ASSISTANCE TO PAKISTAN AND MAKE COUNTERTERRORISM COOPERATION </p><p>EASIER. </p><p> </p><p>END OF ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HOLZMAN </p><p></p></div>
