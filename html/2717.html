<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 07 KATHMANDU 000685 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR SA, SA/PAB, SA/INS, SA/RA AND OES/PCI (SALZBERG) </p><p>DEPT PLEASE PASS AID/ANE (J WILSON) AND OFDA (G HAVENS) </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: SENV, EAID, EAGR, ECON, SOCI, PK, IN, AF, XD, REO </p><p>SUBJECT: DROUGHT ASSESSMENT/MITIGATION IN WESTERN S ASIA </p><p> </p><p>REFS: A) ISLAMABAD 2069  B) KATHMANDU 371  C) STATE 31622 </p><p> </p><p>1.  In response to ref a, the Regional Environment Office </p><p>(REO) for South Asia in Kathmandu offers the following </p><p>proposal on drought assessment and mitigation for selected </p><p>regions of India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan.  While we </p><p>have used the format prescribed by ref c, REO would also </p><p>like to submit this proposal to the South Asia Bureau for </p><p>funding consideration under FY02 ESF (in addition to the </p><p>proposals contained in ref b), as well as to AID/ANE and </p><p>OFDA.  This proposal will include a rapid drought </p><p>assessment and identification of short-to-medium term </p><p>mitigation measures for the ongoing drought in Western </p><p>South Asia.  It is intended to complement the Adaptive </p><p>Strategies study, which has recently been approved for </p><p>funding under FY01 South Asia Bureau ESF. The implementing </p><p>agency would be the International Water management </p><p>Institute (IMWI), with headquarters in Colombo, a regional </p><p>office in Lahore, and project office in Vidhyanagar, </p><p>Gujarat. </p><p> </p><p>2.  IWMI\'s proposal as elaborated in collaboration with </p><p>the Regional Environment Office for South Asia: </p><p> </p><p>A.  Project Title: Drought Assessment and Potential for </p><p>Mitigation in Western South Asia </p><p> </p><p>B.  Department Strategic Objective: </p><p> </p><p>The project addresses several Department strategic </p><p>objectives: </p><p> </p><p>-- To render humanitarian assistance where needed </p><p>-- To foster regional stability </p><p>-- To safeguard the environment </p><p>-- To promote sustainable economic development and </p><p>livelihoods in developing countries. </p><p> </p><p>This project aims to promote greater political, economic </p><p>and social stability in drought-ravaged and politically </p><p>volatile western parts of South Asia (Afghanistan, </p><p>Pakistan and western India).  A collaborative assessment </p><p>of current drought conditions will be followed by </p><p>identification of tangible solutions and strategies for: </p><p>-- Addressing immediate needs/alleviating severe impacts </p><p>-- Addressing long term needs for mitigative measures, </p><p>drought preparedness and sustainable water resources </p><p>planning and management. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>C. Problem/Issue: </p><p> </p><p>South and Southwest Asia has been affected by a persistent </p><p>multi-year drought.  From a global perspective, this </p><p>represents the largest region of persistent precipitation </p><p>deficits over the last four years.  More than 100 million </p><p>people have been affected in the region, with severe </p><p>impacts being felt in Gujarat and Rajasthan states in </p><p>India, Pakistan\'s Sind and Baluchistan provinces, and in </p><p>large swaths of Afghanistan and Iran.  Political </p><p>instability, war and economic isolation have further </p><p>exacerbated the effects of drought. </p><p> </p><p>Afghanistan is particularly vulnerable, having witnessed </p><p>over two decades of war and civil strife that has been </p><p>further complicated by the operations of entrenched </p><p>terrorist groups inside Afghanistan and the international </p><p>action against them, as well as the recent earthquake in </p><p>northern Afghanistan.  Pakistan has also been experiencing </p><p>economic and social disruptions that pose difficulties for </p><p>the Government\'s fight against international terrorism and </p><p>domestic religious extremism. In India, drought and flood- </p><p>prone Gujarat has recently seen the worst communal </p><p>violence in a decade. </p><p> </p><p>The severity and persistence of the drought has produced a </p><p>wide range of impacts across the region.  In many areas, </p><p>there is widespread scarcity of potable water as well as </p><p>depleted supplies for irrigation, industry and sanitation. </p><p>Agricultural production has been severely affected, and </p><p>there has been a significant reduction in the livestock </p><p>populations that are the mainstay of subsistence </p><p>livelihoods, especially in Afghanistan. Large population </p><p>movements due to the combination of drought and civil </p><p>strife have aggravated and compounded these miseries for </p><p>communities, often with disproportionate impacts on women </p><p>and children. </p><p> </p><p>Given the magnitude and persistence of this drought, </p><p>severe impacts such as degradation of soil and vegetation, </p><p>increased vulnerability to flooding, and depletion in </p><p>groundwater stocks will likely persist even after a return </p><p>to normal precipitation.  Reduction of seed stocks may </p><p>also impact agricultural communities\' capacity to recover </p><p>once the drought ends.  The continuing political </p><p>instability in the region and social and economic </p><p>pressures may exacerbate these impacts even further.  With </p><p>increasing population, these regions face serious problems </p><p>of overall water shortages and scarcity that must be </p><p>addressed immediately, because failure to act now will </p><p>greatly compound the cost and complexity of later remedial </p><p>efforts. </p><p> </p><p>The ability of governments in the region and international </p><p>relief agencies to deal with this situation is constrained </p><p>by the absence of reliable data, information networks, and </p><p>professional and institutional capacities.  There is an </p><p>urgent need for a full assessment of the drought situation </p><p>and possible relief efforts, and a longer-term need to </p><p>address the problem of overall water scarcity through </p><p>improved and sustainable management of available water </p><p>resources. </p><p> </p><p>The proposed project will review and update information on </p><p>the drought situation in western parts of South Asia </p><p>(Afghanistan, Pakistan and western India) by analyzing </p><p>hydrological and human factors, and recommend concrete and </p><p>tangible steps for future management of droughts: short, </p><p>medium and long-term measures. </p><p> </p><p>However, effective use of climate information in drought </p><p>management and response will require a sustained </p><p>interaction between climate analysts, impact specialists, </p><p>local planners and humanitarian relief agencies.  There is </p><p>also an urgent need to improve the climate observation </p><p>network in the region, as well as to develop mechanisms to </p><p>make such data available for timely input into climate </p><p>forecasting models. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>D.  Anticipated Results: </p><p> </p><p>The project will result in the following outputs: </p><p> </p><p>-- A report assessing the drought situation in western </p><p>parts of South Asia (Afghanistan, Pakistan and western </p><p>India) and identifying potential solutions to alleviate </p><p>drought stress in the short, medium, and long term. </p><p> </p><p>-- An interim "action strategy" for regional governments, </p><p>relief agencies and local communities to manage and </p><p>mitigate severe effects of drought.  This will include </p><p>developing effective drought management guidelines and </p><p>promoting appropriate land and water management </p><p>technologies and systems to mitigate the impact of future </p><p>droughts. </p><p> </p><p>-- An analysis of present coping strategies for droughts </p><p>in the respective countries chosen, and lessons learned. </p><p> </p><p>-- Development of a Decision Support Tool for planning </p><p>drought mitigation and to map out drought vulnerability </p><p>regions, using Remote Sensing and GIS. </p><p> </p><p>-- Identification of institutional and policy gaps in </p><p>drought management and mitigation and, with stakeholders\' </p><p>participation, suggesting ways and means to improve </p><p>mitigation efforts. </p><p> </p><p>-- Development of a project proposal intended to lead to a </p><p>detailed, long-term program of action involving key </p><p>players in drought management and mitigation. </p><p> </p><p>The project will be conducted in a collaborative and </p><p>participatory manner involving national government </p><p>agencies, the local public and other stakeholders affected </p><p>by the drought.  The project intends to promote a sense of </p><p>unity and goodwill in the region as a whole and generate </p><p>motivation to work together to fight against the common </p><p>enemy, drought.  In particular, we expect the following </p><p>longer-term outcomes: </p><p>-- Improved regional coordination in assessing and </p><p>addressing drought. </p><p> </p><p>-- Greater trust and cooperation among the three countries </p><p>to address critical transboundary environmental </p><p>conditions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.  How this project will advance U.S. interests: </p><p> </p><p>The U.S. Government\'s top priority is to defeat terrorism </p><p>in all its forms.  Linked to this a vital U.S. interest in </p><p>fostering stability in South Asia.  U.S. strategic goals </p><p>in the region include helping to rebuild Afghanistan and </p><p>its institutions, promoting political stability and </p><p>democracy in Pakistan and encouraging peaceful dialogue </p><p>between India and Pakistan. </p><p> </p><p>The knowledge, tools and information networks that this </p><p>project will produce will further these objectives.  In </p><p>the short term, regional governments and the international </p><p>relief agencies will be able to take cost-effective </p><p>measures to deal with the severe effects of drought.  In </p><p>the medium term, timely collection, analysis and sharing </p><p>of data, and the development and application of decision </p><p>support tools will result in improved predictability and </p><p>preparedness for droughts, reducing the financial and </p><p>political costs of mitigation to society.  In the long </p><p>term, improved and sustainable planning and management of </p><p>water resources will contribute to a reduction of </p><p>conflicts within societies and lessen tensions over water </p><p>between countries. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>F.  Contribution to political and economic stability: </p><p> </p><p>Senior U.S. policy makers and analysts have described </p><p>South Asia as one of the most dangerous places in the </p><p>contemporary world.  The long-standing dispute over </p><p>Kashmir has dogged the two nuclear-armed rivals, India and </p><p>Pakistan, for the greater part of the last 53 years, </p><p>sending the two countries repeatedly into war.  At this </p><p>moment, the bulk of the armies of the two countries are </p><p>amassed on either side of their common border. </p><p> </p><p>In the wake of the September 11 tragedy, the global nature </p><p>of instability in South Asia and its links to U.S. </p><p>security have become ever more clear.  Despite the defeat </p><p>of the Taliban and al-Qaeda forces, threats of terrorist </p><p>attacks against American interests remain.  Religious </p><p>extremists continue to pose a danger to Pakistan\'s secular </p><p>order. </p><p> </p><p>In the long run, however, the countries of the region are </p><p>bound to each other by shared space and common interests, </p><p>which cannot be addressed without a degree of cooperation. </p><p>Fortunately, the scientific community and many civil </p><p>society organizations in both India and Pakistan are </p><p>willing to engage each other in a constructive dialogue to </p><p>begin to address issues of vital importance to people </p><p>living in both countries.  The impact of the current </p><p>drought constitutes an opportunity for professional and </p><p>scientific circles to collaborate in dealing with this </p><p>common problem.  At a recent conference of the South Asian </p><p>Water Forum (SAWAF) in Katmandu, Nepal, delegates from all </p><p>South Asian countries underlined the need for regional </p><p>experts to work in concert to address non-political cross- </p><p>border issues, such as water and drought management. </p><p> </p><p>For reasons of recent history, relations between Pakistan </p><p>and the new interim government in Afghanistan are at best </p><p>tenuous, despite the declaration of a new beginning by </p><p>both governments.  The best way to translate good </p><p>intentions into good practice is through confidence- </p><p>building measures, starting with important and non- </p><p>contentious issues such as drought management.  The </p><p>present proposal is intended to build vital bridges of </p><p>confidence between these neighbors whose long-term social, </p><p>economic and environmental interest are inter-linked by </p><p>rivers, mountains and other vital ecological systems.  The </p><p>project will also contribute to reducing political and </p><p>military tensions by engaging scientists, practitioners </p><p>and policymakers from all three countries to use their </p><p>knowledge and skills in resolving issues of common long- </p><p>term interest to the whole region. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>G. Proposed recipients of funds: </p><p> </p><p>The International Water Management Institute (IWMI) will </p><p>be the recipient of the funds.  The proposed vehicle for </p><p>obligating the funds is a grant to the Headquarters of </p><p>IWMI, located in Colombo, Sri Lanka.  IWMI - HQ will </p><p>manage and account for the funds and implement the project </p><p>through its regional office in Lahore, Pakistan and </p><p>project office in Vidhyanagar, Gujarat, India. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>H. Detailed project Description: </p><p> </p><p>Purpose and Objectives: </p><p> </p><p>The purpose of the project is to carry out a rapid </p><p>scientific assessment of the drought situation in the </p><p>region and recommend concrete and tangible solutions: </p><p>immediate, medium and long-term measures to address the </p><p>problem.  The project will also be an effort to prepare </p><p>the groundwork for a larger initiative, linking local and </p><p>regional efforts in drought management to global networks </p><p>in climate forecasting and improving disaster relief </p><p>planning and operations. </p><p> </p><p>The project has two specific objectives: </p><p> </p><p>(1) Develop an interim "action strategy" for managing and </p><p>mitigating the severe effects of drought for regional </p><p>governments, relief agencies and local communities.  This </p><p>will include developing effective drought management </p><p>guidelines and promoting appropriate land and water </p><p>management technology and management systems to mitigate </p><p>the impacts of future droughts, and </p><p> </p><p>(2) Develop a detailed proposal for a regional initiative. </p><p>With support from donors, international research </p><p>organizations, and development banks, this would bring </p><p>together expertise from several related fields, bridge </p><p>gaps in current knowledge, and establish a framework for </p><p>researchers, practitioners, and policymakers to develop </p><p>and implement an effective drought management plan in the </p><p>region.   Especially in Afghanistan, capacity-building is </p><p>an important need not yet built-in as a specific objective </p><p>for this project, but to be included in the larger </p><p>initiative. </p><p> </p><p>Research sites: </p><p> </p><p>The project will focus on three typical provinces of the </p><p>chosen countries where drought occurs frequently.  The </p><p>possible candidate sites are Kutch or Saurashtra region in </p><p>Gujarat, India; Baluchistan or Sind in Pakistan; and Balkh </p><p>or Faryab provinces in Afghanistan. </p><p> </p><p>Research Methodology and activities: </p><p> </p><p>Many quantitative measures of drought have been developed, </p><p>of which the most frequently used are those developed by </p><p>Wayne Palmer of U.S.A. in the 1960s.  These include the </p><p>Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), the Palmer </p><p>Hydrological Drought Index (PHDI), the Palmer Z-index and </p><p>the Crop Moisture Index (CMI).  Among these, the PDSI is </p><p>superior in that it accounts not only for precipitation </p><p>totals, but also for temperature, evapotranspiration, </p><p>surface run off and soil recharge. The CMI measures short- </p><p>term agricultural drought on a weekly scale. The project </p><p>will use these and other advanced techniques to measure </p><p>the severity of the drought situation in the region.  The </p><p>project will: </p><p> </p><p>-- Review long term hydrological, meteorological and human- </p><p>related factors affecting drought, and will carry out an </p><p>analysis of drought characteristics, frequency of </p><p>occurrence, severity, and management- institutional- and </p><p>policy-related gaps in drought mitigation programs. </p><p> </p><p>-- Study the coping strategies adopted by various </p><p>stakeholders in mitigating the drought and document what </p><p>happens during a drought, as this is the time people learn </p><p>(or don\'t learn) how to adapt to shortages. Such research- </p><p>based information would be useful in facing future </p><p>droughts. </p><p> </p><p>-- Assess hot spots through the use of remote sensing and </p><p>field surveys to study crop failure, the variety of means </p><p>adopted to relieve water shortages, out-migration </p><p>(including movement of cattle and livestock), and coping </p><p>strategies for meeting drinking water requirements. </p><p> </p><p>-- Document successful innovative procedures adopted by </p><p>people, NGOs, government agencies and aid-agencies in </p><p>mitigating drought and disseminate this information </p><p>through cross-border exchanges. </p><p> </p><p>-- Rely mainly on secondary data collected from various </p><p>sources, in addition to carrying out selected field survey </p><p>using techniques such as process documentation, </p><p>questionnaire surveys, and focus group discussions with </p><p>actors involved in the process at all levels.  Data will </p><p>also be collected using remote sensing techniques.  All </p><p>collected data will be put into a GIS format to develop a </p><p>Decision Support Tool. </p><p> </p><p>IMWI will conduct a final workshop during which national </p><p>government agencies, international experts, donor </p><p>representatives, and national and international disaster </p><p>relief organizations will discuss suggestions advanced, </p><p>exchange information and chart out a "Way Forward." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>I. Performance targets and period of performance: </p><p> </p><p>Preparation: </p><p>(1) Identification and consultation with key players and </p><p>stakeholders: 2 months </p><p>(2) Final selection of the research sites: 3 months </p><p>(3) Fine-tune research methodology, research questions and </p><p>computer models: 3 months </p><p> </p><p>Implementation: </p><p>(1) Data collection and analysis: 6 months </p><p>(2) Draft report on the assessment of the drought </p><p>situation: 9 months </p><p>(3) Draft report on coping strategies, assessing the </p><p>capacity and effectiveness of respective agencies as well </p><p>as community efforts: 12 months </p><p> </p><p>Completion and dissemination: </p><p>(1) Development of a Decision Support Tool for planning </p><p>drought mitigation and mapping out drought vulnerability </p><p>regions, using Remote Sensing and GIS: 18 months </p><p>(2) Identification of institutional and policy gaps in </p><p>drought management and mitigation and, with stakeholders\' </p><p>participation, suggesting ways and means to improve </p><p>mitigation efforts: 18 months </p><p>(3) Development of a project proposal intended to lead to </p><p>a detailed action program for long-term drought management </p><p>in the region: 18 months </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>J.  Assumptions: </p><p> </p><p>The security situation inside Afghanistan will improve </p><p>sufficiently in the coming months for scientific personnel </p><p>to travel and to collect relevant data. </p><p> </p><p>The government of Afghanistan will develop adequate </p><p>capacity to participate meaningfully in the final workshop </p><p>and subsequent multi-party initiative. </p><p> </p><p>Diplomatic approaches can overcome barriers to travel </p><p>between India and Pakistan, in order to permit the </p><p>meaningful participation of Indian and Pakistani partners. </p><p>Alternatively, a neutral venue such as Kathmandu could be </p><p>selected. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>K.

Principal Partners </p><p> </p><p>-- International Water Management Institute </p><p>-- Global Water Partnership </p><p>-- Care International </p><p>-- Disaster relief and water resources affiliated agencies </p><p>of respective governments </p><p>-- International relief agencies such as OFDA, Red Cross </p><p>and others </p><p>-- Multilateral/bilateral donors </p><p>-- USGS </p><p>-- NOAA </p><p>-- Institute for Social and Environmental Transition </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>N.  Roles and resources partners will contribute: </p><p> </p><p>The International Water Management Institute (IWMI) will </p><p>be the lead agency for implementing this project.  IWMI is </p><p>an international non-profit research organization </p><p>specialized in water and land management.  IWMI is part of </p><p>a global coalition of 16 international agricultural </p><p>research centers, collectively known as the Consultative </p><p>Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR), or </p><p>Future Harvest Centers.  IWMI has extensive experience in </p><p>finding and promoting integrated and sustainable solutions </p><p>to water problems, with a bias for river basins as </p><p>appropriate units of water management.  With its head </p><p>offices located in Colombo, Sri Lanka, and regional and </p><p>country offices in over 15 locations in Asia and Africa, </p><p>IWMI has a team of over 150 scientists, making it the </p><p>largest international organization scientific in the </p><p>developing world in the field of water management.  IWMI </p><p>has strong professional presence in Pakistan and India, </p><p>and is part of a new CGIAR initiative for the agricultural </p><p>revival of Afghanistan. </p><p> </p><p>Other partners: </p><p> </p><p>The project will be implemented in collaboration with </p><p>disaster prevention and water management agencies in all </p><p>three countries.  International research, development and </p><p>relief agencies will also cooperate, including the Global </p><p>Water Partnership (GWP) and its regional and country </p><p>chapters in South Asia, the Aga Khan Rural Support Program </p><p>(AKRSP) India and CARE International. </p><p> </p><p>Global Water Partnership (GWP) is a global initiative </p><p>dedicated to promoting best policies and practices in </p><p>integrated water resource management.  With a small </p><p>secretariat in Stockholm, and three resource centers, of </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>which IWMI is one, GWP is a decentralized network of </p><p>independent stakeholders, including national governments, </p><p>research and non-profit organizations, NGOs, UN agencies, </p><p>multilateral banks, private companies, and other </p><p>institutional stakeholders involved in water resource </p><p>management.  The GWP facilitates the exchange of </p><p>knowledge, experience and the practice of integrated water </p><p>resource management.  GWP has active country water </p><p>partnerships in both India and Pakistan. </p><p> </p><p>AKRSP (I) is a community-based rural development </p><p>initiative in Gujarat state with extensive experience in </p><p>developing and promoting cost-effective water management </p><p>techniques and technologies. </p><p> </p><p>CARE International has an on-going agreement with IWMI to </p><p>collaborate on projects designed to serve smallholders in </p><p>water-stressed areas.  The major focus of this partnership </p><p>is on developing and promoting cost-effective technologies </p><p>and management methods, such as water harvesting, storage </p><p>and application.  The two organizations plan to join hands </p><p>in assessing the needs and developing appropriate </p><p>responses to water and agricultural problems in </p><p>Afghanistan. </p><p> </p><p>Multilateral and bilateral donors and investment banks </p><p>will be presented with project proposal for a larger </p><p>initiative required to address chronic drought conditions </p><p>in the region.  We expect that some of these donors will </p><p>be interested in funding elements identified in the </p><p>proposal which address their priorities, such as poverty </p><p>alleviation and environmental management. </p><p> </p><p>In addition, the project will seek to develop close links </p><p>with international, regional and national players in the </p><p>fields of climate and drought monitoring, </p><p>mitigation/relief, and water management.  The project will </p><p>also seek technical cooperation from USG agencies involved </p><p>in drought assessment, including OFDA, USAID, NOAA, and </p><p>USGS.  The project will coordinate closely with ISET\'s </p><p>Adaptive Strategies study (funded through South Asia </p><p>Bureau ESF) to share results and experience, and to avoid </p><p>duplication of effort. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>O.
