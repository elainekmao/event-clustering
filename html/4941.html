After the meeting, Amb. </p><p>Pearson pledged support to all sectors in Turkey if Turkey\'s </p><p>business community backs the U.S. in Iraq.  Pearson drew </p><p>attention to the limited trade volume between the two </p><p>countries, and stressed that he would encourage American </p><p>companies to cooperate with Turkish businesses.  Pearson </p><p>also noted that shoes, leather, and textile products could </p><p>be included in the QIZ proposal.  Ambassador Pearson added </p><p>that Turkey and the U.S. could cooperate in reconstructing </p><p>Iraq, papers report.  Papers claim that TOBB Chairman </p><p>Hisarciklioglu told Pearson that Turkey\'s losses from a war </p><p>against Iraq would be $15-25 billion in the short term, and </p><p>$70 billion over the next decade.  Pearson\'s estimation was </p><p>$4-15 billion, papers say.  Pearson said this figure was </p><p>derived from research in Istanbul, New York, and London </p><p>stock exchanges, and promised reparation for Turkey\'s losses </p><p>in a possible crisis with Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Iraq: Prime Minister Gul will begin his Mideast tour with an </p><p>official visit to Syria January 4, from where he will </p><p>proceed to Jorda, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Iran.  Dailies </p><p>quote diplomatic sources as saying that Gul will voice </p><p>Ankara\'s determination to act together with other countries </p><p>in the region, and will urge joint action to force Iraq to </p><p>abide by UN resolutions.  Gul aims to shatter the impression </p><p>created by the Arab press that Turkey is fueling war </p><p>tensions in order to take control of Mosul and Kirkuk, </p><p>papers note.  Kursad Tuzmen, Turkey\'s State Minister for </p><p>Foreign trade, is due in Baghdad on a trade mission with 200 </p><p>businessmen.  Ankara is striving to normalize its trade </p><p>relations in the region, as Turkey has lost a considerable </p><p>share because of the Gulf crisis and terrorism.  Meanwhile, </p><p>Northern Iraqi Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) leader </p><p>Barzani is expected in Ankara this weekend for meetings with </p><p>MFA, TGS, and Prime Ministry officials.  Ankara-KDP ties and </p><p>the latest Iraqi opposition meeting in London will be </p><p>analyzed during the meetings. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Cyprus: Papers characterize the disagreement between AKP </p><p>leader Erdogan and Turkish Cypriot leader Denktas as </p><p>growing.  "Cumhuriyet" reports that Erdogan\'s criticism of </p><p>Denktas is seen by Greek Cypriots as the end of the Denktas </p><p>era in the Turkish sector.  Denktas defended himself, saying </p><p>he did not regard the Cyprus question as his personal issue, </p><p>but that his views merely reflected the public opinion. </p><p>After meeting with Denktas on Thursday, Turkish Cypriot </p><p>opposition parties told reporters that they did not trust </p><p>Denktas, and urged him to resign.  An opinion poll conducted </p><p>by the Guzelyurt (Morphou) Building Society showed 72 </p><p>percent of Guzelyurt inhabitants are willing to leave their </p><p>residences and soil to Greek Cypriots if a compromise is </p><p>reached via the UN peace plan, reports "Radikal." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Siirt elections: Turkey\'s High Election Board (YSK) </p><p>announced on Thursday that because tough winter conditions </p><p>in Siirt province could reduce voter turnout, the February 9 </p><p>election should be postponed until March or April.  AKP has </p><p>drafted a bill to extend the time period of 60 days for new </p><p>polls to 90 days from the date of the original election. </p><p>Such a change will give the AKP and its leader time to </p><p>consider whether or not Erdogan should take his chances by </p><p>running for the parliament from Siirt. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION:  Iraq </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Last offers from the US" </p><p>Murat Yetkin reveals the financial nature of the US-Turkey </p><p>talks on Iraq in liberal-intellectual Radikal (1/3): "When </p><p>Ambassador Pearson visited the Turkish Chambers of Commerce, </p><p>both the Ambassador and Chairman Hisarciklioglu skillfully </p><p>concealed from the press the real issues they discussed. . </p><p>In fact, the visit was part of the US effort to get Turkey\'s </p><p>views on the Iraq issue, to eliminate the financial concerns </p><p>within the business community, and to provide a message </p><p>prior to PM Gul\'s trip to the Middle East. . </p><p>Ambassador Pearson made the following points during his talk </p><p>with the business leaders: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-  The primary goal of the US is to solve the Iraqi issue </p><p>without a military operation, through political means. For </p><p>this reason, the US is making efforts to ensure that Iraq </p><p>complies fully with UN resolutions. Other options will be </p><p>worked out in case political efforts do not produce results. </p><p>The request for support from Turkey and other countries are </p><p>part of the preparations to cover all possible options. </p><p>- Turkey\'s early commitment to support the US might prevent </p><p>a war in the region. Baghdad could still be deterred if </p><p>Turkey pledges support for the United States. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>- The US is aware that the Turkish economy will be affected </p><p>negatively in the event of a military operation. The US </p><p>wants to protect the Turkish economic reform program in the </p><p>event of a conflict.  In the case of war, Turkey\'s losses, </p><p>based on calculations by international market analysts and </p><p>investors, is estimated at 4-15 billion dollars.  . Building </p><p>confidence in the international markets for Turkey\'s benefit </p><p>- something the United States is already working to achieve </p><p>-- is one of the ways to minimize Turkey\'s losses. </p><p>Secondly, a reserve fund could be established in order to </p><p>minimize Turkey\'s short-run losses. . The amount of Turkish </p><p>support for the US will determine the amounts of US </p><p>financial support to Turkey.  Deciding against cooperation </p><p>with the US would put Turkey in the position of trying to </p><p>deal with the potential looses on its own.  In the case of a </p><p>partial support, the nature of assistance package -civilian, </p><p>military or both-will again play a determining role. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>- The US compensation package contains both credits and </p><p>grants.  The amounts will be discussed between the two </p><p>countries.  Initially, the US offered Turkey a certain </p><p>amount in grants, but the Turkish side expressed a </p><p>preference for low-interest loans. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>US patience for a definitive answer from Turkey is wearing </p><p>thin, and the US has started to reveal elements of its </p><p>bilateral meetings with Ankara via Turkish non-governmental </p><p>organizations. . Washington has started to reveal its cards, </p><p>and Ankara should act accordingly." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
