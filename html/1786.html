REASONS: 1.5 </p><p>(B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>MOYO\'S REMARKS, CONTROVERSIAL AS ALWAYS </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) ON JUNE 25, INFORMATION MINISTER JONATHAN MOYO ANNOUNCED </p><p>THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE WILL SOON PROHIBIT NGOS, CHURCHES, </p><p>AND AID AGENCIES FROM CONDUCTING VOTER EDUCATION CAMPAIGNS. </p><p>ACCORDING TO MOYO, THE GOZ IS DEVISING A POLICY THAT WILL PERMIT </p><p>ONLY THE GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED ELECTORAL SUPERVISORY COMMISSION </p><p>AND POLITICAL PARTIES TO CARRY OUT VOTER EDUCATION EFFORTS. </p><p> </p><p>REACTION </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) NOT SURPRISINGLY, THE NGO COMMUNITY HAS REACTED ANGRILY TO </p><p>MOYO\'S ANNOUNCEMENT.  A GROUP OF 15 CIVIC ORGANIZATIONS ISSUED A </p><p>STATEMENT INSISTING IT WAS THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO INFORM </p><p>VOTERS ABOUT ELECTORAL LAWS AND THEIR RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES. </p><p>IN THEIR STATEMENT, "THE GROUPS REJECT UNRESERVEDLY ANY </p><p>ALLEGATIONS THAT THE VOTER EDUCATION PROVIDED BY CIVIC GROUPS IS </p><p>PARTISAN AND CALL ON THE MINISTER OF INFORMATION AND PUBLICITY TO </p><p>RETRACT THIS UNSUBSTANTIATED AND MALEVOLENT ALLEGATION.  THE </p><p>GROUPS WILL TAKE ALL MEASURES TO DEFEND THEIR LEGAL AND SOCIAL </p><p>RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITY TO INFORM AND EDUCATE THE PUBLIC."  THE </p><p>LEGAL RESOURCES FOUNDATION (LRF) IS AN INFLUENTIAL, WELL-RESPECTED </p><p>NGO WHICH RUNS A NUMBER OF LEGAL AID CLINICS AROUND THE COUNTRY </p><p>AND IS ONE OF THE MANY ORGANIZATIONS ENGAGED IN VOTER EDUCATION </p><p>ACTIVITIES.  IN A STRONGLY-WORDED PRESS RELEASE ON JUNE 27, THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02042  291028Z </p><p>LRF ASSERTED THAT ANY LAW WHICH PURPORTED TO PREVENT CIVIC GROUPS </p><p>FROM CONDUCTING VOTER EDUCATION PROGRAMS WOULD BE OVERTURNED BY </p><p>THE COURTS.  THE LRF EMPHASIZED THAT NGOS AND CHURCHES HAVE LONG </p><p>SPONSORED NON-PARTISAN CIVIC AND VOTER EDUCATION PROGRAMS IN </p><p>ZIMBABWE AND SHOULD CONTINUE TO DO SO.  A JUNE 29 EDITORIAL IN THE </p><p>INDEPENDENT "DAILY NEWS" SLAMMED MOYO\'S ANNOUNCEMENT:  "OF ALL THE </p><p>MANY PARANOID MEASURES THE GOVERNMENT HAS TAKEN IN ITS FUTILE </p><p>ATTEMPT TO STOP THE FIERCE WINDS OF POLITICAL CHANGE THAT HAVE </p><p>BEEN BLOWING ACROSS THE COUNTRY SINCE THE REJECTION OF THE </p><p>FRAUDULENT DRAFT CONSTITUTION IN FEBRUARY LAST YEAR, NONE HAS BEEN </p><p>QUITE SO GLARINGLY UNDEMOCRATIC AND UNCONSTITUTIONAL AS THIS ONE." </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) DURING THE TWENTY-ONE YEARS SINCE INDEPENDENCE, CIVIL </p><p>SOCIETY ORGANIZATIONS HAVE BEEN THE PRINCIPAL IMPLEMENTERS OF </p><p>VOTER EDUCATION.  THEY HAVE FOCUSED ON TECHNICAL/PROCEDURAL ISSUES </p><p>SUCH AS THE IMPORTANCE OF REGISTERING TO VOTE AND VERIFYING THAT </p><p>ONE\'S NAME IS ON THE VOTERS ROLL; THE MECHANICS OF MARKING ONE\'S </p><p>BALLOT AND PLACING IT IN THE BOX; AND EMPHASIS ON THE SECRECY OF </p><p>THE BALLOT.  THESE EFFORTS HAVE BEEN CRUCIAL IN ELEVATING THE </p><p>AWARENESS OF CITIZENS ABOUT THEIR RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES, A </p><p>PREREQUISITE FOR THE CONSOLIDATION OF DEMOCRACY.  IT IS NOT </p><p>SURPRISING, THEREFORE, THAT ZANU-PF INTENDS TO ASSERT ITS CONTROL </p><p>OVER THIS EXERCISE, AS IGNORANCE HAS PROVEN TO BE THE RULING </p><p>PARTY\'S BEST WEAPON IN ITS ATTEMPTS TO CLING TO POWER.  THE </p><p>PROVISION OF VOTER EDUCATION BY NEUTRAL ORGANIZATIONS THREATENS </p><p>ZANU-PF\'S MOST EFFECTIVE CAMPAIGN STRATEGIES, PARTICULARLY IN </p><p>RURAL AREAS: BEATING OPPOSITION SUPPORTERS, THREATENING THEM WITH </p><p>VIOLENCE IF THEY DO NOT VOTE FOR THE RULING PARTY, AND TELLING </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02042  291028Z </p><p>CITIZENS THE PARTY IS ABLE TO DETERMINE FOR WHOM THEY CAST THEIR </p><p>BALLOTS. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) MOYO\'S WILLINGNESS TO ALLOW POLITICAL PARTIES TO CONDUCT </p><p>VOTER EDUCATION CAMPAIGNS UNDERMINES HIS EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT </p><p>CIVIC ORGANIZATIONS HAVE BEEN TOO PARTISAN IN THEIR EFFORTS.  MOYO </p><p>LIKELY ASSUMES, HOWEVER, THAT THE BAN ON FOREIGN FUNDING OF </p><p>POLITICAL PARTIES WILL, IN PRACTICAL TERMS, MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR </p><p>THE OPPOSITION MDC TO FILL THE VOID LEFT BY NGOS.  WE EXPECT THAT </p><p>CIVIL SOCIETY GROUPS WILL FIERCELY RESIST THE GOZ ON THIS ISSUE </p><p>AND IGNORE A BAN IF NECESSARY, BUT A GOVERNMENT PROHIBITION WILL </p><p>MAKE IT EXTREMELY DIFFICULT FOR SUCH GROUPS TO OPERATE, </p><p>PARTICULARLY IN RURAL AREAS.  AS THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION </p><p>EXPECTED IN EARLY 2002 APPROACHES, WE HAVE NO DOUBT THAT ZANU-PF </p><p>WILL COME UP WITH OTHER CREATIVE MEASURES DESIGNED TO MAINTAIN ITS </p><p>HOLD ON POWER. </p><p> </p><p>HOOKS </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
