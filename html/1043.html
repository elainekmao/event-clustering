(C) AMBASSADOR MCDONALD HAD A CORDIAL, BUT SPIRITED, </p><p>1 1/2-HOUR CONVERSATION WITH MINISTER OF LOCAL </p><p>GOVERNMENT AND NATIONAL HOUSING AND ZANU-PF PARTY </p><p>CHAIRMAN, JOHN NKOMO, ON APRIL 7 DURING A FLIGHT BACK </p><p>FROM SOUTH AFRICA.  THE AMBASSADOR EXPRESSED THE USG\'S </p><p>SERIOUS CONCERN OVER THE VIOLENCE THAT OCCURRED ON APRIL </p><p>1 IN HARARE WHEN ZANU-PF SUPPORTERS ATTACKED A "PEACE </p><p>MARCH" ORGANIZED BY THE NATIONAL CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY </p><p>(NCA) (REFTEL).  THE AMBASSADOR STRESSED THAT THE USG </p><p>ALONG WITH THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>COMMUNITY FIND THE GOVERNMENT\'S INACTION IN THE FACE OF, </p><p>AND, INDEED, SUPPORT AND ENCOURAGEMENT OF ATTACKS ON </p><p>PEACEFUL DEMONSTRATORS ABHORRENT.  HE NOTED THAT RIGHT </p><p>THINKING MEMBERS OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY URGED </p><p>THE ZIMBABWEAN GOVERNMENT TO TAKE RESPONSIBLE STEPS TO </p><p>CURB SUCH VIOLENCE IN THE FUTURE.  MINSTER NKOMO </p><p>DEFENDED THE POLICE FAILURE TO PROTECT THE NCA </p><p>PROTESTORS, ARGUING THAT THE ORGANIZATION HAD BEEN </p><p>WARNED OF THE COMPETING DEMONSTRATION BY THE WAR </p><p>VETERANS ON APRIL 1, BUT INSISTED ON HOLDING ITS MARCH </p><p>ANYWAY.  MOREOVER, NKOMO ACCUSED THE NCA OF PROVOKING </p><p>THE WAR VETS THROUGH "LOUD TALK AND SONGS" WHICH </p><p>CRITICIZED THE VETERANS\' OCCUPATION OF WHITE-OWNED </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARMS. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR STATED UNEQUIVOCALLY THAT THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S ABDICATING ITS RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT </p><p>PEACEFUL PROTESTORS WAS UNACCEPTABLE.  AMBASSADOR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01969  01 OF 02  111521Z </p><p>MCDONALD STRESSED THAT WE ARE LOOKING TO THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>OF ZIMBABWE TO RESPECT THE OPPOSITION\'S RIGHT TO FREEDOM </p><p>OF SPEECH AND ASSEMBLY, AND SPECIFICALLY URGED THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT TO TAKE STEPS TO ENSURE THAT NO HARM COMES TO </p><p>MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC) PRESIDENT, MORGAN </p><p>TSVANGIRAI.  NKOMO RESPONDED THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAD NO </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>INTENTION OF HARMING TSVANGIRAI, BUT WARNED, WITHOUT </p><p>ELABORATING, THAT THE MDC PRESIDENT NEEDED TO "BE </p><p>CAREFUL." </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR THEN TOLD MINISTER NKOMO THAT </p><p>WASHINGTON WAS ALSO DISTURBED ABOUT THE COMMERCIAL FARM </p><p>INVASIONS AND THE GOVERNMENT\'S HAND IN FACILITATING THE </p><p>OCCUPATIONS BY THE WAR VETERANS AND THEIR SUPPORTERS. </p><p>NKOMO DID NOT DENY THAT THE GOVERNMENT, THROUGH ZANU-PF </p><p>OFFICIALS, WAS SUPPORTING THE OCCUPATIONS.  "WHAT WAS </p><p>THE POINT OF OUR FIGHTING A WAR OF LIBERATION IF WE </p><p>CANNOT CONTROL OUR LAND," NKOMO ASKED RHETORICALLY.  THE </p><p>MINISTER THEN BLAMED THE LACK OF FUNDS WITH WHICH TO </p><p>PURCHASE FARMS AND THE WHITE COMMERCIAL FARMERS\' LEGAL </p><p>CHALLENGES TO THE GOVERNMENT\'S LAND REFORM PROGRAM AS </p><p>THE CAUSE OF THE CURRENT OCCUPATIONS.  THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>RESPONDED THAT THE USG WOULD NOT TOLERATE THE VIOLATION </p><p>OF THE RULE OF LAW WITH RESPECT TO THE TAKING OF FARM </p><p>LAND WITHOUT COMPENSATION AND SAW THE OCCUPATIONS AS </p><p>PART OF THE GOVERNMENT\'S POLITICAL AGENDA, TO WHICH </p><p>MINISTER NKOMO DID NOT REPLY.  AMBASSADOR MCDONALD ALSO </p><p>UNDERSCORED USG SUPPORT FOR LAND REFORM AS AGREED TO AT </p><p>THE DONOR\'S CONFERENCE IN SEPTEMBER 1998. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) THE CONVERSATION THEN TURNED TO GENERAL </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  01969  01 OF 02  111521Z </p><p>POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS WITHIN THE RULING PARTY AND </p><p>PRESIDENT MUGABE\'S FUTURE PLANS.  NKOMO TOLD THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR THAT HE WAS FINDING THE POSITION OF ZANU-PF </p><p>PARTY CHAIRMAN A VERY DIFFICULT ONE AND THEN CRITICIZED </p><p>THE COMMERCIAL FARMERS UNION (CFU) FOR ITS SUPPORT OF </p><p>THE MDC.  NKOMO ASSERTED THAT THE CFU AS A GROUP HAD NO </p><p>RIGHT TO SUPPORT A POLITICAL PARTY, ALTHOUGH HE CONCEDED </p><p>ITS INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS COULD DO SO.  THE ZANU-PF PARTY </p><p>CHAIRMAN THEN STATED THAT IT WAS NO LONGER CLEAR WHETHER </p><p>PRESIDENT MUGABE WOULD STEP DOWN AT THE END OF HIS TERM </p><p>IN 2002.  PRIOR TO THE FEBRUARY DEFEAT OF THE </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL REFERENDUM, THE PLAN WAS FOR MUGABE TO </p><p>PAVE THE WAY FOR A SUCCESSOR AND THEN MAKE A GRACEFUL </p><p>EXIT BY THE YEAR 2002.  WITH THE DEFEAT OF THE DRAFT </p><p>CONSTITUTION, AND ITS PROVISIONS FOR A PRIME MINISTER </p><p>AND PRESIDENT OF A SENATE, "ALL BETS ARE OFF" AS TO WHAT </p><p>MUGABE WILL DO, ACCORDING TO NKOMO.  NKOMO STATED: "THE </p><p>NEW CONSTITUTION PROVIDED MUGABE WITH COVER TO ANNOUNCE </p><p>HIS PLANNED RETIREMENT."  MOREOVER, NO ONE IN THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT WILL EVEN RAISE THE ISSUE OF THE PRESIDENT\'S </p><p>FUTURE PLANS WITH HIM, NKOMO SAID. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) COMMENT: MINISTER NKOMO, LIKE MANY OTHER SENIOR </p><p>GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, HAS CHOSEN NOT TO SEEK REELECTION </p><p>IN THE UPCOMING PARLIAMENTARY RACE.

NKOMO, LIKE MANY OTHERS IN THE </p><p>RULING PARTY, ARE ANGRY AND FRUSTRATED THAT ZANU-PF IS </p><p>FACED WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF LOSING TO THE MDC -- A </p><p>PARTY THEY SEE CONSISTING OF POLITICAL UPSTARTS WITH </p><p>WHITE FINANCIAL BACKING.  THESE ZANU-PF OFFICIALS ARE </p><p>LASHING OUT AT OPPOSITION, WHITE FARMERS, AND ANY ONE </p><p>WHO SUPPORTS THOSE GROUPS IN THE RUN-UP TO THE ELECTION. </p><p>IN THIS REGARD, WE NOTE THAT AT AN APRIL 10 MEETING OF </p><p>WESTERN DONOR COUNTRY POLITICAL OFFICERS AND DEVELOPMENT </p><p>ASSISTANCE OFFICERS IN HARARE, THERE WAS NO INDICATION </p><p>THAT ANY OF THE RESIDENT MISSIONS INTENDS TO DELIVER </p><p>TOUGH BILATERAL MESSAGES IN SUPPORT OF RESTRAINT AND </p><p>NON-VIOLENCE TO THE GOVERNMENT.  NEVERTHELESS, THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR WILL CONTINUE TO ENGAGE OUR CIVIL SOCIETY </p><p>ORGANIZATION, OPPOSITION AND GOVERNMENT INTERLOCUTORS TO </p><p>PRESS FOR A PEACEFUL PRE- AND POST-ELECTION CAMPAIGN </p><p>SEASON. </p><p> </p><p>MCDONALD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
