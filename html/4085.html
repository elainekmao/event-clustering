<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 002933 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/25/12 </p><p>TAGS: PBTS, MOPS, PGOV, PREL, PREF, EPET, NI, CM </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: MOD DANJUMA DENIES PARIS AGREEMENT ON </p><p>BAKASSI </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter; reasons 1.5 (B) </p><p>and (D) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY: During an October 25 meeting with </p><p>Ambassador Jeter, Nigerian Minister of Defense Lieutenant </p><p>General (ret.) Theophilus Y. Danjuma discussed the GON\'s </p><p>position on the ICJ\'s Bakassi decision.  While Danjuma </p><p>denied the GON had agreed to abide by the ICJ\'s ruling at </p><p>the September 5 Paris meeting, he said Nigeria had no plans </p><p>to take offensive action and was hopeful that a negotiated </p><p>political settlement could be reached with Cameroon.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) During an October 25 conversation with Nigerian </p><p>Minister of Defense Danjuma, Ambassador Jeter asked about </p><p>the GON\'s "rejection" of the ICJ\'s ruling on the Bakassi. </p><p>Ambassador said that we were somewhat taken aback by the </p><p>declaration since the Nigerian and Cameroonian Heads of </p><p>State had agreed at the September 5 bilateral meeting in </p><p>Paris to abide by the ICJ judgement.  Stating emphatically </p><p>that he was present throughout the Presidential meeting, </p><p>Danjuma denied President Obasanjo had promised to honor the </p><p>ICJ\'s decision during the Paris talks with President Biya. </p><p>Danjuma said the GON had authorized the UNSG to make a </p><p>statement on the talks, but was unaware of the statement\'s </p><p>content before it was released.  Danjuma went on to explain </p><p>that it would not have made sense for Nigeria to agree to </p><p>abide by a ruling from which there was no appeal without </p><p>having a clear idea of what that ruling would be.  COMMENT: </p><p>The GON line that Obasanjo never promised to abide by the </p><p>ICJ ruling seems to be disingenuous if not duplicitous. </p><p>That the GON did not seek to correct the UN\'s apparent </p><p>misunderstanding of such an important issue is unexpected, </p><p>to say the least.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) When asked about Nigeria\'s plans, Danjuma said </p><p>since the GON did not recognize the ICJ\'s ruling, Nigeria </p><p>would not remove its soldiers, police or administrators </p><p>from the Bakassi.  Danjuma said the GON had no offensive </p><p>designs against Cameroon, but would use force if its troops </p><p>in the Bakassi were attacked.  COMMENT: Although Danjuma </p><p>may be correct in saying the GON is not planning to mount </p><p>an offensive against Cameroon, there are signs of a </p><p>military build-up which could mean that the Nigerians have </p><p>not taken this unfortunate option completely off the table. </p><p>END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Explaining U.S. policy on the Bakassi, Ambassador </p><p>urged Danjuma to find a political solution to the problem </p><p>and to avoid, at all costs, any resort to the use of force. </p><p>There were any number of modalities that could be conceived </p><p>so that there are no real losers on Bakassi, including </p><p>joint administration and resource sharing.  Danjuma said </p><p>that Abuja had always advocated a political settlement, but </p><p>Yaounde had been recalcitrant and insisted that the issue </p><p>be taken to the ICJ.  Nevertheless, and in spite of the ICJ </p><p>ruling, Nigeria remained hopeful that a political </p><p>settlement could still be reached. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
