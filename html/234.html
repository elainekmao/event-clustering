<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 CAIRO 21161 </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR MILLIKEN, CENTCOM FOR POLAD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PINS, SOCI, EG </p><p>SUBJECT:  MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD - "JIHAD" FRICTIONS </p><p> </p><p>REF: (NOTAL) CAIRO  20169 </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  TENSIONS SIMMERING BETWEEN THE MUSLIM </p><p>BROTHERHOOD (MB) AND A MORE EXTREME GROUP  ERUPTED INTO </p><p>A BLOODY CLASH IN ASSYUT IN LATE JULY.  (THE EXTREMISTS </p><p>WERE IDENTIFIED BOTH AS "AL-JIHAD" AND AS "AL-GAMA\'A </p><p>AL-ISLAMIYA", OR THE ISLAMIC GROUPING, SINGULAR.)  THE </p><p>INTRA-ISLAMIC VIOLENCE IN ASSYUT PROVOKED SHAME AMONG </p><p>SOME ISLAMIC POLITICAL ACTIVISTS AND REVULSION AMONG </p><p>THE PUBLIC AT LARGE.  THE CLASH APPEARED TO BE MOSTLY A </p><p>CASE OF YOUTHFUL THUGGERY, MIXED WITH A FUNDAMENTAL </p><p>DOCTRINAL DIFFERENCE OVER THE ACCEPTABILITY OF WORKING </p><p>WITHIN A NON-ISLAMIC SYSTEM TO BRING ABOUT ISLAMIC </p><p>GOALS.  THOUGH THE MB SUPREME GUIDE AND ONE LEADER OF </p><p>THE EXTREMISTS PERSONALLY CAME TO A PEACEFUL </p><p>UNDERSTANDING, THEY MANAGED BARELY TO PAPER OVER THE </p><p>CONTINUING FRICTIONS, BASED ON MUTUALLY HOSTILE </p><p>PERCEPTIONS:  THE MB REGARD THE "JIHADISTS" AS ERRANT </p><p>AND IGNORANT YOUTH AT BEST, WHILE THE LATTER CHARGE THE </p><p>MB WITH COWARDICE AND "FORBIDDEN" COLLABORATION WITH </p><p>THE SECULAR STATE.  MEANWHILE, THE INCIDENT HAS EXPOSED </p><p>AN APPARENT RIVALRY BETWEEN THE MB AND THE JIHAD FOR </p><p>LEADERSHIP OF "AL-GAMA\'A AL ISLAMIYA".  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>3.  ACCORDING TO UNUSUALLY WELL-DONE PRESS ACCOUNTS </p><p>(SEE LAST PARA), THE MB AND THE EXTREMIST "JIHAD" GROUP </p><p>(OFTEN IDENTIFIED BY THE PRESS AS "AL-GAMA\'A </p><p>AL-ISLAMIYA", OF WHICH AL-JIHAD, HOWEVER, PROBABLY IS </p><p>JUST ONE CONSTITUENT PART) HAD BEEN CIRCULATING </p><p>LEAFLETS AGAINST EACH OTHER OVER SOME NINE MONTHS IN </p><p>THE UPPER EGYPTIAN PROVINCIAL CAPITAL OF ASSYUT. </p><p>HANDBILLS SIGNED "AL-GAMA\'A AL-ISLAMIYA" CHARGED THE MB </p><p>ARE COWARDS, WHO USED TO ATTACK MINOR OFFICIALS, AND </p><p>THEN DENIED THEIR RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ATTACKS (IN </p><p>CONTRAST TO THE JIHAD, WHICH STOOD UP FOR ITS </p><p>ASSASSINATION OF SADAT).  THEY CHARGED THAT THE MB </p><p>"HATE TO SEE \'ISLAM\' EMERGE, EXCEPT FROM THEIR </p><p>THROATS."  IT CALLED THEM "TRAINED CIRCUS LIONS" FOR </p><p>ENTERING THE PEOPLE\'S ASSEMBLY, THEREBY COLLABORATING </p><p>WITH A GOVERNMENT SEEN AS ISLAMICALLY ILLEGITIMATE.  IN </p><p>TURN, THE MB\'S LEAFLETS INSULTINGLY DISMISSED </p><p>AL-JIHAD", AND ITS PRETENSIONS TO LEADERSHIP OF </p><p>AL-GAMA\'A AL-ISLAMIYA,  AS "LITTLE ONES. . . WHO HAS </p><p>LED THEM ASTRAY?" </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>4.  AT LAST MAY\'S FEAST OF \'EID AL-FITR, THE </p><p>PAMPHLETEERING RACHETED UP TO A "WAR OF THE POSTERS", </p><p>AS EACH SIDE PLASTERED OVER ITS RIVAL\'S ANNOUNCEMENTS </p><p>OF UPCOMING HOLIDAY PRAYER MEETINGS.  THE POSTER WAR </p><p>WAS RENEWED A FEW DAYS BEFORE THE LARGER FEAST OF THE </p><p>SACRIFICE (JULY 24-25).  AROUND THE SAME TIME, GANGS OF </p><p>MB AND JIHADISTS REPORTEDLY USED MACHO INTIMIDATION </p><p>TECHNIQUES REMINISCENT OF WEST SIDE STORY, INCLUDING </p><p>MOTORCYCLE-MOUNTED MB YOUTHS AND SWITCHBLADE-WIELDING </p><p>JIHADISTS.  AN MB LEADER TOLD JOURNALISTS THAT THE </p><p>JIHADISTS PROVOKED THE CULMINATING RUMBLE OF JULY 23 BY </p><p>CLAIMING "OUR (JIHADIST) WOMEN HAVE MORE VIRILITY THAN </p><p>THEIR (MB) MEN."  IN UPPER EGYPT, THOSE ARE FIGHTING </p><p>WORDS THAT CANNOT BE IGNORED. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>5.  ACCORDING TO THE INVESTIGATIVE PRESS REPORTS, </p><p>VIOLENCE FINALLY BROKE OUT ON THE EVE OF THE FEAST OF </p><p>THE SACRIFICE, AS MB YOUTHS WERE PREPARING SWEETS FOR </p><p>CHILDRENS\' HOLIDAY GIFTS IN THEIR MOSQUE OF SHALNAB. </p><p>MORE THAN 150 YOUTHS OF THE GAMA\'A SEALED OFF THE </p><p>STREET, AND SHOUTED TO BYSTANDERS THAT "POLICE" INSIDE </p><p>THE MOSQUE WERE PREVENTING PEOPLE FROM ENTERING TO </p><p>PRAY.  THEN THEY INVADED THE MOSQUE, AND OVER THE </p><p>COURSE OF ABOUT 30 MINUTES DESTROYED ITS FURNITURE AND </p><p>WINDOWS, KNIFING THE YOUTHS INSIDE AND BEATING THEM </p><p>WITH CHAINS.  13 MB AND BYSTANDERS WERE INJURED.  THE </p><p>ATTACKERS FLED BEFORE POLICE ARRIVED BUT SEVEN WERE </p><p>LATER ARRESTED, ACCORDING TO POLICE RECORDS REPORTED BY </p><p>THE PRESS.  ONE NEUTRAL BYSTANDER TOLD JOURNALISTS THAT </p><p>HE HAD NEVER SEEN SUCH VIOLENCE IN HIS LIFE -- "EVEN </p><p>THE JEWS AND NASSERISTS COULD NOT DO ANYTHING LIKE </p><p>THIS|"  THE LOCAL POLICE PASSED UP THE OPPORTUNITY TO </p><p>GLOAT, TELLING REPORTERS ONLY THAT "IT IS NOT IN THE </p><p>INTERESTS OF (PUBLIC) SECURITY THAT THERE BE CONFLICT </p><p>BETWEEN THE MB AND THE JIHAD." </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>6.  ACCORDING TO PRESS REPORTS, IN THE IMMEDIATE </p><p>AFTERMATH OF THE CLASH THE MB LEADERSHIP REJECTED </p><p>RECONCILIATION INITIATIVES BY "AL-GAMA\'IYA </p><p>AL-SHAR\'IYA", WIDELY-KNOWN AS AN OFFICIALLY-REGISTERED </p><p>AND ESTABLISHMENTARIAN GROUPING OF SOME 2,000 MOSQUES </p><p>ENGAGED IN SOCIAL SERVICES.  THE FOLLOWING WEEK, </p><p>HOWEVER, DR. \'OMAR \'ABDURRAHMAN, IDENTIFIED IN THE </p><p>SYMPATHETIC RELIGIOUS OPPOSITION PRESS AS "AMIR </p><p>(PRINCE) OF AL-GAMA\'A AL-ISLAMIYA," SPOKE FROM SAUDI </p><p>ARABIA BY PHONE WITH MB SUPREME GUIDE ABUL NASR. </p><p>ACCORDING TO THE "SPOKESMAN" OF THE GAMA\'A,  DR. \'ALA\' </p><p>MOHI AL-DIN, \'ABDURRAHMAN ORDERED THE GROUP TO SHOW </p><p>"SELF DISCIPLINE".  OTHER LEADING RADICAL RELIGIOUS </p><p>FIGURES, INCLUDING ALEXANDRIA\'S AHMED AL-MEHALLAWI, </p><p>ALSO INTERVENED.  THE STAGE WAS THUS SET FOR THE </p><p>OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENT OF RECONCILIATION AT THE MOSQUE </p><p>OF AL-GAMA\'IYA AL-SHAR\'IYA IN ASSYUT AUGUST 5. </p><p>(DESPITE ITS REPORTED ROLE IN THE MB-JIHAD </p><p>RECONCILIATION, HOWEVER, THE NATIONAL LEADER OF </p><p>AL-GAMA\'IYA AL-SHAR\'IYA, TOLD US THAT HIS GROUP HAS NO </p><p>CONNECTION, PERSONAL OR OFFICIAL, WITH EITHER THE MB OR </p><p>THE GAMA\'A.) </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>7.  SINCE THEN, WESTERN JOURNALISTS WHO INTERVIEWED </p><p>JIHAD/GAMA\'A MEMBERS INVOLVED IN THE AIN SHAMS INCIDENT </p><p>IN CAIRO OF AUGUST 12-13, TOLD US THAT THE TENSIONS </p><p>BETWEEN THE MB AND RADICALS CLEARLY REMAIN.  THE HEART </p><p>OF THE ISSUE SEEMS TO BE THE MB\'S RESENTMENT OF THE </p><p>JIHAD\'S ASSERTION OF A LEADERSHIP ROLE WITHIN WHAT </p><p>APPEARS TO BE A KIND OF UMBRELLA GROUPING OF AL-GAMA\'A </p><p>AL-ISLAMIYA.  THE JOURNALISTS TOLD US THE YOUTHS </p><p>EVIDENTLY SOUGHT DELIBERATELY TO OBSCURE THEIR GROUP\'S </p><p>IDENTITY OR RELATIONSHIP WITH THAT OF THE AL-GAMA\'A </p><p>AL-ISLAMIYA.  ALSO, THOUGH THE MB\'S \'ESAM AL-\'ARIAN </p><p>CONFIRMED TO EMBOFF THAT THE MB AND JIHAD WERE </p><p>RECONCILED", HE BROKE THE ISLAMICISTS\' NORMALLY </p><p>MAFIA-LIKE CODE OF SILENCE TO PROVIDE SOME DETAILS </p><p>ABOUT THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE ISLAMIC GROUPS. </p><p>(SEPARATE REPORT WILL FOLLOW AS WE SORT OUT CONFLICTING </p><p>DETAILS.)  AL-\'ARIAN WENT OUT OF HIS WAY TO EMPHASIZE </p><p>THAT THE JIHAD\'S CLAIM TO LEADERSHIP OF AL-GAMA\'A IS </p><p>BOGUS.  HE BLAMED POLICE OPPRESSION OF THE JIHAD FOR </p><p>TURNING THEM INTO POPULAR HEROES, WHILE THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>FAILS TO DISTINGUISH THE MB FROM THE VIOLENT GROUPS. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>8.  COMMENT:  THE BLOODY ASSYUT CLASH CLEARLY HAS </p><p>EMBARRASSED SOME OF OUR CONTACTS AMONG ISLAMIC </p><p>POLITICAL ACTIVISTS BECAUSE OF ITS UGLY AND </p><p>"UN-ISLAMIC" VIOLENCE.  MORE IMPORTANTLY, WE SENSE </p><p>UNHAPPINESS IN ISLAMIC POLITICAL QUARTERS OVER THE </p><p>INCIDENT\'S EXPOSURE OF BITTER DIVISIONS IN ISLAMIC </p><p>POLITICAL RANKS -- AND HENCE, SOME CLUES TO ITS SHADOWY </p><p>ORGANIZATION.  IN FACT, AL-NUR, THE SYMPATHETIC </p><p>RELIGIOUS OPPOSITION PAPER THAT MOST FULLY OUTLINED THE </p><p>STORY, REPORTED THAT HENCEFORTH IT WILL COMPLY WITH THE </p><p>WRITTEN REQUESTS OF BOTH PARTIES TO AVOID PUBLISHING </p><p>FURTHER ON THE ASSYUT INCIDENT. </p><p> </p><p>9.  MEANWHILE, THERE IS NO INDICATION YET THAT THE </p><p>FORMAL MB-JIHAD RECONCILIATION HAS TAKEN DEEP ROOT, OR </p><p>THAT THEIR RIVALRY WILL DEVELOP SOON INTO COOPERATION. </p><p>WITH THE JIHAD LEADERSHIP AND MANY OF ITS "FEW" CADRES </p><p>IN PRISON, ACCORDING TO SEVERAL SOURCES, THE MB WOULD </p><p>SEEM TO HAVE THE UPPER HAND.  WHAT REMAINS UNCLEAR IS </p><p>THE EXACT ORGANIZATIONAL NATURE OF THE "GAMA\'A </p><p>AL-ISLAMIYA", AND THE ROLE OF THE MB AND OTHER GROUPS </p><p>WITHIN IT.  THE ASSYUT INCIDENT, HOWEVER, HAS SHED SOME </p><p>LIGHT ON THE SHADOWY RELATIONSHIPS OF THESE GROUPS, AND </p><p>OVER THE COMING MONTHS WE WILL BE TRYING TO EXPLOIT </p><p>SOME NEW LEADS TO TRY TO MAKE SENSE OF THESE TIES. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>10.  FOR MORE DETAILED REPORTS OF THE ASSYUT INCIDENT, </p><p>WE CALL ANALYSTS\' ATTENTION TO CENTER-LEFTIST, </p><p>SECULARIST ESTABLISHMENT WEEKLY "ROSE EL-YUSUF" OF </p><p>AUGUST 22 AND MODERATE ISLAMIC OPPOSITION WEEKLY </p><p>"AL-NUR" OF AUGUST 3 AND AUGUST 10.  AL-NUR </p><p>INVESTIGATIVE ARTICLES ARE STARTLINGLY UNUSUAL AS </p><p>EGYPTIAN JOURNALISM, STRIVING FOR OBJECTIVITY BY NAMING </p><p>SOURCES AND DESCRIBING THE INCIDENT FROM THE DIFFERING </p><p>VIEWPOINTS OF THE MB, JIHAD, POLICE, AND INNOCENT </p><p>BYSTANDERS.  ARTICLES PROVIDE MB AND JIHAD/GAMA\'A LOGOS </p><p>FROM THEIR PAMPHLETS, AND PUBLISH PHOTOS AND NAMES OF </p><p>INDIVIDUALS AND MOSQUES ASSOCIATED WITH THE VARIOUS </p><p>ISLAMIC GROUPS IN ASSYUT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>WISNER </p><p></p></div>
