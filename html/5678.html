<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 GUATEMALA 000379 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR WHA/CEN AND WHA/PPC </p><p>USTR FOR JON ROSENBAUM AND BUD CLATANOFF </p><p>USDOL FOR ILAB: JORGE PEREZ-LOPEZ </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ELAB, ETRD, PHUM, GT </p><p>SUBJECT: GSP WORKER RIGHTS: EMBASSY SUPPORTS CONSULTATIONS </p><p>OVER REVIEW </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 35553 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary:  Embassy believes that bilateral </p><p>consultations would be as productive as a formal GSP review </p><p>of Guatemalan worker rights.  Although the labor rights </p><p>situation is bad, it is not worsening and the GOG has in fact </p><p>taken steps to protect labor rights since the last review was </p><p>suspended.  Furthermore, the political effects of a formal </p><p>review are uncertain.  The GOG is in an election year and is </p><p>reeling from recent USG narcotics de-certification.  Adding </p><p>the threat of withdrawal of GSP benefits could provoke a </p><p>backlash against USG "blacklisting."  We suggest the </p><p>Department support an alternative strategy of bilateral </p><p>consultations to promote labor rights improvements.  We have </p><p>already begun this process by signaling key GOG interlocutors </p><p>privately, and have built it into our Mission Program Plan. </p><p>We welcome USTR participation in these consultations in the </p><p>broader context of CAFTA negotiations.  If decision is made </p><p>to conduct a formal review, however, we will of course work </p><p>to make it a sucesss.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>The GOG has "Taken Steps" </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) The AFL-CIO and International Labor Rights Fund </p><p>petitions on Guatemala correctly identify major weaknesses in </p><p>the protection of labor rights in Guatemala.  Labor rights </p><p>violations continue to be common and serious here, and must </p><p>change for Guatemala to be a full partner under CAFTA.  Most </p><p>worrisome to us is the situation of impunity for those who </p><p>attack labor leaders, the ineffective labor justice system, </p><p>and particularly egregious cases of non-reinstatement of </p><p>illegally fired workers.  The petitions do not, however, take </p><p>into account positive steps to protect worker rights taken by </p><p>the GOG since the last USTR review ended in May 2001.  These </p><p>include: </p><p> </p><p>-- creation of a Special Prosecutor\'s Office to Investigate </p><p>Attacks on Union Members in 2001; </p><p> </p><p>-- creation of a consensual National Plan for Occupational </p><p>Health and Safety in 2002; </p><p> </p><p>-- cooperation with the ILO\'s International Program to </p><p>Eliminate Child Labor in several sectors of the economy; </p><p> </p><p>-- revitalization of the Labor Ministry under ex-minister </p><p>Godoy; </p><p> </p><p>-- increased inspections, with the result that the first year </p><p>of implementation of the Ministry\'s newly authorized fines </p><p>totals more than the labor courts have imposed in 50 years; </p><p> </p><p>-- resolution of the high-profile DYMEL dispute. </p><p> </p><p>Movement on Issues Mentioned in Petitions </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) In addition, several problems in the petitions have </p><p>been resolved or require clarification.  For example: </p><p> </p><p>In the AFL-CIO petition; </p><p> </p><p>-- The Jalapa Coca Cola\'s local bottler recently agreed to a </p><p>collective bargaining agreement with its union; </p><p> </p><p>-- Jalapa municipal workers struck in 2002, but returned to </p><p>work after concessions from the mayor; </p><p> </p><p>-- Labor relations at the Choi Shin-Cimatextiles maquila have </p><p>normalized since management instituted regular meetings with </p><p>its unions, which have failed to organize 25% of the workers; </p><p> </p><p>-- With GOG support, ILO/IPEC has launched a new project to </p><p>combat child labor in the Guatemala City municipal dump; </p><p> </p><p>In the ILRF petition; </p><p> </p><p>-- The petition incorrectly asserts that the Labor Ministry </p><p>has failed to use its new power to levy fines; </p><p> </p><p>-- The SITRABI case in Morales, Izabal is resolved.  Further </p><p>attacks have occurred in the area over illegal land </p><p>occupations, not labor rights; </p><p> </p><p>-- The existence of "solidarity associations" does not </p><p>violate the right to association; </p><p> </p><p>-- Public sector doctors, health workers and banana workers </p><p>held unofficial work stoppages in 2002, without GOG </p><p>intervention; and </p><p> </p><p>-- discrimination is not grounds for GSP review. </p><p> </p><p>An Alternative Path To Achieve Review Goals </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) We believe that aggressive bilateral consultations </p><p>with the Labor Minister, Foreign Minister, Attorney General </p><p>and Judicial Branch could achieve the same ends as a USTR </p><p>review.  These consultations, which we have already </p><p>initiated, will focus on achieving progress in labor justice, </p><p>investigation of unresolved crimes against union leaders, and </p><p>reinstallation of illegally fired workers.  New </p><p>opportunities, including the new Labor Minister Victor </p><p>Moreira\'s legislative priorities (e.g. to combat gender </p><p>discrimination) could also be incorporated in our </p><p>consultation efforts.  As an Embassy, we are committed to </p><p>make this strategy work and will highlight it strategy in our </p><p>Mission Program Plan, which is about to be submitted. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) In sum, we think we can best advance labor rights </p><p>through bilateral consultations.  If, however, Washington </p><p>agencies conclude otherwise, count on our full support. </p><p>Hamilton </p><p></p></div>
