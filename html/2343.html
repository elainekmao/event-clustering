<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 003273 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/27/2011 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINS, OIIP, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIAN JUSTICE MINISTER ASSASSINATED </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 220109 </p><p>     B. ABUJA 2878 </p><p>     C. ABUJA 3228 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by CDA Andrews; Reasons 1.5 (b/d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) 71-year-old Nigerian Minister of Justice and Attorney </p><p>General Bola Ige was assassinated in his Ibadan (Oyo State) </p><p>home on 23 December around 2100.  According to press reports, </p><p>Ige had just released his security detail so they could get </p><p>something to eat.  Four or five individuals entered the home, </p><p>took control of Ige\'s family, and then shot Ige, who was </p><p>alone in his bedroom.  Some newspapers report that the single </p><p>gunshot wound to the chest featured a "disintegrating bullet" </p><p>(perhaps a reference to a hollow-point round).  The assassins </p><p>then departed.  Nothing was reported stolen, and no one else </p><p>was injured.  Ige reportedly died en route to the hospital. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) The attack followed other violence surrounding </p><p>political infighting in Osun State between Governor Adebisi </p><p>Akande (an Ige protege) and Deputy Governor Iyiola Omisore. </p><p>Ige was highly influential across the Southwest as one of the </p><p>two last surviving governors elected in 1979 from the ranks </p><p>of Obafemi Awolowo\'s UPN.  The other, Lateef Jakande, </p><p>compromised himself during the Abacha years and on longer </p><p>enjoyed the same stature as Ige.  Moreover, Ige played an </p><p>important role both in the Southwest-centered Alliance for </p><p>Democracy (AD) party and Afenifere, the Yoruba </p><p>politico-cultural group.  With the AD officially in the </p><p>Opposition but Ige serving as a Minister, the late Attorney </p><p>General was an important voice in Abuja for Southwestern </p><p>interests.  The conflict between Akande and Omisore had ten </p><p>days before notched up in intensity when an unruly crowd </p><p>linked in the media to Omisore jostled Ige at Ile-Ife, the </p><p>spiritual center of Yoruba traditional beliefs.  A few days </p><p>later, Osun State Lawmaker Odunayo Olagbaju, an Omisore </p><p>partisan, was killed in the same town, after which a </p><p>dusk-to-dawn curfew was declared in Ile-Ife.  Two other </p><p>lawmakers are reportedly wanted for questioning in respect of </p><p>Olagbaju\'s death. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) In response to Ige\'s death, President Obasanjo </p><p>cancelled his 24 December trip to Harare, and called a </p><p>meeting on the security situation in Osun.  Attendees </p><p>included the Vice President, the Deputy Senate President, the </p><p>Minister of State for Justice, the Inspector General of </p><p>Police, and others.  After the meeting concluded, military </p><p>forces were deployed to portions of Oyo and Osun (in what is </p><p>reportedly a police-led action to contain tensions). </p><p>Meanwhile, the Osun government declared a dusk-to-dawn curfew </p><p>throughout the state. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) COMMENT: Ige\'s death appears to be the latest in a </p><p>cycle of violence born of Alliance for Democracy (AD) party </p><p>in-fighting, particularly between the Governor and Deputy </p><p>Governor of Osun.  Some media are suggesting the AG was </p><p>killed to avenge Olagbuju\'s death.  The Chief of Staff to </p><p>Lagos Governor Tinubu in a conversation with Consul General </p><p>sought to link the ruling People\'s Democratic Party (PDP) to </p><p>the killing, saying that the PDP wanted to wrest control of </p><p>Oyo from the AD but could not do that as long as Ige was on </p><p>the scene.  Others try to implicate the North, arguing that </p><p>Ige\'s recent public statements in opposition to the sentence </p><p>of death by stoning pronounced on Safiya Husseini had made </p><p>the late AG a target for Sharia proponents.  The politics of </p><p>Nigeria are dense, but these latter two views strike us as </p><p>less probable than a connection to the bloody battle between </p><p>Akande and Omisore. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) COMMENT CONTINUED: The murder of Ige, however, marks a </p><p>new low in a political cycle increasingly governed by </p><p>jockeying for position in anticipation of the 2003 elections. </p><p> Along with the PDP convention that almost fell apart before </p><p>it happened (Abuja 2878) and the electoral law that was not </p><p>handled properly (Abuja 3228) and is provoking an ever-larger </p><p>chorus of protest (septel), the senseless killing of </p><p>Nigeria\'s 71 year-old Minister of Justice shows the </p><p>regrettable willingness of Nigerian political actors to walk </p><p>the cliff\'s edge.  With so much patronage linked to the </p><p>outcome of elections, many exhibit an unfortunate tendency to </p><p>test the exact limits of the brink, counting on their </p><p>adversaries to have less nerve and pull back first. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) COMMENT CONTINUED:  One would like to think that the </p><p>killing of "Uncle Bola" Ige would provide impetus to pull </p><p>back from the cliff\'s edge, not a temptation to test it </p><p>further:  Although Ige is the first Federal Minister killed </p><p>for apparent political reasons, many other Nigerians have </p><p>died this year in conflict of an essentially political </p><p>nature.  With the 2003 elections more than a year away and </p><p>many hurdles to cross before they can successfully be held, </p><p>the probability for further political violence is high. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) COMMENT CONTINUED:  It is critical for President </p><p>Obasanjo and civil authority to assert themselves.  While </p><p>dispatching the military to yet another area of tension and </p><p>unrest may put a lid on violence for now, such action does </p><p>not offer much hope for the medium-term stability required to </p><p>restore the public sense of trust in its government\'s ability </p><p>to ensure their security.  Rumors of an impending cabinet </p><p>reshuffle had recently been heard in Abuja.  If there is </p><p>truth to these rumors, Ige\'s death will probably move the </p><p>date of the cabinet reshuffle closer.  A change would likely </p><p>offer some initial encouragement to the body politic, but </p><p>real results will be required to sustain it.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) The Embassy released the following statement on </p><p>December 27: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Begin text: </p><p>Statement by the American Embassy </p><p>On the Death of Minister of Justice and </p><p>Attorney General Chief Bola Ige </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It was with a heavy heart that the Embassy learned of the </p><p>tragic and senseless murder of Minister of Justice and </p><p>Attorney General Chief Bola Ige. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Chief Ige was a fine gentleman, a warm and helpful </p><p>interlocutor for the Embassy and a superlative son and </p><p>representative of Nigeria.  An eloquent and courageous </p><p>champion for the rule of law in Nigeria, he recognized the </p><p>serious threat posed by drug traffickers, organized crime and </p><p>corruption to Nigeria\'s stability and nascent democracy, and </p><p>used his position to push for reforms to strengthen Nigeria\'s </p><p>ability to counter these threats.  In November, because his </p><p>legal and leadership skills were recognized around the world, </p><p>he was elected by an overwhelming majority to the United </p><p>Nations\' International Law Commission. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>We take this opportunity to extend the profound condolences </p><p>of the Government and people of the United States to his wife </p><p>and family and to the Government and people of Nigeria. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>We will all deeply miss Chief Bola Ige.  May his soul rest in </p><p>perfect peace. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>End text. </p><p>Andrews </p><p></p></div>
