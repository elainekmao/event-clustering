<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 002991 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: 10/28/12 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, KDEM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: FORMER HEAD OF STATE ABUBAKAR THINKS </p><p>OBASANJO SHOULD GO! </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY HOWARD F. JETER. REASON 1.5 (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: According to former Head of State </p><p>Abdulsalami Abubakar, the October 10 dinner meeting </p><p>with Obasanjo, Babangida, VP Atiku, NSA Mohammed and </p><p>himself did not bridge differences between Obasanjo </p><p>and the others. Since no consensus on the way forward </p><p>was reached, Abubakar felt the best solution for </p><p>Nigeria\'s current electoral imbroglio was Obasanjo\'s </p><p>withdrawal from the Presidential contest.  Obasanjo\'s </p><p>cardinal failing has been his lack of pragmatism in </p><p>attempting to govern a vast, complex and diverse </p><p>Nigeria as if he were on a one-man crusade, alienating </p><p>important political interests and the National </p><p>Assembly in his drive for reform.  To Abubakar, </p><p>Obasanjo tried to change things too much, too quickly, </p><p>forgetting that an essential ingredient in Nigerian </p><p>politics was patronage. Abubakar considered VP Atiku a </p><p>strong possibility for the PDP Presidential </p><p>nomination.  However, he disavowed any insider </p><p>knowledge on the inscrutable Babangida and his next </p><p>moves.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p>----- </p><p>OBASANJO, BABANGIDA AND OTHERS DINE BUT FAIL TO BREAK </p><p>BREAD </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) During an October 18 afternoon with Ambassador </p><p>Jeter at the Ambassador\'s residence, former Head of </p><p>State Abubakar confirmed that Babangida, VP Atiku, NSA </p><p>Aliyu Mohammed and he dined with Obasanjo on October </p><p>10.  Contrary to press reports that the meeting helped </p><p>reconcile the quintet, Abubakar described the session </p><p>as inconclusive.  The meeting provided a chance to air </p><p>grievances and concerns, but the five men did not </p><p>agree on a way forward.  (Note: Abubakar also </p><p>confirmed South African President Mbeki\'s apparently </p><p>unsuccessful efforts in late September and in October </p><p>to reconcile Obasanjo with Babangida and the others. </p><p>End Note.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Given the high anxiety and political tension </p><p>caused by the approaching elections, Abubakar thought </p><p>Obasanjo\'s exit from the Presidential sweepstakes was </p><p>the key to alleviating stress in the political system. </p><p>Due to his lack of political skills, Obasanjo had </p><p>alienated his friends and deepened the enmity of his </p><p>foes.  The former military Head of State worried that </p><p>protracted squabbling over Obasanjo\'s succession bid </p><p>might cause further regional divisions pitting North </p><p>against South.  Because he now was the lighting rod in </p><p>Nigerian politics, the best way forward was for </p><p>Obasanjo to stand aside, Abubakar declared. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>OBASANJO, THE IMPOLITIC REFORMER </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Giving credit to Obasanjo for integrity, good </p><p>intentions, and a tireless work ethic, Abubakar </p><p>nonetheless blamed Obasanjo\'s decline on the </p><p>President\'s lack of political savvy and his impatient, </p><p>sometimes erratic push for reform. Obasanjo tried to </p><p>change too much, too quickly, without consulting and </p><p>trying to persuade others to embrace his actions. </p><p>Moreover, Abubakar said that Obasanjo presided over </p><p>government as his personal fiefdom where only his </p><p>opinions mattered. The President tried to control </p><p>everything, and no important decisions could be made </p><p>without him. By trying to do everything at once and by </p><p>not prioritizing, he had accomplished precious little, </p><p>Abubakar contended. Instead of turning the system on </p><p>its head, Obasanjo should have concentrated on three </p><p>or four key objectives.  By trying to do everything, </p><p>he achieved nothing and had not major accomplishments </p><p>to show for all of his efforts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>PATRONAGE, THE KEY TO REELECTION </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Abubakar said that Obasanjo seriously </p><p>jeopardized his political future by alienating people </p><p>who had worked hard for his election.  Obasanjo the </p><p>reformer had little sense of political reciprocity; </p><p>his refusal to return political favors was perceived </p><p>by many as rank ingratitude not principled reform </p><p>especially when some of Obasanjo\'s men, such as Works </p><p>and Housing Minister Tony Anenih, were involved in </p><p>corruption. Obasanjo should have realized that </p><p>Nigeria\'s political culture could not change </p><p>overnight. The people who helped Obasanjo expected </p><p>"some patronage." Patronage was an unavoidable fact of </p><p>life Nigerian politics. Obasanjo\'s dismissive remarks </p><p>that those who backed him in anticipation of favors </p><p>had made a "bad investment" had angered many political </p><p>investors. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Now that Obasanjo was coming back to ask their </p><p>help in reelection drive, they were turning away from </p><p>him.  Since their first investment in him was "bad," </p><p>Abubakar said that Obasanjo\'s former supporters saw no </p><p>reason to support him again.  Abubakar offered that </p><p>Obasanjo\'s drive for reform, coupled with an </p><p>exaggerated self-worth, blinded him to this crucial </p><p>political reality. In short, Obasanjo was not </p><p>pragmatic enough to be a good President, Abubakar </p><p>believed. (Comment: Abubakar was speaking from </p><p>personal experience. We have been told by one insider </p><p>of an occasion where Abubakar went to Obasanjo for </p><p>help -- we do not know if it was financial patronage. </p><p>However, we were told that Obasanjo abruptly showed </p><p>the former Head of State the door.  End Comment.) </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>NOT TO IMPEACH BUT TO SIDELINE </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Because of Obasanjo, the PDP was tearing </p><p>itself apart, observed Abubakar.  Obasanjo had set </p><p>himself against the National Assembly early in his </p><p>Administration.  He had undermined its leadership and </p><p>belittled its role in governance.  To a substantial </p><p>degree, the tables were now turned.  In response to </p><p>the Ambassador\'s direct question, Abubakar thought the </p><p>impeachment threat was not intended to remove Obasanjo </p><p>from office but to deny him the PDPD renomination. </p><p>Again, this was a struggle in the realm of practical </p><p>politics, noted Abubakar. Assembly Members need to </p><p>bring some money and projects to their constituents to </p><p>help secure reelection; local voters only think a </p><p>politician is good if he can give them money or has </p><p>finagled a project or two for their community. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) By initially refusing to fund capital and other </p><p>constituency projects, Obasanjo was undermining </p><p>Assembly Members\' reelection chances.  When he finally </p><p>realized the political implications of the impeachment </p><p>threat, Obasanjo moved to fund many of these projects. </p><p>By then, however, so much bad blood had developed that </p><p>Obasanjo\'s corrective measures did not engender </p><p>goodwill. They caused bewilderment. People wondered </p><p>why it took Obasanjo so long to do the politically </p><p>obvious, Abubakar declared. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Pointing out the numerous meetings that have </p><p>taken place in the past few weeks without yet </p><p>resolving the conflict between the President and his </p><p>antagonists within the PDP, Abubakar said party </p><p>officials were finding it difficult to identify common </p><p>ground between the two sides.  Obasanjo created this </p><p>strong adversarial relationship because he disdained </p><p>the Assembly; now its members feel that either he or </p><p>they must go. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Abubakar further commented that the schism </p><p>between Obasanjo and his Vice President was real. </p><p>While professing non-involvement in party politics, </p><p>Abubakar believed that a bid for the PDP nomination by </p><p>VP Atiku was a strong possibility.  However, Abubakar </p><p>professed no knowledge of Babangida\'s next moves, even </p><p>though the two are neighbors and reportedly best </p><p>friends. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) The fence-mending dinner with Babangida, </p><p>Abubakar and others seems to have fallen short of </p><p>Obasanjo\'s expectations. If Abubakar is an accurate </p><p>barometer, the meeting may have brought home to </p><p>Obasanjo some of his past missteps, but it did not </p><p>bring the expressions of current and future support </p><p>Obasanjo wanted from the "big four."  We concur with </p><p>Abubakar\'s assessment of Obasanjo\'s political </p><p>troubles: It is not so much Obasanjo\'s gruff exterior </p><p>but his miserliness. His weakness has been that he did </p><p>not, or could not, play "the game" according to local </p><p>rules. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) Abubakar\'s identification of patronage as the </p><p>fulcrum also helps place what may be at stake in the </p><p>coming election. In one corner, there is Obasanjo, the </p><p>often-inconsistent reformer who lacks political savvy. </p><p>In the other, there is a steady stream of people who </p><p>might be much better politicians than Obasanjo but </p><p>whose bonds to "politics as usual" are decidedly </p><p>stronger than their or Obasanjo\'s commitment to </p><p>reform. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
