<p>UNCLAS TEGUCIGALPA 001722 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR WHA/PDA (JGREENBLATT); WHA/CEN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: OIIP, PREL, KPAO, PGOV, IZ, HO </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON DRUGS, JULY 21, 2003 </p><p> </p><p>1. Op-ed by Julio Escoto in Tegucigalpa-based moderate daily "El </p><p>Heraldo" entitled "Trapped". "When did the US get trapped by </p><p>drugs? Definitely during the 1960s and 1970s with the hippie </p><p>generation and after the Marines got back from Vietnam, when the </p><p>Americans got a chance to experience the horror of war and the </p><p>deceit of their political class. Then, drugs became the spiritual </p><p>leaders of that generation, tired of unfulfilled promises and </p><p>fragile leadership." </p><p> </p><p>"Drugs aren\'t unknown to the American culture, they have always </p><p>been part of the menu of that growing empire. However, there is a </p><p>slight difference: in previous decades drugs addiction was a </p><p>discrete activity, now it isn\'t. According to the DEA, there are </p><p>about twenty million Americans smoking marijuana in a regular </p><p>basis, forty million have tried cocaine at least once and no less </p><p>than seven million have tried crack, amphetamines, LSD or other </p><p>chemical or natural drug." </p><p> </p><p>"The figures are overwhelming, the drug business is the most </p><p>profitable activity in the US. That is why the Colombian, </p><p>Mexican, Israeli, Turkish and Russian mobs have made the US a </p><p>paradise to sell drugs. As a result, Mexico and Central America </p><p>have become the natural route to transport drugs to the US. It\'s </p><p>believed that about 60% of the cocaine sold in the US has passed </p><p>through this region." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
