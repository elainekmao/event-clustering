(C) ON DECEMBER 15, POLICE CHARGED OPPOSITION MOVEMENT </p><p>FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC) LEADER MORGAN TSVANGIRAI UNDER </p><p>THE POSTAL AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACT WITH POSSESSING AN </p><p>UNLICENSED RADIO.  THE RADIO WAS A WALKIE-TALKIE USED BY </p><p>ONE OF HIS BODYGUARDS.  AFTER INSTRUCTING TSVANGIRAI TO </p><p>WRITE A STATEMENT ACKNOWLEDGING THE PRESENCE OF THE RADIO </p><p>IN HIS HOME AND THAT NO LICENSE HAD BEEN OBTAINED FOR IT, </p><p>POLICE SAID HE COULD EXPECT A SUMMONS LATER IN THE WEEK TO </p><p>APPEAR IN COURT.  TSVANGIRAI TOLD JOURNALISTS THAT THE </p><p>RADIO BELONGED TO THE MDC AS A PARTY, NOT TO HIM </p><p>PERSONALLY.  INNOCENT CHAGONDA, TSVANGIRAI\'S ATTORNEY, TOLD </p><p>US THAT THE POSTAL AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACT PROVIDES FOR </p><p>A MAXIMUM PENALTY UPON CONVICTION ON THIS CHARGE OF A FINE </p><p>OF UP TO 200,000 ZIMBABWEAN DOLLARS (APPROXIMATELY U.S. </p><p>$600) AND/OR UP TO TWO YEARS IMPRISONMENT.  HE TOLD US IT </p><p>IS NOT CLEAR THAT THE ACT APPLIES IN THIS CASE, AS THE </p><p>MDC HAD PURCHASED THE RADIO BEFORE THE LAW CAME INTO EFFECT </p><p>LAST YEAR.  CHAGONDA DISMISSED THE CHARGE AS PURE </p><p>HARASSMENT, AND SAID HE HAD NO DOUBT THAT THE GOZ "WILL </p><p>COME UP WITH SOMETHING ELSE AGAINST TSVANGIRAI BY JANUARY." </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) THE FILING OF CHARGES FOLLOWED SEVERAL DAYS OF </p><p>POLICE HARASSMENT OF TSVANGIRAI.  AT 12:30 A.M. ON DECEMBER </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03739  171459Z </p><p>13, POLICE, ARMED WITH A SEARCH WARRANT, SEARCHED THE MDC </p><p>LEADER\'S HOUSE FOR SOMEONE THEY SAID WAS WANTED IN </p><p>CONNECTION WITH THE RECENT MURDER OF BULAWAYO WAR VETERAN </p><p>LEADER CAIN NKALA.  POLICE DID NOT FIND THE ALLEGED </p><p>FUGITIVE BUT MUST HAVE SEEN THE BODYGUARD\'S WALKIE-TALKIE </p><p>SITTING IN ITS CHARGER, PROVIDING THE PERFECT EXCUSE FOR A </p><p>RETURN VISIT.  AT 5:30 A.M. ON DECEMBER 14, POLICE RETURNED </p><p>TO TSVANGIRAI\'S HOUSE, THIS TIME TAKING HIM TO HARARE\'S </p><p>CENTRAL POLICE STATION.  THE MDC LEADER WAS ONLY </p><p>ASKED TO PRODUCE A LICENSE FOR THE RADIO, BUT WAS RELEASED </p><p>AT THAT POINT WITHOUT CHARGE AFTER THREE HOURS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) GANDI MUDZINGWA, TSVANGIRAI\'S SPECIAL ASSISTANT, </p><p>SURMISED THAT THE GOZ IS TRYING TO MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR </p><p>TSVANGIRAI TO CAMPAIGN AROUND THE COUNTRY BY KEEPING HIM </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>TIED DOWN IN HARARE ON CONTRIVED LEGAL MATTERS.   CLIVE </p><p>PUZEY, WHO SERVES AS TSVANGIRAI\'S INFORMAL INTELLIGENCE </p><p>CHIEF, EXPRESSED MORE SERIOUS CONCERN ABOUT THE LENGTHS TO </p><p>WHICH AN INCREASINGLY DESPERATE GOVERNMENT MIGHT GO.  PUZEY </p><p>TOLD US HE HAS ARRANGED TO SPIRIT AWAY THE MDC LEADERSHIP </p><p>TO SAFEHOUSES AROUND THE COUNTRY SHOULD THE SECURITY </p><p>SITUATION DETERIORATE SIGNIFICANTLY.  HE ALSO BELIEVES THE </p><p>PARTY OUGHT TO EXPLORE A LAST RESORT OPTION OF ESTABLISHING </p><p>A GOVERNMENT-IN-EXILE IN EITHER BOTSWANA OR SOUTH AFRICA </p><p>AND IS SEEKING TSVANGIRAI\'S GO-AHEAD TO FEEL OUT THOSE TWO </p><p>GOVERNMENTS ON THIS POSSIBILITY.  PUZEY AND OTHERS AROUND </p><p>TSVANGIRAI ARE MORE AND MORE CONCERNED THAT AN INCREASINGLY </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>DESPERATE MUGABE MIGHT BE DRIVEN TO TAKE HIM OUT OR THAT, </p><p>AT THE VERY LEAST, BELLICOSE PRESIDENTIAL RHETORIC MIGHT </p><p>ENCOURAGE ZANU-PF SYMPATHIZERS TO MAKE SUCH AN ATTEMPT. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03739  171459Z </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) IT IS LIKELY NO CONCIDENCE THAT THE DETENTION OF </p><p>TSVANGIRAI OCCURRED AT THE SAME TIME AS THE ZANU-PF </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>CONGRESS IN VICTORIA FALLS, WHERE PRESIDENT MUGABE </p><p>OFFICIALLY LAUNCHED HIS PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN BY DECLARING </p><p>WAR ON THE MDC (SEPTEL).  THE TREATMENT OF TSVANGIRAI </p><p>CONSTITUTES SIMPLE HARASSMENT OF A LEGITIMATE POLITICAL </p><p>LEADER -- THE RADIO POSSESSION CHARGE PROVIDED MERELY A </p><p>HANDY PRETEXT -- AND WAS THE LATEST EPISODE IN THE GOZ\'S </p><p>ONGOING EFFORT TO KEEP THE MDC LEADERSHIP OFF-BALANCE AND </p><p>FORCE IT TO SPEND SCARCE RESOURCES ON LEGAL FEES. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
