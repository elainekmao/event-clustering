ROSSIN, REASONS 1.5(B) </p><p>AND (D) AND 1.6 </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) THOMAS OSORIO, HEAD OF ICTY\'S ZAGREB OFFICE, TOLD US </p><p>THAT OTP SPOKESPERSON FLORENCE HARTMANN\'S FEBRUARY 5 </p><p>STATEMENT CRITICIZING THE GOC FOR FAILING TO APPREHEND ICTY </p><p>INDICTEE ANTE GOTOVINA AND FOR FAILING TO MEET ICTY </p><p>INFORMATION REQUESTS REPRESENTS THE OPENING SALVO OF A NEW </p><p>OTP BID TO PRESS THE GOC TO TAKE MORE VISIBLE ACTION TO </p><p>ARREST THE FUGITIVE.  OSORIO SAID THE OTP IS "CONVINCED" THAT </p><p>THE GOTOVINA IS HIDING IN CROATIA, BUT WAS UNWILLING (OR </p><p>UNABLE) TO OFFER CONCRETE EVIDENCE TO SUBSTANTIATE HARTMANN\'S </p><p>HARSH CLAIMS.  OSORIO, WHO WAS NOT/NOT CONSULTED BEFORE </p><p>HARTMANN\'S PRESS STATEMENT, THOUGHT THAT HER CRITICISM OF GOC </p><p>DOCUMENT SHARING LAPSES WAS OVERSTATED. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) WHILE THE OTP OFTEN HAS GOOD REASON TO BE FRUSTRATED </p><p>WITH THE GOC -- IT IS A RELUCTANT AND FAIR WEATHER PARTNER </p><p>-- THE OTP URGENTLY NEEDS TO IMPROVE THE MANAGEMENT OF ITS </p><p>"CROATIA ACCOUNT."  MISSTEPS IN THE NOW-SUSPENDED BOBETKO WAR </p><p>CRIMES CASE, PARTICULARLY THE OTP DECISION NOT TO INTERVIEW </p><p>THE SUSPECT BEFORE INDICTING HIM (REF C), HELPED FOSTER A </p><p>CRISIS THAT WRACKED THE GOC IN FALL 2002, DIMINISHED ICTY\'S </p><p>CREDIBILITY HERE AND COMPLICATED CROATIAN EU ASPIRATIONS WITH </p><p>NOTHING TO SHOW FOR THE EFFORT.  WE SHOULD CONTINUE TO PRESS </p><p>THE GOC ON GOTOVINA AND ICTY COOPERATION WRIT LARGE. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00305  01 OF 03  120643Z </p><p>HOWEVER, PRESSURE MUST BE WELL ORCHESTRATED AND WELL THOUGHT </p><p>OUT.  WITHOUT SOLID GROUNDING IN FACT, BETTER INTERNAL </p><p>COORDINATION AND PRIOR CONSULTATION WITH US AND ICTY\'S OTHER </p><p>SUPPORTERS, THE OTP\'S GOTOVINA "STRATEGY" MAY END UP BEING </p><p>JUST ANOTHER FUTILE AND PYRRHIC CONFRONTATION WITH THE GOC. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>FIGHTING WORDS... </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  IN THE STRONGEST LANGUAGE USED BY AN ICTY OFFICIAL </p><p>SINCE THE CRISIS OVER GENERAL BOBETKO FLARED IN SEPTEMBER </p><p>2002, HARTMANN ACCUSED THE GOC OF FAILING TO APPREHEND </p><p>FUGITIVE CROATIAN GENERAL AND ICTY INDICTEE ANTE GOTOVINA. </p><p>GOTOVINA, HARTMANN ALLEGED, WAS "TRAVELING FREELY IN </p><p>CROATIA."  HARTMANN ALSO ACCUSED THE GOC OF "SELECTIVE, SLOW </p><p>AND INCOMPLETE COMPLIANCE WITH SPECIFIC REQUESTS FOR </p><p>DOCUMENTS." </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) IN LIGHT OF HARTMANN\'S STATEMENT, WE MET FEBRUARY 6 </p><p>WITH ICTY ZAGREB OFFICE RESREP THOMAS OSORIO (PROTECT </p><p>THROUGHOUT).  ALTHOUGH HE WOULD NOT -- OR COULD NOT -- GO </p><p>INTO DETAILS, OSORIO ASSERTED THAT THE OTP HAS EVIDENCE TO </p><p>BACK UP HARTMANN\'S ACCUSATION ON GOTOVINA.  THERE ARE "NEW </p><p>SIGHTINGS AND NEW INFORMATION," ALTHOUGH HE SAID THAT NONE OF </p><p>THE NEW LEADS ARE AS SOLID AS THE REPORTED SFOR SIGHTING OF </p><p>GOTOVINA IN HERCEGOVINA IN 2002 (REF D).  IN SUM, ICTY NOW IS </p><p>CONVINCED THAT GOTOVINA IS MOVING IN AND OUT OF CROATIA AND </p><p>THAT THE GOC HAS NOT/NOT BEEN ACTING IN GOOD FAITH TO </p><p>APPREHEND HIM.  OSORIO NOTED THAT IF THE EU MADE GOTOVINA\'S </p><p>CAPTURE A PRECONDITION FOR ACTING ON CROATIA\'S EU MEMBERSHIP </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00305  01 OF 03  120643Z </p><p>APPLICATION, THE GOC WOULD CAPTURE THE GENERAL WITHIN "24 </p><p>HOURS." </p><p> </p><p>...AND A NEW OTP "STRATEGY" </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  DURING OUR DISCUSSION, OSORIO CALLED HARTMANN AND </p><p>CONFIRMED THAT HER STATEMENT WAS ISSUED UNDER INSTRUCTIONS </p><p>FROM CHIEF PROSECUTOR DEL PONTE.  OSORIO CONCLUDED THAT HER </p><p>STATEMENT WAS THE OPENING SALVO OF A NEW ICTY "STRATEGY" TO </p><p>FORCE THE GOC TO TAKE STRONGER ACTION TO FIND GOTOVINA, OR </p><p>SHOULD THE GOC BALK, DEMONSTRATE CATEGORICALLY THAT CROATIA </p><p>IS FAILING TO COMPLY WITH ITS ICTY OBLIGATIONS.   ACCORDING </p><p>TO OSORIO, THIS STRATEGY WOULD CALL FOR CROATIAN LAW </p><p>ENFORCEMENT TO CONDUCT HIGH VISIBILITY RAIDS ON GOTOVINA\'S </p><p>HOMES, INTERVIEW GOTOVINA\'S ATTORNEYS AND ASSOCIATES AND </p><p>MOUNT ROADBLOCKS IN AREAS OF DALMATIA WHERE THE SUSPECT IS </p><p>BELIEVED TO FREQUENT.  ICTY STAFF WILL ACTIVELY MONITOR THESE </p><p>AND OTHER ACTIVITIES AND MAY SEEK TO ACCOMPANY THE POLICE ON </p><p>THEIR RAIDS TO VERIFY GOC COMPLIANCE. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) OSORIO SAID THAT THIS NEW AGGRESSIVE STRATEGY HAS BEEN </p><p>THE CAUSE OF MUCH DEBATE WITHIN ICTY BETWEEN "ACTIVISTS," WHO </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ7424 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  00305  02 OF 03  120644Z </p><p>ACTION SWCI-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   CIAE-00  DODE-00  SRPP-00  EUR-00   VC-00    TEDE-00 </p><p>      INR-00   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OMB-01 </p><p>      PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    SS-00 </p><p>      TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00  PMB-00   DRL-01   G-00     SAS-00 </p><p>        /003W </p><p>                  ------------------34D23A  120644Z /20 </p><p>P 111735Z FEB 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 9419 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY BELGRADE PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY LONDON PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY MOSCOW PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY SARAJEVO PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY THE HAGUE PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 ZAGREB 000305 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EUR, EUR/SCE, S/WCI </p><p>THE HAGUE FOR JOHNSON/KAYE/WHEATON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 1.6X6 5 YEARS AFTER CLOSURE OF ICTY </p><p>TAGS: KAWC, ICTY, PGOV, PREL, HR RV </p><p>SUBJECT: DOES THE OTP HAVE A STRATEGY FOR CROATIA? </p><p> </p><p>WANT TO USE ICTY\'S LEVERAGE TO PUSH THE GOC TO FIND GOTOVINA, </p><p>AND "LEGALISTS," WHO BELIEVE THAT ICTY\'S SOLE FUNCTION IS TO </p><p>RULE ON COMPLIANCE/NON-COMPLIANCE AND INFORM THE UNSC OF ITS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00305  02 OF 03  120644Z </p><p>FINDINGS.  (OSORIO LISTED HIMSELF AND CHIEF PROSECUTOR DEL </p><p>PONTE AS "ACTIVISTS.")  OSORIO SAID THAT THE ICTY ALREADY HAS </p><p>RECEIVED A PROTEST NOTE FROM THE RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR IN THE </p><p>HAGUE ACCUSING THE TRIBUNAL OF A DOUBLE STANDARD FOLLOWING </p><p>DEL PONTE\'S SPEECH TO THE UN LAST OCTOBER -- A SPEECH IN </p><p>WHICH SHE DECLARED SERBIA TO BE IN NON-COMPLIANCE FOR ITS </p><p>FAILURE TO DELIVER RATKO MLADIC, BUT ONLY WARNED CROATIA OVER </p><p>ITS FAILURE TO DELIVER GOTOVINA.  OSORIO EXPECTS MORE </p><p>COMPLAINTS FROM THE RUSSIANS OVER THE OTP\'S GOTOVINA GAMBIT; </p><p>HE ANTICIPATED THAT THE RUSSIANS WILL INSIST AGAIN THAT ICTY </p><p>SHOULD DECLARE CROATIA NON-COMPLIANT.  HOWEVER, OSORIO ARGUES </p><p>THAT, UNLIKE THE MLADIC CASE, THE OTP NEEDS TO PRESS FOR </p><p>VISIBLE ACTION TO DEBUNK THE GOC ARGUMENT THAT GOTOVINA FLED </p><p>THE REGION. </p><p> </p><p>WHERE\'S THE PROOF? </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) OTP FRUSTRATION WITH GOC PASSIVITY ON GOTOVINA IS </p><p>UNDERSTANDABLE; THE GOC DREADS THE PROSPECT OF HAVING TO </p><p>TRANSFER GOTOVINA TO THE HAGUE AND DESPERATELY DOES NOT WANT </p><p>THE GENERAL TO BE IN CROATIA.  HOWEVER, OUR EXPERIENCE WITH </p><p>MUCH OF WHAT WE KNOW OF THE OTP\'S "EVIDENCE" ON GOTOVINA IS </p><p>THAT IT IS BASED ON CIRCULAR REPORTING AND HEARSAY.  WHILE </p><p>GOTOVINA VERY WELL MAY BE IN THE REGION, WE HAVE SEEN </p><p>NOTHING, ASIDE FROM THE SFOR SIGHTING, TO UNDERPIN THE HARSH </p><p>OTP STATEMENT THAT GOTOVINA IS "WALKING FREELY" IN CROATIA </p><p>(AND WE HAVE BEEN ASKING OSORIO AND THE CROATIANS FOR </p><p>MONTHS).  PER REF B, OTP POLITICAL ADVISOR JEAN-JAQUES JORIS </p><p>TOLD OUR COLLEAGUES IN THE HAGUE THAT "CROATIAN AND FOREIGN </p><p>SOURCES" SUPPORTED THE OTP CLAIM THAT GOTOVINA WAS MOVING </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00305  02 OF 03  120644Z </p><p>FREELY IN CROATIA.  HE SAID THAT THE CROATIAN SOURCE WAS (OR </p><p>INCLUDED) PRESIDENT MESIC.  HOWEVER, MESIC\'S FOREIGN POLICY </p><p>ADVISOR TOLD US THAT MESIC BASED HIS STATEMENT ON A CROATIAN </p><p>INTELLIGENCE REPORT, WHICH, WE KNOW FOR A FACT, WAS BASED ON </p><p>A FALSE SIGHTING OF GOTOVINA IN ZAGREB AND OTHER CIRCULAR </p><p>REPORTING.  OTHER REPORTED "SIGHTINGS" OF GOTOVINA HAVE </p><p>PROVEN TO BE EQUALLY UNSUBSTANTIATED. </p><p> </p><p>DOCUMENT SHARING </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) OSORIO SAID HE WAS NOT CONSULTED BEFORE HARTMANN </p><p>ISSUED HER STATEMENT.  IN HIS VIEW CRITICISM OF THE GOC\'S </p><p>PERFORMANCE ON INFORMATION SHARING WAS OVERSTATED AND THE </p><p>GOC, AS A RULE, WAS RESPONSIVE ON DOCUMENT REQUESTS. </p><p>ACCORDING TO OSORIO, THERE ARE THREE OUTSTANDING DOCUMENT </p><p>DELIVERY PROBLEMS:  1) THE GOC HAS FAILED TO DELIVER BODY </p><p>COUNT AND AUTOPSY RESULTS CONDUCTED BY THE CROATIAN MILITARY </p><p>AFTER OPERATION STORM; 2) THE GOC HAS NOT MET A DEADLINE TO </p><p>PROVIDE DEMOGRAPHIC DATA WHICH ICTY NEEDS TO HELP DEMONSTRATE </p><p>YUGOSLAV ETHNIC CLEANSING FOR THE MILOSEVIC TRIAL; AND 3) THE </p><p>GOC HAS MISSED A NUMBER OF DEADLINES ON INFORMATION LINKED TO </p><p>INVESTIGATIONS OF CROATIAN WAR CRIMES IN BOSNIA.  IN THE CASE </p><p>OF THE FIRST TWO DOCUMENT SHARING ISSUES, OSORIO TOLD US THAT </p><p>THE GOC FAILURE TO DELIVER THE DOCUMENTS WAS A TECHNICAL, </p><p>SHORT-TERM HICCUP.  IN FACT, IN THE CASE OF THE BODY COUNT </p><p>INFORMATION, OSORIO SAID THAT HE HAD OBTAINED A BOOTLEG COPY </p><p>FROM THE HEAD OF THE GOC COMMISSION FOR MISSING PERSONS.  IN </p><p>THE CASE OF THE OUTSTANDING BIH INFORMATION, THE ISSUE COULD </p><p>HAVE BEEN HANDLED "THROUGH REGULAR CHANNELS," OSORIO </p><p>ASSERTED. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00305  02 OF 03  120644Z </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) ALTHOUGH PROBLEMS EXIST, THERE IS ALSO PROGRESS. </p><p>OSORIO CONFIRMED THAT THE GOC GAVE PERMISSION FOR THE OTP AND </p><p>THE CROATIAN PROSECUTORS\' OFFICE TO BEGIN TO SHARE </p><p>INFORMATION DIRECTLY.  AN ICTY PROSECUTOR WAS SENT TO ZAGREB </p><p>FEBRUARY 5 TO WORK WITH HIS COUNTERPARTS TO SOLIDIFY THE </p><p>CROATIAN CASE AGAINST LOWER LEVEL PERPETRATORS IN THE MEDAK </p><p>POCKET AND TO SEEK ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO BOLSTER THE </p><p>OTP\'S CASE AGAINST GENERAL ADEMI FOR CRIMES COMMITTED IN THE </p><p>SAME OPERATION. </p><p> </p><p>BOBETKO: CASE FROZEN </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) OSORIO CONFIRMED THAT, AFTER REVIEWING THE ICTY </p><p>MEDICAL SPECIALISTS\' REPORT, CHIEF PROSECUTOR DEL PONTE </p><p>RECOMMENDED TO THE PRESIDING JUDGE THAT THE TRIAL OF FORMER </p><p>CROATIAN CHIEF OF THE GENERAL STAFF JANKO BOBETKO BE </p><p>SUSPENDED BECAUSE OF HIS POOR HEALTH.  ICTY WILL SEND ANOTHER </p><p>MEDICAL TEAM TO ZAGREB IN THREE TO FOUR MONTHS TO REVIEW </p><p>BOBETKO\'S HEALTH, BUT BARRING A MIRACULOUS RECOVERY FROM </p><p>PROGRESSIVE HEART AND RENAL FAILURE, OTP\'S PURSUIT OF THE </p><p>HIGHEST RANKING CROATIAN TO BE INDICTED BY ICTY IS AT AND </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ7428 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  00305  03 OF 03  120645Z </p><p>ACTION SWCI-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   CIAE-00  DODE-00  SRPP-00  EUR-00   VC-00    TEDE-00 </p><p>      INR-00   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OMB-01 </p><p>      PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    SS-00 </p><p>      TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00  PMB-00   DRL-01   G-00     SAS-00 </p><p>        /003W </p><p>                  ------------------34D24F  120645Z /20 </p><p>P 111735Z FEB 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 9420 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY BELGRADE PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY LONDON PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY MOSCOW PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY SARAJEVO PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY THE HAGUE PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 ZAGREB 000305 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EUR, EUR/SCE, S/WCI </p><p>THE HAGUE FOR JOHNSON/KAYE/WHEATON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 1.6X6 5 YEARS AFTER CLOSURE OF ICTY </p><p>TAGS: KAWC, ICTY, PGOV, PREL, HR RV </p><p>SUBJECT: DOES THE OTP HAVE A STRATEGY FOR CROATIA? </p><p> </p><p>END.  OSORIO DID NOT INDICATE THAT THE OTP WOULD CONDUCT A </p><p>"LESSONS LEARNED" EXERCISE OVER BOBETKO.  HE DID EXPRESS </p><p>HOPE, HOWEVER, THAT IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE BOBETKO CRISIS, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00305  03 OF 03  120645Z </p><p>ICTY FINALLY WOULD ESTABLISH THE BASIC STANDARDS WHICH WOULD </p><p>HELP PROSECUTORS DETERMINE THE FITNESS OF AN INDICTEE TO </p><p>STAND TRIAL. </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) WITH BOBETKO OUT OF THE PICTURE, THE OTP IS </p><p>STRUGGLING TO MAKE SENSE OF ITS PROSECUTION STRATEGY FOR THE </p><p>ENTIRE MEDAK POCKET WAR CRIMES CASE.  BOBETKO WAS AT THE TOP </p><p>OF THE PYRAMID OF THE MILITARY CHAIN OF COMMAND -- INDICTEE </p><p>RAHIM ADEMI WAS THE CHIEF MILITARY OFFICER IN THE FIELD. </p><p>GENERAL MIRKO NORAC, WHOSE INDICTMENT WAS DEFERRED AT THE </p><p>REQUEST OF THE GOC SO THAT IT COULD TRY A SEPARATE WAR CRIMES </p><p>CASE ("GOSPIC") LOCALLY, HEADED THE CROATIAN MILITARY UNIT </p><p>PRINCIPALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ATROCITIES AT MEDAK.  WITH </p><p>BOBETKO GONE, OSORIO SAID THAT THE OTP WILL HAVE TO REEXAMINE </p><p>THE INDICTMENT AGAINST ADEMI AND THE PENDING INDICTMENT </p><p>AGAINST NORAC.  (OSORIO TOLD US THAT ICTY RECENTLY HAD </p><p>DISCUSSED WITH CHIEF PROSECUTOR MLADEN BAJIC THE POSSIBILITY </p><p>THAT HE INCLUDE NORAC IN THE LOCAL CROATIAN INDICTMENT OF </p><p>LOWER-LEVEL SOLDIERS THAT BAJIC IS PREPARING.) </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) ACCORDING TO OSORIO, MEDAK IS IMPORTANT FOR ICTY, NOT </p><p>JUST BECAUSE THE OTP BELIEVES THIS TO BE ONE OF THEIR </p><p>STRONGEST CROATIA CASES, BUT BECAUSE IT WILL BE A TEST-BED </p><p>FOR ITS EFFORTS TO PROVE THAT THE GOC CONCEPTUALIZED AND </p><p>PRE-PLANNED THE 1995 OPERATION STORM AS AN ETHNIC CLEANSING </p><p>OPERATION.  OSORIO HAS TOLD US THAT THE PROSECUTION BELIEVES </p><p>IT HAS EVIDENCE THAT THE SAME ORGANIZED TECHNIQUES TO RAZE </p><p>SERB VILLAGES IN MEDAK WERE USED ON A WIDER SCALE AFTER </p><p>OPERATION STORM. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00305  03 OF 03  120645Z </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) THE OTP IS UNDERSTANDABLY FRUSTRATED.  THE BOBETKO </p><p>CASE, AND YEARS AND YEARS OF WORK, IS SLIPPING AWAY WITHOUT A </p><p>DAY IN COURT.  JUSTICE IS DENIED AND THE GOC, WHICH EVADED </p><p>FOR MONTHS ITS RESPONSIBILITY TO ACT AS ICTY\'S AGENT ON THE </p><p>CASE, HAS COME OUT THE WINNER.  THE BRITISH, WHO WENT OUT ON </p><p>A LIMB TO SUPPORT THE OTP ON BOBETKO BY SUSPENDING CROATIA\'S </p><p>STABILIZATION AND ASSOCIATION AGREEMENT, ARE FURIOUS WITH THE </p><p>OTP ABOUT THIS.  SO ARE WE.  IN THE PROCESS OF BACKING DEL </p><p>PONTE, WE DAMAGED OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER </p><p>GORAN GRANIC, ONE OF THE GOC\'S KEY DECISIONMAKERS.  AS A </p><p>RESULT OF THE BOBETKO CRISIS, THOSE IN CROATIA -- INCLUDING </p><p>THOSE WITHIN THE GOC -- WHO ARGUED THAT CROATIA SHOULD HOLD </p><p>FIRM FOR A SOLUTION MORE TO ITS LIKING WERE VINDICATED.  THEY </p><p>MAY BE EMBOLDENED TO TAKE THE SAME HARD, "WE KNOW BETTER," </p><p>STANCE ON NEW ICTY INDICTMENTS OR ON OTHER THORNY ISSUES SUCH </p><p>AS REFUGEE RETURN. </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) THE OTP\'S ACTIONS HAVE ENORMOUS CONSEQUENCES FOR </p><p>CROATIA, THE REGION AND US.  BOBETKO\'S REAL AND SERIOUS </p><p>MEDICAL AILMENTS WERE WELL KNOWN -- A RESPECTED CROATIAN </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS LEADER TOLD THE AMBASSADOR SHORTLY AFTER BOBETKO </p><p>WAS INDICTED THAT "NO ONE WHO KNEW BOBETKO\'S MEDICAL </p><p>CONDITION WOULD HAVE INDICTED HIM," AND WONDERED WHY DEL </p><p>PONTE DECIDED NOT TO DO SO.  AS REPORTED REF D, DEL PONTE -- </p><p>DESPITE GOC REQUESTS AND OTP STAFF INTENT -- PASSED UP AN </p><p>OPPORTUNITY TO INTERVIEW THE 83-YEAR OLD GENERAL BEFORE </p><p>ISSUING THE INDICTMENT, APPARENTLY FOR NO SOLID REASON. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00305  03 OF 03  120645Z </p><p>15. (C) HARTMANN\'S UNSUBSTANTIATED STATEMENT, THE OTP\'S LACK </p><p>OF CONSULTATION WITH ITS OWN REPRESENTATIVE ON THE GROUND, </p><p>AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF A "STRATEGY" WITHOUT PRIOR DISCUSSION </p><p>WITH THE ICTY\'S INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY SUPPORTERS SUGGESTS </p><p>THAT THE OTP WILL STUMBLE AGAIN, THIS TIME ON THE GOTOVINA </p><p>CASE.  THE OTP MUST DO BETTER.  AS A FIRST STEP, WE SHOULD </p><p>DEMAND THAT THE OTP PRESENT TO US ITS EVIDENCE THAT GOTOVINA </p><p>IS "FREELY MOVING" IN CROATIA.  AS THINGS STAND, WE ARE </p><p>SKEPTICAL OTP HAS EVIDENCE -- WE SHOULD DEMAND TO KNOW.  IF </p><p>IT DOES HAVE EVIDENCE AND IT IS CREDIBLE,  WE SHOULD INSIST </p><p>THAT THE OTP CONSULT WITH US AND THE BRITISH ABOUT ITS </p><p>"STRATEGY" FOR PRESSING THE GOC TO ACT.  THE QUESTION IS NOT </p><p>WHETHER WE SHOULD PRESS THE GOC ON WAR CRIMES AND ICTY </p><p>COOPERATION, BUT HOW TO ORCHESTRATE THAT PRESSURE TO THE BEST </p><p>EFFECT.  OTHERWISE, WE RISK GOING OUT ON A LIMB AGAIN FOR DEL </p><p>PONTE ONLY TO HAVE IT BREAK UNDER US. </p><p>ROSSIN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
