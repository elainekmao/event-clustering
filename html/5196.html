<p>UNCLAS ANKARA 000470 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE ALSO FOR E, EB AND EUR/SE </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA -- MILLS AND LEICHTER </p><p>NSC FOR QUANRUD AND BRYZA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, PGOV, ECON, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: LATEST EMBASSY MEETINGS ON ECONOMIC REFORM </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. (A) ANKARA 326 </p><p>     B. (B) ANKARA 301 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Embassy pressed the economic reform message January </p><p>16-17 in meetings with State Planning Under Secretary Ahmet </p><p>Tiktik, Parliamentary Budget Committee Chairman Sait Acba, </p><p>and AK Parliamentarian (and former Finance Minister official) </p><p>Bulent Gidikli.  In each of the meetings, we noted that we, </p><p>the IMF, the World Bank, and -- most importantly -- the </p><p>markets shared serious concerns about the direction of the </p><p>government\'s economic policy.  We also reiterated that any </p><p>U.S. assistance related to Iraq would be conditioned on </p><p>Turkish implementation of the reform program and, in any </p><p>case, could not substitute for sound policy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Tiktik, Acba and Gidikli all argued that the </p><p>government was fully committed to economic reform, would </p><p>avoid populist spending policies, and was moving in the right </p><p>direction.  Acba argued that the markets had confidence in </p><p>the government, and blamed concerns about Iraq for the recent </p><p>market decline.  We pointed to the government\'s spending </p><p>measures, movement to pass a tax "truce," and effort to gut </p><p>the public procurement law as examples of steps in the wrong </p><p>direction that undermined market confidence and raised </p><p>serious questions about the ability of the IMF and World Bank </p><p>to disburse.  AK still had a chance to recapture market </p><p>confidence and restore the post-election momentum, but it </p><p>needed to move quickly and wisely. Turkey\'s enormous debt </p><p>burden, we warned, meant there was little room for error. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)   Tiktik agreed that the government had to reach </p><p>the 6.5 percent of GNP primary surplus target, and said Prime </p><p>Minister Gul would chair a January 18 meeting of the High </p><p>Planning Council to consider specific fiscal measures to </p><p>achieve that goal.  Acba and Gidikli echoed the commitment to </p><p>the primary surplus, but stressed the need to address "social </p><p>problems."  They also defended proposed amendments to the </p><p>procurement law, saying they were necessary to fix flaws that </p><p>made the law inoperable.  We responded that we understood the </p><p>desire to help the poor, but that spending measures such as </p><p>increasing civil service pensions did not help the poor (who </p><p>do not receive pensions).  We also noted that the investor </p><p>community, World Bank, IMF, and the EU all strongly opposed </p><p>the proposed amendments to the procurement law. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  Comment: Embassy will continue to deliver the </p><p>economic reform message to senior officials, party members </p><p>and parliamentarians in the days ahead.  We note some </p><p>positive developments in recent days, such as new fiscal </p><p>measures and an ambitious privatization program, but do not </p><p>yet see any signs of a turnaround on other problem areas such </p><p>as the procurement law and tax truce.  Also, there remains a </p><p>disturbing gap between AK\'s "all is well, we are committed to </p><p>reform" rhetoric and its actions. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
