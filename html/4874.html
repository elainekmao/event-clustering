The emphasis of the extensive, </p><p>front-page coverage is on reports that the US has come to </p><p>the stage of discussing a compensation plan for Turkey. </p><p>"Yeni Safak" writes that the US has offered Turkey 20 </p><p>billion dollars, but points out that the amount was short of </p><p>Turkey\'s expectation, which was 28 billion dollars. </p><p>Although "Sabah" talks about a 100 billion dollar plan, the </p><p>general consensus in the press is that Ankara will argue to </p><p>Grossman and Taylor that the possible impact of the war on </p><p>the Turkish economy is 28 billion dollars.  This figure, </p><p>however covers only the economic losses, but does not take </p><p>into account  defense and security-related costs.   Several </p><p>papers also mention that Ankara wants the money directly </p><p>from the US Treasury as opposed to via IMF and World Bank. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FM Yakis at Parliament:  Foreign Minister Yakis briefed the </p><p>Parliament\'s Foreign Affairs Committee about the Iraq </p><p>situation.  MPs are very interested in the US demands from </p><p>Turkey, and Minister Yakis outlined for them the proposed </p><p>deployment of 40,000 US soldiers in Turkey as well as </p><p>permission for a 150-member team of experts to inspect bases </p><p>and ports.  Papers gave conflicting news about the base </p><p>inspections.  "Hurriyet" quotes Yakis as saying "the </p><p>permission for the site inspection has not yet been given," </p><p>while "Radikal" quotes him as saying "the only permission </p><p>given so far is for the site inspection."   Meanwhile, </p><p>Parliament decided to go on recess until January 2, and the </p><p>Iraq issue has been scheduled for parliamentary discussion </p><p>on January 6. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Radikal" reports on the potential problem within the AKP </p><p>government over the Iraq issue following a statement from </p><p>Parliament\'s Human Right Commission Chairman Mehmet Elkatmis </p><p>calling on Ankara to work toward peace and to say "no" to a </p><p>war in the region. </p><p>NSC Meeting:  The National Security Council meeting will be </p><p>not only the last meeting of 2002, but the most crucial one, </p><p>papers speculate.  The agenda is predominantly Iraq,  and </p><p>Turkey\'s answer to Washington\'s demands will be discussed in </p><p>detail.  According to "Radikal" writer Murat Yetkin, the NSC </p><p>decision will be as follows: </p><p>- Deployment of US troops in Turkey on a permanent basis is </p><p>unacceptable, but Turkey can offer the use of Turkish </p><p>territory for the transit of some troops. </p><p>- Site inspection at the airbases and ports can be done. </p><p>- The final decision belongs to the Turkish Parliament, and </p><p>Turkey will continue to seek an international consensus </p><p>under the auspices of the UN. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION:  Iraq </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Hawks, Doves and Owls" </p><p>Hasan Cemal opined in mass appeal Milliyet (12/27): "The US </p><p>goal is to topple Saddam and pave the way for democracy in </p><p>Iraq.  Once this goal is achieved, it will be followed by </p><p>efforts for a peaceful settlement between Israel and </p><p>Palestine and to eliminate fundamentalist roots from the </p><p>region.  Yet the question is how these goals can be </p><p>achieved.  It seems that Washington officials are putting </p><p>their plans on paper, and it all looks fine from a </p><p>theoretical point of view.  . The reality, however, might </p><p>bring  unexpected developments and risks, including a global </p><p>crisis in case US plans fail.  ... Turkey\'s stance seems to </p><p>favor the argument of the owls: Saddam Hussein should go, </p><p>but the US should not conduct this operation alone.  Turkey, </p><p>on the other hand, does not have the luxury of saying to US </p><p>that `I will not be a part of your plan.\'  Thus the ongoing </p><p>bargain between the US and Turkey is about defining the </p><p>extent of Turkey\'s role." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
