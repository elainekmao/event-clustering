ANOTHER COLUMNIST CHARGED THAT: "SHARON AND </p><p>BUSH BEAR RESPONSIBILITY". </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NEWS REPORTS </p><p> </p><p>ALL JORDANIAN DAILIES ON JULY 24 LED WITH REPORTS OF </p><p>THE "INTERNATIONAL CONDEMNATION OF THE ISRAELI MASSACRE </p><p>IN GAZA."   THE FRONT-PAGE REPORTS, WHICH INCLUDED </p><p>PHOTOS OF THE CHILDREN KILLED IN THE RAID, HIGHLIGHTED </p><p>JORDAN\'S CONDEMNATION OF THE RAID AND THE U.S. </p><p>ADMINISTRATION\'S CRITICISM OF IT. </p><p> </p><p>IN SEPARATE STORIES, DAILIES REPORTED THAT: "THE </p><p>ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER EXPRESSED HIS SATISFACTION WITH </p><p>THE MASSACRE," WHICH HE DESCRIBED "A GREAT SUCCESS." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL COMMENTARIES </p><p> </p><p>-- WHEN F-16S BOMB PEACE SETTLEMENT EFFORTS </p><p>COLUMNIST YASSER ABOU HILALEH WROTE IN SEMI-OFFICIAL </p><p>INFLUENTIAL ARABIC DAILY AL-RAI ON JULY 24: "ON THE EVE </p><p>OF THE CRIME HAMAS HAD DECLARED ITS READINESS TO </p><p>SUSPEND OPERATIONS BEYOND 1948 LINE, PALESTINIAN </p><p>OFFICIALS WERE SPEAKING WITH OPTIMISM, AND ARAB FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTERS RETURNED FROM WASHINGTON HAPPY.  THERE WAS </p><p>HOPE OF A SETTLEMENT, BUT SHARON WANTED TO QUASH THIS </p><p>HOPE, NOT TO SAY THIS ILLUSION.  THE ANGER GOES BEYOND </p><p>SHARON TO THE U.S. THAT GIVES HIM HIS F-16S, AND THAT </p><p>GIVES FALSE PROMISES TO THE PALESTINIANS. THE TRAGEDY </p><p>OF GAZA MAY ANSWER THE TRADITIONAL AMERICAN QUESTION: </p><p>`WHY DO THEY HATE US?\'  IT ALSO RAISES MANY NEW </p><p>QUESTIONS ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE SETTLEMENT, THE </p><p>REGION, AND THE WORLD." </p><p> </p><p>-- REVENGE IS JUSTIFIED </p><p>TAHER AL-ADWAN, CHIEF EDITOR OF INDEPENDENT, MASS- </p><p>APPEAL ARABIC DAILY AL-ARAB AL-YAWM WROTE ON JULY 24: </p><p>"AT THE TIME OF WRITING, MORE THAN 12 HOURS AFTER </p><p>SHARON\'S LATEST MASSACRE IN GAZA, AND STILL THERE IS NO </p><p>REACTION FROM THE WHITE HOUSE.  WHITE HOUSE REACTIONS </p><p>TO PALESTINIAN RESISTANCE AGAINST THE OCCUPATION DO NOT </p><p>TAKE MORE THAN 15 TO COME OUT, FULL OF DEROGATORY TERMS </p><p>AGAINST THE PALESTINIANS.  THIS TIME WE WOULD NOT BE </p><p>SURPRISED TO HEAR IT JUSTIFY SHARON AS HAVING ACTED IN </p><p>SELF-DEFENSE.  AND THE AMERICAN MEDIA WILL NOT SHOW IN </p><p>THE U.S. SHOTS OF PALESTINIAN FLESH TORN TO SHREDS BY </p><p>U.S. MADE AIRCRAFT.  THE ONLY PERMISSIBLE FOOTAGE ON </p><p>THE PALESTINIAN-ISRAELI CONFLICT IS OF MARTYRDOM </p><p>BOMBERS.  BUT NOW ALL THE PROMISES OF REVENGE EXPRESS </p><p>NOTHING BUT A LEGITIMATE RIGHT, AND SHARON AND BUSH </p><p>BEAR RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY ESCALATION BECAUSE </p><p>EMPLOYING STATE OF THE ART TECHNOLOGY TO KILL CIVILIANS </p><p>IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT IS THE WORST FORM OF </p><p>TERRORISM." </p><p> </p><p>-- A WAR CRIME IN GAZA </p><p>PROMINENT COLUMNIST URAIB AL-RANTAWI WROTE IN CENTER- </p><p>LEFT, INFLUENTIAL ARABIC DAILY AL-DUSTOUR ON JULY 24: </p><p>"WASHINGTON, WHICH IS NORMALLY FASTER THAN TEL AVIV TO </p><p>CONDEMN ANY PALESTINIAN COMMANDO OPERATION, IS NOW </p><p>SILENT AS A TOMB. SOME MAY SEE THIS AS ENCOURAGING </p><p>SINCE THE TRACK RECORD OF BUSH IS TO DEFEND `ISRAEL\'S </p><p>LEGITIMATE RIGHT OF SELF-DEFENSE.\'  AND KOFI ANNAN, WHO </p><p>COULD NOT FIND IN THE LEXICONS OF THE NUMEROUS </p><p>LANGUAGES THAT HE SPEAKS ADEQUATE TERMS OF CONDEMNATION </p><p>OF THE PALESTINIANS, IS NOW CONTENTED TO EXPRESS REGRET </p><p>THROUGH A SPOKESMAN. STILL, THE MOST DANGEROUS ASPECT </p><p>OF THIS OPERATION IS THAT IT CAME HOURS AFTER HAMAS </p><p>LEADER AHMAD YASSIN ACCEPTED TO SUSPEND MARTYRDOM </p><p>OPERATIONS IF ISRAEL ACCEPTS TO STOP TARGETING </p><p>PALESTINIAN CIVILIANS.  ISRAEL CLEARLY WANTED TO </p><p>SABOTAGE EFFORTS AT A PEACE SETTLEMENT, BECAUSE SUCH A </p><p>SETTLEMENT WOULD IMPOSE ON IT COMMITMENTS THAT IT HAS </p><p>NO WISH OF HONORING."
