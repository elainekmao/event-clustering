<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001390 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PD, AF/S, AF/RA </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, KPAO, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: EDITORIAL URGES NON-COMPLIANCE WITH MEDIA </p><p>CONTROL LAW </p><p> </p><p>1.   Under headline "Moyo: You have lost the plot" the </p><p>   independent weekly "The Standard" dedicated its </p><p>   June 9 editorial to calling on the privately owned </p><p>   media to "simply ignore the restrictions" of the </p><p>   newly enacted Access to Information and Protection </p><p>   of Privacy Act (AIPPA), saying the Act is a </p><p>   "ridiculous piece of legislation."  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>2.   "In the tortuous world of Zimbabwean journalism, </p><p>   the ultimate foolishness has to be (Information </p><p>   Minister) Jonathan Moyo\'s desire to force his </p><p>   deplorable beliefs on the private press and foreign </p><p>   correspondents.  It won\'t happen.  No matter how often </p><p>   he resorts to his grotesque AIPPA, and no matter how </p><p>   many lawsuits he files against privately owned </p><p>   newspapers and no matter how many pseudo-journalists on </p><p>   the lunatic fringe he appoints to his media commission, </p><p>   it still won\'t happen. . . </p><p> </p><p>   "In his anxiety to control everything, . . . </p><p>   Jonathan Moyo has lost the plot.  And for that </p><p>   reason, certain things need to be spelt out plainly </p><p>   so that even he can understand them.  Firstly, the </p><p>   independent press will defy him, his crass </p><p>   legislation - and his cronies.  Independent </p><p>   journalists will not seek registration because that </p><p>   would mean acceding to the rest of the draconian </p><p>   AIPPA. . .  Any journalist, editor or publisher </p><p>   worth his salt will simply ignore the restrictions </p><p>   of the AIPPA. . .  In any event, it\'s impossible in </p><p>   this age of the Internet and satellite </p><p>   communication for governments to control </p><p>   information and to keep information private. . . </p><p>   Someday, Zimbabwe shall again be free, but not </p><p>   before all of us close ranks to fight this </p><p>   absolutely ridiculous piece of legislation - the </p><p>   AIPPA." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
