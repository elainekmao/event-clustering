Perez-Cadalso gave Ambassador a letter </p><p>offering to provide Honduran troops for post-war humanitarian </p><p>needs in Iraq, contingent on congressional approval of such a </p><p>deployment, which he said should not be a problem.  The FM </p><p>reiterated that the GOH had given instructions to oppose any </p><p>UNGA debate on Iraq and that the Honduran UN PermRep\'s </p><p>instructions were to "follow" AMB Negroponte.  Perez-Cadalso </p><p>told Ambassador that, thanks to the USG\'s assistance in </p><p>providing Spanish-language texts, the GOH now had all that it </p><p>needed to proceed with signing and/or ratifying the five UN </p><p>and two OAS counterterrorism conventions/protocols still </p><p>outstanding.  The FM gave Ambassador a copy of draft remarks </p><p>that President Maduro plans to give during the Central </p><p>American presidents meeting with the President April 10. </p><p>Perez-Cadalso also said that Maduro was hoping to have a </p><p>30-minute meeting with the President on the margins of the </p><p>Council of the Americas meetings April 28-29 in Washington. </p><p>The FM said the GOH hoped there would be a final decision on </p><p>Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Hondurans prior to the </p><p>April 10 meeting.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Ambassador and PolOff met April 7 with Honduran </p><p>Minister of Foreign Affairs Guillermo Perez-Cadalso Arias at </p><p>the MFA to discuss Iraq and other key issues.  The meeting </p><p>was a follow-up to the Ambassador\'s April 1 meeting with the </p><p>FM (ref F) and the Ambassador\'s March 28 meeting with </p><p>Honduran President Ricardo Maduro (ref E). </p><p> </p><p>UN PermRep Instructions are "Follow Negroponte" </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) FM Perez-Cadalso started the meeting by telling </p><p>Ambassador that he had spoken with Honduran UN PermRep Manuel </p><p>Acosta Bonilla about Acosta Bonilla\'s March 26 statement </p><p>during the United Nations Security Council open debate on </p><p>Iraq.  The FM said that Acosta Bonilla told him that he was </p><p>trying to speak to the future of post-war Iraq. </p><p>Perez-Cadalso said that Acosta Bonilla had attended USUN\'s </p><p>meeting with the members of the Coalition of the Willing and </p><p>made his remarks in keeping with what he thought USUN wanted </p><p>Coalition members to focus on in their statements.  The FM </p><p>said that Acosta Bonilla was friends with U.S. PermRep </p><p>Negroponte and had been working closely with him in NY. </p><p>Perez-Cadalso said that Acosta Bonilla\'s instructions were to </p><p>"follow Negroponte." </p><p> </p><p>Honduras Will Oppose Iraq Debate in UNGA and UNESCO </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) As previously reported, the MFA has instructed its </p><p>missions at the UN and UNESCO to oppose UNGA debate on Iraq </p><p>(ref D) as proposed by the Arab League via the Non-Aligned </p><p>Movement (ref A), and at the UNESCO Executive Board (ref C) </p><p>as proposed by some countries (ref B).  The FM reiterated to </p><p>the Ambassador that the GOH will vote against any proposed </p><p>UNGA debate on Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>FM Presents Letter Offering Post-War Troops </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  As promised (ref F), the FM gave Ambassador a letter </p><p>formally offering Honduran participation in post-war "phase </p><p>IV" operations in Iraq, saying that both President Maduro and </p><p>Minister of Defense Frederico Breve had approved the offer. </p><p>The letter details the GOH offer to participate in the </p><p>humanitarian aspects of the reconstruction of Iraq, including </p><p>sending troops who specialize in demining and peacekeeping </p><p>troops.  Ambassador thanked Perez-Cadalso for the support of </p><p>the GOH.  The letter notes that any foreign deployment of </p><p>Honduran troops must be approved by congress according to the </p><p>Honduran Constitution.  Perez-Cadalso said he did not think </p><p>that congressional approval would be a problem.  Note:  Post </p><p>does expect the GOH to seek congressional approval until </p><p>after the war is over and the USG had made a more specific </p><p>request for Honduran troops.  End Note.  Post has faxed this </p><p>letter to WHA/CEN and CENTCOM.  An informal translation of </p><p>the letter is in paragraph 12. </p><p> </p><p>Embassy Gives MFA Material on Iraqi War Crimes </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Ambassador gave the FM a copy of the video on the </p><p>1988 massacre of Kurds in Halabja with chemical weapons. </p><p>PolOff had previously given MFA DG for Foreign Policy AMB </p><p>Mario Fortin written material on Iraqi human rights abuses </p><p>and war crimes April 3.  The Ambassador emphasized that the </p><p>President\'s "bold move" in Iraq was bringing the liberation </p><p>of the people of Iraq.  Ambassador noted that he and other </p><p>top EmbOffs would be meeting with key figures in the Honduran </p><p>media April 8 to discuss the war in Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>FM: GOH Has All it Needs on Counterterrorism Conventions </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) Perez-Cadalso told Ambassador that the GOH now had </p><p>all it needed on the counterterrorism conventions/protocols </p><p>and thanked the USG for its assistance in providing </p><p>Spanish-language texts of the two OAS and five UN CT </p><p>conventions/protocols that the GOH has yet to sign and/or </p><p>ratify.  PolOff noted that he had accompanied the French DCM </p><p>April 3 to give a joint G-8 demarche to AMB Fortin on the </p><p>importance of signing and/or ratifying these </p><p>conventions/protocols (ref G).  Both Fortin and the FM noted </p><p>the symbolism of the USG and GOF doing a joint demarche.  The </p><p>FM told Ambassador that the MFA would now begin the </p><p>signature/ratification process and was working with Casa </p><p>Presidencial to forward for congressional approval the CT </p><p>conventions pending with the President\'s office.  Note: </p><p>Since the Ambassador\'s April meeting with the FM (ref F), </p><p>Post has provided the MFA with Spanish-language texts of the </p><p>two ICAO and two IMO outstanding CT conventions/protocols. </p><p>Post thanks the Department, Embassy London, U.S. Mission </p><p>Vienna, and the U.S. Mission to ICAO for their assistance in </p><p>obtaining these texts.  End Note. </p><p> </p><p>FM Gives AMB Draft Text of Maduro\'s CAFTA Meeting Remarks </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) The FM gave Ambassador a copy of the April 7 version </p><p>of President Maduro\'s draft remarks for the Central American </p><p>presidents meeting with the President April 10.  The text </p><p>appears to be very similar to what WHA/CEN faxed Post </p><p>earlier.  Post has faxed these draft remarks to WHA/CEN.  The </p><p>FM said that he and President Maduro are traveling to </p><p>Washington April 9. </p><p> </p><p>Maduro Hopes to Meet With the President in Late April </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) Perez-Cadalso said that the GOH was working to set </p><p>up a half-hour meeting between President Maduro and the </p><p>President on the margins of the April 28-29 Council of the </p><p>Americas 33rd Washington Conference at the State Department, </p><p>where Maduro is scheduled to be a speaker and the President </p><p>is tentatively scheduled to give the keynote address.  The FM </p><p>said that such a meeting would allow Maduro to raise </p><p>bilateral issues that will not be raised in the CAFTA meeting </p><p>with the President. </p><p> </p><p>TPS - FM Asks if Decision Will be Made Prior to April 10 </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) Perez-Cadalso asked Ambassador if the USG will have </p><p>a decision on the GOH\'s request for an extension of Temporary </p><p>Protected Status (TPS) for Hondurans prior to the April 10 </p><p>meeting between the President and the Central American </p><p>presidents.  Ambassador said that he would ask Washington. </p><p> </p><p>GOH Becoming More Active Coalition Participant </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) Comment.  Post is pleased that the GOH seems to be </p><p>taking a more active role as a member of the Coalition of the </p><p>Willing, both with the formal offer of troops for post-war </p><p>Iraq, and with the strong instructions to their missions at </p><p>the UN and UNESCO to oppose debate on Iraq.  This was also </p><p>the first time in recent memory that a senior GOH official </p><p>raised the issue of the outstanding counterterrorism </p><p>conventions/protocols.  In the past it has always been USG </p><p>officials demarching GOH officials to take action.  Post </p><p>intends to hold the GOH to its word that it now has all that </p><p>it needs as far as Spanish-language texts and will move to </p><p>sign and/or ratify the outstanding conventions/protocols. </p><p>End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>Text of Letter Offering Troops for Post-War Iraq </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>12.
