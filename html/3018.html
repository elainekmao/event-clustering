<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 05 ABUJA 001597 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>KAMPALA FOR AID - DAWN LIBERI; RIYADH FOR POL - R. HANKS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O.12958: DECL: 5/23/12 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, ECON, EFIN, EAID, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: A SLIDE IN THE BILATERAL </p><p>RELATIONSHIP </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER. REASON 1.5 </p><p>(B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: The return of democratic government in </p><p>Nigeria brought relief and great expectations in both </p><p>Abuja and Washington. Visions of a strategic </p><p>partnership between the world\'s preeminent republic </p><p>and Africa\'s largest democracy tantalized policymakers </p><p>in both capitals. Committing to significant diplomatic </p><p>support, two successive Administrations in Washington </p><p>labeled Nigeria one of the continent\'s two most </p><p>important countries. In addition to rebuffing military </p><p>rule, Abuja pledged allegiance to economic reform, </p><p>promised to create conditions to attract American </p><p>investment and committed itself to vigorous </p><p>cooperation on transnational issues such as drug- </p><p>trafficking and financial crime. Both nations agreed </p><p>to collaborate in promoting regional stability and </p><p>helping to resolve Africa\'s conflicts. However, after </p><p>three years, the euphoria of 1999 has worn off, with </p><p>an unvarnished realism taking its place. While the </p><p>overall relationship is still very good, differences </p><p>in perception, substance and developments extraneous </p><p>to the bilateral relationship have created frictions </p><p>not there before. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Summary Continued: Dissatisfied with the pace </p><p>and scope of reform here, Washington seems to see </p><p>Nigeria as a strong regional actor but a weak domestic </p><p>player with a government reticent or unable to face </p><p>responsibility for problems such as communal violence </p><p>that are not easily resolved yet cannot be ignored. </p><p>Nigeria believes the USG expects too much, too fast </p><p>and does not provide the types of assistance that </p><p>would accelerate reform and help rescue Nigeria from </p><p>its current morass. As Nigeria moves into electoral </p><p>gear, bilateral strains will increase. To quiet </p><p>criticism that he has reaped little from courting the </p><p>US, Obasanjo pines for high visibility USG assistance, </p><p>e.g. debt relief. Conversely, Washington has little, </p><p>if any, appetite for special debt treatment for </p><p>Nigeria. Yet, Nigeria is too important to let the </p><p>relationship slide. We need to engage the Nigerians </p><p>even more actively on key bilateral issues to develop </p><p>more realistic expectations on both sides and improve </p><p>mutual understanding by broadening the channels of </p><p>communication. While the relationship probably could </p><p>not and should not return to what it was in 1999, </p><p>active policy dialogue can place the relationship on a </p><p>sustainable, pragmatic keel that recognizes common </p><p>interests as well as manages the differences that may </p><p>divide us. We should engage the British in this </p><p>effort. End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN US </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Well-wishers on both sides of the Atlantic </p><p>hoped the inauguration of the Obasanjo Government also </p><p>ushered in an era of good feeling in the bilateral </p><p>relationship. Neither government was immune to this </p><p>optimistic view. Up from the nadir of the Abacha days, </p><p>Nigeria was a country of great potential, promise, </p><p>resources and a highly energetic and gifted </p><p>population. No longer bridled by military rule, </p><p>Nigeria could now gallop toward political and, more </p><p>importantly, economic reform, Washington hoped. </p><p>Through the provision of technical assistance we would </p><p>help them see the "way" and thus effectuate reforms we </p><p>wanted them to make.  The subtext of this assumption </p><p>was that the advent of democracy would quickly make </p><p>the Nigerians begin to think and behave like us. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Nigerians had a different view. They saw the </p><p>return of democracy as the political equivalent of </p><p>sprinkling holy water on the Government of Nigeria. </p><p>Because of their size and rich and expanding resource </p><p>base (oil and gas), they felt that diplomatically </p><p>Nigeria should be among the upper echelon of nations, </p><p>a nation that deserved a "special relationship" with </p><p>the United States. Yet, because of their developmental </p><p>challenges, Nigeria wanted to be the recipient of </p><p>massive doses of tangible assistance. Partly due to a </p><p>prickly national pride, Nigerians believed this </p><p>assistance should be given with few conditions and </p><p>minimal oversight. Psychologically, they were self- </p><p>important to the extent of believing that we needed to </p><p>give them assistance more than they needed to receive </p><p>it. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) We believed the relationship might become </p><p>special if Nigeria achieved significant reforms. </p><p>Nigeria, on the other hand, believed the relationship </p><p>should be inherently special because of its own of </p><p>Nigeria\'s place in the world and the region, reform or </p><p>lack thereof notwithstanding. These different outlooks </p><p>and mutual misperceptions initially were concealed by </p><p>the celebration that accompanied the return of </p><p>democracy. Over time, however, these differences have </p><p>become more visible as celebration yielded to the </p><p>limitations, constraints and frictions of the daily </p><p>workings of the bilateral relationship. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) We discovered that reform would be slow </p><p>everywhere, and glacial in some areas. This languor </p><p>confirmed that many high-level GON officials were not </p><p>truly committed to reform nor were they governing </p><p>according to our democratic precepts. But how could </p><p>they? Many senior GON officials have spent nearly 30 </p><p>years in government service but only seven of those </p><p>years under civilian rule; meaning, they have spent </p><p>nearly a quarter century working and, indeed, </p><p>prospering under different military governments. </p><p>Almost half of all Nigerians never experienced </p><p>democracy before 1999. All Nigerians are more familiar </p><p>with the obtuse workings of military rule than the </p><p>openness of democratic governance. Some key political </p><p>operatives in the Obasanjo Government were one-time </p><p>apologists for military rule. A single round of </p><p>elections was insufficient to change deeply ingrained </p><p>behavior that had been positively reinforced by </p><p>acquisition of wealth and power on the part of these </p><p>officials over the years. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Nigerians did not get the type of assistance </p><p>they desired or expected. While we moved to provide </p><p>technical and advisory assistance aimed at </p><p>institutional and policy reform, the Nigerians wanted </p><p>tangible "stuff" -- money, equipment and goods and </p><p>services -- not advice and feasibility studies. </p><p>Realizing they were not getting what they wanted, </p><p>those Nigerians who hoped for a "special relationship" </p><p>became disillusioned. This sentiment provided </p><p>ammunition to those who sought a correct but not close </p><p>bilateral relationship. For a variety of reasons </p><p>ranging from the enmity generated during the years of </p><p>military rule to different cultural and global </p><p>perspectives, a vocal, at times, very influential </p><p>minority sought to keep us at arm\'s length. This group </p><p>internalized our disputes with the former military </p><p>regimes, misconstruing them as signs of inherent USG </p><p>antipathy toward their country. These hard-liners </p><p>wrongly sense ulterior motives in whatever we do. They </p><p>were reactionary and distrustful -- some just did not </p><p>like us. With the visible exception of General Victor </p><p>Malu\'s public opposition to Operation Focus Relief, </p><p>these die-hards basically receded into the background </p><p>after Obasanjo\'s inauguration. However, the more other </p><p>Nigerians voiced frustration at the perceived lack of </p><p>tangible aid from the USG, the more the USG-bashers </p><p>gloated -- "We told you so." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>TIME TO TAKE STOCK </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) This has fed into a stream of thought that the </p><p>USG is not forthcoming with aid because it sees </p><p>Nigeria as marginal to its interests and therefore is </p><p>indifferent to Nigeria\'s plight. In public and private </p><p>statements about NEPAD, Zimbabwe and debt relief, </p><p>Obasanjo discharged several anti-Western shots that he </p><p>would not have sounded before. During a May 18 meeting </p><p>with Ambassador Jeter, a plaintive Obasanjo remarked </p><p>the U.S. "would not be my friend for long" unless it </p><p>does something about debt relief.  Recently, the </p><p>British Deputy High Commission recounted a protracted </p><p>anti-American diatribe he had heard from a highly </p><p>placed official in the Presidency. These anti-American </p><p>outbursts are disconcerting; however, we also imagine </p><p>this scenario has probably been mirrored in Washington </p><p>with an USG official excoriating Nigeria to fellow USG </p><p>officials or diplomats of a friendly country. </p><p>Statements like these, even though not introduced into </p><p>the public domain, foul the air in the absence of </p><p>concrete measures and alternatives to tackle the </p><p>issues underlying the criticisms. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Gleaned from recent conversations with GON </p><p>officials and other reliable contacts, here are some </p><p>observations and thoughts about the bilateral </p><p>relationship from the Nigerian perspective: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Overall, Nigerians believe the relationship is </p><p>beginning to slide and the USG is increasingly </p><p>indifferent. "The U.S. does not really care what </p><p>happens here," a Presidential insider told a visiting </p><p>American recently. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Debt Relief: This is the centerpiece of GON foreign </p><p>policy toward the US and other Western donors, so much </p><p>so that Obasanjo put enormous amounts of his time and </p><p>prestige on the line. However, Obasanjo has not been </p><p>able to deliver and is frustrated that Washington does </p><p>not seem to attach political importance to the issue. </p><p>Nigerians think Washington has treated debt relief </p><p>bureaucratically -- a "technical issue" -- not the </p><p>major issue it is for Obasanjo and his Administration. </p><p>If the Paris Club declares Nigeria in default at its </p><p>June meeting, the malaise felt here will only deepen. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Obasanjo was incensed when the debt/environment </p><p>swap fell through. First, it was a policy setback. </p><p>Second, he trumpeted our proposal when he returned </p><p>home from Washington only to hear subsequently through </p><p>public channels that the deal had fallen through. " </p><p>You did not even have the courtesy to tell me," he </p><p>lamented. For Obasanjo, this was a significant loss of </p><p>face that mocked his reliance on and belief in the </p><p>United States. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Zimbabwe: This has been highly emotional. Most </p><p>Nigerians, in and out of government, see land </p><p>redistribution as the real basis of the UK\'s </p><p>opposition to Mugabe. Believing the UK was upset </p><p>because most affected farmers were white, the </p><p>Nigerians viewed UK policy as racially motivated and </p><p>biased. They thought the UK raised the red flag on </p><p>elections not so much out of concern for democracy but </p><p>to indirectly thwart GOZ land redistribution to </p><p>previously dispossessed blacks. The GON also felt the </p><p>USG was too closely aligned with the perceived UK </p><p>attempt to scuttle land ownership by blacks in </p><p>Zimbabwe. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Obasanjo bristled at our linkage of support for </p><p>NEPAD to Zimbabwe. He felt we condescendingly tried to </p><p>give him instructions about the mandate of an </p><p>organization he helped to create through consensus </p><p>with other African leaders. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- The GON sees us as a tireless "demandeur"; we are </p><p>constantly presenting demarches and raising issues </p><p>when we want something from them. The UNHRC Cuba </p><p>resolution is a recent case-in-point. After we had </p><p>presented a series of demarches and requests on </p><p>several different topics over the course of a few </p><p>weeks, a senior Presidential Advisor half-jokingly </p><p>began a meeting with the Ambassador stating, "What do </p><p>you want now?" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Military Assistance: Overall, OFR has been </p><p>successful but the failure to carry out OFR-II was a </p><p>disappointment.  While Obasanjo still supports MPRI, </p><p>even he is becoming disillusioned to a degree. Many </p><p>senior military officers resent the program for </p><p>attempting to reshape their military institution and </p><p>its culture without providing concrete assistance in </p><p>the form of equipment or weapons. Some dislike the </p><p>program because contract funds were not being used to </p><p>pay Nigerians but U.S. contractors. Some see the </p><p>program as condescending and a spike at Nigeria\'s </p><p>national honor. We have even heard complaints about </p><p>Avid Recovery because funding for the RONCO contract </p><p>was not passed through Nigerian hands. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- The GON believes it has made achievements on </p><p>privatization and anti-corruption but feels we have </p><p>underestimated the economic and political constraints </p><p>it faces. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Some things the GON sees as commendable, we </p><p>see as demerits or flaws. This is particularly true on </p><p>corruption and economic reform, including </p><p>privatization. Despite what the GON professes, there </p><p>have been no major breakthroughs and Nigeria could have </p><p>and should have done more on these and other fronts. </p><p>Additionally, the way business is conducted in Nigeria </p><p>has not changed much with the Obasanjo Administration. </p><p>It still disadvantages U.S. firms trying to enter the </p><p>Nigerian market or obtain government contracts. </p><p>Repeated losses to European, Japanese and Chinese </p><p>concerns on commercial advocacy compound the </p><p>impression that the door is not open to American </p><p>business and that the distance between our two nations </p><p>is growing. Now, elections are imminent and the rigors </p><p>that occasion them promise to place added strain on </p><p>the bilateral relationship. In his quest to show the </p><p>public he can deliver, Obasanjo will more actively </p><p>cadge us for debt relief. Due to his own weaknesses </p><p>with the electorate, Obasanjo may face a formidable </p><p>challenge. The stiffer the competition, the more he </p><p>will be occupied with protecting his political flank. </p><p>He will be less inclined toward reform or responding </p><p>to our requests for GON alignment with us on important </p><p>issues in multilateral fora. Obasanjo knows that many </p><p>positions he has staked out, e.g. supporting USG </p><p>action in Afghanistan, are not popular in the far </p><p>North, the region where opposition to his reelection </p><p>is perhaps the strongest. Consequently, electoral </p><p>considerations also may compel him to distance himself </p><p>from us. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>CONCLUSION, COMMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) Nigeria is too important to let the </p><p>relationship slide. Because it involves so many </p><p>important issues and due to our cultural and historic </p><p>differences, the relationship will not always be </p><p>easily managed. Yet, it can be an effective </p><p>partnership that advances USG interests in Africa and </p><p>beyond. To do this, we need to broaden and formalize </p><p>bilateral dialogue on the most significant issues. </p><p>This will help identify areas of commonality and </p><p>minimize differences. It will foster better </p><p>understanding while diminishing misperceptions. </p><p>Greater senior-level engagement from Washington would </p><p>help. Concrete steps that can be taken are: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- A visit by A/S Kansteiner in September to meet </p><p>President Obasanjo and other key political players. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- After the Kansteiner visit, we should meet </p><p>discreetly in London with the British and perhaps the </p><p>Canadians to discuss Nigeria. We envision two </p><p>meetings: the first a "political meeting" at the A/S </p><p>level to discuss our collective and individual </p><p>interests in Nigeria; the second, a heads of </p><p>assistance agencies (USAID and its equivalents) </p><p>session to discuss and coordinate assistance to </p><p>Nigeria, particularly for elections and poverty </p><p>alleviation. Measures that we are prepared to take in </p><p>the immediate post-elections period to help </p><p>consolidate democracy also should be examined. How </p><p>these meetings might be shaped will be the subject of </p><p>a separate message; at a minimum our participation, in </p><p>addition to State and AID, should include Treasury, </p><p>NSC and representatives from the Embassy.  We </p><p>understand the British would endorse the proposed </p><p>meetings. Still to be decided is whether Canada would </p><p>or should participate. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- The "post-JEPC" mechanism needs to be initiated. </p><p>This has been stalled for months; however, it </p><p>represents a solid opportunity to link discussion on </p><p>economic reform with cooperation on developing </p><p>concrete trade and investment initiatives. Wedding our </p><p>push for reform with the Nigerians\' desire for </p><p>concrete results, this mechanism could provide a </p><p>practical demonstration of the benefits of close </p><p>cooperation and reform. The more Nigerians see a </p><p>tangible outcome, the more readily they will listen to </p><p>our mantra of reform. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- High-level discussion on debt relief is needed. </p><p>President Obasanjo plans to visit Washington in mid- </p><p>June for the Sullivan Memorial Dinner and will </p><p>participate at the G-8. We should be prepared to </p><p>respond to his expected entreaties on debt relief </p><p>beyond stating that this is a Paris Club issue. We </p><p>need to provide a blueprint that could lead to an </p><p>eventual package of debt relief. Moreover, we need to </p><p>listen to him and show a willingness to be flexible </p><p>and creative while also linking debt relief to genuine </p><p>reform at home. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- We need to have a formal consultation with the GON </p><p>to broadly discuss foreign policy interests. What are </p><p>the fundamental interests and issues for the United </p><p>States and how do these compare with those of Nigeria? </p><p>Most importantly, how do we reconcile differences </p><p>between the two in order to prevent damage to the </p><p>bilateral relationship?  This should take place after </p><p>the London consultations mentioned above. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) Post appreciates Washington\'s quick response </p><p>to the proposals stated in paragraph 11. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
