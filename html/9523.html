<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 004441 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/P - ANNE CASPER, IIP/G/NEA - RAPHAEL </p><p>CALLIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p> </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDANIAN ARTICLE ON "HI" MAGAZINE </p><p> </p><p>1. The following is an Embassy translation of a </p><p>commentary on "Hi", the IIP-funded Arabic language </p><p>magazine now on the stands in Jordan, that appeared in </p><p>the independent, mass appeal Arabic language daily, </p><p>"Al Arab Al Yawm.". </p><p> </p><p>Begin Embassy Translation: </p><p> </p><p>. </p><p>"HI: Connection or Communication?  The First American </p><p>Magazine aimed at Arab Youth </p><p>Report by: Mohammad Hisham Abiyyah, Al Arab Al Yawm </p><p>Daily Newspaper. </p><p> </p><p>Since the events of September 11, 2001, the U.S. </p><p>Administration has decided to turn to the Arab world </p><p>with the huge media arsenal at its disposal, believing </p><p>it could change the impression of the new Arab </p><p>generation, whose fathers remain the main defendants </p><p>in the attack that strongly shook America and </p><p>practically made it realize that there are those who </p><p>truly hate it. </p><p> </p><p>The first of those steps was Radio Sawa, which went on </p><p>the air about a year ago and was devoted to </p><p>broadcasting modern Arabic and English songs in an </p><p>attempt to attract Arab youth to it. Later, it </p><p>intentionally began to mix songs with news from a U.S. </p><p>perspective. Hence, Palestinian resistance operations </p><p>were referred to as "suicide attacks" and Israeli </p><p>assassinations of resistance men were called "targeted </p><p>killings" and the occupation of  Iraq was referred to </p><p>as the liberation of it. </p><p> </p><p>The second step was taken this month, when "Hi" - the </p><p>first U.S. Magazine in Arabic, which is distributed in </p><p>the Middle East, and mainly targets Arab youth - was </p><p>published.  This monthly magazine is edited by a </p><p>number of U.S. and Arab journalists who reside in the </p><p>United States. It also relies on some of those from </p><p>the Arab world who love to write. The magazine </p><p>receives direct support from the State Department, as </p><p>openly stated by the editors in the magazine\'s </p><p>preface. The editors candidly note that the magazine\'s </p><p>main objective is to highlight true stories and U.S. </p><p>values and traditions and to familiarize the Arab </p><p>reader with them, and make him or her realize that </p><p>there are many things that bring humanity closer </p><p>together. The editors also explain why they chose "Hi" </p><p>as the name of the magazine because it is an </p><p>expression that is commonly used when exchanging </p><p>greetings and, hence, becomes a prelude to a dialogue. </p><p>They also note that they focus on Americans - other </p><p>than those famous ones like Michael Jordan, Keanu </p><p>Reeves, Shakira, and Madonna - who live a simple </p><p>normal life away from stardom and Hollywood\'s </p><p>spotlights, space exploration, world stock markets, </p><p>new music, or sports stadiums crowded with spectators. </p><p> </p><p>It is strange that the magazine did not really do what </p><p>it set out to do.  Its first issue is full of reports </p><p>and news about "Michael Jordan", rising Jazz composer </p><p>"Ben Ellison," and "Tony Shalhoub," the actor with </p><p>Lebanese roots who recently received a Golden Globe </p><p>award. This is as if the magazine could not free </p><p>itself from the American lights and appetizers that </p><p>have attracted so many people. </p><p> </p><p>The magazine tries to focus on the experience of Arabs </p><p>in the United States. It sheds light on a number of </p><p>examples such as "Hisham Shami," a Moroccan who </p><p>studies Business Administration and at the same time, </p><p>is considered one of the best Oud players. The </p><p>magazine also sheds light on  "Salima Abdul Ghaffar," </p><p>a brunette journalist who works as an editor for an </p><p>Islamic newspaper published in Atlanta. There is also </p><p>"Suhair Hammad," a poet of Palestinian origin, the </p><p>most famous amongst those who recite poetry on </p><p>Broadway. The magazine also gives lots of room for </p><p>Arab youth to tell the story of their educational </p><p>experience at various American universities. It </p><p>deliberately makes extensive use of photos that show </p><p>many Muslim women that wear the hijab (veil) as an </p><p>indication of the freedom that the Muslims enjoy in </p><p>the United States. It also created a photos section </p><p>titled "American Moments," in which the camera has </p><p>captured snapshots of mountain climbers, moments that </p><p>precede a wedding, and a day at an amusement park, in </p><p>such an attractive way that dazzles the Arab reader. </p><p> </p><p>The first issue of  "Hi" magazine features an </p><p>investigative report on smoking and nargilas (water </p><p>pipe), which were recently introduced in the United </p><p>States and have become quite popular. The reporter is </p><p>dismayed that the price of a nargila in the United </p><p>States reaches $10, while in Egypt one can get it for </p><p>not more than 25 cents.  The magazine also features a </p><p>brief report about Yoga, that says that this sport is </p><p>becoming widespread in Egypt and attributes that to </p><p>American movies, which, according to the report, have </p><p>attracted Egyptian youth to this mental sport! </p><p> </p><p>The magazine invites the Arab reader to write to it </p><p>through its website on numerous topics dealing with </p><p>culture and the Arab environment. It so seems that </p><p>this is one of the main reasons behind publishing this </p><p>magazine. Besides organizing a poetry competition for </p><p>the readers, it also asks them to write about </p><p>important rising figures in the Arab world and about </p><p>differences and similarities between Arab and American </p><p>poetry. The magazine also invites them to write about </p><p>Arabic television programs that discuss marital </p><p>relations and popular exercises and sports in the Arab </p><p>homeland as well as the experience of studying at </p><p>universities in Arab countries and the readers\' most </p><p>favorite Arab celebrities. </p><p> </p><p>On its last page, under the headline "My Story," an </p><p>Arab woman writes about her experience in the Untied </p><p>States, which seems so rosy. She had met in San Diego </p><p>with famous actor Richard Gere, who treated her very </p><p>nicely just because she is an Arab! She also rode in a </p><p>police car in New York just because she wanted to. She </p><p>also tried her luck at the slot machines that are </p><p>widespread in Las Vegas and was very nicely treated by </p><p>the citizens of Virginia! </p><p> </p><p>The Arab reader will surely be overwhelmed by a </p><p>feeling of discomfort when he or she reads the </p><p>magazine, which was printed and produced in an elegant </p><p>and dazzling manner. Even though it seems like a </p><p>bridge extended for communication between Arabs and </p><p>Americans, the magazine avoids reference to any old </p><p>or current political event or issue. It does not </p><p>mention that there is an unbalanced conflict in the </p><p>Middle East between the Palestinians and Israelis. </p><p>Indeed, it does not mention Palestine on its price </p><p>list on the cover and replaces it with Israel. </p><p>Moreover, it did not refer to the presence of a U.S. </p><p>occupation in Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>In doing so, the magazine deliberately focused on </p><p>entertainment in its first issue and, like Radio Sawa, </p><p>might include meaningful political signals in its </p><p>future issues. It also avoided running stories or </p><p>photos that would contradict Arab and Islamic </p><p>traditions. In the mean time, it deliberately focused </p><p>- in an exaggerated manner - on the prosperous life </p><p>that Arabs live in the United States and that such a </p><p>life is so flawless.  The magazine appeared eager to </p><p>hear what Arab readers will tell them about Arab life </p><p>and traditions. The accomplishment of such a thing is </p><p>impossible, however, due to the fact that it is so </p><p>hard for any Arab to tell the Americans in a </p><p>comfortable and simple way about their dreams, </p><p>aspirations, ambitions, problems, the educational </p><p>system in their country, and the actors he or she </p><p>likes in their homeland. </p><p> </p><p>The U.S. forces continue to occupy Iraq, have no </p><p>intention of getting out anytime soon, and are killing </p><p>many Iraqis everyday.  Moreover, U.S. support for </p><p>Israel continues endlessly and, according to the U.S. </p><p>point of view, the Palestinian resistance is blemished </p><p>as terrorism. </p><p> </p><p>All of that, in addition to the exorbitant price of </p><p>the magazine - 9 Egyptian Pounds and 20 Saudi Riyals - </p><p>may stand in the way of getting it across to the Arab </p><p>reader in the first place!" </p><p> </p><p>End Embassy Translation. </p><p> </p><p>NOTE: THIS FULL PAGE REPORT FEATURES A COLOR IMAGE OF </p><p>THE MAGAZINE\'S WEB PAGE. </p><p>HALE </p><p></p></div>
