RANGOON 921 </p><p> </p><p>     B. RANGOON 889 </p><p>     C. WOHLAUER-GLAZEROFF 7/24 EMAIL </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: COM CARMEN MARTINEZ FOR REASONS 1.5 (B,D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: Businesses have faced more trouble than they </p><p>expected from the new U.S. sanctions on Burma.  While local </p><p>traders are scurrying to find a creative solution to their </p><p>financial problems, the Burmese government has refused to </p><p>take any action other than attempt to reassure the business </p><p>community with empty promises that "all will be well."  We </p><p>see a number of likely economic consequences coming in the </p><p>short term, though the X-Factor remains any possible policy </p><p>response by the regime.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>Businesses: Why Me? </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Those in the business community who rely on banks and </p><p>official trade channels are in a panic over the impact of the </p><p>new Burma sanctions.  Because of the pre-sanctions focus on </p><p>minimizing exposure to the ban on imports of Burmese products </p><p>into the United States, few took the time to understand how </p><p>seriously their operations would be curtailed by the ban on </p><p>financial services.  Because legal, non-border, foreign trade </p><p>in Burma is almost exclusively in U.S. dollars, importers and </p><p>exporters have found themselves unable to open new letters of </p><p>credit and unable to easily get payment on letters of credit </p><p>that weren\'t settled before the sanctions took effect at </p><p>12:01 am EST on July 29. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Burmese traders report that their exports and imports </p><p>have ground to a halt as the foreign banks with whom they </p><p>normally do business, mostly in Singapore, have stopped </p><p>honoring letters of credit involving the Burmese state-owned </p><p>foreign trade banks: Myanmar Foreign Trade Bank (MFTB), </p><p>Myanmar Investment and Commercial Bank (MICB), and the </p><p>Myanmar Economic Bank (MEB).  These banks hold the monopoly </p><p>on foreign exchange and official foreign trade transactions. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) A number of European and Asian investors told us that </p><p>the new obstacles caused by the financial sanctions, combined </p><p>with the dismal pre-existing investment climate, will make it </p><p>impossible to stay in Burma.  A Korean diplomat told the DCM </p><p>that Korean investors in the garment sector (30-40 </p><p>individuals or firms) are beginning to seriously explore </p><p>options for decamping to Sri Lanka, Vietnam, or just across </p><p>the border into Thailand.  Those foreign investors that </p><p>choose to remain will likely fall into three categories: </p><p>those who are able to make their money on illegal border </p><p>trade or border trade in Chinese yuan or Thai baht, those who </p><p>can arrange barter trade, and those who foolishly believe the </p><p>sanctions will be lifted as soon as Aung San Suu Kyi is </p><p>released.  This latter bit of wishful thinking is widespread, </p><p>despite our repeated public assurances to the contrary. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) However, despite their agitation, most local traders </p><p>with whom we spoke were sanguine that they would find a </p><p>creative solution to what is merely the latest obstacle to </p><p>their doing business.  Said one, "our government has been </p><p>imposing their sanctions on us for 40 years, so we\'ll have no </p><p>trouble adapting to yours."  Indeed, some of our more wily </p><p>business contacts report that they\'ve already established new </p><p>modus vivendi to continue their trading businesses without </p><p>problem. </p><p> </p><p>Government: Who Us? </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) According to several business sources, the Ministry of </p><p>Commerce and the Office of the SPDC Chairman co-hosted an </p><p>emergency session on the new sanctions on August 4 for </p><p>Burmese traders.  The well-attended meeting went about one </p><p>hour with presentations by the Minister of Commerce, the </p><p>Minister of Economic Development and National Planning, a </p><p>minister from the SPDC Chairman\'s office, and the Deputy </p><p>Finance Minister.  Despite the augustness of the presenters, </p><p>all reports indicate that the GOB had no advice for the </p><p>panicky businesspeople other than to continue on as best they </p><p>can in the new environment, and to resolve any specific </p><p>concerns with their bankers.  The policymakers offered no </p><p>hint of any pending regime reaction to the new sanctions, and </p><p>only mentioned in passing the wisdom of expanding barter </p><p>trade or conducting commerce in a currency other than the </p><p>U.S. dollar. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Businesspeople close to government economic officials </p><p>tell us that the regime is still in a state of denial, poorly </p><p>understanding the full impact of the sanctions on the </p><p>country\'s official trade sector.  Apparently these officials, </p><p>and likely those above them, are still clinging to the </p><p>expectation that China and/or India will come to Burma\'s </p><p>financial assistance -- an expectation that may have some </p><p>merit (see Ref B and C). </p><p>8. (C) Aside from a virulent July 31st attack on U.S. </p><p>sanctions policy by SPDC Secretary One General Khin Nyunt, </p><p>there has been little public GOB response since the sanctions </p><p>were imposed.  A report written for SPDC Secretary Two Lt. </p><p>General Soe Win on the Embassy\'s sanctions briefing on July </p><p>31st (Ref A) was very factual, accurately summarizing the </p><p>briefing\'s contents with no editorial commentary.  Likewise, </p><p>the Minister of Commerce\'s session for traders reportedly </p><p>contained no anti-U.S. rhetoric or finger pointing. </p><p> </p><p>The Future: Who Knows? </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Over the next few weeks and months, we see the </p><p>following as some of the possible specific consequences of </p><p>the sanctions: unemployment as garment factories and other </p><p>employers shutter for lack of business; a sharp reduction in </p><p>the GOB\'s official reserves as the inflow of legal U.S. </p><p>dollars stops; an increase in the already large, </p><p>predominately U.S. dollar-denominated informal economy </p><p>(especially border trade); a resulting boost for neighboring </p><p>economies and for the ethnic groups that control key border </p><p>trade areas; an increase in the kyat value of the U.S. dollar </p><p>as supplies dwindle and importers must buy cash from the </p><p>marketplace; and, a steady decrease in the kyat value of the </p><p>U.S. dollar denominated Foreign Exchange Certificate.  Though </p><p>the economic problems will ripple through the middle class, </p><p>and then into the working class as unemployment results from </p><p>the expected shuttering of factories and other employers, it </p><p>is far too early to predict any social unrest. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) The X-Factor is the reaction of the Burmese </p><p>government.  It could ease the woes of local traders by </p><p>publicly encouraging trade in another foreign currency or </p><p>loosening import restrictions (which currently require </p><p>importers to hold offsetting accounts of U.S. dollar export </p><p>proceeds in a government bank account).  It could also go the </p><p>other direction, conserving precious foreign exchange by </p><p>enforcing more strictly existing foreign exchange control </p><p>laws that forbid Burmese citizens from holding foreign </p><p>currency, or tightening import restrictions. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
