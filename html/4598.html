<p>UNCLAS VATICAN 005836 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EUR/RPM AD EUR/WE (MENNUTI) </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, VT, OSCE </p><p>SUBJECT: HOLY SEE NOT SUPPORTIVE OF SEPARATE OSCE </p><p>ANTI-SEMITISM MEETING </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) STATE 228101 B) USOSCE 1433 C) STATE 239512 </p><p> </p><p> 1. (SBU)  POLOFF REVIEWED REFS (A) AND (B) DISCUSSION OF A </p><p>SPECIAL SESSION ON ANTI-SEMITISM NOVEMBER 16 WITH VATICAN </p><p>OSCE DIRECTOR MONS. ETTORE BALESTRERO, FOCUSING ON THE NEED </p><p>FOR A STAND-ALONE MEETING TO DISCUSS ANTI-SEMITISM. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  05836  040931Z </p><p>BALESTRERO SAID THE HOLY SEE SHARED THE USG\'S CONCERNS AND </p><p>INDICATED HE WOULD UNDERTAKE TO SEE HOW THE HOLY SEE OSCE </p><p>DELEGATION MIGHT BE ABLE TO WORK WITH THE U.S. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) DCM FOLLOWED UP WITH VATICAN DFM CELESTINO MIGLIORE </p><p>NOVEMBER 25, DEPLOYING REF (C) POINTS AND EMPHASIZING THE </p><p>IMPORTANCE THE USG ATTACHED TO HAVING A SEPARATE OSCE MEETING </p><p>DEVOTED TO ANTI-SEMITISM.  MIGLIORE RESPONDED THAT THE HOLY </p><p>SEE WAS "HESITANT" TO ACCEPT THIS PROPOSAL, "NOT BECAUSE WE </p><p>ARE NOT CONVINCED OF THE NEED TO COMBAT ANTI-SEMITISM." </p><p>RATHER, THEY WERE CONCERNED THAT IF THE OSCE WERE TO HOLD A </p><p>SPECIAL SESSION ON ANTI-SEMITISM, THE OSCE WOULD HAVE TO </p><p>EXPLAIN WHY IT WAS NOT HOLDING SPECIAL SESSIONS ON THE ROMA, </p><p>SINTI, AND OTHER GROUPS FACING RACISM OR XENOPHOBIA.  HE FELT </p><p>THIS WOULD DILUTE THE STATEMENT CONDEMNING DISCRIMINATION </p><p>THAT WOULD COME OUT OF OPORTO.  THE PROBLEM, MIGLIORE </p><p>REITERATED, WAS THAT "SOMEONE WILL ALWAYS SAY THAT THEIR </p><p>SPECIFIC PROBLEMS HAVE BEEN LEFT OUT, AND WE WILL INEVITABLY </p><p>DISAPPOINT SOME GROUP." </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) DCM RESPONDED THAT THE USG REGARDS ANTI-SEMITISM AS </p><p>A UNIQUE HISTORICAL PROBLEM THAT MERITS STAND-ALONE </p><p>TREATMENT.  MOREOVER, WE BELIEVE THAT SUCH TREATMENT WOULD </p><p>STRENGTHEN THE OSCE\'S ABILITY TO DEAL WITH OTHER FORMS OF </p><p>RACISM AND XENOPHOBIA.  MIGLIORE RESPONDED THAT HE UNDERSTOOD </p><p>THAT THE OPPOSITION TO A SPECIAL SESSION FOR ANTI-SEMITISM </p><p>WAS WIDELY SHARED BY MANY DELEGATIONS, AND THAT HE FOUND IT </p><p>WELL-GROUNDED.  HE REITERATED HIS VIEW THAT THE OPORTO </p><p>STATEMENT WOULD BE STRONGER IF IT REMAINED ON A MORE GENERAL </p><p>LEVEL. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  05836  040931Z </p><p>4.  (SBU)  DCM REPEATED THAT THE U.S. STRONGLY BELIEVED THE </p><p>ISSUE SHOULD BE SPECIFICALLY RAISED IN OPORTO AND STRONGLY </p><p>FAVORED A SUBSEQUENT SEPARATE MEETING.  HE URGED MIGLIORE TO </p><p>KEEP AN OPEN MIND, AND TO WORK WITH OUR DELEGATION IN VIENNA </p><p>AND OPORTO TO ACHIEVE AGREEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>NICHOLSON </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> </p><p></p><p> 2002VATICA05836 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
